SHERIDAN, VOLUME 1.\r\n\r\nBy Philip Henry Sheridan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nWhen, yielding to the solicitations of my friends, I finally decided\r\nto write these Memoirs, the greatest difficulty which confronted me\r\nwas that of recounting my share in the many notable events of the\r\nlast three decades, in which I played a part, without entering too\r\nfully into the history of these years, and at the same time without\r\ngiving to my own acts an unmerited prominence.  To what extent I have\r\novercome this difficulty I must leave the reader to judge.\r\n\r\nIn offering this record, penned by my own hand, of the events of my\r\nlife, and of my participation in our great struggle for national\r\nexistence, human liberty, and political equality, I make no\r\npretension to literary merit; the importance of the subject-matter of\r\nmy narrative is my only claim on the reader's attention.\r\n\r\nRespectfully dedicating this work to my comrades in arms during the\r\nWar of the Rebellion, I leave it as a heritage to my children, and as\r\na source of information for the future historian.\r\n\r\nP. H. SHERIDAN.\r\n\r\nNonguitt, Mass., August 2, 1888\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSONAL MEMOIRS\r\n\r\nP. H. SHERIDAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME I.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nANCESTRY--BIRTH--EARLY EDUCATION--A CLERK IN A GROCERY\r\nSTORE--APPOINTMENT--MONROE SHOES--JOURNEY TO WEST POINT--HAZING\r\n--A FISTICUFF BATTLE--SUSPENDED--RETURNS TO CLERKSHIP--GRADUATION.\r\n\r\nMy parents, John and Mary Sheridan, came to America in 1830, having\r\nbeen induced by the representations of my father's uncle, Thomas\r\nGainor, then living in Albany, N. Y., to try their fortunes in the\r\nNew World: They were born and reared in the County Cavan, Ireland,\r\nwhere from early manhood my father had tilled a leasehold on the\r\nestate of Cherrymoult; and the sale of this leasehold provided him\r\nwith means to seek a new home across the sea.  My parents were\r\nblood relations--cousins in the second degree--my mother, whose\r\nmaiden name was Minor, having descended from a collateral branch of\r\nmy father's family.  Before leaving Ireland they had two children,\r\nand on the 6th of March, 1831, the year after their arrival in this\r\ncountry, I was born, in Albany, N. Y., the third child in a family\r\nwhich eventually increased to six--four boys and two girls.\r\n\r\nThe prospects for gaining a livelihood in Albany did not meet the\r\nexpectations which my parents had been led to entertain, so in 1832\r\nthey removed to the West, to establish themselves in the village of\r\nSomerset, in Perry County, Ohio, which section, in the earliest days\r\nof the State; had been colonized from Pennsylvania and Maryland.  At\r\nthis period the great public works of the Northwest--the canals and\r\nmacadamized roads, a result of clamor for internal improvements--were\r\nin course of construction, and my father turned his attention to\r\nthem, believing that they offered opportunities for a successful\r\noccupation.  Encouraged by a civil engineer named Bassett, who had\r\ntaken a fancy to him, he put in bids for a small contract on the\r\nCumberland Road, known as the \"National Road,\" which was then being\r\nextended west from the Ohio River.  A little success in this first\r\nenterprise led him to take up contracting as a business, which he\r\nfollowed on various canals and macadamized roads then building in\r\ndifferent parts of the State of Ohio, with some good fortune for\r\nawhile, but in 1853 what little means he had saved were swallowed up\r\n--in bankruptcy, caused by the failure of the Sciota and Hocking\r\nValley Railroad Company, for which he was fulfilling a contract at\r\nthe time, and this disaster left him finally only a small farm, just\r\noutside the village of Somerset, where he dwelt until his death in\r\n1875.\r\n\r\nMy father's occupation kept him away from home much of the time\r\nduring my boyhood, and as a consequence I grew up under the sole\r\nguidance and training of my mother, whose excellent common sense and\r\nclear discernment in every way fitted her for such maternal duties.\r\nWhen old enough I was sent to the village school, which was taught by\r\nan old-time Irish \"master\"--one of those itinerant dominies of the\r\nearly frontier--who, holding that to spare the rod was to spoil the\r\nchild, if unable to detect the real culprit when any offense had been\r\ncommitted, would consistently apply the switch to the whole school\r\nwithout discrimination.  It must be conceded that by this means he\r\nnever failed to catch the guilty mischief-maker.  The school-year was\r\ndivided into terms of three months, the teacher being paid in each\r\nterm a certain sum--three dollars, I think, for each pupil-and having\r\nan additional perquisite in the privilege of boarding around at his\r\noption in the different families to which his scholars belonged.\r\nThis feature was more than acceptable to the parents at times, for\r\nhow else could they so thoroughly learn all the neighborhood gossip?\r\nBut the pupils were in almost unanimous opposition, because Mr.\r\nMcNanly's unheralded advent at any one's house resulted frequently in\r\nthe discovery that some favorite child had been playing \"hookey,\"\r\nwhich means (I will say to the uninitiated, if any such there be)\r\nabsenting one's self from school without permission, to go on a\r\nfishing or a swimming frolic.  Such at least was my experience more\r\nthan once, for Mr. McNanly particularly favored my mother's house,\r\nbecause of a former acquaintanceship in Ireland, and many a time a\r\ncomparison of notes proved that I had been in the woods with two\r\nplayfellows, named Binckly and Greiner, when the master thought I was\r\nhome, ill, and my mother, that I was at school, deeply immersed in\r\nstudy.  However, with these and other delinquencies not uncommon\r\namong boys, I learned at McNanly's school, and a little later, under\r\na pedagogue named Thorn, a smattering of geography and history, and\r\nexplored the mysteries of Pike's Arithmetic and Bullions' English\r\nGrammar, about as far as I could be carried up to the age of\r\nfourteen.  This was all the education then bestowed upon me, and\r\nthis--with the exception of progressing in some of these branches by\r\nvoluntary study, and by practical application in others, supplemented\r\nby a few months of preparation after receiving my appointment as a\r\ncadet--was the extent of my learning on entering the Military\r\nAcademy.\r\n\r\nWhen about fourteen years old I began to do something for myself; Mr.\r\nJohn Talbot, who kept a country store in the village, employing me to\r\ndeal out sugar, coffee, and calico to his customers at the munificent\r\nsalary of twenty-four dollars a year.  After I had gained a\r\ntwelve-months' experience with Mr. Talbot my services began to be\r\nsought by, others, and a Mr. David Whitehead secured them by the offer\r\nof sixty dollars a year--Talbot refusing to increase my pay, but not\r\nobjecting to my advancement.  A few months later, before my year was\r\nup, another chance to increase my salary came about; Mr. Henry Dittoe,\r\nthe enterprising man of the village, offering me one hundred and\r\ntwenty dollars a year to take a position in the dry-goods store of\r\nFink & Dittoe.  I laid the matter before Mr. Whitehead, and he frankly\r\nadvised me to accept, though he cautioned me that I might regret it,\r\nadding that he was afraid Henry (referring to Mr. Dittoe) \"had too\r\nmany irons in the fire.\" His warning in regard to the enterprising\r\nmerchant proved a prophecy, for \"too many irons in the fire\" brought\r\nabout Mr. Dittoe's bankruptcy, although this misfortune did not befall\r\nhim till long after I had left his service.  I am glad to say,\r\nhowever, that his failure was an exceptionally honest one, and due\r\nmore to the fact that he was in advance of his surroundings than to\r\nany other cause.\r\n\r\nI remained with Fink & Dittoe until I entered the Military Academy,\r\nprincipally in charge of the book-keeping, which was no small work\r\nfor one of my years, considering that in those days the entire\r\nbusiness of country stores in the West was conducted on the credit\r\nsystem; the customers, being mostly farmers, never expecting to pay\r\ntill the product of their farms could be brought to market; and even\r\nthen usually squared the book-accounts by notes of hand, that were\r\noften slow of collection.\r\n\r\nFrom the time I ceased to attend school my employment had\r\nnecessitated, to a certain degree, the application of what I had\r\nlearned there, and this practical instruction I reinforced somewhat\r\nby doing considerable reading in a general way, until ultimately I\r\nbecame quite a local authority in history, being frequently chosen as\r\narbiter in discussions and disputes that arose in the store.  The\r\nMexican War, then going on, furnished, of course, a never-ending\r\ntheme for controversy, and although I was too young to enter the\r\nmilitary service when volunteers were mustering in our section, yet\r\nthe stirring events of the times so much impressed and absorbed me\r\nthat my sole wish was to become a soldier, and my highest aspiration\r\nto go to West Point as a Cadet from my Congressional district.  My\r\nchances for this seemed very remote, however, till one day an\r\nopportunity was thrown in my way by the boy who then held the place\r\nfailing to pass his examination.  When I learned that by this\r\noccurrence a vacancy existed, I wrote to our representative in\r\nCongress, the Hon. Thomas Ritchey, and asked him for the appointment,\r\nreminding him that we had often met in Fink & Dittoe's store, and\r\nthat therefore he must know something of my qualifications.  He\r\nresponded promptly by enclosing my warrant for the class of 1848; so,\r\nnotwithstanding the many romances that have been published about the\r\nmatter, to Mr. Ritchey, and to him alone, is due all the credit--if\r\nmy career justifies that term--of putting me in the United States\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\nAt once I set about preparing for the examination which precedes\r\nadmission to the Military Academy, studying zealously under the\r\ndirection of Mr. William Clark; my old teachers, McNanly and Thorn,\r\nhaving disappeared from Somerset and sought new fields of usefulness.\r\nThe intervening months passed rapidly away, and I fear that I did not\r\nmake much progress, yet I thought I should be able to pass the\r\npreliminary examination.  That which was to follow worried me more\r\nand gave me many sleepless nights; but these would have been less in\r\nnumber, I fully believe, had it not been for one specification of my,\r\noutfit which the circular that accompanied my appointment demanded.\r\nThis requirement was a pair of \"Monroe shoes.\"  Now, out in Ohio,\r\nwhat \"Monroe shoes\" were was a mystery--not a shoemaker in my section\r\nhaving so much as an inkling of the construction of the perplexing\r\nthings, until finally my eldest brother brought an idea of them from\r\nBaltimore, when it was found that they were a familiar pattern under\r\nanother name.\r\n\r\nAt length the time for my departure came, and I set out for West\r\nPoint, going by way of Cleveland and across Lake Erie to Buffalo.  On\r\nthe steamer I fell in with another appointee en route to the academy,\r\nDavid S. Stanley, also from Ohio; and when our acquaintanceship had\r\nripened somewhat, and we had begun to repose confidence in each\r\nother, I found out that he had no \"Monroe shoes,\" so I deemed myself\r\njust that much ahead of my companion, although my shoes might not\r\nconform exactly to the regulations in Eastern style and finish.  At\r\nBuffalo, Stanley and I separated, he going by the Erie Canal and I by\r\nthe railroad, since I wanted to gain time on account of commands to\r\nstop in Albany to see my father's uncle.  Here I spent a few days,\r\ntill Stanley reached Albany, when we journeyed together down the\r\nriver to West Point.  The examination began a few days after our\r\narrival, and I soon found myself admitted to the Corps of Cadets, to\r\ndate from July 1, 1848, in a class composed of sixty-three members,\r\nmany of whom--for example, Stanley, Slocum, Woods, Kautz, and Crook\r\n--became prominent generals in later years, and commanded divisions,\r\ncorps, and armies in the war of the rebellion.\r\n\r\nQuickly following my admission I was broken in by a course of hazing,\r\nwith many of the approved methods that the Cadets had handed down\r\nfrom year to year since the Academy was founded; still, I escaped\r\nexcessive persecution, although there were in my day many occurrences\r\nso extreme as to call forth condemnation and an endeavor to suppress\r\nthe senseless custom, which an improved civilization has now about\r\neradicated, not only at West Point, but at other colleges.\r\n\r\nAlthough I had met the Academic board and come off with fair success,\r\nyet I knew so little of Algebra or any of the higher branches of\r\nmathematics that during my first six months at the Academy I was\r\ndiscouraged by many misgivings as to the future, for I speedily\r\nlearned that at the January examination the class would have to stand\r\na test much severer than that which had been applied to it on\r\nentering.  I resolved to try hard, however, and, besides, good\r\nfortune gave me for a room-mate a Cadet whose education was more\r\nadvanced than mine, and whose studious habits and willingness to aid\r\nothers benefited me immensely.  This room-mate was Henry W. Slocum,\r\nsince so signally distinguished in both military and civil capacities\r\nas to win for his name a proud place in the annals of his country.\r\nAfter taps--that is, when by the regulations of the Academy all the\r\nlights were supposed to be extinguished, and everybody in bed--Slocum\r\nand I would hang a blanket over the one window of our room and\r\ncontinue our studies--he guiding me around scores of stumbling-blocks\r\nin Algebra and elucidating many knotty points in other branches of\r\nthe course with which I was unfamiliar.  On account of this\r\nassociation I went up before the Board in January with less\r\nuneasiness than otherwise would have been the case, and passed the\r\nexamination fairly well.  When it was over, a self-confidence in my\r\ncapacity was established that had not existed hitherto, and at each\r\nsucceeding examination I gained a little in order of merit till my\r\nfurlough summer came round--that is, when I was half through the\r\nfour-year course.\r\n\r\nMy furlough in July and August, 1850, was spent at my home in Ohio,\r\nwith the exception of a visit or two to other Cadets on furlough in\r\nthe State, and at the close of my leave I returned to the Academy in\r\nthe full expectation of graduating with my class in 1852.\r\n\r\nA quarrel of a belligerent character in September, ,1851, with Cadet\r\nWilliam R. Terrill, put an end to this anticipation, however, and\r\nthrew me back into the class which graduated in 1853.  Terrill was a\r\nCadet Sergeant, and, while my company was forming for parade, having,\r\ngiven me an order, in what I considered an improper tone, to \"dress\"\r\nin a certain direction, when I believed I was accurately dressed, I\r\nfancied I had a grievance, and made toward him with a lowered\r\nbayonet, but my better judgment recalled me before actual contact\r\ncould take place.  Of course Terrill reported me for this, and my ire\r\nwas so inflamed by his action that when we next met I attacked him,\r\nand a fisticuff engagement in front of barracks followed, which was\r\nstopped by an officer appearing on the scene.  Each of us handed in\r\nan explanation, but mine was unsatisfactory to the authorities, for I\r\nhad to admit that I was the assaulting party, and the result was that\r\nI was suspended by the Secretary of War, Mr. Conrad, till August 28,\r\n1852--the Superintendent of the Academy, Captain Brewerton, being\r\ninduced to recommend this milder course, he said, by my previous good\r\nconduct.  At the time I thought, of course, my suspension a very\r\nunfair punishment, that my conduct was justifiable and the\r\nauthorities of the Academy all wrong, but riper experience has led me\r\nto a different conclusion, and as I look back, though the\r\nmortification I then endured was deep and trying, I am convinced that\r\nit was hardly as much as I deserved for such an outrageous breach of\r\ndiscipline.\r\n\r\nThere was no question as to Terrill's irritating tone, but in giving\r\nme the order he was prompted by the duty of his position as a file\r\ncloser, and I was not the one to remedy the wrong which I conceived\r\nhad been done me, and clearly not justifiable in assuming to correct\r\nhim with my own hands.  In 1862, when General Buell's army was\r\nassembling at Louisville, Terrill was with it as a brigadier-general\r\n(for, although a Virginian, he had remained loyal), and I then took\r\nthe initiative toward a renewal of our acquaintance.  Our renewed\r\nfriendship was not destined to be of long duration, I am sorry to\r\nsay, for a few days later, in the battle of Perryville, while\r\ngallantly fighting for his country, poor Terrill was killed.\r\n\r\nMy suspension necessitated my leaving the Academy, and I returned\r\nhome in the fall of 1851, much crestfallen.  Fortunately, my good\r\nfriend Henry Dittoe again gave me employment in keeping the books of\r\nhis establishment, and this occupation of my time made the nine\r\nmonths which were to elapse before I could go back to West Point pass\r\nmuch more agreeably than they would have done had I been idle.  In\r\nAugust, 1852, I joined the first class at the Academy in accordance\r\nwith the order of the War Department, taking my place at the foot of\r\nthe class and graduating with it the succeeding June, number\r\nthirty-four in a membership of fifty-two.  At the head of this class\r\ngraduated James B. McPherson, who was killed in the Atlanta campaign\r\nwhile commanding the Army of the Tennessee.  It also contained such\r\nmen as John M. Schofield, who commanded the Army of the Ohio; Joshua\r\nW. Sill, killed as a brigadier in the battle of Stone River; and many\r\nothers who, in the war of the rebellion, on one side or the other,\r\nrose to prominence, General John B. Hood being the most distinguished\r\nmember of the class among the Confederates.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the final examination I made no formal application\r\nfor assignment to any particular arm of the service, for I knew that\r\nmy standing would not entitle me to one of the existing vacancies,\r\nand that I should be obliged to take a place among the brevet second\r\nlieutenants.  When the appointments were made I therefore found\r\nmyself attached to the First Infantry, well pleased that I had\r\nsurmounted all the difficulties that confront the student at our\r\nnational school, and looking forward with pleasant anticipation to\r\nthe life before me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nORDERED TO FORT DUNCAN, TEXAS--\"NORTHERS\"--SCOUTING\r\nDUTY--HUNTING--NEARLY CAUGHT BY THE INDIANS--A PRIMITIVE HABITATION\r\n--A BRAVE DRUMMERBOY'S DEATH--A MEXICAN BALL.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st day of July, 1853, I was commissioned a brevet second\r\nlieutenant in the First Regiment of United States Infantry, then\r\nstationed in Texas.  The company to which I was attached was\r\nquartered at Fort Duncan, a military post on the Rio Grande opposite\r\nthe little town of Piedras Negras, on the boundary line between the\r\nUnited States and the Republic of Mexico.\r\n\r\nAfter the usual leave of three months following graduation from the\r\nMilitary Academy I was assigned to temporary duty at Newport\r\nBarracks, a recruiting station and rendezvous for the assignment of\r\nyoung officers preparatory to joining their regiments.  Here I\r\nremained from September, 1853, to March, 1854, when I was ordered to\r\njoin my company at Fort Duncan.  To comply with this order I\r\nproceeded by steamboat down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers to New\r\nOrleans, thence by steamer across the Gulf of Mexico to Indianola,\r\nTex., and after landing at that place, continued in a small schooner\r\nthrough what is called the inside channel on the Gulf coast to Corpus\r\nChristi, the headquarters of Brigadier-General Persifer F. Smith, who\r\nwas commanding the Department of Texas.  Here I met some of my old\r\nfriends from the Military Academy, among them Lieutenant Alfred\r\nGibbs, who in the last year of the rebellion commanded under me a\r\nbrigade of cavalry, and Lieutenant Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte, of the\r\nMounted Rifles, who resigned in 1854 to accept service in the French\r\nImperial army, but to most of those about headquarters I was an\r\nentire stranger.  Among the latter was Captain Stewart Van Vliet, of\r\nthe Quartermaster's Department, now on the retired list.  With him I\r\nsoon came in frequent contact, and, by reason of his connection with\r\nthe Quartermaster's Department, the kindly interest he took in\r\nforwarding my business inaugurated between us--a lasting friendship.\r\n\r\nA day or two after my arrival at Corpus Christi a train of Government\r\nwagons, loaded with subsistence stores and quartermaster's supplies,\r\nstarted for Laredo, a small town on the Rio Grande below Fort Duncan.\r\nThere being no other means of reaching my station I put my small\r\npersonal possessions, consisting of a trunk, mattress, two blankets,\r\nand a pillow into one of the heavily loaded wagons and proceeded to\r\njoin it, sitting on the boxes or bags of coffee and sugar, as I might\r\nchoose.  The movement of the train was very slow, as the soil was\r\nsoft on the newly made and sandy roads.  We progressed but a few\r\nmiles on our first day's journey, and in the evening parked our train\r\nat a point where there was no wood, a scant supply of water--and that\r\nof bad quality--but an abundance of grass.  There being no\r\ncomfortable place to sleep in any of the wagons, filled as they were\r\nto the bows with army supplies, I spread my blankets on the ground\r\nbetween the wheels of one of them, and awoke in the morning feeling\r\nas fresh and bright as would have been possible if all the comforts\r\nof civilization had been at my command.\r\n\r\nIt took our lumbering train many days to reach Laredo, a distance of\r\nabout one hundred and sixty miles from Corpus Christi.  Each march\r\nwas but a repetition of the first day's journey, its monotony\r\noccasionally relieved, though, by the passage of immense flocks of\r\nducks and geese, and the appearance at intervals of herds of deer,\r\nand sometimes droves of wild cattle, wild horses and mules.  The\r\nbands of wild horses I noticed were sometimes led by mules, but\r\ngenerally by stallions with long wavy manes, and flowing tails which\r\nalmost touched the ground.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Laredo during one of those severe storms incident to\r\nthat section, which are termed \"Northers\" from the fact that the\r\nnorth winds culminate occasionally in cold windstorms, frequently\r\npreceded by heavy rains.  Generally the blow lasts for three days,\r\nand the cold becomes intense and piercing.  While the sudden\r\ndepression of the temperature is most disagreeable, and often causes\r\ngreat suffering, it is claimed that these \"Northers\" make the climate\r\nmore healthy and endurable.  They occur from October to May, and in\r\naddition to the destruction which, through the sudden depression of\r\nthe temperature, they bring on the herds in the interior, they are\r\noften of sufficient violence to greatly injure the harbors on the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nThe post near Laredo was called Fort McIntosh, and at this period the\r\ntroops stationed there consisted of eight companies of the Fifth\r\nInfantry and two of the First, one of the First Artillery, and three\r\nof the Mounted Rifles.  Just before the \"Norther\" began these troops\r\nhad completed a redoubt for the defense of the post, with the\r\nexception of the ditches, but as the parapet was built of sand--the\r\nonly material about Laredo which could be obtained for its\r\nconstruction--the severity of the winds was too much for such a\r\nshifting substance, and the work was entirely blown away early in the\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\nI was pleasantly and hospitably welcomed by the officers at the post,\r\nall of whom were living in tents, with no furniture except a cot and\r\ntrunk, and an improvised bed for a stranger, when one happened to\r\ncome along.  After I had been kindly taken in by one of the younger\r\nofficers, I reported to the commanding officer, and was informed by\r\nhim that he would direct the quartermaster to furnish me, as soon as\r\nconvenient, with transportation to Fort Duncan, the station of my\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a day or two, the quartermaster notified me that a\r\nGovernment six-mule wagon would be placed at my disposal to proceed\r\nto my destination.  No better means offering, I concluded to set out\r\nin this conveyance, and, since it was also to carry a quantity of\r\nquartermaster's property for Fort Duncan, I managed to obtain room\r\nenough for my bed in the limited space between the bows and load,\r\nwhere I could rest tolerably well, and under cover at night, instead\r\nof sleeping on the ground under the wagon, as I had done on the road\r\nfrom Corpus Christi to Laredo.\r\n\r\nI reached Fort Duncan in March, 1854., and was kindly received by the\r\ncommanding officer of the, regiment, Lieutenant-Colonel Thompson\r\nMorris, and by the captain of my company (\"D\"), Eugene E. McLean, and\r\nhis charming wife the only daughter of General E. V. Sumner, who was\r\nalready distinguished in our service, but much better known in after\r\nyears in the operations of the Army of the Potomac, during its early\r\ncampaigns in Virginia.  Shortly after joining company \"D\" I was sent\r\nout on scouting duty with another company of the regiment to Camp La\r\nPena, about sixty or seventy miles east of Fort Duncan, in a section\r\nof country that had for some time past been subjected to raids by the\r\nLipan and Comanche Indians.  Our outpost at La Pena was intended as a\r\nprotection against the predatory incursions of these savages, so\r\nalmost constant scouting became a daily occupation.  This enabled me\r\nsoon to become familiar with and make maps of the surrounding\r\ncountry, and, through constant association with our Mexican guide, to\r\npick up in a short time quite a smattering of the Spanish language,\r\nwhich was very useful to one serving on that frontier.\r\n\r\nAt that early day western Texas was literally filled with game, and\r\nthe region in the immediate vicinity of La Pena contained its full\r\nproportion of deer, antelope, and wild turkeys.  The temptation to\r\nhunt was therefore constantly before me, and a desire to indulge in\r\nthis pastime, whenever free from the legitimate duty of the camp,\r\nsoon took complete possession of me, so expeditions in pursuit of\r\ngame were of frequent occurrence.  In these expeditions I was always\r\naccompanied by a soldier named Frankman, belonging to \"D\" company,\r\nwho was a fine sportsman, and a butcher by trade.  In a short period\r\nI learned from Frankman how to approach and secure the different\r\nspecies of game, and also how to dress and care for it when killed.\r\nAlmost every expedition we made was rewarded with a good supply of\r\ndeer, antelope, and wild turkeys, and we furnished the command in\r\ncamp with such abundance that it was relieved from the necessity of\r\ndrawing its beef ration, much to the discomfiture of the disgruntled\r\nbeef contractor.\r\n\r\nThe camp at La Pena was on sandy ground, unpleasant for men and\r\nanimals, and by my advice it was moved to La Pendencia, not far from\r\nLake Espantosa.  Before removal from our old location, however, early\r\none bright morning Frankman and I started on one of our customary\r\nexpeditions, going down La Pena Creek to a small creek, at the head\r\nof which we had established a hunting rendezvous.  After proceeding\r\nalong the stream for three or four miles we saw a column of smoke on\r\nthe prairie, and supposing it arose from a camp of Mexican rancheros\r\ncatching wild horses or wild cattle, and even wild mules, which were\r\nvery numerous in that section of country along the Nueces River, we\r\nthought we would join the party and see how much success they were\r\nhaving, and observe the methods employed in this laborious and\r\nsometimes dangerous vocation.  With this object in view, we continued\r\non until we found it necessary to cross to the other side of the\r\ncreek to reach the point indicated by the smoke.  Just before\r\nreaching the crossing I discovered moccasin tracks near the water's\r\nedge, and realizing in an instant that the camp we were approaching\r\nmight possibly be one of hostile Indians--all Indians in that country\r\nat that time were hostile--Frankman and I backed out silently, and\r\nmade eager strides for La Pena, where we had scarcely arrived when\r\nCaptain M. E. Van Buren, of the Mounted Rifle regiment, came in with\r\na small command, and reported that he was out in pursuit of a band of\r\nComanche Indians, which had been committing depredations up about\r\nFort Clark, but that he had lost the trail.  I immediately informed\r\nhim of what had occurred to me during the morning, and that I could\r\nput him on the trail of the Indians he was desirous of punishing.\r\n\r\nWe hurriedly supplied with rations his small command of thirteen,\r\nmen, and I then conducted him to the point where I had seen the\r\nsmoke, and there we found signs indicating it to be the recently\r\nabandoned camp of the Indians he was pursuing, and we also noticed\r\nthat prairie rats had formed the principal article of diet at the\r\nmeal they had just completed.  As they had gone, I could do no more\r\nthan put him on the trail made in their departure, which was well\r\nmarked; for Indians, when in small parties, and unless pressed,\r\nusually follow each other in single file.  Captain Van Buren followed\r\nthe trail by Fort Ewell, and well down toward Corpus Christi, day and\r\nnight, until the Indians, exhausted and used up, halted, on an open\r\nplain, unsaddled their horses, mounted bareback, and offered battle.\r\nTheir number was double that of Van Buren's detachment, but he\r\nattacked them fearlessly, and in the fight was mortally wounded by an\r\narrow which entered his body in front, just above the sword belt, and\r\ncame through the belt behind.  The principal chief of the Indians was\r\nkilled, and the rest fled.  Captain Van Buren's men carried him to\r\nCorpus Christi, where in a few days he died.\r\n\r\nAfter our removal to La Pendencia a similar pursuit of savages\r\noccurred, but with more fortunate results.  Colonel John H. King, now\r\non the retired list, then a captain in the First Infantry, came to\r\nour camp in pursuit of a marauding band of hostile Indians, and I was\r\nenabled to put him also on the trail.  He soon overtook them, and\r\nkilling two without loss to himself, the band dispersed like a flock\r\nof quail and left him nothing to follow.  He returned to our camp\r\nshortly after, and the few friendly Indian scouts he had with him\r\nheld a grand pow-wow and dance over the scalps of the fallen braves.\r\n\r\nAround La Pendencia, as at La Pena, the country abounded in deer,\r\nantelope, wild turkeys, and quail, and we killed enough to supply\r\nabundantly the whole command with the meat portion of the ration.\r\nSome mornings Frankman and I would bring in as many as seven deer,\r\nand our hunting expeditions made me so familiar with the region\r\nbetween our camp and Fort Duncan, the headquarters of the regiment,\r\nthat I was soon enabled to suggest a more direct route of\r\ncommunication than the circuitous one then traversed, and in\r\na short time it was established.\r\n\r\nUp to this time I had been on detached duty, but soon my own company\r\nwas ordered into the field to occupy a position on Turkey Creek,\r\nabout ten or twelve miles west of the Nueces River, on the road from\r\nSan Antonio to Fort Duncan, and I was required to join the company.\r\nHere constant work and scouting were necessary, as our camp was\r\nspecially located with reference to protecting from Indian raids the\r\nroad running from San Antonio to Fort Duncan, and on to the interior\r\nof Mexico.  In those days this road was the great line of travel, and\r\nMexican caravans were frequently passing over it, to and fro, in such\r\na disorganized condition as often to invite attack from marauding\r\nComanches and Lipans.  Our time, therefore, was incessantly occupied\r\nin scouting, but our labors were much lightened because they were\r\ndirected with intelligence and justice by Captain McLean, whose\r\nagreeable manners and upright methods are still so impressed on my\r\nmemory that to this day I look back upon my service with \"D\" Company\r\nof the First Infantry as among those events which I remember with\r\nmost pleasure.\r\n\r\nIn this manner my first summer of active field duty passed rapidly\r\naway, and in the fall my company returned to Fort Duncan to go into\r\nwinter quarters.  These quarters, when constructed, consisted of \"A\"\r\ntents pitched under a shed improvised by the company.  With only\r\nthese accommodations I at first lived around as best I could until\r\nthe command was quartered, and then, requesting a detail of wagons\r\nfrom the quartermaster, I went out some thirty miles to get poles to\r\nbuild a more comfortable habitation for myself.  In a few days enough\r\npoles for the construction of a modest residence were secured and\r\nbrought in, and then the building of my house began.  First, the\r\npoles were cut the proper length, planted in a trench around four\r\nsides of a square of very small proportions, and secured at the top\r\nby string-pieces stretched from one angle to another, in which\r\nhalf-notches hack been made at proper intervals to receive the\r\nuprights.  The poles were then made rigid by strips nailed on\r\nhalf-way to the ground, giving the sides of the structure firmness,\r\nbut the interstices were large and frequent; still, with the aid of\r\nsome old condemned paulins obtained from the quartermaster, the walls\r\nwere covered and the necessity for chinking obviated.  This method of\r\ncovering the holes in the side walls also possessed the advantage of\r\npermitting some little light to penetrate to the interior of the\r\nhouse, and avoided the necessity of constructing a window, for which,\r\nby the way, no glass could have been obtained.  Next a good large\r\nfire-place and chimney were built in one corner by means of stones\r\nand mud, and then the roof was put on--a thatched one of prairie\r\ngrass.  The floor was dirt compactly tamped.\r\n\r\nMy furniture was very primitive: a chair or two, with about the same\r\nnumber of camp stools, a cot, and a rickety old bureau that I\r\nobtained in some way not now remembered.  My washstand consisted of a\r\nboard about three feet long, resting on legs formed by driving sticks\r\ninto the ground until they held it at about the proper height from\r\nthe floor.  This washstand was the most expensive piece of furniture\r\nI owned, the board having cost me three dollars, and even then I\r\nobtained it as a favor, for lumber on the Rio Grande was so scarce in\r\nthose days that to possess even the smallest quantity was to indulge\r\nin great luxury.  Indeed, about all that reached the post was what\r\ncame in the shape of bacon boxes, and the boards from these were\r\nreserved for coffins in which to bury our dead.\r\n\r\nIn this rude habitation I spent a happy winter, and was more\r\ncomfortably off than many of the officers, who had built none, but\r\nlived in tents and took the chances of \"Northers.\" During this period\r\nour food was principally the soldier's ration: flour, pickled pork,\r\nnasty bacon--cured in the dust of ground charcoal--and fresh beef, of\r\nwhich we had a plentiful supply, supplemented with game of various\r\nkinds.  The sugar, coffee, and smaller parts of the ration were good,\r\nbut we had no vegetables, and the few jars of preserves and some few\r\nvegetables kept by the sutler were too expensive to be indulged in.\r\nSo during all the period I lived at Fort Duncan and its sub-camps,\r\nnearly sixteen months, fresh vegetables were practically\r\nunobtainable.  To prevent scurvy we used the juice of the maguey\r\nplant, called pulque, and to obtain a supply of this anti-scorbutic I\r\nwas often detailed to march the company out about forty miles, cut\r\nthe plant, load up two or three wagons with the stalks, and carry\r\nthem to camp.  Here the juice was extracted by a rude press, and put\r\nin bottles until it fermented and became worse in odor than\r\nsulphureted hydrogen.  At reveille roll-call every morning this\r\nfermented liquor was dealt out to the company, and as it was my duty,\r\nin my capacity of subaltern, to attend these roll-calls and see that\r\nthe men took their ration of pulque, I always began the duty by\r\ndrinking a cup of the repulsive stuff myself.  Though hard to\r\nswallow, its well-known specific qualities in the prevention and cure\r\nof scurvy were familiar to all, so every man in the command gulped\r\ndown his share notwithstanding its vile taste and odor.\r\n\r\nConsidering our isolation, the winter passed very pleasantly to us\r\nall.  The post was a large one, its officers congenial, and we had\r\nmany enjoyable occasions.  Dances, races, and horseback riding filled\r\nin much of the time, and occasional raids from Indians furnished more\r\nserious occupation in the way of a scout now and then.  The proximity\r\nof the Indians at times rendered the surrounding country somewhat\r\ndangerous for individuals or small parties at a distance from the\r\nfort; but few thought the savages would come near, so many risks were\r\ndoubtless run by various officers, who carried the familiar\r\nsix-shooter as their only weapon while out horseback riding, until\r\nsuddenly we were awakened to the dangers we had been incurring.\r\n\r\nAbout mid-winter a party of hostile Lipans made a swoop around and\r\nskirting the garrison, killing a herder--a discharged drummer-boy--in\r\nsight of the flag-staff.  Of course great excitement followed.\r\nCaptain J. G. Walker, of the Mounted Rifles, immediately started with\r\nhis company in pursuit of the Indians, and I was directed to\r\naccompany the command.  Not far away we found the body of the boy\r\nfilled with arrows, and near him the body of a fine looking young\r\nIndian, whom the lad had undoubtedly killed before he was himself\r\noverpowered.  We were not a great distance behind the Indians when\r\nthe boy's body was discovered, and having good trailers we gained on\r\nthem rapidly, with the prospect of overhauling them, but as soon as\r\nthey found we were getting near they headed for the Rio Grande, made\r\nthe crossing to the opposite bank, and were in Mexico before we could\r\novertake them.  When on the other side of the boundary they grew very\r\nbrave, daring us to come over to fight them, well aware all the time\r\nthat the international line prevented us from continuing the pursuit.\r\nSo we had to return to the post without reward for our exertion\r\nexcept the consciousness of having made the best effort we could to\r\ncatch the murderers.  That night, in company with Lieutenant Thomas\r\nG. Williams, I crossed over the river to the Mexican village of\r\nPiedras Negras, and on going to a house where a large baille, or\r\ndance, was going on we found among those present two of the Indians\r\nwe had been chasing.  As soon as they saw us they strung their bows\r\nfor a fight, and we drew our six-shooters, but the Mexicans quickly\r\nclosed in around the Indians and forced them out of the house--or\r\nrude jackal--where the \"ball\" was being held, and they escaped.  We\r\nlearned later something about the nature of the fight the drummer had\r\nmade, and that his death had cost them dear, for, in addition to the\r\nIndian killed and lying by his side, he had mortally wounded another\r\nand seriously wounded a third, with the three shots that he had\r\nfired.\r\n\r\nAt this period I took up the notion of making a study of ornithology,\r\nincited to it possibly by the great number of bright-colored birds\r\nthat made their winter homes along the Rio Grande, and I spent many a\r\nleisure hour in catching specimens by means of stick traps, with\r\nwhich I found little difficulty in securing almost every variety of\r\nthe feathered tribes.  I made my traps by placing four sticks of a\r\nlength suited to the size desired so as to form a square, and\r\nbuilding up on them in log-cabin fashion until the structure came\r\nalmost to a point by contraction of the corners.  Then the sticks\r\nwere made secure, the trap placed at some secluded spot, and from the\r\ncentre to the outside a trench was dug in the ground, and thinly\r\ncovered when a depth had been obtained that would leave an aperture\r\nsufficiently large to admit the class of birds desired.  Along this\r\ntrench seeds and other food were scattered, which the birds soon\r\ndiscovered, and of course began to eat, unsuspectingly following the\r\ntempting bait through the gallery till they emerged from its farther\r\nend in the centre of the trap, where they contentedly fed till the\r\nfood was all gone.  Then the fact of imprisonment first presented\r\nitself, and they vainly endeavored to escape through the interstices\r\nof the cage, never once guided by their instinct to return to liberty\r\nthrough the route by which they had entered.\r\n\r\nAmong the different kinds of birds captured in this way,\r\nmocking-birds, blue-birds, robins, meadow larks, quail, and plover\r\nwere the most numerous.  They seemed to have more voracious appetites\r\nthan other varieties, or else they were more unwary, and consequently\r\nmore easily caught.  A change of station, however, put an end to my\r\nornithological plans, and activities of other kinds prevented me from\r\nresuming them in after life.\r\n\r\nThere were quite a number of young officers at the post during the\r\nwinter, and as our relations with the Mexican commandant at Piedras\r\nNegras were most amicable, we were often invited to dances at his\r\nhouse.  He and his hospitable wife and daughter drummed up the female\r\nportion of the elite of Piedras Negras and provided the house, which\r\nwas the official as well as the personal residence of the commandant,\r\nwhile we--the young officers--furnished the music and such\r\nsweetmeats, candies, &c., for the baille as the country would afford.\r\n\r\nWe generally danced in a long hall on a hard dirt floor.  The girls\r\nsat on one side of the hall, chaperoned by their mothers or some old\r\nduennas, and the men on the other.  When the music struck up each man\r\nasked the lady whom his eyes had already selected to dance with him,\r\nand it was not etiquette for her to refuse--no engagements being\r\nallowed before the music began.  When the dance, which was generally\r\na long waltz, was over, he seated his partner, and then went to a\r\nlittle counter at the end of the room and bought his dulcinea a plate\r\nof the candies and sweetmeats provided.  Sometimes she accepted them,\r\nbut most generally pointed to her duenna or chaperon behind, who held\r\nup her apron and caught the refreshments as they were slid into it\r\nfrom the plate.  The greatest decorum was maintained at these dances,\r\nprimitively as they were conducted; and in a region so completely cut\r\noff from the world, their influence was undoubtedly beneficial to a\r\nconsiderable degree in softening the rough edges in a half-breed\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of this frontier of Mexico were strongly marked with\r\nIndian characteristics, particularly with those of the Comanche type,\r\nand as the wild Indian blood predominated, few of the physical traits\r\nof the Spaniard remained among them, and outlawry was common.  The\r\nSpanish conquerors had left on the northern border only their\r\ngraceful manners and their humility before the cross.  The sign of\r\nChristianity was prominently placed at all important points on roads\r\nor trails, and especially where any one had been killed; and as the\r\nComanche Indians, strong and warlike, had devastated northeastern\r\nMexico in past years, all along the border, on both sides of the Rio\r\nGrande, the murderous effects of their raids were evidenced by\r\nnumberless crosses.  For more than a century forays had been made on\r\nthe settlements and towns by these bloodthirsty savages, and, the\r\nMexican Government being too weak to afford protection, property was\r\ndestroyed, the women and children carried off or ravished, and the\r\nmen compelled to look on in an agony of helplessness till relieved by\r\ndeath.  During all this time, however, the forms and ceremonials of\r\nreligion, and the polite manners received from the Spaniards, were\r\nretained, and reverence for the emblems of Christianity was always\r\nuppermost in the mind of even the most ignorant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nORDERED TO FORT READING, CAL.--A DANGEROUS UNDERTAKING--A RESCUED\r\nSOLDIER--DISCOVERING INDIANS--PRIMITIVE FISHING--A DESERTED\r\nVILLAGE--CAMPING OPPOSITE FORT VANCOUVER.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1854, I received my promotion to a second lieutenancy in\r\nthe Fourth Infantry, which was stationed in California and Oregon. In\r\norder to join my company at Fort Reading, California, I had to go to\r\nNew York as a starting point, and on arrival there, was placed on\r\nduty, in May, 1855, in command of a detachment of recruits at\r\nBedloe's Island, intended for assignment to the regiments on the\r\nPacific coast.  I think there were on the island (now occupied by the\r\nstatue of Liberty Enlightening the World) about three hundred\r\nrecruits.  For a time I was the only officer with them, but shortly\r\nbefore we started for California, Lieutenant Francis H. Bates, of the\r\nFourth Infantry, was placed in command. We embarked for the Pacific\r\ncoast in July, 1855, and made the journey without incident via the\r\nIsthmus of Panama, in due time landing our men at Benecia Barracks,\r\nabove San Francisco.\r\n\r\nFrom this point I proceeded to join my company at Fort Reading, and\r\non reaching that post, found orders directing me to relieve\r\nLieutenant John B. Hood--afterward well known as a distinguished\r\ngeneral in the Confederate service.  Lieutenant Hood was in command\r\nof the personal mounted escort of Lieutenant R. S. Williamson, who\r\nwas charged with the duty of making such explorations and surveys as\r\nwould determine the practicability of connecting, by railroad, the\r\nSacramento Valley in California with the Columbia River in Oregon\r\nTerritory, either through the Willamette Valley, or (if this route\r\nshould prove to be impracticable) by the valley of the Des Chutes\r\nRiver near the foot-slopes of the Cascade chain.  The survey was\r\nbeing made in accordance with an act of Congress, which provided both\r\nfor ascertaining the must practicable and economical route for a\r\nrailroad between the Mississippi River and the Pacific Ocean, and for\r\nmilitary and geographical surveys west of the Mississippi River.\r\n\r\nFort Reading was the starting-point for this exploring expedition,\r\nand there I arrived some four or five days after the party under\r\nLieutenant Williamson had begun its march.  His personal escort\r\nnumbered about sixty mounted men, made up of detachments from\r\ncompanies of the First Dragoons, under command of Lieutenant Hood,\r\ntogether with about one hundred men belonging to the Fourth Infantry\r\nand Third Artillery, commanded by Lieutenant Horatio Gates Gibson,\r\nthe present colonel of the Third United States Artillery.  Lieutenant\r\nGeorge Crook--now major-general--was the quartermaster and commissary\r\nof subsistence of the expedition.\r\n\r\nThe commanding officer at Fort Reading seemed reluctant to let me go\r\non to relieve Lieutenant Hood, as the country to be passed over was\r\ninfested by the Pit River Indians, known to be hostile to white\r\npeople and especially to small parties.  I was very anxious to\r\nproceed, however, and willing to take the chances; so, consent being\r\nfinally obtained, I started with a corporal and two mounted men,\r\nthrough a wild and uninhabited region, to overtake if possible\r\nLieutenant Williamson.  Being on horseback, and unencumbered by\r\nluggage of any kind except blankets and a little hard bread, coffee\r\nand smoking-tobacco, which were all carried on our riding animals, we\r\nwere sanguine of succeeding, for we traversed in one day fully the\r\ndistance made in three by Lieutenant Williamson's party on foot.\r\n\r\nThe first day we reached the base of Lassan's Butte, where I\r\ndetermined to spend the night near an isolated cabin, or dugout, that\r\nhad been recently constructed by a hardy pioneer.  The wind was\r\nblowing a disagreeable gale, which had begun early in the day.  This\r\nmade it desirable to locate our camp under the best cover we could\r\nfind, and I spent some little time in looking about for a\r\nsatisfactory place, but nothing better offered than a large fallen\r\ntree, which lay in such a direction that by encamping on its lee side\r\nwe would be protected from the fury of the storm.  This spot was\r\ntherefore fixed upon, and preparation made for spending the night as\r\ncomfortably as the circumstances would permit.\r\n\r\nAfter we had unsaddled I visited the cabin to inquire in regard to\r\nthe country ahead, and there found at first only a soldier of\r\nWilliamson's party; later the proprietor of the ranch appeared.  The\r\nsoldier had been left behind by the surveying party on account of\r\nillness, with instructions to make his way back to Fort Reading as\r\nbest he could when he recovered.  His condition having greatly\r\nimproved, however, since he had been left, he now begged me in\r\nbeseeching terms to take him along with my party, which I finally\r\nconsented to do, provided that if he became unable to keep up with\r\nme, and I should be obliged to abandon him, the responsibility would\r\nbe his, not mine.  This increased my number to five, and was quite a\r\nreinforcement should we run across any hostile Indians; but it was\r\nalso certain to prove an embarrassment should the man again fall ill.\r\n\r\nDuring the night, notwithstanding the continuance of the storm, I had\r\na very sound and refreshing sleep behind the protecting log where we\r\nmade our camp, and at daylight next morning we resumed our journey,\r\nfortified by a breakfast of coffee and hard bread.  I skirted around\r\nthe base of Lassan's Butte, thence down Hat Creek, all the time\r\nfollowing the trail made by Lieutenant Williamson's party.  About\r\nnoon the soldier I had picked up at my first camp gave out, and could\r\ngo no farther.  As stipulated when I consented to take him along, I\r\nhad the right to abandon him, but when it came to the test I could\r\nnot make up my mind to do it.  Finding a good place not far off the\r\ntrail, one of my men volunteered to remain with him until he died;\r\nand we left them there, with a liberal supply of hard bread and\r\ncoffee, believing that we would never again see the invalid.  My\r\nreinforcement was already gone, and another man with it.\r\n\r\nWith my diminished party I resumed the trail and followed it until\r\nabout 4 o'clock in the afternoon, when we heard the sound of voices,\r\nand the corporal, thinking we were approaching Lieutenant\r\nWilliamson's party, was so overjoyed in anticipation of the junction,\r\nthat he wanted to fire his musket as an expression of his delight.\r\nThis I prevented his doing, however, and we continued cautiously and\r\nslowly on to develop the source of the sounds in front.  We had not\r\ngone far before I discovered that the noise came from a band of Pit\r\nRiver Indians, who had struck the trail of the surveying expedition,\r\nand were following it up, doubtless with evil intent.  Dismounting\r\nfrom my horse I counted the moccasin tracks to ascertain the number\r\nof Indians, discovered it to be about thirty, and then followed on\r\nbehind them cautiously, but with little difficulty, as appearances of\r\nspeed on their part indicated that they wished to overtake Lieutenant\r\nWilliamson's party, which made them less on the lookout than usual\r\nfor any possible pursuers.  After following the trail until nearly\r\nsundown, I considered it prudent to stop for the night, and drew off\r\nsome little distance, where, concealed in a dense growth of timber,\r\nwe made our camp.\r\n\r\nAs I had with me now only two men, I felt somewhat nervous, so I\r\nallowed no fires to be built, and in consequence our supper consisted\r\nof hard bread only.  I passed an anxious night, but beyond our own\r\nsolicitude there was nothing to disturb us, the Indians being too\r\nmuch interested in overtaking the party in front to seek for victims\r\nin the rear, After a hard-bread breakfast we started again on the\r\ntrail, and had proceeded but a short distance when, hearing the\r\nvoices of the Indians, we at once slackened our speed so as not to\r\novertake them.\r\n\r\nMost of the trail on which we traveled during the morning ran over an\r\nexceedingly rough lava formation--a spur of the lava beds often\r\ndescribed during the Modoc war of 1873 so hard and flinty that\r\nWilliamson's large command made little impression on its surface,\r\nleaving in fact, only indistinct traces of its line of march.  By\r\ncare and frequent examinations we managed to follow his route through\r\nwithout much delay, or discovery by the Indians, and about noon,\r\nowing to the termination of the lava formation, we descended into the\r\nvalley of Hat Greek, a little below where it emerges from the second\r\ncanon and above its confluence with Pit River.  As soon as we reached\r\nthe fertile soil of the valley, we found Williamson's trail well\r\ndefined, deeply impressed in the soft loam, and coursing through\r\nwild-flowers and luxuriant grass which carpeted the ground on every\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nWhen we struck this delightful locality we traveled with considerable\r\nspeed, and after passing over hill and vale for some distance, the\r\ntrail becoming more and more distinct all the time, I suddenly saw in\r\nfront of me the Pit River Indians.\r\n\r\nThis caused a halt, and having hurriedly re-capped our guns and\r\nsix-shooters, thus preparing for the worst, I took a look at the band\r\nthrough my field-glass.  They were a half-mile or more in our front\r\nand numbered about thirty individuals, armed with bows and arrows\r\nonly.  Observing us they made friendly demonstrations, but I had not\r\nimplicit faith in a Pit River Indian at that period of the settlement\r\nof our country, and especially in that wild locality, so after a\r\n\"council of war\" with the corporal and man, I concluded to advance to\r\na point about two hundred yards distant from the party, when, relying\r\non the speed of our horses rather than on the peaceable intentions of\r\nthe savages, I hoped to succeed in cutting around them and take the\r\ntrail beyond.  Being on foot they could not readily catch us, and\r\ninasmuch as their arrows were good for a range of only about sixty\r\nyards, I had no fear of any material damage on that score.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the place selected for our flank movement we made a dash\r\nto the left of the trail, through the widest part of the valley, and\r\nran our horses swiftly by, but I noticed that the Indians did not\r\nseem to be disturbed by the manoeuvre and soon realized that this\r\nindifference was occasioned by the knowledge that we could not cross\r\nHat Creek, a deep stream with vertical banks, too broad to be leaped\r\nby our horses.  We were obliged, therefore, to halt, and the Indians\r\nagain made demonstrations of friendship, some of them even getting\r\ninto the stream to show that they were at the ford.  Thus reassured,\r\nwe regained our confidence and boldly crossed the river in the midst\r\nof them.  After we had gained the bluff on the other side of the\r\ncreek, I looked down into the valley of Pit River, and could plainly\r\nsee the camp of the surveying party.  Its proximity was the influence\r\nwhich had doubtless caused the peaceable conduct of the Indians.\r\nProbably the only thing that saved us was their ignorance of our\r\nbeing in their rear, until we stumbled on them almost within sight of\r\nthe large party under Williamson.\r\n\r\nThe Pit River Indians were very hostile at that time, and for many\r\nsucceeding years their treachery and cruelty brought misfortune and\r\nmisery to the white settlers who ventured their lives in search of\r\nhome and fortune in the wild and isolated section over which these\r\nsavages roamed.  Not long after Williamson's party passed through\r\ntheir country, the Government was compelled to send into it a\r\nconsiderable force for the purpose of keeping them under control.\r\nThe outcome of this was a severe fight--resulting in the loss of a\r\ngood many lives--between the hostiles and a party of our troops under\r\nLieutenant George Crook.  It finally ended in the establishment of a\r\nmilitary post in the vicinity of the battle-ground, for the permanent\r\noccupation of the country.\r\n\r\nA great load was lifted from my heart when I found myself so near\r\nWilliamson's camp, which I joined August 4, 1855, receiving a warm\r\nwelcome from the officers.  During the afternoon I relieved\r\nLieutenant Hood of the command of the personal escort, and he was\r\nordered to return, with twelve of the mounted men, over the trail I\r\nhad followed.  I pointed out to him on the map the spot where he\r\nwould find the two men left on the roadside, and he was directed to\r\ntake them into Fort Reading.  They were found without difficulty, and\r\ncarried in to the post.  The sick man--Duryea--whom I had expected\r\nnever to see again, afterward became the hospital steward at Fort\r\nYamhill, Oregon, when I was stationed there.\r\n\r\nThe Indians that I had passed at the ford came to the bluff above the\r\ncamp, and arranging themselves in a squatting posture, looked down\r\nupon Williamson's party with longing eyes, in expectation of a feast.\r\nThey were a pitiable lot, almost naked, hungry and cadaverous.\r\nIndians are always hungry, but these poor creatures were particularly\r\nso, as their usual supply of food had grown very scarce from one\r\ncause and another.\r\n\r\nIn prosperity they mainly subsisted on fish, or game killed with the\r\nbow and arrow.  When these sources failed they lived on grasshoppers,\r\nand at this season the grasshopper was their principal food.  In\r\nformer years salmon were very abundant in the streams of the\r\nSacramento Valley, and every fall they took great quantities of these\r\nfish and dried them for winter use, but alluvial mining had of late\r\nyears defiled the water of the different streams and driven the fish\r\nout.  On this account the usual supply of salmon was very limited.\r\nThey got some trout high up on the rivers, above the sluices and\r\nrockers of the miners, but this was a precarious source from which to\r\nderive food, as their means of taking the trout were very primitive.\r\nThey had neither hooks nor lines, but depended entirely on a\r\ncontrivance made from long, slender branches of willow, which grew on\r\nthe banks of most of the streams.  One of these branches would be\r\ncut, and after sharpening the butt-end to a point, split a certain\r\ndistance, and by a wedge the prongs divided sufficiently to admit a\r\nfish between.  The Indian fisherman would then slyly put the forked\r\nend in the water over his intended victim, and with a quick dart\r\nfirmly wedge him between the prongs.  When secured there, the work of\r\nlanding him took but a moment.  When trout were plentiful this\r\nprimitive mode of taking them was quite successful, and I have often\r\nknown hundreds of pounds to be caught in this way, but when they were\r\nscarce and suspicious the rude method was not rewarded with good\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThe band looking down on us evidently had not had much fish or game\r\nto eat for some time, so when they had made Williamson understand\r\nthat they were suffering for food he permitted them to come into\r\ncamp, and furnished them with a supply, which they greedily swallowed\r\nas fast as it was placed at their service, regardless of possible\r\nindigestion.  When they had eaten all they could hold, their\r\nenjoyment was made complete by the soldiers, who gave them a quantity\r\nof strong plug tobacco.  This they smoked incessantly, inhaling all\r\nthe smoke, so that none of the effect should be lost.  When we\r\nabandoned this camp the next day, the miserable wretches remained in\r\nit and collected the offal about the cooks' fires to feast still\r\nmore, piecing out the meal, no doubt, with their staple article of\r\nfood--grasshoppers.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of August 5 Lieutenant Hood started back to Fort\r\nReading, and Lieutenant Williamson resumed his march for the Columbia\r\nRiver.  Our course was up Pit River, by the lower and upper canons,\r\nthen across to the Klamath Lakes, then east, along their edge to the\r\nupper lake.  At the middle Klamath Lake, just after crossing Lost\r\nRiver and the Natural Bridge, we met a small party of citizens from\r\nJacksonville, Oregon, looking for hostile Indians who had committed\r\nsome depredations in their neighborhood.  From them we learned that\r\nthe Rogue River Indians in southern Oregon were on the war-path, and\r\nthat as the \"regular troops up there were of no account, the citizens\r\nhad taken matters in hand, and intended cleaning up the hostiles.\"\r\nThey swaggered about our camp, bragged a good deal, cursed the\r\nIndians loudly, and soundly abused the Government for not giving them\r\nbetter protection.  It struck me, however, that they had not worked\r\nvery hard to find the hostiles; indeed, it could plainly be seen that\r\ntheir expedition was a town-meeting sort of affair, and that anxiety\r\nto get safe home was uppermost in their thoughts.  The enthusiasm\r\nwith which they started had all oozed out, and that night they\r\nmarched back to Jacksonville.  The next day, at the head of the lake,\r\nwe came across an Indian village, and I have often wondered since\r\nwhat would have been the course pursued by these valiant warriors\r\nfrom Jacksonville had they gone far enough to get into its vicinity.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the village the tepees--made of grass--were all\r\nstanding, the fires burning and pots boiling--the pots filled with\r\ncamas and tula roots--but not an Indian was to be seen.  Williamson\r\ndirected that nothing in the village should be disturbed; so guards\r\nwere placed over it to carry out his instructions and we went into\r\ncamp just a little beyond.  We had scarcely established ourselves\r\nwhen a very old Indian rose up from the high grass some distance off,\r\nand with peaceable signs approached our camp, evidently for the\r\npurpose of learning whether or not our intentions were hostile.\r\nWilliamson told him we were friendly; that we had passed through his\r\nvillage without molesting it, that we had put a guard there to secure\r\nthe property his people had abandoned in their fright, and that they\r\nmight come back in safety.  The old man searchingly eyed everything\r\naround for some little time, and gaining confidence from the\r\npeaceable appearance of the men, who were engaged in putting up the\r\ntents and preparing their evening meal, he concluded to accept our\r\nprofessions of friendship, and bring his people in.  Going out about\r\nhalf a mile from the village he gave a peculiar yell, at which\r\nbetween three and four hundred Indians arose simultaneously from the\r\nground, and in answer to his signal came out of the tall grass like a\r\nswarm of locusts and soon overran our camp in search of food, for\r\nlike all Indians they were hungry.  They too, proved to be Pit\r\nRivers, and were not less repulsive than those of their tribe we had\r\nmet before.  They were aware of the hostilities going on between the\r\nRogue Rivers and the whites, but claimed that they had not taken any\r\npart in them.  I question if they had, but had our party been small,\r\nI fear we should have been received at their village in a very\r\ndifferent manner.\r\n\r\nFrom the upper Klamath Lake we marched over the divide and down the\r\nvalley of the Des Chutes River to a point opposite the mountains\r\ncalled the Three Sisters.  Here, on September 23, the party divided,\r\nWilliamson and I crossing through the crater of the Three Sisters and\r\nalong the western slope of the Cascade Range, until we struck the\r\ntrail on McKenzie River, which led us into the Willamette Valley not\r\nfar from Eugene City.  We then marched down the Willamette Valley to\r\nPortland, Oregon, where we arrived October 9, 1855\r\n\r\nThe infantry portion of the command, escorting Lieutenant Henry L.\r\nAbbot, followed farther down the Des Chutes River, to a point\r\nopposite Mount Hood, from which it came into the Willamette Valley\r\nand then marched to Portland.  At Portland we all united, and moving\r\nacross the point between the Willamette and Columbia rivers, encamped\r\nopposite Fort Vancouver, on the south bank of the latter stream, on\r\nthe farm of an old settler named Switzler, who had located there many\r\nyears before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\"OLD RED\"--SKILLFUL SHOOTING--YAKIMA--WAR--A LUDICROUS\r\nMISTAKE--\"CUT-MOUTH JOHN'S\" ENCOUNTER--FATHER PANDOZA'S\r\nMISSION--A SNOW-STORM--FAILURE OF THE EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\nOur camp on the Columbia, near Fort Vancouver, was beautifully\r\nsituated on a grassy sward close to the great river; and--as little\r\nduty was required of us after so long a journey, amusement of one\r\nkind or another, and an interchange of visits with the officers at\r\nthe post, filled in the time acceptably.  We had in camp an old\r\nmountaineer guide who had accompanied us on the recent march, and who\r\nhad received the sobriquet of \"Old Red,\" on account of the shocky and\r\ntangled mass of red hair and beard, which covered his head and face\r\nso completely that only his eyes could be seen.  His eccentricities\r\nconstantly supplied us with a variety of amusements.  Among the\r\npastimes he indulged in was one which exhibited his skill with the\r\nrifle, and at the same time protected the camp from the intrusions\r\nand ravages of a drove of razor-backed hogs which belonged to Mr.\r\nSwitzler.  These hogs were frequent visitors, and very destructive to\r\nour grassy sward, rooting it up in front of our tents and all about\r\nus; in pursuit of bulbous roots and offal from the camp.  Old Red\r\nconceived the idea that it would be well to disable the pigs by\r\nshooting off the tips of their snouts, and he proceeded to put his\r\nconception into execution, and continued it daily whenever the hogs\r\nmade their appearance.  Of course their owner made a row about it;\r\nbut when Old Red daily settled for his fun by paying liberally with\r\ngold-dust from some small bottles of the precious metal in his\r\npossession, Switzler readily became contented, and I think even\r\nencouraged the exhibitions--of skill.\r\n\r\nIt was at this period (October, 1855) that the Yakima Indian war\r\nbroke out, and I was detached from duty with the exploring party and\r\nrequired by Major Gabriel J. Rains, then commanding the district, to\r\njoin an expedition against the Yakimas.  They had some time before\r\nkilled their agent, and in consequence a force under Major Granville\r\nO. Haller had been sent out from the Dalles of the Columbia to\r\nchastise them; but the expedition had not been successful; in fact,\r\nit had been driven back, losing a number of men and two mountain\r\nhowitzers.\r\n\r\nThe object of the second expedition was to retrieve this disaster.\r\nThe force was composed of a small body of regular troops, and a\r\nregiment of Oregon mounted volunteers under command of Colonel James\r\nW. Nesmith--subsequently for several years United States Senator from\r\nOregon.  The whole force was under the command of Major Rains, Fourth\r\nInfantry, who, in order that he might rank Nesmith, by some\r\nhocus-pocus had been made a brigadier-general, under an appointment\r\nfrom the Governor of Washington Territory.\r\n\r\nWe started from the Dalles October 30, under conditions that were not\r\nconducive to success.  The season was late for operations; and worse\r\nstill, the command was not in accord with the commanding officer,\r\nbecause of general belief in his incompetency, and on account of the\r\nfictitious rank he assumed.  On the second day out I struck a small\r\nbody of Indians with my detachment of dragoons, but was unable to do\r\nthem any particular injury beyond getting possession of a large\r\nquantity of their winter food, which their hurried departure\r\ncompelled them to abandon.  This food consisted principally of dried\r\nsalmon-pulverized and packed in sacks made of grass-dried\r\nhuckleberries, and dried camas; the latter a bulbous root about the\r\nsize of a small onion, which, when roasted and ground, is made into\r\nbread by the Indians and has a taste somewhat like cooked chestnuts.\r\n\r\nOur objective point was Father Pandoza's Mission, in the Yakima\r\nValley, which could be reached by two different routes, and though\r\ncelerity of movement was essential, our commanding officer\r\n\"strategically\" adopted the longer route, and thus the Indians had\r\nample opportunity to get away with their horses, cattle, women and\r\nchildren, and camp property.\r\n\r\nAfter the encounter which I just now referred to, the command, which\r\nhad halted to learn the results of my chase, resumed its march to and\r\nthrough the Klikitat canon, and into the lower Yakima Valley, in the\r\ndirection of the Yakima River.  I had charge at the head of the\r\ncolumn as it passed through the canon, and on entering the valley\r\nbeyond, saw in the distance five or six Indian scouts, whom I pressed\r\nvery closely, until after a run of several miles they escaped across\r\nthe Yakima River.\r\n\r\nThe soil in the valley was light and dry, and the movement of animals\r\nover it raised great clouds of dust, that rendered it very difficult\r\nto distinguish friend from foe; and as I was now separated from the\r\nmain column a considerable distance, I deemed it prudent to call a\r\nhalt until we could discover the direction taken by the principal\r\nbody of the Indians.  We soon learned that they had gone up the\r\nvalley, and looking that way, we discovered a column of alkali dust\r\napproaching us, about a mile distant, interposing between my little\r\ndetachment and the point where I knew General Rains intended to\r\nencamp for the night.  After hastily consulting with Lieutenant\r\nEdward H. Day, of the Third United States Artillery, who was with me,\r\nwe both concluded that the dust was caused by a body of the enemy\r\nwhich had slipped in between us and our main force.  There seemed no\r\nalternative left us but to get back to our friends by charging\r\nthrough these Indians; and as their cloud of dust was much larger\r\nthan ours, this appeared a desperate chance.  Preparations to charge\r\nwere begun, however, but, much to our surprise, before they were\r\ncompleted the approaching party halted for a moment and then\r\ncommenced to retreat.  This calmed the throbbing of our hearts, and\r\nwith a wild cheer we started in a hot pursuit, that continued for\r\nabout two miles, when to our great relief we discovered that we were\r\ndriving into Rains's camp a squadron of Nesmith's battalion of Oregon\r\nvolunteers that we had mistaken for Indians, and who in turn believed\r\nus to be the enemy.  When camp was reached, we all indulged in a\r\nhearty laugh over the affair, and at the fright each party had given\r\nthe other.  The explanations which ensued proved that the squadron of\r\nvolunteers had separated from the column at the same time that I had\r\nwhen we debouched from the canon, and had pursued an intermediate\r\ntrail through the hills, which brought it into the valley of the\r\nYakima at a point higher up the river than where I had struck it.\r\n\r\nNext day we resumed our march up the valley, parallel to the Yakima.\r\nAbout 1 o'clock we saw a large body of Indians on the opposite side\r\nof the river, and the general commanding made up his mind to cross\r\nand attack them.  The stream was cold, deep, and swift, still I\r\nsucceeded in passing my dragoons over safely, but had hardly got them\r\nwell on the opposite bank when the Indians swooped down upon us.\r\nDismounting my men, we received the savages with a heavy fire, which\r\nbrought them to a halt with some damage and more or less confusion.\r\n\r\nGeneral Rains now became very much excited and alarmed about me, and\r\nendeavored to ford the swift river with his infantry and artillery,\r\nbut soon had to abandon the attempt, as three or four of the poor\r\nfellows were swept off their feet and drowned.  Meantime Nesmith came\r\nup with his mounted force, crossed over, and joined me.\r\n\r\nThe Indians now fell back to a high ridge, on the crest of which they\r\nmarched and countermarched, threatening to charge down its face.\r\nMost of them were naked, and as their persons were painted in gaudy\r\ncolors and decorated with strips of red flannel, red blankets and gay\r\nwar-bonnets, their appearance presented a scene of picturesque\r\nbarbarism, fascinating but repulsive.  As they numbered about six\r\nhundred, the chances of whipping them did not seem overwhelmingly in\r\nour favor, yet Nesmith and I concluded we would give them a little\r\nfight, provided we could engage them without going beyond the ridge.\r\nBut all our efforts were in vain, for as we advanced they retreated,\r\nand as we drew back they reappeared and renewed their parade and\r\nnoisy demonstrations, all the time beating their drums and yelling\r\nlustily.  They could not be tempted into a fight where we desired it,\r\nhowever, and as we felt unequal to any pursuit beyond the ridge\r\nwithout the assistance of the infantry and artillery, we re-crossed\r\nthe river and encamped with Rains.  It soon became apparent that the\r\nnoisy demonstrations of the Indians were intended only as a blind to\r\ncover the escape of their women and children to a place of safety in\r\nthe mountains.\r\n\r\nNext morning we took up our march without crossing the river; and as\r\nour route would lead us by the point on the opposite bank where the\r\nIndians had made their picturesque display the day before, they at an\r\nearly hour came over to our side, and rapidly moved ahead of us to\r\nsome distant hills, leaving in our pathway some of the more\r\nventuresome young braves, who attempted, to retard our advance by\r\nopening fire at long range from favorable places where they lay\r\nconcealed.  This fire did us little harm, but it had the effect of\r\nmaking our progress so slow that the patience of every one but\r\nGeneral Rains was well-nigh exhausted.\r\n\r\nAbout 2 o'clock in the afternoon we arrived well up near the base of\r\nthe range of hills, and though it was growing late we still had time\r\nto accomplish something, but our commanding officer decided that it\r\nwas best to go into camp, and make a systematic attack next morning.\r\nI proposed that he let me charge with my dragoons through the narrow\r\ncanon where the river broke through the range, while the infantry\r\nshould charge up the hill and drive the enemy from the top down on\r\nthe other side.  In this way I thought we might possibly catch some\r\nof the fugitives, but his extreme caution led him to refuse the\r\nsuggestion, so we pitched our tents out of range of their desultory\r\nfire, but near enough to observe plainly their menacing and\r\ntantalizing exhibitions of contempt.\r\n\r\nIn addition to firing occasionally, they called us all sorts of bad\r\nnames, made indecent gestures, and aggravated us, so that between 3\r\nand 4 o'clock in the afternoon, by an inexplicable concert of action,\r\nand with a serious breach of discipline, a large number of the men\r\nand many of the officers broke en masse from the camp with loud yells\r\nand charged the offending savages.  As soon as this mob got within\r\nmusket-shot they opened fire on the Indians, who ran down the other\r\nface of the ridge without making the slightest resistance.  The hill\r\nwas readily taken by this unmilitary proceeding, and no one was hurt\r\non either side, but as Rains would not permit it to be held, a large\r\nbonfire was lighted on the crest in celebration of the victory, and\r\nthen all hands marched back to camp, where they had no sooner arrived\r\nand got settled down than the Indians returned to the summit of the\r\nridge, seemingly to enjoy the fire that had been so generously built\r\nfor their benefit, and with renewed taunts and gestures continued to\r\ninsult us.\r\n\r\nOur camp that night was strongly picketed, and when we awoke in the\r\nmorning the Indians still occupied their position on the hill.  At\r\ndaylight we advanced against them, two or three companies of infantry\r\nmoving forward to drive them from the summit, while our main column\r\npassed through the canon into the upper Yakima Valley led by my\r\ndragoons, who were not allowed to charge into the gorge, as the\r\ncelerity of such a movement might cause the tactical combination to\r\nfail.\r\n\r\nAs we passed slowly and cautiously through the canon the Indians ran\r\nrapidly away, and when we reached the farther end they had entirely\r\ndisappeared from our front, except one old fellow, whose lame horse\r\nprevented him keeping up with the main body.  This presented an\r\nopportunity for gaining results which all thought should not be lost,\r\nso our guide, an Indian named \"Cut-mouth John,\" seized upon it, and\r\ngiving hot chase, soon, overtook the poor creature, whom he speedily\r\nkilled without much danger to himself, for the fugitive was armed\r\nwith only an old Hudson's Bay flint-lock horse-pistol which could not\r\nbe discharged.\r\n\r\n\"Cut-mouth John's\" engagement began and ended all the fighting that\r\ntook place on this occasion, and much disappointment and discontent\r\nfollowed, Nesmith's mounted force and my dragoons being particularly\r\ndisgusted because they had not been \"given a chance.\"  During the\r\nremainder of the day we cautiously followed the retreating foe, and\r\nlate in the evening went into camp a short distance from Father\r\nPandoza's Mission; where we were to await a small column of troops\r\nunder command of Captain Maurice Maloney, of the Fourth Infantry,\r\nthat was to join us from Steilicom by way of the Natchez Pass, and\r\nfrom which no tidings had as yet been received.\r\n\r\nNext morning the first thing I saw when I put my head out from my\r\nblankets was \"Cut-mouth John,\" already mounted and parading himself\r\nthrough the camp.  The scalp of the Indian he had despatched the day\r\nbefore was tied to the cross-bar of his bridle bit, the hair dangling\r\nalmost to the ground, and John was decked out in the sacred vestments\r\nof Father Pandoza, having, long before any one was stirring in camp,\r\nransacked the log-cabin at the Mission in which the good man had\r\nlived.  John was at all times a most repulsive looking individual, a\r\npart of his mouth having been shot away in a fight with Indians near\r\nWalla Walla some years before, in which a Methodist missionary had\r\nbeen killed; but his revolting personal appearance was now worse than\r\never, and the sacrilegious use of Father Pandoza's vestments, coupled\r\nwith the ghastly scalp that hung from his bridle, so turned opinion\r\nagainst him that he was soon captured, dismounted, and his parade\r\nbrought to an abrupt close, and I doubt whether he ever after quite\r\nreinstated himself in the good graces of the command.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the day nearly all the men visited the Mission, but\r\nas it had been plundered by the Indians at the outbreak of\r\nhostilities, when Father Pandoza was carried off, little of value was\r\nleft about it except a considerable herd of pigs, which the father\r\nwith great difficulty had succeeded in accumulating from a very small\r\nbeginning.  The pigs had not been disturbed by the Indians, but the\r\nstraggling troops soon disposed of them, and then turned their\r\nattention to the cabbages and potatoes in the garden, with the\r\nintention, no doubt, of dining that day on fresh pork and fresh\r\nvegetables instead of on salt junk and hard bread, which formed their\r\nregular diet on the march.  In digging up the potatoes some one\r\ndiscovered half a keg of powder, which had been buried in the garden\r\nby the good father to prevent the hostile Indians from getting it to\r\nuse against the whites.  As soon as this was unearthed wild\r\nexcitement ensued, and a cry arose that Father Pandoza was the person\r\nwho furnished powder to the Indians; that here was the proof; that at\r\nlast the mysterious means by which the Indians obtained ammunition\r\nwas explained--and a rush was made for the mission building. This was\r\na comfortable log-house of good size, built by the Indians for a\r\nschool and church, and attached to one end was the log-cabin\r\nresidence of the priest.  Its destruction was a matter of but a few\r\nmoments.  A large heap of dry wood was quickly collected and piled in\r\nthe building, matches applied, and the whole Mission, including the\r\npriest's house, was soon enveloped in flames, and burned to the\r\nground before the officers in camp became aware of the disgraceful\r\nplundering in which their men were engaged.\r\n\r\nThe commanding officer having received no news from Captain Maloney\r\nduring the day, Colonel Nesmith and I were ordered to go to his\r\nrescue, as it was concluded that he had been surrounded by Indians in\r\nthe Natchez Pass.  We started early the next morning, the snow\r\nfalling slightly as we set out, and soon arrived at the eastern mouth\r\nof the Natchez Pass.  On the way we noticed an abandoned Indian\r\nvillage, which had evidently not been occupied for some time.  As we\r\nproceeded the storm increased, and the snow-fall became deeper and\r\ndeeper, until finally our horses could not travel through it.  In\r\nconsequence we were compelled to give up further efforts to advance,\r\nand obliged to turn back to the abandoned village, where we encamped\r\nfor the night.  Near night-fall the storm greatly increased, and our\r\nbivouac became most uncomfortable; but spreading my blankets on the\r\nsnow and covering them with Indian matting, I turned in and slept\r\nwith that soundness and refreshment accorded by nature to one\r\nexhausted by fatigue.  When I awoke in the morning I found myself\r\nunder about two feet of snow, from which I arose with difficulty, yet\r\ngrateful that it had kept me warm during the night.\r\n\r\nAfter a cup of coffee and a little hard bread, it was decided we\r\nshould return to the main camp near the Mission, for we were now\r\nconfident that Maloney was delayed by the snow, and safe enough on\r\nthe other side of the mountains.  At all events he was beyond aid\r\nfrom us, for the impassable snowdrifts could not be overcome with the\r\nmeans in our possession.  It turned out that our suppositions as to\r\nthe cause of his delay were correct.  He had met with the same\r\ndifficulties that confronted us, and had been compelled to go into\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile valuable time had been lost, and the Indians, with their\r\nfamilies and stock, were well on their way to the Okenagan country, a\r\nregion into which we could not penetrate in the winter season.  No\r\nother course was therefore left but to complete the dismal failure of\r\nthe expedition by returning home, and our commander readily gave the\r\norder to march back to the Dalles by the \"short\" route over the\r\nYakima Mountains.\r\n\r\nAs the storm was still unabated, it was evident our march home would\r\nbe a most difficult one, and it was deemed advisable to start back at\r\nonce, lest we should be blocked up in the mountains by the snows for\r\na period beyond which our provisions would not last.  Relying on the\r\nfact that the short route to the Dalles would lead us over the range\r\nat its most depressed point, where it was hoped the depth of snow was\r\nnot yet so great as to make the route impassable, we started with\r\nColonel Nesmith's battalion in advance to break the road, followed by\r\nmy dragoons.  In the valley we made rapid progress, but when we\r\nreached the mountain every step we took up its side showed the snow\r\nto be growing deeper and deeper.  At last Nesmith reached the summit,\r\nand there found a depth of about six feet of snow covering the\r\nplateau in every direction, concealing all signs of the trail so\r\nthoroughly that his guides became bewildered and took the wrong\r\ndivide.  The moment I arrived at the top my guide--Donald Mc Kay--who\r\nknew perfectly the whole Yakima range, discovered Nesmith's mistake.\r\nWord was sent to bring him back, but as he had already nearly crossed\r\nthe plateau, considerable delay occurred before he returned.  When he\r\narrived we began anew the work of breaking a road for the foot troops\r\nbehind us, my detachment now in advance.  The deep snow made our work\r\nextremely laborious, exhausting men and horses almost to the point of\r\nrelinquishing the struggle, but our desperate situation required that\r\nwe should get down into the valley beyond, or run the chance of\r\nperishing on the mountain in a storm which seemed unending.  About\r\nmidnight the column reached the valley, very tired and hungry, but\r\nmuch elated over its escape.  We had spent a day of the most intense\r\nanxiety, especially those who had had the responsibility of keeping\r\nto the right trail, and been charged with the hard work of breaking\r\nthe road for the infantry and artillery through such a depth of snow.\r\n\r\nOur main difficulties were now over, and in due time we reached the\r\nDalles, where almost everyone connected with the expedition voted it\r\na wretched failure; indeed, General Rains himself could not think\r\notherwise, but he scattered far and wide blame for the failure of his\r\ncombinations.  This, of course, led to criminations and\r\nrecriminations, which eventuated in charges of incompetency preferred\r\nagainst him by Captain Edward O. C. Ord, of the Third Artillery.\r\nRains met the charges with counter-charges against Ord, whom he\r\naccused of purloining Father Pandoza's shoes, when the soldiers in\r\ntheir fury about the ammunition destroyed the Mission.  At the time\r\nof its destruction a rumor of this nature was circulated through\r\ncamp, started by some wag, no doubt in jest; for Ord, who was\r\nsomewhat eccentric in his habits, and had started on the expedition\r\nrather indifferently shod in carpet-slippers, here came out in a\r\nbrand-new pair of shoes.  Of course there was no real foundation for\r\nsuch a report, but Rains was not above small things, as the bringing\r\nof this petty accusation attests.  Neither party was ever tried, for\r\nGeneral John E. Wool the department commander, had not at command a\r\nsufficient number of officers of appropriate rank to constitute a\r\ncourt in the case of Rains, and the charges against Ord were very\r\nproperly ignored on account of their trifling character.\r\n\r\nShortly after the expedition returned to the Dalles, my detachment\r\nwas sent down to Fort Vancouver, and I remained at that post during\r\nthe winter of 1855-'56, till late in March.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nAN INDIAN CONFEDERATION--MASSACRE AT THE CASCADES OF THE\r\nCOLUMBIA--PLAN TO RELIEVE THE BLOCKHOUSE--A HAZARDOUS FLANK\r\nMOVEMENT--A NEW METHOD OF ESTABLISHING GUILT--EXECUTION OF\r\nTHE INDIAN MURDERERS.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the Haller expedition from lack of a sufficient force,\r\nand of the Rains expedition from the incompetency of its commander,\r\nwas a great mortification to the officers and men connected with\r\nthem, and, taken together, had a marked effect upon the Indian\r\nsituation in Oregon and Washington Territories at that particular\r\nera.  Besides, it led to further complications and troubles, for it\r\nhad begun to dawn upon the Indians that the whites wanted to come in\r\nand dispossess them of their lands and homes, and the failures of\r\nHaller and Rains fostered the belief with the Indians that they could\r\nsuccessfully resist the pressure of civilization.\r\n\r\nActing under these influences, the Spokanes, Walla Wallas, Umatillas,\r\nand Nez Perces cast their lot with the hostiles, and all the savage\r\ninhabitants of the region east of the Cascade Range became involved\r\nin a dispute as to whether the Indians or the Government should\r\npossess certain sections of the country, which finally culminated in\r\nthe war of 1856.\r\n\r\nPartly to meet the situation that was approaching, the Ninth Infantry\r\nhad been sent out from the Atlantic coast to Washington Territory,\r\nand upon its arrival at Fort Vancouver encamped in front of the\r\nofficers' quarters, on the beautiful parade-ground of that post, and\r\nset about preparing for the coming campaign.  The commander, Colonel\r\nGeorge Wright, who had been promoted to the colonelcy of the regiment\r\nupon its organization the previous year, had seen much active duty\r\nsince his graduation over thirty years before, serving with credit in\r\nthe Florida and Mexican wars.  For the three years previous to his\r\nassignment to the Ninth Infantry he had been stationed on the Pacific\r\ncoast, and the experience he had there acquired, added to his\r\nexcellent soldierly qualities, was of much benefit in the active\r\ncampaigns in which, during the following years, he was to\r\nparticipate.  Subsequently his career was brought to an untimely\r\nclose when, nine years after this period, as he was returning to the\r\nscene of his successes, he, in common with many others was drowned by\r\nthe wreck of the ill-fated steamer Brother Jonathan.  Colonel Wright\r\ntook command of the district in place of Rains, and had been at\r\nVancouver but a short time before he realized that it would be\r\nnecessary to fight the confederated tribes east of the Cascade Range\r\nof mountains, in order to disabuse them of the idea that they were\r\nsufficiently strong to cope with the power of the Government.  He\r\ntherefore at once set about the work of organizing and equipping his\r\ntroops for a start in the early spring against the hostile Indians,\r\nintending to make the objective point of his expedition the heart of\r\nthe Spokane country on the Upper Columbia River, as the head and\r\nfront of the confederation was represented in the person of old\r\nCammiackan, chief of the Spokanes.\r\n\r\nThe regiment moved from Fort Vancouver by boat, March 25, 1856, and\r\nlanded at the small town called the Dalles, below the mouth of the\r\nDes Chutes River at the eastern base of the Cascade Range, and just\r\nabove where the Columbia River enters those mountains.  This\r\nrendezvous was to be the immediate point of departure, and all the\r\ntroops composing the expedition were concentrated there.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of March 26 the movement began, but the column had\r\nonly reached Five Mile Creek when the Yakimas, joined by many young\r\nwarriors-free lances from other tribes, made a sudden and unexpected\r\nattack at the Cascades of the Columbia, midway between Vancouver and\r\nthe Dalles, killed several citizens, women and children, and took\r\npossession of the Portage by besieging the settlers in their cabins\r\nat the Upper Cascades, and those who sought shelter at the Middle\r\nCascades in the old military block-house, which had been built some\r\nyears before as a place of refuge under just such circumstances.\r\nThese points held out, and were not captured, but the landing at the\r\nLower Cascades fell completely into the hands of the savages.\r\nStraggling settlers from the Lower Cascades made their way down to\r\nFort Vancouver, distant about thirty-six miles, which they reached\r\nthat night; and communicated the condition of affairs.  As the\r\nnecessity for early relief to the settlers and the re-establishment\r\nof communication with the Dalles were apparent, all the force that\r\ncould be spared was ordered out, and in consequence I immediately\r\nreceived directions to go with my detachment of dragoons, numbering\r\nabout forty effective men, to the relief of the middle blockhouse,\r\nwhich really meant to retake the Cascades.  I got ready at once, and\r\nbelieving that a piece of artillery would be of service to me, asked\r\nfor one, but as there proved to be no guns at the post, I should have\r\nbeen obliged to proceed without one had it not been that the regular\r\nsteamer from San Francisco to Portland was lying at the Vancouver\r\ndock unloading military supplies, and the commander, Captain Dall,\r\nsupplied me with the steamer's small iron cannon, mounted on a wooden\r\nplatform, which he used in firing salutes at different ports on the\r\narrival and departure of the vessel.  Finding at the arsenal a supply\r\nof solid shot that would fit the gun, I had it put upon the steamboat\r\nBelle, employed to carry my command to the scene of operations, and\r\nstarted up the Columbia River at 2 A.M. on the morning of the 27th.\r\nWe reached the Lower Cascades early in the day, where, selecting a\r\nfavorable place for the purpose, I disembarked my men and gun on the\r\nnorth bank of the river, so that I could send back the steamboat to\r\nbring up any volunteer assistance that in the mean time might have\r\nbeen collected at Vancouver.\r\n\r\nThe Columbia River was very high at the time, and the water had\r\nbacked up into the slough about the foot of the Lower Cascades to\r\nsuch a degree that it left me only a narrow neck of firm ground to\r\nadvance over toward the point occupied by the Indians.  On this neck\r\nof land the hostiles had taken position, as I soon learned by\r\nfrequent shots, loud shouting, and much blustering; they, by the most\r\nexasperating yells and indecent exhibitions, daring me to the\r\ncontest.\r\n\r\nAfter getting well in hand everything connected with my little\r\ncommand, I advanced with five or six men to the edge of a growth of\r\nunderbrush to make a reconnoissance.  We stole along under cover of\r\nthis underbrush until we reached the open ground leading over the\r\ncauseway or narrow neck before mentioned, when the enemy opened fire\r\nand killed a soldier near my side by a shot which, just grazing the\r\nbridge of my nose, struck him in the neck, opening an artery and\r\nbreaking the spinal cord.  He died instantly.  The Indians at once\r\nmade a rush for the body, but my men in the rear, coming quickly to\r\nthe rescue, drove them back; and Captain Doll's gun being now brought\r\ninto play, many solid shot were thrown into the jungle where they lay\r\nconcealed, with the effect of considerably moderating their\r\nimpetuosity.  Further skirmishing at long range took place at\r\nintervals during the day, with little gain or loss, however, to\r\neither side, for both parties held positions which could not be\r\nassailed in flank, and only the extreme of rashness in either could\r\nprompt a front attack.  My left was protected by the back water\r\ndriven into the slough by the high stage of the river, and my right\r\nrested secure on the main stream.  Between us was only the narrow\r\nneck of land, to cross which would be certain death.  The position of\r\nthe Indians was almost the exact counterpart of ours.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I sent a report of the situation back to Vancouver by\r\nthe steamboat, retaining a large Hudson's Bay bateau which I had\r\nbrought up with me.  Examining this I found it would carry about\r\ntwenty men, and made up my mind that early next morning I would cross\r\nthe command to the opposite or south side of the Columbia River, and\r\nmake my way up along the mountain base until I arrived abreast the\r\nmiddle blockhouse, which was still closely besieged, and then at some\r\nfavorable point recross to the north bank to its relief, endeavoring\r\nin this manner to pass around and to the rear of the Indians, whose\r\nposition confronting me was too strong for a direct attack.  This\r\nplan was hazardous, but I believed it could be successfully carried\r\nout if the boat could be taken with me; but should I not be able to\r\ndo this I felt that the object contemplated in sending me out would\r\nmiserably fail, and the small band cooped up at the block-house would\r\nsoon starve or fall a prey to the Indians, so I concluded to risk all\r\nthe chances the plan involved.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of March 28 the savages were still in my front, and\r\nafter giving them some solid shot from Captain Dall's gun we slipped\r\ndown to the river-bank, and the detachment crossed by means of the\r\nHudson's Bay boat, making a landing on the opposite shore at a point\r\nwhere the south channel of the river, after flowing around Bradford's\r\nIsland, joins the main stream.  It was then about 9 o'clock, and\r\neverything had thus far proceeded favorably, but examination of the\r\nchannel showed that it would be impossible to get the boat up the\r\nrapids along the mainland, and that success could only be assured by\r\ncrossing the south channel just below the rapids to the island, along\r\nthe shore of which there was every probability we could pull the boat\r\nthrough the rocks and swift water until the head of the rapids was\r\nreached, from which point to the block-house there was smooth water.\r\nTelling the men of the embarrassment in which I found myself, and\r\nthat if I could get enough of them to man the boat and pull it up the\r\nstream by a rope to the shore we would cross to the island and make\r\nthe attempt, all volunteered to go, but as ten men seemed sufficient\r\nI selected that number to accompany me.  Before starting, however, I\r\ndeemed it prudent to find out if possible what was engaging the\r\nattention of the Indians, who had not yet discovered that we had left\r\ntheir front.  I therefore climbed up the side of the abrupt mountain\r\nwhich skirted the water's edge until I could see across the island.\r\nFrom this point I observed the Indians running horse-races and\r\notherwise enjoying themselves behind the line they had held against\r\nme the day before.  The squaws decked out in gay colors, and the men\r\ngaudily dressed in war bonnets, made the scene most attractive, but\r\nas everything looked propitious for the dangerous enterprise in hand\r\nI spent little time watching them.  Quickly returning to the boat, I\r\ncrossed to the island with my ten men, threw ashore the rope attached\r\nto the bow, and commenced the difficult task of pulling her up the\r\nrapids.  We got along slowly at first, but soon striking a camp of\r\nold squaws who had been left on the island for safety, and had not\r\ngone over to the mainland to see the races, we utilized them to our\r\nadvantage.  With unmistakable threats and signs we made them not only\r\nkeep quiet, but also give us much needed assistance in pulling\r\nvigorously on the towrope of our boat.\r\n\r\nI was laboring under a dreadful strain of mental anxiety during all\r\nthis time, for had the Indians discovered what we were about, they\r\ncould easily have come over to the island in their canoes, and, by\r\nforcing us to take up our arms to repel their attack, doubtless would\r\nhave obliged the abandonment of the boat, and that essential adjunct\r\nto the final success of my plan would have gone down the rapids.\r\nIndeed, under such circumstances, it would have been impossible for\r\nten men to hold out against the two or three hundred Indians; but the\r\nisland forming an excellent screen to our movements, we were not\r\ndiscovered, and when we reached the smooth water at the upper end of\r\nthe rapids we quickly crossed over and joined the rest of the men,\r\nwho in the meantime had worked their way along the south bank of the\r\nriver parallel with us.  I felt very grateful to the old squaws for\r\nthe assistance they rendered.  They worked well under compulsion, and\r\nmanifested no disposition to strike for higher wages.  Indeed, I was\r\nso much relieved when we had crossed over from the island and joined\r\nthe rest of the party, that I mentally thanked the squaws one and\r\nall.  I had much difficulty in keeping the men on the main shore from\r\ncheering at our success, but hurriedly taking into the bateau all of\r\nthem it could carry, I sent the balance along the southern bank,\r\nwhere the railroad is now built, until both detachments arrived at a\r\npoint opposite the block-house, when, crossing to the north bank, I\r\nlanded below the blockhouse some little distance, and returned the\r\nboat for the balance of the men, who joined me in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nWhen the Indians attacked the people at the Cascades on the 26th,\r\nword was sent to Colonel Wright, who had already got out from the\r\nDalles a few miles on his expedition to the Spokane country.  He\r\nimmediately turned his column back, and soon after I had landed and\r\ncommunicated with the beleaguered block-house the advance of his\r\ncommand arrived under Lieutenant-Colonel Edward J. Steptoe.  I\r\nreported to Steptoe, and related what had occurred during the past\r\nthirty-six hours, gave him a description of the festivities that were\r\ngoing on at the lower Cascades, and also communicated the\r\nintelligence that the Yakimas had been joined by the Cascade Indians\r\nwhen the place was first attacked.  I also told him it was my belief\r\nthat when he pushed down the main shore the latter tribe without\r\ndoubt would cross over to the island we had just left, while the\r\nformer would take to the mountains.  Steptoe coincided with me in\r\nthis opinion, and informing me that Lieutenant Alexander Piper would\r\njoin my detachment with a mountain' howitzer, directed me to convey\r\nthe command to the island and gobble up all who came over to it.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Piper and I landed on the island with the first boatload,\r\nand after disembarking the howitzer we fired two or three shots to\r\nlet the Indians know we had artillery with us, then advanced down the\r\nisland with the whole of my command, which had arrived in the mean\r\ntime; all of the men were deployed as skirmishers except a small\r\ndetachment to operate the howitzer.  Near the lower end of the island\r\nwe met, as I had anticipated, the entire body of Cascade Indianmen,\r\nwomen, and children--whose homes were in the vicinity of the\r\nCascades.  They were very much frightened and demoralized at the turn\r\nevents had taken, for the Yakimas at the approach of Steptoe had\r\nabandoned them, as predicted, and fled to the mountians.  The chief\r\nand head-men said they had had nothing to do with the capture of the\r\nCascades, with the murder of men at the upper landing, nor with the\r\nmassacre of men, women, and children near the block-house, and put\r\nall the blame on the Yakimas and their allies.  I did not believe\r\nthis, however, and to test the truth of their statement formed them\r\nall in line with their muskets in hand.  Going up to the first man on\r\nthe right I accused him of having engaged in the massacre, but was\r\nmet by a vigorous denial.  Putting my forefinger into the muzzle of\r\nhis gun, I found unmistakable signs of its having been recently\r\ndischarged.  My finger was black with the stains of burnt powder, and\r\nholding it up to the Indian, he had nothing more to say in the face\r\nof such positive evidence of his guilt.  A further examination proved\r\nthat all the guns were in the same condition.  Their arms were at\r\nonce taken possession of, and leaving a small, force to look after\r\nthe women and children and the very old men, so that there could be\r\nno possibility of escape, I arrested thirteen of the principal\r\nmiscreants, crossed the river to the lower landing, and placed them\r\nin charge of a strong guard.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening the steamboat, which I had sent back to\r\nVancouver, returned, bringing to my assistance from Vancouver,\r\nCaptain Henry D. Wallen's company of the Fourth Infantry and a\r\ncompany of volunteers hastily organized at Portland, but as the\r\nCascades had already been retaken, this reinforcement was too late to\r\nparticipate in the affair.  The volunteers from Portland, however,\r\nwere spoiling for a fight, and in the absence of other opportunity\r\ndesired to shoot the prisoners I held (who, they alleged, had killed\r\na man named Seymour), and proceeded to make their arrangements to do\r\nso, only desisting on being informed that the Indians were my\r\nprisoners, subject to the orders of Colonel Wright, and would be\r\nprotected to the last by my detachment.  Not long afterward Seymour\r\nturned up safe and sound, having fled at the beginning of the attack\r\non the Cascades, and hid somewhere in the thick underbrush until the\r\ntrouble was over, and then made his way back to the settlement.  The\r\nnext day I turned my prisoners over to Colonel Wright, who had them\r\nmarched to the upper landing of the Cascades, where, after a trial by\r\na military commission, nine of them were sentenced to death and duly\r\nhanged.  I did not see them executed, but was afterward informed\r\nthat, in the absence of the usual mechanical apparatus used on such\r\noccasions, a tree with a convenient limb under which two empty\r\nbarrels were placed, one on top of the other, furnished a rude but\r\ncertain substitute.  In executing the sentence each Indian in turn\r\nwas made to stand on the top barrel, and after the noose was adjusted\r\nthe lower barrel was knocked away, and the necessary drop thus\r\nobtained.  In this way the whole nine were punished.  Just before\r\ndeath they all acknowledged their guilt by confessing their\r\nparticipation in the massacre at the block-house, and met their doom\r\nwith the usual stoicism of their race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nMISDIRECTED VENGEANCE--HONORABLE MENTION--CHANGE OF COMMAND--EDUCATED\r\nOXEN--FEEDING THE INDIANS--PURCHASING A BURYING-GROUND--KNOWING RATS.\r\n\r\nWhile still encamped at the lower landing, some three or four days\r\nafter the events last recounted, Mr. Joseph Meek, an old frontiersman\r\nand guide for emigrant trains through the mountains, came down from\r\nthe Dalles, on his way to Vancouver, and stopped at my camp to\r\ninquire if an Indian named Spencer and his family had passed down to\r\nVancouver since my arrival at the Cascades.  Spencer, the head of the\r\nfamily, was a very influential, peaceable Chinook chief, whom Colonel\r\nWright had taken with him from Fort Vancouver as an interpreter and\r\nmediator with the Spokanes and other hostile tribes, against which\r\nhis campaign was directed.  He was a good, reliable Indian, and on\r\nleaving Vancouver to join Colonel Wright, took his family along, to\r\nremain with relatives and friends at Fort Dalles until the return of\r\nthe expedition.  When Wright was compelled to retrace his steps on\r\naccount of the capture of the Cascades, this family for some reason\r\nknown only to Spencer, was started by him down the river to their\r\nhome at Vancouver.\r\n\r\nMeek, on seeing the family leave the Dalles, had some misgivings as\r\nto their safe arrival at their destination, because of the excited\r\ncondition of the people about the Cascades; but Spencer seemed to\r\nthink that his own peaceable and friendly reputation, which was\r\nwidespread, would protect them; so he parted from his wife and\r\nchildren with little apprehension as to their safety.  In reply to\r\nMeek's question, I stated that I had not seen Spencer's family, when\r\nhe remarked, \"Well, I fear that they are gone up,\" a phrase used in\r\nthat country in early days to mean that they had been killed.  I\r\nquestioned him closely, to elicit further information, but no more\r\ncould be obtained; for Meek, either through ignorance or the usual\r\ntaciturnity of his class, did not explain more fully, and when the\r\nsteamer that had brought the reinforcement started down the river, he\r\ntook passage for Vancouver, to learn definitely if the Indian family\r\nhad reached that point.  I at once sent to the upper landing, distant\r\nabout six miles, to make inquiry in regard to the matter, and in a,\r\nlittle time my messenger returned with the information that the\r\nfamily had reached that place the day before, and finding that we had\r\ndriven the hostiles off, continued their journey on foot toward my\r\ncamp, from which point they expected to go by steamer down the river\r\nto Vancouver.\r\n\r\nTheir non-arrival aroused in me suspicions of foul play, so with all\r\nthe men I could spare, and accompanied by Lieutenant William T.\r\nWelcker, of the Ordnance Corps--a warm and intimate friend--I went in\r\nsearch of the family, deploying the men as skirmishers across the\r\nvalley, and marching them through the heavy forest where the ground\r\nwas covered with fallen timber and dense underbrush, in order that no\r\npoint might escape our attention.  The search was continued between\r\nthe base of the mountain and the river without finding any sign of\r\nSpencer's family, until about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, when we\r\ndiscovered them between the upper and lower landing, in a small open\r\nspace about a mile from the road, all dead--strangled to death with\r\nbits of rope.  The party consisted of the mother, two youths, three\r\ngirls, and a baby.  They had all been killed by white men, who had\r\nprobably met the innocent creatures somewhere near the blockhouse,\r\ndriven them from the road into the timber, where the cruel murders\r\nwere committed without provocation, and for no other purpose than the\r\ngratification of the inordinate hatred of the Indian that has often\r\nexisted on the frontier, and which on more than one occasion has\r\nfailed to distinguish friend from foe.  The bodies lay in a\r\nsemicircle, and the bits of rope with which the poor wretches had\r\nbeen strangled to death were still around their necks.  Each piece of\r\nrope--the unwound strand of a heavier piece--was about two feet long,\r\nand encircled the neck of its victim with a single knot, that must\r\nhave been drawn tight by the murderers pulling at the ends.  As there\r\nhad not been quite enough rope to answer for all, the babe was\r\nstrangled by means of a red silk handkerchief, taken, doubtless, from\r\nthe neck of its mother.  It was a distressing sight.  A most cruel\r\noutrage had been committed upon unarmed people--our friends and\r\nallies--in a spirit of aimless revenge.  The perpetrators were\r\ncitizens living near the middle block-house, whose wives and children\r\nhad been killed a few days before by the hostiles, but who well knew\r\nthat these unoffending creatures had had nothing to do with those\r\nmurders.\r\n\r\nIn my experience I have been obliged to look upon many cruel scenes\r\nin connection with Indian warfare on the Plains since that day, but\r\nthe effect of this dastardly and revolting crime has never been\r\neffaced from my memory.  Greater and more atrocious massacres have\r\nbeen committed often by Indians; their savage nature modifies one's\r\nideas, however, as to the inhumanity of their acts, but when such\r\nwholesale murder as this is done by whites, and the victims not only\r\ninnocent, but helpless, no defense can be made for those who\r\nperpetrated the crime, if they claim to be civilized beings.  It is\r\ntrue the people at the Cascades had suffered much, and that their\r\nwives and children had been murdered before their eyes, but to wreak\r\nvengeance on Spencer's unoffending family, who had walked into their\r\nsettlement under the protection of a friendly alliance, was an\r\nunparalleled outrage which nothing can justify or extenuate.  With as\r\nlittle delay as possible after the horrible discovery, I returned to\r\ncamp, had boxes made, and next day buried the bodies of these hapless\r\nvictims of misdirected vengeance.\r\n\r\nThe summary punishment inflicted on the nine Indians, in their trial\r\nand execution, had a most salutary effect on the confederation, and\r\nwas the entering wedge to its disintegration; and though Colonel\r\nWright's campaign continued during the summer and into the early\r\nwinter, the subjugation of the allied bands became a comparatively\r\neasy matter after the lesson taught the renegades who were captured\r\nat the Cascades.  My detachment did not accompany Colonel Wright, but\r\nremained for some time at the Cascades, and while still there General\r\nWool came up from San Francisco to take a look into the condition of\r\nthings.  From his conversation with me in reference to the affair at\r\nthe Cascades, I gathered that he was greatly pleased at the service I\r\nhad performed, and I afterward found that his report of my conduct\r\nhad so favorably impressed General Scott that that distinguished\r\nofficer complimented me from the headquarters of the army in general\r\norders.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wool, while personally supervising matters on the Columbia\r\nRiver, directed a redistribution to some extent of the troops in the\r\ndistrict, and shortly before his return to San Francisco I was\r\nordered with my detachment of dragoons to take station on the Grande\r\nRonde Indian Reservation in Yamhill County, Oregon, about twenty-five\r\nmiles southwest of Dayton, and to relieve from duty at that point\r\nLieutenant William B. Hazen--late brigadier-general and chief signal\r\nofficer--who had established a camp there some time before.  I\r\nstarted for my new station on April 21, and marching by way of\r\nPortland and Oregon City, arrived at Hazen's camp April 25.  The camp\r\nwas located in the Coast range of mountains, on the northeast part of\r\nthe reservation, to which last had been added a section of country\r\nthat was afterward known as the Siletz reservation.  The whole body\r\nof land set aside went under the general name of the \"Coast\r\nreservation,\" from its skirting the Pacific Ocean for some distance\r\nnorth of Yaquina Bay, and the intention was to establish within its\r\nbounds permanent homes for such Indians as might be removed to it.\r\nIn furtherance of this idea, and to relieve northern California and\r\nsouthwestern Oregon from the roaming, restless bands that kept the\r\npeople of those sections in a state of constant turmoil, many of the\r\ndifferent tribes, still under control but liable to take part in\r\nwarfare, were removed to the reservation, so that they might be away\r\nfrom the theatre of hostilities.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived I found that the Rogue River Indians had just been\r\nplaced upon the reservation, and subsequently the Coquille, Klamath,\r\nModocs, and remnants of the Chinooks were collected there also, the\r\nhome of the latter being in the Willamette Valley.  The number all\r\ntold amounted to some thousands, scattered over the entire Coast\r\nreservation, but about fifteen hundred were located at the Grande\r\nRonde under charge of an agent, Mr. John F. Miller, a sensible,\r\npractical man, who left the entire police control to the military,\r\nand attended faithfully to the duty of settling the Indians in the\r\nwork of cultivating the soil.\r\n\r\nAs the place was to be occupied permanently, Lieutenant Hazen had\r\nbegun, before my arrival, the erection of buildings for the shelter\r\nof his command, and I continued the work of constructing the post as\r\nlaid out by him.  In those days the Government did not provide very\r\nliberally for sheltering its soldiers; and officers and men were\r\nfrequently forced to eke out parsimonious appropriations by toilsome\r\nwork or go without shelter in most inhospitable regions.  Of course\r\nthis post was no exception to the general rule, and as all hands were\r\noccupied in its construction, and I the only officer present, I was\r\nkept busily employed in supervising matters, both as commandant and\r\nquartermaster, until July, when Captain D. A. Russell, of the Fourth\r\nInfantry, was ordered to take command, and I was relieved from the\r\nfirst part of my duties.\r\n\r\nAbout this time my little detachment parted from me, being ordered to\r\njoin a company of the First Dragoons, commanded by Captain Robert\r\nWilliams, as it passed up the country from California by way of\r\nYamhill.  I regretted exceedingly to see them go, for their faithful\r\nwork and gallant service had endeared every man to me by the\r\nstrongest ties.  Since I relieved Lieutenant Hood on Pit River,\r\nnearly a twelvemonth before, they had been my constant companions,\r\nand the zeal with which they had responded to every call I made on\r\nthem had inspired in my heart a deep affection that years have not\r\nremoved.  When I relieved Hood--a dragoon officer of their own\r\nregiment--they did not like the change, and I understood that they\r\nsomewhat contemptuously expressed this in more ways than one, in\r\norder to try the temper of the new \"Leftenant,\" but appreciative and\r\nunremitting care, together with firm and just discipline, soon\r\nquieted all symptoms of dissatisfaction and overcame all prejudice.\r\nThe detachment had been made up of details from the different\r\ncompanies of the regiment in order to give Williamson a mounted\r\nforce, and as it was usual, under such circumstances, for every\r\ncompany commander to shove into the detail he was called upon to\r\nfurnish the most troublesome and insubordinate individuals of his\r\ncompany, I had some difficulty, when first taking command, in\r\ncontrolling such a medley of recalcitrants; but by forethought for\r\nthem and their wants, and a strict watchfulness for their rights and\r\ncomfort, I was able in a short time to make them obedient and the\r\ndetachment cohesive.  In the past year they had made long and\r\ntiresome marches, forded swift mountain streams, constructed rafts of\r\nlogs or bundles of dry reeds to ferry our baggage, swum deep rivers,\r\nmarched on foot to save their worn-out and exhausted animals, climbed\r\nmountains, fought Indians, and in all and everything had done the\r\nbest they could for the service and their commander.  The disaffected\r\nfeeling they entertained when I first assumed command soon wore away,\r\nand in its place came a confidence and respect which it gives me the\r\ngreatest pleasure to remember, for small though it was, this was my\r\nfirst cavalry command.  They little thought, when we were in the\r\nmountains of California and Oregon--nor did I myself then dream--that\r\nbut a few years were to elapse before it would be my lot again to\r\ncommand dragoons, this time in numbers so vast as of themselves to\r\ncompose almost an army.\r\n\r\nShortly after the arrival of Captain Russell a portion of the Indians\r\nat the Grande Ronde reservation were taken down the coast to the\r\nSiletz reservation, and I was transferred temporarily to Fort\r\nHaskins, on the latter reserve, and assigned to the duty of\r\ncompleting it and building a blockhouse for the police control of the\r\nIndians placed there.\r\n\r\nWhile directing this work, I undertook to make a road across the\r\ncoast mountains from King's Valley to the Siletz, to shorten the haul\r\nbetween the two points by a route I had explored.  I knew there were\r\nmany obstacles in the way, but the gain would be great if we could\r\novercome them, so I set to work with the enthusiasm of a young\r\npath-finder.  The point at which the road was to cross the range was\r\nrough and precipitous, but the principal difficulty in making it would\r\nbe from heavy timber on the mountains that had been burned over years\r\nand years before, until nothing was left but limbless trunks of dead\r\ntrees--firs and pines--that had fallen from time to time until the\r\nground was matted with huge logs from five to eight feet in diameter.\r\nThese could not be chopped with axes nor sawed by any ordinary means,\r\ntherefore we had to burn them into suitable lengths, and drag the\r\nsections to either side of the roadway with from four to six yoke of\r\noxen.\r\n\r\nThe work was both tedious and laborious, but in time perseverance\r\nsurmounted all obstacles and the road was finished, though its grades\r\nwere very steep.  As soon as it was completed, I wished to\r\ndemonstrate its value practically, so I started a Government wagon\r\nover it loaded with about fifteen hundred pounds of freight drawn by\r\nsix yoke of oxen, and escorted by a small detachment of soldiers.\r\nWhen it had gone about seven miles the sergeant in charge came back\r\nto the post and reported his inability to get any further.  Going out\r\nto the scene of difficulty I found the wagon at the base of a steep\r\nhill, stalled.  Taking up a whip myself, I directed the men to lay on\r\ntheir gads, for each man had supplied himself with a flexible hickory\r\nwithe in the early stages of the trip, to start the team, but this\r\ncourse did not move the wagon nor have much effect on the demoralized\r\noxen; but following as a last resort an example I heard of on a\r\nformer occasion, that brought into use the rough language of the\r\ncountry, I induced the oxen to move with alacrity, and the wagon and\r\ncontents were speedily carried to the summit.  The whole trouble was\r\nat once revealed: the oxen had been broken and trained by a man who,\r\nwhen they were in a pinch, had encouraged them by his frontier\r\nvocabulary, and they could not realize what was expected of them\r\nunder extraordinary conditions until they heard familiar and possibly\r\nprofanely urgent phrases.  I took the wagon to its destination, but\r\nas it was not brought back, even in all the time I was stationed in\r\nthat country, I think comment on the success of my road is\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\nI spent many happy months at Fort Haskins, remaining there until the\r\npost was nearly completed and its garrison increased by the arrival\r\nof Captain F. T. Dent--a brother-in-law of Captain Ulysses S. Grant\r\n--with his company of the Fourth Infantry, in April, 1857.  In the\r\nsummer of 1856, and while I was still on duty there, the Coquille\r\nIndians on the Siletz, and down near the Yaquina Bay, became, on\r\naccount of hunger and prospective starvation, very much excited and\r\nexasperated, getting beyond the control of their agent, and even\r\nthreatening his life, so a detachment of troops was sent out to set\r\nthings to rights, and I took command of it.  I took with me most of\r\nthe company, and arrived at Yaquina Bay in time to succor the agent,\r\nwho for some days had been besieged in a log hut by the Indians and\r\nhad almost abandoned hope of rescue.\r\n\r\nHaving brought with me over the mountains a few head of beef cattle\r\nfor the hungry Indians, without thinking of running any great\r\npersonal risk I had six beeves killed some little distance from my\r\ncamp, guarding the meat with four Soldiers, whom I was obliged to\r\npost as sentinels around the small area on which the carcasses lay.\r\nThe Indians soon formed a circle about the sentinels, and impelled by\r\nstarvation, attempted to take the beef before it could be equally\r\ndivided.  This was of course resisted, when they drew their knives\r\n--their guns having been previously taken away from them--and some of\r\nthe inferior chiefs gave the signal to attack.  The principal chief,\r\nTetootney John, and two other Indians joined me in the centre of the\r\ncircle, and protesting that they would die rather than that the\r\nfrenzied onslaught should succeed, harangued the Indians until the\r\nrest of the company hastened up from camp and put an end to the\r\ndisturbance.  I always felt grateful to Tetootney John for his\r\nloyalty on this occasion, and many times afterward aided his family\r\nwith a little coffee and sugar, but necessarily surreptitiously, so\r\nas not to heighten the prejudices that his friendly act had aroused\r\namong his Indian comrades.\r\n\r\nThe situation at Yaquina Bay did not seem very safe, notwithstanding\r\nthe supply of beef we brought; and the possibility that the starving\r\nIndians might break out was ever present, so to anticipate any\r\nfurther revolt, I called for more troops.  The request was complied\r\nwith by sending to my assistance the greater part of my own company\r\n(\"K\")from Fort Yamhill.  The men, inspired by the urgency of our\r\nsituation, marched more than forty miles a day, accomplishing the\r\nwhole distance in so short a period, that I doubt if the record has\r\never been beaten.  When this reinforcement arrived, the Indians saw\r\nthe futility of further demonstrations against their agent, who they\r\nseemed to think was responsible for the insufficiency of food, and\r\nmanaged to exist with the slender rations we could spare and such\r\nindifferent food as they could pick up, until the Indian Department\r\nsucceeded in getting up its regular supplies.  In the past the poor\r\nthings had often been pinched by hunger and neglect, and at times\r\ntheir only food was rock oysters, clams and crabs.  Great quantities\r\nof these shell-fish could be gathered in the bay near at hand, but\r\nthe mountain Indians, who had heretofore lived on the flesh of\r\nmammal, did not take kindly to mollusks, and, indeed, ate the\r\nshell-fish only as a last resort.\r\n\r\nCrab catching at night on the Yaquina Bay by the coast Indians was a\r\nvery picturesque scene.  It was mostly done by the squaws and\r\nchildren, each equipped with a torch in one hand, and a sharp-pointed\r\nstick in the other to take and lift the fish into baskets slung on\r\nthe back to receive them.  I have seen at times hundreds of squaws\r\nand children wading about in Yaquina Bay taking crabs in this manner,\r\nand the reflection by the water of the light from the many torches,\r\nwith the movements of the Indians while at work, formed a weird and\r\ndiverting picture of which we were never tired.\r\n\r\nNot long after the arrival of the additional troops from Yamhill, it\r\nbecame apparent that the number of men at Yaquina Bay would have to\r\nbe reduced, so in view of this necessity, it was deemed advisable to\r\nbuild a block-house for the better protection of the agents and I\r\nlooked about for suitable ground on which to erect it.  Nearly all\r\naround the bay the land rose up from the beach very abruptly, and the\r\nonly good site that could be found was some level ground used as the\r\nburial-place of the Yaquina Bay Indians--a small band of fish-eating\r\npeople who had lived near this point on the coast for ages.  They\r\nwere a robust lot, of tall and well-shaped figures, and were called\r\nin the Chinook tongue \"salt chuck,\" which means fish-eaters, or\r\neaters of food from the salt water.  Many of the young men and women\r\nwere handsome in feature below the forehead, having fine eyes,\r\naquiline noses and good mouths, but, in conformity with a\r\nlong-standing custom, all had flat heads, which gave them a distorted\r\nand hideous appearance, particularly some of the women, who went to\r\nthe extreme of fashion and flattened the head to the rear in a sharp\r\nhorizontal ridge by confining it between two boards, one running back\r\nfrom the forehead at an angle of about forty degrees, and the other up\r\nperpendicularly from the back of the neck.  When a head had been\r\nshaped artistically the dusky maiden owner was marked as a belle, and\r\none could become reconciled to it after a time, but when carelessness\r\nand neglect had governed in the adjustment of the boards, there\r\nprobably was nothing in the form of a human being on the face of the\r\nearth that appeared so ugly.\r\n\r\nIt was the mortuary ground of these Indians that occupied the only\r\nlevel spot we could get for the block-house.  Their dead were buried\r\nin canoes, which rested in the crotches of forked sticks a few feet\r\nabove-ground.  The graveyard was not large, containing probably from\r\nforty to fifty canoes in a fair state of preservation.  According to\r\nthe custom of all Indian tribes on the Pacific coast, when one of\r\ntheir number died all his worldly effects were buried with him, so\r\nthat the canoes were filled with old clothes, blankets, pieces of\r\ncalico and the like, intended for the use of the departed in the\r\nhappy hunting grounds.\r\n\r\nI made known to the Indians that we would have to take this piece of\r\nground for the blockhouse.  They demurred at first, for there is\r\nnothing more painful to an Indian than disturbing his dead, but they\r\nfinally consented to hold a council next day on the beach, and thus\r\ncome to some definite conclusion.  Next morning they all assembled,\r\nand we talked in the Chinook language all day long, until at last\r\nthey gave in, consenting, probably, as much because they could not\r\nhelp themselves, as for any other reason.  It was agreed that on the\r\nfollowing day at 12 o'clock, when the tide was going out, I should\r\ntake my men and place the canoes in the bay, and let them float out\r\non the tide across the ocean to the happy hunting-grounds:\r\n\r\nAt that day there existed in Oregon in vast numbers a species of\r\nwood-rat, and our inspection of the graveyard showed that the canoes\r\nwere thickly infested with them.  They were a light gray animal,\r\nlarger than the common gray squirrel, with beautiful bushy tails,\r\nwhich made them strikingly resemble the squirrel, but in cunning and\r\ndeviltry they were much ahead of that quick-witted rodent.  I have\r\nknown them to empty in one night a keg of spikes in the storehouse in\r\nYamhill, distributing them along the stringers of the building, with\r\napparently no other purpose than amusement.  We anticipated great fun\r\nwatching the efforts of these rats to escape the next day when the\r\ncanoes should be launched on the ocean, and I therefore forbade any\r\nof the command to visit the graveyard in the interim, lest the rats\r\nshould be alarmed.  I well knew that they would not be disturbed by\r\nthe Indians, who held the sacred spot in awe.  When the work of\r\ntaking down the canoes and carrying them to the water began,\r\nexpectation was on tiptoe, but, strange as it may seem, not a rat was\r\nto be seen.  This unexpected development was mystifying.  They had\r\nall disappeared; there was not one in any of the canoes, as\r\ninvestigation proved, for disappointment instigated a most thorough\r\nsearch.  The Indians said the rats understood Chinook, and that as\r\nthey had no wish to accompany the dead across the ocean to the happy\r\nhunting-grounds, they took to the woods for safety.  However that may\r\nbe, I have no doubt that the preceding visits to the burial-ground,\r\nand our long talk of the day before, with the unusual stir and\r\nbustle, had so alarmed the rats that, impelled, by their suspicious\r\ninstincts, they fled a danger, the nature of which they could not\r\nanticipate, but which they felt to be none the less real and\r\nimpending.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nLEARNING THE CHINOOK LANGUAGE--STRANGE INDIAN\r\nCUSTOMS--THEIR DOCTORS--SAM PATCH--THE MURDER OF A\r\nWOMAN--IN A TIGHT PLACE--SURPRISING THE INDIANS--CONFLICTING\r\nREPORTS OF THE BATTLE OF BULL RUN--SECESSION QUESTION IN\r\nCALIFORNIA--APPOINTED A CAPTAIN--TRANSFERRED TO THE EAST.\r\n\r\nThe troubles at the Siletz and Yaquina Bay were settled without\r\nfurther excitement by the arrival in due time of plenty of food, and\r\nas the buildings, at Fort Haskins were so near completion that my\r\nservices as quartermaster were no longer needed, I was ordered to\r\njoin my own company at Fort Yamhill, where Captain Russell was still\r\nin command.  I returned to that place in May, 1857, and at a period a\r\nlittle later, in consequence of the close of hostilities in southern\r\nOregon, the Klamaths and Modocs were sent back to their own country,\r\nto that section in which occurred, in 1873, the disastrous war with\r\nthe latter tribe.  This reduced considerably the number of Indians at\r\nthe Grande Ronde, but as those remaining were still somewhat unruly,\r\nfrom the fact that many questions requiring adjustment were\r\nconstantly arising between the different bands, the agent and the\r\nofficers at the post were kept pretty well occupied.  Captain Russell\r\nassigned to me the special work of keeping up the police control, and\r\nas I had learned at an early day to speak Chinook (the \"court\r\nlanguage\" among the coast tribes) almost as well as the Indians\r\nthemselves, I was thereby enabled to steer my way successfully on\r\nmany critical occasions.\r\n\r\nFor some time the most disturbing and most troublesome element we had\r\nwas the Rogue River band.  For three or four years they had fought\r\nour troops obstinately, and surrendered at the bitter end in the\r\nbelief that they were merely overpowered, not conquered.  They openly\r\nboasted to the other Indians that they could whip the soldiers, and\r\nthat they did not wish to follow the white man's ways, continuing\r\nconsistently their wild habits, unmindful of all admonitions.\r\nIndeed, they often destroyed their household utensils, tepees and\r\nclothing, and killed their horses on the graves of the dead, in the\r\nfulfillment of a superstitious custom, which demanded that they\r\nshould undergo, while mourning for their kindred, the deepest\r\nprivation in a property sense.  Everything the loss of which would\r\nmake them poor was sacrificed on the graves of their relatives or\r\ndistinguished warriors, and as melancholy because of removal from\r\ntheir old homes caused frequent deaths, there was no lack of occasion\r\nfor the sacrifices.  The widows and orphans of the dead warriors were\r\nof course the chief mourners, and exhibited their grief in many\r\npeculiar ways.  I remember one in particular which was universally\r\npracticed by the near kinsfolk.  They would crop their hair very\r\nclose, and then cover the head with a sort of hood or plaster of\r\nblack pitch, the composition being clay, pulverized charcoal, and the\r\nresinous gum which exudes from the pine-tree.  The hood, nearly an\r\ninch in thickness, was worn during a period of mourning that lasted\r\nthrough the time it would take nature, by the growth of the hair,\r\nactually to lift from the head the heavy covering of pitch after it\r\nhad become solidified and hard as stone.  It must be admitted that\r\nthey underwent considerable discomfort in memory of their relatives.\r\nIt took all the influence we could bring to bear to break up these\r\nabsurdly superstitious practices, and it looked as if no permanent\r\nimprovement could be effected, for as soon as we got them to discard\r\none, another would be invented.  When not allowed to burn down their\r\ntepees or houses, those poor souls who were in a dying condition\r\nwould be carried out to the neighboring hillsides just before\r\ndissolution, and there abandoned to their sufferings, with little or\r\nno attention, unless the placing under their heads of a small stick\r\nof wood--with possibly some laudable object, but doubtless great\r\ndiscomfort to their victim--might be considered such.\r\n\r\nTo uproot these senseless and monstrous practices was indeed most\r\ndifficult.  The most pernicious of all was one which was likely to\r\nbring about tragic results.  They believed firmly in a class of\r\ndoctors among their people who professed that they could procure the\r\nillness of an individual at will, and that by certain incantations\r\nthey could kill or cure the sick person.  Their faith in this\r\nsuperstition was so steadfast that there was no doubting its\r\nsincerity, many indulging at times in the most trying privations,\r\nthat their relatives might be saved from death at the hands of the\r\ndoctors.  I often talked with them on the subject, and tried to\r\nreason them out of the superstitious belief, defying the doctors to\r\nkill me, or even make me ill; but my talks were unavailing, and they\r\nalways met my arguments with the remark that I was a white man, of a\r\nrace wholly different from the red man, and that that was the reason\r\nthe medicine of the doctors would not affect me.  These villainous\r\ndoctors might be either men or women, and any one of them finding an\r\nIndian ill, at once averred that his influence was the cause,\r\noffering at the same time to cure the invalid for a fee, which\r\ngenerally amounted to about all the ponies his family possessed.  If\r\nthe proposition was accepted and the fee paid over, the family, in\r\ncase the man died, was to have indemnity through the death of the\r\ndoctor, who freely promised that they might take his life in such\r\nevent, relying on his chances of getting protection from the furious\r\nrelatives by fleeing to the military post till time had so assuaged\r\ntheir grief that matters could be compromised or settled by a\r\nrestoration of a part of the property, when the rascally leeches\r\ncould again resume their practice.  Of course the services of a\r\ndoctor were always accepted when an Indian fell ill; otherwise the\r\ninvalid's death would surely ensue, brought about by the evil\r\ninfluence that was unpropitiated.  Latterly it had become quite the\r\nthing, when a patient died, for the doctor to flee to our camp--it\r\nwas so convenient and so much safer than elsewhere--and my cellar was\r\na favorite place of refuge from the infuriated friends of the\r\ndeceased.\r\n\r\nAmong the most notable of these doctors was an Indian named Sam\r\nPatch, who several times sought asylum in any cellar, and being a\r\nmost profound diplomat, managed on each occasion and with little\r\ndelay to negotiate a peaceful settlement and go forth in safety to\r\nresume the practice of his nefarious profession.  I often hoped he\r\nwould be caught before reaching the post, but he seemed to know\r\nintuitively when the time had come to take leg-bail, for his advent\r\nat the garrison generally preceded by but a few hours the death of\r\nsome poor dupe.\r\n\r\nFinally these peculiar customs brought about the punishment of a\r\nnoted doctress of the Rogue River tribe, a woman who was constantly\r\nworking in this professional way, and who had found a victim of such\r\nprominence among the Rogue Rivers that his unlooked for death brought\r\ndown on her the wrath of all.  She had made him so ill, they\r\nbelieved, as to bring him to death's door notwithstanding the many\r\nponies that had been given her to cease the incantations, and it was\r\nthe conviction of all that she had finally caused the man's death\r\nfrom some ulterior and indiscernible motive.  His relatives and\r\nfriends then immediately set about requiting her with the just\r\npenalties of a perfidious breach of contract.  Their threats induced\r\nher instant flight toward my house for the usual protection, but the\r\nenraged friends of the dead man gave hot chase, and overtook the\r\nwitch just inside the limits of the garrison, where, on the\r\nparade-ground, in sight of the officers' quarters, and before any one\r\ncould interfere, they killed her.  There were sixteen men in pursuit\r\nof the doctress, and sixteen gun-shot wounds were found in her body\r\nwhen examined by the surgeon of the post.  The killing of the woman\r\nwas a flagrant and defiant outrage committed in the teeth of the\r\nmilitary authority, yet done so quickly that we could not prevent it.\r\nThis necessitated severe measures, both to allay the prevailing\r\nexcitement and to preclude the recurrence of such acts.  The body was\r\ncared for, and delivered to the relatives the next day for burial,\r\nafter which Captain Russell directed me to take such steps as would\r\nput a stop to the fanatical usages that had brought about this\r\nmurderous occurrence, for it was now seen that if timely measures were\r\nnot taken to repress them, similar tragedies would surely follow.\r\n\r\nKnowing all the men of the Rogue River tribe, and speaking fluently\r\nthe Chinook tongue, which they all understood, I went down to their\r\nvillage the following day, after having sent word to the tribe that I\r\nwished to have a council with them.  The Indians all met me in\r\ncouncil, as I had desired, and I then told them that the men who had\r\ntaken part in shooting the woman would have to be delivered up for\r\npunishment.  They were very stiff with me at the interview, and with\r\nall that talent for circumlocution and diplomacy with which the\r\nIndian is lifted, endeavored to evade my demands and delay any\r\nconclusion.  But I was very positive, would hear of no compromise\r\nwhatever, and demanded that my terms be at once complied with.  No\r\none was with me but a sergeant of my company, named Miller, who held\r\nmy horse, and as the chances of an agreement began to grow remote, I\r\nbecame anxious for our safety.  The conversation waxing hot and the\r\nIndians gathering close in around me, I unbuttoned the flap of my\r\npistol holster, to be ready for any emergency.  When the altercation\r\nbecame most bitter I put my hand to my hip to draw my pistol, but\r\ndiscovered it was gone--stolen by one of the rascals surrounding me.\r\nFinding myself unarmed, I modified my tone and manner to correspond\r\nwith my helpless condition, thus myself assuming the diplomatic side\r\nin the parley, in order to gain time.  As soon as an opportunity\r\noffered, and I could, without too much loss of self-respect, and\r\nwithout damaging my reputation among the Indians, I moved out to\r\nwhere the sergeant held my horse, mounted, and crossing the Yamhill\r\nRiver close by, called back in Chinook from the farther bank that\r\n\"the sixteen men who killed the woman must be delivered up, and my\r\nsix-shooter also.\" This was responded to by contemptuous laughter, so\r\nI went back to the military post somewhat crestfallen, and made my\r\nreport of the turn affairs had taken, inwardly longing for another\r\nchance to bring the rascally Rogue Rivers to terms.\r\n\r\nWhen I had explained the situation to Captain Russell, he thought\r\nthat we could not, under any circumstances, overlook this defiant\r\nconduct of the Indians, since, unless summarily punished, it would\r\nlead to even more serious trouble in the future.  I heartily seconded\r\nthis proposition, and gladly embracing the opportunity it offered,\r\nsuggested that if he would give me another chance, and let me have\r\nthe effective force of the garrison, consisting of about fifty men, I\r\nwould chastise the Rogue Rivers without fail, and that the next day\r\nwas all the time I required to complete arrangements.  He gave me the\r\nnecessary authority, and I at once set to work to bring about a\r\nbetter state of discipline on the reservation, and to put an end to\r\nthe practices of the medicine men (having also in view the recovery\r\nof my six-shooter and self-respect), by marching to the village and\r\ntaking the rebellious Indians by force.\r\n\r\nIn the tribe there was an excellent woman called Tighee Mary (Tighee\r\nin Chinook means chief), who by right of inheritance was a kind of\r\nqueen of the Rogue Rivers.  Fearing that the insubordinate conduct of\r\nthe Indians would precipitate further trouble, she came early the\r\nfollowing morning to see me and tell me of the situation Mary\r\ninformed me that she had done all in her power to bring the Indians\r\nto reason, but without avail, and that they were determined to fight\r\nrather than deliver up the sixteen men who had engaged in the\r\nshooting.  She also apprised me of the fact that they had taken up a\r\nposition on the Yamhill River, on the direct road between the post\r\nand village, where, painted and armed for war, they were awaiting\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nOn this information I concluded it would be best to march to the\r\nvillage by a circuitous route instead of directly, as at first\r\nintended, so I had the ferry-boat belonging to the post floated about\r\na mile and a half down the Yamhill River and there anchored.  At 11\r\no'clock that night I marched my fifty men, out of the garrison, in a\r\ndirection opposite to that of the point held by the Indians, and soon\r\nreached the river at the ferryboat.  Here I ferried the party over\r\nwith little delay, and marched them along the side of the mountain,\r\nthrough underbrush and fallen timber, until, just before daylight, I\r\nfound that we were immediately in rear of the village, and thence in\r\nrear, also, of the line occupied by the refractory Indians, who were\r\nexpecting to meet me on the direct road from the post.  Just at break\r\nof day we made a sudden descent upon the village and took its\r\noccupants completely by surprise, even capturing the chief of the\r\ntribe, \"Sam,\" who was dressed in all his war toggery, fully armed and\r\nequipped, in anticipation of a fight on the road where his comrades\r\nwere in position.  I at once put Sam under guard, giving orders to\r\nkill him instantly if the Indians fired a shot; then forming my line\r\non the road beyond the edge of the village, in rear of the force\r\nlying in wait for a front attack, we moved forward.  When the hostile\r\nparty realized that they were completely cut off from the village,\r\nthey came out from their stronghold on the river and took up a line\r\nin my front, distant about sixty yards with the apparent intention of\r\nresisting to the last.\r\n\r\nAs is usual with Indians when expecting a fight, they were nearly\r\nnaked, fantastically painted with blue clay, and hideously arrayed in\r\nwar bonnets.  They seemed very belligerent, brandishing their muskets\r\nin the air, dancing on one foot, calling us ugly names, and making\r\nsuch other demonstrations of hostility, that it seemed at first that\r\nnothing short of the total destruction of the party could bring about\r\nthe definite settlement that we were bent on.  Still, as it was my\r\ndesire to bring them under subjection without loss of life, if\r\npossible, I determined to see what result would follow when they\r\nlearned that their chief was at our mercy.  So, sending Sam under\r\nguard to the front, where he could be seen, informing them that he\r\nwould be immediately shot if they fired upon us, and aided by the\r\ncries and lamentations of the women of the village, who deprecated\r\nany hostile action by either party, I soon procured a parley.\r\n\r\nThe insubordinate Indians were under command of \"Joe,\" Sam's brother,\r\nwho at last sent me word that he wanted to see me, and we met between\r\nour, respective lines.  I talked kindly to him, but was firm in my\r\ndemand that the men who killed the woman must be given up and my\r\nsix-shooter returned.  His reply was he did not think it could be done,\r\nbut he would consult his people.  After the consultation, he returned\r\nand notified me that fifteen would surrender and the six-shooter\r\nwould be restored, and further, that we could kill the sixteenth man,\r\nsince the tribe wished to get rid of him anyhow, adding that he was a\r\nbad Indian, whose bullet no doubt had given the woman her death\r\nwound.  He said that if I assented to this arrangement, he would\r\nrequire all of his people except the objectionable man to run to the\r\nright of his line at a preconcerted signal.  The bad Indian would be\r\nordered to stand fast on the extreme left, and we could open fire on\r\nhim as his comrades fell away to the right.  I agreed to the\r\nproposition, and gave Joe fifteen minutes to execute his part of it.\r\nWe then returned to our respective forces, and a few minutes later\r\nthe fifteen ran to the right flank as agreed upon, and we opened fire\r\non the one Indian left standing alone, bringing him down in his\r\ntracks severely wounded by a shot through the shoulder.\r\n\r\nWhile all this was going on, the other bands of the reservation,\r\nseveral thousand strong, had occupied the surrounding hills for the\r\npurpose of witnessing the fight, for as the Rogue Rivers had been\r\nbragging for some time that they could whip the soldiers, these other\r\nIndians had come out to see it done.  The result, however,\r\ndisappointed the spectators, and the Rogue Rivers naturally lost\r\ncaste.  The fifteen men now came in and laid down their arms\r\n(including my six-shooter) in front of us as agreed, but I compelled\r\nthem to take the surrendered guns up again and carry them to the\r\npost, where they were deposited in the block-house for future\r\nsecurity.  The prisoners were ironed with ball and chain, and made to\r\nwork at the post until their rebellious spirit was broken; and the\r\nwounded man was correspondingly punished after he had fully\r\nrecovered.  An investigation as to why this man had been selected as\r\nthe offering by which Joe and his companions expected to gain\r\nimmunity, showed that the fellow was really a most worthless\r\ncharacter, whose death even would have been a benefit to the tribe.\r\nThus it seemed that they had two purposes in view--the one to\r\npropitiate me and get good terms, the other to rid themselves of a\r\nvagabond member of the tribe.\r\n\r\nThe punishment of these sixteen Indians by ball and chain ended all\r\ntrouble with the Rogue River tribe.  The, disturbances arising from\r\nthe incantations of the doctors and doctresses, and the practice of\r\nkilling horses and burning all worldly property on the graves of\r\nthose who died, were completely suppressed, and we made with little\r\neffort a great stride toward the civilization of these crude and\r\nsuperstitious people, for they now began to recognize the power of\r\nthe Government.  In their management afterward a course of justice\r\nand mild force was adopted, and unvaryingly applied.  They were\r\ncompelled to cultivate their land, to attend church, and to send\r\ntheir children to school.  When I saw them, fifteen years later,\r\ntransformed into industrious and substantial farmers, with neat\r\nhouses, fine cattle, wagons and horses, carrying their grain, eggs,\r\nand butter to market and bringing home flour, coffee, sugar, and\r\ncalico in return, I found abundant confirmation of my early opinion\r\nthat the most effectual measures for lifting them from a state of\r\nbarbarism would be a practical supervision at the outset, coupled\r\nwith a firm control and mild discipline.\r\n\r\nIn all that was done for these Indians Captain Russell's judgment and\r\nsound, practical ideas were the inspiration.  His true manliness,\r\nhonest and just methods, together with the warm-hearted interest he\r\ntook in all that pertained to matters of duty to his Government,\r\ncould not have produced other than the best results, in what position\r\nsoever he might have been placed.  As all the lovable traits of his\r\ncharacter were constantly manifested, I became most deeply attached\r\nto him, and until the day of his death in 1864, on the battle-field\r\nof Opequan, in front of Winchester, while gallantly leading his\r\ndivision under my command, my esteem and affection were sustained and\r\nintensified by the same strong bonds that drew me to him in these\r\nearly days in Oregon.\r\n\r\nAfter the events just narrated I continued on duty at the post of\r\nYamhill, experiencing the usual routine of garrison life without any\r\nincidents of much interest, down to the breaking out of the war of\r\nthe rebellion in April, 1861.  The news of the firing on Fort Sumter\r\nbrought us an excitement which overshadowed all else, and though we\r\nhad no officers at the post who sympathized with the rebellion, there\r\nwere several in our regiment--the Fourth Infantry--who did, and we\r\nwere considerably exercised as to the course they might pursue, but\r\nnaturally far more so concerning the disposition that would be made\r\nof the regiment during the conflict.\r\n\r\nIn due time orders came for the regiment to go East, and my company\r\nwent off, leaving me, however--a second lieutenant--in command of the\r\npost until I should be relieved by Captain James J. Archer, of the\r\nNinth Infantry, whose company was to take the place of the old\r\ngarrison.  Captain Archer, with his company of the Ninth, arrived\r\nshortly after, but I had been notified that he intended to go South,\r\nand his conduct was such after reaching the post that I would not\r\nturn over the command to him for fear he might commit some rebellious\r\nact.  Thus a more prolonged detention occurred than I had at first\r\nanticipated.  Finally the news came that he had tendered his\r\nresignation and been granted a leave of absence for sixty days.  On\r\nJuly 17 he took his departure, but I continued in command till\r\nSeptember 1, when Captain Philip A. Owen, of the Ninth Infantry,\r\narrived and, taking charge, gave me my release.\r\n\r\nFrom the day we received the news of the firing on Sumter until I\r\nstarted East, about the first of September, 1861, I was deeply\r\nsolicitous as to the course of events, and though I felt confident\r\nthat in the end the just cause of the Government must triumph, yet\r\nthe thoroughly crystallized organization which the Southern\r\nConfederacy quickly exhibited disquieted me very much, for it alone\r\nwas evidence that the Southern leaders had long anticipated the\r\nstruggle and prepared for it.  It was very difficult to obtain direct\r\nintelligence of the progress of the war.  Most of the time we were in\r\nthe depths of ignorance as to the true condition of affairs, and this\r\ntended to increase our anxiety.  Then, too, the accounts of the\r\nconflicts that had taken place were greatly exaggerated by the\r\nEastern papers, and lost nothing in transition.  The news came by the\r\npony express across the Plains to San Francisco, where it was still\r\nfurther magnified in republishing, and gained somewhat in Southern\r\nbias.  I remember well that when the first reports reached us of, the\r\nbattle of Bull Run--that sanguinary engagement--it was stated that\r\neach side had lost forty thousand men in killed and wounded, and none\r\nwere reported missing nor as having run away.  Week by week these\r\nlosses grew less, until they finally shrunk into the hundreds, but\r\nthe vivid descriptions of the gory conflict were not toned down\r\nduring the whole summer.\r\n\r\nWe received our mail at Yamhill only once a week, and then had to\r\nbring it from Portland, Oregon, by express.  On the day of the week\r\nthat our courier, or messenger, was expected back from Portland, I\r\nwould go out early in the morning to a commanding point above the\r\npost, from which I could see a long distance down the road as it ran\r\nthrough the valley of the Yamhill, and there I would watch with\r\nanxiety for his coming, longing for good news; for, isolated as I had\r\nbeen through years spent in the wilderness, my patriotism was\r\nuntainted by politics, nor had it been disturbed by any discussion of\r\nthe questions out of which the war grew, and I hoped for the success\r\nof the Government above all other considerations.  I believe I was\r\nalso uninfluenced by any thoughts of the promotion that might result\r\nto me from the conflict, but, out of a sincere desire to contribute\r\nas much as I could to the preservation of the Union, I earnestly\r\nwished to be at the seat of war, and feared it might end before I\r\ncould get East.  In no sense did I anticipate what was to happen to\r\nme afterward, nor that I was to gain any distinction from it.  I was\r\nready to do my duty to the best of my ability wherever I might be\r\ncalled, and I was young, healthy, insensible to fatigue, and desired\r\nopportunity, but high rank was so distant in our service that not a\r\ndream of its attainment had flitted through my brain.\r\n\r\nDuring the period running from January to September, 1861, in\r\nconsequence of resignations and the addition of some new regiments to\r\nthe regular army, I had passed through the grade of first lieutenant\r\nand reached that of captain in the Thirteenth United States Infantry,\r\nof which General W. T. Sherman had recently been made the colonel.\r\nWhen relieved from further duty at Yamhill by Captain Owen, I left\r\nfor the Atlantic coast to join my new regiment.  A two days' ride\r\nbrought me down to Portland, whence I sailed to San Franciso, and at\r\nthat city took passage by steamer for New York via the Isthmus of\r\nPanama, in company with a number of officers who were coming East\r\nunder circumstances like my own.\r\n\r\nAt this time California was much agitated--on the question of\r\nsecession, and the secession element was so strong that considerable\r\napprehension was felt by the Union people lest the State might be\r\ncarried into the Confederacy.  As a consequence great distrust\r\nexisted in all quarters, and the loyal passengers on the steamer, not\r\nknowing what might occur during our voyage, prepared to meet\r\nemergencies by thoroughly organizing to frustrate any attempt that\r\nmight possibly be made to carry us into some Southern port after we\r\nshould leave Aspinwall.  However, our fears proved groundless; at all\r\nevents, no such attempt was made, and we reached New York in safety\r\nin November, 1861.  A day or two in New York sufficed to replenish a\r\nmost meagre wardrobe, and I then started West to join my new\r\nregiment, stopping a day and a night at the home of my parents in\r\nOhio, where I had not been since I journeyed from Texas for the\r\nPacific coast.  The headquarters of my regiment were at Jefferson\r\nBarracks, Missouri, to which point I proceeded with no further delay\r\nexcept a stay in the city of St. Louis long enough to pay my respects\r\nto General H. W. Halleck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nAUDITING ACCOUNTS--CHIEF QUARTERMASTER AND COMMISSARY OF THE ARMY OF\r\nSOUTHWEST MISSOURI--PREPARING FOR THE PEA RIDGE CAMPAIGN--A\r\nDIFFERENCE WITH GENERAL CURTIS--ORDERED TO THE FRONT--APPOINTED A\r\nCOLONEL.\r\n\r\nSome days after I had reached the headquarters of my regiment near\r\nSt. Louis, General Halleck sent for me, and when I reported he\r\ninformed me that there existed a great deal of confusion regarding\r\nthe accounts of some of the disbursing officers in his department,\r\nwhose management of its fiscal affairs under his predecessor, General\r\nJohn C. Fremont, had been very loose; and as the chaotic condition of\r\nthings could be relieved only by auditing these accounts, he\r\ntherefore had determined to create a board of officers for the\r\npurpose, and intended to make me president of it.  The various\r\ntransactions in question covered a wide field, for the department\r\nembraced the States of Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois, Arkansas,\r\nand all of Kentucky west of the Cumberland River.\r\n\r\nThe duty was not distasteful, and I felt that I was qualified to\r\nundertake it, for the accounts to be audited belonged exclusively to\r\nthe Quartermaster and Subsistence departments, and by recent\r\nexperience I had become familiar with the class of papers that\r\npertained to those branches of the army.  Indeed, it was my\r\nfamiliarity with such transactions, returns, etc., that probably\r\ncaused my selection as president of the board.\r\n\r\nI entered upon the work forthwith, and continued at it until the 26th\r\nof December, 1861.  At that date I was relieved from the auditing\r\nboard and assigned to duty as Chief Commissary of the Army of\r\nSouthwest Missouri, commanded by General Samuel R. Curtis.  This army\r\nwas then organizing at Rolla, Missouri, for the Pea Ridge campaign,\r\nits strength throughout the campaign being in the aggregate about\r\nfifteen thousand men.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I received information of my selection for this position,\r\nI went to General Halleck and requested him to assign me as Chief\r\nQuartermaster also.  He was reluctant to do so, saying that I could\r\nnot perform both duties, but I soon convinced him that I could do\r\nboth better than the one, for I reminded him that as Chief\r\nQuartermaster I should control the transportation, and thus obviate\r\nall possible chances of discord between the two staff departments; a\r\ncondition which I deemed essential to success, especially as it was\r\nintended that Curtis's army should mainly subsist on the country.\r\nThis argument impressed Halleck, and becoming convinced, he promptly\r\nissued the order making me Chief Quartermaster and Chief Commissary\r\nof Subsistence of the Army of Southwest Missouri, and I started for\r\nRolla to enter upon the work assigned me.\r\n\r\nHaving reported to General Curtis, I quickly learned that his system\r\nof supply was very defective, and the transportation without proper\r\norganization, some of the regiments having forty to fifty wagon each,\r\nand others only three or four.  I labored day and night to remedy\r\nthese and other defects, and with the help of Captain Michael P.\r\nSmall, of the Subsistence Department, who was an invaluable\r\nassistant, soon brought things into shape, putting the transportation\r\nin good working order, giving each regiment its proper quota of\r\nwagons, and turning the surplus into the general supply trains of the\r\narmy.  In accomplishing this I was several times on the verge of\r\npersonal conflict with irate regimental commanders, but Colonel G. M.\r\nDodge so greatly sustained me with General Curtis by strong moral\r\nsupport, and by such efficient details from his regiment--the Fourth\r\nIowa Volunteer Infantry--that I still bear him and it great affection\r\nand lasting gratitude.\r\n\r\nOn January 26, 1862, General Curtis's army began its march from Rolla\r\nto Springfield, Missouri, by way of Lebanon.  The roads were deep\r\nwith mud, and so badly cut up that the supply trains in moving\r\nlabored under the most serious difficulties, and were greatly\r\nembarrassed by swollen streams.  Under these circumstances many\r\ndelays occurred, and when we arrived at Lebanon nearly all the\r\nsupplies with which we had started had been consumed, and the work of\r\nfeeding the troops off the country had to begin at that point.  To\r\nget flour, wheat had to be taken from the stacks, threshed, and sent\r\nto the mills to be ground.  Wheat being scarce in this region, corn\r\nas a substitute had to be converted into meal by the same laborious\r\nprocess.  In addition, beef cattle had to be secured for the meat\r\nration.\r\n\r\nBy hard work we soon accumulated a sufficient quantity of flour and\r\ncorn meal to justify the resumption of our march on Springfield; at\r\nor near which point the enemy was believed to be awaiting us, and the\r\norder was given to move forward, the commanding general cautioning\r\nme, in the event of disaster, to let no salt fall into General\r\nPrice's hands.  General Curtis made a hobby of this matter of salt,\r\nbelieving the enemy was sadly in need of that article, and he\r\nimpressed me deeply with his conviction that our cause would be\r\nseriously injured by a loss which would inure so greatly and\r\npeculiarly to the enemy's benefit; but we afterward discovered, when\r\nPrice abandoned his position, that about all he left behind was salt.\r\n\r\nWhen we were within about eight miles of Springfield, General Curtis\r\ndecided to put his troops in line of battle for the advance on the\r\ntown, and directed me to stretch out my supply trains in a long line\r\nof battle, so that in falling back, in case the troops were repulsed,\r\nhe could rally the men on the wagons.  I did not like the tactics,\r\nbut of course obeyed the order.  The line moved on Springfield, and\r\ntook the town without resistance, the enemy having fled southward, in\r\nthe direction of Pea Ridge, the preceding day.  Of course our success\r\nrelieved my anxiety about the wagons; but fancy has often pictured\r\nsince, the stampede of six mule teams that, had we met with any\r\nreverse, would have taken place over the prairies of southwest\r\nMissouri.\r\n\r\nThe army set out in pursuit of Price, but I was left at Springfield\r\nto gather supplies from the surrounding country, by the same means\r\nthat had been used at Lebanon, and send them forward.  To succeed in\r\nthis useful and necessary duty required much hard work.  To procure\r\nthe grain and to run the mills in the country, replacing the\r\nmachinery where parts had been carried away, or changing the\r\nprinciple and running the mills on some different plan when\r\nnecessary, and finally forward the product to the army, made a task\r\nthat taxed the energy of all engaged in it.  Yet, having at command a\r\nvery skillful corps of millwrights, machinists, and millers, detailed\r\nprincipally from the Fourth Iowa and Thirty-sixth Illinois volunteer\r\nregiments, we soon got matters in shape, and were able to send such\r\nlarge quantities of flour and meal to the front, that only the bacon\r\nand small parts of the ration had to be brought forward from our\r\ndepot at Rolla.  When things were well systematized, I went forward\r\nmyself to expedite the delivery of supplies, and joined the army at\r\nCross Hollows, just south of Pea Ridge.\r\n\r\nFinding everything working well at Cross Hollows, I returned to\r\nSpringfield in a few days to continue the labor of collecting\r\nsupplies.  On my way back I put the mills at Cassville in good order\r\nto grind the grain in that vicinity, and perfected there a plan for\r\nthe general supply from the neighboring district of both the men and\r\nanimals of the army, so that there should, be no chance of a failure\r\nof the campaign from bad roads or disaster to my trains.  Springfield\r\nthus became the centre of the entire supply section.\r\n\r\nJust after my return to Springfield the battle of Pea Ridge was\r\nfought.  The success of the Union troops in this battle was\r\nconsiderable, and while not of sufficient magnitude to affect the\r\ngeneral cause materially, it was decisive as to that particular\r\ncampaign, and resulted in driving all organized Confederate forces\r\nout of the State of Missouri.  After Pea Ridge was won, certain\r\nefforts were made to deprive Curtis of the credit due him for the\r\nvictory; but, no matter what merit belonged to individual commanders,\r\nI was always convinced that Curtis was deserving of the highest\r\ncommendation, not only for the skill displayed on the field, but for\r\na zeal and daring in campaign which was not often exhibited at that\r\nearly period of the war.  Especially should this credit be awarded\r\nhim, when we consider the difficulties under which he labored, how he\r\nwas hampered in having to depend on a sparsely settled country for\r\nthe subsistence of his troops.  In the reports of the battle that\r\ncame to Springfield, much glory was claimed for some other general\r\nofficers, but as I had control of the telegraph line from Springfield\r\neast, I detained all despatches until General Curtis had sent in his\r\nofficial report.  He thus had the opportunity of communicating with\r\nhis superior in advance of some of his vain subordinates, who would\r\nhave laid claim to the credit of the battle had I not thwarted them\r\nby this summary means.\r\n\r\nNot long afterward came the culmination of a little difference that\r\nhad arisen between General Curtis and me, brought about, I have since\r\nsometimes thought, by an assistant quartermaster from Iowa, whom I\r\nhad on duty with me at Springfield.  He coveted my place, and finally\r\nsucceeded in getting it.  He had been an unsuccessful banker in Iowa,\r\nand early in the war obtained an appointment as assistant\r\nquartermaster of volunteers with the rank of captain.  As chief\r\nquartermaster of the army in Missouri, there would be opportunities\r\nfor the recuperation of his fortunes which would not offer to one in\r\na subordinate place; so to gain this position he doubtless intrigued\r\nfor it while under my eye, and Curtis was induced to give it to him\r\nas soon as I was relieved.  His career as my successor, as well as in\r\nother capacities in which he was permitted to act during the war, was\r\nto say the least not savory.  The war over he turned up in Chicago as\r\npresident of a bank, which he wrecked; and he finally landed in the\r\npenitentiary for stealing a large sum of money from the United States\r\nTreasury at Washington while employed there as a clerk.  The chances\r\nthat this man's rascality would be discovered were much less when\r\nchief of the departments of transportation and supply of an army than\r\nthey afterward proved to be in the Treasury.  I had in my possession\r\nat all times large sums of money for the needs of the army, and among\r\nother purposes for which these funds were to be disbursed was the\r\npurchase of horses and mules.  Certain officers and men more devoted\r\nto gain than to the performance of duty (a few such are always to be\r\nfound in armies) quickly learned this, and determined to profit by\r\nit.  Consequently they began a regular system of stealing horses from\r\nthe people of the country and proffering them to me for purchase.  It\r\ntook but a little time to discover this roguery, and when I became\r\nsatisfied of their knavery I brought it to a sudden close by seizing\r\nthe horses as captured property, branding them U. S., and refusing to\r\npay for them.  General Curtis, misled by the misrepresentations that\r\nhad been made, and without fully knowing the circumstances, or\r\nrealizing to what a base and demoralizing state of things this course\r\nwas inevitably tending, practically ordered me to make the Payments,\r\nand I refused.  The immediate result of this disobedience was a\r\ncourt-martial to try me; and knowing that my usefulness in that army\r\nwas gone, no matter what the outcome of the trial might be, I asked\r\nGeneral Halleck to relieve me from duty with General Curtis and order\r\nme to St. Louis.  This was promptly done, and as my connection with\r\nthe Army of Southwest Missouri was thus severed before the court\r\ncould be convened, my case never came to trial.  The man referred to\r\nas being the cause of this condition of affairs was appointed by\r\nGeneral Curtis to succeed me.  I turned over to the former all the\r\nfunds and property for which I was responsible, also the branded\r\nhorses and mules stolen from the people of the country, requiring\r\nreceipts for everything.  I heard afterward that some of the blooded\r\nstock of southwest Missouri made its way to Iowa in an unaccountable\r\nmanner, but whether the administration of my successor was\r\nresponsible for it or not I am unable to say.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival at St. Louis I felt somewhat forlorn and disheartened\r\nat the turn affairs had taken.  I did not know where I should be\r\nassigned, nor what I should be required to do, but these\r\nuncertainties were dispelled in a few days by General Halleck, who,\r\nbeing much pressed by the Governors of some of the Western States to\r\ndisburse money in their sections, sent me out into the Northwest with\r\na sort of roving commission to purchase horses for the use of the\r\narmy.  I went to Madison and Racine, Wis., at which places I bought\r\ntwo hundred horses, which were shipped to St. Louis.  At Chicago I\r\nbought two hundred more, and as the prices paid at the latter point\r\nshowed that Illinois was the cheapest market--it at that time\r\nproducing a surplus over home demands--I determined to make Chicago\r\nthe centre of my operations.\r\n\r\nWhile occupied in this way at Chicago the battle of Shiloh took\r\nplace, and the desire for active service with troops became uppermost\r\nin my thoughts, so I returned to St. Louis to see if I could not get\r\ninto the field.  General Halleck having gone down to the Shiloh\r\nbattle-field, I reported to his Assistant Adjutant-General, Colonel\r\nJohn C. Kelton, and told him of my anxiety to take a hand in active\r\nfield-service, adding that I did not wish to join my regiment, which\r\nwas still organizing and recruiting at Jefferson Barracks, for I felt\r\nconfident I could be more useful elsewhere.  Kelton knew that the\r\npurchasing duty was but temporary, and that on its completion,\r\nprobably at no distant date, I should have to join my company at the\r\nbarracks; so, realizing the inactivity to which that situation of\r\naffairs would subject me, he decided to assume the responsibility of\r\nsending me to report to General Halleck at Shiloh, and gave me an\r\norder to that effect.\r\n\r\nThis I consider the turning-point in my military career, and shall\r\nalways feel grateful to Colonel Kelton for his kindly act which so\r\ngreatly influenced my future.  My desire to join the army at Shiloh\r\nhad now taken possession of me, and I was bent on getting there by\r\nthe first means available.  Learning that a hospital-boat under\r\ncharge of Dr. Hough was preparing to start for Pittsburg Landing, I\r\nobtained the Doctor's consent to take passage on it, and on the\r\nevening of April 15, I left St. Louis for the scene of military\r\noperations in northeastern Mississippi.\r\n\r\nAt Pittsburg Landing I reported to General Halleck, who, after some\r\nslight delay, assigned me to duty as an assistant to Colonel George\r\nThom, of the topographical engineers.  Colonel Thom put me at the\r\nwork of getting the trains up from the landing, which involved the\r\nrepair of roads for that purpose by corduroying the marshy places.\r\nThis was rough, hard work, without much chance of reward, but it, was\r\nnear the field of active operations, and I determined to do the best\r\nI could at it till opportunity for something better might arise.\r\n\r\nGeneral Halleck did not know much about taking care of himself in the\r\nfield.  His camp arrangements were wholly inadequate, and in\r\nconsequence he and all the officers about him were subjected to much\r\nunnecessary discomfort and annoyance.  Someone suggested to him to\r\nappoint me quartermaster for his headquarters, with a view to\r\nsystematizing the establishment and remedying the defects complained\r\nof, and I was consequently assigned to this duty.  Shortly after this\r\nassignment I had the satisfaction of knowing that General Halleck was\r\ndelighted with the improvements made at headquarters, both in camp\r\noutfit and transportation, and in administration generally.  My\r\npopularity grew as the improvements increased, but one trifling\r\nincident came near marring it.  There was some hitch about getting\r\nfresh beef for General Halleck's mess, and as by this time everybody\r\nhad come to look to me for anything and everything in the way of\r\ncomfort, Colonel Joe McKibben brought an order from the General for\r\nme to get fresh beef for the headquarters mess.  I was not caterer\r\nfor this mess, nor did I belong to it even, so I refused point-blank.\r\nMcKibben, disliking to report my disobedience, undertook persuasion,\r\nand brought Colonel Thom to see me to aid in his negotiations, but I\r\nwould not give in, so McKibben in the kindness of his heart rode\r\nseveral miles in order to procure the beef himself, and thus save me\r\nfrom the dire results which he thought would follow should Halleck\r\nget wind of such downright insubordination.  The next day I was made\r\nCommissary of Subsistence for the headquarters in addition to my\r\nother duties, and as this brought me into the line of fresh beef,\r\nGeneral Halleck had no cause thereafter to complain of a scarcity of\r\nthat article in his mess.\r\n\r\nMy stay at General Halleck's headquarters was exceedingly agreeable,\r\nand my personal intercourse with officers on duty there was not only\r\npleasant and instructive, but offered opportunities for improvement\r\nand advancement for which hardly any other post could have afforded\r\nlike chances.  My special duties did not occupy all my time, and\r\nwhenever possible I used to go over to General Sherman's division,\r\nwhich held the extreme right of our line in the advance on Corinth,\r\nto witness the little engagements occurring there continuously during\r\nthe slow progress which the army was then making, the enemy being\r\nforced back but a short distance each day.  I knew General Sherman\r\nvery well.  We came from near the same section of country in Ohio,\r\nand his wife and her family had known me from childhood.  I was\r\nalways kindly received by the General, and one day he asked me if I\r\nwould be willing to accept the colonelcy of a certain Ohio regiment\r\nif he secured the appointment.  I gladly told him yes, if General\r\nHalleck would let me go; but I was doomed to disappointment, for in\r\nabout a week or so afterward General Sherman informed me that the\r\nGovernor of Ohio would not consent, having already decided to appoint\r\nsome one else.\r\n\r\nA little later Governor Blair, of Michigan, who was with the army\r\ntemporarily in the interest of the troops from his State, and who\r\njust at this time was looking around for a colonel for the Second\r\nMichigan Cavalry, and very anxious to get a regular officer, fixed\r\nupon me as the man.  The regiment was then somewhat run down by\r\nlosses from sickness, and considerably split into factions growing\r\nout of jealousies engendered by local differences previous to\r\norganization, and the Governor desired to bridge over all these\r\ntroubles by giving the regiment a commander who knew nothing about\r\nthem.  I presume that some one said to the Governor about this time,\r\n\"Why don't you get Sheridan?\"  This, however, is only conjecture.  I\r\nreally do not know how my name was proposed to him, but I have often\r\nbeen told since that General Gordon Granger, whom I knew slightly\r\nthen, and who had been the former colonel of the regiment, first\r\nsuggested the appointment.  At all events, on the morning of May 27,\r\n1862, Captain Russell A. Alger--recently Governor of Michigan\r\n--accompanied by the quartermaster of the regiment, Lieutenant Frank\r\nWalbridge, arrived at General Halleck's headquarters and delivered to\r\nme this telegram:\r\n\r\n(By Telegraph.)\r\n\"MILITARY DEPT OF MICHIGAN,\r\n\"ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,\r\n\"DETROIT, May 25, 1862.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDERS NO. 148.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Philip H. Sheridan, U. S. Army, is hereby appointed\r\nColonel of the Second Regiment Michigan Cavalry, to rank from\r\nthis date.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Sheridan will immediately assume command of the\r\nregiment.\r\n\r\n\"By order of the Commander-in-Chief,\r\n\"JNO. ROBERTSON,\r\n\"Adjutant-General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI took the order to General Halleck, and said that I would like to\r\naccept, but he was not willing I should do so until the consent of\r\nthe War Department could be obtained.  I returned to my tent much\r\ndisappointed, for in those days, for some unaccountable reason, the\r\nWar Department did not favor the appointment of regular officers to\r\nvolunteer regiments, and I feared a disapproval at Washington.  After\r\na further consultation with Captain Alger and Lieutenant Walbridge, I\r\ndetermined to go to the General again and further present the case.\r\nEnlarging on my desire for active service with troops, and urging the\r\nutter lack of such opportunity where I was, I pleaded my cause until\r\nGeneral Halleck finally resolved to take the responsibility of\r\nletting me go without consulting the War Department.  When I had\r\nthanked him for the kindness, he said that inasmuch as I was to leave\r\nhim, he would inform me that the regiment to which I had just been\r\nappointed was ordered out as part of a column directed to make a raid\r\nto the south of the enemy, then occupying Corinth, and that if I\r\ncould turn over my property, it would probably be well for me to join\r\nmy command immediately, so that I could go with the expedition.  I\r\nreturned to my tent, where Alger and Walbridge were still waiting,\r\nand told them of the success of my interview, at the same time\r\nnotifying them that I would join the regiment in season to accompany\r\nthe expedition of which Halleck had spoken.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the afternoon I turned over all my property to my\r\nsuccessor, and about 8 o'clock that evening made my appearance at the\r\ncamp of the Second Michigan Cavalry, near Farmington, Mississippi.\r\nThe regiment was in a hubbub of excitement making preparations for\r\nthe raid, and I had barely time to meet the officers of my command,\r\nand no opportunity at all to see the men, when the trumpet sounded to\r\nhorse.  Dressed in a coat and trousers of a captain of infantry, but\r\nrecast as a colonel of cavalry by a pair of well-worn eagles that\r\nGeneral Granger had kindly given me, I hurriedly placed on my saddle\r\na haversack, containing some coffee, sugar, bacon, and hard bread,\r\nwhich had been prepared, and mounting my horse, I reported my\r\nregiment to the brigade commander as ready for duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nEXPEDITION TO BOONEVILLE--DESTROYING SUPPLIES--CONFEDERATE\r\nSTRAGGLERS--SUCCESS OF THE EXPEDITION--A RECONNOISSANCE--THE\r\nIMPORTANCE OF BODILY SUSTENANCE--THE BATTLE OF BOONEVILLE\r\n--RECOMMENDED FOR APPOINTMENT AS A BRIGADIER-GENERAL.\r\n\r\nThe expedition referred to by General Halleck in his parting\r\nconversation was composed of the Second Michigan and Second Iowa\r\nregiments of cavalry, formed into a brigade under command of Colonel\r\nWashington L. Elliott, of the Second Iowa.  It was to start on the\r\nnight of the 27th of May at 12 o'clock, and proceed by a circuitous\r\nroute through Iuka, Miss., to Booneville, a station on the Mobile and\r\nOhio Railroad, about twenty-two miles below Corinth, and accomplish\r\nall it could in the way of destroying the enemy's supplies and\r\ncutting his railroad communications.\r\n\r\nThe weather in that climate was already warm, guides unobtainable,\r\nand both men and horses suffered much discomfort from the heat, and\r\nfatigue from the many delays growing out of the fact that we were in\r\nalmost total ignorance of the roads leading to the point that we\r\ndesired to reach.  In order that we might go light we carried only\r\nsugar, coffee, and salt, depending on the country for meat and bread.\r\nBoth these articles were scarce, but I think we got all there was,\r\nfor our advent was so unexpected by the people of the region through\r\nwhich we passed that, supposing us to be Confederate cavalry, they\r\noften gave us all they had, the women and servants contributing most\r\nfreely from their, reserve stores.\r\n\r\nBefore reaching Booneville I had the advance, but just as we arrived\r\non the outskirts of the town the brigade was formed with the Second\r\nIowa on my right, and the whole force moved forward, right in front,\r\npreceded by skirmishers.  Here we encountered the enemy, but forced\r\nhim back with little resistance.  When we had gained possession of\r\nthe station, Colonel Elliott directed me to take the left wing of my\r\nregiment, pass to the south, and destroy a bridge or culvert supposed\r\nto be at a little distance below the town on the Mobile and Ohio\r\nRailroad.  The right wing, or other half of the regiment, was to be\r\nheld in reserve for my support if necessary.  I moved rapidly in the\r\ndesignated direction till I reached the railroad, and then rode down\r\nit for a mile and a half, but found neither bridge nor culvert.  I\r\nthen learned that there was no bridge of any importance except the\r\none at Baldwin, nine miles farther down, but as I was aware, from\r\ninformation recently received, that it was defended by three\r\nregiments and a battery, I concluded that I could best accomplish the\r\npurpose for which I had been detached--crippling the road--by tearing\r\nup the track, bending the rails, and burning the cross-ties.  This\r\nwas begun with alacrity at four different points, officers and men\r\nvieing with one another in the laborious work of destruction.  We had\r\nbut few tools, and as the difficulties to overcome were serious, our\r\nprogress was slow, until some genius conceived the idea that the\r\ntrack, rails and ties, might be lifted from its bed bodily, turned\r\nover, and subjected to a high heat; a convenient supply of dry\r\nfence-rails would furnish ample fuel to render the rails useless.\r\nIn this way a good deal of the track was effectively broken up, and\r\ncommunication by rail from Corinth to the south entirely cut off.\r\nWhile we were still busy in wrecking the road, a dash was made at my\r\nright and rear by a squadron of Confederate cavalry.  This was\r\nhandsomely met by the reserve under Captain Archibald P. Campbell, of\r\nthe Second Michigan, who, dismounting a portion of his command,\r\nreceived the enemy with such a volley from his Colt's repeating\r\nrifles that the squadron broke and fled in all directions.  We were\r\nnot molested further, and resumed our work, intending to extend the\r\nbreak toward Baldwin, but receiving orders from Elliott to return to\r\nBooneville immediately, the men were recalled, and we started to\r\nrejoin the main command.\r\n\r\nIn returning to Booneville, I found the railroad track above where I\r\nhad struck it blocked by trains that we had thus cut off, and the\r\nwoods and fields around the town covered with several thousand\r\nConfederate soldiers.  These were mostly convalescents and\r\ndisheartened stragglers belonging to General Beauregard's army, and\r\nfrom them we learned that Corinth was being evacuated.  I spent some\r\nlittle time in an endeavor to get these demoralized men into an open\r\nfield, with a view to some future disposition of them; but in the\r\nmidst of the undertaking I received another order from Colonel\r\nElliott to join him at once.  The news of the evacuation had also\r\nreached Elliott, and had disclosed a phase of the situation so\r\ndifferent from that under which he had viewed it when we arrived at\r\nBooneville, that he had grown anxious to withdraw, lest we should be\r\nsuddenly pounced upon by an overwhelming force from some one of the\r\ncolumns in retreat.  Under such circumstances my prisoners would\r\nprove a decided embarrassment, so I abandoned further attempts to get\r\nthem together--not even paroling them, which I thought might have\r\nbeen done with but little risk.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the captured cars had been fired, and as their\r\ncomplete destruction was assured by explosions from those containing\r\nammunition, they needed no further attention, so I withdrew my men\r\nand hastened to join Elliott, taking along some Confederate officers\r\nwhom I had retained from among four or five hundred prisoners\r\ncaptured when making the original dash below the town.\r\n\r\nThe losses in my regiment, and, in fact, those of the entire command,\r\nwere insignificant.  The results of the expedition were important;\r\nthe railroad being broken so thoroughly as to cut off all rolling\r\nstock north of Booneville, and to place at the service of General\r\nHalleck's army the cars and locomotives of which the retreating\r\nConfederates were now so much in need.  In addition, we burned\r\ntwenty-six cars containing ten thousand stand of small arms, three\r\npieces of artillery, a great quantity of clothing, a heavy supply of\r\nammunition, and the personal baggage of General Leonidas Polk.  A\r\nlarge number of prisoners, mostly sick and convalescent, also fell\r\ninto our hands; but as we could not carry them with us--such a hurried\r\ndeparture was an immediate necessity, by reason of our critical\r\nsituation--the process of paroling them was not completed, and they\r\ndoubtless passed back to active service in the Confederacy, properly\r\nenough unrecognized as prisoners of war by their superiors.\r\n\r\nIn returning, the column marched back by another indirect route to\r\nits old camp near Farmington, where we learned that the whole army\r\nhad moved into and beyond Corinth, in pursuit of Beauregard, on the\r\n13th of May, the very day we had captured Booneville.  Although we\r\nhad marched about one hundred and eighty miles in four days, we were\r\nrequired to take part, of course, in the pursuit of the Confederate\r\narmy.  So, resting but one night in our old camp, we were early in\r\nthe saddle again on the morning of the 2d of June.  Marching south\r\nthrough Corinth, we passed on the 4th of June the scene of our late\r\nraid, viewing with much satisfaction, as we took the road toward\r\nBlackland, the still smoldering embers of the burned trains.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of June I was ordered to proceed with my regiment along\r\nthe Blackland road to determine the strength of the enemy in that\r\ndirection, as it was thought possible we might capture, by a\r\nconcerted movement which General John Pope had suggested to General\r\nHalleck, a portion of Beauregard's rear guard.  Pushing the\r\nConfederate scouts rapidly in with a running fire for a mile or more,\r\nwhile we were approaching a little stream, I hoped to gobble the main\r\nbody of the enemy's pickets.  I therefore directed the sabre\r\nbattalion of the regiment, followed by that portion of it armed with\r\nrevolving rifles, to dash forward in column, cut off these videttes\r\nbefore they could cross the stream, and then gather them in.  The\r\npickets fled hastily, however, and a pell-mell pursuit carried us\r\nover the stream at their heels by a little bridge, with no thought of\r\nhalting till we gained a hill on the other side, and suddenly found\r\nourselves almost in the camp of a strong body of artillery and\r\ninfantry.  Captain Campbell being in advance, hurriedly dismounted\r\nhis battalion for a further forward movement on foot, but it was\r\nreadily seen that the enemy was present in such heavy force as almost\r\nto ensure our destruction, and I gave orders for a hasty withdrawal.\r\nWe withdrew without loss under cover of thick woods, aided much,\r\nhowever, by the consternation of the Confederates, who had hardly\r\nrecovered from their surprise at our sudden appearance in their camp\r\nbefore we had again placed the stream between them and us by\r\nrecrossing the bridge.  The reconnoissance was a success in one way\r\n--that is, in finding out that the enemy was at the point supposed by,\r\nGeneral Pope; but it also had a tendency to accelerate Beauregard's\r\nretreat, for in a day or two his whole line fell back as far south as\r\nGuntown, thus rendering abortive the plans for bagging a large\r\nportion of his army.\r\n\r\nGeneral Beauregard's evacuation of Corinth and retreat southward were\r\naccomplished in the face of a largely superior force of Union troops,\r\nand he reached the point where he intended to halt for reorganization\r\nwithout other loss than that sustained in the destruction of the cars\r\nand supplies at Booneville, and the capture of some stragglers and\r\ndeserters that fell into our hands while we were pressing his rear\r\nfrom General Pope's flank.  The number of these was quite large, and\r\nindicated that the enemy was considerably demoralized.  Under such\r\ncircumstances, an energetic and skillfully directed pursuit might not\r\nhave made certain the enemy's destruction, but it would largely have\r\naided in disintegrating his forces, and I never could quite\r\nunderstand why it was not ordered.  The desultory affairs between\r\nrear and advance guards seemed as a general, thing to have no\r\nparticular purpose in view beyond finding out where the enemy was,\r\nand when he was found, since no supporting colums were at hand and no\r\none in supreme control was present to give directions, our\r\nskirmishing was of little avail and brought but small reward.\r\n\r\nA short time subsequent to these occurrences, Colonel Elliott was\r\nmade a brigadier-general, and as General Pope appointed him his\r\nChief-of-Staff, I, on the 11th of June, 1862, fell in command of the\r\nbrigade by seniority.  For the rest of the month but little of moment\r\noccurred, and we settled down into camp at Booneville on the 26th of\r\nJune, in a position which my brigade had been ordered to take up some\r\ntwenty miles, in advance of the main army for the purpose of covering\r\nits front.  Although but a few days had elapsed from the date of my\r\nappointment as colonel of the Second Michigan to that of my\r\nsucceeding to the command of the brigade, I believe I can say with\r\npropriety that I had firmly established myself in the confidence of\r\nthe officers and men of the regiment, and won their regard by\r\nthoughtful care.  I had striven unceasingly to have them well fed and\r\nwell clothed, had personally looked after the selection of their\r\ncamps, and had maintained such a discipline as to allay former\r\nirritation.\r\n\r\nMen who march, scout, and fight, and suffer all the hardships that\r\nfall to the lot of soldiers in the field, in order to do vigorous\r\nwork must have the best bodily sustenance, and every comfort that can\r\nbe provided.  I knew from practical experience on the frontier that\r\nmy efforts in this direction would not only be appreciated, but\r\nrequited by personal affection and gratitude; and, further, that such\r\nexertions would bring the best results to me.  Whenever my authority\r\nwould permit I saved my command from needless sacrifices and\r\nunnecessary toil; therefore, when hard or daring work was to be done\r\nI expected the heartiest response, and always got it.  Soldiers are\r\naverse to seeing their comrades killed without compensating results,\r\nand none realize more quickly than they the blundering that often\r\ntakes place on the field of battle.  They want some tangible\r\nindemnity for the loss of life, and as victory is an offset the value\r\nof which is manifest, it not only makes them content to shed their\r\nblood, but also furnishes evidence of capacity in those who command\r\nthem.  My regiment had lost very few men since coming under my\r\ncommand, but it seemed, in the eyes of all who belonged to it, that\r\ncasualties to the enemy and some slight successes for us had repaid\r\nevery sacrifice, and in consequence I had gained not only their\r\nconfidence as soldiers, but also their esteem and love as men, and to\r\na degree far beyond what I then realized.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the camp of my brigade was pitched at Booneville, I began\r\nto scout in every direction, to obtain a knowledge of the enemy's\r\nwhereabouts and learn the ground about me.  My standing in drawing at\r\nthe Military Academy had never been so high as to warrant the belief\r\nthat I could ever prove myself an expert, but a few practical lessons\r\nin that line were impressed on me there, and I had retained enough to\r\nenable me to make rough maps that could be readily understood, and\r\nwhich would be suitable to replace the erroneous skeleton outlines of\r\nnorthern Mississippi, with which at this time we were scantily\r\nfurnished; so as soon as possible I compiled for the use of myself\r\nand my regimental commanders an information map of the surrounding\r\ncountry.  This map exhibited such details as country roads, streams,\r\nfarmhouses, fields, woods, and swamps, and such other topographical\r\nfeatures as would be useful.  I must confess that my crude sketch did\r\nnot evidence much artistic merit, but it was an improvement on what\r\nwe already possessed in the way of details to guide the command, and\r\nthis was what I most needed; for it was of the first importance that\r\nin our exposed condition we should be equipped with a thorough\r\nknowledge of the section in which we were operating, so as to be\r\nprepared to encounter an enemy already indicating recovery from the\r\ndisorganizing effects of his recent retreat.\r\n\r\nIn the immediate vicinity of Booneville the country was covered with\r\nheavy forests, with here and there clearings or intervening fields\r\nthat had been devoted to the cultivation of cotton and corn.  The\r\nground was of a low character, typical of northeastern Mississippi,\r\nand abounded in small creeks that went almost totally dry even in\r\nshort periods of drought, but became flooded with muddy water under\r\nthe outpouring of rain peculiar to a semi-tropical climate.  In such\r\na region there were many chances of our being surprised, especially\r\nby an enemy who knew the country well, and whose ranks were filled\r\nwith local guides; and great precautions as well as the fullest\r\ninformation were necessary to prevent disaster.  I therefore\r\nendeavored to familiarize all with our surroundings, but scarcely had\r\nmatters begun to shape themselves as I desired when our annihilation\r\nwas attempted by a large force of Confederate cavalry.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of July 1, 1862, a cavalry command of between five and\r\nsix thousand-men, under the Confederate General James R. Chalmers,\r\nadvanced on two roads converging near Booneville.  The head of the\r\nenemy's column on the Blackland and Booneville road came in contact\r\nwith my pickets three miles and a half west of Booneville.  These\r\npickets, under Lieutenant Leonidas S. Scranton, of the Second\r\nMichigan Cavalry, fell back slowly, taking advantage of every tree or\r\nother cover to fire from till they arrived at the point where the\r\nconverging roads joined.  At this junction there was a strong\r\nposition in the protecting timber, and here Scranton made a firm\r\nstand, being reinforced presently by the few men he had out as\r\npickets on the road to his left, a second company I had sent him from\r\ncamp, and subsequently by three companies more, all now commanded by\r\nCaptain Campbell.  This force was dismounted and formed in line, and\r\nsoon developed that the enemy was present in large numbers.  Up to\r\nthis time Chalmers had shown only the heads of his columns, and we\r\nhad doubts as to his purpose, but now that our resistance forced him\r\nto deploy two regiments on the right and left of the road, it became\r\napparent that he meant business, and that there was no time to lose\r\nin preparing to repel his attack.\r\n\r\nFull information of the situation was immediately sent me, and I\r\ndirected Campbell to hold fast, if possible, till I could support\r\nhim, but if compelled to retire he was authorized to do so slowly,\r\ntaking advantage of every means that fell in his way to prolong the\r\nfighting.  Before this I had stationed one battalion of the Second\r\nIowa in Booneville, but Colonel Edward Hatch, commanding that\r\nregiment, was now directed to leave one company for the protection of\r\nour camp a little to the north of the station, and take the balance\r\nof the Second Iowa, with the battalion in Booneville except two sabre\r\ncompanies, and form the whole in rear of Captain Campbell, to protect\r\nhis flanks and support him by a charge should the enemy break his\r\ndismounted line.\r\n\r\nWhile these preparations were being made, the Confederates attempted\r\nto drive Campbell from his position by a direct attack through an\r\nopen field.  In this they failed, however, for our men, reserving\r\ntheir fire until the enemy came within about thirty yards, then\r\nopened on him with such a shower of bullets from our Colt's rifles\r\nthat it soon became too hot for him, and he was repulsed with\r\nconsiderable loss.  Foiled in this move, Chalmers hesitated to attack\r\nagain in front, but began overlapping both flanks of Campbell's line\r\nby force of numbers, compelling Campbell to retire toward a strong\r\nposition I had selected in his rear for a line on which to make our\r\nmain resistance.  As soon as the enemy saw this withdrawing he again\r\ncharged in front, but was again as gallantly repelled as in the first\r\nassault, although the encounter was for a short time so desperate as\r\nto have the character of a hand-to-hand conflict, several groups of\r\nfriend and foe using on each other the butts of their guns.  At this\r\njuncture the timely arrival of Colonel Hatch with the Second Iowa\r\ngave a breathing-spell to Campbell, and made the Confederates so\r\nchary of further direct attacks that he was enabled to retire; and at\r\nthe same time I found opportunity to make disposition of the\r\nreinforcement to the best advantage possible, placing the Second Iowa\r\non the left of the new line and strengthening Campbell on its right\r\nwith all the men available.\r\n\r\nIn view of his numbers, the enemy soon regained confidence in his\r\nability to overcome us, and in a little while again began his\r\nflanking movements, his right passing around my left flank some\r\ndistance, and approaching our camp and transportation, which I had\r\nforbidden to be moved out to the rear.  Fearing that he would envelop\r\nus and capture the camp and transportation, I determined to take the\r\noffensive.  Remembering a circuitous wood road that I had become\r\nfamiliar with while making the map heretofore mentioned, I concluded\r\nthat the most effective plan would be to pass a small column around\r\nthe enemy's left, by way of this road, and strike his rear by a\r\nmounted charge simultaneously with an advance of our main line on his\r\nfront.  I knew that the attack in rear would be a most hazardous\r\nundertaking, but in the face of such odds as the enemy had the\r\ncondition of affairs was most critical, and could be relieved, only\r\nby a bold and radical change in our tactics; so I at once selected\r\nfour sabre companies, two from the Second Michigan and two from the\r\nSecond Iowa, and placing Captain Alger, of the former regiment, in\r\ncommand of them, I informed him that I expected of them the quick and\r\ndesperate work that is usually imposed on a forlorn hope.\r\n\r\nTo carry out the purpose now in view, I instructed Captain Alger to\r\nfollow the wood road as it led around the left of the enemy's\r\nadvancing forces, to a point where 'it joined the Blackland road,\r\nabout three miles from Booneville, and directed him, upon reaching\r\nthe Blackland road, to turn up it immediately, and charge the rear of\r\nthe enemy's line.  Under no circumstances was he to deploy the\r\nbattalion, but charge in column right through whatever he came upon,\r\nand report to me in front of Booneville, if at all possible for him\r\nto get there.  If he failed to break through the enemy's line, he was\r\nto go ahead as far as he could, and then if any of his men were left,\r\nand he was able to retreat, he was to do so by the same route he had\r\ntaken on his way out.  To conduct him on this perilous service I sent\r\nalong a thin, sallow, tawny-haired Mississippian named Beene, whom I\r\nhad employed as a guide and scout a few days before, on account of\r\nhis intimate knowledge of the roads, from the public thoroughfares\r\ndown to the insignificant by-paths of the neighboring swamps.  With\r\nsuch guidance I felt sure that the column would get to the desired\r\npoint without delay, for there was no danger of its being lost or\r\nmisled by taking any of the many by-roads which traversed the dense\r\nforests through which it would be obliged to pass.  I also informed\r\nAlger that I should take the reserve and join the main line in front\r\nof Booneville for the purpose of making an advance of my whole force,\r\nand that as a signal he must have his men cheer loudly when he struck\r\nthe enemy's rear, in order that my attack might be simultaneous with\r\nhis.\r\n\r\nI gave him one hour to go around and come back through the enemy, and\r\nwhen he started I moved to the front with the balance of the reserve,\r\nto put everything I had into the fight.  This meant an inestimable\r\nadvantage to the enemy in case of our defeat, but our own safety\r\ndemanded the hazard.  All along our attenuated line the fighting was\r\nnow sharp, and the enemy's firing indicated such numerical strength\r\nthat fear of disaster to Alger increased my anxiety terribly as the\r\ntime set for his cheering arrived and no sound of it was heard.\r\n\r\nRelying, however, on the fact that Beene's knowledge of the roads\r\nwould prevent his being led astray, and confident of Alger's\r\ndetermination to accomplish the purpose for which he set out, as soon\r\nas the hour was up I ordered my whole line forward.  Fortunately,\r\njust as this moment a locomotive and two cars loaded with grain for\r\nmy horses ran into Booneville from Corinth.  I say fortunately,\r\nbecause it was well known throughout the command that in the morning,\r\nwhen I first discovered the large numbers of the enemy, I had called\r\nfor assistance; and my troops, now thinking that reinforcements had\r\narrived by rail from Rienzi, where a division of infantry was\r\nencamped, and inspirated by this belief, advanced with renewed\r\nconfidence and wild cheering.  Meantime I had the engineer of the\r\nlocomotive blow his whistle loudly, so that the enemy might also\r\nlearn that a train had come; and from the fact that in a few moments\r\nhe began to give way before our small force, I thought that this\r\nstrategem had some effect.  Soon his men broke, and ran in the utmost\r\ndisorder over the country in every direction.  I found later,\r\nhowever, that his precipitous retreat was due to the pressure on his\r\nleft from the Second Iowa, in concert with the front attack of the\r\nSecond Michigan, and the demoralization wrought in his rear by Alger,\r\nwho had almost entirely accomplished the purpose of his expedition,\r\nthough he had failed to come through, or so near that I could hear\r\nthe signal agreed upon before leaving Booneville.\r\n\r\nAfter Alger had reached and turned up the Blackland road, the first\r\nthing he came across was the Confederate headquarters; the officers\r\nand orderlies about which he captured and sent back some distance to\r\na farm-house.  Continuing on a gallop, he soon struck the rear of the\r\nenemy's line, but was unable to get through; nor did he get near\r\nenough for me to hear his cheering; but as he had made the distance\r\nhe was to travel in the time allotted, his attack and mine were\r\nalmost coincident, and the enemy, stampeded by the charges in front\r\nand rear, fled toward Blackland, with little or no attempt to capture\r\nAlger's command, which might readily have been done.  Alger's\r\ntroopers soon rejoined me at Booneville, minus many hats, having\r\nreturned by their original route.  They had sustained little loss\r\nexcept a few men wounded and a few temporarily missing.  Among these\r\nwas Alger himself, who was dragged from his saddle by the limb of a\r\ntree that, in the excitement of the charge, he was unable to flank.\r\nThe missing had been dismounted in one way or another, and run over\r\nby the enemy in his flight; but they all turned up later, none the\r\nworse except for a few scratches and bruises.\r\n\r\nMy effective strength in this fight was 827 all told, and Alger's\r\ncommand comprised ninety officers and men.  Chalmers's force was\r\ncomposed of six regiments and two battalions, and though I have been\r\nunable to find any returns from which to verify his actual numbers,\r\nyet, from the statements of prisoners and from information obtained\r\nfrom citizens along his line of march, it is safe to say that he had\r\nin the action not less than five-thousand men.  Our casualties were\r\nnot many--forty-one in all.  His loss in killed and wounded was\r\nconsiderable, his most severely wounded--forty men--falling into our\r\nhands, having been left at farm-houses in the vicinity of the\r\nbattlefield.\r\n\r\nThe victory in the face of such odds was most gratifying, and as it\r\njustified my disinclination--in fact, refusal--to retire from\r\nBooneville without fighting (for the purpose of saving my\r\ntransportation, as directed by superior authority when I applied in\r\nthe morning for reinforcements), it was to me particularly grateful.\r\nIt was also very valuable in, view of the fact that it increased the\r\nconfidence between the officers and men of my brigade and me, and\r\ngave us for the balance of the month not only comparative rest, but\r\nentire immunity from the dangers of a renewed effort to gobble my\r\nisolated outpost.  In addition to all this, commendation from my\r\nimmediate superiors was promptly tendered through oral and written\r\ncongratulations; and their satisfaction at the result of the battle\r\ntook definite form a few days later, in the following application for\r\nmy promotion, when, by an expedition to Ripley, Miss., most valuable\r\ninformation as to the enemy's location and plans was captured:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI,\r\n\"JULY 30, 1862.--3.05 P.

Mizner; so I was directed to\r\nwithdraw from my post and go into camp near Rienzi, Mississippi,\r\nwhere I could equally well cover the roads in front of the army, and\r\nalso be near General Asboth's division of infantry, which occupied a\r\nline in rear of the town.  This section of country, being higher and\r\nmore rolling than that in the neighborhood of Booneville, had many\r\nadvantages in the way of better camping-grounds, better grazing and\r\nthe like, but I moved with reluctance, because I feared that my\r\nproximity to Asboth would diminish to a certain extent my\r\nindependence of command.\r\n\r\nGeneral Asboth was a tall, spare, handsome man, with gray mustache\r\nand a fierce look.  He was an educated soldier, of unquestioned\r\ncourage, but the responsibilities of outpost duty bore rather heavily\r\non him, and he kept all hands in a state of constant worry in\r\nanticipation of imaginary attacks.  His ideas of discipline were not\r\nvery rigid either, and as by this time there had been introduced into\r\nmy brigade some better methods than those obtaining when it first\r\nfell to my command, I feared the effect should he, have any control\r\nover it, or meddle with its internal affairs.  However, there was\r\nnothing to do but to move to the place designated, but General\r\nGranger, who still commanded the cavalry division to which the\r\nbrigade belonged, so arranged matters with General Rosecrans, who had\r\nsucceeded to the command of the Army of the Mississippi, that my\r\nindependence was to be undisturbed, except in case of a general\r\nattack by the enemy.\r\n\r\nWe went into camp near Rienzi, July 22, sending back to the general\r\nfield-hospital at Tuscumbia Springs all our sick--a considerable\r\nnumber--stricken down by the malarial influences around Booneville.\r\nIn a few days the fine grazing and abundance of grain for our\r\nexhausted horses brought about their recuperation; and the many large\r\nopen fields in the vicinity gave opportunity for drills and parades,\r\nwhich were much needed.  I turned my attention to those disciplinary\r\nmeasures which, on account of active work in the field, had been\r\nnecessarily neglected since the brigade had arrived at Pittsburg\r\nLanding, in April; and besides, we had been busy in collecting\r\ninformation by scouting parties and otherwise, in prosecution of the\r\npurpose for which we were covering the main army.\r\n\r\nI kept up an almost daily correspondence with General Granger,\r\nconcerning the information obtained by scouts and reconnoitring\r\nparties, and he came often to Rienzi to see me in relation to this\r\nand other matters.  Previously I had not had much personal\r\nassociation with Granger.  While I was at Halleck's headquarters we\r\nmet on one or two occasions, and the day I joined the Second Michigan\r\nat Farmington I saw him for a few moments, but, with such slight\r\nexception, our intercourse had been almost exclusively official.  He\r\nhad suggested my name, I was told, to Governor Blair, when the\r\nGovernor was in search of an officer of the regular army to appoint\r\nto the colonelcy of the Second Michigan Cavalry, but his\r\nrecommendation must have been mainly based on the favorable opinions\r\nhe had heard expressed by General Halleck and by some of the officers\r\nof his staff, rather than from any personal knowledge of my capacity.\r\nOf course I was very grateful for this, but some of his\r\ncharacteristics did not impress me favorably, and I sometimes wished\r\nthe distance between our camps greater.  His most serious failing was\r\nan uncontrollable propensity to interfere with and direct the minor\r\nmatters relating to the command, the details for which those under\r\nhim were alone responsible.  Ill-judged meddling in this respect\r\noften led to differences between us, only temporary it is true, but\r\nmost harassing to the subordinate, since I was compelled by the\r\ncircumstances of the situation not only invariably to yield my own\r\njudgment, but many a time had to play peacemaker--smoothing down\r\nruffled feelings, that I knew had been excited by Granger's freaky\r\nand spasmodic efforts to correct personally some trifling fault that\r\nought to have been left to a regimental or company commander to\r\nremedy.  Yet with all these small blemishes Granger had many good\r\nqualities, and his big heart was so full of generous impulses and\r\ngood motives as to far outbalance his short-comings; and\r\nnot-withstanding the friction and occasional acerbity of our official\r\nintercourse, we maintained friendly relations till his death.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the fatal mistake made by dispersing Halleck's forces\r\nafter the fall of Corinth, General Don Carlos Buell's Army of the\r\nOhio had been started some time before on its march eastward toward\r\nChattanooga; and as this movement would be followed of course by a\r\nmanoeuvre on the part of the enemy, now at Tupelo under General\r\nBraxton Bragg, either to meet Buell or frustrate his designs by some\r\ncounter-operation, I was expected to furnish, by scouting and all\r\nother means available, information as to what was going on within the\r\nConfederate lines.  To do the work required, necessitated an increase\r\nof my command, and the Seventh Kansas Cavalry was therefore added to\r\nit, and my picket-line extended so as to cover from Jacinto\r\nsouthwesterly to a point midway between Rienzi and Booneville, and\r\nthen northwesterly to the Hatchie River.  Skirmishes between outposts\r\non this line were of frequent occurrence, with small results to\r\neither side, but they were somewhat annoying, particularly in the\r\ndirection of Ripley, where the enemy maintained a considerable\r\noutpost.  Deciding to cripple if not capture this outpost, on the\r\nevening of July 27, I sent out an expedition under Colonel Hatch,\r\nwhich drove the enemy from the town of Ripley and took a few\r\nprisoners, but the most valuable prize was in the shape of a package\r\nof thirty-two private letters, the partial reading of which disclosed\r\nto me the positive transfer from Mississippi of most of Bragg's army,\r\nfor the purpose of counteracting Buell's operations in northern\r\nAlabama and East Tennessee.  This decisive evidence was of the utmost\r\nimportance, and without taking time to read all the letters, I\r\nforwarded them to General Granger July 28, in a despatch which\r\nstated: \"I deem it necessary to send them at once; the enemy is\r\nmoving in large force on Chattanooga.\"  Other than this the results\r\nof the expedition were few; and the enemy, having fled from Ripley\r\nwith but slight resistance, accompanied by almost all the\r\ninhabitants, re-occupied the place next day after our people had\r\nquitted it, and resumed in due time his annoying attacks on our\r\noutposts, both sides trying to achieve something whenever occasion\r\noffered.\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of a severe drought had resulted in drying up many of\r\nthe streams within the enemy's lines, and, in consequence, he was\r\nobliged to shift his camps often, and send his beef-cattle and mules\r\nnear his outposts for water.  My scouts kept me well posted in regard\r\nto the movements of both camps and herds; and a favorable opportunity\r\npresenting itself, I sent an expedition on August 14 to gather in\r\nsome animals located on Twenty-Mile Creek, a stream always supplied\r\nwith water from a source of never-failing, springs.  Our side met\r\nwith complete success in this instance, and when the expedition\r\nreturned, we were all made happy by an abundance of fresh beef, and\r\nby some two hundred captured mules, that we thus added to our trains\r\nat a time when draft animals were much needed.\r\n\r\nRations for the men were now supplied in fair quantities, and the\r\nonly thing required to make us wholly contented was plenty of grain\r\nfor our animals.  Because of the large number of troops then in West\r\nTennessee and about Corinth, the indifferent railroad leading down\r\nfrom Columbus, Ky., was taxed to its utmost capacity to transport\r\nsupplies.  The quantity of grain received at Corinth from the north\r\nwas therefore limited, and before reaching the different outposts, by\r\npassing through intermediate depots of supply, it had dwindled to\r\ninsignificance.  I had hopes, however, that this condition of things\r\nmight be ameliorated before long by gathering a good supply of corn\r\nthat was ripening in the neighborhood, and would soon, I thought, be\r\nsufficiently hard to feed to my animals.  Not far from my\r\nheadquarters there was a particularly fine field, which, with this\r\nend in view, I had carefully protected through the milky stage, to\r\nthe evident disappointment of both Asboth's men and mine.  They bore\r\nthe prohibition well while it affected only themselves, but the trial\r\nwas too great when it came to denying their horses; and men whose\r\ndiscipline kept faith with my guards during the roasting-ear period\r\nnow fell from grace.  Their horses were growing thin, and few could\r\nwithstand the mute appeals of their suffering pets; so at night the\r\ncorn, because of individual foraging, kept stealthily and steadily\r\nvanishing, until the field was soon fringed with only earless stalks.\r\nThe disappearance was noticed, and the guard increased, but still the\r\nquantity of corn continued to grow less, the more honest troopers\r\nbemoaning the loss, and questioning the honor of those to whose\r\nsafekeeping it had been entrusted.  Finally, doubtless under the\r\napprehension that through their irregularities the corn would all\r\ndisappear and find its way to the horses in accordance with the\r\nstealthy enterprise of their owners, a general raid was made on the\r\nfield in broad daylight, and though the guard drove off the\r\nmarauders, I must admit that its efforts to keep them back were so\r\nunsuccessful that my hopes for an equal distribution of the crop were\r\nquickly blasted.  One look at the field told that it had been swept\r\nclean of its grain.  Of course a great row occurred as to who was to\r\nblame, and many arrests and trials took place, but there had been\r\nsuch an interchanging of cap numbers and other insignia that it was\r\nnext to impossible to identify the guilty, and so much crimination\r\nand acrimony grew out of the affair that it was deemed best to drop\r\nthe whole matter.\r\n\r\nOn August 27 about half of the command was absent reconnoitring, I\r\nhaving sent it south toward Tupelo, in the hope of obtaining some\r\ndefinite information regarding a movement to Holly Springs of the\r\nremainder of the Confederate army, under General Price, when about\r\nmid-day I was suddenly aroused by excited cries and sounds of firing,\r\nand I saw in a moment that the enemy was in my camp.  He had come in\r\non my right flank from the direction of the Hatchie River, pell-mell\r\nwith our picket-post stationed about three miles out on the Ripley\r\nroad.  The whole force of the enemy comprised about eight hundred,\r\nbut only his advance entered with my pickets, whom he had charged and\r\nbadly stampeded, without, on their part, the pretense of a fight in\r\nbehalf of those whom it was their duty to protect until proper\r\ndispositions for defense could be made.  The day was excessively hot,\r\none of those sultry debilitating days that had caused the suspending\r\nof all military exercises; and as most of the men were lounging or\r\nsleeping in their tents, we were literally caught napping.  The alarm\r\nspread instantly through the camp, and in a moment the command turned\r\nout for action, somewhat in deshabille it is true, but none the less\r\neffective, for every man had grabbed his rifle and cartridge-box at\r\nthe first alarm.  Aided by a few shots from Captain Henry Hescock's\r\nbattery, we soon drove the intruders from our camp in about the same\r\ndisorder in which they had broken in on us.  By this time Colonel\r\nHatch and Colonel Albert L. Lee had mounted two battalions each, and\r\nI moved them out at a lively pace in pursuit, followed by a section\r\nof the battery.  No halt was called till we came upon the enemy's\r\nmain body, under Colonel Faulkner, drawn up in line of battle near\r\nNewland's store.  Opening on him with the two pieces of artillery, I\r\nhurriedly formed line confronting him, and quickly and with but\r\nlittle resistance drove him in confusion from the field.  The sudden\r\nturning of the tables dismayed Faulkner's men, and panic seizing\r\nthem, they threw away every loose article of arms or clothing of\r\nwhich they could dismember themselves, and ran in the wildest\r\ndisorder in a mad effort to escape.  As the chase went on the panic\r\nincreased, the clouds of dust from the road causing an intermingling\r\nof friend and foe.  In a little while the affair grew most ludicrous,\r\nFaulkner's hatless and coatless men taking to the woods in such\r\ndispersed order and so demoralized that a good many prisoners were\r\nsecured, and those of the enemy who escaped were hunted until dark.\r\nWhen the recall was sounded, our men came in loaded down with plunder\r\nin the shape of hats, haversacks, blankets, pistols, and shotguns, in\r\na quantity which amply repaid for the surprise of the morning, but\r\ndid not excuse the delinquent commander of our picket-guard, who a\r\nfew days later was brought to a realizing sense of his duty by a\r\ncourt-martial.\r\n\r\nShortly after this affair Captain Archibald P. Campbell, of the\r\nSecond Michigan Cavalry, presented me with the black horse called\r\nRienzi, since made historical from having been ridden by me in many\r\nbattles, conspicuously in the ride from Winchester to Cedar Creek,\r\nwhich has been celebrated in the poem by T. Buchanan Read.  This\r\nhorse was of Morgan stock, and then about three years old.  He was\r\njet black, excepting three white feet, sixteen hands high, and\r\nstrongly built, with great powers of endurance.  He was so active\r\nthat he could cover with ease five miles an hour at his natural\r\nwalking gait.  The gelding had been ridden very seldom; in fact,\r\nCampbell had been unaccustomed to riding till the war broke out, and,\r\nI think, felt some disinclination to mount the fiery colt.  Campbell\r\nhad an affection for him, however, that never waned, and would often\r\ncome to my headquarters to see his favorite, the colt being cared for\r\nthere by the regimental farrier, an old man named John Ashley, who\r\nhad taken him in charge when leaving Michigan, and had been his groom\r\never since.  Seeing that I liked the horse--I had ridden him on\r\nseveral occasions--Campbell presented him to me on one of these\r\nvisits, and from that time till the close of the war I rode him\r\nalmost continuously, in every campaign and battle in which I took\r\npart, without once finding him overcome by fatigue, though on many\r\noccasions his strength was severely tested by long marches and short\r\nrations.  I never observed in him any vicious habit; a nervousness\r\nand restlessness and switch of the tail, when everything about him\r\nwas in repose, being the only indication that he might be\r\nuntrustworthy.  No one but a novice could be deceived by this,\r\nhowever, for the intelligence evinced in every feature, and his\r\nthoroughbred appearance, were so striking that any person accustomed\r\nto horses could not misunderstand such a noble animal.  But Campbell\r\nthought otherwise, at least when the horse was to a certain degree\r\nyet untrained, and could not be pursuaded to ride him; indeed, for\r\nmore than a year after he was given to me, Campbell still retained\r\nsuspicions of his viciousness, though, along with this mistrust, an\r\nundiminished affection.  Although he was several times wounded, this\r\nhorse escaped death in action; and living to a ripe old age, died in\r\n1878, attended to the last with all the care and surrounded with\r\nevery comfort due the faithful service he had rendered.\r\n\r\nIn moving from Corinth east toward Chattanooga, General Buell's army\r\nwas much delayed by the requirement that he should repair the Memphis\r\nand Charleston railroad as he progressed.  The work of repair obliged\r\nhim to march very slowly, and was of but little use when done, for\r\nguerrillas and other bands of Confederates destroyed the road again\r\nas soon as he had passed on.  But worst of all, the time thus\r\nconsumed gave General Bragg the opportunity to reorganize and\r\nincrease his army to such an extent that he was able to contest the\r\npossession of Middle Tennessee and Kentucky.  Consequently, the\r\nmovement of this army through Tennessee and Kentucky toward the Ohio\r\nRiver--its objective points being Louisville and Cincinnati--was now\r\nwell defined, and had already rendered abortive General Buell's\r\ndesigns on Chattanooga and East Tennessee.  Therefore extraordinary\r\nefforts on the part of the Government became necessary, and the\r\nconcentration of National troops at Louisville and Cincinnati to meet\r\nthe contingency of Bragg's reaching those points was an obvious\r\nrequirement.  These troops were drawn from all sections in the West\r\nwhere it was thought they could be spared, and among others I was\r\nordered to conduct thither--to Louisville or Cincinnati, as\r\nsubsequent developments might demand--my regiment, Hescock's battery,\r\nthe Second and Fifteenth Missouri, and the Thirty-sixth and\r\nForty-fourth Illinois regiments of infantry, known as the \"Pea Ridge\r\nBrigade.\" With this column I marched back to Corinth on the 6th of\r\nSeptember, 1862, for the purpose of getting railroad transportation\r\nto Columbus, Kentucky.\r\n\r\nAt Corinth I met General Grant, who by this time had been\r\nreestablished in favor and command somewhat, General Halleck having\r\ndeparted for Washington to assume command of the army as\r\nGeneral-in-Chief.  Before and during the activity which followed his\r\nreinstatement, General Grant had become familiar with my services\r\nthrough the transmission to Washington of information I had furnished\r\nconcerning the enemy's movements, and by reading reports of my fights\r\nand skirmishes in front, and he was loth to let me go.  Indeed, he\r\nexpressed surprise at seeing me in Corinth, and said he had not\r\nexpected me to go; he also plainly showed that he was much hurt at\r\nthe inconsiderate way in which his command was being depleted.  Since\r\nI was of the opinion that the chief field of usefulness and\r\nopportunity was opening up in Kentucky, I did not wish him to retain\r\nme, which he might have done, and I impressed him with my conviction,\r\nsomewhat emphatically, I fear.  Our conversation ended with my wish\r\ngratified.  I afterward learned that General Granger, whom General\r\nGrant did not fancy, had suggested that I should take to Cincinnati\r\nthe main portion of Granger's command--the Pea Ridge Brigade--as well\r\nas the Second Michigan Cavalry, of which I was still colonel.\r\nWe started that night, going by rail over the Mobile and Ohio road to\r\nColumbus, Ky., where we embarked on steamboats awaiting us.  These\r\nboats were five in number, and making one of them my flag-ship,\r\nexpecting that we might come upon certain batteries reported to be\r\nlocated upon the Kentucky shore of the Ohio, I directed the rest to\r\nfollow my lead.  Just before reaching Caseyville, the captain of a\r\ntin-clad gunboat that was patrolling the river brought me the\r\ninformation that the enemy was in strong force at Caseyville, and\r\nexpressed a fear that my fleet could not pass his batteries.\r\nAccepting the information as correct, I concluded to capture the\r\nplace before trying to pass up the river.  Pushing in to the bank as\r\nwe neared the town, I got the troops ashore and moved on Caseyville,\r\nin the expectation of a bloody fight, but was agreeably surprised\r\nupon reaching the outskirts of the village by an outpouring of its\r\ninhabitants--men, women, and children--carrying the Stars and\r\nStripes, and making the most loyal professions.  Similar\r\ndemonstrations of loyalty had been made to the panic-stricken captain\r\nof the gunboat when he passed down the river, but he did not stay to\r\nascertain their character, neither by landing nor by inquiry, for he\r\nassumed that on the Kentucky bank of the river there could be no\r\nloyalty.  The result mortified the captain intensely; and deeming his\r\nconvoy of little further use, he steamed toward Cairo in quest of\r\nother imaginary batteries, while I re-embarked at Caseyville, and\r\ncontinued up the Ohio undisturbed.  About three miles below\r\nCincinnati I received instructions to halt, and next day I was\r\nordered by Major-General H. G. Wright to take my troops back to\r\nLouisville, and there assume command of the Pea Ridge Brigade,\r\ncomposed of the Second and Fifteenth Missouri, Thirty-sixth and\r\nForty-fourth Illinois infantry, and of such other regiments as might\r\nbe sent me in advance of the arrival of General Buell's army.\r\nWhen I reached Louisville I reported to Major-General William Nelson,\r\nwho was sick, and who received me as he lay in bed.  He asked me why\r\nI did not wear the shoulder-straps of my rank.  I answered that I was\r\nthe colonel of the Second Michigan cavalry, and had on my appropriate\r\nshoulder-straps.  He replied that I was a brigadier-general for the\r\nBooneville fight, July 1, and that I should wear the shoulder-straps\r\nof that grade.  I returned to my command and put it in camp; and\r\nas I had no reluctance to wearing the shoulder-straps of a\r\nbrigadier-general, I was not long in procuring a pair, particularly\r\nas I was fortified next day by receiving from Washington official\r\ninformation of my appointment as a brigadier-general, to date from\r\nJuly 1, 1862, the day of the battle of Booneville.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nGOOD ADVICE FROM GENERAL NELSON--HIS TRAGIC DEATH--PUTTING LOUISVILLE\r\nIN A STATE OF DEFENSE--ASSIGNED TO THE COMMAND OF THE ELEVENTH\r\nDIVISION--CAPTURE OF CHAPLIN HEIGHTS--BATTLE OF PERRYVILLE--REPORTED\r\nAMONG THE KILLED--A THRILLING INCIDENT--GENERAL BUELL RELIEVED BY\r\nGENERAL ROSECRANS.\r\n\r\nI reported to Major-General Nelson at the Galt House in Louisville,\r\nSeptember 14, 1862, who greeted me in the bluff and hearty fashion of\r\na sailor--for he had been in the navy till the breaking out of the\r\nwar.  The new responsibilities that were now to fall upon me by\r\nvirtue of increased rank caused in my mind an uneasiness which, I\r\nthink, Nelson observed at the interview, and he allayed it by giving\r\nme much good advice, and most valuable information in regard to\r\naffairs in Kentucky, telling me also that he intended I should retain\r\nin my command the Pea Ridge Brigade and Hescock's battery.  This\r\nlatter assurance relieved me greatly, for I feared the loss of these\r\ntroops in the general redistribution which I knew must soon take\r\nplace; and being familiar with their valuable service in Missouri,\r\nand having brought them up from Mississippi, I hoped they would\r\ncontinue with me.  He directed me to take position just below the\r\ncity with the Pea Ridge Brigade, Hescock's battery, and the Second\r\nMichigan Cavalry, informing me, at the same time, that some of the\r\nnew regiments, then arriving under a recent call of the President for\r\nvolunteers, would also be assigned to my command.  Shortly after the\r\ninterview eight new regiments and an additional battery joined me,\r\nthus making good his promise of more troops.\r\n\r\nA few days later came Nelson's tragic end, shocking the whole\r\ncountry.  Those of us in camp outside of the city were startled on\r\nthe morning of September 29 by the news that General Jefferson C.\r\nDavis, of the Union Army, had shot General Nelson at the Galt House,\r\nand the wildest rumors in regard to the occurrence came thick and\r\nfast; one to the effect that Nelson was dead, another having it that\r\nhe was living and had killed Davis, and still others reflecting on\r\nthe loyalty of both, it being supposed by the general public at first\r\nthat the difficulty between the two men had grown out of some\r\npolitical rather than official or personal differences.  When the\r\nnews came, I rode into the city to the Galt House to learn the\r\nparticulars, reaching there about 10 o'clock in the forenoon.  Here I\r\nlearned that Nelson had been shot by Davis about two hours before, at\r\nthe foot of the main stairway leading from the corridor just beyond\r\nthe office to the second floor, and that Nelson was already dead.  It\r\nwas almost as difficult to get reliable particulars of the matter at\r\nthe hotel as it had been in my camp, but I gathered that the two men\r\nhad met first at an early hour near the counter of the hotel office,\r\nand that an altercation which had begun several days before in\r\nrelation to something official was renewed by Davis, who, attempting\r\nto speak to Nelson in regard to the subject-matter of their previous\r\ndispute, was met by an insulting refusal to listen.  It now appears\r\nthat when Nelson made this offensive remark, Davis threw a small\r\npaper ball that he was nervously rolling between his fingers into\r\nNelson's face, and that this insult was returned by Nelson slapping\r\nDavis (Killed by a Brother Soldier.--Gen. J. B. Fry.) in the face.\r\nBut at the time, exactly what had taken place just before the\r\nshooting was shrouded in mystery by a hundred conflicting stories,\r\nthe principal and most credited of which was that Davis had demanded\r\nfrom Nelson an apology for language used in the original altercation,\r\nand that Nelson's refusal was accompanied by a slap in the face, at\r\nthe same moment denouncing Davis as a coward.  However this may be,\r\nNelson, after slapping Davis, moved toward the corridor, from which a\r\nstairway led to the second floor, and just as he was about to ascend,\r\nDavis fired with a pistol that he had obtained from some one near by\r\nafter the blow had been struck.  The ball entered Nelson's breast\r\njust above the heart, but his great strength enabled him to ascend\r\nthe stairway notwithstanding the mortal character of the wound, and\r\nhe did not fall till he reached the corridor on the second floor.  He\r\ndied about half an hour later.  The tragedy cast a deep gloom over\r\nall who knew the men, for they both had many warm personal friends;\r\nand affairs at Louisville had hardly recovered as yet from the\r\nconfused and discouraging condition which preceded the arrival of\r\nGeneral Buell's army.  General Buell reported the killing of Nelson\r\nto the authorities at Washington, and recommended the trial of Davis\r\nby court-martial, but no proceedings were ever instituted against him\r\nin either a civil or military court, so to this day it has not been\r\ndetermined judicially who was the aggressor.  Some months later Davis\r\nwas assigned to the command of a division in Buell's army after that\r\nofficer had been relieved from its command.\r\n\r\nTwo Confederate armies, under General Kirby Smith and General Braxton\r\nBragg, had penetrated into Kentucky, the one under Smith by the way\r\nof Cumberland Gap, the other and main army under Bragg by way of the\r\nSequatche Valley, Glasgow, and Mumfordsville.  Glasgow was captured\r\nby the enemy on the 17th of September, and as the expectation was\r\nthat Buell would reach the place in time to save the town, its loss\r\ncreated considerable alarm in the North, for fears were now\r\nentertained that Bragg would strike Louisville and capture the city\r\nbefore Buell could arrive on the ground.  It became necessary\r\ntherefore to put Louisville in a state of defense, and after the\r\ncordon of principal works had been indicated, my troops threw up in\r\none night a heavy line of rifle-pits south of the city, from the\r\nBardstown pike to the river.  The apprehended attack by Bragg never\r\ncame, however, for in the race that was then going on between him and\r\nBuell on parallel roads, the Army of the Ohio outmarched the\r\nConfederates, its advance arriving at Louisville September 25.\r\n\r\nGeneral Buell immediately set about reorganizing the whole force, and\r\non September 29 issued an order designating the troops under my\r\ncommand as the Eleventh Division, Army of the Ohio, and assigning\r\nBrigadier-General J. T. Boyle to command the division, and me to\r\ncommand one of its brigades.  To this I could not object, of course,\r\nfor I was a brigadier-general of very recent date, and could hardly\r\nexpect more than a brigade.  I had learned, however, that at least\r\none officer to whom a high command had been given--a corps--had not\r\nyet been appointed a general officer by the President, and I\r\nconsidered it somewhat unfair that I should be relegated to a\r\nbrigade, while men who held no commissions at all were being made\r\nchiefs of corps and divisions; so I sought an interview with General\r\nBuell's chief-of-staff, Colonel Fry, and, while not questioning\r\nBuell's good intentions nor his pure motives, insisted that my rights\r\nin the matter should be recognized.  That same evening I was assigned\r\nto the command of the Eleventh Division, and began preparing it at\r\nonce for a forward movement, which I knew must soon take place in the\r\nresumption of offensive operations by the Army of the Ohio.\r\n\r\nDuring the interval from September 25 till October 1 there was among\r\nthe officers much criticism of General Buell's management of the\r\nrecent campaign, which had resulted in his retirement to Louisville;\r\nand he was particularly censured by many for not offering battle to\r\nGeneral Bragg while the two armies were marching parallel to each\r\nother, and so near that an engagement could have been brought on at\r\nany one of several points--notably so at Glasgow, Kentucky, if there\r\nhad been a desire to join issue.  It was asserted, and by many\r\nconceded, that General Buell had a sufficient force to risk a fight.\r\nHe was much blamed for the loss of Mumfordsville also.  The capture\r\nof this point, with its garrison, gave Bragg an advantage in the race\r\ntoward the Ohio River, which odds would most likely have ensured the\r\nfall of Louisville had they been used with the same energy and skill\r\nthat the Confederate commander displayed from Chattanooga to Glasgow;\r\nbut something always diverted General Bragg at the supreme moment,\r\nand he failed to utilize the chances falling to him at this time,\r\nfor, deflecting his march to the north toward Bardstown, he left open\r\nto Buell the direct road to Louisville by way of Elizabethtown.\r\n\r\nAt Bardstown Bragg's army was halted while he endeavored to establish\r\na Confederate government in Kentucky by arranging for the\r\ninstallation of a provisional governor at Lexington.  Bragg had been\r\nassured that the presence of a Confederate army in Kentucky would so\r\nencourage the secession element that the whole State could be forced\r\ninto the rebellion and his army thereby largely increased; but he had\r\nbeen considerably misled, for he now found that though much latent\r\nsympathy existed for his cause, yet as far as giving active aid was\r\nconcerned, the enthusiasm exhibited by the secessionists of Kentucky\r\nin the first year of the war was now replaced by apathy, or at best\r\nby lukewarmness.  So the time thus spent in political machinations\r\nwas wholly lost to Bragg; and so little reinforcement was added to\r\nhis army that it may be said that the recruits gained were not enough\r\nto supply the deficiencies resulting from the recent toilsome marches\r\nof the campaign.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Buell had arrived at Louisville, system had been\r\nsubstituted for the chaos which had previously obtained there, and\r\norders were issued for an advance upon the enemy with the purpose of\r\nattacking and the hope of destroying him within the limits of the\r\n\"blue grass\" region, and, failing in that, to drive him from\r\nKentucky.  The army moved October 1, 1862, and my division, now a\r\npart of the Third Corps, commanded by General C. C. Gilbert, marched\r\ndirectly on Bardstown, where it was thought the enemy would make a\r\nstand, but Bragg's troops retreated toward Perryville, only resisting\r\nsufficiently to enable the forces of General Kirby Smith to be drawn\r\nin closer--they having begun a concentration at Frankfort--so they\r\ncould be used in a combined attack on Louisville as soon as the\r\nConfederate commander's political projects were perfected.\r\n\r\nMuch time was consumed by Buell's army in its march on Perryville,\r\nbut we finally neared it on the evening of October 7.  During the\r\nday, Brigadier-General Robert B. Mitchell's division of Gilbert's\r\ncorps was in the advance on the Springfield pike, but as the enemy\r\ndeveloped that he was in strong force on the opposite side of a small\r\nstream called Doctor's Creek, a tributary of Chaplin River, my\r\ndivision was brought up and passed to the front.  It was very\r\ndifficult to obtain water in this section of Kentucky, as a drought\r\nhad prevailed for many weeks, and the troops were suffering so for\r\nwater that it became absolutely necessary that we should gain\r\npossession of Doctor's Creek in order to relieve their distress.\r\nConsequently General Gilbert, during the night, directed me to push\r\nbeyond Doctor's Creek early the next morning.  At daylight on the 8th\r\nI moved out Colonel Dan McCook's brigade and Barnett's battery for\r\nthe purpose, but after we had crossed the creek with some slight\r\nskirmishing, I found that we could not hold the ground unless we\r\ncarried and occupied a range of hills, called Chaplin Heights, in\r\nfront of Chaplin River.  As this would project my command in the\r\ndirection of Perryville considerably beyond the troops that were on\r\neither flank, I brought up Laiboldt's brigade and Hescock's battery\r\nto strengthen Colonel McCook.  Putting both brigades into line we\r\nquickly carried the Heights, much to the surprise of the enemy, I\r\nthink, for he did not hold on to the valuable ground as strongly as\r\nhe should have done.  This success not only ensured us a good supply\r\nof water, but also, later in the day, had an important bearing in the\r\nbattle of Perryville.  After taking the Heights, I brought up the\r\nrest of my division and intrenched, without much difficulty, by\r\nthrowing up a strong line of rifle-pits, although the enemy's\r\nsharpshooters annoyed us enough to make me order Laiboldt's brigade\r\nto drive them in on the main body.  This was successfully done in a\r\nfew minutes, but in pushing them back to Chaplin River, we discovered\r\nthe Confederates forming a line of battle on the opposite bank, with\r\nthe apparent purpose of an attack in force, so I withdrew the brigade\r\nto our intrenchments on the crest and there awaited the assault.\r\n\r\nWhile this skirmishing was going on, General Gilbert--the corps\r\ncommander--whose headquarters were located on a hill about a mile\r\ndistant to the rear, kept sending me messages by signal not to bring\r\non an engagement.  I replied to each message that I was not bringing\r\non an engagement, but that the enemy evidently intended to do so, and\r\nthat I believed I should shortly be attacked.  Soon after returning\r\nto the crest and getting snugly fixed in the rifle-pits, my attention\r\nwas called to our left, the high ground we occupied affording me in\r\nthat direction an unobstructed view.  I then saw General A. McD.\r\nMcCook's corps--the First-advancing toward Chaplin River by the\r\nMackville road, apparently unconscious that the Confederates were\r\npresent in force behind the stream.  I tried by the use of signal\r\nflags to get information of the situation to these troops, but my\r\nefforts failed, and the leading regiments seemed to approach the\r\nriver indifferently prepared to meet the sudden attack that speedily\r\nfollowed, delivered as it was from the chosen position of the enemy.\r\nThe fury of the Confederate assault soon halted this advance force,\r\nand in a short time threw it into confusion, pushed it back a\r\nconsiderable distance, and ultimately inflicted upon it such loss of\r\nmen and guns as to seriously cripple McCook's corps, and prevent for\r\nthe whole day further offensive movement on his part, though he\r\nstoutly resisted the enemy's assaults until 4 o'clock in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nSeeing McCook so fiercely attacked, in order to aid him I advanced\r\nHescock's battery, supported by six regiments, to a very good\r\nposition in front of a belt of timber on my extreme left, where an\r\nenfilading fire could be opened on that portion of the enemy\r\nattacking the right of the First Corps, and also on his batteries\r\nacross Chaplin River.  But at this juncture he placed two batteries\r\non my right and began to mass troops behind them, and General\r\nGilbert, fearing that my intrenched position on the heights might be\r\ncarried, directed me to withdraw Hescock and his supports and return\r\nthem to the pits.  My recall was opportune, for I had no sooner got\r\nback to my original line than the Confederates attacked me furiously,\r\nadvancing almost to my intrenchments, notwithstanding that a large\r\npart of the ground over which they had to move was swept by a heavy\r\nfire of canister from both my batteries.  Before they had quite\r\nreached us, however, our telling fire made them recoil, and as they\r\nfell back, I directed an advance of my whole division, bringing up my\r\nreserve regiments to occupy the crest of the hills; Colonel William\r\nP. Carlin's brigade of Mitchell's division meanwhile moving forward\r\non my right to cover that flank.  This advance pressed the enemy to\r\nPerryville, but he retired in such good order that we gained nothing\r\nbut some favorable ground that enabled me to establish my batteries\r\nin positions where they could again turn their attention to the\r\nConfederates in front of McCook, whose critical condition was shortly\r\nafter relieved, however, by a united pressure of Gilbert's corps\r\nagainst the flank of McCook's assailants, compelling them to retire\r\nbehind Chaplin River.\r\n\r\nThe battle virtually ended about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, though\r\nmore or less desultory firing continued until dark.  Considering the\r\nseverity of the engagement on McCook's front, and the reverses that\r\nhad befallen him, I question if, from that part of the line, much\r\ncould have been done toward retrieving the blunders of the day, but\r\nit did seem to me that, had the commander of the army been able to be\r\npresent on the field, he could have taken advantage of Bragg's final\r\nrepulse, and there would have remained in our hands more than the\r\nbarren field.  But no attempt was made to do anything more till next\r\nmorning, and then we secured little except the enemy's killed and\r\nmost severely wounded.\r\n\r\nThe operations of my division during the engagement pleased.  General\r\nGilbert very much, and he informed me that he would relax a rigidly\r\nenforced order which General Buell had issued some days before,\r\nsufficiently to permit my trains to come to the front and supply my\r\nalmost starving troops with rations.  The order in question was one\r\nof those issued, doubtless with a good intent, to secure generally\r\nthe safety of our trains, but General Gilbert was not elastic, and on\r\nthe march he had construed the order so illiberally that it was next\r\nto impossible to supply the men with food, and they were particularly\r\nshort in this respect on the eve of the battle.  I had then\r\nendeavored to persuade him to modify his iron-clad interpretation of\r\nthe order, but without effect, and the only wagons we could bring up\r\nfrom the general parks in rear were ambulances and those containing\r\nammunition.  So to gain access to our trains was a great boon, and at\r\nthat moment a more welcome result than would have been a complete\r\nvictory minus this concession.\r\n\r\nWhen the battle ceased General Gilbert asked me to join him at\r\nBuell's headquarters, which were a considerable distance to the rear,\r\nso after making some dispositions for the evening I proceeded there\r\nas requested.  I arrived just as Buell was about to sit down to his\r\nsupper, and noticing that he was lame, then learned that he had been\r\nseverely injured by a recent fall from his horse.  He kindly invited\r\nme to join him at the table, an invitation which I accepted with\r\nalacrity, enjoying the meal with a relish known only to a very-hungry\r\nman, for I had eaten nothing since morning.  Of course the events of\r\nthe day were the chief topic of discussion--as they were during my\r\nstay at headquarters--but the conversation indicated that what had\r\noccurred was not fully realized, and I returned to my troops\r\nimpressed with the belief that General Buell and his staff-officers\r\nwere unconscious of the magnitude of the battle that had just been\r\nfought.\r\n\r\nIt had been expected by Buell that he would fight the enemy on the\r\n9th of October, but the Confederates disposed of that proposition by\r\nattacking us on the 8th, thus disarranging a tactical conception\r\nwhich, with our superior numbers, would doubtless have proved\r\nsuccessful had it not been anticipated by an enterprising foe.\r\nDuring the battle on the 8th the Second Corps, under General Thomas\r\nL. Crittenden, accompanied by General George H. Thomas, lay idle the\r\nwhole day for want of orders, although it was near enough to the\r\nfield to take an active part in the fight; and, moreover, a large\r\npart of Gilbert's corps was unengaged during the pressure on McCook.\r\nHad these troops been put in on the enemy's left at any time after he\r\nassaulted McCook, success would have been beyond question; but there\r\nwas no one on the ground authorized to take advantage of the\r\nsituation, and the battle of Perryville remains in history an example\r\nof lost opportunities.  This was due in some measure probably to\r\nGeneral Buell's accident, but is mainly attributable to the fact that\r\nhe did not clearly apprehend Bragg's aim, which was to gain time to\r\nwithdraw behind Dick's River all the troops he had in Kentucky, for\r\nthe Confederate general had no idea of risking the fate of his army\r\non one general battle at a place or on a day to be chosen by the\r\nUnion commander.\r\n\r\nConsidering the number of troops actually engaged, the losses to\r\nBuell were severe, amounting to something over five thousand in\r\nkilled, wounded, and missing.  Among the killed were two brigade\r\ncommanders of much promise--General James S. Jackson and General\r\nWilliam R. Terrill.  McCook's corps lost twelve guns, some of which\r\nwere recovered next day.  The enemy's loss in killed and wounded we\r\nnever learned, but it must have equalled ours; and about four\r\nthousand prisoners, consisting principally of sick and wounded, fell\r\ninto our hands.  In the first report of the battle sent North to the\r\nnewspapers I was reported among the killed; but I was pleased to\r\nnotice, when the papers reached us a few days later, that the error\r\nhad been corrected before my obituary could be written.\r\n\r\nThe enemy retired from our front the night of the 8th, falling back\r\non Harrodsburg to form a junction with Kirby Smith, and by taking\r\nthis line of retreat opened to us the road to Danville and the chance\r\nfor a direct march against his depot of supplies at Bryantsville.  We\r\ndid not take advantage of this opening, however, and late in the day\r\n--on the 9th--my division marched in pursuit, in the direction of\r\nHarrodsburg, which was the apex of a triangle having for its base a\r\nline from Perryville to Danville.  The pursuit was slow, very slow,\r\nconsuming the evening of the 9th and all of the 10th and 11th.  By\r\ncutting across the triangle spoken of above, just south of the apex,\r\nI struck the Harrodsburg-Danville road, near Cave Springs, joining\r\nthere Gilbert's left division, which had preceded me and marched\r\nthrough Harrodsburg.  Here we again rested until the intention of the\r\nenemy could be divined, and we could learn on which side of Dick's\r\nRiver he would give us battle.  A reconnoissance sent toward the\r\nDickville crossing developed to a certainty that we should not have\r\nanother engagement, however; for it disclosed the fact that Bragg's\r\narmy had disappeared toward Camp Dick Robinson, leaving only a small\r\nrear-guard at Danville, which in turn quickly fled in the direction\r\nof Lancaster, after exchanging a few shots with Hescock's battery.\r\n\r\nWhile this parting salute of deadly projectiles was going on, a\r\nlittle, daughter of Colonel William J. Landram, whose home was in\r\nDanville, came running out from his house and planted a small\r\nnational flag on one of Hescock's guns.  The patriotic act was so\r\nbrave and touching that it thrilled all who witnessed the scene; and\r\nuntil the close of the war, when peace separated the surviving\r\nofficers and men of the battery, that little flag was protected and\r\ncherished as a memento of the Perryville campaign.\r\n\r\nPursuit of the enemy was not continued in force beyond Crab Orchard,\r\nbut some portions of the army kept at Bragg's heels until he crossed\r\nthe Cumberland River, a part of his troops retiring to Tennessee by\r\nway of Cumberland Gap, but the major portion through Somerset.  As\r\nthe retreat of Bragg transferred the theatre of operations back to\r\nTennessee, orders were now issued for a concentration of Buell's army\r\nat Bowling Green, with a view to marching it to Nashville, and my\r\ndivision moved to that point without noteworthy incident.  I reached\r\nBowling Green with a force much reduced by the losses sustained in\r\nthe battle of Perryville and by sickness.  I had started from\r\nLouisville on October 1 with twelve regiments of infantry--four old\r\nand eight new ones--and two batteries, but many poor fellows,\r\novercome by fatigue, and diseases induced by the heat, dust, and\r\ndrought of the season, had to be left at roadside hospitals.  This\r\nwas particularly the case with the new regiments, the men of which,\r\nmuch depressed by homesickness, and not yet inured to campaigning,\r\nfell easy victims to the hardships of war.\r\n\r\nAt Bowling Green General Buell was relieved, General W. S. Rosecrans\r\nsucceeding him.  The army as a whole did not manifest much regret at\r\nthe change of commanders, for the campaign from Louisville on was\r\nlooked upon generally as a lamentable failure, yet there were many\r\nwho still had the utmost confidence in General Buell, and they\r\nrepelled with some asperity the reflections cast upon him by his\r\ncritics.  These admirers held him blameless throughout for the\r\nblunders of the campaign, but the greater number laid every error at\r\nhis door, and even went to the absurdity of challenging his loyalty\r\nin a mild way, but they particularly charged incompetency at\r\nPerryville, where McCook's corps was so badly crippled while nearly\r\n30,000 Union troops were idle on the field, or within striking\r\ndistance.  With these it was no use to argue that Buell's accident\r\nstood in the way of his activity, nor that he did not know that the\r\naction had assumed the proportions of a battle.  The physical\r\ndisability was denied or contested, but even granting this, his\r\ndetractors claimed that it did not excuse his ignorance of the true\r\ncondition of the fight, and finally worsted his champions by pointing\r\nout that Bragg's retreat by way of Harrodsburg beyond Dick's River so\r\njeopardized the Confederate army, that had a skillful and energetic\r\nadvance of the Union troops been made, instead of wasting precious\r\ntime in slow and unnecessary tactical manoeuvres, the enemy could\r\nhave been destroyed before he could quit the State of Kentucky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nMOVING TO BOWLING GREEN--JAMES CARD, THE SCOUT AND GUIDE--GENERAL\r\nSILL--COLONEL SCHAEFER--COLONEL G. W. ROBERTS--MOVEMENT ON\r\nMURFREESBORO'--OPENING OF THE BATTLE OF STONE RIVER.\r\n\r\nMy division had moved from Crab Orchard to Bowling Green by easy\r\nmarches, reaching this place November 1. General Rosecrans assumed\r\ncommand of the department October 30, at Louisville, and joined the\r\narmy November 2.  There had been much pressure brought to bear on\r\nGeneral Buell to induce him to take measures looking to the occupancy\r\nof East Tennessee, and the clamor to this end from Washington still\r\ncontinued; but now that Bragg was south of the Cumberland River, in a\r\nposition threatening Nashville, which was garrisoned by but a small\r\nforce, it was apparent to every one at all conversant with the\r\nsituation that a battle would have to be fought somewhere in Middle\r\nTennessee.  So, notwithstanding the pressure from Washington, the\r\narmy was soon put in motion for Nashville, and when we arrived there\r\nmy division went into camp north of the river, on a plateau just\r\noutside the little town of Edgefield, until the movements of the\r\nenemy should be further developed.\r\n\r\nWhile in this camp, on the plantation of Mr. Hobson, there came to my\r\nheadquarters one morning an East Tennessean named James Card, who\r\noffered to the Union cause his services in any capacity in which they\r\nmight be made useful.  This offer, and the relation of his personal\r\nhistory, were given with such sincerity of speech and manner that in\r\na short time I became convinced of his honesty of purpose.  He was a\r\nsmall, active, busy man, with a determined way about him, and his\r\ncountenance indicated great intelligence.  He gave minute information\r\nthat was of inestimable value to me regarding East and Middle\r\nTennessee and northern Georgia, for, with a view to the army's future\r\nmovements, I was then making a study of the topography of this\r\nregion, and posting myself as to Middle Tennessee, for all knew this\r\nwould be the scene of active operations whenever the campaign was\r\nresumed.  This man, like most of the East Tennesseans whom I had met,\r\nwas intensely loyal and patriotic, and the interview led in a few\r\ndays to his employment as a scout and guide, and subsequently to the\r\nengaging in the same capacity of two of his brothers, who were good\r\nmen; but not quite as active nor so intelligent as he was.  Card had\r\nbeen a colporter, having pedled books, especially religious tracts,\r\nover all Middle and East Tennessee and Georgia, assisted by his\r\nbrothers at times, and was therefore thoroughly familiar with these\r\nregions, their roads and inhabitants.  He also preached to country\r\ncongregations occasionally, when ministers were scarce, and I have no\r\ndoubt often performed the functions of family physician in the\r\nmountain district.  Thus his opportunities were great; and the loyal\r\npeople in every section of the country being well known to him and\r\nhis brothers, the three began, at this time, a system of scouting and\r\ninvestigation which bore its first-fruits in specifically locating\r\nthe different divisions of Bragg's army, with statements of their\r\nstrength and condition, and all with so much accuracy that I\r\nthereafter felt reasonably sure that I could at all times procure\r\nsuch knowledge of the enemy's operations as would well equip me for\r\nany contingency that might arise.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of November the enemy, having assembled his forces in\r\nMiddle Tennessee, showed considerable boldness, and it became\r\nnecessary to rearrange the Union lines; so my troops were moved to\r\nthe south side of the river, out on the Murfreesboro' pike, to Mill\r\nCreek, distant from Nashville about seven miles.  While we were in\r\ncamp on Mill Creek the army was reorganized, and General Joshua W.\r\nSill, at his own request, was assigned to my division, and took\r\ncommand of Colonel Nicholas Greusel's brigade.  My division became at\r\nthe same time the Third Division, Right Wing, Fourteenth Army Corps,\r\nits three brigades of four regiments each being respectively\r\ncommanded by General Sill, Colonel Frederick Schaefer and Colonel Dan\r\nMcCook; but a few days later Colonel George W. Roberts's brigade,\r\nfrom the garrison at Nashville, was substituted for McCook's.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sill was a classmate of mine at the Military Academy, having\r\ngraduated in 1853.  On graduating he was appointed to the Ordnance\r\nCorps, and served in that department at various arsenals and ordnance\r\ndepots throughout the country till early in 1861, when he resigned to\r\naccept a professorship of mathematics and civil engineering at the\r\nBrooklyn Collegiate and Polytechnic Institute.  At the breaking out\r\nof the war he immediately tendered his services to the Government,\r\nand soon rose to the colonelcy of the Thirty-Third Ohio Volunteers,\r\nand afterward to the rank of brigadier-general.  I knew him well, and\r\nwas glad that he came to my division, though I was very loth to\r\nrelieve Colonel Greusel, of the Thirty-Sixth Illinois, who had\r\nalready indicated much military skill and bravery, and at the battle\r\nof Perryville had handled his men with the experience of a veteran.\r\nSill's modesty and courage were exceeded only by a capacity that had\r\nalready been demonstrated in many practical ways, and his untimely\r\ndeath, almost within a month of his joining me, abruptly closed a\r\ncareer which, had it been prolonged a little more, not only would\r\nhave shed additional lustre on his name, but would have been of\r\nmarked benefit to his country.\r\n\r\nColonel Schaefer, of the Second Missouri Infantry, had been absent on\r\nsick-leave during the Kentucky campaign, but about this date he\r\nreturned to duty, and by seniority fell in command of the second\r\nbrigade.  He was of German birth, having come from Baden, where,\r\nprior to 1848, he had been a non-commissioned officer in the service\r\nof his State.  He took part as an insurgent in the so-called\r\nrevolution which occurred at Baden in that year, and, compelled to\r\nemigrate on the suppression of the insurrection, made his way to this\r\ncountry and settled in St. Louis.  Here the breaking out of the war\r\nfound him, and through the personal interest which General Sigel took\r\nin him he was commissioned a colonel of volunteers.  He had had a\r\npretty fair education, a taste for the military profession, and was\r\nof tall and slender build, all of which gave him a student-like\r\nappearance.  He was extremely excitable and nervous when anticipating\r\na crisis, but always calmed down to cool deliberation when the\r\ncritical moment came.  With such a man I could not be less than well\r\nsatisfied, although the officer whom he replaced--Colonel Laiboldt\r\n--had performed efficient service and shown much capacity in the\r\nrecent campaign.\r\n\r\nColonel G. W. Roberts, of the Forty-Second Illinois Infantry, also\r\ncame to me in the reorganization.  He was an ideal soldier both in\r\nmind and body.  He was young, tall, handsome, brave, and dashing, and\r\npossessed a balance-wheel of such good judgment that in his sphere of\r\naction no occasion could arise from which he would not reap the best\r\nresults.  But he too was destined to lay, down his life within a few\r\ndays, and on the same fatal field.  His brigade had been performing\r\ngarrison duty in Nashville during the siege of that city while\r\nBuell's army was in Kentucky, but disliking the prospect of\r\ninactivity pending the operations opening before us, Roberts had\r\nrequested and obtained a transfer to the army in the field.  His\r\nbrigade relieved Colonel Dan McCook's, the latter reluctantly joining\r\nthe garrison at Nashville, every one in it disappointed and disgusted\r\nthat the circumstances existing at this time should necessitate their\r\nrelegation to the harassing and tantalizing duty of protecting our\r\ndepots and line of supply.\r\n\r\nI was fortunate in having such brigade commanders, and no less\r\nfavored in the regimental and battery commanders.  They all were not\r\nonly patriots, but soldiers, and knowing that discipline must be one\r\nof the most potent factors in bringing to a successful termination,\r\nthe mighty contest in which our nation was struggling for existence,\r\nthey studied and practiced its methods ceaselessly, inspiring with\r\nthe same spirit that pervaded themselves the loyal hearts of their\r\nsubordinate officers and men.  All worked unremittingly in the camp\r\nat Mill Creek in preparing for the storm, which now plainly indicated\r\nits speedy coming.  Drills, parades, scouts, foraging expeditions,\r\npicket and guard duty, made up the course in this school of\r\ninstruction, supplemented by frequent changes in the locations of the\r\ndifferent brigades, so that the division could have opportunity to\r\nlearn to break camp quickly and to move out promptly on the march.\r\nForaging expeditions were particularly beneficial in this respect,\r\nand when sent out, though absent sometimes for days, the men went\r\nwithout tents or knapsacks, equipped with only one blanket and their\r\narms, ammunition, and rations, to teach them to shift for themselves\r\nwith slender means in the event of necessity.  The number of\r\nregimental and headquarters wagons was cut down to the lowest\r\npossible figure, and everything made compact by turning into the\r\nsupply and ammunition trains of the division all surplus\r\ntransportation, and restricting the personal baggage of officers to\r\nthe fewest effects possible.\r\n\r\nMy own staff also was somewhat reorganized and increased at Mill\r\nCreek, and though it had been perfectly satisfactory before, yet, on\r\naccount of the changes of troops that had occurred in the command, I\r\nfound it necessary to replace valuable officers in some instances,\r\nand secure additional ones in others.  The gathering of information\r\nabout the enemy was also industriously pursued, and Card and his\r\nbrothers were used constantly on expeditions within the Confederate\r\nlines, frequently visiting Murfreesboro', Sparta, Tullahoma,\r\nShelbyville, and other points.  What they learned was reported to\r\narmy headquarters, often orally through me or personally communicated\r\nby Card himself, but much was forwarded in official letters,\r\nbeginning with November 24, when I transmitted accurate information\r\nof the concentration of Bragg's main force at Tullahoma.  Indeed,\r\nCard kept me so well posted as to every movement of the enemy, not\r\nonly with reference to the troops in my immediate front, but also\r\nthroughout his whole army, that General Rosecrans placed the most\r\nunreserved reliance on all his statements, and many times used them\r\nto check and correct the reports brought in by his own scouts.\r\n\r\nSlight skirmishes took place frequently during this period, and now\r\nand then heavy demonstrations were made in the neighborhood of\r\nNolensville by reconnoitring parties from both armies, but none of\r\nthese ever grew into a battle.  These affairs sprung from the desire\r\nof each side to feel his antagonist, and had little result beyond\r\nemphasizing the fact that behind each line of pickets lay a massed\r\nand powerful army busily preparing for the inevitable conflict and\r\neager for its opening.  So it wore on till the evening of December\r\n25, 1862; then came the order to move forward.\r\n\r\nGeneral Rosecrans, in the reorganization of the army, had assigned\r\nMajor-General A. McD. McCook to command the right wing, Major-General\r\nGeorge H. Thomas the centre, and Major-General T. L. Crittenden the\r\nleft wing.  McCook's wing was made up of three divisions,\r\ncommanded in order of rank by Brigadier-General Jeff. C. Davis;\r\nBrigadier-General R. W. Johnson, and Brigadier-General P. H. Sheridan.\r\nAlthough the corps nomenclature established by General Buell was\r\ndropped, the grand divisions into which he had organized the army at\r\nLouisville were maintained, and, in fact, the conditions established\r\nthen remained practically unaltered, with the exception of the\r\ninterchange of some brigades, the transfer of a few general officers\r\nfrom one wing or division to another, and the substitution of General\r\nThomas for Gilbert as a corps commander.  The army was thus compact\r\nand cohesive, undisturbed by discord and unembarrassed by jealousies\r\nof any moment; and it may be said that under a commander who, we\r\nbelieved, had the energy and skill necessary to direct us to success,\r\na national confidence in our invincibility made us all keen for a\r\ntest of strength with the Confederates.  We had not long to wait.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of December 26, 1862, in a heavy rain, the army\r\nmarched, the movement being directed on Murfreesboro', where the\r\nenemy had made some preparation to go into winter-quarters, and to\r\nhold which town it was hoped he would accept battle.  General Thomas\r\nmoved by the Franklin and Wilson pikes, General Crittenden by the\r\nMurfreesboro' pike, through Lavergne, and General McCook by the\r\nNolensville pike--Davis's division in advance.  As McCook's command\r\nneared Nolensville, I received a message from Davis informing me that\r\nthe Confederates were in considerable force, posted on a range of\r\nhills in his front, and requesting me to support him in an attack he\r\nwas about to make.  When the head of my column arrived at Nolensville\r\nI began massing my troops on the right of the road, and by the time\r\nthis formation was nearly completed Davis advanced, but not meeting\r\nwith sufficient resistance to demand active assistance from me, he\r\nwith his own command carried the hills, capturing one piece of\r\nartillery.  This position of the Confederates was a strong one,\r\ndefending Knob's Gap, through which the Nolensville and Triune pike\r\npassed.  On the 27th Johnson's division, followed by mine, advanced\r\nto Triune, and engaged in a severe skirmish near that place, but my\r\ntroops were not called into action, the stand made by the enemy being\r\nonly for the purpose of gaining time to draw in his outlying troops,\r\nwhich done, he retired toward Murfreesboro'.  I remained inactive at\r\nTriune during the 28th, but early on the 29th moved out by the Bole\r\nJack road to the support of, Davis in his advance to Stewart's Creek,\r\nand encamped at Wilkinson's crossroads, from which point to\r\nMurfreesboro', distant about six miles, there was a good turnpike.\r\nThe enemy had sullenly resisted the progress of Crittenden and McCook\r\nthroughout the preceding three days, and as it was thought probable\r\nthat he might offer battle at Stewart's Creek, Thomas, in pursuance\r\nof his original instructions looking to just such a contingency, had\r\nnow fallen into the centre by way of the Nolensville crossroads.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 30th I had the advance of McCook's corps on the\r\nWilkinson pike, Roberts's brigade leading.  At first only slight\r\nskirmishing took place, but when we came within about three miles of\r\nMurfreesboro' the resistance of the enemy's pickets grew serious, and\r\na little further on so strong that I had to put in two regiments to\r\npush them back.  I succeeded in driving them about half a mile, when\r\nI was directed by McCook to form line of battle and place my\r\nartillery in position so that I could act in concert with Davis's\r\ndivision, which he wished to post on my right in the general line he\r\ndesired to take up.  In obedience to these directions I deployed on\r\nthe right of, and oblique to the Wilkinson pike, with a front of four\r\nregiments, a second line of four regiments within short supporting\r\ndistance, and a reserve of one brigade in column of regiments to the\r\nrear of my centre.  All this time the enemy kept up a heavy artillery\r\nand musketry fire on my skirmishers, he occupying, with his\r\nsharpshooters, beyond some open fields, a heavy belt of timber to my\r\nfront and right, where it was intended the left of Davis should\r\nfinally rest.  To gain this point Davis was ordered to swing his\r\ndivision into it in conjunction with a wheeling movement of my right\r\nbrigade, until our continuous line should face nearly due east.  This\r\nwould give us possession of the timber referred to, and not only rid\r\nus of the annoying fire from the skirmishers screened by it, but also\r\nplace us close in to what was now developing as Bragg's line of\r\nbattle.  The movement was begun about half-past 2, and was\r\nsuccessfully executed, after a stubborn resistance.  In this\r\npreliminary affair the enemy had put in one battery of artillery,\r\nwhich was silenced in a little while, however, by Bush's and\r\nHescock's guns.  By sundown I had taken up my prescribed position,\r\nfacing almost east, my left (Roberts's brigade) resting on the\r\nWilkinson pike, the right (Sill's brigade) in the timber we had just\r\ngained, and the reserve brigade (Schaefer's) to the rear of my\r\ncentre, on some rising ground in the edge of a strip of woods behind\r\nHoughtaling's and Hescock's batteries.  Davis's division was placed\r\nin position on my right, his troops thrown somewhat to the rear, so\r\nthat his line formed nearly a right angle with mine, while Johnson's\r\ndivision formed in a very exposed position on the right of Davis,\r\nprolonging the general line just across the Franklin pike.\r\n\r\nThe centre, under Thomas, had already formed to my left, the right of\r\nNegley's division joining my left in a cedar thicket near the\r\nWilkinson pike, while Crittenden's corps was posted on the left of\r\nThomas, his left resting on Stone River, at a point about two miles\r\nand a half from Murfreesboro'.\r\n\r\nThe precision that had characterized every manoeuvre of the past\r\nthree days, and the exactness with which each corps and division fell\r\ninto its allotted place on the evening of the 30th, indicated that at\r\nthe outset of the campaign a well-digested plan of operations had\r\nbeen prepared for us; and although the scheme of the expected battle\r\nwas not known to subordinates of my grade, yet all the movements up\r\nto this time had been so successfully and accurately made as to give\r\nmuch promise for the morrow, and when night fell there was general\r\nanticipation of the best results to the Union army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nASSAULT ON OUR RIGHT FLANK--OCCUPYING A NEW POSITION--THE ENEMY\r\nCHECKED--TERRIBLE LOSS OF OFFICERS--AMMUNITION GIVES OUT\r\n--RECONSTRUCTING THE LINE--COLLECTING THE WOUNDED AND BURYING\r\nTHE DEAD--DEALING WITH COWARDS--RESULTS OF THE VICTORY.\r\n\r\nThe enemy under Bragg lay between us and stone River in order of\r\nbattle, his general line conforming to the course of that stream. In\r\nmy immediate front he appeared to be established in strong force in a\r\ndense cedar wood, just beyond an open valley, which varied from two\r\nhundred to four hundred yards in width, the cedars extending the\r\nentire length of the valley.  From the events of the day and evening\r\nof the 3oth, it was apparent that the two armies were in close\r\nproximity, and orders received during the night revealed the fact\r\nthat Rosecrans intended to attack by throwing his left on the enemy's\r\nright, with the expectation of driving it in toward Murfreesboro', so\r\nthat the right of Crittenden's corps could attack Bragg's centre in\r\nreverse, while Thomas supported Crittenden by a simultaneous front\r\nassault; and from the movements of the enemy at daylight next\r\nmorning, it was plainly indicated that Bragg had planned to swing his\r\nleft on our right by an exactly similar manoeuvre, get possession of\r\nthe railroad and the Nashville pike, and if possible cut us off from\r\nour base at Nashville.  The conceptions in the minds of the two\r\ngenerals were almost identical; but Bragg took the initiative,\r\nbeginning his movement about an hour earlier than the time set by\r\nRosecrans, which gained him an immense advantage in execution in the\r\nearlier stages of the action.\r\n\r\nDuring the evening, feeling keenly all the solicitude which\r\nattends one in anticipation of a battle, I examined my position with\r\ngreat care, inspecting its whole length several times to remedy any\r\ndefects that might exist, and to let the men see that I was alive to\r\ntheir interests and advantages.  After dark, I went back to the rear\r\nof my reserve brigade, and establishing my headquarters behind the\r\ntrunk of a large fallen tree, which would shelter me somewhat from\r\nthe cold December wind, lay down beside a small camp-fire to get some\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nAt 2 o'clock on the morning of the 31st General Sill came back to me\r\nto report that on his front a continuous movement of infantry and\r\nartillery had been going on all night within the Confederate lines,\r\nand that he was convinced that Bragg was massing on our right with\r\nthe purpose of making an attack from that direction early in the\r\nmorning.  After discussing for a few minutes the probabilities of\r\nsuch a course on the part of the enemy, I thought McCook should be\r\nmade acquainted with what was going on, so Sill and I went back to\r\nsee him at his headquarters, not far from the Griscom House, where we\r\nfound him sleeping on some straw in the angle of a worm-fence.  I\r\nwaked him up and communicated the intelligence, and our consequent\r\nimpressions.  He talked the matter over with us for some little time,\r\nbut in view of the offensive-defensive part he was to play in the\r\ncoming battle, did not seem to think that there was a necessity for\r\nany further dispositions than had already been taken.  He said that\r\nhe thought Johnson's division would be able to take care of the\r\nright, and seemed confident that the early assault which was to be\r\nmade from Rosecrans's left would anticipate and check the designs\r\nwhich we presaged.  We two then returned to my little camp-fire\r\nbehind the log, and as we continued talking of what might be expected\r\nfrom the indications on the right, and Sill becoming more anxious, I\r\ndirected two regiments from the reserve to report to him, that they\r\nmight be placed within very short supporting distance of his line.\r\nHe then rejoined his brigade, better satisfied, but still adhering to\r\nthe belief he had expressed when first making his report.\r\n\r\nLong before dawn my division breakfasted, and was assembled under\r\narms, the infantry in line, the cannoneers at their pieces, but while\r\nwe were thus preparing, all the recent signs of activity in the\r\nenemy's camp were hushed, a death-like stillness prevailing in the\r\ncedars to our front.  Shortly after daylight General Hardee opened\r\nthe engagement, just as Sill had predicted, by a fierce attack on\r\nJohnson's division, the extreme right of the Union line.  Immediate\r\nsuccess attending this assault, Hardee extended the attack gradually\r\nalong in front of Davis, hip movement taking the form of a wheel to\r\nthe right, the pivot being nearly opposite the left of my division.\r\nJohnson's division soon gave way, and two of Davis's brigades were\r\nforced to fall back with it, though stubbornly resisting the\r\ndetermined and sweeping onset.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the enemy had also attacked me, advancing across an\r\nold cotton-field in Sill's front in heavy masses, which were\r\nfuriously opened upon by Bush's battery from Sill's line, and by\r\nHescock's and Houghtaling's batteries, which had an oblique fire on\r\nthe field from a commanding position in rear of my centre.  The\r\neffect of this fire on the advancing column was terrible, but it\r\ncontinued on till it reached the edge of the timber where Sill's\r\nright lay, when my infantry opened at a range of not over fifty\r\nyards.  For a short time the Confederates withstood the fire, but\r\nthen wavered, broke, and fell back toward their original line.  As\r\nthey retired, Sill's brigade followed in a spirited charge, driving\r\nthem back across the open ground and behind their intrenchments.  In\r\nthis charge the gallant Sill was killed; a rifle ball passing through\r\nhis upper lip and penetrating the brain.  Although this was a heavy\r\nloss, yet the enemy's discomfiture was such as to give us an hour's\r\ntime, and as Colonel Greusel, Thirty-sixth Illinois, succeeded to\r\nSill's command, I directed him, as he took charge, to recall the\r\nbrigade to its original position, for the turning-column on my\r\nextreme right was now assuming the most menacing attitude, and it was\r\nurgently necessary to prepare for it.\r\n\r\nWhen that portion of the enemy driven back by Sill recovered from its\r\nrepulse it again advanced to the attack, this time directing its\r\nefforts chiefly upon my extreme right, and the front of Woodruff's\r\nbrigade of Davis's division, which brigade still held on in its first\r\nposition.  In front of my centre the Confederates were again driven\r\nback, but as the assault on Woodruff was in conjunction with an\r\nadvance of the column that had forced Johnson to retire, Woodruff was\r\ncompelled unfortunately to give way, and two regiments on the right\r\nof my line went with him, till they rallied on the two reserve\r\nregiments which, in anticipation of the enemy's initiatory attack I\r\nhad sent to Sill's rear before daylight.\r\n\r\nBoth Johnson's and Davis's divisions were now practically gone from\r\nour line, having retired with a loss of all formation, and they were\r\nbeing closely pursued by the enemy, whose columns were following the\r\narc of a circle that would ultimately carry him in on my rear.  In\r\nconsequence of the fact that this state of things would soon subject\r\nme to a fire in reverse, I hastily withdrew Sill's brigade and the\r\nreserve regiments supporting it, and ordered Roberts's brigade, which\r\nat the close of the enemy's second repulse had changed front toward\r\nthe south and formed in column of regiments, to cover the withdrawal\r\nby a charge on the Confederates as they came into the timber where my\r\nright had originally rested.  Roberts made the charge at the proper\r\ntime, and was successful in checking the enemy's advance, thus giving\r\nus a breathing-spell, during which I was able to take up a new\r\nposition with Schaefer's and Sill's brigades on the commanding ground\r\nto the rear, where Hescock's and Houghtaling's batteries had been\r\nposted all the morning.\r\n\r\nThe general course of this new position was at right angles with my\r\noriginal line, and it took the shape of an obtuse angle, with my\r\nthree batteries at the apex.  Davis, and Carlin of his division,\r\nendeavored to rally their men here on my right, but their efforts\r\nwere practically unavailing,--though the calm and cool appearance of\r\nCarlin, who at the time was smoking a stumpy pipe, had some effect,\r\nand was in strong contrast to the excited manner of Davis, who seemed\r\noverpowered by the disaster that had befallen his command.  But few\r\ncould be rallied, however, as the men were badly demoralized, and\r\nmost of them fell back beyond the Wilkinson pike, where they\r\nreorganized behind the troops of General Thomas.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the enemy's turning-column began advancing again in\r\nconcert with Cheatham's division, and as the extreme left of the\r\nConfederates was directed on Griscom's house, and their right on the\r\nBlanton house, my new position was in danger of envelopment.  No hope\r\nof stemming the tide at this point seemed probable, but to gain time\r\nI retained my ground as long as possible, and until, under directions\r\nfrom General McCook, I moved to the front from my left flank and\r\nattached myself to the right of Negley's division, which up to this\r\nhour had been left almost undisturbed by the enemy in the line it had\r\ntaken up the night before.  Under a heavy fire we succeeded in this\r\nmanoeuvre, Schaefer's brigade marching first, then the batteries, and\r\nRoberts's and Sill's brigades following.  When my division arrived on\r\nthis new ground, I posted Roberts on Negley's right, with Hescock's\r\nand Bush's guns, the brigade and guns occupying a low rocky ridge of\r\nlimestone, which faced them toward Murfreesboro', nearly south.  The\r\nrest of my division was aligned facing west, along the edge of a\r\ncedar thicket, the rear rank backed up on the right flank of Roberts,\r\nwith Houghtaling's battery in the angle.  This presented Sill's and\r\nSchaefer's brigades in an almost opposite direction to the line we\r\nhad so confidently taken up the night before, and covered Negley's\r\nrear.  The enemy, in the meantime, had continued his wheeling\r\nmovement till he occupied the ground that my batteries and reserve\r\nbrigade had held in the morning, and I had now so changed my position\r\nthat the left brigade of my division approached his intrenchments in\r\nfront of Stone River, while Sill's and Schaeffer's brigades, by\r\nfacing nearly west, confronted the successful troops that had smashed\r\nin our extreme right.\r\n\r\nI had hardly got straightened out in this last place when I was\r\nattacked by Cheatham's'division, which, notwithstanding the\r\nstaggering blows it had previously received from Sill and Roberts,\r\nnow again moved forward in conjunction with the wheeling movement\r\nunder the immediate command of Hardee.  One of the most sanguinary\r\ncontests of the day now took place.  In fulfillment of Bragg's\r\noriginal design no doubt, Cheatham's division attacked on my left,\r\nwhile heavy masses under Hardee, covered by batteries posted on the\r\nhigh ground formerly occupied by my guns, assaulted my right, the\r\nwhole force advancing simultaneously.  At the same time the enemy\r\nopened an artillery fire from his intrenchments in front of\r\nMurfreesboro', and it seemed that he was present on every side.  My\r\nposition was strong, however, located in the edge of a dense cedar\r\nthicket and commanding a slight depression of open ground that lay in\r\nmy front.  My men were in good spirits too, notwithstanding they had\r\nbeen a good deal hustled around since daylight, with losses that had\r\ntold considerably on their numbers.  Only a short distance now\r\nseparated the contending lines, and as the batteries on each side\r\nwere not much more than two hundred yards apart when the enemy made\r\nhis assault, the artillery fire was fearful in its effect on the\r\nranks of both contestants, the enemy's heavy masses staggering under\r\nthe torrent of shell and canister from our batteries, while our lines\r\nwere thinned by his ricochetting projectiles, that rebounded again\r\nand again over the thinly covered limestone formation and sped on to\r\nthe rear of Negley.  But all his efforts to dislodge or destroy us\r\nwere futile, and for the first time since daylight General Hardee was\r\nseriously checked in the turning movement he had begun for the\r\npurpose of getting possession of the Nashville pike, and though\r\nreinforced until two-fifths of Bragg's army was now at his command,\r\nyet he met with repulse after repulse, which created great gaps in\r\nhis lines and taught him that to overwhelm us was hopeless.\r\n\r\nAs the enemy was recoiling from his first attack, I received a\r\nmessage from Rosecrans telling me that he was making new\r\ndispositions, and directing me to hold on where I was until they were\r\ncompleted.  From this I judged that the existing conditions of the\r\nbattle would probably require a sacrifice of my command, so I\r\ninformed Roberts and Schaefer that we must be prepared to meet the\r\ndemand on us by withstanding the assault of the enemy, no matter what\r\nthe outcome.  Every energy was therefore bent to the simple holding\r\nof our ground, and as ammunition was getting scarce, instructions\r\nwere given throughout the command to have it reserve its fire till\r\nthe most effective moment.  In a little while came a second and a\r\nthird assault, and although they were as daring and furious as the\r\nfirst, yet in each case the Confederates were repulsed, driven back\r\nin confusion, but not without deadly loss to us, for the noble\r\nRoberts was killed, and Colonel Harrington, of the Twenty-Seventh\r\nIllinois, who succeeded to his brigade, was mortally wounded a few\r\nminutes later.  I had now on the death-roll three brigade commanders,\r\nand the loss of subordinate officers and men was appalling, but their\r\nsacrifice had accomplished the desired result; they had not fallen in\r\nvain.  Indeed, the bravery and tenacity of my division gave to\r\nRosecrans the time required to make new dispositions, and exacted\r\nfrom our foes the highest commendations.\r\n\r\nA lull followed the third fierce assault, and an investigation showed\r\nthat, with the exception of a few rounds in my brigade, our\r\nammunition was entirely exhausted; and while it was apparent that the\r\nenemy was reluctant to renew the conflict in my front, yet I was\r\nsatisfied I could not hold on much longer without the danger of\r\nultimate capture, so I prepared to withdraw as soon as the troops of\r\nRousseau's division, which had been ordered to take up a line on my\r\nright, came into position.  Schaefer's and Sill's brigades being\r\nwithout a cartridge, I directed them to fix bayonets for a charge,\r\nand await any attempt of the enemy to embarrass my retreat, while\r\nRoberts's brigade, offering such resistance as its small quantity of\r\nammunition would permit, was pulled slowly in toward the Nashville\r\npike.  Eighty of the horses of Houghtaling's battery having been\r\nkilled, an attempt was made to bring his guns back by hand over the\r\nrocky ground, but it could not be done, and we had to abandon them.\r\nHescock also had lost most of his horses, but all his guns were\r\nsaved.  Bush's battery lost two pieces, the tangled underbrush in the\r\ndense cedars proving an obstacle to getting them away which his\r\nalmost superhuman exertions could not surmount.  Thus far the bloody\r\nduel had cost me heavily, one-third of my division being killed or\r\nwounded.  I had already three brigade commanders killed; a little\r\nlater I lost my fourth--Colonel Schaefer.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of withdrawing were very great, as the ground was\r\nexceptionally rocky, and the growth of cedars almost impenetrable for\r\nwheeled carriages.  Retiring sullenly under a heavy fire, while the\r\ngeneral line was reformed to my right and rear, my division was at\r\nlength drawn through the cedars and debouched into an open space near\r\nthe Murfreesboro' pike, behind the right of Palmer's division.  Two\r\nregiments of Sill's brigade, however, on account of the conformation\r\nof the ground, were obliged to fall back from the point where\r\nWoodruff's brigade of Davis's division had rallied after the disaster\r\nof the early morning.  The division came out of the cedars with\r\nunbroken ranks, thinned by only its killed and wounded--but few\r\nmissing.  When we came into the open ground, McCook directed\r\nRoberts's brigade--now commanded by Colonel Luther P. Bradley--to\r\nproceed a short distance to the rear on the Nashville pike, to repel\r\nthe enemy's threatening attempt at our communications.  Willingly and\r\ncheerfully the brigade again entered the fight under these new\r\nconditions, and although it was supplied with but three or four\r\ncartridges to the man now, it charged gallantly and recaptured two\r\npieces of artillery which the Union troops had had to abandon at that\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nShortly after we debouched from the cedars I was directed by\r\nRosecrans to send some aid to the right of General Palmer's division;\r\nand two of Schaefer's regiments, having obtained ammunition, were\r\npushed up on Palmer's right, accompanied by four of Hescock's guns;\r\nbut the advance of the enemy here had already been checked by Palmer,\r\nand only a desultory contest ensued.  Rosecrans, whom I now met in\r\nthe open ground west of the railroad, behind Palmer, directed that my\r\ncommand should relieve Wood's division, which was required to fall\r\nback and take up the new line that had been marked out while I was\r\nholding on in the cedars.  His usually florid face had lost its ruddy\r\ncolor, and his anxious eyes told that the disasters of the morning\r\nwere testing his powers to the very verge of endurance, but he seemed\r\nfully to comprehend what had befallen us.  His firmly set lips and,\r\nthe calmness with which his instructions were delivered inspired\r\nconfidence in all around him; and expressing approbation of what my\r\ndivision had done, while deliberately directing it to a new point, he\r\nrenewed in us all the hope of final victory, though it must be\r\nadmitted that at this phase of the battle the chances lay largely\r\nwith the enemy.\r\n\r\nWithdrawing the two regiments and Hescock's battery, that I had\r\nposted on the right of Palmer, I moved as directed by Rosecrans into\r\nthe position to the east of the railroad, and formed immediately to\r\nthe right of Wood, who was now being attacked all along his front,\r\nbut more particularly where his right rested near the railroad.\r\nUnder a storm of shot and shell that came in torrents my troops took\r\nup the new ground, advancing through a clump of open timber to Wood's\r\nassistance.  Forming in line in front of the timber we poured a\r\ntelling fire into the enemy's ranks, which were then attacking across\r\nsome cleared fields; but when he discovered additional troops\r\nconfronting him, he gave up the attempt to carry Wood's position.  It\r\nwas here that I lost Schaefer, who was killed instantly, making my\r\nfourth brigade commander dead that day.  The enemy in front of Wood\r\nhaving been checked, our whole line east of the railroad executed\r\nundisturbed its retrograde movement to a position about three hundred\r\nyards to its rear.  When I fell back to the edge of the clump of\r\ntimber, where when first coming on the ground I had formed to help\r\nWood, I was ordered by Rosecrans to prepare to make a charge should\r\nthe enemy again assault us.  In anticipation of this work I massed my\r\ntroops in close column.  The expected attack never came, however, but\r\nthe shot and shell of a furious cannonade told with fatal effect upon\r\nmen and officers as they lay on their faces hugging the ground.  The\r\ntorments of this trying situation were almost unbearable, but it was\r\nobvious to all that it was necessary to have at hand a compact body\r\nof troops to repel any assault the enemy might make pending the\r\nreconstruction of the extreme right of our line, and a silent\r\ndetermination to stay seemed to take hold of each individual soldier;\r\nnor was this grim silence interrupted throughout the cannonade,\r\nexcept in one instance, when one of the regiments broke out in a\r\nlusty cheer as a startled rabbit in search of a new hiding-place\r\nsafely ran the whole length of the line on the backs of the men.\r\n\r\nWhile my troops were still lying here, General Rosecrans, with a part\r\nof his staff and a few orderlies, rode out on the rearranged line to\r\nsupervise its formation and encourage the men, and in prosecution of\r\nthese objects moved around the front of my column of attack, within\r\nrange of the batteries that were shelling us so viciously.  As he\r\npassed to the open ground on my left, I joined him.  The enemy seeing\r\nthis mounted party, turned his guns upon it, and his accurate aim was\r\nsoon rewarded, for a solid shot carried away the head of Colonel\r\nGaresche, the chief-of-staff, and killed or wounded two or three\r\norderlies.  Garesche's appalling death stunned us all, and a\r\nmomentary expression of horror spread over Rosecrans's face; but at\r\nsuch a time the importance of self-control was vital, and he pursued\r\nhis course with an appearance of indifference, which, however, those\r\nimmediately about him saw was assumed, for undoubtedly he felt most\r\ndeeply the death of his friend and trusted staff-officer.\r\n\r\nNo other attacks were made on us to the east of the railroad for the\r\nrest of the afternoon, and just before dark I was directed to\r\nwithdraw and take up a position along the west side of the Nashville\r\npike, on the extreme right of our new line, where Roberts's brigade\r\nand the Seventy-third and Eighty-eighth Illinois had already been\r\nplaced by McCook.  The day had cost me much anxiety and sadness, and\r\nI was sorely disappointed at the general result, though I could not\r\nbe other than pleased at the part taken by my command.  The loss of\r\nmy brigade commanders--Sill, Roberts, Schaefer, and Harrington-and a\r\nlarge number of regimental and battery officers, with so many of\r\ntheir men, struck deep into my heart: My thinned ranks told the\r\nwoeful tale of the fierce struggles, indescribable by words, through\r\nwhich my division had passed since 7 o'clock in the morning; and\r\nthis, added to our hungry and exhausted condition, was naturally\r\ndisheartening.  The men had been made veterans, however, by the\r\nfortunes and misfortunes of the day, and as they went into their new\r\nplaces still confident of final success, it was plain to see that\r\nthey felt a self-confidence inspired by the part they had already\r\nplayed.\r\n\r\nMy headquarters were now established on the Nashville pike, about\r\nthree miles and a half from Murfreesboro'; my division being aligned\r\nto the west of the pike, bowed out and facing almost west, Cleburn's\r\ndivision of the Confederates confronting it.  Davis's division was\r\nposted on my right, and Walker's brigade of Thomas's corps, which had\r\nreported to me, took up a line that connected my left with Johnson's\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening General Rosecrans, accompanied by General McCook,\r\nand several other officers whose names I am now unable to recall,\r\nrode by my headquarters on their way to the rear to look for a new\r\nline of battle--on Overall's creek it was said--that would preserve\r\nour communications with Nashville and offer better facilities for\r\nresistance than the one we were now holding.  Considerable time had\r\nelapsed when they returned from this exploration and proceeded to\r\ntheir respective commands, without intimating to me that anything had\r\nbeen determined upon by the reconnoissance, but a little later it was\r\nrumored through the different headquarters that while the party was\r\nlooking for a new position it discovered the enemy's troops moving\r\ntoward our right and rear, the head of his columns being conducted in\r\nthe darkness by the aid of torches, and that no alternative was left\r\nus but to hold the lines we then occupied.  The torches had been seen\r\nunquestionably, and possibly created some alarm at first in the minds\r\nof the reconnoitring party, but it was soon ascertained that the\r\nlights came from a battalion of the Fourth regular cavalry that was\r\npicketing our flank and happened to be starting its bivouac fires at\r\nthe moment.  The fires and the supposed movements had no weight,\r\ntherefore, in deciding the proposition to take up a line at Overall's\r\ncreek, but General Rosecrans, fortunately for the army, decided to\r\nremain where he was.  Doubtless reflections during his ride caused\r\nhim to realize that the enemy must be quite as much crippled as\r\nhimself.  If it had been decided to fall back to Overall's creek, we\r\ncould have withdrawn without much difficulty very likely, but such a\r\nretrograde movement would have left to the enemy the entire\r\nbattle-field of Stone River and ultimately compelled our retreat\r\nto Nashville.\r\n\r\nIn the night of December 3rd several slight demonstrations were made\r\non my front, but from the darkness neither party felt the effect of\r\nthe other's fire, and when daylight came again the skirmishers and\r\nlines of battle were in about the same position they had taken up the\r\nevening before.  Soon after daybreak it became evident that the\r\nconflict was to be renewed, and a little later the enemy resumed the\r\noffensive by an attack along my left front, especially on Walker's\r\nbrigade.  His attempt was ineffectual, however, and so easily\r\nrepulsed as to demonstrate that the desperate character of his\r\nassaults the day before had nearly exhausted his strength.  About 3\r\no'clock in the afternoon he made another feeble charge on my front,\r\nbut our fire from the barricades and rifle-pits soon demoralized his\r\nadvancing lines, which fell back in some confusion, thus enabling us\r\nto pick up about a hundred prisoners.  From this time till the\r\nevening of January 3 Bragg's left remained in our front, and\r\ncontinued to show itself at intervals by weak demonstrations, which\r\nwe afterward ascertained were directly intended to cover the\r\ndesperate assault he made with Breckenridge on the left of Rosecrans,\r\nan assault that really had in view only a defensive purpose, for\r\nunless Bragg dislodged the troops which were now massing in front of\r\nhis right he would be obliged to withdraw General Polk's corps behind\r\nStone River and finally abandon Murfreesboro'.  The sequel proved\r\nthis to be the case; and the ill-judged assault led by Breckenridge\r\nending in entire defeat, Bragg retired from Murfreesboro' the night\r\nof January 3.\r\n\r\nGeneral Rosecrans occupied Murfreesboro' on the 4th and 5th, having\r\ngained a costly victory, which was not decisive enough in its\r\ncharacter to greatly affect the general course of the war, though it\r\nsomewhat strengthened and increased our hold on Middle Tennessee.\r\nThe enemy in retiring did not fall back very far--only behind Duck\r\nRiver to Shelbyville and Tullahoma--and but little endeavor was made\r\nto follow him.  Indeed, we were not in condition to pursue, even if\r\nit had been the intention at the outset of the campaign.\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible after the Confederate retreat I went over the\r\nbattle-field to collect such of my wounded as had not been carried\r\noff to the South and to bury my dead.  In the cedars and on the\r\nground where I had been so fiercely assaulted when the battle opened,\r\non the morning of the 31st, evidences of the bloody struggle appeared\r\non every hand in the form of broken fire-arms, fragments of\r\naccoutrements, and splintered trees.  The dead had nearly all been\r\nleft unburied, but as there was likelihood of their mutilation by\r\nroving swine, the bodies had mostly been collected in piles at\r\ndifferent points and inclosed by rail fences.  The sad duties of\r\ninterment and of caring for the wounded were completed by the 5th,\r\nand on the 6th I moved my division three miles, south of\r\nMurfreesboro' on the Shelbyville pike, going into camp on the banks\r\nof Stone River.  Here the condition of my command was thoroughly\r\nlooked into, and an endeavor made to correct such defects as had been\r\ndisclosed by the recent battle.\r\n\r\nDuring the engagement there had been little straggling, and my list\r\nof missing was small and legitimate; still, it was known that a very\r\nfew had shirked their duty, and an example was necessary.  Among this\r\nsmall number were four officers who, it was charged, had abandoned\r\ntheir colors and regiments.  When their guilt was clearly\r\nestablished, and as soon as an opportunity occurred, I caused the\r\nwhole division to be formed in a hollow square, closed in mass, and\r\nhad the four officers marched to the centre, where, telling them that\r\nI would not humiliate any officer or soldier by requiring him to\r\ntouch their disgraced swords, I compelled them to deliver theirs up\r\nto my colored servant, who also cut from their coats every insignia\r\nof rank.  Then, after there had been read to the command an order\r\nfrom army headquarters dismissing the four from the service, the\r\nscene was brought to a close by drumming the cowards out of camp.  It\r\nwas a mortifying spectacle, but from that day no officer in that\r\ndivision ever abandoned his colors.\r\n\r\nMy effective force in the battle of Stone River was 4,154 officers\r\nand men.  Of this number I lost 1,633 killed, wounded, and missing,\r\nor nearly 40 per cent.  In the remaining years of the war, though\r\noften engaged in most severe contests, I never experienced in any of\r\nmy commands so high a rate of casualties.  The ratio of loss in the\r\nwhole of Rosecrans's army was also high, and Bragg's losses were\r\nalmost equally great.  Rosecrans carried into the action about 42,000\r\nofficers and men.  He lost 13,230, or 31 per cent.  Bragg's effective\r\nforce was 37,800 officers and men; he lost 10,306, or nearly 28 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nThough our victory was dearly bought, yet the importance of gaining\r\nthe day at any price was very great, particularly when we consider\r\nwhat might have been the result had not the gallantry of the army and\r\nthe manoeuvring during the early disaster saved us from ultimate\r\ndefeat.  We had started out from Nashville on an offensive campaign,\r\nprobably with no intention of going beyond Murfreesboro', in\r\nmidwinter, but still with the expectation of delivering a crushing\r\nblow should the enemy accept our challenge to battle.  He met us with\r\na plan of attack almost the counterpart of our own.  In the execution\r\nof his plan he had many advantages, not the least of which was his\r\nintimate knowledge of the ground, and he came near destroying us.\r\nHad he done so, Nashville would probably have fallen; at all events,\r\nKentucky would have been opened again to his incursions, and the\r\ntheatre of war very likely transferred once more to the Ohio River.\r\nAs the case now stood, however, Nashville was firmly established as a\r\nbase for future operations, Kentucky was safe from the possibility of\r\nbeing again overrun, and Bragg, thrown on the defensive, was\r\ncompelled to give his thoughts to the protection of the interior of\r\nthe Confederacy and the security of Chattanooga, rather than indulge\r\nin schemes of conquest north of the Cumberland River.  While he still\r\nheld on in Middle Tennessee his grasp was so much loosened that only\r\nslight effort would be necessary to push him back into Georgia, and\r\nthus give to the mountain region of East Tennessee an opportunity to\r\nprove its loyalty to the Union.\r\n\r\nThe victory quieted the fears of the West and Northwest, destroyed\r\nthe hopes of the secession element in Kentucky, renewed the drooping\r\nspirits of the East Tennesseans, and demoralized the disunionists in\r\nMiddle Tennessee; yet it was a negative victory so far as concerned\r\nthe result on the battle-field.  Rosecrans seems to have planned the\r\nbattle with the idea that the enemy would continue passive, remain\r\nentirely on the defensive, and that it was necessary only to push\r\nforward our left in order to force the evacuation of Murfreesboro';\r\nand notwithstanding the fact that on the afternoon of December 30\r\nMcCook received information that the right of Johnson's division.\r\nresting near the Franklin pike, extended only to about the centre of\r\nthe Confederate army, it does not appear that attack from that\r\nquarter was at all apprehended by the Union commanders.\r\n\r\nThe natural line of retreat of the Confederates was not threatened by\r\nthe design of Rosecrans; and Bragg, without risk to his\r\ncommunications, anticipated it by a counter-attack of like character\r\nfrom his own left, and demolished his adversary's plan the moment we\r\nwere thrown on the defensive.  Had Bragg followed up with the spirit\r\nwhich characterized its beginning the successful attack by Hardee on\r\nour right wing--and there seems no reason why he should not have done\r\nso--the army of Rosecrans still might have got back to Nashville, but\r\nit would have been depleted and demoralized to such a degree as to\r\nunfit it for offensive operations for a long time afterward.  Bragg's\r\nintrenchments in front of Stone River were very strong, and there\r\nseems no reason why he should not have used his plain advantage as\r\nexplained, but instead he allowed us to gain time, intrench, and\r\nrecover a confidence that at first was badly shaken.  Finally, to cap\r\nthe climax of his errors, he directed Breckenridge to make the\r\nassault from his right flank on January 2, with small chance for\r\nanything but disaster, when the real purpose in view could have been\r\naccomplished without the necessity of any offensive manoeuvre\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nAPPOINTED A MAJOR-GENERAL--THE SECRET EXPEDITION UNDER CARD THE\r\nSCOUT--HIS CAPTURE BY GUERRILLAS--ESCAPE--A REVENGE PARTY--WOMEN\r\nSOLDIERS--A FIGHT WITH SABRES--TULLAHOMA CAMPAIGN--A FOOLISH\r\nADVENTURE.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of January, 1863, my division settled quietly down in its\r\ncamp south of Murfreesboro'.  Its exhausted condition after the\r\nterrible experiences of the preceding week required attention.  It\r\nneeded recuperation, reinforcement, and reorganization, and I set\r\nabout these matters without delay, in anticipation of active\r\noperations early in the spring.  No forward movement was made for\r\nnearly six months, however, and throughout this period drills,\r\nparades, reconnoissances, and foraging expeditions filled in the time\r\nprofitably.  In addition to these exercises the construction of\r\npermanent fortifications for the security of Murfreesboro' was\r\nundertaken by General Rosecrans, and large details from my troops\r\nwere furnished daily for the work.  Much attention was also given to\r\ncreating a more perfect system of guard and picket duty-a matter that\r\nhad hitherto been somewhat neglected in the army, as its constant\r\nactivity had permitted scant opportunity for the development of such\r\na system.  It was at this time that I received my appointment as a\r\nmajor-general of Volunteers.  My promotion had been recommended by\r\nGeneral Rosecrans immediately after the battle of Stone River, but\r\nfor some reason it was delayed until April, and though a long time\r\nelapsed between the promise and the performance, my gratification was\r\nextreme.\r\n\r\nMy scout, Card, was exceedingly useful while encamped near\r\nMurfreesboro, making several trips to East Tennessee within the\r\nenemy's lines to collect information as to the condition of the loyal\r\npeople there, and to encourage them with the hope of early\r\nliberation.  He also brought back from each trip very accurate\r\nstatements as to the strength and doings of the Confederate army,\r\nfixing almost with certainty its numbers and the locations of its\r\ndifferent divisions, and enabling my engineer-officer--Major\r\nMorhardt--to construct good maps of the country in our front.  On\r\nthese dangerous excursions Card was always accompanied by one of his\r\nbrothers, the other remaining with me to be ready for duty if any\r\naccident occurred to those who had gone out, or in case I wanted to\r\ncommunicate with them.  In this way we kept well posted, although the\r\nintelligence these men brought was almost always secured at the risk\r\nof their lives.\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring, before the Tullahoma campaign began, I thought\r\nit would be practicable, by sending out a small secret expedition of\r\nbut three or four men, to break the Nashville and Chattanooga\r\nrailroad between Chattanooga and the enemy's position at Tullahoma by\r\nburning the bridges in Crow Creek valley from its head to Stevenson,\r\nAlabama, and then the great bridge across the Tennessee River at\r\nBridgeport.  Feeling confident that I could persuade Card to\r\nundertake the perilous duty, I broached the contemplated project to\r\nhim, and he at once jumped at the opportunity of thus distinguishing\r\nhimself, saying that with one of his brothers and three other loyal\r\nEast Tennesseeans, whose services he knew could be enlisted, he felt\r\nsure of carrying out the idea, so I gave him authority to choose his\r\nown assistants.  In a few days his men appeared at my headquarters,\r\nand when supplied with money in notes of the State Bank of Tennessee,\r\ncurrent everywhere as gold in those days, the party, composed of\r\nCard, the second brother, and the three East Tennesseeans, started on\r\ntheir precarious enterprise, their course being directed first toward\r\nthe Cumberland Mountains, intending to strike the Nashville and\r\nChattanooga railroad somewhere above Anderson's station.  They\r\nexpected to get back in about fifteen days, but I looked for some\r\nknowledge of the progress of their adventure before the expiration of\r\nthat period, hoping to hear through Confederate sources prisoners and\r\nthe like-of the destruction of the bridges.  I waited in patience for\r\nsuch news, but none came, and as the time Card had allotted himself\r\npassed by, I watched anxiously for his return, for, as there was\r\nscarcely a doubt that the expedition had proved a failure, the fate\r\nof the party became a matter of deep concern to Card's remaining\r\nbrother and to me.  Finally this brother volunteered to go to his\r\nfather's house in East Tennessee to get tidings of the party, and I\r\nconsented, for the probabilities were that some of them had made\r\ntheir way to that point, or at least that some information had\r\nreached there about them.  As day after day went by, the time fixed\r\nfor this brother's return came round, yet he also remained out; but\r\nsome days after the lad was due Card himself turned up accompanied by\r\nthe brother he had taken with him, soon explained his delay in\r\ngetting back, and gave me the story of his adventures while absent.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving my camp, his party had followed various byways across\r\nthe Cumberland Mountains to Crow Creek Valley, as instructed; but\r\nwhen nearing the railroad above Anderson's Station, they were\r\ncaptured by some guerrillas prowling about that vicinity, and being\r\nsuspected of disloyalty to the Confederacy, were carried to\r\nChattanooga and imprisoned as Yankee spies.  Their prospects now were\r\ndecidedly discouraging, for death stared them in the face.\r\nFortunately, however, some delays occurred relative to the\r\ndisposition that should be made of them, and they, meanwhile,\r\neffected their escape from their jailors by way of one of the prison\r\nwindows, from which they managed to displace a bar, and by a skiff,\r\nin the darkness of night, crossed the Tennessee River a little below\r\nChattanooga.  From this point the party made their way back to my\r\ncamp, traveling only at night, hiding in the woods by day, and for\r\nfood depending on loyal citizens that Card had become acquainted with\r\nwhen preaching and peddling.\r\n\r\nCard's first inquiry after relating his story was for the youngest\r\nbrother, whom he had left with me.  I told him what I had done, in my\r\nanxiety about himself, and that more than sufficient time had elapsed\r\nfor his brother's return.  His reply was: \"They have caught him.  The\r\npoor fellow is dead.\"  His surmise proved correct; for news soon came\r\nthat the poor boy had been captured at his father's house, and\r\nhanged.  The blow to Card was a severe one, and so hardened his heart\r\nagainst the guerrillas in the neighborhood of his father's home--for\r\nhe knew they were guilty of his brother's murder--that it was with\r\ndifficulty I could persuade him to continue in the employment of the\r\nGovernment, so determined was he to avenge his brother's death at the\r\nfirst opportunity.  Finally, however, I succeeded in quieting the\r\nalmost uncontrollable rage that seemed to possess him, and he\r\nremained with me during the Tullahoma and Chickamauga campaigns; but\r\nwhen we reached Knoxville the next winter, he took his departure,\r\ninforming me that he was going for the bushwhackers who had killed\r\nhis brother.  A short time after he left me, I saw him at the head of\r\nabout thirty well-armed East Tennesseeans--refugees.  They were\r\ndetermined-looking men, seeking revenge for the wrongs and sufferings\r\nthat had been put upon them in the last two years, and no doubt\r\nwreaked their vengeance right and left on all who had been in any way\r\ninstrumental in persecuting them.\r\n\r\nThe feeding of our army from the base at Louisville was attended with\r\na great many difficulties, as the enemy's cavalry was constantly\r\nbreaking the railroad and intercepting our communications on the\r\nCumberland River at different points that were easily accessible to\r\nhis then superior force of troopers.  The accumulation of reserve\r\nstores was therefore not an easy task, and to get forage ahead a few\r\ndays was well-nigh impossible, unless that brought from the North was\r\nsupplemented by what we could gather from the country.  Corn was\r\nabundant in the region to the south and southwest of Murfreesboro',\r\nso to make good our deficiences in this respect, I employed a brigade\r\nabout once a week in the duty of collecting and bringing in forage,\r\nsending out sometimes as many as a hundred and fifty wagons to haul\r\nthe grain which my scouts had previously located.  In nearly every\r\none of these expeditions the enemy was encountered, and the wagons\r\nwere usually loaded while the skirmishers kept up a running fire,\r\nOften there would occur a respectable brush, with the loss on each\r\nside of a number of killed and wounded.  The officer in direct\r\ncommand always reported to me personally whatever had happened during\r\nthe time he was out--the result of his reconnoissance, so to speak,\r\nfor that war the real nature of these excursions--and on one occasion\r\nthe colonel in command, Colonel Conrad, of the Fifteenth Missouri,\r\ninformed me that he got through without much difficulty; in fact,\r\nthat everything had gone all right and been eminently satisfactory,\r\nexcept that in returning he had been mortified greatly by the conduct\r\nof the two females belonging to the detachment and division train at\r\nmy headquarters.  These women, he said, had given much annoyance by\r\ngetting drunk, and to some extent demoralizing his men.  To say that\r\nI was astonished at his statement would be a mild way of putting it,\r\nand had I not known him to be a most upright man and of sound sense,\r\nI should have doubted not only his veracity, but his sanity.\r\nInquiring who they were and for further details, I was informed that\r\nthere certainly were in the command two females, that in some\r\nmysterious manner had attached themselves to the service as soldiers;\r\nthat one, an East Tennessee woman, was a teamster in the division\r\nwagon-train and the other a private soldier in a cavalry company\r\ntemporarily attached to my headquarters for escort duty.  While out\r\non the foraging expedition these Amazons had secured a supply of\r\n\"apple-jack\" by some means, got very drunk, and on the return had\r\nfallen into Stone River and been nearly drowned.  After they had been\r\nfished from, the water, in the process of resuscitation their sex was\r\ndisclosed, though up to this time it appeared to be known only to\r\neach other.  The story was straight and the circumstance clear,\r\nso, convinced of Conrad's continued sanity, I directed the\r\nprovost-marshal to bring in arrest to my headquarters the two\r\ndisturbers of Conrad's peace of mind, After some little search the\r\nEast Tennessee woman was found in camp, somewhat the worse for the\r\nexperiences of the day before, but awaiting her fate content idly\r\nsmoking a cob-pipe.  She was brought to me, and put in duress under\r\ncharge of the division surgeon until her companion could be secured.\r\nTo the doctor she related that the year before she had \"refugeed\" from\r\nEast Tennessee, and on arriving in Louisville assumed men's apparel\r\nand sought and obtained employment as a teamster in the\r\nquartermaster's department.  Her features were very large, and so\r\ncoarse and masculine was her general appearance that she would readily\r\nhave passed as a man, and in her case the deception was no doubt\r\neasily practiced.  Next day the \"she dragoon\" was caught, and proved\r\nto be a rather prepossessing young woman, and though necessarily\r\nbronzed and hardened by exposure, I doubt if, even with these marks of\r\ncampaigning, she could have deceived as readily as did her companion.\r\nHow the two got acquainted, I never learned, and though they had\r\njoined the army independently of each other, yet an intimacy had\r\nsprung up between them long before the mishaps of the foraging\r\nexpedition.  They both were forwarded to army headquarters, and, when\r\nprovided with clothing suited to their sex, sent back to Nashville,\r\nand thence beyond our lines to Louisville.\r\n\r\nOn January 9, by an order from the War Department, the Army of the\r\nCumberland had been divided into three corps, designated the\r\nFourteenth, Twentieth, and Twenty-first.  This order did not alter the\r\ncomposition of the former grand divisions, nor change the commanders,\r\nbut the new nomenclature was a decided improvement over the clumsy\r\ndesignations Right Wing, Centre, and Left Wing, which were well\r\ncalculated to lead to confusion sometimes.  McCook's wing became the\r\nTwentieth Corps, and my division continued of the same organization,\r\nand held the same number as formerly-the Third Division, Twentieth\r\nCorps.  My first brigade was now commanded by Brigadier-General\r\nWilliam H. Lytle, the second by Colonel Bernard Laiboldt, and the\r\nthird by Colonel Luther P. Bradley.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of March I was directed to move in light marching order\r\ntoward Franklin and join General Gordon Granger, to take part in some\r\noperations which he was projecting against General Earl Van Dorn,\r\nthen at Spring Hill.  Knowing that my line of march would carry me\r\nthrough a region where forage was plentiful, I took along a large\r\ntrain of empty wagons, which I determined to fill with corn and send\r\nback to Murfreesboro', believing that I could successfully cover the\r\ntrain by Minty's brigade of cavalry, which had joined me for the\r\npurpose of aiding in a reconnoissance toward Shelbyville.  In\r\nmarching the column I placed a regiment of infantry at its head, then\r\nthe wagon-train, then a brigade of infantry--masking the cavalry\r\nbehind this brigade.  The enemy, discovering that the train was with\r\nus, and thinking he could capture it, came boldly out with his,\r\ncavalry to attack.  The head of his column came up to the crossroads\r\nat Versailles, but holding him there, I passed the train and infantry\r\nbrigade beyond toward Eagleville, and when my cavalry had been thus\r\nunmasked, Minty, followed by the balance of my division, which was\r\nstill behind, charged him with the sabre.  Success was immediate and\r\ncomplete, and pursuit of the routed forces continued through\r\nUnionville, until we fell upon and drove in the Confederate outposts\r\nat Shelbyville.  Here the enemy was taken by surprise evidently,\r\nwhich was most fortunate for us, otherwise the consequences might\r\nhave been disastrous.  Minty captured in the charge about fifty\r\nprisoners and a few wagons and mules, and thus enabled me to load my\r\ntrain with corn, and send it back to Murfreesboro' unmolested.  In\r\nthis little fight the sabre was freely used by both sides, and I do\r\nnot believe that during the whole war I again knew of so large a\r\npercentage of wounds by that arm in proportion to the numbers\r\nengaged.\r\n\r\nThat night I encamped at Eagleville, and next day reported to Granger\r\nat Franklin, arriving in the midst of much excitement prevailing on\r\naccount of the loss of Coburn's brigade, which had been captured the\r\nday before a little distance south of that point, while marching to\r\nform a junction with a column that had been directed on Columbia from\r\nMurfreesboro'.  Shortly after Coburn's capture General Granger had\r\ncome upon the scene, and the next day he advanced my division and\r\nMinty's troops directly on Spring Hill, with a view to making some\r\nreprisal; but Van Dorn had no intention of accommodating us, and\r\nretired from Spring Hill, offering but little resistance.  He\r\ncontinued to fall back, till finally he got behind Duck River, where\r\noperations against him ceased; for, in consequence of the incessant\r\nrains of the season, the streams had become almost impassable.\r\nLater, I returned by way of Franklin to my old camp at Murfreesboro',\r\npassing over on this march the ground on which the Confederate\r\nGeneral Hood met with such disaster the following year in his attack\r\non Stanley's corps.\r\n\r\nMy command had all returned from the Franklin expedition to\r\nMurfreesboro' and gone into camp on the Salem pike by the latter part\r\nof March, from which time till June it took part in only the little\r\naffairs of outposts occurring every now and then on my own front.  In\r\nthe meanwhile General Rosecrans had been materially reinforced by the\r\nreturn of sick and wounded men; his army had become well disciplined,\r\nand was tolerably supplied; and he was repeatedly pressed by the\r\nauthorities at Washington to undertake offensive operations.\r\n\r\nDuring the spring and early summer Rosecrans resisted, with a great\r\ndeal of spirit and on various grounds, these frequent urgings, and\r\nout of this grew up an acrimonious correspondence and strained\r\nfeeling between him and General Halleck.  Early in June, however,\r\nstores had been accumulated and other preparations made for a move\r\nforward, Resecrans seeming to have decided that he could safely risk\r\nan advance, with the prospect of good results.  Before finally\r\ndeciding, he called upon most of his corps and division commanders\r\nfor their opinions on certain propositions which he presented, and\r\nmost of them still opposed the projected movement, I among the\r\nnumber, reasoning that while General Grant was operating against\r\nVicksburg, it was better to hold Bragg in Middle Tennessee than to\r\npush him so far back into Georgia that interior means of\r\ncommunication would give the Confederate Government the opportunity\r\nof quickly joining a part of his force to that of General Johnson in\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nAt this stage, and in fact prior to it, Rosecrans seemed to manifest\r\nspecial confidence in me, often discussing his plans with me\r\nindependent of the occasions on which he formally referred them for\r\nmy views.  I recollect that on two different occasions about this\r\ntime he unfolded his designs to me in this informal way, outlining\r\ngenerally how he expected ultimately to force Bragg south of the\r\nTennessee River, and going into the details of the contemplated move\r\non Tullahoma.  His schemes, to my mind, were not only comprehensive,\r\nbut exact, and showed conclusively, what no one doubted then, that\r\nthey were original with him.  I found in them very little to\r\ncriticise unfavorably, if we were to move at all, and Rosecrans\r\ncertainly impressed me that he favored an advance at an early day,\r\nthough many of his generals were against it until the operations on\r\nthe Mississippi River should culminate in something definite.  There\r\nwas much, fully apparent in the circumstances about his headquarters,\r\nleading to the conviction that Rosecrans originated the Tullahoma\r\ncampaign, and the record of his prior performances collaterally\r\nsustains the visible evidence then existing.  In my opinion, then,\r\nbased on a clear recollection of various occurrences growing out of\r\nour intimacy, he conceived the plan of the Tullahoma campaign and the\r\none succeeding it; and is therefore entitled to every credit that\r\nattended their execution, no matter what may be claimed for others.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of June Bragg was covering his position north of Duck\r\nRiver with a front extending from McMinnville, where his cavalry\r\nrested, through Wartrace and Shelbyville to Columbia, his depot being\r\nat Tullahoma.  Rosecrans, thinking that Bragg would offer strong\r\nresistance at Shelbyville--which was somewhat protected by a spur\r\nof low mountains or hills, offshoots of the Cumberland Mountains\r\n--decided to turn that place; consequently, he directed the mass\r\nof the Union army on the enemy's right flank, about Manchester.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of June McCook's corps advanced toward Liberty Gap, my\r\ndivisions marching on the Shelbyville pike.  I had proceeded but a\r\nfew miles when I encountered the enemy's pickets, who fell back to\r\nChristiana, about nine miles from Murfreesboro'.  Here I was assailed\r\npretty wickedly by the enemy's sharpshooters and a section of\r\nartillery, but as I was instructed to do nothing more than cover the\r\nroad from Eagleville, over which Brannan's division was to approach\r\nChristiana, I made little reply to this severe annoyance, wishing to\r\nconceal the strength of my force.  As soon as the head of Brannan's\r\ncolumn arrived I marched across-country to the left, and encamped\r\nthat night at the little town of Millersburg, in the vicinity of\r\nLiberty Gap.  I was directed to move from Millersburg, on Hoover's\r\nGap--a pass in the range of hills already referred to, through which\r\nran the turnpike from Murfreesboro' to Manchester--but heavy rains\r\nhad made the country roads almost impassable, and the last of my\r\ndivision did not reach Hoover's Gap till the morning of June 27,\r\nafter its abandonment by the enemy.  Continuing on to Fairfield, the\r\nhead of my column met, south of that place, a small force of\r\nConfederate infantry and cavalry, which after a slight skirmish\r\nLaiboldt's brigade drove back toward Wartrace.  The next morning I\r\narrived at Manchester, where I remained quiet for the day.  Early on\r\nthe 29th I marched by the Lynchburg road for Tullahoma, where the\r\nenemy was believed to be in force, and came into position about six\r\nmiles from the town.\r\n\r\nBy the 31st the whole army had been concentrated, in spite of many\r\ndifficulties, and though, on account of the heavy rains that had\r\nfallen almost incessantly since we left Murfreesboro', its movements\r\nhad been slow and somewhat inaccurate, yet the precision with which\r\nit took up a line of battle for an attack on Tullahoma showed that\r\nforethought and study had been given to every detail.  The enemy had\r\ndetermined to fall back from Tullahoma at the beginning of the\r\ncampaign, however, and as we advanced, his evacuation had so far\r\nprogressed that when, on July 1.  We reached the earthworks thrown.\r\nup early in the year for the defense of the place, he had almost\r\nwholly disappeared, carrying off all his stores and munitions of war\r\nexcept some little subsistence and eleven pieces of artillery.  A\r\nstrong rearguard remained to cover the retreat, and on my front the\r\nusual encounters between advancing and retreating forces took place.\r\nJust before reaching the intrenchments on the Lynchburg road, I came\r\nupon an open space that was covered by a network of fallen trees and\r\nunderbrush, which had been slashed all along in front of the enemy's\r\nearthworks.  This made our progress very difficult, but I shortly\r\nbecame satisfied that there were only a few of the enemy within the\r\nworks, so moving a battalion of cavalry that had joined me the day\r\nbefore down the road as rapidly as the obstructions would permit, the\r\nConfederate pickets quickly departed, and we gained possession of the\r\ntown.  Three siege guns, four caissons, a few stores, and a small\r\nnumber of prisoners fell into my hands.\r\n\r\nThat same evening orders were issued to the army to push on from\r\nTullahoma in pursuit, for, as it was thought that we might not be\r\nable to cross Elk River on account of its swollen condition, we could\r\ndo the enemy some damage by keeping close as possible at his heels.\r\nI marched on the Winchester road at 3 o'clock on the 2d of July and\r\nabout 8 o'clock reached Elk River ford.  The stream was for the time\r\ntruly an impassable torrent, and all hope of crossing by the\r\nWinchester ford had to be abandoned.  Deeming that further effort\r\nshould be made, however, under guidance of Card, I turned the head of\r\nmy column in the direction of Alisona, marching up the river and\r\nnearly parallel with it till I came to Rock Creek.  With a little\r\ndelay we got across Rock Creek, which was also much swollen, and\r\nfinding a short distance above its mouth a ford on Elk River that\r\nCard said was practicable, I determined to attempt it: Some of the\r\nenemy's cavalry were guarding this ford, but after a sharp little\r\nskirmish my battalion of cavalry crossed and took up a strong\r\nposition on the other bank.  The stream was very high and the current\r\nvery swift, the water, tumbling along over its rocky bed in an\r\nimmense volume, but still it was fordable for infantry if means could\r\nbe devised by which the men could keep their feet.  A cable was\r\nstretched across just below the ford as a lifeline for the weaker\r\nones, and then the men of the entire division having secured their\r\nammunition by placing the cartridge-boxes on their shoulders, the\r\ncolumn pushed cheerfully into the rushing current.  The men as they\r\nentered the water joined each other in sets of four in a close\r\nembrace, which enabled them to retain a foothold and successfully\r\nresist the force of the flood.  When they were across I turned the\r\ncolumn down the left bank of Elk River, and driving the enemy from\r\nsome slight works near Estelle Springs, regained the Winchester road.\r\n\r\nBy this time it was clear that Bragg intended to fall back behind the\r\nTennessee River, and our only chance of accomplishing anything of\r\nimportance was to smash up his rear-guard before it crossed the\r\nCumberland Mountains, and in pursuance of this idea I was directed to\r\nattack such of his force as was holding on to Winchester.  At 4\r\no'clock on the morning of July 2 I moved on that town, and when we\r\ngot close to it directed my mounted troops to charge a small force of\r\nConfederate cavalry that was picketing their front.  The Confederates\r\nresisted but little, and our men went with them in a disorderly chase\r\nthrough the village to Boiling Fork, a small stream about half a mile\r\nbeyond.  Here the fleeing pickets, rallying behind a stronger force,\r\nmade a stand, and I was directed by McCook to delay till I\r\nascertained if Davis's division, which was to support me, had made\r\nthe crossing of Elk River, and until I could open up communication\r\nwith Brannan's division, which was to come in on my left at Decherd.\r\nAs soon as I learned that Davis was across I pushed on, but the delay\r\nhad permitted the enemy to pull his rear-guard up on the mountain,\r\nand rendered nugatory all further efforts to hurt him materially, our\r\nonly returns consisting in forcing him to relinquish a small amount\r\nof transportation and forage at the mouth of the pass just beyond\r\nCowan, a station on the line of the Nashville and Chattanooga\r\nrailroad.\r\n\r\nAt Cowan, Colonel Watkins, of the Sixth Kentucky Cavalry, reported to\r\nme with twelve hundred mounted men.  Having heard during the night\r\nthat the enemy had halted on the mountain near the University--an\r\neducational establishment on the summit--I directed Watkins to make a\r\nreconnoissance and find out the value of the information.  He learned\r\nthat Wharton's brigade of cavalry was halted at the University to\r\ncover a moderately large force of the enemy's infantry which had not\r\nyet got down the mountain on the other side, so I pushed Watkins out\r\nagain on the 5th, supporting him by a brigade of infantry, which I\r\naccompanied myself.  We were too late, however, for when we arrived\r\nat the top of the mountain Wharton had disappeared, and though\r\nWatkins pursued to Bridgeport, he was able to do nothing more, and on\r\nhis return reported that the last of the enemy had crossed the\r\nTennessee River and burned the railroad bridge.\r\n\r\nNothing further could now be done, so I instructed Watkins to rejoin\r\nthe division at Cowan, and being greatly fatigued by the hard\r\ncampaigning of the previous ten days, I concluded to go back to my\r\ncamp in a more comfortable way than on the back of my tired horse.\r\nIn his retreat the enemy had not disturbed the railway track at all,\r\nand as we had captured a hand-car at Cowan, I thought I would have it\r\nbrought up to the station near the University to carry me down the\r\nmountain to my camp, and, desiring company, I persuasively invited\r\nColonel Frank T. Sherman to ride with me.  I sent for the car by a\r\ncourier, and for a long time patiently awaited its arrival, in fact,\r\nuntil all the returning troops had passed us, but still it did not\r\ncome.  Thinking it somewhat risky to remain at the station without\r\nprotection, Sherman and myself started our horses to Cowan by our\r\norderlies, and set out on foot to meet the car, trudging along down\r\nthe track in momentary expectation of falling in with our private\r\nconveyance.  We had not gone very far before night overtook us, and\r\nwe then began to realize the dangers surrounding us, for there we\r\nwere alone and helpless, tramping on in the darkness over an unknown\r\nrailroad track in the enemy's country, liable on the one hand to go\r\ntumbling through some bridge or trestle, and on the other, to\r\npossible capture or death at the hands of the guerrillas then\r\ninfesting these mountains.  Just after dark we came to a little cabin\r\nnear the track, where we made bold to ask for water, notwithstanding\r\nthe fact that to disclose ourselves to the inmates might lead to\r\nfatal consequences.  The water was kindly given, but the owner and\r\nhis family were very much exercised lest some misfortune might befall\r\nus near their house, so they encouraged us to move on with a frankness\r\ninspired by fear of future trouble to themselves.\r\n\r\nAt every turn we eagerly hoped to meet the hand-car, but it never\r\ncame, and we jolted on from tie to tie for eleven weary miles,\r\nreaching Cowan after midnight, exhausted and sore in every muscle\r\nfrom frequent falls on the rough, unballasted road-bed.  Inquiry.\r\ndeveloped that the car had been well manned, and started to us as\r\nordered, and nobody could account for its non-arrival.  Further\r\ninvestigation next day showed, however, that when it reached the foot\r\nof the mountain, where the railroad formed a junction, the improvised\r\ncrew, in the belief no doubt that the University was on the main line\r\ninstead of near the branch to Tracy City, followed the main stem\r\nuntil it carried them clear across the range down the Crow Creek\r\nValley, where the party was captured.\r\n\r\nI had reason to remember for many a day this foolish adventure, for\r\nmy sore bones and bruised muscles, caused me physical suffering until\r\nI left the Army of the Cumberland the next spring; but I had still\r\nmore reason to feel for my captured men, and on this account I have\r\nnever ceased to regret that I so thoughtlessly undertook to rejoin my\r\ntroops by rail, instead of sticking to my faithful horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nORDERED TO OCCUPY BRIDGEPORT--A SPY--THE BATTLE OF CHICKAMAUGA\r\n--GENERAL THOMAS--TREATED TO COFFEE--RESULTS OF THE BATTLE.\r\n\r\nThe Tullahoma campaign was practically closed by the disappearance of\r\nthe enemy from the country north of the Tennessee River.  Middle\r\nTennessee was once more in the possession of the National troops, and\r\nRosecrans though strongly urged from Washington to continue on,\r\nresisted the pressure until he could repair the Nashville and\r\nChattanooga railroad, which was of vital importance in supplying his\r\narmy from its secondary base at Nashville.  As he desired to hold\r\nthis road to where it crossed the Tennessee, it was necessary to push\r\na force beyond the mountains, and after a few days of rest at Cowan\r\nmy division was ordered to take station at Stevenson, Alabama, the\r\njunction of the Memphis and Charleston road with the Nashville and\r\nChattanooga, with instructions to occupy Bridgeport also.\r\n\r\nThe enemy had meanwhile concentrated most of his forces at\r\nChattanooga for the twofold purpose of holding this gateway of the\r\nCumberland Mountains, and to assume a defensive attitude which would\r\nenable him to take advantage of such circumstances as might arise in\r\nthe development of the offensive campaign he knew we must make.  The\r\npeculiar topography of the country was much to his advantage, and\r\nwhile we had a broad river and numerous spurs and ridges of the\r\nCumberland Mountains to cross at a long distance from our base, he\r\nwas backed up on his depots of supply, and connected by interior\r\nlines of railway with the different armies of the Confederacy, so\r\nthat he could be speedily reinforced.\r\n\r\nBridgeport was to be ultimately a sub-depot for storing subsistence\r\nsupplies, and one of the points at which our army would cross the\r\nTennessee, so I occupied it on July 29 with two brigades, retaining\r\none at Stevenson, however, to protect that railway junction from\r\nraids by way of Caperton's ferry.  By the 29th of August a\r\nconsiderable quantity of supplies had been accumulated, and then\r\nbegan a general movement of our troops for crossing the river.  As\r\nthere were not with the army enough pontoons to complete the two\r\nbridges required, I was expected to build one of them of trestles;\r\nand a battalion of the First Michigan Engineers under Colonel Innis\r\nwas sent me to help construct the bridge.  Early on the 31st I sent\r\ninto the neighboring woods about fifteen hundred men with axes and\r\nteams, and by nightfall they had delivered on the riverbank fifteen\r\nhundred logs suitable for a trestle bridge.  Flooring had been\r\nshipped to me in advance by rail, but the quantity was insufficient,\r\nand the lack had to be supplied by utilizing planking and\r\nweather-boarding taken from barns and houses in the surrounding\r\ncountry.  The next day Innis's engineers, with the assistance of the\r\ndetail that had felled the timber, cut and half-notched the logs, and\r\nput the bridge across; spanning the main channel, which was swimming\r\ndeep, with four or five pontoons that had been sent me for this\r\npurpose. On the 2d and 3d of September my division crossed on the\r\nbridge in safety, though we were delayed somewhat because of its\r\ngiving way once where the pontoons joined the trestles.  We were\r\nfollowed by a few detachments from other commands, and by nearly\r\nall the transportation of McCook's corps.\r\n\r\nAfter getting to the south side of the Tennessee River I was ordered\r\nto Valley Head, where McCook's corps was to concentrate.  On the 4th\r\nof September I ascended Sand Mountain, but had got only half way\r\nacross the plateau, on top, when night came, the march having been a\r\nmost toilsome one.  The next day we descended to the base, and\r\nencamped near Trenton.  On the 10th I arrived at Valley Head, and\r\nclimbing Lookout Mountain, encamped on the plateau at Indian Falls.\r\nThe following day I went down into Broomtown Valley to Alpine.\r\nThe march of McCook's corps from Valley Head to Alpine was in\r\npursuance of orders directing it to advance on Summerville, the\r\npossession of which place would further threaten the enemy's\r\ncommunications, it being assumed that Bragg was in full retreat\r\nsouth, as he had abandoned Chattanooga on the 8th.  This assumption\r\nsoon proved erroneous, however, and as we, while in Broomtown Valley,\r\ncould not communicate directly with Thomas's corps, the scattered\r\ncondition of the army began to alarm us all, and McCook abandoned the\r\nadvance to Summerville, ordering back to the summit of Lookout\r\nMountain such of the corps trains as had got down into Broomtown\r\nValley.\r\n\r\nBut before this I had grown uneasy in regard to the disjointed\r\nsituation of our army, and, to inform myself of what was going on,\r\ndetermined to send a spy into the enemy's lines.  In passing Valley\r\nHead on the 10th my scout Card, who had been on the lookout for some\r\none capable to undertake the task, brought me a Union man with whom\r\nhe was acquainted, who lived on Sand Mountain, and had been much\r\npersecuted by guerrillas on account of his loyal sentiments.  He knew\r\nthe country well, and as his loyalty was vouched for I asked him to\r\ngo into the enemy's camp, which I believed to be near Lafayette, and,\r\nbring me such information as he could gather.  He said such a journey\r\nwould be at the risk of his life, and that at best he could not\r\nexpect to remain in that section of country if he undertook it, but\r\nthat he would run all the chances if I would enable him to emigrate\r\nto the West at the end c f the \"job,\" which I could do by purchasing\r\nthe small \"bunch\" of stock he owned on the mountain.  To this I\r\nreadily assented, and he started on the delicate undertaking.  He\r\npenetrated the enemy's lines with little difficulty, but while\r\nprosecuting his search for information was suspected, and at once\r\narrested and placed under guard.  From this critical situation he\r\nescaped; however, making his way through the enemy's picket-line in\r\nthe darkness by crawling on his belly and deceiving the sentinels by\r\nimitating the grunts of the half-wild, sand-colored hogs with which\r\nthe country abounded.  He succeeded in reaching Rosecrans's\r\nheadquarters finally, and there gave the definite information that\r\nBragg intended to fight, and that he expected to be reinforced by\r\nLongstreet.\r\n\r\nBy this time it was clear that Bragg had abandoned Chattanooga with\r\nthe sole design of striking us in detail as we followed in pursuit;\r\nand to prevent his achieving this purpose orders came at 12 o'clock,\r\nmidnight, for McCook to draw in toward Chattanooga.  This could be\r\ndone only by recrossing Lookout Mountain, the enemy's army at\r\nLafayette now interposing between us and Thomas's corps.  The\r\nretrograde march began at once.  I moved back over the mountain on\r\nthe 13th and 14th to Stevens's Mills, and on the 15th and 16th\r\nrecrossed through Stevens's Gap, in the Lookout range, and encamped\r\nat its base in McLamore's cove.  The march was made with all possible\r\ncelerity, for the situation was critical and demanded every exertion.\r\nThe ascent and descent of the mountains was extremely exhausting, the\r\nsteep grades often rendering it necessary to drag up and let down by\r\nhand both the transportation and artillery.  But at last we were in\r\nconjunction with the main army, and my division breathed easier.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th I remained in line of battle all day and night in front\r\nof McLamore's cove, the enemy making slight demonstrations against me\r\nfrom the direction of Lafayette.  The main body of the army having\r\nbodily moved to the left meanwhile, I followed it on the 18th,\r\nencamping at Pond Spring.  On the 19th I resumed the march to the\r\nleft and went into line of battle at Crawfish Springs to cover our\r\nright and rear.  Immediately after forming this line, I again became\r\nisolated by the general movement to the left, and in consequence was\r\ndirected to advance and hold the ford of Chickamauga Creek at Lee and\r\nGordon's Mills, thus coming into close communication with the balance\r\nof our forces.  I moved into this position rapidly, being compelled,\r\nthough, first to drive back the enemy's cavalry skirmishers, who,\r\nhaving crossed to the west side of the creek, annoyed the right flank\r\nof my column a good deal while en route.\r\n\r\nUpon arrival at Lee and Gordon's Mills I found the ford over\r\nChickamauga Creek temporarily uncovered, through the hurried movement\r\nof Wood to the assistance of Davis's division.  The enemy was already\r\npresent in small force, with the evident intention of taking\r\npermanent possession, but my troops at once actively engaged him and\r\nrecovered the ford with some slight losses.  Scarcely had this been\r\ndone when I was directed to assist Crittenden.  Leaving Lytle's\r\nbrigade at the ford, I proceeded with Bradley's and Laiboldt's to\r\nhelp Crittenden, whose main line was formed to the east of the\r\nChattanooga and Lafayette road, its right trending toward a point on\r\nChickamauga Creek about a mile and a half north of Lee and Gordon's\r\nMills.  By the time I had joined Crittenden with my two brigades,\r\nDavis had been worsted in an attack Rosecrans had ordered him to make\r\non the left of that portion of the enemy's line which was located\r\nalong the west bank of the Chickamauga, the repulse being so severe\r\nthat one of Davis's batteries had to be abandoned.  Bradley's brigade\r\narrived on the ground first and was hastily formed and thrown into\r\nthe fight, which up to this moment had been very doubtful, fortune\r\ninclining first to one side, then to the other.  Bradley's brigade\r\nwent in with steadiness, and charging across an open corn-field that\r\nlay in front of the Lafayette road, recovered Davis's guns and forced\r\nthe enemy to retire.  Meanwhile Laiboldt's brigade had come on the\r\nscene, and forming it on Bradley's right, I found myself at the end\r\nof the contest holding the ground which was Davis's original\r\nposition.  It was an ugly fight and my loss was heavy, including\r\nBradley wounded.  The temporary success was cheering, and when\r\nLytle's brigade joined me a little later I suggested to Crittenden\r\nthat we attack, but investigation showed that his troops, having been\r\nengaged all day, were not in condition, so the suggestion could not\r\nbe carried out.\r\n\r\nThe events of the day had indicated that Bragg's main object was to\r\nturn Rosecrans's left; it was therefore still deemed necessary that\r\nthe army should continue its flank movement to the left, so orders\r\ncame to draw my troops in toward the widow Glenn's house.  By\r\nstrengthening the skirmish line and shifting my brigades in\r\nsuccession from right to left until the point designated was reached,\r\nI was able to effect the withdrawal without much difficulty, calling\r\nin my skirmish line after the main force had retired.\r\n\r\nMy command having settled down for the night in this new line I rode\r\nto army headquarters, to learn if possible the expectations for the\r\nmorrow and hear the result of the battle in General Thomas's front.\r\nNearly all the superior officers of the army were at headquarters,\r\nand it struck me that much depression prevailed, notwithstanding the\r\nfact that the enemy's attempts during the day to turn our left flank\r\nand also envelop our right had been unsuccessful.  It was now\r\npositively known, through prisoners and otherwise, that Bragg had\r\nbeen reinforced to such an extent as to make him materially outnumber\r\nus, consequently there was much apprehension for the future.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of protecting our left was most apparent, and the next\r\nday the drifting in that direction was to be continued.  This\r\nmovement in the presence of the enemy, who at all points was actively\r\nseeking an opportunity to penetrate our line and interpose a column\r\nbetween its right and left, was most dangerous.  But the necessity\r\nfor shifting the army to the left was obvious, hence only the method\r\nby which it was undertaken is open to question.  The move was made by\r\nthe flank in the face of an exultant foe superior in numbers, and was\r\na violation of a simple and fundamental military principle.  Under\r\nsuch circumstances columns naturally stretch out into attenuated\r\nlines, organizations become separated, and intervals occur, all of\r\nwhich we experienced; and had the orders for the movement been\r\nconstrued properly I doubt if it could have been executed without\r\nserious danger.  Necessity knows no law, however, and when all the\r\ncircumstances of this battle are fully considered it is possible that\r\njustification may be found for the manoeuvres by which the army was\r\nthus drifted to the left.  We were in a bad strait unquestionably,\r\nand under such conditions possibly the exception had to be applied\r\nrather than the rule.\r\n\r\nAt daylight on the morning of the 20th a dense fog obscured\r\neverything; consequently both armies were passive so far as fighting\r\nwas concerned.  Rosecrans took advantage of the inaction to rearrange\r\nhis right, and I was pulled back closer to the widow Glenn's house to\r\na strong position, where I threw together some rails and logs as\r\nbarricades, but I was disconnected from the troops on my left by a\r\nconsiderable interval.  Here I awaited the approach of the enemy, but\r\nhe did not disturb me, although about 9 o'clock in the forenoon he\r\nhad opened on our extreme left with musketry fire and a heavy\r\ncannonade.  Two hours later it was discovered by McCook that the\r\ninterval between the main army and me was widening, and he ordered me\r\nto send Laiboldt's brigade to occupy a portion of the front that had\r\nbeen covered by Negley's division.  Before getting this brigade into\r\nplace, however, two small brigades of Davis's division occupied the\r\nground, and I directed Laiboldt to form in column of regiments on the\r\ncrest of a low ridge in rear of Carlin's brigade, so as to prevent\r\nDavis's right flank from being turned.  The enemy was now feeling\r\nDavis strongly, and I was about sending for Lytle's and Bradley's\r\nbrigades when I received an order to move these rapidly to the\r\nextreme left of the army to the assistance of General Thomas.  I rode\r\nhastily back toward their position, but in the meanwhile, they had\r\nbeen notified by direct orders from McCook, and were moving out at a\r\ndouble-quick toward the Lafayette road.  By this time the enemy had\r\nassaulted Davis furiously in front and flank, and driven him from his\r\nline, and as the confused mass came back, McCook ordered Laiboldt to\r\ncharge by deploying to the front.  This he did through Davis's broken\r\nranks, but failed to check the enemy's heavy lines, and finally\r\nLaiboldt's brigade broke also and fell to the rear.  My remaining\r\ntroops, headed by Lytle, were now passing along the rear of the\r\nground where this disaster took place--in column on the road--en\r\nroute to Thomas, and as the hundreds of fugitives rushed back, McCook\r\ndirected me to throw in Lytle's and Bradley's brigades.  This was\r\nhastily done, they being formed to the front under a terrible fire.\r\nScarcely were they aligned when the same horde of Confederates that\r\nhad overwhelmed Davis and Laiboldt poured in upon them a deadly fire\r\nand shivered the two brigades to pieces.  We succeeded in rallying\r\nthem, however, and by a counter attack regained the ridge that\r\nLaiboldt had been driven from, where we captured the colors of the\r\nTwenty-fourth Alabama.  We could not hold the ridge, though, and my\r\ntroops were driven back with heavy loss, including General Lytle\r\nkilled, past the widow Glenn's house, and till I managed to establish\r\nthem in line of battle on a range of low hills behind the Dry Valley\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nDuring these occurrences General Rosecrans passed down the road\r\nbehind my line, and sent word that he wished to see me, but affairs\r\nwere too critical to admit of my going to him at once, and he rode on\r\nto Chattanooga.  It is to be regretted that he did not wait till I\r\ncould join him, for the delay would have permitted him to see that\r\nmatters were not in quite such bad shape as he supposed; still, there\r\nis no disguising the fact that at this juncture his army was badly\r\ncrippled.\r\n\r\nShortly after my division had rallied on the low hills already\r\ndescribed, I discovered that the enemy, instead of attacking me in\r\nfront, was wedging in between my division and the balance of the\r\narmy; in short, endeavoring to cut me off from Chattanooga.  This\r\nnecessitated another retrograde movement, which brought me back to\r\nthe southern face of Missionary Ridge, where I was joined by Carlin's\r\nbrigade of Davis's division.  Still thinking I could join General\r\nThomas, I rode some distance to the left of my line to look for a way\r\nout, but found that the enemy had intervened so far as to isolate me\r\neffectually.  I then determined to march directly to Rossville, and\r\nfrom there effect a junction with Thomas by the Lafayette road.  I\r\nreached Rossville about o'clock in the afternoon, bringing with me\r\neight guns, forty-six caissons, and a long ammunition train, the\r\nlatter having been found in a state of confusion behind the widow\r\nGlenn's when I was being driven back behind the Dry Valley road.\r\n\r\nThe head of my column passed through Rossville, appearing upon\r\nThomas's left about 6 o'clock in the evening, penetrated without any\r\nopposition the right of the enemy's line, and captured several of his\r\nfield-hospitals.  As soon as I got on the field I informed Thomas of\r\nthe presence of my command, and asked for orders.  He replied that\r\nhis lines were disorganized, and that it would be futile to attack;\r\nthat all I could do was to hold on, and aid in covering his\r\nwithdrawal to Rossville.\r\n\r\nI accompanied him back to Rossville, and when we reached the skirt of\r\nthe little hamlet General Thomas halted and we dismounted.  Going\r\ninto one of the angles of a worm fence near by I took a rail from the\r\ntop and put it through the lower rails at a proper height from the\r\nground to make a seat, and General Thomas and I sat down while, my\r\ntroops were moving by.  The General appeared very much exhausted,\r\nseemed to forget what he had stopped for, and said little or nothing\r\nof the incidents of the day.  This was the second occasion on which I\r\nhad met him in the midst of misfortune, for during the fight in the\r\ncedars at Stone River, when our prospects were most disheartening, we\r\nheld a brief conversation respecting the line he was then taking up\r\nfor the purpose of helping me.  At other times, in periods of\r\ninactivity, I saw but little of him.  He impressed me, now as he did\r\nin the cedars, his quiet, unobtrusive: demeanor communicating a\r\ngloomy rather than a hopeful view of the situation.  This apparent\r\ndepression was due no doubt to the severe trial through which he had\r\ngone in the last forty-eight hours, which, strain had exhausted him\r\nvery much both physically and mentally.  His success in maintaining\r\nhis ground was undoubtedly largely influenced by the fact that\r\ntwo-thirds of the National forces had been sent to his succor, but his\r\nfirm purpose to save the army was the mainstay on which all relied\r\nafter Rosecrans left the field.  As the command was getting pretty\r\nwell past, I rose to go in order to put my troops into camp.  This\r\naroused the General, when, remarking that he had a little flask of\r\nbrandy in his saddle-holster, he added that he had just stopped for\r\nthe purpose of offering me a drink, as he knew I must be very tired.\r\nHe requested one of his staff-officers to get the flask, and after\r\ntaking a sip himself, passed it to me.  Refreshed by the brandy, I\r\nmounted and rode off to supervise the encamping of my division, by no\r\nmeans an easy task considering the darkness, and the confusion that\r\nexisted among the troops that had preceded us into Rossville.\r\n\r\nThis done, I lay down at the foot of a tree, with my saddle for a\r\npillow, and saddle-blanket for a cover.  Some soldiers near me having\r\nbuilt a fire, were making coffee, and I guess I must have been\r\nlooking on wistfully, for in a little while they brought me a\r\ntin-cupful of the coffee and a small piece of hard bread, which I\r\nrelished keenly, it being the first food that had passed my lips\r\nsince the night before.  I was very tired, very hungry, and much\r\ndiscouraged by what had taken place since morning.  I had been\r\nobliged to fight my command under the most disadvantageous\r\ncircumstances, disconnected, without supports, without even\r\nopportunity to form in line of battle, and at one time contending\r\nagainst four divisions of the enemy.  In this battle of Chickamauga,\r\nout of an effective strength Of 4,000 bayonets, I had lost 1,517\r\nofficers and men, including two brigade commanders.  This was not\r\nsatisfactory indeed, it was most depressing--and then there was much\r\nconfusion prevailing around Rossville; and, this condition of things\r\ndoubtless increasing my gloomy reflections, it did not seem to me\r\nthat the outlook for the next day was at all auspicious, unless the\r\nenemy was slow to improve his present advantage.  Exhaustion soon\r\nquieted all forebodings, though, and I fell into a sound sleep, from\r\nwhich I was not aroused till daylight.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 21st the enemy failed to advance, and his\r\ninaction gave us the opportunity for getting the broken and\r\ndisorganized army into shape.  It took a large part of the day to\r\naccomplish this, and the chances of complete victory would have been\r\ngreatly in Bragg's favor if he could have attacked us vigorously at\r\nthis time.  But he had been badly hurt in the two days' conflict, and\r\nhis inactivity on the 21st showed that he too had to go through the\r\nprocess of reorganization.  Indeed, his crippled condition began to\r\nshow itself the preceding evening, and I have always thought that,\r\nhad General Thomas held on and attacked the Confederate right and\r\nrear from where I made the junction with him on the Lafayette road,\r\nthe field of Chickamauga would have been relinquished to us; but it\r\nwas fated to be otherwise.\r\n\r\nRosecrans, McCook, and Crittenden passed out of the battle when they\r\nwent back to Chattanooga, and their absence was discouraging to all\r\naware of it.  Doubtless this had much to do with Thomas's final\r\nwithdrawal, thus leaving the field to the enemy, though at an immense\r\ncost in killed and wounded.  The night of the 21st the army moved\r\nback from Rossville, and my division, as the rearguard of the\r\nTwentieth Corps, got within our lines at Chattanooga about 8 o'clock\r\nthe morning of the 22d.  Our unmolested retirement from Rossville\r\nlent additional force to the belief that the enemy had been badly\r\ninjured, and further impressed me with the conviction that we might\r\nhave held on.  Indeed, the battle of Chickamauga was somewhat like\r\nthat of Stone River, victory resting with the side that had the grit\r\nto defer longest its relinquishment of the field.\r\n\r\nThe manoeuvres by which Rosecrans had carried his army over the\r\nCumberland Mountains, crossed the Tennessee River, and possessed\r\nhimself of Chattanooga, merit the highest commendation up to the\r\nabandonment of this town by Bragg on the 8th of September; but I have\r\nalways fancied that that evacuation made Rosecrans over-confident,\r\nand led him to think that he could force Bragg south as far as Rome.\r\nAfter the Union army passed the river and Chattanooga fell into our\r\nhands; we still kept pressing the enemy's communications, and the\r\nconfiguration of the country necessitated more or less isolation of\r\nthe different corps.  McCook's corps of three divisions had crossed\r\ntwo difficult ridges--Sand and Lookout mountains--to Alpine in\r\nBroomtown Valley with intentions against Summerville.  Thomas's corps\r\nhad marched by the way of Stevens's Gap toward Lafayette, which he\r\nexpected to occupy.  Crittenden had passed through Chattanooga, at\r\nfirst directing his march an Ringgold.  Thus the corps of the army\r\nwere not in conjunction, and between McCook and Thomas there\r\nintervened a positive and aggressive obstacle in the shape of Bragg's\r\narmy concentrating and awaiting reinforcement at Lafayette.  Under\r\nthese circumstances Bragg could have taken the different corps in\r\ndetail, and it is strange that he did not, even before receiving his\r\nreinforcements, turn on McCook in Broomtown Valley and destroy him.\r\n\r\nIntelligence that Bragg would give battle began to come to us from\r\nvarious sources as early as the 10th of September, and on the 11th\r\nMcCook found that he could not communicate with Thomas by the direct\r\nroad through Broomtown Valley; but we did not begin closing in toward\r\nChattanooga till the 13th, and even then the Twentieth Corps had\r\nbefore it the certainty of many delays that must necessarily result\r\nfrom the circuitous and difficult mountain roads which we would be\r\nobliged to follow.  Had the different corps, beginning with McCook's,\r\nbeen drawn in toward Chattanooga between the 8th and 12th of\r\nSeptember, the objective point of the campaign would have remained in\r\nour hands without the battle of Chickamauga, but, as has been seen,\r\nthis was not done.  McCook was almost constantly on the march day and\r\nnight between the 13th and the 19th, ascending and descending\r\nmountains, his men worried and wearied, so that when they appeared on\r\nthe battle-field, their fatigued condition operated greatly against\r\ntheir efficiency.  This delay in concentration was also the original\r\ncause of the continuous shifting toward our left to the support of\r\nThomas, by which manoeuvre Rosecrans endeavored to protect his\r\ncommunications with Chattanooga, and out of which grew the intervals\r\nthat offered such tempting opportunities to Bragg.  In addition to\r\nall this, much transpired on the field of battle tending to bring\r\nabout disaster.  There did not seem to be any well-defined plan of\r\naction in the fighting; and this led to much independence of judgment\r\nin construing orders among some of the subordinate generals.  It also\r\ngave rise to much license in issuing orders: too many people were\r\ngiving important directions, affecting the whole army, without\r\nauthority from its head.  In view, therefore, of all the errors that\r\nwere committed from the time Chattanooga fell into our hands after\r\nour first crossing the Tennessee, it was fortunate that the Union\r\ndefeat was not more complete, that it left in the enemy's possession\r\nnot much more than the barren results arising from the simple holding\r\nof the ground on which the engagement was fought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nAT CHATTANOOGA--THE ENEMY FORTIFIES LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN AND MISSIONARY\r\nRIDGE--REORGANIZING THE ARMY--REMOVAL OF GENERAL ROSECRANS\r\n--PUNISHMENT OF DESERTERS--GRANT AT CHATTANOOGA--THE FIGHT ON LOOKOUT\r\nMOUNTAIN--A BRAVE COLOR-BEARER--BATTLE OF MISSIONARY RIDGE.\r\n\r\nBy 9 o'clock on the morning of September 22 my command took up a\r\nposition within the heavy line of intrenchments at Chattanooga, the\r\ngreater part of which defenses had been thrown up since the army\r\ncommenced arriving there the day before.  The enemy, having now\r\nsomewhat recovered from the shock of the recent battle, followed\r\ncarefully, and soon invested us close into our lines with a parallel\r\nsystem of rifle-pits.  He also began at once to erect permanent lines\r\nof earthworks on Missionary Ridge and to establish himself strongly\r\non Lookout Mountain.  He then sent Wheeler's cavalry north of the\r\nTennessee, and, aided greatly by the configuration of the ground,\r\nheld us in a state of partial siege, which serious rains might\r\nconvert into a complete investment.  The occupation of Lookout\r\nMountain broke our direct communication with Bridgeport--our\r\nsub-depot--and forced us to bring supplies by way of the Sequatchie\r\nValley and Waldron's Ridge of the Cumberland Mountains, over a road\r\nmost difficult even in the summer season, but now liable to be\r\nrendered impassable by autumn rains.  The distance to Bridgeport by\r\nthis circuitous route was sixty miles, and the numerous passes,\r\ncoves, and small valleys through which the road ran offered tempting\r\nopportunities, for the destruction of trains, and the enemy was not\r\nslow to take advantage of them.  Indeed, the situation was not\r\npromising, and General Rosecrans himself, in communicating with the\r\nPresident the day succeeding the battle of Chickamauga, expressed\r\ndoubts of his ability to hold the gateway of the Cumberland\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\nThe position taken up by my troops inside the lines of Chattanooga\r\nwas near the old iron-works, under the shadow of Lookout Mountain.\r\nHere we were exposed to a continual fire from the enemy's batteries\r\nfor many days, but as the men were well covered by secure though\r\nsimple intrenchments, but little damage was done.  My own\r\nheadquarters were established on the grounds of Mr. William\r\nCrutchfield, a resident of the place, whose devotion to the Union\r\ncause knew no bounds, and who rendered me--and, in fact, at one time\r\nor another, nearly every general officer in the Army of the\r\nCumberland--invaluable service in the way of information about the\r\nConfederate army.  My headquarters camp frequently received shots\r\nfrom the point of Lookout Mountain also, but fortunately no\r\ncasualties resulted from this plunging fire, though, I am free to\r\nconfess, at first our nerves were often upset by the whirring of\r\ntwenty-pounder shells dropped inconsiderately into our camp at\r\nuntimely hours of the night.\r\n\r\nIn a few days rain began to fall, and the mountain roads by which our\r\nsupplies came were fast growing impracticable.  Each succeeding train\r\nof wagons took longer to make the trip from Bridgeport, and the draft\r\nmules were dying by the hundreds.  The artillery horses would soon go\r\ntoo, and there was every prospect that later the troops would starve\r\nunless something could be done.  Luckily for my division, a company\r\nof the Second Kentucky Cavalry had attached itself to my\r\nheadquarters, and, though there without authority, had been left\r\nundisturbed in view of a coming reorganization of the army incidental\r\nto the removal of McCook and Crittenden from the command of their\r\nrespective corps, a measure that had been determined upon immediately\r\nafter the battle of Chickamauga.  Desiring to remain with me, Captain\r\nLowell H. Thickstun, commanding this company, was ready for any duty\r\nI might find, for him, so I ordered him into the Sequatchie Valley\r\nfor the purpose of collecting supplies for my troops, and sent my\r\nscout, Card along to guide him to the best locations.  The company\r\nhid itself away in a deep cove in the upper end of the valley, and by\r\nkeeping very quiet and paying for everything it took from the people,\r\nin a few days was enabled to send me large quantities of corn for my\r\nanimals and food for the officers and men, which greatly supplemented\r\nthe scanty supplies we were getting from the sub-depot at Bridgeport.\r\nIn this way I carried men and animals through our beleaguerment in\r\npretty fair condition, and of the turkeys, chickens, ducks, and eggs\r\nsent in for the messes of my officers we often had enough to divide\r\nliberally among those at different headquarters.  Wheeler's cavalry\r\nnever discovered my detached company, yet the chances of its capture\r\nwere not small, sometimes giving much uneasiness; still, I concluded\r\nit was better to run all risks than to let the horses die of\r\nstarvation in Chattanooga.  Later, after the battle of Missionary\r\nRidge, when I started to Knoxville, the company joined me in\r\nexcellent shape, bringing with it an abundance of food, including a\r\nsmall herd of beef cattle.\r\n\r\nThe whole time my line remained near the iron-mills the shelling from\r\nLookout was kept up, the screeching shots inquisitively asking in\r\ntheir well-known way, \"Where are you? Where are you?\" but it is\r\nstrange to see how readily, soldiers can become accustomed to the\r\nsound of dangerous missiles under circumstances of familiarity, and\r\nthis case was no exception to the rule.  Few casualties occurred, and\r\nsoon contempt took the place of nervousness, and as we could not\r\nreply in kind on account of the elevation required for our guns, the\r\nmen responded by jeers and imprecations whenever a shell fell into\r\ntheir camp.\r\n\r\nMeantime, orders having been issued for the organization of the army,\r\nadditional troops were attached to my command, and it became the\r\nSecond Division of the Fourth Army Corps, to which Major-General\r\nGordon Granger was assigned as commander.  This necessitated a change\r\nof position of the division, and I moved to ground behind our works,\r\nwith my right resting on Fort Negley and my left extending well over\r\ntoward Fort Wood, my front being parallel to Missionary Ridge.  My\r\ndivision was now composed of twenty-five regiments, classified into\r\nbrigades and demi-brigades, the former commanded by Brigadier-General\r\nG. D. Wagner, Colonel C. G. Harker, and Colonel F. T. Sherman; the\r\nlatter, by Colonels Laiboldt, Miller, Wood, Walworth, and Opdyke.\r\nThe demi-brigade was an awkward invention of Granger's; but at this\r\ntime it was necessitated--perhaps by the depleted condition of our\r\nregiments, which compelled the massing of a great number of\r\nregimental organizations into a division to give it weight and force.\r\n\r\nOn October 16, 1863, General Grant had been assigned to the command\r\nof the \"Military Division of the Mississippi,\" a geographical area\r\nwhich embraced the Departments of the Ohio, the Cumberland, and the\r\nTennessee, thus effecting a consolidation of divided commands which\r\nmight have been introduced most profitably at an earlier date.  The\r\nsame order that assigned General Grant relieved General Rosecrans,\r\nand placed General Thomas in command of the Army of the Cumberland.\r\nAt the time of the reception of the order, Rosecrans was busy with\r\npreparations for a movement to open the direct road to Bridgeport\r\n--having received in the interval, since we came back to Chattanooga,\r\nconsiderable reinforcement by the arrival in his department of the\r\nEleventh and Twelfth corps, under General Hooker, from the Army of\r\nthe Potomac.  With this force Rosecrans had already strengthened\r\ncertain important points on the railroad between Nashville and\r\nStevenson, and given orders to Hooker to concentrate at Bridgeport\r\nsuch portions of his command as were available, and to hold them in\r\nreadiness to advance toward Chattanooga.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of October, after turning the command over to Thomas,\r\nGeneral Rosecrans quietly slipped away from the army.  He submitted\r\nuncomplainingly to his removal, and modestly left us without fuss or\r\ndemonstration; ever maintaining, though, that the battle of\r\nChickamauga was in effect a victory, as it had ensured us, he said,\r\nthe retention of Chattanooga.  When his departure became known\r\ndeep and almost universal regret was expressed, for he was\r\nenthusiastically esteemed and loved by the Army of the Cumberland,\r\nfrom the day he assumed command of it until he left it,\r\nnotwithstanding the censure poured upon him after the battle of\r\nChickamauga.\r\n\r\nThe new position to which my division had been moved, in consequence\r\nof the reorganization, required little additional labor to strengthen\r\nit, and the routine of fatigue duty and drills was continued as\r\nbefore, its monotony occasionally broken by the excitement of an\r\nexpected attack, or by amusements of various kinds that were\r\ncalculated to keep the men in good spirits.  Toward this result much\r\nwas contributed by Mr. James E. Murdock, the actor, who came down\r\nfrom the North to recover the body of his son, killed at Chickamauga,\r\nand was quartered with me for the greater part of the time he was\r\nobliged to await the successful conclusion of his sad mission.  He\r\nspent days, and even weeks, going about through the division giving\r\nrecitations before the camp-fires, and in improvised chapels, which\r\nthe men had constructed from refuse lumber and canvas.  Suiting his\r\nselections to the occasion, he never failed to excite intense\r\ninterest in the breasts of all present, and when circumstances\r\nfinally separated him from us, all felt that a debt of gratitude was\r\ndue him that could never be paid.  The pleasure he gave, and the\r\nconfident feeling that was now arising from expected reinforcements,\r\nwas darkened, however, by one sad incident.  Three men of my division\r\nhad deserted their colors at the beginning of the siege and made\r\ntheir way north.  They were soon arrested, and were brought back to\r\nstand trial for the worst offense that can be committed by a soldier,\r\nconvicted of the crime, and ordered to be shot.  To make the example\r\neffective I paraded the whole division for the execution, and on the\r\n13th of November, in the presence of their former comrades, the\r\nculprits were sent, in accordance with the terms of their sentence,\r\nto render their account to the Almighty.  It was the saddest\r\nspectacle I ever witnessed, but there could be no evasion, no\r\nmitigation of the full letter of the law; its timely enforcement was\r\nbut justice to the brave spirits who had yet to fight the rebellion\r\nto the end.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant arrived at Chattanooga on October 23, and began at once\r\nto carry out the plans that had been formed for opening the shorter\r\nor river road to Bridgeport.  This object was successfully\r\naccomplished by the moving of Hooker's command to Rankin's and\r\nBrown's ferries in concert with a force from the Army of the\r\nCumberland which was directed on the same points, so by the 27th of\r\nOctober direct communication with our depots was established.  The\r\nfour weeks which followed this cheering result were busy with the\r\nwork of refitting and preparing for offensive operations as soon as\r\nGeneral Sherman should reach us with his troops from West Tennessee.\r\nDuring this period of activity the enemy committed the serious fault\r\nof detaching Longstreet's corps--sending it to aid in the siege of\r\nKnoxville in East Tennessee--an error which has no justification\r\nwhatever, unless it be based on the presumption that it was\r\nabsolutely necessary that Longstreet should ultimately rejoin Lee's\r\narmy in Virginia by way of Knoxville and Lynchburg, with a chance of\r\npicking up Burnside en route.  Thus depleted, Bragg still held\r\nMissionary Ridge in strong force, but that part of his line which\r\nextended across the intervening valley to the northerly point of.\r\nLookout Mountain was much attenuated.\r\n\r\nBy the 18th of November General Grant had issued instructions\r\ncovering his intended operations.  They contemplated that Sherman's\r\ncolumn, which was arriving by the north bank of the Tennessee, should\r\ncross the river on a pontoon bridge just below the mouth of\r\nChickamauga Creek and carry the northern extremity of Missionary\r\nRidge as far as the railroad tunnel; that the Army of the Cumberland\r\n--the centre--should co-operate with Sherman; and that Hooker with a\r\nmixed command should continue to hold Lookout Valley and operate on\r\nour extreme right as circumstances might warrant.  Sherman crossed on\r\nthe 24th to perform his alloted part of the programme, but in the\r\nmeantime Grant becoming impressed with the idea that Bragg was\r\nendeavoring to get away, ordered Thomas to make a strong\r\ndemonstration in his front, to determine the truth or falsity of the\r\ninformation that had been received.  This task fell to the Fourth\r\nCorps, and at 12 o'clock on the 23d I was notified that Wood's\r\ndivision would make a reconnoissance to an elevated point in its\r\nfront called Orchard Knob, and that I was to support it with my\r\ndivision and prevent Wood's right flank from being turned by an\r\nadvance of the enemy on Moore's road or from the direction of\r\nRossville.  For this duty I marched my division out of the works\r\nabout 2 p.m., and took up a position on Bushy Knob.  Shortly after we\r\nreached this point Wood's division passed my left flank on its\r\nreconnoissance, and my command, moving in support of it, drove in the\r\nenemy's picket-line.  Wood's took possession of Orchard Knob easily,\r\nand mine was halted on a low ridge to the right of the Knob, where I\r\nwas directed by General Thomas to cover my front by a strong line of\r\nrifle-pits, and to put in position two batteries of the Fourth\r\nregular artillery that had joined me from the Eleventh Corps.  After\r\ndark Wood began to feel uneasy about his right flank, for a gap\r\nexisted between it and my left, so I moved in closer to him, taking\r\nup a line where I remained inactive till the 25th, but suffering some\r\ninconvenience from the enemy's shells.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th General Sherman made an attack for the purpose of\r\ncarrying the north end of Missionary Ridge.  His success was not\r\ncomplete, although at the time it was reported throughout the army to\r\nbe so.  It had the effect of disconcerting Bragg, however, and caused\r\nhim to strengthen his right by withdrawing troops from his left,\r\nwhich circumstance led Hooker to advance on the northerly face of\r\nLookout Mountain.  At first, with good glasses, we could plainly see\r\nHooker's troops driving the Confederates up the face of the mountain.\r\nAll were soon lost to view in the dense timber, but emerged again on\r\nthe open ground, across which the Confederates retreated at a lively\r\npace, followed by the pursuing line, which was led by a color-bearer,\r\nwho, far in advance, was bravely waving on his comrades.  The\r\ngallantry of this man elicited much enthusiasm among us all, but as\r\nhe was a considerable distance ahead of his comrades I expected to\r\nsee his rashness punished at any moment by death or capture.  He\r\nfinally got quite near the retreating Confederates, when suddenly\r\nthey made a dash at him, but he was fully alive to such a move, and\r\nran back, apparently uninjured, to his friends.  About this time a\r\nsmall squad of men reached the top of Lookout and planted the Stars\r\nand Stripes on its very crest.  Just then a cloud settled down on the\r\nmountain, and a heavy bank of fog obscured its whole face.\r\n\r\nAfter the view was lost the sharp rattle of musketry continued some\r\ntime, but practically the fight had been already won by Hooker's men,\r\nthe enemy only holding on with a rear-guard to assure his retreat\r\nacross Chattanooga Valley to Missionary Ridge.  Later we heard very\r\nheavy cannonading, and fearing that Hooker was in trouble I sent a\r\nstaff-officer to find out whether he needed assistance, which I\r\nthought could be given by a demonstration toward Rossville.  The\r\nofficer soon returned with the report that Hooker was all right, that\r\nthe cannonading was only a part of a little rear-guard fight, two\r\nsections of artillery making all the noise, the reverberations from\r\npoint to point in the adjacent mountains echoing and reechoing till\r\nit seemed that at least fifty guns were engaged.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 25th of November Bragg's entire army was\r\nholding only the line of Missionary Ridge, and our troops, being now\r\npractically connected from Sherman to Hooker, confronted it with the\r\nArmy of the Cumberland in the centre--bowed out along the front of\r\nWood's division and mine.  Early in the day Sherman, with great\r\ndetermination and persistence, made an attempt to carry the high\r\nground near the tunnel, first gaining and then losing advantage, but\r\nhis attack was not crowned with the success anticipated.  Meanwhile\r\nHooker and Palmer were swinging across Chattanooga Valley, using me\r\nas a pivot for the purpose of crossing Missionary Ridge in the\r\nneighborhood of Rossville.  In the early part of the day I had driven\r\nin the Confederate pickets in my front, so as to prolong my line of\r\nbattle on that of Wood, the necessity of continuing to refuse my\r\nright having been obviated by the capture of Lookout Mountain and the\r\nadvance of Palmer.\r\n\r\nAbout 2 o'clock orders came to carry the line at the foot of the\r\nridge, attacking at a signal of six guns.  I had few changes or new\r\ndispositions to make.  Wagner's brigade, which was next to Wood's\r\ndivision, was formed in double lines, and Harker's brigade took the\r\nsame formation on Wagner's right.  Colonel F. T. Sherman's brigade\r\ncame on Harker's right, formed in a column of attack, with a front of\r\nthree regiments, he having nine.  My whole front was covered with a\r\nheavy line of skirmishers.  These dispositions made, my right rested\r\na little distance south of Moore's road, my left joined Wood over\r\ntoward Orchard Knob, while my centre was opposite Thurman's house\r\n--the headquarters of General Bragg--on Missionary Ridge.  A small\r\nstream of water ran parallel to my front, as far as which the ground\r\nwas covered by a thin patch of timber, and beyond the edge of the\r\ntimber was an open plain to the foot of Missionary Ridge, varying in\r\nwidth from four to nine hundred yards.  At the foot of the ridge was\r\nthe enemy's first line of rifle-pits; at a point midway up its face,\r\nanother line, incomplete; and on the crest was a third line, in which\r\nBragg had massed his artillery.\r\n\r\nThe enemy saw we were making dispositions for an attack, and in plain\r\nview of my whole division he prepared himself for resistance,\r\nmarching regiments from his left flank with flying colors; and\r\nfilling up the spaces not already occupied in his intrenchments.\r\nSeeing the enemy thus strengthening himself, it was plain that we\r\nwould have to act quickly if we expected to accomplish much, and I\r\nalready began to doubt the feasibility of our remaining in the first\r\nline of rifle-pits when we should have carried them.  I discussed the\r\norder with Wagner, Harker, and Sherman, and they were similarly\r\nimpressed, so while anxiously awaiting the signal I sent Captain\r\nRansom of my staff to Granger, who was at Fort Wood, to ascertain if\r\nwe were to carry the first line or the ridge beyond.  Shortly after\r\nRansom started the signal guns were fired, and I told my brigade\r\ncommanders to go for the ridge.\r\n\r\nPlacing myself in front of Harker's brigade, between the line of\r\nbattle and the skirmishers, accompanied by only an orderly so as not\r\nto attract the enemy's fire, we moved out.  Under a terrible storm of\r\nshot and shell the line pressed forward steadily through the timber,\r\nand as it emerged on the plain took the double-quick and with fixed\r\nbayonets rushed at the enemy's first line.  Not a shot was fired from\r\nour line of battle, and as it gained on my skirmishers they melted\r\ninto and became one with it, and all three of my brigades went over\r\nthe rifle-pits simultaneously.  They then lay down on the face of the\r\nridge, for a breathing-spell and for protection' from the terrible\r\nfire, of canister and musketry pouring over us from the guns on the\r\ncrest.  At the rifle-pits there had been little use for the bayonet,\r\nfor most of the Confederate troops, disconcerted by the sudden rush,\r\nlay close in the ditch and surrendered, though some few fled up the\r\nslope to the next line.  The prisoners were directed to move out to\r\nour rear, and as their intrenchments had now come under fire from the\r\ncrest, they went with alacrity, and without guard or escort, toward\r\nChattanooga.\r\n\r\nAfter a short pause to get breath the ascent of the ridge began, and\r\nI rode, into the ditch of the intrenchments to drive out a few\r\nskulkers who were hiding there.  Just at this time I was joined by\r\nCaptain Ransom, who, having returned from Granger, told me that we\r\nwere to carry only the line at the base, and that in coming back,\r\nwhen he struck the left of the division, knowing this interpretation\r\nof the order, he in his capacity as an aide-de-camp had directed\r\nWagner, who was up on the face of the ridge, to return, and that in\r\nconsequence Wagner was recalling his men to the base.  I could not\r\nbear to order the recall of troops now so gallantly climbing the hill\r\nstep by step, and believing we could take it, I immediately rode to\r\nWagner's brigade and directed it to resume the attack.  In the\r\nmeantime Harker's and F. T. Sherman's troops were approaching the\r\npartial line of works midway of the ridge, and as I returned to the\r\ncentre of their rear, they were being led by many stands of\r\nregimental colors.  There seemed to be a rivalry as to which color\r\nshould be farthest to the front; first one would go forward a few\r\nfeet, then another would come up to it, the color-bearers vying with\r\none another as to who should be foremost, until finally every\r\nstandard was planted on the intermediate works.  The enemy's fire\r\nfrom the crest during the ascent was terrific in the noise made, but\r\nas it was plunging, it over-shot and had little effect on those above\r\nthe second line of pits, but was very uncomfortable for those below,\r\nso I deemed it advisable to seek another place, and Wagner's brigade\r\nhaving reassembled and again pressed up the ridge, I rode up the face\r\nto join my troops.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the men saw me, they surged forward and went over the\r\nworks on the crest.  The parapet of the intrenchment was too high for\r\nmy horse to jump, so, riding a short distance to the left, I entered\r\nthrough a low place in the line.  A few Confederates were found\r\ninside, but they turned the butts of their muskets toward me in token\r\nof surrender, for our men were now passing beyond them on both their\r\nflanks.\r\n\r\nThe right and right centre of my division gained the summit first,\r\nthey being partially sheltered by a depression in the face of the\r\nridge, the Confederates in their immediate front fleeing down the\r\nsouthern face.  When I crossed the rifle-pits on the top the\r\nConfederates were still holding fast at Bragg's headquarters, and a\r\nbattery located there opened fire along the crest; making things most\r\nuncomfortably hot.  Seeing the danger to which I was exposed, for I\r\nwas mounted, Colonel Joseph Conrad, of the Fifteenth Missouri, ran up\r\nand begged me to dismount.  I accepted his excellent advice, and it\r\nprobably saved my life; but poor Conrad was punished for his\r\nsolicitude by being seriously wounded in the thigh at the moment he\r\nwas thus contributing to my safety.\r\n\r\nWildly cheering, the men advanced along the ridge toward Bragg's\r\nheadquarters, and soon drove the Confederates from this last\r\nposition, capturing a number of prisoners, among them Breckenridge's\r\nand Bates's adjutant-generals, and the battery that had made such\r\nstout resistance on the crest-two guns which were named \"Lady\r\nBreckenridge\" and \"Lady Buckner\" General Bragg himself having barely\r\ntime to escape before his headquarters were taken.\r\n\r\nMy whole division had now reached the summit, and Wagner and Harker\r\n--the latter slightly wounded--joined me as I was standing in the\r\nbattery just secured.  The enemy was rapidly retiring, and though\r\nmany of his troops, with disorganized wagon-trains and several pieces\r\nof artillery, could be distinctly seen in much confusion about half a\r\nmile distant in the valley below, yet he was covering them with a\r\npretty well organized line that continued to give us a desultory\r\nfire.  Seeing this, I at once directed Wagner and Harker to take up\r\nthe pursuit along Moore's road, which led to Chickamauga Station\r\n--Bragg's depot of supply--and as they progressed, I pushed Sherman's\r\nbrigade along the road behind them.  Wagner and Harker soon overtook\r\nthe rearguard, and a slight skirmish caused it to break, permitting\r\nnine guns and a large number of wagons which were endeavoring to get\r\naway in the stampede to fall into our hands.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile and a half beyond Missionary Ridge, Moore's road passed\r\nover a second ridge or high range of hills, and here the enemy had\r\ndetermined to make a stand for that purpose, posting eight pieces of\r\nartillery with such supporting force as he could rally.  He was\r\nimmediately attacked by Harker and Wagner, but the position was\r\nstrong, the ridge being rugged and difficult of ascent, and after the\r\nfirst onset our men recoiled.  A staff-officer from Colonel Wood's\r\ndemi-brigade informing me at this juncture that that command was too\r\nweak to carry the position in its front, I ordered the Fifteenth\r\nIndiana and the Twenty-Sixth Ohio to advance to Wood's aid, and then\r\nhastening to the front I found his men clinging to the face of the\r\nridge, contending stubbornly with the rear-guard of the enemy.\r\nDirecting Harker to put Opdyke's demi-brigade in on the right, I\r\ninformed Wagner that it was necessary to flank the enemy by carrying\r\nthe high bluff on our left where the ridge terminated, that I had\r\ndesignated the Twenty-Sixth Ohio and Fifteenth Indiana for the work,\r\nand that I wished him to join them.\r\n\r\nIt was now dusk, but the two regiments engaged in the flanking\r\nmovement pushed on to gain the bluff.  Just as they reached the crest\r\nof the ridge the moon rose from behind, enlarged by the refraction of\r\nthe atmosphere, and as the attacking column passed along the summit\r\nit crossed the moon's disk and disclosed to us below a most\r\ninteresting panorama, every figure nearly being thrown out in full\r\nrelief.  The enemy, now outflanked on left and right, abandoned his\r\nground, leaving us two pieces of artillery and a number of wagons.\r\nAfter this ridge was captured I found that no other troops than mine\r\nwere pursuing the enemy, so I called a halt lest I might become too\r\nmuch isolated.  Having previously studied the topography of the\r\ncountry thoroughly, I knew that if I pressed on my line of march\r\nwould carry me back to Chickamauga station, where we would be in rear\r\nof the Confederates that had been fighting General Sherman, and that\r\nthere was a possibility of capturing them by such action; but I did\r\nnot feel warranted in marching there alone, so I rode back to\r\nMissionary Ridge to ask for more troops, and upon arriving there I\r\nfound Granger in command, General Thomas having gone back to\r\nChattanooga.\r\n\r\nGranger was at Braggy's late headquarters in bed.  I informed him of\r\nmy situation and implored him to follow me up with the Army of the\r\nCumberland, but he declined, saying that he thought we had done well\r\nenough.  I still insisting, he told me finally to push on to the\r\ncrossing of Chickamauga Creek, and if I, encountered the enemy he\r\nwould order troops to my support.  I returned to my division about\r\n12 o'clock at night, got it under way, and reached the crossing,\r\nabout half a mile from the station, at 2 o'clock on the morning of\r\nthe 26th, and there found the bridge destroyed, but that the creek\r\nwas fordable.  I did not encounter the enemy in any force, but feared\r\nto go farther without assistance.  This I thought I might bring up by\r\npracticing a little deception, so I caused two regiments to simulate\r\nan engagement by opening fire, hoping that this would alarm Granger\r\nand oblige him to respond with troops, but my scheme failed.  General\r\nGranger afterward told me that he had heard the volleys, but\r\nsuspected their purpose, knowing that they were not occasioned by a\r\nfight, since they were too regular in their delivery.\r\n\r\nI was much disappointed that my pursuit had not been supported, for I\r\nfelt that great results were in store for us should the enemy be\r\nvigorously followed.  Had the troops under Granger's command been\r\npushed out with mine when Missionary Ridge was gained, we could have\r\nreached Chickamauga Station by 12 o'clock the night of the 25th; or\r\nhad they been sent even later, when I called for them, we could have\r\ngot there by daylight and worked incalculable danger to the\r\nConfederates, for the force that had confronted Sherman did not pass\r\nChickamauga Station in their retreat till after daylight on the\r\nmorning of the 26th.\r\n\r\nMy course in following so close was dictated by a thorough knowledge\r\nof the topography of the country and a familiarity with its roads,\r\nbypaths, and farm-houses, gained with the assistance of Mr.\r\nCrutchfield; and sure my column was heading in the right direction,\r\nthough night had fallen I thought that an active pursuit would almost\r\ncertainly complete the destruction of Bragg's army.  When General\r\nGrant came by my bivouac at the crossing of Chickamauga Creek on the\r\n26th, he realized what might have been accomplished had the\r\nsuccessful assault on Missionary Ridge been supplemented by vigorous\r\nefforts on the part of some high officers, who were more interested\r\nin gleaning that portion of the battle-field over which my command\r\nhad passed than in destroying a panic-stricken enemy.\r\n\r\nAlthough it cannot be said that the result of the two days'\r\noperations was reached by the methods which General Grant had\r\nindicated in his instructions preceding the battle, yet the general\r\noutcome was unquestionably due to his genius, for the manoeuvring of\r\nSherman's and Hooker's commands created the opportunity for Thomas's\r\ncorps of the Army of the Cumberland to carry the ridge at the centre.\r\nIn directing Sherman to attack the north end of the ridge, Grant\r\ndisconcerted Bragg--who was thus made to fear the loss of his depot\r\nof supplies at Chickamauga Station--and compelled him to resist\r\nstoutly; and stout resistance to Sherman meant the withdrawal of the\r\nConfederates from Lookout Mountain.  While this attack was in process\r\nof execution advantage was taken of it by Hooker in a well-planned\r\nand well-fought battle, but to my mind an unnecessary one, for our\r\npossession of Lookout was the inevitable result that must follow from\r\nSherman's threatening attitude.  The assault on Missionary Ridge by\r\nGranger's and Palmer's corps was not premeditated by Grant, he\r\ndirecting only the line at its base to be carried, but when this fell\r\ninto our hands the situation demanded our getting the one at the top\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nI took into the action an effective force of 6,000, and lost 123\r\nofficers and 1,181 men killed and wounded.  These casualties speak\r\nlouder than words of the character of the fight, and plainly tell\r\nwhere the enemy struggled most stubbornly for these figures comprise\r\none-third the casualties of the entire body of Union troops\r\n--Sherman's and all included.  My division captured 1,762 prisoners\r\nand, in all, seventeen pieces of artillery.  Six of these guns I\r\nturned over with caissons complete; eleven were hauled off the field\r\nand appropriated by an officer of high rank--General Hazen.  I have\r\nno disposition to renew the controversy which grew out of this\r\nmatter.  At the time the occurrence took place I made the charge in a\r\nplain official report, which was accepted as correct by the corps and\r\narmy commanders, from General Granger up to General Grant.  General\r\nHazen took no notice of this report then, though well aware of its\r\nexistence.  Nearly a quarter of a century later, however, he\r\nendeavored to justify his retention of the guns by trying to show\r\nthat his brigade was the first to reach the crest of Missionary\r\nRidge, and that he was therefore entitled to them.  This claim of\r\nbeing the first to mount the ridge is made by other brigades than\r\nHazen's, with equal if not greater force, so the absurdity of his\r\ndeduction is apparent:\r\n\r\nNOTE: In a book published by General Hazen in 1885, he endeavored to\r\nshow, by a number of letters from subordinate officers of his\r\ncommand, written at his solicitation from fifteen to twenty years\r\nafter the occurrence, that his brigade was the first to mount\r\nMissionary Ridge, and that it was entitled to possess these guns.\r\nThe doubtful character of testimony dimmed by the lapse of many years\r\nhas long been conceded, and I am content to let the controversy stand\r\nthe test of history, based on the conclusions of General Grant, as he\r\ndrew them from official reports made when the circumstances were\r\nfresh in the minds of all.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant says: \"To Sheridan's prompt movement, the Army of the\r\nCumberland and the nation are indebted for the bulk of the capture of\r\nprisoners, artillery, and small-arms that day.  Except for his prompt\r\npursuit, so much in this way would not have been accomplished.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Thomas says: \"We captured all their cannon and ammunition\r\nbefore they could be removed or destroyed.  After halting a few\r\nmoments to reorganize the troops, who had become somewhat scattered\r\nin the assault of the hill, General Sheridan pushed forward in\r\npursuit, and drove those in his front who had escaped capture across\r\nChickamauga Creek.\"\r\n\r\nREPORT OF COLONEL FRANCIS T. SHERMAN, COMMANDING FIRST BRIGADE:\r\n\"When within ten yards of the crest, our men seemed to be thrown\r\nforward as if by some powerful engine, and the old flag was planted\r\nfirmly and surely on the last line of works of the enemy, followed by\r\nthe men, taking one battery of artillery.\"\r\n\r\nREPORT OF COLONEL MICHAEL GOODING, TWENTY-SECOND INDIANA:\r\n....\"I pushed men up to the second line of works as fast as possible;\r\non and on, clear to the top, and over the ridge they went, to the\r\nhollow beyond, killing and wounding numbers of the enemy as we\r\nadvanced, and leaving the rebel battery in our rear.  We captured\r\ngreat numbers of prisoners, and sent them to the rear without guards,\r\nas we deemed the pursuit of the enemy of greater importance....\r\n\"I cannot give too much praise to Captain Powers, Company \"H,\"\r\nLieutenant Smith, Company \"K,\" Lieutenant Gooding, Company \"A,\" and\r\nSecond Lieutenant Moser, Company \"G,\" for their assistance, and for\r\nthe gallant manner in which they encouraged their men up the side of\r\nthe mountain, and charging the enemy's works right up to the muzzles\r\nof their guns.\"\r\n\r\nREPORT OF COLONEL JASON MARSH, SEVENTY-FOURTH ILLINOIS:\r\n....\"The first on the enemy's works, and almost simultaneously, were\r\nLieutenant Clement, Company \"A,\" Captain Stegner, Company \"I,\"\r\nCaptain Bacon, Company \"G,\" and Captain Leffingwell, with some of\r\ntheir men.  The enemy was still in considerable force behind their\r\nworks; but, for some unaccountable reason, they either fled or\r\nsurrendered instantly upon the first few of our men reaching them\r\n--not even trying to defend their battery, which was immediately\r\ncaptured by Captain Stegner.\"\r\n\r\nREPORT OF LIEUTENANT-COLONEL PORTER C. OLSON, THIRTY-SIXTH ILLINOIS:\r\n....\"In connection with other regiments of this brigade, we assisted\r\nin capturing several pieces of artillery, a number of caissons, and a\r\ngreat quantity of small-arms.\"\r\n\r\nREPORT OF COLONEL JOHN Q. LANE:\r\n....\"At the house known as Bragg's headquarters, the enemy were\r\ndriven from three guns, which fell into our hands.\"\r\n\r\nREPORT OF BRIGADIER-GENERAL G. D. WAGNER, SECOND BRIGADE:\r\n....\"I ordered the command to storm the ridge, bringing up the\r\nFifteenth Indiana and Ninety-seventh Ohio, which had not yet been\r\nengaged, although suffering from the enemy's artillery.  The result\r\nis a matter of history, as we gained the ridge, capturing artillery,\r\nprisoners, and small-arms; to what amount, however, I do not know, as\r\nwe pushed on after the enemy as soon as I had re-formed the command.\r\n....Captain Tinney, with his usual gallantry, dashed up the line with\r\nthe first troops, and with the aid of an orderly (George Dusenbury,\r\nFifteenth Indiana), turned the loaded gun of the enemy on his\r\nretreating ranks.\"\r\n\r\nREPORT OF CAPTAIN BENJAMIN F.

MOORE, FIFTY-EIGHTH INDIANA:\r\n....\"In passing to the front from Missionary Ridge, we saw several\r\npieces of artillery which had been abandoned by the enemy, though I\r\ndid not leave any one in charge of them.\"\r\n\r\nREPORT OF MAJOR C, M.

He returned and\r\nreported them to be four ten-pound Parrotts and two brass Napoleons;\r\nalso that it would require a number of men to place them in position.\r\nI ordered him to report the same to General Wagner, and ask\r\npermission, but before receiving a reply was ordered by you to move\r\nforward my regiment on the left of the Fifty-Eighth Indiana\r\nVolunteers.\"\r\n\r\nREPORT OF COLONEL CHARLES G. HARKER, THIRD BRIGADE:\r\n....\"My right and Colonel Sherman's left interlocked, so to speak, as\r\nwe approached the summit, and it was near this point that I saw the\r\nfirst part of my line gain the crest.  This was done by a few brave\r\nmen of my own and Colonel Sherman's command driving the enemy from\r\nhis intrenchments.  The gap thus opened, our men rushed rapidly in,\r\nand the enemy, loth to give up their position, still remained, firing\r\nat my command toward the left, and the battery in front of the house\r\nknown as General Bragg's headquarters was still firing at the troops,\r\nand was captured by our men while the gunners were still at their\r\nposts....\r\n....\"We captured and sent to division and corps headquarters 503\r\nprisoners and a large number of small-arms.  In regard to the number\r\nof pieces of artillery, it will probably be difficult to reconcile\r\nthe reports of my regimental commanders with the reports of other\r\nregiments and brigades who fought so nobly with my own command, and\r\nwho alike are entitled to share the honors and glories of the day.\r\nMore anxious to follow the enemy than to appropriate trophies already\r\nsecured, we pushed to the front, while the place we occupied on\r\nascending the hill was soon occupied by other troops, who, I have\r\nlearned, claim the artillery as having fallen into their own hands.\r\nIt must therefore remain with the division and corps commanders, who\r\nknew the relative position of each brigade and division, to accord to\r\neach the trophies to which they are due.\r\n....\"From my personal observation I can claim a battery of six guns\r\ncaptured by a portion of my brigade.\"\r\n\r\nREPORT OF COLONEL EMERSON OPDYKE, FIRST DEMI-BRIGADE:\r\n....\"My command captured Bragg's headquarters, house, and the six\r\nguns which were near there; one of these I ordered turned upon the\r\nenemy, which was done with effect.\"\r\n\r\nREPORT OF COLONEL H. C. DUNLAP, THIRD KENTUCKY:\r\n....\"The point at which the centre of my regiment reached the crest\r\nwas at the stable to the left of the house said to be Bragg's\r\nheadquarters, and immediately in front of the road which leads down\r\nthe southern slope of the ridge.

BULLITT, SIXTY-FIFTH OHIO:\r\n....\"The position in which my regiment found itself was immediately\r\nin front of a battery, which belched forth a stream of canister upon\r\nus with terrible rapidity.  In addition to this, the enemy, whenever\r\ndriven from other points, rallied around this battery, and defended\r\nit with desperation.  It cost a struggle to take it; but we finally\r\nsucceeded, and the colors of the Sixty-fifth Ohio were the first\r\nplanted upon the yet smoking guns.  Captain Smith, of my regiment,\r\nwas placed in charge of the captured battery, which consisted of 5\r\nguns, 3 caissons, and 17 horses.\"\r\n\r\nREPORT OF CAPTAIN E. P. BATES, ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIFTH OHIO:\r\n....\"Perceiving that the ridge across which my regiment extended was\r\ncommanded to the very crest by a battery in front, also by those to\r\nright and left, I directed the men to pass up the gorges on either\r\nside.  About forty men, with Captain Parks and Lieutenant Stinger,\r\npassed to the left, the balance to the right, and boldly charged on,\r\ntill, foremost with those of other regiments, they stood on the\r\nstrongest point of the enemy's works, masters alike of his guns and\r\nposition....  Captain Parks reports his skirmish-line to have charged\r\nupon and captured one gun, that otherwise would have been hauled\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\nREPORT OF COLONEL ALLEN BUCKNER, SEVENTY-NINTH ILLINOIS:\r\n....\"The right of the regiment rested on the left of the road, where\r\nit crossed the rebel fortification, leading up the hill toward\r\nBragg's headquarters.  We took a right oblique direction through a\r\npeach orchard until arriving at the woods and logs on the side of the\r\nridge, when I ordered the men to commence firing, which they did with\r\ngood effect, and continued it all the way up until the heights were\r\ngained.  At this point the left of the regiment was near the right of\r\nthe house, and I claim that my officers and men captured two large\r\nbrass pieces, literally punching the cannoniers from their guns.\r\nPrivates John Fregan and Jasper Patterson, from Company \"A,\" rushed\r\ndown the hill, captured one caisson, with a cannonier and six horses,\r\nand brought them back.\"\r\n\r\nREPORT OF COLONEL J. R. MILES, TWENTY-SEVENTH ILLINOIS:\r\n....\"The regiment, without faltering, finally, at about 4.30 P.M.,\r\ngained the enemy's works in conjunction with a party of the\r\nThirty-sixth Illinois, who were immediately on our right.  The\r\nregiment, or a portion of it, proceeded to the left, down the ridge,\r\nfor nearly or quite a quarter of a mile capturing three or four pieces\r\nof cannon, driving the gunners from them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nORDERED TO RETURN TO CHATTANOOGA--MARCH TO KNOXVILLE--COLLECTING\r\nSUBSISTENCE STORES--A CLEVER STRATAGEM--A BRIDGE OF WAGONS--LOOKING\r\nOUT FOR THE PERSONAL COMFORT OF THE SOLDIERS-A LEAVE OF ABSENCE\r\n--ORDERED TO WASHINGTON--PARTING WITH SHERIDAN'S DIVISION.\r\n\r\nThe day after the battle of Missionary Ridge I was ordered in the\r\nevening to return to Chattanooga, and from the limited supply of\r\nstores to be had there outfit my command to march to the relief of\r\nKnoxville, where General Burnside was still holding out against the\r\nbesieging forces of General Longstreet.  When we left Murfreesboro'\r\nin the preceding June, the men's knapsacks and extra clothing, as\r\nwell as all our camp equipage, had been left behind, and these\r\narticles had not yet reached us, so we were poorly prepared for a\r\nwinter campaign in the mountains of East Tennessee.  There was but\r\nlittle clothing to be obtained in Chattanooga, and my command\r\nreceived only a few overcoats and a small supply of India-rubber\r\nponchos.  We could get no shoes, although we stood in great need of\r\nthem, for the extra pair with which each man had started out from\r\nMurfreesboro' was now much the worse for wear.  The necessity for\r\nsuccoring Knoxville was urgent, however, so we speedily refitted as\r\nthoroughly as was possible with the limited means at hand.  My\r\ndivision teams were in very fair condition in consequence of the\r\nforage we had procured in the Sequatchie Valley, so I left the train\r\nbehind to bring up clothing when any should arrive in Chattanooga.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, on the 29th of November the Fourth Corps\r\n(Granger's) took up the line of march for Knoxville, my men carrying\r\nin their haversacks four days' rations, depending for a further\r\nsupply of food on a small steamboat loaded with subsistence stores,\r\nwhich was to proceed up the Tennessee River and keep abreast of the\r\ncolumn.\r\n\r\nNot far from Philadelphia, Tennessee, the columns of General\r\nSherman's army, which had kept a greater distance from the river than\r\nGranger's corps, so as to be able to subsist on the country, came in\r\ntoward our right and the whole relieving force was directed on\r\nMarysville, about fifteen miles southwest of Knoxville.  We got to\r\nMarysville December 5, and learned the same day that Longstreet had\r\nshortly before attempted to take Knoxville by a desperate assault,\r\nbut signally failing, had raised the siege and retired toward Bean's\r\nStation on the Rutledge, Rogersville, and Bristol road, leading to\r\nVirginia.  From Marysville General Sherman's troops returned to\r\nChattanooga, while Granger's corps continued on toward Knoxville, to\r\ntake part in the pursuit of Longstreet.\r\n\r\nBurnside's army was deficient in subsistence, though not to the\r\nextent that we had supposed before leaving Chattanooga.  It had eaten\r\nout the country in the immediate vicinity of Knoxville, however;\r\ntherefore my division did not cross the Holstein River, but was\r\nrequired, in order to maintain itself, to proceed to the region of\r\nthe French Broad River.  To this end I moved to Sevierville, and\r\nmaking this village my headquarters, the division was spread out over\r\nthe French Broad country, between Big Pigeon and Little Pigeon\r\nrivers, where we soon had all the mills in operation, grinding out\r\nplenty of flour and meal.  The whole region was rich in provender\r\nof all kinds, and as the people with rare exceptions were\r\nenthusiastically loyal, we in a little while got more than enough\r\nfood for ourselves, and by means of flatboats began sending the\r\nsurplus down the river to the troops at Knoxville.\r\n\r\nThe intense loyalty of this part of Tennessee exceeded that of any\r\nother section I was in during the war.  The people could not do too\r\nmuch to aid the Union cause, and brought us an abundance of\r\neverything needful.  The women were especially loyal, and as many of\r\ntheir sons and husbands, who had been compelled to \"refugee\" on\r\naccount of their loyal sentiments, returned with us, numbers of the\r\nwomen went into ecstasies of joy when this part of the Union army\r\nappeared among them.  So long as we remained in the French Broad\r\nregion, we lived on the fat of the land, but unluckily our stay was\r\nto be of short duration, for Longstreet's activity kept the\r\ndepartment commander in a state of constant alarm.\r\n\r\nSoon after getting the mills well running, and when the shipment of\r\ntheir surplus product down the river by flatboats had begun, I was\r\nordered to move to Knoxville, on account of demonstrations by\r\nLongstreet from the direction of Blain's crossroads.  On arriving at\r\nKnoxville, an inspection of my command, showed that the shoes of many\r\nof the men were entirely worn out, the poor fellows having been\r\nobliged to protect their feet with a sort of moccasin, made from\r\ntheir blankets or from such other material as they could procure.\r\nAbout six hundred of the command were in this condition, plainly not\r\nsuitably shod to withstand the frequent storms of sleet and snow.\r\nThese men I left in Knoxville to await the arrival of my train, which\r\nI now learned was en route from Chattanooga with shoes, overcoats,\r\nand other clothing, and with the rest of the division proceeded to\r\nStrawberry Plains, which we reached the latter part of December.\r\n\r\nMid-winter was now upon us, and the weather in this mountain region\r\nof East Tennessee was very cold, snow often falling to the depth of\r\nseveral inches.  The thin and scanty clothing of the men afforded\r\nlittle protection, and while in bivouac their only shelter was the\r\nponchos with which they had been provided before leaving Chattanooga;\r\nthere was not a tent in the command.  Hence great suffering resulted,\r\nwhich I anxiously hoped would be relieved shortly by the arrival of\r\nmy train with supplies.  In the course of time the wagons reached\r\nKnoxville, but my troops derived little comfort from this fact, for\r\nthe train was stopped by General Foster, who had succeeded Burnside\r\nin command of the department, its contents distributed pro rata to\r\nthe different organizations of the entire army, and I received but a\r\nsmall share.  This was very disappointing, not to say exasperating,\r\nbut I could not complain of unfairness, for every command in the army\r\nwas suffering to the same extent as mine, and yet it did seem that a\r\nlittle forethought and exertion on the part of some of the other\r\nsuperior officers, whose transportation was in tolerable condition,\r\nmight have ameliorated the situation considerably.  I sent the train\r\nback at once for more clothing, and on its return, just before\r\nreaching Knoxville, the quartermaster in charge, Captain Philip\r\nSmith, filled the open spaces in the wagons between the bows and load\r\nwith fodder and hay, and by this clever stratagem passed it through\r\nthe town safe and undisturbed as a forage train.  On Smith's arrival\r\nwe lost no time in issuing the clothing, and when it had passed into\r\nthe hands of the individual soldiers the danger of its appropriation\r\nfor general distribution, like the preceding invoice, was very\r\nremote.\r\n\r\nGeneral Foster had decided by this time to move his troops to\r\nDandridge for the twofold purpose of threatening the enemy's left and\r\nof getting into a locality where we could again gather subsistence\r\nfrom the French Broad region.  Accordingly we began an advance on the\r\n15th of January, the cavalry having preceded us some time before.\r\nThe Twenty-third Corps and Wood's division of the Fourth Corps\r\ncrossed the Holstein River by a bridge that had been constructed at\r\nStrawberry Plains.  My division being higher up the stream, forded\r\nit, the water very deep and bitter cold, being filled with slushy\r\nice.  Marching by way of New Market, I reached Dandridge on the 17th,\r\nand here on my arrival met General Sturgis, then commanding our\r\ncavalry.  He was on the eve of setting out to, \"whip the enemy's\r\ncavalry,\" as he said, and wanted me to go along and see him do it.  I\r\ndeclined, however, for being now the senior officer present, Foster,\r\nParke, and Granger having remained at Knoxville and Strawberry\r\nPlains, their absence left me in command, and it was necessary that I\r\nshould make disposition of the infantry when it arrived.  As there\r\nwere indications of a considerable force of the enemy on the\r\nRussellville road I decided to place the troops in line of battle, so\r\nas to be prepared for any emergency that might arise in the absence\r\nof the senior officers, and I deemed it prudent to supervise\r\npersonally the encamping of the men.  This disposition necessarily\r\nrequired that some of the organizations should occupy very\r\ndisagreeable ground, but I soon got all satisfactorily posted with\r\nthe exception of General Willich, who expressed some discontent at\r\nbeing placed beyond the shelter of the timber, but accepted the\r\nsituation cheerfully when its obvious necessity was pointed out to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nFeeling that all was secure, I returned to my headquarters in the\r\nvillage with the idea that we were safely established in ease of\r\nattack, and that the men would now have a good rest if left\r\nundisturbed; and plenty to eat, but hardly had I reached my own camp\r\nwhen a staff-officer came post-haste from Sturgis with the\r\ninformation that he was being driven back to my lines, despite the\r\nconfident invitation to me (in the morning) to go out and witness the\r\nwhipping which was to be given to the enemy's cavalry.  Riding to the\r\nfront, I readily perceived that the information was correct, and I\r\nhad to send a brigade of infantry out to help Sturgis, thus relieving\r\nhim from a rather serious predicament.  Indeed, the enemy was present\r\nin pretty strong force, both cavalry and infantry, and from his\r\nvicious attack on Sturgis it looked very much as though he intended\r\nto bring on a general engagement.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances I deemed it advisable that the responsible\r\ncommanders of the army should be present, and so informed them.  My\r\ncommunication brought Parke and Granger to the front without delay,\r\nbut Foster could not come, since the hardships of the winter had\r\nreopened an old wound received during the Mexican War, and brought on\r\nmuch suffering.  By the time Parke and Granger arrived, however, the\r\nenemy, who it turned out was only making a strong demonstration to\r\nlearn the object of our movement on Dandridge, seemed satisfied with\r\nthe results of his reconnoissance, and began falling back toward\r\nBull's Gap.  Meanwhile Parke and Granger concluded that Dandridge was\r\nan untenable point, and hence decided to withdraw a part of the army\r\nto Strawberry Plains; and the question of supplies again coming up,\r\nit was determined to send the Fourth Corps to the south side of the\r\nFrench Broad to obtain subsistence, provided we could bridge the\r\nriver so that men could get across the deep and icy stream without\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nI agreed to undertake the construction of a bridge on condition that\r\neach division should send to the ford twenty-five wagons with which\r\nto make it.  This being acceded to, Harker's brigade began the work\r\nnext morning at a favorable point a few miles down the river.  As my\r\nquota of wagons arrived, they were drawn into the stream one after\r\nanother by the wheel team, six men in each wagon, and as they\r\nsuccessively reached the other side of the channel the mules were\r\nunhitched, the pole of each wagon run under the hind axle of the one\r\njust in front, and the tailboards used so as to span the slight space\r\nbetween them.  The plan worked well as long as the material lasted,\r\nbut no other wagons than my twenty-five coming on the ground, the\r\nwork stopped when the bridge was only half constructed.  Informed of\r\nthe delay and its cause, in sheer desperation I finished the bridge\r\nby taking from my own division all the wagons needed to make up the\r\ndeficiency.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon when the work was finished, and I began\r\nputting over one of my brigades; but in the midst of its crossing\r\nword came that Longstreet's army was moving to attack us, which\r\ncaused an abandonment of the foraging project, and orders quickly\r\nfollowed to retire to Strawberry Plains, the retrograde movement to\r\nbegin forthwith.  I sent to headquarters information of the plight I\r\nwas in--baggage and supplies on the bank and wagons in the stream\r\n--begged to know what was to become of them if we were to hurry off at\r\na moment's notice, and suggested that the movement be delayed until I\r\ncould recover my transportation.  Receiving in reply no assurances\r\nthat I should be relieved from my dilemma--and, in fact, nothing\r\nsatisfactory--I determined to take upon myself the responsibility of\r\nremaining on the ground long enough to get my wagons out of the river;\r\nso I sent out a heavy force to watch for the enemy, and with the\r\nremainder of the command went to work to break up the bridge. Before\r\ndaylight next morning I had recovered everything without interference\r\nby Longstreet, who, it was afterward ascertained, was preparing to\r\nmove east toward Lynchburg instead of marching to attack us; the small\r\ndemonstration against Dandridge, being made simply to deceive us as to\r\nhis ultimate object.  I marched to Strawberry Plains unmolested, and\r\nby taking the route over Bay's Mountain, a shorter one than that\r\nfollowed by the main body of our troops, reached the point of\r\nrendezvous as soon as the most of the army, for the road it followed\r\nwas not only longer, but badly cut up by trains that had recently\r\npassed over it.\r\n\r\nShortly after getting into camp, the beef contractor came in and\r\nreported that a detachment of the enemy's cavalry had captured my\r\nherd of beef cattle.  This caused me much chagrin at first, but the\r\ncommissary of my division soon put in an appearance, and assured me\r\nthat the loss would not be very disastrous to us nor of much benefit\r\nto the enemy, since the cattle were so poor and weak that they could\r\nnot be driven off.  A reconnoissance in force verified the\r\nCommissary's statement.  From its inability to travel, the herd,\r\nafter all efforts to carry it off had proved ineffectual, had been\r\nabandoned by its captors.\r\n\r\nAfter the troops from Chattanooga arrived in the vicinity of\r\nKnoxville and General Sherman had returned to Chattanooga, the\r\noperations in East Tennessee constituted a series of blunders,\r\nlasting through the entire winter; a state of affairs doubtless due,\r\nin the main, to the fact that the command of the troops was so\r\nfrequently changed.  Constant shifting of responsibility from one to\r\nanother ensued from the date that General Sherman, after assuring\r\nhimself that Knoxville was safe, devolved the command on Burnside.\r\nIt had already been intimated to Burnside that he was to be relieved,\r\nand in consequence he was inactive and apathetic, confining his\r\noperations to an aimless expedition whose advance extended only as\r\nfar as Blain's crossroads, whence it was soon withdrawn.  Meanwhile\r\nGeneral Foster had superseded Burnside, but physical disabilities\r\nrendered him incapable of remaining in the field, and then the chief\r\nauthority devolved on Parke.  By this time the transmission of power\r\nseemed almost a disease; at any rate it was catching, so, while we\r\nwere en route to Dandridge, Parke transferred the command to Granger.\r\nThe latter next unloaded it on me, and there is no telling what the\r\nfinal outcome would have been had I not entered a protest against a\r\nfurther continuance of the practice, which remonstrance brought\r\nGranger to the front at Dandridge.\r\n\r\nWhile the events just narrated were taking place, General Grant had\r\nmade a visit to Knoxville--about the last of December--and arranged\r\nto open the railroad between there and Chattanooga, with a view to\r\nsupplying the troops in East Tennessee by rail in the future, instead\r\nof through Cumberland Gap by a tedious line of wagon-trains.  In\r\npursuance of his plan the railroad had already been opened to Loudon,\r\nbut here much delay occurred on account of the long time it took to\r\nrebuild the bridge over the Tennessee.  Therefore supplies were still\r\nvery scarce, and as our animals were now dying in numbers from\r\nstarvation, and the men were still on short allowance, it became\r\nnecessary that some of the troops east of Knoxville should get nearer\r\nto their depot, and also be in a position to take part in the coming\r\nGeorgia campaign, or render assistance to General Thomas, should\r\nGeneral Johnston (who had succeeded in command of the Confederate\r\narmy) make any demonstration against Chattanooga.  Hence my division\r\nwas ordered to take station at Loudon, Tennessee, and I must confess\r\nthat we took the road for that point with few regrets, for a general\r\ndisgust prevailed regarding our useless marches during the winter.\r\n\r\nAt this time my faithful scout Card and his younger brother left me,\r\nwith the determination, as I have heretofore related, to avenge their\r\nbrother's death.  No persuasion could induce Card to remain longer,\r\nfor knowing that my division's next operation would be toward\r\nAtlanta, and being ignorant of the country below Dalton, he\r\nrecognized and insisted that his services would then become\r\npractically valueless.\r\n\r\nAt Loudon, where we arrived January 27, supplies were more plentiful,\r\nand as our tents and extra clothing reached us there in a few days,\r\nevery one grew contented and happy.  Here a number of my regiments,\r\nwhose terms of service were about to expire, went through the process\r\nof \"veteranizing,\" and, notwithstanding the trials and hardships of\r\nthe preceding nine months, they re-enlisted almost to a man.\r\n\r\nWhen everything was set in motion toward recuperating and refitting\r\nmy troops, I availed myself of the opportunity during a lull that\r\nthen existed to take a short leave of absence--a privilege I had not\r\nindulged in since entering the service in 1853.  This leave I spent\r\nin the North with much benefit to my physical condition, for I was\r\nmuch run down by fatiguing service, and not a little troubled by\r\nintense pain which I at times still suffered from my experience in\r\nthe unfortunate hand-car incident on the Cumberland Mountains the\r\nprevious July.  I returned from leave the latter part of March,\r\nrejoining my division with the expectation that the campaign in that\r\nsection would begin as early as April.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of March, 1864, General Grant was assigned to the command\r\nof the armies of the United States, as general-in-chief.  He was\r\nalready in Washington, whither he had gone to receive his commission\r\nas lieutenant-general.  Shortly after his arrival there, he commenced\r\nto rearrange the different commands in the army to suit the plans\r\nwhich he intended to enter upon in the spring, and out of this grew a\r\nchange in my career.  Many jealousies and much ill-feeling, the\r\noutgrowth of former campaigns, existed among officers of high grade\r\nin the Army of the Potomac in the winter of 1864, and several general\r\nofficers were to be sent elsewhere in consequence.  Among these,\r\nGeneral Alfred Pleasonton was to be relieved from the command of the\r\ncavalry, General Grant having expressed to the President\r\ndissatisfaction that so little had hitherto been accomplished by that\r\narm of the service, and I was selected as chief of the cavalry corps\r\nof the Army of the Potomac, receiving on the night of the 23d of\r\nMarch from General Thomas at Chattanooga the following telegram:\r\n\r\n\"MARCH 23, 1864.\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL THOMAS, Chattanooga\r\n\r\n\"Lieutenant-General Grant directs that Major-General Sheridan\r\nimmediately repair to Washington and report to the Adjutant-General\r\nof the Army.\r\n\r\n\"H. W. HALLECK,\r\nMajor-General, Chief-of-Staff.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI was not informed of the purpose for which I was to proceed to\r\nWashington, but I conjectured that it meant a severing of my\r\nrelations with the Second Division, Fourth Army Corps.  I at once set\r\nabout obeying the order, and as but little preparation was necessary,\r\nI started for Chattanooga the next day, without taking any formal\r\nleave of the troops I had so long commanded.  I could not do it; the\r\nbond existing between them and me had grown to such depth of\r\nattachment that I feared to trust my emotions in any formal parting\r\nfrom a body of soldiers who, from our mutual devotion, had long\r\nbefore lost their official designation, and by general consent within\r\nand without the command were called \"Sheridan's Division.\"  When I\r\ntook the train at the station the whole command was collected on the\r\nhill-sides around to see me off.  They had assembled spontaneously,\r\nofficers and men, and as the cars moved out for Chattanooga they\r\nwaved me farewell with demonstrations of affection.\r\n\r\nA parting from such friends was indeed to be regretted.  They had\r\nnever given me any trouble, nor done anything that could bring aught\r\nbut honor to themselves.  I had confidence in them, and I believe\r\nthey had in me.  They were ever steady, whether in victory or in\r\nmisfortune, and as I tried always to be with them, to put them into\r\nthe hottest fire if good could be gained, or save them from\r\nunnecessary loss, as occasion required, they amply repaid all my care\r\nand anxiety, courageously and readily meeting all demands in every\r\nemergency that arose.\r\n\r\nIn Kentucky, nearly two years before, my lot had been cast with about\r\nhalf of the twenty-five regiments of infantry that I was just\r\nleaving, the rest joining me after Chickamauga.  It was practically a\r\nnew arm of the service to me, for although I was an infantry officer,\r\nyet the only large command which up to that time I had controlled was\r\ncomposed of cavalry, and most of my experience had been gained in\r\nthis arm of the service.  I had to study hard to be able to master\r\nall the needs of such a force, to feed and clothe it and guard all\r\nits interests.  When undertaking these responsibilities I felt that\r\nif I met them faithfully, recompense would surely come through the\r\nhearty response that soldiers always make to conscientious exertion\r\non the part of their superiors, and not only that more could be\r\ngained in that way than from the use of any species of influence, but\r\nthat the reward would be quicker.  Therefore I always tried to look\r\nafter their comfort personally; selected their camps, and provided\r\nabundantly for their subsistence, and the road they opened for me\r\nshows that my work was not in vain.  I regretted deeply to have to\r\nleave such soldiers, and felt that they were sorry I was going, and\r\neven now I could not, if I would, retain other than the warmest\r\nsentiments of esteem and the tenderest affection for the officers and\r\nmen of \"Sheridan's Division,\" Army of the Cumberland.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Chattanooga I learned from General Thomas the purpose for\r\nwhich I had been ordered to Washington.  I was to be assigned to the\r\ncommand of the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac.  The\r\ninformation staggered me at first, for I knew well the great\r\nresponsibilities of such a position; moreover, I was but slightly\r\nacquainted with military operations in Virginia, and then, too, the\r\nhigher officers of the Army of the Potomac were little known to me,\r\nso at the moment I felt loth to undergo the trials of the new\r\nposition.  Indeed, I knew not a soul in Washington except General\r\nGrant and General Halleck, and them but slightly, and no one in\r\nGeneral Meade's army, from the commanding general down, except a few\r\nofficers in the lower grades, hardly any of whom I had seen since\r\ngraduating at the Military Academy.\r\n\r\nThus it is not much to be wondered at that General Thomas's\r\ncommunication momentarily upset me.  But there was no help for it, so\r\nafter reflecting on the matter a little I concluded to make the best\r\nof the situation.  As in Virginia I should be operating in a field\r\nwith which I was wholly unfamiliar, and among so many who were\r\nstrangers, it seemed to me that it would be advisable to have, as a\r\nchief staff-officer, one who had had service in the East, if an\r\navailable man could be found.  In weighing all these considerations\r\nin my mind, I fixed upon Captain James W. Forsyth, of the Eighteenth\r\nInfantry, then in the regular brigade at Chattanooga--a dear friend\r\nof mine, who had served in the Army of the Potomac, in the Peninsula\r\nand Antietam campaigns.  He at once expressed a desire to accept a\r\nposition on my staff, and having obtained by the next day the\r\nnecessary authority, he and I started for Washington, accompanied by\r\nLieutenant T. W. C. Moore, one of my aides, leaving behind Lieutenant\r\nM. V. Sheridan, my other aide, to forward our horses as soon as they\r\nshould be sent down to Chattanooga from Loudon, after which he was to\r\njoin me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nAT WASHINGTON--MEETING SECRETARY STANTON--INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT\r\nLINCOLN--MADE COMMANDER OF THE CAVALRY CORPS OF THE ARMY OF THE\r\nPOTOMAC--ITS OFFICERS--GENERAL MEADE's METHOD OF USING CAVALRY\r\n--OPENING OF THE CAMPAIGN--SPOTTSYLVANIA C. H.--A DIFFERENCE WITH\r\nGENERAL MEADE--PREPARING TO FIGHT STUART'S CAVALRY.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by Captain Forsyth and Lieutenant Moore, I arrived in\r\nWashington on the morning of April, 4, 1864, and stopped at Willard's\r\nHotel, where, staying temporarily, were many officers of the Army of\r\nthe Potomac en route to their commands from leave at the North.\r\nAmong all these, however, I was an entire stranger, and I cannot now\r\nrecall that I met a single individual whom I had ever before known.\r\n\r\nWith very little delay after reaching my hotel I made my way to\r\nGeneral Halleck's headquarters and reported to that officer, having\r\nlearned in the meantime that General Grant was absent from the city.\r\nGeneral Halleck talked to me for a few minutes, outlining briefly the\r\nnature and duties of my new command, and the general military\r\nsituation in Virginia.  When he had finished all he had to say about\r\nthese matters, he took me to the office of the Secretary of War, to\r\npresent me to Mr. Stanton.  During the ceremony of introduction, I\r\ncould feel that Mr. Stanton was eying me closely and searchingly,\r\nendeavoring to form some estimate of one about whom he knew\r\nabsolutely nothing, and whose career probably had never been called\r\nto his attention until General Grant decided to order me East, after\r\nmy name had been suggested by General Halleck in an interview the two\r\ngenerals had with Mr. Lincoln.  I was rather young in appearance\r\n--looking even under than over thirty-three years--but five feet five\r\ninches in height, and thin almost to emaciation, weighing only one\r\nhundred and fifteen pounds.  If I had ever possessed any\r\nself-assertion in manner or speech, it certainly vanished in the\r\npresence of the imperious Secretary, whose name at the time was the\r\nsynonym of all that was cold and formal.  I never learned what Mr.\r\nStanton's first impressions of me were, and his guarded and rather\r\ncalculating manner gave at this time no intimation that they were\r\neither favorable or unfavorable, but his frequent commendation in\r\nafter years indicated that I gained his goodwill before the close of\r\nthe war, if not when I first came to his notice; and a more intimate\r\nassociation convinced me that the cold and cruel characteristics\r\npopularly ascribed to him were more mythical than real.\r\n\r\nWhen the interview with the Secretary was over, I proceeded with\r\nGeneral Halleck to the White House to pay my respects to the\r\nPresident.  Mr. Lincoln received me very cordially, offering both his\r\nhands, and saying that he hoped I would fulfill the expectations of\r\nGeneral Grant in the new command I was about to undertake, adding\r\nthat thus far the cavalry of the Army of the Potomac had not done all\r\nit might have done, and wound up our short conversation by quoting\r\nthat stale interrogation so prevalent during the early years of the\r\nwar, \"Who ever saw a dead cavalryman?\"  His manner did not impress\r\nme, however, that in asking the question he had meant anything beyond\r\na jest, and I parted from the President convinced that he did not\r\nbelieve all that the query implied.\r\n\r\nAfter taking leave I separated from General Halleck, and on returning\r\nto my hotel found there an order from the War Department assigning me\r\nto the command of the Cavalry Corps, Army of the Potomac.  The next\r\nmorning, April 5, as I took the cars for the headquarters of the Army\r\nof the Potomac, General Grant, who had returned to Washington the\r\nprevious night from a visit to his family, came aboard the train on\r\nhis way to Culpeper Court House, and on the journey down I learned\r\namong other things that he had wisely determined to continue\r\npersonally in the field, associating himself with General Meade's\r\narmy; where he could supervise its movements directly, and at the\r\nsame time escape the annoyances which, should he remain in\r\nWashington, would surely arise from solicitude for the safety of the\r\nCapital while the campaign was in progress.  When we reached Brandy\r\nStation, I left the train and reported to General Meade, who told me\r\nthat the headquarters of the Cavalry Corps were some distance back\r\nfrom the Station, and indicated the general locations of the\r\ndifferent divisions of the corps, also giving me, in the short time I\r\nremained with him, much information regarding their composition.\r\n\r\nI reached the Cavalry Corps headquarters on the evening of April 5,\r\n1864, and the next morning issued orders assuming command.  General\r\nPleasonton had but recently been relieved, and many of his\r\nstaff-officers were still on duty at the headquarters awaiting the\r\narrival of the permanent commander.  I resolved to retain the most of\r\nthese officers on my staff, and although they were all unknown to me\r\nwhen I decided on this course, yet I never had reason to regret it,\r\nnor to question the selections made by my predecessor.\r\n\r\nThe corps consisted of three cavalry divisions and twelve batteries\r\nof horse artillery.  Brigadier-General A. T. A. Torbert was in\r\ncommand of the First Division, which was composed of three brigades;\r\nBrigadier-General D. McM. Gregg, of the Second, consisting of two\r\nbrigades; and Brigadier-General J. H. Wilson was afterward assigned\r\nto command the Third, also comprising two brigades: Captain Robinson,\r\na veteran soldier of the Mexican war, was chief of artillery, and as\r\nsuch had a general supervision of that arm, though the batteries,\r\neither as units or in sections, were assigned to the different\r\ndivisions in campaign.\r\n\r\nEach one of my division commanders was a soldier by profession.\r\nTorbert graduated from the Military Academy in 1855, and was\r\ncommissioned in the infantry, in which arm he saw much service on the\r\nfrontier, in Florida, and on the Utah expedition.  At the beginning\r\nof hostilities in April, 1861, he was made a colonel of New Jersey\r\nvolunteers, and from that position was promoted in the fall of 1862\r\nto be a brigadier-general, thereafter commanding a brigade of\r\ninfantry in the Army of the Potomac till, in the redistribution of\r\ngenerals, after Grant came to the East, he was assigned to the First\r\nCavalry Division.\r\n\r\nGregg graduated in 1855 also, and was appointed to the First\r\nDragoons, with which regiment, up to the breaking out of the war, he\r\nsaw frontier service extending from Fort Union, New Mexico, through\r\nto the Pacific coast, and up into Oregon and Washington Territories,\r\nwhere I knew him slightly.  In the fall of 1861 he became colonel of\r\nthe Eighth Pennsylvania Cavalry, and a year later was made a\r\nbrigadier-general.  He then succeeded to the command of a division of\r\ncavalry, and continued in that position till the close of his\r\nservice, at times temporarily commanding the Cavalry Corps.  He was\r\nthe only division commander I had whose experience had been almost\r\nexclusively derived from the cavalry arm.\r\n\r\nWilson graduated in 1860 in the Topographical Engineers, and was\r\nfirst assigned to duty in Oregon, where he remained till July, 1861.\r\nIn the fall of that year his active service in the war began, and he\r\nrose from one position to another, in the East and West, till, while\r\non General Grant's staff, he was made a brigadier-general in the fall\r\nof 1863 in reward for services performed during the Vicksburg\r\ncampaign and for engineer duty at Chattanooga preceding the battle of\r\nMissionary Ridge.  At my request he was selected to command the Third\r\nDivision.  General Grant thought highly of him, and, expecting much\r\nfrom his active mental and physical ability, readily assented to\r\nassign him in place of General Kilpatrick.  The only other general\r\nofficers in the corps were Brigadier-General Wesley Merritt,\r\nBrigadier-General George A. Custer, and Brigadier-General Henry E.\r\nDavies, each commanding a brigade.\r\n\r\nIn a few days after my arrival at Brandy Station I reviewed my new\r\ncommand, which consisted of about twelve thousand officers and men,\r\nwith the same number of horses in passable trim.  Many of the general\r\nofficers of the army were present at the review, among them Generals\r\nMeade, Hancock, and Sedgwick.  Sedgwick being an old dragoon, came to\r\nrenew his former associations with mounted troops, and to encourage\r\nme, as he jestingly said, because of the traditional prejudices the\r\ncavalrymen were supposed to hold against being commanded by an\r\ninfantry officer.  The corps presented a fine appearance at the\r\nreview, and so far as the health and equipment of the men were\r\nconcerned the showing was good and satisfactory; but the horses were\r\nthin and very much worn down by excessive and, it seemed to me,\r\nunnecessary picket duty, for the cavalry picket-line almost\r\ncompletely encircled the infantry and artillery camps of the army,\r\ncovering a distance, on a continuous line, of nearly sixty miles,\r\nwith hardly a mounted Confederate confronting it at any point.  From\r\nthe very beginning of the war the enemy had shown more wisdom\r\nrespecting his cavalry than we.  Instead of wasting its strength by a\r\npolicy of disintegration he, at an early day, had organized his\r\nmounted force into compact masses, and plainly made it a favorite;\r\nand, as usual, he was now husbanding the strength of his horses by\r\nkeeping them to the rear, so that in the spring he could bring them\r\nout in good condition for the impending campaign.\r\n\r\nBefore and at the review I took in this situation, and determined to\r\nremedy it if possible; so in due time I sought an interview with\r\nGeneral Meade and informed him that, as the effectiveness of my\r\ncommand rested mainly on the strength of its horses, I thought the\r\nduty it was then performing was both burdensome and wasteful.  I also\r\ngave him my idea as to what the cavalry should do, the main purport\r\nof which was that it ought to be kept concentrated to fight the\r\nenemy's cavalry.  Heretofore, the commander of the Cavalry Corps had\r\nbeen, virtually, but an adjunct at army headquarters--a sort of chief\r\nof cavalry--and my proposition seemed to stagger General Meade not a\r\nlittle.  I knew that it would be difficult to overcome the recognized\r\ncustom of using the cavalry for the protection of trains and the\r\nestablishment of cordons around the infantry corps, and so far\r\nsubordinating its operations to the movements of the main army that\r\nin name only was it a corps at all, but still I thought it my duty to\r\ntry.\r\n\r\nAt first General Meade would hardly listen to my proposition, for he\r\nwas filled with the prejudices that, from the beginning of the war,\r\nhad pervaded the army regarding the importance and usefulness of\r\ncavalry, General Scott then predicting that the contest would be\r\nsettled by artillery, and thereafter refusing the services of\r\nregiment after regiment of mounted troops.  General Meade deemed\r\ncavalry fit for little more than guard and picket duty, and wanted to\r\nknow what would protect the transportation trains and artillery\r\nreserve, cover the front of moving infantry columns, and secure his\r\nflanks from intrusion, if my policy were pursued.  I told him that if\r\nhe would let me use the cavalry as I contemplated, he need have\r\nlittle solicitude in these respects, for, with a mass of ten thousand\r\nmounted men, it was my belief that I could make it so lively for the\r\nenemy's cavalry that, so far as attacks from it were concerned, the\r\nflanks and rear of the Army of the Potomac would require little or no\r\ndefense, and claimed, further, that moving columns of infantry should\r\ntake care of their own fronts.  I also told him that it was my object\r\nto defeat the enemy's cavalry in a general combat, if possible, and\r\nby such a result establish a feeling of confidence in my own troops\r\nthat would enable us after awhile to march where we pleased, for the\r\npurpose of breaking General Lee's communications and destroying the\r\nresources from which his army was supplied.\r\n\r\nThe idea as here outlined was contrary to Meade's convictions, for\r\nthough at different times since he commanded the Army of the Potomac\r\nconsiderable bodies of the cavalry had been massed for some special\r\noccasion, yet he had never agreed to the plan as a permanency, and\r\ncould not be bent to it now.  He gave little encouragement,\r\ntherefore, to what I proposed, yet the conversation was immediately\r\nbeneficial in one way, for when I laid before him the true condition\r\nof the cavalry, he promptly relieved it from much of the arduous and\r\nharassing picket service it was performing, thus giving me about two\r\nweeks in which to nurse the horses before the campaign opened.\r\n\r\nThe interview also disclosed the fact that the cavalry commander\r\nshould be, according to General Meade's views, at his headquarters\r\npractically as one of his staff, through whom he would give detailed\r\ndirections as, in his judgment, occasion required.  Meade's ideas and\r\nmine being so widely divergent, disagreements arose between us later\r\nduring the battles of the Wilderness, which lack of concord ended in\r\nsome concessions on his part after the movement toward Spottsylvania\r\nCourt House began, and although I doubt that his convictions were\r\never wholly changed, yet from that date on, in the organization of\r\nthe Army of the Potomac, the cavalry corps became more of a compact\r\nbody, with the same privileges and responsibilities that attached to\r\nthe other corps--conditions that never actually existed before.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of May the Army of the Potomac moved against Lee, who was\r\noccupying a defensive position on the south bank of the Rapidan.\r\nAfter detailing the various detachments which I was obliged to supply\r\nfor escorts and other mounted duty, I crossed the river with an\r\neffective force of about 10,000 troopers.  In the interval succeeding\r\nmy assignment to the command of the cavalry, I had taken the pains to\r\nstudy carefully the topography of the country in eastern Virginia,\r\nand felt convinced that, under the policy Meade intended I should\r\nfollow, there would be little opportunity for mounted troops to\r\nacquit themselves well in a region so thickly wooded, and traversed\r\nby so many almost parallel streams; but conscious that he would be\r\ncompelled sooner or later either to change his mind or partially give\r\nway to the pressure of events, I entered on the campaign with the\r\nloyal determination to aid zealously in all its plans.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee's army was located in its winter quarters behind\r\nintrenchments that lay along the Rapidan for a distance of about\r\ntwenty miles; extending from Barnett's to Morton's ford.  The fords\r\nbelow Morton's were watched by a few small detachments of Confederate\r\ncavalry, the main body of which, however, was encamped below\r\nHamilton's crossing, where it could draw supplies from the rich\r\ncountry along the Rappahannock.  Only a few brigades of Lee's\r\ninfantry guarded the works along the river, the bulk of it being so\r\nsituated that it could be thrown to either flank toward which the\r\nUnion troops approached.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant adopted the plan of moving by his left flank, with the\r\npurpose of compelling Lee to come out from behind his intrenchments\r\nalong Mine Run and fight on equal terms.  Grant knew well the\r\ncharacter of country through which he would have to pass, but he was\r\nconfident that the difficulties of operation in the thickly wooded\r\nregion of the Wilderness would be counterbalanced by the facility\r\nwith which his position would enable him to secure a new base; and by\r\nthe fact that as he would thus cover Washington, there would be\r\nlittle or no necessity for the authorities there to detach from his\r\nforce at some inopportune moment for the protection of that city.\r\n\r\nIn the move forward two divisions of my cavalry took the advance,\r\nGregg crossing the Rapidan at Ely's ford and Wilson at Germania ford.\r\nTorbert's division remained in the rear to cover the trains and\r\nreserve artillery, holding from Rapidan Station to Culpeper, and\r\nthence through Stevensburg to the Rappahannock River.  Gregg crossed\r\nthe Rapidan before daylight, in advance of the Second Corps, and when\r\nthe latter reached Ely's ford, he pushed on to Chancellorsville;\r\nWilson preceded the Fifth Corps to Germania ford, and when it reached\r\nthe river he made the crossing and moved rapidly by Wilderness\r\nTavern, as far as Parker's Store, from which point he sent a heavy\r\nreconnoissance toward Mine Run, the rest of his division bivouacking\r\nin a strong position.  I myself proceeded to Chancellorsville and\r\nfixed my headquarters at that place, whereon the 5th I was joined by\r\nTorbert's division.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, General Meade had crossed the Rapidan and established his\r\nheadquarters not far from Germania ford.  From that point he was in\r\ndirect communication with Wilson, whose original instructions from me\r\ncarried him only as far as Parker's Store, but it being found, during\r\nthe night of the 4th, that the enemy was apparently unacquainted with\r\nthe occurrences of the day, Meade directed Wilson to advance in the\r\ndirection of Craig's Meeting House; leaving one regiment to hold\r\nParker's Store.  Wilson with the second brigade encountered Rosser's\r\nbrigade of cavalry just beyond the Meeting House, and drove it back\r\nrapidly a distance of about two miles, holding it there till noon,\r\nwhile his first brigade was halted on the north side of Robinson's\r\nRun near the junction of the Catharpen and Parker's Store roads.\r\n\r\nUp to this time Wilson had heard nothing of the approach of the Fifth\r\nCorps, and the situation becoming threatening, he withdrew the second\r\nbrigade to the position occupied by the first, but scarcely had he\r\ndone so when he learned that at an early hour in the forenoon the\r\nenemy's infantry had appeared in his rear at Parker's Store and cut\r\noff his communication with General Meade.  Surprised at this, he\r\ndetermined to withdraw to Todd's Tavern, but before his resolution\r\ncould be put into execution the Confederates attacked him with a\r\nheavy force, and at the same time began pushing troops down the\r\nCatharpen road.  Wilson was now in a perplexing situation, sandwiched\r\nbetween the Confederates who had cut him off in the rear at Parker's\r\nstore and those occupying the Catharpen road, but he extricated his\r\ncommand by passing it around the latter force, and reached Todd's\r\nTavern by crossing the Po River at Corbin's bridge.  General Meade\r\ndiscovering that the enemy had interposed at Parker's store between\r\nWilson and the Fifth Corps, sent me word to go to Wilson's relief,\r\nand this was the first intimation I received that Wilson had been\r\npushed out so far, but, surmising that he would retire in the\r\ndirection of Todd's Tavern I immediately despatched Gregg's division\r\nthere to his relief.  Just beyond Todd's Tavern Gregg met Wilson, who\r\nwas now being followed by the enemy's cavalry.  The pursuing force\r\nwas soon checked, and then driven back to Shady Grove Church, while\r\nWilson's troops fell in behind Gregg's line, somewhat the worse for\r\ntheir morning's adventure.\r\n\r\nWhen the Army of the Potomac commenced crossing the Rapidan on the\r\n4th, General J. E. B. Stuart, commanding the Confederate cavalry,\r\nbegan concentrating his command on the right of Lee's infantry,\r\nbringing it from Hamilton's crossing and other points where it had\r\nbeen wintering.  Stuart's force at this date was a little more than\r\neight thousand men, organized in two divisions, commanded by Generals\r\nWade Hampton and Fitzhugh Lee.  Hampton's division was composed of\r\nthree brigades, commanded by Generals Cordon, Young, and Rosser;\r\nFitzhugh Lee's division comprised three brigades also, Generals W. H.\r\nF. Lee, Lomax, and Wickham commanding them.\r\n\r\nInformation of this concentration, and of the additional fact that\r\nthe enemy's cavalry about Hamilton's crossing was all being drawn in,\r\nreached me on the 5th, which obviated all necessity for my moving on\r\nthat point as I intended at the onset of the campaign.  The\r\nresponsibility for the safety of our trains and of the left flank of\r\nthe army still continued, however, so I made such dispositions of my\r\ntroops as to secure these objects by holding the line of the Brock\r\nroad beyond the Furnaces, and thence around to Todd's Tavern and\r\nPiney Branch Church.  On the 6th, through some false information,\r\nGeneral Meade became alarmed about his left flank, and sent me the\r\nfollowing note:\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,\r\n\"May 6, 1864.--1 o'clock P. M.\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN,\r\n\"Commanding Cavalry Corps\r\n\r\n\"Your despatch of 11.45 a.m., received.  General Hancock has been\r\nheavily pressed, and his left turned.  The major-general commanding\r\nthinks that you had better draw in your cavalry, so as to secure the\r\nprotection of the trains.  The order requiring an escort for the\r\nwagons to-night has been rescinded.\r\n\r\n\"A. A. HUMPHREYS,\r\n\"Major-General, Chief-of-Staff.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 6th Custer's and Devin's brigades had been\r\nseverely engaged at the Furnaces before I received the above note.\r\nThey had been most successful in repulsing the enemy's attacks,\r\nhowever, and I felt that the line taken up could be held; but the\r\ndespatch from General Humphreys was alarming, so I drew all the\r\ncavalry close in toward Chancellorsville.  It was found later that\r\nHancock's left had not been turned, and the points thus abandoned had\r\nto be regained at a heavy cost in killed and wounded, to both the\r\ncavalry and the infantry.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of May, under directions from headquarters, Army of the\r\nPotomac, the trains were put in motion to go into park at Piney\r\nBranch Church, in anticipation of the movement that was about to be\r\nmade for the possession of Spottsylvania Court House.  I felt\r\nconfident that the order to move the trains there had been given\r\nwithout a full understanding of the situation, for Piney Branch\r\nChurch was now held by the enemy, a condition which had resulted from\r\nthe order withdrawing the cavalry on account of the supposed disaster\r\nto Hancock's left the day before; but I thought the best way to\r\nremedy matters was to hold the trains in the vicinity of Aldrich's\r\ntill the ground on which it was intended to park them should be\r\nregained.\r\n\r\nThis led to the battle of Todd's Tavern, a spirited fight for the\r\npossession of the crossroads at that point, participated in by the\r\nenemy's cavalry and Gregg's division, and two brigades of Torbert's\r\ndivision, the latter commanded by Merritt, as Torbert became very ill\r\non the 6th, and had to be sent to the rear.  To gain the objective\r\npoint--the crossroads--I directed Gregg to assail the enemy on the\r\nCatharpen road with Irvin Gregg's brigade and drive him over Corbin's\r\nbridge, while Merritt attacked him with the Reserve brigade on the\r\nSpottsylvania road in conjunction with Davies's brigade of Gregg's\r\ndivision, which was to be put in on the Piney Branch Church road, and\r\nunite with Merritt's left.  Davies's and Irvin Gregg's brigades on my\r\nright and left flanks met with some resistance, yet not enough to\r\ndeter them from, executing their orders.  In front of Merritt the\r\nenemy held on more stubbornly, however, and there ensued an\r\nexceedingly severe and, at times, fluctuating fight.  Finally the\r\nConfederates gave way, and we pursued them almost to Spottsylvania\r\nCourt House; but deeming it prudent to recall the pursuers about\r\ndark, I encamped Gregg's and Merritt's divisions in the open fields\r\nto the east of Todd's Tavern.\r\n\r\nDuring the preceding three days the infantry corps of the army had\r\nbeen engaged in the various conflicts known as the battles of the\r\nWilderness.  The success of the Union troops in those battles had not\r\nbeen all that was desired, and General Grant now felt that it was\r\nnecessary to throw himself on Lee's communications if possible, while\r\npreserving his own intact by prolonging the movement to the left.\r\nTherefore, on the evening of the 7th he determined to shift his whole\r\narmy toward Spottsylvania Court House, and initiated the movement by\r\na night march of the infantry to Todd's Tavern.  In view of what was\r\ncontemplated, I gave orders to Gregg and Merritt to move at daylight\r\non the morning of the 8th, for the purpose of gaining possession of\r\nSnell's bridge over the Po River, the former by the crossing at\r\nCorbin's bridge and the latter by the Block House.  I also directed\r\nWilson, who was at Alsop's house, to take possession of Spottsylvania\r\nas early as possible on the morning of the 8th, and then move into\r\nposition at Snell's bridge conjointly with the other two divisions.\r\nWilson's orders remained as I had issued them, so he moved\r\naccordingly and got possession of Spottsylvania, driving the enemy's\r\ncavalry a mile beyond, as will be seen by the following despatch sent\r\nme at 9 A. M. of the 8th:\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,\r\n\"ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.\r\n\"SPOTTSYLVANIA COURT HOUSE, May 8, 1864 9 A. M.\r\n\"LIEUTENANT-COLONEL FORSYTH, CHIEF-OF-STAFF, C. C.\r\n\r\n\"Have run the enemy's cavalry a mile from Spottsylvania Court House;\r\nhave charged them, and drove them through the village; am fighting\r\nnow with a considerable force, supposed to be Lee's division.\r\nEverything all right.\r\n\r\n\"J. H. WILSON,\r\n\"Brigadier-General Commanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the night of the 7th General Meade arrived at Todd's Tavern\r\nand modified the orders I had given Gregg and Merritt, directing\r\nGregg simply to hold Corbin's bridge, and Merritt to move out in\r\nfront of the infantry column marching on the Spottsylvania road.\r\nMerritt proceeded to obey, but in advancing, our cavalry and infantry\r\nbecame intermingled in the darkness, and much confusion and delay was\r\nthe consequence.  I had not been duly advised of these changes in\r\nGregg's and Merritt's orders, and for a time I had fears for the\r\nsafety of Wilson, but, while he was preparing to move on to form his\r\njunction with Gregg and Merritt at Snell's bridge, the advance of\r\nAnderson (who was now commanding Longstreet's corps) appeared on the\r\nscene and drove him from Spottsylvania.\r\n\r\nHad Gregg and Merritt been permitted to proceed as they were\r\noriginally instructed, it is doubtful whether the battles fought at\r\nSpottsylvania would have occurred, for these two divisions would have\r\nencountered the enemy at the Pa River, and so delayed his march as to\r\nenable our infantry to reach Spottsylvania first, and thus force Lee\r\nto take up a line behind the Po.  I had directed Wilson to move from\r\nthe left by \"the Gate\" through Spottsylvania to Snell's bridge, while\r\nGregg and Merritt were to advance to the same point by Shady Grove\r\nand the Block House.  There was nothing to prevent at least a partial\r\nsuccess of these operations; that is to say, the concentration of the\r\nthree divisions in front of Snell's bridge, even if we could not\r\nactually have gained it.  But both that important point and the\r\nbridge on the Block House road were utterly ignored, and Lee's\r\napproach to Spottsylvania left entirely unobstructed, while three\r\ndivisions of cavalry remained practically ineffective by reason of\r\ndisjointed and irregular instructions.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 8th, when I found that such orders had been\r\ngiven, I made some strong remonstrances against the course that had\r\nbeen pursued, but it was then too late to carry out the combinations\r\nI had projected the night before, so I proceeded to join Merritt on\r\nthe Spottsylvania road.  On reaching Merritt I found General Warren\r\nmaking complaint that the cavalry were obstructing his infantry\r\ncolumn, so I drew Merritt off the road, and the leading division of\r\nthe Fifth Corps pushed up to the front.  It got into line about  11\r\no'clock, and advanced to take the village, but it did not go very far\r\nbefore it struck Anderson's corps, and was hurled back with heavy\r\nloss.  This ended all endeavor to take Spottsylvania that day.\r\n\r\nA little before noon General Meade sent for me, and when I reached\r\nhis headquarters I found that his peppery temper had got the better\r\nof his good judgment, he showing a disposition to be unjust, laying\r\nblame here and there for the blunders that had been committed.  He\r\nwas particularly severe on the cavalry, saying, among other things,\r\nthat it had impeded the march of the Fifth Corps by occupying the\r\nSpottsylvania road.  I replied that if this were true, he himself had\r\nordered it there without my knowledge.  I also told him that he had\r\nbroken up my combinations, exposed Wilson's division to disaster, and\r\nkept Gregg unnecessarily idle, and further, repelled his insinuations\r\nby saying that such disjointed operations as he had been requiring of\r\nthe cavalry for the last four days would render the corps inefficient\r\nand useless before long.  Meade was very much irritated, and I was\r\nnone the less so.  One word brought on another, until, finally, I\r\ntold him that I could whip Stuart if he (Meade) would only let me,\r\nbut since he insisted on giving the cavalry directions without\r\nconsulting or even notifying me, he could henceforth command the\r\nCavalry Corps himself--that I would not give it another order.\r\n\r\nThe acrimonious interview ended with this remark, and after I left\r\nhim he went to General Grant's headquarters and repeated the\r\nconversation to him, mentioning that I had said that I could whip\r\nStuart.  At this General Grant remarked: \"Did he say so? Then let him\r\ngo out and do it.\"  This intimation was immediately acted upon by\r\nGeneral Meade, and a little later the following order came to me:\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC\r\n\"May 8th, 1864 1 P. M.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL SHERIDAN,\r\n\"Commanding Cavalry Corps.\r\n\r\n\"The major-general commanding directs you to immediately concentrate\r\nyour available mounted force, and with your ammunition trains and\r\nsuch supply trains as are filled (exclusive of ambulances) proceed\r\nagainst the enemy's cavalry, and when your supplies are exhausted,\r\nproceed via New Market and Green Bay to Haxall's Landing on the James\r\nRiver, there communicating with General Butler, procuring supplies\r\nand return to this army.  Your dismounted men will be left with the\r\ntrain here.\r\n\r\n\"A. A. HUMPHREYS,\r\n\"Major-General, Chief-of-staff.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the above order was received I issued instructions for the\r\nconcentration of the three divisions of cavalry at Aldrich's to\r\nprepare for the contemplated expedition.  Three days' rations for the\r\nmen were distributed, and half rations of grain for one day were\r\ndoled out for the horses.  I sent for Gregg, Merritt, and Wilson and\r\ncommunicated the order to them, saying at the same time, \"We are\r\ngoing out to fight Stuart's cavalry in consequence of a suggestion\r\nfrom me; we will give him a fair, square fight; we are strong, and I\r\nknow we can beat him, and in view of my recent representations to\r\nGeneral Meade I shall expect nothing but success.\"  I also indicated\r\nto my division commanders the line of march I should take--moving in\r\none column around the right flank of Lee's army to get in its rear\r\n--and stated at the same time that it was my intention to fight Stuart\r\nwherever he presented himself, and if possible go through to Haxall's\r\nLanding; but that if Stuart should successfully interpose between us\r\nand that point we would swing back to the Army of the Potomac by\r\npassing around the enemy's left flank by way of Gordonsville.  At\r\nfirst the proposition seemed to surprise the division commanders\r\nsomewhat, for hitherto even the boldest, mounted expeditions had been\r\nconfined to a hurried ride through the enemy's country, without\r\npurpose of fighting more than enough to escape in case of\r\nmolestation, and here and there to destroy a bridge.  Our move would\r\nbe a challenge to Stuart for a cavalry duel behind Lee's lines, in\r\nhis own country, but the advantages which it was reasonable to\r\nanticipate from the plan being quickly perceived, each division\r\ncommander entered into its support unhesitatingly, and at once set\r\nabout preparing for the march next day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE EXPEDITION STARTS--DESTROYING SUPPLIES--OPENING OF THE FIGHT AT\r\nYELLOW TAVERN--GENERAL CUSTER'S BRILLIANT CHARGE--DEATH OF GENERAL\r\nSTUART--REMOVING TORPEDOES--EXCITEMENT IN RICHMOND--A NIGHT MARCH\r\n--ENTERPRISING NEWSBOYS--THE EFFECTS OF STUART'S DEFEAT AND DEATH\r\n--END OF THE FIRST EXPEDITION--ITS GREAT SUCCESS AND BENEFICIAL\r\nRESULTS.\r\n\r\nThe expedition which resulted in the battle of Yellow Tavern and the\r\ndeath of General Stuart started from the vicinity of Aldrich's toward\r\nFredericksburg early on the morning of May 9, 1864, marching on the\r\nplank-road, Merritt's division leading.  When the column reached\r\nTabernacle Church it headed almost due east to the telegraph road,\r\nand thence down that highway to Thornburg, and from that point\r\nthrough Childsburg to Anderson's crossing of the North Anna River, it\r\nbeing my desire to put my command south of that stream if possible,\r\nwhere it could procure forage before it should be compelled to fight.\r\nThe corps moved at a walk, three divisions on the same road, making a\r\ncolumn nearly thirteen miles in length, and marched around the right\r\nflank of the enemy unsuspected until my rear guard had passed\r\nMassaponax Church.  Although the column was very long, I preferred to\r\nmove it all on one road rather than to attempt combinations for\r\ncarrying the divisions to any given point by different routes.\r\nUnless the separate commands in an expedition of this nature are very\r\nprompt in movement, and each fully equal to overcoming at once any\r\nobstacle it may meet, combinations rarely work out as expected;\r\nbesides, an engagement was at all times imminent, hence it was\r\nspecially necessary to keep the whole force well together.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Ny, Po, and Ta rivers were crossed, each of which\r\nstreams would have afforded an excellent defensive line to the enemy,\r\nall anxiety as to our passing around Lee's army was removed, and our\r\nability to cross the North Anna placed beyond doubt. Meanwhile\r\nGeneral Stuart had discovered what we were about, and he set his\r\ncavalry in motion, sending General Fitzhugh Lee to follow and attack\r\nmy rear on the Childsburg road, Stuart himself marching by way of\r\nDavenport's bridge, on the North Anna, toward Beaver Dam Station,\r\nnear which place his whole command was directed to unite the next\r\nday.\r\n\r\nMy column having passed the Ta River, Stuart attacked its rear with\r\nconsiderable vigor, in the hope that he could delay my whole force\r\nlong enough to permit him to get at least a part of his command in my\r\nfront; but this scheme was frustrated by Davies's brigade, which I\r\ndirected to fight as a rear-guard, holding on at one position and\r\nthen at another along the line of march just enough to deter the\r\nenemy from a too rapid advance.  Davies performed this responsible\r\nand trying duty with tact and good judgment, following the main\r\ncolumn steadily as it progressed to the south, and never once\r\npermitting Fitzhugh Lee's advance to encroach far enough to compel a\r\nhalt of my main body.  About dark Merritt's division crossed the\r\nNorth Anna at Anderson's ford, while Gregg and Wilson encamped on the\r\nnorth side, having engaged the enemy, who still hung on my rear up to\r\na late hour at night.\r\n\r\nAfter Merritt's division passed the river, Custer's brigade proceeded\r\non to Beaver Dam Station to cut the Virginia Central railroad.\r\nBefore reaching the station he met a small force of the enemy, but\r\nthis he speedily drove off, recapturing from it about four hundred\r\nUnion prisoners, who had been taken recently in the Wilderness and\r\nwere being conducted to Richmond.  Custer also destroyed the station,\r\ntwo locomotives, three trains of cars, ninety wagons, from eight to\r\nten miles of railroad and telegraph lines, some two hundred thousand\r\npounds of bacon and other supplies, amounting in all to about a\r\nmillion and a half of rations, and nearly all they medical stores of\r\nGeneral Lee's army, which had been moved from Orange Court House\r\neither because Lee wished to have them directly in his rear or\r\nbecause he contemplated falling back to the North Anna.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 10th Gregg and Wilson, while crossing the North\r\nAnna, were again attacked, but were covered by the division on the\r\nsouth side of the stream; the passage was effected without much loss,\r\nnotwithstanding the approach of Stuart on the south bank from the\r\ndirection of Davenport's bridge.  The possession of Beaver Dam gave\r\nus an important point, as it opened a way toward Richmond by the\r\nNegro-foot road.  It also enabled us to obtain forage for our\r\nwell-nigh famished animals, and to prepare for fighting the enemy,\r\nwho, I felt sure, would endeavor to interpose between my column and\r\nRichmond.\r\n\r\nStuart had hardly united his troops near Beaver Dam when he realized\r\nthat concentrating there was a mistake, so he began making\r\ndispositions for remedying his error, and while we leisurely took the\r\nNegro-foot toad toward Richmond, he changed his tactics and hauled\r\noff from my rear, urging his horses to the death in order to get in\r\nbetween Richmond and my column.  This he effected about 10 o'clock on\r\nthe morning of the 11th, concentrating at Yellow Tavern, six miles\r\nfrom the city, on the Brook turnpike.  His change of tactics left my\r\nmarch on the 10th practically unmolested, and we quietly encamped\r\nthat night on the south bank of the South Anna, near Ground Squirrel\r\nBridge.  Here we procured an abundance of forage, and as the distance\r\ntraveled that day had been only fifteen to eighteen miles, men and\r\nhorses were able to obtain a good rest during the night.\r\n\r\nAt 2 o'clock in the morning, May 11, Davies's brigade of Gregg's\r\ndivision marched for Ashland to cut the Fredericksburg railroad.\r\nArriving there before the head of the enemy's column, which had to\r\npass through this same place to reach Yellow Tavern, Davies drove out\r\na small force occupying the town, burnt a train of cars and a\r\nlocomotive, destroyed the railroad for some distance, and rejoined\r\nthe main column at Allen's Station on the Fredericksburg and Richmond\r\nrailroad.  From Allen's Station the whole command moved on Yellow\r\nTavern, Merritt in the lead, Wilson following, and Gregg in the rear.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of Davies's brigade at Ashland in the morning had had\r\nthe effect of further mystifying the enemy as to my intentions; and\r\nwhile he held it incumbent to place himself between me and Richmond,\r\nyet he was still so uncertain of my movements that he committed the\r\nsame fault that he did the first day, when he divided his force and\r\nsent a part to follow me on the Childsburg road.  He now divided his\r\ncommand again, sending a portion to hang upon my rear, while he\r\nproceeded with the rest to Yellow Tavern.  This separation not only\r\nmaterially weakened the force which might have been thrown across my\r\nline of march, but it also enabled me to attack with almost my entire\r\ncorps, while occupying the pursuers with a small rearguard.\r\n\r\nBy forced marches General Stuart succeeded in reaching Yellow Tavern\r\nahead of me on May 11; and the presence of, his troops, on the\r\nAshland and Richmond road becoming known to Merritt as he was\r\napproaching the Brook turnpike, this general pressed forward at once\r\nto the attack.  Pushing his division to the front, he soon got\r\npossession of the turnpike and drove the enemy back several hundred\r\nyards to the east of it.  This success had the effect of throwing the\r\nhead of my column to the east of the pike, and I quickly brought up\r\nWilson and one of Gregg's brigades to take advantage of the situation\r\nby forming a line of battle on that side or the road.  Meanwhile the\r\nenemy, desperate but still confident, poured in a heavy fire from his\r\nline and from a battery which enfiladed the Brook road, and made\r\nYellow Tavern an uncomfortably hot place.  Gibbs's and Devin's\r\nbrigades, however, held fast there, while Custer, supported by\r\nChapman's brigade, attacked the enemy's left and battery in a mounted\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nCuster's charge, with Chapman on his flank and the rest of Wilson's\r\ndivision sustaining him, was brilliantly executed.  Beginning at a\r\nwalk, he increased his gait to a trot, and then at full speed rushed\r\nat the enemy.  At the same moment the dismounted troops along my\r\nwhole front moved forward, and as Custer went through the battery,\r\ncapturing two of the guns with their cannoneers and breaking up the\r\nenemy's left, Gibbs and Devin drove his centre and right from the\r\nfield.  Gregg meanwhile, with equal success, charged the force in his\r\nrear-Gordon's brigadeand the engagement ended by giving us complete\r\ncontrol of the road to Richmond.  We captured a number of prisoners,\r\nand the casualties on both sides were quite severe, General Stuart\r\nhimself falling mortally wounded, and General James B. Gordon, one of\r\nhis brigade commanders, being killed.\r\n\r\nAfter Custer's charge, the Confederate cavalry was badly broken up,\r\nthe main portion of it being driven in a rout toward Ashland and a\r\nsmall part in the direction of Richmond, which latter force finally\r\nrejoined Fitzhugh Lee near Mechanicsville.  A reconnoitring party\r\nbeing now sent up the Brook turnpike toward the city, dashed across\r\nthe South Fork of the Chickahominy, drove a small force from the\r\nenemy's exterior intrenchments and went within them.  I followed this\r\nparty, and after a little exploration found between the two lines of\r\nworks a country road that led across to the pike which runs from\r\nMechanicsville to Richmond.  I thought we could go around within the\r\nouter line of works by this country road across to the Mechanicsville\r\npike on the south side of the Chickahominy, and encamp the next night\r\nat Fair Oaks; so I determined to make the movement after dark, being\r\ninfluenced in this to some extent by reports received during the\r\nafternoon from colored people, to the effect that General B. F.\r\nButler's army had reached a small stream on the south side of the\r\nJames, about four miles south of Richmond.  If I could succeed in\r\ngetting through by this road, not only would I have a shorter line of\r\nmarch to Haxall's landing, but there was also a possibility that I\r\ncould help Butler somewhat by joining him so near Richmond.\r\nTherefore, after making the wounded as comfortable as possible, we\r\ncommenced the march about 11 o'clock on the night of the 11th, and\r\nmassed the command on the plateau south of the Meadow bridge near\r\ndaylight on the 12th.\r\n\r\nThe enemy, anticipating that I would march by this route, had planted\r\ntorpedoes along it, and many of these exploded as the column passed\r\nover them, killing several horses and wounding a few men, but beyond\r\nthis we met with no molestation.  The torpedoes were loaded shells\r\nplanted on each side of the road, and so connected by wires attached\r\nto friction-tubes in the shells, that when a horse's hoof struck a\r\nwire the shell was exploded by the jerk on the improvised lanyard.\r\nAfter the loss of several horses and the wounding of some of the men\r\nby these torpedoes, I gave directions to have them removed, if\r\npracticable, so about twenty-five of the prisoners were brought up\r\nand made to get down on their knees, feel for the wires in the\r\ndarkness, follow them up and unearth the shells.  The prisoners\r\nreported the owner of one of the neighboring houses to be the\r\nprincipal person who had engaged in planting these shells, and I\r\ntherefore directed that some of them be carried and placed in the\r\ncellar of his house, arranged to explode if the enemy's column came\r\nthat way, while he and his family were brought off as prisoners and\r\nheld till after daylight.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the most intense excitement prevailed in Richmond.  The\r\nConfederates, supposing that their capital was my objective point,\r\nwere straining every effort to put it in a state of defense, and had\r\ncollected between four and five thousand irregular troops, under\r\nGeneral Bragg, besides bringing up three brigades of infantry from\r\nthe force confronting General Butler south of the James River, the\r\nalarm being intensified by the retreat, after the defeat at Yellow\r\nTavern, of Stuart's cavalry, now under General Fitzhugh Lee, by way\r\nof Ashland to Mechanicsville, on the north side of the Chickahominy,\r\nfor falling back in that direction, left me between them and\r\nRichmond.\r\n\r\nOur march during the night of the 11th was very tedious, on account\r\nof the extreme darkness and frequent showers of rain; but at daylight\r\non the 12th the head of my column, under Wilson, reached the\r\nMechanicsville pike.  Here Wilson, encountering the enemy's works and\r\nbatteries manned by General Bragg's troops, endeavored to pass.  In\r\nthis he failed, and as soon as I was notified that it was\r\nimpracticable to reach Fair Oaks by passing between the works and the\r\nChickahominy, Custer's brigade was directed to make the crossing to\r\nthe north side of the Chickahominy, at the Meadow bridge.  Custer\r\nmoved rapidly for the bridge, but found it destroyed, and that the\r\nenemy's cavalry was posted on the north side, in front of\r\nMechanicsville.  When this information came back, I ordered Merritt\r\nto take his whole division and repair the bridge, instructing him\r\nthat the crossing must be made at all hazards; for, in view of an\r\nimpending attack by the enemy's infantry in Richmond, it was\r\nnecessary that I should have the bridge as a means of egress in case\r\nof serious disaster.\r\n\r\nAll the time that Merritt was occupied in this important duty, the\r\nenemy gave great annoyance to the working party by sweeping the\r\nbridge with a section of artillery and a fire from the supporting\r\ntroops, so a small force was thrown across to drive them away.\r\nWhen Merritt had passed two regiments over, they attacked, but\r\nwere repulsed.  The work on the bridge continued, however,\r\nnot-withstanding this discomfiture; and when it was finished, Merritt\r\ncrossed nearly all his division, dismounted, and again attacked the\r\nenemy, this time carrying the line, of temporary breastworks, built\r\nwith logs and rails, and pursuing his broken troops toward Gaines's\r\nMills.\r\n\r\nWhile Merritt was engaged in this affair, the Confederates advanced\r\nfrom behind their works at Richmond, and attacked Wilson and Gregg.\r\nWilson's troops were driven back in some confusion at first; but\r\nGregg, in anticipation of attack, had hidden a heavy line of\r\ndismounted men in a bushy ravine on his front, and when the enemy\r\nmarched upon it, with much display and under the eye of the President\r\nof the Confederacy, this concealed line opened a destructive fire\r\nwith repeating carbines; and at the same time the batteries of\r\nhorse-artillery, under Captain Robinson, joining in the contest,\r\nbelched forth shot and shell with fatal effect.  The galling fire\r\ncaused the enemy to falter, and while still wavering Wilson rallied\r\nhis men, and turning some of them against the right flank of the\r\nConfederates, broke their line, and compelled them to withdraw for\r\nsecurity behind the heavy works thrown up for the defense of the city\r\nin 1862.\r\n\r\nBy destroying the Meadow bridge and impeding my column on the\r\nMechanicsville, pike, the enemy thought to corner us completely, for\r\nhe still maintained the force in Gregg's rear that had pressed it the\r\nday before; but the repulse of his infantry ended all his hopes of\r\ndoing us any serious damage on the limited ground between the\r\ndefenses of Richmond and the Chickahominy.  He felt certain that on\r\naccount of the recent heavy rains we could not cross the Chickahominy\r\nexcept by the Meadow bridge, and it also seemed clear to him that we\r\ncould not pass between the river and his intrenchments; therefore he\r\nhoped to ruin us, or at least compel us to return by the same route\r\nwe had taken in coming, in which case we would run into Gordon's\r\nbrigade, but the signal repulse of Bragg's infantry dispelled these\r\nillusions.\r\n\r\nEven had it not been our good fortune to defeat him, we could have\r\ncrossed the Chickahominy if necessary at several points that were\r\ndiscovered by scouting parties which, while the engagement was going\r\non, I had sent out to look up fords.  This means of getting out from\r\nthe circumscribed plateau I did not wish to use, however, unless\r\nthere was no alternative, for I wished to demonstrate to the Cavalry\r\nCorps the impossibility of the enemy's destroying or capturing so\r\nlarge a body of mounted troops.\r\n\r\nThe chances of seriously injuring, us were more favorable to the\r\nenemy this time than ever they were afterward, for with the troops\r\nfrom Richmond, comprising three brigades of veterans and about five\r\nthousand irregulars on my front and right flank, with Gordon's\r\ncavalry in the rear, and Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry on my left flank,\r\nholding the Chickahominy and Meadow bridge, I was apparently hemmed\r\nin on every side, but relying on the celerity with which mounted\r\ntroops could be moved, I felt perfectly confident that the seemingly\r\nperilous situation could be relieved under circumstances even worse\r\nthan those then surrounding us.  Therefore, instead of endeavoring to\r\nget away without a fight, I concluded that there would be little\r\ndifficulty in withdrawing, even should I be beaten, and none whatever\r\nif I defeated the enemy.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this view I accepted battle; and the complete\r\nrepulse of the enemy's infantry, which assailed us from his\r\nintrenchments, and of Gordon's cavalry, which pressed Gregg on the\r\nBrook road, ended the contest in our favor.  The rest of the day we\r\nremained on the battle-field undisturbed, and our time was spent in\r\ncollecting the wounded, burying the dead, grazing the horses, and\r\nreading the Richmond journals, two small newsboys with commendable\r\nenterprise having come within our lines from the Confederate capital\r\nto sell their papers.  They were sharp youngsters, and having come\r\nwell supplied, they did a thrifty business.  When their stock in\r\ntrade was all disposed of they wished to return, but they were so\r\nintelligent and observant that I thought their mission involved other\r\npurposes than the mere sale of newspapers, so they were held till we\r\ncrossed the Chickahominy and then turned loose.\r\n\r\nAfter Merritt had crossed the Chickahominy and reached\r\nMechanicsville, I sent him orders to push on to Gaines's Mills.  Near\r\nthe latter place he fell in with the enemy's cavalry again, and\r\nsending me word, about 4 o'clock in the afternoon I crossed the\r\nChickahominy with Wilson and Gregg, but when we overtook Merritt he\r\nhad already brushed the Confederates away, and my whole command went\r\ninto camp between Walnut Grove and Gaines's Mills.\r\n\r\nThe main purposes of the expedition had now been executed. They were\r\n\"to break up General Lee's railroad communications, destroy such\r\ndepots of supplies as could be found in his rear, and to defeat\r\nGeneral Stuart's cavalry.\"  Many miles of the Virginia Central and of\r\nthe Richmond and Fredericksburg railroads were broken up, and\r\nseveral of the bridges on each burnt.  At Beaver Dam, Ashland, and\r\nother places, about two millions of rations had been captured and\r\ndestroyed. The most important of all, however, was the defeat of\r\nStuart.  Since the beginning of the war this general had\r\ndistinguished himself by his management of the Confederate mounted\r\nforce.  Under him the cavalry of Lee's army had been nurtured, and\r\nhad acquired such prestige that it thought itself well-nigh\r\ninvincible; indeed, in the early years of the war it had proved to be\r\nso.  This was now dispelled by the successful march we had made in\r\nLee's rear; and the discomfiture of Stuart at Yellow Tavern had\r\ninflicted a blow from which entire recovery was impossible.\r\n\r\nIn its effect on the Confederate cause the defeat of Stuart was most\r\ndisheartening, but his death was even a greater calamity, as is\r\nevidenced by the words of a Confederate writer (Cooke), who says:\r\n\"Stuart could be ill spared at this critical moment, and General Lee\r\nwas plunged into the deepest melancholy at the intelligence of his\r\ndeath.  When it reached him he retired from those around him, and\r\nremained for some time communing with his own heart and memory.  When\r\none of his staff entered and spoke of Stuart, General Lee said: 'I\r\ncan scarcely think of him without weeping.'\"\r\n\r\nFrom the camp near Gaines's Mills I resumed the march to Haxall's\r\nLanding, the point on the James River contemplated in my instructions\r\nwhere I was to obtain supplies from General Butler.  We got to the\r\nJames on the 14th with all our wounded and a large number of\r\nprisoners, and camped between Haxall's and Shirley.  The prisoners,\r\nas well as the captured guns, were turned over to General Butler's\r\nprovost-marshal, and our wounded were quickly and kindly cared for by\r\nhis surgeons.  Ample supplies, also, in the way of forage and\r\nrations, were furnished us by General Butler, and the work of\r\nrefitting for our return to the Army of the Potomac was vigorously\r\npushed. By the 17th all was ready, and having learned by scouting\r\nparties sent in the direction of Richmond and as far as Newmarket\r\nthat the enemy's cavalry was returning to Lee's army I started that\r\nevening on my return march, crossing the Chickahominy at Jones's\r\nbridge, and bivouacking on the 19th near Baltimore crossroads.\r\n\r\nMy uncertainty of what had happened to the Army of the Potomac in our\r\nabsence, and as to where I should find it, made our getting back a\r\nproblem somewhat difficult of solution, particularly as I knew that\r\nreinforcements for Lee had come up from the south to Richmond, and\r\nthat most likely some of these troops were being held at different\r\npoints on the route to intercept my column.  Therefore I determined\r\nto pass the Pamunkey River at the White House, and sent to Fort\r\nMonroe for a pontoon-bridge on which to make the crossing.  While\r\nwaiting for the pontoons I ordered Custer to proceed with his brigade\r\nto Hanover Station, to destroy the railroad bridge over the South\r\nAnna, a little beyond that place; at the same time I sent Gregg and\r\nWilson to Cold Harbor, to demonstrate in the direction of Richmond as\r\nfar as Mechanicsville, so as to cover Custer's movements.  Merritt,\r\nwith the remaining brigades of his division, holding fast at\r\nBaltimore crossroads to await events.\r\n\r\nAfter Gregg and Custer had gone, it was discovered that the railroad\r\nbridge over the Pamunkey, near the White House, had been destroyed\r\nbut partially--the cross-ties and stringers being burned in places\r\nonly--and that it was practicable to repair it sufficiently to carry\r\nus over.  In view of this information General Merritt's two brigades\r\nwere at once put on the duty of reconstructing the bridge.  By\r\nsending mounted parties through the surrounding country, each man of\r\nwhich would bring in a board or a plank, Merritt soon accumulated\r\nenough lumber for the flooring, and in one day the bridge was made\r\npracticable.  On the 22d Gregg, Wilson, and Custer returned.  The\r\nlatter had gone on his expedition as far as Hanover Station,\r\ndestroyed some commissary stores there, and burned two trestle\r\nbridges over Hanover Creek.  This done, he deemed it prudent to\r\nretire to Hanovertown.  The next morning he again marched to Hanover\r\nStation, and there ascertained that a strong force of the enemy,\r\nconsisting of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, was posted at the\r\nSouth Anna bridges.  These troops had gone there from Richmond en\r\nroute to reinforce Lee.  In the face of this impediment Custer's\r\nmission could not be executed fully, so he returned to Baltimore\r\ncrossroads.\r\n\r\nThe whole command was drawn in by noon of the 22d, and that day it\r\ncrossed the Pamunkey by Merritt's reconstructed bridge, marching to\r\nAyletts, on the Mattapony River, the same night.  Here I learned from\r\ncitizens, and from prisoners taken during the day by scouting parties\r\nsent toward Hanover Court House, that Lee had been, forced from his\r\nposition near Spottsylvania Court House and compelled to retire to\r\nthe line of the North Anna.  I then determined to rejoin the Army of\r\nthe Potomac at the earliest moment, which I did by making for\r\nChesterfield Station, where I reported to General Meade on the 24th\r\nof May.\r\n\r\nOur return to Chesterfield ended the first independent expedition the\r\nCavalry Corps had undertaken since coming under my command, and our\r\nsuccess was commended highly by Generals Grant and Meade, both\r\nrealizing that our operations in the rear of Lee had disconcerted and\r\nalarmed that general so much as to aid materially in forcing his\r\nretrograde march, and both acknowledged that, by drawing off the\r\nenemy's cavalry during the past fortnight, we had enabled them to\r\nmove the Army of the Potomac and its enormous trains without\r\nmolestation in the manoeuvres that had carried it to the North Anna.\r\nThen, too, great quantities of provisions and munitions of war had\r\nbeen destroyed--stores that the enemy had accumulated at sub-depots\r\nfrom strained resources and by difficult means; the railroads that\r\nconnected Lee with Richmond broken, the most successful cavalry\r\nleader of the South killed, and in addition to all this there had\r\nbeen inflicted on the Confederate mounted troops the most thorough\r\ndefeat that had yet befallen them in Virginia.\r\n\r\nWhen the expedition set out the Confederate authorities in Richmond\r\nwere impressed, and indeed convinced, that my designs contemplated\r\nthe capture of that city, and notwithstanding the loss they sustained\r\nin the defeat and death of Stuart, and their repulse the succeeding\r\nday, they drew much comfort from the fact that I had not entered\r\ntheir capital.  Some Confederate writers have continued to hold this\r\ntheory and conviction since the war.  In this view they were and are\r\nin error.  When Stuart was defeated the main purpose of my\r\ninstructions had been carried out, and my thoughts then turned to\r\njoining General Butler to get supplies.  I believed that I could do\r\nthis by cutting across to the Mechanicsville pike and Fair Oaks on\r\nthe south side of the Chickahominy, but the failure of Wilson's\r\ncolumn to get possession of the outwork which commanded the pike\r\nnecessitated my crossing at Meadow bridge, and then moving by\r\nMechanicsville and Gaines's Mills instead of by the shorter route.\r\nMoreover, my information regarding General Butler's position was\r\nincorrect, so that even had I been successful in getting to Fair Oaks\r\nby the direct road I should still have gained nothing thereby, for I\r\nshould still have been obliged to continue down the James River to\r\nHaxall's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nGENERAL WILSON'S ADVANCE TOWARD HANOVER COURT HOUSE--CROSSING THE\r\nPAMUNKEY--ENGAGEMENT OF HAWE'S SHOP--FIGHT AT MATADEQUIN CREEK\r\n--CAPTURE OF COLD HARBOR--THE FIGHT TO RETAIN THE PLACE--MOVEMENTS\r\nOF GENERAL WILSON.\r\n\r\nWhen I rejoined the Army of the Potomac, near Chesterfield Station,\r\nthe heavy battles around Spottsylvania had been fought, and the\r\ncomplicated manoeuvres by which the whole Union force was swung\r\nacross the North Anna were in process of execution.  In conjunction\r\nwith these manoeuvres Wilson's division was sent to the right flank\r\nof the army, where he made a reconnoissance south of the North Anna\r\nas far as Little River, crossing the former stream near Jericho\r\nMills.  Wilson was to operate from day to day on that flank as it\r\nswung to the south, covering to New Castle ferry each advance of the\r\ninfantry and the fords left behind on the march.  From the 26th to\r\nthe 30th these duties kept Wilson constantly occupied, and also\r\nnecessitated a considerable dispersion of his force, but by the 31st\r\nhe was enabled to get all his division together again, and crossing\r\nto the south side of the Pamunkey at New Castle ferry, he advanced\r\ntoward Hanover Court House.  Near Dr Pride's house he encountered a\r\ndivision of the enemy's cavalry under General W. H. F. Lee, and drove\r\nit back across Mechamp's Creek, thus opening communication with the\r\nright of our infantry resting near Phillips's Mills.  Just as this\r\nhad been done, a little before dark, Wilson received an order from\r\nGeneral Meade directing him to push on toward Richmond until he\r\nencountered the Confederates in such strength that he could no longer\r\nsuccessfully contend against them, and in compliance with this order\r\noccupied Hanover Court House that same day.  Resuming his march at\r\ndaylight on June 1, he went ahead on the Ashland road while sending\r\nChapman's brigade up the south bank of the South Anna to destroy the\r\nbridges on that stream.  Chapman having succeeded in this work,\r\nWilson re-united his whole command and endeavored to hold Ashland,\r\nbut finding the Confederate cavalry and infantry there in strong\r\nforce, he was obliged to withdraw to Dr. Price's house.  Here he\r\nlearned that the army had gone to the left toward Cold Harbor, so on\r\nthe 2d of June he moved to Hawe's Shop.\r\n\r\nWhile Wilson was operating thus on the right, I had to cover with\r\nGregg's and Torbert's divisions the crossing of the army over the\r\nPamunkey River at and near Hanovertown.  Torbert having recovered\r\nfrom the illness which overtook him in the Wilderness, had now\r\nreturned to duty.  The march to turn the enemy's right began on the\r\n26th.  Torbert and Gregg in advance, to secure the crossings of the\r\nPamunkey and demonstrate in such manner as to deceive the enemy as\r\nmuch as possible in the movement, the two cavalry divisions being\r\nsupported by General D. A. Russell's division of the Sixth Corps.\r\n\r\nTo attain this end in the presence of an ever-watchful foe who had\r\njust recently been reinforced in considerable numbers from Richmond\r\nand further south--almost enough to make up the losses he had\r\nsustained in the Wilderness and at Spottsylvania--required the most\r\nvigorous and zealous work on the part of those to whom had been\r\nallotted the task of carrying out the initial manoeuvres.  Torbert\r\nstarted for Taylor's ford on the Pamunkey with directions to\r\ndemonstrate heavily at that point till after dark, as if the crossing\r\nwas to be made there, and having thus impressed the enemy, he was to\r\nleave a small guard, withdraw quietly, and march to Hanovertown ford,\r\nwhere the real crossing was to be effected.  Meanwhile Gregg marched\r\nto Littlepage's crossing of the Pamunkey, with instructions to make\r\nfeints in the same manner as Torbert until after dark, when he was to\r\nretire discreetly, leaving a small force to keep up the\r\ndemonstration, and then march rapidly to Hanovertown crossing, taking\r\nwith him the pontoon-bridge.\r\n\r\nAt the proper hour Russell took up the march and followed the\r\ncavalry.  The troops were in motion all night, undergoing the usual\r\ndelays incident to night marches, and, early on the morning of the\r\n27th the crossing was made, Custer's brigade of Torbert's division\r\ndriving from the ford about one hundred of the enemy's cavalry, and\r\ncapturing between thirty and forty prisoners.  The remainder of\r\nTorbert's division followed this brigade and advanced to Hanovertown,\r\nwhere General Gordon's brigade of Confederate cavalry was met.\r\nTorbert attacked this force with Devin's brigade, while he sent\r\nCuster to Hawe's Shop, from which point a road leading to the right\r\nwas taken that brought him in rear of the enemy's cavalry; when the\r\nConfederates discovered this manoeuvre, they retired in the direction\r\nof Hanover Court House.  Pursuit continued as far as a little stream\r\ncalled Crump's Creek, and here Torbert was halted, Gregg moving up on\r\nhis line meanwhile, and Russell encamping near the crossing of the\r\nriver.  This completed our task of gaining a foothold south of the\r\nPamunkey, and on the 28th the main army crossed unharassed and took\r\nup a position behind my line, extending south from the river, with\r\nthe Sixth Corps on the right across the Hanover Court House road at\r\nCrump's Creek, the Second Corps on the left of the Sixth, and the\r\nFifth Corps about two miles in front of Hanovertown, its left\r\nextending to the Tolopotomy.\r\n\r\nThere was now much uncertainty in General Grant's mind as to the\r\nenemy's whereabouts, and there were received daily the most\r\nconflicting statements as to the nature of Lee's movements.  It\r\nbecame necessary, therefore, to find out by an actual demonstration\r\nwhat Lee was doing, and I was required to reconnoitre in the\r\ndirection of Mechanicsville.  For this purpose I moved Gregg's\r\ndivision out toward this town by way of Hawe's Shop, and when it had\r\ngone about three-fourths of a mile beyond the Shop the enemy's\r\ncavalry was discovered dismounted and disposed behind a temporary\r\nbreastwork of rails and logs.\r\n\r\nThis was the first occasion on which, since the battle of Yellow\r\nTavern, the Confederate troopers had confronted us in large numbers,\r\ntheir mounted operations, like ours, having been dependent more or\r\nless on the conditions that grew out of the movements in which Lee's\r\ninfantry had been engaged since the 14th of May.\r\n\r\nOn that date General Lee had foreshadowed his intention of using his\r\ncavalry in connection with the manoeuvres of his infantry by issuing\r\nan order himself, now that Stuart was dead, directing that the \"three\r\ndivisions of cavalry serving with the army [Lee's] will constitute\r\nseparate commands, and will report directly to and receive orders\r\nfrom the headquarters of the army.\"  The order indicates that since\r\nStuart's death the Confederate cavalry had been re-organized into\r\nthree divisions, that were commanded respectively by General Wade\r\nHampton, General Fitzhugh Lee, and General W. H. F. Lee, the\r\nadditional division organization undoubtedly growing out of the fact,\r\nthat General M. C. Butler's brigade of about four thousand men had\r\njoined recently from South Carolina.\r\n\r\nWhen this force developed in Gregg's front, he attacked the moment\r\nhis troops could be dismounted; and the contest became one of\r\nexceeding stubborness, for he found confronting him Hampton's and\r\nFitzhugh Lee's divisions, supported by what we then supposed to be a\r\nbrigade of infantry, but which, it has since been ascertained, was\r\nButler's brigade of mounted troops; part of them armed with\r\nlong-range rifles.  The contest between the opposing forces was of\r\nthe severest character and continued till late in the evening.  The\r\nvarying phases of the fight prompted me to reinforce Gregg as much as\r\npossible, so I directed Custer's brigade to report to him, sending,\r\nmeanwhile, for the other two brigades of Torbert, but these were not\r\navailable at the time--on account of delays which occurred in\r\nrelieving them from the line at Crump's Creek--and did not get up\r\ntill the fight was over.  As soon as Custer joined him, Gregg\r\nvigorously assaulted the Confederate position along his whole front;\r\nand notwithstanding the long-range rifles of the South Carolinians,\r\nwho were engaging in their first severe combat it appears, and fought\r\nmost desperately, he penetrated their barricades at several points.\r\n\r\nThe most determined and obstinate efforts for success were now made\r\non both sides, as the position at Hawe's Shop had become of very\r\ngreat importance on account of the designs of both Lee and Grant.\r\nLee wished to hold this ground while he manoeuvred his army to the\r\nline of the Tolopotomy, where he could cover the roads to Richmond,\r\nwhile Grant, though first sending me out merely to discover by a\r\nstrong reconnoissance the movements of the enemy, saw the value of\r\nthe place to cover his new base at the White House, and also to give\r\nus possession of a direct road to Cold Harbor.  Hawe's Shop remained\r\nin our possession finally, for late in the evening Custer's brigade\r\nwas dismounted and formed in close column in rear of Gregg, and while\r\nit assaulted through an opening near the centre of his line, the\r\nother two brigades advanced and carried the temporary works.  The\r\nenemy's dead and many of his wounded fell into our hands; also a\r\nconsiderable number of prisoners, from whom we learned that\r\nLongstreet's and Ewell's corps were but four miles to the rear.\r\n\r\nThe battle was a decidedly severe one, the loss on each side being\r\nheavy in proportion to the number of troops engaged.  This fight took\r\nplace almost immediately in front of our infantry, which, during the\r\nlatter part of the contest, was busily occupied in throwing up\r\nintrenchments.  Late in the afternoon I reported to General Meade the\r\npresence of the enemy's infantry, and likewise that Hampton's and\r\nFitzhugh Lee's divisions were in my front also, and asked, at the\r\nsame time; that some of our infantry, which was near at hand, be sent\r\nto my assistance.  I could not convince Meade that anything but the\r\nenemy's horse was fighting us, however, and he declined to push out\r\nthe foot-troops, who were much wearied by night marches.  It has been\r\nascertained since that Meade's conclusions were correct in so far as\r\nthey related to the enemy's infantry; but the five cavalry brigades\r\nfar outnumbered my three, and it is to be regretted that so much was\r\nrisked in holding a point that commanded the roads to Cold Harbor and\r\nMeadow bridge, when there was at hand a preponderating number of\r\nUnion troops which might have been put into action.  However, Gregg's\r\ndivision and Custer's brigade were equal to the situation, all\r\nunaided as they were till dark, when Torbert and Merritt came on the\r\nground.  The contest not only gave us the crossroads, but also\r\nremoved our uncertainty regarding Lee's movements, clearly\r\ndemonstrating that his army was retiring by its right flank, so that\r\nit might continue to interpose between Grant and the James River; as\r\nwell as cover the direct route to Richmond.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee reported this battle to his Government as a Confederate\r\nvictory, but his despatch was sent early in the day, long before the\r\nfight ended, and evidently he could not have known the final result\r\nwhen he made the announcement, for the fight lasted until dark.\r\nAfter dark, our own and the Confederate dead having been buried, I\r\nwithdrew, and moving to the rear of our infantry, marched all night\r\nand till I reached the vicinity of Old Church, where I had been\r\ninstructed to keep a vigilant watch on the enemy with Gregg's and\r\nTorbert's divisions.  As soon as I had taken position at Old Church\r\nmy pickets were pushed out in the direction of Cold Harbor, and the\r\nfact that the enemy was holding that point in some force was clearly\r\nascertained.  But our occupation of Cold Harbor was of the utmost\r\nimportance; indeed, it was absolutely necessary that we should\r\npossess it, to secure our communications with the White House, as\r\nwell as to cover the extension of our line to the left toward the\r\nJames River.  Roads from Bethesda Church, Old Church, and the White\r\nHouse centred at Cold Harbor, and from there many roads diverged also\r\ntoward different crossings of the Chickahominy, which were\r\nindispensable to us.\r\n\r\nThe enemy too realized the importance of the place, for as soon as he\r\nfound himself compelled to take up the line of the Tolopotomy he\r\nthrew a body of troops into Cold Harbor by forced marches, and\r\nfollowed it up by pushing a part of this force out on the Old Church\r\nroad as far as Matadequin Creek, where he established a line of\r\nbattle, arranging the front of it parallel to the road along the\r\nsouth bank of the Pamunkey; this for the purpose of endangering our\r\ntrains as they moved back and forth between the army and the White\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I had occupied Old Church and pushed pickets down toward\r\nCold Harbor.  The outposts struck each other just north of Matadequin\r\nCreek, and a spirited fight immediately took place.  At first our\r\npickets were sorely pressed, but Torbert, who was already preparing\r\nto make a reconnoissance, lost no time in reinforcing them on the\r\nnorth side of the creek with Devin's brigade.  The fight then became\r\ngeneral, both sides, dismounted, stubbornly contesting the ground.\r\nOf the Confederates, General Butler's South Carolinians bore the\r\nbrunt of the fight, and, strongly posted as they were on the south\r\nbank of the creek, held their ground with the same obstinacy they had\r\npreviously shown at Hawe's Shop.  Finally, however, Torbert threw\r\nMerritt's and Custer's brigades into the action, and the enemy\r\nretired, we pursuing to within a mile and a half of Cold Harbor and\r\ncapturing a number of prisoners.  Gregg's division took no part in\r\nthe actual fighting, but remained near Old Church observing the roads\r\non Torberts flanks, one leading toward Bethesda Church on his right,\r\nthe other to his left in the direction of the White House.  This\r\nlatter road Gregg was particularly instructed to keep open, so as to\r\ncommunicate with General W. F. Smith, who was then debarking his\r\ncorps at the White House, and on the morning of the 31st this\r\ngeneral's advance was covered by a brigade which Gregg had sent him\r\nfor the purpose.\r\n\r\nTorbert having pursued toward Cold Harbor the troops he fought at\r\nMatadequin Creek, had taken up a position about a mile and a half\r\nfrom that place, on the Old Church road.  The morning of the 31st I\r\nvisited him to arrange for his further advance, intending thus to\r\nanticipate an expected attack from Fitzhugh Lee, who was being\r\nreinforced by infantry.  I met Torbert at Custer's headquarters, and\r\nfound that the two had already been talking over a scheme to capture\r\nCold Harbor, and when their plan was laid before me it appeared so\r\nplainly feasible that I fully endorsed it, at once giving directions\r\nfor its immediate execution, and ordering Gregg to come forward to\r\nTorbert's support with such troops as he could spare from the duty\r\nwith which he had been charged.\r\n\r\nTorbert moved out promptly, Merritt's brigade first, followed by\r\nCuster's, on the direct road to Cold Harbor, while Devin's brigade\r\nwas detached, and marched by a left-hand road that would bring him in\r\non the right and rear of the enemy's line, which was posted in front\r\nof the crossroads.  Devin was unable to carry his part of the\r\nprogramme farther than to reach the front of the Confederate right,\r\nand as Merritt came into position to the right of the Old Church road\r\nTorbert was obliged to place a part of Custer's brigade on Merritt's\r\nleft so as to connect with Devin.  The whole division was now in\r\nline, confronted by Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry, supported by Clingman's\r\nbrigade from Hoke's division of infantry; and from the Confederate\r\nbreastworks, hastily constructed out of logs, rails, and earth, a\r\nheavy fire was already being poured upon us that it seemed impossible\r\nto withstand.  None of Gregg's division had yet arrived, and so\r\nstubborn was the enemy's resistance that I began to doubt our ability\r\nto carry the place before reinforcements came up, but just then\r\nMerritt reported that he could turn the enemy's left, and being\r\ndirected to execute his proposition, he carried it to a most\r\nsuccessful issue with the First and Second regular cavalry.  Just as\r\nthese two regiments passed around the enemy's left and attacked his\r\nrear, the remainder of the division assailed him in front.  This\r\nmanoeuvre of Merritt's stampeded the Confederates, and the defenses\r\nfalling into our hands easily, we pushed ahead on the Bottom's bridge\r\nroad three-fourths of a mile beyond Cold Harbor.\r\n\r\nCold Harbor was now mine, but I was about nine miles away from our\r\nnearest infantry, and had been able to bring up only Davies's brigade\r\nof cavalry, which arrived after the fight.  My isolated position\r\ntherefore made me a little uneasy.  I felt convinced that the enemy\r\nwould attempt to regain the place, for it was of as much importance\r\nto him as to us, and the presence of his infantry disclosed that he\r\nfully appreciated this.  My uneasiness increased as the day grew\r\nlate, for I had learned from prisoners that the balance of Hoke's\r\ndivision was en route to Cold Harbor, and Kershaw near at hand,\r\ninterposing between the Union left near Bethesda Church and my\r\nposition.  In view of this state of affairs, I notified General Meade\r\nthat I had taken Cold Harbor, but could not with safety to my command\r\nhold it, and forthwith gave directions to withdraw during the night.\r\nThe last of my troops had scarcely pulled out, however, when I\r\nreceived a despatch from Meade directing me to hold Cold Harbor at\r\nevery hazard.  General Grant had expected that a severe battle would\r\nhave to be fought before we could obtain possession of the place; and\r\nits capture by our cavalry not being anticipated, no preparation had\r\nbeen made for its permanent occupancy.  No time was to be lost,\r\ntherefore, if the advantages which possession of Cold Harbor gave us\r\nwere to be improved, so at the same hour that Meade ordered me to\r\nhold the place at all hazards the Sixth Corps was started on a forced\r\nmarch, by Grant's directions, to aid in that object, and on arrival\r\nto relieve my cavalry.\r\n\r\nThe moment Meade's order was received, I directed a reoccupation of\r\nCold Harbor, and although a large portion of Torbert's command was\r\nalready well on its way back to the line we held on the morning of\r\nthe 31st, this force speedily retraced its steps, and re-entered the\r\nplace before daylight; both our departure and return having been\r\neffected without the enemy being aware of our movements.  We now\r\nfound that the temporary breastworks of rails and logs which the\r\nConfederates had built were of incalculable benefit to us in\r\nfurnishing material with which to establish a line of defense, they\r\nbeing made available by simply reversing them at some points, or at\r\nothers wholly reconstructing them to suit the circumstances of the\r\nground: The troops, without reserves, were then placed behind our\r\ncover dismounted, boxes of ammunition distributed along the line, and\r\nthe order passed along that the place must be held.  All this was\r\ndone in the darkness, and while we were working away at our cover the\r\nenemy could be distinctly heard from our skirmish-line giving\r\ncommands and making preparations to attack.\r\n\r\nJust after daylight on the 1st of June the Confederate infantry under\r\nGeneral Kershaw endeavored to drive us out, advancing against my\r\nright from the Bethesda Church road.  In his assault he was permitted\r\nto come close up to our works, and when within short range such afire\r\nwas opened on him from our horse-artillery and repeating carbines\r\nthat he recoiled in confusion after the first onset; still, he seemed\r\ndetermined to get the place, and after reorganizing, again attacked;\r\nbut the lesson of the first repulse was not without effect, and his\r\nfeeble effort proved wholly fruitless.  After his second failure we\r\nwere left undisturbed, and at 9 A.M. I sent the following despatch to\r\narmy headquarters:\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,\r\n\"ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.\r\n\"Cold Harbor, Va., June 1, 1864--9 A.M.\r\n\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL HUMPHREYS,\r\n\"Chief-of-Staff.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL: In obedience to your instructions I am holding Cold Harbor.\r\nI have captured this morning more prisoners; they belong to three\r\ndifferent infantry brigades.  The enemy assaulted the right of my\r\nlines this morning, but were handsomely repulsed.  I have been very\r\napprehensive, but General Wright is now coming up.  I built slight\r\nworks for my men; the enemy came up to them, and were driven back.\r\nGeneral Wright has just arrived.\r\n\r\n\"P. H. SHERIDAN,\r\n\"Major-General Commanding.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout 10 o'clock in the morning the Sixth Corps relieved Torbert and\r\nDavies, having marched all night, and these two generals moving out\r\ntoward the Chickahominy covered the left of the infantry line till\r\nHancock's corps took their place in the afternoon.  By this time\r\nGregg had joined me with his two brigades, and both Torbert and Gregg\r\nwere now marched to Prospect Church, from which point I moved them to\r\na position on the north side of the Chickahominy at Bottom's bridge.\r\nHere the enemy's cavalry confronted us, occupying the south bank of\r\nthe stream, with artillery in position at the fords prepared to\r\ndispute our passage; but it was not intended that we should cross; so\r\nGregg and Torbert lay quiet in camp at Bottom's bridge and at Old\r\nChurch without noteworthy event until the 6th of June.\r\n\r\nAs before related, Wilson's division struck the enemy's infantry as\r\nwell as W. H. F. Lee's cavalry near Ashland on the 1st of June, and\r\nalthough Chapman destroyed the bridges over the South Anna, which was\r\nhis part of the programme, Wilson found it necessary to return to\r\nPrice's Store.  From this point he continued to cover the right of\r\nthe Army of the Potomac, on the 2d of June driving the rear-guard of\r\nthe enemy from Hawe's Shop, the scene of the battle of May 28.  The\r\nsame day he crossed Tolopotomy Creek, and passed around the enemy's\r\nleft flank so far that Lee thought his left was turned by a strong\r\nforce, and under cover of darkness withdrew from a menacing position\r\nwhich he was holding in front of the Ninth Corps.  This successful\r\nmanoeuvre completed, Wilson returned to Hawe's Shop, and on the 4th\r\nwent into camp at New Castle ferry, in anticipation of certain\r\noperations of the Cavalry Corps, which were to take place while the\r\nArmy of the Potomac was crossing to the south side of the James.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVEMENT TO THE JAMES--THE SECOND EXPEDITION--BATTLE OF\r\nTREVILLIAN STATION--DEFEAT OF GENERAL WADE HAMPTON--MALLORY'S\r\nCROSSROADS--SUFFERING OF THE WOUNDED--SECURING THE TRAINS--GENERAL\r\nGREGG'S STUBBORN FIGHT.\r\n\r\nBy the 6th of June General Grant again determined to continue the\r\nmovement of the army by its left flank to the south bank of the James\r\nRiver, his unsuccessful attack on the enemy's works near Cold Harbor\r\nhaving demonstrated that Lee's position north of the Chickahominy\r\ncould not be carried by assault with results that would compensate\r\nfor the enormous loss of life which must follow; therefore a further\r\nattempt to fight a decisive battle north of Richmond was abandoned.\r\nIn carrying the army to the James River the hazardous manoeuvres\r\nwould be hampered by many obstacles, such as the thick timber,\r\nunderbrush, and troublesome swamps to be met in crossing the\r\nChickahominy.  Besides, Lee held an interior line, from which all the\r\ndirect roads to Richmond could be covered with his infantry, leaving\r\nhis cavalry free to confront our advance on the south bank of the\r\nChickahominy as far down as Jones's bridge, and thence around to\r\nCharles City Court House.  In view of these difficulties it became\r\nnecessary to draw off the bulk of the enemy's cavalry while the\r\nmovement to the James was in process of execution, and General Meade\r\ndetermined to do this by requiring me to proceed with two divisions\r\nas far as Charlottesville to destroy the railroad bridge over the\r\nRivanna River near that town, the railroad itself from the Rivanna to\r\nGordonsville, and, if practicable, from Gordonsville back toward\r\nHanover Junction also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,\r\n\"June 5, 1864.  3.30 P. M.\r\n\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN, Commanding Cavalry Corps.\r\n\r\n\"I am directed by the major-general commanding to furnish the\r\nfollowing instructions for your guidance in the execution of the duty\r\nreferred to in the order for movements and changes of position\r\nto-night, a copy of which order accompanies this communication.\r\n\r\n\"With two divisions of your corps you will move on the morning of the\r\n7th instant to Charlottesville and destroy the railroad bridge over\r\nthe Rivanna near that town; you will then thoroughly destroy the\r\nrailroad from that point to Gordonsville, and from Gordonsville\r\ntoward Hanover Junction, and to the latter point, if practicable.\r\nThe chief engineer, Major Duane, will furnish you a canvas\r\npontoon-train of eight boats.  The chief quartermaster will supply you\r\nwith such tools, implements, and materials as you may require for the\r\ndestruction of the road.  Upon the completion of this duty you will\r\nrejoin this army.\r\n\r\n\"A. HUMPHREYS,\r\n\"Major-General, Chief-of-Staff.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Meade's instructions reached me they were somewhat modified by\r\nGeneral Grant, who on the same evening had received information that\r\nGeneral Hunter, commanding the troops in West Virginia, had reached\r\nStaunton and engaged with advantage the Confederate commander,\r\nGeneral Jones, near that place.  General Grant informed me orally\r\nthat he had directed Hunter to advance as far as Charlottesville,\r\nthat he expected me to unite with him there, and that the two\r\ncommands, after destroying the James River canal and the Virginia\r\nCentral road, were to join the Army of the Potomac in the manner\r\ncontemplated in my instructions from General Meade; and that in view\r\nof what was anticipated, it would be well to break up as much of the\r\nrailroad as possible on my way westward.  A copy of his letter to\r\nHunter comprised my written instructions.  A junction with this\r\ngeneral was not contemplated when the expedition was first conceived,\r\nbut became an important though not the paramount object after the\r\nreception of the later information.  The diversion of the enemy's\r\ncavalry from the south side of the Chickahominy was its main purpose,\r\nfor in the presence of such a force as Lee's contracted lines would\r\nnow permit him to concentrate behind the Chickahominy, the\r\ndifficulties of crossing that stream would be largely increased if he\r\nalso had at hand a strong body of horse, to gain the time necessary\r\nfor him to oppose the movement at the different crossings with masses\r\nof his infantry.\r\n\r\nThe order calling for two divisions for the expedition, I decided to\r\ntake Gregg's and Torbert's, leaving Wilson's behind to continue with\r\nthe infantry in its march to the James and to receive instructions\r\ndirectly from, the headquarters of the army.  All my dismounted men\r\nhad been sent to the White House some days before, and they were\r\ndirected to report to Wilson as they could be provided with mounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"COLD HARBOR, VA., June 6, 1964.\r\n\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL D. HUNTER, Commanding Dept West Virginia.\r\n\r\n\"General Sheridan leaves here to-morrow morning with instructions to\r\nproceed to Charlottesville, Va., and to commence there the\r\ndestruction of the Virginia Central railroad, destroying this way as\r\nmuch as possible.  The complete destruction of this road and of the\r\ncanal on James River is of great importance to us.  According to the\r\ninstructions I sent to General Halleck for your guidance, you will\r\nproceed to Lynchburg and commence there.  It would be of great value\r\nto us to get possession of Lynchburg for a single day.  But that\r\npoint is of so much importance to the enemy, that in attempting to\r\nget it such resistance may be met as to defeat your getting into the\r\nroad or canal at all.  I see, in looking over the letter to General\r\nHalleck on the subject of your instructions, that it rather indicates\r\nthat your route should be from Staunton via Charlottesville.  If you\r\nhave so understood it, you will be doing just what I want.  The\r\ndirection I would now give is, that if this letter reaches you in the\r\nvalley between Staunton and Lynchburg, you immediately turn east by\r\nthe most practicable road until you strike the Lynchburg branch of\r\nthe Virginia Central road.  From there move eastward along the line\r\nof the road, destroying it completely and thoroughly, until you join\r\nGeneral Sheridan.  After the work laid out for General Sheridan and\r\nyourself is thoroughly done, proceed to join the Army of the Potomac\r\nby the route laid out in General Sheridan's instructions.  If any\r\nportion of your force, especially your cavalry, is needed back in\r\nyour department, you are authorized to send it back.  If on receipt\r\nof this you should be near to Lynchburg and deem it practicable to\r\nreach that point, you will exercise your judgment about going there.\r\nIf you should be on the railroad between Charlottesville and\r\nLynchburg, it may be practicable to detach a cavalry force to destroy\r\nthe canal.  Lose no opportunity to destroy the canal.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOwing to the hard service of the preceding month we had lost many\r\nhorses, so the number of dismounted men was large; and my strength\r\nhad also been much reduced by killed and wounded during the same\r\nperiod of activity.  The effective mounted force of my two divisions\r\nwas therefore much diminished, they mustering only about six thousand\r\nofficers and men when concentrated on June 6 at New Castle ferry.\r\nHere they were provided with three days' rations, intended to last\r\nfive days, and with two days' grain for the horses.  The rations and\r\nforty rounds of ammunition per man were to be carried on the persons\r\nof the troopers, the grain on the pommel of the saddle, and the\r\nreserve ammunition in wagons.  One medical wagon and eight ambulances\r\nwere also furnished, and one wagon was authorized for each division\r\nand brigade headquarters; enough canvas-covered boats for a small\r\npontoon-bridge were also provided.\r\n\r\nMy instructions permitting latitude in the route I should take, I\r\ndecided to march along the north bank of the North Anna River, cross\r\nthat stream at Carpenter's ford, strike the Virginia Central railroad\r\nat Trevillian Station, destroy it toward Louisa Court House, march\r\npast Gordonsville, strike the railroad again at Cobham's Station, and\r\ndestroy it thence to Charlottesville as we proceeded west.  The\r\nsuccess of the last part of this programme would of course depend on\r\nthe location of General Hunter when I should arrive in the region\r\nwhere it would be practicable for us to communicate with each other.\r\n\r\nFrom my camp at New Castle ferry we crossed the Pamunkey, marched\r\nbetween Aylett's and Dunkirk on the Mattapony River, and on the 8th\r\nof June encamped at Polecat Station.  The next day we resumed the\r\nmarch along the North Anna--our advance guard skirmishing with a few\r\nmounted men of the enemy, who proved to be irregulars--and bivouacked\r\non Northeast Creek, near Young's Mills.  This day I learned from some\r\nof these irregulars whom we made prisoners that Breckenridge's\r\ndivision of infantry, en route to the Shenandoah Valley by way of\r\nGordonsville, was passing slowly up the railroad parallel to me, and\r\nthat the enemy's cavalry had left its position on the south side of\r\nthe Chickahominy, and was marching on the old Richmond and\r\nGordonsville road toward Gordonsville, under command of General Wade\r\nHampton, the information being confirmed by a scouting party sent out\r\nto cut the telegraph wires along the railroad in the night.\r\nBreckenridge had been ordered back to the valley by General Lee as\r\nsoon as he heard of Hunter's victory near Staunton, but now that my\r\nexpedition had been discovered, the movement of Breckenridge's troops\r\non the railroad was being timed to correspond with the marches of my\r\ncommand till Hampton could get more nearly parallel with me.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th we resumed the march, passing by Twyman's store, crossing\r\nthe North Anna at Carpenter's ford and encamping on the road leading\r\nalong the south fork of the North Anna to Trevillian Station.  During\r\nthe evening and night of the 10th the boldness of the enemy's\r\nscouting parties, with which we had been coming into collision more\r\nor less every day, perceptibly increased, thus indicating the\r\npresence of a large force, and evidencing that his shorter line of\r\nmarch had enabled him to bring to my front a strong body of cavalry,\r\nalthough it started from Lee's army nearly two days later than I did\r\nfrom Grant's.  The arrival of this body also permitted Breckenridge\r\nto pass on to Gordonsville, and from there to interpose between\r\nGeneral Hunter and me at either Charlottesville or Waynesboro' as\r\ncircumstances might determine.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the Loth General Hampton's division camped about\r\nthree miles northwest of Trevillian, at a place called Green Spring\r\nValley and Fitzhugh Lee's division not far from Louisa Court House,\r\nsome six miles east of Trevillian.  Learning that I was at\r\nCarpenter's ford, Hampton marched his division by way of Trevillian\r\nStation toward Clayton's store, on the road from Trevillian to\r\nCarpenter's ford, intending to attack me at Clayton's.  Fitzhugh\r\nLee's division was to join Hampton at Clayton's store from Louisa\r\nCourt House; but on the morning of the 11th the two generals were\r\nseparated by several miles.\r\n\r\nAt daylight of the 11th my march, to Trevillian Station was resumed\r\non the direct road to that point, and engaging the enemy's pickets\r\nand advanced parties soon after setting out, we began to drive them\r\nin.  Torbert had the lead with Merritt's and Devin's brigades, and as\r\nhe pressed back the pickets he came upon the enemy posted behind a\r\nline of barricades in dense timber about three miles from Trevillian.\r\nMeanwhile Custer's brigade had been sent from where we bivouacked, by\r\na wood road found on our left, to destroy Trevillian Station.  In\r\nfollowing this road Custer got to the rear of Hampton's division,\r\nhaving passed between its right flank and Fitzhugh Lee's division,\r\nwhich was at the time marching on the road leading from Louisa Court\r\nHouse to Clayton's store to unite with Hampton.\r\n\r\nCuster, the moment he found himself in Hampton's rear, charged the\r\nled horses, wagons, and caissons found there, getting hold of a vast\r\nnumber of each, and also of the station itself.  The stampede and\r\nhavoc wrought by Custer in Hampton's rear compelled him to turn\r\nRosser's brigade in that direction, and while it attacked Custer on\r\none side, Fitzhugh Lee's division, which had followed Custer toward\r\nTrevillian, attacked him on the other.  There then ensued a desperate\r\nstruggle for the possession of the captured property, resulting\r\nfinally in its being retaken by the enemy.  Indeed, the great number\r\nof horses and vehicles could not be kept on the limited space within\r\nCuster's line, which now formed almost a complete circle; and while\r\nhe was endeavoring to remove them to a secure place they, together\r\nwith Custer's headquarters wagon and four of his caissons, fell into\r\nthe hands of their original owners.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the firing told that Custer had struck the enemy's rear, I\r\ndirected Torbert to press the line in front of Merritt and Devin,\r\naided by one brigade of Gregg's division on their left, Gregg's other\r\nbrigade in the meantime attacking Fitzhugh Lee on the Louisa Court\r\nHouse road.  The effect of this was to force Hampton back, and his\r\ndivision was so hard pushed that a portion of it was driven pell-mell\r\ninto Custer's lines, leaving there about five hundred prisoners.  The\r\nrest of Hampton's men did not rally till they got some distance west\r\nof Trevillian, while, in the meantime, Gregg had driven Fitzhugh Lee\r\ntoward Louisa Court House so far that many miles now intervened\r\nbetween the two Confederate divisions, precluding their union until\r\nabout noon the next day, when Fitzhugh Lee effected the junction\r\nafter a circuitous march in the night.  The defeat of Hampton at the\r\npoint where he had determined to resist my further advance, and his\r\nretreat westward, gave me undisturbed possession of the station; and\r\nafter destroying the railroad to some extent toward Gordonsville, I\r\nwent into camp.\r\n\r\nFrom prisoners taken during the day, I gathered that General Hunter,\r\ninstead of coming toward Charlottesville, as I had reason to expect,\r\nboth from the instructions given me and the directions sent him by\r\nGeneral Grant, was in the neighborhood of Lexington--apparently\r\nmoving on Lynchburg--and that Breckenridge was at Gordonsville and\r\nCharlottesville.  I also heard, from the same source, that Ewell's\r\ncorps was on its way to Lynchburg, but this intelligence proved\r\nafterward to be incorrect, for these troops, commanded by General\r\nEarly, did not leave Richmond till two days later.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt as to the information about Hunter's general\r\nlocation, however.  He was marching toward Lynchburg, away from\r\ninstead of toward me, thus making the junction of our commands beyond\r\nall reasonable probability.  So in view of this, I made up my mind to\r\nabandon that part of the scheme, and to return by leisurely marches,\r\nwhich would keep Hampton's cavalry away from Lee while Grant was\r\ncrossing the James River.  I was still further influenced to this\r\ncourse by the burden which was thrown on me in the large number of\r\nwounded--there being about five hundred cases of my own--and the five\r\nhundred prisoners that I would probably be forced to abandon, should\r\nI proceed farther.  Besides, the recent battle had reduced my supply\r\nof ammunition to a very small amount--not more than enough for one\r\nmore respectable engagement; and as the chances were that I would\r\nhave to fight a great deal before I could reach Hunter, now that the\r\nenemy's cavalry and Breckenridge's infantry were between us, the\r\nrisks of the undertaking seemed too great to warrant it.\r\n\r\nThe morning of June 12 Gregg's division commenced destroying the\r\nrailroad to Louisa Court House, and continued the work during the\r\nday, breaking it pretty effectually.  While Gregg was thus occupied,\r\nI directed Torbert to make a reconnoissance up the Gordonsville road,\r\nto secure a by-road leading over Mallory's ford, on the North Anna,\r\nto the Catharpen road, as I purposed following that route to\r\nSpottsylvania Court House on my return, and thence via Bowling Green\r\nand Dunkirk to the White House.  About a mile beyond Trevillian the\r\nGordonsville road fork--the left fork leading to Charlottesville--and\r\nabout a mile beyond the fork Hampton had taken up and strongly\r\nintrenched a line across both roads, being reinforced by Fitzhugh\r\nLee, who, as before related, had joined him about noon by a\r\nroundabout march.  Torbert soon hotly engaged this line, and by the\r\nimpetuosity of his first attack, gained some advantage; but the\r\nappearance of Fitzhugh Lee's troops on the right, and Hampton's\r\nstrong resistance in front, rendered futile all efforts to carry the\r\nposition; and, although I brought up one of Gregg's brigades to\r\nTorbert's assistance, yet the by-road I coveted was still held by the\r\nenemy when night closed in.\r\n\r\nThis engagement, like that off the day before around Trevillian, was\r\nmostly fought dismounted by both sides, as had also been the earlier\r\nfights of the cavalry during the summer in the Wilderness, at Todd's\r\nTavern, Hawe's Shop, and Matadequin Creek.  Indeed, they could hardly\r\nhave been fought otherwise than on foot, as there was little chance\r\nfor mounted fighting in eastern Virginia, the dense woods, the\r\narmament of both parties, and the practice of barricading making it\r\nimpracticable to use the sabre with anything like a large force; and\r\nso with the exception of Yellow Tavern the dismounted method\r\nprevailed in almost every engagement.\r\n\r\nThe losses at Mallory's Crossroads were very heavy on both sides.\r\nThe character of the fighting, together with the day's results,\r\ndemonstrated that it was impossible to make the passage of the North\r\nAnna at Mallory's ford without venturing another battle the next day.\r\nThis would consume the little ammunition left, and though we might\r\ngain the road, yet the possibility of having no ammunition whatever\r\nto get back with was too great a hazard, so I gave orders to withdraw\r\nduring the night of the 12th.  We retired along the same road by\r\nwhich we had come, taking with us the prisoners, and all of our\r\nwounded who could be moved.  Those who could not be transported, some\r\nninety in number, and all the Confederate wounded in my hands, were\r\nleft at Trevillian in hospitals, under charge of one of our surgeons,\r\nwith plenty of medical and other stores.\r\n\r\nWe recrossed the North Anna at Carpenter's ford the following\r\nmorning, and halting there, unsaddled and turned the horses out to\r\ngraze, for they were nearly famished, having had neither food nor\r\nwater during the preceding forty-eight hours.  Late in the afternoon\r\nwe saddled up and proceeded to Twyman's Store, while General\r\nHampton's main body moved down the south bank of the North Anna, with\r\nthe purpose of intervening between me and the Army of the Potomac, in\r\nthe hope of preventing my return to it; but his movements took no\r\ndefinite shape beyond watching me, however, till several days later,\r\nnear St. Mary's Church, when I was crossing the peninsula to the\r\nJames River.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th the march was continued, and we reached the Catharpen\r\nroad, upon which it was originally intended to move if we had been\r\nable to cross at Mallory's ford, and this conducted me to Shady Grove\r\nChurch.  The next day we passed over the battle-field of\r\nSpottsylvania Court House.  The marks of the recent conflicts about\r\nthere were visible on every hand, and in the neighboring houses were\r\nfound many Union and Confederate wounded, who had been too severely\r\nhurt to be removed from the field-hospitals at the time of the\r\nbattles.  Such of our wounded as were able to travel were brought\r\naway.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th I marched from Edge Hill on the Ta River through Bowling\r\nGreen to Dr. Butler's, on the north side of the Mattapony.  When I\r\narrived here I was unable to ascertain the position of the Army of\r\nthe Potomac, and was uncertain whether or not the base at the White\r\nHouse had been discontinued.  I had heard nothing from the army for\r\nnine days except rumors through Southern sources, and under these\r\ncircumstances did not like to venture between the Mattapony and\r\nPamunkey rivers, embarrassed as I was with some four hundred wounded,\r\nfive hundred prisoners, and about two thousand negroes that had\r\njoined my column in the hope of obtaining their freedom.  I therefore\r\ndetermined to push down the north bank of the Mattapony far enough to\r\nenable me to send these impediments directly to West Point, where I\r\nanticipated finding some of our gunboats and transports, that could\r\ncarry all to the North.  Following this plan, we proceeded through\r\nWalkerton to King and Queen Court House, and bivouacked in its\r\nvicinity the night of the 18th.  Next day I learned that the depot at\r\nthe White House had not yet been broken up entirely, and that\r\nsupplies were in store for me there; so after sending the wounded,\r\nprisoners, and negroes to West Point under an escort of two\r\nregiments, I turned back to Dunkirk, on the Mattapony, and crossed to\r\nthe south side at a place where the stream was narrow enough to\r\nbridge with my pontoon-boats.\r\n\r\nIn returning from Trevillian, as the most of our wounded were hauled\r\nin old buggies, carts, and such other vehicles as could be made\r\navailable in the absence of a sufficient number of ambulances, the\r\nsuffering was intense, the heat of the season and dusty roads adding\r\nmuch to the discomfort.  Each day we halted many times to dress the\r\nwounds of the injured and to refresh them as much as possible, but\r\nour means for mitigating their distress were limited.  The fortitude\r\nand cheerfulness of the poor fellows under such conditions were\r\nremarkable, for no word of complaint was heard.  The Confederate\r\nprisoners and colored people being on foot, our marches were\r\nnecessarily made short, and with frequent halts also, but they too\r\nsuffered considerably from the heat and dust, though at times the\r\nprisoners were relieved by being mounted on the horses of some of our\r\nregiments, the owners meantime marching on foot.  Where all the\r\ncolored people came from and what started them was inexplicable, but\r\nthey began joining us just before we reached Trevillian--men, women,\r\nand children with bundles of all sorts containing their few worldly\r\ngoods, and the number increased from day to day until they arrived at\r\nWest Point.  Probably not one of the poor things had the remotest\r\nidea, when he set out, as to where he would finally land, but to a\r\nman they followed the Yankees in full faith that they would lead to\r\nfreedom, no matter what road they took.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 20th, at an early hour, we resumed our march,\r\nand as the column proceeded sounds of artillery were heard in the\r\ndirection of the White House, which fact caused us to quicken the\r\npace.  We had not gone far when despatches from General Abercrombie,\r\ncommanding some fragmentary organizations at the White House,\r\nnotified me that the place was about to be attacked.  I had\r\npreviously sent an advance party with orders to move swiftly toward\r\nthe cannonading and report to me by couriers the actual condition of\r\naffairs.  From this party I soon learned that there was no occasion\r\nto push our jaded animals, since the crisis, if there had been one,\r\nwas over and the enemy repulsed, so the increased gait was reduced to\r\na leisurely march that took us late in the afternoon to the north\r\nbank of the Pamunkey, opposite Abercrombie's camp.  When I got to the\r\nriver the enemy was holding the bluffs surrounding the White House\r\nfarm, having made no effort to penetrate General Abercrombie's line\r\nor do him other hurt than to throw a few shells among the teamsters\r\nthere congregated.\r\n\r\nNext day Gregg's division crossed the Pamunkey dismounted, and\r\nTorbert's crossed mounted. As soon as the troops were over, Gregg,\r\nsupported by Merritt's brigade, moved out on the road to Tunstall's\r\nStation to attack Hampton, posted an the west side of Black Creek,\r\nCuster's brigade meanwhile moving, mounted, on the road to\r\nCumberland, and Devin's in like manner on the one to Baltimore\r\ncrossroads.  This offer of battle was not accepted, however, and\r\nHampton withdrew from my front, retiring behind the Chickahominy,\r\nwhere his communications with Lee would be more secure.\r\n\r\nWhile at the White House I received orders to break up that depot\r\nwholly, and also instructions to move the trains which the Army of\r\nthe Potomac had left there across the peninsula to the pontoon-bridge\r\nat Deep Bottom on the James River.  These trains amounted to hundreds\r\nof wagons and other vehicles, and knowing full well the dangers which\r\nwould attend the difficult problem of getting them over to\r\nPetersburg, I decided to start them with as little delay as\r\ncircumstances would permit, and the morning of the 22d sent Torbert's\r\ndivision ahead to secure Jones's bridge on the Chickahominy, so that\r\nthe wagons could be crossed at that point.  The trains followed\r\nTorbert, while Gregg's division marched by a road parallel to the one\r\non which the wagons were moving, and on their right flank, as they\r\nneeded to be covered and protected in that direction only.\r\n\r\nThe enemy made no effort to attack us while we were moving the trains\r\nthat day, and the wagons were all safely parked for the night on the\r\nsouth side of the Chickahominy, guarded by General Getty, who had\r\nrelieved Abercrombie from command of the infantry fragments before we\r\nstarted off from the White House.\r\n\r\nTo secure the crossing at Jones's bridge, Torbert had pushed Devin's\r\nbrigade out on the Long Bridge road, on the side of the Chickahominy\r\nwhere, on the morning of the 23d, he was attacked by Chambliss's\r\nbrigade of W. H. F. Lee's division.  Devin was driven in some little\r\ndistance, but being reinforced by Getty with six companies of colored\r\ntroops, he quickly turned the tables on Chambliss and re-established\r\nhis picket-posts.  From this affair I learned that Chambliss's brigade\r\nwas the advance of the Confederate cavalry corps, while Hampton\r\ndiscovered from it that we were already in possession of the Jones's\r\nbridge crossing of the Chickahominy; and as he was too late to\r\nchallenge our passage of the stream at this point he contented\r\nhimself with taking up a position that night so as to cover the roads\r\nleading from Long Bridge to Westover, with the purpose of preventing\r\nthe trains from following the river road to the pontoon-bridge at\r\nDeep Bottom.\r\n\r\nMy instructions required me to cross the trains over the James River\r\non this pontoon-bridge if practicable, and to reach it I should be\r\nobliged to march through Charles City Court House, and then by\r\nHarrison's Landing and Malvern Hill, the latter point being held by\r\nthe enemy.  In fact, he held all the ground between Long Bridge on\r\nthe Chickahominy and the pontoon-bridge except the Tete de pont at\r\nthe crossing.  Notwithstanding this I concluded to make the attempt,\r\nfor all the delays of ferrying the command and trains would be\r\navoided if we got through to the bridge; and with this object in view\r\nI moved Torbert's division out on the Charles City road to conduct\r\nthe wagons.  Just beyond Charles City Court House Torbert encountered\r\nLomax's brigade, which he drove across Herring Creek on the road to\r\nWestover Church; and reporting the affair to me, I surmised, from the\r\npresence of this force in my front, that Hampton would endeavor to\r\npenetrate to the long column of wagons, so I ordered them to go into\r\npark near Wilcox's landing, and instructed Gregg, whose division had\r\nbeen marching in the morning along the road leading from Jones's\r\nbridge to St.  Mary's Church for the purpose of covering the exposed\r\nflank of the train, to hold fast near the church without fail till\r\nall the transportation had passed Charles City Court House.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, General Hampton, who had conjectured that I would try to\r\nget the train across the James by the pontoon-bridge at Deep Bottom,\r\nbegan concentrating all his troops except Lomax's brigade, which was\r\nto confront the head of my column on the river road, in the vicinity\r\nof Nance's Shop.  This was discovered by Gregg at an early hour, and\r\ndivining this purpose he had prepared to meet it by constructing\r\nhasty cover for his men before receiving my instructions.  About 4\r\no'clock in the afternoon Hampton got his force in hand, and with\r\nFitzhugh Lee's division assailed the whole front of Gregg's line, and\r\nhis left flank with Chambliss's and Geary's brigades.  For two hours\r\nhe continued to attack, but made little impression on Gregg--gain at\r\none point being counterbalanced by failure at another.  Because of\r\nthe evident strength of Hampton, Gregg had placed all his troops in\r\nline of battle from the first, and on discovery of the enemy's\r\nsuperior numbers sent message after message to me concerning the\r\nsituation, but the messengers never arrived, being either killed or\r\ncaptured, and I remained in total ignorance till dark of the strait\r\nhis division was in.\r\n\r\nToward night it became clear to Gregg that he could maintain the\r\nunequal contest no longer, and he then decided to retreat, but not\r\nuntil convinced that the time won had enabled all the trains to pass\r\nCharles City Court House in safety.  When he had got all his led\r\nhorses fairly on the way, and such of the wounded as could be\r\ntransported, he retired by his right flank-in some confusion, it is\r\ntrue, but stubbornly resisting to Hopewell Church, where Hampton\r\nceased to press him.\r\n\r\nGregg's losses were heavy, and he was forced to abandon his dead and\r\nmost seriously wounded, but the creditable stand made ensured the\r\nsafety of the train, the last wagon of which was now parked at\r\nWilcox's Landing.  His steady, unflinching determination to gain time\r\nfor the wagons to get beyond the point of danger was characteristic\r\nof the man, and this was the third occasion on which he had exhibited\r\na high order of capacity and sound judgment since coming under my\r\ncommand.  The firmness and coolness with which he always met the\r\nresponsibilities of a dangerous place were particularly strong points\r\nin Gregg's make-up, and he possessed so much professional though\r\nunpretentious ability, that it is to be regretted he felt obliged a\r\nfew months later to quit the service before the close of the war.\r\n\r\nGregg's fight fully satisfied me that we could not get the trains up\r\nto the pontoon-bridge, for of course Hampton would now throw all his\r\ncavalry in my front, on the river road, where it could be backed up\r\nby Lee's infantry.  Meanwhile, General Meade had become assured of\r\nthe same thing, and as he was now growing anxious about the fate of\r\nWilson's division--which, during my absence, had been sent out to\r\nbreak the enemy's communications south of Petersburg, by destroying\r\nthe Southside and Danville railroads--he sent ferryboats to cross me\r\nover the James.  During the night of the 24th, and next morning, the\r\nimmense train--which ought never to have been left for the cavalry to\r\nescort, after a fatiguing expedition of three weeks--was moved back\r\nthrough Charles City Court House to Douthard's landing, and there\r\nferried over the river, followed by my troops in like manner.  When\r\nGeneral Hampton discovered this, he moved to Drury's Bluff, and\r\nthere, on the morning of the 27th, crossed the James by the\r\nConfederate pontoon-bridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nGENERAL WILSON'S RAID--DESTROYING RAILROADS--HIS DISCOMFITURE\r\n--RESULTS OF HIS RAID--REMOUNTS--MOVEMENT TO THE NORTH SIDE OF THE\r\nJAMES--DECEIVING LEE--MY ISOLATED POSITION--ESTIMATE OF HANCOCK\r\n--SUCCESS OF THE CAVALRY--THEIR CONSTANT DUTIES.\r\n\r\nWhile I was absent on the expedition to Trevillian, the movement of\r\nthe Army of the Potomac across the James River was effected, and\r\nWilson, whom I had left behind for the purpose, was engaged in the\r\nduty of covering its front and rear.  Late on the night of June 12\r\nhe, with Chapman's brigade, crossed the Chickahominy at Long Bridge,\r\nin advance of the Fifth Corps, and by 7 o'clock next morning had\r\ndriven the enemy's pickets up to White Oak bridge, where he waited\r\nfor our infantry.  When that came up, he pushed on as far as Riddle's\r\nShop, but late that evening the Confederate infantry forced him to\r\nwithdraw to St. Mary's Church; for early in the morning General Lee\r\nhad discovered the movement of our army, and promptly threw this\r\ncolumn of infantry south of the Chickahominy to White Oak Swamp, with\r\nthe design of covering Richmond.  From St. Mary's Church Wilson\r\nguarded all the roads toward White Oak Swamp and Riddle's Shop,\r\nMcIntosh's brigade joining him on the 14th, by way of Long Bridge, as\r\nthe rear of the Army of the Potomac passed the Chickahominy.  In the\r\nperformance of this duty Wilson did not have to fight any engagement\r\nof magnitude, for the bulk of the enemy's cavalry had followed me to\r\nTrevillian.  During the 15th and 16th Wilson drew his troops in\r\ntoward the James River, and next day crossed it on the pontoon-bridge\r\nand camped on the Blackwater, near Mt. Sinai Church.  Here he\r\nremained till the 22d of June--the same day I reached the White House\r\nwith Gregg and Torbert--when, under orders from General Meade, he set\r\nout to cut the enemy's communications to the south and southwest of\r\nPetersburg.\r\n\r\nHis instructions implied that the breaking up of the Petersburg and\r\nLynchburg, and Richmond and Danville railroads at Burkeville was the\r\nmost important part of his mission, and that when the work of\r\ndestruction began, it should be continued till he was driven off by\r\nthe enemy.  Wilson's force consisted of about 5,500 men, General A.\r\nV. Kautz, with the cavalry of the Army of the James, having joined\r\nhim for the expedition.  In moving out Wilson crossed the Weldon road\r\nnear Ream's Station, first destroying it effectually at that point.\r\nAbout fourteen miles west of Petersburg he struck the Southside\r\nrailroad, and broke it up clear to Burkeville, a distance of thirty\r\nmiles.  Having destroyed everything at Burkeville Junction, he moved\r\nalong the Danville road to Staunton River, completely wrecking about\r\nthirty miles of that line also.  At Staunton River he found the\r\nrailroad bridge strongly guarded, and seeing that he could not burn\r\nit, he began his return march that night, and reached Nottoway River,\r\nsome thirty miles south of Petersburg, at noon of the next day--the\r\n28th.\r\n\r\nIn this expedition Wilson was closely followed from the start by\r\nBarringer's brigade of W. H. F. Lee's cavalry, but the operations\r\nwere not interfered with materially, his success being signal till he\r\nreached the vicinity of Stony Creek depot on his return.  At this\r\npoint General Hampton, with his own and Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry, got\r\nbetween Wilson and the Army of the Potomac, there being behind them\r\nat Ream's Station, at the same time, two brigades of infantry under\r\nGeneral Mahone.  A severe battle ensued, resulting in Wilson's\r\ndefeat, with the loss of twelve guns and all his wagons.  In\r\nconsequence of this discomfiture he was obliged to fall back across\r\nthe Nottoway River with his own division, and rejoined the army by\r\nway of Peter's bridge on that stream, while Kautz's division, unable\r\nto unite with Wilson after the two commands had become separated in\r\nthe fight, made a circuit of the enemy's left, and reached the lines\r\nof our army in the night of the 28th.\r\n\r\nNeither the presence of Hampton's cavalry at Stony Creek depot, nor\r\nthe possession of Ream's Station by the Confederate infantry, seems\r\nto have been anticipated by Wilson, for in the report of the\r\nexpedition he states:\r\n\r\n\"Foreseeing the probability of having to return northward, I wrote to\r\nGeneral Meade the evening before starting that I anticipated no\r\nserious difficulty in executing his orders; but unless General\r\nSheridan was required to keep Hampton's cavalry engaged, and our\r\ninfantry to prevent Lee from making detachments, we should probably\r\nexperience great difficulty in rejoining the army.  In reply to this\r\nnote, General Humphreys, chief-of-staff, informed me it was intended\r\nthe Army of the Potomac should cover the Weldon road the next day,\r\nthe Southside road the day after, and that Hampton having followed\r\nSheridan toward Gordonsville, I need not fear any trouble from him.\"\r\n\r\nI doubt that General Meade's letter of instructions and Wilson's note\r\nof the same evening, warrant what General Wilson here says.  It is\r\ntrue that the Weldon railroad near Ream's Station was not covered by\r\nour infantry, as General Humphreys informed him it would be, but\r\nWilson is in error when he intimates that he was assured that I would\r\nlook after Hampton.  I do not think General Meade's instructions are\r\nsusceptible of this interpretation.  I received no orders requiring\r\nme to detain Hampton.  On the contrary, when I arrived at the White\r\nHouse my instructions required me to break up the depot there, and\r\nthen bring the train across the Peninsula as soon as practicable, nor\r\nwere these instructions ever modified.  I began the duty imposed on\r\nme on the morning of the 23d, totally in the dark as to what was\r\nexpected of Wilson, though it seems, from some correspondence between\r\nGenerals Grant and Meade, which I never saw till after the war, that\r\nGrant thought Wilson could rely on Hampton's absence from his field\r\nof operations throughout the expedition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,\r\n\"June 21, 1864. 9:20 A.

M. to-morrow, the 22d instant, in execution of the duty assigned\r\nyou of destroying certain railroads.  Despatches received from the\r\nWhite House state that Hampton's cavalry was before that place\r\nyesterday evening, and that General Sheridan had also reached there,\r\nhence it is desirable that you should march at the earliest moment.\r\nIn passing Petersburg you will endeavor to avoid the observation of\r\nthe enemy, and then move by the shortest routes to the intersection\r\nof the Petersburg and Lynchburg, and the Richmond and Danville\r\nrailroads, and destroy both these roads to the greatest extent\r\npossible, continuing their destruction until driven from it by such\r\nattacks of the enemy as you can no longer resist.  The destruction of\r\nthose roads to such an extent that they cannot be used by the enemy\r\nin connection with Richmond during the remainder of the campaign is\r\nan important part of the plan of campaign.  The latest information\r\nfrom Major-General Hunter represents him to be a few miles west of\r\nLynchburg.  He may endeavor to form a junction with this army; you\r\nwill communicate with him if practicable, and have delivered to him\r\nverbally the contents of the following copy of a communication from\r\nLieutenant-General Grant to the major-general commanding this army.\r\nLieutenant Brooks, who will accompany your expedition part of the\r\nway, should be informed where General Hunter will probably be found.\r\n\r\n\"The success of your expedition will depend upon the secrecy with\r\nwhich it is commenced, and the celerity with which its movements are\r\nconducted; your command will, therefore, have with it the lightest\r\nsupplies and smallest number of wheels consistent with the thorough\r\nexecution of the duty, the supplies of the section of country you\r\nwill operate in being taken into account.  Upon the completion of the\r\nwork assigned you, you will rejoin this army.\r\n\r\n\"The chief quartermaster was directed yesterday to supply you with\r\nthe implements and material for the destruction of railroads obtained\r\nfor General Sheridan.\r\n\r\n\"[Signed] \"A.

I shall march in obedience thereto at 2 A. M. to-morrow.\r\nBefore starting I would like to know if our infantry forces cover the\r\nWeldon road.\r\n\r\n\"I propose striking the Southside road first at Sutherland Station,\r\nor some point in that vicinity, tearing up the track sufficiently to\r\ndelay railroad communication ten or twelve hours.  At this place I\r\nshall detach a force to strike the Richmond and Danville road, by a\r\nrapid march, at the nearest point, tearing up the track at every\r\npracticable point between there and Burkeville.\r\n\r\n\"From Sutherlands I shall move the main body of my command by the\r\nGreat road (breaking the railroad at every convenient point) directly\r\nto Burkeville, which, if we succeed in capturing, will afford us the\r\nopportunity of prosecuting our work with great advantage.  As soon as\r\nI have made dispositions for communicating with Hunter and done all\r\nthe damage possible, I shall move with all possible rapidity for\r\nDanville and Grenboro'.\r\n\r\n\"Circumstances must, however, is a great degree control our movements\r\nafter leaving Burkeville.\r\n\r\n\"If Sheridan will look after Hampton, I apprehend no difficulty, and\r\nhope to be able to do the enemy great damage.  The ammunition issued\r\nto my command is very defective.  The implements for destroying roads\r\nhave not yet arrived, but I learn from General Ingalls that they will\r\ncertainly be here early to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\"[Signed] J. H. WILSON,\r\n\"Brigadier-General Commanding.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moment I received orders from General Meade to go to the relief\r\nof Wilson, I hastened with Torbert and Gregg by way of Prince George\r\nCourt House and Lee's Mills to Ream's Station.  Here I found the\r\nSixth Corps, which Meade had pushed out on his left flank immediately\r\non hearing of Wilson's mishap, but I was too late to render any\r\nmaterial assistance, Wilson having already disappeared, followed by\r\nthe enemy.  However, I at once sent out parties to gather\r\ninformation, and soon learned that Wilson had got safe across the\r\nNottoway at Peter's bridge and was making for the army by way of\r\nBlunt's bridge, on the Blackwater.\r\n\r\nThe benefits derived from this expedition, in the destruction of the\r\nSouthside and Danville railroads, were considered by General Grant as\r\nequivalent for the losses sustained in Wilson's defeat, for the\r\nwrecking of the railroads and cars was most complete, occasioning at\r\nthis, time serious embarrassment to the Confederate Government; but I\r\ndoubt if all this compensated for the artillery and prisoners that\r\nfell into the hands of the enemy in the swamps of Hatcher's Run and\r\nRowanty Creek.  Wilson's retreat from the perilous situation at\r\nReam's station was a most creditable performance--in the face of two\r\nbrigades of infantry and three divisions of cavalry--and in the\r\nconduct of the whole expedition the only criticism that can hold\r\nagainst him is that he placed too much reliance on meeting our\r\ninfantry at Ream's station, seeing that uncontrollable circumstances\r\nmight, and did, prevent its being there.  He ought to have marched on\r\nthe 28th by Jarrett's Station to Peter's bridge, on the Nottoway, and\r\nBlunts bridge on the Blackwater, to the rear of the Army of the\r\nPotomac.\r\n\r\nWhen the safety of Wilson's command was assured, I was ordered back\r\nto Light House Point, where I had gone into camp after crossing the\r\nJames River to rest and recruit my command, now very much reduced in\r\nnumbers by reason of casualties to both horses and men.  It had been\r\nmarching and fighting for fifty consecutive days, and the fatiguing\r\nservice had told so fearfully on my animals that the number of\r\ndismounted men in the corps was very large.  With the exception of\r\nabout four hundred horses that I received at the White House, no\r\nanimals were furnished to supply the deficiencies which had arisen\r\nfrom the wearing marches of the past two months until I got to this\r\ncamp at Light House Point; here my needs were so obvious that they\r\ncould no longer be neglected.\r\n\r\nI remained at Light House Point from the 2d to the 26th of July,\r\nrecuperating the cavalry, the intensely warm weather necessitating\r\nalmost an entire suspension of hostilities on the part of the Army of\r\nthe Potomac.  Meanwhile fifteen hundred horses were sent me here, and\r\nthese, with the four hundred already mentioned, were all that my\r\ntroops received while I held the personal command of the Cavalry\r\nCorps, from April 6 to August 1, 1864.  This was not near enough to\r\nmount the whole command, so I disposed the men who could not be\r\nsupplied in a dismounted camp.\r\n\r\nBy the 26th of July our strength was pretty well restored, and as\r\nGeneral Grant was now contemplating offensive operations for the\r\npurpose of keeping Lee's army occupied around Richmond, and also of\r\ncarrying Petersburg by assault if possible, I was directed to move to\r\nthe north side of the James River in conjunction with General\r\nHancock's corps, and, if opportunity offered, to make a second\r\nexpedition against the Virginia Central railroad, and again destroy\r\nthe bridges on the North Anna, the Little and the South Anna rivers.\r\n\r\nI started out on the afternoon of the 26th and crossed the Appomattox\r\nat Broadway landing.  At Deep Bottom I was joined by Kautz's small\r\ndivision from the Army of the James, and here massed the whole\r\ncommand, to allow Hancock's corps to take the lead, it crossing to\r\nthe north bank of the James River by the bridge below the mouth of\r\nBailey's Creek.  I moved late in the afternoon, so as not to come\r\nwithin the enemy's view before dark, and after night-fall Hancock's\r\ncorps passed me and began crossing the pontoon-bridge about 2 o'clock\r\nin the morning.\r\n\r\nBy daylight Hancock was across, the cavalry following.  Soon a\r\nportion of his corps attacked the enemy's works on the east side of\r\nBailey's Creek, and, aided by the cavalry moving on its right,\r\ncaptured four pieces of artillery.  This opened the way for Hancock\r\nto push out his whole corps, and as he advanced by a wheel, with his\r\nleft as a pivot, the cavalry joined in the movement, pressing forward\r\non the New Market and Central or Charles City roads.\r\n\r\nWe did not go far before we found the enemy's infantry posted across\r\nthese two roads behind a strong line of intrenchments on the west\r\nbank of Bailey's Creek.  His videttes in front of Ruffin's house on\r\nthe New Market road were soon driven in on their main line, and the\r\nhigh ground before the house was immediately occupied by Torbert and\r\nGregg, supported by Kautz's division.  By the time the cavalry line\r\nwas formed the Confederate General Kershaw, with his own division of\r\ninfantry and those of Wilcox and Heath, advanced to attack us.\r\nDirecting the most of his troops against the cavalry, which was still\r\nmounted, Kershaw drove it back some distance over the high ground.\r\nWhen it reached the eastern face of the ridge, however, it was\r\nquickly dismounted, and the men directed to lie down in line of\r\nbattle about fifteen yards from the crest, and here the onset of the\r\nenemy was awaited.  When Kershaw's men reached the crest such a\r\nsevere fire was opened on them, and at such close quarters, that they\r\ncould not withstand it, and gave way in disorder.  They were followed\r\nacross the plain by the cavalry, and lost about two hundred and fifty\r\nprisoners and two battle-flags.  The counter attack against the\r\ninfantry by Torbert and Gregg re-established our line and gave us the\r\nvictory of Darbytown, but it also demonstrated the fact that General\r\nLee had anticipated the movement around his left flank by\r\ntransferring to the north side of the James a large portion of his\r\ninfantry and W. H. F. Lee's division of cavalry.\r\n\r\nThis development rendered useless any further effort on Hancock's\r\npart or mine to carry out the plan of the expedition, for General\r\nGrant did not intend Hancock to assault the enemy's works unless\r\nthere should be found in them but a very thin line of infantry which\r\ncould be surprised.  In such event, Hancock was to operate so that\r\nthe cavalry might turn the Confederates on the Central or Charles\r\nCity road, but the continually increasing force of the enemy showed\r\nthis to be impracticable.  The long front presented by Hancock's\r\ncorps and the cavalry deceived General Lee, and he undoubtedly\r\nthought that nearly all of Grant's army had been moved to the north\r\nside of the James River; and to meet the danger he transferred the\r\nmost of his own strength to the same side to confront his adversary,\r\nthinning the lines around Petersburg to reinforce those opposing us\r\non the Central and New Market roads.  This was what Grant hoped Lee\r\nwould do in case the operations of Hancock and myself became\r\nimpracticable, for Grant had an alternative plan for carrying\r\nPetersburg by assault in conjunction with the explosion of a mine\r\nthat had been driven under the enemy's works from the front of\r\nBurnside's corps.\r\n\r\nNow that there was no longer a chance for the cavalry to turn the\r\nenemy's left, our attention was directed to keeping up the deception\r\nof Lee, and on the afternoon of the 28th Hancock's corps withdrew to\r\na line nearer the head of the bridge, the cavalry drawing back to a\r\nposition on his right.  From now on, all sorts of devices and\r\nstratagems were practiced--anything that would tend to make the\r\nConfederates believe we were being reinforced, while Hancock was\r\npreparing for a rapid return to Petersburg at the proper time.  In\r\norder to delude the enemy still more after night-fall of the 28th I\r\nsent one of my divisions to the south side of the James, first\r\ncovering the bridgeway with refuse hay to keep the tramp of the horses\r\nfrom being heard.  After daylight the next morning, I marched this\r\ndivision back again on foot, in full view of the enemy, to create the\r\nimpression of a continuous movement large bodies of infantry to the\r\nnorth side, while the same time Kautz was made to skirmish with the\r\nenemy on our extreme right.  These various artifices had the effect\r\nintended, for by the evening of the 29th Lee had transferred all his\r\ninfantry to the north bank of the James, except three divisions, and\r\nall his cavalry save one.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the 30th had been fixed upon to explode the mine and\r\nassault the enemy's works, so after dark on the evening of the 29th\r\nHancock hastily but quietly withdrew his corps to the south side to\r\ntake part in the engagement which was to succeed the explosion, and I\r\nwas directed to follow Hancock.  This left me on the north side of\r\nthe river confronting two-thirds of Lee's army in a perilous\r\nposition, where I could easily be driven into Curl's Neck and my\r\nwhole command annihilated.  The situation, therefore, was not a\r\npleasant one to contemplate, but it could not be avoided.  Luckily\r\nthe enemy did not see fit to attack, and my anxiety was greatly\r\nrelieved by getting the whole command safely across the bridge\r\nshortly after daylight, having drawn in the different brigades\r\nsuccessively from my right.  By 10 o'clock on the morning of the 30th\r\nmy leading division was well over toward the left of our army in\r\nfront of Petersburg, marching with the purpose to get around the\r\nenemy's right flank during the operations that were to succeed the\r\nmine explosion, but when I reached General Meade's headquarters I\r\nfound that lamentable failure had attended the assault made when the\r\nenemy's works were blown up in the morning.  Blunder after blunder\r\nhad rendered the assault abortive, and all the opportunities opened\r\nby our expedition to the north side were irretrievably lost, so\r\nGeneral Meade at once arrested the movement of the cavalry.\r\n\r\nIn the expedition to Deep Bottom I was under the command of\r\nMajor-General Hancock, who, by seniority, was to control my corps as\r\nwell as his own until the way was opened for me to get out on the\r\nVirginia Central railroad.  If this opportunity was gained, I was to\r\ncut loose and damage Lee's communications with the Shenandoah Valley\r\nin such manner as best suited the conditions, but my return was not to\r\nbe jeopardized nor long delayed.  This necessitated that Hancock's\r\nline should extend to Bottom's bridge on the Chickahominy.  The\r\nenemy's early discovery of the movement and his concentration of\r\ntroops on the north side prevented Hancock from accomplishing the\r\nprogramme laid out for him.  Its impracticability was demonstrated\r\nearly on the 27th, and Hancock's soldierly instincts told him this the\r\nmoment he unexpectedly discovered Kershaw blocking the New Market and\r\nCharles City roads.  To Hancock the temptation to assault Kershaw's\r\nposition was strong indeed, but if he carried it there would still\r\nremain the dubious problem of holding the line necessary for my safe\r\nreturn, so with rare judgment he desisted zealously turning to the\r\nalternative proposition--the assault on Petersburg--for more\r\nsignificant results. This was the only occasion during the war in\r\nwhich I was associated with Hancock in campaign.  Up till then we had\r\nseldom met, and that was the first opportunity I had to observe his\r\nquick apprehension, his physical courage, and the soldierly\r\npersonality which had long before established his high reputation.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of August, two days after the mine explosion, I was.\r\nrelieved from the personal command of the Cavalry Corps, and ordered\r\nto the Shenandoah Valley, where at a later date Torbert's and\r\nWilson's divisions joined me.  Practically, after I went to the\r\nvalley, my command of the Cavalry Corps became supervisory merely.\r\nDuring the period of my immediate control of the corps, I tried to\r\ncarry into effect, as far as possible, the views I had advanced\r\nbefore and during the opening of the Wilderness campaign, i.e., \"that\r\nour cavalry ought to fight the enemy's cavalry, and our infantry the\r\nenemy's infantry\"; for there was great danger of breaking the spirit\r\nof the corps if it was to be pitted against the enemy's compact\r\nmasses of foot-troops posted behind intrenchments, and unless there\r\nwas some adequate tactical or strategical advantage to be gained,\r\nsuch a use of it would not be justified.  Immediately succeeding the\r\nbattles of the Wilderness, opportunity offered to put this plan into\r\nexecution to some extent, and from that time forward--from the battle\r\nof Yellow Tavern--our success was almost continuous, resulting\r\nfinally, before the close of the war, in the nearly total\r\nannihilation of the enemy's cavalry.\r\n\r\nThe constant activity of the corps from May 5 till August 1 gave\r\nlittle opportunity for the various division and brigade commanders to\r\nrecord its work in detail; so there exists but meagre accounts of the\r\nnumerous skirmishes and graver conflicts in which, in addition to the\r\nfights mentioned in this narrative, it engaged.  A detailed history\r\nof its performances is not within the province of a work of this\r\nnature; but in review, it can be said, without trespassing on the\r\nreader's time, that the Cavalry Corps led the advance of the Army of\r\nthe Potomac into the Wilderness in the memorable campaign of 1864;\r\nthat on the expedition by way of Richmond to Haxall's it marked out\r\nthe army's line of march to the North Anna; that it again led the\r\nadvance to the Tolopotomy, and also to Cold Harbor, holding that\r\nimportant strategic point at great hazard; and that by the Trevillian\r\nexpedition it drew away the enemy's cavalry from the south side of\r\nthe Chickahominy, and thereby assisted General Grant materially in\r\nsuccessfully marching to the James River and Petersburg.\r\nSubsequently, Wilson made his march to Staunton bridge, destroying\r\nrailroads and supplies of inestimable value, and though this was\r\nneutralized by his disaster near Ream's Station, the temporary\r\nset-back there to one division was soon redeemed by victory over\r\nthe Confederate infantry at the battle of Darbytown.\r\n\r\nIn the campaign we were almost always on the march, night and day,\r\noften unable to care properly for our wounded, and obliged to bury\r\nour dead where they fell; and innumerable combats attest the part the\r\ncavalry played in Grant's march from the Rapidan to Petersburg.  In\r\nnearly all of these our casualties were heavy, particularly so when,\r\nas was often the case, we had to engage the Confederate infantry; but\r\nthe enemy returned such a full equivalent in dead and wounded in\r\nevery instance, that finally his mounted power, which from the\r\nbeginning of the war had been nurtured with a wise appreciation of\r\nits value, was utterly broken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nGENERAL HUNTER'S SUCCESSFUL MARCH AND SUBSEQUENT RETREAT--GENERAL\r\nJUBAL A. EARLY THREATENS WASHINGTON--CHAMBERSBURG, PA., BURNED\r\n--SELECTED TO OPERATE AGAINST GENERAL EARLY--THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY\r\n--THE CONFEDERATE ARMY.\r\n\r\nWhen the attempt to take Petersburg in conjunction with the mine\r\nexplosion resulted in such a dismal failure, all the operations\r\ncontemplated in connection with that project came to a standstill,\r\nand there was every prospect that the intensely hot and sultry\r\nweather would prevent further activity in the Army of the Potomac\r\ntill a more propitious season.  Just now, however, the conditions\r\nexisting in the Shenandoah Valley and along the upper Potomac\r\ndemanded the special attention of General Grant, for, notwithstanding\r\nthe successful march that Major-General David Hunter had made toward\r\nLynchburg early in the summer, what he had first gained was\r\nsubsequently lost by strategical mistakes, that culminated in\r\ndisaster during the retreat he was obliged to make from the vicinity\r\nof Lynchburg to the Kanawha Valley.  This route of march uncovered\r\nthe lower portion of the Valley of the Shenandoah, and with the\r\nexception of a small force of Union troops under General Franz Sigel\r\nposted aft Martinsburg for the purpose of covering the Baltimore and\r\nOhio railroad, there was nothing at hand to defend the lower valley.\r\n\r\nThe different bodies of Confederates which compelled Hunter's retreat\r\nwere under command of General Jubal A. Early, who had been sent to\r\nLynchburg with Ewell's corps after the defeat of the Confederate\r\nGeneral W. C. Jones near Staunton on the 5th of June, to take command\r\nof the Valley District.  When Early had forced Hunter into the\r\nKanawha region far enough to feel assured that Lynchburg could not\r\nagain be threatened from that direction, he united to his own corps\r\nGeneral John C. Breckenridge's infantry division and the cavalry of\r\nGenerals J. H. Vaughn, John McCausland.  B. T. Johnson, and J. D.\r\nImboden, which heretofore had been operating in southwest and western\r\nVirginia under General Robert Ransom, Jr., and with the column thus\r\nformed, was ready to turn his attention to the lower Shenandoah\r\nValley.  At Early's suggestion General Lee authorized him to move\r\nnorth at an opportune moment, cross the upper Potomac into Maryland\r\nand threaten Washington.  Indeed, General Lee had foreshadowed such a\r\ncourse when Early started toward Lynchburg for the purpose of\r\nrelieving the pressure in front of Petersburg, but was in some doubt\r\nas to the practicability of the movement later, till persuaded to it\r\nby the representations of Early after that general had driven Hunter\r\nbeyond the mountains and found little or nothing opposing except the\r\nsmall force of Sigel, which he thought he could readily overcome by\r\ncelerity of movement.\r\n\r\nBy rapid marching Early reached Winchester on the 2d of July, and on\r\nthe 4th occupied Martinsburg, driving General Sigel out of that place\r\nthe same day that Hunter's troops, after their fatiguing retreat\r\nthrough the mountains, reached Charlestown, West Virginia.  Early was\r\nthus enabled to cross the Potomac without difficulty, when, moving\r\naround Harper's Ferry, through the gaps of the South Mountain, he\r\nfound his path unobstructed till he reached the Monocacy, where\r\nRicketts's division of the Sixth Corps, and some raw troops that had\r\nbeen collected by General Lew Wallace, met and held the Confederates\r\ntill the other reinforcements that had been ordered to the capital\r\nfrom Petersburg could be brought up.  Wallace contested the line of\r\nthe Monocacy with obstinacy, but had to retire finally toward\r\nBaltimore.  The road was then open to Washington, and Early marched\r\nto the outskirts and began against the capital the demonstrations\r\nwhich were designed to divert the Army of the Potomac from its main\r\npurpose in front of Petersburg.\r\n\r\nEarly's audacity in thus threatening Washington had caused some\r\nconcern to the officials in the city, but as the movement was looked\r\nupon by General Grant as a mere foray which could have no decisive\r\nissue, the Administration was not much disturbed till the\r\nConfederates came in close proximity.  Then was repeated the alarm\r\nand consternation of two years before, fears for the safety of the\r\ncapital being magnified by the confusion and discord existing among\r\nthe different generals in Washington and Baltimore; and the imaginary\r\ndangers vanished only with the appearance of General Wright, who,\r\nwith the Sixth Corps and one division of the Nineteenth Corps, pushed\r\nout to attack Early as soon as he could get his arriving troops in\r\nhand, but under circumstances that precluded celerity of movement;\r\nand as a consequence the Confederates escaped with little injury,\r\nretiring across the Potomac to Leesburg, unharassed save by some\r\nUnion cavalry that had been sent out into Loudoun County by Hunter,\r\nwho in the meantime had arrived at Harper's Ferry by the Baltimore\r\nand Ohio railroad.  From Leesburg Early retired through Winchester\r\ntoward Strasburg, but when the head of his column reached this place\r\nhe found that he was being followed by General Crook with the\r\ncombined troops of Hunter and Sigel only, Wright having returned to\r\nWashington under orders to rejoin Meade at Petersburg.  This\r\nreduction of the pursuing force tempting Early to resume the\r\noffensive, he attacked Crook at Kernstown, and succeeded in\r\nadministering such a check as to necessitate this general's retreat\r\nto Martinsburg, and finally to Harper's Ferry.  Crook's withdrawal\r\nrestored to Early the line of the upper Potomac, so, recrossing this\r\nstream, he advanced again into Maryland, and sending McCausland on to\r\nChambersburg, Pennsylvania, laid that town in ashes, leaving three\r\nthousand non-combatants without shelter or food.\r\n\r\nWhen Early fell back from the vicinity of Washington toward\r\nStrasburg, General Grant believed that he would rejoin Lee, but later\r\nmanoeuvres of the enemy indicated that Early had given up this idea,\r\nif he ever, entertained it, and intended to remain in the valley,\r\nsince it would furnish Lee and himself with subsistence, and also\r\nafford renewed opportunities for threatening Washington.  Indeed, the\r\npossession of the Valley of the Shenandoah at this time was of vast\r\nimportance to Lee's army, and on every hand there were indications\r\nthat the Confederate Government wished to hold it at least until\r\nafter the crops could be gathered in to their depots at Lynchburg and\r\nRichmond.  Its retention, besides being of great advantage in the\r\nmatter of supplies, would also be a menace to the North difficult for\r\nGeneral Grant to explain, and thereby add an element of considerable\r\nbenefit to the Confederate cause; so when Early's troops again\r\nappeared at Martinsburg it was necessary for General Grant to\r\nconfront them with a force strong enough to put an end to incursions\r\nnorth of the Potomac, which hitherto had always led to National\r\ndiscomfiture at some critical juncture, by turning our army in\r\neastern Virginia from its chief purpose--the destruction of Lee and\r\nthe capture of the Confederate capital.\r\n\r\nThis second irruption of Early, and his ruthless destruction of\r\nChambersburg led to many recommendations on the part of General Grant\r\nlooking to a speedy elimination of the confusion then existing among\r\nthe Union forces along the upper Potomac, but for a time the\r\nauthorities at Washington would approve none of his propositions.\r\nThe President and Secretary Stanton seemed unwilling to adopt his\r\nsuggestions, and one measure which he deemed very important--the\r\nconsolidation into a single command of the four geographical\r\ndistricts into which, to relieve political pressure no doubt, the\r\nterritory had been divided--met with serious opposition.  Despite\r\nGrant's representations, he could not prevail on the Administration\r\nto approve this measure, but finally the manoeuvres of Early and the\r\nraid to Chambersburg compelled a partial compliance, though Grant had\r\nsomewhat circumvented the difficulty already by deciding to appoint a\r\ncommander for the forces in the field that were to operate against\r\nEarly.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of July General Grant selected me as this commander, and\r\nin obedience to his telegraphic summons I repaired to his\r\nheadquarters at City Point.  In the interview that followed, he\r\ndetailed to me the situation of affairs on the upper Potomac, telling\r\nme that I was to command in the field the troops that were to operate\r\nagainst Early, but that General Hunter, who was at the head of the\r\ngeographical department, would be continued in his position for the\r\nreason that the Administration was reluctant to reconstruct or\r\nconsolidate the different districts.  After informing me that one\r\ndivision of the Cavalry Corps would be sent to my new command, he\r\nwent on to say that he wanted me to push the enemy as soon as this\r\ndivision arrived, and if Early retired up the Shenandoah Valley I was\r\nto pursue, but if he crossed the Potomac I was to put myself south of\r\nhim and try to compass his destruction.  The interview having ended,\r\nI returned to Hancock Station to prepare for my departure, and on the\r\nevening of August 1 I was relieved from immediate duty with the Army\r\nof the Potomac, but not from command of the cavalry as a corps\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nI arrived at Washington on the 4th of August, and the next day\r\nreceived instructions from General Halleck to report to General Grant\r\nat Monocacy Junction, whither he had gone direct from City Point, in\r\nconsequence of a characteristic despatch from the President\r\nindicating his disgust with the confusion, disorder, and helplessness\r\nprevailing along the upper Potomac, and intimating that Grant's\r\npresence there was necessary.\r\n\r\nIn company with the Secretary of War I called on the President before\r\nleaving Washington, and during a short conversation Mr. Lincoln\r\ncandidly told me that Mr. Stanton had objected to my assignment to\r\nGeneral Hunter's command, because he thought me too young, and that\r\nhe himself had concurred with the Secretary; but now, since General\r\nGrant had \"ploughed round\" the difficulties of the situation by\r\npicking me out to command the \"boys in the field,\" he felt satisfied\r\nwith what had been done, and \"hoped for the best.\"  Mr. Stanton\r\nremained silent during these remarks, never once indicating whether\r\nhe, too, had become reconciled to my selection or not; and although,\r\nafter we left the White House, he conversed with me freely in regard\r\nto the campaign I was expected to make, seeking to impress on me the\r\nnecessity for success from the political as well as from the military\r\npoint of view, yet he utterly ignored the fact that he had taken any\r\npart in disapproving the recommendation of the general-in-chief.\r\n\r\nAugust 6, I reported to General Grant at the Monocacy, and he there\r\nturned over to me the following instructions, which he had previously\r\nprepared for General Hunter in the expectation that general would\r\ncontinue to command the department:\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS IN THE FIELD,\r\n\"Monocacy Bridge, Md., Aug.  5, 1864.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL: Concentrate all your available force without delay in the\r\nvicinity of Harper's Ferry, leaving only such railroad guards and\r\ngarrisons for public property as may be necessary.\r\n\r\n\"Use in this concentration the railroad, if by so doing time can be\r\nsaved.  From Harper's Ferry, if it is found that the enemy has moved\r\nnorth of the Potomac in large force, push north, following and\r\nattacking him wherever found; following him, if driven south of the\r\nPotomac, as long as it is safe to do so.  If it is ascertained that\r\nthe enemy has but a small force north of the Potomac, then push south\r\nthe main force, detaching, under a competent commander, a sufficient\r\nforce to look after the raiders and drive them to their homes.  In\r\ndetaching such a force, the brigade of cavalry now en route from\r\nWashington via Rockville may be taken into account.\r\n\r\n\"There are now on the way to join you three other brigades of the\r\nbest of cavalry, numbering at least five thousand men and horses.\r\nThese will be instructed, in the absence of further orders, to join\r\nyou by the south side of the Potomac.  One brigade will probably\r\nstart to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\"In pushing up the Shenandoah Valley, as it is expected you will have\r\nto go first or last, it is desirable that nothing should be left to\r\ninvite the enemy to return.  Take all provisions, forage, and stock\r\nwanted for the use of your command.  Such as cannot be consumed,\r\ndestroy.  It is not desirable that the buildings should be destroyed\r\n--they should, rather, be protected; but the people should be informed\r\nthat so long as an army can subsist among them recurrences of these\r\nraids must be expected, and we are determined to stop them at all\r\nhazards.\r\n\r\n\"Bear in mind, the object is to drive the enemy south; and to do this\r\nyou want to keep him always in sight.

S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.\"\r\n\r\n\"Major-General D. HUNTER,\r\n\"Commanding Department of West Virginia.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I had read the letter addressed to Hunter, General Grant said I\r\nwould be expected to report directly to him, as Hunter had asked that\r\nday to be wholly relieved, not from any chagrin at my assignment to\r\nthe control of the active forces of his command, but because he\r\nthought that his fitness for the position he was filling was\r\ndistrusted by General Halleck, and he had no wish to cause\r\nembarrassment by remaining where he could but remove me one degree\r\nfrom the headquarters of the army.  The next day Hunter's unselfish\r\nrequest was complied with, and an order was issued by the President,\r\nconsolidating the Middle Department, the Department of Washington,\r\nthe Department of the Susquehanna, and the Department of West\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nUnder this order these four geographical districts constituted the\r\nMiddle Military Division, and I was temporarily assigned to command\r\nit.  Hunter's men had been bivouacking for some days past in the\r\nvicinity of Monocacy Junction and Frederick, but before General\r\nGrant's instructions were written out, Hunter had conformed to them\r\nby directing the concentration at Halltown, about four miles in front\r\nof Harper's Ferry, of all his force available for field service.\r\nTherefore the different bodies of troops, with the exception of\r\nAverell's cavalry, which had followed McCausland toward Moorefield\r\nafter the burning of Chambersburg, were all in motion toward Halltown\r\non August 6.\r\n\r\nAffairs at Monocacy kept me but an hour or two, and these disposed\r\nof, I continued on to Harper's Ferry by the special train which had\r\nbrought me from Washington, that point being intended as my\r\nheadquarters while making preparations to advance.  The enemy was\r\noccupying Martinsburg, Williamsport, and Shepherdstown at the time;\r\nsending occasional raiding parties into Maryland as far as\r\nHagerstown.  The concentration of my troops at Halltown being an\r\nindication to Early that we intended to renew the offensive, however,\r\nhe immediately began counter preparations by drawing in all his\r\ndetached columns from the north side of the Potomac, abandoning a\r\ncontemplated raid into Maryland, which his success against Crook at\r\nKernstown had prompted him to project, and otherwise disposing\r\nhimself for defense.\r\n\r\nAt Harper's Ferry I made my headquarters in the second story of a\r\nsmall and very dilapidated hotel, and as soon as settled sent for\r\nLieutenant John R. Meigs, the chief engineer officer of the command,\r\nto study with him the maps of my geographical division.  It always\r\ncame rather easy to me to learn the geography of a new section, and\r\nits important topographical features as well; therefore I found that,\r\nwith the aid of Meigs, who was most intelligent in his profession,\r\nthe region in which I was to operate would soon be well fixed in my\r\nmind.  Meigs was familiar with every important road and stream, and\r\nwith all points worthy of note west of the Blue Ridge, and was\r\nparticularly well equipped with knowledge regarding the Shenandoah\r\nValley, even down to the farmhouses.  He imparted with great\r\nreadiness what he knew of this, clearly pointing out its\r\nconfiguration and indicating the strongest points for Confederate\r\ndefense, at the same time illustrating scientifically and forcibly\r\nthe peculiar disadvantages under which the Union army had hitherto\r\nlabored.\r\n\r\nThe section that received my closest attention has its northern limit\r\nalong the Potomac between McCoy's ferry at the eastern base of the\r\nNorth Mountain, and Harper's Ferry at the western base of the Blue\r\nRidge.  The southern limit is south of Staunton, on the divide which\r\nseparates the waters flowing into the Potomac from those that run to\r\nthe James.  The western boundary is the eastern slope of the\r\nAlleghany Mountains, the eastern, the Blue Ridge; these two distinct\r\nmountain ranges trending about southwest inclose a stretch of quite\r\nopen, undulating country varying in width from the northern to the\r\nsouthern extremity, and dotted at frequent intervals with patches of\r\nheavy woods: At Martinsburg the valley is about sixty miles broad,\r\nand on an east and west line drawn through Winchester about\r\nforty-five, while at Strasburg it narrows down to about twenty-five.\r\nJust southeast of Strasburg, which is nearly midway between the\r\neastern and western walls of the valley, rises an abrupt range of\r\nmountains called Massanutten, consisting of several ridges which\r\nextend southward between the North and South Forks of the Shenandoah\r\nRiver until, losing their identity, they merge into lower but broken\r\nground between New Market and Harrisonburg.  The Massanutten ranges,\r\nwith their spurs and hills, divide the Shenandoah Valley into two\r\nvalleys, the one next the Blue Ridge being called the Luray, while\r\nthat next the North Mountain retains the name of Shenandoah.\r\n\r\nA broad macadamized road, leading south from Williamsport, Maryland,\r\nto Lexington, Virginia, was built at an early day to connect the\r\ninterior of the latter State with the Chesapeake and Ohio canal, and\r\nalong this road are situated the principal towns and villages of the\r\nShenandoah Valley, with lateral lines of communication extending to\r\nthe mountain ranges on the east and west.  The roads running toward\r\nthe Blue Ridge are nearly all macadamized, and the principal ones\r\nlead to the railroad system of eastern Virginia through Snicker's,\r\nAshby's Manassas, Chester, Thornton's Swift Run, Brown's and\r\nRock-fish gaps, tending to an ultimate centre at Richmond.  These gaps\r\nare low and easy, offering little obstruction to the march of an army\r\ncoming from eastern Virginia, and thus the Union troops operating west\r\nof the Blue Ridge were always subjected to the perils of a flank\r\nattack; for the Confederates could readily be brought by rail to\r\nGordonsville and Charlottesville, from which points they could move\r\nwith such celerity through the Blue Ridge that, on more than one\r\noccasion, the Shenandoah Valley had been the theatre of Confederate\r\nsuccess, due greatly to the advantage of possessing these interior\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nNature had been very kind to the valley, making it rich and\r\nproductive to an exceptional degree, and though for three years\r\ncontending armies had been marching up and down it, the fertile soil\r\nstill yielded ample subsistence for Early's men, with a large surplus\r\nfor the army of Lee.  The ground had long been well cleared of\r\ntimber, and the rolling surface presented so few obstacles to the\r\nmovement of armies that they could march over the country in any\r\ndirection almost as well as on the roads, the creeks and rivers being\r\neverywhere fordable, with little or no difficulty beyond that of\r\nleveling the approaches.\r\n\r\nI had opposing me an army largely composed of troops that had\r\noperated in this region hitherto under \"Stonewall\" Jackson with\r\nmarked success, inflicting defeat on the Union forces almost every\r\ntime the two armies had come in contact. These men were now commanded\r\nby a veteran officer of the Confederacy-General Jubal A. Early--whose\r\npast services had so signalized his ability that General Lee\r\nspecially selected him to take charge of the Valley District, and,\r\nnotwithstanding the misfortunes that befell him later, clung to him\r\ntill the end, of the war.  The Confederate army at this date was\r\nabout twenty thousand strong, and consisted of Early's own corps,\r\nwith Generals Rodes, Ramseur, and Gordon commanding its divisions;\r\nthe infantry of Breckenridge from southwestern Virginia; three\r\nbattalions of artillery; and the cavalry brigades of Vaughn, Johnson,\r\nMcCausland, and Imboden.  This cavalry was a short time afterward\r\norganized into a division under the command of General Lomax.\r\n\r\nAfter discovering that my troops were massing in front of Harper's\r\nFerry, Early lost not a moment in concentrating his in the vicinity\r\nof Martinsburg, in positions from which he could continue to obstruct\r\nthe Baltimore and Ohio railroad, and yet be enabled to retire up the\r\nvalley under conditions of safety when I should begin an offensive\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nWhen I took command of the Army of the Shenandoah its infantry force\r\ncomprised the Sixth Corps, one division of the Nineteenth Corps, and\r\ntwo divisions from West Virginia.  The Sixth Corps was commanded\r\nby Major-General Horatio G. Wright; its three divisions by\r\nBrigadier-Generals David A. Russell, Geo.  W. Getty, and James B.\r\nRicketts. The single division of the Nineteenth Corps had for its\r\nimmediate chief Brigadier-General William Dwight, the corps being\r\ncommanded by Brigadier-General Wm.  H. Emory.  The troops from West\r\nVirginia were under Brigadier-General George Crook, with Colonels\r\nJoseph Thoburn and Isaac H. Duval as division commanders, and though\r\nin all not more than one fair-sized division, they had been\r\ndesignated, on account of the department they belonged to, the Army of\r\nWest Virginia.  General Torbert's division, then arriving from the\r\nCavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac, represented the mounted arm\r\nof the service, and in the expectation that Averell would soon join me\r\nwith his troopers, I assigned General Torbert as chief of cavalry, and\r\nGeneral Wesley Merritt succeeded to the command of Torbert's division.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wright, the commander of the Sixth Corps, was an officer of\r\nhigh standing in the Corps of Engineers, and had seen much active\r\nservice during the preceding three years.  He commanded the\r\nDepartment of the Ohio throughout the very trying period of the\r\nsummer and fall of 1862, and while in that position he, with\r\nother prominent officers, recommended my appointment as a\r\nbrigadier-general.  In 1863 he rendered valuable service at the battle\r\nof Gettysburg, following which he was assigned to the Sixth Corps, and\r\ncommanded it at the capture of the Confederate works at Rappahannock\r\nStation and in the operations at Mine Run.  He ranked me as a\r\nmajor-general of volunteers by nearly a year in date of commission,\r\nbut my assignment by the President to the command of the army in the\r\nvalley met with Wright's approbation, and, so far as I have ever\r\nknown, he never questioned the propriety of the President's action.\r\nThe Sixth Corps division commanders, Getty, Russell, and Ricketts,\r\nwere all educated soldiers, whose records, beginning with the Mexican\r\nWar, had already been illustrated in the war of the rebellion by\r\ndistinguished service in the Army of the Potomac.\r\n\r\nGeneral Emory was a veteran, having graduated at the Military Academy\r\nin 1831, the year I was born.  In early life he had seen much service\r\nin the Artillery, the Topographical Engineers, and the Cavalry, and\r\nin the war of the rebellion had exhibited the most soldierly\r\ncharacteristics at Port Hudson and on the Red River campaign.  At\r\nthis time he had but one division of the Nineteenth Corps present,\r\nwhich division was well commanded by General Dwight, a volunteer\r\nofficer who had risen to the grade of brigadier-general through\r\nconstant hard work.  Crook was a classmate of mine--at least, we\r\nentered the Military Academy the same year, though he graduated a\r\nyear ahead of me.  We had known each other as boys before we entered\r\nthe army, and later as men, and I placed implicit faith in his\r\nexperience and qualifications as a general.\r\n\r\nThe transfer of Torbert to the position of chief of cavalry left\r\nMerritt, as I have already said, in command of the First Cavalry\r\nDivision.  He had been tried in the place before, and from the day he\r\nwas selected as one of a number of young men to be appointed general\r\nofficers, with the object of giving life to the Cavalry Corps, he\r\nfilled the measure of expectation.  Custer was one of these young men\r\ntoo, and though as yet commanding a brigade under Merritt, his\r\ngallant fight at Trevillian Station, as well as a dozen others during\r\nthe summer, indicated that he would be equal to the work that was to\r\nfall to him when in a few weeks he should succeed Wilson.  But to go\r\non down the scale of rank, describing the officers who commanded in\r\nthe Army of the Shenandoah, would carry me beyond all limit, so I\r\nrefrain from the digression with regret that I cannot pay to each his\r\nwell-earned tribute.\r\n\r\nThe force that I could take with me into the field at this time\r\nnumbered about 26,000 men.  Within the limits of the geographical\r\ndivision there was a much greater number of troops than this.\r\nBaltimore, Washington, Harper's Ferry, Hagerstown, Frederick,\r\nCumberland, and a score of other points; besides the strong\r\ndetachments that it took to keep the Baltimore and Ohio railroad open\r\nthrough the mountains of West Virginia, and escorts for my trains,\r\nabsorbed so many men that the column which could be made available\r\nfor field operations was small when compared with the showing on\r\npaper.  Indeed, it was much less than it ought to have been, but for\r\nme, in the face of the opposition made by different interests\r\ninvolved, to detach troops from any of the points to which they had\r\nbeen distributed before I took charge was next to impossible.\r\n\r\nIn a few days after my arrival preparations were completed, and I was\r\nready to make the first move for the possession of the Shenandoah\r\nValley.  For the next five weeks the operations on my part consisted\r\nalmost wholly of offensive and defensive manoeuvring for certain\r\nadvantages, the enemy confining himself meanwhile to measures\r\nintended to counteract my designs.  Upon the advent of Torbert, Early\r\nimmediately grew suspicious, and fell back twelve miles south of\r\nMartinsburg, to Bunker Hill and vicinity, where his right flank would\r\nbe less exposed, but from which position he could continue to\r\nmaintain the break in the Baltimore and Ohio railroad, and push\r\nreconnoitring parties through Smithfield to Charlestown.  These\r\nreconnoitring parties exhibited considerable boldness at times, but\r\nsince they had no purpose in view save to discover whether or not we\r\nwere moving, I did not contest any ground with them except about our\r\noutposts.  Indeed, I desired that Early might remain at some point\r\nwell to the north till I was fully prepared to throw my army on his\r\nright and rear and force a battle, and hence I abstained from\r\ndisturbing him by premature activity, for I thought that if I could\r\nbeat him at Winchester, or north of it, there would be far greater\r\nchances of weighty results.  I therefore determined to bring my\r\ntroops, if it were at all possible to do so, into such a position\r\nnear that town as to oblige Early to fight.  The sequel proved,\r\nhowever, that he was accurately informed of all my movements.  To\r\nanticipate them, therefore, he began his retreat up the valley the\r\nday that I moved out from Halltown, and consequently was able to\r\nplace himself south of Winchester before I could get there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nMOVING ON GENERAL EARLY--GENERAL GRANT'S LETTER OF INSTRUCTIONS\r\n--DESTROYING THE RESOURCES OF THE VALLEY--REASON FOR THE DESTRUCTION\r\n--WITHDRAWAL TO HALLTOWN--ALARM IN THE NORTH OVER THE RETROGRADE\r\nMOVEMENT--RENEWING THE ADVANCE UP THE VALLEY--GENERAL ANDERSON'S\r\nATTEMPT TO RETURN TO PETERSBURG--STRENGTH OF THE ARMIES.\r\n\r\nFor a clear understanding of the operations which preceded the\r\nvictories that resulted in almost annihilating General Early's army\r\nin the Shenandoah Valley, it is necessary to describe in considerable\r\ndetail the events that took place prior to the 19th of September.  My\r\narmy marched from Harper's Ferry on the 10th of August, 1864, General\r\nTorbert with Merritt's division of cavalry moving in advance through\r\nBerryville, going into position near White Post.  The Sixth Corps,\r\nunder General Wright, moved by way of Charlestown and Summit Point to\r\nClifton; General Emory, with Dwight's division of the Nineteenth\r\nCorps, marched along the Berryville pike through Berryville to the\r\nleft of the position of the Sixth Corps at Clifton; General Crook's\r\ncommand, moving on the Kabletown road, passed through Kabletown to\r\nthe vicinity of Berryville, and went into position on the left of\r\nDwight's division, while Colonel Lowell, with a detached force of two\r\nsmall regiments of cavalry, marched to Summit Point; so that on the\r\nnight of August 10 my infantry occupied a line stretching from\r\nClifton to Berryville, with Merritt's cavalry at White Post and\r\nLowell's at Summit Point.  The enemy, as stated before, moved at the\r\nsame time from Bunker Hill and vicinity, and stretched his line from\r\nwhere the Winchester and Potomac railroad crosses Opequon Creek to\r\nthe point at which the Berryville and Winchester pike crosses the\r\nsame stream, thus occupying the west bank to cover Winchester.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 11th the Sixth Corps was ordered to move across\r\nthe country toward the junction of the Berryville-Winchester pike and\r\nthe Opequon, and to take the crossing and hold it, Dwight's division\r\nbeing directed to move through Berryville on the White Post road for\r\na mile, then file to the right by heads of regiments at deploying\r\ndistances, and carry the crossing of Opequon Creek at a ford about\r\nthree-fourths of a mile from the left of the Sixth Corps, while Crook\r\nwas instructed to move out on the White Post road, a mile and a half\r\nbeyond Berryville, then head to the right and secure the ford about a\r\nmile to the left of Dwight; Torbert's orders were to push Merritt's\r\ndivision up the Millwood pike toward Winchester, attack any force he\r\nmight run against, and ascertain the movements of the Confederate\r\narmy; and lastly, Lowell received instructions to close in from\r\nSummit Point on the right of the Sixth Corps.\r\n\r\nMy object in securing the fords was to further my march on Winchester\r\nfrom the southeast, since, from all the information gathered during\r\nthe 10th, I still thought Early could be brought to a stand at that\r\npoint; but in this I was mistaken, as Torbert's reconnoissance\r\nproved, for on the morning of the 11th, when Merritt had driven the\r\nConfederate cavalry, then covering the Millwood pike west of the\r\nOpequon, off toward Kernstown, he found that their infantry and\r\nartillery were retreating south, up the Valley pike.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this information was obtained Torbert moved quickly\r\nthrough the toll-gate on the Front Royal and Winchester road to\r\nNewtown, to strike the enemy's flank and harass him in his retreat,\r\nLowell following up through Winchester, on the Valley pike; Crook was\r\nturned to the left and ordered to Stony Point, while Emory and\r\nWright, marching to the left also, were directed to take post on the\r\nnight of the 11th between the Millwood and Front Royal roads, within\r\nsupporting distance of Crook.  Merritt meeting some of the enemy's\r\ncavalry at the tollgate, drove it in the direction of Newtown till it\r\ngot inside the line of Gordon's division of infantry, which had been\r\nthrown out and posted behind barricades to cover the flank of the\r\nmain force in its retreat.  A portion of Merritt's cavalry attacked\r\nthis infantry and drove in its skirmish-line, and though not able to\r\ndislodge Gordon, Merritt held the ground gained till night-fall, when\r\nthe Confederate infantry moved off under cover of darkness to Hupp's\r\nHill, between Strasburg and Cedar Creek.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Crook marched from Stony Point to Cedar Creek, Emory\r\nfollowed with Dwight, and the cavalry moved to the same point by way\r\nof Newtown and the Valley pike, the Sixth Corps following the\r\ncavalry.  That night Crook was in position at Cedar Creek, on the\r\nleft of the Valley pike, Emory on the right of the pike, the Sixth\r\nCorps on the right of Emory, and the cavalry on the flanks.  In the\r\nafternoon a heavy skirmish-line had been thrown forward to the\r\nheights on the south side of Cedar Creek, and a brisk affair with the\r\nenemy's pickets took place, the Confederates occupying with their\r\nmain force the heights north of Strasburg.  On the morning of the\r\n13th my cavalry went out to reconnoitre toward Strasburg, on the\r\nmiddle road, about two and a half miles west of the Valley pike, and\r\ndiscovered that Early's infantry was at Fisher's Hill, where he had\r\nthrown up behind Tumbling Run earthworks extending clear across the\r\nnarrow valley between the Massanutten and North mountains.  On the\r\nleft of these works he had Vaughan's, McCausland's, and Johnson's\r\nbrigades of cavalry under General Lomax, who at this time relieved\r\nGeneral Ramseur from the command of the Confederate mounted forces.\r\n\r\nWithin the past day or two I had received information that a column\r\nof the enemy was moving up from Culpeper Court House and approaching\r\nFront Royal through Chester Gap, and although the intelligence was\r\nunconfirmed, it caused me much solicitude; for there was strong\r\nprobability that such a movement would be made, and any considerable\r\nforce advancing through Front Royal toward Winchester could fall upon\r\nmy rear and destroy my communication with Harper's Ferry, or, moving\r\nalong the base of Massanutten Mountain, could attack my flank in\r\nconjunction with the force at Fisher's Hill without a possibility of\r\nmy preventing it.\r\n\r\nNeither Wilson's cavalry nor Grower's infantry had yet joined me, and\r\nthe necessities, already explained, which obliged me to hold with\r\nstring garrisons Winchester and other points heretofore mentioned.\r\nhad so depleted my line of battle strength that I knew the enemy\r\nwould outnumber me when Anderson's corps should arrive in the valley.\r\nI deemed it advisable, therefore, to act with extreme caution, so,\r\nwith the exception of a cavalry reconnoissance on the 13th, I\r\nremained on the defensive, quietly awaiting developments.  In the\r\nevening of that day the enemy's skirmishers withdrew to Tumbling Run,\r\nhis main force remaining inactive behind the intrenchments at\r\nFisher's Hill waiting for the arrival of Anderson.\r\n\r\nThe rumors in regard to the force advancing from Culpeper kept\r\nincreasing every hour, so on the morning of the 14th I concluded to\r\nsend a brigade of cavalry to Front Royal to ascertain definitely what\r\nwas up.  At the same time I crossed the Sixth Corps to the south side\r\nof Cedar Creek, and occupied the heights near Strasburg.  That day I\r\nreceived from the hands of Colonel Chipman, of the Adjutant-General's\r\nDepartment, the following despatch, to deliver which he had ridden in\r\ngreat haste from Washington through Snicker's Gap, escorted by a\r\nregiment of cavalry:\r\n\r\n\"CITY POINT, August 12, 1864--9 A. M.\r\n\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL HALLECK\r\n\r\n\"Inform General Sheridan that it is now certain two (2) divisions of\r\ninfantry have gone to Early, and some cavalry and twenty (20) pieces\r\nof artillery.  This movement commenced last Saturday night.  He must\r\nbe cautious, and act now on the defensive until movements here force\r\nthem to detach to send this way.  Early's force, with this increase,\r\ncannot exceed forty thousand men, but this is too much for General\r\nSheridan to attack.  Send General Sheridan the remaining brigade of\r\nthe Nineteenth Corps.\r\n\r\n\"I have ordered to Washington all the one-hundred-day men.  Their\r\ntime will soon be out, but for the present they will do to serve in\r\nthe defenses.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe despatch explained the movement from Culpeper, and on the morning\r\nof the 15th Merritt's two remaining brigades were sent to Front Royal\r\nto oppose Anderson, and the Sixth Corps withdrawn to the north side\r\nof Cedar Creek, where it would be in a position enabling me either to\r\nconfront Anderson or to act defensively, as desired by General Grant.\r\n\r\nTo meet the requirements of his instructions I examined the map of\r\nthe valley for a defensive line--a position where a smaller number of\r\ntroops could hold a larger number--for this information led me to\r\nsuppose that Early's force would greatly exceed mine when Anderson's\r\ntwo divisions of infantry and Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry had joined him.\r\nI could see but one such position, and that was at Halltown, in front\r\nof Harper's Ferry.  Subsequent experience convinced me that there was\r\nno other really defensive line in the Shenandoah Valley, for at\r\nalmost any other point the open country and its peculiar topography\r\ninvites rather than forbids flanking operations.\r\n\r\nThis retrograde movement would also enable me to strengthen my\r\ncommand by Grower's division of the Nineteenth Corps and Wilson's\r\ncavalry, both of which divisions were marching from Washington by way\r\nof Snicker's Gap.\r\n\r\nAfter fully considering the matter, I determined to move back to\r\nHalltown, carrying out, as I retired, my instructions to destroy all\r\nthe forage and subsistence the country afforded.  So Emory was\r\nordered to retire to Winchester on the night of the 15th, and Wright\r\nand Crook to follow through Winchester to Clifton the next night.\r\n\r\nFor the cavalry, in this move to the rear, I gave the following\r\ninstructions:\r\n\r\n\"....In pushing up the Shenandoah Valley, as it is expected you will\r\nhave to go first or last, it is desirable that nothing should be left\r\nto invite the enemy to return.  Take all provisions, forage, and\r\nstock wanted for the use of your command.  Such as cannot be\r\nconsumed, destroy.  It is not desirable that buildings should be\r\ndestroyed--they should, rather, be protected; but the people should\r\nbe informed that so long as an army can subsist among them,\r\nrecurrences of these raids must be expected, and we are determined to\r\nstop them at all hazards....\" [Grant's letter of instructions.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,\r\n\"Cedar Creek, Va., August 16, 1864.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL: In compliance with instructions of the Lieutenant-General\r\ncommanding, you will make the necessary arrangements and give the\r\nnecessary orders for the destruction of the wheat and hay south of a\r\nline from Millwood to Winchester and Petticoat Gap.

No houses will be burned, and officers in\r\ncharge of this delicate but necessary duty must inform the people\r\nthat the object is to make this valley untenable for the raiding\r\nparties of the rebel army.\r\n\r\n\"Very respectfully,\r\n\r\n\"P.

TORBERT,\r\n\"Chief of Cavalry, Middle Military Division.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring his visit to General Hunter at the Monocacy, General Grant had\r\nnot only decided to retain in the Shenandoah Valley a large force\r\nsufficient to defeat Early's army or drive it back to Lee, but he had\r\nfurthermore determined to make that sections by the destruction of\r\nits supplies, untenable for continued occupancy by the Confederates.\r\nThis would cut off one of Lee's main-stays in the way of subsistence,\r\nand at the same time diminish the number of recruits and conscripts\r\nhe received; the valley district while under his control not only\r\nsupplying Lee with an abundance of food, but also furnishing him many\r\nmen for his regular and irregular forces.  Grant's instructions to\r\ndestroy the valley began with the letter of August 5 to Hunter, which\r\nwas turned over to me, and this was followed at intervals by more\r\nspecific directions, all showing the earnestness of his purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"CITY POINT, Va., Aug. 16--3:30 P.

M. 1864.\r\n\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN, Halltown, Va.:\r\n\r\n\"Telegraphed you that I had good reason for believing that Fitz Lee\r\nhad been ordered back here.  I now think it likely that all troops\r\nwill be ordered back from the valley except what they believe to be\r\nthe minimum number to detain you.  My reason for supposing this is\r\nbased upon the fact that yielding up the Weldon road seems to be a\r\nblow to the enemy he cannot stand.  I think I do not overstate the\r\nloss of the enemy in the last two weeks at 10,000 killed and wounded.\r\nWe have lost heavily, mostly in captured when the enemy gained\r\ntemporary advantages.  Watch closely, and if you find this theory\r\ncorrect, push with all vigor.  Give the enemy no rest, and if it is\r\npossible to follow to the Virginia Central road, follow that far.  Do\r\nall the damage to railroads and crops you can.  Carry off stock of\r\nall descriptions and negroes, so as to prevent further planting.  If\r\nthe war is to last another year we want the Shenandoah Valley to\r\nremain a barren waste.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n\"CITY POINT, Va., Sept. 4,--10 A.

S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"CITY POINT, Va., Nov. 9, 1864.\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN, Cedar Creek, Va.:\r\n\r\n\"Do you not think it advisable to notify all citizens living east of\r\nthe Blue Ridge to move out north of the Potomac all their stock,\r\ngrain, and provisions of every description?  There is no doubt about\r\nthe necessity of clearing out that country so that it will not\r\nsupport Mosby's gang.  And the question is whether it is not better\r\nthat the people should save what they can.  So long as the war lasts\r\nthey must be prevented from raising another crop, both there and as\r\nhigh up the valley as we can control.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe had rightly concluded that it was time to bring the war home to a\r\npeople engaged in raising crops from a prolific soil to feed the\r\ncountry's enemies, and devoting to the Confederacy its best youth.  I\r\nendorsed the programme in all its parts, for the stores of meat and\r\ngrain that the valley provided, and the men it furnished for Lee's\r\ndepleted regiments, were the strongest auxiliaries he possessed in\r\nthe whole insurgent section.  In war a territory like this is a\r\nfactor of great importance, and whichever adversary controls it\r\npermanently reaps all the advantages of its prosperity.  Hence, as I\r\nhave said, I endorsed Grant's programme, for I do not hold war to\r\nmean simply that lines of men shall engage each other in battle, and\r\nmaterial interests be ignored.  This is but a duel, in which one\r\ncombatant seeks the other's life; war means much more, and is far\r\nworse than this.  Those who rest at home in peace and plenty see but\r\nlittle of the horrors attending such a duel, and even grow\r\nindifferent to them as the struggle goes on, contenting themselves\r\nwith encouraging all who are able-bodied to enlist in the cause, to\r\nfill up the shattered ranks as death thins them.  It is another\r\nmatter, however, when deprivation and suffering are brought to their\r\nown doors.  Then the case appears much graver, for the loss of\r\nproperty weighs heavy with the most of mankind; heavier often, than\r\nthe sacrifices made on the field of battle.  Death is popularly\r\nconsidered the maximum of punishment in war, but it is not; reduction\r\nto poverty brings prayers for peace more surely and more quickly than\r\ndoes the destruction of human life, as the selfishness of man has\r\ndemonstrated in more than one great conflict.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of the 16th I started back to Winchester, whence I\r\ncould better supervise our regressive march.  As I was passing\r\nthrough Newtown, I heard cannonading from the direction of Front\r\nRoyal, and on reaching Winchester, Merritt's couriers brought me word\r\nthat he had been attacked at the crossing of the Shenandoah by\r\nKershaw's division of Anderson's corps and two brigades of Fitzhugh\r\nLee's cavalry, but that the attack had been handsomely repulsed, with\r\na capture of two battle-flags and three hundred prisoners.  This was\r\nan absolute confirmation of the despatch from Grant; and I was now\r\nmore than satisfied with the wisdom of my withdrawal.\r\n\r\nAt daylight of the 17th Emory moved from Winchester to Berryville,\r\nand the same morning Crook and Wright reached Winchester, having\r\nstarted from Cedar Creek the day before.  From Winchester, Crook and\r\nWright resumed their march toward Clifton, Wright, who had the rear\r\nguard, getting that day as far as the Berryville crossing of the\r\nOpequon, where he was ordered to remain, while Crook went ahead till\r\nhe reached the vicinity of Berryville.  On the afternoon of the 17th\r\nLowell with his two regiments of troopers came into Winchester, where\r\nhe was joined by Wilson's mounted division, which had come by a rapid\r\nmarch from Snicker's ferry.  In the mean time Merritt, after his\r\nhandsome engagement with Kershaw near Front Royal, had been ordered\r\nback to the neighborhood of White Post, so that my cavalry outposts\r\nnow extended from this last point around to the west of Winchester.\r\n\r\nDuring all these operations the enemy had a signal-station on Three\r\nTop Mountain, almost overhanging Strasburg, from which every movement\r\nmade by our troops could be plainly seen; therefore, early on the\r\nmorning of the 17th he became aware of the fact that we were retiring\r\ndown the valley, and at once made after us, and about sundown drove\r\nTorbert out of Winchester, he having been left there-with Wilson and\r\nLowell, and the Jersey brigade of the Sixth Corps, to develop the\r\ncharacter of the enemy's pursuit.  After a severe skirmish Wilson and\r\nLowell fell back to Summit Point, and the Jersey brigade joined its\r\ncorps at the crossing of the Opequon.  This affair demonstrated that\r\nEarly's whole army had followed us from Fisher's Hill, in concert\r\nwith Anderson and Fitzhugh Lee from Front Royal, and the two columns\r\njoined near Winchester the morning of the 18th.\r\n\r\nThat day I moved the Sixth Corps by way of Clifton to Flowing Spring,\r\ntwo and a half miles west of Charlestown, on the Smithfield pike; and\r\nEmory, with Dwight's and Grower's divisions (Grower's having joined\r\nthat morning from Washington), to a position about the same distance\r\nsouth of Charlestown, on the Berryville pike.  Following these\r\nmovements, Merritt fell back to Berryville, covering the Berryville\r\npike crossing of the Opequon, and Wilson was stationed at Summit\r\nPoint, whence he held a line along the Opequon as far north as the\r\nbridge at Smithfield.  Crook continued to hold on near Clifton until\r\nthe next day, and was then moved into place on the left of Emory.\r\n\r\nThis line was practically maintained till the 21st, when the enemy,\r\nthrowing a heavy force across the Opequon by the bridge at\r\nSmithfield, drove in my cavalry pickets to Summit Point, and followed\r\nup with a rapid advance against the position of the Sixth Corps near\r\nFlowing Spring.  A sharp and obstinate skirmish with a heavy\r\npicket-line of the Sixth Corps grew out of this manoeuvre, and\r\nresulted very much in our favor, but the quick withdrawal of the\r\nConfederates left no opportunity for a general engagement.  It seems\r\nthat General Early thought I had taken position near Summit Point, and\r\nthat by moving rapidly around through Smithfield he could fall upon my\r\nrear in concert with an attack in front by Anderson, but the warm\r\nreception given him disclosed his error, for he soon discovered that\r\nmy line lay in front of Charlestown instead of where he supposed.\r\n\r\nIn the manoeuvre Merritt had been attacked in front of Berryville and\r\nWilson at Summit Point, the former by cavalry and the latter by\r\nAnderson's infantry.  The exposed positions of Merritt and Wilson\r\nnecessitated their withdrawal if I was to continue to act on the\r\ndefensive; so, after the army had moved back to Halltown the\r\npreceding night, without loss or inconvenience, I called them in and\r\nposted them on the right of the infantry.\r\n\r\nMy retrograde move from Strasburg to Halltown caused considerable\r\nalarm in the North, as the public was ignorant of the reasons for it;\r\nand in the excited state of mind then prevailing, it was generally\r\nexpected that the reinforced Confederate army would again cross the\r\nPotomac, ravage Maryland and Pennsylvania, and possibly capture\r\nWashington.  Mutterings of dissatisfaction reached me from many\r\nsources, and loud calls were made for my removal, but I felt\r\nconfident that my course would be justified when the true situation\r\nwas understood, for I knew that I was complying with my instructions.\r\nTherefore I paid small heed to the adverse criticisms pouring down\r\nfrom the North almost every day, being fully convinced that the best\r\ncourse was to bide my time, and wait till I could get the enemy into\r\na position from which he could not escape without such serious\r\nmisfortune as to have some bearing on the general result of the war.\r\nIndeed, at this time I was hoping that my adversary would renew the\r\nboldness he had exhibited the early part of the month, and strike for\r\nthe north side of the Potomac, and wrote to General Grant on the 20th\r\nof August that I had purposely left everything in that direction open\r\nto the enemy.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d the Confederates moved to Charlestown and pushed well up\r\nto my position at Halltown.  Here for the next three days they\r\nskirmished with my videttes and infantry pickets, Emory and Cook\r\nreceiving the main attention; but finding that they could make no\r\nimpression, and judging it to be an auspicious time to intensify the\r\nscare in the North, on the 25th of August Early despatched Fitzhugh\r\nLee's cavalry to Williamsport, and moved all the rest of his army but\r\nAnderson's infantry and McCausland's cavalry to Kerneysville.  This\r\nsame day there was sharp picket firing along the whole front of my\r\ninfantry line, arising, as afterward ascertained, from a heavy\r\ndemonstration by Anderson.  During this firing I sent Torbert, with\r\nMerritt's and Wilson's divisions, to Kerrteysville, whence he was to\r\nproceed toward Leetown and learn what had become of Fitz. Lee.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile from Leetown Torbert met a small force of Confederate\r\ncavalry, and soon after encountering it, stumbled on Breckenridge's\r\ncorps of infantry on the march, apparently heading for Shepherdstown.\r\nThe surprise was mutual, for Torbert expected to meet only the\r\nenemy's cavalry, while the Confederate infantry column was\r\nanticipating an unobstructed march to the Potomac.  Torbert attacked\r\nwith such vigor as at first to double up the head of Breckenridge's\r\ncorps and throw it into confusion, but when the Confederates realized\r\nthat they were confronted only by cavalry, Early brought up the whole\r\nof the four infantry divisions engaged in his manoeuvre, and in a\r\nsharp attack pushed Torbert rapidly back.\r\n\r\nAll the advantages which Torbert had gained by surprising the enemy\r\nwere nullified by this counter-attack, and he was obliged to withdraw\r\nWilson's division toward my right, to the neighborhood of Duffield's\r\nStation, Merritt drawing back to the same point by way of the\r\nShepherdstown ford.  Custer's brigade becoming isolated after the\r\nfight while assisting the rear guard, was also obliged to retire,\r\nwhich it did to Shepherdstown and there halted, picketing the river\r\nto Antietam ford.\r\n\r\nWhen Torbert reported to me the nature of his encounter, and that a\r\npart of Early's infantry was marching to the north, while Fitzhugh\r\nLee's cavalry had gone toward Martinsburg, I thought that the\r\nConfederate general meditated crossing his cavalry into Maryland, so\r\nI sent Wilson by way of Harper's Ferry to watch his movements from\r\nBoonesboro', and at the same time directed Averell, who had reported\r\nfrom West Virginia some days before, to take post at Williamsport and\r\nhold the crossing there until he was driven away.  I also thought it\r\npossible that Early might cross the Potomac with his whole army, but\r\nthe doubts of a movement like this outweighed the probabilities\r\nfavoring it.  Nevertheless, to meet such a contingency I arranged to\r\nthrow my army on his rear should the occasion arise, and deeming my\r\nposition at Halltown the most advantageous in which to await\r\ndevelopments, my infantry was retained there.\r\n\r\nIf General Early had ever intended to cross the Potomac, Torbert's\r\ndiscovery of his manoeuvre put an end to his scheme of invasion, for\r\nhe well knew that and success he might derive from such a course\r\nwould depend on his moving with celerity, and keeping me in ignorance\r\nof his march till it should be well under way; so he settled all the\r\npresent uncertainties by retiring with all his troops about\r\nKerneysville to his old position at Bunker Hill behind the Opequon,\r\nand on the night of the 26th silently withdrew Anderson and\r\nMcCausland from my front at Halltown to Stephenson's depot.\r\n\r\nBy the 27th all of Early's infantry was in position at Brucetown and\r\nBunker Hill, his cavalry holding the outposts of Leetown and\r\nSmithfield, and on that day Merritt's division attacked the enemy's\r\nhorse at Leetown, and pressed it back through Smithfield to the west\r\nside of the Opequon.  This reconnoissance determined definitely that\r\nEarly had abandoned the projected movement into Maryland, if he ever\r\nseriously contemplated it; and I marched my infantry out from\r\nHalltown to the front of Charlestown, with the intention of occupying\r\na line between Clifton and Berryville the moment matters should so\r\nshape themselves that I could do so with advantage.  The night of the\r\n28th Wilson joined me near Charlestown from his points of observation\r\nin Maryland, and the next day Averell crossed the Potomac at\r\nWilliamsport and advanced to Martinsburg.\r\n\r\nMerritt's possession of Smithfield bridge made Early somewhat uneasy,\r\nsince it afforded opportunity for interposing a column between his\r\nright and left flanks, so he concluded to retake the crossing, and,\r\nto this end, on the 29th advanced two divisions of infantry.  A\r\nsevere fight followed, and Merritt was forced to retire, being driven\r\nthrough the village toward Charlestown with considerable loss.  As\r\nMerritt was nearing my infantry line, I ordered.  Ricketts's division\r\nof the Sixth Corps to his relief, and this in a few minutes turned\r\nthe tide, the Smithfield crossing of the Opequon being regained, and\r\nafterward held by Lowell's brigade, supported by Ricketts.  The next\r\nmorning I moved Torbert, with Wilson and Merritt, to Berryville, and\r\nsucceeding their occupation of that point there occurred along my\r\nwhole line a lull, which lasted until the 3d of September, being\r\nundisturbed except by a combat near Bunker Hill between Averell's\r\ncavalry and a part of McCausland's, supported by Rodes's division of\r\ninfantry, in which affair the Confederates were defeated with the\r\nloss of about fifty prisoners and considerable property in the shape\r\nof wagons and beef-cattle.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Torbert's movement to Berryville had alarmed Early, and as\r\na counter move on the 2d of September he marched with the bulk of his\r\narmy to Summit Point, but while reconnoitring in that region on the\r\n3d he learned of the havoc that Averell was creating in his rear, and\r\nthis compelled him to recross to the west side of the Opequon and\r\nmass his troops in the vicinity of Stephenson's depot, whence he\r\ncould extend down to Bunker Hill, continue to threaten the Baltimore\r\nand Ohio railroad, and at the same time cover Winchester.\r\n\r\nThe same day I was moving my infantry to take up the Clifton-Berryville\r\nline, and that afternoon Wright went into position at Clifton, Crook\r\noccupied Berryville, and Emory's corps came in between them, forming\r\nalmost a continuous line.  Torbert had moved to White Post meanwhile,\r\nwith directions to reconnoitre as far south as the Front Royal Pike.\r\n\r\nMy infantry had just got fairly into this position about an hour\r\nbefore sunset, when along Crook's front a combat took place that at\r\nthe time caused me to believe it was Early's purpose to throw a\r\ncolumn between Crook and Torbert, with the intention of isolating the\r\nlatter; but the fight really arose from the attempt of General\r\nAnderson to return to Petersburg with Kershaw's division in response\r\nto loud calls from General Lee.  Anderson started south on the 3d of\r\nSeptember, and possibly this explains Early's reconnoissance that day\r\nto Summit Point as a covering movement, but his rapid withdrawal left\r\nhim in ignorance of my advance, and Anderson marched on heedlessly\r\ntoward Berryville, expecting to cross the Blue Ridge through Ashby's\r\nGap.  At Berryville however, he blundered into Crook's lines about\r\nsunset, and a bitter little fight ensued, in which the Confederates\r\ngot so much the worst of it that they withdrew toward Winchester.\r\nWhen General Early received word of this encounter he hurried to\r\nAnderson's assistance with three divisions, but soon perceiving what\r\nwas hitherto unknown to him, that my whole army was on a new line, he\r\ndecided, after some slight skirmishing, that Anderson must remain at\r\nWinchester until a favorable opportunity offered for him to rejoin\r\nLee by another route.\r\n\r\nSucceeding the discomfiture of Anderson, some minor operations took\r\nplace on the part of, Averell on the right and McIntosh's brigade of\r\nWilson's division on the left, but from that time until the 19th of\r\nSeptember no engagement of much importance occurred.  The line from\r\nClifton to Berryville was occupied by the Sixth Corps and Grower's\r\nand Dwight's divisions of the Nineteenth, Crook being transferred to\r\nSummit Point, whence I could use him to protect my right flank and my\r\ncommunication with Harper's Ferry, while the cavalry threatened the\r\nenemy's right flank and line of retreat up the valley.\r\n\r\nThe difference of strength between the two armies at this date was\r\nconsiderably in my favor, but the conditions attending my situation\r\nin a hostile region necessitated so much detached service to protect\r\ntrains, and to secure Maryland and Pennsylvania from raids, that my\r\nexcess in numbers was almost canceled by these incidental demands\r\nthat could not be avoided, and although I knew that I was strong,\r\nyet, in consequence of the injunctions of General Grant, I deemed it\r\nnecessary to be very cautious; and the fact that the Presidential\r\nelection was impending made me doubly so, the authorities at\r\nWashington having impressed upon me that the defeat of my army might\r\nbe followed by the overthrow of the party in power, which event, it\r\nwas believed, would at least retard the progress of the war, if,\r\nindeed, it did not lead to the complete abandonment of all coercive\r\nmeasures.  Under circumstances such as these I could not afford to\r\nrisk a disaster, to say nothing of the intense disinclination every\r\nsoldier has for such results; so, notwithstanding my superior\r\nstrength, I determined to take all the time necessary to equip myself\r\nwith the fullest information, and then seize an opportunity under\r\nsuch conditions that I could not well fail of success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSONAL MEMOIRES OF P. H. SHERIDAN, VOLUME 2.\r\n\r\nBy Philip Henry Sheridan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nORGANIZING SCOUTS--MISS REBECCA WRIGHT--IMPORTANT INFORMATION--DECIDE\r\nTO MOVE ON NEWTOWN--MEETING GENERAL GRANT--ORGANIZATION OF THE UNION\r\nARMY--OPENING OF THE BATTLE OF THE OPEQUON--DEATH OF GENERAL RUSSELL\r\n--A TURNING MOVEMENT--A SUCCESSFUL CAVALRY CHARGE--VICTORY--THREE\r\nLOYAL GIRLS--APPOINTED A BRIGADIER-GENERAL IN THE REGULAR ARMY\r\n--REMARKS ON THE BATTLE.\r\n\r\nWhile occupying the ground between Clifton and Berryville, referred\r\nto in the last chapter of the preceding volume, I felt the need of an\r\nefficient body of scouts to collect information regarding the enemy,\r\nfor the defective intelligence-establishment with which I started out\r\nfrom Harper's Ferry early in August had not proved satisfactory.  I\r\ntherefore began to organize my scouts on a system which I hoped would\r\ngive better results than bad the method hitherto pursued in the\r\ndepartment, which was to employ on this service doubtful citizens and\r\nConfederate deserters.  If these should turn out untrustworthy, the\r\nmischief they might do us gave me grave apprehension, and I finally\r\nconcluded that those of our own soldiers who should volunteer for the\r\ndelicate and hazardous duty would be the most valuable material, and\r\ndecided that they should have a battalion organization and be\r\ncommanded by an officer, Major H. K. Young, of the First Rhode Island\r\nInfantry.  These men were disguised in Confederate uniforms whenever\r\nnecessary, were paid from the Secret-Service Fund in proportion to\r\nthe value of the intelligence they furnished, which often stood us in\r\ngood stead in checking the forays of Gilmore, Mosby, and other\r\nirregulars.  Beneficial results came from the plan in many other ways\r\ntoo, and particularly so when in a few days two of my scouts put me\r\nin the way of getting news conveyed from Winchester.  They had\r\nlearned that just outside of my lines, near Millwood, there was\r\nliving an old colored man, who had a permit from the Confederate\r\ncommander to go into Winchester and return three times a week, for\r\nthe purpose of selling vegetables to the inhabitants.  The scouts had\r\nsounded this man, and, finding him both loyal and shrewd, suggested\r\nthat he might be made useful to us within the enemy's lines; and the\r\nproposal struck me as feasible, provided there could be found in\r\nWinchester some reliable person who would be willing to co-operate\r\nand correspond with me.  I asked General Crook, who was acquainted\r\nwith many of the Union people of Winchester, if he knew of such a\r\nperson, and he recommended a Miss Rebecca Wright, a young lady whom\r\nhe had met there before the battle of Kernstown, who, he said, was a\r\nmember of the Society of Friends and the teacher of a small private\r\nschool.  He knew she was faithful and loyal to the Government, and\r\nthought she might be willing to render us assistance, but he could\r\nnot be certain of this, for on account of her well known loyalty she\r\nwas under constant surveillance.  I hesitated at first, but finally\r\ndeciding to try it, despatched the two scouts to the old negro's\r\ncabin, and they brought him to my headquarters late that night.  I\r\nwas soon convinced of the negro's fidelity, and asking him if he was\r\nacquainted with Miss Rebecca Wright, of Winchester, he replied that\r\nhe knew her well.  There upon I told him what I wished to do, and\r\nafter a little persuasion he agreed to carry a letter to her on his\r\nnext marketing trip.  My message was prepared by writing it on tissue\r\npaper, which was then compressed into a small pellet, and protected\r\nby wrapping it in tin-foil so that it could be safely carried in the\r\nman's mouth.  The probability, of his being searched when he came to\r\nthe Confederate picketline was not remote, and in such event he was\r\nto swallow the pellet.  The letter appealed to Miss Wright's loyalty\r\nand patriotism, and requested her to furnish me with information\r\nregarding the strength and condition of Early's army.  The night\r\nbefore the negro started one of the scouts placed the odd-looking\r\ncommunication in his hands, with renewed injunctions as to secrecy\r\nand promptitude.  Early the next morning it was delivered to Miss\r\nWright, with an intimation that a letter of importance was enclosed\r\nin the tin-foil, the negro telling her at the same time that she\r\nmight expect him to call for a message in reply before his return\r\nhome.  At first Miss Wright began to open the pellet nervously, but\r\nwhen told to be careful, and to preserve the foil as a wrapping for\r\nher answer, she proceeded slowly and carefully, and when the note\r\nappeared intact the messenger retired, remarking again that in the\r\nevening he would come for an answer.\r\n\r\nOn reading my communication Miss Wright was much startled by the\r\nperils it involved, and hesitatingly consulted her mother, but her\r\ndevoted loyalty soon silenced every other consideration, and the\r\nbrave girl resolved to comply with my request, notwithstanding it\r\nmight jeopardize her life.  The evening before a convalescent\r\nConfederate officer had visited her mother's house, and in\r\nconversation about the war had disclosed the fact that Kershaw's\r\ndivision of infantry and Cutshaw's battalion of artillery had started\r\nto rejoin General Lee.  At the time Miss Wright heard this she\r\nattached little if any importance to it, but now she perceived the\r\nvalue of the intelligence, and, as her first venture, determined to\r\nsend it to me at once, which she did with a promise that in the\r\nfuture she would with great pleasure continue to transmit information\r\nby the negro messenger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"SEPTEMBER 15, 1864.\r\n\r\n\"I learn from Major-General Crook that you are a loyal lady, and\r\nstill love the old flag.  Can you inform me of the position of\r\nEarly's forces, the number of divisions in his army, and the strength\r\nof any or all of them, and his probable or reported intentions?  Have\r\nany more troops arrived from Richmond, or are any more coming, or\r\nreported to be coming?\r\n\r\n\"You can trust the bearer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\"P. H. SHERIDAN, Major-General Commanding.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"SEPTEMBER 16, 1864.\r\n\r\n\"I have no communication whatever with the rebels, but will tell you\r\nwhat I know.  The division of General Kershaw, and Cutshaw's\r\nartillery, twelve guns and men, General Anderson commanding, have\r\nbeen sent away, and no more are expected, as they cannot be spared\r\nfrom Richmond.  I do not know how the troops are situated, but the\r\nforce is much smaller than represented.  I will take pleasure\r\nhereafter in learning all I can of their strength and position, and\r\nthe bearer may call again.\r\n\r\n\"Very respectfully yours,\"\r\n............\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Wright's answer proved of more value to me than she anticipated,\r\nfor it not only quieted the conflicting reports concerning Anderson's\r\ncorps, but was most important in showing positively that Kershaw was\r\ngone, and this circumstance led, three days later, to the battle of\r\nthe Opequon, or Winchester as it has been unofficially called.  Word\r\nto the effect that some of Early's troops were under orders to return\r\nto Petersburg, and would start back at the first favorable\r\nopportunity, had been communicated to me already from many sources,\r\nbut we had not been able to ascertain the date for their departure.\r\nNow that they had actually started, I decided to wait before offering\r\nbattle until Kershaw had gone so far as to preclude his return,\r\nfeeling confident that my prudence would be justified by the improved\r\nchances of victory; and then, besides, Mr. Stanton kept reminding me\r\nthat positive success was necessary to counteract the political\r\ndissatisfaction existing in some of the Northern States.  This course\r\nwas advised and approved by General Grant, but even with his powerful\r\nbacking it was difficult to resist the persistent pressure of those\r\nwhose judgment, warped by their interests in the Baltimore and Ohio\r\nrailroad, was often confused and misled by stories of scouts (sent\r\nout from Washington), averring that Kershaw and Fitzhugh Lee had\r\nreturned to Petersburg, Breckenridge to southwestern Virginia, and at\r\none time even maintaining that Early's whole army was east of the\r\nBlue Ridge, and its commander himself at Gordonsville.\r\n\r\nDuring the inactivity prevailing in my army for the ten days\r\npreceding Miss Wright's communication the infantry was quiet, with\r\nthe exception of Getty's division, which made a reconnoissance to the\r\nOpequon, and developed a heavy force of the enemy at Edwards's\r\nCorners.  The cavalry, however, was employed a good deal in this\r\ninterval skirmishing heavily at times to maintain a space about six\r\nmiles in width between the hostile lines, for I wished to control\r\nthis ground so that when I was released from the instructions of\r\nAugust 12, I could move my men into position for attack without the\r\nknowledge of Early.  The most noteworthy of these mounted encounters\r\nwas that of McIntosh's brigade, which captured the Eighth South\r\nCarolina at Abraham's Creek September 13.\r\n\r\nIt was the evening of the 16th of September that I received from Miss\r\nWright the positive information that Kershaw was in march toward\r\nFront Royal on his way by Chester Gap to Richmond.  Concluding that\r\nthis was my opportunity, I at once resolved to throw my whole force\r\ninto Newtown the next day, but a despatch from General Grant\r\ndirecting me to meet him at Charlestown, whither he was coming to\r\nconsult with me, caused me to defer action until after I should see\r\nhim.  In our resulting interview at Charlestown, I went over the\r\nsituation very thoroughly, and pointed out with so much confidence\r\nthe chances of a complete victory should I throw my army across the\r\nValley pike near Newtown that he fell in with the plan at once,\r\nauthorized me to resume the offensive, and to attack Early as soon as\r\nI deemed it most propitious to do so; and although before leaving\r\nCity Point he had outlined certain operations for my army, yet he\r\nneither discussed nor disclosed his plans, my knowledge of the\r\nsituation striking him as being so much more accurate than his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Extract from \"Grant's Memoirs,\" page 328.]\r\n\r\n\"....Before starting I had drawn up a plan of campaign for Sheridan,\r\nwhich I had brought with me; but seeing that he was so clear and so\r\npositive in his views, and so confident of success, I said nothing\r\nabout this, and did not take it out of my pocket....\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe interview over, I returned to my army to arrange for its movement\r\ntoward Newtown, but while busy with these preparations, a report came\r\nto me from General Averell which showed that Early was moving with\r\ntwo divisions of infantry toward Martinsburg.  This considerably\r\naltered the state of affairs, and I now decided to change my plan and\r\nattack at once the two divisions remaining about Winchester and\r\nStephenson's depot, and later, the two sent to Martinsburg; the\r\ndisjointed state of the enemy giving me an opportunity to take him in\r\ndetail, unless the Martinsburg column should be returned by forced\r\nmarches.\r\n\r\nWhile General Early was in the telegraph office at Martinsburg on the\r\nmorning of the 18th, he learned of Grant's visit to me; and\r\nanticipating activity by reason of this circumstance, he promptly\r\nproceeded to withdraw so as to get the two divisions within\r\nsupporting distance of Ramseur's, which lay across the Berryville\r\npike about two miles east of Winchester, between Abraham's Creek and\r\nRed Bud Run, so by the night of the 18th Wharton's division, under\r\nBreckenridge, was at Stephenson's depot, Rodes near there, and\r\nGordon's at Bunker Hill.  At daylight of the 19th these positions of\r\nthe Confederate infantry still obtained, with the cavalry of Lomax,\r\nJackson, and Johnson on the right of Ramseur, while to the left and\r\nrear of the enemy's general line was Fitzhugh Lee, covering from\r\nStephenson's depot west across the Valley pike to Applepie Ridge.\r\n\r\nMy army moved at 3 o'clock that morning.  The plan was for Torbert to\r\nadvance with Merritt's division of cavalry from Summit Point, carry\r\nthe crossings of the Opequon at Stevens's and Lock's fords, and form\r\na junction near Stephenson's depot, with Averell, who was to move\r\nsouth from Darksville by the Valley pike.  Meanwhile, Wilson was to\r\nstrike up the Berryville pike, carry the Berryville crossing of the\r\nOpequon, charge through the gorge or canyon on the road west of the\r\nstream, and occupy the open ground at the head of this defile.\r\nWilson's attack was to be supported by the Sixth and Nineteenth\r\ncorps, which were ordered to the Berryville crossing, and as the\r\ncavalry gained the open ground beyond the gorge, the two infantry\r\ncorps, under command of General Wright, were expected to press on\r\nafter and occupy Wilson's ground, who was then to shift to the south\r\nbank of Abraham's Creek and cover my left; Crook's two divisions,\r\nhaving to march from Summit Point, were to follow the Sixth and\r\nNineteenth corps to the Opcquon, and should they arrive before the\r\naction began, they were to be held in reserve till the proper moment\r\ncame, and then, as a turning-column, be thrown over toward the Valley\r\npike, south of Winchester.\r\n\r\nMcIntosh's brigade of Wilson's division drove the enemy's pickets\r\naway from the Berryville crossing at dawn, and Wilson following\r\nrapidly through the gorge with the rest of the division, debouched\r\nfrom its western extremity with such suddenness as to capture a\r\nsmall earthwork in front of General Ramseur's main line; and\r\nnot-withstanding the Confederate infantry, on recovering from its\r\nastonishment, tried hard to dislodge them, Wilson's troopers\r\nobstinately held the work till the Sixth Corps came up.  I followed\r\nWilson to select the ground on which to form the infantry.  The Sixth\r\nCorps began to arrive about 8 o'clock, and taking up the line Wilson\r\nhad been holding, just beyond the head of the narrow ravine, the\r\ncavalry was transferred to the south side of Abraham's Creek.\r\n\r\nThe Confederate line lay along some elevated ground about two miles\r\neast of Winchester, and extended from Abraham's Creek north across\r\nthe Berryville pike, the left being hidden in the heavy timber on Red\r\nBud Run.  Between this line and mine, especially on my right, clumps\r\nof woods and patches of underbrush occurred here and there, but the\r\nundulating ground consisted mainly of open fields, many of which were\r\ncovered with standing corn that had already ripened.\r\n\r\nMuch time was lost in getting all of the Sixth and Nineteenth corps\r\nthrough the narrow defile, Grover's division being greatly delayed\r\nthere by a train of ammunition wagons, and it was not until late in\r\nthe forenoon that the troops intended for the attack could be got\r\ninto line ready to advance.  General Early was not slow to avail\r\nhimself of the advantages thus offered him, and my chances of\r\nstriking him in detail were growing less every moment, for Gordon and\r\nRodes were hurrying their divisions from Stephenson's depot\r\n--across-country on a line that would place Gordon in the woods south\r\nof Red Bud Run, and bring Rodes into the interval between Gordon and\r\nRamseur.\r\n\r\nWhen the two corps had all got through the canyon they were formed\r\nwith Getty's division of the Sixth to the left of the Berryville\r\npike, Rickett's division to the right of the pike, and Russell's\r\ndivision in reserve in rear of the other two.  Grover's division of\r\nthe Nineteenth Corps came next on the right of Rickett's, with Dwight\r\nto its rear in reserve, while Crook was to begin massing near the\r\nOpequon crossing about the time Wright and Emory were ready to\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nJust before noon the line of Getty, Ricketts, and Grover moved\r\nforward, and as we advanced, the Confederates, covered by some heavy\r\nwoods on their right, slight underbrush and corn-fields along their\r\nCentre, and a large body of timber on their left along the Red Bud,\r\nopened fire from their whole front.  We gained considerable ground at\r\nfirst, especially on our left but the desperate resistance which the\r\nright met with demonstrated that the time we had unavoidably lost in\r\nthe morning had been of incalculable value to Early, for it was\r\nevident that he had been enabled already to so far concentrate his\r\ntroops as to have the different divisions of his army in a connected\r\nline of battle, in good shape to resist.\r\n\r\nGetty and Ricketts made some progress toward Winchester in connection\r\nwith Wilson's cavalry, which was beyond the Senseny road on Getty's\r\nleft, and as they were pressing back Ramseur's infantry and Lomax's\r\ncavalry Grover attacked from the right with decided effect.  Grover\r\nin a few minutes broke up Evans's brigade of Gordon's division, but\r\nhis pursuit of Evans destroyed the continuity of my general line, and\r\nincreased an interval that had already been made by the deflection of\r\nRicketts to the left, in obedience to instructions that had been\r\ngiven him to guide his division on the Berryville pike.  As the line\r\npressed forward, Ricketts observed this widening interval and\r\nendeavored to fill it with the small brigade of Colonel Keifer, but\r\nat this juncture both Gordon and Rodes struck the weak spot where the\r\nright of the Sixth Corps and the left of the Nineteenth should have\r\nbeen in conjunction, and succeeded in checking my advance by driving\r\nback a part of Ricketts's division, and the most of Grover's.  As\r\nthese troops were retiring I ordered Russell's reserve division to be\r\nput into action, and just as the flank of the enemy's troops in\r\npursuit of Grover was presented, Upton's brigade, led in person by\r\nboth Russell and Upton, struck it in a charge so vigorous as to drive\r\nthe Confederates back in turn to their original ground.\r\n\r\nThe success of Russell enabled me to re-establish the right of my\r\nline some little distance in advance of the position from which it\r\nstarted in the morning, and behind Russell's division (now commanded\r\nby Upton) the broken regiments of Ricketts's division were rallied.\r\nDwight's division was then brought up on the right, and Grover's men\r\nformed behind it.\r\n\r\nThe charge of Russell was most opportune, but it cost many men in\r\nkilled and wounded.  Among the former was the courageous Russell\r\nhimself; killed by a piece of shell that passed through his heart,\r\nalthough he had previously been struck by a bullet in the left\r\nbreast, which wound, from its nature, must have proved mortal, yet of\r\nwhich he had not spoken.  Russell's death oppressed us all with\r\nsadness, and me particularly.  In the early days of my army life he\r\nwas my captain and friend, and I was deeply indebted to him, not only\r\nfor sound advice and good example, but for the inestimable service he\r\nhad just performed, and sealed with his life, so it may be inferred\r\nhow keenly I felt his loss.\r\n\r\nAs my lines were being rearranged, it was suggested to me to put\r\nCrook into the battle, but so strongly had I set my heart on using\r\nhim to take possession of the Valley pike and cut off the enemy, that\r\nI resisted this advice, hoping that the necessity for putting him in\r\nwould be obviated by the attack near Stephenson's depot that\r\nTorbert's cavalry was to make, and from which I was momentarily\r\nexpecting to hear.  No news of Torbert's progress came, however, so,\r\nyielding at last, I directed Crook to take post on the right of the\r\nNineteenth Corps and, when the action was renewed, to push his\r\ncommand forward as a turning-column in conjunction with Emory.  After\r\nsome delay in the annoying defile, Crook got his men up, and posting\r\nColonel Thoburn's division on the prolongation of the Nineteenth\r\nCorps, he formed Colonel Duval's division to the right of Thoburn.\r\nHere I joined Crook, informing him that I had just got word that\r\nTorbert was driving the enemy in confusion along the Martinsburg pike\r\ntoward Winchester; at the same time I directed him to attack the\r\nmoment all of Duval's men were in line.  Wright was instructed to\r\nadvance in concert with Crook, by swinging Emory and the right of the\r\nSixth Corps to the left together in a half-wheel.  Then leaving\r\nCrook, I rode along the Sixth and Nineteenth corps, the open ground\r\nover which they were passing affording a rare opportunity to witness\r\nthe precision with which the attack was taken up from right to left.\r\nCrook's success began the moment he started to turn the enemy's left;\r\nand assured by the fact that Torbert had stampeded the Confederate\r\ncavalry and thrown Breckenridge's infantry into such disorder that it\r\ncould do little to prevent the envelopment of Gordon's left, Crook\r\npressed forward without even a halt.\r\n\r\nBoth Emory and Wright took up the fight as ordered, and as they did\r\nso I sent word to Wilson, in the hope that he could partly perform\r\nthe work originally laid out for Crook, to push along the Senseny\r\nroad and, if possible, gain the valley pike south of Winchester.  I\r\nthen returned toward my right flank, and as I reached the Nineteenth\r\nCorps the enemy was contesting the ground in its front with great\r\nobstinacy; but Emory's dogged persistence was at length rewarded with\r\nsuccess, just as Crook's command emerged from the morass of Red Bud\r\nRun, and swept around Gordon, toward the right of Breckenridge, who,\r\nwith two of Wharton's brigades, was holding a line at right angles\r\nwith the Valley pike for the protection of the Confederate rear.\r\nEarly had ordered these two brigades back from Stephenson's depot in\r\nthe morning, purposing to protect with them his right flank and line\r\nof retreat, but while they were en route to this end, he was obliged\r\nto recall them to his left to meet Crook's attack.\r\n\r\nTo confront Torbert, Patton's brigade of infantry and some of\r\nFitzhugh Lee's cavalry had been left back by Breckenridge, but, with\r\nAverell on the west side of the Valley pike and Merritt on the east,\r\nTorbert began to drive this opposing force toward Winchester the\r\nmoment he struck it near Stephenson's depot, keeping it on the go\r\ntill it reached the position held by Breckenridge, where it\r\nendeavored to make a stand.\r\n\r\nThe ground which Breckenridge was holding was open, and offered an\r\nopportunity such as seldom had been presented during the war for a\r\nmounted attack, and Torbert was not slow to take advantage of it.\r\nThe instant Merritt's division could be formed for the charge, it\r\nwent at Breckenridge's infantry and Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry with such\r\nmomentum as to break the Confederate left, just as Averell was\r\npassing around it.  Merritt's brigades, led by Custer, Lowell, and\r\nDevin, met from the start with pronounced success, and with sabre or\r\npistol in hand literally rode down a battery of five guns and took\r\nabout 1,200 prisoners.  Almost simultaneously with this cavalry\r\ncharge, Crook struck Breckenridge's right and Gordon's left, forcing\r\nthese divisions to give way, and as they retired, Wright, in a\r\nvigorous attack, quickly broke Rodes up and pressed Ramseur so hard\r\nthat the whole Confederate army fell back, contracting its lines\r\nwithin some breastworks which had been thrown up at a former period\r\nof the war, immediately in front of Winchester.\r\n\r\nHere Early tried hard to stem the tide, but soon Torbert's cavalry\r\nbegan passing around his left flank, and as Crook, Emory, and Wright\r\nattacked in front, panic took possession of the enemy, his troops,\r\nnow fugitives and stragglers, seeking escape into and through\r\nWinchester.\r\n\r\nWhen this second break occurred, the Sixth and Nineteenth corps were\r\nmoved over toward the Millwood pike to help Wilson on the left, but\r\nthe day was so far spent that they could render him no assistance,\r\nand Ramseur's division, which had maintained some organization, was\r\nin such tolerable shape as to check him.  Meanwhile Torbert passed\r\naround to the west of Winchester to join Wilson, but was unable to do\r\nso till after dark.  Crook's command pursued the enemy through the\r\ntown to Mill Greek, I going along.\r\n\r\nJust after entering the town, Crook and I met, in the main street,\r\nthree young girls, who gave us the most hearty reception.  One of\r\nthese young women was a Miss Griffith, the other two Miss Jennie and\r\nMiss Susie Meredith.  During the day they had been watching the\r\nbattle from the roof of the Meredith residence, with tears and\r\nlamentations, they said, in the morning when misfortune appeared to\r\nhave overtaken the Union troops, but with unbounded exultation when,\r\nlater, the tide set in against the Confederates.  Our presence was,\r\nto them, an assurance of victory, and their delight being\r\nirrepressible, they indulged in the most unguarded manifestations and\r\nexpressions.  When cautioned by Crook, who knew them well, and\r\nreminded that the valley had hitherto been a race-course--one day in\r\nthe possession of friends, and the next of enemies--and warned of the\r\ndangers they were incurring by such demonstrations, they assured him\r\nthat they had no further fears of that kind now, adding that Early's\r\narmy was so demoralized by the defeat it had just sustained that it\r\nwould never be in condition to enter Winchester again.  As soon as we\r\nhad succeeded in calming the excited girls a little I expressed a\r\ndesire to find some place where I could write a telegram to General\r\nGrant informing him of the result of the battle, and General Crook\r\nconducted me to the home of Miss Wright, where I met for the first\r\ntime the woman who had contributed so much to our success, and on a\r\ndesk in her school-room wrote the despatch announcing that we had\r\nsent Early's army whirling up the valley.\r\n\r\nMy losses in the battle of the Opequon were heavy, amounting to about\r\n4,500 killed, wounded, and missing.  Among the killed was General\r\nRussell, commanding a division, and the wounded included Generals\r\nUpton, McIntosh and Chapman, and Colonels Duval and Sharpe.  The\r\nConfederate loss in killed, wounded, and prisoners about equaled\r\nmine, General Rodes being of the killed, while Generals Fitzhugh Lee\r\nand York were severely wounded.\r\n\r\nWe captured five pieces of artillery and nine battle-flags.  The\r\nrestoration of the lower valley--from the Potomac to Strasburg--to\r\nthe control of the Union forces caused great rejoicing in the North,\r\nand relieved the Administration from further solicitude for the\r\nsafety of the Maryland and Pennsylvania borders.  The President's\r\nappreciation of the victory was expressed in a despatch so like Mr.\r\nLincoln that I give a facsimile of it to the reader:\r\n\r\n[In the handwriting of President Lincoln]\r\n\"EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT\r\n\"WASHINGTON, Sep.  20, 1864\r\n\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL SHERMAN\r\n\"WINCHESTER, VA.\r\n\r\n\"Have just heard of your great victory.  God bless you all, officers\r\nand men.  Strongly inclined to come up and see you.\r\n\r\n\"A. LINCOLN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis he supplemented by promoting me to the grade of\r\nbrigadier-general in the regular army, and assigning me to the\r\npermanent command of the Middle Military Department, and following that\r\ncame warm congratulations from Mr. Stanton and from Generals Grant,\r\nSherman, and Meade.\r\n\r\nThe battle was not fought out on the plan in accordance with which\r\nmarching orders were issued to my troops, for I then hoped to take\r\nEarly in detail, and with Crook's force cut off his retreat.  I\r\nadhered to this purpose during the early part of the contest, but was\r\nobliged to abandon the idea because of unavoidable delays by which I\r\nwas prevented from getting the Sixth and Nineteenth corps through the\r\nnarrow defile and into position early enough to destroy Ramseur while\r\nstill isolated.  So much delay had not been anticipated, and this\r\nloss of time was taken advantage of by the enemy to recall the troops\r\ndiverted to Bunker Hill and Martinsburg on the 17th, thus enabling\r\nhim to bring them all to the support of Ramseur before I could strike\r\nwith effect.  My idea was to attack Ramseur and Wharton,\r\nsuccessively, at a very early hour and before they could get succor,\r\nbut I was not in condition to do it till nearly noon, by which time\r\nGordon and Rodes had been enabled to get upon the ground at a point\r\nfrom which, as I advanced, they enfiladed my right flank, and gave it\r\nsuch a repulse that to re-form this part of my line I was obliged to\r\nrecall the left from some of the ground it had gained.  It was during\r\nthis reorganization of my lines that I changed my plan as to Crook,\r\nand moved him from my left to my right.  This I did with great\r\nreluctance, for I hoped to destroy Early's army entirely if Crook\r\ncontinued on his original line of march toward the Valley pike, south\r\nof Winchester; and although the ultimate results did, in a measure\r\nvindicate the change, yet I have always thought that by adhering to\r\nthe original plan we might have captured the bulk of Early's army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11.\r\n\r\nPURSUING EARLY--A SECRET MARCH--FISHER'S HILL--A GREAT SUCCESS\r\n--REMOVAL OF AVERELL--THE RETREAT--CAPTURING AN OLD COMRADE\r\n--THE MURDER OF LIEUTENANT MEIGS.\r\n\r\nThe night of the 19th of September I gave orders for following Early\r\nup the valley next morning--the pursuit to begin at daybreak--and in\r\nobedience to these directions Torbert moved Averell out on the Back\r\nroad leading to Cedar Creek, and Merritt up the Valley pike toward\r\nStrasburg, while Wilson was directed on Front Royal by way of\r\nStevensburg.  Merritt's division was followed by the infantry,\r\nEmory's and Wright's columns marching abreast in the open country to\r\nthe right and left of the pike, and Crook's immediately behind them.\r\nThe enemy having kept up his retreat at night, presented no\r\nopposition whatever until the cavalry discovered him posted at\r\nFisher's Hill, on the first defensive line where he could hope to\r\nmake any serious resistance.  No effort was made to dislodge him, and\r\nlater in the day, after Wright and Emory came up, Torbert shifted\r\nMerritt over toward the Back road till he rejoined Averell.  As\r\nMerritt moved to the right, the Sixth and Nineteenth corps crossed\r\nCedar Creek and took up the ground the cavalry was vacating, Wright\r\nposting his own corps to the west of the Valley pike overlooking\r\nStrasburg, and Emory's on his left so as to extend almost to the road\r\nleading from Strasburg to Front Royal.  Crook, as he came up the same\r\nevening, went into position in some heavy timber on the north bank of\r\nCedar Creek.\r\n\r\nA reconnoissance made pending these movements convinced me that the\r\nenemy's position at Fisher's Hill was so strong that a direct assault\r\nwould entail unnecessary destruction of life, and, besides, be of\r\ndoubtful result.  At the point where Early's troops were in position,\r\nbetween the Massanutten range and Little North Mountain, the valley\r\nis only about three and a half miles wide.  All along the precipitous\r\nbluff which overhangs Tumbling Run on the south side, a heavy line of\r\nearthworks had been constructed when Early retreated to this point in\r\nAugust, and these were now being strengthened so as to make them\r\nalmost impregnable; in fact, so secure did Early consider himself\r\nthat, for convenience, his ammunition chests were taken from the\r\ncaissons and placed behind the breastworks.  Wharton, now in command\r\nof Breckenridge's division--its late commander having gone to\r\nsouthwest Virginia--held the right of this line, with Gordon next\r\nhim; Pegram, commanding Ramseur's old division, joined Gordon.\r\nRamseur with Rodes's division, was on Pegram's left, while Lomax's\r\ncavalry, now serving as foot-troops, extended the line to the Back\r\nroad.  Fitzhugh Lee being wounded, his cavalry, under General\r\nWickham, was sent to Milford to prevent Fisher's Hill from being\r\nturned through the Luray Valley.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the enemy's being so well protected from a direct\r\nassault, I resolved on the night of the 20th to use again a\r\nturning-column against his left, as had been done on the 19th at the\r\nOpequon. To this end I resolved to move Crook, unperceived if possible,\r\nover to the eastern face of Little North Mountain, whence he could\r\nstrike the left and rear of the Confederate line, and as he broke it\r\nup, I could support him by a left half-wheel of my whole line of\r\nbattle. The execution of this plan would require perfect secrecy,\r\nhowever, for the enemy from his signal-station on Three Top could\r\nplainly see every movement of our troops in daylight.  Hence, to escape\r\nsuch observation, I marched Crook during the night of the 20th into\r\nsome heavy timber north of Cedar Creek, where he lay concealed all day\r\nthe 21st.  This same day Wright and Emory were moved up closer to the\r\nConfederate works, and the Sixth Corps, after a severe fight, in which\r\nRicketts's and Getty were engaged, took up some high ground on the\r\nright of the Manassas Gap railroad in plain view of the Confederate\r\nworks, and confronting a commanding point where much of Early's\r\nartillery was massed.  Soon after General Wright had established this\r\nline I rode with him along it to the westward, and finding that the\r\nenemy was still holding an elevated position further to our right, on\r\nthe north side of Tumbling Run, I directed this also to be occupied.\r\nWright soon carried the point, which gave us an unobstructed view of\r\nthe enemy's works and offered good ground for our artillery.  It also\r\nenabled me to move the whole of the Sixth Corps to the front till its\r\nline was within about seven hundred yards of the enemy's works; the\r\nNineteenth Corps, on the morning of the 22d, covering the ground\r\nvacated by the Sixth by moving to the front and extending to the right,\r\nbut still keeping its reserves on the railroad.\r\n\r\nIn the darkness of the night of the gist, Crook was brought across\r\nCedar Creek and hidden in a clump of timber behind Hupp's Hill till\r\ndaylight of the 22d, when, under cover of the intervening woods and\r\nravines, he was marched beyond the right of the Sixth Corps and again\r\nconcealed not far from the Back road.  After Crook had got into this\r\nlast position, Ricketts's division was pushed out until it confronted\r\nthe left of the enemy's infantry, the rest of the Sixth Corps\r\nextending from Ricketts's left to the Manassas Gap railroad, while\r\nthe Nineteenth Corps filled in the space between the left of the\r\nSixth and the North Fork of the Shenandoah.\r\n\r\nWhen Ricketts moved out on this new line, in conjunction with\r\nAverell's cavalry on his right, the enemy surmising, from information\r\nsecured from his signal-station, no doubt, that my attack was to be\r\nmade from Ricketts's front, prepared for it there, but no such\r\nintention ever existed.  Ricketts was pushed forward only that he\r\nmight readily join Crook's turning-column as it swung into the\r\nenemy's rear.  To ensure success, all that I needed now was enough\r\ndaylight to complete my arrangements, the secrecy of movement imposed\r\nby the situation consuming many valuable hours.\r\n\r\nWhile Ricketts was occupying the enemy's attention, Crook, again\r\nmoving unobserved into the dense timber on the eastern face of Little\r\nNorth Mountain, conducted his command south in two parallel columns\r\nuntil he gained the rear of the enemy's works, when, marching his\r\ndivisions by the left flank, he led them in an easterly direction\r\ndown the mountain-side.  As he emerged from the timber near the base\r\nof the mountain, the Confederates discovered him, of course, and\r\nopened with their batteries, but it was too late--they having few\r\ntroops at hand to confront the turning-column.  Loudly cheering,\r\nCrook's men quickly crossed the broken stretch in rear of the enemy's\r\nleft, producing confusion and consternation at every step.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile from the mountain's base Crook's left was joined by\r\nRicketts, who in proper time had begun to swing his division into the\r\naction, and the two commands moved along in rear of the works so\r\nrapidly that, with but slight resistance, the Confederates abandoned\r\nthe guns massed near the centre.  The swinging movement of Ricketts\r\nwas taken up successively from right to left throughout my line, and\r\nin a few minutes the enemy was thoroughly routed, the action, though\r\nbrief, being none the less decisive.  Lomax's dismounted cavalry gave\r\nway first, but was shortly followed by all the Confederate infantry\r\nin an indescribable panic, precipitated doubtless by fears of being\r\ncaught and captured in the pocket formed by Tumbling Run and the\r\nNorth Fork of the Shenandoah River.  The stampede was complete, the\r\nenemy leaving the field without semblance of organization, abandoning\r\nnearly all his artillery and such other property as was in the works,\r\nand the rout extending through the fields and over the roads toward\r\nWoodstock, Wright and Emory in hot pursuit.\r\n\r\nMidway between Fisher's Hill and Woodstock there is some high ground,\r\nwhere at night-fall a small squad endeavored to stay us with two\r\npieces of artillery, but this attempt at resistance proved fruitless,\r\nand, notwithstanding the darkness, the guns were soon captured.  The\r\nchase was then taken up by Devin's brigade as soon as it could be\r\npassed to the front, and continued till after daylight the next\r\nmorning, but the delays incident to a night pursuit made it\r\nimpossible for Devin to do more than pick up stragglers.\r\n\r\nOur success was very great, yet I had anticipated results still more\r\npregnant.  Indeed, I had high hopes of capturing almost the whole of\r\nEarly's army before it reached New Market, and with this object in\r\nview, during the manoeuvres of the 21st I had sent Torbert up the\r\nLuray Valley with Wilson's division and two of Merritt's brigades, in\r\nthe expectation that he would drive Wickham out of the Luray Pass by\r\nEarly's right, and by crossing the Massanutten Mountain near New\r\nMarket, gain his rear.  Torbert started in good season, and after\r\nsome slight skirmishing at Gooney Run, got as far as Milford, but\r\nfailed to dislodge Wickham.  In fact, he made little or no attempt to\r\nforce Wickham from his position, and with only a feeble effort\r\nwithdrew.  I heard nothing at all from Torbert during the 22d, and\r\nsupposing that everything was progressing favorably, I was astonished\r\nand chagrined on the morning of the 23d, at Woodstock, to receive the\r\nintelligence that he had fallen back to Front Royal and Buckton ford.\r\nMy disappointment was extreme, but there was now no help for the\r\nsituation save to renew and emphasize Torbert's orders, and this was\r\ndone at once, notwithstanding that I thought, the delay, had so much\r\ndiminished the chances of his getting in the rear of Early as to make\r\nsuch a result a very remote possibility, unless, indeed, far greater\r\nzeal was displayed than had been in the first attempt to penetrate\r\nthe Luray Valley.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Fisher's Hill was, in a measure, a part of the battle\r\nof the Opequon; that is to say, it was an incident of the pursuit\r\nresulting from that action.  In many ways, however, it was much more\r\nsatisfactory, and particularly so because the plan arranged on the\r\nevening of the 20th was carried out to the very letter by Generals\r\nWright, Crook, and Emory, not only in all their preliminary\r\nmanoeuvres, but also during the fight itself.  The only drawback was\r\nwith the cavalry, and to this day I have been unable to account\r\nsatisfactorily for Torbert's failure.  No doubt, Wickham's position\r\nnear Milford was a strong one, but Torbert ought to have made a\r\nfight.  Had he been defeated in this, his withdrawal then to await\r\nthe result at Fisher's Hill would have been justified, but it does\r\nnot appear that he made any serious effort of all to dislodge the\r\nConfederate cavalry: his impotent attempt not only chagrined me very\r\nmuch, but occasioned much unfavorable comment throughout the army.\r\n\r\nWe reached Woodstock early on the morning of the 23d, and halted\r\nthere some little time to let the troops recover their organization,\r\nwhich had been broken in the night march they had just made.  When\r\nthe commands had closed up we pushed on toward Edinburg, in the hope\r\nof making more captures at Narrow Passage Creek; but the\r\nConfederates, too fleet for us, got away; so General Wright halted\r\nthe infantry not far from Edinburg, till rations could be brought the\r\nmen.  Meanwhile I, having remained at Woodstock, sent Dedin's brigade\r\nto press the enemy under every favorable opportunity, and if possible\r\nprevent him from halting long enough to reorganize.  Notwithstanding\r\nDevin's efforts the Confederates managed to assemble a considerable\r\nforce to resist him, and being too weak for the rearguard, he awaited\r\nthe arrival of Averell, who, I had informed him, would be hurried to\r\nthe front with all possible despatch, for I thought that Averell must\r\nbe close at hand.  It turned out, however, that he was not near by at\r\nall, and, moreover, that without good reason he had refrained from\r\ntaking any part whatever in pursuing the enemy in the flight from\r\nFisher's Hill; and in fact had gone into camp and left to the\r\ninfantry the work of pursuit.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly noon when Averell came up, and a great deal of precious\r\ntime had been lost.  We had some hot words, but hoping that he would\r\nretrieve the mistake of the night before, I directed him to proceed\r\nto the front at once, and in conjunction with Devin close with the\r\nenemy.  He reached Devin's command about 3 o'clock in the afternoon,\r\njust as this officer was pushing the Confederates so energetically\r\nthat they were abandoning Mount Jackson, yet Averell utterly failed\r\nto accomplish anything.  Indeed, his indifferent attack was not at\r\nall worthy the excellent soldiers he commanded, and when I learned\r\nthat it was his intention to withdraw from the enemy's front, and\r\nthis, too, on the indefinite report of a signal-officer that a\r\n\"brigade or division\" of Confederates was turning his right flank,\r\nand that he had not seriously attempted to verify the information, I\r\nsent him this order:\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,\r\n\"Woodstock, Va., Sept.  23, 1864\r\n\r\n\"BREVET MAJOR-GENERAL AVERELL\r\n\r\n\"Your report and report of signal-officer received.  I do not want\r\nyou to let the enemy bluff you or your command, and I want you to\r\ndistinctly understand this note.  I do not advise rashness, but I do\r\ndesire resolution and actual fighting, with necessary casualties,\r\nbefore you retire.  There must now be no backing or filling by you\r\nwithout a superior force of the enemy actually engaging you.\r\n\r\n\"P. H. SHERIDAN,\r\n\"Major-General Commanding.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSome little time after this note went to Averell, word was brought me\r\nthat he had already carried out the programme indicated when\r\nforwarding the report of the expected turning of his right, and that\r\nhe had actually withdrawn and gone into camp near Hawkinsburg.  I\r\nthen decided to relieve him from the command of his division, which I\r\ndid, ordering him to Wheeling, Colonel William H. Powell being\r\nassigned to succeed him.\r\n\r\nThe removal of Averell was but the culmination of a series of events\r\nextending back to the time I assumed command of the Middle Military\r\nDivision.  At the outset, General Grant, fearing discord on account\r\nof Averell's ranking Torbert, authorized me to relieve the former\r\nofficer, but I hoped that if any trouble of this sort arose, it could\r\nbe allayed, or at least repressed, during the campaign against Early,\r\nsince the different commands would often have to act separately.\r\nAfter that, the dispersion of my army by the return of the Sixth\r\nCorps and Torbert's cavalry to the Army of the Potomac would take\r\nplace, I thought, and this would restore matters to their normal\r\ncondition; but Averell's dissatisfaction began to show itself\r\nimmediately after his arrival at Martinsburg, on the 14th of August,\r\nand, except when he was conducting some independent expedition, had\r\nbeen manifested on all occasions since.  I therefore thought that the\r\ninterest of the service would be subserved by removing one whose\r\ngrowing indifference might render the best-laid plans inoperative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION.\r\n\"HARRISONBURG, VA., SEPT.  25, 1864 11:30 P. M.\r\n\"LIEUT-GENERAL GRANT, Comd'g, City Point, Va.\r\n\r\n\"I have relieved Averell from his command.  Instead of following the\r\nenemy when he was broken at Fisher's Hill (so there was not a cavalry\r\norganization left), he went into camp and let me pursue the enemy for\r\na distance of fifteen miles, with infantry, during the night.\r\n\r\n\"P. H. SHERIDAN, Major-General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe failure of Averell to press the enemy the evening of the 23d gave\r\nEarly time to collect his scattered forces and take up a position on\r\nthe east side of the North Fork of the Shenandoah, his left resting\r\non the west side of that stream at Rude's Hill, a commanding point\r\nabout two miles south of Mt. Jackson.  Along this line he had\r\nconstructed some slight works during the night, and at daylight on\r\nthe 24th, I moved the Sixth and Nineteenth corps through Mt. Jackson\r\nto attack him, sending Powell's division to pass around his left\r\nflank, toward Timberville, and Devin's brigade across the North Fork,\r\nto move along the base of Peaked Ridge and attack his right.  The\r\ncountry was entirely open, and none of these manoeuvres could be\r\nexecuted without being observed, so as soon as my advance began, the\r\nenemy rapidly retreated in line of battle up the valley through New\r\nMarket, closely followed by Wright and Emory, their artillery on the\r\npike and their columns on its right and left.  Both sides moved with\r\ncelerity, the Confederates stimulated by the desire to escape, and\r\nour men animated by the prospect of wholly destroying Early's army.\r\nThe stern-chase continued for about thirteen miles, our infantry\r\noften coming within range, yet whenever we began to deploy, the\r\nConfederates increased the distance between us by resorting to a\r\ndouble quick, evading battle with admirable tact.  While all this was\r\ngoing on, the open country permitted us a rare and brilliant sight,\r\nthe bright sun gleaming from the arms and trappings of the thousands\r\nof pursuers and pursued.\r\n\r\nNear New Market, as a last effort to hold the enemy, I pushed Devin's\r\ncavalry--comprising about five hundred men--with two guns right up on\r\nEarly's lines, in the hope that the tempting opportunity given him to\r\ncapture the guns would stay his retreat long enough to let my\r\ninfantry deploy within range, but he refused the bait, and after\r\nmomentarily checking Devin he continued on with little loss and in\r\npretty good order.\r\n\r\nAll hope of Torbert's appearing in rear of the Confederates vanished\r\nas they passed beyond New Market.  Some six miles south of this place\r\nEarly left the Valley Pike and took the road to Keezletown, a move\r\ndue in a measure to Powell's march by way of Timberville toward\r\nLacy's Springs, but mainly caused by the fact that the Keezletown\r\nroad ran immediately along the base of Peaked Mountain--a rugged\r\nridge affording protection to Early's right flank--and led in a\r\ndirection facilitating his junction with Kershaw, who had been\r\nordered back to him from Culpeper the day after the battle of the\r\nOpequon.  The chase was kept up on the Keezeltown road till darkness\r\novertook us, when my weary troops were permitted to go into camp; and\r\nas soon as the enemy discovered by our fires that the pursuit had\r\nstopped, he also bivouacked some five miles farther south toward Port\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Early was joined by Lomax's cavalry from\r\nHarrisonburg, Wickham's and Payne's brigades of cavalry also uniting\r\nwith him from the Luray Valley.  His whole army then fell back to the\r\nmouth of Brown's Gap to await Kershaw's division and Cutshaw's\r\nartillery, now on their return.\r\n\r\nBy the morning of the 25th the main body of the enemy had disappeared\r\nentirely from my front, and the capture of some small, squads of\r\nConfederates in the neighboring hills furnished us the only incidents\r\nof the day.  Among the prisoners was a tall and fine looking officer,\r\nmuch worn with hunger and fatigue.  The moment I saw him I recognized\r\nhim as a former comrade, George W. Carr, with whom I had served in\r\nWashington Territory.  He was in those days a lieutenant in the Ninth\r\nInfantry, and was one of the officers who superintended the execution\r\nof the nine Indians at the Cascades of the Columbia in 1856.  Carr\r\nwas very much emaciated, and greatly discouraged by the turn events\r\nhad recently taken.  For old acquaintance sake I gave him plenty to\r\neat, and kept him in comfort at my headquarters until the next batch\r\nof prisoners was sent to the rear, when he went with them.  He had\r\nresigned from the regular army at the commencement of hostilities,\r\nand, full of high anticipation, cast his lot with the Confederacy,\r\nbut when he fell into our hands, his bright dreams having been\r\ndispelled by the harsh realities of war, he appeared to think that\r\nfor him there was no future.\r\n\r\nPicking up prisoners here and there, my troops resumed their march\r\ndirectly south on the Valley pike, and when the Sixth and Nineteenth\r\ncorps reached Harrisonburg, they went into camp, Powell in the\r\nmeanwhile pushing on to Mt. Crawford, and Crook taking up a position\r\nin our rear at the junction of the Keezletown road and the Valley\r\npike.  Late in the afternoon Torbert's cavalry came in from New\r\nMarket arriving at that place many hours later than it had been\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nThe succeeding day I sent Merritt to Port Republic to occupy the\r\nenemy's attention, while Torbert, with Wilson's division and the\r\nregular brigade, was ordered to Staunton, whence he was to proceed to\r\nWaynesboro' and blow up the railroad bridge.  Having done this,\r\nTorbert, as he returned, was to drive off whatever cattle he could\r\nfind, destroy all forage and breadstuffs, and burn the mills.  He\r\ntook possession of Waynesboro' in due time, but had succeeded in only\r\npartially demolishing the railroad bridge when, attacked by Pegram's\r\ndivision of infantry and Wickham's cavalry, he was compelled to fall\r\nback to Staunton.  From the latter place he retired to Bridgewater,\r\nand Spring Hill, on the way, however, fully executing his\r\ninstructions regarding the destruction of supplies.\r\n\r\nWhile Torbert was on this expedition, Merritt had occupied Port\r\nRepublic, but he happened to get there the very day that Kershaw's\r\ndivision was marching from Swift Run Gap to join Early.  By accident\r\nKershaw ran into Merritt shortly after the latter had gained the\r\nvillage.  Kershaw's four infantry brigades attacked at once, and\r\nMerrit, forced out of Port Republic, fell back toward Cross Keys; and\r\nin anticipation that the Confederates could be coaxed to that point,\r\nI ordered the infantry there, but Torbert's attack at Wavnesboro' had\r\nalarmed Early, and in consequence he drew all his forces in toward\r\nRock-fish Gap.  This enabled me to re-establish Merritt at Port\r\nRepublic, send the Sixth and Nineteenth corps to the neighborhood of\r\nMt. Crawford to await the return of Torbert, and to post Crook at\r\nHarrisonburg; these dispositions practically obtained till the 6th of\r\nOctober, I holding a line across the valley from Port Republic along\r\nNorth River by Mt. Crawford to the Back road near the mouth of Briery\r\nBranch Gap.\r\n\r\nIt was during this period, about dusk on the evening of October 3,\r\nthat between Harrisonburg and Dayton my engineer officer, Lieutenant\r\nJohn R. Meigs, was murdered within my lines.  He had gone out with\r\ntwo topographical assistants to plot the country, and late in the\r\nevening, while riding along the public road on his return to camp, he\r\novertook three men dressed in our uniform.  From their dress, and\r\nalso because the party was immediately behind our lines and within a\r\nmile and a half of my headquarters, Meigs and his assistants\r\nnaturally thought that they were joining friends, and wholly\r\nunsuspicious of anything to the contrary, rode on with the three men\r\nsome little distance; but their perfidy was abruptly discovered by\r\ntheir suddenly turning upon Meigs with a call for his surrender.  It\r\nhas been claimed that, refusing to submit, he fired on the\r\ntreacherous party, but the statement is not true, for one of the\r\ntopographers escaped--the other was captured--and reported a few\r\nminutes later at my headquarters that Meigs was killed without\r\nresistance of any kind whatever, and without even the chance to give\r\nhimself up.  This man was so cool, and related all the circumstances\r\nof the occurrence with such exactness, as to prove the truthfulness\r\nof his statement.  The fact that the murder had been committed inside\r\nour lines was evidence that the perpetrators of the crime, having\r\ntheir homes in the vicinity, had been clandestinely visiting them,\r\nand been secretly harbored by some of the neighboring residents.\r\nDetermining to teach a lesson to these abettors of the foul deed--a\r\nlesson they would never forget--I ordered all the houses within an\r\narea of five miles to be burned.  General Custer, who had succeeded\r\nto the command of the Third Cavalry division (General Wilson having\r\nbeen detailed as chief of cavalry to Sherman's army), was charged\r\nwith this duty, and the next morning proceeded to put the order into\r\nexecution.  The prescribed area included the little village of\r\nDayton, but when a few houses in the immediate neighborhood of the\r\nscene of the murder had been burned, Custer was directed to cease his\r\ndesolating work, but to fetch away all the able-bodied males as\r\nprisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nREASONS FOR NOT PURSUING EARLY THROUGH THE BLUE RIDGE--GENERAL\r\nTORBERT DETAILED TO GIVE GENERAL ROSSER A \"DRUBBING\"--GENERAL ROSSER\r\nROUTED--TELEGRAPHED TO MEET STANTON--LONGSTREET'S MESSAGE--RETURN TO\r\nWINCHESTER--THE RIDE TO CEDAR CREEK--THE RETREATING ARMY--RALLYING\r\nTHE TROOPS--REFORMING THE LINE--COMMENCING THE ATTACK--DEFEAT OF THE\r\nCONFEDERATES--APPOINTED A MAJOR-GENERAL IN THE REGULAR ARMY--RESULTS\r\nOF THE BATTLE.\r\n\r\nWhile we lay in camp at Harrisonburg it became necessary to decide\r\nwhether or not I would advance to Brown's Gap, and, after driving the\r\nenemy from there, follow him through the Blue Ridge into eastern\r\nVirginia.  Indeed, this question began to cause me solicitude as soon\r\nas I knew Early had escaped me at New Market, for I felt certain that\r\nI should be urged to pursue the Confederates toward Charlottesville\r\nand Gordonsville, and be expected to operate on that line against\r\nRichmond.  For many reasons I was much opposed to such a plan, but\r\nmainly because its execution would involve the opening of the Orange\r\nand Alexandria railroad.  To protect this road against the raids of\r\nthe numerous guerrilla bands that infested the region through which\r\nit passed, and to keep it in operation, would require a large force\r\nof infantry, and would also greatly reduce my cavalry; besides, I\r\nshould be obliged to leave a force in the valley strong enough to\r\ngive security to the line of the upper Potomac and the Baltimore and\r\nOhio railroad, and this alone would probably take the whole of\r\nCrook's command, leaving me a wholly inadequate number of fighting\r\nmen to prosecute a campaign against the city of Richmond.  Then, too,\r\nI was in doubt whether the besiegers could hold the entire army at\r\nPetersburg; and in case they could not, a number of troops sufficient\r\nto crush me might be detached by Lee, moved rapidly by rail, and,\r\nafter overwhelming me, be quickly returned to confront General Meade.\r\nI was satisfied, moreover, that my transportation could not supply me\r\nfurther than Harrisonburg, and if in penetrating the Blue Ridge I met\r\nwith protracted resistance, a lack of supplies might compel me to\r\nabandon the attempt at a most inopportune time.\r\n\r\nI therefore advised that the Valley campaign be terminated north of\r\nStaunton, and I be permitted to return, carrying out on the way my\r\noriginal instructions for desolating the Shenandoah country so as to\r\nmake it untenable for permanent occupation by the Confederates.  I\r\nproposed to detach the bulk of my army when this work of destruction\r\nwas completed, and send it by way of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad\r\nthrough Washington to the Petersburg line, believing that I could\r\nmove it more rapidly by that route than by any other.  I was\r\nconfident that if a movement of this character could be made with\r\ncelerity it would culminate in the capture of Richmond and possibly\r\nof General Lee's army, and I was in hopes that General Grant would\r\ntake the same view of the matter; but just at this time he was so\r\npressed by the Government and by public-opinion at the North, that he\r\nadvocated the wholly different conception of driving Early into\r\neastern Virginia, and adhered to this plan with some tenacity.\r\nConsiderable correspondence regarding the subject took place between\r\nus, throughout which I stoutly maintained that we should not risk, by\r\nwhat I held to be a false move, all that my army had gained.  I being\r\non the ground, General Grant left to me the final decision of the\r\nquestion, and I solved the first step by determining to withdraw down\r\nthe valley at least as far as Strasburg, which movement was begun on\r\nthe 6th of October.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry as it retired was stretched across the country from the\r\nBlue Ridge to the eastern slope of the Alleghanies, with orders to\r\ndrive off all stock and destroy all supplies as it moved northward.\r\nThe infantry preceded the cavalry, passing down the Valley pike, and\r\nas we marched along the many columns of smoke from burning stacks,\r\nand mills filled with grain, indicated that the adjacent country was\r\nfast losing the features which hitherto had made it a great magazine\r\nof stores for the Confederate armies.\r\n\r\nDuring the 6th and 7th of October, the enemy's horse followed us up,\r\nthough at a respectful distance.  This cavalry was now under command\r\nof General T. W. Rosser, who on October 5 had joined Early with an\r\nadditional brigade from Richmond.  As we proceeded the Confederates\r\ngained confidence, probably on account of the reputation with which\r\nits new commander had been heralded, and on the third day's march had\r\nthe temerity to annoy my rear guard considerably.  Tired of these\r\nannoyances, I concluded to open the enemy's eyes in earnest, so that\r\nnight I told Torbert I expected him either to give Rosser a drubbing\r\nnext morning or get whipped himself, and that the infantry would be\r\nhalted until the affair was over; I also informed him that I proposed\r\nto ride out to Round Top Mountain to see the fight.  When I decided\r\nto have Rosser chastised, Merritt was encamped at the foot of Round\r\nTop, an elevation just north of Tom's Brook, and Custer some six\r\nmiles farther north and west, near Tumbling Run.  In the night Custer\r\nwas ordered to retrace his steps before daylight by the Back road,\r\nwhich is parallel to and about three miles from the Valley pike, and\r\nattack the enemy at Tom's Brook crossing, while Merritt's\r\ninstructions were to assail him on the Valley pike in concert with\r\nCuster.  About 7 in the morning, Custer's division encountered Rosser\r\nhimself with three brigades, and while the stirring sounds of the\r\nresulting artillery duel were reverberating through the valley\r\nMerritt moved briskly to the front and fell upon Generals Lomax and\r\nJohnson on the Valley pike.  Merritt, by extending his right, quickly\r\nestablished connection with Custer, and the two divisions moved\r\nforward together under Torbert's direction, with a determination to\r\ninflict on the enemy the sharp and summary punishment his rashness\r\nhad invited.\r\n\r\nThe engagement soon became general across the valley, both sides\r\nfighting mainly mounted.  For about two hours the contending lines\r\nstruggled with each other along Tom's Brook, the charges and counter\r\ncharges at many points being plainly visible from the summit of Round\r\nTop, where I had my headquarters for the time.\r\n\r\nThe open country permitting a sabre fight, both sides seemed bent on\r\nusing that arm.  In the centre the Confederates maintained their\r\nposition with much stubbornness, and for a time seemed to have\r\nrecovered their former spirit, but at last they began to give way on\r\nboth flanks, and as these receded, Merritt and Custer went at the\r\nwavering ranks in a charge along the whole front.  The result was a\r\ngeneral smash-up of the entire Confederate line, the retreat quickly\r\ndegenerating into a rout the like of which was never before seen.\r\nFor twenty-six miles this wild stampede kept up, with our troopers\r\nclose at the enemy's heels; and the ludicrous incidents of the chase\r\nnever ceased to be amusing topics around the camp-fires of Merritt\r\nand Custer.  In the fight and pursuit Torbert took eleven pieces of\r\nartillery, with their caissons, all the wagons and ambulances the\r\nenemy had on the ground, and three hundred prisoners.  Some of\r\nRosser's troopers fled to the mountains by way of Columbia Furnace,\r\nand some up the Valley pike and into the Massamitten Range,\r\napparently not discovering that the chase had been discontinued till\r\nsouth of Mount Jackson they rallied on Early's infantry.\r\n\r\nAfter this catastrophe, Early reported to General Lee that his\r\ncavalry was so badly demoralized that it should be dismounted; and\r\nthe citizens of the valley, intensely disgusted with the boasting and\r\nswaggering that had characterized the arrival of the \"Laurel Brigade\"\r\nin that section, baptized the action (known to us as Tom's Brook) the\r\n\"Woodstock Races,\" and never tired of poking fun at General Rosser\r\nabout his precipitate and inglorious flight.  (When Rosser arrived\r\nfrom Richmond with his brigade he was proclaimed as the savior of the\r\nValley, and his men came all bedecked with laurel branches.)\r\n\r\nOn the 10th my army, resuming its retrograde movement, crossed to the\r\nnorth side of Cedar Creek.  The work of repairing the Manassas Gap\r\nbranch of the Orange and Alexandria railroad had been begun some days\r\nbefore, out from Washington, and, anticipating that it would be in\r\nreadiness to transport troops by the time they could reach Piedmont,\r\nI directed the Sixth Corps to continue its march toward Front Royal,\r\nexpecting to return to the Army of the Potomac by that line.  By the\r\n12th, however, my views regarding the reconstruction of this railroad\r\nbegan to prevail, and the work on it was discontinued.  The Sixth\r\nCorps, therefore, abandoned that route, and moved toward Ashby's Gap\r\nwith the purpose of marching direct to Washington, but on the 13th I\r\nrecalled it to Cedar Creek, in consequence of the arrival of the\r\nenemy's infantry at Fisher's Hill, and the receipt, the night before,\r\nof the following despatch, which again opened the question of an\r\nadvance on Gordonsville and Charlottesville:\r\n\r\n\r\n(Cipher.)\r\n\"WASHINGTON, October 12, 1864, 12 M.\r\n\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN:\r\n\r\n\"Lieutenant-General Grant wishes a position taken far enough south to\r\nserve as a base for further operations upon Gordonsville and\r\nCharlottesville.  It must be strongly fortified and provisioned.\r\nSome point in the vicinity of Manassas Gap would seem best suited for\r\nall purposes.  Colonel Alexander, of the Engineers, will be sent to\r\nconsult with you as soon as you connect with General Augur.\r\n\r\n\"H.  W.  HALLECK, Major-General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs it was well known in Washington that the views expressed in the\r\nabove despatch were counter to my convictions, I was the next day\r\nrequired by the following telegram from Secretary Stanton to repair\r\nto that city:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"WASHINGTON, October 13, 1864.\r\n\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN\r\n(through General Augur)\r\n\r\n\"If you can come here, a consultation on several points is extremely\r\ndesirable.  I propose to visit General Grant, and would like to see\r\nyou first.\r\n\r\n\"EDWIN M.  STANTON,\r\n\"Secretary of War.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI got all ready to comply with the terms of Secretary Stanton's\r\ndespatch, but in the meantime the enemy appeared in my front in\r\nforce, with infantry and cavalry, and attacked Colonel Thoburn, who\r\nhad been pushed out toward Strasburg from Crook's command, and also\r\nCuster's division of cavalry on the Back road.  As afterward\r\nappeared, this attack was made in the belief that all of my troops\r\nbut Crook's had gone to Petersburg.  From this demonstration there\r\nensued near Hupp's Hill a bitter skirmish between Kershaw and\r\nThoburn, and the latter was finally compelled to withdraw to the\r\nnorth bank of Cedar Creek.  Custer gained better results, however, on\r\nthe Back road, with his usual dash driving the enemy's cavalry away\r\nfrom his front, Merritt's division then joining him and remaining on\r\nthe right.\r\n\r\nThe day's events pointing to a probability that the enemy intended to\r\nresume the offensive, to anticipate such a contingency I ordered the\r\nSixth Corps to return from its march toward Ashby's Gap.  It reached\r\nme by noon of the 14th, and went into position to the right and rear\r\nof the Nineteenth Corps, which held a line along the north bank of\r\nCedar Creek, west of the Valley pike.  Crook was posted on the left\r\nof the Nineteenth Corps and east of the Valley pike, with Thoburn's\r\ndivision advanced to a round hill, which commanded the junction of\r\nCedar Creek and the Shenandoah River, while Torbert retained both\r\nMerritt and Custer on the right of the Sixth Corps, and at the\r\nsame time covered with Powell the roads toward Front Royal.  My\r\nhead-quarters were at the Belle Grove House, which was to the west of\r\nthe pike and in rear of the Nineteenth Corps.  It was my intention to\r\nattack the enemy as soon as the Sixth Corps reached me, but General\r\nEarly having learned from his demonstration that I had not detached as\r\nlargely as his previous information had led him to believe, on the\r\nnight of the 13th withdrew to Fisher's Hill; so, concluding that he\r\ncould not do us serious hurt from there, I changed my mind as to\r\nattacking, deciding to defer such action till I could get to\r\nWashington, and come to some definite understanding about my future\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nTo carry out this idea, on the evening of the 15th I ordered all of\r\nthe cavalry under General Torbert to accompany me to Front Royal,\r\nagain intending to push it thence through Chester Gap to the Virginia\r\nCentral railroad at Charlottesville, to destroy the bridge over the\r\nRivanna River, while I passed through Manassas Gap to Rectortown, and\r\nthence by rail to Washington.  On my arrival with the cavalry near\r\nFront Royal on the 16th, I halted at the house of Mrs. Richards, on\r\nthe north bank of the river, and there received the following\r\ndespatch and inclosure from General Wright, who had been left in\r\ncommand at Cedar Creek:\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY Division,\r\n\"October 16, 1864.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL:\r\n\r\n\"I enclose you despatch which explains itself.  If the enemy should\r\nbe strongly reenforced in cavalry, he might, by turning our right,\r\ngive us a great deal of trouble.  I shall hold on here until the\r\nenemy's movements are developed, and shall only fear an attack on my\r\nright, which I shall make every preparation for guarding against and\r\nresisting.\r\n\r\n\"Very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\"H.  G.  WRIGHT, Major-General Commanding.\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN,\r\n\"Commanding Middle Military Division.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[INCLOSURE.] \"To LIEUTENANT-GENERAL EARLY:\r\n\r\n\"Be ready to move as soon as my forces join you, and we will crush\r\nSheridan.\r\n\r\n\"LONGSTREET, Lieutenant-General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe message from Longstreet had been taken down as it was being\r\nflagged from the Confederate signal-station on Three Top Mountain,\r\nand afterward translated by our signal officers, who knew the\r\nConfederate signal code.  I first thought it a ruse, and hardly worth\r\nattention, but on reflection deemed it best to be on the safe side,\r\nso I abandoned the cavalry raid toward Charlottesville, in order to\r\ngive General Wright the entire strength of the army, for it did not\r\nseem wise to reduce his numbers while reinforcement for the enemy\r\nmight be near, and especially when such pregnant messages were\r\nreaching Early from one of the ablest of the Confederate generals.\r\nTherefore I sent the following note to General Wright:\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,\r\n\"Front Royal, October 16, 1864.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL: The cavalry is all ordered back to you; make your position\r\nstrong.  If Longstreet's despatch is true, he is under the impression\r\nthat we have largely detached.  I will go over to Augur, and may get\r\nadditional news.  Close in Colonel Powell, who will be at this point.\r\nIf the enemy should make an advance, I know you will defeat him.\r\nLook well to your ground and be well prepared.  Get up everything\r\nthat can be spared.  I will bring up all I can, and will be up on\r\nTuesday, if not sooner.\r\n\r\n\"P. H. SHERIDAN, Major-General.\r\n\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL H.  G.  WRIGHT,\r\n\"Commanding Sixth Army Corps.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAt 5 o'clock on the evening of the 16th I telegraphed General Halleck\r\nfrom Rectortown, giving him the information which had come to me from\r\nWright, asking if anything corroborative of it had been received from\r\nGeneral Grant, and also saying that I would like to see Halleck; the\r\ntelegram ending with the question: \"Is it best for me to go to see\r\nyou?\"  Next morning I sent back to Wright all the cavalry except one\r\nregiment, which escorted me through Manassas Gap to the terminus of\r\nthe railroad from Washington.  I had with me Lieutenant-Colonel James\r\nW.  Forsyth, chief-of-staff, and three of my aides, Major George A.\r\nForsyth, Captain Joseph O'Keefe, and Captain Michael V. Sheridan.  I\r\nrode my black horse, Rienzi, and the others their own respective\r\nmounts.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Cedar Creek I had fixed the route of my return to be\r\nby rail from Washington to Martinsburg, and thence by horseback to\r\nWinchester and Cedar Creek, and had ordered three hundred cavalry to\r\nMartinsburg to escort me from that point to the front.  At Rectortown\r\nI met General Augur, who had brought a force out from Washington to\r\nreconstruct and protect the line of railroad, and through him\r\nreceived the following reply from General Halleck:\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n\"WASHINGTON, D.C., October 16 1864\r\n\r\n\"To MAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN,\r\n\"Rectortown, Va.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant says that Longstreet brought with him no troops from\r\nRichmond, but I have very little confidence in the information\r\ncollected at his headquarters.  If you can leave your command with\r\nsafety, come to Washington, as I wish to give you the views of the\r\nauthorities here.\r\n\r\n\"H. W. HALLECK, Major-General, Chief-of-Staff.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the Longstreet despatch, I felt a concern about my\r\nabsence which I could hardly repress, but after duly considering what\r\nHalleck said, and believing that Longstreet could not unite with\r\nEarly before I got back, and that even if he did Wright would be able\r\nto cope with them both, I and my staff, with our horses, took the\r\ncars for Washington, where we arrived on the morning of the 17th at\r\nabout 8 o'clock.  I proceeded at an early hour to the War Department,\r\nand as soon as I met Secretary Stanton, asked him for a special train\r\nto be ready at 12 o'clock to take me to Martinsburg, saying that in\r\nview of existing conditions I must get back to my army as quickly as\r\npossible.  He at once gave the order for the train, and then the\r\nSecretary, Halleck, and I proceeded to hold a consultation in regard\r\nto my operating east of the Blue Ridge.  The upshot was that my views\r\nagainst such a plan were practically agreed to, and two engineer\r\nofficers were designated to return with me for the purpose of\r\nreporting on a defensive line in the valley that could be held while\r\nthe bulk of my troops were being detached to Petersburg.  Colonel\r\nAlexander and Colonel Thom both of the Engineer Corps, reported to\r\naccompany me, and at 12 o'clock we took the train.\r\n\r\nWe arrived about dark at Martinsburg, and there found the escort of\r\nthree hundred men which I had ordered before leaving Cedar Creek.  We\r\nspent that night at Martinsburg, and early next morning mounted and\r\nstarted up the Valley pike for Winchester, leaving Captain Sheridan\r\nbehind to conduct to the army the Commissioners whom the State of New\r\nYork had sent down to receive the vote of her troops in the coming\r\nPresidential election.  Colonel Alexander was a man of enormous\r\nweight, and Colonel Thom correspondingly light, and as both were\r\nunaccustomed to riding we had to go slowly, losing so much time, in\r\nfact, that we did not reach Winchester till between 3 and 4 o'clock\r\nin the afternoon, though the distance is but twenty-eight miles.  As\r\nsoon as we arrived at Colonel Edwards's headquarters in the town,\r\nwhere I intended stopping for the night, I sent a courier to the\r\nfront to bring me a report of the condition of affairs, and then took\r\nColonel Alexander out on the heights about Winchester, in order that\r\nhe might overlook the country, and make up his mind as to the utility\r\nof fortifying there.  By the time we had completed our survey it was\r\ndark, and just as we reached Colonel Edwards's house on our return a\r\ncourier came in from Cedar Creek bringing word that everything was\r\nall right, that the enemy was quiet at Fisher's Hill, and that a\r\nbrigade of Grover's division was to make a reconnoissance in the\r\nmorning, the 19th, so about 10 o'clock I went to bed greatly\r\nrelieved, and expecting to rejoin my headquarters at my leisure next\r\nday.\r\n\r\nToward 6 o'clock the morning of the 19th, the officer on picket duty\r\nat Winchester came to my room, I being yet in bed, and reported\r\nartillery firing from the direction of Cedar Creek.  I asked him if\r\nthe firing was continuous or only desultory, to which he replied that\r\nit was not a sustained fire, but rather irregular and fitful.  I\r\nremarked: \"It's all right; Grover has gone out this morning to make a\r\nreconnoissance, and he is merely feeling the enemy.\" I tried to go to\r\nsleep again, but grew so restless that I could not, and soon got up\r\nand dressed myself.  A little later the picket officer came back and\r\nreported that the firing, which could be distinctly heard from his\r\nline on the heights outside of Winchester, was still going on.  I\r\nasked him if it sounded like a battle, and as he again said that it\r\ndid not, I still inferred that the cannonading was caused by Grover's\r\ndivision banging away at the enemy simply to find out what he was up\r\nto.  However, I went down-stairs and requested that breakfast be\r\nhurried up, and at the same time ordered the horses to be saddled and\r\nin readiness, for I concluded to go to the front before any further\r\nexaminations were made in regard to the defensive line.\r\n\r\nWe mounted our horses between half-past 8 and 9, and as we were\r\nproceeding up the street which leads directly through Winchester,\r\nfrom the Logan residence, where Edwards was quartered, to the Valley\r\npike, I noticed that there were many women at the windows and doors\r\nof the houses, who kept shaking their skirts at us and who were\r\notherwise markedly insolent in their demeanor, but supposing this\r\nconduct to be instigated by their well-known and perhaps natural\r\nprejudices, I ascribed to it no unusual significance.  On reaching\r\nthe edge of the town I halted a moment, and there heard quite\r\ndistinctly the sound of artillery firing in an unceasing roar.\r\nConcluding from this that a battle was in progress, I now felt\r\nconfident that the women along the street had received intelligence\r\nfrom the battle, field by the \"grape-vine telegraph,\" and were in\r\nraptures over some good news, while I as yet was utterly ignorant of\r\nthe actual situation.  Moving on, I put my head down toward the\r\npommel of my saddle and listened intently, trying to locate and\r\ninterpret the sound, continuing in this position till we had crossed\r\nMill Creek, about half a mile from Winchester.  The result of my\r\nefforts in the interval was the conviction that the travel of the\r\nsound was increasing too rapidly to be accounted for by my own rate\r\nof motion, and that therefore my army must be falling back.\r\n\r\nAt Mill Creek my escort fell in behind, and we were going ahead at a\r\nregular pace, when, just as we made the crest of the rise beyond the\r\nstream, there burst upon our view the appalling spectacle of a\r\npanic-stricken army-hundreds of slightly wounded men, throngs of others\r\nunhurt but utterly demoralized, and baggage-wagons by the score, all\r\npressing to the rear in hopeless confusion, telling only too plainly\r\nthat a disaster had occurred at the front.  On accosting some of the\r\nfugitives, they assured me that the army was broken up, in full\r\nretreat, and that all was lost; all this with a manner true to that\r\npeculiar indifference that takes possession of panic-stricken men.  I\r\nwas greatly disturbed by the sight, but at once sent word to Colonel\r\nEdwards commanding the brigade in Winchester, to stretch his troops\r\nacross the valley, near Mill Creek, and stop all fugitives, directing\r\nalso that the transportation be, passed through and parked on the north\r\nside of the town.\r\n\r\nAs I continued at a walk a few hundred yards farther, thinking all\r\nthe time of Longstreet's telegram to Early, \"Be ready when I join\r\nyou, and we will crush Sheridan,\" I was fixing in my mind what I\r\nshould do.  My first thought was too stop the army in the suburbs of\r\nWinchester as it came back, form a new line, and fight there; but as\r\nthe situation was more maturely considered a better conception\r\nprevailed.  I was sure the troops had confidence in me, for\r\nheretofore we had been successful; and as at other times they had\r\nseen me present at the slightest sign of trouble or distress, I felt\r\nthat I ought to try now to restore their broken ranks, or, failing in\r\nthat, to share their fate because of what they had done hitherto.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Colonel Wood, my chief commissary, arrived from the\r\nfront and gave me fuller intelligence, reporting that everything was\r\ngone, my headquarters captured, and the troops dispersed.  When I\r\nheard this I took two of my aides-de-camp, Major. George A. Forsyth\r\nand Captain Joseph O'Keefe, and with twenty men from the escort\r\nstarted for the front, at the same time directing Colonel James W.\r\nForsyth and Colonels Alexander and Thom to remain behind and do what\r\nthey could to stop the runaways.\r\n\r\nFor a short distance I traveled on the road, but soon found it so\r\nblocked with wagons and wounded men that my progress was impeded, and\r\nI was forced to take to the adjoining fields to make haste.  When\r\nmost of the wagons and wounded were past I returned to the road,\r\nwhich was thickly lined with unhurt  men, who, having got far enough\r\nto the rear to be out of danger, had halted, without any\r\norganization, and begun cooking coffee, but when they saw me they\r\nabandoned their coffee, threw up their hats, shouldered their\r\nmuskets, and as I passed along turned to follow with enthusiasm and\r\ncheers.  To acknowledge this exhibition of feeling I took off my hat,\r\nand with Forsyth and O'Keefe rode some distance in advance of my\r\nescort, while every mounted officer who saw me galloped out on either\r\nside of the pike to tell the men at a distance that I had come back.\r\nIn this way the news was spread to the stragglers off the road, when\r\nthey, too, turned their faces to the front and marched toward the\r\nenemy, changing in a moment from the depths of depression, to the\r\nextreme of enthusiasm.  I already knew that even in the ordinary\r\ncondition of mind enthusiasm is a potent element with soldiers, but\r\nwhat I saw that day convinced me that if it can be excited from a\r\nstate of despondency its power is almost irresistible.  I said\r\nnothing except to remark as I rode among those on the road: \"If I had\r\nbeen, with you this morning this disaster would not have happened.\r\nWe must face the other way; we will go back and recover our camp.\"\r\n\r\nMy first halt was made just north of Newtown, where I met a chaplain\r\ndigging his heels into the sides of his jaded horse, and making for\r\nthe rear with all possible speed.  I drew up for an instant, and\r\ninquired of him how matters were going at the front.  He replied,\r\n\"Everything is lost; but all will be right when you get there\"; yet\r\nnotwithstanding this expression of confidence in me, the parson at\r\nonce resumed his breathless pace to the rear.  At Newtown I was\r\nobliged to make a circuit to the left, to get round the village.  I\r\ncould not pass through it, the streets were so crowded, but meeting\r\non this detour Major McKinley, of Crook's staff, he spread the news\r\nof my return through the motley throng there.\r\n\r\nWhen nearing the Valley pike, just south of Newtown I saw about\r\nthree-fourths of a mile west of the pike a body of troops, which\r\nproved to be Ricketts's and Wheaton's divisions of the Sixth Corps,\r\nand then learned that the Nineteenth Corps had halted a little to the\r\nright and rear of these; but I did not stop, desiring to get to the\r\nextreme front.  Continuing on parallel with the pike, about midway\r\nbetween Newtown and Middletown I crossed to the west of it, and a\r\nlittle later came up in rear of Getty's division of the Sixth Corps.\r\nWhen I arrived, this division and the cavalry were the only troops in\r\nthe presence of and resisting the enemy; they were apparently acting\r\nas a rear-guard at a point about three miles north of the line we\r\nheld at Cedar Creek when the battle began.  General Torbert was the\r\nfirst officer to meet me, saying as he rode up, \"My God! I am glad\r\nyou've come.\" Getty's division, when I found it, was about a mile\r\nnorth of Middletown, posted on the reverse slope of some slightly\r\nrising ground, holding a barricade made with fence-rails, and\r\nskirmishing slightly with the enemy's pickets.  Jumping my horse over\r\nthe line of rails, I rode to the crest of the elevation, and there\r\ntaking off my hat, the men rose up from behind their barricade with\r\ncheers of recognition.  An officer of the Vermont brigade, Colonel A.\r\nS. Tracy, rode out to the front, and joining me, informed me that\r\nGeneral Louis A. Grant was in command there, the regular division\r\ncommander, General Getty, having taken charge of the Sixth Corps in\r\nplace of  Ricketts, wounded early in the action, while temporarily\r\ncommanding the corps.  I then turned back to the rear of Getty's\r\ndivision, and as I came behind it, a line of regimental flags rose up\r\nout of the ground, as it seemed, to welcome me.  They were mostly the\r\ncolors of Crook's troops, who had been stampeded and scattered in the\r\nsurprise of the morning.  The color-bearers, having withstood the\r\npanic, had formed behind the troops of Getty.  The line with the\r\ncolors was largely composed of officers, among whom I recognized\r\nColonel R. B. Hayes, since president of the United States, one of the\r\nbrigade commanders.  At the close of this incident I crossed the\r\nlittle narrow valley, or depression, in rear of Getty's line, and\r\ndismounting on the opposite crest, established that point as my\r\nheadquarters.  In a few minutes some of my staff joined me, and the\r\nfirst directions I gave were to have the Nineteenth Corps and the two\r\ndivisions of Wright's corps brought to the front, so they could be\r\nformed on Getty's division, prolonged to the right; for I had already\r\ndecided to attack the enemy from that line as soon as I could get\r\nmatters in shape to take the offensive.  Crook met me at this time,\r\nand strongly favored my idea of attacking, but said, however, that\r\nmost of his troops were gone.  General Wright came up a little later,\r\nwhen I saw that he was wounded, a ball having grazed the point of his\r\nchin so as to draw the blood plentifully.\r\n\r\nWright gave me a hurried account of the day's events, and when told\r\nthat we would fight the enemy on the line which Getty and the cavalry\r\nwere holding, and that he must go himself and send all his staff to\r\nbring up the troops, he zealously fell in with the scheme; and it was\r\nthen that the Nineteenth Corps and two divisions of the Sixth were\r\nordered to the front from where they had been halted to the right and\r\nrear of Getty.\r\n\r\nAfter this conversation I rode to the east of the Valley pike and to\r\nthe left of Getty's division, to a point from which I could obtain a\r\ngood view of the front, in the mean time sending Major Forsyth to\r\ncommunicate with Colonel Lowell (who occupied a position close in\r\ntoward the suburbs of Middletown and directly in front of Getty's\r\nleft) to learn whether he could hold on there.  Lowell replied that\r\nhe could.  I then ordered Custer's division back to the right flank,\r\nand returning to the place where my headquarters had been established\r\nI met near them Ricketts's division under General Keifer and General\r\nFrank Wheaton's division, both marching to the front.  When the men\r\nof these divisions saw me they began cheering and took up the double\r\nquick to the front, while I turned back toward Getty's line to point\r\nout where these returning troops should be placed.  Having done this,\r\nI ordered General Wright to resume command of the Sixth Corps, and\r\nGetty, who was temporarily in charge of it, to take command of his\r\nown division.  A little later the Nineteenth Corps came up and was\r\nposted between the right of the Sixth Corps and Middle Marsh Brook.\r\n\r\nAll this had consumed a great deal of time, and I concluded to visit\r\nagain the point to the east of the Valley pike, from where I had\r\nfirst observed the enemy, to see what he was doing.  Arrived there, I\r\ncould plainly see him getting ready for attack, and Major Forsyth now\r\nsuggested that it would be well to ride along the line of battle\r\nbefore the enemy assailed us, for although the troops had learned of\r\nmy return, but few of them had seen me.  Following his suggestion I\r\nstarted in behind the men, but when a few paces had been taken I\r\ncrossed to the front and, hat in hand, passed along the entire length\r\nof the infantry line; and it is from this circumstance that many of\r\nthe officers and men who then received me with such heartiness have\r\nsince supposed that that was my first appearance on the field.  But\r\nat least two hours had elapsed since I reached the ground, for it was\r\nafter mid-day, when this incident of riding down the front took\r\nplace, and I arrived not later, certainly, than half-past 10 o'clock.\r\n\r\nAfter re-arranging the line and preparing to attack I returned again\r\nto observe the Confederates, who shortly began to advance on us.  The\r\nattacking columns did not cover my entire front, and it appeared that\r\ntheir onset would be mainly directed against the Nineteenth Corps,\r\nso, fearing that they might be too strong for Emory on account of his\r\ndepleted condition (many of his men not having had time to get up\r\nfrom the rear), and Getty's division being free from assault I\r\ntransferred a part of it from the extreme left to the support of the\r\nNineteenth Corps.  The assault was quickly repulsed by Emory,\r\nhowever, and as the enemy fell back Getty's troops were returned to\r\ntheir original place.  This repulse of the Confederates made me feel\r\npretty safe from further offensive operations on their part, and I\r\nnow decided to suspend the fighting till my thin ranks were further\r\nstrengthened by the men who were continually coming up from the rear,\r\nand particularly till Crook's troops could be assembled on the\r\nextreme left.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the despatch already mentioned, \"Be ready when I\r\njoin you, and we will crush Sheridan,\" since learned to have been\r\nfictitious, I had been supposing all day that Longstreet's troops\r\nwere present, but as no definite intelligence on this point had been\r\ngathered, I concluded, in the lull that now occurred, to ascertain\r\nsomething positive regarding Longstreet; and Merritt having been\r\ntransferred to our left in the morning, I directed him to attack an\r\nexposed battery then at the edge of Middletown, and capture some\r\nprisoners.  Merritt soon did this work effectually, concealing his\r\nintention till his troops got close in to the enemy, and then by a\r\nquick dash gobbling up a number of Confederates.  When the prisoners\r\nwere brought in, I learned from them that the only troops of\r\nLongstreet's in the fight were of Kershaw's division, which had\r\nrejoined Early at Brown's Gap in the latter part of September, and\r\nthat the rest of Longstreet's corps was not on the field.  The\r\nreceipt of this information entirely cleared the way for me to take\r\nthe offensive, but on the heels of it came information that\r\nLongstreet was marching by the Front Royal pike to strike my rear at\r\nWinchester, driving Powell's cavalry in as he advanced.  This renewed\r\nmy uneasiness, and caused me to delay the general attack till after\r\nassurances came from Powell denying utterly the reports as to\r\nLongstreet, and confirming the statements of the prisoners.\r\n\r\nBetween half-past and 4 o'clock, I was ready to assail, and decided\r\nto do so by advancing my infantry line in a swinging movement, so as\r\nto gain the Valley pike with my right between Middletown and the\r\nBelle Grove House; and when the order was passed along, the men\r\npushed steadily forward with enthusiasm and confidence.  General\r\nEarly's troops extended some little distance beyond our right, and\r\nwhen my flank neared the overlapping enemy, he turned on it, with the\r\neffect of causing a momentary confusion, but General McMillan quickly\r\nrealizing the danger, broke the Confederates at the reentering angle\r\nby a counter charge with his brigade, doing his work so well that the\r\nenemy's flanking troops were cut off from their main body and left to\r\nshift for themselves.  Custer, who was just then moving in from the\r\nwest side of Middle Marsh Brook, followed McMillan's timely blow with\r\na charge of cavalry, but before starting out on it, and while his men\r\nwere forming, riding at full speed himself, to throw his arms around\r\nmy neck.  By the time he had disengaged himself from this embrace,\r\nthe troops broken by McMillan had gained some little distance to\r\ntheir rear, but Custer's troopers sweeping across the Middletown\r\nmeadows and down toward Cedar Creek, took many of them prisoners\r\nbefore they could reach the stream--so I forgave his delay.\r\n\r\nMy whole line as far as the eye could see was now driving everything\r\nbefore it, from behind trees, stone walls, and all such sheltering\r\nobstacles, so I rode toward the left to ascertain how matters were\r\ngetting on there.  As I passed along behind the advancing troops,\r\nfirst General Grover, and then Colonel Mackenzie, rode up to welcome\r\nme.  Both were severely wounded, and I told them to leave the field,\r\nbut they implored permission to remain till success was certain.\r\nWhen I reached the Valley pike Crook had reorganized his men, and as\r\nI desired that they should take part in the fight, for they were the\r\nvery same troops that had turned Early's flank at Winchester and at\r\nFisher's Hill, I ordered them to be pushed forward; and the alacrity\r\nand celerity with which they moved on Middletown demonstrated that\r\ntheir ill-fortune of the morning had not sprung from lack of valor.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Lowell's brigade of cavalry, which, it will be remembered,\r\nhad been holding on, dismounted, just north of Middletown ever since\r\nthe time I arrived from Winchester, fell to the rear for the purpose\r\nof getting their led horses.  A momentary panic was created in the\r\nnearest brigade of infantry by this withdrawal of Lowell, but as soon\r\nas his men were mounted they charged the enemy clear up to the stone\r\nwalls in the edge of Middletown; at sight of this the infantry\r\nbrigade renewed its attack, and the enemy's right gave way.  The\r\naccomplished Lowell received his death-wound in this courageous\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nAll our troops were now moving on the retreating Confederates, and as\r\nI rode to the front Colonel Gibbs, who succeeded Lowell, made ready\r\nfor another mounted charge, but I checked him from pressing the\r\nenemy's right, in the hope that the swinging attack from my right\r\nwould throw most of the Confederates to the east of the Valley pike,\r\nand hence off their line of retreat through Strasburg to Fisher's\r\nHill.  The eagerness of the men soon frustrated this anticipation,\r\nhowever, the left insisting on keeping pace with the centre and\r\nright, and all pushing ahead till we regained our old camps at Cedar\r\nCreek.  Beyond Cedar Creek, at Strasburg, the pike makes a sharp turn\r\nto the west toward Fisher's Hill, and here Merritt uniting with\r\nCuster, they together fell on the flank of the retreating columns,\r\ntaking many prisoners, wagons, and guns, among the prisoners being\r\nMajor-General Ramseur, who, mortally wounded, died the next day.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of the victory was received, General Grant directed a\r\nsalute of one hundred shotted guns to be fired into Petersburg, and\r\nthe President at once thanked the army in an autograph letter.  A few\r\nweeks after, he promoted me, and I received notice of this in a\r\nspecial letter from the Secretary of War, saying:\r\n\r\n\"--that for the personal gallantry, military skill, and just confidence\r\nin the courage and patriotism of your troops, displayed by you on the\r\n19th day of October at Cedar Run, whereby, under the blessing of\r\nProvidence, your routed army was reorganized, a great National\r\ndisaster averted, and a brilliant victory achieved over the rebels\r\nfor the third time in pitched battle within thirty days, Philip H.\r\nSheridan is appointed a major-general in the United States Army.\"\r\n\r\nThe direct result of the battle was the recapture of all the\r\nartillery, transportation, and camp equipage we had lost, and in\r\naddition twenty-four pieces of the enemy's artillery, twelve hundred\r\nprisoners, and a number of battle-flags.  But more still flowed from\r\nthis victory, succeeding as it did the disaster of the morning, for\r\nthe reoccupation of our old camps at once re-established a morale\r\nwhich for some hours had been greatly endangered by ill-fortune.\r\n\r\nIt was not till after the battle that I learned fully what had taken\r\nplace before my arrival, and then found that the enemy, having\r\ngathered all the strength he could through the return of\r\nconvalescents and other absentees, had moved quietly from Fisher's\r\nHill, in the night of the 18th and early on the morning of the 19th,\r\nto surprise my army, which, it should be remembered, was posted on\r\nthe north bank of Cedar Creek, Crook holding on the left of the\r\nValley pike, with Thoburn's division advanced toward the creek on\r\nDuval's (under Colonel Rutherford B. Hayes) and Kitching's\r\nprovisional divisions to the north and rear of Thoburn.  The\r\nNineteenth Corps was on the right of Crook, extending in a\r\nsemi-circular line from the pike nearly to Meadow Brook, while the\r\nSixth Corps lay to the west of the brook in readiness to be used as a\r\nmovable column.  Merritt's division was to the right and rear of the\r\nSixth Corps, and about a mile and a half west of Merrit was Custer\r\ncovering the fords of Cedar Creek as far west as the Middle road.\r\n\r\nGeneral Early's plan was for one column under General Gordon,\r\nconsisting of three divisions of infantry (Gordon's, Ramseur's, and\r\nPegram's), and Payne's brigade of cavalry to cross the Shenandoah\r\nRiver directly east of the Confederate works at Fisher's Hill, march\r\naround the northerly face of the Massanutten Mountain, and again\r\ncross the Shenandoah at Bowman's and McInturff's fords.  Payne's task\r\nwas to capture me at the Belle Grove House.  General Early himself,\r\nwith Kershaw's and Wharton's divisions, was to move through\r\nStrasburg, Kershaw, accompanied by Early, to cross Cedar Creek at\r\nRoberts's ford and connect with Gordon, while Wharton was to continue\r\non the Valley pike to Hupp's Hill and join the left of Kershaw, when\r\nthe crossing of the Valley pike over Cedar Creek became free.\r\n\r\nLomax's cavalry, then in the Luray Valley, was ordered to join the\r\nright of Gordon on the field of battle, while Rosser was to carry the\r\ncrossing of Cedar Creek on the Back road and attack Custer.  Early's\r\nconceptions were carried through in the darkness with little accident\r\nor delay, Kershaw opening the fight by a furious attack on Thoburn's\r\ndivision, while at dawn and in a dense fog Gordon struck Crook's\r\nextreme left, surprising his pickets, and bursting into his camp with\r\nsuch suddenness as to stampede Crook's men.  Gordon directing his\r\nmarch on my headquarters (the Belle Grove House), successfully turned\r\nour position as he gained the Valley pike, and General Wright was\r\nthus forced to order the withdrawal of the Nineteenth Corps from its\r\npost at the Cedar Creek crossing, and this enabled Wharton to get\r\nover the stream there unmolested and join Kershaw early in the\r\naction.\r\n\r\nAfter Crook's troops had been driven from their camps, General Wright\r\nendeavored to form a line with the Sixth Corps to hold the Valley\r\npike to the left of the Nineteenth, but failing in this he ordered\r\nthe withdrawal of the latter corps, Ricketts, temporarily commanding\r\nthe Sixth Corps, checking Gordon till Emory had retired.  As already\r\nstated, Wharton was thus permitted to cross Cedar Creek on the pike,\r\nand now that Early had a continuous line, he pressed his advantage so\r\nvigorously that the whole Union army was soon driven from its camps\r\nin more or less disorder; and though much disjointed resistance was\r\ndisplayed, it may be said that no systematic stand was made until\r\nGetty's division, aided by Torbert's cavalry, which Wright had\r\nordered to the left early in the action, took up the ground where, on\r\narriving from Winchester, I found them.\r\n\r\nWhen I left my command on the 16th, little did I anticipate that\r\nanything like this would happen.  Indeed, I felt satisfied that Early\r\nwas, of himself, too weak to take the offensive, and although I\r\ndoubted the Longstreet despatch, yet I was confident that, even\r\nshould it prove true, I could get back before the junction could be\r\nmade, and at the worst I felt certain that my army was equal to\r\nconfronting the forces of Longstreet and Early combined.  Still, the\r\nsurprise of the morning might have befallen me as well as the general\r\non whom it did descend, and though it is possible that this could\r\nhave been precluded had Powell's cavalry been closed in, as suggested\r\nin my despatch from Front Royal, yet the enemy's desperation might\r\nhave prompted some other clever and ingenious scheme for relieving\r\nhis fallen fortunes in the Shenandoah Valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nGENERAL EARLY REORGANIZES HIS FORCES--MOSBY THE GUERRILLA--GENERAL\r\nMERRITT SENT TO OPERATE AGAINST MOSBY--ROSSER AGAIN ACTIVE--GENERAL\r\nCUSTER SURPRISED--COLONEL YOUNG SENT TO CAPTURE GILMORE THE\r\nGUERRILLA--COLONEL YOUNG'S SUCCESS--CAPTURE OF GENERAL KELLY AND\r\nGENERAL CROOK--SPIES--WAS WILKES BOOTH A SPY?--DRIVING THE\r\nCONFEDERATES OUT OF THE VALLEY--THE BATTLE OF WAYNESBORO'--MARCHING\r\nTO JOIN THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.\r\n\r\nEarly's broken army practically made no halt in its retreat after the\r\nbattle of Cedar-Creek until it reached New Market, though at Fisher's\r\nHill was left a small rear-guard of cavalry, which hastily decamped,\r\nhowever, when charged by Gibbs's brigade on the morning of the 20th.\r\nBetween the date of his signal defeat and the 11th of November, the\r\nenemy's scattered forces had sufficiently reorganized to permit his\r\nagain making a reconnoissance in the valley as far north as Cedar\r\nCreek, my army having meanwhile withdrawn to Kernstown, where it had\r\nbeen finally decided that a defensive line should be held to enable\r\nme to detach troops to General Grant, and where, by reconstructing\r\nthe Winchester and Potomac railroad from Stephenson's depot to\r\nHarper's Ferry, my command might be more readily, supplied.  Early's\r\nreconnoissance north of Cedar Creek ended in a rapid withdrawal of\r\nhis infantry after feeling my front, and with the usual ill-fortune\r\nto his cavalry; Merritt and Custer driving Rosser and Lomax with ease\r\nacross Cedar Creek on the Middle and Back roads, while Powell's\r\ncavalry struck McCausland near Stony Point, and after capturing two\r\npieces of artillery and about three hundred officers and men chased\r\nhim into the Luray Valley.\r\n\r\nEarly got back to New Market on the 14th of November, and, from lack\r\nof subsistence, being unable to continue demonstrations to prevent my\r\nreinforcement of General Grant, began himself to detach to General\r\nLee by returning Kershaw's division to Petersburg, as was definitely\r\nascertained by Torbert in a reconnoissance to Mount Jackson.  At this\r\ntime General Grant wished me to send him the Sixth Corps, and it was\r\ngot ready for the purpose, but when I informed him that Torbert's\r\nreconnoissance had developed the fact that Early still retained four\r\ndivisions of infantry and one of cavalry, it was decided, on my\r\nsuggestion, to let the Sixth Corps remain till the season should be a\r\nlittle further advanced, when the inclemency of the weather would\r\npreclude infantry campaigning.  These conditions came about early in\r\nDecember, and by the middle of the month the whole of the Sixth Corps\r\nwas at Petersburg; simultaneously with its transfer to that line\r\nEarly sending his Second Corps to Lee.\r\n\r\nDuring the entire campaign I had been annoyed by guerrilla bands\r\nunder such partisan chiefs as Mosby, White, Gilmore, McNeil, and\r\nothers, and this had considerably depleted my line-of-battle\r\nstrength, necessitating as it did large, escorts for my\r\nsupply-trains.  The most redoubtable of these leaders was Mosby, whose\r\nforce was made up from the country around Upperville, east of the Blue\r\nRidge, to which section he always fled for a hiding-place when he\r\nscented danger.  I had not directed any special operations against\r\nthese partisans while the campaign was active, but as Mosby's men had\r\nlately killed, within my lines, my chief quartermaster, Colonel Tolles,\r\nand Medical Inspector Ohlenchlager, I concluded to devote particular\r\nattention to these \"irregulars\" during the lull that now occurred; so\r\non the 28th of November, I directed General Merritt to march to the\r\nLoudoun Valley and operate against Mosby, taking care to clear the\r\ncountry of forage and subsistence, so as to prevent the guerrillas from\r\nbeing harbored there in the future their destruction or capture being\r\nwell-nigh impossible, on account of their intimate knowledge of the\r\nmountain region.  Merritt carried out his instructions with his usual\r\nsagacity and thoroughness, sweeping widely over each side of his\r\ngeneral line of march with flankers, who burned the grain and brought\r\nin large herds of cattle, hogs and sheep, which were issued to the\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nWhile Merritt was engaged in this service the Baltimore and Ohio\r\nrailroad once more received the attention of the enemy; Rosser, with\r\ntwo brigades of cavalry, crossing the Great North Mountain, capturing\r\nthe post of New Creek, with about five hundred prisoners and seven\r\nguns, destroying all the supplies of the garrison, and breaking up\r\nthe railroad track.  This slight success of the Confederates in West\r\nVirginia, and the intelligence that they were contemplating further\r\nraids in that section, led me to send, Crook there with one division,\r\nhis other troops going to City Point; and, I hoped that all the\r\nthreatened places would thus be sufficiently protected, but\r\nnegligence at Beverly resulted in the capture of that station by\r\nRosser on the 11th of January.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, Early established himself with Wharton's division\r\nat Staunton in winter quarters, posting his cavalry in that\r\nneighborhood also, except a detachment at New Market, and another\r\nsmall one at the signal-station on Three Top Mountain.  The winter was\r\na most severe one, snow falling frequently to the depth of several\r\ninches, and the mercury often sinking below zero.  The rigor of the\r\nseason was very much against the success of any mounted operations,\r\nbut General Grant being very desirous to have the railroads broken up\r\nabout Gordonsville and Charlottesville, on the 19th of December I\r\nstarted the cavalry out for that purpose, Torbert, with Merritt and\r\nPowell, marching through Chester Gap, while Custer moved toward\r\nStaunton to make a demonstration in Torbert's favor, hoping to hold\r\nthe enemy's troops in the valley.  Unfortunately, Custer did not\r\naccomplish all that was expected of him, and being surprised by\r\nRosser and Payne near Lacy's Springs before reveille, had to abandon\r\nhis bivouac and retreat down the valley, with the loss of a number of\r\nprisoners, a few horses, and a good many horse equipments, for,\r\nbecause of the suddenness of Rosser's attack, many of the men had no\r\ntime to saddle up.  As soon as Custer's retreat was assured,\r\nWharton's division of infantry was sent to Charlottesville to check\r\nTorbert, but this had already been done by Lomax, with the assistance\r\nof infantry sent up from Richmond.  Indeed, from the very beginning\r\nof the movement the Confederates had been closely observing the\r\ncolumns of Torbert and Custer, and in consequence of the knowledge\r\nthus derived, Early had marched Lomax to Gordonsville in anticipation\r\nof an attack there, at the same time sending Rosser down the valley\r\nto meet Custer.  Torbert in the performance of his task captured two\r\npieces of artillery from Johnson's and McCausland's brigades, at\r\nLiberty Mills on the Rapidan River, but in the main the purpose of\r\nthe raid utterly failed, so by the 27th of December he returned,\r\nmany, of his men badly frost-bitten from the extreme cold which had\r\nprevailed.\r\n\r\nThis expedition practically closed all operations for the season, and\r\nthe cavalry was put into winter cantonment near Winchester.  The\r\ndistribution of my infantry to Petersburg and West Virginia left with\r\nme in the beginning of the new year, as already stated, but the one\r\nsmall division of the Nineteenth Corps.  On account of this\r\ndiminution of force, it became necessary for me to keep thoroughly\r\nposted in regard to the enemy, and I now realized more than I had\r\ndone hitherto how efficient my scouts had become since under the\r\ncontrol of Colonel Young; for not only did they bring me almost every\r\nday intelligence from within Early's lines, but they also operated\r\nefficiently against the guerrillas infesting West Virginia.\r\n\r\nHarry Gilmore, of Maryland, was the most noted of these since the\r\ndeath of McNeil, and as the scouts had reported him in Harrisonburg\r\nthe latter part of January, I directed two of the most trustworthy to\r\nbe sent to watch his movements and ascertain his purposes.  In a few\r\ndays these spies returned with the intelligence that Gilmore was on\r\nhis way to Moorefield, the centre of a very disloyal section in West\r\nVirginia, about ninety miles southwest of Winchester, where, under\r\nthe guise of a camp-meeting, a gathering was to take place, at which\r\nhe expected to enlist a number of men, be joined by a party of about\r\ntwenty recruits coming from Maryland, and then begin depredations\r\nalong the Baltimore and Ohio railroad.  Believing that Gilmore might\r\nbe captured, I directed Young to undertake the task, and as a\r\npreliminary step he sent to Moorefield two of his men who early in\r\nthe war had \"refugeed\" from that section and enlisted in one of the\r\nUnion regiments from West Virginia.  In about a week these men came\r\nback and reported that Gilmore was living at a house between three\r\nand four miles from Moorefield, and gave full particulars as to his\r\ncoming and going, the number of men he had about there and where they\r\nrendezvoused.\r\n\r\nWith this knowledge at hand I directed Young to take twenty of his\r\nbest men and leave that night for Moorefield, dressed in Confederate\r\nuniforms, telling him that I would have about three hundred cavalry\r\nfollow in his wake when he had got about fifteen miles start, and\r\ninstructing him to pass his party off as a body of recruits for\r\nGilmore coming from Maryland and pursued by the Yankee cavalry.  I\r\nknew this would allay suspicion and provide him help on the road;\r\nand, indeed, as Colonel Whittaker, who alone knew the secret,\r\nfollowed after the fleeing \"Marylanders,\" he found that their advent\r\nhad caused so little remark that the trail would have been lost had\r\nhe not already known their destination.  Young met with a hearty,\r\nwelcome wherever he halted on the way, and as he passed through the\r\ntown of Moorefield learned with satisfaction that Gilmore still made\r\nhis headquarters at the house where the report of the two scouts had\r\nlocated him a few days before.  Reaching the designated place about\r\n12 o'clock on the night of the 5th of February, Young, under the\r\nrepresentation that he had come directly from Maryland and was being\r\npursued by the Union cavalry, gained immediate access to Gilmore's\r\nroom.  He found the bold guerrilla snugly tucked in bed, with two\r\npistols lying on a chair near by.  He was sleeping so soundly that to\r\narouse him Young had to give him a violent shake.  As he awoke and\r\nasked who was disturbing his slumbers, Young, pointing at him a\r\ncocked six-shooter, ordered him to dress without delay, and in answer\r\nto his inquiry, informed him that he was a prisoner to one of\r\nSheridan's staff.  Meanwhile Gilmore's men had learned of his\r\ntrouble, but the early appearance of Colonel Whittaker caused them to\r\ndisperse; thus the last link between Maryland and the Confederacy was\r\ncarried a prisoner to Winchester, whence he was sent to Fort Warren.\r\n\r\nThe capture of Gilmore caused the disbandment of the party he had\r\norganized at the \"camp-meeting,\" most of the men he had recruited\r\nreturning to their homes discouraged, though some few joined the\r\nbands of Woodson and young Jesse McNeil, which, led by the latter,\r\ndashed into Cumberland, Maryland, at 3 O'clock on the morning of the\r\n21st of February and made a reprisal by carrying off General Crook\r\nand General Kelly, and doing their work so silently and quickly that\r\nthey escaped without being noticed, and were some distance on their\r\nway before the colored watchman at the hotel where Crook was\r\nquartered could compose himself enough to give the alarm.  A troop of\r\ncavalry gave hot chase from Cumberland, striving to intercept the\r\nparty at Moorefield and other points, but all efforts were fruitless,\r\nthe prisoners soon being beyond reach.\r\n\r\nAlthough I had adopted the general rule of employing only soldiers as\r\nscouts, there was an occasional exception to it.  I cannot say that\r\nthese exceptions proved wholly that an ironclad observance of the\r\nrule would have been best, but I am sure of it in one instance.  A\r\nman named Lomas, who claimed to be a Marylander, offered me his\r\nservices as a spy, and coming highly recommended from Mr. Stanton,\r\nwho had made use of him in that capacity, I employed him.  He made\r\nmany pretensions, often appearing over anxious to impart information\r\nseemingly intended to impress me with his importance, and yet was\r\nmore than ordinarily intelligent, but in spite of that my confidence\r\nin him was by no means unlimited.  I often found what he reported to\r\nme as taking place within the Confederate lines corroborated by\r\nYoung's men, but generally there were discrepancies in his tales,\r\nwhich led me to suspect that he was employed by the enemy as well as\r\nby me.  I felt, however, that with good watching he could do me\r\nlittle harm, and if my suspicions were incorrect he might be very\r\nuseful, so I held on to him.\r\n\r\nEarly in February Lomas was very solicitous for me to employ a man\r\nwho, he said, had been with Mosby, but on account of some quarrel in\r\nthe irregular camp had abandoned that leader.  Thinking that with two\r\nof them I might destroy the railroad bridges east of Lynchburg, I\r\nconcluded, after the Mosby man had been brought to my headquarters by\r\nLomas about 12 o'clock one night, to give him employment, at the same\r\ntime informing Colonel Young that I suspected their fidelity,\r\nhowever, and that he must test it by shadowing their every movement.\r\nWhen Lomas's companion entered my room he was completely disguised,\r\nbut on discarding the various contrivances by which his identity was\r\nconcealed he proved to be a rather slender, dark-complexioned,\r\nhandsome young man, of easy address and captivating manners.  He gave\r\nhis name as Renfrew, answered all my questions satisfactorily, and\r\nwent into details about Mosby and his men which showed an intimacy\r\nwith them at some time.  I explained to the two men the work I had\r\nlaid out for them, and stated the sum of money I would give to have\r\nit done, but stipulated that in case of failure there would be no\r\ncompensation whatever beyond the few dollars necessary for their\r\nexpenses.  They readily assented, and it was arranged that they\r\nshould start the following night.  Meanwhile Young had selected his\r\nmen to shadow them, and in two days reported my spies as being\r\nconcealed at Strasburg, where they remained, without making the\r\nslightest effort to continue on their mission, and were busy, no\r\ndoubt, communicating with the enemy, though I was not able to fasten\r\nthis on them.  On the 16th of February they returned to Winchester,\r\nand reported their failure, telling so many lies about their\r\nhazardous adventure as to remove all remaining doubt as to their\r\ndouble-dealing.  Unquestionably they were spies from the enemy, and\r\nhence liable to the usual penalties of such service; but it struck me\r\nthat through them, I might deceive Early as to the time of opening\r\nthe spring campaign, I having already received from General Grant an\r\nintimation of what was expected of me.  I therefore retained the men\r\nwithout even a suggestion of my knowledge of their true character,\r\nYoung meanwhile keeping close watch over all their doings.\r\n\r\nToward the last of February General Early had at Staunton two\r\nbrigades of infantry under Wharton.  All the rest of the infantry\r\nexcept Echol's brigade, which was in southwestern Virginia, had been\r\nsent to Petersburg during the winter, and Fitz. Lee's two brigades of\r\ncavalry also.  Rosser's men were mostly at their homes, where, on\r\naccount of a lack of subsistence and forage in the valley, they had\r\nbeen permitted to go, subject to call.  Lomax's cavalry was at\r\nMillboro, west of Staunton, where supplies were obtainable.  It was\r\nmy aim to get well on the road before Early could collect these\r\nscattered forces, and as many of the officers had been in the habit\r\nof amusing themselves fox-hunting during the latter part of the\r\nwinter, I decided to use the hunt as an expedient for stealing a\r\nmarch on the enemy, and had it given out officially that a grand\r\nfox-chase would take place on the 29th of February.  Knowing that\r\nLomas, and Renfrew would spread the announcement South, they were\r\npermitted to see several red foxes that had been secured, as well as a\r\nlarge pack of hounds which Colonel Young had collected for the sport,\r\nand were then started on a second expedition to burn the bridges.  Of\r\ncourse, they were shadowed as usual, and two days later, after they had\r\ncommunicated with friends from their hiding-place, in Newtown, they\r\nwere arrested.  On the way north to Fort Warren they escaped from their\r\nguards when passing through Baltimore, and I never heard of them again,\r\nthough I learned that, after the assassination of, Mr. Lincoln,\r\nSecretary Stanton strongly suspected his friend Lomas of being\r\nassociated with the conspirators, and it then occurred to me that the\r\ngood-looking Renfrew may have been Wilkes Booth, for he certainly bore\r\na strong resemblance to Booth's pictures.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of February my cavalry entered upon the campaign which\r\ncleared the Shenandoah Valley of every remnant of organized\r\nConfederates.  General Torbert being absent on leave at this time, I\r\ndid not recall him, but appointed General Merritt Chief of Cavalry.\r\nfor Torbert had disappointed me on two important occasions--in the\r\nLuray Valley during the battle of Fisher's Hill, and on the recent\r\nGordonsville expedition--and I mistrusted his ability to conduct any\r\noperations requiring much self-reliance.  The column was composed of\r\nCuster's and Devin's divisions of cavalry, and two sections of\r\nartillery, comprising in all about 10,000 officers and men.  On\r\nwheels we had, to accompany this column, eight ambulances, sixteen\r\nammunition wagons, a pontoon train for eight canvas boats, and a\r\nsmall supply-train, with fifteen days' rations of coffee, sugar, and\r\nsalt, it being intended to depend on the country for the meat and\r\nbread ration, the men carrying in their haversacks nearly enough to\r\nsubsist them till out of the exhausted valley.\r\n\r\nGrant's orders were for me to destroy the Virginia Central railroad\r\nand the James River canal, capture Lynchburg if practicable, and then\r\njoin General Sherman in North Carolina wherever he might be found, or\r\nreturn to Winchester, but as to joining Sherman I was to be governed\r\nby the state of affairs after the projected capture of Lynchburg.\r\nThe weather was cold, the valley and surrounding mountains being\r\nstill covered with snow; but this was fast disappearing, however,\r\nunder the heavy rain that was coming down as the column moved along\r\nup the Valley pike at a steady gait that took us to Woodstock the\r\nfirst day.  The second day we crossed the North Fork of the\r\nShenandoah on our pontoon-bridge, and by night-fall reached Lacy's\r\nSprings, having seen nothing of the enemy as yet but a few partisans\r\nwho hung on our flanks in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nMarch 1 we encountered General Rosser at Mt. Crawford, he having been\r\nable to call together only some five or six hundred of his troops,\r\nour unsuspected march becoming known to Early only the day before.\r\nRosser attempted to delay us here, trying to burn the bridges over\r\nthe Middle Fork of the Shenandoah, but two regiments from Colonel\r\nCapehart's brigade swam the stream and drove Rosser to Kline's Mills,\r\ntaking thirty prisoners and twenty ambulances and wagons.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile General Early was busy at Staunton, but not knowing my\r\nobjective point, he had ordered the return of Echol's brigade from\r\nsouthwestern Virginia for the protection of Lynchburg, directed\r\nLomax's cavalry to concentrate at Pond Gap for the purpose of\r\nharassing me if I moved toward Lynchburg, and at the same time\r\nmarched Wharton's two brigades of infantry, Nelson's artillery, and\r\nRosser's cavalry to Waynesboro', whither he went also to remain till\r\nthe object of my movement was ascertained.\r\n\r\nI entered Staunton the morning of March 2, and finding that Early had\r\ngone to Waynesboro' with his infantry and Rosser, the question at\r\nonce arose whether I should continue my march to Lynchburg direct,\r\nleaving my adversary in my rear, or turn east and open the way\r\nthrough Rockfish Gap to the Virginia Central railroad and James River\r\ncanal.  I felt confident of the success of the latter plan, for I\r\nknew that Early numbered there not more than two thousand men; so,\r\ninfluenced by this, and somewhat also by the fact that Early had left\r\nword in Staunton that he would fight at Waynesboro', I directed\r\nMerritt to move toward that place with Custer, to be closely followed\r\nby Devin, who was to detach one brigade to destroy supplies at\r\nSwoope's depot.  The by-roads were miry beyond description, rain\r\nhaving fallen almost incessantly since we left Winchester, but\r\nnotwithstanding the down-pour the column pushed on, men and horses\r\ngrowing almost unrecognizable from the mud covering them from head to\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nGeneral Early was true to the promise made his friends in Staunton,\r\nfor when Custer neared Waynesboro' he found, occupying a line of\r\nbreastworks on a ridge west of the town, two brigades of infantry,\r\nwith eleven pieces of artillery and Rosser's cavalry.  Custer, when\r\ndeveloping the position of the Confederates, discovered that their\r\nleft was somewhat exposed instead of resting on South River; he\r\ntherefore made his dispositions for attack, sending around that flank\r\nthe dismounted regiments from Pennington's brigade, while he himself,\r\nwith two brigades, partly mounted and partly dismounted, assaulted\r\nalong the whole line of breastworks.  Pennington's flanking movement\r\nstampeded the enemy in short order, thus enabling Custer to carry the\r\nfront with little resistance, and as he did so the Eighth New York\r\nand First Connecticut, in a charge in column, broke through the\r\nopening made by Custer, and continued on through the town of\r\nWaynesboro', never stopping till they crossed South River.  There,\r\nfinding themselves immediately in the enemy's rear, they promptly\r\nformed as foragers and held the east bank of the stream till all the\r\nConfederates surrendered except Rosser, who succeeded in making his\r\nway back to the valley, and Generals Early, Wharton, Long, and\r\nLilley, who, with fifteen or twenty men, escaped across the Blue\r\nRidge.  I followed up the victory immediately by despatching Capehart\r\nthrough Rock-fish Gap, with orders to encamp on the east side of the\r\nBlue Ridge.  By reason of this move all the enemy's stores and\r\ntransportation fell into our hands, while we captured on the field\r\nseventeen battle flags, sixteen hundred officers and men, and eleven\r\npieces of artillery.  This decisive victory closed hostilities in the\r\nShenandoah Valley.  The prisoners and artillery were sent back to\r\nWinchester next morning, under a guard of 1,500 men, commanded by\r\nColonel J.  H.  Thompson, of the First New Hampshire.\r\n\r\nThe night of March 2 Custer camped at Brookfield, Devin remaining at\r\nWaynesboro'.  The former started for Charlottesville the next morning\r\nearly, followed by Devin with but two brigades, Gibbs having been\r\nleft behind to blow up the iron railroad bridge across South River.\r\nBecause of the incessant rains and spring thaws the roads were very\r\nsoft, and the columns cut them up terribly, the mud being thrown by\r\nthe sets of fours across the road in ridges as much as two feet high,\r\nmaking it most difficult to get our wagons along, and distressingly\r\nwearing on the animals toward the middle and rear of the columns.\r\nConsequently I concluded to rest at Charlottesville for a couple of\r\ndays and recuperate a little, intending at the same time to destroy,\r\nwith small parties, the railroad from that point toward Lynchburg.\r\nCuster reached Charlottesville the 3d, in the afternoon, and was met\r\nat the outskirts by a deputation of its citizens, headed by the\r\nmayor, who surrendered the town with medieval ceremony, formally\r\nhanding over the keys of the public buildings and of the University\r\nof Virginia.  But this little scene did not delay Custer long enough\r\nto prevent his capturing, just beyond the village, a small body of\r\ncavalry and three pieces of artillery.  Gibbs's brigade, which was\r\nbringing up my mud-impeded train, did not arrive until the 5th of\r\nMarch.  In the mean time Young's scouts had brought word that the\r\ngarrison of Lynchburg was being increased and the fortifications\r\nstrengthened, so that its capture would be improbable.  I decided,\r\nhowever, to move toward the place as far as Amherst Court House,\r\nwhich is sixteen miles short of the town, so Devin, under Merritt's\r\nsupervision, marched along the James River, destroying the canal,\r\nwhile Custer pushed ahead on the railroad and broke it up.  The two\r\ncolumns were to join at New Market, whence I intended to cross the\r\nJames River at some point east of Lynchburg, if practicable, so as to\r\nmake my way to Appomattox Court House, and destroy the Southside\r\nrailroad as far east as Farmville.  Owing to its swollen condition\r\nthe river was unfordable but knowing that there was a covered bridge\r\nat Duguidsville, I hoped to secure it by a dash, and cross there, but\r\nthe enemy, anticipating this, had filled the bridge with inflammable\r\nmaterial, and just as our troops got within striking distance it\r\nburst into flames.  The bridge at Hardwicksville also having been\r\nburned by the enemy, there was now no means of crossing except by\r\npontoons.  But, unfortunately, I had only eight of these, and they\r\ncould not be made to span the swollen river.\r\n\r\nBeing thus unable to cross until the river should fall, and knowing\r\nthat it was impracticable to join General Sherman, and useless to\r\nadhere to my alternative instructions to return to Winchester, I now\r\ndecided to destroy still more thoroughly the James River canal and\r\nthe Virginia Central railroad and then join General Grant in front of\r\nPetersburg.  I was master of the whole country north of the James as\r\nfar down as Goochland; hence the destruction of these arteries of\r\nsupply could be easily compassed, and feeling that the war was\r\nnearing its end, I desired my cavalry to be in at the death.\r\n\r\nOn March 9 the main column started eastward down the James River,\r\ndestroying locks, dams, and boats, having been preceded by Colonel\r\nFitzhugh's brigade of Devin's division in a forced march to Goochland\r\nand Beaver Dam Creek, with orders to destroy everything below\r\nColumbia.  I made Columbia on the 10th, and from there sent a\r\ncommunication to General Grant reporting what had occurred, informing\r\nhim of my condition and intention, asking him to send forage and\r\nrations to meet me at the White House, and also a pontoon-bridge to\r\ncarry me over the Pamunkey, for in view of the fact that hitherto it\r\nhad been impracticable to hold Lee in the trenches around Petersburg,\r\nI regarded as too hazardous a march down the south bank of the\r\nPamunkey, where the enemy, by sending troops out from Richmond, might\r\nfall upon my flank and rear.  It was of the utmost importance that\r\nGeneral Grant should receive these despatches without chance of\r\nfailure, in order that I might, depend absolutely on securing\r\nsupplies at the White House; therefore I sent the message in\r\nduplicate, one copy overland direct to City Point by two scouts,\r\nCampbell and Rowan, and the other by Fannin and Moore, who were to go\r\ndown the James River in a small boat to Richmond, join the troops in\r\nthe trenches in front of Petersburg, and, deserting to the Union\r\nlines, deliver their tidings into General Grant's hands.  Each set of\r\nmessengers got through, but the copy confided to Campbell and Rowan\r\nwas first at Grant's headquarters.\r\n\r\nI halted for one day at Columbia to let my trains catch up, for it\r\nwas still raining and the mud greatly delayed the teams, fatiguing\r\nand wearying the mules so much that I believe we should have been\r\nforced to abandon most of the wagons except for the invaluable help\r\ngiven by some two thousand negroes who had attached themselves to the\r\ncolumn: they literally lifted the wagons out of the mud.  From\r\nColumbia Merritt, with Devin's division, marched to Louisa Court\r\nHouse and destroyed the Virginia Central to Frederick's Hall.\r\nMeanwhile Custer was performing similar work from Frederick's Hall to\r\nBeaver Dam Station, and also pursued for a time General Early, who,\r\nit was learned from despatches captured in the telegraph office at\r\nFrederick's Hall, was in the neighborhood with a couple of hundred\r\nmen.  Custer captured some of these men and two of Early's\r\nstaff-officers, but the commander of the Valley District, accompanied\r\nby a single orderly, escaped across the South Anna and next day made\r\nhis way to Richmond, the last man of the Confederate army that had so\r\nlong contended with us in the Shenandoah Valley.\r\n\r\nAt Frederick's Hall, Young's scouts brought me word from Richmond\r\nthat General Longstreet was assembling a force there to prevent my\r\njunction with Grant, and that Pickett's division, which had been sent\r\ntoward Lynchburg to oppose my march, and Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry, were\r\nmoving east on the Southside railroad, with the object of\r\ncircumventing me.  Reasoning that Longstreet could interpose\r\neffectually only by getting to the White House ahead of me, I pushed\r\none column under Custer across the South Anna, by way of Ground\r\nSquirrel bridge, to Ashland, where it united with Merritt, who had\r\nmeanwhile marched through Hanover Junction.  Our appearance at\r\nAshland drew the Confederates out in that direction, as was hoped,\r\nso, leaving Colonel Pennington's brigade there to amuse them, the\r\nunited command retraced its route to Mount Carmel church to cross the\r\nNorth Anna.  After dark Pennington came away, and all the troops\r\nreached the church by midnight of the 15th.\r\n\r\nResuming the march at an early hour next morning, we took the road by\r\nway of King William Court House to the White House, where, arriving\r\non the 18th, we found, greatly to our relief, the supplies which I\r\nhad requested to be sent there.  In the meanwhile the enemy had\r\nmarched to Hanover Court House, but being unable either to cross the\r\nPamunkey there or forestall me at the White House on the south side\r\nof the river, he withdrew to Richmond without further effort to\r\nimpede my column.\r\n\r\nThe hardships of this march far exceeded those of any previous\r\ncampaigns by the cavalry.  Almost incessant rains had drenched us for\r\nsixteen days and nights, and the swollen streams and well-nigh\r\nbottomless roads east of Staunton presented grave difficulties on\r\nevery hand, but surmounting them all, we destroyed the enemy's means\r\nof subsistence, in quantities beyond computation, and permanently\r\ncrippled the Virginia Central railroad, as well as the James River\r\ncanal, and as each day brought us nearer the Army of the Potomac, all\r\nwere filled with the comforting reflection that our work in the\r\nShenandoah Valley had been thoroughly done, and every one was buoyed\r\nup by the cheering thought that we should soon take part in the final\r\nstruggle of the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTRANSFERRED TO PETERSBURG--GENERAL RAWLINS CORDIAL WELCOME--GENERAL\r\nGRANT's ORDERS AND PLANS--A TRIP WITH MR. LINCOLN AND GENERAL GRANT\r\n--MEETING GENERAL SHERMAN--OPPOSED TO JOINING THE ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE\r\n--OPENING OF THE APPOMATTOX CAMPAIGN--GENERAL GRANT AND GENERAL RAWLINS.\r\n\r\nThe transfer of my command from the Shenandoah Valley to the field of\r\noperations in front of Petersburg was not anticipated by General\r\nGrant; indeed, the despatch brought from Columbia by my scouts,\r\nasking that supplies be sent me at the White House, was the first\r\nword that reached him concerning the move.  In view of my message the\r\ngeneral-in-chief decided to wait my arrival before beginning spring\r\noperations with the investing troops south of the James River, for he\r\nfelt the importance of having my cavalry at hand in a campaign which\r\nhe was convinced would wind up the war.  We remained a few days at\r\nthe White House resting and refitting the cavalry, a large amount of\r\nshoeing being necessary; but nothing like enough horses were at hand\r\nto replace those that had died or been disabled on the mud march from\r\nStaunton to the Pamunkey River, so a good many of the men were still\r\nwithout mounts, and all such were sent by boat to the dismounted camp\r\nnear City Point.  When all was ready the column set out for Hancock\r\nStation, a point on the military railroad in front of Petersburg, and\r\narriving there on the 27th of March, was in orders reunited with its\r\ncomrades of the Second Division, who had been serving with the Army\r\nof the Potomac since we parted from them the previous August.\r\nGeneral Crook, who had been exchanged within a few days, was now in\r\ncommand of this Second Division.  The reunited corps was to enter\r\nupon the campaign as a separate army, I reporting directly to General\r\nGrant; the intention being thus to reward me for foregoing, of my own\r\nchoice, my position as a department commander by joining the armies\r\nat Petersburg.\r\n\r\nTaking the road across the Peninsula, I started from the White House\r\nwith Merritt's column on the 25th of March and encamped that night at\r\nHarrison's Landing.  Very early next morning, in conformity with a\r\nrequest from General Grant, I left by boat for City Point, Merritt\r\nmeanwhile conducting the column across the James River to the point\r\nof rendezvous, The trip to City Point did not take long, and on\r\narrival at army headquarters the first person I met was General John\r\nA. Rawlins, General Grant's chief-of-staff.  Rawlins was a man of\r\nstrong likes and dislikes, and positive always both in speech and\r\naction, exhibiting marked feelings when greeting any one, and on this\r\noccasion met me with much warmth.  His demonstrations of welcome\r\nover, we held a few minutes' conversation about the coming campaign,\r\nhe taking strong ground against a part of the plan of operations\r\nadopted, namely, that which contemplated my joining General Sherman's\r\narmy.  His language was unequivocal and vehement, and when he was\r\nthrough talking, he conducted me to General Grant's quarters, but he\r\nhimself did not enter.\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant was never impulsive, and always met his officers in an\r\nunceremonious way, with a quiet \"How are you\" soon putting one at his\r\nease, since the pleasant tone in which he spoke gave assurance of\r\nwelcome, although his manner was otherwise impassive.  When the\r\nordinary greeting was over, he usually waited for his visitor to open\r\nthe conversation, so on this occasion I began by giving him the\r\ndetails of my march from Winchester, my reasons for not joining\r\nSherman, as contemplated in my instructions, and the motives which\r\nhad influenced me to march to the White House.  The other provision\r\nof my orders on setting out from Winchester--the alternative return\r\nto that place--was not touched upon, for the wisdom of having ignored\r\nthat was fully apparent.  Commenting on this recital of my doings,\r\nthe General referred only to the tortuous course of my march from\r\nWaynesboro' down, our sore trials, and the valuable services of the\r\nscouts who had brought him tidings of me, closing with the remark\r\nthat it was, rare a department commander voluntarily deprived himself\r\nof independence, and added that I should not suffer for it.  Then\r\nturning to the business for which he had called me to City Point, he\r\noutlined what he expected me to do; saying that I was to cut loose\r\nfrom the Army of the Potomac by passing its left flank to the\r\nsouthward along the line of the Danville railroad, and after crossing\r\nthe Roanoke River, join General Sherman.  While speaking, he handed\r\nme a copy of a general letter of instructions that had been drawn up\r\nfor the army on the 24th.  The letter contained these words\r\nconcerning the movements of my command:\r\n\r\n\"The cavalry under General Sheridan, joined by the division now under\r\nGeneral Davies, will move at the same time (29th inst.) by the Weldon\r\nroad and the Jerusalem plank-road, turning west from the latter\r\nbefore crossing the Nottoway, and west with the whole column before\r\nreaching Stony Creek.  General Sheridan will then move independently\r\nunder other instructions which will be given him.  All dismounted\r\ncavalry belonging to the Army of the Potomac, and the dismounted\r\ncavalry from the Middle Military Division not required for guarding\r\nproperty belonging to their arm of the service, will report to\r\nBrigadier-General Benham to be added to the defenses of City Point.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I had gone over the entire letter I showed plainly that I was\r\ndissatisfied with it, for, coupled with what the General had outlined\r\norally, which I supposed was the \"other instructions,\" I believed it\r\nforeshadowed my junction with General Sherman.  Rawlins thought so\r\ntoo, as his vigorous language had left no room to doubt, so I\r\nimmediately began to offer my objections to the programme.  These\r\nwere, that it would be bad policy to send me down to the Carolinas\r\nwith a part of the Army of the Potomac, to come back to crush Lee\r\nafter the destruction of General Johnston's army; such a course would\r\ngive rise to the charge that his own forces around Petersburg were\r\nnot equal to the task, and would seriously affect public opinion in\r\nthe North; that in fact my cavalry belonged to the Army of the\r\nPotomac, which army was able unaided to destroy Lee, and I could not\r\nbut oppose any dispersion of its strength.\r\n\r\nAll this was said in a somewhat emphatic manner, and when I had\r\nfinished he quietly told me that the portion of my instructions from\r\nwhich I so strongly dissented was intended as a \"blind\" to cover any\r\ncheck the army in its general move, to the left might meet with, and\r\nprevent that element in the North which held that the war could be\r\nended only through negotiation, from charging defeat.  The fact that\r\nmy cavalry was not to ultimately join Sherman was a great relief to\r\nme, and after expressing the utmost confidence in the plans unfolded\r\nfor closing the war by directing every effort to the annihilation of\r\nLee's army, I left him to go to General Ingalls's quarters.  On the\r\nway I again met Rawlins, who, when I told him that General Grant had\r\nintimated his intention to modify the written plan of operations so\r\nfar as regarded the cavalry, manifested the greatest satisfaction,\r\nand I judged from this that the new view of the matter had not\r\npreviously been communicated to the chief-of-staff, though he must\r\nhave been acquainted of course with the programme made out on the\r\n24th of March.\r\n\r\nToward noon General Grant sent for me to accompany him up the river.\r\nWhen I joined the General he informed me that the President was on\r\nboard the boat--the steamer Mary Martin.  For some days Mr. Lincoln\r\nhad been at City Point, established on the steamer River Queen,\r\nhaving come down from Washington to be nearer his generals, no doubt,\r\nand also to be conveniently situated for the reception of tidings\r\nfrom the front when operations began, for he could not endure the\r\ndelays in getting news to Washington.  This trip up the James had\r\nbeen projected by General Meade, but on account of demands at the\r\nfront he could not go, so the President, General Grant, and I\r\ncomposed the party.  We steamed up to where my cavalry was crossing\r\non the pontoon-bridge below the mouth of the Dutch Gap canal, and for\r\na little while watched the column as it was passing over the river,\r\nthe bright sunshine presaging good weather, but only to delude, as\r\nwas proved by the torrents of rain brought by the succeeding days of\r\nMarch.  On the trip the President was not very cheerful.  In fact, he\r\nwas dejected, giving no indication of his usual means of diversion,\r\nby which (his quaint stories) I had often heard he could find relief\r\nfrom his cares.  He spoke to me of the impending operations and asked\r\nmany questions, laying stress upon the one, \"What would be the result\r\nwhen the army moved out to the left, if the enemy should come down\r\nand capture City Point?\" the question being prompted, doubtless, by\r\nthe bold assault on our lines and capture of Fort Steadman two days\r\nbefore by General Gordon.  I answered that I did not think it at all\r\nprobable that General Lee would undertake such a desperate measure to\r\nrelieve the strait he was in; that General Hartranft's successful\r\ncheck to Gordon had ended, I thought, attacks of such a character;\r\nand in any event General Grant would give Lee all he could attend to\r\non the left.  Mr. Lincoln said nothing about my proposed route of\r\nmarch, and I doubt if he knew of my instructions, or was in\r\npossession at most of more than a very general outline of the plan of\r\ncampaign.  It was late when the Mary Martin returned to City Point,\r\nand I spent the night there with General Ingalls.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the 27th I went out to Hancock Station to look after\r\nmy troops and prepare for moving two days later.  In the afternoon I\r\nreceived a telegram from General Grant, saying: \"General Sherman will\r\nbe here this evening to spend a few hours.  I should like to have you\r\ncome down.\"  Sherman's coming was a surprise--at least to me it was\r\n--this despatch being my first intimation of his expected arrival.\r\nWell knowing the zeal and emphasis with which General Sherman would\r\npresent his views, there again came into my mind many misgivings with\r\nreference to the movement of the cavalry, and I made haste to start\r\nfor Grant's headquarters.  I got off a little after 7 o'clock, taking\r\nthe rickety military railroad, the rails of which were laid on the\r\nnatural surface of the ground, with grading only here and there at\r\npoints of absolute necessity, and had not gone far when the\r\nlocomotive jumped the track.  This delayed my arrival at City Point\r\ntill near midnight, but on repairing to the little cabin that\r\nsheltered the general-in-chief, I found him and Sherman still up\r\ntalking over the problem whose solution was near at hand.  As already\r\nstated, thoughts as to the tenor of my instructions became uppermost\r\nthe moment I received the telegram in the afternoon, and they\r\ncontinued to engross and disturb me all the way down the railroad,\r\nfor I feared that the telegram foreshadowed, under the propositions\r\nSherman would present, a more specific compliance with the written\r\ninstructions than General Grant had orally assured me would be\r\nexacted.\r\n\r\nMy entrance into the shanty suspended the conversation for a moment\r\nonly, and then General Sherman, without prelude, rehearsed his plans\r\nfor moving his army, pointing out with every detail how he would come\r\nup through the Carolinas to join the troops besieging Petersburg and\r\nRichmond, and intimating that my cavalry, after striking the\r\nSouthside and Danville railroads, could join him with ease.  I made\r\nno comments on the projects for moving, his own troops, but as soon\r\nas opportunity offered, dissented emphatically from the proposition\r\nto have me join the Army of the Tennessee, repeating in substance\r\nwhat I had previously expressed to General Grant.\r\n\r\nMy uneasiness made me somewhat too earnest, I fear, but General Grant\r\nsoon mollified me, and smoothed matters over by practically repeating\r\nwhat he had told me in regard to this point at the close of our\r\ninterview the day before, so I pursued the subject no further.  In a\r\nlittle while the conference ended, and I again sought lodging at the\r\nhospitable quarters of Ingalls.\r\n\r\nVery early the next morning, while I was still in bed, General\r\nSherman came to me and renewed the subject of my joining him, but\r\nwhen he saw that I was unalterably opposed to it the conversation\r\nturned into other channels, and after we had chatted awhile he\r\nwithdrew, and later in the day went up the river with the President,\r\nGeneral Grant, and Admiral Porter, I returning to my command at\r\nHancock Station, where my presence was needed to put my troops in\r\nmarch next day.\r\n\r\nDuring the entire winter General Grant's lines fronting Petersburg\r\nhad extended south of the Appomattox River, practically from that\r\nstream around to where the Vaughn road crosses Hatcher's Run, and\r\nthis was nearly the situation Wilien the cavalry concentrated at\r\nHancock Station, General Weitzel holding the line north of the\r\nAppomattox, fronting Richmond and Bermuda Hundred.\r\n\r\nThe instructions of the 24th of March contemplated that the campaign\r\nshould begin with the movement of Warren's corps (the Fifth) at\r\n3 o'clock on the morning of the 29th, and Humphreys's (the Second) at\r\n6; the rest of the infantry holding on in the trenches.  The cavalry\r\nwas to move in conjunction with Warren and Humphreys, and make its\r\nway out beyond our left as these corps opened the road.\r\n\r\nThe night of the 28th I received the following additional\r\ninstructions, the general tenor of which again disturbed me, for\r\nalthough I had been assured that I was not to join General Sherman,\r\nit will be seen that the supplemental directions distinctly present\r\nthat alternative, and I therefore feared that during the trip up the\r\nJames River on the morning of the 28th General Grant had returned to\r\nhis original views:\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n\"City Point, Va., March 28, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN:\r\n\r\n\"The Fifth Army Corps will move by the Vaughn road at 3 A.M.\r\ntomorrow morning.  The Second moves at about 9 A.M., having but about\r\nthree miles to march to reach the point designated for it to take on\r\nthe right of the Fifth Corps, after the latter reaches Dinwiddie\r\nCourt House.\r\n\r\n\"Move your cavalry at as early an hour as you can, and without being\r\nconfined to any particular road or roads.  You may go out by the\r\nnearest roads in rear of the Fifth Corps, pass by its left, and\r\npassing near to or through Dinwiddie, reach the right and rear of the\r\nenemy as soon as you can.  It is not the intention to attack the\r\nenemy in his intrenched position, but to force him out if possible.\r\nShould he come out and attack us, or get himself where he can be\r\nattacked, move in with your entire force in your own way, and with\r\nthe full reliance that the army will engage or follow the enemy, as\r\ncircumstances will dictate.  I shall be on the field, and will\r\nprobably be able to communicate with you; should I not do so, and you\r\nfind that the enemy keeps within his main intrenched line, you may\r\ncut loose and push for the Danville road.  If you find it practicable\r\nI would like you to cross the Southside road, between Petersburg and\r\nBurkeville, and destroy it to some extent.  I would not advise much\r\ndetention, however, until you reach the Danville road, which I would\r\nlike you to strike as near to the Appomattox as possible; make your\r\ndestruction of that road as complete as possible; you can then pass\r\non to the Southside road, west of Burkeville, and destroy that in\r\nlike manner.\r\n\r\n\"After having accomplished the destruction of the two railroads,\r\nwhich are now the only avenues of supply to Lee's army, you may\r\nreturn to this army, selecting your road farther south, or you may go\r\non into North Carolina and join General Sherman.  Should you select\r\nthe latter course, get the information to me as early as possible, so\r\nthat I may send orders to meet you at Goldsboro'.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThese instructions did not alter my line of march for the morrow, and\r\nI trusted matters would so come about as not to require compliance\r\nwith those portions relative to the railroads and to joining Sherman;\r\nso early on the 29th I moved my cavalry out toward Ream's Station on\r\nthe Weldon road, Devin commanding the First Division, with Colonels\r\nGibbs, Stagg, and Fitzhugh in charge of the brigades; the Third\r\nDivision under Custer, Colonels Wells, Capehart and Pennington being\r\nthe brigade commanders.  These two divisions united were commanded by\r\nMerritt, as they had been since leaving Winchester.  Crook headed the\r\nSecond Division, his brigades being under General Davies and Colonels\r\nJohn I. Gregg and Smith.\r\n\r\nOur general direction was westward, over such routes as could be\r\nfound, provided they did not embarrass the march of the infantry.\r\nThe roads, from the winter's frosts and rains, were in a frightful\r\nstate, and when it was sought to avoid a spot which the head of the\r\ncolumn had proved almost bottomless, the bogs and quicksands of the\r\nadjoining fields demonstrated that to make a detour was to go from\r\nbad to worse.  In the face of these discouragements we floundered on,\r\nhowever, crossing on the way a series of small streams swollen to\r\ntheir banks.  Crook and Devin reached the county-seat of Dinwiddie\r\nabout 5 o'clock in the evening, having encountered only a small\r\npicket, that at once gave way to our advance.  Merritt left Custer at\r\nMalon's crossing of Rowanty Creek to care for the trains containing\r\nour subsistence and the reserve ammunition, these being stuck in the\r\nmire at, intervals all the way back to the Jerusalem plank-road; and\r\nto make any headway at all with the trains, Custer's men often had to\r\nunload the wagons and lift them out of the boggy places.\r\n\r\nCrook and Devin camped near Dinwiddie Court House in such manner as\r\nto cover the Vaughn, Flatfoot, Boydton, and Five Forks roads; for, as\r\nthese all intersected at Dinwiddie, they offered a chance for the\r\nenemy's approach toward the rear of the Fifth Corps, as Warren\r\nextended to the left across the Boydton road.  Any of these routes\r\nleading to the south or west might also be the one on which, in\r\nconformity with one part of my instructions, I was expected to get\r\nout toward the Danville and Southside railroads, and the Five Forks\r\nroad would lead directly to General Lee's right flank, in case\r\nopportunity was found to comply with the other part.  The place was,\r\ntherefore, of great strategic value, and getting it without cost\r\nrepaid us for floundering through the mud.\r\n\r\nDinwiddie Court House, though a most important point in the campaign,\r\nwas far from attractive in feature, being made up of a half-dozen\r\nunsightly houses, a ramshackle tavern propped up on two sides with\r\npine poles, and the weatherbeaten building that gave official name to\r\nthe cross-roads.  We had no tents--there were none in the command--so\r\nI took possession of the tavern for shelter for myself and staff, and\r\njust as we had finished looking over its primitive interior a rain\r\nstorm set in.\r\n\r\nThe wagon containing my mess equipment was back somewhere on the\r\nroad, hopelessly stuck in the mud, and hence we had nothing to eat\r\nexcept some coffee which two young women living at the tavern kindly\r\nmade for us; a small quantity of the berry being furnished from the\r\nhaversacks of my escort.  By the time we got the coffee, rain was\r\nfalling in sheets, and the evening bade fair to be a most dismal one;\r\nbut songs and choruses set up by some of my staff--the two young\r\nwomen playing accompaniments on a battered piano--relieved the\r\nsituation and enlivened us a little.  However, the dreary night\r\nbrought me one great comfort; for General Grant, who that day had\r\nmoved out to Gravelly Run, sent me instructions to abandon all idea\r\nof the contemplated raid, and directed me to act in concert with the\r\ninfantry under his immediate command, to turn, if possible, the right\r\nflank of Lee's army.  The despatch made my mind easy with respect to\r\nthe objectionable feature of my original instructions, and of course\r\nrelieved me also from the anxiety growing out of the letter received\r\nat Hancock Station the night of the 28th; so, notwithstanding the\r\nsuspicions excited by some of my staff concerning the Virginia\r\nfeather-bed that had been assigned me, I turned in at a late hour and\r\nslept most soundly.\r\n\r\nThe night of the 29th the left of General Grant's infantry--Warren's\r\ncorps--rested on the Boydton road, not far from its intersection with\r\nthe Quaker road.  Humphreys's corps was next to Warren; then came\r\nOrd, next Wright, and then Parke, with his right resting on the\r\nAppomattox.  The moving of Warren and Humphreys to the left during\r\nthe day was early discovered by General Lee.  He met it by extending\r\nthe right of his infantry on the White Oak road, while drawing in the\r\ncavalry of W. H. F. Lee and Rosser along the south bank of Stony\r\nCreek to cover a crossroads called Five Forks, to anticipate me\r\nthere; for assuming that my command was moving in conjunction with\r\nthe infantry, with the ultimate purpose of striking the Southside\r\nrailroad, Lee made no effort to hold Dinwiddie, which he might have\r\ndone with his cavalry, and in this he made a fatal mistake.  The\r\ncavalry of Fitz. Lee was ordered at this same time from Sunderland\r\ndepot to Five Forks, and its chief placed in command of all the\r\nmounted troops of General Lee's army.\r\n\r\nAt daylight on the 30th I proceeded to make dispositions under the\r\nnew conditions imposed by my modified instructions, and directed\r\nMerritt to push Devin out as far as the White Oak road to make a\r\nreconnoissance to Five Forks, Crook being instructed to send Davies's\r\nbrigade to support Devin.  Crook was to hold, with Gregg's brigade,\r\nthe Stony Creek crossing of the Boydton plank road, retaining Smith's\r\nnear Dinwiddie, for use in any direction required.  On the 29th W. H.\r\nF. Lee conformed the march of his cavalry with that of ours, but my\r\nholding Stony Creek in this way forced him to make a detour west of\r\nChamberlin's Run, in order to get in communication with his friends\r\nat Five Forks.\r\n\r\nThe rain that had been falling all night gave no sign of stopping,\r\nbut kept pouring down all day long, and the swamps and quicksands\r\nmired the horses, whether they marched in the roads or across the\r\nadjacent fields.  Undismayed, nevertheless, each column set out for\r\nits appointed duty, but shortly after the troops began to move I\r\nreceived from General Grant this despatch, which put a new phase on\r\nmatters:\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n\"GRAVELLY RUN, March 30, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL SHERIDAN:\r\n\r\n\"The heavy rain of to-day will make it impossible for us to do much\r\nuntil it dries up a little, or we get roads around our rear repaired.\r\nYou may, therefore, leave what cavalry you deem necessary to protect\r\nthe left, and hold such positions as you deem necessary for that\r\npurpose, and send the remainder back to Humphrey's Station where they\r\ncan get hay and grain.  Fifty wagons loaded with forage will be sent\r\nto you in the morning.  Send an officer back to direct the wagons\r\nback to where you want them.  Report to me the cavalry you will leave\r\nback, and the position you will occupy.  Could not your cavalry go\r\nback by the way of Stony Creek depot and destroy or capture the store\r\nof supplies there?\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieut.-General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I had read and pondered this, I determined to ride over to\r\nGeneral Grant's headquarters on Gravelly Run, and get a clear idea of\r\nwhat it was proposed to do, for it seemed to me that a suspension of\r\noperations would be a serious mistake.  Mounting a powerful gray\r\npacing horse called Breckenridge (from its capture from one of\r\nBreckenridge's staff-officers at Missionary Ridge), and that I knew\r\nwould carry me through the mud, I set out accompanied by my Assistant\r\nAdjutant-General, Colonel Frederick C.  Newhall, and an escort of\r\nabout ten or fifteen men.  At first we rode north up the Boydton\r\nplank-road, and coming upon our infantry pickets from a direction\r\nwhere the enemy was expected to appear, they began to fire upon us,\r\nbut seeing from our actions that we were friends, they ceased, and\r\npermitted us to pass the outposts.  We then struggled on in a\r\nnortheasterly direction across-country, till we struck the Vaughn\r\nroad.  This carried us to army headquarters, which were established\r\nsouth of Gravelly Run in an old cornfield.  I rode to within a few\r\nyards of the front of General Grant's tent, my horse plunging at\r\nevery step almost to his knees in the mud, and dismounted near a\r\ncamp-fire, apparently a general one, for all the staff-officers were\r\nstanding around it on boards and rails placed here and there to keep\r\nthem from sinking into the mire.\r\n\r\nGoing directly to General Grant's tent, I found him and Rawlins\r\ntalking over the question of suspending operations till the weather\r\nshould improve.  No orders about the matter had been issued yet,\r\nexcept the despatch to me, and Rawlins, being strongly opposed to the\r\nproposition, was frankly expostulating with General Grant, who, after\r\ngreeting me, remarked, in his quiet way: \"Well, Rawlins, I think you\r\nhad better take command.\"  Seeing that there was a difference up\r\nbetween Rawlins and his chief, I made the excuse of being wet and\r\ncold, and went outside to the fire.  Here General Ingalls met me and\r\ntook me to his tent, where I was much more comfortable than when\r\nstanding outside, and where a few minutes later we were joined by\r\nGeneral Grant.  Ingalls then retired, and General Grant began talking\r\nof our fearful plight, resulting from the rains and mud, and saying\r\nthat because of this it seemed necessary to suspend operations.  I at\r\nonce begged him not to do so, telling him that my cavalry was already\r\non the move in spite of the difficulties, and that although a\r\nsuspension of operations would not be fatal, yet it would give rise\r\nto the very charge of disaster to which he had referred at City\r\nPoint, and, moreover, that we would surely be ridiculed, just as\r\nGeneral Burnside's army was after the mud march of 1863.  His better\r\njudgment was against suspending operations, but the proposition had\r\nbeen suggested by all sorts of complaints as to the impossibility of\r\nmoving the trains and the like, so it needed little argument to\r\nconvince him, and without further discussion he said, in that manner\r\nwhich with him meant a firmness of purpose that could not be changed\r\nby further complainings, \"We will go on.\"  I then told him that I\r\nbelieved I could break in the enemy's right if he would let me have\r\nthe Sixth Corps; but saying that the condition of the roads would\r\nprevent the movement of infantry, he replied that I would have to\r\nseize Five Forks with the cavalry alone.\r\n\r\nOn my way back to Dinwiddie I stopped at the headquarters of General\r\nWarren, but the General being asleep, I went to the tent of one of\r\nhis staff-officers.  Colonel William T. Gentry, an old personal\r\nfriend with whom I had served in Oregon.  In a few minutes Warren\r\ncame in and we had a short conversation, he speaking rather\r\ndespondently of the outlook, being influenced no doubt by the\r\ndepressing weather.\r\n\r\nFrom Warren's headquarters I returned, by the Boydton road to\r\nDinwiddie Court House, fording Gravelly Run with ease.  When I got as\r\nfar as the Dabney road I sent Colonel Newhall out on it toward Five\r\nForks, with orders for Merritt to develop the enemy's position and\r\nstrength, and then rode on to Dinwiddie to endeavor to get all my\r\nother troops up.  Merritt was halted at the intersection of the Five\r\nForks and Gravelly Church roads when Newhall delivered the orders,\r\nand in compliance moving out Gibbs's brigade promptly, sharp\r\nskirmishing was brought on, Gibbs driving the Confederates to Five\r\nForks, where he found them behind a line of breastworks running along\r\nthe White Oak road.  The reconnoissance demonstrating the intention\r\nof the enemy to hold this point, Gibbs was withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThat evening, at 7 o'clock, I reported the position of the\r\nConfederate cavalry, and stated that it had been reinforced by\r\nPickett's division of infantry.  On receipt of this despatch, General\r\nGrant offered me the Fifth Corps, but I declined to take it, and\r\nagain asked for the Sixth, saying that with it I believed I could\r\nturn the enemy (Pickett's) left, or break through his lines.  The\r\nmorning of the 31st General Grant replied the the Sixth Corps could\r\nnot be taken from its position in the line, and offered me the\r\nSecond; but in the mean time circumstances had changed, and no corps\r\nwas ordered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF DINWIDDIE COURT HOUSE--PICKETT REPULSED--REINFORCED BY THE\r\nFIFTH CORPS--BATTLE OF FIVE FORKS--TURNING THE CONFEDERATE LEFT--AN\r\nUNQUALIFIED SUCCESS--RELIEVING GENERAL WARREN--THE WARREN COURT OF\r\nINQUIRY--GENERAL SHERMAN'S OPINION.\r\n\r\nThe night of March 30 Merritt, with Devin's division and Davies's\r\nbrigade, was camped on the Five Forks road about two miles in front\r\nof Dinwiddie, near J. Boisseau's.  Crook, with Smith and Gregg's\r\nbrigades, continued to cover Stony Creek, and Custer was still back\r\nat Rowanty Creek, trying to get the trains up.  This force had been\r\ncounted while crossing the creek on the 29th, the three divisions\r\nnumbering 9,000 enlisted men, Crook having 3,300, and Custer and\r\nDevin 5,700.\r\n\r\nDuring the 30th, the enemy had been concentrating his cavalry, and by\r\nevening General W. H. F. Lee and General Rosser had joined Fitzhugh\r\nLee near Five Forks.  To this force was added, about dark, five\r\nbrigades of infantry--three from Pickett's division, and two from\r\nJohnson's--all under command of Pickett.  The infantry came by the\r\nWhite Oak road from the right of General Lee's intrenchments, and\r\ntheir arrival became positively known to me about dark, the\r\nconfirmatory intelligence being brought in then by some of Young's\r\nscouts who had been inside the Confederate lines.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st, the rain having ceased, directions were given at an\r\nearly hour to both Merritt and Crook to make reconnoissances\r\npreparatory to securing Five Forks, and about 9 o'clock Merritt\r\nstarted for the crossroads, Davies's brigade supporting him.  His\r\nmarch was necessarily slow because of the mud, and the enemy's\r\npickets resisted with obstinacy also, but the coveted crossroads fell\r\nto Merritt without much trouble, as the bulk of the enemy was just\r\nthen bent on other things.  At the same hour that Merritt started,\r\nCrook moved Smith's brigade out northwest from Dinwiddie to\r\nFitzgerald's crossing of Chamberlain's Creek, to cover Merritt's\r\nleft, supporting Smith by placing Gregg to his right and rear.  The\r\noccupation of this ford was timely, for Pickett, now in command of\r\nboth the cavalry and infantry, was already marching to get in\r\nMerritt's rear by crossing Chamberlain's Creek.\r\n\r\nTo hold on to Fitzgerald's ford Smith had to make a sharp fight, but\r\nMumford's cavalry attacking Devin, the enemy's infantry succeeded in\r\ngetting over Chamberlain's Creek at a point higher up than\r\nFitzgerald's ford, and assailing Davies, forced him back in a\r\nnortheasterly direction toward the Dinwiddie and Five Forks road in\r\ncompany with Devin.  The retreat of Davies permitted Pickett to pass\r\nbetween Crook and Merritt, which he promptly did, effectually\r\nseparating them and cutting off both Davies and Devin from the road\r\nto Dinwiddie, so that to get to that point they had to retreat across\r\nthe country to B. Boisseau's and then down the Boydton road.\r\n\r\nGibbs's brigade had been in reserve near the intersection of the Five\r\nForks and Dabney roads, and directing Merritt to hold on there, I\r\nordered Gregg's brigade to be mounted and brought to Merritt's aid,\r\nfor if Pickett continued in pursuit north of the Five Forks road he\r\nwould expose his right and rear, and I determined to attack him, in\r\nsuch case, from Gibbs's position.  Gregg arrived in good season, and\r\nas soon as his men were dismounted on Gibbs's left, Merritt assailed\r\nfiercely, compelling Pickett to halt and face a new foe, thus\r\ninterrupting an advance that would finally have carried Pickett into\r\nthe rear of Warren's corps.\r\n\r\nIt was now about 4 o'clock in the afternoon and we were in a critical\r\nsituation, but having ordered Merritt to bring Devin and Davies to\r\nDinwiddie by the Boydton road, staff-officers were sent to hurry\r\nCuster to the same point, for with its several diverging roads the\r\nCourt House was of vital importance, and I determined to stay there\r\nat all hazards.  At the same time orders were sent to Smith's\r\nbrigade, which, by the advance of Pickett past its right flank and\r\nthe pressure of W. H. F. Lee on its front, had been compelled to give\r\nup Fitzgerald's crossing, to fall back toward Dinwiddie but to\r\ncontest every inch of ground so as to gain time.\r\n\r\nWhen halted by the attack of Gregg and Gibbs, Pickett, desisting from\r\nhis pursuit of Devin, as already stated, turned his undivided\r\nattention to this unexpected force, and with his preponderating\r\ninfantry pressed it back on the Five Forks road toward Dinwiddle,\r\nthough our men, fighting dismounted behind barricades at different\r\npoints, displayed such obstinacy as to make Pickett's progress slow,\r\nand thus give me time to look out a line for defending the Court\r\nHouse.  I selected a place about three-fourths of a mile northwest of\r\nthe crossroads, and Custer coming up quickly with Capehart's brigade,\r\ntook position on the left of the road to Five Forks in some open\r\nground along the crest of a gentle ridge.  Custer got Capehart into\r\nplace just in time to lend a hand to Smith, who, severely pressed,\r\ncame back on us here from his retreat along Chamberlain's \"bed\"--the\r\nvernacular for a woody swamp such as that through which Smith\r\nretired.  A little later the brigades of Gregg and Gibbs, falling to\r\nthe rear slowly and steadily, took up in the woods a line which\r\ncovered the Boydton Road some distance to the right of Capehart, the\r\nintervening gap to be filled with Pennington's brigade.  By this time\r\nour horse-artillery, which for two days had been stuck in the mud,\r\nwas all up, and every gun was posted in this line.\r\n\r\nIt was now near sunset, and the enemy's cavalry thinking the day was\r\ntheirs, made a dash at Smith, but just as the assailants appeared in\r\nthe open fields, Capehart's men opened so suddenly on their left\r\nflank as to cause it to recoil in astonishment, which permitted Smith\r\nto connect his brigade with Custer unmolested.  We were now in good\r\nshape behind the familiar barricades, and having a continuous line,\r\nexcepting only the gap to be filled with Pennington, that covered\r\nDinwiddie and the Boydton Road.  My left rested in the woods about\r\nhalf a mile west of the Court House, and the barricades extended from\r\nthis flank in a semicircle through the open fields in a northeasterly\r\ndirection, to a piece-of thick timber on the right, near the Boydton\r\nRoad.\r\n\r\nA little before the sun went down the Confederate infantry was formed\r\nfor the attack, and, fortunately for us, Pennington's brigade came up\r\nand filled the space to which it was assigned between Capehart and\r\nGibbs, just as Pickett moved out across the cleared fields in front\r\nof Custer, in deep lines that plainly told how greatly we were\r\noutnumbered.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by Generals Merritt and Custer and my staff, I now rode\r\nalong the barricades to encourage the men.  Our enthusiastic\r\nreception showed that they were determined to stay.  The cavalcade\r\ndrew the enemy's fire, which emptied several of the saddles--among\r\nothers Mr. Theodore Wilson, correspondent of the New York Herald,\r\nbeing wounded.  In reply our horse-artillery opened on the advancing\r\nConfederates, but the men behind the barricades lay still till\r\nPickett's troops were within short range.  Then they opened, Custer's\r\nrepeating rifles pouring out such a shower of lead that nothing could\r\nstand up against it.  The repulse was very quick, and as the gray\r\nlines retired to the woods from which but a few minutes before they\r\nhad so confidently advanced, all danger of their taking Dinwiddie or\r\nmarching to the left and rear of our infantry line was over,\r\nat least for the night.  The enemy being thus checked, I sent a\r\nstaff-officer--Captain Sheridan--to General Grant to report what had\r\ntaken place during the afternoon, and to say that I proposed to stay at\r\nDinwiddie, but if ultimately compelled to abandon the place, I would do\r\nso by retiring on the Vaughn road toward Hatcher's Run, for I then\r\nthought the attack might be renewed next morning.  Devin and Davies\r\njoined me about dark, and my troops being now well in hand, I sent a\r\nsecond staff-officer--Colonel John Kellogg--to explain my situation\r\nmore fully, and to assure General Grant that I would hold on at\r\nDinwiddie till forced to let go.\r\n\r\nBy following me to Dinwiddie the enemy's infantry had completely\r\nisolated itself, and hence there was now offered the Union troops a\r\nrare opportunity.  Lee was outside of his works, just as we desired,\r\nand the general-in-chief realized this the moment he received the\r\nfirst report of my situation; General Meade appreciated it too from\r\nthe information he got from Captain Sheridan, en route to army\r\nheadquarters with the first tidings, and sent this telegram to\r\nGeneral Grant:\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,\r\n\"March 31, 1865.  9:45 p.m.\r\n\r\n\"LIEUTENANT-GENERAL GRANT:\r\n\r\n\"Would it not be well for Warren to go down with his whole corps and\r\nsmash up the force in front of Sheridan?  Humphreys can hold the line\r\nto the Boydton plank-road, and the refusal along with it.  Bartlett's\r\nbrigade is now on the road from G. Boisseau's, running north, where\r\nit crosses Gravelly Run, he having gone down the White Oak road.\r\nWarren could go at once that way, and take the force threatening\r\nSheridan in rear at Dinwiddie, and move on the enemy's rear with the\r\nother two.\r\n\r\n\"G. G. MEADE, Major-General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAn hour later General Grant replied in these words:\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n\"DABNEY'S MILLS, March 311, 1865.  10:15 P. M.\r\n\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL MEADE,\r\n\"Commanding Army of the Potomac.\r\n\r\nLet Warren move in the way you propose, and urge him not to stop for\r\nanything.  Let Griffin (Griffin had been ordered by Warren to the\r\nBoydton road to protect his rear) go on as he was first directed.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT, Lieutenant-General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThese two despatches were the initiatory steps in sending the Fifth\r\nCorps, under Major-General G. K. Warren, to report to me, and when I\r\nreceived word of its coming and also that Genera Mackenzie's cavalry\r\nfrom the Army of the James was likewise to be added to my command,\r\nand that discretionary authority was given me to use all my forces\r\nagainst Pickett, I resolved to destroy him, if it was within the\r\nbounds of possibility, before he could rejoin Lee.\r\n\r\nIn a despatch, dated 10:05 p.m., telling me of the coming of Warren\r\nand Mackenzie, General Grant also said that the Fifth Corps should\r\nreach me by 12 o'clock that night, but at that hour not only had none\r\nof the corps arrived, but no report from it, so believing that if it\r\ncame all the way down to Dinwiddie the next morning, our opportunity\r\nwould be gone, I concluded that it would be best to order Warren to\r\nmove in on the enemy's rear while the cavalry attacked in front, and,\r\ntherefore, at 3 o'clock in the morning of April 1 sent this despatch\r\nto General Warren:\r\n\r\n\"CAVALRY HEADQUARTERS, DINWIDDIE C. H.,\r\n\"April 1, 1865--3. A.M.\r\n\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL WARREN,\r\n\"Commanding Fifth Army Corps.\r\n\r\n\"I am holding in front of Dinwiddie Court House, on the road leading\r\nto Five Forks, for three-quarters of a mile with General Custer's\r\ndivision.  The enemy are in his immediate front, lying so as to cover\r\nthe road just this side of A. Adams's house, which leads across\r\nChamberlain's bed, or run.  I understand you have a division at J.[G]\r\nBoisseau's; if so, you are in rear of the enemy's line and almost on\r\nhis flank.  I will hold on here.  Possibly they may attack Custer at\r\ndaylight; if so, attack instantly and in full force.  Attack at\r\ndaylight anyhow, and I will make an effort to get the road this side\r\nof Adams's house, and if I do, you can capture the whole of them.\r\nAny force moving down the road I am holding, or on the White Oak\r\nroad, will be in the enemy's rear, and in all probability get any\r\nforce that may escape you by a flank movement.  Do not fear my\r\nleaving here.  If the enemy remains, I shall fight at daylight.\r\n\r\n\"P. H. SHERIDAN, Major-General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWith daylight came a slight fog, but it lifted almost immediately,\r\nand Merritt moved Custer and Devin forward.  As these divisions\r\nadvanced the enemy's infantry fell back on the Five Forks road, Devin\r\npressing him along the road, while Custer extended on the left over\r\ntoward Chamberlain's Run, Crook being held in watch along Stony\r\nCreek, meanwhile, to be utilized as circumstances might require when\r\nWarren attacked.\r\n\r\nThe order of General Meade to Warren the night of March 31--a copy\r\nbeing sent me also--was positive in its directions, but as midnight\r\ncame without a sign of or word from the Fifth Corps, notwithstanding\r\nthat was the hour fixed for its arrival, I nevertheless assumed that\r\nthere were good reasons for its non-appearance, but never once\r\ndoubted that measures would be taken to comply with my despatch Of\r\n3 A. M. and therefore hoped that, as Pickett was falling back slowly\r\ntoward Five Forks, Griffin's and Crawford's divisions would come in\r\non the Confederate left and rear by the Crump road near J.[G]\r\nBoisseau's house.\r\n\r\nBut they did not reach there till after the enemy had got by.  As a\r\nmatter of fact, when Pickett was passing the all-important point\r\nWarren's men were just breaking from the bivouac in which their chief\r\nhad placed them the night before, and the head of Griffin's division\r\ndid not get to Boisseau's till after my cavalry, which meanwhile had\r\nbeen joined by Ayres's division of the Fifth Corps by way of the\r\nBoydton and Dabney roads.  By reason of the delay in moving Griffin\r\nand Crawford, the enemy having escaped, I massed the Fifth Corps at\r\nJ.[G] Boisseau's so that the men could be rested, and directed it to\r\nremain there; General Warren himself had not then come up.  General\r\nMackenzie, who had reported just after daybreak, was ordered at first\r\nto stay at Dinwiddie Court House, but later was brought along the\r\nFive Forks road to Dr. Smith's, and Crook's division was directed to\r\ncontinue watching the crossings of Stony Creek and Chamberlain's Run.\r\n\r\nThat we had accomplished nothing but to oblige our foe to retreat was\r\nto me bitterly disappointing, but still feeling sure that he would\r\nnot give up the Five Forks crossroads without a fight, I pressed him\r\nback there with Merritt's cavalry, Custer advancing on the Scott\r\nroad, while Devin drove the rearguard along that leading from J.[G]\r\nBoisseau's to Five Forks.\r\n\r\nBy 2 o'clock in the afternoon Merritt had forced the enemy inside his\r\nintrenchments, which began with a short return about three-quarters\r\nof a mile east of the Forks and ran along the south side of the White\r\nOak road to a point about a mile west of the Forks.  From the left of\r\nthe return over toward Hatcher's Run was posted Mumford's cavalry,\r\ndismounted.  In the return itself was Wallace's brigade, and next on\r\nits right came Ransom's, then Stewart's, then Terry's, then Corse's.\r\nOn the right of Corse was W. H. F. Lee's division of cavalry.  Ten\r\npieces of artillery also were in this line, three on the right of the\r\nworks, three near the centre at the crossroads, and four on the left,\r\nin the return.  Rosser's cavalry was guarding the Confederate trains\r\nnorth of Hatcher's Run beyond the crossing of the Ford road.\r\n\r\nI felt certain the enemy would fight at Five Forks--he had to--so,\r\nwhile we were getting up to his intrenchments, I decided on my plan\r\nof battle.  This was to attack his whole front with Merritt's two\r\ncavalry divisions, make a feint of turning his right flank, and with\r\nthe Fifth Corps assail his left.  As the Fifth Corps moved into\r\naction, its right flank was to be covered by Mackenzie's cavalry,\r\nthus entirely cutting off Pickett's troops from communication with\r\nLee's right flank, which rested near the Butler house at the junction\r\nof the Claiborne and White Oaks roads.  In execution of this plan,\r\nMerritt worked his men close in toward the intrenchments, and while\r\nhe was thus engaged, I ordered Warren to bring up the Fifth Corps,\r\nsending the order by my engineer officer, Captain Gillespie, who had\r\nreconnoitred the ground in the neighborhood of Gravelly Run Church,\r\nwhere the infantry was to form for attack.\r\n\r\nGillespie delivered the order about 1 o'clock, and when the corps was\r\nput in motion, General Warren joined me at the front.  Before he\r\ncame, I had received, through Colonel Babcock, authority from General\r\nGrant to relieve him, but I did not wish to do it, particularly on\r\nthe eve of battle; so, saying nothing at all about the message\r\nbrought me, I entered at once on the plan for defeating Pickett,\r\ntelling Warren how the enemy was posted, explaining with considerable\r\ndetail, and concluding by stating that I wished his troops to be\r\nformed on the Gravelly Church road, near its junction with the White\r\nOak road, with two divisions to the front, aligned obliquely to the\r\nWhite Oak road, and one in reserve, opposite the centre of these two.\r\n\r\nGeneral Warren seemed to understand me clearly, and then left to join\r\nhis command, while I turned my attention to the cavalry, instructing\r\nMerritt to begin by making demonstrations as though to turn the\r\nenemy's right, and to assault the front of the works with his\r\ndismounted cavalry as soon as Warren became engaged.  Afterward I\r\nrode around to Gravelly Run Church, and found the head of Warren's\r\ncolumn just appearing, while he was sitting under a tree making a\r\nrough sketch of the ground.  I was disappointed that more of the\r\ncorps was not already up, and as the precious minutes went by without\r\nany apparent effort to hurry the troops on to the field, this\r\ndisappointment grew into disgust.  At last I expressed to Warren my\r\nfears that the cavalry might expend all their ammunition before the\r\nattack could be made, that the sun would go down before the battle\r\ncould be begun, or that troops from Lee's right, which, be it\r\nremembered, was less than three miles away from my right, might, by\r\nstriking my rear, or even by threatening it, prevent the attack on\r\nPickett.\r\n\r\nWarren did not seem to me to be at all solicitous; his manner\r\nexhibited decided apathy, and he remarked with indifference that\r\n\"Bobby Lee was always getting people into trouble.\"  With unconcern\r\nsuch as this, it is no wonder that fully three hours' time was\r\nconsumed in marching his corps from J.[G]  Boisseau's to Gravelly Run\r\nChurch, though the distance was but two miles.  However, when my\r\npatience was almost worn out, Warren reported his troops ready,\r\nAyres's division being formed on the west side of the Gravelly Church\r\nroad, Crawford's on the east side, and Griffin in reserve behind the\r\nright of Crawford, a little different from my instructions.  The\r\ncorps had no artillery present, its batteries, on account of the mud,\r\nbeing still north of Gravelly Run.  Meanwhile Merritt had been busy\r\nworking his men close up to the intrenchments from the angle of the\r\nreturn west, along the White Oak road.\r\n\r\nAbout 4 o'clock Warren began the attack.  He was to assault the left\r\nflank of the Confederate infantry at a point where I knew Pickett's\r\nintrenchments were refused, almost at right angles with the White Oak\r\nroad.  I did not know exactly how far toward Hatcher's Run this part\r\nof the works extended, for here the videttes of Mumford's cavalry\r\nwere covering, but I did know where the refusal began.  This return,\r\nthen, was the point I wished to assail, believing that if the assault\r\nwas made with spirit, the line could be turned.  I therefore intended\r\nthat Ayres and Crawford should attack the refused trenches squarely,\r\nand when these two divisions and Merritt's cavalry became hotly\r\nengaged, Griffin's division was to pass around the left of the\r\nConfederate line; and I personally instructed Griffin how I wished\r\nhim to go in, telling him also that as he advanced, his right flank\r\nwould be taken care of by Mackenzie, who was to be pushed over toward\r\nthe Ford road and Hatcher's Run.\r\n\r\nThe front of the corps was oblique to the White Oak road; and on\r\ngetting there, it was to swing round to the left till perpendicular\r\nto the road, keeping closed to the left.  Ayres did his part well,\r\nand to the letter, bringing his division square up to the front of\r\nthe return near the angle; but Crawford did not wheel to the left, as\r\nwas intended.  On the contrary, on receiving fire from Mumford's\r\ncavalry, Crawford swerved to the right and moved north from the\r\nreturn, thus isolating his division from Ayres; and Griffin,\r\nuncertain of the enemy's position, naturally followed Crawford.\r\n\r\nThe deflection of this division on a line of march which finally\r\nbrought it out on the Ford road near C. Young's house, frustrated the\r\npurpose I had in mind when ordering the attack, and caused a gap\r\nbetween Ayres and Crawford, of which the enemy quickly took\r\nadvantage, and succeeded in throwing a part of Ayres's division into\r\nconfusion.  At this juncture I sent word to General Warren to have\r\nCrawford recalled; for the direction he was following was not only a\r\nmistaken one, but, in case the assault at the return failed, he ran\r\ngreat risk of capture.  Warren could not be found, so I then sent for\r\nGriffin--first by Colonel Newhall, and then by Colonel Sherman--to\r\ncome to the aid of Ayres, who was now contending alone with that part\r\nof the enemy's infantry at the return.  By this time Griffin had\r\nobserved and appreciated Crawford's mistake, however, and when the\r\nstaff-officers reached him, was already faced to the left; so,\r\nmarching across Crawford's rear, he quickly joined Ayres, who\r\nmeanwhile had rallied his troops and carried the return.\r\n\r\nWhen Ayres's division went over the flank of the enemy's works,\r\nDevin's division of cavalry, which had been assaulting the front,\r\nwent over in company with it; and hardly halting to reform, the\r\nintermingling infantry and dismounted cavalry swept down inside the\r\nintrenchments, pushing to and beyond Five Forks, capturing thousands\r\nof prisoners.  The only stand the enemy tried to make was when he\r\nattempted to form near the Ford road.  Griffin pressed him so hard\r\nthere, however, that he had to give way in short order, and many of\r\nhis men, with three pieces of artillery, fell into the hands of\r\nCrawford while on his circuitous march.\r\n\r\nThe right of Custer's division gained a foothold on the enemy's works\r\nsimultaneously with Devin's, but on the extreme left Custer had a\r\nvery severe combat with W. H. F. Lee's cavalry, as well as with\r\nCorse's and Terry's infantry.  Attacking Terry and Corse with\r\nPennington's brigade dismounted, he assailed Lee's cavalry with his\r\nother two brigades mounted, but Lee held on so obstinately that\r\nCuster gained but little ground till our troops, advancing behind the\r\nworks, drove Corse and Terry out.  Then Lee made no further stand\r\nexcept at the west side of the Gillian field, where, assisted by\r\nCorse's brigade, he endeavored to cover the retreat, but just before\r\ndark Custer, in concert with some Fifth Corps regiments under Colonel\r\nRichardson, drove ihe last of the enemy westward on the White Oak\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nOur success was unqualified; we had overthrown Pickett, taken six\r\nguns, thirteen battle-flags, and nearly six thousand prisoners.  When\r\nthe battle was practically over, I turned to consider my position\r\nwith reference to the main Confederate army.  My troops, though\r\nvictorious, were isolated from the Army of the Potomac, for on the\r\n31st of March the extreme left of that army had been thrown back\r\nnearly to the Boydton plank-road, and hence there was nothing to\r\nprevent the enemy's issuing from his trenches at the intersection of\r\nthe White Oak and Claiborne roads and marching directly on my rear.\r\nI surmised that he might do this that night or early next morning.\r\nIt was therefore necessary to protect myself in this critical\r\nsituation, and General Warren having sorely disappointed me, both in\r\nthe moving of his corps and in its management during the battle, I\r\nfelt that he was not the man to rely upon under such circumstances,\r\nand deeming that it was to the best interest of the service as well\r\nas but just to myself, I relieved him, ordering him to report to\r\nGeneral Grant.\r\n\r\nI then put Griffin in command of the Fifth Corps, and directed him to\r\nwithdraw from the pursuit as quickly as he could after following the\r\nenemy a short distance, and form in line of battle near Gravelly Run\r\nChurch, at right angles with the White Oak road, with Ayres and\r\nCrawford facing toward the enemy at the junction of the White Oak and\r\nClaiborne roads, leaving Bartlett, now commanding Griffin's division,\r\nnear the Ford road.  Mackenzie also was left on the Ford road at the\r\ncrossing of Hatcher's Run, Merritt going into camp on the Widow\r\nGillian's plantation.  As I had been obliged to keep Crook's division\r\nalong Stony Creek throughout the day, it had taken no active part in\r\nthe battle.\r\n\r\nYears after the war, in 1879, a Court of Inquiry was given General\r\nWarren in relation to his conduct on the day of the battle.  He\r\nassumed that the delay in not granting his request for an inquiry,\r\nwhich was first made at the close of the war, was due to opposition\r\non my part.  In this he was in error; I never opposed the ordering of\r\nthe Court, but when it was finally decided to convene it I naturally\r\nasked to be represented by counsel, for the authorization of the\r\nInquiry was so peculiarly phrased that it made me practically a\r\nrespondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"NEW YORK CITY, May 3, 1880\r\n\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL W. S. HANCOCK, U. S. A.\r\n\"President Court of Inquiry, Governor's Island.\r\n\r\n\"Sir: Since my arrival in this city, under a subpoena to appear and\r\ntestify before the Court of which you are president, I have been\r\nindirectly and unofficially informed that the Court some time ago\r\nforwarded an invitation to me (which has not been received) to appear\r\npersonally or by counsel, in order to aid it in obtaining a knowledge\r\nas to the facts concerning the movements terminating in the battle of\r\n'Five Forks,' with reference to the direct subjects of its inquiry.\r\nAny invitation of this character I should always and do consider it\r\nincumbent on me to accede to, and do everything in my power in\r\nfurtherance of the specific purposes for which courts of inquiry are\r\nby law instituted.\r\n\r\n\"The order convening the Court (a copy of which was not received by\r\nme at my division headquarters until two days after the time\r\nappointed for the Court to assemble) contemplates an inquiry based on\r\nthe application of Lieutenant Colonel G. K. Warren, Corps of\r\nEngineers, as to his conduct while major-general commanding the Fifth\r\nArmy Corps, under my command, in reference to accusations or\r\nimputations assumed in the order to have been made against him, and I\r\nunderstand through the daily press that my official report of the\r\nbattle of Five Forks has been submitted by him as a basis of inquiry.\r\n\r\n\"If it is proposed to inquire, either directly or indirectly, as to\r\nany action of mine so far as the commanding general Fifth Army Corps\r\nwas concerned, or my motives for such action, I desire to be\r\nspecifically informed wherein such action or transaction is alleged\r\nto contain an accusation or imputation to become a subject of\r\ninquiry, so that, knowing what issues are raised, I may intelligently\r\naid the Court in arriving at the facts.\r\n\r\n\"It is a long time since the battle of Five Forks was fought, and\r\nduring the time that has elapsed the official reports of that battle\r\nhave been received and acknowledged by the Government; but now, when\r\nthe memory of events has in many instances grown dim, and three of\r\nthe principal actors on that field are dead--Generals Griffin,\r\nCuster, and Devin, whose testimony would have been valuable--an\r\ninvestigation is ordered which might perhaps do injustice unless the\r\nfacts pertinent to the issues are fully developed.\r\n\r\n\"My duties are such that it will not be convenient for me to be\r\npresent continuously during the sessions of the Court.  In order,\r\nhowever, that everything may be laid before it in my power pertinent\r\nto such specific issues as are legally raised, I beg leave to\r\nintroduce Major Asa Bird Gardner as my counsel.\r\n\r\n\"Very respectfully,\r\n\r\n\"P. H. SHERIDAN, Lieut.-General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBriefly stated, in my report of the battle of Five Forks there were\r\nfour imputations concerning General Warren.  The first implied that\r\nWarren failed to reach me on the 1st of April, when I had reason to\r\nexpect him; the second, that the tactical handling of his corps was\r\nunskillful; the third, that he did not exert himself to get his corps\r\nup to Gravelly Run Church; and the fourth, that when portions of his\r\nline gave way he did not exert himself to restore confidence to his\r\ntroops.  The Court found against him on the first and second counts,\r\nand for him on the third and fourth.  This finding was unsatisfactory\r\nto General Warren, for he hoped to obtain such an unequivocal\r\nrecognition of his services as to cast discredit on my motives for\r\nrelieving him.  These were prompted by the conditions alone--by the\r\nconduct of General Warren as described, and my consequent lack of\r\nconfidence in him.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that in my conversation with General Grant on\r\nthe 30th, relative to the suspension of operations because of the\r\nmud, I asked him to let me have the Sixth Corps to help me in\r\nbreaking in on the enemy's right, but that it could not be sent me;\r\nit will be recalled also that the Fifth Corps was afterward tendered\r\nand declined.  From these facts it has been alleged that I was\r\nprejudiced against General Warren, but this is not true.  As we had\r\nnever been thrown much together I knew but little of him.  I had no\r\npersonal objection to him, and certainly could have none to his\r\ncorps.  I was expected to do an extremely dangerous piece of work,\r\nand knowing the Sixth Corps well--my cavalry having campaigned with\r\nit so successfully in the Shenandoah Valley, I naturally preferred\r\nit, and declined the Fifth for no other reason.  But the Sixth could\r\nnot be given, and the turn of events finally brought me the Fifth\r\nafter my cavalry, under the most trying difficulties, had drawn the\r\nenemy from his works, and into such a position as to permit the\r\nrealization of General Grant's hope to break up with my force Lee's\r\nright flank.  Pickett's isolation offered an opportunity which we\r\ncould not afford to neglect, and the destruction of his command would\r\nfill the measure of General Grant's expectations as well as meet my\r\nown desires.  The occasion was not an ordinary one, and as I thought\r\nthat Warren had not risen to its demand in the battle, I deemed it\r\ninjudicious and unsafe under the critical conditions existing to\r\nretain him longer.  That I was justified in this is plain to all who\r\nare disposed to be fair-minded, so with the following extract from\r\nGeneral Sherman's review of the proceedings of the Warren Court, and\r\nwith which I am convinced the judgment of history will accord, I\r\nleave the subject:\r\n\r\n\"....It would be an unsafe and dangerous rule to hold the commander\r\nof an army in battle to a technical adherence to any rule of conduct\r\nfor managing his command.  He is responsible for results, and holds\r\nthe lives and reputations of every officer and soldier under his\r\norders as subordinate to the great end--victory.  The most important\r\nevents are usually compressed into an hour, a minute, and he cannot\r\nstop to analyze his reasons.  He must act on the impulse, the\r\nconviction, of the instant, and should be sustained in his\r\nconclusions, if not manifestly unjust.  The power to command men, and\r\ngive vehement impulse to their joint action, is something which\r\ncannot be defined by words, but it is plain and manifest in battles,\r\nand whoever commands an army in chief must choose his subordinates by\r\nreason of qualities which can alone be tested in actual conflict.\r\n\r\n\"No one has questioned the patriotism, integrity, and great\r\nintelligence of General Warren.  These are attested by a long record\r\nof most excellent service, but in the clash of arms at and near Five\r\nForks, March 31 and April 1, 1865, his personal activity fell short\r\nof the standard fixed by General Sheridan, on whom alone rested the\r\ngreat responsibility for that and succeeding days.\r\n\r\n\"My conclusion is that General Sheridan was perfectly justified in\r\nhis action in this case, and he must be fully and entirely sustained\r\nif the United States expects great victories by her arms in the\r\nfuture.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nRESULT OF THE BATTLE OF FIVE FORKS--RETREAT OF LEE--AN INTERCEPTED\r\nDESPATCH--AT AMELIA COURT HOUSE--BATTLE OF SAILOR'S CREEK--THE\r\nCONFEDERATES' STUBBORN RESISTANCE--A COMPLETE VICTORY--IMPORTANCE OF\r\nTHE BATTLE.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of the battle at Five Forks reached General Grant, he\r\nrealized that the decisive character of our victory would necessitate\r\nthe immediate abandonment of Richmond and Petersburg by the enemy;\r\nand fearing that Lee would escape without further injury, he issued\r\norders, the propriety of which must be settled by history, to assault\r\nnext morning the whole intrenched line.  But Lee could not retreat at\r\nonce.  He had not anticipated dissster at Five Forks, and hence was\r\nunprepared to withdraw on the moment; and the necessity of getting\r\noff his trains and munitions of war, as well as being obliged to\r\ncover the flight of the Confederate Government, compelled him to hold\r\non to Richmond and Petersburg till the afternoon of the 2d, though\r\nbefore that Parke, Ord, and Wright had carried his outer\r\nintrenchments at several points, thus materially shortening the line\r\nof investment.\r\n\r\nThe night of the 1st of April, General Humphreys's corps--the Second\r\n--had extended its left toward the White Oak road, and early next\r\nmorning, under instructions from General Grant, Miles's division of\r\nthat corps reported to me, and supporting him with Ayres's and\r\nCrawford's divisions of the Fifth Corps, I then directed him to\r\nadvance toward Petersburg and attack the enemy's works at the\r\nintersection of the Claiborne and White Oak roads.\r\n\r\nSuch of the enemy as were still in the works Miles easily forced\r\nacross Hatcher's Run, in the direction of Sutherland's depot, but the\r\nConfederates promptly took up a position north of the little stream,\r\nand Miles being anxious to attack, I gave him leave, but just at this\r\ntime General Humphreys came up with a request to me from General\r\nMeade to return Miles.  On this request I relinquished command of the\r\ndivision, when, supported by the Fifth Corps it could have broken in\r\nthe enemy's right at a vital point; and I have always since regretted\r\nthat I did so, for the message Humphreys conveyed was without\r\nauthority from General Grant, by whom Miles had been sent to me, but\r\nthinking good feeling a desideratum just then, and wishing to avoid\r\nwrangles, I faced the Fifth Corps about and marched it down to Five\r\nForks, and out the Ford road to the crossing of Hatcher's Run.  After\r\nwe had gone, General Grant, intending this quarter of the field to be\r\nunder my control, ordered Humphreys with his other two divisions to\r\nmove to the right, in toward Petersburg.  This left Miles entirely\r\nunsupported, and his gallant attack made soon after was unsuccessful\r\nat first, but about 3 o'clock in the afternoon he carried the point\r\nwhich covered the retreat from Petersburg and Richmond.\r\n\r\nMerritt had been sent westward, meanwhile, in the direction of Ford's\r\nStation, to break the enemy's horse which had been collecting to the\r\nnorth of Hatcher's Run.  Meeting, with but little opposition, Merritt\r\ndrove this cavalry force in a northerly direction toward Scott's\r\nCorners, while the Fifth Corps was pushed toward Sutherland's depot,\r\nin the hope of coming in on the rear of the force that was\r\nconfronting Miles when I left him.  Crawford and Merritt engaged the\r\nenemy lightly just before night, but his main column, retreating\r\nalong the river road south of the Appomattox, had got across Namozine\r\nCreek, and the darkness prevented our doing more than to pick up some\r\nstragglers.  The next morning the pursuit was resumed, the cavalry\r\nagain in advance, the Fifth Corps keeping up with it all the while,\r\nand as we pressed our adversaries hundreds and hundreds of prisoners,\r\narmed and unarmed, fell into our hands, together with many wagons and\r\nfive pieces of artillery.  At Deep Creek the rearguard turned on us,\r\nand a severe skirmish took place.  Merritt, finding the enemy very\r\nstrong, was directed to await the arrival of Crook and for the rear\r\ndivision of the Fifth Corps; but by the time they reached the creek,\r\ndarkness had again come to protect the Confederates, and we had to be\r\ncontent with meagre results at that point.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning it was apparent that Lee, in his retreat, was\r\nmaking for Amelia Court House, where his columns north and south of\r\nthe Appomattox River could join, and where, no doubt, he expected to\r\nmeet supplies, so Crook was ordered to march early on April 4 to\r\nstrike the Danville railroad, between Jettersville and Burkeville,\r\nand then move south along the railroad toward Jettersville, Merritt\r\nto move toward Amelia Court House, and the Fifth Corps to\r\nJettersville itself.\r\n\r\nThe Fifth Corps got to Jettersville about 5 in the afternoon, and I\r\nimmediately intrenched it across the Burkeville road with the\r\ndetermination to stay there till the main army could come up, for I\r\nhoped we could force Lee to surrender at Amelia Court House, since a\r\nfirm hold on Jettersville would cut him off from his line of retreat\r\ntoward Burkeville.\r\n\r\nAccompanied only by my escort--the First United States Cavalry, about\r\ntwo hundred strong--I reached Jettersville some little time before\r\nthe Fifth Corps, and having nothing else at hand I at once deployed\r\nthis handful of men to cover the crossroads till the arrival of the\r\ncorps.  Just as the troopers were deploying, a man on a mule, heading\r\nfor Burkeville, rode into my pickets.  He was arrested, of course,\r\nand being searched there was found in his boots this telegram in\r\nduplicate, signed by Lee's Commissary General.\r\n\r\n\"The army is at Amelia Court House, short of provisions.  Send\r\n300,000 rations quickly to Burkeville Junction.\" One copy was\r\naddressed to the supply department at Danville, and the other to that\r\nat Lynchburg.  I surmised that the telegraph lines north of\r\nBurkeville had been broken by Crook after the despatches were\r\nwritten, which would account for their being transmitted by\r\nmessenger.  There was thus revealed not only the important fact that\r\nLee was concentrating at Amelia Court House, but also a trustworthy\r\nbasis for estimating his troops, so I sent word to Crook to strike up\r\nthe railroad toward me, and to Merritt--who, as I have said, had\r\nfollowed on the heels of the enemy--to leave Mackenzie there and\r\nhimself close in on Jettersville.  Staff-officers were also\r\ndespatched to hurry up Griffin with the Fifth Corps, and his tired men\r\nredoubled their strides.\r\n\r\nMy troops too were hard up for rations, for in the pursuit we could\r\nnot wait for our trains, so I concluded to secure if possible these\r\nprovisions intended for Lee.  To this end I directed Young to send\r\nfour of his best scouts to Burkeville Junction.  There they were to\r\nseparate, two taking the railroad toward Lynchburg and two toward\r\nDanville, and as soon as a telegraph station was reached the telegram\r\nwas to be transmitted as it had been written and the provisions thus\r\nhurried forward.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Fifth Corps arrived at Jettersville the evening of April\r\n4, as did also Crook's and Merritt's cavalry, yet none of the army of\r\nthe Potomac came up till about 3 o'clock the afternoon of the 5th,\r\nthe Second Corps, followed by the Sixth, joining us then.  General\r\nMeade arrived at Jettersville an hour earlier, but being ill,\r\nrequested me to put his troops in position.  The Fifth Corps being\r\nalready intrenched across the Amelia Court House road facing north, I\r\nplaced the Sixth on its right and the Second on its left as they\r\nreached the ground.\r\n\r\nAs the enemy had been feeling us ever since morning--to learn what he\r\nwas up to I directed Crook to send Davies's brigade on a\r\nreconnoissance to Paine's crossroads.  Davies soon found out that Lee\r\nwas trying to escape by that flank, for at the crossroads he found\r\nthe Confederate trains and artillery moving rapidly westward.  Having\r\ndriven away the escort, Davies succeeded in burning nearly two\r\nhundred wagons, and brought off five pieces of artillery.  Among\r\nthese wagons were some belonging to General, Lee's and to General\r\nFitzhugh Lee's headquarters.  This work through, Davies withdrew and\r\nrejoined Crook, who, with Smith and Gregg, was established near Flat\r\nCreek.\r\n\r\nIt being plain that Lee would attempt to escape as soon as his trains\r\nwere out of the way, I was most anxious to attack him when the Second\r\nCorps began to arrive, for I felt certain that unless we did so he\r\nwould succeed in passing by our left flank, and would thus again make\r\nour pursuit a stern-chase; but General Meade, whose plan of attack\r\nwas to advance his right flank on Amelia Court House, objected to\r\nassailing before all his troops were up.\r\n\r\nI then sent despatches to General Grant, explaining what Davies had\r\ndone, and telling him that the Second Corps was arriving, and that I\r\nwished he himself was present.  I assured him of my confidence in our\r\ncapturing Lee if we properly exerted ourselves, and informed him,\r\nfinally, that I would put all my cavalry, except Mackenzie, on my\r\nleft, and that, with such a disposition of my forces, I could see no\r\nescape for Lee.  I also inclosed him this letter, which had just been\r\ncaptured:\r\n\r\n\"AMELIA C. H., April 5, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR MAMMA:\r\n\r\n\"Our army is ruined, I fear.  We are all safe as yet.  Shyron left us\r\nsick.  John Taylor is well--saw him yesterday.  We are in line of\r\nbattle this morning.  General Robert Lee is in the field near us.  My\r\ntrust is still in the justice of our cause, and that of God.  General\r\nHill is killed.  I saw Murray a few minutes since.  Bernard, Terry\r\nsaid, was taken prisoner, but may yet get out.  I send this by a\r\nnegro I see passing up the railroad to Mechlenburg.  Love to all.\r\n\r\n\"Your devoted son,\r\n\r\n\"Wm. B. TAYLOR, Colonel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Grant, who on the 5th was accompanying General Ord's column\r\ntoward Burkeville Junction, did not receive this intelligence till\r\nnearly nightfall, when within about ten miles of the Junction.  He\r\nset out for Jettersville immediately, but did not reach us till near\r\nmidnight, too late of course to do anything that night.  Taking me\r\nwith him, we went over to see Meade, whom he then directed to advance\r\nearly in the morning on Amelia Court House.  In this interview Grant\r\nalso stated that the orders Meade had already issued would permit\r\nLee's escape, and therefore must be changed, for it was not the aim\r\nonly to follow the enemy, but to get ahead of him, remarking during\r\nthe conversation that, \"he had no doubt Lee was moving right then.\"\r\nOn this same occasion Meade expressed a desire to have in the\r\nproposed attack all the troops of the Army of the Potomac under his\r\nown command, and asked for the return of the Fifth Corps.  I made no\r\nobjections, and it was ordered to report, to him.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the morning of the 6th, Meade advanced toward Amelia Court\r\nHouse, he found, as predicted, that Lee was gone.  It turned out that\r\nthe retreat began the evening of the 5th and continued all night.\r\nSatisfied that this would be the case, I did not permit the cavalry\r\nto participate in Meade's useless advance, but shifted it out toward\r\nthe left to the road running from Deatonsville to Rice's station,\r\nCrook leading and Merritt close up.  Before long the enemy's trains\r\nwere discovered on this road, but Crook could make but little\r\nimpression on them, they were so strongly guarded; so, leaving\r\nStagg's brigade and Miller's battery about three miles southwest of\r\nDeatonsville--where the road forks, with a branch leading north\r\ntoward the Appomattox--to harass the retreating column and find a\r\nvulnerable point, I again shifted the rest of the cavalry toward the\r\nleft, across-country, but still keeping parallel to the enemy's line\r\nof march.\r\n\r\nJust after crossing Sailor's Greek, a favorable opportunity offering,\r\nboth Merritt and Crook attacked vigorously, gained the Rice's Station\r\nroad, destroyed several hundred wagons, made many prisoners, and\r\ncaptured sixteen pieces of artillery.  This was important, but more\r\nvaluable still was the fact that we were astride the enemy's line of\r\nretreat, and had cut off from joining Longstreet, waiting at Rice's\r\nStation, a corps of Confederate infantry under General Ewell,\r\ncomposed of Anderson's, Kershaw's, and Custis Lee's divisions.\r\nStagg's brigade and Miller's battery, which, as I have said, had been\r\nleft at the forks of the Deatonsville road, had meanwhile broken in\r\nbetween the rear of Ewell's column and the head of Gordon's, forcing\r\nGordon to abandon his march for Rice's Station, and to take the\r\nright-hand road at the forks, on which he was pursued by General\r\nHumphreys.\r\n\r\nThe complete isolation of Ewell from Longstreet in his front and\r\nGordon in his rear led to the battle of Sailor's Creek, one of the\r\nseverest conflicts of the war, for the enemy fought with desperation\r\nto escape capture, and we, bent on his destruction, were no less\r\neager and determined.  The capture of Ewell, with six of his generals\r\nand most of his troops, crowned our success, but the fight was so\r\novershadowed by the stirring events of the surrender three days\r\nlater, that the battle has never been accorded the prominence it\r\ndeserves.\r\n\r\nThe small creek from which the field takes its name flows in a\r\nnorthwesterly direction across the road leading from Deatonsville to\r\nRice's Station.  By shifting to the left, Merritt gained the Rice's\r\nStation road west of the creek, making havoc of the wagon-trains,\r\nwhile Crook struck them further on and planted himself square across\r\nthe road.  This blocked Ewell, who, advancing Anderson to some high\r\nground west of the creek, posted him behind barricades, with the\r\nintention of making a hard fight there, while the main body should\r\nescape through the woods in a westerly direction to roads that led to\r\nFarmville.  This was prevented, however, by Crook forming his\r\ndivision, two brigades dismounted and one mounted, and at once\r\nassaulting all along Anderson's front and overlapping his right,\r\nwhile Merritt fiercely attacked to the right of Crook.  The enemy\r\nbeing thus held, enabled the Sixth Corps--which in the meantime I had\r\nsent for--to come upon the ground, and Ewell, still contending with\r\nthe cavalry, found himself suddenly beset by this new danger from his\r\nrear.  To, meet it, he placed Kershaw to the right and Custis Lee to\r\nthe left of the Rice's Station road, facing them north toward and\r\nsome little distance from Sailor's Creek, supporting Kershaw with\r\nCommander Tucker's Marine brigade.  Ewell's skirmishers held the line\r\nof Sailor's Creek, which runs through a gentle valley, the north\r\nslope of which was cleared ground.\r\n\r\nBy General Grant's directions the Sixth Corps had been following my\r\nroute of march since the discovery, about 9 o'clock in the morning,\r\nthat Lee had decamped from Amelia Court House.  Grant had promptly\r\ninformed me of this in a note, saying, \"The Sixth Corps will go in\r\nwith a vim any place you may dictate,\" so when I sent word to Wright\r\nof the enemy's isolation, and asked him to hurry on with all speed,\r\nhis gallant corps came as fast as legs could carry them, he sending\r\nto me successively Major McClellan and Colonel Franklin, of his\r\nstaff, to report his approach.\r\n\r\nI was well advised as to the position of the enemy through\r\ninformation brought me by an intelligent young soldier, William A.\r\nRichardson, Company \"A,\" Second Ohio, who, in one of the cavalry\r\ncharges on Anderson, had cleared the barricades and made his way back\r\nto my front through Ewell's line.  Richardson had told me just how\r\nthe main body of the enemy was posted, so as Seymour's division\r\narrived I directed General Wright to put it on the right of the road,\r\nwhile Wheaton's men, coming up all hot and out of breath, promptly\r\nformed on Seymour's left.  Both divisions thus aligned faced\r\nsouthwest toward Sailor's Creek, and the artillery of the corps being\r\nmassed to the left and front of the Hibbon house, without waiting for\r\nGetty's division--for I feared that if we delayed longer the enemy\r\nmight effect his escape toward Farmville--the general attack was\r\nbegun.  Seymour and Wheaton, moving forward together, assailed the\r\nenemy's front and left, and Stagg's brigade, too, which in the mean\r\ntime had been placed between Wheaton's left and Devin's right, went\r\nat him along with them, Merritt and Crook resuming the fight from\r\ntheir positions in front of Anderson.  The enemy, seeing little\r\nchance of escape, fought like a tiger at bay, but both Seymour and\r\nWheaton pressed him vigorously, gaining ground at all points except\r\njust to the right of the road, where Seymour's left was checked.\r\nHere the Confederates burst back on us in a counter-charge, surging\r\ndown almost to the creek, but the artillery, supported by Getty, who\r\nin the mean time had come on the ground, opened on them so terribly\r\nthat this audacious and furious onset was completely broken, though\r\nthe gallant fellows fell back to their original line doggedly, and\r\nnot until after they had almost gained the creek.  Ewell was now\r\nhemmed in on every side, and all those under his immediate command\r\nwere captured.  Merritt and Crook had also broken up Anderson by this\r\ntime, but he himself, and about two thousand disorganized men escaped\r\nby making their way through the woods toward the Appomattox River\r\nbefore they could be entirely enveloped.  Night had fallen when the\r\nfight was entirely over, but Devin was pushed on in pursuit for about\r\ntwo miles, part of the Sixth Corps following to clinch a victory\r\nwhich not only led to the annihilation of one corps of Lee's\r\nretreating army, but obliged Longstreet to move up to Farmville, so\r\nas to take a road north of the Appomattox River toward Lynchburg\r\ninstead of continuing toward Danville.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the battle I sent one of my staff--Colonel Redwood\r\nPrice--to General Grant to report what had been done; that we had\r\ntaken six generals and from nine to ten thousand prisoners.  On his\r\nway Price stopped at the headquarters of General Meade, where he\r\nlearned that not the slightest intelligence of the occurrence on my\r\nline had been received, for I not being under Meade's command, he had\r\npaid no attention to my movements.  Price gave the story of the\r\nbattle, and General Meade, realizing its importance, sent directions\r\nimmediately to General Wright to make his report of the engagement to\r\nthe headquarters of the Army of the Potomac, assuming that Wright was\r\noperating independently of me in the face of Grant's despatch Of\r\n2 o'clock, which said that Wright was following the cavalry and would\r\n\"go in with a vim\" wherever I dictated.  Wright could not do else\r\nthan comply with Meade's orders in the case, and I, being then in\r\nignorance of Meade's reasons for the assumption, could say nothing.\r\nBut General Grant plainly intending, and even directing, that the\r\ncorps should be under my command, remedied this phase of the matter,\r\nwhen informed of what had taken place, by requiring Wright to send a\r\nreport of the battle through me.  What he then did, and what his\r\nintentions and orders were, are further confirmed by a reference to\r\nthe episode in his \"Memoirs,\" where he gives his reasons for ordering\r\nthe Sixth Corps to abandon the move on Amelia Court House and pass to\r\nthe left of the army.  On the same page he also says, referring to\r\nthe 6th of April: \"The Sixth Corps now remained with the cavalry\r\nunder Sheridan's direct command until after the surrender.\"  He\r\nunquestionably intended all of this, but his purpose was partly\r\nfrustrated by General Meade's action next morning in assuming\r\ndirection of the movements of the corps; and before General Grant\r\nbecame aware of the actual conditions the surrender was at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nLINCOLN'S LACONIC DESPATCH--CAPTURING LEE'S SUPPLIES--DELIGHTED\r\nENGINEERS--THE CONFEDERATES' LAST EFFORT--A FLAG OF TRUCE--GENERAL\r\nGEARY'S \"LAST DITCH\" ABSURDITY--MEETING OF GRANT AND LEE--THE\r\nSURRENDER--ESTIMATE OF GENERAL GRANT.\r\n\r\nThe first report of the battle of Sailor's Creek that General Grant\r\nreceived was, as already stated, an oral message carried by Colonel\r\nPrice, of my staff.  Near midnight I sent a despatch giving the names\r\nof the generals captured.  These were Ewell, Kershaw, Barton, Corse,\r\nDubose, and Custis Lee.  In the same despatch I wrote: \"If the thing\r\nis pressed, I think that Lee will surrender.\"  When Mr. Lincoln, at\r\nCity Point, received this word from General Grant, who was\r\ntransmitting every item of news to the President, he telegraphed\r\nGrant the laconic message: \"Let the thing be pressed.\" The morning of\r\nthe 7th we moved out at a very early hour, Crook's division marching\r\ntoward Farmville in direct pursuit, while Merritt and Mackenzie were\r\nordered to Prince Edward's Court House to anticipate any effort Lee\r\nmight make to escape through that place toward Danville since it had\r\nbeen discovered that Longstreet had slipped away already from the\r\nfront of General Ord's troops at Rice's Station.  Crook overtook the\r\nmain body of the Confederates at Farmville, and promptly attacked\r\ntheir trains on the north side of the Appomattox with Gregg's\r\nbrigade, which was fiercely turned upon and forced to re-cross the\r\nriver with the loss of a number of prisoner's, among them Gregg\r\nhimself.  When Crook sent word of this fight, it was clear that Lee\r\nhad abandoned all effort to escape to the southwest by way of\r\nDanville.  Lynchburg was undoubtedly his objective point now; so,\r\nresolving to throw my cavalry again across his path, and hold him\r\ntill the infantry could overtake him, I directed everything on\r\nAppomattox depot, recalling Crook the night of the 7th to Prospect\r\nStation, while Merritt camped at Buffalo Creek, and Mackenzie made a\r\nreconnoissance along the Lynchburg railroad.\r\n\r\nAt break of day, April 8, Merritt and Mackenzie united with Crook at\r\nProspect Station, and the cavalry all moved then toward Appomattox\r\ndepot.  Hardly had it started when one of the scouts--Sergeant White\r\n--informed me that there were four trains of cars at the depot loaded\r\nwith supplies for Lee's army; these had been sent from Lynchburg, in\r\ncompliance with the telegram of Lee's commissary-general, which\r\nmessage, it will be remembered, was captured and transmitted to\r\nLynchburg by two of Young's scouts on the 4th.  Sergeant White, who\r\nhad been on the lookout for the trains ever since sending the\r\ndespatch, found them several miles west of Appomattox depot feeling\r\ntheir way along, in ignorance of Lee's exact position.  As he had the\r\noriginal despatch with him, and took pains to dwell upon the pitiable\r\ncondition of Lee's army, he had little difficulty in persuading the\r\nmen in charge of the trains to bring them east of Appomattox Station,\r\nbut fearing that the true state of affairs would be learned before\r\nlong, and the trains be returned to Lynchburg, he was painfully\r\nanxious to have them cut off by breaking the track west of the\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence as to the trains was immediately despatched to\r\nCrook, and I pushed on to join him with Merritt's command.  Custer\r\nhaving the advance, moved rapidly, and on nearing the station\r\ndetailed two regiments to make a detour southward to strike the\r\nrailroad some distance beyond and break the track.  These regiments\r\nset off at a gallop, and in short order broke up the railroad enough\r\nto prevent the escape of the trains, Custer meanwhile taking\r\npossession of the station, but none too soon, for almost at the\r\nmoment he did so the advance-guard of Lee's army appeared, bent on\r\nsecuring the trains.  Without halting to look after the cars further,\r\nCuster attacked this advance-guard and had a spirited fight, in which\r\nhe drove the Confederates away from the station, captured twenty-five\r\npieces of artillery, a hospital train, and a large park of wagons,\r\nwhich, in the hope that they would reach Lynchburg next day, were\r\nbeing pushed ahead of Lee's main body.\r\n\r\nDevin coming up a little before dusk, was put in on the right of\r\nCuster, and one of Crook's brigades was sent to our left and the\r\nother two held in reserve.  I then forced the enemy back on the\r\nAppomattox road to the vicinity of the Court House, and that the\r\nConfederates might have no rest, gave orders to continue the\r\nskirmishing throughout the night.  Meanwhile the captured trains had\r\nbeen taken charge of by locomotive engineers, soldiers of the\r\ncommand, who were delighted evidently to get back at their old\r\ncalling.  They amused themselves by running the trains to and fro,\r\ncreating much confusion, and keeping up such an unearthly screeching\r\nwith the whistles that I was on the point of ordering the cars\r\nburned.  They finally wearied of their fun, however, and ran the\r\ntrains off to the east toward General Ord's column.\r\n\r\nThe night of the 8th I made my headquarters at a little frame house\r\njust south of the station.  I did not sleep at all, nor did anybody\r\nelse, the entire command being up all night long; indeed, there had\r\nbeen little rest in the cavalry for the past eight days.  The\r\nnecessity of getting Ord's column up was so obvious now that\r\nstaff-officer after staff-officer was sent to him and to General Grant\r\nrequesting that the infantry be pushed on, for if it could get to the\r\nfront, all knew that the rebellion would be ended on the morrow.\r\nMerritt, Crook, Custer, and Devin were present at frequent intervals\r\nduring the night, and everybody was overjoyed at the prospect that\r\nour weary work was about to end so happily.  Before sun-up General\r\nOrd arrived, and informed me of the approach of his column, it having\r\nbeen marching the whole night.  As he ranked me, of course I could\r\ngive him no orders, so after a hasty consultation as to where his\r\ntroops should be placed we separated, I riding to the front to\r\noverlook my line near Appomattox Court House, while he went back to\r\nurge along his weary troops.\r\n\r\nThe night before General Lee had held a council with his principal\r\ngenerals, when it was arranged that in the morning General Gordon\r\nshould undertake to break through my cavalry, and when I neared my\r\ntroops this movement was beginning, a heavy line of infantry bearing\r\ndown on us from the direction of the village.  In front of Crook and\r\nMackenzie firing had already begun, so riding to a slight elevation\r\nwhere a good view of the Confederates could be had, I there came to\r\nthe conclusion that it would be unwise to offer more resistance than\r\nthat necessary to give Ord time to form, so I directed Merritt to\r\nfall back, and in retiring to shift Devin and Custer to the right so\r\nas to make room for Ord, now in the woods to my rear.  Crook, who\r\nwith his own and Mackenzie's divisions was on my extreme left\r\ncovering some by-roads, was ordered to hold his ground as long as\r\npracticable without sacrificing his men, and, if forced to retire, to\r\ncontest with obstinacy the enemy's advance.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, I could not direct General Ord's course, he being\r\nmy senior, but hastily galloping back to where he was, at the edge of\r\nthe timber, I explained to him what was taking place at the front.\r\nMerritt's withdrawal inspired the Confederates, who forthwith began\r\nto press Crook, their line of battle advancing with confidence till\r\nit reached the crest whence I had reconnoitred them.  From this\r\nground they could see Ord's men emerging from the woods, and the\r\nhopelessness of a further attack being plain, the gray lines\r\ninstinctively halted, and then began to retire toward a ridge\r\nimmediately fronting Appomattox Court House, while Ord, joined on his\r\nright by the Fifth Corps, advanced on them over the ground that\r\nMerritt had abandoned.\r\n\r\nI now directed my steps toward Merritt, who, having mounted his\r\ntroopers, had moved them off to the right, and by the time I reached\r\nhis headquarters flag he was ready for work, so a move on the enemy's\r\nleft was ordered, and every guidon was bent to the front.  As the\r\ncavalry marched along parallel with the Confederate line, and in\r\ntoward its left, a heavy fire of artillery opened on us, but this\r\ncould not check us at such a time, and we soon reached some high\r\nground about half a mile from the Court House, and from here I could\r\nsee in the low valley beyond the village the bivouac undoubtedly of\r\nLee's army.  The troops did not seem to be disposed in battle order,\r\nbut on the other side of the bivouac was a line of battle--a heavy\r\nrear-guard--confronting, presumably, General Meade.\r\n\r\nI decided to attack at once, and formations were ordered at a trot\r\nfor a charge by Custer's and Devin's divisions down the slope leading\r\nto the camps.  Custer was soon ready, but Devin's division being in\r\nrear its formation took longer, since he had to shift further to the\r\nright; Devin's preparations were, therefore, but partially completed\r\nwhen an aide-decamp galloped up to with the word from Custer, \"Lee\r\nhas surrendered; do not charge; the white flag is up.\"  The enemy\r\nperceiving that Custer was forming for attack, had sent the flag out\r\nto his front and stopped the charge just in time.  I at once sent\r\nword of the truce to General Ord, and hearing nothing more from\r\nCuster himself, I supposed that he had gone down to the Court House\r\nto join a mounted group of Confederates that I could see near there,\r\nso I, too, went toward them, galloping down a narrow ridge, staff and\r\norderlies following; but we had not got half way to the Court House\r\nwhen, from a skirt of timber to our right, not more than three\r\nhundred yards distant, a musketry fire was opened on us.  This halted\r\nus, when, waving my hat, I called out to the firing party that we\r\nwere under a truce, and they were violating it.  This did not stop\r\nthem, however, so we hastily took shelter in a ravine so situated as\r\nto throw a ridge between us and the danger.\r\n\r\nWe traveled in safety down this depression to its mouth, and thence\r\nby a gentle ascent approached the Court House.  I was in advance,\r\nfollowed by a sergeant carrying my battleflag.  When I got within\r\nabout a hundred and fifty yards of the enemy's line, which was\r\nimmediately in front of the Court House, some of the Confederates\r\nleveled their pieces at us, and I again halted.  Their officers kept\r\ntheir men from firing, however, but meanwhile a single-handed contest\r\nhad begun behind me, for on looking back I heard a Confederate\r\nsoldier demanding my battle-flag from the color-bearer, thinking, no\r\ndoubt, that we were coming in as prisoners.  The sergeant had drawn\r\nhis sabre and was about to cut the man down, but at a word from me he\r\ndesisted and carried the flag back to my staff, his assailant quickly\r\nrealizing that the boot was on the other leg.\r\n\r\nThese incidents determined me to remain where I was till the return\r\nof a staff-officer whom I had sent over to demand an explanation from\r\nthe group of Confederates for which I had been heading.  He came back\r\nin a few minutes with apologies for what had occurred, and informed\r\nme that General Gordon and General Wilcox were the superior officers\r\nin the group.  As they wished me to join them I rode up with my\r\nstaff, but we had hardly met when in front of Merritt firing began.\r\nAt the sound I turned to General Gordon, who seemed embarrassed by\r\nthe occurrence, and remarked: \"General, your men fired on me as I was\r\ncoming over here, and undoubtedly they are treating Merritt and\r\nCuster the same way.  We might as well let them fight it out.\"  He\r\nreplied, \"There must be some mistake.\"  I then asked, \"Why not send a\r\nstaff-officer and have your people cease firing; they are violating\r\nthe flag.\" He answered, \"I have no staff-officer to send.\"  Whereupon\r\nI said that I would let him have one of mine, and calling for\r\nLieutenant Vanderbilt Allen, I directed him to carry General Gordon's\r\norders to General Geary, commanding a small brigade of South Carolina\r\ncavalry, to discontinue firing.  Allen dashed off with the message\r\nand soon delivered it, but was made a prisoner, Geary saying, \"I do\r\nnot care for white flags: South Carolinians never surrender....\"  By\r\nthis time Merritt's patience being exhausted, he ordered an attack,\r\nand this in short order put an end to General Geary's \"last ditch\"\r\nabsurdity, and extricated Allen from his predicament.\r\n\r\nWhen quiet was restored Gordon remarked: \"General Lee asks for a\r\nsuspension of hostilities pending the negotiations which he is having\r\nwith General Grant.\"  I rejoined: \"I have been constantly informed of\r\nthe progress of the negotiations, and think it singular that while\r\nsuch discussions are going on, General Lee should have continued his\r\nmarch and attempted to break through my lines this morning.  I will\r\nentertain no terms except that General Lee shall surrender to General\r\nGrant on his arrival here.  If these terms are not accepted we will\r\nrenew hostilities.\"  Gordon replied: \"General Lee's army is\r\nexhausted.  There is no doubt of his surrender to General Grant.\"\r\n\r\nIt was then that General Ord joined us, and after shaking hands all\r\naround, I related the situation to him, and Gordon went away agreeing\r\nto meet us again in half an hour.  When the time was up he came back\r\naccompanied by General Longstreet, who brought with him a despatch,\r\nthe duplicate of one that had been sent General Grant through General\r\nMeade's lines back on the road over which Lee had been retreating.\r\n\r\nGeneral Longstreet renewed the assurances that already had been given\r\nby Gordon, and I sent Colonel Newhall with the despatch to find\r\nGeneral Grant and bring him to the front.  When Newhall started,\r\neverything on our side of the Appomattox Court House was quiet, for\r\ninevitable surrender was at hand, but Longstreet feared that Meade,\r\nin ignorance of the new conditions on my front might attack the\r\nConfederate rearguard.  To prevent this I offered to send Colonel J.\r\nW. Forsyth through the enemy's lines to let Meade know of my\r\nagreement, for he too was suspicious that by a renewed correspondence\r\nLee was endeavoring to gain time for escape.  My offer being\r\naccepted, Forsyth set out accompanied by Colonel Fairfax, of\r\nLongstreet's staff, and had no difficulty in accomplishing his\r\nmission.\r\n\r\nAbout five or six miles from Appomattox, on the road toward Prospect\r\nStation near its intersection with the Walker's Church road, my\r\nadjutant-general, Colonel Newhall, met General Grant, he having\r\nstarted from north of the Appomattox River for my front the morning\r\nof April 9, in consequence of the following despatches which had been\r\nsent him the night before, after we had captured Appomattox Station\r\nand established a line intercepting Lee:\r\n\r\n\"CAVALRY HEADQUARTERS, April 8, 1865--9:20 P. M.\r\n\r\n\"LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT,\r\n\"Commanding Armies of the U.  S.\r\n\r\n\"General: I marched early this morning from Buffalo Creek and\r\nProspect Station on Appomattox Station, where my scouts had reported\r\ntrains of cars with supplies for Lee's army.  A short time before\r\ndark General Custer, who had the advance, made a dash at the station,\r\ncapturing four trains of supplies with locomotives.  One of the\r\ntrains was burned and the others were run back toward Farmville for\r\nsecurity.  Custer then pushed on toward Appomattox Court House,\r\ndriving the enemy--who kept up a heavy fire of artillery--charging\r\nthem repeatedly and capturing, as far as reported, twenty-five pieces\r\nof artillery and a number of prisoners and wagons.  The First Cavalry\r\nDivision supported him on the right.  A reconnoissance sent across\r\nthe Appomattox reports the enemy moving on the Cumberland road to\r\nAppomattox Station, where they expect to get supplies.  Custer is\r\nstill pushing on.  If General Gibbon and the Fifth Corps can get up\r\nto-night, we will perhaps finish the job in the morning.  I do not\r\nthink Lee means to surrender until compelled to do so.\r\n\r\n\"P. H. SHERIDAN, Major-General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY, April 8, 1865--9:40 p.m.\r\n\r\n\"LIEUTENANT-GENERAL U. S. GRANT.\r\n\"Commanding Armies U. S.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL: Since writing the accompanying despatch, General Custer\r\nreports that his command has captured in all thirty-five pieces of\r\nartillery, one thousand prisoners--including one general officer--and\r\nfrom one hundred and fifty to two hundred wagons.\r\n\r\n\"P. H. SHERIDAN, Major-General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn attempting to conduct the lieutenant-general and staff back by a\r\nshort route, Newhall lost his bearings for a time, inclining in\r\ntoward the enemy's lines too far, but regained the proper direction\r\nwithout serious loss of time.  General Grant arrived about 1 o'clock\r\nin the afternoon, Ord and I, dismounted, meeting him at the edge of\r\nthe town, or crossroads, for it was little more.  He remaining\r\nmounted, spoke first to me, saying simply,\r\n\r\n\"How are you, Sheridan?\"  I assured him with thanks that I was\r\n\"first-rate,\" when, pointing toward the village, he asked, \"Is\r\nGeneral Lee up there?\" and I replied: \"There is his army down in that\r\nvalley, and he himself is over in that house (designating McLean's\r\nhouse) waiting to surrender to you.\"  The General then said, \"Come,\r\nlet us go over,\" this last remark being addressed to both Ord and me.\r\nWe two then mounted and joined him, while our staff-officers\r\nfollowed, intermingling with those of the general-in-chief as the\r\ncavalcade took its way to McLean's house near by, and where General\r\nLee had arrived some time before, in consequence of a message from\r\nGeneral Grant consenting to the interview asked for by Lee through\r\nMeade's front that morning--the consent having been carried by\r\nColonel Babcock.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered McLean's house General Lee was standing, as was also\r\nhis military secretary, Colonel Marshall, his only staff-officer\r\npresent.  General Lee was dressed in a new uniform and wore a\r\nhandsome sword.  His tall, commanding form thus set off contrasted\r\nstrongly with the short figure of General Grant, clothed as he was in\r\na soiled suit, without sword or other insignia of his position except\r\na pair of dingy shoulder-straps.  After being presented, Ord and I,\r\nand nearly all of General Grant's staff, withdrew to await the\r\nagreement as to terms, and in a little while Colonel Babcock came to\r\nthe door and said, \"The surrender had been made; you can come in\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we re-entered General Grant was writing; and General Lee, having\r\nin his hand two despatches, which I that morning requested might be\r\nreturned, as I had no copies of them, addressed me with the remark:\r\n\"I am sorry.  It is probable that my cavalry at that point of the\r\nline did not fully understand the agreement.\" These despatches had\r\nbeen sent in the forenoon, after the fighting had been stopped,\r\nnotifying General Lee that some of his cavalry in front of Crook was\r\nviolating the suspension of hostilities by withdrawing.  About\r\n3 o'clock in the afternoon the terms of surrender were written out\r\nand accepted, and General Lee left the house, as he departed\r\ncordially shaking hands with General Grant.  A moment later he\r\nmounted his chunky gray horse, and lifting his hat as he passed out\r\nof the yard, rode off toward his army, his arrival there being\r\nannounced to us by cheering, which, as it progressed, varying in\r\nloudness, told he was riding through the bivouac of the Army of\r\nNorthern Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe surrender of General Lee practically ended the war of the\r\nrebellion.  For four years his army had been the main-stay of the\r\nConfederacy; and the marked ability with which he directed its\r\noperations is evidenced both by his frequent successes and the length\r\nof time he kept up the contest.  Indeed, it may be said that till\r\nGeneral Grant was matched against him, he never met an opponent he\r\ndid not vanquish, for while it is true that defeat was inflicted on\r\nthe Confederates at Antietam and Gettysburg, yet the fruits of these\r\nvictories were not gathered, for after each of these battles Lee was\r\nleft unmolested till he had a chance to recuperate.\r\n\r\nThe assignment of General Grant to the command of the Union armies in\r\nthe winter of 1863-64 gave presage of success from the start, for his\r\neminent abilities had already been proved, and besides, he was a\r\ntower of strength to the Government, because he had the confidence of\r\nthe people.  They knew that henceforth systematic direction would be\r\ngiven to our armies in every section of the vast territory over which\r\nactive operations were being prosecuted, and further, that this\r\ncoherence, this harmony of plan, was the one thing needed to end the\r\nwar, for in the three preceding years there had been illustrated most\r\nlamentable effects of the absence of system.  From the moment he set\r\nour armies in motion simultaneously, in the spring of 1864, it could\r\nbe seen that we should be victorious ultimately, for though on\r\ndifferent lines we were checked now and then, yet we were harassing\r\nthe Confederacy at so many vital points that plainly it must yield to\r\nour blows.  Against Lee's army, the forefront of the Confederacy,\r\nGrant pitted himself; and it may be said that the Confederate\r\ncommander was now, for the first time, overmatched, for against all\r\nhis devices--the products of a mind fertile in defense--General Grant\r\nbrought to bear not only the wealth of expedient which had hitherto\r\ndistinguished him, but also an imperturbable tenacity, particularly\r\nin the Wilderness and on the march to the James, without which the\r\nalmost insurmountable obstacles of that campaign could not have been\r\novercome.  During it and in the siege of Petersburg he met with many\r\ndisappointments--on several occasions the shortcomings of generals,\r\nwhen at the point of success, leading to wretched failures.  But so\r\nfar as he was concerned, the only apparent effect of these\r\ndiscomfitures was to make him all the more determined to discharge\r\nsuccessfully the stupendous trust committed to his care, and to bring\r\ninto play the manifold resources of his well ordered military mind.\r\nHe guided every subordinate then, and in the last days of the\r\nrebellion, with a fund of common sense and superiority of intellect,\r\nwhich have left an impress so distinct as to exhibit his great\r\npersonality.  When his military history is analyzed after the lapse\r\nof years, it will show, even more clearly than now, that during these\r\nas well as in his previous campaigns he was the steadfast Centre\r\nabout and on which everything else turned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nORDERED TO GREENSBORO', N.

At Nottoway\r\nCourt House I heard of the assassination of the President.  The first\r\nnews came to us the night after the dastardly deed, the telegraph\r\noperator having taken it from the wires while in transmission to\r\nGeneral Meade.  The despatch ran that Mr. Lincoln had been, shot at\r\n10 o'clock that morning at Willard's Hotel, but as I could conceive\r\nof nothing to take the President there I set the story down as a\r\ncanard, and went to bed without giving it further thought.  Next\r\nmorning, however, an official telegram confirmed the fact of the\r\nassassination, though eliminating the distorted circumstances that\r\nhad been communicated the night before.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached Petersburg my column was halted, and instructions\r\ngiven me to march the cavalry and the Sixth Corps to Greensboro',\r\nNorth Carolina, for the purpose of aiding General Sherman (the\r\nsurrender of General Johnston having not yet been effected), so I\r\nmade the necessary preparations and moved on the 24th of April,\r\narriving at South Boston, on the Dan River, the 28th, the Sixth Corps\r\nhaving reached Danville meanwhile.  At South Boston I received a\r\ndespatch from General Halleck, who immediately after Lee's surrender\r\nhad been assigned to command at Richmond, informing me that General\r\nJohnston had been brought to terms.  The necessity for going farther\r\nsouth being thus obviated we retraced our steps to Petersburg, from\r\nwhich place I proceeded by steamer to Washington, leaving, the\r\ncavalry to be marched thither by easy stages.\r\n\r\nThe day after my arrival in Washington an important order was sent\r\nme, accompanied by the following letter of instructions, transferring\r\nme to a new field of operations:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\"Washington, D. C., May 17, 1865.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL: Under the orders relieving you from the command of the\r\nMiddle Military Division and assigning you to command west of the\r\nMississippi, you will proceed without delay to the West to arrange\r\nall preliminaries for your new field of duties.\r\n\r\n\"Your duty is to restore Texas, and that part of Louisiana held by\r\nthe enemy, to the Union in the shortest practicable time, in a way\r\nmost effectual for securing permanent peace.\r\n\r\n\"To do this, you will be given all the troops that can be spared\r\nby Major-General Canby, probably twenty-five thousand men of\r\nall arms; the troops with Major-General J. J. Reynolds, in\r\nArkansas, say twelve thousand, Reynolds to command; the Fourth\r\nArmy Corps, now at Nashville, Tennessee, awaiting orders; and\r\nthe Twenty-Fifth Army Corps, now at City Point, Virginia, ready\r\nto embark.\r\n\r\n\"I do not wish to trammel you with instructions; I will state,\r\nhowever, that if Smith holds out, without even an ostensible\r\ngovernment to receive orders from or to report to, he and his men are\r\nnot entitled to the considerations due to an acknowledged\r\nbelligerent.  Theirs are the conditions of outlaws, making war\r\nagainst the only Government having an existence over the territory\r\nwhere war is now being waged.\r\n\r\n\"You may notify the rebel commander west of the Mississippi--holding\r\nintercourse with him in person, or through such officers of the rank\r\nof major-general as you may select--that he will be allowed to\r\nsurrender all his forces on the same terms as were accorded to Lee\r\nand Johnston.  If he accedes, proceed to garrison the Red River as\r\nhigh up as Shreveport, the seaboard at Galveston, Malagorda Bay,\r\nCorpus Christi, and mouth of the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\n\"Place a strong force on the Rio Grande, holding it at least to a\r\npoint opposite Camargo, and above that if supplies can be procured.\r\n\r\n\"In case of an active campaign (a hostile one) I think a heavy force\r\nshould be put on the Rio Grande as a first preliminary.  Troops for\r\nthis might be started at once.  The Twenty-Fifth Corps is now\r\navailable, and to it should be added a force of white troops, say\r\nthose now under Major-General Steele.\r\n\r\n\"To be clear on this last point, I think the Rio Grande should be\r\nstrongly held, whether the forces in Texas surrender or not, and that\r\nno time should be lost in getting troops there.  If war is to be\r\nmade, they will be in the right place; if Kirby Smith surrenders,\r\nthey will be on the line which is to be strongly garrisoned.\r\n\r\n\"Should any force be necessary other than those designated, they can\r\nbe had by calling for them on Army Headquarters.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT,\r\n\"Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\"To MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN,\r\n\"United States Army.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn receipt of these instructions I called at once on General Grant,\r\nto see if they were to be considered so pressing as to preclude my\r\nremaining in Washington till after the Grand Review, which was fixed\r\nfor the 23d and 24th of May, for naturally I had a strong desire to\r\nhead my command on that great occasion.  But the General told me that\r\nit was absolutely necessary to go at once to force the surrender of\r\nthe Confederates under Kirby Smith.  He also told me that the States\r\nlately in rebellion would be embraced in two or three military\r\ndepartments, the commanders of which would control civil affairs\r\nuntil Congress took action about restoring them to the Union, since\r\nthat course would not only be economical and simple, but would give\r\nthe Southern people confidence, and encourage them to go to work,\r\ninstead of distracting them with politics.\r\n\r\nAt this same interview he informed me that there was an additional\r\nmotive in sending me to the new command, a motive not explained by\r\nthe instructions themselves, and went on to say that, as a matter of\r\nfact, he looked upon the invasion of Mexico by Maximilian as a part\r\nof the rebellion itself, because of the encouragement that invasion\r\nhad received from the Confederacy, and that our success in putting\r\ndown secession would never be complete till the French and Austrian\r\ninvaders were compelled to quit the territory of our sister republic.\r\nWith regard to this matter, though, he said it would be necessary for\r\nme to act with great circumspection, since the Secretary of State,\r\nMr. Seward, was much opposed to the use of our troops along the\r\nborder in any active way that would be likely to involve us in a war\r\nwith European powers.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances, my disappointment at not being permitted to\r\nparticipate in the review had to be submitted to, and I left\r\nWashington without an opportunity of seeing again in a body the men\r\nwho, while under my command, had gone through so many trials and\r\nunremittingly pursued and, assailed the enemy, from the beginning of\r\nthe campaign of 1864 till the white flag came into their hands at\r\nAppomattox Court House.\r\n\r\nI went first to St.  Louis, and there took the steamboat for New\r\nOrleans, and when near the mouth of the Red River received word from\r\nGeneral Canby that Kirby Smith had surrendered under terms similar to\r\nthose accorded Lee and Johnston.  But the surrender was not carried\r\nout in good faith, particularly by the Texas troops, though this I\r\ndid not learn till some little time afterward when I was informed\r\nthat they had marched off to the interior of the State in several\r\norganized bodies, carrying with them their camp equipage, arms,\r\nammunition, and even some artillery, with the ultimate purpose of\r\ngoing to Mexico.  In consequence of this, and also because of the\r\ndesire of the Government to make a strong showing of force in Texas,\r\nI decided to traverse the State with two columns of cavalry,\r\ndirecting one to San Antonio under Merritt, the other to Houston\r\nunder Custer.  Both commands were to start from the Red River\r\n--Shreveport and Alexandria--being the respective initial points--and\r\nin organizing the columns, to the mounted force already on the Red\r\nRiver were added several regiments of cavalry from the east bank of\r\nthe Mississippi, and in a singular way one of these fell upon the\r\ntrail of my old antagonist, General Early.  While crossing the river\r\nsomewhere below Vicksburg some of the men noticed a suspicious\r\nlooking party being ferried over in a rowboat, behind which two\r\nhorses were swimming in tow.  Chase was given, and the horses, being\r\nabandoned by the party, fell into the hands of our troopers, who,\r\nhowever, failed to capture or identify the people in the boat.  As\r\nsubsequently ascertained, the men were companions of Early, who was\r\nalready across the Mississippi, hidden in the woods, on his way with\r\ntwo or three of these followers to join the Confederates in Texas,\r\nnot having heard of Kirby Smith's surrender.  A week or two later I\r\nreceived a letter from Early describing the affair, and the capture\r\nof the horses, for which he claimed pay, on the ground that they were\r\nprivate property, because he had taken them in battle.  The letter\r\nalso said that any further pursuit of Early would be useless, as he\r\n\"expected to be on the deep blue sea\" by the time his communication\r\nreached me.  The unfortunate man was fleeing from imaginary dangers,\r\nhowever, for striking his trail was purely accidental, and no effort\r\nwhatever was being made to arrest him personally.  Had this been\r\nespecially desired it might have been accomplished very readily just\r\nafter Lee's surrender, for it was an open secret that Early was then\r\nnot far away, pretty badly disabled with rheumatism.\r\n\r\nBy the time the two columns were ready to set out for San Antonio and\r\nHouston, General Frank Herron,--with one division of the Thirteenth\r\nCorps, occupied Galveston, and another division under General Fred\r\nSteele had gone to Brazos Santiago, to hold Brownsville and the line\r\nof the Rio Grande, the object being to prevent, as far as possible,\r\nthe escaping Confederates from joining Maximilian.  With this purpose\r\nin view, and not forgetting Grant's conviction that the French\r\ninvasion of Mexico was linked with the rebellion, I asked for an\r\nincrease of force to send troops into Texas in fact, to concentrate\r\nat available points in the State an army strong enough to move\r\nagainst the invaders of Mexico if occasion demanded.  The Fourth and\r\nTwenty-fifth army corps being ordered to report to me, accordingly, I\r\nsent the Fourth Corps to Victoria and San Antonio, and the bulk of\r\nthe Twenty-fifth to Brownsville.  Then came the feeding and caring\r\nfor all these troops--a difficult matter--for those at Victoria and\r\nSan Antonio had to be provisioned overland from Indianola across the\r\n\"hog-wallow prairie,\" while the supplies for the forces at\r\nBrownsville and along the Rio Grande must come by way of Brazos\r\nSantiago, from which point I was obliged to construct, with the labor\r\nof the men, a railroad to Clarksville, a distance of about eighteen\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nThe latter part of June I repaired to Brownsville myself to impress\r\nthe Imperialists, as much as possible, with the idea that we intended\r\nhostilities, and took along my chief of scouts--Major Young--and four\r\nof his most trusty men, whom I had had sent from Washington.  From\r\nBrownsville I despatched all these men to important points in\r\nnorthern Mexico, to glean information regarding the movements of the\r\nImperial forces, and also to gather intelligence about the\r\nex-Confederates who had crossed the Rio Grande.  On information\r\nfurnished by these scouts, I caused General Steele to make\r\ndemonstrations all along the lower Rio Grande, and at the same time\r\ndemanded the return of certain munitions of war that had been turned\r\nover by ex-Confederates to the Imperial General (Mejia) commanding at\r\nMatamoras.  These demands, backed up as they were by such a\r\nformidable show of force created much agitation and demoralization\r\namong the Imperial troops, and measures looking to the abandonment of\r\nnorthern Mexico were forthwith adopted by those in authority--a\r\npolicy that would have resulted in the speedy evacuation of the\r\nentire country by Maximilian, had not our Government weakened;\r\ncontenting itself with a few pieces of the contraband artillery\r\nvarnished over with the Imperial apologies.  A golden opportunity was\r\nlost, for we had ample excuse for crossing the boundary, but Mr.\r\nSeward being, as I have already stated, unalterably opposed to any\r\nact likely to involve us in war, insisted on his course of\r\nnegotiation with Napoleon.\r\n\r\nAs the summer wore away, Maximilian, under Mr. Seward's policy,\r\ngained in strength till finally all the accessible sections of Mexico\r\nwere in his possession, and the Republic under President Juarez\r\nalmost succumbed.  Growing impatient at this, in the latter part of\r\nSeptember I decided to try again what virtue there might be in a\r\nhostile demonstration, and selected the upper Rio Grande for the\r\nscene of my attempt.  Merritt's cavalry and the Fourth Corps still\r\nbeing at San Antonio, I went to that place and reviewed these troops,\r\nand having prepared them with some ostentation for a campaign, of\r\ncourse it was bruited about that we were going to invade Mexico.\r\nThen, escorted by a regiment of horse I proceeded hastily to Fort\r\nDuncan, on the Rio Grande just opposite the Mexican town of Piedras\r\nNegras.  Here I opened communication with President Juarez, through\r\none of his staff, taking care not to do this in the dark, and the\r\nnews, spreading like wildfire, the greatest significance was ascribed\r\nto my action, it being reported most positively and with many\r\nspecific details that I was only awaiting the arrival of the troops,\r\nthen under marching orders at San Antonio, to cross the Rio Grande in\r\nbehalf of the Liberal cause.\r\n\r\nAmple corroboration of the reports then circulated was found in my\r\ninquiries regarding the quantity of forage we could depend upon\r\ngetting in Mexico, our arrangements for its purchase, and my sending\r\na pontoon train to Brownsville, together with which was cited the\r\nrenewed activity of the troops along the lower Rio Grande.  These\r\nreports and demonstrations resulted in alarming the Imperialists so\r\nmuch that they withdrew the French and Austrian soldiers from\r\nMatamoras, and practically abandoned the whole of northern Mexico as\r\nfar down as Monterey, with the exception of Matamoras, where General\r\nMejia continued to hang on with a garrison of renegade Mexicans.\r\n\r\nThe abandonment of so much territory in northern Mexico encouraged\r\nGeneral Escobedo and other Liberal leaders to such a degree that they\r\ncollected a considerable army of their followers at Comargo, Mier,\r\nand other points.  At the same time that unknown quantity, Cortinas,\r\nsuspended his free-booting for the nonce, and stoutly harassing\r\nMatamoras, succeeded in keeping its Imperial garrison within the\r\nfortifications.  Thus countenanced and stimulated, and largely\r\nsupplied with arms and ammunition, which we left at convenient places\r\non our side of the river to fall into their hands, the Liberals,\r\nunder General Escobedo--a man of much force of character--were\r\nenabled in northern Mexico to place the affairs of the Republic on a\r\nsubstantial basis.\r\n\r\nBut in the midst of what bade fair to cause a final withdrawal of the\r\nforeigners, we were again checked by our Government, as a result of\r\nrepresentations of the French Minister at Washington.  In October, he\r\nwrote to Mr. Seward that the United States troops on the Rio Grande\r\nwere acting \"in exact opposition to the repeated assurances Your\r\nExcellency has given me concerning the desire of the Cabinet at\r\nWashington to preserve the most strict neutrality in the events now\r\ntaking place in Mexico,\" and followed this statement with an emphatic\r\nprotest against our course.  Without any investigation whatever by\r\nour State Department, this letter of the French Minister was\r\ntransmitted to me, accompanied by directions to preserve a strict\r\nneutrality; so, of course, we were again debarred from anything like\r\nactive sympathy.\r\n\r\nAfter this, it required the patience of Job to abide the slow and\r\npoky methods of our State Department, and, in truth, it was often\r\nvery difficult to restrain officers and men from crossing the Rio\r\nGrande with hostile purpose.  Within the knowledge of my troops,\r\nthere had gone on formerly the transfer of organized bodies of\r\nex-Confederates to Mexico, in aid of the Imperialists, and at this\r\nperiod it was known that there was in preparation an immigration\r\nscheme having in view the colonizing, at Cordova and one or two other\r\nplaces, of all the discontented elements of the defunct Confederacy\r\n--Generals Price, Magruder, Maury, and other high personages being\r\npromoters of the enterprise, which Maximilian took to readily.  He\r\nsaw in it the possibilities of a staunch support to his throne, and\r\ntherefore not only sanctioned the project, but encouraged it with\r\nlarge grants of land, inspirited the promoters with titles of\r\nnobility, and, in addition, instituted a system of peonage, expecting\r\nthat the silver hook thus baited would be largely swallowed by the\r\nSouthern people.\r\n\r\nThe announcement of the scheme was followed by the appointment of\r\ncommissioners in each of the Southern States to send out emigrants;\r\nbut before any were deluded into starting, I made to General Grant a\r\nreport of what was going on, with the recommendation that measures be\r\ntaken, through our State Department, looking to the suppression of\r\nthe colony; but, as usual, nothing could be effected through that\r\nchannel; so, as an alternative, I published, in April, 1866, by\r\nauthority of General Grant, an order prohibiting the embarkation from\r\nports in Louisiana and Texas, for ports in Mexico, of any person\r\nwithout a permit from my headquarters.  This dampened the ardor of\r\neverybody in the Gulf States who had planned to go to Mexico; and\r\nalthough the projectors of the Cordova Colonization Scheme--the name\r\nby which it was known--secured a few innocents from other districts,\r\nyet this set-back led ultimately to failure.\r\n\r\nAmong the Liberal leaders along the Rio Grande during this period\r\nthere sprang up many factional differences from various causes, some\r\npersonal, others political, and some, I regret to say, from downright\r\nmoral obliquity--as, for example, those between Cortinas and Canales\r\n--who, though generally hostile to the Imperialists, were freebooters\r\nenough to take a shy at each other frequently, and now and then even\r\nto join forces against Escobedo, unless we prevented them by coaxing\r\nor threats.  A general who could unite these several factions was\r\ntherefore greatly needed, and on my return to New Orleans I so\r\ntelegraphed General Grant, and he, thinking General Caravajal (then\r\nin Washington seeking aid for the Republic) would answer the purpose,\r\npersuaded him to report to me in New Orleans.  Caravajal promptly\r\nappeared, but he did not impress me very favorably.  He was old and\r\ncranky, yet, as he seemed anxious to do his best, I sent him over to\r\nBrownsville, with credentials, authorizing him to cross into Mexico,\r\nand followed him myself by the next boat.  When I arrived in\r\nBrownsville, matters in Matamoras had already reached a crisis.\r\nGeneral Mejia, feeling keenly the moral support we were giving the\r\nLiberals, and hard pressed by the harassing attacks of Cortinas and\r\nCanales, had abandoned the place, and Caravajal, because of\r\nhis credentials from our side, was in command, much to the\r\ndissatisfaction of both those chiefs whose differences it was\r\nintended he should reconcile.\r\n\r\nThe day after I got to Brownsville I visited Matamoras, and had a\r\nlong interview with Caravajal.  The outcome of this meeting was, on\r\nmy part, a stronger conviction than ever that he was unsuitable, and\r\nI feared that either Canales or Cortinas would get possession of the\r\ncity.  Caravajal made too many professions of what he would do--in\r\nshort, bragged too much--but as there was no help for the situation,\r\nI made the best of it by trying to smooth down the ruffled feathers\r\nof Canales and Cortinas.  In my interview with Caravajal I\r\nrecommended Major Young as a confidential man, whom he could rely\r\nupon as a \"go-between\" for communicating with our people at\r\nBrownsville, and whom he could trust to keep him informed of the\r\naffairs of his own country as well.\r\n\r\nA day or two afterward I recrossed the Gulf to New Orleans, and then,\r\nbeing called from my headquarters to the interior of Texas, a\r\nfortnight passed before I heard anything from Brownsville.  In the\r\nmeanwhile Major Young had come to New Orleans, and organized there a\r\nband of men to act as a body-guard for Caravajal, the old wretch\r\nhaving induced him to accept the proposition by representing that it\r\nhad my concurrence.  I at once condemned the whole business, but\r\nYoung, having been furnished with seven thousand dollars to recruit\r\nthe men and buy their arms, had already secured both, and was so\r\ndeeply involved in the transaction, he said, that he could not\r\nwithdraw without dishonor, and with tears in his eyes he besought me\r\nto help him.  He told me he had entered upon the adventure in the\r\nfirm belief that I would countenance it; that the men and their\r\nequipment were on his hands; that he must make good his word at all\r\nhazards; and that while I need not approve, yet I must go far enough\r\nto consent to the departure of the men, and to loan him the money\r\nnecessary to provision his party and hire a schooner to carry them to\r\nBrazos.  It was hard in deed to resist the appeals of this man, who\r\nhad served me so long and so well, and the result of his pleading was\r\nthat I gave him permission to sail, and also loaned him the sum asked\r\nfor; but I have never ceased to regret my consent, for misfortune\r\nfell upon the enterprise almost from its inception.\r\n\r\nBy the time the party got across the Gulf and over to Brownsville,\r\nCaravajal had been deposed by Canales, and the latter would not\r\naccept their services.  This left Young with about fifty men to whom\r\nhe was accountable, and as he had no money to procure them\r\nsubsistence, they were in a bad fix.  The only thing left to do was\r\nto tender their services to General Escobedo, and with this in view\r\nthe party set out to reach the General's camp, marching up the Rio\r\nGrande on the American side, intending to cross near Ringgold Bar\r\nracks.  In advance of them, however, had spread far and wide the\r\ntidings of who they were, what they proposed to do, and where they\r\nwere going, and before they could cross into Mexico they were\r\nattacked by a party of ex-Confederates and  renegade Mexican\r\nrancheros.  Being on American soil, Young forbade his men to return\r\nthe fire, and bent all his efforts to getting them over the river;\r\nbut in this attempt they were broken up, and became completely\r\ndemoralized.  A number of the men were drowned while swimming the\r\nriver, Young himself was shot and killed, a few were captured, and\r\nthose who escaped--about twenty in all--finally joined Escobedo, but\r\nin such a  plight as to be of little use.  With this distressing\r\naffair came to an end pretty much all open participation of American\r\nsympathizers with the Liberal cause, but the moral support afforded\r\nby the presence of our forces continued, and this was frequently\r\nsupplemented with material aid in the shape of munitions of war,\r\nwhich we liberally supplied, though constrained to do so by the most\r\nsecret methods.\r\n\r\nThe term of office of Juarez as President of the Mexican Republic\r\nexpired in December, 1865, but to meet existing exigencies he had\r\ncontinued himself in office by proclamation, a course rendered\r\nnecessary by the fact that no elections could be held on account of\r\nthe Imperial occupation of most of the country.  The official who, by\r\nthe Mexican Constitution, is designated for the succession in such an\r\nemergency, is the President of the Supreme Court, and the person then\r\neligible under this provision was General Ortega, but in the interest\r\nof the Imperialists he had absented himself from Mexico, hence the\r\npatriotic course of Juarez in continuing himself at the head of\r\naffairs was a necessity of the situation.  This action of the\r\nPresident gave the Imperialists little concern at first, but with the\r\nrevival of the Liberal cause they availed themselves of every means\r\nto divide its supporters, and Ortega, who had been lying low in the\r\nUnited States, now came forward to claim the Presidency.  Though\r\nridiculously late for such a step, his first act was to issue a\r\nmanifesto protesting against the assumption of the executive\r\nauthority by Juarez.  The protest had little effect, however, and his\r\nnext proceeding was to come to New Orleans, get into correspondence\r\nwith other disaffected Mexicans, and thus perfect his plans.  When he\r\nthought his intrigue ripe enough for action, he sailed for Brazos,\r\nintending to cross the Rio Grande and assert his claims with arms.\r\nWhile he was scheming in New Orleans, however, I had learned what he\r\nwas up to, and in advance of his departure had sent instructions to\r\nhave him arrested on American soil.  Colonel Sedgwick, commanding at\r\nBrownsville, was now temporary master of Matamoras also, by reason of\r\nhaving stationed some American troops there for the protection of\r\nneutral merchants, so when Ortega appeared at Brazos, Sedgwick\r\nquietly arrested him and held him till the city of Matamoras was\r\nturned over to General Escobedo, the authorized representative of\r\nJuarez; then Escobedo took charge, of Ortega, and with ease prevented\r\nhis further machinations.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter and spring of 1866 we continued covertly supplying\r\narms and ammunition to the Liberals--sending as many as 30,000\r\nmuskets from Baton Rouge Arsenal alone--and by mid-summer Juarez,\r\nhaving organized a pretty good sized army, was in possession of the\r\nwhole line of the Rio Grande, and, in fact, of nearly the whole of\r\nMexico down to San Louis Potosi.  Then thick and fast came rumors\r\npointing to the tottering condition of Maximilian's Empire-first,\r\nthat Orizaba and Vera Cruz were being fortified; then, that the\r\nFrench were to be withdrawn; and later came the intelligence that the\r\nEmpress Carlotta had gone home to beg assistance from Napoleon, the\r\nauthor of all of her husband's troubles.  But the situation forced\r\nNapoleon to turn a deaf ear to Carlotta's prayers.  The brokenhearted\r\nwoman besought him on her knees, but his fear of losing an army made\r\nall pleadings vain.  In fact, as I ascertained by the following\r\ncablegram which came into my hands, Napoleon's instructions for the\r\nFrench evacuation were in Mexico at the very time of this pathetic\r\nscene between him and Carlotta.  The despatch was in cipher when I\r\nreceived it, but was translated by the telegraph operator at my\r\nheadquarters, who long before had mastered the key of the French\r\ncipher:\r\n\r\n\"PARIS, January 10, 1867.  FRENCH CONSUL, New Orleans, La.\r\n\r\n\"To GENERAL CASTELNAU, at Mexico.\r\n\r\n\"Received your despatch of the 9th December.  Do not compel the\r\nEmperor to abdicate, but do not delay the departure of the troops;\r\nbring back all those who will not remain there.  Most of the fleet\r\nhas left.\r\n\r\n\"NAPOLEON.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis meant the immediate withdrawal of the French.  The rest of the\r\nstory--which has necessarily been but in outline--is soon told.\r\nMaximilian, though deserted, determined to hold out to the last, and\r\nwith the aid of disloyal Mexicans stuck to his cause till the spring.\r\nWhen taken prisoner at Queretaro, he was tried and executed under\r\ncircumstances that are well known.  From promptings of humanity\r\nSecretary Seward tried hard to save the Imperial prisoner, but\r\nwithout success.  The Secretary's plea for mercy was sent through me\r\nat New Orleans, and to make speed I hired a steamer to proceed with\r\nit across the Gulf to Tampico.  The document was carried by Sergeant\r\nWhite, one of my scouts, who crossed the country from Tampico, and\r\ndelivered it to Escobedo at Queretaro; but Mr. Seward's\r\nrepresentations were without avail--refused probably because little\r\nmercy had been shown certain Liberal leaders unfortunate enough to\r\nfall into Maximilian's hands during the prosperous days of his\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nAt the close of our war there was little hope for the Republic of\r\nMexico.  Indeed, till our troops were concentrated on the Rio Grande\r\nthere was none.  Our appearance in such force along the border\r\npermitted the Liberal leaders, refugees from their homes, to\r\nestablish rendezvous whence they could promulgate their plans in\r\nsafety, while the countenance thus given the cause, when hope was\r\nwell-nigh gone, incited the Mexican people to renewed resistance.\r\nBeginning again with very scant means, for they had lost about all,\r\nthe Liberals saw their cause, under the influence of such significant\r\nand powerful backing, progress and steadily grow so strong that\r\nwithin two years Imperialism had received its death-blow.  I doubt\r\nvery much whether such, results could have been achieved without the\r\npresence of an American army on the Rio Grande, which, be it\r\nremembered, was sent there because, in General Grant's words, the\r\nFrench invasion of Mexico was so closely related to the rebellion as\r\nto be essentially a part of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nA.

At the\r\ntime of Kirby Smith's surrender the National Government had\r\nformulated no plan with regard to these or the other States lately in\r\nrebellion, though a provisional Government had been set up in\r\nLouisiana as early as 1864.  In consequence of this lack of system,\r\nGovernor Pendleton Murray, of Texas, who was elected under\r\nConfederate rule, continued to discharge the duties of Governor till\r\nPresident Johnson, on June 17, in harmony with his amnesty\r\nproclamation of May 29, 1865, appointed A. J. Hamilton provisional\r\nGovernor.  Hamilton was empowered by the President to call a\r\nConstitutional convention, the delegates to which were to be elected,\r\nunder certain prescribed qualifications, for the purpose of\r\norganizing the political affairs of the State, the Governor to be\r\nguided by instructions similar to those given the provisional\r\nGovernor of North Carolina (W. W. Holden), when appointed in May.\r\n\r\nThe convening of this body gave rise to much dissatisfaction among\r\nthe people of Texas.  They had assumed that affairs were to go on as\r\nof old, and that the reintegration of the State was to take place\r\nunder the administration of Governor Murray, who, meanwhile, had\r\ntaken it upon himself, together with the Legislature, to authorize\r\nthe election of delegates to a State Convention, without restriction\r\nas to who should be entitled to vote.  Thus encouraged, the element\r\nbut lately in armed rebellion was now fully bent on restoring the\r\nState to the Union without any intervention whatever of the Federal\r\nGovernment; but the advent of Hamilton put an end to such illusions,\r\nsince his proclamation promptly disfranchised the element in\r\nquestion, whose consequent disappointment and chagrin were so great\r\nas to render this factor of the community almost uncontrollable.  The\r\nprovisional Governor at once rescinded the edict of Governor Murray,\r\nprohibited the assembling of his convention, and shortly after\r\ncalled, one himself, the delegates to which were to b chosen by\r\nvoters who could take the amnesty-oath.  The proclamation convening\r\nthis assemblage also announced the policy that would be pursued in\r\ngoverning the State until its affairs were satisfactorily\r\nreorganized, defined in brief the course to be followed by the\r\nJudiciary, and provided for the appointment, by the Governor, of\r\ncounty officials to succeed those known to be disloyal.  As this\r\naction of Hamilton's disfranchised all who could not take the amnesty\r\noath, and of course deprived them of the offices, it met at once with\r\npronounced and serious opposition, and he quickly realized that he\r\nhad on his hands an arduous task to protect the colored people,\r\nparticularly as in the transition state of society just after the\r\nclose of the war there prevailed much lawlessness, which vented\r\nitself chiefly on the freedmen.  It was greatly feared that political\r\nrights were to be given those so recently in servitude, and as it was\r\ngenerally believed that such enfranchisement would precipitate a race\r\nwar unless the freedmen were overawed and kept in a state of\r\nsubjection, acts of intimidation were soon reported from all parts of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nHamilton, an able, determined, and fearless man, tried hard to curb\r\nthis terrorism, but public opinion being strong against him, he could\r\naccomplish little without military aid.  As department commander, I\r\nwas required, whenever called upon, to assist his government, and as\r\nthese requisitions for help became necessarily very frequent, the\r\nresult was that shortly after he assumed his duties, detachments of\r\ntroops were stationed in nearly every county of the State.  By such\r\ndisposition of my forces fairly good order was maintained under the\r\nadministration of Hamilton, and all went well till the inauguration\r\nof J. W. Throckmorton, who, elected Governor in pursuance of an\r\nauthorization granted by the convention which Hamilton had called\r\ntogether, assumed the duties of the office August 9, 1866.\r\n\r\nOne of Governor Throckmorton's first acts was to ask the withdrawal\r\nor non-interference of the military.  This was not all granted, but\r\nunder his ingenious persuasion President Johnson, on the 13th of\r\nAugust, 1866, directed that the new State officials be entrusted with\r\nthe unhampered control of civil affairs, and this was more than\r\nenough to revive the bulldozing methods that had characterized the\r\nbeginning of Hamilton's administration.  Oppressive legislation in\r\nthe shape of certain apprentice and vagrant laws quickly followed,\r\ndeveloping a policy of gross injustice toward the colored people on\r\nthe part of the courts, and a reign of lawlessness and disorder\r\nensued which, throughout the remote districts of the State at least,\r\ncontinued till Congress, by what are known as the Reconstruction\r\nActs, took into its own hands the rehabilitation of the seceded\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIn the State of Louisiana a provisional government, chosen by the\r\nloyal element, had been put in operation, as already mentioned, as\r\nearly as 1864.  This was effected under encouragement given by\r\nPresident Lincoln, through the medium of a Constitutional convention,\r\nwhich met at New Orleans in April, 1864, and adjourned in July.  The\r\nconstitution then agreed upon was submitted to the people, and in\r\nSeptember, 1864, was ratified by a vote of the few loyal residents of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nThe government provided under this constitution being looked upon as\r\nprovisional merely, was never recognized by Congress, and in 1865 the\r\nreturned Confederates, restored to citizenship by the President's\r\namnesty proclamation, soon got control of almost all the State.  The\r\nLegislature was in their hands, as well as most of the State and\r\nmunicipal offices; so, when the President, on the 20th of August,\r\n1866, by proclamation, extended his previous instructions regarding\r\ncivil affairs in Texas so as to have them apply to all the seceded\r\nStates, there at once began in Louisiana a system of discriminative\r\nlegislation directed against the freedmen, that led to flagrant\r\nwrongs in the enforcement of labor contracts, and in the remote\r\nparishes to numbers of outrages and murders.\r\n\r\nTo remedy this deplorable condition of things, it was proposed, by\r\nthose who had established the government of 1864, to remodel the\r\nconstitution of the State; and they sought to do this by reassembling\r\nthe convention, that body before its adjournment having provided for\r\nreconvening under certain conditions, in obedience to the call of its\r\npresident.  Therefore, early in the summer of 1866, many members of\r\nthis convention met in conference at New Orleans, and decided that a\r\nnecessity existed for reconvening the delegates, and a proclamation\r\nwas issued accordingly by B. K. Howell, President-pro-tempore.\r\n\r\nMayor John T.  Monroe and the other officials of New Orleans looked\r\nupon this proposed action as revolutionary, and by the time the\r\nconvention assembled (July 30), such bitterness of feeling prevailed\r\nthat efforts were made by the mayor and city police to suppress the\r\nmeeting.  A bloody riot followed, resulting, in the killing and\r\nwounding of about a hundred and sixty persons.\r\n\r\nI happened to be absent from the city at the time, returning from\r\nTexas, where I had been called by affairs on the Rio Grande.  On my\r\nway up from the mouth of the Mississippi I was met on the night of\r\nJuly 30 by one of my staff, who reported what had occurred, giving\r\nthe details of the massacre--no milder term is fitting--and informing\r\nme that, to prevent further slaughter, General Baird, the senior\r\nmilitary officer present, had assumed control of the municipal\r\ngovernment.  On reaching the city I made an investigation, and that\r\nnight sent the following report of the affair:\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE GULF,\r\n\"NEW ORLEANS, LA., Aug.  1, 1866.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL U. S. GRANT:\r\n\r\n\"You are doubtless aware of the serious riot which occurred in this\r\ncity on the 30th.  A political body, styling themselves the\r\nConvention of 1864, met on the 30th, for, as it is alleged, the\r\npurpose of remodeling the present constitution of the State.  The\r\nleaders were political agitators and revolutionary men, and the\r\naction of the convention was liable to produce breaches of the public\r\npeace.  I had made up my mind to arrest the head men, if the\r\nproceedings of the convention were calculated to disturb the\r\ntranquility of the Department; but I had no cause for action until\r\nthey committed the overt act.  In the meantime official duty called\r\nme to Texas, and the mayor of the city, during my absence suppressed\r\nthe convention by the use of the police force, and in so doing\r\nattacked the members of the convention, and a party of two hundred\r\nnegroes, with fire-arms, clubs, and knives, in a manner so\r\nunnecessary and atrocious as to compel me to say that it was murder.\r\nAbout forty whites and blacks were thus killed, and about one hundred\r\nand sixty wounded.  Everything is now quiet, but I deem it best to\r\nmaintain a military supremacy in the city for a few days, until the\r\naffair is fully investigated.  I believe the sentiment of the general\r\ncommunity is great regret at this unnecessary cruelty, and that the\r\npolice could have made any arrest they saw fit without sacrificing\r\nlives.\r\n\r\n\"P. H. SHERIDAN,\r\n\"Major-General Commanding.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn receiving the telegram, General Grant immediately submitted it\r\nto the President.  Much clamor being made at the North for the\r\npublication of the despatch, Mr. Johnson pretended to give it to the\r\nnewspapers.  It appeared in the issues of August 4, but with this\r\nparagraph omitted, viz.:\r\n\r\n\"I had made up my mind to arrest the head men, if the proceedings of\r\nthe convention were calculated to disturb the tranquility of the\r\nDepartment, but I had no cause for action until they committed the\r\novert act.  In the mean time official duty called me to Texas, and\r\nthe mayor of the city, during my absence, suppressed the convention\r\nby the use of the police force, and in so doing attacked the members\r\nof the convention, and a party of two hundred negroes, with\r\nfire-arms, clubs, and knives, in a manner so unnecessary and atrocious\r\nas to compel me to say it was murder.\"\r\n\r\nAgainst this garbling of my report--done by the President's own order\r\n--I strongly demurred; and this emphatic protest marks the beginning of\r\nMr. Johnson's well-known personal hostility toward me.  In the mean\r\ntime I received (on August 3) the following despatch from General Grant\r\napproving my course:\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n\"WAR DEPT., WASHINGTON, D. C., \"August 3, 1866--5 p.m.\r\n\r\n\"MAJOR-GENERAL P. H. SHERIDAN,\r\n\"Commanding Mil. Div. of the Gulf,\r\n\"New Orleans, La.\r\n\r\n\"Continue to enforce martial law, so far as may be necessary to\r\npreserve the peace; and do not allow any of the civil authorities to\r\nact, if you deem such action dangerous to the public safety.  Lose no\r\ntime in investigating and reporting the causes that led to the riot,\r\nand the facts which occurred.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT,\r\n\"Lieutenant-General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the President's directions, My report of August 1 was\r\nfollowed by another, more in detail, which I give in full, since it\r\ntells the whole story of the riot:\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE GULF,\r\n\"NEW ORLEANS, LA., August 6, 1866.\r\n\r\n\"His EXCELLENCY ANDREW JOHNSON,\r\n\"President United States.\r\n\r\n\"I have the honor to make the following reply to your despatch of\r\nAugust 4.  A very large number of colored people marched in\r\nprocession on Friday night, July twenty-seven (27), and were\r\naddressed from the steps of the City Hall by Dr. Dostie, ex-Governor\r\nHahn, and others.  The speech of Dostie was intemperate in language\r\nand sentiment.  The speeches of the others, so far as I can learn,\r\nwere characterized by moderation.  I have not given you the words of\r\nDostie's speech, as the version published was denied; but from what I\r\nhave learned of the man, I believe they were intemperate.\r\n\r\n\"The convention assembled at twelve (12) M.  on the thirtieth (30),\r\nthe timid members absenting themselves because the tone of the\r\ngeneral public was ominous of trouble.  I think there were about\r\ntwenty-six (26) members present.  In front of the Mechanics\r\nInstitute, where the meeting was held, there were assembled some\r\ncolored men, women, and children, perhaps eighteen (18) or twenty\r\n(20), and in the Institute a number of colored men, probably one\r\nhundred and fifty (150).  Among those outside and inside there might\r\nhave been a pistol in the possession of every tenth (10) man.\r\n\r\n\"About one (1) p. m.  a procession of say from sixty (60) to one\r\nhundred and thirty (130) colored men marched up Burgundy Street and\r\nacross Canal Street toward the convention, carrying an American flag.\r\nThese men had about one pistol to every ten men, and canes and clubs\r\nin addition.  While crossing Canal Street a row occurred.  There were\r\nmany spectators on the street, and their manner and tone toward the\r\nprocession unfriendly.  A shot was fired, by whom I am not able to\r\nstate, but believe it to have been by a policeman, or some colored\r\nman in the procession.  This led to other shots and a rush after the\r\nprocession.  On arrival at the front of the Institute there was some\r\nthrowing of brickbats by both sides.  The police, who had been held\r\nwell in hand, were vigorously marched to the scene of disorder.  The\r\nprocession entered the Institute with the flag, about six (6) or\r\neight (8) remaining outside.  A row occurred between a policeman and\r\none of these colored men, and a shot was again fired by one of the\r\nparties, which led to an indiscriminate fire on the building through\r\nthe windows by the policemen.  This had been going on for a short\r\ntime, when a white flag was displayed from the windows of the\r\nInstitute, whereupon the firing ceased, and the police rushed into\r\nthe building.\r\n\r\n\"From the testimony of wounded men, and others who were inside the\r\nbuilding, the policemen opened an indiscriminate fire upon the\r\naudience until they had emptied their revolvers, when they retired,\r\nand those inside barricaded the doors.  The door was broken in, and\r\nthe firing again commenced, when many of the colored and white people\r\neither escaped throughout the door or were passed out by the\r\npolicemen inside; but as they came out the policemen who formed the\r\ncircle nearest the building fired upon them, and they were again\r\nfired upon by the citizens that formed the outer circle.  Many of\r\nthose wounded and taken prisoners, and others who were prisoners and\r\nnot wounded, were fired upon by their captors and by citizens.  The\r\nwounded were stabbed while lying on the ground, and their heads\r\nbeaten with brickbats.  In the yard of the building, whither some of\r\nthe colored men had escaped and partially secreted themselves, they\r\nwere fired upon and killed or wounded by policemen.  Some were killed\r\nand wounded several squares from the scene.  Members of the\r\nconvention were wounded by the police while in their hands as\r\nprisoners, some of them mortally.\r\n\r\n\"The immediate cause of this terrible affair was the assemblage of\r\nthis Convention; the remote cause was the bitter and antagonistic\r\nfeeling which has been growing in this community since the advent of\r\nthe present Mayor, who, in the organization of his police force,\r\nselected many desperate men, and some of them known murderers.\r\nPeople of clear views were overawed by want of confidence in the\r\nMayor, and fear of the thugs, many of which he had selected for his\r\npolice force.  I have frequently been spoken to by prominent citizens\r\non this subject, and have heard them express fear, and want of\r\nconfidence in Mayor Monroe.  Ever since the intimation of this last\r\nconvention movement I must condemn the course of several of the city\r\npapers for supporting, by their articles, the bitter feeling of bad\r\nmen.  As to the merciless manner in which the convention was broken\r\nup, I feel obliged to confess strong repugnance.\r\n\r\n\"It is useless to disguise the hostility that exists on the part of a\r\ngreat many here toward Northern men, and this unfortunate affair has\r\nso precipitated matters that there is now a test of what shall be the\r\nstatus of Northern men--whether they can live here without being in\r\nconstant dread or not, whether they can be protected in life and\r\nproperty, and have justice in the courts.  If this matter is\r\npermitted to pass over without a thorough and determined prosecution\r\nof those engaged in it, we may look out for frequent scenes of the\r\nsame kind, not only here, but in other places.  No steps have as yet\r\nbeen taken by the civil authorities to arrest citizens who were\r\nengaged in this massacre, or policemen who perpetrated such\r\ncruelties.  The members of the convention have been indicted by the\r\ngrand jury, and many of them arrested and held to bail.  As to\r\nwhether the civil authorities can mete out ample justice to the\r\nguilty parties on both sides, I must say it is my opinion,\r\nunequivocally, that they cannot.  Judge Abell, whose course I have\r\nclosely watched for nearly a year, I now consider one of the most\r\ndangerous men that we have here to the peace and quiet of the city.\r\nThe leading men of the convention--King, Cutler, Hahn, and others\r\n--have been political agitators, and are bad men.  I regret to say that\r\nthe course of Governor Wells has been vacillating, and that during the\r\nlate trouble he has shown very little of the man.\r\n\r\n\"P. H. SHERIDAN,\r\n\"Major-General Commanding.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSubsequently a military commission investigated the subject of the\r\nriot, taking a great deal of testimony.  The commission substantially\r\nconfirmed the conclusions given in my despatches, and still later\r\nthere was an investigation by a select committee of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, of which the Honorables Samuel Shellabarger, of\r\nOhio, H. L. Elliot, of Massachusetts, and B. M. Boyer, of\r\nPennsylvania, were the members.  The majority report of the committee\r\nalso corroborated, in all essentials, my reports of the distressing\r\noccurrence.  The committee likewise called attention to a violent\r\nspeech made by Mr. Johnson at St. Louis in September, 1866, charging\r\nthe origin of the riot to Congress, and went on to say of the speech\r\nthat \"it was an unwarranted and unjust expression of hostile feeling,\r\nwithout pretext or foundation in fact.\"  A list of the killed and\r\nwounded was embraced in the committee's report, and among other\r\nconclusions reached were the following: \"That the meeting of July 30\r\nwas a meeting of quiet citizens, who came together without arms and\r\nwith intent peaceably to discuss questions of public concern....\r\nThere has been no occasion during our National history when a riot\r\nhas occurred so destitute of justifiable cause, resulting in a\r\nmassacre so inhuman and fiend-like, as that which took place at New\r\nOrleans on the 30th of July last.  This riotous attack upon the\r\nconvention, with its terrible results of massacre and murder, was not\r\nan accident.  It was the determined purpose of the mayor of the city\r\nof New Orleans to break up this convention by armed force.\"\r\n\r\nThe statement is also made, that, \"He [the President] knew that\r\n'rebels' and 'thugs' and disloyal men had controlled the election of\r\nMayor Monroe, and that such men composed chiefly his police force.\"\r\n\r\nThe committee held that no legal government existed in Louisiana, and\r\nrecommended the temporary establishment of a provisional government\r\ntherein; the report concluding that \"in the meantime the safety of\r\nall Union men within the State demands that such government be formed\r\nfor their protection, for the well being of the nation and the\r\npermanent peace of the Republic.\"\r\n\r\nThe New Orleans riot agitated the whole country, and the official and\r\nother reports served to intensify and concentrate the opposition to\r\nPresident Johnson's policy of reconstruction, a policy resting\r\nexclusively on and inspired solely by the executive authority--for it\r\nwas made plain, by his language and his acts, that he was seeking to\r\nrehabilitate the seceded States under conditions differing not a whit\r\nfrom those existing before the rebellion; that is to say, without the\r\nslightest constitutional provision regarding the status of the\r\nemancipated slaves, and with no assurances of protection for men who\r\nhad remained loyal in the war.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1866, Congress took hold of the subject with such vigor\r\nas to promise relief from all these perplexing disorders, and, after\r\nmuch investigation and a great deal of debate, there resulted the\r\nso-called \"Reconstruction Laws,\" which, for a clear understanding of\r\nthe powers conferred on the military commanders, I deem best to append\r\nin full:\r\n\r\nAN ACT to provide for the more efficient government of the rebel\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, no legal State governments or adequate protection for life\r\nor property now exist in the rebel States of Virginia, North\r\nCarolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana,\r\nFlorida, Texas, and Arkansas; and whereas, it is necessary that peace\r\nand good order should be enforced in said States until loyal and\r\nrepublican State governments can be legally established; therefore,\r\n\r\nBE IT ENACTED by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\nUnited States of America in Congress assembled, That said rebel\r\nStates shall be divided into military districts and made subject to\r\nthe military authority of the United States as hereinafter\r\nprescribed; and for that purpose Virginia shall constitute the first\r\ndistrict; North Carolina and South Carolina, the second district;\r\nGeorgia, Alabama, and Florida, the third district; Mississippi and\r\nArkansas, the fourth district; and Louisiana and Texas, the fifth\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nSEC. 2.

F. WADE,\r\nPresident of the Senate pro tempore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nPASSAGE OF THE RECONSTRUCTION ACT OVER THE PRESIDENT'S VETO--PLACED\r\nIN COMMAND OF THE FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT--REMOVING OFFICERS--MY\r\nREASONS FOR SUCH ACTION--AFFAIRS IN LOUISIANA AND TEXAS--REMOVAL OF\r\nGOVERNOR WELLS--REVISION OF THE JURY LISTS--RELIEVED FROM THE COMMAND\r\nOF THE FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT.\r\n\r\nThe first of the Reconstruction laws was passed March 2, 1867, and\r\nthough vetoed by the President, such was the unanimity of loyal\r\nsentiment and the urgency demanding the measure, that the bill became\r\na law over the veto the day the President returned it to Congress.\r\nMarch the 11th this law was published in General Orders No. 10, from\r\nthe Headquarters of the Army, the same order assigning certain\r\nofficers to take charge of the five military districts into which the\r\nStates lately in rebellion were subdivided, I being announced as the\r\ncommander of the Fifth Military District, which embraced Louisiana\r\nand Texas, a territory that had formed the main portion of my command\r\nsince the close of the war.\r\n\r\nBetween the date of the Act and that of my assignment, the Louisiana\r\nLegislature, then in special session, had rejected a proposed repeal\r\nof an Act it had previously passed providing for an election of\r\ncertain municipal officers in New Orleans.  This election was set for\r\nMarch 11, but the mayor and the chief of police, together with\r\nGeneral Mower, commanding the troops in the city, having expressed to\r\nme personally their fears that the public peace would be disturbed by\r\nthe election, I, in this emergency, though not yet assigned to the\r\ndistrict, assuming the authority which the Act conferred on district\r\ncommanders, declared that the election should not take place; that no\r\npolls should be opened on the day fixed; and that the whole matter\r\nwould stand postponed till the district commander should be\r\nappointed, or special instructions be had.  This, my first official\r\nact under the Reconstruction laws, was rendered necessary by the\r\ncourse of a body of obstructionists, who had already begun to give\r\nunequivocal indications of their intention to ignore the laws of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nA copy of the order embodying the Reconstruction law, together with\r\nmy assignment, having reached me a few days after, I regularly\r\nassumed control of the Fifth Military District on March 19, by an\r\norder wherein I declared the State and municipal governments of the\r\ndistrict to be provisional only, and, under the provisions of the\r\nsixth section of the Act, subject to be controlled, modified,\r\nsuperseded, or abolished.  I also announced that no removals from\r\noffice would be made unless the incumbents failed to carry out the\r\nprovisions of the law or impeded reorganization, or unless willful\r\ndelays should necessitate a change, and added: \"Pending the\r\nreorganization, it is, desirable and intended to create as little\r\ndisturbance in the machinery of the various branches of the\r\nprovisional governments as possible, consistent with the law of\r\nCongress and its successful execution, but this condition is\r\ndependent upon the disposition shown by the people, and upon the\r\nlength of time required for reorganization.\"\r\n\r\nUnder these limitations Louisiana and Texas retained their former\r\ndesignations as military districts, the officers in command\r\nexercising their military powers as heretofore.  In addition, these\r\nofficers were to carry out in their respective commands all\r\nprovisions of the law except those specially requiring the action of\r\nthe district commander, and in cases of removals from and appointment\r\nto office.\r\n\r\nIn the course of legislation the first Reconstruction act, as I have\r\nheretofore noted, had been vetoed.  On the very day of the veto,\r\nhowever, despite the President's adverse action, it passed each House\r\nof Congress by such an overwhelming majority as not only to give it\r\nthe effect of law, but to prove clearly that the plan of\r\nreconstruction presented was, beyond question, the policy endorsed by\r\nthe people of the country.  It was, therefore, my determination to\r\nsee to the law's zealous execution in my district, though I felt\r\ncertain that the President would endeavor to embarrass me by every\r\nmeans in his power, not only on account of his pronounced personal\r\nhostility, but also because of his determination not to execute but\r\nto obstruct the measures enacted by Congress.\r\n\r\nHaving come to this conclusion, I laid down, as a rule for my\r\nguidance, the principle of non-interference with the provisional\r\nState governments, and though many appeals were made to have me\r\nrescind rulings of the courts, or interpose to forestall some\r\npresupposed action to be taken by them, my invariable reply was that\r\nI would not take cognizance of such matters, except in cases of\r\nabsolute necessity.  The same policy was announced also in reference\r\nto municipal affairs throughout the district, so long as the action\r\nof the local officers did not conflict with the law.\r\n\r\nIn a very short time, however, I was obliged to interfere in\r\nmunicipal matters in New Orleans, for it had become clearly apparent\r\nthat several of the officials were, both by acts of omission and\r\ncommission, ignoring the law, so on the 27th of March I removed from\r\noffice the Mayor, John T.  Monroe; the Judge of the First District\r\nCourt, E. Abell; and the Attorney-General of the State, Andrew S.\r\nHerron; at the same time appointing to the respective offices thus\r\nvacated Edward Heath, W. W. Howe, and B. L. Lynch.  The officials\r\nthus removed had taken upon themselves from the start to pronounce\r\nthe Reconstruction acts unconstitutional, and to advise such a course\r\nof obstruction that I found it necessary at an early dav to replace\r\nthem by men in sympathy with the law, in order to make plain my\r\ndetermination to have its provisions enforced.  The President at once\r\nmade inquiry, through General Grant, for the cause of the removal,\r\nand I replied:\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT,\r\n\"New Orleans, La., April 19, 1867.\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL: On the 27th day of March last I removed from office Judge\r\nE. Abell, of the Criminal Court of New Orleans; Andrew S. Herron,\r\nAttorney-General of the State of Louisiana; and John T. Monroe, Mayor\r\nof the City of New Orleans.  These removals were made under the\r\npowers granted me in what is usually termed the 'military bill,'\r\npassed March 2, 1867, by the Congress of the United States.\r\n\r\n\"I did not deem it necessary to give any reason for the removal of\r\nthese men, especially after the investigations made by the military\r\nboard on the massacre Of July 30, 1866, and the report of the\r\ncongressional committee on the same massacre; but as some inquiry has\r\nbeen made for the cause of removal, I would respectfully state as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"The court over which judge Abell presided is the only criminal court\r\nin the city of New Orleans, and for a period of at least nine months\r\nprevious to the riot Of July 30 he had been educating a large portion\r\nof the community to the perpetration of this outrage, by almost\r\npromising no prosecution in his court against the offenders, in case\r\nsuch an event occurred.  The records of his court will show that he\r\nfulfilled his promise, as not one of the guilty has been prosecuted.\r\n\r\n\"In reference to Andrew J. Herron, Attorney-General of the State of\r\nLouisiana, I considered it his duty to indict these men before this\r\ncriminal court.  This he failed to do, but went so far as to attempt\r\nto impose on the good sense of the whole nation by indicting the\r\nvictims of the riot instead of the rioters; in other words, making\r\nthe innocent guilty and the guilty innocent.  He was therefore, in my\r\nbelief, an able coadjutor with judge Abell in bringing on the\r\nmassacre of July 30.\r\n\r\n\"Mayor Monroe controlled the element engaged in this riot, and when\r\nbacked by an attorney-general who would not prosecute the guilty, and\r\na judge who advised the grand jury to find the innocent guilty and\r\nlet the murderers go free, felt secure in engaging his police force\r\nin the riot and massacre.\r\n\r\n\"With these three men exercising a large influence over the worst\r\nelements of the population of this city, giving to those elements an\r\nimmunity for riot and bloodshed, the general-in-chief will see how\r\ninsecurely I felt in letting them occupy their respective positions\r\nin the troubles which might occur in registration and voting in the\r\nreorganization of this State.\r\n\r\n\"I am, General, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\"P. H. SHERIDAN,\r\n\"Major-General U. S. A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"GENERAL U. S. GRANT,\r\n\"Commanding Armies of the United States,\r\n\"Washington, D. C.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTo General Grant my reasons were satisfactory, but not so to the\r\nPresident, who took no steps, however, to rescind my action, for he\r\nknew that the removals were commended by well-nigh the entire\r\ncommunity in the city, for it will be understood that Mr. Johnson\r\nwas, through his friends and adherents in Louisiana and Texas, kept\r\nconstantly advised of every step taken by me.  Many of these persons\r\nwere active and open opponents of mine, while others were spies,\r\ndoing their work so secretly and quickly that sometimes Mr. Johnson\r\nknew of my official acts before I could report them to General Grant.\r\n\r\nThe supplemental Reconstruction act which defined the method of\r\nreconstruction became a law despite the President's veto on March 23.\r\nThis was a curative act, authorizing elections and prescribing\r\nmethods of registration.  When it reached me officially I began\r\nmeasures for carrying out its provisions, and on the 28th of March\r\nissued an order to the effect that no elections for the State,\r\nparish, or municipal officers would be held in Louisiana until the\r\nprovisions of the laws of Congress entitled \"An act to provide for\r\nthe more efficient government of the rebel States,\" and of the act\r\nsupplemental thereto, should have been complied with.  I also\r\nannounced that until elections were held in accordance with these\r\nacts, the law of the Legislature of the State providing for the\r\nholding over of those persons whose terms of office otherwise would\r\nhave expired, would govern in all cases excepting only those special\r\nones in which I myself might take action.  There was one parish,\r\nLivingston, which this order did no reach in time to prevent the\r\nelection previously ordered there, and which therefore took place,\r\nbut by a supplemental order this election was declare null and void.\r\n\r\nIn April.  I began the work of administering the Supplemental Law,\r\nwhich, under  certain condition of eligibility, required a\r\nregistration of the voter of the State, for the purpose of electing\r\ndelegate to a Constitutional convention.  It therefore became\r\nnecessary to appoint Boards of Registration throughout the election\r\ndistricts, and on April 10 the boards for the Parish of Orleans were\r\ngiven out, those for the other parishes being appointed ten days\r\nlater.  Before announcing these boards, I had asked to be advised\r\ndefinitely as to what persons were disfranchised by the law, and was\r\ndirected by General Grant to act upon my own interpretation of it,\r\npending an opinion expected shortly from the Attorney-General--Mr.\r\nHenry Stanbery--so, for the guidance of the boards, I gave the\r\nfollowing instructions:\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT.\r\n\"New Orleans, La., April 10, 1867.\r\n\r\n\"Special Orders, No. 15.\r\n\r\n\"....In obedience to the directions contained in the first section of\r\nthe Law of Congress entitled \"An Act supplemental to an Act entitled\r\n'An Act to provide for the more efficient government of the rebel\r\nStates'\" the registration of the legal voters, according to that law\r\nin the Parish of Orleans, will be commenced on the 15th instant, and\r\nmust be completed by the 15th of May.\r\n\r\n\"The four municipal districts of the City of New Orleans and the\r\nParish of Orleans, right bank (Algiers), will each constitute a\r\nRegistration district.  Election precincts will remain as at present\r\nconstituted.\r\n\r\n\"....Each member of the Board of Registers, before commencing his\r\nduties, will file in the office of the Assistant-Inspector-General at\r\nthese headquarters, the oath required in the sixth section of the Act\r\nreferred to, and be governed in the execution of his duty by the\r\nprovisions of the first section of that Act, faithfully administering\r\nthe oath therein prescribed to each person registered.\r\n\r\n\"Boards of Registers will immediately select suitable offices within\r\ntheir respective districts, having reference to convenience and\r\nfacility of registration, and will enter upon their duties on the day\r\ndesignated.  Each Board will be entitled to two clerks.  Office-hours\r\nfor registration will be from 8 o'clock till 12 A. M., and from 4\r\ntill 7 P. M.\r\n\r\n\"When elections are ordered, the Board of Registers for each district\r\nwill designate the number of polls and the places where they shall be\r\nopened in the election precincts within its district, appoint the\r\ncommissioners and other officers necessary for properly conducting\r\nthe elections, and will superintend the same.\r\n\r\n\"They will also receive from the commissioners of elections of the\r\ndifferent precincts the result of the vote, consolidate the same, and\r\nforward it to the commanding general.\r\n\r\n\"Registers and all officers connected with elections will be held to\r\na rigid accountability and will be subject to trial by military\r\ncommission for fraud, or unlawful or improper conduct in the\r\nperformance of their duties.  Their rate of compensation and manner\r\nof payment will be in accordance with the provisions of sections six\r\nand seven of the supplemental act.\r\n\r\n\"....Every male citizen of the United States, twenty-one years old\r\nand upward, of whatever race, color, or previous condition, who has\r\nbeen resident in the State of Louisiana for one year and Parish of\r\nOrleans for three months previous to the date at which he presents\r\nhimself for registration, and who has not been disfranchised by act\r\nof Congress or for felony at common law, shall, after having taken\r\nand subscribed the oath prescribed in the first section of the act\r\nherein referred to, be entitled to be, and shall be, registered as a\r\nlegal voter in the Parish of Orleans and State of Louisiana.\r\n\r\n\"Pending the decision of the Attorney-General of the United States on\r\nthe question as to who are disfranchised by law, registers will give\r\nthe most rigid interpretation to the law, and exclude from\r\nregistration every person about whose right to vote there may be a\r\ndoubt.  Any person so excluded who may, under the decision of the\r\nAttorney-General, be entitled to vote, shall be permitted to register\r\nafter that decision is received, due notice of which will be given.\r\n\r\n\"By command of Major-General P. H. SHERIDAN,\r\n\r\n\"GEO. L. HARTSUFF,\r\n\"Assistant Adjutant-General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parish Boards of Registration were composed of three members\r\neach.  Ability to take what was known as the \"ironclad oath\" was the\r\nqualification exacted of the members, and they were prohibited from\r\nbecoming candidates for office.  In the execution of their duties\r\nthey were to be governed by the provisions of the supplemental act.\r\nIt was also made one of their functions to designate the number and\r\nlocation of the polling-places in the several districts, to appoint\r\ncommissioners for receiving the votes and in general to attend to\r\nsuch other matters as were necessary, in order properly to conduct\r\nthe voting, and afterward to receive from the commissioners the\r\nresult of the vote and forward it to my headquarters.  These\r\nregisters, and all other officers having to do with elections, were\r\nto be held to a rigid accountability, and be subject to trial by\r\nmilitary commission for fraud or unlawful or improper conduct in the\r\nperformance of their duties; and in order to be certain that the\r\nRegistration Boards performed their work faithfully and\r\nintelligently, officers of the army were appointed as supervisors.\r\nTo this end the parishes were grouped together conveniently in\r\ntemporary districts, each officer having from three to five parishes\r\nto supervise.  The programme thus mapped out for carrying out the law\r\nin Louisiana was likewise adhered to in Texas, and indeed was\r\nfollowed as a model in some of the other military districts.\r\n\r\nAlthough Military Commissions were fully authorized by the\r\nReconstruction acts, yet I did not favor their use in governing the\r\ndistrict, and probably would never have convened one had these acts\r\nbeen observed in good faith.  I much preferred that the civil courts,\r\nand the State and municipal authorities already in existence, should\r\nperform their functions without military control or interference, but\r\noccasionally, because the civil authorities neglected their duty, I\r\nwas obliged to resort to this means to ensure the punishment Of\r\noffenders.  At this time the condition of the negroes in Texas and\r\nLouisiana was lamentable, though, in fact, not worse than that of the\r\nfew white loyalists who had been true to the Union during the war.\r\nThese last were singled out as special objects of attack, and were,\r\ntherefore, obliged at all times to be on the alert for the protection\r\nof their lives and property.  This was the natural outcome of Mr.\r\nJohnson's defiance of Congress, coupled with the sudden conversion to\r\nhis cause of persons in the North--who but a short time before had\r\nbeen his bitterest enemies; for all this had aroused among the\r\ndisaffected element new hopes of power and place, hopes of being at\r\nonce put in political control again, with a resumption of their\r\nfunctions in State and National matters without any preliminary\r\nauthorization by Congress.  In fact, it was not only hoped, but\r\nexpected, that things were presently to go on just as if there had\r\nbeen no war.\r\n\r\nIn the State of Texas there were in 1865 about 200,000 of the colored\r\nrace-roughly, a third of the entire population--while in Louisiana\r\nthere were not less than 350,000, or more than one-half of all the\r\npeople in the State.  Until the enactment of the Reconstruction laws\r\nthese negroes were without rights, and though they had been liberated\r\nby the war, Mr. Johnson's policy now proposed that they should have\r\nno political status at all, and consequently be at the mercy of a\r\npeople who, recently their masters, now seemed to look upon them as\r\nthe authors of all the misfortunes that had come upon the land.\r\nUnder these circumstances the blacks naturally turned for protection\r\nto those who had been the means of their liberation, and it would\r\nhave been little less than inhuman to deny them sympathy.  Their\r\nfreedom had been given them, and it was the plain duty of those in\r\nauthority to make it secure, and screen them from the bitter\r\npolitical resentment that beset them, and to see that they had a fair\r\nchance in the battle of life.  Therefore, when outrages and murders\r\ngrew frequent, and the aid of the military power was an absolute\r\nnecessity for the protection of life, I employed it unhesitatingly\r\n--the guilty parties being brought to trial before military\r\ncommissions--and for a time, at least, there occurred a halt in the\r\nmarch of terrorism inaugurated by the people whom Mr. Johnson had\r\ndeluded.\r\n\r\nThe first, Military Commission was convened to try the case of John\r\nW. Walker, charged with shooting a negro in the parish of St. John.\r\nThe proper civil authorities had made no effort to arrest Walker, and\r\neven connived at his escape, so I had him taken into custody in New\r\nOrleans, and ordered him tried, the commission finding him guilty,\r\nand sentencing him to confinement in the penitentiary for six months.\r\nThis shooting was the third occurrence of the kind that had taken\r\nplace in St.  John's parish, a negro being wounded in each case, and\r\nit was plain that the intention was to institute there a practice of\r\nintimidation which should be effective to subject the freedmen to the\r\nwill of their late masters, whether in making labor contracts, or in\r\ncase these newly enfranchised negroes should evince a disposition to\r\navail themselves of the privilege to vote.\r\n\r\nThe trial and conviction of Walker, and of one or two others for\r\nsimilar outrages, soon put a stop to every kind of \"bull-dozing\" in\r\nthe country parishes; but about this time I discovered that many\r\nmembers of the police force in New Orleans were covertly intimidating\r\nthe freedmen there, and preventing their appearance at the\r\nregistration offices, using milder methods than had obtained in the\r\ncountry, it is true, but none the less effective.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1866 the Legislature had passed an act which created for the\r\npolice of New Orleans a residence qualification, the object of which\r\nwas to discharge and exclude from the force ex-Union soldiers.  This\r\nof course would make room for the appointment of ex-Confederates, and\r\nMayor Monroe had not been slow in enforcing the provisions of the\r\nlaw.  It was, in fact, a result of this enactment that the police was\r\nso reorganized as to become the willing and efficient tool which it\r\nproved to be in the riot of 1866; and having still the same\r\npersonnel, it was now in shape to prevent registration by threats,\r\nunwarranted arrests, and by various other influences, all operating\r\nto keep the timid blacks away from the registration places.\r\n\r\nThat the police were taking a hand in this practice of repression, I\r\nfirst discovered by the conduct of the assistant to the chief of the\r\nbody, and at once removed the offender, but finding this ineffectual\r\nI annulled that part of the State law fixing the five years'\r\nresidence restriction, and restored the two years' qualification,\r\nthus enabling Mayor Heath, who by my appointment had succeeded\r\nMonroe, to organize the force anew, and take about one-half of its\r\nmembers from ex-Union soldiers who when discharged had settled in New\r\nOrleans.  This action put an end to intimidation in the parish of\r\nOrleans; and now were put in operation in all sections the processes\r\nprovided by the supplemental Reconstruction law for the summoning of\r\na convention to form a Constitution preparatory to the readmission of\r\nthe State, and I was full of hope that there would now be much less\r\ndifficulty in administering the trust imposed by Congress.\r\n\r\nDuring the two years previous great damage had been done the\r\nagricultural interests of Louisiana by the overflow of the\r\nMississippi, the levees being so badly broken as to require extensive\r\nrepairs, and the Legislature of 1866 had appropriated for the purpose\r\n$4,000,000, to be raised by an issue of bonds.  This money was to be\r\ndisbursed by a Board of Levee Commissioners then in existence, but\r\nthe term of service of these commissioners, and the law creating the\r\nboard, would expire in the spring of 1867.  In order to overcome this\r\ndifficulty the Legislature passed a bill continuing the commissioners\r\nin office but as the act was passed inside of ten days before the\r\nadjournment of the Legislature, Governor Wells pocketed the bill, and\r\nit failed to become a law.  The Governor then appointed a board of\r\nhis own, without any warrant of law whatever.  The old commissioners\r\nrefused to recognize this new board, and of course a conflict of\r\nauthority ensued, which, it was clear, would lead to vicious results\r\nif allowed to continue; so, as the people of the State had no\r\nconfidence in either of the boards, I decided to end the contention\r\nsummarily by appointing an entirely new commission, which would\r\ndisburse the money honestly, and further the real purpose for which\r\nit had been appropriated.  When I took this course the legislative\r\nboard acquiesced, but Governor Wells immediately requested the\r\nPresident to revoke my order, which, however, was not done, but\r\nmeanwhile the Secretary of War directed me to suspend all proceedings\r\nin the matter, and make a report of the facts.  I complied in the\r\nfollowing telegram:\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT,\r\n\"NEW ORLEANS, La., June 3, 1867.\r\n\r\n\"SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram of\r\nthis date in reference to the Levee Commissioners in this State.\r\n\r\n\"The following were my reasons for abolishing the two former boards,\r\nalthough I intended that my order should be sufficiently explanatory:\r\n\r\n\"Previous to the adjournment of the Legislature last winter it passed\r\nan act continuing the old Levee board in office, so that the four\r\nmillions of dollars ($4,000,000) in bonds appropriated by the\r\nLegislature might be disbursed by a board of rebellious antecedents.\r\n\r\n\"After its adjournment the Governor of the State appointed a board of\r\nhis own, in violation of this act, and made the acknowledgment to me\r\nin person that his object was to disburse the money in the interest\r\nof his own party by securing for it the vote of the employees at the\r\ntime of election.\r\n\r\n\"The board continued in office by the Legislature refused to turn\r\nover to the Governor's board, and each side appealed to me to sustain\r\nit, which I would not do.  The question must then have gone to the\r\ncourts, which, according to the Governor's judgment when he was\r\nappealing to me to be sustained, would require one year for decision.\r\nMeantime the State was overflowed, the Levee boards tied up by\r\npolitical chicanery, and nothing done to relieve the poor people, now\r\nfed by the charity of the Government and charitable associations of\r\nthe North.\r\n\r\n\"To obviate this trouble, and to secure to the overflowed districts\r\nof the State the immediate relief which the honest disbursement of\r\nthe four millions ($4,000,000) would give, my order dissolving both\r\nboards was issued.\r\n\r\n\"I say now, unequivocally, that Governor Wells is a political\r\ntrickster and a dishonest man.  I have seen him myself, when I first\r\ncame to this command, turn out all the Union men who had supported\r\nthe Government, and put in their stead rebel soldiers who had not yet\r\ndoffed their gray uniform.  I have seen him again, during the July\r\nriot of 1866, skulk away where I could not find him to give him a\r\nguard, instead of coming out as a manly representative of the State\r\nand joining those who were preserving the peace.  I have watched him\r\nsince, and his conduct has been as sinuous as the mark left in the\r\ndust by the movement of a snake.\r\n\r\n\"I say again that he is dishonest, and that dishonesty is more than\r\nmust be expected of me.\r\n\r\n\"P. H. SHERIDAN,\r\n\"Major-General, U. S. A.\r\n\r\n\"Hon. E. M. STANTON,\r\n\"Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same day that I sent my report to the Secretary of War I removed\r\nfrom office Governor Wells himself, being determined to bear no\r\nlonger with the many obstructions he had placed in the way of\r\nreorganizing the civil affairs of the State.  I was also satisfied\r\nthat he was unfit to retain the place, since he was availing himself\r\nof every opportunity to work political ends beneficial to himself.\r\nIn this instance Wells protested to me against his removal, and also\r\nappealed to the President for an opinion of the Attorney-General as\r\nto my power in the case; and doubtless he would have succeeded in\r\nretaining his office, but for the fact that the President had been\r\ninformed by General James B. Steadman and others placed to watch me\r\nthat Wells was wholly unworthy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"NEW ORLEANS, June 19, 1867.\r\n\"ANDREW JOHNSON, President United States,\r\n\"Washington City:\r\n\r\n\"Lewis D.  Campbell leaves New Orleans for home this evening.  Want\r\nof respect for Governor Wells personally, alone represses the\r\nexpression of indignation felt by all honest and sensible men at the\r\nunwarranted usurpation of General Sheridan in removing the civil\r\nofficers of Louisiana.  It is believed here that you will reinstate\r\nWells.  He is a bad man, and has no influence.\r\n\r\n\"I believe Sheridan made the removals to embarrass you, believing the\r\nfeeling at the North would sustain him.  My conviction is that on\r\naccount of the bad character of Wells and Monroe, you ought not to\r\nreinstate any who have been removed, because you cannot reinstate any\r\nwithout reinstating all, but you ought to prohibit the exercise of\r\nthis power in the future.\r\n\r\n\"Respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n\"JAMES B. STEADMAN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI appointed Mr. Thomas J. Durant as Wells's successor, but he\r\ndeclining, I then appointed Mr. Benjamin F. Flanders, who, after I\r\nhad sent a staff-officer to forcibly eject Wells in case of\r\nnecessity, took possession of the Governor's office.  Wells having\r\nvacated, Governor Flanders began immediately the exercise of his\r\nduties in sympathy with the views of Congress, and I then notified\r\nGeneral Grant that I thought he need have no further apprehension\r\nabout the condition of affairs in Louisiana, as my appointee was a\r\nman of such integrity and ability that I already felt relieved of\r\nhalf my labor.  I also stated in the same despatch that nothing would\r\nanswer in Louisiana but a bold and firm course, and that in taking\r\nsuch a one I felt that I was strongly supported; a statement that was\r\nthen correct, for up to this period the better classes were disposed\r\nto accept the Congressional plan of reconstruction.\r\n\r\nDuring the controversy over the Levee Commissioners, and the\r\ncorrespondence regarding the removal of Governor Wells, registration\r\nhad gone on under the rules laid down for the boards.  The date set\r\nfor closing the books was the 30th of June, but in the parish of\r\nOrleans the time was extended till the 15th of July.  This the\r\nPresident considered too short a period, and therefore directed the\r\nregistry lists not to be closed before the 1st of August, unless\r\nthere was some good reason to the contrary.  This was plainly\r\ndesigned to keep the books open in order that under the\r\nAttorney-General's interpretation of the Reconstruction laws, published\r\nJune 20, many persons who had been excluded by the registration boards\r\ncould yet be registered, so I decided to close the registration, unless\r\nrequired by the President unconditionally, and in specific orders, to\r\nextend the time.  My motives were manifold, but the main reasons were\r\nthat as two and a half months had been given already, the number of\r\npersons who, under the law, were qualified for registry was about\r\nexhausted; and because of the expense I did not feel warranted in\r\nkeeping up the boards longer, as I said, \"to suit new issues coming in\r\nat the eleventh hour,\" which would but open a \"broad macadamized road\r\nfor perjury and fraud.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I thus stated what I intended to do, the opinion of the\r\nAttorney-General had not yet been received.  When it did reach me it\r\nwas merely in the form of a circular signed by Adjutant-General\r\nTownsend, and had no force of law.  It was not even sent as an order,\r\nnor was it accompanied by any instructions, or by anything except the\r\nstatement that it was transmitted to the 11 respective military\r\ncommanders for their information, in order that there might be\r\nuniformity in the execution  of the Reconstruction acts.  To adopt\r\nMr. Stanbery's interpretation of the law and reopen registration\r\naccordingly, would defeat the purpose of Congress, as well as add to\r\nmy perplexities.  Such a course would also require that the officers\r\nappointed by me for the performance of specified duties, under laws\r\nwhich I was empowered to interpret and enforce, should receive their\r\nguidance and instructions from an unauthorized source, so on\r\ncommunicating with General Grant as to how I should act, he directed\r\nme to enforce my own construction of the military bill until ordered\r\nto do otherwise.\r\n\r\nTherefore the registration continued as I had originally directed,\r\nand nothing having been definitely settled at Washington in relation\r\nto my extending the time, on the 10th of July I ordered all the\r\nregistration boards to select, immediately, suitable persons to act\r\nas commissioners of election, and at the same time specified the\r\nnumber of each set of commissioners, designated the polling-places,\r\ngave notice that two days would be allowed for voting, and followed\r\nthis with an order discontinuing registration the 31st of July, and\r\nthen another appointing the 27th and 28th of September as the time\r\nfor the election of delegates to the State convention.\r\n\r\nIn accomplishing the registration there had been little opposition\r\nfrom the mass of the people, but the press of New Orleans, and the\r\noffice-holders and office-seekers in the State generally, antagonized\r\nthe work bitterly and violently, particularly after the promulgation\r\nof the opinion of the Attorney-General.  These agitators condemned\r\neverybody and everything connected with the Congressional plan of\r\nreconstruction; and the pernicious influence thus exerted was\r\nmanifested in various ways, but most notably in the selection of\r\npersons to compose the jury lists in the country parishes it also\r\ntempted certain municipal officers in New Orleans to perform illegal\r\nacts that would seriously have affected the credit of the city had\r\nmatters not been promptly corrected by the summary removal from\r\noffice of the comptroller and the treasurer, who had already issued a\r\nquarter of a million dollars in illegal certificates.  On learning of\r\nthis unwarranted and unlawful proceeding, Mayor Heath demanded an\r\ninvestigation by the Common Council, but this body, taking its cue\r\nfrom the evident intention of the President to render abortive the\r\nReconstruction acts, refused the mayor's demand.  Then he tried to\r\nhave the treasurer and comptroller restrained by injunction, but the\r\ncity attorney, under the same inspiration as the council, declined to\r\nsue out a writ, and the attorney being supported in this course by\r\nnearly all the other officials, the mayor was left helpless in his\r\nendeavors to preserve the city's credit.  Under such circumstances he\r\ntook the only step left him--recourse to the military commander; and\r\nafter looking into the matter carefully I decided, in the early part\r\nof August, to give the mayor officials who would not refuse to make\r\nan investigation of the illegal issue of certificates, and to this\r\nend I removed the treasurer, surveyor, comptroller, city attorney,\r\nand twenty-two of the aldermen; these officials, and all of their\r\nassistants, having reduced the financial credit of New Orleans to a\r\ndisordered condition, and also having made efforts--and being then\r\nengaged in such--to hamper the execution of the Reconstruction laws.\r\n\r\nThis action settled matters in the city, but subsequently I had to\r\nremove some officials in the parishes--among them a justice of the\r\npeace and a sheriff in the parish of Rapides; the justice for\r\nrefusing to permit negro witnesses to testify in a certain murder\r\ncase, and for allowing the murderer, who had foully killed a colored\r\nman, to walk out of his court on bail in the insignificant sum of\r\nfive hundred dollars; and the sheriff, for conniving at the escape\r\nfrom jail of another alleged murderer.  Finding, however, even after\r\nthese removals, that in the country districts murderers and other\r\ncriminals went unpunished, provided the offenses were against negroes\r\nmerely (since the jurors were selected exclusively from the whites,\r\nand often embraced those excluded from the exercise of the election\r\nfranchise) I, having full authority under the Reconstruction laws,\r\ndirected such a revision of the jury lists as would reject from them\r\nevery man not eligible for registration as a voter.  This order was\r\nissued August 24, and on its promulgation the President relieved me\r\nfrom duty and assigned General Hancock as my successor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS FIFTH MILITARY DISTRICT,\r\n\"NEW ORLEANS, LA., August 24, 1867.\r\n\r\n\"SPECIAL ORDERS, No.  125.\r\n\r\n\"The registration of voters of the State of Louisiana, according to\r\nthe law of Congress, being complete, it is hereby ordered that no\r\nperson who is not registered in accordance with said law shall be\r\nconsidered as, a duly qualified voter of the State of Louisiana.  All\r\npersons duly registered as above, and no others, are consequently\r\neligible, under the laws of the State of Louisiana, to serve as\r\njurors in any of the courts of the State.\r\n\r\n\"The necessary revision of the jury lists will immediately be made by\r\nthe proper officers.\r\n\r\n\"All the laws of the State respecting exemptions, etc., from jury\r\nduty will remain in force.\r\n\r\n\"By command of Major-General P. H. SHERIDAN.\r\n\r\n\"GEO. L. HARTNUFF, Asst. Adj't-General.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPending the arrival of General Hancock, I turned over the command of\r\nthe district September 1 to General Charles Griffin; but he dying of\r\nyellow fever, General J. A. Mower succeeded him, and retained command\r\ntill November 29, on which date General Hancock assumed control.\r\nImmediately after Hancock took charge, he revoked my order of August\r\n24 providing for a revision of the jury lists; and, in short,\r\nPresident Johnson's policy now became supreme, till Hancock himself\r\nwas relieved in March, 1868.\r\n\r\nMy official connection with the reconstruction of Louisiana and Texas\r\npractically closed with this order concerning the jury lists.  In my\r\njudgment this had become a necessity, for the disaffected element,\r\nsustained as it was by the open sympathy of the President, had grown\r\nso determined in its opposition to the execution of the\r\nReconstruction acts that I resolved to remove from place and power\r\nall obstacles; for the summer's experience had convinced me that in\r\nno other way could the law be faithfully administered.\r\n\r\nThe President had long been dissatisfied with my course; indeed, he\r\nhad harbored personal enmity against me ever since he perceived that\r\nhe could not bend me to an acceptance of the false position in which\r\nhe had tried to place me by garbling my report of the riot of 1866.\r\nWhen Mr. Johnson decided to remove me, General Grant protested in\r\nthese terms, but to no purpose:\r\n\r\n\"HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n\"WASHINGTON, D. C., August 17, 1867\r\n\r\n\"SIR: I am in receipt of your order of this date directing the\r\nassignment of General G. H. Thomas to the command of the Fifth\r\nMilitary District, General Sheridan to the Department of the\r\nMissouri, and General Hancock to the Department of the Cumberland;\r\nalso your note of this date (enclosing these instructions), saying:\r\n'Before you issue instructions to carry into effect the enclosed\r\norder, I would be pleased to hear any suggestions you may deem\r\nnecessary respecting the assignments to which the order refers.'\r\n\r\n\"I am pleased to avail myself of this invitation to urge--earnestly\r\nurge--urge in the name of a patriotic people, who have sacrificed\r\nhundreds of thousands of loyal lives and thousands of millions of\r\ntreasure to preserve the integrity and union of this country--that\r\nthis order be not insisted on.  It is unmistakably the expressed wish\r\nof the country that General Sheridan should not be removed from his\r\npresent command.\r\n\r\n\"This is a republic where the will of the people is the law of the\r\nland.  I beg that their voice may be heard.\r\n\r\n\"General Sheridan has performed his civil duties faithfully and\r\nintelligently.  His removal will only be regarded as an effort to\r\ndefeat the laws of Congress.  It will be interpreted by the\r\nunreconstructed element in the South--those who did all they could to\r\nbreak up this Government by arms, and now wish to be the only element\r\nconsulted as to the method of restoring order--as a triumph.  It will\r\nembolden them to renewed opposition to the will of the loyal masses,\r\nbelieving that they have the Executive with them.\r\n\r\n\"The services of General Thomas in battling for the Union entitle him\r\nto some consideration.  He has repeatedly entered his protest against\r\nbeing assigned to either of the five military districts, and\r\nespecially to being assigned to relieve General Sheridan.\r\n\r\n\"There are military reasons, pecuniary reasons, and above all,\r\npatriotic reasons, why this should not be insisted upon.\r\n\r\n\"I beg to refer to a letter marked 'private,' which I wrote to the\r\nPresident when first consulted on the subject of the change in the\r\nWar Department.  It bears upon the subject of this removal, and I had\r\nhoped would have prevented it.\r\n\r\n\"I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT,\r\n\"General U. S. A., Secretary of War ad interim.\r\n\r\n\"His Excellency A. JOHNSON,\r\n\"President of the United States.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI was ordered to command the Department of the Missouri (General\r\nHancock, as already noted, finally becoming my successor in the Fifth\r\nMilitary District), and left New Orleans on the 5th of September.  I\r\nwas not loath to go.  The kind of duty I had been performing in\r\nLouisiana and Texas was very trying under the most favorable\r\ncircumstances, but all the more so in my case, since I had to contend\r\nagainst the obstructions which the President placed in the way from\r\npersistent opposition to the acts of Congress as well as from\r\nantipathy to me--which obstructions he interposed with all the\r\nboldness and aggressiveness of his peculiar nature.\r\n\r\nOn more than one occasion while I was exercising this command,\r\nimpurity of motive was imputed to me, but it has never been\r\ntruthfully shown (nor can it ever be) that political or corrupt\r\ninfluences of any kind controlled me in any instance.  I simply tried\r\nto carry out, without fear or favor, the Reconstruction acts as they\r\ncame to me.  They were intended to disfranchise certain persons, and\r\nto enfranchise certain others, and, till decided otherwise, were the\r\nlaws of the land; and it was my duty to execute them faithfully,\r\nwithout regard, on the one hand, for those upon whom it was thought\r\nthey bore so heavily, nor, on the other, for this or that political\r\nparty, and certainly without deference to those persons sent to\r\nLouisiana to influence my conduct of affairs.\r\n\r\nSome of these missionaries were high officials, both military and\r\ncivil, and I recall among others a visit made me in 1866 by a\r\ndistinguished friend of the President, Mr. Thomas A. Hendricks.  The\r\npurpose of his coming was to convey to me assurances of the very high\r\nesteem in which I was held by the President, and to explain\r\npersonally Mr. Johnson's plan of reconstruction, its flawless\r\nconstitutionality, and so on.  But being on the ground, I had before\r\nme the exhibition of its practical working, saw the oppression and\r\nexcesses growing out of it, and in the face of these experiences even\r\nMr. Hendricks's persuasive eloquence was powerless to convince me of\r\nits beneficence.  Later General Lovell H. Rousseau came down on a\r\nlike mission, but was no more successful than Mr. Hendricks.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole period that I commanded in Louisiana and Texas my\r\nposition was a most unenviable one.  The service was unusual, and the\r\nnature of it scarcely to be understood by those not entirely familiar\r\nwith the conditions existing immediately after the war.  In\r\nadministering the affairs of those States, I never acted except by\r\nauthority, and always from conscientious motives.  I tried to guard\r\nthe rights of everybody in accordance with the law.  In this I was\r\nsupported by General Grant and opposed by President Johnson.  The\r\nformer had at heart, above every other consideration, the good of his\r\ncountry, and always sustained me with approval and kind suggestions.\r\nThe course pursued by the President was exactly the opposite, and\r\nseems to prove that in the whole matter of reconstruction he was\r\ngoverned less by patriotic motives than by personal ambitions.  Add\r\nto this his natural obstinacy of character and personal enmity toward\r\nme, and no surprise should be occasioned when I say that I heartily\r\nwelcomed the order that lifted from me my unsought burden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nAT FORT LEAVENWORTH--THE TREATY OF MEDICINE LODGE--GOING TO FORT\r\nDODGE--DISCONTENTED INDIANS--INDIAN OUTRAGES--A DELEGATION OF CHIEFS\r\n--TERRIBLE INDIAN RAID--DEATH OF COMSTOCK--VAST HERDS OF BUFFALO\r\n--PREPARING FOR A WINTER CAMPAIGN--MEETING \"BUFFALO BILL\"\r\n--HE UNDERTAKES A DANGEROUS TASK--FORSYTH'S GALLANT FIGHT--RESCUED.\r\n\r\nThe headquarters of the military department to which I was assigned\r\nwhen relieved from duty at New Orleans was at Fort Leavenworth,\r\nKansas, and on the 5th of September I started for that post.  In due\r\ntime I reached St. Louis, and stopped there a day to accept an\r\novation tendered in approval of the course I had pursued in the Fifth\r\nMilitary District--a public demonstration apparently of the most\r\nsincere and hearty character.\r\n\r\nFrom St. Louis to Leavenworth took but one night, and the next day I\r\ntechnically complied with my orders far enough to permit General\r\nHancock to leave the department, so that he might go immediately to\r\nNew Orleans if he so desired, but on account of the yellow fever\r\nepidemic then prevailing, he did not reach the city till late in\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\nMy new command was one of the four military departments that composed\r\nthe geographical division then commanded by Lieutenant-General\r\nSherman.  This division had been formed in 1866, with a view to\r\ncontrolling the Indians west of the Missouri River, they having\r\nbecome very restless and troublesome because of the building of the\r\nPacific railroads through their hunting-grounds, and the\r\nencroachments of pioneers, who began settling in middle and western\r\nKansas and eastern Colorado immediately after the war.\r\n\r\nMy department embraced the States of Missouri and Kansas, the Indian\r\nTerritory, and New Mexico.  Part of this section of country--western\r\nKansas particularly--had been frequently disturbed and harassed\r\nduring two or three years past, the savages every now and then\r\nmassacring an isolated family, boldly attacking the surveying and\r\nconstruction parties of the Kansas-Pacific railroad, sweeping down on\r\nemigrant trains, plundering and burning stage-stations and the like\r\nalong the Smoky Hill route to Denver and the Arkansas route to New\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I relieved Hancock, the department was comparatively\r\nquiet.  Though some military operations had been conducted against\r\nthe hostile tribes in the early part of the previous summer, all\r\nactive work was now suspended in the attempt to conclude a permanent\r\npeace with the Cheyennes, Arapahoes, Kiowas, and Comanches, in\r\ncompliance with the act of Congress creating what was known as the\r\nIndian Peace Commission of 1867.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances there was little necessity for my remaining\r\nat Leavenworth, and as I was much run down in health from the\r\nLouisiana climate, in which I had been obliged to live continuously\r\nfor three summers (one of which brought epidemic cholera, and another\r\na scourge of yellow fever), I took a leave of absence for a few\r\nmonths, leaving Colonel A. J. Smith, of the Seventh Cavalry,\r\ntemporarily in charge of my command.\r\n\r\nOn this account I did not actually go on duty in the department of\r\nthe Missouri till March, 1868.  On getting back I learned that the\r\nnegotiations of the Peace Commissioners held at Medicine Lodge, about\r\nseventy miles south of Fort Larned had resulted in a treaty with the\r\nCheyennes, Arapahoes, Kiowas, and Comanches, by which agreement it\r\nwas supposed all troubles had been settled.  The compact, as\r\nconcluded, contained numerous provisions, the most important to us\r\nbeing one which practically relinquished the country between the\r\nArkansas and Platte rivers for white settlement; another permitted\r\nthe peaceable construction of the Pacific railroads through the same\r\nregion; and a third requiring the tribes signing the treaty to retire\r\nto reservations allotted them in the Indian Territory.  Although the\r\nchiefs and head-men were well-nigh unanimous in ratifying these\r\nconcessions, it was discovered in the spring of 1868 that many of the\r\nyoung men were bitterly opposed to what had been done, and claimed\r\nthat most of the signatures had been obtained by misrepresentation\r\nand through proffers of certain annuities, and promises of arms and\r\nammunition to be issued in the spring of 1868.  This grumbling was\r\nvery general in extent, and during the winter found outlet in\r\noccasional marauding, so, fearing a renewal of the pillaging and\r\nplundering at an early day, to prepare myself for the work evidently\r\nahead the first thing I did on assuming permanent command was to make\r\na trip to Fort Larned and Fort Dodge, near which places the bulk of\r\nthe Indians had congregated on Pawnee and Walnut creeks.  I wanted to\r\nget near enough to the camps to find out for myself the actual state\r\nof feeling among the savages, and also to familiarize myself with the\r\ncharacteristics of the Plains Indians, for my previous experience had\r\nbeen mainly with mountain tribes on the Pacific coast.  Fort Larned I\r\nfound too near the camps for my purpose, its proximity too readily\r\ninviting unnecessary \"talks,\" so I remained here but a day or two,\r\nand then went on to Dodge, which, though considerably farther away\r\nfrom the camps, was yet close enough to enable us to obtain easily\r\ninformation of all that was going on.\r\n\r\nIt took but a few days at Dodge to discover that great discontent\r\nexisted about the Medicine Lodge concessions, to see that the young\r\nmen were chafing and turbulent, and that it would require much tact\r\nand good management on the part of the Indian Bureau to persuade the\r\nfour tribes to go quietly to their reservations, under an agreement\r\nwhich, when entered into, many of them protested had not been fully\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nA few hours after my arrival a delegation of prominent chiefs called\r\non me and proposed a council, where they might discuss their\r\ngrievances, and thus bring to the notice of the Government the\r\nalleged wrongs done them; but this I refused, because Congress had\r\ndelegated to the Peace Commission the whole matter of treating with\r\nthem, and a council might lead only to additional complications.  My\r\nrefusal left them without hope of securing better terms, or of even\r\ndelaying matters longer; so henceforth they were more than ever\r\nreckless and defiant.  Denunciations of the treaty became outspoken,\r\nand as the young braves grew more and more insolent every day, it\r\namounted to conviction that, unless by some means the irritation was\r\nallayed, hostilities would surely be upon us when the buffalo\r\nreturned to their summer feeding-grounds between the Arkansas and the\r\nPlatte.\r\n\r\nThe principal sufferers in this event would be the settlers in middle\r\nand western Kansas, who, entirely ignorant of the dangers hanging\r\nover them, were laboring to build up homes in a new country.  Hence\r\nthe maintenance of peace was much to be desired, if it could be\r\nsecured without too great concessions, and although I would not meet\r\nthe different tribes in a formal council, yet, to ward off from\r\nsettlers as much as possible the horrors of savage warfare, I showed,\r\nby resorting to persuasive methods, my willingness to temporize a\r\ngood deal.  An abundant supply of rations is usually effective to\r\nkeep matters quiet in such cases, so I fed them pretty freely, and\r\nalso endeavored to control them through certain men who, I found,\r\nbecause of former associations, had their confidence.  These men,\r\nemployed as scouts, or interpreters, were Mr. William Comstock, Mr.\r\nAbner S. Grover, and Mr. Richard Parr.  They had lived on the Plains\r\nfor many years with different tribes of Indians, had trapped and\r\nhunted with them, and knew all the principal chiefs and headmen.\r\nThrough such influences, I thought I saw good chances of preserving\r\npeace, and of inducing the discontented to go quietly to their\r\nreservations in the Indian Territory as soon as General Hazen, the\r\nrepresentative of the Peace Commissioners, was ready to conduct them\r\nthere from Fort Larned.\r\n\r\nBefore returning to Leavenworth I put my mediators (as I may call\r\nthem) under charge of an officer of the army, Lieutenant F. W.\r\nBeecher, a very intelligent man, and directed him to send them out to\r\nvisit among the different tribes, in order to explain what was\r\nintended by the treaty of Medicine Lodge, and to make every effort\r\npossible to avert hostilities.  Under these instructions Comstock and\r\nGrover made it their business to go about among the Cheyennes--the\r\nmost warlike tribe of all--then camping about the headwaters of\r\nPawnee and Walnut creeks, and also to the north and west of Fort\r\nWallace, while Parr spent his time principally with the Kiowas and\r\nComanches.\r\n\r\nFrom the different posts--Wallace, Dodge, and Larned Lieutenant\r\nBeecher kept up communication with all three scouts, and through him\r\nI heard from them at least once a week.  Every now and then some\r\ntrouble along the railroad or stage routes would be satisfactorily\r\nadjusted and quiet restored, and matters seemed to be going on very\r\nwell, the warm weather bringing the grass and buffalo in plenty, and\r\nstill no outbreak, nor any act of downright hostility.  So I began to\r\nhope that we should succeed in averting trouble till the favorite war\r\nseason of the Indians was over, but the early days of August rudely\r\nended our fancied tranquility.\r\n\r\nIn July the encampments about Fort Dodge began to break up, each band\r\nor tribe moving off to some new location north of the Arkansas,\r\ninstead of toward its proper reservation to the south of that river.\r\nThen I learned presently that a party of Cheyennes had made a raid on\r\nthe Kaws--a band of friendly Indians living near Council Grove--and\r\nstolen their horses, and also robbed the houses of several white\r\npeople near Council Grove.  This raid was the beginning of the Indian\r\nwar of 1868.  Immediately following it, the Comanches and Kiowas came\r\nto Fort Larned to receive their annuities, expecting to get also the\r\narms and ammunition promised them at Medicine Lodge, but the raid to\r\nCouncil Grove having been reported to the Indian Department, the\r\nissue of arms was suspended till reparation was made.  This action of\r\nthe Department greatly incensed the savages, and the agent's offer of\r\nthe annuities without guns and pistols was insolently refused, the\r\nIndians sulking back to their camps, the young men giving themselves\r\nup to war-dances, and to powwows with \"medicine-men,\" till all hope\r\nof control was gone.\r\n\r\nBrevet Brigadier-General Alfred Sully, an officer of long experience\r\nin Indian matters, who at this time was in command of the District of\r\nthe Arkansas, which embraced Forts Larned and Dodge, having notified\r\nme of these occurrences at Larned, and expressed the opinion that the\r\nIndians were bent on mischief, I directed him there immediately to\r\nact against them.  After he reached Larned, the chances for peace\r\nappeared more favorable.  The Indians came to see him, and protested\r\nthat it was only a few bad young men who had been depredating, and\r\nthat all would be well and the young men held in check if the agent\r\nwould but issue the arms and ammunition.  Believing their promises,\r\nSully thought that the delivery of the arms would solve all the\r\ndifficulties, so on his advice the agent turned them over along with\r\nthe annuities, the Indians this time condescendingly accepting.\r\n\r\nThis issue of arms and ammunition was a fatal mistake; Indian\r\ndiplomacy had overreached Sully's experience, and even while the\r\ndelivery was in progress a party of warriors had already begun a raid\r\nof murder and rapine, which for acts of devilish cruelty perhaps has\r\nno parallel in savage warfare.  The party consisted of about two\r\nhundred Cheyennes and a few Arapahoes, with twenty Sioux who had been\r\nvisiting their friends, the Cheyennes.  As near as could be\r\nascertained, they organized and left their camps along Pawnee Creek\r\nabout the 3d of August.  Traveling northeast, they skirted around\r\nFort Harker, and made their first appearance among the settlers in\r\nthe Saline Valley, about thirty miles north of that post.  Professing\r\nfriendship and asking food at the farm-houses, they saw the\r\nunsuspecting occupants comply by giving all they could spare from\r\ntheir scanty stores.  Knowing the Indian's inordinate fondness for\r\ncoffee, particularly when well sweetened, they even served him this\r\nluxury freely.  With this the demons began their devilish work.\r\nPretending to be indignant because it was served them in tin cups,\r\nthey threw the hot contents into the women's faces, and then, first\r\nmaking prisoners of the men, they, one after another, ravished the\r\nwomen till the victims became insensible.  For some inexplicable\r\nreason the two farmers were neither killed nor carried off, so after\r\nthe red fiends had gone, the unfortunate women were brought in to\r\nFort Harker, their arrival being the first intimation to the military\r\nthat hostilities had actually begun.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Saline, this war-party crossed over to the valley of the\r\nSolomon, a more thickly settled region, and where the people were in\r\nbetter circumstances, their farms having been started two or three\r\nyears before.  Unaware of the hostile character of the raiders, the\r\npeople here received them in the friendliest way, providing food, and\r\neven giving them ammunition, little dreaming of what was impending.\r\nThese kindnesses were requited with murder and pillage, and worse,\r\nfor all the women who fell into their hands were subjected to horrors\r\nindescribable by words.  Here also the first murders were committed,\r\nthirteen men and two women being killed.  Then, after burning five\r\nhouses and stealing all the horses they could find, they turned back\r\ntoward the Saline, carrying away as prisoners two little girls named\r\nBell, who have never been heard of since.\r\n\r\nIt was probably the intention to finish, as they marched back to the\r\nsouth, the devilish work begun on the Saline, but before they reached\r\nthat valley on the return, the victims left there originally had fled\r\nto Fort Harker, as already explained, and Captain Benteen was now\r\nnearing the little settlement with a troop of cavalry, which he had\r\nhurriedly marched from Fort Zarah.  The savages were attacking the\r\nhouse of a Mr. Schermerhorn, where a few of the settlers had\r\ncollected for defense, when Benteen approached.  Hearing the firing,\r\nthe troopers rode toward the sound at a gallop, but when they\r\nappeared in view, coming over the hills, the Indians fled in all\r\ndirections, escaping punishment through their usual tactics of\r\nscattering over the Plains, so as to leave no distinctive trail.\r\n\r\nWhen this frightful raid was taking place, Lieutenant Beecher, with\r\nhis three scouts--Comstock, Grover, and Parr--was on Walnut Creek.\r\nIndefinite rumors about troubles on the Saline and Solomon reaching\r\nhim, he immediately sent Comstock and Grover over to the headwaters\r\nof the Solomon, to the camp of a band of Cheyennes, whose chief was\r\ncalled \"Turkey Leg,\" to see if any of the raiders belonged there; to\r\nlearn the facts, and make explanations, if it was found that the\r\nwhite people had been at fault.  For years this chief had been a\r\nspecial friend of Comstock and Grover.  They had trapped, hunted, and\r\nlived with his band, and from this intimacy they felt confident of\r\nbeing able to get \"Turkey Leg\" to quiet his people, if any of them\r\nwere engaged in the raid; and, at all events, they expected, through\r\nhim and his band, to influence the rest of the Cheyennes.  From the\r\nmoment they arrived in the Indian village, however, the two scouts\r\nmet with a very cold reception.  Neither friendly pipe nor food was\r\noffered them, and before they could recover from their chilling\r\nreception, they were peremptorily ordered out of the village, with\r\nthe intimation that when the Cheyennes were on the war-path the\r\npresence of whites was intolerable.  The scouts were prompt to leave,\r\nof course, and for a few miles were accompanied by an escort of seven\r\nyoung men, who said they were sent with them to protect the two from\r\nharm.  As the party rode along over the prairie, such a depth\r\nof attachment was professed for Comstock and Grover that,\r\nnotwithstanding all the experience of their past lives, they were\r\nthoroughly deceived, and in the midst of a friendly conversation some\r\nof the young warriors fell suddenly to the rear and treacherously\r\nfired on them.\r\n\r\nAt the volley Comstock fell from his horse instantly killed.  Grover,\r\nbadly wounded in the shoulder, also fell to the ground near Comstock\r\nSeeing his comrade was dead, Grover made use of his friend's body to\r\nprotect himself, lying close behind it.  Then took place a remarkable\r\ncontest, Grover, alone and severely wounded, obstinately fighting the\r\nseven Indians, and holding them at bay for the rest of the day.\r\nBeing an expert shot, and having a long-range repeating rifle, he\r\n\"stood off\" the savages till dark.  Then cautiously crawling away on\r\nhis belly to a deep ravine, he lay close, suffering terribly from his\r\nwound, till the following night, when, setting out for Fort Wallace,\r\nhe arrived there the succeeding day, almost crazed from pain and\r\nexhaustion.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the fiendish atrocities committed on the Saline\r\nand Solomon rivers and the attack on Comstock and Grover, the\r\npillaging and murdering began on the Smoky Hill stage-route, along\r\nthe upper Arkansas River and on the headwaters of the Cimarron.  That\r\nalong the Smoky Hill and north of it was the exclusive work of, the\r\nCheyennes, a part of the Arapahoes, and the few Sioux allies\r\nheretofore mentioned, while the raiding on the Arkansas and Cimarron\r\nwas done principally by the Kiowas under their chief, Satanta, aided\r\nby some of the Comanches.  The young men of these tribes set out on\r\ntheir bloody work just after the annuities and guns were issued at\r\nLarned, and as soon as they were well on the road the rest of the\r\nComanches and Kiowas escaped from the post and fled south of the\r\nArkansas.  They were at once pursued by General Sully with a small\r\nforce, but by the time he reached the Cimarron the war-party had\r\nfinished its raid on the upper Arkansas, and so many Indians combined\r\nagainst Sully that he was compelled to withdraw to Fort Dodge, which\r\nhe reached not without considerable difficulty, and after three\r\nsevere fights.\r\n\r\nThese, and many minor raids which followed, made it plain that a\r\ngeneral outbreak was upon us.  The only remedy, therefore, was to\r\nsubjugate the savages immediately engaged in the forays by forcing\r\nthe several tribes to settle down on the reservations set apart by\r\nthe treaty of Medicine Lodge.  The principal mischief-makers were the\r\nCheyennes.  Next in deviltry were the Kiowas, and then the Arapahoes\r\nand Comanches.  Some few of these last two tribes continued friendly,\r\nor at least took no active part in the raiding, but nearly all the\r\nyoung men of both were the constant allies of the Cheyennes and\r\nKiowas.  All four tribes together could put on the war-path a\r\nformidable force of about 6,000 warriors.  The subjugation of this\r\nnumber of savages would be no easy task, so to give the matter my\r\nundivided attention I transferred my headquarters from Leavenworth to\r\nFort Hays, a military post near which the prosperous town of Hays\r\nCity now stands.\r\n\r\nFort Hays was just beyond the line of the most advanced settlements,\r\nand was then the terminus of the Kansas-Pacific railroad.  For this\r\nreason it could be made a depot of supplies, and was a good point\r\nfrom which to supervise matters in the section of country to be\r\noperated in, which district is a part of the Great American Plains,\r\nextending south from the Platte River in Nebraska to the Red River in\r\nthe Indian Territory, and westward from the line of frontier\r\nsettlements to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, a vast region\r\nembracing an area of about 150,000 square miles.  With the exception\r\nof a half-dozen military posts and a few stations on the two overland\r\nemigrant routes--the Smoky Hill to Denver, and the Arkansas to New\r\nMexico--this country was an unsettled waste known only to the Indians\r\nand a few trappers.  There were neither roads nor well-marked trails,\r\nand the only timber to be found--which generally grew only along the\r\nstreams--was so scraggy and worthless as hardly to deserve the name.\r\nNor was water by any means plentiful, even though the section is\r\ntraversed by important streams, the Republican, the Smoky Hill, the\r\nArkansas, the Cimarron, and the Canadian all flowing eastwardly, as\r\ndo also their tributaries in the main.  These feeders are sometimes\r\nlong and crooked, but as a general thing the volume of water is\r\ninsignificant except after rain-falls.  Then, because of unimpeded\r\ndrainage, the little streams fill up rapidly with torrents of water,\r\nwhich quickly flows off or sinks into the sand, leaving only an\r\noccasional pool without visible inlet or outlet.\r\n\r\nAt the period of which I write, in 1868, the Plains were covered with\r\nvast herds of buffalo--the number has been estimated at 3,000,000\r\nhead--and with such means of subsistence as this everywhere at hand,\r\nthe 6,000 hostiles were wholly unhampered by any problem of\r\nfood-supply.  The savages were rich too according to Indian standards,\r\nmany a lodge owning from twenty to a hundred ponies; and\r\nconsciousness of wealth and power, aided by former temporizing, had\r\nmade them not only confident but defiant.  Realizing that their\r\nthorough subjugation would be a difficult task, I made up my mind to\r\nconfine operations during the grazing and hunting season to\r\nprotecting the people of the new settlements and on the overland\r\nroutes, and then, when winter came, to fall upon the savages\r\nrelentlessly, for in that season their ponies would be thin, and weak\r\nfrom lack of food, and in the cold and snow, without strong ponies to\r\ntransport their villages and plunder, their movements would be so\r\nmuch impeded that the troops could overtake them.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of hostilities I had in all, east of New Mexico, a\r\nforce of regulars numbering about 2,600 men--1,200 mounted and 1,400\r\nfoot troops.  The cavalry was composed of the Seventh and Tenth\r\nregiments; the infantry, of the Third and Fifth regiments and four\r\ncompanies of the Thirty-Eighth.  With these few troops all the posts\r\nalong the Smoky Hill and Arkansas had to be garrisoned, emigrant\r\ntrains escorted, and the settlements and routes of travel and the\r\nconstruction parties on the Kansas-Pacific railway protected.  Then,\r\ntoo, this same force had to furnish for the field small movable\r\ncolumns, that were always on the go, so it will be rightly inferred\r\nthat every available man was kept busy from the middle of August till\r\nNovember; especially as during this period the hostiles attacked over\r\nforty widely dispersed places, in nearly all cases stealing horses,\r\nburning houses, and killing settlers.  It was of course impossible to\r\nforesee where these descents would be made, but as soon as an attack\r\nwas heard of assistance was always promptly rendered, and every now\r\nand then we succeeded in killing a few savages.  As a general thing,\r\nthough, the raiders escaped before relief arrived, and when they had\r\na few miles the start, all efforts to catch them were futile.  I\r\ntherefore discouraged long pursuits, and, in fact, did not approve of\r\nmaking any at all unless the chances of obtaining paying results were\r\nvery evident, otherwise the troops would be worn out by the time the\r\nhard work of the winter was demanded from them.\r\n\r\nTo get ready for a winter campaign of six months gave us much to do.\r\nThe thing most needed was more men, so I asked for additional\r\ncavalry, and all that could be spareds--even troops of the Fifth\r\nCavalry--was sent tome.  Believing this reinforcement insufficient,\r\nto supplement it I applied for a regiment of Kansas volunteers, which\r\nrequest being granted, the organization of the regiment was\r\nimmediately begun at Topeka.  It was necessary also to provide a\r\nlarge amount of transportation and accumulate quantities of stores,\r\nsince the campaign probably would not end till spring.  Another\r\nimportant matter was to secure competent guides for the different\r\ncolumns of troops, for, as I have said, the section of country to be\r\noperated in was comparatively unknown.\r\n\r\nIn those days the railroad town of Hays City was filled with so\r\ncalled \"Indian scouts,\" whose common boast was of having slain scores\r\nof redskins, but the real scout--that is, a 'guide and trailer\r\nknowing the habits of the Indians--was very scarce, and it was hard\r\nto find anybody familiar with the country south of the Arkansas,\r\nwhere the campaign was to be made.  Still, about Hays City and the\r\nvarious military posts there was some good material to select from,\r\nand we managed to employ several men, who, from their experience on\r\nthe Plains in various capacities, or from natural instinct and\r\naptitude, soon became excellent guides and courageous and valuable\r\nscouts, some of them, indeed, gaining much distinction.  Mr. William\r\nF. Cody (\"Buffalo Bill\"), whose renown has since become world-wide,\r\nwas one of the men thus selected.  He received his sobriquet from his\r\nmarked success in killing buffaloes for a contractor, to supply fresh\r\nmeat to the construction parties, on the Kansas-Pacific railway.  He\r\nhad given up this business, however, and was now in the employ of the\r\nquartermaster's department of the army, and was first brought to my\r\nnotice by distinguishing himself in bringing me an important despatch\r\nfrom Fort Larned to Fort Hays, a distance of sixty-five miles,\r\nthrough a section infested with Indians.  The despatch informed me\r\nthat the Indians near Larned were preparing to decamp, and this\r\nintelligence required that certain orders should be carried to Fort\r\nDodge, ninety-five miles south of Hays.  This too being a\r\nparticularly dangerous route--several couriers having been killed on\r\nit--it was impossible to get one of the various \"Petes,\" \"Jacks,\" or\r\n\"Jims\" hanging around Hays City to take my communication.  Cody\r\nlearning of the strait I was in, manfully came to the rescue, and\r\nproposed to make the trip to Dodge, though he had just finished his\r\nlong and perilous ride from Larned.  I gratefully accepted his offer,\r\nand after four or five hours' rest he mounted a fresh horse and\r\nhastened on his journey, halting but once to rest on the way, and\r\nthen only for an hour, the stop being made at Coon Creek, where he\r\ngot another mount from a troop of cavalry.  At Dodge he took six\r\nhours' sleep, and then continued on to his own post--Fort Larned\r\n--with more despatches.  After resting twelve hours at Larned, he was\r\nagain in the saddle with tidings for me at Fort Hays, General Hazen\r\nsending him, this time, with word that the villages had fled to the\r\nsouth of the Arkansas.  Thus, in all, Cody rode about 350 miles in less\r\nthan sixty hours, and such an exhibition of endurance and courage was\r\nmore than enough to convince me that his services would be extremely\r\nvaluable in the campaign, so I retained him at Fort Hays till the\r\nbattalion of the Fifth Cavalry arrived, and then made him chief of\r\nscouts for that regiment.\r\n\r\nThe information brought me by Cody on his second trip from Larned\r\nindicated where the villages would be found in the winter, and I\r\ndecided to move on them about the 1st of November.  Only the women\r\nand children and the decrepit old men were with the villages, however\r\nenough, presumably, to look after the plunder most of the warriors\r\nremaining north of the Arkansas to continue their marauding.  Many\r\nsevere fights occurred between our troops and these marauders, and in\r\nthese affairs, before November 1 over a hundred Indians were killed,\r\nyet from the ease with which the escaping savages would disappear\r\nonly to fall upon remote settlements with pillage and murder, the\r\nresults were by no means satisfactory.  One of the most noteworthy of\r\nthese preliminary affairs was the gallant fight made on the\r\nRepublican River the 17th of September by my Aide, Colonel George A.\r\nForsyth, and party, against about seven hundred Cheyennes and Sioux.\r\nForsyth, with Lieutenant Beecher, and Doctor J. H. Mooers as surgeon,\r\nwas in charge of a company of citizen scouts, mostly expert\r\nrifle-shots, but embracing also a few Indian fighters, among these\r\nGrover and Parr.  The company was organized the latter part of August\r\nfor immediate work in defense of the settlements, and also for future\r\nuse in the Indian Territory when the campaign should open there.  About\r\nthe time the company had reached its complement--it was limited to\r\nforty-seven men and three officers--a small band of hostiles began\r\ndepredations near Sheridan City, one of the towns that grew up\r\nover-night on the Kansas-Pacific railway.  Forsyth pursued this party,\r\nbut failing to overtake it, made his way into Fort Wallace for rations,\r\nintending to return from there to Fort Hays.  Before he started back,\r\nhowever, another band of Indians appeared near the post and stole some\r\nhorses from the stage company.  This unexpected raid made Forsyth hot\r\nto go for the marauders, and he telegraphed me for permission, which I\r\nas promptly gave him.  He left the post on the 10th of September, the\r\ncommand consisting of himself, Lieutenant Beecher, Acting Assistant\r\nSurgeon Mooers, and the full strength, forty-seven men, with a few pack\r\nmules carrying about ten days' rations.\r\n\r\nHe headed north toward the Republican River.  For the first two days\r\nthe trail was indistinct and hard to follow.  During the next three\r\nit continued to grow much larger, indicating plainly that the number\r\nof Indians ahead was rapidly increasing.  Of course this sign meant a\r\nfight as soon as a large enough force was mustered, but as this was\r\nwhat Forsyth was after, he pushed ahead with confidence and alacrity.\r\nThe night of the 16th of September he encamped on the Arickaree\r\nbranch of the Republican, not far from the forks of the river, with\r\nthe expectation of resuming the march as usual next day, for the\r\nindications were that the main body of the savages must be still a\r\nlong way off, though in the preceding twenty-four hours an occasional\r\nIndian had been seen.\r\n\r\nBut the enemy was much nearer than was thought, for at daybreak on\r\nthe morning of the 17th he made known his immediate presence by a\r\nsudden dash at Forsyth's horses, a few of which were stampeded and\r\ncaptured before the scouts could reach them.  This dash was made by a\r\nsmall party only to get the horses, so those engaged in it were soon\r\ndriven off, but a few minutes later hundreds of savages--it was\r\nafterward learned that seven hundred warriors took part in the fight\r\n--hitherto invisible, showed themselves on the hills overlooking the\r\ncamp and so menacingly as to convince Forsyth that his defense must\r\nbe one of desperation.  The only place at hand that gave any hope of\r\nsuccessful resistance was a small island in the Arickaree, the\r\nchannel on one side being about a foot deep while on the other it was\r\ncompletely dry; so to this position a hurried retreat was made.  All\r\nthe men and the remaining animals reached the island in safety, but\r\non account of the heavy fire poured in from the neighboring hills the\r\npacks containing the rations and medicines had to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nOn seeing Forsyth's hasty move, the Indians, thinking they had him,\r\nprepared to overwhelm the scouts by swooping down on one side of the\r\nisland with about five hundred mounted warriors, while about two\r\nhundred, covered by the tall grass in the river-bottom attacked the\r\nother side, dismounted.  But the brave little band sadly disappointed\r\nthem.  When the charge came it was met with such a deadly fire that a\r\nlarge number of the fiends were killed, some of them even after\r\ngaining the bank of the island.  This check had the effect of making\r\nthe savages more wary, but they were still bold enough to make two\r\nmore assaults before mid-day.  Each of these ending like the first,\r\nthe Indians thereafter contented themselves with shooting\r\nall the horses, which had been tied up to some scraggy little\r\ncottonwood-trees, and then proceeded to lay siege to the party.\r\n\r\nThe first man struck was Forsyth himself.  He was hit three times in\r\nall--twice in one leg, both serious wounds, and once on the head, a\r\nslight abrasion of the scalp.  A moment later Beecher was killed and\r\nDoctor Mooers mortally wounded: and in addition to these misfortunes\r\nthe scouts kept getting hit, till several were killed, and the whole\r\nnumber of casualties had reached twenty-one in a company of\r\nforty-seven.  Yet with all this, and despite the seeming hopelessness\r\nof the situation, the survivors kept up their pluck undiminished, and\r\nduring a lull succeeding the third repulse dug into the loose soil till\r\nthe entire party was pretty well protected by rifle-pits.  Thus covered\r\nthey stood off the Indians for the next three days, although of course\r\ntheir condition became deplorable from lack of food, while those who\r\nwere hurt suffered indescribable agony, since no means were at hand for\r\ndressing their wounds.\r\n\r\nBy the third day the Indians, seeming to despair of destroying the\r\nbeleaguered party before succor might arrive, began to draw off, and\r\non the fourth wholly disappeared.  The men were by this time nearly\r\nfamished for food.  Even now there was nothing to be had except\r\nhorse-meat from the carcasses of the animals killed the first day,\r\nand this, though decidedly unpalatable, not to say disgusting, had to\r\nbe put up with, and so on such unwholesome stuff they managed to live\r\nfor four days longer, at the end of which time they were rescued by a\r\ncolumn of troops under Colonel Bankhead, which had hastened from Fort\r\nWallace in response to calls for help, carried there by two brave\r\nfellows--Stilwell and Truedell--who, volunteering to go for relief,\r\nhad slipped through the Indians, and struck out for that post in the\r\nnight after the first day's fight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII,\r\n\r\nFITTING OUT THE WINTER EXPEDITION--ACCOMPANYING THE MAIN FORCE--THE\r\nOTHER COLUMNS--STRUCK BY A BLIZZARD--CUSTER'S FIGHT ON THE WASHITA\r\n--DEFEAT AND DEATH OF BLACK KETTLE--MASSACRE OF ELLIOTT'S PARTY\r\n--RELIEF OF COLONEL CRAWFORD.\r\n\r\nThe end of October saw completed the most of my arrangements for the\r\nwinter campaign, though the difficulties and hardships to be\r\nencountered had led several experienced officers of the army, and\r\nsome frontiersmen like Mr. James Bridger, the famous scout and, guide\r\nof earlier days, to discourage the project.  Bridger even went so far\r\nas to come out from St. Louis to dissuade me, but I reasoned that as\r\nthe soldier was much better fed and clothed than the Indian, I had\r\none great advantage, and that, in short, a successful campaign could\r\nbe made if the operations of the different columns were energetically\r\nconducted.  To see to this I decided to go in person with the main\r\ncolumn, which was to push down into the western part of the Indian\r\nTerritory, having for its initial objective the villages which, at\r\nthe beginning of hostilities, had fled toward the head-waters of the\r\nRed River, and those also that had gone to the same remote region\r\nafter decamping from the neighborhood of Larned at the time that\r\nGeneral Hazen sent Buffalo Bill to me with the news.\r\n\r\nThe column which was expected to do the main work was to be composed\r\nof the Nineteenth Kansas Volunteer Cavalry, commanded by Colonel\r\nCrawford; eleven troops of the Seventh United States Cavalry, under\r\nGeneral Custer, and a battalion of five companies of infantry under\r\nBrevet Major John H. Page.  To facilitate matters, General Sully, the\r\ndistrict commander, was ordered to rendezvous these troops and\r\nestablish a supply depot about a hundred miles south of Fort Dodge,\r\nas from such a point operations could be more readily conducted.  He\r\nselected for the depot a most suitable place at the confluence of\r\nBeaver and Wolf creeks, and on his arrival there with Custer's and\r\nPage's commands, named the place Camp Supply.\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with the main column, two others also were to\r\npenetrate the Indian Territory.  One of these, which was to march\r\neast from New Mexico by way of Fort Bascom was to be composed of six\r\ntroops of the Third Cavalry and two companies of infantry, the whole\r\nunder Colonel A. W. Evans.  The other, consisting of seven troops of\r\nthe Fifth Cavalry, and commanded by Brevet Brigadier-General Eugene\r\nA. Carr, was to march southeast from Fort Lyon; the intention being\r\nthat Evans and Carr should destroy or drive in toward old Fort Cobb\r\nany straggling bands that might be prowling through the country west\r\nof my own line of march; Carr, as he advanced, to be joined by Brevet\r\nBrigadier-General W. H. Penrose, with five troops of cavalry already\r\nin the field southeast of Lyon.  The Fort Bascom column, after\r\nestablishing a depot of supplies at Monument Creek, was to work down\r\nthe main Canadian, and remain out as long as it could feed itself\r\nfrom New Mexico; Carr, having united with Penrose on the North\r\nCanadian, was to operate toward the Antelope Hills and headwaters of\r\nthe Red River; while I, with the main column was to move southward to\r\nstrike the Indians along the Washita, or still farther south on\r\nbranches of the Red River.\r\n\r\nIt was no small nor easy task to outfit all these troops by the time\r\ncold weather set in, and provide for them during the winter, but by\r\nthe 1st of November I had enough supplies accumulated at Forts Dodge\r\nand Lyon for my own and Carr's columns, and in addition directed\r\nsubsistence and forage for three months to be sent to Fort Gibson for\r\nfinal delivery at Fort Arbuckle, as I expected to feed the command\r\nfrom this place when we arrived in the neighborhood of old Fort Cobb,\r\nbut through some mismanagement few of these stores got further than\r\nGibson before winter came on.\r\n\r\nNovember 1, all being ready, Colonel Grawford was furnished with\r\ncompetent guides, and, after sending two troops to Fort Dodge to act\r\nas my escort, with the rest of his regiment he started from Topeka\r\nNovember 5, under orders to march straight for the rendezvous at the\r\njunction of Beaver and Wolf creeks.  He was expected to reach his\r\ndestination about the 20th, and there unite with the Seventh Cavalry\r\nand the battalion of infantry, which in the mean time were on the\r\nmarch from Dodge.  A few days later Carr and Evans began their march\r\nalso, and everything being now in motion, I decided to go to Camp\r\nSupply to give the campaign my personal attention, determined to\r\nprove that operations could be successfully conducted in spite of\r\nwinter, and bent on showing the Indians that they were not secure\r\nfrom punishment because of inclement weather--an ally on which they\r\nhad hitherto relied with much assurance.\r\n\r\nWe started from Fort Hays on the 15th of November, and the first\r\nnight out a blizzard struck us and carried away our tents; and as the\r\ngale was so violent that they could not be put up again, the rain and\r\nsnow drenched us to the skin.  Shivering from wet and cold, I took\r\nrefuge under a wagon, and there spent such a miserable night that,\r\nwhen at last morning came, the gloomy predictions of old man Bridger\r\nand others rose up before me with greatly increased force.  As we\r\ntook the road the sleet and snow were still falling, but we labored\r\non to Dodge that day in spite of the fact that many of the mules\r\nplayed out on the way.  We stayed only one night at Dodge, and then\r\non the 17th, escorted by a troop of cavalry and Forsyth's scouts, now\r\nunder the command of Lieutenant Lewis Pepoon, crossed the Arkansas\r\nand camped the night of the 18th at Bluff Creek, where the two troops\r\nof the Nineteenth Kansas, previously detailed as my escort, were\r\nawaiting our coming.  As we were approaching this camp some\r\nsuspicious looking objects were seen moving off at a long distance to\r\nthe east of us, but as the scouts confidently pronounced them\r\nbuffalo, we were unaware of their true character till next morning,\r\nwhen we became satisfied that what we had seen were Indians, for\r\nimmediately after crossing Beaver Creek we struck a trail, leading to\r\nthe northeast, of a war party that evidently came up from the\r\nhead-waters of the Washita River.\r\n\r\nThe evening of November 21st arrived at the Camp Supply depot, having\r\ntraveled all day in another snowstorm that did not end till\r\ntwenty-four hours later.  General Sully, with Custer's regiment and the\r\ninfantry battalion, had reached the place several days before, but the\r\nKansas regiment had not yet put in an appearance.  All hands were hard\r\nat work trying to shelter the stores and troops, but from the trail\r\nseen that morning, believing that an opportunity offered to strike an\r\neffective blow, I directed Custer to call in his working parties and\r\nprepare to move immediately, without waiting for Crawford's regiment,\r\nunaccountably absent.  Custer was ready to start by the 23d, and he was\r\nthen instructed to march north to where the trail had been seen near\r\nBeaver Creek and follow it on the back track, for, being convinced that\r\nthe war party had come from the Washita, I felt certain that this plan\r\nwould lead directly to the villages.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties attending a winter campaign were exhibited now with\r\ntheir full force, as the march had to be conducted through a\r\nsnow-storm that hid surrounding objects, and so covered the country as\r\nto alter the appearance of the prominent features, making the task of\r\nthe guides doubly troublesome; but in spite of these obstacles fifteen\r\nmiles had been traversed when Custer encamped for the night. The next\r\nday the storm had ceased, and the weather was clear and cold.  The\r\nheavy fall of snow had of course obliterated the trail in the bottoms,\r\nand everywhere on the level; but, thanks to the wind, that had swept\r\ncomparatively bare the rough places and high ground, the general\r\ndirection could be traced without much trouble.  The day's march, which\r\nwas through a country abounding with buffalo, was unattended by any\r\nspecial incident at first, but during the afternoon, after getting the\r\ncolumn across the Canadian River--an operation which, on account of the\r\nwagons, consumed considerable time--Custer's scouts (friendly Osages)\r\nbrought back word that, some miles ahead, they had struck fresh signs,\r\na trail coming into the old one from the north, which, in their\r\nopinion, indicated that the war party was returning to the villages.\r\n\r\nOn the receipt of this news, Custer, leaving a guard with the wagons,\r\nhastily assembled the rest of his men' and pushing on rapidly,\r\novertook the scouts and a detailed party from his regiment which had\r\naccompanied them, all halted on the new trail awaiting his arrival.\r\nA personal examination satisfied Custer that the surmises of his\r\nscouts were correct; and also that the fresh trail in the deep snow\r\ncould at night be followed with ease.  After a short halt for supper\r\nand rest the pursuit was resumed, the Osage scouts in advance, and\r\nalthough the hostile Indians were presumed to be yet some distance\r\noff, every precaution was taken to prevent detection and to enable\r\nour troops to strike them unawares.  The fresh trail, which it was\r\nafterward ascertained had been made by raiders from Black Kettle's\r\nvillage of Cheyennes, and by some Arapahoes, led into the valley of\r\nthe Washita, and growing fresher as the night wore on, finally\r\nbrought the Osages upon a campfire, still smoldering, which, it was\r\nconcluded, had been built by the Indian boys acting as herders of the\r\nponies during the previous day.  It was evident, then, that the\r\nvillage could be but a few miles off; hence the pursuit was continued\r\nwith redoubled caution until, a few hours before dawn of the 27th, as\r\nthe leading scouts peered over a rise on the line of march, they\r\ndiscovered a large body of animals in the valley below.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they reported this discovery, Custer determined to\r\nacquaint himself with the situation by making a reconnoissance in\r\nperson, accompanied by his principal officers.  So, sending back word\r\nto halt the cavalry, he directed the officers to ride forward with\r\nhim; then dismounting, the entire party crept cautiously to a high\r\npoint which overlooked the valley, and from where, by the bright moon\r\nthen shining, they saw just how the village was situated. Its\r\nposition was such as to admit of easy approach from all sides.  So,\r\nto preclude an escape of the Indians, Custer decided to attack at\r\ndaybreak, and from four different directions.\r\n\r\nThe plan having been fully explained to the officers, the remaining\r\nhours of the night were employed in making the necessary\r\ndispositions.  Two of the detachments left promptly, since they had\r\nto make a circuitous march of several miles to Teach the points\r\ndesignated for their attack; the third started a little later; and\r\nthen the fourth and last, under Custer himself, also moved into\r\nposition.  As the first light grew visible in the east, each column\r\nmoved closer in to the village, and then, all dispositions having\r\nbeen made according to the prearranged plan, from their appointed\r\nplaces the entire force to the opening notes of \"Garry Owen,\" played\r\nby the regimental band as the signal for the attack--dashed at a\r\ngallop into the village.  The sleeping and unsuspecting savages were\r\ncompletely surprised by the onset; yet after the first confusion,\r\nduring which the impulse to escape principally actuated them, they\r\nseized their weapons, and from behind logs and trees, or plunging\r\ninto the stream and using its steep bank as a breastwork, they poured\r\nupon their assailants a heavy fire, and kept on fighting with every\r\nexhibition of desperation.  In such a combat mounted men were\r\nuseless, so Custer directed his troopers to fight on, foot, and the\r\nIndians were successively driven from one point of vantage to\r\nanother, until, finally, by 9 o'clock the entire camp was in his\r\npossession and the victory complete.  Black Kettle and over one\r\nhundred of his warriors were killed, and about fifty women and\r\nchildren captured; but most of the noncombatants, as well as a few\r\nwarriors and boys, escaped in the confusion of the fight.  Making\r\ntheir way down the river, these fugitives alarmed the rest of the\r\nCheyennes and Arapahoes, and also the Kiowas and Comanches, whose\r\nvillages were in close proximity--the nearest not more than two miles\r\noff.\r\n\r\nThen of course all the warriors of these tribes rallied to attack\r\nCuster, who meantime was engaged burning Black Kettle's camp and\r\ncollecting his herds of ponies.  But these new foes were rather wary\r\nand circumspect, though they already had partial revenge in an\r\nunlooked for way by cutting off Major Elliott and fifteen men, who\r\nhad gone off in pursuit of a batch of young warriors when the fight\r\nwas going on at the village.  In fact, the Indians had killed\r\nElliott's whole party, though neither the fate of the poor fellows,\r\nnor how they happened to be caught, was known till long afterward.\r\nIt was then ascertained that the detachment pursued a course due\r\nsouth, nearly at right angles to the Washita River, and after\r\ngalloping a couple of miles over the hills, crossing a small branch\r\nof the Washita on the way, they captured some of the fugitives.  In\r\nbringing the prisoners back, Elliott was in turn attacked on the open\r\nprairie by a large number of savages from farther down the Washita,\r\nwho by this time were swarming to the aid of Black Kettle's village.\r\nThe little band fought its way gallantly to within rifle-range of the\r\nsmall creek referred to, but could get no farther, for the Indians\r\nhad taken up a position in the bed of the stream, and from under\r\ncover of its banks Elliott and all his remaining men were quickly\r\nkilled.  No relief was sent them, for Custer, not having seen Elliott\r\nset out, knew nothing of the direction taken, and, besides, was busy\r\nburning the villages and securing the ponies, and deeply concerned,\r\ntoo, with defending himself from the new dangers menacing him.\r\nElliott and his brave little party were thus left to meet their fate\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nWhile Custer was burning the lodges and plunder and securing the\r\nponies, the Indians from the villages down the Washita were gathering\r\nconstantly around him till by mid-day they had collected in\r\nthousands, and then came a new problem as to what should be done.  If\r\nhe attacked the other villages, there was great danger of his being\r\noverwhelmed, and should he start back to Camp Supply by daylight, he\r\nwould run the risk of losing his prisoners and the ponies, so,\r\nthinking the matter over, he decided to shoot all the ponies, and\r\nkeep skirmishing with the savages till nightfall, and then, under\r\ncover of the darkness, return to Camp Supply; a programme that was\r\ncarried out successfully, but Custer's course received some severe\r\ncriticism because no effort was made to discover what had become of\r\nElliott.\r\n\r\nCuster had, in all, two officers and nineteen men killed, and two\r\nofficers and eleven men wounded.  The blow struck was a most\r\neffective one, and, fortunately, fell on one of the most villainous of\r\nthe hostile bands that, without any provocation whatever, had\r\nperpetrated the massacres on the Saline and Solomon, committing\r\natrocities too repulsive for recital, and whose hands were still red\r\nfrom their bloody work on the recent raid.  Black Kettle, the chief,\r\nwas an old man, and did not himself go with the raiders to the Saline\r\nand Solomon, and on this account his fate was regretted by some.  But\r\nit was old age only that kept him back, for before the demons set out\r\nfrom Walnut Creek he had freely encouraged them by \"making medicine,\"\r\nand by other devilish incantations that are gone through with at war\r\nand scalp dances.\r\n\r\nWhen the horrible work was over he undertook to shield himself by\r\nprofessions of friendship, but being put to the test by my offering\r\nto feed and care for all of his band who would come in to Fort Dodge\r\nand remain there peaceably, he defiantly refused.  The consequence of\r\nthis refusal was a merited punishment, only too long delayed.\r\n\r\nI received the first news of Custer's fight on the Washita on the\r\nmorning of November 29.  It was brought to me by one of his white\r\nscouts, \"California Joe,\" a noted character, who had been\r\nexperiencing the ups and downs of pioneer life ever since crossing\r\nthe Plains in 1849.  Joe was an invaluable guide and Indian fighter\r\nwhenever the clause of the statute prohibiting liquors in the Indian\r\ncountry happened to be in full force.  At the time in question the\r\nrestriction was by no means a dead letter, and Joe came through in\r\nthirty-six hours, though obliged to keep in hiding during daylight of\r\nthe 28th.  The tidings brought were joyfully received by everybody at\r\nCamp Supply, and they were particularly agreeable tome, for, besides\r\nbeing greatly worried about the safety of the command in the extreme\r\ncold and deep snows, I knew that the immediate effect a victory would\r\nbe to demoralize the rest of the hostiles, which of course would\r\ngreatly facilitate and expedite our ultimate success.  Toward evening\r\nthe day after Joe arrived the head of Custer's column made its\r\nappearance on the distant hills, the friendly Osage scouts and the\r\nIndian prisoners in advance.  As they drew near, the scouts began a\r\nwild and picturesque performance in celebration of the victory,\r\nyelling, firing their guns, throwing themselves on the necks and\r\nsides of their horses to exhibit their skill in riding, and going\r\nthrough all sorts of barbaric evolutions and gyrations, which were\r\ncontinued till night, when the rejoicings were ended with the hideous\r\nscalp dance.\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of Major Elliott and his party was the only damper\r\nupon our pleasure, and the only drawback to the very successful\r\nexpedition.  There was no definite information as to the detachment,\r\n--and Custer was able to report nothing more than that he had not\r\nseen Elliott since just before the fight began.  His theory was,\r\nhowever, that Elliott and his men had strayed off on account of\r\nhaving no guide, and would ultimately come in all right to Camp\r\nSupply or make their way back to Fort Dodge; a very unsatisfactory\r\nview of the matter, but as no one knew the direction Elliott had\r\ntaken, it was useless to speculate on other suppositions, and\r\naltogether too late to make any search for him.  I was now anxious to\r\nfollow up Custer's stroke by an immediate move to the south with the\r\nentire column, but the Kansas regiment had not yet arrived.  At first\r\nits nonappearance did not worry me much, for I attributed the delay\r\nto the bad weather, and supposed Colonel Crawford had wisely laid up\r\nduring the worst storms.  Further, waiting, however, would give the\r\nIndians a chance to recover from the recent dispiriting defeat, so I\r\nsent out scouting parties to look Crawford up and hurry him along.\r\nAfter a great deal of searching, a small detachment of the regiment\r\nwas found about fifty miles below us on the North Canadian, seeking\r\nour camp.  This detachment was in a pretty bad plight, and when\r\nbrought in, the officer in charge reported that the regiment, by not\r\nfollowing the advice of the guide sent to conduct it to Camp Supply,\r\nhad lost its way.  Instead of relying on the guides, Crawford had\r\nundertaken to strike through the canyons of the Cimarron by what\r\nappeared to him a more direct route, and in the deep gorges, filled\r\nas they were with snow, he had been floundering about for days\r\nwithout being able to extricate his command.  Then, too, the men were\r\nout of rations, though they had been able to obtain enough buffalo\r\nmeat to keep from starving.  As for the horses, since they could get\r\nno grass, about seven hundred of them had already perished from\r\nstarvation and exposure.  Provisions and guides were immediately sent\r\nout to the regiment, but before the relief could reach Crawford his\r\nremaining horses were pretty much all gone, though the men were\r\nbrought in without loss of life.  Thus, the regiment being dismounted\r\nby this misfortune at the threshold of the campaign, an important\r\nfactor of my cavalry was lost to me, though as foot-troops the Kansas\r\nvolunteers continued to render very valuable services till mustered\r\nout the next spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nA WINTER EXPEDITION--HERDS OF BUFFALO--WOLVES--BLIZZARDS--A TERRIBLE\r\nNIGHT--FINDING THE BODIES OF ELLIOTT'S PARTY--THE ABANDONED INDIAN\r\nCAMPS--PUSHING DOWN THE WASHITA--THE CAPTURED CHIEFS--EVANS'S\r\nSUCCESSFUL FIGHT--ESTABLISHING FORT SILL--\"CALIFORNIA JOE\"--DUPLICITY\r\nOF THE CHEYENNES--ORDERED TO REPAIR TO WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nA few days were necessarily lost setting up and refitting the Kansas\r\nregiment after its rude experience in the Cimarron canyons.  This\r\nthrough with, the expedition, supplied with thirty days' rations,\r\nmoved out to the south on the 7th of December, under my personal\r\ncommand.  We headed for the Witchita Mountains, toward which rough\r\nregion all the villages along the Washita River had fled after\r\nCuster's fight with Black Kettle.  My line of march was by way of\r\nCuster's battle-field, and thence down the Washita, and if the\r\nIndians could not sooner be brought to terms, I intended to follow\r\nthem into the Witchita Mountains from near old Fort Cobb.  The snow\r\nwas still deep everywhere, and when we started the thermometer was\r\nbelow zero, but the sky being clear and the day very bright, the\r\ncommand was in excellent spirits.  The column was made up of ten\r\ncompanies of the Kansas regiment, dismounted; eleven companies of the\r\nSeventh Cavalry, Pepoon's scouts, and the Osage scouts.  In addition\r\nto Pepoon's men and the Osages, there was also \"California Joe,\" and\r\none or two other frontiersmen besides, to act as guides and\r\ninterpreters.  Of all these the principal one, the one who best knew\r\nthe country, was Ben Clark, a young man who had lived with the\r\nCheyennes during much of his boyhood, and who not only had a pretty\r\ngood knowledge of the country, but also spoke fluently the Cheyenne\r\nand Arapahoe dialects, and was an adept in the sign language.\r\n\r\nThe first day we made only about ten miles, which carried us to the\r\nsouth bank of Wolf Creek.  A considerable part of the day was devoted\r\nto straightening out matters in the command, and allowing time for\r\nequalizing the wagon loads, which as a general thing, on a first\r\nday's march, are unfairly distributed.  And then there was an\r\nabundance of fire-wood at Wolf Creek; indeed, here and on Hackberry\r\nCreek--where I intended to make my next camp--was the only timber\r\nnorth of the Canadian River; and to select the halting places near a\r\nplentiful supply of wood was almost indispensable, for as the men\r\nwere provided with only shelter-tents, good fires were needed in\r\norder to keep warm.\r\n\r\nThe second day, after marching for hours through vast herds of\r\nbuffalo, we made Hackberry Creek; but not, however, without several\r\nstampedes in the wagon-train, the buffalo frightening the mules so\r\nthat it became necessary to throw out flankers to shoot the leading\r\nbulls and thus turn off the herds.  In the wake of every drove\r\ninvariably followed a band of wolves.  This animal is a great coward\r\nusually, but hunger had made these so ravenous that they would come\r\nboldly up to the column, and as quick as a buffalo was killed, or\r\neven disabled, they would fall upon the carcass and eagerly devour\r\nit.  Antelope also were very numerous, and as they were quite tame\r\n--being seldom chased--and naturally very inquisitive, it was not an\r\nunfrequent thing to see one of the graceful little creatures run in\r\namong the men and be made a prisoner.  Such abundance of game\r\nrelieved the monotony of the march to Hackberry Creek, but still,\r\nboth men and animals were considerably exhausted by their long tramp,\r\nfor we made over thirty miles that day.\r\n\r\nWe camped in excellent shape on the creek and it was well we did, for\r\na \"Norther,\" or \"blizzard,\" as storms on the Plains are now termed\r\nstruck us in the night.  During the continuance of these blizzards,\r\nwhich is usually about three days, the cold wind sweeps over the\r\nPlains with great force, and, in the latitude of the Indian\r\nTerritory, is weighted with great quantities of sleet and snow,\r\nthrough which it is often impossible to travel; indeed, these\r\n\"Northers\" have many times proved fatal to the unprotected\r\nfrontiersman.  With our numbers the chance of any one's being lost,\r\nand perishing alone (one of the most common dangers in a blizzard),\r\nwas avoided; but under any circumstances such a storm could but\r\noccasion intense suffering to all exposed to it, hence it would have\r\nbeen well to remain in camp till the gale was over, but the time\r\ncould not be spared.  We therefore resumed the march at an early hour\r\nnext morning, with the expectation of making the south bank of the\r\nmain Canathan and there passing the night, as Clark assured me that\r\ntimber was plentiful on that side of the river.  The storm greatly\r\nimpeded us, however, many of the mules growing discouraged, and some\r\ngiving out entirely, so we could not get to Clark's \"good camp,\" for\r\nwith ten hours of utmost effort only about half a day's distance\r\ncould be covered, when at last, finding the struggle useless, we were\r\nforced to halt for the night in a bleak bottom on the north bank of\r\nthe river.  But no one could sleep, for the wind swept over us with\r\nunobstructed fury, and the only fuel to be had was a few green\r\nbushes.  As night fell a decided change of temperature added much to\r\nour misery, the mercury, which had risen when the \"Norther\" began,\r\nagain falling to zero.  It can be easily imagined that under such\r\ncircumstances the condition of the men was one of extreme discomfort;\r\nin truth, they had to tramp up and down the camp all night long to\r\nkeep from freezing.  Anything was a relief to this state of things,\r\nso at the first streak of day we quit the dreadful place and took up\r\nthe march.\r\n\r\nA seemingly good point for crossing the Canadian was found a couple\r\nof miles down the stream, where we hoped to get our train over on the\r\nice, but an experiment proving that it was not strong enough, a ford\r\nhad to be made, which was done by marching some of the cavalry\r\nthrough the river, which was about half a mile wide, to break up the\r\nlarge floes when they had been cut loose with axes.  After much hard\r\nwork a passage-way was thus opened, and by noon the command was\r\ncrossed to the south bank, and after thawing out and drying our\r\nclothes before big fires, we headed for a point on the Washita, where\r\nClark said there was plenty of wood, and good water too, to make us\r\ncomfortable till the blizzard had blown over.\r\n\r\nWe reached the valley of the Washita a little before dark, and camped\r\nsome five or six miles above the scene of Custer's fight, where I\r\nconcluded to remain at least a day, to rest the command and give it a\r\nchance to refit.  In the mean time I visited the battle-field in\r\ncompany with Custer and several other officers, to see if there was a\r\npossibility of discovering any traces of Elliotts party.  On arriving\r\nat the site of the village, and learning from Custer what\r\ndispositions had been made in approaching for the attack, the\r\nsquadron of the escort was deployed and pushed across the river at\r\nthe point where Elliott had crossed.  Moving directly to the south,\r\nwe had not gone far before we struck his trail, and soon the whole\r\nstory was made plain by our finding, on an open level space about two\r\nmiles from the destroyed village, the dead and frozen bodies of the\r\nentire party.  The poor fellows were all lying within a circle not\r\nmore than fifteen or twenty paces in diameter, and the little piles\r\nof empty cartridge shells near each body showed plainly that every\r\nman had made a brave fight.  None were scalped, but most of them were\r\notherwise horribly mutilated, which fiendish work is usually done by\r\nthe squaws.  All had been stripped of their clothing, but their\r\ncomrades in the escort were able to identify the bodies, which being\r\ndone, we gave them decent burial.  Their fate was one that has\r\novertaken many of our gallant army in their efforts to protect the\r\nfrontiersmen's homes and families from savages who give no quarter,\r\nthough they have often received it, and where the possibility of\r\ndefeat in action carries with it the certainty of death and often of\r\npreceding torture.\r\n\r\nFrom the meadow where Elliott was found we rode to the Washita, and\r\nthen down the river through the sites of the abandoned villages, that\r\nhad been strung along almost continuously for about twelve miles in\r\nthe timber skirting the stream.  On every hand appeared ample\r\nevidence that the Indians had intended to spend the winter here, for\r\nthe ground was littered with jerked meat, bales of buffalo robes,\r\ncooking utensils, and all sorts of plunder usually accumulated in a\r\npermanent Indian camp.  There were, also, lying dead near the\r\nvillages hundreds of ponies, that had been shot to keep them from\r\nfalling into our hands, the scant grazing and extreme cold having\r\nmade them too weak to be driven along in the flight.  The wholesale\r\nslaughter of these ponies was a most cheering indication that our\r\ncampaign would be ultimately successful, and we all prayed for at\r\nleast a couple of months more of cold weather and plenty of snow.\r\n\r\nAt the Kiowa village we found the body of a white woman--a Mrs.\r\nBlynn--and also that of her child.  These captives had been taken by\r\nthe Kiowas near Fort Lyon the previous summer, and kept close\r\nprisoners until the stampede began, the poor woman being reserved to\r\ngratify the brutal lust of the chief, Satanta; then, however, Indian\r\nvengeance demanded the murder of the poor creatures, and after\r\nbraining the little child against a tree, the mother was shot through\r\nthe forehead, the weapon, which no doubt brought her welcome release,\r\nhaving been fired so close that the powder had horribly disfigured\r\nher face.  The two bodies were wrapped in blankets and taken to camp,\r\nand afterward carried along in our march, till finally they were\r\ndecently interred at Fort Arbuckle..\r\n\r\nAt an early hour on December 12 the command pulled out from its cosy\r\ncamp and pushed down the valley of the Washita, following immediately\r\non the Indian trail which led in the direction of Fort Cobb, but\r\nbefore going far it was found that the many deep ravines and canyons\r\non this trail would delay our train very much, so we moved out of the\r\nvalley and took the level prairie on the divide.  Here the traveling\r\nwas good, and a rapid gait was kept up till mid-day, when, another\r\nstorm of sleet and snow coming on, it became extremely difficult for\r\nthe guides to make out the proper course; and fearing that we might\r\nget lost or caught on the open plain without wood or water--as we had\r\nbeen on the Canadian--I turned the command back to the valley,\r\nresolved to try no more shortcuts involving the risk of a disaster to\r\nthe expedition.  But to get back was no slight task, for a dense fog\r\njust now enveloped us, obscuring all landmarks.  However, we were\r\nheaded right when the fog set in, and we had the good luck to reach\r\nthe valley before night-fall, though there was a great deal of\r\nfloundering about, and also much disputing among the guides as to\r\nwhere the river would be found Fortunately we struck the stream right\r\nat a large grove of timber, and established ourselves, admirably.  By\r\ndark the ground was covered with twelve or fifteen inches of fresh\r\nsnow, and as usual the temperature rose very sensibly while the storm\r\nwas on, but after night-fall the snow ceased and the skies cleared\r\nup.  Daylight having brought zero weather again, our start on the\r\nmorning of the 17th was painful work, many of the men freezing their\r\nfingers while handling the horse equipments, harness, and tents.\r\nHowever, we got off in fairly good season, and kept to the trail\r\nalong the Washita notwithstanding the frequent digging and bridging\r\nnecessary to get the wagons over ravines.\r\n\r\nContinuing on this line for three days, we at length came to a point\r\non the Washita where all signs indicated that we were nearing some of\r\nthe villages.  Wishing to strike them as soon as possible, we made a\r\nvery early start next morning, the 17th.  A march of four or five\r\nmiles brought us to a difficult ravine, and while we were making\r\npreparations to get over, word was brought that several Indians had\r\nappeared in our front bearing a white flag and making signs that they\r\nhad a communication to deliver.  We signaled back that they would be\r\nreceived, when one of the party came forward alone and delivered a\r\nletter, which proved to be from General Hazen, at Fort Cobb.  The\r\nletter showed that Hazen was carrying on negotiations with the\r\nIndians, and stated that all the tribes between Fort Cobb and my\r\ncolumn were friendly, but the intimation was given that the\r\nCheyennes and Arapahoes were still hostile, having moved off\r\nsouthward toward the Red River.  It was added that Satanta and Lone\r\nWolf--the chiefs of the Kiowas--would give information of the\r\nwhereabouts of the hostiles; and such a communication coming direct\r\nfrom the representative of the Indian Department, practically took\r\nthe Kiowas--the village at hand was of that tribe--under its\r\nprotection, and also the Comanches, who were nearer in to Cobb.  Of\r\ncourse, under such circumstances I was compelled to give up the\r\nintended attack, though I afterward regretted that I had paid any\r\nheed to the message, because Satanta and Lone Wolf proved, by\r\ntrickery and double dealing, that they had deceived Hazen into\r\nwriting the letter.\r\n\r\nWhen I informed the Klowas that I would respect Hazen's letter\r\nprovided they all came into Fort Cobb and gave themselves up, the two\r\nchiefs promised submission, and, as an evidence of good faith,\r\nproposed to accompany the column to Fort Cobb with a large body of\r\nwarriors, while their villages moved to the same point by easy\r\nstages, along the opposite bank of the river--claiming this to be\r\nnecessary from the poor condition of the ponies.  I had some\r\nmisgivings as to the sincerity of Satanta and Lone Wolf, but as I\r\nwanted to get the Kiowas where their surrender would be complete, so\r\nthat the Cheyennes and Arapahoes could then be pursued, I agreed to\r\nthe proposition, and the column moved on.  All went well that day,\r\nbut the next it was noticed that the warriors were diminishing, and\r\nan investigation showed that a number of them had gone off on various\r\npretexts--the main one being to help along the women and children\r\nwith the villages.  With this I suspected that they were playing me\r\nfalse, and my suspicions grew into certainty when Satanta himself\r\ntried to make his escape by slipping beyond the flank of the column\r\nand putting spurs to his pony.  Fortunately, several officers saw\r\nhim, and quickly giving chase, overhauled him within a few hundred\r\nyards.  I then arrested both him and Lone Wolf and held them as\r\nhostages--a measure that had the effect of bringing back many of the\r\nwarriors already beyond our reach.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at Fort Cobb we found some of the Comanches already\r\nthere, and soon after the rest of them, excepting one band, came in\r\nto the post.  The Kiowas, however, were not on hand, and there were\r\nno signs to indicate their coming.  At the end of two days it was\r\nplain enough that they were acting in bad faith, and would continue\r\nto unless strong pressure was brought to bear.  Indeed, they had\r\nalready started for the Witchita Mountains, so I put on the screws at\r\nonce by issuing an order to hang Satanta and Lone Wolf, if their\r\npeople did not surrender at Fort Cobb within forty-eight hours.  The\r\ntwo chiefs promised prompt compliance, but begged for more time,\r\nseeking to explain the non-arrival of the women and children through\r\nthe weak condition of the ponies; but I was tired of their duplicity,\r\nand insisted on my ultimatum.\r\n\r\nThe order for the execution brought quick fruit.  Runners were sent\r\nout with messages, by the two prisoners, appealing to their people to\r\nsave the lives of their chiefs, and the result was that the whole\r\ntribe came in to the post within the specified time.  The two\r\nmanacled wretches thus saved their necks; but it is to be regretted\r\nthat the execution did not come off; for some years afterward their\r\ndevilish propensities led them into Texas, where both engaged in the\r\nmost horrible butcheries.\r\n\r\nThe Kiowas were now in our hands, and all the Comanches too, except\r\none small band, which, after the Custer fight, had fled toward the\r\nheadwaters of the Red River.  This party was made up of a lot of very\r\nbad Indians--outlaws from the main tribe--and we did not hope to\r\nsubdue them except by a fight, and of this they got their fill; for\r\nEvans, moving from Monument Creek toward the western base of the\r\nWitchita Mountains on Christmas Day, had the good fortune to strike\r\ntheir village.  In the snow and cold his approach was wholly\r\nunexpected, and he was thus enabled to deal the band a blow that\r\npractically annihilated it.  Twenty-five warriors were killed\r\noutright, most of the women and children captured, and all the\r\nproperty was destroyed.  Only a few of the party escaped, and some of\r\nthese made their way in to Fort Cobb, to join the rest of their tribe\r\nin confinement; while others, later in the season, surrendered at\r\nFort Bascom.\r\n\r\nThis sudden appearance of Evans in the Red River region also alarmed\r\nthe Cheyennes and Arapahoes, and their thoughts now began to turn to\r\nsubmission.  Food was growing scarce with them, too, as there was but\r\nlittle game to be found either in the Witchita Mountains or on the\r\nedge of the Staked Plains, and the march of Carr's column from\r\nAntelope Hills precluded their returning to where the buffalo ranged.\r\nThen, too, many of their ponies were dead or dying, most of their\r\ntepees and robes had been abandoned, and the women and children,\r\nhaving been kept constantly on the move in the winter's storms, were\r\ncomplaining bitterly of their sufferings.\r\n\r\nIn view of this state of things they intimated, through their\r\nComanche-Apache friends at Fort Cobb, that they would like to make\r\nterms.  On receiving their messages I entered into negotiations with\r\nLittle Robe, chief of the Cheyennes, and Yellow Bear, chief of the\r\nArapahoes, and despatched envoys to have both tribes understand\r\nclearly that they must recognize their subjugation by surrendering at\r\nonce, and permanently settling on their reservations in the spring.\r\nOf course the usual delays of Indian diplomacy ensued, and it was\r\nsome weeks before I heard the result.\r\n\r\nThen one of my messengers returned with word that Little Robe and\r\nYellow Bear were on their way to see me.  They arrived a few days\r\nlater, and, promptly acceding to the terms, promised to bring their\r\npeople in, but as many of them would have to come on foot on account\r\nof the condition of the ponies, more time was solicited.  Convinced\r\nof the sincerity of their professions I gave them a reasonable\r\nextension, and eventually Yellow Bear made good his word, but Little\r\nRobe, in spite of earnest and repeated efforts, was unable to deliver\r\nhis people till further operations were begun against them.\r\n\r\nWhile these negotiations were in progess I came to the conclusion\r\nthat a permanent military post ought to be established well down on\r\nthe Kiowa and Comanche reservation, in order to keep an eye on these\r\ntribes in the future, Fort Cobb, being an unsuitable location,\r\nbecause too far to the north to protect the Texas frontier, and too\r\nfar away from where it was intended to permanently place the Indians.\r\nWith this purpose in view I had the country thoroughly explored, and\r\nafterward a place was fixed upon not far from the base of the\r\nWitchita Mountains, and near the confluence of Medicine Bluff and\r\nCash creeks, where building stone and timber could be obtained in\r\nplenty, and to this point I decided to move.  The place was named\r\nCamp Sill-now Fort Sill--in honor of my classmate, General Sill,\r\nkilled at Stone River; and to make sure of the surrendered Indians, I\r\nrequired them all, Kiowas, Comanches, and Comanche-Apaches, to\r\naccompany us to the new post, so they could be kept under military\r\ncontrol till they were settled.\r\n\r\nDuring the march to the new camp the weather was not so cold as that\r\nexperienced in coming down from Camp Supply; still, rains were\r\nfrequent, and each was invariably followed by a depression of\r\ntemperature and high winds, very destructive to our animals, much\r\nweakened by lack of food.  The men fared pretty well, however, for on\r\nthe rough march along the Washita, and during our stay at Fort Cobb,\r\nthey had learned to protect themselves materially from the cold.  For\r\nthis they had contrived many devices, the favorite means being\r\ndugouts--that is, pits dug in the ground, and roofed over, with\r\nshelter-tents, and having at one end a fire-place and chimney\r\ningeniously constructed with sod.  In these they lived very snugly\r\n--four men in each--and would often amuse themselves by poking their\r\nheads out and barking at the occupants of adjacent huts in imitation\r\nof the prairie-dog, whose comfortable nests had probably suggested\r\nthe idea of dugouts.  The men were much better off, in fact, than\r\nmany of the officers, for the high winds frequently made havoc with\r\nour wall-tents.  The horses and mules suffered most of all.  They\r\ncould not be sheltered, and having neither grain nor grass, the poor\r\nbeasts were in no condition to stand the chilling blasts.  Still, by\r\ncutting down cottonwood-trees, and letting the animals browse on the\r\nsmall soft branches, we managed to keep them up till, finally even\r\nthis wretched food beginning to grow scarce, I had all except a few\r\nof the strongest sent to Fort Arbuckle, near which place we had been\r\nable, fortunately, to purchase some fields of corn from the\r\nhalf-civilized Chickasaws and Choctaws.\r\n\r\nThrough mismanagement, as previously noted, the greater part of the\r\nsupplies which I had ordered hauled to Arbuckle the preceding fall\r\nhad not got farther on the way than Fort Gibson, which post was about\r\nfour hundred miles off, and the road abominable, particularly east of\r\nArbuckle, where it ran through a low region called \"boggy bottom.\"\r\nAll along this route were abandoned wagons, left sticking in the mud,\r\nand hence the transportation was growing so short that I began to\r\nfear trouble in getting subsistence up for the men.  Still, it would\r\nnot do to withdraw, so I made a trip to Arbuckle chiefly for the\r\npurpose of reorganizing the transportation, but also with a view to\r\nopening a new route to that post, the road to lie on high ground, so\r\nas to avoid the creeks and mud that had been giving us so much\r\ntrouble.  If such a road could be made, I hoped to get up enough\r\nrations and grain from the cornfields purchased to send out a\r\nformidable expedition against the Cheyennes, so I set out for\r\nArbuckle accompanied by my quartermaster, Colonel A. J. McGonigle.\r\n\"California Joe\" also went along to guide us through the scrub-oaks\r\ncovering the ridge, but even the most thorough exploration failed to\r\ndiscover any route more practicable than that already in use; indeed,\r\nthe high ground was, if anything, worse than the bottom land, our\r\nhorses in the springy places and quicksands often miring to their\r\nknees.  The ground was so soft and wet, in fact, that we had to make\r\nmost of the way on foot, so by the time we reached Arbuckle I was\r\nglad to abandon the new road project.\r\n\r\nFinding near Arbuckle more fields of corn than those already\r\npurchased, I had them bought also, and ordered more of the horses\r\nback there to be fed.  I next directed every available mule to be put\r\nto hauling rations, having discovered that the full capacity of the\r\ntransportation had not yet been brought into play in forwarding\r\nstores from Gibson, and with this regulation of the supply question I\r\nwas ready to return immediately to Camp Sill.  But my departure was\r\ndelayed by California Joe, who, notwithstanding the prohibitory laws\r\nof the Territory, in some unaccountable way had got gloriously tipsy,\r\nwhich caused a loss of time that disgusted me greatly; but as we\r\ncould not well do without Joe, I put off starting till the next day,\r\nby which time it was thought he would sober up.  But I might just as\r\nwell have gone at first, for at the end of the twenty-four hours the\r\nincorrigible old rascal was still dead drunk.  How he had managed to\r\nget the grog to keep up his spree was a mystery which we could not\r\nsolve, though we had had him closely watched, so I cut the matter\r\nshort by packing him into my ambulance and carrying him off to Camp\r\nSill.\r\n\r\nBy the time I got back to Sill, the Arapahoes were all in at the\r\npost, or near at hand.  The promised surrender of the Cheyennes was\r\nstill uncertain of fulfillment, however, and although Little Robe and\r\nhis family had remained with us in evidence of good faith, the\r\nmessages he sent to his followers brought no assurance of the tribe's\r\ncoming in--the runners invariably returning with requests for more\r\ntime, and bringing the same old excuse of inability to move because\r\nthe ponies were so badly off.  But more time was just what I was\r\ndetermined not to grant, for I felt sure that if a surrender was not\r\nforced before the spring grass came, the ponies would regain their\r\nstrength, and then it would be doubtful if the Cheyennes came in at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nTo put an end to these delays, Custer proposed to go out and see the\r\nCheyennes himself, taking with him for escort only such number of men\r\nas could be fairly well mounted from the few horses not sent back to\r\nArbuckle.  At first I was inclined to disapprove Custer's\r\nproposition, but he urged it so strongly that I finally consented,\r\nthough with some misgivings, for I feared that so small a party might\r\ntempt the Cheyennes to forget their pacific professions and seek to\r\navenge the destruction of Black Kettle's band.  However, after\r\nobtaining my approval, Custer, with characteristic energy, made his\r\npreparations, and started with three or four officers and forty\r\npicked men, taking along as negotiators Yellow Bear and Little Robe,\r\nwho were also to conduct him to the head-waters of the Red River,\r\nwhere it was supposed the Cheyennes would be found.  His progress was\r\nreported by couriers every few days, and by the time he got to the\r\nWitchita foot-hills he had grown so sanguine that he sent California\r\nJoe back to me with word that he was certain of success.  Such\r\nhopeful anticipation relieved me greatly, of course, but just about\r\nthe time I expected to hear that his mission had been achieved I was\r\nastonished by the party's return.  Inquiring as to the trouble, I\r\nlearned that out toward the Staked Plains every sign of the Cheyennes\r\nhad disappeared.  Surprised and disappointed at this, and discouraged\r\nby the loneliness of his situation--for in the whole region not a\r\ntrace of animal life was visible, Custer gave up the search, and none\r\ntoo soon, I am inclined to believe, to save his small party from\r\nperishing.\r\n\r\nThis failure put a stop to all expeditions till the latter part of\r\nFebruary, by which time I had managed to lay in enough rations to\r\nfeed the command for about thirty days; and the horses back at\r\nArbuckle having picked up sufficiently for field service they were\r\nordered to Sill, and this time I decided to send Custer out with his\r\nown and the Kansas regiment, with directions to insist on the\r\nimmediate surrender of the Cheyennes, or give them a sound thrashing.\r\nHe was ordered to get everything ready by March 1, and then move to\r\nthe mouth of Salt Creek, on the North Fork of the Red River, at which\r\nplace I proposed to establish a new depot for feeding the command.\r\nTrains could reach this point from Camp Supply more readily than from\r\nArbuckle, and wishing to arrange this part of the programme in\r\nperson, I decided to return at once to Supply, and afterward rejoin\r\nCuster at Salt Creek, on what, I felt sure, was to be the final\r\nexpedition of the campaign.  I made the three hundred and sixty miles\r\nfrom Sill to Supply in seven days, but much to my surprise there\r\nfound a despatch from General Grant directing me to repair\r\nimmediately to Washington.  These orders precluded, of course, my\r\nrejoining the command; but at the appointed time it set out on the\r\nmarch, and within three weeks brought the campaign to a successful\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nIn this last expedition, for the first few days Custer's route was by\r\nthe same trail he had taken in January--that is to say, along the\r\nsouthern base of the Witchita Mountains--but this time there was more\r\nto encourage him than before, for, on getting a couple of marches\r\nbeyond old Camp Radziminski, on all sides were fresh evidences of\r\nIndians, and every effort was bent to strike them.\r\n\r\nFrom day to day the signs grew hotter, and toward the latter part of\r\nMarch the game was found.  The Indians being in a very forlorn\r\ncondition, Custer might have destroyed most of the tribe, and\r\ncertainly all their villages, but in order to save two white women\r\nwhom, it was discovered, they held as captives, he contented himself\r\nwith the renewal of the Cheyennes' agreement to come in to Camp\r\nSupply.  In due time the entire tribe fulfilled its promise except\r\none small band under \"Tall Bull,\" but this party received a good\r\ndrubbing from General Carr on the Republican early in May.  After\r\nthis fight all the Indians of the southern Plains settled down on\r\ntheir reservations, and I doubt whether the peace would ever again\r\nhave been broken had they not in after years been driven to\r\nhostilities by most unjust treatment.\r\n\r\nIt was the 2d of March that I received at Camp Supply Grant's\r\ndespatch directing me to report immediately in Washington.  It had\r\nbeen my intention, as I have said, to join Custer on the North Fork\r\nof the Red River, but this new order required me to recast my plans,\r\nso, after arranging to keep the expedition supplied till the end of\r\nthe campaign, I started for Washington, accompanied by three of my\r\nstaff--Colonels McGonigle and Crosby, and Surgeon Asch, and Mr. Deb.\r\nRandolph Keim, a representative of the press, who went through the\r\nwhole campaign, and in 1870 published a graphic history of it.  The\r\nday we left Supply we, had another dose of sleet and snow, but\r\nnevertheless we made good time, and by night-fall reached Bluff\r\nCreek.  In twenty-four hours more we made Fort Dodge, and on the 6th\r\nof March arrived at Fort Hays.  Just south of the Smoky Hill River, a\r\nlittle before we got to the post, a courier heading for Fort Dodge\r\npassed us at a rapid gait.  Suspecting that he had despatches for me,\r\nI directed my outrider to overtake him and find out.  The courier\r\nsoon turned back, and riding up to my ambulance handed me a telegram\r\nnotifying me that General Grant, on the day of his inauguration,\r\nMarch 4, 1869, had appointed me Lieutenant-General of the Army.  When\r\nI reported in Washington, the President desired me to return to New\r\nOrleans and resume command of the Fifth Military District, but this\r\nwas not at all to my liking, so I begged off, and was assigned to\r\ntake charge of the Division of the Missouri, succeeding General\r\nSherman, who had just been ordered to assume command of the Army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nINSPECTING MILITARY POSTS IN UTAH AND MONTANA--DESIRE TO WITNESS THE\r\nFRANCO-GERMAN WAR--ON A SAND-BAR IN THE MISSOURI--A BEAR HUNT--AN\r\nINDIAN SCARE--MYRIADS OF MOSQUITOES--PERMISSION GIVEN TO VISIT\r\nEUROPE--CALLING ON PRESIDENT GRANT--SAILING FOR LIVERPOOL--ARRIVAL IN\r\nBERLIN.\r\n\r\nAfter I had for a year been commanding the Division of the Missouri,\r\nwhich embraced the entire Rocky Mountain region, I found it necessary\r\nto make an inspection of the military posts in northern Utah and\r\nMontana, in order by personal observation to inform myself of their\r\nlocation and needs, and at the same time become acquainted with the\r\nsalient geographical and topographical features of that section of my\r\ndivision.  Therefore in May, 1870, I started west by the\r\nUnion-Pacific railroad, and on arriving at Corinne' Station, the next\r\nbeyond Ogden, took passage by stage-coach for Helena, the capital of\r\nMontana Territory.  Helena is nearly five hundred miles north of\r\nCorinne, and under ordinary conditions the journey was, in those\r\ndays, a most tiresome one.  As the stage kept jogging on day and\r\nnight, there was little chance for sleep, and there being with me a\r\nsufficient number of staff-officers to justify the proceeding, we\r\nchartered the \"outfit,\" stipulating that we were to stop over one\r\nnight on the road to get some rest.  This rendered the journey more\r\ntolerable, and we arrived at Helena without extraordinary fatigue.\r\n\r\nBefore I left Chicago the newspapers were filled with rumors of\r\nimpending war between Germany and France.  I was anxious to observe\r\nthe conflict, if it was to occur, but reports made one day concerning\r\nthe beginning of hostilities would be contradicted the next, and it\r\nwas not till I reached Helena that the despatches lost their doubtful\r\ncharacter, and later became of so positive a nature as to make it\r\ncertain that the two nations would fight.  I therefore decided to cut\r\nshort my tour of inspection, so that I could go abroad to witness the\r\nwar, if the President would approve.  This resolution limited my stay\r\nin Helena to a couple of days, which were devoted to arranging for an\r\nexploration of what are now known as the Upper and the Lower Geyser\r\nBasins of the Yellowstone Park.  While journeying between Corinne and\r\nHelena I had gained some vague knowledge of these geysers from an old\r\nmountaineer named Atkinson, but his information was very indefinite,\r\nmostly second-hand; and there was such general uncertainty as to the\r\ncharacter of this wonderland that I authorized an escort of soldiers\r\nto go that season from Fort Ellis with a small party, to make such\r\nsuperficial explorations as to justify my sending an engineer officer\r\nwith a well-equipped expedition there next summer to scientifically\r\nexamine and report upon the strange country.  When the arrangements\r\nfor this preliminary expedition were completed I started for Fort\r\nBenton, the head of navigation on the Missouri River, on the way\r\npassing through Fort Shaw, on Sun River.  I expected to take at\r\nBenton a steamboat to Fort Stevenson, a military post which had been\r\nestablished about eighty miles south of Fort Buford, near a\r\nsettlement of friendly Mandan and Arickaree Indians, to protect them\r\nfrom the hostile Sioux.  From there I was to make my way overland,\r\nfirst to Fort Totten near Devil's lake in Dakota, and thence by way\r\nof Fort Abercrombie to Saint Cloud, Minnesota, the terminus of the\r\nrailroad.\r\n\r\nLuckily I met with no delay in getting a boat at Benton, and though\r\nthe water was extremely low, we steamed down the channel of the\r\nMissouri with but slight detention till we got within fifty miles of\r\nFort Buford.  Here we struck on a sandbar with such force of steam\r\nand current as to land us almost out of the water from stem to\r\nmidships.  This bad luck was tantalizing, for to land on a bar when\r\nyour boat is under full headway down-stream in the Missouri River is\r\nno trifling matter, especially if you want to make time, for the\r\nrapid and turbid stream quickly depositing sand under the hull, makes\r\nit commonly a task of several days to get your boat off again.  As\r\nfrom our mishap the loss of much time was inevitable, I sent a\r\nmessenger to Fort Buford for a small escort, and for horses to take\r\nmy party in to the post.  Colonel Morrow, the commandant, came\r\nhimself to meet us, bringing a strong party of soldiers and some\r\nfriendly Indian scouts, because, he said, there were then in the\r\nregion around Buford so many treacherous band of Sioux as to make\r\nthings exceedingly unsafe.\r\n\r\nDesiring to reach the post without spending more than one night on\r\nthe way, we abandoned our steamer that evening, and set off at an\r\nearly hour the next morning.  We made camp at the end of the day's\r\nmarch within ten miles of Buford, and arrived at the post without\r\nhaving had any incident of moment, unless we may dignify as one a\r\nbattle with three grizzly bears, discovered by our friendly Indians\r\nthe morning of our second day's journey.  While eating our breakfast\r\n--a rather slim one, by the way--spread on a piece of canvas, the\r\nIndians, whose bivouac was some distance off, began shouting\r\nexcitedly, \"Bear! bear!\" and started us all up in time to see, out on\r\nthe plain some hundreds of yards away, an enormous grizzly and two\r\nalmost full-grown cubs.  Chances like this for a bear hunt seldom\r\noffered, so there was hurried mounting--the horses being already\r\nsaddled--and a quick advance made on the game from many directions,\r\nLieutenant Townsend, of the escort, and five or six of the Indians\r\ngoing with me.  Alarmed by the commotion, bruin and her cubs turned\r\nabout, and with an awkward yet rapid gait headed for a deep ravine,\r\nin which there was brushwood shelter.\r\n\r\nMy party rode directly across the prairie and struck the trail not\r\nfar behind the game.  Then for a mile or more the chase was kept up,\r\nbut with such poor shooting because of the \"buck fever\" which had\r\nseized most of us, that we failed to bring down any of the grizzlies,\r\nthough the cubs grew so tired that the mother was often obliged to\r\nhalt for their defense, meanwhile urging them on before her.  When\r\nthe ravine was gained she hid the cubs away in the thick brushwood,\r\nand then coming out where we could plainly see her, stood on the\r\ndefense just within the edge of the thicket, beyond the range of our\r\nrifles though, unless we went down into the canyon, which we would\r\nhave to do on foot, since the precipitous wall precluded going on\r\nhorseback.  For an adventure like this I confess I had little\r\ninclination, and on holding a council of war, I found that the\r\nIndians had still less, but Lieutenant Townsend, who was a fine shot,\r\nand had refrained from firing hitherto in the hope that I might bag\r\nthe game, relieved the embarrassing situation and saved the credit of\r\nthe party by going down alone to attack the enemy.  Meanwhile I\r\nmagnanimously held his horse, and the Sioux braves did a deal of\r\nshouting, which they seemed to think of great assistance.\r\n\r\nTownsend, having descended to the bottom of the ravine, approached\r\nwithin range, when the old bear struck out, dashing into and out of\r\nthe bushes so rapidly, however, that he could not get fair aim at\r\nher, but the startled cubs running into full view, he killed one at\r\nthe first shot and at the second wounded the other.  This terribly\r\nenraged the mother, and she now came boldly out to fight, exposing\r\nherself in the open ground so much as to permit a shot, that brought\r\nher down too, with a broken shoulder.  Then the Indians and I,\r\ngrowing very brave, scrambled down to--take part in the fight.  It\r\nwas left for me to despatch the wounded cub and mother, and having\r\nrecovered possession of my nerves, I did the work effectively, and we\r\ncarried off with us the skins of the three animals as trophies of the\r\nhunt and evidence of our prowess.\r\n\r\nAs good luck would have it, when we reached Buford we found a\r\nsteamboat there unloading stores, and learned that it would be ready\r\nto start down the river the next day.  Embarking on her, we got to\r\nStevenson in a few hours, and finding at the post camp equipage that\r\nhad been made ready for our use in crossing overland to Fort Totten,\r\nwe set out the following forenoon, taking with us a small escort of\r\ninfantry, transported in two light wagons, a couple of Mandans and\r\nthe post interpreter going along as mounted guides.\r\n\r\nTo reach water we had to march the first day to a small lake forty\r\nmiles off, and the oppressive heat, together with the long distance\r\ntraveled, used up one of the teams so much that, when about to start\r\nout the second morning, we found the animals unable to go on with any\r\nprospect of finishing the trip, so I ordered them to be rested\r\nforty-eight hours longer, and then taken back to Stevenson.  This\r\ndiminished the escort by one-half, yet by keeping the Indians and\r\ninterpreter on the lookout, and seeing that our ambulance was kept\r\nclosed up on the wagon carrying the rest of the detachment, we could,\r\nI thought, stand off any ordinary party of hostile Indians.\r\n\r\nAbout noon I observed that the scouts in advance had left the trail\r\nand begun to reconnoitre a low ridge to their right, the sequel of\r\nwhich was that in a few minutes they returned to the wagons on a dead\r\nrun and reported Sioux just ahead.  Looking in the direction\r\nindicated, I could dimly see five or six horsemen riding in a circle,\r\nas Indians do when giving warning to their camp, but as our halt\r\ndisclosed that we were aware of their proximity, they darted back\r\nagain behind the crest of the ridge.  Anticipating from this move an\r\nimmediate attack, we hastily prepared for it by unhooking the mules\r\nfrom the wagon and ambulance, so that we could use the vehicles as a\r\nbarricade.  This done, I told the interpreter to take the Mandan\r\nscouts and go over toward the ridge and reconnoitre again.  As the\r\nscouts neared the crest two of them dismounted, and, crawling slowly\r\non their bellies to the summit, took a hasty look and returned at\r\nonce to their horses, coming back with word that in the valley beyond\r\nwas a camp of at least a hundred Sioux lodges, and that the Indians\r\nwere hurriedly getting ready to attack us.  The news was anything but\r\ncheering, for with a village of that size the warriors would number\r\ntwo or three hundred, and could assail us from every side.\r\n\r\nStill, nothing could be done, but stand and take what was to come,\r\nfor there was no chance of escape--it being supreme folly to\r\nundertake in wagons a race with Indians to Fort Stevenson, sixty\r\nmiles away.  To make the best of the situation, we unloaded the\r\nbaggage, distributing and adjusting the trunks, rolls of bedding,\r\ncrackerboxes, and everything else that would stop a bullet, in such\r\nmanner as to form a square barricade, two sides of which were the\r\nwagons, with the mules haltered to the wheels.  Every man then\r\nsupplied himself with all the ammunition he could carry, and the\r\nMandan scouts setting up the depressing wail of the Indian\r\ndeath-song, we all awaited the attack with the courage of despair.\r\n\r\nBut no attack came; and time slipping by, and we still unmolested,\r\nthe interpreter and scouts were sent out to make another\r\nreconnoissance.  Going through just such precautions as before in\r\napproaching the ridge, their slow progress kept us in painful\r\nsuspense; but when they got to the crest the strain on our nerves was\r\nrelieved by seeing them first stand up boldly at full height, and\r\nthen descend beyond.  Quickly returning, they brought welcome word\r\nthat the whole thing was a mistake, and no Sioux were there at all.\r\nWhat had been taken for a hundred Indian lodges turned out to be the\r\ncamp of a Government train on its way to Fort Stevenson, and the\r\nofficer in charge seeing the scouts before they discovered him, and\r\nbelieving them to be Sioux, had sent out to bring his herds in.  It\r\nwould be hard to exaggerate the relief that this discovery gave us,\r\nand we all breathed much easier.  The scare was a bad one, and I have\r\nno hesitation in saying that, had we been mounted, it is more than\r\nlikely that, instead of showing fight, we would have taken up a\r\nlively pace for Fort Stevenson.\r\n\r\nAfter reciprocal explanations with the officer in charge of the\r\ntrain, the march was resumed, and at the close of that day we camped\r\nnear a small lake about twenty miles from Fort Totten.  From Totten\r\nwe journeyed on to Fort Abercrombie.  The country between the two\r\nposts is low and flat, and I verily believe was then the favorite\r\nabiding-place of the mosquito, no matter where he most loves to dwell\r\nnow; for myriads of the pests rose up out of the tall rank grass\r\n--more than I ever saw before or since--and viciously attacked both\r\nmen and animals.  We ourselves were somewhat protected by gloves and\r\nhead-nets, provided us before leaving Totten, but notwithstanding these\r\nour sufferings were well-nigh intolerable; the annoyance that the poor\r\nmules experienced must, therefore, have been extreme; indeed, they were\r\nso terribly stung that the blood fairly trickled down their sides.\r\nUnluckily, we had to camp for one night in this region; but we partly\r\nevaded the ravenous things by banking up our tent walls with earth, and\r\nthen, before turning in, sweeping and smoking out such as had got\r\ninside.  Yet with all this there seemed hundreds left to sing and sting\r\nthroughout the night.  The mules being without protection, we tried\r\nhard to save them from the vicious insects by creating a dense smoke\r\nfrom a circle of smothered fires, within which chain the grateful\r\nbrutes gladly stood; but this relief was only partial, so the moment\r\nthere was light enough to enable us to hook up we pulled out for\r\nAbercrombie in hot haste.\r\n\r\nFrom Abercrombie we drove on to Saint Cloud, the terminus of the\r\nrailroad, where, considerably the worse for our hurried trip and\r\ntruly wretched experience with the mosquitoes, we boarded the welcome\r\ncars.  Two days later we arrived in Chicago, and having meanwhile\r\nreceived word from General Sherman that there would be no objection\r\nto my going to Europe, I began making arrangements to leave, securing\r\npassage by the steamship Scotia.\r\n\r\nPresident Grant invited me to come to see him at Long Branch before I\r\nshould sail, and during my brief visit there he asked which army I\r\nwished to accompany, the German or the French.  I told him the\r\nGerman, for the reason that I thought more could be seen with the\r\nsuccessful side, and that the indications pointed to the defeat of\r\nthe French.  My choice evidently pleased him greatly, as he had the\r\nutmost contempt for Louis Napoleon, and had always denounced him as a\r\nusurper and a charlatan.  Before we separated, the President gave me\r\nthe following letter to the representatives of our Government abroad,\r\nand with it I not only had no trouble in obtaining permission to go\r\nwith the Germans, but was specially favored by being invited to\r\naccompany the headquarters of the King of Prussia:\r\n\r\n\"LONG BRANCH, N. J., July 25, 1870.\r\n\r\n\"Lieutenant-General P. H. Sheridan, of the United State Army, is\r\nauthorized to visit Europe, to return at his own pleasure, unless\r\notherwise ordered.  He is commended to the good offices of all\r\nrepresentatives of this Government whom he may meet abroad.\r\n\r\n\"To citizens and representatives of other Governments I introduce\r\nGeneral Sheridan as one of the most skillful, brave and deserving\r\nsoldiers developed by the great struggle through which the United\r\nStates Government has just passed.  Attention paid him will be duly\r\nappreciated by the country he has served so faithfully and\r\nefficiently.\r\n\r\n\"U. S. GRANT.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWord of my intended trip was cabled to Europe in the ordinary press\r\ndespatches, and our Minister to France, Mr. Elihu B. Washburn, being\r\nan intimate friend of mine, and thinking that I might wish to attach\r\nmyself to the French army, did me the favor to take preliminary steps\r\nfor securing the necessary authority.  He went so far as to broach\r\nthe subject to the French Minister of War, but in view of the\r\ninformality of the request, and an unmistakable unwillingness to\r\ngrant it being manifested, Mr. Washburn pursued the matter no\r\nfurther.  I did not learn of this kindly interest in my behalf till\r\nafter the capitulation of Paris, when Mr. Washburn told me what he\r\nhad done of his own motion.  Of course I thanked him gratefully, but\r\neven had he succeeded in getting the permission he sought I should\r\nnot have accompanied the French army.\r\n\r\nI sailed from New York July 27, one of my aides-de-camp, General\r\nJames W. Forsyth, going with me.  We reached Liverpool August 6, and\r\nthe next day visited the American Legation in London, where we saw\r\nall the officials except our Minister, Mr. Motley, who, being absent,\r\nwas represented by Mr. Moran, the Secretary of the Legation.  We left\r\nLondon August 9 for Brussels, where we were kindly cared for by the\r\nAmerican Minister, Mr. Russell Jones who the same evening saw us off\r\nfor Germany.  Because of the war we secured transportation only as\r\nfar as Vera, and here we received information that the Prussian\r\nMinister of War had telegraphed to the Military Inspector of\r\nRailroads to take charge of us on our arrival a Cologne, and send us\r\ndown to the headquarter of the Prussian army, but the Inspector, for\r\nsome unexplained reason, instead of doing this, sent us on to Berlin.\r\nHere our Minister, Mr. George Bancroft, met us with a telegram from\r\nthe German Chancellor, Count Bismarck, saying we were expected to\r\ncome direct to the King's headquarters and we learned also that a\r\ndespatch had been sent to the Prussian Minister at Brussels directing\r\nhim to forward us from Cologne to the army, instead of allowing us to\r\ngo on to Berlin, but that we had reached and quit Brussels without\r\nthe Minister's knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nLEAVING FOR THE SEAT OF WAR--MEETING WITH PRINCE BISMARCK--HIS\r\nINTEREST IN PUBLIC OPINION IN AMERICA--HIS INCLINATIONS IN EARLY\r\nLIFE--PRESENTED TO THE KING--THE BATTLE OF GRAVELOTTE--THE GERMAN\r\nPLAN--ITS FINAL SUCCESS--SENDING NEWS OF THE VICTORY--MISTAKEN FOR A\r\nFRENCHMAN.\r\n\r\nShortly after we arrived in Berlin the Queen sent a messenger\r\noffering us an opportunity to pay our respects, and fixed an hour for\r\nthe visit, which was to take place the next day; but as the tenor of\r\nthe despatch Mr. Bancroft had received from Count Bismarck indicated\r\nthat some important event which it was desired I should witness was\r\nabout to happen at the theatre of war, our Minister got us excused\r\nfrom our visit of ceremony, and we started for the headquarters of\r\nthe German army that evening--our stay in the Prussian capital having\r\nbeen somewhat less than a day.\r\n\r\nOur train was a very long one, of over eighty cars, and though drawn\r\nby three locomotives, its progress to Cologne was very slow and the\r\njourney most tedious.  From Cologne we continued on by rail up the\r\nvalley of the Rhine to Bingebruck, near Bingen, and thence across\r\nthrough Saarbrucken to Remilly, where we left the railway and rode in\r\na hay-wagon to Pont-a-Mousson, arriving there August 17, late in the\r\nafternoon.  This little city had been ceded to France at the Peace of\r\nWestphalia, and although originally German, the people had become, in\r\nthe lapse of so many years, intensely French in sentiment.  The town\r\nwas so full of officers and men belonging to the German army that it\r\nwas difficult to get lodgings, but after some delay we found quite\r\ncomfortable quarters at one of the small hotels, and presently, after\r\nwe had succeeded in getting a slender meal, I sent my card to Count\r\nvon Bismarck, the Chancellor of the North German Confederation, who\r\nsoon responded by appointing an hour--about 9 o'clock the same\r\nevening--for an interview.\r\n\r\nWhen the Count received me he was clothed in the undress uniform of\r\nthe Cuirassier regiment, of which he was the colonel.  During the\r\ninterview which ensued, he exhibited at times deep anxiety regarding\r\nthe conflict now imminent, for it was the night before the battle of\r\nGravelotte, but his conversation was mostly devoted to the state of\r\npublic sentiment in America, about which he seemed much concerned,\r\ninquiring repeatedly as to which side--France or Prussia--was charged\r\nwith bringing on the war.  Expressing a desire to witness the battle\r\nwhich was expected to occur the next day, and remarking that I had\r\nnot had sufficient time to provide the necessary transportation, he\r\ntold me to be ready at 4 o'clock in the morning, and he would take me\r\nout in his own carriage and present me to the King--adding that he\r\nwould ask one of his own staff-officers, who he knew had one or two\r\nextra horses, to lend me one.  As I did not know just what my status\r\nwould be, and having explained to the President before leaving\r\nAmerica that I wished to accompany the German army unofficially, I\r\nhardly knew whether to appear in uniform or not, so I spoke of this\r\nmatter too, and the Count, after some reflection, thought it best for\r\nme to wear my undress uniform, minus the sword, however, because I\r\nwas a non combatant.\r\n\r\nAt 4 o'clock the next morning, the 18th, I repaired to the\r\nChancellor's quarters.  The carriage was at the door, also the\r\nsaddle-horse, but as no spare mount could be procured for General\r\nForsyth, he had to seek other means to reach the battle-field.  The\r\ncarriage was an open one with two double seats, and in front a single\r\none for a messenger; it had also a hand-brake attached.\r\n\r\n\r\nCount Bismarck and I occupied the rear seat, and Count\r\nBismarck-Bohlen--the nephew and aide-decamp to the Chancellor--and\r\nDoctor Busch were seated facing us.  The conveyance was strong,\r\nserviceable, and comfortable, but not specially prepossessing, and\r\nhitched to it were four stout horses--logy, ungainly animals, whose\r\nclumsy harness indicated that the whole equipment was meant for heavy\r\nwork.  Two postilions in uniform, in high military saddles on the nigh\r\nhorse of each span, completed the establishment.\r\n\r\nAll being ready, we took one of the roads from Pont-a-Mousson to\r\nRezonville, which is on the direct road from Metz to Chalons, and\r\nnear the central point of the field where, on the 16th of August, the\r\nbattle of Mars-la-Tour had been fought.  It was by this road that the\r\nPomeranians, numbering about 30,000 men, had been ordered to march to\r\nGravelotte, and after proceeding a short distance we overtook the\r\ncolumn.  As this contingent came from Count Bismarck's own section of\r\nGermany, there greeted us as we passed along, first in the dim light\r\nof the morning, and later in the glow of the rising sun, continuous\r\nand most enthusiastic cheering for the German Chancellor.\r\n\r\nOn the way Count Bismarck again recurred to the state of public\r\nopinion in America with reference to the war.  He also talked much\r\nabout our form of government, and said that in early life his\r\ntendencies were all toward republicanism, but that family influence\r\nhad overcome his preferences, and intimated that, after adopting a\r\npolitical career, he found that Germany was not sufficiently advanced\r\nfor republicanism.  He said, further, that he had been reluctant to\r\nenter upon this public career, that he had always longed to be a\r\nsoldier, but that here again family opposition had turned him from\r\nthe field of his choice into the sphere of diplomacy.\r\n\r\nNot far from Mars-la-Tour we alighted, and in a little while an\r\naide-de-camp was introduced, who informed me that he was there to\r\nconduct and present me to his Majesty, the King of Prussia.  As we were\r\nwalking along together, I inquired whether at the meeting I should\r\nremove my cap, and he said no; that in an out-of-door presentation it\r\nwas not etiquette to uncover if in uniform.  We were soon in presence\r\nof the King, where--under the shade of a clump of second-growth\r\npoplar-trees, with which nearly all the farms in the north of France\r\nare here and there dotted--the presentation was made in the simplest\r\nand most agreeable manner.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty, taking my hand in both of his, gave me a thorough\r\nwelcome, expressing, like Count Bismarck, though through an\r\ninterpreter, much interest as to the sentiment in my own country\r\nabout the war.  At this time William the First of Prussia was\r\nseventy-three years of age, and, dressed in the uniform of the\r\nGuards, he seemed to be the very ideal soldier, and graced with most\r\ngentle and courteous manners.  The conversation, which was brief, as\r\nneither of us spoke the other's native tongue, concluded by his\r\nMajesty's requesting me in the most cordial way to accompany his\r\nheadquarters during the campaign.  Thanking him for his kindness, I\r\nrejoined Count Bismarck's party, and our horses having arrived\r\nmeantime, we mounted and moved off to the position selected for the\r\nKing to witness the opening of the battle.\r\n\r\nThis place was on some high ground overlooking the villages of\r\nRezonville and Gravelotte, about the centre of the battlefield of\r\nMars-la-Tour, and from it most of the country to the east toward Metz\r\ncould also be seen.  The point chosen was an excellent one for the\r\npurpose, though in one respect disagreeable, since the dead bodies of\r\nmany of the poor fellows killed there two days before were yet\r\nunburied.  In a little while the King's escort began to remove these\r\ndead, however, bearing them away on stretchers improvised with their\r\nrifles, and the spot thus cleared was much more acceptable.  Then,\r\nwhen such unexploded shells as were lying around loose had been\r\ncautiously carried away, the King, his brother, Prince Frederick\r\nCharles Alexander, the chief-of-staff, General von Moltke, the\r\nMinister of War, General von Roon, and Count von Bismarck assembled\r\non the highest point, and I being asked to join the group, was there\r\npresented to General von Moltke.  He spoke our language fluently, and\r\nBismarck having left the party for a time to go to a neighboring\r\nhouse to see his son, who had been wounded at Mars-la-Tour, and about\r\nwhom he was naturally very anxious, General von Moltke entertained me\r\nby explaining the positions of the different corps, the nature and\r\nobject of their movements then taking place, and so on.\r\n\r\nBefore us, and covering Metz, lay the French army, posted on the\r\ncrest of a ridge extending north, and about its centre curving\r\nslightly westward toward the German forces.  The left of the French\r\nposition was but a short distance from the Moselle, and this part of\r\nthe line was separated from the Germans by a ravine, the slopes,\r\nfairly well wooded, rising quite sharply; farther north, near the\r\ncentre, this depression disappeared, merged in the general swell of\r\nthe ground, and thence on toward the right the ground over which an\r\napproach to the French line must be made was essentially a natural\r\nopen glacis, that could be thoroughly swept by the fire of the\r\ndefenders.\r\n\r\nThe line extended some seven or eight miles.  To attack this\r\nposition, formidable everywhere, except perhaps on the right flank,\r\nthe Germans were bringing up the combined forces of the First and\r\nSecond armies, troops that within the past fortnight had already\r\nsuccessfully met the French in three pitched battles.  On the right\r\nwas the First Army, under command of General Von Steinmetz, the\r\nvictors, August 6, of Spicheren, near Saar, and, eight days later, of\r\nColombey, to the east of Metz; while the centre and left were\r\ncomposed of the several corps of the Second Army, commanded by Prince\r\nFrederick Charles of Prussia, a part of whose troops had just been\r\nengaged in the sanguinary battle of Mars-la-Tour, by which Bazaine\r\nwas cut off from the Verdun road, and forced back toward Metz.\r\n\r\nAt first the German plan was simply to threaten with their right,\r\nwhile the corps of the Second Army advanced toward the north, to\r\nprevent the French, of whose intentions there was much doubt, from\r\nescaping toward Chalons; then, as the purposes of the French might\r\nbe, developed, these corps were to change direction toward the enemy\r\nsuccessively, and seek to turn his right flank.  But the location of\r\nthis vital turning-point was very uncertain, and until it was\r\nascertained and carried, late in the afternoon, the action raged with\r\nmore or less intensity along the entire line.\r\n\r\nBut as it is not my purpose to describe in detail the battle of\r\nGravelotte, nor any other, I will speak of some of its incidents\r\nmerely.  About noon, after many preliminary skirmishes, the action\r\nwas begun according to the plan I have already outlined, the Germans\r\nadvancing their left while holding on strongly with their right, and\r\nit was this wing (the First Army) that came under my observation from\r\nthe place where the King's headquarters were located.  From here we\r\ncould see, as I have said, the village of Gravelotte.  Before it lay\r\nthe German troops, concealed to some extent, especially to the left,\r\nby clumps of timber here and there.  Immediately in front of us,\r\nhowever, the ground was open, and the day being clear and sunny, with\r\na fresh breeze blowing (else the smoke from a battle between four\r\nhundred thousand men would have obstructed the view altogether), the\r\nspectacle presented Was of unsurpassed magnificence and sublimity.\r\nThe German artillery opened the battle, and while the air was filled\r\nwith shot and shell from hundreds of guns along their entire line,\r\nthe German centre and left, in rather open order, moved out to the\r\nattack, and as they went forward the reserves, in close column, took\r\nup positions within supporting distances, yet far enough back to be\r\nout of range.\r\n\r\nThe French artillery and mitrailleuses responded vigorously to the\r\nKrupps, and with deadly effect, but as far as we could see the German\r\nleft continued its advance, and staff-officers came up frequently to\r\nreport that all was going on well at points hidden from our view\r\nThese reports were always made to the King first, and whenever\r\nanybody arrived with tidings of the fight we clustered around to hear\r\nthe news, General Von Moltke unfolding a map meanwhile, and\r\nexplaining the situation.  This done, the chief of the staff, while\r\nawaiting the next report, would either return to a seat that had been\r\nmade for him with some knapsacks, or would occupy the time walking\r\nabout, kicking clods of dirt or small stones here and there, his\r\nhands clasped behind his back, his face pale and thoughtful.  He was\r\nthen nearly seventy years old, but because of his emaciated figure,\r\nthe deep wrinkles in his face, and the crow's-feet about his eyes, he\r\nlooked even older, his appearance being suggestive of the practice of\r\nchurch asceticisms rather than of his well-known ardent devotion to\r\nthe military profession.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the afternoon the steady progress of the German left\r\nand centre had driven the French from their more advanced positions\r\nfrom behind stone walls and hedges, through valleys and hamlets, in\r\nthe direction of Metz, but as yet the German right had accomplished\r\nlittle  except to get possession of the village of Gravelotte,\r\nforcing the French across the deep ravine I have mentioned, which\r\nruns north and south a little distance east of ihe town.\r\n\r\nBut it was now time for the German right to move in earnest to carry\r\nthe Rozerieulles ridge, on which crest the French had evidently\r\ndecided to make an obstinate fight to cover their withdrawal to Metz.\r\nAs the Germans moved to the attack here, the French fire became heavy\r\nand destructive, so much so, indeed, as to cause General Von\r\nSteinmetz to order some cavalry belonging to the right wing to make a\r\ncharge.  Crossing the ravine before described, this body of horse\r\nswept up the slope beyond, the front ranks urged forward by the\r\nmomentum from behind.  The French were posted along a sunken road,\r\nbehind stone walls and houses, and as the German cavalry neared these\r\nobstructions it received a dreadful fire without the least chance of\r\nreturning it, though still pushed on till the front ranks were\r\ncrowded into the deep cut of the road.  Here the slaughter was\r\nterrible, for the horsemen could make no further headway; and because\r\nof the blockade behind, of dead and wounded men and animals, an\r\norderly retreat was impossible, and disaster inevitable.\r\n\r\nAbout the time the charge was ordered, the phase of the battle was\r\nsuch that the King concluded to move his headquarters into the\r\nvillage of Gravelotte; and just after getting there, we first learned\r\nfully of the disastrous result of the charge which had been entered\r\nupon with such spirit; and so much indignation was expressed against\r\nSteinmetz, who, it was claimed, had made an unnecessary sacrifice of\r\nhis cavalry, that I thought he would be relieved on the spot; though\r\nthis was not done.\r\n\r\nFollowed by a large staff, General Steinmetz appeared in the village\r\npresently, and approached the King.  When near, he bowed with great\r\nrespect, and I then saw that he was a very old man though his\r\nsoldierly figure, bronzed face, and shortcropped hair gave some\r\nevidence of vigor still.  When the King spoke to him I was not close\r\nenough to learn what was said; but his Majesty's manner was\r\nexpressive of kindly feeling, and the fact that in a few moments the\r\nveteran general returned to the command of his troops, indicated\r\nthat, for the present at least, his fault had been overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe King then moved out of the village, and just a little to the east\r\nand north of it the headquarters were located on high, open ground,\r\nwhence we could observe the right of the German infantry advancing up\r\nthe eastern face of the ravine.  The advance, though slow and\r\nirregular, resulted in gradually gaining ground, the French resisting\r\nstoutly with a stubborn musketry fire all along the slopes.  Their\r\nartillery was silent, however; and from this fact the German\r\nartillery officers grew jubilant, confidently asserting that their\r\nKrupp guns had dismounted the French batteries and knocked their\r\nmitrailleuses to pieces.  I did not indulge in this confidence,\r\nhowever; for, with the excellent field-glass I had, I could\r\ndistinctly see long columns of French troops moving to their right,\r\nfor the apparent purpose of making a vigorous fight on that flank;\r\nand I thought it more than likely that their artillery would be heard\r\nfrom before the Germans could gain the coveted ridge.\r\n\r\nThe Germans labored up the glacis slowly at the most exposed places;\r\nnow crawling on their bellies, now creeping on hands and knees, but,\r\nin the main, moving with erect and steady bearing.  As they\r\napproached within short range, they suddenly found that the French\r\nartillery and mitrallleuses had by no means been silenced--about two\r\nhundred pieces opening on them with fearful effect, while at the same\r\ntime the whole crest blazed with a deadly fire from the Chassepot\r\nrifles.  Resistance like this was so unexpected by the Germans that\r\nit dismayed them; and first wavering a moment, then becoming\r\npanic-stricken, they broke and fled, infantry, cavalry, and artillery\r\ncoming down the slope without any pretence of formation, the French\r\nhotly following and pouring in a heavy and constant fire as the\r\nfugitives fled back across the ravine toward Gravelotte.  With this\r\nthe battle on the right had now assumed a most serious aspect, and\r\nthe indications were that the French would attack the heights of\r\nGravelotte; but the Pomeranian corps coming on the field at this\r\ncrisis, was led into action by Von Moltke, himself, and shortly after\r\nthe day was decided in favor of the Germans.\r\n\r\nWhen the French guns opened fire, it was discovered that the King's\r\nposition was within easy range, many of the shells falling near\r\nenough to make the place extremely uncomfortable; so it was suggested\r\nthat he go to a less exposed point.  At first he refused to listen to\r\nthis wise counsel, but yielded finally--leaving the ground with\r\nreluctance, however--and went back toward Rezonville.  I waited for\r\nCount Bismarck, who did not go immediately with the King, but\r\nremained at Gravelotte, looking after some of the escort who had been\r\nwounded.  When he had arranged for their care, we set out to rejoin\r\nthe King, and before going far, overtook his Majesty, who had stopped\r\non the Chalons road, and was surrounded by a throng of fugitives,\r\nwhom he was berating in German so energetic as to remind me forcibly\r\nof the \"Dutch\" swearing that I used to hear in my boyhood in Ohio.\r\nThe dressing down finished to his satisfaction, the King resumed his\r\ncourse toward Re'zonville, halting, however, to rebuke in the same\r\nemphatic style every group of runaways he overtook.\r\n\r\nPassing through Rezonville, we halted just beyond the village; there\r\na fire was built, and the King, his brother, Prince Frederick\r\nCharles, and Von Roon were provided with rather uncomfortable seats\r\nabout it, made by resting the ends of a short ladder on a couple of\r\nboxes.  With much anxiety and not a little depression of spirits news\r\nfrom the battle-field was now awaited, but the suspense did not last\r\nlong, for presently came the cheering intelligence that the French\r\nwere retiring, being forced back by the Pomeranian corps, and some of\r\nthe lately broken right wing organizations, that had been rallied on\r\nthe heights of Gravelotte.  The lost ground being thus regained, and\r\nthe French having been beaten on their right, it was not long before\r\nword came that Bazaine's army was falling back to Metz, leaving the\r\nentire battle-field in possession of the Germans.\r\n\r\nDuring the excitement of the day I had not much felt the want of\r\neither food or water, but now that all was over I was nearly\r\nexhausted, having had neither since early morning.  Indeed, all of\r\nthe party were in like straits; the immense armies had not only eaten\r\nup nearly everything in the country, but had drunk all the wells dry,\r\ntoo, and there seemed no relief for us till, luckily, a squad of\r\nsoldiers came along the road with a small cask of wine in a cart.\r\nOne of the staff-officers instantly appropriated the keg, and\r\nproceeded to share his prize most generously.  Never had I tasted\r\nanything so refreshing and delicious, but as the wine was the\r\nordinary sour stuff drunk by the peasantry of northern France, my\r\nappreciation must be ascribed to my famished condition rather than to\r\nany virtues of the beverage itself.\r\n\r\nAfter I had thus quenched my thirst the King's, brother called me\r\naside, and drawing from his coat-tail pocket a piece of stale black\r\nbread, divided it with me, and while munching on this the Prince\r\nbegan talking of his son--General Prince Frederick Charles, popularly\r\ncalled the Red Prince--who was in command of the Second Army in this\r\nbattle--the German left wing.  In recounting his son's professional\r\ncareer the old man's face was aglow with enthusiasm, and not without\r\ngood cause, for in the war between Prussia and Austria in 1866, as\r\nwell as in the present campaign, the Red Prince had displayed the\r\nhighest order of military genius.\r\n\r\nThe headquarters now became the scene of much bustle, despatches\r\nannouncing the victory being sent in all directions.  The first one\r\ntransmitted was to the Queen, the King directing Count Bismarck to\r\nprepare it for his signature; then followed others of a more official\r\ncharacter, and while these matters were being attended to I thought I\r\nwould ride into the village to find, if possible, some water for my\r\nhorse.  Just as I entered the chief street, however, I was suddenly\r\nhalted by a squad of soldiers, who, taking me for a French officer\r\n(my coat and forage cap resembling those of the French), leveled\r\ntheir pieces at me.  They were greatly excited, so much so, indeed,\r\nthat I thought my hour had come, for they could not understand\r\nEnglish, and I could not speak German, and dare not utter\r\nexplanations in French.  Fortunately a few disconnected German words\r\ncame to me in the emergency.  With these I managed to delay my\r\nexecution, and one of the party ventured to come up to examine the\r\n\"suspect\" more closely.  The first thing he did was to take off my\r\ncap, and looking it over carefully, his eyes rested on the three\r\nstars above the visor, and, pointing to them, he emphatically\r\npronounced me French.  Then of course they all became excited again,\r\nmore so than before, even, for they thought I was trying to practice\r\na ruse, and I question whether I should have lived to recount the\r\nadventure had not an officer belonging to the King's headquarters\r\nbeen passing by just then, when, hearing the threatenings and\r\nimprecations, he rode up to learn the cause of the hubbub, and\r\nimmediately recognized and released me.  When he told my wrathy\r\ncaptors who I was, they were much mortified of course, and made the\r\nmost profuse apologies, promising that no such mistake should occur\r\nagain, and so on; but not feeling wholly reassured, for my uniform\r\nwas still liable to mislead, I was careful to return to headquarters\r\nin company with my deliverer.  There I related what had occurred, and\r\nafter a good laugh all round, the King provided me with a pass which\r\nhe said would preclude any such mishap in the future, and would also\r\npermit me to go wherever I pleased--a favor rarely bestowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nSEARCHING FOR QUARTERS--HUNTING UP PROVISIONS--A SLENDER BREAKFAST\r\n--GOING OVER THE BATTLEFIELD--THE GERMAN ARTILLERY--A GROUP OF WOUNDED\r\n--DINING WITH THE KING--ON THE MARCH--THE BAVARIANS--KIRSCHWASSER\r\n--URGING ON THE TROOPS.\r\n\r\nWhile I was absent, as related in the preceding chapter, it had been\r\ndecided that the King's quarters should be established for the night\r\nin the village of Rezonville; and as it would be very difficult, at\r\nsuch a late hour, to billet the whole party regularly, Count Bismarck\r\nand I went off to look for shelter for ourselves.  Remembering that I\r\nhad seen, when seeking to water my horse, a partly burned barn with\r\nsome fresh-looking hay in it, I suggested that we lodge there.  He\r\ntoo thought it would answer our purpose, but on reaching it we found\r\nthe unburned part of the barn filled with wounded, and this\r\nnecessitating a further search we continued on through the village in\r\nquest of some house not yet converted into a hospital.  Such,\r\nhowever, seemed impossible to come upon, so at last the Count fixed\r\non one whose upper floor, we learned, was unoccupied, though the\r\nlower one was covered with wounded.\r\n\r\nMounting a creaky ladder--there was no stairway--to the upper story,\r\nwe found a good-sized room with three large beds, one of which the\r\nChancellor assigned to the Duke of Mecklenburg and aide, and another\r\nto Count Bismarck-Bohlen and me, reserving the remaining one for\r\nhimself.  Each bed, as is common in Germany and northern France, was\r\nprovided with a feather tick, but the night being warm, these spreads\r\nwere thrown off, and discovering that they would make a comfortable\r\nshakedown on the floor, I slept there leaving Bismarck-Bohlen\r\nunembarrassed by companionship--at least of a human kind.\r\n\r\nAt daylight I awoke, and seeing that Count Bismarck was already\r\ndressed and about to go down the ladder, I felt obliged to follow his\r\nexample, so I too turned out, and shortly descended to the\r\nground-floor, the only delays of the toilet being those incident to\r\ndressing, for there were no conveniences for morning ablutions.  Just\r\noutside the door I met the Count, who, proudly exhibiting a couple of\r\neggs he had bought from the woman of the house, invited me to\r\nbreakfast with him, provided we could beg some coffee from the king's\r\nescort.  Putting the eggs under my charge, with many injunctions as\r\nto their safe-keeping, he went off to forage for the coffee, and\r\npresently returned, having been moderately successful.  One egg\r\napiece was hardly enough, however, to appease the craving of two\r\nstrong men ravenous from long fasting.  Indeed, it seemed only to\r\nwhet the appetite, and we both set out on an eager expedition for\r\nmore food.  Before going far I had the good luck to meet a sutler's\r\nwagon, and though its stock was about all sold, there were still left\r\nfour large bologna sausages, which I promptly purchased--paying a\r\nround sum for them too--and hastening back found the Count already\r\nreturned, though without bringing anything at all to eat; but he had\r\nsecured a couple of bottles of brandy, and with a little of this--it\r\nwas excellent, too--and the sausages, the slim ration of eggs and\r\ncoffee was amply reinforced.\r\n\r\nBreakfast over, the Chancellor invited me to accompany him in a ride\r\nto the battle-field, and I gladly accepted, as I very much desired to\r\npass over the ground in front of Gravelotte, particularly so to see\r\nwhether the Krupp guns had really done the execution that was claimed\r\nfor them by the German artillery officers.  Going directly through\r\nthe village of Gravelotte, following the causeway over which the\r\nGerman cavalry had passed to make its courageous but futile charge,\r\nwe soon reached the ground where the fighting had been the most\r\nsevere.  Here the field was literally covered with evidences of the\r\nterrible strife, the dead and wounded strewn thick on every side.\r\n\r\nIn the sunken road the carnage had been awful; men and horses having\r\nbeen slaughtered there by hundreds, helpless before the murderous\r\nfire delivered from behind a high stone wall impracticable to mounted\r\ntroops.  The sight was sickening to an extreme, and we were not slow\r\nto direct our course elsewhere, going up the glacis toward the French\r\nline, the open ground over which we crossed being covered with\r\nthousands of helmets, that had been thrown off by the Germans during\r\nthe fight and were still dotting the field, though details of\r\nsoldiers from the organizations which had been engaged here were\r\nabout to begin to gather up their abandoned headgear.\r\n\r\nWhen we got inside the French works, I was astonished to observe how\r\nlittle harm had been done the defenses by the German artillery, for\r\nalthough I had not that serene faith in the effectiveness of their\r\nguns held by German artillerists generally, yet I thought their\r\nterrific cannonade must have left marked results.  All I could\r\nperceive, however, was a disabled gun, a broken mitrailleuse, and two\r\nbadly damaged caissons.\r\n\r\nEverything else, except a little ammunition in the trenches, had been\r\ncarried away, and it was plain to see, from the good shape in which\r\nthe French left wing had retired to Metz, that its retreat had been\r\npredetermined by the disasters to the right wing.\r\n\r\nBy this hour the German cavalry having been thrown out to the front\r\nwell over toward Metz, we, following it to get a look at the city,\r\nrode to a neighboring summit, supposing it would be a safe point of\r\nobservation; but we shortly realized the contrary, for scarcely had\r\nwe reached the crest when some of the French pickets, lying concealed\r\nabout six hundred yards off, opened fire, making it so very hot for\r\nus that, hugging the necks of our horses, we incontinently fled.\r\nObserving what had taken place, a troop of German cavalry charged the\r\nFrench outpost and drove it far enough away to make safe our return,\r\nand we resumed possession of the point, but only to discover that the\r\ncountry to the east was so broken and hilly that no satisfactory view\r\nof Metz could be had.\r\n\r\nReturning to Gravelotte, we next visited that part of the battlefield\r\nto the northeast of the village, and before long Count Bismarck\r\ndiscovered in a remote place about twenty men dreadfully wounded.\r\nThese poor fellows had had no attention whatever, having been\r\noverlooked by the hospital corps, and their condition was most\r\npitiful.  Yet there was one very handsome man in the group--a captain\r\nof artillery--who, though shot through the right breast, was\r\ntalkative and cheerful, and felt sure of getting well.  Pointing,\r\nhowever, to a comrade lying near, also shot in the breast, he\r\nsignificantly shook his head; it was easy to see on this man's face\r\nthe signs--of fast approaching death.\r\n\r\nAn orderly was at once despatched for a surgeon, Bismarck and I doing\r\nwhat we could meanwhile to alleviate the intense sufferings of the\r\nmaimed men, bringing them water and administering a little brandy,\r\nfor the Count still had with him some of the morning's supply.  When\r\nthe surgeons came, we transferred the wounded to their care, and\r\nmaking our way to Rezonville, there took the Count's carriage to\r\nrejoin the King's headquarters, which in the mean time had been moved\r\nto Pont-a-Mousson.  Our route led through the village of Gorze, and\r\nhere we found the streets so obstructed with wagons that I feared it\r\nwould take us the rest of the day to get through, for the teamsters\r\nwould not pay the slightest heed to the cries of our postilions.  The\r\nCount was equal to the emergency, however, for, taking a pistol from\r\nbehind his cushion, and bidding me keep my seat, he jumped out and\r\nquickly began to clear the street effectively, ordering wagons to the\r\nright and left.  Marching in front of the carriage and making way for\r\nus till we were well through the blockade, he then resumed his seat,\r\nremarking, \"This is not a very dignified business for the Chancellor\r\nof the German Confederation, but it's the only way to get through.\"\r\n\r\nAt Pont-a-Mousson I was rejoined by my aide, General Forsyth, and for\r\nthe next two days our attention was almost wholly devoted to securing\r\nmeans of transportation.  This was most difficult to obtain, but as I\r\ndid not wish to impose on the kindness of the Chancellor longer, we\r\npersevered till, finally, with the help of Count Bismarck-Bohlen, we\r\nmanaged to get tolerably well equipped with a saddle-horse apiece,\r\nand a two-horse carriage.  Here also, on the afternoon of August 21,\r\nI had the pleasure of dining with the King.  The dinner was a simple\r\none, consisting of soup, a joint, and two or three vegetables; the\r\nwines vin ordinaire and Burgundy.  There were a good many persons of\r\nhigh rank present, none of whom spoke English, however, except\r\nBismarck, who sat next the King and acted as interpreter when his\r\nMajesty conversed with me.  Little was said of the events taking\r\nplace around us, but the King made many inquiries concerning the war\r\nof the rebellion, particularly with reference to Grant's campaign at\r\nVicksburg; suggested, perhaps, by the fact that there, and in the\r\nrecent movements of the German army, had been applied many similar\r\nprinciples of military science.\r\n\r\nThe French army under Marshal Bazaine having retired into the\r\nfortifications of Metz, that stronghold was speedily invested by\r\nPrince Frederick Charles.  Meantime the Third Army, under the Crown\r\nPrince of Prussia--which, after having fought and won the battle of\r\nWorth, had been observing the army of Marshal MacMahon during and\r\nafter the battle of Gravelotte--was moving toward Paris by way of\r\nNancy, in conjunction with an army called the Fourth, which had been\r\norganized from the troops previously engaged around Metz, and on the\r\n22d was directed toward Bar-le-Duc under the command of the Crown\r\nPrince of Saxony.  In consequence of these operations the King\r\ndecided to move to Commercy, which place we reached by carriage,\r\ntraveling on a broad macadamized road lined on both sides with\r\npoplar-trees, and our course leading through a most beautiful country\r\nthickly dotted with prosperous-looking villages.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Commercy, Forsyth and I found that quarters had been\r\nalready selected for us, and our names written on the door with chalk\r\nthe quartermaster charged with the billeting of the officers at\r\nheadquarters having started out in advance to perform this duty and\r\nmake all needful preparations for the King before he arrived, which\r\ncourse was usually pursued thereafter, whenever the royal\r\nheadquarters took up a new location.\r\n\r\nForsyth and I were lodged with the notary of the village, who over\r\nand over again referred to his good fortune in not having to\r\nentertain any of the Germans.  He treated us most hospitably, and\r\nnext morning,  on departing, we offered compensation by tendering a\r\nsum--about what our bill would have been at a good hotel--to be used\r\nfor the \"benefit of the wounded or the Church.\"  Under this\r\nstipulation the notary accepted, and we followed that plan of paying\r\nfor food and lodging afterward, whenever quartered in private houses.\r\n\r\nThe next day I set out in advance of the headquarters, and reached\r\nBar-le-Duc about noon, passing on the way the Bavarian contingent of\r\nthe Crown Prince's army.  These Bavarians were trim-looking soldiers,\r\ndressed in neat uniforms of light blue; they looked healthy and\r\nstrong, but seemed of shorter stature than the North Germans I had\r\nseen in the armies of Prince Frederick Charles and General von\r\nSteinmetz.  When, later in the day the King arrived, a guard for him\r\nwas detailed from this Bavarian contingent; a stroke of policy no\r\ndoubt, for the South Germans were so prejudiced against their\r\nbrothers of the North that no opportunity to smooth them down was\r\npermitted to go unimproved.\r\n\r\nBar-le-Duc, which had then a population of about 15,000, is one of\r\nthe prettiest towns I saw in France, its quaint and ancient buildings\r\nand beautiful boulevards charming the eye as well as exciting deep\r\ninterest.  The King and his immediate suite were quartered on one of\r\nthe best boulevards in a large building--the Bank of France--the\r\nbalcony of which offered a fine opportunity to observe a part of the\r\narmy of the Crown Prince the next day on its march toward Vitry.\r\nThis was the first time his Majesty had had a chance to see any of\r\nthese troops--as hitherto he had accompanied either the army of\r\nPrince Frederick Charles, or that of General Steinmetz--and the\r\ncheers with which he was greeted by the Bavarians left no room for\r\ndoubting their loyalty to the Confederation, notwithstanding ancient\r\njealousies.\r\n\r\nWhile the troops were passing, Count Bismarck had the kindness to\r\npoint out to me the different organizations, giving scraps of their\r\nhistory, and also speaking concerning the qualifications of the\r\ndifferent generals commanding them.  When the review was over we went\r\nto the Count's house, and there, for the first time in my life, I\r\ntasted kirschwasser, a very strong liquor distilled from cherries.\r\nNot knowing anything about the stuff, I had to depend on Bismarck's\r\nrecommendation, and he proclaiming it fine, I took quite a generous\r\ndrink, which nearly strangled me and brought on a violent fit of\r\ncoughing.  The Chancellor said, however, that this was in no way due\r\nto the liquor, but to my own inexperience, and I was bound to believe\r\nthe distinguished statesman, for he proved his words by swallowing a\r\ngoodly dose with an undisturbed and even beaming countenance,\r\ndemonstrating his assertion so forcibly that I forthwith set out with\r\nBismarck-Bohlen to lay in a supply for myself.\r\n\r\nI spent the night in a handsome house, the property of an\r\nexceptionally kind and polite gentleman bearing the indisputably\r\nGerman name of Lager, but who was nevertheless French from head to\r\nfoot, if intense hatred of the Prussians be a sign of Gallic\r\nnationality.  At daybreak on the 26th word came for us to be ready to\r\nmove by the Chalons road at 7 o'clock, but before we got off, the\r\norder was suspended till 2 in the afternoon.  In the interval General\r\nvon Moltke arrived and held a long conference with the King, and when\r\nwe did pull out we traveled the remainder of the afternoon in company\r\nwith a part of the Crown Prince's army, which after this conference\r\ninaugurated the series of movements from Bar-le-Duc northward, that\r\nfinally compelled the surrender at Sedan.  This sudden change of\r\ndirection I did not at first understand, but soon learned that it was\r\nbecause of the movements of Marshal MacMahon, who, having united the\r\nFrench army beaten at Worth with three fresh corps at Chalons, was\r\nmarching to relieve Metz in obedience to orders from the Minister of\r\nWar at Paris.\r\n\r\nAs we passed along the column, we noticed that the Crown Prince's\r\ntroops were doing their best, the officers urging the men to their\r\nutmost exertions, persuading weary laggards and driving up\r\nstragglers.  As a general thing, however, they marched in good shape,\r\nnotwithstanding the rapid gait and the trying heat, for at the outset\r\nof the campaign the Prince had divested them of all impedimenta\r\nexcept essentials, and they were therefore in excellent trim for a\r\nforced march.\r\n\r\nThe King traveled further than usual that day--to Clermont--so we did\r\nnot get shelter till late, and even then not without some confusion,\r\nfor the quartermaster having set out toward Chalons before the change\r\nof programme was ordered, was not at hand to provide for us.  I had\r\nextreme good luck, though, in being quartered with a certain\r\napothecary, who, having lived for a time in the United States,\r\nclaimed it as a privilege even to lodge me, and certainly made me his\r\ndebtor for the most generous hospitality.  It was not so with some of\r\nthe others, however; and Count Bismarck was particularly unfortunate,\r\nbeing billeted in a very small and uncomfortable house, where,\r\nvisiting him to learn more fully what was going on, I found him,\r\nwrapped in a shabby old dressing-gown, hard at work.  He was\r\nestablished in a very small room, whose only furnishings consisted of\r\na table--at which he was writing--a couple of rough chairs, and the\r\nuniversal feather-bed, this time made on the floor in one corner of\r\nthe room.  On my remarking upon the limited character of his\r\nquarters, the Count replied, with great good-humor, that they were\r\nall right, and that he should get along well enough.  Even the tramp\r\nof his clerks in the attic, and the clanking of his orderlies' sabres\r\nbelow, did not disturb him much; he said, in fact, that he would have\r\nno grievance at all were it not for a guard of Bavarian soldiers\r\nstationed about the house for his safety, he presumed the sentinels\r\nfrom which insisted on protecting and saluting the Chancellor of the\r\nNorth German Confederation in and out of season, a proceeding that\r\nled to embarrassment sometimes, as he was much troubled with a severe\r\ndysentery.  Notwithstanding his trials, however, and in the midst of\r\nthe correspondence on which he was so intently engaged, he graciously\r\ntook time to explain that the sudden movement northward from\r\nBar-le-Duc was, as I have previously recounted, the result of\r\ninformation that Marshal MacMahon was endeavoring to relieve Metz by\r\nmarching along the Belgian frontier; \"a blundering manoeuvre,\" remarked\r\nthe Chancellor, \"which cannot be accounted for, unless it has been\r\nbrought about by the political situation of the French.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nAFTER MacMAHON--THE BATTLE AT BEAUMONT--THE FRENCH SURPRISED--THE\r\nMARCHING OF THE GERMAN SOLDIERS--THE BATTLE OF SEDAN--GALLANT CAVALRY\r\nCHARGES--DEFEAT OF THE FRENCH--THE SURRENDER OF NAPOLEON--BISMARCK\r\nAND THE KING--DECORATING THE SOLDIERS.\r\n\r\nAll night long the forced march of the army went on through Clermont,\r\nand when I turned out, just after daylight, the columns were still\r\npressing forward, the men looking tired and much bedraggled, as\r\nindeed they had reason to be, for from recent rains the roads were\r\nvery sloppy.  Notwithstanding this, however, the troops were pushed\r\nahead with all possible vigor to intercept MacMahon and force a\r\nbattle before he could withdraw from his faulty movement, for which\r\nit has since been ascertained he was not at all responsible.  Indeed,\r\nthose at the royal headquarters seemed to think of nothing else than\r\nto strike MacMahon, for, feeling pretty confident that Metz could not\r\nbe relieved, they manifested not the slightest anxiety on that score.\r\n\r\nBy 8 o'clock, the skies having cleared, the headquarters set out for\r\nGrand Pre', which place we reached early in the afternoon, and that\r\nevening I again had the pleasure of dining with the King.  The\r\nconversation at table was almost wholly devoted to the situation, of\r\ncourse, everybody expressing surprise at the manoeuvre of the French\r\nat this time, their march along the Belgian frontier being credited\r\nentirely to Napoleon.  Up to bed-time there was still much\r\nuncertainty as to the exact positions of the French, but next morning\r\nintelligence being received which denoted the probability of a\r\nbattle, we drove about ten miles, to Buzancy, and there mounting our\r\nhorses, rode to the front.\r\n\r\nThe French were posted not far from Buzancy in a strong position,\r\ntheir right resting near Stonne and the left extending over into the\r\nwoods beyond Beaumont.  About 10 o'clock the Crown Prince of Saxony\r\nadvanced against this line, and while a part of his army turned the\r\nFrench right, compelling it to fall back rapidly, the German centre\r\nand right attacked with great vigor and much skill, surprising one of\r\nthe divisions of General De Failly's corps while the men were in the\r\nact of cooking their breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe French fled precipitately, leaving behind their tents and other\r\ncamp equipage, and on inspecting the ground which they had abandoned\r\nso hastily, I noticed on all sides ample evidence that not even the\r\nmost ordinary precautions had been taken to secure the division from\r\nsurprise, The artillery horses had not been harnessed, and many of\r\nthem had been shot down at the picket-rope where they had been\r\nhaltered the night before, while numbers of men were lying dead with\r\nloaves of bread or other food instead of their muskets in their\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nSome three thousand prisoners and nearly all the artillery and\r\nmitrailleuses of the division--were captured, while the fugitives\r\nwere pursued till they found shelter behind--Douay's corps and the\r\nrest of De Failly's beyond Beaumont.  The same afternoon there were\r\nseveral other severe combats along the Meuse, but I had no chance of\r\nwitnessing any of them, and just before night-fall I started back to\r\nBuzancy, to which place the King's headquarters had been brought\r\nduring the day.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the 31st the King moved to Vendresse.  First sending\r\nour carriage back to Grand Pre' for our trunks, Forsyth and I mounted\r\nour horses and rode to the battle-field accompanied by an English\r\nnobleman, the Duke of Manchester.  The part of the field we traversed\r\nwas still thickly strewn with the dead of both armies, though all the\r\nwounded had been collected in the hospitals.  In the village of\r\nBeaumont, we stopped to take a look at several thousand French\r\nprisoners, whose worn clothing and evident dejection told that they\r\nhad been doing a deal of severe marching under great discouragements.\r\n\r\nThe King reached the village shortly after, and we all continued on\r\nto Chemery, just beyond where his Majesty alighted from his carriage\r\nto observe his son's troops file past as they came in from the\r\ndirection of Stonne.  This delay caused us to be as late as 9 o'clock\r\nbefore we got shelter that night, but as it afforded me the best\r\nopportunity I had yet had for seeing the German soldiers on the\r\nmarch, I did not begrudge the time.  They moved in a somewhat open\r\nand irregular column of fours, the intervals between files being\r\nespecially intended to give room for a peculiar swinging gait, with\r\nwhich the men seemed to urge themselves over the ground with ease and\r\nrapidity.  There was little or no straggling, and being strong, lusty\r\nyoung fellows, and lightly equipped--they carried only needle-guns,\r\nammunition, a very small knapsack, a water-bottle, and a haversack\r\n--they strode by with an elastic step, covering at least three miles an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nIt having been definitely ascertained that the demoralized French\r\nwere retiring to Sedan, on the evening of August 31 the German army\r\nbegan the work of hemming them in there, so disposing the different\r\ncorps as to cover the ground from Donchery around by Raucourt to\r\nCarignan.  The next morning this line was to be drawn in closer on\r\nSedan; and the Crown Prince of Saxony was therefore ordered to take\r\nup a position to the north of Bazeilles, beyond the right bank of the\r\nMeuse, while the Crown Prince of Prussia was to cross his right wing\r\nover the Meuse at Remilly, to move on Bazeilles, his centre meantime\r\nmarching against a number of little hamlets still held by the French\r\nbetween there and Donchery.  At this last-mentioned place strong\r\nreserves were to be held, and from it the Eleventh Corps, followed by\r\nthe Fifth and a division of cavalry, was to march on St. Menges.\r\n\r\nForsyth and I started early next morning, September 1, and in a thick\r\nfog-which, however, subsequently gave place to bright sunshine--we\r\ndrove to the village of Chevenges, where, mounting our horses, we\r\nrode in a northeasterly direction to the heights of Frenois and\r\nWadelincourt, bordering the river Meuse on the left bank, where from\r\nthe crest we had a good view of the town of Sedan with its circling\r\nfortifications, which, though extensive, were not so formidable as\r\nthose around Metz.  The King and his staff were already established\r\non these heights, and at a point so well chosen that his Majesty\r\ncould observe the movements of both armies immediately east and south\r\nof Sedan, and also to the northwest toward Floing and the Belgian\r\nfrontier.\r\n\r\nThe battle was begun to the east and northeast of Sedan as early as\r\nhalf-past 4 o'clock by the German right wing--the fighting being\r\ndesultory--and near the same hour the Bavarians attacked Bazeilles.\r\nThis village, some two miles southeast of Sedan, being of importance,\r\nwas defended with great obstinacy, the French contesting from street\r\nto street and house to house the attack of the Bavarians till near\r\n10 o'clock, when, almost every building being knocked to pieces, they\r\nwere compelled to relinquish the place.  The possession of this\r\nvillage gave the Germans to the east of Sedan a continuous line,\r\nextending from the Meuse northward through La Moncelle and Daigny to\r\nGivonne, and almost to the Belgian frontier.\r\n\r\nWhile the German centre and right were thus engaged, the left had\r\nmoved in accordance with the prescribed plan.  Indeed, some of these\r\ntroops had crossed the Meuse the night before, and now, at a little\r\nafter 6 o'clock, their advance could be seen just north of the\r\nvillage of Floing.  Thus far these columns, under the immediate eye\r\nof the Crown Prince of Prussia, had met with no opposition to their\r\nmarch, and as soon as they got to the high ground above the village\r\nthey began extending to the east, to connect with the Army of the\r\nMeuse.  This juncture was effected at Illy without difficulty, and\r\nthe French army was now completely encompassed.\r\n\r\nAfter a severe fight, the Crown Prince drove the French through\r\nFloing, and as the ground between this village and Sedan is an\r\nundulating open plain, everywhere visible, there was then offered a\r\nrare opportunity for seeing the final conflict preceding the\r\nsurrender.  Presently up out of the little valley where Floing is\r\nlocated came the Germans, deploying just on the rim of the plateau a\r\nvery heavy skirmish-line, supported by a line of battle at close\r\ndistance.  When these skirmishers appeared, the French infantry had\r\nwithdrawn within its intrenched lines, but a strong body of their\r\ncavalry, already formed in a depression to the right of the Floing\r\nroad, now rode at the Germans in gallant style, going clear through\r\nthe dispersed skirmishers to the main line of battle.  Here the\r\nslaughter of the French was awful, for in addition to the deadly\r\nvolleys from the solid battalions of their enemies, the skirmishers,\r\nwho had rallied in knots at advantageous places, were now delivering\r\na severe and effective fire.  The gallant horsemen, therefore, had to\r\nretire precipitately, but re-forming in the depression, they again\r\nundertook the hopeless task of breaking the German infantry, making\r\nin all four successive charges.  Their ardor and pluck were of no\r\navail, however, for the Germans, growing stronger every minute by the\r\naccession of troops from Floing, met the fourth attack in such large\r\nforce that, even before coming in contact with their adversaries, the\r\nFrench broke and retreated to the protection of the intrenchments,\r\nwhere, from the beginning of the combat, had been lying plenty of\r\nidle infantry, some of which at least, it seemed plain to me, ought\r\nto have been thrown into the fight.  This action was the last one of\r\nconsequence around Sedan, for, though with the contraction of the\r\nGerman lines their batteries kept cannonading more or less, and the\r\nrattle of musketry continued to be heard here and there, yet the hard\r\nfighting of the day practically ended on the plateau of Floing.\r\n\r\nBy 3 o'clock, the French being in a desperate and hopeless situation,\r\nthe King ordered the firing to be stopped, and at once despatched one\r\nof his staff--Colonel von Bronsart--with a demand for a surrender.\r\nJust as this officer was starting off, I remarked to Bismarck that\r\nNapoleon himself would likely be one of the prizes, but the Count,\r\nincredulous, replied, \"Oh no; the old fox is too cunning to be caught\r\nin such a trap; he has doubtless slipped off to Paris\"--a belief\r\nwhich I found to prevail pretty generally about headquarters.\r\n\r\nIn the lull that succeeded, the King invited many of those about him\r\nto luncheon, a caterer having provided from some source or other a\r\nsubstantial meal of good bread, chops and peas, with a bountiful\r\nsupply of red and sherry wines.  Among those present were Prince\r\nCarl, Bismarck, Von Moltke, Von Roon, the Duke of Weimar, the Duke of\r\nCoburg, the Grand-Duke of Mecklenburg, Count Hatzfeldt, Colonel\r\nWalker, of the English army, General Forsyth, and I.  The King was\r\nagreeable and gracious at all times, but on this occasion he was\r\nparticularly so, being naturally in a happy frame of mind because\r\nthis day the war had reached a crisis which presaged for the near\r\nfuture the complete vanquishment of the French.\r\n\r\nBetween 4 and 5 o'clock Colonel von Bronsart returned from his\r\nmission to Sedan, bringing word to the King that the commanding\r\nofficer there General Wimpffen, wished to know, in order that the\r\nfurther effusion of blood might be spared, upon what terms he might\r\nsurrender.  The Colonel brought the intelligence also that the French\r\nEmperor was in the town.  Soon after Von Bronsart's arrival a French\r\nofficer approached from Sedan, preceded by a white flag and two\r\nGerman officers.  Coming up the road till within a few hundred yards\r\nof us, they halted; then one of the Germans rode forward to say that\r\nthe French officer was Napoleon's adjutant, bearing an autograph\r\nletter from the Emperor to the King of Prussia.  At this the King,\r\nfollowed by Bismarck, Von Moltke, and Von Roon, walked out to the\r\nfront a little distance and halted, his Majesty still in advance, the\r\nrest of us meanwhile forming in a line some twenty paces to the rear\r\nof the group.  The envoy then approached, at first on horseback, but\r\nwhen within about a hundred yards he dismounted, and uncovering, came\r\nthe remaining distance on foot, bearing high up in his right hand the\r\ndespatch from Napoleon.  The bearer proved to be General Reille, and\r\nas he handed the Emperor's letter to the King, his Majesty saluted\r\nhim with the utmost formality and precision.  Napoleon's letter was\r\nthe since famous one, running so characteristically, thus: \"Not\r\nhaving been able to die in the midst of my troops, there is nothing\r\nleft me but to place my sword in your Majesty's hands.\" The reading\r\nfinished, the King returned to his former post, and after a\r\nconference with Bismarck, Von Moltke, and Von Roon, dictated an\r\nanswer accepting Napoleon's surrender, and requesting him to\r\ndesignate an officer with power to treat for the capitulation of the\r\narmy, himself naming Von Moltke to represent the Germans.  The King\r\nthen started for Vendresse, to pass the night.  It was after\r\n7 o'clock now, and hence too late to arrange anything more where we\r\nwere, so further negotiations were deferred till later in the\r\nevening; and I, wishing to be conveniently near Bismarck, resolved to\r\ntake up quarters in Donchery.  On our way thither we were met by the\r\nCount's nephew, who assuring us that it would be impossible to find\r\nshelter there in the village, as all the houses were filled with\r\nwounded, Forsyth and I decided to continue on to Chevenge.  On the\r\nother hand, Bismarck-Bohlen bore with him one great comfort--some\r\nexcellent brandy.  Offering the flask to his uncle, he said: \"You've\r\nhad a hard day of it; won't you refresh yourself?\"  The Chancellor,\r\nwithout wasting time to answer, raised the bottle to his lips,\r\nexclaiming: \"Here's to the unification of Germany!\" which sentiment\r\nthe gurgling of an astonishingly long drink seemed to emphasize.  The\r\nCount then handed the bottle back to his nephew, who, shaking it,\r\nejaculated, \"Why, we can't pledge you in return--there is nothing\r\nleft!\" to which came the waggish response, \"I beg pardon; it was so\r\ndark I couldn't see\"; nevertheless there was a little remaining, as I\r\nmyself can aver.\r\n\r\nHaving left our carriage at Chevenge, Forsyth and I stopped there to\r\nget it, but a long search proving fruitless, we took lodging in the\r\nvillage at the house of the cure, resolved to continue the hunt in\r\nthe morning.  But then we had no better success, so concluding that\r\nour vehicle had been pressed into the hospital service, we at an\r\nearly hour on the 2d of September resumed the search, continuing on\r\ndown the road in the direction of Sedan.  Near the gate of the city\r\nwe came on the German picket-line, and one of the Officers,\r\nrecognizing our uniforms--he having served in the war of the\r\nrebellion--stepped forward and addressed me in good English.  We\r\nnaturally fell into conversation, and in the midst of it there came\r\nout through the gate an open carriage, or landau, containing two men,\r\none of whom, in the uniform of a general and smoking a cigarette, we\r\nrecognized, when the conveyance drew near, as the Emperor Louis\r\nNapoleon.  The landau went on toward Donchery at a leisurely pace,\r\nand we, inferring that there was something more important at hand\r\njust then than the recovery of our trap, followed at a respectful\r\ndistance.  Not quite a mile from Donchery is a cluster of three or\r\nfour cottages, and at the first of these the landau stopped to await,\r\nas we afterward ascertained, Count Bismarck, with whom the diplomatic\r\nnegotiations were to be settled.  Some minutes elapsed before he\r\ncame, Napoleon remaining seated in his carriage meantime, still\r\nsmoking, and accepting with nonchalance the staring of a group of\r\nGerman soldiers near by, who were gazing on their fallen foe with\r\ncurious and eager interest.\r\n\r\nPresently a clattering of hoofs was heard, and looking toward the\r\nsound, I perceived the Chancellor cantering down the road.  When\r\nabreast of the carriage he dismounted, and walking up to it, saluted\r\nthe Emperor in a quick, brusque way that seemed to startle him.\r\nAfter a word or two, the party moved perhaps a hundred yards further\r\non, where they stopped opposite the weaver's cottage so famous from\r\nthat day.  This little house is on the east side of the Donchery\r\nroad, near its junction with that to Frenois, and stands about twenty\r\npaces back from the highway.  In front is a stone wall covered with\r\ncreeping vines, and from a gate in this wall runs to the front door a\r\npath, at this time bordered on both sides with potato vines.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor having alighted at the gate, he and Bismarck walked\r\ntogether along the narrow path and entered the cottage.  Reappearing\r\nin about a quarter of an hour, they came out and seated themselves in\r\nthe open air, the weaver having brought a couple of chairs.  Here\r\nthey engaged in an animated conversation, if much gesticulation is\r\nany indication.  The talk lasted fully an hour, Bismarck seeming to\r\ndo most of it, but at last he arose, saluted the Emperor, and strode\r\ndown the path toward his horse.  Seeing me standing near the gate, he\r\njoined me for a moment, and asked if I had noticed how the Emperor\r\nstarted when they first met, and I telling him that I had, he added,\r\n\"Well, it must have been due to my manners, not my words, for these\r\nwe're, 'I salute your Majesty just as I would my King.'\"  Then the\r\nChancellor continued to chat a few minutes longer, assuring me that\r\nnothing further was to be done there, and that we had better go to\r\nthe Chateau Bellevue, where, he said, the formal surrender was to\r\ntake place.  With this he rode off toward Vendresse to communicate\r\nwith his sovereign, and Forsyth and I made ready to go to the Chateau\r\nBellevue.\r\n\r\nBefore we set out, however, a number of officers of the King's suite\r\narrived at the weaver's cottage, and from them I gathered that there\r\nwere differences at the royal headquarters as to whether peace should\r\nbe made then at Sedan, or the war continued till the French capital\r\nwas taken.  I further heard that the military advisers of the King\r\nstrongly advocated an immediate move on Paris, while the Chancellor\r\nthought it best to make peace now, holding Alsace and Lorraine, and\r\ncompelling the payment of an enormous levy of money; and these rumors\r\nwere most likely correct, for I had often heard Bismarck say that\r\nFrance being the richest country in Europe, nothing could keep her\r\nquiet but effectually to empty her pockets; and besides this, he\r\nimpressed me as holding that it would be better policy to preserve\r\nthe Empire.\r\n\r\nOn our way to the chateau we fell in with a number of artillery\r\nofficers bringing up their guns hurriedly to post them closer in to\r\nthe beleaguered town on a specially advantageous ridge.  Inquiring\r\nthe cause of this move, we learned that General Wimpffen had not yet\r\nagreed to the terms of surrender; that it was thought he would not,\r\nand that they wanted to be prepared for any such contingency.  And\r\nthey were preparing with a vengeance too, for I counted seventy-two\r\nKrupp guns in one continuous line trained on the Chateau Bellevue and\r\nSedan.\r\n\r\nNapoleon went directly from the weaver's to the Chateau Bellevue, and\r\nabout 10 o'clock the King of Prussia arrived from Frenois,\r\naccompanied by a few of his own suite and the Crown Prince with\r\nseveral members of his staff; and Von Moltke and Wimpffen having\r\nsettled their points of difference before the two monarchs met,\r\nwithin the next half-hour the articles of capitulation were formally\r\nsigned.\r\n\r\nOn the completion of the surrender--the occasion being justly\r\nconsidered a great one--the Crown Prince proceeded to distribute\r\namong the officers congregated in the chateau grounds 'the order of\r\nthe Iron Cross'--a generous supply of these decorations being carried\r\nin a basket by one of his orderlies, following him about as he walked\r\nalong.  Meantime the King, leaving Napoleon in the chateau to\r\nruminate on the fickleness of fortune, drove off to see his own\r\nvictorious soldiers, who greeted him with huzzas that rent the air,\r\nand must have added to the pangs of the captive Emperor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nRIDING OVER THE BATTLEFIELD--DESTRUCTION OF BAZEILLES--MISTAKES OF\r\nTHE FRENCH--MARSHAL BAZAINE ON TO PARIS--A WEEK IN MEAUX--RHEIMS--ON\r\nTHE PICKETLINE-UNDER FIRE--A SURRENDER--AT VERSAILLES--GENERAL\r\nBURNSIDE AND Mr. FORBES IN PARIS.\r\n\r\nThe Crown Prince having got to the bottom of his medal basket-that is\r\nto say, having finished his liberal distribution of decorations to\r\nhis officers--Forsyth and I rode off by way of Wadelincourt to\r\nBazeilles to see what had taken place on that part of the field, and\r\nthe sight that met our eyes as we entered the village was truly\r\ndreadful to look upon.  Most of the houses had been knocked down or\r\nburned the day before, but such as had been left standing were now in\r\nflames, the torch having been applied because, as it was claimed,\r\nFrenchmen concealed in them had fired on the wounded.  The streets\r\nwere still encumbered with both German and French dead, and it was\r\nevident that of those killed in the houses the bodies had not been\r\nremoved, for the air was loaded with odors of burning flesh.  From\r\nBazeille we rode on toward the north about two miles, along where the\r\nfight had been largely an artillery duel, to learn what we could of\r\nthe effectiveness of the Krupp gun.  Counting all the French dead we\r\ncame across killed by artillery, they figured up about three hundred\r\n--a ridiculously small number; in fact, not much more than one dead\r\nman for each Krupp gun on that part of the line.  Although the number\r\nof dead was in utter disproportion to the terrific six-hour\r\ncannonade, yet small as it was the torn and mangled bodies made such\r\na horrible sight that we turned back toward Bazeilles without having\r\ngone further than Givonne.\r\n\r\nAt Bazeilles we met the King, accompanied by Bismarck and several of\r\nthe staff.  They too had been riding over the field, the King making\r\nthis a practice, to see that the wounded were not neglected.  As I\r\ndrew up by the party, Bismarck accosted me with, \"Well, General,\r\naren't you hungry?  This is just the place to whet one's appetite\r\n--these burning Frenchmen--Ugh!\" and shrugging his shoulders in evident\r\ndisgust, he turned away to join his Majesty in further explorations,\r\nForsyth and I continuing on to Chevenges.  Here we got the first\r\ninkling of what had become of our carriage since leaving it two days\r\nbefore: it had been pressed into service to carry wounded officers from\r\nthe field during the battle, but afterward released, and was now safe\r\nat the house in Vendresse where we had been quartered the night of the\r\n31st, so, on hearing this, we settled to go there again to lodge, but\r\nour good friend, the cure', insisting that we should stay with him, we\r\nremained in Chevenges till next morning.\r\n\r\nOn September 3 the King removed from Vendresse to Rethel, where he\r\nremained two days; in the mean while the Germans, 240,000 strong,\r\nbeginning their direct march to Paris.  The French had little with\r\nwhich to oppose this enormous force, not more, perhaps, than 50,000\r\nregular troops; the rest of their splendid army had been lost or\r\ncaptured in battle, or was cooped up in the fortifications of Metz,\r\nStrasburg, and other places, in consequence of blunders without\r\nparallel in history, for which Napoleon and the Regency in Paris must\r\nbe held accountable.  The first of these gross faults was the fight\r\nat Worth, where MacMahon, before his army was mobilized, accepted\r\nbattle with the Crown Prince, pitting 50,000 men against 175,000; the\r\nnext was Bazaine's fixing upon Metz as his base, and stupidly putting\r\nhimself in position to be driven back to it, when there was no\r\npossible obstacle to his joining forces with MacMahon at Chalons;\r\nwhile the third and greatest blunder of all was MacMahon's move to\r\nrelieve Metz, trying to slip 140,000 men along the Belgian frontier.\r\nIndeed, it is exasperating and sickening to think of all this; to\r\nthink that Bazaine carried into Metz--a place that should have been\r\nheld, if at all, with not over 25,000 men--an army of 180,000,\r\nbecause it contained, the excuse was, \"an accumulation of stores.\"\r\nWith all the resources of rich France to draw upon, I cannot conceive\r\nthat this excuse was sincere; on the contrary, I think that the\r\nmovement of Bazaine must have been inspired by Napoleon with a view\r\nto the maintenance of his dynasty rather than for the good of France.\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, Bismarck did not approve of the German army's\r\nmoving on Paris after the battle of Sedan.  Indeed, I think he\r\nforesaw and dreaded the establishment of a Republic, his idea being\r\nthat if peace was made then, the Empire could be continued in the\r\nperson of the Prince Imperial who--, coming to the throne under\r\nGerman influences, would be pliable in his hands.  These views found\r\nfrequent expression in private, and in public too; I myself\r\nparticularly remember the Chancellor's speaking thus most unguardedly\r\nat a dinner in Rheims.  But he could not prevent the march to Paris;\r\nit was impossible to stop the Germans, flushed with success.  \"On to\r\nParis\" was written by the soldiers on every door, and every\r\nfence-board along the route to the capital, and the thought of a\r\ntriumphant march down the Champs Elysees was uppermost with every\r\nGerman, from the highest to the lowest grade.\r\n\r\nThe 5th of September we set out for Rheims.  There it was said the\r\nGermans would meet with strong resistance, for the French intended to\r\ndie to the last man before giving up that city.  But this proved all\r\nfudge, as is usual with these \"last ditch\" promises, the garrison\r\ndecamping immediately at the approach of a few Uhlans.  So far as I\r\ncould learn, but a single casualty happened; this occurred to an\r\nUhlan, wounded by a shot which it was reported was fired from a house\r\nafter the town was taken; so, to punish this breach of faith, a levy\r\nof several hundred bottles of champagne was made, and the wine\r\ndivided about headquarters, being the only seizure made in the city,\r\nI believe, for though Rheims, the centre of the champagne district,\r\nhad its cellars well stocked, yet most of them being owned by German\r\nfirms, they received every protection.\r\n\r\nThe land about Rheims is of a white, chalky character, and very poor,\r\nbut having been terraced and enriched with fertilizers, it produces\r\nthe champagne grape in such abundance that the region, once\r\nconsidered valueless, and named by the peasantry the \"land of the\r\nlouse,\" now supports a dense population.  We remained in Rheims eight\r\ndays, and through the politeness of the American Consul--Mr. Adolph\r\nGill--had the pleasure of seeing all the famous wine cellars, and\r\ninspecting the processes followed in champagne making, from the step\r\nof pressing the juice from the grape to that which shows the wine\r\nready for the market.  Mr. Gill also took us to see everything else\r\nof special interest about the city, and there being much to look at\r\n--fine old churches, ancient fortifications, a Roman gateway, etc.\r\n--the days slipped by very quickly, though the incessant rains\r\nsomewhat interfered with our enjoyment.\r\n\r\nFor three or four days all sorts of rumors were rife as to what was\r\ndoing in Paris, but nothing definite was learned till about the 9th;\r\nthen Count Bismarck informed me that the Regency had been overthrown\r\non the 4th, and that the Empress Eugenie had escaped to Belgium.  The\r\nKing of Prussia offered her an asylum with the Emperor at\r\nWilhelmshohe, \"where she ought to go,\" said the Chancellor, \"for her\r\nproper place is with her husband,\" but he feared she would not.  On\r\nthe same occasion he also told me that Jules Favre--the head of the\r\nProvisional Government--had sent him the suggestion that, the Empire\r\nbeing gone, peace should be made and the Germans withdrawn, but that\r\nhe (Bismarck) was now compelled to recognize the impossibility of\r\ndoing this till Paris was taken, for although immediately after the\r\nsurrender of Sedan he desired peace, the past few days had made it\r\nplain that the troops would not be satisfied with anything short of\r\nParis, no matter what form of Government the French should ultimately\r\nadopt.\r\n\r\nThe German army having met with no resistance whatever in its march\r\non Paris, its advance approached the capital rapidly, and by the 14th\r\nof September the royal headquarters moved by a fine macadamized road\r\nto the Chateau Thierry, and on the 5th reached Meaux, about\r\ntwenty-eight miles from Paris, where we remained four days awaiting the\r\nreconstruction of some railroad and canal bridges.  The town of Meaux\r\nhas a busy population of about 10,000 souls, in peaceable times\r\nprincipally occupied in manufacturing flour for the Paris market,\r\nhaving a fine waterpower for the many mills.  These were kept going day\r\nand night to supply the German army; and it was strange to see with\r\nwhat zeal Frenchmen toiled to fill the stomachs of their inveterate\r\nenemies, and with what alacrity the mayor and other officials filled\r\nrequisitions for wine, cheese, suits of livery, riding-whips, and even\r\nsquab pigeons.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay at Meaux the British Minister Lord Lyons, endeavored\r\nto bring about a cessation of hostilities, to this end sending his\r\nsecretary out from Paris with a letter to Count Bismarck, offering to\r\nserve as mediator.  The Chancellor would not agree to this, however,\r\nfor he conjectured that the action of the British Minister had been\r\ninspired by Jules Favre, who, he thought, was trying to draw the\r\nGermans into negotiations through the medium of a third party only\r\nfor purposes of delay.  So the next morning Lord Lyons's secretary,\r\nMr. Edward Malet, returned to Paris empty-handed, except that he bore\r\na communication positively declining mediation; which message,\r\nhowever, led no doubt to an interview between Bismarck and Favre a\r\ncouple of days later.\r\n\r\nThe forenoon of September 19 the King removed to the Chateau\r\nFerrieres--a castle belonging to the Rothschild family, where\r\nNapoleon had spent many happy days in the time of his prosperity.\r\nHis Majesty took up his quarters here at the suggestion of the owner,\r\nwe were told, so that by the presence of the King the magnificent\r\nchateau and its treasures of art would be unquestionably protected\r\nfrom all acts of vandalism.\r\n\r\nAll of the people at headquarters except the King's immediate suite\r\nwere assigned quarters at Lagny; and while Forsyth and I, accompanied\r\nby Sir Henry Havelock, of the British army, were driving thither, we\r\npassed on the road the representative of the National Defense\r\nGovernment, Jules Favre, in a carriage heading toward Meaux.\r\nPreceded by a flag of truce and accompanied by a single, companion,\r\nhe was searching for Count Bismarck, in conformity, doubtless, with\r\nthe message the Chancellor had sent to Paris on the 17th by the\r\nBritish secretary.  A half-mile further on we met Bismarck.  He too\r\nwas traveling toward Meaux, not in the best of humor either, it\r\nappeared, for having missed finding the French envoy at the\r\nrendezvous where they had agreed to meet, he stopped long enough to\r\nsay that the \"air was full of lies, and that there were many persons\r\nwith the army bent on business that did not concern them.\"\r\n\r\nThe armies of the two Crown Princes were now at the outskirts of\r\nParis.  They had come from Sedan mainly by two routes--the Crown\r\nPrince of Saxony marching by the northern line, through Laon and\r\nSoissons, and the Crown Prince of Prussia by the southern line,\r\nkeeping his right wing on the north bank of the Marne, while his left\r\nand centre approached the French capital by roads between that river\r\nand the Seine.\r\n\r\nThe march of these armies had been unobstructed by any resistance\r\nworth mentioning, and as the routes of both columns lay through a\r\nregion teeming with everything necessary for their support, and rich\r\neven in luxuries, it struck me that such campaigning was more a vast\r\npicnic than like actual war.  The country supplied at all points\r\nbread, meat, and wine in abundance, and the neat villages, never more\r\nthan a mile or two apart, always furnished shelter; hence the\r\nenormous trains required to feed and provide camp equipage for an\r\narmy operating in a sparsely settled country were dispensed with; in\r\ntruth, about the only impedimenta of the Germans was their wagons\r\ncarrying ammunition, pontoon-boats, and the field-telegraph.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 20th I started out accompanied by Forsyth and\r\nSir Henry Havelock, and took the road through Boissy St. George,\r\nBoissy St. Martins and Noisy Le Grand to Brie.  Almost every foot of\r\nthe way was strewn with fragments of glass from wine bottles, emptied\r\nand then broken by the troops.  There was, indeed, so much of this\r\nthat I refrain from making any estimate of the number of bottles,\r\nlest I be thought to exaggerate, but the road was literally paved\r\nwith glass, and the amount of wine consumed (none was wasted) must\r\nhave been enormous, far more, even, than I had seen evidence of at\r\nany time before.  There were two almost continuous lines of broken\r\nbottles along the roadsides all the way down from Sedan; but that\r\nexhibit was small compared with what we saw about Brie.\r\n\r\nAt Brie we were taken charge of by the German commandant of the\r\nplace.  He entertained us most hospitably for an hour or so, and\r\nthen, accompanied by a lieutenant, who was to be our guide, I set out\r\nahead of my companions to gain a point on the picket-line where I\r\nexpected to get a good look at the French, for their rifle-pits were\r\nbut a few hundred yards off across the Marne, their main line being\r\njust behind the rifle-pits.  As the lieutenant and I rode through the\r\nvillage, some soldiers warned us that the adventure would be\r\ndangerous, but that we could probably get to the desired place unhurt\r\nif we avoided the French fire by forcing our horses to a run in\r\ncrossing some open streets where we would be exposed.  On getting to\r\nthe first street my guide galloped ahead to show the way, and as the\r\nFrench were not on the lookout for anything of the kind at these\r\ndangerous points, only a few stray shots were drawn by the\r\nlieutenant, but when I followed, they were fully up to what was going\r\non, and let fly a volley every time they saw me in the open.\r\nFortunately, however, in their excitement they overshot, but when I\r\ndrew rein alongside of my guide under protection of the bluff where\r\nthe German picket was posted, my hair was all on end, and I was about\r\nas badly scared as ever I had been in my life.  As soon as I could\r\nrecover myself I thought of Havelock and Forsyth, with the hope that\r\nthey would not follow; nor did they, for having witnessed my\r\nexperience, they wisely concluded that, after all, they did not care\r\nso much to see the French rifle-pits.\r\n\r\nWhen I had climbed to the top of the bluff I was much disappointed,\r\nfor I could see but little--only the advanced rifle-pits across the\r\nriver, and Fort Nogent beyond them, not enough, certainly, to repay a\r\nnon-combatant for taking the risk of being killed.  The next question\r\nwas to return, and deciding to take no more such chances as those we\r\nhad run in coming out, I said we would wait till dark, but this\r\nproved unnecessary, for to my utter astonishment my guide informed me\r\nthat there was a perfectly safe route by which we might go back.  I\r\nasked why we had not taken it in coming, and he replied that he had\r\nthought it \"too long and circuitous.\"  To this I could say nothing,\r\nbut I concluded that that was not quite the correct reason; the truth\r\nis that early that morning the young fellow had been helping to empty\r\nsome of the many wine bottles I saw around Brie, and consequently had\r\na little more \"Dutch courage\"--was a little more rash--than would\r\nhave been the case under other conditions.\r\n\r\nI rode back to Brie by the \"long and circuitous\" route, and inquiring\r\nthere for my companions, found Havelock waiting to conduct me to the\r\nvillage of Villiers, whither, he said, Forsyth had been called to\r\nmake some explanation about his passport, which did not appear to be\r\nin satisfactory shape.  Accordingly we started for Villiers, and\r\nHavelock, being well mounted on an English \"hunter,\" and wishing to\r\ngive me an exhibition of the animal's training and power, led the way\r\nacross ditches and fences, but my horse, never having followed \"the\r\nhounds,\" was unsafe to experiment with, so, after trying a low fence\r\nor two, I decided to leave my friend alone in his diversion, and a\r\nfew moments later, seeing both horse and rider go down before a ditch\r\nand high stone wall, I was convinced that my resolution was a\r\ndiscreet one.  After this mishap, which luckily resulted in no harm,\r\nI hoped Sir Henry would give up the amusement, but by failure\r\nbecoming only the more determined, in a second effort he cleared the\r\nwall handsomely and rode across-country to the villages.  Following\r\nthe road till it passed under a railway bridge, I there thought I saw\r\na chance to gain Villiers by a short-cut, and changing my course\r\naccordingly, I struck into a large vineyard to the left, and\r\nproceeding a few hundred yards through the vines, came suddenly upon\r\na German picket-post.  The guard immediately leveled their rifles at\r\nme, when, remembering my Rezonville experience of being taken for a\r\nFrench officer because of my uniform, I hastily flung myself from the\r\nsaddle in token of surrender.  The action being rightly interpreted,\r\nthe men held their fire, and as my next thought was the King's pass I\r\nreached under my coat-skirt for the document, but this motion being\r\ntaken as a grab for my pistol, the whole lot of them--some ten in\r\nnumber--again aimed at me, and with such loud demands for surrender\r\nthat I threw up my hands and ran into their ranks.  The officer of\r\nthe guard then coming up, examined my credentials, and seeing that\r\nthey were signed by the King of Prussia, released me and directed the\r\nrecovery of my horse, which was soon caught, and I was then conducted\r\nto the quarters of the commandant, where I found Forsyth with his\r\npass properly vised, entirely ignorant of my troubles, and\r\ncontentedly regaling himself on cheese and beer.  Havelock having got\r\nto the village ahead of me, thanks to his cross-country ride, was\r\nthere too, sipping beer with Forsyth; nor was I slow to follow their\r\nexample, for the ride of the day, though rather barren in other\r\nresults, at any rate had given me a ravenous appetite.\r\n\r\nLate that evening, the 20th, we resumed our old quarters at Lagny,\r\nand early next day I made a visit to the royal headquarters at\r\nFerrires, where I observed great rejoicing going on, the occasion for\r\nit being an important victory gained near Mendon, a French corps of\r\nabout 30,000 men under General Ducrot having been beaten by the Fifth\r\nPrussian and Second Bavarian corps.  Ducrot had been stubbornly\r\nholding ground near Mendon for two or three days, much to the\r\nembarrassment of the Germans too, since he kept them from closing a\r\ngap in their line to the southwest of Paris; but in the recent fight\r\nhe had been driven from the field with such heavy loss as to render\r\nimpossible his maintaining the gap longer.  The Crown Prince of\r\nPrussia was thus enabled to extend his left, without danger, as far\r\nas Bougival, north of Versailles, and eventually met the right of the\r\nCrown Prince of Saxony, already at Denil, north of St. Denis.  The\r\nunbroken circle of investment around Paris being well-nigh assured,\r\nnews of its complete accomplishment was momentarily expected;\r\ntherefore everybody was jubilant on account of the breaking up of\r\nDucrot, but more particularly because word had been received the same\r\nmorning that a correspondence had begun between Bazaine and Prince\r\nFrederick Charles, looking to the capitulation of Metz, for the\r\nsurrender of that place would permit the Second Army to join in the\r\nsiege of Paris.\r\n\r\nLearning all this, and seeing that the investment was about\r\ncompleted, I decided to take up my quarters at Versailles, and\r\nstarted for that place on the 22d, halting at Noisy le Grand to take\r\nluncheon with some artillery officers, whose acquaintance we had made\r\nthe day of the surrender at Sedan.  During the meal I noticed two\r\nAmerican flags flying on a couple of houses near by.  Inquiring the\r\nsignificance of this, I was told that the flags had been put up to\r\nprotect the buildings--the owners, two American citizens, having in a\r\nbad fright abandoned their property, and, instead of remaining\r\noutside, gone into Paris,--\"very foolishly,\" said our hospitable\r\nfriends, \"for here they could have obtained food in plenty, and been\r\nperfectly secure from molestation.\"\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Versailles about 7 o'clock that evening and settled\r\nourselves in the Hotel Reservoir, happy to find there two or three\r\nAmerican families, with whom, of course, we quickly made\r\nacquaintance.  This American circle was enlarged a few days later by\r\nthe arrival of General Wm. B. Hazen, of our army, General Ambrose E.\r\nBurnside, and Mr. Paul Forbes.  Burnside and Forbes were hot to see,\r\nfrom the French side, something of the war, and being almost beside\r\nthemselves to get into Paris, a permit was granted them by Count\r\nBismarck, and they set out by way of Sevres, Forsyth and I\r\naccompanying them as far as the Palace of St. Cloud, which we,\r\nproposed to see, though there were strict orders against its being\r\nvisited generally.  After much trouble we managed, through the \"open\r\nsesame\" of the King's pass, to gain access to the palace; but to our\r\ngreat disappointment we found that all the pictures had been cut from\r\nthe frames and carried off to Paris, except one portrait, that of\r\nQueen Victoria, against whom the French were much incensed.  All\r\nother works of art had been removed, too--a most fortunate\r\ncircumstance, for the palace being directly on the German line, was\r\nraked by the guns from the fortress of Mont Valerien, and in a few\r\ndays burned to the ground.\r\n\r\nIn less than a week Burnside and Forbes returned from Paris.  They\r\ntold us their experience had been interesting, but were very reticent\r\nas to particulars, and though we tried hard to find out what they had\r\nseen or done, we could get nothing from them beyond the general\r\nstatement that they had had a good time, and that General Trochu had\r\nbeen considerate enough to postpone a sortie, in order to let them\r\nreturn; but this we did not quite swallow.  After a day or two they\r\nwent into Paris again, and I then began to suspect that they were\r\nessaying the role of mediators, and that Count Bismarck was feeding\r\ntheir vanity with permits, and receiving his equivalent by learning\r\nthe state of affairs within the beleaguered city.\r\n\r\nFrom about the 1st of October on, the Germans were engaged in making\r\ntheir enveloping lines impenetrable, bringing up their reserves,\r\nsiege guns, and the like, the French meanwhile continuing to drill\r\nand discipline the National Guard and relieving the monotony\r\noccasionally by a more or less spirited, but invariably abortive,\r\nsortie.  The most notable of these was that made by General Vinoy\r\nagainst the heights of Clamart, the result being a disastrous repulse\r\nby the besiegers.  After this, matters settled down to an almost\r\nuninterrupted quietude, only a skirmish here and there; and it being\r\nplain that the Germans did not intend to assault the capital, but\r\nwould accomplish its capture by starvation, I concluded to find out\r\nfrom Count Bismarck about when the end was expected, with the purpose\r\nof spending the interim in a little tour through some portions of\r\nEurope undisturbed by war, returning in season for the capitulation.\r\nCount Bismarck having kindly advised me as to the possible date.\r\n\r\nForsyth and I, on the 14th of October, left Versailles, going first\r\ndirect to the Chateau Ferrieres to pay our respects to the King,\r\nwhich we did, and again took luncheon with him.  From the chateau we\r\ndrove to Meaux, and there spent the night; resuming our journey next\r\nmorning, we passed through Epernay, Rheims, and Rethel to Sedan,\r\nwhere we tarried a day, and finally, on October 18, reached Brussels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nBRUSSELS--DECIDING TO VISIT EASTERN EUROPE--AUSTRIA--DOWN THE DANUBE\r\n--IN CONSTANTINOPLE--THE LADIES OF THE HAREM--THE SULTAN--TURKISH\r\nSOLDIERS--A BANQUET--A VISIT IN ATHENS--KING GEORGE OF GREECE--VICTOR\r\nEMMANUEL--\"BEDEVILED WITH CARES OF STATE\"--DEER SHOOTING--A MILITARY\r\nDINNER--RETURN TO VERSAILLES--GERMANS ENTERING PARIS--CRITICISM ON\r\nTHE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR--CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Brussels, one of the first things to do was to pay my\r\nrespects to the King of Belgium, which I did, accompanied by our\r\nMinister, Mr. Russell Jones.  Later I dined with the King and Queen,\r\nmeeting at the dinner many notable people, among them the Count and\r\nCountess of Flanders.  A day or two in Brussels sufficed to mature\r\nour plans for spending the time up to the approximate date of our\r\nreturn to Paris; and deciding to visit eastern Europe, we made Vienna\r\nour first objective, going there by way of Dresden.\r\n\r\nAt Vienna our Minister, Mr. John Jay, took charge of us--Forsyth was\r\nstill with me--and the few days' sojourn was full of interest.  The\r\nEmperor being absent from the capital, we missed seeing him; but the\r\nPrime Minister, Count von Beust, was very polite to us, and at his\r\nhouse we had the pleasure of meeting at dinner Count Andrassy, the\r\nPrime Minister of Hungary.\r\n\r\nFrom Vienna we went to Buda-Pesth, the Hungarian capital; and thence,\r\nin a I small, crowded, and uncomfortable steamboat, down the Danube\r\nto Rustchuck, whence we visited Bucharest--all who travel in eastern\r\nEurope do so--and then directing our course southward, we went first\r\nto Varna, and from that city by steamer through the Black Sea to\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\nWe reached the Turkish capital at the time of Ramadan, the period of\r\nthe year (about a month) during which the Mohammedans are commanded\r\nby the Koran to keep a rigorous fast every day from sunrise till\r\nsunset.  All the followers of the Prophet were therefore busy with\r\ntheir devotions--holding a revival, as it were; hence there was no\r\nchance whatever to be presented to the Sultan, Abdul Aziz, it being\r\nforbidden during the penitential season for him to receive\r\nunbelievers, or in fact any one except the officials of his\r\nhousehold.  However, the Grand Vizier brought me many messages of\r\nwelcome, and arranged that I should be permitted to see and salute\r\nhis Serene Highness on the Esplanade as he rode by on horseback to\r\nthe mosque.\r\n\r\nSo, the second day after arrival, the Grand Vizier drove me in a\r\nbarouche to the Esplanade, where we took station about midway of its\r\nlength an hour or so before the Sultan was to appear.  Shortly after\r\nwe reached the Esplanade, carriages occupied by the women of the\r\nSultan's harem began to appear, coming out from the palace grounds\r\nand driving up and down the roadway.  Only a few of the women were\r\nclosely veiled, a majority of them wearing an apology for veiling,\r\nmerely a strip of white lace covering the forehead down to the\r\neyebrows.  Some were yellow, and some white-types of the Mongolian\r\nand Caucasian races.  Now and then a pretty face was seen, rarely a\r\nbeautiful one.  Many were plump, even to corpulence, and these were\r\nthe closest veiled, being considered the greatest beauties I presume,\r\nsince with the Turk obesity is the chief element of comeliness.  As\r\nthe carriages passed along in review, every now and then an occupant,\r\nunable or unwilling to repress her natural promptings, would indulge\r\nin a mild flirtation, making overtures by casting demure\r\nside-glances, throwing us coquettish kisses, or waving strings of amber\r\nbeads with significant gestures, seeming to say: \"Why don't you\r\nfollow?\"  But this we could not do if we would, for the Esplanade\r\nthroughout its entire length was lined with soldiers, put there\r\nespecially to guard the harem first, and later, the Sultan on his\r\npilgrimage to the mosque.\r\n\r\nBut as it was now time for His Serene Highness to make his appearance\r\nthe carriages containing his wives drove off into the palace grounds,\r\nwhich were inclosed by a high wall, leaving the Esplanade wholly\r\nunencumbered except by the soldiers.  Down between the two ranks,\r\nwhich were formed facing each other, came the Sultan on a white\r\nsteed--a beautiful Arabian--and having at his side his son, a boy\r\nabout ten or twelve years old, who was riding a pony, a diminutive\r\ncopy of his father's mount, the two attended by a numerous\r\nbody-guard, dressed in gorgeous Oriental uniforms.  As the procession\r\npassed our carriage, I, as pre-arranged, stood up and took off my\r\nhat, His Serene Highness promptly acknowledging the salute by raising\r\nhis hand to the forehead.  This was all I saw of him, yet I received\r\nevery kindness at his hands, being permitted to see many of his\r\ntroops, to inspect all the ordnance, equipment, and other military\r\nestablishments about Constantinople, and to meet numbers of the high\r\nfunctionaries of the Empire.\r\n\r\nAmong other compliments tendered through his direction, and which I\r\ngladly accepted, was a review of all the troops then in Stamboul\r\n--about 6,000--comprising infantry, cavalry, and artillery.\r\n\r\nThey were as fine looking a body of soldiers as I ever saw--well\r\narmed and well clothed, the men all large and of sturdy appearance.\r\n\r\nAfter the review we attended a grand military dinner given by the\r\nGrand Vizier.  At the hour set for this banquet we presented\r\nourselves at the palace of the Grand Vizier, and being ushered into a\r\nlarge drawing-room, found already assembled there the guests invited\r\nto meet us.  Some few spoke French, and with these we managed to\r\nexchange an occasional remark; but as the greater number stood about\r\nin silence, the affair, thus far, was undeniably a little stiff.\r\nJust before the dinner was announced, all the Turkish officers went\r\ninto an adjoining room, and turning their faces to the east,\r\nprostrated themselves to the floor in prayer.  Then we were all\r\nconducted to a large salon, where each being provided with a silver\r\newer and basin, a little ball of highly perfumed soap and a napkin,\r\nset out on small tables, each guest washed his hands.  Adjacent to\r\nthis salon was the dining-room, or, rather, the banqueting room, a\r\nvery large and artistically frescoed hall, in the centre of which\r\nstood a crescent-shaped table, lighted with beautiful silver\r\ncandelabra, and tastefully decorated with flowers and fruits.  The\r\nviands were all excellent; cooked, evidently, by a French chef, and\r\nfull justice was done the dishes, especially by the Turks, who, of\r\ncourse, had been fasting all day.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the banquet, which consisted of not less than fifteen\r\ncourses, we withdrew to a smoking-room, where the coffee was served\r\nand cigarettes and chibouks offered us--the latter a pipe having a\r\nlong flexible stem with an amber mouthpiece.  I chose the chibouk,\r\nand as the stem of mine was studded with precious stones of enormous\r\nvalue, I thought I should enjoy it the more; but the tobacco being\r\nhighly flavored with some sort of herbs, my smoke fell far short of\r\nmy anticipations.  The coffee was delicious, however, and I found\r\nthis to be the case wherever I went in Constantinople, whether in\r\nmaking calls or at dinner, the custom of offering coffee and tobacco\r\non these occasions being universal.\r\n\r\nThe temptations to linger at Constantinople were many indeed, not the\r\nleast being the delightful climate; and as time pressed, we set out\r\nwith much regret on the return journey, stopping a few days at\r\nAthens, whence we made several short excursions into the interior.\r\nKing George and Queen Olga made our stay in Athens one of extreme\r\ninterest and exceeding pleasure.  Throwing aside all ceremony, they\r\nbreakfasted and dined us informally, gave us a fine ball, and in\r\naddition to these hospitalities showed us much personal attention,\r\nhis Majesty even calling upon me, and the Queen sending her children\r\nto see us at our hotel.\r\n\r\nOf course we visited all that remained of the city's ancient\r\ncivilization--the Acropolis, temples, baths, towers, and the like;\r\nnor did we omit to view the spot where St. Paul once instructed the\r\nAthenians in lessons of Christianity.  We traveled some little\r\nthrough the country districts outside of Athens, and I noticed that\r\nthe peasantry, in point of picturesqueness of dress and color of\r\ncomplexion, were not unlike the gypsies we see at times in America.\r\nThey had also much of the same shrewdness, and, as far as I could\r\nlearn, were generally wholly uneducated, ignorant, indeed, except as\r\nto one subject--politics--which I was told came to them intuitively,\r\nthey taking to it, and a scramble for office, as naturally as a duck\r\nto water.  In fact, this common faculty for politics seems a\r\nconnecting link between the ancient and modern Greek.\r\n\r\nLeaving Athens with the pleasantest recollections, we sailed for\r\nMessina, Sicily, and from there went to Naples, where we found many\r\nold friends; among them Mr. Buchanan Reed, the artist and poet, and\r\nMiss Brewster, as well as a score or more of others of our\r\ncountrymen, then or since distinguished, in art and letters at home\r\nand abroad.  We remained some days in Naples, and during the time\r\nwent to Pompeii to witness a special excavation among the ruins of\r\nthe buried city, which search was instituted on account of our visit.\r\nA number of ancient household articles were dug up, and one, a terra\r\ncotta lamp bearing upon its crown in bas-relief the legend of \"Leda\r\nand the Swan,\" was presented to me as a souvenir of the occasion,\r\nthough it is usual for the Government to place in its museums\r\neverything of such value that is unearthed.\r\n\r\nFrom Naples to Rome by rail was our next journey.  In the Eternal\r\nCity we saw picture-galleries, churches, and ruins in plenty, but all\r\nthese have been so well described by hundreds of other travelers that\r\nI shall not linger even to name them.  While at Rome we also\r\nwitnessed an overflow of the Tiber, that caused great suffering and\r\ndestroyed much property.  The next stage of our tour took us to\r\nVenice, then to Florence--the capital of Italy--for although the\r\ntroops of the King of Italy had taken possession of Rome the\r\npreceding September, the Government itself had not yet removed\r\nthither.\r\n\r\nAt Florence, our Minister, Mr. Marsh, though suffering with a lame\r\nfoot, took me in charge, and in due course of time I was presented to\r\nKing Victor-Emmanuel.  His Majesty received me informally at his\r\npalace in a small, stuffy room--his office, no doubt--and an untidy\r\none it was too.  He wore a loose blouse and very baggy trousers; a\r\ncomfortable suit, certainly, but not at all conducing to an ideal\r\nkingliness of appearance.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty's hobby was hunting, and no sooner had I made my bow than\r\nhe began a conversation on that subject, thrusting his hands nearly\r\nup to the elbows into the pockets of his trousers.  He desired to\r\nlearn about the large game of America, particularly the buffalo, and\r\nwhen I spoke of the herds of thousands and thousands I had seen on\r\nthe plains of western Kansas, he interrupted me to bemoan the fate\r\nwhich kept him from visiting America to hunt, even going so far as to\r\nsay that \"he didn't wish to be King of Italy, anyhow, but would much\r\nprefer to pass his days hunting than be bedeviled with the cares of\r\nstate.\" On one of his estates, near Pisa, he had several large herds\r\nof deer, many wild boars, and a great deal of other game. Of this\r\npreserve he was very proud, and before we separated invited me to go\r\ndown there to shoot deer, adding that he would be there himself if he\r\ncould, but feared that a trip which he had to take to Milan would\r\ninterfere, though he wished me to go in any event.\r\n\r\nI gladly accepted the invitation, and in two or three days was\r\nnotified when I would be expected at the estate.  At the designated\r\ntime I was escorted to Pisa by an aide-de-camp, and from there we\r\ndrove the few miles to the King's chateau, where we fortified\r\nourselves for the work in hand by an elaborate and toothsome\r\nbreakfast of about ten courses.  Then in a carriage we set out for\r\nthe King's stand in the hunting-grounds, accompanied by a crowd of\r\nmounted game-keepers, who with great difficulty controlled the pack\r\nof sixty or seventy hounds, the dogs and keepers together almost\r\ndriving me to distraction with their yelping and yelling.  On\r\nreaching the stand, I was posted within about twenty' yards of a\r\nlong, high picket-fence, facing the fence and covered by two trees\r\nvery close together.  It was from behind these that the King usually\r\nshot, and as I was provided with a double-barreled shot-gun, I\r\nthought I could do well, especially since close in rear of me stood\r\ntwo game-keepers to load and hand me a second gun when the first was\r\nemptied.\r\n\r\nMeantime the huntsmen and the hounds had made a circuit of the park\r\nto drive up the game.  The yelps of the hounds drawing near, I\r\ncautiously looked in the direction of the sound, and the next moment\r\nsaw a herd of deer close in to the fence, and coming down at full\r\nspeed.  Without a miss, I shot the four leading ones as they tried\r\nto run the gauntlet, for in passing between the stand and the fence,\r\nthe innocent creatures were not more than ten to fifteen paces from\r\nme.  At the fourth I stopped, but the gamekeepers insisted on more\r\nbutchery, saying, \"No one but the King ever did the like\" (I guess no\r\none else had ever had the chance), so, thus urged, I continued firing\r\ntill I had slaughtered eleven with eleven shots--an easy task with a\r\nshot-gun and buckshot cartridges.\r\n\r\nThe \"hunt\" being ended--for with this I had had enough, and no one\r\nelse was permitted to do any shooting--the aide-decamp directed the\r\ngame to be sent to me in Florence, and we started for the chateau.\r\nOn the way back I saw a wild boar the first and only one I ever saw\r\n--my attention being drawn to him by cries from some of the\r\ngame-keepers.  There was much commotion, the men pointing out the game\r\nand shouting excitedly, \"See the wild boar!\" otherwise I should not\r\nhave known what was up, but now, looking in the indicated direction, I\r\nsaw scudding over the plain what appeared to me to be nothing but a\r\nhalfgrown black pig, or shoat.  He was not in much of a hurry either,\r\nand gave no evidence of ferocity, yet it is said that this\r\ninsignificant looking animal is dangerous when hunted with the spear\r\n--the customary way.  After an early dinner at the chateau we returned\r\nto Florence, and my venison next day arriving, it was distributed among\r\nmy American friends in the city.\r\n\r\nShortly after the hunt the King returned from Milan, and then honored\r\nme with a military dinner, his Majesty and all the guests, numbering\r\neighty, appearing in full uniform.  The banqueting hall was lighted\r\nwith hundreds of wax candles, there was a profusion of beautiful\r\nflowers, and to me the scene altogether was one of unusual\r\nmagnificence.  The table service was entirely of gold--the celebrated\r\nset of the house of Savoy--and behind the chair of each guest stood a\r\nservant in powdered wig and gorgeous livery of red plush.  I sat at\r\nthe right of the King, who--his hands resting on his sword, the hilt\r\nof which glittered with jewels--sat through the hour and a half at\r\ntable without once tasting food or drink, for it was his rule to eat\r\nbut two meals in twenty-four hours--breakfast at noon, and dinner at\r\nmidnight.  The King remained silent most of the time, but when he did\r\nspeak, no matter on what subject, he inevitably drifted back to\r\nhunting.  He never once referred to the Franco-Prussian war, nor to\r\nthe political situation in his own country, then passing through a\r\ncrisis.  In taking leave of his Majesty I thanked him with deep\r\ngratitude for honoring me so highly, and his response was that if\r\never he came to America to hunt buffalo, he should demand my\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nFrom Florence I went to Milan and Geneva, then to Nice, Marseilles,\r\nand Bordeaux.  Assembled at Bordeaux was a convention which had been\r\ncalled together by the government of the National Defense for the\r\npurpose of confirming or rejecting the terms of an armistice of\r\ntwenty-one days, arranged between Jules Favre and Count Bismarck in\r\nnegotiations begun at Versailles the latter part of January.  The\r\nconvention was a large body, chosen from all parts of France, and was\r\nunquestionably the most noisy, unruly and unreasonable set of beings\r\nthat I ever saw in a legislative assembly.  The frequent efforts of\r\nThiers, Jules Favre, and other leading men to restrain the more\r\nimpetuous were of little avail.  When at the sittings a delegate\r\narose to speak on some question, he was often violently pulled to his\r\nseat and then surrounded by a mob of his colleagues, who would throw\r\noff their coats and gesticulate wildly, as though about to fight.\r\n\r\nBut the bitter pill of defeat had to be swallowed in some way, so the\r\nconvention delegated M. Thiers to represent the executive power of\r\nthe country, with authority to construct a ministry three\r\ncommissioners were appointed by the Executive, to enter into further\r\nnegotiations with Count Bismarck at Versailles and arrange a peace,\r\nthe terms of which, however, were to be submitted to the convention\r\nfor final action.  Though there had been so much discussion, it took\r\nbut a few days to draw up and sign a treaty at Versailles, the\r\nprincipal negotiators being Thiers and Jules Favre for France, and\r\nBismarck on the part of the Germans.  The terms agreed upon provided\r\nfor the occupation of Paris till ratification should be had by the\r\nconvention at Bordeaux; learning of which stipulation from our\r\nMinister, Mr. Washburn, I hurried off to Paris to see the conquerors\r\nmake their triumphal entry.\r\n\r\nIn the city the excitement was at fever heat, of course; the entire\r\npopulation protesting with one voice that they would never, never\r\nlook upon the hated Germans marching through their beloved city.  No!\r\nwhen the day arrived they would hide themselves in their houses, or\r\nshut their eyes to such a hateful sight.  But by the 1st of March a\r\nchange had come over the fickle Parisians, for at an early hour the\r\nsidewalks were jammed with people, and the windows and doors of the\r\nhouses filled with men, women, and children eager to get a look at\r\nthe conquerors.  Only a few came in the morning, however--an\r\nadvance-guard of perhaps a thousand cavalry and infantry.  The main\r\ncolumn marched from the Arc-de-Triomphe toward the middle of the\r\nafternoon. In its composition it represented United Germany--Saxons,\r\nBavarians, and the Royal Guard of Prussia--and, to the strains of\r\nmartial music, moving down the Champ Elysees to the Place de la\r\nConcorde, was distributed thence over certain sections of the city\r\nagreed upon beforehand.  Nothing that could be called a disturbance\r\ntook place during the march; and though there was a hiss now and then\r\nand murmurings of discontent, yet the most noteworthy mutterings were\r\ndirected against the defunct Empire.  Indeed, I found everywhere that\r\nthe national misfortunes were laid at Napoleon's door--he, by this\r\ntime, having become a scapegoat for every blunder of the war.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor William (he had been proclaimed German Emperor at\r\nVersailles the 18th of January) did not accompany his troops into\r\nParis, though he reviewed them at Long Champs before they started.\r\nAfter the occupation of the city he still remained at Versailles, and\r\nas soon as circumstances would permit, I repaired to the Imperial\r\nheadquarters to pay my respects to his Majesty under his new title\r\nand dignities, and to say good-bye.\r\n\r\nBesides the Emperor, the only persons I me at Versailles were General\r\nvon Moltke and Bismarck.  His Majesty was in a very agreeable frame\r\nof mind, and as bluff and hearty as usual.  His increased rank and\r\npower had effected no noticeable change of any kind in him, and by\r\nhis genial and cordial ways he made me think that my presence with\r\nthe German army had contributed to his pleasure.  Whether this was\r\nreally so or not, I shall always believe it true, for his kind words\r\nand sincere manner could leave no other conclusion.\r\n\r\nGeneral von Moltke was, as usual, quiet and reserved, betraying not\r\nthe slightest consciousness of his great ability, nor the least\r\nindication of pride on account of his mighty work.  I say this\r\nadvisedly, for it is an undoubted fact that it was his marvelous\r\nmind that perfected the military system by which 800,000 men were\r\nmobilized with unparalleled celerity and moved with such certainty of\r\ncombination that, in a campaign of seven months, the military power\r\nof France was destroyed and her vast resources sorely crippled.\r\n\r\nI said good-bye to Count Bismarck, also, for at that busy time the\r\nchances of seeing him again were very remote.  The great Chancellor\r\nmanifested more joy over the success of the Germans than did anyone\r\nelse at the Imperial headquarters.  Along with his towering strength\r\nof mind and body, his character partook of much of the enthusiasm and\r\nimpulsiveness commonly restricted to younger men, and now in his\r\nfrank, free way be plainly showed his light-heartedness and\r\ngratification at success.  That which for years his genius had been\r\nplanning and striving for--permanent unification of the German\r\nStates, had been accomplished by the war.  It had welded them\r\ntogether in a compact Empire which no power in Europe could disrupt,\r\nand as such a union was the aim of Bismarck's life, he surely had a\r\nright to feel jubilant.\r\n\r\nThanks to the courtesies extended me, I had been able to observe the\r\nprincipal battles, and study many of the minor details of a war\r\nbetween two of the greatest military nations of the world, and to\r\nexamine critically the methods followed abroad for subsisting,\r\nequipping, and manoeuvring vast bodies of men during a stupendous,\r\ncampaign.  Of course I found a great deal to interest and instruct\r\nme, yet nowadays war is pretty much the same everywhere, and this one\r\noffered no marked exception to my previous experiences.  The methods\r\npursued on the march were the same as we would employ, with one most\r\nimportant exception.  Owing to the density of population throughout\r\nFrance it was always practicable for the Germans to quarter their\r\ntroops in villages, requiring the inhabitants to subsist both\r\nofficers and men.  Hence there was no necessity for camp and garrison\r\nequipage, nor enormous provision trains, and the armies were\r\nunencumbered by these impedimenta, indispensable when operating in a\r\npoor and sparsely settled country.  As I have said before, the only\r\ntrains were those for ammunition, pontoon-boats, and the field\r\ntelegraph, and all these were managed by special corps.  If\r\ntransportation was needed for other purposes, it was obtained by\r\nrequisition from the invaded country, just as food and forage were\r\nsecured.  Great celerity of combination was therefore possible, the\r\ncolumns moving in compact order, and as all the roads were broad and\r\nmacadamized, there was little or nothing to delay or obstruct the\r\nmarch of the Germans, except when their enemy offered resistance, but\r\neven this was generally slight and not very frequent, for the French\r\nwere discouraged by disaster from the very outset of the campaign.\r\n\r\nThe earlier advantages gained by the Germans may be ascribed to the\r\nstrikingly prompt mobilization of their armies, one of the most\r\nnoticeable features of their perfect military system, devised by\r\nalmost autocratic power; their later successes were greatly aided by\r\nthe blunders of the French, whose stupendous errors materially\r\nshortened the war, though even if prolonged it could, in my opinion,\r\nhave had ultimately no other termination.\r\n\r\nAs I have previously stated, the first of these blunders was the\r\nacceptance of battle by MacMahon at Worth; the second in attaching\r\ntoo much importance to the fortified position of Metz, resulting in\r\nthree battles Colombey, Mars-la-Tour, and Gravelotte--all of which\r\nwere lost; and the third, the absurd movement of MacMahon along the\r\nBelgian frontier to relieve Metz, the responsibility for which, I am\r\nglad to say, does not belong to him.\r\n\r\nWith the hemming in of Bazaine at Metz and the capture of MacMahon's\r\narmy at Sedan the crisis of the war was passed, and the Germans\r\npractically the victors.  The taking of Paris was but a sentiment\r\n--the money levy could have been made and the Rhine provinces held\r\nwithout molesting that city, and only the political influences\r\nconsequent upon the changes in the French Government caused peace to\r\nbe deferred.\r\n\r\nI did not have much opportunity to observe the German cavalry, either\r\non the march or in battle.  The only time I saw any of it engaged was\r\nin the unfortunate charge at Gravelotte.  That proved its mettle good\r\nand discipline fair, but answered no other purpose.  Such of it as\r\nwas not attached to the infantry was organized in divisions, and\r\noperated in accordance with the old idea of covering the front and\r\nflanks of the army, a duty which it thoroughly performed.  But thus\r\ndirected it was in no sense an independent corps, and hence cannot\r\nbe, said to have accomplished anything in the campaign, or have had a\r\nweight or influence at all proportionate to its strength.  The method\r\nof its employment seemed to me a mistake, for, being numerically\r\nsuperior to the French cavalry, had it been massed and manoeuvred\r\nindependently of the infantry, it could easily have broken up the\r\nFrench communications, and done much other work of weighty influence\r\nin the prosecution of the war.\r\n\r\nThe infantry was as fine as I ever saw, the men young and hardy in\r\nappearance, and marching always with an elastic stride.  The infantry\r\nregiment, however, I thought too large--too many men for a colonel to\r\ncommand unless he has the staff of a general--but this objection may\r\nbe counterbalanced by the advantages resulting from associating\r\ntogether thus intimately the men from the same district, or county as\r\nwe would call it; the celerity of mobilization, and, in truth, the\r\nvery foundation of the German system, being based on this local or\r\nterritorial scheme of recruiting.\r\n\r\nThere was no delay when the call sounded for the march; all turned\r\nout promptly, and while on the road there was very little straggling,\r\nonly the sick falling out.  But on such fine, smooth roads, and with\r\nsuccess animating the men from the day they struck the first blow, it\r\ncould hardly be expected that the columns would not keep well closed\r\nup.  Then, too, it must be borne in mind that, as already stated,\r\n'campaigning' in France--that is, the marching, camping, and\r\nsubsisting of an army--is an easy matter, very unlike anything we,\r\nhad during the war of the rebellion.  To repeat: the country is rich,\r\nbeautiful, and densely populated, subsistence abundant, and the\r\nroads--all macadamized highways; thus the conditions; are altogether\r\ndifferent from those existing with us.  I think that under the same\r\ncircumstances our troops would have done as well as the Germans,\r\nmarched as admirably, made combinations as quickly and accurately,\r\nand fought with as much success.  I can but leave to conjecture how.\r\nthe Germans would have got along on bottomless roads--often none at\r\nall--through the swamps and quicksands of northern Virginia, from,\r\nthe Wilderness to Petersburg, and from Chattanooga to Atlanta and the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nFollowing the operations of the German armies from the battle of\r\nGravelotte to the siege of Paris, I may, in conclusion, say that I\r\nsaw no new military principles developed, whether of strategy or\r\ngrand tactics, the movements of the different armies and corps being\r\ndictated and governed by the same general laws that have so long\r\nobtained, simplicity of combination and manoeuvre, and the\r\nconcentration of a numerically superior force at the vital point.\r\n\r\nAfter my brief trip to Versailles, I remained in Paris till the\r\nlatter part of March.  In company with Mr. Washburn, I visited the\r\nfortifications for the defense of the city, and found them to be\r\nexceptionally heavy; so strong, indeed, that it would have been very\r\nhard to carry the place by a general assault.  The Germans, knowing\r\nthe character of the works, had refrained from the sacrifice of life\r\nthat such an attempt must entail, though they well knew that many of\r\nthe forts were manned by unseasoned soldiers.  With only a combat\r\nhere and there, to tighten their lines or repulse a sortie, they\r\nwisely preferred to wait till starvation should do the work with\r\nlittle loss and absolute certainty.\r\n\r\nThe Germans were withdrawn from Paris on the 3d of March, and no\r\nsooner were they gone than factional quarrels, which had been going\r\non at intervals ever since the flight of the Empress and the fall of\r\nher regency on the 4th of September, were renewed with revolutionary\r\nmethods that eventually brought about the Commune.  Having witnessed\r\none or two of these outbreaks, and concluding that while such\r\nturbulence reigned in the city it would be of little profit for me to\r\ntarry there, I decided to devote the rest of the time I could be away\r\nfrom home to travel in England, Ireland, and Scotland.  My journeys\r\nthrough those countries were full of pleasure and instruction, but as\r\nnothing I saw or did was markedly different from what has been so\r\noften described by others, I will save the reader this part of my\r\nexperience.  I returned to America in the fall, having been absent a\r\nlittle more than a year, and although I saw much abroad of absorbing\r\ninterest, both professional and general, yet I came back to my native\r\nland with even a greater love for her, and with increased admiration\r\nfor her institutions.",
