Antedating the\r\nbeginning of this effort by thirty years was the attempt to\r\nenfranchise women through the amendment of State constitutions. After\r\n1869 the two movements were contemporaneous, each dependent on the\r\nother, the latter a long process but essential in some measure to the\r\nsuccess of the former. There is no way by which the progress of the\r\nmovement for woman suffrage can be so clearly seen as by a comparison\r\nof the State chapters in this volume with the State chapters in Volume\r\nIV, which closed with 1900. The former show the remarkable development\r\nof the organized work for woman suffrage, especially in the last\r\ndecade, which brought the complete victory.\r\n\r\nIn Volume IV it was possible to give a résumé of the Laws specifically\r\nrelating to women and one was sent with each chapter for this volume.\r\nThe space occupied by the account of the work for the suffrage,\r\nhowever, made it necessary to omit them. It required thousands of\r\nwords to record the legislation of the last twenty years relating\r\nespecially to women in some of the States and the large part of it to\r\nwomen in the industries, which they had scarcely entered in 1900. The\r\nsame is true of child labor. Every State shows a desire for protective\r\nlegislation. Many States provide for mothers' pensions, a modern\r\ntendency. About half of the States now have equal guardianship laws.\r\nThere is a gradual increase in those enlarging the property and\r\nbusiness rights of married women. The \"age of consent\" and the age for\r\nmarriage have been raised in most States where they were too low. In\r\nevery State for a number of years the large organizations of women\r\nhave made a determined effort to obtain better laws for women and\r\nchildren and Legislatures have yielded to pressure. In every State as\r\nsoon as women were enfranchised there was improvement in laws relating\r\nto their welfare and that of children.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Woman Suffrage Amendment went into effect in August, 1920,\r\nand the following winter there was a greater amount of advanced\r\nlegislation in the various States than had taken place in the\r\npreceding ten years collectively, and the résumé of existing laws that\r\nhad been prepared for this volume was soon at least partially obsolete\r\nin many of them. A brief statement of Office Holding was incorporated\r\nbut its only value was in showing that in all States this was almost\r\nexclusively limited to \"electors.\" When the Federal Amendment was\r\nproclaimed it carried with it eligibility to the offices. In some\r\nStates it included Jury service but in others it was held that for\r\nthis special legislation was necessary. In all States the professions\r\nand other occupations are open to women the same as to men. In the way\r\nof Education every State University admits women, and the vast\r\nmajority of institutions of learning, except some of a religious\r\ncharacter, are co-educational. A few of the large eastern universities\r\nstill bar their doors but women have all needful opportunities for the\r\nhigher education. Some professional schools--law, medicine and\r\nespecially theology--are still closed to women but enough are open to\r\nthem to satisfy the demand, and the same is true of the technical\r\nschools. To meet the lack of space every chapter had to be drastically\r\ncut after it was in type.\r\n\r\nWomen now have in a general sense equality of rights, although in\r\nevery State they have learned or will learn that this is not literally\r\ntrue and that further effort will be required, but now, as never\r\nbefore, they are equipped for accomplishing it. It will be a long time\r\nbefore they have equality of opportunity in the business and political\r\nworld but for the majority this will not be needed. Women will find,\r\nhowever, that in the home, in club life and in all lines of religious,\r\nphilanthropic, educational and civic work the possession of a vote has\r\nincreased their influence and power beyond measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n\r\n INTRODUCTION                                                          i\r\n\r\n   Position of women in regard to laws, office holding, education,\r\n   etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n ALABAMA                                                               1\r\n\r\n   Early work -- Progress of organization -- Conventions held,\r\n   reports and speeches made, activities of the association --\r\n   Officers and workers -- Legislative action -- Campaigns -- Help\r\n   of the National Association -- Action on ratification of the\r\n   Federal Suffrage Amendment -- Interest taken by President\r\n   Wilson, National Committees and party leaders -- Celebrations.\r\n\r\n   [This form is followed in all the State chapters, with names of\r\n   officers, workers, friends and enemies and many incidents; also\r\n   results where woman suffrage exists.

I.\r\n\r\nALABAMA[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1902 Miss Frances Griffin of Verbena sent to the national suffrage\r\nconvention the following report as president of the State suffrage\r\nassociation: \"Two clubs in Alabama, in Huntsville and Decatur, are\r\nauxiliary to the National American Woman Suffrage Association. The\r\nState president did some aggressive work within the year, speaking in\r\nmany different towns before women's clubs and at parlor meetings. She\r\ndevoted much time to work of this character in Montgomery, hoping to\r\nbring to bear sufficient influence upon members of the Constitutional\r\nConvention to secure some concessions for women citizens. The results\r\nwere bitterly disappointing, for it not only refused to grant suffrage\r\nto tax-paying women but it gave to the husbands of tax-payers the\r\nright to vote upon their wives' property! Women in the larger towns\r\nare taking an interest in municipal and educational affairs. Some have\r\nbeen placed on advisory boards in State institutions, such as the\r\nGirls' Industrial School, the Boys' Reform School and others. All this\r\nmeans a gradual advance for the suffrage sentiment, a general\r\nmodifying of the anti-sentiment.\"\r\n\r\nThere were also short reports for 1903 and 1904, which, while showing\r\nno practical, tangible results of the efforts of that earnest pioneer\r\nworker, are interesting as evidences of the backward, unprogressive\r\nspirit against which the women of Alabama have had to contend. These\r\nreports mark the end of the first period of suffrage activity in the\r\nState, which had been maintained by a few devoted women. The new era\r\nwas ushered in by the organization in Selma in 1910 of an Equal\r\nSuffrage Association which was the beginning of an aggressive,\r\ntireless fight. Miss Mary Partridge, after seeing the defeat of a\r\nconstitutional amendment for prohibition in Alabama despite the\r\nearnest but ineffectual efforts of the women who besieged the polls\r\nbegging the men to vote for it, decided that the time was ripe for a\r\nwoman suffrage organization and wrote for advice to Dr. Anna Howard\r\nShaw, president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association,\r\nwho answered in part: \"I cannot express to you how happy I am that you\r\nare willing to begin the work in your State where very little has been\r\ndone for suffrage because of the great conservatism among the women of\r\nthe South. I am very glad if they are now beginning to realize their\r\nabsolutely helpless and unprotected position. We have the temperance\r\nagitation to thank for arousing a great many women over all the\r\ncountry....\"\r\n\r\nShortly after the receipt of this letter Miss Partridge sent out a\r\n\"call\" in the Selma papers and on March 29, 1910, Mrs. Frederick\r\nWatson, Mrs. F. T. Raiford, Mrs. F. G. DuBose, Mrs. F. M. Hatch and\r\nMiss Partridge met at the Carnegie Library and organized the\r\nassociation. This action was reported to Dr. Shaw and she extended the\r\ngreetings of the National Association with \"thanks and appreciation.\"\r\n\r\nThe Birmingham Equal Suffrage Association was the outgrowth of a small\r\ngroup of women who had been holding study meetings in the home of Mrs.\r\nW. L. Murdoch. The enthusiasm and earnest conviction resulting from\r\nthem found expression in a \"call\" for a woman suffrage organization\r\nand on Oct. 22, 1911, the association was formed at a meeting held in\r\nthe Chamber of Commerce, where the following officers were elected:\r\nPresident, Mrs. Pattie Ruffner Jacobs; first vice-president, Miss\r\nEthel Armes; second, Mrs. W. L. Murdoch; third, Mrs. W. N. Wood;\r\ncorresponding secretary, Miss Helen J. Benners; recording secretary,\r\nMrs. J. E. Frazier; treasurer, Mrs. A. J. Bowron.\r\n\r\nSpecial mention is made of these two societies because they\r\nconstituted the nucleus on which the State organization was formed. An\r\nurgent \"call\" was sent out by the officers of the Birmingham society\r\nto \"all men and women who wish to further the cause of woman suffrage\r\nto unite in a State organization at a meeting in Birmingham Oct. 9,\r\n1912.\" Selma sent six delegates who met with the Birmingham\r\nsuffragists at the Parish House of the Church of the Advent, where the\r\nAlabama Equal Suffrage Association was organized and a constitution\r\nand by-laws adopted. Mrs. Jacobs was elected president; Miss\r\nPartridge, first vice-president; Mrs. Raiford, second; Mrs. Murdoch,\r\ncorresponding secretary; Mrs. Julian Parke, recording secretary; Mrs.\r\nC. M. Spencer, treasurer; Miss Partridge, State organizer.[2]\r\n\r\nThe following delegates were appointed to attend the national\r\nconvention in Philadelphia in November; Mrs. Jacobs, Miss Amelia\r\nWorthington, Mrs. O. R. Hundley, Mrs. DuBose, Miss Partridge, Mrs.\r\nChappel Cory. The new State organization affiliated at once with the\r\nNational Association.\r\n\r\nThe first annual convention was held in Selma Jan. 29, 1913, with\r\ntwenty-five representatives from Selma, Birmingham, Huntsville and\r\nMontgomery. Mrs. Jacobs was re-elected president and a splendid\r\nprogram of constructive work was outlined for the ensuing year. The\r\nassociation was represented at the meeting of the International\r\nSuffrage Alliance held in Budapest in June of this year by Mrs. T. G.\r\nBush of Birmingham.\r\n\r\nThe second State convention, held in Huntsville Feb. 5, 1914, was made\r\nnotable by the inspiring presence of three of Alabama's pioneer\r\nsuffragists--Mrs. Annie Buel Drake Robertson, Mrs. Humes, and Mrs.\r\nVirginia Clay Clopton. The following local societies were represented\r\nby their presidents, named in the order in which they were organized:\r\nSelma, Mrs. Parke; Birmingham, Mrs. Hundley; Montgomery, Mrs. Sallie\r\nB. Powell; Huntsville, Mrs. Clopton; Cullman, Mrs. Ignatius Pollak;\r\nGreensboro, Miss S. Anne Hobson; Tuscaloosa, Mrs. Losey; Vinemont,\r\nMiss Mary Munson; Pell City, Miss Pearl Still; Coal City, Mrs. J. W.\r\nMoore; Mobile, Miss Eugenie Marks. Mrs. Jacobs was re-elected despite\r\nher wish to retire from office and her report of the past year told of\r\na great amount of work done by all the members of the board.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1915, a resolution to submit a woman suffrage amendment\r\nto the State constitution to the voters was for the first time\r\nintroduced in the Legislature. It was referred to the Committee on\r\nPrivileges and Elections in the House and the Legislature afterwards\r\nadjourned until July. In the meantime the women worked to secure\r\npledges from the members of the committee to report the bill favorably\r\nand 14 of the 16 gave their promise to do so. Instead of this it was\r\n\"postponed indefinitely.\" The women did not rest until they persuaded\r\nthe House to compel a report and then a hearing was granted to them.\r\nAmong those who worked in the Legislature were the legislative\r\nchairman, Mrs. O. R. Hundley; Mrs. Jacobs, the State president; Mrs.\r\nChappel Cory, president United Daughters of the Confederacy; Miss\r\nMollie Dowd, representing the wage earners, and Miss Lavinia Engle of\r\nMaryland, field organizer for the National Association. The bill came\r\nto a vote late in the session, when Representative Joe Green, who had\r\nasked for the privilege of introducing it, spoke and voted against it.\r\nThe vote stood 52 ayes, 43 noes, a three-fifths majority being\r\nnecessary to submit an amendment. As the Legislature meets only once\r\nin four years this was the only action ever taken on a State\r\namendment.\r\n\r\nAt the State convention, held in Tuscaloosa in February of this year,\r\nreports were made from 19 auxiliary branches and the organization of\r\n23 non-auxiliary branches was reported. The address of Dr. Shaw, the\r\nnational president, gave a great impetus to suffrage work in the\r\nState. Mrs. Jacobs and the other officers were re-elected, except that\r\nMrs. Frederick Koenig was made auditor.\r\n\r\nOn Feb. 9, 1916, the State convention was held in Gadsden and the\r\nevidences of the growth of the suffrage movement were most heartening,\r\n26 local associations sending reports. Mrs. Parke was chosen for\r\npresident, Mrs. Jacobs having been elected auditor of the National\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nThe State convention was held in Birmingham Feb. 12-13, 1917, and the\r\nofficers re-elected except that Miss Worthington was made recording\r\nsecretary. It was followed by a \"suffrage\" school conducted by\r\nrepresentatives of the National Association, who generously gave the\r\nvaluable help that a course of study under such able instructors\r\nafforded. Over 200 pupils attended. It was reported that there were\r\nnow 81 suffrage clubs in the State, which were being merged into\r\npolitical organizations with the county as a unit, and there were\r\nchairmen in 55 of the 67 counties. There were also chairmen in nine of\r\nthe ten congressional districts. A paid organizer had been at work.\r\nState headquarters were maintained on the principal street in Selma\r\nand a bi-weekly press bulletin issued which was used by thirty-four\r\nnewspapers, while eight published weekly suffrage columns. The\r\nBirmingham _News_ got out a suffrage edition. Four travelling suffrage\r\nlibraries were kept in circulation. Automobile parades had been given,\r\na mass meeting held in Birmingham and street meetings in every part of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nThe State convention was held in Selma May 7-8, 1918. The reports made\r\nby local and State officers showed that the suffragists had lent\r\nthemselves and all their machinery of organization to every form of\r\nwar work. Mrs. Jacobs had been appointed by Mr. McAdoo, Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, State chairman of the Woman's Liberty Loan Committee.\r\nSuffrage work was in no wise suspended but the more active forms of\r\npropaganda were held in abeyance. The Federal Amendment was endorsed\r\nin no uncertain terms and the following resolution was adopted:\r\n\"Whereas, the Senate will soon vote on the Federal Suffrage Amendment,\r\ntherefore, be it resolved, by the suffragists of Alabama assembled in\r\ntheir sixth annual convention, that the U. S. Senators, John H.\r\nBankhead and Oscar W. Underwood, be, and they hereby are, earnestly\r\npetitioned to forward the march of democracy, to carry out the policy\r\nof the Democratic administration and to represent truly the wishes of\r\nthe women of their own State by supporting this amendment and voting\r\nfor it when it comes up in the Senate.\"\r\n\r\nIt was reported that the State association had energetically\r\ncooperated with the National in all its suggestions and plans and\r\nnotwithstanding the efforts made to raise money for the purposes of\r\nthe war it had collected over $10,000 for State suffrage work and more\r\nthan paid its pledge of $1,000 to the national treasury. Thousands of\r\ncopies of U. S. Senator Shafroth's speech, the gift of the Leslie\r\nSuffrage Commission, had been mailed to the rural voters. The clergy\r\nhad been requested to speak on woman suffrage in their sermons on\r\n\"mothers' day\" and many responded. Miss Lola Trax, the State\r\norganizer, reported a chairman in all but two counties. Each of the\r\nState's representatives in Congress had been interviewed. Dr. Anna\r\nHoward Shaw, the national president, had lectured in seven places and\r\nMrs. Walter McNab Miller, national vice-president, in five. The\r\npetitions for the Federal Amendment were being circulated.\r\n\r\nThe Alabama delegates to the national convention in March, 1919,\r\nlearned while there that the Federal Amendment was likely to be passed\r\nby Congress in time for action to be taken on its ratification by the\r\nLegislature of the State, which had been called to meet July 8. They\r\nwent before the National Board and secured the promise of definite\r\nhelp, which was to consist of literature, press work and organizers,\r\nand certain obligations were undertaken on the part of the State. The\r\nNational Association did more even than it promised and the State\r\nsuffragists made heroic efforts to live up to their part of the\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\nOn May 1 the campaign was under way although the amendment had not yet\r\nbeen submitted. A Ratification Committee was appointed by the\r\npresident consisting of Mrs. John D. McNeel of Birmingham, chairman;\r\nMrs. W. D. Nesbit of Birmingham, vice-chairman; Mrs. Bibb Graves of\r\nMontgomery, resident member, and Mrs. Jacobs, ex-officio member.\r\nCounty chairmen were appointed in 53 counties and a Men's Committee of\r\nOne Hundred was organized. Headquarters were equipped with some paid\r\nand much faithful volunteer help and the distribution of literature\r\nand press work was started. Early in the month Mrs. Albert McMahon,\r\nMiss Edna Beveridge and Miss Josephine Miller, organizers, were sent\r\nby the National Association, to which group Miss Mary Parke London of\r\nBirmingham was added and contributed her services throughout the\r\nentire campaign as an organizer and lobbyist. Press work was\r\nsystematically carried on, some of the material sent from national\r\nheadquarters but most of it originating in Birmingham. Speakers\r\ncovered all important public meetings to which access could be had;\r\nGovernor Thomas E. Kilby and other prominent men were interviewed and\r\na poll was taken of the legislators before they convened.[3] At the\r\njoint hearing, which was arranged almost immediately after the\r\nLegislature met, John C. Anderson, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court;\r\nW. D. Nesbitt, State chairman of the Democratic Executive Committee;\r\nex-Senator Frank S. White; Judge S. D. Weakley, legal adviser of the\r\nGovernor, and others spoke for ratification.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. The Federal Amendment was submitted by Congress June 4\r\nand the Legislature met July 8. For days before the vote was taken it\r\noccupied almost exclusive attention at the capital, many of the\r\nnewspapers saying that the opposition were placing the State and the\r\nDemocratic party in a grave position. The Republican party was\r\nclaiming credit for the submission and Democratic leaders felt it to\r\nbe very necessary that the Alabama Legislature should ratify. On July\r\n12 President Wilson telegraphed to Governor Kilby as follows: \"I hope\r\nyou will pardon me if I express my very earnest hope that the suffrage\r\namendment to the constitution of the United States may be ratified by\r\nthe great State of Alabama. It would constitute a very happy augury\r\nfor the future and add greatly to the strength of a movement which, in\r\nmy judgment, is based upon the highest consideration both of justice\r\nand expedience.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same date Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels sent a long\r\nmessage to Mrs. McNeel, chairman of the Ratification Committee, and a\r\nmultigraphed copy to each member of the Senate, setting forth the\r\nmerits of the amendment and saying: \"The South has nothing to fear\r\nfrom the amendment but it would be a loss to southern chivalry and\r\nsouthern prestige if our section of the country halted this great\r\nreform. I earnestly hope that the people of Alabama will take the lead\r\nof southern States east of the Mississippi and follow the wise\r\nleadership of Texas and Missouri and other progressive commonwealths.\r\nThere is no doubt of its ratification. Let Alabama lead and not\r\nfollow.\" Homer S. Cummings, chairman of the Democratic National\r\nCommittee, and other prominent Democrats added their earnest appeals\r\nto the Senate for favorable action.\r\n\r\nThe ratifying resolution was introduced in the Senate by John A.\r\nRogers and in the House by W. H. Shaw. The date set for the vote in\r\nthe Senate was July 17 and a hearing before a joint meeting of Senate\r\nand House was granted on the 16th. Women journeyed to Montgomery from\r\nnearly every county to plead for the amendment but its defeat had\r\nalready been planned. The vote was 13 ayes, 19 noes.\r\n\r\nThe House did not act on the measure until September 17 and during the\r\ninterim every possible pressure was made on its members to obtain a\r\nfavorable vote. President Wilson sent an urgent telegram to Speaker H.\r\nP. Merritt. Chairman Nesbit convened the State Democratic Committee on\r\nAugust 21 to consider the amendment. It adopted a resolution by a vote\r\nof 20 to 13, which endorsed the favorable action of the National\r\nCommittee the preceding May and said: \"We pledge our support in every\r\nproper way to accomplish the result desired.\" Mrs. George Bass,\r\nchairman of the Women's National Democratic Committee, went to\r\nMontgomery for this meeting and remained several days working for the\r\namendment. The Central Labor Union of that city at a mass meeting\r\npassed a resolution asking the Legislature to \"take steps immediately\r\nto ratify the amendment.\" A majority of the House were pledged to vote\r\nin favor of ratification but after it had been defeated in the Senate\r\nthey considered it useless to keep their promise and the vote was 31\r\nayes, 60 noes.\r\n\r\nThe Governor and Lieutenant Governor Nathan L. Miller maintained a\r\nneutral position. The mainspring of the opposition from beginning to\r\nend was U. S. Senator Oscar W. Underwood. Senator John H. Bankhead was\r\nequally opposed. Both Senators had voted against the submission of the\r\nFederal Amendment and of the ten members in the Lower House only one,\r\nWilliam B. Oliver of Tuscaloosa, had voted in favor.[4]\r\n\r\nBecause of the campaign no convention took place in 1919. On April\r\n8-9, 1920, the last one of the State Equal Suffrage Association, as\r\nsuch, was held in Montgomery. A large \"pioneer luncheon\" was given in\r\nthe Exchange Hotel and a beautiful set of silver baskets was presented\r\nto Mrs. Jacobs. The sessions were held in the Senate chamber of the\r\nhistoric Capitol and by unanimous consent the association was merged\r\ninto the State League of Women Voters. Mrs. A. J. Bowron was elected\r\nchairman.\r\n\r\nAfter the amendment was finally ratified by the necessary 36 States\r\nthere was a victory parade in Birmingham in which 1,500 took part. A\r\nbrass band headed 36 automobiles, each a mass of banners, flags and\r\nflowers, labeled in the order in which the States ratified. Mrs.\r\nJacobs and the pioneers led the marchers, followed by professional and\r\nbusiness women, the League of Women Voters, the Woman's Christian\r\nTemperance Union and other organizations. It ended with addresses and\r\nsinging in Capitol Park.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Pattie Ruffner\r\nJacobs, eight years president of the State Equal Suffrage Association,\r\nthree years auditor of the National Association and now secretary of\r\nthe National League of Women Voters; also to Miss Helen J. Benners,\r\nresearch chairman of the State League of Women Voters.\r\n\r\n[2] Those who held office in the State association during the next\r\neight years were as follows: Mrs. Milton Humes, Mrs. Frederick D.\r\nLosey, Mrs. Parke, Mrs. Angus Taylor, Mrs. J. D. Wilkins, Mrs. W. J.\r\nChambers, Miss Annie Joe Coates, Mrs. John Lusk, Mrs. Leon Weil.\r\n\r\n[3] On June 17, 1919, Mrs. James S. Pinckard called a meeting of women\r\nof wealth and social standing at her home in Montgomery. With the help\r\nof a constitutional lawyer they organized the Southern Women's\r\nAnti-Ratification League, with Mrs. Pinckard chairman, Mrs. Charles\r\nHenderson, vice-chairman; Mrs. W. T. Sheehan, secretary; Mrs. Marie\r\nBankhead Owen (daughter of the Senator), chairman of the Legislative\r\nCommittee. Members of the Executive Committee were Mesdames Charles S.\r\nThigpen, Hails Janney, Jack Thorington, J. A. Winter, Ormond\r\nSomerville, W. J. Hannah, Clayton T. Tullis, J. Winter Thorington, E.\r\nPerry Thomas, William M. E. Ellsberry, J.H. Naftel, W. B. Kelly and\r\nMiss Mae Harris. They sent a memorial to the Legislature which began:\r\n\"We look with confidence to you to protect us from this device of\r\nnorthern Abolitionists.\" They \"worked night and day, personally and by\r\nletter,\" and, after the defeat of ratification in the Alabama\r\nLegislature, Mrs. Pinckard and others transferred their efforts to\r\nthose of Louisiana and Tennessee, where they \"lobbied\" for many days.\r\n\r\n[4] Among the men in the State who were especially active and helpful\r\nwere: Colonel Bibb Graves and John H. Wallace, of Montgomery; L. B.\r\nMusgrove, of Jasper; Judge W. R. Chapman, of Dothan; H. H. Patterson,\r\nof Atmore; John W. Abercrombie, of Anniston; John D. McNeel, Phil\r\nPainter, Ex-Governor B. B. Comer, James Weatherly, Fred M. Jackson and\r\nJohn R. Hornaday of Birmingham.\r\n\r\nAmong those especially active in opposition were: Congressman John H.\r\nBankhead, Jr., of Jasper; C. Brooks Smith, Judge John R. Tyson and Ray\r\nRushton, of Montgomery; R. A. Mitchell, of Gadsden; Wiley Tunstall and\r\nLen F. Greer, of Anniston; Judge Joe Evans, Martin Calhoun and Joe\r\nGreen, of Selma; W. W. Brandon, of Tuscaloosa; John D. Leigh, of\r\nBrewton; Emmett O'Neal and E. D. Smith, of Birmingham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nARIZONA.[5]\r\n\r\n\r\nSince this chapter is to commence with the year 1900, this will be\r\nwhere Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt and Miss Mary Garrett Hay, chairman and\r\nmember of the Organization Committee of the National American Woman\r\nSuffrage Association left off in the spring of 1899 after they had\r\nspent a month laboring with the Territorial Legislature. They\r\nsucceeded in getting a bill through the Lower House by a vote of two\r\nto one but by the deciding vote of Morris Goldwater of Prescott,\r\npresident of the Council or Upper House, it was sent to a committee\r\nand prevented from coming to a vote. The hand of the \"boss\" of the\r\nsaloon-keepers was clearly recognized in the game that was played.\r\n\r\nUndaunted Mrs. Catt and Miss Hay came back in 1900 and organized the\r\nfirst full-fledged suffrage association in the Territory, with Mrs.\r\nPauline O'Neill, wife of that staunch suffrage friend, the gallant\r\nRough Rider, William O'Neill, as its president; Mrs. Lida P. Robinson,\r\ncorresponding secretary; Mrs. Frances W. Munds, recording secretary,\r\nMrs. Porter of Phoenix, treasurer. All were inexperienced and the\r\nsociety did not flourish and although 1900 was election year no\r\npre-election pledges were obtained. A Territorial Legislature can\r\nextend suffrage to women without referring the question to the voters.\r\nA bill for this purpose was introduced in 1901 through a committee of\r\nwomen headed by Mrs. Robinson but it received little support and after\r\ncreating the usual amount of excitement failed to pass either House.\r\n\r\nDuring the following year suffrage work seemed to lapse and the\r\norganization would have died a natural death but for the will of Mrs.\r\nRobinson, who called a convention to meet in Phoenix in the spring of\r\n1902, where she was elected president with Mrs. Munds corresponding\r\nand recording secretary and Mrs. Ada Irving treasurer. Under Mrs.\r\nRobinson's guidance a list was made of all who had previously\r\nexpressed an interest and they were notified that something was doing\r\nin the suffrage line. Dr. Frances Woods of Kansas was sent by the\r\nNational Association and made a tour of the Territory which was\r\nremarkable for the haste in which it was made and the results\r\nobtained. She organized clubs in every county and set the women to\r\nwork obtaining pre-election pledges, with the result that when the\r\nLegislature convened in the spring of 1903 it lacked only a few votes\r\nof having a majority in both Houses pledged to suffrage. Mrs.\r\nRobinson, Dr. Woods and Mrs. Munds constituted themselves a committee\r\nto work with the members and succeeded in getting a woman suffrage\r\nbill through the Legislature by a two-thirds vote. The rejoicing was\r\nshort, for the Governor, Alexander O. Brodie, an appointee of\r\nPresident Roosevelt, vetoed the bill. Representatives Kean St.\r\nCharles, a newspaper man, and Morrison, a labor leader, were most\r\nactive in its behalf, while the scheme that finally sent it down to\r\ndefeat was concocted, it was said, by Joseph H. Kibbey, a lawyer of\r\nPhoenix. He was the leader of the Republican minority in the Council\r\nand traded its solid Republican vote for one needed vote on another\r\nbill, with the understanding that the Governor would veto the suffrage\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nGovernor Brodie afterwards resigned and Mr. Kibbey, the arch-enemy of\r\nwoman suffrage, was appointed in his place. Mrs. Robinson continued\r\npropaganda through a little paper which she published and distributed\r\nherself throughout the Territory. This well-edited paper kept alive\r\nthe favorable sentiment and through it the leading men and women\r\nsuffragists in Arizona were in touch with each other. In the spring of\r\n1905 Mrs. Mary C. C. Bradford of Denver was sent by the National\r\nAssociation and spent several weeks working with the Legislature but\r\nreceived practically no cooperation from the local women, as it was\r\nconceded that the situation was hopeless while Kibbey was Governor.\r\nMrs. Robinson moved from the Territory and the organization was\r\nwithout a head. It languished for about three years and its enemies\r\nsang cheerful requiems for the dead. The Legislature that met in 1907\r\nhad a peaceful time as far as women were concerned for no suffrage\r\nbill was introduced.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1909, Miss Laura Clay of Kentucky, an officer of the\r\nNational Association, came to Arizona at her own expense. The last\r\nTerritorial Legislature was then in session and Miss Clay labored long\r\nand faithfully with it but the resident women were apathetic and gave\r\nher little assistance. The bill that she had introduced failed in both\r\nHouses, the members availing themselves of the excuse that Arizona\r\nwomen did not want suffrage or they would make some organized effort\r\nto get it. Miss Clay had the right kind of spirit and gathering a\r\nfaithful few together they worked out a plan whereby the first really\r\nefficient suffrage organization was effected. This plan was the same\r\nas the political parties in the Territory used, namely, a State\r\nchairman with a chairman in each county and a chairman for each local\r\nclub. A convention was called in Phoenix under Miss Clay's direction\r\nand Mrs. Munds was made Territorial chairman. During the year\r\nstatehood for Arizona began to loom up and vigorous work was done for\r\nthat event. The National Association sent the very woman needed, Miss\r\nLaura Gregg of Kansas. She made an extensive tour of the Territory and\r\nby the time Congress had passed the Enabling Act in June, 1910, it was\r\nthoroughly organized with suffrage clubs in every county and in all of\r\nthe larger towns and cities, with a membership of about 3,000 men and\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nStrenuous effort was made to have a majority of the members of the\r\nConstitutional Convention pledged to vote for a suffrage plank but it\r\nsucceeded with only about a third of them. It met in October, 1910,\r\nwith eleven Republican and thirty-three Democratic members. Through\r\nthe demands of organized labor backed by a heavy labor vote a very\r\nprogressive constitution was written. Miss Gregg and Mrs. Munds\r\nstruggled with the delegates during its entire session to have a full,\r\npartial or conditional woman suffrage clause incorporated but to no\r\navail. Members who proudly proclaimed themselves the only original\r\n\"progressives\" were far too timid to put anything so \"radical\" as\r\nwoman suffrage in the constitution for fear that the voters would not\r\naccept it, and yet those same men wrote into it the initiative and\r\nreferendum, recall of judges and many other far more radical measures\r\nand it was adopted by an overwhelming majority. It was plain that a\r\nmeasure was deemed radical or not according to the voting power behind\r\nit. The Republicans were in a minority and only two voted for the\r\nsuffrage clause, although there were enough Democratic pledges to have\r\ncarried it with the solid Republican support. The Republicans were for\r\na \"safe and sane\" constitution, something like the one adopted at the\r\nsame time by New Mexico, under which women never could get suffrage by\r\nState process. One Democrat who offered \"to do and die for it\" in the\r\nconvention was Senator Fred Colter of Apache County.\r\n\r\nNot at all discouraged by the defeat the women, now aroused and\r\ninterested, began as soon as the constitution was accepted by the\r\nvoters and statehood was effected to get ready for the first State\r\nelection, as now it was necessary to have an amendment submitted by\r\nthe Legislature and accepted by the electors. Headquarters were\r\nestablished in the house of Mrs. Munds at Prescott and a constant\r\nstream of literature and correspondence went out in an effort to elect\r\nsuffragists to the first State Legislature. The men, however, were so\r\npleased with the members of the Constitutional Convention that a\r\nlittle thing like their voting against woman suffrage did not matter\r\nand every one who was a candidate for anything was elected, some to\r\nthe Legislature and others to the various State offices. George W. P.\r\nHunt, who was president of the convention and had vigorously opposed\r\nthe suffrage plank, was elected the first Governor of the State. He\r\ndid recommend in his message to the Legislature that it submit a woman\r\nsuffrage amendment to the voters. Senator John Hughes, son of former\r\nGovernor and Mrs. L. C. Hughes, who had done so much to obtain woman\r\nsuffrage in early territorial days, prepared and introduced such a\r\nmeasure but it failed in both Houses. The Legislature was 90 per cent.\r\nDemocratic.\r\n\r\nIt was then determined to use the initiative and collect the requisite\r\nnumber of names on a petition that would compel the Legislature to\r\nsubmit the question. Women in every county volunteered to get these\r\nsignatures, fifty or sixty altogether, and did the drudgery of\r\ncanvassing until the required number of signatures were obtained.\r\n\r\nAfter a year's continuous educational work, in September, 1912, the\r\nNational Association was notified that Arizona was ready for the final\r\ncontest and asked to send Miss Gregg. She came and again campaigned\r\nthe State and through her efforts every labor organization pledged its\r\nsupport. Mrs. Alice Park of Palo Alto, California, came at her own\r\nexpense and took charge of the distribution of literature. Mrs. Munds\r\nwent to Phoenix and opened headquarters in the Adams Hotel and ten\r\nweeks were spent in a most strenuous campaign. The National\r\nAssociation contributed Miss Gregg's salary and expenses, nearly\r\n$1,000, and $200 in cash. The rest of the campaign fund was raised in\r\nArizona with the exception of voluntary contributions from suffrage\r\norganizations in other States. Dr. Shaw came and spoke for a week in\r\nthe principal cities, making a tremendous impression. The press with\r\none or two exceptions was favorable and gave generous space. The press\r\nwork was in charge of Miss Sally Jacobs and Mrs. Maybelle Craig of\r\nPhoenix. State Senator H. A. Davis did splendid campaign work and\r\nloyal men and women too numerous to mention gave freely of their time\r\nand money.\r\n\r\nOn November 5 the amendment received 13,442 ayes, 6,202 noes, a\r\nmajority of more than two to one. Every county was carried. The vote\r\nwas small, as most Mexicans were disfranchised by an educational\r\nrequirement.\r\n\r\nThe campaign was conducted without parades or demonstrations of any\r\nkind and the saloon-keepers, not realizing the strength of the\r\nsuffragists, paid no attention to them until the closing days, then\r\nsuddenly woke up and put forth strong efforts to defeat them but they\r\nwere too well organized. The campaign closed with no deficit on the\r\nbooks. Later a League of Women Voters was formed and Mrs. M. T. Phelps\r\nof Phoenix was elected chairman.\r\n\r\nThe first State Legislature completely revised the civil and criminal\r\ncodes of Arizona and without any demand on the part of the women\r\nincorporated some excellent laws for women and children. Since then\r\nothers have been added, partly through the efforts of women\r\nlegislators.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. Women have taken so active a part and have been so\r\ngenerally accepted in the political life of the State that it caused\r\nscarcely a ripple of excitement when a special session of the\r\nLegislature was called by Governor Thomas E. Campbell for the purpose\r\nof ratifying the Federal Woman Suffrage Amendment. It convened at noon\r\nFeb. 12, 1920, and adjourned at 9:30 p. m. of the same day. The\r\nresolution for ratification was introduced jointly by the four women\r\nmembers and passed both Houses without a dissenting vote. Protests\r\nfrom Mrs. Mabel G. Millard and Mrs. Frances Williams of the Iowa and\r\nVirginia Associations Opposed to Woman Suffrage were listened to in\r\nthe Senate with good-natured amusement.\r\n\r\nIn the second Legislature of the new State, the first after women were\r\nenfranchised, Mrs. Frances W. Munds of Prescott served as Senator and\r\nMrs. Rachel Berry of St. Johns as Representative. The third had in the\r\nLower House Mrs. Rosa McKay of Globe, Mrs. Theodora Marsh of Nogales\r\nand Mrs. Pauline O'Neill of Phoenix. The fourth had Mrs. McKay and\r\nMrs. H. H. Westover of Yuma.\r\n\r\nAbout ten times as many women as men are teachers in the public\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Frances W. Munds,\r\npresident of the State Woman Suffrage Association until women were\r\nenfranchised and then elected State Senator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nARKANSAS.[6]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was little general suffrage activity in Arkansas before 1911;\r\nperhaps the only specific work after 1900 was an occasional article\r\nwritten by Mrs. Chester Jennings of Little Rock and published in\r\nvarious papers in the State. She was called \"the keeper of the light.\"\r\nArkansas was not affiliated with the National American Association\r\nprior to 1913, there was only correspondence between individual\r\nsuffragists and national officers.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1911, the Political Equality League was organized in\r\nLittle Rock. This organization came about indirectly as a result of an\r\narticle written by Mrs. D. D. Terry of this city and published on the\r\nfront page of the _Arkansas Gazette_, the largest paper in the State.\r\nIt was in answer to a scathing criticism of women by another paper for\r\nattending the trial of a child victim and was a demand that the\r\nsuffrage should be given to women.\r\n\r\nImmediately following this occurrence Mrs. J. W. Markwell called a\r\npublic meeting in one of the Methodist churches to discuss this\r\nquestion. She was chairman and Mrs. Rice, Mrs. Terry, Mrs. L. B.\r\nLeigh, Mrs. Minnie Rutherford Fuller and members of the Woman's\r\nChristian Temperance Union and the College Women's Club, almost to a\r\nunit suffragists, were among the prominent women present. They were\r\ndeeply stirred and as the Legislature was in session they asked for a\r\nhearing. This was granted by the Judiciary Committee and they were\r\ncourteously received, as they stated their desire. They went from the\r\nhearing into one of the committee rooms of the Capitol and decided to\r\nform a woman suffrage society. The same women with a few others met in\r\nthe home of Mrs. Markwell that evening. Miss Julia McAlmont Warner\r\nwas made chairman and the following officers were elected: President,\r\nMiss Mary Fletcher; vice-president, Mrs. W. P. Hutton; secretary, Mrs.\r\nJennings; treasurer, Miss Warner, and the name adopted was Woman's\r\nPolitical Equality League. It started with $20 in the treasury--of\r\nwhich $3 were paid by men--Dr. J. W. Markwell, Mr. Boyer and Clio\r\nHarper.\r\n\r\nThe semi-monthly meetings were first held in the public library, one\r\nin the afternoon, the other at night, so that working women, teachers\r\nand men might attend. The president soon went to Europe and the work\r\npassed into the capable hands of Mrs. Hutton. One of the most valuable\r\nhelpers was Rabbi L. Witt, who always attended and helped out many a\r\nprogram. Leagues were formed in Hot Springs and Pine Bluff and these\r\nwere the only three prior to 1913 when a State association was\r\norganized.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1913, Mrs. O. F. Ellington was elected president of the\r\nLittle Rock League. At that time it was holding its meetings in the\r\nChamber of Commerce and few people would climb two flights of stairs\r\nto hear a subject discussed in which there was little interest, so the\r\nexecutive board secured the parlors of the City Hall. If the women\r\ncould accomplish as much in the offices of the City Hall as they did\r\nin the parlors no fair-minded person would have objected to their\r\noccupancy. Important local, State and national affairs were studied\r\nand discussed and prominent State and national speakers addressed that\r\neager body of women.\r\n\r\nUnder the auspices of the league the first national suffrage May day\r\nwas observed in Little Rock with speeches from the steps of the Old\r\nState House. Seventy-five letters were sent out to prominent men in\r\nthe State, asking them to make five-minute speeches and after ten days\r\nDr. L. P. Gibson, the well-known physician, was the first to accept.\r\nThe next morning the _Arkansas Gazette_ told that Dr. Gibson of Little\r\nRock would be one of the speakers and then every man who could arrange\r\nto be in town that day accepted his invitation. Among the women who\r\nspoke were Mrs. George Pratho, Mrs. Fuller, Mrs. C. E. Rose, Mrs. T.\r\nT. Cotnam, Miss Julia Warner, Miss Josephine Miller, Mrs. George E.\r\nCunningham, Mrs. Terry, Mrs. S. S. Wassel, Mrs. E. W. Gibb, Mrs. W.\r\nG. Whipple, Mrs. A. Marinana. The intensely interested crowd stood two\r\nhours and a half earnestly listening to these leading citizens asking\r\nthe right of suffrage for Arkansas women.\r\n\r\nIt had been the custom to disband during the summer months but the\r\nsummer of 1914 the Political Equality League opened a class for the\r\npurpose of studying all the questions of the day and learning\r\nsomething about speaking extemporaneously. In response to a call from\r\nthe president, Little Rock and Hot Springs sent representatives to a\r\nconference held in the former city for the purpose of devising ways\r\nand means of forming a State association. An organization committee\r\nwas formed of the following: Mrs. Ellington, Miss Fletcher, Miss Mary\r\nHouse, Mrs. Rose, Mrs. Leigh, Mrs. Jennings, all of Little Rock; Miss\r\nAdele Johnson of Hot Springs. In October the State Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation was formed in Little Rock at Hotel Marion, with six\r\nleagues represented by the following presidents: Hot Springs, Miss\r\nMary Spargo; Pine Bluff, Mrs. L. K. Land; Augusta, Mrs. Rufus\r\nFitzhugh; Malvern, Mrs. Mary Jackson; Hardy, Mrs. S. A. Turner;\r\nFayetteville, Mrs. LeRoy Palmer. The officers elected were, President,\r\nMrs. Ellington; first vice-president, Mrs. Fuller, Magazine; second,\r\nMrs. N. F. Drake, Fayetteville; corresponding secretary, Mrs. P. J.\r\nHenry, Hot Springs; recording secretary, Mrs. Cunningham, Little Rock;\r\ntreasurer, Mrs. Cotnam, Little Rock.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1915, the first annual meeting took place in Little Rock,\r\neleven counties being represented, and this board was re-elected. The\r\nprincipal business of this convention was to lay plans for the\r\nlegislative work early in the following year.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1916, the second annual convention was held in Pine Bluff,\r\nits principal work being to devise ways and means of raising money for\r\ncontinuing the organization of the State. Mrs. Cotman presented a\r\nfeasible plan for raising money which was accepted by the convention.\r\nNew officers elected were second vice-president, Mrs. J. D. Head,\r\nTexarkana; third vice-president, Mrs. J. H. Reynolds, Conway;\r\ncorresponding secretary, Mrs. Maud O. Clemmons; recording secretary,\r\nMrs. G. D. Henderson, both of Little Rock. Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,\r\npresident of the National American Suffrage Association, had come to\r\nLittle Rock in April and spoken most acceptably to a large audience.\r\nShe held a conference with the State officers and later the\r\nassociation financed a two-months' campaign for organization. Miss\r\nGertrude Watkins and Miss Josephine Miller of Little Rock gave their\r\nservices for their expenses only and organized sixty committees.[7]\r\n\r\nThe new Primary law was almost equal to the full suffrage, as where\r\none party is so largely in the majority the primaries decide the\r\nelections, and it gave a great impetus to the movement throughout the\r\ncountry, especially in the southern States.\r\n\r\nAfter the Primary bill passed the suffragists re-organized along the\r\nlines of the State Democratic party. Where it had a State Central\r\nCommittee they had an Equal Suffrage State Central Committee and so on\r\nthrough the organization. The object was to teach women how to work\r\nthrough and with political parties but they were not fully\r\nenfranchised and could not give up their suffrage organization,\r\ntherefore they held together on semi-political but non-partisan lines\r\nuntil such time as they could go into the various parties.\r\n\r\nAt the close of Mrs. Ellington's administration in August, 1917,\r\nseventy-eight papers in the State were handling news items each week.\r\nEighty-five organizations had been completed. The Primary bill had\r\nbeen passed by the Legislature and thousands of women had assessed\r\nthemselves and paid their poll tax of one dollar a year preparatory to\r\nvoting in the spring elections. Under the law the assessor can put\r\nthis tax only on male citizens and the women in asking for the Primary\r\nsuffrage voluntarily assumed it, as no one can vote until it is paid.\r\nThis was held to be legal by Attorney General John D. Arbuckle.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ellington left Arkansas on August 1 and Mrs. Cotnam was elected\r\nby the State Board to take charge of affairs. On November 28 she was\r\nelected chairman of the State Suffrage Central Committee upon the\r\nreceipt of Mrs. Ellington's formal resignation. Mrs. Cotnam appeared\r\nbefore the State Farmers' Union in August and secured a unanimous\r\nendorsement of woman suffrage and in September at the meeting of its\r\nexecutive committee she secured a resolution calling on Arkansas\r\nSenators and Representatives to vote for the Federal Amendment. She\r\nwent to New York City in September to take part in the State suffrage\r\ncampaign. After six weeks she returned to Little Rock, where the great\r\nvictory won in New York was celebrated at a luncheon in the Marion\r\nHotel. Governor Charles H. Brough was a speaker and prophesied a\r\nsimilar victory in Arkansas.\r\n\r\nDr. Shaw visited Arkansas for the first time on April 3, 1918, and\r\nspoke to an immense audience. She came under the auspices of the\r\nNational Council of Defense, as chairman of the Woman's Committee, but\r\nshe won many friends for suffrage and the sincere admiration of all.\r\n\r\nActive work to assure the writing of woman suffrage in the new State\r\nconstitution culminated at the first annual meeting of the Equal\r\nSuffrage Central Committee on April 2, 1918, when a close organization\r\ncovering the State was perfected. At this meeting Mrs. Cotnam was\r\nre-elected chairman; Mrs. C. T. Drennen of Hot Springs first\r\nvice-chairman; Mrs. Stella Brizzolara of Fort Smith second\r\nvice-chairman; Mrs. Frank W. Gibb, secretary; Mrs. R. W. Walker of\r\nLittle Rock, treasurer. The National American Association contributed\r\n$1,675 to the campaign. The constitutional convention met the first\r\nMonday in July and the suffrage clause was adopted on the third day of\r\nthe session. Only one man spoke and finally voted against this clause\r\nbut it was not acceptable to the majority until amended to make jury\r\nservice for women optional. The suffragists were consulted and agreed\r\nbecause it was plain that a refusal might cause a long drawn out\r\ndebate. The constitution was defeated at a special election on Dec.\r\n13, 1918, but it was generally conceded that the opposition caused by\r\nthe suffrage amendment was negligible.\r\n\r\nThe first State-wide Primary election in which women had the right to\r\nvote was held in May, 1918; between 40,000 and 50,000 voted and all\r\npapers commented on the intelligence of the new electors. The State\r\nDemocratic convention met in Little Rock on July 10 and for the first\r\ntime women delegates were present from many counties. Fifty were\r\nseated and more were present in proportion to their representation\r\nthan were men. They attended in force all minor committee meetings and\r\ncontrolled the action of some of these committees. The _Arkansas\r\nGazette_ of July 11 commented: \"It may safely be said that nothing was\r\nput over on them by the wily politicians. There wasn't a chance--not a\r\nchance in the world.\" There were women on the platform, the\r\nresolutions and all prominent committees. The suffrage plank, as\r\nwritten by the women, was unanimously adopted and for the first time a\r\nwoman was elected member of the State Central Committee, Mrs.\r\nBrizzolara. The one appointed as a member of the Democratic Women's\r\nNational Committee was Mrs. Head, chairman of her congressional\r\ndistrict for the suffrage organization.\r\n\r\nOn January 14 resolutions were introduced in the Senate by Senator Lee\r\nCazort and the House by Representative J. D. Doyle, memorializing the\r\nSenate of the United States to submit the Federal Amendment. They\r\npassed unanimously and later were read into the Congressional Record\r\nby Senator W. F. Kirby.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. As soon as the Federal Amendment passed, letters were\r\nsent to legislators asking them to agree to a call for a special\r\nsession. In less than one week answers were received from a majority\r\nexpressing willingness and even eagerness to hold the ratification\r\nsession. Many offered to pay their own expenses and waive the regular\r\nper diem. With this support in hand a committee of fifty women went to\r\nthe State House and asked Governor Brough to call a special session.\r\nThis he agreed to do and set the date for July 28. While the\r\nsuffragists were never in doubt of ratification they were genuinely\r\nsurprised to find a few real enemies in the House and to hear some of\r\nthe moss-grown arguments of 1911. The Senate ratified by a vote of 29\r\nto two and the House by 74 to 15. Henry Ponder of Lawrence county\r\nintroduced the resolution in the Senate and said he believed his\r\nchildren would be prouder of that act of his than of anything else he\r\nmight ever do. An identical resolution was introduced in the House by\r\nRepresentatives Riggs, Joe Joiner, Carl Held, Neil Bohlinger and J.\r\nD. Doyle. The Senate resolution passed first and went over to the\r\nHouse. The two Senators who voted against it were W. L. Ward, Lee\r\ncounty, and W. H. Latimer, Sevier county. Many women came from over\r\nthe State to this special session and filled the galleries.\r\n\r\nOn Dec. 3, 1919, at the second annual meeting the Equal Suffrage\r\nCentral Committee was merged into a State League of Women Voters and\r\nMrs. Cotnam was elected chairman.\r\n\r\nWhile the suffragists were working for the vote they confined their\r\norganized effort to that one measure but it is significant that the\r\nsame Legislature that passed the Primary bill, gave women the right to\r\npractice law and provided for a Girls' Industrial School; that of 1915\r\nremoved all legal disabilities of married women.\r\n\r\nMiss Josephine Miller and Miss Gertrude Watkins of Little Rock are on\r\nthe staff of national organizers and Mrs. Cotnam has served as\r\ninstructor in suffrage schools and also as a speaker in twenty States.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION: 1911. In January Representatives Grant of Newport\r\nand Whittington of Hot Springs introduced an equal suffrage resolution\r\nin the House. It was not initiated by the suffragists and apparently\r\nnot introduced to advance woman suffrage, as it was said to contain a\r\n\"joker.\" Nevertheless, when it became known that the bill had been\r\nintroduced they appealed to Representative Hearst of Fayetteville,\r\nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, for a hearing. On the day and\r\nhour that it had been promised Mrs. Chester Jennings, Mrs. J. W.\r\nMarkwell, Miss Julia Warner, Mrs. Rutherford Fuller and Mrs. D. D.\r\nTerry went to the Capitol but were unable to find either Mr. Hearst or\r\nhis committee. On March 11, however, the committee met at the Marion\r\nHotel, as it was customary to hold committee meetings at night in the\r\nhotel, and a hearing was granted to the women. Miss Olive Gatlin (now\r\nMrs. Leigh) and Mrs. Fuller made excellent speeches which seemed to\r\nmake an impression. Later the suffrage resolution was reported to the\r\nHouse and received six favorable votes.\r\n\r\n1913. House joint resolution giving women the right to vote was\r\nintroduced by Robert Martin. This year the suffragists had a most\r\nsuccessful hearing before the House Committee on Constitutional\r\nAmendments. The president of the Senate, W. K. Oldham, Lonoke; Judge\r\nW. L. Moose, Morrillton, and Rabbi L. Witt, Little Rock, made eloquent\r\npleas in addition to those of the women. The committee reported the\r\nresolution favorably and the vote was 35 for, 55 against.\r\n\r\nBetween the two Legislatures the State Woman Suffrage Association was\r\nformed and its influence was immediately felt in political circles.\r\n\r\n1915. Senator George W. Garrett, Okolona, introduced a joint\r\nresolution proposing an amendment to the constitution giving women\r\nfull suffrage and it passed by 23 to 12. The House called a night\r\nsession for the third reading. A resolution signed by Representatives\r\nYearger of Chico county, Dunlap of Phillips and Wilson of Jefferson to\r\nallow a representative of the Woman Suffrage Association ten minutes\r\nin which to present the reasons for the enfranchisement of women\r\npassed and Mrs. Cotnam was introduced, the first woman ever given the\r\nprivilege of the floor. The vote was 51 in favor, 18 opposed, with 31\r\nabsent. The amendment failed to get on the ballot, as under the\r\nArkansas law only three amendments could be submitted at one election\r\nand the next morning before this one could be properly recorded the\r\nFederation of Labor had filed an initiated amendment with the\r\nSecretary of State and that for suffrage became the fourth. The\r\nsuffragists tried to get the Federation of Labor to withdraw their\r\namendment, which had no chance of being adopted, but were unsuccessful\r\nand it did fail at the general election.\r\n\r\n1917. On January 11 Representative John A. Riggs of Hot Springs\r\nintroduced a joint resolution for the amendment, signed by himself, C.\r\nB. Andrews of Nevada county, Stephen P. Meador of Clark and Carl W.\r\nHeld of Sebastian. Mrs. Ellington, president of the State Suffrage\r\nAssociation, explained to them that it had entered into an agreement\r\nwith all other State associations at the last national suffrage\r\nconvention not to go into a referendum campaign without the consent of\r\nthe National Board, if they expected financial assistance from that\r\norganization, and the resolution was withdrawn. On February 7\r\nRepresentative Riggs introduced what was known as the Primary Bill,\r\nwhich in brief was as follows: \"An Act to provide that women may vote\r\nin all primary elections: From and after the passage of this act and\r\nsubject to all the provisions of the laws of this State as to age,\r\nresidence, citizenship, payment of poll taxes and otherwise regulating\r\nthe manner and form of holding the same, but especially exempt from\r\nevery disqualification, direct or indirect, on account of sex, every\r\nwoman shall have the right to vote at any primary election held under\r\nthe laws of this State.\"\r\n\r\nThis form of suffrage is unique and deserves some explanation. William\r\nHodges, Associate Justice of the Court of Civil Appeals, Texarkana,\r\nTexas, suggested the idea to Senator O. S. Lattimore of Fort Worth,\r\nwho formulated the bill of which the Arkansas bill is substantially a\r\ncopy. The Texas Legislature defeated it. Mr. Riggs wired for a copy of\r\nthe bill, had a similar one drawn and submitted it to U. S. Senator\r\nKirby and a number of prominent lawyers, all of whom were unanimous in\r\nthe belief that it was constitutional. Justice Hodges said, \"I have\r\nfelt deep interest in the suffrage question for several years and the\r\nidea of permitting women to participate in Primary elections occurred\r\nto me casually as I was thinking of how to meet the stubborn\r\nopposition offered in the Texas Legislature to the submission of an\r\namendment to the constitution.\"[8] Mr. Riggs said his eagerness to\r\npass a suffrage bill was to do justice to the women of Arkansas and to\r\nkeep a promise to his mother that if he ever was elected to the\r\nLegislature he would introduce and work for one.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of 1917 was soon discovered to be a progressive\r\nassembly and gave promise of success for the bill. Mrs. Ellington\r\ndecided the time had come to adopt business methods in the suffrage\r\nlobby and undertook with Mr. Riggs the whole responsibility of guiding\r\nthis bill on its eventful journey through the House and Senate. The\r\nsuffragists held themselves in readiness to do any special work\r\nneeded, which they did quietly and effectively, seeing legislators\r\nwhen necessary, but the Legislature was not harassed by a large and\r\nconspicuous lobby.[9]\r\n\r\nSufficient pledges were secured in both House and Senate before the\r\nbill was allowed to come even to a test vote. Judge Josiah Hardage,\r\nArkadelphia, assisted by W. J. Waggoner of Lonoke and James A. Choate\r\nof Floyd, led the opposition in the House and conducted the bitterest\r\nfight waged during the session. Sixteen men stood solidly with them in\r\nall parliamentary tactics in hopes of killing the bill. Nineteen men\r\ncould delay it but they were destined to defeat when 78 men, led by\r\nthe astute floor leader, J. O. Johnson of Sebastian county, were\r\ndetermined that it should pass. After several hours' debate the House\r\npassed the bill February 15 by 71 ayes, 19 noes, 10 absent.\r\n\r\nWhen the bill came up in the Senate Walker Smith of Magnolia led the\r\nopposition, although several days before he had promised Mrs. Head and\r\nMrs. Ellington to vote for it. Senator Houston Emory of Hot Springs\r\nguided it to a successful vote on February 27--17 ayes, 15 noes.\r\nSenators George F. Brown of Rison, George W. Garrett of Okolona, H. L.\r\nPonder of Walnut Ridge, J. S. Utley of Benton and R. Hill Caruth of\r\nWarren aided materially in passing the bill. The first time during the\r\nsession that every man in the Senate was in his seat to vote was when\r\nthe Primary bill came up. Two Senators unalterably opposed to woman\r\nsuffrage had been expelled for bribery and this made its success\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe Senate slightly amended the bill and returned it to the House,\r\nwhich accepted it March 6. Never did a man serve the cause of suffrage\r\nmore loyally or more efficiently than John A. Riggs and the women of\r\nArkansas owe him a lasting debt of gratitude. Governor Brough signed\r\nthe bill in the evening at a public meeting amid great enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature met Jan. 13, 1919, after thousands of women had voted\r\nat the Primary election. Not one member had been asked to present a\r\nresolution proposing a constitutional amendment for woman suffrage. In\r\nfact the women were following closely the advice of the National\r\nAssociation and were ardently hoping to avoid a State campaign. They\r\nwere reckoning from past experiences but times had changed.\r\nTwenty-five men came ready to propose a full suffrage amendment;\r\nRepresentative Riggs, the father of the Primary bill, was the first\r\nman on the floor after the House was organized and his bill got first\r\nplace on the calendar. It passed the Senate January 30 by 27 to one,\r\nand the House February 3 by 73 to three. In November it went to the\r\nvoters and was defeated. It received the largest favorable vote of any\r\nof the amendments submitted but not a majority of the largest number\r\ncast at the election, as required by the constitution. The women had\r\nfelt certain that this would be impossible. In August, 1920, full\r\nsuffrage was conferred by the Federal Amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. O. F. Ellington,\r\npresident of the State Woman Suffrage Association, 1914-1917, and Mrs.\r\nT. T. Cotnam, State treasurer during these years and chairman of the\r\nState Suffrage Central Committee from 1917.\r\n\r\n[7] The following officers were elected: Chairman, Mrs. Ellington;\r\nsecretary, Mrs. Gibb, Little Rock. Finance Committee: Chairman, Mrs.\r\nCotnam; Mrs. C. C. Cate, Jonesboro; Mrs. Land, Mrs. William Ells,\r\nTexarkana; Mrs. W. H. Connell, Hot Springs. Committee that framed\r\nconstitution: Mrs. Fuller, Magazine; Mrs. Head, Mrs. Blaisdell, Hot\r\nSprings; Congressional chairman, Mrs. Ada Roussans, Jonesboro; Mrs.\r\nFitzhugh, Mrs. H. E. Morrow, Mrs. Head, Mrs. W. L. Moose, Mrs.\r\nDrennan, Mrs. Garland Street, district chairmen.\r\n\r\n[8] In June, 1912, Miss Kate Gordon offered a Primary bill as a\r\nsubstitute for the constitutional amendment in the Louisiana\r\nLegislature, but it never came out of committee. Miss Gordon said:\r\n\"The idea came to me as a solution of the woman suffrage question in a\r\nflash and it struck me as a good one. The Primary idea was mine as\r\nearly as 1912.\"\r\n\r\n[9] Most of the women whose names are mentioned in this chapter, with\r\nthe addition of Mrs. John P. Ahmand, Mrs. De Mott Henderson and Miss\r\nJennie De Neler, did valuable legislative work during this and other\r\nsessions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA.[10]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first ten years of the new century--Woman's Century--were years of\r\nlaborious effort in California to educate the public mind and\r\nfamiliarize it with the idea of \"votes for women.\" At the beginning of\r\nthe second decade the State had given them the complete suffrage and\r\nat its close the women of the entire nation were enfranchised by an\r\namendment to the Federal Constitution.\r\n\r\nA resubmission of the question in California could not be expected for\r\nseveral years after the defeat of a constitutional amendment in 1896,\r\nalthough no subsequent Legislature met without discussing the subject\r\nand voting on some phase of it. The liquor interests continued a\r\npersistent opposition but the suffrage association had a powerful ally\r\nin the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, with its franchise\r\ndepartment and its well organized army of workers, and, although\r\nsomewhat discouraged for a few years, held its annual convention and\r\nreorganization was gradually effected. The State convention of 1900\r\nmet December 14, 15, in Golden Gate Hall, San Francisco, with the\r\npresident, Mrs. Mary Wood Swift, in the chair. A resolution was\r\nadopted commending the former State president, Ellen Clark (Mrs. Aaron\r\nA.) Sargent, for instituting suit against the tax collector for the\r\nreturn of her taxes paid in San Francisco under written protest. [See\r\nVolume IV, page 504.] The members were urged to file a protest when\r\npaying taxes because they had no representation. It was declared that\r\nthe time was opportune for organized effort to have the Legislature\r\nagain submit an amendment to the voters. A vote of thanks was given\r\nto Miss Clara Schlingheyde for her success in obtaining donations for\r\nthe national suffrage bazaar in New York and appreciation expressed\r\nfor the generous response of California people, especially for the\r\ndonation of William Keith, the artist, of his picture, Spring in the\r\nNapa Valley. Mrs. Swift having served four years as president declined\r\nto hold the office longer and Mrs. Mary S. Sperry retired as treasurer\r\nafter serving seven years. The following board was elected: Honorary\r\npresidents, Mrs. Sargent of San Francisco and Mrs. Ellen Knox Goodrich\r\nof San Jose; president, Mrs. Annie R. Wood, Alameda; first, second and\r\nthird vice-presidents, Mrs. Lovell White, San Francisco, Mrs. E. O.\r\nSmith, San Jose, Mrs. Annie K. Bidwell, Chico; corresponding\r\nsecretary, Miss Carrie Whelan, Oakland; recording secretary, Mrs.\r\nDorothy Harnden; treasurer, Miss Schlingheyde, both of San Francisco;\r\nauditors, Mrs. A. K. Spero and Mrs. Keith.\r\n\r\nA visit in 1901 from Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, president of the\r\nNational American Suffrage Association, greatly encouraged the clubs.\r\nActing upon her urgent request, Mrs. Keith revived the Berkeley club,\r\nwhich soon doubled its membership and with the Oakland and Alameda\r\nclubs became a strong influence. There were three clubs in San\r\nFrancisco and an active organization in Santa Clara county, made up of\r\nSan Jose, Palo Alto and other clubs. Mrs. May Wright Sewall, president\r\nof the International Council of Women, came for an extended course of\r\nlectures in the interest of women's advancement. Women's organizations\r\nurged many changes in the unjust community property law, the W. C. T.\r\nU., the Women's Parliament of Southern California and the State\r\nSuffrage Association sending representatives to plead with the\r\nlegislators. A School suffrage bill passed the House and was defeated\r\nby only seven votes in the Senate and there was constant agitation.\r\nThe State convention this year was held at San Francisco in Yosemite\r\nHall, Native Sons' Building, October 18, 19, with a large number of\r\ndelegates and an interesting program. Executive board meetings had\r\nbeen held throughout the year and it was reported that eighty papers\r\nwere publishing suffrage matter sent them. Mrs. Leland Stanford in an\r\ninterview in the San Francisco _Examiner_ had declared herself in\r\nfavor of woman suffrage and a letter of appreciation was sent to her.\r\n\r\nThe annual convention met October 24, 25, 1902, in Century Hall, San\r\nFrancisco, with a large attendance and many excellent speakers, among\r\nthem Dr. David Starr Jordan, president of Stanford University, and B.\r\nFay Mills, the noted revivalist. Greetings were read from Miss Susan\r\nB. Anthony, Mrs. Harriet Taylor Upton, the national treasurer, and\r\nMrs. Caroline M. Severance, the loved pioneer, now in her 83rd year,\r\nwho had come from the East to Los Angeles over twenty years before.\r\nThe reports showed that the board had been in constant communication\r\nwith the national officers; an organizer, Mrs. Florence Stoddard, had\r\nbeen engaged; the treasury receipts were increasing; eighteen new\r\nclubs were recorded and there was general progress. Miss Vida\r\nGoldstein, a prominent suffrage leader of Australia, had been the\r\nguest of the association and a letter was sent to the Woman's Council\r\nof Australia, expressing gratitude for the assistance she had been in\r\nthe United States. Australia's recent enfranchisement of her 800,000\r\nwomen with eligibility to the national Parliament had given great\r\nencouragement to those of California. Mrs. Sperry was persuaded to\r\ntake the presidency.[11] An interesting event reported was a suffrage\r\nmeeting of the Sierra Club of mountain lovers one summer evening in\r\nKing's River Canyon, where it was encamped. In the audience of over\r\ntwo hundred prominent men and women were Professor Joseph Le Conte,\r\nJohn Muir, William Keith, Dr. C. Hart Merriam, head of the U. S.\r\nbiological department and Dr. Gannett, of the geological department.\r\n\r\nThe State convention of 1903 met in Golden Gate Hall, San Francisco,\r\nNovember 18, 19. Among the addresses of welcome was one by the Rev.\r\nBradford Leavitt of the Unitarian church and one by President Benham\r\nof the city Labor Council. Mrs. Sargent and Mrs. E. O. Smith paid\r\ntributes to the memory of the association's honorary president, Mrs.\r\nSarah Knox Goodrich, a devoted supporter of the cause for the past\r\nthirty-five years. Greetings were read from Miss Anthony, Henry B. and\r\nAlice Stone Blackwell, Mrs. Upton and Mrs. L. F. Darling, president of\r\nthe State Federation of Women's Clubs. Miss Gail Laughlin, a young\r\nlawyer from the East, who was now State organizer, was among the\r\nspeakers, and Albert H. Elliott, a San Francisco lawyer, gave an\r\ninstructive talk on California Laws for Women. The executive board\r\nmade the excellent appointment of Dr. Alida C. Avery of San Jose as\r\nhistorian. One hundred dollars were sent to the national board for use\r\nin the New Hampshire campaign. The State association endorsed Mrs.\r\nSargent's protest against a referendum vote on the issuing of San\r\nFrancisco's city bonds in which women were not allowed to take part.\r\n\r\nA question considered at many board meetings had been the advisability\r\nof trying to obtain from the Legislature another submission of an\r\namendment. The Los Angeles Suffrage League was waiting to know what\r\naction would be taken. Mrs. Catt had written that it might be well to\r\nmake the effort and so a resolution was unanimously adopted to ask\r\nthis of the session of 1905. A letter had been sent by Mrs. Catt\r\nsuggesting plans of work to this end for the coming year and one was\r\nreceived from Miss Anthony asking that Mrs. Stanton's birthday be\r\ncelebrated on November 12.\r\n\r\nThe Los Angeles Equal Suffrage Society had not affiliated with the\r\nState Association because of the long distance to San Francisco and\r\nthe announcement by Mrs. Sperry that the affiliation had now been made\r\nwas enthusiastically received. The movement had been active in\r\nSouthern California, where federations, parliaments and societies of\r\nmany kinds flourished, and the Woman Suffrage League had held monthly\r\nmeetings. Besides Mrs. Severance, another pioneer suffragist had come\r\nthere from the East many years ago, Mrs. Rebecca Spring, now past 90\r\nand still alert and interested. Mrs. Clara Shortridge Foltz, Mrs.\r\nAlice Moore McComas and Mrs. Almeda B. Grey were still among the\r\ncapable and valued workers.\r\n\r\nIn answer to an invitation from the Los Angeles city and county\r\nsuffrage leagues the State convention of 1904 was held in the Woman's\r\nClub House, October 6, 7, with three sessions daily. Articles of\r\nincorporation had been drawn by George C. Sargent of San Francisco and\r\nfiled with the Secretary of State, and the State organization had been\r\nincorporated under the name of the California Equal Suffrage\r\nAssociation. The convention was welcomed by Mrs. Ada J. Lingley and\r\nMrs. Mabel V. Osborne, county and city presidents. Mrs. Sperry in\r\nresponding expressed her great pleasure that Northern and Southern\r\nCalifornia would now work together for woman suffrage. The report of\r\nMiss Laughlin, State organizer, showed that fifty-two new clubs had\r\nbeen formed and that the membership had more than doubled in the past\r\nyear, and the treasurer, Miss Schlingheyde, told of $2,063 contributed\r\nfor organization work. Subscriptions to the amount of $1,110 were\r\nmade, Mrs. Keith leading with $500. Miss Amanda Way, an Indiana\r\npioneer, now of Whittier, made her offering. Mayor M. P. Snyder, Judge\r\nWaldo M. Yorke, the Rev. Eliza Tupper Wilkes and a long list of able\r\nspeakers addressed the evening meetings. Strong resolutions presented\r\nby the chairman of the committee, Mrs. Nellie Holbrook Blinn, were\r\nadopted. Mrs. Severance and Mrs. Spring were made honorary presidents.\r\n\r\nThe work for the coming months was to secure a large petition to the\r\nLegislature for the submission of a woman suffrage amendment and Mrs.\r\nOsborne was appointed chairman of the committee. Heading the 15,000\r\nnames which were eventually obtained were those of Governor George C.\r\nPardee, President David Starr Jordan, U. S. Senator George C. Perkins,\r\nW. S. Goodfellow, T. C. Coogan, Fred S. Stratton, A. A. Moore, George\r\nA. Knight, Henry J. Crocker, William H. Mills, Lovell White, M. B.\r\nWoodworth, Congressman James G. Maguire, Judge Carrol Cook and F. J.\r\nMurasky, all men of influence. The amendment was endorsed by the State\r\nassociation of 1,000 teachers. With the aid of the National\r\nAssociation 10,000 copies of Mrs. Catt's leaflet, Do You Know? were\r\ncirculated.\r\n\r\nThe suffrage leaders made a vigorous effort at Sacramento at the next\r\nlegislative session in 1905 but the measure was defeated in both\r\nHouses. California's full delegation of fourteen was in attendance at\r\nthe annual convention of the National American Suffrage Association in\r\nPortland, Ore., in June. On the way from Portland Miss Anthony, Dr.\r\nAnna Howard Shaw and several other eastern delegates stopped at Chico,\r\nthe home of Mrs. Bidwell, vice-president of the State association,\r\nwhere Miss Anthony spoke at the dedication of a magnificent park of\r\n2,200 acres which she was presenting to the town. They were royally\r\nentertained in California, beginning with a public reception at the\r\nSequoia Hotel in San Francisco. This was followed by others in\r\nOakland, East Oakland and Berkeley, attended by hundreds. A mass\r\nmeeting of 1,500 was arranged by the Equal Suffrage League in the\r\nAlhambra Theater, San Francisco.[12] Similar meetings and receptions\r\nawaited them in Southern California and they addressed an audience of\r\n10,000 at Venice, the noted seaside resort.\r\n\r\nThe State convention met in Wheeler's Auditorium, San Francisco, in\r\nOctober. Deep interest had been felt in the campaign for a woman\r\nsuffrage amendment carried on in Oregon during the summer and the\r\nassociation had wished to assist with money, organizers and speakers.\r\nFor this purpose the entire contents of the treasury, about $500, were\r\ncontributed and clubs and individuals sent more than that amount. Mrs.\r\nKeith gave $1,000 in the name of the State the following year.\r\n\r\nThe year 1906 opened auspiciously. In all parts of the State the clubs\r\nwere holding public meetings, supplying columns of suffrage matter to\r\nthe newspapers, now largely willing to publish them, and preparing for\r\na siege of the next Legislature. In April the city was almost\r\ndestroyed by fire and earthquake. One month afterwards the State board\r\nof officers met with a full quorum, ready to begin the effort to\r\nobtain woman suffrage planks in the platforms of the political parties\r\nat the approaching State conventions. This was accomplished in all but\r\nthat of the dominant Republican party. The work was continued\r\nthroughout the State of securing resolutions of endorsement from\r\nvarious kinds of organizations and by the end of the year these\r\nincluded a dozen State associations, and with societies other than\r\nsuffrage in the different cities the list filled two pages of a\r\nleaflet sent out from the headquarters. The annual convention was held\r\nin Calvary Presbyterian Church, San Francisco, October 5, 6, with an\r\nattractive program of men and women speakers. The initial number of\r\n_The Yellow Ribbon_, a monthly magazine edited by Mrs. Katharine Reed\r\nBalentine in the interest of woman suffrage on the Pacific coast, was\r\ndistributed among the delegates.\r\n\r\nThe State convention of 1907 met in October in the Ebell Club House of\r\nOakland, where excellent arrangements had been made by the various\r\ncommittees, and it was the most satisfactory yet held. There was a\r\nprogram of very good speakers, well-known men among them, and Mrs.\r\nMaud Wood Park of Boston was a guest of the convention. The chairman\r\nof the Press Committee, Mrs. Mabel Craft Deering, reported that 203\r\nnewspapers were using all the suffrage matter sent them. The chairman\r\nof the State Central Committee, Mrs. Lillian Harris Coffin, said that\r\nall the labor leaders were standing for woman suffrage. It was\r\nannounced that headquarters for pushing the submission of an amendment\r\nwould be established in Sacramento as soon as the Legislature opened\r\nin January. There was a resolution on the death of Mrs. Laura de Force\r\nGordon, the pioneer lawyer and suffragist. The work conference\r\nconducted by Mrs. Coffin was a valuable feature of the convention.\r\nOver 5,000 clubwomen outside of the suffrage clubs had now declared\r\nfor suffrage.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1908, Mrs. Maud Wood Park was invited to address the\r\nstudents of the State University in Berkeley at the Friday morning\r\nmeeting and Professor Morse Stephens said he never heard as able a\r\npresentation of any subject in so short a time. She organized branches\r\nof the National College Equal Suffrage League here and at Leland\r\nStanford University. All conventions during the year were asked\r\nthrough Mrs. Keith's committee to adopt woman suffrage resolutions and\r\nmany of them did so. Steps were taken through the State Central and\r\nLegislative Committees to interview candidates for the Legislature\r\nand pledge them after they were elected. The convention was held at\r\nthe California Club House, San Francisco, October 2, 3. The work\r\nconference was conducted by Mrs. Keith.\r\n\r\nIn 1909 strenuous work was done with the Legislature but it again\r\nrefused to submit the suffrage amendment, which it was the general\r\nopinion the voters would adopt if given an opportunity. The official\r\nboard sent a telegram to President Roosevelt asking him in the name of\r\n10,000 California women to recommend woman suffrage in his last\r\nmessage to Congress but without effect. Committees were appointed for\r\nNorthern and Southern California and a chairman in each county to\r\ncollect signatures to the petition of the National Association to\r\nCongress to submit a Federal Amendment. The State convention was held\r\nin Stockton September 30-October 2, one of the largest on record. It\r\nwas welcomed by the Mayor and the president of the chamber of commerce\r\nwith a response by Mrs. Sperry and there were greetings from a number\r\nof organizations of various kinds. The addresses were of a high order\r\nand among the speakers were Franklin Hichborn, J. N. Stuckenbruck,\r\nmember of the Legislature; Mrs. Sturtevant Peet, for sixteen years\r\npresident of the State W. C.T. U.; Thomas E. Hayden, president of the\r\nSan Francisco Board of Education; Mrs. Elinor Carlisle of the Berkeley\r\nboard and Mrs. James B. Hume, president of the State Federation of\r\nWomen's Clubs. Mrs. Sperry, who had filled the office of president for\r\nseven years, insisted upon retiring and Mrs. Elizabeth Lowe Watson, a\r\nminister, lecturer, writer and philanthropist, president of the Santa\r\nClara Club, was prevailed upon to accept the office. Mrs. Sperry, Mrs.\r\nSwift, Miss Sarah Severance and Dr. Jordan were added to the list of\r\nhonorary presidents. A full delegation had attended the national\r\nconvention at Seattle in July.\r\n\r\nAfter the earthquake and fire in 1906 headquarters had been\r\nestablished at 2419 California St., conveniently fitted up in part of\r\na dwelling house adjoining the residence of Mrs. Sargent, who presided\r\nand dispensed hospitality at the monthly board meetings. By 1910\r\nlarger and more central accommodations were needed and commodious\r\nheadquarters were secured in the Pacific Building, corner of Market\r\nand Fourth Streets. Here the increasing business of the association\r\nwas transacted and free lectures were given. Mrs. Alice Park, as\r\nchairman, superintended the wide distribution of literature throughout\r\nthe State. The association's committees on Child Labor, Education,\r\nPeace and other public questions were actively at work. The committee\r\non Petitions to the Legislature for the submission of a woman suffrage\r\namendment to the voters, of which Mrs. Sperry was chairman, secured\r\n14,000 signatures. Mrs. Lowe Watson said in her report to the national\r\nconvention that splendid work was being done in organization through\r\nthe generous financial aid of Mrs. Keith and Mrs. Charles D. Blaney.\r\nHouse to house canvasses were being made and assembly district and\r\nprecinct clubs formed. Mrs. Keith gave $100 a month during 1909 and\r\n1910 to this and other headquarters work, largely financed the\r\nlegislative work and frequently bore the principal expense of State\r\nconventions.[13] Space was freely granted in most of the newspapers\r\nand many were giving editorial endorsement. The College Women's Equal\r\nSuffrage Leagues were active and the subject of the universities'\r\nintercollegiate debate for the year was: Resolved that the ballot\r\nshould be extended to women. Men's Auxiliary Leagues were formed in\r\nNorthern and Southern California. A Votes for Women business club and\r\na Wage Earners' club were organized in San Francisco and did important\r\nwork. There were five downtown suffrage headquarters. Most of the\r\nwomen's clubs had introduced a civic section. Mrs. Lowe Watson\r\nlectured before labor unions, church societies, W. C. T. U.'s, \"native\r\ndaughters,\" women's clubs and suffrage clubs. The throng on\r\nSocialists' \"woman's day\" filled one of the largest halls in San\r\nFrancisco and at the close of her address gave a unanimous standing\r\nvote for equal suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe annual suffrage convention took place Sept. 30, Oct. 1, 1910, in\r\nthe Palace Hotel, San Francisco, the 40th that had been held in the\r\nState. The long program of prominent speakers, fraternal greetings,\r\ncommittee and club reports, showed the gathering weight and importance\r\nof the movement. J. Stitt Wilson, Mayor of Berkeley and Socialist\r\ncandidate for Governor, made a most encouraging address and J. H.\r\nBraly, an influential citizen of Pasadena, came to tell of what was\r\nbeing accomplished in Southern California. The visits of the national\r\nofficers, Professor Frances Squire Potter, Mrs. Florence Kelley and\r\nMrs. Ella S. Stewart had greatly inspired the workers and the\r\nfavorable action of the next Legislature seemed almost certain.\r\n\r\nFor the past year California had been in the midst of a crucial\r\npolitical campaign. The State government for forty years had been the\r\nservant of a powerful political \"machine\" controlled by large public\r\nservice corporations. The people had tired of it and public opinion\r\nwas ripe for a change. The \"progressive Republicans,\" as they were\r\ncalled, came into power at the election of November, 1910, and Hiram\r\nW. Johnson was elected Governor to carry out their reforms, woman\r\nsuffrage being one of them.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Committee was composed of Mrs. Coffin, Mrs. Blaney,\r\nMrs. Edson and Mrs. Arthur Cornwall Juilliard. Senator Charles W. Bell\r\nof Pasadena had continuously stood for woman suffrage in the face of\r\nthe opposition of the Senate and in the organization of the\r\nLegislature he was made chairman of the Republican caucus. Assemblyman\r\nA. H. Hewitt of Yuba City, also a staunch friend of years' standing,\r\ntook charge of the amendment in the House and when elected Speaker he\r\nplaced it in the hands of Assemblyman Cattell of Pasadena, who made it\r\nhis chief interest. The Anti-Suffrage organization of women for the\r\nfirst time maintained a lobby at the Capitol. The amendment was\r\nintroduced in both Houses the first week of the session. The Judiciary\r\nCommittee of the Senate granted a hearing on the evening of Jan. 18,\r\n1911. The crowd was so large it had to be held in the Senate chamber,\r\nand gallery, aisles and lobby were filled. Mrs. Katharine Philips\r\nEdson of Los Angeles introduced the speakers and Mrs. Elizabeth\r\nGerberding of San Francisco made the opening argument. Miss Maude\r\nYounger spoke in behalf of the working women; Miss Ethel Moore and\r\nMrs. Cornelia McKinne Stanwood of the College Equal Suffrage League\r\nrepresented the children and the women of the State; Mrs. Coffin,\r\nspeaking for the State Suffrage Association, urged the legislators to\r\nstand by the suffrage plank in their party platforms. Mrs. Shelley\r\nTolhurst closed the appeal. Then Mrs. George A. Caswell of Los\r\nAngeles, representing the women anti-suffragists, read a paper of\r\nfifty minutes.\r\n\r\nPossibly there was no measure before the Legislature in which deeper\r\ninterest was manifested or which had the urge of stronger public\r\nsentiment. Lieutenant Governor A. J. Wallace of Los Angeles was a true\r\nfriend and Senator A. E. Boynton of Marysville, president pro tem.,\r\nhad for years loyally supported it. The Los Angeles delegation with\r\nbut few exceptions were pledged in favor. Many opponents of years'\r\nstanding, feeling the pressure of popularity, were prepared to\r\ncapitulate. Senator J. B. Sanford of Ukiah, who had long been a thorn\r\nin the flesh of the suffrage lobby, attempted to block it but was\r\nprevented by Senator Louis Juilliard and a spirited debate was led by\r\nSenator Lee C. Gates of Los Angeles, a leader of progressive measures.\r\nOn January 26 the amendment came up for third reading and final\r\npassage. There was no need of further debate but each Senator seemed\r\ndesirous of paying his tribute. It received 35 ayes and the opposition\r\ncould muster only five votes. The Senate resolution was submitted in\r\nthe Assembly and voted on February 2. Gallery and lobbies were\r\nthronged and only time limited the oratory. It received 66 ayes, 12\r\nnoes. Governor Johnson had insisted on the submission of the amendment\r\nas a party pledge.\r\n\r\nPink roses were sent by the committee to Mrs. Johnson, wife of the\r\nGovernor, and violets to Mrs. Wallace for their helpful cooperation.\r\nCordial appreciation was expressed to the wives of Senators and\r\nAssemblymen who did yeoman service, among them Mrs. Bell, Mrs. Gates,\r\nMrs. Henry Ward Beecher Brown, Mrs. Miguel Estidillo and Mrs. Cattell.\r\n\r\nAfter the adjournment of the Legislature a conference was called by\r\nthe Progressive leaders to outline the plan of campaign for the many\r\namendments which had been submitted and it was decided _not to mention\r\nthe suffrage amendment_, as much needed contributions had been made on\r\nthis condition lest it might cause some of the others to be defeated.\r\nThere was strenuous objection to this plan by some of its friends but\r\nthe majority prevailed. Governor Johnson was present at the meeting\r\nand carried out its program during the entire campaign, not referring\r\nto the suffrage amendment in his speeches. It was said that he\r\nexpected it to lose and did not want to jeopardize the amendments\r\nwhich would enable the voters to take the law-making power into their\r\nown hands and secure all desired reforms. A notable exception among\r\nthe official speakers was Francis J. Heney, who never failed to\r\ninclude it with the others in his appeals to the voters.\r\n\r\nThe general political situation in California at the time, however,\r\nfavored the suffrage campaign. The five parties had put a woman\r\nsuffrage plank in their platforms and the voters could concentrate\r\ntheir attention on the twenty-three proposed constitutional\r\namendments, for which a special election was called October 10. There\r\nwere but eight months for what would have to be a \"whirlwind\r\ncampaign.\" The president of the State association, Mrs. Lowe Watson,\r\nsaid in her report to the next national suffrage convention:\r\n\r\n     The situation was very different from that of 1895-96. Not only\r\n     were the suffragists better organized but as a result of the\r\n     previous campaign, in which the National Association largely\r\n     participated, there were earnest suffragists in every kind of\r\n     association in the State, in the Federated Women's Clubs; the W.\r\n     C. T. U., with a franchise department in every local; the\r\n     Socialist party, the State Grange and the ever-growing Labor\r\n     Unions. We determined to make a strenuous effort to get into\r\n     touch with every progressive element. Our State Campaign\r\n     Committee, with headquarters in San Francisco, consisted of\r\n     chairmen of the ten departments of work.... In addition we had an\r\n     Advisory Council composed of picked men and women over the State.\r\n     During the two preceding years the State association had been\r\n     carrying forward organization work under the able supervision of\r\n     Mrs. Helen Moore as chairman but there still remained much to be\r\n     done. Our territory was large, a portion of it immensely\r\n     difficult. It was conceded that a house to house canvass was of\r\n     the utmost importance, particularly in the large cities.\r\n\r\n     The suffragists of Southern California, whose work with the\r\n     Legislature had been of incalculable value, led by J. H. Braly,\r\n     president of the Los Angeles Political Equality League, assumed\r\n     the responsibility of caring for the ten counties south of the\r\n     Tehachapi Pass and nobly did they fulfil all expectations. We\r\n     realized that the great \"interests\" were arrayed against us.\r\n     Untold money was at the command of our enemies and they were\r\n     schooled in political methods. We had little money and less\r\n     political experience but we had consecration of purpose and we\r\n     gave ourselves to the work, North and South, with unbounded\r\n     enthusiasm....\r\n\r\n     There was scarcely a corner of the State unvisited by good\r\n     speakers. Under the supervision of Mrs. Rose M. French, the State\r\n     association issued 3,000,000 pages of literature, while the\r\n     College Women's Equal Suffrage League and other organizations in\r\n     the North, and the Political Equality League of Los Angeles, also\r\n     published countless thousands of leaflets, besides ordering many\r\n     from the National Association. Under the tactful management of\r\n     Mrs. Ringrose, 50,000 Catholic leaflets were distributed at the\r\n     doors of Catholic churches. The picture slides and stereopticon\r\n     talks, superintended by Mrs. Lucretia Watson Taylor, were very\r\n     effective, particularly in the outlying districts. Posters,\r\n     pennants and banners played a conspicuous part in the campaign.\r\n     The attendance at the meetings held in theaters, churches, halls\r\n     and on the street corners was surprisingly large and in many\r\n     instances splendidly enthusiastic. The attitude of the public\r\n     generally was respectful and often profoundly sympathetic. Our\r\n     country clubs and county organizations followed closely the plans\r\n     recommended by the State association. It was purely an\r\n     educational campaign, without one shadow of partisanship or\r\n     militant methods. The victory in the State of Washington in 1910\r\n     and the manner in which the enfranchised women used their newly\r\n     acquired power contributed much to the success in California. The\r\n     pulpit and the press were also largely with us. We worked hard to\r\n     make sure of these two great instrumentalities for the education\r\n     of the people.\r\n\r\n     Our inland co-workers largely financed their own special lines of\r\n     propaganda. The generous contributions of the National\r\n     Association and the smaller personal donations through that body,\r\n     amounting altogether to about $1,800, and the noble work of the\r\n     national vice-president, Mrs. Catharine Waugh McCulloch, were a\r\n     large factor in our success. The Woman Suffrage Party of New York\r\n     sent us able speakers. Among our many good fortunes was the\r\n     coming of the National Education Association convention to San\r\n     Francisco. Miss Gail Laughlin was of immense service as a speaker\r\n     and as chairman of the Election Committee....\r\n\r\n     The State association disbursed about $10,000, not counting the\r\n     expenses in Southern California. Mrs. Keith contributed $3,000\r\n     within the year; Mrs. Anna K. Bidwell $1,000 through the State\r\n     treasury, besides assisting her own county organization. Mrs.\r\n     Charles D. Blaney gave generous sums, while others in an equally\r\n     liberal spirit donated from $200 down to one, according to their\r\n     means; and others again, having no gold or precious stones, gave\r\n     what was best of all, themselves, nobly, untiringly, out of their\r\n     love for justice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo active work in suffrage was done in Southern California for some\r\nyears after the defeat of 1896. In November, 1900, the State\r\npresident, Mrs. Mary Wood Swift, went to Los Angeles, a parlor meeting\r\nwas held and later a public address was given by her at the Woman's\r\nClub House. Here it was determined to revive the Woman Suffrage League\r\nand an executive committee was appointed, Mrs. Sarah Burger Stearns,\r\na veteran suffragist, formerly of Minnesota, chairman. On December 1 a\r\nmeeting was called by this committee and the league was re-organized;\r\nPresident, Mrs. Caroline M. Severance; vice-president, Mrs. Shelley\r\nTolhurst; secretary, Mrs. Lenore C. Schultz. Monthly meetings were\r\nheld for several years at the Woman's Club House, the money for the\r\nrent being given by Mr. Wilde, whose sympathy was strong for suffrage.\r\nThe years from 1900 to 1910-11 were just years of \"carrying on\" and\r\nwell the pioneers did their work.[14] They kept the fires burning and\r\ngradually all kinds of organizations of women became permeated with a\r\nbelief in suffrage for women and were ready for the final campaign.\r\n\r\nThe work of John Hyde Braly in Southern California deserves a place by\r\nitself. A prosperous business man and public-spirited citizen, when\r\nthe call came to assist the movement to enfranchise the women of the\r\nState he saw the necessity of interesting men of prominence. From\r\nearly in January, 1910, he worked to secure the enrollment of one\r\nhundred names of the leading citizens of Los Angeles and Pasadena.\r\nFinally he arranged a mid-day banquet on the fifth of April and about\r\nfifty responded. Organization was perfected with a charter membership\r\nof one hundred influential men under the name of the Political\r\nEquality League of California and the following compact was signed:\r\n\"We hereby associate ourselves together for the purpose of securing\r\npolitical equality and suffrage without distinction on account of\r\nsex.\" The officers elected were: J. H. Braly, president; Judge Waldo\r\nM. Yorke, first vice-president; Hulett Merritt, second; J. D.\r\nBradford, secretary and treasurer. Enthusiastic speeches were made and\r\nMr. Braly said that they were initiating this movement at the\r\npsychological time, for the progressive fever was in the California\r\nblood. It was a man's job to take a hand in the enfranchisement of\r\nwomen, since it was the men who must decide it by their votes. The\r\nleague was pledged to work to induce the legislators to submit the\r\namendment to the voters. Nine men were organized in a Board of\r\nGovernors and it was decided to have women become associate members\r\nof the organization, they to select nine women to be governors with\r\nthe men. The movement was thus popularized and desirable men and women\r\nof all classes rapidly joined it.\r\n\r\nHeadquarters were established in the Story Building and systematic\r\nwork begun. Judge Yorke was chairman of the legislative and political\r\ndepartment. The 850 delegates and the audience at the Los Angeles\r\nCounty Republican convention in Simpson Auditorium in August were\r\nenthusiastically for woman suffrage. Eighty-three delegates went from\r\nthat convention to the State Republican convention of 430 delegates in\r\nSan Francisco. Mr. Braly was not only one of these delegates but also\r\na member of the platform committee. The suffrage plank went into the\r\nplatform and was received with the same enthusiasm apparently as in\r\nLos Angeles. After a progressive Legislature was elected in the fall\r\nof 1910 the Political Equality League gave a banquet at the Alexandria\r\nHotel in honor of the southern legislators, the State officers-elect\r\nand their wives, with nearly 600 present. Mr. Braly said of this\r\noccasion: \"We all felt that we were making history and casting bread\r\nupon the waters that would surely return to us in a day of need,\r\nwhich, thank God, it did, for without it I think the suffrage bill\r\nwould not have been passed.\"\r\n\r\nThe organization's express purpose was to use all legitimate means to\r\ninfluence the Legislature to submit the amendment and every legislator\r\nof the nine southern counties went to Sacramento pledged to vote for\r\nit. After the Legislature had submitted the amendment the Political\r\nEquality League held its annual election. It was felt that it would be\r\nunjust to ask Mr. Braly to have charge of the details of the strenuous\r\ncampaign and with expressions of the highest appreciation he was made\r\npresident emeritus and Mrs. Seward A. Simons, president. Mr. Braly\r\narranged to have Mrs. McCulloch of Chicago make a speaking tour of\r\nSouthern California in company with a party consisting of himself and\r\nwife, Judge Neely, Judge W. S. Harbert and Senator Lee C. Gates, at\r\nhis own expense, as was all of his work. Mrs. Edson wrote to him after\r\nthe campaign: \"Without the platform pledges of the Republican county\r\nand State conventions we could never have held the legislators and to\r\nyou the women of California are indebted for making this possible.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Simons in her comprehensive report said in part:\r\n\r\n     In the southern part of the State the work from the beginning was\r\n     undertaken with the understanding that everything possible should\r\n     be done to counteract the effect of the probable San Francisco\r\n     vote and the California Political Equality League concentrated\r\n     its attention on Los Angeles and the country districts throughout\r\n     the State. The Executive Board, composed of the following\r\n     members, Mrs. Simons, president; Mrs. Tolhurst, chairman of the\r\n     Speakers' Committee; Mrs. Berthold Baruch, of the Meetings\r\n     Committee; Miss Louise Carr, Literature; Mrs. Edson,\r\n     Organization; Mrs. Martha Nelson McCan, Press; Mrs. John R.\r\n     Haynes, Finance; Miss Annie Bock, secretary, concerned itself\r\n     with effective publicity work--public meetings, the distribution\r\n     of literature and the press....\r\n\r\n     Leaflets and pamphlets that appealed to every type of mind were\r\n     printed to the amount of over a million.... Votes-for-Women\r\n     buttons to the number of 93,000 and 13,000 pennants and banners\r\n     added their quota to the publicity work.... One of the most\r\n     effective means of publicity was that of letters of a personal\r\n     nature addressed to members of the various professions and\r\n     vocations. A letter was sent to 2,000 ministers asking their\r\n     cooperation; 60,000 letters were sent through the country\r\n     districts. Leaflets in Italian, German and French were given out\r\n     at the street meetings in the congested districts of Los Angeles.\r\n     A circular letter was sent in September to every club and\r\n     organization asking that they give an evening before the election\r\n     to a suffrage speaker to be supplied by the league. Suffrage was\r\n     presented to every class from the men's clubs in the churches to\r\n     the unions' meetings in the Labor Temple.\r\n\r\n     The importance of getting the endorsement of large bodies of\r\n     women was recognized. A few of these endorsing were the Woman's\r\n     Parliament of 2,000 members; State Federation of Women's Clubs,\r\n     35,000; Federated College Clubs, 5,000; State Nurses'\r\n     Association, 800; State W. C. T. U., 6,000; Woman's Organized\r\n     Labor, 36,000, and the Los Angeles Teachers' Club, 800. All of\r\n     these endorsements were secured at conventions held in Southern\r\n     California and the Northern women pursued the same policy. These\r\n     do not include those made by organizations of men, or of men and\r\n     women or of clubs for suffrage alone and these in the South\r\n     exceeded fifty. In a large measure success was due to the\r\n     inestimable assistance given by the eminent speakers, among them\r\n     supreme court judges, prominent lawyers, physicians, ministers,\r\n     noted educators and philanthropists and by men and women from all\r\n     callings and occupations....\r\n\r\n     During the last two months meetings were arranged in all the\r\n     towns of the southern counties where it was possible. When a hall\r\n     could not be had they were held in the open air. The last month\r\n     from fifty to sixty meetings a week were planned from the league\r\n     headquarters, speakers supplied and literature sent. These did\r\n     not include those arranged by local organizations in smaller\r\n     towns nor the many street meetings which were held by every one\r\n     who could command an automobile. The climax was in the largest\r\n     theater in Los Angeles on the evening of September 30 when over\r\n     4,000 people listened to the best speakers of the campaign. In\r\n     addition another thousand gathered in Choral Hall for an overflow\r\n     meeting, while many hundreds were turned from the doors. It was\r\n     the largest political demonstration in the history of Southern\r\n     California.\r\n\r\n     The most important phase of the publicity work was that of the\r\n     Press Committee, formed of active newspaper women. Miss Bess Munn\r\n     was made secretary and her time was devoted exclusively to\r\n     supplying material to the local press and the country newspapers.\r\n     Double postals asking individuals their opinion of the suffrage\r\n     movement were sent to the members of the Legislature; to city,\r\n     county and State officials from San Diego to Siskiyou; to judges,\r\n     lawyers, merchants, bankers, physicians and all prominent\r\n     visitors within the gates of the city. Their answers were from\r\n     time to time printed in the form of interviews. Letters went to\r\n     club women in every town asking for cooperation in securing space\r\n     for suffrage material in the local press. Personal letters were\r\n     sent to all the editors informing them that a weekly suffrage\r\n     letter would be sent to them from the headquarters of the league.\r\n     This contained nothing but the shortest, pithiest items of\r\n     suffrage activities and enclosed were the leaflets which were\r\n     often printed in full. At the close of the campaign more than\r\n     half of the papers of the State regularly used the letter either\r\n     as news or as a basis for editorial comment. In Los Angeles alone\r\n     more than 10,000 columns were printed on suffrage. In monetary\r\n     value this amount of space would have cost $100,000. The last\r\n     week before election a cut of the ballot showing the position of\r\n     the suffrage amendment was sent to 150 newspapers of the South\r\n     with a letter offering the editor $5 for its publication but many\r\n     printed it without compensation....\r\n\r\n     The majorities from the country districts won the victory by\r\n     counteracting the immense majority rolled up against the\r\n     amendment in San Francisco and thus proved that the country\r\n     residents are most satisfactorily reached by the country press.\r\n\r\nThe anti-suffragists made a more open fight in California than ever\r\nbefore. A month preceding election a Committee of Fifty was organized\r\nin Los Angeles composed of the reactionary elements, men representing\r\n\"big business,\" corporation lawyers, a number connected with the\r\nSouthern Pacific R.R., some socially prominent. The only one known\r\nnationally was former U. S. Senator Frank P. Flint. The president was\r\na Southerner, George S. Patten, who wrote long articles using the\r\narguments and objections employed in the very earliest days of the\r\nsuffrage movement sixty years ago. They claimed to have thousands of\r\nmembers but never held a meeting and depended on intimidation by their\r\nrather formidable list of names of local influence.\r\n\r\nThe Women's Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage was more active. It\r\nwas formed in Los Angeles, with Mrs. George A. Caswell, head of a\r\nfashionable school for girls, as its president. It organized also in\r\nNorthern California with Mrs. C. L. Goddard president and Mrs.\r\nBenjamin Ide Wheeler heading the list of honorary presidents. Both\r\nbranches had a long list of officers, some with social prestige, and\r\nmaintained headquarters. They also claimed to have a large membership\r\nbut held only parlor and club meetings. The National Anti-Suffrage\r\nAssociation sent its secretary, Miss Minnie Bronson, to speak, write,\r\norganize and have charge of headquarters. Mrs. William Force Scott\r\ncame as a speaker from New York. The association was not an important\r\nfactor in the campaign.\r\n\r\nTheodore Roosevelt lectured in California in the spring of 1911. He\r\nhad been in the State twice in preceding years and each time had\r\nreferred disparagingly to woman suffrage. During the present visit he\r\nspoke in the Greek Theater at the State University in Berkeley to an\r\naudience of 10,000 on March 25 and the San Francisco _Examiner_ of the\r\nnext morning said in its report:\r\n\r\n     Here is what Colonel Roosevelt said on the burning question of\r\n     woman suffrage:\r\n\r\n     \"A short time ago I was handed a letter from the president of an\r\n     Equal Suffrage Association asking me to speak in behalf of it. I\r\n     have always told my friends that it seemed to me that no man was\r\n     worth his salt who didn't think deeply of woman's rights and no\r\n     woman was worth her salt who didn't think more of her duties than\r\n     of her rights. Personally I am tepidly in favor of woman\r\n     suffrage. I have studied the condition of women in those States\r\n     where that right is exercised but I have never been able to take\r\n     a great interest in it because it always seemed to me so much\r\n     less important than so many other questions affecting women. I\r\n     don't think the harm will come of it that its opponents expect,\r\n     and I don't think that one-half of one per cent. of the good will\r\n     come from it that its friends expect. It is not a millionth part\r\n     as important as keeping and reviving the realization that the\r\n     great work of women must be done in the home. The ideal woman of\r\n     the future as of the past is the good wife and mother, able to\r\n     train numbers of healthy children.\"\r\n\r\nThere were flourishing suffrage societies in all parts of the State.\r\nAn Equal Suffrage League had been formed in San Francisco from a\r\nconsolidation of suffrage clubs, with a large membership of men and\r\nwomen, Mrs. Mary T. Gamage, president. With its various committees it\r\nwas an active force throughout the campaign. Great assistance was\r\nrendered by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, as had been the\r\ncase in 1896. During the fifteen years' interval it had been carrying\r\non a steady work of education through its local unions and their\r\nmembers were among the most active in the suffrage clubs also. So\r\ncomplete was the cooperation that they took off their white ribbon\r\nbadges toward the end of the campaign to disarm prejudice. Mrs. Keith,\r\npresident of the Berkeley Club, hired a house in the central part of\r\ntown for eight months as headquarters and Mrs. Hester Harland was\r\ninstalled as manager. An advisory committee was formed of Mrs. George\r\nW. Haight, Mrs. John Snook, Mrs. Fred G. Athearn, Mrs. Irving M.\r\nScott, Jr., Dr. Helen Waterman, Mrs. Samuel C. Haight, Mrs. Aaron\r\nSchloss, Mrs. T. B. Sears, Mrs. C. C. Hall, Mrs. Frank F. Bunker,\r\nassisted by many others toward the close of the campaign. Mrs. J. B.\r\nHume and Miss Blanche Morse toured the State as speakers and\r\norganizers. Mrs. Keith herself spoke on a number of special occasions.\r\nMrs. Watson spoke night and day for three weeks in Sacramento Valley;\r\nat Chico to an audience of 3,000.[15]\r\n\r\nThe Central Campaign Committee was created in July, three months\r\nbefore election, consisting of one member from each of the five\r\nprincipal campaign organizations in San Francisco doing State work.\r\nMrs. Watson Taylor, daughter of the president, represented the State\r\nEqual Suffrage Association; Mrs. Aylett Cotton, the Clubwoman's\r\nFranchise League; Mrs. Robert A. Dean, the Woman Suffrage Party; Miss\r\nMaud Younger, the Wage Earners' League and Mrs. Deering the College\r\nLeague. This committee was formed at the suggestion of Mrs. James\r\nLees Laidlaw of New York, who visited San Francisco with her husband\r\nin January, for the purpose of having all the organizations share in\r\nthe money and workers sent by the New York Woman Suffrage Party. Over\r\n$1,000 were received from it, of which $500 came from General Horace\r\nCarpentier, a former Californian and ex-mayor of Oakland, sent through\r\nMr. Laidlaw. The Men's New York League sent $200; the Rochester\r\nPolitical Equality Club, $280; Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt $300. New York\r\nsuffragists also paid the railroad expenses of the three organizers\r\nand speakers whom they sent and Chicago suffragists paid the\r\ntravelling expenses of Mrs. McCulloch, who contributed her services.\r\n\r\nFrom outside States came Miss Helen Todd, former factory inspector of\r\nIllinois; Miss Margaret Haley of Chicago; Miss Jeannette Rankin of\r\nMontana; Mrs. Helen Hoy Greeley, Mrs. A. C. Fisk and Mrs. John Rogers\r\nof New York; Mrs. Mary Stanislawsky of Nevada; Mrs. Alma Lafferty,\r\nmember of the Colorado Legislature. These speakers were sent\r\nthroughout Northern California.\r\n\r\nThe chairman of the Press Committee, Mrs. Deering, had been carrying\r\non the press work steadily for the past five years and hundreds of\r\npapers were ready to support the amendment. Before the end of the\r\nbrief campaign, under her efficient management, almost every paper of\r\nprominence either endorsed it or remained silent. The Los Angeles\r\n_Express_, Sacramento _Bee_, _Star_ and _Union_, the San Jose\r\n_Mercury_, the Oakland _Enquirer_, the San Francisco _Bulletin_ and\r\nthe _Daily News_ were especially helpful. James H. Barry, editor of\r\nthe _Star_, was an unfailing advocate. The _Call_ made a sustained\r\nfight for it and the _Examiner_ and _Post_ advised a vote in favor.\r\nThe German papers were outspokenly opposed. The _Chronicle_ in San\r\nFrancisco, owned by M. H. De Young, and the _Times_, in Los Angeles,\r\nby Harrison Grey Otis, were relentless opponents. Much assistance was\r\nrendered in the Legislature and the campaign by E. A. Dickson, a\r\nprominent journalist of Los Angeles. The women connected with the\r\npress were sympathetic and helpful.\r\n\r\nA most important feature of this remarkable campaign was the work of\r\nthe College Equal Suffrage League of Northern California, which had\r\nbeen organized in 1909 for educational work among college women. When\r\nthe suffrage amendment was submitted in February, 1911, the league\r\ndecided to go actively into the campaign. The officers elected in May\r\nwere as follows: Miss Charlotte Anita Whitney (Wellesley), president;\r\nDr. Adelaide Brown (Smith), first vice-president; Miss Caroline Cook\r\nJackson (Cornell), second; Miss Lillien J. Martin (Vassar), third;\r\nMiss Belle Judith Miller (California), recording secretary; Miss\r\nGenevieve Cook (California Woman's Hospital), corresponding secretary;\r\nMrs. Genevieve Allen (Stanford), executive secretary; Dr. Anna Rude\r\n(Cooper Medical College), treasurer; Dr. Rachel L. Ash (California),\r\ndelegate to Council. Directors: Miss Ethel Moore (Vassar); Mrs. Mabel\r\nCraft Deering (California); Miss Kate Ames (Stanford); Mrs. Carlotta\r\nCase Hall (Elmira); Miss Frances W. McLean (California); Mrs. Thomas\r\nHaven (California); Dr. Kate Brousseau (University of Paris); Mrs. C.\r\nH. Howard (California).[16]\r\n\r\nAltogether $2,075 were sent to the league from the East. Its total\r\nreceipts were $11,030 in fixed sums and the personal donations of its\r\nworking members in telegrams, postage, car fare, expressage, use of\r\nautomobiles, etc., amounted to thousands. At a meeting held in Oakland\r\nMiss Sylvia Pankhurst spoke to more than a thousand persons who had\r\npaid for their seats.\r\n\r\nEvery legitimate method of campaigning was used, beginning with the\r\nprinting of 900,000 leaflets. There were posters and all kinds of\r\ndesigns; city circularizing of the most thorough kind in many\r\nlanguages; pageants, plays, concerts and public social functions; the\r\nplacarding of city bill boards over miles of country; advertising of\r\nevery possible kind; huge electric and other signs; long weeks of\r\nautomobile campaigning in the country and the villages; special\r\nspeakers for all sorts of organizations; a handsome float in the labor\r\nday parade; speaking at vaudeville shows--there was no cessation of\r\nthese eight months' strenuous work. The campaigning in Sacramento was\r\nin charge of Mrs. Mary Roberts Coolidge, assisted by Mrs. E. V.\r\nSpencer, against great odds, but the city gave a small favorable\r\nmajority, due chiefly to the union labor vote.\r\n\r\nDuring the last six months the College League held more than fifty\r\npublic meetings in halls in San Francisco, the audiences at the larger\r\nones varying from 1,300 to 10,000 with hundreds turned away. The Rev.\r\nCharles F. Aked, the brilliant English orator, had just come from New\r\nYork and he made his first appearance outside of his pulpit at a\r\nsuffrage mass meeting in Savoy Theater, donated by the John Cort\r\nmanagement, and afterwards he could not refuse to speak at other\r\nmeetings. His debate with Colonel John P. Irish in the Valencia\r\nTheater just before election was one of the great features of the\r\ncampaign. One of the most important meetings, with 1,500 present, was\r\naddressed by the eloquent young priest, the Rev. Joseph M. Gleason,\r\nwith the boxes reserved for prominent Catholics. Rabbi Martin H. Meyer\r\nwas one of the strong speakers. At the meeting in the beautiful new\r\nauditorium of Scottish Rite Hall Mrs. Alexander Morrison, president of\r\nthe National Collegiate Alumnae, was in the chair and among the\r\nspeakers were Dr. Aked, William C. Ralston, U. S. Sub-Treasurer; Mrs.\r\nW. W. Douglas and Albert H. Elliott. In the Italian theater was held\r\nthe largest meeting of a political nature known to that quarter,\r\naddressed by Emilio Lastredo, a prominent banking attorney; Ettore\r\nPatrizi, editor of the daily _L'Italia_; Mr. Elliott, Miss Margaret\r\nHaley and Mayor J. Stitt Wilson of Berkeley. A second great suffrage\r\nmeeting assembled there again, at which Mme. Adelina Dosenna of La\r\nScala, Milan, sang. The culmination was the mass meeting in Dreamland\r\nRink, the largest auditorium in the city. Mrs. Lowe Watson, president\r\nof the State association, introduced by George A. Knight, was in the\r\nchair. There were 6,000 in the audience and 4,000 on the outside, whom\r\nMrs. Greeley and other speakers kept in a good humor. These were Mrs.\r\nMcCulloch, Dr. Aked, John I. Nolan, union labor leader; Mr. Wilson,\r\nMiss Todd, Miss Laughlin and Rabbi Meyer.\r\n\r\nThe campaign closed with a \"business men's meeting\" in Cort's Theater\r\nfrom 12 to 1:30 p. m. the day before election. The theater was crowded\r\nand it was necessary to begin before noon. For several hours the\r\nspeakers held forth to an audience changing every half hour. Mr.\r\nElliott presided and the speakers were F. G. Athearn of the Southern\r\nPacific R. R.; Dr. Aked, Mr. Wilson, R. C. Van Fleet, Miss Todd and A.\r\nL. Sapiro. Then came the climax to the campaign when Mrs. Ernestine\r\nBlack stepped forward and announced that Mme. Lilian Nordica would\r\nspeak for woman suffrage and sing in Union Square that evening!\r\n\r\nThe great prima donna had come to San Francisco to sing at the\r\nground-breaking for the Panama Exposition and in an ever-generous\r\nspirit agreed to give her matchless services to the cause in which she\r\nwas deeply interested. The crowds were packed for blocks in every\r\ndirection and suffrage speakers were addressing them from automobiles\r\nwhen Madame Nordica stood up in masses of flowers in Union Square\r\nopposite the St. Francis Hotel and very simply made her plea for the\r\nenfranchisement of California women. Then her glorious voice rang out\r\nto the very edges of the throng in the stirring notes of the Star\r\nSpangled Banner. The campaign was over.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe amendment went to the voters Oct. 10, 1911. It was most important\r\nto watch the vote in San Francisco and Oakland, as their expected\r\nadverse vote would have to be counteracted by the rest of the State if\r\nthe suffrage amendment carried. Oakland was put in charge of Mrs.\r\nCoolidge, who had a corps of efficient helpers in the members of the\r\nAmendment League, composed of old residents of Oakland, who had been\r\nengaged for many years in church, temperance and other social work,\r\namong them Mrs. Sarah C. Borland, Mrs. Agnes Ray, Mrs. A. A. Dennison,\r\nMrs. Emma Shirtzer, Mrs. Jean Kellogg, Mrs. F. M. Murray and Mrs. F.\r\nHarlan. Of these league members 240 stood at the polls twelve hours,\r\nnot half enough of them but they were treated with the greatest\r\nrespect and undoubtedly they helped reduce the adverse majority. This\r\nwork was paralleled in Berkeley, Alameda and other places around the\r\nbay.\r\n\r\nFour weeks before election two representatives of each of the nine\r\nsuffrage associations of San Francisco met and placed in the capable\r\nhands of Miss Laughlin the difficult task of looking after the\r\nelection in that city and this committee of eighteen acted as an\r\nexecutive board for carrying out her plans. Her management received\r\nthe highest commendation from political leaders. Dr. Mary Sperry and\r\nMisses Miriam and Julie Michelson were a permanent office force and\r\nMiss Schlingheyde, Mrs. Chapin and Miss Sullivan carried much of the\r\nwork. The Woman Suffrage Party gave the use of its headquarters in the\r\nLick building. The State association and the clubs of San Francisco\r\ncontributed about $1,500. A captain was appointed for each district\r\nwho selected her precinct captains and was supplied with an\r\nautomobile. Connection was established with the chairmen throughout\r\nthe counties and all were charged to \"watch the count.\" On election\r\nday and the next day $94 were spent for telegrams. To nearby places\r\nexperienced workers were rushed when the word came of dishonest\r\nelection officials. There were 1,066 volunteer workers in San\r\nFrancisco, 118 of them men. On election day hundreds reported for duty\r\nbefore 6 o'clock and after standing at the polls twelve hours many\r\nwent into the booths and kept tally of the count until midnight. In\r\nOakland Pinkerton men were hired to watch it and in San Francisco the\r\nvault where the ballots were deposited was watched for two days and\r\nnights.\r\n\r\nThe vote in San Francisco was 21,912 ayes, 35,471 noes, an adverse\r\nmajority of 13,559, and even the imperfect watching of the women\r\ndetected a fraudulent count of 3,000. In Oakland there were 6,075\r\nayes, 7,818 noes, an adverse majority of 1,743. Berkeley alone of the\r\nplaces around the bay came in victorious with 2,417 ayes, 1,761 noes,\r\na favorable majority of 656. Los Angeles, which in 1896 had given a\r\nmajority of about 4,600 in favor, returned 15,708 ayes, 13,921 noes, a\r\nmajority of only 1,787. On election night and for two days following\r\nthe suffragists judged from the vote in the cities that they were\r\ndefeated but the favorable returns from the villages, the country\r\ndistricts and the ranches came slowly in and when the count was\r\nfinally completed it was found that out of a total of 246,487 votes\r\nthe suffrage amendment had been carried by 3,587, an average majority\r\nof one in every voting precinct in the State.[17]\r\n\r\nWith the winning of this old, wealthy and influential State the entire\r\nmovement for woman suffrage passed the crisis and victory in the\r\nremaining western States was sure to be a matter of a comparatively\r\nshort time. As soon as the result was certain Mrs. Watson, the State\r\npresident; Mrs. Sperry and Miss Whitney, representing Northern, and\r\nMr. and Mrs. Braly, Mrs. Ringrose and Mrs. French, Southern\r\nCalifornia, went to Louisville, Ky., to carry the report to the\r\nconvention of the National Association, of which this State had\r\nforty-five life members, more than any other except New York.\r\n\r\nNo State convention had been held in 1911 but one was called to meet\r\nin San Francisco in January, 1912, and it was decided to maintain the\r\nState association to assist the work in neighboring States. Mrs.\r\nWilliam Keith was made president and the officers and executive\r\ncommittee held all day monthly meetings in her home for several years.\r\nAfter the National League of Women Voters was formed in 1919, when\r\nCongress was about to submit the Federal Suffrage Amendment, a meeting\r\nwas held on Feb. 12, 1920, and a California branch was formed with\r\nMrs. Robert J. Burdette as chairman.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe demand of the newly enfranchised women for guidance and knowledge\r\nwas met at once by the College League, which reorganized in November,\r\n1911, and became the California Civic League for social service,\r\neducation for citizenship and the promotion of just legislation. The\r\nexcellent work of Miss Charlotte Anita Whitney was recognized by\r\ncontinuing her as president of the new league from 1911 to 1914. It is\r\ncomposed of about twenty-five centers in the cities and towns of\r\nNorthern California, with a membership of nearly 4,000 and many\r\ncenters wield a strong influence in municipal affairs.\r\n\r\nThe Women's Legislative Council of California was organized in\r\nDecember, 1912, the outgrowth of the Legislative Committee of the\r\nState Federation of Women's Clubs. This council, which is\r\nnon-sectarian, non-partisan and non-political, is in reality a Central\r\nCommittee of State, county and some local organizations--about sixty\r\nin all--representing a membership of over 100,000 women. Its purpose\r\nis to coordinate the efforts and concentrate the influence of women's\r\norganizations behind a legislative program, especially for the benefit\r\nof women and children. A list of at least thirty excellent laws since\r\nthe enfranchisement of women have been either directly sponsored by\r\nthis council or greatly aided by the efforts of women.[18]\r\n\r\nSpace can not be given for local societies but the suffrage history of\r\nCalifornia seems to require the mention of one--the Susan B. Anthony\r\nClub. It was formed in the hour of defeat In 1896 in honor of the\r\ngreat pioneer, who had worked with the California women through all\r\nthat long campaign, and in order to hold together some of those who\r\nhad shared in the toil and the disappointment. The club was formed in\r\nthe home of Mrs. Mary S. Sperry in San Francisco and she was its\r\npresident many years. Other presidents were Mrs. Sargent, wife of U.\r\nS. Senator Sargent, who in 1878 first introduced the Federal Suffrage\r\nAmendment; Mrs. Swift, wife of John F. Swift, Minister to Japan; Mrs.\r\nWilliam Keith, wife of the distinguished artist; Mrs. Isabel A.\r\nBaldwin and Mrs. Nellie Holbrook Blinn, all officers of the State\r\nSuffrage Association also at different times. Dr. Alida C. Avery was\r\nits treasurer and Mrs. Sarah G. Pringle its press representative for a\r\nnumber of years. Its membership comprised many influential women, it\r\nheld regular meetings and was a liberal contributor to suffrage work\r\nin California and other States. In 1911, when all the suffrage clubs\r\nwere disbanding, this one remained in existence and continued to hold\r\nsocial meetings for many years.\r\n\r\nIn 1916-17 the Committee of Political Science of the State Federation\r\nof Women's Clubs, Mrs. Seward A. Simons, president, made a Survey of\r\nthe results of five years of woman suffrage in California, which was\r\nwidely circulated. It was a most valuable résumé of the registration\r\nand the vote of women, the legislation they had obtained, the offices\r\nthey had held, their service on juries, their political work and the\r\neffect of the suffrage on women and on public life. A very complete\r\nreport was made also by Mrs. Coolidge, president of the Civic League.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE AND CONVENTION ACTION. 1901. A bill for School suffrage\r\nwas defeated.\r\n\r\n1905. A resolution to submit a constitutional amendment was defeated\r\nin both Houses by large majorities. A bill legalizing prize fighting\r\nwas passed the same day.\r\n\r\n1906. A Suffrage State Central Committee of twenty-one competent\r\nworkers was organized, Mrs. Lillian Harris Coffin, chairman, Mrs.\r\nKatharine Reed Balentine, secretary, and it continued its activities\r\nin behalf of an amendment to the State constitution for the next five\r\nyears. The plan was to secure its endorsement by all conventions and\r\norganizations and have it incorporated in the platforms of the\r\npolitical parties and the Central Committee was divided into\r\nsub-committees with representatives in every part of the State. The\r\nExecutive of this Central Committee, Mrs. Mary S. Sperry, Mrs. Nellie\r\nHolbrook Blinn, Mrs. Helen Moore and Mrs. Coffin, were the delegates\r\nto the State Republican convention in Santa Cruz in 1906, which was\r\ncompletely under the control of the \"machine.\" It was at this\r\nconvention that the \"insurgent\" sentiment began to crystallize into\r\nthe \"progressive\" movement. Woman suffrage was not put in the\r\nplatform. James G. Gillette, nominated for Governor, approached the\r\nwomen and pledged himself, if elected, to do all he could to carry\r\nthrough the amendment. Later, at Sacramento, the Democratic\r\nconvention, under the leadership of Thomas E. Hayden, Albert Johnson,\r\nMax Popper and John Sweeny, incorporated the amendment in the\r\nplatform. It was placed in the platform of the Labor party, Miss Maud\r\nYounger and Mrs. Francis S. Gibson assisting the Legislative\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n1907. The Legislature of this year was the last under the complete\r\ndomination of the corrupt political forces. The graft prosecution in\r\nSan Francisco was in full swing, the result of which was an awakened\r\npublic conscience. Every legislator had been interviewed and the San\r\nFrancisco delegation was pledged in favor of the suffrage amendment.\r\nIt was introduced by Senator Leroy Wright of San Diego and in the\r\nHouse of Grove L. Johnson of Sacramento the first week of the session.\r\nMrs. Coffin, Mrs. Moore and Thomas E. Hayden, an attorney retained by\r\nthe State association, were the lobby maintained in Sacramento during\r\nthe entire session. The amendment was reported favorably out of\r\ncommittee in both Houses. When the roll was called in the House it was\r\ndiscovered that the San Francisco delegates had received orders and\r\nthe entire delegation voted \"no.\" The result was a bare majority and\r\nnot two-thirds. On demand of the suffrage lobby Mr. Johnson obtained\r\nreconsideration. When the vote was next taken it showed that the San\r\nFrancisco delegation had been again instructed and voted solid for the\r\namendment, giving the necessary two-thirds, 54 to 16. Thus was this\r\ncity able to control every measure.\r\n\r\nThen began the long struggle in the Senate. President pro tem. Edward\r\nI. Wolf of San Francisco and Senator J. B. Sanford of Ukiah,\r\nRepublican and Democratic senior Senators, were bitter opponents of\r\nthe amendment of long years' standing. After weeks of effort, with a\r\ndeadlock of constantly changing votes and always \"one more to get,\" it\r\nwas decided to appeal to Governor Gillette to redeem his pledge of\r\nhelp and Mrs. Coffin and Mr. Hayden called upon him at the Capitol. He\r\nreceived them without rising or inviting them to be seated and wholly\r\nrepudiated the promises he had made to the women at the Republican\r\nconvention, saying he was only fooling! The amendment went down to\r\ndefeat, lacking two votes.\r\n\r\n1908. The Democratic convention in Stockton in 1908 again incorporated\r\nthe amendment in the platform. The Labor convention did likewise, Mrs.\r\nEdith DeLong Jarmuth rendering valuable service on the committee. The\r\nconvention of the Republican party, the dominant one, was held in\r\nOakland. The Suffrage State Central Committee opened headquarters at\r\nthe Hotel Metropole simultaneously with the Republicans, much to their\r\nchagrin. Rooms were also opened in the Bacon Block, financed by the\r\nOakland Amendment League, who were coming to lobby. Three hundred\r\nwomen marched in the first suffrage parade in the State behind a\r\nyellow silk suffrage banner, with the State coat of arms richly\r\nembroidered on it by Mrs. Theodore Pinther, who carried it to reserved\r\nseats in the front of the gallery of the McDonough Theater, where the\r\nconvention was held. Mrs. Sperry, Mrs. Pease of Colorado and a\r\ncommittee of eight women representing as many separate interests had\r\nspoken before the Resolutions Committee the evening before, with two\r\nminutes allotted to each. Mrs. Josephine Manahan, Miss Younger, Mrs.\r\nLaRue, Mrs. Barron and Mrs. O'Donnell composed the labor committee.\r\nFilling the galleries and boxes the suffragists waited for the result.\r\nIn lieu of a suffrage plank the Republican chairman stepped forth and\r\nin his pleasantest manner thanked the women for their attendance,\r\nassuring them that by their grace and beauty they had contributed\r\nmaterially to the success of the convention. Mrs. Pease, who was\r\nseated in the front row, rose and answered that the women were not\r\nthere for bouquets but for justice and declined their thanks.\r\n\r\n1909. This year the amendment was in the middle of the stream. It had\r\nthe promise of support from individual members but the party leaders\r\nhad declined assistance. The Progressives felt topheavy with reforms\r\nand feared to be overbalanced if it were adopted as part of their\r\nprogram. They had the majority in both Houses but failing to secure\r\nany part of the organization they were left off of all important\r\ncommittees and were on the outside. Apartments for the suffrage lobby,\r\nunder the care of Mrs. E. L. Campbell, were opened near the Capitol.\r\nDelegates from many parts of the State were constantly arriving to\r\nrelieve the others, with the exception of Mrs. Coffin and Mrs. Moore,\r\nwho were in constant attendance and with other members of the\r\ncommittees and Mrs. Elizabeth Lowe Watson, the president, carried the\r\nburden of the work. Assemblyman Johnson again introduced the\r\namendment. A ruling was made, aimed at the women, that no lobbyists\r\nshould be permitted on the floor of the Assembly. To the amazement of\r\nevery one the women began to secure votes. The Judiciary Committee\r\nrecommended the amendment and it came up as a special order. Speaker\r\nPhilip A. Stanton was an avowed opponent, as was Assemblyman J. P.\r\nTransue, floor leader, both of Los Angeles. The San Francisco\r\ndelegation, under the direction of Assemblyman J. J. McManus, lined up\r\nwith them. The debate lasted an hour. Assemblymen Otis, Telfer,\r\nJuilliard and Hinkel were among those speaking for the amendment. The\r\natmosphere seemed favorable but at 12 o'clock, when the vote should\r\nhave been taken, to the amazement of its friends, Mr. Johnson moved\r\nfor a recess until one o'clock. In that hour every possible pressure\r\nwas brought to bear against the amendment. When the session reconvened\r\nthe galleries were packed with persons there in the interest of the\r\nrace-track bill and the suffrage lobby were compelled to sit on the\r\nsteps. Without preliminaries the amendment went down to defeat, Mr.\r\nJohnson refusing to ask for reconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe members of the suffrage lobby toured the State, telling the story\r\nof the legislative defeat and showing what would be the benefits of a\r\ndirect primary law. During the Chautauqua meeting in the Yosemite in\r\nJuly, through the efforts of Assemblyman Drew of Fresno, an entire day\r\nand evening were granted for an excellent suffrage program of a strong\r\npolitical flavor with Mrs. Ray, Mrs. Coffin and Mrs. Gamage in charge.\r\n\r\n1910. The reform element in the Legislature did succeed in enacting a\r\ndirect primary law, which, although imperfect, enabled the voters for\r\nthe first time in the history of the State to speak for themselves.\r\nStimulated and encouraged the Republican State convention of 1910 met\r\nin San Francisco and was dominated by the progressive element. The\r\ngood government forces had been successful in Los Angeles and had\r\nunanimously included the suffrage plank in their county platform, J.\r\nH. Braly assisting in this result. Santa Clara county under the\r\nleadership of Charles Blaney had done likewise, and the delegates came\r\nto the State convention prepared to force its adoption. It needed that\r\nsolid front of eighty-three votes from south of the Tehachapi and the\r\nmilitant argument of the sturdy Santa Clara delegation to bring the\r\nSan Francisco leaders into line. The amendment plank was taken up by\r\nthe Resolutions Committee, of which Harris Weinstock was chairman, and\r\ngiven the same careful consideration accorded every other proposed\r\nplank. The women attended the convention in numbers but were not\r\nrequired to go before this committee, which adopted it unanimously. It\r\nwas adopted as part of the platform by the convention with three\r\ncheers. Thus it became a man's measure and the policy of the\r\nProgressive Republican party. To the regret of many prominent\r\nsupporters of the amendment in the Democratic ranks the convention of\r\nthat party failed to endorse it. The reason was simple--the \"machine\"\r\nforces which had hitherto dominated the Republican conventions now\r\nconcentrated their strength on the Democratic. A progressive\r\nLegislature was nominated and a man for Governor who had sufficient\r\ncourage to carry out a progressive program--Hiram W. Johnson--the\r\nwomen contributing to his success in not a few counties. The election\r\nwas a Progressive victory and the chairman of the Republican State\r\nCentral Committee called a meeting of its members and the members\r\nelect of the Legislature for 1911 at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco\r\nand appointed committees for assisting the legislators in carrying out\r\nthe promises of the platform. A committee of the leading legislators\r\nwas appointed to see that a woman suffrage amendment to the\r\nconstitution was submitted.\r\n\r\n1911. The action taken in 1911 has been described.\r\n\r\nIn 1915 the Legislature by unanimous vote of both Houses passed\r\nresolutions which said in part:\r\n\r\n     Resolved, That so successful has been the operation and effect of\r\n     granting political rights to women that it is generally conceded\r\n     that, were the question to be again voted on by the people of\r\n     this State, it would be reendorsed by an overwhelming majority;\r\n     and be it further\r\n\r\n     Resolved, That the adoption of woman suffrage by California is\r\n     one of the important factors contributing to the marked\r\n     political, social and industrial advancement made by our people\r\n     in recent years.\r\n\r\nIn 1917 in the midst of the war, when the Federal Suffrage Amendment\r\nwas hanging in the balance in Congress, a petition from the State\r\nFederation of Women's Clubs was sent to the Legislature through Mrs.\r\nAlfred Bartlett of Los Angeles that it would memorialize Congress on\r\nthe subject. Without a dissenting vote the following passed both\r\nHouses in just twelve minutes: \"Whereas, the women of the United\r\nStates are being called upon to share the burdens and sacrifices of\r\nthe present national crisis and they are patriotically responding to\r\nthat call, be it Resolved by the Senate of California with the\r\nAssembly concurring that the denial of the right of women to vote on\r\nequal terms with men is an injustice and we do urge upon Congress the\r\nsubmission to the Legislatures of the States for their ratification of\r\nan amendment to the U. S. Constitution granting women the right to\r\nvote.\"\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. Governor William D. Stephens called the Legislature to\r\nmeet in special session Nov. 1, 1919, for the one purpose of ratifying\r\nthe Federal Amendment, which had been submitted June 4. The Women's\r\nLegislative Council had unanimously urged this action in convention.\r\nMore than a hundred members of the various suffrage societies went to\r\nSacramento and before the vote was taken they gave a luncheon for the\r\nlegislators, which was attended by the Governor, Lieutenant Governor\r\nand State officials. The speakers were the Governor and the presidents\r\nof many State organizations of women. The ratification was not a\r\nmatter of controversy and the vote in favor was unanimous in the\r\nSenate, 73 to 2 in the House--Robert Madison of Santa Rosa and C. W.\r\nGreene of Paso Robles.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mary L. Cheney, secretary of the University of California,\r\nprepared for this chapter a complete list of the offices filled by\r\nwomen and the positions held by women in the universities, which the\r\nlack of space compelled to be omitted. In 1918 for the first time four\r\nwere elected to the Legislature and received important committee\r\nappointments and there have been a few other women legislators. In San\r\nFrancisco a Doctor of Jurisprudence of the University of California,\r\nMrs. Annette Abbott Adams, was the first in the country to hold the\r\nposition of U. S. District Attorney. In 1920 another, Miss Frances H.\r\nWilson, was assistant district attorney. On the teaching force of the\r\nState University at Berkeley were ninety-three women in December,\r\n1919, including Dr. Jessica Peixotto, full professor of economics,\r\nthree associate and seven assistant professors and two assistant\r\nprofessors in the medical college. At Leland Stanford Junior\r\nUniversity are one woman professor emeritus (psychology); two\r\nassociate professors, eight assistant professors--over 40 women on the\r\nteaching force.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] For the \"assembling\" of the different parts of this chapter and\r\nmuch of the work on it the History is indebted to Mary McHenry (Mrs.\r\nWilliam) Keith, president of the State Equal Suffrage Association; for\r\nLegislative Action to Mrs. Lillian Harris Coffin, chairman of the\r\nState Legislative Committee; for matter on Southern California to Miss\r\nM. Frances Wills and Mrs. Adelia D. Wade.\r\n\r\n[11] Mrs. Sperry was reelected the next six years. Miss Carrie A.\r\nWhelan and Miss Clara Schlingheyde were retained six years as\r\ncorresponding secretary and treasurer. Others who held State offices\r\nduring the years were Mrs. Chapman, Mrs. Corbert, Dr. Minora Kibbe,\r\nMrs. Alice L. Park, Mrs. Osborne, Dr. Charlotte Baker, Miss Belle\r\nAngier, Miss Josephine R. Cole, Rev. Mrs. Wilkes, Dr. Avery, Mrs.\r\nBlinn, Mrs. M. A. Woog, Mrs. Chapman J. Arnott, Mrs. Nellie S.\r\nScoville, Mrs. Lulu Pyle Little, Mrs. Josephine Mastick, Mrs. Therese\r\nS.

It was shipped\r\nto her home in Rochester, N. Y., the day before the earthquake of\r\nApril 18, but it escaped destruction by fire only to meet with mishap\r\nafter the death of Miss Mary S. Anthony, to whom it had been presented\r\nby the wife of the artist. Miss Anthony was shown seated near an open\r\nwindow from which a beautiful sunset was seen; a lavender robe and a\r\ncrimson curtain background set off the face and figure in fine relief.\r\n\r\n[13] Mrs. Keith was by no means a woman of wealth but it was said that\r\nduring the years that led up to the campaign and in the campaign her\r\ncontributions amounted to about $15,000.--Ed.\r\n\r\n[14] Among the early workers, besides those already mentioned, were:\r\nMrs. Charlotte LeMoyne Wills, Mrs. Mila Tupper Maynard, Mrs. Lulu Pyle\r\nLittle, Mrs. Sarah Wilde Houser, Mrs. Josephine Marlett, Mrs. Alice E.\r\nBrodwell, Mrs. Mary A. Kenney, Mrs. Mary Alderman Garbutt, Mrs. Martha\r\nSalyer, Miss Margaret M. Fette, Mrs. Cora D. Lewis.\r\n\r\n[15] Among the names that constantly occur in the State work as\r\nspeakers, writers, on committees, etc., besides those specially\r\nmentioned, are Mrs. Emma Shafter Howard, Miss Mary S.

Krebs,\r\nMiss Ina Coolbrith, Mrs. Nellie Blessing Eyster, Mrs. Frances\r\nWilliamson.\r\n\r\nThe comprehensive booklet published by Miss Selina Solomons, \"How We\r\nWon the Vote in California,\" preserves scores of these names and\r\ncontains a wealth of details in regard to this interesting campaign.\r\n\r\n[16] After the election was over the College League at a general\r\nrequest issued a pamphlet of 139 pages, edited by Louise Herrick Wall,\r\ndescribing in detail its many activities during the campaign, every\r\npage of which is a record of marvelous work.\r\n\r\n[17] The consideration of Secretary of State Frank Jordan was\r\nappreciated in placing the amendment on the ballot with an explanatory\r\nfootnote that would prevent any one from not recognizing it. The\r\nvictory was partly due to this advantage.\r\n\r\n[18] The very complete résumé of the activities of these organizations\r\nmade by Miss Martha A. Ijams, Council Secretary, had to be much\r\ncondensed for lack of space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nCOLORADO.[19]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Colorado the period from 1900 to 1920 began and ended with a\r\nvictory for equal suffrage. In 1901 the woman suffrage law of 1893 was\r\nby vote of the people made a part of the State constitution. In 1919 a\r\nspecial session of the Legislature ratified the Federal Suffrage\r\nAmendment. A half-century ago, Jan. 4, 1870, Governor Edward M. McCook\r\nin his biennial report to the Territorial Legislature had urged it to\r\nbe a leader in this \"movement of progressive civilization,\" but it was\r\ntwenty-three years later when the lone example of the sister State,\r\nWyoming, was followed and Colorado became the second State to\r\nenfranchise woman.\r\n\r\nWhen Colorado was admitted into the Union in 1876 a strong effort was\r\nmade to have its constitution provide for equal suffrage but it was\r\nnot successful. School suffrage was given and provision was made that\r\nthe Legislature might at any time submit a measure to the voters for\r\nthe complete franchise, which, if accepted by the majority, should\r\nbecome law. This was done in 1877 and defeated. It was submitted again\r\nin 1893 and adopted by a majority of 6,347. Women were thus entitled\r\nto vote on the same terms as men but it was by law and not by\r\nconstitutional amendment. Aliens could vote on six months' residence\r\nand on their \"first papers,\" without completing their citizenship. In\r\n1901 the Legislature submitted the following amendment: \"Every person\r\nover the age of twenty-one years, possessing the following\r\nqualifications, shall be entitled to vote at all elections: He or she\r\nshall be a citizen of the United States and shall have resided in the\r\nState twelve months immediately preceding the election at which he or\r\nshe offers to vote.\" It is worthy of note that Casimero Barela, known\r\nas the perpetual Senator who had opposed equal suffrage since the\r\nquestion was first raised in Territorial days, esteemed it a privilege\r\nto introduce the resolution for this amendment. The vote on Nov. 4,\r\n1901, stood, ayes, 35,372; noes, 20,087; carried by a majority of\r\n15,285, which was nearly 64 per cent. of the vote cast. After a trial\r\nof eight years the voters, men and women, thus securely entrenched\r\nwoman suffrage in the State constitution.\r\n\r\nThe Equal Suffrage Association has continued its existence in order to\r\nassist the women in other States to get the franchise and also to look\r\nafter legislative and civic affairs at home. It has not held annual\r\nconventions but its regular monthly meetings have taken place for\r\nyears at the Adams Hotel in Denver where they could be attended by\r\nmembers from all parts of the State and strangers within the gates\r\nfrom this or other countries. The presidents after Mrs. John L. Routt\r\nretired were, Mrs. Katherine T. Patterson, Mrs. Amy K. Cornwall,\r\nProfessor Theodosia G. Ammons, Mrs. Minerva C. Welch, Mrs. Harriet G.\r\nR. Wright (8 years), Mrs. Dora Phelps Buell, Mrs. Honora McPhearson,\r\nMrs. Lucy I. Harrington, Mrs. Katherine Tipton Hosmer, 1918.\r\n\r\nThree of these presidents have passed over the range, Mrs. Routt, wife\r\nof the former Governor; Mrs. Patterson, wife of U. S. Senator Thomas\r\nM. Patterson, and Professor Ammons, who established the department of\r\ndomestic science in the Colorado Agricultural College. Two eminent and\r\nhighly valued suffragists who have passed away are Mrs. Sarah Platt\r\nDecker and the Hon. Isaac N. Stevens. Mrs. Decker, one of the most\r\naccomplished and forceful of women, was president of the State Board\r\nof Charities and Corrections and vice-president of the first State\r\nCivil Service Commission from 1909 until her death July 7, 1912, in\r\nCalifornia during the biennial of the General Federation of Women's\r\nClubs, of which she had been president. Mr. Stevens, editor for years\r\nof the Colorado Springs _Gazette_ and later of the _Pueblo Chieftain_,\r\nmember of the Legislature and prominent in politics, was always an\r\nardent and influential supporter of woman suffrage. Among the pioneer\r\nworkers who are still living are Mrs. Ione T. Hanna, the first woman\r\nelected member of a school board in the State; Mrs. Alma V. Lafferty\r\nand Mrs. Harriet G. R. Wright, former members of the Legislature; Dr.\r\nMary Barker-Bates, Dr. Minnie C. T. Love, Mrs. William N. Byers, Mrs.\r\nJames B. Belford and Mrs. Celia Baldwin Whitehead.[20]\r\n\r\nThe State Association has been non-partisan but its members personally\r\nhave been connected with the various parties. This does not mean that\r\nthey always have voted a straight party ticket; they have not, neither\r\nhave men, and scratched tickets are common. Women do not necessarily\r\n\"vote just as their husbands do\" but many a pair go amicably to the\r\npolls and with perfect good feeling nullify each other's vote. It is a\r\nnoteworthy fact that during all the years no bill which the State\r\nassociation actively opposed has been passed by the General Assembly\r\nand every bill which it actively supported has been enacted into law.\r\nIt has thus conclusively been proved that, while women must band\r\nthemselves together for bettering the condition of their sex and for\r\nthe general good of the State, yet having planned together they must\r\nwork out their problems through their political parties. The\r\nassociation has consistently opposed the so-called National Woman's\r\nParty with its \"militant\" methods, giving wide publicity to\r\nresolutions adopted Oct. 2, 1917, which said: \"We denounce the methods\r\nand actions of the women 'picketing' the White House as unpatriotic\r\nand not in accord with the principles of this association; we declare\r\nthey have impugned the good faith of the United States in the eyes of\r\nRussia and other foreign nations ... and we request the Attorney\r\nGeneral of the United States to institute an investigation of the\r\nassociation supporting the 'pickets' and the sources of its money\r\nsupply....\"\r\n\r\nThough actively engaged with serious problems of State government, of\r\ncity administration and of home economics, the association has never\r\noverlooked the fact that social activities are essential to good\r\ngovernment and right living and has made its social affairs a\r\nnoteworthy feature during the past years.\r\n\r\nThere has never been any question among the people generally in\r\nColorado as to the benefit of woman suffrage. Sanitary conditions are\r\nimproved, beginning at everybody's back yard and extending through\r\nevery business place and every public domain in the State. Business\r\nmethods are different. Visiting women say they can tell when in the\r\nlarge department stores, groceries, etc., that the women are voters.\r\nPolitical campaigns are very differently conducted since women have a\r\npart in them. Election methods have changed to make election day what\r\nthe men deem fitting since their wives, mothers and sisters are voters\r\nand the polling places are unobjectionable. Not only has it been\r\nconceded that the commonwealth has been blest by the votes of the\r\nwomen but also that the women themselves have been benefited; their\r\nlives have been enriched by their broadening experiences; their larger\r\nvision has made possible greater culture; their wider opportunity for\r\ndoing has led to more deeds of kindness; their interest in State\r\ngovernment and civic economics has improved their ideas of home\r\ngovernment and domestic economy; their assistance in State and civic\r\n\"house-cleaning\" has imbued them with a higher sense of duty to\r\nsociety and their own homes.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time wholly unwarranted attacks were made on the effects\r\nof woman suffrage in Colorado in order to prevent its adoption in\r\nother States. During 1908-9 the misrepresentations became so vicious\r\nthere was a general feeling that as the men voters largely outnumbered\r\nthe women they should not remain silent. Through the efforts of\r\nAssistant District Attorney Omar E. Garwood the Equal Suffrage Aid\r\nAssociation of men was formed with former Governor Alva Adams\r\npresident; Isaac N. Stevens, vice-president, and Mr. Garwood\r\nsecretary. Prominent men joined it and it rendered such excellent\r\nservice in giving authoritative information that in a few years the\r\nattacks and misrepresentations almost wholly ceased. Mr. Garwood went\r\non to New York, where the National Men's League for Woman Suffrage was\r\norganized with James Lees Laidlaw of New York City as president and\r\nMr. Garwood as secretary. He aided in forming similar leagues in other\r\nStates and for several years participated actively in the suffrage\r\ncampaigns of Kansas, Michigan, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska and South\r\nDakota, and lectured as far south as Mississippi, finding much\r\ninterest in Colorado's experiment. It was believed that the men's\r\norganizations, actively taking the stand for the enfranchisement of\r\nwomen, contributed substantially to the ultimate success of the\r\nmovement. In 1915 and following years an obscure lawyer employed by\r\ncertain vested interests in Colorado and elsewhere went into eastern\r\nStates where suffrage amendments were pending and scattered false\r\nstatements about the situation in this State. The newspapers of the\r\nEast were flooded with denials by Colorado men, women and\r\norganizations and when they published these he filed suits for libel\r\nbut never allowed one of them to come to trial.\r\n\r\nAgain and again the Legislature has given official testimony in favor\r\nof woman suffrage when it would be helpful. On Jan. 2, 1919, when the\r\nU. S. Senate was about to vote on submitting the Federal Amendment,\r\nMrs. Hosmer, president of the State Association; Mrs. Anna M. Scott,\r\nfirst vice-president, and Mrs. Sarah K. Walling, a member of the board\r\nof directors, went before the Legislature at the opening of the\r\nsession, asking for a memorial to the Senate urging favorable action.\r\nIn less than an hour the rules had been suspended in both Houses and\r\nthe following resolution passed unanimously:\r\n\r\n     Whereas, Colorado has long enjoyed the help and counsel of its\r\n     women in all political matters of citizenship and by these years\r\n     of experience demonstrated the benefit to be derived from equal\r\n     suffrage; and whereas, there is now pending in the Senate of the\r\n     United States a constitutional amendment providing for national\r\n     woman suffrage; therefore be it\r\n\r\n     Resolved, that we urge the United States Senate to take up and\r\n     submit this amendment at the earliest possible date in order that\r\n     all the women of the nation may have the right of suffrage and\r\n     the nation may have the benefit of their citizenship.\r\n\r\nBoth Democratic and Republican parties, and the Populist and\r\nProgressive parties when they existed, have stood for equal suffrage\r\nand unequivocally endorsed it in their platforms. The appointment of\r\nvice-chairwomen of the political State Committees is a foregone\r\nconclusion. During the memorable campaign of 1914, Mrs. Steele, wife\r\nof the late Chief Justice Robert W. Steele, successfully filled this\r\nplace in the Democratic party during a time fraught with difficulties,\r\nas the then Congressional Union opened headquarters in Denver to\r\noppose every Democratic candidate for Congress under the excuse of\r\nholding the party in federal power responsible. The injection of such\r\na movement in a State where equal suffrage had long been in force and\r\nthe women had allied themselves with the parties of their choice,\r\ncreated among them a keen resentment and acrimonious controversy. The\r\nDemocratic Senator, Charles S. Thomas, and Democratic Representatives\r\nwho had always been friends of woman suffrage, were re-elected.\r\n\r\nBeginning with 1908 the following women were sent as delegates or\r\nalternates to the presidential nominating conventions: Mary C. C.\r\nBradford, Katherine Cook, Anna H. Pitzer, Eugenia Kelley, Nancy\r\nKirkland, Helen L. Grenfell, Alice B. Clark, Mary Nichols and Anna M.\r\nScott. The following have served as presidential electors: Gertrude A.\r\nLee, Sarah K. Walling, Adella Bailey, Julie Penrose, Anna Wolcott\r\nVaile.\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 1, 1919, one of the most important receptions in Denver was\r\ngiven by the State Equal Suffrage Association to the new Governor,\r\nOliver H. Shoup (Republican) and his wife, and the retiring Governor,\r\nJulius C. Gunter (Democrat) and his wife. Both were on the board of\r\ndirectors of the association. It was held in the roof ballroom of the\r\nAdams Hotel and was a most democratic affair, all classes being\r\nrepresented, as all had found a common interest in public welfare. A\r\nfew months later the association gave a handsomely appointed luncheon\r\nat the Adams with Senator Agnes Riddle as guest of honor. Its purpose\r\nwas to show appreciation of her heroic stand for women when she voted\r\nagainst the male appointee of the Governor of her own party to take\r\nthe place of a woman expert (a member of the other party) on the Board\r\nof Charities and Correction.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1919, when it was known that the Federal Suffrage Amendment\r\nwas certain to be submitted in a short time, the State Association\r\nrequested Governor Shoup to be in readiness to call a special session\r\nof the Legislature so quickly that Colorado might be the first State\r\nto ratify. It offered to supply without salary or compensation of any\r\nkind all necessary clerks, stenographers, pages and sergeants-at-arms\r\nin order that the State should be put to no expense except for the\r\nmileage of the legislators, whose salaries are paid by the year. When\r\nthe amendment was finally submitted on June 4 the newspapers, which\r\nhad been loyal to the cause all these years, and the men and women\r\nwhose interest and support had never flagged, were overjoyed with\r\nthanksgiving and jubilation. The _Rocky Mountain Herald_ of Denver was\r\none of the first papers to support the Equal Suffrage Association in\r\nasking for an immediate ratification by a special session of the\r\nLegislature. The Governor promised to call one eventually but would\r\nnot consent to do it at once, claiming that legislators from the\r\nfarming districts asked for delay. Every possible influence was\r\nbrought to bear on him but the situation remained unchanged. \"For\r\nreasons\" the party in power (Republican) decreed that, while of course\r\nthe special session must be held, this could not be done until fall or\r\nwinter. The members of the association, knowing the futility of\r\nfurther effort, proceeded to arrange for a public jubilee.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was held in the City Park of Denver on the night of June\r\n25 in connection with a concert by the city band. Mrs. Hosmer presided\r\nand prayer was offered by Mrs. Almira Frost Hudson. Jubilant speeches\r\nwere made by Mrs. Harrington, State Senator E. V. Dunkley and Captain\r\nMorrison Shafroth to an audience of about 1,500. Governor Shoup was\r\nout of the city but sent a letter to be read. The Mayor was\r\nrepresented by Commissioner J. W. Sharpley. At the Fourth of July\r\ncelebration held under the auspices of the Colorado Patriotic League\r\nat the same place, the president of the State suffrage association was\r\none of the speakers. Her subject was \"Woman's First Fourth of July\"\r\nand so this celebration also took on the nature of a rejoicing over\r\nthe new women electorate of the nation.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. The Legislature met in special session Dec. 8, 1919, and\r\na resolution for ratification was introduced in Senate and House, in\r\nthe latter bearing the names of the two women Representatives, Dr. May\r\nT. Bigelow and Miss Mable Ruth Baker, and that of the Senate the name\r\nof the one woman member, Senator Agnes Riddle, and as passed it bore\r\nall three names. It requires three days for action on a resolution and\r\nthe ratification was completed on the 12th, both Houses voting\r\nunanimously in favor. The day of the final passage was made a great\r\noccasion for the Equal Suffrage Association. Legislators referred to\r\nit in their speeches and Mrs. Walling, one of its board of directors,\r\nwas escorted to a seat beside Speaker Allyn Cole. Mrs. Hosmer was out\r\nof the city. A short recess was taken that the first vice-president,\r\nMrs. Anna M. Scott, might be heard, who made a brief but eloquent\r\nspeech. When the time came for the final vote Speaker Cole surrendered\r\nhis place to Representative Bigelow, so that a woman might wield the\r\ngavel when the result was announced.[21] The bill went immediately to\r\nthe Governor, who signed it on the 15th. Colorado had by this\r\nratification placed the seal of her approval on the twenty-six years\r\nof woman suffrage in the State.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, the Woman's State Council of Defense was a most\r\nefficient organization, Governor Gunter saying that he ascribed its\r\nremarkable work to the experience which the women had gained by their\r\nquarter-of-a-century of active citizenship. On June 17, 1920, the\r\nState Equal Suffrage Association became incorporated under the name of\r\nthe League of Women Voters with Mrs. Scott as chairman. A number of\r\nprominent eastern women en route to the Democratic national convention\r\nin San Francisco stopped at Denver and were guests at the banquet in\r\ncelebration of the new league.\r\n\r\nThe legislative council of the State Federation of Women's Clubs holds\r\nweekly meetings during the sessions of the Legislature and takes up\r\nbills for consideration, particularly those relating to women and\r\nchildren, education and public health. After discussion and study\r\nthese bills are approved or not approved and the legislators, the club\r\nwomen and the general public are informed as to their action.\r\n\r\nThere is no law prohibiting women from filling any offices in the\r\nState and it has been said that a really determined effort could place\r\na woman even in that of chief executive. The office of State\r\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction has been filled by a woman since\r\n1894 and no man has been nominated for it. Those who have held this\r\nimportant office are Antoinette J. Peavey, Grace Espey Patton, Helen\r\nL. Grenfell (three terms), Katharine Craig, Katharine Cook, Helen M.\r\nWixson (two terms), Mary C. C. Bradford from 1915 to the present time.\r\nDuring her second term she was elected president of the National\r\nEducation Association. Mrs. Walling succeeded Mrs. Sarah Platt Decker\r\nas vice-president of the Civil Service Commission and served six\r\nyears. In 1913 Mrs. Alice Adams Fulton became secretary and chief\r\nexaminer of the commission. Mrs. Mary Wolfe Dargin was appointed\r\nregister of the U. S. Land Office in 1915 and Miss Clara Ruth Mozzer\r\nto the office of Assistant Attorney General in 1917. There have been\r\nwomen clerks, auditors, recorders and treasurers in seventy-five\r\ncities and towns, including Denver, and several aldermen. Mrs. Lydia\r\nTague was elected judge in Eagle county. A few years ago 600 women\r\nwere serving on school boards.\r\n\r\nPrior to the year 1900 nine women had sat in the House of\r\nRepresentatives--three in each Legislature after the passage of the\r\nequal suffrage law, and there have been nine or ten since then, a\r\nnumber of them re-elected. In 1913 Colorado's first woman Senator,\r\nMrs. Helen Ring Robinson, was elected. She was the second in the equal\r\nsuffrage States, Mrs. Martha Hughes Cannno of Utah the first. In 1917\r\nMrs. Agnes Riddle was elected.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] The History is indebted for this chapter to Katherine Tipton\r\n(Mrs. George E.) Hosmer, president of the State Equal Suffrage\r\nAssociation. Mrs. Hosmer wishes to express her obligation for\r\nassistance in securing data to the past presidents and executive\r\nofficers of the association.\r\n\r\n[20] Among those who worked in the first decade of this century were:\r\nHelen L.

Closely associated with her\r\nduring all these years was Miss Frances Ellen Burr, who was recording\r\nsecretary from 1869 to 1910. Under her leadership and with the aid of\r\nher husband, John Hooker, an eminent lawyer, legislation had been\r\nsecured giving mothers equal guardianship of their children and wives\r\nfull control of their property and earnings. The only concession that\r\nhad been made to the steady demand of the women for suffrage was the\r\ngrant of the School franchise in 1893 and eligibility to the school\r\nboards. Interest in woman suffrage was at a low ebb when the new\r\ncentury opened. The membership of the association had decreased and at\r\nthe State convention in Hartford in 1901 the treasurer's report for\r\nthe year showed an expenditure of only $21.75. The report of the\r\npresident and secretary said: \"The work of the association is confined\r\nto the annual fall convention and the legislative hearing.\"\r\n\r\nA convention for the revision of the State constitution was to meet in\r\nHartford at the opening of 1902, whose delegates from the towns and\r\ncities were chosen in the fall of 1901. Little was done to secure\r\npledges from the candidates but the association obtained the\r\nconcession of a room at the Capitol for its use. The National American\r\nWoman Suffrage Association sent an organizer--Mrs. Mary Seymour Howell\r\nof New York--into the State and paid her salary for four weeks and she\r\nspent seven weeks in Hartford, living with Mrs. Hooker and giving her\r\ntime to the convention. Mrs. Hooker prepared a Memorial that was\r\npresented and referred to a committee, which refused not only to grant\r\na hearing to the suffragists but even to receive for distribution in\r\nthe convention the copies of the Memorial which had been printed.\r\nCharles Hopkins Clark, editor of the _Courant_, was chairman. Two\r\nsuffrage resolutions were presented in the convention at the request\r\nof the State association, by Daniel Davenport of Bridgeport and\r\nColonel Norris Osborn of New Haven, and were defeated without debate.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 the State convention was held at Collinsville, in spite of\r\nsome unwillingness of local suffragists to \"shock the town\" by having\r\nsuch a meeting there. By this time Mrs. Hooker, though still\r\npresident, had largely relinquished the work to Mrs. Elizabeth D.\r\nBacon, the faithful vice-president. A general feeling of\r\ndiscouragement was perceptible in the reports to the convention of\r\n1903, which was held at Mrs. Hooker's home in Hartford with only 21\r\ndelegates present; also to the convention of 1904 in New Haven.\r\nNevertheless it was voted to ask the Legislature for Municipal\r\nsuffrage for women.\r\n\r\nDuring these years the annual expenditures never amounted to $200. In\r\n1905 at the convention in Hartford on November 1 the treasurer\r\nreported that $137 had been spent. In 1906, when the convention was\r\nheld at Meriden, November 2, the disbursements were reported as $162.\r\nThere were only nine delegates and Mrs. Hooker, who had not attended\r\nthe meetings for two years, was made honorary president, and Mrs.\r\nBacon was elected to the presidency. Mrs. Hooker died in January,\r\n1907, at the age of 85, thus taking from the movement one of the most\r\nbrilliant figures of the early period.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1907 was held in Hartford October 29, and the\r\nfollowing year it met in New Haven on October 1. A slightly increased\r\nmembership was reported and some younger women had come into the\r\nmovement, including Mrs. Jessie Adler of Hartford, who was responsible\r\nlater for the candidacy of Mrs. Thomas N. Hepburn. The expenditures\r\nfor 1908 were $265. In 1909 the convention was held at Meriden. It was\r\nreported that the National Association had sent a request to\r\nConnecticut for a petition to Congress with a quota of at least\r\n30,000 signatures but that the number collected had fallen\r\nconsiderably short of 5,000. Miss Caroline Ruutz-Rees, principal of a\r\nflourishing girls' school in Greenwich, attended as a delegate from a\r\nnewly formed Equal Franchise League in that town and several young and\r\nenthusiastic suffragists, including Mrs. Hepburn, who had lately come\r\ninto the State, were in attendance with the delegation from the Equal\r\nRights Club of Hartford.\r\n\r\nIn October Mrs. Emmeline Pankhurst, whose \"militant\" movement in\r\nEngland was attracting world-wide attention, spoke in Hartford. At\r\nthis meeting Mrs. Hepburn met Miss Emily Pierson of Cromwell, a\r\nteacher in the Bristol High School. Both received an inspiration from\r\nMrs. Pankhurst and they began a campaign in Hartford, organizing\r\npublic meetings for which they obtained speakers of national\r\nreputation. To support this work the Hartford Political Equality\r\nLeague (afterwards the Equal Franchise League) was formed with a\r\nmembership at first of four, all of whom were officers. It quickly\r\nattracted members and got into touch with the equally vigorous and\r\nenthusiastic young league in Greenwich.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1910 the State convention was held at Greenwich, with a\r\nlarge delegation from these leagues. These younger members had come to\r\nthe decision that if any active work was to be done there must be a\r\ncomplete change in the management of the State Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation, an idea that was warmly endorsed by some of the older\r\nleaders. A new \"slate\" of officers was presented headed by Mrs.\r\nHepburn, who had consented to nomination on condition that the\r\nGreenwich and the Hartford leagues should each pledge $1,000 for the\r\nwork of the coming year. Miss Burr had resigned three months before\r\nthe convention the secretaryship which she had held over forty years.\r\nThe treasurer, Mrs. Mary Jane Rogers, who had been in office for\r\nsixteen years, was re-elected and continued to serve until 1913. Then\r\non her refusal to accept another term she was elected auditor and held\r\nthe office until her death in 1918. In 1912 ex-presidents were put on\r\nthe executive board and Mrs. Bacon regularly attended the meetings and\r\naided the newer workers with her experience and advice until her death\r\nin 1918. The income for 1910 had been $400, the largest ever\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1911, held in Bridgeport, showed great advance in\r\norganization and general activity. Miss Pierson was elected State\r\norganizer and an automobile tour of one of the eight counties was\r\nundertaken in August under her spirited leadership. Thirty-one\r\nmeetings were held and fourteen new leagues were formed and affiliated\r\nwith the State association. The income was reported at the convention\r\nas having been $3,966 and the enrolled membership had increased to\r\nover 5,000. At this convention Mrs. Hepburn declined re-election on\r\naccount of family duties and Mrs. William T. Hincks, president of a\r\nnew and active league at Bridgeport, was chosen. Mrs. Hepburn remained\r\na useful member of the board.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 the annual convention was held at New Haven, where after much\r\ndifficulty Miss Pierson had organized a flourishing Equal Franchise\r\nLeague with Mrs. Carlos F. Stoddard president. A Political Equality\r\nClub had existed here from before the opening of the century but its\r\nmembership was small and it made no appeal to a large number of women\r\nwho were ready to come out for suffrage. It seemed better, as in\r\nHartford in 1909, to form a new organization with younger leaders.\r\n\r\nThe annual convention in 1913 was held in Hartford. Mrs. Hincks\r\nrefused re-election and Mrs. Hepburn was again chosen, with Mrs. M.\r\nToscan Bennett as treasurer. The work accomplished during the year, as\r\nreported at the convention, had included the collection of 18,000\r\nnames to a petition to the Legislature for full suffrage for women,\r\nwhile campaigns had covered the smaller cities and towns and resulted\r\nin the organization of all the State except one county.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1914 again took place in Hartford and Mrs. Hepburn,\r\nwith practically the whole board, was re-elected. The work of the year\r\nincluded a \"ward campaign,\" in which a beginning was made of\r\norganizing on the lines of a political party, automobile campaigns\r\ncompleting the organization of the whole State; the first suffrage\r\nparade took place in Hartford on May 2. Political work had resulted in\r\nobtaining a woman suffrage plank in the Democratic State platform. The\r\ntotal income for the year was $17,779.\r\n\r\nIn 1915 at the State convention in Hartford Mrs. Hepburn was again\r\nre-elected. The reports included accounts of the activities of the\r\nsixty-nine clubs and leagues affiliated with the State association. In\r\nthe Legislature not only had the suffrage measures been turned down\r\nbut almost all of those favored by the women, owing to the bitter\r\nhostility of the Republican \"machine,\" by which it had long been\r\ndominated. This convention declared in favor of concentrating on State\r\nwork, the majority opinion being that it was as yet of no use to work\r\nfor the Federal Suffrage Amendment. The income for the year was\r\nreported as $19,476, this being entirely apart from the money received\r\nand spent locally by the affiliated leagues. During the year a\r\npetition to submit a State amendment with over 43,000 names of men and\r\nwomen had been collected and presented to the Legislature.[23]\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1916 was held at New Haven and Mrs. Hepburn was\r\nre-elected. The reports showed that the year then ended had been the\r\nmost active in the history of the association. In the winter of\r\n1915-16 work had been undertaken in the counties whose Representatives\r\nhad made the worst showing in the preceding Legislature. Miss Helen\r\nTodd, who had worked in California in 1911 when its victory was\r\ngained, was secured as the principal speaker for a campaign organized\r\nfor her by Miss Catharine Flanagan of Hartford. Other organizers were\r\nMiss Alice Pierson of Cromwell, Miss Katherine Mullen of New Haven and\r\nMiss Daphne Selden of Deep River, Miss Emily Pierson remaining State\r\norganizer and directing the work. In the spring of 1916 Miss Alice\r\nPierson married Ralph Swetman and during the summer both undertook a\r\nhouse to house campaign, with numerous open air meetings in the\r\nsmaller towns of Hartford county. The income for the year was $27,442,\r\nnearly all of which was expended. The membership of the State\r\nassociation by careful count was 32,366 and the affiliated leagues\r\nand clubs numbered eighty-one. During the year a bulletin from\r\nheadquarters was sent twice a month to each dues-paying member. In\r\nJune a delegation went to Chicago and marched under the leadership of\r\nMrs. Grace Gallatin Seton in the great parade of the National Suffrage\r\nAssociation that braved the rain and wind on its way to the Coliseum,\r\nwhere the cause of woman suffrage was presented to the Resolutions\r\nCommittee of the Republican National Convention.\r\n\r\nThe State convention of 1917 was held in Hartford November 7, 8, and\r\nthe reports showed that attention had been concentrated on the three\r\nmeasures before the Legislature--a bill for Presidential and Municipal\r\nsuffrage; a bill for Excise suffrage (a vote in local option), and a\r\nresolution for a State constitutional amendment also but both bills\r\nwere defeated in House and Senate. The amendment resolution, however,\r\nsecured a majority in the House and as the constitution provides that\r\nthe House alone shall consider an amendment on its first presentation,\r\nthis victory insured that it should pass to the next Legislature for\r\nfinal action. Through the whole of 1917 much work also was done for\r\nthe Federal Suffrage Amendment, deputations being sent to each of the\r\nU. S. Senators and Representatives from Connecticut.\r\n\r\nThe suffragists felt the urge of patriotism and Mrs. Hepburn in the\r\nname of the association offered its services to Governor Marcus A.\r\nHolcomb. The offer was graciously received though not definitely\r\naccepted but requests for clerical help came to suffrage headquarters.\r\nIn response some 540 hours of work were given by volunteers. A Central\r\nWar Work Committee, under the auspices of the association, was formed\r\nin April, immediately after the declaration of war, the chairmanship\r\nheld first by Miss Ruutz-Rees, who had been a member of the executive\r\nboard of the association from 1910. When she was made chairman of the\r\nWoman's Division of the State Council of Defense, the chairmanship was\r\ntaken by Miss Katharine Ludington and other leading suffragists gave\r\ntheir services. The War Work Committee had chiefly to do with food\r\nconservation and $5,350 were collected by it for this purpose.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the money contributed by suffragists for war work, the\r\nincome of the association for the year was $29,933. At this convention\r\nMrs. Hepburn, who had been strongly stirred by the jailing of the\r\nmembers of the National Woman's Party at Washington, announced her\r\nintention of working with that organization and Mrs. Bennett refused\r\nre-election for the same reason. Miss Ludington was elected president,\r\nwith Miss Mabel C. Washburn as treasurer. Mrs. Seton, who had been\r\nvice-president since 1910, retained her position and Miss Ruutz-Rees\r\nremained. Miss Ludington had shown her qualifications for the State\r\npresidency, first as president of the Old Lyme Equal Franchise League,\r\nthen as chairman of New London county and during 1917 by her\r\norganizing and executive ability as chairman of the War Work\r\nCommittee. At the annual convention of 1918 held at New Haven, she was\r\nre-elected. The year had been a peculiarly difficult one on account of\r\nthe absorption of many women in war work but the income was $30,085,\r\nof which $1,879 had been contributed for the oversea hospitals of the\r\nNational Suffrage Association. The work of the year had been directed\r\ntowards (1) the Federal Suffrage Amendment and the securing of a\r\nfavorable Connecticut delegation to Congress; (2) influencing the two\r\nmajor parties in the State to include suffrage planks in their\r\nplatforms; (3) securing the election of members of the Legislature who\r\nwould be favorable to ratification.\r\n\r\nAt the jubilee convention of 1919, held at Bridgeport after the\r\nFederal Amendment had been submitted in June, a new constitution was\r\nadopted, which provided for the election of five political leaders in\r\naddition to the other officers and an organization of the State by\r\ncounties and districts, looking towards the forming later of a League\r\nof Women Voters. During the year there had been a financial campaign,\r\nwhich was carried on under the direction of Mrs. Nancy Schoonmaker,\r\nresulting in gifts and pledges amounting to $30,993, of which $25,813\r\nwere paid at the time of the convention. The total income for the year\r\nwas $63,398. Miss Ludington was again elected and most of the other\r\nofficers remained on the board. After thorough discussion it was\r\nresolved that the policy of the association for 1919-20 should be to\r\noppose especially the small group of Republican politicians who had\r\nblocked and were persistently blocking the progress of woman\r\nsuffrage. This resolution pledged the association to a fight against\r\nthe Republican \"machine,\" which was made with intense determination.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. The final struggle came in 1920 over ratification of the\r\nFederal Suffrage Amendment. Great efforts had been made to obtain a\r\nmajority favorable to it in the Legislature that would meet in 1919\r\nand had Congress submitted it in time to be voted on at the regular\r\nsession it would doubtless have been ratified, as both parties knew it\r\nwas inevitable. It was not passed by Congress, however, until June 4,\r\nand by this time the Legislature had adjourned, not to meet again for\r\ntwo years unless called in special session. All that the suffragists\r\nwere able to do during the winter of 1919 was to press for a\r\nPresidential suffrage bill such as had been adopted by a number of\r\nStates. In support of this a petition signed by over 98,000\r\nwomen--increased afterwards to 102,000--was presented to the\r\nLegislature when the bill came up for consideration. Nevertheless,\r\nthrough the intense hostility of the Republican \"machine,\" the bill\r\nwas defeated by a single vote in the Senate after having received a\r\nlarge majority in the House.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress finally sent the amendment to the Legislatures most of\r\nthem had adjourned and would not meet again until 1921. If women were\r\nto vote in the general election of November, 1920, ratification would\r\nhave to be by special sessions. The suffragists of Connecticut were\r\ndetermined that it should be one of the States to hold an extra\r\nsession. Deputations from the State Association and the National\r\nWoman's Party waited upon Governor Holcomb in the summer of 1919 to\r\nask that he call one in order to ratify the amendment. He refused on\r\nthe ground of a constitutional limitation of the Governor's power. The\r\nState constitution provides that the Governor may convene the General\r\nAssembly \"on special emergencies\" and he held that no special\r\nemergency existed. The association then concentrated on the Republican\r\nState Central Committee and the other leaders whom they considered the\r\nchief opponents of suffrage. A petition signed by 478 prominent\r\nmembers of the Republican party was presented to the chairman of this\r\ncommittee on Feb. 11, 1920, by the Men's Ratification Committee--a\r\ncommittee friendly to woman suffrage and anxious for the ending of\r\nthe long struggle, which had been formed with Colonel Isaac M. Ullman\r\nchairman. No effect was produced by this petition nor by an interview\r\nwith John Henry Roraback, the State chairman, by Miss Ludington, in\r\nwhich he was urged to put Connecticut among the 36 States necessary\r\nfor ratification, in order that the women might be able to feel that\r\nsuffrage had been granted them by their own State.\r\n\r\nBy March 35 Legislatures had ratified and only a group of three or\r\nfour States held out any hope of the 36th and final ratification, of\r\nwhich Connecticut was one. Leading Republicans in and out of Congress\r\ntried to impress upon those in Connecticut that this was no longer a\r\nState but a national issue. At their State convention in March the\r\nResolutions Committee gave a hearing to the suffragists and reported a\r\nresolution in favor of a special session, which was passed by the\r\nconvention and presented to the Governor. It then returned to power\r\nthe very men who would prevent it. The Governor remained obdurate. To\r\nthe first petition he had replied that the desire of a few women did\r\nnot create an emergency. Then he had argued that suffrage was not an\r\nissue when the Legislature was elected and therefore the legislators\r\nwere not authorized by the voters to act upon it. A little later he\r\ngave it as his opinion that persistent appeals do not constitute an\r\nemergency. Finally on April 10, in reply to a letter from Colonel\r\nUllman, he stated that he was ready to receive proof of the existence\r\nof an emergency. The Connecticut women decided to give him the proof\r\nand the National Suffrage Association offered its cooperation by\r\nsending women from all over the country to Connecticut to join in a\r\ngreat protest against the blocking of woman suffrage for the whole\r\nnation. May 3-7, 1920, was declared \"emergency week\" and a Suffrage\r\nEmergency Corps was organized of 46 eminent women from as many States.\r\nThey assembled in New York the evening of Sunday, May 2, as dinner\r\nguests of Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, the national president, and\r\nreceived their \"marching orders and field instructions\" from her and\r\nMiss Ludington.\r\n\r\nThe Emergency Corps arrived in Hartford Monday morning and were guests\r\nat a luncheon given in their honor at the Golf Club, whose rooms were\r\ncrowded with men and women to meet these doctors, lawyers,\r\nprofessors, scientists, officials, business women, presidents of\r\norganizations--a remarkable gathering. There were roll call and\r\nspeeches and then they separated into four groups and departed by\r\nmotors for the four largest cities, where they spoke at mass meetings\r\nin the evening. A carefully planned tour was made of thirty-six towns\r\nwith a total of forty-one meetings, at which they were introduced and\r\nassisted by prominent men. Mrs. Catt spoke to a large audience in\r\nWoolsey Hall, New Haven, with Mayor Fitzgerald presiding. The object\r\nof the campaign was to show the sentiment in the State for a special\r\nsession of the Legislature and a resolution calling for it was\r\nenthusiastically adopted at each meeting.\r\n\r\nThe Governor appointed Friday morning at 11:30 for the interview and\r\nthe visitors and the officers and staff of the State Suffrage\r\nAssociation were at the Capitol. Every possible point bearing on the\r\ncase was brought out by the speakers and they pleaded with the\r\nGovernor to settle this question of ratification by a stroke of his\r\npen for the women of the whole nation. He said he would reserve his\r\ndecision till he had carefully considered their arguments, and they\r\nwent out to report to the mass meeting in progress on the grounds of\r\nthe Capitol. The following Tuesday he made public his answer, which\r\nwas that, while the arguments proved that there was a strong desire\r\nfor a special session, they did not prove the existence of the\r\n\"special emergency\" mentioned in the constitution and he felt\r\ncompelled to decline.\r\n\r\nA petition asking for a special session was then sent to the Governor\r\nsigned by a majority of both parties in both Houses of the\r\nLegislature, which had not the slightest effect. The State association\r\nheld a meeting and resolved to try to defeat those Republican\r\ncandidates who were opposed to ratification and especially the little\r\ngroup who composed the Republican \"machine.\" Miss Ludington issued a\r\nmanifesto giving in detail their action which had determined this\r\npolicy and saying:\r\n\r\n     Our fight now is \"November, 1920.\" One of the most important\r\n     presidential elections in years is to be held then. Women are\r\n     just as vitally affected by it and as deeply interested in it as\r\n     men. Although 35 out of the necessary 36 States have ratified, no\r\n     women can vote in this election under the Federal Amendment until\r\n     the 36th State has ratified. It is curious how slow the\r\n     public--women as well as men--have been to realize this. They\r\n     talk of our being \"almost\" voters. They do not seem to understand\r\n     that although Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, etc., have\r\n     ratified the amendment, the women of these States will not vote\r\n     until the 36th State ratifies. Who is responsible for the delay\r\n     which may keep over 10,000,000 women from the vote for President\r\n     and about 20,000,000 from the vote for members of Congress, State\r\n     officials, etc.? Both political parties but the Republican in\r\n     greater degree.... It lies in the power of this party to speak\r\n     the word that will fully enfranchise the women of this country\r\n     and where there is power there is responsibility.\r\n\r\n     \"But,\" the Republicans say, \"we have given you 29 States. Think\r\n     of that! You ought to be grateful to us.\" \"Exactly,\" we answer,\r\n     \"but you have withheld that one State which would make just the\r\n     difference between our voting or not voting. And by the way you\r\n     didn't 'give' us those 29 States--we had to work pretty hard to\r\n     get some of them!\" An emancipator is not the man who takes the\r\n     prisoner all the way to the door and lets him look out but the\r\n     man who actually unlocks the door and lets him go free. Once in\r\n     history the Republican party played the part of a genuine\r\n     emancipator. Now it looks very much as if it was playing petty\r\n     politics.... At the time of the last State Republican convention\r\n     the Hartford _Courant_ obligingly explained that the suffrage\r\n     resolution it passed was a pretense and really meant nothing--a\r\n     statement, it is only fair to say, repudiated by many honorable\r\n     Republicans. Now it is Chairman Roraback, who, with happy\r\n     unconsciousness that he is exhibiting his party in a \"yellow\"\r\n     light, tells the public that the national Republican platform\r\n     should not be taken seriously.... \"The leaders of the party,\" he\r\n     says, \"put in the suffrage plank to please women in the voting\r\n     States but they meant nothing by it.\" Are the men who are to lead\r\n     a great party as double-faced and untrustworthy as Mr. Roraback\r\n     paints them? Were they laughing in their sleeves as they wrote\r\n     the solemn pledges in the rest of the national platform? We\r\n     wonder if Connecticut Republicans will let Mr. Roraback smirch\r\n     the party honor unchallenged.\r\n\r\n     The course for the State Suffrage Association is clear. We must\r\n     play our part in this sector of the national suffrage struggle\r\n     and we must let our opponents see that they can not keep American\r\n     citizens out of their fundamental rights with impunity.\r\n\r\nA committee of Republican women circulated a pledge to give no money\r\nor work for the Republican party as long as women had no votes. Three\r\ninfluential Republican women travelled to Columbus, O., to put before\r\nthe Republican National Executive Committee the opinions of Republican\r\nwomen who were questioning the sincerity of the party in regard to\r\nwoman suffrage. In August thirty Connecticut women, headed by Miss\r\nLudington, went to New York by appointment to call upon Will Hays,\r\nchairman of the National Republican Committee, and ask him what the\r\nparty was doing to secure ratification in Connecticut. He received\r\nthem in the national headquarters and Miss Ludington, who spoke for\r\nthe deputation, reminded him that his party was taking the credit for\r\nthe ratification of the Federal Suffrage Amendment thus far but not\r\nbringing any effective pressure on the Republican Governors of\r\nConnecticut and Vermont, each of whom could insure its full success,\r\nand said: \"What the women want is the vote in November. What the\r\nparties apparently want is a good record as a talking point in the\r\ncoming campaign. What to the women is the supremely important thing is\r\nthat 36th State. What to the parties seems to be most important is to\r\nexact their full due of gratitude from women who have not as yet\r\nreceived the gift that was promised.... In our own State, where the\r\nRepublican party is responsible, the women are actually being called\r\nupon to aid its campaign while it is repudiating the policy and\r\npromises of the national party in regard to ratification.\"\r\n\r\nThe speaker then quoted the resolution adopted by the National\r\nRepublican Committee Dec. 10, 1919, calling for special sessions\r\nbefore February to complete ratification, accompanied by the public\r\nstatement: \"The party managers will cooperate with the women in a\r\ndetermined effort to bring about the calling of special sessions.\" She\r\nquoted the resolution passed by this committee June 1, 1920: \"Such\r\nRepublican States as have not already done so are urged to take such\r\naction by their Governors and legislators as will assure the\r\nratification at the earliest possible time.\" She then gave a part of\r\nthe plank in the national Republican platform adopted two months ago:\r\n\"We earnestly hope that Republican Legislatures which have not yet\r\nacted will ratify the 19th Amendment to the end that all women may\r\nparticipate in the election of 1920,\" and said: \"We have had no proof\r\nas yet that the party means to make good on these declared\r\nintentions--in fact many things seem to point the other way; first,\r\nthe Republican failure to ratify in Delaware; second, the weak plank\r\nin the Republican national platform, which was emasculated _at the\r\nrequest of the Connecticut delegates_ until it was an affront to the\r\nintelligence of women and a mockery of the Connecticut and Vermont\r\nLegislatures; third, the present situation in Connecticut.\r\n\r\n\"From the time when suffrage became an issue,\" Miss Ludington\r\ncontinued, \"it has had the opposition of the leaders of the Republican\r\nparty in this State. Since the amendment passed Congress they have\r\nresisted every expression of public opinion, every plea for\r\nratification on grounds of justice and fair play. For a year the\r\nsuffragists have tried sincerely and patiently to work in and with the\r\nRepublican party to overcome this opposition, and have been\r\ncooperating with a Republican Men's Ratification Committee formed for\r\nthis purpose, but we are apparently no nearer a special session than\r\nwe were a year ago.\" She then concluded:\r\n\r\n     During all this time we have had no evidence that the National\r\n     Republican Committee was really working in the State. We have\r\n     found it very difficult to reach you personally and our appeals\r\n     for specific help have been ignored. Mr. Roraback and Major John\r\n     Buckley, secretary to the Governor, have stated that he has never\r\n     been asked by you to call a session. They evidently feel, and\r\n     wish the public to understand, that the National Republican\r\n     Committee has given them a free hand to pursue their\r\n     obstructionist course. And to confirm this comes President-elect\r\n     Harding's refusal to attempt to persuade Governor Holcomb.\r\n\r\n     In the meantime, we women are being told that the Republican\r\n     party can not be held responsible, because the Governor stands\r\n     alone in his opposition! We submit that so long as the official\r\n     leaders of the party in the State are in entire harmony with him\r\n     in opposing us and the national party keeps hands off, they are\r\n     accomplices in his opposition and must be held responsible\r\n     accordingly. And we further submit that if a national party is to\r\n     come before the voters on the basis of its policies and promises,\r\n     then it must be held responsible for making those promises good\r\n     through its State branches.... If the Connecticut Republican\r\n     leaders can play a free hand without interference from the\r\n     national party, then that party faces the alternative of either\r\n     admitting powerlessness and disintegration or of being an\r\n     accomplice in the State's attitude of repudiation.\r\n\r\n     Connecticut women will remain voteless unless their State or\r\n     Vermont or a southern State ratifies. The Republican party can\r\n     help us in two ways--either by giving a solid Republican vote in\r\n     Tennessee or by putting forth a really vigorous effort in a New\r\n     England State.\r\n\r\nThe situation in Connecticut remained unchanged but about two weeks\r\nafter this interview the Tennessee Legislature ratified by means of\r\nboth Republican and Democratic votes. This made the 36th State and\r\nSecretary Colby proclaimed the Federal Suffrage Amendment a part of\r\nthe National Constitution. The Democrats were claiming the credit and\r\nthe general election was only two months away. The Republicans,\r\nespecially those in Connecticut, keenly felt the situation. Governor\r\nHolcomb was obliged to call a special session to enact legislation for\r\nregistering the women. The Legislature was called to meet September 14\r\nand the Governor warned it that it must restrict itself to the\r\nbusiness outlined in the call. No such restriction had ever before\r\nbeen laid upon a Connecticut Legislature and the Governor himself two\r\nyears before had urged that he was powerless to prevent it from\r\nenacting any bills that it pleased when once it had been called in\r\nspecial session. The members of House and Senate were almost unanimous\r\nin resenting this attempt to fetter their action and plans were laid\r\nto ratify the Federal Amendment.\r\n\r\nBefore September 14, however, developments in regard to the Tennessee\r\nratification seemed to threaten its validity and Governor Holcomb and\r\nthe Republican leaders perceived that there was an emergency which\r\ncalled for ratification by Connecticut to prevent difficulty in the\r\ncoming elections. This was especially apparent to U. S. Senator Frank\r\nB. Brandegee, who had been an uncompromising opponent of the Federal\r\nSuffrage Amendment and voted against it every time it came before the\r\nSenate. He sent an urgent letter to Colonel Ullman, chairman of the\r\nMen's Ratification League, in which he said: \"In view of the fact that\r\nthe validity of the ratification of the amendment by the State of\r\nTennessee has been questioned and that the result of the entire\r\nelection throughout the country may be imperilled thereby, and in\r\nconsideration of the fact that the amendment is certain to be ratified\r\nby more than the required number of States as soon as their\r\nLegislatures assemble in 1921, I earnestly hope that the Legislature\r\nof Connecticut will ratify it.\"[24]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the special session opened Governor Holcomb went before it\r\nand asked it to adjourn without action, as he intended to issue\r\nanother call for it to meet a week hence to ratify the amendment as\r\nwell as to enact the necessary legislation. Both House and Senate\r\nrefused to accede to his request but by unanimous vote in the Senate\r\nand by a vote of 216 to 11 in the House, the Federal Suffrage\r\nAmendment was ratified, although the Governor had not submitted the\r\ncertified copy to them.[25] After passing a number of other bills, all\r\nof which were outside of the limits set by the Governor, the\r\nLegislature adjourned to September 21, when the second session had\r\nbeen called.\r\n\r\nWhen the Legislature met on September 21 the Governor appeared before\r\nthe two Houses and asked them to ratify the amendment which he now\r\nlaid before them. Many of the members were unwilling to do this, as it\r\nseemed a confession that their former action was invalid. Wiser\r\ncounsels prevailed, especially as Miss Ludington and the State Board\r\nstrongly urged them not to allow their scruples to stand in the way\r\nwhen there might be a possible doubt as to whether the first\r\nratification was legal. The amendment was again ratified, by the\r\nSenate unanimously, the House 194 to 9. Later in the day a motion was\r\nmade to reconsider and confirm the action of the first session. This\r\nwas done to satisfy the members who were determined that the first\r\nrecord should stand as authentic. Thus after a struggle lasting over\r\nfifteen months, the Legislature at its first opportunity ratified the\r\nFederal Suffrage Amendment, once, twice and thrice, and if there was\r\nany doubt about Tennessee there was none whatever about Connecticut.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe long fight for ratification and the contest against Senator\r\nBrandegee made it impossible to organize a League of Women Voters in\r\n1920. On November 8 and 9, after the election was over, the\r\nConnecticut Woman Suffrage Association held its last convention in\r\nHartford. It voted to keep the organization in existence for a couple\r\nof months until a league could be formed and then, without further\r\nceremony, to dissolve. Preliminary organization work was continued and\r\non Jan. 18, 1921, at a convention in New Haven the League of Women\r\nVoters came into existence with Miss Mabel C. Washburn chairman.[26]\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. The Connecticut Legislature has only a melancholy\r\nrecord of defeats, having given the women nothing except a vote for\r\nschool trustees and on some school questions in 1893.\r\n\r\n1901. A bill for Municipal suffrage was adversely reported from\r\ncommittee and defeated.\r\n\r\n1903. The same bill was defeated in the House on roll call by 105\r\nnoes, 40 ayes; in the Senate without roll call.\r\n\r\n1905. The same measure had a favorable report from the Joint Woman\r\nSuffrage Committee but it was not accepted by House or Senate.\r\n\r\n1907. In addition to the Municipal suffrage bill the association\r\npresented one for Presidential suffrage. The Senate rejected both\r\nwithout a roll call; House vote on Municipal suffrage, noes, 86; ayes,\r\n56; on Presidential, noes 93; ayes, 55.\r\n\r\n1909. For the usual bill the Legislature substituted one giving women\r\na vote on levying a tax for maintaining a public library, which passed\r\nthe Senate without roll call and the House by 82 ayes, 50 noes. It\r\nnever was put into operation.\r\n\r\n1911. The two usual bills received unanimous favorable reports from\r\ncommittees. The Municipal passed the Senate but was defeated in the\r\nHouse, both without roll call. A resolution to submit an amendment was\r\ndefeated in the House, not voted on in the Senate.\r\n\r\n1913. State constitutional amendment defeated in the Senate by 20\r\nnoes, 9 ayes, and in the House without roll call.\r\n\r\n1915. The above action was repeated except that both Houses defeated\r\nwithout a roll call.\r\n\r\n1917. Three measures were introduced--a bill for Presidential and\r\nMunicipal suffrage, a bill giving women a vote in local option\r\nelections and the amendment resolution. The two bills were fought with\r\ngreat determination. The first was defeated in the Senate by 19 noes,\r\n13 ayes; in the House by 149 noes, 85 ayes. The Excise bill was tabled\r\nin the Senate, rejected in the House by 139 noes, 69 ayes. The\r\nresolution passed the House by 138 ayes, 96 noes and was referred to\r\nthe next Legislature for final action, as required by law.\r\n\r\n1919. The State constitutional amendment came automatically before the\r\nLegislature but a legal opinion given by former Governor Baldwin held\r\nthat it would sweep away the literacy test for voters and the suffrage\r\nleaders, who doubted the wisdom of going to the work and expense of a\r\nreferendum campaign when the Federal Amendment was so near, were glad\r\nto have so good a reason for not pressing the matter. The Presidential\r\nsuffrage bill secured a majority favorable report from the Joint Woman\r\nSuffrage Committee and it passed in the House by a majority of 27. In\r\nthe Senate the Republican \"machine\" was determined to defeat it. In\r\nthe first vote there was a majority of two against it but on\r\nreconsideration there was only one. The \"machine\" only defeated it by\r\nwinning a few Democratic votes. The fight over this measure had been\r\nmade with skill and courage by the women against the most determined\r\nopposition on the part of the Republican \"machine,\" which since 1900\r\nhad completely controlled both Houses.\r\n\r\nThe chairman of the Republican State Central Committee, John Henry\r\nRoraback, and Major John Buckley, secretary to the Governor, were\r\naccounted by the women their most bitter enemies and Speaker of the\r\nHouse James F. Walsh used his large powers to defeat the suffrage\r\nbills. Of the fifteen important House committees anti-suffragists held\r\neleven of the chairmanships. The chairman of the Woman Suffrage\r\nCommittee, Admiral William S. Cowles, was an \"anti\" but in spite of\r\nhis influence the committee report was favorable. This was due to the\r\nprogress of public sentiment, accelerated by the work of women during\r\nthe war and to the organization for suffrage which had been going\r\nforward. Of the more progressive group of Republicans in the\r\nLegislature who fought for suffrage may be mentioned Lieutenant\r\nGovernor Clifford Wilson, Senators John B. Dillon, Charles E.\r\nWilliamson, William H. Heald, Arthur E. Bowers and Representative\r\nHarry R. Sherwood. Senator Charles C. Hemenway, Democratic leader and\r\neditor of the Hartford _Times_, was one of its most valuable\r\nsupporters.\r\n\r\nThe liquor forces always employed lobbyists against the suffrage bills\r\nand fought the movement secretly and openly. There were a number of\r\nprominent women opposed but they were not organized until aroused by\r\nthe activity that followed the election of Mrs. Hepburn as president\r\nin 1910. The State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage was then\r\nformed with Mrs. Daniel Markham as president and she held the office\r\nuntil the proclamation of the Federal Suffrage Amendment put an end to\r\nher organization. It held occasional meetings with speakers from\r\noutside the State. The members attended legislative hearings and at\r\nthe large one on the Municipal and Excise bills in 1917 they occupied\r\nthe right of the chamber with row on row of the liquor men back of\r\nthem wearing the red rose which was their emblem.\r\n\r\nAs the Democrats constituted a minority party it was always easier to\r\nsecure from them expressions favorable to woman suffrage and in 1916\r\nand 1918 such planks were placed in their platform. In 1918 they\r\ndeclared for the Federal Suffrage Amendment and a majority of those\r\nelected pledged themselves to vote for ratification, if it came before\r\nthe Legislature, and did vote for the Presidential suffrage bill. The\r\nwomen went to the Republicans conventions each year to ask for a\r\nsuffrage plank but were steadily unsuccessful. In 1916 the State\r\nplatform reaffirmed the national one, which declared in favor of woman\r\nsuffrage. In 1918 the Republican platform included a plank approving\r\nthe principle of woman suffrage but leaving it to the States for\r\naction and not to a Federal Amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[22] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Annie G.\r\nPorritt, journalist, author and lecturer, officially connected with\r\nthe Connecticut Woman Suffrage Association from 1910 as corresponding,\r\nrecording and press secretary.\r\n\r\n[23] In June, 1915, a branch of the Congressional Union (later the\r\nNational Woman's Party), was organized with Mrs. William D. Ascough as\r\nchairman. At that time the Woman Suffrage Association was giving its\r\nattention almost exclusively to State work and the new organization\r\nbegan by sending deputations to each of the Congressmen and Senators\r\nto ask support for the Federal Suffrage Amendment. Meetings and a\r\npress service to promote the amendment were carried on until\r\nratification was completed. Connecticut members took part in every\r\nnational demonstration of the Union and eleven suffered terms of\r\nimprisonment. Annual conventions were held each year and in 1918 Mrs.\r\nThomas N. Hepburn was elected chairman, Mrs. Ascough having removed\r\nfrom the State. The Union raised money for the ratification campaigns\r\nin New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, West Virginia, Delaware and\r\nTennessee and sent workers to assist them and also to secure a special\r\nsession in Vermont.\r\n\r\n[24] Notwithstanding this letter the State Suffrage Association used\r\nits whole strength against Senator Brandegee's election on November 2.\r\nIt was estimated that 90 per cent. of the women voted. Although the\r\nbig Republican landslide elected him he received 12,446 fewer votes\r\nthan the Republican candidate for President.\r\n\r\n[25] A certified copy of this vote was immediately dispatched to\r\nWashington by Miss Flanagan, one of the National Woman's Party\r\nworkers, and Secretary of State Colby accepted it as valid. It is\r\ntherefore on record in Washington that Connecticut ratified the\r\nFederal Suffrage Amendment on September 14, 1920.\r\n\r\n[26] The officers of the State Association from 1901 to 1920,\r\nbesides the presidents, not already mentioned, were as follows:\r\nVice-presidents, Mrs. Annie C. S. Fenner, 1906-1910; corresponding and\r\nrecording secretaries, Mrs. Ella B. Kendrick, Mrs. Marcia West, Mrs.\r\nJessie Adler, Mrs. Annie G. Porritt, Miss Mabel C. Washburn, Mrs.\r\nFrederick C. Spencer, Mrs. Hiram P. Maxim, Mrs. William H. Deming,\r\nMrs. Samuel T. Davis, Jr., Mrs. S. H. Benton, Mrs. William C. Cheney.\r\n\r\nAmong those who served in other official capacities were Mesdames E.\r\nJ. Warren, Cynthia B. Fuller, Henrietta J. Pinches, A. Barton Hepburn,\r\nJulius Maltby, H. H. DeLoss, Carlos F. Stoddard, Henry Townshend,\r\nJonathan A. Rawson, T. S. McDermott, Ruth McIntire Dadourian; Misses\r\nEmily Whitney, Mary A. Goodman, Mary Bulkley, Frances Osborn.\r\n\r\nThe names of the many women who gave devoted service to this cause\r\nduring this score of years can never be recorded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nDELAWARE.[27]\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the past twenty years the advocates of woman suffrage have\r\ncontinued to suffer from the handicap peculiar to Delaware--no\r\nreferendum to the voters possible on constitutional amendments--and\r\ntherefore it never has had the advantage of a State-wide educational\r\ncampaign. An amendment must be passed by two-thirds of each branch of\r\nthe Legislature at two successive sessions and it then becomes a part\r\nof the constitution. However, the State Equal Suffrage Association has\r\nheld conventions every year. Many distinguished advocates from outside\r\nthe State, including Miss Susan B. Anthony, Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, Mrs.\r\nCarrie Chapman Catt, Miss Mary Garrett Hay, Mrs. Beatrice Forbes\r\nRobertson Hale, Mrs. Maud Wood Park, Mrs. Frank A. Vanderlip and Mrs.\r\nBorden Harriman, have been among the speakers. Prominent endorsers of\r\nwoman suffrage have been the State Grange, Grand Army of the Republic,\r\nMinisterial Union, Central Labor Union and Woman's Christian\r\nTemperance Union. The last is the only leading woman's organization to\r\ngive official sanction.\r\n\r\nThe annual State convention was held Nov. 6, 1901, at Newport, with\r\nthree clubs--Wilmington, Newport and New Castle--under the presidency\r\nof Mrs. Martha S. Cranston. Dr. Shaw, vice-president-at-large of the\r\nNational Association, was the speaker and the presence of reporters\r\nwas an encouraging feature.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1902 took place November 8 in Wilmington. Miss Jane\r\nCampbell, president of the large Philadelphia county society, and\r\nHenry W. Wilbur of the Friends' society, New York, were the speakers\r\nfrom outside the State. During this year the W. C. T. U. and the\r\nWilmington District Epworth League passed suffrage resolutions. The\r\nLife and Work of Susan B. Anthony was placed in travelling libraries.\r\nWomen were urged to pay their taxes \"under protest.\" The Newport Club\r\npetitioned that the word \"male\" be omitted from the new town charter\r\nbut without success. Governor John Hunn in his Message to the\r\nLegislature said: \"The time is coming when the participation of women\r\nin all our civil affairs will be voluntarily sought as an infusion of\r\nindispensable new elements into our citizenship.\"\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1903 was held November 28 at Newport, with Miss\r\nHarriet May Mills of New York as the chief speaker. The master of the\r\nState Grange declared his belief this year in the equality of the\r\nsexes and urged that some provisions be made for the higher education\r\nof Delaware women. The convention of 1904 was held November 22 in\r\nWilmington with an address by Dr. Shaw and $25 were pledged to the\r\nNational Association. In 1905 the convention was held November 4 in\r\nNew Castle, with Dr. Shaw the speaker. A pledge of $25 was again made\r\nto the National Association and Delaware's quota to the Oregon\r\ncampaign was subscribed. The State convention took place at Newport on\r\nNov. 6, 1906. This year the G. A. R. endorsed both State and national\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\nThe convention held Oct. 2, 1907, in Wilmington, arranged to send the\r\nState president to the congressional suffrage hearing at Washington.\r\nThe outside speaker was Mrs. Susan S. Fessenden of Massachusetts. A\r\nchairman of church work was appointed. Reports showed that much\r\nsuffrage sentiment was now manifested in the State.\r\n\r\nThe convention of Nov. 12, 1908, at Newport, was addressed by Mrs.\r\nRachel Foster Avery and Miss Lucy E. Anthony, the latter describing\r\nthe great suffrage parade in London in which she had taken part. A\r\nmemorial to David Ferris, a prominent friend of woman suffrage, was\r\nread by Miss Emma Worrell. The Higher Education of the Young Women of\r\nDelaware was discussed by Professor H. H. Hayward, dean of Agriculture\r\nin Delaware College.\r\n\r\nThe convention of Nov. 29, 1909, in Wilmington, was addressed by Miss\r\nCampbell and Miss Mary Winsor of Haverford, Penn. Memorials to Henry\r\nB. Blackwell and William Lloyd Garrison were read by Mrs. Gertrude W.\r\nNields. The national petition work for a Federal Amendment was\r\nundertaken in Wilmington with Miss Mary R. de Vou and Mrs. Don P.\r\nJones in charge; in the rest of the State by Mrs. Cranston.\r\nLegislators and the State at large were deluged with literature. Miss\r\nPerle Penfield, a national organizer, was sent for one week by\r\ncourtesy of Mrs. Avery, president of the Pennsylvania association. A\r\nhearing was arranged by Professor Hayward before a Senate committee in\r\nthe interest of the higher education of women in Delaware, without\r\nresult.[28] A telegram and a letter were sent by the State president\r\nand corresponding secretary to President Theodore Roosevelt, asking\r\nhim to remember woman suffrage in his message to Congress.\r\n\r\nThe annual convention held Nov. 10, 1910, in Wilmington, was addressed\r\nby Miss Lida Stokes Adams of Philadelphia and Frank Stephens of the\r\nArden Colony near by. A fine tribute to Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, who had\r\nrecently passed away, was given by Miss Worrell. The Newport and other\r\nclubs sent $30 for the Susan B. Anthony Memorial Fund and a\r\ncontribution was made to the South Dakota campaign.\r\n\r\nIn March the society of Wilmington, the largest branch, began holding\r\nmonthly meetings. In response to a letter from the National\r\nAssociation, Miss Mary H. Askew Mather, Miss de Vou and Miss Emma Lore\r\nwere appointed to investigate the laws of Delaware affecting the\r\nstatus of women in regard to their property rights and the\r\nguardianship of their children. A committee was appointed to support\r\nthe candidacy of Dr. Josephine M. R. White deLacour for membership on\r\nthe school board of Wilmington, where women had school suffrage. This\r\nyear woman suffrage in Delaware lost another friend by the death of\r\nformer Chief Justice Charles B. Lore, who framed the petition to the\r\nState constitutional convention in 1897 and who stood unfailingly for\r\nthe equality of men and women before the law. The State convention met\r\nNov. 9, 1911, at Newport.\r\n\r\nAt the State convention held Nov. 20, 1912, in Wilmington, addresses\r\nwere made by Mrs. Harriet Taylor Upton, State president of Ohio, and\r\nMiss Harriet May Mills State president of New York; and on the subject\r\nWhy Delaware Needs a College for Women by Mrs. Emalea P. Warner and\r\nDr. Hayward. It was decided to have a bill presented to the\r\nLegislature of 1913 for striking the word \"male\" from the constitution\r\nof the State. A branch club had been formed at the Arden Single Tax\r\nColony. The State association had held 22 meetings.\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 4, 1913, a delegation from the Wilmington club was granted a\r\nhearing before the Charter Commission and asked for a clause in the\r\nproposed new city charter giving Municipal suffrage to women. Nine of\r\nthe ten commissioners were present and arguments were presented by\r\nMiss Worrell, Mrs. Margaret H. Kent, Mrs. Cranston, Arthur R. Spaid,\r\ncounty superintendent of schools; George B. Miller, president of the\r\nboard of education; Miss Grace B. Tounsend and Miss de Vou. This was\r\nrefused and the charter was defeated by an overwhelming majority with\r\nno suffrage clause to handicap it. In February the club held a large\r\npublic meeting at the New Century Club with the Rev. Dr. George Edward\r\nReed, former president of Dickinson College, as the speaker. The club\r\norganized a municipal section to study the work of the city boards and\r\nto offer assistance in forwarding civic improvement, which was\r\naddressed by the Mayor and heads of departments. The State association\r\nwas represented in the great suffrage parade in New York City on May 4\r\nby Mrs. J. R. Milligan and Miss Tounsend.\r\n\r\nAt the State convention in Wilmington Nov. 6, 1913, fraternal\r\ndelegates were present from the W. C. T. U., Consumers' League and\r\nJuvenile Court Association. Addresses were made by Irving Warner, Mrs.\r\nMary Ware Dennett, corresponding secretary of the National\r\nAssociation, and Miss Mabel Vernon, of the Congressional Union. The\r\nmusic was generously furnished as usual by the treasurer, Miss Lore.\r\nThere were now 174 dues-paying members and 560 registered\r\nsympathizers; 12 executive sessions had been held and 35 meetings, 18\r\noutdoors, and 10,000 fliers and leaflets distributed. On February\r\n18-20, the association was sponsor for \"General\" Rosalie Jones and her\r\nPilgrim Band en route from New York to Washington, D. C. Mayor Howell\r\nof Wilmington welcomed them in the City Hall and they were guests at\r\nthe Garrick Theater, where they spoke between acts to an overcrowded\r\nhouse. The State association was well represented in the famous parade\r\nin Washington, D. C., on March 3, and again on April 7 when 531 women\r\nfrom various States marched to the Capitol bearing special messages to\r\nmembers of Congress, urging their support of the Federal Amendment. A\r\ntent was established at the State Fair in September, realizing a long\r\ncherished desire of the president, with Miss Ella W. Johnson in\r\ncharge. The two organizations joined forces and opened headquarters in\r\nWilmington, from which petitions to Congress were circulated and much\r\nliterature sent out.\r\n\r\nThe annual convention was held Oct. 30, 1914, at Dover, the State\r\ncapital but with no suffrage club. Secretary of State James H. Hughes\r\nwelcomed the convention for vice-Mayor McGee, who refused to do so.\r\nThe speakers were Mrs. Helen Hoy Greeley of New York, Samuel H. Derby\r\nof Kent county and Mrs. Florence Bayard Hilles, Delaware chairman of\r\nthe Congressional Union. In Wilmington a meeting was held February 15\r\nin honor of Miss Anthony's birthday, with Miss Anna Maxwell Jones of\r\nNew York as the speaker. In April on Arbor Day a \"suffrage oak\" was\r\nplanted, Mayor Howell presiding. In May a successful parade, the\r\nfirst, was given in Wilmington with Mrs. Hilles in command. In\r\nSeptember both political State conventions were asked to endorse woman\r\nsuffrage but refused. Two rooms were furnished by and named in honor\r\nof the State association, one at the Industrial School for Girls in\r\nClaymont and one at the College for Women in Newark. It again had a\r\ntent at the State Fair; prizes were given in the schools for the best\r\nessays on woman suffrage; Lucy Stone's birthday was honored in August\r\n13; members were enrolled by the hundreds and fifteen executive\r\nmeetings were held. The City Council's invitation was accepted to\r\nmarch in the Old Home Week parade.\r\n\r\nThe convention for 1915 took place on November 11, in Wilmington, with\r\nspeakers, Dr. Shaw, Miss Worrell on Elizabeth Cady Stanton's 100th\r\nBirthday; Miss Ethel Smith of Washington, D. C., on National Work.\r\nMrs. Cranston, \"the Susan B. Anthony of Delaware,\" the association's\r\nfirst and only president since January, 1896, retired and was made\r\nhonorary president. Mrs. Mary Clare Brassington was elected her\r\nsuccessor. This year connection was severed with the Congressional\r\nUnion, which unexpectedly announced its purpose of forming another\r\nState society, while the old association continued its affiliation\r\nwith the National American. Three mass meetings were held with Miss\r\nJanet Richards, Mrs. Beatrice Forbes Robertson Hale and Mrs. Bayard\r\nHilles the speakers. The association was represented in May in the\r\nparade of the Woman Suffrage Party in Philadelphia, under the auspices\r\nof the National Association.\r\n\r\nThe annual convention met Nov. 10, 1916, in Wilmington, with Chas. A.\r\nWagner, State Commissioner of Education; Chas. W. Bush and Dr. Shaw as\r\nspeakers. Mrs. Brassington had been appointed to take part in the\r\nsuffrage demonstrations at the Republican and Democratic national\r\nconventions in Chicago and St. Louis. The State Central Committees\r\nwere again petitioned in vain for an endorsement of woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nAt the State convention held in Newport, Nov. 22, 1917, a $500 pledge\r\nwas made to the National Association. A telegram of congratulation had\r\nbeen sent to Governor John G. Townsend, Jr., upon the declaration for\r\nwoman suffrage in his inaugural address. Miss Lola Trax, a national\r\norganizer, was in the State five weeks, forming centers, and many\r\nmeetings were held. Federal Amendment Day was observed by tableaux on\r\nthe Court House steps in Wilmington, with Mrs. Florence Updegraff,\r\nnational organizer, and Miss Ospina, local congressional chairman, in\r\ncharge, Mrs. Brassington presiding, to whom a farewell luncheon was\r\ngiven, as she was removing from the State. She was succeeded by Miss\r\nAgnes Y. Downey, first vice-president.\r\n\r\nThe annual convention in Wilmington Nov. 29, 1918, was addressed by\r\nMrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, president and Mrs. Halsey W. Wilson,\r\nrecording secretary of the National Association. Mrs. Albert Robin was\r\nelected president. In May a congressional petition campaign was\r\nlaunched at a large subscription luncheon given in Hotel DuPont,\r\nWilmington, with Mrs. Catt, Mrs. Frank Vanderlip, Mrs. Maud Wood Park\r\nand Mrs. J. Borden Harriman guests of honor and speakers. Mrs. J.\r\nFrank Ball, State vice-president, presided. Miss Mabel Willard,\r\nacting for the National Association, conducted the petition \"drive\"\r\nand secured 175 volunteer workers, who enrolled 11,118 names to\r\ninfluence the votes of Delaware's U. S. Senators on the Federal\r\nAmendment. Mrs. Robin being absent from the State, Mrs. Ball became\r\nacting president. A conference with U. S. Senator Josiah O. Wolcott\r\nwas held at her home in June, a large number of prominent persons\r\nbeing present, at which the Senator declared himself open to\r\nconviction. Mrs. Halsey Wilson gave a week in September to work in the\r\nState. An active educational campaign was carried on until the\r\nNovember elections and suffrage literature was distributed at the\r\npolls.\r\n\r\nThe State convention took place in November, 1919, at Dover, with Mrs.\r\nRaymond Brown, national vice-president, as the principal speaker. A\r\nmemorial address for Dr. Anna Howard Shaw was presented by Mrs.\r\nCranston. At the reception given in the State House by Governor\r\nTownsend and Secretary of State Everett C. Johnson the Governor said\r\nin his welcome: \"I feel more than ever since the war that women should\r\nhave the ballot. I will be glad at any time to use my influence toward\r\ngiving those of Delaware the right of suffrage.\" A luncheon followed\r\nat the Hotel Richardson, attended by the Governor, Secretary of State\r\nand other officials. All of the legislators were invited. The guests\r\nwere welcomed by Mrs. Roswell P. Hammond, president of the Dover\r\nsociety, and James H. Hughes. Mrs. Robin, who presided, spoke of\r\nratification as the one goal of their efforts and Secretary Johnson\r\nendorsed it. The Opera House was crowded in the evening to hear the\r\naddress of Mrs. Brown.\r\n\r\nReports showed that in January the National Association sent an\r\norganizer, Mrs. Maria McMahon, and with the financial assistance of\r\nthe Wilmington society she opened headquarters in Dover, organized a\r\nnumber of towns and won many friends for the cause. Later Mrs. Halsey\r\nWilson gave another week to the State. About 600 telegrams were sent\r\nin February to the Delaware Senators urging them to vote for the\r\nsubmission of the Federal Suffrage Amendment but Senator Wolcott and\r\nSenator Willard Saulsbury both voted \"no\" on February 10, when it went\r\nto defeat. In May Mrs. Robin circularized the Delaware representatives\r\nin Congress and on the 21st, when the amendment was passed by the\r\nLower House, Caleb R. Layton, Delaware's one member, voted \"aye.\" In\r\nthe Senate, the newly elected Senator, L. Heisler Ball, was paired in\r\nfavor, Senator Wolcott again voting \"no.\" At a meeting of the State\r\nBoard a resolution was passed rejoicing over the success and calling\r\nfor a special session of the Legislature to ratify the amendment. A\r\nRatification Committee was appointed with Mrs. Robin chairman for\r\nWilmington and the State; Mrs. Cranston for rural New Castle county;\r\nMrs. Henry Ridgely for Kent county; Mrs. Robert G. Houston for Sussex\r\ncounty; Miss Leah Burton, legislative chairman; Miss deVou, press\r\nchairman and Mrs. Brassington chairman of literature. Mrs. Ridgely of\r\nDover was elected president and activities for the campaign were soon\r\ncentralized.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION.[29] When it became evident that the Federal Suffrage\r\nAmendment would be submitted by the next Congress, the presidents of\r\nState associations began to plan for ratification and many asked help\r\nfrom the National American Association. In response to a request from\r\nthe president of Delaware Mrs. McMahon was sent, arriving the last of\r\nJune, 1919, and beginning an active campaign of organization. T.\r\nColeman du Pont placed a motor at the disposal of the suffragists and\r\nin a few weeks Newcastle county had been covered with the assistance\r\nof Miss Downey and Mrs. J. W. Pennewell. Working out from Rehoboth\r\nwith the assistance of Mrs. Robin, Mrs. Ridgely, Mrs. Houston, Mrs.\r\nJohn Eskridge and others, Sussex county was organized and later Kent\r\nwith the help of Mrs. James H. Hughes, Mrs. Roswell Hammond, Mrs. Emma\r\nBurnett, Miss Winifred Morris and others. The interviewing of\r\ninfluential men was carried on with the organizing through the autumn.\r\n\r\nHeadquarters were opened in Dover in January, 1920, and effort from\r\nthat time was for a special session. Resolutions endorsing\r\nratification were secured from State and local Granges, from the State\r\nFederation of Women's Clubs, State Methodist convention, State\r\nFederation of Labor, State committees of Republican and Democratic\r\nparties, and the Wilmington City Republican Committee, the largest in\r\nthe State. No opposition was expressed by any organization. Each of\r\nthe fifty-two legislators was interviewed either by Miss Leah Burton,\r\nMrs. Ridgely or members of the Legislative Committee, Mrs. Harmon\r\nReynolds, Mrs. Cummins Speakman, Mrs. Hughes or Miss Morris, and by\r\nMrs. McMahon. Assurances were given by the majority in both parties\r\nthat their votes would be cast in favor of ratification. Governor\r\nTownsend and Secretary Johnson were constantly helpful. The Republican\r\nNational Committee, through its chairman, Will Hays, and the\r\nCongressional Committee, through its chairman, Simeon D. Fess,\r\nrendered every possible assistance and the latter sent a\r\nrepresentative to work in Dover. On January 15 a delegation headed by\r\nMrs. George Bass, chairman of the Woman's Division of the National\r\nDemocratic Committee, appealed to this committee to take some action\r\ntoward ratification and it gave its endorsement. Mr. Isaacs, chairman\r\nof the State Democratic Committee, asked the women to appear before it\r\nand on January 22, after an address by Mrs. Ridgely and full\r\ndiscussion, it endorsed ratification. The Republican State Committee\r\nendorsed it after Governor Townsend had called the special session for\r\nMarch 22. Only one Legislature was now needed to give the 36th and\r\nfinal ratification.\r\n\r\nAll looked so favorable that the women were little prepared for the\r\nweeks of intrigue and double dealing into which they were thrust\r\nimmediately upon the convening of the Legislature. Personal and\r\nfactional fights entered into the question, while the School Code\r\nplayed a prominent part and complicated the situation. It was briefly\r\nthis. A very large sum had been offered to the State by Pierre du Pont\r\nfor the much needed extension of Delaware's public school facilities\r\ncontingent upon the raising of a like sum by the State. The gift was\r\naccepted by the Legislature and the people must raise the State's\r\nshare of the fund. This meant taxes and taxes meant opposition. Those\r\nwho wanted the School Code repealed or modified were inclined to try\r\nto make terms on the suffrage measure. The men of Sussex, the most\r\nsouthern county, were particularly hostile and at a meeting in\r\nGeorgetown hundreds of them protested not only against the School Code\r\nbut also against prohibition and woman suffrage. It was the\r\nrepresentatives of these men who eventually blocked ratification in\r\nthe House and it was their two leaders, Daniel Layton, chairman of the\r\nState Central Committee, and former Governor Simeon S. Pennewell,\r\nwhose influence caused much of the opposition. Governor Townsend, who\r\naimed to raise Delaware from thirty-second place in educational ranks\r\nby the new code had aroused the personal antagonism of some of the\r\nleaders, but when it became apparent that Delaware was vitally needed\r\nto complete ratification he laid aside his fears that the code would\r\nbe repealed and called a special session.\r\n\r\nSuffrage mass meetings were held in all parts of the State and the\r\nweek before the Legislature met Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, addressed\r\nlarge audiences in Wilmington and Dover. The Ratification Committee\r\nappealed for more help and Miss Marjorie Shuler, national director of\r\nfield publicity, was sent and later Miss Betsy Edwards for political\r\nwork. When the special session opened not one of the three daily\r\npapers was supporting ratification, public meetings were being held by\r\nthe \"antis,\" their publicity was being sent broadcast to the\r\nmetropolitan press of the country and the impression was created that\r\nthe whole State was opposed to ratifying. To counteract this situation\r\nrequired weeks of hard work by the suffragists. Outside correspondents\r\nwere secured who would send out the true story of the political\r\nintrigue underlying the failure to ratify. The Wilmington _Morning\r\nNews_, under the ownership of Alfred I. du Pont, came out for\r\nratification and made a strong fight for it to the end.\r\n\r\nIn his message to the two Houses in joint session the Governor said:\r\n\"Woman suffrage has been a subject of public discussion for over half\r\na century. It is not an agitation of the moment, it is a world wide\r\nquestion of right and wrong. Your supreme duty is to think and act for\r\nthe good of your State and nation.\" Separate resolutions were\r\nintroduced in Senate and House, the former by a Republican, John M.\r\nWalker of Hockessin, the latter by Walter E. Hart, Democrat, of\r\nTownsend, the only one of eleven Democrats in the House who favored\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOn March 25 there was a hearing before the General Assembly. The\r\nopponents had rushed into town every farmer and small politician they\r\ncould secure and the women \"antis\" pinned a red rose in his\r\nbuttonhole. The suffragists had given a yellow jonquil to every\r\nfriend. Behind the Speaker's desk hung a huge yellow banner inscribed\r\n\"Votes for Women,\" and so crowded was the room with determined men and\r\neager women that the sergeant-at-arms had to clear a space for the\r\nSenate. The suffragists had two hours in the morning and the \"antis\"\r\nthe same amount of time in the afternoon, with thirty minutes each for\r\nrebuttal. Mrs. Catt, at the earnest request of the State association,\r\nspoke at this hearing, and its president, Mrs. Ridgely; also Mrs.\r\nFlorence Bayard Hilles, president of the Delaware branch of the\r\nNational Woman's Party (Congressional Union), United States Senators\r\nMcKellar of Tennessee and Stirling of South Dakota came from\r\nWashington to urge ratification. People crowded into Dover from over\r\nthe State and hot arguments took place in hotel lobbies and on the\r\nstreets. The State anti-suffrage association was represented by Miss\r\nCharlotte Rowe of Yonkers, N. Y., employed by their national\r\norganization. Mrs. Catt closed the argument and her speech was\r\nconsidered by the hundreds who heard it, according to the staff\r\ncorrespondent of the Wilmington _Evening Journal_, \"one of the\r\nclearest, strongest and most reasonable arguments for votes for women\r\never heard in Delaware.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this time until the vote was taken telegrams from outside the\r\nState urging ratification were poured into the Legislature. They came\r\nfrom the President of the United States; from Attorney General Palmer\r\nand Secretaries Daniels, Houston and Meredith of his Cabinet; from\r\nRepublican Governors, State chairmen and party leaders throughout the\r\ncountry, urging Daniel Layton to see that enough votes be given by the\r\nRepublican legislators to assure a majority in both Houses. In the\r\nSenate all but five of the seventeen members were Republicans; in the\r\nHouse, all but twelve of thirty-five. If they had adhered to the\r\nexpressed policy of their party the amendment could have been ratified\r\nthe first day of the session. On March 30 word was received that the\r\nMississippi Senate had ratified the Federal Amendment. This was\r\nfollowed by a telegram from Mississippi to the anti-ratificationists\r\nin Delaware that this Senate vote was only \"a flash in the pan\" and\r\nwould be reconsidered. A meeting of the Republican opponents\r\ntelegraphed to the Speaker of the House in Mississippi: \"Stand firm\r\nagainst ratification. Delaware Legislature still firm for State's\r\nrights and will not ratify.\" A hasty call was made for a meeting of\r\nall the Republican members of the Senate and House favorable to\r\nratification. This was addressed by the Governor, by United States\r\nSenator Ball, and by Congressman Layton, father of \"Dan\" Layton, who\r\nhad always heretofore favored woman suffrage. By this time, however,\r\nthe whole question had narrowed to his personal fight against Governor\r\nTownsend and at this conference he publicly announced that he would\r\noppose ratification.\r\n\r\nThe Governor did everything possible to make it easy for the leaders\r\nof the southern part of the State to bring over its representatives to\r\nthe amendment. In a noble speech he offered to withdraw his candidacy\r\nfor delegate to the National Democratic convention if the Sussex\r\ncounty members would vote for it. John E. McNabb, the Democratic floor\r\nleader, boldly repudiated the telegrams from President Wilson, his\r\nCabinet, Homer Cummings, chairman of the Democratic National\r\nCommittee, and other party leaders. He said that not twenty-five\r\npersons in his district favored ratification and in two days a\r\npetition from five hundred was handed to him by Mrs. F. E. Bach and\r\nMrs. Pennewell of Wilmington. Alexander P. Corbitt, Speaker of the\r\nHouse, was indirectly connected with the Pennsylvania railroad and to\r\nhim was due a large share of the responsibility of its defeat.\r\nProminent among the lobbyists were Henry B. Thompson of Wilmington,\r\nhusband of the president of the Anti-Suffrage Association; Major\r\nEdmund Mitchell, former Republican State chairman; George Gray, former\r\nFederal Judge; George A. Elliott, Mifflin Wilson, George W. Sparks and\r\nHenry P. Scott of Wilmington, chairman of the State Republican Ways\r\nand Means Committee. His argument, widely circulated, was as follows:\r\n\"If the Legislature will refuse to ratify the proposed amendment and\r\nthus prevent the hysterical rout of the politicians of the country to\r\nmake shreds and patches of our sacred Constitution, the State of\r\nDelaware will receive in the near future the greatest possible glory.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Townsend went to New York and laid the danger of the\r\nsituation before T. Coleman du Pont, whose influence in the State was\r\nvery great. He came to Wilmington, interviewed various men, wrote\r\nletters and then went to Dover where he worked for the amendment.\r\nGradually there was a weakening in the opposition with the gain of a\r\nvote here and there, but the southern part of the State remained\r\nsolidly opposed. On March 23 Senator Thomas F. Gormley (a \"wet\"\r\nDemocrat) introduced a bill providing for the submission of every\r\nconstitutional amendment to the electorate before ratification or\r\nrejection by the Legislature, which was defeated by 9 noes and 5 ayes.\r\n\r\nThe date for the vote was finally fixed for March 31 and as its defeat\r\nseemed certain, Assemblyman Hart, who, according to the rules, must\r\nagree to have it brought up, held off heroically under political\r\nthreats and intimidations of every kind and at last left the Capitol\r\nfor home. After a conference with \"anti\" members, Representative Lloyd\r\nintroduced an exact copy of the Hart resolution. Mr. Hart then brought\r\nup his resolution the next day, April 1, and it was defeated by 23\r\nnoes to 9 ayes, with 2 not voting. Meanwhile the lobbying went madly\r\non. Much of the opposition came from notable \"wets\"; and many of the\r\nopponents were connected with the Pennsylvania railroad.\r\n\r\nThe Republican State convention met in Dover April 20 and the Equal\r\nSuffrage Association made one of the most remarkable demonstrations\r\nthe State had ever seen. Every road was ablaze with decorated\r\nautomobiles and hundreds of suffragists arrived on every train. They\r\nmarched and they talked and in themselves they constituted the best\r\nargument that could be made for ratification. American flags and\r\nsuffrage banners were used all over the town. With Mrs. Ridgely\r\npresiding, speeches were made all day on the green in front of the\r\nState House, and from an automobile in front of the Republican\r\nconvention hall Miss Shuler and others spoke. Long petition sheets\r\nwith the names of 20,000 Delaware women asking for ratification were\r\nexhibited. The crowning feature of the day was a parade of \"suffrage\r\nchildren\"--the children of suffragists--a long line mounted on ponies\r\nand bicycles down to the babies in the \"go carts.\"\r\n\r\nThe speech of the permanent chairman of the convention, a staunch\r\nsuffragist, Robert Houston of Georgetown, Sussex county, was a strong\r\nappeal for ratification and it called out the greatest outburst of\r\nenthusiasm of the day. The convention unanimously passed a resolution\r\ncalling on the Legislature to ratify the amendment. On the table was a\r\nvase of jonquils, and when the president of the anti-suffrage\r\nassociation rushed to the platform and demanded that they be removed\r\nor that red roses be added she was met by the chairman of arrangements\r\nwith the quiet answer, \"We are not complimenting the 'antis' today, we\r\nare using the Republican color and that is the suffrage color.\" The\r\njonquils largely outnumbered the roses on the coats of the delegates.\r\n\r\nWhile no Republican could now vote against ratification without\r\nrepudiating his party it was plainly evident that the majority of\r\nDemocrats were opposed to it and on the day of their State convention\r\ntheir party leaders, including United States Senator Wolcott and the\r\nchairman, Josiah Marvel, blossomed in red, the \"anti\" color. Former\r\nUnited States Senator Saulsbury's paper printed editorials of violent\r\nopposition throughout the struggle.\r\n\r\nThe resolution to ratify the Federal Suffrage Amendment was called up\r\nin the Senate by Senator Walker Wednesday, May 5. Senator Gormley,\r\nDemocratic leader, offered as a substitute a referendum to the voters,\r\nwhich was defeated by a solid Republican vote of 13 to 4. The roll was\r\ncalled on the resolution to ratify and it was adopted by 11 ayes, 6\r\nnoes--ten Republicans and one Democrat voting for and two Republicans\r\nand four Democrats against it. The House had adjourned when the vote\r\nwas taken and the plan was to send the resolution to it Thursday\r\nmorning and attempt action Friday, but Thursday morning revealed a\r\nclear intention to defeat it and it was therefore placed under lock\r\nand key in the Senate. Senator Gormley attempted to offer a motion\r\nordering its delivery to the House but was ruled out of order by the\r\npresident pro tem. J. D. Short, whose recent accession to the suffrage\r\nranks had made the Senate victory sure.\r\n\r\nIn the House \"Bull\" McNabb launched an attack on those who were\r\nwithholding the resolution, using freely the words \"bribery,\"\r\n\"cajoling,\" \"threats\" and much profanity. Mrs. Thompson, the\r\nanti-suffrage president, kept calling out encouragement to him until\r\nthe Republican floor leader, William Lyons, had to ask her to stop.\r\n\r\nThe Senate refused to send the resolution to the House and finally the\r\nRepublicans succeeded in forcing an adjournment of the Legislature\r\nuntil May 17, hoping to bring about a change of sentiment. Some of\r\nthose who were interested in the ratification were asked to meet at\r\nthe capital that day. Among those who responded were Alfred I., T.\r\nColeman and Pierre S. du Pont, Governor Townsend, Senator Ball,\r\nRepresentative Layton, former United States Senator J. F. Allee,\r\nSecretary of State Johnson, Charles Warner, former Congressman Hiram\r\nR. Burton, Speaker Charles Grantland and others. These men argued and\r\npleaded with the Republican legislators to give the 36th and final\r\nratification of the 19th Amendment but without effect.\r\n\r\nOn May 28, twenty-three days after the resolution had passed the\r\nSenate, it was sent to the Lower House. In the interval the Labor\r\nUnion of Wilmington passed resolutions unanimously calling upon their\r\nthree Representatives, McNabb, Mulvena and Mulrine, to vote for\r\nratification. President Wilson was assured that only three Democratic\r\nvotes were needed and he, therefore, telegraphed these three: \"May I\r\nnot as a Democrat express my deep interest in the suffrage amendment\r\nand my judgment that it would be of the greatest service to the party\r\nif every Democrat in the Delaware Legislature should vote for it?\"\r\nSpeaker Corbit was interviewed by members of the Republican National\r\nCommittee and Republican leaders from within and without the State and\r\nstrongly urged to stand with his party, but to no avail. The\r\nresolution was read twice and a motion was unanimously carried that\r\nthe House resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole. Representative\r\nLyons here offered a motion to vote on the resolution, which was\r\ndefeated by 24 noes, 10 ayes. A motion was then put to adjourn until\r\n12.30, June 2, on which day it had been previously voted to adjourn\r\nsine die at noon, and it was carried! The House thus again placed\r\nitself on record against ratification and ended all further\r\nlegislative action.\r\n\r\nThe causes that led to the defeat were briefly: 1. Factional\r\ndifferences in the Republican party; antagonism toward Governor\r\nTownsend; half-hearted interest and even treachery on the part of\r\ncertain Republican leaders. 2. Democratic opposition either because of\r\nthe negro question or for national political reasons. 3. Influence of\r\nthe liquor interests. The cost of the campaign to the National\r\nAmerican Suffrage Association was approximately $4,500. The financial\r\ncost to the suffragists of the State could not be estimated and even\r\nmore impossible would be an estimate of time and labor during many\r\nmonths. [Long list of names of workers omitted for lack of space.]\r\n\r\nFollowing the final ratification of the Federal Amendment by the\r\nTennessee Legislature the Executive Board, which was in session at\r\nRehoboth, on August 27, 1920, merged the State Equal Suffrage\r\nAssociation into the League of Women Voters and elected Mrs. Ridgely\r\nchairman. This action was confirmed at a State convention held in\r\nWilmington September 29, 30.\r\n\r\nAmong men and women not elsewhere mentioned who have been helpful to\r\nwoman suffrage are Mrs. Mary T. Challenger, Lea Pusey, George B.\r\nMiller, Lewis W. Brosius, Mrs. J. R. Milligan; the Reverends Frederick\r\nA. Hinckley, Thomas P. Holloway, Adam Stengle, Alexander T. Bowser,\r\nJoel S. Gilfillan; Mrs. John F. Thomas, Congressman Thomas W. Miller,\r\nGeorge Carter, editor _Evening Journal_; Mrs. Samuel H. Derby, Frank\r\nC. Bancroft, master of the State Grange; Mrs. Samuel Bancroft, Mrs.\r\nFrancis I. du Pont, Mrs. Victoria du Pont, Sr., Mrs. Philip Burnett,\r\nSr., and others mentioned in the chapter.\r\n\r\nState officers not named otherwise were Mrs. William L. Duggin, Mrs.\r\nAlfred D. Warner, Mrs. Willard Morse, Mrs. Mary H. Thatcher, Miss\r\nElizabeth S. Gawthorp, Mrs. Mary Price Phillips, Mrs. Frederick L.\r\nSteinlein, Mrs. R. Barclay Spicer, Mrs. Harry Hayward, Mrs. George\r\nNewcombe, Miss Willabelle Shurter.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION, 1913. A bill to strike from the suffrage clause of\r\nthe State constitution the word \"male\" was for the first time\r\npresented to the Legislature. It was introduced in the Senate January\r\n7, by David J. Reinhardt; in the House by Albert I. Swan. The members\r\nhad been previously circularized by the corresponding secretary, Miss\r\nMary R. de Vou, announcing this action in the spirit of the age, in\r\nthe name of justice and democracy and for the credit of the State. On\r\nFebruary 26 a hearing was granted at a joint session, with the House\r\nchamber crowded. Mrs. Cranston introduced the speakers, headed by Dr.\r\nAnna Howard Shaw, national president. Miss Jeannette Rankin of\r\nMontana, a field worker sent by the National Association, spent two\r\nweeks in Dover, canvassing the legislators, assisted by members of the\r\nState association. At the Senate hearing March 14 strong speeches were\r\nmade by Senators Reinhardt, John M. Walker, and a number of leading\r\nwomen. Senators Zachary T. Harris and Dr. George W. Marshall worked\r\nfor the bill, which was endorsed by the Woman's Christian Temperance\r\nUnion, Ministerial Union, State Grange, Central Labor Union and\r\nSocialist Party, but it was lost the same day by 11 noes, 6 ayes. The\r\nbill was reported favorably by the House committee and Dr. John H.\r\nHammond declared that it was time to quit playing politics with it and\r\npass it but on March 19 it was defeated without debate by 23 noes, 8\r\nayes.\r\n\r\n1915. A full suffrage bill was presented jointly by the State\r\nassociation and the Congressional Union, introduced by Senator Harris\r\nand Representative Frank M. Saulsbury. The Campaign Committee\r\nrepresenting the two associations and headed by Mrs. Florence Bayard\r\nHilles opened headquarters at Dover with Miss Mabel Vernon in charge.\r\nExpenses of maintenance were paid by Mrs. George Day of Connecticut, a\r\nmember of the advisory council of the Union. A suffrage procession\r\nheaded by Mrs. Hilles and Mrs. Victor du Pont, Jr., marched to strains\r\nof martial music from the station to headquarters on its opening day\r\nearly in January and gave the stately old capital a decided\r\ninnovation. Speaking followed from a gaily decorated automobile.\r\n\"Suffrage fliers\" (motor cars) carrying able speakers and workers,\r\nmade whirlwind trips throughout the State. The anti-suffragists\r\norganized as a committee, with Mrs. Henry B. Thompson chairman and\r\nMrs. David J. Reinhardt secretary.\r\n\r\nOn January 21, before the Revised Statutes Committee of the House, all\r\nof the Representatives and many of the Senators, a hearing was given\r\nto the suffragists. The speakers were Mrs. Cranston, Miss Leila Aaron\r\nof Dover, Miss Vernon and Mrs. Hilles, whose argument was nearly\r\nflawless. On February 3 the \"antis\" spoke before practically the same\r\naudience and the enthusiasm equalled that of the suffrage hearing.\r\nThomas F. Bayard, brother of Mrs. Hilles, opened the hearing and\r\nintroduced Mrs. Thompson, Mrs. Grace W. Goodwin of Westfield and Mrs.\r\nPreston Lea, wife of a former Governor. On February 9 the suffragists\r\nwere granted a second hearing, all members of the Senate and several\r\nof the House being present. On February 16 the House Committee\r\nreported the bill favorably. On March 8, with an hour's interval\r\nbetween, the House killed it by a vote of 22 noes to 8 ayes; the\r\nSenate by a vote of 11 noes to 6 ayes. Legislative friends were\r\nSenators Edward Hart, John A. Barnard and Speaker Charles H.\r\nGrantland.\r\n\r\nPreceding the vote was a gay and colorful parade of suffragists,\r\nfollowed by speechmaking outside the State House. Able speakers and\r\nworkers from other States had spoken during the campaign, among them\r\nUnited States Representatives J. A. Falconer of Washington and William\r\nKent of California; Mrs. Kent, Mrs. Thomas R. Hepburn, president of\r\nthe Connecticut Equal Suffrage Association and Miss Anne Martin,\r\npresident of the Nevada association. Among local speakers were Dr.\r\nGeorge Edward Reed, D.D., former president of Dickinson College; John\r\nS. Hamilton of Wilmington and Mrs. Cranston. On March 11, three days\r\nafter the defeat, at a well-attended luncheon in Hotel du Pont,\r\nWilmington, was opened the campaign for 1917 in true Bunker Hill\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\n1917. A full suffrage bill was presented, the Congressional Union in\r\ncharge. The State was canvassed for and against. Before the joint\r\nhearing on February 16 the bill had been reported favorably by\r\ncommittees of both House and Senate. It went to defeat, however, on\r\nFebruary 23 by a vote in the House of 21 noes to 12 ayes, in the\r\nSenate on February 26 by a vote of 6 noes to 8 ayes. Among the\r\nanti-suffrage leaders were Judge George Gray, General James H. Wilson,\r\nMiss Emily P. Bissell, Mrs. George A. Elliott and Mrs. Henry P.\r\nScott.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[27] The History is indebted for this chapter to Miss Mary R. de Vou,\r\ncorresponding secretary of the Delaware Equal Suffrage Association\r\nfourteen years; also treasurer and auditor.\r\n\r\n[28] The Women's College affiliated with Delaware College at Newark,\r\nthe State College for men, was opened in September, 1914.\r\n\r\n[29] The History is indebted to Miss Winifred Morris, secretary of the\r\nState Equal Suffrage Association, for much of the material in this\r\nstory of the effort for ratification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.[30]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the women in the District of Columbia rejoiced with those in the\r\nStates over the successful end of the long, hard fight for the Federal\r\nSuffrage Amendment their joy was tempered by the fact that they still\r\nhad before them a struggle for an amendment which would enfranchise\r\nthe residents of the District--one really for equal suffrage, men and\r\nwomen alike being without the vote. The Congress itself now has entire\r\njurisdiction, each branch appointing a committee for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe district is a municipal corporation, administered by a Board of\r\nthree commissioners, two of whom are appointed by the President of the\r\nUnited States from civil life, confirmed by the Senate, the third\r\nbeing detailed by him from the engineer corps of the army. The\r\nargument for the citizen's franchise is that representation in\r\nCongress for the residents of the District would only give them a\r\nvoice in the governing body without impairing the \"exclusive\r\njurisdiction\" given to Congress by the National Constitution. It has a\r\npopulation greater than six of the States and pays taxes in excess of\r\ntwenty-two States--each of which has two Senators and Representatives\r\nbased on its population. Local self-government also is advocated by\r\nsome residents but the majority are behind the movement to obtain\r\nrepresentation in Congress and the vote for presidential electors.\r\nFrom the time this matter was first agitated the woman suffrage\r\nassociation of the District has insisted that women should have the\r\nsame rights granted to men.\r\n\r\nAlthough the suffragists of the District had no hope of\r\nenfranchisement from the Federal Amendment, nevertheless their\r\ninterest in the cause never flagged and they gave freely of their time\r\nand money to aid the movement for it. From 1869 to 1895 they assisted\r\nevery year the convention of the National Woman Suffrage Association\r\nin Washington, and afterwards whenever it was held in this city. Its\r\ngreat celebration of Miss Susan B. Anthony's 80th birthday in\r\nFebruary, 1900, gave a new impetus to the cause. The various societies\r\nhad been organized in 1898 into the District of Columbia State Equal\r\nSuffrage Association, corresponding to those in the various States.\r\nThe old parent society formed in 1868 and the first Junior Club were\r\naugmented by the Political Study Club organized in 1900, to study the\r\norigin, growth and government of cities and later agitating the\r\nquestion of placing women on boards of charities, schools, etc.; by\r\nthe Elizabeth Cady Stanton Club, organized in 1901, to take up the\r\nstudy of general taxation, methods of carrying on the public schools,\r\ntariff, finance and city government; by the College Equal Suffrage\r\nLeague, organized in 1909 and doing excellent work, and in 1916 by the\r\nAnthony League, organized in 1911 primarily for suffrage, but taking\r\nup civic affairs. The Woman Suffrage Council was formed from these\r\nsocieties in 1914 to aid the Congressional Committee of the National\r\nAssociation at its branch headquarters in Washington. The name was\r\nafterwards changed to Equal Franchise League when it was decided to\r\nkeep the organization intact for the purpose of working for suffrage\r\nin the district. Mrs. Glenna Smith Tinnin was the first chairman,\r\nfollowed by Mrs. George A. Mosshart and Mrs. Louis Brownlow.\r\n\r\nThe D. C. State Association held regular meetings about four times a\r\nyear and some special sessions. It kept the woman suffrage sentiment\r\nactive and was responsible for a great deal of progressive work. The\r\nfollowing served as presidents: Mrs. Helen Rand Tindall, 1898; Mrs.\r\nEllen Powell Thompson, 1899; Mrs. Carrie E. Kent, 1900; Mrs. Tindall,\r\n1901; Mrs. Kent, 1902-3; Mrs. Mary L. Talbott, 1904-5; Mrs. Jessie\r\nWaite Wright, 1906-7-8; Miss Harriette J. J. Hifton, 1909-10; Mrs. Le\r\nDroit Barber, 1911; Miss Florence Etheridge, 1912; Mrs. Nina E.\r\nAllender, 1913; Mrs. Kent, 1914; Miss Mary O'Toole, 1915 to 1920.[31]\r\n\r\nA number of prominent women in the District were officers of the local\r\nsuffrage clubs and worked under their auspices, being connected\r\nthrough them with the D. C. State Association. A part of the program\r\nof the latter in 1904-5 was a study of Fisk's Civil Government of the\r\nUnited States, Laws affecting Women and Children, taxation and other\r\nsubjects of public interest. There was also discussion of bills before\r\nCongress of special interest to women and the association supported\r\nthose for the protection of neglected and delinquent children,\r\ncompulsory education and restriction of child labor. A bill to raise\r\nthe salaries of public school teachers was strongly pressed. Among\r\nthose especially active were Mrs. Ellen Spencer Mussey, Dr. Emily\r\nYoung O'Brien and Mrs. Alice Stern Gitterman. Through their efforts\r\ntwo truant officers were appointed, one white and one colored. During\r\nthis period the work was being done which led to the establishment of\r\na Juvenile Court with one probation officer, Mrs. Charles Darwin. In\r\n1906 and 1907 the suffragists were active in agitating for women on\r\nthe Board of Education and succeeded in having two white women and one\r\ncolored woman appointed, as well as thirty women supervisors of the\r\npublic playgrounds. In 1908, also as a direct result of the efforts of\r\nMrs. Helen Rand Tindall and other members of the association, two\r\npublic comfort stations were built at a cost of $35,000, with bath,\r\nrest rooms and all sanitary conveniences, the first in the city. The\r\nassociation and the College Equal Suffrage League sent representatives\r\nto a hearing before the Commissioners to ask that if a referendum on\r\nthe excise question should be taken women should have a vote as well\r\nas men. In 1909 the association assisted in the petition work of the\r\nnational organization and paid the secretary who was in charge of\r\ntheir headquarters in Washington for keeping them open evenings. Under\r\nthe auspices of the association lectures were given by Mrs. Emmeline\r\nPankhurst and Mrs. Ethel Snowdon of England.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 at a hearing granted to the National Association by the\r\nJudiciary Committee of Congress the District was represented by Miss\r\nEmma M. Gillett and Mrs. Katharine Reed Balentine, who overheard one\r\nof its members say that if the women really wanted suffrage they\r\nshould do something more than come up there to make speeches so as to\r\nhave them cheaply printed and mailed without postage. Miss Gillett,\r\nwho soon afterwards was made chairman of the National Congressional\r\nCommittee, was so stimulated by this remark that at her request the D.\r\nC. State Association raised $100 and she herself contributed $100 and\r\nused the fund to circularize every candidate for Congress in the 1910\r\ncampaign. She appealed through the _Woman's Journal_ for\r\ncontributions, but only $14 were received. The circular asked seven\r\nsearching questions covering all forms of woman suffrage. The answers\r\nwere tabulated and sent out by the Associated Press. [See Chapter X,\r\nVolume V.]\r\n\r\nPresident Seth Low, of the National Civic Federation, called a\r\nconference in Washington Jan. 17-19, 1910, of delegates to be\r\nappointed by the Governors of States and \"presidents of commercial,\r\nagricultural, manufacturing, labor, financial, professional and other\r\nbodies national in extent.\" The program was to include discussions of\r\n\"public health, pure food regulations, uniform divorce law and\r\ndiscrimination against married women as to the control of their\r\nchildren and property.\" The suffragists asked the Commissioners to\r\nappoint women among the twelve delegates to represent the District,\r\nbut this was not done. Mr. Low in answering Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt's\r\ncriticism that women delegates had not been invited, said it had not\r\noccurred to him that women would be interested but that he would\r\nplace the name of the National Suffrage Association on the list for\r\nfuture calls of a like character.\r\n\r\nThis year the clergymen of Washington were circularized to ascertain\r\ntheir position on woman suffrage and the great field of usefulness it\r\nwould offer for women in moral and social reforms was pointed out.\r\nMiss Hifton and Miss Anna C. Kelton (afterwards Mrs. Harvey W. Wiley)\r\ntook charge of this work and the 129 letters they sent received only\r\neight answers, five in favor, two non-committal, one opposed. For the\r\nfirst time permission was obtained from the school board to post\r\nnotices of the national suffrage convention in the school buildings,\r\nMiss Anna MacLaren arranging for it.\r\n\r\nIn 1911 representatives of the association addressed many conventions\r\nin Washington and asked that resolutions favoring suffrage for women\r\nbe passed. They were not successful but presented their cause. In\r\n1912-13 the suffragists were busy among other things in agitating the\r\nquestion of having a woman as Juvenile Court Judge. President Taft\r\npractically promised the appointment, but the male incumbent was\r\nallowed to hold over another year. A meeting of women lawyers was held\r\nand a committee appointed to call on Attorney General Wickersham to\r\nurge the name of Mrs. Ellen Spencer Mussey, then Dean of the\r\nWashington College of Law. She was endorsed by several thousand men\r\nand women, over six hundred of whom were teachers in the public\r\nschools and familiar with Mrs. Mussey's excellent work on the Board of\r\nEducation, but no woman was appointed. (In 1918 Miss Kathryn Sellers,\r\npresident of the College Women's Equal Suffrage League, was appointed\r\nby President Wilson.)\r\n\r\nOn March 3, the day before the inauguration of Woodrow Wilson, for the\r\nfirst time women marched on Pennsylvania Avenue. The parade was\r\narranged by the Congressional Committee of the National Association,\r\nof which Miss Alice Paul was chairman. Objection being made by\r\nSuperintendent of Police Sylvester to giving a permit, the women\r\nappealed to the Senate Committee for the District on the ground that\r\nas citizens and tax-payers they had the right to use the avenue, and a\r\njoint resolution was passed by Congress granting it. Adequate police\r\nprotection, however, was not given, indeed some of the police\r\nthemselves hooted and jeered with the mob which attacked the paraders.\r\nDoubtless it was composed of persons who had come from outside to the\r\ninauguration. It took three hours to march the mile from the Peace\r\nMonument to the Treasury, where tableaux were given on the steps.\r\nFinally it was necessary to call the troops from Fort Myer. The Senate\r\nordered an investigation and the Police Superintendent resigned. It\r\nwas said that this parade won thousands of friends for the cause of\r\nwoman suffrage.\r\n\r\nThis year the Congressional Union was organized to work in the\r\nDistrict and the States solely for the Federal Suffrage Amendment,\r\nwith Miss Paul chairman, Miss Lucy Burns, Mrs. Crystal Eastman, Mrs.\r\nMary Beard and Mrs. Lawrence Lewis the other officers. It had its own\r\nheadquarters and was not affiliated with the National American\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nIn 1914 the suffragists protested again, this time to the Chamber of\r\nCommerce, against a constitutional amendment sponsored by it to\r\nenfranchise the residents of the District, because it did not\r\ndefinitely state that women should be included. This protest was also\r\ntaken up in the Federation of Women's Clubs through the auxiliaries of\r\nthe State Suffrage Association, which were affiliated with it. During\r\n1915 and 1916 suffragists addressed all the civic bodies in Washington\r\non the necessity of including women in any measure looking to the\r\nenfranchisement of the residents of the District. As a result of this\r\ncontinuous agitation a compromise was reached to hold the question in\r\nabeyance until a constitutional amendment was passed enabling Congress\r\nto grant suffrage to the District. The association as usual\r\nparticipated in commemorating the birthdays of Mrs. Stanton and Miss\r\nAnthony and placed wreaths on the bust of Lincoln in the rotunda of\r\nthe Capitol. It joined in the contest with the school board which\r\ntried to exclude married women as teachers.\r\n\r\nDuring the closing years of the long campaign for woman suffrage\r\nstreet meetings were held. Among those who helped in this work were\r\nMrs. Frank Hiram Snell, Miss Florence F. Stiles, Miss Elizabeth\r\nEggert, Miss O'Toole and Miss Sellers. Receptions were given to the\r\n\"yellow flier,\" the automobile sent across the continent by the\r\nNational Association, and to the \"prairie schooner,\" the car sent by\r\nthe Just Government League of Maryland to tour its southern counties.\r\nMiss O'Toole travelled with the \"schooner\" two weeks, speaking several\r\ntimes a day. A delegation from the College League met it at the\r\nDistrict line and a procession accompanied it into the city under\r\npolice escort. In the evening a public reception was given at the\r\nWashington College of Law. From 1916 the association assisted the\r\nNational Association at its new headquarters, 1626 Rhode Island\r\nAvenue, by serving tea afternoons and raising money through bazaars,\r\nrummage sales, card parties, etc.\r\n\r\nDuring 1918 all the suffrage societies in the District devoted their\r\nenergies to war work and co-operated in every possible way with the\r\nWoman's Committee of National Defense, whose headquarters were in\r\nWashington, Dr. Anna Howard Shaw chairman. They rejoiced in the\r\nsubmission of the Federal Suffrage Amendment by Congress in 1919 and\r\nits ratification in 1920, although notwithstanding their many years of\r\nloyalty and assistance to the National Association they could receive\r\nno benefit from the victory.\r\n\r\nMore women hold office in Washington than in any city in the world\r\nbecause of their very extensive employment by the National Government.\r\nWhen Volume IV of the History of Woman Suffrage was written in 1900 an\r\nofficial statement gave the total number of government employees in\r\nthe District as 20,109 men, 7,496 women, a total of 27,600. At the\r\nrequest of Mrs. Helen H. Gardener, a vice-president of the National\r\nWoman Suffrage Association and a member of the U. S. Civil Service\r\nCommission, the following information was sent in 1920 to be used in\r\nthis volume, by the president of the commission, Martin A. Morrison:\r\n\r\n     In 1907 the Bureau of the Census issued a report in which it was\r\n     stated that men outnumbered women in the Government service by\r\n     about eleven to one in Washington, D. C., and outside. The\r\n     percentage of women in the District was much larger than outside\r\n     for the reason that the great bulk of the employees in field\r\n     branches are in services the duties of which are not ordinarily\r\n     performed by women--the mechanical forces at navy yards, ordnance\r\n     establishments, engineer departments, reclamation service\r\n     projects, lighthouse service and the like; also the\r\n     letter-carriers, city and rural, railway mail clerks and such\r\n     classes.\r\n\r\n     It is believed that the proportion of women to men in the entire\r\n     service did not change materially until the beginning of the war.\r\n     When the United States entered the war, there were approximately\r\n     38,000 employees in the executive civil service in the District\r\n     of Columbia, approximately two-fifths of them women. The force\r\n     was increased by 80,000 during the war, of whom approximately 75\r\n     per cent were women. The force has now been reduced to about\r\n     90,000, of whom approximately 50,000 are women. The proportion of\r\n     women is being constantly reduced by the return of former\r\n     soldiers and sailors to civilian employment, who are allowed\r\n     preference under the law. The Federal Civil Service outside the\r\n     District of Columbia increased by approximately 280,000 during\r\n     the war period, possibly one-third of this increase made up of\r\n     women. That force numbers now about 550,000 as compared with\r\n     450,000 before the war and it seems safe to say that twenty per\r\n     cent. are women.\r\n\r\n     These positions are open to any who pass the civil service\r\n     examinations but the chiefs of the bureaus and departments are\r\n     appointed by the President, and Secretaries of Departments, and\r\n     they have always been men. Men have succeeded also in getting the\r\n     highly paid positions under civil service.\r\n\r\nNo law excludes women from the District offices. There are, of course,\r\nno elections. Some officials are appointed by the President, some by\r\nthe Commissioners, and the Supreme Court of the District appoints the\r\nBoard of Education, three of whose members must be women. In 1920\r\nPresident Wilson appointed Miss Kathryn Sellers, a member of the\r\nDistrict bar, to be Judge of the Juvenile Court. This was largely due\r\nto the efforts of Justice William Hitz, of the District Supreme Court.\r\nThe President appointed also Mrs. Clara Sears Taylor a member of the\r\nRent Commission, created to consider rent problems growing out of the\r\nwar, and Miss Mabel T. Boardman as Commissioner of the District. The\r\nCommissioners appointed two women trustees of the public library.\r\nFormerly it was necessary to make an effort to get women on the boards\r\nof charities, hospitals, etc., but now such places are seeking the\r\nwomen. Within the past ten years many women graduates of the law\r\nschools have been appointed as law clerks in various departments, War\r\nRisk, Treasury, especially the income and customs divisions, and in\r\nthe Solicitor's office for the State Department. The Interior\r\nDepartment appointed Miss Florence Etheridge, at one time president of\r\nthe D. C. State Equal Suffrage Association, probate attorney for the\r\nCherokee Indians. Miss Marie K. Saunders was the first woman appointed\r\npatent examiner, as the result of a competitive examination, and she\r\nhas been advanced until the next step is that of principal examiner.\r\nWomen hold important positions as secretaries of committees at the\r\nCapitol.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Commissioners appoint the Superintendent of Police and\r\nunder Major Raymond J. Pullman a Woman's Bureau was established in\r\n1918, after several women had been serving on the force. Mrs. Marian\r\nC. Spingarn was made director. When she left Washington the following\r\nyear Mrs. Mina C. Van Winkle was appointed and continues to hold the\r\nposition. To give her power she was made Detective Sergeant and in\r\n1920 was promoted to a Lieutenancy, so that she might legally be in\r\ncommand of a precinct where the Woman's Bureau is on the first floor\r\nof the house of detention and the preventive and protective work for\r\nwomen and children is directed. The functions of this bureau are very\r\nwide and very important and the work of the women police covers the\r\nentire city.\r\n\r\nThe national appointments of women have attracted the attention not\r\nonly of this but of other countries. They began in 1912 with the\r\nselection of Miss Julia C. Lathrop of Hull House, Chicago, by\r\nPresident Taft as Chief of the newly created Federal Children's\r\nBureau, which position she still holds (1920). President Wilson\r\nappointed Mrs. Frances C. Axtell in 1916 a member of the Federal\r\nEmployees' Compensation Commission; in 1920 Mrs. Helen H. Gardener a\r\nmember of the Civil Service Commission; Mrs. Annette A. Adams, U. S.\r\nAttorney in San Francisco, Assistant Attorney General; Miss Mary\r\nAnderson, chief of the Women's Division of the Department of Labor.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[30] The History is indebted for this chapter to Miss Mary O'Toole,\r\nattorney and counsellor at law, president of the District of Columbia\r\nState Equal Suffrage Association from 1915 to 1920, when the Federal\r\nAmendment was ratified.

Many of the above named also filled\r\nother offices.\r\n\r\nAmong the names which appear in the records of the years as chairmen\r\nof committees, in addition to many of the above, are those of Miss\r\nHelen Varick Boswell, Dr. Clara McNaughton, Miss Nettie Lovisa White,\r\nMrs. Katharine Reed Balentine and Miss Abby T. Nicholls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nFLORIDA.[32]\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the removal from the State of Mrs. Ella C. Chamberlain in 1897\r\nand no one found to take the leadership, the cause of woman suffrage,\r\nwhich was represented only by the one society at her home in Tampa,\r\nlanguished for years. In 1907 John Schnarr, a prominent business man\r\nof Orlando, circulated a petition to Congress for a Federal Suffrage\r\nAmendment which was sent down by the National Association and obtained\r\nnumerous signatures. It is interesting to note that, from the\r\nbeginning of the suffrage movement in Florida, men as well as women\r\nhave been its active supporters.\r\n\r\nAs the years passed and the movement waxed strong throughout the\r\ncountry and important victories were won, the women of Florida imbibed\r\nthe spirit of their day and generation. It became a frequent topic of\r\ndiscussion and women in various places began to realize the need of\r\norganization. On June 15, 1912, the Equal Franchise League was\r\norganized at Jacksonville in the home of Mrs. Herbert Anderson by\r\nherself and Mrs. Katherine Livingstone Eagan, with about thirty ladies\r\npresent. Monthly meetings were held in a room in a large new office\r\nbuilding given them for headquarters by the owners and forty-five\r\nmembers were enrolled. Mrs. Eagan, the president, soon went to Paris\r\nand her duties fell upon the vice-president, Mrs. Roselle C. Cooley;\r\nthe secretary, Miss Frances Anderson, and the other officers. In the\r\nautumn two leading suffragists, who were attending the National Child\r\nLabor Convention, were invited to address the League, but neither the\r\nBoard of Trade nor the Woman's Club would rent its auditorium for a\r\nsuffrage meeting, so they had to open a door between their\r\nheadquarters and an adjoining room and a large audience was present.\r\nThe league affiliated with the National American Suffrage\r\nAssociation, which the next year sent a field worker to help in\r\nlegislative work. In 1914 it published a special edition of _The\r\nState_, which was put into the hands of all the Florida members of\r\nCongress and the Legislature. Mrs. Medill McCormick, chairman of the\r\nNational Congressional Committee, sent one of the national workers,\r\nMiss Lavinia Engle, to assist. This year Mr. Heard, president of the\r\nHeard National Bank, gave the league the use of a large front room on\r\nits first office floor.\r\n\r\nOn Feb. 13, 1913, the Political Equality Club of Lake Helen was formed\r\nwith Mrs. S. A. Armstrong president and Mrs. Irene Adams secretary. On\r\nthe 27th the Equal Suffrage League of Orlando was organized with the\r\nRev. Mary A. Safford president, and in October the first demand for\r\nsuffrage was made here. The Mayor issued a notice that all freeholders\r\nmust register for the sewerage bond election by the 9th, and a few\r\nsuffragists saw their opportunity. Very secretly and hurriedly, before\r\nthe Mayor could get word of it and give notice that the election was\r\nmeant for men only, Miss Emma Hainer and Mrs. Helen Starbuck gathered\r\ntogether several women who owned valuable property and they went to\r\nthe city clerk's office and announced that they had come in response\r\nto the Mayor's call to register for the coming election. He referred\r\nthem to the Mayor, who referred them to the Council, which referred\r\nthem to the city attorney. He told them that the law did not permit\r\nwomen to register. This they knew, but their action caused a\r\ndiscussion of the question and disclosed a widespread belief that\r\nwomen should have the right to vote.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the executive board of the Orlando league in the home\r\nof Mrs. J. C. Patterson April 21 the question of forming a State\r\nAssociation was earnestly considered and Miss Safford was requested to\r\nprepare a \"call\" for this purpose. Soon afterwards she and Mrs.\r\nStarbuck were sent to Tallahassee by the league to aid the suffrage\r\nwork being done in the Legislature. Here the great need of a State\r\norganization was very apparent, as legislators constantly asked,\r\n\"Where are the suffragists from my district?\"\r\n\r\nDuring the summer through conversation with interested suffragists\r\nand correspondence with Mrs. Cooley, president of the Jacksonville\r\nleague, arrangements were made for calling a convention to organize a\r\nState association at Orlando at the time of the meeting of the State\r\nFederation of Women's Clubs. This took place Nov. 4, 1913, Miss\r\nSafford was chairman, Mrs. Isabel Stanley secretary of the convention\r\nand addresses were made by women from half a dozen towns. A committee\r\nwas appointed to draft a constitution and by-laws which reported at an\r\nadjourned meeting on the 6th, when they were adopted and the following\r\nofficers for the State Equal Suffrage Association were elected:\r\nPresident, Miss Safford, Orlando; first vice-president, Mrs. C. J.\r\nHuber, Webster; second, Mrs. Ella Chamberlain, Tampa; third, Miss\r\nCaroline Brevard, Tallahassee; corresponding secretary, Miss Elizabeth\r\nAskew, Tampa; recording secretary, Miss Frances B. Anderson,\r\nJacksonville; treasurer, Mrs. John Schnarr, Orlando; auditors, Mrs.\r\nAnna Andrus, Miami, and Mrs. J. M. Thayer, Orlando.\r\n\r\nIn 1914 Miss Safford published a bulletin, showing that the State\r\nAssociation had auxiliaries in Jacksonville, Lake Helen, Orlando,\r\nZellwood, Pine Castle, Winter Park, Pensacola, Milton, Miami, Tampa,\r\nand a Men's Equal Suffrage League in Orlando with Mayor E. F. Sperry\r\nas president and Justin Van Buskirk as secretary. Miss Kate M. Gordon,\r\npresident of the Southern Woman's Suffrage Conference, had held a\r\nsuccessful meeting in Jacksonville. The Orlando League had had a float\r\nin the trades' parade of the midwinter fair and a booth at the fair\r\nwhere the names of voters in favor of submitting a State suffrage\r\namendment were obtained. It had had \"teas\" for replenishing the\r\ntreasury and closed the year with a banquet complimentary to the Men's\r\nLeague. A committee was preparing a program on the laws of the State\r\nfor the next year's work. The Pensacola league was arranging to issue\r\na special edition of the _Journal_ and have a booth at the tri-county\r\nfair. Most of the leagues had formed classes to study history and the\r\nduties of citizenship and had distributed literature and some of them\r\nhad held a celebration on May 2, as the National Association had\r\nrequested.\r\n\r\nThe first annual convention, held at Pensacola, Dec. 8-10, 1914,\r\nstressed the pledging of candidates for Congress and Legislature and\r\nsecuring signatures to petitions. The second, at Orlando, Feb. 3,\r\n1915, formed congressional districts, according to the plan of the\r\nNational Association. The third, at Miami, March 15-16, 1916, arranged\r\nfor suffrage schools and planned to assist work outside the State. The\r\nfourth, at Tampa, Nov. 20, 1917, found the members busy with war work.\r\nThe fifth, at Daytona, Nov. 19, 1918, planned to introduce a bill for\r\nPrimary suffrage in the Legislature and co-operate with the Federation\r\nof Women's Clubs to secure it. The sixth, at Tampa, Oct. 30-31, 1919,\r\nwas devoted to plans for ratification of the Federal Suffrage\r\nAmendment and citizenship.\r\n\r\nWhile the State association could show no definite accomplishment, its\r\nwork had been largely educational and a considerable public sentiment\r\nin favor of woman suffrage had been created. Its organization and\r\ngrowth center about the name of the Rev. Mary Augusta Safford, a\r\npioneer worker in the suffrage cause in several States. She came in\r\n1905 to make Florida her home from Des Moines, Iowa, where she had\r\nbeen pastor of the Unitarian church for eleven years. Her energy,\r\nenthusiasm and devotion carried all before her and but for her\r\norganization might have been delayed for years. For four years she was\r\nthe untiring State president, then Mrs. Frank Stranahan served in\r\n1917, Miss Safford again in 1918. The following, in addition to those\r\nelsewhere mentioned, are among those prominent in the suffrage work in\r\nthe State: Mrs. A. E. McDavid, Miss Minnie Kehoe, Pensacola; Mrs.\r\nSusan B. Dyer, Winter Park; Mrs. H. W. Thompson, Miss C. H. Day,\r\nMilton; Mrs. S. V. Moore, Cocoanut Grove; Mrs. Kate C. Havens, Miami;\r\nMiss Pleasaunce Baker, Zellwood; Mrs. Grace Hanchett, Orlando.\r\n\r\nFrom its beginning the association worked for the Federal Suffrage\r\nAmendment, although it tried also to obtain from the Legislature the\r\nsubmission of a State amendment to the voters. In 1915 Dr. Anna Howard\r\nShaw, the national president, assisted Miss Safford and the other\r\nworkers in holding conventions in several congressional districts.\r\nMany local meetings were held, much literature distributed,\r\nresolutions secured and legislators interviewed. The Federation of\r\nWomen's Clubs, the largest organization of women in the State,\r\nendorsed the movement. In 1916 Miss Safford went for a month to\r\nassist the campaign in Iowa, to which the association sent $100, and\r\nthe vice-president, Mrs. Frank Tracy, directed the State work. New\r\nleagues were formed, delegates to the national presidential\r\nconventions were interviewed and Florida women attended those in\r\nChicago and St. Louis. Dr. Shaw was present at the State convention\r\nwhere 550 members were reported and the distribution of 750 packages\r\nof literature. A series of meetings was held in cooperation with the\r\nCongressional Committee of the National Association and work in the\r\nLegislature was done.\r\n\r\nBy 1918 a number of counties had been organized and the State\r\nconvention, encouraged by the granting of Primary suffrage to women in\r\nArkansas and Texas, decided to make this its legislative work for\r\n1919, and plans were made to raise $5,000 through local conferences. A\r\nState organizer was put into the field and the National Association\r\nsent its recording secretary, Mrs. Halsey W. Wilson, a trained worker,\r\nto assist the State organization. In January, 1919, Dr. Shaw attended\r\na conference at Orlando and $1,000 were raised; later at a conference\r\nin Tampa, $198 and at one in Miami and West Palm Beach $260. Miss\r\nElizabeth Skinner was appointed State organizer and the National\r\nAssociation sent one of its most capable organizers, Mrs. Maria\r\nMcMahon. The 38 county chairmen had obtained nearly 2,500 signatures\r\nto petitions to the Legislature and an active campaign was undertaken\r\nfor Primary suffrage.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1919, the National Association's Congressional Committee\r\nsent its secretary, Mrs. Minnie Fisher Cunningham of Arkansas, and its\r\npress secretary, Miss Marjorie Shuler of New York, to spend several\r\nweeks in a quiet campaign to influence U. S. Senator Park Trammell to\r\ncast his vote for the Federal Suffrage Amendment, this being\r\nconsidered useless in the case of Senator Duncan U. Fletcher. They\r\nsecured newspaper comment in favor, interviews with prominent people\r\nand resolutions from conventions, but these had no effect. At the\r\nannual convention in October the following officers were elected:\r\nPresident, Mrs. John T. Fuller, Orlando; first vice-president, Mrs.\r\nEdgar A. Lewis, Fort Pierce; second, Miss Elizabeth Skinner, Dunedin;\r\nthird, Dr. Minerva B. Cushman, St. Petersburg; corresponding\r\nsecretary, Mrs. W. R. O'Neal, Orlando; recording secretary, Mrs. C. E.\r\nHawkins, Brooksville; treasurer, Mrs. Clara B. Worthington, Tampa;\r\nauditors, Mrs. J. W. McCollum, Mrs. J. D. Stringfellow, Gainesville;\r\nLegislative Committee, Mrs. Amos Norris, chairman, Tampa. A memorial\r\nmeeting was held for Dr. Shaw, who had died July 2.\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting in 1920 took place in Orlando. Mrs. Fuller was\r\nre-elected and plans for extensive work were made but the association\r\nwas not quite ready to merge into a League of Women Voters. This was\r\ndone April 1, 1921, and Mrs. J. B. O'Hara was elected chairman.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. Before the State Association was organized the\r\nEqual Franchise League of Jacksonville decided to ask the Legislature,\r\nwhich met in April, 1913, to submit to the voters a woman suffrage\r\namendment to the State constitution. A bill was prepared and an appeal\r\nfor assistance made to the National American Association. In response\r\nit sent its very capable field worker, Miss Jeannette Rankin, who went\r\nwith the executive officers of the league to Tallahassee. Its\r\npresident, Mrs. Roselle C. Cooley, said in her report: \"The House of\r\nRepresentatives decided to hear us in a Committee of the Whole, at an\r\nevening session. In this case it meant the whole House, the whole\r\nSenate and the whole town. Seats, aisles, the steps of the Speaker's\r\nrostrum were filled, windows had people sitting in them and in the\r\nhall as far as one could see people were standing on chairs to hear\r\nthe first call for the rights of women ever uttered in the Capitol of\r\nFlorida. Four women and three men spoke, the vote of the committee was\r\npublicly called at the close of the speaking and the bill passed into\r\nthe House of Representatives without recommendation. Weary days and\r\nweeks of waiting, time wasted on petty legislation, members going home\r\nfor week-ends and not returning for Monday work kept us still anxious.\r\nAt length the bill was called and the vote was 26 ayes to 38 noes.\r\n\r\n\"As we were leaving for our homes on Saturday evening a Senator said:\r\n'If you will come into the Senate we will show those men how to treat\r\nladies.' So we went back on Monday and were fortunate in having for\r\nour sponsor Senator Cone of Columbia county, the leader of the\r\nSenate. He took up our bill, placed it on the special calendar and\r\nadvised us in our procedure, the bill having come into the Senate with\r\nfavorable recommendation from the committee. Again the weary waiting,\r\nthe petty legislation, the filibustering of the 'corporation' members\r\nand the whisky men, and at last a motion to postpone indefinitely was\r\ncarried by one majority, 15 to 16, the sixteenth man being one who had\r\nbeen with us from the first until this moment.\"\r\n\r\nThe Legislature meets every two years and in 1915 the State\r\nassociation, which had now sixteen well organized branches, was\r\nsponsor for the bill, or resolution, and a large number of legislators\r\nhad promised their support. Hearings were granted by both Houses, but\r\nit was defeated.\r\n\r\nIn 1917 strenuous efforts were again made in behalf of a State\r\nconstitutional amendment. Mrs. William Jennings Bryan, who now had a\r\nwinter home in Florida, was among those who addressed the Legislature\r\nin favor of it, and on April 23 the resolution to submit the amendment\r\npassed the Senate by 23 to 7. The struggle was then begun in the House\r\nbut the corporate and liquor interests combined with the\r\nnon-progressive character of many of the members accomplished its\r\ndefeat.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1919, the State Federation of Women's Clubs, which now had a\r\nsuffrage chairman, co-operated with the State Equal Suffrage\r\nAssociation in the effort to obtain a Primary Suffrage Bill, such as\r\nhad been passed by the Legislatures of Arkansas and Texas. Mrs.\r\nMcMahon, a national organizer, and Miss Skinner did organizing and\r\nlegislative work from March 6 to April 22. The former was sent to work\r\nfor Presidential suffrage, but the State Board believed that Primary\r\nsuffrage had a better chance. This, however, met with so much\r\nopposition that it was never brought up. The moment the Federal\r\nAmendment was submitted by Congress a delegation of women--Mrs. Frank\r\nStranahan, chairman of the Legislative Committee; Dr. Safford, Mrs. W.\r\nS. Jennings, Mrs. Edgar A. Lewis--went to Tallahassee to try to have\r\nthe Legislature ratify it, arriving one day before adjournment. They\r\nquickly canvassed the members and found a small majority willing to\r\nvote for it but there was no time. Governor Sidney J. Catts could\r\nhave called a special session for the next day but insisted that there\r\nwas no assurance of ratification, as some of the men listed as\r\nfavorable were in the habit of changing their vote, and he did not\r\nwant to put the members on record. Some of them who were alleged to be\r\nsupporters declared that they would not stay over even for one day. It\r\nwas impossible to persuade the Governor to call a special session at\r\nany time afterwards, but in 1920 Florida women were enfranchised by\r\nthis amendment.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE. By special acts of the Legislature, charters were granted to\r\nvarious cities giving Municipal suffrage to women and the voters\r\naccepted them. Sixteen towns had such a charter: Felsmere, Aurantia,\r\nCocoa, Orange City, Deland, West Palm Beach, Delray, Florence Villa\r\n(where Dr. Anna Howard Shaw had a winter home for a number of years),\r\nMiami, Fort Lauderdale, Moore Haven, Orlando, Clearwater, Dunedin, St.\r\nPetersburg, Tarpon Springs. Felsmere was the pioneer, receiving its\r\ncharter in 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[32] The History is indebted for this chapter to Alice G. (Mrs.\r\nGeorge) Kollock, prominent in the work for woman suffrage in Florida,\r\nwith thanks to others who assisted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nGEORGIA.[33]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first suffrage society in Georgia was formed at Columbus in 1890\r\nand the second in Atlanta in 1894. Here the first State convention was\r\nheld in 1899 and the State association, auxiliary to the National\r\nAmerican Woman Suffrage Association, never ceased its labors until the\r\nyear following the ratification of the Federal Woman Suffrage\r\nAmendment.\r\n\r\nMrs. McLendon became an officer in 1892 and held official position\r\nduring the entire twenty-nine years. For thirteen years she was\r\nvice-president or honorary president and for the remainder of the time\r\npresident of the association. Mrs. Thomas was second honorary\r\npresident for five years before her death in 1906. The following\r\nserved as presidents: Miss H. Augusta Howard, 1890-1895; Mrs. Frances\r\nCater Swift, 1895-1896; Mrs. Mary L. McLendon, 1896-1899; Mrs.\r\nGertrude C. Thomas, 1899-1901; Miss Katherine Koch, 1901-1904; Mrs.\r\nRose Y. Colvin, 1904-1906; Mrs. Mary L. McLendon, 1906-1921.[34]\r\n\r\nIn 1900 the same suffrage measures presented the year before were\r\nagain offered to the Legislature with the same barren result. The\r\nSouthern Chautauqua invited the association to hold an all day meeting\r\nand also engaged Miss Frances A. Griffin of Alabama to lecture. F.\r\nHenry Richardson, editor of the Atlanta _Journal_, and Lucian Knight,\r\neditor of the Atlanta _Constitution_, brought the \"woman's rights\r\nmovement\" as prominently before the public as they were permitted to\r\ndo by the managers of those newspapers.\r\n\r\nOn Nov. 25, 26, 1901, the State convention was held in the\r\nUniversalist Church of Atlanta. Addresses were made by Mrs. Carrie\r\nChapman Catt, president of the National Association; Mrs. Thomas, Mrs.\r\nAlice Daniels and Mrs. McLendon. The meeting adjourned early in the\r\nafternoon to go to the Atlanta Women's Club room, where Mrs. Catt was\r\ninvited to address that body. The night meeting was held in the hall\r\nof the House of Representatives, where Mrs. Catt, Mr. Richardson and\r\nthe Hon. Robert R. Hemphill of South Carolina addressed a large and\r\nappreciative audience. The convention decided to employ a State\r\nlecturer and organizer.\r\n\r\nWith but two exceptions State conventions or conferences were held\r\nevery year, always in Atlanta until 1919, in the Congregational and\r\nUniversalist churches, in the Grand Building, the hall of the\r\nFederation of Labor, the Carnegie Library, the Hotel Ansley and the\r\nPiedmont Hotel. The membership gradually increased, a series of\r\nliterary meetings in the winter of 1902 adding fifty names. This year\r\na committee was appointed to revise the charter of Atlanta and the\r\nofficers of the association appeared before it and asked that it\r\ninclude Municipal suffrage for women. The sub-committee on franchises\r\nrecommended that instead it provide for women on school, hospital,\r\npark and health boards, but the general committee reported adversely.\r\nThe Atlanta branch protested to Mayor Livingstone Mims against the\r\ninjustice of not allowing women taxpayers to vote on the proposed\r\n$400,000 bond issue. He expressed himself in favor of woman suffrage\r\nand promised to bring the matter before the city council, but there\r\nwas no result.\r\n\r\nMiss Kate M. Gordon, national corresponding secretary, gave a most\r\nconvincing address in the Carnegie Library the next year, 1903, on how\r\nthe taxpaying women of Louisiana won the right to vote on questions of\r\ntaxation; strong articles were published, but all the women were able\r\nto do was to post large placards at the polls, \"Taxpaying women should\r\nbe allowed to vote at this bond election.\" Dr. Anna Howard Shaw,\r\nnational vice-president-at-large, came to assist at the State\r\nconvention and delivered her famous lecture, \"The Fate of Republics.\"\r\nThis year the association distributed 10,000 pages of suffrage\r\nliterature at the Interstate Fair. It attempted to bring a bill before\r\nthe Legislature for police matrons but not a member would introduce\r\nit.\r\n\r\nDuring these years the suffragists found it very difficult to persuade\r\na legislator to present a bill for raising the age of consent or\r\ncompulsory education in order to take the young children out of the\r\nfactories or for the enfranchisement of women. In 1905, at the request\r\nof the National Association that fraternal greetings should be sent to\r\nvarious organizations, Mrs. McLendon, who had been a member of the\r\nWomen's Christian Temperance Union since 1890, carried them to its\r\nconvention and made an earnest but unsuccessful effort to have it\r\nadopt a franchise department. Thousands of pieces of suffrage\r\nliterature were distributed at the State Fair. In 1906 memorial\r\nservices were held for the great leader, Susan B. Anthony, and the\r\nassociation carried out to its full power all the State work planned\r\nby the National Board, including a petition to the Legislature to pass\r\na resolution asking Congress to submit a Federal Suffrage Amendment.\r\n\r\nThe membership of the association was increased in 1907 by the\r\naddition of three prominent W. C. T. U. officials, Mrs. J. J. Ansley,\r\nMrs. Jennie Hart Sibley and Mrs. L. W. Walker, who were promptly\r\nappointed superintendents of Church Work, Legislation and Petition and\r\nChristian Citizenship. Miss Jean Gordon of New Orleans and Mrs.\r\nFlorence Kelley of New York made splendid addresses in favor of woman\r\nsuffrage when they came to Atlanta in April to attend the Child Labor\r\nConvention. Dr. Shaw gave a stirring suffrage speech in the hall of\r\nthe House of Representatives on May 4.\r\n\r\nThe evening sessions of the annual convention in 1908 were held in the\r\nSenate Chamber of the Capitol. Miss Laura Clay, Mrs. Sibley, Miss H.\r\nAugusta Howard and W. S. Witham were the speakers, with Mrs. McLendon\r\npresiding. Miss Clay's address, entitled Who Works Against Woman\r\nSuffrage? created a profound impression and she was of much\r\nassistance. Mrs. McLendon was invited to speak before the convention\r\nof the Georgia Agricultural Association, one of the oldest in the\r\nState, on Woman's Education and Woman's Rights. A rising vote of\r\nthanks was accorded her and the address ordered printed in the\r\nminutes. The State Prohibition convention placed a strong woman\r\nsuffrage plank in its platform and the delegates to the national\r\nconvention were instructed to vote for one if it was offered. Mr.\r\nWitham, the Rev. James A. Gordon and Mr. Barker, editor of _The\r\nSouthern Star_, worked faithfully for this plank.\r\n\r\nIn 1909, at the request of the National Association, letters were\r\nwritten to Georgia's Senators and Representatives in Congress, asking\r\nthem to vote for a Federal Woman Suffrage Amendment. Polite but\r\nnon-committal replies were received from Senators Clay and Bacon and\r\nRepresentatives Griggs and Lewis. The other eight evidently did not\r\nconsider disfranchised women worthy of an answer. The city council of\r\nAtlanta decided that its charter was forty years behind the times and\r\nagain a committee of forty-nine men was appointed to draw up a new\r\none. The Civic League, an Atlanta auxiliary to the State Suffrage\r\nAssociation, set to work to have this new charter recognize the rights\r\nof the women taxpayers. It was discovered that the women paid taxes on\r\nmore than $13,000,000 worth of real and personal property in the city.\r\nSeveral hundred personal letters were written to leading taxpaying\r\nwomen asking their opinion of the league's movement; only favorable\r\nreplies were received and many friends of the cause developed among\r\nthe influential women. Strong articles were published in the city\r\npapers and widely copied throughout the State, but the charter\r\nentirely ignored the claims of women. Many letters were written to\r\nRepublican and Democratic delegates asking them to vote for a suffrage\r\nplank in their platforms. The annual convention was not held in Macon,\r\nas intended, because there was so much sentiment against it in that\r\ncity. This year women in the Methodist Church South became active to\r\nsecure laity rights, which had been granted to women members in the\r\nNorth, East and West after they had worked years for it, but the\r\nbishops in the South were bitterly opposed to it. Mrs. Mary Harris\r\nArmor, the well-known national organizer and lecturer for the W. C.\r\nT. U., and four years president for Georgia, joined the suffrage\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\nThe National Association's petition to Congress had been distributed\r\nthroughout the State for signatures and returned to Washington. In\r\n1910 letters were written to President Taft, to the members of\r\nCongress from Georgia and to Governor \"Joe\" Brown, as requested by Dr.\r\nShaw, national president. Senator Clay and Representatives W. C.\r\nBrantley, S. A. Roddenberry and W. C. Adamson were the only ones who\r\ncould spare time to answer. Atlanta was to have an election for a\r\nthree-million dollar bond issue on February 15, Susan B. Anthony's\r\nbirthday, and the Mayor and president of the Chamber of Commerce had\r\nappealed to the City Federation of Women's Clubs to \"make the men go\r\nto the polls to vote for bonds.\" The suffragists distributed broadcast\r\na poster headed by a cartoon by Louis Gregg representing women of all\r\nsorts, armed with brooms, umbrellas, rolling pins, etc., driving the\r\nmen to the polls.\r\n\r\nOver 6,000 pages of suffrage literature were distributed in the State,\r\na considerable amount of it to young people engaging in debates or\r\nwriting essays. Dr. James W. Lee and Dr. Frank M. Siler, Methodist\r\nministers of Atlanta, fearlessly expressed themselves in their pulpits\r\nas in favor of the enfranchisement of women, regardless of the fact\r\nthat Bishop Warren A. Candler was bitterly opposed to it. Dr. Len G.\r\nBroughton of the Baptist church and Dr. Dean Ellenwood of the\r\nUniversalist also declared themselves as favoring equal rights in\r\nChurch and State for women. Judge John L. Hopkins, one of Georgia's\r\nforemost lawyers, who codified the laws, proclaimed himself a believer\r\nin equal rights for women in a letter to the _Constitution_. In June\r\nwhen it was again proposed to revise the charter of Atlanta, a\r\ncommittee from the Civic League went before the charter committee and\r\npresented a petition asking Municipal suffrage for women. Later at a\r\nmeeting of the city council the petition was brought up for\r\nconsideration and was treated with ridicule and contempt. On August 8\r\nthe association held its convention in the hall of the Federation of\r\nLabor, its true friend. Walter McElreath of Fulton county offered a\r\nresolution that the House of Representatives should be tendered for\r\nthe evening session, but Joe Bill Hall, a noted anti-prohibitionist\r\nand anti-suffragist, marshalled the liquor men and they defeated it.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 the State association conformed to the plan of the National\r\nand appointed a committee of education, who would offer money prizes\r\nfor the best essays on woman suffrage by the seniors of the high\r\nschools, with Mrs. Helmer chairman and Miss Koch secretary. It worked\r\nvigorously for the bill to permit women to practice law. Mrs. Rebecca\r\nLatimer Felton became a member and was elected a delegate to the\r\nnational suffrage convention in Philadelphia. Attorney Leonard J.\r\nGrossman joined the association and was made general counsel.\r\n\r\nIn 1913, while Mr. Grossman was attending the convention of the\r\nNational American Woman Suffrage Association as a delegate, he was\r\nrequested by James Lees Laidlaw, president of the National Men's\r\nLeague for Woman Suffrage, to undertake the organization of a Georgia\r\nMen's League. He did so immediately on returning home, with the\r\nfollowing officers: President, Mr. Grossman; vice-presidents, the Rev.\r\nFred A. Line, the Rev. J. Wade Conkling, C. W. McClure, Dr. Frank\r\nPeck, E. L. Martin, ex-president Macon Chamber of Commerce; S. B.\r\nMarks and L. Marquardt, ex-presidents of the State Federation of\r\nLabor. Mr. Grossman toured the State on behalf of woman suffrage under\r\nthe joint auspices of the Men's League and the State association. He\r\ndrafted, at their request, proposed bills and ratification\r\nresolutions; appeared before the annual conventions of the Federation\r\nof Labor, obtaining their formal endorsement of woman suffrage;\r\nsecured also the endorsement of the Civic Educational League,\r\ncomprising a great majority of the Jewish citizens of Atlanta;\r\noccupied church pulpits and addressed women's clubs, civic bodies,\r\ncity councils and legislative committees. The members of the Men's\r\nLeague gave whatever assistance was required.\r\n\r\nThe many State victories in 1912 put new life into the movement in\r\n1913. The Georgia Young People's Suffrage Association was organized\r\nwith Miss Ruth Buckholz as president. To represent the association\r\nMrs. Amelia R. Woodall, corresponding, and Miss Katherine Koch,\r\nrecording secretary; Miss Mamie Matthews, treasurer of the young\r\npeople's society, Mrs. Landis Sanna, Mrs. Margaret Gardner, editor\r\nTrox Bankston of West Point and J. J. Williams of Chatterton, were\r\nsent to Washington to march in the parade on March 3. They carried the\r\nsuffrage flag made for the national convention in Atlanta in 1895,\r\nwith two handsome yellow banners prepared especially for the parade.\r\nFive bills before the Legislature were supported this year as well as\r\nthe Federal Amendment. When Presidential suffrage was given to\r\nIllinois women in 1913, the Atlanta _Constitution_ was so impressed\r\nwith the \"nearness\" of woman suffrage that it created a suffrage\r\ndepartment and offered the editorship to Mrs. McLendon. U. S. Senators\r\nHoke Smith and Augustus O. Bacon had been obliged to present the\r\npetition of Georgia suffragists asking for the Federal Amendment, but\r\nno beautiful speeches were made by them. Senator Smith had been on\r\nrecord all his life as being \"unalterably opposed to woman suffrage\"\r\nand voted against it whenever he had opportunity, adding insult to\r\ninjury by declaring, \"Our best women do not want it.\" Senator W. S.\r\nWest, who succeeded Senator Bacon, was more amenable to reason, but\r\nSenator Thomas W. Hardwick, who followed after Mr. West's death, has\r\nbeen an implacable opponent. For the second time the Atlanta\r\nFederation tendered the use of its beautiful Temple of Labor for the\r\nday sessions of the State convention which met July 9, 10. The\r\nLegislature was persuaded by John Y. Smith of Fulton county to permit\r\nan evening session in the House of Representatives. Senator Starke\r\nopposed the use of the Senate Chamber \"because Christ did not select\r\nwomen for his Disciples\" but saner counsels prevailed and it was\r\nopened for a session.\r\n\r\nDuring 1914 there were 275 meetings in Atlanta, Rome, Athens, Decatur,\r\nMacon and Bainbridge by the auxiliary societies, with five open air\r\nmeetings. On March 1 a mass meeting was held in the Atlanta theater to\r\nwhich members of the Legislature were especially invited. The speakers\r\nwere officers of the National Association, including the\r\nvice-president, Miss Jane Addams. To enlarge the scope of the work\r\nthere was organized in February the Woman Suffrage Party Incorporated,\r\nas a branch of the State association, with Mrs. McLendon president.\r\nIt secured a charter and prepared for an aggressive state-wide\r\nsuffrage campaign. A chairman for each of the twelve congressional\r\ndistricts was appointed and instructed to organize in her district.\r\nThis year for the first time a hearing was granted before the House\r\nCommittee on Constitutional Amendments. Mrs. Felton and Mrs. Rose\r\nAshby spoke for the association, Mrs. Cheatham and Mrs. Frances Smith\r\nWhiteside for the Woman Suffrage League. The association distributed\r\n40,000 pages of leaflets, fliers, newspapers, etc.; about a dozen of\r\nthe leading newspapers were supplied with local and national suffrage\r\nnews and members of the Legislature with suffrage literature. In 1900,\r\nwhen the first National W. C. T. U. convention was held in Atlanta,\r\nwoman suffrage was a forbidden subject at all temperance meetings in\r\nGeorgia. In 1914, when the second was held, Mrs. McLendon, president\r\nof the State Suffrage Association, was selected to welcome the White\r\nRibboners in behalf of the suffragists of the State.[35]\r\n\r\nThe annual convention of the State association was held July 21, 22,\r\nin the ballroom of the Hotel Ansley, beautifully decorated for the\r\noccasion. Miss Kate M. Gordon aided largely in making it a success.\r\nMrs. Annie Fletcher of Oldham, England, visited Atlanta this year and\r\nspoke on the suffrage situation there. Mrs. Georgia McIntyre Wheeler,\r\na practicing attorney of West Virginia, helped greatly in securing the\r\nWoman Lawyer Bill. Atlanta and Waycross suffragists applied to the\r\ncity governments to grant women Municipal suffrage. The association\r\ndid not parade on May 2, as requested by the National Board, but the\r\npresident made a suffrage speech on the steps of the State Capitol and\r\nmembers sold copies of the _Woman's Journal_. The Rev. A. M. Hewlett,\r\npastor of St. Marks Methodist Church South, accompanied Mrs. McLendon\r\nand Attorney Grossman to Cox College in March and by invitation of its\r\npresident they gave addresses in favor of suffrage for women before\r\nthe student body. There was a growing sentiment in favor of it among\r\nclergymen of various denominations.\r\n\r\nThe State convention was held in Atlanta Nov. 15-20, 1915, at the same\r\ntime as the harvest festival, and the first suffrage parade took\r\nplace, led by Miss Eleanor Raoul on horseback. Mrs. McLendon followed\r\nin the little yellow car which once belonged to Dr. Shaw, driven by\r\nMrs. Loring Raoul. As a protest against taxation without\r\nrepresentation Dr. Shaw allowed it to be sold for taxes and it was\r\nbought by Miss Sallie Fannie Gleaton of Conyers, who walked behind it\r\nin the parade. The suffrage carriages were decorated with yellow,\r\nthose of the W. C. T. U. with white. Mrs. William R. Woodall,\r\npresident of the Atlanta association, and Miss Katherine Koch had\r\ncarried on a suffrage school the first and second Wednesdays from\r\nFebruary 24 to December 1. The motion picture suffrage play Your Girl\r\nand Mine had been put on in the Grand Opera House. The branch in Rome\r\npublished an official organ called _The Woman's Magazine_.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1916, the State association and its three auxiliaries in\r\nAtlanta worked with the Equal Suffrage Party and the Woman Suffrage\r\nLeague to secure 10,000 names to a petition to the city council asking\r\nfor the Municipal franchise. State Senator Helen Ring Robinson of\r\nColorado and Mesdames Brooks, Kenney and Horine of Washington, D. C.,\r\ncame to their assistance. There were street speaking from automobiles\r\nat night and meetings at private residences and they secured over\r\n9,000 names. The city council gave a hearing, the Hon. Claude Peyton\r\nmaking the presentation speech. The members listened apathetically and\r\nappeared much relieved when Attorney Robert M. Blackburn assured them\r\nthey could not give women Municipal suffrage, as the State\r\nconstitution declared only male citizens could vote. Letters were sent\r\nto the delegates to the two national conventions of the dominant\r\npolitical parties, asking them to put a strong suffrage plank in their\r\nplatforms and Mrs. Woodall and Mrs. Laura Couzzens responded to Mrs.\r\nCatt's call for marchers at the Chicago and St. Louis conventions.\r\nGovernor N. E. Harris refused to include woman suffrage in the call\r\nfor the special session of the Legislature which made the State \"bone\r\ndry,\" but this year it enacted a number of laws for which the\r\nassociation had long worked.\r\n\r\nOn Feb. 12, 13, 1917, officers of the National Association held a\r\nsuffrage school in Atlanta. When the Legislature assembled in June all\r\nthe members found on their desks a notice that bills granting\r\nMunicipal suffrage to women, also full suffrage, and one to raise the\r\nage of consent from 10 years to 18 would be introduced. The State\r\nassociation sent the national suffrage organ, the _Woman Citizen_, for\r\na year to the United States Senators and fourteen Representatives in\r\nCongress; to the members of the Legislature and all State officials.\r\nThe Atlanta association again conducted a three months' suffrage\r\nschool. The State convention in December in the Assembly Hall of the\r\nPiedmont Hotel closed with a luncheon at which many prominent men and\r\nwomen were present. Representatives John C. White and John Y. Smith at\r\nthat time pledged themselves to introduce and work for suffrage bills.\r\nDuring this and the following year the suffrage associations did their\r\nfull share of war work. Mrs. McLendon represented the State\r\nassociation on the Women's Council of National Defense, and Mrs.\r\nMartin, first vice-president, was chairman of the State\r\nAmericanization Committee.\r\n\r\nIn 1918 the Parent-Teacher Association adopted strong suffrage\r\nresolutions. The Baptist and Methodist churches South granted laity\r\nrights to women. State suffrage headquarters were deluged with\r\nrequests for literature by educational institutions for debates. The\r\nState Superintendent of Public Instruction, Professor M. L. Brittain,\r\nhad been an advocate of votes for women many years. The Atlanta\r\n_Journal_ gave the State association a column in its Sunday issues,\r\nwhich Mrs. Martin edited. Raymond E. White wrote a number of fine\r\nsuffrage editorials for the _Constitution_. In July the Hearst papers\r\ncirculated a petition for a Federal Suffrage Amendment and the Atlanta\r\nassociation secured 5,000 names and other auxiliaries 1,000.\r\n\r\nOn May 3, 1919, a progressive city Democratic Central Committee gave\r\nAtlanta women the right to vote in the Municipal primary election to\r\nbe held September 3. A Central Committee of Women Citizens was at once\r\nelected at a mass meeting of women to see that they registered and\r\nnearly 4,000 did so, paying one dollar for the privilege.\r\n\r\nMrs. McLendon represented the State Association at the convention of\r\nthe National Association in St. Louis in March, 1919. On May 21 she\r\nand her sister, Mrs. Felton, sat in the House of Representatives in\r\nWashington and had the pleasure of hearing W. D. Upshaw, member from\r\nthe fifth congressional district of Georgia, vote for the submission\r\nof the Federal Suffrage Amendment, the only Representative from the\r\nState to do so. On June 4 the new U. S. Senator, William J. Harris of\r\nGeorgia, voted for the submission of this amendment, giving one of the\r\nlong needed two votes. The official board of the State Association\r\nthrough Mrs. McLendon mailed to each member of the Legislature a\r\npersonal letter with copies of letters from Mrs. J. K. Ottley, the\r\nDemocratic Executive Committee woman from Georgia, and the eminent\r\nclergyman, Dr. J. B. Gambrell, urging the members to ratify the\r\nFederal Suffrage Amendment. The annual convention of 1919 was held in\r\nthe auditorium of the Hotel Piedmont, Atlanta, on December 5.\r\n\r\nA League of Women Voters was organized in Atlanta in March, 1920, out\r\nof the Equal Suffrage Party, but the State association decided that\r\nthis action was premature, since there were no women voters in\r\nGeorgia, and that the old association, organized in 1890, would never\r\ndisband until women could vote on the same terms as men.\r\n\r\nOn June 1, in response to a petition of fifty representative women of\r\nAtlanta, a hearing in charge of Mrs. McLendon was granted by the\r\nchairman of the Democratic Executive Committee, at the request of\r\nMayor Key. After a number had spoken a motion was made to let the\r\nwomen vote in the white municipal primary in Atlanta and was carried\r\nwith only four negative votes. The Atlanta and the Young People's\r\nSuffrage Associations endorsed the re-election of Mayor Key and worked\r\nfor him, and he was returned by a majority of three to one on July 28.\r\nAfterwards several other cities and villages permitted women to vote\r\nin the primaries and on bond issues.\r\n\r\nAfter the Federal Suffrage Amendment was ratified in August 1920, it\r\nwas announced that women would not be permitted to register and vote\r\nin the primary on September 8 and the runover primary of October 6 for\r\nthe general election because they had not registered for it in April\r\nand May, which they had no right to do. When the Legislature had\r\nassembled June 23, Mrs. McLendon, Mrs. Martin and Mrs. Woodall had\r\ncalled on Representatives Covington and John Y. Smith and Senators\r\nElders Dorris and Pittman and begged them to introduce an Enabling Act\r\nto provide for the women to vote in November if the 19th Amendment\r\nshould be ratified. They promised faithfully to do this and the\r\nSenators did so, but it was held back. The Representatives never did\r\nintroduce it. Mrs. McLendon then appealed to Governor Dorsey, but he\r\nwas candidate for U. S. Senator and had no time to attend to it. The\r\nLegislature adjourned and the women were left in the lurch.\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. McLendon decided to make a test and see if women could not\r\nvote in the primary on September 8, as the returned soldiers who did\r\nnot reach Georgia before May were allowed to vote in all elections\r\nwithout registering. She wired to Senator Fermor Barrett of Stevens\r\ncounty, chairman of the sub-committee of the State Democratic\r\nExecutive Committee, asking him to call it together and see if it\r\ncould provide some way. He called it to meet in Atlanta on September\r\n3, and he and H. H. Dean made speeches and voted to try to arrange it,\r\nbut the other five members voted against it. Mrs. McLendon then went\r\nto the chairman of the County Democratic Executive Committee and he\r\nrefused to take any action, saying, \"Our committee is only the agent\r\nof the State committee and must obey its mandates.\" Then she and Mrs.\r\nJulia H. Ellington, Mrs. Jane Adkins and Mrs. Nancy Duncan called on\r\nthe tax collector and asked to be allowed to pay their State and\r\ncounty taxes and to register. They were sent to the chairman of the\r\nRegistration Committee and he also refused to enroll their names. Then\r\nthey went to the polls September 8 and were told, \"No women voting\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. McLendon telegraphed to Bainbridge Colby, Secretary of State, who\r\nanswered: \"The matter to which you refer is not within the province of\r\nthis Department and I am not in a position to give you any advice with\r\nregard thereto.\" She next asked Governor Dorsey to call an extra\r\nsession of the Legislature to provide some way for the women to vote\r\nin the general election, but he said he could not. Then she went to a\r\nfull meeting of the State Democratic Executive Committee, held\r\nSeptember 16, but no chance to be heard was given her. The next day\r\nshe attended a meeting of the Fulton County Commissioners, who\r\ndeclared their willingness but their inability to do anything. She\r\nthen called on Attorney General R. A. Denny, who advised her to go to\r\nthe polls and make the effort, saying: \"The 19th Amendment is above\r\nthe laws of any State.\" Women in Georgia, however, were not permitted\r\nto vote at the Presidential election two months after they had been\r\nenfranchised by this amendment.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. The first request for woman suffrage was put\r\nbefore the Legislature in 1895, the last in 1920, and in the interim\r\nevery session had this subject before it, with petitions signed by\r\nthousands of women, but during the quarter of a century it did not\r\ngive one scrap of suffrage to the women of the State. From 1895 bills\r\nfor the following measures were kept continuously before it: Age of\r\nprotection for girls to be raised from 10 years; co-guardianship of\r\nchildren; prevention of employment of children under 10 or 12 years\r\nold in factories; women on boards of education; opening of the\r\ncolleges to women. Year after year these bills were smothered in\r\ncommittees or reported unfavorably or defeated, usually by large\r\nmajorities. In 1912 a bill was passed enabling women to be notaries\r\npublic; in 1916 one permitting women to practice law, which the\r\nsuffragists had worked for since 1899; in 1918 one raising the age of\r\nconsent to 14. The suffrage association had worked for it twenty-three\r\nyears and always asked that the age be 18.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1912 another association to further the movement for woman suffrage\r\nwas formed in Atlanta, the Woman Suffrage League, and Mrs. Frances\r\nSmith Whiteside, who had been from early days a member of the old\r\nassociation, was elected president. Mrs. Whiteside was for thirty\r\nyears principal of the Ivy Street school and during the first ten\r\nyears of the existence of the State Association she was the only\r\nteacher who dared avow herself a member, as the very name of suffrage\r\nwas so odious to the public. Through her family connections and wide\r\nacquaintance she was able to exercise a strong personal influence in\r\nbringing well-known men and women to a belief in this cause. The\r\nleague did active work among teachers and business women and converted\r\nsome of the leading legislators. It inaugurated an educational\r\ncampaign in the schools and gave business scholarships for the best\r\nessays on woman suffrage. In co-operation with the other associations\r\nit obtained signatures to petitions for the Municipal franchise. The\r\nfirst street speaking was done under its auspices.\r\n\r\nWhen Leagues of Women Voters were authorized by the National American\r\nSuffrage Association in 1919, the organization disbanded and the\r\nmembers entered the league formed in Georgia. Mrs. Whiteside had been\r\ncontinually the president and there had been only two changes in the\r\nboard of the following officers: First vice-president, Mrs. Elizabeth\r\nMcCarty; second, Miss Laura Barrien; corresponding secretary, Mrs.\r\nJack Hawkins; recording secretaries, Mrs. William H. Yeandle, Mrs.\r\nMary Peyton; treasurer, Miss Ethel Merk; auditors, Mrs. A. G. Helmer,\r\nMiss Minnie Bellamy. Mrs. Yeandle died in 1915 and Mrs. Mary Peyton\r\nwas elected in her place. This year Mrs. Helmer became president of a\r\nbranch league and was succeeded as auditor by Miss Minnie Bellamy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EQUAL SUFFRAGE PARTY OF GEORGIA.[36]\r\n\r\nFor some time there had seemed a necessity in Georgia for an\r\norganization which would undertake more aggressive work in behalf of\r\nwoman suffrage. Early in 1914 the psychological time for it became\r\napparent and a meeting was held at the home of Mrs. Emily C. McDougald\r\nin Atlanta. A group of influential men and women were present, who\r\ndeclared themselves in favor of an active campaign and pledged their\r\nsupport. On motion of Linton C. Hopkins a committee was appointed to\r\nnominate temporary officers, and reported for president Mrs.\r\nMcDougald; for vice-president, Mrs. Hopkins, and for secretary, Mrs.\r\nHugh Lokey. A constitution and by-laws were adopted and a petition\r\nfor a State charter was filed under the name of the Equal Suffrage\r\nParty of Georgia.\r\n\r\nOn July 29 a meeting was called for permanent organization and with\r\nrepresentatives from different parts of the State present the\r\nfollowing were elected: President, Mrs. McDougald; first\r\nvice-president, Mrs. John Dozier Pou of Columbia; second, Miss Mildred\r\nCunningham of Savannah; secretary, Mrs. Henry Schlesinger; treasurer,\r\nMrs. Benjamin Elsas; organizer, Mrs. Mary Raoul Millis; auditor, Miss\r\nGenevieve Saunders, all of Atlanta. Members of the Executive Board\r\nwere: Mrs. Mary Meade Owens of Augusta; Mrs. Mayhew Cunningham of\r\nSavannah; Miss Anna Griffin of Columbus; Mrs. Charles C. Harrold of\r\nMacon. Affiliated branches were organized with presidents as follows:\r\nIn Savannah, Mrs. F. P. McIntire; in Augusta, Mrs. Owens; in Columbus,\r\nMiss Anabel Redd; in Atlanta, Miss Eleanore Raoul; in Macon, Mrs.\r\nHarrold; in Athens, Mrs. W. B. Hill; in Albany, Mrs. D. H. Redfearn.\r\n\r\nFrom these centers a great deal of work was done for suffrage in the\r\nadjacent smaller towns. The city organizations opened offices and\r\ncommittees of local women were put in charge of the work of raising\r\nmoney and distributing suffrage propaganda. Tens of thousands of\r\nletters, leaflets, books and speeches were distributed throughout the\r\nState. All of the women's clubs were urged to endorse suffrage;\r\nschools were asked to debate the subject and prizes offered for the\r\nbest arguments in debate and in written composition. Suffrage parades\r\non foot and in automobiles were had in all the cities, suffrage plays\r\nput into the theaters, suffrage slides into the movies and every means\r\nof educating the public was used. The best national speakers were\r\nbrought into the State and immense audiences worked up for them. The\r\nbeloved Dr. Anna Howard Shaw spoke in Atlanta to one of 6,000. The\r\nNational American Woman Suffrage Association, of which the Equal\r\nSuffrage Party was an affiliated branch, gave hearty co-operation in\r\nsecuring these speakers. The party held annual conventions, where new\r\nofficers were generally elected as a matter of democratic policy. The\r\nsecond took place in Atlanta Nov. 17, 1915, where Mrs. McDougald was\r\nre-elected president and the other officers selected were Mrs. J. D.\r\nPou of Columbus, first vice-president; Mrs. Cunningham, second; Miss\r\nSchlesinger, secretary; Miss Aurelia Roach, treasurer; Mrs. Millis,\r\norganizer. The party already had branches in 13 counties, including\r\nthe largest cities.\r\n\r\nThe annual convention on Oct. 28, 1916, was held in Atlanta and Mrs.\r\nL. S. Arrington of Augusta was elected president; Mrs. S. B. C. Morgan\r\nof Savannah, first vice-president; Mrs. Harrold, second; Miss Julia\r\nFlisch, secretary, and Miss Annie G. Wright, treasurer, both of\r\nAugusta. The effort in Atlanta to secure a petition for Municipal\r\nsuffrage for women had resulted in obtaining the signatures of 6,000\r\nwomen and 3,000 men. All the delegates to three national Presidential\r\nconventions had been circularized in behalf of a plank for Federal\r\nwoman suffrage, and all the members of the Legislature asking for the\r\nsubmission of a State amendment. The next annual convention was held\r\nin Augusta Nov. 24, 1917, and Mrs. Frank P. McIntire of Savannah was\r\nselected for president. The convention was omitted in 1918, as the\r\nwomen were occupied with war work.\r\n\r\nAt the convention held in Savannah Jan. 15, 1919, Mrs. McDougald was\r\nagain elected president. The splendidly efficient service of women in\r\nall the departments of war work proved that without them it would have\r\nbeen most difficult to succeed in the Liberty Bond sales, the Red\r\nCross and all the \"drives\" for raising money. The officers of the\r\nEqual Suffrage Party and those of its affiliated societies were\r\nselected as leaders in the work of the Woman's Council of Defense,\r\nNational and State.\r\n\r\nFrom every part of the State hundreds of letters were sent to the U.\r\nS. Senators Smith and Hardwick, asking them to vote for the Federal\r\nSuffrage Amendment, but to no avail. The year had been a fruitful one,\r\neven though the Legislature had failed to ratify the Federal\r\nAmendment, which was submitted by Congress in June. An adverse\r\ninfluence, which it was very hard to combat, was that of the State\r\nFederation of Women's Clubs. Its president, Mrs. Z. L. Fitzpatrick of\r\nMadison and other officials were violently opposed. A large majority\r\nof the women in the city clubs were suffragists and not influenced by\r\nthe attitude of the federation officers but this was not true of the\r\nrural women, who were constantly warned that woman suffrage was a\r\ngreat evil not to be even mentioned in their clubs. This\r\nanti-suffrage influence reacted upon the rural legislator and gave him\r\nground for the oft-repeated argument, \"The women of my district do not\r\nwant the vote, they won't even discuss it in their clubs.\" There had\r\nlong been a strong desire to have woman suffrage endorsed by the State\r\nFederation, the largest organization of women in the State, with\r\n30,000 members, and every year the Equal Suffrage Party had sent to\r\nall the club presidents an earnest letter urging them to give their\r\nmembers an opportunity to vote on the question and pointing out the\r\ngreater achievements of the clubs in States where women had the\r\nfranchise. At every annual meeting, however, when a resolution would\r\nbe offered from the floor, the president of the federation would\r\ndeclare it out of order and prevent action on it. In 1917, at its\r\nconvention in Augusta, a resolution was offered to send a\r\ncongratulatory telegram to the women of New York on their newly\r\nacquired enfranchisement, whereupon a storm of protest arose, the\r\npresident ruled it out of order and it was tabled.\r\n\r\nIn 1919 every club was again circularized and the answers showed that\r\nthe women throughout the State wanted favorable action by the State\r\nFederation. At its convention in Columbus in November, 1919, two\r\nresolutions were prepared, one or the other to be presented, as seemed\r\nmost expedient at the time. One was a simple endorsement of woman\r\nsuffrage; the other, submitted by Mrs. Morgan, asked for an\r\nendorsement of the Federal Amendment and its ratification by the\r\nLegislature. At the last moment, the suffragists decided to take a\r\nbold step and send the latter to the Resolutions Committee, which was\r\ndone, and this committee recommended its adoption. The president, Mrs.\r\nJames E. Hayes of Montezuma, ruled it out of order. Mrs. Rogers Winter\r\nof Atlanta appealed from the decision of the chair; Mrs. Alonzo\r\nRichardson of Atlanta seconded the appeal and was sustained and the\r\nresolution was brought before the convention. It was carried by a vote\r\nof 85 to 40.[37]\r\n\r\nWhen the report of this action was received in Macon, an indignant\r\nprotest went up from the anti-suffragists. Mrs. Bruce Carr Jones,\r\nsecretary of the State Federation, sent in her resignation. Mrs.\r\nWalter D. Lamar and Mrs. Thomas Moore went before the women's clubs of\r\nthe city and urged that they withdraw from the federation. The Macon\r\n_Telegraph_ devoted much space to denouncing it as a most dishonest\r\ntrick and approved heartily the efforts of these women to dismember\r\nthe federation. Through their influence six clubs resigned. Sixty-nine\r\nnew clubs joined the federation in the twelve months following its\r\nendorsement of the Federal Amendment.[38]\r\n\r\nThe white women of Atlanta were given the vote in the city Primaries\r\nin May, 1919. For several years all the suffrage forces in the city\r\nhad been working to secure this privilege from the Democratic\r\nExecutive Committee, but without success. In 1919, however, the\r\npersonnel of the committee had changed to such an extent that it was\r\ndecided to make another effort. The chairman, E. C. Buchanan, was a\r\ngood friend and with his help Mrs. A. G. Helmer, Mrs. Charles Goodman\r\nand Mrs. McDougald had the opportunity of making a personal canvass of\r\neach of its forty-four members. When the chairman called a meeting for\r\nMay 3, to consider, he said, the request of the Equal Suffrage Party,\r\nthere was every reason to believe they would make a favorable report.\r\nA resolution written by Mrs. McDougald was adopted by a vote of 24 to\r\n1. On the roll call each man stood up and in a few gracious words\r\nexpressed his pleasure in being able to show his confidence in the\r\nhelpful co-operation of women in city government by granting them this\r\nsuffrage. A mass meeting of women was called at once to name a central\r\ncommittee to take charge of the task of getting the women registered\r\nimmediately as a city election was near at hand. Miss Eleanore Raoul\r\nwas made chairman, and with her able co-workers in every ward\r\naccomplished a wonderful work. Public meetings addressed by prominent\r\nmen and women were held daily; $1,200 were raised and 4,000 women were\r\nregistered in a few weeks. The Executive Committee in 1920 again\r\nincluded women in the electorate and to this body of men is due the\r\nhonor of being the first in Georgia to recognize the value of women in\r\ncivic affairs.\r\n\r\nIn 1919 all the district school superintendents inaugurated a series\r\nof competitive debates on the question, Shall Georgia Grant Suffrage\r\nto the Women of the State? This created intense interest in every\r\ncounty and the Equal Suffrage Party found it difficult to supply the\r\ndemand for literature from the hundreds of schools. The Atlanta\r\nChamber of Commerce elected five women as members in recognition of\r\ntheir public service. In addressing the Landowners' Convention at\r\nSavannah in November Governor Hugh M. Dorsey said: \"I hope that as\r\nGovernor of Georgia I may be given the privilege of signing a bill\r\ngiving women equal rights in this great commonwealth.\"\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. In June, 1915, the Equal Suffrage Party made its\r\nfirst effort to sponsor a suffrage bill in the Legislature. It opened\r\na booth in one of the corridors between the House and Senate chambers,\r\nsupplied it with the best suffrage literature and put it in charge of\r\na committee of women who worked faithfully to convert some of that\r\nwilful and reactionary group of politicians. It was a hopeless task.\r\nThe first bill was introduced in the House by Mr. Wohlwender of\r\nMuscogee county and in the Senate by Senators Dobbs and Buchanan and\r\nreferred to the Judiciary Committee, which granted a hearing.\r\nRepresentatives from all the suffrage associations were present and\r\nmade speeches. Mrs. Walter D. Lamar and Miss Mildred Rutherford, head\r\nof the Lucy Cobb Institute of Athens, represented the Anti-Suffrage\r\nAssociation. Mrs. Lamar's arguments were based upon the theory that\r\nwomen did not have sufficient integrity to be trusted with the ballot;\r\nthat long years ago when those of New Jersey had it it had to be taken\r\nfrom them because they were so dishonest in their use of it. She also\r\nsaid that women were universally the hardest taskmasters, requiring\r\nmore work and paying less for it than men. Miss Rutherford begged the\r\nlegislators to disregard the request of the few women desiring the\r\nballot, as they did not represent the true type of the southern woman,\r\nwho had always rejoiced in being upon a high pedestal where men had\r\nplaced her and worshipped her and that women were more than satisfied\r\nwith that which men had so lavishly and chivalrously given--their love\r\nand their money. These speeches were received with howls of\r\nappreciation from the legislators, who dwelt upon the type that\r\nappealed to them, \"the woman who was the mother of children and\r\nrealized that her place was at home with her hand on the cradle.\" The\r\ncommittee made an unfavorable report.\r\n\r\nIn 1916 this experience was repeated. In 1917 and 1918 the leaders of\r\nthe Equal Suffrage Party were absorbed in war work and had no time to\r\nwaste in so helpless and disagreeable a task. They realized that they\r\nwould soon be enfranchised by a Federal Amendment, the only hope of\r\nthe women of Georgia.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. In 1919 came the great struggle over ratification. The\r\nbest the suffragists hoped for was that no action would be taken.\r\nDuring the first days of the session, however, the resolution to\r\nratify was introduced in the House by Representative J. B. Jackson of\r\nJones county and in the Senate by Senator T. H. Parker of Colquitt\r\ncounty, both of whom explained that their action was taken in order to\r\nkill it. The resolution was referred in both Houses to the Committees\r\non Constitutional Amendments and a joint hearing was set for an early\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nThe suffragists had more friends and stronger ones on the House\r\nCommittee than the \"antis\" and more than they had realized. All they\r\nasked was that the resolution be tabled, not reported favorably, for\r\nthey knew that defeat on the floor of the House was certain. One of\r\ntheir strongest supporters, Judge W. A. Covington of Colquitt county,\r\nwas detained at home by illness in his family and telegraphed the\r\nchairman of the House Committee, John W. Bale of Floyd county, asking\r\nthat the hearing be postponed a few days so that he might be present.\r\nThis courtesy, commonly extended without question, was refused by Mr.\r\nBale. Immediately on the opening of the hearing Mr. Jackson asked to\r\nsubstitute for his original resolution one which explicitly rejected\r\nratification. By permission of the chairman this substitute was\r\naccepted. After the hearing, at which Miss Rutherford alone appeared\r\nin opposition while seven women spoke for it, the committee went into\r\nexecutive session. On a motion to postpone action the vote was 13 to\r\n13, and the chairman cast his vote against it. During the executive\r\nsession Robert T. DuBose of Clarke county became ill and asked if he\r\nmight cast his vote ahead of time and leave. Permission was granted\r\nhim and he wrote on a slip of paper a vote for postponing action. When\r\nthe final vote was taken Mr. Bale ruled that Mr. DuBose's vote could\r\nnot be counted. If it had been the suffragists would have carried\r\ntheir point by a vote of 14 to 13. After the motion to postpone was\r\nlost the Jackson resolution to reject was reported favorably.\r\n\r\nThe Senate Committee acted in open session. After prolonged debate the\r\nParker resolution to ratify was reported unfavorably by a vote of 10\r\nto 3, and the next day it came before the Senate. The opponents\r\nbelieved they could make short work of it or they would not have\r\npermitted it to come up. By a vote of 37 to 12 the Senate refused to\r\ndisagree to the committee report. In order to dispose of the\r\nresolution, however, it was necessary to agree to the report and when\r\nthis motion was made the suffrage supporters started a \"filibuster\"\r\nwhich they continued for several days. Finally the anti-suffrage\r\nSenators promised that if the suffragists would call off their\r\n\"filibuster\" they would vote to recommit the resolution to the\r\ncommittee with the understanding that it would stay there the\r\nremainder of the session. But on the same day that this agreement was\r\nmade Senator Parker introduced another resolution, which, like the\r\nJones substitute, called for rejection of ratification. It was\r\nreported favorably by the committee and after several days' debate,\r\nSenators Claude Pittman, W. H. Dorris, H. H. Elders and George G.\r\nGlenn, speaking for ratification, the rejection resolution was carried\r\non July 24 by 39 to 10. The Senate then voted down a proposition to\r\nsubmit to the voters a woman suffrage amendment to the State\r\nconstitution. On the same day the Jackson resolution to reject was\r\npresented in the House and after a spirited debate led by Judge\r\nCovington and A. S. Anderson for ratification the resolution was\r\ncarried by 132 to 34.\r\n\r\nThis contest had occupied about two-thirds of the time since the\r\nLegislature convened and yet the opponents, after all their efforts,\r\nfailed to have the Legislature go on record as rejecting the Federal\r\nAmendment, for the House resolution was never concurred in by the\r\nSenate and the Senate resolution was never concurred in by the House\r\nand the session adjourned without completing formal action. President\r\nWilson had sent a telegram urging ratification for party expediency\r\nand U. S. Senator Harris went to Atlanta to lobby for either\r\nratification or no action, but he was denounced by the legislators and\r\nthe President was called a \"meddler.\" Members of the Democratic\r\nNational Committee and Clark Howell, editor of the Atlanta\r\n_Constitution_, and James Hallanan, its political editor, strongly\r\nsupported ratification, as did Governor Dorsey. The suffrage\r\nassociations made no effort in 1920, knowing the hopelessness of it.\r\nThe National Woman's Party endeavored to secure an Enabling Act, so\r\nthat women might vote under the Federal Amendment although the time\r\nfor registration had passed, but were not successful.\r\n\r\nThe last meeting of the Equal Suffrage Party was held in Atlanta\r\nduring the regional conference of the National League of Woman Voters.\r\nThirty-five States had ratified the Federal Amendment, and feeling\r\nassured that ratification would soon be fully accomplished, Mrs.\r\nMcDougald had gained the consent of all the branches to take this\r\noccasion to merge it into a State League. This was done April 3, 1920.\r\nMiss Annie G. Wright of Augusta was elected chairman and Mrs.\r\nMcDougald and Mrs. S. B. C. Morgan honorary presidents for life.[39]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[33] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Mary Latimer\r\nMcLendon, a resident of Atlanta over 60 years, who also wrote the\r\nGeorgia chapter for Volume IV. Before the absolutely necessary\r\ncondensation of the present chapter it included 22,000 words and was a\r\nmost remarkable production for a woman in her 81st year. It will be\r\npreserved intact in another place.\r\n\r\n[34] During the years from 1901 the following held office in the State\r\nassociation: honorary vice-president, Miss Madeline J. S. Wylie;\r\nvice-presidents, Mrs. P. H. Moore, Miss S. A. Gresham, Miss Rebecca\r\nVaughn, Miss H. Augusta Howard, Mrs. Emma T. Martin, Mrs. J.\r\nDejournette, Mrs. W. Y. Atkinson; corresponding secretaries, Mrs.\r\nMamie Folsom Wynne, Miss Katherine Koch, Mrs. DeLacy Eastman, Mrs.\r\nAmelia R. Woodall; recording secretaries, Miss Willette Allen, Mrs.\r\nAlice C. Daniels; treasurers, Mrs. E. O. Archer, Mrs. Mary Osborne,\r\nMrs. M. K. Mathews, Mrs. E. C. Cresse; auditor, Mrs. W. H. Felton.\r\n\r\n[35] In October, 1919, when Mrs. McLendon attended the W. C. T. U.\r\nconvention, she was called to the platform on the opening night,\r\npresented as a \"brave pioneer\" and highly eulogized by the present and\r\nformer State presidents. The audience gave her the Chautauqua salute\r\nand the White Ribbon cheer and in return she gave them a woman\r\nsuffrage speech, which was enthusiastically received. Nevertheless the\r\nState society never endorsed votes for women, although local societies\r\ndid so.\r\n\r\n[36] The History is indebted for this part of the chapter to Mrs.\r\nEmily C. McDougald, president of the Equal Suffrage Party of Georgia.\r\n\r\n[37] The resolution was voted on in the last hours of the convention\r\nand a number of the suffragists had taken trains for home. Mrs. Hayes\r\ndesired to have the resolution pass but as the convention the\r\npreceding year had sustained the ruling of the president that it was\r\nout of order she felt obliged to make a similar one.\r\n\r\n[38] The only organized antagonism to woman suffrage came from a very\r\nsmall but very vindictive association in Macon, vigorously abetted and\r\nencouraged by the _Telegraph_, the only paper in the State which\r\nfought suffrage and suffragists. Every week a column or more, edited\r\nby James P. Callaway, was filled with abuse of suffrage leaders and\r\nevery slanderous statement in regard to them which could be found.\r\nMiss Caroline Patterson of Macon was always president of this\r\nassociation and Mrs. Lamar, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Moore and a few other\r\nwomen, all of Macon, were ardent co-workers and leaders and frequent\r\ncontributors to Mr. Callaway's column. The association still holds\r\ntogether and the members are pledged not to vote but to give their\r\ntime and money to any effort made in the courts to invalidate\r\nratification of the Federal Amendment (1920).\r\n\r\n[39] In 1921 the League prepared a bill \"to remove the civil\r\ndisabilities of women,\" which provided that women should be eligible\r\nto vote in all elections, primary and general, in municipalities,\r\ncounties and the State, and should be eligible to hold public office.\r\nThe only objection made to the bill was to women on juries. The women\r\nobjected to this exemption but had to yield. In the Senate the vote on\r\nJuly 22 stood 36 for, 3 against; in the House almost unanimous on\r\nAugust 10. These legislators were so courteous and obliging the women\r\ncould scarcely believe it was a Georgia Legislature. They gave\r\neverything asked for and inquired, \"Is there anything else we can do\r\nfor you?\"\r\n\r\nThe State organizer of the League of Women Voters is Mrs. Z. L.\r\nFitzpatrick, former president of the State Federation of Women's\r\nClubs. She is most enthusiastic over the new order of affairs and is\r\ntouring the State organizing leagues and urging women to get out and\r\nvote and to nominate women for the offices!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nIDAHO.[40]\r\n\r\n\r\nIdaho women have been voting citizens for twenty-four years and during\r\nthese years much has been accomplished for the making of a bigger and\r\nbetter State, especially along educational lines. The women came into\r\ntheir suffrage sanely and quietly, working shoulder to shoulder with\r\nmen in everything vital to their country. State and local politics has\r\nbeen materially improved since women have been electors. No strictly\r\nsuffrage association has been maintained since the franchise was\r\ngranted, but when the National League of Women Voters was instituted\r\nin 1920 a branch was formed in Idaho with Dr. Emma F. A. Drake\r\nchairman. Work heretofore had been done through the Federation of\r\nClubs, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and other organizations\r\nof women. Political leaders always consider what women will think of a\r\ncandidate before he is nominated and it is constantly demonstrated\r\nthat nothing puts the fear of God into a man's heart like the ballot\r\nin the hands of a good woman. The women vote in about the same\r\nproportion as the men and there never is any criticism of it. Women\r\nhave worked for many good laws and have seen the most of them passed.\r\n\r\nThe women are not ambitious for office, but they fill regularly,\r\nwithout question, the following: State Superintendent of Public\r\nInstruction, County School Superintendent, County Treasurer, City\r\nTreasurer and, in many counties, Auditor and the appointive offices,\r\nLaw Librarian and assistant, Traveling Librarian and assistant. In\r\nJanuary, 1920, Governor D. W. Davis appointed Mrs. J. G. H. Gravely on\r\nthe State Educational Board. The following women have filled the\r\noffice of State Superintendent of Public Instruction: Miss Permeal\r\nFrench, Miss Belle Chamberlain, Miss Bernice McCoy, Miss May Scott,\r\nMiss Grace Shepherd, Miss Ethel Redfield; of Law Librarian: Mrs. Mary\r\nWood, Mrs. Arabella Erskine, Mrs. Carrie A. Gainer, Mrs. Minnie Priest\r\nDunton, Mrs. William Balderston; of Traveling Librarian: Mrs. E. J.\r\nDockery, Miss Louise Johnson, Mrs. Marie Schrieber, Miss Margaret S.\r\nRoberts.\r\n\r\nOnly six women have served in the Legislature, all in the Lower House:\r\nMrs. Hattie F. Noble, Mrs. Clara Campbell, Dr. Emma F. A. Drake, Mrs.\r\nMary Allen Wright, Mrs. Lettie McFadden, Mrs. Carrie Harper White.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. Governor Davis called a special session to ratify the\r\nFederal Suffrage Amendment Feb. 11, 1920. It was carried unanimously\r\nin the House, after Dr. Emma F. A. Drake, the only woman member of the\r\nHouse present, made a strong and logical speech introducing the\r\nresolution. It was carried in the Senate but had six opposing votes.\r\nThe following are the names of the men who were proud to vote against\r\nthe ratification: Elmer Davis of Boise county; C. B. Faraday of\r\nElmore; Ross Mason of Shoshone; R. T. Owens of Oneida; E. W. Porter of\r\nLatah; John S. St. Clair of Owyhee.[41]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[40] The History is indebted for this chapter to Miss Margaret S.\r\nRoberts, Librarian of the Idaho Free Travelling Library. A full\r\naccount of the winning of woman suffrage in 1896 will be found in\r\nVolume IV, History of Woman Suffrage.\r\n\r\n[41] If \"happy women have no history\" those of Idaho are fortunate, as\r\nthe above is all that could be obtained for the State chapter.--Ed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nILLINOIS.[42]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Illinois Equal Suffrage Association started on its work for the\r\nnew century with a determination to win full suffrage for women--the\r\none great purpose for which it was organized in 1869. The State\r\nconventions were always held in October or November. In the earlier\r\nyears they usually went to the \"down state\" cities or towns, but as\r\nthey grew large Chicago was generally selected. In October, 1900, the\r\nState convention was held at Edgewater and Mrs. Elizabeth Boynton\r\nHarbert of Evanston resumed the presidency, which she had held for a\r\nnumber of years. Delegates from four places besides Chicago were\r\npresent. Mrs. Catharine Waugh McCulloch was made legislative chairman\r\nand work was continued for needed changes in the laws.\r\n\r\nAt the convention of 1901 Mrs. Elizabeth F. Long of Barry was elected\r\npresident. Great effort was made to interest the press in the suffrage\r\nquestion and a leaflet entitled Suffrage for Women Taxpayers was\r\npublished and sent to all the large newspapers. The Chicago Teachers'\r\nFederation, under the leadership of Miss Margaret Haley and Miss\r\nCatherine Goggin, rendered valuable service in arousing the people to\r\nthe injustice of taxation without representation. The Ella Flagg Young\r\nClub, an organization of the women principals of the public schools,\r\naffiliated this year with the State suffrage association. Petitions\r\nwere circulated and suffrage resolutions passed by various kinds of\r\nclubs and plans were made to introduce in the next Legislature the\r\nMunicipal and Presidential suffrage bill as well as a full suffrage\r\namendment to the State constitution. Among the women who rendered\r\nefficient service in these early years were Dr. Julia Holmes Smith,\r\nMrs. Lucy Flower and Mrs. Lydia Avery Coonley-Ward.\r\n\r\nThe next convention was held in Jacksonville in 1902 and the Rev. Kate\r\nHughes of Table Grove was elected president. At the convention of 1903\r\nMrs. Hughes was re-elected. A feature of the educational work this\r\nyear was to urge the directors of the libraries of the State to place\r\non their shelves the official History of Woman Suffrage, recently\r\nbrought up to date. A leaflet by Mrs. McCulloch, Bench and Bar of\r\nIllinois, was published by the association and widely circulated. It\r\ngave the opinions of some of the ablest jurists and statesmen on the\r\nwoman suffrage question.\r\n\r\nAt the 1904 convention Mrs. McCulloch was elected president. Notable\r\ngrowth was made in suffrage societies during the year and favorable\r\nsentiment was aroused in organizations formed for other work. Among\r\nthese were the State Federation of Women's Clubs and the Teachers'\r\nFederation, the former with a membership of 25,000 and the latter with\r\n3,500. All party conventions but the Republican passed strong suffrage\r\nresolutions and all parties including this one nominated women as\r\ntrustees of the State University. The Democratic Mayor of Chicago,\r\nEdward F. Dunne, appointed Miss Jane Addams, Dr. Cornelia DeBey and\r\nMrs. Emmons Blaine as members of the School Board. The legislative\r\nwork was encouraging this year, for in both Senate and House the\r\nMunicipal and Presidential suffrage bill was reported out of committee\r\nwith favorable recommendations, and in the Senate it reached second\r\nreading.\r\n\r\nThe State convention of 1905 was held in Chicago and Mrs. Ella S.\r\nStewart was elected president. During the year much literature was\r\ndistributed and a committee was appointed, that included as many\r\nfederated club presidents as would serve, to secure if possible\r\nMunicipal suffrage in the new Chicago charter which was then being\r\nconsidered. Mrs. Charles Henrotin, former president of the General\r\nFederation of Women's Clubs, was appointed chairman. The women were\r\nallowed to make their appeal before several minor committees, but not\r\nbefore the whole Charter Convention, which tabled their request. The\r\nentire charter was tabled in the Legislature. Miss Alice Henry,\r\nformerly of Australia, editor of the magazine _Life and Labor_, gave\r\nvaluable assistance in organizing suffrage clubs. Educational work in\r\ncolleges was begun and Mrs. Elmira E. Springer, an ardent suffrage\r\nworker, contributed a fund of $1,000, the interest to be distributed\r\nas prizes at an annual inter-collegiate oratorical suffrage contest.\r\nAs a result suffrage societies were formed among the college students\r\nauxiliary to the State association. It published suffrage leaflets\r\nwritten by Judge Murray F. Tuley, a prominent Chicago judge; Mrs.\r\nEugenia M. Bacon, former president of the State Federation of Women's\r\nClubs, and one by Miss Anna Nicholes, an active settlement worker, on\r\nthe need of the ballot for the working woman.\r\n\r\nAt the convention of 1906 Mrs. Stewart was re-elected. Much literature\r\nwas published and valuable educational work was carried on in addition\r\nto the legislative work at Springfield under the auspices of Mrs.\r\nMcCulloch. In the fall of 1907 the State convention was held on the\r\nFair grounds at Springfield, and Mrs. Stewart was re-elected. At the\r\nconvention of 1908 Mrs. Stewart was continued as president. The\r\nassociation co-operated with the National American Suffrage\r\nAssociation in requesting the National Republican Committee, which met\r\nin Chicago, to incorporate a woman suffrage plank in its platform. An\r\nactive educational campaign was started to appeal again for Municipal\r\nsuffrage for women in another charter which was being prepared. This\r\ntime the charter convention acceded to the request of the women, but\r\nthe whole was defeated at Springfield. In this work important help was\r\ngiven the association by the Teachers' Federation, the Chicago Woman's\r\nClub and the Trade Union League. The Chicago Political Equality\r\nLeague, as well as other affiliated suffrage organizations, took an\r\nactive part in this campaign and about 60,000 signatures to a petition\r\nwere obtained.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1909, the State convention was held in Chicago and Mrs.\r\nStewart was again re-elected. This year the State association\r\norganized the Chicago Men's Equal Suffrage League with former Senator\r\nThomas J. McMillan, the \"father\" of the Illinois School suffrage law,\r\nas its first president. The members were from many walks of life,\r\namong them George E. Cole, founder of the Citizens' Association, who\r\nhad led in civic reform work for many years; Bishop Samuel Fallows,\r\none of the city's most prominent and best loved clergymen; Richard S.\r\nTuthill, for years an influential Judge; Jenkin Lloyd Jones, founder\r\nof the liberal church known as Lincoln Center; Dr. Henry B. Favill,\r\none of Chicago's well-known physicians; Henry Neil, who was\r\nresponsible for the mothers' pension law; Andrew MacLeish, a member of\r\nCarson, Pirie, Scott & Company, one of the city's largest dry goods\r\nhouses, and many other prominent men, including the husbands of all\r\nthe well-known suffragists. This year for the first time permanent\r\nheadquarters were opened in the Fine Arts Building, 410 Michigan\r\nBoulevard, and Miss Harriet Grim, a student of Chicago University, was\r\nengaged as State organizer. She spoke before women's clubs, labor\r\nunions and parlor groups and twenty new societies were formed. Active\r\nsuffrage work was also instituted among the churches under the\r\nmanagement of Mrs. Fannie H. Rastall, chairman of the Church\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1910 the State Board decided to try suffrage\r\nautomobile tours. Mrs. Grace Wilbur Trout, president of the Chicago\r\nPolitical Equality League, was appointed to take charge of an\r\nexperimental tour which required about six weeks of preparatory work\r\nto insure its success. She visited the offices of the newspapers and\r\nsecured their co-operation. The tour started on Monday, July 11, and\r\nthe edition of the _Tribune_ the day before contained a full colored\r\npage of the women in the autos and nearly a half page more of reading\r\nmaterial about it. The paper sent two reporters on the trip, who rode\r\nin the car with the speakers. The _Examiner_, _Record Herald_, _Post_\r\nand _Journal_ sent reporters by railroad and trolley, who joined the\r\nsuffragists at their stopping places. The women spoke from the\r\nautomobile, which drove into some square or stopped on a prominent\r\nstreet corner, previously arranged for by the local committees. Mrs.\r\nMcCulloch spoke from the legal standpoint; Miss Nicholes from the\r\nlaboring woman's view and Mrs. Stewart from an international aspect.\r\nMrs. Trout made the opening address, covering the subject in a general\r\nway, and presented the speakers. She herself was introduced by some\r\nprominent local woman and on several occasions by the Mayor.\r\n\r\nSixteen towns were visited, and the _Tribune_ said: \"Suffrage tour\r\nends in triumph. With mud bespattered 'Votes for Women' banners still\r\nflying, Mrs. Trout and her party of orators returned late yesterday\r\nafternoon. Men and women cheered them all the way in from their last\r\nstop at Wheaton to the Fine Arts Building headquarters.\" Similar tours\r\nin other parts of the State were conducted by Dr. Anna E. Blount, Mrs.\r\nStewart, Miss Grim and Mrs. Jennie F. W. Johnson. Mrs. Trout took her\r\nsame speakers and went to Lake Geneva, where meetings with speaking\r\nfrom automobiles were held under the auspices of Mrs. Willis S.\r\nMcCrea, who entertained the suffragists in her spacious summer home.\r\nIn the autumn at her house on Lincoln Parkway Mrs. McCrea organized\r\nthe North Side Branch of the State association, afterwards (1913)\r\nrenamed the Chicago Equal Suffrage Association.\r\n\r\nIn October the State convention was held at Elgin and Mrs. Stewart was\r\nre-elected. The Municipal and Presidential bills and the full suffrage\r\namendment were introduced in the Legislature as usual. Miss Grim and\r\nMiss Ruth Harl were stationed at Springfield as permanent lobbyists\r\nand Mrs. McCulloch directed the work. At the time of the hearing a\r\nspecial suffrage train was run from Chicago to Springfield, with\r\nspeaking from the rear platform at the principal places en route.\r\n\r\nThe State convention was held at Decatur in October, 1911, and Mrs.\r\nStewart, wishing to retire from office after serving six strenuous\r\nyears, Mrs. Elvira Downey was elected president. Organizing work was\r\npushed throughout the State. Cook county clubs for political\r\ndiscussion were formed by Miss Mary Miller, a lawyer of Chicago. In\r\nthe winter a suffrage bazaar lasting five days was held at the Hotel\r\nLaSalle, under the management of Mrs. Alice Bright Parker. Many of the\r\nyounger suffragists took part in this social event. Every afternoon\r\nand evening there were suffrage speeches and several Grand Opera\r\nsingers contributed their services. It was an excellent piece of\r\npropaganda work and aroused interest among people who had not been\r\nreached through other forms.\r\n\r\nAt the April primaries in Chicago in 1912, through the initiative of\r\nMrs. McCulloch, a \"preferential\" ballot on the question of suffrage\r\nfor women was taken. This was merely an expression of opinion by the\r\nvoters as to whether they favored it, which the Democratic Judge of\r\nElections, John E. Owens, allowed to be taken, but it had no legal\r\nstanding. The State association conducted a whirlwind educational\r\ncampaign immediately before the election. Unfortunately,\r\nProhibitionists, Socialists and many independent electors who favored\r\nit were not entitled to vote. The result was 135,410 noes, 71,354\r\nayes, every ward giving an adverse majority. In October the State\r\nconvention was held at Galesburg and Mrs. Grace Wilbur Trout was\r\nelected president. Mrs. Trout had been on the State board for two\r\nyears and during this time had served also as president of the Chicago\r\nPolitical Equality League, which under her administration had\r\nincreased its membership from 143 to over 1,000 members. She began at\r\nonce to strengthen the State organization for the legislative campaign\r\nof 1913. There were still Senatorial districts in which there were no\r\nsuffrage societies, and, as the time was short, competent women were\r\nimmediately appointed in such districts to see that their legislators\r\nwere interviewed and to make ready to have letters and telegrams sent\r\nto them at Springfield.\r\n\r\nDuring the Legislature of 1911 Mrs. Trout had twice accompanied Mrs.\r\nMcCulloch to Springfield and the antagonism manifested against woman\r\nsuffrage made her realize that new tactics would have to be employed.\r\nMrs. McCulloch after many years of service had asked to be relieved\r\nand Mrs. Elizabeth K. Booth of Glencoe had been elected legislative\r\nchairman. Mrs. Trout and she adopted a new plan without spectacular\r\nactivities of any kind, believing that much publicity was likely to\r\narouse the opponents. It was decided to initiate a quiet, educational\r\ncampaign and as the only possible way to secure sufficient votes to\r\npass the measure, to convert some of the opponents into friends. It\r\nwas agreed also that a card index, giving data about every member of\r\nthe Legislature, should be compiled at once to be used later for\r\nreference. This plan was approved and adopted by the State board.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Board and suffrage friends throughout the State\r\ngathered information about the legislators and sent it to Mrs. Booth.\r\nThe cards when filled out stated the politics and religion of the\r\nvarious Senators and Representatives, whether they were married or\r\nsingle, whether their home relations were harmonious, and tabulated\r\nany public service they had ever rendered. This information made it\r\neasier to approach the different legislators in a way to overcome\r\ntheir individual prejudices. All effort was to be concentrated on the\r\nbill, which, with variations, the State association had had before\r\nmost of the Legislatures since 1893. It read as follows:\r\n\r\n     All women [naming usual qualifications] shall be allowed to vote\r\n     for presidential electors, members of the State Board of\r\n     Equalization, clerk of the appellate court, county collector,\r\n     county surveyor, members of board of assessors, members of board\r\n     of review, sanitary district trustees, and for all officers of\r\n     cities, villages and towns (except police magistrates), and upon\r\n     all questions or propositions submitted to a vote of the electors\r\n     of such municipalities or other political division of this State.\r\n\r\n     All such women may also vote for the following township officers:\r\n     supervisor, town clerk, assessor, collector and highway\r\n     commissioner, and may also participate and vote in all annual and\r\n     special town meetings in the township in which such election\r\n     district shall be.\r\n\r\n     Separate ballot boxes and ballots shall be provided....\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Legislature convened in 1913 a struggle developed over\r\nthe Speakership, and there was a long and bitter deadlock before\r\nWilliam McKinley, a young Democrat from Chicago, was finally elected.\r\nThen another struggle ensued over a United States Senator. During\r\nthese weeks of turmoil little could be accomplished for the suffrage\r\nbill, but February 10 Mrs. Booth went to Springfield and from then\r\nattended the sessions regularly. She sat in the galleries of the\r\nSenate and House and soon learned to recognize each member and rounded\r\nup and checked off friendly legislators.\r\n\r\nThe Progressives had a large representation and had made plans to\r\nintroduce as a party measure a carefully drafted Woman Suffrage bill.\r\nMrs. Trout and Mrs. Booth suggested to the leaders that it would be\r\nfar better to let the State association sponsor this measure than to\r\nhave it presented by any political party. They finally agreed, but\r\nMrs. McCulloch had accompanied Mrs. Booth to Springfield taking the\r\nbill which she herself had drafted and which she insisted upon having\r\nsubstituted. Out of deference to her long years of service her bill\r\nwas taken instead of the Progressives'. It named the officers for\r\nwhich women should be allowed to vote instead of being worded like the\r\nProgressive draft, which said: \"Women shall be allowed to vote for all\r\nofficers and upon all propositions submitted except where the\r\nConstitution provides that the elector shall be a male citizen.\" In\r\nMrs. Booth's official report to the State convention, held in the fall\r\nof 1913 at Peoria, she said: \"As we failed to introduce the form of\r\nbill approved by the Progressives' constitutional lawyers they\r\nintroduced it, and it required considerable tact to allay their\r\ndispleasure and induce them to support our bill.\" Medill McCormick,\r\none of the leading Progressives in the Legislature, helped greatly in\r\nstraightening out this tangle. He was a faithful ally of the suffrage\r\nlobby and rendered invaluable assistance. Other Progressives who gave\r\nimportant service were John M. Curran and Emil N. Zolla of Chicago; J.\r\nH. Jayne of Monmouth; Charles H. Carmon of Forrest, and Fayette S.\r\nMunro of Highland Park.[43]\r\n\r\nOn March 10 Mrs. Trout went to Springfield to secure if possible the\r\nsupport of the Democratic Governor, Edward F. Dunne, for the bill.\r\nMrs. Booth said in her official report: \"The Governor told us that he\r\nwould not support any suffrage measure which provided for a\r\nconstitutional amendment, as this might interfere with the Initiative\r\nand Referendum Amendment, upon which the administration was\r\nconcentrating its efforts. We assured him that we would not introduce\r\na resolution for an amendment and that we desired the support of the\r\nadministration for our statutory bill, as we realized that no suffrage\r\nmeasure could pass if it opposed. He then acquiesced.\" The work at\r\nSpringfield became more and more complicated and at times seemed\r\nalmost hopeless. No politicians believed the suffragists had the\r\nslightest chance of success. From April 7 Mrs. Trout went down every\r\nweek. The women had the strong support of the Chicago press and\r\neditorials were published whenever they were especially needed during\r\nthe six months' struggle. After considerable educational work the\r\nSpringfield newspapers also became friendly and published suffrage\r\neditorials at opportune times. The papers were refolded so that these\r\neditorials, blue penciled, came on the outside, and placed on the\r\ndesks of the legislators.\r\n\r\nThe bill was introduced in the House by Charles L. Scott (Dem.) and in\r\nthe Senate by Hugh S. Magill (Rep.). All efforts were centered on its\r\npassage first through the Senate. After nearly three months of\r\nstrenuous effort this was finally accomplished on May 7, 1913, by a\r\nvote of 29 ayes (three more than the required majority) and 15 noes.\r\nIt is doubtful whether this action could have been secured without the\r\nskilful tactics of Senator Magill, but he could not have succeeded\r\nwithout the unfailing co-operation of Lieutenant Governor Barratt\r\nO'Hara. Among other Senators who helped were Martin B. Bailey, Albert\r\nC. Clark, Edward C. Curtis, Samuel A. Ettelson, Logan Hay and Thomas\r\nB. Stewart, Republicans; Michael H. Cleary, William A. Compton, Kent\r\nE. Keller, Walter I. Manny and W. Duff Piercy, Democrats; George W.\r\nHarris and Walter Clyde Jones, Progressives.\r\n\r\nThe day the bill passed Mrs. Trout left Springfield to address a\r\nsuffrage meeting to be held in Galesburg that evening and the next day\r\none at Monmouth. In each place resided a member of the House who was\r\nmarked on the card index as \"doubtful,\" but both, through the\r\ninfluence of their constituents, voted for the bill. Mrs. Booth\r\nremained in Springfield to see that it got safely over to the House.\r\nThe two women wished the bill to go into the friendly Elections\r\nCommittee and the opponents were planning to put it into the Judiciary\r\nCommittee, where it would remain during the rest of the session. The\r\nsuffrage lobby worked into the small hours of the night making plans\r\nto frustrate this scheme. Arrangements were made with Speaker McKinley\r\nto turn it over to the Elections Committee, and when the morning\r\nsession opened this was done before the opponents realized that their\r\nplot had failed.\r\n\r\nThe women were indebted to David R. Shanahan, for many years an\r\ninfluential Republican member, who, representing a \"wet\" district in\r\nChicago, felt that he could not vote for the bill, but without his\r\ncounsel it would have been still more difficult to pass it. To\r\novercome the pitfalls, Mrs. Trout appealed to the enemies to give the\r\nwomen of Illinois a square deal, especially to Lee O'Neil Browne, a\r\npowerful Democratic leader. He had always opposed suffrage\r\nlegislation, but he finally consented to let the bill, so far as he\r\nwas concerned, be voted up or down on its merits. It was this spirit\r\nof fair play among its opponents as well as the loyalty of its friends\r\nthat made possible the final victory.\r\n\r\nUp to this time Mrs. Trout and Mrs. Booth had worked alone, but now\r\nMrs. Trout asked Mrs. Antoinette Funk, a lawyer, of Chicago, who had\r\ndone active work for the Progressive party, to come to Springfield,\r\nand she arrived on May 13. A week later Mrs. Medill McCormick came to\r\nreside in the capital and her services were immediately enlisted. She\r\nwas a daughter of the late Senator Mark Hanna, who had inherited much\r\nof her father's ability in politics and was an important addition to\r\nthe suffrage lobby. On May 14 the bill had its first reading and was\r\nreferred to the Elections Committee. On the 21st it was reported with\r\na recommendation that it \"do pass.\" The opponents were now thoroughly\r\nalarmed. Anton J. Cermak of Chicago, president of the United\r\nSocieties, a powerful organization of liquor interests, directed the\r\nfight against it. Leaflets were circulated giving the \"preferential\"\r\nsuffrage vote taken in Chicago the year before, with a list of the\r\nnegative votes cast in each ward to show the Chicago members how badly\r\nit had been beaten by their constituents. The bill was called up for\r\nsecond reading June 3 and there was a desperate attempt to amend and\r\nif possible kill it, but it finally passed in just the form it had\r\ncome over from the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe hope of the opposition now was to keep Speaker McKinley from\r\nallowing the bill to come up for third reading. He told Mrs. Trout\r\nthat hundreds of men from Chicago as well as from other parts of the\r\nState had come to Springfield and begged him to prevent it from coming\r\nto a vote. The young Speaker looked haggard and worn during those\r\ndays, and he asked her to let him know it if there was any suffrage\r\nsentiment in the State. She immediately telephoned to Mrs. Harriette\r\nTaylor Treadwell, president of the Chicago Political Equality League,\r\nto have letters and telegrams sent at once to Springfield and to have\r\npeople communicate by telephone with the Speaker when he returned to\r\nChicago for the week end. Mrs. Treadwell called upon the suffragists\r\nand thousands of letters and telegrams were sent. She also organized a\r\ntelephone brigade by means of which he was called up every fifteen\r\nminutes by men as well as women, both at his home and his office, from\r\nearly Saturday morning until late Monday night the days he spent in\r\nChicago. She was assisted in this work by Mrs. James W. Morrisson,\r\nsecretary of the Chicago Equal Suffrage Association; Mrs. George Bass,\r\npresident of the Chicago Woman's Club; Mrs. Jean Wallace Butler, a\r\nwell-known business woman; Mrs. Edward L. Stillman, an active\r\nsuffragist in the Rogers Park Woman's Club; Miss Florence King, a\r\nprominent patent lawyer and president of the Chicago Woman's\r\nAssociation of Commerce; Miss Mary Miller, another Chicago lawyer and\r\npresident of the Chicago Human Rights Association; Mrs. Charlotte\r\nRhodus, president of the Woman Suffrage Party of Cook County and other\r\ninfluential women. Mrs. Trout telephoned Miss Margaret Dobyne, press\r\nchairman of the association, to send out the call for help over the\r\nState, which she did with the assistance of Miss Jennie F. W. Johnson,\r\nthe treasurer, and Mrs. J. W. McGraw, the auditor.\r\n\r\nA deluge of letters and telegrams from every section of Illinois\r\nawaited the Speaker when he arrived in Springfield Tuesday morning. He\r\nneeded no further proof and announced that the bill would be called up\r\nfor final action June 11. The women in charge of it immediately began\r\nto marshal their forces for the last struggle. Messages were sent to\r\neach friend of the measure in the House, urging him to be present\r\nwithout fail.[44] On the eventful morning there was much excitement at\r\nthe Capitol. The \"captains,\" previously requested to be on hand\r\nearly, reported if any of their men were missing, these were at once\r\ncalled up by telephone and when necessary a cab was sent for them. The\r\nfour women lobbyists were stationed as follows: Mrs. Booth and Mrs.\r\nMcCormick in the gallery; Mrs. Trout at the only entrance of the House\r\nleft open that day, and Mrs. Funk to carry messages and instructions\r\nbetween these points. Mrs. Booth checked off the votes and Mrs. Trout\r\nstood guard to see that no friendly members left the House during roll\r\ncalls and also to prevent the violation of the law which forbade any\r\nlobbyist to enter the floor of the House after the session had\r\nconvened. The burly doorkeeper, who was against the suffrage bill,\r\ncould not be trusted to enforce the law if its enemies chose to enter.\r\n\r\nEvents proved the wisdom of this precaution. A number of favoring\r\nlegislators who started to leave the House during the fight were\r\npersuaded to return and the doorkeeper soon told Mrs. Trout she would\r\nhave to go into the gallery. As she did not move he came back\r\npresently and said that Benjamin Mitchell, one of the members of the\r\nHouse leading the opposition, had instructed him that if she did not\r\nimmediately go to the gallery he would put a resolution through the\r\nHouse forcing her to do so. She politely but firmly said it was her\r\nright as a citizen of Illinois to stay in the corridor and remained at\r\nher post. As a consequence no one entered the House that day who was\r\nnot legally entitled to do so. During the five hours' debate all known\r\nparliamentary tactics were used to defeat the bill. When Speaker\r\nMcKinley finally announced the vote--ayes 83 (six more than the\r\nrequired majority), noes 58--a hush fell for an instant before the\r\nwild outburst of applause. It seemed as if there had passed through\r\nthose legislative halls the spirit of eternal justice and truth and\r\nthe eyes of strong men filled with tears.\r\n\r\nPoliticians declared it was a miracle, but it was a miracle made\r\npossible by six months of unceasing toil, during which the suffrage\r\nlobby worked from early in the morning until late at night and were\r\nshadowed by detectives eager to acquire testimony that would prejudice\r\nthe legislators against their measure. It was most encouraging to the\r\nworkers when they won over Edward D. Shurtleff, who had been for years\r\nSpeaker of the House and was acknowledged to be one of the most\r\nastute men in Springfield. His practical knowledge of legislative\r\nprocedure made his advice of the greatest value. Representative Scott,\r\nwho introduced the bill in the House, was a highly esteemed member who\r\nrefused to present any others so that he could be free to devote all\r\nof his time and energy to this one, and others were equally loyal.\r\nMrs. Trout's leadership received the highest praise from the press and\r\nthe politicians of the State. The Illinois Legislature led the way and\r\nwithin a few years bills of a similar nature had been passed by those\r\nof fourteen other States.\r\n\r\nThe State Equal Suffrage Association tendered a banquet at the Leland\r\nHotel in Springfield on June 13 to the legislators and their wives,\r\nopponents as well as friends, and prominent suffragists came from over\r\nthe State. Mrs. Trout asked Mrs. McCormick to take charge of the\r\nbanquet and she had a roll of honor printed which the men who voted\r\nfor the suffrage bill were invited to sign, and the Governor's\r\nsignature was also obtained. As soon as he entered the banquet hall\r\nMrs. Trout, in charge of the program, called upon the banqueters to\r\nrise and do honor to the Governor who would soon, by signing the\r\nsuffrage bill, win the everlasting gratitude of all men and women in\r\nIllinois interested in human liberty. The very day the bill passed the\r\nHouse a committee of anti-suffrage legislators called upon Governor\r\nDunne to urge him to veto it and tried to influence Attorney General\r\nPatrick J. Lucey to declare it unconstitutional, which would give him\r\nan excuse. Mrs. McCormick immediately went to Chicago and secured\r\nopinions from able lawyers that the bill was constitutional, and he\r\nstood out against all opposition and signed it on June 26.\r\n\r\nOn July 1 a jubilee automobile parade was arranged by Mrs. Treadwell\r\nwith Mrs. Kenneth McLennan as grand marshal, and the cars filled with\r\nenthusiastic suffragists extended several miles down Michigan\r\nBoulevard. The first important work was to arouse the women of the\r\nState to a realization of all the good that could be accomplished by\r\nthe wise use of the franchise. The entire cost of the Springfield\r\ncampaign, which lasted over six months and included railroad fare for\r\nthe lobbyists, innumerable telegrams and long distance telephone\r\ncalls, postage, stationery, printing, stenographic help, hotel bills\r\nand incidentals, was only $1,567, but it left the treasury of the\r\nassociation empty. The board therefore gratefully accepted the offer\r\nof William Randolph Hearst of a suffrage edition of the Chicago\r\n_Examiner_. He agreed to pay for the cost of publication and permit\r\nthe funds raised through the sale of the papers and the advertising to\r\ngo into the suffrage treasury. The women were weary from the campaign\r\nand most of the board were going away for the summer but Mrs. Trout\r\nrallied her forces, was general manager herself and persuaded Mrs.\r\nFunk to be managing editor, Miss Dobyne advertising manager and Mrs.\r\nTreadwell circulation manager. As a result of almost six weeks' work\r\nduring the hottest part of the summer nearly $15,000 were raised.\r\nAfter all commissions and other expenses were paid and new and\r\ncommodious suffrage headquarters in the Tower Building were furnished\r\na fund of between $7,000 and $8,000 was left to maintain them and push\r\norganization work.\r\n\r\nThe constitutionality of the law was soon attacked and Mrs. Trout\r\nconsulted frequently with the officers of the Anti-Saloon League, for\r\nthe attacks always emanated from the \"wet\" interests, and most\r\nefficient service was rendered by F. Scott McBride, State\r\nSuperintendent; E. J. Davis, Chicago superintendent, and Frank B.\r\nEbbert, legal counsel for the league, who said it was also their\r\nfight. A case was brought against the Election Commissioners of\r\nChicago for allowing women to vote on certain questions, decided in\r\ntheir favor by the lower courts, appealed and brought before the\r\nSupreme Court of Illinois. A meeting of the board of the State Equal\r\nSuffrage Association was called at once, which voted to raise a\r\ndefense fund and fight the case to a finish. The chairman of the\r\ncommittee was Mrs. George A. Soden, first vice-president, and it was\r\nlargely through her efforts and the contributions of her husband that\r\nthe fund was raised. Not only the legislators who had voted for the\r\nbill but also a number who voted against it sent money to help defend\r\nthe law. The opponents of the law--the liquor interests--were\r\nrepresented by Levi Mayer of Chicago, counsel for the United Societies\r\nas well as for big brewery interests and considered one of the ablest\r\nconstitutional lawyers in the State. It was therefore necessary for\r\nthe association to secure the best and they engaged John J. Herrick\r\nand Judge Charles S. Cutting, who by agreement with the Election\r\nCommissioners took charge of the fight. The women consulted also with\r\nCharles H. Mitchell, their regular counsel, as well as with Judge\r\nWillard McEwen, whom the commissioners engaged as special counsel.\r\nThey frequently conferred with Judge Isaiah T. Greenacre, counsel for\r\nthe Teachers' Federation, and Joel F. Longnecker, a young lawyer\r\nactive in the Progressive party, both of whom donated their services.\r\n\r\nThere was a long delay in the Supreme Court and during this time it\r\nwas vitally necessary to demonstrate that the women wanted the ballot\r\nby bringing out as large a registration as possible for the municipal\r\nelection to be held in April, 1914. The opponents were saying: \"Women\r\ndown the State have voted because they are interested in local option\r\nbut not 25,000 women will register in Chicago.\" It was, therefore, of\r\nparamount importance to arouse the Chicago women. This work was in\r\ncharge of Mrs. Edward L. Stewart, assisted by Mrs. Judith Weil\r\nLoewenthal, members of the State Board. Mrs. Stewart called upon every\r\norganization of women in the city to assist. Valuable help was given\r\nby Mrs. Ida Darling Engelke, city chairman of ward organization for\r\nthe Chicago Political Equality League; Mrs. Joseph T. Bowen, president\r\nof the Woman's City Club, and Mrs. James Morrisson, president of the\r\nChicago Equal Suffrage Association. There were public meetings in\r\nevery ward, and a mass meeting the Sunday before the election in the\r\nAuditorium Theater, which seated over 4,000 people, but overflow\r\nmeetings were necessary. As a result of this united effort over\r\n200,000 women registered in Chicago alone and thousands more\r\nthroughout the State.\r\n\r\nOn May 2, 1914, was held the first large suffrage parade in Illinois.\r\nIt was managed by the State association and its affiliated Chicago\r\nclubs. Mrs. Trout, with the members of the Board and distinguished\r\npioneer suffragists, led the procession, and Governor Dunne and Mayor\r\nCarter H. Harrison reviewed it. The city government sent to head the\r\nparade the mounted police, led by Chief Gleason, called \"the beauty\r\nsquad,\" only brought out on very special occasions. Nearly 15,000\r\nwomen, representing all parties, creeds and classes, marched down\r\nMichigan Boulevard and hundreds of thousands of people lined both\r\nsides for over two miles. Captain Charles W. Kayser of Wheaton planned\r\nthe procession with military skill. The Parade Committee, including\r\nthe heads of divisions and numbering over a thousand women, was\r\ninvited immediately after the procession to the Hotel La Salle by\r\nErnest Stevens, manager and one of the owners, where they were guests\r\nof the management at supper, which was followed by music and speaking.\r\n\r\nIn June the General Federation of Women's Clubs held its biennial\r\nconvention in Chicago and the question uppermost in the minds of all\r\nclub women was, would the president, Mrs. Percy Pennybacker, refuse to\r\nallow a woman suffrage resolution to be presented, as her predecessor,\r\nMrs. Philip Moore, had done in San Francisco at the preceding\r\nbiennial, and also would it receive a favorable vote if presented? The\r\nState Board, realizing that with the suffrage law still hanging in the\r\nbalance in the Supreme Court, it was vitally important to have the\r\nendorsement by this convention, representing 1,500,000 members,\r\nappointed Mrs. Trout to secure favorable action if possible. The\r\nFederation Board on request of Mrs. Pennybacker appointed a special\r\ncommittee to confer with her and as the result of co-operation the\r\nfollowing resolution, presented by Mrs. Lucretia L. Blankenburg of\r\nPhiladelphia, an officer of the Federation, was adopted on June 13:\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, the question of the political equality of men and women\r\n     is today a vital problem under discussion throughout the\r\n     civilized world, therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, that the General Federation of Women's Clubs give the\r\n     cause of political equality for men and women its moral support\r\n     by recording its earnest belief in the principle of political\r\n     equality regardless of sex.\r\n\r\nThere were between 1,700 and 1,800 delegates present, representing all\r\nsections of the country. The vote was viva voce and so overwhelmingly\r\nin the affirmative that it was not counted. The Chicago _Tribune_\r\nsaid: \"The anti-suffragists made no fight against the resolution on\r\nthe floor of the convention, probably realizing they were hopelessly\r\noutnumbered. There was a considerable chorus of nays when it was put,\r\nbut not enough for any one to demand a count.\" Afterwards the\r\nIllinois members recommended Mrs. Trout as an honorary member of the\r\nGeneral Federation and she was unanimously elected.\r\n\r\nBy an interesting coincidence the day the suffrage resolution was\r\npassed by the Biennial the State Supreme Court pronounced the Suffrage\r\nLaw constitutional. A banquet had already been planned by the State\r\nassociation for that evening to be held in the Gold Room of the\r\nCongress Hotel in honor of the General Federation, and it proved to be\r\na memorable occasion. Over a thousand women were present and nearly as\r\nmany more could not find room. Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, Miss Mary\r\nGarrett Hay and other well known suffragists, as well as the officers\r\nof the Federation, made speeches.\r\n\r\nAll these events changed public sentiment in regard to the woman\r\nsuffrage question. As Congress was in session this summer its members\r\nwere unable to fill their Chautauqua lecture dates, and Mrs. Trout was\r\nasked to make suffrage speeches at fifty Chautauquas in nine States,\r\nfilling dates for a Democrat, the Hon. Champ Clark, and for a\r\nRepublican, United States Senator Robert LaFollette, and for William\r\nJennings Bryan.\r\n\r\nThe State convention was held in Chicago in 1914 and Mrs. Trout was\r\nagain re-elected president. During this year the Chicago Equal\r\nSuffrage Association did excellent educational work by establishing\r\nclasses in citizenship in the Woman's City Club and by publishing\r\ncatechisms for women voters in seven different languages.\r\n\r\nAt the annual convention held in Peoria in 1915 Mrs. Trout positively\r\nrefused to stand again for president and Mrs. Adella Maxwell Brown of\r\nPeoria was elected. Four State conferences were held during the year\r\nand Mrs. Brown represented the association at the National Suffrage\r\nAssociation at Washington in December; the Mississippi Valley\r\nConference at Minneapolis the next May; the National Council of Women\r\nVoters at Cheyenne in July and the National Suffrage Association at\r\nAtlantic City in September. In June, 1916, the State association,\r\nassisted by those of Chicago, took charge of what became known as the\r\n\"famous rainy day suffrage parade,\" held in that city while the\r\nNational Republican convention was in session. Mrs. Brown was\r\nchairman of the committee, Mrs. Morrisson vice-chairman and Mrs.\r\nKellogg Fairbanks grand marshal of the parade.\r\n\r\nThere was much speculation among the political parties as to how the\r\nwomen would vote at their first presidential election in November,\r\n1916. As their ballots were put into separate boxes they could be\r\ndistinguished and they were as follows: Republican, 459,215;\r\nDemocratic, 383,292; Socialist, 17,175; Prohibition, 16,212; Socialist\r\nLabor, 806.\r\n\r\nMuch important legislative work was to be done in the next session of\r\nthe Legislature and at the State convention held in Springfield in\r\nOctober, 1916, Mrs. Trout was persuaded to accept again the\r\npresidency. Delegates were present from every section and the policy\r\nfor the ensuing year was thoroughly discussed by Mrs. McCulloch,\r\nSenator Magill, Lewis G. Stevenson, Secretary of State; Mrs. George\r\nBass, and others. The consensus of opinion was that owing to the great\r\ndifficulty of amending the State constitution the only practical way\r\nto secure full suffrage for women was through a new constitution. This\r\nconvention, therefore, voted in an overwhelming majority to work in\r\nthe Legislature of 1917 for the calling of a constitutional\r\nconvention. The Citizens' Association, composed of leading men of\r\nChicago and the State, had been trying over thirty years to obtain a\r\nnew State constitution and as soon as they learned of this action they\r\nsent Shelby M. Singleton, its secretary, to request of Mrs. Trout and\r\nMrs. McGraw that the work be directed by the leaders of the State\r\nEqual Suffrage Association, to which they agreed. They went to\r\nSpringfield at the beginning of the session in 1917 and a struggle\r\nfollowed that lasted over ten weeks.\r\n\r\n[Mrs. McGraw prepared a very full account of the work in the\r\nLegislature to have it submit to the voters the question of calling a\r\nconvention to prepare a new constitution. Representatives of all the\r\nleading organizations of women assisted at Springfield from time to\r\ntime. The resolution had the powerful support of Governor Frank C.\r\nLowden, Congressman Medill McCormick, Roger C. Sullivan and other\r\nprominent men, but the Citizens' Association in an official bulletin\r\ngave the larger part of the credit to \"the tireless and tactful work\r\nof the women's lobby.\" After Senate and House by more than a\r\ntwo-thirds majority had voted to submit the question to the voters\r\nthe State association organized an Emergency League to establish\r\ncenters in each of the 101 counties and an immense educational\r\ncampaign was carried on. Over a thousand meetings were held in the\r\nsummer and fall preceding the election Nov. 5, 1918, when the proposal\r\nfor a convention received a majority of 74,239. The next year\r\ndelegates to the convention were elected and it met in Springfield\r\nJan. 6, 1920. One of its first acts was to adopt an article giving the\r\ncomplete suffrage to women. Before the constitution was ready to\r\nsubmit to the voters the women were fully enfranchised by the Federal\r\nAmendment.]\r\n\r\nAfter the victory was gained in the Legislature and just as all plans\r\nwere laid for the campaign in the spring of 1917 the United States\r\nentered the war against Germany. Mrs. Trout was appointed a member of\r\nthe executive committee of the Woman's Council of National Defense and\r\nall the members of the board immediately engaged in Liberty Loan, Red\r\nCross and other war work. During this period of strenuous activity\r\nanother attack was made on the constitutionality of the suffrage law\r\nby the liquor interests and the case was again brought before the\r\nSupreme Court. The State Board engaged James G. Skinner, an able\r\nlawyer, formerly Assistant Corporation Counsel, and in December the\r\nlaw was again pronounced constitutional.\r\n\r\nThe State convention was held in the autumn of 1917 in Danville and\r\nMrs. Trout was re-elected. The association now had affiliated\r\nsocieties in every senatorial and congressional district with a\r\nmembership of over 200,000 women. Mrs. Trout was soon called to\r\nWashington by Mrs. Catt to work for the Federal Suffrage Amendment and\r\nspent many months there while Mrs. McGraw directed the organization\r\nwork of the State association. She secured the co-operation of Mrs. R.\r\nM. Reed, legislative chairman of the Illinois Federation of Women's\r\nClubs; they appointed two workers in each congressional district and\r\nnearly every woman's society in the State had constitutional\r\nconvention programs. In the spring of 1918 Governor Lowden appointed\r\nJudge Orrin N. Carter, of the Supreme Court, chairman of a state-wide\r\ncommittee that worked in co-operation with the state-wide committee of\r\nwomen. The annual suffrage convention was held in the latter part of\r\nOctober, 1918, in Chicago, and Mrs. Trout was re-elected.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. When Congress submitted the Federal Suffrage Amendment\r\nJune 4, 1919, Mrs. Trout and Mrs. McGraw immediately went to\r\nSpringfield where the Legislature was in session. They had already\r\nmade preliminary arrangements and without urging it ratified the\r\namendment on June 10. The vote in the Senate was unanimous, in the\r\nHouse it was 135 ayes, 85 Republicans, 50 Democrats; three nays, all\r\nDemocrats, Lee O'Neil Browne, John Griffin and Peter F. Smith. A minor\r\nmistake was made in the first certified copy of the resolution sent\r\nfrom the Secretary of State's office at Washington to the Governor of\r\nIllinois. To prevent the possibility of any legal quibbling Governor\r\nLowden telegraphed that office to send at once a corrected, certified\r\ncopy. This was done and the ratification was reaffirmed by the\r\nLegislature on June 17, the vote in the Senate again being unanimous\r\nand one Democrat, Charles F. Franz, added to the former three negative\r\nvotes in the House.\r\n\r\nOwing to a misunderstanding of the facts for a short time there was\r\nsome controversy as to whether Illinois was entitled to first place,\r\nas the Wisconsin Legislature ratified an hour later. Attorney General\r\nBrundage prepared a brief showing that the mistake in the first\r\ncertified copy did not affect the legality of the ratification on June\r\n10, as the mistake was made in copying the introductory resolution and\r\nnot in the amendment itself. This opinion was accepted in the\r\nSecretary of State's office at Washington. So Illinois, the first\r\nState east of the Mississippi River to grant suffrage to its women,\r\nwas the first to ratify the Federal Suffrage Amendment. In celebration\r\na jubilee banquet was held on June 24 at the Hotel LaSalle, Mrs. Trout\r\npresiding, with Governor and Mrs. Lowden the guests of honor. Among\r\nthe speakers were the Governor, prominent members of the State\r\nLegislature and the leading women suffragists.\r\n\r\nIn October the State convention was held in Chicago, with delegates\r\npresent from every section, and Mrs. Trout was re-elected president.\r\nIt was voted to continue to work for the speedy ratification of the\r\nFederal Suffrage Amendment in other States and if this was not\r\nobtained in 1920 to work for the full suffrage article in the new\r\nconstitution when it was submitted to the voters. At the convention of\r\nthe National American Association in St. Louis the preceding March the\r\nIllinois association had extended an invitation to hold the next one\r\nin Chicago, which was accepted. The State board called together\r\nrepresentatives from the principal organizations of women, which were\r\nappointed to take charge of different days of the convention and\r\nvarious phases of the work. Mrs. Trout and Mrs. McGraw were made\r\nchairman and vice-chairman of the committee; Mrs. Samuel Slade,\r\nrecording secretary, was appointed chairman of the Finance Committee,\r\nwhich raised the funds to defray all the expenses of this large\r\nconvention in February, 1920. [Full account in Chapter XIX, Volume V.]\r\n\r\nA meeting of the State Board was called and a committee formed to get\r\nas many women as possible to vote in November at the election for\r\nPresident. Mrs. Trout was elected State chairman, Mrs. McGraw\r\nvice-chairman, and Mrs. Albert Schweitzer, a member of the board, was\r\nappointed Chicago chairman. The Woman's City Club, of which Mrs.\r\nJoseph T. Bowen was president, took an active part in the campaign and\r\nwas the headquarters for the Chicago committee. In August in the midst\r\nof the campaign came the joyful news that the 36th State had ratified\r\nthe Federal Amendment. A call was issued for the State convention to\r\nbe held in Chicago October 7-9, when the Illinois Equal Suffrage\r\nAssociation, its work finished, disbanded, and its members formed a\r\nState League of Women Voters, with Mrs. H. W. Cheney of Chicago as\r\nchairman.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[42] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. J. W. McGraw,\r\neight years on the Board of Directors and six years Legislative\r\nChairman of the Illinois Equal Suffrage Association. She is under\r\nobligations for many of the facts relative to the campaign of 1913 to\r\nMrs. Grace Wilbur Trout, State president for seven years.\r\n\r\n[43] The State association always did everything possible to cooperate\r\nwith the National Suffrage Association. On March 1, headed by Mrs.\r\nTrout, 83 women left Chicago by special train for Washington. In the\r\nbig suffrage parade there on the 3rd they wore a uniform regalia of\r\ncap and baldric and were headed by a large band led by Mrs. George S.\r\nWells, a member of the State Board, as drum major. There was a woman\r\nout-rider, Mrs. W. H. Stewart, on a spirited horse. Mrs. Trout led,\r\ncarrying an American flag, and the Illinois banner was carried by\r\nRoyal N. Allen, a prominent member of the Progressive party and the\r\nrailroad official who had charge of the special train.\r\n\r\n[44] \"Captains\" had been appointed among the members and each\r\nfurnished with a list and it was his duty to see that the men on it\r\nwere in their seats whenever the bill was up for discussion. The\r\nfollowing Representatives served as \"captains\" and rendered important\r\nservice: William F. Burres, Norman G. Flagg, Edward D. Shurtleff,\r\nHomer J. Tice and George H. Wilson, Republicans; John P. Devine, Frank\r\nGillespie, William A. Hubbard, W. C. Kane, Charles L. Scott and\r\nFrancis E. Williamson, Democrats; Roy D. Hunt, J. H. Jayne, Medill\r\nMcCormick and Emil N. Zolla, Progressives; Seymour Stedman, Socialist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nINDIANA. PART I.[45]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Indiana was one of the first States in the Union to form a\r\nsuffrage association in 1851 there were long periods when it was\r\ninactive but there were others when it flourished. In 1851 a\r\nconstitution was adopted whose provisions for women were probably more\r\nliberal than existed in any other State and they did not feel a\r\npressure of unjust laws; co-education prevailed from an early date and\r\nall occupations were open to them. Thus they were not impelled by\r\npersonal grievances to keep up a continued fight for the suffrage.\r\nAfter 1900 there was a period of depression which the National\r\nAmerican Suffrage Association tried unsuccessfully to relieve. Finally\r\nin May, 1906, it called a convention to meet in Kokomo, where one of\r\nthe old societies had continued to maintain an organization, and\r\ndelegates were present from societies in Indianapolis, Logansport,\r\nTipton and Montpelier. Mrs. Harriet Taylor Upton, treasurer of the\r\nNational Association, presided and a good deal of interest was shown.\r\nThe following officers were elected: President, Mrs. Sarah Davis;\r\nfirst vice-president, Mrs. Laura Schofield; secretary, Mrs. E. M.\r\nWood, all of Kokomo; second vice-president, Mrs. Anna Dunn Noland,\r\nLogansport; treasurer, Mrs. Marion Harvey Barnard, Indianapolis;\r\nauditors, Mrs. Jane Pond, Montpelier, Judge Samuel Artman, Lebanon.\r\nThe association affiliated with the National body and always remained\r\nan auxiliary. Mrs. Davis left the State during this year and there\r\nseems to be no record of anything done by this board.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1908, Mrs. Upton wrote to Mrs. Noland begging her to call a\r\nconvention. Acting as president, secretary and treasurer and supplying\r\nthe funds from her own purse, Mrs. Noland sent hundreds of letters\r\nover the State asking for names of people interested in suffrage and\r\nfrom the names she formed committees to interest others. Her only\r\nassistant was her husband, Dr. J. F. Noland, who helped in leisure\r\nhours. In October the work of organization began by Mrs. Noland and\r\nMiss Pearl Penfield. A convention was called to meet in Logansport,\r\nMarch 16-17, 1909. Fifteen clubs had paid small dues but only seven\r\nsent delegates. It was welcomed by Mayor George P. McKee. Much\r\ninterest and a great deal of publicity resulted. The _Reporter_, a\r\nLogansport daily paper, published a suffrage edition March 17, one\r\npage edited by a committee from the association. Mrs. Ella S. Stewart\r\nof Chicago, Miss Harriet Noble of Indianapolis and Mrs. B. F. Perkins\r\nof Fort Wayne were the speakers. The following officers were elected:\r\nPresident, Mrs. Noland; first vice-president, Dr. Susan E. Collier,\r\nIndianapolis; second, Mrs. Mary Mitchner, Kokomo; corresponding\r\nsecretary, Mrs. Bessie Hughes, Logansport; recording secretary, Mrs.\r\nWood; treasurer, Mrs. Barnard; auditors re-elected; member National\r\nExecutive Committee, Mrs. Perkins. During the year Sullivan, Terre\r\nHaute, Amboy, Lafayette, Red Key and Ridgeville became auxiliaries.\r\nMrs. Antoinette D. Leach of Sullivan was made State organizer; Mrs.\r\nFlora T. Neff of Logansport chairman of literature.\r\n\r\nIn 1911 a resolution to amend the State constitution by striking out\r\nthe word \"male\" was presented to the Legislature, drafted by Mrs.\r\nLeach. It passed the House committee unanimously, went to third\r\nreading and was shelved because of a proposed plan for a new\r\nconstitution brought out by Governor Thomas R. Marshall. The Municipal\r\nLeague composed of the mayors and councilmen of all the cities in the\r\nState invited the Equal Suffrage Association to provide speakers for\r\nthe annual meeting at Crawfordsville June 20 and Mrs. Noland, Miss\r\nNoble and Mrs. Leach responded. They were courteously received and\r\nheard with much applause. The convention was not interested in woman\r\nsuffrage but the press gave much publicity. A State suffrage\r\nconvention was held at this time. In August a monthly journal called\r\nthe _Woman Citizen_ was established in Indianapolis by the association\r\nwith Mrs. Leach as editor, its columns open to all suffrage\r\norganizations, and published for two years. New Albany,\r\nJeffersonville, Markleville and Valparaiso clubs were added to the\r\nState association. The New Albany society was large and active and\r\ngave suffrage much prominence in southern Indiana. Mrs. Noland\r\nreported 5,000 letters sent out in 1911.\r\n\r\nOn June 28, 29, 1912, Logansport again entertained the State\r\nconvention. Mrs. Noland acted as publicity chairman. The Call was sent\r\nbroadcast; press notices in every daily and weekly paper; large\r\nposters put up at the cross roads in every county; banners stretched\r\nacross Broadway announcing the date. On the Saturday before the\r\nmeeting circulars announcing it and a parade were dropped over the\r\ncity from an air ship. Every business house was beautifully dressed in\r\nsuffrage colors. Mayor D. D. Fickle gave an address of welcome. The\r\nprincipal speaker was Dr. B. O. Aylesworth of Colorado. The parade was\r\nviewed by more than 50,000 people and Pathé made films of it. The\r\nconvention was widely noticed by the press. Eleven new societies were\r\nadded to the State association. Mrs. Noland was re-elected. Other\r\nofficers were: Mrs. O. P. Smith, Logansport; Mrs. Anna Cassangese, New\r\nAlbany; Mrs. Margaret Williamson, Red Key; Dr. Emma G. Holloway, North\r\nManchester, vice-presidents; secretary-treasurer, Mrs. Katharine\r\nHoffman, Logansport; member National Executive Committee, Mrs. Leach;\r\nstanding committees, Legislation, Mrs. Leach; Church, Mrs. Alice Judah\r\nClark, Vincennes; Endorsement, Mrs. Harriet Houser; Press, Mrs. Neff,\r\nboth of Logansport.\r\n\r\nA publicity campaign was begun. Billboards were covered with posters\r\nand barns, fences and stones along the country roadways were decorated\r\nwith \"Votes for Women.\" Free literature was distributed and handbills\r\nwere given out at every opportunity. Sunday afternoon meetings were\r\nheld in picture show halls in many towns. Booths were secured at\r\ncounty and street fairs. Tents were placed on Chautauqua grounds with\r\nspeakers and all kinds of suffrage supplies. This program was kept up\r\nuntil the World War called the women to other duties. The Gary Civic\r\nService League affiliated with the association and Mrs. Kate Wood Ray,\r\nits president, was made press chairman.\r\n\r\nOn Oct. 12-14, 1914, the annual convention was held in Logansport,\r\nwelcomed by Mayor Guthrie. Among the speakers were Judge S. T.\r\nMcConnell of Logansport and O. P. Smith, a State and national labor\r\nleader. Both had attended the meeting at Kokomo in 1906, since which\r\ntime Judge McConnell had been a legal adviser of the association. Mr.\r\nSmith was a member of the legislative advisory committee. Miss Laura\r\nClay of Kentucky, Dr. Frank Stockton of Bloomington and Miss Florence\r\nWattles of Kokomo were the principal speakers. Miss Clay was made an\r\nhonorary member. Mrs. Mary P. Flannegan, secretary-treasurer, was the\r\nonly new officer; new committee chairmen, Mrs. McConnell, Mrs. L. E.\r\nSellars, Mrs. E. B. De Vault, Miss Wattles. The secretary's report\r\nshowed 28 affiliated societies. It was voted to cooperate with the\r\nLegislative Council of Women and work for Presidential suffrage. Mrs.\r\nNoland, as chairman of the committee, was in Indianapolis from the\r\ntime the bill was introduced until the Assembly adjourned.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1915, Mrs. Noland went before the national convention of\r\nminers in Indianapolis and secured a unanimous resolution favoring\r\nState and national woman suffrage from the 1,600 delegates. In the\r\nsummer the State association sent Miss Wattles for two months'\r\nspeaking in the New Jersey and Pennsylvania suffrage campaigns. In\r\nJuly the Municipal League held its annual meeting in Logansport and\r\nthe association, again called upon for speakers, sent Mrs. Noland,\r\nMrs. Smith and Mrs. Sellars. The enthusiasm with which they were\r\nreceived and the discussion by the delegates which followed showed a\r\nmarked change since the meeting at Crawfordsville in 1911. At the\r\nState convention in the fall a committee was appointed for\r\ninterviewing candidates before the spring primaries, especially those\r\nfor Governor and members of the Legislature and Congress. Mrs. Ray,\r\nMrs. Leach and Mrs. Noland composed the committee.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1916 the question of a new State constitution was\r\nreferred to the voters and the association placed women at all polling\r\nplaces in the cities and large towns. In the small towns and country\r\nthe voters received literature and letters asking them to vote in\r\nfavor. It was lost but the work gave the women a new zeal and with the\r\nenlightenment of the voters the effort seemed more than worth while.\r\nAt the State meeting in October it was decided again to join hands\r\nwith the Legislative Council to work for a partial suffrage bill and\r\nto cooperate with the Woman's Franchise League in legislative work if\r\na mutual decision could be brought about. The association all over the\r\nState was very zealous in behalf of the bill and Mrs. Ray, Mrs. Noland\r\nand Mrs. Stimson worked continuously in the State House until the\r\nGovernor signed it on February 28.\r\n\r\nTo the Legislative Council of Women belongs much of the glory for the\r\nfinal suffrage victories in Indiana. Formed in 1914 to work with the\r\nLegislature it was composed of the following State organizations\r\nrepresenting 80,000 organized women: Federation of Women's Clubs,\r\nWoman's Christian Temperance Union, Mothers' Congress, Woman's\r\nFranchise League, Woman's Press Club, Association of Collegiate\r\nAlumnae, Consumers' League, Woman's Relief Corps, Equal Suffrage\r\nAssociation. These organizations represented an influence that could\r\nnot be ignored. The officers were as follows: President, Mrs. Felix T.\r\nMcWhirter (later Mrs. Edward F. White), Indianapolis; vice-presidents:\r\nMiss Vida Newsom, Columbus; Mrs. Flora Millspaugh, Chesterfield; Mrs.\r\nA. D. Moffett, Elwood; secretary-treasurer, Miss Dora Bosart,\r\nIndianapolis. The Executive Committee was composed of the president\r\nand one delegate from each organization and Mrs. S. C. Stimson of\r\nTerre Haute was chairman. The Council was financed by these\r\norganizations, assisted by churches, business men's clubs, ministers',\r\nteachers' and farmers' associations and individual contributions.\r\n\r\nThe Act was ruled unconstitutional in October but the women had a\r\ntaste of citizenship, for all over the State they had registered and\r\nin some places they had voted on prohibition and public improvements.\r\nThe Legislative Council sent out 75,000 registration cards. Municipal\r\nauthorities had appointed women to places of trust. The Suffrage Board\r\nformulated a plan for the study of citizenship, of the United States\r\nand State constitutions, methods of voting, etc., which has since been\r\non the program of study for the local societies.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1917, Mrs. Noland and Mrs. Ray were again asked to speak at\r\nthe annual meeting of the Municipal League and the following was\r\nadopted with enthusiasm: \"Resolved; That the Municipal League of\r\nIndiana does hereby recommend full and equal suffrage for women in\r\nboth State and nation.\"\r\n\r\nBy a vote of the local societies it was decided not to call a\r\nconvention during the war, as every woman was engaged in war work, but\r\nmonthly board meetings were held in different towns in 1917 and 1918,\r\nkeeping the busy women in touch with suffrage work. During the\r\nLegislature of 1919 other organizations seemed desirous of pushing the\r\nsuffrage work and the association voted to give them a free hand. It\r\nassisted the effort for the ratification of the Federal Amendment by\r\nsending letters and having resolutions passed by organizations. It has\r\nat this time (1920) 29 affiliated societies, 500 dues-paying members\r\nand over 6,000 non-dues-paying members.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANA. PART II.[46]\r\n\r\nDuring the early years of the present century there was no definite\r\ncampaign for suffrage in Indiana but the partial success of repeated\r\nefforts to influence the General Assembly to pass various suffrage\r\nbills showed a large body of interested if unorganized favorable\r\nopinion. The State had never been entirely organized but there were\r\nseveral centers where flourishing associations kept up interest. In\r\n1901 the State Woman Suffrage Association under the presidency of Mrs.\r\nBertha G. Wade of Indianapolis engaged chiefly in legislative work but\r\nit gradually ceased effort. There were attempts toward its\r\nre-organization in the following years, assisted by the National\r\nAssociation, but interest proved to be not sufficiently keen or\r\nwidespread.\r\n\r\nThe Indianapolis Equal Suffrage Society, organized in 1878 under the\r\ndirection of Mrs. May Wright Sewall, had never suspended activities.\r\nDr. Amelia R. Keller was its president in 1909 and in order to\r\nstimulate interest and give an outlet for the energy of its members,\r\nassisted by Mrs. Grace Julian Clarke, Mrs. Felix T. McWhirter, Mrs.\r\nJohn F. Barnhill, Mrs. W. T. Barnes, Mrs. Winfield Scott Johnson and\r\nDr. Rebecca Rogers George, she formed the Women's School League on\r\nOctober 1, \"to elect a woman to the school board and improve the\r\nschools of Indianapolis.\" Dr. Keller was made president and the other\r\nofficers were, vice-presidents, Dr. George and Mrs. McWhirter;\r\nsecretary, Mrs. Julia C. Henderson; treasurer, Miss Harriet Noble;\r\ndirectors, Mrs. Clarke, Mrs. Barnhill, Mrs. Arthur B. Grover, Mrs.\r\nJohnson, Mrs. Linton A. Cox, Mrs. Laura Kregelo, Mrs. Edgar A.\r\nPerkins, Dr. Mary A. Spink, Miss Belle O'Hair and Miss Tarquinia Voss.\r\nMany of these names become familiar in the later records of suffrage\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the league's program succeeded and a woman was\r\nelected to the school board of Indianapolis. At the same time the\r\nwomen of Terre Haute, where under a new law the school board was\r\nelective, made a like attempt through the Woman's Club and the local\r\nsuffrage society and were also successful. These were the only places\r\nwhere school boards were elective. Many women showed themselves eager\r\nto work for a woman on the school board who were indifferent to the\r\nlarger aspects of suffrage. It was soon clear, however, that the\r\nschools could not stand alone in municipal affairs but where boards\r\nwere not elected it would be necessary to vote for Mayor and\r\ncouncilmen to influence school conditions, therefore on April 21,\r\n1911, the organization dropped the word \"school\" from its title and\r\nbecame the Woman's Franchise League of Indiana. Dr. Keller continued\r\nas president and associated with her as officers were Mrs. Meredith\r\nNicholson and Mrs. McWhirter, vice presidents; Mrs. Henderson,\r\nsecretary; Mrs. Barnhill, treasurer.\r\n\r\nA State convention of the league was held in Indianapolis April 12,\r\n1912, and one took place annually after that date, always in the\r\ncapital. At this convention Dr. Martha Griffiths of Crawfordsville and\r\nDr. Adah McMahon of Lafayette were added to the directors. This year\r\nthe league affiliated with the National American Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation.[47] By May, 1916, there were sixty branch leagues and\r\n3,000 members; in May, 1919, there were 300 branches and 16,000\r\nmembers. Dr. Keller continued as president until the convention of\r\n1917, when Mrs. Richard E. Edwards of Peru was elected and served two\r\nyears. At the convention of 1919 Miss Helen Benbridge of Terre Haute\r\nwas chosen. The Franchise League was exceedingly fortunate in its\r\nthree presidents, who gave the most of their time, thought and effort\r\nto its demands without salary. Dr. Keller organized it largely through\r\nthe force of her own personality and was able to gather around her\r\nother strong and determined women through whom the idea of suffrage\r\nwas carried out into the State. Mrs. Edwards took up the work of more\r\nintensive organization of the State outside of Indianapolis and\r\nsucceeded, with Miss Benbridge as State organizer, in multiplying the\r\nbranch leagues and the members by five. Miss Benbridge's work as\r\npresident was that of consolidating these gains and directing the\r\nwomen in the use of the vote which they thought they had won. The list\r\nis too long to be given of those who deserve special mention for years\r\nof devoted service.\r\n\r\nFrom the spring of 1917 to the autumn of 1918 the members of force and\r\ncharacter were drawn upon for war service and the league suffered the\r\ntemporary loss of some of its best workers, who were filling executive\r\npositions in the many war agencies. Of the directorate Miss Adah Bush\r\nworked first in Washington with the Woman's Council of National\r\nDefense and later went to France with the Young Women's Christian\r\nAssociation; Mrs. Fred McCulloch was State chairman of Liberty Loans;\r\nDr. McMahon went to France on the staff of the Women's Oversea\r\nHospitals; Mrs. Henderson was chairman of the \"four minute speakers\"\r\nwho at their own expense went over the State speaking for Liberty\r\nLoans, Red Cross, etc.\r\n\r\nUnder the able direction of Miss Benbridge the league continued to\r\nincrease until there were but four counties in which it had no\r\nrepresentation. The changed status of members from suffrage workers\r\nto voters necessitated a different sort of activity. Organizers were\r\nstill employed to some extent and suffrage propaganda used in the more\r\nremote counties but the stress was laid upon teaching women to use the\r\nvote intelligently and appreciate the power it gives. A Citizenship\r\nSchool of the nature of a Normal School was held in Indianapolis in\r\nOctober and women from all over the State attended a five days'\r\nsession and heard talks on the nature and various functions of the\r\ngovernment and the duties of citizens, by men and women who were\r\nexperts in their various lines. They took back to their own towns the\r\ninspiration received and these schools were carried on quite\r\ngenerally. The State Superintendent of Education sent out a bulletin\r\nasking the teachers to give their aid and recommending that the public\r\nschools be used for this work. A monograph entitled An Aid to the\r\nCitizen in Indiana was prepared by Miss Martha Block of Terre Haute\r\nand published by the league. This movement to train the new voters\r\ncommanded the respect of educators and several professors in\r\neducational institutions offered their services as teachers in the\r\nschools of citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe convention of April, 1920, was the end of the Franchise League.\r\nWith the near ratification of the Federal Amendment work for suffrage\r\nseemed to be finished in Indiana. As a Presidential suffrage bill had\r\nbeen passed by the General Assembly the women of the State were\r\nalready partial voters, so the league disbanded and in its place was\r\nformed the State League of Women Voters, with Mrs. A. H. Beardsley of\r\nElkhart as president. The branches became auxiliaries and the\r\nleaders realized that the task of getting the vote was nearly\r\naccomplished--that of using it had just begun.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. 1901. Through the efforts of the Equal Suffrage\r\nAssociation a resolution for an amendment to the State constitution to\r\nstrike out the word \"male\" in the suffrage section was introduced. In\r\nthe Senate it was buried in committee. In the House it received a vote\r\nof 49 ayes, 33 noes--a two-thirds majority being necessary. Later it\r\nwas reconsidered and passed by a vote of 52 to 32. This vote was also\r\nreconsidered and the amendment laid on the table.\r\n\r\n1907. Municipal suffrage bill was defeated by the Senate.\r\n\r\n1911. A similar measure was reported favorably out of committees but\r\nlost in the Lower House by 41 ayes, 48 noes, and no action was taken\r\nby the Senate.\r\n\r\n1913. A resolution to submit a woman suffrage amendment was held up in\r\ncommittees. The Senate passed a School suffrage bill by 27 ayes, 10\r\nnoes, but there was no action in the House.\r\n\r\n1915. A Presidential suffrage bill passed in the Senate by 37 ayes, 3\r\nnoes, was held up in the House.\r\n\r\n1917. This year will long be remembered by suffrage workers as one of\r\ntriumphs and defeats. The legislative session was a continued triumph\r\nand showed that public opinion was in favor of granting political\r\nrights to women. A great help was the agitation for a new\r\nconstitution. The present constitution was adopted in 1851. An early\r\ncourt decision that an amendment in order to carry must have a\r\nmajority of all the votes cast at the election made amending it a\r\npractical impossibility and for a long time there had been a\r\nwidespread demand for a new one for the sake of many needed reforms.\r\nThe suffragists joined the agitation for it, as this seemed the only\r\nway to get the vote by State action.\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly of 1917 was carefully selected to pass the\r\nProhibition Amendment and was known to be favorable to the calling of\r\na constitutional convention. While the suffragists placed their hope\r\nin a new constitution yet in order to leave no means untried the\r\nLegislative Council of Women was formed at the suggestion of Mrs.\r\nGrace Julian Clarke, composed of representatives of eight or ten State\r\norganizations, of which the Women's Franchise League was one. Mrs.\r\nFelix T. McWhirter was made president and it was decided to present a\r\nPresidential and Municipal suffrage bill similar to the one passed by\r\nthe Illinois Legislature in 1913 and sustained by the courts.\r\n\r\nThe Council had quarters in the State House granted by the Governor;\r\nthe Women's Franchise League immediately established a bureau there by\r\nhis consent with Mrs. John F. Barnhill and Miss Alma Sickler in charge\r\nand all the women labored diligently for the success of the measure.\r\nThe work over the State was necessarily done largely by the Franchise\r\nLeague, as it had the local societies necessary. The Council secured\r\nthe aid of Mrs. Catharine Waugh McCulloch, a lawyer of Chicago, who\r\nhad been closely identified with the Illinois law. For the first time\r\nin the history of Indiana's struggle for equal suffrage there was\r\nactive opposition by women. Nineteen, all of Indianapolis, appealed to\r\nthe Senate Committee on Rights and Privileges, which had the bill in\r\ncharge, for a hearing in order to protest.[48] This was granted but it\r\nresulted in an enthusiastic suffrage meeting. The \"nineteen,\" who\r\nasserted that they spoke for 90 per cent. of unorganized women in\r\nIndiana, were represented by Mrs. Lucius B. Swift, Miss Minnie\r\nBronson, secretary of the National Anti-Suffrage Association, and\r\nCharles McLean of Iowa, who was in its employ. Mrs. McCulloch,\r\nMeredith Nicholson, Mrs. Edward Franklin White, now president of the\r\nCouncil, former Mayor Charles A. Bookwalter and a number of others\r\nspoke for the bill.\r\n\r\nThe calendar of suffrage events in the Legislature of 1917 was as\r\nfollows: On January 23 the bill for a constitutional convention passed\r\nthe House by 87 ayes, 10 noes; on the 31st it passed the Senate by 34\r\nayes, 14 noes, and on February 1 was signed by Governor James P.\r\nGoodrich. On February 8 the Presidential-Municipal suffrage bill\r\npassed the Senate by 32 ayes, 16 noes. It also provided that women\r\ncould vote for delegates to the constitutional convention, were\r\neligible to election as delegates and could vote on the adoption of\r\nthe proposed new constitution. On the 22nd it passed the House by 67\r\nayes, 24 noes, and was signed by the Governor. The Legislature also\r\nvoted to submit a full suffrage amendment to the electors.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was early apparent that these laws would be carried into\r\nthe courts preparations were at once made by the women for\r\nregistering. The Franchise League opened booths in the shopping\r\ndistricts in the cities and urged the women in the country to go to\r\nthe court house and register when in town. They sent out women\r\nnotaries with blanks to register the women.[49] In Vigo county, of\r\nwhich Terre Haute is the county seat, 12,000 registered, more than the\r\naverage number of men who usually voted at elections. In all parts of\r\nthe State the registration of women was very large and the women were\r\nstudying political questions and showing much interest in their new\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the action of the Legislature was taken into the courts. On\r\nJune 25 Judge W. W. Thornton of the Marion County (Indianapolis)\r\nSuperior Court gave a decision that the Legislature had no authority\r\nto call for an election of delegates to a constitutional convention\r\nand no right to grant to women the privilege of voting for such\r\ndelegates or any constitution which might be submitted to the voters.\r\nThe case was at once appealed to the State Supreme Court, which on\r\nJuly 13 sustained the decision. Chief Justice Erwin wrote the opinion\r\nand Justices Spencer, Harvey and Myers concurred. Justice M. B. Lairy\r\nfiled a dissenting opinion. There was a wide difference of opinion\r\namong the lawyers of the State.\r\n\r\nThis decision did not affect the limited suffrage law, which gave\r\nwomen the right to vote for (1) Presidential electors; (2) all State\r\nofficers not expressly named in the constitution, including Attorney\r\nGeneral and Judges of the Appellate, Superior, Criminal, Probate and\r\nJuvenile Courts; (3) all city, township and county officers not named\r\nin the constitution. The law was referred to as nine-tenths suffrage.\r\n\r\nAction was brought in the Superior Court of Marion county for a\r\ndecision on this law. The Court gave an adverse decision but it\r\nembraced definitely only the Municipal suffrage. On October 26 the\r\nSupreme Court upheld this decision concerning Municipal suffrage and\r\nimplied that the entire Act was invalid. The counsel for the\r\nsuffragists, including some of the foremost lawyers in the State,\r\nwith Eli Stansbury, Attorney General, and Mrs. McCulloch, presented\r\nmasterly arguments. The decision of the Supreme Court was condemned by\r\nmany besides the suffragists. The hearing was not held before a full\r\nbench and the decision was not unanimous, Judge Lawson J. Harvey\r\nhanding down a dissenting opinion, so that two men virtually decided\r\nthis momentous question.\r\n\r\nBy Jan. 1, 1919 the Federal Suffrage Amendment had passed the Lower\r\nHouse of Congress and was pending in the Senate and the first act of\r\nthis year's Legislature, convened in joint session before either House\r\nhad organized, was to adopt a resolution with but one opposing vote\r\ncalling on the U. S. Senate to submit the amendment, which was signed\r\nby the Governor and forwarded to Washington.\r\n\r\nThere still remained from the legislation of 1917 the amendment to the\r\nState constitution, which in order to be submitted to the voters had\r\nto be passed also by the Assembly of 1919. The result of the election\r\nof 1918 in the State had been an overwhelmingly Republican victory.\r\nSince the party had the Governor and a majority of both branches of\r\nthe Assembly, it wished to put through a program of legislation that\r\ncalled for amending the constitution and the leaders requested the\r\nwomen to withdraw the suffrage amendment, as while one was pending\r\nanother could not be introduced. Feeling that withdrawal with a\r\nfriendly majority was better than defeat and enmity, the board of the\r\nFranchise League consented. One of the rewards for this sacrifice,\r\nwhich meant a delay of two years in presenting a State amendment to\r\nthe voters, was the Presidential suffrage bill, which passed on\r\nFebruary 6 with six dissenting votes out of a membership of 150. Three\r\nof these were in the Senate, Erskine of Evansville, Haggerty of South\r\nBend and Kline of Huntington; three in the House, Sambor, Bidaman and\r\nO'Neal, the last two from Terre Haute, Sambor from Indiana Harbor. The\r\nvote to submit an amendment was unanimous in both Houses.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. When the U. S. Senate finally voted on June 4 to submit\r\nthe Federal Suffrage Amendment the Legislature of 1919 had adjourned.\r\nThe question of ratification was of course uppermost in the minds of\r\nthe leaders of the Franchise League and there would be no regular\r\nsession until 1921. Governor Goodrich came to the rescue by promising\r\nto call a special session, probably in August or September of the\r\npresent year, and sent out an invitation to other Governors of States\r\nsimilarly situated to join him in securing enough special sessions to\r\nratify the amendment at an early date. The Governor of Indiana has\r\npower to call a special session but can not restrict its action. Owing\r\nto internal affairs of the State which developed the Governor\r\npostponed indefinitely calling the session, assuring the suffragists,\r\nhowever, that it should be held in time for them to vote at the\r\ngeneral election of 1920. Finally after repeated importunities he\r\nannounced on December 30 that he would call the special session for\r\nJan. 15, 1920, if a two-thirds majority of the Legislature would agree\r\nto consider only ratification.\r\n\r\nAlthough both political parties had declared in favor of ratifying the\r\namendment yet the women were expected to secure these pledges and it\r\nwas no small task but it seemed to be the only way. The suffragists\r\nlooked to the Franchise League for action and it assumed the burden.\r\nMiss Helen Benbridge, its efficient president, soon made the\r\npoliticians see the wisdom of a special session. Under her skillful\r\nmanagement letters from the Governor were sent immediately to all the\r\nlegislators enclosing this agreement: \"I hereby pledge myself to\r\nattend a special session of the General Assembly limited to the\r\nratification of the Federal Suffrage Amendment and to vote for\r\nadjournment immediately afterwards.\"\r\n\r\nThe Franchise League opened headquarters in Indianapolis and every\r\npressure, political and other kinds, was brought to bear on the\r\nmembers and answers began to come in as early as January 4. It\r\ncertainly was a surprise to the politicians when on the afternoon of\r\nJanuary 13 Miss Benbridge was able to take to Governor Goodrich signed\r\npledges from 35 Senators and 67 Representatives, a two-thirds majority\r\nin each House. The Governor at once issued a call for a special\r\nsession on January 16, allowing two days for members to reach\r\nIndianapolis. That so many legislators were willing to lay aside party\r\nprejudice and meet for a non-partisan purpose speaks volumes for the\r\npersonnel of the General Assembly of 1919. Recognition is due\r\nespecially to the Democratic members, as the Republicans were obeying\r\nthe call of their chief but the Democrats, on the summons of a\r\nRepublican Governor, laid aside their convictions and acted solely in\r\nthe interest of the women of their State.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly convened at 10 a. m. on Jan. 16, 1920, and more than a\r\nhundred suffrage workers from all parts of the State were present to\r\nsee the fruition of their hopes. Miss Benbridge, president, and Mrs.\r\nEdwards, past president of the league, sat on the rostrum in the\r\nSenate Chamber beside Lieutenant Governor Edgar D. Bush, and in the\r\nHouse beside Speaker Jesse Eschbach, while the vote was being taken.\r\nThe Senators enjoyed what was termed \"the last wail\" of the three\r\nanti-suffragists who voted no--Kline, Haggerty and Franklin McCray of\r\nIndianapolis. Forty-three votes were cast in favor. The resolution was\r\nthen taken to the House, which had organized and was waiting, and,\r\nafter suspension of the rules so that the three necessary readings\r\nmight be had in one day, it was passed by the unanimous vote of the 93\r\nmembers present. It was signed at once by the presiding officers and\r\nat half past four of the same afternoon by Governor Goodrich, who\r\nwished in this way to show his agreement, though his signature was not\r\nlegally necessary. Mrs. Goodrich, Miss Benbridge, many officers of the\r\nFranchise League and other interested suffragists witnessed the\r\nsigning. With this act the long struggle for political rights for\r\nwomen which began in Indiana in the middle of the nineteenth century\r\nwas finished.\r\n\r\nA large and enthusiastic meeting of the board of the Franchise League\r\nwas then held and there was general congratulation. Miss Benbridge,\r\nwho presided, said: \"The work that assured the special session and the\r\nresult achieved was done, not by the little group of women in the\r\nIndianapolis headquarters, although their work was well done, but by\r\nthe women over the State. Much credit for the success belongs to the\r\nFranchise League members everywhere, who have won the sentiment of\r\ntheir localities for woman suffrage.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[45] The History is indebted for this part of the chapter to Mrs. Anna\r\nDunn Noland, president of the Stale Equal Suffrage Association.\r\n\r\n[46] The History is indebted for this part of the chapter to Mrs.\r\nLenore Hanna Cox, an officer of the Woman's Franchise League from its\r\nbeginning in 1911 until its work was finished in 1920.\r\n\r\n[47] From 1912-1919 the following women served as vice presidents,\r\nsome for several terms: Mrs. Meredith Nicholson, Mrs. Felix T.\r\nMcWhirter, Mrs. Ovid B.

The clergy\r\nof all denominations feel the importance of this step--you will find\r\nthem ready and willing to cooperate. 3. Push registration of women\r\nduring the week of July 4 as a patriotic measure. Secure favorable\r\nmention of woman suffrage in all speeches. 4. Close the week's\r\ncampaign by a mass meeting of all local women's organizations,\r\nincluding clubs, lodges and church societies. 5. Secure all the\r\nnewspaper space possible for this patriotic week. Publish this entire\r\nprogram and report its progress daily to your local papers....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nIOWA.[50]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Iowa Equal Suffrage Association was still conducting in 1901 the\r\ncampaign of education begun when it was organized in 1870, as fully\r\ndescribed in Volume IV of the History of Woman Suffrage. It seemed at\r\ntimes a deadly dull process and there rose bolder spirits occasionally\r\nwho suggested more vigorous and spectacular means of bringing the\r\ncause to the attention of the general public and of focusing the\r\nsuffrage sentiment, which evidently existed, on the members of the\r\nLegislatures and putting them into a more genial attitude toward\r\nsubmitting a State constitutional amendment, which seemed in those\r\nyears the only method of attaining the longed-for goal. Women,\r\nhowever, are conservative and the Iowa laws on the whole were not\r\noppressive enough to stir the average woman to active propaganda for a\r\nshare in making and administering them. Therefore the association\r\nproceeded along the beaten path--by way of education, aided by social\r\nand economic evolution, from which not even the most non-progressive\r\nwoman can protect herself, much less protect her daughters. The\r\nassociation never missed an annual meeting and the women elected each\r\nyear to carry on its work were those who knew that the cause might be\r\ndelayed but could not be permanently defeated.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1901 was held in November at Waterloo and Mrs.\r\nAdelaide Ballard was elected president, having previously served two\r\nterms. The conventions of 1902, 1903 and 1904 took place in October in\r\nDes Moines, Boone and Sheldon, and Mrs. Mary J. Coggeshall was each\r\nyear elected president, having held the office two years at earlier\r\ndates. The annual meeting of 1905 was held in November at Panora; that\r\nof 1906 in September at Ida Grove, and Bertha A. Wilcox was each year\r\nelected president.\r\n\r\nThe conventions of 1907 and 1908 took place in October at Des Moines\r\nand Boone and the Rev. Eleanor E. Gordon was at each elected\r\npresident. Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, president of the National American\r\nWoman Suffrage Association, who was present at the Boone convention,\r\nhad just returned from England and was accompanied by two young\r\nEnglish women who had campaigned for suffrage there and who took part\r\nin the convention. She had marched in a parade in London and was very\r\ndesirous that parades should be held here. After much urging from her\r\nand the president, and with great trepidation and many misgivings on\r\nthe part of the members, a procession was formed and marched through\r\nthe principal streets on October 29. The Boone _Daily News_ said: \"The\r\nmembers of the Equal Suffrage Association in convention, scores of the\r\nlocal women interested in the movement and the Woman's Christian\r\nTemperance Union united in a monster parade through the main streets.\r\nThe Wilder-Yeoman Band led with the Rev. Eleanor Gordon, president,\r\nMrs. Coggeshall, honorary president, Mrs. Julia Clark Hallam, Dr. Shaw\r\nof Philadelphia and the Misses Rendell and Costelloe of London next in\r\nthe procession. From every viewpoint it was a success.\" This was the\r\nfirst or one of the first suffrage parades to be held in the United\r\nStates and it required much courage to take part in it. The crowd\r\nwhich lined the sidewalks was most respectful and when Dr. Shaw and\r\nthe English visitors spoke from an automobile there was enthusiastic\r\nresponse.\r\n\r\nIn 1909 at the State convention held in Des Moines Mrs. Hallam was\r\nmade president. In 1910, at the convention in Corydon, Mrs. Harriet B.\r\nEvans was elected to this position. The report of the corresponding\r\nsecretary, Mrs. Lona I. Robinson, was similar to those that had been\r\nmade in many preceding years and that continued to be made for several\r\nfollowing years. It showed that hundreds of letters were sent to the\r\nofficers of local clubs, asking them to interview the candidates for\r\nthe Legislature on their attitude towards woman suffrage; to sign the\r\npetitions to Congress for a Federal Amendment, which were sent to\r\nthem; to strengthen their organization; to increase their propaganda\r\nwork, for which quantities of literature were furnished. The report\r\nshowed the activities of the State officers, meetings arranged,\r\naddresses made and legislative work done.\r\n\r\nAt the annual meeting in October, 1911, at Perry, the Rev. Mary A.\r\nSafford became president. This year the _Woman's Standard_, a monthly\r\nnewspaper published since 1886 by the association, was discontinued,\r\nas there was an ever-increasing opportunity for suffrage news and\r\narguments in the newspapers of the State. On Dec. 22, 1911, Mrs.\r\nCoggeshall, who had been the inspiration and leader of the State\r\nsuffrage work since its beginning and part of the time an officer of\r\nthe National Suffrage Association, passed away. She was the link\r\nbetween those who began the movement and those who finished it.\r\nWhatever the later workers in Iowa had done had been as a candle flame\r\nlighted from the torch of her faith and devotion. She was a friend of\r\nSusan B. Anthony, of Lucy Stone and of many of the other veterans. Her\r\ndelightful home was open to every suffragist of high or low\r\ndegree--there were no degrees to her if a woman was a suffragist. She\r\nshowed her faith in the cause not only by her gifts, her hospitality\r\nand her unceasing activity during her life but also by bequests of\r\n$5,000 to the State association and $10,000 to the National\r\nAssociation. The former was used, as she would have wished it to be,\r\nin the amendment campaign of 1916 and the National Association\r\nreturned a large part of its bequest for use at this time.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1912, the convention was held in Des Moines and the Rev.\r\nMiss Safford was re-elected president. By this time new methods of\r\npropaganda were being used. During the State Fair the City Council of\r\nSuffrage Clubs in Des Moines arranged for the photoplay Votes for\r\nWomen to be shown in a river front park near a band stand where\r\nnightly concerts were given and literally thousands of people had\r\ntheir first education in suffrage through the speeches made there.\r\n\r\nThe State convention met in October, 1913, in Boone and Miss Flora\r\nDunlap was made president. An automobile trip crossing the State\r\ntwice, with open air meetings in thirty towns, had been undertaken in\r\nSeptember. Governor George W. Clark and Harvey Ingham, editor of the\r\nDes Moines _Register_, a long time supporter of woman suffrage, spoke\r\nat the first meeting and other prominent men, officials, editors and\r\nclergymen, joined the party for one or more days. Two reporters from\r\nDes Moines newspapers went with it and there was excellent publicity.\r\nMrs. P. J. Mills of Des Moines managed the trip and accompanied the\r\nparty with her car, Miss Evangeline Prouty, daughter of an Iowa member\r\nof Congress, acting as chauffeur. Miss Dunlap also made the entire two\r\nweeks' journey, while other workers joined for briefer periods. J. R.\r\nHanna, Mayor of Des Moines, wrote the Mayors of all towns in which\r\nmeetings were scheduled asking the courtesies of the city for the\r\nparty, and this, with the Governor's opening speech, gave a helpful\r\nofficial sanction.\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting took place in October, 1914, at Des Moines and Miss\r\nDunlap was re-elected president. In March the Mississippi Valley\r\nConference, with many interesting delegates, had been held in that\r\ncity and made a very favorable impression. Miss Jane Addams and Mrs.\r\nHarriet Taylor Upton, president of the Ohio Suffrage Association, had\r\nspoken at a Sunday afternoon mass meeting in the largest theater. When\r\nthe convention met at Des Moines in October, 1915, a woman suffrage\r\namendment to the State constitution had at last been submitted by the\r\nLegislature to be passed upon by the voters in June, 1916. Miss Dunlap\r\nwas again re-elected and arrangements were perfected for continuing\r\nthe vigorous campaign already under way. By the time the association\r\nheld its convention at Waterloo in September, 1916, the amendment had\r\nbeen defeated but nevertheless the meeting was large and enthusiastic.\r\nMiss Anna B. Lawther was elected president and arrangements were made\r\nfor securing as soon as possible the re-submission of the amendment.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1917 met in October at Des Moines and Miss Lawther\r\nwas re-elected. The country was now in the midst of war, and, like\r\npatriotic women everywhere, Iowa suffragists turned all their\r\nattention to helping win it. Miss Lawther served on a special\r\ncommittee appointed by the Governor to organize the women of the State\r\nfor war activities. Every woman on the suffrage board filled an\r\nimportant position in the various State war organizations and every\r\ncounty chairman and local member was active in the work of her\r\ncommunity. The women worked long, full days for the war and far into\r\nthe night for suffrage.\r\n\r\nWhen the State convention met at Cedar Rapids in September, 1918, the\r\nwomen were still immersed in war work. Meanwhile the Lower House of\r\nCongress had voted to submit the Federal Woman Suffrage Amendment and\r\nfor some months the efforts of the association had been centered on\r\nthis amendment. It had secured pledges from all the Iowa\r\nrepresentatives in Congress to vote for it except Harry E. Hull, who\r\nvoted against it. In June a \"suffrage school\" had been held in Penn\r\nCollege, Oskaloosa, for the express purpose of educating women in the\r\nneed of this amendment and the necessity of educating State\r\nlegislators to the point where it would be ratified as soon as it was\r\nsubmitted. Miss Lawther was again re-elected but resigned the next\r\nJune and Mrs. James E. Devitt, the vice-president, filled the office.\r\n\r\nIn 1919 the association was in the thick of the struggle to obtain\r\nfrom the Legislature Primary and Presidential suffrage. The former was\r\ndefeated; the latter passed both houses in April. The Federal\r\nAmendment was ratified by the Legislature July 2.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Equal Suffrage Association seemed finished. The half\r\ncentury of agitation, education and evolution was completed. The 48th\r\nand last annual convention was held Oct. 2, 1919, in Boone, which had\r\nbeen its hostess many times, and the association was happily dissolved\r\nby unanimous vote. The State League of Women Voters was at once\r\norganized with Miss Flora Dunlap, chairman, and the old workers faced\r\nthe new task of making political suffrage for women the privilege and\r\nblessing they always had believed it would prove to be.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. A resolution to submit to the voters a woman\r\nsuffrage amendment to the State constitution was introduced in every\r\nGeneral Assembly beginning with 1870. In the early years petitions\r\nwere sent, the number of signatures rising from 8,000 in 1884 to\r\n100,000 in 1900, but after that time they were almost entirely given\r\nup, as they had no effect. The resolution was introduced according to\r\ncustom in the Legislature of 1902. Also according to custom, not\r\nalways so carefully observed, the Senate passed the resolution by 28\r\nto 16, this being the Senate's year for this courtesy, and the House\r\naccepted the report recommending indefinite postponement.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 the resolution was defeated in the House and did not emerge\r\nfrom the Senate committee. In 1906 this program was repeated. The\r\nmeeting of the Legislature was now changed to the odd years and in\r\n1907 the above program was reversed. After this year the members\r\nomitted even the customary graciousness of an understanding that one\r\nbody would pass it and the other kill it, thus keeping the women\r\nfriendly and dividing the responsibility for the defeat, and both\r\nHouses in 1909 rejected it.\r\n\r\nIn 1911 the Senate treated the resolution in a most contemptuous\r\nmanner by voting to strike out the enacting clause and then passing\r\nit. This was the last time it was defeated. The tide was changing and\r\neven the most confirmed opponents knew that it was a rising and not a\r\nfalling tide. Fortunately most of the active workers who sat through\r\nthat humiliating experience lived to see the men who were responsible\r\nfor it either retired entirely from public life or so changed in\r\nsentiment as to claim a place among those who \"always believed in\r\nwoman suffrage.\"\r\n\r\nThe neighboring State of Kansas fully enfranchised its women in 1912,\r\nas did several other western States, and favorable pressure was\r\ngrowing very strong. In 1913 the resolution to submit the amendment\r\npassed in the House on February 20 by a vote of 81 to 26 and in the\r\nSenate on March 7 by a vote of 31 to 15. The deadlock was broken and\r\nevery suffragist rejoiced.\r\n\r\nThe resolution had to pass two Legislatures and in July, 1914, the\r\nRepublican State convention strongly urged the next one to pass it. In\r\n1915 this was done, by the Senate on February 12 by a vote of 38 to\r\n11, and by the House on the 23rd by one of 84 to 19. The date for the\r\nreferendum to the voters was set at the time of the primary elections,\r\nJune 5, 1916, over three years from the time the resolution was first\r\npassed. After forty-five years thus far had the workers for woman\r\nsuffrage arrived.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe activities of the State association were at once turned to the\r\neducation of the voters. It had been long thought by both State and\r\nnational leaders that if the amendment could be brought before them\r\nthey would give a large majority for it. Probably no State ever went\r\ninto a campaign under more favorable auspices and until the last few\r\nweeks it seemed that victory was certain and the women had learned\r\nthat it was not entirely a State matter but one of national interest.\r\nThe national president, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, gave six weeks of\r\ntime to the campaign and liberal contributions of money, as she\r\nconsidered Iowa her State, having spent a large part of her life\r\nthere. The honorary president, Dr. Shaw, other national officers,\r\nState presidents and men and women suffragists from many other States\r\nrendered valuable help in time, money and service of all sorts. Large\r\nnumbers of Iowa women who had never helped before now did effective\r\nwork. The long-time suffragists devoted themselves wholly to the\r\ncampaign. Many Iowa men gave great assistance. A Men's League for\r\nWoman Suffrage, John H. Denison, president, was organized with\r\nheadquarters at Des Moines and branches in all the large cities, forty\r\naltogether. These leagues not only assisted with counsel but raised\r\nfunds, placed speakers and helped get out the vote. O. G. Geyer was\r\nthe executive secretary and the State offices of the League adjoined\r\nthose of the State Suffrage Association. There were the closest\r\ncooperation and the greatest harmony in the work of the two\r\norganizations. An unusually well-conducted press campaign was carried\r\non with Mrs. Rose Lawless Geyer at the head of the press department\r\nand she and Miss Alice B. Curtis, executive secretary, gave long hours\r\nand invaluable service to the campaign. Five-sixths of the newspapers\r\nnot only used plate matter and a weekly press letter but supported the\r\ncause editorially and some of them refused the paid advertising of the\r\n\"antis.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Effie McCollum Jones was finance secretary; Miss Mabel Lodge was\r\nthe first organizer in the field and there is a long list of men and\r\nwomen whose names deserve mention for the abundant time and unstinted\r\ndevotion they gave to the campaign. In some of the counties along the\r\nMississippi River, where the situation was the most difficult, were\r\nstrong groups of men and women workers. Miss Anna B. Lawther of\r\nDubuque headed one of the most active and the record of the river\r\ncounties would have been even blacker than it was but for the\r\nherculean work that they did. In Keokuk, the most southern city on the\r\nriver, this was so effective that it alone was a white spot in the\r\nlong, black line when the election returns came in. Each of the\r\neleven Congressional districts had an organizer in charge from January\r\nuntil election day. In every one of the ninety counties there was\r\norganization. Nine-tenths of them opened headquarters from one to\r\nthree months before the end of the campaign and 2,000 precinct workers\r\nwere enrolled. The whole State was covered by auto-trips in the last\r\nmonth. Approximately 5,000,000 pieces of literature were distributed,\r\nmuch of it especially printed to meet local needs and the false\r\nstatements circulated by the opposition. One cent postage for one\r\ncircularization of the voters of Iowa cost $5,000.\r\n\r\nAs suffragists throughout the nation gave their help, so the opponents\r\noutside the State tried to defeat the amendment. The women's National\r\nAssociation Opposed to the Further Extension of Suffrage sent a number\r\nof its paid workers and a considerable sum of money into the State.\r\nThere was a small anti-suffrage organization in Iowa during the\r\ncampaign affiliated with this national association, with branches in\r\nDes Moines, Davenport, Clinton, Sioux City and a few other places.\r\nMrs. Simon Casady of Des Moines was State president. John P. Irish, a\r\nformer resident, came from California under its auspices to work\r\nagainst the amendment but the press department widely circulated his\r\nfavorable declarations for woman suffrage in early years and reprinted\r\nhis editorials written during the Civil War, in which his disloyalty\r\nto Lincoln and to the Union was shown. He was much disturbed by this\r\npublicity concerning his past and soon left the State. The women's\r\nanti-suffrage association did no particular harm but the forces of\r\nevil with which it was allied did great damage and in the end defeated\r\nthe amendment. Iowa women had believed that their men were free from\r\nentanglements with these forces but they learned that no State line\r\nbars out the elements which work against democracy and the influence\r\nof women in government.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these opposing forces the amendment would have won but for\r\npolitical complications which arose during the last few weeks of the\r\ncampaign. It became necessary for the Republican party to sacrifice\r\nwoman suffrage to its \"wet\" candidate for Governor, as it felt sure\r\nthat he could not be elected in November if the vote should be given\r\nto women in June. A prominent supporter said openly: \"We had to do it\r\nin self-defense.\"\r\n\r\nThe special election and the primary election were held on June 5,\r\n1916, and after several days of waiting the final returns showed that\r\nthe amendment was defeated--ayes, 162,683; noes, 173,024--lost by\r\n10,341 votes.\r\n\r\nThe adverse vote was almost entirely in the counties along the\r\nMississippi River. They were in revolt against the State prohibition\r\nlaw and there was constant evasion of it and agitation for its repeal.\r\nNaturally those opposed to prohibition were also opposed to woman\r\nsuffrage. The vote in these counties was large enough to overcome the\r\nvote in the central and western counties where the sentiment was\r\ngenerally \"dry.\" Des Moines, the capital and largest city in the\r\nState, voted in favor; Sioux City, the second largest, recorded a\r\nsmall adverse vote; Council Bluffs on the western border returned a\r\nfavorable majority; Keokuk on the river in the southeastern corner of\r\nthe State was carried, but all the other cities on the eastern border\r\nvoted \"wet.\" The river counties of Dubuque, Scott and Clinton gave\r\n9,383 of the 10,341 adverse majority. They were the stronghold for the\r\ncommercial liquor interests of the State. The Republican candidate for\r\nGovernor received a majority of 126,754 and this party could easily\r\nhave carried the amendment.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that there were many irregularities in the election and\r\nthe board of the State Suffrage Association conferred with competent\r\nattorneys but after much consultation it was decided that it would not\r\nbe practical to contest it. The defeat of the amendment was a serious\r\ndisappointment to the temperance forces and the Woman's Christian\r\nTemperance Union determined to have the returns canvassed and if\r\npossible discover the cause. The election proceedings and officials\r\nreturns were investigated in 44 counties and the report in affidavit\r\nform consisted of 200 closely typewritten pages. The Des Moines\r\n_Register_ of Oct. 15, 1916, said of this report:\r\n\r\n     The investigation revealed several strange conditions. The\r\n     records in the Secretary of State's office disclose that there\r\n     were 29,341 more votes cast on the equal suffrage amendment than\r\n     the total cast for all candidates for Governor by all parties.\r\n     The canvass in these 44 counties, however, shows that there were\r\n     13,609 more names listed as voting, as shown by the poll books,\r\n     than there were suffrage ballots. Add to this the 2,289 votes\r\n     where certain precincts show more votes on the amendment than\r\n     names recorded in the poll books and altogether 15,898 more names\r\n     are found on the poll books than there were ballots cast on woman\r\n     suffrage. If this proportion is maintained in the other\r\n     fifty-five counties, there would be approximately 30,000 more\r\n     voters listed than there were votes on the amendment. The\r\n     question the investigator raises is: \"Did 60,000 men go to the\r\n     polls and fail to vote a primary ballot, and did 30,000 of these\r\n     fail to vote on the amendment? Did 30,000 go to the polls and\r\n     fail to vote for anybody or anything?\"\r\n\r\n     The W. C. T. U. can draw but one conclusion from this condition,\r\n     namely, that they were defrauded out of their right to the\r\n     ballot.\r\n\r\n     The investigators found that in the 44 counties ... 4,743\r\n     ballots, shown to have been cast by the list of voters, are\r\n     absolutely unaccounted for.... In 15 counties it was found that\r\n     in certain precincts 2,239 more ballots were certified than there\r\n     were names on the list of voters.... In 15 counties there were\r\n     8,067 more ballots on the amendment than there were voters\r\n     checked as having voted.\r\n\r\n     In 30 counties where the combination poll books were used no\r\n     voter was checked as having voted, but the certificates show that\r\n     55,107 votes were cast on the amendment. In 27 cities canvassed,\r\n     a total disregard or ignorance of the registration laws in nearly\r\n     all precincts appears and in many of these the violations are\r\n     most flagrant.\r\n\r\n     The law requires that the judges and clerks of election shall\r\n     make out a certificate showing the total number of votes cast,\r\n     the number voting \"yes\" or \"no\" or \"rejected.\" A total of 9,320\r\n     votes in these counties are not properly certified to and the\r\n     \"true return\" is not signed in many instances by any of the\r\n     clerks or judges and in others not by all. In this class 27,362\r\n     votes were affected. In six counties certificates properly signed\r\n     by the clerks and judges had been changed by a different hand and\r\n     in some cases several different precincts had been changed by the\r\n     same hand....\r\n\r\nMany other instances were given of incompetence and dishonesty beyond\r\nquestion, but, notwithstanding this positive evidence, the legal\r\nrequirements and restrictions were such as made any effort for a\r\nrecount or another election of no avail.[51]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA conference of the suffrage leaders was held in Des Moines the next\r\nmonth after the election. Every one was sad but no one was resigned\r\nand those who had worked the hardest and sacrificed the most were the\r\nfirst to renew their pledges for further effort. It was decided that\r\nwhile their forces were well organized they should at once begin\r\nanother campaign. The half-century-old resolution was presented to the\r\nGeneral Assembly of 1917, and, though there were arguments that the\r\nvoters had just spoken and that the question ought not again be\r\nsubmitted in so brief a time, the resolution passed by a vote of 35\r\nayes, 13 noes in the Senate and 85 ayes, 20 noes in the House.\r\n\r\nThe women continued their work for the second vote, which must be\r\ngiven by the Legislature of 1919. When it convened the discovery was\r\nmade that the Secretary of State, William S. Allen, did not publish\r\nnotice of the passage of the resolution the first time, as required by\r\nlaw and it had to be voted on again as if the first time. It passed\r\nwith but one dissenting voice in each House but the second vote could\r\nnot be taken till 1921.\r\n\r\nA bill for Primary suffrage passed the Lower House in 1919 by 86 ayes,\r\n15 noes, but met with great opposition in the Senate even from men\r\nposing as friends of woman suffrage. In a one-party State, as Iowa had\r\nbeen for many years, the dominant party hardly could feel that its\r\nsupremacy would be threatened by women's votes in the primary, but, as\r\none speaker naïvely disclosed in the debate, the \"machine\" might be\r\nthrown entirely out of gear. \"Why,\" said he dramatically to the\r\nlistening Senate, \"the Republican party would be in hopeless\r\nconfusion. Nobody could tell in advance what candidate the women might\r\nnominate in the primary!\" The bill was postponed by 31 ayes, 17 noes.\r\n\r\nThe next step was to have a bill introduced to give women a vote for\r\nPresidential electors. One of the contributing factors to its success\r\nwas the ever-increasing number of victories for similar bills in other\r\nStates, particularly the recent victory in Missouri, which had\r\ncompleted the circle of \"white\" States surrounding Iowa. One of the\r\nfeatures of the debate in the Senate was the reading of a letter from\r\nJohn T. Adams, vice-chairman of the National Republican Committee,\r\nheretofore an anti-suffragist, by Senator Eugene Schaffter, the\r\nsponsor of the bill, in which he impressed upon the Republicans the\r\npolitical urgency of granting the Presidential franchise to women.\r\nAfter a hard campaign by the Legislative Committee of the State\r\nSuffrage Association, with Mrs. Frank W. Dodson of Des Moines as\r\nchairman, the Iowa legislators joined the procession and on April 4,\r\n1919, the Senate passed the bill by a vote of 38 ayes, 8 noes, the\r\nHouse following on April 19 with a vote of 84 ayes, 2 noes.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. When the Federal Amendment went to the last vote in\r\nCongress, the Iowa delegation maintained its record on each vote\r\nthat had been taken, both Senators and ten of the eleven\r\nRepresentatives--all but Harry E. Hull--casting their votes in the\r\naffirmative. Immediately Mrs. Devitt of Oskaloosa, acting president,\r\nand Mrs. Fred B. Crowley of Des Moines, corresponding secretary of the\r\nState association, requested Governor William L. Harding to call a\r\nspecial session of the Legislature to ratify it. It met on July 2 in\r\nspecial session for this sole purpose. Men and women had made their\r\nway early to the Capitol, filling the galleries and the rear of the\r\nchambers. The legislators, too, were apparently as happy as boys, with\r\na new idea of real democracy in Iowa. It seemed like a gathering of\r\ngreat-hearted, honest-of-purpose men who were eager to do an act of\r\njustice. The joyous expressions of these men, who had taken hot, dusty\r\nrides on day trains from their farms and stores in the scorching July\r\nweather to come and cast their votes for ratification, assured the\r\nwomen of victory. It was a wonderful moment. After a joint session at\r\n10 a. m., to hear the reading of the Governor's message, by 11:40 the\r\nvote had been taken in both Houses. Every Senator but two was present\r\nand was recorded in the affirmative; the vote in the House was 96\r\nayes, 5 noes; E. H. Knickerbocker, Linn county; T. J. O'Donnell,\r\nDubuque; C. A. Quick and George A. Smith, Clinton; W. H. Vance,\r\nMadison. Senators J. D. Buser of Conesville and D. W. Kimberly of\r\nDavenport were absent. The former had voted against Presidential\r\nsuffrage and the latter had not voted.\r\n\r\nAn informal luncheon followed in one of the Des Moines tea rooms which\r\nhad often housed the suffragists in times of desolation and it was\r\nturned into a jollification meeting. Three former State presidents and\r\nother women spoke and there were many present for whom the occasion\r\nmeant the fulfillment of an idea to which they had given years of\r\ndevoted service.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[50] The History is indebted for this chapter to Miss Flora Dunlap,\r\npresident of the State Equal Suffrage Association 1913-1915 and\r\nchairman of the League of Women Voters.\r\n\r\n[51] Space is given to this report because it is a fair illustration\r\nof the conditions under which woman suffrage amendments were defeated\r\nagain and again in different States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nKANSAS.[52]\r\n\r\n\r\nKansas was not yet a State when in 1859 twenty-five of her\r\njustice-loving men and women met and formed the first association to\r\ngain political freedom for women, and the liberty lighting torch\r\nkindled then was kept aflame by organization for fifty-three years\r\nbefore the women received equal political rights with the men in 1912.\r\nA State Equal Suffrage Association was formed in 1884 and thereafter\r\nannual conventions were held.\r\n\r\nDuring 1901 Miss Helen Kimber, president of the association, travelled\r\nthrough fifteen counties and held twenty-five meetings. She had\r\nobtained for the national suffrage bazaar held in New York in\r\nDecember, 1900, besides many smaller donations, a car load of flour\r\nfrom the Kansas Millers' Association and two hundred pounds of butter\r\nfrom the Continental Creamery Company of Topeka. She was re-elected\r\npresident at the convention held in McPherson, Nov. 7, 8, and the\r\nfollowing year visited more than half the counties, forming\r\norganizations where they did not already exist. The attempt made in\r\nthe Legislature through the influence of the liquor interests to\r\ndeprive women of their Municipal suffrage, possessed since 1887,\r\nbrought more of them to realize its value and at the spring election\r\nmore than ever before were elected on school boards, for which women\r\ncould vote.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1902 was held in Topeka October 14-15 and Miss\r\nKimber was re-elected; Mrs. John B. Sims, secretary. Several thousand\r\npeople listened to the inspiring addresses of Mrs. Carrie Chapman\r\nCatt, president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association,\r\nand the senior editor of the _Woman's Journal_, Henry B. Blackwell.\r\nHeadquarters were established in Topeka. Petitions for Presidential\r\nsuffrage with about 32,000 signatures had been secured to be presented\r\nto the Legislature of 1903. There was an increased vote of women at\r\nthe spring election and forty-two were elected as county officers, for\r\nwhom only men could vote.\r\n\r\nThe State convention of 1903 was held in Abilene December 8-9 and Miss\r\nKimber was again re-elected. She reported suffrage meetings conducted\r\nat the Winfield, Beloit and Lincoln Chautauquas. Mrs. Mary C. C.\r\nBradford of Colorado was the outside speaker and afterwards spoke in\r\nfour of the principal cities. Mrs. Sadie P. Grisham of Cottonwood\r\nFalls was elected president at the convention held in Topeka Nov. 9,\r\n10, 1904. The increase of membership of nearly a thousand was largely\r\naccredited to the efforts of Mrs. Alice Moyer, State organizer.\r\nPresidential suffrage was again adopted for the year's work. The\r\nsuffrage departments were maintained at the Chautauqua meetings and\r\nliterature and letters were sent to every member of the incoming\r\nLegislature. The convention of 1905 was held in Topeka October 20-21.\r\nMrs. Grisham refused a second term and Mrs. Roxana E. Rice of Lawrence\r\nwas elected president. On Oct. 14, 1906, the convention met in Topeka\r\nand Mrs. Rice was re-elected and with others of her board represented\r\nKansas at the national convention in Chicago the next February.\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting of 1907 was again held in Topeka on November 14 and\r\na report from the national convention was given by the vice-president,\r\nMrs. Lilla Day Monroe, but all propositions and resolutions offered by\r\nthe mother organization were either rejected or referred to a\r\ncommittee and at the conclusion of Mrs. Monroe's report she moved that\r\n\"the Kansas Equal Suffrage Association withdraw from the National.\"\r\nAfter discussion to the effect that it could do more effective work\r\nalone the motion was carried. Mrs. Monroe was elected president, Mrs.\r\nJ. D. McFarland first and Mrs. Rice second vice-president. The\r\ntreasurer reported $260 in the treasury and was instructed to pay $25\r\nto the Susan B. Anthony memorial fund. The board decided to publish\r\nthe _Club Member_, devoted to women's activities.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1908 met October 30-31 in Topeka, the Good\r\nGovernment Club and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union of that\r\ncity uniting with the association in an evening program. Mrs. A. H.\r\nHorton was elected president, Mrs. Monroe first and Mrs. Margaret Hill\r\nMcCarter second vice-president. The fact was evident that there had\r\nbeen no organization work and little activity throughout the State for\r\nseveral years, and, as there was now no connection with the National\r\nAssociation, interest was awakened only at biennial periods by the\r\nconvening of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nAt the convention of 1909 in Topeka, December 10, 11, T. A. McNeal of\r\nthis city, former member of the Legislature, principal speaker at the\r\nevening meeting, chided the women and declared that the little advance\r\nmade along suffrage lines of recent years was not because of men's\r\nlack of interest but on account of women's indifference. Mrs.\r\nCatharine A. Hoffman was elected president; Mrs. R. V. Chambers first\r\nand Mrs. McCarter second vice-president; Mrs. E. E. Raudebush,\r\nsecretary; Mrs. Emma Sells Marshall, treasurer; Mrs. McFarland and\r\nMrs. Rice, auditors. The president appointed an advisory board of\r\nfifteen men and women and named Mrs. Genevieve Howland Chalkley State\r\norganizer. The press was used to advantage and good speakers from\r\nKansas and neighboring States helped to make woman suffrage a more\r\npopular subject. A number of meetings of a semi-social nature were\r\nheld in the capital city before the Legislature met. One, \"a Kansas\r\nequal suffrage banquet,\" followed a business meeting of the\r\nassociation, Jan. 28, 1910, at Hotel Throop. About one hundred guests\r\nwere present, Governor W. R. Stubbs and wife and former Governor W. E.\r\nHoch and wife having seats of honor. Mrs. Hoffman was toastmistress\r\nand about twenty men and women responded to toasts.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hoffman's policy was to make a strong appeal to the next\r\nLegislature for the submission of a full suffrage amendment to the\r\nvoters. On Dec. 9, 1910, she called her officers and a number of well\r\nknown workers to a conference in Topeka and a plan of action was\r\noutlined. A room in the State Historical Department, which through\r\nthe courtesy of Geo. W. Martin had been used as legislative\r\nheadquarters in other years, was again retained with Mrs. Monroe as\r\nsuperintendent. Mrs. William A. Johnston, Mrs. Stubbs and Mrs. C. C.\r\nGoddard were appointed a legislative committee. Governor Stubbs had\r\nbeen re-elected in November, 1910, and in his message to the\r\nLegislature in January he strongly advised the submission. Then the\r\nbattle royal for votes opened. The resolution was introduced early in\r\nJanuary. Every legislator was asked by each member of the committee to\r\nvote for it; many of the members' wives were in Topeka and teas,\r\ndinners and receptions became popular, at which the \"assisting ladies\"\r\nwere asked to keep the subject of woman suffrage to the front and in\r\nthis way many men and women were interested and educated.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hoffman was a conservative but diligent worker and among her able\r\nassistants were a number of men and women from the colleges and\r\nuniversities. Mrs. Lillian Mitchner, president of the State W. C. T.\r\nU., was a constant helper. The names of all the valiant workers would\r\nbe those of hundreds of Topeka people and hundreds more out in the\r\n\"home districts,\" who used their influence with the legislators, and\r\nthose of wives of Senators and Representatives who influenced their\r\nhusbands' votes. The State House headquarters was a busy place and a\r\nlarge amount of work was done there. The amendment resolution was\r\npassed by the votes of the men but it could not have been done without\r\nthe careful, well planned work of the women. It was adopted by a large\r\nmajority in both Houses and signed by Governor Stubbs Feb. 12, 1911.\r\n\r\nThe State convention met in Representative Hall, Topeka, May 16, 1911.\r\nKansas women were now for the third time entering a campaign for\r\npolitical liberty, which made the meeting one of unusual interest.\r\nMrs. Hoffman could not serve longer and the following officers were\r\nelected: Mrs. Johnston, president; Mrs. Stubbs first and Mrs. Cora W.\r\nBullard second vice-president; Miss Gertrude Reed, corresponding\r\nsecretary; Miss Helen N. Eacker, recording secretary; Mrs. S. A.\r\nThurston, treasurer; Mrs. William Allen White, auditor; district\r\npresidents, Mrs. Bullard, Mrs. Chalkley, Mrs. P. H. Albright, Mrs. L.\r\nC. Wooster, Mrs. Matie Toothaker Kimball, Mrs. Anna C. Waite, Mrs. W.\r\nY. Morgan, Mrs. Nannie Garrett. An enthusiastic mass meeting was held\r\nin the evening, the speakers, Chief Justice William A. Johnston; John\r\nMcDonald, former Superintendent of Public Instruction; George W.\r\nMartin, secretary of the State Historical Society; David Leahy,\r\nsecretary to the Governor, and Mrs. Mitchner; Mrs. Hoffman presiding.\r\nThe next day a joint meeting of the old and new officers was held. The\r\ntreasurer reported $37.50 received as membership fees, and $100, a\r\ngift from Mrs. Catt. This was a small sum to begin a campaign for\r\nabout 500,000 votes, but all hearts were filled with courage. Later\r\nthree district presidents resigned and Mrs. Minnie J. Brinstead, Mrs.\r\nH. Wirick and Mrs. M. B. Munson were appointed; also Mrs. Hoffman,\r\nchairman of press; Dr. Alberta Corbin, of membership extension, and\r\nMiss Effie Graham of education.\r\n\r\nThese eighteen women constituted a board of management. At its meeting\r\nJuly 10 a program was submitted by the president of the association\r\nfor the complete organization of the State. Organization, education\r\nand publicity were the watchwords adopted. The need of money was so\r\npressing that the board made personal pledges of from $25 to $200,\r\nwhich in many instances were more than doubled before the vote was\r\ntaken. This act of self-denial and consecration gave strength and\r\ncourage to go to others, for worthy as was the cause money would not\r\ncome without asking. The big public is much like the Lord, who helps\r\nthose who help themselves. The half-million voters to obtain and\r\nalmost as many women living in 105 counties to educate meant work as\r\nwell as faith.\r\n\r\nThe hottest summer and the coldest, stormiest winter followed and the\r\nworkers learned what it meant to travel across country with the\r\nmercury ranging from 110 in the shade to 22 degrees below zero; to\r\nhave a Turkish bath while making a \"votes for women\" speech or be\r\ndelayed for hours on a freight or passenger train by a snow blockade.\r\nBy January, 1912, however, one-third of the counties were organized,\r\nmany newspapers pledged to help, and headquarters established in the\r\nbest business building in Topeka. Then began a \"day in and day out\"\r\nbattle for votes. At first there was one stenographer, later three\r\nand two secretaries, and the president broke all the maximum hour\r\nlaws. Besides the regular county and precinct organizations, college\r\nclubs were formed and a Men's State League, with Dr. E. S. Pettyjohn\r\npresident. This league had a large and influential membership,\r\nincluding the Governor, the Chief Justice and other State officers;\r\nmany prominent business men, leading ministers, lawyers, teachers,\r\nprofessors and politicians. It gave the campaign prestige with the\r\nvoters and its members were invaluable as advisers and active workers.\r\n\r\nThe State convention was held in Wichita, May 7-9, 1912. Greetings\r\nwere given by Mrs. W. J. Babb, the new president of the district; Mrs.\r\nW. T. Johnston, hostess and president of the county, and Mrs. Sally\r\nToler, president of the City Federation of Clubs. Mrs. Mitchner\r\npledged the support of the W. C. T. U. and Mrs. W. D. Atkinson,\r\npresident of the State Federation of Women's Clubs, brought its\r\nendorsement and pleaded with other State organizations to \"bring in\r\nthe reserves.\" Telegrams and letters were read from Miss Alice Stone\r\nBlackwell, editor of the _Woman's Journal_; Governor John F. Shafroth\r\nof Colorado; Judge Ben Lindsey of Denver; Omar E. Garwood, secretary\r\nof the National Men's League; Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, president of the\r\nNational Association; Mrs. Oliver H. P. Belmont of New York; J. H.\r\nBraly of California and others. Dr. Helen Brewster Owens of Ithaca, N.\r\nY., field organizer, gave an interesting report of her work, which\r\nincluded addressing 176 audiences and organizing five college leagues.\r\nThe first \"motion\" was that application be made for reinstatement in\r\nthe National Association, and it was carried unanimously. Pledges\r\namounting to $1,000 were given in five minutes to finance a whirlwind\r\ncampaign proposed by Mr. Braly similar to the one successfully made in\r\nCalifornia the year before.\r\n\r\nThe evening meeting was held in the Crawford Theater and many were\r\nunable to gain admission. Mrs. Johnson presided, Mayor W. W. Winnick\r\ngave the address of welcome and Mrs. Stubbs responded. The Rev.\r\nOlympia Brown of Wisconsin, a pioneer suffragist, and Miss Jane Addams\r\nof Chicago were the principal speakers. During the convention\r\nencouraging reports were made by chairmen of the three departments\r\nand eight congressional districts and many county presidents. The\r\nState officers were all re-elected; Mrs. C. W. Smith was made\r\npresident of the sixth district and Mrs. Babb of the eighth. The\r\nafternoon features were an automobile ride by courtesy of the Commerce\r\nClub and a street meeting where Miss Addams made her first outdoor\r\nspeech, standing on the rear seat of an automobile. An evening\r\nreception at the Masonic Temple was a delightful finale to the\r\nbiggest, most enthusiastic suffrage convention ever held in the State.\r\n\r\nAn executive board meeting and a conference took place May 9, at which\r\ndate the State, district and county officers of the organized forces\r\nnumbered more than 2,000 women. These with the men in favor and most\r\nof the newspapers created a suffrage sentiment which reached every\r\ncorner of the State. Nearly all of the forty field workers were\r\nKansans, but assistants and money came from other State organizations\r\nand individuals. The National Association contributed in literature\r\nand money $2,076. Mrs. Laura M. Johns, now of California, and other\r\n\"formerly of Kansas\" women sent counsel and gifts. Kansas people gave\r\nmost of the money which the campaign cost, and some of the $6,000\r\nexpended was so sacred that it was handled with tearful eyes and\r\nreverent touch. For instance, one letter enclosed a check for $100,\r\nrepresenting \"the life savings of Mary,\" who wanted it used in a\r\ncampaign State. In another was $10 \"from mother's money, who wanted\r\nthis justice for women, but it did not come while she lived.\" Another\r\nwoman wrote: \"This is my sainted mother's birthday and I want this $5\r\nused in her memory.\" One had made provisions in her will to leave $200\r\nfor the next campaign, but thanked God it had come while she could\r\nwork as well as give. There were the widows' mites, many times meaning\r\nsacrifice and toil, and single dollars came from women who were too\r\nold or too ill to work but wanted to have a part. There were also a\r\nfew surreptitious dollars from women whose husbands were boasting that\r\ntheir wives did not want to vote, and \"joy dollars\" for sons and\r\ndaughters or the new-born babe. All these gifts were thrice blessed.\r\n\r\nWith votes as with most of the dollars--they were not coming\r\nunsought, and in order to make sure of them they must be looked for in\r\ntheir own habitat. This the women did on horseback, in wagons,\r\ncarriages, steam cars and automobiles. They were found in the shops,\r\noffices and stores, at the fairs, conventions and Chautauquas, at the\r\ntheater and the circus, on the farms and the highways, at the fireside\r\nand in the streets. One automobile trip covered a part of the same\r\nroute travelled by the Rev. Olympia Brown and other suffrage workers\r\nin the campaign of 1867, when they often rode in ox-teams or on Indian\r\nponies, stopped over night in dugouts or sod houses and finally were\r\ndriven back by hostile Indians. This mental picture made the trip over\r\ngood roads and through villages of pretty homes seem like a pleasure\r\nride. Miss Laura Clay of Kentucky; the president, Mrs. Johnston; Mrs.\r\nKimball and Mrs. Hoffman, who furnished the car, made one trip of\r\n1,000 miles in the fifth district and Miss Clay was then placed in\r\ncharge of the sixth district offices, where she rendered valuable\r\nservice for two weeks longer, all gratuitous.\r\n\r\nArthur Capper, owner and publisher of the Topeka _Daily Capital_, and\r\nL. L. Kiene, editor of the _State Journal_, were most helpful. The\r\nfavorable Catholic vote was largely due to the excellent work of Mrs.\r\nMary E. Ringrose and her sister of California and to David Leahy of\r\nWichita, an active worker in the Men's League. W. Y. Morgan, member of\r\nCongress from Kansas, and Professor S. J. Brandenburg of Oxford, Ohio,\r\nlooked after the voters in the colleges and universities.\r\nFour-year-old Billy Brandenburg came with his mother to help in the\r\nautomobile tours and was adopted as the \"campaign mascot.\" At the\r\nstreet meetings his little cap was often heavy with nickels and\r\nquarters when he helped take collections. Kansas had often stood in\r\nthe lime-light, but while the women avoided the humdrum, all\r\nspectacular methods were discouraged and they won by keeping their\r\nefforts on dignified, conservative lines.\r\n\r\nAll along those in charge of the campaign were warned that the big\r\ninterests whose business thrives on the degradation of human life\r\nwould rather defeat suffrage in Kansas than in any other two States.\r\nEarly in the summer of 1912 a bound book of letters, entitled\r\n\"Business Versus Woman Suffrage,\" was brought out by a certain C. F.\r\nTibbles of Chicago, cunningly devised to arouse the prejudice of\r\nevery kind of business man or reform worker. Later two other editions\r\nwere issued, enlarged and more daring in their statements. They were\r\nleft in railway coaches and sent to newspaper offices with strong\r\nappeals for the publishing of the letters from time to time, but\r\nKansas men had fought too many battles with the saloon power not to\r\nrecognize its hydra head. Toward the last came one clothed in the\r\nofficial garb of the exalted Methodist Church, but warning had been\r\nsent by the women of Oregon, where he had united his efforts with the\r\nworst elements to defeat the suffrage amendment in two campaigns. The\r\nMen's League, the press and the ministers co-operated with the women\r\nand \"Clarence, the Untrue,\" was effectively bound and gagged. About\r\nthis time one of the good friends in Kansas City, Mo., discovered that\r\nthe same plan which had defeated the amendment in Ohio was going to be\r\nused in Kansas, and he loyally reported it to headquarters. A busy day\r\nfollowed and Mrs. Edwin Knapp, Miss Eacker and the president remained\r\nup all night getting out letters to expose the plan. These were sent\r\nto all of the weekly newspapers for their last issue before the\r\nelection and an Associated Press letter to be used in the Sunday and\r\nMonday issues.\r\n\r\nThanks to the splendid manhood of Kansas, these were sufficient, and\r\nwomen came into their own on November 5, 1912, by a vote of 175,246\r\nayes, 159,197 noes--a majority of over 16,000. No other State had won\r\nby so large a majority and because the count was made and the victory\r\nreported first of the three that were carried in 1912, Kansas claims\r\nthe right to the seventh place on the list of equal suffrage\r\nStates.[53]\r\n\r\nThe Jubilee Convention, May 19-20, 1913, was held in the Baptist\r\nChurch at Lawrence, and men and women came from every part of the\r\nState. The evening program was under the auspices of the Men's League,\r\nDr. Pettyjohn, presiding. Professor W. H. Carruth of the State\r\nUniversity gave the address of welcome and the Hon. W. S. Guyer, an\r\nactive helper in the campaign, responded. Addresses were made by\r\nGovernor George H. Hodges (Democrat), ex-Governor W. R. Stubbs\r\n(Republican), the Hon. W. Y. Morgan and the Rev. C. M. Sheldon. The\r\ntheme was The New Citizen, and she had a liberal share of the\r\ncompliments and good advice. At a large evening meeting Mrs. Agnes\r\nRiddle, member of the Colorado House of Representatives, gave an\r\ninteresting address. As befitted a jubilee convention, there were\r\nfeasting and music, but the subjects discussed revealed a serious\r\nrealization of the enlarged responsibilities which the vote involved.\r\nThe name of the association was changed to the Good Citizenship\r\nLeague. Mrs. Johnston declining re-election, received the title of\r\npresident emeritus, and Mrs. Chalkley was elected president; Mrs.\r\nStubbs first and Mrs. Laura Reed Yaggy second vice-presidents; Miss\r\nEacker, recording secretary; Mrs. Magdalen B. Munson, treasurer; Mrs.\r\nW. T. Johnston, auditor, and eight district presidents.\r\n\r\nDuring the months that followed, educational work and helpful interest\r\nin States having campaigns was carried forward. At a meeting in\r\nEmporia, April 3, 1914, the measures to be supported in the next\r\nLegislature by the association were chosen and a study of the\r\npolitical situation was made. The candidates for Governor, Arthur\r\nCapper (Republican), George H. Hodges (Democrat) and Professor George\r\nW. Kleihege of Washburn College (Socialist) presented the principles\r\nof their parties. Henry J. Allen (Progressive) sent greetings and Dean\r\nRelvix of Ottawa University explained the tenets of this party. A\r\nlegislative school followed, attended by women from many sections of\r\nthe State. A rally to help the campaign in Missouri was held in Kansas\r\nCity October 15, with a banquet and speeches on the Missouri side and\r\nan all day and evening meeting on the Kansas side. The principal\r\nspeakers were Dean Sophonisba Breckinridge of the University of\r\nChicago and Justice J. S. West of the Kansas Supreme Court. The annual\r\nconvention met in Lawrence Dec. 19, 1914, and Mrs. Bullard was elected\r\npresident.\r\n\r\nIn 1915 the convention was held in Topeka. As war problems were\r\nfilling the hearts and minds of the people, only a business meeting\r\nwas held. The usual resolution urging the delegation in Congress to\r\nuse all honorable means to put through the Federal Suffrage Amendment\r\nwas passed.\r\n\r\nIn 1916 the convention was held in Memorial Hall, Topeka, and the name\r\nEqual Suffrage Association was restored. Governor Capper commended the\r\nwomen for their good influence on legislation. Mrs. Catt, president of\r\nthe National Association, reviewed its activities, and urged Kansas\r\nwomen to work for the Federal Amendment and go to the national\r\npolitical conventions. Money was raised for the Iowa campaign. There\r\nhad been several attempts to organize a \"militant\" suffrage society in\r\nKansas under the name of the Congressional Union and a number of men\r\nand women had been innocently led into it. A \"question box\" conducted\r\nby Mrs. Catt did much to clarify the situation, making it plain that\r\nthere was no chance of united work by the two organizations as they\r\nwere diametrically opposed in methods. She addressed the Commercial\r\nClub at a noon luncheon and many business men testified to the good\r\nresults of woman suffrage. Mrs. W. Y. Morgan was elected president.\r\nThe Kansas members of Congress, all of whom were in favor of the\r\nFederal Amendment, were continuously urged to press for its\r\nsubmission. About fifty Kansas women marched in the great suffrage\r\nparade in Chicago at the time of the Republican national convention in\r\nJune.\r\n\r\nThe convention met in Topeka June 21, 1917, and Mrs. Morgan declining\r\nre-election, Mrs. Charles H. Brooks of Wichita was made president. The\r\nannual meeting of 1918 was held in Wichita June 12. The money had been\r\nraised to send two envoys to the Southern States and then on to\r\nWashington, Mrs. Henry Ware Allen and Mrs. Yaggy, both of charming\r\npersonality and belonging to the Democratic party, to obtain the help\r\nof Congressmen from the South, and it is gratifying to remember that\r\nthe securing of the last necessary votes in the House in January might\r\nbe attributed to the efforts of these two women. It was voted to send\r\nmoney and speakers to help in the Oklahoma campaign, where the liquor\r\ninterests were making a strong fight against the amendment. Mrs.\r\nBrooks' excellent work soon brought results. It was hard to raise\r\nmoney for anything except winning the war but she never lost sight of\r\nthe fact that winning votes for the Federal Amendment was winning\r\ndemocracy for the world. Almost without exception the officers of the\r\nassociation represented families with men in uniform. The suffragists\r\nsold in the Third and Fourth Liberty Loans $20,000,000 worth of bonds\r\nand they worked in every \"drive\" through the Woman's Committee of the\r\nCouncil of Defense. Mrs. Brooks and her entire board were re-elected.\r\nAs guests of the Wichita Equal Suffrage Society delegates and visitors\r\nwere entertained at tea in the home of the Hon. Henry J. Allen.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1919 was held in Wichita June 10-11. Mrs. Brooks had\r\nbeen elected president of the National League of Women Voters and the\r\nKansas association loyally changed its name to the State League of\r\nWomen Voters. A largely attended \"victory dinner\" was given at the\r\nLassen Hotel. Mrs. Brooks was succeeded by Mrs. Henry Ware Allen, who\r\nlater resigned, and the Executive Board in November called on the well\r\nbeloved veteran, Mrs. Catharine A. Hoffman, again to take the\r\npresidency. A special meeting of the association and a citizenship\r\nschool were held in Wichita Jan. 19-25, 1920, the latter conducted by\r\nMiss Marie B. Ames of St. Louis, the regional director of the National\r\nLeague of Women Voters.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. After an amendment to the State constitution was\r\ndefeated by the voters in 1894, women asked for full suffrage only now\r\nand then, but encouraged by Henry B. Blackwell of Massachusetts they\r\nmade special efforts after 1900 to obtain the vote for presidential\r\nelectors.\r\n\r\n1901. The Presidential suffrage bill passed the Senate by a vote of 22\r\nto 13, but the next day the vote was reconsidered on motion of Senator\r\nG. A. Knofster and the bill defeated by 23 to 13. It died on the House\r\ncalendar. On January 14 Representative J. A. Butler of Wyandotte\r\ncounty introduced a bill the purpose of which was to deprive women of\r\nMunicipal suffrage. A storm of protests began at once to pour in and\r\nit was estimated that 10,000 letters were sent to members by women\r\nfrom their home districts. The bill was twice killed in committee and\r\nreceived less than ten votes, amid derision and laughter, when its\r\nauthor tried to have it placed on the calendar.\r\n\r\n1903. Senator Dumont Smith introduced the Presidential suffrage bill\r\nand worked faithfully for it, but it was defeated on January 28 by 21\r\nnoes, 13 ayes. Cyrus Leland introduced it in the Lower House, where it\r\nwas killed in Committee of the Whole on February 11 by 62 noes, 57\r\nayes. At this session an extension of bond suffrage was granted to\r\nwomen. They had had the right to vote on bonds for school buildings\r\nsince 1887, but this act extended the privilege to all other public\r\nimprovements in cities of the first class.\r\n\r\n1905. Governor Edward W. Hoch in his message to the Legislature\r\nrecommended full suffrage for women and a committee of seven on the\r\nPolitical Rights of Women was appointed in the House. Early in the\r\nsession the politicians stated that no full suffrage measure would be\r\nintroduced. Later I. W. Crumley, chairman of the committee, introduced\r\na bill for Presidential suffrage, which passed the House, 65 ayes, 50\r\nnoes, and was killed in the Senate.\r\n\r\n1907. A House concurrent resolution to submit a constitutional\r\namendment died in Committee of the Whole and no action was taken in\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\n1909. The House bill conferring Presidential suffrage was reported\r\nfavorably, made a special order for February 16 and received 59 noes,\r\n57 ayes. The Senate bill was reported adversely.\r\n\r\n1911. The amendment resolution was introduced by Representative Henry\r\nBlock, and all available space on the floor and in the galleries was\r\nfilled during the discussion. It passed on February 7 by 94 ayes, 28\r\nnoes. The Senate resolution introduced by Senator George H. Hodges was\r\npassed on February 11 by 27 ayes, 12 noes. A two-thirds majority is\r\nrequired to pass an amendment resolution and Senator Frank Travis cast\r\nthe last and deciding vote. It was signed by Governor Stubbs. The\r\namendment went to the voters Nov. 5, 1912, and received a majority in\r\nfavor of 16,049.\r\n\r\n1913. The attitude of the Legislature this year was in marked contrast\r\nto that of previous sessions and those who feared that women would\r\nlose influence by being enfranchised were certainly undeceived.\r\nJudging from the number of welfare bills introduced without their\r\nsolicitation it seemed that the members were vying with each other as\r\nto who should champion the most. Instead of dodging or ignoring the\r\nrequests of women's committees their advice and wishes were sought.\r\n\r\n1915. The following resolution was passed unanimously by both Houses:\r\n\"Be it resolved by the Senate of the State of Kansas, the House\r\nconcurring therein, that it is the judgment of this Legislature that\r\nthe granting of the right of suffrage to the women of the State, so\r\nlong withheld from them, was not only an act of justice to a\r\ndisfranchised class, but that it also has proved to be of great good\r\nto the State and to the women themselves.\" This was approved March 15\r\nby the Governor and sent to Congress, and similar resolutions were\r\npassed by each Legislature until the Federal Amendment was submitted.\r\n\r\n1919. An Act this year required that instruction must be given in the\r\npublic schools in civic government, patriotism and the duties of a\r\ncitizen.\r\n\r\nAmong the women who were active in legislative work were Mesdames\r\nLillian Mitchner, C. C. Goddard, W. R. Stubbs, J. D. McFarland, E. E.\r\nRodebush, E. S. Marshall, Lilla Monroe, A. H. Horton, Lottie Case,\r\nFrank Lindsay, Festus Foster and S. S. Estey.[54]\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. Governor Henry J. Allen called a special session of the\r\nLegislature for the purpose of ratifying the Federal Suffrage\r\nAmendment eleven days after it had been submitted by Congress on June\r\n4, 1919. Representative Minnie J. Grinstead introduced the joint\r\nresolution and it was passed unanimously on June 16 by both Houses and\r\napproved by the Governor and forwarded to the Secretary of State on\r\nthe 17th.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[52] The History is indebted for this chapter to Lucy B. (Mrs. William\r\nA.) Johnston, president of the State Equal Suffrage Association when\r\nthe victory was won. She is under obligations to H. G. Larimer,\r\nlegislative reference and bill drafting department; Miss Henrietta\r\nAlexander, legislative reference librarian; L. J. Pettyjohn, Secretary\r\nof State; Miss Lorraine E. Wooster, State superintendent of public\r\ninstruction; Miss Suzanne Henry, Supreme Court law clerk; Dr. S. J.\r\nCrumbine, secretary State board of health; Mrs. Herbert Jones,\r\ndepartment vital statistics; Miss Linna Bresette, State labor\r\ndepartment; Miss Clara Francis, librarian State Historical Society.\r\n\r\n[53] Among the many who aided in campaign work were Judge and Mrs.\r\nFrank Doster, Mr. and Mrs. J. K. Codding, the Hon. A. M. Harvey, the\r\nHon. Geo. Waters, the Hon. C. C. Gafford, the Rev. Festus Foster, the\r\nRev. S. S. Estey, D.

Galloo,\r\nMary Dobbs, Dorothy Sherman.\r\n\r\n[54] A complete résumé of the unexcelled welfare legislation of the\r\npast twenty years was sent with this chapter but had to be omitted for\r\nlack of space. The first State constitution in 1859 guaranteed the\r\nsame educational rights to women as to men. The State University at\r\nLawrence has 54 women on its faculty; the State Agricultural College,\r\n52; the State Normal, 46.--Ed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nKENTUCKY.[55]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Equal Rights Association was formed in 1888 Kentucky was the\r\nonly State that did not permit a married woman to make a will; a\r\nwife's wages might be collected by the husband; property and\r\ninheritance laws between husband and wife were absolutely unequal;\r\nfathers were sole guardians of their children and at death could\r\nappoint one even of a child unborn; the age of consent was 12 years\r\nand it was legal for a girl to marry at 12. An infinitesimal number of\r\nwomen had a bit of School suffrage. In the rest of that century, under\r\nthe leadership of Miss Laura Clay, with the able assistance of such\r\nwomen as Mrs. Josephine K. Henry, Mrs. Eliza Calvert Obenchain and\r\nmany others, much was accomplished in the improvement of the laws and\r\nin other ways beneficial to women.\r\n\r\nNo State convention was held in 1900. Conventions took place annually\r\nin the autumn from 1901 to 1917 inclusive in the following cities:\r\nLouisville, Lexington, Covington, Newport, Richmond, Ashland,\r\nOwensboro, most often in Lexington. The convention of 1918 was\r\npostponed on account of the influenza epidemic and held in Louisville\r\nMarch 11-12, 1919. The convention which should have been held in the\r\nfall of this year was postponed because of work for ratification and\r\nbecame a \"victory\" convention held Jan. 6-7, 1920, in Frankfort and\r\nLexington.\r\n\r\nThe first president of the Equal Rights Association, Miss Laura Clay\r\nof Lexington, elected in 1888, served until November, 1912. The\r\nconstitution was then amended at her desire to prevent a president\r\nfrom succeeding herself and to provide for a three-year term. Mrs.\r\nDesha Breckinridge of Lexington was elected in November, 1912, and in\r\n1915 Mrs. Thomas Jefferson Smith of Frankfort. In 1916, Mrs. Smith\r\nresigning because of her election to the National Board, Mrs. John\r\nGlover South of Frankfort was elected to fill out the unexpired term.\r\nIn March, 1919, Mrs. Breckinridge was again elected.\r\n\r\nFor many years the association worked on a non-dues-paying basis and\r\nwas supported by voluntary contributions. Increase of activity is\r\nindicated by the following figures: The financial report for 1903\r\nshows that $359 were spent; that for 1917 gives an expenditure of\r\n$7,838. In 1912 there were 1,779 members, with organizations in 11\r\ncounties; 4,655 members were reported in November, 1913, and 10,577 in\r\nNovember, 1914, with completely organized suffrage leagues in 64\r\ncounties; partially organized leagues in 23; a roll of members in 32\r\nand but one county in which there was no membership.\r\n\r\nMany suffrage addresses have been made in the State by eminent\r\nKentucky men and women and in later years by outside speakers\r\nincluding Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, Mrs.\r\nCharlotte Perkins Gilman, Senator Helen Ring Robinson, Mrs.\r\nT. T. Cotnam, Max Eastman, Walter J. Millard, Mrs. Beatrice\r\nForbes-Robertson; Mrs. Philip Snowden, Mrs. Pethick-Lawrence and Mrs.\r\nPankhurst of England, and Rosika Schwimmer of Hungary.\r\n\r\nPropaganda work has been done by means of the press and the lecture\r\nbureau, by the offering of prizes in schools and colleges for the best\r\nessays on woman suffrage and at the State, Blue Grass and county fairs\r\nthrough speaking and circulating literature. In recent years many\r\nnewspapers have given editorial support and many more have given space\r\nfor frequent articles furnished by the press bureau. Notable among\r\nthose of recent date is the Louisville _Courier-Journal_, in which for\r\nmany years Colonel Henry Watterson inveighed against woman suffrage in\r\nimmoderate terms. From the time it passed into the hands of Judge\r\nRobert W. Bingham, and \"Marse Henry's\" connection with it ceased, it\r\nconsistently and persistently advocated suffrage for women, including\r\nthe Federal Amendment. Miss Clay writes: \"The paper with the largest\r\ncirculation of any in the State outside of Louisville and of great\r\ninfluence in central Kentucky, the Lexington _Herald_, owned and\r\nedited by Desha Breckinridge, has from the beginning of the century\r\neditorially advocated and insisted upon suffrage for women, including\r\nSchool, Presidential and full suffrage, whether through 'State rights'\r\nor Federal Amendment. It has given unlimited space to suffrage\r\npropaganda and is largely responsible for making the question one of\r\nparamount political moment.\" The _Herald_ of Louisville has been also\r\na valued supporter of the cause.\r\n\r\nThe Woman's Christian Temperance Union, of which Mrs. Frances E.\r\nBeauchamp, always a prominent suffragist, has for thirty years been\r\npresident, and the Federation of Women's Clubs have continually worked\r\nwith the State Equal Rights Association for the improvement of\r\nconditions affecting women. By mutual agreement bills in the\r\nLegislature have been managed sometimes by one and sometimes by the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIn addition to organizing the suffrage forces and creating favorable\r\nsentiment the principal work of the State Association has been to\r\nsecure action by the Legislature for suffrage and better laws and\r\nconditions for women. This work was under the direction of Miss Clay\r\nuntil the end of her presidency, with a corps of able assistants, and\r\nshe continued to help the legislative work. She was always sustained\r\nby the interest and generosity of her sister, Sallie Clay (Mrs. James)\r\nBennett of Richmond, Ky. Mrs. S. M. Hubbard of Hickman was the largest\r\ncontributor and was a strong factor in the western part of the State.\r\nAs early as 1902 a bill for the franchise for presidential electors\r\nwas presented. In 1904, to the amazement of the suffragists, the act\r\nof 1894 was repealed which gave School suffrage to the women of the\r\nthree third-class cities, Lexington, Covington and Newport. The reason\r\ngiven was that too many illiterate negro women voted. It was made a\r\nstrict party measure, but one Democrat voting against the repeal and\r\nbut one Republican for it.\r\n\r\nFollowing this action the women went to work to obtain School suffrage\r\nfor all women in the State able to read and write. In organizing this\r\nprotest against the repeal Mrs. Mary C. Roark, afterwards head of the\r\nEastern Kentucky Normal School, was a leader. Mrs. A. M. Harrison,\r\nmember of the school board in Lexington, was prominently identified\r\nwith the effort. This proved a long, hard struggle, as it was\r\nconsidered an entering wedge to full suffrage by the liquor interests\r\nand ward politicians of the cities and was bitterly fought. Year after\r\nyear the bill was defeated in the Legislature. At the request of the\r\nsuffrage association in 1908 the State Federation of Women's Clubs\r\ntook charge of it as a part of its work for better schools, but it was\r\ndefeated that year and in 1910. The Federation did not cease its work\r\nand in 1912 the Democratic party included a School suffrage plank in\r\nits platform. It already had the support of the Republican party and\r\nthis year the bill passed both Houses by a vote of more than two to\r\none. The Democrats were in control of the two Legislatures that\r\nrejected it and also of the one that passed it. Mrs. Breckinridge was\r\nlegislative chairman for the federation during the years covering\r\nthese three sessions.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 the suffragists accepted the invitation of the Perry\r\nCentennial Committee to have a suffrage section in the parade in\r\nLouisville and their \"float\" attracted much attention. This is\r\nbelieved to have been the first suffrage parade in the South.\r\n\r\nIn 1914 amendments to the new primary law were made by the Legislature\r\nsecuring the right of women to vote in the primary elections for\r\ncounty superintendent of schools. This right was in doubt the year\r\nbefore and was denied in many counties. Much work was done by the\r\nassociation in acquainting the women of the State with their rights\r\nunder the new law. This year after many efforts a resolution to submit\r\nto the voters an amendment to the State constitution giving full\r\nsuffrage to women was before the Legislature, presented by Senator J.\r\nH. Durham of Franklin and Representative John G. Miller of Paducah,\r\nboth Democrats. Favorable reports were obtained from Senate and House\r\nCommittees, it was placed on the Senate calendar, but after its defeat\r\nin the House by 52 noes, 29 ayes, was not considered.\r\n\r\nIn 1915 a plank was obtained in the Republican State platform\r\nendorsing woman suffrage, largely through the work of Mrs. Murray\r\nHubbard, chairman of a committee from the Federation of Women's Clubs.\r\nWhen the Legislature met in January, 1916, the Republicans, under the\r\nleadership of Edwin P. Morrow, caucused and agreed to support solidly\r\nthe resolution to submit a suffrage amendment to the State\r\nconstitution. The legislative work of the State association was\r\nmanaged by Mrs. Breckinridge, chairman, and Mrs. Hubbard,\r\nvice-chairman. The resolution was presented in the Senate by Thomas A.\r\nCombs and in the House by W. C. G. Hobbs, both of Lexington and both\r\nDemocrats. It passed the Senate by 26 ayes, 8 noes. In the House it\r\nwas held in the committee and although three test votes were made in\r\nan effort to bring it out and a majority was obtained on one of them,\r\na two-thirds vote was necessary and it was not allowed to come to a\r\nvote. No Republican in the Senate gave an adverse vote and only three\r\nin the House. Governor A. O. Stanley (Democrat) used the full strength\r\nof the administration, even invoking the aid of the Kentucky\r\ndelegation in Congress, to kill the measure in the House.\r\n\r\nThis year the Republican and Progressive State conventions endorsed\r\nwoman suffrage, the Democrats refusing to do so. At the national\r\nRepublican convention in Chicago the Kentucky member of the\r\nResolutions Committee voted for the suffrage plank in its platform. At\r\nthe national Democratic convention in St. Louis all the twenty-six\r\ndelegates, on account of the \"unit ruling,\" cast their votes for the\r\nState's rights suffrage plank.\r\n\r\nDuring 1917 suffrage work was displaced by war work, of which Kentucky\r\nsuffragists did a large share. They were asked to raise $500 for the\r\nWomen's Oversea Hospitals of the National Association and more than\r\ndoubled the quota by the able management of Mrs. Samuel Castleman of\r\nLouisville. Under the direction of Mrs. E. L. Hutchinson of Lexington\r\na plan to raise money for an ambulance to be named in honor of Miss\r\nLaura Clay, the pioneer suffragist, was successfully carried through.\r\n\r\nIn 1918 for the first time there was every reason to believe that a\r\nresolution to submit a State amendment would pass the Legislature, but\r\na majority of the State suffrage board voted to conform to the desire\r\nof the National Association to avoid State campaigns and concentrate\r\non the Federal Amendment and no resolution was presented.\r\n\r\nAt the State convention, held March 11, 1919, resolutions were adopted\r\ncalling upon all Kentucky members of Congress to vote for the Federal\r\nSuffrage Amendment; calling on the Legislature to ratify this\r\namendment, when passed, at the first opportunity and asking it to\r\nenact a law giving to women a vote for presidential electors. Miss\r\nClay, who for over thirty years had been the leader of the\r\nsuffragists, withdrew from the State association, which she had\r\nfounded, and formed a new organization to work for the vote by State\r\naction alone, as she was strongly opposed to Federal action. It was\r\ncalled the Citizens' Committee for a State Suffrage Amendment and\r\nopened headquarters in Lexington. It issued an \"open letter to the\r\npublic,\" an able argument for the State's control of its own suffrage\r\nand an arraignment of interference by Congress, which it declared\r\nwould \"become possessed of an autocratic power dangerous to free\r\ninstitutions.\" It conducted a vigorous campaign against every move for\r\na Federal Amendment and met the representatives of the old association\r\nat the Republican State convention in May to prevent their securing an\r\nendorsement of it. In an eloquent speech before the platform committee\r\nMiss Clay urged it to reaffirm the State's rights plank in the\r\nNational platform and pledge the party to secure the submission to the\r\nvoters of a State suffrage amendment and to support it at the polls.\r\nThe plank adopted was as follows: \"We reaffirm our belief in the\r\njustice and expediency of suffrage for women and call upon our\r\nrepresentatives in the Congress of the United States, in the\r\nLegislature and in all executive positions to use their votes and\r\ntheir influence for all measures granting political rights to women.\"\r\n\r\nThe Federal Suffrage Amendment was submitted by Congress June 4. Both\r\norganizations urged their claims at the Democratic State convention in\r\nSeptember and the platform contained the following plank:\r\n\r\n     We favor the ratification by the Legislature of Kentucky at its\r\n     next session of the amendment to the Constitution of the United\r\n     States extending to women the right of suffrage and we urge our\r\n     representatives in the Legislature and all executive or other\r\n     officers to use their votes and influence in every legitimate way\r\n     to bring about the ratification of the same. We pledge ourselves\r\n     to support in the next General Assembly, if the Federal Amendment\r\n     has not become operative by that time, the submission of an\r\n     amendment to the State Constitution granting suffrage to women on\r\n     the same terms as to men and when the amendment is submitted to\r\n     support it at the polls as a party measure.\r\n\r\nEvery candidate for the nomination for Governor had stood on a\r\nsuffrage platform and the successful Democratic candidate, Governor\r\nJames D. Black, defeated at the election by Edwin P. Morrow, was a\r\nstaunch and life-long suffragist. When he was filling out Governor\r\nStanley's unexpired term and he received a telegram in June, with all\r\nother Governors of Southern States, from the Governor of Louisiana,\r\nasking him to oppose ratification of the Federal Amendment, he gave to\r\nMrs. Breckinridge a ringing interview for use in the press to the\r\neffect that he would not oppose it. Governor Morrow, a Republican, had\r\nalways been a friend of woman suffrage in whatever form it was asked.\r\n\r\nKentucky suffragists could easily remember when they could poll but\r\none vote in Congress--that of John W. Langley. When in 1919 the final\r\nvote was taken on the Federal Amendment but one of the State's ten\r\nvotes in the Lower House, that of A. B. Rouse of Covington, was cast\r\nagainst it. There was one vacancy. Senator George B. Martin voted for\r\nthe resolution and Senator J. C. W. Beckham against it. He had voted\r\nagainst it in February, when, having passed the House, it was lost in\r\nthe Senate by a single vote.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. The November legislative election in 1919 resulted in a\r\nRepublican House and a Democratic Senate. The Republicans caucused and\r\nagreed to vote for ratification. Governor Morrow urged it in a\r\nvigorous message personally delivered to the Legislature in which he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     A government \"of the people by the people\" can not and does not\r\n     exist in a commonwealth in which one-half of its citizens are\r\n     denied the right of suffrage. The women of Kentucky are citizens\r\n     and there is no good or just reason why they should be refused\r\n     the full and equal exercise of the sovereign right of every free\r\n     people--the ballot. Every member of this General Assembly is\r\n     unequivocally committed by his party's platform declaration to\r\n     cast his vote and use his influence for the immediate\r\n     enfranchisement of women in both nation and State. Party loyalty,\r\n     faith-keeping with the people and our long-boasted chivalry all\r\n     demand that the General Assembly shall break all previous speed\r\n     records in ratifying the Federal Suffrage Amendment and passing\r\n     all measures granting political rights to women.\r\n\r\nBy agreement, a Democrat, Senator Charles M. Harriss, presented the\r\nresolution for ratification in the Senate, and a Republican, Joseph\r\nLazarus, in the House. On Jan. 6, 1920, the first day of the session,\r\nit was passed by a vote of 30 ayes, 8 noes in the Senate and 72 ayes,\r\n25 noes in the House. The affirmative vote by parties was as follows:\r\nIn the two Houses 39 Democrats out of a possible 65, and 63\r\nRepublicans out of a possible 73. That any measure should pass on the\r\nfirst day of the session was unprecedented in Kentucky legislative\r\nhistory. Democrats were in control of the two Legislatures--1914 and\r\n1916--which defeated the full suffrage measures. Democrats were in\r\ncontrol of the Legislature in 1918 which undoubtedly would have passed\r\na resolution for a State amendment, a Presidential suffrage bill, or\r\nwould have ratified the Federal Amendment had Congress acted in time.\r\nThe leaders of both parties by this time had seen a great light!\r\n\r\nThe delegates who had gathered in Frankfort for the State convention\r\nwere entertained at a buffet luncheon by the local suffrage\r\norganization, went in a body to the State House and had the\r\ngratification of seeing the Federal Amendment ratified. A\r\nglorification meeting was held that night at Lexington, twenty-five\r\nmiles away, at which Governor Morrow told why the new women voters\r\nshould enter the Republican party and Judge C. S. Nunn and Senator\r\nHarriss, leader of the Senate, told why they should enter the\r\nDemocratic party. The latter were introduced by former Senator Combs,\r\nwho had sponsored the suffrage cause among the Democrats in the last\r\ntwo Legislatures. The convention closed with an address by Mrs.\r\nEmmeline Pankhurst of England the following night, and on the next day\r\nthe officers and members of the association went to Frankfort again to\r\nsee the Governor sign the ratification.\r\n\r\nAs it was not certain that the amendment would be completely ratified\r\nbefore the general election in November the Legislature decided to\r\npass a bill giving to women the right to vote for presidential\r\nelectors. On March 11 it passed the House and on the 15th the Senate\r\nby almost the same vote given on the Federal Amendment. Only three\r\nSenators voted against it--Thomas J. Gardner of Bardwell, Hayes Carter\r\nof Elizabethtown and C. W. Burton of Crittenden. On the 16th bills\r\nwere passed making necessary changes in the election laws to insure\r\nthe voting of the women in the primaries and at the regular elections.\r\n\r\nKentucky women who rendered conspicuous service in the lobby work at\r\nWashington under the auspices of the National Suffrage Association\r\nwere Mrs. John Glover South, Mrs. Thomas Jefferson Smith, Mrs. Edmund\r\nM. Post, Mrs. Samuel Castleman, Mrs. Charles Firth and Mrs. Samuel\r\nHenning. They were equally helpful in the State political work and\r\namong many others who deserve especial mention are Mrs. James A.\r\nLeech, Mrs. J. B. Judah and Mrs. Robinson A. McDowell. The association\r\nis indebted to Mr. McDowell for legal assistance. An important factor\r\nwas the press work of Miss Eleanor Hume.[56]\r\n\r\nThe organizing of classes in citizenship was begun in the summer of\r\n1919 and the services of a specialist in politics and history, Miss\r\nMary Scrugham, a Kentucky woman, were secured to prepare a course of\r\nlectures for their use. These were published in the Lexington _Herald_\r\nand supplied to women's clubs, suffrage associations and newly formed\r\nLeagues of Women Citizens, soon to become Leagues of Women Voters.\r\n\r\nThe Equal Rights Association voted at its convention in January, 1920,\r\nto change its name to the League of Women Voters as soon as\r\nratification of the Federal Amendment was complete or Presidential\r\nsuffrage granted. The league was fully organized on December 15, with\r\nMiss Mary Bronaugh of Hopkinsville chairman.\r\n\r\nThe first vice-president of the State Equal Suffrage Association, Mrs.\r\nSouth, was elected as chairman of the Women's Division of the National\r\nRepublican Committee, and the second vice-president, Mrs. Castleman,\r\nas Kentucky member of the National Democratic Woman's Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[55] The History is indebted for this chapter to Madeline McDowell\r\n(Mrs. Desha) Breckinridge, president of the State Equal Rights\r\nAssociation 1912-1915 and 1919-1920; vice-president of the National\r\nAmerican Woman Suffrage Association 1913-1914.\r\n\r\n[56] In addition to the presidents the following served as officers of\r\nthe association: Vice-presidents: Mrs. Mary B.

PART I.[57]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of woman suffrage in Louisiana is unique inasmuch as it\r\nrecords largely the activity of one club, an influence, however, which\r\nwas felt in the upbuilding of sentiment not alone in Louisiana but in\r\nalmost every Southern State. When in 1900 Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt on\r\nher accession to the presidency of the National American Woman\r\nSuffrage Association called for conventions in the Southern States it\r\nwas found that in Louisiana the State Suffrage Association, formed in\r\n1896 by the union of the Portia and Era clubs, had lapsed because the\r\nformer was no longer in existence. The Era Club, however, was\r\nflourishing under the stimulus and prestige gained by the successful\r\nDrainage, Sewerage and Water Campaign of 1899.[58] Mrs. Catt decided\r\nthat, while it was a new precedent to recognize one club as a State\r\nassociation, it would be done in this case. Mrs. Evelyn Ordway was\r\nmade president, Mrs. Caroline E. Merrick, vice-president; Miss\r\nJeannette Ballard and Miss Jean Gordon, secretaries, and Mrs. Otto\r\nJoachim, treasurer of the new association at a meeting in May, 1900,\r\nat New Orleans. It went on record at this first meeting as a State's\r\nrights organization, which Mrs. Catt ruled was permissible under the\r\ndual character of the National Association's constitution.\r\n\r\nThe secretary entered into active correspondence with individuals in\r\nall sections of the State known to be favorable to suffrage, but all\r\nefforts to secure clubs were unsuccessful. The Era Club, therefore,\r\nextended its membership over the State in order that representation in\r\nthe national suffrage conventions could be state-wide. It had a\r\nstanding Legislative Committee and for thirteen years its activities\r\nconstituted the work of a State association. In 1904, Mrs. Merrick,\r\nLouisiana's pioneer suffragist, was made honorary president; Miss Kate\r\nM. Gordon, president; Mrs. James McConnell, vice-president; Mrs.\r\nArmand Romain, corresponding secretary; Miss Jean Gordon, recording\r\nsecretary; Mrs. Lucretia Horner (now Mrs. James McBride), treasurer.\r\nThere was no change in this board until 1913 except that on the death\r\nof Mrs. Romain in 1908 Mrs. Judith Hyams Douglas was appointed in her\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nClubs were formed during the years in various towns, but did not\r\nsurvive, until in 1913 a league was organized in Shreveport which did\r\nexcellent work under its presidents, Mrs. S. B. Hicks, Mrs. S. P.\r\nWeaver and Mrs. J. M. Henry. The first State convention was held Nov.\r\n12, 1913, in New Orleans, and the following officers were elected:\r\nMiss Jean Gordon, president; Mrs. George Wesley Smith, Rayville; Mrs.\r\nJames C. Wooten, Monroe; Mrs. Louis Hackenjos, Alexandria,\r\nvice-presidents; Mrs. R. M. Carruth, New Roads, corresponding\r\nsecretary; Miss Lois Janvier, New Orleans, recording secretary; Miss\r\nOlivia Munson, Napoleonville, treasurer; Mrs. Fannie Wolfson,\r\nCoushatta, auditor.\r\n\r\nThis board was unchanged until 1915, when Mrs. Clarence King of\r\nShreveport became treasurer and Mrs. M. H. Lawless of Garden City and\r\nMrs. D. C. Scarborough of Natchitoches, auditors. There was no further\r\nchange until 1920, when Mrs. McBride became treasurer and Mrs. Horace\r\nWilkinson took Mrs. Scarborough's place. State conventions met in\r\nAlexandria in 1914 and in Shreveport in 1915. Conferences were held in\r\ntwenty-five parishes in anticipation of the proposed constitutional\r\nconvention of 1915. A convention was held in Alexandria in July, 1918,\r\nand chairmen were appointed in forty-eight parishes in preparation for\r\nthe State amendment campaign.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the history of woman suffrage in Louisiana three factors\r\nstand out prominently as influences that molded a favorable public\r\nopinion. These are the national suffrage convention in 1903; the\r\ninauguration of charity campaigns on the lines of political\r\norganization and the forming of the Southern States Woman Suffrage\r\nConference, the object of which was to place the Democratic party on\r\nrecord for woman suffrage in this Democratic stronghold of the \"solid\r\nSouth.\"\r\n\r\nIn public opinion woman suffrage was largely associated with the\r\nAbolition movement. In 1900 Miss Gordon had accepted an invitation to\r\naddress the convention of the National Association in Washington on\r\nthe famous Sewerage and Drainage Campaign of women in New Orleans.\r\nThen and there she decided that the most important work before\r\nLouisiana suffragists was to bring this conservative State under the\r\ninfluence of a national convention. In 1901 she attended another\r\nconvention and was elected corresponding secretary of the National\r\nAssociation. In 1903 she brought its convention to New Orleans and it\r\nproved to be one of the most remarkable in the history of the\r\nassociation.[59] So impressed was Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, vice-president\r\nat large, with the possibilities in the South that she volunteered a\r\nmonth's series of lectures in the next autumn and many places in\r\nMississippi, Louisiana and Texas came under the spell of her\r\neloquence.\r\n\r\nThe influence of this convention was immediately seen in the\r\nincreasing membership of the Era Club. Its leaders recognized that the\r\nbest policy to rouse both men and women to the value of suffrage to\r\nthe individual and the community was by applied politics in social\r\nservice. It had already secured a partial franchise for taxpaying\r\nwomen and its achievements in the following years made it an\r\nacknowledged power.[60] In 1910 a great charity and educational\r\nbenefit was launched for the Anti-Tuberculosis League and the Woman's\r\nDispensary. A complete plan of organizing with Era Club members as\r\nward and precinct leaders taught them political organization.\r\n\r\nBy 1913 the movement for a Federal Suffrage Amendment was growing so\r\ninsistent that southern women who were opposed to this method felt the\r\nnecessity of organizing to combat it and to uphold the State's rights\r\nprinciple of the Democratic party. Through the initiative of Miss\r\nGordon a Call for a conference was sent in August to leading women in\r\nevery southern State and signed by twenty-two from almost as many\r\nStates asking the Governors to meet in New Orleans for a conference.\r\nIt said:\r\n\r\n     We are united in the belief that suffrage is a State right and\r\n     that the power to define a State's electorate should remain the\r\n     exclusive right of the State. We recognize that Woman Suffrage is\r\n     no longer a theory to be debated but a condition to be met. The\r\n     inevitable \"votes for women\" is a world movement and unless the\r\n     South squarely faces the issue and takes steps to preserve the\r\n     State's right the force of public opinion will make it mandatory\r\n     through a National Constitutional Amendment....\r\n\r\n     While as Southerners we wish to see the power of the State\r\n     retained, yet as women we are equally determined to secure, as of\r\n     paramount importance, the right which is the birthright of an\r\n     American citizen. We, therefore, appeal to you gentlemen vested\r\n     with the power largely to shape conditions to confer with us and\r\n     influence public opinion to adopt woman suffrage through State\r\n     action. Failing to accomplish this, the onus of responsibility\r\n     will rest upon the men of the South if southern women are forced\r\n     to support a National Amendment, weighted with the same\r\n     objections as the Fifteenth.\r\n\r\nIt was not expected that the Governors would come, but the desired\r\npublicity was secured and several of them sent representative women.\r\nAt the invitation of the Era Club the conference was held in New\r\nOrleans Nov. 10-11, with an excellent attendance. The Southern States\r\nWoman Suffrage Conference was organized with Miss Gordon president. On\r\nMay 1, 1914, headquarters were opened in New Orleans in charge of Mrs.\r\nIda Porter Boyer of Pennsylvania, as executive secretary, who had had\r\nlong experience in suffrage organization and press work. For the next\r\nthree years Miss Gordon went regularly to these headquarters and gave\r\nher entire time to the promotion of the Southern Conference without\r\nfinancial remuneration. In October a 20-page magazine, the _New\r\nSouthern Citizen_, made its appearance, which became self-supporting\r\nand proved to be a most valuable factor in the work of the conference.\r\nThe first convention was held in Chattanooga, Tenn., on Nov. 10, 1914,\r\njust before that of the National American Association in Nashville,\r\nwhich its delegates attended. It was welcomed by the Mayor, the\r\npresident of the Chamber of Commerce and many club presidents.\r\nDelegates were present from twelve States and in addition a number of\r\ndistinguished visitors. Mrs. Oliver H. P. Belmont brought with her\r\nMiss Christabel Pankhurst of Great Britain and both made addresses.\r\nAbout $1,500 were pledged.\r\n\r\nMiss Gordon said in her president's address: \"The Southern States\r\nWoman Suffrage Conference has for its immediate object to make the\r\nDemocratic party declare itself in favor of votes for women in its\r\nnext national platform. This, we southern suffragists believe, is the\r\nfirst step in what will prove a veritable landslide in the South. The\r\nconference therefore recommends to the suffragists of the South the\r\nadoption of a policy of concentration upon the Democratic party to\r\ndeclare itself.\"\r\n\r\nIn December, 1915, a national conference was held in Richmond, Va.\r\nSmaller conferences were held in Atlanta, Greenville, S. C., and\r\nLittle Rock. Miss Gordon visited most of the cities of the South to\r\norganize the women. In July, 1916, an executive meeting was held in\r\nSt. Louis at the time of the national Democratic convention. Its\r\nResolutions Committee gave a hearing to the representatives of the\r\nconference, Miss Clay, Mrs. O. F. Ellington of Little Rock, Mrs.\r\nBoyer, Mrs. Wesley Martin Stoner of Washington. Miss Gordon made an\r\nextended appeal for an endorsement of woman suffrage in the party\r\nplatform and presented a resolution to \"secure for women\r\nself-government while preserving to the State a like self-government.\"\r\nThis was not adopted, but the platform did recommend \"the extension of\r\nsuffrage to the women of the country by the States.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the principal object of the conference had been attained, its\r\nleaders hesitated to dissolve it because of its excellent magazine and\r\nwork yet to be done. It was maintained until May, 1917, when the\r\nentrance of this country into the World War made its discontinuance\r\nseem advisable.[61]\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. Prior to 1904 it was an unheard of thing for women\r\nin Louisiana to take an active part in legislative procedure. A\r\nwoman's club, the Arena, had been instrumental in obtaining the first\r\n\"age of consent\" legislation, but a Unitarian minister had entirely\r\nmanaged the Legislature. Therefore the tyros who formed the first\r\nLegislative Committee of the Era Club showed their ignorance and\r\nenthusiasm when their program included at least twelve bills which\r\nthey proposed to have enacted into law in one session.[62] Without any\r\nfriends at court it was with considerable relief that they followed\r\nadvice to put them all in the hands of an influential lobbyist. Reform\r\nbills were not in his line and the session was drawing to a close with\r\nnothing done when the Gordon sisters cast precedent and propriety to\r\nthe winds, telegraphed to the Senator from their district for an\r\naudience, boarded a morning train for Baton Rouge and descended upon\r\nthe Capitol. Article 210 of the State constitution adopted in 1898\r\nmade women ineligible to serve in any official capacity. One of the\r\nfirst acts of the Era Club had been to try to have it amended so as to\r\nallow the appointment of a woman to fill a vacancy on the School\r\nBoard. The surprised Senator met them on their arrival, learned the\r\nobject of their visit and they will never know whether sympathy,\r\namusement or curiosity actuated the Committee on Judiciary to whom he\r\nappealed for a hearing, but a few minutes after their arrival they\r\nwere pleading their cause before its members. They then called on\r\nGovernor Newton Blanchard, who offered to have Article 210 amended to\r\nenable the appointment of a factory inspector, but in their zeal for\r\nthe larger object they declined.\r\n\r\n1906. Wiser by two years' experience, the Legislative Committee was\r\nglad to accept Lieutenant Governor Jared Y. Sanders's offer of an\r\namendment for the above purpose, and Miss Jean Gordon was appointed\r\nfactory inspector for the city of New Orleans. It was not long before\r\nshe realized that the Child Labor law, under which she must operate,\r\nwas not worth the paper on which it was written. She then studied the\r\nchild labor laws of every State and selected what was best suited to\r\nsouthern conditions, and put it into form for submission.\r\n\r\n1908. The legislative program was limited to the attempt to amend\r\nArticle 210, pass a School suffrage bill and the Child Labor bill. The\r\nSchool suffrage bill, under the skillful management of Senator R. E.\r\nGueydan, assisted by Senators Albert Estinopal and James Brady and\r\nLieutenant Governor Thos. C. Barrett, passed the Senate but failed in\r\nthe House. The Child Labor bill passed the House but not the Senate.\r\n\r\n1910. Senator Gueydan introduced the amendment of Article 210.\r\nRepresentative S. O. Shattuck introduced the first resolution to\r\nstrike out the word \"male\" from the State constitution, with\r\ninstructions from the women to substitute a School or Municipal\r\nsuffrage bill if a favorable report was more likely to result. By this\r\ntime the women had sufficiently progressed to address a joint suffrage\r\ncommittee hearing in the House in the presence of an immense audience,\r\nMiss Belle Van Horn, Mrs. Parker, Mrs. Douglas, Miss Gordon and labor\r\nrepresentatives presenting suffrage arguments. The School suffrage\r\nbill was substituted and received a unanimous favorable report, but\r\nnot the necessary two-thirds vote.\r\n\r\n1912. The amendment to Article 210 was introduced by Martin Manion in\r\nthe House and William Byrnes in the Senate. In the interim between the\r\nsessions Mrs. O. W. Chamberlain, legislative chairman, had rolled up a\r\nmonster petition from all sections of the State and the favorable\r\nreport of the committee was followed by the required two-thirds vote\r\nin the House. There seemed no hope in the Senate, but Miss Gordon\r\nappealed to Senator Byrnes to call it from the calendar. There was\r\nactive lobbying among the opponents, but it finally passed and was\r\nsent to the voters! In the campaign for it the Newcomb College\r\nAlumnae, the State Nurses' Association and the Federation of Women's\r\nClubs were very active, but it was defeated.\r\n\r\nAn interesting phase of this year's session in connection with the\r\nsuffrage amendment was the presenting of the idea of Primary suffrage\r\nfor women by Miss Gordon at the hearing. She had grown so tired of\r\nhearing from the opponents of woman suffrage that their objection\r\nrested solely upon the fact that negro women would be enfranchised,\r\nthat on the part of the Legislative Committee she offered as a\r\nsubstitute for the full suffrage bill one limiting it to the white\r\nprimary elections. This novel offer was received with great applause\r\nby the assembled members of the two Houses, but was not accepted. [See\r\nArkansas and Texas chapters for Primary suffrage for women.]\r\n\r\n1914. The full suffrage bill was introduced by Representative Manion\r\nand a quiet committee hearing held, with representatives from the\r\nState Suffrage Association and the Woman Suffrage Party. It received\r\n60 ayes, 41 noes in the House, but not the necessary two-thirds.\r\nAmending Article 210 had become a city administration measure and was\r\nslated for success. A donation towards a Tuberculosis Hospital in New\r\nOrleans had been made by Mrs. John Dibert and the gift was\r\nmunicipalized by a condition which required a certain annual revenue\r\nfrom the city. She desired to be a member of the hospital board, but\r\nwas ineligible under this article. The Era Club gave notice that it\r\nwould challenge her eligibility and she supported its position. The\r\nlong desired amendment was on the way to a successful passage, but\r\nwent on the rocks because of the club's campaign against a financial\r\nmeasure for refunding the city debt known as the Nine Million Bond\r\nissue, in which the provisions for the public schools and the\r\nteachers' pay were totally inadequate and it was to be in effect for\r\nfifty years! The Era Club and the Mothers' Co-operative Club protested\r\nand worked against this political-financial alliance. In retaliation\r\ntwenty-four hours before the election the order went to the voters to\r\ndefeat the amendment to Article 210, which would have made women\r\neligible to serve on school and charity boards, and they did so.\r\n\r\n1918. Governor Ruffin G. Pleasant recommended in his message the\r\nsubmission of a woman suffrage amendment to the State constitution.\r\nThe State association had a resolution for it introduced in the House\r\nby Frank Powell; the Woman Suffrage Party one in the Senate by Leon\r\nHaas, and it passed in both.\r\n\r\nCAMPAIGNS. There have been two campaigns in the interest of woman\r\nsuffrage in Louisiana, one for preparing for an expected\r\nconstitutional convention which would have met in 1915, and the other\r\nin 1918 to amend the State constitution by striking out the word\r\n\"male.\" A special session of the Legislature in 1915 proposed a\r\nconvention to revise the constitution and submitted the question to\r\nthe voters. Immediately Miss Jean Gordon, president of the State\r\nSuffrage Association, accompanied by Miss Lilly Richardson and Mrs.\r\nIda Porter Boyer, visited the various parishes and formed working\r\ncommittees in 40 of the 63. The enthusiastic reception wherever they\r\nwent was practical testimony to the sentiment for woman suffrage that\r\nthey knew existed and could be utilized if the politicians could be\r\nmade to submit the amendment to the voters. The latter rejected the\r\nproposal to hold a convention, but the work done by the women laid the\r\nfoundation for the campaign three years later.\r\n\r\nIn 1918 there was finally submitted for the first time the long\r\ndesired amendment to the State constitution to enable women to vote.\r\nTo Governor Pleasant is due a great debt of gratitude, for every\r\ninfluence that he could bring to bear was exerted, not alone to secure\r\nits submission but also its ratification. He had particularly urged in\r\nhis Message at the opening of the Legislature the great importance of\r\nthe South's realizing the danger threatened from the proposed\r\nsubmission of the Federal Suffrage Amendment. The State Suffrage\r\nAssociation was in the midst of opening the campaign when the Woman\r\nSuffrage Party announced that they would retire from all suffrage\r\nactivity and devote themselves to Red Cross work. Robert Ewing, member\r\nof the Democratic National Committee, owner of the New Orleans _Daily\r\nStates_ and Shreveport _Times_, and a political power, offered his\r\nsupport if the Woman Suffrage Party would unite with the State\r\nassociation and leave the Federal Amendment question entirely out of\r\nthe campaign. They finally agreed to this and a joint committee was\r\nformed of the president and three capable women in each organization.\r\nHeadquarters were opened in New Orleans; the parish committees which\r\nwere organized in 1915 were found to be ready for active work. A\r\npetition to be signed was sent to each with a strong official letter\r\nfrom the Campaign Committee. A bitter three-cornered Senatorial fight\r\nwas under way and the women were asked to delay action until after the\r\nSeptember primaries, which they consented to do.\r\n\r\nAll was ready for beginning a whirlwind campaign on October 1, when\r\nsuddenly just before that date the influenza epidemic broke out and no\r\nassembling of people was allowed. To add to the difficulties, instead\r\nof the usual dry, clear weather of this season there came a deluge of\r\nrains that lasted for six weeks and the condition of the roads made it\r\nwholly impossible to do any work in the outlying districts. Thus there\r\nwas practically no campaign in the way of making personal appeals to\r\nthe voters, but in New Orleans and other cities thousands received\r\nurgent letters from Miss Gordon and other leaders. Notwithstanding\r\nthese adverse conditions, the majority against the amendment was only\r\n3,600, nearly all of it in New Orleans, where it was the result of\r\ndirect orders from Mayor Martin Behrman, through the ward \"bosses\" of\r\na perfectly controlled \"machine.\" From parish after parish in the\r\nState came reports of precincts not even being opened on account of\r\nthe epidemic and the weather. There is no doubt that others which\r\nreported an adverse majority were really carried for the amendment. At\r\na public meeting of protest immediately after Miss Gordon made an\r\naddress recalling the glorious history of the Democratic party and\r\ncomparing it with this election which had repudiated its highest\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nIn 1920 the State Suffrage Association stood alone in again having a\r\nresolution introduced for amending the State constitution, all the\r\nother suffrage societies concentrating on the ratification of the\r\nFederal Amendment, which had been submitted by Congress on June 4. It\r\nwas presented in the Lower House by L. L. Upton, in the Senate by J.\r\nO. Stewart. They were followed immediately by Representative S. O.\r\nShattuck and Senator Norris C. Williamson with one to ratify the\r\nFederal Amendment. At the close of the session Miss Jean Gordon issued\r\nthe following statement:\r\n\r\n     To the Friends of Woman Suffrage:\r\n\r\n     Now that the smoke of battle has cleared ... as president of the\r\n     State association I feel that an unbiased statement of facts\r\n     should be given in order that the history of woman suffrage in\r\n     this State may be correctly recorded. Having been at Baton Rouge\r\n     from the opening day of the Legislature until its adjournment I\r\n     can give all the facts and some of the reasons for one of the\r\n     most remarkable controversies ever held in Louisiana.\r\n\r\n     The proposed amendment to the State constitution having been\r\n     defeated in 1918 by the malevolent influences of the influenza\r\n     throughout the State and Mayor Behrman in New Orleans, it was\r\n     necessary to have another sent to the voters in 1920.\r\n\r\n     Congress having submitted a Federal Amendment to the Legislatures\r\n     it was to be expected that men and women who believe in\r\n     centralizing the voting power in Congress would work for its\r\n     ratification, but that those who claimed to be ardent suffragists\r\n     would work to defeat State submission after they found the\r\n     sentiment for ratification amounted to almost nothing in both\r\n     Houses seems incredible. The fact remains, however, that while\r\n     the actual defeat of the State amendment was due primarily to\r\n     personal animosity on the part of Senator Leopold of Plaquemine\r\n     parish, when he realized what he had done he said that if it was\r\n     possible to have it re-introduced he would vote for it, thus\r\n     giving the necessary twenty-eight votes. After all arrangements\r\n     for re-consideration had been made, Senator Louque, a faithful\r\n     suffragist of many years' standing, provoked because one of his\r\n     bills had been defeated, slipped away and it was again deprived\r\n     of the one vote needed.\r\n\r\n     In the Senate Chamber were those nine Senators who proclaimed all\r\n     through the session their intense belief in woman suffrage--so\r\n     intense that they wanted the women enfranchised immediately and\r\n     they wished to help all the women of the United States--these and\r\n     many other reasons were given by them for standing firmly for a\r\n     Federal Amendment but they voted against State submission,\r\n     knowing the Federal Amendment had been killed overwhelmingly.\r\n     Therefore the real defeat of the State amendment must be\r\n     accredited to the following nine Senators: Bagwell, Brown,\r\n     Cunningham, Hood, Johnston of Bossier, Lawrason, Wear, Williamson\r\n     and Wood....\r\n\r\n     Very different was the spirit among the proponents of the Federal\r\n     Amendment in the House. Men who have always been suffragists\r\n     voted for both Federal and State suffrage.... When Senators\r\n     Craven, Johness, Johnson of Franklin and Durr saw the Federal\r\n     Amendment was hopelessly defeated they voted for State\r\n     submission. When Mayor Behrman caught the vision of how a Federal\r\n     Amendment could help him in the September primary, he had\r\n     Senators Davey, Thoele and Roberts vote for it, though it was\r\n     reported that all had said no power on earth could ever make them\r\n     do it. After it was defeated they continued to vote against the\r\n     State amendment. The interpretation put upon their attitude was\r\n     that they would not help it because its success would be\r\n     considered a victory for Mr. Ewing, as his _Daily States_ had\r\n     been the only city paper to stand for State submission. Be it\r\n     said to the credit of Senators Boyer, Butler, Clinton, Doussan,\r\n     Domengeaux, Dugas, Weil and Wilbert that although avowed\r\n     anti-suffragists, they worked hard to secure the submission of\r\n     the State amendment while so-called ardent suffragists worked\r\n     overtime for its defeat.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOUISIANA. PART II.[63]\r\n\r\nLouisiana had no State organization for woman suffrage when in March,\r\n1913, Mrs. A. B. Singletary of Baton Rouge organized there the State\r\nEqual Suffrage League,[64] and in April Mrs. John T. Meehan organized\r\nthe Woman Suffrage Party of Louisiana in New Orleans.[65] Both\r\nenrolled men as well as women, affiliated with the National American\r\nSuffrage Association and worked harmoniously for the enfranchisement\r\nof Louisiana women by State and national legislation. Later the League\r\nbecame the Sixth District branch of the Party. When the Woman Suffrage\r\nParty was organized its platform contained only a pledge to work for\r\nan amendment to the State constitution, but after affiliating with the\r\nNational Association it was pledged to work also for a Federal\r\nSuffrage Amendment, and this was fully understood by the members.\r\n\r\nBy June 15 the Party, with Mrs. Edgar M. Cahn as State chairman, had\r\nenrolled 300 members. It held open air rallies, organized by\r\nlegislative districts, which are known as \"parishes,\" and in the\r\nseventeen wards of Orleans parish congressional chairmen were\r\nappointed by the beginning of 1914. This year the Teachers' Political\r\nEquality Club and the Newcomb College Suffrage Club became branches of\r\nthe Party, and the Orleans Parish Branch was organized. Delegates were\r\nsent to the national suffrage convention at Nashville in November.\r\n\r\nThe first State convention of the Party was held in April, 1915, at\r\nBaton Rouge and Mrs. Meehan was elected chairman. Throughout the\r\nsummer suffragists of all groups campaigned vigorously for the\r\nrecognition of woman suffrage in the State constitutional convention\r\nexpected in the autumn, but the convention itself was voted down at\r\nthe polls. A Men's League was formed and among its members were Dr.\r\nHenry Dickson Bruns, W. A. Kernaghan, M. J. Sanders, Solomon Wolff,\r\nOscar Schumert, I. A. Strauss, J. J. Fineran, Lynn Dinkins, James\r\nWilkinson, Louis J. Bryan, Captain James Dinkins, L. H. Gosserand,\r\nRabbi Max Heller and Rabbi Emil Leipziger.\r\n\r\nIn 1916 the resolution for a constitutional amendment to eliminate the\r\nword \"male\" again failed to pass when introduced by Frank E. Powell of\r\nDe Ridder in the Lower House, though asked for by all the suffrage\r\norganizations, which now included a new group--the Equal Rights\r\nParty--formed by Miss Florence Huberwald. Owing to the absence of Mrs.\r\nMeehan, Mrs. H. B. Myers, vice-chairman, was active head of the party\r\nmost of the year. In November Mrs. Lydia Wickliffe Holmes of Baton\r\nRouge was elected State chairman at the annual convention in New\r\nOrleans. Under her leadership all the groups in accord with the policy\r\nof the National Suffrage Association were merged before the close of\r\n1917, so that the Woman Suffrage Party now included the Equal Suffrage\r\nLeague, the Equal Rights Party and the Louisiana League for Equal\r\nSuffrage, formed the winter before in New Orleans by Mrs. W. J.\r\nO'Donnell. At the annual convention in New Orleans Mrs. Holmes was\r\nre-elected.\r\n\r\nState headquarters, known as Suffrage House, were established in New\r\nOrleans in February, 1918, a large house on St. Charles Avenue, which\r\nwas furnished largely through the efforts of Mrs. O'Donnell, who was\r\nin charge. In May a resolution for a State suffrage amendment,\r\nintroduced in the Upper House by Senator Leon Haas of Opelousas, was\r\ncombined with one brought by Representative Powell in the House, and\r\npassed on June 18, to be submitted to the voters in November. Active\r\ncampaigning for its adoption at the polls began in September under a\r\nJoint Campaign Committee of the Woman Suffrage Party and the State\r\nSuffrage Association. In spite of the influenza epidemic thousands of\r\nsignatures were obtained to a petition asking Governor Ruffin G.\r\nPleasant to issue a proclamation calling on the electors to vote for\r\nit. This he did and those in the State at large responded favorably,\r\nbut their voice was nullified by the adverse votes cast in the\r\nmachine-controlled wards of New Orleans at the behest of Mayor Martin\r\nBehrman, and the amendment was lost by 3,605 votes. The annual\r\nconvention held at Suffrage House in New Orleans after the election\r\nchose Mrs. Holmes again for president.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1919 an attempt was made to secure such a\r\nmodification of the Federal Suffrage Amendment before Congress as\r\nmight meet the objections of southern opponents by removing the fear\r\nof federal interference with elections. An amendment was devised by\r\nAssistant Attorney General Harry Gamble and National Committeeman\r\nRobert Ewing, which would leave its enforcement to the States. They\r\nwent to Washington accompanied by Mrs. Holmes and obtained the consent\r\nof the officers of the National Suffrage Association. Senator Gay of\r\nLouisiana introduced it and it was unanimously reported out of the\r\nCommittee on Woman Suffrage, but the session was just closing and\r\nconsent for a vote on it was refused.\r\n\r\nOn the social side an \"inquiry\" dinner dance given at the Country Club\r\nin New Orleans in May to discuss why Louisiana women were not yet\r\nenfranchised was attended by the Governor and many other prominent\r\npoliticians from all parts of the State. The annual convention was\r\nheld in the autumn at the headquarters, now removed to 417 Royal\r\nStreet, and Mrs. Holmes was elected to her fourth term.[66]\r\n\r\nThe Woman Suffrage Party conducted a vigorous fight for ratification\r\nof the Federal amendment from the opening of the Legislature May 10,\r\n1920, until its defeat on June 15. The final vote for ratification was\r\ngiven by the Legislature of Tennessee in August, which insured the\r\ncomplete suffrage for women in all the States. At the annual\r\nconvention of the Woman Suffrage Party in New Orleans, December 8-9,\r\nits formal dissolution took place, followed immediately by the\r\norganization of the State League of Women Voters, a branch of the\r\nNational League, with Mrs. Philip Weirlein as chairman. The Party's\r\nseven years of work for the enfranchisement of Louisiana women by\r\nState and national legislation were fittingly recognized at a dinner\r\nin the Restaurant de la Louisiane, at which the men and women who had\r\naided the cause in various ways were honored. Prominent men predicted\r\nhappy results of woman's political freedom. Gifts in appreciation of\r\nservices were made to Martin H. Manion, Marshall Ballard and Norris C.\r\nWilliamson. General Robert Georges Nivelle, the hero of Verdun, was\r\npresent and congratulated the women, expressing the hope that ere long\r\nthe women of France would gain their political liberty. A silver vase\r\nwas presented to the retiring chairman, Mrs. Holmes, from her fellow\r\nworkers, and she was unanimously chosen honorary chairman of the new\r\nleague.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. On the eve of departure for the national convention in\r\nFebruary, 1920, Mrs. Holmes, chairman of the Woman Suffrage Party,\r\nwent to John M. Parker, who had just been nominated for Governor by\r\nthe Democratic party, and asked: \"If the thirty-sixth State ratifies\r\nthe Federal Suffrage Amendment while we are in Chicago will you send\r\nMrs. Carrie Chapman Catt a telegram of congratulations?\" To this he\r\nanswered: \"You write a message and sign my name to it--I'll stand for\r\nanything you may say.\" \"If, however, the amendment is not ratified and\r\nit becomes necessary for Louisiana to make the fight for it,\" Mrs.\r\nHolmes continued, \"what must I tell Mrs. Catt you will do?\" \"Just say\r\nto her,\" he replied, \"that I am a suffragist, and she will\r\nunderstand.\" Mr. Parker had joined the Progressive party in 1912 and\r\nin 1916 he had made a campaign as its candidate for vice-president on\r\na platform that strongly endorsed the Federal Suffrage Amendment, so\r\nhis support of ratification was fully expected.\r\n\r\nOn their return from the convention the leaders of the Party began to\r\nline up the important men of the State by letter and by personal\r\ninterviews. Beginning with the ex-Governors, they secured the\r\nendorsement of L. E. Hall, H. C. Warmoth, N. C. Blanchard, Jared Y.\r\nSanders and W. W. Heard. Against these, however, was the present\r\nGovernor, Ruffin G. Pleasant, who took an aggressive stand for State's\r\nrights, although at a public banquet eight months earlier he had told\r\nthe women that 'if Louisiana women could not obtain the ballot by\r\nState enactment he would favor Federal action.' Among those who\r\ndeclared for ratification were J. J. Bailey, Paul Capdeville, F. R.\r\nGrace, T. R. Harris, A. V. Coco, Semmes Walmsley, Rufus E. Foster,\r\nHowell Morgan, Percy Saint, E. N. Stafford, Phanor Breazeale,\r\nDonaldson Caffery and many other men of affairs. The New Orleans\r\n_Item_ had always advocated woman suffrage and the Federal Amendment\r\nespecially; the _Times-Picayune_ now approved ratification, as did\r\nnearly all the papers in the State. The Orleans Democratic\r\nAssociation, which had put Governor Parker in office, passed a\r\nresolution endorsing it. The State Central Committee chairman, Frank\r\nJ. Looney, and the National Democratic Committeeman, Arsene Pujo, were\r\nin favor, and North Louisiana was almost solid for it. The opposition\r\nwas chiefly in New Orleans, where certain elements under ward-boss\r\nleadership were opposed to woman suffrage in any form.\r\n\r\nMrs. Holmes had a number of interviews with Governor-elect Parker\r\nalone, with other women and with Marshall Ballard, editor of the\r\n_Item_, one of his valued supporters. She was always led to believe\r\nthat he would help when the time for it came, although some of his\r\nstrongest adherents were opposed to ratification. It was deemed best\r\nto make the fight along non-partisan lines, and so he was asked if it\r\nwould be wiser to have two of his own supporters take charge of it or\r\nto have one who had opposed him in the primary campaign. He advised\r\nthe latter course and Norris C. Williamson of East Carroll parish, his\r\nopponent, was selected to introduce the bill in the Senate, and S. O.\r\nShattuck of Calcasieu, a supporter and the introducer of the first\r\nwoman suffrage bill in the Legislature in the Lower House. The day\r\nMayor Martin Behrman came out for ratification, Mr. Parker said to\r\nMrs. Holmes: \"I have always been for woman suffrage any way it could\r\nbe obtained and I have never understood a suffragist's taking any\r\nother stand.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in March Governor-elect Parker told a group of suffragists that\r\nthe women should get together on a program for the Legislature if they\r\nwished to be successful. Acting on this suggestion the Party publicly\r\ninvited all suffrage organizations to come together and form a Joint\r\nRatification Committee. Men and women from all parts of the State\r\nattended this meeting on April 7 and one of the speakers, Charles\r\nRosen, pledged Parker to ratification, while Marshall Ballard vouched\r\nfor the authenticity of his statement. The bodies that composed this\r\ncommittee were the Natchitoches Equal Rights Club, represented by Mrs.\r\nS. J. Henry; the Shreveport Suffrage Club by Mrs. J. D. and Mrs. W. A.\r\nWilkinson; the Louisiana branch of the National Woman's Party, by Mrs.\r\nM. R. Bankston, Mrs. E. J. Graham, Mrs. Rosella Bayhi; the Woman\r\nSuffrage Party by Mrs. Joseph Devereux, Mrs. J. E. Friend. Mrs. Holmes\r\nwas made chairman, headquarters were taken in Baton Rouge and 46\r\nlobbyists were at the Capitol day and night during the session.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Baton Rouge the women saw the \"anti\" forces lining up with\r\nthe \"State's rights\" advocates and witnessed the curious spectacle of\r\nwomen who had worked for woman suffrage for a generation allying\r\nthemselves with the paid organizers of the National Association\r\nOpposed to Woman Suffrage, headed by Miss Charlotte Rowe of Yonkers,\r\nN. Y., its field secretary. Ex-Governor Pleasant and his wife came out\r\nas leaders of the opposition, assisted by the Misses Kate and Jean\r\nGordon and other advocates of State action.[67] It was early seen that\r\nthe fight for the Speakership might endanger the ratification program\r\nand the women were careful to take no part in it. R. F. Walker was\r\nchosen, an unfortunate choice for the suffragists, for he leaned\r\nstrongly toward the \"anti\" side in his rulings, as did Lieutenant\r\nGovernor Hewitt Bouanchaud.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough in his campaign speeches in the autumn Mr. Parker had\r\nrepeatedly said: \"I am for suffrage; it is almost here, and we must\r\nhave it,\" his platform as sent into some of the parishes had contained\r\na \"State's rights\" plank, designed, with or without his knowledge, by\r\nsome of his backers, to placate those who feared the Federal Amendment\r\non account of its supposed effect on the negro question. This was not\r\nknown to the ratification leaders and therefore he created great\r\nconsternation by announcing shortly before his inauguration that he\r\n\"was going to keep his hands off the suffrage fight; that it was a\r\nmatter for the Legislature.\" After the Speakership contest was over he\r\nrefused to receive a delegation of women and declined to allow any\r\nmember of the Ratification Committee to approach him. On May 10, 1920,\r\nthe General Assembly convened in Baton Rouge and on the 11th the rival\r\nwoman suffrage bills were introduced. Representative L. L. Upton\r\npresented the State amendment in the House. The Federal amendment\r\nmeasure was a joint resolution. The attention of the country was\r\ncentered on the fight in Louisiana. Thirty-five State Legislatures had\r\nratified and the Republicans were claiming the credit. Democratic\r\nleaders were very desirous of having it for the final ratification.\r\nAppeals were sent out to prominent Democrats within and without the\r\nState for help in putting it through. Colonel William J. Bryan was\r\none of the first to respond, urging it to help the Democratic party in\r\nthe coming campaign. Senator Williamson called on the new \"convert,\"\r\nMayor Behrman, and he appealed to the New Orleans \"organization\"\r\nSenators, but was not entirely successful.\r\n\r\nOn May 13 Governor Pleasant submitted the Federal Amendment to both\r\nHouses, with a message which filled several columns of print, urging\r\nthem not to adopt it but to pass in its stead the resolution for a\r\nState amendment. On the 16th, Senator N. C. Simmons, a former leader\r\nof the anti-suffrage forces, issued an appeal for ratification,\r\nridiculing Governor Pleasant's \"negro peril\" bugaboo. This same day\r\nMrs. George Bass, chairman of the Women's National Democratic\r\nCommittee, came to Baton Rouge at the request of the Joint\r\nRatification Committee and addressed a large meeting in the Istrouma\r\nHotel in favor of it.\r\n\r\nJohn M. Parker was inaugurated Governor May 17. The next day he\r\nreceived a telegram from President Woodrow Wilson which said: \"May I\r\nnot very respectfully urge your favorable interest and influence in\r\nthe matter of the Federal Suffrage Amendment? It seems to be of the\r\ndeepest national significance and importance.\" The Governor answered\r\nthat he found a great difference of opinion among the legislators,\r\nlarge numbers opposed to any form, and, all being Democrats, any\r\ndictation on his part would be unwise.\r\n\r\nEfforts made by the \"antis\" to force an immediate vote on the Federal\r\nAmendment failed and it was decided that all suffrage bills should\r\ntake the usual course and be referred to committees for hearings.\r\nWomen thronged the capital. On June 2 the House passed the Upton bill\r\nfor State suffrage by 93 ayes to 17 noes. That same night a hearing\r\nbefore the Joint Committees on Federal Relations was held, which\r\nlasted five hours, with some notable speeches. S. O. Shattuck, Phanor\r\nBreazeale, Percy Saint, Judge Rufus E. Foster, Congressman Jared Y.\r\nSanders, Mrs. Holmes, Mrs. Bass, Mrs. E. J. Graham, Miss Florence\r\nHuberwald, Mrs. Joseph Devereux and Mrs. M. R. Bankston appeared for\r\nthe Federal Amendment, while the opposition was voiced by Senator\r\nStewart, ex-Governor Pleasant, Miss Kate Gordon, and Miss Charlotte\r\nRowe. On June 4, the Federal Amendment was reported favorably in the\r\nSenate. \"Get suffrage out of the way\" became the slogan, but neither\r\nside was ready to risk a vote. The Federal bill was passed to third\r\nreading. On June 8 former Speaker of Congress Champ Clark addressed\r\nthe General Assembly and urged its ratification as an act of justice\r\nto women and a great benefit to Louisiana and the Democratic party.\r\nThe next day the vote on ratification was indefinitely postponed by a\r\nvote of 22 to 19 in the Senate while the Upton bill was returned to\r\nthe House calendar.\r\n\r\nOn June 14, Homer Cummings, chairman of the Democratic National\r\nCommittee, wired Behrman urging his help on the ground of party\r\nadvantage, to which the Mayor replied that he was doing all he could.\r\nOn June 15 the ratification of the Federal Amendment was defeated in\r\nthe House by a vote of 67 noes to 44 ayes, and Representative Jordan\r\nthen introduced a resolution definitely rejecting it, which was passed\r\nby 60 ayes to 29 noes. The House declined to hear Congressman John E.\r\nRaker of California on the ground that they had heard enough on woman\r\nsuffrage. The Upton bill for a State amendment was defeated in the\r\nSenate by 23 noes to 16 ayes on June 17.\r\n\r\nOn June 18, Representative Conrad Meyer sought to re-introduce the\r\nFederal measure but permission was refused by 61 to 18, while a motion\r\nto re-consider the Upton bill passed the Senate by 18 to 12. Every\r\npossible pressure was brought to bear by the Governor's forces to\r\nsecure its passage. All kinds of tactics and tricks were employed but\r\non July 7 it was again defeated, lacking one vote of the necessary\r\ntwo-thirds. Those who were making the fight for the Federal Amendment\r\nfinally appealed to Governor James M. Cox of Ohio, Democratic nominee\r\nfor President, to use his influence. On July 7 he sent a telegram\r\nurging the ratification and saying that \"the Legislature owed such\r\naction to the Democratic party.\" A strong effort was made to obtain\r\nanother vote but it failed by 46 ayes, 52 noes, and the Legislature\r\nadjourned on July 8 with the record of having defeated both\r\nratification and a resolution to let the voters decide on amending the\r\nState constitution for woman suffrage. Senator Williamson issued a\r\nstatement saying: \"There was never a time during the entire session\r\nwhen Governor Parker could not have had the Federal Amendment\r\nratified and he is the only man in the State who could have done it.\r\nHe had control of both House and Senate and when he went after\r\nanything with all his force he did not fail to get it.\"\r\n\r\nThe last day of the session Mrs. Holmes, chairman of the Joint\r\nRatification Committee, went to Governor Parker and told him that she\r\nwould place the blame where it belonged; that the women had helped put\r\nhim in office and he had not stood by them, to which he answered: \"Go\r\nto it.\" She therefore issued a statement on July 15 saying in part:\r\n\"The responsibility for the failure of this Federal Amendment to\r\nenfranchise 27,000,000 women, including those of Louisiana, rests on\r\nGovernor John M. Parker. This assertion is borne out by every woman\r\nwho lobbied at Baton Rouge and by all the fair-minded men. It was in\r\nhis power to secure ratification the day the session opened; it was in\r\nhis power the day Woodrow Wilson wired and asked his support; it was\r\nin his power when Governor Cox sent his request. The women, who, in\r\ntheir zeal for a broad-visioned progressive leader of clean, honest\r\ncharacteristics, did all in their power to elect him Governor--those\r\nare the women who in sorrow today must realize that it is the only\r\nthing he stood for that he did not 'put across.'\" ...\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[57] The History is indebted for this chapter to Miss Kate M.

In August, 1900, a convention of the State association\r\nwith a \"suffrage day\" was held at Ocean Park, Old Orchard Beach,\r\nattended by Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, president of the National\r\nAmerican Woman Suffrage Association. This year under the presidency of\r\nMrs. Lucy Hobart Day, organized work was systematically begun, with\r\nmeetings in eight or ten towns. State conventions were held annually\r\nfor the next twenty years, in October with but four exceptions.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 special attention was given to enrollment and new sections of\r\nthe State were reached in this way. The literature and press\r\ndepartments also extended their work. The summer assembly at Ocean\r\nPark made \"suffrage day\" a part of its regular program. At the\r\nconvention held at Saco in 1902 plans were made to ask the next\r\nsession of the Legislature to grant Municipal suffrage to taxpaying\r\nwomen. The State Grange passed a resolution in favor of this measure,\r\nplaced woman suffrage on its convention program and from that time\r\ngave active support to the movement.\r\n\r\nThe State convention took place at Auburn in 1903 and the association\r\nbecame an incorporated body that year. The organization of county\r\nleagues was begun in 1904 and a successful convention was held in\r\nPortland. In 1905 after eight years of efficient service, Mrs. Day\r\nretired from the presidency. She had organized several departments in\r\nthe association and was in charge of the campaign to secure Municipal\r\nsuffrage for taxpaying women. Mrs. Fannie J. Fernald was elected as\r\nher successor at the convention held at Old Orchard Beach. She\r\ntravelled extensively over the State, speaking before Granges and\r\nother organizations and securing their interest and endorsement. She\r\nalso had charge of the legislative work.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 woman suffrage was endorsed by the Maine Federation of Labor,\r\nan important accession. The annual convention again was welcomed in\r\nSaco. At the convention of 1907 in Farmington it was voted to support\r\nthe National American Association in its efforts to secure a Federal\r\nSuffrage Amendment. A department of church work was established. In\r\n1908 at the convention in Portland it was arranged to petition\r\nCongress for the submission of this amendment. In 1909 and 1910 the\r\nusual propaganda work was continued under the presidency of Mrs.\r\nFernald and the usual State conventions were held at Old Orchard and\r\nPortland. In 1911 Mrs. Fernald left the State and the Rev. Alfreda\r\nBrewster Wallace was elected president at the convention in Portland.\r\n\r\nThe association increased in size and interest and at the convention\r\nof 1912 in Portland Miss Helen N. Bates of that city was elected\r\npresident with a very capable board. At this time the association\r\nbegan to do more aggressive work in personally urging the members of\r\nCongress to support the Federal Amendment. Miss Bates acted as\r\nchairman of the Congressional Committee until the submission of the\r\namendment, when the favorable vote of every member of the Maine\r\ndelegation had been secured.\r\n\r\nIn 1913 the College Equal Suffrage League was formed to help the\r\nassociation in its legislative work, with Mrs. Leslie R. Rounds as\r\npresident. The annual convention took place at Portland this year and\r\nthe next, and in 1915 at Kennebunk. Many newspapers in the State had\r\nbecome favorable to suffrage and propaganda was carried on through\r\nfairs, moving pictures, street speaking, etc. In 1914 the Men's Equal\r\nSuffrage League was formed with Robert Treat Whitehouse of Portland\r\npresident and Ralph O. Brewster secretary. Many leading men of the\r\nState joined this League, which helped in the legislative and campaign\r\nwork. The Methodist Episcopal Church endorsed woman suffrage at its\r\nstate conference.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1916, a Congressional conference was held in Portland in\r\nthe interest of the Federal Amendment, with Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt\r\nin attendance and speaking at public meetings with Mrs. Maud Wood Park\r\nand Mrs. Glendower Evans. It was attended by women from all parts of\r\nthe State and as a result of the great interest aroused many new\r\nleagues were organized. Miss Bates resigned on account of ill health\r\nin March and her term of office was finished by Mrs. Augusta M. Hunt\r\nof Portland, who had always been deeply interested in the suffrage\r\ncause. The National Association sent Mrs. Augusta Hughston, one of its\r\nfield directors, to put into operation a state-wide plan of\r\norganization. At the State convention in Portland in October Mrs.\r\nKatharine Reed Balentine, daughter of the Hon. Thomas B. Reed, was\r\nelected president. The outlook seemed favorable for securing the\r\nsubmission of a suffrage amendment to the voters. This year Mrs.\r\nDeborah Knox Livingston of Bangor was appointed State organizer and\r\nlegislative chairman and work begun for this purpose.\r\n\r\nFrom January 8th to 20th, 1917, the National American Association held\r\na suffrage school in Portland to prepare for the expected campaign.\r\nThe instructors were Mrs. Nettie R. Shuler and Mrs. Halsey W. Wilson,\r\nits corresponding and recording secretaries, and Mrs. T. T. Cotnam.\r\nThe subjects taught were Suffrage History and Argument, Organization,\r\nPublicity and Press, Money Raising and Parliamentary Law. This school\r\nwas attended by suffragists from different sections of the State.\r\nLater Mrs. Edward S. Anthoine and Mrs. Henry W. Cobb of the State\r\nassociation carried on suffrage schools in other towns and cities. On\r\nFebruary 9, 10, Mrs. Catt went to Portland to attend a board meeting\r\nof the association at the home of the president, Mrs. Balentine, to\r\nconfer on the approaching campaign.\r\n\r\nCAMPAIGN. In February, 1917, urged by the suffrage leaders, the\r\nLegislature submitted the amendment. This had been done against the\r\nurgent advice of Mrs. Catt, the national president, who knew of the\r\nslight organization there, and she wrote to them Oct. 9, 1916: \"If\r\nMaine goes into a campaign for 1918 with the chances largely against\r\nsuccess, we feel that it would be a general damage to the cause and a\r\nwaste of money. If it would plan instead to go into a campaign in\r\n1919, taking three years for preparation, we should feel that it was\r\nfar more certain of victory. Let us look at the resources you need to\r\nget and which you have not yet secured: (1) a fund to begin with of at\r\nleast $5,000 or $6,000; (2) at least five State officers who can give\r\npractically all of their time, with the determination to win as many\r\nother people to the same sacrifice as they are making themselves. I\r\nmost earnestly recommend that you ask your Legislature this year for\r\nMunicipal and Presidential suffrage, making a good strong campaign for\r\nthis, which it can grant without referring it to the voters.\"\r\n\r\nA copy of this letter was sent to the president of the association and\r\nat its annual convention held in October it was read and a long\r\ndiscussion followed. A delegate thus reported it: \"Only a few\r\ndelegates agreed with her. Many women never having been in a campaign\r\ndeclared that victory was sure. The convention almost unanimously\r\nvoted for the referendum and when the vote had been taken and the\r\ncheers had subsided, the grand sum of $500 was raised for the\r\ncampaign....\" Nevertheless the National Association at its next\r\nconvention (still believing that the referendum would not be submitted\r\nuntil 1918), voted to back the Maine campaign, although against the\r\njudgment of Mrs. Catt.[69]\r\n\r\nAt the request of the Maine association the National Association made\r\nit possible for Mrs. Deborah Knox Livingston to take the position of\r\ncampaign manager. Through her extensive work for the Woman's Christian\r\nTemperance Union she was widely acquainted in church, club and\r\nsuffrage circles, was experienced in campaigning and an eloquent\r\nspeaker. In her report after the election she said: \"Maine presented\r\nas difficult a field for the conducting of a suffrage campaign as has\r\never been faced by any group of suffragists in any part of the\r\ncountry. The referendum was submitted the very last of February and as\r\nthe election came so early in September only about six months' time\r\nwas given us for the campaign. Deducting from this time the months of\r\nApril and May, on account of the almost impossible condition of the\r\nroads, and June with its heavy rains, there was left but little more\r\nthan three months for active work. Early in the campaign our country\r\nentered the World War, and the whole thought and attention of the\r\npeople were given to securing support for the Liberty Bonds, Red\r\nCross, Navy League and other patriotic and preparedness work. This\r\ngreatly handicapped us in the raising of finances and the creating of\r\norganization, the two foundations upon which the structure of a\r\nsuccessful campaign must be built, and the two things which more than\r\nanything else the State of Maine needed, so far as the amendment was\r\nconcerned.\"\r\n\r\nA campaign committee was formed from members of organizations in the\r\nState in favor of suffrage, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union,\r\nFederation of Women's Clubs, Men's Suffrage League, Civic League,\r\nReferendum League, the Grange and the State Suffrage Association, and\r\nheadquarters were established in Bangor. There were only fourteen\r\nsuffrage societies in the State, not all active. Eleven of the sixteen\r\ncounties had an organizer in charge for the last six weeks and 269\r\nlocal committees were formed in the different towns but many of them\r\nwere ineffectual, as they were made up of untrained women and the time\r\nwas too short to train them. The argument for suffrage, however, was\r\nput before the voters very thoroughly. One hundred thousand were\r\ncircularized with the convincing speeches of U. S. Senator Shafroth of\r\nColorado and later with a leaflet Have You Heard the News? which\r\ncarried the strong appeal of the suffrage gains over the entire world.\r\nHouse to house distribution of \"fliers\" was made in many communities.\r\nAltogether 1,500,000 leaflets were distributed, ten to every voter in\r\nthe State. In hundreds of towns there was absolute ignorance on the\r\nsubject. The clergy were circularized three times--over a thousand of\r\nthem--the State Grange twice, committees of the political parties and\r\nmembers of the Legislature twice.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a committee was organized petition blanks were sent to it\r\nand in this short space of time the names of over 38,000 women of\r\nvoting age asking for the suffrage were obtained, nearly all by\r\nvolunteer canvassers. The names from each county were sent to the\r\nvoters from that county and 100,000 received these lists. The\r\npetitions did a vast amount of educational work among the women and\r\nanswered the men who insisted that the women did not want to vote.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers on the whole were favorable. Especial mention should be\r\nmade of the valuable assistance continued throughout the campaign of\r\nthe Lewiston _Journal_, Portland _Argus_, Kennebec _Journal_,\r\nBrunswick _Record_ and Waldo County _Herald_. The Portland Express\r\ngave editorial support. The Bangor Commercial, owned and edited by\r\nJohn P. Bass, made a bitter fight against the amendment and refused\r\ngenerally to publish even letters on the other side. It would not\r\npublish President Wilson's letter even as a paid advertisement. From\r\nJuly 1 to September 10 Mrs. Rose L. Geyer, a member of the staff of\r\nthe _Woman Citizen_, official organ of the National Suffrage\r\nAssociation, conducted the publicity work in connection with Miss\r\nFlorence L. Nye, the State press chairman. On August 18 the Lewiston\r\n_Journal_ issued a supplement for the State association, edited by\r\nMiss Helen N. Bates, of which 65,000 copies were distributed through\r\ntwenty-two newspapers.\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson sent a letter to Mrs. Livingston on September 4\r\nappealing to Democratic voters as follows: \"May I not express through\r\nyou my very great interest in the equal suffrage campaign in Maine?\r\nThe pledges of my party are very distinct in favor of granting the\r\nsuffrage to women by State action and I would like to have the\r\nprivilege of urging all Democrats to support a cause in which we all\r\nbelieve.\" On September 8 former President Roosevelt sent the following\r\ntelegram addressed to the Campaign Committee: \"I earnestly hope that\r\nas a matter of plain justice the people of Maine will vote 'yes' on\r\nwoman suffrage.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter and telegram were put on the moving picture screens, which\r\nwere also used in other ways for propaganda. The poster sent by the\r\nNational Association and those printed by the Campaign Committee,\r\nfastened on trees, fences, windows and every available space, carried\r\nthe message to all passers by. Mrs. Livingston said in her report: \"We\r\ncan not express too gratefully our appreciation of the value of the\r\nwork accomplished by the experienced organizers sent to us by the\r\nNational Association and by Massachusetts, New Hampshire,\r\nPennsylvania and Rhode Island; of that of Mrs. Mary G. Canfield of\r\nVermont, who gave her services for one month; and of the untiring and\r\nsuccessful labors of Mrs. Augusta M. Hunt, who had charge of York and\r\nCumberland counties.\"\r\n\r\nThe entire State was thoroughly covered by public meetings, over 500\r\nbeing held during the last three months. It would be impossible to\r\ngive the names of all who spoke at these meetings but among the more\r\nprominent were Governor Carl E. Milliken, U. S. Senator Bert Fernald,\r\nformer Senator Charles F. Johnson, Representative Ira G. Hersey,\r\nformer Representative Frank E. Guernsey; among the members of the\r\nLegislature and other influential men, former Attorney General W. R.\r\nPattangall, Judge Robert Treat Whitehouse, Ralph O. Brewster, Frank W.\r\nButler, Daniel A. Poling, the Rev. Arthur L. Weatherly. On July 23,\r\n24, in Augusta, and July 25, 27, in Bangor, Mrs. Catt and Mrs. Shuler\r\naddressed mass meetings in the evenings and held conferences with the\r\nworkers through the days. In September Mrs. Catt gave a week to\r\nspeaking at public meetings in various cities. Other speakers were\r\nMrs. Lucia Ames Mead, Miss Elizabeth Upham Yates, Dr. Lee Anna Starr,\r\nMrs. Sara A. Gilson, Miss Emma L. McAlarney, Miss Anne E. Coughlin and\r\nthe Misses Loitman. The members of the Men's League were active and\r\nhelpful. The mass meetings were well attended and in all the cities\r\nand many of the towns street meetings were very successful. Mrs.\r\nLivingston travelled more than 20,000 miles in the State, delivered\r\n150 addresses and raised over $4,000.\r\n\r\nNot in any other State campaign had the women anti-suffragists taken\r\nso conspicuous a part. There was a society of considerable social\r\nprominence in Portland and the associations in Massachusetts and New\r\nYork sent nearly twenty speakers and workers, all women except J. B.\r\nMaling of Colorado and Charles McLean of Iowa, whose utterances had\r\nmore than once been repudiated by the men and women of their States.\r\nMrs. James W. Wadsworth, Jr., president of the National Association,\r\naddressed parlor meetings. Toward the end of the campaign their\r\nnumbers became much less, as they learned that the \"machines\" of both\r\npolitical parties expected to defeat the amendment.\r\n\r\nThe election took place Sept. 10, 1917, and the amendment received\r\n38,838 noes, 20,684 ayes--lost by 18,154, the negative majority nearly\r\ntwo to one. About half as many men voted for it as the number of women\r\nwho signed a petition for it. Mrs. Livingston gave as the principal\r\nreasons for the defeat: 1. Inherent conservatism and prejudice. 2.\r\nResentment at the \"picketing\" of the White House by the \"militant\"\r\nsuffragists. 3. Briefness of the campaign. 4. Inability because of\r\nlack of organization to reach the rural vote. 5. Reactionaries of both\r\nparties uniting in opposition.[70]\r\n\r\nIn her summing up Mrs. Livingston said: \"Without the aid of the\r\nNational American Association the campaign would have been impossible.\r\nThe magnificent generosity with which it furnished speakers,\r\norganizers, posters and literature will make the women of Maine\r\nforever its debtors.[71]\r\n\r\nAt the convention of the State Association in September, 1917, in\r\nAugusta, Miss Mabel Connor was chosen president and at the conventions\r\nof 1918 in Lewiston and 1919 in Portland was re-elected. At the\r\nconvention in October, 1918, having recovered somewhat from its\r\ndefeat, the association voted to introduce a bill for the Presidential\r\nsuffrage in the next Legislature in 1919. The Legislative Committee\r\nconsisted of Mrs. Balentine, chairman; Miss Connor, Miss Bates, Mrs.\r\nPattangall, Mrs. Cobb and Mrs. Guy P. Gannett, with Miss Lola Walker\r\nas executive secretary to the chairman.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. The State Suffrage Association and the State\r\nWoman's Christian Temperance Union always worked for woman suffrage\r\nmeasures in the Legislature in cordial cooperation, beginning in 1887.\r\n\r\n1901. Suffrage bills did not come out of committee.\r\n\r\n1903. A bill was introduced for Municipal suffrage for tax-paying\r\nwomen by Representative George H. Allan of Portland. The Joint\r\nStanding Committee eliminated \"taxpaying\" and reported a bill giving\r\nMunicipal suffrage to all women. The State Suffrage Association did an\r\nenormous amount of work in behalf of this bill, sending letters to\r\n15,000 women representing 239 cities and towns who were paying taxes\r\non approximately $25,000,000. Several thousand answers urging the bill\r\nwere received, coming from every county and from 237 of the cities and\r\ntowns. It was lost in the Senate by a tie and in the House by a vote\r\nof 110 noes, 29 ayes.\r\n\r\n1905, 1907, 1909, no suffrage bills were reported out of committee.\r\n\r\n1911. Four members of the Judiciary Committee made a minority report\r\nin favor of the suffrage measure and the House voted to substitute the\r\nminority report but the Senate refused to concur.\r\n\r\n1913. A new resolve asking for submission of a suffrage amendment was\r\ndrafted by George H. Allan and introduced in the Senate by Ira G.\r\nHersey, which gave a vote of 23 ayes, 6 noes. In the House the vote\r\nwas 89 ayes, 53 noes--only six more votes needed for the necessary\r\ntwo-thirds.\r\n\r\n1915. A joint resolution to submit a full suffrage amendment passed\r\nthe Senate by 26 ayes, 4 noes; the House vote by 88 ayes, 59 noes--ten\r\nmore votes needed for the two-thirds. Introduced by Representative\r\nLauren M. Sanborn.\r\n\r\n1917. The resolution was adopted in the House February 21 by 112 ayes,\r\n35 noes; unanimously adopted by the Senate February 22. In signing it\r\nthe next day Governor Carl E. Milliken said to the suffrage leaders:\r\n\"You have appealed to reason and not to prejudice. Your campaign has\r\nbeen a very fine example of what a campaign should be.\" The amendment\r\nwas defeated at the polls in September.\r\n\r\n1919. In March an Act granting women the right to vote for\r\nPresidential Electors, prepared by George H. Allan, was introduced in\r\nthe Senate by Guy P. Gannett of Augusta and in the House by Percival\r\nP. Baxter of Portland. The joint committee by 8 to 2 reported \"ought\r\nto pass.\" The hearing before the Judiciary Committee was called one of\r\nthe best ever held. Lewis A. Burleigh of Augusta, editor of the\r\nKennebec _Journal_, and Professor Frank E. Woodruff of Bowdoin College\r\nmade the principal speeches. Telegrams were read from U. S. Senator\r\nFernald and Representatives Ira G. Hersey, John A. Peters and Wallace\r\nH. White, Jr., urging the passage of the bill. The \"antis\" were\r\npresent in force and made a hard fight. They were fully answered by\r\nMrs. Nancy M. Schoonmaker of Connecticut. An effort was made to attach\r\na clause to the bill referring it to the voters but it was thwarted,\r\nSenator Leroy R. Folsom of Norridgewock making a strong speech against\r\nit. In the House a still more determined effort was made to secure a\r\nreferendum but it did not succeed. Speeches were made by Frederick W.\r\nHinckley, Percival F. Baxter and Elisha W. Pike, legislators, and Mrs.\r\nKatharine Reed Balentine, chairman of the Legislative Committee, and\r\nMiss Mabel Connor, president of the State Suffrage Association. On\r\nFebruary 26 the bill passed the Senate by a vote of 25 ayes, 6 noes.\r\nOn March 19 it passed the House by 85 ayes, 54 noes.\r\n\r\nThe favorable vote was obtained after six months of quiet, continuous\r\nand intensive political work by the Legislative Committee. Members of\r\nthe Legislature worked for the success of the bill; the Governor\r\nsupported it and the press was largely in favor.\r\n\r\nThe anti-suffragists immediately announced their proposal to bring the\r\nPresidential Suffrage Law before the voters under the initiative and\r\nreferendum, upon petition of at least 10,000 legal voters filed within\r\na specified time. The effort to secure these names lagged and without\r\ndoubt would have been given up had it not been for Frank E. Mace,\r\nformer State Forest Commissioner, who organized committees all over\r\nthe State at the eleventh hour and petitions bearing 12,000\r\nsignatures were filed July 3, within 90 days after the Legislature\r\nadjourned, as required. As there was doubt about the constitutionality\r\nof this referendum, the State Supreme Court, on July 9, 1919, was\r\nrequested by Governor Milliken to decide. On August 6 the Court\r\nrendered its decision that the Act came within the provisions of the\r\ninitiative and referendum. As the petition did not ask for a special\r\nelection the Governor sent out a proclamation for the referendum to be\r\nsubmitted at the next general election Sept. 13, 1920. The Federal\r\nSuffrage Amendment was declared to be adopted on August 26 but there\r\nwas no way in which the referendum could legally be omitted from the\r\nballot. Therefore on September 13 the women, already having full\r\nsuffrage, went to the polls to vote on getting partial suffrage and\r\nthe official count showed 88,080 ayes, 30,462 noes.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. Governor Milliken called a special session of the\r\nLegislature for November, 1919. In his message he recommended the\r\nratification of the Federal Amendment in the strongest possible\r\nmanner, saying that if only one woman in Maine wanted to vote she\r\nshould have the chance. The anti-suffrage forces of the entire country\r\nwere concentrated on Maine at this time to prevent ratification and it\r\nwas with the greatest difficulty that a movement to postpone action\r\nuntil the regular session was defeated. The amendment was ratified in\r\nthe Senate on November 4 by 24 ayes, 5 noes; in the House on November\r\n5 by 72 ayes, 68 noes. After the vote was taken an attempt to\r\nreconsider was made but was unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe same Legislative Committee of women that had charge of the\r\nPresidential bill had charge of the ratification.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the annual convention of the State Suffrage Association in Portland\r\nin October, 1919, it was voted to hold a School for Citizenship at\r\nBates College in August, 1920. Mrs. George M. Chase was made chairman\r\nof the Committee of Arrangements and the work was largely carried out\r\nby Miss Rosamond Connor, 100 women from many parts of the State\r\nattending and deriving much benefit. Mrs. Nancy M. Schoonmaker was the\r\nprincipal instructor. At a meeting of the association in Augusta on\r\nNovember 12 it was merged into the League of Women Voters with Miss\r\nMabel Connor as chairman.\r\n\r\nSuffrage work in Maine was carried on for many years in the face of\r\nthe greatest obstacles but there was always a small group of devoted\r\nwomen willing to make any sacrifice for the cause, who carried the\r\ntorch until another group could take it, and every step gained was\r\nfought for. The history would be incomplete without mention of the\r\nPortland Equal Franchise League, of which Mrs. Arthur L. Bates was\r\npresident, which for many years was the backbone of the State\r\nassociation. The list of State officers who freely gave their services\r\nis too long to publish. Among other prominent workers not already\r\nmentioned were Dr. Jennie Fuller of Hartland; Mrs. Zenas Thompson and\r\nMiss Susan Clark of Portland; Mrs. Isabel Greenwood of Farmington;\r\nMiss Anna L.

B. Dessy of Bar Harbor; E. C. Reynolds of South\r\nPortland.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[68] The History is indebted for this chapter to Miss Caroline Colvin,\r\nProfessor of History in the State University, Miss Helen N. Bates,\r\npresident of the State Woman Suffrage Association, 1912-1916, and Miss\r\nMabel Connor, president, 1917-1919.\r\n\r\n[69] The above paragraphs have been copied for the sake of historical\r\naccuracy from an official report of the national corresponding\r\nsecretary.--Ed.\r\n\r\n[70] Mrs. Clarence Hale, State president of the anti-suffrage\r\norganization, issued the following: \"The large majority vote cast\r\nagainst suffrage today must indicate, as did the great vote of\r\nMassachusetts in 1915, that the East is not in favor of the entrance\r\nof women into political life. The result should satisfy the\r\nsuffragists for all time and they should now practice the principles\r\nof democracy and fairness, which they are so ready to preach, by\r\nrefraining from further disputing the will of the people.... We can\r\nnow return to give our services to the State and the nation in woman's\r\nnormal way.\"\r\n\r\nOn November 7 the \"East\" spoke again when the voters of New York by a\r\nmajority of 102,353 gave full suffrage to women.\r\n\r\n[71] Besides paying the expenses of the suffrage school, the National\r\nAssociation paid the salary of Mrs. Deborah Knox Livingston as\r\ncampaign manager; the salary of Miss Lola Walker from February 10 to\r\nSeptember 10; the salaries of eight other organizers who worked for\r\nvarying periods and the expenses of four; for 120,000 Shafroth\r\nspeeches; circularized 1,200 of the Protestant and Catholic clergy;\r\nprepared especially for Maine 125,000 baby fliers and 100,000 copies\r\nof Have You Heard? and furnished envelopes and stamps for them; 14,000\r\npieces of literature for advanced suffragists; 1,000 copies of Do You\r\nKnow? to circularize the politicians; 400 each of thirteen different\r\nkinds of posters; 500 war measure fliers; 2,000 blue and yellow\r\nposters. The Leslie Commission contributed the services of Mrs. Geyer\r\nfor press work from July 1 to September 10. This campaign cost the\r\nNational Association $10,282 and the Leslie Commission $4,986, a total\r\nof $15,268.--Ed.\r\n\r\n[72] Among the active workers in the Anti-Suffrage Association were\r\nMesdames John F.

PART I.[73]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the fourth volume of the History of Woman Suffrage closed in 1900\r\nit left the Maryland association just eleven years old. Since 1894,\r\nwhen the Montgomery County and the Baltimore City Associations united,\r\nit has been represented by accredited delegates in every national\r\nconvention. These thirty-one years of organized effort by no means\r\nrepresent all of the suffrage agitation in the State.[74]\r\n\r\nAs Baltimore is the only large city and contains more than half the\r\npopulation of the State it is not surprising that this city has been\r\nthe real battleground of the movement. Twenty-five State conventions\r\nhave been held here, continuing one or two days, and two State\r\nconferences of two days each. The first of the conferences was\r\narranged by Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, the new national president, and\r\nheld in Baltimore in 1900, at which time Miss Susan B. Anthony was the\r\nguest of honor and was presented with a purse of gold for her 80th\r\nbirthday by the Maryland women. The second conference was held in\r\n1902. The speakers at these conferences besides the national officers\r\nwere Helen Morris Lewis of North Carolina, Annie L. Digges of Kansas,\r\nClara Bewick Colby of Washington, D. C., Dr. Cora Smith Eaton of\r\nMinneapolis and Catharine Waugh McCulloch of Chicago. The day sessions\r\nwere devoted to business and discussions, followed by addresses in the\r\nevening. The State convention of 1901 met in the Friends' Meeting\r\nHouse; that of 1902 in Heptasophs Hall, with a bazar and supper; that\r\nof 1903 in the Friends' Meeting House. The local speakers were Dr. O.\r\nEdward Janney, R. Henry Holme, Lizzie York Case, Annie Davenport, Emma\r\nMaddox Funck and Mary Bentley Thomas. Out of town speakers were Mrs.\r\nCatt, Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, national vice-president at large; Harriet\r\nMay Mills of New York and Emma M. Gillett, a lawyer of Washington, D.\r\nC. The convention of 1904 met in the Church of the Disciples. A supper\r\nwas served between sessions and Dr. Shaw and the Rev. Peter Ainslie\r\nspoke to crowded houses at night.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1905 was held in the Harlem Avenue Christian Church.\r\nMemorial services were held for George W. Catt, husband of the\r\nnational president. The following departments of work were adopted:\r\nPeace and Arbitration, Church, Enrollment, Finance, Legislation and\r\nPress. Dr. Shaw spoke in the evening on The New Democratic Ideal.\r\nInvitations were given in 1904 and 1905 to the National American\r\nSuffrage Association to hold its annual convention in Baltimore. The\r\nsecond was accepted and the convention took place Feb. 7-13, 1906.\r\nHalf of the $1,200 raised for it was given to the National\r\nAssociation. Most of the delegates were entertained in homes. The\r\nmeetings were held in the Lyric Theater and the audiences at the\r\nevening sessions numbered from 1,500 to 3,000. The State association\r\nsent out 20,000 invitations. Music was provided for every session by\r\nthe Charles M. Stieff Piano Company and clergymen came from various\r\nchurches for the opening devotional services. Three men gave unlimited\r\ntime and assistance to the work of the convention, Dr. J. William\r\nFunck, Dr. Janney and Charles H. Holton. As this was the native city\r\nof Miss Mary Garrett and Dr. M. Carey Thomas they united as hostesses\r\nof the association during the convention and thereafter became\r\nimportant factors in the national work.[75] This was the last\r\nconvention attended by Miss Anthony, who died a month later. A\r\nmemorial service was held in Baltimore, the following taking part: the\r\nRev. Alexander Kent of Washington, Mary Badders Holton, Mrs. Funck,\r\nMrs. Janney, Mrs. Holme and Miss Maddox. Music was furnished by the\r\nCecilian quartette of women's voices.\r\n\r\nThe State convention of 1906 was held in the Friends' Meeting House,\r\naddressed by Ellen Spencer Mussey of Washington. In 1907 the\r\nconvention met in Arundell Hall November 21 and in the Hampden\r\nMethodist Church the 22nd. The afternoon program included interesting\r\ntalks by six Baltimore men--Henry White, Dr. Funck, Dr. Janney, R.\r\nHenry Holme, State Forester Albert M. Beasley and the Rev. B. A.\r\nAbbott, pastor of the Harlem Avenue Christian Church. A large number\r\nof fraternal delegates were present. The Rev. Ida C. Hultin of Boston\r\nspoke at both evening sessions.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 the annual meeting was held in McCoy Hall, Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity, with Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Maud Nathan of New York\r\nand Rachel Foster Avery of Philadelphia as speakers. Dr. Lewellys F.\r\nBarker presided at the evening meeting. In 1909 the convention took\r\nplace in the Baltimore Business College, Nov. 23, 24, with Dr. Barton\r\nO. Aylesworth of Colorado and the Rev. John Roach Straton of the\r\nSeventh Baptist Church as the orators at the evening sessions.\r\nMemorial services were held for Henry B. Blackwell. A supper and bazar\r\nwere pleasant features. In 1910 the convention was held in Osler Hall,\r\nCathedral Street, with both sessions devoted to business. A noteworthy\r\nevent of the year was the election of Miss Sarah Richmond, a pioneer\r\nsuffragist, as president of the State Teachers' Association, the first\r\nwoman to be accorded this honor in the fifty years of its existence.\r\nPrizes of $25 were offered for essays on woman suffrage by girls in\r\nthe high school.\r\n\r\nAt the convention of 1911 in Heptasophs Hall the California victory of\r\nOctober 11 was celebrated with a banquet attended by 400 men and\r\nwomen, Mrs. Belva A. Lockwood of Washington presiding. The meeting on\r\nthe next evening was addressed by Miss A. Maud Royden of London on The\r\nEconomic, Spiritual and Religious Aspect of Woman Suffrage. During the\r\nyear a leaflet had been issued entitled Opinions of Representative Men\r\nof Maryland on Woman Suffrage, through Miss Mary B. Dixon, chairman of\r\npublicity, and 600 suffrage posters were placed in the counties. In\r\nBaltimore they were made into double faced placards and men were\r\nemployed to carry them through the business sections. Suffrage\r\npetitions and resolutions had been endorsed by the State Federation of\r\nLabor, Woman's Christian Temperance Union, Ladies of the Maccabees,\r\nGrange and Jewish Council of Women.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1912 was held in the Baltimore Business College, the\r\nafternoon devoted to discussions of plans of work, reports, etc.,\r\nfollowed by a supper and bazar. A report was given of the organization\r\nof a Men's League for Woman Suffrage by Dr. Donald R. Hooker, Dr.\r\nFunck, Dr. Janney, the Rev. James Gratten Mythen, Dr. Warren Lewis,\r\nJacob M. Moses, S. Johnson Poe, Frank F. Ramey and William F. Cochran.\r\nIn the evening there was a debate on the enfranchisement of women by\r\nthe boys of the Polytechnic Institute, Samuel M. North, a member of\r\nthe faculty and a pioneer suffragist, presiding. At the convention of\r\n1913 the twenty-fourth anniversary of the State association was\r\ncelebrated in Veteran Corps Hall with a supper, dance and addresses by\r\nLaura Clay of Kentucky, Clara Bewick Colby of Washington, Ella S.\r\nStewart of Illinois and Lucy Burns of New York. The convention of 1914\r\nwas held in the Royal Arcanum Building. The speakers were Mrs. Robert\r\nLaFollette of Wisconsin, Mrs. Nathan of New York, Mrs. Louis F. Post\r\nof Illinois and Mr. Western Star. It was reported that at the great\r\nsuffrage parade held the preceding March in Washington Maryland had\r\nthe largest delegation.\r\n\r\nThe business session of 1915 was held in the W. C. T. U. Building and\r\nthe evening session in the Universalist Church, whose pastor, the Rev.\r\nC. Clifton Clark, spoke on the pro-suffrage side. This year a union of\r\nall the organizations in the State was effected under the name of the\r\nWoman Suffrage Party of Maryland. Mrs. Funck was elected president and\r\nserved two years.\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting of 1916 was held on the lawn at the home of\r\nElizabeth Bruce Gwynn; that of 1917 on the grounds of the Young\r\nWoman's Christian Association; in 1918 at Tolchester Beach and in 1919\r\nat the home of Evelyn Albaugh Timanus. The workers during these years\r\nalways were volunteers, who served without financial compensation. The\r\nassociation is indebted for the past ten years to Mary Elizabeth Ward\r\nfor all stenographic work and to Margaret A. Maddox for most of the\r\npublicity work.\r\n\r\nAmong those who have represented their counties in State conventions\r\nare the following: Montgomery county, Mary Bentley Thomas, Sarah\r\nMiller, Rebecca Miller, Mary E. Moore, Mary Magruder; Baltimore\r\ncounty, Elizabeth Herring, Josephine E. Smith, Julia F. Abbott, Anna\r\nS. Abbott, Ella Warfield, Kate Vanhorn, Mrs. Charles Weed, Mrs. James\r\nGreen, Mary C. Raspe, Ethel C. Crosby; Harford, Annie H. Hoskins,\r\nLydia Reckord, Eliza Edell; Carroll, Maggie Mehring; Cecil, Alice\r\nCoale Simpers; Somerset, Florence Hoge; Caroline, Miss Eliza\r\nMessenger; Anne Arundel, Mrs. Wilhelmina Nichols; Howard, Miss\r\nElizabeth B. Wilson.\r\n\r\nBALTIMORE CITY CLUB. For more than twenty years this club averaged\r\nfrom four to twenty public meetings annually in theaters, churches and\r\nsuffrage headquarters. Scores of business and executive meetings were\r\nheld and sociables, suppers, lawn fetes, banquets, excursions and\r\nbazars were given. The club opened the first headquarters in 1902 at\r\n107 West Franklin Street, one of the city's noted thoroughfares. In\r\n1908 they were established on North Gilmore Street, West Baltimore,\r\nand in 1912 on the corner of Baltimore and Carey Streets. At both\r\nlocalities the plate glass windows were decorated with pictures of\r\nsuffrage leaders, cartoons, platforms of political parties and\r\nliterature; afternoon tea was served and public meetings held at\r\nnight. It also inaugurated Sunday afternoon meetings which became very\r\npopular and it was responsible for bringing to Baltimore many men and\r\nwomen of national and international distinction. The first English\r\n\"militant\" to speak in Baltimore was Mrs. Annie Cobden Sanderson, on\r\nMy Experience in an English Jail, in January, 1908, in the Christian\r\nTemple, the Rev. Peter Ainslie, the pastor, introducing the speaker,\r\nwho made a profound impression. Mrs. Emmeline Pankhurst came next,\r\nspeaking in Osler Hall on Ideal Democracy, followed by Sylvia\r\nPankhurst and Mrs. Philip Snowden, the latter speaking at the Seventh\r\nBaptist Church, the pastor presiding.\r\n\r\nIn 1909 at a mass meeting one Sunday afternoon in the Lyric Theater\r\nan audience of over 2,000 was present, more than half of them men,\r\nwith Dr. Shaw and Mrs. Florence Kelley the speakers; Judge Jacob M.\r\nMoses of the Juvenile Court presided and a number of men of\r\ndistinction were seated on the platform. Mrs. Catt spoke at a mass\r\nmeeting in the Academy of Music in March, 1913, at which Miss Eliza H.\r\nLord of Washington, D. C., presided and Senator William E. Borah of\r\nIdaho was a guest. Other Sunday afternoon meetings were held in\r\nFord's, Albaugh's, the Garden and the New Theaters with well known\r\nspeakers. Baltimore clergymen assisting at these meetings, besides\r\nthose already mentioned, were the Rev. Dr. Frank M. Ellis and the Rev.\r\nDr. J. W. Wills; the Reverends Kingman Handy, Henry Wharton and W. H.\r\nBaylor of the Baptist Church; George Scholl and Thomas Beadenkoph of\r\nthe Lutheran Synod; Richard W. Hogue and George W. Dame of the\r\nEpiscopal, E. L. Hubbard of the Methodist and Wynne Jones of the\r\nHighlandtown Presbyterian Churches.\r\n\r\nThrough the State Woman Suffrage Association and the Baltimore City\r\nClub much educational work was done from 1900 to 1910 in the way of\r\npublic and parlor meetings. The pictures of suffrage leaders were\r\nplaced in the public schools. The History of Woman Suffrage and the\r\nLife of Susan B. Anthony were given to public libraries. Boys and\r\ngirls were trained for suffrage debates and prizes given for essays.\r\nSubscriptions were solicited for _Progress_ and the _Woman's Journal_;\r\npress work was pushed; opportunities were sought to speak before all\r\nkinds of organizations and there was a wide distribution of suffrage\r\nliterature. Handsomely engrossed resolutions were presented in 1902 to\r\nSenator Jacob M. Moses in appreciation of his having introduced the\r\nbill in the Legislature to permit women to practice law in Maryland;\r\nand to Miss Maddox, the first to be admitted to the bar, a gold pin\r\nbearing the State coat-of-arms as an expression of esteem for her\r\nonerous work in securing its passage.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 and thereafter by specially appointed committees suffrage\r\nplanks were requested in the platforms of the political parties but\r\nwith no success. In 1907 a delegation appeared before the State\r\nFederation of Labor asking for its endorsement of woman suffrage,\r\nwhich was refused.\r\n\r\nFor 1908 the slogan was, Convert the public school teachers. To this\r\nend a mass meeting was held in Baltimore with Miss Grace C. Strachan,\r\na district superintendent of the public schools of New York; the Rev.\r\nOlympia Brown of Wisconsin and Mrs. Emma Smith Devoe of the State of\r\nWashington as speakers. Mrs. Funck attended tri-county conventions of\r\nteachers, speaking on woman suffrage and distributing 5,000 leaflets.\r\nThree women attended the hearing before the House Judiciary Committee\r\nof Congress in the interest of the Federal Amendment, Mrs. Funck\r\naddressing the committee. Independence Day was observed by a parade\r\nand street speaking by Mrs. Colby, Mrs. Timanus and others.\r\n\r\nIn 1911 the first debate on woman suffrage took place before the Men's\r\nClub of the Harlem Park Methodist Church, Mrs. Funck taking the\r\naffirmative side against two members of the Anti-Suffrage Society,\r\nMrs. Francis T. Redwood and Mrs. Haslup Adams. The following year\r\nanother debate was held at the State Normal School by the pupils. In\r\nboth instances the affirmative won.\r\n\r\nIn 1914 a large suffrage bazar was held under the auspices of all the\r\nclubs in the Fifth Regiment Armory with good financial results. This\r\nyear the association entered the political arena, the logical\r\nculmination of previous years of work. Legislation and Publicity was\r\nthe slogan. It specialized in ward work, besieged legislative and\r\npolitical leaders with telegrams and letters, visited their offices\r\nand homes, watched at the polls, worked to defeat anti-suffrage\r\ncandidates; addressed shop and factory employees, spoke on street\r\ncorners and at county fairs, made use of suffrage posters and unique\r\nadvertisements and had parades.\r\n\r\nThe State Woman Suffrage Association has had but two presidents, Mary\r\nBentley Thomas of Ednor, 1894-1904 and Emma Maddox Funck, 1904-1920.\r\nThe latter was president of the Baltimore City Society 1897-1920.\r\nOthers who served as State officers ten years and more were Mary\r\nBadders Holton, Evelyn Albaugh Timanus, Etta H. Maddox, Anne Webb\r\n(Mrs. O. Edward) Janney, Pauline W. Holme, Mary Young Taylor, Edna\r\nAnnette Beveridge, Nellie C. Cromwell, Florence E. Barnes, Mary E.\r\nMoore, Margaret Smythe Clark and Annie H. Hoskins. Space will not\r\npermit the names of the many women who were loyal and helpful during\r\nthese years. Women were not left entirely alone to fight the battle\r\nand many men besides those mentioned assisted and encouraged.\r\n\r\nThe Maryland Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage was organized in\r\nBaltimore in 1911, opening its first headquarters in North Charles\r\nStreet with Mrs. N. C. Talbott as executive secretary. Later there was\r\nsome organization in the counties. The members through public\r\nmeetings, legislative hearings and distribution of literature\r\nvigorously carried on their opposition to women's enfranchisement. The\r\nsociety was affiliated with the National Anti-Suffrage Association and\r\nwas organized for the purpose of fighting the movement to enfranchise\r\nwomen by both Federal and State amendments. The presidents were Mrs.\r\nJohn Redwood, Mrs. Oscar Leser, Mrs. Rufus Gibbs and Mrs. Robert\r\nGarrett, the last named serving until after the Federal Amendment was\r\nadopted. Other women active in opposition were Mrs. Michael Wild, Mrs.\r\nRosalie Strauss, Mrs. W. P. E. Wyse, Mrs. P. Lea Thom, Mrs. Coyle\r\nHaslup Adams, Mrs. George A. Frick and Mrs. William L. Marbury. This\r\nassociation gave substantial aid in money and other ways to the\r\nMaryland legislators who went to Virginia, North Carolina and\r\nTennessee to work against the ratification of the Federal Amendment by\r\ntheir Legislatures.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. The Maryland Woman Suffrage Association in\r\nconnection with its suffrage activities worked in the Legislature for\r\nother progressive measures, among them the use of the public schools\r\nfor social centers; equal pay for equal service; appointment of women\r\non boards of education and on all public institutions; the abolition\r\nof capital punishment; initiative and referendum; co-education;\r\nabolition of child labor.\r\n\r\n1906. Legislators declined to introduce any suffrage measure and\r\ntreated the request as a joke.\r\n\r\n1907. A special committee appointed by the Legislature to revise the\r\nelection laws was asked that the word \"male\" be stricken out. No\r\nattention was paid to the request.\r\n\r\n1910. The resolution for submitting an amendment was framed by Etta H.\r\nMaddox, introduced by Delegate William Harry Paire, the Republican\r\nfloor leader, and referred to the Committee on Constitutional\r\nAmendments. The hearing was held in the House of Delegates at\r\nAnnapolis on February 24 before the committee and an audience that\r\ntaxed the chamber's capacity. Miss Maddox presided and introduced the\r\nspeakers--Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, president of the National Suffrage\r\nAssociation; the Rev. John Roach Straton, the Rev. Peter Ainslie,\r\nAttorney John Grill, Dr. Flora Pollack, Mrs. Mary Badders Holton, Mrs.\r\nFunck, the Rev. Olympia Brown of Wisconsin, Dr. J. William Funck and\r\nMiss Belle Kearney of Mississippi. An evening meeting also was held in\r\nthe same place in the interest of the amendment. On March 24 Carville\r\nD. Benson of Baltimore county moved to lay it on the table which was\r\ndone by a vote of 61 ayes, 18 noes. No action was taken by the Senate.\r\n\r\n1912. All the suffrage societies united in asking for the submission\r\nof a State amendment for full suffrage. Their best speakers appeared\r\nbefore the committees. A petition was presented to both Houses, signed\r\nby 30,000 voters, but it polled only 22 affirmative votes in the\r\nHouse. Soon after a limited suffrage bill, sponsored by the Equal\r\nSuffrage League, failed by a vote of 16 noes, 9 ayes in the Senate.\r\n\r\n1914. The amendment resolution was introduced in the House by Charles\r\nH. McNab of Harford county and in the Senate by William Holmead of\r\nPrince George county. It was supported by all the suffrage societies,\r\nand ably advocated but lost by 34 ayes, 60 noes in the House and\r\ndefeated in the Senate. A resolution introduced in the Senate asking\r\nfor the full suffrage for women with an educational and property\r\nqualification, endorsed only by the Equal Suffrage League, failed to\r\nget a hearing. One in the Senate requiring a literacy test only was\r\nnot reported.\r\n\r\n1916. The constitutional amendment for full suffrage was introduced in\r\nthe House by Lloyd Wilkinson (Democrat) of Baltimore and in the Senate\r\nby Sydney Mudd (Republican) of Charles county and strongly supported.\r\nHouse vote was 36 ayes, 64 noes. The Senate committee reported\r\nfavorably and the vote stood 17 ayes, 7 noes, William F. Chesley the\r\nonly Republican who voted no. The lobbyists were Mrs. Hooker, Mrs.\r\nDora Ogle, Mrs. Robert Moss, Miss Lucy Branham, Miss Maddox, Miss\r\nGwendolyn Willis, the Rev. Olympia Brown, Mrs. Charles E. Ellicott,\r\nMrs. Ross Thompson, Miss Emma Weber, Mrs. William H. Maloy, Mrs.\r\nCalvin Gabriel, Mrs. Timanus, Mrs. Howard Schwartz, Mrs. Funck. This\r\nwas the last time a State amendment was asked for.\r\n\r\n1917. At the special session a bill for Presidential suffrage,\r\nsupported by the State association and the Just Government League,\r\npassed the Senate by a vote of 18 ayes, 6 noes, after a joint hearing\r\nheld in the State House, where the outside speakers, were Dudley Field\r\nMalone, U. S. Senator Shafroth and Representative Jeannette Rankin. In\r\nthe House it failed by a vote of 41 ayes, 56 noes.\r\n\r\n1918. The Presidential suffrage bill received in the House 42 ayes, 53\r\nnoes; in the Senate 12 ayes, 13 noes.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. For twenty-five years the women of Maryland tried to get\r\nsome form of suffrage from their Legislature without success and it is\r\nnot surprising that they felt obliged to look to a Federal Amendment\r\nfor their enfranchisement. The delegation in Congress was divided on\r\nits submission, Senator Joseph I. France (Republican) voting in favor\r\nand Senator John Walter Smith (Democrat) in opposition; two\r\nRepresentatives in favor and five in opposition. After it had been\r\nsent to the Legislatures for ratification in June, 1919, pressure was\r\nbrought to bear on Governor Emerson C. Harrington to call a special\r\nsession, as it was reported that a majority in favor might be secured.\r\nU. S. Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer urged it in a letter July\r\n10, saying: \"Pennsylvania has already ratified and it will be a\r\nservice to our party if a Democratic State like Maryland will promptly\r\nfollow suit.\" The Governor advised waiting till the regular session as\r\n\"this Legislature was not elected with the question of this amendment\r\nbefore the people.\"\r\n\r\nThe regular session convened Jan 7, 1920, and Albert Cabell Ritchie\r\nhad been elected Governor. Mrs. William Milnes Maloy was chairman of\r\nthe Suffrage Campaign Committee and Mrs. Robert Moss of the\r\nlegislative work in Annapolis, and the committee was composed of\r\nprominent suffragists from all the societies. A mass meeting took\r\nplace on January 20 in the State Armory at Annapolis, with addresses\r\nby U. S. Senator Kenneth McKellar of Tennessee, State Senator Oliver\r\nMetzerott and Mrs. Donald R. Hooker. State Senator George Q. Bartlett\r\nread letters from Senator France advocating ratification. Many members\r\nof the Legislature were seated on the platform. At the close of the\r\nmeeting Mrs. Maloy offered a resolution in favor of ratification,\r\nwhich was carried by a large majority.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, February 6, Governor Ritchie submitted the Federal Woman\r\nSuffrage Amendment to the General Assembly. Senator Metzerott\r\n(Republican) introduced a resolution for ratification in the Senate\r\nand Representative Cobourn (Democrat) in the House. It was sent to the\r\nSenate Committee on Federal Relations, Senator Grason, chairman; to\r\nthe House Committee on Constitutional Amendments, Mr. Roberts\r\nchairman. A hearing was set for February 11 but on being informed that\r\nmost of the suffrage leaders would be in Chicago attending the\r\nnational suffrage convention at that time and that others of their\r\nspeakers could not be present, Senator Grason said that, with Mr.\r\nRobert's consent, the hearing would be postponed until the 18th.\r\n\r\nThe suffragists heard no more and great was the surprise of those of\r\nthe committee who were left to find on returning to Annapolis February\r\n10, when the session reconvened, that Mr. Roberts absolutely refused\r\nto delay and the hearing would take place on February 11. A hasty\r\ncanvass of his committee showed that a majority was in favor of\r\ndeferring it until the 18th, so the suffragists returned to their\r\nhomes. The next morning the Baltimore papers announced that it would\r\nbe held that day. The suffragists learned that the preceding night\r\nSpeaker Tydings had transferred the suffrage amendment from the\r\nCommittee on Constitutional Amendments, which was favorable to it, and\r\nhad put it into the Committee on Federal Relations, which was hostile!\r\nThere were of course no members of the suffrage committee present at\r\nthe hearing. Mrs. Rufus Gibbs, president of the State Anti-Suffrage\r\nAssociation, urged the defeat of ratification. William F. Marbury made\r\na strong argument against it. Senator Legg of Queen Anne's, who had\r\nannounced that he \"would do just what Governor Ritchie desired,\" spoke\r\nagainst it. Delegates Cobourn, Shartzer, Curry and the minority floor\r\nleader, Vernon Simmons, explained how the suffragists had been\r\ndeceived and made an earnest plea for fair play.\r\n\r\nIt had been intended to bring the measure to a vote immediately but\r\nthe feeling against this was so intense that it was finally set for\r\nthe 17th. The suffragists demanded a hearing but the House committee\r\nrefused it and made an adverse report on the resolution to ratify. The\r\nSenate committee granted one for the morning of the 17th. Long before\r\nthe hour set suffragists from many places began to gather. At 10:30\r\nthe larger delegations arrived, heralded by Farson's band, and marched\r\nstraight into the State House. Their number was so large that Chairman\r\nGrason adjourned from the committee room to the Senate Chamber. Mrs.\r\nHooker presented resolutions and petitions for ratification from\r\norganizations representing over 125,000 residents of Maryland. They\r\nwere from many State labor associations, patriotic societies, the\r\nGrange, Federation of Women's Clubs, Women's Trade Union League,\r\nTeachers' Association, Graduate Nurses, Goucher College Alumnae, clubs\r\nfor every conceivable purpose. She was followed by Mrs. Edward\r\nShoemaker, chairman of the women's State branch of the National\r\nCouncil of Defense, who made an eloquent appeal for the proposed\r\namendment. Judge J. Harry Covington, member of Congress, gave a strong\r\nlegal and political argument, answering that of Mr. Marbury. Mrs.\r\nHenry Zollinger represented the Women's Anti-Suffrage Association and\r\nJudge Oscar Leser spoke in opposition. The Hon. Thomas Parran summed\r\nup for the suffragists.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o'clock the suffragists went to the reception room of the\r\nGovernor, who announced that he wished to give them all the time that\r\nthey desired to present their case. The speakers were Mrs. Sydney M.\r\nCone, Mrs. Shoemaker, Miss Kate McLane, prominent in war work; Mrs.\r\nRobert Moss, Guion Miller representing the Society of Friends; Mrs.\r\nRobert H. Walker, the college women; Miss Hunt, the nurses; Miss Mary\r\nDubrau, the eastern shore. The Governor, answering, said that the\r\nratification was a question for the Legislature alone to determine;\r\nthat the platform on which he ran pledged the Democratic party\r\nagainst it and that he could not ask the legislators to repudiate the\r\nplatform. Mrs. Hooker in vigorous language held him wholly responsible\r\nfor the action they took on it.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon Representatives Cobourn, McBride, Shartzer, Demarco,\r\nJones and Gambrill spoke for ratification. The vote stood 64 noes, 36\r\nayes. The same afternoon Senators Metzerott, Gibson, Bartlett and\r\nRobins earnestly urged ratification; Senators J. Frank Parran,\r\nMcIntosh and Legg spoke against it. The vote stood 18 noes, 9 ayes,\r\nseven Republicans and two Democrats. In the House 32 of the 45\r\nRepublicans and 4 of the 56 Democrats voted in favor.\r\n\r\nUndaunted by their defeat the suffragists gathered in front of the\r\nState House and with colors flying and band playing martial airs\r\nmarched two by two around the Capitol, receiving many cheers and good\r\nwishes from the spectators. A brief meeting was then held at which\r\nresolutions of appreciation were passed for all the brave men who had\r\nfought so valiantly for democracy.\r\n\r\nCommittees of both Houses had reported a resolution of definite\r\nrejection, which the Senate passed, and a delegation of women from the\r\nAnti-Suffrage Association, headed by Mrs. Gibbs, carried it to\r\nWashington and presented it to the Acting Secretary of State, serving\r\nformal notice that \"the State of Maryland denies the lawful right and\r\npower of Congress to propose the amendment for woman suffrage and the\r\nvalidity of such an amendment as part of the Federal Constitution even\r\nif ratified by three-fourths of the States.\"\r\n\r\nThe Maryland Legislature was by no means satisfied with its\r\ndemonstration of State's rights in defeating the ratification of the\r\nFederal Suffrage Amendment but it undertook to interfere with the\r\nrights of other States. On February 24 the House of Delegates voted by\r\n54 to 44 for a joint resolution to send a delegation of seven\r\nanti-suffrage members to West Virginia to urge its General Assembly to\r\nfollow the course of Maryland in rejecting the amendment. This was\r\nadopted by the Senate with little delay and three of its members were\r\nappointed to accompany four selected by the House. The next day two\r\nresolutions drawn up by Mr. Marbury were introduced in the\r\nLegislature. One was to \"repeal, rescind and recall the resolutions\r\nratifying the so-called Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of\r\nthe United States.\" The other authorized and requested the Governor to\r\ncall on the national government, in behalf of the State of Maryland,\r\nto \"have the so-called Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act\r\ndeclared null and void.\" The reason for his opposition to woman\r\nsuffrage was clearly apparent.\r\n\r\nOn March 30 by a vote of 20 ayes, 7 noes, the Senate passed a joint\r\nresolution introduced by George Arnold Frick authorizing and directing\r\nthe Attorney General of Maryland to bring suit or suits to prevent the\r\nSecretary of State of the United States from proclaiming the Federal\r\nAmendment prior to the holding of a referendum thereon in certain\r\nStates, and to test the validity, should the same be ratified by the\r\nelected Legislatures of three-fourths of the States. This also passed\r\nin the House. The opponents thought that now they had spiked every gun\r\nbut in September it was discovered that the vote on ratification had\r\nbeen pigeonholed instead of being sent by the Governor to the\r\nSecretary of State in Washington. Immediately there was hustling to\r\nbring it again before the two Houses and on September 22 it was\r\nrejected in the Senate by a vote of 17 to 8 and in the House by 51 to\r\n42, nearly a month after the Federal Amendment had been proclaimed!\r\n\r\nA Men's Anti-Suffrage Association had been formed under the name of\r\nthe Maryland League for State Defense and a suit was brought by its\r\nboard of managers. This was called the case of Leser vs. Garnett,\r\nJudge Leser and his associate lawyers representing this League, Mr.\r\nGarnett representing the Board of Registry of the 7th Precinct of the\r\n11th Ward of Baltimore. On Oct. 12, 1920, Judge Leser challenged the\r\nregistration there of Cecilia S. Waters (white) and Mary D. Randolph\r\n(colored) in order to test the validity of what the \"antis\" called the\r\n\"alleged\" 19th Amendment. The plea was that it exceeded the amending\r\npower of Article V in the Federal Constitution and that it was not\r\nlegally ratified by 36 States. The States arraigned as having\r\nillegally ratified were West Virginia and Missouri. The case came\r\nbefore the court of common pleas, Judge Heuisler presiding. Besides\r\nMr. Marbury the attorneys for the petitioners were Thomas Cadwalader,\r\nSenator Frick and Everett P. Wheeler of New York. The defendants were\r\nrepresented by George M. Brady, Roger Howell, Jacob M. Moses and\r\nAssistant Attorney General Lindsay C. Spencer. The case occupied four\r\nfull days and the petitioners lost. Judge Heuisler ruled that the\r\npower to amend the Constitution of the United States granted by the\r\nFifth Article thereof is without limit except as to the words, \"equal\r\nsuffrage in the Senate.\" He added: \"The court is further of the\r\nopinion from all the exhibits and other evidence submitted that there\r\nwas due, legal and proper ratification of the amendment by the\r\nrequired number of State Legislatures.\" Mr. Wheeler contended that\r\nthree-fourths of the States had not legally ratified, to which the\r\nCourt answered: \"There was one legal and proper ratification of the\r\namendment by the required number of State Legislatures.\"\r\n\r\nThe case was carried up to the State Court of Appeals and argued on\r\nApril 7. On June 28 the Judge affirmed the decision of the lower\r\ncourt. The case was then taken to the U. S. Supreme Court, which gave\r\na decision adverse to all these claims and established the validity of\r\nthe Federal Suffrage Amendment beyond all further controversy.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARYLAND. PART II.[76]\r\n\r\nThe Woman Suffrage League of Maryland was organized Feb. 27, 1917, in\r\nBaltimore at a meeting called with the approval of the National\r\nAmerican Woman Suffrage Association. Mrs. J. Ross Thompson of Garrett\r\nPark was elected president and served for two years. The league\r\nstarted with a sustaining membership of 1,400, including organizations\r\nin Baltimore and thirteen counties. By 1920 the city was organized by\r\ncongressional districts and some of these by wards; twenty of the\r\ntwenty-three counties had organizations, some of them strong branch\r\nleagues, others merely small groups with a chairman.\r\n\r\nThe history of the league must be traced through its mother, the Equal\r\nSuffrage League of Baltimore, back to the Mary A. Livermore League, a\r\nsociety of Friends, which had been founded in 1905 with Mrs. Edward\r\nO. Janney as president. In the spring of 1909 this league, in order to\r\nbroaden its scope, became the Equal Suffrage League of Baltimore. Mrs.\r\nElisabeth King Ellicott was elected president and filled this office\r\nwith wisdom and rare executive ability until her death in May, 1914.\r\nThe league, as a branch of the State Suffrage Association, sent Miss\r\nJulia Rogers as a delegate to the national convention held in Seattle\r\nin 1909. This year a mass meeting was held in McCoy Hall, Johns\r\nHopkins University, Dr. Thayer of the Medical School presiding. Miss\r\nEthel Arnold of England was the speaker and made many converts.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 the league had a bill introduced in the Legislature giving\r\nMunicipal suffrage to \"every bona fide resident of the city of\r\nBaltimore, male or female, 21 years of age.... (a) If such person is\r\nqualified to vote for members of the House of Delegates; or (b) can\r\nread or write from dictation any paragraph of more than five lines in\r\nthe State constitution; or (c) is assessed with property in said city\r\nto the amount of $300 and has paid taxes thereon for at least two\r\nyears preceding the election....\" The league was fortunate in securing\r\nas attorney Judge Jacob M. Moses of the Juvenile Court. He conducted a\r\nhearing on February 16 in the House of Delegates attended by both\r\nbranches of the Legislature. Six hundred women and men went on a\r\nspecial train to Annapolis, carrying a petition for the bill\r\nrepresenting 173,000 names. The speakers were Dr. Howard Kelly of\r\nJohns Hopkins, president of the Men's League; Dr. Mary Sherwood of the\r\nmedical department; Judge Moses, Mrs. Ellicott, Mrs. Ida Husted Harper\r\nof New York, Miss Janet Richards of Washington, Misses Julia Rogers,\r\nMary E. Lent, Ellen La Mott and Sarah Brookes. The House committee\r\nreported eight to one in favor. The advocates in the House were Robert\r\nH. Carr, who introduced the bill, H. Pairo, R. F. Beacham and Mr.\r\nHenderson. It received 67 noes, 24 ayes and did not come before the\r\nSenate. Three other woman suffrage bills were defeated this session.\r\n\r\nIn 1909-1910 Mrs. Donald R. Hooker, chairman of the Lecture Committee,\r\nwas instrumental in securing many noted speakers for public meetings.\r\nIn 1910 she formed the Just Government League of Maryland, which was\r\naffiliated with the National Association for six years. Miss Lent was\r\npresident two years and then Mrs. Hooker continuously.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 a field secretary was engaged by the Equal Suffrage League,\r\nward organization progressed and money was raised through rummage\r\nsales, lawn fetes, suppers at headquarters, etc. In 1911 the _New\r\nVoter_ was started, a lively suffrage paper, with Miss Anne Wagner as\r\neditor-in-chief. A committee was appointed, with Mrs. Charles E.\r\nEllicott chairman, to investigate methods in the Criminal Court of\r\nconducting trials when young girls were witnesses in cases of assault,\r\netc. This committee attended trials and employed a woman to keep\r\nrecords of cases and decisions. Later it had the first woman probation\r\nofficer appointed and paid her salary until 1916, when Mayor Preston\r\nagreed to its payment by the city temporarily.\r\n\r\nThe State Equal Franchise League was founded in 1911 and became\r\nauxiliary to the National American Association. Mrs. Elisabeth King\r\nEllicott was the president for two years and she was succeeded by Mrs.\r\nW. J. Brown, who was president for one year. The affiliated societies\r\nwere the Equal Suffrage League of Baltimore, Woman Suffrage Club of\r\nMontgomery county, Just Franchise League of Talbot county, Junior\r\nSuffrage League of Walbrook, College Suffrage League of Frederick,\r\nEqual Franchise Leagues of Thurmont and Emmitsburg, Junior Suffrage\r\nLeague of Bryn Mawr School and Political Equality League of Baltimore\r\ncounty. It joined in the work of the other associations for various\r\nbills in the Legislature until 1914, when it disbanded, and, the\r\nconstitution of the National Association now permitting the direct\r\naffiliation of any suffrage society numbering 200 members, the Equal\r\nSuffrage League of Baltimore became a direct auxiliary. In May, 1914,\r\nit met with a great loss in the death of Mrs. Ellicott, who had\r\norganized and held it firm for the non-partisan, non-political,\r\neducational principles of the National Association. She left $25,000\r\nin the hands of trustees, the interest to be used by the league until\r\nequal suffrage had been obtained in Maryland. Mrs. Charles E. Ellicott\r\nthen became president and successfully continued the work. The\r\nextensive development of the Children's Playground Association under\r\nher leadership is well known throughout the State.[77]\r\n\r\nThe Woman Suffrage League of Maryland was formed in February, 1917,\r\nand the Baltimore City Committee took the active place of the Equal\r\nSuffrage League, which became a funding body to carry out the bequest\r\nof Mrs. Ellicott, with Miss Caroline Roberts as president, whose\r\nunwearying and ceaseless service had been for years an inspiration to\r\nher fellow workers. Mrs. Nettie Rogers Shuler, chairman of Campaigns\r\nand Surveys for the National Association, went to Baltimore this\r\nmonth, meeting there Miss Emma MacAlarney and Miss Eleanor Furman, two\r\nof the national organizers, and planning a speaking and organization\r\nroute. The organizers remained in Maryland two months and were very\r\nsuccessful in interesting new groups of people all over the State, who\r\njoined the new Woman Suffrage League. Later Miss Alice Hunt, a\r\nnational organizer, took up this work for four weeks. The total cost\r\nto the National Association was over $600.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1917 a Suffrage School was held in Baltimore by the\r\nleague to which all were invited. The National Association sent some\r\nof its best teachers, among them Mrs. Arthur L. Livermore, Mrs. Halsey\r\nW. Wilson and Mrs. Shuler, members of its official board. The climax\r\nof the week was a parade, street speeches and a mass meeting, at which\r\nMrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, national president, was the principal\r\nspeaker. An outcome of the school was the printing in Maryland\r\nnewspapers of the suffrage literature supplied by the National\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nWhen the United States entered the World War Mrs. Ellicott, president\r\nof the league, was appointed by the Governor a State member of the\r\nWoman's Council of National Defense and the league cooperated in all\r\nof the departments of war work created by the National Suffrage\r\nAssociation. A Red Cross Circle was established in its headquarters\r\nand it entered actively into the sale of Liberty Bonds. Its war work\r\nbrought into it many new members.\r\n\r\nIn the work for ratification of the Federal Amendment the League\r\njoined the other suffrage societies in the headquarters at Annapolis\r\nand in public meetings, house to house canvass, interviews with\r\nlegislators and the other work of a vigorous campaign. The officers\r\nwere: Mrs. Ellicott, president; Mrs. Edward Shoemaker, Mrs. William\r\nMilnes Maloy and Mrs. Sidney Cone, vice-presidents; Miss Julia Rogers\r\nand Mrs. Robert Moss, corresponding and recording secretaries; Mrs.\r\nFrank Ramey, treasurer; Mrs. George Crawford and Mrs. William Silver,\r\nauditors.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Equal Suffrage League of Baltimore were Miss\r\nCaroline Roberts, president; Miss Clara T. Waite, vice-president; Mrs.\r\nWilliam Chatard, secretary; Miss Mary Claire O'Brien, treasurer: with\r\neight directors.[78]\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. This has been described. A Ratification Committee\r\nof Men was formed in 1919 with N. Winslow Williams chairman, De Courcy\r\nW. Thom vice-chairman, Arthur K. Taylor secretary, Donald R. Hooker,\r\ntreasurer. Prominent members of the Allied Building Trades Council,\r\nCarpenters' Union and other labor organizations were on the committee\r\nand every county had a chairman. In Allegany it was Francis J. Drum,\r\npresident of the Maryland and D. C. Federation of Labor; in Baltimore\r\ncounty B. John Black, master of the State Grange. In other counties it\r\nwas a member of Congress or the Legislature or a Judge or some one of\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[73] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Emma Maddox\r\nFunck, president of the Baltimore Suffrage Club twenty-five years and\r\nof the State Woman Suffrage Association eighteen years.\r\n\r\n[74] Dr. William Tindall, of Washington, has the records to prove that\r\nin 1838, when the people of Georgetown voted on a proposal to withdraw\r\nfrom the State of Maryland, 63 women cast their ballots. As early as\r\n1867, through the efforts of Lavinia C. Dundore, a large equal rights\r\nsociety of men and women was organized in Baltimore, which continued\r\nuntil 1874 and was represented in the national conventions by its\r\npresident, Mrs. Dundore. A Baltimore paper of April 4, 1870, says: \"A\r\npetition, asking for the right of suffrage and political justice, was\r\npresented to the House of Delegates, signed by Eliza S. White, Lavinia\r\nC. Dundore, Ellen M. Harris and 150 other ladies. It was referred to\r\nthe Committee on Federal Relations.\"\r\n\r\n[75] For full account of the convention see Chapter VI, Volume V.\r\n\r\n[76] The History is indebted for this chapter to Miss Clara Turnbull\r\nWaite, vice-president of the Equal Suffrage League of Baltimore.\r\n\r\n[77] Additional names of women who held office or were prominent in\r\nwork of the Equal Suffrage League of Baltimore or the State Equal\r\nFranchise League of Maryland are Drs. Fannie Hoopes, Lillian Welsh,\r\nMary Sherwood, Florence Sabin, Claribel Cone, Nellie Mark; Mesdames\r\nPauline Holme, George Lamb, S. Johnson Poe, J. Williams Lord, Frank\r\nRamey, C. C. Heath, George H. Wright, J. H. Webb-Peploe, Jacob M.\r\nMoses, Mary N. Parry and W. W. Emmart; Misses Mary Bartlett Dixon,\r\nElisabeth Gilman, A. Page Reid, Henrietta Norris, Romaine McIlvaine\r\nand Emma Weber.\r\n\r\n[78] Among these directors, active members of the city committee,\r\nchairmen of standing committees and devoted workers not elsewhere\r\nmentioned were Mesdames Edwin Rouse, Jr., chairman of the city\r\ncommittee; Caleb Athey, Harvey Bickel, C. C. Peffer, J. W. Putts, John\r\nParker, A. Morris Carey, C. C. Heath; Esther Moses and Esther Katz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS.[79]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the present century the Massachusetts Woman\r\nSuffrage Association, organized in 1870, steadily gained in membership\r\nyear after year. Its annual conventions for many years were held in\r\nBoston in January and those of the New England Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation in May, when the two united in a great Festival, which\r\ngenerally took place in Faneuil Hall. The day sessions usually were\r\nheld in the rooms of the New England Women's Club, the evening\r\nsessions in some large place, in 1901 at Faneuil Hall.\r\n\r\nAt the State annual meeting Jan. 23, 1901, Mrs. Mary A. Livermore, who\r\nhad been president since 1893, presided and among the speakers were\r\nMrs. Helen Campbell, the Rev. Charles W. Wendte, Dr. Emily B. Ryder\r\nand the Rev. Ida C. Hultin. Mrs. Livermore was re-elected and Mrs.\r\nMaud Wood Park succeeded Miss Alice Stone Blackwell as chairman of the\r\nState Board of Directors. The office of president had always been\r\nmainly honorary and the actual work was done by the chairman of this\r\nboard. The other officers chosen were Henry B. Blackwell,\r\ncorresponding secretary; William Lloyd Garrison, treasurer; Miss Eva\r\nChanning, clerk; Miss Amanda M. Lougee, Richard P. Hallowell,\r\nauditors; Mrs. Judith W. Smith, member National Executive Committee.\r\nThere was a long list of distinguished vice-presidents. Mr. Blackwell\r\nhad been secretary for over twenty years and was re-elected.\r\n\r\nAt the Festival on May 22, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe presided, Miss Sarah\r\nCone Bryant was toastmistress and there were addresses by William M.\r\nSalter, the Hon. William Dudley Foulke and others of note. On May 23\r\nat the annual meeting of the New England Association, organized in\r\nNovember, 1868, reports were made from the New England States, and\r\naddresses by the Rev. Florence Kollock Crooker, Mrs. Isabel C.\r\nBarrows, Mrs. Inez Haynes Gillmore and others. Mrs. Howe, who had been\r\nits president since 1893, was re-elected, with a board composed of\r\neminent men and women.\r\n\r\nDuring the year the State association sent out 1,246 press articles,\r\ncirculated many thousand pages of literature and printed several\r\nleaflets. It held well-attended fortnightly meetings at its\r\nheadquarters, No. 3 Park Street, and gave a brilliant reception in\r\nhonor of Mrs. Livermore's 80th birthday. It compiled a list of about\r\nforty persons ready to give addresses on suffrage and sent a speaker\r\nfree to every woman's club or other organization willing to hear the\r\nsubject presented. It held ten public meetings and sent out 11,000\r\ncirculars to increase the women's registration and school vote in\r\nBoston. Many addresses under its auspices were given by Mrs. Abby\r\nMorton Diaz, Professor Anna May Soule of Mt. Holyoke and Señorita\r\nCarolina Holman Huidobro of Chile. Massachusetts contributed\r\nfour-fifths of the money given to the Oregon campaign of 1900 from\r\noutside that State, and the Massachusetts booth (named the Lucy Stone\r\nbooth) at the National Suffrage Bazar that year took in more money\r\nthan that of any other State except New York. The College Equal\r\nSuffrage League's prize of $100, for the best essay in favor of\r\nsuffrage by a college student, was won by Ava M. Stoddard of the\r\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology. The above is a sample of the\r\nactivities carried on year after year by the association during the\r\nfirst decade of the century.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 the Boston Equal Suffrage Association for Good Government was\r\norganized through the efforts of Mrs. Mary Hutcheson Page, with\r\nPauline Agassiz (Mrs. Quincy A.) Shaw as president, Mrs. Fanny B.\r\nAmes, chairman of Executive Committee, and Mrs. Park as executive\r\nsecretary.[80] It continued to be a power in the State till suffrage\r\nwas won and aimed to devote itself not only to suffrage but to all\r\nactivities in which women could be especially useful to the community.\r\n\r\nThe National Woman Suffrage Association of Massachusetts, a smaller\r\norganization, disbanded in 1901 after nearly twenty years of\r\nexistence. Mrs. Sarah A. P. Dickerman was acting president, Miss\r\nLavina A. Hatch secretary. It had held eleven monthly meetings during\r\nthe past year, done congressional work and contributed to the Susan B.\r\nAnthony table at the national bazar in New York.\r\n\r\n1902. At the annual meeting on January 23, Mrs. Park presided and a\r\nwork conference was substituted for the usual public meeting. The\r\nFestival was held on May 28 with the Rev. Anna Garlin Spencer\r\npresiding. Other speakers were the Rev. Dr. James H. Ecob, Professor\r\nJohn Graham Brooks, the Rev. Ida C. Hultin, Colonel T. W. Higginson\r\nand the Rev. Charles F. Dole. Miss Vida Goldstein of Australia\r\naddressed a number of meetings this year. An enrollment of suffragists\r\nwas begun. There was an increase of women's registration for the\r\nschool vote in fourteen cities, in Boston of about 5,000. An\r\ninvestigation of the tax records by Mr. Blackwell showed that in\r\nBoston alone 18,500 women paid taxes on several hundred million\r\ndollars' worth of property.\r\n\r\n1903. At the annual meeting of the State association on January 13,\r\nMrs. Shaw and Mrs. Park presided. Mrs. Livermore was made honorary\r\npresident and Mrs. Lucia Ames Mead president, Mrs. Mary Schlesinger,\r\nvice-president; Miss Harriet E. Turner, corresponding secretary;\r\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison, treasurer; Mrs. Otto B. Cole, clerk; Mr.\r\nBlackwell, member of the National Executive Committee. Mrs. Page,\r\nchairman of the Organization Committee, reported that forty towns had\r\nbeen visited. There were speeches by Mrs. Livermore and Mrs. Enid\r\nStacy Widdrington of England. Miss Blackwell presided at the New\r\nEngland annual meeting May 27 and the Rev. Charles G. Ames at the\r\nFestival the next day. On August 13 Lucy Stone's birthday anniversary\r\nwas celebrated by a pilgrimage to the old farm house near West\r\nBrookfield where she was born. About 400 persons gathered from various\r\nStates, even California being represented. Her niece, Mrs. Phebe Stone\r\nBeeman, president of the Warren Political Equality Club, presided and\r\nthere were addresses by Mrs. Livermore, Mr. Blackwell, the Rev. Mary\r\nA. Safford and others. The beautiful weather and the beautiful scenery\r\ncombined with the beautiful memories to make it a memorable occasion.\r\nMrs. Livermore wrote afterwards: \"It was greater and grander than any\r\npublic day, not specially devoted to religion, that I have ever known.\r\nThe hill was a Mount of Transfiguration, the faces of the people\r\nshone.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Anna Howard Shaw addressed a series of meetings throughout\r\nthe State. Mrs. Page, Mrs. Park, Mrs. Diaz, Mrs. Esther F. Boland,\r\nMiss Bryant and George H. Page spoke repeatedly for the association.\r\nWork conferences were held in various counties and equal rights plays\r\nby Mr. Page were performed for the benefit of the cause. The State\r\nheadquarters were moved from Park Street to a house at No. 6 Marlboro\r\nStreet, the use of which was given by Mrs. Quincy A. Shaw.\r\nMassachusetts this year contributed more money to the National\r\nAssociation than did any other State. The time of the State annual\r\nmeeting was changed to October and it began to be held outside of\r\nBoston, a second one for this year in the Newtons, October 29 and 30.\r\nIt opened with a reception by the Newton League at the Hunnewell Club\r\nHouse, where Mrs. Electa N. L. Walton presided and Mayor Weeks of\r\nNewton and the Hon. Samuel L. Powers gave addresses of welcome. The\r\nfollowing day at West Newton Mrs. Livermore presided, the Hon. Gorman\r\nD. Gilman gave the address of welcome and Mrs. Florence Kelley and Dr.\r\nShaw spoke. The Enrollment Committee reported obtaining 11,169\r\nsignatures. A resolution of tribute was passed to Miss Harriet E.\r\nTurner, who retired after 21 years' devoted service at headquarters,\r\nwhere she had suggested some of the most successful lines of work.\r\nMrs. Page was chosen as chairman of the State board, Mrs. Susan S.\r\nFessenden succeeding her later in the year.\r\n\r\n1904. The Festival was held on May 10, Mrs. Howe presiding. The\r\nspeakers were Judge Edward E. Reynolds of Portland, Maine, the Rev.\r\nFlorence Kollock Crooker of Michigan, Frank K. Foster of the State\r\nFederation of Labor, Mrs. Livermore, Professor George E. Gardner of\r\nthe Boston University Law School, Mrs. May Alden Ward, president of\r\nthe State Federation of Women's Clubs, Mr. Blackwell and Mrs. Mead.\r\nThe State meeting was held at Attleboro, October 21, in the Opera\r\nHouse, with the usual list of well known speakers. The International\r\nPeace Congress, held in Boston this year, gave an impetus to the\r\nmovement. The men from abroad were much impressed by the American\r\nwomen. Other notable events were the celebration by the State W. C. T.\r\nU. of the quarter centennial of the granting of School suffrage and a\r\nconference of women ministers of different denominations, called by\r\nMrs. Howe. There was a Suffrage Day at the big Mechanics' Fair in\r\nBoston, with addresses by Miss Jane Addams, Miss Sheriff Bain of New\r\nZealand and W. P. Byles of England. A library of books bearing on the\r\nwoman question was started at headquarters with a fund given by Miss\r\nM. F. Munroe in memory of Mary Lowell Stone.\r\n\r\n1905. There was a very large attendance at the Festival on May 10,\r\nwith Mrs. Mead presiding. Professor Edward Cummings was toastmaster,\r\nex-Governor Garvin of Rhode Island and Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt spoke\r\nand the Festival then resolved itself into a celebration of Mr.\r\nBlackwell's 80th birthday (May 4), with the presentation of a silver\r\npitcher from the State association and addresses by William Lloyd\r\nGarrison and Mrs. Livermore. She had insisted upon coming, although by\r\nno means able. She said, \"Mr. Blackwell and I have worked together for\r\nnearly half a century; we have gone anywhere and everywhere for woman\r\nsuffrage. This evening he has been doing his best to persuade me to go\r\nout to the Oregon convention. I can not say half that ought to be said\r\nof his character, his devoted service, his fraternal spirit.\" She died\r\na few days later and there was profound sorrow for her loss.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the New England Association on May 11 Miss Blackwell\r\npresided. Francis J. Garrison was elected treasurer. The State annual\r\nmeeting was held at Holyoke, October 24, 25, in the Second Baptist\r\nChurch and Mayor Nathan P. Avery gave the address of welcome. Miss\r\nBlackwell was made chairman of the board of directors; Mrs. Mead was\r\nelected president; Mrs. Schlesinger vice-president. The association\r\ntook part in the celebration of the centennial of William Lloyd\r\nGarrison on December 10. He had been a life-long champion of equal\r\nrights for women and his last public speech was made at a suffrage\r\nhearing in the State House. There was a noteworthy memorial meeting\r\nfor Mrs. Edna D. Cheney, long a pillar of the suffrage association and\r\nof the New England Hospital for Women and Children. Catherine\r\nBreshkovsky, \"the little grandmother of the Russian revolution,\"\r\nvisited Massachusetts this year and addressed a number of meetings\r\narranged by the suffragists, including a large one in Faneuil Hall.\r\n\r\nThe convention was held in October, 1906, at Lowell in the Trinitarian\r\nCongregational Church. Harriet A. Eager gave a stone from the pavement\r\nof the little church at Delft Haven in Holland, where the Pilgrims\r\nattended their last religious service before sailing for America and\r\nthe association presented it to the Cape Cod Memorial Association to\r\nbe placed in the monument. The World's W. C. T. U. convention in\r\nBoston this month aroused much interest and enthusiasm. At the opening\r\nbanquet Miss Blackwell gave the address of welcome in behalf of the\r\nwomen's organizations.\r\n\r\n1907. The annual meeting took place in Worcester at Trinity Church.\r\nLetters were read from Colonel Thomas W. Higginson and Mrs. Elizabeth\r\nSmith Miller, the only two survivors of the 89 men and women who\r\nsigned the Call for the first National Woman's Rights Convention, held\r\nin Worcester in 1850; and a poem from the Rev. Antoinette L. Brown\r\nBlackwell, D. D., the only survivor of the speakers on that occasion.\r\nDr. Shaw gave an address and conducted a question box and there was a\r\nsymposium on Why I am a Suffragist by five young women, one a\r\ngrandniece and namesake of Margaret Fuller.\r\n\r\nA noteworthy meeting was held on March 23, 1907, by the Boston Equal\r\nSuffrage Association to consider \"the indebtedness of women of\r\ncollegiate and professional training to the leaders of the suffrage\r\nmovement.\" Every woman's college in the State was represented, as well\r\nas law and medicine. Mrs. Fanny B. Ames presided and college girls in\r\ncap and gown acted as ushers. The speakers were Mrs. Howe, Miss\r\nGeorgia L. White, Assistant Professor of Economics at Smith College;\r\nProfessor Helen M. Searles of Mt. Holyoke; Dr. Emma Culbertson of the\r\nNew England Hospital for Women and Children; Miss Emily Greene Balch,\r\nAssociate Professor of Economics and Sociology at Wellesley; Miss\r\nCaroline J. Cooke, instructor in Commercial Law at Simmons, and Mrs.\r\nPark of Radcliffe.\r\n\r\nOn August 13 suffragists from different parts of the State again made\r\na pilgrimage to Lucy Stone's old home, West Brookfield, to celebrate\r\nher birthday. Mrs. Cobden Sanderson, a daughter of Richard Cobden, one\r\nof the \"militant\" English suffragettes, spoke at the women's colleges\r\nand elsewhere. The Boston association, in connection with the Women's\r\nEducational and Industrial Union, gave courses in citizenship,\r\naddressed by heads of State and city departments. Mrs. Fessenden\r\nconducted many classes in Parliamentary practice (these were continued\r\nyear after year), and there was a \"suffrage day\" in the woman's\r\ndepartment of the great Food Fair.\r\n\r\nThe Association of Collegiate Alumnæ celebrated its quarter centennial\r\nin Boston November 5-9, which brought many distinguished suffragists\r\nfrom other States. In 1872 the New England Women's Club had given a\r\nreception for the only three college women then in this city. In 1907\r\nthis association had 3,147 members, several hundred of them in Boston\r\nalone. At the Whittier Centennial celebration at Amesbury on December\r\n17 the poet's championship of equal rights for women was recalled with\r\nhis work for other reforms. The Boston Federation of Suffrage\r\nSocieties was organized by the Association for Good Government. The\r\nState Federation of Labor and the State Letter Carriers' Association\r\nendorsed woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts Association Opposed to the Further Extension of\r\nSuffrage to Women changed its organ _The Remonstrance_ from an annual\r\nto a quarterly and sent out a copy broadcast. The suffragists followed\r\nwith an answer. The _Woman's Journal_ pointed out that the M. A. O. F.\r\nE. S. W., according to its own official reports, had sold $40.86 worth\r\nof literature in 1905, $13.50 worth in 1906 and $12.30 worth in 1907,\r\nand that in 1906 the total receipts were $2,907, of which $2,018 were\r\nexpended on salaries.[81]\r\n\r\n1908. The State annual meeting was held in Boston October 27, 28. Mrs.\r\nMead presided and Mrs. Ethel Snowden of England was the chief speaker.\r\nThere was a reception to Mrs. Howe, with addresses by Mrs. Maud Howe\r\nElliott, Mrs. Carota Von Koch of Sweden and Mrs. Howe. Miss Jane\r\nAddams gave suffrage lectures this year at Radcliffe, Smith, Mt.\r\nHolyoke and Wellesley colleges and Boston University, arranged by the\r\nCollege Equal Suffrage League, with large audiences and much\r\nenthusiasm. Mrs. Snowden spoke for the State association at Faneuil\r\nHall and a reception was given by the College and Boston suffrage\r\nassociations. Another large suffrage meeting in Faneuil Hall was\r\naddressed by Professor Charles Zueblin. Mrs. Park and Mrs. Eager held\r\na series of meetings in Berkshire county, arousing much interest. At\r\nthe suffrage booth in the Boston Food Fair, in charge of the Newton\r\nLeague, 6,255 names were added to the enrollment. The association by\r\nthis time had more than 100 local branches. This year 145 labor unions\r\nendorsed equal suffrage. The association carried on a \"poster\r\ncampaign,\" putting up posters in towns and at county fairs. Mrs.\r\nFitzGerald composed the inscriptions and Mrs. George F. Lowell with a\r\ngroup of friends put them up. At the Biennial of the General\r\nFederation of Women's Clubs held in Boston every mention of suffrage\r\nwas cheered and no one got such an ovation as Mrs. Howe, the fraternal\r\ndelegate from the National American Woman Suffrage Association.\r\n\r\n1909. The College Equal Suffrage League of Massachusetts attained a\r\nmembership of 320 this year and a suffrage club was formed at\r\nRadcliffe College. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology any\r\nnotices put up by the suffragists were at once torn down. The State\r\nannual convention was held in Boston October 22, 23, with the evening\r\nmeeting in Tremont Temple, and Miss Blackwell was elected president.\r\nFor the first time the report of the Legislative Committee was given\r\nby Mrs. Teresa A. Crowley, who continued to be its chairman for\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nEx-Governor Long presided at a memorial meeting for Henry B.\r\nBlackwell, with addresses by Edwin D. Mead, Julia Ward Howe, the Rev.\r\nCharles G. Ames, Professor Sumichrast, Moses H. Gulesian, Francis J.\r\nGarrison, James H. Stark of the Victorian Club, Meyer Bloomfield and\r\nMrs. Isabel C. Barrows. Mr. Blackwell was called by Mrs. Catt \"one of\r\nthe world's most heroic men.\" He was the only man of large abilities\r\nwho devoted his life to securing equal rights for women. In his youth\r\na reward of $10,000 was offered for his head at a public meeting in\r\nthe South because of his leading part in the rescue of a young slave\r\ngirl. He made his first speech for woman's rights at a suffrage\r\nconvention in Cleveland in 1853. Two years later he married Lucy\r\nStone. She had meant never to marry but to devote herself wholly to\r\nthe women's cause but he promised to devote himself to the same cause.\r\nHe was the unpaid secretary of the American Woman Suffrage Association\r\nfor twenty years, of the Massachusetts association for thirty years\r\nand of the New England association for nearly forty years. He traveled\r\nall over the country organizing suffrage societies, getting up\r\nconventions and addressing Legislatures. He attended the Republican\r\nnational conventions year after year trying to get a suffrage plank\r\nand in 1872 secured a mild one in the national platform and a strong\r\none in that of Massachusetts. He took part in constitutional amendment\r\ncampaigns in Kansas, Vermont, Colorado, Michigan, Rhode Island and\r\nSouth Dakota. In 1889, when Washington, Montana and North Dakota were\r\nabout to enter the Union as States, he attended the constitutional\r\nconvention of each to urge equal suffrage. He was an editor of the\r\n_Woman's Journal_ from its founding in 1870 till his death. An able\r\nwriter, an eloquent speaker, he was widely beloved for his kindness,\r\nhumor and geniality.\r\n\r\nMrs. Emmeline Pankhurst, the leader of the \"militant\" suffragettes of\r\nEngland, visited Boston this year. She was met at the station by the\r\nsuffragists with automobiles and flags and was taken through the\r\nstreets to the headquarters--Boston's first suffrage procession--and\r\nlater addressed in Tremont Temple a huge audience, critical at first,\r\nhighly enthusiastic at the close. A reception was given by prominent\r\nsuffragists to Miss Ethel M. Arnold of England, and there were\r\nlectures by her and Mrs. Charlotte Perkins Gilman; a series of\r\n\"petition teas\" and meetings addressed by Dr. Shaw, Miss Leonora\r\nO'Reilly, a labor leader of New York; Judge Ben Lindsey of Denver;\r\nCharles Edward Russell, the Rev. Thomas Cuthbert Hall; and by Mrs.\r\nSnowden, Dr. Stanton Coit and the Misses Rendell and Costello, all of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIn June the first of the open-air meetings that later became so\r\nimportant a feature of the campaign was held on the Common at Bedford.\r\nThe speakers were Mrs. FitzGerald, Mrs. Leonora S. Little, Mrs. Mary\r\nWare Dennett, Mrs. Katharine Dexter McCormick and Mrs. Crowley. The\r\nattendance was small; people were shy at first of seeming to\r\ncountenance such an innovation but the crowds grew as the meetings\r\ncontinued and it was found to be the best if not the only way to reach\r\nthe mass of voters. A summer campaign of 97 open-air meetings was\r\nheld, the speakers traveling mainly by trolley, covering a large part\r\nof the State and reaching about 25,000 persons.[82] Suffrage buttons\r\nand literature were distributed, posters put up, and sometimes mammoth\r\nkites flown to advertise the meetings. Mrs. H. S. Luscomb had\r\npresented a kite big enough to hold up a banner six feet wide by forty\r\ndeep. The campaigners were resourceful. At Nantasket, when forbidden\r\nto speak on the beach, they went into the water with their Votes for\r\nWomen banner and spoke from the sea to the audience on the shore.\r\n\r\n1910. Among the speakers at the Festival in May were Mrs. Frances\r\nSquire Potter, former Professor of English at the University of\r\nMinnesota; Professor Max Eastman of Columbia University, secretary of\r\nthe New York Men's League for Woman Suffrage, and Professor Henry S.\r\nNash of the Episcopal Theological School. At the State annual meeting\r\nin Lowell, October 27, 28, Philip Snowden, M. P., of England was a\r\nspeaker. In connection with the convention Mrs. Park spoke before the\r\nWoman's Club; Rabbi Fleischer before the Board of Trade; Miss Alice\r\nCarpenter at the Congregational Church in Tewksbury; four factory\r\nmeetings were held; the suffrage slides were exhibited twelve times at\r\nthe Merrimac Theater; Miss Foley and Miss Anne Withington addressed\r\nseven trade unions; 27,000 fliers were distributed and four street\r\nmeetings held.\r\n\r\nAn eight-weeks' summer campaign of open-air meetings was conducted\r\nthrough the great industrial cities of eastern Massachusetts, with\r\nfrom four to six regular and occasional special speakers. Three\r\nEnglishwomen, Miss Margaret G. Bondfield, Miss M. M. A. Ward and Miss\r\nEmily Gardner, reinforced the American speakers, Miss Foley, Mrs.\r\nFitzGerald, Mrs. Glendower Evans, Miss Emily Pierson of Connecticut,\r\nand others. In each city, besides the outdoor meetings, there was some\r\nspecial feature; in two, garden parties; in Brockton, the women joined\r\nthe circus parade, driving in a decorated team and giving out fliers.\r\nIn Fall River they got two popular stores to wrap a colored flier in\r\nevery parcel. In Taunton they had an evening band concert on the\r\nCommon, accompanied with red fire and speeches. In Lawrence Miss Foley\r\nmade a balloon ascension and showered down rainbow literature upon an\r\neager crowd. Several times the women spoke from the vaudeville stage\r\nand showed colored lantern slides. They spoke in parks and pleasure\r\nresorts and outside the factories as well as in the streets and at one\r\nYiddish and one French meeting. They held 200 meetings and talked to\r\nabout 60,000 persons. Afterwards they held outdoor meetings in and\r\nabout Boston and sent an automobile of speakers and literature to the\r\nAviation Meet. A fall campaign of open-air speaking followed. Mrs.\r\nPark came home from a tour around the world and lectured on the women\r\nof different countries. Mrs. A. Watson-Lister of Australia and Mrs.\r\nDora B. Montefiore of England addressed a number of meetings.\r\n\r\nA week of meetings took place in Springfield, State speakers\r\ncooperating with the local suffragists, among them Mrs. Henry\r\nPhillips, president of the suffrage league; Mrs. McDuffie and Mr.\r\nMyrick, publisher of the \"Farm and Home\" and \"Good Housekeeping.\"\r\nHeadquarters were opened in a vacant store with daily meetings and\r\nteas; addresses were given before the Board of Trade, the teachers,\r\nthe Woman's, the Mothers', the Socialist and the College Clubs, the Y.\r\nM. C. A. training school and other groups; colored slides of suffrage\r\nevents were shown and prominent local women opened their homes for\r\nsocial affairs. Much interest was aroused and permanent Springfield\r\nheadquarters were opened soon afterwards. Boston started to organize\r\nby wards and invitations were printed in various languages. The first\r\nmeeting, in Ward 8, arranged by Mrs. Leonard, was attended by nearly\r\n1,000 women and there were speeches in English and Yiddish. A class to\r\ntrain suffrage speakers was started. A suffrage club was organized in\r\nthe College of Liberal Arts of Boston University. The suffragists sent\r\nAlfred H. Brown to help the campaign in the State of Washington.\r\n\r\nThe general sorrow for the death of Julia Ward Howe on October 17\r\nbrought support to the suffrage movement. In her later years people\r\nhad revered her as they revered the flag and all her great influence\r\nhad been placed unreservedly at the service of this cause. A large\r\nmemorial meeting was held in Faneuil Hall on December 16.\r\n\r\n1911. The State convention was held in Boston October 27, 28, the\r\nevening meeting at Tremont Temple addressed by Dr. Shaw and Professor\r\nEdward Howard Griggs. The Boston association raised $1,100 for the\r\ncampaigns in Oregon, Kansas, Wisconsin and Michigan and gave Mrs.\r\nPark's services to Ohio and Michigan. A Men's League for Woman\r\nSuffrage was organized at Harvard University under the presidency of\r\nA. S. Olmstead. At the meeting of the New England Association Miss\r\nBlackwell was elected president. Mrs. Howe had held the office\r\ntwenty-six years.\r\n\r\nColonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson, one of the few surviving pioneers,\r\npassed away this year. He had been a champion of women's rights for\r\nmore than sixty years. When a young minister he spoke for the cause.\r\nHe signed the Call for the First National Woman's Rights Convention in\r\n1850. He married Lucy Stone and Henry B. Blackwell in 1855 and\r\nprefixed an approving foreword to their published protest against the\r\ninequalities of the marriage laws. He took part in organizing the\r\nAmerican Woman Suffrage Association, was its president for a year and\r\nan officer in the New England and Massachusetts associations until his\r\ndeath. For years he was a great power as a lecturer and writer and\r\naddressed suffrage conventions in many States. Beginning with 1870 he\r\ncontributed a long series of brilliant editorials to the _Woman's\r\nJournal_. He wrote four books on the woman question and gave 1,000\r\nbooks about women to the Boston Public Library. The founder of Smith\r\nCollege said she was led to leave her fortune for that purpose by\r\nreading his article, Ought Women Learn the Alphabet?\r\n\r\n1912. The State annual meeting was held in Boston, October 11, with an\r\nunusually large attendance from western Massachusetts. In 1913 it met\r\nin Boston May 27, 28. The executive secretary, Mrs. Marion Booth\r\nKelley, reported that 111 indoor meetings and 45 outdoor meetings had\r\nbeen held in the past six months. It was voted to have a suffrage\r\nparade in Boston the following spring. There was much doubt of the\r\npropriety of this but when a rising vote of the women present was\r\ntaken to see how many would march almost the whole convention rose.\r\n\r\n1914. The State annual meeting was held in Boston May 1 and 2, and\r\nagain in 1915 on May 13-15. The latter opened with a brilliant banquet\r\nat the Hotel Somerset, attended by about 800. Mrs. Park presided and\r\namong the speakers were ex-Governor Bass of New Hampshire, ex-Governor\r\nFoss of Massachusetts, Dr. Hugh Cabot and Mrs. Judith W. Smith, aged\r\n93. Suffrage clubs were reported at Wellesley, Smith and Mt. Holyoke\r\nColleges, the last formed largely through Miss Mildred Blodgett,\r\nassistant professor of geology. A band concert and a mass meeting on\r\nthe Common closed the convention.\r\n\r\n1916. At the State annual meeting in Boston May 18, 19, dues were\r\nabolished and provision made for organizing the State along political\r\nparty lines, as recommended by the National Association. Mrs. B. F.\r\nPitman of Brookline gave a large reception. The treasurer reported\r\nreceipts of $67,232, expenditures of $63,483.[83]\r\n\r\n1917. At the annual State meeting on May 10 resolutions were adopted\r\ncalling upon the 125,000 enrolled members to \"show their patriotism by\r\ndoing their utmost to help their country and the world,\" especially\r\nalong the five lines recommended by the National Suffrage Association;\r\nurging nation-wide prohibition as a war measure and commending the\r\nefforts to minimize moral dangers at the training camps; protesting\r\nagainst \"any attempt to lower educational standards or to weaken the\r\nlaws safeguarding the workers, especially women and children,\" because\r\nof the war emergency. The Twentieth Century Club rooms were crowded at\r\nthe New England Conference and Festival. Miss Blackwell presided. A\r\ngreeting from the National Association was brought by Mrs. Nettie\r\nRogers Shuler, its corresponding secretary, and speakers were present\r\nfrom all the New England States. Pledges and a collection were taken\r\nfor the Maine campaign and it was voted to give $2,000, a bequest from\r\nMiss Marian Shannon, to the National Association, to help it.\r\n\r\n1918. At the winter business meeting held in Fitchburg February 26\r\nMrs. Pitman reported that more than $30,000 had been raised by the\r\nassociation for war work. The State annual meeting in Boston on May\r\n24, 25 was crowded and exciting. A resolution pledging the\r\nassociation's support to the country in the war was passed by\r\nacclamation, and it responded to the request of Mrs. Catt, president\r\nof the National American Suffrage Association, to follow its program\r\nof war work. The convention voted with enthusiasm to take up the\r\ncirculation of the national petitions for the Federal Amendment and\r\nalso to give $600 to the National Association to finance an organizer\r\nin Oklahoma, where a suffrage campaign was in progress and the\r\nMassachusetts \"antis\" were financing the opposition. In the evening a\r\nmagnificent meeting was held in the Opera House with Mrs. Grace A.\r\nJohnson presiding and addresses by Mrs. Catt and Dr. Shaw. The\r\ncollection of $1,124 was given to the Red Cross.\r\n\r\nOn August 13 the State and Boston associations celebrated the\r\ncentenary of Lucy Stone's birth by a luncheon at the Hotel Somerset,\r\nMrs. Charles Sumner Bird presiding, with addresses by ex-Governor\r\nWalsh, the Rev. Antoinette Brown Blackwell, D. D., 93 years of age;\r\nMrs. Judith W. Smith, almost 97; Miss Blackwell and Mrs. Maud Howe\r\nElliott. Letters and telegrams of appreciation were received from\r\nPresident Wilson's secretary in his behalf; from Theodore Roosevelt,\r\nex-Governor McCall, Mrs. Catt, Mayor Andrew James Peters of Boston\r\nand many others. The fall meeting was held in Boston November 30, when\r\nMiss Mary Garrett Hay, national vice-president, spoke on the national\r\nsuffrage situation and there were addresses by heads of civic and\r\nphilanthropic organizations.\r\n\r\n1919. The mid-winter meeting was held in Worcester February 15 and\r\neight young girls presented to Miss Blackwell the national petition\r\nbearing 16,434 names, many more than the quota for this city. The\r\nState meeting was held May 21, 22, in Boston. While it was in session\r\nthe news came that the Federal Suffrage Amendment had passed the U. S.\r\nHouse of Representatives. This called out great enthusiasm and it was\r\nvoted to telegraph Mrs. Maud Wood Park: \"Three cheers for our\r\nCongressional Chairman! Very proud that Mrs. Park is a Massachusetts\r\nwoman!\" The following Sunday the Boston association held a meeting in\r\nTremont Theater to rejoice, with Samuel L. Powers, a prominent\r\nRepublican lawyer, presiding, and addresses by Mrs. Park, Joseph\r\nConry, a prominent Democrat, and Secretary of State Langtry for\r\nGovernor Coolidge.\r\n\r\n1920. The annual meeting was again held in Boston, May 27, 28, Mrs.\r\nBird presiding. She stated that it was the 100th anniversary of the\r\nbirth of Julia Ward Howe, to whose work for suffrage and other good\r\ncauses a heart-felt tribute was paid. Mrs. Bird presented Miss\r\nBlackwell with a laurel wreath as representing the pioneers and as\r\nhaving been at the head of the association when victory was won. As\r\nthe complete ratification was almost at hand it was voted to take\r\nlegal steps to dissolve the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association.\r\nLater it was decided, in accordance with the policy of the National\r\nAssociation, to continue it as a skeleton organization with the same\r\nofficers until all possible need for it should be over. The State\r\nLeague of Women Voters was organized, with Mrs. George R. Fearing,\r\nJr., as chairman and Miss Blackwell as honorary president, the\r\ndelegates and members of the association enrolling in the new society.\r\nThe New England Woman Suffrage Association never formally disbanded\r\nbut simply ceased to meet.\r\n\r\nFrom 1910 onward what had tended most to increase membership was the\r\nformation of the Woman Suffrage Party to work as the State\r\nassociation, with a non-dues-paying membership of men and women,\r\nsimilar to the political parties, having district leaders, precinct\r\ncaptains and ward chairmen, strictly non-partisan and solely to\r\npromote woman suffrage. The first chairman was Mrs. Gertrude Halladay\r\nLeonard. A convention was held in Faneuil Hall on March 5, 1912, at\r\nwhich time twenty-three of the twenty-six Boston wards had been\r\norganized, also Brookline, Cambridge, Somerville, Newton and many\r\nother cities and towns. The membership was 25,000 and by the\r\nreferendum campaign in 1915 it had advanced to about 250,000.\r\n\r\nThis change in the type of organization was indicative of a change in\r\nthe whole suffrage movement. It was recognized that more widely\r\ndiffused education on the subject was needed and that suffrage must\r\nbecome a political issue. The suffrage leagues were changed into\r\npolitical district organizations; the parlor meeting gave place to the\r\noutdoor meeting; State headquarters were moved from No. 6 Marlboro\r\nStreet, a residential section, to 585 Boylston Street in a business\r\nbuilding, and local societies were kept in touch. Every effort was\r\nmade to reach labor unions and other organizations of men with\r\nspeakers and educational propaganda and to carry information to the\r\nman in the street, who often had never heard of the Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation. The executive board met every two weeks and later every\r\nweek or oftener. Mrs. Page, its chairman, was followed in 1911 by Mrs.\r\nMarion Booth Kelley; in 1912 by Mrs. Gertrude B. Newell, and in May,\r\n1913, Mrs. Leonard was elected and served to October, 1917. Upon her\r\nresignation Mrs. Grace A. Johnson was chosen, who was succeeded by\r\nMrs. Charles Sumner Bird.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 a new State organization, called the Political Equality Union,\r\nwas formed, with Miss Mabel Gillespie as chairman, Mrs. FitzGerald as\r\nsecretary and Dr. Lily Burbank as treasurer, which made a special\r\neffort to reach the labor men and women. As the vote on the\r\nconstitutional amendment approached, in order that there might be no\r\noverlapping, ten per cent. of the State was assigned as a field for\r\nthe work of the Union and the rest for that of the State association.\r\nThe two cooperated in legislative work. The Union disbanded in\r\nNovember, 1916, advising its members to join the State association.\r\n\r\nCAMPAIGN. Through the campaign year of 1914, preceding the vote on a\r\nconstitutional amendment, which had been submitted by the Legislature,\r\nthe association kept five salaried speakers continually in the field,\r\nbesides numerous volunteers. On the list of the speakers' bureau there\r\nwere 125 women and 76 men. The State and the Boston headquarters had a\r\nlarge office force, and in the field were nine organizers, giving full\r\nor half time. The State College Equal Suffrage League handled the\r\nretail literature for the association and took charge of the office\r\nhospitality. The Equal Franchise Committee, Mrs. Robert Gould Shaw,\r\npresident, had an important part in the campaign. The Men's League for\r\nWoman Suffrage was reorganized with Oakes Ames as president and Joseph\r\nKelley as secretary. The Harvard Men's League cooperated in many ways.\r\nThe use of one of the University Halls for a speech by Mrs. Pankhurst\r\nwas refused to it, much to the chagrin of liberal-minded graduates and\r\nundergraduates, but she held a very successful meeting in a nearby\r\nhall. The use of a hall was refused also for Mrs. Florence Kelley,\r\nalthough she had spoken at Harvard on other subjects. In order to\r\navoid further trouble the Harvard Corporation voted that thereafter no\r\nwoman should be allowed to lecture in the college halls except by its\r\nspecial invitation. This rule was abandoned later and Miss Helen Todd\r\nof California spoke on suffrage in Emerson Hall before a large\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nOther suffrage organizations sprang up or were enlarged, the Writers'\r\nLeague, the Players' League, etc. Local branches were built up rapidly\r\nunder the leadership of Mrs. Pinkham, State organization chairman, and\r\nby the spring of 1914 there were 138 leagues and committees. Just\r\nbefore the vote in November, 1915, these had grown to 200. Monthly\r\nconferences of the district leaders were held at State headquarters. A\r\nsystematic effort was made to build up strong suffrage organizations\r\nin the cities outside of Boston. Workers and speakers were sent\r\nthrough the State to help the local workers. In 1914 a series of\r\ntwo-day conferences was held in eleven of the sixteen counties, the\r\nfirst day devoted to discussion of work with local leaders and the\r\nsecond to holding often as many as twenty meetings by a corps of\r\nspeakers, at factories, stores, men's clubs, labor unions, church\r\norganizations, on the street, etc.\r\n\r\nTo educate the men who were to vote upon the question, a State-wide\r\ncanvass of voters was begun by Mrs. Crowley, which was carried on up\r\nto election day. A body of from five to seven intelligent women,\r\ninformed on the question, re-enforced by local volunteers, called from\r\nhouse to house, talking to the voter or his wife, leaving suffrage\r\nliterature and if possible getting the voter's signature to a card\r\npledge to vote yes. These canvassers moved from city to city and from\r\ntown to town, reaching from one-half to two-thirds of the registered\r\nvoters, averaging about 1,500 calls per week and leaving the rest of\r\nthe work to be carried on by local women. By election day over 250,000\r\nvoters had been interviewed, 100,000 had signed pledge cards and more\r\nthan 50,000 others had expressed themselves as favorable.\r\n\r\nMuch of this work was made possible by the activities of the Ways and\r\nMeans Committee of the State Association, under the chairmanship of\r\nMrs. B. F. Pitman, who, during the many years that she served in that\r\ncapacity, repeatedly rescued the association from the verge of debt\r\nand filled up its treasury. Her committee accomplished this by a Bay\r\nState Bazaar held every year at the Copley Plaza Hotel in Boston; by\r\nballs, theatrical performances, outdoor fêtes, pageants and other\r\nentertainments.\r\n\r\nAs an extra provision for the campaign of 1915, the Bay State Finance\r\nCommittee was formed in 1914 by Mrs. Park, chairman, which with the\r\nState association raised and spent about $54,000 in the campaign. This\r\nwas exclusive of the money spent by the various leagues and branches\r\nthroughout the State, including $10,820 by the Boston Association for\r\nGood Government.\r\n\r\nFor two years educational work was pushed in every way. It was carried\r\ninto the country districts by systematic trolley and automobile trips,\r\nparties of workers carrying out well planned itineraries in different\r\nparts of the State, involving usually from two to four open-air\r\nmeetings per day. Audiences were secured in all the small and\r\nscattered places, even the most remote, by postal notices mailed from\r\nState headquarters several days in advance to every registered voter.\r\n\r\nAmong the means employed to draw attention were huge \"Votes for\r\nWomen\" kites, voiceless speeches (a series of placards held up to view\r\nin a store window or other public place), distribution of literature\r\nin the baseball parks; a suffrage automobile or a section in the\r\nparades on Labor Day, Columbus Day, etc.; a pilgrimage to Worcester on\r\nthe anniversary of the First National Woman's Rights Convention, led\r\nby Miss Florence Luscomb in old-fashioned costume, in Lucy Stone's\r\ncarriage; the running of propaganda films in the moving pictures and\r\nthe placing of 100,000 brightly painted tin Blue Birds in conspicuous\r\nplaces throughout the State, each bird bearing the words \"Votes for\r\nWomen, Nov. 2, 1919.\" There were speakers and debates at men's clubs,\r\nchurch organizations, labor unions, in factories, granges, at cattle\r\nshows and at conventions of all sorts.\r\n\r\nLarge indoor meetings were held, addressed by distinguished visitors\r\nto the State, among them Philip Snowden and Mrs. Snowden, Senator\r\nHelen Ring Robinson of Colorado, U. S. Senators Clapp of Minnesota,\r\nKenyon of Iowa and Thomas of Colorado. Mrs. Pankhurst and her daughter\r\nSylvia spoke in Boston and Cambridge with great success. Louis D.\r\nBrandeis, afterwards Justice of the U. S. Supreme Court, came out for\r\nwoman suffrage. In Boston, under the direction of Miss Mabel Caldwell\r\nWillard, innumerable street meetings were held for a year before the\r\nvote, with mass meetings every Sunday in the Tremont Theater and on\r\nthe historic Common.\r\n\r\nPress material was supplied to city and country papers. The newspapers\r\nas a whole grew more favorable as time went by but their editorial\r\npages were much more friendly than the news columns, which frequently\r\ncarried stories that were unfair or wholly untrue. The Boston _Sunday\r\nHerald_ printed regular suffrage notes for some months before the vote\r\nand once the daily edition gave the suffragists a full page. The\r\nBoston _American_ let them issue a special supplement, in charge of\r\nMrs. Jennette A. S. Jeffrey and Mrs. Leonard, and this example was\r\nfollowed by other papers in the State. As always, the _Woman's\r\nJournal_ did much to hold together, encourage and stimulate the\r\nworkers. A special committee distributed more than 100,000 copies of\r\nsuffrage speeches made in Congress and more than 300,000 pieces of\r\nother literature within the last few months before the election.\r\n\r\nThe most impressive publicity put forth by the State association was\r\nthe two parades in Boston; the first held May 2, 1914, and the second,\r\nOct. 16, 1915, just before the election. The first one caused a\r\nsensation. It contained about 12,000 women, with a small section of\r\nmen, and was conducted under the chairmanship of Mrs. Leonard, with\r\nMrs. Page, Mrs. Johnson and nine sub-committee chairmen. It was\r\nextremely well organized and the large mass of totally untrained\r\nmarchers was handled so efficiently as to surprise all who saw it.\r\nDelegations from all over New England took part and one from\r\nAustralia; women in national costumes; nurses in uniform; delegations\r\nfrom all the women's colleges in the State and men and women from the\r\nuniversities; also a singing chorus trained by Dr. Archibald Davidson,\r\nJr., of Appleton Chapel, Harvard. In the procession were a son, three\r\ngrandsons, a granddaughter and two granddaughters-in-law of William\r\nLloyd Garrison; the daughter of Abby Kelley Foster, the\r\ndaughter-in-law of Angelina Grimké and Theodore Weld and the daughter\r\nof Lucy Stone and Henry B. Blackwell. The Concord banner was carried\r\nby the grandniece of Louisa M. Alcott. Arrangements had been made for\r\na delegation from the Boston Central Labor Union but when the time\r\ncame the sole marcher to appear was the president, who courageously\r\nmarched alone carrying the banner of the union.\r\n\r\nThe second, called the Victory Parade, was even more successful. It\r\nincluded about 15,000 marchers with a substantial men's section and\r\nwas viewed by 500,000 people. It was reviewed by Governor David I.\r\nWalsh in front of the State House and Mayor James Michael Curley in\r\nfront of the City Hall and was followed by a tremendous mass meeting\r\nin Mechanics' Building, addressed by the Mayor and others. Parades\r\nwere held also in other large cities.\r\n\r\nThe State Federation of Women's Clubs at its annual meeting in 1915\r\nendorsed woman suffrage, on motion of Mrs. Herbert J. Gurney, by a\r\nvote of 203 to 99. The extreme to which bitter feeling ran was shown\r\nby a widely advertised attempt to organize a Non-partisan League among\r\nthe club women in consequence but only a few hundred joined out of a\r\nfederation membership of 65,000. It had been endorsed by the General\r\nFederation and by 28 State federations but in no other had the\r\ndefeated minority undertaken to organize another society.\r\n\r\nThirty county fairs out of thirty-seven were covered systematically.\r\nSpecial help in the campaign work was given by Ohio, Nebraska, Nevada,\r\nNew Hampshire, Rhode Island and Connecticut. The question of woman\r\nsuffrage was presented before 621 organizations of men through the\r\nefforts of a committee formed for that purpose, under Mrs. Evelyn\r\nPeverly Coe's chairmanship. Women attended nearly all the primaries\r\nand town meetings, distributing literature and urging the men to vote\r\nyes.\r\n\r\nAs the election approached the work along all lines grew more\r\nintensive. Well-organized victory automobile tours ran steadily\r\nthroughout the summer and fall, in the eastern part of the State under\r\nthe direction of Mrs. Walter G. Morey and in the western under Miss\r\nLuscomb. Meetings were held at the fashionable hotels on the north and\r\nsouth shores and outdoor meetings at the popular beach resorts.\r\nComparatively few were held indoors but 1,675 were supplied with\r\nspeakers. Big meetings were addressed in Boston and other large cities\r\nby U. S. Senator William E. Borah and Dr. Anna Howard Shaw. An\r\nelaborate luncheon was given by the Men's League and the State\r\nassociation at the Hotel Bellevue to the Governors' conference held in\r\nBoston. Valuable help at this time was rendered by Governor Walsh and\r\nthe favorable opinions of the Governors of equal suffrage States were\r\npublished at length in the Boston papers by the Men's League. At the\r\nlast moment mass meetings were held in Boston at Symphony Hall and in\r\nthe largest halls of many other cities. A symbolical and picturesque\r\nflag-raising took place on Boston Common. A last-minute circular was\r\nsent to each of the State's 600,000 registered voters. The day before\r\nthe vote the railroad stations in Boston were visited morning and\r\nevening and thousands of pieces of literature were given to the\r\ncommuters.\r\n\r\nOn election day, Nov. 2, 1915, practically all the polling places in\r\nthe State were covered by 8,000 women, who stood for hours holding\r\naloft placards reading, \"Show your Faith in the Women of\r\nMassachusetts; vote 'Yes' on Woman Suffrage.\" And yet after all this\r\nstrenuous effort and self-sacrificing devotion the amendment was\r\ndefeated by a vote of 295,489 to 163,406, a majority of 132,000. The\r\nvote in Boston was: Noes, 53,654; ayes, 31,428; opposing majority,\r\n22,226.\r\n\r\nLouis D. Brandeis said in an address on Columbus Day: \"I doubt if\r\nthere has been carried on ever in Massachusetts--certainly not in my\r\nlifetime--a campaign which for intelligence, devotion and intensity\r\nsurpassed the campaign of the women for suffrage. It should silence\r\nany doubt as to their fitness for enfranchisement.\" The suffragists,\r\nhowever, had to contend with serious and insuperable difficulties. The\r\npopulation of the State had changed radically since the early days\r\nwhen Massachusetts had been the starting point of liberal movements.\r\nFor more than half a century its most progressive citizens had been\r\ngoing west and their places had been filled by wave after wave of\r\nimmigration from Europe, largely ignorant and imbued with the Old\r\nWorld ideas as to the subjection of women. The religious question also\r\nentered in, and, while the Catholic Church took no stand as to woman\r\nsuffrage, many Catholics believed that it would be a step toward\r\nSocialism, against which the church was making a vigorous contest. On\r\nthe other hand, many Protestants believed that the Catholic women's\r\nvotes would be unduly influenced by the priests.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts was the home of the oldest and most influential\r\nanti-suffrage organization of women in the United States under the\r\nleadership of Mrs. Charles Eliot Guild, Miss Mary Ames, Mrs. James\r\nCodman, Mrs. Charles P. Strong and others. Few of its members did any\r\nactive work but they were connected through the men of their families\r\nwith the richest, most powerful and best organized groups of men in\r\nthe State, who worked openly or behind the scenes against woman\r\nsuffrage. They had an influence out of all proportion to their\r\nnumbers. Most of the literature, most of the money and a liberal\r\nsupply of speakers for anti-suffrage campaigns all over the country\r\nhad emanated from this association. While always posing as a woman's\r\nprotest, the real strength of the movement was in the men.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1912, a Man's Anti-Suffrage Association had been organized,\r\nits Executive Committee consisting of ten lawyers, one cotton broker,\r\none Technology Professor, the treasurer of Harvard College and the\r\ntreasurer of the Copley Society. Other societies were organized\r\nlater. All through the summer and fall of 1915 the women's and the\r\nmen's organizations and various groups and combinations of men, who\r\nfor one reason or another did not want equal suffrage, worked publicly\r\nand privately in every conceivable way against the amendment. They\r\nheld meetings, mostly indoor, sent out speakers, advertised in street\r\ncars, prepared and mailed to every voter at great expense an elaborate\r\npamphlet, The Case Against Woman Suffrage, full of misrepresentations,\r\nand did all an active opposition could do, and they had an efficient\r\nand highly paid Publicity Committee. The liquor interests fought the\r\namendment from start to finish. Pink slips were passed out in saloons\r\non election day, saying, \"Good for two drinks if woman suffrage is\r\ndefeated.\"\r\n\r\nThe vote was curiously uniform. Every part of the State gave an\r\nadverse majority; so did every city and town except Tewksbury and\r\nCarver; and generally in about the same proportion--places with strong\r\nsuffrage organizations and places with none; whether the work done in\r\nthem had been much or little; even towns where a majority of the\r\nvoters had signed pledge cards promising to vote for the amendment\r\nvoted adversely and in about the same ratio. The vote was the largest\r\never cast on any amendment in the State. By appealing adroitly to all\r\nkinds of prejudices, as on the religious question, the opposition got\r\nout an enormous number of men who generally did not vote at all.\r\n\r\nBoth sides were required by law to file at the State House a record of\r\ntheir campaign expenses. An analysis of the lists showed that the bulk\r\nof the anti-suffrage campaign fund was made up of personal\r\ncontributions, four-fifths of them from men, and more than\r\nthree-fifths of the total from 135 men, whose average donation was\r\n$235. The slogan of their campaign had been that women did not want to\r\nvote. The official figures showed that those who claimed to speak for\r\n\"80 per cent. of the women\" received 80 per cent. of their\r\ncontributions from men, and not from the rank and file of men but\r\nchiefly from bankers, brokers and powerful directors of the monied\r\nsection of Boston. The bulk of the suffrage campaign fund came from\r\nfairs, sales and entertainments and of the personal contributions more\r\nthan four-fifths were from women, their average donation being $17.\r\n\r\nAfter the election in 1915 there was started a State branch of the\r\nCongressional Union, later called the National Woman's Party, formed\r\nsome years before to push the Federal Amendment. It was under the\r\nleadership of Mrs. Morey, chairman, and other women most of whom had\r\nbeen active with the State association during the campaign. The defeat\r\nof the State amendment caused the work of all organizations to be\r\ndirected toward the submission of the Federal Amendment.\r\n\r\nAt the annual meeting of the State association in May, 1916, a budget\r\nof $30,000 was adopted and $20,000 toward it was pledged on the spot.\r\nThrough the preceding winter the association had five paid organizers,\r\ntwo of them working in Boston, and a large number of volunteer field\r\nworkers, at least 230 in Boston alone. Besides the chairmen for the\r\nsixteen congressional districts, each of the forty senatorial\r\ndistricts had its chairman, all working under the State Chairman of\r\nOrganization, Mrs. Sara S. Gilson. She was followed by Mrs. Mary P.\r\nSleeper and by Mrs. Elizabeth Tilton, who formed an Advisory Council\r\nof 100 influential men in preparation for the campaign to ratify the\r\nFederal Amendment.\r\n\r\nAfter the United States entered the World War in 1917 the suffrage\r\norganizations, State and local, devoted their efforts largely to\r\nvarious forms of war work, called for by the Government. They served\r\non all committees, took part in all \"drives,\" sold Liberty Bonds and\r\ncontinued their service till the last demand had been met.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. The Massachusetts Legislature began in 1869 to\r\ngrant hearings to women asking for the franchise and it continued to\r\ndo so every year thereafter. These hearings usually crowded the\r\nlargest committee room at the State House, the throng often extending\r\nfar out into the hall. Able arguments were presented by eminent men\r\nand women but it was impossible to obtain favorable action. There was\r\nat least one hearing every year and often several on different\r\nmeasures. In later years they were generally conducted by Mrs. Maud\r\nWood Park, Miss Amy F. Acton, a young woman lawyer, or Miss Alice\r\nStone Blackwell for the petitioners; and by Thomas Russell, Aaron H.\r\nLatham, Charles R. Saunders or Robert Luce, as attorney for the\r\nAnti-Suffrage Association. Miss Blackwell usually replied for the\r\npetitioners. In recent years the suffragists had influential\r\npoliticians of both parties to speak at the hearings, thus making\r\nwoman suffrage a political question.\r\n\r\n1901. The State association asked for the Municipal and Presidential\r\nfranchise and for the submission to the voters of a constitutional\r\namendment giving full suffrage. At the hearing on the latter, held\r\nFebruary 18, the crowd broke all records and members of the committee\r\nwho came late had to reach their seats by walking on top of the long\r\ntable. Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt was among the speakers.[84] The\r\nmeasure was defeated March 11 by a vote, including pairs, of 156 to\r\n53. Individuals petitioned for Municipal suffrage for women taxpayers,\r\nwhich was referred to the next Legislature without a roll call.\r\n\r\n1902. The association's petition for a constitutional amendment was\r\ndebated in the House on March 5 and defeated by a vote (including\r\npairs) of 153 to 61. Petitions from individuals for Municipal suffrage\r\nfor taxpaying women and that women qualified to vote for school\r\ncommittee might vote in the primaries on the nominations for it and a\r\npetition of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union that women might\r\nvote on licenses, were all rejected, after lively hearings. The\r\nAnti-Suffrage Association opposed all of them.\r\n\r\nThe great legislative triumph of 1902 was the passage of the Equal\r\nGuardianship bill. Ever since Lucy Stone in 1847 began to urge the\r\namendment of the old law, which gave the father absolute control, the\r\nsuffragists had endeavored to have it changed. Bill after bill, drawn\r\nby Samuel E. Sewall and others, had been introduced and rejected and\r\nit required a tragedy to obtain a new law. Mrs. Naramore of Coldbrook,\r\nMass., went insane and killed her six young children when she learned\r\nthat their father intended to give them away and could legally do so.\r\nThis deeply stirred the Rev. Charles H. Talmage, who had conducted the\r\nfuneral service, with the six little coffins ranged before the pulpit.\r\nHe made a careful inquiry into all the circumstances and gave a full\r\naccount of them in the Boston _Herald_ of April 15, 1901 (republished\r\nin the _Woman's Journal_ of April 27). He gave his time and the State\r\nSuffrage Association paid his expenses while he went through the State\r\nenlisting the support of different organizations of women to secure a\r\nchange in the law. Mr. Blackwell also put in much time for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nWhen the Equal Guardianship bill was introduced by Representative\r\nGeorge H. Fall of Malden it was backed not only by the suffrage\r\nassociation but by the State Federation of Women's Clubs, the State W.\r\nC. T. U., the Women's Relief Corps, the Boston Children's Friend\r\nSociety and more than a hundred other organizations, aggregating\r\n34,000 women. Among them the Anti-Suffrage Association was not\r\nincluded. For six years it had been circulating, under its official\r\nimprint, a leaflet against the proposal to give mothers equal custody\r\nand control of the children and in defense of the law as it stood.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Probate and Chancery reported adversely by 8 to 3.\r\nThe outlook for its passage seemed so dark that Mr. Fall came to the\r\n_Woman's Journal_ office and asked if it might not be better to drop\r\nit and await a more propitious time. Miss Blackwell urged him to push\r\nit to a test. On May 27 it was debated in the House. Representative\r\nMarshall of Gloucester said that the Probate Judges were all opposed\r\nto it; that its advocates were \"sentimentalists\" and that \"it would\r\ncreate strife, separation and divorce.\" He added: \"Those who appeared\r\nfor it before the committee were practically the same crowd that\r\nappeared for woman suffrage.\" Representative Sleeper exclaimed: \"If\r\nyou want to enact legislation which will disrupt the home and sunder\r\nthe tenderest and most sacred relations, pass this bill!\" The House\r\nrejected the committee's adverse report by a viva voce vote and the\r\nnext day passed the bill without further debate. It passed the Senate\r\nby a large majority. Thanks and praises were showered upon\r\nRepresentative Fall, who modestly said that two-thirds of the credit\r\nfor working up the case belonged to his wife, Mrs. Anna Christy Fall.\r\n\r\n1903. The bill for taxpayers' Municipal suffrage was defeated February\r\n5 without a roll call; the association's petition for a constitutional\r\namendment by 99 to 87.\r\n\r\n1904. Governor John L. Bates recommended woman suffrage in his\r\nMessage. The association asked for Municipal suffrage for women having\r\nthe same qualifications required of men. The bill was debated in the\r\nHouse on February 16 and defeated without a roll call. The bill to let\r\nwomen vote on nominations for school trustees was defeated by 62 to\r\n30.\r\n\r\n1905. The association's petition for a constitutional amendment was\r\nrejected without a division and without even discussion. Petitions\r\nwere rejected for License suffrage, for a vote on school nominations\r\nand to enable women to vote for the appointing officer if the Boston\r\nschool board should be made appointive instead of elective. The\r\nassociation always joined with other societies in asking for measures\r\nfor the public welfare.\r\n\r\n1906. The association's petition for a constitutional amendment was\r\ndebated March 23 and defeated without a roll call. One headed by John\r\nGolden, president of the Textile Workers, for Municipal suffrage for\r\nwage-earning women was also defeated without a division, as were the\r\npetitions for License suffrage and for a vote on school nominations.\r\n\r\n1907. The constitutional amendment was debated February 20 and\r\ndefeated by 125 to 14. The Good Templars asked for License suffrage\r\nfor women. At the hearing the bill was supported by representatives of\r\nthe Anti-Saloon League, the W. C. T. U., the Christian Endeavorers,\r\netc., and opposed by the Anti-Suffrage Association and the attorney of\r\nthe Wine and Spirits Wholesale Dealers' Association. A bill requiring\r\nthat the same measures be taken to keep the names of women voters\r\n(school) on the register as the names of men failed to pass.\r\n\r\n1908. Municipal suffrage for all women, asked for by the association,\r\nwas vigorously debated and voted down by 99 to 30. Municipal suffrage\r\nfor women taxpayers, asked for by individuals, was defeated without a\r\nroll call.\r\n\r\n1909. At the hearing on February 23 the Boston _Herald_, which was not\r\nin favor of equal suffrage, estimated that 2,000 women besieged the\r\nState House. They crowded the corridors and the large portico until\r\ntwo great overflow meetings were held in the open air at either end of\r\nthe broad stairway leading up to the entrance. Later the overflow\r\nmeeting moved on to the Common. The huge crowd of women made a deep\r\nimpression and was largely featured in the press, which said that\r\nnothing like it had ever been seen in Boston.[85] The hearing was\r\nconducted for the petitioners by Mrs. Crowley and for the \"antis\" by\r\nMr. Saunders. He was so impressed by the crowd that his usual sneering\r\nand jeering manner was wholly changed. The suffrage speakers were Dr.\r\nShaw, John F. Tobin, president of the Boot and Shoe Workers' Union;\r\nRabbi Charles Fleischer, Miss Josephine Casey, secretary of the\r\nWomen's Trade Union League; Henry Abrahams of the Central Labor Union;\r\nMiss Rose Brennan of Fall River, Miss Blackwell, Miss Eleanor Rendell\r\nof England, Winfield Tuck and Mrs. Belle Davis. Mrs. Gorham Dana,\r\nProfessor Sedgwick and Mrs. George spoke for the \"antis.\" Mrs. Julia\r\nWard Howe and Ex-Governor Bates, who were to have spoken for suffrage,\r\ncould not get into the room.[86] The constitutional amendment was\r\ndebated March 23. The galleries were reserved for women, yet many were\r\nturned away. The vote stood 171 noes to 54 ayes, including 11 pairs.\r\n\r\n1910. The hearing February 23 on a constitutional amendment was\r\nunusually impressive. It was held in the evening to enable women busy\r\nby day to attend. In the past two or three members of the Legislature\r\nnot on the committee had sometimes dropped in. This year about sixty\r\nwere present. Mrs. Crowley and Mrs. Luce conducted the hearing for the\r\ntwo sides. The petitioners had arranged delegations representing\r\ndifferent groups of women--mothers, home-makers, leisure women,\r\nlawyers, mission and church workers, artists, authors and journalists,\r\ndoctors and nurses, Socialists, W. C. T. U., the \"unrepresented\"\r\n(widows and single women), business women, trade unions, teachers,\r\nsocial workers, taxpayers, saleswomen, clerks and stenographers and\r\ncollege women. These 1,500 or more marched to the State House from\r\nFord Hall, each group under its own banner, and presented themselves\r\nbefore the committee in turn, the spokeswoman of each group telling\r\nbriefly why she, and women like her, wanted the ballot. Then they went\r\nover to Ford Hall, where a big rally was held and the main address was\r\nmade by Mrs. Fanny Garrison Villard. An overflow meeting was held on\r\nthe State House steps addressed by Edwin D. Mead and others. In order\r\nto line up the labor vote in the Legislature, resolutions by different\r\nlabor unions, signed by their secretaries, were sent to each\r\nlegislator, under the direction of Mrs. Page. The measure was defeated\r\nMarch 31 by 148 to 47.\r\n\r\n1911. For the first time in many years, the Legislative Committee of\r\nthe State association, Mrs. Crowley, chairman, appeared, before the\r\nResolutions Committee of the political parties to urge the adoption of\r\na suffrage plank. The Democratic party inserted one favoring the\r\nsubmission of the question to the voters; the Republican party ignored\r\nit. The legislators were interviewed both at the State House and by\r\nrepresentative suffragists within their districts, and they received\r\nsuffrage literature. The hearing on February 23 was unusually\r\nsuccessful from a political and publicity standpoint. It was conducted\r\nby Mrs. Crowley and was addressed by Mrs. Park and Mrs. Katharine\r\nDexter McCormick; John Sherman Weaver, representing the State branch\r\nof the American Federation of Labor, and Henry Abrahams for the Boston\r\nCentral Labor Union. Sylvia Pankhurst addressed the committee in a\r\nsimple and effective way. Two of the opposition speakers were Mrs.\r\nGeorge and Professor Sedgwick. The debate was spirited and was\r\nconducted for the suffragists by prominent Senators and\r\nRepresentatives. Four members spoke in opposition. The vote in the\r\nHouse was ayes, 69, noes, 161; in the Senate, ayes, 6, noes, 31.\r\nDuring all these years a quiet but effective opposition had been\r\nworking at the State House under the direction of Charles R. Saunders,\r\nlegislative counsel for the Anti-Suffrage Association.\r\n\r\nOne of the most significant features in the fall of 1911 was the\r\npolitical work of Miss Margaret Foley, as it marked the beginning of a\r\nnew type of effort. She had made a special trip to England the year\r\nbefore with Miss Florence Luscomb and Miss Alice Carpenter to observe\r\nthe methods of the English suffragettes, who were then receiving great\r\npublicity. After her return she began by attending with other women\r\nthe political rallies of the various candidates for the State\r\nLegislature and at the close of each rally asking the candidate how he\r\nstood on the question of Votes for Women. By her knowledge of crowd\r\npsychology and gift as a speaker, she was able not only to handle but\r\nto win the roughest crowd to the consternation of the candidates. When\r\nthe candidates for Governor started on their campaign, Miss Foley,\r\nwith a group of workers, followed the Republican candidate in a fast\r\nautomobile, attended all his meetings, spoke to the crowd on suffrage\r\nafter the Republican speeches were over and questioned the candidates\r\nfor Governor and other State officers as to their stand on suffrage.\r\nThis unique and somewhat sensational method was taken up with avidity\r\nby the newspapers, which gave it front-page articles with\r\nillustrations. Later she turned her attention to the Democratic\r\ncandidates. This was kept up until election and suffrage facts and\r\narguments were presented to thousands of voters who would never\r\notherwise have heard them.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 the Legislative Committee, Miss Mary Gay, chairman, conducted\r\nthe hearing on February 26. Afterwards a special letter of thanks was\r\nsent to Professor Lewis J. Johnson of Harvard and the Hon. Joseph\r\nWalker for their help at the hearing. The amendment had able support\r\nfrom members and the campaign work began to show results. The vote in\r\nthe House was ayes, 96, noes, 116; in the Senate, aye's, 14, noes, 17.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn the method was introduced which many believed was\r\nultimately responsible for putting the amendment through the\r\nLegislature. It was the defeating of individual legislators who had\r\nbeen prominent opponents by making an active political campaign in\r\ntheir districts. The first was begun at the primaries against State\r\nSenator Roger Wolcott of Milton, chairman of the Constitutional\r\nAmendments Committee in the preceding Legislature. The women compiled\r\na record of his negative votes on many liberal measures, including\r\nsuffrage, and spread this record before his constituents. This work\r\nwas done at the suggestion and under the direction of Mrs. Fitzgerald,\r\nwho conducted open-air meetings in the district. The effort to defeat\r\nhis renomination in the primary failed, however, largely through their\r\ninexperience. The Legislative Committee at the time consisted of Mrs.\r\nCrowley, chairman, Mrs. Leonard, Mrs. Park, Mrs. Page, Miss Foley and\r\nMrs. Mary Agnes Mahan and remained substantially the same during the\r\nnext two or three years, with the addition of Mrs. Marie Burress\r\nCurrier, Miss Cora Start and Mrs. Evelyn Peverley Coe. Then they made\r\na fight against Mr. Wolcott's election and by a most thorough campaign\r\ndefeated him at the polls and a Democrat was returned from that\r\ndistrict for the first time in many years.\r\n\r\nThis year marked the high tide of the Progressive party in\r\nMassachusetts. It had put a straight suffrage plank in its platform\r\nand its members in the Legislature were very helpful. The defeat of\r\nWolcott, the publicity, the increasing vote in the Legislature and the\r\ngeneral stirring of the suffrage question, had caused the opponents to\r\nfear that the constitutional amendment would be submitted.\r\nConsequently a bill was filed calling for another referendum like the\r\none in 1895 which would have no effect after it was taken. The\r\nExecutive Board of the State association protested against it but the\r\nsituation looked extremely dark. Levi H. Greenwood, President of the\r\nSenate, and Grafton D. Cushing, Speaker of the House, were bitter\r\nopponents of woman suffrage and on the Committee on Constitutional\r\nAmendments there was only one avowed friend, Lewis H. Sullivan of\r\nDorchester. The association's Legislative Committee worked strenuously\r\nto pledge votes against the bill. A visit to every editor in the city\r\nby Mrs. Page and Mrs. Crowley enlisted them against it and the\r\nnumerous editorials that followed were sent day by day to the\r\nlegislators: The bill's support dwindled, and on April 18 it was\r\ndefeated in the House by 117 to 73, although the Speaker left the\r\nchair for the only time that session to argue in favor of it.\r\n\r\nAt the hearing on the submission of the constitutional amendment,\r\nLouis D. Brandeis, ex-Congressman Samuel L. Powers, Joseph Walker and\r\nProfessor Albert Bushnell Hart of Harvard spoke in favor and letters\r\nwere read from Samuel W. McCall, afterwards Republican Governor;\r\nCharles Sumner Bird, the Progressive leader, and Thomas W. Riley, an\r\ninfluential Democrat. For the first time since 1895 woman suffrage\r\ncommanded a majority in the House, the vote standing ayes, 144, noes,\r\n88, but this was not the necessary two-thirds and the Legislative\r\nCommittee consented that it might be voted down in the Senate,\r\nprovided the \"straw\" vote bill was defeated at the same time.\r\n\r\nIt now seemed practically certain that the amendment would pass the\r\nnext Legislature. In the fall of 1913 the Boston Equal Suffrage\r\nAssociation defeated Walter R. Meins of the 21st Suffolk District; the\r\nLegislative Committee of the State Association defeated\r\nRepresentatives Butler of Lowell and Underhill of Somerville at the\r\nprimaries, and Bliss of Malden and Greenwood, president of the Senate,\r\nat the election. This being the first time for many years that a\r\nDemocrat had been returned from Greenwood's district, his defeat\r\ncaused a sensation.\r\n\r\nIn 1914 the Progressive party, the State Federation of Labor, the\r\nSocialists and the State Suffrage Association all introduced suffrage\r\nmeasures. The Progressive and Democratic parties had planks in their\r\nplatforms recommending the submission of the constitutional amendment\r\nto the voters and Governor Walsh was in favor of it. The suffragists\r\nwere unable to get a plank in the Republican platform. For reasons of\r\npolitical expediency, Mrs. Crowley turned over the conduct of the\r\nhearing to John Weaver Sherman, representing the State Federation of\r\nLabor. There were speeches in favor by Guy A. Ham, chairman of the\r\nResolutions Committee of the State Republican convention; Henry\r\nSterling, representing the American Federation of Labor; Mrs. William\r\nLloyd Garrison, Jr., Mrs. Pinkham and Mrs. Katherine Lent Stevenson,\r\npresident of the W. C. T. U. Letters were read from ex-Governor Bates\r\nand Sherman K. Whipple, Republican and Democratic leaders. The Women's\r\nPolitical Equality Union had speakers from the Textile Workers' Union\r\nof Boston and the unions of the telephone operators, candy-makers and\r\nstreet-car men. The debate in the House was successfully led by\r\nSanford Bates, chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Amendments.\r\nThe resolution to submit the amendment passed by 168 to 39 in the\r\nHouse and 34 to 2 in the Senate, commanding the required two-thirds\r\nfor the first time, but it had to pass a succeeding Legislature.\r\n\r\nIn 1915 the legislative work was less onerous and the amendment passed\r\nthe House by 193 to 33, the Senate by 33 to 3 and was signed by\r\nGovernor Walsh, who presented the pen to Mrs. Crowley. His signature\r\nwas not necessary but he wished to show his approval.\r\n\r\nUnder the Corrupt Practices Act a political committee, so-called, of\r\nat least five men, had to be formed to handle the funds of any group\r\nthat spent more than $20 to carry or defeat a constitutional\r\namendment. A bill was passed which allowed women to form the committee\r\nin the case of the equal suffrage amendment and the following were\r\nnamed: Miss Blackwell, chairman; Mrs. Blanche Ames, treasurer; Mrs.\r\nCrowley, Mrs. Leonard and Miss Foley. The strenuous campaign and the\r\ndefeat of the amendment after a struggle of more than half a century\r\nto have it submitted, have been described.\r\n\r\nIn 1916 no suffrage bill of any kind was presented to the Legislature\r\nby the State Association but it turned its attention to congressional\r\nwork. This was skilfully conducted by Mrs. Grace A. Johnson, chairman;\r\nmembers of Congress were interviewed, letters and telegrams sent to\r\nthe Congressional Judiciary Committee and delegates to the National\r\nparty conventions were urged to support suffrage planks. When these\r\nplanks were secured in the national platforms of all parties during\r\nthe summer the victory was celebrated with a mass meeting in Faneuil\r\nHall.\r\n\r\nIn 1917 Massachusetts held a Constitutional Convention. The Act\r\ncalling it, in describing those to whom its recommendations should be\r\nsubmitted for ratification, used the word \"people.\" A bill drawn by\r\nMrs. Crowley was filed in the Legislature by the State Suffrage\r\nAssociation asking that women be considered people within the meaning\r\nof this Act. The Senate asked the opinion of the State Supreme Court\r\nas to its constitutionality and she filed a brief. The Supreme Court\r\ndecided adversely and in view of the rapid advance of the Federal\r\nSuffrage Amendment the association decided that no State amendment\r\nshould be submitted by the convention.\r\n\r\nThe directions of the National Suffrage Association for congressional\r\nwork were carried out. Federal Amendment meetings were held, thousands\r\nof letters sent to members of Congress from their districts and about\r\n500 telegrams sent just before the vote was taken in 1918. The\r\namendment lacked but one vote of passing the U. S. Senate and it\r\nbecame necessary to defeat at least one among the anti-suffrage\r\nSenators who were coming up for re-election, so it was decided to\r\ndefeat Senator John W. Weeks in Massachusetts. His reactionary record\r\nwas spread before the Republican voters by 370,000 circulars and\r\nadvertisements in Republican papers. A special campaign among the\r\nworking men was made by members of the Women's Trade Union League,\r\nunder the leadership of Miss Mabel Gillespie, and among the Jewish\r\nvoters, who were normally Republican, under the leadership of Mrs.\r\nJoseph Fels and Mrs. Lillian E. deHaas of New York. The great\r\npopularity of President Wilson at this time was of assistance and also\r\nthat of the Democratic candidate for the Senate, ex-Governor Walsh. A\r\nspecial letter was sent to every listed member of the State\r\nassociation asking that at least one vote be secured against Mr.\r\nWeeks, with a spirited appeal by Mrs. Ames, who belonged to a\r\nprominent Republican family. Mr. Walsh was elected by about 20,000\r\nmajority, the first Democratic U. S. Senator from Massachusetts since\r\nthe Civil War.\r\n\r\nThe Congressional Committee, Mrs. Ames, chairman, sent more than 5,000\r\nletters and telegrams asking suffragists in the State to write and\r\ntelegraph the Massachusetts Senators and members of Congress to vote\r\nfor the Federal Amendment. Concentrated work was done upon three\r\ndoubtful Representatives, one of whom was secured, Carter of Needham.\r\nThis proved most fortunate as the House gave exactly the two-thirds\r\nvote.\r\n\r\nThe work done in 1918 on the great petition for the Federal Amendment\r\nwas very successful despite the influenza epidemic. In Worcester,\r\nSpringfield, Pittsfield and North Adams women signed numbering more\r\nthan 51 per cent. of the men's last vote for President and in Boston\r\n62,000 names were secured or 60 per cent. of that vote. The\r\nanti-suffragists in twenty-four years had accumulated only a little\r\nover 40,000 signatures in the whole State, according to their own\r\nfigures. In less than one year the suffragists obtained 70,792 in the\r\nabove cities and over 100,000 in the State.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. When the Federal Amendment was submitted by Congress on\r\nJune 4, 1919, the Legislative Committee of the State Association, Mrs.\r\nAnna C. M. Tillinghast, chairman, was expanded into a Ratification\r\nCommittee. It had already polled the Legislature, which was in\r\nsession. A hearing was held before the Federal Relations Committee\r\nconducted by Mrs. Tillinghast for the suffragists and by Mrs. Henry\r\nPreston White for the \"antis,\" who asked for a referendum to the\r\nvoters in place of ratification. The suffrage speakers were Frank B.\r\nHall, chairman of the Republican State Committee; Joseph Walker,\r\nProgressive Republican; Josiah Quincy, Democrat, Joseph Walsh,\r\nDemocrat, of the Senate; Mrs. Bird, Mrs. FitzGerald, Mrs. Pinkham, who\r\npresented a petition of 135,000 names from representative sections of\r\nthe Commonwealth; Mrs. Mary Thompson, representing the working women;\r\nMiss Margaret Foley, a prominent Catholic; a representative of the\r\nState W. C. T. U.; Charles J. Hodgson, legislative agent for the\r\nAmerican Federation of Labor. The speakers for the Woman's Party were\r\nMrs. Morey, Miss Betty Gram, Michael O'Leary, chairman of the\r\nDemocratic State Committee, and Mrs. Louise Sykes. On the\r\nanti-suffrage side sixteen women representing the sixteen\r\ncongressional districts told of their vote against suffrage in 1915.\r\nMiss Blackwell spoke in rebuttal for the suffragists, Miss Charlotte\r\nRowe of Yonkers, N. Y., for the \"antis.\" B. Loring Young, Republican\r\nfloor leader in the House, acted as chairman of the suffrage Steering\r\nCommittee in the House and Joseph Knox in the Senate. The committee\r\nreported in favor of ratification with two dissenting.\r\n\r\nThe debate in the House on June 25 was notable, about fifteen members\r\nspeaking on each side. An amendment calling for a referendum was\r\ndefeated by 166 to 67 and ratification carried by 185 ayes to 47\r\nnoes. The Senate ratified by 34 ayes, 5 noes. Massachusetts was the\r\neighth State to ratify. Mrs. Tillinghast expressed especial gratitude\r\nfor the assistance given by Governor Calvin Coolidge, Lieutenant\r\nGovernor Channing M. Cox, Edwin T. McKnight, President of the Senate,\r\nJoseph E. Warner, Speaker of the House, B. Loring Young, Republican,\r\nand William H. McDonnell, Democratic floor leader, Leland Powers of\r\nthe House, Joseph Knox of the Senate and the chairmen of the\r\nRepublican and Democratic State committees.\r\n\r\nAfter women had been enfranchised the State and the Boston suffrage\r\nassociations conducted citizenship schools in every county to instruct\r\nthem in their new duties.\r\n\r\nLAWS. [The very complete digest of the legislation of the past twenty\r\nyears in relation to women and children, especially to those in the\r\nindustries, prepared by Mrs. Teresa A. Crowley, attorney at law, and\r\nfilling nine typewritten pages, has to be omitted for lack of space.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[79] The History is indebted for the first part of this chapter to\r\nMiss Alice Stone Blackwell, an officer of the National American Woman\r\nSuffrage Association from 1890 to 1912 inclusive; president of the New\r\nEngland Woman Suffrage Association from 1911, and president of the\r\nMassachusetts Woman Suffrage Association almost continuously from 1909\r\nto 1920; and for the second part of the chapter to Mrs. Teresa A.\r\nCrowley, chairman of the Legislative Committee of the State\r\nassociation from 1909 for many years.\r\n\r\n[80] Later presidents were Mrs. Page, Mrs. Teresa A. Crowley, Mrs.\r\nRobert Gould Shaw and Mrs. J. Malcolm Forbes. When Mrs. Park was\r\ncalled to Washington to become national congressional chairman in 1916\r\nMrs. Wenona Osborne Pinkham succeeded her as executive secretary.\r\n\r\n[81] At the annual meeting of the M. A. O. F. E. S. W. on May 1,\r\nofficers were elected as follows: President, Mrs. G. Howland Shaw;\r\nvice-presidents, Mrs. J. H. Coolidge, Miss Anna L. Dawes, Mrs. Charles\r\nD. Homans, Miss Agnes Irwin, Mrs. Henry M. Whitney; corresponding\r\nsecretary, Miss L. C. Post; recording secretary. Miss Elizabeth\r\nJohnson; treasurer, Mrs. James M.

Hunt, Mrs. Francis C. Lowell, Mrs. J. H. Millet, Mrs. B. L.\r\nRobinson, Mrs. R. H. Saltonstall, Miss E. P. Sohier and Mrs. Henry M.\r\nThompson.\r\n\r\n[82] Additional speakers through the summer were Miss Margaret Foley,\r\nMiss Gertrude Y. Cliff, Miss Edith M. Haynes, Mrs. Marion Craig\r\nWentworth, Miss Florence Luscomb, Miss Katherine Tyng, Miss Alfretta\r\nMcClure and Miss Rosa Heinzen, the last four college girls.\r\n\r\n[83] Much help was given for years by the steady financial support of\r\nMrs. R. D. Evans, Mrs. Robert Gould Shaw and Mrs. Quincy A. Shaw. The\r\nlast named paid the rent of the suffrage headquarters during many\r\nyears and her heirs continued this assistance for some time after her\r\ndeath in 1917.\r\n\r\n[84] Many of the same persons appeared at these hearings year after\r\nyear. Among those not mentioned who spoke for suffrage between 1900\r\nand 1910 were Mrs. Lucia Ames Mead, Henry B. Blackwell, the Rev.\r\nCharles G. Ames, Mrs. Fanny B. Ames, Miss Sarah Cone Bryant, the Rev.\r\nCharles F. Dole, Mrs. Anna Christy Fall, Mrs. Helen Campbell, Miss\r\nMary Ware Allen, Miss Eva Channing, Mrs. Abby Morton Diaz, Miss\r\nLillian Freeman Clarke, Mrs. Maud Howe Elliott, Frank B. Sanborn, Mrs.\r\nEliza R. Whiting, Mrs. Mary Kenney O'Sullivan, Mrs. A. Watson Lister,\r\nof Australia; ex Governor John D. Long. Letters in favor were read\r\nfrom Professor Borden P. Bowne, of Boston University, U. S. Senator\r\nGeorge F. Hoar, ex Governor George S. Boutwell, Dr. J. L. Withrow of\r\nPark Street Church, Congressman Samuel W. McCall, Professor W. O.\r\nCrosby of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Mrs. Sarah Platt\r\nDecker, president of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, Mrs. May\r\nAlden Ward, president of the State Federation, Mrs. F. N. Shiek,\r\npresident of the Wyoming Federation, and Judge Lindsey of the Denver\r\nJuvenile Court.\r\n\r\nAmong those who spoke in opposition were Professor William T. Sedgwick\r\nof the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Mrs. Sedgwick, Mrs A.\r\nJ. George, Mrs. Barrett Wendell, Mr. and Mrs. Frank Foxcroft and Dr.\r\nLyman Abbott of New York. A number of women spoke every year who\r\nopposed the suffrage because it would take women into public life.\r\n\r\n[85] The suggestion to get out a record-breaking crowd was made by\r\nRepresentative Norman H. White of Brookline, the first man for some\r\nyears to lead a serious fight in the Legislature for woman suffrage.\r\nThe work of getting it out was engineered by Mrs. Crowley, Mrs. Page\r\nand Mrs. Mary Ware Dennett, who also arranged the great procession at\r\nthe hearing of the following year.\r\n\r\n[86] Among the speakers at the overflow meetings on the steps were the\r\nMisses Rendell and Costello, Miss Foley, Mrs. George F. Lowell, Mr.\r\nBlackwell, Mrs. Fitzgerald, John Golden and Franklin H. Wentworth. At\r\nthe overflow meeting on the Common Mrs. Fitzgerald presided and Dr.\r\nShaw was the chief speaker. A great meeting in Faneuil Hall had been\r\naddressed by Dr. Shaw and others the night before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nMICHIGAN.[87]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Michigan Equal Suffrage Association is almost as old as any in the\r\nUnited State, having been organized in January, 1870, eight months\r\nafter the National Association was formed, and its work has been long\r\nand arduous. It has had triumphs and disappointments; gained partial\r\nsuffrage at two periods and ended in a complete victory in 1918.\r\n\r\nIn 1900-1901 the principal efforts of the association, which consisted\r\nof 14 auxiliaries, were along educational lines. At the annual\r\nconvention in 1902 a petition was sent to President Theodore Roosevelt\r\nto recommend a woman suffrage amendment to the National Constitution\r\nin his message to Congress, which was heartily endorsed by the\r\nNational Grange then in session in Lansing. Little active work was\r\nbeing done with the Legislature but it is the pride of the suffragists\r\nthat no Legislature ever convened which they did not memorialize and\r\nonly two years passed without a State convention--1912, and two were\r\nheld in 1913; and 1917, when a congressional conference was held\r\ninstead.[88] The presidents during these years were Mrs. Emily Burton\r\nKetcham, Grand Rapids, 1901 (at intervals from 1892); Mrs. Martha E.\r\nSnyder Root, Bay City, 1902-3; Mrs. Guilielma H. Barnum, Charlotte,\r\n1904-6; Mrs. Clara B. Arthur, Detroit, 1906-1914; Mrs. Orton H. Clark,\r\nKalamazoo, 1914-1918; Mrs. Belle Brotherton, Detroit, acting\r\npresident, 1918; Mrs. Percy J. Farrell, Detroit, 1918-1919.\r\n\r\nFrom 1902 to 1906 the work was largely confined to the preparing of\r\npublic opinion for the probable revision of the State constitution.\r\nLegislatures refused to submit a woman suffrage amendment to the\r\nvoters on the plea that a new constitution would soon be in force. It\r\nwas decided to make an intensive educational campaign, especially\r\namong the club women. To this end suffragists served on club\r\ncommittees working for legislative or civic ends, and the rebuffs of\r\nthe measures urged by them finally resulted in the endorsement of\r\nwoman suffrage by the State Federation of Women's Clubs with 8,000\r\nmembers, at Battle Creek in October, 1908.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 speakers were sent over the State for lectures and debates.\r\nPrizes for suffrage essays were offered in high schools with material\r\nsupplied. At county and State fairs, church bazars, picnics and\r\nmeetings of various societies, literature was freely distributed. The\r\n_Woman's Journal_ was placed in all public libraries and small\r\nsuffrage tracts kept in interurban waiting rooms and in rest rooms of\r\nchurches, societies and dry-goods stores. Birthdays of pioneer\r\nsuffragists were celebrated by special meetings, local clubs always\r\nresponding to a call with so concrete an object. A committee of\r\nmembers in all parts of the State attended constantly to press work,\r\nsending in items of interest concerning the progress of women,\r\neducationally and politically, and answering attacks on woman\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\nThis year the Supreme Court decided that Mrs. Merrie Hoover Abbott,\r\nwho had been elected prosecuting attorney of Ogemaw county, could not\r\nserve because no woman was entitled to hold office. The association\r\nused this decision as a practical lesson on the position of women\r\nunder the present constitution. Finally the Legislature of 1907\r\narranged for a constitutional convention. The annual convention of the\r\nassociation promptly met the situation by appointing a Constitutional\r\nRevision Committee headed by Mrs. May Stocking Knaggs of Bay City, a\r\nformer president, and each auxiliary was invited to appoint one woman\r\nto serve on an advisory committee. The purpose of this committee was\r\nto urge upon the convention the omission of the word \"male\" from the\r\nsuffrage clause as a qualification for voting.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Elective Franchise of the constitutional convention\r\nreported unanimously in favor and on Jan 8. 1908, granted the\r\nsuffragists a hearing in Representatives Hall. Ten societies\r\ncooperating with the State suffrage association were represented--the\r\nGrange, two organizations of the Maccabees, Woman's Christian\r\nTemperance Union, State Federation of Labor, Detroit Garment Workers,\r\nState Woman's Press Association and several women's and farmers'\r\nclubs. A petition representing 225,000 names, 175,000 of individual\r\nwomen of voting age, was presented. The State president, Mrs. Clara B.\r\nArthur, introduced the speakers, Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, president of\r\nthe National American Woman Suffrage Association, and Mrs. Catharine\r\nWaugh McCulloch, a lawyer of Chicago, who made earnest addresses. The\r\nGovernor came in to hear them. The women \"antis\" circulated a leaflet\r\nopposing the change. On January 29 the debate took place in the\r\nconvention on the proposed revision, and, although not a voice had\r\nbeen raised in protest, the vote stood 38 ayes, 57 noes. Some members\r\nwho voted \"no\" did so because they believed that the whole\r\nconstitution would be defeated at the polls if it proposed to\r\nenfranchise women. The hard work of the association was not, however,\r\nbarren of results, for a clause was inserted in the new constitution\r\ngiving taxpaying women the right to vote on any public question\r\nrelating to the public expenditure of money or the issuing of bonds.\r\n[In 1915 the Legislature extended it to the granting of public\r\nfranchises.]\r\n\r\nIn the spring Mrs. Arthur with Mrs. Maud Wood Park, organizer for the\r\nNational College Suffrage League, formed branches in the colleges at\r\nAlbion, Hillsdale, Olivet and Ann Arbor and among the collegiate\r\nalumnae in Detroit, of which Dr. Mary Thompson Stevens was made\r\npresident. In June the fifty-six State delegates to the National\r\nDemocratic convention were petitioned for a woman suffrage plank in\r\nthe platform.\r\n\r\nThe next task was to try to comply with the request of the National\r\nSuffrage Association to secure 100,000 names to a nation-wide petition\r\nto be presented to Congress for a Federal Suffrage Amendment. Mrs.\r\nFern Richardson Rowe, Grand Rapids, was chairman of the work, which\r\ntook up the greater part of the year 1909 and went over into 1910.\r\nThis last year the State association obtained the consent of the Hon.\r\nLevi L. Barbour, former U. S. Senator Thomas W. Palmer and the Rev.\r\nLee S. McCollester, pastor of the Church of Our Father (Universalist),\r\nall residents of Detroit, to act as an invitational committee in\r\norganizing a Men's State League for Woman Suffrage. The charter\r\nmembership consisted of 100 influential men well known throughout the\r\nState. In March a committee of the association went to the Republican\r\nState convention to have a woman suffrage resolution adopted but were\r\nunsuccessful.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1912, the association was thrown unexpectedly into a turmoil\r\nwhen Governor Chase S. Osborn called a special session of the\r\nLegislature to consider, among other things, the submission of a woman\r\nsuffrage amendment to the State constitution to the voters at the\r\ngeneral election on November 5, urged by the Detroit branch of the\r\nCollege Suffrage League. The time was not propitious but the\r\nLegislative Committee of the association, under the direction of Mrs.\r\nJennie C. Law Hardy, went immediately to work, receiving able\r\nassistance from the Governor, the Rev. Eugene R. Shippen (Unitarian)\r\nof the Men's League and Dr. Mary Thompson Stevens of the College\r\nLeague. The State Grange immediately appropriated $1,000 for their\r\nWoman's Committee, directed by Miss Ida L. Chittenden. These united\r\nefforts were vigorously opposed by representatives of the liquor\r\ndealers but the measure passed the Senate and House. This big contest\r\nMichigan entered almost single-handed. Campaigns in other States which\r\nhad been months in progress and gave greater promise of success were\r\nengaging nearly all of the organizers and speakers from outside the\r\nState. There was less than $250 in the treasury. This amount was\r\naugmented by $1,340 from the National Association; $211 from various\r\nStates and the State Association raised $6,322. It was not until early\r\nJune that plans were completely under way. The five months remaining\r\nwere devoted to an intensive educational campaign, made possible only\r\nby the organizing work since 1906.\r\n\r\nState headquarters were opened in Detroit and subsidiary headquarters\r\nin Grand Rapids and Kalamazoo. County suffrage societies cooperated\r\nheartily and much help came from the press. The Men's League, the\r\nCollege League, the powerful State Grange, the Farmers' Clubs and\r\nmany labor organizations helped and all that was possible was done in\r\nthis short and unexpected campaign. When the returns began to come in\r\nthey were overwhelmingly in favor of the amendment. The newspapers\r\nfixed its majority at figures varying from 3,000 to 12,000.\r\nImmediately following these reports came rumors of large errors in the\r\ncount. Ballot boxes were mysteriously lost and every artifice known to\r\nthe politicians was employed to delay the official returns.\r\n\r\nGovernor Osborn was quoted in the press as follows: \"If the liquor\r\ninterests defeat the suffrage amendment by fraud, proved or suspected,\r\nthe people of Michigan will retaliate, in my opinion, by adopting\r\nstate wide prohibition. The question seems to be largely one as to\r\nwhether these interests own, control and run Michigan. Those most\r\nfeared are certain election 'crooks' in certain Detroit precincts, who\r\nwould not hesitate to do anything they thought they could get away\r\nwith.\" The Governor demanded that the returns be sent to Lansing at\r\nonce. When at the end of three weeks the official count was published\r\nit showed that the amendment had been defeated by 762 votes, ayes,\r\n247,373; noes, 248,135. Clear evidence of fraud was apparent in Wayne,\r\nKent, Saginaw and Bay counties. The State association engaged the best\r\nlegal talent and in Genesee county the courts threw out the vote on\r\nthe amendment. It developed, however, that there was no law allowing a\r\nrecount in a vote on a constitutional amendment and in the face of\r\nglaring fraud the defeat had to be accepted.\r\n\r\nNo State convention was held in November, 1912, because of the stress\r\nof campaign work but a postponed convention was held Jan. 15, 16,\r\n1913. Indignation ran high over this defeat and an immediate\r\nresubmission of the amendment was decided upon as the result of\r\nfavorable answers to questionnaires which had been sent to all county\r\nchairmen and the heads of all cooperating societies. During the\r\ncampaign no open or organized opposition among women had been in\r\nevidence. A legislative hearing was arranged by the suffragists and\r\nthe State and College League presidents on starting to Lansing found a\r\nspecial car attached to their train bearing about thirty prominent\r\nwomen members of a new Anti-Suffrage Association. Their only speaker\r\nwas Miss Minnie Bronson of New York, secretary of the National\r\nAnti-Suffrage Association. As Mrs. Arthur rose to answer her hour's\r\nspeech she remarked that for the first time the voice of a woman was\r\nheard in this State in protest against her own enfranchisement and she\r\nrejoiced that it was not the voice of a Michigan woman.\r\n\r\nDespite determined opposition the proposal passed both Houses to be\r\nvoted on at the spring election just five weeks ahead. Owing to the\r\nsocial position of the \"antis,\" the State press gave much prominence\r\nto their association, published pages of the members' pictures and\r\nquoted their reasons for organizing it. Branches were at once formed\r\nin ten adjoining towns; State offices were opened on Woodward Avenue,\r\nnear the suffrage headquarters, books opened for registration and\r\ngreat quantities of literature sent over the State. Several debates\r\nwere attempted but few materialized, as they had no home talent.[89]\r\n\r\nA placard printed in English and German and posted in saloons in\r\nvarious parts of the city by the Michigan Staatterbund announced that\r\nif the amendment should be adopted in Michigan, foreign born women\r\nwould have to take out naturalization papers at a large price. This\r\nand the Royal Ark, an association of 1,100 liquor dealers in Detroit,\r\nwere the only organizations in the State to pass resolutions against\r\nthe amendment. A Men's Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage was\r\norganized on March 15 at a meeting in the University Club; President,\r\nCharles A. Kent; vice-president, William A. Livingston, Jr.;\r\ntreasurer, Garvin Denby; secretary, Henry C. Bulkley. A well known\r\nlawyer, William E. Heinze, wrote very bitter articles for the press\r\nand undoubtedly influenced the German-American vote. The Rev. Wm.\r\nByron Forbush, pastor of the North Woodward Congregational Church,\r\nspoke at anti-suffrage meetings.\r\n\r\nOn March 29, with the election less than a week away, John Dohrinan\r\nand Senator James R. Murtha, representing Mr. Livingston, and Carl\r\nBauer of the Staatterbund appeared before the Circuit Court with a\r\npetition to have the suffrage amendment printed on a separate ballot.\r\nThe Court denied the petition. The case was immediately carried to the\r\nState Supreme Court which decided that all amendments must be on\r\nseparate ballots.\r\n\r\nNecessarily the campaign was short for the vote was to be taken April\r\n7. Unlike the one preceding, three-fourths of the financial support\r\ncame from without the State. Mrs. Ida Porter Boyer of Pennsylvania was\r\nengaged for press and executive work. The National Association\r\nfurnished speakers, among them its president, Dr. Shaw, Mrs. Carrie\r\nChapman Catt, Mrs. Park, Mrs. Celia J. White, Mrs. Susan W.\r\nFitzGerald, Mrs. Glendower Evans, Mrs. Priscilla D. Hackstaff, Mrs.\r\nElla S. Stewart, Miss Doris Stevens, Mrs. Clara Laddey, Mrs. Clara\r\nBewick Colby and Mrs. Beatrice Forbes Robertson Hale. Miss Laura Clay\r\ncame from Kentucky at her own expense. The State was organized by\r\ncounties and the speaking and circularizing were done under the\r\nimmediate direction of the county chairmen. In the report of Mrs. Edna\r\nS. Blair, chairman of organization, she stated that there were but\r\neight counties in the State which had no working committees and only\r\nthree of these were in the Lower Peninsula, their total voting\r\nstrength being less than 2,500. The amendment was defeated by 96,144,\r\nreceiving 168,738 ayes, 264,882 noes. Her analysis of the vote,\r\nprepared from county returns, showed that there was a gain of a little\r\nmore than 16,000 negative votes over those of 1912, and 13,000 of\r\nthese were in counties having a \"wet\" and \"dry\" issue.\r\n\r\nThe preceding year the liquor forces had not realized the need of\r\nactive work. Never in any other State campaign did these forces make\r\nso open a fight as in this one. They paid for columns of space in the\r\nnewspapers and circulated vast quantities of the literature prepared\r\nby the women's Anti-Suffrage Association. This was in piles on the\r\nbars of the saloons and, according to reports, in even more\r\nquestionable places. The defeat was not due so much to a change in\r\npublic opinion as it was to an absence of the favorable vote which had\r\nbeen called out in the previous year by reason of the presidential\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nAfter the election county chairmen and all suffragists were asked to\r\nurge their representatives in Congress to support the Federal\r\nAmendment. This was followed by a trip through the State by Mrs.\r\nBlair, who contributed her services, and at the convention in Jackson,\r\nin 1913, she reported that there were now only four counties, all in\r\nthe Upper Peninsula, where there was no record of active workers. Mrs.\r\nArthur was reelected.[90]\r\n\r\nAlthough recovering from two successive defeats the association found\r\nitself in 1914 able to carry on more systematic work than had ever\r\nbeen attempted. In February a monthly magazine, the _Michigan\r\nSuffragist_, was established with Mrs. Blair editor. At the convention\r\nin Traverse City Nov. 4-6, 1914, Mrs. Orton H. Clark was elected\r\npresident and the State board adopted her scheme for financing the\r\nassociation, which was successfully carried forward by the finance\r\nchairman, Mrs. J. G. Macpherson of Saginaw. It consisted in the\r\napportionment of a fixed revenue on the basis of ten cents from each\r\ntaxpaying woman, of whom there were 100,302 in the State. More than\r\none-third of the counties met all or a part of their apportionment,\r\nwhich enabled the president to open headquarters in a business\r\nbuilding in Kalamazoo, employ an executive secretary and an organizer\r\nand engage Mrs. Robertson Hale for a series of lectures.\r\n\r\nMuch of the effort during the early months of 1915 was directed toward\r\nsecuring Municipal suffrage, which necessitated active work by the\r\nLegislative Committee, Dr. Blanche M. Haines of Three Rivers,\r\nchairman. An attempt was made to organize according to congressional\r\ndistricts; chairmen were found for ten of the thirteen and a number of\r\ndistrict conferences were held. All State and national candidates were\r\ninterviewed on woman suffrage personally or by letter. Many meetings\r\nwere addressed by national and international speakers.\r\n\r\nThis program was continued through 1915 and 1916. The State\r\nconventions were held in November in Saginaw and Grand Rapids and Mrs.\r\nClark was re-elected president. Following the plan made by the\r\nNational Association, suffrage schools were held in Kalamazoo, Grand\r\nRapids and Detroit in March, 1917, with Mrs. Halsey W. Wilson, Mrs.\r\nT. T. Cotnam and Mrs. Nettie R. Shuler as instructors. Upon America's\r\nentry into the World War in April, communities, counties, the State\r\nand even the nation made demands on the association. Mrs. Clark called\r\ntogether the heads of nearly forty organizations to coordinate the war\r\nactivities of Michigan women. The Rev. Caroline Bartlett Crane was\r\nmade chairman of the State committee, which afterwards became the\r\nState Division of the Woman's Committee of the Council of National\r\nDefense, Dr. Crane chairman.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this situation, however, a bill to give a vote for\r\nPresidential electors to women was introduced in the Senate and almost\r\nsimultaneously one in the House asking for another referendum on a\r\nconstitutional amendment by Representative Flowers, who had fought the\r\nsuffrage battle for nearly a quarter of a century. The association\r\nprotested but the sponsors of both bills were adamant. As a result\r\nboth bills were passed in March and April and it found itself in the\r\nmidst of a campaign on the referendum at this most inopportune time.\r\nThere was nothing to do but to plunge into it. Interest lagged,\r\nhowever, as the women were absorbed in war work and there was a wide\r\nbelief that in recognition of this work the men would give the\r\nsuffrage without a campaign for it. Mrs. Catt, now national president,\r\ndid not share this view and she requested a conference with the State\r\nworkers. They decided to hold a State convention in Detroit, March\r\n25-27, 1918, and she and Mrs. Shuler, national chairman of\r\norganization, came to it. Mrs. Brotherton was serving as president and\r\nit was one of the largest ever held. The names of the honorary\r\ncommittee filled two pages of the program. It was welcomed by Mayor\r\nMarx and many organizations of women were represented. Mrs. Catt\r\naddressed the evening meetings and Mrs. Shuler spoke at the banquet in\r\nHotel Statler, where the convention took place.\r\n\r\nThe State Board presented a full report and program for war activities\r\nbut no plan for campaign. Most of the delegates believed the men would\r\ngive them the vote without any activity on their part. Mrs. Catt made\r\na stirring appeal in which she pointed out that war work would be\r\nexpected as their duty and that the vote would not be given as a\r\nrecognition. Before the end of the convention she had thoroughly\r\naroused the delegates and the force of her appeal was evident when the\r\ncampaign plans providing for the budget, petition and political work,\r\nwhich had been prepared by the National Association as a basis of work\r\nfor the three States then in campaign, was cheerfully adopted. The\r\nbudget called for $100,000 to be raised equally by Detroit and the\r\ncongressional districts. At the dinner on the 26th $50,000 were\r\nquickly subscribed, $24,000 by the districts. Detroit women, who had\r\nalready secured $6,000, partly to pay back debts, pledged $10,000\r\nmore. Mrs. Catt promised the equivalent of $10,000 in help from the\r\nNational Association if the full budget were raised. Mrs. Percy J.\r\nFarrell of Detroit was elected president of the association and\r\nchairman of the campaign committee and the following women were named\r\nchairmen of congressional districts; Mrs. Brotherton, Mrs. G. W.\r\nPatterson, Dr. Haines, Mrs. Huntley Russell, Mrs. Alice B. Locke, Mrs.\r\nMacpherson and Mrs. Alberta Droelle. The delegates went away from the\r\nconvention filled with enthusiasm and ready for an active campaign.\r\n\r\nPress work was again under the direction of Mrs. Boyer who was the\r\nadviser and right hand of Mrs. Farrell, giving unstintedly of her\r\nlarge experience. Mrs. Henry G. Sherrard was chairman of literature\r\nand Mrs. Myron B. Vorce of political work. Dr. Haines supervised\r\neleven counties, which gave 15,000 majority. Mrs. Boyer said of Mrs.\r\nBrotherton: \"Her faith, devotion and work extended through three\r\ncampaigns and she was one of those who could remain steadfast through\r\nthe sowing until the reaping time.\" Mrs. Russell, the State\r\nvice-president, was a recognized force. Mrs. E. L. Caulkins, president\r\nof the W. C. T. U., devoted its full organization to the amendment,\r\nespecially to the petitions and at the polls on election day. The most\r\ntelling feature of the campaign was the petition under the direction\r\nof Mrs. Emerson B. Davis of Detroit, signed by more than 202,000 women\r\nover twenty-one years old and addressed to voters, urging them to vote\r\n\"yes\" on the referendum. The work was finished in October and\r\ninteresting uses were made of the names. Those in Grand Rapids were\r\npublished in the daily papers of that city from day to day; in Saginaw\r\nthey were hung as a frieze on the walls of the woman's section at the\r\nState Fair; in other places they were exhibited in store windows. Mrs.\r\nCatt had stipulated for this petition because of its educational value\r\nand its influence on the voters and the public. The work was done by\r\nvolunteers.\r\n\r\nFew campaigns ever had so much help from organizations outside of\r\nthose for suffrage, among them were the W. C. T. U., Federation of\r\nWomen's Clubs, State Grange, State Farmers' Clubs, Gleaners, American\r\nFederation of Labor, Anti-Saloon League, and Woman's Committee of the\r\nCouncil of National Defense. The Men's League was an important factor.\r\nThe clergy almost as a unit gave generous endorsement and constant\r\nhelp. The support of the press was nearly unanimous, many papers\r\nrefusing pay for space from the \"antis.\"\r\n\r\nMost valuable assistance came from the two great fraternal insurance\r\norganizations of women, Ladies of the Maccabees and the Women's\r\nBenefit Association of the Maccabees, Miss Bina M. West supreme\r\ncommander, which had had the experience of having to defeat two\r\nreferenda aimed at crippling their form of insurance. Partly for this\r\nreason they were especially interested in securing the franchise for\r\nwomen. The Ladies of the Maccabees confined their work mainly to the\r\nwomen in their own large organization. The Women's Benefit Association\r\nassumed the responsibility of organizing six congressional districts.\r\nThey financed their own work entirely, using their own skilled\r\norganizers whenever it was necessary, especially in the Upper\r\nPeninsula, where no other workers were sent. The story of Mrs. Locke\r\nand Mrs. Droelle reads like that of the pioneers in the far western\r\ncountries. This contribution, if measured in dollars, would have\r\nrepresented many thousands.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Henry Ford, Mr. and Mrs. Willard Pope, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nGustavus Pope, Mrs. John B. Ford, Mrs. Delphine Dodge Ashbaugh and\r\nMrs. Sherrard contributed nearly half of the amount required for the\r\nentire campaign. The teachers of Detroit financed a worker for several\r\nmonths, as did the Detroit business women. Many of the larger cities\r\nfinanced their own campaigns for the last six weeks. Among the\r\nindividual men who gave great financial assistance at this time were\r\nJames Couzens, Chas. B. Warren, member of the Republican National\r\nCommittee and William A. Comstock of Alpena, who as treasurer of the\r\nMen's Suffrage League, collected the major part of their donations,\r\nnearly $9,000.\r\n\r\nThe National Suffrage Association gave in cash $1,400, paid the bill\r\nfor literature and posters, $1,335, and made other contributions\r\namounting to $6,000. It paid salaries and part of the expenses from\r\nJan. 1, 1918, of Mrs. Augusta Hughston and the organizers, Miss Lola\r\nTrax, Miss Edna Wright, Miss Marie Ames, Miss Alma Sasse and Miss\r\nStella Crossley, until the State was able to assume them. Mrs.\r\nHughston became the campaign manager of Detroit. Mrs. Shuler came\r\nthree times and campaigned all over the State. Mrs. Mary E. Craigie of\r\nNew York gave assistance. The magnitude of the detail work of the\r\ncampaign may be understood from the report of Mrs. Hughston, who said:\r\n\"In Detroit alone there were distributed 500,000 pieces of literature;\r\n50,000 buttons, 13,000 posters put in windows, 1,000 street car\r\nadvertisements, 174 large billboard posters and 1,766 inches of paid\r\nadvertisements in newspapers.\"\r\n\r\nThe election took place on Nov. 5, 1918, when the suffrage amendment\r\nreceived 229,790 ayes and 195,284 noes--carried by a majority of\r\n34,506. Four strong factors influenced the vote; first, prohibition,\r\nwhich had been adopted in 1916, was in effect and the forces that had\r\nled past opposition were badly disorganized; second, the astute\r\npoliticians saw the trend of events, and few, if any, openly opposed\r\nit; third, the war work of women, which, although it lessened the\r\nnumber of workers for suffrage, yet made forceful appeal to the\r\nvoters; fourth, the activity of all organizations of women.\r\n\r\nThis summary of the work of Michigan women for their political freedom\r\nis most incomplete without the names of hundreds of workers who\r\ntoiled, suffered, sacrificed, gave of their time, their strength,\r\ntheir money, year after year, but the list is too long. Every city,\r\nevery locality had its special difficulties, which had to be overcome\r\nand their women were equal to the task. All contributed to the great\r\nvictory. The _Woman Citizen_, official organ of the National American\r\nSuffrage Association, in its edition of Nov. 30, 1918, gave a detailed\r\nsummary of this campaign and the workers.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief respite, the suffragists took up the work of a\r\nregistration \"drive\" for the spring election in April, when an\r\namendment to weaken the prohibition law was to be voted on. The\r\nregistration by women in some places was larger than that of men.\r\nProhibition had been carried in 1916 by a majority of 68,624. At this\r\nelection in 1919, with women voting, the majority was over three times\r\nas large--207,520--and the amendment was defeated.\r\n\r\nThe convention of the State Equal Suffrage Association met in Grand\r\nRapids, April 3, 4, 1919, Mrs. Farrell presiding. The name was changed\r\nto the State League of Women Voters and Mrs. Brotherton was elected\r\nchairman. Plans for the approaching ratification campaign were made\r\nand she was authorized to secure chairmen for the new departments of\r\nwork. The willingness of women to accept the various chairmanships was\r\nin marked contrast to the difficulties encountered during suffrage\r\ncampaigns.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. The Federal Suffrage Amendment was submitted by Congress\r\nJune 4, 1919, and fortunately Governor Albert E. Sleeper had called a\r\nspecial session of the Legislature to convene on June 3. He was at\r\nonce requested to submit the amendment for ratification and soon\r\nannounced his willingness to do so. A recess had been taken over\r\nSunday but each member received a letter from the League of Women\r\nVoters asking for a favorable vote and many cordial answers were\r\nreceived. The Legislature assembled at 2 o'clock on Tuesday, June 10.\r\nThe Senate and House at once voted unanimously in favor of\r\nratification. The same day the Wisconsin and Illinois Legislatures\r\nalso ratified. These three States were the first to take action.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. 1903. A joint resolution to amend the State\r\nconstitution by striking out the word \"male\" as a qualification for\r\nvoters was introduced by Representative Nathan A. Lovell but was not\r\nreported out of the committees.\r\n\r\n1905. A similar resolution was introduced by Representative George E.\r\nDewey but failed to pass by seven votes.\r\n\r\n1911. The same resolution received in the House 55 ayes, 44 noes,\r\nlacking the necessary two-thirds, and failed in the Senate by two\r\nvotes.\r\n\r\n1912. In the call for a special session Governor Osborn included the\r\nconsideration of a woman suffrage amendment. It was introduced in the\r\nSenate by Robert Y. Ogg and in the House by Representative Charles\r\nFlowers. The Senate opposition was led by James A. Murtha and Charles\r\nM. Culver, while William M. Martz sought to block it in the House. The\r\nvote in the Senate was 23 ayes, 5 noes; in the House 75 ayes, 19 noes.\r\nIt was submitted to the voters and defeated.\r\n\r\n1913. A hearing on the amendment resolution was arranged by the State\r\nboard in February. Without the knowledge of the suffragists the\r\n\"antis\" secured one to precede theirs. The president, Mrs. Arthur, Dr.\r\nMary Thompson Stevens, Dr. Caroline Bartlett Crane and Mrs. Jennie C.\r\nLaw Hardy spoke for the amendment. The vote in the Senate was 24 ayes,\r\n5 noes; in the House, 73 ayes, 19 noes. Submitted and defeated at the\r\npolls.\r\n\r\n1915. The bill for Municipal suffrage was rejected as\r\nunconstitutional.\r\n\r\n1917. Two measures were introduced, one for the amendment by\r\nRepresentative Flower and the other for Presidential suffrage by\r\nSenator John M. Damon of Mt. Pleasant. At last the officers of the\r\nState Association had to withdraw their opposition to the referendum\r\nin order to save the Presidential bill. The vote on the referendum\r\nMarch 28 was, House 71 ayes, 21 noes; April 19, Senate, 26 ayes, 4\r\nnoes; a two-thirds vote required. The Presidential suffrage vote on\r\nMarch 21 in the Senate was 22 ayes, 7 noes; on April 18 in the House,\r\n64 ayes, 30 noes. There was no strong opposition. The amendment was\r\ncarried by a large majority on Nov. 5, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[87] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Clara B. Arthur,\r\nvice-president of the State Equal Suffrage Association 1895-1906;\r\npresident, 1906-1914, and Mrs. Belle Brotherton, acting president,\r\n1918; chairman of the League of Women Voters, 1919.\r\n\r\n[88] Following are the times and places of holding State conventions:\r\nOct. 23-25, 1901, Saginaw; Oct. 29-31, 1902, Charlotte; Nov. 10-12,\r\n1903, Paw Paw; Oct. 25-27, 1904, Jackson; Nov. 1-3, 1905, Port Huron;\r\nOct. 9, 10, 1906, Kalamazoo; Sept. 18-20, 1907, Charlotte; Nov. 5, 6,\r\n1908, Bay City; Dec. 7, 8, 1909, Grand Rapids; Nov. 6-8, 1910,\r\nKalamazoo; Nov. 16, 17, 1911, Kalamazoo; no convention in 1912; Jan.\r\n15, 16, 1913, Lansing; Nov. 5-7, 1913, Jackson; Nov. 4-6, 1914,\r\nTraverse City; Nov. 10, 11, 1915, Saginaw; Nov. 15-17, 1916, Grand\r\nRapids; no convention in 1917; March 26, 27, 1918, Detroit; April 3,\r\n4, 1919, Grand Rapids.\r\n\r\n[89] The officers of the Association Opposed to Equal Suffrage as\r\npublished in the press were: President, Mrs. Henry F. Lyster;\r\nsecretary, Miss Helen Keep; publicity committee, Miss Julia Russell,\r\nMrs. A. A. Griffiths, Mrs. J. A. McMillan, Mrs. Fred Reynolds, Mrs.\r\nEdward H. Parker, Mrs. Richard Jackson and Miss Caroline Barnard.\r\n\r\n[90] Mrs. Brotherton writes: \"Special tribute should be paid to the\r\nsplendid administrative ability of Mrs. Arthur. Her conduct of the\r\n1912 and 1913 campaigns and the years of effort that preceded them\r\ndeserve the unending gratitude of Michigan women. Her greatest\r\nmonument was the vote of taxpaying women on bond issues. Mrs. Orton H.\r\nClark, who succeeded Mrs. Arthur in 1914, brought to the work the same\r\npatient and consecrated zeal and to her is largely due the gaining of\r\nPresidential suffrage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nMINNESOTA.[91]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great event for the Minnesota Woman Suffrage Association in 1901\r\nwas the convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association\r\nMay 30-June 5 in Minneapolis. Large audiences night after night filled\r\nthe First Baptist Church to listen to the eloquent addresses of Miss\r\nSusan B. Anthony, honorary president; Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,\r\npresident, and Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, vice-president of the\r\nassociation; Henry B. Blackwell, editor of the _Woman's Journal_,\r\nRachel Foster Avery and other speakers of national fame. The officers\r\nwere entertained at West Hotel and the 200 delegates in the homes of\r\nsuffragists. Dr. Cora Smith Eaton, who was the chairman of\r\narrangements, was elected second auditor of the National Association.\r\n\r\nThe State convention of 1901 was held in Mankato in October, with Mrs.\r\nCatt as the principal speaker. Mrs. Maud C. Stockwell and Mrs. Jennie\r\nKnight Brown were re-elected president and vice-president and Mrs. A.\r\nH. Boostrom appointed chairman of press. Through the generosity of\r\nMrs. E. A. Russell of Minneapolis Miss Anna Gjertsen was engaged to\r\norganize the Scandinavian women. Among the names enrolled in the\r\nsuffrage booth at the State Fair were those of Theodore Roosevelt,\r\nVice-President of the United States; Gen. Nelson Miles, Gov. Samuel R.\r\nVan Sant and Archbishop Ireland. The annual convention of 1902 was\r\nentertained in June by the St. Paul Club, which had been organized a\r\nfew months before. Mrs. Hannah Egelston was elected vice-president.\r\nThe press chairman stated that fifteen newspapers were using suffrage\r\narticles and the enrollment and the petition work for Presidential\r\nsuffrage was being successfully carried on. The association was\r\nincorporated this year.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1903, the State convention was held in Austin with Dr.\r\nShaw the chief speaker. The former officers were re-elected. Reports\r\nshowed old clubs revived and new ones formed through the efforts of\r\nMiss Gail Laughlin, one of the national organizers. Mrs. Eugenia B.\r\nFarmer was this year appointed chairman of press and held the office\r\ntill 1915 when she was made honorary chairman. She did not relinquish\r\nthe work but continued to assist her successor, Mrs. W. H. Thorp. For\r\neight years Mrs. Farmer kept press headquarters in the Old Capitol,\r\nSt. Paul. She added new papers to the list which accepted suffrage\r\nmatter till it had 500, about all of them, and much of the suffrage\r\nsentiment in the State can be traced to her years of work. The\r\nquarterly bulletin was edited by Mrs. Julia B. Nelson.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1904, the convention met in Anoka and Dr. Shaw addressed\r\nlarge audiences. Miss Marion Sloan of Rochester was made\r\nvice-president. During the year the association offered prizes for the\r\nbest essay on woman suffrage to the students of the four Normal\r\nSchools, many competing. The annual meeting for 1905 was held in\r\nMinneapolis in November. In answer to the many calls a Lecture Bureau\r\nof twenty well-known speakers directed by Dr. Annah Hurd had been\r\norganized; a generous contribution was sent to Oregon for its\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1906, an impressive memorial service was held in Minneapolis\r\nfor the beloved leader, Susan B. Anthony. Another was held in\r\nMonticello in November during the State convention. It was reported\r\nthat the Governor had appointed Dr. Margaret Koch, one of the active\r\nsuffragists, to the State Medical Board; that many organizations had\r\npassed resolutions endorsing suffrage and that in June Mrs. Stockwell\r\nhad presented the greetings of the National Association to the General\r\nFederation of Women's Clubs in convention in St. Paul. In October,\r\n1907, the convention met in Austin. During the year a Scandinavian\r\nassociation had been formed by Dr. Ethel E. Hurd, with Mrs. Jenova\r\nMartin president, and a College Equal Suffrage League at the State\r\nUniversity by Professors Frances Squire Potter and Mary Gray Peck,\r\nwith Miss Elsa Ueland president. Miss Laura Gregg, sent by the\r\nNational Association, had organized suffrage committees in twelve\r\ntowns. It was decided to circularize the teachers of the State.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1908, the convention was held in Minneapolis with Dr.\r\nShaw and Professor Potter as speakers. Mrs. Martin was elected\r\nvice-president. The energy of all suffrage workers had been turned\r\ntoward the great petition to Congress for the Federal Amendment\r\nplanned by the National Association and directed in the State by Mrs.\r\nF. G. Corser of Minneapolis. Mrs. Maud Wood Park made a tour of the\r\nState in March speaking in eight colleges in the interest of the\r\nNational College Equal Suffrage League. In October, 1909, the State\r\nconvention went to St. Paul. The _Bulletin_, official organ of the\r\nassociation and a valuable feature of its work, had had to be\r\nabandoned because of lack of funds. It had been edited for ten years\r\nby Dr. Ethel E. Hurd, recording secretary, who sometimes mimeographed\r\nit herself, sometimes had it typewritten and when possible printed,\r\nalways herself addressing and mailing copies to the State members. An\r\nimportant event of the year was the unanimous endorsement of woman\r\nsuffrage by the State Editorial Association, secured by Miss Mary\r\nMcFadden, a journalist. For the first time a speaker was supplied to\r\nthe State convention of the Federation of Women's Clubs.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1910, the State convention was entertained by the\r\nMinneapolis Political Equality Club, organized in 1868. Mrs.\r\nStockwell, who had served as president for ten years, asked to be\r\nrelieved from office and Miss Emily Dobbyn of St. Paul was elected\r\npresident with Dr. Margaret Koch, who had been treasurer ten years,\r\nfirst vice-president. The petition was reported as finished with\r\n20,300 names. It was sent to Washington and presented to Congress by\r\nSenator Moses E. Clapp with an earnest plea for its consideration. In\r\nOctober, 1911, the convention again went to St. Paul and Mrs. A. T.\r\nHall of this city was elected president.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1912 was held in Minneapolis in September. Under\r\ndirection of Mrs. A. H. Bright of this city the first automobile\r\nsuffrage parade took place, the route extending from the court house\r\nwhere the convention was held to the Fair grounds where addresses were\r\nmade. Eleven new clubs were reported. The Woman's Welfare League of\r\nSt. Paul joined the State association and did excellent work for\r\nsuffrage. Mrs. Hall was re-elected president and removing from the\r\nState later Mrs. P. L. De Voist of Duluth was selected to fill out her\r\nterm.[92]\r\n\r\nIn October, 1913, at the annual convention in St. Paul, Mrs. Bright\r\nwas elected president. The Minneapolis Equal Suffrage Club, which had\r\nbeen organized independently by Mrs. Andreas Ueland, joined the State\r\nassociation and later became the Hennepin County suffrage\r\norganization. A Women Workers' Suffrage Club was formed with Mrs.\r\nGertrude Hunter, president.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1914, at the convention in Minneapolis, Mrs. Ueland was\r\nelected president and served for the next five years.[93] It was\r\nreported that the Everywoman Suffrage Club of colored women had been\r\norganized in St. Paul with Mrs. W. T. Francis president. The clubs of\r\nSt. Paul and Minneapolis, at the request of the National Association,\r\nhad joined in the nation-wide demonstration May 2 with mass meetings\r\nin each city, a street meeting and parade in St. Paul at noon and a\r\njoint parade in Minneapolis in the afternoon with 2,000 men and women\r\nin line.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1915, the convention took place in St. Paul. Up to this\r\ntime headquarters had been maintained free of charge in Minneapolis,\r\nat first in the office of Drs. Cora Smith Eaton and Margaret Koch and\r\nfor many years in the office of Drs. Ethel E. and Annah Hurd. This\r\nyear they were opened in the Essex Building of that city and a paid\r\nsecretary installed. Organization by districts was arranged for. In\r\nconformity with plans sent out from the National Association,\r\nquarterly conferences were held in different sections of the State.\r\n\"Organization day\" on February 15, Miss Anthony's birthday, was\r\ncelebrated in fifteen legislative districts with meetings and\r\npageants. During the national convention in Washington this year\r\ndeputations of suffragists from Minnesota called on the State's two\r\nSenators and ten Representatives asking them to promote the Federal\r\nSuffrage Amendment. To assist the campaign the services of the State\r\norganizer, Mrs. Maria McMahon, were given to New York for September\r\nand October; Mrs. David F. Simpson and Miss Florence Monahan\r\ncontributed their services as speakers and $400 were sent to the New\r\nJersey campaign.[94]\r\n\r\nIn October, 1916, at the convention in Minneapolis, a delightful\r\nfeature was a banquet of 500 covers at the Hotel Radisson, where\r\nPresident George E. Vincent of the State University made his maiden\r\nspeech for woman suffrage. Mrs. Simpson presided. There were favorable\r\nreports from officers, committee chairmen and organizers. At the\r\nrequest of the National Association deputations had called upon the\r\nState delegates to the national Republican and Democratic conventions\r\nurging them to work for suffrage planks in their party platforms.\r\nTwenty-five Minnesota women marched in the parade in Chicago at the\r\ntime of the Republican National Convention and many went to the\r\nNational Democratic Convention in St. Louis on a \"suffrage barge,\"\r\nholding meetings on the boat and at a number of stopping places. In\r\nMay the Mississippi Valley Suffrage Conference was entertained in\r\nMinneapolis and a mass meeting of 2,000 was held. Automobile speaking\r\ntrips were made. Money, organizers and speakers were contributed to\r\nthe Iowa campaign.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1917, the convention again met in Minneapolis with Mrs.\r\nNellie McClung of Edmonton, Alberta, as speaker. Pledges were made of\r\n$8,000 for State work and $3,000 to the National Association as the\r\nState's apportionment. In order to push Federal Amendment work\r\nchairmen were secured for the ten congressional districts. Resolutions\r\nfor it were passed at many conventions. In May Dr. Effie McCollum\r\nJones of Iowa had made a lecture tour of the State, contributed by the\r\nNational Association, and addressed 10,000 people. An attractive\r\nconcrete building had been erected on the State Fair grounds by the\r\nScandinavian Association and presented to the State association.[95]\r\nThis was known as the Woman Citizen Building and a tablet was placed\r\nin it in memory of Mrs. Julia B. Nelson, one of Minnesota's staunchest\r\npioneer suffragists.\r\n\r\nOwing to the influenza epidemic all meetings were forbidden in 1918.\r\nThis year district organization was completed. With three organizers\r\nin the field, Mrs. Rene F. Stevens, Mrs. James Forrestal and Mrs. John\r\nA. Guise, ratification committees in 480 towns outside of the three\r\nlarge cities had been appointed and 90,000 signatures obtained for the\r\nnational petition under the leadership of Miss Marguerite M. Wells. In\r\nMarch the following plank had appeared in the platform of the\r\nDemocratic Statewide Conference held in St. Paul: \"We believe in the\r\nprinciple of State woman suffrage as supported and commended by our\r\nleader, Woodrow Wilson.\" This was the only official Democratic\r\nendorsement ever received and there was none from the Republicans.[96]\r\n\r\nA State conference was held at Minneapolis in May, 1919, with Mrs.\r\nMcClung as the principal speaker. On June 9 in the rotunda of the\r\nCapitol at St. Paul an impressive program of addresses and ringing\r\nresolutions was given, 3,000 people taking part in this celebration of\r\nthe submission of the Federal Suffrage Amendment by Congress on the\r\n4th. A. L. Searle marshalled the 250 gaily decorated automobiles\r\ncarrying the Minneapolis delegates, accompanied by a band.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. Monday, September 8, was a beautiful and spirited\r\noccasion. Automobile parades assembled in the two cities and started\r\nfor the Capitol with cars gay with sunflowers, goldenrod, yellow\r\nbunting and the word \"suffrage\" on the windshields. By 10 o'clock the\r\ngalleries and the corridors were filled to overflowing with\r\nenthusiastic suffragists. Out-of-town women flocked in to join the\r\nfestivities. The Federal Amendment came up immediately after the\r\norganization of both Houses in special session but the lower House won\r\nthe race for the honor of being first to ratify, for it took up the\r\namendment without even waiting for Governor Burnquist's message, and\r\nwhen it was presented by Representative Theodore Christiansen it was\r\nratified by a vote of 120 to 6. The Senate considered it immediately\r\nafter hearing the Governor's message. It was presented by Senator Ole\r\nSageng, called the \"father of woman suffrage\" in Minnesota, and with\r\nno debate went through by 60 to 5.\r\n\r\nThe moment the Senate vote was polled the corridors, floors and\r\ngalleries of both Houses were in an uproar, hundreds of women cheered\r\nand laughed and waved the suffrage colors, while in the rotunda a band\r\nswung into the strains of the \"Battle Hymn of the Republic.\" Then\r\nRepresentatives and Senators became the guests of the State Suffrage\r\nAssociation, whose members having leased the Capitol restaurant for\r\nthe day cooked and served an appetizing chicken dinner. There was a\r\nbanquet at the St. Paul Hotel in the evening with 400 guests.\r\n\r\nOn that memorable day the curtain was rung down on the last act of the\r\nmany years' long drama participated in by a vast host of consecrated\r\nwomen with inspired faith in the ultimate attainment of justice.\r\n\r\nA conference was called for Oct. 28, 29, 1919, in Minneapolis and a\r\nState League of Women Voters was formed with Mrs. Ueland as chairman.\r\nIt was voted to delay the dissolution of the State association until\r\nthe 36 States had ratified the Federal Amendment and the date was set\r\nat the first annual meeting of the League.[97] Mrs. Ueland soon\r\nresigned to take the chairmanship of the Legislative Committee and\r\nwas succeeded by Miss Wells, the vice-chairman.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. 1903. A Presidential suffrage bill was introduced\r\nin the House and energetically pushed but was not reported by the\r\nJudiciary Committee.\r\n\r\n1905. A large delegation headed by Mrs. Stockwell, State president,\r\ncalled on Governor John A. Johnson and urged him to recommend woman\r\nsuffrage in his message to the Legislature but he failed to do so. The\r\nresolution to submit a constitutional amendment was introduced in the\r\nHouse but not reported by the Judiciary Committee.\r\n\r\n1907. After the resolution for a suffrage amendment was presented a\r\nhearing was granted by the Senate Elections Committee and the Senate\r\nChamber secured for it through Senator Virgil B. Seward, who had\r\ncharge of it. The college women were represented by Professor Frances\r\nSquire Potter of the University of Minnesota and the committee\r\nreported favorably. It was defeated in the Senate and not brought up\r\nin the House.\r\n\r\n1909. At the hearing before the Joint Committee on Elections on the\r\nresolution for a State amendment, which was the largest ever held by\r\nthe association, convincing addresses were made by eminent lawyers,\r\neducators and other public men. It was defeated in the Senate by a\r\nvote of 30 to 26; in the House by 50 to 46.\r\n\r\n1911. The chairman of the Legislative Committee was Miss Mary\r\nMcFadden, who carried out a demonstration on Susan B. Anthony's\r\nbirthday--February 15--the presenting by large delegations from the\r\nTwin Cities of a Memorial to a joint gathering of the two Houses with\r\npleas for a State amendment. The resolution for it, sponsored by Ole\r\nSageng, passed the House a few days later by a majority of 81 but the\r\nliquor interests and public service corporations defeated it in the\r\nSenate by two votes.\r\n\r\n1913. Senator Sageng again had charge of the suffrage resolution,\r\nwhich passed the House by a majority of 43 votes but failed in the\r\nSenate by three.\r\n\r\n1915. Mrs. Andreas Ueland was chairman of the Legislative Committee\r\nfrom 1915 to 1919 inclusive. Senator Sageng presented the amendment\r\nresolution in the Senate and Representative Larson in the House. An\r\nimpressive hearing was held in a crowded Senate chamber, with Senators\r\nJ. W. Andrews, Richard Jones, Frank E. Putnam, F. H. Peterson and Ole\r\nSageng making speeches in favor. Those who spoke against it were\r\nSenators George H. Sullivan, F. A. Duxbury and F. H. Pauly.[98] It\r\nfailed by one vote and was not brought up in the House. A Presidential\r\nsuffrage bill was also introduced but did not come to a vote.\r\n\r\n1917. The suffrage work was confined to the Presidential suffrage bill\r\nwhich was defeated in the Senate by two votes.\r\n\r\n1919. This Legislature adopted a resolution calling upon Congress to\r\nsubmit the Federal Suffrage Amendment; House 100 to 28 in favor,\r\nSenate 49 to 7. It was decided not to introduce an amendment\r\nresolution but to work for Presidential suffrage. The resolution was\r\nintroduced, however, by a small group of women outside the\r\nassociation. It passed the House by 96 ayes, 26 noes, but was\r\nindefinitely postponed in the Senate. The bill giving women the right\r\nto vote for Presidential electors passed the House March 5 by 103\r\nayes, 24 noes; and the Senate March 21 by 49 ayes, 11 noes. It was\r\nsigned by Governor J. A. A. Burnquist two days later in the presence\r\nof a group of suffragists.[99]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[91] The History is indebted for this chapter to Maud C. (Mrs. S. A.)\r\nStockwell, for ten years president of the State Suffrage Association\r\nand for over twenty years a member of its executive board. Mrs.\r\nStockwell wishes to acknowledge assistance from Mrs. David F. Simpson\r\nand Mrs. John A. Guise.\r\n\r\n[92] A State Anti-Suffrage Association was organized in Minneapolis in\r\n1912 and later branches were formed in other cities. The president was\r\nMrs. J. B. Gilfillan of Minneapolis and other active workers were Mrs.\r\nE. L. Carpenter, Mrs. Edmund Pennington and Mrs. Frank Reed of\r\nMinneapolis, Mrs. J. W. Straight of St. Paul and Mrs. J. L. Washburn\r\nof Duluth. Time was given to their speakers at the last three hearings\r\ngranted the State Suffrage Association by the Legislature. Miss Minnie\r\nBronson, secretary of the National Anti-Suffrage Association, came\r\nfrom New York for one.\r\n\r\n[93] Too much credit for the final success of woman suffrage in\r\nMinnesota can not be given to Mrs. Ueland, president of the\r\nassociation for the last five years of its existence. She organized\r\nthe entire State, raised large sums of money each year, induced many\r\nprominent women to join in the work, carried out the instructions of\r\nthe National Association to the letter, secured legislation, and not\r\nonly took advantage of every opportunity for propaganda but created\r\nopportunities.\r\n\r\n[94] In 1915 the Congressional Union, afterward the National Woman's\r\nParty, formed an organization in St. Paul with Mrs. Alexander Colvin\r\nchairman. The members were recruited from the State association and\r\nfor a few years were active in both organizations.\r\n\r\n[95] During the twenty years covered by this chapter the Twin City\r\nsuffragists never failed to keep open house during the State Fair,\r\nwhere speakers were heard and literature was distributed.\r\n\r\n[96] Following are the names of State officers besides the presidents\r\nwho served over three years: Vice-presidents, Mrs. Jenova Martin, four\r\nyears; Mrs. David F. Simpson, three years; Mrs. H. G. Harrison, five\r\nyears; Mrs. E. A. Brown, four years; Mrs. C. L. Atwood, six years; Dr.\r\nMargaret Koch, vice-president, three years and treasurer, ten years;\r\nDr. Ethel E. Hurd of Minneapolis served on the board in different\r\ncapacities for twenty-two years, as corresponding secretary for four\r\nyears and recording secretary four; Mrs. Eva W. Morse, recording\r\nsecretary five years; Mrs. Victor H. Troendle, treasurer five years.\r\nThose who served from four to ten years as directors on the State\r\nboard were: Mesdames A. T. Anderson, Julia B. Nelson, Margaret K.\r\nRogers, E. A. Russell, C. F. Lutz, Elizabeth McClary, A. H. Bright and\r\nA. B. Jackson.\r\n\r\n[97] Following are a few names not mentioned elsewhere in the chapter\r\nof the many devoted friends and workers during the score of years: Dr.\r\nCyrus Northrup, Professor Maria Sanford, Judge A. C. Hickman,\r\nProfessor A. W. Rankin, Dr. Elizabeth Woodworth, Mesdames Margaret K.\r\nRogers, Martha A. Dorsett, May Dudley Greeley, M. A. Luley, Eva S.\r\nJerome, Alice Taylor, Lilla P. Clark, Milton E. Purdy, C. P. Noyes,\r\nAdelaide Lawrence, O. J. Evans, George M. Partridge, J. W. Andrews, C.\r\nM. Stockton, Stiles Burr, J. M. Guise, J. W. Straight; Misses Ella\r\nWhitney, A. A. Connor, Nellie Merrill, Hope McDonald, Josephine\r\nSchain, Blanche Segar, Cornelia Lusk, Martha Anderson (Wyman); Messrs.\r\nC. W. Dorsett, S. R. Child, A. H. Bright.\r\n\r\n[98] For ten years Senator Sullivan of Stillwater, and for twenty-two\r\nyears Senator W. W. Dunn, attorney for the Hamm Brewing Company of St.\r\nPaul, worked actively against all suffrage legislation, in late years\r\nbeing able to defeat bills by only two or three votes.\r\n\r\n[99] Among legislators not mentioned who were helpful during these\r\nyears were Senator S. A. Stockwell and Representatives W. I. Norton,\r\nH. H. Harrison, W. I. Nolan, Sherman Child, John Sanborn and Claude\r\nSouthwick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nMISSISSIPPI.[100]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom 1899 to 1906 no State convention of the Mississippi Woman\r\nSuffrage Association was held. Mrs. Hala Hammond Butt, who was elected\r\npresident at its second annual convention in Clarksdale in 1899, acted\r\nas president during this time but the editing of a weekly newspaper in\r\naddition to other duties left her little time for its trying demands\r\nat this early stage of its existence. Among the few other women\r\nconsecrated in their hearts to woman suffrage some were barred from\r\nleadership by ill health, some by family cares, while others were\r\nabsent from the State most of the time. No definite progress,\r\ntherefore, was made during the early years of the century.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, president of the National American\r\nWoman Suffrage Association, gave addresses in six cities in the State,\r\narrangements for which were made by local suffragists, and a great\r\ndeal of interest was aroused. In 1903 a business conference was held\r\nin Jackson, at which Mrs. Butt and three other women were present, to\r\nconsider whether anything could be done for the cause of woman\r\nsuffrage. In 1904 enrollment cards were distributed in a limited and\r\nunsystematic way, letters were sent to members of the Legislature,\r\nState officials and others and literature was distributed. An\r\ninspiring feature was the visit of Dr. Anna Howard Shaw,\r\nvice-president at large of the National Association, who spoke in\r\nthree cities.\r\n\r\nEarly in December, 1906, Miss Belle Kearney of Flora, formerly\r\norganizer for the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, at this time a\r\npublic lecturer, returned from an absence in Europe and on the 21st,\r\nin response to a call sent out by her, a meeting was held in the\r\nparlor of the Edwards House in Jackson. Those in attendance were Miss\r\nKearney, Mrs. Butt, Mrs. Edward Sloan and Dr. Delia Randall. By\r\ninvitation Dr. William La Prade of the First Methodist Church opened\r\nthe meeting with prayer, after which he retired leaving these four\r\nwomen to reorganize the State Suffrage Association. Mrs. Nellie Nugent\r\nSomerville of Greenville was in touch with the conference by telegraph\r\nand Mrs. Lily Wilkinson Thompson of Jackson, physically unable to\r\nattend, received reports from the meeting at her telephone. In this\r\nhistoric hour the breath of a new life was blown into the expiring\r\nassociation and from that time it grew and thrived. The officers\r\nelected were Miss Kearney, president; Mrs. Somerville, vice-president;\r\nMrs. Thompson, treasurer.\r\n\r\nDuring the following spring Miss Kearney, lecturing in the State on\r\nsociological subjects, spoke unfailingly for suffrage and wherever\r\npossible organized clubs. Press work was taken up earnestly by the\r\nnewly elected superintendent of that department, Mrs. Thompson. All of\r\nthe over two hundred editors in the State were interviewed by letter\r\nin regard to their attitude towards woman suffrage and space was\r\nrequested for suffrage items. Twenty-one agreed to publish them, only\r\ntwo openly declining. Among the friendly editors were L. Pink Smith of\r\nthe Greenville _Democrat_, J. R. Oliphant of the Poplarville _Free\r\nPress_, Frank R. Birdsall of the Yazoo _Sentinel_, C. E. Glassco of\r\nthe Cleveland _Enterprise_, Joseph Norwood of the Magnolia _Gazette_,\r\nJames Faulk of the Greene County _Herald_.\r\n\r\nAdverse articles were carefully answered and private letters were\r\nsent, the enemy quietly reasoned with and in most cases converted.\r\nNews bulletins furnished by the national press department were used\r\nbut most of the matter sent out was prepared at home in the belief\r\nthat an ounce of Mississippi was worth a pound of Massachusetts.\r\nArticles published in leaflet form and distributed broadcast were\r\nwritten by Mrs. Somerville, Miss Kearney, Mrs. Thompson, the Rev.\r\nThomas K. Mellen and the Rev. H. Walter Featherstun, Methodist\r\nministers. One of the most valuable contributions was The Legal Status\r\nof Mississippi Women, by Robert Campbell, an attorney of Greenville.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1907, a conference lasting five days was held at Jackson\r\nin the home of Charles H. Thompson, a devoted suffragist, and his\r\nwife, Lily Wilkinson Thompson. Among those attending were Miss\r\nKearney, Mrs. Somerville, Mrs. Harriet B. Kells, president of the\r\nState W. C. T. U. and a life-long suffragist; Miss Laura Clay of\r\nKentucky and Miss Kate Gordon of Louisiana. The advisability of\r\nattempting to have a woman suffrage measure introduced in the next\r\nsession of the Legislature was considered. Two men besides the host\r\nappeared at this conference, a reporter, who regarded the meeting as\r\nsomething of a joke, and the Hon. R. H. Thompson of Jackson, an\r\neminent lawyer, who came to offer sympathetic advice. Visits were made\r\nto the Governor, James K. Vardaman, and other State officials; to the\r\nHinds county legislators who had recently been elected and to others.\r\nMost of these gentlemen were polite but bored and it was decided to\r\ndefer legislative action. When two months later Governor Vardaman sent\r\nhis farewell message to the Legislature he mentioned woman suffrage as\r\none of the questions \"pressing for solution in a National\r\nConstitutional Convention.\"\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1908 the State convention was held in the Governor's\r\nMansion at Jackson, Governor and Mrs. Edmund Favor Noel giving the\r\nparlors for the meeting. Six clubs were reported and State members at\r\ntwelve places. Three or four women from outside of Jackson were\r\npresent, Mrs. Pauline Alston Clark of Clarksdale having come from the\r\ngreatest distance, and about fourteen were in attendance. The officers\r\nelected were: President, Mrs. Somerville; vice-presidents, Mrs.\r\nThompson, Mrs. Fannie Clark, Mrs. Kells; corresponding secretary, Mrs.\r\nPauline Clark; recording secretary, Dr. Randall; treasurer, Mrs. Sarah\r\nSummers Wilkinson. Superintendents were appointed for Press,\r\nLegislative, Enrollment, Industrial, Educational and Bible Study\r\ndepartments.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1909, the convention was held in the ladies' parlor\r\nof the Capitol at Jackson. It lasted two days, a public evening\r\nsession being held in the Senate Chamber, at which Miss Kate Gordon,\r\ncorresponding secretary of the National American Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation, told of the work of the Era Club of New Orleans; Miss\r\nJean Gordon, factory inspector for that city, spoke in behalf of child\r\nlabor regulations and Mrs. Thompson gave a report of the press work,\r\nwhich had grown to such proportions that it was considered very\r\nsignificant of advance in suffrage sentiment throughout the State.\r\nThe Rev. George Whitfield, a venerable Baptist minister, came from the\r\nneighboring town of Clinton and conducted devotional exercises and\r\ngave a talk on woman's position from a Biblical standpoint. R. K.\r\nJayne of Jackson, an early suffragist, also spoke. At this time\r\ndues-paying members were reported from seventeen towns. Mrs.\r\nSomerville was re-elected president.\r\n\r\nThe annual convention was held in Greenville in 1910. Dr. Shaw and\r\nMiss Ray Costello of England made addresses; Judge E. N. Thomas of\r\nGreenville presided at one of the evening meetings; John L. Hebron, a\r\nDelta planter and afterwards State Senator, made an earnest speech of\r\nendorsement. It was reported that hundreds of letters were written and\r\nthe association had gained a hold in fifty places, ranging from rural\r\nneighborhoods and plantation settlements to the largest towns.\r\nFrederick Sullens, editor of the Jackson _Daily News_, had given space\r\nfor a weekly suffrage column edited by Mrs. Thompson. Mrs. J. C.\r\nGreenley edited a similar column in the Greenville _Democrat_. Mrs.\r\nMadge Quin Fugler supplied five papers and Mrs. Montgomery two. Miss\r\nIda Ward of Greenville wrote articles for the papers of that town and\r\nMrs. Mohlenhoff edited a column in the Cleveland _Enterprise_. Among\r\nother papers publishing suffrage material were the McComb City\r\n_Journal_ and the _Enterprise_ and the Magnolia _Gazette_. From the\r\npress superintendent there had gone out 1,700 articles, ranging in\r\nlength from a paragraph to a half page, many of them written by her,\r\nand they were given prominence in special editions. Ten copies of the\r\n_Woman's Journal_ which came from the national press department for\r\nyears were forwarded to college, town and State libraries and to\r\neditors. How far and deep the influence of those _Journals_ reached is\r\nbeyond computation.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1910 the State association joined the Tennessee Equal\r\nSuffrage Association in a booth at the Tri-State Fair in Memphis. An\r\ninteresting feature was the press exhibit, consisting of a width of\r\ncanvass many yards long on which had been pasted clippings from\r\nMississippi newspapers, suffrage argument and favorable comment. The\r\nannual convention was held in Cleveland in 1911. Miss Gordon and Judge\r\nThomas spoke at the evening session. Editor C. E. Glasco gave an\r\nearnest talk at a morning session. The department chairmen brought\r\nencouraging reports of their work. A letter was read from Colonel Clay\r\nSharkey of Jackson, which later was published in leaflet form.\r\n\r\nThe State meeting was held at Flora in April, 1912. Mrs. Judith Hyams\r\nDouglas, president of the Era Club of New Orleans, and Omar Garwood of\r\nColorado, secretary of the National Men's League for Woman Suffrage,\r\nwere the principal speakers. The president, Mrs. Somerville,\r\nrecommended that the various State organizations of women be invited\r\nto unite with the suffrage association in forming a central committee\r\nto secure such legislation as should be agreed upon by all. This was\r\nafterwards accepted by the Federation of Women's Clubs and the United\r\nDaughters of the Confederacy. Resolutions were passed regretting the\r\nretirement from the presidency of Mrs. Somerville, to whose good\r\ngeneralship during the past four years the success of the association\r\nwas in a large part due. Mrs. Lily Wilkinson Thompson was elected\r\npresident.\r\n\r\nIn response to the call to take part in the parade in Washington March\r\n3, 1913, Mrs. Avery Harrell Thompson, temporarily residing there, was\r\nput in charge and with her husband, Harmon L. Thompson, arranged for a\r\nhandsome float, on which Miss Fannie May Witherspoon, daughter of the\r\nmember of Congress, represented Mississippi. Mr. Gibbs, a\r\nMississippian, carried the purple and gold silk banner of the State\r\nSuffrage Association and four other young Mississippians, Judge Allen\r\nThompson and his brother, Harmon, Walter and Edward Dent, marched\r\nbeside the float, preforming valiant volunteer police duty when it\r\nbecame necessary. During this year the enrolled membership increased\r\nfour-fold. Quarterly reports, nearly a thousand, were printed for the\r\nfirst time instead of written. A letter from the Irish Women's League\r\nof Dublin and one from the English Women's Equal Rights Union to the\r\nState president indicated the world-wide spirit of fraternalism which\r\nembraced even Mississippi's modest organization. Good work was done by\r\nthe new superintendent of press work, Mrs. Dent. Not only did editors\r\nby this time willingly accept material but some of them wrote\r\nfavorable editorials. The Yazoo City _Herald_, edited by N. A. Mott,\r\nwas a new recruit. The _Purple and White_, a Millsaps College paper,\r\nwas supplied with suffrage material by a bright senior, Janie\r\nLinfield.\r\n\r\nFor the first time suffrage headquarters were maintained at the State\r\nFair by the Equity League of Jackson. Furnishings were loaned by Mr.\r\nand Mrs. C. C. Warren from their beautiful home \"Fairview.\" A rest\r\nroom for mothers and babies was provided, other tired visitors were\r\nalso welcomed and the suffrage booth was the most popular place on the\r\ngrounds. For the first time the association was invited to take part\r\non Woman's Day at the State Fair, when representatives from the\r\nwomen's State organizations held a joint meeting, and the president,\r\nMrs. Thompson, spoke for the suffragists.\r\n\r\nLetters were sent to the Mississippi members of Congress urging them\r\nto vote for the Federal Suffrage Amendment and to President Wilson,\r\npleading for his favorable consideration. Motion pictures were\r\nutilized in three ways--suffrage plays were shown, local clubs selling\r\ntickets received a part of the proceeds and suffrage slogans were\r\nthrown on the slides between pictures.\r\n\r\nThe State convention was held in the Senate Chamber of the new Capitol\r\nat Jackson in April, 1913. At the evening sessions all seats on the\r\nfloor were taken, the galleries filled and chairs brought from\r\ncommittee rooms to accommodate the audiences. Music was furnished by\r\nthe Chaminade Club of Jackson. Mayor Swepson I. Taylor gave the\r\naddress of welcome. Others who spoke were Mrs. Fannie S. Clark, Mrs.\r\nE. T. Edmonds, president of the Equity League, and Mrs.\r\nRoyden-Douglas, president of the State Federation of Women's Clubs. In\r\nher president's address Mrs. Thompson recommended that the association\r\nask the next Legislature to submit to the voters a State\r\nconstitutional amendment giving women the ballot, and this was\r\nunanimously adopted. The Rev. E. T. Edmonds of the First Christian\r\nChurch of Jackson spoke on Woman Suffrage in New Zealand, where he had\r\nbeen a resident.\r\n\r\nLetters to the president and secretary from U. S. Senators John Sharp\r\nWilliams and James K. Vardaman were read in reply to appeals that they\r\nvote for the Federal Amendment. Senator Vardaman said that when the\r\namendment came up he would \"be glad to vote for it.\" Senator Williams\r\nsaid that he thought \"the federal government ought not attempt to\r\ncontrol a State in the exercise of this privilege,\" that he favored a\r\n\"white woman's primary, in which the women of the State might say\r\nwhether they wanted the ballot or not\" and that he thought women just\r\nas competent to use it as men but did not approve of \"forcing it upon\r\nthem.\" He was \"inclined to woman suffrage\" and believed that \"with\r\nsafeguards it might be made a bulwark of white supremacy in the\r\nState.\" The large reception planned by Governor and Mrs. Earl Brewer\r\nhad to be omitted because of the sudden illness of Mrs. Brewer. On\r\naccount of home demands Mrs. Thompson declined re-election and Mrs.\r\nDent was made president.\r\n\r\nUnder Mrs. Dent's administration the work prospered and advanced in\r\npopular favor. In the fall \"woman suffrage day\" was for the first time\r\non the calendar of the State Fair. Headquarters were again maintained,\r\nfor which space three times as large as that used the previous year\r\nwas occupied. Mrs. Dent, a successful cotton planter, brought a bale\r\nof cotton from her plantation and presented it to the headquarters,\r\nwhere it afforded a unique platform for the speakers. Women from\r\ndifferent parts of the State came to act as hostesses and take part in\r\nthe speaking. This year a college contest was conducted by Mrs.\r\nThompson, who offered a gold medal for the best argument for woman\r\nsuffrage written by a college student of the State. Six of the largest\r\ncolleges were represented and the medal was won by Mrs. Pearl Powell,\r\nof the Industrial Institute and College.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1914, the State convention was again held in Jackson. Among\r\nthe speakers were Rabbi Brill of Meridian and Mrs. Alex Y. Scott of\r\nMemphis. Mrs. Dent was re-elected president. In the fall for the first\r\ntime there was a suffrage section in the parade that marked the\r\nopening of the State Fair. Six women, gowned in white and wearing\r\nyellow silk Votes for Women badges marched--Mrs. Ella O. Biggs and\r\nMiss Sadie Goeber bearing a banner inscribed Women vote in twelve\r\nStates, why not in Mississippi? followed by Mrs. Thompson, Mrs. Avery\r\nHarrell Thompson, Mrs. Sarah C. Watts and Mrs. R. W. Durfey and they\r\nwere generously cheered along the way.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1915 the State convention was held in Greenville. Dr.\r\nShaw was a guest, stopping on her way to Jackson, where under the\r\nauspices of the Equity League she spoke in the House of\r\nRepresentatives to a large audience, many standing throughout her\r\naddress, which made a profound impression. The convention was well\r\nattended. Some of the interesting features were \"an hour for men\"\r\npresided over by Congressman B. G. Humphries, with excellent speeches;\r\na five o'clock tea, given by the Belvidere Chapter of the Daughters of\r\nthe American Revolution, and the presentation of the motion picture\r\nplay, Your Girl and Mine. Miss Pauline V. Orr was elected president.\r\nMiss Orr served as president for two years, widely extending the\r\ninfluence of the association through the hundreds of young women who\r\ncame under her instruction at the Industrial Institute and College,\r\nwhere for many years she held the chair of English.\r\n\r\nThe annual convention was held in 1916 in the city hall in Meridian,\r\nwhere nineteen years before the State Woman Suffrage Association was\r\norganized, and Mrs. Pattie Ruffner Jacobs of Alabama, auditor of the\r\nNational Association, made an address on the opening evening. During\r\nthe following year eight new leagues were formed. The convention met\r\nin Starkville in April, 1917, and addresses were made by Dr. Shaw,\r\nMiss Margaret Hamilton Erwin, president of the Tennessee Equal\r\nSuffrage Association; Mrs. Walter McNab Miller, first vice-president\r\nof the National Association; Mrs. W. H. Price, president of the\r\nMississippi Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, and\r\nMrs. Edward F. McGehee, president of the State Federation of Women's\r\nClubs. Miss Orr, the president, declining re-election was succeeded by\r\nMrs. McGehee. The United States had now entered the war and the\r\nsuffragists began to concentrate on war work. As chairman of the\r\nWoman's Committee, Mississippi Division of the National Council of\r\nDefense, she was able to help popularize woman suffrage.[101]\r\n\r\nIn April, 1918, a one-day conference was held in the Capitol at\r\nJackson, when Mrs. Marion B. Trotter of Winona was elected president\r\nand brought a great deal of energy and enthusiasm into her office. No\r\nconvention was held in 1919 but at the close of the meeting of the\r\nState Federation of Women's Clubs in Clarksdale in November a\r\nconference of the suffragists present was called. It was there decided\r\nto organize to support the ratification of the Federal Amendment,\r\nwhich had been submitted by Congress and was to come before the\r\nLegislature the following January. Mrs. B. F. Saunders of Swan Lake,\r\nretiring president of the federation, was made chairman of the\r\nRatification Committee; Mrs. Trotter, treasurer; Mrs. Somerville\r\nchairman of Petition and Press Work; Mrs. McClurg chairman of Finance.\r\nBy request the National Association sent into the State its\r\norganizers, Miss Watkins of Arkansas and Miss Peshakova of New York.\r\nMrs. Cunningham, president of the Texas Equal Suffrage Association and\r\na national worker, also came to assist. Petitions were circulated,\r\nleaflets published and distributed, newspapers enlisted and\r\nlegislators systematically interviewed. The organization thus speedily\r\neffected worked during the session of 1920. In April of this year the\r\nconvention of the State Federation, held in Gulfport, closed with a\r\n\"suffrage luncheon,\" a brilliant affair attended by 125 prominent men\r\nand women. Speeches were made by the Hon. Barney Eaton, a lawyer of\r\nGulfport; Mrs. S. P. Covington, its president, and others. The State\r\nLeague of Women Voters was organized at this time with Miss Blanche\r\nRogers chairman.\r\n\r\nIt had been the hope for years to have an endorsement of woman\r\nsuffrage from the Federation of Women's Clubs, a strong and popular\r\norganization numbering over 3,000 of the State's leading women. During\r\nits annual meeting in 1916 Miss Orr, president of the State Suffrage\r\nAssociation, had introduced a favorable resolution and with Mrs.\r\nSomerville, Mrs. J. W. McGrath of Canton, Mrs. William Baldwin of\r\nColumbus and Mrs. W. S. Lott of Meridian led the fight for suffrage.\r\nMrs. William R. Wright of Jackson headed the opposition, which asked\r\nfor the postponement of the question until the next year and won. At\r\nthe next convention, held in Meridian in 1917, the resolution was\r\nintroduced by Miss Ann Rothenberg (now Mrs. Rosenbaum) of Meridian\r\nand passed almost unanimously. In 1919 at the annual meeting held in\r\nClarksdale, during the presidency of Mrs. Saunders, a resolution\r\nendorsing the ratification of the Federal Suffrage Amendment was\r\ncarried with but one dissenting vote, that of Mrs. Lizzie George\r\nHenderson of Greenwood, daughter of the late U. S. Senator J. Z.\r\nGeorge. When the League of Women Voters was formed the next year Mrs.\r\nHenderson was among the first to join it.\r\n\r\nIn 1919, the State Teachers' Association passed unanimously a\r\nresolution endorsing woman suffrage introduced by Professor Frederick\r\nDavis Mellen of the State Agricultural and Mechanical College, the son\r\nof the late Reverend Thomas L. Mellen, one of Mississippi's earliest\r\nsuffragists. The Woman's Christian Temperance Union here as elsewhere\r\nwas a great school for women, teaching them the need of the ballot,\r\nand the majority of its members were suffragists but all through the\r\nyears the minority, who did not want the question brought into the\r\nUnion, overruled their wishes. Mrs. Harriet B. Kells, the president\r\nfor many years and a lifelong suffragist, was not able to overcome\r\nthis situation and it never endorsed woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nThere never has been any organized opposition among Mississippi women.\r\nDuring the session of the Legislature in 1920 there was an open\r\nattempt to organize opposition to ratification of the Federal\r\nAmendment but it failed.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. After the suffrage association in 1913 decided to\r\nask for the submission of an amendment to the State constitution to\r\nenfranchise women the preliminary work of interviewing legislators and\r\ndistributing appropriate literature was conducted by the chairman of\r\nthe Legislative Committee, Mrs. Nellie Nugent Somerville, the\r\npresident, Mrs. Annie Kinkead Dent, and other members. The president\r\nat her own expense sent the _Woman's Journal_ and other literature to\r\nall legislators for three months. The concurrent resolution asking for\r\nthe submission was introduced in the House Jan. 9, 1914, by N. A. Mott\r\nof Yazoo county. Senator Hall Sanders of Tallahatchie county offered\r\nit in the Senate three days later. The House Committee on\r\nConstitution, to which the bill was referred, granted a hearing, at\r\nwhich speeches were made by Mrs. Monroe McClurg, Miss Belle Kearney,\r\nMrs. Somerville, Miss Kate Gordon (La.), Judge Allen Thompson and\r\nColonel Clay Sharkey. The committee reported unfavorably by a majority\r\nof one. A minority report was made by the chairman, Henry A. Minor of\r\nNoxubee county, and others. Representative Mott offered a resolution\r\ninviting the women to present their case in the House the next day,\r\nwhich was carried by a close vote about one o'clock in the afternoon\r\nand the hearing was set for ten the next morning. The _Daily News_ had\r\ngone to press and the _Clarion Ledger_, a morning paper, had some time\r\nbefore forbidden its columns to any news or notices in any way\r\nfavoring woman suffrage or advertising it.\r\n\r\nThe president of the Equity League of Jackson, Mrs. J. W. Tucker, with\r\nher assistants, announced the hearing over the telephone, the\r\nlegislators spread the story and when the women who were to speak\r\nfiled into the House on that memorable morning of January 21 they\r\nfound all available space occupied and the galleries overflowing. An\r\ninvitation was sent to the Senators to come over but so many had\r\nalready deserted their posts for the House that there was not a quorum\r\nto vote on the invitation. Hilary Quin of Hinds county, Speaker of the\r\nHouse, presided, introducing the speakers and extending every possible\r\ncourtesy. They were Mrs. McClurg, Miss Kearney, Miss Orr, Miss Gordon,\r\nMrs. Thompson, Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Somerville. The speeches made so\r\nprofound an impression that hardly had the last word been spoken when\r\nthere came a loud and insistent call from the enemies for adjournment.\r\nThe bill was presented next day. Emmett Cavette of Noxubee county\r\nstrongly championed it and Speaker Quin left the chair to make a\r\nspeech in its favor. Representative S. Joe Owen of Union county\r\nvigorously led the fight against it and it was lost by 80 noes, 42\r\nayes.\r\n\r\nIn 1916 the women's organizations united in a bill making women\r\neligible to serve as county school superintendents and on the boards\r\nof educational and benevolent institutions. During the session of 1918\r\nthe suffrage association being in the midst of war work took no\r\ninitiative in behalf of legislation but Senator Earl Richardson of\r\nNeshoba county on his own account introduced in the Senate a\r\nconcurrent resolution to amend the State constitution. The members of\r\nthe Equity League gave assistance; Mrs. Isaac Reese of Memphis was\r\ninvited to come to the Capitol and on the day the vote was taken she\r\nand Miss Kearney made brief speeches before the Senate. On motion of\r\nSenator P. E. Carothers the question was submitted without debate,\r\nwhich was a disappointment to its friends, H. H. Casteel of Holmes\r\ncounty declaring that he had remained up nearly all of the night\r\nbefore preparing his speech. The vote was a tie, 21 to 21. The House\r\ntook no action.\r\n\r\nThrough the years the officers and members of the State and local\r\nsuffrage associations united with those of other women's organizations\r\nto obtain laws. The age of consent was raised first to 12, then to 16\r\nand in 1914 to 18; better child labor laws were secured; the law\r\npermitting a father to dispose of the children by will at his death\r\nwas repealed. It is a fact not generally known that Mississippi was\r\nthe pioneer State in securing to married women the right to own and\r\ndispose of property. This was done by an Act of the Legislature on\r\nFeb. 15, 1839.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. Congress submitted the Federal Amendment in June, and\r\nthe Ratification Committee was organized in November. It opened its\r\nheadquarters in Jackson at the beginning of the legislative session in\r\nJanuary, 1920, after having made a whirlwind campaign. At the initial\r\nmeeting of the committee in Clarksburg there had been great enthusiasm\r\nand women gave money as they never had done before. Mrs. B. F.\r\nSaunders was made chairman and among those who worked with her in\r\nJackson were Mrs. Somerville, Mrs. Trotter, Mrs. Sam Covington, Miss\r\nBlanche Rogers, Mrs. Thompson, Miss Kearney, Mrs. Annie Neely and Mrs.\r\nCunningham of Texas. The legislators were systematically interviewed,\r\nliterature distributed, petitions circulated and the press kept\r\nsupplied with arguments and news.\r\n\r\nMrs. Thompson, in charge of the Jackson press, wrote innumerable\r\narticles, and Mrs. Somerville and others contributed to the press\r\nwork. Letters, telegrams and petitions from all over the State urging\r\nratification poured in daily upon both Houses. Delegations of women\r\ncame to urge their representatives to vote for ratification. Nine\r\ninfluential women came from Lauderdale county bringing a petition of\r\n2,100 names of prominent people obtained in a day and a half and\r\nbegged their representatives to vote for the amendment but not one of\r\nthem did so.\r\n\r\nMany of the State's leading newspapers were in favor of ratification.\r\nThe _Daily News_ of Jackson, in keeping with its policy for years,\r\ngave editorial support and generously of its space. The _Clarion\r\nLedger_, also a Jackson daily, boasted of being the only paper in the\r\nState which openly fought ratification. The editor, Colonel Hiram\r\nHenry, a veteran journalist of the State, always bitterly opposed to\r\nany form of woman suffrage, began his attack weeks before the\r\nLegislature met and daily during the session the pages of his paper\r\nreeked with hatred for the cause. The literature of the \"antis\" was\r\nlargely copied and extracts from negro journals published in the North\r\nwere reproduced in glaring headlines, extracts so offensive that had\r\nthey been used against any cause save that of disfranchised women\r\nwould have been suppressed. It was through his influence that Mrs.\r\nCola Barr Craig, once a resident of Jackson, and Mrs. James S.\r\nPinckard of Alabama came early in January to organize a branch of what\r\nthey called the Southern Women's Rejection League. They held a public\r\nmeeting in the Carnegie library, at which besides the two speakers,\r\nthere were nineteen women present, many of them the old friends of\r\nMrs. Craig. No one would take even the temporary chairmanship and the\r\nattempt to organize failed ignominiously. Not daunted Mr. Henry sent\r\nfor Miss Kate Gordon of New Orleans, a veteran suffragist who had\r\njoined hands with the \"antis\" in fighting ratification. She was\r\nadvertised for a speech at the Carnegie library and all legislators\r\nwere urged to attend. Two legislators and fifteen women were present,\r\nsix of the latter State workers for ratification.\r\n\r\nThe retiring and incoming State officials were almost to a man\r\noutspoken in their advocacy of ratification. Governor Theodore G.\r\nBilbo, the retiring Governor, instead of having the clerk of the House\r\nread his farewell message, according to time honored custom, delivered\r\nit in person. Woman suffrage was its conspicuous feature and after a\r\nprofound argument for ratification of the Federal Amendment, he closed\r\nhis remarks with the solemn statement: \"Woe to that man who raises\r\nhis hand against the onward march of this progressive movement!\" The\r\nnewly elected Governor, Lee M. Russell, in his inaugural address,\r\ndelivered in front of the Capitol to an audience of thousands, devoted\r\nmore time to woman suffrage than to any other topic, making a clear\r\ncut, logical argument for ratification and a powerful plea for the\r\nenfranchisement of women.\r\n\r\nOn January 21, W. A. Winter, Representative from Grenada county,\r\noffered the following resolution: \"Resolved that the proposed\r\namendment to the Constitution of the United States be and hereby is\r\nrejected as an unwarranted, unnecessary and dangerous interference\r\nwith the rights reserved to the States, or to the people, in both\r\nState and Federal Constitutions....\" This came without warning to the\r\nfriends of ratification and was not referred to a committee but rushed\r\nto a vote after Representative Guy W. Mitchell of Lee county had\r\nspoken strongly against it. It was carried by a vote of 94 ayes to 25\r\nnoes and the announcement received with cheers and laughter. Sennett\r\nConner of Covington county was the Speaker of the House whose ruling\r\npermitted this unparliamentary action.\r\n\r\nSent to the Senate the Winter Resolution of Rejection was referred to\r\nthe Committee on Constitution, of which Senator Minor was chairman. At\r\nthe meeting of the committee W. B. Mixon of Pike county was authorized\r\nto draft a resolution ratifying the amendment, to be offered in the\r\nSenate as a substitute. This was done and Senators Minor, Mixon and\r\nFred B. Smith made a majority report. This resolution was earnestly\r\nadvocated by Senators Percy Bell and Walton Shields of Washington\r\ncounty, W. B. Roberts of Bolivar, Fred B. Smith of Union, A. A. Cohn\r\nof Lincoln and E. F. Noel of Holmes. It failed of adoption and the\r\nWinter resolution was recommitted to the Committee on Constitution,\r\nwhere it remained.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Senator Mixon had introduced a bill in the Senate\r\ngiving the right to women to vote in Primary elections and\r\nRepresentative A. J. Whitworth of Pike county a similar one in the\r\nHouse. In Mississippi a nomination is equivalent to an election. Both\r\nbills were defeated. A resolution for a woman suffrage amendment to\r\nthe State constitution to be submitted to the voters at the election\r\nof November, 1920, passed both Houses with very little opposition.\r\nDuring the last three weeks of the session Senator Mixon introduced a\r\nbill giving the right of suffrage to women in the event of the\r\nratification of the Federal Amendment by thirty-six Legislatures, thus\r\nenabling them to vote in the August primaries, and Representative\r\nWhitworth introduced two bills, one giving suffrage to women in\r\nprimary elections and the other in general elections, both contingent\r\nupon ratification. These bills passed without opposition.\r\n\r\nDuring the last week of the Legislature Senator Roberts called out of\r\nthe committee the original Winter Resolution of Rejection and in\r\nCommittee of the Whole it was amended by striking out the word\r\n\"reject\" and substituting the word \"ratify.\" Thus amended the vote in\r\nthe Senate stood 21 ayes, 21 noes and Lieutenant Governor H. H.\r\nCasteel broke the tie in favor of its adoption. News of the Senate's\r\nfavorable action spread all over the country in a few hours. Telegrams\r\ncame pouring in to the Governor and Legislature offering\r\ncongratulations and appealing to the House to make Mississippi the\r\n36th State to ratify.\r\n\r\nThe Senate substitute was presented to the House the next afternoon,\r\nMarch 31. Representative Winter moved that the House \"do not concur\r\nwith the Senate Resolution of Ratification.\" Immediately there came\r\ncalls for the vote. Telegrams were on the Speaker's stand from William\r\nJennings Bryan, Homer Cummings, chairman of the Democratic National\r\nCommittee, Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels, Attorney General A.\r\nMitchell Palmer and many other prominent Democrats. A vote was taken\r\nas to whether these should be read to the House. Representative E. M.\r\nLane of Smith county, although an opponent of ratification, made an\r\nearnest appeal that the courtesy of a hearing should be accorded these\r\nnational party leaders. A vote of 65 to 32 decided that the telegrams\r\nshould not be read. Governor Russell had stated that he desired the\r\nprivilege of the floor to make an appeal in behalf of ratification but\r\nthis courtesy was denied him. Representatives T. D. Rees of Prentiss\r\ncounty and Walter Sillers of Bolivar spoke in favor of ratification\r\nbut were poorly heard so great was the confusion and so loud and\r\ninsistent the calls for the vote. Representative Mitchell was absent.\r\nDr. Whitworth (author of three suffrage bills at this session) spoke\r\nagainst ratification and while he was speaking Representative R. H.\r\nWatts of Rankin county interpolated, \"I would die and go to hell\r\nbefore I would vote for it.\" The substitute was defeated by 94 noes,\r\n23 ayes.\r\n\r\nThus was banished forever the dream of Mississippi suffragists that\r\nthe women would receive the ballot from the men of this great State.\r\nSpeaker Sennett Conner was responsible above every one else for the\r\ndefeat of ratification. Its chance was weakened by the fact that\r\nMississippi's entire delegation in Congress, including Senators John\r\nSharp Williams and \"Pat\" Harrison had voted against submitting the\r\nFederal Amendment.\r\n\r\nDid space permit there would be added to the names mentioned in this\r\nchapter many others who gave \"aid and comfort\" to the cause. Among\r\nthose who never failed when asked to help with financial burdens was\r\nthe late Major R. W. Millsaps, founder of Millsaps College for men and\r\nwomen. The army of active suffragists was never large. Many women\r\nwanted the ballot but comparatively few were under conviction to work\r\nfor it. To those who did, especially in early, trying days, belongs\r\nthat indescribable exultation which is the portion of those who help\r\nonward a great revolutionary movement for the uplift of the race.\r\n\r\nThe amendment to the State constitution was voted on at the general\r\nelection in November, 1920, and received 39,186 ayes, 24,296 noes but\r\nit was not carried, as the law requires a majority of all the votes\r\ncast at the election. As the women were already enfranchised by the\r\nFederal Amendment they did not make a campaign for it but as\r\nregistration is necessary four months before election and the\r\nratification did not take place until two months before this one, they\r\nwere not able to vote, Mississippi and Georgia being the only two\r\nStates that denied this privilege.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[100] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Lily Wilkinson\r\nThompson, an officer in the State Suffrage Association from its\r\norganization until its work was finished.\r\n\r\n[101] Besides those mentioned the following served on the official\r\nboard: Mrs. Jimmie Andrews Lipscomb, Mrs. Nella Lawrence Lee, Miss\r\nMattie Kirkpatrick, Mrs. Annie Kinkead Dent, Mrs. Ella O. Biggs, Mrs.\r\nAlma Dorsey Birdsall, Mrs. Durrant, Mrs. Edith Marshall Tucker, Mrs.\r\nMary Powell Crane, Miss Ethel Clagett, Mrs. C. C. Miller, Mrs. T. F.\r\nBuntin, Miss Estelle Crane, Miss Nannie Herndon Rice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nMISSOURI.[102]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the last volume of the history of woman suffrage was written in\r\n1900 Missouri was one of the blackest spots on the suffrage map and\r\nthere was little to indicate that it would ever be lighter. The able\r\nand courageous women who inaugurated the movement in 1867, Mrs.\r\nVirginia L. Minor, Mrs. Beverly Allen, Mrs. Rebecca Hazzard, Miss\r\nPhoebe Couzins and Mrs. Sarah Chandler Coates, were no longer living\r\nor past the age for strenuous work. A few women kept up a semblance of\r\na State organization, met annually and in 1901 Mrs. Addie Johnson was\r\nelected president; in 1902 Mrs. Louis Werth and in 1903 Mrs. Alice\r\nMulkley, but there was great apathy among women in general. From 1903\r\nto 1910 no State convention was held. In St. Louis, which comprised\r\none-fourth of the inhabitants of the State, there was no visible\r\norganization working for woman suffrage. The largest and most\r\ninfluential woman's club refused to allow the subject on its programs.\r\nDuring the decade to 1910 only one speaker of national prominence came\r\ninto the State--Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, the president of the\r\nNational American Woman Suffrage Association--and evidently at the\r\nnational headquarters Missouri was considered too hopeless to\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\nThe movement was only smoldering, however, and needed but a spark to\r\nburst into flame and that spark came from afar--from the torch held\r\nhigh by the \"militant\" suffragists of England. In no State perhaps was\r\nthere more bitter invective hurled at them than by the press and\r\npeople of Missouri but the conscience of the convinced suffragists was\r\naroused. Stirring addresses in St. Louis by Stanton Coit of London and\r\nJohn Lovejoy Elliott of New York in defense of the English\r\n\"militants\" brought matters to a crisis and a few bold spirits\r\ndecided to reorganize the scattered suffrage forces.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1910, Mrs. Florence Wyman Richardson, Miss Marie R. Garesche\r\nand Miss Florence Richardson (later Mrs. Roland R. Usher) barely out\r\nof her teens, renounced society and invited twenty or twenty-five\r\nwomen, whom they thought might be interested, to meet in Miss\r\nGaresche's home. Only five responded, Miss Bertha Rombauer, Miss\r\nJennie M. A. Jones, Mrs. Robert Atkinson, Miss Lillian Heltzell and\r\nMrs. Dan Knefler. Not at all daunted it was decided as a first step to\r\nengage a prominent lecturer. Miss Ethel Arnold, the well-known\r\nEnglishwoman, a suffragist but not a \"militant,\" was then touring this\r\ncountry and before the meeting adjourned a telegram was sent to her\r\nand the eight women present guaranteed the sum to cover her charge and\r\nthe rent of a hall. As her itinerary would bring her to St. Louis\r\nabout the middle of April it was thought best to organize immediately,\r\nso that the publicity which would undoubtedly be given to Miss Arnold\r\nwould be shared by the infant society. A circular letter outlining the\r\nproject was sent broadcast and April 8 about fifty women gathered at\r\nthe residence of Mrs. Richardson and effected an organization. Thus\r\ncame into being the St. Louis Equal Suffrage League, which was\r\ndestined to play the principal part in winning the vote for the women\r\nof the State. The following officers were elected: President, Mrs.\r\nRichardson; first vice-president, Miss Garesche; second, Mrs.\r\nAtkinson; corresponding secretary, Miss Rombauer; recording secretary,\r\nMiss Heltzell; treasurer, Mrs. Knefler; auditor, Mrs. Leslie Thompson.\r\n\r\nMiss Arnold's lecture took place April 11 and her charm, culture and\r\ncogent reasoning won many friends to the cause and disarmed many of\r\nits opponents. Branch organizations were soon formed in the northern\r\nand southern parts of the city with Mrs. Atlanta Hecker and Miss\r\nCecilia Razovsky as presidents. Meetings were held in the Cabanne\r\nBranch Library and before the end of the year the members had\r\nincreased to 275.[103] During the first year the league brought a\r\nnumber of lecturers to the city, realizing that this was the most\r\nvaluable form of propaganda in a community so entrenched in\r\nconservatism. Among them were Mr. and Mrs. Philip Snowden of England;\r\nProfessor Frances Squire Potter of the University of Minnesota; Mrs.\r\nLucia Ames Mead of Boston; Professor Nathaniel Schmidt of Cornell and\r\nProfessor Earl Barnes of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nOn Nov. 3, 1911, Mrs. Emmeline Pankhurst of England, at the invitation\r\nof the league, lectured in the Odeon, the largest hall in the city, to\r\nan audience that taxed its capacity. Her charming personality set at\r\nrest all fears as to the ill effect of suffrage, even of the\r\n\"militant\" variety, on feminine grace and refinement. Soon afterwards\r\nthe Mary Institute Alumnae Association invited Miss Sylvia Pankhurst\r\nto lecture and the result was most gratifying to the friends of\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\nThe old State organization having ceased to exist the St. Louis league\r\nwith its branches and the recently formed Webster Groves Suffrage\r\nLeague, Mrs. Lee Roseborough, president, met in St. Louis Feb. 14,\r\n1911, and organized a State Woman Suffrage Association, which\r\naffiliated with the National American Association. The officers were:\r\nPresident, Mrs. Atkinson; vice-president, Mrs. Morrison-Fuller;\r\ncorresponding secretary, Mrs. Boyd; recording secretary, Miss\r\nRombauer; treasurer, Miss Jane Thompson; auditor, Mrs. R. D. McArthur.\r\nOwing to various causes this board was in a few months reduced to\r\nthree working members, Mrs. Atkinson, Mrs. Boyd and Miss Rombauer.\r\nRealizing that it must enlist the support of the press they sent out\r\nletters to a long list of the State editors and favorable replies were\r\nreceived from twenty-six, who promised to give a weekly column in\r\ntheir papers for suffrage news and propaganda. All the libraries were\r\nwritten to and a number of them induced to procure the four large\r\nvolumes of the History of Woman Suffrage, generously offered by the\r\nNational Association. The librarians, who were often women, were asked\r\nto keep on hand a supply of suffrage literature. The St. Louis public\r\nlibrary, at the suggestion of the board, made a special exhibit of\r\nthis literature, much of which was new. In the center of the exhibit\r\nwas a large picture of William T. Harris, former superintendent of\r\nschools in St. Louis and later U. S. Commissioner of Education, with\r\nhis strong testimony in favor of woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nMrs. Atkinson was permitted to make an address on suffrage before the\r\nState Federation of Women's Clubs at Sedalia but no action was taken.\r\nShe also addressed a large audience at the dedication of the Woman's\r\nBuilding which had been erected by the Legislature on the State Fair\r\ngrounds near that city and Mrs. Walter McNab Miller of Columbia also\r\nmade an address. The board paid a lawyer to compile the State laws for\r\nwomen under the direction of E. M. Grossman. Mrs. Atkinson, Mrs. Boyd\r\nand Mrs. John L. Lowes of St. Louis and Mrs. Virginia Hedges of\r\nWarrensburg went as delegates to the convention of the National\r\nAssociation in 1911 at Louisville, where much satisfaction was\r\nexpressed that Missouri had at last come into the fold. The Kansas\r\nCity League was organized this year with Mrs. Henry N. Ess, president;\r\nMiss Helen Osborn, secretary; and Mrs. Helena Cramer Leavens,\r\ntreasurer. The women of Warrensburg, under the leadership of Miss\r\nLaura Runyon, organized a club of fifty members. There was the State\r\nNormal School, to whose faculty Miss Runyon belonged, and through her\r\nthe support of the students was obtained and suffrage propaganda\r\nextended gradually to every section of the State. Mrs. Knefler,\r\npresident of the St. Louis Women's Trades Union, organized a league\r\namong its members, which, under the leadership of Mrs. Sarah Spraggon\r\nand Miss Sallie Quick, did excellent work in the campaigns that\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 a Business Woman's Suffrage League was formed in St. Louis\r\nunder the leadership of Miss Mary McGuire, a graduate of the St. Louis\r\nUniversity Law School, and Miss Jessie Lansing Moller, which starting\r\nwith 50 members, eventually numbered 250. The same year the Junior\r\nBranch of the St. Louis League was organized, which included many of\r\nthe younger society girls and matrons. Miss Ann Drew (later Mrs. James\r\nPlatt) was president. In Kansas City in the autumn the Southside Equal\r\nSuffrage League was formed with Mrs. Cora Kramer Leavens, president,\r\nand Miss Cora Best Jewell, secretary. A Men's Equal Suffrage League\r\nwas also organized with D. H. Hoff president; J. H. Austin,\r\nvice-president; David Proctor, secretary, which did a large work in\r\nsecuring the big vote given to the suffrage amendment in Kansas City\r\nand Jackson county in 1914.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 the first State convention was held in September at Sedalia,\r\nwhere Mrs. George Gellhorn was elected president and Mrs. John W.\r\nBarringer vice-president, both of St. Louis. They went to Jefferson\r\nCity in September and tried to get a suffrage plank into the platform\r\nof the Democratic State convention. Though unsuccessful it was the\r\ninitial step in bringing the subject out of the parlor and\r\nlecture-room into the sphere of politics, the arena where the battle\r\nultimately had to be fought. Twenty-eight leagues were formed this\r\nyear. Miss Amelia C. Fruchte, member of the St. Louis Central High\r\nSchool faculty, went before the State Teachers' Association and\r\nsecured its endorsement of woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nIn 1913 at the State convention held at St. Louis in September, Mrs.\r\nWalter McNab Miller, formerly of Ohio, was elected State president.\r\nShe had been the leading spirit in work for suffrage in Columbia, the\r\nseat of the State University, where her husband was a professor, and\r\nin November, 1912, an organization was formed with Dr. R. H. Jesse,\r\nformer president of the university, at its head. Though the State in\r\ngeneral was still apathetic the women in the large places, especially\r\nin St. Louis and Kansas City, were alert and active. Mrs. Richardson,\r\nafter two strenuous years, had been succeeded by Mrs. David O'Neil as\r\npresident of the St. Louis League. She was followed in October by Mrs.\r\nJohn L. Lowes, who had to resign from exhaustion and Mrs. O'Neil was\r\nagain elected.\r\n\r\nThe hard work that had been done was beginning to bear fruit and the\r\nFarmers' Alliance, the Prohibitionists, the Single Taxers and other\r\norganizations were seeking the cooperation of the suffrage societies.\r\nThe press was giving more and more space to suffrage news. Mrs. Emily\r\nNewell Blair of Carthage was a powerful influence with country\r\neditors. The St. Louis _Post Dispatch_ offered prizes amounting to\r\n$100 for the best arguments in favor and often contained strong\r\neditorials. Thanks largely to Miss Jane Winn, on the editorial staff\r\nof the _Globe Democrat_, suffrage news was seldom refused by that\r\npaper. The Kansas City _Star_ and the _Post_ gave strong support.\r\nBest of all, the women were gaining in courage and confidence. In\r\nSeptember the managers of a Merchants' and Manufacturers' Street\r\nExposition in St. Louis invited the suffragists to conduct a parade\r\nunder their auspices and a large number of automobiles and auto-trucks\r\ngaily decorated with white and yellow bunting and accompanied by\r\nseveral bands of music went through the principal downtown streets.\r\nThe crowds were respectful and occasionally enthusiastic. The\r\nenthusiasm of the paraders reached such a pitch that they left their\r\nprotecting cars and marched boldly down the middle of the street,\r\npreceded by a band playing \"Everybody's doing it.\" The details were\r\narranged by Mrs. W. W. Boyd, Jr.\r\n\r\nThe time was judged to be ripe for an organized effort to secure\r\naction at the general election of 1914 and two plans presented\r\nthemselves: First, to ask the Legislature to submit to the voters an\r\namendment to the State constitution giving full suffrage to women;\r\nsecond, to secure the necessary number of signatures under the newly\r\nenacted initiative petition law to place the amendment on the ballot\r\nregardless of action by the Legislature. The former method was tried\r\nfirst but the latter was found to be necessary. A finance committee\r\nwas appointed by the league to raise funds for the campaign and at a\r\nluncheon in St. Louis amid great enthusiasm $11,000 were pledged,\r\nwhich were turned over to Mrs. B. B. Graham, campaign treasurer.\r\nHeadquarters were opened down town with Mrs. Knefler, campaign\r\nmanager, in charge. The interest aroused throughout the State by the\r\ncirculating of the petition was manifested at the State convention in\r\nColumbia, in May, 1914, which was attended by a number of delegates\r\nfrom the country districts. Mrs. Miller was re-elected president. On\r\n\"suffrage day,\" May 1, men and women addressed crowds between acts at\r\ndifferent theaters and on the steps of public buildings. Miss Fola\r\nLaFollette was the speaker at a large evening meeting and addressed\r\nthe Men's City Club at luncheon the next day. The slogan was sent out\r\nfar and wide, \"Suffrage for Missouri in 1914.\" After the heavy task of\r\nobtaining 14,000 names to the petition and a strenuous campaign the\r\namendment was defeated at the polls.\r\n\r\nIn 1915 an offer was made by a newspaper man in Monet to publish a\r\nsuffrage magazine and eagerly accepted, the suffragists agreeing to\r\nfurnish the material and to work up the subscriptions. Mrs. Blair was\r\nthe first editor of the _Missouri Woman_ and all went well for a few\r\nmonths, then the publisher failed. This was a keen disappointment but\r\nthrough the efforts of Miss Mary Bulkley and Percy Werner of St.\r\nLouis, Flint Garrison, president of the Garrison-Wagner Printing\r\nCompany, a prominent Democrat and an ardent suffragist, became\r\ninterested and agreed to publish the magazine. It was adopted as the\r\norgan of the State Federation of Women's Clubs and was endorsed by the\r\nState branch of the National Congress of Mothers and the State Parent\r\nTeachers' Association. In March, 1916, Mrs. Blair, owing to the\r\ndifficulty of editing the magazine from her home in Carthage while it\r\nwas published in St. Louis, resigned as editor and was succeeded by\r\nMiss Mary Semple Scott of St. Louis, who continued in that office\r\nduring the remaining three years of its useful existence, until the\r\nwomen of the State had been partially enfranchised and the Federal\r\nSuffrage Amendment had been ratified by the Legislature.\r\n\r\nDuring 1916 the St. Louis Equal Suffrage League reorganized on\r\npolitical lines with a Central Committee composed of a member from\r\neach of the twenty-five wards. Mrs. William C. Fordyce, who for a long\r\ntime had urged this action, was unanimously elected chairman. At the\r\nconvention held in Springfield in May Mrs. John R. Leighty of Kansas\r\nCity succeeded Mrs. Miller, who had been elected first vice-president\r\nof the National Association and would reside in Washington. At the\r\nmeeting of the board held in St. Louis in June the State association\r\nalso was reorganized on political lines and a Congressional Committee\r\nof sixteen members representing the sixteen congressional districts\r\nwas appointed. The St. Louis League subscribed $500 to carry on the\r\nwork and Mrs. Charles Passmore was made chairman. The committees\r\nappealed to the Republican State convention to put a plank for woman\r\nsuffrage in its platform but with no success. Later, after the two\r\nnational parties had adopted suffrage planks, an effort was made to\r\nhave the State committees adopt the same plank but they refused.\r\n\r\nThe National Democratic Convention held in St. Louis in June, 1916,\r\noffered a splendid opportunity which both State and city suffragists\r\neagerly seized. Some unique schemes were evolved, among them the\r\n\"golden lane,\" the idea of Mrs. Blair. It has been described as \"a\r\nwalkless, talkless parade\" and consisted of about 7,000 women arranged\r\nin a double line on both sides of the street, the front row sitting,\r\nthe back row standing, all dressed in white with yellow sashes and\r\neach one carrying a yellow parasol. They held their places on the\r\nopening day of the convention, June 14, from 10 a. m. till noon, on\r\nboth sides of Locust Street for a distance of ten blocks, the route\r\nthe delegates had to take in going from their headquarters in the\r\nJefferson Hotel to the Coliseum, where the convention was held.\r\n\r\nAnother striking appeal was in the form of a beautiful and imposing\r\ntableau staged on the steps of the old Art Museum, also on the route\r\nof the delegates, which was given with an occasional interval of rest\r\nfor two long hours. The details were managed by Miss Virginia\r\nStevenson. Under a canopy of gold cloth, which cast a glow over the\r\ngroup below, there stood at the top of the steps \"Liberty,\" posed by\r\nhandsome Mrs. O'Neil. Grouped about her were thirteen women dressed in\r\nwhite representing the twelve equal suffrage States and Alaska.\r\nFarther down on the steps were the States in which only partial\r\nsuffrage had been granted, impersonated by women dressed in gray. At\r\nthe bottom were figures in black, representing the States where women\r\nwere wholly disfranchised, extending their manacled arms to Liberty. A\r\nmass meeting was held later in the day in the auditorium of the\r\nMuseum, when Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, William Jennings Bryan, U. S.\r\nSenator John F. Shafroth and Mrs. Miller addressed large and\r\nenthusiastic audiences. The Town Club, an organization of women, gave\r\na dinner with covers laid for 300, which was followed by music and\r\nspeaking in front of the Jefferson Hotel. On the same night there was\r\nstreet speaking on the principal down town corners for two hours, one\r\nspeaker relieving another as the crowds called for more. Miss Scott\r\nbrought out an impressive number of the _Missouri Woman_ during the\r\nconvention. William Burns, a well-known artist on the _Post Dispatch_,\r\ndesigned an attractive and significant cover and Miss Marguerite\r\nMartin illustrated a story by Mrs. Blair; editors of the St. Louis\r\ndailies, Louis Ely, Casper Yost and Paul W. Brown, contributed\r\neditorials and William Marion Reedy, editor of the St. Louis _Mirror_,\r\nwrote a charming article. The edition of 10,000 was sold at the\r\nbookstands and by volunteers who acted as \"newsies.\" The business men\r\nadvertised generously.\r\n\r\nThe result partially of all the hard work and enthusiasm was a woman\r\nsuffrage plank in the platform according to the Democratic principle\r\nof State's rights, which, though not entirely satisfactory to the\r\nsuffragists, was regarded as a decided victory.\r\n\r\nThe entrance of the United States in the World War in 1917 acted as a\r\ndeterrent of suffrage activities, as the various organizations threw\r\nthemselves whole-heartedly into war work. Mrs. Leighty, State\r\nchairman, Mrs. Stix, chairman of the St. Louis League, and other heads\r\nof suffrage societies throughout the State, had the difficult task of\r\ndirecting their activities in war work and at the same time keeping at\r\nthe front the idea that, while working to make the world safe for\r\ndemocracy abroad, the cause of democracy at home demanded the speedy\r\nenfranchisement of the women of America. Missouri's quota for the\r\nOversea Hospitals organized by the National Suffrage Association was\r\n$1,000. At a luncheon given by the St. Louis League May 8, where Mrs.\r\nCharles L. Tiffany of New York was the speaker, $4,331 were subscribed\r\nin fifteen minutes. Mrs. Miller was chairman of the Food Conservation\r\nCommittee of the National Association and Mrs. George Gellhorn\r\norganized its work for Missouri. All demands of the Government were\r\nfully met.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1917, the State convention was held at Kansas City and Mrs.\r\nMiller having returned from Washington was again elected president.\r\nThis year a Men's Advisory Committee in St. Louis was formed composed\r\nof 147 well-known residents organized under the following leaders:\r\nJackson Johnson, N. A. McMillan, Ernest W. Stix, Joseph Woracek,\r\nEdward F. Goltra, E. N. Grossman, Benjamin Gratz, J. L. Babler. A\r\nteachers' division including many thousand was formed, with Miss\r\nTillie Gecks as president. Largely through the efforts of the\r\nexecutive secretary of the St. Louis league, Mrs. Lucille B.\r\nLowenstein, its membership in 1918 was increased to 8,000. Mrs. Stix,\r\nresigning because of illness, Mrs. Gellhorn was elected.\r\n\r\nAt the State convention held at Macon in May, 1918, Mrs. Miller was\r\nre-elected. Owing to the splendid organization of the St. Louis League\r\nit was able to invite the National Suffrage Association to hold its\r\nGolden Jubilee in this city in 1919. It was held March 23-29 inclusive\r\nat the Statler Hotel with two evening mass meetings at the Odeon, and\r\nwas declared by Mrs. Catt to have been \"the best convention ever held\r\nanywhere.\" A large group of women worked indefatigably for weeks in\r\nadvance to make it a success but to Mrs. Gellhorn, chairman of the\r\nLocal Arrangements Committee, must go the chief honor. Second must be\r\nplaced the name of Mrs. Stix, who had raised the funds to defray the\r\nlocal expenses.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of March 28 was held one of the mass meetings. The\r\nlarge auditorium of the Odeon, beautifully decorated for the occasion\r\nunder the supervision of Mrs. Fred Taussig and Mrs. Everett W.\r\nPattison, was filled to overflowing. On the stage were Mrs. Catt, Dr.\r\nShaw and the other national officers, also the speakers of the\r\nevening, among whom were Governor Henry J. Allen of Kansas and Miss\r\nHelen Frazier of England. Suddenly music was heard from the back. It\r\nheralded the Missouri delegation, composed of Mrs. Miller, Mrs. David\r\nO'Neil, Mrs. W. R. Haight and Miss Marie B. Ames, who had been in\r\nJefferson City for ninety-six days working in the interest of the\r\nPresidential suffrage bill and had just returned with the joyful\r\ntidings that it had passed both Houses! The delegation was met at the\r\ndoor and escorted down the center aisle by Mrs. Gellhorn, holding\r\naloft a banner bearing the words, \"Now we are voters.\" The large\r\naudience rose spontaneously and amidst deafening cheers and wild\r\nwaving of handkerchiefs and hats the women ascended to the stage,\r\nwhere they were individually presented to the audience by the\r\npresiding officer, Dr. Shaw, who congratulated them and the rest of\r\nthe women of Missouri on the great victory. [Full account of\r\nconvention in Chapter XVIII, Volume V.]\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the success of this great convention and especially the\r\nwinning of Presidential suffrage, the St. Louis League at its annual\r\nmeeting in April gave a \"victory tea\" in the Statler Hotel. The guests\r\nof honor were Senator James W. McKnight and Representative Walter E.\r\nBailey, who had so successfully led the suffrage forces in the Senate\r\nand House. With music and the presentation to Mrs. O'Neil, in\r\nacknowledgment of her long and faithful services, of an illuminated\r\ntestimonial, it was a delightful afternoon. Mrs. Fred English was\r\nelected president of the league. At the State convention held at St.\r\nLouis Mrs. Gellhorn was elected president, Mrs. Miller honorary\r\npresident, Mrs. David O'Neil honorary vice-president of the\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\nWith Presidential suffrage won, the work before both State and city\r\nassociation was obviously the organization and education of the new\r\nvoters. At a State meeting held in Kansas City May 3, a \"budget\"\r\nsystem was adopted and a definite quota assigned to each county.\r\nKansas City raised $3,000 at a banquet in the Muehlbach Hotel, Mrs. J.\r\nB. White presiding. St. Louis then raised its quota of $6,000 and\r\nanother $6,000 was pro-rated throughout the remainder of the State,\r\ngiving $15,000.\r\n\r\nThe next step in order was the establishment of Citizenship Schools\r\nand the slogan \"Every Missouri Woman an Intelligent Voter in 1920\" was\r\nadopted. Under the direction of Mrs. Olive B. Swan, executive\r\nsecretary of the State association, citizenship schools were arranged\r\nfor in every one of the sixteen congressional districts. Miss Ames and\r\nMiss Lutie Stearns, two expert organizers, traveled through the State\r\nholding meetings and conducting schools. Mrs. Leighty and Mrs. Alfred\r\nBuschman assisted in this work. Mrs. English and Mrs. Clarke conducted\r\nall those in St. Louis. The Young Women's Christian Association\r\nallowed them the use of its auditorium for the first suffrage normal\r\nschool. Some mothers of families got up at five o'clock and did part\r\nof their day's work in order to be able to attend; some women traveled\r\nmiles in order to do so; others came to night classes after a hard\r\nday's work in office or school room. The St. Louis Board of Education\r\nrecognized the importance of this work and offered to incorporate the\r\ncitizenship schools in the night school system. It furnished the\r\nbuilding and paid the instructors, the St. Louis League managed the\r\nschools. The response of the colored women to these opportunities was\r\nespecially noteworthy; in one school over 300 were in constant\r\nattendance. Mrs. McBride, secretary of the Jackson county suffrage\r\nleague, conducted classes throughout the county. Kansas City secured\r\nProfessor Isador Loeb of the University of Missouri for a course of\r\nlectures on government. All the women's clubs united into one school.\r\nThe course included principles of government, organization, publicity,\r\npublic speaking, suffrage history and argument, parliamentary law and\r\nuse of literature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe submission of the Federal Suffrage Amendment by Congress in June,\r\n1919, was celebrated with the greatest joy throughout the State.\r\nProminent suffragists in St. Louis waited upon Mayor Keil, the board\r\nof aldermen and other city officials and escorted them in gaily\r\ndecorated automobiles to the steps of the Post Office, where the\r\nMayor, an old friend of woman suffrage, made a rousing speech. Mrs.\r\nMiller and Mrs. Gellhorn also spoke and Charles M. Hay closed the\r\nmeeting with an eloquent address. In Kansas City a similar meeting was\r\nheld in one of the large theaters.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. Steps were at once taken to secure the ratification of\r\nthe amendment by the Legislature. Edward F. Goltra, National\r\nDemocratic Committeeman, a proved friend, and Ben Neals, State\r\nDemocratic chairman, were often asked for advice and other help. Jacob\r\nBabler, Republican National Committeeman, and W. L. Cole, Republican\r\nState chairman, Mayor Keil and many others of both political parties\r\nassisted the suffrage associations in placing before Governor Gardner\r\nthe urgency of calling a special session. He was not slow in\r\nresponding and one was called for July 2, 1919. All the suffrage\r\norganizations in the State, with the Federated Clubs and the Woman's\r\nChristian Temperance Union, started to work immediately to make sure\r\nof a large majority. Legislators were visited by their constituents\r\nand letters and telegrams were showered on them by prominent men and\r\nwomen from other sections of the State.\r\n\r\nOn July 1 the suffragists gathered in Jefferson City and opened a\r\nState board meeting with a luncheon and speeches at the New Central\r\nHotel to which every one was welcome. At 7 o'clock the ratification\r\ndinner took place, with members of the Legislature as the invited\r\nguests of the State association. Every foot of space in the\r\ndining-room, ante-room and lobby of the hotel was filled with tables.\r\nThe Governor and Lieutenant Governor were escorted to the hall by\r\nprominent suffragists and both made stirring appeals.\r\n\r\nAt 10 o'clock the morning of July 3, a procession of women wended its\r\nway from the hotel to the beautiful new Capitol. The yellow parasols,\r\nwhich had figured in every suffrage celebration since the time of the\r\nhistoric Golden Lane in 1916, were everywhere in evidence and yellow\r\nbanners, ribbons and flowers gave the dominant note of color to the\r\nscene. The galleries in both Senate and House were filled. The\r\nresolution passed the House by a vote of 125 to 4; the Senate by a\r\nvote of 29 to 3.\r\n\r\nA great sorrow came in the midst of the rejoicing, as the news was\r\nreceived that Dr. Anna Howard Shaw died the evening before the\r\nratification. She had addressed the Legislature in other years and\r\nboth Houses passed resolutions of regret.\r\n\r\nMissouri women will forever remember gratefully the 50th General\r\nAssembly, as it did all possible for it to do toward their\r\nenfranchisement. It memorialized Congress urging the passage of the\r\nFederal Suffrage Amendment; it passed the Presidential suffrage bill\r\nand it promptly ratified the Amendment.\r\n\r\nA called convention of the State association was held October 16-18,\r\nat the Hotel Statler in St. Louis and the name was changed to the\r\nMissouri League of Women Voters. Mrs. Gellhorn was elected chairman.\r\nEvery district was represented by the 122 delegates present.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. 1913. A petition signed by 14,000 voters of the\r\nState, of whom 8,000 were from St. Louis, was presented to the\r\nLegislature asking it to submit an amendment for woman suffrage at the\r\nelection of 1914. The women who had had charge of the petition were\r\nMrs. David O'Neil, president, Miss Mary Bulkley, Miss Charlotte\r\nRumbold and Mrs. William C. Fordyce of the St. Louis Equal Suffrage\r\nLeague and Mrs. St. Clair Moss and Mrs. Rose Ingels of Columbia. A\r\nletter had been sent to every legislator saying that all he was asked\r\nto do was to help get the amendment before the voters. The resolution\r\nwas introduced by Representative Thomas J. Roney and Senator Anderson\r\nCraig. It was referred to the House and Senate Committees on\r\nConstitutional Amendment and a joint hearing was set for February 6.\r\nA number of women from different parts of the State appeared before\r\nthese committees and Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, president of the National\r\nSuffrage Association, disarmed all prejudice. There was a unanimous\r\nfavorable report from the Senate Committee and only one adverse vote\r\nin the House Committee. A week later the resolution was sent to\r\nengrossment by both Houses with but five dissenting votes in the\r\nSenate while in the House the \"ayes\" were so overwhelming that the\r\n\"noes\" were not counted. The women went home feeling that the fight\r\nwas won but the last week of the session the resolution was taken off\r\nthe calendar, referred back to the committees and pigeon-holed.\r\n\r\nThe women then decided to resort to the newly created device of the\r\n\"initiative petition,\" by which the amendment could be submitted\r\nwithout legislative action. Mrs. Walter McNab Miller was urged to take\r\ncharge of the work, the St. Louis Suffrage League agreeing to look\r\nafter the three most difficult congressional districts. She began the\r\nlatter part of August to canvass a State that has 114 counties, in\r\nmany of which there are no railroads and the other roads are almost\r\nimpassable. After six weeks of constant travel and hard work she\r\nobtained only 1,000 names. The cooperation of Mrs. Nellie Burger,\r\npresident of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, the only woman's\r\norganization in the State outside of the regular suffrage societies\r\nwhich had endorsed suffrage, was then secured. The St. Louis and\r\nKansas City leagues took the most thickly populated districts and the\r\nothers were apportioned among little bands of suffragists, who, under\r\nthe leadership of Mrs. Miller, worked steadily for the next six\r\nmonths. At last the required 14,000 signatures were obtained and\r\nrepresentatives from each district went to Jefferson City to present\r\nthe petitions to Secretary of State Cornelius Roach. He received them\r\nin a most friendly manner, saying that he hoped this work, which had\r\nbeen done at such great cost, would bring the desired reward.\r\n\r\nIt had only begun and the task during the next six months was to\r\ninduce the men to vote for the amendment, which now had an assured\r\nplace on the ballot. Help came from the outside, as well as within the\r\nState. Ruth Hanna (Mrs. Medill) McCormick of Chicago, chairman of the\r\nCongressional Committee of the National Association, sent an organizer\r\nand paid her expenses for four months. From friends outside $3,264\r\nwere sent and about $1,800 were raised in various ways in the State.\r\nDr. Shaw and Miss Jane Addams spoke in several cities and other\r\nprominent speakers were Mrs. Desha Breckinridge of Kentucky, Miss\r\nHelen Todd of California, Mrs. McCormick and \"General\" Rosalie Jones\r\nof New York. The State and county fairs were utilized. Headquarters\r\nwere rented in a big downtown building in St. Louis with Miss Rumbold\r\nas director of publicity, Miss Genevieve Tierney and Mrs. R. L.\r\nSanford in charge of the business part, Mrs. Alice Curtis Moyer-Wing\r\nhead of the speakers' bureau and Miss Bulkley treasurer. Mrs. Blair\r\nhad charge of the press work for the State, Miss Clara Sommerville for\r\nSt. Louis.[104] The St. Louis _Times_, the Kansas City _Post_ and the\r\nWarrensburg _Daily Star_ allowed the women to get out a special\r\nsuffrage edition.\r\n\r\nAll the hard work of a year and a half was in vain. On Nov. 3, 1914,\r\nthe woman suffrage amendment went down to defeat with fourteen other\r\namendments on the ballot. More votes were cast on this one than on any\r\nother--182,257 ayes; 322,463 noes; lost by 140,206. In Kansas City the\r\nadverse majority was only 1,000. Thirteen counties were carried.\r\n\r\n1915. It had been decided at the first State board meeting after the\r\ndefeat to attempt again to have an amendment submitted by the\r\nLegislature. Mrs. Miller took charge of the work and remained six\r\nweeks in Jefferson City. The resolution was written by Judge Robert\r\nFranklin Walker, now Chief Justice of Missouri, and was introduced by\r\nSenator Craig and Representative Roney, as before. A joint hearing was\r\narranged at which twelve Missouri women, representing various\r\nprofessions and occupations, spoke five minutes each. It passed the\r\nHouse by 88 ayes to 42 noes. Through the efforts of Senator William\r\nPhelps, who was showered with letters and telegrams from his\r\nconstituents, the committee, a majority of whom were violently\r\nopposed to woman suffrage, was persuaded to report it favorably but it\r\ndid not come to a vote in the Senate.\r\n\r\n1916. As the Federal Amendment was now well advanced and the bad\r\neffect on it of the loss of a State campaign was clearly recognized,\r\nthe National Board asked the officers of each State association to\r\nrefrain from entering into one. Therefore it was agreed at the State\r\nconvention in May, 1916, to give up the projected campaign.\r\n\r\n1917. A bill for Presidential suffrage, which was approved by the\r\nnational officers, was introduced. Headquarters were opened in the\r\nCapitol with Miss Geraldine Buchanan of California, Mo., in charge and\r\na strong lobby of State women remained there during the session--Mrs.\r\nLeighty, Mrs. Fordyce, Mrs. O'Neil, Mrs. Passmore and Mrs. Grossman of\r\nSt. Louis. Mrs. Katherine Smith, daughter of Judge Walker, and Miss\r\nMatilda Dahlmeyer of Jefferson City gave effective aid. Percy Werner,\r\na lawyer of St. Louis, agreed to defend its legal status before the\r\nLegislature if necessary and in January it was introduced by Senator\r\nRobert J. Mitchell of Aurora and Representative Nick Cave of Fulton.\r\nIt was reported favorably by the House Committee but when it came to a\r\nhearing before the Senate committee there appeared Miss Minnie Bronson\r\nfrom New York, secretary of the National Anti-Suffrage Association.\r\nThe speaker in favor was Mrs. Fordyce, a granddaughter of the pioneer\r\nsuffragist, Mrs. Beverly Allen. The House passed it by 87 to 37 but\r\nthe Senate defeated it.\r\n\r\nMissouri women now turned their attention to furthering the Federal\r\nSuffrage Amendment. The Congressional Committee appointed for this\r\npurpose worked indefatigably and early in January, armed with two\r\nlarge bundles of petitions for it, one from the State and one from St.\r\nLouis, aggregating 75,000 names, a delegation went to Washington. Mrs.\r\nMiller, vice-president of the National Association, arranged, with the\r\nassistance of Miss Mabel Stone, daughter of the Missouri Senator,\r\nWilliam R. Stone, for a meeting in his office between them and the\r\nState's members of Congress. They presented their petitions and made\r\nearnest appeals for the amendment.\r\n\r\nSuffragists throughout the State kept up a constant stream of\r\ntelegrams and letters to the Missouri members and Governor Gardner\r\nused his influence. Senator Stone, and after his death Senator\r\nXenophon P. Wilfley, were pledged to the amendment, and Senator Selden\r\nP. Spencer, who later was elected, could positively be depended upon.\r\nAll possible efforts were concentrated upon Senator James A. Reed but\r\nto no avail. To disprove his statements that his constituents were not\r\nin favor of woman suffrage, the Jackson county campaign committee,\r\nwith Mrs. J. B. White of Kansas City chairman, sent him the signatures\r\nof 47,382 women and 12,583 men from his district, asking for it. When\r\nthe amendment came to a vote in 1918, Senator Wilfley and all the\r\nRepresentatives voted in the affirmative except Meeker of St. Louis,\r\nwho died soon afterwards. In 1919 Senator Spencer and the entire\r\ndelegation in the House voted in favor. Senator Reed fought it every\r\ntime it came before the Senate.\r\n\r\nDelegations of women appeared before the State conventions of both\r\nparties on the same day in August, 1918, and asked for a suffrage\r\nplank. Mrs. Miller, Mrs. O'Neil and Mrs. Stix attended the Democratic\r\nconvention in Jefferson City; Mrs. Gellhorn and Mrs. Grossman,\r\nassisted by others, looked after the Republican convention in St.\r\nLouis. They were invited to speak and each party put a very good\r\nsuffrage plank in its platform.\r\n\r\n1919. Work for Presidential suffrage was continued. Extra pressure was\r\nbrought to bear on the Senate. Two national organizers, Miss Ames and\r\nMiss Alma Sasse, were sent into various senatorial districts to enlist\r\nthe help of influential people and when the time came for a vote it\r\nundoubtedly was favorable pressure from home that kept some of the\r\nSenators in line. When the General Assembly convened Jan. 8, 1919,\r\nGovernor Gardner recommended such suffrage legislation as the women\r\nmight desire. Through the courtesy of Lieutenant Governor Crossley,\r\nPresident of the Senate, and S. F. O'Fallon, Speaker of the House, it\r\nwas the first bill introduced.\r\n\r\nOn February 6 the Presidential bill was put on the calendar over the\r\nadverse report of the Election Committee, an action almost without\r\nprecedent. On the 11th the Speaker left the chair and delivered a\r\npowerful address urging its passage. Representative Frank Farris also\r\nmade a strong speech in its favor and the final vote was 122 ayes, 8\r\nnoes. The opposition used every device to prevent it from being\r\nbrought up for the final reading in the Senate but finally the time\r\nwas set for March 28. On that date two of the Senators favoring it\r\nwere absent and their votes were absolutely necessary. Senator David\r\nW. Stark was at his home in Westline and Senator Howard Gray had been\r\ncalled on important business to Caruthersville. On the 27th Mrs.\r\nMiller, Mrs. O'Neil, Mrs. Haight and Miss Ames, who had been in\r\nJefferson City for over three months, met for final consultation.\r\nSenator Stark responded to a telephone call and promised to be in his\r\nseat the next morning. It was found it would be impossible for Senator\r\nGray to arrive on time. They were in despair but a savior was at hand.\r\nDemocratic National Committeeman Edward F. Goltra offered to charter a\r\nspecial train to bring Senator Gray, a Republican, to Jefferson City\r\nin time to cast his vote. This offer was gladly and gratefully\r\naccepted and the Senator left Caruthersville that night. The next\r\nmorning all the other Senators were in their seats, the opposition\r\ncomplacent and confident that the bill could not pass. While Senator\r\nMcKnight was reading a telegram from the National Suffrage Convention\r\nin session at St. Louis urging the immediate passage of the\r\nPresidential suffrage bill Senator Gray quietly walked in and took his\r\nseat! The opposition, out-witted and out-generaled, threw up their\r\nhands and the bill was passed by a vote of 21 to 12, some of its\r\nformer opponents voting for it. On April 5 in the presence of the\r\nboard of the State association it was signed by Governor Gardner.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[102] The History is indebted for this chapter to Miss Marie R.\r\nGaresche, a founder and first vice-president of the St. Louis Equal\r\nSuffrage League.\r\n\r\n[103] Thirteen men were enrolled this year, Eugene Angert, George\r\nBlackman, R. W. Boysselier, Dr. W. W. Boyd, Mr. Chauvenet, E. M.\r\nGrossman, Charles Haanel, Stephen Hart, Charles Van Dyke Hill, Dr.\r\nJohn C. Morfit, H. J. Peifer, Judge R. E. Rombauer and Percy Werner.\r\n\r\n[104] Because of lack of space it has been impossible to include the\r\nlong lists of names prepared of women who worked all over the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nMONTANA.[105]\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore 1900 the National American Woman Suffrage Association, under\r\nthe presidency of Miss Susan B. Anthony, helped to organize suffrage\r\nsocieties in Montana and several conventions were held. In 1899 Dr.\r\nMaria M. Dean was elected president. She was succeeded by Mrs. Clara\r\nB. Tower, whose report to the national suffrage convention of 1903\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     On May 1, 1902, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, National president,\r\n     Miss Gail Laughlin and Miss Laura A. Gregg, organizers, arrived\r\n     in Helena and in conjunction with the State officers planned a\r\n     campaign to include a meeting in every town of any importance.\r\n     Mrs. Catt re-organized the Helena Suffrage Club and remained two\r\n     weeks, conducting a large correspondence, addressing all the\r\n     women's organizations in the city and a mass meeting. Miss\r\n     Laughlin spent these two weeks in Butte, where she spoke to a\r\n     number of labor unions and obtained resolutions strongly\r\n     endorsing woman suffrage from the Silver Bow Trades and Labor\r\n     Assembly, a delegate body representing 10,000 men. Mrs. Catt then\r\n     went to Butte and for ten days she and Miss Laughlin delivered\r\n     addresses before the principal organizations of the city, among\r\n     which were the Woman's Club and the Trades Council. Their visit\r\n     closed with a mass meeting at which a large number of names were\r\n     secured for membership in the Equal Suffrage Club, which was\r\n     organized immediately afterward. The campaign was then placed in\r\n     charge of Miss Laughlin, who did the field work, and Miss Gregg,\r\n     who arranged the dates from the headquarters in Helena. The\r\n     speaking before labor unions was continued through the State and\r\n     not a union or delegate body of laboring men failed to endorse\r\n     woman suffrage. Miss Laughlin, by invitation, addressed the State\r\n     labor convention, representing all the labor unions, and\r\n     resolutions strongly endorsing woman suffrage and the submission\r\n     of an amendment were passed with only one dissenting voice on a\r\n     roll-call vote.\r\n\r\n     Miss Laughlin spent the summer and fall visiting every town of\r\n     importance, organizing more than thirty clubs, and securing\r\n     committees to circulate petitions where organization was\r\n     impracticable. The State convention was held in Butte in\r\n     September in preparation for work in the Legislature during\r\n     January and February, 1903, for submission to the voters of a\r\n     woman suffrage amendment to the State constitution, which had\r\n     been strongly recommended by Governor Toole in his Message. A\r\n     considerable sum was raised for press work and Miss Mary E.\r\n     O'Neill was appointed superintendent. A resolution asking the\r\n     National Association for the services of Miss Laughlin for\r\n     legislative work was adopted and she remained.[106]\r\n\r\nThe bill for full suffrage was introduced in both Houses; public\r\nhearings were granted by the Judiciary Committee of each and the House\r\ntook a recess that its members might attend in a body. Miss Laughlin\r\nand others spoke and the measure had strong advocates in Dr. O. M.\r\nLanstrum, J. M. Kennedy, John Maginness, Colonel James U. Sanders, F.\r\nAugustus Heinze (the copper magnate), Colonel C. B. Nolan, State\r\nSenators Whipple, Myers and Johnson. State officers and members of the\r\nHelena Club assisted in the legislative work, which continued two\r\nmonths. The vote in the House was 41 ayes, 23 noes, but two-thirds\r\nwere necessary. The resolution introduced in the Senate by H. L.\r\nSherlock was also defeated.\r\n\r\nAt the session of 1905 the amendment resolution was again introduced\r\nand Mrs. Tower travelled from Boston to be present at the hearing.\r\nMrs. J. M. Lewis, Mrs. Walter Matheson and Miss O'Neill addressed the\r\ncommittees but the vote was adverse.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years little was done except in a desultory way. The\r\nsuffrage resolution was presented at almost every session of the\r\nLegislature but there was no intensive work for it. Some of the\r\npolitical equality clubs lived on, the strongest one in Missoula with\r\nJ. Washington McCormick president and Miss Jeannette Rankin\r\nvice-president. In 1911 Dr. J. M. Donahue had introduced the suffrage\r\nresolution in the Legislature but no work had been done for it and\r\nthis club sent Miss Rankin to Helena to press for its passage. It\r\nfound champions in Colonel J. B. Nolan, W. W. Berry and D. G. O'Shea\r\nand opponents in James E. McNally and Joseph Binnard. Miss Rankin\r\nobtained permission to address the House. The Senate refused to\r\nattend officially but adjourned and was present almost in a body.\r\nHouse members brought flowers and the room resembled anything but a\r\nlegislative hall, as masses of hats hid the legislators and people\r\nwere banked in the doorways. Miss Rankin was escorted to the reading\r\ndesk by a number of old-time suffragists, Dr. Dean, Dr. Atwater, Mrs.\r\nSanders, Mrs. Mary Long Alderson and Miss May Murphy. As\r\nRepresentative Binnard was the strongest opponent he was delegated by\r\nthe members to present Miss Rankin with a corsage bouquet of violets.\r\nHe made a flowery speech and attempted to turn the meeting into a\r\nfacetious affair but when Miss Rankin spoke his purpose was defeated\r\nand she received much applause. The bill was, however, reported out of\r\nthe committee without recommendation and neither House took any\r\naction.\r\n\r\nAt the State Fairs of 1911 and 1912 the suffragists erected attractive\r\nbooths, giving out suffrage literature and buttons to all passers-by.\r\nThey were in charge of Ida Auerbach, Frieda Fligelman and Grace Rankin\r\nKinney. In 1912 a State Central Committee was formed with Miss Rankin\r\nas temporary chairman and Miss Auerbach as temporary secretary. Later\r\nMrs. Grace Smith was made treasurer. The first meeting was called in\r\nthe studio of Miss Mary C. Wheeler of Helena. These women attended the\r\nState conventions of the Republican, Democratic and Progressive\r\nparties and succeeded in getting planks in their platforms for a\r\nsuffrage amendment to the State constitution. Then all nominees were\r\ncircularized and asked to stand by their party platforms. Miss Rankin\r\nwent over the State quietly, stopping in every county seat and\r\nsearching out women willing to work. She secured the consent of Thomas\r\nStout to introduce the bill at the next session.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1913, the women met in Helena and formed a permanent State\r\norganization, electing the following officers: Chairman, Miss Rankin,\r\nMissoula; assistant chairmen, Mrs. Louis P. Sanders, Butte; Mrs. G. M.\r\nGillmore, Glendive; secretary, Mrs. Harvey Coit, Big Timber;\r\ntreasurer, Mrs. Wilbur L. Smith, Helena; finance chairman, Mrs.\r\nWallace Perham, Glendive; press chairman, Miss Auerbach. The\r\norganization never had any constitution or by-laws. Letters from all\r\nover the State were written to Governor S. V. Stewart and on January\r\n7 the women went in a body to hear his Message, in which he\r\nrecommended that Montana women should be enfranchised. With no\r\ndiscussion the resolution to submit an amendment to the voters passed\r\nthe Senate by 26 ayes, two noes--J. E. Edwards and I. A. Leighton--and\r\nwas signed by the president, Lieutenant Governor W. W. McDowell, in\r\nopen session. In the House the vote was 74 ayes, two noes--Ronald\r\nHiggins and John W. Blair. On January 25 it was signed by the\r\nGovernor.\r\n\r\nOn June 27 the second meeting of the State Central Committee was held\r\nin Livingston, immediately following that of the State Federation of\r\nWomen's Clubs. Great progress in interest and organization was\r\nreported from all parts of the State. The only new officers elected\r\nwere: Recording secretary, Mrs. John Willis of Glasgow; chairman of\r\nliterature, Miss Mary Agnes Cantwell of Hunters' Hot Springs. Chairmen\r\nwere appointed in each county and workers were sent into every\r\nprecinct. The third meeting of the Central Committee was held in Butte\r\nSeptember 22, 23, just before the State Fair, where it had a booth. It\r\nwas decided to open headquarters in Butte Feb. 1, 1914.\r\n\r\nThe fourth meeting was held in Big Timber February 14 and the fifth in\r\nLewiston June 6. Miss O'Neill was made assistant chairman and press\r\nchairman; Mrs. Edith Clinch, treasurer; Miss Eloise Knowles chairman\r\nof literature.\r\n\r\nHeadquarters were opened in Butte in January, 1914. Letters were sent\r\nto granges, labor unions, women's clubs and other organizations asking\r\nthem to pass resolutions in favor of the amendment and aid the\r\ncampaign as far as they could. Every newspaper in the State received\r\neach week a letter of suffrage news and items from Miss O'Neill and\r\noccasionally some propaganda material. Letters were sent regularly to\r\nthe county chairmen and other workers giving instructions and keeping\r\nthem in touch with the campaign. Large quantities of literature were\r\ndistributed with many leaflets for special occasions. A short time\r\nbefore election personal letters and a leaflet especially for farmers\r\nwere sent to 20,000 voters in the country districts. The\r\nhouse-to-house canvass of the women in the towns and cities was the\r\nmost effective work done. Montana women spoke in every county and\r\nwomen from outside the State in all but a few of the smaller ones.\r\n\r\nIn the spring Mr. and Mrs. James Lees Laidlaw of New York City stopped\r\noff en route to California and spoke in a number of places. The women\r\nwere charmed with her beauty and style and some men who had considered\r\nthe movement as only carried on by women were surprised that a man of\r\nMr. Laidlaw's standing should be at the head of a National Men's\r\nSuffrage League. He organized a Montana branch of it with Wellington\r\nD. Rankin (now Attorney General) as president.\r\n\r\nMiss Rankin in her report to the national suffrage convention of\r\nNovember 12-17, expressed the highest appreciation of the women who\r\ncame into Montana, either sent by the National Association or at their\r\nown expense, and campaigned for weeks under the instructions of the\r\nState board. They were headed by Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, the national\r\npresident, and included Miss Katharine Devereux Blake, Miss Ida Craft\r\nand Miss Rosalie Jones of New York; Mrs. Antoinette Funk, Miss Jane\r\nThompson, Miss Gratia Erickson and Miss Florence Lord of Chicago; Mrs.\r\nRoot of Los Angeles. During May and June Mrs. Cotterill of Seattle,\r\nand during July and August Miss Margaret Hinchey of Boston, gave their\r\ntime to labor unions. A number of large demonstrations were held in\r\nvarious cities. Campaigning in a State of such distances and\r\ngeographical formation presented great difficulties.\r\n\r\nA precinct organization was perfected wherever possible but to the\r\nfar-off places word was simply sent to the women to work to get votes\r\nfor the amendment and they did so with splendid results. The usual\r\nprogram of party campaigning in rural districts was adopted of holding\r\na rally followed by a dance. Miss Rankin, Miss Fligelman, Miss Grace\r\nHellmick, Mrs. Maggie Smith Hathaway, Miss O'Neill, Dr. Dean, Mrs.\r\nTopping and many other volunteer speakers went into every little\r\nmining camp and settlement that could be reached. They spoke from the\r\nsteps of the store and the audience, composed entirely of men, would\r\nlisten in respectful silence, applaud a little at the close, too shy\r\nto ask questions, but on election day every vote was for suffrage. Old\r\nprospectors back in the mountains when approached and asked for their\r\nvotes would say: \"Do you ladies really want to vote? Well, if you do,\r\nwe'll sure help all we can.\" Many old-timers said: \"What would our\r\nState have been without the women? You bet you can count on us.\" The\r\ncampaigners spoke in moving picture theaters, from wagons and\r\nautomobiles and wherever they could obtain an audience however small.\r\nThere were no rebuffs but some of the Southerners would say that it\r\nwould be a bad thing for the South. All these outlying districts that\r\ncould be reached gave a favorable majority. The money for the campaign\r\nwas raised in many ways, by donations, food sales, dances,\r\ncollections, the sale of suffrage papers on the street, etc. The loss\r\nof the funds collected for the campaign through the closing of the\r\nState bank was a heavy blow and it could not have succeeded without\r\nthe help of the National Association and friends in outside States.\r\nThe campaign cost about $9,000, of which over half was contributed by\r\nthe association and other States.\r\n\r\nTo the women specifically mentioned the names of the following\r\nespecially active in the campaign should be added: Miss Mary Stewart,\r\nMrs. W. I. Higgins, Mrs. J. F. Kilduff, Mrs. Tyler Thompson, Jean\r\nBishop, Mrs. Wm. Roza, Mrs. J. W. Scott, Mrs. John Duff, Mrs. Bertha\r\nRosenberg, Mrs. Mary Tocher, Mrs. J. M. Darroch, Mrs. W. E. Cummings,\r\nMrs. Stevens, Mrs. A. E. Richardson, Mrs. Frank D. O'Neill, Mrs. J. B.\r\nEllis, Mrs. M. E. Hughes, Mrs. Delia Peets, Mrs. C. P. Irish, Mrs. J.\r\nR. E. Sievers, Mrs. A. P. Rooney, Mrs. Sarah M. Souders, Mrs.\r\nSherrill, Mrs. Nathan Lloyd, Mrs. Burt Addams Tower, Mrs. Mary Meigs\r\nAtwater, Mrs. Helen Fitzgerald Sanders, Mrs. Charles N. Skillman, Mrs.\r\nCharles S. Haire, Mrs. J. M. Lewis, Mrs. H. W. Child, Miss Susan\r\nHiggins. Among the men the best friends besides those already\r\nmentioned were Miles Romney, Joseph H. Griffin, Lewis J. Duncan, W. W.\r\nMcDowell, Lieutenant Governor, and the two U. S. Senators, Thomas J.\r\nWalsh and Henry L. Myers.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the campaign a travelling organizer of the\r\nNational Anti-Suffrage Association came to Butte, and, saying that she\r\nacted officially, had an interview with the editors of the _National\r\nForum_, the organ of the liquor interests. She told them their open\r\nopposition was helping the amendment, urged them to carry it on in\r\nsecret and said she would return later and lay before them a plan of\r\ncampaign. Afterwards when the Butte papers exposed this scheme the\r\n_National Forum_ described the interview. Before the election the\r\nNational Anti-Suffrage Association sent its executive secretary, Miss\r\nMinnie Bronson, and Mrs. J. D. Oliphant of New Jersey to campaign\r\nagainst the amendment. They succeeded in forming only one society in\r\nthe State and that was at Butte, with a branch in the little town of\r\nChinook. The officers were Mrs. John Noyes, president; Mrs. Theodore\r\nSymons, secretary; Mrs. W. J. Chrystie, press chairman; Mrs. David\r\nNixon, active worker; Mrs. Oliphant challenged Miss Rankin to a\r\ndebate, which was held in the old auditorium in Helena. At the\r\nmeeting, which had been packed by the liquor interests, Mrs. Oliphant\r\nwas noisily applauded and the confusion was appalling.\r\n\r\nAlthough the speakers travelled to remote districts up to the night\r\nbefore election in November, the instructions from headquarters were\r\nto have loose ends gathered up by the opening of the State Fair\r\nSeptember 25, at Helena. Headquarters were maintained a week at the\r\nfair and in the city and each day _The Suffrage Daily_ was issued. The\r\neditors were Mrs. L. O. Edmunds, Miss O'Neill, Mrs. M. E. McKay and\r\nMiss Belle Fligelman, all newspaper women. The most picturesque and\r\neducative feature of the whole campaign and the greatest awakener was\r\nthe enormous suffrage parade which took place one evening during the\r\nweek. Thousands of men and women from all parts of the State marched,\r\nDr. Anna Howard Shaw was at the head, and next, carrying banners, came\r\nDr. Dean, the past president, and Miss Rankin, the present State\r\nchairman. A huge American flag was carried by women representing\r\nStates having full suffrage; a yellow one for the States now having\r\ncampaigns; a large gray banner for the partial suffrage States and a\r\nblack banner for the non-suffrage States. Each county and city in the\r\nState had its banner. The Men's League marched and there were as many\r\nmen as women in the parade.\r\n\r\nDuring the entire campaign the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, one\r\nof the strongest organizations in the State, conducted a vigorous\r\nfight for the amendment, sending its speakers to every locality. For\r\nmany years it had worked for woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nAt the election Nov. 3, 1914, the amendment received 41,302 ayes;\r\n37,588 noes, a majority of 3,714, and women were enfranchised on equal\r\nterms with men.\r\n\r\nThe various suffrage societies merged into Good Government Clubs with\r\nthe avowed purpose of obtaining political action on many needed\r\nmeasures. The next year they secured mother's pension and equal\r\nguardianship laws, and others equally important in following years.\r\nThe Executive Committee continued in existence and directed the work.\r\nAt its meeting in 1916 it was decided to conduct an intensive campaign\r\nfor prohibition in 1917; to elect a woman to Congress and a woman\r\nState Superintendent of Schools. Prohibition was carried; Miss\r\nJeannette Rankin was elected the first Congresswoman in the United\r\nStates and Miss May Trumper was elected Superintendent of Schools.\r\nThat year an eight-hour-day for women was secured. This record was\r\ncontinued. Mrs. Maggie Smith Hathaway and Mrs. Emma A. Ingalls have\r\nserved two terms each as State Representatives. All the county\r\nsuperintendents of schools are women.\r\n\r\nAfter the Federal Amendment was submitted by Congress the societies\r\nmet on June 22, 1919, and formed a State branch of the National League\r\nof Women Voters with Mrs. Edwin L. Norris chairman.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. Governor Samuel V. Stewart called a special session of\r\nthe Legislature to meet in August, 1920, and the Federal Suffrage\r\nAmendment was ratified on the 2nd by unanimous vote in the House and\r\nby 38 to one in the Senate--Claude F. Morris of Havre, Hill county.\r\nThe resolution was introduced in the House by Mrs. Ingalls.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[105] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Lucile Dyas\r\nTopping, formerly Lewis and Clark county superintendent of schools and\r\nprominent in the work of the campaign of 1914, when Montana women\r\nobtained the suffrage.\r\n\r\n[106] In the intensive work that followed, Mrs. Tower was assisted by\r\nDr. Dean, Mrs. Ellen Maria Dean, Mrs. James U. Sanders, Mrs. T. J.\r\nWalsh, Mrs. Bessie Hughes Smith, Mrs. Martha Dunkel, Mrs. Ella Knowles\r\nHaskell, Mrs. Adelaide Staves Reeder, Dr. Bertha Mackal McCleman, Mrs.\r\nC. B. Nolan, Mrs. Donald Bradford, Madame F. Rowena Medini, Miss\r\nSarepta Sanders, Dr. Mary B. Atwater, Mrs. H. L. Sherlock, Mrs. Hughes\r\nand Miss Mary C. Wheeler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nNEBRASKA.[107]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe History of the movement for woman suffrage in Nebraska from 1900\r\nto 1920 naturally divides itself into three periods. The first period\r\nextends from 1900 to 1912. During those years the organization was\r\nsupported by a small but faithful group whose continuous effort at\r\neducating public sentiment prepared the way for the work that\r\nfollowed. The second period included the years from 1912 to 1915,\r\nduring which time a campaign for full suffrage by an amendment to the\r\nState constitution was carried on. The third period from 1915 to 1920\r\nwas marked by the passage of a partial suffrage law in 1917, which was\r\nan issue during the preceding two years; an attack on that law through\r\nthe initiative and referendum; the successful defense of it by the\r\nState Suffrage Association and the ratification of the Federal\r\nAmendment at a special session in 1919, which marked the end of a long\r\ncontest.\r\n\r\nMiss Laura Gregg, a Nebraska woman, was put in charge of the State\r\nsuffrage headquarters at Omaha in October, 1899, by Mrs. Carrie\r\nChapman Catt, chairman of the Organization Committee of the National\r\nAmerican Suffrage Association, and remained four years. During that\r\ntime conventions and conferences were held, much field work was done\r\nand the membership was increased to nearly 1,200. At the annual\r\nconvention at Blair in October, 1900, Mrs. Catt, now national\r\npresident, was present. Mrs. Clara A. Young of Broken Bow was elected\r\nState president, relieving Mrs. Mary Smith Hayward of Chadron, who had\r\npressing business obligations. Her section of the State, however,\r\nremained one of the suffrage strongholds and she was always one of the\r\nlargest contributors. Other officers elected were, vice-president,\r\nMrs. Amanda J. Marble of Broken Bow; corresponding secretary, Miss\r\nNelly Taylor of Merna; recording secretary, Mrs. Ida L. Denny of\r\nLincoln.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 the State convention was held in Lincoln November 12-14,\r\nwelcomed by Mayor T. C. Winnett. A reception was given at the Lindell\r\nHotel to the fifty-six delegates and Mrs. Catt, who had spent sixteen\r\ndays in the State, attending conferences in Omaha and eleven other\r\nplaces. An address by Governor E. P. Savage, one by Mrs. Catt, and a\r\ndebate between Miss Gregg and A. L. Bixby, editor of the _State\r\nJournal_, who took the negative, were the evening attractions. There\r\nwas a work conference led by Mrs. Catt and reports were given by the\r\nofficers and by State workers, including Mrs. Maria C. Arter of\r\nLincoln; Mrs. K. W. Sutherland of Blair, Miss Taylor, Mrs. Mary G.\r\nWard of Tecumseh, Mrs. Jennie Ross of Dakota City, Mrs. Hetty W. Drury\r\nof Pender, with a \"question box\" conducted by Mrs. Catt. The next\r\nafternoon the speakers in a symposium were Mrs. Anna A. Wells of\r\nSchuyler, J. H. Dundas of the _Auburn Granger_, Mrs. Emma Shuman of\r\nNebraska City, Mrs. Rosa Modlin of Beaver City, Mrs. C. W. Damon of\r\nOmaha, Mrs. Mary E. Jeffords of Broken Bow, Mrs. Alice Isabel Brayton\r\nof Geneva and Mrs. Belle Sears of Tekamah.\r\n\r\nThe sum of $1,312 had been expended during the year, including the\r\ncost of headquarters and field work. Pledges to the amount of $1,000\r\nwere made for the next year. The large dailies of Omaha and Lincoln\r\nhad given much attention to the subject of woman suffrage and over 150\r\nweeklies had published matter furnished by the press departments. Mrs.\r\nYoung, Mrs. Marble, Miss Taylor and Mrs. Denny were re-elected; other\r\nofficers were: Treasurer, Mrs. Mary E. Dempster, Omaha; first auditor,\r\nMrs. Hayward, second, Mrs. Sears; press chairman, Mrs. Lucie B. Meriom\r\nof Beaver City.\r\n\r\nThis convention was a type of those held during the next three or four\r\nyears. County conventions were frequent and local clubs were active. A\r\nsmall printed sheet called the _Headquarters Message_, edited by Miss\r\nGregg, filled with State suffrage news, club reports, National\r\nrecommendations, etc., was sent monthly to the workers. During the\r\nspring of 1902 Miss Gail Laughlin, a national organizer, spent two\r\nweeks organizing new clubs and arousing old ones and Miss Gregg and\r\nMr. Bixby debated in towns in eastern Nebraska. A series of parlor\r\nmeetings in Omaha increased the interest there. Mrs. Marble was\r\nchairman of the Committee on Assemblies and during the summer the\r\nsuffrage question was presented at the State Fair, the Epworth\r\nAssembly, Chautauquas, pioneer picnics and other gatherings. The\r\ncommittee included later Mrs. O. B. Bowers, Tekamah; Mrs. Ellen A.\r\nMiller, Beatrice; Mrs. Ollie King Carriker, Nebraska City; Mrs. Anna\r\nPickett, Broken Bow. Miss Gregg spent the autumn in field work\r\nthroughout the State. The annual convention was held at Tecumseh\r\nDecember 1-3, with a large attendance. The program included the Mayor,\r\nGovernor-elect J. H. Mickey, the Hon. C. W. Beal, Senator O'Neill, and\r\nother prominent citizens. A memorial hour was given to Elizabeth Cady\r\nStanton and to Nebraska suffragists who had died during the year. It\r\nwas resolved to push press work, county organization, new memberships\r\nand work before assemblies.\r\n\r\nIn 1903 branch headquarters were established at the Lindell Hotel,\r\nLincoln, for work with the Legislature. The delegates to the national\r\nconvention in New Orleans in March were accompanied home by Miss\r\nLaughlin for organizing work. Assisted most of the time by Miss Gregg\r\nshe visited thirty-five cities and towns, speaking from one to three\r\ntimes in each place, gained 403 new members and collected about $200.\r\nShe spoke at five Normal Schools during the summer and had\r\nheadquarters at the Northwest G. A. R. encampment and several\r\nChautauquas. The State convention was held at Nebraska City, October\r\n6-8. The program was enriched by the address of Dr. Anna Howard Shaw,\r\nnational vice-president, on The Fate of Republics. Miss Laughlin made\r\na strong speech and there were many new names on the program. To the\r\nprevious plan of work had been added suffrage contests, literature in\r\nlibraries and church work; the peace and industrial work of the\r\nNational Association had been endorsed and committees formed.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1904, Miss Gregg was sent by Mrs. Catt to Oklahoma, where\r\nher services as organizer were very much needed. The State\r\nheadquarters were transferred to Tecumseh with the secretary, Mrs.\r\nMary G. Ward, in charge. Mrs. Young edited the _Headquarters Message_\r\nand Mrs. Myrtle W. Marble of Humboldt attended to the publishing and\r\nmailing. A Suffrage Cook Book was prepared and published and became a\r\nsource of considerable revenue. Mrs. Lulu S. Halvorsen of Nebraska\r\nCity was press chairman. Miss Laughlin spent a month speaking and\r\norganizing. The State convention was held at Geneva November\r\n21-December 1, Mrs. Ellis Meredith of Denver a principal evening\r\nspeaker. With the withdrawal of Miss Gregg and the conviction that no\r\namendment of any kind could be carried under the existing law, the\r\ninterest of the local organizations began to decline and the two brave\r\nand faithful women who had carried the heaviest part of the burden\r\nwere now finding it too heavy for their strength. Mrs. Young took the\r\nheadquarters to her own home in Broken Bow and Mrs. Marble did all\r\nkinds of work at all times if it helped the cause.\r\n\r\nMrs. Young kept the clubs at work during 1905 and a full delegation of\r\nfourteen was sent to the national convention at Portland, Oregon, but\r\nher health began to fail and at the State convention held at Broken\r\nBow October 10-12 she was compelled to give up the presidency. The\r\nexecutive board needed her counsel and experience and she accepted the\r\nposition of honorary president. Mrs. Marble was made president and the\r\nother officers were re-elected with Miss Mary H. Williams as\r\nhistorian. Mrs. Mary C. C. Bradford of Colorado was the principal\r\nspeaker. There were seventeen addresses of welcome from representative\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nMrs. Marble kept up the work in 1906 as far as it was possible. She\r\nbegan publishing an annual report of the year's work, a pamphlet of\r\nabout 70 pages, containing a roster of the clubs and much useful\r\ninformation, and continued it during the four years of her presidency.\r\nWith Miss Williams she attended the national convention at Baltimore.\r\nThe State convention met at Lincoln, October 2, 3, in All Souls'\r\nChurch with Dr. Shaw as evening speaker. A memorial meeting was held\r\nfor Susan B. Anthony, with the Rev. Newton Mann of Omaha, her former\r\npastor in Rochester, N. Y., as speaker.\r\n\r\nThe State convention of 1907 met in Kenesaw October 1, 2. The\r\nlegislative work had been to obtain a memorial to Congress asking for\r\na Federal Suffrage Amendment. More conventions passed woman suffrage\r\nresolutions during the summer than ever before. On October 7 the\r\nbeloved leader, Mrs. Young, passed away. In November Miss Gregg was\r\nsent by the National Association to assist Mrs. Marble and remained\r\nuntil the middle of January, doing office and field work.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1908, Mrs. Maud Wood Park of Boston made a visit to the\r\nState and formed College Woman Suffrage Leagues in the State and\r\nWesleyan Universities and among graduates in Lincoln. Miss Williams\r\nwas made chairman of a committee to raise Nebraska's pledge of $300 to\r\nthe Anthony Memorial Fund. At the State convention in Lincoln Nov. 5,\r\n6, Mrs. Marble was obliged to decline the presidency and was made\r\nvice-president. The Rev. Mary G. Andrews of Omaha was elected in her\r\nplace; but from this time until her death, April 6, 1910, Mrs. Marble\r\nnever ceased to do everything in her power to forward the success of\r\nthe suffrage movement.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1909 the petition of the National Association to Congress for\r\nan amendment of the Federal Constitution was begun with Miss Williams\r\nchairman of the committee and 10,386 signatures were secured. Mrs.\r\nPhilip Snowden of England lectured in Lincoln during the session of\r\nthe Legislature and many of the members heard her. The annual\r\nconvention was held in Lincoln November 18, 19. Mrs. Andrews had gone\r\nto Minneapolis and Dr. Inez Philbrick of Lincoln was elected\r\npresident. A lecture tour was arranged for Dr. B. O. Aylesworth of\r\nDenver for the autumn of 1909 and again in 1910; Men's Suffrage\r\nLeagues were organized in Omaha and Lincoln and many new clubs formed\r\nof people of influence. The convention was postponed to March, 1911.\r\nThe regular convention of 1911 was held in Lincoln November 20-22.\r\nMrs. Emmeline Pankhurst was the speaker and the audience filled the\r\nlargest assembly room.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1912 met in Omaha December 4-6, and it was decided\r\nto go into an active campaign to secure the submission of a\r\nconstitutional amendment by petition in 1914. The Initiative and\r\nReferendum Law had been adopted the preceding month, which required\r\nthe signature of 15 per cent. of the total vote cast at the last\r\nelection, the signers coming from two-fifths of the counties. This\r\nmeant 37,752 names from thirty-eight counties. Nebraska has\r\nninety-three counties and an area of 77,520 square miles. Officers\r\nelected to serve throughout the campaign were: Henrietta I. (Mrs.\r\nDraper) Smith, president; Mrs. Kovanda, vice-president; Miss Williams,\r\ncorresponding secretary; Miss Daisy Doane, recording secretary;\r\nGertrude Law (Mrs. W. E.) Hardy, treasurer; Mrs. Grace M. Wheeler,\r\nfirst and Elizabeth J. (Mrs. Z. T.) Lindsey, second auditor; committee\r\nchairmen; Mrs. Wheeler, Education; Mrs. A. E. Sheldon, Finance; Mrs.\r\nHardy, Publicity; Mrs. Edna M. Barkley, Speakers; Mrs. A. H. Dorris,\r\nPress.\r\n\r\nHeadquarters were opened Jan. 3, 1913, in the Brandeis Theater\r\nBuilding, Omaha, and maintained through the winter of 1912-13. Mrs.\r\nDraper Smith had at once assumed her duties as president and appointed\r\nMrs. W. C. Sunderland chairman for the second congressional district,\r\nincluding Douglas, Sarpy and Washington counties. She had asked Mrs.\r\nLindsey to be chairman of Douglas county in which Omaha is situated,\r\nwho soon had ten precincts organized under capable chairmen, and a\r\nlittle later every ward in Omaha and South Omaha. On February 8 Dr.\r\nShaw, the national president, arrived in Omaha for a conference with\r\nthe workers. On Sunday afternoon she addressed a mass meeting in the\r\nBrandeis Theater at which there was not even standing room. John L.\r\nKennedy presided. The committee of arrangements included the Rev.\r\nFrederick T. Rouse of the First Congregational Church; Judge Howard\r\nKennedy, Superintendent of City Schools; E. U. Graff, City Attorney;\r\nJohn E. Rine, C. C. Belden and the officers of the suffrage\r\nassociation. A resolution was before the Legislature to submit an\r\namendment to the voters but it was so evident that it would not be\r\npassed that the work for the initiative petition went on rapidly. The\r\nlast of February thirty-six Omaha women and others from over the State\r\nwent to Lincoln to see the vote taken in the House. The proposal was\r\ndefeated, only one man from Douglas county voting for it.\r\n\r\nIn the early spring the headquarters were moved to Lincoln and the\r\npetition work for the State was managed from there, with the\r\nexception of that of Omaha. Throughout the year the task was continued\r\nof obtaining the signatures in the various counties, all done by\r\nvolunteers. It was necessary at the same time to create public\r\nsentiment and organize clubs in preparation for the campaign for the\r\nsubmission of the amendment which would follow. In Omaha Mrs.\r\nSunderland soon turned the district organization over to Mrs. James\r\nRichardson and took the position of city chairman. Meetings were held\r\nwith prominent local speakers. On November 5 Chancellor Avery of the\r\nState University spoke for woman suffrage before the State Teachers'\r\nAssociation in the First Methodist Church. Two days later Dr. Shaw\r\naddressed it in the auditorium. She spoke at noon before the\r\nCommercial Club, a distinction given by it to a woman for the first\r\ntime. On Nov. 6, 7, the State convention was held in Lincoln and Mrs.\r\nClara Bewick Colby, formerly of Beatrice, was made honorary president.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1914, a Men's Suffrage League was formed in Omaha with E.\r\nH. Geneau, T. E. Brady, Henry Olerichs and James Richardson promoting\r\nit. On February 2 a thorough canvass of the business part of the city\r\nwas begun by the women. Mrs. Lindsey thus described it:\r\n\r\n     With a blizzard raging and the thermometer at 5 degrees below\r\n     zero women stood in drug stores and groceries, and visited office\r\n     buildings, factories and shops, wherever permission could be\r\n     obtained, soliciting signatures for six consecutive days. Mrs. C.\r\n     S. Stebbins, nearly seventy years of age, stood at the street car\r\n     barns and filled several petitions and Mrs. Isaac Conner, a\r\n     suffrage worker since 1868, made a similar record. Mrs. W. P.\r\n     Harford and Mrs. George Tilden arranged to have people standing\r\n     at the church doors for names at the close of service on Sunday.\r\n     Many ministers offered their churches to the committee and spoke\r\n     of the matter from their pulpits. Of all the Protestant churches,\r\n     only the Episcopal refused the committee's request, Dean James A.\r\n     Tancock of Trinity Cathedral and the Rev. T. J. Mackay of All\r\n     Saints declining. Petitions were kept open at the _Daily News_\r\n     office and other offices and places of business. Fifteen of the\r\n     leading drug stores offered space to the women under the\r\n     direction of Mrs. E. S. Rood, and it was decided to continue the\r\n     intensive campaign until the 12th, when the county chairman had\r\n     called a meeting at the city hall to celebrate Lincoln's\r\n     birthday, to hear Medill McCormick of Chicago and to announce\r\n     results. A large crowd of petition workers, sympathizers and\r\n     members of the Men's League was present. While the goal for\r\n     Douglas county was 5,000 signatures over 9,000 had passed\r\n     through the hands of the county chairmen on their way to the\r\n     Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n     Three days later Mrs. J. W. Crumpacker of Kansas appeared in\r\n     Omaha to organize the opposition forces. The anti-suffragists,\r\n     led by Mrs. Arthur Crittenden Smith, announced a meeting at\r\n     Turpin's Hall on the afternoon of February 23. Mrs. Arthur M.\r\n     Dodge, president of the National Association Opposed to Woman\r\n     Suffrage, and Miss Minnie Bronson, secretary, both of New York,\r\n     addressed the meeting. Forty people were present, including five\r\n     reporters and a number of suffragists. Those who joined at that\r\n     meeting were Mesdames Edward P. Peck, William Archibald Smith, T.\r\n     J. Mackay, E. A. Benson and Misses Ada Alexander, Genevra March\r\n     and Minnie Martison. A temporary committee on organization was\r\n     appointed consisting of Mesdames Arthur C. Smith, J. C. Cowin,\r\n     Herman Kountze, J. W. Crumpacker, E. A. Benson; Misses Wallace,\r\n     Riley, Alexander and McGaffney.... The next evening a public\r\n     meeting was held at the American Theater, addressed by Mrs. Dodge\r\n     and Miss Bronson, who were introduced by John L. Webster.[108]\r\n\r\nOn March 11 the district chairman, Mrs. Richardson, and county\r\nchairman, Mrs. Lindsey, with a group of workers, sorted, checked and\r\nmade into neat parcels the precious sheets of paper, which Mrs. Draper\r\nSmith carried to Lincoln that afternoon. Possibly half a dozen men had\r\ncirculated petitions but the bulk of the 11,507 names were obtained in\r\nOmaha by women. On March 14 the completed petition for submitting the\r\namendment was filed with the Secretary of State in the presence of the\r\nGovernor. Although only 37,752 signatures were required it had 50,705\r\nand these represented sixty-three counties instead of the required\r\nthirty-eight. They were accepted without question and the amendment\r\nwas submitted to the voters at the general election, Nov. 4, 1914.\r\n\r\nFrom that time until the election strenuous and unceasing efforts were\r\nmade to secure votes for the amendment. Many prominent Nebraska men\r\nand women spoke and worked for it and a number were brought into the\r\nState. On July 6 was issued in Omaha the famous Manifesto by the\r\nNebraska Men's Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage, a pamphlet of\r\nnine pages, signed by thirty prominent men, all of Omaha.[109] Early\r\nin July Park Commissioner J. B. Hummel of Omaha refused to grant any\r\nmore permits for meetings in the parks and the suffragists arranged a\r\nvoiceless automobile parade through all of them when they were filled\r\nwith people, the cars decorated with banners and pennants carrying\r\nsuffrage sentiments. Later the commissioner spoke for the amendment.\r\nOn August 4 the first street meeting was held by \"General\" Rosalie\r\nJones of New York, who spoke from the steps of the county court house\r\nat noon and on a corner in the evening. This was followed by street\r\nmeetings in an endless number of towns. County fairs and all possible\r\nforms of publicity were utilized. An outstanding feature of the\r\ncampaign was the automobile tours, the plan of Mrs. F. M. Hall,\r\nchairman of Lancaster county. They covered 20,000 miles and included\r\n500 places containing one-half of the population. Several of the\r\nlongest were made and financed by J. L. Kennedy and James Richardson\r\nof Omaha and W. E. Hardy of Lincoln.\r\n\r\nMiss Jane Addams came from Chicago and spoke several times in October.\r\nWilliam Jennings Bryan, who was making a political canvass of the\r\nState, never failed to make an appeal for the amendment and on October\r\n31 gave a rousing suffrage speech in Brandeis Theater, Omaha. Dr. Shaw\r\nended her tour of the State on the 30th, with an address in the\r\nauditorium.\r\n\r\nThe anti-suffragists were well financed and active. Their National\r\nAssociation sent Miss Marjorie Dorman to Omaha the last of September,\r\nwho opened headquarters on the first floor of the City National Bank.\r\nMrs. A. J. George was sent in October. On November 2 there appeared in\r\nthe morning papers a double-column appeal to the Catholics to vote\r\nagainst the amendment because back of it were the Socialists,\r\nfeminists, etc. It was signed by Mrs. L. F. Crofoot, wife of the Omaha\r\nattorney for the Northern Pacific R. R.\r\n\r\nDuring the campaign a committee of business men was formed by the\r\nbrewing interests, which visited the husbands of various women engaged\r\nin the effort for the amendment. They said \"suffrage means\r\nprohibition\" and threatened the husbands in a business way unless\r\ntheir wives retired from the work. This committee watched the papers\r\nand when names of women were given as interested in suffrage, even to\r\nthe extent of attending a luncheon for some celebrity, the husbands\r\npromptly were visited. Through this intimidation many women were\r\nforced to withdraw and many men who would have subscribed generously\r\ndid not dare give more than $25, as the State law required the\r\npublication of names of all contributing over this sum.\r\n\r\nThree days before election an \"appeal\" to its members was sent by the\r\nGerman-American Alliance, a large and powerful organization. It was\r\nwritten in German and began as follows:\r\n\r\n     We consider the proposed amendment to the constitution granting\r\n     the right of suffrage to women as the most important question\r\n     which will be decided at the coming election. Our State Alliance\r\n     took a most decided stand against woman suffrage at its annual\r\n     convention held in Columbus August 25. Our German women do not\r\n     want the right to vote, and since our opponents desire the right\r\n     of suffrage mainly for the purpose of saddling the yoke of\r\n     prohibition on our necks, we should oppose it with all our\r\n     might.... We most earnestly urge our friends of German speech and\r\n     German descent not to permit business or other considerations to\r\n     prevent them from going to the polls and casting their ballots as\r\n     above directed.\r\n\r\nOn November 4 the Omaha suffragists stood all day at the polls handing\r\nslips to the voters calling attention to the amendment on the ballot.\r\nThe total State vote on it was 100,842 noes, 90,738 ayes; adverse\r\nmajority of 10,104. The result of the splendid campaign in Douglas\r\ncounty, the stronghold of the opponents of all kinds, was seen in the\r\nsmall adverse majority of 1,188. Throughout the campaign the Omaha\r\n_Daily News_ valiantly championed the amendment and the _Bee_ and the\r\n_World Herald_ as strongly opposed it. The National American Suffrage\r\nAssociation contributed $4,000 in cash, the services of two\r\norganizers--Miss Jane Thompson and Miss Elsie Benedict--and paid the\r\ntravelling expenses of a number of national speakers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe State convention of 1914 was held in Omaha in December and it was\r\ndecided to organize more thoroughly and to seek the advice of the\r\nNational Association as to how and when to try again. The board which\r\nhad served throughout the campaign was re-elected. When it had begun\r\nthere were not fifty clubs in the State; when it ended there were\r\nnearly 500 and it was desired to hold them together as far as\r\npossible. The opponents had insisted that women did not want the\r\nballot and it was arranged to have an enrollment under the direction\r\nof Mrs. Wheeler. This was continued until the names of 30,000 women\r\nhad been enrolled as desiring the suffrage. The press work was\r\ncontinued and the never-ending effort to educate the people.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1915 was held at Columbus in October, was well\r\nattended, with a good program. Mrs. Edna M. Barkley was elected\r\npresident. In October, 1916, the convention was held at Hastings. Mrs.\r\nWilliam Jennings Bryan was guest of honor and gave the opening address\r\non Sunday evening in the Congregational church. Mrs. Catt, now\r\nnational president, was present and remained two days. The association\r\nexpected to appeal to the voters again in 1918 for full suffrage and\r\nshe thought it was in good condition to do so. Her inspiring presence\r\nand her very able address given to a large evening audience made this\r\none of most notable conventions. Mrs. Barkley was re-elected\r\npresident.[110]\r\n\r\nIn January, 1917, the National Association was beginning the \"drive\"\r\nto obtain partial suffrage from the Legislatures and Nebraska was\r\nurged to undertake it. The board agreed to concentrate on a bill which\r\nwould be constitutional and would permit women to vote for all\r\nofficers not specified in the State constitution and upon all\r\nquestions not referred to in it.\r\n\r\nThe bill was introduced by Senator C. E. Sandell of York county and\r\nRepresentative J. N. Norton of Polk county. Mrs. Barkley was chairman\r\nof the Legislative Committee and no measure ever had more careful and\r\npersistent \"mothering\" than she gave this one, watching over it for\r\nmonths. The bill passed the House the middle of February by the\r\nmagnificent vote of 73 to 24 in the presence of an audience of\r\napplauding women that filled the galleries. In the Senate the bill\r\nwent to the Committee on Privileges and Elections, which granted a\r\nhearing on February 15. After a luncheon with enthusiastic speeches\r\nthe entire body of 250 women, including 65 from Omaha, marched to the\r\nState House, where even the aisles were already crowded with women.\r\nAmong the speakers were George W. Howard, the eminent professor of\r\nhistory in the State University, and a number of prominent Nebraska\r\nmen and women. Six \"antis\" were present and their spokesman was Miss\r\nBronson of New York. The hearing lasted three hours. The bill was held\r\ntwo months in the committee and finally was reported out and passed by\r\na vote of 20 to 13 on April 19. It was signed by Governor Keith\r\nNeville on the 21st and gave women the suffrage for presidential\r\nelectors, all municipal and most county officers.[111]\r\n\r\nThe opponents immediately started an initiative petition to have the\r\nlaw submitted to the voters and on July 22 it was suspended in\r\noperation by the filing of a petition for a referendum on it by the\r\nAnti-Suffrage Association. Mrs. Barkley with others after inspection\r\nconcluded it was not a bona fide petition. Accordingly she summoned\r\nher board to discuss taking the proper legal steps to prove that it\r\nwas fraudulent and invalid. There was no money in the treasury with\r\nwhich to undertake expensive litigation and there were those who\r\nthought it wiser not to attempt it. The courage and determination of\r\nMrs. Barkley were the deciding factor and it was the same brave and\r\npersistent effort that finally won the long-drawn-out legal battle. A\r\nfull account was given by Mrs. Draper Smith in the _Woman Citizen_ of\r\nwhich the following is a part:\r\n\r\n     For the larger part of the session in 1917 the Senate had been\r\n     under great pressure from the public and the press to pass the\r\n     bone dry law that the House had almost unanimously adopted.\r\n     Nineteen members of the Senate belonged to the clique led by\r\n     representatives of the brewing interests. They fought for weeks\r\n     to secure the consent of the House to a bill that would have made\r\n     prohibition impossible of enforcement. Into this maelstrom the\r\n     limited suffrage law was plunged. Only the most careful\r\n     leadership secured its final passage....\r\n\r\n     On the 21st of July the opponents caused to be filed with the\r\n     Secretary of State a petition asking that the law be referred to\r\n     the voters at the general election in 1918 for approval or\r\n     rejection. This petition contained the signatures of 32,896\r\n     persons who claimed to be legal voters of the State and to live\r\n     at the places designated as their legal residence.... Tact and\r\n     patience were employed to get Secretary of State Pool to the\r\n     point where he permitted the suffragists to make a copy. Eighteen\r\n     thousand names bore the marks of an Omaha residence. The others\r\n     were apparently gathered from two-fifths of the counties and\r\n     presumptively represented 5 per cent. of the legal voters, as\r\n     required by law. Suspicion that fraud and deception had been\r\n     used, both in getting genuine signatures and in padding the\r\n     lists, early gave way to positive conviction. When the\r\n     investigation was complete it was found that 16,460 of the 32,896\r\n     signatures were subject to court challenge and that at least\r\n     10,000 of them were the product of fraud, forgery and\r\n     misrepresentation. Prominent members of the bar volunteered their\r\n     services--T. J. Doyle, C. A. Sorenson, John M. Stewart and H. H.\r\n     Wilson of Lincoln, and Elmer E. Thomas and Francis A. Brogan of\r\n     Omaha. A petition to enjoin the Secretary of State from placing\r\n     the referendum on the election ballot was filed in February,\r\n     1918.\r\n\r\n     The Omaha workers were under the leadership of Mrs. H. C. Sumney,\r\n     vice-president of the State association, and Mrs. James\r\n     Richardson. They discovered that many of the residence addresses\r\n     given were in railroad yards, cornfields or vacant lots. Many\r\n     others were of men who had never lived at the addresses given;\r\n     many affirmed that they had never signed any such petition;\r\n     others that they had been induced to sign by the representation\r\n     of the solicitor that it was to submit the question of full\r\n     suffrage. The work of running down each of the 18,000 names\r\n     consumed days of arduous labor. It was also found that page after\r\n     page of the names were written by the same hand. Experts in\r\n     handwriting from the various banks in Lincoln spent night after\r\n     night poring over the original petitions in the office of the\r\n     Secretary of State, picking out and listing the forgeries, which\r\n     were found to have been scattered all over the State.\r\n\r\n     The request of the suffragists to the Secretary of State said\r\n     that the circulators had committed perjury in certifying that\r\n     these fictitious persons had affixed their names in their\r\n     presence; that many of the names written thereon were not placed\r\n     there, as the law required, in the presence of the circulator,\r\n     but that the petitions had been left in pool halls, soft drink\r\n     parlors, cigar stores and barber shops where everybody, including\r\n     minors, was invited to sign, the circulator later coming around\r\n     and gathering them up. It also said that many of the signatures\r\n     were obtained by infants incapable at law of properly circulating\r\n     or certifying to the petition sheets and that a number of\r\n     circulators named had engaged in a systematic course of fraud and\r\n     forgery, thereby making invalid all of the names. Attached were\r\n     twenty pages of exhibits in proof of these charges.\r\n\r\n     The evidence in Omaha was matched by that in fifty-nine other\r\n     counties taken by the referee and attorney.\r\n\r\nThe attorneys enjoined the Secretary of State from putting the\r\nreferendum on the ballot. Nineteen suffragists appeared as plaintiffs\r\nin the case as follows: Edna M. Barkley, Gertrude L. Hardy, Katharine\r\nSumney, Ida Robbins, Grace Richardson, Margaretta Dietrich, Grace M.\r\nWheeler, Ella Brower, Ellen Ackerman, Henrietta Smith, Inez Philbrick,\r\nHarriet M. Stewart, Mary Smith Hayward, Mamie Claflin, Margaret T.\r\nSheldon, Alice Howell, Ellen Gere, Eliza Ann Doyle, Katharine McGerr.\r\nAs the suit had been brought against the Secretary of State the\r\nAttorney General appeared for him and was joined by the attorneys of\r\nthe women's Anti-Suffrage Association. They argued that the plaintiffs\r\nwere not legally entitled to sue because they were not electors. The\r\ncourt upheld their right. The Secretary of State became convinced that\r\nthe petition was fraudulent and did not appear in the further\r\nlitigation. The suffrage forces were prepared with their evidence and\r\nwished to proceed at once with the case but all the dilatory tactics\r\npossible were used and it was not until the full legal time was about\r\nto expire that the opponents were brought to the point on May 17,\r\n1918. Mrs. Draper Smith's account continued:\r\n\r\n     Inspection of the original petition showed that of 116 petitions\r\n     secured by A. O. Barclay 68 were in the same handwriting.... The\r\n     name of one Omaha business man who had died three months previous\r\n     to the circulation of the petition was found; another who was\r\n     killed two months before, and another who had been dead for three\r\n     years. Witness after witness testified that his name on it was\r\n     forged.\r\n\r\n     Several other circulators forged so many names we asked that all\r\n     their work be thrown out. The hearing developed that forty\r\n     ex-saloon keepers and bartenders had these petitions on the bars\r\n     in their soft drink places; 831 names were secured by Dick\r\n     Kennedy, a negro who could neither read nor write. He appeared in\r\n     court in jail clothes, being under indictment for peddling\r\n     \"dope,\" and was unable to identify the petitions certified by\r\n     him. Ten boys, ranging in age from 8 to 15, were circulators.\r\n     Several men who could not read or write testified that they\r\n     supposed their names were being taken for a census. Many thought\r\n     the petition was to \"bring back beer.\" One man was told it was to\r\n     pave an alley. At one hearing interpreters had to be used for all\r\n     but two men. The treasurer of the Anti-Suffrage Association, Mrs.\r\n     C. C. George, whose name appears as witness to the signatures of\r\n     81 certificates on the back of Barclay's petitions, testified\r\n     that she did not remember him. On the back of each petition is a\r\n     certificate in which the circulator certifies that each man\r\n     signed in his presence and the signature must have two witnesses.\r\n     The soft drink men and others testified that although the name of\r\n     Mrs. George appeared as witness to their signatures they had\r\n     never seen her. She testified that the petitions went through the\r\n     hands of her association.\r\n\r\n     The following question was asked of another \"anti,\" wife of a\r\n     rector: \"Had you known that co-workers with you were Dick\r\n     Kennedy, an illiterate negro; Abie Sirian; Gus Tylee, employee of\r\n     Tom Dennison and a detective of doubtful reputation; 40 soft\r\n     drink men; Jess Ross, colored porter for Dennison; Jack\r\n     Broomfield, a colored sporting man and for twenty years keeper of\r\n     the most notorious dive in Omaha, and many others of this\r\n     character, would you have worked with them and accepted the kind\r\n     of petition they would secure?\" She replied: \"It would have made\r\n     no difference to me. I was working for a cause and would not have\r\n     cared who else was working for the same.\"\r\n\r\n     The testimony showed that the anti-suffrage association of Omaha,\r\n     under the leadership of Mrs. Crofoot, president, had at first\r\n     endeavored to employ to take charge of the work of circulating\r\n     the petitions the man who had conducted the publicity department\r\n     for the brewers in 1916.\r\n\r\nThe allegations of fraud were proved to the satisfaction of the\r\nDistrict Court. The opponents appealed from its decision, which was\r\nconfirmed by the Supreme Court in June, and the women entered into\r\npossession of this large amount of suffrage. By order of the court the\r\nanti-suffragists, together with the State, had to pay the costs of the\r\nlong legal battle which ended on January 25, 1919, in a glorious\r\nvictory for the suffragists. The costs were approximately $5,000.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. The State convention of 1917 was held in Omaha in\r\nDecember and it was omitted in the fall of 1918 on account of the\r\ninfluenza, and none was held until 1919. The Federal Amendment had\r\nbeen submitted by Congress on June 4 and a Ratification Committee had\r\nbeen appointed consisting of Mrs. Barkley, Mrs. Hardy and Mrs. Wheeler\r\nto secure an early calling of a special session of the Legislature.\r\nIt was arranged for the State convention to meet in Lincoln at the\r\ntime Governor Samuel R. McKelvie had called this special session to\r\nratify the amendment. The convention _en masse_ saw the ratification\r\nof both Houses on August 2 by unanimous vote and had the joy of being\r\npresent when it was signed by the Governor, who had been a consistent\r\nfriend of the cause. The regular session had memorialized Congress by\r\njoint resolution to submit the Federal Suffrage Amendment and\r\nrequested Senator Gilbert M. Hitchcock of Nebraska to vote for it. He\r\nvoted against it every time it became before the Senate. The other\r\nSenator, George W. Norris, voted in favor each time and was always a\r\nhelpful friend of woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe last State convention met in Omaha June 13-15, 1920, with 104\r\ndelegates in attendance. With Mrs. Charles H. Dietrich, who had been\r\nelected president the preceding year, in the chair, the association\r\nwas merged into the Nebraska League of Women Voters and Mrs. Dietrich\r\nwas made chairman.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, Aug. 28, 1920, at noon, whistles were sounded and bells\r\nwere rung for five minutes in Omaha and South Omaha to celebrate the\r\nproclamation by the Secretary of State at Washington that the woman\r\nsuffrage amendment was now a part of the constitution of the United\r\nStates and the struggle was over.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1919, there assembled in Lincoln a convention to rewrite\r\nNebraska's constitution, to be submitted to the electors Sept. 21,\r\n1920. This convention put a clause in the new constitution giving full\r\nsuffrage to women. Using the power delegated to it by the Legislature\r\nit provided that women should vote on the constitution and that the\r\nsuffrage amendment should go into effect as soon as the adoption of\r\nthe constitution was announced by the Governor. The rest of it was to\r\nwait until Jan. 1, 1921. This was done in order that women might vote\r\nat the general election in November, 1920. Before the constitution\r\nwent to the voters the Federal Amendment was proclaimed and women were\r\nfully enfranchised. With women voting the constitution received 65,483\r\nayes, 15,416 noes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[107] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Grace M.\r\nWheeler, historian of the State Woman Suffrage Association, and Miss\r\nMary H. Williams, member of the State Board from 1905.\r\n\r\n[108] A State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage was formed, whose\r\nExecutive Committee consisted of Mesdames Edward Porter Peck,\r\nchairman; Henry W. Yates, John C. Cowin, J. W. Griffith, W. H. Koenig,\r\nL. F. Crofoot, Gerrit Fort, John L. Webster, Helen Arion Lewis, Arthur\r\nCrittenden Smith, T. J. Mackay, F. N. Conner; Miss Janet M.

D. Sears, Mrs. Charles Dodge\r\nand Miss Maud May of Fremont, with Mrs. Crumpacker as special\r\nrepresentative of the National Association in the headquarters at 536\r\nBee Building.\r\n\r\n[109] This Manifesto will be found in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n[110] Besides those mentioned the following served on the official\r\nboard: Miss Lincola S. Groat, Mrs. Alice I. Brayton, Mrs. Stearns,\r\nMrs. Myrtle W. Marble, Dr. Emma Warner Demaree, Mrs. Ida Ensign, Mrs.\r\nRosa Modlin, Mrs. F. B. Donisthorpe, Mrs. Mary P. Jay, Mrs. Theresa J.\r\nDunn, Mrs. Margaret J. Carns, Mrs. Julia N. Cox, Mrs. Ada Shafer, Mrs.\r\nFrank Harrison, Mrs. E. L. Burke, Miss Ida Bobbins, Mrs. M. Bruegger,\r\nMrs. E. S.

Bell,\r\nMiss Edith Tobitt, Mrs. Kate Chapin House.\r\n\r\n[111] In March under the auspices of the National Association suffrage\r\nschools were held in Omaha and Lincoln. The instructors were Mrs.\r\nNettie R. Shuler, chairman of organization, Mrs. Halsey W. Wilson, its\r\nrecording secretary, and Mrs. T. T. Cotnam and the subjects taught\r\nwere Suffrage History and Argument, Organization, Publicity and Press,\r\nMoney Raising and Parliamentary Law. Of the nineteen schools held by\r\nthe National Association in various States none was larger. By request\r\nnight schools were opened with a crowded attendance at all sessions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nNEVADA.[112]\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the last century, through the efforts of Miss\r\nSusan B. Anthony and Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, president and\r\nvice-president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, a\r\nNevada association had been formed with Mrs. Frances A. Williamson\r\npresident and later Mrs. Elda A. Orr was elected. Mrs. Mary A. Boyd\r\nwas an officer. It held three or four successful conventions and had\r\nbills before the Legislature but no record exists of any activities\r\nafter 1899.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1909, Mrs. Clarence Mackay, who had organized an Equal\r\nFranchise Society in New York City, of which she was president, wrote\r\nto Miss Jeanne Elizabeth Wier, professor of history in the University\r\nof Nevada, asking if a branch society could not be organized in that\r\nState. Later Professor Wier conferred with Mrs. Mackay in New York. In\r\nthe autumn of 1910 an agreement to assist in such an organization was\r\nsigned by a large number of prominent men and women in Reno and\r\nfinally in January, 1911, Professor Wier issued a call for a meeting\r\nto be held in her home to form a society. Mrs. O. H. Mack, president\r\nof the Federation of Women's Clubs, sent an invitation to each club to\r\nbe represented at this meeting. It was soon evident that it would be\r\ntoo large for a private house and on January 24 a conference was held\r\nin the law office of Counsellor C. R. Reeves to arrange for a Saturday\r\nevening mass meeting. There were present Mr. Reeves, who was made\r\ntemporary chairman; Professor Wier, Mrs. Mack, Mrs. Henry\r\nStanislawsky, Professor Romanzo Adams, Judge William P. Seeds,\r\nAssemblyman Alceus F. Price, J. A. Buchanan, Mrs. Frank Page, Mrs.\r\nFrank R. Nicholas, who was made secretary, and J. Holman Buck, who was\r\nelected permanent chairman. A telegram of greeting was read from Mrs.\r\nMackay.\r\n\r\nA general meeting for organization was held the evening of February 4\r\nin Odd Fellows' Hall, which was far too small for the audience. The\r\nname State Equal Franchise Society was adopted. Mrs. Stanislawsky was\r\nelected president; Colonel Reeves, Mr. Price, Mrs. Mack and Miss\r\nFelice Cohn, vice-presidents; Mrs. Nicholas, Mrs. Grace E. Bridges and\r\nMrs. Alice Chism, recording and corresponding secretary and treasurer.\r\nA membership of 177 was reported. The board of twenty-one directors\r\nincluded most of those who have been named and in addition Dr. J. E.\r\nStubbs, president of the university; Mrs. A. B. McKinley, Dr. Morris\r\nPritchard, W. D. Trout, Mrs. Nettie P. Hershiser, Mrs. George\r\nArmstrong, Mrs. Florence H. Church, Mrs. G. Taylor, Mrs. Frank\r\nStickney.[113] Plans were made for a legislative lobby. A report of\r\nthe organization was sent to Mrs. Mackay, who consented that her name\r\nshould be used as honorary president but took no further interest in\r\nit or in the amendment campaign which soon followed and made no\r\ncontribution.\r\n\r\nBetween the above meetings Assemblymen Arnold and Byrne of Esmeralda\r\ncounty had introduced a joint resolution on January 30 to submit to\r\nthe voters an amendment to the State constitution to give full\r\nsuffrage to women. It was referred to the Committee on Elections,\r\nwhich on February 7 reported it unfavorably. Assemblyman J. A. Denton\r\nof Lincoln county secured a hearing before the Committee of the Whole\r\non February 20 and a large lobby from the society was present. Mrs.\r\nStanislawsky and Miss Cohn addressed the committee, emphasizing the\r\nfact that each of the political parties had declared in its State\r\nplatform for this referendum and all the women asked was to have the\r\nquestion sent to the voters. The resolution was put on file but at the\r\nbottom and every attempt to advance it failed but on March 6 it\r\nappeared in regular order. Speaker pro tem. Booth wanted it\r\nindefinitely postponed but was overruled. After numerous parliamentary\r\ntactics it was at length passed by 31 ayes, 13 noes, four absent and\r\nthe Speaker not voting. The resolution was first read in the Senate on\r\nMarch 7 and referred to the Committee on Education. Three days later\r\nit was reported without recommendation. It came before the Senate\r\nMarch 13 and after considerable \"fencing\" it passed by 16 ayes, 2\r\nnoes, one absent. Mrs. Stanislawsky, Mrs. Mack, Professor Wier, Mrs.\r\nChism, Miss Cohn and Mrs. Nicholas had worked strenuously in the two\r\nHouses.\r\n\r\nThe constitution requires that a resolution for an amendment must pass\r\ntwo successive Legislatures and the new association saw the task\r\nbefore it of getting the approval of another session in 1913. It\r\nreceived national and international attention about this time through\r\na banner six feet high and four wide, presented by Mrs. Arthur Hodges\r\nof New York, with the words, Nevada, Votes for Women, brought out in\r\nsage brush green letters on a field of vivid orange. This was shipped\r\nto New York and carried by Miss Anne Martin of Reno in a big parade in\r\nthat city and then taken to London and carried by her and Miss Vida\r\nMilholland of New York at the head of the American group in the great\r\nprocession of the Social and Political Union.\r\n\r\nHeadquarters were opened in the Cheney Building in Reno, Mrs. Hodges\r\nassuming the rent, where visitors were made welcome and literature\r\ngiven out. A series of lectures until November were arranged, the\r\nfirst one in the Congregational church, where Mrs. Stanislawsky gave\r\nan address to a crowded meeting. Later she moved to California and in\r\nFebruary, 1912, Mrs. Mack called a meeting and Miss Anne Martin was\r\nunanimously elected president. Mrs. Bridges, Mrs. Chism and Mrs. Mack\r\nwere re-elected. The other members of the board chosen were:\r\nVice-presidents, Mrs. F. O. Norton, Mrs. J. E. Church, Mrs. Jennie\r\nLogan, Mrs. Charles Gulling, Mrs. J. E. Bray, Miss B. M. Wilson;\r\nrecording secretary, Mrs. Burroughs Edsall. An active executive\r\ncommittee was appointed and plans were made for a vigorous campaign.\r\nMrs. Hodges continued to pay the rent of headquarters and a\r\nsubstantial bank account was built up by dues, subscriptions and\r\ncollections at meetings.\r\n\r\nMiss Martin attended the national suffrage convention at Philadelphia\r\nin November, where she told of the need of funds to further the\r\ncampaign and secured many pledges and donations. Dr. Shaw, the\r\npresident, promised $1,000 from the association after the amendment\r\nwas submitted. Mrs. Oliver H. P. Belmont and Mrs. Joseph Fels had\r\nbecome honorary presidents and the former gave $100; the latter made\r\nher contribution of $500 later. The Massachusetts association, through\r\nMrs. Maud Wood Park, $100; the National Association, $100 in cash and\r\n$100 in literature; the _Woman's Journal_ $45. California and Arizona\r\ngave funds and literature. A pamphlet entitled Woman Under Nevada\r\nLaws, by Miss B. M. Wilson, an attorney, had been published in a\r\nspecial edition of 20,000 and proved effective in rousing the women to\r\na sense of their rights and wrongs.\r\n\r\nThe rapid organization had its effect on legislators and politicians.\r\nThe resolution for submitting an amendment was presented in both\r\nHouses in 1913 and reported favorably by the Judiciary Committees. It\r\npassed in the House on January 24 by 49 ayes, 3 noes, one absent; in\r\nthe Senate on January 30 by 19 ayes, 3 noes. On March 3 it was signed\r\nby the Governor.\r\n\r\nThe educational work was done through the press, the platform and\r\nentertainments. Speakers of national note were secured, among them Dr.\r\nShaw, Mr. and Mrs. James Lees Laidlaw, and Mrs. Charlotte Perkins\r\nGilman, of New York; Dr. Charles F. Aked, of San Francisco; Miss Jane\r\nAddams of Chicago, and Miss Mabel Vernon of Washington. The meetings\r\nwere attended by about three men to one woman. Mr. Laidlaw assisted in\r\norganizing a Men's Suffrage League, among whose members were Supreme\r\nCourt Justice Frank Norcross, Dr. Stubbs, Superintendent of Public\r\nInstruction John Edwards Bray, S. W. Belford, Charles Gulling, A. A.\r\nHibbard, Professor J. E. Church, Captain Applewhite, the Rev. Mr.\r\nAdams, the Rev. Mr. Sheldon, George Taylor and John Wright.\r\n\r\nAt the annual meeting Feb. 25, 1913, it was announced that there were\r\nnearly 1,000 paid up members, with most of the counties organized and\r\nmany town societies. \"Nevada, the black spot on the map! To make it\r\nwhite, give women the suffrage,\" was the constant slogan. Miss Martin,\r\nMrs. Church, Mrs. Bray, Miss Wilson and Mrs. Bridges were re-elected.\r\nOther members chosen were: Vice-presidents, Mrs. Hugh Brown, Mrs.\r\nAlexander Orr, Mrs. George West, Mrs. Lyman D. Clark, Jr., Mrs. E. E.\r\nCaine, Mrs. Harry Warren; recording secretary, Mrs. J. B. Menardi;\r\ntreasurer, Mrs. Mabel Redman; auditors, Mrs. P. B. Kennedy, Mrs. W. T.\r\nJenkins.\r\n\r\nIn the little span of days that lay between the election of the State\r\nExecutive Committee in 1912 and the legislative session of 1913 the\r\nsixteen counties were organized, each under a chairman. Mrs. M. S.\r\nBonnifield as chairman of Humboldt county, with her helpers, Mrs. A.\r\nW. Card, Mrs. Mark Walser of Lovelock and Dr. Nellie Hascall of\r\nFallon, led their branches into the mining fields. It is not easy to\r\nrealize the difficulties under which these women labored. Mrs. H. C.\r\nTaylor, chairman of Churchill county, had to drive many miles from her\r\nranch to attend every meeting. Some of the chairmen were Mrs. A. J.\r\nMcCarty, Mineral county; Mrs. Rudolph Zadow, Eureka; Mrs. Sadie D.\r\nHurst, Washoe; Mrs. Bray, Ormsby; Mrs. F. P. Langdon, Storey; Mrs.\r\nCaine, Elko; Mrs. Minnie Comins MacDonald, White Pine.\r\n\r\nMrs. Church, Miss Mary Henry, Mrs. Hurst, Mrs. Belford, and Mrs. Maud\r\nGassoway were an active force in organizing societies at Sparks, Verdi\r\nand Wadsworth in Washoe county, the largest in the State. Mrs. W. H.\r\nBray organized study classes in Sparks and gave prizes for the best\r\nsuffrage essays. Mrs. Hurst addressed large street crowds in Reno\r\nevery Saturday night. An important feature of the campaign was the\r\ncomplete circularization of the voters with suffrage literature by the\r\ncounty organizations and from State headquarters by Mrs. Bessie\r\nEichelberger, State treasurer for two years, assisted by Miss\r\nAlexandrine La Tourette of the State University; Mrs. Belford, Mrs. P.\r\nL. Flannigan, Mrs. Alf. Doten, Miss Minnie Flannigan, Mrs. Charles E.\r\nBosnell and Mrs. John Franzman. Mrs. Hood, the second vice-president,\r\nand chairman of civics in the State Federation of Women's Clubs, was\r\nthe leading factor in getting its endorsement at its meeting in Reno,\r\nOct. 30, 1913.\r\n\r\nNevada's population of only 80,000 is scattered over an area of\r\n110,000 square miles, a territory larger than the whole of New\r\nEngland. Of these, 40,000 are men over twenty-one years of age, of\r\nwhom only 20,000 remained in the State long enough to vote at the last\r\ngeneral election--an average of one voter to every five square miles.\r\nNevada has the smallest urban and the most scattered rural population\r\nin the United States. Reaching and winning this vote was done mostly\r\nby press work and literature. The new voters on the registration lists\r\nwere circularized. The personal contact with the voter was\r\naccomplished by street meetings in the cities and towns; in the rural\r\ncommunities by train, automobile, stage and even on horseback.\r\n\r\nAll the political parties but the Republican endorsed the amendment in\r\ntheir platforms and it was supported by labor unions representing\r\n6,000 members. Prestige and assistance were given by an Advisory Board\r\nconsisting of U. S. Senators Francis G. Newlands and Key Pittman,\r\nCongressman E. E. Roberts, Governor Tasker H. Oddie, Lieutenant\r\nGovernor Gilbert C. Ross, President Stubbs, Bishop Robinson and many\r\nprofessional and business men. There was fierce opposition from some\r\nnewspapers, including the Reno _Evening Gazette_, the leading\r\nRepublican paper of the State, but active support from the _State\r\nJournal_, owned and edited by George Darius Kilborn, formerly of New\r\nYork, who was always in favor of woman suffrage. The _Western Nevada\r\nMiner_, owned and edited by J. Holman Buck, gave much assistance in\r\nthat part of the State.\r\n\r\nIn canvassing and speaking tours over the State Miss Martin travelled\r\nover 3,000 miles and talked personally to nearly every one of the\r\n20,000 voters. There are 240 election precincts and over 180 were\r\norganized with a woman leader. On Nov. 3, 1914, every county was\r\ncarried for the amendment but four, each of these a county with one of\r\nthe largest and oldest towns in the State. The vote in Washoe county\r\nwas 1,449 for, 2,047 against; in Reno, the county seat, 938 for, 1,587\r\nagainst. Ormsby county with Carson City gave an adverse majority of\r\nonly 141; Storey county with Virginia City of only 31. The total vote\r\nwas 10,936 ayes, 7,257 noes--the amendment carried by 3,679. The cost\r\nof the whole three years' campaign was only a little more than $7,000.\r\n\r\nAt the annual meeting of the Washoe county Equal Franchise Society\r\nafter the election it was evident that, having won suffrage, women\r\nrecognized their new and enlarged responsibilities and were anxious to\r\ndo something for the public welfare and their own development. A mass\r\nmeeting was held in the Y. W. C. A. building and the Woman Citizens'\r\nClub was organized with a charter membership of 80. Mrs. Hurst was\r\nelected president. Other officers were: Vice-presidents, Mrs. Belford,\r\nMrs. C. H. Burke, Mrs. Hood; corresponding secretary, Mrs. Mack;\r\nrecording secretary, Mrs. Bessie Mouffe; financial secretary, Mrs.\r\nHarold Duncan; treasurer, Mrs. Eichelberger; auditor, Mrs. Katherine\r\nFlett; librarian, Mrs. F. C. MacDiarmid. This club succeeded in\r\ngetting a year as a required residence for those from other States\r\nseeking divorce and later another Legislature proposed to repeal it\r\nand restore the six months. Mrs. George F. Nixon, wife of the former\r\nU. S. Senator, was made legislative chairman and headed the women of\r\nReno who went almost _en masse_ to Carson City to protest but the\r\npressure on the other side was too strong and the old law was\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1918, The Woman Citizens' Club endorsed Mrs. Sadie D. Hurst\r\nof Reno for the Assembly, in recognition of what she had done for\r\nsuffrage and for the club. She won at the primaries and also at the\r\npolls in November and was the first woman member. The submission of\r\nthe Federal Woman Suffrage Amendment to the Legislatures by Congress\r\nseemed near and at the request of Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, the\r\nnational president, a Ratification Committee was formed in December.\r\nHelen T. (Mrs. S. W.) Belford was acting chairman with Mesdames\r\nWalser, Hood, McKenzie, Mack, Church, Boyd, Bray, Franzman, Fannie B.\r\nPatrick and Emma Vanderlith members. At the request of this committee\r\na resolution was presented to the Legislature by Mrs. Hurst on Jan.\r\n22, 1919, asking this body to memorialize Congress in favor of the\r\namendment. It passed the Assembly January 23 with but one dissenting\r\nvote; the Senate January 29 unanimously and the Nevada U. S. Senators\r\nwere requested to present and actively support it.\r\n\r\nIn March the committee elected Mrs. Patrick delegate to the national\r\nsuffrage convention in St. Louis and in April it met to hear her\r\nreport and details of the proposed League of Women Voters. The\r\nfollowing July a meeting was held to listen to Mrs. Minnie S.\r\nCunningham of Texas and Mrs. Ben Hooper of Wisconsin, who were touring\r\ncertain States under the auspices of the National Association, to\r\nconsult the Governors on the question of special sessions for the\r\nratification of the Federal Amendment, which had been submitted in\r\nJune. Mrs. Patrick and Mrs. Belford accompanied them to Carson City\r\nand had an interview with Governor Emmet D. Boyle. In September the\r\ncommittee considered the offer of a conference of officers and\r\nchairmen of the National League of Women Voters to be held in Reno. It\r\nwas arranged for November 20-21, with Mrs. McKenzie chairman of\r\nprogram, Mrs. Walser of finance, Mrs. Hurst of halls and Mrs. Belford\r\nof publicity.\r\n\r\nThe conference met in the Century Club House. Mrs Catt, Miss Jessie R.\r\nHaver, Dr. Valeria H. Parker, Mrs. Jean Nelson Penfield and Miss\r\nMarjorie Shuler, national chairman of publicity, were the guests of\r\nhonor. A luncheon at the Riverside Hotel was attended by about 70 men\r\nand women. An evening meeting was held in the Rialto Theater with Mrs.\r\nPatrick presiding. Governor Boyle introduced Mrs. Catt, who gave a\r\nrousing speech, Wake up America, and the others were heard at this and\r\nother times on the various departments of the league's work. At the\r\nlast session a State League of Women Voters was organized and later\r\nMrs. Belford was elected chairman.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. Governor Boyle issued a call for the Legislature to meet\r\nin special session Feb. 7, 1920, for the express purpose of acting on\r\nthe Federal Amendment, and in his Message when it convened he said:\r\n\"While no certainty exists that the favorable action of Nevada will in\r\n1920 assure to the women of the United States the same voting\r\nprivileges which our own women enjoy by virtue of our State law, it\r\ndoes appear certain that without our favorable action national\r\nsuffrage may be delayed for such a time as to withhold the right to\r\nvote in a presidential election from millions of the women of\r\nAmerica.\"\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. Hurst, the one woman member, was given the honor of\r\nintroducing the resolution to ratify in the House. On her motion the\r\nrules were suspended, the resolution was read the second time by title\r\nand referred to the Committee on Federal Relations. A recess of ten\r\nminutes was taken and when the Assembly reconvened a message from the\r\nSenate was received stating that the resolution had passed\r\nunanimously. The House committee recommended it and Mrs. Hurst moved\r\nthat it be placed on third reading and final passage. After this had\r\nbeen done she thanked the Assembly for the honor accorded her and\r\nclosed a brief but eloquent speech by saying: \"There is no necessity\r\nof asking you to ratify, for I am proud of the men of the West and of\r\nNevada.\" As the vote was about to be taken W. O. Ferguson of Eureka\r\ncounty announced that he would vote against the ratification; that he\r\nwas opposed to having the people of this State telling the women of\r\nthe Union whether or not they should vote and that he came to Carson\r\nCity especially to vote against the resolution. At this stage Speaker\r\nFitzgerald stated that twenty-seven Legislatures had already ratified\r\nthe amendment but so far as he was aware no woman had presided over\r\none taking such action and he had great pleasure in being able to\r\nrequest Mrs. Hurst to take charge of proceedings during roll call.\r\nTwenty-five members answered in favor of ratification, and one, Mr.\r\nFerguson, against it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hurst declared the resolution carried. At the suggestion of\r\nAssemblyman Sanai an opportunity was given to the women to address the\r\nlegislators. Those speaking were Mrs. Patrick, chairman, and Mrs.\r\nBelford, secretary of the Ratification Committee; Mrs. Church,\r\npresident of the State Federation of Women's Clubs, and Mrs.\r\nEichelberger, chairman of its suffrage committee; Mrs. Hood, regent of\r\nthe State University; Mrs. Maud Edwards, president of the W. C. T. U.,\r\nand Mrs. L. D. Gassoway. All expressed their appreciation of the\r\nspecial session, to which most of the members had paid their own\r\nexpenses. Governor and Mrs. Boyle invited the legislators and the\r\nRatification Committee to the Mansion for luncheon. And thus was\r\nclosed the Nevada chapter on woman suffrage.\r\n\r\n\r\nA STORY OF THE NEVADA SUFFRAGE CAMPAIGN.[114]\r\n\r\nIn February, 1912, Miss Anne Martin of Reno, who had spent the years\r\n1909-11 in England, during which she worked for suffrage under Mrs.\r\nPankhurst, was elected president of the State Equal Franchise Society.\r\nMiss Martin, a native of Nevada, was a graduate of the State\r\nUniversity; had the degrees of A.B. and A.M. from Leland Stanford\r\nUniversity and had been professor of history in the former. She had\r\nstudied abroad and travelled widely but her whole interest had now\r\ncentered in woman suffrage. Miss B. M. Wilson of Goldfield was elected\r\nvice-president and Mrs. Grace Bridges of Reno, secretary. Mrs.\r\nStanislawsky had removed to California and the organization, with the\r\nlong wait between Legislatures and no definite work, had but a small\r\nmembership, no county organizations and no funds. It was obvious to\r\nMiss Martin and her associates that, judging by the experience of\r\nother States, the legislative vote of 1911 must be regarded as merely\r\ncomplimentary and the real battle must be fought in 1913. Miss Martin\r\ntherefore began the campaign by organizing the State in 1912. She paid\r\nher own expenses on speaking trips to every county for this purpose,\r\nalso on journeys to California, to the Mississippi Valley Suffrage\r\nConference at St. Louis in April and to the National Suffrage\r\nConvention in Philadelphia in November. Here she enlisted the interest\r\nand financial support of national and State leaders and an advisory\r\nboard of influential women outside of Nevada was formed.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1913, her report made to the State suffrage convention in\r\nReno showed that the Equal Franchise Society had been developed in one\r\nyear into a State-wide body, with practically every county organized\r\nand a large number of auxiliary town societies, and with nearly one\r\nthousand paid-up members. There was a bank balance of several hundred\r\ndollars, from collections at meetings, monthly pledges of members and\r\ngifts from Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, Mrs. Joseph Fels, Mrs. Oliver H. P.\r\nBelmont, Miss Alice Stone Blackwell, Mrs. George Day (Conn.), and\r\nConnecticut and Massachusetts suffrage associations and other eastern\r\nsupporters, and from suffrage leagues of California, Oregon, Arizona\r\nand Colorado. Reports also showed that a press bureau had been\r\norganized at State headquarters (principally Miss Martin and Mrs.\r\nBridges) by which Nevada's forty-five newspapers, chiefly rural\r\nweeklies, were supplied regularly with a special suffrage news\r\nservice; that every editor, all public libraries and railroad men's\r\nreading rooms, more than one hundred school districts and three\r\nhundred leading men and women throughout the State received the\r\n_Woman's Journal_ (Boston) every week, which always contained Nevada\r\nsuffrage news; that every voter on the county registration lists had\r\nbeen circularized with suffrage literature.\r\n\r\nAn advisory council of the State's most prominent men had been formed.\r\nEvery legislative candidate had been asked to vote for the suffrage\r\namendment, if elected, and, as a result of the favorable public\r\nopinion created by the new State organization, more than the necessary\r\nnumber had pledged themselves in writing, so the day after the\r\nelection in November it was known that there was a safe majority in\r\nthe coming Legislature if all pledges were kept. The Legislative\r\nCommittee of the Equal Franchise Society was on duty and within the\r\nfirst two weeks of the session, in January, 1913, the amendment was\r\npassed by both Houses and approved by Governor Oddie.\r\n\r\nThe problem before the State convention at Reno in February was how to\r\neducate the voters and overcome the active opposition of the liquor\r\nand other vested interests, which were determined to continue Nevada\r\n\"wide-open\" by \"keeping out the women.\" The convention re-elected Miss\r\nMartin and left in her hands the supervision of building up a majority\r\nfor the amendment at the election in November, 1914. During 1913 she\r\nhad kept the State organization actively at work by trips through the\r\nnorthern and southern counties and by securing the help of suffrage\r\nspeakers from other States. Miss Wilson, the vice-president and also\r\npresident of the Esmeralda County League, with headquarters at\r\nGoldfield, was in general charge of the southern counties, which had a\r\nvery large miners' vote. In November Miss Martin had gone as delegate\r\nto the National Woman Suffrage Convention in Washington, and there, in\r\naddition to promises of an organizer and money from Dr. Shaw, the\r\nnational president, she secured from Miss Alice Paul, chairman of the\r\nCongressional Union, the services of Miss Mabel Vernon, perhaps its\r\nmost capable organizer. She also obtained pledges of $1,000 from\r\nSenator Newlands; $1,000 from Mrs. Quincy A. Shaw of Boston through\r\nMrs. Maud Wood Park; $1,000 from the National American Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation; $500 from Mrs. Fels, $300 from Miss Eileen Canfield;\r\nalso $250 from Mrs. W. O'H. Martin of Reno and many smaller sums from\r\nindividuals and organizations.\r\n\r\nWith the assurance of an adequate fund, amounting to over $7,000 in\r\nall, the final \"drive\" for suffrage for Nevada women was begun after\r\nthe State convention. Miss Vernon arrived, as promised, in April and\r\nat once made a trip around the State to strengthen the county and\r\nlocal organizations. At State headquarters in Reno Miss Martin kept in\r\ntouch with the work in every section of the State, wrote suffrage\r\nleaflets and planned the final campaign. Its concrete object was to\r\nsecure the endorsement of labor unions, women's clubs and political\r\nparties; to rouse as many women as possible to active work and to have\r\nat least one in charge of every voting precinct; to reach every voter\r\nin the State with literature and by a personal message through a\r\nhouse-to-house canvass, and to appeal to both men and women everywhere\r\nthrough press work and public meetings addressed by the best speakers\r\nin the country.\r\n\r\nThe 20,000 voters were scattered over the enormous area of 110,000\r\nsquare miles. There was only one large town, Reno, with about 15,000\r\ninhabitants, and three or four others with a population of a few\r\nthousands each; the rest of the people lived far apart in families or\r\nsmall groups, in mining camps on distant mountains and on remote\r\nranches in the valleys. Nothing could prevent a heavy adverse vote in\r\nReno and other towns where the saloons, with their annexes of gambling\r\nrooms, dance halls and \"big business\" generally, were powerful, so\r\neverything depended on reducing their unfavorable majority by building\r\nup the largest possible majorities in the mining camps and rural\r\ndistricts. \"Every vote counts\" was the slogan.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1914, Miss Martin and Miss Vernon started out on their final\r\ncanvass of the State, \"prospecting for votes\" in the mines, going\r\nunderground in the vast mountains by tunnel, ladder or in buckets\r\nlowered by windlass to talk to the miners who were \"on shift\" and\r\ncould not attend the street or hall meetings. To reach less than 100\r\nvoters at Austin, the county seat of Lauder county, required a two\r\ndays' journey over the desert, and many places were a several days'\r\ntrip away from a railroad. By automobile, wagon, on horseback,\r\nclimbing up to mining camps on foot, the canvassers went; making a\r\nhouse-to-house canvass of ranches many miles apart; travelling 150\r\nmiles over the desert all day to speak to the \"camp,\" which was always\r\nassembled on the street in front of the largest and best lighted\r\nsaloon, on their arrival at dusk. Many were the courtesies they\r\nreceived from shirt-sleeved miners and cowboys. They were also greatly\r\nassisted by the suffrage association's local chairmen, who would\r\nhastily secure substitutes to cook for their \"hay crews\" and drive\r\nmiles to arrange meetings. They always tried to reach a settlement or\r\nhospitable ranch house for the night. Where this was not possible they\r\nslept on blankets in hayfields or on the ground in the heart of the\r\ndesert itself. The trip covered 3,000 miles.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile at State headquarters in Reno leaflets that had been\r\ncarefully written as appeals to \"give Nevada women a square deal\" were\r\naddressed to voters' lists as they registered for the approaching\r\nelection, under the direction of the society's treasurer, Mrs. Bessie\r\nEichelberger.\r\n\r\nA State labor conference representing 6,000 members endorsed the\r\namendment and every labor union that took a vote on it. The official\r\nendorsements of the Democratic, Progressive and Socialist parties were\r\nobtained. Individual Republicans supported it but the party refused\r\nits approval and the leading Republican newspaper, the Reno _Evening\r\nGazette_, under the orders of George Wingfield, multi-millionaire,\r\nwith other newspapers he controlled, bitterly fought the amendment to\r\nthe last. Only one or two newspapers, notably the _Nevada State\r\nJournal_, actively supported it but many published campaign news. Reno\r\npapers contained over 200 columns of suffrage matter. Fremont Older,\r\neditor of the San Francisco _Bulletin_, gave to State headquarters the\r\nvaluable services and paid the expenses of Miss Bessie Beatty, a\r\nmember of its staff, to direct the State-wide press campaign of news\r\nand advertisements planned for September and October. With the\r\nassistance of President Stubbs and in spite of the opposition of\r\nRegent Charles B. Henderson, a College Equal Suffrage League was\r\nformed at the State University, under the leadership of Miss Clara\r\nSmith, and a suffrage essay contest was promoted in the schools of\r\nthe State. Through Judge William P. Seeds' and Miss Martin's efforts a\r\nMen's Suffrage League was formed, to counteract the so-called Business\r\nMen's League, organized to fight the amendment.\r\n\r\nA state-wide Anti-Suffrage Society was organized during the last\r\nmonths, led by Mrs. Jewett Adams and Mrs. Paris Ellis of Carson, Mrs.\r\nFrank M. Lee of Reno and Mrs. John Henderson of Elko. Miss Minnie\r\nBronson of New York and Mrs. J. D. Oliphant of New Jersey, sent by the\r\nNational Anti-Suffrage Association, toured the State under their\r\nauspices. In contrast with the hardships of travel to remote places\r\nendured by the loyal workers for suffrage and the economic problems\r\nalways to be solved, the speakers for the \"antis\" only visited the\r\nlarge towns, were provided with every obtainable luxury and the\r\nmeetings well advertised and arranged.\r\n\r\nThe organizer promised by the National Suffrage Association, Mrs.\r\nLaura Gregg Cannon, arrived in September and was sent at once to\r\norganize more thoroughly the southern counties, as success depended on\r\nan overwhelming vote from the miners and ranchers there. Miss Margaret\r\nA. Foley of Boston also came, as arranged by Miss Martin, for constant\r\nspeaking through the northern and southern counties during the last\r\ntwo months. Miss Jane Addams gave a priceless four days to a whirlwind\r\ntour. The Overland Limited was stopped for her to speak at Elko and\r\nWinnemucca. She ended her trip at Reno, where she addressed an\r\noverflow mass meeting at the Majestic Theater just two weeks before\r\nelection day. A large public dinner was given in her honor at the\r\nRiverside Hotel by the State Franchise Society. Dr. Shaw, tireless\r\ncrusader and incomparable speaker, travelled swiftly through the State\r\nby train and automobile during the eight days she gave in October,\r\nwhich were filled with receptions and crowded meetings. Mrs. Martin\r\ngave a reception in her home in Reno, whose hospitality was extended\r\nthroughout the campaign to those who came from outside the State to\r\nhelp it. Dr. Shaw's strenuous itinerary included meetings at Battle\r\nMountain, Winnemucca, Lovelocks, Reno, Washoe, Carson City, Virginia\r\nCity, Tonopah, Goldfield, Las Vegas and Caliente. She made many\r\nhundreds of votes for the amendment.\r\n\r\nOther notable outside speakers and workers, whose interest was aroused\r\nby Miss Martin and who gave their services during the nearly three\r\nyears' sustained effort, were Miss Annie Kenney of London, Mr. and\r\nMrs. James Lees Laidlaw, Miss Ida Craft and \"General\" Rosalie Jones of\r\nNew York; Mrs. Antoinette Funk of Chicago; Mr. and Mrs. William Kent,\r\nDr. Charles F. Aked, J. Stitt Wilson, Miss Gail Laughlin, Dr. Mary\r\nSperry, Mrs. Sara Bard Field, Miss Maud Younger, Miss Charlotte Anita\r\nWhitney, Mrs. Alice Park, Mrs. Eleanor Stewart, Mrs. Mary Ringrose of\r\nCalifornia. The last named did valuable work among the Catholics. Miss\r\nMary Bulkley and Mrs. Alice Day Jackson, a granddaughter of Isabella\r\nBeecher Hooker, whom Miss Martin had interested on her visit to\r\nConnecticut, came at their own expense and for three weeks canvassed\r\nReno, Carson City, Virginia City and other places. Miss Vernon's work\r\nin organization and her many strong speeches on the streets of Reno\r\nand in meetings throughout the State were an important factor in\r\nwinning votes. While many splendid Nevada women worked with enthusiasm\r\nand great efficiency in every county, yet without Miss Martin's\r\nleadership in organizing them and direction of the campaign during the\r\nyears 1912-13-14, and without the money she gave and raised, woman\r\nsuffrage in Nevada would probably have been delayed for several years.\r\nShe personally contributed in her travelling expenses and other ways\r\nover $2,000. Aside from this sum the entire three years' campaign was\r\nmade at a cost of $7,000.\r\n\r\nOut of the 240 precincts in the State every one that had ten votes in\r\nit was canvassed and open air or hall meetings held before election.\r\nMore than 180 were organized, each with a woman leader, who, with her\r\ncommittee, \"picketed the polls\" every hour during election day,\r\nhanding out the final appeal to give women a square deal by voting for\r\nthe amendment. The suffrage map showing Nevada as the last \"black\r\nspot\" in the West was printed in every newspaper and on every leaflet,\r\nput up in public places and on large banners hung in the streets.\r\n\r\nThe amendment received the largest proportionate vote for woman\r\nsuffrage on record. Reno and Washoe county, as had been anticipated,\r\nwent against it by a majority that was brought down to 600. Of the\r\nremaining fifteen counties, three others, the oldest in the\r\nState--Ormsby, Storey and Eureka--also defeated the amendment, but the\r\nfavorable majorities of the other northern counties and the staunch\r\nsupport of the miners in the south won the victory. Esmeralda, a\r\nmining county and one of the largest in population, gave a majority\r\nfor the amendment in every precinct. Out of 18,193 votes cast on it,\r\nit had a majority in favor of 3,679, and Nevada gave its leverage on\r\nCongress for the Federal Amendment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the annual convention of the State Equal Franchise Society in Reno\r\nin February, 1915, the Nevada Woman's Civic League was formed as its\r\nsuccessor. It continued an affiliated member of the National American\r\nWoman Suffrage Association, pledged to support the Federal Amendment.\r\nIts object was to meet a general demand of the newly enfranchised\r\nwomen for information about the wise use of the ballot.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[112] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. O. H. Mack,\r\nvice-president of the State Equal Franchise Society.\r\n\r\n[113] Charter members besides those already mentioned were Mrs. J. E.\r\nStubbs, J. D. Layman, C. A. Jacobson, Mrs. Jennie Blanche Taylor, Mrs.\r\nJulia F. Bender, J. E. Church, Miss Laura de Laguna, Grant Miller,\r\nMiss Kate Bardenwerper, Mrs. W. H. Hood, Mrs. Orr, Mrs. Boyd, Mrs.\r\nGeorge McKenzie, Mrs. May Gill.\r\n\r\n[114] The History is indebted for this sketch to Miss B. M. Wilson,\r\nvice-president of the State Equal Franchise Society during the\r\ncampaign, 1912-1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nNEW HAMPSHIRE.[115]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere has been a woman suffrage association in New Hampshire since\r\n1868 with some of the State's most eminent men and women among its\r\nmembers. In 1900 it took on new life when the New England Association,\r\nwith headquarters in Boston, sent Mrs. Susan S. Fessenden to speak and\r\norganize. In 1901 Miss Mary N. Chase of Andover spent a month forming\r\nsocieties and a conference was held at Manchester in December,\r\naddressed by Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, president of the National\r\nAmerican Woman Suffrage Association, and Henry B. and Miss Alice Stone\r\nBlackwell, editors of the _Woman's Journal_.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 the National Board engaged Miss Chase as organizer for a\r\nmonth. A State Suffrage Association was formed with seven auxiliary\r\nclubs and the following officers were elected: President, Miss Chase,\r\nhonorary president, Mrs. Armenia S. White, Concord; honorary\r\nvice-presidents, ex-U. S. Senator Henry W. Blair, U. S. Senator Jacob\r\nH. Gallinger; vice-president, Miss Elizabeth S. Hunt, Manchester;\r\nsecretary, Miss Mary E. Quimby, Concord; treasurer, the Rev. Angelo\r\nHall, Andover; auditors, Miss Caroline R. Wendell, Dover; Sherman E.\r\nBurroughs (afterwards member of Congress), Manchester.\r\n\r\nA convention met in Concord December 2 to revise the State\r\nconstitution and on the 4th Captain Arthur Thompson of Warner offered\r\nan amendment which struck out the word \"male\" from the suffrage\r\nclause. A hearing on it was granted on the 9th and Mrs. Catt and Mr.\r\nand Miss Blackwell addressed the convention. After long discussion by\r\nthe delegates it was voted on the 11th, by 145 to 92 that this\r\namendment should be submitted to the voters with the revised\r\nconstitution in March, 1903. The State suffrage convention was held in\r\nDecember at the time the hearing took place. The officers of the\r\nState association did a great deal of work before the constitutional\r\nconvention met to influence its action. Miss Chase spoke 103 times\r\nbefore the local Granges, an important factor in State politics. Miss\r\nQuimby circularized the delegates, prepared a leaflet of opinions from\r\nprominent citizens and aided in securing a petition of 2,582.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1903, Mrs. Catt came and took charge of the campaign,\r\nremaining until the vote was taken in March. Others from outside who\r\ngave their services without pay, speaking throughout the State, were\r\nDr. Anna Howard Shaw, vice-president of the National Association; Mrs.\r\nJ. Ellen Foster, Mrs. Harriot Stanton Blatch, Mrs. Mary D. Fiske, Mrs.\r\nPriscilla D. Hackstaff, Mrs. Maud Wood Park and Mrs. Mary E. Craigie.\r\nThe National Association contributed $3,255 to the campaign and\r\nvarious States sent generous donations. Among the New Hampshire\r\nspeakers were Captain Arthur Thompson, the Rev. Charles W. Casson\r\n(Unitarian) of Milford; the Hon. Oliver E. Branch of Manchester; the\r\nHon. Clarence E. Carr of Andover. Miss Chase continued her work among\r\nthe Granges, addressing thirty-seven. Miss Quimby circularized 87,000\r\nvoters. Mrs. White gave the headquarters in Concord. Seventy-five\r\nministers preached sermons in favor of the amendment.\r\n\r\nSo much interest was aroused that the opponents wrote for Dr. Lyman\r\nAbbott of New York to come to Concord. Among the signers of the letter\r\nwere former Governor Nahum Batchelder of Andover; Judge Edgar Aldrich\r\nof the district court of Littleton; Winston Churchill of Cornish;\r\nIrving W. Drew of Lancaster and George H. Moses of Concord.[116] On\r\nMarch 4 Representatives' Hall was packed to hear addresses against the\r\namendment by Miss Emily P. Bissell of Delaware; Mrs. A. J. George of\r\nBrookline, Mass.; Judge David Cross of Manchester and Dr. Abbott. The\r\nConcord _Monitor_ of that date in a leading editorial said: \"Through a\r\nmaudlin sense of false sentiment the constitutional convention sent\r\nthis question to the people ... and the people will deal with it as it\r\ndeserves.\" On March 5 came the speeches of the suffragists.\r\nRepresentatives' Hall was even more crowded than before and scores\r\nwere turned away. The Hon. James O. Lyford of Concord presided and the\r\nspeakers were Mrs. Catt, Mr. Branch, one of the ablest lawyers in the\r\nState, and Henry H. Metcalf of Concord, founder and editor of the\r\n_Granite Monthly_. The amendment was submitted to the voters March 10\r\nwith the constitution. The votes in favor were 14,162; against,\r\n21,788, lost by 7,626.\r\n\r\nDuring the year the membership of the association more than doubled.\r\nThe annual meeting was held in the Unitarian Church, Milford, November\r\n18, 19. In 1904 the National Association engaged Miss Chase to do\r\nthree months' organization work and the membership increased 137 per\r\ncent. The annual meeting was held in the Christian Church at Franklin\r\nNovember 14, 15, with addresses by the Rev. Nancy W. Paine Smith\r\n(Universalist) of Newfields and other State speakers. On Oct. 30, 31,\r\n1905, the State convention was held at Claremont with Dr. Shaw as the\r\nprincipal speaker. The most important work of the year had been the\r\neffort to secure a Municipal suffrage bill. Mrs. Mary I. Wood of\r\nPortsmouth, president of the State Federation of Women's Clubs, had\r\nbeen the chief speaker at the hearing.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 the convention was held at Concord, October 30, 31, with\r\naddresses by Dr. Shaw, Mrs. Wood, vice-president, and Mrs. Fannie J.\r\nFernald of Old Orchard, president of the Maine Suffrage Association.\r\nMrs. White, now 89 years old, gave reminiscences of the early days of\r\nthe suffrage movement. Among the clergymen taking part were the\r\nReverends Edwin W. Bishop (Congregationalist); John Vannevar, D.D.\r\n(Universalist); Daniel C. Roberts, D.D. (Episcopalian); L. H.\r\nBuckshorn (Unitarian); E. C. Strout (Methodist); John B. Wilson\r\n(Baptist), all of Concord; and the Rev. Olive M. Kimball\r\n(Universalist) of Marlboro.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 the convention was held in Manchester October 25 with Dr.\r\nShaw, national president, as the inspiring speaker. The State\r\nFederation of Labor had unanimously endorsed woman suffrage. On\r\nJanuary 2 at Washington, D. C., had occurred the death of Mrs. Henry\r\nW. Blair of Plymouth and Manchester, whose husband, U. S. Senator\r\nHenry W. Blair, had secured the first vote in the Senate on the\r\nFederal Suffrage Amendment. Both were lifelong friends of the cause.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 prizes were offered in the State Granges for the best essays\r\nin favor of Woman Suffrage and excellent ones were sent in. A lecture\r\nbureau had been organized and eighteen men and women were speaking at\r\npublic meetings. On October 23 Mrs. Mary Hutchinson Page of Boston\r\naddressed a meeting at the home of Agnes M. (Mrs. Barton P.) Jenks,\r\npresident of the Concord society. The State convention was held in\r\nPortsmouth November 11, 12, where Dr. Shaw as usual made the principal\r\naddress and Miss Aina Johanssen, a visitor from Finland, gave an\r\ninteresting account of woman suffrage there.\r\n\r\nBy 1909 there was considerable advance in favorable sentiment and\r\npeople of influence were seeing the justice of the cause. Governor\r\nHenry B. Quinby and his wife gave their support. The Rev. Henry G.\r\nIves (Unitarian) of Andover and his wife were strong advocates.\r\nIntensive work had been done in the 275 Granges, their State lecturer\r\nsending out instructions to discuss woman suffrage at April meetings.\r\nFifty-four Grange essays were submitted for the prizes by the State\r\nassociation. Resolutions in favor of woman suffrage were passed by the\r\nState Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the Universalist State\r\nConvention. The annual convention was held in Manchester November 11,\r\naddressed by Mrs. Fernald and the Rev. Ida C. Hultin (Unitarian),\r\nSudbury, Mass.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1910, Miss Ethel M. Arnold of England lectured for the\r\nConcord society in the Parish House (Episcopalian). The annual meeting\r\nwas held in the Free Baptist Church at Franklin November 15, 16. Among\r\nthe speakers was the Rev. Florence Kollock Crooker (Universalist) of\r\nRoslindale, Mass. Miss Chase had given addresses in thirty-one towns\r\nand cities and organized nine new committees.\r\n\r\nIn 1911 an attractive booth at the Rochester Agricultural fair, made\r\npossible by Miss Martha S. Kimball of Portsmouth, drew crowds and\r\n10,000 leaflets were distributed and hundreds of buttons and pennants\r\nsold. The Free Baptist convention passed a resolution favoring\r\nsuffrage. Mrs. Jenks attended the congress of the International Woman\r\nSuffrage Alliance at Stockholm, Sweden, as delegate. At a meeting of\r\nthe Concord society where the special guest was the Woman's Club,\r\naddresses were made by Judge Charles R. Corning, Mrs. Winston\r\nChurchill and Mrs. Jenks. The noted English suffragist, Miss Sylvia\r\nPankhurst, spoke there on March 30. In 1912 the convention was held in\r\nPortsmouth December 4, 5 in the chapel of the old North Congregational\r\nChurch. The Rev. Lucius Thayer, pastor since 1890, and his wife were\r\nstrong suffragists. Mrs. Maud Wood Park of Boston made the principal\r\naddress. Miss Chase after having held the presidency ten years\r\ndeclined re-election and was succeeded by Miss Kimball, who was\r\nre-elected for the next seven years.[117]\r\n\r\nIn 1913 a brilliant suffrage banquet, the first of its kind, was given\r\nat the Eagle Hotel, Concord, on February 28, attended by notables from\r\nall parts of the State. Mrs. Wood was toast mistress. Among the\r\nspeakers were Governor Samuel D. Felker, Mrs. Josiah N. Woodward,\r\npresident of the State Federation of Women's Clubs, and William J.\r\nBritton, Speaker of the House. On May 9 a debate was held in the\r\nWoman's Club of Newport, between Miss Frances M. Abbott of Concord,\r\npress agent of the State association, and Mrs. Albertus T. Dudley of\r\nExeter, president of the State Society Opposed to Woman Suffrage. The\r\nlarge audience voted in favor of woman suffrage. The convention was\r\nheld at Concord, December 10, 11, with addresses by Mrs. Katherine\r\nHoughton Hepburn, president of the Connecticut association; Witter\r\nBynner of Cornish, the poet and playwright, and Senator Helen Ring\r\nRobinson of Colorado. Miss Kimball subscribed $600, the largest\r\nindividual contribution yet received. Mrs. Jenks gave a report of the\r\nmeeting of the International Suffrage Alliance at Budapest, which she\r\nattended. This year the charters of Manchester and Nashua were changed\r\nby the Legislature to give School suffrage to women.\r\n\r\nIn 1914 the convention was held in the Y. M. C. A. Hall, Manchester,\r\nNovember 11, 12, with able State speakers. Major Frank Knox, head of\r\nthe Manchester _Union_, always strong for suffrage, presided in the\r\nevening. Ten county chairmen were appointed. The association\r\ncooperated with that of Vermont in a booth at the State fair at White\r\nRiver Junction.\r\n\r\nIn 1915 State headquarters in charge of Miss Abbott were opened in\r\nConcord and continued five months during the legislative session.\r\nPublic meetings were addressed by Mrs. Marion Booth Kelley and Mrs.\r\nPark of Boston; Mrs. Antoinette Funk of Chicago, member of the\r\nNational Congressional Committee; Mrs. Deborah Knox Livingston of\r\nBangor and U. S. Senator Hollis of New Hampshire. Miss Jeannette\r\nRankin of Montana made a few addresses. A large illuminated \"suffrage\r\nmap\" was framed and put in the State House and other public places.\r\nQuantities of suffrage literature were sent out, including 400\r\nsuffrage valentines and tickets for the suffrage film Your Girl and\r\nMine to the legislators. At the 150th anniversary celebration of the\r\nnaming of Concord on June 8 an elaborate suffrage float and several\r\ndecorated motor cars filled with suffragists, two of college women in\r\ncaps and gowns, were in the procession. Many members marched in the\r\nparade in Boston October 6. Through Miss Kimball's generosity Mrs.\r\nMary I. Post of California was sent for six months' work in the New\r\nJersey campaign. Later she took charge of headquarters in Manchester\r\nand in Concord. The State convention was held at Nashua December 2, 3.\r\nAmong the speakers were Miss Zona Gale, the novelist; U. S. Senator\r\nMoses E. Clapp of Minnesota, and John R. McLane, son of former\r\nGovernor McLane of New Hampshire.\r\n\r\nOn May 7, 1916, Mrs. Armenia S. White passed away at the age of 98. To\r\nher more than to any one person was the suffrage cause in New\r\nHampshire indebted. With her husband, Nathaniel White, she had been\r\nfrom the first identified with the unpopular reforms, anti-slavery,\r\ntemperance and equal suffrage. More men and women of national\r\nprominence had been entertained under their roof than in any other\r\nhome in the State. A successful conference was held in Manchester\r\nFebruary 28, addressed by Mrs. Catt, president again of the National\r\nAssociation, and Mrs. Susan Walker Fitzgerald of Massachusetts. The\r\nState convention was held at Concord November 9, 10, with Dr. Effie\r\nMcCollum Jones of Iowa as the chief speaker.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1917, ten newspapers issued special suffrage editions\r\nwith plate matter furnished by the National Association and 3,000\r\nextra copies were mailed, besides thousands of suffrage speeches and\r\ncirculars. In March and April 371 Protestant, 81 Catholic and four\r\nJewish clergymen were circularized. The services of Mrs. Post were\r\ngiven to Maine for two weeks' and to New York for six weeks' campaign\r\nwork. Money also was sent to the Maine campaign. The State convention\r\nwas held at Portsmouth, November 8, 9, with addresses by Mrs. Park,\r\nMrs. Post, Mrs. Wood, Congressman Burroughs and Huntley L. Spaulding\r\nof Rochester, Government Food Administrator.\r\n\r\nIn 1918 as chairmen of committees, the State officers were almost\r\nsubmerged in war work, as were the other members of the association,\r\nbut although no State convention was held they did not cease their\r\nsuffrage duties. Mrs. Halsey W. Wilson, national recording secretary,\r\naddressed a number of the leagues, urging them to keep alive their\r\ninterest and be ready for the next step, which would be the\r\nratification of the Federal Amendment. On August 17 occurred the death\r\nof U. S. Senator Jacob H. Gallinger. A staunch friend of woman\r\nsuffrage for fifty years, much of the time vice-president of the State\r\nassociation, it seemed the irony of fate that death intervened when\r\nhis vote and influence as Republican leader would have carried the\r\nFederal Suffrage Amendment without delay. Senator Hollis and\r\nRepresentatives Mason and Burroughs were in favor of it.\r\n\r\nIrving W. Drew of Lancaster, an avowed \"anti,\" was appointed by\r\nGovernor Henry W. Keyes as Senator until the fall election. It was\r\nsaid that he was urged to appoint an opponent by Senator Henry Cabot\r\nLodge when he came to Concord to deliver Senator Gallinger's funeral\r\naddress. The situation was tense at the November election. Senator\r\nHollis (Democrat) declined to stand for another term and Governor\r\nKeyes (Republican) was elected in his place. The two candidates for\r\nSenator Gallinger's unexpired term were George H. Moses (Republican)\r\nand John B. Jameson (Democrat). Mr. Moses was known as an\r\nuncompromising opponent while Mr. Jameson was a sincere suffragist.\r\nThe prospects were good for Mr. Jameson's election when President\r\nWilson issued an appeal for the election of a Democratic Congress,\r\nwhich had the effect of stiffening the Republican ranks and Mr. Moses\r\nwas elected by a small majority. After his election the National\r\nAssociation sent a representative to interview him. He told her that\r\nhe was not interested in the question but that if the Legislature\r\nshould instruct him by resolution to vote for the Federal Amendment he\r\nwould do so. It would not sit for some time and therefore Mrs. Anna\r\nTillinghast of Boston, Miss Eva S. Potter and Mrs. Arthur L. Livermore\r\nof New York were sent by the National Association, and in cooperation\r\nwith the State association, secured a petition from more than\r\ntwo-thirds of the Legislature, which numbered 426 members, asking\r\nSenator Moses to vote for the amendment. When it was presented he said\r\nthat he must insist on a resolution.\r\n\r\nWhen the Legislature convened in 1919 Senator Moses made a trip to\r\nConcord, took a room in a hotel and made it his office, where he was\r\nvisited by members of the Legislature. It was current opinion that he\r\nwas using his influence against a resolution and the results bore out\r\nthe conclusion. The resolution was introduced in the House January 8\r\nby Robert M. Wright of Sanbornton and on the 9th in Committee of the\r\nWhole it granted a hearing. The galleries were crowded with people\r\nfrom all parts of the State and many women were invited to sit with\r\nthe legislators. The speakers urging the resolution were: Mrs. Catt,\r\nMrs. Wood, Mrs. Winfield L. Shaw of Manchester, also Miss Doris\r\nStevens representing the National Woman's Party. Those opposing it\r\nwere Mrs. Albertus T. Dudley of Exeter, president of the State\r\nAnti-Suffrage Association; James R. Jackson of Littleton; Mrs. John\r\nBalch of Milton, Mass., and Miss Charlotte Rowe of Yonkers, N. Y.,\r\nrepresenting the National Anti-Suffrage Association. The resolution\r\nwas carried by 210 to 135 votes.\r\n\r\nIt was now most important to win the Senate. The twenty-four members\r\nwere again interviewed by the suffragists and seventeen declared their\r\nintention to vote for the resolution. On January 14 it was introduced\r\nby Senator John J. Donahue of Manchester and six Senators voted for\r\nit, fifteen against it!\r\n\r\nIt was generally believed and freely charged that Senator Moses,\r\nastounded at the vote in the House, had used all the influence he\r\npossessed to prevent the Senate from concurring. It was publicly\r\nstated that Senator Lodge and other Republican U. S. Senators urged\r\nthe members not to vote for the resolution. When the vote was to be\r\ntaken three men, Merrill Shurtleff of Lancaster, alleged to be the\r\npersonal representative of U. S. Senator John W. Weeks of\r\nMassachusetts, and the best lobbyist in the State, assisted by Burns\r\nP. Hodgman, clerk of the District Court, and John Brown of Governor\r\nBartlett's Council, appeared to confer with the legislators. At this\r\ntime U. S. Senators Dillingham of Vermont and Wadsworth of New York\r\npublished a letter in the papers of the State protesting against the\r\naction of the Republican National Committee in favor of the Federal\r\nSuffrage Amendment. Nothing was left undone to secure an adverse vote\r\nin the New Hampshire Senate. Mrs. Catt issued to the press a detailed\r\nrecord of each State Senator, showing that 11 of the 15 who voted\r\nagainst the resolution had signed the petition to Senator Moses asking\r\nhim to vote for the Federal Amendment. The adverse vote stood 12\r\nRepublicans, 3 Democrats; the Republican president of the Senate not\r\nvoting.\r\n\r\nSenator Moses returned to Washington and voted against the Federal\r\nSuffrage Amendment every time it came before the Senate; in February,\r\n1919, when it lacked only one vote, he disregarded an urgent appeal\r\nfrom Theodore Roosevelt made a few days before his death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn March, 1919, the National Association sent one of its best\r\norganizers, Miss Edna Wright, to interest the leagues in ratification\r\nand the State Association retained her for the remainder of the year.\r\nInvitations for a Citizenship School at Durham, July 8-12, were sent\r\nout by the association and President Hetzel of the State College, the\r\nfirst time in history that a State College had cooperated with women\r\nin such an undertaking. The school was organized by Miss Wright and\r\npresided over by Mrs. Wood, with the publicity and press conference in\r\ncharge of Miss Marjorie Shuler, sent by the National Association.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. The Federal Suffrage Amendment had been submitted by\r\nCongress to the Legislatures in June and the vital question now was\r\nratification. A mass meeting was held in Manchester at which Governor\r\nBartlett announced that he was willing to call a special session to\r\nratify. Realizing from past experience that the association could have\r\nlittle influence with it, the board appointed Huntley N. Spaulding, a\r\nprominent citizen, chairman of a Men's Committee for Ratification, and\r\nhe called to his aid Dwight Hall, chairman of the State Republican\r\nCommittee, and Alexander Murchie, chairman of the State Democratic\r\nCommittee. The Governor can not call a session without the consent of\r\nhis Council, which consists of five men. It met on August 13 and the\r\nGovernor arranged to have a hearing for the women. Mrs. Olive Rand\r\nClarke, Mrs. Winfield Shaw of Manchester, Mrs. Charles Bancroft of\r\nConcord and Mrs. Vida Chase Webb of Lisbon made short speeches. After\r\nthe hearing the Council voted to call a special session for September\r\n9.\r\n\r\nMr. Hall and Mr. Murchie immediately got in touch with the members of\r\nthe Legislature belonging to their respective parties. Under the\r\ndirection of Mr. Spaulding a remarkable publicity campaign was\r\ninaugurated and the leading men of the State, many of whom had been\r\nextremely opposed to woman suffrage, gave interviews in favor of\r\nratification. The Manchester _Union_ devoted its front pages to these\r\ninterviews for three weeks. Marked copies were sent not only to\r\nmembers of the Legislature but to the 750 committeemen of each of the\r\nparties. James O. Lyford, dean of the Republicans, put his political\r\nknowledge at the disposal of the committee. Miss Betsy Jewett Edwards\r\ncame from the National Woman's Republican Committee and did splendid\r\nwork among the Republicans, who made up a large majority of both\r\nHouses. Miss Kimball, State president, gave devoted service and much\r\nfinancial assistance. Miss Wright had entire charge of the office\r\nwork, publicity, organization, etc.\r\n\r\nThe special session met on September 9 and the Governor sent a strong\r\nmessage calling for ratification. The House voted on the opening day,\r\n212 ayes to 143 noes. The real test was in the Senate, which on\r\nSeptember 10 gave forty minutes to outside speakers. Mrs. Mary I. Wood\r\nspoke for the suffragists and Mrs. F. S. Streeter of Concord, Miss\r\nCharlotte Rowe and two Senators for the opponents. The Senate\r\nratified by 14 to 10 and Governor Bartlett signed the bill without\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nThe last meeting of the State Association, its work accomplished, took\r\nplace in Manchester, November 21, 22, 1919. Mrs. Nettie Rogers Shuler,\r\nnational corresponding secretary, described the aims of the League of\r\nWomen Voters, and, after discussion, it was decided to merge the\r\nassociation into a State League. Miss Kimball was elected chairman.\r\nThe National Association had contributed to New Hampshire during the\r\nlast year about $3,000.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION: 1905. A bill for Municipal suffrage was introduced\r\nin the House by William F. Whitcher of Haverhill, a hearing granted\r\nand it was reported out of the Judiciary Committee by a vote of 7 to 2\r\nbut got no farther.\r\n\r\n1907. The bill was introduced by Mr. Whitcher but the House Judiciary\r\nCommittee reported against it 8 to 7. An attempt to have the minority\r\nreport substituted was defeated February 20 by a vote for indefinite\r\npostponement of 224 to 77.\r\n\r\n1909. The chairman of the Legislative Committee, Mrs. Barton P. Jenks,\r\nconducted an energetic campaign for the bill and a hearing was held\r\nbefore the Judiciary Committee, which reported 8 to 7 against it, and\r\nin the House on the question of substituting the minority report the\r\nvote was 86 ayes; 115 noes.\r\n\r\n1911. Bills for Municipal suffrage were introduced by Mr. Whitcher and\r\nGeorge S. Sibley of Manchester. The large committee room was crowded\r\nfor the hearing. The speakers were Mrs. Jenks, the Rev. John Vannevar,\r\nMrs. Wood and Miss Chase, the latter presenting a petition of 1,100\r\nnames headed by Governor and Mrs. Quinby and Clarence E. Carr, recent\r\ncandidate for Governor. The committee reported the bill favorably but\r\non January 26 the House voted to postpone indefinitely by 160 to 121.\r\n\r\n1913. The association had two bills, one for Municipal and one for\r\nPresidential and County suffrage. The latter, introduced by Raymond B.\r\nStevens of Landaff, Congressman-elect, had a hearing February 19, at\r\nwhich one of the chief affirmative speakers was Dean Walter T. Sumner\r\nof Chicago, later Bishop of Oregon, who was in town for the Conference\r\nof Charities and Corrections. The Judiciary Committee reported the\r\nbill favorably but six out of fifteen members signed an adverse\r\nreport. The debate in the House on March 18 was particularly acrid.\r\nAmong the speakers in favor were Levin J. Chase of Concord and Edward\r\nC. Bean of Belmont, later Secretary of State. The saloon element as\r\nusual was prominent in the opposition. The roll call showed 98 ayes;\r\n239 noes.\r\n\r\n1915. The bill for Municipal suffrage was unfavorably reported by the\r\nCommittee on Revision of Statutes. On March 17 when the vote to\r\nsubstitute the minority report was taken the State House was crowded\r\nwith eager throngs from all parts of the State. Mr. Chase, Benjamin W.\r\nCouch and James O. Lyford spoke in favor. Dr. Thomas Manley Dillingham\r\nof Roxbury represented the \"antis.\" The vote was 121 ayes; 230 noes. A\r\nbill for Presidential suffrage had previously been killed in\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\n1917. Bills for Presidential and for County and Municipal suffrage\r\nwere introduced into both Houses. The former was favorably reported by\r\nJoseph P. Perley, Daniel J. Daley and Clarence M. Collins of the\r\nSenate Committee with a minority report by Obe G. Morrison and Michael\r\nH. Shea, which was substituted February 7 by a vote of 16 to 7. The\r\nfavorable report of eight of the fifteen members of the House\r\nCommittee was submitted by John G. Winant, afterward vice-rector of\r\nSt. Paul's School, Concord. The struggle came on March 7 when it was\r\ndebated for several hours with galleries crowded and finally defeated\r\nby 205 to 152. On March 16 the bill for Municipal suffrage was\r\ndefeated without debate or roll call.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[115] The History is indebted for this chapter to Miss Frances M.\r\nAbbott, treasurer of the State College Equal Suffrage League, writer\r\nand genealogist.\r\n\r\n[116] Mr. Drew and Mr. Moses as U. S. Senators in 1918 were able to\r\ndefeat the passage of the Federal Suffrage Amendment, which lacked\r\njust two votes. Mr. Churchill afterwards became an earnest advocate of\r\nwoman suffrage.\r\n\r\n[117] It has been impossible to obtain a complete list of those who\r\nhave served as officers but the following is a partial list of those\r\nnot mentioned elsewhere. Vice-presidents: Mrs. Ella H. J. Hill,\r\nConcord; Mrs. Frank Knox, Manchester; secretaries: the Rev. Olive M.\r\nKimball, Marlboro; Mrs. Henry F. Hollis, Concord; Dr. Alice Harvie,\r\nConcord; Mrs. Edna L. Johnston, Manchester; Mrs. Arthur F. Wheat,\r\nManchester; treasurers: Henry H. Metcalf, Harry E. Barnard, Frank\r\nCressy, Miss Harriet L. Huntress, all of Concord; auditors: Mrs.\r\nCharles P. Bancroft, Concord; the Rev. H. G. Ives, Andover; members\r\nNational Executive Committee: Mrs. Ida E. Everett and Dr. Sarah J.\r\nBarney, Franklin; Witter Bynner, Cornish; Mrs. Churchill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nNEW JERSEY. PART I.[118]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first women in the United States to vote were those of New Jersey,\r\nwhose State constitution of 1776 conferred the franchise on \"all\r\ninhabitants worth $250.\" In 1790 the election law confirmed women's\r\nright to the suffrage and in 1807 the Legislature illegally deprived\r\nthem of it. In 1867 Lucy Stone, then a resident of New Jersey,\r\norganized a State society, one of the first in the country, which\r\nlapsed after her removal to Massachusetts a few years later. In 1890 a\r\nnew State association was organized, which held annual meetings and\r\nwas active thereafter, although interest diminished after women lost\r\ntheir School suffrage in 1897. [See New Jersey chapter Volume IV.]\r\n\r\nMrs. Florence Howe Hall, a daughter of Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, was\r\npresident from 1893 until 1900, when she declined re-election. Mrs.\r\nMinola Graham Sexton of Orange was elected president at the annual\r\nmeeting in Moorestown in November. At that time there were but five\r\nlocal societies, which she soon increased to fifteen. With her during\r\nthe five years of her presidency were the following officers:\r\nVice-presidents, Mrs. Susan W. Lippincott of Cinnaminson; Catherine B.\r\nLippincott, Hartford; corresponding secretaries, Dr. Mary D. Hussey\r\nand Mrs. Bertha L. Fearey, East Orange, Mrs. Fanny B. Downs, Orange;\r\nrecording secretaries, Miss Jennie H. Morris, Moorestown, Miss Helen\r\nLippincott, Riverton; treasurer, Mrs. Anna B. Jeffery, South Orange;\r\nauditors, Mrs. Mary C. Bassett and Mrs. Emma L. Blackwell, East\r\nOrange; Mrs. Anna R. Powell and Mrs. Louise M. Riley, Plainfield. Mrs.\r\nRiley had started the first woman's club in the State in Orange in\r\n1872.\r\n\r\nThe Orange Political Study Club was the first suffrage club to join\r\nthe State Federation in 1901, which invited other clubs to hear Mrs.\r\nCarrie Chapman Catt, president of the National American Suffrage\r\nAssociation, give one of her convincing lectures. Mrs. Cornelia C.\r\nHussey of East Orange held a meeting in her park to hear the reports\r\nof the four delegates who attended the national convention at\r\nMinneapolis. Dr. Hussey gave out suffrage leaflets to the farmers on\r\ntheir \"salt water day\" at Sea Girt and to the Congress of Mothers at\r\nTrenton. Mrs. Eliza Dutton Hutchinson, press superintendent, got some\r\nof the plate matter from the National Association for the first time\r\ninto four newspapers. Letters were sent to 400 progressive women\r\ntelling them how the ballot would aid them in all good work and\r\ninviting them to join the association and many did so. The annual\r\nmeeting was held in Newark and Mrs. Howe Hall was elected honorary\r\npresident.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1902, Mrs. Sexton in cooperation with the National\r\nAssociation, held the first of the seashore meetings that were\r\ncontinued every summer as long as she was president. They were held\r\nfor two days in the Tabernacle at Ocean Grove and welcomed by Bishop\r\nFitzgerald and Dr. A. E. Ballard, heads of the Camp Meeting\r\nAssociation. The speakers were Mrs. Catt, Dr. Anna Howard Shaw,\r\nvice-president of the National Association, Miss Kate Gordon, its\r\ncorresponding secretary, and Miss Mary Garrett Hay, a national\r\norganizer. The Mayor and two editors became advocates of the cause. At\r\nthe Friends' conference at Asbury Park in September a day was devoted\r\nto political equality and Mrs. Catt and Mrs. Mariana W. Chapman,\r\npresident of the New York State Association, spoke. The annual meeting\r\nwas held at Orange and a board of directors was elected: the Rev.\r\nAntoinette Brown Blackwell, Elizabeth; Mrs. Katherine H. Browning,\r\nWest Orange; Mrs. Phebe C. Wright, Sea Girt; Mrs. Joanna Hartshorn,\r\nShort Hills; Miss Susan W. Lippincott and Mrs. Elizabeth Vail, East\r\nOrange. Memorials were read for Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Mrs.\r\nCornelia C. Hussey and Mrs. Sexton told of the $10,000 Mrs. Hussey had\r\nleft the National Association and of her constant generosity to the\r\nsuffrage work in New Jersey for many years. Mrs. Howe Hall and Henry\r\nB. Blackwell gave addresses. Women's clubs were urged to devote a\r\nmeeting to the discussion of woman suffrage and the Woman's Club of\r\nOrange, the largest in the State, heard Mrs. Catt and the Outlook Club\r\nof Montclair heard Mrs. Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Mrs. Florence\r\nFenwick Miller of England addressed a number of leagues. Miss Susan B.\r\nAnthony was heard early in May at the Political Study Club of Orange.\r\n\r\nIn 1903 large audiences again attended the two-day suffrage rally\r\nunder the auspices of the Camp Meeting at Ocean Grove. Dr. Shaw, Mrs.\r\nHall, Miss Harriet May Mills of New York and Mrs. Lucretia L.\r\nBlankenburg of Philadelphia were the speakers and the interest\r\nresulted in the starting of several leagues along the coast. With the\r\nhelp of the National Association Miss Mills was engaged for a month,\r\nduring which she formed ten new leagues, speaking twenty-four times in\r\nnineteen places. The leagues studied local government and found that\r\nwomen paid about one-third of the taxes. Mrs. Catt, Mrs. Ellis\r\nMeredith of Denver, Mrs. Stanton Blatch of New York and Miss Alice\r\nStone Blackwell of Boston were heard by different leagues. The\r\nconvention this year was held for the first time in Trenton.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 a special effort was made to bring the question of woman\r\nsuffrage before other organizations and Mrs. Sexton spoke to the\r\nFederation of Women's Clubs, the Conference of Charities and\r\nCorrections and the State W. C. T. U.; Dr. Hussey spoke before the\r\nconvention of the Epworth League and the subject was presented to the\r\nState Grange. At the Ocean Grove meeting Mrs. Emma Bourne brought\r\ngreetings from the State's 8,000 white ribboners. Mrs. Sexton and Miss\r\nMills spoke at seaside meetings and five new leagues were formed. The\r\nState convention was held in the public library in Jersey City and\r\nwelcomed by Dr. Medina F. DeHart, president of the Political Study\r\nClub; Miss Cornelia F. Bradford, head worker of Whittier House; Mrs.\r\nSpencer Wiart, president of the Woman's Club and Mrs. Andrew J.\r\nNewberry, president of the State Federation of Women's Clubs.\r\n\r\nAt the Ocean Grove meeting in 1905 resolutions were adopted in memory\r\nof Mrs. Mary A. Livermore. The State convention was held in Orange.\r\nMrs. Emma L. Blackwell, a niece of Lucy Stone, was elected president\r\nand the other officers were re-elected. In 1906 Miss Anthony passed\r\naway and many leagues held memorial meetings. The Woman's Club of\r\nOrange joined the suffrage association in holding one addressed by Dr.\r\nShaw, preceding the State convention held there in Union Hall in\r\nNovember. Henry B. Blackwell traced the history of woman suffrage in\r\nNew Jersey from 1776 and made a plea for the Presidential franchise\r\nfor women, for which a committee was appointed. Resolutions thanking\r\nthe American Federation of Labor for its stand on woman suffrage and\r\nexpressing sympathy with the imprisoned \"suffragettes\" in England were\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 little suffrage work was done by the association owing to the\r\nabsence of the president from the State. The leagues worked along many\r\nlines, for police matrons; for \"school cities\"; studied the lives of\r\nthe pioneers and the constitution and laws of the State and held\r\npublic meetings with good speakers. The annual convention met in the\r\npublic library in Newark and it was voted to petition Congress for a\r\nFederal Suffrage Amendment. Dr. DeHart was elected president and the\r\nother new officers were Mrs. Ella A. Kilborn and Miss Mary D.\r\nCampbell, secretaries. Miss Mary Willits and Mrs. Mary B. Kinsley were\r\nthe only other officers who had been added in the past seven years.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 at the State convention in Bayonne Mrs. Clara S. Laddey of\r\nArlington was elected president and Miss Emma L. Richards of Newark\r\nrecording secretary. Dr. Hussey was made chairman of the Committee on\r\nLiterature and Petitions and the Rev. Mrs. Blackwell was appointed to\r\nwrite to President Roosevelt in behalf of the Federal Suffrage\r\nAmendment, as requested by the National Association. Public lectures\r\nby Dr. Shaw, Miss Janet Richards of Washington and others were\r\narranged for Newark. Dr. Emily Blackwell, of the New York Infirmary\r\nfor Women, was made honorary president.\r\n\r\nMrs. Laddey visited all the leagues and spoke before many societies,\r\nincluding the large German Club at Hoboken. With Dr. Hussey she\r\nattended the State convention of the Federation of Labor and obtained\r\nits endorsement of the Federal Suffrage Amendment. She put new life\r\ninto the association and was re-elected at the State convention in\r\n1909 at Newark. Over fifty delegates were present and it was reported\r\nthat 5,000 names were on the petition to Congress which the\r\nSocialists, Granges, W. C. T. U.'s and Trade Unions had helped secure,\r\nand they had given an opportunity for much educational work.\r\nCommittees on legislation and organization were formed. Mrs. Sexton\r\nwas elected honorary president; Mrs. Elizabeth T. Bartlett of\r\nArlington was made historian and Mrs. Mary L. Colvin of East Orange,\r\ncorresponding secretary. Resolutions were adopted in memory of Henry\r\nB. Blackwell and William Lloyd Garrison. Professor Francis Squire\r\nPotter, corresponding secretary of the National Association, delivered\r\na very able address.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1909 two young women in East Orange, Dr. Emma O. Gantz\r\nand Miss Martha Klatschken, started the Progressive Woman Suffrage\r\nSociety and held the first open air meetings in the State. The first\r\none took place on a Saturday night at the corner of Main and Day\r\nstreets in Orange, the speakers Mrs. J. Borrman Wells of England, Miss\r\nKlatschken and Miss Helen Murphy of New York. The next was in Newark.\r\nThe crowds were always respectful, listened and asked questions. Much\r\nliterature was given out. A Political Equality League of Self\r\nSupporting Women, a branch of the one in New York organized by Mrs.\r\nStanton Blatch, was formed by Mrs. Mina Van Winkle, later called\r\nWomen's Political Union.\r\n\r\nAt the January board meeting in 1910 Mrs. Ulilla L. Decker was made\r\nchairman of organization and Mrs. Minnie J. Reynolds of the press\r\ncommittee. Mrs. Laddey reported having received an invitation to bring\r\ngreetings to a meeting at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Richard Stevens at\r\nCastle Point, Hoboken, to form a New Jersey branch of the Equal\r\nFranchise League which Mrs. Clarence Mackay had organized in New York.\r\nAt an adjourned meeting on February 3 Mrs. Decker reported having\r\nconsulted Mrs. Catt, Dr. Shaw, Miss Mary Garrett Hay and others in New\r\nYork and also in New Jersey about the proposed new league. Mrs. Laddey\r\nurged harmony among all workers and she, Dr. Hussey, Miss Emma L.\r\nRichards and others attended the meeting at Castle Point. The Equal\r\nFranchise Society of New Jersey was formed there with Mrs. Thomas S.\r\nHenry of Jersey City president; Mrs. Caroline B. Alexander, Hoboken,\r\nMrs. Everett Colby, West Orange, Mrs. George Harvey, Deal, and Miss\r\nAlice Lakey, Cranford, vice-presidents; Mrs. Harry Campton, Newark,\r\ncorresponding secretary; Miss Richards, Newark, recording secretary;\r\nMrs. Charles Campbell, Hoboken, treasurer.\r\n\r\nThe delegation of the State association to the national convention in\r\nWashington in April rode in the procession to the Capitol and\r\npresented a petition to Congress for a Federal Amendment containing\r\nover 9,000 signatures from New Jersey. At the great parade held in New\r\nYork on the last Saturday in May it was represented by its president\r\nand seven members. Its first experience with street speaking was in\r\nMilitary Park in June with Mrs. Priscilla D. Hackstaff of Brooklyn as\r\nthe speaker and a respectful audience. Open air meetings were also\r\nheld in Asbury Park at which Mrs. Laddey and Mrs. Emma Fisk spoke.\r\nMiss Richards took charge of a booth at the Olympic Park Fair,\r\nassisted by Mrs. Campton. Charles C. Mason was thanked for reviewing\r\nthe laws of the State relating to women compiled by Miss Laddey. Lucy\r\nStone's birthday was celebrated August 13 in six places in memory of\r\nher pioneer work in the State. Mrs. Laddey organized leagues in\r\nMontclair and Asbury Park and spoke at seven public meetings. Money\r\nwas contributed to the South Dakota, Washington and Oklahoma campaigns\r\nand to the national treasury. Congressmen were questioned as to their\r\nstand on woman suffrage. Dr. Shaw was heard at the Conference of\r\nGovernors at Spring Lake.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1910 was held in Plainfield welcomed by Mrs. C. R.\r\nRiley, the local president. The Rev. Mrs. Blackwell paid a tribute to\r\nMrs. Julia Ward Howe, who had passed away, and after resolutions by\r\nMrs. Colvin the \"Battle Hymn of the Republic\" was sung. Mrs. Decker\r\npresented a flag to the association in honor of Mrs. Sexton, the\r\nformer president. Mrs. Kinsley gave a greeting from the Equal\r\nFranchise Society. How it Works in Wyoming was told by Mrs. May\r\nPreston Slosson, Ph.D., and Dr. Edwin A. Slosson. In the evening Mayor\r\nCharles J. Fisk welcomed the convention. Professor Earl Barnes, who\r\nhad resided two years in England, gave an address on The Englishwoman.\r\nChamplain Lord Riley of Plainfield announced the organization in\r\nNewark on March 23 of the Men's League for Woman Suffrage with Dr.\r\nWilliam L. Saunders of Plainfield, president; Merton C. Leonard,\r\nArlington, vice-president; Dr. Edward S. Krans, Plainfield, secretary;\r\nEdward F. Feickert, Dunellen, treasurer and 17 members.[119]\r\n\r\nMrs. Laddey was re-elected. Four new committees were appointed on\r\nChurch Work, Mrs. Bartlett, chairman; Industrial Problems relating to\r\nWomen and Children, Miss Bessie Pope; Endorsement by Organizations,\r\nMrs. Laddey; Education, Mrs. Riley. Public meetings were held in the\r\nvarious cities; prizes for school essays were awarded and a year book\r\npublished. With the Equal Franchise Society the association had a\r\nhearing before the State Senate Committee on Education, Joseph S.\r\nFrelinghuysen, chairman in behalf of a School suffrage bill. Mrs.\r\nLaddey, Mrs. George T. Vickers, Mrs. Philip McKim Garrison, Mrs.\r\nFrederick Merck, and Mrs. Kinsley appeared for the suffragists. The\r\ncommittee approved it but the Legislature rejected it.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1911, a luncheon was given by the association in Newark to\r\nMrs. Minnie J. Reynolds, who had returned from work in the victorious\r\ncampaign in the State of Washington. At a board meeting it was decided\r\nthat some plan must be adopted for enrolling non-dues-paying members\r\nsimilar to that of the Woman Suffrage Party of New York. This name was\r\ntaken for New Jersey and an Enrollment Committee was formed with Mrs.\r\nLillian F. Feickert of Dunellen chairman, to organize by political\r\ndistricts. Over a hundred New Jersey women marched in the second New\r\nYork parade on May 4. The Life and Work of Susan B. Anthony was placed\r\nin libraries. The three associations agreed to unite in work for a\r\nsuffrage measure in the Legislature and Dr. Luella Morrow, Miss\r\nLaddey, Miss Grace Selden and Mrs. Howe Hall were appointed to have\r\ncharge of it. Mrs. Bartlett secured the favorable opinions of twelve\r\nNew Jersey clergymen and had them printed for circulation. The Equal\r\nJustice League of young women was started in Bayonne with eighty\r\nmembers, Miss Dorothy Frooks, president. At this time the State\r\nassociation had fourteen branches and about 500 members.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1911 was held in Willard Hall, Passaic, in November.\r\nAll rose to greet the Rev. Antoinette Brown Blackwell when she\r\nentered. Mayor George N. Seger in his welcome said that all women who\r\npaid taxes should vote and with the ballot women could help many\r\nneeded reforms. A hundred copies of the New York _American_ with an\r\neditorial on woman suffrage in New Jersey sent by Arthur Brisbane were\r\ndistributed.\r\n\r\nIt was voted to ask Governor Woodrow Wilson, as a Presidential\r\ncandidate, if he favored woman suffrage. Mrs. Rheta Childe Dorr of the\r\neditorial staff of _Hampton's Magazine_ appealed for legislation in\r\nbehalf of working girls. Miss Emma McCoy, president of the New\r\nBrunswick Teachers' Association, made a plea for equal pay for women\r\nteachers. Addresses were given by Robert Elder, assistant district\r\nattorney of Kings county, N. Y.; Mrs. Raymond Brown of New York, Miss\r\nMelinda Scott of Newark, treasurer of the National Women's Trade Union\r\nLeague, and Judge William H. Wood of New York. Dr. Hussey told of\r\n10,000 leaflets distributed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Feickert described the successful house-to-house canvass in\r\nJersey City by Miss Pope and herself, by which the membership had\r\nincreased to 1,400. Mrs. Decker announced the opening of the first\r\nState headquarters the next week in Newark with a volunteer committee\r\nin charge, Mrs. George G. Scott, chairman. Mrs. Vernona H. Henry of\r\nNewark was elected recording secretary and no other change was made in\r\nthe board, most of whom had served over ten years. With the\r\ncooperation of all the societies the meeting at the auditorium in\r\nNewark addressed by Mrs. Emmeline Pankhurst of England was a great\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nThis record of details, much condensed, represents the seed-sowing in\r\nthe first decade of the century in preparation for the harvest which\r\ncame at the end of the second decade.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW JERSEY. PART II.[120]\r\n\r\nIn December, 1911, a Joint Legislative Committee, representing the\r\nfour woman suffrage organizations in New Jersey was formed with Mrs.\r\nGeorge T. Vickers as chairman, and in January, 1912, a resolution for\r\na submission to the voters of a woman suffrage amendment to the State\r\nconstitution was first introduced in the Legislature at the request of\r\nthis committee.\r\n\r\nOn Oct. 25, 1912, a parade was given in Newark under the auspices of\r\nthe State Suffrage Association with all four organizations represented\r\namong the marchers, who numbered about 1,000 men and women. This was\r\nfollowed by a well-attended mass meeting at Proctor's Theater,\r\narranged by the Women's Political Union, at which Dr. Anna Howard\r\nShaw, president of the National Suffrage Association, was the\r\nprincipal speaker.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-second annual convention of the association was held in\r\nTrenton in November, when the following officers were elected:\r\nPresident, Mrs. E. F. Feickert; first vice-president, Mrs. F. H.\r\nColvin; second, Miss Elinor Gebhardt; corresponding secretary, Mrs.\r\nCharles P. Titus; recording secretary, Mrs. Charles P. Eaton;\r\ntreasurer, Mrs. Anna B. Jeffery; auditor, Miss Bessie Pope.\r\nTwenty-five local branches were reported with a total membership of\r\n2,200.\r\n\r\nIn December the Legislative Committee was re-organized on the basis of\r\nequal representation for each of the four organizations. Mrs. Everett\r\nColby was elected chairman and Mrs. Minnie J. Reynolds was engaged as\r\nlegislative secretary, who resigned in six months to become field\r\norganizer for the Women's Political Union. This committee continued to\r\nfunction until 1917, when the Women's Political Union, the Equal\r\nFranchise Society and the Men's League having disbanded and their\r\nbranches having joined the State association the political work was\r\ntaken over by its Legislative Committee. In 1914 Mrs. Philip McKim\r\nGarrison succeeded Mrs. Colby and she was succeeded by Mrs. Robert S.\r\nHuse in 1916. Among those who served actively were Miss Bessie Pope,\r\nwho gave valuable and continuous service to the completion of\r\nsuffrage work in 1920; Champlain Lord Riley, William L. Saunders,\r\nEverett Colby, Mrs. Mina C. Van Winkle, Mrs. Reynolds, Mrs R. T.\r\nNewton, Miss Belle Tiffany, Mrs. Colvin, Mrs. James Billington and\r\nMrs. Feickert.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1913, the Women's Political Union held its first State\r\nconference, at which the following officers were elected: President,\r\nMrs. Van Winkle; vice-presidents, Miss Julia S. Hurlbut, Mrs. E. T.\r\nLukens, Mrs. H. R. Reed, Mrs. W. H. Gardner, Miss Edna C. Wyckoff,\r\nMrs. R. T. Newton, Miss Louise Antrim, Mrs. Carl Vail, Miss Louise\r\nConnolly; recording secretary, Miss Sara Crowell; executive secretary,\r\nMrs. Reynolds; financial secretary, Mrs. Amelia Moorfield; treasurer,\r\nMrs. Stewart Hartshorne. This was the only state-wide conference held\r\nuntil after the referendum election in 1915 and these officers\r\ncontinued to serve. The Equal Franchise Society's president, Mrs.\r\nVickers, served from 1911 until it disbanded in 1915. Other active\r\nmembers were Mrs. H. Otto Wittpen and Mrs. Mary B. Kinsley.\r\n\r\nOn March 25, 1913, the State association held a jubilee mass meeting\r\nin Newark to celebrate submission of a State suffrage amendment by the\r\nLegislature. This spring it held a large and successful school for\r\nsuffrage workers in Newark and the expenses of two volunteer\r\norganizers were paid for several months, Mrs. U. L. Decker and Miss\r\nDille Hastings. In August its representatives took part in the\r\ndemonstration at Washington, arranged by the National Congressional\r\nCommittee, when petitions were presented to the Senate asking for the\r\nimmediate submission of the Federal Amendment, Mrs. Champlain Lord\r\nRiley, Mrs. Colvin, Miss Helen Lippincott, Miss Edith Abbott and Mrs.\r\nFeickert. The New Jersey petitions of several thousand names were\r\nunwillingly presented by Senator James E. Martine, who made a speech\r\nagainst woman suffrage at the same time.\r\n\r\nAt the annual convention held in Newark in November reports showed\r\nthat the membership had more than doubled during the year, there being\r\nnow 44 local branches with over 6,000 members. Three changes took\r\nplace in the board, Miss Lippincott, elected second vice-president;\r\nMrs. Edward Olmsted, treasurer and Mrs. Arthur Hunter, auditor. Just\r\nafter this convention a delegation of 58 from the association and 17\r\nfrom the Political Union went to Washington at the request of the\r\nNational Congressional Committee to interview President Wilson in\r\nbehalf of favorable action on the Federal Amendment by the House of\r\nRepresentatives. The committee could not arrange for a special\r\ninterview but finally saw him by going to the White House at the hour\r\nset aside for the reception of the general public and made their\r\nrequest. The President was cordial and said that he was giving the\r\nmatter careful consideration and hoped soon to take a decided stand\r\nwhich he thought the suffragists would find satisfactory. The speakers\r\nwere its chairman, Mrs. Feickert, Mrs. Van Winkle and Miss Melinda\r\nScott, who represented the organized working women of New Jersey.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1914, the State headquarters were transferred to Plainfield,\r\nthe home of the president, who took charge of them. Board meetings\r\nwere held in different sections of the State each month, followed by\r\nopen conferences for suffragists from the nearby towns. Each of these\r\nwas attended by from 50 to 250 and resulted in greatly increased\r\nactivity in the branches. During the summer a number of county\r\nautomobile tours were made, a \"flying squadron\" of decorated cars\r\ngoing from town to town, holding meetings and distributing literature.\r\nThese tours were well worked up and advertised and very successful. A\r\ngreat deal of the work connected with them was done by Miss Florence\r\nHalsey, a volunteer field organizer.\r\n\r\nDuring July a week of suffrage meetings was held in Asbury Park, the\r\nauditorium there given free on condition that there should be debates\r\nand not merely presentations of suffrage. Over a hundred columns of\r\npublicity were secured for them in the New Jersey papers and during\r\nthe week the hotels of Asbury Park and nearby resorts were canvassed\r\nand thousands of leaflets and circulars given out. This year over\r\n300,000 pieces of literature were distributed by the State association\r\nand the Political Union. A weekly press service was established by the\r\nassociation and news bulletins and special stories were sent regularly\r\nto over one hundred papers. The local branches of the association\r\nincreased to 96 and of the Political Union to 15, with a membership of\r\n22,000 and 4,000 respectively. At the annual convention of the\r\nassociation held in Camden in November the new officers elected were,\r\nsecond vice-president, Mrs. Robert P. Finley; corresponding secretary,\r\nMrs. Bayard Naylor; recording secretary, Mrs. L. H. Cummings. All\r\nattention and action were centered on the approaching campaign.\r\n\r\nThe resolution to submit the amendment had passed two Legislatures and\r\nwas to go to the voters at a special election Oct. 19, 1915. A\r\nCooperative Committee was formed of three from the State association\r\nand the Women's Political Union each and one each from the Equal\r\nFranchise Society and the Men's League. A Committee of One Hundred was\r\nalso organized to raise money for the campaign, Mrs. Colby chairman.\r\nIt obtained $9,000 which were used for the expenses of the Press\r\nCommittee, that had its office at the National Suffrage headquarters\r\nin New York, for news bulletins every day, plate matter, interviews,\r\nstories, advertising cards and posters in the trolley cars and the\r\nstations of the Hudson Tunnels system; illuminated signs and street\r\nbanners in New Jersey cities and a half-page advertisement in all the\r\npapers of the State at the end of the campaign. The executive\r\nsecretary was Mrs. Flora Gapen Charters. The total amount of money\r\nraised and spent by the State and local organizations was\r\napproximately $80,000, obtained by dues and pledges, by collections at\r\nmass meetings, special luncheons and very largely by personal\r\ncontributions from men and women.\r\n\r\nThe State association increased to 200 branches in twenty-four cities.\r\nThe Political Union maintained a large headquarters in Newark. Over\r\n3,000,000 pieces of literature and 400,000 buttons were distributed.\r\nThe association circularized all the women's organizations of the\r\nState, the fraternal organizations, clergymen, grange officers,\r\nlawyers, office-holders and other special groups. Speakers were sent\r\nto grange picnics and county fairs. Street meetings took place\r\nregularly in all the principal cities and towns and automobile tours\r\nover the State. Over 4,000 outdoor and 500 indoor meetings were held.\r\nFour paid and thirty volunteer organizers were kept in the field for\r\neight months.\r\n\r\nThe association arranged a conference of the leaders of the four\r\ncampaign States, New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and New Jersey,\r\nwhich was held in East Orange in connection with the celebration on\r\nAugust 13 of the birthday of its founder, Lucy Stone. There was a\r\npilgrimage of suffragists from almost every county, and, after\r\nexercises at her old home and the unveiling by her daughter, Alice\r\nStone Blackwell, of a tablet placed in front of the house, there was\r\nan automobile parade through the nearby towns, winding up with a mass\r\nmeeting in the park in East Orange, where Dr. Shaw and ex-Governor\r\nJohn Franklin Fort were the principal speakers.\r\n\r\nThe Women's Political Union conducted a \"handing on the torch\"\r\ndemonstration which was quite effective. The New York Union supplied a\r\nlarge torch of bronze, which Mrs. H. O. Havemeyer, representing New\r\nYork, took with her on a tugboat half way across the Hudson River,\r\nwhere she was met by a New Jersey tug bearing Mrs. Van Winkle, to whom\r\nthe torch was delivered. It was sent about the State to twenty or more\r\ntowns where the Union had branches and its arrival was made the\r\noccasion for an outdoor reception and mass meeting.\r\n\r\nThe Women's Anti-Suffrage Association was also busy. It paid the\r\nsalaries and expenses of two New Jersey speakers, Mrs. O. D. Oliphant\r\nof Trenton and John A. Matthews of Newark, an ex-Assemblyman, and\r\nbrought in a number of outside speakers. It never claimed to have more\r\nthan fifteen local branches and 18,000 members. Among the more\r\nprominent were the president, Mrs. E. Yarde Breese of Plainfield; Mrs.\r\nThomas J. Preston, Mrs. Garrett A. Hobart, Mrs. Carroll P. Bassett,\r\nMiss Anna Dayton, Robert C. Maxwell, Miss Clara A. Vezin, Mrs.\r\nHamilton F. Kean, Mrs. Alexander F. Jamieson, Mrs. Charles W.\r\nMacQuoid, Mrs. Thomas B. Adams, Miss Anne McIlvaine and Mrs. Sherman\r\nB. Joost.\r\n\r\nJames R. Nugent of Newark, prominent as the champion of the \"wets\" and\r\nthe \"antis,\" paid the salary of Edward J. Handley, an ex-newspaperman\r\nof Newark, and gave him a suite of offices in the Wise building with\r\nseveral clerks. His \"publicity\" kept the amendment on the front pages\r\nof the papers and the suffragists were always able to refute and\r\ndisprove his statements. The intensive campaign carried on among the\r\neditors for the past two or three years bore fruit and 80 per cent. of\r\nthe newspapers by actual canvass favored the amendment, and frequently\r\nwhen the front page carried a story against suffrage it was\r\ncontradicted on the editorial page. Among editors who were\r\nparticularly strong friends were James Kerney and John E. Sines of the\r\nTrenton _Evening Times_; Joseph A. Dear and Julius Grunow of the\r\nJersey City _Journal_; John L. Matthews of the Paterson _Press\r\nGuardian_; George M. Hart of the Passaic _Daily News_; the Boyds of\r\nthe New Brunswick _Home News_; J. L. Clevenger of the Perth Amboy\r\n_Evening News_; William H. Fischer of the New Jersey _Courier_; George\r\nW. Swift of the Elizabeth _Daily Journal_ and E. A. Bristor of the\r\nPassaic _Herald_.\r\n\r\nThree weeks before the election President Wilson announced himself in\r\nfavor of the amendment, and he and his private secretary, Joseph P.\r\nTumulty, made a special trip to New Jersey to vote for it. This had a\r\nmarked effect over the country.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Committee having secured a bill allowing women to\r\nwatch at the polls, watchers' schools were held in every important\r\ncity under the direction of Mrs. Colvin, with the result that at the\r\nelection 1,657 of the 1,891 polling places in the State were supplied\r\nwith trained women watchers.\r\n\r\nOn election day Nugent and his lieutenants worked all day at the\r\nNewark polling places and the suffragists were positive that hundreds\r\nof voters were imported from New York and other places, which was\r\npossible because men could vote on the amendment without having\r\npreviously registered. Nugent is reported to have said: \"We knew we\r\nhad the amendment beaten when the election was put on registration\r\nday.\" This was done against the protests of the suffragists. Men voted\r\non it at the same time they registered and in the police canvass made\r\nbefore the general election, the names of several thousand illegally\r\nregistered were taken off the books in Essex and Hudson counties, all\r\nof whom had a chance to vote on the amendment. All day in all the\r\ncities the women watchers saw little groups of men taken into saloons\r\nopposite the polling places by persons avowedly working to defeat it,\r\ninstructed how to vote on it, marshalled to the polling place and\r\nafter voting taken back to the saloon to be paid.\r\n\r\nFinding at the last moment that no provision was made by the State to\r\npay for sending in returns from special elections, the State\r\nassociation arranged with the Associated Press to obtain its own\r\nreturns and a wire was run into the suffrage headquarters in Jersey\r\nCity. By midnight complete returns were in from 70 per cent. of the\r\nState, due to the splendid cooperation of the county and local\r\nsuffrage chairmen, who knew only one day in advance that this work\r\nwould be required of them. A manager of the Associated Press said that\r\nthey had never handled an election where the returns came in faster or\r\nmore accurately and few where they came in as well.\r\n\r\nThe election resulted in a vote of 317,672, a very large one\r\nconsidering that the Presidential vote in 1912 had been only 459,000.\r\nThe vote in favor of the suffrage amendment was 133,281, or 42 per\r\ncent. of the whole; against, 184,391, defeated by 51,110. Ocean county\r\nwas the only one carried but 126 cities and towns were carried and a\r\nnumber of counties gave from 46 to 49 per cent. in favor.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks after their defeat several hundred New Jersey suffragists\r\nwent to New York and Philadelphia to march in the suffrage parades,\r\ntaking the biggest and best band in the State and carrying at the head\r\nof their division a runner twenty feet long reading: New\r\nJersey--Delayed but not Defeated.\r\n\r\nThe State convention of 1915 was postponed until January, 1916, when\r\nit was held in Elizabeth. There were then 215 local branches with a\r\nmembership of over 50,000. No discouragement was visible but a program\r\nof educational work and intensive organization was adopted, money was\r\npledged for the salaries of three field organizers and it was decided\r\nto have a bill for Presidential suffrage introduced in the\r\nLegislature. Mrs. Ward D. Kerlin, second vice-president, was the only\r\nnew officer elected. A new constitution was adopted putting the\r\nassociation on a non-dues-paying basis, providing for an annual budget\r\nand re-organization of the State by congressional districts.\r\n\r\nIn June New Jersey was represented at the National Republican\r\nconvention in Chicago by Mrs. Feickert, Miss Esther G. Ogden, Mrs. E.\r\nG. Blaisdell, Miss A. E. Cameron and Mrs. Joseph Marvel. All of the\r\nNew Jersey delegates were interviewed and twelve of the twenty-eight\r\npromised to support a suffrage plank in the platform.\r\n\r\nIn July the Women's Political Union disbanded and its local branches\r\njoined the State association. The national suffrage convention held\r\nat Atlantic City in September gave a great impetus to the State work.\r\nThe annual convention met in Jersey City in November, where it was\r\ndecided to conduct a strenuous campaign during 1917 for Presidential\r\nsuffrage and for the Federal Amendment and to employ four field\r\norganizers. The new officers elected were Mrs. John J. White, Miss\r\nLulu H. Marvel, Mrs. J. Thompson Baker, vice-presidents; Miss Anita\r\nStill, auditor. The Rev. Antoinette Brown Blackwell and Dr. Mary D.\r\nHussey were added to the list of honorary presidents.\r\n\r\nA bill for Presidential suffrage was introduced in the Legislature in\r\nFebruary, 1917, and everything was going finely when war was declared.\r\nThe suffrage association was the first women's organization in the\r\nState to offer its services to the Governor and was publicly thanked\r\nby him for its patriotic stand. At his request it conducted a canvass\r\nof women nurses, doctors and clerical workers and received letters of\r\nthanks from him and the Adjutant General for this very successful\r\npiece of work. It cooperated in the organization of a Woman's Division\r\nof the State Council of National Defense and its president, Mrs.\r\nFeickert, was vice-chairman of the Council. The association purchased\r\nand operated a Soldiers' Club House and canteen in the town of\r\nWrightstown, near which Camp Dix was located. It was opened in\r\nNovember, 1917, and was kept open until June, 1919, by volunteer\r\nworkers. Over $30,000 were raised for it, one-fifth of this amount\r\nbeing contributed by Mrs. White. More than 250,000 men were\r\nentertained there. Officers and members of the association responded\r\nto all demands of the war.\r\n\r\nThe annual convention was held in the Capitol at Trenton in November.\r\nReports showed that only thirty of the hundreds of local branches had\r\ndropped suffrage work because of their war activities, and the spirit\r\nwas one of determination that the battle for real democracy in the\r\nUnited States should be kept up just as actively as the war against\r\nautocracy abroad. Mrs. Wells P. Eagleton was elected a vice-president,\r\nMrs. E. G. Blaisdell a secretary and Mrs. F. W. Veghte an auditor. The\r\nState Federation of Colored Women's Clubs was accepted as an\r\naffiliated organization and its president, the Rev. Florence Randolph,\r\nwas made a member of the State Board. The convention voted to make\r\nits special work for the year the collecting of a monster petition of\r\nwomen, to be so worded that it could be used in Congressional work for\r\nthe Federal Amendment and with the Legislature for ratification.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1918 U. S. Senator William Hughes, who was pledged to\r\nvote for the Federal Amendment, died and the candidate for the office\r\nwas David Baird, a strong anti-suffragist. As only one more vote in\r\nthe Senate was needed to pass the amendment the National Association\r\nasked the New Jersey association to do its best to defeat him. An\r\nactive campaign was carried on for two months but he was too powerful\r\na party leader, though he ran 9,000 votes behind the rest of the\r\nticket. He voted against the amendment every time it came before the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nBecause of the Baird campaign and the general unsettled feeling around\r\nthe time of the signing of the armistice the annual convention was\r\npostponed to May, 1919, when it was held in Atlantic City. The\r\nratification petitions collected the preceding year had over 80,000\r\nnames of women not previously enrolled as suffragists. Mrs. H. N.\r\nSimmons, vice-president, and Mrs. F. T. Kellers, auditor, were the\r\nonly new officers elected. It was voted that the other State\r\norganizations of women should be asked to join in the campaign for\r\nratification of the Federal Amendment by the Legislature. The\r\ncommittee was organized in July, 1918, with the following\r\norganizations represented: Woman Suffrage Association, Federation of\r\nWomen's Clubs, Federation of Colored Women's Clubs, Woman's Christian\r\nTemperance Union, Public Health Nursing, Teachers' Association;\r\nchairman, Mrs. Feickert; secretary, Mrs. James Simister; treasurer,\r\nMrs. Olmsted. A Finance Committee was appointed--Mrs. Seymour L.\r\nCromwell, Mrs. Colby and Mrs. Hunter--which raised over $10,000. The\r\nprincipal contributors were Mrs. Cromwell, Mrs. Colby, Judge and Mrs.\r\nJohn J. White, Mrs. Wittpenn, Mrs. Hartshorne, Mrs. Lewis S. Thompson\r\nand Mrs. Robert Stevens.\r\n\r\nA very active primary and general election campaign was made in 1919\r\nfor the election of men pledged to vote for ratification, in which\r\n110,000 personal letters were sent out, all kinds of organizations\r\nwere circularized and about 1,000,000 pieces of literature were\r\ndistributed. A State ratification mass meeting at Asbury Park in\r\nAugust opened the campaign and local meetings were held in every\r\ncounty. A Governor and a majority in both Houses were elected who were\r\npledged to ratification.\r\n\r\nA Men's Council for Ratification was organized in December with\r\nEverett Colby as chairman, Governor Edward I. Edwards and U. S.\r\nSenators Joseph S. Frelinghuysen and Walter E. Edge as honorary\r\nchairmen and 54 of the most prominent Democrats and Republicans in the\r\nState as vice-chairmen. This was not an active organization but the\r\nfact that the leaders of their parties allowed their names to be used\r\nhad considerable influence upon many legislators. In January, 1920,\r\ncampaign headquarters were opened in Trenton near the State House in\r\ncharge of Miss Julia Wernig, field organizer of the association, where\r\na great deal of literature was given out and other work done.\r\n\r\nOn January 27 in Crescent Temple, Trenton, the Ratification Committee\r\nstaged the most spectacular suffrage mass meeting ever held in New\r\nJersey. Its special purpose was to present to the Governor, the\r\nPresident of the Senate and the Speaker of the House the huge suffrage\r\npetition containing almost 140,000 names of women, arranged by\r\ncounties and towns. The hall was beautifully decorated with American\r\nflags and suffrage banners and a fine band played at intervals. The\r\nspeakers were Governor Edwards, President of the Senate Clarence E.\r\nCase, Speaker of the Assembly W. Irving Glover and Mrs. Carrie Chapman\r\nCatt, president of the National Suffrage Association. The twenty-one\r\ncounty chairmen and representatives of the women's organizations\r\ncomposing the committee were seated on the platform and at the proper\r\ntime each came forward with her petitions and was presented to the\r\nGovernor and the legislative officials by Mrs. Feickert, who presided.\r\nAbout 1,200 women and most of the Legislature were present and there\r\nwas much enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. The Federal Suffrage Amendment was submitted by Congress\r\nJune 4, 1919. The resolution for ratification was the first measure\r\nintroduced when the Legislature convened in 1920, by Senator William\r\nB. MacKay, Jr., of Bergen county and Assemblyman Henry G. Hershfield\r\nof Passaic county. A public hearing was held February 2 with Mrs.\r\nFeickert chairman. The principal suffrage speakers were U. S. Senator\r\nSelden Spencer of Missouri, Mrs. Robert S. Huse, Mrs. Harriman N.\r\nSimons and the Rev. Florence Randolph. Each of five others\r\nrepresenting various women's organizations spoke for two minutes. That\r\nday the Senate ratified by 18 ayes, 2 noes, two men voting in favor\r\nwho had been pledged against it.\r\n\r\nThe opposition then concentrated its efforts upon the Assembly, where\r\nvarious tricks were played which in the end were unsuccessful. U. S.\r\nAttorney General A. Mitchell Palmer had written to each of the\r\nDemocratic members urging his support. The evening that ratification\r\nwas to be voted on, February 9, the chamber was jammed and it was\r\nevident that the opposition intended to \"filibuster\" all night rather\r\nthan allow the resolution to pass. One motion after another was made\r\nby the leader of the opposition, Assemblyman Hugh Barrett of Essex,\r\nNugent's special representative, and after a hot fight and much\r\ntalking they were defeated. Mr. Nugent was outside in the corridor\r\nconstantly sending in messages to his delegation and it was understood\r\nthat he was offering anything the Assemblymen might ask for their\r\nvotes against ratification. The women suffragists were present in\r\nforce helping their friends to maintain their determination to vote on\r\nthe resolution that night. It was a stormy session, the \"filibuster\"\r\ngoing on steadily from 8 p. m. Finally the opposition gave up the\r\nfight and at ten minutes to 1 o'clock in the morning the Assembly\r\npassed the resolution by 34 ayes, 24 noes. The gallery was still\r\nfilled with women, who were most enthusiastic.\r\n\r\nThe resolution was signed promptly by the President of the Senate and\r\nthe Speaker of the House and the Governor sent it to Washington by a\r\nspecial messenger. The suffragists felt especially indebted to\r\nSenators William N. Runyon, C. D. White and Arthur Whitney and to\r\nAssemblymen William A. Blair, Emmor Roberts, Henry G. Hershfield and\r\nWilliam George for their work in party caucuses as well as on the\r\nfloor. Governor Edwards and Mayor Frank Hague of Jersey City (the\r\nDemocratic leader of the State) were responsible for the solid vote of\r\nall the Democrats except those under the control of Nugent. U. S.\r\nSenators Frelinghuysen and Edge and Attorney General McCran also\r\nrendered most valuable assistance.\r\n\r\nThe State Suffrage Association celebrated the successful termination\r\nof its over fifty years of continuous effort by a Victory Convention\r\nheld in Newark on April 23, 24. Leading features were a Victory\r\nbanquet with prominent men of both political parties as speakers, and\r\na Pioneers' luncheon, at which Dr. Mary D. Hussey, Mrs. Florence Howe\r\nHall, Mrs. Minola Graham Sexton, Mrs. Clara S. Laddey and other early\r\nworkers spoke. Before the close of the convention the State League of\r\nWomen Voters was organized to carry on the work for good government\r\nand better conditions through the use of the power which had been\r\nsecured for them by the older association. Mrs. John R. Schermerhorn\r\nwas elected chairman.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION: 1912. The first resolution for the submission of a\r\nwoman suffrage amendment to the voters was introduced in February by\r\nSenator William C. Gebhardt in the Senate and Assemblyman A. R.\r\nMcAllister in the House. A public hearing was held on March 12 at\r\nwhich Mrs. Vickers presided and the speakers for the suffrage side\r\nwere Mrs. Hall, Mrs. Henry Villard, Mrs. Charlotte Perkins Gilman,\r\nMrs. Clara S. Laddey, George T. Vickers and Linton Satterthwaite. Miss\r\nAnna Dayton presided for the \"antis\" and Mrs. E. N. Loomis was their\r\nprincipal speaker. The vote in the Senate was 18 noes, 3\r\nayes--Senators Gebhardt of Hunterdon county, J. Warren Davis of Salem\r\nand G. W. F. Gaunt of Gloucester. In the Assembly the resolution was\r\nfinally forced out of an unfavorable committee but was tabled by a\r\nvote of 31 ayes, 19 noes.\r\n\r\n1913. In January the resolution was introduced by Senator J. Warren\r\nDavis and Assemblyman Charles M. Egan. A hearing was held February 18\r\nat which Mrs. Everett Colby presided and the speakers were Dr. Anna\r\nHoward Shaw, president of the National American Suffrage Association;\r\nU. S. Senator Shafroth of Colorado, Everett Colby, George La Monte and\r\nCornelius Ford, president of the State Federation of Labor. The\r\nresolution passed the Senate by 14 ayes, 5 noes, and the Assembly by\r\n45 ayes, 5 noes. A few weeks later it was discovered that the word\r\n\"or\" appeared in the printed resolution instead of \"and,\" making it\r\nnecessary to have a new one introduced, which went through by the same\r\nvote.\r\n\r\nThe New Jersey law in regard to constitutional amendments provides\r\nthat after being submitted by one Legislature they must be advertised\r\nin every county for three months prior to the next election, acted\r\nupon favorably by the succeeding Legislature and then voted on at a\r\nspecial election, the date of which it decides. After the passage of\r\nthe referendum resolution in 1913 the Legislative Committee took up\r\nwith the Secretary of State the matter of advertising and were assured\r\nthat it would be attended to and they could go home and \"forget it,\"\r\nwhich they trustingly did. When no advertisements appeared members of\r\nthe committee hurried to Trenton and learned that Governor James F.\r\nFielder was responsible. His excuse was that his secretary had mislaid\r\nthe resolution and forgotten to remind him of it.\r\n\r\n1914. The resolution was introduced in January by Senator Charles M.\r\nEgan and Assemblyman Joseph M. Branegan, both of Hudson county. It\r\npassed the Senate by 15 ayes, 3 noes, and the Assembly by 49 ayes, 4\r\nnoes.\r\n\r\n1915. The advertising was properly done for this year and the\r\nresolution came up for second passage in January, introduced by\r\nSenator Blanchard H. White and Assemblyman Robert Peacock, both of\r\nBurlington county. A hearing was held January 25, Mrs. Philip McKim\r\nGarrison chairman and speakers Dr. Shaw, E. G. C. Bleakley, city\r\ncounsel of Camden; Mrs. Reynolds and Mrs. Feickert. The Senate passed\r\nthe resolution by 17 ayes, 4 noes, and the Assembly by unanimous vote.\r\n\r\n1916. A bill for Presidential suffrage for women was introduced by\r\nSenator Charles O'Connor Hennessy of Bergen county and was lost by a\r\nvote of 10 noes, 3 ayes--Senators Hennessy, Austen Colgate of Essex\r\ncounty and Carlton B. Pierce of Union county. No effort was made to\r\npress the bill in the Assembly.\r\n\r\n1917. Another bill for Presidential suffrage was introduced by Senator\r\nEdmund B. Osborne of Essex county and Assemblyman Roy M. Robinson of\r\nBergen. In both Houses the presiding officers were strongly opposed to\r\nwoman suffrage and put the bill into unfavorable committees, who\r\nrefused to report it for action. A hearing was held with Mrs. Robert\r\nS. Huse chairman and Mrs. Antoinette Funk the chief speaker. Finally\r\nby using what is known as the \"rule of fifteen,\" in the Assembly its\r\nfriends got the bill out of committee on March 15 but with an\r\nunfavorable report. Majority leader Oliphant moved that the House\r\nconcur and Speaker Edward Schoen of Essex county ruled that the motion\r\nwas carried. Many members demanded a roll call but the Speaker paid no\r\nattention to them. Pandemonium reigned, members shouting and banging\r\ntheir desks until finally he declared a recess and fled to his private\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n1918. It was hoped that the Federal Amendment would be submitted in\r\nthe spring and it was decided not to complicate ratification by\r\nintroducing a Presidential suffrage bill. In February a bill providing\r\nthat the Legislature should not act on the ratification of Federal\r\nAmendments until after they had been referred to the voters was\r\nintroduced by Assemblyman Arthur N. Pierson of Union county. It was\r\ndesigned especially to prevent action on the Prohibition Amendment but\r\nwould also apply to the one for woman suffrage. The Legislative\r\nCommittee went at once to Trenton, where the Anti-Saloon workers were\r\nalready busy. Sufficient force was brought to keep the bill in\r\ncommittee for three weeks, at the end of which time 46 votes were\r\npledged against it and it was killed in committee at the request of\r\nits introducer. In 1919 a similar bill was introduced by Assemblyman\r\nDavid Young of Morris county but the suffragists made so strong a\r\ndemonstration against it that it was killed in committee.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[118] The History is indebted for this chapter to Dr. Mary D. Hussey,\r\na founder of the State Woman Suffrage Association in 1890 and\r\ncontinuously an officer for the next twenty years.\r\n\r\n[119] Afterwards Mr. Riley became president and Arthur B. Jones,\r\nsecretary. Among the League's prominent members were the Hon. Everett\r\nColby, Governor John Franklin Fort, J. A. H. Hopkins, Jesse Lynch\r\nWilliams, Charles O'Connor Hennessy, the Hon. John W. Westcott, the\r\nRev. Dr. Arthur E. Ballard, the Rev. Edgar S. Weirs, Colonel George\r\nHarvey, the Hon. Edmond B. Osbourne, the Hon. Ernest R. Ackerman,\r\nEmerson P. Harris, Richard Stevens, the Hon. James C. Connally and\r\nMayor Victor Mavalag of Elizabeth. They passed resolutions\r\n\"reaffirming their sympathy with the great world movement for woman\r\nsuffrage\"; \"heartily approved\" of the Federal Amendment; pledged their\r\n\"untiring support\" of the State referendum; spoke at legislative\r\nhearings; raised money; addressed meetings; appointed a State\r\ncommittee of 63 members which met monthly; appointed a committee with\r\nGeorge M. Strobell, chairman, that marched in the parade in Newark,\r\nOct. 25, 1913; held a mass meeting in Elizabeth at which Mayor George\r\nL. LaMonte and Mrs. Forbes-Robertson Hale spoke, and helped in many\r\nways.\r\n\r\n[120] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Lillian F.\r\nFeickert, president of the State Woman Suffrage Association 1912-1920.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nNEW MEXICO.[121]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the railroads were few and automobiles almost unknown in New Mexico\r\nin the first decade of the present century, and as the distances were\r\ngreat and cities and towns widely separated, there was no attempt to\r\norganize for woman suffrage. In 1910 the Women's Clubs were called in\r\nconvention at Las Cruces through the efforts of Mrs. George W.\r\nFrenger, secretary of the General Federation, and Mrs. Philip North\r\nMoore, then its president, was in attendance. A State Federation was\r\nformed with Mrs. S. P. Johnson of Palomas Springs, president; Mrs. Sam\r\nJ. Nixon of Portales secretary, and several department chairmen were\r\nnamed, Mrs. W. E. Lindsey being chosen for the Legislative Department.\r\n\r\nThis department through its bold stand for woman suffrage and better\r\nlaws for women and children easily became the foremost factor in the\r\nfederation. At each yearly convention one evening was given to the\r\ndiscussion of the benefits which women would receive from the\r\nsuffrage. Almost before it was realized suffrage had become popular\r\nwith both men and women. The delegates carried the messages from the\r\nState conventions to their own clubs; suffrage discussions became the\r\nregular program for one meeting each year in almost every club and\r\ngenerally made converts of those taking the opposition. Women began\r\nsearching the statutes and questioning their attorneys and husbands in\r\nregard to laws. Their interest became such that no Legislature during\r\nthe federation's existence has proposed any law derogatory to the\r\nrights of women and children, but when attention has been called to\r\nunfair laws, some of them have been replaced by better ones.\r\n\r\nUnder direction of the executive board of the federation this\r\ndepartment sent out questionnaires to all of the State candidates for\r\noffice in 1916 as to whether they would work for placing women on the\r\nState boards and use their influence to bring the Federal Amendment to\r\na successful vote in the United States Senate and House. Their members\r\nwere also interrogated as to whether they would work and vote for it.\r\nTherefore the Legislative Department of the Federated Clubs really did\r\nthe work that any suffrage organization would do and had the backing\r\nof the women of the State in general. Suffrage was unanimously\r\nendorsed in the convention of the federation at Silver City in 1914.\r\nIt is to the credit of the work of the Federated Clubs in the State\r\nthat its members of Congress, with one exception, have needed no\r\nlobbying from suffrage forces in Washington. Senator Andrieus A.\r\nJones, as chairman of the Suffrage Committee, made the submission of\r\nthe amendment possible in the present Congress by his systematic and\r\nforceful course in the last one.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lindsey remained chairman of this department six years. In 1913\r\nshe was appointed State chairman for the National American Woman\r\nSuffrage Association by its president, Dr. Anna Howard Shaw. In 1914\r\nthe suffragists had a \"float\" in the parade at the State fair in\r\nAlbuquerque. In May, 1916, the National Association under the\r\npresidency of Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, sent one of its organizers,\r\nMiss Lola Walker of Pittsburgh, for ten days to look over the\r\nsituation and she visited Albuquerque, Santa Fé, Portales and Las\r\nVegas. In the last place she spoke before the Woman's Club with about\r\neighty present and at the close of her talk a vote was taken which\r\nstood unanimous for suffrage. At Portales a society was formed and a\r\nlarge evening reception was held to which both men and women were\r\ninvited. Miss Walker gave a very interesting résumé of woman suffrage\r\nwhich aroused much interest. An appeal was sent to the National\r\nAssociation to return her for a fall campaign to organize the State as\r\nan auxiliary. She went to Maine, however, and Miss Gertrude Watkins of\r\nLittle Rock was sent to New Mexico in January, 1917. She visited the\r\neastern and central parts of the State organizing leagues in most of\r\nthe towns. In Santa Fé one was formed of about thirty members with\r\nMrs. Paul A. F. Walter president; Mrs. R. W. Twitchell secretary, and\r\nMrs. Ellen J. Palen treasurer.\r\n\r\nThe Congressional Union also sent an organizer into the State in 1916,\r\nMrs. Thompson, who spent some time in Santa Fé, Albuquerque and Las\r\nVegas. The Santa Fé women were sufficiently aroused to hold a street\r\nparade and march to the home of U. S. Senator Catron, an opponent,\r\nwhere they gathered on the lawn and made speeches to convince the aged\r\nSenator of the wishes of the women as to his conduct in the Senate.\r\nMrs. Joshua Reynolds was made State chairman of the Congressional\r\nUnion and afterwards Mrs. Nina Otero Warren, and Mrs. A. A. Kellan was\r\nlegislative chairman, all of Albuquerque. Miss Mabel Vernon came from\r\nWashington to hold meetings that year and Miss Anne Martin in 1917,\r\nand active work was done.\r\n\r\nWashington E. Lindsey was Governor in 1917-18, and in November, 1918,\r\nall the suffrage forces in Albuquerque and Santa Fé were invited by\r\nMrs. Lindsey to meet at the Executive Mansion and form a committee to\r\nwork for suffrage at the coming session of the Legislature. This\r\nmeeting elected the following officers: Mrs. R. P. Barnes chairman;\r\nMrs. A. B. Stroup secretary; Mrs. Warren legislative chairman; Mrs.\r\nJohn W. Wilson party platform chairman; Mrs. Walter congressional\r\nchairman. This committee did good work for suffrage in both the\r\nregular and special sessions.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1919, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt and her party of speakers\r\nfor the ratification of the Federal Amendment came to Albuquerque for\r\nthe last of several western State conferences. It was arranged by Mrs.\r\nBarnes and was carried out with great success. Mrs. Catt spoke at a\r\nlarge luncheon held in the Y. M. C. A. building, which many of the\r\nJudges, newspaper representatives and other prominent men and women\r\nattended. On account of the great distances few except from\r\nAlbuquerque and Santa Fé were present but Mrs. Catt's appeal was\r\ncarried from one end of the State to the other through the public\r\npress and created an atmosphere of hope. This was changed to rejoicing\r\nas word came that Governor Octaviano A. Larrazolo would call a special\r\nsession of the Legislature for the ratification.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. When the time came the Legislature had adjourned and\r\nwould not meet again until 1921, so a special session would be\r\nnecessary if it ratified before the presidential election. The\r\nopponents concentrated their forces to prevent it and were successful\r\nuntil 1920 but finally were obliged to yield and Governor Larrazolo\r\ncalled the special session for February 16. When it met there was a\r\ndetermined effort by one member, Dan Padillo of Albuquerque, to have a\r\nreferendum to the voters of the State. All the city was up in\r\narms--men's organizations, the Y. W. C. A., the W. C. T. U., the\r\nWoman's Committee, the Woman's Party, individual men and women--until\r\nat last he declared that he would vote for the immediate ratification.\r\nThe vote in the Senate February 18 was 17 ayes, 8 Republicans, 9\r\nDemocrats; 5 noes, all Republicans--Gallegos, Mirabel, Lucero\r\n(Emiliano), Salazar and Sanchez. The vote in the House February 19 was\r\n36 ayes, 23 Republicans, 13 Democrats; 10 noes, 8 Republicans, 2\r\nDemocrats.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. Beginning with 1915 the Federation of Women's\r\nClubs was able to secure some legislation favorable to women and\r\nchildren. In 1916 the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, through its\r\npresident, Mrs. Harriet L. Henderson, had a Prohibition Amendment\r\nendorsed by the State Republican platform which the Legislature\r\nsubmitted to the electors in November, 1917. Both parties, all women's\r\norganizations and everybody of influence from the Governor down worked\r\nwith zeal for its passage. Miss Anna A. Gordon, national president of\r\nthe W. C. T. U., came to the State in October and was a guest at the\r\nconvention of the Federated Clubs in Gallup, which voted unanimously\r\nto give all the time until the election to work for its success, and\r\nparades and much individual effort followed. Women went to the polls\r\nwith their lists of voters, checking them off as they came and then\r\ngoing for those who had not voted. It was carried by 20,000 majority,\r\nthe largest percentage vote ever given by any State for prohibition.\r\n\r\nAs the State constitution rendered it impossible to carry an amendment\r\nfor woman suffrage the women made no attempt to have the Legislature\r\nsubmit one, but in 1917 some of the Representatives brought an\r\namendment resolution before the House, which promptly killed it. As\r\nthe State conventions of both political parties this year had declared\r\nin favor of woman suffrage, the committee appointed at the meeting in\r\nthe Governor's mansion asked for the Presidential and Municipal\r\nfranchise, which the Legislature had power to grant without a\r\nreferendum to the voters. They made a spirited campaign with all the\r\nassistance that Governor Lindsey could give and the suffrage societies\r\nthroughout the State poured in letters upon the legislators. The vote\r\nin the Senate was 9 ayes, 14 noes. Before it was taken in the House a\r\nconference was held in the office of the Governor at the Capitol\r\nattended by the following workers for the bill: Senator Isaac Barth,\r\nNational Committeeman; Charles A. Spiess, Holm O. Bursum, Supreme\r\nJustice Clarence J. Roberts, Charles Springer, Mrs. Kellam, Mrs.\r\nWalter, Mrs. Hughey, chairman of the State suffrage legislative\r\ncommittee; Mrs. Kate Hall, president of the Santa Fé branch of the\r\nCongressional Union; Mrs. N. B. Laughlin and Mrs. Lindsey.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the two political parties admitted that they could not\r\ncontrol their legislators and tried to hold the Spanish-Americans\r\nresponsible. The House voted on the bill March 7, after a loud,\r\ndisorderly and acrimonious debate, 26 noes, 21 ayes. The Speaker\r\nafterwards explained his affirmative vote by saying that he thought it\r\nwas to submit the question to the electors! Of the 29 Republican\r\nmembers 10 voted for the bill; of the 18 Democratic members, 11 voted\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE. The convention to prepare a constitution for statehood,\r\nwhich met in 1910, was the battle ground for School suffrage for\r\nwomen. The question was very seriously debated in the Elective\r\nFranchise Committee, which many times voted it down only to renew it\r\nupon appeal to do so. Mrs. S. F. Culberson, then county school\r\nsuperintendent in Roosevelt county, argued the matter before the\r\ncommittee, and its chairman, Nestor Montoya, cast the deciding vote\r\nfor it to come before the convention. Both Democrats and Republicans\r\nrallied to its support but José D. Sena, Clerk of the Supreme Court, a\r\nmember of the convention, strenuously opposed it and finally carried\r\nit back to be caucused upon by the Republican majority. After a stormy\r\ncaucus it was returned to the convention and passed. The president of\r\nthe convention, Charles A. Spiess, spoke urgently in Committee of the\r\nWhole to save women's eligibility to the county superintendency from\r\nbeing eliminated. The clause gave women the right to vote for school\r\ntrustees, on the issuing of bonds and in the local administration of\r\npublic schools but not for county or State superintendents. It\r\nprovided that \"if a majority of the qualified voters of any school\r\ndistrict shall, not less than thirty days before any school election,\r\npresent a petition to the county commissioners against woman suffrage\r\nin that district it shall be suspended and only renewed by a petition\r\nof the majority!\"\r\n\r\nNo effort could obtain any larger extension of the franchise to women\r\nbut the new State constitution gave universal suffrage to men and\r\ncarefully protected the right to vote of those who could not speak,\r\nread or write either the English or Spanish language. It then provided\r\nthat the suffrage clause could only be amended by having the amendment\r\nsubmitted by a vote of three-fourths of each House of the Legislature.\r\nIn order to be carried, it must have a three-fourths majority of the\r\nhighest number voting at a State election and a two-thirds majority of\r\nthe highest number voting in every county. This was expressly designed\r\nto prevent woman suffrage and it destroyed all possibility of it until\r\nconferred by a Federal Amendment.\r\n\r\nAmong the women who worked for woman suffrage in addition to those\r\nmentioned in the chapter were Mesdames Margaret Cartright, S. F.\r\nCulberson, George W. Carr, Josie Lockard, J. R. Kinyon, H. F. LaBelle,\r\nN. J. Strumquist, Margaret Medler, William J. Barker, Lansing Bloom,\r\nC. E. Mason, R. P. Donahoe, Ruth Skeen, John W. Wilson, S. C. Nutter,\r\nCatherine Patterson, Minnie Byrd, Howard Huey, Alfred Grunsfeld, Edgar\r\nL. Hewett, I. H. Elliot and I. H. Rapp.\r\n\r\nAs all women were fully enfranchised by the Federal Amendment a State\r\nbranch of the National League of Women Voters was formed with Mrs.\r\nGerald Cassidy as chairman.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[121] The History is indebted for this chapter to Deane H. (Mrs.\r\nWashington E.) Lindsey, State chairman of the National Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK.[122]\r\n\r\n\r\nNew York was the cradle of the movement for woman suffrage not only in\r\nthis State but in the world, for here in 1848 was held the first\r\nWomen's Rights Convention in all history. Except during the Civil War\r\nthere was no year after 1850 when one or more such conventions did not\r\ntake place until 1920, when all the women of the United States were\r\nenfranchised by an amendment to the National Constitution. This State\r\nwas the home of the two great leaders for half a century--Elizabeth\r\nCady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. The first appeal ever made to a\r\nLegislature for woman suffrage was made by these two women in 1854 and\r\nthere was never a year afterwards when this appeal was not made by the\r\nwomen of New York except during the Civil War. The State Woman\r\nSuffrage Association was organized in 1869 and its work never ceased.\r\nNotwithstanding this record no suffrage for women had ever been\r\nobtained in this State, except a fragment of a School franchise for\r\nthose in villages and country districts, up to 1901, when this chapter\r\nbegins.\r\n\r\nThe cause had gradually gained in strength, however, and a factor\r\nwhich had strong influence was the splendid cooperation of many other\r\norganizations. The president of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union\r\noften spoke at the suffrage conventions and legislative hearings and\r\nthe superintendent of franchise, Dr. Lavinia R. Davis, sent out\r\nthousands of suffrage leaflets and appeals to the women of the local\r\nunions every year. The State Grange, with its membership approaching\r\n100,000, passed favorable resolutions many times and gave the\r\npresident and vice-president of the suffrage association, who were\r\nmembers, opportunities to speak at its meetings. The State Federation\r\nof Labor granted the vice-president time for an address at its\r\nconvention in Troy as early as 1908 and thereafter endorsed the\r\nsuffrage bills and sent speakers to the hearings on them. Women from\r\nlabor unions spoke at conventions of the State Suffrage Association,\r\nwhich had a Committee on Industrial Work. The Western New York\r\nFederation of Women's Clubs, under the leadership of Mrs. Nettie\r\nRogers Shuler of Buffalo, its president, was the first federation to\r\nadmit suffrage clubs and a suffrage resolution was passed at its\r\nconvention in 1909, at which time it had 35,000 members.\r\n\r\nThe annual conventions of the State association always were held in\r\nOctober. The thirty-third in the long series met at Oswego in the\r\nPresbyterian Church in 1901 and was welcomed by Mayor A. M. Hall.\r\nAddresses were made by Miss Susan B. Anthony, honorary president of\r\nthe National American Woman Suffrage Association; Dr. Anna Howard\r\nShaw, its vice-president-at-large; Alice Stone Blackwell, its\r\nrecording secretary; Harriet May Mills and Julie R. Jenney of\r\nSyracuse. A memorial service was held for one of the pioneers,\r\nCharlotte A. Cleveland of Wyoming county, Mrs. Jean Brooks Greenleaf,\r\nformer State president, and Mrs. Ella Hawley Crossett, vice-president,\r\noffering testimonials of her ability and helpfulness. She left the\r\nassociation a legacy of $2,000, the first it ever had received. Mrs.\r\nMariana W. Chapman, president since 1896, was re-elected.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1902 was held in Buffalo at the Church of the\r\nMessiah. The wife of the Mayor, Erastus Knight, represented him in\r\ngiving a welcome from the city. Owing to the illness of Mrs. Chapman,\r\nMrs. Crossett presided. She was elected president, after having served\r\nfour years as vice-president. Miss Mills was chosen for that office\r\nand they served for the next eight years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SUSAN B. ANTHONY MEMORIAL BUILDING\r\n\r\nAt Rochester (N. Y.) University.]\r\n\r\nIn 1903 the convention was held in the Presbyterial Church at\r\nHornellsville welcomed by Mayor C. F. Nelson and the Rev. Charles\r\nPetty, pastor of the church. Mrs. Crossett responded and gave her\r\nannual address, which showed much activity during the year. Miss\r\nMills, chairman of the State organization committee, said that she had\r\narranged for fifty-five meetings. Dr. Shaw had spoken in thirty\r\ndifferent counties, the president or vice-president accompanying her\r\nand organizing clubs at many places. The chairmen of the standing\r\ncommittees--Organization, Press, Legislative, Industries, Work Among\r\nChildren, Enrollment, School Suffrage--and also the county presidents\r\nreported effective work. The addresses of Miss Anthony, Dr. Shaw and\r\nMrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, national president, were highly appreciated\r\nby large audiences. During the summer of 1903, as in many others, Miss\r\nAnthony and Dr. Shaw attracted large gatherings at the Chautauqua and\r\nLily Dale Assemblies.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1904 met at Auburn. Mrs. Eliza Wright Osborne,\r\ndaughter of Martha Wright and niece of Lucretia Mott, two of those who\r\nhad called the first Woman's Rights Convention, entertained the\r\nofficers and many chairmen in the annex of the hotel, a stenographer,\r\ntypewriter and every convenience being placed at their disposal. In\r\nher own home she had as guests Miss Anthony, Dr. Shaw, Mrs. William\r\nLloyd Garrison (her sister), Emily Howland, Mrs. William C. Gannett,\r\nLucy E. Anthony and others. One evening her spacious house was thrown\r\nopen for the people of the city to meet the noted suffragists. The\r\nconvention was held in Music Hall, a gift of Mrs. Osborne to the city,\r\nand her son, Thomas Mott Osborne, welcomed it as Mayor.\r\n\r\nThe old Political Equality Club of Rochester, of which Miss Mary S.\r\nAnthony was president for many years, invited the convention for 1905.\r\nTo go to the home city of the Anthony sisters was indeed a pleasure.\r\nThey opened their house one afternoon for all who desired to take a\r\ncup of tea with them. It was crowded and many expressed themselves as\r\nfeeling that they were on a sacred spot. A large number went to the\r\nthird story to see the rooms where Mrs. Ida Husted Harper spent\r\nseveral years with Miss Anthony writing her biography and Volume IV of\r\nthe History of Woman Suffrage. A reception was given at Powers Hotel\r\nattended by over 600 people. During the meetings Miss Anthony\r\nintroduced a number of women who had attended the first Woman's Rights\r\nConvention, which adjourned from Seneca Falls to Rochester, Mary\r\nHallowell, Sarah Willis, Mary S. Anthony and Maria Wilder Depuy.\r\n\r\nThe convention was held in the Universalist Church. Mayor James G.\r\nCutler, who welcomed the delegates, spoke very highly of his \"esteemed\r\nfellow citizen, Susan B. Anthony\" and presented her with a large\r\nbouquet of American Beauty roses. Mrs. Crossett in her annual address\r\ncompared the convention held at Rochester in 1890, when there were but\r\nseven local clubs in the State, with this one representing 100 local\r\nand 31 county clubs. Elnora M. Babcock, press chairman, reported 500\r\npapers in the State using articles favorable to woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe convention for 1906 met at Syracuse in the (Samuel J.) May\r\nMemorial Church. Miss Anthony had passed away the preceding March.\r\nOver the entrance door of the church was a large banner with the last\r\nwords of the beloved leader, \"Failure is Impossible.\" The afternoon\r\nmeeting closed with tributes of reverence and appreciation by Mrs.\r\nOsborne, Anne Fitzhugh Miller, Marie Jenney Howe, Mrs. Crossett, Miss\r\nMills and Dr. Shaw. Large audiences gathered for the evening meetings,\r\namong the speakers being Mrs. Florence Kelley, Mrs. Henry Villard and\r\nMrs. Rachel Foster Avery. Dr. Shaw and Mrs. Avery spoke in the\r\nUniversity Chapel to the students.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1907, which met in Geneva, received a warm welcome;\r\nstores displayed the suffrage colors in their windows and many\r\ncitizens hung flags over their doorways. The gracious presence of Mrs.\r\nElizabeth Smith Miller and her daughter Anne, president of the Geneva\r\nPolitical Equality Club, the largest in the State, made the convention\r\nespecially memorable. The delegates were invited to Lochland, the\r\nMiller home on the lake, one afternoon where a memorial service was\r\nheld on the big porch, the place of many suffrage meetings, in memory\r\nof Mary S. Anthony, who had died the preceding February. Affectionate\r\ntributes were paid.[123] The convention was welcomed by Mayor Arthur\r\nP. Rose, City Attorney W. Smith O'Brien, Miss Miller and Mrs.\r\nCharlotte A. Baldridge, county president. Speakers were President\r\nLangdon C. Stewardson of Hobart College and Professors F. P. Nash and\r\nNathaniel Schmidt of Cornell University.\r\n\r\nThe 40th State convention was held in 1908 in Buffalo, whose suffrage\r\nclub invited the National American Association to hold its convention\r\nthere the same week, to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the first\r\nWoman's Rights Convention. For eight years Mrs. Richard Williams,\r\npresident of the club, had carried on the work in this city and had\r\nbuilt up an excellent organization. Mrs. George Howard Lewis and Mrs.\r\nDexter P. Rumsey were valuable members. Mrs. Lewis gave $10,000 to Dr.\r\nShaw for suffrage work. The State convention, which met two days\r\nbefore the National, voted to have headquarters at Albany during the\r\nlegislative session. It also voted to continue the State headquarters\r\nin Syracuse. Dr. Shaw had presented the suffrage question at the State\r\nFederation of Women's Clubs; Miss Mills had addressed the World's\r\nTemperance Congress; members had spoken before the resolution\r\ncommittees of the political State conventions and before many\r\ndifferent organizations, institutions, etc. On May 26, 27, Mrs.\r\nStanton Blatch had arranged a meeting in Seneca Falls to commemorate\r\nthe 60th Anniversary of the first Women's Rights Convention, called by\r\nElizabeth Cady Stanton and that noble band of women in 1848. Addresses\r\nwere made by their descendants and a number of the pioneer suffragists\r\nand a bronze tablet was placed on the Wesleyan Methodist Church, where\r\nthe convention was held.\r\n\r\nThis year Mrs. Clarence Mackay became interested in the work for woman\r\nsuffrage and organized in New York an Equal Franchise League of which\r\nshe was president, with headquarters in the Metropolitan Tower. She\r\nopened her house for lectures, interested a great many prominent and\r\ninfluential people and also arranged a course of public lectures in\r\none of the theaters, which attracted large audiences. The papers gave\r\ncolumns of space to her efforts and the movement received a great\r\nimpetus.\r\n\r\nIt had always been Miss Anthony's strong desire to have headquarters\r\nin this large center from which news of all kinds was sent to the four\r\nquarters of the globe. She realized the vast numbers of people who\r\ncould be reached and the great prestige which would be given to the\r\nmovement but even with her wonderful ability for getting money she\r\nnever could secure anywhere near enough to carry out this plan in the\r\ncity where everything must be done on a large scale to be successful.\r\nThe longed-for opportunity did not come in her lifetime but in 1909\r\nMrs. Oliver H. P. Belmont decided to take an active part in the work\r\nfor woman suffrage and inquired of the leaders what was the most\r\nimportant thing to be done. They answered quickly: \"Establish State\r\nheadquarters in New York City and also bring the National headquarters\r\nhere.\" With the executive ability for which she was noted Mrs. Belmont\r\nat once rented the entire floor of a big new office building at 505\r\nFifth Avenue, corner of 42nd Street, and invited both associations to\r\ntake headquarters there for two years. They did so and the movement\r\nreceived a strong impulse not only in New York but in the country at\r\nlarge. The State association paid no rent and the national press\r\nbureau was maintained by Mrs. Belmont.\r\n\r\nWhile in New York City women of the highest character and ability had\r\nsponsored the suffrage work it had not attracted the women who could\r\ngive it financial support. When Mrs. Mackay and Mrs. Belmont\r\nidentified themselves with it, opened their homes for lectures and\r\ninterested their friends public attention was aroused. The meetings\r\ngiven in August by Mrs. Belmont at Marble House, Newport, which never\r\nbefore had been opened to the public, received an immense amount of\r\nspace in the New York papers and those outside. The big headquarters\r\nsoon were thronged with women; magazines, syndicates and the daily\r\npress had articles and pictures; mass meetings and parades followed\r\nand thousands of women entered the suffrage ranks. At the end of two\r\nyears the State association was sufficiently well financed to maintain\r\nits headquarters, which remained in New York until its work was\r\nfinished. Mrs. Belmont never lost her interest in the cause and\r\ncontinued to make large contributions. In a few years Mrs. Mackay\r\nturned her attention to other matters but her society was continued\r\nunder the presidency of Mrs. Howard Mansfield. In 1909, under the\r\ndirection of Mrs. Catt, its chairman, the Inter-Urban Council of\r\ntwenty societies became the Woman Suffrage Party and organization\r\nalong the lines of the political parties was begun.\r\n\r\nThe delegates came to the State convention at Troy in 1909 with high\r\nhopes that with headquarters established in New York City the suffrage\r\nwork could be promoted as never before. It was held in the Y. M. C. A.\r\nbuilding and greeted by representatives of the Emma Willard\r\nAssociation, City Federation of Women's Clubs, Daughters of the\r\nAmerican Revolution and Teachers' Association. Mayor E. P. Mann\r\nextended an official welcome. Among the speakers was Professor Frances\r\nSquire Potter, national corresponding secretary. Mrs. William M. Ivins\r\ngave her impression of the suffrage movement in England and Miss\r\nCarolyn Crossett spoke on the meeting of the International Woman\r\nSuffrage Alliance in London, which she attended with Dr. Shaw. Not\r\nsince the constitutional convention in 1894 had so much work been\r\nreported. The State president or vice-president had attended meetings\r\nin 41 counties. All-day meetings were held in all the cities on the\r\nHudson River with excellent speakers, including Dr. Shaw. The\r\npresident, vice-president and corresponding secretary, Miss Alice\r\nWilliams, remained at Albany for three months, speaking and working in\r\nthe towns in the eastern part of the State. Three large\r\nSelf-Supporting Women's Suffrage Leagues joined the association.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 both the State association and the Woman Suffrage Party wrote\r\nChairman Timothy Woodruff of the Republican and Chairman John A. Dix\r\nof the Democratic State Committees requesting a hearing at the\r\nconventions. They were politely referred to the Resolutions\r\nCommittees. They went to the Republican convention at Saratoga\r\nSprings, carrying their literature and the printed resolution which\r\nthey wished the committee to put in the platform: \"We believe that the\r\nquestion of woman suffrage has reached such a degree of importance\r\nthat the Legislature should submit an amendment for it to the voters\r\nof the State.\" The committee allowed ten minutes; Mrs. Crossett\r\npresided and presented Mrs. Mary Wood, national organizer of the\r\nRepublican women; Miss Mary Garrett Hay, a leader of the New York\r\nWoman Suffrage Party and other able speakers but no attention was paid\r\nto their request. This program was repeated at the Democratic\r\nconvention in Rochester with the same result, and this had been the\r\nexperience for years. At this time candidates all over the State were\r\nbeing interviewed and women went to many county and city political\r\nconventions asking for endorsement of equal suffrage, seldom with\r\nsuccess, although the politicians admitted that the time for acting\r\nwas not far off.\r\n\r\nThe convention met at Niagara Falls in October, 1910, in the\r\nauditorium of the Shredded Wheat Biscuit Company, and was welcomed by\r\nMayor Peter Porter. Mrs. Crossett responded and gave her annual\r\naddress, which, she said, would be her last as president. Her home was\r\nin Warsaw in the western part of the State and when headquarters in\r\nNew York City were given to the association she promised to make that\r\nher home for one year but could not do so longer. Over 1,000 persons\r\nhad registered at the headquarters, she said, but these probably were\r\nnot over one-third of those who called. Most of them came for speakers\r\nor help in some way; others came to volunteer assistance. Meetings had\r\nbeen held in nearly every unorganized county and there were 37 county\r\nsocieties. There were 155 clubs in the association, which had begun to\r\nmake the assembly district the unit in the State, as Mrs. Catt had\r\ndone in New York City. These clubs had held 695 public and 1,614 local\r\nmeetings. The State board had arranged for 241 public meetings making\r\n2,550. The association had now a membership of 58,000.\r\n\r\nMrs. Belmont, who had rooms on the same floor with the State and\r\nnational associations, had formed eight clubs and given some of them\r\nheadquarters. The city had headquarters and altogether there were ten.\r\nA Men's League had been organized. A Cooperative Service Club of over\r\n100 business women was formed and met evenings at the State\r\nheadquarters. The association sponsored the work of securing names to\r\nthe National petition to Congress and they were tabulated at\r\nheadquarters. Greater New York women secured 24,114 names and there\r\nwere 72,086 signers in the State. A lecture bureau was established;\r\nMiss Carolyn Crossett went over the State arranging meetings; Miss\r\nMills spoke in 28 counties. Dr. B. O. Aylesworth of Colorado\r\nUniversity was spending the summer in New York and gave over twenty\r\nlectures for the association before clubs and public meetings. It\r\nseemed as if every woman's club in New York City asked for speakers\r\nand many of note were supplied. The association had published\r\nthousands of pieces of literature and used thousands prepared by the\r\nNational.\r\n\r\nIt was in this flourishing condition that the State association passed\r\nfrom the hands of Mrs. Crossett into those of her successor, Miss\r\nHarriet May Mills, who had served with her as vice-president\r\nthroughout the preceding eight years. The other officers during this\r\nperiod were Mrs. Shuler, Mary T. Sanford, Ada M. Hall, Ida A. Craft,\r\nIsabel Howland, Alice Williams, Anna E. Merritt, Georgiana Potter,\r\nNicolas Shaw Fraser, Mrs. Ivins, Eliza Wright Osborne, Mariana W.\r\nChapman and Mrs. Villard. The lack of space prevents naming the\r\nhundreds of women who gave unceasing service through these years when\r\nfaith and courage were required and there were no victories as a\r\nreward. In all the cities of the State the local women arranged\r\ncourses of lectures with prominent speakers and kept suffrage\r\ncontinually before the people through the press and in other ways. By\r\nthis quiet, persistent work of comparatively few women the foundation\r\nwas laid for the majorities in the many \"up-State\" counties when the\r\namendment came to a vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n1910-1913.[124]\r\n\r\nAt the annual convention of the State Association held in Niagara\r\nFalls, Oct. 18-21, 1910, the following officers were chosen:\r\nPresident, Miss Mills; vice-president, Mrs. Arthur L. Livermore,\r\nYonkers; corresponding secretary, Mrs. Roxana B. Burrows, Andover;\r\nrecording secretary, Mrs. Nicolas Shaw Fraser, Geneseo; treasurer,\r\nMrs. Ivins, New York; auditors, Mrs. Osborne, Auburn, Mrs. Villard,\r\nNew York. During the three following years there were but few\r\nchanges.[125]\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1911 met in Ithaca; that of 1912 in Utica and that\r\nof 1913 in Binghamton. This period was one of great activity, leading\r\nto the submission of an amendment to the State constitution by the\r\nLegislature in January, 1913, the object of the association for over\r\nforty years. Its paying membership had steadily increased from 5,252\r\nin October, 1910 to 8,139 in October, 1913, with over 50,000 enrolled\r\nmembers in addition. New York was thus enabled to continue its record\r\nof having the largest delegation each year in the national convention.\r\nThe receipts from membership were respectively $8,182, $11,836 and\r\n$14,230, the gains in membership and money amounting to about 60 per\r\ncent. The enrolled membership was finally adopted in place of the paid\r\nindividual membership through suffrage clubs. For fourteen years the\r\nassociation maintained the _News Letter_, edited for ten years by Miss\r\nMills and afterwards by Mrs. Minnie Reynolds and Miss Cora E. Morlan\r\nsuccessively.\r\n\r\nOne part of the work which helped build up the association was the\r\ngreat campaigns through the summers of 1911-12, covering the eastern,\r\nnorthern and western counties and Long Island. Over 200 of these\r\nopen-air rallies were held and thousands of enrolled members as well\r\nas new clubs and workers were secured. At the large Delhi meeting,\r\nheld as an exception in the opera house, Mrs. Henry White Cannon came\r\ninto the ranks, formed a strong organization and continued to be one\r\nof the valued leaders. Mrs. Gertrude Nelson Andrews for two years\r\nconducted classes in public speaking and knowledge of suffrage\r\nprinciples at the New York headquarters. She also went out into the\r\nState, rousing the women to the need of training themselves and others\r\nto speak for the cause and prepared a valuable book for her students.\r\n\r\nIn 1911 the State headquarters were moved into a beautiful old mansion\r\nat 180 Madison Avenue, just south of 34th Street in the heart of the\r\nshopping district, where they remained during 1912-13. Through the\r\ngenerosity of Mrs. Frances Lang, of whom they were leased, a\r\ncomparatively low rent was paid. The new quarters were opened with a\r\nbrilliant house-warming and in February a big State bazar and fair\r\nwere held to raise funds. The preceding year the association\r\ncelebrated Miss Anthony's birthday with a bazar in the roof garden of\r\nthe Hotel Astor, with articles contributed from all parts of the State\r\nand several thousand dollars were realized. Never was this anniversary\r\non February 15 allowed to pass without a special observance. In 1913\r\nit was celebrated by a reception at the Hotel Astor with speeches by\r\nMrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, Mrs. Ida Husted\r\nHarper, Miss Anthony's biographer, and others. A bust of the great\r\nleader was unveiled by the sculptor, Mrs. Adelaide Johnson.\r\nContributions of $2,500 were made.\r\n\r\nIn May the State association united with all the suffrage societies of\r\nNew York (except the Women's Political Union, Mrs. Harriot Stanton\r\nBlatch, president, which did not wish to take part), in a meeting and\r\npageant at the Metropolitan Opera House arranged by Mrs. Mansfield.\r\nFormer President Theodore Roosevelt and Dr. Shaw made notable\r\naddresses to an enthusiastic audience which crowded the vast\r\namphitheater and the great prima donna, Madame Nordica, a strong\r\nadvocate of woman suffrage, sang magnificently. The pageant was\r\nbeautiful and was accompanied by an orchestra composed entirely of\r\nwomen led by David Mannes. The association cooperated in a number of\r\nbig parades during these years, representatives coming from societies\r\nthroughout the State and from neighboring States. On the last Saturday\r\nin May, 1910, there was a night procession down Fifth Avenue with Mrs.\r\nJames Lees Laidlaw as the efficient chairman of arrangements. One on\r\nthe first Saturday in May, 1911, will ever be remembered, all the\r\nthousands of women dressed in white, headed by Mrs. C. O. Mailloux and\r\nMiss Carolyn Fleming carrying the flag of the State association, white\r\nsatin with a heavy gold fringe and a golden wreath of laurel in the\r\ncenter with the name and date of organization. The fund for it was\r\ncollected by Mrs. Ivins, the State treasurer, who gave so generously\r\nof her money, time, thought and effort to strengthen the association\r\nthrough the years of her service. At the head of the great parade the\r\nfirst Saturday in May, 1912, marched the handsome and stately Mrs.\r\nHerbert Carpenter, carrying the Stars and Stripes. Miss Portia Willis\r\nas grand marshal, robed in white and mounted on a white horse, made a\r\npicture never to be forgotten. These two led several processions. The\r\npioneers rode in handsomely decorated carriages. In these processions\r\ntens of thousands of women were in line and they marched with many\r\nbands from Washington Square to Central Park, a distance of several\r\nmiles. Delegates from Men's Suffrage Leagues walked with them. Half a\r\nmillion people lined the streets, orderly and respectful.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 representatives of the association attended the State\r\nconventions of all the parties and extended hearings were granted by\r\nthe Resolutions Committees. Their treatment was in great contrast to\r\nthat of earlier days when they could scarcely obtain five or ten\r\nminutes before a committee. This year every party declared for woman\r\nsuffrage in its platform. It was a gratification to sit in the great\r\nconvention hall at Saratoga and hear the Hon. Horace White of\r\nSyracuse, who throughout his long years in the State Senate had\r\nconstantly opposed the amendment, report in his capacity as chairman\r\nof the Resolutions Committee that the Republican party favored a\r\nspeedy referendum on woman suffrage. Many dramatic features of\r\npropaganda characterized these years, which marked the awakening of\r\nthe women of the entire State and brought into the ranks many\r\nwide-awake, independent young women, who wanted to use aggressive and\r\nspectacular methods, and these the older workers did not discourage.\r\nThose that attracted the most attention were the suffrage \"hikes,\" in\r\nwhich Miss Rosalie Jones, a girl of wealth and position, was the\r\nleading spirit. She sent a picturesque account of these \"hikes,\" which\r\nhas had to be condensed for lack of space.\r\n\r\n     The idea originated with Rosalie Gardiner Jones, who began by\r\n     making a tour of Long Island, her summer home, in a little cart\r\n     drawn by one horse and decorated with suffrage flags and banners,\r\n     stopping at every village and town, giving out literature and\r\n     talking to the crowds that gathered. \"If you once win the hearts\r\n     of the rural people you have them forever. That is why I decided\r\n     to organize a pilgrimage from New York City to Albany before the\r\n     opening of the legislative session, when it was hoped a woman\r\n     suffrage amendment would be submitted to the voters,\" she said.\r\n\r\n     Miss Jones recruited a small army of brave and devoted members,\r\n     of which she was the \"General\" and Miss Ida Craft of Brooklyn the\r\n     \"Colonel\" and the three others who walked every step to the end\r\n     of the journey were Miss Lavinia Dock--\"little Doc Dock\"--a\r\n     trained nurse, department editor of the _American Journal of\r\n     Nursing_ and author of The History of Nursing; Miss Sybil Wilbur\r\n     of Boston, biographer of Mary Baker Eddy, and Miss Katharine\r\n     Stiles of Brooklyn. They carried a message to Governor William\r\n     Sulzer expressing the earnest hope that his administration might\r\n     be distinguished by the speedy passage of the woman suffrage\r\n     amendment, signed by the presidents of the various New York\r\n     suffrage organizations, engraved on parchment and hand illumined\r\n     by Miss Jones. The \"hike\" began Monday morning, Dec. 16, 1912,\r\n     from the 242nd street subway station, where about 500 had\r\n     gathered, and about 200, including the newspaper correspondents,\r\n     started to walk.\r\n\r\n     From New York City to Albany there was left a trail of propaganda\r\n     among the many thousands of people who stopped at the cross roads\r\n     and villages to listen to the first word which had ever reached\r\n     them concerning woman suffrage, and many joined in and marched\r\n     for a few miles. The newspapers far and wide were filled with\r\n     pictures and stories. The march continued for thirteen days,\r\n     through sun and rain and snow over a distance of 170 miles,\r\n     including detours for special propaganda, and five pilgrims\r\n     walked into Albany at 4 p. m., December 28. Whistles blew, bells\r\n     rang, motor cars clanged their gongs, traffic paused, windows\r\n     were thrown up, stores and shops were deserted while Albany gazed\r\n     upon them, and large numbers escorted them to the steps of the\r\n     Capitol where they lifted their cry \"Votes for Women.\" They were\r\n     received at the Executive Mansion on the 31st and \"General\r\n     Rosalie\" gave the message in behalf of the suffragists of New\r\n     York State. The newly-elected Governor answered: \"All my life I\r\n     have believed in the right of women to exercise the franchise\r\n     with men as a matter of justice. I will do what I can to advance\r\n     their political rights and have already incorporated in my\r\n     Message advice to the legislators to pass the suffrage measure.\"\r\n\r\n     The \"hike\" had resulted in such tremendous advertising of woman\r\n     suffrage that another on a larger scale to Washington was\r\n     planned. \"General\" Jones and \"Colonel\" Craft were reinforced by\r\n     \"little Corporal\" Martha Klatschken of New York and a large\r\n     group, who were joined by others along the route. The \"army\" was\r\n     mustered in at the Hudson Terminal, New York, at 9 a. m. on\r\n     Lincoln's birthday, Feb. 12, 1913, and the start was made a\r\n     little later at Newark, N. J. Each marcher wore a picturesque\r\n     long brown woolen cape. The little yellow wagon with the good\r\n     horse \"Meg,\" driven by Miss Elizabeth Freeman, was joined at\r\n     Philadelphia by Miss Marguerite Geist, with a little cart and\r\n     donkey, and she helped distribute the suffrage buttons, flags and\r\n     leaflets.\r\n\r\n     Thousands of people were gathered at Newark to see the start of\r\n     this \"army of the Hudson,\" which now was known as the \"army of\r\n     the Potomac,\" and hundreds marched with them the first day. After\r\n     this about a hundred fell in at each town and marched to the next\r\n     one. Alphonse Major and Edward Van Wyck were the advance agents\r\n     who arranged for the meetings and the stopping places for the\r\n     night. They were constantly attended by the press correspondents,\r\n     at one time forty-five of them with their cameras, besides the\r\n     magazine writers. The Mayors of the places along the route would\r\n     send delegations to meet them and escort them to the town hall,\r\n     where the speech-making would begin. At Wilmington, Del., the\r\n     city council declared a half-holiday; the Mayor and officials met\r\n     them at the edge of town and escorted them to the town hall,\r\n     which was crowded, and they were obliged also to hold street\r\n     meetings for hours. They reached Philadelphia at 7 o'clock Sunday\r\n     evening, where the streets had been packed for hours awaiting\r\n     them, and it was only by holding street corner meetings on the\r\n     way that they could get to the hotel.\r\n\r\n     The Princeton University students had been roaming around all the\r\n     afternoon waiting for them, as there were a number of young\r\n     college boys and girls with them, and the speakers held the crowd\r\n     of boys for several hours. The next day a delegation of students\r\n     walked with them for miles. At all of the other university towns\r\n     they were received with the same enthusiasm. At the University of\r\n     Pennsylvania they were detained hours for speeches in the\r\n     grounds. At Baltimore they were received by Cardinal Gibbons in\r\n     his mansion, an extraordinary courtesy, as they were not\r\n     Catholics.\r\n\r\n     The \"hikers\" reached Hyattsville, four miles from Washington, the\r\n     evening of February 27 and spent the night there. The next\r\n     morning, escorted by a delegation of suffragists from the city,\r\n     they marched down Pennsylvania Avenue. The streets had been\r\n     thronged for several hours with a cosmopolitan crowd, from the\r\n     highest to the lowest. At the headquarters of the Congressional\r\n     Committee of the National American Suffrage Association, across\r\n     from the Treasury building, \"General\" Jones was presented with\r\n     flowers and disbanded her army. Fourteen had walked the entire\r\n     distance from New York--295 miles with some detours--and two had\r\n     walked from Philadelphia.[126]\r\n\r\n     A message to President Taft, similar to the one which had been\r\n     sent by the New York officers to Governor Sulzer, had been\r\n     entrusted by the board of the National Suffrage Association to\r\n     the pilgrims, who expected to march in a body to the White House\r\n     to deliver it. Before they reached Washington they were notified\r\n     that the board itself would present it to the incoming President\r\n     Wilson at a later date. Miss Florence Allen, the well known Ohio\r\n     lawyer, who had been marching for several days, returned to New\r\n     York, to try to obtain the recall of this decision but was\r\n     unsuccessful. Afterwards the board informed \"General\" Jones that\r\n     they would go together to the White House but all had separated,\r\n     the psychological moment had passed and the message was never\r\n     presented.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. The legislature of New York meets annually and\r\nfrom 1854 to 1917 a woman suffrage measure was presented only to be\r\nrejected, with two exceptions. The first was in 1880, when the\r\nLegislature undertook to give women the right to vote at school\r\nmeetings, but the law was ineffective and this great privilege was\r\nconfined to women in villages and country districts. The charters of\r\na number of third class cities granted School suffrage to women and\r\nsome of them included the right to vote on special appropriations for\r\nthose who paid taxes. This was the situation at the beginning of the\r\ncentury.[127]\r\n\r\n1901. When Theodore Roosevelt was Governor he advised the suffragists\r\nto drop the effort for a constitutional amendment awhile and work for\r\nsomething the Legislature could grant without a referendum to the\r\nvoters. For five years, therefore, they tried to get some form of\r\npartial suffrage that could be obtained without amending the\r\nconstitution. The total result was a law in 1901 giving to taxpaying\r\nwomen in the towns and villages a vote on propositions to raise money\r\nby special tax assessment, which was signed by Governor Benjamin F.\r\nOdell. Miss Susan B. Anthony considered this of little value but it\r\ncovered about 1,800 places and when she saw the interest aroused in\r\nthe women by even this small concession she came to think that it was\r\nworth while. In 1910 a legislative enactment increased this privilege\r\nto a vote on the issuing of bonds.\r\n\r\nDuring the legislative sessions of 1902-3-4-5 the effort was\r\nconcentrated on a bill to give a vote on special taxation to taxpaying\r\nwomen in all third class cities--those having less than 50,000\r\ninhabitants. Mrs. Mary H. Loines of Brooklyn was chairman of the\r\ncommittee, as she had been since 1898. The special champions of the\r\nbill were Senators Leslie B. Humphrey, H. S. Ambler, John Raines;\r\nRepresentatives Otto Kelsey, George H. Smith, Louis C. Bedell, E. W.\r\nHam. Among the strongest opponents were Senators Edgar Truman\r\nBrackett, George A. Davis, Thomas F. Grady and Nevada M. Stranahan.\r\nGovernors Odell and Frank M. Higgins recommended it and Speaker\r\nFrederick S. Nixon urged it. Committee hearings were granted at every\r\nsession and among its advocates were Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,\r\nnational president, Mrs. Crossett and Miss Harriet May Mills, State\r\npresident and vice-president; Mrs. Harriot Stanton Blatch, Mrs.\r\nMargaret Chanler Aldrich, Mrs. Mary E. Craigie and Miss Anne Fitzhugh\r\nMiller. Mrs. Arthur M. Dodge, president of the Anti-Suffrage\r\nAssociation, and Mrs. George Phillips, secretary, spoke in opposition.\r\nDuring these four years neither House voted on the bill and it was\r\nseldom reported by the committees.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 after consulting with Miss Anthony, the State leaders decided\r\nto return to the original effort for the submission to the voters of\r\nan amendment to the State constitution, which was presented by Senator\r\nHenry W. Hill of Buffalo and Representative E. C. Dowling of Brooklyn.\r\nMrs. Henry Villard, Mrs. John K. Howe and Mrs. Helen Z. M. Rodgers\r\nwere among the suffrage speakers and Mrs. Winslow W. Crannell was\r\nadded to the \"antis.\" No committee reports were made. The taxpayers'\r\nbill was also presented in 1906 and 1907 with no results of six years'\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThenceforth the resolution for the constitutional amendment was\r\nintroduced every year, in 1908 by Senator Percy Hooker of LeRoy. The\r\nclub women had now become interested and the legislators were deluged\r\nwith letters and literature. Miss Mary Garrett Hay, Miss Helen Varick\r\nBoswell and Mrs. Harry Hastings headed the large delegation from New\r\nYork City for the hearing. Mrs. Crossett informed the Judiciary\r\nCommittee that during the past year woman suffrage had been officially\r\nendorsed by the New York City Federation of Labor with 250,000\r\nmembers; State Grange with 75,000; New York City Federation of Women's\r\nClubs with 35,000; Woman's Christian Temperance Union with 30,000 and\r\nmany other organizations. F. A. Byrne spoke for the City Central Labor\r\nUnion. Mrs. Francis M. Scott represented the Anti-Suffrage\r\nAssociation. Morris Hilquit and Mrs. Meta Stern spoke independently\r\nfor the Socialists, making a strong appeal for the amendment. The\r\nSenate took no action and Speaker James W. Wadsworth, Jr., was able to\r\ndefeat any consideration by the Lower House. During the following\r\nsummer mass meetings were held in every city on the Hudson River\r\naddressed by Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, now president of the National\r\nSuffrage Association, and other noted speakers and a vast amount of\r\nwork was done in the State.\r\n\r\nIn the Legislature of 1909 Senator Hill and Representative Frederick\r\nR. Toombs introduced the resolution. At the hearing the Assembly\r\nChamber was filled to overflowing. Mrs. Villard, chairman of the\r\nLegislative Committee, presided.[128] People stood four hours\r\nlistening to the speeches and returned to a suffrage mass meeting at\r\nnight. Mrs. William Force Scott and Miss Margaret Doane Gardner spoke\r\nfor the \"antis.\" Mrs. Crossett asked of the committee: \"Does it mean\r\nnothing to you that 40,000 women in this State are organized to secure\r\nthe franchise; that a few years ago 600,000 people signed the petition\r\nfor woman suffrage to the constitutional convention; that associations\r\nformed for other purposes representing hundreds of thousands of\r\nmembers have endorsed it?\" Mrs. Graham, president of the State W. C.\r\nT. U.; Mrs. John Winters Brannan and Mrs. Pearce Bailey, representing\r\nthe Equal Franchise Society; Miss Mills, speaking for the State\r\nLeague; Leonora O'Reilly, presenting the resolution of the Women's\r\nTrade Union League of New York for the amendment; Mrs. Dexter F.\r\nRumsey, speaking for Mrs. Nettie Rogers Shuler, president of the\r\nWestern New York Federation of Women's Clubs; Mrs. Lillie Devereux\r\nBlake, a pioneer suffragist, president of the Legislative League; Mrs.\r\nFlorence Kelley, executive secretary of the Consumers' League; Mrs.\r\nGeorge Howard Lewis of Buffalo, a well known philanthropist; Mrs. Maud\r\nNathan, president of the New York Consumers' League; Mrs. Rodgers and\r\nMrs. Gabrielle Mulliner, lawyers--all urged the legislators to submit\r\nthe question to the voters. Dr. Shaw held the audience spellbound\r\nuntil 6 o'clock. John Spargo, the well known socialist, spoke\r\nindependently with much power, demanding the vote especially for\r\nworking women. The use of the Assembly Chamber was granted for an\r\nevening suffrage meeting which attracted a large audience. The\r\nLegislature took no action.[129]\r\n\r\nMembers of the large legislative committee met weekly during the\r\nsession of 1910 at the State headquarters in New York to assist in\r\npromoting the work. All the workers as usual contributed their\r\nservices. Mrs. Crossett and Miss Mills remained in Albany. A notable\r\nmeeting was held there at Harmanus-Bleecker Hall, with excellent\r\nspeakers. The boxes were filled with prominent women, who had invited\r\nmany of the State officials as guests; seats were sent to all the\r\nmembers of the Legislature, most of whom were present, and the house\r\nwith a capacity of 2,000 was crowded. Mrs. Clarence Mackay defrayed\r\nmost of the expenses. On January 22 Governor Charles E. Hughes granted\r\na hearing to George Foster Peabody, Oswald Garrison Villard, Mrs. Ella\r\nH. Boole, Mrs. Villard, Mrs. Crossett, Mrs. Frederick R. Hazard and\r\nMiss Anne F. Miller, who urged him to recommend the submission of an\r\namendment. He seemed much impressed by the statements made but they\r\nhad no effect. The hearing on March 9 broke all records. The Assembly\r\nChamber was filled to the utmost and surging crowds outside tried to\r\nget in. Members of both Houses stood for hours listening to the\r\nspeeches. Jesse R. Phillips, chairman of the Assembly Judiciary\r\nCommittee, presided. The suffrage speakers were headed by the eminent\r\nlawyer, Samuel Untermeyer. The anti-suffragists had a long list,\r\nincluding Mrs. Henry M. Stimson, wife of a New York Baptist minister,\r\nand Mrs. William P. Northrup of Buffalo. Both Judiciary Committees\r\nrefused to let the resolution come before the two Houses, admitting\r\nthat it would be carried if they did.\r\n\r\nThe most thorough preparation was made for the session of 1911 by all\r\nthe suffrage societies. The Assembly committee refused to report and\r\non May 10 Representative Spielberg, who had charge, moved to request\r\nit to do so. The vote was 38 in favor to 90 against his motion. On\r\nMay 15 the Senate Judiciary Committee by 6 to 2 reported in favor but\r\nnot until July 12 was the vote taken in the Senate and the measure was\r\nlost by a vote of 14 ayes, 17 noes.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 a remarkable hearing was held in a crowded Assembly Chamber.\r\nSenator Stillwell, a member of the Judiciary Committee, again\r\nintroduced the amendment resolution and its chairman, Senator Bayne,\r\nwas a staunch friend but after the committee had reported it favorably\r\nthe Senate could not be moved. In the Assembly, on the final day of\r\nthe session, for the first time since 1895 and the second time on\r\nrecord, the resolution was adopted. Just as it was about to be taken\r\nto the Senate for action, Representative Cuvellier of New York blocked\r\nfurther progress by moving to reconsider the vote and lay the\r\nresolution on the table. This was carried by a vote of 69 to 6 and\r\ndoubtless had been prearranged.\r\n\r\nBy 1913 the sentiment in favor of letting the voters pass on the\r\nquestion had become too strong to be resisted. Mrs. Katharine Gavit of\r\nAlbany, representing the Cooperative Legislative Committee, had charge\r\nof the resolution. On January 6, the opening day, a delegation from\r\nall the suffrage societies sat in the Senate Chamber and heard it\r\nintroduced by Senator Wagner, the Democratic floor leader, who said\r\nthat, while not personally in favor of it he was willing to sponsor it\r\nbecause his party had endorsed it in their platform, and it was\r\nfavorably reported. In the Assembly it was promptly introduced by A.\r\nJ. Levy, chairman of the Judiciary Committee. The form of the proposed\r\namendment had been changed from that of all preceding years, which had\r\nintended simply to take the word \"male\" from the suffrage clause of\r\nthe constitution. As alien women could secure citizenship through\r\nmarriage and would thus immediately become voters it provided that\r\nthey must first live in the country five years. The Senate struck out\r\nthis naturalization clause; in the Assembly the Democratic members\r\nwanted it, the Republicans objected to it. On January 20 the Assembly\r\npassed the measure without it. The Senate put back the clause and\r\npassed it January 23 by 40 ayes, two noes--McCue and Frawley of New\r\nYork--and returned it to the Assembly, which passed it four days later\r\nby 128 ayes, 5 noes. The resolution had still to pass another\r\nLegislature two years later but this was the beginning of the end for\r\nwhich two generations of women had worked and waited.\r\n\r\n[LAWS. A complete digest of the laws relating to women and children\r\nduring the first twenty years of the century was prepared for this\r\nchapter by Miss Kathryn H. Starbuck, attorney and counsellor at law in\r\nSaratoga Springs. It comprises about 3,600 words and includes laws\r\nrelating to property, marriage, guardianship, domestic relations, etc.\r\nMuch regret is felt that the exigencies of space compel the omission\r\nof the laws in all the State chapters. Miss Starbuck gave also\r\nvaluable information on office holding and occupations, which had to\r\nbe omitted for the same reason.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK CITY CAMPAIGNS.[130]\r\n\r\nThe story of the growth of the woman suffrage movement in Greater New\r\nYork is one of the most interesting chapters in the history of this\r\ncause, for while it advanced slowly for many years, it rose in 1915\r\nand 1917 to a height never attained elsewhere and culminated in two\r\ncampaigns that in number of adherents and comprehensive work were\r\nnever equaled.\r\n\r\nThe Brooklyn Woman Suffrage Association was formed May 13, 1869, and\r\nthe New York City Society in 1870. From this time various\r\norganizations came into permanent existence until in 1903 there were\r\nfifteen devoted to suffrage propaganda. In Manhattan (New York City)\r\nand Brooklyn these were bound together by county organizations but in\r\norder to unite all the suffragists in cooperative work the Interurban\r\nWoman Suffrage Council was formed in 1903 at the Brooklyn home of a\r\npioneer, Mrs. Priscilla D. Hackstaff, with the President of the Kings\r\nCounty Political Equality League, Mrs. Martha Williams, presiding. The\r\nInterurban began with a roster of five which gradually increased to\r\ntwenty affiliated societies, with an associate membership besides of\r\n150 women. Under the able leadership of Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,\r\nchairman, it established headquarters in the Martha Washington Hotel,\r\nNew York City, Feb. 15, 1907, with a secretary, Miss Fannie Chafin,\r\nin charge, and maintained committees on organization, literature,\r\nlegislative work, press and lectures; formed clubs, held mass meetings\r\nand systematically distributed literature. The Council was the first\r\nsuffrage organization in New York City to interview Assemblymen and\r\nSenators on woman suffrage and it called the first representative\r\nconvention held in the big metropolis.\r\n\r\nThe Woman Suffrage Party of Greater New York was launched by this\r\nCouncil at Carnegie Hall, October 29, 1909, modelled after that of the\r\ntwo dominant political parties. Its first convention with 804\r\ndelegates and 200 alternates constituted the largest delegate suffrage\r\nbody ever assembled in New York State. The new party announced that it\r\nwould have a leader for each of the 63 assembly districts of the city\r\nand a captain for each of the 2,127 election districts, these and\r\ntheir assistant officers to be supervised by a borough chairman and\r\nother officers in each borough, the entire force to be directed by a\r\ncity chairman assisted by city officers and a board of directors. Mrs.\r\nCatt, with whom the idea of the Party originated, and her co-workers\r\nbelieved that by reaching into every election district to influence\r\nits voters, they would bring suffrage close to the people and\r\neventually influence parties and legislators through public opinion.\r\n\r\nThe population of Greater New York was 4,700,000 and the new party had\r\na task of colossal proportions. It had to appeal to native Americans\r\nof all classes and conditions and to thousands of foreign born. It\r\nsent its forces to local political conventions; held mass meetings;\r\nissued thousands of leaflets in many languages; conducted street\r\nmeetings, parades, plays, lectures, suffrage schools; gave\r\nentertainments and teas; sent appeals to churches and all kinds of\r\norganizations and to individual leaders; brought pressure on\r\nlegislators through their constituents and obtained wide publicity in\r\nnewspapers and magazines. It succeeded in all its efforts and\r\nincreased its membership from 20,000 in 1910 to over 500,000 in 1917.\r\n\r\nIn 1915, at the beginning of the great campaign for a suffrage\r\namendment to the State constitution, which had been submitted by the\r\nLegislature, the State was divided into twelve campaign districts.\r\nGreater New York was made the first and under the leadership of Miss\r\nMary Garrett Hay, who since 1912 had served as chairman, the City\r\nWoman Suffrage Party plunged into strenuous work, holding conventions,\r\nsending out organizers, raising $50,000 as a campaign fund, setting a\r\nspecific task for each month of 1915 up to Election Day, and forming\r\nits own committees with chairmen as follows: Industrial, Miss Leonora\r\nO'Reilly; The Woman Voter, Mrs. Thomas B. Wells; Speakers' Bureau,\r\nMrs. Mabel Russell; Congressional, Mrs. Lillian Griffin; the French,\r\nMrs. Anna Ross Weeks; the German, Miss Catherine Dreier; the Press,\r\nMrs. Oreola Williams Haskell; Ways and Means, Mrs. John B. McCutcheon.\r\n\r\nThe City Party began the intensive work of the campaign in January,\r\n1915, when a swift pace was set for the succeeding months by having 60\r\ndistrict conventions, 170 canvassing suppers, four mass meetings, 27\r\ncanvassing conferences and a convention in Carnegie Hall. It was\r\ndecided to canvass all of the 661,164 registered voters and hundreds\r\nof women spent long hours toiling up and down tenement stairs, going\r\nfrom shop to shop, visiting innumerable factories, calling at hundreds\r\nof city and suburban homes, covering the rural districts, the big\r\ndepartment stores and the immense office buildings with their\r\nthousands of occupants. It was estimated that 60 per cent of the\r\nenrolled voters received these personal appeals. The membership of the\r\nparty was increased by 60,535 women secured as members by canvassers.\r\n\r\nThe following is a brief summing up of the activities of the ten\r\nmonths' campaign.[131]\r\n\r\n\r\n     Voters canvassed (60 per cent of those enrolled)         396,698\r\n     Women canvassed                                           60,535\r\n     Voters circularized                                      826,796\r\n     Party membership increased from 151,688 to               212,223\r\n     Watchers and pickets furnished for the polls               3,151\r\n     Numbers of leaflets printed and distributed            2,883,264\r\n     Money expended from the City treasury                    $25,579\r\n     Number of outdoor meetings                      5,225\r\n     Number of indoor meetings (district)              660\r\n     Number of mass meetings                            93\r\n     Political meetings addressed by Congressmen,\r\n       Assemblymen and Constitutional Convention\r\n       delegates                                        25\r\n\r\n     Total number of meetings                                   6,003\r\n\r\n     Night speaking in theaters                                    60\r\n     Theater Week (Miner's and Keith's)                             2\r\n     Speeches and suffrage slides in movie theaters               150\r\n     Concerts (indoor, 10, outdoor, 3)                             13\r\n     Suffrage booths in bazaars                                     6\r\n     Number of Headquarters (Borough 4, Districts, 20)             24\r\n     Campaign vans (drawn by horses 6, decorated autos 6,\r\n       district autos 4), vehicles in constant use                 16\r\n     Papers served regularly with news (English and foreign)       80\r\n     Suffrage editions of papers prepared                           2\r\n     Special articles on suffrage                                 150\r\n     Sermons preached by request just before election              64\r\n\r\n     A _Weekly News Bulletin_ (for papers and workers) and the _Woman\r\n     Voter_ (a weekly magazine) issued; many unique features like\r\n     stories, verses, etc.; hundreds of ministers circularized and\r\n     speakers sent to address congregations; the endorsements of all\r\n     city officials and of many prominent people and big organizations\r\n     secured.\r\n\r\nIn order to accomplish the work indicated by this table a large number\r\nof expert canvassers, speakers, executives and clerical workers were\r\nrequired. Mrs. Catt as State Campaign chairman was a great driving\r\nforce and an inspiration that never failed, and Miss Hay in directing\r\nthe party forces and raising the money showed remarkable ability.\r\nAssociated with her were capable officials--Mrs. Margaret Chandler\r\nAldrich, Mrs. Wells, Mrs. Martha Wentworth Suffren, Mrs. Robert\r\nMcGregor, Mrs. Cornelia K. Hood, Mrs. Marie Jenney Howe, Mrs. Joseph\r\nFitch, Mrs. A. J. Newbury, and the tireless borough chairmen, Mrs.\r\nJames Lees Laidlaw, Manhattan; Mrs. H. Edward Dreier, Brooklyn; Mrs.\r\nHenrietta Speke Seeley, Bronx; Mrs. Alfred J. Eno, Queens, and Mrs.\r\nWilliam G. Willcox, Richmond.\r\n\r\nThe spectacular activities of the campaign caught and held public\r\nattention. Various classes of men were complimented by giving them\r\n\"suffrage days.\" The appeal to the firemen took the form of an\r\nautomobile demonstration, open air speaking along the line of march of\r\ntheir annual parade and a ten dollar gold piece given to one of their\r\nnumber who made a daring rescue of a yellow-sashed dummy--a suffrage\r\nlady. A circular letter was sent to 800 firemen requesting their help\r\nfor all suffragists. \"Barbers' Day\" produced ten columns of copy in\r\nleading New York dailies. Letters were sent in advance to 400 barbers\r\ninforming them that on a certain day the suffragists would call upon\r\nthem. The visits were made in autos decorated with barbers' poles and\r\nladen with maps and posters to hang up in the shops and then open air\r\nmeetings were held out in front. Street cleaners on the day of the\r\n\"White Wings\" parade were given souvenirs of tiny brooms and suffrage\r\nleaflets and addressed from automobiles. A whole week was given to the\r\nstreet car men who numbered 240,000. Suffrage speeches were given at\r\nthe car barns and leaflets and a \"car barn\" poster distributed.\r\n\r\nForty-five banks and trust companies were treated to a \"raid\" made by\r\nsuffrage depositors, who gave out literature and held open meetings\r\nafterward. Brokers were reached through two days in Wall Street where\r\nthe suffragists entered in triumphal style, flags flying, bugles\r\nplaying. Speeches were made, souvenirs distributed and a luncheon held\r\nin a \"suffrage\" restaurant. The second day hundreds of colored\r\nballoons were sent up to typify \"the suffragists' hopes ascending.\"\r\nWorkers in the subway excavations were visited with Irish banners and\r\nshamrock fliers; Turkish, Armenian, French, German and Italian\r\nrestaurants were canvassed as were the laborers on the docks, in\r\nvessels and in public markets.\r\n\r\nA conspicuous occasion was the Night of the Interurban Council Fires,\r\nwhen on high bluffs in the different boroughs huge bonfires were\r\nlighted, fireworks and balloons sent up, while music, speeches and\r\ntransparencies emphasized the fact that woman's evolution from the\r\ncampfire of the savage into a new era was commemorated. Twenty-eight\r\nparades were a feature of the open air demonstrations. There were\r\nbesides numbers of torchlight rallies; street dances on the lower East\r\nSide; Irish, Syrian, Italian and Polish block parties; outdoor\r\nconcerts, among them a big one in Madison Square, where a full\r\norchestra played, opera singers sang and eminent orators spoke; open\r\nair religious services with the moral and religious aspects of\r\nsuffrage discussed; a fête held in beautiful Dyckman Glen; flying\r\nsquadrons of speakers whirling in autos from the Battery to the Bronx;\r\nan \"interstate meet\" on the streets where suffragists of\r\nMassachusetts, New Jersey and New York participated. Ninety original\r\nfeatures arranged on a big scale with many minor ones brought great\r\npublicity to the cause and the suffragists ended their campaign\r\nvaliantly with sixty speakers talking continuously in Columbus Circle\r\nfor twenty-six hours.\r\n\r\nOn the night of November 2, election day, officers, leaders, workers,\r\nmembers of the Party and many prominent men and women gathered at City\r\nheadquarters in East 34th Street to receive the returns, Mrs. Catt and\r\nMiss Hay at either end of a long table. At first optimism prevailed as\r\nthe early returns seemed to indicate victory but as adverse reports\r\ncame in by the hundreds all hopes were destroyed. The fighting spirits\r\nof the leaders then rose high. Speeches were made by Dr. Anna Howard\r\nShaw, Mrs. Catt, Miss Hay, Dr. Katherine Bement Davis, Mrs. Laidlaw\r\nand others, and, though many workers wept openly, the gathering took\r\non the character of an embattled host ready for the next conflict.\r\nAfter midnight many of the women joined a group from the State\r\nheadquarters and in a public square held an outdoor rally which they\r\ncalled the beginning of the new campaign.\r\n\r\nThe vote was as follows:\r\n\r\n                                 For       Against    Lost by\r\n  Manhattan Borough             88,886     117,610     28,724\r\n  Brooklyn Borough              87,402     121,679     34,277\r\n  Bronx Borough                 34,307      40,991      6,684\r\n  Richmond Borough               6,108       7,469      1,361\r\n  Queens Borough                21,395      33,104     11,709\r\n\r\n  Total opposed, 320,853; in favor, 238,098; adverse majority, 82,755.\r\n\r\nTwo days after the election the City Party united with the National\r\nAssociation in a mass meeting at Cooper Union, where speeches were\r\nmade and $100,000 pledged for a new campaign fund. The spirit of the\r\nmembers was shown in the words of a leader who wrote: \"We know that we\r\nhave gained over half a million voters in the State, that we have many\r\nnew workers, have learned valuable lessons and with the knowledge\r\nobtained and undiminished courage we are again in the field of\r\naction.\" In December and January the usual district and borough\r\nconventions for the election of officers and then the city convention\r\nwere held. At the latter the resolution adopted showed a change from\r\nthe oldtime pleading: \"We demand the re-submission of the woman\r\nsuffrage amendment in 1917. We insist that the Judiciary Committee\r\nshall present a favorable report without delay and that the bill shall\r\ncome to an early vote.\" Much legislative work was necessary to obtain\r\nre-submission, for which the City Party worked incessantly until the\r\namendment was re-submitted by the Legislatures of 1916 and 1917 and\r\npreparations were again made for a great campaign.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1915 had been one of the highways, and of spectacular\r\ndisplay. That of 1917 was of the byways, of quiet, intensive work\r\nreaching every group of citizens. The campaign was launched at a\r\nmeeting in Aeolian Hall, March 29, where the addresses of Mrs. Catt\r\nand Miss Hay aroused true campaign fervor, the former saying: \"Some\r\nforeign countries have given the franchise to women for their war\r\nwork; we ask it that our women may feel they have been recognized as\r\nassets of the nation before it calls on them for war work.\"\r\n\r\nThe suffragists offered their services to the Government, even before\r\nit declared war; the State Party to the Governor, the City Party to\r\nthe Mayor. The later said in a resolution adopted February 5: \"We\r\nplace at the disposal of the Mayor of this city for any service he may\r\nrequire our full organization of over 200,000 women, thoroughly\r\norganized and trained and with headquarters in every borough.\" The\r\nmass of the members stood solidly behind this offer. A War Service\r\nCommittee was appointed with Mrs. F. Louis Slade as its chairman and\r\nit accomplished work that was not exceeded, if indeed equalled, in any\r\ncity of the United States. Nine other committees were also appointed.\r\n\r\nThe leading features of the campaign of 1917 were the war work and the\r\nenrolling of women. In 1916 when Mrs. Catt started a canvass to obtain\r\na million signatures of women to a petition to answer the argument,\r\n\"Women do not want to vote,\" the City Party took as its share the\r\nsecuring of 514,555 in Greater New York. This accomplished, the\r\nsignatures mounted on big placards were placed on exhibition at Party\r\nheadquarters, now in East 38th Street, and a little ceremony was\r\narranged during which Mayor John Purroy Mitchel and other prominent\r\nmen made commendatory speeches. Debarred from outdoor meetings during\r\nthe summer of 1916 on account of an epidemic and during the summer of\r\n1917 because of war conditions, the following was nevertheless\r\naccomplished:\r\n\r\n\r\n     Meetings                                            2,085\r\n     Leaflets distributed                            5,196,884\r\n     Money expended                                   $151,438\r\n     Canvassed and enrolled women                      514,555\r\n     Women secured to watch at polls                     5,000\r\n     Campaign headquarters maintained                       40\r\n     Newspapers (English and foreign) served daily         153\r\n     Suffrage editions and pages edited                     10\r\n     Special suffrage articles                             200\r\n     Other suffrage articles and interviews                400\r\n     Posters placed in shop windows                      2,000\r\n\r\n     Maintained Letter Writing Committee to send letters to the press;\r\n     issued Weekly News Bulletin; printed suffrage news in papers in\r\n     ten languages; circularized all churches and business men in 75\r\n     per cent of the 2,060 election districts; conducted hundreds of\r\n     watchers' schools; exhibited suffrage movies in hundreds of\r\n     clubs, churches and settlements; had series of suppers and\r\n     conferences for working-women; held captains' rally at the\r\n     Waldorf-Astoria and a patriotic rally at Carnegie Hall; gave a\r\n     series of suffrage study courses; raised funds at sacrifice\r\n     sales, entertainments, lectures, etc.; sent speakers to hundreds\r\n     of Labor Union meetings; held four pre-election mass meetings and\r\n     as a wind-up to the campaign staged eight hours of continuous\r\n     speaking by 40 men and women at Columbus Circle.\r\n\r\nThe Party leaders had to meet attacks and misrepresentations from the\r\nAnti-Suffrage Association, whose national and State headquarters were\r\nin New York City. The Party had also to combat the actions of the\r\n\"militant\" suffragists, whose headquarters were in Washington and\r\nwhose picketing of the White House and attacks on President Wilson and\r\nother public men displeased many people who did not discriminate\r\nbetween the large constructive branch of the suffrage movement and the\r\nsmall radical branch. The Party leaders had often publicly to\r\nrepudiate the \"militant\" tactics. In the parade of Oct. 28, 1917, the\r\nParty exhibited placards which read: \"We are opposed to Picketing the\r\nWhite House. We stand by the Country and the President.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the campaign, Miss Hay had associated with her on the executive\r\nboard, Mrs. Slade, Mrs. Aldrich, Mrs. George Notman, Miss Annie\r\nDoughty, Mrs. F. Robertson-Jones, Mrs. Wells, Miss Adaline W.\r\nSterling, Mrs. Herbert Lee Pratt, Mrs. Charles E. Simonson, Dr.\r\nKatherine B. Davis, Miss Eliza McDonald, Mrs. Alice P. Hutchins, Mrs.\r\nLouis Welzmiller. Borough chairmen who assisted were Mrs. John\r\nHumphrey Watkins, Manhattan; Mrs. Dreier, Brooklyn; Mrs. Daniel\r\nAppleton Palmer, Bronx; Mrs. David B. Rodger, Queens; Mrs. Wilcox,\r\nRichmond.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of November 6, election day, the City Party\r\nheadquarters were crowded with people waiting for the returns. Mrs.\r\nCatt, Miss Hay, Mrs. Laidlaw and other leaders were present. Mr.\r\nLaidlaw and Judge Wadhams were \"keeping the count.\" Walter Damrosch\r\nand other prominent men came in. From the beginning the returns were\r\nencouraging and as the evening wore on and victory was assured, the\r\nroom rang with cheers and applause and there were many jubilant\r\nspeeches.\r\n\r\nThe election brought a great surprise, for the big city, whose adverse\r\nvote suffragists had always predicted would have to be outbalanced by\r\nupstate districts, won the victory, the latter not helping but\r\nactually pulling down its splendid majority. The final vote in Greater\r\nNew York read:\r\n\r\n                                              _Majority_\r\n                         _Yes_        _No_    _in Favor_\r\n  New York County       129,412      89,124      40,288\r\n  Kings (Brooklyn)      129,601      92,315      37,286\r\n  Bronx                  52,660      36,346      16,314\r\n  Richmond                7,868       5,224       2,644\r\n  Queens                 34,125      26,794       7,331\r\n                        -------     -------     -------\r\n    Total               353,666     249,803     103,863\r\n\r\n  Upstate districts, 349,463 ayes; 350,973 noes, lost by 1,510.\r\n  Majority in the State as a whole, 102,353.\r\n\r\nImmediately opponents made the charge that suffrage won in the City\r\nbecause of the pro-German, pacifist and Socialist vote. An analysis\r\nshowed that in many districts where the Germans and Socialists\r\npredominated there was not as great a suffrage majority as in\r\nRepublican or Democratic districts; that some of the conservative\r\nresidential sections were more favorable than radical districts and\r\nthat the soldiers in the field had voted for suffrage in the ratio of\r\ntwo to one.\r\n\r\nThose who were best informed attributed the victory to many causes--to\r\nthe support of voters in all the parties; to the help of the labor\r\nunions; to recognition of women's war work; to the example set by\r\nEuropean countries in enfranchising their women; to the endorsement of\r\nprominent men and strong organizations. Most of all, however, it was\r\ndue to the originality, the dauntless energy, the thorough\r\norganization methods and the ceaseless campaigning of the suffrage\r\nworkers, who in winning the great Empire State not only secured the\r\nvote for New York women but made the big commonwealth an important\r\nasset in the final struggle for the Federal Suffrage Amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWO STATE CAMPAIGNS.[132]\r\n\r\nAt the 45th convention of the State Woman Suffrage Association held in\r\nBinghamton Oct. 14-17, 1913, Miss Harriet May Mills declined to stand\r\nfor re-election to the presidency. The following officers were\r\nelected: President, Mrs. Raymond Brown, New York City; corresponding\r\nsecretary, Mrs. Henry W. Cannon, Delhi; recording secretary, Mrs.\r\nNicolas Shaw Fraser, Geneseo; treasurer, Mrs. Edward M. Childs, New\r\nYork City; directors; Miss Mills, Syracuse; Mrs. Arthur L. Livermore,\r\nYonkers; Mrs. Helen Probst Abbott, Rochester; Mrs. Dexter P. Rumsey,\r\nBuffalo; Mrs. George W. Topliff, Binghamton; Mrs. Luther Mott, Oswego;\r\nMrs. Chanler Aldrich, Tarrytown.\r\n\r\nThis convention had before it work of the gravest importance. The\r\nsubmission of a woman suffrage amendment had passed one Legislature\r\nand it was almost certain that it would pass a second and be voted on\r\nat the fall election of 1915. New York was recognized as an immensely\r\ndifficult State to win. It contained great areas of sparsely settled\r\ncountry and also many large cities. It had a foreign born population\r\nof 2,500,000 in a total of 9,000,000. The political \"machines\" of both\r\nRepublican and Democratic parties were well intrenched and there was\r\nno doubt that the powerful influence of both would be used to the\r\nutmost against a woman suffrage amendment. Party leaders might allow\r\nit to go through the Legislature because confident of their ability to\r\ndefeat it at the polls. The vital problem for the suffragists was how\r\nto organize and unite all the friendly forces.\r\n\r\nWhile the State Suffrage Association was the one which was organized\r\nmost extensively there were other important societies. For some years\r\nthe Women's Political Union, Mrs. Harriot Stanton Blatch president,\r\nhad carried on an effective campaign. The Woman Suffrage Party, a\r\nlarge group, existed principally in New York City, organized by\r\nassembly districts. The Men's League for Woman Suffrage comprised a\r\nconsiderable number of influential men, now under the presidency of\r\nJames Lees Laidlaw. The College Equal Suffrage League, Mrs. Charles L.\r\nTiffany, president, was an active body of young women. The Equal\r\nFranchise Society, organized originally among the society women of New\r\nYork City by Mrs. Clarence Mackay had Mrs. Howard Mansfield as\r\npresident and had helped make the movement \"fashionable.\" This was the\r\ncase with Mrs. Oliver H. P. Belmont's Political Equality League.\r\n\r\nOn April 15, 1913, Miss Mills had invited representatives of these\r\norganizations to a conference at the State headquarters in New York to\r\nconsider concerted action at which Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt was urged\r\nto become chairman of a State Campaign Committee composed of their\r\npresidents. Before accepting, Mrs. Catt, in order to learn conditions\r\nin the State, sent out a questionnaire to county presidents and\r\nassembly district leaders asking their opinion as to the prospect of\r\nsuccess. Of the forty-two who answered twelve believed that their\r\ncounties might be carried for the amendment if enough work was done;\r\nsixteen thought it doubtful, no matter how much work was done, and\r\nfourteen were certain they could not be carried under any conditions.\r\nNot a single county believed it could organize or finance its own\r\nwork. In spite of the discouraging situation, Mrs. Catt on her return\r\nin the autumn from the meeting in Budapest of the International Woman\r\nSuffrage Alliance, of which she was president, accepted the\r\nchairmanship on the condition that $20,000 should be raised for the\r\nwork. The Empire State Committee organized November 11 was composed of\r\nMrs. Raymond Brown, representing the State Association; Miss Mary\r\nGarrett Hay, the Woman Suffrage Party of New York City; Mrs.\r\nMansfield, the Equal Franchise Society; Mrs. Tiffany, the College\r\nLeague and Mr. Laidlaw, the Men's League, with the following chairmen:\r\nMiss Rose Young, Press; Mrs. Warner M. Leeds, Finance; Mrs. Norman\r\ndeR. Whitehouse, Publicity; Mrs. John W. Alexander, Art; Mrs.\r\nMansfield, Literature.[133]\r\n\r\nFor convenience of work the State was divided into twelve campaign\r\ndistricts, whose chairmen were, 1st, Miss Hay, New York City; 2nd,\r\nMrs. Brown, Bellport, Long Island; 3rd, Miss Leila Stott, Albany; 4th,\r\nMrs. Frank Paddock, Malone; 5th, Mrs. L. O. McDaniel, succeeded by\r\nMiss Mills, Syracuse; 6th, Mrs. Helen B. Owens, Ithaca; 7th, Mrs.\r\nAlice C. Clement, Rochester; 8th, Mrs. Nettie Rogers Shuler, Buffalo;\r\n9th, Mrs. Carl Osterheld, Yonkers; 10th, Mrs. Gordon Norrie,\r\nStaatsburg; 11th, Miss Evanetta Hare, succeeded by Mrs. George Notman,\r\nKeene Valley; 12th, Miss Lucy C. Watson, Utica. Under all of these\r\nchairmen came the 150 assembly district leaders and under these the\r\n5,524 election district captains. From the first it was realized that\r\norganization was the keynote to success and that to be effective it\r\nmust extend into every polling precinct of the State. Mrs. Catt had no\r\nsuperior in organizing ability. The plan followed the lines of the\r\npolitical parties and was already in use by the Woman Suffrage Party\r\nof New York City, which she had founded.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1914, Campaign District Conferences and Schools of Method\r\nwere held, followed by a convention and mass meetings in every county.\r\nDuring the year twenty-eight paid organizers were constantly at work.\r\nMrs. Catt herself visited fifty of the up-state counties. The annual\r\nState convention October 12-16, was preceded by a state-wide motor car\r\npilgrimage. On every highway was a procession of cars stopping along\r\nthe route for street meetings and converging in Rochester for the\r\nconvention. There was little change in officers. Three vice-presidents\r\nwere added, Mrs. Alfred E. Lewis of Geneva, Mrs. Livermore, Mrs.\r\nNotman. Mrs. Cannon was succeeded as corresponding secretary by Miss\r\nMarion May of New York. Mrs. Abbott and Mrs. Shuler were added to the\r\nboard of directors. A comprehensive program of work for 1914-15, laid\r\nout by Mrs. Catt, gave a definite task for each month and included\r\nraising a $150,000 campaign fund, each district being assigned a\r\nproportion; school for suffrage workers, special suffrage edition of a\r\nnewspaper in every county, automobile campaign, work at county fairs\r\nand a house to house canvass to enroll the names of women who wanted\r\nthe suffrage. Mrs. Catt's plan also included parades in all the large\r\ncities and schools in every county to train watchers for the polls.\r\n\r\nAs was expected the resolution for the suffrage amendment was passed\r\nby the Legislature of 1915, the vote to be taken on the day of the\r\nregular election, November 2. Forty paid organizers were kept in the\r\nfield and a convention was held again in each county. By autumn each\r\nof the 150 assembly districts was organized and in addition there were\r\n565 clubs and 183 campaign committees. About 2,500 women held official\r\npositions, serving without pay. It was estimated that about 200,000\r\nwomen worked in some capacity in this campaign. Twelve thousand New\r\nYork City public school teachers formed a branch under Katharine\r\nDevereux Blake as chairman. Each paid fifty cents dues and many gave\r\ntheir summer vacation to work for the amendment.\r\n\r\nThe Equal Franchise Society, in charge of the literature, printed\r\n7,230,000 leaflets, requiring twenty tons of paper; 657,200 booklets,\r\none full set sent to every political leader in the State; 592,000\r\nCongressional hearings and individual speeches were mailed to voters;\r\n149,533 posters were put up and 1,000,000 suffrage buttons were used;\r\n200,000 cards of matches with \"Vote Yes on the Suffrage Amendment\" on\r\nthe back were distributed and 35,000 fans carrying the suffrage map.\r\n\r\nThe value of street speaking had long since been learned. A woman\r\nspeaking from an automobile or a soap box or steps, while she might\r\nbegin by addressing a few children would usually draw a crowd of men\r\nof the kind who could never be gotten inside a hall, and these men\r\nwere voters. The effect of these outdoor meetings was soon seen all\r\nover the State in the rapidly changing sentiment of the man in the\r\nstreet. During the six months preceding the election 10,325 meetings\r\nwere recorded besides the countless ones not reported. Mass meetings\r\nwere held in 124 different cities, sixteen in New York, with U. S.\r\nSenators and Representatives and other prominent speakers. The week\r\nbefore election in New York, Buffalo, Rochester and other large cities\r\nMarathon speeches were made continuously throughout the twenty-four\r\nhours, with listening crowds even during the small hours of the night.\r\nSuffrage speeches were given in moving picture shows and vaudeville\r\ntheaters and a suffrage motion picture play was produced. Flying\r\nsquadrons of trained workers would go into a city, make a canvass,\r\nhold street meetings, attract public attention and stimulate newspaper\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nA remarkable piece of work was done by a Press and Publicity Council\r\nof one hundred women in New York City organized by Mrs. Whitehouse.\r\nThey established personal acquaintance with the editors and owners of\r\nthe fifteen daily papers; answered the anti-suffrage letters\r\npublished; communicated with the editors of 683 trade journals, 21\r\nreligious papers, 126 foreign language papers and many others--893 in\r\nall--and offered them exclusive articles; they suggested special\r\nfeatures for magazines and planned suffrage covers; they secured space\r\nfor a suffrage calendar in every daily paper. This council placed\r\nsuffrage slides in moving picture houses and suffrage posters in the\r\nlobbies of theaters; and had a page advertisement of suffrage in every\r\ntheater program. Comedians were asked to make references to suffrage\r\nin their plays and jokes were collected for them and appropriate lines\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\nA sub-committee of writers was organized which assembled material for\r\nspecial suffrage editions of papers, wrote suffrage articles and made\r\nsuggestions for stories. The Art Committee illustrated the special\r\neditions and made cartoons. They held an exhibit of suffrage posters\r\nwith prizes and raised money through an exhibition and sale of the\r\nwork of women painters and sculptors. A new suffrage game was invented\r\nand installed at Coney Island. They supplied the posters for $70,000\r\nworth of advertising space on billboards and street cars which was\r\ncontributed by the owners during the final weeks of the campaign. They\r\norganized and managed the suffrage banner parade, the largest which\r\nhad yet taken place.\r\n\r\nAmong the other publicity \"stunts\" of the council were suffrage\r\nbaseball games, a Fourth of July celebration at the Statue of Liberty\r\nand Telephone and Telegraph Day, when the wires carried suffrage\r\nmessages to politicians, judges, editors, clergymen, governors,\r\nmayors, etc., all of these \"stunts\" receiving a large amount of\r\nnewspaper publicity. The most effective was the One Day Strike, to\r\nanswer the argument used by the \"antis\" that \"woman's place was in the\r\nhome\" by asking all women to stay at home for only one day. The\r\nsuggestion was never intended to be carried out and did not go further\r\nthan a letter sent by Mrs. Whitehouse to the presidents of women's\r\nclubs and some other organizations, asking them to come to a meeting\r\nto consider the plan, copies of which were sent to the newspapers. The\r\neffect was extraordinary. Department stores, telephone company\r\nmanagers, employers of all kinds of women's labor, hospitals and\r\nschools, protested loudly against the crippling of public service, the\r\nloss of profits and the disruption of business which would result from\r\neven one day's absence of women from their public places. Editorial\r\nwriters devoted columns to denouncing the proposal. Suffrage leaders\r\nwere bitterly criticized for even suggesting such a public calamity.\r\nThe favorite argument of the \"antis\" was answered for all time.\r\n\r\nAt the very end of the campaign the anti-suffragists began to\r\nadvertise extensively in the subway and on the elevated roads in New\r\nYork City but the firm that controlled this space refused to accept\r\nany advertising from the suffragists. Woman's wit, however, was equal\r\nto the emergency. For the three days preceding the election one\r\nhundred women gave their time to riding on elevated and subway trains\r\nholding up large placards on which were printed answers to the \"anti\"\r\nadvertisements. The public understood and treated the women with much\r\ncourtesy.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to give even the barest outline of the work of the\r\nPress Bureau, at first under the management of Mrs. Haryot Holt Dey\r\nand later of Miss Rose Young, with a volunteer force of 214 press\r\nchairmen over the State. There were 2,136 publications in the State,\r\n211 dailies, 1,117 weeklies, 628 monthlies, and 180 foreign\r\npublications printed in twenty-five languages. To the weeklies a\r\nbulletin from the central bureau went regularly; 3,036 shipments were\r\nmade of pages of plate matter. The American Press Association and the\r\nWestern Newspaper Union for many weeks sent out columns of suffrage\r\nnews with their regular service for the patent inside page used by\r\ncountry papers. The bureau furnished material for debates and answered\r\nattacks against suffrage. The support given by the newspapers was of\r\ngreat value. Of the fifteen dailies of New York City ten were\r\npro-suffrage, while the rural press was overwhelmingly in favor. Most\r\nof the papers of the larger cities up-state were opposed, although\r\nthere were notable exceptions.\r\n\r\nThere were several high water marks. On Nov. 6, 1914, just a year\r\nbefore the election, at a mass meeting which packed Carnegie Hall,\r\n$115,000 were pledged, the largest sum ever raised at a suffrage\r\nmeeting, a visible proof of the great increase in favorable sentiment\r\nsince the campaign had begun a year ago, when the $20,000 which Mrs.\r\nCatt wanted as the original guarantee seemed almost impossible of\r\nattainment. In May, 1915, a luncheon attended by 1,400 people pledged\r\n$50,000. On October 23, ten days before election, there occurred in\r\nNew York City the largest parade ever organized in the United States\r\nfor suffrage, called the \"banner parade\" because of the multitude of\r\nflags and banners which characterized it, only those for suffrage\r\nbeing permitted. There were 33,783 women who marched up Fifth Avenue,\r\npast a crowd of spectators which was record-breaking, taking from 2\r\no'clock in the afternoon until long after dark. The rear was brought\r\nup by scores of motor cars gaily decorated with Chinese lanterns and\r\nafter darkness fell the avenue was a solid mass of moving colored\r\nlights. There seemed no end to the women who were determined to win\r\nthe vote and a multitude of men seemed to be ready to grant it.\r\n\r\nOn Nov. 2, 1915, the vote took place. Every preparation had been made\r\nand every precaution taken, as far as the strength of the organization\r\nwould permit, to secure a fair election and an honest count. A law had\r\nbeen obtained which permitted women to act as watchers at any election\r\non woman suffrage, which proved an important safeguard. Wherever\r\npossible, watchers were provided for the polling places all over the\r\nState. The result of the election was: For the suffrage amendment,\r\n553,348; against, 748,332; adverse majority 194,984.\r\n\r\nThe disappointment was almost crushing. Although the task of\r\npersuading the huge cosmopolitan population of New York State to grant\r\nequality to women had been recognized as being almost superhuman, the\r\nwork done had been so colossal that it would have been impossible not\r\nto hope for success. Mrs. Catt had planned and seen carried out a\r\nmasterly campaign never before approached anywhere in the history of\r\nsuffrage. The devotion and self-sacrifice of thousands of women were\r\nbeyond praise but there were not enough of them. If every county and\r\nevery town had raised its proportion of the funds and done its share\r\nof the work, the amendment might have been carried, but this first\r\ncampaign laid the foundation for the victory that the next one would\r\nbring.\r\n\r\nThis was the largest vote ever polled for suffrage at any\r\nelection--553,348 out of a vote of 1,300,880, being 42-1/2 per cent.\r\nThe vote in the State outside of New York City was 427,479 noes,\r\n315,250 ayes, opposing majority, 112,229; in this city 320,853 noes,\r\n238,098 ayes, opposing majority 82,755; total opposed, 194,984. The\r\namendment received a larger favorable vote than the Republican party\r\npolled at the Presidential election of 1912, which was 455,428. In\r\n1914 this party swept the State and it could have carried the suffrage\r\namendment in 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND NEW YORK CAMPAIGN.\r\n\r\nWith 42-1/2 per cent. of the vote cast in November, 1915, in favor of\r\nthe woman suffrage amendment the leaders were eager to start a new\r\ncampaign at once and take advantage of the momentum already gained.\r\nTwo nights after election the campaign was started at a mass meeting\r\nin Cooper Union, New York City, where $100,000 were pledged amid\r\nboundless enthusiasm. The reorganization of the State took place\r\nimmediately, at the annual convention held in this city, November\r\n30-December 2, and all the societies that had cooperated in the Empire\r\nState Campaign Committee became consolidated under the name of the\r\nState Woman Suffrage Party, into which the old State association was\r\nmerged. The demand was so overwhelming that Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,\r\nwho had led the two years' fight so magnificently, should continue to\r\nbe leader, that she was obliged to accept the chairmanship.\r\n\r\nThe other officers elected were Mrs. Norman deR. Whitehouse, Mrs.\r\nJames Lees Laidlaw, Mrs. Henry W. Cannon, first, second and third\r\nvice-chairmen; Mrs. Michael M. Van Beuren and Miss Alice Morgan\r\nWright, secretaries; Mrs. Ogden Mills Reid, treasurer; Mrs. Raymond\r\nBrown, Mrs. Dexter P. Rumsey, Miss Harriet May Mills and Mrs. Arthur\r\nL. Livermore, directors. A few weeks later the convention of the\r\nNational Association called Mrs. Catt even more insistently to accept\r\nits presidency and Mrs. Whitehouse became chairman and therefore the\r\nleader of the new campaign. Mrs. Catt headed the list of directors;\r\nMrs. Laidlaw was made chairman of legislative work and Mrs. Brown of\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nThe next State convention was held in Albany, Nov. 16-23, 1916, and\r\nthe same officers were elected except that Mrs. Charles Noel Edge\r\nsucceeded Mrs. Van Beuren as secretary. The chairmen of the twelve\r\ncampaign districts were continued with the following changes: Second,\r\nMrs. Frederick Edey, Bellport; fourth, Mrs. Robert D. Ford, Canton;\r\nfifth, Mrs. William F. Canough, Syracuse; sixth, Miss Lillian Huffcut,\r\nBinghamton; eighth, Mrs. Frank J. Tone, Niagara Falls; ninth, Mrs.\r\nFrank A. Vanderlip, Scarborough.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. The determination to enter immediately into\r\nanother campaign met with much opposition, even from many suffragists.\r\nThe Legislature had submitted the amendment in 1915 confident that it\r\nwould be overwhelmingly defeated but the ability and persistence of\r\nthe women and the big vote secured made the opponents afraid to take\r\nanother chance. That it was finally forced through both Houses was\r\ndue, first, to the brilliant legislative work of Mrs. Whitehouse and\r\nMrs. Laidlaw, assisted by Mrs. Helen Leavitt, chairman of legislative\r\nwork for the Albany district; second, to the extraordinary support\r\ngiven by the organizations throughout the State, through delegations,\r\nmass meetings, letters and telegrams, 6,000 from the 9th district\r\nalone. The Men's League gave invaluable help.\r\n\r\nThe resolution was introduced in both branches on Jan. 10, 1916. The\r\nfight centered in the Senate and had as determined opponents Senator\r\nElon F. Brown, floor leader of the Republicans, and Senator Walters,\r\nRepublican chairman of the Judiciary Committee. The Democratic\r\nminority gave it a lukewarm support. Every subterfuge was directed\r\nagainst it. Finally it was reported out of the Assembly Judiciary\r\nCommittee February 15 by a vote of 11 to one and then there was a\r\nstandstill. The Senate Judiciary Committee constantly postponed\r\naction. At last 500 women came to the Capitol on March 14 to urge\r\nimmediate action and the resolution was adopted in the Assembly that\r\nday by 109 ayes to 30 noes.\r\n\r\nThe Senate Committee had promised that it would report that same day,\r\nand at 2 p. m. it went into executive session and the suffrage leaders\r\ncamped outside the door. That evening a suffrage ball was to take\r\nplace in Madison Square Garden, New York City, which they were to\r\nopen, and the last train that would reach there in time left Albany at\r\n6 o'clock. The Committee knew this but hour after hour went by without\r\nword from it. After time for the train a friendly Senator appeared and\r\nannounced that it had adjourned sometime before without taking action\r\nand had gone out the back way in order to escape from the waiting\r\nwatchers! Taking the next train and arriving in New York at 10 o'clock\r\nat night the suffragists drove direct to Madison Square Garden. As\r\nthey approached it they saw great throngs outside storming the doors,\r\nwhich had been closed by the police as it was dangerously crowded.\r\nThey succeeded in getting in and were greeted by cheers as they led\r\nthe grand march, which had been awaiting their arrival. At midnight\r\nMrs. Whitehouse and Mrs. Laidlaw took the sleeper back to Albany and\r\nwere on hand at the opening of the session the next morning. Such\r\nundaunted spirit caught the public imagination and the newspapers did\r\nit full justice, with big headlines and columns of copy, but still the\r\nbill did not pass.\r\n\r\nThe final pressure which put the amendment through was a clever bit of\r\nstrategy due to Mrs. Whitehouse. In answer to her appeal editorials\r\nappeared in newspapers throughout the State saying that no group of\r\nmen in Albany had the right to strangle the amendment or refuse the\r\nvoters the privilege of passing on it. On March 22 the Senate\r\nCommittee reported the resolution by 11 ayes, one no. On April 10 it\r\npassed the Senate by 33 ayes, 10 noes.\r\n\r\nIn 1917 the amendment was passed again to go to the voters at the\r\nregular election November 6. The State Woman Suffrage Party\r\nstrengthened its organization with the goal of a captain for every\r\npolling precinct, each with a committee of ten women to look after\r\nthe individual voters. Larger cities had a chairman and board of\r\nofficers combined with the assembly and election district\r\norganization. In Buffalo, Mrs. Thew Wright headed a capable board; in\r\nRochester one was led by Mrs. Alice Clement, later by Mrs. Henry G.\r\nDanforth; in Syracuse by Mrs. Mary Hyde Andrews; in Utica by Miss Lucy\r\nC. Watson. By the end of the campaign, in addition to volunteers, 88\r\ntrained organizers were at work in the 57 counties outside of Greater\r\nNew York. The National Suffrage Association contributed four of its\r\nbest workers and paid their salaries. Connecticut, New Jersey,\r\nPennsylvania, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and some of the southern\r\nand western States sent valuable workers.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1917 the entire organization was well developed and suffrage\r\nwork was at its height when it was suddenly stopped short by the\r\nentrance of the United States into the World War. At once everything\r\nelse became of secondary importance. The Suffrage Party, like all\r\norganizations of women, was eager to serve the country and seized the\r\nfirst opportunity, which came with the order from Governor Charles S.\r\nWhitman for a military census of all the men and women of the State\r\nover 21 years of age. Entire responsibility for organizing and\r\ncarrying on this work in several counties was given to the party. From\r\nApril to August the suffrage campaign was almost entirely suspended\r\nwhile its leaders took a prominent part in war activities. It was only\r\nabout three months before election that the suffrage issue again\r\nbecame dominant. The amendment must come before the voters at the\r\nNovember election. With the United States engaged in a World War for\r\ndemocracy it seemed impossible to allow democracy to be defeated at\r\nhome, and therefore it was decided that the suffrage campaign must be\r\ncarried on.\r\n\r\nIn spite of some opposition Mrs. Whitehouse called a State conference\r\nat Saratoga the end of August. Besides the distraction caused by the\r\nwar other difficulties had arisen. The White House at Washington had\r\nbeen \"picketed\" by the National Woman's Party and the President burned\r\nin effigy as a protest because the Federal Suffrage Amendment had not\r\nbeen submitted by Congress. The press was filled with the story and\r\nthe public was indignant. Because the country was at war and the\r\nPresident burdened with heavy responsibilities, reproaches of\r\ndisloyalty and pro-Germanism were hurled at suffragists in general.\r\nThe officers of the National Association had repeatedly condemned the\r\n\"militancy\" and repudiated all responsibility for it but to the public\r\ngenerally all suffragists looked alike and people did not at first\r\nrecognize the difference between the small group of \"pickets\" and the\r\ngreat suffrage organization of almost countless numbers. New York\r\nworkers were very resentful because a direct appeal to suspend the\r\n\"picketing\" until after the election was refused by the leaders of the\r\nWoman's Party. The Saratoga conference adopted a resolution of\r\ndisapproval.\r\n\r\nAt a mass meeting in New York soon afterwards Governor Whitman, Mayor\r\nMitchel and other prominent men spoke most encouragingly, but on\r\nSeptember 10 a suffrage amendment was defeated in Maine by a vote of\r\ntwo to one and this had a disastrous effect on the New York situation.\r\nIt discouraged the workers and many newspapers which had been\r\nfriendly, anticipating a similar defeat in New York, became hostile in\r\ntone; also because of the pressure of war news, the papers were almost\r\nclosed to suffrage matter. Mass meetings which formerly were crowded\r\nwere now so poorly attended that many had to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nIn order to help the chances of the amendment President Wilson on\r\nOctober 25 received a delegation of one hundred of the most prominent\r\nwomen of the Party, headed by Mrs. Whitehouse. He expressed his\r\nappreciation of the war work of women and his thorough belief that\r\nthey should have the suffrage, praising the New York campaign and\r\nsaying: \"I am very glad to add my voice to those which are urging the\r\npeople of your State to set a great example by voting for woman\r\nsuffrage. It would be a pleasure if I might utter that advice in their\r\npresence, but, as I am bound too close to my duties here to make that\r\npossible, I am glad to ask you to convey that message to them....\"\r\n\r\nThis address was published far and wide and had a marked effect on the\r\nvoters. Later the President wrote Mrs. Catt that he hoped no voter in\r\nNew York would be influenced by anything the so-called \"pickets\" had\r\ndone in Washington. The suffrage meetings were soon again crowded. On\r\nOctober 27 the final parade took place in New York City. The\r\nsignatures of 1,014,000 women citizens of the State, of voting age,\r\nasking for suffrage had been obtained. Those from up-State were pasted\r\non huge cardboards and carried in the parade by delegations from the\r\nvarious counties. Those from the city were placed in 62 huge ballot\r\nboxes, one for each assembly district, with the number of them on the\r\noutside, and carried by the \"captains\" of the districts and their\r\nhelpers.\r\n\r\nThe largest registration of men voters in the State was 1,942,000;\r\nthere were nearly 100,000 more men than women of voting age and many\r\nmore men than women were naturalized, therefore it was evident that\r\n1,014,000 signatures represented a good majority of women eligible to\r\nvote. This enormous piece of work was done almost entirely by\r\nvolunteers. For many months women in every county went from door to\r\ndoor, preaching suffrage, asking wives to talk to their husbands about\r\nit and leaving literature. The effect of this personal education was\r\nundoubtedly great and the petition influenced public opinion.\r\n\r\nThe propaganda carried on by the Educational section under Mrs. Howard\r\nMansfield was enormous, including training schools, travelling\r\nlibraries and 8,000 sets of correspondence courses sent out. Women\r\nwere trained in watchers' schools for work at the polls and 15,000\r\nleaflets of instructions were furnished. Over 11,000,000 pieces of\r\nliterature, 7 million posters and nearly 200,000 suffrage novelties\r\nwere used, in addition to the 5,000,000 pieces used in New York City.\r\nThe Industrial Section, under Miss Mary E. Dreier, president of the\r\nWomen's Trade Union League, made effective appeals to organized labor.\r\nA series of letters setting forth the conditions under which women\r\nwork and their relation to the vote were distributed at factory doors\r\nas men left for home during the last fifteen weeks of the campaign.\r\nOrganizers and speakers from their own ranks, men and women, spoke at\r\ntrade union meetings, in factories and on the street. The State\r\nFederation of Labor endorsed the work and the Women's Trade Union\r\nLeague gave constant help. The Church Section, under Miss Adella\r\nPotter, was very successful in its appeal with specially prepared\r\nliterature and the churches were an active force.\r\n\r\nEvery registered voter was circularized at least once and many twice.\r\nSpecial letters and literature were prepared for picked groups of men,\r\n198,538 letters in all, and speakers were sent to the military camps\r\nwhere this was permitted. The Speakers' Bureau, conducted by Mrs.\r\nVictor Morawetz, had 150 speakers on its lists and a record of 2,015\r\nspeakers placed in the State. Besides these more than 7,000 meetings\r\nwere arranged independently. In New York City 58 speakers held 2,085\r\nmeetings, a total of 11,100. Senators and Representatives from the\r\nequal suffrage States were to speak in the closing days of the\r\ncampaign but the war held Congress constantly in session and most of\r\nthe other prominent men who had promised to speak were prevented by\r\nservice for the Government.\r\n\r\nThe Publicity Section, under Mrs. John Blair, advertised the amendment\r\nin every way that human ingenuity could devise. Huge street banners\r\nexhorting men to vote for suffrage hung across the most crowded\r\nstreets in New York and in all the large cities. Every kind of\r\nadvertising medium was used, billboards, street cars, subway and\r\nelevated cars and stations, railroad cars and stations; large electric\r\nsigns and painted illuminated signs flashed weeks before election, the\r\nslogan most often used being, \"1,014,000 Women ask you to Vote for\r\nWoman Suffrage November 6.\"\r\n\r\nFor the last two weeks a great campaign of newspaper advertising was\r\ncarried on. There appeared almost daily in 728 morning and evening\r\npapers, including many in foreign languages, pages of suffrage\r\nargument, and as a result the news columns began to be filled again\r\nwith suffrage. The Press Bureau, Miss Rose Young, director, assisted\r\nby local press chairmen, continued as in the first campaign but with\r\nan increased output, news bulletins, editorial matter, special\r\narticles, material for special editions, photographs, newspaper cuts,\r\nstatements from one hundred leading New York City and State men\r\nheaded, Why I am for Woman Suffrage, etc. About 20,000 columns of free\r\nplate material were provided for the newspapers.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to give the total cost of the campaign with\r\naccuracy. As far as possible each district supported its own work. The\r\ncentral State treasury spent $413,353; New York City, $151,504; the\r\ncounties outside of the city $127,296; a total of $692,153, besides\r\nthe large amount spent locally. The raising of the central State funds\r\nwas the work of the treasurer, Mrs. Ogden Mills Reid, assisted by Mrs.\r\nWhitehouse. A budget was prepared to which a group of prominent men,\r\nincluding several bankers, gave their endorsement, and, armed with\r\ntheir letter and helped by them in making appointments, Mrs. Reid and\r\nMrs. Whitehouse called on one man and woman after another of a\r\ncarefully selected list, solicited contributions, and many large\r\namounts were given by persons who had not before been brought in touch\r\nwith suffrage work. New York City led with $183,387; Yonkers came next\r\nwith $41,748 and Buffalo with $30,163.\r\n\r\nThe supreme test of the organization came on election day. It was\r\nhoped to cover every polling space with women watchers and probably\r\nabout 80 per cent. of the total number of election districts of the\r\nState were so covered. A total of 6,330 women served, many being on\r\nduty from 5 a. m. till midnight.\r\n\r\nOn election night all over the State suffrage headquarters were open\r\nand victory seemed in the air. Bulletin boards in New York City showed\r\nthe amendment winning in every borough and wires from up-State gave\r\nencouraging reports. The State headquarters, an entire floor of the\r\nlarge office building at 303 Fifth Avenue, New York, and the city\r\nheadquarters were thronged with happy crowds. Before midnight it\r\nseemed certain that the four years of continuous campaign had resulted\r\nin final victory for New York State, the stronghold of opposition, the\r\nkey to a Federal Suffrage Amendment because of its large\r\nrepresentation and power in Congress. When the complete returns came\r\nin it was found that suffrage had lost up-State by 1,510 votes and\r\nthat it was New York City which carried the amendment by its majority\r\nof 103,863, which reduced by 1,510 left a total majority of 102,353.\r\n\r\nThere were some evidences of fraud but the change of sentiment in\r\nfavor of suffrage was State-wide, and every county showed a gain. The\r\ncities gave a better vote than the rural communities. The greatest\r\noverturn was in Buffalo which changed an adverse majority of 10,822 in\r\n1915 to a favorable one of 4,560 in 1917! The saloons of this city\r\ndisplayed placards, \"Vote No on Woman Suffrage,\" some putting them on\r\nthe outside of the building. Albany, in spite of the fight against the\r\namendment made by the Barnes \"machine,\" although lost, registered a\r\ngain of nearly fifty per cent. Rochester, which was lost, was\r\ndominated by George W. Aldrich, the Republican leader, and Monroe and\r\nadjoining counties were also influenced by their newspapers, which\r\nnearly all were anti-suffrage. In Livingston county, the home of\r\nSenator James W. Wadsworth, Jr., and his wife, who was president of\r\nthe National Anti-Suffrage Association, his influence was so strong\r\nand his financial hold on the county so powerful that even men who\r\nwere in sympathy with woman suffrage were afraid to vote for it. This\r\ninfluence materially reduced the favorable vote in adjoining counties.\r\nThere were several bitter local \"wet\" and \"dry\" fights that were very\r\nbad for the suffrage vote.\r\n\r\nThe Republican Governor, Charles S. Whitman, spoke for the amendment.\r\nHerbert Parsons, the Republican National Committeeman for New York,\r\nand many individual Republicans gave valuable help but the \"machine\"\r\nall over the State did everything possible to defeat the amendment. A\r\nweek before election, when their object was clearly apparent, the\r\nchairman of the Republican State Committee was requested by the women\r\nto write an official letter to its members reminding them of the\r\nendorsement given by the Republican party at its State convention. He\r\nrefused to write it except as an individual and not as State chairman.\r\nIn Rochester an anti-suffrage poster was kept on display in Republican\r\nheadquarters. Among prominent members of the party who used their\r\ninfluence in opposition were Elihu Root, Henry L. Stimson and George\r\nWickersham.\r\n\r\nThe two great figures of the suffrage movement, Mrs. Catt and Dr.\r\nShaw, gave royally to the campaign. Even after Mrs. Catt became\r\npresident of the National Association, she remained on the State Board\r\nof Directors and was a constant help and inspiration. Dr. Shaw\r\ncontributed many weeks of speech making to the first campaign and\r\nalmost as many to the second, although her time in 1917 was much\r\noccupied as chairman of the Woman's Division of the National Council\r\nof Defense. It would be impossible to give the names of the thousands\r\nof women who rendered devoted service during these campaigns and it\r\nwould be equally impossible to mention the names of the men who\r\nhelped. Behind many a woman who worked there was a man aiding and\r\nsustaining her with money and personal sacrifice. \"Suffrage husbands\"\r\nbecame a title of distinction.\r\n\r\nMrs. Whitehouse said in reviewing the causes of the failure of the\r\nfirst campaign, \"We worked like amateurs.\" Such a charge could not be\r\nbrought in the second, for the suffragists became an army of seasoned\r\nveterans, quick to understand and to obey orders, giving suffrage\r\nprecedence over everything else except patriotic work. The amendment\r\nas adopted gave complete suffrage to women on the same terms as\r\nexercised by men and provided that \"a citizen by marriage shall have\r\nbeen an inhabitant of the United States for five years.\" This simply\r\nrequired the same term of residence for wives as for unmarried women\r\nand all men.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom 1910 to 1917 the Men's League for Woman Suffrage was an\r\ninfluential factor in the movement in New York. It was believed to be\r\nthe first of the kind and the idea was said to have originated with\r\nMax Eastman, a young professor in Columbia University, but in a sketch\r\nof the league by him in _The Trend_ in 1913 he said that in 1909, when\r\nhe went to consult Oswald Garrison Villard, editor of the New York\r\n_Evening Post_, he found that Mr. Villard had received a letter from\r\nDr. Anna Howard Shaw, president of the National American Woman\r\nSuffrage Association, asking him to organize such a league; that he\r\nhad conferred with Rabbi Stephen S. Wise and they had \"agreed to share\r\nthe ignominy\" if some one would undertake the organizing. This was\r\ndone by Mr. Eastman, who, armed with letters of introduction by Mr.\r\nVillard, succeeded in getting the names of twelve men of civic\r\ninfluence. Using these names he sent out several thousand letters to\r\nsuch men over the State and finally obtained twenty-five members. In\r\nNovember, 1910, the first meeting was held at the New York City Club\r\nand officers were elected. By good fortune George Foster Peabody was\r\none of the earliest members, a Georgian by birth and one of New\r\nYork's prominent bankers and financiers. He consented to serve as\r\npresident and with this prestige many members were secured. \"The\r\nleague owed its pecuniary life to him,\" said Mr. Eastman, \"and a great\r\npart of its early standing before the public.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the first year the league was equally fortunate in having James\r\nLees Laidlaw, another New York banker and man of affairs, take the\r\npresidency. He retained it for the next six years, and when the\r\nNational Men's League was formed he consented to serve also as its\r\npresident until the contest for woman suffrage was finished, giving\r\nactive and constant assistance. Mr. Eastman was secretary of the New\r\nYork League for a year or more, assisted by Ward Melville, and was\r\nsucceeded by Robert Cameron Beadle, general manager of the U. S.\r\nStoker Corporation. He gave valuable and continuous service to the\r\nleague until just before the campaign of 1917, when the pressure of\r\nbusiness required his time and he became vice-president and George\r\nCreel ably filled the office of secretary during that strenuous\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 the league took part in the first big suffrage parade and no\r\nact of men during the whole history of woman suffrage required more\r\ncourage than that of the 87 who marched up Fifth Avenue on that\r\noccasion, jeered by the crowds that lined the sidewalks. It was a body\r\nof representative citizens, led by Mr. Peabody, Mr. Laidlaw and Mr.\r\nVillard. The league became a large organization, enrolling among its\r\nmembers such men as Governor Charles S. Whitman, Mayor John Purroy\r\nMitchel, Frank A. Vanderlip, Colonel George Harvey, William M. Ivins,\r\nDr. Simon Flexner, Professor John Dewey, Hamilton Holt, William Dean\r\nHowells, John Mitchell, Charles Sprague Smith, Samuel Untermeyer,\r\nHerbert Parsons, President Schurman of Cornell University, President\r\nMcCracken of Vassar College and many Judges, public officials and\r\nothers of note. In the suffrage parade of 1912 the league four abreast\r\nextended five blocks along Fifth Avenue. Under its auspices mass\r\nmeetings were held, district rallies, public dinners with 600 guests,\r\nballs and theatrical performances, and campaign activities of various\r\nkinds were carried on. Men's leagues were formed in many States. The\r\n_Woman Voter_ of October, 1912, published in New York City, issued a\r\nspecial league number, with sketches, pictures, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Women's Political Union, which under the name of the Equality\r\nLeague of Self-Supporting Women was formed in New York City in the\r\nautumn of 1906 by Mrs. Harriot Stanton Blatch, was an active force for\r\nmany years. Its object was to bring to suffrage the strength of women\r\nengaged in wage-earning occupations and under its aegis trade-union\r\nwomen first pleaded their cause before a legislative committee on Feb.\r\n6, 1907. That spring the league held two suffrage mass meetings, the\r\nfirst for many years in Cooper Union, and the following year Carnegie\r\nHall was for the first time invaded by woman suffrage with a meeting\r\nin honor of Mrs. Emmeline Pankhurst, the leader of the English\r\n\"militant\" suffragists.\r\n\r\nThe league sent over 300 women to Albany by special train on Feb. 19,\r\n1908, to a hearing on a woman suffrage amendment. The same year it\r\nstarted open air meetings throughout the State. On election day in\r\n1909 the Union distributed literature at the polls and five members\r\ntested the right of women to act as watchers. It made the innovation\r\nof interviewing candidates and pledging them to vote, if elected, for\r\nthe submission of a suffrage amendment to the electors.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 the Union organized in New York the first suffrage foot parade\r\nof 400 women, and other larger ones afterwards. In September it began\r\na vigorous campaign against Artemus Ward, Republican candidate for\r\nre-election to the Assembly in a banner Republican district in New\r\nYork City, because of his hostility to the suffrage amendment.\r\nPedestrians could not go a block in the district without hearing a\r\nsoap box orator trying to defeat him. The night before election\r\neighty-six out-door meetings were held. Although it could not defeat\r\nhim his former majority of 2,276 was reduced to 190. In 1911 it\r\nengineered campaigns against Cuvillier in Manhattan and Carrew in\r\nBrooklyn for the same reason, distributing over 100,000 pieces of\r\nliterature in opposing the latter, who had an adverse majority of over\r\n2,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1911 the Union took 400 women to Albany and in 1912 the largest\r\nsuffrage delegation which had ever gone there. They practically\r\ncompelled consideration of the suffrage resolution and after its\r\ndefeat campaigned against the enemies, ending the political careers\r\nof some of them. Before election day the files of the Union contained\r\nsigned pledges from every candidate for the Legislature in 45 of the\r\n51 Senate districts and in 85 of the 150 Assembly districts. On Jan.\r\n23, 1913, the Senate voted 40 to 2 for the amendment and on the 27th\r\nthe Assembly concurred with but five adverse votes. On May 3, the\r\nUnion organized a parade of victory in New York City.\r\n\r\nDuring the great campaign of 1915 the Union was constantly evolving\r\nnew features to draw attention to the amendment. It closed its\r\nactivities with a luncheon of a thousand covers at the Hotel Astor\r\njust before election day in honor of the 100th anniversary of the\r\nbirth of Elizabeth Cady Stanton. After the defeat it amalgamated with\r\nthe Congressional Union, abandoned State work and centered its efforts\r\non an amendment to the Federal Constitution. Throughout its existence\r\nMrs. Blatch was president, Elizabeth Ellsworth Cook, vice-president,\r\nMarcia Townsend, treasurer, Eunice Dana Brannan, chairman of finance,\r\nNora Stanton Blatch, editor of the _Women's Political World_, the\r\norgan of the society; Caroline Lexow, field secretary and Alberta Hill\r\nand Florence Maule Cooley, executive secretaries. [Information\r\nfurnished by Mrs. Blatch.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn important feature of the campaign in New York City and in other\r\nparts of the State was the work of the St. Catherine Welfare\r\nAssociation of Catholic women, organized by Miss Sara McPike,\r\nexecutive secretary of the advertising department of a large\r\ncorporation, and Miss Winifred Sullivan, a lawyer. Its object was\r\nbetter social and economic conditions for women and children and the\r\nextension of the suffrage to women as a means to this end. Its leaders\r\nand prominent members worked with the State and city suffrage\r\nassociations also but through their own they could carry the message\r\ninto the different sodalities and fraternal organizations of the\r\nchurch and to its summer schools and conventions. Bishops and priests\r\nwere interviewed and a number of the latter were persuaded to speak at\r\nthe meetings held in twenty-six prominent parish school halls in New\r\nYork City. Ten meetings were held in Brooklyn and others in\r\nsurrounding towns.\r\n\r\nLeaflets of opinions favorable to woman suffrage by the Catholic\r\nclergy were prepared and widely circulated among priests, educators\r\nand laymen. Space was secured in the Catholic press. Letters without\r\nnumber were written. A delegation was received by Cardinal Gibbons in\r\nBaltimore to explain the desire of its members for the vote. Many of\r\nthe clergy looked with favor on their work, which encouraged Catholic\r\nwomen to take part in it, and 500 marched under the banner of the\r\nassociation in the last suffrage parade in New York in October, 1917.\r\nMiss McPike devoted every hour of her time outside of business hours\r\nand gave $800 to the work of the association. Mrs. Mary C. Brown was a\r\ngenerous contributor. Among the countless members who helped\r\nunceasingly by writing, speaking and in many other ways were Elizabeth\r\nJordan, Janet Richards, Mrs. William A. Prendergast, Countess Mackin,\r\nMrs. Schuyler Warren, Sara H. Fahey, Mrs. William H. Yorke, Anne Sands\r\nO'Shea, Catharine G. Hogan, Helen Haines, Aimee Hutchinson, Mary C.\r\nLarkin, May H. Morey, Frances Gallogly, Annie Nolan, Rose and Fanny\r\nFlannelly. The activities of the association were extended into\r\nPennsylvania, New Jersey and other States.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe success of the suffrage amendment did not mean the disbanding of\r\nthe organization. At the 49th State convention, held in New York City,\r\nNov. 20-22, 1917, Mrs. Whitehouse was re-elected chairman, Mrs.\r\nLaidlaw vice-chairman, and most of the old officers were retained. It\r\nwas decided to make the Federal Suffrage Amendment the chief object\r\nand in order to work more effectively the State was organized by\r\nCongressional districts, with the Assembly district organization\r\nretained. Early in 1918 Mrs. Whitehouse, because of her remarkable\r\nwork in the suffrage campaign, was selected by the Government's\r\nCommittee on Public Information to go to Switzerland. Mrs. Laidlaw was\r\nelected chairman at the convention and the name of the State Woman\r\nSuffrage Party was changed to the State League of Women Voters. Even\r\nbefore the war was ended an enormous work was begun throughout the\r\nState, under Mrs. Laidlaw, toward the political training of the more\r\nthan a million women who had been enfranchised. This was continued\r\nunder Mrs. Frank A. Vanderlip, who was elected chairman of the State\r\nLeague of Women Voters, officially formed April 8, 1919.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Suffrage Amendment was submitted by Congress June 4, 1919.\r\nSenator William M. Calder voted in favor, Senator Wadsworth continuing\r\nhis opposition to the end. Of the Representatives, 35 voted in favor;\r\nfive were absent; three, Riordan of New York, Dunn of Rochester and\r\nSanders of Stafford, voted no.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. The ratification of this amendment by the State\r\nLegislatures became the pressing question and as most of them had\r\nadjourned for two years it would be necessary to have this done by\r\nspecial sessions if women were to vote in the November election of\r\n1920. That of New York would meet in January, 1920, so there was no\r\nneed of haste, but Mrs. Catt at once took up the matter with Governor\r\nAlfred E. Smith, pointing out the excellent effect on other States if\r\nNew York should have a special session for this purpose. Without\r\nhesitation he issued the call on June 10, with a strong appeal for\r\nratification. The Legislature met on June 16 and immediately the\r\nAssembly ratified by unanimous vote of 137. The resolution went at\r\nonce to the Senate, where Henry M. Sage made a speech against it and\r\nasked to be excused from voting. It was then passed by unanimous vote,\r\nthe Legislature being in session less than a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[122] The History is indebted for this part of the chapter to Mrs.\r\nElla Hawley Crossett, president of the State Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation, 1902-1910.\r\n\r\n[123] Mary Anthony left to Mrs. Crossett, Miss Mills and Isabel\r\nHowland $1,000 to be used for State work as they thought best.

This year,\r\nwithout any outside pressure, a handful of awakening women met on July\r\n10 at the home of Dr. Isaac M. Taylor of Morgantown to arrange for\r\ngathering into a club those in sympathy with the woman suffrage\r\nmovement. Those present were Mrs. Taylor, Mrs. Hosfeldt, Mrs. Hughson,\r\nMiss Allen, Miss Riddell, Miss Julia Erwin and Miss Kate Pearsall, who\r\nwas elected secretary. Mrs. Hosfeldt was chosen for president and Miss\r\nMamie Collett for vice-president. Mrs. Hughson, Mrs. Taylor and Miss\r\nErwin were appointed to formulate the purposes of the society which it\r\nwas agreed to call the Morgantown Equal Suffrage Association.\r\n\r\nAt the next meeting in Miss Erwin's home July 14 Miss Coffey acted as\r\nrecording secretary and the organization was completed. Societies were\r\nformed in Greenville and Charlotte and through the efforts of Miss\r\nSusanne Bynum and Miss Anna Forbes Liddell of Charlotte a meeting was\r\ncalled in that city in November to form a State Association. The\r\nfollowing officers were chosen: President, Mrs. Archibald Henderson,\r\nChapel Hill; vice presidents, Mrs. Eugene Reilley, Charlotte; Miss\r\nGertrude Weil, Goldsboro; Mrs. Malcolm Platt, Asheville; corresponding\r\nsecretary, Miss Bynum; recording secretary, Miss Liddell; treasurer,\r\nMrs. David Stern, Greensboro. Mrs. Lila Meade Valentine, president of\r\nthe Virginia Equal Suffrage League, was the principal speaker. A\r\ncharter was subsequently obtained for the Equal Suffrage League of\r\nNorth Carolina, Inc., the charter members numbering about 200 men and\r\nwomen, representing every class and section in the State. The League\r\nbecame auxiliary to the National Association. At this time, when it\r\nwas far from popular to stand for this cause, Judge Walter Clark,\r\nChief Justice of the Supreme Court; Gen. Julian S. Carr, Archibald\r\nHenderson, Wade Harris and E. K. Graham acted as Advisory Committee\r\nand gave freely of their time and money to help the new league.\r\n\r\nThe first annual State convention was held in Charlotte, Nov. 9-10,\r\n1914, Mrs. Henderson presiding. During this first year Mrs. Medill\r\nMcCormick, chairman of the Congressional Committee of the National\r\nAssociation, was of the greatest assistance in many ways. She sent an\r\norganizer, Miss Lavinia Engle, who, with Mrs. Henderson, distributed\r\nliterature throughout the State and organized a number of branches.\r\nThe State League recorded itself as opposed to \"militancy\" in any form\r\nand as desiring \"to gain the vote by appeal to reason and fair play.\"\r\nThe Charlotte _Observer_ carried a four-page suffrage section\r\nadvertising the convention. Keener interest throughout the State,\r\ntogether with the existence of fourteen leagues, represented the net\r\nresult of this first year's work. The officers were re-elected except\r\nthat Mrs. Palmer Jerman of Raleigh was made recording secretary and\r\nMiss Mary Shuford of Hickory corresponding secretary. Delegates\r\nappointed to the national convention at Nashville, Tenn., were: Misses\r\nBynum, Liddell and Mary Henderson.\r\n\r\nThe second annual convention met at the Battery Park Hotel, Asheville,\r\nOct. 29, 1915. Mrs. Nellie Nugent Somerville of Mississippi, a\r\nvice-president of the National Association, gave an address. During\r\nthe year Mrs. Desha Breckinridge of Kentucky, also a national\r\nvice-president, spoke several times in the State. Mrs. Henderson had\r\nsent a vigorous protest in the name of the league to Miss Alice Paul,\r\nchairman of the Congressional Union, against her coming into North\r\nCarolina to organize branches, saying that its policy was\r\ndiametrically opposed to that of the State Suffrage League, whose\r\narduous work of the past year would be undone. The outstanding feature\r\nof the year's work was the special hearing in the Legislature on the\r\nAct to Amend the Constitution so as to Give Woman Suffrage. In\r\nNovember, 1914, the legislators had been polled on the suffrage\r\nquestion, A few did not answer; fifteen were flatly opposed; twelve\r\nwere in favor; the majority declared themselves open to argument. At\r\nthe hearing held in the hall of the House with a large audience\r\npresent Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, president of the National Association,\r\nwas the chief speaker. Others included Mrs. Henderson, Mrs. Reilley,\r\nMrs. Adelaide Goodno, president of the Woman's Christian Temperance\r\nUnion; Mrs. Al Fairbrother and Mrs. Thomas W. Lingle. Miss Henderson,\r\nLegislative Committee chairman, presided. The measure was defeated.\r\nThe committee recommended that future efforts be concentrated on\r\nPresidential and Municipal suffrage bills. Mrs. Charlotte Malcolm of\r\nAsheville was elected president.[135]\r\n\r\nThere was no convention in 1916 but two were held in 1917. The first\r\nmet in the auditorium of the Carnegie Library, Greensboro, Jan. 12,\r\n13. Mrs. Walter McNab Miller, first vice-president of the National\r\nAssociation, was the principal speaker, addressing a mass meeting of\r\nrepresentative people in the Opera House. Mrs. J. S. Cunningham was\r\nelected president. During 1916 Mrs. Pattie Ruffner Jacobs of Alabama\r\nmade addresses in the State and Miss Gertrude Watkins and Miss Stokes,\r\nnational organizers, assisted in forming clubs.\r\n\r\nThe second convention for 1917 met in the Wayne county Court House,\r\nGoldsboro, Oct. 30, 31, Mrs. Cunningham presiding and speaking.\r\nColonel Joseph E. Robinson and J. F. Barrett made addresses. The\r\nprincipal speaker was Mrs. Jacobs, then auditor of the National\r\nAssociation. A fine collection of suffrage literature was presented\r\nfrom Chief Justice Clark. During the year Mrs. Miller had spoken\r\nseveral times in the State and delivered the commencement address at\r\nthe North Carolina College for Women. Mrs. Jerman cautioned the\r\nvarious leagues against affiliation with the Congressional Union, now\r\ncalled the Woman's Party, whose representatives were then at work in\r\nthe State. Mrs. Cunningham was re-elected president.\r\n\r\nAt the annual convention in the Woman's Club Building, Raleigh, Jan.\r\n10, 1919, Miss Gertrude Weil was elected president and Mrs. Josephus\r\nDaniels honorary president. The chief speaker was the Hon. William\r\nJennings Bryan, who addressed in the city auditorium an immense\r\ngathering of all classes. The past year had been a busy one. On April\r\n9, 1918, the State Republican convention included a suffrage plank in\r\nits platform. On the 10th representative suffragists appeared at the\r\nDemocratic State convention urging one but the plea fell upon dull\r\nears and unresponsive hearts. The latter part of May the State\r\nFederation of Women's Clubs with 8,000 members endorsed equal suffrage\r\nwith but two dissenting votes. In June the State Trained Nurses\r\nAssociation unanimously endorsed it. During September petitions signed\r\nby hundreds of college students and letters and telegrams representing\r\nhundreds of individuals were dispatched to U. S. Senators Simmons and\r\nOverman in Washington urging them to vote for the Federal Suffrage\r\nAmendment. On the petition from one college the names represented 107\r\ncities and towns in the State. The one from the State Normal College\r\ncarried the signatures of 576 out of the 650 women students. The\r\npetition of citizens from Raleigh bore the names of two daughters of\r\nSenator Simmons. The Senators were not moved. In all that memorable\r\nstruggle only one North Carolina Representative, Zebulon Weaver, a\r\nDemocrat of Asheville, voted \"aye.\" Edwin C. Webb of Cleveland county,\r\nas chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, was a powerful foe.\r\n\r\nAttempts were made to form suffrage leagues in different women's\r\ncolleges, where the students were eager to be organized, but in no\r\ncase would the trustees permit it. In November the State League\r\ntelegraphed President Wilson urging the appointment of Mrs. Carrie\r\nChapman Catt, national president, on the Peace Commission. In December\r\nthe Farmers' Union, representing 17,000 farmers, endorsed equal\r\nsuffrage. During the year the cause was advanced by the addresses of\r\nDr. Shaw and Miss Jeannette Rankin, the first woman Representative in\r\nCongress. At this time the State League carried on its letterhead an\r\nAdvisory Committee of Men such as never had been formed in any other\r\nState. The list of ninety-six names included Secretary of the Navy\r\nJosephus Daniels, Mr. Bryan, Chief Justice Clark, the most eminent\r\nmembers of the legal, medical and clerical professions, public\r\nofficials and business men.\r\n\r\nThe annual convention met in the O. Henry Hotel, Greensboro, Jan. 27,\r\n28, 1920, Miss Weil presiding. A brilliant banquet was attended by a\r\nlarge number of representative men and women. The honorary president,\r\nMrs. Daniels, made a brief speech and Miss Marjorie Shuler, national\r\ndirector of publicity, was a speaker. Mrs. Raymond Brown,\r\nvice-president of the National Association, and Miss Shuler addressed\r\nthe convention and the public meeting in the evening, over which Mrs.\r\nDaniels presided. Twenty-four leagues were reported, largely the fruit\r\nof the organization work done during the year by Mrs. Mary O. Cowper\r\nof Durham, who had the assistance of Miss Mary E. Pidgeon, a national\r\norganizer. During the year a series of related suffrage papers were\r\nprepared by members of the Greensboro league and distributed by the\r\nState league among the different branches. Miss Weil was continued as\r\npresident. Reports of all committees and of the work in general\r\nthroughout the State, were so encouraging that Miss Shuler frequently\r\nvoiced the common feeling, \"North Carolina will ratify.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the North Carolina women who have made addresses for suffrage in\r\nthe State are: Dr. Delia Dixon-Carroll, Miss Louise Alexander, Miss\r\nClara B. Byrd, Mrs. Cunningham, Miss Harriet Elliott, Mrs.\r\nFairbrother, Mrs. Henderson, Mrs. Jerman, Mrs. Lingle, Mrs. T. D.\r\nJones, Mrs. Platt, Miss Weil.\r\n\r\nWhen the State Equal Suffrage League was organized in 1913 many of the\r\nnewspapers refused to carry stories about it or assist in advertising\r\nit in any way. Gradually, however, they have been won over almost\r\nwithout exception, not only to the publishing of news but many of the\r\nmost influential papers contained during 1920 convincing editorials in\r\nbehalf of equal suffrage, so that the women who are working for it\r\nregard the newspapers as among their strongest allies. Special mention\r\nshould be made of the vigorous support of ratification of the Federal\r\nSuffrage Amendment by the Raleigh _News and Observer_, the Greensboro\r\n_Daily News_ and the Charlotte _Observer_.\r\n\r\nThe workers are greatly indebted to Chief Justice Clark, who for years\r\nhas been an unfailing champion of equal suffrage and real democracy.\r\nDeep indebtedness is acknowledged to Dr. Shaw, who a number of times\r\ncame to speak and whose memory is held in deep affection by North\r\nCarolina suffragists. Her last visit was made when she gave the\r\ncommencement address at the College for Women at Greensboro in May,\r\n1919, wearing the medal for distinguished service given by Secretary\r\nof War Baker the preceding day. A few years ago a beautiful residence\r\nfor the women students was erected on the college grounds. She had\r\nspoken several times to the students, who were devoted to her, and\r\nafter her death on July 2 the alumnæ officially requested that the\r\nresidence be named the Anna Howard Shaw building, which was done.[136]\r\n\r\nOn Oct. 7, 1920, after the Federal Amendment had been proclaimed, the\r\nState League held its last meeting and was merged into the League of\r\nWomen Voters, with Miss Gertrude Weil chairman. Mrs. Maud Wood Park,\r\nchairman of the National League, addressed a large and appreciative\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. The Legislature of 1919 had instructed Governor Thomas\r\nW. Bickett to call a special session in 1920 to consider matters\r\nconnected with taxation and it was understood that the ratification of\r\nthe Federal Woman Suffrage Amendment would be considered at that time.\r\nBy March, 1920, it had been ratified by 35 States and it was evident\r\nthat North Carolina might be the one to give the final affirmative\r\nvote. This did not seem impossible, as the most prominent men in the\r\nState were favorable, including the Lieutenant Governor, the Speaker\r\nof the House, several members of Congress, the Secretary of State and\r\nother officials; the presidents of most of the colleges and of various\r\norganizations; Judges, Mayors and many others. The Republican State\r\nconvention in March seated two women delegates for the first time and\r\nput a woman on the ticket for State Superintendent of Public\r\nInstruction, Mrs. Mary Settle Sharpe of the North Carolina College for\r\nWomen, who was on two State Republican Committees. The Democrats at\r\ntheir State convention, April 8, seated about forty women delegates.\r\nBefore the convention U. S. Senator Simmons, always a strong opponent\r\nof woman suffrage, announced himself in favor of ratification on the\r\nground of political expediency. Governor Bickett issued a similar\r\nstatement and A. W. McLean, member of the Democratic National\r\nCommittee, declared publicly for it. Clyde Hoey, member of Congress,\r\ntemporary chairman of the convention, made the key-note speech in\r\nregard to State issues, in which he said: \"I hope to see our General\r\nAssembly at its special session ratify the Federal Suffrage Amendment.\r\nThere is no one thing you can do here that will be worth so much to\r\nthe party in the nation as to recommend to the Legislature the\r\nratification of this amendment.\" It was supposed that U. S. Senator\r\nOverman would fall in line but in his speech he said: \"I have been and\r\nstill am opposed to woman suffrage. It is fundamental with me, deep\r\nand inborn ... but I recognize the fact that it seems inevitable.\"\r\n\r\nThe plank in the platform, as it came from the committee, recommended\r\nthat the amendment should not be ratified but a State amendment should\r\nbe submitted to the voters. A minority report called for the\r\nsubmission to the convention of the question whether the platform\r\nshould contain a plank for ratification. A second minority report was\r\noffered to eliminate all reference to woman suffrage. Never in the\r\nhistory of the party was there such a fight over the platform. Colonel\r\nA. D. Watts and Cameron Morrison led the opposition to ratification;\r\nW. P. Glidewell and John D. Bellamy the affirmative. Finally F. P.\r\nHobgood, Jr., one of the earliest champions of woman suffrage, after a\r\nfiery speech, presented the following substitute for all the reports:\r\n\"This convention recommends to the Democratic members of the General\r\nAssembly that at the approaching special session they vote in favor of\r\nthe ratification of the proposed 19th Amendment to the Federal\r\nConstitution.\" This was carried by a vote of 585 to 428. Mrs. John S.\r\nCunningham, former president of the State Equal Suffrage League, was\r\nelected by a large majority as honorary delegate to the Democratic\r\nNational convention and Miss Mary O. Graham as delegate. She had\r\nalready been made a member of the National Committee.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the country was focussed on North Carolina. In the\r\nearly summer President Wilson telegraphed to Governor Bickett: \"I need\r\nnot point out to you the critical importance of the action of your\r\ngreat State in the matter of the suffrage amendment.\" The Governor\r\nreplied in part: \"I hope the Tennessee Legislature will meet and\r\nratify the amendment and thus make immediate action by North Carolina\r\nunnecessary. We have neither the time nor the money and such action on\r\nthe part of Tennessee would save this State the feeling of bitterness\r\nthat would surely be engendered by debate on the subject that would\r\ncome up in the Legislature. I have said all I intend to say on the\r\nsubject of ratification. While I will take my medicine I will never\r\nswear that it tastes good, for it doesn't.\"\r\n\r\nJust before the assembling of the Legislature suffrage headquarters\r\nwere opened in Raleigh with Miss Gertrude Weil, president of the State\r\nEqual Suffrage League, and Mrs. Palmer Jerman, chairman of its\r\nlegislative committee, in charge. Miss Engle and Miss Pidgeon,\r\nnational organizers, were also members of the headquarters group. Miss\r\nMartha Haywood did invaluable work as publicity chairman. A booth with\r\nliterature, posters, etc., was established in the Yarborough Hotel.\r\n\r\nAmong the prominent men who during the struggle for ratification\r\nstrongly urged it were: Secretary Daniels, Gen. Julian S. Carr; Col.\r\nWade Harris, editor of the Charlotte _Observer_; J. W. Bailey,\r\ncollector of Internal Revenue; Clyde R. Hoey, member of Congress; Max\r\nO. Gardner, Lieutenant Governor; J. C. Pritchard, Judge of the U. S.\r\nCircuit Court of Appeals; Dennis G. Brummitt, Speaker of the House;\r\nex-Governor Locke Craig, A. W. McAlister and many others. Senator\r\nSimmons, who was asked to come to Raleigh to assist in the fight,\r\nrefused to do so but issued another statement that, although he had\r\nalways been opposed to suffrage and his position was unchanged, he\r\nrealized that its coming was inevitable and believed that it would\r\nhelp the Democratic party to ratify. Later, in response to a request\r\nfrom the Raleigh _News and Observer_, he stressed the point that,\r\nsince the rest of the country was practically unanimous for\r\nratification, he feared sectional antagonism might be aroused if North\r\nCarolina did not ratify. Mr. Bryan sent a message urging\r\nratification. Mrs. Daniels came to Raleigh to assist personally in the\r\nstruggle to ratify.\r\n\r\nOn August 10 the session convened. The outlook was encouraging but the\r\nenemies had been busy and the very next day a \"round robin\" signed by\r\n63 members of the House was sent to the General Assembly of Tennessee,\r\nwhere a bitter fight on ratification was in progress, which said: \"We,\r\nthe undersigned, members of the House of Representatives of the\r\nGeneral Assembly of North Carolina, constituting the majority of said\r\nbody, send greetings and assure you that we will not ratify the Susan\r\nB. Anthony amendment interfering with the sovereignty of Tennessee and\r\nother States of the Union. We most respectfully request that this\r\nmeasure be not forced upon the people of North Carolina.\"\r\n\r\nOn August 13 the Governor, accompanied by Mrs. Bickett, Mrs. Daniels\r\nand Mrs. Jerman, appeared in person before the joint assembly in the\r\nhall of the House of Representatives, where the gallery was crowded\r\nwith women, and began his address by saying: \"From reports in the\r\npublic press it seems that sentiment in the General Assembly is\r\ndecidedly against the ratification of the amendment. With this\r\nsentiment I am in deepest sympathy and for the gentlemen who entertain\r\nit I cherish the profoundest respect but this does not lessen my\r\nobligation to lay before you a photographic copy of my mind on this\r\nimportant subject. It is well known that I have never been impressed\r\nwith the wisdom of or the necessity for woman suffrage in North\r\nCarolina.\" After a long speech setting forth the arguments in\r\nopposition and quoting poetry he said: \"But in the words of Grover\r\nCleveland, a condition not a theory confronts us. Woman suffrage is at\r\nhand. It is an absolute moral certainty that inside of six months some\r\nState will open the door and women will enter the political forum. No\r\ngreat movement in all history has ever gone so near the top and then\r\nfailed to go over. The very most this General Assembly can do is to\r\ndelay for six months a movement it is powerless to defeat. I am\r\nprofoundly convinced that it would be the part of wisdom and grace to\r\naccept the inevitable and ratify the amendment.\"\r\n\r\nOn the same day Senator Scales introduced the resolution to ratify,\r\nwhich was referred to the Committee on Constitutional Amendments.\r\nWithin a quarter of an hour the committee reported favorably by 7 to\r\n1--Senator Cloud. This prompt action was said to be not a tribute to\r\nGovernor Bickett but to Lieutenant Governor Gardner. It was introduced\r\ninto the House by minority leader H. S. Williams (Republican) and\r\nreferred to the Committee on Constitutional Amendments.\r\n\r\nSenator Scales, floor leader in the Senate for ratification, and\r\nSenator Lindsay Warren, floor leader for the opposition, agreed that\r\nthe resolution to ratify should come up for discussion August 17. So\r\ngreat was the excitement that by order of the Senate the gallery space\r\nwas divided, the east wing being assigned to the ratificationists, the\r\nwest wing to the rejectionists. An impassioned debate continued about\r\nfive hours, Senator Carr opening for ratification, followed by\r\nSenators Sisk, Long of Halifax, Lovell and Glidewell, with Scales\r\nclosing. The opposition was led by Senator Warren, followed by\r\nSenators Beddingfield, Thompson and Conner. When agreement to vote was\r\nreached and the prospect for ratification was favorable, Senator\r\nWarren suddenly interposed a resolution to defer action until the\r\nregular meeting of the Legislature in 1921. Senator Scales had no\r\nintimation that this move would be made until it was too late to\r\nprevent it and the vote stood 25 ayes, 23 noes. Blame for the defeat\r\nwas placed to a large extent upon Senator Stacy. Had he remained true,\r\nthere would have been a tie and the Lieutenant Governor would have\r\nvoted in favor.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile it was generally understood that Representative W. W. Neal\r\nhad been sent to Tennessee for a conference with the opponents in the\r\nLegislature there to arrange for the defeat of ratification by the\r\nHouse in each State. Speaker Seth Walker of the Tennessee House\r\ntelegraphed Speaker Brummitt: \"Have the amendment defeated\r\noverwhelmingly in the Lower House. We are proud of our mother State of\r\nNorth Carolina. God grant that she stand true to her glorious\r\ntradition and history.\" All kinds of canards were in circulation and\r\nGovernor James M. Cox, Democratic candidate for President, had to send\r\na personal telegram denying that he was opposed to the ratification.\r\nA Rejection League of Women had been formed with Miss Mary Hilliard\r\nHinton as chairman, which was very active.\r\n\r\nAugust 16 a resolution to reject was introduced in the House by\r\nRepresentative Grier. After the unexpected action of the Senate\r\ninterest abated in the House. The question was taken up on the 19th\r\nand the resolution to ratify was considered first. Representative\r\nEverett led the ratification forces with Representative Gold and\r\nothers giving strong support. Representatives Crisp and Dawson led the\r\nopponents. The vote stood 41 ayes, 71 noes. The rejection resolution\r\nwas laid on the table.\r\n\r\nIn her report on ratification Mrs. Jerman made the significant\r\nstatement that, although individual men in both parties had stood true\r\nto their pledges as loyal supporters, yet both parties had repudiated\r\ntheir State platforms, and, therefore, the women were free so far as\r\nany feeling of allegiance to either for what it may have done for\r\nsuffrage was concerned.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. 1897.

The auditorium was hung with huge\r\nbanners reading, \"Equality at the Ballot Box,\" \"Taxation Without\r\nRepresentation is Tyranny,\" etc. Dr. Cora Smith Eaton addressed a\r\nlarge audience on The Status of Woman Suffrage in our Country.\r\nOfficers elected were, Mrs. Flora B. Naylor, president; Mrs. Janette\r\nHill Knox, vice-president; Mrs. Mazie Stevens, treasurer; Mrs.\r\nKatharine F. King, recording secretary.\r\n\r\nFrom 1901 to 1912 there are no records of an active suffrage\r\norganization but individuals and small groups of women in different\r\nparts of the State kept alive the suffrage spirit. On Feb. 4, 1912,\r\ntwenty-four men and women were invited to meet Miss Sylvia Pankhurst\r\nof England at the home of Mrs. Mary Darrow Weible in Fargo. After an\r\ninformal discussion the Votes for Women League of Fargo was organized\r\nwith Mrs. Clara L. Darrow president. A strong league was organized in\r\nGrand Forks by Mrs. R. M. Pollock. On June 13, at the call of the\r\nFargo League, an earnest group of men and women from different parts\r\nof the State met at the Public Library and formed a State Votes for\r\nWomen League. Officers: President, Mrs. Darrow; vice-president at\r\nlarge, Mrs. M. L. Ayers, Dickinson; corresponding secretary, Mrs.\r\nAlice Nelson Page, Grand Forks; recording secretary, Mrs. Kate Selby\r\nWilder, Fargo; treasurer, Mrs. Helen de Lendrecie, Fargo; Committee on\r\nPermanent Organization, Mrs. Ayers, Mrs. James Collins, Mrs. W. J.\r\nHolbrook, N. C. McDonald, W. L. Stockwell; Resolutions, Mrs. Page,\r\nMrs. Wilder, Mrs. W. F. Cushing; Constitution, Miss Candis Nelson,\r\nMr. McDonald; Promotion, Mrs. C. F. Amidon. Steps were taken to\r\naffiliate with the National American Woman Suffrage Association and it\r\nwas decided to introduce a resolution for the submission of a State\r\nsuffrage amendment to the voters at the next session of the\r\nLegislature. Mrs. de Lendrecie gave headquarters in the de Lendrecie\r\nBuilding at Fargo.\r\n\r\nThe first convention was held at the Civic Center, Fargo, Oct. 18,\r\n1913. The Promotions Committee reported the circularization of the\r\nentire press and the legislators and a number of towns organized. A\r\nwoman suffrage bill had been passed by the Legislature and would be\r\nsubmitted to the voters on Nov. 4, 1914. With the following State\r\nofficers the campaign was launched: Mrs. Darrow, president; Mrs.\r\nWeible, vice-president; Mrs. Emma S. Pierce, treasurer; Mrs. Francis\r\nS. Bolley, congressional chairman; Mrs. Elizabeth Darrow O'Neil,\r\ncampaign manager.\r\n\r\nA plan to divide the State into its judicial districts with district,\r\ncounty and township chairmen was only partially carried out. One\r\nhundred leagues were formed with approximately 2,000 members. Wherever\r\nthere was an efficient worker she was given a free hand to get the\r\nvotes in her locality in the most effective way. From four to six\r\norganizers were in the field continually; seven speakers, including\r\nDr. Anna Howard Shaw, its president, were sent by the National\r\nAssociation and five were furnished by the State. Chautauquas, fairs,\r\ntheaters and all kinds of meetings were everywhere utilized and there\r\nwere automobile speaking tours to outlying districts; plate matter was\r\nfurnished to the press and political party members were circularized.\r\nA fund of $6,000 was raised, $3,000 of which came from the National\r\nAssociation and other outside sources.\r\n\r\nIt was a hard and hopeless campaign because of an impossible\r\nrequirement. When the framers of the constitution for statehood in\r\n1889 refused to include woman suffrage a provision was put in the\r\nconstitution whereby the Legislature at any time could submit a bill\r\nfor it at the next general election. If approved by a majority of\r\nvoters \"voting upon the question\" it became a Law. How, when or where\r\nthe words \"voting at the election\" were substituted for \"voting upon\r\nthe question\" no one seemed to know but they got into the\r\nconstitution. They meant that the suffrage referendum must poll a\r\nmajority of all the votes cast at the election and not just on the\r\nmeasure itself. If the ballot was not marked at all it was counted in\r\nthe negative. The official returns gave the affirmative vote on\r\nsuffrage 40,209; blanks and noes together 49,348, making a total of\r\n89,557, or 251 more votes than were cast for Governor, who polled the\r\nlargest number. It was generally conceded that if the unmarked ballots\r\nhad not been counted against the measure it would have been carried.\r\nThe entire western part of the State went for suffrage. The chief\r\nopponents were the German Russians in Emmons and surrounding counties\r\nand a handful of anti-suffragists who came from outside the State.\r\n\r\nThe same Legislature that sent this bill to the electors also\r\nsubmitted a woman suffrage amendment to the State constitution, which\r\nwould be more secure than a law. This resolution had to pass two\r\nLegislatures but it required only a majority at the polls of the votes\r\nactually cast on the question. The suffragists felt sure that the\r\nLegislature of 1915 would pass for the second time this resolution for\r\nan amendment but it refused to do so. They soon sustained a great loss\r\nin the death of Mrs. Darrow, the much loved president, on April 23,\r\n1915. She had sacrificed her life in her ceaseless work for woman\r\nsuffrage. Her husband, Dr. E. M. Darrow, a pioneer physician, two\r\ndaughters and three sons ardently supported her efforts.\r\n\r\nOn account of the campaign the convention of 1914 had been postponed.\r\nIt was held at Valley City in June, 1915, and Mrs. Grace Clendening of\r\nWimbledon was elected president. Undaunted the suffragists made plans\r\nto hold together the converts won during the campaign. The\r\norganization had been of mushroom growth and they now had to\r\nstrengthen it.\r\n\r\nThe annual convention was held at Minot Oct. 10, 1915, and Mrs.\r\nClendening was re-elected. Extensive educational work was done the\r\nfollowing year, at Chautauquas by holding \"suffrage days,\" and through\r\nbooths maintained at the Fargo and Grand Forks fairs, with a wide\r\ndistribution of literature. The Votes for Women League and the Woman's\r\nChristian Temperance Union opposed Governor Hanna and Lieutenant\r\nGovernor Fraine at the June primaries because they were responsible\r\nfor the unfair treatment of the suffrage resolution in the Legislature\r\nand both were defeated.\r\n\r\nThe annual convention was held Oct. 13, 1916, at Valley City, the\r\nNational Association sending as a representative its first\r\nvice-president, Mrs. Walter McNab Miller of Missouri. It was planned\r\nto organize the State on the lines of its three Congressional\r\ndistricts, which made a smaller executive board and facilitated its\r\nmeetings. The following officers were elected: President, Mrs.\r\nClendening; treasurer and press chairman, Mrs. Pierce; national and\r\nfirst congressional district chairman, Mrs. O'Neil; educational and\r\nsecond district chairman, Mrs. Charles Rathman; third district\r\nchairman, Mrs. Emma Murray; legislative chairman, Mrs. Weible;\r\npublicity chairman, Miss Aldyth Ward. An active campaign was started\r\nto influence legislators for a Presidential and Municipal suffrage\r\nbill and a constitutional amendment. The National Association sent two\r\norganizers to tour the State, arouse interest and raise money. In\r\nFebruary, 1917, one-fifth of the newspapers of the State, representing\r\nfour-fifths of the counties, published suffrage editions, and in May a\r\n60-page suffrage edition of a Labor magazine was edited and 5,000\r\ncopies distributed. In April the headquarters were largely used for\r\nwar work.\r\n\r\nThe annual convention was held at Bismarck Sept. 25-26, 1917. The\r\nPresidential and Municipal suffrage bills having passed both Houses\r\nand become law the convention decided to concentrate on the Federal\r\nSuffrage Amendment. An emergency executive committee of Fargo women\r\nwas elected to cooperate from the State headquarters without delay in\r\ncarrying out instructions from the National Association. The following\r\nresolution was adopted: \"The North Dakota Votes for Women League,\r\nreaffirming its steadfast loyalty and support to our President and our\r\nGovernment, will continue to carry on the patriotic work assigned us\r\nby the Government through our National Association, and will redouble\r\nour efforts to gain enfranchisement for the women of the United States\r\nin order that we may do more effective war work.\" Mrs. Clendening, who\r\nwas State president from 1915 to 1920, was now also vice-president of\r\nthe State Committee of the Woman's Division of the National Council of\r\nDefense.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. From the time the convention for statehood failed\r\nto put equal suffrage into the constitution the Women's Christian\r\nTemperance Union kept up the agitation for it. In every Legislature a\r\nsuffrage bill was introduced and its president, Mrs. Elizabeth Preston\r\nAnderson, attended each session. Although working separately, Mrs.\r\nAnderson and the suffrage legislative committees were always in\r\nperfect harmony. In 1911 the Union had a resolution introduced to\r\nsubmit a woman suffrage amendment to the State constitution. Mrs.\r\nDarrow and Mrs. de Lendrecie of the State Suffrage League lobbied for\r\nit. It was lost in the Senate by 23 to 25 votes; referred to the\r\nCommittee on Woman Suffrage in the House, which recommended indefinite\r\npostponement and the report was accepted by 54 ayes, 42 noes.\r\n\r\n1913. The Legislative Committee consisted of Mrs. Darrow, Mrs. Fannie\r\nD. Quain, Mrs. Ella C. Boise and Miss Ward. Two suffrage measures\r\ndrawn up by Senator R. M. Pollock passed both Houses. The resolution\r\nfor an amendment to the State constitution, which would have to pass\r\ntwo consecutive Legislatures before submission to the voters, received\r\nin the Senate 31 ayes, 19 noes; in the House 79 ayes, 29 noes; 5\r\nabsent. A legislative bill, which would go to the voters at the next\r\nelection, received in the Senate, 27 ayes, 22 noes; 1 absent; in the\r\nHouse, 104 ayes; 1 no. Another bill introduced at this same session,\r\nproviding that the question be submitted to a vote of the women, was\r\npassed in the Senate by 41 to 9 and indefinitely postponed in the\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n1915. Legislative Committee Mrs. Darrow, Mrs. Quain and Mrs. Weible.\r\nIt is a significant fact that of the nearly 800 bills introduced every\r\none had honest treatment, passed or failed to pass on roll call or was\r\nindefinitely postponed by vote, except the one which vitally affected\r\nthe women. The concurrent resolution for a woman suffrage amendment,\r\nwhich had passed the Legislature of 1913 and had to be ratified by\r\nthat of 1915, was passed in the Senate on February 13 by 31 ayes, 15\r\nnoes, more than two to one, and the so-called \"clincher\" applied to it\r\nwhich prevented its reconsideration by less than a two-thirds vote.\r\nThe House had appeared more favorable than the Senate and it seemed\r\ncertain that it would pass that body. On February 18, five days after\r\nthe measure had passed the Senate, Senator Jacobson moved that it be\r\nrecalled from the House, where it had had its first and second\r\nreadings and been referred to the Committee on Elections. This motion\r\nwas carried by 26 to 22. The opponents at once gathered their forces.\r\nJudge N. C. Young of Fargo, attorney for the Northern Pacific Railway,\r\nand Mrs. Young, president of the State Anti-Suffrage Association,\r\narrived immediately and began lobbying, Judge Young even appearing on\r\nthe floor of the Senate chamber.[138] The German vote was promised to\r\nambitious politicians and a desired change of the county seat was\r\noffered. The Senate not having the necessary two-thirds to kill the\r\nresolution refused by a majority vote to take action upon it. It\r\nshould then have gone automatically back to the House but the\r\npresident of the Senate, Lieutenant Governor Fraine, withheld it until\r\nthe Legislature adjourned. The chief opponents during these years were\r\nthe old Republican \"stand-patters,\" who controlled the political\r\n\"machine,\" and Judge Young was one of the most prominent. Success came\r\nwith its overthrow.\r\n\r\n1917. The Legislative Committee consisted of Mrs. Clendening and Mrs.\r\nWeible. On January 14 Senator Oscar Lindstrom introduced a\r\nPresidential and Municipal suffrage bill, written by Senator Pollock\r\nat Mrs. Anderson's request. It was modelled on the Illinois bill and\r\nbeginning with July 1 it entitled women to vote for Presidential\r\nelectors, county surveyors and constables and for all officers of\r\ncities, villages and towns excepting police magistrates and city\r\njustices of the peace. A concurrent resolution providing for an\r\namendment to the State constitution to give full suffrage to women was\r\nalso introduced. Both were passed on January 16 by the same vote, 37\r\nayes, 11 noes in the Senate; 89 ayes, 19 noes in the House, and were\r\nthe first measures signed by Governor Lynn J. Frazier, on the 23rd.\r\n\r\nThis Legislature and also the one of 1919 adopted a resolution calling\r\nupon Congress to submit the Federal Woman Suffrage Amendment. Four of\r\nthe five North Dakota members were then in favor of it and in 1918 the\r\nhesitating Senator made the delegation unanimous.\r\n\r\nThe State Referendum Association and the Anti-Suffrage Association\r\nmade an attempt to secure a petition for a referendum to the voters of\r\nthe Presidential and Municipal suffrage bill, but although less than\r\n11,000 names were required only a few thousand were filed with the\r\nSecretary of State and there was considerable difficulty in securing\r\nthose. Affidavits were sent to the Suffrage Association proving that\r\nmany names were obtained by fraud.\r\n\r\n1919. The Legislature passed the concurrent resolution providing for\r\nan amendment to the constitution giving women full suffrage, which had\r\ngone through that of 1917. The vote in the Senate was 43 ayes, 1 no,\r\nwith 5 absent; in the House 98 ayes, no negative, with 15 absent. It\r\nwas to be voted on Nov. 2, 1920. Before that date the Federal\r\nAmendment had been submitted by Congress and ratified by thirty-seven\r\nLegislatures.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. The Legislature met in special session Dec. 2, 1919, and\r\nratified by the following vote: Senate, 41 ayes, 4 noes with 3 absent;\r\nHouse 102 ayes, 6 noes. Nevertheless the vote on the State amendment\r\nhad to be taken on Nov. 2, 1920, and it stood: Ayes, 129,628; noes,\r\n68,569. Thousands of women voted at this election.\r\n\r\nOn April 1, 1920, the State Votes for Women League met and was\r\nre-organized as the League of Women Voters, with Mrs. Kate S. Wilder\r\nof Fargo chairman.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[137] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Emma S. Pierce,\r\nvice-president of the State Votes for Women League.\r\n\r\n[138] A field worker for a philanthropic organization, who had a room\r\nin a hotel in Bismarck, the capital, next to one occupied by the\r\nrepresentative of the liquor interests, heard him send a long distance\r\ntelephone message to Mrs. Young for her and the Judge to come on the\r\nfirst train, as they were needed. She heard another one say: \"If the\r\nd----n women get the ballot there will be no chance of re-submitting\r\nthe prohibition amendment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nOHIO.[139]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of woman suffrage in Ohio is a long one, for the second\r\nwoman's rights convention ever held took place at Salem, in April,\r\n1850, and the work never entirely ceased. Looking back over it since\r\n1900, when the Ohio chapter for Volume IV ended, one is conscious of\r\nthe wonderful spirit manifested in the State association. Other States\r\ndid more spectacular work and had larger organizations but none\r\nfinished its tasks with a stronger spirit of loyalty and love for the\r\nwork and the workers.\r\n\r\nThe State Woman Suffrage Association was organized in 1885 and held\r\nannual conventions for the next thirty-five years, at which capable\r\nofficers were elected who were consecrated to their duties. From 1899\r\nto 1920 Mrs. Harriet Taylor Upton was president, with the exception of\r\nthe three years 1908-1911, when the office was filled by Mrs. Pauline\r\nSteinem of Toledo. During the first twenty years of the present\r\ncentury but one year, that of 1911, passed without a State\r\nconvention.[140] For over twenty years the State headquarters were in\r\nWarren, the home of Mrs. Upton.\r\n\r\nOn May 4, 5, 1920, the final convention of the Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation was held in Columbus and with its work finished the State\r\nLeague of Women Voters was organized, with Miss Amy G. Maher as\r\nchairman.\r\n\r\nThe devotion, the efficiency, the self-sacrifice of the suffrage\r\nworkers in Ohio will never be known. Their strength lay in their\r\ncooperation. To give their names and their work would fill all the\r\nspace allowed for this chapter but one exception should in justice be\r\nmade. Elizabeth J. Hauser from her childhood days until the Federal\r\nAmendment was ratified gave her life to woman's enfranchisement.\r\nPainstaking, fearless, unselfish and able, she labored cheerfully, not\r\ncaring for praise or credit for the things she accomplished. A good\r\nexecutive, organizer, legislative worker, speaker and writer, she was\r\na power in the counsels of the suffragists. To her more than to any\r\nother woman do Ohio women owe a debt of gratitude.[141]\r\n\r\nFrom the first gathering of Ohio suffragists in 1850 until Tennessee\r\nspoke the last word in 1920, few years passed when some suffrage\r\nmeasure was not asked for and few Legislatures went out of existence\r\nwithout having considered some legislation referring to women. In 1894\r\na law gave them the right to vote for members of the boards of\r\neducation. In 1904 and 1905, the Legislature was asked to submit to\r\nthe voters an amendment to the State constitution giving full suffrage\r\nto women but the resolution was not reported out of the committees. In\r\n1908 it was reported but no vote was taken. In 1910 it was defeated on\r\nthe floor. This was the experience for years.\r\n\r\nPeriodically attempts had been made to revise the State constitution\r\nof 1851 without success but the Legislature of 1910 provided for\r\nsubmitting to the voters the question of calling a convention, which\r\nwas carried in the fall of that year. The convention was to be\r\nnon-partisan. The suffragists interviewed the delegates on putting\r\nwoman suffrage in the new constitution and the poll was complete when\r\nthe convention opened. The moment the president was chosen, the\r\nsuffrage leaders asked for a friendly committee and from that time to\r\nthe very last moment they were at work. The proposition for a woman\r\nsuffrage clause was introduced Jan. 22, 1912; a pro-hearing was held\r\nFebruary 8; an anti-hearing followed by a public meeting was had\r\nFebruary 14 and the following day it was favorably reported out of\r\ncommittee by a vote of 20 to 1.\r\n\r\nInterests, vicious and commercial, fought the suffrage amendment from\r\nevery possible angle but on March 7 the convention adopted it by a\r\nvote of 76 to 34. If accepted by the voters it would eliminate the\r\nwords \"white male\" from Section 1, Article V, of the present\r\nconstitution. The enemies secured the submission of a separate\r\namendment eliminating the word \"white.\" This was done to alienate the\r\nnegro vote from the suffrage amendment and the negroes were told that\r\nit was a shame they should be \"tied to the women's apron strings.\"\r\n\r\nThe new constitution was made by adding amendments to the old one and\r\nthe suffrage amendment went in with the rest. William B. Kirkpatrick,\r\nchairman of the Equal Suffrage Committee of the convention, more than\r\nany one was responsible for the acceptance of the amendment. Through\r\nthe whole convention he fought for it, sacrificing many things near\r\nhis heart--they could wait, this was the chance for woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe amendment was numbered \"23\" and at that time this number was\r\nconsidered unlucky. The most illiterate could remember to vote against\r\nthat \"23.\" The constitution was ready on May 31 and the special\r\nelection was set for Sept. 3, 1912. Three months of vigorous campaign\r\nfor the amendment followed. The German-American Alliance and the\r\nPersonal Liberty League, two associations representing the brewers'\r\ninterests, fought it in the field as they had done in the convention.\r\nIt was estimated that the suffragists spent $40,000 and it was learned\r\nthat the liquor forces first appropriated $500,000 and later added\r\n$120,000 to defeat the suffrage amendment. The chief work of the\r\nsuffragists was done in the cities, although women spoke at picnics,\r\ncounty fairs, family reunions, circuses, beaches, institutes, labor\r\nmeetings, at country stores, school houses and cross roads. More than\r\nfifty workers came into Ohio from all directions to assist, the larger\r\nnumber from the eastern States. They received no financial recompense\r\nand gave splendid service. In August an impressive suffrage parade of\r\n5,000 took place in Columbus.\r\n\r\nThe president of the German-American Alliance at a meeting in\r\nYoungstown boasted openly that it defeated the amendment. It\r\nadvertised everywhere, by posters and in street cars, and had no\r\nvoluntary workers. It was evident that huge sums were being spent. The\r\namendment was lost by a majority of 87,455--ayes, 249,420; noes,\r\n336,875. Only 24 out of 88 counties were carried and but one\r\nCongressional district, the Eighteenth.\r\n\r\nThere was never any state-wide anti-suffrage association of women but\r\nonly small groups in Cleveland, Cincinnati, Dayton and Columbus. Most\r\nof them were rich, well situated, not familiar with organized reform\r\nwork and not knowing the viciousness of their associates. The real foe\r\nwas the associated liquor men, calling themselves at first the\r\nPersonal Liberty League, later the Home Rule Association, appearing\r\nunder different names in different campaigns and they had in their\r\nemploy a few women who were connected with the Anti-Suffrage\r\nAssociation. The amendment was lost in 1912 because of the activity of\r\nthe liquor interests and the indifference of the so-called good\r\npeople. More men voted on this question, pro and con, than had ever\r\nvoted on woman suffrage before in any State.\r\n\r\nThe amendment eliminating the word \"white,\" left over from ante bellum\r\ndays, also was defeated and the new constitution retained a clause\r\nwhich had been nullified by the 15th Amendment to the National\r\nConstitution forty years before! The initiative and referendum\r\namendment was carried. The State Suffrage Association, therefore,\r\nearly in 1913, decided to circulate a petition initiating a woman\r\nsuffrage amendment to the constitution, as there was no hope that the\r\nLegislature would submit one. It required the signatures of ten per\r\ncent. of the voters at the last election, in this instance 130,000\r\nnames. It was drawn by an Ohio member of Congress, received at State\r\nheadquarters April 15, submitted to the Attorney General and held many\r\nweeks. When returned, instructions were carefully followed. On\r\nSeptember 15 the first petition heads were received from the printer.\r\n\r\nIt was a new law and lawyers and laymen were uncertain about it. The\r\nquestion of the validity of the petitions if circulated by women was\r\nraised and a ruling was asked for. The Secretary of State decided that\r\nwomen could circulate them and the Attorney General agreed. It was\r\nfeared by some that the petition head was faulty because it did not\r\ncontain a repeal clause and after three weeks of anxious waiting the\r\nopinion was given that this was not necessary. Then arose another\r\npoint, that the names of the committee standing for the petition must\r\nbe on it. This constant objecting and obstructing led the suffrage\r\nleaders, upon advice of their attorney, to withdraw the petition and\r\nawait the action of the special session of the Legislature. It passed\r\nthe initiative and referendum safeguarding measure, which the Governor\r\nsigned Feb. 17, 1914, and all uncertainties seemed over.\r\n\r\nDetermined to have a perfect copy for the petition head the\r\nsuffragists had it prepared by the State Legislative Reference\r\nDepartment and the Secretary of State orally approved it. At the\r\nheadquarters it was noticed that the words, \"Be it resolved by the\r\npeople of Ohio,\" which the constitution specifically provided must be\r\non petition heads and which had been on the first one, had been\r\nomitted. They asked the Secretary of State whether this jeopardized\r\nthe petition and it was his opinion that it did, although he had\r\napproved it. The Attorney General finally gave it official sanction\r\nand the first petitions were put out in March, 1914, after one year's\r\ncontinuous effort to get them into circulation. Who but women fighting\r\nfor their freedom could ever have had the courage to keep on? They had\r\nno money to pay circulators and all was volunteer work. Over 2,000\r\nwomen circulated these petitions. To have more than 130,000 men write\r\ntheir names and addresses on a petition and the circulator see them do\r\nit and swear that she did was no light task but it was accomplished.\r\nOn July 30 petitions bearing 131,271 names were filed with the\r\nSecretary of State. A petition was secured in every county, although\r\nthe law requires them from a majority only, and each was presented by\r\na worker from that county. The sight of scores of men and women with\r\narms laden with petitions marching up to the State House to deposit\r\nthem brought tears to the eyes of some of the onlookers.\r\n\r\nThe campaign opened in Toledo, April 14, 15, was hectic. Everything\r\npossible was done to bring the amendment to the attention of the\r\nvoters. Cleveland suffragists put on a beautiful pageant, A Dream of\r\nFreedom. A pilgrimage was made to the Friends' Meeting House in Salem\r\nwhere the suffrage convention of 1850 was held and the resolutions of\r\nthose pioneers were re-adopted by a large, enthusiastic audience.\r\nWomen followed party speakers, taking their audiences before and after\r\nthe political meeting. State conventions of all sorts were appealed to\r\nand many gave endorsement, those of the Republicans and the Democrats\r\nrefusing. Groups of workers would visit a county, separate and canvass\r\nall the towns and then keep up their courage by returning to the\r\ncounty seat at night and comparing notes. Street meetings and noon\r\nmeetings for working people were held. Everything which had been tried\r\nout in any campaign was done.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of 1913 to the election in November, 1914, there\r\nwas constant work done for the amendment. The total number of votes\r\ncast on it was 853,685; against, 518,295; for 335,390; lost by 182,905\r\nvotes. There were gains in every county but only 14 were carried,\r\nwhere there had been 24 in 1912.\r\n\r\nThat the liquor interests and the anti-suffragists worked together was\r\nclearly established. The Saturday preceding the election the president\r\nof the State Suffrage association saw in her own city of Warren a man\r\ndistributing literature from door to door and accompanied by a witness\r\nshe followed him and picked up several packages in different parts of\r\nthe city. They contained two leaflets, one giving information on how\r\nto vote on the Home Rule or \"wet\" amendment, the other giving\r\ninstructions how to vote against the suffrage amendment. The latter\r\nhad a facsimile ballot marked against it and was signed by five women.\r\nThe _Liberal Advocate_ of Oct. 21, 1914, (official organ of the liquor\r\ninterests), published at Columbus, had a picture and a write-up of\r\nMrs. A. J. George of Brookline, a speaker from the Massachusetts\r\nAnti-Suffrage Association, with a headline saying that she would be\r\npresent at a luncheon of anti-suffragists on the 27th in that city and\r\nalso speak elsewhere in the State.\r\n\r\nAfter the defeats of 1912 and 1914 the suffragists abandoned the idea\r\nof carrying an amendment. The revised constitution provided for \"home\r\nrule\" for cities, which allowed them to adopt their own charters\r\ninstead of going to the Legislature. Suffragists believed that these\r\ncharters could provide for woman suffrage in municipal affairs. In\r\n1916 East Cleveland decided to frame a charter and they saw a chance\r\nto make a test. This campaign was the work of the Woman Suffrage Party\r\nof Greater Cleveland. On June 6 a city charter was submitted to the\r\nvoters and adopted including woman suffrage. A suit was brought to\r\ntest its constitutionality and it was argued in the Supreme Court, one\r\nof the lawyers being a woman, Miss Florence E. Allen.[142] By\r\nagreement between the court and election officials women voted at the\r\nregular municipal election in November. The court upheld its validity\r\nApril 3, 1917, and the constitutionality of Municipal woman suffrage\r\nin charter cities was established.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1917 the women of Lakewood, a city adjoining Cleveland\r\non the west, gave municipal suffrage to its women by charter after a\r\nvigorous campaign. Columbus undertook to put this in its charter and a\r\nbitter campaign took place. It was the house to house canvass and the\r\ncourageous work of the Columbus women and State suffrage officers\r\nwhich brought the victory when it was voted on at the election in\r\nAugust, 1917. Sandusky was not successful.\r\n\r\nA partial poll of the Legislature on the subject of Presidential\r\nsuffrage for women in 1915 had shown that it would be futile to\r\nattempt it but after endorsements of woman suffrage by the national\r\nparty conventions in 1916 it was determined to try.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of 1917 was Democratic and Representative James A.\r\nReynolds (Cleveland) met the State suffrage workers upon their arrival\r\nin Columbus for the opening of the session and informed them that he\r\nwas going to sponsor their bill. On January 16 Representative Pratt,\r\nRepublican, of Ashtabula and Mr. Reynolds, Democrat, each introduced a\r\nmeasure for Presidential suffrage. By agreement the Reynolds bill was\r\nchosen and he fought the battle for it against great odds. He was the\r\none anti-prohibitionist who worked for it, considering it his duty and\r\nhis privilege, and, because of his standing and because his party was\r\nin power, he was the only one perhaps who could have carried it\r\nthrough. He stood by the suffragists until Tennessee had ratified and\r\nthe contest was over.\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 30, 1917, the bill to give women a vote for Presidential\r\nelectors was reported favorably from the House Committee on Elections,\r\nand on February 1 it passed the House by 72 ayes, 50 noes, fifty-five\r\nper cent. of the Democratic members voting for it and sixty-nine per\r\ncent of the Republicans. In the Senate the leader of the \"wets\"\r\nintroduced a resolution for the submission of a full suffrage\r\namendment in the hope of sidetracking the Reynolds bill but the latter\r\nreached the Senate February 2, before the Holden bill could be\r\nconsidered. The suffragists, wishing to expedite matters, did not ask\r\nfor a hearing but the \"antis\" did and at Mr. Reynolds' request the\r\nformer were present. At this hearing the women leaders of the \"antis\"\r\nand the liquor men occupied seats together on the floor of the Senate.\r\nThe next morning the bill was reported favorably from the Federal\r\nRelations Committee and passed on February 14, by 19 ayes, 17 noes.\r\nImmediately the leader of the opposition changed his vote to yes in\r\norder to move a reconsideration. This he was not permitted to do\r\nbecause a friend of the measure forced the reconsideration the next\r\nday, and as this was lost by a vote of 24 to 10, the bill itself went\r\non record as having received the vote of the \"wet\" leader and having\r\npassed by 20 to 16. Governor James M. Cox signed it Feb. 21.\r\n\r\nVery soon the opponents opened headquarters in Columbus and circulated\r\npetitions to have the Presidential suffrage bill referred to the\r\nvoters for repeal. The story of these petitions is a disgraceful one.\r\nFour-fifths of the signatures were gathered in saloons, the petitions\r\nkept on the back and front bars. Hundreds of names were certified to\r\nby men who declared they saw them signed, an impossibility unless they\r\nstood by the bar eighteen hours each day for some weeks and watched\r\nevery signature. Some petitions, according to the dates they bore,\r\nwere circulated by the same men in different counties on the same day.\r\nSome of them had whole pages of signatures written in the same hand\r\nand some had names only, no addresses. The suffragists copied some of\r\nthese petitions after they were filed in Columbus and although the\r\ntime was short brought suit to prove them fraudulent in six counties.\r\nIn four the court ordered all but a few names thrown out. In Scioto\r\nall the names were rejected and in Cuyahoga county (Cleveland), 7,000\r\nnames were thrown out. The petitions in Franklin county (Columbus),\r\nLucas (Toledo) and Montgomery (Dayton) were unquestionably fraudulent\r\nbut the election boards were hostile to woman suffrage and powerful\r\nwith the courts and refused to bring cases. When suffrage leaders\r\nattempted to intervene the courts declared they had no jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe suffragists were on duty in Columbus from January to\r\nOctober,--long, weary, exciting months. It was clearly proved in the\r\ncases brought that the petitions were fraudulently circulated, signed,\r\nattested and certified. In the course of an attempt to bring a case\r\nagainst Franklin county a ruling of the Common Pleas Court was that\r\nthe Secretary of State should be restrained from counting the\r\nsignatures from seventeen counties because the Board of Elections had\r\nnot properly certified them. The Secretary of State telegraphed these\r\nboards and they certified again, although there is no constitutional\r\nor statutory provision for recertification. Nevertheless when these\r\ncorrected certifications were made the Judge dissolved the injunction\r\nand 17,000 names were restored to the petition. U. S. Senator Warren\r\nG. Harding in a Decoration Day speech at Columbus declared himself\r\ndecidedly opposed to accepting this referendum.\r\n\r\nCases were brought to the Supreme Court via the Court of Appeals, one\r\na general suit demanding that petitions from certain counties be\r\nrejected because they were fraudulent and insufficient, the other to\r\nmandamus the Secretary of State to give the suffragists a hearing to\r\nprove their charges. The first was dismissed, the Supreme Court saying\r\nit had no jurisdiction over a case which had not been finished in the\r\ncourt from which the appeal had been taken. They returned to the Court\r\nof Appeals and tried one case on the constitutionality of the law of\r\n1915, which gives the Board of Elections and Common Pleas Judges the\r\nright to examine the petitions and pass upon their validity, instead\r\nof the Secretary of State. The court decided to give no decision as\r\nelection was so near at hand.\r\n\r\nThe law made no provision to meet the expenses of petition suits and\r\nthe suffragists had to bear the cost, no small undertaking. The\r\nelection boards which were dominated by politicians who had been\r\nnotorious for their opposition to suffrage, interposed every possible\r\nobstacle to the attempt of the suffragists to uncover fraud. In some\r\ncounties it was impossible to bring cases. Women were absorbed in war\r\nwork and thousands of them bitterly resented the fact that at such a\r\ntime their right to vote should be questioned. The referendum was\r\nsubmitted with the proposal so worded on the ballot that it was\r\nextremely difficult to know whether to vote yes or no.\r\n\r\nAt the election in November, 1917, the majority voted in favor of\r\ntaking away from women the Presidential suffrage. The vote for\r\nretaining it was 422,262; against, 568,382; the law repealed by a\r\nmajority of 146,120. More votes were polled in 1917 than in 1914. The\r\nlaw was upheld in 15 counties, in 11 of which suffrage had then\r\ncarried three times.\r\n\r\nOhio suffragists now turned their attention entirely towards national\r\nwork. It was apparent that while the liquor interests continued their\r\nfight, women with a few thousand dollars, working for principle, could\r\nnever overcome men with hundreds of thousands of dollars working for\r\ntheir own political and financial interests. Intensive organized\r\ncongressional work was carried on henceforth for the Federal Suffrage\r\nAmendment. When the vote on it was taken in the House of\r\nRepresentatives Jan. 10, 1918, eight of Ohio's twenty-two Congressmen\r\nvoted for it. Three years before, Jan. 12, 1915, only five had voted\r\nin favor. In the U. S. Senate, Oct. 1, 1918, Senator Atlee Pomerene\r\nvoted No; Senator Warren G. Harding paired in favor. On Feb. 10, 1919,\r\nSenator Harding voted Yes; Senator Pomerene No.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature in 1919, Republican by a large majority in both\r\nHouses, endorsed the Federal Amendment by a vote of 23 to 10 in the\r\nSenate, 79 to 31 in the House. When the vote was taken in the National\r\nHouse of Representatives, May 21, 1919, only two Ohio members voted\r\nNo, one a Democrat, Warren Gard of Hamilton, one a Republican, A. E.\r\nB. Stephens of Cincinnati. When the final vote was taken in the Senate\r\nJune 4, 1919, Senator Harding voted Yes, Senator Pomerene, No.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. The Legislature was so eager to ratify that it had only\r\nrecessed instead of adjourning so that it could come together for that\r\npurpose whenever the amendment was submitted. Representative Reynolds\r\nhad again introduced a Presidential suffrage measure, and C. H. Fouts\r\nof Morgan county, to carry out the Republican platform, had presented\r\na full suffrage proposal. Both were held back until the fate of the\r\nNational Amendment should be known. The legislators assembled to\r\nratify on June 16 and the House vote was 76 ayes, 6 noes. In order\r\nthat the women might be sure of a vote at the next election the\r\nPresidential suffrage bill was immediately passed by a vote of 75\r\nayes, 5 noes. The House was in an uproar, cheering, laughing and\r\ntalking. Then a committee came to the suffrage leaders who were now on\r\nthe floor, always heretofore in the gallery, and escorted them to the\r\nSenate through the legislative passage way which had always before\r\nbeen closed to them. The Senate ratified by a vote of 27 ayes, 3 noes.\r\nThe Presidential bill was read, debated and passed by the Senate late\r\nthat night by 27 ayes, 3 noes.\r\n\r\nNever was there a finer example of cooperation than in this\r\nratification of the Federal Amendment. The adoption of the joint\r\nresolution was moved by the Republican floor leader and seconded by\r\nthe Democratic floor leader. The same spirit characterized the passage\r\nof the Presidential suffrage bill. Mr. Reynolds, fearing some\r\nprejudice might attach to it if it bore his name, as he was a minority\r\nparty member, proposed to the Republican leaders that the name of\r\nSpeaker Kimball be substituted. The Speaker replied: \"No, you deserve\r\nto have it go through with your name attached.\" Mr. Reynolds then\r\nasked that the name of Mr. Fouts be added because he had introduced a\r\nfull suffrage measure, and it became the Reynolds-Fouts Bill. Miss\r\nHauser, editor of the _Bulletin_, official organ of the State Suffrage\r\nAssociation, said in it: \"We had just witnessed a perfect exhibition\r\nof team work and a demonstration of loyalty to a cause and to each\r\nother by members of opposing political parties that was heart warming.\r\nWe had finished the suffrage fight in Ohio as Mrs. Upton had always\r\nwanted to finish it, with love, good will and harmony in our own\r\nranks, and, so far as we were able to judge, with nothing but good\r\nwill from the men with whom we had worked since the present stage of\r\nthe contest was inaugurated in 1912.\"\r\n\r\nThe suffragists believed the fight was over, not so the opponents.\r\nThey at once secured referendum petitions on both ratification and\r\nPresidential suffrage. In 1918 the Home Rule Association (the liquor\r\ninterests) had initiated and carried at the November election an\r\namendment to the State constitution providing that Federal amendments\r\nmust be approved by the voters before the ratification of the\r\nLegislature was effective. This was designed primarily to secure a\r\nreversal of prohibition in Ohio but also to prevent ratification of\r\nthe suffrage amendment.[143]\r\n\r\nIn collecting their petitions the same old tactics were employed. The\r\npersonnel of the workers was largely the same, with the addition of a\r\nState Senator from Cincinnati as general manager. The money to finance\r\nthe campaign came principally from that city and this time members of\r\nthe women's Anti-Suffrage Association were contributors. The saloons\r\nwere now closed and pious instructions were given not to have the\r\npetitions circulated by saloon keepers or bar tenders. Nevertheless\r\nnearly 600 of them were circulated by men who had been connected with\r\nthe saloon business, some of them now conducting soft drink\r\nestablishments, and the signatures were plainly of the most illiterate\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nThe State Suffrage Association persuaded the National American\r\nAssociation to attack the constitutionality of this referendum in the\r\ncourts and suit was accordingly brought. Eventually it was sustained\r\nby the Supreme Court of Ohio and was carried to the U. S. Supreme\r\nCourt by George Hawk, a young lawyer of Cincinnati. It rendered a\r\ndecision that the power to ratify a Federal Amendment rested in the\r\nLegislature and could not be passed on by the voters.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature in an adjourned session in 1920 gave women Primary\r\nsuffrage in an amendment to the Presidential bill, but the final\r\nratification of the Federal Amendment in August made all partial\r\nmeasures unnecessary, as it completely enfranchised women.[144] Thus\r\nafter a struggle of seventy years those of Ohio received the suffrage\r\nat last from the national government, but they were deeply\r\nappreciative and grateful to those heroic men of the State who fought\r\ntheir battles through the years.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[139] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Harriet Taylor\r\nUpton, treasurer of the National Woman Suffrage Association 1893-1910;\r\npresident of the Ohio Woman Suffrage Association 1899-1908 and\r\n1911-1920.\r\n\r\n[140] These conventions were held in the following order: Athens,\r\nSpringfield, Cleveland, Sandusky, London, Youngstown, Toledo, Warren,\r\nColumbus, Elyria, Lima, Columbus, Cincinnati, Columbus, Cleveland,\r\nLima, Dayton, Columbus (last three years).\r\n\r\n[141] The executive officers who finished the work of the State\r\nAssociation were as follows: Honorary president, Mrs. Frances M.\r\nCasement, Painesville; president, Mrs. Upton, Warren; first, second\r\nand third vice-presidents, Zara du Pont, Cleveland; Dora Sandoe\r\nBachman, Columbus; Mrs. J. C. Wallace, Cincinnati; corresponding\r\nsecretary, Mrs. Kent Hughes, Lima; recording secretary, Margaret J.\r\nBrandenburg, Oxford; treasurer, Zell Hart Deming, Warren; member of\r\nthe National Executive Committee, Mrs. O. F. Davisson, Dayton.\r\nChairmen: Organization Committee, Elizabeth J. Hauser, Girard;\r\nFinance, Miss Annie McCully, Dayton; Industrial, Rose Moriarty,\r\nCleveland; Enrollment, Mrs. C. H. Simonds, Conneaut; member Executive\r\nCommittee at Large, Mrs. Malcolm McBride, Cleveland.\r\n\r\n[142] Miss Allen was counsel in all court cases of the Ohio\r\nsuffragists from 1916 to 1920. In 1920 she was elected Judge in the\r\nCommon Pleas Court of Cuyahoga county (Cleveland), the first woman in\r\nthe United States to fill such an office.\r\n\r\n[143] Several years before the \"wets,\" this time under the name of the\r\nStability League, had initiated an amendment, which, if it had been\r\ncarried, would have prohibited the submission of the same amendment\r\noftener than once in six years. Thus the suffragists in 1916, 1917 and\r\n1918 were in the courts for months each year.\r\n\r\n[144] In the presidential campaign of 1920 Mrs. Upton was appointed\r\nvice-chairman of the Republican National Executive Committee, the\r\nhighest political position ever held by a woman, and she had charge of\r\nthe activities of women during that campaign. Her last work for woman\r\nsuffrage was during the strenuous effort to obtain the 36th and final\r\nratification of the Federal Amendment from the Tennessee Legislature\r\nin the summer of 1920, when she went to Nashville at the request of\r\nthe National Republican Committee.--Ed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nOKLAHOMA.[145]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the time Oklahoma Territory was opened to settlement in 1889\r\nefforts were made to obtain the franchise for women, first by the\r\nWoman's Christian Temperance Union, and in 1895 the National American\r\nWoman Suffrage Association sent organizers and an auxiliary was\r\nformed. It held annual conventions and bills were presented to the\r\nLegislature but when one had been grossly betrayed in the Senate after\r\npassing the House in 1899 no further effort was made for a number of\r\nyears.[146] Finally in answer to requests sent to the National\r\nAssociation, an organizer, Miss Laura Gregg of Kansas, was sent to the\r\nTerritory in March, 1904. She was cordially received and spent the\r\nnext eight months in speaking and organizing suffrage clubs. In\r\nDecember Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, the national president, joined her for\r\na two-weeks' series of conferences in the large places, in each of\r\nwhich a society was formed.\r\n\r\nA convention of Oklahoma and Indian Territory delegates was called for\r\nDecember 15-16 in Oklahoma City. Dr. Shaw presided at the first\r\nsession and delivered an address to a large audience. Over sixty\r\nmembers were added to the city club and from this time it was the most\r\nactive in the State. Statehood was being agitated and a letter was\r\nread from Miss Susan B. Anthony, honorary president of the National\r\nAssociation, which said: \"No stone should be left unturned to secure\r\nsuffrage for the women while Oklahoma is yet a Territory, for if it\r\ncomes into the Union without this in its constitution it will take a\r\nlong time and a great deal of hard work to convert over one-half of\r\nthe men to vote for it.\"\r\n\r\nLetters expressing a strong desire for the franchise were read from\r\nwomen in different parts of the Territories. The Twin Territorial\r\nAssociation was organized and a resolution was adopted calling for\r\nstatehood and saying: \"Said statehood shall never enact any law\r\nrestricting the right of suffrage on account of sex, race, color or\r\nprevious condition of servitude.\" Prominent at this convention were\r\nMrs. Kate H. Biggers, Mrs. Julia Woodworth, Mrs. Anna Laskey and Mrs.\r\nJence C. Feuquay. The officers elected were: president, Mrs. Biggers,\r\nIndian Territory; first vice-president, Mrs. Woodworth; second, Mrs.\r\nAnna M. Bennett; corresponding secretary, Mrs. Laskey; recording\r\nsecretary, Mrs. Louisa Boylan McLoud; treasurer, Miss Margaret Rees;\r\nauditors, Mrs. Rebecca Forney and Mrs. Mary B. Green, all of Oklahoma\r\nTerritory, and Mrs. Mary C. Harvey of Indian Territory.\r\n\r\nThe second annual convention was held Oct. 26-28, 1905, at Chickasha,\r\nIndian Territory. Mrs. Biggers, Mrs. Woodworth, Miss Rees and Mrs.\r\nGreen were re-elected. New officers were, Mrs. Minnie Keith Bailey,\r\nMrs. Cleo Ikard Harris, Mrs. Ida Wood Norvell, Mrs. Jessie Livingston\r\nParks and Mrs. Hattie Sherman. Vigorous protest had been made by women\r\nthroughout the Territories against the bill for statehood which had\r\nbeen presented to Congress, classifying women in the suffrage section\r\nwith illiterates, minors, felons, insane and feeble-minded. The matter\r\nwas also taken up by the National Association. [See Chapter V, Volume\r\nV.] Later when bills in the Territorial Legislature for a\r\nconstitutional convention repeated this clause a conference was held\r\nwith the officers of the W. C. T. U. and hundreds of letters of\r\nprotest were sent.\r\n\r\nAs a constitutional convention seemed near at hand Dr. Frances Woods\r\nof South Dakota was sent by the National Association to organize in\r\nIndian Territory. With the help of Mrs. Woodworth she secured hearings\r\nbefore women's clubs and W. C. T. U.'s, addressed State Labor and\r\nPress Associations and was invited to speak to a Farmers' Institute\r\n300 miles away with her expenses paid. Miss Gregg continued the\r\norganizing in Oklahoma, addressing an audience of 6,000 at the Grand\r\nArmy of the Republic encampment and speaking to teachers' institutes,\r\nbusiness colleges, country school house meetings and women's clubs.\r\nOne issue of the _Messenger_, the U. C. T. U. organ, was devoted to\r\nwoman suffrage. The membership increased; over 75 papers used suffrage\r\narticles and much literature donated by the National Association was\r\ncirculated. The Oklahoma City Club, Mrs. Adelia C. Stephens,\r\npresident, was especially active in having the women register for the\r\nschool elections, in which they could vote for trustees, in order to\r\ndefeat the school book trust, and 600 did so.\r\n\r\nIn May Dr. Woods spoke at the annual meeting of the Woman's Relief\r\nCorps in Oklahoma City and a resolution was passed favoring woman\r\nsuffrage. The Grand Army of the Republic, in session at the same time,\r\ngave her a place on an evening program at the Opera House, where she\r\naddressed a large, enthusiastic audience. Mrs. Biggers attended the\r\nannual meeting of the Twin Territories Labor Union, which unanimously\r\nadopted a resolution for woman suffrage. In Tulsa on Labor Day the\r\n\"float\" of the suffragists in the big procession won the prize. At\r\nChickasha during the agricultural fair the tent of the suffrage club\r\nhad the best location on the grounds. Dr. Woods and Mrs. Biggers went\r\nto Muskogee to see Robert L. Owen, a prominent lawyer, and enlist his\r\nstrong influence in favor of a woman suffrage clause in the new\r\nconstitution. He cordially promised his influence, service and\r\nfinancial assistance and he made his first great suffrage speech in\r\nOklahoma City before the convention took place. Dr. Woods left the\r\nlast of May and the National Association sent Mrs. Ida Porter Boyer of\r\nPennsylvania in October, 1906, to establish headquarters. When the\r\nconstitutional convention opened in Guthrie they were transferred\r\nthere, with Mrs. Biggers and Mrs. Boyer in charge. Miss Laura Clay of\r\nKentucky, a national officer, went to their assistance at her own\r\nexpense and Mrs. Mary C. C. Bradford of Colorado did some very\r\neffective speaking. In February, 1907, a hearing was granted by the\r\nSuffrage Committee of the convention. Later Mr. Owen, former Governor\r\nAlva Adams of Colorado and Miss Clay addressed the entire convention.\r\nMr. Owen engaged the Opera House for a mass meeting to influence the\r\ndelegates and paid for printing handsomely the Memorial which the\r\nState Suffrage Association presented to the convention.\r\n\r\nMrs. Boyer said. \"The woman suffrage measure caused the most heated\r\ndebate of the convention. It had been arranged by the political\r\nmanipulators to apply gag rule and shut off debate as soon as the\r\nopposition had exploited itself but on a motion to discuss the\r\nsuffrage resolution the vote stood 41 noes, 42 ayes, and the delegates\r\nfavoring it managed to secure the floor and hold it.\" Peter Hanraty,\r\nthe principal representative of the labor organizations, which were\r\npractically solid for a woman suffrage clause in the constitution, led\r\nthe debate in its favor. A number of prominent men spoke strongly for\r\nit. Some of the opposing speeches were very coarse. On the final vote\r\nit was lost by 50 nays to 37 ayes. Notwithstanding all that had been\r\ndone and said the suffrage clause in the new constitution read: \"The\r\nqualified electors shall be male citizens of the State and male\r\npersons of Indian descent, who are over 21 years of age....\r\nSpecifically excepted are felons, paupers, lunatics and idiots.\"\r\n\r\nThe headquarters were returned to Oklahoma City with Mrs. Boyer and\r\nMrs. Biggers still in charge and Miss Gregg continued her field work,\r\nas the suffragists desired to help some of their friends who were\r\ncandidates. Among them at the election in October, 1907, Bird S.\r\nMcGuire was elected member of Congress, Mr. Hanraty mine inspector,\r\nCharles L. Daugherty labor commissioner, Jesse L. Dunn and M. J. Kane\r\nJustices of the Supreme Court and fourteen to the Legislature. Charles\r\nW. Haskell, who had been among the bitterest of the opponents in the\r\nconvention, was elected Governor. When the first Legislature met in\r\nDecember, Mr. Owen was unanimously elected U. S. Senator and never\r\nthereafter failed to render assistance to both State and national\r\nsuffrage for women. Unsolicited Perry A. Ballard introduced a bill in\r\nthe House at the first session giving the Presidential franchise to\r\nwomen but it never came out of committee.\r\n\r\nThe suffrage work done in 1908 was principally through the society in\r\nOklahoma City. The State Federation of Labor at its annual convention\r\nendorsed woman suffrage and pledged its support to candidates for the\r\nLegislature who would submit the question to the voters. The\r\nSocialists also gave unqualified support. There was no official\r\nrecognition by Democrats or Republicans but a considerable per cent.\r\nof their legislative candidates declared themselves in favor of this\r\naction.\r\n\r\nState suffrage headquarters were opened in Guthrie in January, 1909,\r\nand Mrs. Boyer took charge. Members from clubs over the State came to\r\nassist in lobbying for the amendment and pledges were secured from a\r\nmajority in both Houses. Miss Kate M. Gordon of New Orleans,\r\ncorresponding secretary of the National Association, came to make the\r\nprincipal argument at the Senate hearing. One was granted also before\r\nthe Committee of the Whole. Mrs. N. M. Carter presided and strong\r\nappeals were made by Mrs. Boyer, Mrs. M. A. Morrison, Mrs. Feuquay and\r\nMrs. Bailey. A petition of 8,000 names was presented, which had been\r\nquickly collected, but it was treated with discourtesy, one member\r\ntearing up the sheets from his district and throwing them into the\r\nwaste basket. The Speaker jestingly referred it to the Committee on\r\nGeological Survey. The attendance was so great the hearing had to be\r\nadjourned to a larger room. Through every possible device and even\r\nconspiracy the measure was lost in the Senate, Governor Haskell using\r\nhis influence against it.\r\n\r\nIt was already evident that the amendment could be submitted only\r\nthrough the Initiative and Referendum. This was a new and not well\r\nunderstood law, there was little money in the treasury and the women\r\nwere tired and discouraged, saying, as Mrs. Woodworth expressed it:\r\n\"It's of no use, for the whisky ring and the grafters will beat us\r\nevery time.\" Nevertheless an undaunted few decided to begin the\r\nimmense work of securing the initiative petition. Mrs. Biggers was\r\ncontinued as president and Dr. Ruth A. Gay agreed to act as chairman\r\nof finance and conduct the petition work from her office in Oklahoma\r\nCity, with the cooperation of Mrs. Stephens, who went personally into\r\nthe counties. The National Association again sent Mrs. Boyer, who used\r\nher own room for headquarters in order to save money. She said in\r\nwriting of the summer's campaign:\r\n\r\n     The women circulated the petition and obtained nearly 38,600\r\n     signatures of voters--more than the necessary number. The State\r\n     was new; there were few trolleys in cities and still fewer\r\n     interurbans to make the rural communities accessible; the\r\n     railroads had infrequent and uncertain schedules. That petition\r\n     was a marvel in attainment and a monument of sacrifice. The\r\n     headquarters work has never been surpassed in devotion of local\r\n     suffragists. Do you know of any other State where the entire\r\n     campaign was carried on by but two paid workers--a manager and a\r\n     stenographer? Mrs. Stephens went into the field and Mrs. Biggers\r\n     remained with the office work and spent her money freely. Dr. Gay\r\n     sacrificed time from her practice and pressed her father and\r\n     mother into service so that literature might be addressed to the\r\n     voters. Mrs. Woodworth, Mrs. Feuquay, Mrs. Burt, Mrs. Mattie\r\n     Flick, Mrs. Dunham and her daughter Junia and Miss Mary Barber\r\n     worked day and night in the office or the field.\r\n\r\nAltogether $900 were raised. To this amount Miss Clay contributed\r\n$300; Henry B. and Alice Stone Blackwell (Mass.) $400 and also lent\r\nmoney. Most of the women worked gratuitously and paid their own\r\nexpenses. Oklahoma City was canvassed without cost. When the petition\r\nwas ready for filing a representative committee of women carried it to\r\nGuthrie and Secretary of State Cross complimented its excellent\r\narrangement. So quietly had it been secured that the \"machine\"\r\npoliticians were astounded and dismayed when it was presented and\r\nplans were at once made to attack its validity. Senator Roddie was\r\nchosen to protest it on the ground that 5,000 of the signatures were\r\nfraudulent but he offered no proof of the charge. Three eminent\r\nlawyers, Judge J. B. A. Robertson, Democratic candidate for Governor;\r\nJudge T. L. Brown, a Republican, and P. J. Nagel, a Socialist, gave\r\ntheir services to the suffragists. The first argued for the justice of\r\nsubmitting the amendment; the second defended the legality of the\r\npetition and the third demanded recognition of the 38,586 voters who\r\nhad signed it. Secretary of State Cross announced a recess until 2 p.\r\nm. At that hour he declared that the petition was \"in due form of law\r\nand amply sufficient in all things and that the question thereby\r\nproposed should be certified to the Governor to the end that the same\r\nmay be submitted to the electors of the State as is provided by law.\"\r\nSenator Roddie then appealed to the Supreme Court, which in June,\r\n1910, sustained the petition.\r\n\r\nBelieving that the petition would be upheld the suffragists had opened\r\nheadquarters in the Lee Huckins Hotel in Oklahoma City February 1.\r\nThere was hope of a special election for the amendment, in which case\r\nit could be carried by a majority of those voting on it. If it went to\r\nthe regular election it would require a majority of the highest\r\nnumber of votes cast. It finally went over to the general election.\r\nThere was no money for salaries and very little for expenses. Mrs.\r\nBoyer conducted a very efficient publicity service and was obliged to\r\nfill many appointments as a speaker, besides having all the office\r\nwork in charge, making it necessary for her to toil far into the\r\nnights. Mrs. Biggers carried on the work during Mrs. Boyer's absences.\r\nOften there was no money for postage and Dr. Gay would go out and beg\r\na few dollars from some friend of the cause.\r\n\r\nIt being a State campaign year there were many opportunities for work\r\nat picnics and tent meetings arranged for the candidates. The\r\nDemocrats were the dominant party and principal opposers. Among their\r\ncandidates were few avowed friends or active helpers and some were\r\nopenly and bitterly opposed. Women who had never made a public speech\r\nhad to meet their eloquence and sophistry. Mrs. Stephens and Miss Mary\r\nBarber were sent into the most hostile part of the State and worked\r\nthrough the heat and dust of almost the entire summer. They spoke from\r\nboxes and wagons; in little dark school houses with only one smoky\r\nkerosene lamp, making it impossible to read their notes or see the\r\naudience; before large, unsympathetic crowds at open air meetings. It\r\nwas an experience that tested endurance and loyalty almost to the\r\nbreaking point.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists were always helpful but they were intensely disliked\r\nand sometimes their friendship only made the way more difficult. The\r\nlabor unions were unusually helpful and never antagonistic. Toward the\r\nlast of the campaign the secretary of the State Federation of Labor,\r\nJ. Luther Langston, with Miss Gordon made a two-weeks' speaking tour\r\nthrough the State. The vote was taken Nov. 8, 1910, and was announced\r\nas ayes, 88,808; noes, 128,928; lost by 40,120. While the\r\ndisappointment was intense yet as an education this campaign could not\r\nbe overestimated.[147]\r\n\r\nThere was still a desire to keep the organization alive and be ready\r\nfor the next opportunity. In 1911 Mrs. Biggers declined to stand again\r\nfor the presidency, after serving seven years, and Dr. Ruth A. Gay,\r\nwith a full board, was elected at the annual convention, Mrs. Biggers\r\ntaking the office of treasurer. At the State meeting of 1912 Mrs.\r\nMattie Flick, Miss Jessie Nourse and Mrs. Mattie Cloud were added to\r\nthe board. Dr. Gay held the presidency until 1913, when Mrs. Cora B.\r\nGotchy was elected. The State association became a member of the\r\nSouthern Women's Conference. No further effort was made with the\r\nLegislature but the Republican party put a woman suffrage plank in its\r\nState platform and the Progressive party took steps toward another\r\ninitiative petition, Mrs. Gotchy assisting, but it did not meet with\r\nsupport. Mrs. Feuquay was selected for president in 1914 and helped a\r\nresolution for an amendment introduced in the Legislature by the\r\nSocialist Representatives McLemore and Pritchett, which did not come\r\nout of committee.\r\n\r\nIn 1915 Mrs. Adelia C. Stephens was elected president. The\r\nvice-president, Miss Mary Crangle, in the northeastern part of the\r\nState, and the recording secretary, Mrs. Frances A. Agnew, in the\r\nsouthwestern part, did active personal work to keep up the interest.\r\nThe Democratic Secretary of State, J. L. Lyon, made strenuous\r\nindividual effort to start an initiative petition, which was not\r\nsuccessful. Suffrage resolutions were introduced by legislators\r\nindependently in the session of 1915 and the special session of 1916.\r\nLuther Harrison and Charles F. Barrett, now Adjutant General, were\r\nhelpful friends in the Legislature. Mrs. Stephens was continued as\r\npresident through 1916 and 1917.[148] In 1916 the resolution for a\r\nsuffrage amendment passed the House by a vote of 62 to 15 but was\r\nadversely reported by the Senate Committee.\r\n\r\nSince 1910 Mrs. Woodworth had kept the question of woman suffrage\r\ncontinually before the State Federation of Women's Clubs and in all\r\norganizations of women there was an increasing interest in\r\nlegislation, especially for the benefit of women and children, and\r\nthey were seeing the necessity of the ballot as a means of attaining\r\nit. Meanwhile most of the States west of the Mississippi River had\r\nenfranchised their women and for months before the Legislature\r\nconvened in 1917 letters and telegrams came in announcing that former\r\nfoes had become friends, many of them offering to help the cause.\r\nWoman suffrage was the first subject discussed when the Legislature\r\nconvened. The resolution to submit an amendment was championed in the\r\nSenate by Senators Fred Tucker of Ardmore, John Golobie of Guthrie,\r\nWalter Ferguson of Cherokee and many others. In the House among the\r\nmost earnest supporters were Paul Nesbitt of McAlester and Bert C.\r\nHodges of Okmulgee. The vote in the Senate February 2 was unanimous\r\nand in the House March 17 was 75 ayes, 12 noes.\r\n\r\nWomen over the State watched anxiously the action of the Legislature\r\nand many were in attendance. Mrs. Stephens, Mrs. Frank Mulkey of\r\nOklahoma City and Mrs. Robert Ray of Lawton were especially active but\r\nthe chief credit belongs to Mrs. Frank B. Lucas, legislative\r\nrepresentative of the Federation of Women's Clubs, with wide\r\nexperience in legislative procedure. Mrs. Woodworth and Mrs. Lucas had\r\nacted as committee for the State suffrage association, which now\r\nmerged with the campaign committee.\r\n\r\nThe campaign was made particularly difficult by the fact that Governor\r\nRobert L. Williams, Attorney General S. P. Freeling and the chairman\r\nof the State Election Board, W. C. McAlester, all Democrats, were\r\navowed and active anti-suffragists, notwithstanding the party had\r\ndeclared in State convention in favor of the amendment. Encouraged by\r\neastern women an Anti-Suffrage Committee was formed with Mrs. T. H.\r\nSturgeon chairman and Miss Maybelle Stuard press chairman and speaker,\r\nboth of Oklahoma City. Other women prominent in the movement were Miss\r\nEdith Johnson, of the _Daily Oklahoman_ and Miss Alice Robertson of\r\nMuskogee, who were very active in the distribution of the usual\r\n\"anti\" literature, attempting to link the suffragists with Germans and\r\nwith the negro vote. Miss Charlotte Rowe of Yonkers, N. Y.,\r\nrepresenting the National Anti-Suffrage Association, remained in\r\nOklahoma during most of the campaign but their work was scattered and\r\nineffectual.\r\n\r\nThe election took place Nov. 8, 1918, and the amendment received a\r\nmajority of 25,428 of the votes cast on it. It had a majority of 9,791\r\nof the highest number of votes cast at the election, a record that\r\nnever had been equalled in any State. After the National League of\r\nWomen Voters was organized at the convention of the National American\r\nSuffrage Association in March, 1919, a State League was formed in\r\nOklahoma with Mrs. Phil Brown of Muskogee chairman.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReport of Mrs. Shuler to the Board of the National American Woman\r\nSuffrage Association on the Oklahoma Campaign.\r\n\r\n     Against the advice of the National Board with conditions adverse\r\n     as they were in Oklahoma the legislative committee of the State\r\n     Federation of Women's Clubs and some members of the State\r\n     suffrage board secured the submission of an amendment to the\r\n     voters in 1917 and appealed for help to the National Association.\r\n     It found that the Oklahoma association was not organized as in\r\n     other States with the club as the unit but was composed of\r\n     individual memberships and was not an auxiliary of the National\r\n     Association, not having paid dues for several years. After\r\n     obtaining the submission there seemed to be a desire on the part\r\n     of the women to waive all responsibility for the campaign, but\r\n     they said that if the National Association considered the winning\r\n     of it a necessity to its program, it should assume the entire\r\n     financial responsibility.\r\n\r\n     On Jan. 19, 1918, Mrs. Nettie Rogers Shuler, corresponding\r\n     secretary and chairman of campaigns and surveys; Mrs. T. T.\r\n     Cotnam of Arkansas and Mrs. Charles H. Brooks of Kansas,\r\n     directors of the National American Association, reached Oklahoma\r\n     City. Several conferences were held with the State board none of\r\n     whose members could give all their time to the campaign, although\r\n     two would work for salary and expenses. It was evident that a\r\n     Campaign Committee must be formed and new groups interested, to\r\n     which the board agreed. Forty-five women met at the Lee Huckins\r\n     Hotel on January 21, adopted a plan for work and agreed to raise\r\n     a budget of $25,000, Mrs. Shuler stating that no financial\r\n     assistance from the National Association could be given until the\r\n     Board had taken action on her \"survey\" of conditions. Mrs. John\r\n     Threadgill was elected chairman of the campaign committee with a\r\n     salary of $100 a month and Mrs. Julia Woodworth, the former State\r\n     secretary, was made executive secretary at a salary of $15 a\r\n     week. Mrs. Frank B. Lucas, chairman of finance, agreed to raise\r\n     the $25,000 necessary for the campaign with the understanding\r\n     that she was to have personally 10 per cent. of the money raised.\r\n     She raised a little over $2,000 and resigned April 1.\r\n\r\n     An organization of young women was formed in Oklahoma City and\r\n     State and city headquarters were opened in the Terminal Arcade.\r\n     Two organizers, Miss Josephine Miller who remained one week and\r\n     Miss Gertrude Watkins who remained three weeks, were sent by the\r\n     National Association. Miss Lola Walker came January 30, Miss\r\n     Margaret Thompson, a volunteer, and Miss Edna Annette Beveridge\r\n     in February, all remaining through the campaign.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Shuler left April 6 for South Dakota and Michigan, both in\r\n     amendment campaigns. While in Oklahoma she had visited\r\n     twenty-seven counties out of the seventy-seven and organization\r\n     had been effected in thirty-two county seats; also the passage\r\n     obtained of a resolution by the Democratic and Republican State\r\n     Committees not only endorsing but promising to work for the\r\n     amendment. A Campaign Committee had been formed with\r\n     representatives from seventeen organizations of men and women\r\n     representing different groups with widely diversified interests.\r\n     Ten State vice-chairmen had been selected from different sections\r\n     and eleven chairmen of active committees. Headquarters had been\r\n     opened in Tulsa and Muskogee and others promised in the larger\r\n     cities. A canvass had been made of forty-six newspapers showing\r\n     only five to be absolutely opposed. The State had been divided\r\n     into ten districts and it was hoped that each might have the\r\n     services later of an experienced national worker.\r\n\r\n     On April 17, 18, a meeting of the Executive Council of the\r\n     National Association was held in Indianapolis. The Board took\r\n     action on Oklahoma, agreeing to give organizers, press work and\r\n     literature to the amount of $13,650, provided the State would put\r\n     two more trained organizers in the field immediately and raise\r\n     the rest of the \"budget,\" about $11,000. Mrs. Threadgill\r\n     attending this meeting and agreed to the plan.\r\n\r\n     On May 1 Miss Marjorie Shuler was sent by the National\r\n     Association to take entire charge of press and political work,\r\n     and, to quote from Miss Katherine Pierce's report, \"to her\r\n     effective work with the newspapers of the State was due in a\r\n     great measure the success of the campaign.\" Three hundred were\r\n     supplied with weekly bulletins and two-and-a-half pages of plate,\r\n     and the last week 126,000 copies of a suffrage supplement sent\r\n     from national headquarters in New York were circulated through\r\n     the newspapers. As a unit the suffrage organization was used for\r\n     the 3rd and 4th Liberty Loans, and a statewide Unconditional\r\n     Surrender Club, in which nearly 100,000 members were enrolled,\r\n     was organized by Miss Shuler. In the face of these activities the\r\n     men paid little heed to the charges of pacifism and lack of\r\n     patriotism made against the suffragists by paid \"anti\" speakers\r\n     sent in from outside the State.\r\n\r\n     May 1 found the Campaign Committee without funds and a meeting\r\n     held in Oklahoma City early in the month passed the following\r\n     resolution: \"On account of the unusual conditions prevailing at\r\n     this time which have caused the Oklahoma State Campaign Committee\r\n     to find itself unable to meet the expenses of the campaign, said\r\n     committee does hereby dissolve and stands ready to cooperate in\r\n     any way possible in any plans that may be evolved by the National\r\n     Board, hoping for its continued aid and support and expressing\r\n     warmest thanks and most earnest appreciation of the generous aid\r\n     and assistance already given.\" This resolution was unanimously\r\n     carried, the committee dissolved and Mrs. Clarence Henley was\r\n     made chairman, Mrs. Frank Haskell, vice chairman, Mrs. A..\r\n     Crockett, secretary, Mrs. Blanche Hawley, treasurer, and Mrs. C.\r\n     B. Ames, chairman of finance of a new one. As the State had not\r\n     put in the two trained organizers, the National Board sent Mrs.\r\n     Mary K. Maule in April and Misses Alice Curtis and Doris Long in\r\n     June.\r\n\r\n     One of the requirements by the National Association if financial\r\n     assistance were given was that States in campaign should secure\r\n     signatures of women on petitions. At the meeting in January\r\n     officers of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union agreed to take\r\n     entire charge of this work but later decided that it might injure\r\n     the chances for national prohibition. Its president, however,\r\n     Mrs. Abbie Hillerman of Sapulpa, served as an advisory member of\r\n     the Campaign Committee and with other members rendered valuable\r\n     assistance. Under the direction of Miss Curtis 58,687 signatures\r\n     were obtained.\r\n\r\n     In the meantime the Oklahoma City organization, which had for\r\n     officers a group of young women, was dissolved and their\r\n     headquarters given up. Money was needed to maintain State\r\n     headquarters, which were an absolute necessity. In June Mrs.\r\n     Henley, the chairman, sent a financial plan to all county\r\n     chairmen, asking for a certain sum from each county based on\r\n     population, wealth, etc. Some county chairmen resigned, which was\r\n     a discouragement to Mrs. Henley and to the national workers.\r\n     Early in July Mrs. Henley telegraphed her resignation to the\r\n     National Board, stating that the campaign must go by default\r\n     unless it would assume all financial obligation. Mrs. Catt, the\r\n     national president, wrote urging her not to resign and stating\r\n     that the National Association would pay salary and expenses of\r\n     all national organizers then in the field and would send other\r\n     workers as needed, providing Oklahoma would finance its State\r\n     headquarters and speakers' bureau and meet the pledge made in\r\n     April to pay salary and expenses of two workers. Mrs. Henley\r\n     remained chairman; Mary Parke London and Sally Fanny Gleaton were\r\n     sent by the board in July; Alma Sasse in August and Isabella\r\n     Sanders as headquarters secretary on September 1. Mrs. Shuler\r\n     returned from New York and took over the campaign for the final\r\n     two months, with headquarters in Oklahoma City.\r\n\r\n     All of the prominent suffragists in the State were doing war\r\n     work.... There was a depleted treasury. The Campaign Committee\r\n     was not able to pay for any workers in the field. Money was\r\n     needed for rent, postage, telegrams, stenographers' salaries,\r\n     etc. It became necessary for Mrs. Shuler and the organizers, in\r\n     addition to the detailed work of the campaign, to assume the\r\n     financial burden as well. Mrs. Shuler gave her personal check for\r\n     rent for August, September and October and with the national\r\n     assistants in the field and by personal appeals raised $2,433.\r\n     From January 21 to November 5, 1918, there came into the State\r\n     Campaign Committee's treasury $4,993 and of this amount $2,559\r\n     were spent from January to June for salaries of Mrs. Threadgill,\r\n     the chairman; Mrs. Woodworth, the secretary, and headquarters\r\n     expenses. These funds were checked out on warrants signed by them\r\n     and the checks signed by Mrs. Hawley, treasurer. From June to\r\n     November $2,433 were raised and checked out on warrants signed by\r\n     Mrs. Henley and checks signed by Mrs. Hawley for headquarters\r\n     expenses--not a penny going for salary or expenses of any\r\n     national worker. The sum of $79.92 remaining in the treasury at\r\n     the end was turned over to the Ratification Committee.\r\n\r\n     The Tulsa suffragists opened headquarters, engaged an executive\r\n     secretary and financed their own campaign. They also very\r\n     generously paid nearly $500 for the suffrage supplement\r\n     distributed through the State. There were other counties no doubt\r\n     where money was spent locally, but no record was sent to\r\n     headquarters. The National Association expended nearly $20,000 in\r\n     Oklahoma, the largest sum it had ever put into a State Campaign.\r\n     By September 1 it was paying salaries and expenses of eleven\r\n     national workers.[149]\r\n\r\n     When the epidemic regulations forbade meetings of more than\r\n     twelve persons, the suffragists resorted to all manner of devices\r\n     for voiceless speech and 150,000 fliers with the wording of the\r\n     amendment, directions how to vote and the warning that a \"silent\r\n     vote\" was a vote against it were distributed by hand and through\r\n     the mail. Other circularization, posting of towns at a specified\r\n     date and newspaper publicity were pushed. Much political help was\r\n     secured. Both Republican and Democratic State conventions passed\r\n     suffrage resolutions and preceding the Democratic nearly every\r\n     county convention passed such a resolution.\r\n\r\n     No work which the women did in the campaign was more effective\r\n     than their election day appeal. Nearly every polling place had\r\n     women watchers within and women scouts without. Whenever one\r\n     party in any place denied women the privilege of watching, they\r\n     secured appointments as regular watchers for the other party. An\r\n     amendment to the constitution of Oklahoma has to poll a majority\r\n     of the highest number of votes cast in the general election. The\r\n     \"silent vote\" is the term applied to the votes cast in the\r\n     election but not on the amendment and which are counted against\r\n     it. The task of arousing every man to such a degree of interest\r\n     that he would remember to mark his ballot on the suffrage\r\n     amendment seemed a hopeless task. Those who know the usual\r\n     inattention given to any constitutional amendment by the rank and\r\n     file of voters can estimate how difficult it was to get a\r\n     _majority of the ballots correctly marked_.\r\n\r\n     Early in September it was learned that the Elections Board,\r\n     claiming that the Secretary of State had failed to supply the\r\n     official wording of the amendment ninety days before election,\r\n     did not intend to print the suffrage amendment. Through the\r\n     efforts of Judge W. H. Ledbetter of Oklahoma City, who donated\r\n     his services, this obstacle was overcome, and then further to\r\n     increase the difficulties, the board decided to print the\r\n     suffrage amendment on a separate ballot. In October it was found\r\n     that soldiers had voted in seven camps but suffrage ballots had\r\n     not been furnished them and thus hundreds were prevented from\r\n     voting on the amendment, yet all of these were counted as voting\r\n     in the negative! The attempt to hold back the returns and to get\r\n     a new ruling on the meaning of the so-called \"silent vote\" are\r\n     matters of history.\r\n\r\n     On Friday after election it became apparent to the State\r\n     Elections Board that the suffrage majority was piling up and\r\n     there was every evidence that the amendment had won. On Saturday\r\n     it was reported that a member of the State Elections Board in\r\n     Oklahoma City had called up some chairmen of county elections\r\n     boards, asking that they open the sealed returns and send a\r\n     second report counting from the \"stubs,\" which would include the\r\n     mutilated and spoiled ballots, so as to increase further the\r\n     number of the \"silent votes.\" At that time the suffrage\r\n     headquarters had received returns from 63 out of 77 counties,\r\n     showing a majority of 21,000 of the votes cast on the amendment,\r\n     about 10,000 over the \"silent vote.\" The publication of these\r\n     attested returns prevented any further attempt to get them from\r\n     \"stub\" books. When all other resources failed, the\r\n     anti-suffragists filed a protest against certification by the\r\n     State Elections Board.\r\n\r\n     There were really two campaigns in Oklahoma--one to win the\r\n     ballot and the other to hold it. Mrs. Shuler remained in the\r\n     State until November 14. On that day the _Oklahoman_ printed the\r\n     statement by Governor Williams that on the face of the returns so\r\n     far suffrage had won.\r\n\r\n     Miss Beveridge, who had charge of one of the most difficult\r\n     sections of the State and had carried it, remained in Oklahoma\r\n     until December 3, when Governor Williams finally called for the\r\n     suffrage returns and without certification by the Elections\r\n     Board, proclaimed it carried. The vote stood 106,909 ayes, 81,481\r\n     noes, a majority of 25,428 votes on the amendment and of 9,791\r\n     over the total vote cast at the election. This latter requirement\r\n     had always been counted on to defeat any measure that the party\r\n     \"bosses\" did not want carried and the politicians now asked, \"But\r\n     where was the 'silent vote'?\" The answer came when a map of the\r\n     State was shown almost obliterated with tiny red stars and they\r\n     were told, \"Every star represents a suffrage committee working\r\n     since last January.\" Organization had reduced the \"silent vote\"\r\n     to five per cent. and won the suffrage for the women of Oklahoma.\r\n     [End of Mrs. Shuler's report.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. With the successful closing of the campaign the county\r\nchairmen answered the call of Mrs. Shuler to meet in Oklahoma City and\r\nformed a Ratification Committee to carry on the work of ratifying the\r\nFederal Suffrage Amendment when it should be submitted to the\r\nLegislatures. This committee was composed of Miss Katherine Pierce of\r\nOklahoma City, chairman; Mrs. A. P. Crockett of the same city,\r\ntreasurer, and Miss Aloysius Larch-Miller of Shawnee, secretary, with\r\nrepresentative women from the State at large as follows: Mrs. Frank\r\nHaskell, Tulsa; Mrs. E. E. McPherron, Durant; Mrs. Walter Ferguson,\r\nCherokee; Mrs. Robert J. Ray, Lawton; Mrs. Hardee Russell, Paul's\r\nValley. The county chairmen for the campaign were retained.\r\n\r\nNo active work was done until after the Conference of Governors in\r\nSalt Lake City in the summer of 1919, when the amendment had been\r\nsubmitted. At this conference the new Governor, J. B. A. Robertson,\r\ngave as a reason for not calling a special session to ratify, the\r\ngreat expense and the fear of untimely legislation but he consented to\r\ncall one if these could be avoided. In September Miss Larch-Miller,\r\nassisted by Miss Marjorie Shuler, sent by the National Association,\r\nasked the legislators to sign a pledge that they would attend a\r\nspecial session, serve without pay, consider no other legislation and\r\nvote for ratification. Pledges were signed by a majority of both\r\nHouses and presented to the Governor who made no answer. Several weeks\r\nlater he addressed the State Federation of Women's Clubs and again\r\noffered the same excuses.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1920, the Democratic Central Committee called county\r\nconventions of women to select delegates to a State convention of\r\nwomen to be held prior to the regular State convention. Many of these\r\ncounty conventions passed a resolution requesting the Governor to call\r\na special session and it was also adopted at the State convention of\r\nabout 1,500 women. A number of the regular county conventions of men\r\nand women passed it. Miss Larch-Miller attended the convention of her\r\ncounty, although she had been confined to her room for several days\r\nwith influenza. She spoke strongly for the resolution and was opposed\r\nby the Attorney General, S. P. Freeling, one of the ablest orators in\r\nthe State, but her enthusiasm and eloquence carried the day and it was\r\nadopted. The exertion proved too much for her frail body and the next\r\nnight pneumonia developed and she gave her young life as the supreme\r\nsacrifice for the cause she loved.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic State convention met at Muskogee February 5 and Senator\r\nRobert L. Owen's candidacy for President of the United States had\r\ndeveloped to such an extent that he was its dominating figure. He\r\ninsisted on a special session to ratify the amendment. Governor\r\nRobertson stated to the convention that because of its interest in\r\nSenator Owen's candidacy he would call the session and he did so for\r\nFebruary 23. President Wilson sent the following telegram on the 25th\r\nto the Speaker of the House: \"May I not take the liberty of expressing\r\nmy earnest hope that Oklahoma will join the other suffrage States in\r\nratifying the Federal Suffrage Amendment, thus demonstrating anew its\r\nsense of justice and retaining its place as a leader in democracy?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Rufus M. Gibbs and Mrs. Mabel G. Millard, presidents of the\r\nMaryland and Iowa Anti-Suffrage Associations, sent urgent telegrams to\r\ndefeat ratification, which were read to both Houses. Attorney General\r\nFreeling made a strong State's rights argument against it but the\r\nresolution was finally passed on February 27 by a vote of 84 to 12 in\r\nthe House and the next day in the Senate by 25 to 13. Senators Fred\r\nTucker of Ardmore and J. Elmer Thomas of Lawton sponsored it in the\r\nSenate and Paul Nesbitt of McAlester and Bert C. Hodges of Okmulgee in\r\nthe House. Governor Robertson signed it February 28. Attorney General\r\nFreeling immediately started a petition to refer this action to the\r\nvoters. The decision of the U. S. Supreme Court that there could be no\r\nreferendum of Federal Amendments ended this final effort.\r\n\r\nThe Ratification Committee, with a feeling of gratitude to the\r\nNational Suffrage Association for the generous assistance that had\r\nbeen given to Oklahoma affiliated the State with this body and it was\r\nrepresented at the next national convention by a delegation of eight.\r\n\r\nIn 1920 Mrs. Lamar Looney was elected to the State Senate; Miss Bessie\r\nMcColque to the House and Miss Alice Robertson to the Lower House of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[145] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Adelia C.\r\nStephens, president of the State Woman Suffrage Association, and Miss\r\nKatherine Pierce, chairman of the Ratification Committee.\r\n\r\n[146] History of Woman Suffrage, Volume IV, page 888.\r\n\r\n[147] The following testimonial was gratefully offered: Mrs. Ida\r\nPorter Boyer by her tact and never failing kindness not only won the\r\nlove of the suffragists of Oklahoma but the respect and confidence of\r\nall others who knew her.

With an ultra conservative population,\r\ndefeats in five previous campaigns, the existence of bitter prejudices\r\nand an utter lack of cooperation among the suffragists themselves, the\r\noutlook was almost hopeless, except for the one outstanding fact that\r\neach failure had carried the women a little nearer their goal. An\r\ninactive State organization had been maintained for years and in\r\n1901-1904 the officers were: President, Mrs. Abigail Scott Duniway;\r\nvice-president-at-large, Dr. Annice Jeffreys; vice-president, Mrs. Ada\r\nCornish Hertsche; corresponding secretary, Miss Frances Gotshall;\r\nrecording secretary, Mrs. W. H. Games; treasurer, Mrs. Henry Waldo\r\nCoe. No regular conventions were held.\r\n\r\nMrs. Duniway, the mother of suffrage in Oregon, always advocated the\r\n\"still hunt,\" preferring to centralize and individualize the effort\r\nthrough prominent men and women rather than through a large and\r\ngeneral organization. Shortly before her death in 1915, speaking of\r\nher work she said: \"Occasionally I would gather a few women together\r\nin a suffrage society but on the whole I did not find my time thus\r\nspent at all profitable. Some traveling lecturer would often come\r\nalong and after speaking before the little local band of a dozen\r\nmembers would receive the contents of the treasury, leaving the\r\nsociety to ravel out for lack of funds. These experiences led me to\r\ngive up organizing suffrage societies, as I had learned that\r\nlecturing, writing serial stories and editorials and correspondence\r\nafforded a more rational means of spreading the light.... The only\r\ntime for general, active organization is after a few devoted workers\r\nhave succeeded in using the press for getting the movement squarely\r\nbefore the voters in the shape of a proposed State suffrage\r\namendment.\"\r\n\r\nThis will answer very largely the many criticisms that came from the\r\nNational Association and from equal suffrage States over the apathy of\r\nOregon women from 1900 to 1904. What the result might have been, with\r\nthe State and national growth of suffrage sentiment, had there been a\r\nstrong, active organization is problematic, but Oregon might have had\r\nthe proud distinction of being first instead of last of the Pacific\r\nCoast States to liberate her women politically. In 1905 the following\r\nofficers were elected: Honorary president, Mrs. Duniway; president,\r\nMrs. Coe; vice-president, Dr. Jeffreys Myers; secretary, Dr. Luema G.\r\nJohnson; treasurer, Mrs. Abbie C. French; auditors, Dr. Mary Thompson,\r\nMrs. Martha Dalton and Mrs. Frederick Aggert.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature had many times submitted the amendment but its\r\nrepeated failures had discouraged the most ardent supporters in that\r\nbody. The gains in the various campaigns were not sufficient, they\r\nargued, to warrant the expense of resubmission in the near future.\r\nThis reason was freely and courageously given from the Chair of the\r\nSenate by one of the staunchest friends suffrage ever had in the\r\nState, the Hon. C. W. Fulton, when he voted \"no\" on re-submission in\r\nthe Legislature of 1899, and the defeat of 1900 intensified this\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nHope revived when the Initiative and Referendum Act was adopted by the\r\nvoters in 1902. The District Judges decided against its\r\nconstitutionality and an appeal was carried to the State Supreme Court\r\nby Attorney Ralph Duniway, whose able argument resulted in a reversal\r\nand the establishment of the legality of the new law. This decision\r\nwas rendered Dec. 22, 1903, and on Jan. 2, 1904, a suffrage petition\r\nwas issued. This required the signatures of 8 per cent. of the legal\r\nvoters of the State based on the highest number of votes cast at the\r\nelection of 1902, in round numbers 7,200 names, and compelled the\r\nsubmission of the amendment. In less than three weeks 7,900 had been\r\nobtained but as only half of them had been verified and classified\r\nbefore the limited time expired the work was of no avail.\r\n\r\nDuring the following two years another force had been contributing\r\nindirectly to the suffrage cause through the preparations for the\r\nNational Exposition which was to celebrate in Portland the Lewis and\r\nClark Expedition. In 1904 the Hon. Jefferson Myers, president of the\r\nExposition Commission, with his wife, Dr. Annice Jeffreys, attended\r\nthe convention of the National American Woman Suffrage Association at\r\nWashington, D. C., and so eloquently presented the claims of Oregon\r\nthat its unanimous decision was to hold its next meeting in Portland.\r\nStimulated by this prospect the Legislature of 1905 yielded to\r\npressure and submitted the amendment to be voted on in November, 1906.\r\n\r\nIt was a proud day for Oregon when the national convention was called\r\nto order on June 21, 1905, by Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, national\r\npresident, in the First Congregational Church. The honorary president,\r\nMiss Susan B. Anthony, then 85 years old, favored every session with\r\nher gracious presence. Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, the vice-president;\r\nMiss Alice Stone Blackwell, the recording secretary, with her father,\r\nHenry B. Blackwell; Miss Kate Gordon, corresponding secretary, and\r\nMiss Laura Clay, auditor, were present and with Mrs. Charlotte Perkins\r\nGilman, Mrs. Catharine Waugh McCulloch, Misses Gail Laughlin, Mary and\r\nLucy Anthony, Mrs. Ida Husted Harper, Mrs. Maud Wood Park and other\r\nwell known women were heard during the convention. [See Chapter V,\r\nVolume V.]\r\n\r\nVery significant of the changing sentiment toward women was the\r\nunveiling of the Sacajawea statue, in the exposition grounds, which\r\nhad been arranged for the time when these visitors could assist the\r\ncommittee in the ceremonies. Miss Anthony in the opening address paid\r\na glowing tribute to this Indian woman and exhorted the women of\r\nOregon to lead the way to women's liberty. Dr. Shaw highly\r\ncomplimented those who had made this recognition of a woman's services\r\nto her country possible and hailed it as the dawning of a new day for\r\nthe cause of woman. Brief words along these lines were spoken by Mrs.\r\nCatt and others. The picture will never fade from the memory of those\r\nwho saw Miss Anthony and Dr. Shaw standing on the platform with the\r\nsun lighting up their silver hair like an aureole and their faces\r\nradiant with hope, as \"The Star Spangled Banner\" sung by an Indian\r\nboy raised a tumult of applause while the flag floated away revealing\r\nthe idealized mother and babe.[151]\r\n\r\nThe national suffrage convention gave to the cause in Oregon a new\r\nbirth. Some of the most prominent men in the State appeared on its\r\nplatform and urged another campaign and political leaders in private\r\nconference with its officers assured them that the time was ripe for\r\nsuccess. Encouraged by this assurance and in response to the strong\r\nappeal of the leaders among the women of the State, the National\r\nAssociation pledged its support. The suffragists for the most part\r\nwere now fully convinced that if the amendment was to be carried in\r\n1906 there must be state-wide, systematic organization and in answer\r\nto their request the National Board sent to assist them two of its\r\nbest organizers, Miss Mary N. Chase and Miss Gail Laughlin. By the end\r\nof 1905 forty-two clubs had been formed in Portland and committees\r\noutside. Newspapers were giving full reports of meetings and the\r\nPortland _Journal_ was publishing each Sunday articles on suffrage by\r\nMrs. Sarah A. Evans, editor of the woman's page. At a State convention\r\nheld in Portland on November 8 the attendance was so great it was\r\nnecessary to adjourn to a larger hall. Mayor Harry Lane welcomed the\r\nconvention and took an unequivocal position in favor of woman\r\nsuffrage. Statesmanlike addresses were made by Miss Laughlin and Miss\r\nLaura Clay of Kentucky. A special Campaign Committee had been\r\norganized to cooperate with the State and national workers.[152]\r\n\r\nThe great leader of women, Susan B. Anthony, had passed away in March,\r\n1906, her thoughts on the Oregon campaign to the very last, and,\r\ncarrying out her wishes, the following group of women came at once to\r\nassist the women of the State: Dr. Shaw, Miss Clay, Miss Blackwell and\r\nMiss Gordon, national officers; her sister and niece, Miss Mary and\r\nMiss Lucy Anthony; Mrs. Ida Porter Boyer of Pennsylvania, Miss Laura\r\nGregg of Kansas, Mrs. Mary C. C. Bradford of Colorado. Miss Laughlin\r\nwas already there. Added to the able Oregon workers a more efficient\r\nbody of women never had charge of a suffrage campaign. Centrally\r\nlocated headquarters were at once opened in Portland, which soon\r\nbecame the Mecca for the suffragists from all over the State. The\r\nabove trained campaigners submitted a plan to the State board and\r\ncommittee, which was adopted. Women who had been named as county\r\nchairmen previous to 1905 by Mrs. Duniway were used when possible as a\r\nnucleus for a county organization. Many young women who took a leading\r\npart in later campaigns got their first inspiration.\r\n\r\nOne large room at headquarters was set aside in which to prepare\r\nliterature for mailing and there daily went a stream of Portland\r\nwomen, often swelled by women from out of the city, who worked\r\ndiligently from morning till night and many of them every day. These\r\nnoon hours became the social events of the campaign and many business\r\nwomen acquired the habit of dropping in to help a bit with the work\r\nand to enjoy the delightful companionship of the women they found\r\nthere. Mrs. Coe, the State president, was out of the city several\r\nmonths, returning only a few weeks before the election.\r\n\r\nAmong the women outside of Portland who put their shoulders to the\r\nwheel were Mrs. Clara Waldo, Marion county; Mrs. Emma Galloway,\r\nYamhill; Dr. Anna B. Reed, Linn; Mrs. Elizabeth Lord, Wasco; Professor\r\nHelen Crawford, Benton; Mrs. Henry Sangstacken, Coos; Mrs. Imogene\r\nBath, Washington; Mrs. Rosemary Schenck, Lincoln; Mrs. Minnie\r\nWashburn, Lane, and Mrs. Eva Emery Dye, Clackamas.\r\n\r\nMiss Clay, Mrs. Bradford and Miss Gregg supervised the work of State\r\norganization, going into large and small places and extending it into\r\nthe remotest corners. Mrs. Boyer took up the publicity, in which she\r\nhad had long experience. Miss Gordon had charge of parlor meetings in\r\nthe cities and larger towns, reaching hundreds who could not have been\r\ninduced to attend public rallies. Miss Laughlin appealed powerfully to\r\nthe labor and fraternal organizations and conducted a series of\r\nmeetings in their halls, at industrial plants and on the streets. Miss\r\nBlackwell, assisted by the Misses Mary and Lucy Anthony, remained at\r\nthe headquarters and supervised the sending out of literature. Dr.\r\nShaw, while keeping her finger on the pulse of all the work, was\r\nspeaking to great crowds constantly.\r\n\r\nThe impetus given the cause by the national convention the previous\r\nsummer and the activity of the national workers in the present\r\ncampaign aroused the corrupt influences in politics and the upper and\r\nlower classes of anti-suffragists as never before and they jointly\r\nemployed Ferdinand Reed, an experienced politician, at a high salary,\r\nas manager of a skilfully organized effort to defeat the amendment.\r\n\r\nThe Brewers' and Wholesale Liquor Dealers' Association of Oregon sent\r\nout from Portland May 21 to the retail liquor dealers and druggists\r\nthe following secret circular, printed on its official paper, headed\r\nwith the names of thirteen breweries and nineteen wholesale liquor\r\nhouses:\r\n\r\n     Dear Sir:--Two laws are to be voted on at the election June 4,\r\n     which are of vital importance to every liquor merchant in Oregon\r\n     without exception. The first is woman suffrage. The second is the\r\n     amendment to the local option law. The members of this\r\n     association have worked hard for a long time on both these\r\n     matters ... but, being few in number, they can not by themselves\r\n     pass the local option amendment or defeat woman suffrage. That\r\n     part of the work is up to the retailers. We write this letter\r\n     earnestly to ask you to help.\r\n\r\n     It will take 50,000 votes to defeat woman suffrage. It will take\r\n     50,000 votes to pass the amendment to the local option law. There\r\n     are 2,000 retailers in Oregon. That means that every retailer\r\n     must himself bring in 25 votes on election day. Every retailer\r\n     can get 25 votes. Besides his employees he has his grocer, his\r\n     butcher, his landlord, his laundryman and every person he does\r\n     business with. If every man in the business will do this we will\r\n     win.\r\n\r\n     We enclose 25 ballot tickets, showing how these two laws will\r\n     appear on the ballot and how to vote. If you will personally take\r\n     25 friendly voters to the polls on election day and give each one\r\n     a ticket showing how to vote, please mail this postal card back\r\n     to us at once. You need not sign the card. Every card has a\r\n     number and we will know who sent it in. Let us all pull together\r\n     and let us all work. Let us each get 25 votes.\r\n\r\nThe election took place June 4, 1906, and resulted in an adverse\r\nmajority of 10,173 in a vote of about 84,000. Besides the money raised\r\nin Oregon the National Suffrage Association expended on this campaign\r\n$18,075. Of this amount $3,768 were used in the preliminary work of\r\n1905. All of the eastern workers except the organizers contributed\r\ntheir services and several defrayed their own expenses.\r\n\r\nThe women decided to go immediately into another campaign. The\r\nLegislative Assembly of 1907 refused to submit the amendment and the\r\nState Association again circulated an initiative petition to have it\r\nsubmitted. Miss Clay contributed $300 toward the expense of it; Mr.\r\nand Miss Blackwell also contributed liberally and the requisite number\r\nof names was secured. Mrs. Duniway in reporting this campaign said:\r\n\"It was more like that of 1900, as only Oregon women took part and no\r\nlarge meetings were held.\" There were a few less votes in favor of the\r\namendment in 1908 than in 1906 and 11,739 more against it.\r\n\r\nThe State Association filed a petition for another initiative measure\r\nimmediately after this defeat. It was quite a different proposition,\r\nhowever, as it read: \"No citizen who is a taxpayer shall be denied the\r\nright to vote on account of sex.\" Both men and women, many of them the\r\nstaunchest suffragists, openly opposed it and it was bitterly fought\r\nby labor and fraternal organizations. No campaign was attempted except\r\nfrom the State president's office and there was general satisfaction\r\nwhen it was defeated in 1910 by a majority of 22,600.\r\n\r\nA reorganization of the State work in 1906 after the election had\r\nresulted in Mrs. Duniway's again resuming the presidency with the\r\nfollowing board: Vice-president-at-large, Mrs. Elizabeth Lord;\r\ncorresponding secretary, Mrs. Elizabeth Craig; recording secretary,\r\nMiss Emma Buckman; financial secretary, Mrs. A. Bonham; treasurer,\r\nMrs. W. E. Potter; auditors, Mrs. Frederick Eggert and Mrs. Martha\r\nDalton; honorary president, Mrs. Coe. This board practically remained\r\nintact until 1912. In the two disastrous campaigns of 1908 and 1910,\r\nagainst the protest of many, the \"still hunt\" method was employed and\r\nno state-wide organization was attempted. With indomitable courage the\r\nboard again circulated an initiative petition and had the amendment\r\nfor full suffrage put on the 1912 ballot. Although it was unnecessary\r\nfor the Legislature to vote for its submission it did so in order to\r\ngive it more weight.\r\n\r\nThe women of the State now grew restive and began to agitate for\r\norganization for the coming campaign. During 1910 and 1911 Washington\r\nand California had enfranchised their women and Oregon remained the\r\nonly \"black\" State on the Pacific Coast. This was a matter of great\r\nhumiliation to the women who had worked for suffrage at least a score\r\nof years, as well as to the progressive young women who were beginning\r\nto fill the thinning ranks of the pioneer workers.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1911, Dr. Shaw, the national president, wrote a very\r\nstrong letter to some of the women severely criticizing their apathy\r\nand lack of preparation for this campaign. This was brought to the\r\nattention of the State president, who later wrote: \"Although urged\r\nfrom many sides and by some of the ablest women of the State to begin\r\na campaign for 1912 in the summer of 1911, I withstood all such\r\nrequests.\" A division of opinion arose among the women of Portland\r\nregarding the wisdom of delay and Dr. Shaw's letter was submitted to\r\nthe Woman's Club, an organization which up to this time had taken no\r\nactive part in work for suffrage. Now a motion prevailed to enter into\r\nthe campaign and authorize the president, Mrs. A. King Wilson, to\r\nappoint a committee for this purpose. The personnel of the committee\r\nwas: Mrs. Frederick Eggert, Mrs. William Fear, Mrs. George McMillan,\r\nDr. Esther Pohl Lovejoy, Mrs. Grace Watt Ross, Mrs. Sarah A. Evans,\r\nchairman; Mrs. William Strandborg, secretary. This committee waited on\r\nthe State president and submitted a plan whereby all the various\r\ngroups of women which were forming might be co-ordinated and operate\r\nfrom one headquarters, the committee offering to assume all financial\r\nexpense for them. The plan was not approved by her and the committee\r\nand all other groups were compelled to work independently of the State\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nThe Portland Woman's Club Committee opened headquarters in January,\r\n1912, occupying two rooms in a centrally located office building for\r\nthe entire ten months of the campaign. Dr. Shaw, through the\r\ngenerosity of a friend, contributed $200 a month toward their\r\nmaintenance. Mrs. Strandborg, a newspaper woman of large experience,\r\nsent every two weeks a short, spicy letter to 210 papers throughout\r\nthe State. Many appreciative notices were given by the press.\r\n\r\nAlmost simultaneously with the opening of headquarters by this\r\ncommittee a number of independent societies were formed for\r\npropaganda, which sent out organizers and by summer there were no\r\ncounties and but few towns or hamlets without a suffrage society. With\r\nthe assistance of Miss Anita Whitney of California and Mrs. Helen Hoy\r\nGreeley of New York the women of Oregon University organized a large\r\ncollege suffrage club; the State Agricultural College did the same and\r\nthese were rapidly emulated by the smaller colleges and schools. The\r\nState Federation of Labor endorsed it and sent organizers into the\r\nfield as did many fraternal associations.\r\n\r\nThe first concerted effort made by the State Association was at Salem\r\nFeb. 16, 1912, in the Hall of Representatives by permission of\r\nSecretary of State Ben Olcott. A large number of suffragists were\r\npresent. The speakers were Governor Oswald West; Mrs. Olive English\r\nEnright; Mrs. Greeley and Miss Whitney. Mrs. Duniway became seriously\r\nill immediately after this meeting and the work of the association\r\nfell upon Mrs. Coe, who courageously assumed the responsibility. In\r\nthe secretary, Miss Buckman, she had an able assistant, and also in\r\nMrs. L. W. Therkelsen, Mrs. H. R. Reynolds, Dr. Marie D. Equi and Dr.\r\nVictoria Hampton, close friends of Mrs. Duniway. On March 8 Mrs. Coe\r\ncalled a meeting at the headquarters in the Selling Building in\r\nPortland, two rooms having been generously donated by the Hon. Ben\r\nSelling to be jointly used by the State association and the College\r\nLeague. The State work was definitely launched by the appointment of\r\nthe following committees: Finance, Mrs. J. A. Fouilhoux, Mrs. Elliott\r\nCorbet, Dr. Florence Manion; literature, Mrs. Louise Trullinger, Mrs.\r\nA. E. Clark, Miss Emma Wold, Miss Blanche Wren; ways and means, Dr.\r\nFlorence Brown Cassiday, Mrs. Caroline Hepburn, Mrs. C. B. Woodruff.\r\n\r\nIn June the General Federation of Women's Clubs met in San Francisco\r\nand many of the prominent women in attendance arranged to return via\r\nOregon, the New York special train stopping over for one day. It was\r\nmet twelve miles out and escorted to Portland and met at the depot by\r\na brass band.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon a meeting was held in the Taylor Street Methodist\r\nChurch with many unable to obtain admittance. Miss Mary Garrett Hay of\r\nNew York; Mrs. H. C. Warren of New Jersey; Mrs. Desha Breckinridge of\r\nKentucky; Miss Helen Varick Boswell and Miss Mary Wood of New York,\r\nand Professor Frances Squire Potter of Minnesota University, were\r\namong the speakers. The last four remained for several days and spoke\r\nat the great Gladstone Chautauqua. One of the most noteworthy\r\nincidents of the campaign was a debate here between Mrs. Breckinridge\r\nand the Rev. Clarence True Wilson, secretary of the Committee of\r\nTemperance and Morals for the Methodist Church. The reverend gentleman\r\nwas the white hope of the anti-suffragists. His exalted calling and\r\nhis official position as a prohibitionist, camouflaged the relation\r\nbetween the two extremes of society that were working against the\r\namendment--the liquor people and a group of society women supplemented\r\nby a group of prominent men. He had sent the challenge to the Woman's\r\nClub Committee and Mrs. Breckinridge took up the gauntlet. Three\r\nthousand people saw him, completely routed, retire from the platform\r\nwhile Mrs. Breckinridge and \"the cause\" got a tremendous ovation. Mr.\r\nWilson and William D. Wheelwright were the only two men who took the\r\nplatform against the amendment. The women \"antis\" were led by Mrs. A.\r\nE. Rockey, Mrs. Ralph Wilber, Mrs. Robert Lewis and the Misses Etta\r\nand May Failing.\r\n\r\nThe committee maintained a speakers' bureau and sent out thousands of\r\npieces of literature. Among the first to enter the campaign was a\r\nMen's Equal Suffrage Club, organized and promoted by W. M. Davis, a\r\nprominent attorney of Portland, which soon became an active state-wide\r\norganization. Mr. Davis was the legal adviser of all the women's\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\nMrs. Solomon Hirsch, an early worker and one of the most liberal\r\nfinancial supporters of the campaign, went directly into the camp of\r\nthe enemy and organized a group of society women in the Portland Equal\r\nSuffrage League. No one feature stands out more conspicuously for\r\nresults than a \"tea\" she gave for Sir Forbes-Robertson in her palatial\r\nhome, to which she invited about two hundred guests, most of whom were\r\nradical anti-suffragists, but many of them went away converts after\r\nhearing the presentation of the subject by the guest of honor. Mrs.\r\nHirsch also brought the Rev. Charles A. Aked of San Francisco.\r\n\r\nDr. Coe was the first president of the Portland College League and\r\nwhen she had to assume the duties of the State president, Miss Emma\r\nWold filled her place. The largest suffrage meeting up to that time\r\nwas under the auspices of this league at Oaks Amusement Park, where\r\nMrs. Sara Bard Field (Ergott) and C. E. S. Wood, a brilliant orator,\r\naddressed more than 10,000 people. Mrs. A. C. Newill established the\r\nCooperative Civic League, which did active work with the State\r\nassociation. Dr. Lovejoy organized Every Body's League late in the\r\ncampaign but succeeded in gathering hundreds of unattached men and\r\nwomen into the ranks of the workers. The Woman's Christian Temperance\r\nUnion added its mighty strength and did valiant service under the able\r\nleadership of Mrs. Lucia Faxton Additon, Mrs. M. L. T. Hidden and Mrs.\r\nAda Wallace Unruh.\r\n\r\nOn Nov. 5, 1912, the equal suffrage amendment was carried by a\r\nmajority of 4,161, not by any one person or by any one organization,\r\nfor no individual or single organization could have compassed the work\r\nrequired to put the State \"over the top\" with even this meagre\r\nmajority in a total vote of 118,369. When the heights were reached,\r\nhowever, all were ready to lay the laurels at the feet of Abigail\r\nScott Duniway, Martha A. Dalton, Charlotte M. Cartwright and Dr. Mary\r\nThompson, the pioneers who had borne the heat and burden of the early\r\ndays. Governor West paid Mrs. Duniway the compliment of inviting her\r\nto write the proclamation of woman suffrage and jointly with him to\r\nsign it, and John Coffey, the county clerk, carried the registration\r\nbook to her sick room so that she might be the first woman in Oregon\r\nto register.\r\n\r\nAt the close of this arduous campaign the women folded their hands for\r\na quiet rest until the cry for help came from other States. It was a\r\nmost difficult task to gather up the broken threads of so many\r\norganizations and again rouse them to enthusiasm. Dr. Lovejoy,\r\nhowever, at the earnest request of Dr. Shaw, sent out a general call\r\nfor a conference in March, 1915. At this meeting the State Suffrage\r\nAlliance was formed with Mrs. William Ogburn as first president. Those\r\nwho followed her in the office were: Mrs. Thomas Burk, Mrs. Kelley\r\nRees, Mrs. Elliott Corbett and Mrs. C. B. Simmons. It gave its\r\nassistance to the unenfranchised States and was ready to respond to\r\nany call from the national president.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. The Alliance was largely instrumental in having a\r\nspecial session of the Legislature called to ratify the Federal\r\nSuffrage Amendment. This was done by unanimous vote in the House\r\nJanuary 12 and in the Senate January 13, 1920, and Governor Oswald\r\nWest affixed his signature on the 14th. The resolution was introduced\r\nin the lower House by Mrs. Alexander Thompson, a member.\r\n\r\nOn March 6, 1920, at a called meeting the women organized a League of\r\nWomen Voters and Mrs. Charles E. Curry was elected chairman.\r\n\r\nThe Oregon chapter on suffrage was closed on Aug. 28, 1920. At noon of\r\nthat day, while nearly 300 women stood at attention around the banquet\r\ntable at the Benson Hotel in Portland, every bell and whistle in the\r\ncity sounded forth the glad refrain of liberty and righteousness,\r\nuniversal suffrage for women, proclaimed by Secretary of State\r\nBainbridge Colby. The Mayor of Portland, George L. Baker, was there to\r\nrejoice with them. Old women who had stood in the battle-front for\r\nyears were there to tell of the hard struggles they had passed through\r\nfor the franchise and young women were there to promise that they\r\nwould keep the faith and honor the inheritance that had come to them.\r\nThe jubilee closed with the singing of a Hymn of Thanksgiving written\r\nfor this meeting by Mrs. Helen Ekin Starrett, the only woman living\r\nwho had attended the first and last conventions of the National\r\nSuffrage Association--1869-1920.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[150] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Sarah A. Evans,\r\npresident of the State Federation of Clubs ten years; on the Child\r\nLabor Commission eighteen years and market inspector for Portland\r\nsixteen years.\r\n\r\n[151] Sacajawea was a young Indian woman who accompanied her husband\r\non the Lewis and Clark Expedition from the Missouri River to the\r\nPacific Coast, the only woman in the party. She had been a captive\r\nfrom an Idaho tribe of the Shoshones and was the only person who could\r\nspeak the language of the Indians that would be met on the way or who\r\nhad ever been over the route to be traveled. With her baby in her arms\r\nshe was the unerring guide through the almost impenetrable mountain\r\npasses and on several occasions saved not only the equipment and\r\ndocuments but the lives of the party. In recognition of this service\r\nthe women of Oregon formed the Sacajawea Association, with the\r\nfollowing officers: Mrs. Eva Emery Dye, president; Mrs. C. M.\r\nCartwright, first vice-president; Mrs. M. A. Dalton, second; Mrs. J.\r\nB. Montgomery, third; Mrs. Sarah A. Evans, secretary; Mrs. A. H.\r\nBreyman, treasurer. This association secured subscriptions and erected\r\na beautiful bronze statue on the exposition grounds, which later was\r\ntransferred to a prominent place in the city park.\r\n\r\n[152] Campaign Committee: Mrs. Henry Waldo Coe, chairman, president of\r\nthe Equal Suffrage Association; Mrs. Duniway, honorary president; Dr.\r\nAnnice Jeffreys Myers, its vice-president and auditor of the National\r\nAssociation; Mrs. Sarah A. Evans, president State Federation of\r\nWomen's Clubs; Mrs. Lucia F. Additon, president Woman's Christian\r\nTemperance Union; Mrs. C. M. Cartwright, State Pioneers' Association;\r\nMrs. Clara Waldo, State Grange; Dr. Luema G. Johnson, State Labor\r\nOrganization; Mrs. Eva Emery Dye, Sacajawea Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nPENNSYLVANIA.[153]\r\n\r\n\r\nPennsylvania was a pioneer State in the movement for woman suffrage.\r\nOne of the first \"woman's rights\" conventions in history took place in\r\n1852 in West Chester under the auspices of the Friends, or Quakers,\r\nand Philadelphia was the home of Lucretia Mott, who joined with\r\nElizabeth Cady Stanton in 1848 in calling the first \"woman's rights\"\r\nmeeting ever held. The State Woman Suffrage Association was formed in\r\nthis city in December, 1869, a few months after the founding of the\r\nNational Association, and did not cease its work until the final\r\nvictory in 1920.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lucretia L. Blankenburg of Philadelphia was reelected to the\r\npresidency in 1901 for the tenth consecutive term and was reelected\r\nannually six times thereafter, retiring in 1908 because the work then\r\nrequired long journeys from home. Auxiliaries had been organized in 11\r\ncounties before the convention held in Philadelphia, Nov. 26, 1901.\r\nSuffrage activities had been confined to southeastern Pennsylvania but\r\nnow three extreme western counties and two central ones had\r\norganizations and offered a promising field. For the first time plans\r\nwere made for extended canvassing for members. To the courageous women\r\nof that period who carried on steadfastly under severe handicaps and\r\nwith little encouragement may be attributed much of the inspiration of\r\nthe suffragists of later years. Miss Jane Campbell of Germantown,\r\npoet, author and orator, president for many years of the large, active\r\nPhiladelphia County Society, was responsible in a great degree for the\r\nenthusiasm and spirit which sustained the pioneers.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1902 took place in Philadelphia November 7. A\r\nreport on the canvassing of one ward of Philadelphia, the 10th, showed\r\n55 per cent. of the women in favor. Leaflets were sent to 2,184\r\nschools during the year and a prize offered for the best essay on\r\nwoman suffrage by a pupil. On December 5 the Philadelphia Yearly\r\nMeeting of Friends organized an Equal Rights Association.\r\n\r\nA report on the canvass of the 15th ward, undertaken by the county\r\nsociety, the largest and most active auxiliary, was given at the\r\nannual convention held in Philadelphia, Nov. 7, 1903, and showed that\r\nof the 4,839 women interviewed nearly one-half were favorable, less\r\nthan a third opposed and the rest were indifferent. This year the\r\nState Grange and the city Labor Union endorsed woman suffrage. A\r\nbanquet in honor of Miss Susan B. Anthony and the other national\r\nofficers took place at the New Century Club, the guests including\r\nMayor Samuel Ashbridge and his wife. His progressiveness contrasts\r\nstrongly with the fact that sixteen years later the suffragists were\r\nunable to persuade Mayor Thomas B. Smith to welcome their Fiftieth\r\nAnnual Convention to the city.\r\n\r\nEaston was the place of the convention, Nov. 3-5, 1904, where it was\r\nreported that the result of sending fraternal delegates to\r\nthirty-seven State gatherings was the adoption of woman suffrage\r\nresolutions by nineteen. The convention of 1905 was held in\r\nPhiladelphia, November 14, and all auxiliaries reported large gains in\r\nmembership. This year suffragists had ably assisted the City Party in\r\na reform campaign and advanced their own cause. Kennett Square\r\nentertained the convention Nov. 6-8, 1906. An increase of 1,182 in\r\nmembership had been made during the year. In 1907 the State convention\r\nwas held in the western part of the State, taking place in Pittsburgh,\r\nNovember 6-8. A resolution was proposed for the first time to ask the\r\npolitical parties to put woman suffrage planks in their State\r\nplatforms by Miss Charlotte Jones but it was voted down as\r\nimpracticable. The State Grange, Letter Carriers' Association and\r\nState Woman's Christian Temperance Union adopted suffrage resolutions\r\nduring the year. A junior suffrage auxiliary of 400 Pittsburgh girls\r\nand boys was represented.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rachel Foster Avery succeeded Mrs. Blankenburg as president at\r\nthe convention held in Norristown Nov. 4-6, 1908. The proposed program\r\nof the National American Association to secure an enormous petition\r\ncalling upon Congress to submit a woman suffrage amendment was\r\nundertaken cheerfully, although it was a heavy task for a small group\r\nof workers with no headquarters and limited finances. The State\r\nconvention took place at Newton Nov. 22-24, 1909, and Mrs. Avery was\r\nre-elected president. The Equal Franchise Society, representing a\r\ngroup of prominent women of Philadelphia, had been organized in the\r\nspring as an auxiliary of the State association and the increase of\r\nwork caused by advance throughout the State made the establishment of\r\nheadquarters imperative. A committee was appointed to arrange for\r\nState and county headquarters in Philadelphia and a sum sufficient to\r\nsustain them for three years was pledged.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1910 was held in Harrisburg and Mrs. Ellen H. E.\r\nPrice of Philadelphia assumed the presidency. This year was organized\r\nthe Equal Franchise Federation of Western Pennsylvania, later changed\r\nto Federation of Pittsburgh, its leaders destined to play a very\r\nimportant part in suffrage annals. Julian Kennedy was the first\r\npresident, one of the very few men who served as president of a woman\r\nsuffrage organization. The State Federation of Labor not only adopted\r\nresolutions endorsing woman suffrage but pledging itself to select men\r\nfor offices who were committed to a belief in it. The political\r\ndistrict plan was adopted for future work, in accordance with the\r\nrecommendation of the National Association. The headquarters were\r\nopened at 208 Hale Building, Philadelphia, October 7. Street meetings\r\nwere inaugurated in that city the next summer and the speakers were\r\nreceived with amazing cordiality. Mrs. Price was re-elected president\r\nat the convention which opened in the Mayor's reception room, City\r\nHall, Philadelphia, Nov. 23, 1911, Mayor John E. Reyburn granting this\r\ncourtesy.\r\n\r\nOwing to the necessity of giving the work state-wide scope the\r\nconvention held in Philadelphia Nov. 26, 27, 1912, recommended moving\r\nthe State headquarters to Harrisburg and this change was effected in\r\nDecember. In March a Men's League for Woman Suffrage had been\r\norganized with Judge Dimner Beeber of Philadelphia as president and\r\nmore than 100 prominent members enrolled. Fourteen new organizations\r\nwere formed during the year but the larger part of the State was still\r\nunorganized. The national suffrage convention preceded the State\r\nconvention and gave an impetus to the movement. An evening mass\r\nmeeting in the Metropolitan Opera House made the record of the largest\r\nand most enthusiastic suffrage meeting ever held in this city. [See\r\nChapter XII, Volume V.] The association now had 7,211 members. Mrs.\r\nFrank M. Roessing of Pittsburgh was elected president and this young,\r\npractical woman was principally responsible for changing the character\r\nof the work from purely propagandistic lines to recognized business\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\nThe annual convention met in Pittsburgh, Oct. 28-30, 1913, the\r\npresident's term of office was lengthened to two years and Mrs.\r\nRoessing was reelected. The State Grange and the Federation of Labor\r\nreaffirmed their suffrage resolutions and the International\r\nBrotherhood of Firemen went on record in favor. A proposition to\r\nsubmit the question of woman suffrage to the voters had been favorably\r\npassed on by the Legislature and waited action by a second.\r\n\r\nGreat strides were made in 1914. A press department conducted along\r\nprofessional lines supplied all the papers of the State with live\r\nsuffrage news and there were suffrage editions of several papers. Miss\r\nHannah J. Patterson of Pittsburgh had charge of organizing the Woman\r\nSuffrage Party along political lines out of the State association, and\r\nto Mrs. Roessing and her belongs especial credit for the strong,\r\nworkable organization which was built up so carefully in preparation\r\nfor the campaign year. The State convention was held in Scranton,\r\nNovember 19-24. There was every indication that the next Legislature\r\nwould submit a constitutional amendment and the Executive Board asked\r\nfor a campaign fund of $100,000, of which $30,000 were pledged at the\r\nconvention. Mrs. William Thaw, Jr., of Pittsburgh offered $10,000 if\r\nthe fund reached $50,000 by April 1. With this splendid foundation the\r\nState was ready to take up the actual work of the campaign in 1915.\r\nMrs. Charles Wister Ruschenberger of Strafford announced that she\r\nwould have a replica cast of the Liberty Bell to be known as the\r\n\"woman's liberty bell.\" Later Dr. Mary M. Wolfe of Lewisburg was\r\nelected chairman of the Finance Committee and the $50,000 were raised\r\non time.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of 1915 submitted an amendment to be voted on at the\r\nregular election November 2. Mrs. Roessing was president of the State\r\nAssociation and Miss Patterson was chairman of the Woman Suffrage\r\nParty, whose plan provided for organization by political districts,\r\nrecognizing every political division from that of the State unit down\r\nto the precinct and township. The State was divided into nine\r\ndistricts but as very few women could give sufficient time to head a\r\ndivision comprising from seven to ten counties, only four were\r\nsupervised by chairmen--Mrs. Anna M. Orme, Mrs. E. E. Kiernan, Mrs.\r\nMaxwell K. Chapman and Miss Mary J. Norcross.\r\n\r\nAllegheny county had four experienced organizers, Philadelphia four,\r\nMontgomery three, Bucks two, Chester, Washington, Luzerne and McKean\r\neach one. Eighteen other organizers worked under the supervision of\r\nMiss Patterson.[154] They visited every one of the 67 counties during\r\nthe year, formed new organizations, stimulated those already\r\nestablished, conducted booths at county fairs, addressed women's\r\nclubs, teachers' institutes, Chautauquas, picnics, farmers'\r\ninstitutes, men's organizations, political, church, college and\r\nfactory meetings. During the last three months of the campaign they\r\nconducted county tours and held open air meetings daily. They formed\r\ncentral organizations in 64 counties under competent chairmen. Cameron\r\nand Pike were the only counties where there were no societies but in\r\nCameron there were active workers. In the other eleven counties\r\ncentral organizations were not formed but legislative districts and\r\nboroughs were organized, each with a capable chairman.[155]\r\n\r\nTo Miss Clarissa A. Moffitt, its secretary, belongs much credit for\r\nthe able management of the Speakers' Bureau. During the campaign year\r\n56 counties were supplied, involving the services of 64 speakers; 14\r\nwere men, 33 were Pennsylvanians, 14 contributed services and expenses\r\nand 27 asked expenses only. The bureau made a study of the\r\ncharacteristics of each county in industry, agriculture, character of\r\npopulation and politics. Speakers were then offered who would be\r\nacceptable to the community as well as to the particular meeting. Dr.\r\nAnna Howard Shaw, national president, gave 28 lectures and from every\r\ncounty reports came that hundreds of converts were made.\r\n\r\nThe manager of the publicity department, Charles T. Heaslip, was an\r\nexpert not only in the art of journalism but also in the art of\r\npublicity. This department ultimately required the full time of three\r\nspecial writers. Semi-monthly a two column plate service was sent to\r\n260 papers from February and from October 1 it was weekly, the list of\r\npapers having grown to 346. Allegheny county, in which Pittsburgh is\r\nlocated, conducted the most efficient county campaign. Its\r\nheadquarters practically duplicated the State headquarters at\r\nHarrisburg with secretaries and organizers and it was the only one\r\nwhich employed its own publicity agent. A weekly news bulletin was\r\nissued to 500 papers and the regular service was supplemented by\r\nspecial stories. Much work was done in advance of meetings. From July\r\nto November a weekly cartoon service was undertaken, a new feature in\r\nsuffrage campaign work. According to the newspaper men it comprised\r\nthe best cartoons ever used in any campaign in the State and the money\r\nspent for them brought greater returns than that for any other\r\nfeature. The cartoonists were C. Batchelor, Charles H. Winner and\r\nWalter A. Sinclair.\r\n\r\nIn special features the publicity department avoided sensationalism.\r\nSuffrage Flower Gardens, Good Roads Day, the Justice Bell and\r\nSupplication Day comprised practically the entire list. Attractive\r\nyellow boxes containing seeds for the old-fashioned yellow flowers\r\nwere offered for sale by the State association and the flower gardens\r\nfurnished a picturesque form of propaganda and long continued\r\npublicity. In Pennsylvania a day in the spring is set aside by the\r\ndepartment of highways when all residents along country roads are\r\nasked to contribute their services for their improvement. The local\r\nsuffrage organizations provided coffee and sandwiches for the\r\nlaborers and got in their propaganda. On Supplication Day, the last\r\nSunday before election, ministers were asked to preach suffrage\r\nsermons. Mrs. Ruschenberger's Bell was the best and main publicity\r\nfeature and undeniably secured many thousands of votes. It visited all\r\nthe counties, traveling 3,935 miles on a special truck. Hundreds of\r\nappeals by as many speakers were made from this as a stand and it was\r\nreceived in the rural communities with almost as much reverence and\r\nceremony as would have been accorded the original bell. The\r\ncollections and the receipts from the sale of novelties moulded in the\r\nlikeness of the bell helped materially to defray the heavy expense of\r\noperating the truck, paying the speakers' expenses and providing\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nSpace for the display of advertising cards was purchased in 5,748\r\nstreet cars for August, September and October. Special suffrage\r\neditions of newspapers in all parts of the State, copy and cuts for\r\nwhich were prepared by the State Publicity Department, contributed\r\nconsiderably to propaganda and finance. Throughout the State the\r\ngeneral lines of activity were the same--meetings of all kinds,\r\nparades, hearings before organizations to secure endorsements, booths\r\nat county fairs, exhibitions, canvassing, circularization and auto\r\ntours. The degree of success in each locality depended upon the kind\r\nand amount of work. Millions of fliers, leaflets and booklets original\r\nto Pennsylvania were issued in English, Italian, German, Polish and\r\nHebrew and no effort or expense was spared to secure converts through\r\nthe written word. During the last month of the campaign the county\r\norganizations circularized their voters twice--once with speeches of\r\nRepresentatives Mondell of Wyoming and Keating of Colorado in Congress\r\nand once with a personal letter written to the voter and signed by the\r\ncounty chairman or a suffragist in his own community. Four days before\r\nelection 330,000 of these letters went to the voters.\r\n\r\nAlthough a bill for woman watchers at the polls failed to pass the\r\nLegislature and the suffragists were thus denied the protection which\r\nevery political party is permitted, yet in many counties the\r\nassistance of the regularly appointed watchers was secured. The\r\nWashington party and Socialist watchers were universally helpful and\r\nin many cases the Democratic and Republican watchers gave assistance.\r\nThe suffrage organizations were urged to place women workers at every\r\npolling precinct. Many men favorable to suffrage advised against this\r\nplan but the result of the election showed that nothing won as many\r\nvotes at the last minute as the appeal of the women at the polls. Of\r\nthe 33 counties which were carried 21 had women working at the polls;\r\nof the 36 which lost only six had women there. Of the 33 counties 17\r\nhad headquarters.\r\n\r\nEight of the 33 counties which gave a majority are chiefly industrial;\r\neight are equally industrial and rural and seventeen are chiefly\r\nrural. Luzerne, Lackawanna and Westmoreland are the third, fourth and\r\nfifth counties in point of population and they won by majorities of\r\n3,139, 2,654 and 1,140. In all of them the labor vote is heavy, as\r\nmining is the chief industry. Allegheny was the first county of its\r\nsize to be carried in the history of suffrage. Fayette county, the\r\nhome of Republican State Chairman Crow, who never wavered in his\r\nopposition, was carried by 1,400. Every ward in Uniontown, the county\r\nseat and his home, gave a majority for the amendment. Mrs. Robert E.\r\nUmbel was county chairman. The eight Dutch counties lost by majorities\r\nranging from 2,000 to 7,000. Rockbound conservatism had much to do\r\nwith this result. Schuylkill county, where an adverse vote from 10,000\r\nto 15,000 was predicted, lost by only 1,000. Miss Helen Beddall, the\r\nchairman, conducted a persistent campaign of education for two years.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia had the most difficult problem to face with its large\r\nvote and political corruption. Its difficulties were increased by the\r\nduplication of suffrage organizations working independently. An added\r\ncomplication was the prejudice created by the efforts of the\r\n\"militant\" suffrage organization, then called the Congressional Union,\r\nto organize, this being the only center in the State in which they had\r\nsecured a foothold. The large women's clubs of Philadelphia took no\r\npart in the constructive work of the campaign. Wilmer Atkinson of this\r\ncity, editor and owner of the _Farm Journal_, was president of the\r\nMen's League for Woman Suffrage and gave unstintingly of his strength\r\nand means to secure victory. The vote in Philadelphia was 122,519\r\nnoes, 77,240 ayes; adverse majority, 45,279. The total vote was\r\n826,382; in favor, 385,348; opposed, 441,034; lost by 55,686 votes,\r\nonly 10,407 more than the majority in Philadelphia. The amendment\r\nreceived nearly 47 per cent. of the total vote cast on it.\r\n\r\nPrior to election day all the political parties in the State had\r\nendorsed woman suffrage per se, except the Republican and that party\r\nhad declared in favor of a referendum to the voters. The great\r\nweakness of the campaign was lack of money. The total State fund was\r\n$78,698, of which Allegheny county contributed 50 per cent. Many of\r\nthe counties spent considerable sums in addition, Allegheny county's\r\nspecial \"budget\" being $25,000. If the association had had an\r\nadditional $25,000 the lacking 3 per cent. of the voters could have\r\nbeen secured and the campaign would have ended in a victory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe State convention was held in Philadelphia Nov. 30, 1915. As\r\namendments to the State constitution can be submitted only once in\r\nfive years, the delegates reconsecrated themselves to a new campaign\r\nat the end of that time. At a conference held in Harrisburg in the\r\nspring of 1916 47 counties were represented and an inspiring address\r\nwas made by Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, now national president. An\r\nintercounty rally at Somerset in July was attended by 500 suffragists\r\nfrom ten counties and a State suffrage flag was adopted. The annual\r\nconvention was held in Williamsport, November 21-24, and the delegates\r\nwere unanimous in their desire to continue preparations for another\r\ncampaign. Mrs. George B. Orlady was elected president.\r\n\r\nAs Philadelphia is the center of population in the State, the\r\nfinancial center, has the largest number of newspapers and is more\r\naccessible than Harrisburg, State headquarters were moved to that city\r\nJune 1, 1917. Upon the entrance of the United States into the World\r\nWar the association without a day's delay offered the services of its\r\nmembers and the facilities of its organization to the Government.\r\nState officers, county chairmen and suffragists in the ranks served on\r\nthe Council of National Defense, on Liberty Loan Committees, in the\r\nvarious \"drives\" and wherever needed. Mrs. John O. Miller, State\r\nvice-president, was appointed by Secretary of the Treasury McAdoo a\r\nmember of the National Woman's Liberty Loan Committee and also served\r\nas State Chairman. Pennsylvania contributed $20,573 to the Women's\r\nOversea Hospitals, maintained by the National Suffrage Association,\r\n$11,397 of which were raised in Pittsburgh at an outdoor fête of which\r\nMrs. Leonard G. Wood was chairman. The State convention was held in\r\nthis city November 20-22 and Mrs. Miller was elected president. In the\r\nhope that the U. S. Senate would submit the Federal Suffrage Amendment\r\nthe convention for 1918 was delayed from month to month and finally\r\nwas held in Philadelphia April 9, 10, 1919. Mrs. Miller was\r\nre-elected. On November 10, 11, the amendment having been submitted,\r\nthe 51st and last State convention was held in Philadelphia.[156] The\r\nhistoric Pennsylvania Woman Suffrage Association was disbanded and the\r\nLeague of Women Citizens was organized, to become the League of Women\r\nVoters when the women of Pennsylvania were enfranchised. This name was\r\nadopted Nov. 18, 1920, and Mrs. Miller was elected chairman for two\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. After a lapse of 26 years a second attempt was\r\nmade in 1911 under Mrs. Anna M. Orme, as legislative chairman, to\r\nsecure a resolution to refer to the voters a woman suffrage amendment\r\nto the State constitution. The Joint Committee of the Judiciary, to\r\nwhich it was referred, after giving a hearing to the suffragists, sent\r\nit to a special commission which had been appointed to revise the\r\nelection laws.\r\n\r\n1912. Miss Lida Stokes Adams was legislative chairman when this\r\ncommission gave an all day hearing March 22 at City Hall,\r\nPhiladelphia, but took no action. This hearing was preceded by a mass\r\nmeeting on the 20th in Witherspoon Hall. An effort was made to get an\r\nendorsement from the State political conventions. Miss Mary E.\r\nBakewell of the Western Equal Franchise Federation appeared before the\r\nRepublican convention May 1; Mrs. Mabel Cronise Jones, Miss Adams and\r\nMiss Bakewell addressed the Democratic convention May 7, and both gave\r\napproval. The Keystone and Prohibition party conventions also heard\r\nsuffrage speakers and adopted favorable resolutions. For the first\r\ntime all of the 880 candidates for the Legislature were interviewed by\r\na letter as to submitting the question to the voters and 283 gave\r\naffirmative answers.\r\n\r\n1913. This year the referendum measure passed after a bitter contest.\r\nTwice when the resolution came up in the Senate the motion to postpone\r\nwas avoided on a tie vote by Lieutenant Governor Reynolds, the first\r\ntime in thirteen years that the president of the Senate had voted on\r\nany question. On the final vote the majority of one was only secured\r\nby the labor leader, Steve McDonald of Lackawanna county, who forced\r\nits Senator, Walter McNichols, to represent his constituents. Senators\r\nEdwin M. Herbst, Edward E. Beidleman (later Lieutenant Governor) and\r\nJames P. McNichol maintained the strongest opposition. Miss Adams, the\r\nlegislative chairman, and Mrs. Roessing, the State president, did the\r\ngreater part of the work at Harrisburg. The association was indebted\r\nto Representative Frank G. Rockwell and Senator A. W. Powell for their\r\nskill in handling this measure. The vote in the Lower House, February\r\n5 was 131 ayes, 70 noes.\r\n\r\n1915. A proposed amendment to the constitution must be passed by two\r\nLegislatures. Mrs. Roessing and Miss Hannah J. Patterson, organization\r\nchairman, carried on the lobby work in 1915 and it passed the House on\r\nFebruary 9 by 130 ayes, 71 noes. In the Senate on March 15 a great\r\ngain was registered, as 37 Senators voted aye and only 11 voted no.\r\nThe amendment was defeated at the election in November.\r\n\r\n1916. The passage of an Enabling Act by the Legislature of 1917 being\r\nthe first step toward a referendum in 1921, the work of the State\r\nSuffrage Association in 1916 was concentrated as never before on the\r\nlegislative candidates. Practically every one was interviewed\r\npersonally or by letter and before the November election reports on 40\r\nof the 50 Senators and all but ten of the 207 members of the House\r\nhad been made. Senator Boies Penrose was visited in Washington by Mrs.\r\nGeorge B. Orlady and Mrs. John O. Miller, president and vice-president\r\nof the State Suffrage Association. He said he would help and\r\nauthorized these officers to quote him in the public press. On October\r\n9 the Republican State Committee meeting in Philadelphia refused a\r\nhearing to the Suffrage Board and took no action, despite the\r\nfavorable assurances of Senator Penrose and of State Senator William\r\nE. Crow, its chairman. On December 28 Governor Martin G. Brumbaugh\r\npromised Mrs. Miller to secure the passage of the desired Enabling\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n1917. Mrs. Miller led the work when the Legislature convened in\r\nJanuary, 1917, and Mrs. Antoinette Funk, Mrs. Lewis L. Smith and Mrs.\r\nHarriet L. Hubbs were members of the Legislative Committee. County\r\nchairmen of the suffrage association brought continuous pressure on\r\ntheir legislators; 270 powerful labor organizations in the State\r\nsigned petitions with their official seal and a petition with the\r\nnames of 56,000 individual men and women was unrolled on the floor of\r\nthe House. Every legislator received a special petition signed by 445\r\nof the most prominent men in the State, a copy of Dr. Shaw's\r\nbiography, the Story of a Pioneer, and weekly copies of the _Woman's\r\nJournal_. Mrs. Funk had an interview with Senator Penrose at\r\nWashington with one of the most prominent members of the Republican\r\nparty present. The Enabling Act was introduced in the House early in\r\nJanuary but at the request of Senator Penrose the vote was delayed\r\nfrom time to time and finally took place April 17. The preceding day\r\n121 men were listed as favorable, 104 being the required\r\nconstitutional majority. When the vote was taken only 101 answered\r\n\"aye.\"\r\n\r\nForty-eight hours before the vote the liquor lobby, represented by\r\nNeil Bonner, David Hardy, James P. Mulvihill and George W. Boyd, made\r\na concentrated effort to defeat the measure. It was understood that\r\n150 men were employed for this purpose and that the pressure brought\r\nupon the legislators was tremendous. Although other lobbyists had been\r\ndenied the privilege of going on the floor of the House Mr. Boyd was\r\nalways permitted to do so and he announced to Mrs. Funk a few minutes\r\nbefore the vote was taken that he had the bill defeated by six votes.\r\nSpeaker Richard J. Baldwin moved a verification of the roll\r\nimmediately in order that no man voting in the affirmative could\r\nchange his vote and ask for a reconsideration. A bill granting\r\nPresidential suffrage to women was introduced in the House May 28 but\r\nnever reported from committee. From 1913 to 1917, Robert K. Young,\r\nState Treasurer, rendered inestimable assistance by the closest\r\ncooperation with the Legislative Committees.\r\n\r\n1918. Plans were at once made for continuing the effort. In 1918 the\r\norganization carried out a most efficient plan of interviewing every\r\nlegislative candidate before the primaries on two questions: (1) Will\r\nyou vote to ratify the Federal Suffrage Amendment? (2) Will you vote\r\nto submit to the voters an amendment to the constitution enfranchising\r\nthe women of this State? After the November election 80 members of the\r\nHouse of Representatives for 1919 were favorably pledged in writing on\r\nboth questions and 40 had given verbal pledges--16 more than the\r\nconstitutional majority required. From the Senate 13 written and 18\r\nverbal pledges had been secured, 5 more than necessary. There was\r\npractically no organized opposition to the referendum and probably\r\nmany of the men who pledged themselves to vote for ratification felt\r\nthat the Federal Amendment would not pass Congress. The gubernatorial\r\ncandidates also had been followed up carefully. William C. Sproul and\r\nJ. Denny O'Neil, of the rival Republican factions, both said in\r\ninterviews and through the public press that they were ready to work\r\nfor any measure which would ensure suffrage to Pennsylvania women.\r\nJudge Eugene C. Bonniwell, the Democratic candidate, did not answer\r\nany inquiries.\r\n\r\n1919. Upon the defeat of the Federal Amendment in the U. S. Senate\r\nFebruary 10, Governor Sproul, who had given many proofs of his\r\nfriendship, was consulted regarding the advisability of introducing\r\nPresidential suffrage or a referendum or both. At first he recommended\r\nboth but 24 hours later word came that the former could not be passed\r\nbut the \"organization\" would sponsor a referendum. A resolution for\r\nthis was introduced and after a public hearing, at which anti-suffrage\r\nwomen from New Jersey and New York spoke at length, the House passed\r\nit on April 22 by 128 ayes, 66 noes. In the Senate on May 26 the vote\r\nstood 41 ayes, 7 noes. Mrs. William Ward, Jr., of Chester,\r\nvice-chairman of the Legislative Committee, managed a large part of\r\nthe work for it.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. The Legislative Committee held its organization intact\r\nawaiting the submission of the Federal Amendment, which took place\r\nJune 4, 1919. Although this committee was in Harrisburg continuously\r\nfrom January 6 to June 24 and knew the personnel of the Legislature\r\nbetter than any others except some of the political leaders, members\r\nof the National Woman's Party came to Harrisburg early in June, the\r\nfirst time they had ever been seen there, and tried to create the\r\nimpression that they inaugurated the work on ratification. A\r\ndelegation from the State Suffrage Association visited Senator Penrose\r\nin Washington on June 5. Although he was paired against the amendment\r\nhe was asked to offer no opposition to ratification. He was\r\nnon-committal but the committee felt that Republican opposition had\r\nbeen removed.\r\n\r\nOn June 8 the Legislative Committee began an intensive campaign. Mrs.\r\nGifford Pinchot telephoned or telegraphed Chairman Hays and all the\r\nmembers of the National Republican Committee; also all Republican\r\nGovernors and other prominent Republicans, asking them to communicate\r\nwith Governor Sproul, Senator Penrose and State Chairman Crow urging\r\nratification as a Republican measure. All editors of influential\r\nRepublican papers east of the Mississippi River received the same\r\nappeal. The Governor advised that the resolution should not be\r\nintroduced in the Senate until Chairman Crow had decided to get behind\r\nit. On June 16 the latter told Mrs. Miller that the road was clear and\r\nit would come to a vote June 19. The vote stood 31 ayes, 6 noes. The\r\nHouse voted on June 24, giving 153 ayes, 44 noes.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the vote in the House the work of the State\r\nassociation was recognized when Representative Robert L. Wallace, a\r\nfriend in many Legislatures, moved to give its president the privilege\r\nof addressing the House from the Speaker's rostrum. This was the first\r\ntime it ever was granted to any man or woman. Governor Sproul also\r\ngave a special reception to the officers of the association and the\r\n500 women who had journeyed to Harrisburg for the ratification. For a\r\nnumber of years, the State Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage had\r\nbeen represented at all sessions of the Legislature by Mrs. Horace\r\nBrock, the president, Mrs. John B. Heron and Miss Eliza Armstrong of\r\nPittsburgh, but to Miss Armstrong, a woman of seventy, it had been\r\nleft to fight the last battle on ratification and fifty legislators\r\nsupported her efforts to the end.\r\n\r\nThe example of the big Republican State of Pennsylvania unquestionably\r\naided in securing like action in a large number of other Republican\r\nStates. Its prompt action may be attributed primarily to Governor\r\nSproul's sincere interest but due credit must be given to all the\r\nbrave women who toiled for more than half a century to keep the torch\r\nburning and to the leaders in the last years, especially Mrs. John O.\r\nMiller, the president. The newspapers, from the editorial departments\r\nto the youngest reporters, were always of the greatest assistance and\r\nit was highly appreciated.\r\n\r\n[LAWS. A complete digest of the laws relating especially to women and\r\nchildren accompanied this chapter, comprising about 3,600 words and\r\nincluding the laws for women in the industries, child labor,\r\njurisdiction of the Juvenile Courts, property rights of wives,\r\nguardianship of children, divorce, mothers' pensions and others.

Some of those who\r\nwere charter members when the organization was formed in 1868 were in\r\nactive service, enriching the work by their wide experience in the\r\npast and clear vision for the future. Mrs. Ardelia Cooke Dewing, a\r\nwoman of unusual ability, had taken the presidency at the death of\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Buffum Chace in 1899 and continued in the office until\r\n1905. The association never failed to hold an annual convention in the\r\nautumn in Providence, where reside about half the population of the\r\nState. In 1901, the usual propaganda was conducted by public and\r\nparlor meetings, the circulation of literature and the May banquet,\r\nfor years a regular social function. A special impetus was given this\r\nyear by the presence of Miss Susan B. Anthony at the convention. The\r\nfollowing morning she addressed the students of the Woman's College of\r\nBrown University.\r\n\r\nOn June 2, 1902, the endorsement of the State Central Trades and Labor\r\nUnions was secured. Harry Parsons Cross, a leading lawyer, gave two\r\ncourses of lectures on the Legal Status of Women and Parent and Child\r\nin Common Law. This year the organization met with a great loss in the\r\nremoval from Rhode Island of the Rev. Anna Garlin Spencer, who had\r\nserved the society from its inception, officially and unofficially,\r\nwith signal devotion. Henry B. Blackwell gave a notable address at the\r\nannual meeting. To him, Lucy Stone and Alice Stone Blackwell the State\r\nassociation was indebted for invaluable services on many important\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\nIn 1903, at the annual meeting a letter was read from Mayor D. L. D.\r\nGranger of Providence, heartily endorsing woman suffrage. Mrs.\r\nCharlotte B. Wilbour and the Rev. Mrs. Spencer were made honorary\r\npresidents of the association. In 1904 and thereafter a prize of $25\r\nfrom the Elizabeth Buffum Chace legacy was given for the best essay on\r\nwoman suffrage written by a student of the Woman's College. Mrs.\r\nDewing declined re-election in 1905 and Mrs. Jeannette S. French was\r\nchosen president, serving two years. Events of the year were two\r\nlectures by Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, president of the National American\r\nSuffrage Association. In 1906 Mrs. Mary F. W. Homer was elected\r\ncorresponding secretary and her wide experience in suffrage work in\r\nMassachusetts was a valued contribution at a time when re-enforcements\r\nwere greatly needed.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 Mrs. Rowena P. B. Tingley was elected president. Mrs. Julia\r\nWard Howe, in her 88th year, gave a remarkable address in April. The\r\nassociation secured an endorsement of woman suffrage and equal pay for\r\nequal work by the United Textile Workers of America, who met in\r\nProvidence. Mrs. George D. Gladding, daughter of Mrs. Dewing, was\r\nappointed chairman of the Committee on College Work and initiated the\r\nmovement for the College Equal Suffrage League by securing Mrs. Maud\r\nWood Park to address a meeting of college women at the home of Mrs.\r\nDewing and also to speak at the Woman's College. The league was\r\norganized December 11.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 Mrs. Tingley was re-elected president but because of ill\r\nhealth the duties of the office devolved largely upon Mrs. Gladding,\r\nfirst vice-president. The 40th anniversary of the association was\r\ncelebrated December 11 in Churchill House, the women's club house,\r\nnamed for one of the distinguished suffrage pioneers, Mrs. Elizabeth\r\nKittridge Churchill. Mrs. Tingley, Arnold B. Chace, Mr. Blackwell and\r\nthe Rev. Mrs. Spencer, the speakers on this occasion, had been present\r\nwhen the association was formed and they added to the pleasure of the\r\nmeeting with personal reminiscences. Miss Florence Garvin, president\r\nof the College Equal Suffrage League, spoke of the debt of the young\r\nwomen to the pioneer suffragists. The State association enrolled\r\nthousands of names for the National Association's petition to Congress\r\nin behalf of the Federal Amendment and used its influence to obtain\r\nfor it the support of the Rhode Island members of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn 1909 at the annual meeting Miss Elizabeth Upham Yates, who had\r\nrecently come to the State, was elected president. This year was\r\nmarked by distinctive propaganda through the efforts of Mrs. Oliver H.\r\nP. Belmont of New York. The lectures given at Marble Palace, her home\r\nin Newport, by Dr. Shaw and Professor Charles Zueblin interested a new\r\nand influential class and gave a substantial impetus to suffrage work\r\nthroughout the State. Increasing calls to discuss the question before\r\nclubs, granges, church societies and other organizations were an\r\nencouraging sign of a popular awakening to its importance.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 a debate on woman suffrage between Brown University and\r\nWilliams College was won by the former in the affirmative. Mrs. Anne\r\nM. Jewett, who had served acceptably as recording secretary for ten\r\nyears, resigned. Miss Mary M. Angell was elected at the annual meeting\r\nand gave a like term of years of devoted service. Mrs. Dewing was made\r\nhonorary president. In 1911 a lecture on Woman's Ballot by Professor\r\nHenry S. Nash of Harvard University, well known as a lecturer, before\r\nthe Providence Biblical Institute, greatly strengthened the cause\r\namong conservative people. Mrs. Emmeline Pankhurst gave a lecture\r\nunder the auspices of the State association and the College League.\r\nThis year the first anti-suffrage society was organized by a group of\r\nwealthy and prominent women, among whom were Mrs. Charles Warren\r\nLippitt, Mrs. Rowland Hazard, Miss Louise Hoppin, Mrs. Herbert Maine\r\nand Mrs. Henry T. Fowler. Miss Yates and Mrs. Lippitt were invited to\r\nhold a debate before the Jewish Women's Council.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1912, the College League and the State association opened\r\nheadquarters in Butler Exchange at Providence and engaged Miss Louise\r\nHall as organizer. President M. Carey Thomas of Bryn Mawr College\r\nspoke under the auspices of the State Collegiate Alumnae on the Need\r\nof Woman's Ballot and made a strong impression on this conservative\r\nuniversity city. From May the College League assumed the office duties\r\nand the State association carried on the field work. This year a booth\r\nwas secured at the Food Fair of the Retail Grocers' Association,\r\nwhere thousands of new members were enrolled, tens of thousands of\r\nleaflets were distributed and much publicity work was done. The\r\n\"suffrage map\" was in evidence, showing the many States that had been\r\nwon, an irrefutable argument against the emanations of the\r\nanti-suffrage booth. At no other time and place could so many classes\r\nof persons be reached. The arduous work involved was carried on by\r\nMiss Alice F. Porter, Miss Nettie E. Bauer, Mrs. George E. Dunbar,\r\nMiss Enid Peirce, Miss Althea L. Hall, Miss Margaretha Dwight, Mrs.\r\nCaroline Dowell, Miss Ethel Parks and a score more of like unselfish\r\nworkers.[158] At the annual meeting in October Mrs. Homer, who had\r\nbeen the efficient corresponding secretary for six years, declined\r\nre-election and Mrs. Sara L. Fittz was elected to the office, which\r\nposition she retained until the end. She served also as chairman of\r\nthe Publicity Committee and was always in demand as a speaker. Miss\r\nHall went to assist in the Ohio campaign, accompanied by Mrs. Camilla\r\nVon Klenze, president of the College League. In April Dr. Shaw\r\naddressed a large audience at Infantry Hall. In the summer suffrage\r\nheadquarters were established on Franklin Street, Newport, mainly\r\nthrough the energy of Mrs. Belmont, a member of the Newport League,\r\nand meetings were held here every afternoon during this and other\r\nseasons.\r\n\r\nIn 1913 the work of the year opened with a lecture by Miss Mary\r\nJohnston, the novelist, on Woman in Politics and one by Mrs. Carrie\r\nChapman Catt on the White Slave Traffic. Mrs. Catt also addressed a\r\nmeeting in the interests of the Woman Suffrage Party, which had been\r\norganized under the leadership of Mrs. Sara M. Algeo. The State\r\nassociation and the College League being dues-paying organizations\r\nthere was an open field for the non-dues-paying Suffrage Party formed\r\nalong political lines. Nearly all the members of the older\r\nassociations joined it and at the same time continued to maintain\r\ntheir own lines of propaganda. Miss Yates, the State president, was\r\ninvited by the municipal government to deliver the Fourth of July\r\naddress at City Hall, Providence. Dr. Valeria H. Parker addressed the\r\nannual convention on Women as Civil Guardians.\r\n\r\nIn 1914 a series of lectures on the Modern Woman of Various Countries\r\nwas given by the State association which called out large audiences.\r\nThe three organizations united in a celebration of \"suffrage week\" in\r\nMay, closing with a meeting in the Casino at Roger Williams Park with\r\nRabbi Stephen S. Wise as the principal speaker. Miss Yates, after\r\nserving five years, was obliged on account of other demands on her\r\ntime to decline reelection and was made honorary president. No\r\npresident being elected at the annual meeting, Agnes M. (Mrs. Barton\r\nP.) Jenks was chosen later by the Executive Committee to fill the\r\nvacancy and afterwards was elected and held the office until May,\r\n1918. In December representatives of the three organizations met and\r\nformed a Cooperative Council to secure economy of effort and increased\r\nefficiency. The work of the College League had been of distinctive\r\nvalue in Providence, the seat of Brown University with its Woman's\r\nCollege. During the years of its independent existence it had been\r\nwell served by its presidents, Miss Garvin, Mrs. Von Klenze, Mrs.\r\nAlgeo and Miss Helen Emerson. It presented speakers of national\r\nreputation; published special leaflets, notably What Rhode Island\r\nWomen Ought to Know; conducted study clubs and gave generous\r\ncooperation in the undertakings of the other organizations.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1915 a special series of lectures was given for\r\nthe council on political and economic subjects by professors of the\r\nUniversity. The joint endeavors of the three organizations this winter\r\nproving successful they amalgamated under the name of the Rhode Island\r\nEqual Suffrage Association and the annual meeting was changed from\r\nfall to spring. Most of the officers of the State association were\r\nretained. Others were Miss Emerson and Mrs. Carl Barus,\r\nvice-presidents; Mrs. John A. Cross, treasurer; Mrs. Barton A. Ballou,\r\nMrs. Gerald A. Cooper and Mrs. Gilbert C. Carpenter, auditors; Mrs.\r\nDunbar and Mrs. Helen Dougherty, chairman and secretary of the Woman\r\nSuffrage Party. In accordance with the plan of the National\r\nAssociation, the State's members of Congress, U. S. Senators LeBaron\r\nB. Colt and Henry F. Lippitt; Representatives Walter R. Stiness,\r\nGeorge F. O'Shaughnessy and Ambrose Kennedy, were interviewed on the\r\nFederal Amendment with encouraging results. Weekly suffrage teas were\r\nestablished at headquarters during the winter, followed by addresses\r\non current topics. The association was especially indebted to Mrs.\r\nBallou, Mrs. Edward M. Harris and Miss Sarah J. Eddy for the\r\nhospitality of their homes that combined on many occasions social\r\npleasure with excellent opportunity to present the suffrage cause.\r\n\r\nOn February 17, 1916, a luncheon and conference at the Narragansett\r\nHotel were held in honor of Mrs. Catt, now national president. A mass\r\nmeeting was held in March in Sayles Hall, where Mrs. Glendower Evans\r\nof Boston and Professor Louis J. Johnston of Harvard spoke in the\r\ninterest of the Federal Amendment. In April a \"suffrage shop\" was\r\nopened in Providence in charge of Miss Mary B. Anthony, which proved\r\nan active center of propaganda. Rhode Island was represented in the\r\nsuffrage parades during the national political conventions in Chicago\r\nand St. Louis in 1916 by Miss Yates. On election night in November a\r\npublic reception was held at suffrage headquarters, where a private\r\nwire had been installed to give the returns and large numbers were\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nIn 1917 Miss Yates conducted a suffrage school weekly at headquarters\r\nduring February and March. The major activities of the year were given\r\nto legislative work. The granting of Presidential suffrage to women by\r\nthe Legislature was celebrated at the annual meeting, at which\r\nGovernor R. Livingston Beeckman, representatives of the political\r\nparties of the State and Mrs. Nettie Rogers Shuler, national\r\ncorresponding secretary, were the principal speakers. An invitation\r\nwas accepted from Thomas W. Bicknell, one of the staunchest\r\nsuffragists, to unite with the Citizens' Historical Association, of\r\nwhich he was president, in a joint celebration of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence by Rhode Island on May 4, 1776, and the passage of the\r\nPresidential suffrage bill in April, 1917, and Miss Yates was chosen\r\nas speaker for the State association. Miss Elizabeth M. Barr was\r\nelected treasurer in 1917 and served until 1920. Miss Barr's\r\npredecessors were Miss Mary K. Wood, Mrs. Jewett, Mrs. Ballou, Mrs.\r\nHelen N. B. Janes, Mrs. Porter, Mrs. Cross, and Mrs. George W. Parks.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1918, a civics course was conducted by Miss\r\nAnthony covering local and national government, Mayor Joseph H. Gainer\r\nof Providence and other city officers speaking in the course. Miss\r\nAnthony was elected State president at the annual meeting in June and\r\nbrought to the office experience in public work and wide social\r\ninfluence that were of special value in the closing years of the\r\nassociation. Mrs. Jenks was made honorary president. On December 11\r\nthe 50th anniversary of the association was celebrated. An interesting\r\nhistorical review of the first meeting was given by Arnold Buffum\r\nChace, who had acted as secretary on that occasion and whose mother,\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Buffum Chace, was president of the association for\r\nthirty years. The Rev. Mrs. Spencer, also a charter member, recounted\r\nthe early struggles of the pioneers. Miss Yates and Mrs. Jenks gave\r\ninteresting accounts of the early and later work. Mrs. Catt and Miss\r\nBlackwell were guests of honor and brought inspiring messages. This\r\nyear both the Democratic and Republican parties put suffrage planks in\r\ntheir State platforms and sent resolutions to Congress urging the\r\nRhode Island Senators to support the Federal Amendment.\r\n\r\nThe suffragists responded to every demand of the Government for war\r\nservice. Mrs. Walter A. Peck, honorary vice-president, was State\r\nchairman of the Woman's Committee of the Liberty Loan. Miss Emerson,\r\nfirst vice-president, served in France with the Bryn Mawr unit. Miss\r\nBauer, second vice-president, was a member of the executive board of\r\nthe Red Cross. Miss Fittz, corresponding secretary, and Miss Yates,\r\nhonorary president, received government certificates as speakers with\r\nthe \"four-minute men.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1919 Miss Frances E. Lucas, chairman of the Civics Committee, gave\r\na course of lectures on social and political problems, which were\r\nlargely attended. Miss Avis Hawkins, chairman on schools, perfected an\r\norganization throughout the State to advance the interests of both\r\npupils and teachers. On May 27 the Woman's College and the State\r\nAssociation commemorated the centenary of the birth of Julia Ward\r\nHowe, in Pembroke Hall of the college. At the annual meeting on June 4\r\nMiss Anthony was re-elected president. Mrs. Raymond Brown, national\r\nvice-president, gave an interesting address. The occasion was made\r\nmemorable by the passing of the resolution for the Federal Amendment\r\nby the U. S. Senate while the convention was in session. The entire\r\nRhode Island delegation in both Houses of Congress voted in favor, the\r\nonly eastern State except Maine to have this record. In October Miss\r\nAnthony called a meeting of the presidents of all the women's\r\norganizations of the State in the interests of social betterment,\r\nwhich resulted in the foundation of the Civics Cooperative Council,\r\nand Mrs. Nancy M. Schoonmaker was engaged to give a course of lectures\r\non Citizenship.[159]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOMAN SUFFRAGE PARTY.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1915 Mrs. Sara M. Algeo re-organized the Woman Suffrage\r\nParty as an independent body and began a vigorous campaign for civic\r\nbetterment and political education. Miss Mary E. McDowell of Chicago\r\nand Miss Margaret Foley of Boston addressed large audiences. Its\r\npolicy was to invite the fullest cooperation of colored women and a\r\nmeeting was held at which Mrs. Robert M. LaFollette spoke to a large\r\naudience of both colored and white women on their common need of full\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\nIn 1916 the endorsement of the State conference of Congregational\r\nChurches was secured. A civic forum was organized in Providence,\r\nholding Sunday afternoon meetings in a theater. Among the eminent\r\nspeakers were Lord and Lady Aberdeen, Thomas Mott Osborne, Mrs. Kate\r\nWaller Barrett, Mary Antin and Mrs. Nellie McClung of Canada. The same\r\nline of work was followed elsewhere in the State. A suffrage class was\r\nestablished at the Young Men's Christian Association. Miss Laura Clay\r\nof Kentucky gave ten days of helpful service.\r\n\r\nIn 1917 Mrs. LeBaron B. Colt of Bristol was appointed committee\r\nchairman of the Women's Oversea Hospitals conducted by the National\r\nSuffrage Association and with the assistance of Mrs. Algeo and the\r\nparty $3,000 were raised. After the passage of the Presidential\r\nsuffrage bill in 1917 the party specialized in training for\r\ncitizenship and conducted a campaign in naturalization in conjunction\r\nwith the Americanization Committee of the National Association. In the\r\nfall under the direction of Mrs. Frederick H. Bagley of Boston, its\r\nchairman, efforts were made to secure from the Legislature an\r\nAmericanization bill providing compulsory education for immigrants and\r\nalso for a director of Americanization on the Board of Education,\r\nwhich was passed in 1919. Mrs. Agnes M. Bacon was appointed by the\r\nGovernor.\r\n\r\nIn 1919 Mrs. Algeo compiled and published Suggestions to the Women\r\nVoters of Rhode Island, of which thousands of copies were circulated.\r\nJuly 1, being the first day of registration for the elections of the\r\nfollowing year, she organized a state-wide campaign for the\r\nregistration of women for using the presidential vote. It was\r\ncelebrated in Providence by an imposing ceremony on the steps of the\r\nCity Hall at noon, and in the evening by a banquet, at which Mrs.\r\nCharles H. Brooks of Kansas, national chairman of the League of Women\r\nVoters, and Mrs. Charles Tiffany of New York were the principal\r\nspeakers. This year Miss Leila P. Andrews was elected president of the\r\nWoman Suffrage Party and Mrs. Algeo president of the Providence League\r\nof Women Voters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. After the defeat of a woman suffrage amendment to\r\nthe State constitution in 1887 and the refusal of the Legislatures\r\nafterwards to submit it again the association decided to follow the\r\nadvice of Henry B. Blackwell and try to obtain a vote for presidential\r\nelectors, which could be granted by a law. The proposition, first made\r\nin 1892, met with practically no support among the legislators and\r\nfinally further attempts to secure it were discontinued for years. At\r\nthe annual meeting of 1902 an address by Mr. Blackwell resulted in a\r\nresumption of efforts to secure this law and in 1903 a petition to the\r\nLegislature, signed by influential men and women, accompanied a bill\r\nintroduced in the Senate. A hearing was given but it was not reported\r\nfrom committee.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 the bill was presented in the House and Senate and reported\r\nfavorably but defeated in both branches.\r\n\r\nIn 1905 there was increased activity to secure favorable action on the\r\nbill. A little paper called _The Woman Citizen_ was issued as a\r\ncampaign document and a copy of it placed on the desk of every\r\nlegislator.[160] The _Remonstrance_, a small paper published by the\r\nMassachusetts Anti-Suffrage Association followed, protesting against\r\nit. The merits of the bill were presented at a well attended hearing\r\nbut no action was taken on it.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 a Senate hearing was given on the bill, addressed by Mr.\r\nBlackwell. It was reported without recommendation and ably debated.\r\nSenator Walter R. Stiness made a strong speech in its support and it\r\npassed by 29 ayes, 7 noes. In the House the bill was referred to the\r\nCommittee on Special Legislation. Long petitions from prominent voters\r\nwere presented asking that it be reported but General Charles R.\r\nBrayton, the Republican \"boss\" who for years controlled the\r\nLegislature, seeing the strong sentiment in its favor would not permit\r\nit to come to a vote. He admitted that he feared it would help the\r\nDemocratic party.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 the battle for the bill was renewed and among the petitioners\r\nwas Governor James H. Higgins. At two largely attended hearings nearly\r\nevery person gave a rising vote in favor. Mrs. Charles Warren Lippitt\r\nand Mrs. Edward Johnson protested against women's being allowed to\r\nvote for President and Rowland Hazard supported them. The bill was\r\ndefeated, though not by them but by political opposition.\r\n\r\nIn 1909 Mr. Blackwell appeared for the last time as the advocate of\r\nthe measure. Like a seer he pleaded for it, the significance and\r\npotency of which he grasped far in advance of his contemporaries. Miss\r\nYates was appointed his successor as the National Association's\r\nchairman of Presidential suffrage, which position he had filled for\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\nIn 1911 the Presidential suffrage bill was introduced in the Senate\r\nand referred to the Committee on Special Legislation, that limbo of\r\nlost causes. The suffragists rallied for a hearing and succeeded in\r\ngetting it reported without recommendation. When taken from the\r\ncalendar the Senators seemed to realize for the first time that they\r\nwere dealing with a live issue. One of them demanded to know why that\r\nbill was permitted to waste their valuable time and threw it on the\r\nfloor and stamped on it, saying: \"I will kill woman suffrage.\" It was\r\nthen buried by a vote of 29 noes and 3 ayes. The suffragists passed\r\nout from the obsequies with full faith in the resurrection.\r\n\r\nIn 1913 a commission was appointed to revise the State constitution\r\nand an appeal to it was made for a woman suffrage clause. A hearing\r\nwas given; influential men supported the association; the women\r\n\"antis\" made a touching plea to be spared from the burden of the\r\nballot, but the constitution was not revised. This year the\r\nLegislature of Illinois passed a bill for Presidential suffrage, which\r\nattracted wide attention. The Rhode Island association continued to\r\npresent one every year. Sometimes zealous friends would introduce a\r\nresolution for a constitutional amendment but it was not endorsed by\r\nthe State association as it would require a three-fifths majority of\r\nthe voters.\r\n\r\nIn 1915 Governor R. Livingston Beeckman recommended Presidential\r\nsuffrage for women in his message and the use of the hall of the House\r\nof Representatives in the new State House was for the first time\r\ngranted for a hearing. Mrs. Agnes M. Jenks, State president, secured\r\nSenator John D. Works of California and Representative Frank W.\r\nMondell of Wyoming to speak on the practical effects of woman suffrage\r\nin their States. Mrs. A. J. George came from Brookline, Mass., to\r\nvoice the fears of the \"antis.\" Notwithstanding the hearing surpassed\r\nin attendance and interest any that session the bill was indefinitely\r\npostponed by a House vote of 61 ayes and 31 noes. An active lobby was\r\nmaintained and every available influence brought to bear to get the\r\nbill on the Senate calendar but it was killed in committee.\r\n\r\nBetween the close of this Legislature and the opening of the one of\r\n1917 unforeseen events caused a marked change in the attitude of Rhode\r\nIsland politicians. Its delegates to the Democratic and Republican\r\nnational conventions in 1916 had recognized the party expediency which\r\ncompelled a plank in the national platforms in favor of woman\r\nsuffrage and voted for it. At the Republican State convention in\r\nSeptember U. S. Senator LeBaron B. Colt, who had been non-committal on\r\nthe question, came out with a decisive pronouncement in its favor. The\r\nRepublicans saw the handwriting on the wall. They recognized that the\r\nvotes of western women had re-elected President Wilson. For the first\r\ntime since the Republican party was organized, a Democratic U. S.\r\nSenator was elected. Both parties were on the alert for any issue that\r\nmight bring re-inforcements.\r\n\r\nOnce more Presidential suffrage was the objective and Governor\r\nBeeckman repeated his endorsement. The bill was introduced in the\r\nSenate Feb. 8, 1917. The association's Legislative Committee worked\r\nwithout ceasing. The suffragists throughout the State were well\r\norganized and loyally backed the committee. Petitions, letters and\r\ntelegrams showered the legislators. The endorsement of the Republican\r\nState Committee was secured. Meanwhile the Legislatures in half a\r\ndozen States granted Presidential suffrage. The time had come for\r\nRhode Island. On April 11 the bill passed the Senate by 32 ayes, 3\r\nnoes. There was an organized attempt to defeat it in the House by one\r\nfor a referendum to the voters but by the efforts of Richard W.\r\nJennings and Daniel E. Geary, Republican and Democratic floor leaders,\r\nit was defeated. On April 17, after four hours' debate in the presence\r\nof hundreds of women, the bill passed by 71 ayes, 20 noes. This was\r\nthe fifteenth time it had been before the Legislature. On April 18 it\r\nwas signed by the Governor.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. As soon as the Federal Amendment was submitted by\r\nCongress June 4, 1919, the suffrage organizations began to ask for a\r\nspecial session of the Legislature for ratification but it was deemed\r\nbest by Governor Beeckman for various reasons to wait until the\r\nregular session in January, 1920. Several days before it met the\r\nchairman of the Republican State Committee, Joseph P. Burlingame, made\r\nthe announcement that by a suspension of the rules and contrary to\r\nevery precedent ratification would be accomplished on the first day.\r\nThe longed-for day, January 6, dawned clear and cold. Women thronged\r\nthe Capitol and filled the galleries of the House, except the section\r\nwhich was occupied by the Governor's party, who had come to witness\r\nthe final scene in a fifty years' drama. After summoning the Senate\r\nto meet with the House in Grand Committee, the Governor read his\r\nannual message in which he recommended immediate ratification of the\r\namendment, \"as an act of justice long delayed.\" The resolution was at\r\nonce presented and the floor leaders of both parties, William R.\r\nFortin of Pawtucket, Republican, and William S. Flynn of Providence,\r\nDemocrat, spoke in favor. It was passed on roll call by 89 ayes, 3\r\nnoes--Speaker Arthur P. Sumner of Providence, William H. Thayer of\r\nBristol and Albert R. Zurlinden of Lincoln. A rush was made by the\r\naudience across the corridors to the Senate Chamber, where action was\r\neven more rapid. Lieutenant Governor Emery J. San Souci, a friend of\r\nwoman suffrage, was in the chair and within a few moments, with no\r\nspeeches, the resolution was passed by viva voce vote with but one\r\ndissenting voice, that of John H. McCabe of Burrillville. The\r\nfollowing day it was signed by Governor Beeckman, not that this was\r\nnecessary but he wished to give it his approval.\r\n\r\nThe great event was celebrated in the evening by a brilliant banquet\r\ngiven by the Providence League of Women Voters at which the work of\r\nthe pioneers was especially featured. A handsome dinner given by the\r\nWoman Suffrage Party took place at which the Governor and other public\r\nofficials spoke on the great victory. Miss Jeannette Rankin, the first\r\nwoman member of Congress, was a speaker.[161]\r\n\r\nOn May 17, 1920, the Rhode Island Equal Suffrage Association concluded\r\nits work and merged into the State League of Women Voters, Miss Mary\r\nB. Anthony, chairman. Then a procession of women marched through the\r\nstreets of Providence carrying the records of the organization for\r\nfifty years, which were deposited in the archives of the State House\r\nwith impressive ceremony.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the nerve centers of suffrage activity in Rhode Island the\r\nNewport County Woman Suffrage League had a definite place from its\r\nfounding in 1908, by Miss Cora Mitchell, its first president. The\r\nLeague's work was at first largely carried on by an active group of\r\nphilanthropic women of Bristol Ferry, Miss Mitchell's friends and\r\nneighbors, among whom were Miss Sarah J. Eddy, Mrs. John Eldredge and\r\nMrs. Barton Ballou. Gradually the suffrage agitation spread over the\r\nentire island, which includes the three townships of Portsmouth,\r\nMiddletown and Newport. In Middletown the league's work was ably\r\ncarried on by Mrs. Eugene Sturtevant and her daughters. All rendered\r\npriceless service to what was then an unpopular and unfashionable\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nMrs. Julia Ward Howe was present at the first meeting and as long as\r\nshe lived took great interest in its work. This interest was inherited\r\nby her daughters, Mrs. Maud Howe Elliott and Mrs. Florence Howe Hall.\r\nThe summer meetings were sometimes held at Oak Glen, Portsmouth, Mrs.\r\nHowe's country home, and here on soft June afternoons the veteran\r\nsuffrage workers and the young neophytes destined to carry on their\r\nwork rejoiced in coming together. On one occasion a young stranger was\r\nnoticed in the audience who followed the proceedings with breathless\r\ninterest. Soon afterwards Mrs. Norman deR. Whitehouse of New York\r\nbegan her fine service for suffrage, which was continued until the\r\nvictory was won in that State.\r\n\r\nMany of the most distinguished speakers ever heard in Newport came\r\nunder the auspices of this league. Among the active workers were Mrs.\r\nWalter Wright, secretary and treasurer; Miss Elizabeth Peckham, Mrs.\r\nOscar Miller, Mrs. Bertram Storrs and many others, and among the\r\nfaithful members Admiral and Mrs. Sims rendered \"aid and comfort\"\r\nbeyond belief in those days when it took some courage in fashionable\r\nNewport to \"come out\" for woman suffrage!\r\n\r\n[The long and interesting account of this league must be omitted\r\nbecause space can be given only to national and State organizations.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[157] The History is indebted for this chapter to Miss Elizabeth Upham\r\nYates, president of the State Woman Suffrage Association 1909-1914,\r\nand honorary president until its work was finished in 1920.\r\n\r\n[158] The presidents of the State Woman's Christian Temperance Union,\r\nMrs. Susan Hammond Barney, Mrs. Emeline Burlingame Cheney, Mrs. Mary\r\nA. Babcock, Mrs. Deborah Knox Livingston, Mrs. Jennie L. W. Rooke and\r\nMrs. Ethelyn Roberts have all been active workers for woman suffrage.\r\n\r\n[159] In addition to those already mentioned, the following have been\r\nofficers or members of the State Executive Committees: Mrs. Ellen M.\r\nCalder, Mrs. Elizabeth Ormsbee, Mrs. Fanny Purdy Palmer, Mrs. Ora A.\r\nAngell, Mrs. Sarah M. Aldrich, Mrs. Betsy A. Stearns, Miss Mary K.\r\nConington, Mrs. Annie B. Jackson, Mrs. Catherine G. Wilbur, Mrs. Clara\r\nF. Delaney, Mrs. Myra Phinney, Miss S. Arvilla Jewett, Mrs. Amy E.\r\nHarris, Miss Katherine H. Austin, Mrs. Josephine Fry, Miss Eleanor B.\r\nGreen, Mrs. Margaret C. Edgren, Mrs. Victor Frazee, Mrs. Anna B.\r\nKroener, Miss Abby P. Gardiner, Mrs. William H. Adams, Mrs. Nathaniel\r\nGreene, Mrs. Job Manchester, Mrs. William A. H. Comstock, Miss Mabel\r\nOrgelman, Mrs. Edwin C. Smith, Mrs. Ava C. Minsher, Mrs. Fred S.\r\nFenner, Mrs. Clarence Fuller, Mrs. Frank A. Jackson, Miss Sarah E.\r\nDoyle, Mrs. Alfred M. Coats, Miss Ellen G. Hunt and Mrs. Charles\r\nRemington.\r\n\r\nTo these should be added a list of men to whom the workers are deeply\r\nindebted.\r\n\r\n[160] The _Woman Citizen_ was edited and published for ten years by\r\nMrs. Jeannette French, and was a valuable contribution to the movement\r\nfor woman suffrage.\r\n\r\n[161] At the next Democratic State convention Miss Elizabeth Upham\r\nYates received the nomination for Lieutenant Governor amid great\r\nenthusiasm. She was termed \"a student of sociology, missionary leader,\r\nprophet and dreamer, whose dreams have come true.\"--Ed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nSOUTH CAROLINA.[162]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a number of years there had been a suffrage association in South\r\nCarolina with Mrs. Virginia Durant Young, editor of the Fairfax\r\n_Enterprise_, president. Evidence of advance in public sentiment was\r\nshown when in April, 1900, by invitation, Mrs. Young addressed 5,000\r\npeople at Rivers Bridges Memorial Association; in June when Mrs.\r\nMalvina A. Waring made the commencement address at Limestone College\r\nand again when Mrs. Young responded to a toast at the banquet of the\r\nState Press Association. That same year there was lively effort to\r\ndecide which one of twenty women candidates should be elected State\r\nlibrarian. Miss Lucy Barron was elected and a large number of women\r\nengrossing clerks were appointed to share her work.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 during the Exposition a woman suffrage convention was held in\r\nCharleston through the courtesy of the chairman of Promotion and\r\nPublicity, Major J. C. Hemphill. Although opposed to woman suffrage he\r\ninduced the officials in charge to grant the use of the German\r\nArtillery Hall for two nights and one meeting was held in the\r\nexposition grounds, where Henry B. and Miss Alice Stone Blackwell,\r\nMrs. Mamie Folsom Wynn, Miss Koch, Miss Helen Morris Lewis, Miss\r\nClaudia G. Tharin, Mrs. T. M. Prentiss and Mrs. Young made addresses.\r\nA reception was given in the Woman's Building. In May, 1903, Mrs.\r\nYoung made a suffrage speech at the meeting of the State Press\r\nAssociation at Georgetown. With her death in 1906 the organization\r\nlapsed but there was a small group of suffragists in Columbia with Dr.\r\nJane Bruce Guignard president.\r\n\r\nIt was not until May 15, 1914, when Miss Lavinia Engle, one of the\r\norganizers sent by the National American Woman Suffrage Association,\r\ncalled together a representative group of clubwomen, that the State\r\nEqual Suffrage League was organized in the Kennedy Library at\r\nSpartanburg. Mrs. M. T. Coleman of Abbeville, retiring president of\r\nthe State Federation of Women's Clubs, was elected president; Mrs.\r\nJohn Gary Evans, Spartanburg, first and Mrs. J. L. Coker, Hartsville,\r\nsecond, vice-president; Mrs. Henry Martin, Columbia, secretary; Mrs.\r\nF. T. Kicklin, Chester, treasurer. Dr. Rosa H. Gannt, Spartanburg, was\r\nappointed legislative chairman. Three organized leagues--Columbia,\r\nCharleston and Spartanburg--with a membership of about 450, joined at\r\nthis time. In twenty months the number of local leagues increased to\r\neight and the membership to 1,514.\r\n\r\nThree speakers were brought to the State during the winter of 1915,\r\nMrs. Lila Meade Valentine, president of the Virginia League; Mrs.\r\nDesha Breckinridge, president of the Kentucky Association, and Miss\r\nKate M. Gordon of Louisiana. The league supplied literature for school\r\nand club debates and distributed it at many county fairs. On October\r\n17 a State convention was held in Columbia. Mrs. Coleman and Dr. Gannt\r\nresigned; Mrs. Harriet P. Lynch, Cheraw, was elected president and\r\nMrs. W. C. Cathcart of Columbia was appointed legislative chairman.\r\nThis year for the first time suffrage was represented in a parade of\r\nwomen, which took place during the State Fair with a suffrage float in\r\nthe evening display.\r\n\r\nIn 1916 the annual convention met in Charlestown. During the year Mrs.\r\nLynch had stressed organization and chairmen had been appointed in\r\nsixteen counties to work along political lines, the unit of\r\norganization being the wards in cities and townships in counties. A\r\nplank in the Democratic platform to refer a woman suffrage amendment\r\nto the voters was secured at the State convention in the spring and\r\nState and national candidates were canvassed as to their views on\r\nwoman suffrage.\r\n\r\nWhen the convention of 1917 was held in Columbia in October there were\r\ntwenty-five leagues in the State with a membership of about 3,000. The\r\nFederal Suffrage Amendment, the Prohibition Amendment, Food\r\nAdministration as outlined by Mr. Hoover and a Minimum Wage for Women\r\nwere endorsed. Protests were made against any attempt to lower\r\neducational standards or to weaken the laws safeguarding women and\r\nchildren. The Legislative Committee reported that before the\r\nLegislature convened its members had been completely canvassed as to\r\ntheir views on woman suffrage; these were classified and only a few\r\nwere tagged impossible. A \"suffrage school\" was held in Columbia in\r\nDecember under the auspices of the National Association with one\r\nhundred pupils. During the year woman suffrage had been endorsed by\r\nthe State Federation of Labor, Federation of Women's Clubs and Woman's\r\nChristian Temperance Union.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1918, Mrs. Cathcart was appointed by U. S. Senator Tillman as\r\nassociate committeewoman on the Democratic National Committee. When\r\nthe State Democratic convention was held in Columbia that month the\r\ncommitteewoman and the committee decided that this was the opportunity\r\nfor the Democratic party to substantiate its pledge. Senator Neils\r\nChristensen was asked to introduce a resolution requesting the party\r\nto permit women to vote in the Democratic Primaries in August,\r\nprovided the 36th State had ratified the Federal Amendment. The\r\nresolution was debated in committee and rejected by a vote of 18 to\r\n14. The convention adopted the unfavorable report by a vote of 249 to\r\n58. The women were not only rejected but through the spokesman for the\r\nopposing faction, U. S. Senator Christie Benet of Columbia, they were\r\ndubbed as paid propagandists. This the women denied through the press\r\nand called on him to prove his accusation, which was never done. The\r\nState suffrage convention was held in October and Mrs. Lynch and Mrs.\r\nCathcart were re-elected. At this convention the league declared\r\nitself in favor of the Federal Suffrage Amendment as a war measure.\r\n\r\nThe State convention of 1919 was held in Columbia in January, Mrs.\r\nJulian B. Salley of Aiken presiding. Resolutions on the death of Dr.\r\nAnna Howard Shaw, also resolutions endorsing the Treaty of Peace and\r\nthe League of Nations were read by Mrs. Cathcart and adopted. Mrs.\r\nLynch, whose resignation was accepted, was made honorary president,\r\nand at the meeting of the executive committee in Columbia in July Mrs.\r\nSalley was elected president. During the year work was immensely\r\nstrengthened by the contribution of the National Association of 10,000\r\npieces of literature and of Miss Lola Trax, who in five months\r\norganized forty counties for the petition work for ratification. The\r\nNational's expenditures were over $1,700.\r\n\r\nThe State convention of 1920 met in Columbia in January at the\r\nJefferson Hotel and was welcomed by Governor Robert A. Cooper, who\r\nsaid he was convinced that women would soon vote. U. S. Senator\r\nPollock of Cheraw made a rousing speech in favor of the Federal\r\nAmendment. Mrs. Salley reviewed the year's work, telling of the\r\ndistribution of 10,000 copies of Senator Pollock's speech in Congress;\r\nof the new course of citizenship in the State University and of the\r\ngrowth of the organization. The legislative report of the past five\r\nyears was read by the chairman, Mrs. Cathcart. Mrs. Munsell, chairman\r\nof the American Citizenship Committee, reported a ten-day course of\r\ncitizenship at Winthrop Summer School; a summer class at the\r\nUniversity of South Carolina; one at Coker College, Hartsville,\r\nconducted by Mrs. J. L. Coker, and a course at Converse College,\r\nSpartanburg. Mrs. Cathcart, chairman of the Resolutions Committee,\r\nread the following: \"The State Equal Suffrage League tenders\r\nappreciation and thanks to the members of the General Assembly of\r\nSouth Carolina, who have fostered the cause ... among them Joseph E.\r\nMcCullough, Greenville; A. E. Horton, Spartanburg; James A. Hoyt,\r\nSpeaker of the House; Senators J. L. Sherard, Anderson; Neils\r\nChristensen, Beaufort; Allan Johnston, Newberry; Legrande Walker,\r\nGeorgetown; T. C. Duncan, Union, and Representative Shelor, Oconee. We\r\ncommend William P. Pollock who spoke and voted in the U. S. Senate for\r\nthe Federal Suffrage Amendment, for his loyalty to his convictions and\r\nhis belief in true democracy.\" At the afternoon session Miss Marjorie\r\nShuler, who had been sent by the National Association for press and\r\npublicity work for one month, was one of the principal speakers.\r\nDelegates were elected for the meeting to be called to merge the Equal\r\nSuffrage League into the League of Women Voters. This meeting was held\r\nJune 20 at Craven Hall, Columbia, the league was formed and Mrs.\r\nMunsell was elected chairman.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. In 1902 Mrs. Virginia D. Young, then president of\r\nthe suffrage association, brought personal influence to bear on the\r\nGovernor, Senators and Representatives for a hearing on woman\r\nsuffrage. On January 28 Senator Aldrich and Representative Izler\r\nintroduced simultaneously two bills, one asking for Presidential\r\nsuffrage for taxpaying women; the other for suffrage in Municipal\r\nelections. A hearing was held before a joint session January 31, with\r\nthe galleries crowded, where, in Mrs. Young's own words, \"I was\r\nreceived with the usual chivalric attention and asked if I would\r\nascend to the Speaker's chair. 'By no means. I wish to speak from the\r\nfloor,' I answered. This privilege was accorded me and for the first\r\ntime a woman spoke in the House of Representatives.\"\r\n\r\n1914. From 1902 there is no record of action on the part of the\r\nGeneral Assembly to grant suffrage to women until Jan. 23, 1914, when\r\na bill was introduced in the House by Mr. McMillan and referred to the\r\nJudiciary Committee, by which it was unfavorably reported the next day\r\nand rejected without a record vote, after little if any discussion. It\r\nhad been introduced in the Senate by Mr. Carlisle on the 15th and\r\nreferred to the Judiciary Committee, which reported it without\r\nrecommendation February 25, and the next day it was laid on the table\r\nwithout discussion or a record vote.\r\n\r\n1915. Early in the session a resolution was introduced asking for the\r\nsubmission of a woman suffrage amendment to the State constitution. In\r\nconnection an invitation was extended by Speaker James A. Hoyt of\r\nColumbia to Mrs. Valentine, president of the Virginia Suffrage League,\r\nto address the House and she spoke most convincingly. It was said that\r\nif a vote had been taken that night the resolution would have been\r\nadopted. It was referred to the Judiciary Committee, which granted a\r\nhearing. The speakers were the Rev. Kirkman G. Finlay, Professor Lewis\r\nParke Chamberlayne, Mrs. Coleman, Mrs. Lynch, Miss Eudora Ramsey, Dr.\r\nGannt and Mrs. Valentine. The resolution was reported out of the\r\ncommittee unfavorably, with a minority report, and it was thought best\r\nnot to push for a vote.\r\n\r\n1916. The resolution for an amendment was introduced in the House by\r\nJudge McCullough of Greenville and received a vote of 51 ayes; 61\r\nnoes.\r\n\r\n1917. The amendment resolution was introduced by Senator J. L. Sherard\r\nand Representative A. E. Horton. After an exciting debate lasting for\r\nthree days the Senate bill came to a vote, receiving 25 ayes; 19 noes.\r\nIn the House the bill was reported and placed early on the calendar\r\nfor the next year.\r\n\r\n1918. Mr. Horton, House leader, was requested by the league to\r\nwithdraw the resolution and state that as President Wilson had\r\ndeclared himself in favor of the Federal Suffrage Amendment and had\r\nrequested members of Congress to vote for its submission the league\r\nwould concentrate on this amendment. After the vote in favor by the U.\r\nS. House of Representatives letters and telegrams were sent by leagues\r\nand individuals all over the State requesting the Senators to vote for\r\nit. Both voted against it but with the election of William P. Pollock\r\nthe suffragists were encouraged. The amendment was submitted to the\r\nLegislatures June 4, 1919.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. On January 14, 1920, Senator Neils Christensen\r\nintroduced a joint resolution to ratify the proposed Federal Suffrage\r\nAmendment, which was referred to the Judiciary Committee. On the 23rd\r\nit was reported unfavorably; on motion of Senator Christensen the\r\nreport was laid on the table; on the 28th the resolution went to a\r\nvote and received 32 noes, four ayes--Christensen, Duncan, Shelor and\r\nWalker. In the House on January 21 Representatives Bradford and Hart\r\nintroduced a concurrent resolution to reject the proposed amendment;\r\non the 22nd a motion to refer it to the Judiciary Committee was\r\ndefeated by a vote of 85 to 26. The debate on the resolution to reject\r\nextended into the afternoon and the vote resulted in 93 ayes, 20 noes.\r\nEven members who were opposed to ratification made strong speeches for\r\njustice and denounced this unprecedented action of voting for a\r\nmeasure before it had been referred to a committee or placed on the\r\ncalendar.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[162] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. W. C. Cathcart,\r\nmember of the State Board of Public Welfare and chairman of the\r\nLegislative Committee of the State Equal Suffrage League for six\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nSOUTH DAKOTA.[163]\r\n\r\n\r\nHere beginneth the last chapter of the history of woman suffrage in\r\nSouth Dakota. At the time this is written (1920) women have the same\r\nrights, privileges and duties politically as men except that they do\r\nnot serve on juries but the law will undoubtedly be amended to permit\r\nthem to do so if there is any demand for it. For many years the\r\nsuffrage work was conducted by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union,\r\nits officers acting for the suffrage societies and its legislative\r\ncommittees doing the lobbying. The activities of the two organizations\r\nare so interwoven until 1909 that the history of the W. C. T. U. is\r\npractically the history of woman suffrage. The suffrage association\r\nwas inactive after the last defeat in 1898 until 1901. In that year a\r\nState Political Equality Association was organized with Mrs. Alice M.\r\nA. Pickler of Faulkton president and Mrs. Philena Everett Johnson of\r\nHighmore vice-president. She was the mother of Royal C. Johnson, now\r\nin Congress.\r\n\r\nA State amendment for full suffrage was not again submitted until 1909\r\nand in the interim there was a lull in active work although local\r\nclubs were formed as the nucleus of a larger organization. The\r\nsuffrage lobby, usually the same as the W. C. T. U. lobby, appeared at\r\neach session of the Legislature. When a suffrage resolution was\r\nintroduced it either died in committee or was reported out unfavorably\r\nand failed to pass. Always when the question was brought before either\r\nHouse there was a spirited debate and the suffragists then continued\r\ntheir campaign through literature and other means.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1902, Mrs. Pickler called a conference at Watertown which\r\ndecided to take advantage of the initiative and referendum, that the\r\nState had adopted in 1897. Not realizing that it did not apply to\r\nconstitutional amendments, the suffragists in 1903 at great expense\r\nand effort secured the signatures of the requisite number of voters to\r\na petition asking that a constitutional amendment be submitted to the\r\nvoters. Secretary of State O. C. Berg was criticized for refusing to\r\nreceive it for transmission to the Legislature but he could not\r\nlegally do so, as the initiative applied only to Laws. He was not\r\nopposed to woman suffrage and in later years his wife worked for it\r\nand his son conducted a newspaper which gave it able support.\r\n\r\nStill under the leadership of Mrs. Pickler, the years 1904 and 1905\r\npassed with the usual routine work and in 1906 another petition was\r\nbegun which had nothing to do with the initiative and referendum but\r\nwas merely a petition of women as citizens to the Legislature asking\r\nthat the question be submitted to a vote at the next general election.\r\nThis work was carried on all summer by a house to house canvass\r\nthroughout the State and later at the State Fair, with the result that\r\nwhen it convened the women were able to stage a spectacular event by\r\nhaving pages carry up the aisle of the Lower House a list of names\r\nthirty-six yards in length. The resolution was introduced and passed\r\nthe Senate but failed in the House by ten votes.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time Mrs. Anna R. Simmons of Faulkton was president of\r\nthe State W. C. T. U. and Mrs. Pickler and she did excellent team\r\nwork, enlisting the aid of many other splendid women. A complete list\r\nof them it is unfortunately impossible to secure but many mentioned in\r\nVolume IV of the History of Woman Suffrage continued their services.\r\nThe years 1907-8 were spent in propaganda work and raising funds and\r\nwhen the Legislature convened in January, 1909, the suffrage and W. C.\r\nT. U. lobby was on hand to ask once more for the submission of the\r\nquestion to the voters. Two resolutions for partial suffrage were\r\nintroduced in the Senate in addition to the one for the amendment. One\r\nwould confer the vote on property-owning women only and the other\r\nwould permit women to vote on the liquor question, the State being\r\nunder local option. Whether they were presented by friends or were a\r\n\"half loaf\" offered by enemies is not known at this late date. They\r\nwere probably the former, because a vote on the liquor question by\r\nwomen was the last thing the principal opponents wanted and such an\r\namendment if adopted would have speedily put South Dakota in the \"dry\"\r\ncolumn for all time. The resolution to send to the voters an amendment\r\nfor full suffrage passed both Houses and was signed by Governor Robert\r\nS. Vessey. His favorable attitude was a great help to the women, as it\r\nhad been in former years when he was in the State Senate.\r\n\r\nFrom 1909 the W. C. T. U. continued its suffrage work under its\r\nfranchise department and the State Suffrage Association was a separate\r\norganization. In June, 1909, a suffrage convention was held at\r\nAberdeen and Mrs. Lydia B. Johnson of Fort Pierre was elected\r\npresident of the State Political Equality League, a new constitution\r\nadopted, officers chosen and an invitation extended to all women's\r\norganizations to send delegates to a convention at Sioux Falls in the\r\nautumn, when plans for the coming campaign would be perfected. This\r\nconvention met November 6 and from that time until the election in\r\nNovember, 1910, an active campaign was conducted. The amendment was\r\ndefeated, receiving 35,290 ayes, 57,709 noes, but the workers felt\r\nthat gains had been made and were more determined than ever not to\r\ncease their efforts.\r\n\r\nAfter the election of 1910 Mrs. Johnson called a State convention at\r\nHuron and Mrs. John L. Pyle of that city was elected president and\r\ncontinued to serve until the Federal Suffrage Amendment was adopted in\r\n1920. The question was not again brought to the attention of the\r\nLegislature until 1913. During the summer of 1911 Mrs. Pyle called a\r\nconference at Huron. It seemed advisable to change the method of\r\nprocedure and the name of the organization, which became the Universal\r\nFranchise League. An incident of this conference--amusing now but very\r\nserious then--was the earnest discussion of the newly introduced\r\nslogan, \"Votes for Women,\" brought over from England. Several precious\r\nhours were spent considering whether this was dignified and whether\r\nwomen would not be considered \"unladylike\" if they adopted it. There\r\nwas much protest also over being called \"suffragettes\" when they were\r\nreally \"suffragists,\" the former being the English for \"militants.\" At\r\nthis meeting the State was divided into four districts for campaign\r\npurposes. Mrs. May Billinghurst of Pierre was chairman for the\r\nnortheast; Miss Susie Bird of Belle Fourche for the northwest; Mrs.\r\nEdith M. Fitch of Hurley for the southeast and the Rev. Katherine\r\nPowell of Custer for the southwest, to organize branch leagues in\r\ntheir districts.\r\n\r\nTheir stories of trying to organize, especially in the western, thinly\r\npopulated sections of the State would make an interesting volume. Miss\r\nBird, with a horse and buggy, drove hundreds of miles, sometimes forty\r\nfrom one house to the next. There were almost no railroad facilities\r\nafter leaving the Black Hills district but armed with suffrage\r\nliterature she drove her trusty steed from place to place, spreading\r\nthe gospel of suffrage at school houses, private homes or wherever the\r\nopportunity presented and organizing little groups.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1912, Mrs. Pyle called a convention at Huron, where the\r\ndecision was made to ask the Legislature of 1913 to submit a full\r\nsuffrage amendment. Officers were re-elected, Mrs. Nina Pettigrew of\r\nBelle Fourche took charge of the northwest district in place of Miss\r\nBird, who had resigned, and the president was directed to select her\r\nLegislative Committee. It consisted of the Rev. Katherine Powell, Mrs.\r\nBillinghurst, Mrs. Ruth B. Hipple of Pierre, Miss Bird for the State\r\nFranchise League and Mrs. Simmons of Faulkton; the State president,\r\nMrs. Ruby Jackson of Ipswich, and Miss Rose Bower of Rapid City for\r\nthe W. C. T. U.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1913, Mrs. Pyle and her lieutenants met at Pierre, the\r\ncapital, prepared for action. The hard work, the deep devotion to the\r\ncause of the men and women of preceding years had begun to bear fruit\r\nand instead of finding a lone member here and there in favor of woman\r\nsuffrage, now there were many. Hitherto it had been solely a woman's\r\ncampaign, aided by only a few loyal men who dared brave the ridicule\r\nof their brothers. The years of education had begun to change public\r\nopinion and the president felt that the time for women to be\r\nbuttonholing unwilling men in the lobbies in an apologetic manner was\r\npast. She called a conference of leading men from both Houses to meet\r\nwith the Legislative Committee in the office of Attorney General Royal\r\nC. Johnson. This call met with a hearty response and plans were made\r\nwhich proved so effective that the amendment resolution was the first\r\nmeasure to pass the Legislature, almost before the opponents knew the\r\nsuffragists were on the ground. The poll had been so quietly and\r\ncarefully taken that the committee knew its exact strength in both\r\nHouses almost before the resolution was on the calendar. Governor\r\nFrank M. Byrne gave his valuable assistance, as he had done when a\r\nmember of the Senate in preceding years. Mrs. Byrne also was an\r\nexcellent ally.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Legislature always referred to this legislative\r\nwork as \"the campaign of Committee Room 2,\" as this room beside the\r\nelevator in the House side of the Capitol had been placed at the\r\ndisposal of the suffragists. Their committee quietly stayed there\r\nwhile members were summoned one by one, interviewed and pledged if\r\npossible. Unsuspecting members, supposing they were summoned by some\r\nState official, would come and then would consider it such a good joke\r\nthat they would say nothing and wait for their neighbor to get caught,\r\nso that nearly the entire membership was interviewed before the men\r\nbegan to compare notes.\r\n\r\nAmong many amusing incidents was the following: The suffrage question\r\ncould always be depended upon to fill the galleries and call forth\r\nfloods of oratory. When it was up for discussion at this time Senator\r\nJames Mather of Brown county rose and announced in no uncertain terms\r\nthat he was unalterably opposed; he did not believe in woman suffrage;\r\nit would afford him great satisfaction, indeed he craved the\r\nopportunity, to be recorded as voting against it. The roll-call\r\nstarted alphabetically and it went Aye-Aye-Aye down to M. When the\r\nname Mather was called the Senator, looking decidedly embarrassed,\r\nasked to be excused from voting. Protests came from all sides. Senator\r\nNorbeck (afterwards Governor) in stentorian tones demanded that since\r\nthe Senator had craved the opportunity to record his opinion he should\r\ndo it now. Senator Mather meekly cast the only dissenting vote and\r\nnever was returned to the Legislature. In the Lower House the vote was\r\n70 ayes, 30 noes.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1914 received most important and highly valued\r\nassistance from Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, president of the National\r\nAmerican Suffrage Association; Miss Jane Addams, its vice-president;\r\nMrs. Catharine Waugh McCulloch, Mrs. Ella S. Stewart and Mrs. Florence\r\nBennett Peterson, all of Chicago, and from many others. One of the\r\nbest educational forces was the _South Dakota Messenger_, a weekly\r\npaper controlled and edited by the State organization. It had a wide\r\ncirculation and was able to reach into the farthest corners of the\r\nState. Other papers clipped freely from its editorial and news\r\ncolumns. On November 3 the amendment received 39,605 ayes and 51,519\r\nnoes, lost by nearly 12,000. For the fifth time the men of South\r\nDakota had denied their women the right of representation in the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe suffrage leaders were not in the least daunted or discouraged and\r\na convention was very soon called at Huron to decide whether or not\r\nresubmission should be asked of the Legislature the next year and the\r\nunanimous decision was that it should be. The district plan was\r\nabandoned and county organization adopted. A \"budget\" was prepared and\r\neach county assessed according to its population, which plan was\r\ngenerally successful.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1915, the Legislative Committee, this time composed of\r\nMrs. Pyle, Mrs. Etta Estey Boyce of Sioux Falls and Mrs. Paul Rewman\r\nof Deadwood, assisted by a number of Pierre suffragists for the\r\nUniversal Franchise League and Dr. Mary Noyes Farr of Pierre and Miss\r\nRose Bower for the W. C. T. U., once more climbed the steps of the\r\nCapitol to ask for another referendum. Once more the request was\r\ngranted--in the Senate by 29 to 15, in the House by 57 to 40--during\r\nthe first two weeks of the session. A reception was given by the\r\ncommittee and Pierre suffragists to the members of the Legislature,\r\nthe State officers and the ladies of their families in the ballroom of\r\nthe St. George Hotel, said to have been a social event second only to\r\nthe inaugural ball. Later in the session a bill to give women a vote\r\nfor presidential electors, county and municipal officers, which could\r\nbe granted by the Legislature itself, received 59 ayes and 40 noes in\r\nthe House; 18 ayes and 24 noes in the Senate.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1916 for the first time the women \"antis\" deemed\r\nit necessary to do active work. They established headquarters at the\r\ncapital with a manager in charge and made an open campaign. To answer\r\ntheir old stock argument, \"Women do not want the vote,\" a state-wide\r\nplan of petitions by the women of each county was adopted and every\r\none where the work was well done showed a good majority in favor. On\r\nNovember 7 when the first election returns came from those counties\r\nthat usually indicate the result of the whole State, the Associated\r\nPress sent the news broadcast that South Dakota had been carried for\r\nwoman suffrage by a large majority, but again it was the same old\r\nstory, principally the foreigners, especially the Germans, had once\r\nmore denied to American women the privilege which they, themselves,\r\nhad acquired so easily. The returns showed 53,432 in the affirmative;\r\n58,350 in the negative, an opposing majority of less than 5,000.\r\n\r\nEach campaign had shown a growth in favorable sentiment and there\r\nseemed every reason to believe that another one would be successful.\r\nThe National Association agreed with the State in this opinion and\r\nwere ready to cooperate, so it seemed best to ask the session of 1917\r\nto give one more opportunity. The Legislature was well trained by this\r\ntime and willingly passed the resolution, the Senate by 31 ayes, 12\r\nnoes; the House by 66 ayes, 27 noes. After it had adjourned and before\r\ndefinite plans for a campaign were completed the country was plunged\r\ninto the World War and misgivings arose in the minds of the executive\r\nboard as to the wisdom of an undertaking which would make demands on\r\nthe time of the women. After much prayerful deliberation the unanimous\r\ndecision was reached that since this war was being fought for the\r\nestablishment of world democracy and this question was undoubtedly one\r\nof democracy, there must be no turning back, but that the campaign\r\nmust be managed in such a way as to require the services of as few\r\nwomen as possible. No further effort was made to organize county\r\nleagues but a committee of three was elected in each county to look\r\nafter its interests except in those already well organized. Not much\r\nwas done this year beyond laying a foundation for the necessary work\r\nof the next year.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1918, Governor Peter Norbeck called a special session of\r\nthe Legislature to consider important State affairs, one being to\r\nchange the clause in the constitution relating to citizenship. Its\r\nframers, to render settlement of a new, undeveloped country\r\nattractive, made the requirement such that a foreigner might become a\r\nqualified elector after having merely declared his intention of\r\nbecoming a citizen, without having sworn allegiance to the United\r\nStates. Thousands of aliens had taken out their first papers, filed on\r\ngovernment land, proved up and established their homes, failed to\r\ncomplete their naturalization and yet were fully qualified to vote.\r\nThis had long been considered a menace to the government and\r\nsuffragists knew that it was principally to this class of voters that\r\nthey owed their many defeats. The war developed great disloyalty among\r\nthis class and the Governor announced that the situation was\r\nintolerable and the requirements for citizenship must be changed. In\r\norder to do this it was necessary to amend the section of the\r\nconstitution which stated the qualifications of a voter and which was\r\nthe same section that it was sought to amend for woman suffrage by\r\nstriking out the word \"male.\" It was finally decided that the only way\r\nwas to have the two matters submitted as one amendment. The word\r\n\"male\" was stricken out and full naturalization and a five years'\r\nresidence were required before the privilege of voting should be\r\ngranted and this was substituted for the original suffrage amendment.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a report made to the national executive board Mrs.\r\nMcMahon, one of its organizers, said:\r\n\r\n     There was a conference in the headquarters at Huron and Mrs. Pyle\r\n     faced the situation and took up the burden. The National Suffrage\r\n     Association had sent two field workers--Miss Mary Elizabeth\r\n     Pidgeon and Mrs. Albert McMahon. To the latter was given charge\r\n     of the organization department and together the two women set to\r\n     work with the State officers to district the State and organize\r\n     in each county a campaign committee. Eventually there was an\r\n     organizer for every six districts, each comprising from twelve to\r\n     fourteen huge counties. Each worker as she came into the State\r\n     had to be carefully instructed in everything that touched upon\r\n     the constitutional provisions for voting, the status of the\r\n     alien, the reason for putting the citizenship clause into the\r\n     suffrage amendment, the effect its passage would have upon the\r\n     aliens, etc., because these questions were constantly met. Much\r\n     new literature had to be prepared and all the posters changed to\r\n     fit new conditions.\r\n\r\n     What won the State? Persistent, intensive, quiet work. We had few\r\n     meetings of our own but we used those of every one else, from\r\n     women's aid societies to Rotary clubs, political rallies and\r\n     Fourth of July celebrations. We did not plan parades, but\r\n     wherever patriotic sentiment expressed itself through a parade we\r\n     were in it. We circularized the voters in groups again and\r\n     again--lawyers, business men, farmers, etc., with literature\r\n     adapted to each group. We circulated a petition and 95 per cent.\r\n     of the women to whom it was presented signed it. We sent every\r\n     organizer we could command into delinquent counties, having the\r\n     cooperation of the local women. In the evening street meetings\r\n     were held. The workers left literature in every home and posters\r\n     placarded on every wall space. They left suffrage stories with\r\n     the newspapers and the spoken word in the ear of all who would\r\n     listen and they left the morale of the local workers at high\r\n     water mark. The signed petitions were printed and mailed to the\r\n     voters in each county with our final circularization.\r\n     Ninety-eight per cent. of the newspapers were favorable and in\r\n     spite of paper shortage and the demand for war publicity they\r\n     never failed the women. In addition to news stories, editorials,\r\n     etc., they universally used the plate material which the National\r\n     Association furnished. As much as any other one thing perhaps,\r\n     this plate material helped to win the campaign. All political\r\n     parties endorsed the amendment, Republicans and Democrats making\r\n     it a part of their platforms.\r\n\r\n     In June Mrs. Nettie Rogers Shuler, corresponding secretary of the\r\n     National Association, came to South Dakota and with Mrs. S. V.\r\n     Ghrist, vice-president of the State League, and Mrs. McMahon, a\r\n     school of methods was held in the principal towns. The women were\r\n     taught how to organize and were grounded in the new aspects of\r\n     the campaign. Mrs. Catt was ill and could not come, which was the\r\n     greatest blow the campaign had; however Mrs. Halsey W. Wilson,\r\n     national recording secretary, took her place very acceptably.\r\n\r\nAmong the organizers Mrs. McMahon mentioned Mrs. R. E. H. Stevens,\r\nMiss Stella Crosley, Miss Gertrude Watkins, Miss Josephine Miller,\r\nMiss Liba Peshokova and Miss Ida Stadie and said: \"But this efficient,\r\nfaithful little band could not have won the campaign alone. South\r\nDakota State women will perhaps never realize how much they owe to\r\nMrs. John L. Pyle, president, who gave herself absolutely to the\r\nwinning of their political freedom. She was at her desk from early in\r\nthe morning until 11 o'clock and later at night. Nothing was allowed\r\nto stand in the way of her complete service. The best there was in her\r\nshe gave to the cause and she has the gratitude of those for whom and\r\nwith whom she worked. Ably seconding her efforts were Mrs. Ghrist,\r\nvice-president; Mrs. Frank Meyer, office secretary; Mrs. Rewman and\r\nMiss Alice Lorraine Daly in the finance department; Mrs. Lewis L.\r\nLeavitt, chairman of the Minnehaha committee; Miss Harriet Grant of\r\nHuron and Mrs. R. H. Lewis of Mitchell. The whole structure rested on\r\nthe county workers. There was never a Fair that was not covered nor a\r\nTeachers' nor a Farmers' Institute nor a political meeting. Everywhere\r\nthat voters gathered, there they were.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be presumed that those who would be disfranchised until they\r\nhad completed their naturalization would cast their votes against the\r\namendment but these were more than counteracted by American citizens,\r\nwho, even if they did not believe in woman suffrage, would vote for\r\nthe amendment because of this part of it. The election took place Nov.\r\n6, 1918, and the amendment received 49,318 ayes and 28,934 noes;\r\ncarried by 20,384. The following figures show the progress made from\r\ncampaign to campaign: Opposing majority in 1910, 22,419; in 1914,\r\n11,914; in 1916, 4,934.\r\n\r\nThe women of South Dakota are deeply grateful to the National American\r\nWoman Suffrage Association, which always helped generously with\r\norganizers, speakers and money. It contributed $7,500 to this\r\ncampaign. Various States were loyal and helpful and have the fullest\r\nappreciation and gratitude.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. The final scene in the drama of woman suffrage was\r\nstaged on December 4, 1919, at 12:40 a. m., when the members of the\r\nLegislature, coming to Pierre at their own expense and at great\r\ninconvenience, in the middle of winter, unanimously ratified the\r\nFederal Suffrage Amendment. Many States were having special sessions\r\nfor this purpose but Governor Norbeck, who would have to call one in\r\nJanuary, did not wish to do so before then. He agreed, however, that\r\nif a majority of the members would come to Pierre at their own expense\r\nin order to ratify the amendment, he would call a session for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThis State has a new law which requires that in December of the year\r\npreceding an election there shall be \"proposal meetings\" held at the\r\ncapital to propose candidates for nomination at the March primaries,\r\neach party holding a separate meeting. This year there were to be also\r\nthree party conventions at the same time and practically all the\r\npoliticians would be at the capital. Mrs. Pyle and her board asked the\r\nGovernor to call the session for that time, for many of the members\r\nwould be in attendance as delegates from their counties. Accordingly,\r\nafter receiving the assurance that a majority of them were willing to\r\ncome to Pierre at their own expense, he issued a call for December 3\r\nat 7 o'clock in the evening. It was dead of winter and distances are\r\nlong. The call was issued after 3 o'clock on Saturday and the session\r\nwas to be the next Tuesday. Telephone and telegraph wires were kept\r\nhumming for the next thirty-six hours and the men came from all\r\ndirections. One man rushed home to Huron from Minneapolis, called to\r\nhis wife to send his \"grip\" after him and just caught the train for\r\nPierre. Another used up three automobiles getting to the train from\r\nhis home many miles from the railroad, as the snow made the roads\r\nalmost impassable.\r\n\r\nThe question arose how to put the resolution through the two Houses in\r\nthe least possible time. It was finally done by introducing the\r\nresolutions in both Houses and giving them their first and second\r\nreadings on the evening of December 3. They were then referred to the\r\nproper committees and the Legislature adjourned until the next\r\nlegislative day. The earliest possible moment of the next day was one\r\nminute after midnight and this was the hour when it convened. The\r\nfinal passage took place at 12:44 a. m. on the 4th by unanimous vote.\r\nThis was the first time that a South Dakota Legislature ever convened\r\nin the middle of the night but the members were anxious to get home as\r\nsoon as possible and the trains leave in both directions about 2 a.\r\nm.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[163] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Ruth B. Hipple,\r\nmember of the Legislative Committee of the State Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation and editor of the _South Dakota Messenger_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nTENNESSEE. PART I.[164]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the suffrage movement in Tennessee filled only five\r\npages of the volume preceding this one, which ended with 1900, and\r\nsuch as there was had been due principally to that dauntless pioneer,\r\nMrs. Lide A. Meriwether of Memphis, to whom this chapter is reverently\r\nand gratefully dedicated. The first suffrage society was formed in\r\nMemphis in May, 1889, and none of its founders is now living except\r\nMrs. J. D. Allen of this city. In April, 1894, a society was formed at\r\nNashville at the home of Mrs. H. C. Gardner by Miss Amelia Territt,\r\nMrs. Bettie Donelson and a few others but it had no connection with\r\nthe one at Memphis. Its members were earnest and capable but it did\r\nnot long survive. Through the efforts of the National Association a\r\nState organization was effected in 1897, the year of the Centennial\r\nExposition in Nashville, and there was a convention in April, 1900,\r\nattended by Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, national president. There had\r\nbeen no State convention for five years when in 1906, through the\r\ninitiative of Miss Belle Kearney of Mississippi a meeting was called\r\nin Memphis of which Miss Laura Clay of Kentucky sends the following\r\naccount taken from her scrapbook:\r\n\r\n     The conference of Southern Women Suffragists was held in Memphis\r\n     December 19, 20, the opening session in the morning at the\r\n     Peabody Hotel; the afternoon session at the residence of Mrs. J.\r\n     O. Crawford and the other sessions at the hotel. Miss Clay was\r\n     elected chairman; Mrs. Nannie Curtiss of Texas, secretary. The\r\n     meeting included representatives from many of the southern States\r\n     and letters were received from \"Dorothy Dix,\" Mrs. Caroline E.\r\n     Merrick and Mrs. Sophy Wright of New Orleans; Mrs. Mary Bentley\r\n     Thomas of Baltimore; Mrs. Josephine K. Henry of Versailles, Ky.;\r\n     Mrs. Eliza Strong Tracey of Houston; Mrs. Mary B. Clay and Mrs.\r\n     James Bennett of Richmond, Ky., and Mrs. Key, president of the\r\n     North Texas Girls' College. Discussions on aspects of the\r\n     suffrage question were led by Miss Kearney, Miss Clay, Mrs.\r\n     Meriwether and Mrs. Jennie H. Sibley of Georgia. The conference\r\n     was resolved into a committee of the whole to formulate plans for\r\n     concerted legislative work in the southern States. A thousand\r\n     copies of the resolutions were printed. At this time the State\r\n     Equal Suffrage Association was re-organized, with Mrs. Meriwether\r\n     honorary president; Mrs. J. D. Allen, president; Mrs. L. F.\r\n     Selden, corresponding secretary and treasurer; Mrs. M. M. Betts,\r\n     recording secretary; Mrs. S. S. Deem, chairman of problems\r\n     affecting women or children.\r\n\r\nMrs. Allen served continuously until 1912. In 1908 the State\r\nFederation of Labor not only endorsed woman suffrage but agreed to\r\npetition members of the Legislature and Congress to work for it and\r\nthey loyally kept their pledge. This same year suffrage literature was\r\nfirst distributed at the State Federation of Women's Clubs and Dr.\r\nShaw, then president of the National Association, spoke in Memphis.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 the first suffrage State petition work was begun in Memphis\r\nand its Nineteenth Century Club and the Newman Circle of Knoxville\r\nheld parlor meetings and discussions. Knoxville formed a local league;\r\nthe women's clubs began to awaken and the State Federation appointed\r\nits first legislative committee, with the object of having the laws\r\nunfavorable to women changed. In 1911 thousands of pieces of\r\nliterature were distributed, press articles sent out and a resolution\r\nto amend the State constitution by striking out the word \"male\" was\r\nfirst presented to the Legislature. The movement did not gain much\r\nimpetus until the Nashville League was organized in the fall of this\r\nyear and Chattanooga and Morrison soon followed. On Jan. 10-12, 1912,\r\nthe association with its five virile infant leagues met in Nashville\r\nand plans for state-wide organization began. Miss Sarah Barnwell\r\nElliott, an eminent writer, was unanimously chosen president. In\r\nOctober, 1913, the State convention met in Morristown and eight\r\nleagues answered the roll call.\r\n\r\nThe work in the Legislature naturally always fell heavily upon the\r\nNashville League and from 1913 to 1919 the lobby was composed\r\nprincipally of its members. The first real effort to break down the\r\nprejudice of the legislators was in 1913, when Miss Elliott and Mrs.\r\nGuilford Dudley asked for an audience for Miss Laura Clay, president\r\nof the Kentucky association, and Miss Mary Johnston of Virginia, the\r\nnovelist. This was granted and Miss Elliott was the first woman to\r\naddress the Legislature, although no bill was before it.\r\n\r\nAt a called meeting of the Executive Board, at Memphis in May, 1914,\r\nthe resignation of Miss Elliott was regretfully accepted and Mrs. L.\r\nCrozier French succeeded her. At the State convention held October 29,\r\n30 in Knoxville a division occurred and some of the delegates,\r\nrefusing to be headed by Mrs. French, elected as president Mrs. James\r\nM. McCormack, who was first vice-president. Mrs. French was\r\nunanimously elected by a part of the original association, which had\r\nobtained a charter October 13, incorporating the name Tennessee Equal\r\nSuffrage Association. This association continued to be a dominating\r\nforce in suffrage activities. Mrs. French resigned the presidency\r\nApril 1, 1915, and her unexpired term was filled by the\r\nvice-president-at-large, Mrs. John M. Kenny of Nashville. The holding\r\nof the annual convention of the National Association in Nashville Nov.\r\n12-17, 1914, was the turning point in the history of suffrage in\r\nTennessee because of its far-reaching educational propaganda and\r\nbecause Nashville was the political center of the State.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dudley was elected president at the State convention held at\r\nJackson in October, 1915. She went to east, west and middle Tennessee,\r\nvisiting in the first year of her administration nineteen towns, many\r\nof them twice, and assisting the Campaign Committee in organizing\r\nfourteen. She made addresses in twenty-two different cities. Toward\r\nthe end of the year Miss Sue S. White, of Jackson, the recording\r\nsecretary, a court stenographer and business woman, gave a month to\r\norganizing the headquarters staff and making plans to carry forward\r\nthe work in a businesslike way.[165]\r\n\r\nMrs. Catt was making a strong effort to have the various States follow\r\nthe same policy at the same time and thereby each could contribute to\r\nthe national victory. With the view of securing woman suffrage planks\r\nin both Democratic and Republican national platforms, each association\r\nwas asked to secure endorsement from its political State conventions.\r\nEarly in January, 1916, Mrs. Dudley and Mrs. Kenny went before the\r\nexecutive committees of both parties, asking for a plank in the\r\nplatforms and also that delegates be instructed to vote for a suffrage\r\nplank in the national platform this year. In May Mrs. Dudley spoke\r\nbefore the platform committees and the conventions of both endorsed\r\nwoman suffrage. Former Governor Ben Hooper, Mr. and Mrs. James S.\r\nBeasley, the Hon. H. Clay Evans and Harry Anderson were of much\r\nassistance with the Republicans and Governor Tom C. Rye and U. S.\r\nSenator Kenneth D. McKellar secured the resolution from the Democrats.\r\n\r\nTennessee sent seven women to the Republican national convention in\r\nChicago, who marched in the famous parade through wind and rain to the\r\nconvention hall, Mrs. Dudley carrying the State suffrage banner.\r\nEleven women went to the Democratic national convention in St. Louis,\r\nwhere they stood bravely in the \"golden lane\" through which the\r\ndelegates marched to the convention. Mrs. Dudley was chosen to address\r\nthe Tennessee delegation and it was a proud moment for the women of\r\nthe State when they voted solidly for the suffrage plank. In October\r\nfarewell banquets to congressmen on the eve of their departure for\r\nWashington, to influence their votes for the Federal Suffrage\r\nAmendment, were given in Knoxville, Nashville and Memphis. The State\r\nFederation of Women's Clubs endorsed woman suffrage this year by a\r\nlarge majority, under the leadership of Mrs. George Fort Milton of\r\nChattanooga and Mrs. D. T. Kimbrough of Nashville. Other endorsements\r\nwere those of the Southern Federation of Labor (unanimous), obtained\r\nthrough the efforts of Mrs. Walter Jackson of Murfreesboro; the\r\nTennessee Women's Press and Authors' Club, through Miss Libbie Morrow;\r\nthe State conventions of the Beemen, the Nurserymen and the\r\nHorticulturists, at the request of Mrs. Kimbrough.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dudley soon came to be known nationally. She spoke on the Federal\r\nAmendment at the luncheon of four hundred given to the incoming\r\nmembers at the Congress Hotel in Washington; addressed congressional\r\ncommittee hearings, and in December she joined the \"lobby\" at the\r\nnational suffrage headquarters in Washington to interview southern\r\nSenators and Representatives. The State convention was held in\r\nNashville, Jan. 30, 31, 1917. Mrs. Dudley was unanimously re-elected\r\nand served until her election to the board of the National Association\r\nin December. At this convention Mrs. Kenny was elected chairman of\r\npublicity and under her direction special suffrage editions of\r\nnewspapers were published in the principal towns and cities and copies\r\nmailed to every voter. The plate matter sent out by the national press\r\ncommittee was widely distributed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Leslie Warner was elected president in 1918, and at the State\r\nconvention held in Nashville in June, 1919, Mrs. George Fort Milton\r\nsucceeded her. During her seven years of suffrage activity Mrs. Milton\r\nhad rendered valuable service in various official positions. It was\r\nwhile this convention was in session that the news came of the\r\nsubmission of the Federal Suffrage Amendment by Congress and there was\r\na demonstration of joy. In the evening a brilliant public banquet took\r\nplace at the Tulane Hotel. The convention extended its official board\r\nto include a chairman from each congressional district, for the\r\nratification campaign. Three weeks later the board held a meeting at\r\nLookout Mountain, formulated plans for organizing the districts\r\npolitically and pledged the largest amount of money for State work in\r\nthe history of the association.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE WORK. In 1915 Mrs. L. Crozier French, State president,\r\nappointed Mrs. Guilford Dudley, president of the Nashville League,\r\nlegislative chairman to sponsor a resolution for a woman suffrage\r\namendment to the State constitution. The members of the lobby\r\ncommittee were Mrs. Kenny, Mrs. Kimbrough, Mrs. W. G. Spencer, Mrs.\r\nReau E. Folk, Mrs. Ittie K. Reno, Mrs. Victoria James Roach and Mrs.\r\nA. Y. Scott. To amend the constitution it is necessary to obtain a\r\nmajority in the first Legislature and a two-thirds majority in the\r\nsucceeding one before the question is submitted to the voters. In\r\nJanuary when the House committee met to report on the amendment it was\r\nopposed almost to a man. Mrs. Dudley with all her committee back of\r\nher made an eloquent appeal for justice and fair play, urging them at\r\nleast to permit the House to vote on the measure. When she finished\r\nnot a man raised his voice against it. The House adjourned to permit\r\nMrs. Dudley and Mrs. Scott to speak to the members and the final roll\r\ncall registered only fourteen noes. It passed the Senate with only\r\nthree dissenting votes. The leagues all over the State had brought\r\nstrong pressure to bear upon their representatives. In 1917 it was\r\nreplaced by the Presidential suffrage bill.\r\n\r\nOn May 17 a conference was held at Tullahoma, where the Campaign\r\nCommittee was formed. Two joint-chairmen headed the executive\r\ncommittee, Mrs. Kenny and Mrs. Henry J. Kelso of Knoxville, with Mrs.\r\nScott vice-chairman. On the resignation of Mrs. Kelso, Mrs. Milton was\r\nelected in her place.[166] Miss Elizabeth Breen, executive secretary,\r\ngave untiring and efficient service. Headquarters were opened in\r\nNashville. This Campaign Committee was the trail-blazer. Although in\r\noperation only seven months it organized thirty-two leagues; enrolled\r\n9,600 names; printed and distributed 75,000 pieces of literature and\r\nexpended on organization work over $4,000. State-wide publicity was\r\ngained; the workers received valuable training in organizing and\r\npublic speaking and it was a harmonizing force.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to enlist Tennessee suffragists in street speaking,\r\nnot that they had not the courage of their faith but they feared to\r\nviolate the conservative traditions of their southland. After seeing\r\nits wonderful effect during the national suffrage convention in\r\nAtlantic City in 1916 a few of the bold-hearted summoned courage and\r\nthe first attempt was made in Jackson and Memphis in 1917 by Mrs.\r\nKimbrough, Mrs. Kenny, Mrs. Jackson, Mrs. Reno and Miss White. At the\r\nState Fair in Nashville in 1918 the Campaign Committee took charge of\r\nthe open air meetings, these women speaking eight or ten times each\r\nday, and they were rewarded by the great number of enrollment cards\r\nsigned by those who received the message favorably.\r\n\r\nIn 1917 the legislative campaign was conducted under the friendly\r\nadministration of a Democratic Governor, Tom C. Rye, and under the\r\ndirection of Mrs. Dudley, State president, and Mrs. Ezzell,\r\nlegislative chairman. Before direct plans had been made, advices came\r\nfrom the National Association to concentrate on a Presidential and\r\nMunicipal suffrage bill similar to that passed in Illinois in 1913.\r\nThis was agreed upon and General G. T. Fitzhugh of Memphis drew up the\r\nbill. His services were of great value to suffrage interests because\r\nboth as a citizen and a member of the bar he was held in the highest\r\nesteem. From this time until the State Supreme Court decision of 1919\r\nremoved the last barrier to this bill he was a valued friend and\r\nadviser, and was associate counsel in the last legal battle on\r\nratification from the Chancery to the Supreme Court--all without\r\nfinancial remuneration.\r\n\r\nThis Presidential and Municipal suffrage bill was one of the first\r\nintroduced, sponsored in the House by Speaker Clyde Shropshire and in\r\nthe Senate by C. W. Rocks of Humboldt, and its progress was watched\r\nwith great interest. Petitions were sent to the members from all parts\r\nof the State. The Memphis and Nashville members were solid for it from\r\nthe beginning with one exception--Senator John M. Thompson, a violent\r\n\"anti\" from Nashville. Both suffragists and \"antis\" were invited to\r\nspeak before the House Judiciary Committee and both accepted, but\r\nafter two postponements through courtesy the \"antis\" did not put in an\r\nappearance and the suffragists alone were heard. General Fitzhugh came\r\nto speak for the bill. There had been much discussion as to its\r\nvalidity without the insertion of a poll tax clause and it was in\r\njeopardy. An appeal was made to a friend whose legal advice and\r\nservices the suffragists had always had for the asking--General\r\nCharles T. Cates, Jr., Attorney General, who came from his home in\r\nKnoxville to construe for the committee some of the perplexing phases\r\nand the committee unanimously recommended the bill.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to a vote in the House women from all sections of the\r\nState were present. Among the most untiring workers were George Fort\r\nMilton, editor of the Chattanooga _News_, and Mrs. Milton; Miss\r\nMargaret Ervin of Chattanooga; Mrs. Isaac Reese, Mrs. Harry Anderson\r\nand Mrs. Scott of Memphis; Miss White, Mrs. Kimbrough and Mrs. Kenny.\r\nMany members of the Nashville League served at frequent critical\r\ntimes. The vote in the House was 59 ayes, 25 noes, on Jan. 19, 1917,\r\nLee's birthday, an anniversary celebrated throughout the South, and it\r\nwas fittingly referred to by some of the members as an appropriate\r\noccasion for Southern men to give justice to women. Following its\r\npassage the Hon. William Jennings Bryan, who was in Nashville, was\r\ninvited to address the Legislature and spoke strongly in favor of it.\r\nMrs. Bryan accompanied him and at a luncheon given in her honor at the\r\nHermitage Hotel, attended by members of the Legislature and over two\r\nhundred guests, she made an eloquent plea for suffrage and Mr. Bryan\r\nspoke again.\r\n\r\nWhile this bill was pending in the Senate the newspapers throughout\r\nthe State were giving much more publicity to woman suffrage than they\r\nhad ever done before. Many of the county papers favored it and\r\npublished matter sent them. The _Labor World_ gave continuous support.\r\nSome of the best suffragists were newspaper women and they gave freely\r\nof their time and talents. The excellent service of Mrs. W. A. Overall\r\nis recalled; though not a \"professional\" her clear, logical articles\r\nimpressed impartial readers. Of the large daily papers the Knoxville\r\n_Sentinel_ and the _Commercial Appeal_ and _News Scimitar_ of Memphis\r\nwere favorable. The Jackson _Daily Sun_ and the Nashville _Banner_\r\nwere opposed. The Chattanooga _News_ was an ardent advocate, while the\r\nChattanooga _Times_, under the control of the New York _Times_, was\r\nstrongly opposed. The Nashville _Tennesseean_ was regarded as the\r\nofficial organ of the suffragists. Its owner, former U. S. Senator\r\nLuke Lea, while in the Senate in 1913 had been one of three southern\r\nSenators to vote for the Federal Amendment. Throughout the campaign he\r\nwas ready at all times to help in every way possible, ignoring his\r\npersonal political interests. This was true of U. S. Senator McKellar\r\nand Governor Rye.\r\n\r\nWhen the first canvass of the Senate was made the sentiment was about\r\nas follows: For the bill 11; unalterably opposed, 7; uncertain, 15.\r\nThe classification \"uncertain\" was most appropriate, for fifteen more\r\nuncertain men were never encountered. When assured that the measure\r\ncould safely be brought to vote it would be discovered that changes\r\nhad occurred over night which would mean defeat. The \"antis\" worked\r\nthrough a hastily organized local society at Nashville, which was\r\ninspired by Judge John J. Vertrees, a prominent lawyer of that city. A\r\nCharles McLean of Iowa, who had been used by the opponents in other\r\nState suffrage campaigns, made two or three visits to Nashville during\r\nthe session. The State suffrage convention in this city a few days\r\nbefore the bill came to a vote in the Senate was the largest ever held\r\nand many delegates remained for the vote.\r\n\r\nThe bill was introduced by Senator C. W. Rooks, who with Senator John\r\nC. Houk led the fight for it. It was lost on February 3 by 21 noes, 12\r\nayes. A motion to reconsider by Senator A. E. Hill carried it over\r\nuntil the Legislature reconvened on March 7. The generosity of Mrs.\r\nScott, vice-chairman of the Campaign Committee, who gave $500, enabled\r\nthe State association to employ four organizers and the National\r\nAssociation paid the salaries of three more. New organizations were\r\nformed and remote towns, which had scarcely ever heard of suffrage,\r\nwere visited. A telegram from President Wilson urging the Senate to\r\npass the bill was received at the March session but was not read in\r\nthat body until the day after it was defeated.[167] The motion for\r\nreconsideration was laid on the table the first day by 18 ayes, 10\r\nnoes.\r\n\r\nIncessant work in behalf of the bill was carried on in the districts\r\nof hostile or doubtful Senators from September until January, 1919,\r\nwhen the Legislature met and the bill for Presidential and Municipal\r\nsuffrage was again introduced. It was a hard fight for many weeks made\r\nby Mrs. Warner and her committee, with daily, continuous work at the\r\nCapitol and \"back log\" work through the State, where she had the\r\nconstant help of her board. Mrs. A. G. Buckner, as legislative\r\nchairman, worked unceasingly, as did Mrs. Margaret Ervin Ford, Mrs.\r\nReno and Miss Matilda Porter, the lobby committee, assisted by Miss\r\nJosephine Miller, a national organizer. Mrs. Dudley came after the\r\nnational suffrage convention in March.\r\n\r\nAttorney L. D. Miller of Chattanooga introduced the bill in the House\r\nand conducted the fight for it. It passed the third and final reading\r\nApril 3 by 52 ayes, 32 noes. Speaker Seth M. Walker of Wilson county\r\nbecame a convert and eloquent advocate, leaving his desk to plead for\r\nit. [See Ratification.]\r\n\r\nAfter the bill had been cleverly put to sleep by the President of the\r\nSenate, Andrew Todd, by referring it to the hostile Judiciary\r\nCommittee, Senator E. N. Haston, who was its sponsor, secured enough\r\nvotes to overrule his action and put it in the Committee on Privileges\r\nand Elections, which reported in favor. The enemies were led by\r\nSenator J. Parks Worley. The hardest fight that ever took place in the\r\nSenate was waged, and the outcome was not certain until Judge Douglas\r\nWikle of Williamson county cast the deciding vote in favor, making the\r\nresult on April 16, ayes, 17; noes, 14, a bare majority. At 10:30 the\r\nfollowing morning Governor Roberts affixed his signature to the Act\r\nconferring upon women the right to vote for electors of President and\r\nVice-President of the United States and in the Municipal elections\r\nthroughout the State. More than half a million women were thus far\r\nenfranchised.\r\n\r\nConspicuous and persistent among the enemies of the bill outside of\r\nthe Legislature were U. S. Senator John K. Shields and Judge Vertrees.\r\nThe latter, claiming to represent \"others\" filed a writ of injunction\r\nin the Chancery Court to test the validity of the law. Attorney\r\nGeneral Frank M. Thompson and other able lawyers defended this\r\nsuit[168], which was hotly contested, and this court, by Chancellor\r\nJames B. Newman, in June declared the law unconstitutional. The case\r\nwas appealed to the State Supreme Court, which in July, 1919, reversed\r\nthis decision and declared the law valid.\r\n\r\nWhen the Supreme Court rendered this decision the regular biennial\r\nregistration was only ten days off and it was at the hottest period of\r\nthe summer, when many women and most of the suffrage officials were\r\nout of town, but the registration was large in all the cities. In\r\nNashville about 7,500 registered; in Knoxville about 7,000, and the\r\ntype of those who presented themselves everywhere was of the highest\r\nand best. Contrary to all predictions the negro women did not flock to\r\nthe polls. They voted but in comparatively few numbers and the records\r\nshow that only the better educated were interested. Their vote proved\r\nto be anything but the \"bugaboo\" politicians had tried to show that it\r\nwould be and in some instances it was a contributing factor to good\r\ngovernment. In Nashville they registered about 2,500 and voted almost\r\ntheir full quota. They organized under the direction of the suffrage\r\nassociation, had their own city and ward chairmen and worked with an\r\nintelligence, loyalty and dignity that made new friends for their race\r\nand for woman suffrage. There was not a single adverse criticism of\r\nthem from any ward. They kept faith with the white women even when\r\nsome of their men sold out the night before election to a notorious\r\npolitical rounder. They proved that they were trying to keep step with\r\nthe march of progress and with a little patience, trust and vision the\r\nuniversal tie of motherhood and sisterhood can and will overcome the\r\nprejudice against them as voters.\r\n\r\nAn immense amount of work was done by Tennessee women for the Federal\r\nSuffrage Amendment. After interviewing their members of Congress and\r\nusing every possible influence on them in their home districts,\r\nhundreds of letters and telegrams were sent to them in Washington\r\nwhenever they were to vote on it from 1915 to 1919. Mrs. Dudley, as a\r\nmember of the national board, spent months in Washington and was sent\r\nto various southern States where skilled work was necessary. There was\r\na gradually increasing vote in favor by Tennessee members until when\r\nthe last one was taken in June, 1919, only three Representatives,\r\nMoon, Hull and Garrett, voted against it. Senator Shields voted in\r\nopposition and Senator McKellar in favor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[With this chapter was sent a complete history of the woman suffrage\r\nmovement in Memphis, Nashville, Knoxville, Chattanooga and smaller\r\ncities, which accounts for the phenomenally rapid advance in\r\nTennessee. Unfortunately these chapters can give space only to the\r\ngeneral work of the State associations.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTENNESSEE. PART II[169]\r\n\r\nTennessee's pioneer period was from 1885-1911, for during those years\r\nthe educational and organization work carried on by a few intrepid\r\nwomen was as difficult as was the same work in other parts of the\r\nUnited States thirty or more years before that time. Woman suffrage\r\nwas in the stage of ridicule and abuse and with a few exceptions the\r\npress of the State was opposed and lost no opportunity to disparage\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe State Equal Suffrage Association was reorganized in Memphis in\r\n1906 and there was increasing activity each year afterwards. In 1907\r\nthe suffragists held a convention and reported their membership\r\ntrebled. They secured a suffrage article in the _News Scimitar_\r\nthrough the courtesy of Mike Connolly, its editor. In 1908 Dr. Shaw\r\nspoke at the Goodwin Hall in Memphis under the auspices of the State\r\nassociation and a return engagement was secured by the Lyceum Course\r\nthe following winter. The third annual convention was held Dec. 15,\r\n1909, in Memphis at the home of the State president, Mrs. J. D. Allen,\r\nand the officers were re-elected. It was reported that a petition had\r\nbeen sent to Congress for a Federal Amendment and more than 400\r\nletters written, one to President Taft asking him to declare for woman\r\nsuffrage and local work had been done. Mrs. E. S. Conser, assisted by\r\nMrs. Allen and the suffrage club, prevailed upon the Memphis\r\nUniversity Law Department to open its doors to women and Mrs. Conser\r\nbecame its first woman student. Mrs. Allen attended the national\r\nconvention at Seattle, Washington. Mrs. Ittie K. Reno delivered the\r\nfirst woman suffrage address in Nashville, at the Centennial Club, and\r\nthe first one in Chattanooga was given by Miss Margaret Ervin at the\r\nuniversity where she was a student.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 a league was organized in Knoxville by Mrs. L. Crozier French,\r\nwho became its president. In the summer a suffrage debate, affirmative\r\ntaken by Mrs. Ford, was held in the Methodist church at Kingston, the\r\nfirst time the question was discussed in that part of the State and\r\npeople came from neighboring towns. Miss Catherine J. Wester, a\r\nKingston suffragist, had a six weeks' newspaper debate in the\r\nChattanooga _Times_. A booth was maintained at the Appalachian\r\nExposition, and 590 names of visitors from Tennessee, Arkansas and\r\nMississippi were registered in the suffrage booth at the Tri-State\r\nfair in September at Memphis.\r\n\r\nThe fourth State convention was held at Memphis in the Business Men's\r\nClub Feb. 18, 1911, and the president, Mrs. Allen, reported suffrage\r\ntrips to Little Rock, Ark., and Jackson, Miss. Addresses were given by\r\nAttorney Robert Beattie and by H. P. Hanson, vice-president of the\r\nSouthern Conference on Child and Woman Labor, who brought word that\r\nthe Memphis Typographical Union was on record for woman suffrage. Mrs.\r\nBeattie was elected vice-president and Dr. Madge Patton Stephens\r\nsecretary. The Nashville club was organized September 28, with Mrs.\r\nGuilford Dudley president; one at Morristown November 3, with Mrs.\r\nHannah Price Hardy president; one at Chattanooga December 9, with Mrs.\r\nE. W. Penticost president.\r\n\r\nBy 1912 a new era had dawned with five of the largest cities organized\r\nand affiliated with the State association. It held its annual\r\nconvention at Nashville January 10-11. Governor Ben W. Hooper\r\naddressed it and stated that he was \"on the fence\" as to the suffrage\r\nquestion. Mrs. Allen was elected honorary president and Miss Sarah\r\nBarnwell Elliott president. Miss Elliott spent two months of this year\r\nspeaking in the State and she also spoke in Birmingham, in New York\r\nand the Mississippi Valley Conference in Chicago. In December a\r\nsuffrage club was organized in Jackson with Mrs. C. B. Bell president.\r\nJ. W. Brister, State Superintendent of Schools, gave a suffrage\r\naddress at Nashville.\r\n\r\nThe State convention was held again at the Hermitage Hotel in\r\nNashville, Jan. 6, 7, 1913. The principal speakers were ex-Governor\r\nJohn I. Cox, U. S. Senator Luke Lea, Misses Laura Clay of Kentucky and\r\nMary Johnston of Virginia. Mrs. Virginia Clay Clopton, as president,\r\nsent greetings from the Huntsville, Ala., league, reorganized after a\r\nlapse of thirty years with the same president. The main discussion was\r\nwhether to introduce a suffrage bill in the Legislature. Mrs. Margaret\r\nErvin Ford urged it, saying that, though it had small chance, it was\r\nwell to accustom the Legislature to the idea. The matter was placed in\r\nthe hands of Miss Elliott, Mrs. French, Mrs. Dudley and Mrs. Scott,\r\nwho recommended that no bill should be introduced. Mrs. Allen and Miss\r\nElliott were re-elected and Mrs. James M. McCormack was made\r\nvice-president-at-large; Miss Clay and Miss Johnston spoke on the 10th\r\nat a large meeting in Chattanooga and Miss Clay the following Sunday\r\nin the Universalist church. On April 7 Miss Elliott and Mrs. Dudley\r\nmarched in Washington in a parade to the Capitol to interview the\r\nTennessee representatives in Congress on the Federal Amendment. This\r\nyear Miss Jeannette Rankin of Montana, an organizer for the National\r\nAssociation, came to assist. By October the State membership was 942\r\nand fifteen newspapers were reached regularly with suffrage matter.\r\nBooths were conducted at many of the county fairs and a \"suffrage day\"\r\nwas given at the Memphis Tri-State fair, when the outside speakers\r\nwere Miss Clay and Miss Kate Gordon of Louisiana. The _News Scimitar_\r\nissued a suffrage edition.\r\n\r\nA second convention met in Morristown, October 21, 22. Miss Sue S.\r\nWhite was elected secretary, Mrs. Hardy State organizer and the other\r\nofficers continued. At the national convention in Washington in\r\nNovember Miss Wester and Mrs. Ford represented Tennessee on the\r\n\"committee of one hundred,\" which, led by Mrs. Medill McCormick,\r\nchairman of the National Congressional Committee, called upon\r\nPresident Wilson to enlist his assistance. That year and each\r\nsucceeding year letters, telegrams and petitions were sent to the\r\nPresident and to the Tennessee Representatives in Congress urging\r\ntheir support of the Federal Amendment. One petition from Chattanooga\r\nbore a thousand signatures.\r\n\r\nBy 1914 the six largest cities in the State were organized and the\r\nmajority of the clubs celebrated National Suffrage Day, May 2, with\r\nparades and open air meetings to the amazement and interest of the\r\npeople. The Chattanooga parade, with a brass band, ended at the Court\r\nHouse where the steps of that building were aglow with yellow bunting.\r\nMrs. Wesley Martin Stoner of Washington, D. C., was the principal\r\nspeaker and Mrs. Ford, the local president, read the following\r\nresolution: \"We, citizens of Chattanooga, voice our demand that women\r\ncitizens of the United States be accorded the full right of\r\ncitizenship.\" The silence was breathless as the sound of the \"ayes\"\r\ndied away and not a voice was raised to say \"no.\" Other speakers were\r\nMayor Jesse M. Littleton, L. P. Barnes, Attorney J. J. Lynch, the\r\nReverends Charles H. Myers, L. R. Robinson and Dr. Daniel E. Bushnell.\r\nThe State Federation of Women's Clubs in convention at Pulaski voted\r\ndown a suffrage resolution, though the president, Mrs. George W.\r\nDenney, favored it.\r\n\r\nFrom March to May 13 there was a spirited controversy as to whether\r\nthe annual convention of the National American Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation should meet in Chattanooga, which city had invited it, or\r\nin Nashville, which had not. Miss Elliott, who was ill, resigned and\r\nMrs. McCormack took charge of the State work. Chattanooga won the\r\nconvention on the first vote of the State board but after balloting\r\nby the clubs through telegrams for several weeks and much\r\nmisunderstanding it met in Nashville the next November. The annual\r\nconvention was held in Knoxville October 28-30, when there was a\r\nseparation of the State forces, Mrs. Crozier French and her following\r\nleaving the convention, taking three clubs with them and organizing\r\nthe \"Tennessee Equal Suffrage Association Incorporated,\" with Mrs.\r\nFrench president. Mrs. McCormack was elected president of the original\r\nEqual Suffrage Association, of which this chapter is the history.\r\n\r\nThe Southern States Suffrage Conference, Miss Kate M. Gordon,\r\npresident, met in Chattanooga, November 10-11, just before the\r\nnational convention. A special suffrage edition of the _News_, with\r\nMrs. Frances Fort Brown editor-in-chief, was issued and the conference\r\nwas a great success. Many prominent women from outside the State\r\nattended and all except Mrs. Oliver H. P. Belmont of New York and Miss\r\nChristabel Pankhurst of England, who was with her, went on to the\r\nnational convention at Nashville. Here a special edition of the\r\n_Tennesseean_ was issued, many street meetings were held and suffrage\r\narguments filled the air. Both State delegations were seated.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the year only four cities with a population of five\r\nthousand or over were still unorganized. In December Miss Mary\r\nPleasant Jones organized the Nashville Business Women's League with a\r\nlarge membership. Organization was continued during 1915. Through the\r\ncourtesy of Judge Samuel C. Brown, the Circuit Court at Benton was\r\nsuspended for an hour to hear the speeches of Miss Wester, Miss Sarah\r\nRuth Frazier and Mrs. Ford and a club was then organized with 100\r\nmembers. Mrs. Ford organized the Business Woman's Suffrage Club of\r\nChattanooga with 160 charter members. A Men's Suffrage Club was formed\r\nthere, the first in the State, R. B. Cook, George Fort Milton and J.\r\nB. F. Lowery, officers.\r\n\r\nThis year the suffragists assisted a vigorous campaign to secure a\r\nmajority vote for holding a convention to prepare a new constitution,\r\nopened headquarters in the different cities and worked day and night,\r\nand they received letters of high appreciation from the chairman of\r\nthe State committee. The convention really won but was lost by\r\ndishonest election returns. The annual convention was held at the\r\nHotel Patton, Chattanooga, December 9, Mrs. McCormack presiding. In\r\n1912 a treasury fund of $5.50 was turned over to the new treasurer,\r\nMiss Wester, who handled in 1915 $1,127. The National Association this\r\nyear elected Mrs. McCormack auditor.\r\n\r\nNational Suffrage Day, May 2, 1916, was celebrated in all of the\r\nlarger cities. The Business Women's Club brought Mrs. Emmeline\r\nPankhurst of England and Miss Margaret Foley of Boston to Chattanooga\r\nand the 5,000 capacity auditorium was packed. The State Federation of\r\nWomen's Clubs, which was to hold its convention there May 3, was\r\ninvited to attend and the next day it passed a woman suffrage\r\nresolution by a vote of 96 to 43.\r\n\r\nIn May woman suffrage planks were secured in both the Republican and\r\nDemocratic State platforms, after which the State officers living in\r\nChattanooga had a 25-foot streamer prepared with the following words\r\non it: Tennessee Leads the South, The State Federation, Republican and\r\nDemocratic Parties Endorse Woman Suffrage, and had it stretched across\r\nthe main street. Over night Police Commissioner E. R. Betterton had\r\nmade a ruling that banners could no longer hang over the street and\r\nthree policemen with the patrol wagon \"arrested\" it. The women secured\r\nthe release of the culprit and through the courtesy of E. A. Abbott, a\r\nmerchant, it was placed over the front of his store and there it hung\r\nfor several weeks. On June 13 it was taken to the National Democratic\r\nconvention at St. Louis, where it gave its silent message hanging on\r\nthe wall of the lobby of the hotel in which the Tennessee delegation\r\nhad headquarters. Mrs. Dudley and Mrs. Ford addressed the Tennessee\r\ndelegates to the convention urging them to vote for the woman suffrage\r\nplank, which they did unanimously.\r\n\r\nMrs. Catt held a successful congressional conference in Memphis, spoke\r\nat several large meetings and the biggest automobile parade ever seen\r\nin the city added to the occasion.[170] Federal Amendment Day was\r\ncelebrated in twenty-six cities and thousands of leaflets were\r\ndistributed. In October the legislative chairman wrote to all\r\ncandidates for Congress asking their position on suffrage and eight\r\ndeclared in favor. In November those elected were interviewed and\r\nbanquets, luncheons and receptions given them on the eve of their\r\nleaving for Washington.\r\n\r\nIn order to unite the two State associations Mrs. Catt suggested that\r\nthey hold their conventions at about the same time in the same city.\r\nThe Tennessee Equal Suffrage Association, Mrs. McCormack president,\r\nset its convention for Jan. 5, 6, 1917, and that of the other was\r\nannounced for the 9th, both in Nashville. The former was held at the\r\nHotel Hermitage, large and enthusiastic, with the principal speakers\r\nClyde Shropshire, Speaker of the House, the Hon. George L. Berry,\r\nDixon Merritt, editor of the _Tennesseean_, and Miss Laura Clay. Mrs.\r\nFord was elected president. The latter postponed its convention to\r\nJanuary 30-31, which made the union impossible. On February 22 the\r\nformer association offered its services to Governor Rye to be utilized\r\nas he should see fit, should the United States enter the war. Mrs.\r\nCatt called a meeting of the Executive Council of the National\r\nAssociation for the 23rd in Washington to consider offering its\r\nassistance to President Wilson and Mrs. Ford represented Tennessee.\r\nThe suffragists of this State, as did those of every other, rallied to\r\nthe colors. Many served in France and thousands at home in every field\r\nof activity where women were permitted, in army and navy, in citizen\r\nservice, Red Cross, Government bond sales, etc., and their devoted\r\nservice proved a most effective plea for their enfranchisement.\r\n\r\nOn March 26, 1918, the boards of the two associations met in Memphis\r\nat the Professional and Business Women's Club, with Mrs. Allen,\r\nhonorary president, in the chair. A union was effected and Mrs. Leslie\r\nWarner was unanimously elected president of the amalgamated\r\nassociations. Mrs. Warner spoke at the State Federation of Women's\r\nClubs in Jackson and after one session she asked all to remain who\r\nwere interested in suffrage. About 90 per cent. did so and an\r\nenthusiastic meeting was held. Her next work was to secure resolutions\r\nin favor of the Federal Suffrage Amendment and protests against\r\nfurther delay in the Senate. She spoke before nineteen organizations\r\nof various kinds, all of which passed the desired resolutions. It was\r\nalso endorsed by the Democratic and Republican State Committees.\r\n\r\nAs vice-chairman of the Woman's Committee Council of National Defense,\r\nMrs. Warner introduced Dr. Shaw, its chairman, to an audience of 7,000\r\npeople at Nashville in April. In July she called 200 suffragists from\r\nall sections of the State for a hearing before U. S. Senator John K.\r\nShields, hoping they might convince him that the Tennessee women did\r\nwant the ballot, as one of his reasons for voting against the Federal\r\nAmendment was that they did not. Later when pressed by the women for a\r\ndeclaration during his candidacy for re-election he gave to the press\r\nhis correspondence with President Wilson who had urged him to vote for\r\nit, to whom he wrote: \"If I could bring myself to believe that the\r\nadoption of the resolution would contribute to the successful\r\nprosecution of the war we are waging with Germany I would\r\nunhesitatingly vote for it, because my whole heart and soul are\r\ninvolved in bringing the war to a victorious issue and I am willing to\r\nsacrifice everything save the honor and freedom of our country in\r\naiding you to accomplish that end, but I have been unable to do\r\nso....\"\r\n\r\nThe President said in reply: \"I realize the weight of argument that\r\nhas controlled your attitude in the matter and I would not have\r\nwritten as I did if I had not thought that the passage of the\r\namendment at this time was an essential psychological element in the\r\nconduct of the war for democracy. I am led by a single sentence in\r\nyour letter, therefore, to say that I do earnestly believe that our\r\naction upon this amendment will have an important and immediate\r\ninfluence upon the whole atmosphere and morale of the nations engaged\r\nin the war and every day I am coming to see how supremely important\r\nthat side of the whole thing is.\"\r\n\r\nOn August 8 the State Bar Association passed a strong resolution\r\nendorsing woman suffrage by Federal Amendment. The president, Colonel\r\nEd Watkins, in his annual address, included a strong plea for it and\r\nJudge David V. Puryear introduced the resolution. Miss Elizabeth Lea\r\nMiller and Mrs. Ford, the first women members of the association; Mrs.\r\nJohn Lamar Meek and others worked for it. Col. Joseph H. Acklen gave\r\nhis services as attorney for years to the State association without\r\ncharge. Urgent petitions which bore the names of all the leading\r\nDemocrats of the State, arranged on a large sheet with the photograph\r\nof and a quotation from President Woodrow Wilson, were sent to Senator\r\nShields. The State board sent petitions to the legislators urging that\r\nthey ask him to vote for the Federal Amendment resolution, which\r\nlacked only two votes of passing the Senate, but he opposed it to the\r\nend.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of Mrs. Warner's régime was filled with efforts in the\r\nLegislature for the Presidential suffrage bill. She began in September\r\nand worked unceasingly until its passage the next April, financing the\r\ncampaign with some small assistance from her board. During the\r\nhundredth anniversary of the city of Memphis in June, a notable State\r\nevent, a suffrage \"victory\" celebration was held with addresses by\r\nMayor Monteverde and leading suffragists.\r\n\r\nThe eleventh annual convention was held in the Tulane Hotel,\r\nNashville, June 4, 5, 1919. During the second day's session news came\r\nof the submission of the Federal Amendment by the U. S. Senate and\r\nexcitement ran riot. Telegrams of congratulation were sent to Mrs.\r\nCatt, Dr. Shaw, U. S. Senator McKellar and the Tennessee\r\nRepresentatives who voted for it. It was a dramatic ending of the\r\nlong contest--long even in Tennessee, for here too women had grown old\r\nand died in the struggle. Tributes were paid to those who were gone,\r\namong them Mrs. Meriwether who had given her life to the work. The two\r\npioneers present, Mrs. Allen and Miss Terrett, gave reminiscences of\r\nthe early days. Mrs. George Fort Milton was elected president.\r\n\r\nA call was issued for the final convention of the State association\r\nand the first convention of the Tennessee League of Women Voters to\r\nmeet May 18, 19, 1920, in the House of Representatives at Nashville.\r\nThis was signed by the presidents of the following State associations:\r\nSuffrage, Mothers' Congress and Parent Teachers', Woman's Christian\r\nTemperance Union, Federation of Music Clubs, Daughters of the American\r\nRevolution and Press and Authors' Club. Mrs. Milton presided over the\r\nconvention and Miss Mary Boyce Temple, regent of the D. A. R.,\r\npresided over the first conference of the League of Women Voters. The\r\nassociation and the League were merged and Mrs. Milton was elected\r\nchairman.[171]\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. 1911. This year for the first time a resolution\r\nwas introduced by Senator Walter White of Dayton \"to amend the\r\nconstitution so as to give women the ballot.\" It was referred to the\r\nConstitutional Amendment Committee, Alfred A. Adams, chairman, which\r\nreported adversely. The women in charge were Mrs. J. D. Allen, State\r\npresident, and Attorney Frances Wolf, legislative chairman.\r\n\r\n1915. The suffragists espoused two bills. The association of which\r\nMrs. McCormack was president worked for a new State constitution\r\nbecause of the great difficulty of changing the old one. The\r\nassociation of which Mrs. Dudley was president asked for an amendment.\r\nIt received a \"courtesy\" vote in favor from the first Legislature and\r\ndid not come before a second. Mrs. McCormack, Mrs. Ford, Mrs. Henry J.\r\nKelso, Mrs. Hall and Miss Wester were the Legislative Committee.\r\n\r\n1917. In March the Legislature passed an Act amending the charter of\r\nLookout Mountain so as to give the women Municipal suffrage. The prime\r\nmover was Attorney James Anderson and Mayor P. F. Jones, and the other\r\ncommissioners voted unanimously for it. Mrs. Ford, the State\r\npresident, a lifelong resident, had the previous year registered there\r\nin order to call attention to the injustice of \"taxation without\r\nrepresentation\" but her name was removed from the records. Early in\r\n1917 Mrs. Ford called on President Wilson at the White House and asked\r\nhim to send a message to the Legislature in favor of the pending\r\nPresidential suffrage bill, which he did.\r\n\r\n[Mrs. Ford's thorough account of the fortunes of this bill through the\r\nLegislatures of 1917 and 1919 is so largely covered by the report in\r\nPart I of this chapter that it is omitted here.][172]\r\n\r\nAfter the law was enacted Mrs. Kenny and Mrs. Kimbrough appeared at\r\nthe office of the county trustee and made a tender of the amount due\r\nas their poll tax. He refused to receive it, acting under instructions\r\nfrom the county attorney who declared that the laws of the State\r\nexempted women. They then filed a bill in the Chancery Court of\r\nDavidson county asking a decision. Chancellor Newman dismissed it with\r\nan opinion in part as follows: \"It will be observed by Section 686 of\r\nthe code that those liable for poll taxes are males between the ages\r\nof 21 and 50 years on the 10th day of January the year the assessment\r\nis laid. Women were not liable Jan. 10, 1919, for poll tax and plainly\r\nit was never the purpose or intent of Section 1220 that a qualified\r\nvoter as a condition precedent to the right to vote should produce\r\nsatisfactory evidence that he had paid a poll tax assessed against him\r\nfor which he was not liable.... All women between the ages of 21 and\r\n50 years, otherwise qualified as voters, are entitled to vote in the\r\nNovember election of 1920 without paying a poll tax for 1919.\" The\r\ncase was taken to the Supreme Court, which ruled that women did not\r\nhave to pay in order to vote that year.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. When the Legislature of Washington in March, 1920,\r\nratified the Federal Woman Suffrage Amendment making the 35th, there\r\ncame an absolute stop. The southeastern States had rejected it and it\r\nhad been ratified by all the others except Vermont and Connecticut,\r\nwhose Governors refused to call special sessions. It looked as if the\r\nwomen of the United States would be prevented from voting at the\r\npresidential election in November for the lack of one ratification.\r\nThere was every reason to believe that the Legislature of Tennessee\r\nwould give this one if it were not prevented by a clause in the State\r\nconstitution. Meanwhile the ratification of the Federal Prohibition\r\nAmendment by the Ohio Legislature had been sent to the voters by a\r\nrecent law, they had rejected it and an appeal had been taken to the\r\nU. S. Supreme Court on the constitutionality of the referendum law. On\r\nJune 1, in Hawk vs. Smith, this court held that a referendum to the\r\nvoters on the ratification of Federal Amendments was in conflict with\r\nArticle V of the Federal Constitution, therefore null and void, as\r\nthis Constitution was the supreme law of the land. The decision said:\r\n\"It is not the function of courts or legislative bodies, National or\r\nState, to alter the method which the U. S. Constitution has fixed.\"\r\n\r\nArticle II, Section 32 of the Tennessee constitution reads: \"No\r\nconvention or General Assembly of this State shall act upon any\r\namendment of the Constitution of the United States proposed by\r\nCongress to the several States unless such convention or General\r\nAssembly shall have been elected after such amendment is submitted.\"\r\nThe presumption was naturally that this clause was nullified by the U.\r\nS. Supreme Court's decision. On June 10, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,\r\npresident of the National American Suffrage Association, telegraphed\r\nGovernor Albert H. Roberts, urging him to call an extra session. He,\r\nthereupon, sought the opinion of Attorney General Frank M. Thompson as\r\nto the power of the present Legislature to ratify, who answered that\r\nit would have the power. He said that he had submitted the question to\r\nthe U. S. Department of Justice through Solicitor General John L.\r\nFrierson, to whom President Wilson had also appealed, whose answer in\r\nbrief was as follows: \"The ruling of the Supreme Court in the Ohio\r\ncase and the consideration which I gave to this question in preparing\r\nthose cases for hearing leave no doubt in my mind that the power to\r\nratify an amendment to the Federal Constitution is derived solely\r\nfrom the people of the United States through this constitution and not\r\nfrom the people or the constitution of the State. The provision of the\r\nTennessee constitution that no Legislature shall act on an amendment\r\nto the Federal Constitution unless elected after the proposal of the\r\namendment, if valid, would undoubtedly be a restriction upon that\r\npower.... If the Legislature is called in extra session it will have\r\nthe clear right to ratify.\"\r\n\r\nA request was made to President Wilson for assistance, and on June 24\r\nhe sent the following telegram to Governor Roberts: \"It would be a\r\nreal service to the party and to the nation if it is possible for you\r\nunder the peculiar provisions of your State constitution, having in\r\nmind the recent decision of the Supreme Court in the Ohio case, to\r\ncall a special session of the Legislature to consider the Federal\r\nSuffrage Amendment. Allow me to urge this very earnestly.\" At the same\r\ntime the Governor received a telegram signed by practically every\r\nmember of the Tennessee delegation at the National Democratic\r\nconvention meeting in San Francisco, impressing on him the advantage\r\nto the party of his calling the extra session. In addition U. S.\r\nSenator Kenneth McKellar, a member of the platform committee of that\r\nconvention, secured a plank in the platform, endorsing the amendment\r\nand urging the Democratic Governors and legislators of Tennessee and\r\nother States to unite in an effort to complete the ratification. On\r\nJune 26 Homer S. Cummings, chairman of the Democratic National\r\nCommittee, informed the Governor that the committee that day by\r\nunanimous vote had directed him to send the following message: \"We\r\nmost earnestly emphasize the extreme importance and urgency of an\r\nimmediate meeting of your Legislature for the purpose of ratifying the\r\nproposed 19th Amendment to the Federal Constitution.\" On June 8 the\r\nTennessee Democratic convention had passed the following resolution:\r\n\"We heartily favor the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the\r\nConstitution of the United States ... and we demand that the Governor\r\ncall an extra session.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Roberts answered President Wilson: \"I will call the extra\r\nsession in ample time for the women to vote in the 1920 elections.\"\r\nThis he did on August 7, calling the Legislature to convene on the\r\n9th.[173]\r\n\r\nThe first of July Governor Roberts appointed Mrs. Leslie Warner State\r\nchairman to organize for ratification. She selected a committee of one\r\nhundred, some from each county, recommended by the legislators, and\r\nopened headquarters at the Hotel Hermitage in Nashville and Mrs. James\r\nB. Ezzell was elected vice-chairman, Mrs. Margaret Ervin Ford,\r\nsecretary of the committee, which became known as the Democratic\r\nRatification Committee. On the advisory board were: Miss Charl\r\nWilliams, vice-chairman of the National Democratic Committee; Miss\r\nDella Dortch, regional chairman of the National League of Women\r\nVoters; Mesdames A. H. Roberts, wife of the Governor; Guilford Dudley,\r\nthird vice-president of the National Suffrage Association; John B.\r\nGilmore, James S. Fraser and Miss Lutie Jones. Mrs. George Fort\r\nMilton, chairman of the League of Women Voters, appointed Mrs. John M.\r\nKenny State chairman for ratification with Mesdames John R. Aust and\r\nClaude B. Sullivan chairmen of committees. They opened headquarters at\r\nthe Maxwell House. Mrs. James Beasley became chairman of the\r\nRepublican committee and ex-Governor Rye of the Men's Committee,\r\nassisted by ex-Governors Albert A. Taylor and Ben W. Hooper and Mr.\r\nHal H. Clements.\r\n\r\nEarly in July Miss Marjorie Shuler, chairman of publicity of the\r\nNational Suffrage Association, was sent by it to assist. She expressed\r\ngratification at what had been accomplished, saying: \"The Tennessee\r\nwomen have done wonders; they are now well organized and things look\r\npromising for ratification.\" She joined with the committees in urging\r\nMrs. Catt to come and direct the work and she came soon after the\r\nmiddle of July and remained six weeks.[174] Her first move was to\r\nstart a series of letters through the League of Women Voters to local\r\ngroups urging meetings, deputations to legislators and the return to\r\nheadquarters of their signed pledges to vote for ratification, which\r\nlater were very useful. With Mrs. Milton and with Miss Shuler in\r\ncharge of publicity, a speaking tour began at Memphis and ended in\r\neastern Tennessee, including all the large cities and creating much\r\nfavorable sentiment. During this trip Mrs. Catt did not hesitate to\r\ncall attention to the sinister forces which it was discovered were\r\nworking against ratification and she sent a message to Senator Harding\r\nand Governor Cox, the presidential candidates, describing them. On\r\nJuly 24 Miss Esther Ogden, a director of the National Association,\r\nwith a deputation of women, appeared before the National Democratic\r\nCommittee in session at Columbus, O., presenting a memorial from that\r\nassociation, signed by Mrs. Catt, urging the committee to assume the\r\nresponsibility of achieving the ratification and she brought their\r\nfavorable answer to Nashville. The last week in July Mrs. Catt\r\nreceived the following from Senator Harding: \"I am exceedingly glad to\r\nlearn that you are in Tennessee seeking to consummate the ratification\r\nof the suffrage amendment. If any of the Republican members should ask\r\nmy opinion as to their course I would cordially recommend immediate\r\nfavorable action.\" He sent a similar message to Senator John C. Houk,\r\nState chairman, but later when the Harding-Coolidge League of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia urged him to appeal further for ratification he\r\nanswered: \"You can understand why I cannot consistently urge Tennessee\r\nlegislators to vote for ratification without knowing their reasons for\r\nsuch commitment as they have made. The situation is being reported to\r\nnational headquarters, where it will be given attention at once.\"\r\n\r\nA letter from Governor Cox to Mrs. Catt said: \"I am very much\r\ngratified at the news that you are to remain in Tennessee for the\r\nratification campaign. It gives me added reason for expressing\r\nconfidence that the Legislature will act favorably, which will greatly\r\nplease the national Democratic party.\" In addition he sent Miss Charl\r\nWilliams, a member of the Democratic National Committee, to Nashville\r\nwith the message that if necessary he would himself come and fight for\r\nit. On August 7 at the request of Will H. Hays, chairman of the\r\nRepublican National Committee, Mrs. Harriet Taylor Upton,\r\nvice-chairman of its executive committee, came to assist.\r\n\r\nUrged by President Wilson, Governor Cox, George White, chairman of the\r\nNational Democratic Committee, and Senator Pat Harrison, its chairman\r\nof publicity and speakers, U. S. Senator McKellar came with his\r\nvaluable help. Miss Edna A. Beveridge of Maryland and Mrs. Lydia\r\nHolmes, president of the Louisiana Suffrage Association, came to\r\nassist Mrs. Catt. Miss Sue White, Tennessee chairman of the National\r\nWoman's Party, assisted by Mesdames L. Crozier French, Walter Jackson,\r\nFrank Phillips, Miss Anita Pollitzer, Miss Betty Grim, Parley P.\r\nChristensen and others, also opened headquarters and worked for\r\nratification. Since there were so many committees at work it was\r\ndecided to appoint a general chairman and Miss Charl Williams was the\r\nwise choice.\r\n\r\nFrom the time the special session was called anti-suffragists gathered\r\nin Nashville from Maine to the Gulf of Mexico, many of them paid\r\nworkers. Everett P. Wheeler, a New York lawyer, president of a\r\nso-called American Constitutional League, formerly the Men's\r\nAnti-Suffrage Association, came and formed a branch composed of men\r\nprominent politically, who used every means known to influence\r\nlegislation; sent speakers into the districts of friendly legislators,\r\npromised rewards, used threats, and charges of bribery were so\r\ninsistent that Judge D. B. DeBow ordered a grand jury investigation.\r\nThere was no depth to which some of the men trying to defeat woman\r\nsuffrage did not descend.[175]\r\n\r\nMrs. James S. Pinckard of Alabama, president of the Southern Women's\r\nRejection League; Miss Josephine Pearson, its Tennessee president;\r\nMiss Mary G. Kilbreth, president of the National Anti-Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation, with many of their followers were at work with the\r\nlegislators. They were industriously assisted by Mrs. Ruffin G.\r\nPleasant, wife of the ex-Governor of Louisiana, and by Miss Kate M.\r\nGordon of that State and Miss Laura Clay of Kentucky, ardent\r\nsuffragists but opposed to the Federal Amendment. The presidents or\r\nother officers of anti-suffrage associations in Ohio, Maryland,\r\nDelaware, Massachusetts, Maine and other States joined with the forces\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature convened in extraordinary session Aug. 9, 1920, and\r\nheard the Governor's message, which said in part: \"The Legislatures of\r\nthirty-five States have ratified the amendment, only one more being\r\nrequired to make it effective as a part of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States. Its prompt ratification is urgently recommended.\r\nTennessee occupies a pivotal position and the eyes of all America are\r\nupon us. Millions of women are looking to this Legislature to give\r\nthem a voice and share in shaping the destiny of the Republic.\" He\r\nthen quoted the platform declarations of both State and National\r\nDemocratic and Republican parties urging ratification. The next day\r\nthe Senate was called to order by President Andrew L. Todd, who\r\nintroduced the ratification resolution. It was introduced in the House\r\nby the Shelby county delegation, all for it. Both were referred to the\r\nCommittee on Constitutional Amendments.\r\n\r\nOn the night of August 12 a joint hearing was held and able speeches\r\nwere made by Senator McKellar, Generals James A. Fowler and Charles A.\r\nCates, Jr., and Attorney Ed T. Seay. Anti speakers were: Congressman\r\nFinis J. Garrett, Major E. B. Stahlman, Judges S. F. Wilson and G. N.\r\nTillman. Miss Charlotte Rowe, of Yonkers, N. Y., represented the\r\nNational Anti-Suffrage Association. The next day a memorial from\r\nMaryland \"antis\" urging rejection was read in the Senate. Senator L.\r\nE. Gwin presented the committee report recommending ratification,\r\nsigned by himself and Senators M. H. Copenhaver, John C. Houk, C. C.\r\nCollins, J. W. Murray, T. L. Coleman, Douglas Wikle and E. N. Haston.\r\nSenators W. M. Cameron and J. W. Rice presented the minority report.\r\nAfter many eloquent speeches in favor and two in opposition the\r\nSenate vote was ayes 25, noes 4, two not voting, and a motion to\r\nreconsider was tabled.\r\n\r\nOn August 17 the House Committee reported in favor of ratification,\r\nsaying: \"This is the performance of solemn platform promises and we\r\ntake great pride in the fact that to Tennessee has been accorded the\r\nsignal distinction of passing a resolution which will secure the final\r\nadoption of the 19th Amendment.\" Speaker Seth M. Walker then moved to\r\nadjourn to gain time, which was carried by 52 ayes, 44 noes. He had\r\ngiven the suffragists his word that he would not only vote for\r\nratification but would lead the fight for it in the House. On the\r\ncontrary he suddenly underwent a radical change and fought it bitterly\r\nthrough the entire session.\r\n\r\nOn August 18 occurred the most exciting and dramatic session ever held\r\nin the House. Speaker Walker moved to table the resolution in an\r\neffort to kill it. R. L. Dowlen, who had undergone a serious\r\noperation, was brought from his bed to the Capitol to vote for it. T.\r\nA. Dodson received a message that his baby was dying and after he had\r\ntaken the train it was found that his vote would be needed to carry\r\nit. A member reached the train as it was pulling out, found him and\r\nthey leaped off. He cast his vote for the resolution and a man who was\r\nable to do so sent him home on a special train. The Speaker lobbied\r\nopenly after clearing the House of suffrage lobbyists. Sitting with\r\nhis arm around the shoulder of Banks S. Turner he stopped his voting\r\nwhen his name was called, but Turner won the honor of all present\r\nwhen, at the end of the roll call, he threw off Speaker Walker's arm,\r\nstood up and cast his vote for ratification. Harry T. Burn, aged 24,\r\nhad been voting with the opposition but had given the suffragists his\r\nword that, as he had voted for the Presidential suffrage bill in 1919\r\nand as his mother wanted him to vote for ratification, he would do so\r\nif his vote should be needed but otherwise he would vote against it,\r\nas his constituency was opposed. When the vote was a tie--48 to 48--he\r\ninstantly realized that the resolution would be lost unless he should\r\nvote for it. This he did and the vote stood 49 ayes, 47 noes. Speaker\r\nWalker then changed his vote from no to aye, making the vote 50 ayes,\r\n46 noes, and moved to reconsider.[176]\r\n\r\nBy the rules of the House Speaker Walker had for three days the\r\nexclusive right in which to call up the motion to reconsider, after\r\nwhich others could do so. During this time the opponents worked madly\r\nto get one of the loyal 49 to change his vote without avail. They\r\nattempted every unscrupulous scheme known to control legislation. All\r\nfailing, as a last desperate move, 36 in the early morning hours made\r\na hegira to Decatur, Ala., where they remained for about ten days.\r\n\r\nOn August 23 the seats of the \"antis\" were conspicuously vacant. As\r\nthe Speaker had not asked for a reconsideration, Mr. Riddick moved to\r\ncall from the Journal the motion to reconsider. Speaker Walker ruled\r\nthis out of order, giving among other reasons that Judge E. F.\r\nLangford of the Chancery Court had granted a temporary injunction\r\nrestraining the Governor, Secretary of State and Speakers from\r\ncertifying to Secretary of State Colby that the Legislature had\r\nratified. Mr. Riddick appealed from the decision of the chair and it\r\nwas not sustained. He then moved that the House reconsider its action\r\nin concurring in the Senate ratification, which was defeated by 49\r\nnoes, 9 present and not voting. He next moved that the Clerk of the\r\nHouse be instructed to transmit to the Senate the ratification\r\nresolution, which was carried by a viva voce vote. Governor Roberts,\r\nhimself formerly a Judge, could not be checked by the devices of the\r\nopposition but asked Attorney General Thompson to place the matter\r\nbefore Chief Justice D. L. Lansden of the State Supreme Court. He\r\nissued a writ of supersedeas and certiorari, which, taking the matter\r\nout of the jurisdiction of the Chancery Court, amounted to a\r\ndissolving of the injunction. The Governor then mailed the certificate\r\nof ratification to Secretary Colby at noon, August 24, which he\r\nreceived on the morning of August 26. This completed the necessary\r\nthirty-six ratifications and Secretary Colby immediately proclaimed\r\nthe Federal Suffrage Amendment a part of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nDuring the weeks of machinations by the opposition, Governor Roberts,\r\nState Superintendent of Education Albert H. Williams, the other\r\nofficers of the administration and the efficient Steering Committee,\r\nmade up of members of the Legislature, headed by President Todd and\r\nChief Clerk W. M. Carter of the Senate, were on complete guard night\r\nand day.\r\n\r\nAfter the American Constitutional League had failed in the courts of\r\nTennessee they planned to secure injunctions against election\r\nofficials to prevent women from voting and carried their fight to the\r\ncourts of the District of Columbia, losing in every one. They finally\r\nreached the Supreme Court of the United States, which eventually\r\ndecided that the 19th Amendment was legally and constitutionally\r\nratified. [This matter is referred to in Chapter XX of Volume V.]\r\nMeanwhile on September 20 Speaker Walker and other opponents went to\r\nWashington and requested Secretary Colby to withdraw and rescind the\r\nratification proclamation. Failing in this effort they went on to\r\nConnecticut to prevent ratification by the special session there,\r\nwhich had at last been called, and this mission also was a failure.\r\n\r\nTo Tennessee will forever belong the glory of placing the last seal on\r\nthe Federal Amendment by which the women of the United States were\r\nenfranchised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP I.\r\n\r\nThe Suffrage Map from 1869 to 1893.

Kenny,\r\nan officer of the State Equal Suffrage Association from 1914 until the\r\nratification of the Federal Suffrage Amendment in 1920.\r\n\r\n[165] Through the combined efforts of the joint chairmen of the\r\ncampaign Committee, Mrs. Kenny and Mrs. Milton, and the association of\r\nwhich Mrs. Dudley was President, a conference was called to formulate\r\na plan of amalgamation of the two State associations. This was finally\r\naccomplished in March, 1918, when Mrs. Leslie Warner of Nashville was\r\nunanimously chosen as the amalgamation president.\r\n\r\n[166] The other congressional district chairmen were Mrs. Ferd. E.\r\nPowell, Johnson City; Miss Sara Ruth Fraser, Chattanooga; Mrs. Sam\r\nYoung, Dixon Springs; Mrs. Walter Jackson, Murfreesboro; Mrs.\r\nKimbrough, Nashville; Mrs. Ben Childers, Pulaski; Miss Sue S.

Crabtree, President of the Senate: May I not express my\r\nearnest hope that the Senate of Tennessee will reconsider the vote by\r\nwhich it rejected the legislation extending the suffrage to women? Our\r\nparty is so distinctly pledged to its passage that it seems to me the\r\nmoral obligation is complete.--Woodrow Wilson.\"\r\n\r\n[168] Mrs. Frances Fort Brown of Nashville left a bequest of $3,000 to\r\nthe National American Woman Suffrage Association and its board of\r\nofficers appropriated enough of it to pay the expenses of this suit.\r\n\r\n[169] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Margaret Ervin\r\nFord, president of the State Equal Suffrage Association.\r\n\r\n[170] Mrs. C. B. Allen organized the Memphis Woman's Party within the\r\nState Association and became its president and Mrs. Ford organized it\r\nin Chattanooga with over 400 members, was elected president and ward\r\norganization started there. Nashville had the first through ward\r\norganization, due to Miss Matilda Porter.\r\n\r\n[171] The lists of the many officers of the association during the\r\nyears are unavoidably too imperfect to be used without doing injustice\r\nto those omitted. In Mrs. Ford's strong desire to give full credit to\r\nall the men and women who were actively connected with the work for\r\nwoman suffrage in Tennessee she sent lists so long that the lack of\r\nspace made it absolutely necessary to omit them.--Ed.\r\n\r\n[172] The gold pen used by Governor Roberts in signing the bill was\r\none used by Dr. John W. Wester when drafting the first anti-liquor\r\nbill ever introduced in the Tennessee Legislature, in December, 1841.\r\nWith it also Governor Rye signed the Lookout Mountain Suffrage Bill.\r\nIt belongs to Mrs. Ford, grand-daughter of Dr. Wester.\r\n\r\n[173] Anti-suffragists from all over the State bombarded Governor\r\nRoberts with threats of defeat for reelection should he persist in\r\npushing ratification, many of whom were his strongest friends and\r\nsupporters. At the special elections during the summer held to fill\r\nvacancies in the Legislature several suffragists were elected, among\r\nthem M. H. Copenhaver, who took the seat of Senator J. Parks Worley,\r\narch enemy of suffrage. T. K. Riddick, a prominent lawyer, made the\r\nrace in order to lead the fight for ratification in the House.\r\nRepresentative J. Frank Griffin made a flying trip from San Francisco\r\nto cast his vote for it.\r\n\r\n[174] Mrs. Catt, Mrs. Upton and Miss Shuler did no lobbying in the\r\nState House.\r\n\r\n[175] After Mrs. Catt returned to New York she said: \"Never in the\r\nhistory of politics has there been such a nefarious lobby as labored\r\nto block the ratification in Nashville. In the short time that I spent\r\nin the capital I was more maligned, more lied about, than in the\r\nthirty previous years I worked for suffrage. I was flooded with\r\nanonymous letters, vulgar, ignorant, insane. Strange men and groups of\r\nmen sprang up, men we had never met before in the battle. Who were\r\nthey? We were told, this is the railroad lobby, this is the steel\r\nlobby, these are the manufacturers' lobbyists, this is the remnant of\r\nthe old whiskey ring. Even tricksters from the U. S. Revenue Service\r\nwere there operating against us, until the President of the United\r\nStates called them off.... They appropriated our telegrams, tapped our\r\ntelephones, listened outside our windows and transoms. They attacked\r\nour private and public lives. I had heard of the 'invisible\r\ngovernment.' Well, I have seen it work and I have seen it sent into\r\noblivion.\"\r\n\r\n[176] Burn's vote so angered the opposition that they attempted to\r\nfasten a charge of bribery on him. On a point of personal privilege he\r\nmade a statement to the House which was spread upon the Journal. After\r\nindignantly denying the charge he said: \"I changed my vote in favor of\r\nratification because I believe in full suffrage as a right; I believe\r\nwe had a moral and legal right to ratify; I know that a mother's\r\nadvice is always safest for her boy to follow and my mother wanted me\r\nto vote for ratification. I appreciated the fact that an opportunity\r\nsuch as seldom comes to mortal man--to free 17,000,000 women from\r\npolitical slavery--was mine. I desired that my party in both State and\r\nNation might say it was a Republican from the mountains of East\r\nTennessee, purest Anglo-Saxon section in the world, who made woman\r\nsuffrage possible, not for any personal glory but for the glory of his\r\nparty.\"\r\n\r\n[Lack of space prevents giving the names of the immortal 49, which\r\nwere sent with the chapter.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nTEXAS.[177]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many reasons Texas was slow in entering the movement for woman\r\nsuffrage. There was some agitation of the subject from about 1885 and\r\nsome organization in 1893-6 but the work done was chiefly through the\r\nWoman's Christian Temperance Union. In February, 1903, a meeting was\r\ncalled at Houston by Miss Annette Finnigan, a Texas girl and a\r\ngraduate of Wellesley College. Here, with the help of her sisters,\r\nElizabeth and Katharine Finnigan Anderson, an Equal Suffrage League\r\nwas formed with Annette as president. The following month Mrs. Carrie\r\nChapman Catt, president of the National American Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation, lectured in Houston under its auspices. During the summer\r\nAnnette and Elizabeth Finnigan spoke several times in Galveston and\r\nsecured a suffrage committee of twenty-five there. With this nucleus a\r\nState Woman Suffrage Association was organized at a convention held in\r\nHouston, in December, which lasted two days and was well attended. Dr.\r\nAnna Howard Shaw, vice-president of the National Association, was\r\npresent at all the sessions, spoke at both evening meetings and took a\r\ndeep interest in the new organization. Annette Finnigan was elected\r\nState president and during the following year made an effort to\r\norganize in Beaumont, San Antonio and Austin but the women, although\r\ninterested, were too timid to organize for suffrage. Mrs. Charlotte\r\nPerkins Gilman spoke under the auspices of the league.\r\n\r\nThe second State convention or conference was held in Houston in\r\nDecember, 1904, Galveston and La Porte being represented. Reports were\r\ngiven and officers elected, Annette Finnigan remaining president. The\r\nHouston league had a paid up membership of one hundred, regular\r\nmeetings were held and the subject of woman suffrage was kept\r\nconstantly before the public. An effort was made to get a woman on the\r\nschool board but the Mayor refused to appoint one. Among those active\r\nin the work were Althea Jones, Miss Mary W. Roper, Mrs. E. F. and Miss\r\nRuby McGowen of Houston; Mrs. A. Adella Penfield of La Porte, Mrs. C.\r\nH. Moore and Miss Julia Runge of Galveston. The Finnigan sisters were\r\nthe leaders and the league prospered for several years until they left\r\nthe State. The movement became inactive and the society formed in\r\nAustin in 1908 with twenty-five members was the only one that\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 through the efforts of Miss M. Eleanor Brackenridge of San\r\nAntonio and Miss Anna Maxwell Jones, a Texas woman residing in New\r\nYork, suffrage clubs were organized in San Antonio, Galveston, Dallas,\r\nWaco, Tyler and San Marcos. Miss Finnigan returned to Texas and the\r\nHouston league was revived. The third State convention was held in San\r\nAntonio in March, 1913. Miss Brackenridge was elected president, Miss\r\nFinnigan honorary president. The convention was spirited and showed\r\nthat the suffrage movement was well launched. This was just ten years\r\nafter the first club was started. Miss Brackenridge possessed large\r\nmeans and a wide acquaintance and gave much prestige to the\r\nassociation. A number of notable speakers were brought to the State\r\nand the subject was introduced in women's organizations. This year\r\nthrough the San Antonio league a bill was introduced in the\r\nLegislature but never came to a vote.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1914, the State convention was held in Dallas and Miss\r\nBrackenridge was made honorary president and Miss Finnigan again\r\nelected president. During the year State headquarters were opened in\r\nHouston and the clubs were increased from eight to twenty-one. Miss\r\nPearl Penfield, as headquarters and field secretary, organized the\r\nState work. The president sent letters to all the legislators asking\r\nthem to pledge themselves to vote for a woman suffrage amendment to\r\nthe State constitution. None of them had an idea that any of the\r\nothers would agree to support it and a considerable number in a desire\r\nto \"please the ladies\" wrote charming letters of acquiescence. When in\r\nJanuary, 1915, they confronted a large group of women lobbyists,\r\nexperiences were hurriedly compared and consternation reigned among\r\nthem. \"Uncle\" Jesse Baker of Granbury, of honored memory, introduced\r\nthe resolution to submit an amendment to the electors. The Legislative\r\nCommittee were inexperienced but they worked with such zeal that it\r\nreceived a vote in the House of 90 to 32. It was not considered by the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nAmong those who worked with Miss Finnigan during the three months in\r\nAustin were Mrs. Minnie Fisher Cunningham, president of the Galveston\r\nEqual Suffrage Association; Mrs. Tex Armstrong of the Dallas\r\nassociation; Mrs. J. O. Creighton of the Austin association; Mrs. Ed.\r\nF. Harris and Mrs. J. H. W. Steele of Galveston; Mrs. David Doom, Mrs.\r\nRobert Connerly, Mrs. L. E. Walker, Mrs. A. B. Wolfe and Mrs. R. H.\r\nGriffith, all of Austin; Mrs William H. Dunne of San Antonio; Mrs.\r\nElizabeth Herndon Potter of Tyler; Mrs. W. E. Spell of Waco.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday afternoon, March 28, Dr. Shaw, the guest of Miss\r\nBrackenridge, delivered a great speech in Beethoven Hall under the\r\nauspices of the San Antonio Equal Franchise Society, accompanied on\r\nthe stage by its president, Mrs. Dan Leary; J. H. Kirkpatrick,\r\npresident of the Men's Suffrage League, the Rev. George H. Badger and\r\nMiss Marie B. Fenwick, a veteran suffragist. Many converts were made.\r\nIn April the State convention met in Galveston and reports showed\r\ntwenty-one auxiliaries. Mrs. Cunningham was elected president, alert,\r\nenthusiastic and bringing to the cause the valuable experience of work\r\nin it for the past two years. The president and new board prosecuted\r\nthe work so vigorously that during the year there was a 400 per cent.\r\nincrease in organizations. Miss Kate Hunter, president of the\r\nPalestine league, gave her entire summer vacation to field work.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1916, the State convention met in Dallas, re-elected Mrs.\r\nCunningham to the presidency and instructed the executive committee to\r\nask for suffrage planks in State and National Democratic platforms.\r\nThe name was changed from Woman Suffrage to Equal Suffrage Association\r\nand the Senatorial district plan of organization was adopted,\r\nfollowing the lines of the Democratic party. When the State Democratic\r\nconvention met in San Antonio this month to elect a national\r\ncommitteeman there were scores of women in the galleries proudly\r\nwearing their suffrage colors but Governor James E. Ferguson and\r\nex-U. S. Senator Joseph Weldon Bailey, both of unhallowed memory,\r\nunited their forces and woman suffrage had not a remote chance.\r\n\r\nTexas women went to the National Republican convention in Chicago in\r\nJune and a sufficient number of them to form half a block in the\r\n\"golden lane\" at the National Democratic convention in St. Louis. At\r\nthe latter Governor Ferguson brought in the minority report of the\r\nResolutions Committee against a woman suffrage plank in the platform,\r\nand let it be recorded that there were only three other men on the\r\ncommittee who would sign it, the remainder signing the majority report\r\nplacing the plank in the platform. In August the Democratic convention\r\nmet in Houston to nominate State candidates and prepare the State\r\nplatform. Mrs. Cunningham, Mrs. Helen Moore and Mrs. J. M. Quinnof\r\nappeared before the platform committee and with all the eloquence at\r\ntheir command urged it to insert a woman suffrage plank or at least to\r\nendorse the National platform. This committee was entirely in the\r\nhands of the liquor ring and Ferguson was czar of the convention, so\r\nwoman suffrage was ignored.\r\n\r\nMrs. Edith Hinkle League, the headquarters secretary, shared the\r\npresident's ten, twelve and even fourteen-hour days of labor, so that\r\nMrs. Cummingham was able to leave the office in charge of her and\r\nvolunteer assistants while she helped to fill the pressing need of\r\nfield workers and organizers. She had the assistance of Miss Lavinia\r\nEngle, one of the National Association's organizers. Despite the lack\r\nof funds when word came of West Virginia's need of Mrs. Cunningham in\r\nits amendment campaign the executive board paid her expenses to that\r\nState and she donated her services. Upon her return to Texas she\r\ndevoted July and August to field work, averaging two or three speeches\r\na day during these insufferably hot months.\r\n\r\nWhen the Legislature convened in January, 1917, the Legislative\r\nCommittee were on hand. The following report by Mrs. Cunningham\r\nsummarizes the work:\r\n\r\n     First. Opening suffrage headquarters on the main street at Austin\r\n     near the Capitol. Second. A luncheon, at which the attendance\r\n     exceeded the capacity of the largest hotel. The program was a\r\n     mock legislative session at which the suffrage bill came up for\r\n     the third reading and debate, those opposed imitating the style\r\n     of the leading \"antis\" at hearings. Third. A very successful mass\r\n     meeting at the Hancock Opera House with good speakers. Fourth.\r\n     Introduction of the House Joint Resolution for a suffrage\r\n     amendment, signed by twenty members, including some who had\r\n     opposed it in 1915. Fifth. Mass meeting in the House of\r\n     Representatives the night before the amendment came to a vote,\r\n     invitation for this being extended by resolution of the House.\r\n     Speaker F. O. Fuller presided and House and gallery were crowded.\r\n\r\n     Sixth. Introduction of the Primary suffrage bill in the Senate\r\n     and House. Seventh. Introduction of the Presidential suffrage\r\n     bill. Eighth. Speakers touring the State and keeping the cities\r\n     and towns aroused; a constant stream of letters to organizations\r\n     and individuals and from them to Representatives. Ninth. Press\r\n     work, a weekly news letter to those papers which would reach the\r\n     legislators; getting in touch with reporters and editors of the\r\n     large daily papers in the State in Austin for the session. First,\r\n     last and all the time work at the Capitol, interviewing members\r\n     of the House and Senate, Speaker, President, and public men who\r\n     could and if asked might help a little here and there. This work\r\n     was carried on daily for nearly three months.\r\n\r\n     It is my judgment that the Presidential suffrage bill could have\r\n     been passed (anticipating the Governor's veto though) but for the\r\n     fact that the closing days of the session were taken up by the\r\n     investigation of the Governor on charges preferred in the House.\r\n\r\nOn January 31 the Primary suffrage bill was favorably reported by the\r\nSenate committee but was not taken from the calendar. On February 6\r\nthe resolution to submit an amendment to the voters received 76 ayes,\r\n56 noes in the House, lacking the required two-thirds. It was not\r\nacted upon by the Senate. On February 19 the Presidential suffrage\r\nbill was referred to a Senate committee and on the 26th was returned\r\nwith a favorable minority report but not acted upon.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1917 the misdeeds of Governor Ferguson culminated and a great\r\ncampaign was begun to secure his impeachment. He was the implacable\r\nfoe of woman suffrage and of every great moral issue for which women\r\nstood, therefore at the very beginning of the campaign word was sent\r\nto the committee in Austin that the State Equal Suffrage Association\r\nhad abandoned all other work temporarily and placed its entire\r\nresources at their command. The offer was accepted at once and the\r\ncharacter and value of the services which the women performed may be\r\njudged from the following statement from D. K. Woodward, Jr.,\r\nsecretary of the Central Committee in charge of the campaign:\r\n\r\n     The impeachment of former Governor Ferguson could not have been\r\n     brought about without the cooperation of the women of the\r\n     State.... Their work was under the direction of Mrs. Cunningham,\r\n     president of the Texas Equal Suffrage Association, who came at\r\n     once to Austin and established headquarters. The women were asked\r\n     to reach the remote sections, to eradicate prejudice and leave\r\n     understanding in its stead.... They did all that was asked of\r\n     them and more. The most confirmed skeptic on the question of\r\n     women's participation in public life must have been converted had\r\n     he witnessed the unselfish, tireless, efficient work of these\r\n     hundreds of devoted women and the striking ability of their\r\n     leader, whose genius for organization, knowledge of public\r\n     affairs and public men of Texas and sound judgment on all\r\n     questions of policy were of untold value....[178]\r\n\r\nThen came the entrance of the United States into the World War and the\r\nsuffragists consecrated time, strength, life itself if necessary to\r\nits demands. The call to the annual convention held in Waco in May,\r\n1917, indicated with what directness and intelligence the women\r\napproached their added responsibilities. It was \"a call to the\r\ncolors,\" to work for the war. War and Woman's Service; What can we do?\r\nOur Need of the Ballot to do it; True Americanism, were among the\r\nsubjects considered. It voted to ask the War Department to abolish\r\nsaloons in the soldiers' concentration and mobilization camps.\r\nResolutions were passed pledging \"loyal and untiring support to the\r\nGovernment.\" The convention expressed itself in no uncertain tones in\r\nthe following resolution telegraphed to President Wilson: \"For nearly\r\nseventy years the women of the United States have tried the State\r\nrights' route with its long and tortuous path. Since the Texas\r\nLegislature has repeatedly refused submission of the suffrage\r\namendment to the voters, thereby repudiating the State rights'\r\nprinciple of the Democratic party, the State Equal Suffrage\r\nAssociation hereby urges your support of the Federal Suffrage\r\nAmendment to enfranchise the women of our country.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Cunningham was literally conscripted president again, with a\r\nbudget calling for the expenditure of $30,000 and only $66.38 in the\r\ntreasury! Other offices were filled and then the women hurried home to\r\nengage in Red Cross work, Liberty Loan work, anti-vice work; to knit,\r\nto sew, to tramp the highways and byways for the various \"drives\"; to\r\nmake speeches before all sorts of audiences--women who a year before\r\nwere too timid to second a motion. Following the instructions of the\r\nconvention Mrs. Cunningham in June called together in San Antonio the\r\nheads of all organizations of women and out of the conference was\r\nformed the Woman's Anti-Vice Committee. Living in such close proximity\r\nto the training camps, Texas women early learned with sinking hearts\r\nof the unspeakable conditions obtaining there and their efforts to\r\nremedy matters and to arouse the proper authorities were strenuous and\r\nunceasing. Thousands of mothers whose sons were in training in far\r\naway Texas will never know how earnestly the mothers of this State\r\nlabored to do by their sons as they would have wished their own done\r\nby.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Amendment work was not neglected during this time, neither\r\nwas State work and organizations rapidly multiplied. The year 1918 is\r\none never to be forgotten by Texas suffragists. January was given over\r\nto intensive work for the Federal Amendment. Day letters, night\r\nletters and telegrams poured into Congress at such a rate that the\r\nnational president, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, referred to them as the\r\n\"heavy artillery down in Texas.\" The Executive Committee of the State\r\nAssociation in session at Austin, on the 23rd authorized Mrs.\r\nCunningham and Mrs. Hortense Ward to call upon the new Governor,\r\nWilliam P. Hobby, and ask that he submit a bill for Primary suffrage\r\nfor women at the special session of the Legislature soon to convene.\r\n\r\nA few weeks later the special session was called to consider a number\r\nof important measures asked for by the Secretary of War. On February\r\n24 the suffrage leaders came to Austin and established headquarters at\r\nthe Driskill Hotel, determined to secure the Primary law in time for\r\nwomen to vote in the July elections. While the women were interviewing\r\nthe legislators Mrs. Nonie B. Mahoney, prominent in Dallas suffrage\r\nwork, called on Judge Barry of that city, who seemed unfavorable and\r\nfinally said it would take 5,000 names of Dallas women on a petition\r\nto change him. He dismissed the subject from his mind and returned to\r\nhis legislative duties. Four days later Mrs. Mahoney arrived in Austin\r\nwith a heavy suit case, opened it and unfolded before the Judge's\r\nastonished gaze a petition containing the names, not alone of the\r\nrequired 5,000 but of 10,000 of his townswomen!\r\n\r\nMrs. Cunningham and her committee again asked the Governor to submit\r\nPrimary suffrage for women to the Legislature but he delayed. So great\r\npressure was brought to bear on him that he finally consented if they\r\nshould present a petition to him signed by a majority of the members\r\nof both House and Senate. After many hours of labor they were able to\r\ncomply with this condition and to furnish additional data to prove\r\nthat the bill would pass both Houses with large majorities. The\r\nGovernor did not submit it but he did submit the Primary Election\r\nbill, and the Primary Suffrage bill was immediately introduced by C.\r\nB. Metcalfe of San Angelo as an amendment to it. It passed the House\r\nMarch 16 by a vote of 84 to 34 and the Senate March 21 by 17 to 4, and\r\nwas signed by Governor Hobby on March 26 in the presence of Mr.\r\nMetcalfe, Captain Sackett, who also labored untiringly in its behalf,\r\nMrs. Cunningham, Mrs. Doom, Mrs. Elizabeth Speer and Mrs. McCallum,\r\nmembers of the Legislative Committee. The handsome fountain pen was\r\npurchased for the occasion by Mr. Metcalfe and after the signing\r\npresented by him to Mrs. Cunningham. Judge A. S. Lattimore drafted the\r\nbill in 1917 and Judge Ocie Speer of Fort Worth the one carried in\r\n1918.[179]\r\n\r\nThis law gave women the right to vote at all primary elections and in\r\nall nominating conventions and nominations are equivalent to an\r\nelection, as there is practically but one party. As Texas has two U.\r\nS. Senators and 18 Representatives it gave the women votes for more\r\nmembers of Congress than those of any other State possessed, and\r\nconsequently for more presidential electors.[180]\r\n\r\nThe remaining days in March, all of April and a part of May were\r\ndevoted by the suffragists to the Liberty Loan. The annual convention\r\nwas held in Austin May 29-31. In order to concentrate the entire\r\nstrength of the organization on war work the delegates agreed not to\r\nask the Legislature of 1919 to submit a constitutional amendment for\r\nfull suffrage but the women would give whatever time they could spare\r\nto the Federal Amendment. The convention enthusiastically endorsed\r\nGovernor Hobby for re-election and he addressed the delegates. It was\r\nresolved to vote only for candidates for the Legislature who favored\r\nratification and to send greetings and letters of appreciation to the\r\n\"immortal six\" Texas Representatives in Congress who voted for the\r\namendment the preceding January.[181] Decisions of importance were to\r\nwork out a plan whereby women could be educated as to candidates and\r\nissues and the machinery of voting; to endeavor to bring out a heavy\r\nvote of women in the coming primaries and to organize non-partisan\r\nWomen Voters' Leagues. Mrs. Cunningham against her determined protest\r\nwas re-elected president.\r\n\r\nThe suffrage law did not go into effect until June 26, and, as the\r\nprimary election was scheduled for July 27 and registration had to\r\ncease fifteen days before, the women had only seventeen days in which\r\nto register. There was not time to assess and collect the poll tax\r\nrequisite for voting and the Legislature added to its good work by\r\nremitting it for the election in case of women. The suffrage\r\nassociation set to work to assist the new citizens. Omitting only the\r\nwords \"official ballot,\" nearly half a million reproductions of the\r\nlong, complicated ballot to be used in the July primaries were\r\ncirculated; candidates' records were scrutinized; issues were studied;\r\n\"schools of instruction\" were conducted all over the State. Women\r\nattending the first \"schools\" held others until practically the city\r\nwomen in every precinct, ward and block had been given the chance to\r\nvote intelligently if they so desired and the country women had\r\nsimilar opportunities. All the candidates for Governor who stood for\r\ncivic righteousness withdrew in favor of Governor Hobby when it became\r\ncertain that Ferguson would again be a candidate and the women\r\norganized Hobby clubs and advertised Ferguson's record. A strong\r\ncampaign was also waged in behalf of the suffrage candidate for\r\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction, Miss Annie Webb Blanton.\r\nCongressional candidates and those for the Legislature came in for\r\nespecial attention. Thousands of women remained in the heat and dust\r\nall summer to help in the campaign. As a result approximately 386,000\r\nwomen registered in the seventeen days--surely a convincing answer to\r\nthe statement that \"Southern women do not want to vote.\" Governor\r\nHobby was elected by an immense majority, as were Miss Blanton and all\r\nof the candidates who had been espoused by the new voters.\r\n\r\nIn August women were heartily welcomed into the political conventions,\r\nthe men urging their appointment on all committees and even passing\r\nresolutions of pleasure at having them participate! It was reported\r\nthat 233 out of 253 county conventions endorsed woman suffrage in some\r\nform. In September, 1918, at the State Democratic convention in Waco\r\nthe women carried their demand for an endorsement of the Federal\r\nSuffrage Amendment but not without strenuous opposition. In November\r\nthe Executive Board of the State Suffrage Association unanimously\r\npassed a resolution emphasizing the one of its annual convention, that\r\nthe Legislature be requested to postpone a State referendum on woman\r\nsuffrage until after the war. The thought of one under present\r\nconditions was appalling. A Ratification Committee which included the\r\nheads of practically all of the women's organizations of state-wide\r\nimportance was formed. Mrs. Cunningham went to Washington for the\r\nfourth time to assist the National Congressional Committee in the\r\neffort for a Federal Amendment.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1919, the State Legislature met in regular session and the\r\npoll in both Houses was entirely satisfactory in regard to ratifying\r\nthe Federal Amendment. The lawmakers were so gratified at the part\r\nplayed by the women during the war and the \"impeachment\" that they\r\nwere ready and anxious to grant anything wanted of them, in fact were\r\ndisappointed that so little was asked. It was not deemed necessary to\r\nhave a large lobby and only Mrs. Jessie Daniel Ames of Georgetown came\r\nto Austin to assist the chairman. A resolution offered by Judge W. H.\r\nBledsoe of Lubbock county and Senator R. M. Dudley of El Paso county,\r\nwhich was enthusiastically adopted by both Houses the second day of\r\nthe session, after complimenting highly the voting of the women at the\r\nprimaries, said: \"Resolved, That the United States Senate is hereby\r\nrespectfully but urgently requested to act immediately and favorably\r\nupon the woman suffrage amendment, which has already received proper\r\nrecognition by the House of Representatives; that such action is in\r\nfull accordance with enlightened sentiment which sees no reason for\r\nfurther delay.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately many friends, both men and women, were misled into\r\nbelieving that it would now be possible to win a complete suffrage\r\nvictory in Texas, although 260,000 real American voters were away on\r\naccount of the war and thousands of aliens remained at home to vote.\r\nBecause of the delay in Congress on the Federal Amendment both Houses\r\nsubmitted by unanimous vote an amendment to the State constitution. It\r\nwas handicapped by a \"rider\" which required full naturalization by\r\nevery foreign-born man before he could vote, instead of merely his\r\nfirst papers as now. This ensured a negative vote from every alien. A\r\ntelegram to Washington summoned Mrs. Cunningham to return immediately\r\nand take command of the campaign, for it would be a Herculean task to\r\nmanage one successfully in less than three months' time in a State\r\nconsisting of 253 counties and the vote to be taken May 24. It was\r\nimpossible for the State association to finance such a campaign and\r\nthe National Association, although disapproving of the referendum,\r\ncontributed about $17,000.\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson sent a cablegram from Paris urging the voters to give\r\nthe amendment their support and the members of his administration used\r\ntheir influence in its favor. The State officials championed it and\r\nthe party organization of the State and many in the counties put\r\nthemselves behind it. All of the daily newspapers but one in the four\r\nlargest cities advocated it. Almost every minister labored earnestly\r\nfor it, many of them preaching in favor of it. Many excellent women\r\nengaged in the campaign, some of them even speaking on the street\r\ncorners. The district, city and county chairmen of the State suffrage\r\nassociation totaled 400 earnest, active women with whom the\r\nheadquarters kept in close touch through letters, press bulletins,\r\ntelephone and telegraph. These chairmen were the medium through which\r\n3,000,000 fliers and 200,000 copies of the _Texas Democrat_, an\r\nexcellent paper edited for the occasion by Dr. A. Caswell Ellis of\r\nthe State University faculty, reached the voters. More than ninety\r\nsmall papers issued a four page suffrage supplement furnished them.\r\nThe list of speakers included 1,495 names and almost no meeting or\r\nconvention of any importance was held during the latter part of the\r\nthree months that did not make room on its program for a talk on woman\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand every nook and corner of the State was flooded with\r\nanti-suffrage literature, a great deal of it emanating from U. S.\r\nSenator Reed of Missouri, of such a vile, insinuating character that\r\nwhen placed by the \"antis\" upon the desks of the legislators they\r\nquickly passed protesting resolutions with only five dissenting votes.\r\nThese called attention to the splendid work of Texas women during the\r\nwar and their suffering at the absence and loss of their loved ones;\r\ndeclared that this literature was \"nothing short of a slap in the face\r\nof these good women and of the members who passed, by a unanimous\r\nvote, the woman suffrage amendment,\" and said: \"Resolved that we go\r\nupon record as condemning the circulation of this character of\r\nliterature and opposed to the sentiments expressed therein. We\r\nre-affirm our allegiance to the woman suffrage amendment ... and when\r\nwe return to our homes we will do all in our power to secure the\r\npassage of this amendment.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the most vicious literature was from a so-called \"Man's\r\nOrganization Opposed to Woman Suffrage,\" with headquarters in Selma,\r\nAla. Former U. S. Senator Bailey, who had been residing in New York\r\nfor some years, made a speaking tour of the State, assailing the\r\namendment in the most vindictive manner.[182]\r\n\r\nThe Women's National Anti-Suffrage Association sent Miss Charlotte\r\nRowe of New York, who spoke and worked against the amendment. Mrs.\r\nJames W. Wadsworth, Jr., president of this association, accompanied by\r\nher husband, the U. S. Senator, came into the State during the\r\ncampaign and held some parlor meetings. She appointed Mrs. James B.\r\nWells, wife of the political \"boss of the borderland\" at Brownsville,\r\nto send out literature, speak where possible, etc. Mrs. Wells had\r\nheadquarters in Austin with Mrs. Darden and their work was done from\r\nthere. The amendment failed but not because of their feeble efforts.\r\nIt was opposed by the strongest political forces in Texas, including\r\nthe liquor interests. The vote was 141,773 ayes, 166,893 noes;\r\ndefeated by a majority of 25,120.\r\n\r\nIn eleven days after this defeat--on June 4--the Federal Woman\r\nSuffrage Amendment was submitted by Congress to the Legislatures for\r\nratification. Both of the Texas Senators--Charles A. Culberson and\r\nMorris Sheppard--and nine Representatives voted for it.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. Governor Hobby issued a call for a second special\r\nsession of the Legislature to convene June 23 to consider other\r\nmatters but the opening day found the suffragists on hand ready to ask\r\nfor ratification. The \"antis\" were on hand also and while they were\r\nholding a conference in the Driskill Hotel to devise ways and means of\r\nobtaining a hearing before the House committee, Resolution No. 1 to\r\nratify the amendment was read the first time in the House and referred\r\nto this committee. The \"antis\" came in just in time to learn that the\r\ncommittee had held its meeting, favorably reported the resolution and\r\nit had been made the special order of business for 11 o'clock the next\r\nmorning. All of this occurred before noon of the first day.\r\n\r\nSpeaker R. E. Thomason was one of the most ardent supporters of the\r\nresolution and promptly on the hour it was brought up. As a poll of\r\nthe House had shown that it was safe, the leaders decided not to\r\nchoose between the dozens who wanted to speak in its behalf but to let\r\nthe \"antis\" do the talking since the \"pros\" had the votes. The \"father\r\nof the House,\" Representative King of Erath, alone spoke for it but\r\nthe opponents talked until 3:55 p. m., when some one moved the\r\nprevious question. The vote stood 96 ayes, 20 noes. As the Senate\r\ncommittee hearing was set for 4 o'clock there could be no thought of\r\nlunch but only to hurry to its room in the far removed wing of the\r\nCapitol. That hearing can never be adequately described.\r\nEx-Congressman Robert W. Henry and State Senator J. C. McNealus,\r\nfire-eating \"antis,\" almost came to blows over the name of former\r\nGovernor Ferguson, and Miss Rowe, the New York crusader, had a\r\ndifficult time with questions. The chairman was instructed to report\r\nfavorably and in the Senate the real fight was on.\r\n\r\nThe opposition tried every conceivable method to defer or defeat.\r\nHeckling, threats, fervid oratory had no effect on the favoring\r\nSenators. Filibustering continued all through Wednesday and Thursday,\r\nexcept when the Senate recessed to listen to Governor Brough of\r\nArkansas, who touched on the justice of suffrage for women in an\r\neffective manner. Finally their swan song was due and came from\r\nSenator W. A. Johnston of Houston, intimate friend of ex-Senator\r\nBailey. Senator Paul Page of Bastrop ably led the fight in behalf of\r\nthe resolution. On June 27, at 7 p. m., it passed to third reading by\r\na vote of 18 to 9, with one pair and one absentee. That night the\r\nopposition tried to get enough Senators out of town to break the\r\nquorum but the friendly members and the women \"shadowed\" the\r\npassengers on all out-going trains. On June 28 by a viva voce vote the\r\nSenate went on record as the ninth State to ratify the Federal\r\nSuffrage Amendment, the actual strength being 19 to 10, with one\r\nabsent. Lieutenant Governor W. A. Johnson proved his friendship and\r\nloyalty to the cause of woman suffrage by remaining in the chair\r\nconstantly during the four days' contest.\r\n\r\nWith the women of Texas soon to be fully enfranchised the State Equal\r\nSuffrage Association in October, 1919, merged into the State League of\r\nWomen Voters, with Mrs. Jessie Daniel Ames chairman.[183]\r\n\r\n[LAWS. An excellent digest of the laws for women and children\r\naccompanied this chapter, showing considerable advance since a résumé\r\nwas given in Volume IV of the History of Woman Suffrage. The writer of\r\nthe present chapter insists that they never were so unjust as there\r\nrepresented. The omission of the laws from this, as from the other\r\nState chapters for lack of space is a loss to the History.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[177] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Jane Y.\r\nMcCallum, member of the Executive Board of the State Equal Suffrage\r\nAssociation as chairman of the Legislative Committee, the Ratification\r\nCommittee and the Publicity Committee.\r\n\r\n[178] It is a matter of much regret that the dramatic account sent of\r\nthis remarkable campaign must be omitted because of the pressing lack\r\nof space.--Ed.\r\n\r\n[179] See Primary suffrage in Arkansas chapter.\r\n\r\n[180] Judge F. G. Chambliss of the 36th District Court, who was\r\ndefeated for reelection at this time, claimed that it was due to votes\r\nof women and brought suit in the 79th District Court at Corpus Christi\r\nto test the legality of the Primary Law. Judge V. M. Taylor ruled that\r\nit was unconstitutional. In another case an injunction was sought to\r\nrestrain the tax collector of McLennan county from issuing poll tax\r\nreceipts to women. The Appellate and Supreme Courts upheld the\r\nconstitutionality of the law.\r\n\r\n[181] The speech of Morris Sheppard delivered in the U. S. Senate Aug.\r\n5, 1918, was one of the strongest arguments ever made for the Federal\r\nSuffrage Amendment.--Ed.\r\n\r\n[182] After women got the Primary vote Mr. Bailey returned to Texas\r\nand announced himself a candidate for Governor. He was overwhelmingly\r\ndefeated at the primaries and his comment was: \"The women and the\r\npreachers did it.\"\r\n\r\n[183] The following women besides those mentioned have held office in\r\nthe association since 1900: Mesdames Tex Armstrong, Anna B.

M.\r\nWallis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nUTAH.[184]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe results of equal suffrage in Utah for fifty years--1870-1920--with\r\nan unavoidable interim of eight years, have demonstrated the sanity\r\nand poise of women in the exercise of their franchise. The Mormon\r\nwomen had had long training, for from the founding of their church by\r\nJoseph Smith in 1830 they had a vote in its affairs. Although the\r\nTerritory of Wyoming was the first to give the suffrage to women--in\r\nNovember, 1869--the Legislature of Utah followed in January, 1870, and\r\nthe bill was signed by Governor S. A. Mann February 12. Women voted at\r\nthe regular election the next August and there was no election in\r\nWyoming until September, so those of Utah had the distinction of being\r\nthe pioneer women voters in the United States and there were over five\r\ntimes as many women in Utah as in Wyoming. The story of how their\r\nsuffrage was taken away by an Act of Congress in 1887 and how it was\r\nrestored in full by the men of Utah when they made their constitution\r\nfor statehood in 1895 and adopted it by a vote of ten to one is\r\nrelated in detail in Volume IV of the History of Woman Suffrage. The\r\nwomen have voted since then in large numbers, filled many offices and\r\nbeen a recognized political influence for the benefit of the State.\r\n\r\nThe large and active Territorial Woman Suffrage Association held\r\nannual conventions until after it succeeded in gaining the franchise.\r\nIn 1899, during a visit of Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt to Salt Lake City,\r\na meeting was called and steps taken to form a Utah Council of Women\r\nto assist the suffrage movement in other States and Mrs. Emily S.\r\nRichards was made president. This Council, composed of Mormons and\r\nnon-Mormons, continued in existence for twenty years. For the first\r\nten years there were monthly meetings and also special and committee\r\nmeetings and prominent speakers addressed the annual gatherings,\r\neulogizing and commemorating the lives and labors of the suffrage\r\npioneers throughout the Union. Whenever the National American Suffrage\r\nAssociation called for financial aid it responded liberally. The\r\nsuffrage having been gained it was hard to keep up the interest and\r\nafter 1910 meetings were held only at the call of the president for\r\nthe purpose of carrying out the wishes of the National Suffrage\r\nAssociation, at whose conventions the Council was always represented\r\nby delegates. In 1909-10, when the association was collecting its\r\nmonster petition to Congress, the Council obtained 40,000 names as\r\nUtah's quota.\r\n\r\nThe official personnel remained practically the same from 1900. That\r\nnoble exponent of the best there is in womanhood, Mrs. Emily S.\r\nRichards, preserved the spirit and genius of the Council, which\r\nrecognized no party and whose members cast their votes for good men\r\nand measures without undue partisan bias. She was sustained by its\r\ncapable and resourceful secretary, Mrs. Elizabeth M. Cohen, and both\r\nmaintained a non-partisan attitude in the conduct of the Council. The\r\nofficers were: Emmeline B. Wells, member national executive committee;\r\nElizabeth A. Hayward, Mrs. Ira D. Wines, Dr. Jane Skolfield and Mrs.\r\nB. T. Pyper, vice-presidents; Anna T. Piercey, assistant secretary;\r\nHannah S. Lapish, treasurer.\r\n\r\nAs Territory and State, every county, every town, every precinct has\r\nbeen served faithfully and well by women in various positions. It\r\nwould be impossible to name all who have done yeoman service during\r\nthe past years but the three women who have meant more than all others\r\nto the suffrage cause are Mrs. Sarah M. Kimball, who was appointed by\r\nBrigham Young and Eliza R. Snow as the standard bearer of that cause\r\nin the late '60's and who maintained her active hold upon politics\r\nuntil about 1885, when her able first lieutenant, Mrs. Emmeline B.\r\nWells, took up the work dropped by the aged hands of Mrs. Kimball. She\r\nin turn carried the banner of equal civic freedom aloft, assisted by\r\nMrs. Richards, until she relinquished it in 1896 and Mrs. Richards\r\nbecame the standard bearer. Many other splendid women have labored\r\nassiduously in this cause.\r\n\r\nIn legislative matters a committee from the Council has worked during\r\nevery session since 1911 with associated committees from the other\r\nlarge organizations of women, the powerful Relief Society, the Young\r\nLadies' Mutual Improvement Association and the Federated Clubs leading\r\nin all good movements. Results in the enactment of welfare laws for\r\nwomen and children have been very gratifying. The women's committees\r\nof the various organizations meet at the State Capitol during the\r\nlegislative sessions and go over very carefully every bill in which\r\nthey are interested. If after investigation a bill meets with their\r\napproval it is endorsed and every effort is made to secure its\r\npassage. From 1911 to 1917 the women's legislative committee secured\r\ncopies of laws already in successful operation in other States and\r\nframed bills to meet their own needs. These were always submitted to\r\ntwo young lawyers, Dan B. Shields and Carl Badger, who corrected any\r\nflaws which might jeopardize their constitutionality. Among the women\r\nwho comprise these committees are Mrs. Cohen, chairman, Miss Sarah\r\nMcLelland of the Relief Society; Mrs. Adella W. Eardley and Mrs. Julia\r\nBrixen of the Y. L. M. I. A.; Mrs. Richards and Mrs. Hayward of the\r\nSuffrage Council; Mrs. C. M. McMahon, president, Mrs. Peter A.\r\nSimpkin, Mrs. A. V. Taylor and Mrs. Seldon I. Clawson, members of the\r\nFederation of Women's Clubs.\r\n\r\nIn many Legislatures since statehood there have been women members and\r\ntheir work has been along expected lines. In 1896, the year Utah was\r\nadmitted to the Union, Dr. Martha Hughes Cannon was elected to the\r\nState Senate, the first woman in the United States to receive that\r\nhonor. Several women were elected to the Lower House then and others\r\nin the years following. Needed reform measures were secured by Mrs.\r\nMary G. Coulter, who sat in the Lower House and was made chairman of\r\nthe Judiciary Committee in 1903. There was a long interim when no\r\nwomen were sent to the Legislature but in 1913 four were elected, Mrs.\r\nAnnie Wells Cannon, Dr. Skolfield, Mrs. Elizabeth Ellerbeck Reid and\r\nMrs. Annie H. King. They were instrumental in securing the Mothers'\r\nPension Law and the Minimum Wage Law and through Mrs. Cannon the\r\nbureau of emigration labor was provided with a woman deputy to look\r\nafter the women and children workers. Utah already had an equal\r\nguardianship law but largely through the efforts of Mrs. Cannon it was\r\nimproved and is now regarded as a model and has been copied by other\r\nStates. She is a representative daughter of Mrs. Wells.\r\n\r\nIn 1915 Mrs. Elizabeth A. Hayward and Mrs. Lily C. Wolstenholme were\r\nelected and to the former the improved child labor law must be\r\ncredited. In 1917 she was re-elected and Dr. Grace Stratton Airy and\r\nMrs. Daisy C. Allen became members of the Lower House. During\r\n1915-1917 laws raising the age of protection for girls to 18 and\r\nrequiring equal pay for equal work were enacted. Mrs. Hayward, at the\r\nrequest of the women's Legislative Council, introduced the resolution\r\ncalling on Congress to submit the Federal Amendment. In 1918 she was\r\nelected State Senator. In 1919 Dr. Airy was re-elected and Mrs. Anna\r\nG. Piercy and Mrs. Delora Blakely were elected to the Lower House.\r\nAltogether there have been thirteen women members of the Legislature.\r\nNo State has better laws relating to women and children than Utah.\r\n\r\nIt has been difficult to persuade the women to stand for important\r\noffices. The modern furious pace set by campaigners and the severance\r\nof home ties for long periods are not alluring to wives and mothers\r\nbut they find many public activities through which to exercise their\r\nexecutive abilities. They sit on the boards of many State and local\r\ninstitutions and serve on committees for civic and educational work. A\r\nconsiderable number have filled and are now filling city and county\r\noffices. Mrs. L. M. Crawford has a responsible position in the office\r\nof the State Land Board. Mrs. McVickar was State Superintendent of\r\nSchools. In 1917 a new department was added to the office of the\r\nAdjutant General to secure pensions for those veterans who had served\r\nin the early Indian wars of Utah. Mrs. Elizabeth M. Cohen was given\r\ncustody of the old Indian War Records and was named Commissioner of\r\nPensions. In order to prove the claims of these men and women she\r\ncooperated with the Pension Bureau at Washington, D. C. Up to date out\r\nof a possible 1,500 whose claims have merit nearly 700 pensions have\r\nbeen granted, bringing into the State the sum of $400,000.\r\n\r\nWhen Brigham Young established those monuments to his name, the\r\nBrigham Young University of Provo and the Brigham Young College of\r\nLogan in 1874 he placed women on their boards. Mrs. Martha J. Coray of\r\nProvo served ten years for the former and Professor Ida M. Cook for\r\nthe latter. Mrs. Gates was made a trustee of the university in 1891,\r\nwhich position she still occupies, while her sister, Mrs. Zina Young\r\nCard, has been a trustee since 1914. Mrs. Gates was on the board of\r\nthe State Agricultural College 1905-1913. Mrs. A. W. McCune was on\r\nthis board ten years, seven of them its vice-president. Mrs. Rebecca\r\nM. Little, Mrs. Antoinette B. Kinney and Dr. Belle A. Gummel have been\r\nregents of the university. Professor Maude May Babcock has been dean\r\nof physical education and expression since 1892 and a trustee since\r\n1897. Her culture and personality have left an indelible impress on\r\nthe history of this State.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning women have allied themselves with the different\r\npolitical parties, occasionally uniting on a great issue like that of\r\nProhibition. From the time they were enfranchised by the State\r\nconstitution they have received the recognition of the parties. In\r\n1900 women were sent as delegates and alternates to both national\r\npresidential conventions and Mrs. Cohen seconded the nomination of\r\nWilliam Jennings Bryan. A number were sent in following years. In 1908\r\nMrs. Margaret Zane Cherdron was a delegate and a presidential elector,\r\ncarrying the vote to Washington. She was one of the two received by\r\nPresident Taft and was royally entertained while in the capital. Among\r\nother women who have acted as delegates and alternates since 1900 are\r\nMrs. William H. Jones, Mrs. Hayward, Mrs. Sarah Ventrees, Mrs. Gates,\r\nMrs. Lucy A. Clark, Mrs. B. T. Pyper, Mrs. L. M. Crawford, Mrs. Alice\r\nE. Paddison.\r\n\r\nWomen have their representation on all political committees--Mrs.\r\nHayward is a member of the Democratic National Committee--and their\r\nparticipation in politics is accepted without question. There are\r\nabout 10,000 more women voters than men voters. As a rule about 90 per\r\ncent. of the women vote and about 86 per cent. of the men, as some of\r\nthe latter are in the mines or out of the State for various reasons.\r\nAmong the Republican leaders are Mrs. Wells, Mrs. Gates, Mrs.\r\nCherdron, Mrs. Jannette A. Hyde, Mrs. Cannon, Mrs. Wolstenholm, Mrs.\r\nLoufborough, Mrs. William Spry, Mrs. Reed Smoot; Mrs. Martha B.\r\nKeeler of Provo and Mrs. Georgina G. Marriott of Ogden. The Democratic\r\nparty has had among its leading women Mrs. Richards, Mrs. Alice\r\nMerrill Horne, Mrs. Cohen, Mrs. Hayward, Gwen Lewis Little, Mrs.\r\nPiercy, Mrs. S. S. Smith, Mrs. Annice Dee, Mrs. Inez Knight Allen and\r\nMiss Alice Reynolds.\r\n\r\nNo State exceeded Utah in the proportion of the work done by women\r\nduring the World War. Mrs. Clarissa Smith Williams was the unanimous\r\nchoice for chairman of the State branch of the Woman's Council of\r\nNational Defense. She was eminently fitted for this position through\r\nher long experience as first counsellor to Mrs. Emmeline B. Wells,\r\nhead of the Relief Society, and every demand of the Government was\r\nfully met.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. At the request of the Suffrage Council and without\r\nurging, Governor Simon Bamberger called a special session of the\r\nLegislature for Sept. 30, 1919, to ratify the Federal Suffrage\r\nAmendment submitted the preceding June. The resolution was presented\r\nby Senator Elizabeth A. Hayward and was ratified unanimously by both\r\nHouses within thirty minutes. The Governor signed it without delay.\r\nThe women and the Legislature had helped in every possible way to\r\nsecure the Amendment and the entire Utah delegation in Congress had\r\nvoted for it.\r\n\r\nA striking event in the train of possible fruitful activities left\r\nbehind was the visit of the great leader, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,\r\npresident of the National American Suffrage Association, with her able\r\nyoung assistants, who came to Utah for Nov. 16-18, 1919. She was\r\naccompanied by Dr. Valerie Parker and Mrs. Jean Nelson Penfield,\r\nchairmen in the National League of Women Voters, and Miss Marjorie\r\nShuler, director of publicity for the National Association. The\r\nconvention, held in the Assembly Hall, was in charge of the Suffrage\r\nCouncil, its president, Mrs. Richards, assisted by Mrs. Cohen and Mrs.\r\nE. E. Corfman. A long and valuable program was carried out. Mrs. Catt\r\nspoke in the Tabernacle on Sunday afternoon, introduced by President\r\nCharles W. Penrose with a glowing tribute to her power as a leader, to\r\nthe sincerity and womanliness of her character and to the catholicity\r\nof her vision and sympathy. There were banquets, teas and receptions.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the convention the Suffrage Council, which had\r\nrendered such splendid service for the past twenty years, was merged\r\ninto the State League of Women Voters and Mrs. Richards willingly\r\nresigned her leadership to its chairman, Mrs. Clesson S. Kinney.\r\n\r\nOn Feb. 12, 1920, a jubilee celebration was held in honor of the\r\nfiftieth anniversary of the signing of the woman suffrage bill by the\r\nTerritorial Governor S. A. Mann. There was also celebrated the\r\ngranting of the complete franchise by the immense majority of the\r\nvoters in 1895.\r\n\r\nUtah celebrated in Salt Lake City August 30, with a great\r\ndemonstration, the triumph of woman suffrage in the United States\r\nthrough the ratification of the Federal Amendment, which had been\r\nproclaimed August 26. It was introduced with an impressive parade led\r\nby bands of music and the program of ceremonies was carried out on the\r\nsteps of the State Capitol. Governor Bamberger, former Governor Heber\r\nM. Wells, Congressman E. O. Leatherwood and Mayor C. Clarence Neslen\r\njoined the women in congratulatory addresses. Mrs. Richards, Mrs.\r\nHannah Lapish and Mrs. Lydia Alder, veteran suffragists, told of the\r\nearly struggles and Mrs. Beulah Storrs Lewis appealed to women to keep\r\nhigh the standard in order to lead men out of the darkness of war into\r\nthe light of brotherly love and make ready for world peace. Mrs. Annie\r\nWells Cannon and Mrs. Susa Young Gates were appointed to send a\r\ntelegram of congratulation to Mrs. Catt. The celebration was under the\r\nauspices of the League of Women Voters, whose chairman, Mrs. Kinney,\r\npresided. The most impressive figure on the platform was President\r\nEmmeline B. Wells, 92 years old, who had voted since 1870 and who had\r\nlabored all these years for this glorious achievement. What those dim\r\neyes had seen of history in the making, what those old ears had heard\r\nand what that clear brain had conceived and carried out only her close\r\nassociates knew. She was the incarnate figure of tender, delicate,\r\neternally determined womanhood, arrived and triumphant.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[184] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Susa Young\r\nGates, member of the General Board of the Woman's Relief Society and\r\neditor of the Relief Society's Magazine since it was established in\r\n1913 and historian of the activities of Utah women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nVERMONT.[185]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first convention to consider woman suffrage took place in Vermont\r\nin 1883, when a State association was formed, and others were held\r\nregularly to the end of the century, with the cooperation of the\r\nMassachusetts association. At the convention held in Waterbury Center\r\nJune 12, 13, 1900, Henry B. Blackwell of Boston, editor of the\r\n_Woman's Journal_, was the chief speaker. Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,\r\nthe new president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association,\r\nsent a letter of helpful suggestions. Petitions for a Federal Suffrage\r\nAmendment were forwarded to Congress. During this and the following\r\nyears the _Woman's Journal_ was sent to members of the Legislature; a\r\ncolumn prepared from that paper was sent to every editor in the State\r\nand much literature was distributed, the Woman's Christian Temperance\r\nUnion assisting.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1901 met in Rochester June 25, 26. The speakers were\r\nMr. Blackwell, Professor W. L. Burdick, the Rev. George L. Story, Miss\r\nEliza Eaton, Miss Blanche Dunham and Mrs. Laura Kezer, president of\r\nthe W. C. T. U. The convention congratulated women of the Methodist\r\nEpiscopal Church on their admission as delegates to the General\r\nConference, the Vermont conference having voted for it unanimously.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 the convention met at West Concord June 18, 19, among the\r\nspeakers being Miss Mary N. Chase, president of the New Hampshire\r\nSuffrage Association, and Mr. Blackwell, who never missed a\r\nconvention.[186] The State Baptist Association went on record this\r\nyear in favor of women voting on license and prohibition and the\r\nUniversalist Church convention endorsed equal suffrage.\r\n\r\nIn 1903 the convention was held at Barton June 9, 10, with Mrs. Ida\r\nPorter Boyer, a national organizer, among the speakers. The convention\r\nof 1904 went to Woodstock, June 22, 23, and was addressed by the Rev.\r\nHarry L. and Mrs. Canfield, suffrage leaders there, and many others.\r\nIt was announced that Mrs. Dorcas McClelan of Glover had left a\r\nbequest of $150 to the association. A \"composition\" entitled Female\r\nEducation, written by a pupil in a Woodstock school in 1831, now Mrs.\r\nHarriet Walker of Denver, 90 years old, was read and much enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1905 took place in Springfield June 7, 8. During the\r\nyear 10,000 copies of Opinions on Equal Suffrage by Vermont Men and\r\nWomen had been distributed and the _Woman's Journal_ placed in twelve\r\nlibraries. A memorial service was held for Mrs. Mary A. Livermore, a\r\nlife long suffragist. In 1906 the convention was held at Brattleboro\r\nJune 6, 7, with a long list of State speakers, including six\r\nclergymen. A memorial service with tributes of appreciation was held\r\nfor Miss Susan B. Anthony.\r\n\r\nBurlington entertained the convention June 13, 14, 1907, which had the\r\nprivilege of hearing Mayor W. J. Bigelow, Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, now\r\npresident of the National Association, and State Representative H. H.\r\nShaw of Burlington. Mr. Blackwell presented a fine portrait of his\r\nwife, Lucy Stone. Four prominent State workers had died during the\r\nyear, the Hon. Henry Ballard, C. W. Wyman, Miss Carolyn Scott and Miss\r\nLaura Moore, the latter for twenty-two years secretary of the State\r\nassociation, its leader and inspirer. She was known at the Capitol as\r\n\"the Saint of Barnet\" and U. S. Senator Carroll S. Page once said: \"If\r\nthe cause of equal suffrage should ever prevail in Vermont it will be\r\nlargely because of the seed sown by Laura Moore.\" Miss Scott, her\r\ncompanion and co-worker, who passed away in her 92d year, left a\r\nbequest of $1,000 to the association.\r\n\r\nAt the convention in Rutland Oct. 12, 13, 1908, among the speakers\r\nwere the Reverend Mary Traffern Whitney and Mrs. Annette W. Parmelee,\r\nState superintendent of press. The association voted to become\r\nauxiliary to the National Association. A letter was read from former\r\nGovernor Fletcher D. Proctor, declaring himself in favor of the\r\nmovement and willing to assist it. Signatures to the suffrage petition\r\nthis year included the names of Governor George H. Prouty, Lieutenant\r\nGovernor John Abner Mead and Secretary of State Guy Bailey.\r\n\r\nIn 1909 the convention held at Barre June 4, 5, decided to concentrate\r\nits efforts on a State constitutional amendment to be voted on in\r\n1910. A press report of the convention said: \"Henry B. Blackwell,\r\nalthough 84 years of age, is a commanding figure and his voice as it\r\nrings forth in tones of conviction is more like that of a man in his\r\nprime than of one who has passed his four-score milestone.\" It\r\ntherefore was a great shock when the news came on September 7 that\r\nthis far-visioned leader had passed from earth. The State suffragists\r\nowed him a debt of gratitude which could only be repaid by carrying\r\nforward his life work.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 and 1911 the association so sadly bereft by death held no\r\nconvention but the work did not cease. Miss Chase, now a national\r\norganizer, formed new leagues; Mrs. Parmelee sent out 3,057 pieces of\r\nmail, circularized the clergy, conducted thirty-seven debates, wrote\r\n131 newspaper articles, furnished leaflets to ninety W. C. T. U.\r\nunits, sent _Woman's Journals_ to every graded school and every\r\nlibrary in the State and circulated literature at the county fairs.\r\nShe also prepared a leaflet, Seventeen Reasons Why Women Should Vote,\r\nwrote and superintended the production of a play entitled A Mock\r\nSession of the Legislature and spoke at legislative sessions,\r\nchurches, granges and parlor meetings. She was ably assisted in this\r\nwork by the secretary, Mrs. Canfield, who had charge of the large\r\nVermont and New Hampshire tent at the State Fair at White River\r\nJunction, where speeches were made, literature distributed and\r\nsignatures obtained. Fourteen speakers were kept busy. The pastors of\r\nall the churches in the State were circularized and as a rule were\r\nsympathetic.[187]\r\n\r\nIn 1912 the convention was held at Montpelier on June 7, with\r\nProfessor George B. Cox of Dartmouth College; Attorney J. H. Senter\r\nand Dr. J. Edward Wright among the speakers. At Woodstock a big\r\nsuffrage \"rally\" was held with Dr. Harvey W. Wiley of Washington as\r\nchief speaker. Mrs. Frances Rastall, recently appointed State\r\ncongressional chairman by the National Association, organized a\r\ncongressional committee in every county. At the convention in\r\nRochester June 11, 12, 1913, Mrs. Emily Chaffee of Detroit, Mich., and\r\nmany State speakers made addresses. Mrs. Julia Pierce, the State\r\npresident, handsomely entertained speakers and delegates at her home.\r\nAt St. Albans a successful \"rally\" with Mrs. Marian Booth Kelly as\r\nspeaker was held.\r\n\r\nIn 1914 the convention was held in Burlington November 4, 5, and the\r\ncity hall was crowded at the evening meetings. Mrs. Beatrice Forbes\r\nRobertson Hale of New York and Mrs. Maud Wood Park of Boston were the\r\nout-of-town speakers and Representative E. P. Jose of Johnson headed\r\nthe State coterie. Conforming to plans sent out by the National\r\nAssociation, \"suffrage day\" had been observed May 1 in Burlington with\r\nan address by Mayor James E. Burke.\r\n\r\nThe convention which met at Springfield Oct. 20, 21, 1915, received a\r\nroyal welcome. American flags and suffrage banners were suspended\r\nacross the streets and the stores were decorated with yellow. A\r\nreception and banquet were given by Mr. and Mrs. W. D. Woolson at\r\nMucross Park. Among the speakers were Miss Alice Stone Blackwell,\r\nArthur P. Howard, editor of _The Advance_; the Hon. James Hartness,\r\nDr. Grace Sherwood and Representative H. E. Taylor. Mrs. Pierce,\r\nhaving served six years as president, asked to be released and was\r\nmade honorary president for life. Mrs. Lucia E. Blanchard was elected\r\nin her place. The convention deplored the opposing attitude of\r\nCongressman Frank Greene and of U. S. Senator William P. Dillingham,\r\nwho had declared himself \"unalterably opposed\" to the Federal Suffrage\r\nAmendment, and it commended the stand of Congressman Porter Dale.\r\nAmong public officials declaring themselves favorable were U. S.\r\nMarshal Horace W. Bailey, Dr. Guy Potter Benton, president of the\r\nUniversity of Vermont, and J. N. Barss, superintendent of the State\r\nIndustrial School.\r\n\r\nOn March 1, 1916, Mrs. Rastall called a congressional conference in\r\nBurlington. Mrs. Catt, national president, and Mrs. Susan W.\r\nFitzgerald of Boston addressed a large audience. The day sessions were\r\nat the City Hall and the mass meeting at the Strong Theater. During\r\nthe autumn a delegation of suffragists called on U. S. Senator Carroll\r\nS. Page of Hyde Park to urge his support of the Federal Suffrage\r\nAmendment. They were graciously received, entertained at luncheon at\r\nthe Inn and reported themselves as \"pleased with the interview.\" In\r\nNovember the National Association sent Mrs. Augusta Hughston, one of\r\nits organizers, for a month's field work, paying all expenses, and\r\neighteen clubs were formed with officers and active committees.\r\n\r\nIn 1917 the convention was held at St. Albans June 27, 28, with the\r\nusual list of good speakers. Mrs. Lilian H. Olzendam was employed as\r\nState organizer. A resolution was passed condemning the methods of the\r\n\"militant\" suffragists. It was reported that after an address by Mrs.\r\nRastall at the State conference of the Federation of Labor at Bellows\r\nFalls August 11, 12, woman suffrage was endorsed unanimously.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the plans of the National Association to strengthen\r\nthe situation wherever there were opposing members of Congress, and to\r\nassist in bringing pressure on Senator Dillingham, Mrs. Halsey W.\r\nWilson, its recording secretary, was sent to Vermont in July, 1918,\r\nand also Miss Marjorie Shuler, its director of field publicity, who\r\nspent two weeks, speaking, interviewing editors and building up\r\nfavorable press sentiment. The convention was held at Burlington July\r\n10, 11 and was addressed by Mrs. Wilson, Mrs. A. L. Bailey, State\r\npresident; Mrs. Joanna Croft Read, State secretary, and Dr. Alice\r\nWakefield. A resolution was adopted thanking Senator Page for his\r\npromise to support the Federal Suffrage Amendment. Senator Dillingham\r\nstill remained obdurate and Mrs. Wilson returned to meet with the\r\nExecutive Board August 17 at Montpelier, after which Mrs. Bailey, Mrs.\r\nRead, Mrs. Parmelee, Mrs. Olzendam and Mrs. Wilson called on him by\r\nappointment to appeal for his vote. He was very courteous but gave\r\nthem no encouragement. Mrs. Wilson remained for three weeks conferring\r\nwith and assisting the workers. In November, at the expense of the\r\nNational Association, Mrs. Hughston spent three weeks doing valuable\r\nfield work.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1919, Mrs. Wilson again returned to assist the board\r\nduring the legislative session, remaining until after the convention,\r\nwhich was held at Burlington March 11, 12. The speakers were Mrs.\r\nCatt, Mrs. Wilson, Dr. Marion Horton, the new State president; City\r\nAttorney Hamilton S. Peck, Miss Bernice Tuttle, president of the Child\r\nWelfare Bureau; Mrs. Anna Hawkes Putnam, State chairman of the Woman's\r\nDivision of the National Council of Defense; Mrs. M. D. Chittenden,\r\npresident of the State Y. W. C. A., and others. Mrs. Parmelee gave an\r\naccount of the work for woman suffrage in Vermont and its courageous\r\nleaders during the past thirty-six years and the reasons why bills\r\nwere voted down in the Legislature.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. On June 4, 1919, the Federal Suffrage Amendment was\r\nsubmitted to the Legislatures for ratification and a survey showed\r\nthat Vermont's would probably be necessary to make the needed 36. Mrs.\r\nHalsey Wilson returned for consultation with the State leaders and an\r\nintensive effort was begun which continued for more than a year. Mrs.\r\nOlzendam, chairman of ratification, not only obtained enough favorable\r\npledges from the members to ratify but an agreement by a majority to\r\npay their own expenses, and give their time for a special session. It\r\nwas soon evident, however, that Governor Percival W. Clement was\r\ndetermined not to call one. Every possible influence was brought to\r\nbear on him but he based his refusal on the ground that it would be\r\nunconstitutional. By March, 1920, 35 States had ratified and it seemed\r\nthat the 36th would have to be Vermont or Connecticut, whose Governor\r\nalso had refused to call a special session.\r\n\r\nAn ingenious demonstration was decided on, which was made possible by\r\na contribution of $1,000 from the Leslie Suffrage Commission. An\r\ninterview of Vermont women with the Governor was arranged by a good\r\nfriend of suffrage, Major Harvey Goodell, secretary of Civil and\r\nMilitary Affairs. On April 21, a remarkable deputation of 400 women\r\narrived in Montpelier, representing twelve of the fourteen counties,\r\nloyal, ardent soldiers, overcoming the obstacles of long distances,\r\nalmost impassable roads and poor train service, many coming from towns\r\nwhere there were no trains and where they must plow through deep snow\r\nand over muddy and rocky roads, one woman walking five miles. Led by\r\nMrs. Olzendam in a cold, drenching rain they marched through the\r\nstreets and up the steps of the Capitol and took their places before\r\nthe Governor's chair. One by one, fourteen speakers presented the case\r\nin a few sentences. It was a notable demonstration in size, enthusiasm\r\nand determination. It had been arranged that letters and telegrams\r\nshould arrive the day before, the day of and the day following the\r\nvisit and his excellency received 1,600 communications in three days.\r\nGovernor Clement's only response was that he did not wish to make a\r\ndecision at present.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1920, the State Republican convention, with the Governor\r\nseated on the platform, passed a resolution urging him to call a\r\nspecial session, saying: \"We have full faith and confidence that the\r\nvoters of the State, regardless of party affiliation, would cordially\r\napprove and endorse the ratification of the Federal Suffrage\r\nAmendment.\"\r\n\r\nThe State suffrage convention met in the roof garden of The Tavern,\r\nSt. Albans, July 1, 2, in a rousing convention. Governor John H.\r\nBartlett of New Hampshire, which had ratified, was the guest of honor,\r\nattending by special request of Will Hays, chairman of the National\r\nRepublican Committee. He had consulted Governor Clement about coming,\r\nwho answered: \"I shall be glad to have you. Regret I shall be unable\r\nto hear you.\" Miss Katharine Ludington, chairman of the Connecticut\r\nLeague of Women Voters, and Miss Julia A. Hinaman, its press\r\nchairman, were among the speakers. Mayor Charles A. Buck extended the\r\nfreedom of the city and Mrs. Read, acting president, responded. On the\r\nplatform were a large number of prominent Vermont men and women. The\r\nreport of Mrs. Olzendam described the strenuous efforts of the women\r\nof the State for an extra session, acknowledging the assistance of\r\nMiss Ann Batchelder, Mrs. Vida M. Chase and others and thanking Mrs.\r\nWilson, Mrs. Raymond Brown, fourth vice-president, and Miss Shuler, of\r\nthe National Association; Mrs. Sara Algeo, president of the Woman\r\nSuffrage Party of Rhode Island, and Miss Winifred Brown of Utah for\r\ntheir help. The delegates expressed in applause and in words their\r\nhigh appreciation of Mrs. Olzendam's work. A resolution was passed at\r\nan evening mass meeting calling upon Governor Clement to summon a\r\nspecial session in order that Vermont might have the honor of being\r\nthe 36th State to ratify.\r\n\r\nJust before the convention the Governor went to Washington and the\r\npress dispatches of July 1 told of a long talk he had that day with\r\nPresident-elect Harding. Both men admitted in interviews that the\r\ncalling of a special session in Vermont had been discussed. Senator\r\nHarding said he told the Governor he would be very glad to see this\r\ndone but made plain his desire not to interfere with the Governor's\r\nprerogatives. Governor Clement frankly admitted that he had been urged\r\nby Senator Harding, Chairman Hays and other Republican leaders to give\r\nan early call but made the stereotyped excuses. Nevertheless the press\r\ngenerally expressed the opinion that he would yield. On the contrary\r\nhe returned home and on July 12 issued an official proclamation in\r\nwhich he made the assertion that \"the Federal Constitution in its\r\npresent form threatened the foundation of free popular government; the\r\n16th Amendment, providing for a federal income tax, was lobbied\r\nthrough Congress and State Legislatures by federal agents and the 18th\r\nAmendment for Federal prohibition was forced through by paid agents of\r\nirresponsible organizations with unlimited funds.\" To what he called\r\nthe proposal to \"force through the 19th Amendment for woman suffrage\r\nin the same manner,\" he said: \"I will never be a party to any\r\nproceeding which proposes to change the organic law of the State\r\nwithout the consent of the people.\" \"The National Constitution,\" he\r\nsaid, \"threatens free popular government alike as it stands and as it\r\nis interpreted by the Supreme Court. Its decision leaves the people at\r\nthe mercy of any group of men who may lobby a proposal for a change in\r\nit through Congress and then through the Legislatures.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, national president, issued an open letter to\r\nthe Governor in the course of which she said:\r\n\r\n     In order that this generation of your fellowmen and posterity\r\n     also may not misunderstand your position, the National American\r\n     Woman Suffrage Association urges you to supplement your\r\n     proclamation with answers to the following questions: Do you\r\n     challenge the fact which has stood unchallenged for 131 years\r\n     that the Federal Constitution is the supreme law of this land and\r\n     supersedes all State constitutions whenever the two are in\r\n     conflict? Do you know that on Jan. 10, 1791, Vermont ratified\r\n     that Constitution, although she had one of her own, and by so\r\n     doing accepted the precedence of the Federal Constitution and by\r\n     that act was admitted into the Union? If you do know these facts\r\n     of common knowledge why did you throw over your refusal to call a\r\n     special session the camouflage of a dissertation about the\r\n     alleged conflict between the Vermont and Federal Constitutions\r\n     which has nothing whatever to do with the calling of a special\r\n     session of your Legislature?... Do you not know that when a\r\n     Legislature acts upon a Federal constitutional amendment it draws\r\n     its authority from the Federal and not from the State\r\n     constitution, and that the Governor has no responsible part in\r\n     the transaction except as custodian of the amendment when it\r\n     comes from the Federal Secretary of State and returns to him with\r\n     the Certificate of Ratification? Then why profess such a burden\r\n     of personal responsibility in the matter?\r\n\r\n     You pretend to fear \"an invasion of State's Rights\" and take upon\r\n     yourself the responsibility of preserving \"the foundations of\r\n     free popular government.\" Then why did you veto the Presidential\r\n     suffrage bill passed by the Legislature of Vermont in 1919, which\r\n     was strictly a State action and conferred the vote upon the women\r\n     of Vermont alone?... Your national party convention in 1920\r\n     called for completion of ratification in time for women to vote\r\n     for the next President. Your party's National Committee in the\r\n     interim of conventions took action three times--once asking\r\n     Congress to submit the amendment; once favoring early\r\n     ratification and once calling upon Republican Governors to call\r\n     special sessions in order that ratification might proceed. Your\r\n     State party convention, your party's State Committee, your State\r\n     Legislature, hundreds of Vermont women, the chairman of the\r\n     National Republican Committee and the chairman of your State\r\n     Republican Committee, the candidate for President of your\r\n     party--all have asked you to call a special session.... You owe\r\n     it to the Republican party and to the world to explain your\r\n     assumption of an authority that belongs to your party leaders. By\r\n     what right do you make this assumption? Governor Clement, tell it\r\n     all!\"\r\n\r\nThe total cost of the efforts to secure a special session was $7,442,\r\nof which the National Association paid $2,578 and the Leslie Woman\r\nSuffrage Commission $4,864.[188]\r\n\r\nFollowing the convention of the State association at St. Albans, July\r\n1, 2, 1920, Miss Ludington explained the purpose of the National\r\nLeague of Women Voters and the association was dissolved and a State\r\nleague organized with Mrs. Lilian Olzendam chairman.\r\n\r\nThe Vermont suffrage association was fortunate in always having the\r\nsupport of other State organizations, the Woman's Christian Temperance\r\nUnion, Grange, Federation of Labor, Teachers' Association, Federation\r\nof Women's Clubs, Young Women's Christian Association and, in the\r\nclosing years, of all political parties. Among other noted speakers\r\nfrom outside the State not mentioned were Professor Charles Zueblin,\r\nMrs. Florence Kelley and Mrs. Susan S. Fessenden, president of the\r\nMassachusetts W. C. T. U. Over fifty clergymen of various\r\ndenominations gave active assistance.[189]\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. From 1884 to 1900 a bill to give Municipal\r\nsuffrage to taxpaying women was regularly introduced in the\r\nLegislature only to be defeated.\r\n\r\n1902. The Town and Municipal Suffrage bill in the Senate was defeated\r\nby 22 to 6; in the House by 111 to 75. A Presidential suffrage bill\r\nreceived only six votes. A bill permitting women to vote on the\r\nlicense question was defeated by 138 to 67. Petitions with 15,000\r\nsignatures had been presented for these various measures.\r\n\r\n1904. The Municipal Suffrage bill was reported favorably to the House\r\nby C. C. Fitts, chairman of the committee, but was refused third\r\nreading by 99 to 97. On November 17 it was introduced in the Senate,\r\nreported favorably by committee chairman J. Emery Buxton and passed\r\nwithout debate with three opposing votes. When on December 6 it came\r\nagain before the House for reconsideration it was ordered to a third\r\nreading by 112 to 104 but the next day was defeated by 124 to 100.\r\n\r\n1906. A bill to substitute the word \"person\" for \"male\" in the\r\nstatutes came before the House October 24, was ordered to third\r\nreading by 149 to 24 and passed the following day by 130 to 25. This\r\nmajority aroused the Massachusetts Society Opposed to the Further\r\nExtension of Suffrage to Women and an officer, Mrs. A. J. George of\r\nBrookline, was sent to try to defeat the bill. She was coolly received\r\nand found it so impossible to convince the members that she was not an\r\nemissary of the liquor interests that she failed to obtain even a\r\nhearing before the committee. Her coming stirred the suffrage forces\r\nand a telegram was sent to the _Woman's Journal_ of Boston asking for\r\nhelp and Miss Alice Stone Blackwell, the editor, and Mrs. Maud Wood\r\nPark responded. A public hearing was granted by the Senate committee\r\nand people from all over the State were present. Nine legislators and\r\nmembers of the association spoke for the bill. Not one opponent\r\nappeared. In the Senate it failed by three votes, many who were\r\npledged to it deserting.\r\n\r\n1908. Legislative committee chairman 1908-1910, Mrs. Annette W.\r\nParmelee, spoke at the hearing on the Municipal suffrage bill, which\r\nwas defeated in the Senate by 16 to 11. During the final debate Mrs.\r\nParmelee wrote down the disgusting remarks made by some of the\r\nopponents and their consternation was great when these were published.\r\nThis bill for years was termed the \"football.\"\r\n\r\n1909. The legislative chairman sent an official letter to Frank E.\r\nPartridge, chairman of the Commission to Propose Amendments to the\r\nState Constitution, which can only be done once in ten years, asking\r\nthat suffrage for women be among the proposals considered. The letter\r\nwas read May 28, 1910, before the commission--Frank L. Greene, A. M.\r\nFletcher, W. N. Cady and M. G. Leary, but received no attention.\r\n\r\n1910. The legislative chairman was assisted by Chaplain A. W. Ford. In\r\nthe official record suffrage was spelled \"sufferage.\" The Municipal\r\nsuffrage bill was introduced in the House and the suffragists asked\r\nfor a hearing but the date was changed three times and the final one\r\nleft no time for summoning speakers. At the request of Judge H. S.\r\nPeck the House resolved itself into a committee of the whole and the\r\nSenate came in. The Northfield Cadets, the Burlington High School and\r\nseveral hundred visitors attended the hearing and gave close attention\r\nto Mrs. Parmelee for an hour. A large number of members spoke for and\r\nagainst the bill. An anti-suffrage newspaper in referring to it said:\r\n\"Its killing will make a Roman holiday for ladies' week.\" It was\r\nrefused a third reading by 113 to 111. A bill permitting women to vote\r\non the liquor question aroused the stormiest debate of the session and\r\nthe Speaker split his desk trying to preserve order. It was definitely\r\nsettled that the Legislature would pass no woman suffrage bills.\r\n\r\n1912. The legislative committee was Mrs. Frances Rastall, Miss Fanny\r\nB. Fletcher, Mrs. J. B. Estee and Mrs. Parmelee and the bill was to\r\nadd the words \"and female\" in the statutes. On October 24 at a hearing\r\nheld in Representatives Hall, which was filled to overflowing, the\r\nfollowing made addresses in favor: Miss Anne Rhodes of New York; Mrs.\r\nAgnes M. Jenks of New Hampshire; Miss Mabel Foster of Washington, D.\r\nC.; Mrs. Rastall, Mrs. Charles Van Patten, Mrs. Parmelee, Senators\r\nDarling, Jose, and the Rev. Clifford Smith, superintendent of the\r\nState Anti-Saloon League. Those speaking in opposition were: Mrs. E.\r\nD. Brooks Brown, who presented an \"anti\" petition; Miss Minnie\r\nBronson, secretary of the National Anti-Suffrage Association; Mrs. M.\r\nH. Buckham, Mrs. George W. Wales, Miss Lillian Peck, Mrs. T. J.\r\nDeavitt and Senator D. C. Hawley. It was defeated as usual. A bill\r\nwhich gave women the same right as men to vote in town meetings on all\r\nmatters relating to taxation and the raising and appropriation of\r\nmoney passed the Senate but was not considered by the House.\r\n\r\n1915. Mrs. Amanda Seaver served as the \"watchman on the tower,\" her\r\nhusband being a member of the Legislature, and she was assisted by\r\nMrs. Wyman and Mrs. Taylor. A public hearing on the bill for Municipal\r\nand Presidential suffrage was held January 21. A large audience in\r\nRepresentatives Hall listened to a convincing address by Mrs.\r\nAntoinette Funk of Chicago, a member of the Congressional Committee of\r\nthe National Association. Mrs. Wyman closed the hearing with an\r\neffective speech. Opportunity was given for the opponents but although\r\na large delegation of them from Burlington was present, no one spoke.\r\nMrs. George of Massachusetts and John A. Matthews, a member of the New\r\nJersey Legislature, were the anti-suffrage speakers February 2 at a\r\nlargely attended Senate hearing. The vote in the Senate was 19 to 19;\r\nin the House the bill was loaded with amendments and a third reading\r\nwas refused by 129 to 100.\r\n\r\n1917. Dr. Grace Sherwood was legislative chairman. Six bills giving\r\nvarious kinds of suffrage to women were introduced and every trick\r\nthat legal minds could devise was employed to retard or defeat their\r\npassage but nevertheless one was passed, which was introduced by\r\nRepresentative Ernest E. Moore. It provided that \"a female citizen, 21\r\nyears of age, who has taken the Freeman's Oath ... and whose taxes\r\nwere paid prior to the 15th day of February preceding town meeting,\r\nshall while residing in such town be a voter in town meeting.\"\r\nHearings were held February 6, 15, 16 and March 17, 20. There were 28\r\nspeakers in favor, 9 of them women; 21 opposed, 9 of them women. The\r\nSpeaker, Stanley G. Allson, instead of asking the usual question\r\n\"Shall the bill pass?\" put the question \"Shall the bill be rejected?\"\r\nSeveral members were caught by the trick and voted the opposite of\r\nwhat they intended but four changed their votes--Hardy of Guildhall,\r\nHayden of Barton, Hooper of Hardwick and Bliss of Georgia, just enough\r\nto carry it. It passed the House March 9 by 104 to 100, and the Senate\r\nMarch 20 by 16 to 11. It was signed by Governor Horace F. Graham March\r\n30. Vermont thus had the honor of leading all eastern States in\r\nadopting a Town and Municipal suffrage bill permitting tax paying\r\nwomen to vote and hold office.\r\n\r\n1919. Mrs. Halsey W. Wilson, its recording secretary, was sent by the\r\nNational Association to assist the State Executive Board during the\r\nlegislative session. A bill introduced by Senator Carr of Caledonia to\r\nrepeal the Municipal suffrage act was promptly defeated. Effort was\r\nnow concentrated on the Presidential suffrage bill, which was\r\nintroduced January 14. The Senate passed it by a vote of 20 to 10 and\r\nsent it to the House, where it was first read on January 28 and\r\nreferred to the Committee on Suffrage and Elections, which reported in\r\nfavor. The bill was read the second time and several motions to defeat\r\nit were made by Representative Hopkins of Burlington but all were lost\r\nand the third reading was ordered by a vote of 129 ayes, 83 noes. At a\r\nhearing February 4 the following spoke in favor: Dr. Sherwood, Mrs.\r\nFred Blanchard, Mrs. Joanna Croft Read, Senators Steele, Vilas and M.\r\nJ. Hapgood; in opposition, Senators Carr and Felton, Miss Margaret\r\nEmerson, Mrs. Wayne Read, Mrs. H. C. Humphrey, David Conant,\r\nRepresentatives O'Dowd, Cudworth and Hopkins. On February 5 the bill\r\npassed by 120 ayes, 90 noes. Governor Percival W. Clement vetoed it in\r\nMarch on the ground of unconstitutionality, though eight Legislatures\r\nhad passed a similar bill without question and Illinois women had\r\nvoted under one in 1916.\r\n\r\nThe State suffrage convention was in session at Burlington and\r\nimmediately on its adjournment March 12 Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, the\r\nnational president, and fifteen of the delegates went to Montpelier,\r\nwhere Mrs. Catt addressed the Legislature. The Senate reconsidered the\r\nbill and passed it over the veto. On March 17 the Speaker laid before\r\nthe House an extended communication from Governor Clements giving in\r\ndetail his reasons for failing to approve the bill. It was then read\r\nand Representative Tracy moved that it be made a special order for the\r\nfollowing Thursday, which was agreed to by 104 ayes, 70 noes. At that\r\ntime the question, \"Will the House pass the bill notwithstanding the\r\nobjections of the Governor?\" was decided in the negative by 168 noes,\r\n48 ayes. The next year the women were fully enfranchised by the\r\nFederal Amendment.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[185] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Annette W.\r\nParmelee, State Superintendent of Press, State Secretary and State\r\nHistorian for the Vermont Woman Suffrage Association.\r\n\r\n[186] Among those who addressed the annual conventions during the\r\nyears were the Reverends A. M. Smith, J. A. Dixon, F. E. Adams, Verdi\r\nMack, J. Borden Estee, George B. Lamson, T. L. Massock, E. T.\r\nMatthison, E. M. H. Abbott, C. J. Staples, O. M. Owen, Eugene Haines,\r\nM. T.

Howard; Misses Mary E.\r\nPurple, Grace Robinson, Margaret Allen, Fanny Fletcher, Emilia\r\nHoughton, Eliza Eaton, Carolyn Scott.\r\n\r\n[187] This year Miss Lou J. C. Daniels, a liberal contributor to the\r\nsuffrage association, her family the largest taxpayers in Grafton,\r\nwhere they had a summer home, was indignant to learn that the\r\nRepresentative of her district had voted against the suffrage bill in\r\nthe Legislature. She sent a written protest and refusal to pay her\r\ntaxes, whereupon an official served papers on her and several shares\r\nof stock in the Bellows Falls National Bank were attached and sold at\r\nauction. The bank declared it illegal and declined to honor the sale.\r\nThe matter aroused discussion throughout the State and surrounding\r\ncountry. When the town elected a Representative who supported woman\r\nsuffrage she considered the lesson sufficient and paid her taxes.\r\n\r\n[188] Governor Clement retired from office Dec. 31, 1920, and was\r\nsucceeded by Governor James Hartness. The Legislature met in regular\r\nsession in January, 1921. The resolution to ratify the Federal\r\nSuffrage Amendment was read in the House for the third time on January\r\n28 and passed by 202 ayes, 3 noes, French, Stowell and Peake of\r\nBristol. On February 8 it passed the Senate unanimously.\r\n\r\n[189] Presidents of the State association from 1900 to 1920 not\r\nalready mentioned were Elizabeth Colley; C. D. Spencer; the Rev. A. M.\r\nSmith; Mrs. A. D. Chandler; the Hon. James Hutchinson; Mrs. Frances\r\nRastall Wyman; Dr. Grace Sherwood. Secretaries: Miss Laura Moore\r\n(1883-1905); Mrs. Fatima Davidson; the Rev. Verdi Mack; the Rev. Mary\r\nT. Whitney; Mrs. Annette W. Parmelee; Mrs. Jeannette Pease; Mrs. Annie\r\nC. Taylor; Miss Emilia Houghton; Mrs. Amanda Seaver; Miss Marguerite\r\nAllen; Miss Ann Batchelder; Mrs. James A. Merrill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA.[190]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest record of woman suffrage in Virginia bears the name of\r\nMrs. Hannah Lee Corbin of Gloucester county, whose protest in 1778\r\nagainst taxation without representation was answered by a letter from\r\nher brother, Richard Henry Lee (\"Lighthorse Harry\"), who wrote that in\r\nhis opinion under the clause in the constitution which gave the vote\r\nto householders she could exercise the suffrage.\r\n\r\nThere had been a suffrage organization in Virginia in 1893, of which\r\nMrs. Orra Langhorne, a pioneer worker, had been president. When the\r\nState Equal Suffrage League was organized, Miss Laura Clay of Kentucky\r\ngave to it a trust fund of $2.50 which had been left in the treasury\r\nand Mrs. Langhorne had requested her to give to a Virginia League when\r\none should be formed. In November, 1909, a preliminary meeting was\r\nheld to discuss organization, followed a week later by the forming of\r\nthe Equal Suffrage League of Virginia. Lila Meade (Mrs. B. B.)\r\nValentine, widely known for her public work, was elected president and\r\nserved in this capacity for the next eleven years. State and city\r\nheadquarters were opened in Richmond and remained there. Miss Mary\r\nJohnston was greatly interested and used her influence in promoting\r\nthe new organization. Miss Ellen Glasgow also was very active. The\r\nleague was organized to work for suffrage by both State and Federal\r\naction and early in its existence circulated a petition to Congress\r\nfor a Federal Amendment. In 1910 this was presented to the Virginia\r\nmembers by Mrs. Valentine and the State delegates attending the\r\nnational suffrage convention.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1911, the first public meeting ever held in Richmond in\r\nthe interest of woman suffrage was addressed by Dr. Anna Howard Shaw,\r\npresident of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, with\r\nDr. Lyon G. Tyler, president of William and Mary College, in the\r\nchair. The first State convention was held this year in Richmond with\r\ndelegates present from Norfolk, Lynchburg, Williamsburg and Highland\r\nSprings societies, and individual suffragists from Fredericksburg and\r\nCharlottesville. In 1912 the convention was held in Norfolk with\r\ndelegates from twenty-two leagues. In 1913 it met in Lynchburg and the\r\nreports showed that 2,500 new members had been added and Mrs.\r\nValentine had made 100 public speeches.\r\n\r\nAn outdoor demonstration was held in Richmond on the steps of the\r\nState Capitol, May 2, 1914, in conformity with the nation-wide request\r\nof the National Association, and the celebration was continued in the\r\nevening. The convention was held in Roanoke, where it was reported\r\nthat forty-five counties had been organized in political units and\r\nthat the _Virginia Suffrage News_, a monthly paper, was being\r\npublished at State headquarters under the management of Mrs. Alice\r\nOverbey Taylor.\r\n\r\nIn 1915 street meetings were inaugurated and held in Richmond from May\r\ntill Thanksgiving, and in Norfolk, Newport News, Portsmouth, Lynchburg\r\nand Warrenton. For the first time women appeared on the same platform\r\nwith the candidates for the Legislature and presented the claims of\r\nthe women of Virginia to become a part of the electorate. The May Day\r\ncelebration was held on the south portico of the Capitol on the\r\nafternoon of May 1, after a morning devoted to selling from street\r\nbooths copies of the _Woman's Journal_, suffrage flags, buttons and\r\npostcards. A band played and the decorations and banners in yellow and\r\nblue, the suffrage and Virginia colors, made a beautiful picture. John\r\nS. Munce of Richmond introduced the speakers, Dr. E. N. Calisch, Rabbi\r\nof Beth Ahaba Temple; Miss Joy Montgomery Higgins of Nebraska and Miss\r\nMabel Vernon of Washington, D. C. In December the convention was held\r\nin Richmond and the two hundred delegates marched to the office of the\r\nGovernor, Henry Carter Stuart, to request him to embody in his message\r\nto the General Assembly a recommendation that it submit to the voters\r\nan equal suffrage amendment to the State constitution. They were led\r\nby Mrs. Valentine and brief addresses were made by Mrs. Stephen\r\nPutney of Wytheville, Mrs. Lloyd Byars of Bristol, Mrs. John H.\r\nLewis of Lynchburg, Miss Lucy Randolph Mason of Richmond,\r\ngreat-great-granddaughter of George Mason, author of the Virginia Bill\r\nof Rights; Miss Agnes Randolph, great-great-granddaughter of Thomas\r\nJefferson, founder of the University of Virginia; Miss Mary Johnston,\r\nMrs. Sally Nelson Robins of Richmond, author; Miss Elizabeth Cooke of\r\nNorfolk, Miss Janetta FitzHugh of Fredericksburg, Mrs. Kate Langley\r\nBosher of Richmond, author; Miss Roberta Wellford of University; Mrs.\r\nGeorge Barksdale, Miss Marianne Meade and Miss Adele Clark of\r\nRichmond. He received them courteously but not seriously and paid no\r\nattention to their request. During the year organization of the State\r\ninto legislative and congressional districts was begun. Norfolk was\r\nthe place of the annual convention in 1916 when 111 leagues were\r\nreported. This was a legislative year and all efforts were\r\nconcentrated on the Assembly.[191]\r\n\r\nFrom January 29 to February 2, 1917, a very successful suffrage school\r\nwas conducted in Richmond under the auspices of the National\r\nAssociation. Later when the services of this association were offered\r\nto the Government for war work the league dedicated itself to State\r\nand country and endeavored to carry out the plans of the National\r\nBoard. The president, Mrs. Valentine, was the first person in the\r\nState, on request of the Governor, to speak in the recruiting campaign\r\nand other members also took part in it. At the annual convention held\r\nin Richmond in November a resolution not only again endorsing the\r\nFederal Suffrage Amendment but pledging members to work for it was\r\nunanimously adopted. Virginia sent the largest delegation in her\r\nhistory to the national convention in Washington in December and it\r\nwas upon the advice of the returning delegates that emphasis was laid\r\nupon enrollment of those who desired woman suffrage. Because of the\r\ninfluenza epidemic no State convention was held in 1918.\r\n\r\nThe enrollment of 32,000 men and women was accomplished in 1919, Mrs.\r\nFaith W. Morgan, a vice-president of the association, securing the\r\nlargest number of names and Miss Ellen Robinson being the first person\r\nto fill her quota. The submission by Congress of the Federal Suffrage\r\nAmendment in June of this year gave great impetus to the work. In\r\nNovember the annual convention was held in Richmond, with\r\nrepresentatives from all parts of the State. At this time there were\r\n175 suffrage centers. The members reaffirmed with enthusiasm their\r\ndetermination to carry on the fight for ratification. An important\r\nfeature of the year had been the endorsement of the amendment by the\r\nState Teachers' Association, the State Federation of Women's Clubs and\r\nthe Women's Benevolent Association of the Maccabees.[192]\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 9, 10, 1920, the State league met in convention in the hall\r\nof the House of Delegates in the Capitol for the joint purpose of\r\ncelebrating the proclamation of the Federal Suffrage Amendment and\r\nplanning for the organization of a League of Women Voters. It was an\r\noccasion never to be forgotten, with a welcome extended by Governor\r\nWestmoreland Davis, speeches by Attorney General John R. Saunders,\r\nState Superintendent of Public Instruction Harris Hart and members of\r\nthe Legislature who had made the fight for ratification. Mrs. Maud\r\nWood Park, president of the National League of Women Voters, gave an\r\ninspiring address and extensive plans for future work were made. A\r\nreception was given by the wife of the Governor assisted by the\r\nofficers of the league. On November 10, in the Senate chamber, the\r\nState League of Women Voters was organized with Mrs. Valentine\r\nhonorary chairman; Mrs. John H. Lewis honorary vice-chairman and Miss\r\nAdele Clark chairman.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. For improved conditions for women in industry,\r\nchild labor laws and all welfare legislation before the General\r\nAssembly in the past ten years individual members of the league have\r\nlabored assiduously. The league as an organization, however, has\r\nconfined itself to work for suffrage, knowing that the vote gained\r\n\"all things else would be added.\"\r\n\r\n1900. When the constitutional convention met to draft the present\r\nState constitution, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, president of the\r\nNational American Woman Suffrage Association, and a small group of\r\nVirginia and other southern women appeared before it and Mrs. Catt\r\nurged it to embody woman suffrage in the new constitution but this was\r\nnot done.\r\n\r\n1912. The first resolution proposing an amendment to the State\r\nconstitution enfranchising women was introduced in the House by Hill\r\nMontague of Richmond and the hearing granted by the committee created\r\nstatewide interest. The speakers were Mrs. Valentine, Mrs. Lewis, Miss\r\nJohnston, Mrs. Bosher, Miss Randolph, Clayton Torrence and Howard T.\r\nColvin of the State Federation of Labor, later Assistant U. S.\r\nCommissioner of Labor. The vote in the House was 12 ayes, 84 noes.\r\n\r\n1914. The resolution for a State amendment was again introduced in the\r\nHouse and a hearing granted by the Committee on Privileges and\r\nElections. Mrs. Valentine presided and introduced the following\r\nspeakers: Mrs. Desha Breckinridge of Kentucky; Mrs. Kate Waller\r\nBarrett of Alexandria, State regent of the D. A. R.; Mrs. Putney, Mrs.\r\nLewis, Mrs. Barksdale of Richmond, Miss Mason, Miss Lillie Barbour,\r\nState factory inspector, and Mr. Colvin. The vote was 13 ayes, 74\r\nnoes.\r\n\r\n1916. The resolution for a State amendment had its first public\r\nhearing before a joint committee of the House and Senate. The speakers\r\nwere Mrs. Valentine, Mrs. J. H. Whitner of Roanoke, a vice-president\r\nof the State League; Miss Eudora Ramsey and Miss Adele Clark of\r\nRichmond; the Rev. John J. Wicker, pastor of Leigh Street Baptist\r\nChurch, Richmond, and E. F. Sheffey of Lynchburg. The House vote, 40\r\nayes, 51 noes, marked the third defeat but an increase in suffrage\r\nsentiment.\r\n\r\n1918. The Legislative Committee consisted of Mrs. Valentine, Miss\r\nWellford, Mrs. Frank L. Jobson, Miss Clark, Miss Nora Houston and\r\nMrs. Munce, all of Richmond. The Federal Suffrage Amendment having now\r\npassed the Lower House of Congress, a resolution urging the U. S.\r\nSenate to take favorable action on the Federal Amendment was\r\nintroduced but it did not come out of committee. The Hon. William\r\nJennings Bryan stopped over trains to pay his respects to Governor\r\nWestmoreland Davis. He was escorted to the Capitol by members of the\r\nEqual Suffrage League and made a brief address to the Assembly in\r\njoint recess, urging ratification of the Federal Amendment if\r\nsubmitted in time for action at this session.[193]\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. The Legislature assembled August 13, 1919, in special\r\nsession for the purpose of meeting the federal appropriation for good\r\nroads. The Federal Suffrage Amendment having been submitted to the\r\nLegislatures for ratification on June 4 was due to be presented by the\r\nGovernor. As the special session had been called specifically for good\r\nroads, the State Equal Suffrage League intended to await the regular\r\nsession of 1920 to press for action but to test the legislators a\r\nquestionnaire was sent to them. Answers proved that it would be\r\nwell-nigh impossible to obtain ratification at this time, even though\r\nsubstantial petitions from all sections of the State were shown to men\r\nrepresenting the localities from which these came. Spurred on,\r\nhowever, by efforts of the National Woman's Party to secure action at\r\nany cost, the opponents succeeded in having a Rejection Resolution\r\nrailroaded through the House without debate ten minutes before\r\nadjournment in the second week of the session. The Senate refused to\r\nsanction such tactics and by 19 to 15 voted to postpone action until\r\nthe next session.\r\n\r\n1920. The State league's committee on ratification was composed of\r\nMrs. Valentine, Miss Clark, Mrs. Bosher, Mrs. Jobson, Miss Houston and\r\nMiss Mary Elizabeth Pidgeon.[194] Miss Josephine Miller, an organizer\r\nfor the National Association, was sent into the State toward the end\r\nof the campaign. There were in the two Houses 61 new members who had\r\nbeen elected since the Federal Amendment was submitted. Very strong\r\npressure to ratify was made upon the General Assembly. President\r\nWilson sent an earnest appeal and others came from Homer Cummings,\r\nchairman of the National Democratic Committee; A. Mitchell Palmer, U.\r\nS. Attorney General; Carter Glass, U. S. Treasurer; U. S.\r\nRepresentative C. C. Carlin and other prominent Democrats. Thousands\r\nof telegrams were sent from women throughout the southern States. A\r\ncablegram came from Lady Astor, M. P. of Great Britain, a Virginian.\r\nUrgent requests for ratification were made by presidents of colleges,\r\nmayors of cities, State and county officials and other eminent\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nBefore the Governor had even sent the certified copy of the amendment\r\nto the Legislature its strongest opponent, Senator Leedy, also an\r\nopponent of the administration at Washington, introduced a Rejection\r\nResolution couched in the same obnoxious terms he had used in August.\r\nBy urgent advice of the leaders he finally omitted some of its most\r\noffensive adjectives. It was presented in the House by Representative\r\nOzlin and referred to the Federal Relations Committee, which granted a\r\nhearing. On the preceding evening Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, president\r\nof the National Suffrage Association, addressed a mass meeting held by\r\nthe Equal Suffrage League in the Jefferson Hotel. The hearing was held\r\nbefore a joint session of the Senate and House in the Hall of\r\nDelegates at noon on January 21. Some of Virginia's foremost citizens\r\nspoke for ratification, among them Allan Jones, member of the State\r\nDemocratic Committee; Roswell Page, State auditor and a brother of the\r\nHon. Thomas Nelson Page; U. S. Representatives Thomas Lomax Hunter and\r\nHoward Cecil Gilmer; J. B. Saul, chairman of the Roanoke County\r\nDemocratic Committee; former Senator Keezel; Dr. Lyon G. Tyler. The\r\nwomen speakers were Mrs. Catt, Mrs. Valentine, president, and Mrs.\r\nJohn H. Lewis, vice-president of the State Suffrage League, and Mrs.\r\nKate Waller Barrett.[195]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this very able presentation the Federal Relations\r\nCommittee reported the Rejection Resolution favorably. On the floor\r\nLindsay Gordon of Louisa county substituted a Ratification Resolution\r\nand Harry Rew of Accomac a substitute to refer ratification to the\r\nvoters. The latter carried on January 27 by a vote of 55 to 39,\r\nsupported by Representatives Gordon, Willis of Roanoke, Williams of\r\nFairfax, Hunter of Stafford, Rodgers, J. W. Story, Wilcox of Richmond,\r\nSnead of Chesterfield and H. W. Anderson, Republican floor leader.\r\n\r\nThe battle front now shifted to the Senate, where, owing to illness of\r\nthe chief suffrage proponent, G. Walter Mapp, consideration had been\r\npostponed. On February 6, the day finally set, proceedings were\r\nsimilar to those in the House, Senator E. Lee Trinkle's ratification\r\nresolution and Senator Gravatt's referendum being respectively\r\nsubstituted for Leedy's rejection. The referendum, under Leedy's\r\ncoercive method, was voted down. All day the contest raged on the\r\nratification resolution, with strong speeches in favor by Senators\r\nTrinkle of Wythe, Corbitt of Portsmouth, Paul of Rockingham, Layman of\r\nCraig, West of Nansemond, Parsons of Grayson. Supporting the measure\r\nby vote were also Senators Crockett, Haslinger and Profitt; and\r\npairing in favor Pendleton and Gravatt. The Ratifying Resolution was\r\ndefeated. The Rejection Resolution was adopted by 24 to 10 votes; in\r\nthe House by 16 to 22.\r\n\r\nOne week later the resolution of Senator J. E. West to submit to the\r\nvoters a woman suffrage amendment to the State constitution passed the\r\nSenate by 28 ayes, 11 noes; the House by 67 ayes, 10 noes; as it would\r\nhave to pass the Legislature of 1921 and ratification of the Federal\r\nAmendment was almost completed, this vote was merely an empty\r\ncompliment. A few days thereafter the Qualifications Bill, offered by\r\nSenator Mapp, was overwhelmingly adopted, Senate, 30 ayes, 6 noes;\r\nHouse, 64 ayes, 17 noes. It made full provisions for the voting of\r\nwomen if the Federal Amendment should be ratified.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[190] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Edith Clark\r\nCowles, Executive and Press Secretary; Miss Adele Clark, Legislative\r\nChairman, and Miss Ida Mae Thompson, Headquarters Secretary of the\r\nState Equal Suffrage League.\r\n\r\n[191] From year to year delegates from the Equal Suffrage League went\r\nto the State political conventions, asking for an endorsement of woman\r\nsuffrage. The Republicans, the minority party, always received them\r\ncourteously and a few times put the plank in their platform. The\r\nDemocrats always treated them with discourtesy and never endorsed\r\nwoman suffrage in any way until 1920, when they \"commended the action\r\nof the General Assembly in passing the Qualifications Bill contingent\r\nupon the ratification and proclamation of the 19th Amendment.\"\r\n\r\n[192] There were very few changes in officers during the eleven years\r\nof the league's existence. The list was as follows: Honorary\r\nvice-presidents, Miss Mary Johnston, Miss Ellen Glasgow.\r\nVice-presidents: Mrs. Kate Waller Barrett, Mrs. Louise Collier\r\nWillcox, Mrs. C. V. Meredith, Mrs. T. Todd Dabney, Mrs. W. J. Adams,\r\nMrs. John H. Lewis, Miss Nannie Davis, Mrs. Stephen Putney, Mrs. Kate\r\nLangley Bosher, Mrs. J. Allen Watts, Mrs. W. T. Yancey, Mrs. C. E.\r\nTownsend, Mrs. W. W. King, Mrs. J. H. Whitner, Mrs Faith W. Morgan,\r\nMrs. Robert Barton; secretaries, Mrs. Alice M. Tyler, Miss Adele\r\nClark, Mrs. Grace H. Smithdeal, Miss Roberta Wellford, Miss Lucinda\r\nLee Terry; treasurers: Mrs. C. P. Cadot, Mrs. E. G. Kidd; auditors:\r\nMrs. John S. Munce, Mrs. Henry Aylett Sampson, Mrs. S. M. Block.\r\n\r\n[193] By act of the General Assembly of 1918 women were admitted to\r\nWilliam and Mary College. They were admitted to the graduate and\r\nprofessional schools of the University of Virginia by act of the Board\r\nof Visitors in 1920.\r\n\r\n[194] Miss Pidgeon was appointed by the National Association in\r\nNovember, 1919, for organization to prepare for ratification of the\r\nFederal Suffrage Amendment. After its defeat the next February she\r\ncontinued until June 15, organizing citizenship schools throughout the\r\nState. The expense to the association was $1,792.\r\n\r\n[195] The next day, after Mrs. Catt had returned to New York, Harry\r\nSt. George Tucker appeared before the Legislature and ridiculed her\r\nand her speech in the most insulting terms. In 1921 Mr. Tucker was a\r\ncandidate for Governor and was defeated at the primaries by Senator E.\r\nLee Trinkle, whose plurality was 40,000. He had been a strong\r\nsupporter of woman suffrage and his victory was attributed to the\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON.[196]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe period from 1900 to 1906 was one of inactivity in State suffrage\r\ncircles; then followed a vigorous continued campaign culminating in\r\nthe adoption of a constitutional amendment in 1910 granting to women\r\nfull political equality. This victory, so gratifying to the women of\r\nWashington, had also an important national aspect, as it marked the\r\nend of the dreary period of fourteen years following the Utah and\r\nIdaho amendments in 1895-6, during which no State achieved woman\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of 1897 had submitted an amendment for which a\r\nbrilliant campaign was made by the Equal Suffrage Association under\r\nthe able leadership of its president, Mrs. Homer M. Hill of Seattle,\r\nbut it was defeated at the November election of 1898. The inevitable\r\nreaction followed for some years. Three State presidents were elected,\r\nDr. Nina Jolidon Croake of Tacoma, 1900-1902, elected at the Seattle\r\nconvention; Dr. Luema Greene Johnson of Tacoma, 1902-1904, elected at\r\nthe Tacoma convention; Dr. Fannie Leake Cummings of Seattle,\r\n1904-1906, elected at a meeting in Puyallup at which only five persons\r\nwere present, the small suffrage club here being the only one\r\nsurviving in the State. Dr. Cummings, aided by Mrs. Elizabeth Palmer\r\nSpinning of Puyallup, State treasurer for many years, and Mrs. Ellen\r\nS. Leckenby of Seattle, State secretary, kept the suffrage torch from\r\nbeing extinguished. Mrs. Leckenby held office continuously throughout\r\ntwelve years.\r\n\r\nThe revival of interest plainly seen after 1906 was due to the impetus\r\ngiven through the initiative of Mrs. Emma Smith DeVoe, who with her\r\nhusband, John Henry DeVoe, had recently come from Harvey, Ills., and\r\nestablished a new home. Mrs. DeVoe was a life-long suffrage worker\r\nwho had served many years in many States with Susan B. Anthony and\r\nalso was a national organizer. She began by calling on individual\r\nsuffragists and suggesting that Washington was a hopeful State for a\r\ncampaign and aroused so much interest that in November a large and\r\nenthusiastic convention met at Seattle. Dr. Cummings presided and\r\ninspiring addresses were given by A. W. McIntyre of Everett, formerly\r\nGovernor of Colorado; Miss Ida Agnes Baker of the Bellingham State\r\nNormal School; Miss Adella M. Parker of the Seattle Broadway High\r\nSchool and Professor J. Allen Smith of the University of Washington.\r\nMrs. DeVoe was elected president.\r\n\r\nConventions were held at Seattle in 1907, 1908 and 1909, Mrs. DeVoe\r\nbeing re-elected each time. By June, 1909, there were 2,000 paid\r\nmembers of the State association and afterwards, many thousands of men\r\nand women were enrolled. The executive committee decided upon a\r\ncampaign to amend the State constitution for woman suffrage and Mrs.\r\nDeVoe was made manager and given authority to conduct it according to\r\nher own judgment. No other convention or executive committee meeting\r\nwas held, only frequent informal conferences, until after the vote was\r\ntaken on November 8, 1910. The final executive committee meeting was\r\nheld at Seattle in January, 1911, when it was voted to continue the\r\nassociation until all bills were paid and then disband. It was decided\r\nto present the large silken banner \"Votes for Women\" to the next State\r\nhaving a campaign and it went to California the following year. The\r\nunfinished business was completed by the old officers, Mrs. DeVoe,\r\nMrs. Leckenby and Dr. Eaton.[197]\r\n\r\nCAMPAIGN. After the defeat of 1898 no amendment came before the\r\nLegislature for eleven years, nor was there any legislation on woman\r\nsuffrage until a resolution to submit to the voters an amendment to\r\nthe State constitution giving full suffrage was presented to the\r\nsession of 1909. It was drafted by Senator George F. Cotterill of\r\nSeattle, a radical suffragist, after many conferences with Mrs. DeVoe,\r\nand was introduced, strangely enough, by Senator George U. Piper of\r\nSeattle, an able politician and a friend of the liquor interests, in\r\nhonor of his dead mother, who had been ardently in favor of woman\r\nsuffrage. It was presented in the House by Representative T. J. Bell\r\nof Tacoma. The State association rented a house in Olympia for\r\nheadquarters and Mrs. DeVoe spent all her time at the Capitol,\r\nassisted by many of its members, who came at different times from over\r\nthe State to interview their Representatives and Senators. The work\r\nwas conducted so skilfully and quietly that no violent opposition of\r\nmaterial strength was developed. The resolution passed the House\r\nJanuary 29 by 70 ayes, 18 noes; the Senate February 23 by 30 ayes, 9\r\nnoes, and was approved by Governor Marion E. Hay on February 25.\r\n\r\nThe interests of the amendment were materially advanced later by\r\nSenator W. H. Paulhamus, then an anti-suffragist, who \"in the interest\r\nof fair play\" gave advance information as to the exact wording and\r\nposition of the amendment on the ballot, which enabled the women to\r\nhold practice drills and to word their slogan, \"Vote for Amendment to\r\nArticle VI at the Top of the Ballot.\" The clause relating to the\r\nqualifications of voters was reproduced verbatim except for two\r\nchanges: 1. \"All persons\" was substituted for \"all male persons.\" 2.\r\nAt the end was added \"There shall be no denial of the elective\r\nfranchise at any election on account of sex.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the campaign of 1910 the State Equal Franchise Society, an\r\noffshoot from the regular organization, was formed, its members being\r\nlargely recruited from the Seattle Suffrage Club, Mrs. Harvey L.\r\nGlenn, president, with which it cooperated. Headquarters were opened\r\nin Seattle July 5, with Mrs. Homer M. Hill, president, in charge and\r\nthe organization was active during the last four months of the\r\ncampaign.[198] The Political Equality League of Spokane, Mrs. May\r\nArkwright Hutton, president, worked separately for fourteen months\r\nprior to the election, having been organized in July, 1909. The\r\ncollege women under the name of the College Suffrage League, with Miss\r\nParker as president, cooperated with the regular State association.\r\n\r\nFollowing the act of the Legislature twenty months were left to carry\r\non the campaign destined to enfranchise the 175,000 women of the\r\nState. It was a favorable year for submission, as no other important\r\npolitical issue was before them and there was a reaction against the\r\ndominance of the political \"machines.\"\r\n\r\nThe campaign was unique in its methods and was won through the\r\ntireless energy of nearly a hundred active, capable women who threw\r\nthemselves into the work. The outstanding feature of the plan adopted\r\nby the State Equal Suffrage Association under the leadership of Mrs.\r\nDeVoe, was the absence of all spectacular methods and the emphasis\r\nplaced upon personal intensive work on the part of the wives, mothers\r\nand sisters of the men who were to decide the issue at the polls. Big\r\ndemonstrations, parades and large meetings of all kinds were avoided.\r\nOnly repeated informal conferences of workers were held in different\r\nsections of the State on the call of the president. The result was\r\nthat the real strength was never revealed to the enemy. The opposition\r\nwas not antagonized and did not awake until election day, when it was\r\ntoo late. Although the women held few suffrage meetings of their own,\r\ntheir speakers and organizers constantly obtained the platform at\r\nthose of granges, farmers' unions, labor unions, churches and other\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\nEach county was canvassed as seemed most expedient by interviews,\r\nletters or return postals. Every woman personally solicited her\r\nneighbor, her doctor, her grocer, her laundrywagon driver, the postman\r\nand even the man who collected the garbage. It was essentially a\r\nwomanly campaign, emphasizing the home interests and engaging the\r\ncooperation of home makers. The association published and sold 3,000\r\ncopies of The Washington Women's Cook Book, compiled by the\r\nsuffragists and edited by Miss Linda Jennings of LaConner. Many a\r\nworker started out into the field with a package of these cook books\r\nunder her arm. In the \"suffrage department\" of the Tacoma _News_ a\r\n\"kitchen contest\" was held, in which 250-word essays on household\r\nsubjects were printed, $70 in prizes being given by the paper.\r\nSuffrage clubs gave programs on \"pure food\" and \"model menus\" were\r\nexhibited and discussed.\r\n\r\nThousands of leaflets on the results of equal suffrage in other States\r\nwere distributed and original ones printed. A leaflet by Mrs. Edith\r\nDeLong Jarmuth containing a dozen cogent reasons Why Washington Women\r\nWant the Ballot was especially effective. A monthly paper, _Votes for\r\nWomen_, was issued during the last year of the campaign with Mrs. M.\r\nT. B. Hanna publisher and editor, Misses Parker, Mary G. O'Meara, Rose\r\nGlass and others assistant editors. It carried a striking cartoon on\r\nthe front page and was full of suffrage news and arguments, even the\r\nadvertisements being written in suffrage terms.[199]\r\n\r\nState and county fairs and Chautauquas were utilized by securing a\r\nWoman's Day, with Mrs. DeVoe as president of the day. Excellent\r\nprograms were offered, prominent speakers secured and prizes given in\r\ncontests between various women's societies other than suffrage for\r\nsymbolic \"floats\" and reports of work during the year. Space was given\r\nfor a suffrage booth, from which active suffrage propaganda went on\r\nwith the sale of Votes for Women pins, pennants and the cook book and\r\nthe signing of enrollment cards. The great Alaska-Yukon-Pacific\r\nExposition of 1909 at Seattle was utilized as a medium for publicity.\r\nA permanent suffrage exhibit was maintained, open air meetings were\r\nheld and there was a special Suffrage Day, on which Judge Ben B.\r\nLindsey of Denver spoke for the amendment. The dirigible balloon, a\r\nfeature of the exposition, carried a large silken banner inscribed\r\nVotes for Women. Later a pennant with this motto was carried by a\r\nmember of the Mountaineers' Club to the summit of Mt. Rainier, near\r\nTacoma, said to be the loftiest point in the United States.[200] It\r\nwas fastened to the staff of the larger pennant \"A. Y. P.\" of the\r\nexposition and the staff was planted in the highest snows on the top\r\nof Columbia Crest, a huge white dome that rises above the crater.\r\n\r\nThe State association entertained the national suffrage convention at\r\nSeattle in 1909 and brought its guests from Spokane on a special train\r\nsecured by Mrs. DeVoe, as an effective method of advertising the cause\r\nand the convention.\r\n\r\nThe State Grange and the State Farmers' Union worked hard for the\r\namendment. State Master C. B. Kegley wrote: \"The Grange, numbering\r\n15,000, is strongly in favor of woman suffrage. In fact every\r\nsubordinate grange is an equal suffrage organization.... We have\r\nraised a fund with which to push the work.... Yours for victory.\" The\r\nState Federation of Labor, Charles R. Case, president, at its annual\r\nconvention in January, 1910, unanimously adopted with cheers a strong\r\nresolution favoring woman suffrage and urged the local unions to \"put\r\nforth their most strenuous efforts to carry the suffrage amendment ...\r\nand make it the prominent feature of their work during the coming\r\nmonths.\"\r\n\r\nPractically all the newspapers were friendly and featured the news of\r\nthe campaign; no large daily paper was opposed. S. A. Perkins,\r\npublisher of eleven newspapers in the State, gave a standing order to\r\nhis editors to support the amendment. The best publicity bureau in the\r\nState was employed and for a year its weekly news letter carried a\r\nreadable paragraph on the subject to every local paper. Besides this,\r\n\"suffrage columns\" were printed regularly; there were \"suffrage\r\npages,\" \"suffrage supplements\" and even entire \"suffrage editions\";\r\nmany effective \"cuts\" were used, and all at the expense of the\r\npublishers.\r\n\r\nThe clergy was a great power. Nearly every minister observed Mrs.\r\nDeVoe's request to preach a special woman suffrage sermon on a Sunday\r\nin February, 1910. All the Protestant church organizations were\r\nfavorable. The Methodist Ministerial Association unanimously declared\r\nfor the amendment April 11 at the request of Miss Emily Inez Denney.\r\nThe African Methodist Conference on August 10 passed a ringing\r\nresolution in favor, after addresses by Mrs. DeVoe and Miss Parker.\r\nThe Rev. Harry Ferguson, Baptist, of Hoquiam was very active. In\r\nSeattle no one spoke more frequently or convincingly than the Rev. J.\r\nD. O. Powers of the First Unitarian Church and the Rev. Sidney Strong\r\nof Queen Anne Congregational Church. Other friends were the Rev.\r\nJoseph L. Garvin of the Christian Church, the Rev. F. O. Iverson among\r\nthe Norwegians, and the Rev. Ling Hansen of the Swedish Baptist\r\nChurch. Mrs. Martha Offerdahl and Mrs. Ida M. Abelset compiled a\r\nvaluable campaign leaflet printed in Scandinavian with statements in\r\nfavor by sixteen Swedish and Norwegian ministers. The Catholic priests\r\nsaid nothing against it and left their members free to work for it if\r\nthey so desired. Among Catholic workers were the Misses Lucy and Helen\r\nKangley of Seattle, who formed a Junior Suffrage League. Father F. X.\r\nPrefontaine gave a definite statement in favor of the amendment.\r\nDistinguished persons from outside the State who spoke for it were\r\nMiss Janet Richards of Washington, D. C., the well-known lecturer;\r\nMiss Jeannette Rankin of Montana, afterwards elected to Congress; Mrs.\r\nClara Bewick Colby of Nebraska and Washington, D. C., and Mrs. Abigail\r\nScott Duniway of Oregon.\r\n\r\nNone of the officers and workers connected with the State association\r\nreceived salaries except the stenographers. For four-and-a-half years\r\nMrs. DeVoe, with rare consecration, gave her entire time without pay,\r\nsave for actual expenses, and even these were at crucial times\r\ncontributed by her husband, from whom she received constant\r\nencouragement and support. For the most part of the entire period she\r\nwas necessarily absent from home, traveling over the State, keeping in\r\nconstant personal touch with the leaders of all groups of women\r\nwhether connected with her association or not, advising and helping\r\nthem and on special days speaking on their programs. Her notable\r\ncharacteristics as a leader were that she laid personal\r\nresponsibility on each friend and worker; from the first assumed\r\nsuccess as certain and avoided arousing hostility by mixing suffrage\r\nwith politics or with other reforms. She asked the voters everywhere\r\nmerely for fair play for women and made no predictions as to what the\r\nwomen would do with the vote when obtained. It was her far-sighted\r\ngeneralship and prodigious personal work that made success possible.\r\n\r\nThe Equal Franchise Society of Seattle planned to carry suffrage into\r\norganizations already existing. It gave a series of luncheons at the\r\nNew Washington Hotel and made converts among many who could not be met\r\nin any other way and was especially helpful in reaching society and\r\nprofessional people. Its workers spoke before improvement clubs,\r\nwomen's clubs, churches, labor unions, etc. A man was employed to\r\ntravel and engage men in conversation on woman suffrage on trains,\r\nboats and in hotel lobbies and lumber camps. A good politician looked\r\nafter the water front. The Political Equality League of Spokane worked\r\nin the eastern counties and placed in the field the effective worker,\r\nMrs. Minnie J. Reynolds of Colorado.\r\n\r\nThe Franchise Department of the W. C. T. U. had done educational work\r\nfor years under the leadership of Mrs. Margaret B. Platt, State\r\npresident, and Mrs. Margaret C. Munns, State secretary, affectionately\r\nreferred to as \"the Margarets.\" Its speakers always made convincing\r\npleas for suffrage and Mrs. Munns's drills in parliamentary usage were\r\nvaluable in training the women for the campaign of 1910. Tribute must\r\nbe paid to the fine, self-sacrificing work of this organization. In a\r\nprivate conference called by Mrs. DeVoe early in the campaign, the W.\r\nC. T. U. represented by these two, an agreement was reached that, in\r\norder not to antagonize the \"whisky\" vote, the temperance women would\r\nsubmerge their hard-earned honors and let the work of their unions go\r\nunheralded. They kept the faith.\r\n\r\nA suffrage play, A Mock Legislative Session, written by Mrs. S. L. W.\r\nClark of Seattle, was given in the State House and repeated in other\r\ncities. Several hundred dollars' worth of suffrage literature was\r\nfurnished to local unions. They placarded the bill boards throughout\r\nthe State, cooperating with Dr. Fannie Leake Cummings, who managed\r\nthis enterprise, assisted by the Seattle Suffrage Club, by Mrs.\r\nGeorge A. Smith of the Alki Point Club and others who helped finance\r\nit to a cost of $535. The placard read: \"Give the Women a Square Deal.\r\nVote for the Amendment to Article VI,\" and proved to be an effective\r\nfeature.\r\n\r\nMrs. Eliza Ferry Leary, among the highest taxpayers in the State, was\r\nchosen by the National Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage as their\r\nrepresentative, but, having satisfied her sense of duty by accepting\r\nthe office, she did nothing and thus endeared herself to the active\r\ncampaigners for the vote. There were no other \"anti\" members in the\r\nState. The only meeting held was called by a brief newspaper notice at\r\nthe residence of Mrs. Leary one afternoon on the occasion of a visit\r\nby a representative, Mrs. Frances E. Bailey of Oregon, at which six\r\npersons were present--the hostess, the guest of honor, three active\r\nmembers of the suffrage association and a casual guest. No business\r\nwas transacted. With the \"antis\" should be classed the only minister\r\nwho opposed suffrage, the Rev. Mark A. Mathews of the First\r\nPresbyterian Church, the largest in Seattle. He was born in Georgia\r\nbut came to Seattle from Tennessee. His violent denunciations lent\r\nspice to the campaign by calling out cartoons and articles combating\r\nhis point of view. When suffrage was obtained he harangued the women\r\non their duty to use the vote, not forgetting to instruct them how to\r\nuse it.\r\n\r\nElection day was reported to the _Woman's Journal_ of Boston by Miss\r\nParker as follows: \"It was a great victory. The women at the polls\r\nwere wonderfully effective. Many young women, middle-aged women and\r\nwhite-haired grandmothers stood for hours handing out the little\r\nreminders. It rained--the usual gentle but very insistent kind of\r\nrain--and the men were so solicitous! They kept trying to drag us off\r\nto get our feet warm or bringing us chairs or offering to hand out our\r\nballots while we took a rest, but the women would not leave their\r\nplaces until relieved by other women, even for lunch, for fear of\r\nlosing a vote. The whole thing appealed to the men irresistibly. We\r\nare receiving praise from all quarters for the kind of campaign we\r\nmade--no personalities, no boasting of what we would do, no promises,\r\nno meddling with other issues--just 'Votes for Women' straight\r\nthrough, because it is just and reasonable and everywhere when tried\r\nhas been found expedient.\"\r\n\r\nThe amendment was adopted November 8, 1910, by the splendid majority\r\nof 22,623, nearly 2 to 1. The vote stood 52,299 ayes to 29,676 noes\r\nout of a total vote of 138,243 cast for congressmen. Every one of the\r\n39 counties and every city was carried. The large cities won in the\r\nfollowing order: Seattle and King County 12,052 to 6,695; Tacoma and\r\nPierce County, 5,552 to 3,442; Spokane and Spokane County, 5,639 to\r\n4,551. Then came Bellingham and Whatcom County, 3,520 to 1,334;\r\nEverett and Snohomish County, 3,209 to 1,294; Bremerton and Kitsap\r\nCounty, including the U. S. Navy Yard, 1,094 to 372. Kitsap was the\r\nbanner county giving the highest ratio for the amendment. This was\r\nlargely due to the remarkable house to house canvass made by Mrs.\r\nElizabeth A. Baker of Manette.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the twenty months' campaign is estimated to be $17,000,\r\nwhich includes the amounts spent by organizations and individuals. The\r\nmoney was raised in various ways and contributions ran from 25 cents\r\nup, few exceeding $100. Over $500 were subscribed by the labor unions\r\nand about $500 collected at the Granges and Farmers' Unions' suffrage\r\nmeetings. Dr. Sarah A. Kendall of Seattle collected the largest amount\r\nof any one person. About $3,000 were contributed from outside the\r\nState, chiefly from New York, Massachusetts and California. The first\r\nand largest gift which heartened the workers was $500 from Mrs. Carrie\r\nChapman Catt.[201]\r\n\r\nAfter the suffrage amendment was carried there was organized on Jan.\r\n14, 1911, the National Council of Women Voters at the home of Mr. and\r\nMrs. John Q. Mason in Tacoma. Governor James H. Brady of Idaho issued\r\na call to the Governors of the four other equal suffrage\r\nStates--Wyoming, Colorado, Utah and Washington--asking them to send\r\ndelegates to this first convention. He presided at the opening session\r\nand spoke at the evening meeting which filled the largest theater.\r\nMrs. DeVoe was elected president and was re-elected at each succeeding\r\nconvention. It was non-partisan and non-sectarian and its objects were\r\nthree-fold: 1. To educate women voters in the exercise of their\r\ncitizenship; 2. To secure legislation in equal suffrage States in the\r\ninterest of men and women, of children and the home; 3. To aid in the\r\nfurther extension of woman suffrage. As new States gained suffrage\r\nthey joined the Council.\r\n\r\nBefore Mrs. DeVoe went to the National Suffrage Convention at St.\r\nLouis in March, 1919, she was authorized by the Council to take\r\nwhatever steps were necessary to merge it in the National League of\r\nWomen Voters which was to be organized there. Mrs. Catt requested her\r\nto complete the arrangements when she returned to Washington and act\r\nas chairman until this was accomplished. On Jan. 6, 1920, the Council\r\nbecame the State League of Women Voters. Mrs. Nelle Mitchell Fick was\r\nelected temporary and later Mrs. W. S. Griswold permanent chairman.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of August 21, old and new suffrage workers joined in\r\na celebration at Seattle of the final ratification by the Legislature\r\nof Tennessee, which was attended by over two hundred women.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nElection returns furnish conclusive proof that the women of Washington\r\nuse the ballot. After 1910 the total registration of the State nearly\r\ndoubled, although men outnumber women, and the women apparently vote\r\nin the same proportion as men. A tremendous increase of interest among\r\nthem in civic, economic and political affairs followed the adoption of\r\nsuffrage and the results were evidenced by a much larger number of\r\nlaws favorably affecting the status of women and the home passed in\r\nthe ten year period following 1910 than during the previous ten year\r\nperiod. Uniform hostility to liquor, prostitution and vice has been\r\nshown; also to working conditions adversely affecting the health and\r\nmorals of women and children.\r\n\r\nThe vote of the women was the deciding factor in the Seattle recall\r\nelection of February 8, 1911, when Mayor Hiram Gill was removed\r\nbecause of vice conditions permitted to flourish under his\r\nadministration. It was acknowledged that, due to a strong combination\r\nof the vice and public utility interests of the city, he would have\r\nbeen retained but for their opposition. His re-election later by a\r\nsmall majority is explained by the fact that he begged the citizens to\r\ngive him a chance to remove the stigma from his name for the sake of\r\nhis wife and family, with whom his relations were blameless.\r\n\r\nThe State Legislative Federation, representing 140 various kinds of\r\nwomen's clubs and organizations, having a total membership of over\r\n50,000 women, has maintained headquarters at Olympia during the\r\nsessions of the Legislature in recent years, to the advantage of\r\nlegislation. The W. C. T. U. also is an active influence. Miss Lucy R.\r\nCase, as executive secretary of the Joint Legislative Committee of the\r\nState Federation of Labor, Grange, Farmers' Union and Direct\r\nLegislation League, took an important part at the elections of 1914\r\nand 1916 in defeating the reactionary measures affecting popular\r\ngovernment and labor.\r\n\r\nRepresentative Frances C. Axtell of Bellingham introduced and\r\nengineered the minimum wage law and several moral bills in cooperation\r\nwith the W. C. T. U. Representative Frances M. Haskell of Tacoma led\r\nin securing the law for equal pay for men and women teachers. Reah M.\r\nWhitehead, Justice of the Peace of King county, prepared and promoted\r\nthe law relating to unmarried mothers. The Seattle Branch of the\r\nCouncil of Women Voters established a \"quiz congress,\" which requested\r\ncandidates to attend its meetings and state their position on campaign\r\nissues and answer questions and many candidates importuned it for a\r\nchance to be heard.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. The Federal Suffrage Amendment was ratified on March 22,\r\n1920, at an extraordinary session called principally for that purpose.\r\nGovernor Louis F. Hart had been reluctant to call a special session on\r\nthe ground that, due to the unsettled condition of the country at that\r\ntime, it would afford opportunity for the introduction of a flood of\r\nradical legislation which would keep the Legislature in prolonged\r\nsession at great expense to the State. He finally yielded to the\r\npersuasion of a large number of the leading women of the State and to\r\npolitical pressure from his party in high places and called the\r\nsession, which lasted but three days and dealt only with the subjects\r\nmentioned in the call.\r\n\r\nThe occasion was most impressive. The Capitol was thronged with women\r\nwho had traveled from every corner of the State to participate in the\r\noccasion. Every available seat in the balconies of both Houses was\r\nfilled and the aisles and corridors were crowded. The hope and\r\nexpectation that at any moment the wires might flash the news that\r\nDelaware had ratified and Washington would thus be the thirty-sixth\r\nand final State to enfranchise the women of the whole nation, lent an\r\nadded thrill to the proceedings. At noon both Houses met in joint\r\nsession to listen to the Governor's message. Dealing with the\r\nratification he reminded the members that in 1910 the electors had\r\nadopted woman suffrage by an overwhelming vote and said, \"The State\r\nhas done well under the management of both men and women.\" A marked\r\nfeature of their proceedings was the gracious courtesy accorded to the\r\nold suffrage leaders and workers, who were present in large numbers.\r\n\r\nIn the House the honor of introducing the resolution was accorded to\r\nMrs. Haskell, Representative from Pierce county, who made a strong\r\nspeech favoring its adoption. Not one vote was cast against it. By\r\nspecial resolution Mrs. Emma Smith DeVoe, referred to as \"the mother\r\nof suffrage\" in the State, was invited to a seat on the right of\r\nSpeaker Adams, with Governor Hart on the left. A special committee was\r\nappointed to escort her and she took her seat amid loud cheers. She\r\nwas asked to address the House and said in part:\r\n\r\n     I am proud of the Legislature of Washington because of this\r\n     patriotic act and I thank you in the name of our forefathers, who\r\n     first proclaimed that \"taxation without representation is\r\n     tyranny\" and that government without consent is unjust.... I\r\n     thank you in the name of the early suffrage workers who have\r\n     passed on to their beautiful reward. I thank you in the name of\r\n     the women of the United States of today who will, I trust, use\r\n     their new political freedom wisely and well. I thank you in the\r\n     name of the children who will come after us; they will have a\r\n     better, broader and nobler heritage than was ours. And I\r\n     personally thank you from the depths of my heart. God bless you\r\n     every one!\r\n\r\nTwelve minutes after the resolution reached the Senate it had been\r\npassed by another unanimous vote. During the proceedings Mrs. Homer M.\r\nHill sat beside President Carlyon and was invited to address the\r\nmembers. Described as \"a tiny figure whose white hair was scarcely on\r\na level with the top of the Speaker's desk,\" she expressed the\r\nemotions of the older suffragists as they witnessed the adoption of\r\nthe resolution. She thanked them in the name also of the W. C. T. U.,\r\nand thanked the leaders in the cause of labor and of many other\r\norganizations, as well as the leaders of both parties. \"Washington has\r\nled the victorious crusade for the Pacific Coast States,\" she said.\r\n\"May we always appreciate what it means to live in a State whose men\r\nthemselves gave this right to women!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[LAWS. A complete digest of the laws relating especially to the\r\ninterests of women and children and to moral questions enacted during\r\nthe first decade of the present century was prepared for this chapter\r\nby Judge Reah M. Whitehead of Seattle. This was supplemented by an\r\nabstract of fifty-eight statutes of a similar nature enacted during\r\nthe last decade, prepared by attorneys Adella M. Parker of Seattle and\r\nBernice A. Sapp of Olympia. They largely cover the field of modern\r\nliberal legislation but can not be given because of the decision to\r\nomit the laws in all the State chapters for lack of space. The results\r\non questions related to prohibition submitted to the electors, with\r\nwomen voting, are significant: Statute for State-wide prohibition\r\nsubmitted in 1914: ayes, 189,840; noes, 171,208; statute submitted in\r\n1916 permitting hotels to sell liquor: ayes, 48,354; noes, 262,390;\r\nstatute authorizing manufacture, sale and export of 4 per cent. beer:\r\nayes, 98,843; noes, 245,399.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[196] The History is indebted for this chapter to Dr. Cora Smith King,\r\nassisted by Mrs. Emma Smith DeVoe, Dr. Sarah A.

The society employed Mrs.\r\nRose Aschermann, Mrs. Ethel Stalford, Charles E. Cline, Vaughn Ellis\r\nand John Gray of Washington.\r\n\r\n[199] During the year following the winning of the franchise Mrs.\r\nHanna published her paper under the name of _The New Citizen_. Miss\r\nParker published twelve numbers of a monthly paper called The _Western\r\nWoman Voter_, from the files of which much valuable data has been\r\ngleaned for this chapter.\r\n\r\n[200] The member was Dr. Cora Smith King.--Ed.\r\n\r\n[201] Among eastern contributors were Henry B. and Alice Stone\r\nBlackwell, Mass., $250; Mr. and Mrs. J. H. Lesser, California, $100;\r\nMrs. H. E. Flansburg, New York, $100; Miss Janet Richards, Washington,\r\nD. C., $100; the Rev. Olympia Brown, Wisconsin, $25. The National\r\nAmerican Woman Suffrage Association contributed direct to Mrs. DeVoe\r\nfor traveling expenses to June, 1909, inclusive, $900. At this time,\r\nseventeen months before the amendment was submitted, through\r\ndifferences arising between the national and State organizations, all\r\nnational support was withdrawn. Among those contributing from the East\r\nto Mrs. Hill's society through Miss Margaret W. Bayne of Kirkland, who\r\nwent there to raise money, her own trip being financed by Mrs. E. M.\r\nRininger of Seattle, were: Mrs. Henry Villard, New York, $200; Mrs.\r\nSusan Look Avery, Kentucky, $250; Mrs. Elizabeth Smith Miller and Miss\r\nAnne Fitzhugh Miller, New York, $300; Mrs. Kemeys, New York, $100;\r\nMrs. Alfred Lewis, New York, $50; Mrs. Raymond Robins, Illinois, $50;\r\nMisses Isabel and Emily Howland, New York, $20; Mrs. Sarah L.

Luscomb, Mass., $100; \"A Friend,\"\r\n$200.\r\n\r\nThe net contribution of the National to the State Association during\r\nthe campaign, deducting the expense of entertaining the 1909 national\r\nconvention, was about $30.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nWEST VIRGINIA.[202]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1895 when the West Virginia Equal Suffrage Association was\r\norganized through the effort of the National American Association,\r\nwith Mrs. Jessie G. Manley president, nine clubs were formed in the\r\nnorthern part of the State but only those in Fairmont and Wheeling\r\nremained in existence after 1900. The first president of the Fairmont\r\nClub was the mother of Mrs. Manley, Mrs. Margaret J. Grove, who with\r\nher sisters, Mrs. Corilla E. Shearer and Miss Ellen D. Harn, all still\r\nliving, aged 89, 90 and 92, led in the early suffrage work in the\r\nState, and Mrs. Mary Reed of Fairmont also was a pioneer. Little\r\npublic work was done until an active suffrage movement was inaugurated\r\nin Virginia and in 1912 Miss Mary Johnston came to Charleston and\r\norganized a club. One was formed in Morgantown and these four\r\nconstituted the State association until the amendment campaign of\r\n1916.\r\n\r\nThe following have served as State presidents: Mrs. Beulah Boyd\r\nRitchie, 1900-1903; Mrs. M. Anna Hall, 1904; Mrs. Anne M. Southern,\r\n1905; Dr. Harriet B. Jones, 1906; Mrs. May Hornbrook, 1907-1910; Mrs.\r\nAllie Haymond, 1911-1912; Miss Margaret McKinney, 1913; Mrs. J. Gale\r\nEbert, 1914-1915; Mrs. Lenna Lowe Yost, 1916; Mrs. John L. Ruhl,\r\n1917-1920.[203] Annual meetings were held as follows: 1900, December\r\n1, Fairmont; 1904, August 11, Moundsville; 1905, October 27, Fairmont;\r\n1906, October 26, Wheeling; 1907, November 8, Wheeling; 1908, October\r\n29, Fairmont; 1909, October 30, Wheeling; 1911, October 27, Fairmont;\r\n1913, October 24, Wheeling. During these years practically all that\r\nwas done was to have speakers of note from time to time and a\r\nresolution for woman suffrage introduced in the Legislature whenever\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 a new city charter was prepared for Wheeling and an effort was\r\nmade to have it provide for a municipal vote for women. Dr. Anna\r\nHoward Shaw, national president, gave a week to speaking in the city\r\nand Miss Kate Gordon, national corresponding secretary, spent three\r\nweeks there, addressing many organizations. The question was submitted\r\nto the voters with the charter but on a separate ballot. Both were\r\nlost, the suffrage amendment by 1,600. More votes were cast on it than\r\non the charter itself.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 an amendment to the State constitution permitting women to be\r\nappointed notaries public, clerks of county courts, probation officers\r\nand members of boards of State institutions went to the voters. The\r\nState Bar Association also had an amendment and kindly printed the\r\nliterature for the former and sent it out with theirs. It received the\r\nlarger number of votes--44,168 ayes, 45,044 noes--and was lost by only\r\n876.\r\n\r\nWith the submission to the voters by the Legislature of 1915 of an\r\namendment to the constitution conferring full suffrage activity was\r\nstimulated. Miss Ida Craft of New York, in cooperation with the women\r\nof Charleston, held a suffrage school there January 28-February 3 and\r\nat that time Mrs. J. E. Cannady, vice-president of its Equal Suffrage\r\nLeague, obtained permission from Governor Henry D. Hatfield to put the\r\n\"suffrage map\" in the lobby of the Capitol. Mrs. Mary E. Craigie,\r\nchairman of church work for the National Association, addressed the\r\nWoman's Club of Parkersburg April 5 and afterwards spoke in many\r\ncities and towns through arrangement by Dr. Jones, as did Mrs. Harriet\r\nTaylor Upton of Warren and Miss Elizabeth J. Hauser of Girard, Ohio.\r\nIn May Mrs. Ebert of Parkersburg, president of the State association,\r\naddressed a letter to the clergymen urging them to use as a text on\r\nMothers' Day, May 9, The Need of Mothers' Influence in the State, and\r\nDr. Jones sent a questionnaire to 150 editors, receiving answers\r\nfavoring suffrage from 53. Mrs. Desha Breckinridge, president of the\r\nKentucky Equal Suffrage Association, spent a week in the State\r\nspeaking and Miss Craft, who kept her promise to return in May,\r\norganized many new suffrage groups, as did Mrs. Wesley Martin Stoner\r\nof Washington, who campaigned principally in the mining towns. In the\r\nsummer a Men's Advisory Committee with Judge J. C. McWhorter as\r\nchairman was appointed by the State board; the State Educational\r\nAssociation in convention endorsed woman suffrage; and after an\r\naddress by Mrs. Deborah Knox Livingston of Maine, who was on a tour of\r\nthe State, the Methodist Episcopal Conference passed a favorable\r\nresolution. Later on Governor's Day at Middlebourne with thousands of\r\npeople present Mrs. Ebert spoke with Governor Hatfield, both making\r\nappeals for votes for women. At the annual Fall Festival at Huntington\r\na suffrage float designed by Mrs. E. C. Venable was in the parade. At\r\nParkersburg suffragists addressed an immense crowd at Barnum and\r\nBailey's circus.\r\n\r\nIn October the number of small subscribers was increased by \"dollar\r\nday,\" when many persons sacrificed or earned a dollar and gave it to\r\nthe association. Window displays were arranged in many cities with\r\nespecially elaborate ones in Wheeling, Parkersburg and Huntington. At\r\nthe State convention held in Huntington Nov. 16, 1915, a \"budget\" of\r\n$25,000 was authorized, $5,000 of which was quickly subscribed by the\r\ndelegates, Dr. Irene Bullard of Charleston and Mrs. Helen Brandeburg\r\nof Huntington pledging $1,000 each for their branches. Mrs. Frank\r\nRoessing of Pittsburgh, national first vice-president, who was one of\r\nthe speakers, pledged $400 for the Pennsylvania association. For the\r\nfirst time there was an automobile parade.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1916, Mrs. Ebert resigned and Mrs. Yost, first\r\nvice-president, succeeded her, soon afterwards opening headquarters in\r\nher own home in Morgantown. These demanded practically every hour of\r\nher time from 6 in the morning until 11 at night throughout the ten\r\nmonths' campaign. Because of the illness of Dr. Bullard, chairman of\r\nliterature, that department was moved to Morgantown and placed in\r\ncharge of Mrs. P. C. McBee, with Lillie Hagans assisting. About $2,000\r\nwere invested in literature. Over 200,000 congressional speeches were\r\nsent to the voters. In the last days of the campaign personal appeals\r\nwere mailed to those in half of the 55 counties and 10,000 posters\r\nwere sent out by this bureau to be used on election day. Through a\r\npublicity department opened February 25, with Frank C. Dudley at the\r\nhead, the 200 newspapers of the State were served with news bulletins.\r\nHe also edited a special edition of the Wheeling _Intelligencer_ in\r\nJune. In September the National Association sent Mrs. Rose L. Geyer of\r\nIowa, who had conducted the publicity in its campaign this year.\r\nDuring the last month bulletins were supplied to all daily papers; 110\r\nnewspapers were provided with free plate service; many anti-suffrage\r\narticles were answered; much copy was given to local newspapers about\r\npublic meetings held by the speakers and organizers; newspaper\r\nadvertisements were furnished to all rural papers the week before\r\nelection; every city organization carried a conspicuous advertisement\r\nin the daily papers; hundreds of two-page supplements were furnished\r\nthe last week. The majority of the newspapers were editorially in\r\nfavor of the amendment.\r\n\r\nIn January the State association put two organizers in the field, Miss\r\nMarie Ames and Miss Eudora Ramsey, the salary of the latter paid by\r\nthe Allegheny county suffrage society of Pennsylvania, and the\r\nNational Association placed two, Miss Lavinia Engle and Miss Katherine\r\nB. Mills. An appeal in March for more help brought Miss Hannah J.\r\nPatterson, its corresponding secretary and chairman of organization.\r\nIn making her report to the National Board on April 5 she recommended\r\nthat headquarters be established in the business district of\r\nMorgantown; additional office assistance be sent to relieve the\r\npresident; ten organizers be secured and so distributed that there\r\nwould be one in every group of five or six counties; and a\r\nrepresentative of the National Association visit the State each month\r\nin order to keep in close touch with the work. As the \"budget\" called\r\nfor $16,000 the National Board voted to give $5,000 providing the\r\nState association would raise $11,000. The headquarters were moved at\r\nonce and furnished by friends. Later when they became too small the\r\nBoard of Trade rooms were placed at the disposal of the suffragists\r\nthrough the kindness of E. M. Grant. From time to time organizers were\r\nsent to the State until there were twenty-eight and 400 organizations\r\nwere formed. To relieve the president, Miss Alice Curtis of Iowa was\r\nsent as executive secretary, remaining until the end of the campaign.\r\nMiss Patterson made three trips to the State. Mrs. Catt made one with\r\nher, meeting with the State board August 3, 4, in Clarksburg, to hold\r\na workers' conference, which considered publicity, money raising,\r\norganization and election day methods. A \"budget\" of $14,948 to cover\r\nthe last four-and-a-quarter months of the campaign was adopted.\r\n\r\nA \"flying squadron\" of prominent West Virginia men and women speakers\r\nwas sent in groups to thirty points. They were Dr. Joseph A. Bennett\r\nof Sistersville; C. Burgess Taylor of Wheeling; the Hon. Charles E.\r\nCarrigan of Moundsville; Judge McWhorter and J. M. N. Downes of\r\nBuckhannon; Howard L. Swisher of Morgantown; the Hon. Tracy L.\r\nJeffords and the Hon. B. Randolph Bias of Williamson; Mrs. Frank N.\r\nMann of Huntington; Mrs. Flora Williams of Wheeling, soloist. Mrs.\r\nPattie Ruffner Jacobs of Alabama and Mrs. Nellie McClung of Canada\r\njoined the squadron and spoke at several points. Among others of\r\ninfluence who filled many speaking engagements and met their own\r\nexpenses were Mrs. Henry M. Russell and Rabbi H. Silver of Wheeling;\r\nMilliard F. Snider and the Hon. Harvey W. Harmar of Clarksburg; Judge\r\nFrank Cox and ex-Governor Glasscock of Morgantown. Judge McWhorter\r\nmade about 25 addresses. Uncounted numbers of women throughout the\r\nState freely gave their time and work. About 1,500 meetings were\r\narranged by the headquarters staff exclusive of those in charge of\r\nlocal women. Mrs. Catt spoke to mass meetings at Clarksburg,\r\nMorgantown and Fairmont and at the hearing before the Democratic State\r\nconvention; Mrs. Antoinette Funk of Chicago before the Republican\r\nState convention. Favorable suffrage planks were placed in the\r\nplatforms of both parties and the candidates for Governor declared\r\npublicly for the amendment.\r\n\r\nDr. Shaw made thirteen addresses in cities of over 5,000 inhabitants,\r\ncontributing her services and expenses with the condition that the\r\ncollections at her meetings go into the State treasury. Miss Katharine\r\nDevereux Blake, principal of a New York City school, addressed\r\nTeachers' Institutes three weeks without charge, the State paying her\r\nexpenses. Mrs. Jacobs gave a two weeks' speaking tour and paid her\r\nown expenses. Other speakers from outside the State were Mrs. Forbes\r\nRobertson Hale, Mrs. T. T. Cotnam of Arkansas; Dr. Effie McCollum\r\nJones of Iowa; Mrs. Anna Ross Weeks and Miss Emma L. McAlarney of New\r\nYork; Mrs. Minnie Fisher Cunningham of Texas and Mrs. McClung. Dr.\r\nHarriet B. Jones spoke throughout the campaign.\r\n\r\nThe National Association paid the salary or expenses or both of the\r\noutside speakers and twenty of the organizers.[204] It paid also for\r\n200,000 Congressional speeches; circularized and sent the _Woman's\r\nJournal_ for four months to 1,600 clergymen; furnished suffrage\r\nposters and a Ford car and paid for election advertising in all the\r\nrural newspapers. It sent Mr. Heaslip, its own chairman of publicity,\r\nfor the last days of the campaign. Financial assistance came also from\r\nthe Massachusetts association. The State was left with a deficit of\r\n$3,740. During the campaign the National Association had sent in cash\r\n$5,257. Afterwards, to reduce the deficit, it sent money for the\r\nsalary of one organizer and expenses of another beside $1,000 in cash.\r\nLater the Leslie Suffrage Commission paid a bill of $540 to the\r\nPublishing Company for literature ordered from June to November by the\r\nState and $2,000 in cash which cleared up the deficit. According to\r\nthe State report the campaign cost the State organization about\r\n$9,000. It cost the National Association and Leslie Commission over\r\n$17,000.\r\n\r\nThe vote on November 7 was 63,540 in favor; 161,607 against; opposing\r\nmajority of 98,000, the largest ever given against woman suffrage.\r\nOnly two out of the fifty-five counties carried, Brooke and Hancock,\r\nindustrial districts situated in the extreme northern part of the\r\nState. Brooke county had the lowest per cent. of illiteracy--two per\r\ncent. while it was eight and three-tenths per cent. in the State at\r\nlarge. The \"wet\" vote of Wheeling, Huntington and Charleston proved a\r\ndecisive factor in defeating the amendment. Another element working\r\ntoward the suffrage defeat was the use made by the opposition of the\r\nnegro question. They told the negroes that the white women would take\r\nthe vote away from them and also establish a \"Jim-Crow\" system and\r\nthey told the white women that the negro women outnumbered them and\r\nwould get the balance of power. There is a large colored vote in the\r\nState. A really big campaign was conducted and while the size of the\r\nopposition vote was appalling, one must consider that it was the first\r\nattempt. The election methods in some places were reprehensible.\r\n\r\nThe State convention was held at Fairmont, Nov. 20, 1917, and there\r\nwas a determination to hold together for future effort. In 1918 there\r\nwas no convention, the women being absorbed in war work. By 1919\r\nanother great struggle was ahead, as it was evident that the Federal\r\nSuffrage Amendment would soon be sent to the Legislatures by Congress.\r\n\r\nFollowing the plan of the National Association Mrs. Nettie Rogers\r\nShuler, national corresponding secretary and chairman of organization,\r\nwent to Charleston on Jan. 7, 1919, to meet the State board to discuss\r\nplans for ratification. The officers present were Mrs. Ruhl,\r\npresident; Mrs. Yost, member of the National Executive Committee, and\r\nMrs. Edward S. Romine of Wheeling, chairman of the Congressional\r\nCommittee. They stated that there was little organization, no funds\r\nand that help must be given by the National Association. Mrs. Shuler\r\nremained two weeks and with these three officers and Miss Edna Annette\r\nBeveridge interviewed and polled members of the Legislature. Acting\r\nfor the association Mrs. Shuler divided the State and assigned the\r\ndistricts to three national organizers, Miss Beveridge, who remained\r\nthree-and-a-half months; Mrs. Augusta Hughston and Miss Mary Elizabeth\r\nPidgeon, six weeks each, the National Association paying salary and\r\nexpenses and furnishing literature and printed petitions to members of\r\nthe Legislature. Suffrage societies were revived, public officials,\r\neditors and ministers interviewed and much work was done.\r\n\r\nOn April 2, 3, a large and enthusiastic State convention was held in\r\nCharleston at the Kanawha Hotel. Coming directly from the convention\r\nof the National Association at St. Louis, Mrs. Catt, the president,\r\nwho had asked for a \"working\" conference with the State board, spoke\r\non the Federal Amendment at the afternoon session and to a mass\r\nmeeting in the Young Men's Christian Association Hall in the evening.\r\nShe was accompanied by Mrs. Shuler, who spoke at a dinner in the\r\nRuffner Hotel presided over by Mrs. Woodson T. Wills, vice-president\r\nof the West Virginia Federation of Women's Clubs, and addressed by\r\nprominent men and women of the State and by Miss Marjorie Shuler,\r\nnational director of field publicity, who had conducted a conference\r\nat the afternoon session.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. The Federal Amendment was submitted by Congress June 4,\r\nand the pressing work for the State association was to secure its\r\nratification by the Legislature. Mrs. Ellis A. Yost was made chairman\r\nof the Ratification Committee, whose other members were Mrs. Ruhl,\r\nMrs. Ebert, Mrs. H. D. Rummel, Miss Mary Wilson, Miss Margaret\r\nMcKinney and Mrs. Romine. An Advisory Board was formed of 150 of as\r\ninfluential men as there were in the State, judges, lawyers, bankers,\r\nofficials, presidents and professors of colleges, editors, clergymen,\r\npresidents of the State Federation of Labor and other organizations;\r\nand the most prominent women in educational, civic and club work. This\r\nlist was printed on the campaign stationery. The last of December\r\nGovernor John J. Cornwell received a letter from Mrs. Catt urging him\r\nto call a special session in January. He was known to favor\r\nratification and he had been kept informed by the members of the\r\nsuffrage association and the W. C. T. U., who had polled the\r\nlegislators and found a majority in favor.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic Governor called the Republican Legislature in special\r\nsession for Friday, February 27, 1920. President Wilson telegraphed\r\nmembers of the Senate: \"May I not urge upon you the importance to the\r\nwhole country of the prompt ratification of the suffrage amendment and\r\nexpress the hope that you will find it possible to lend your aid to\r\nthis end?\" Both the Democratic and Republican National Committees\r\njoined in urging ratification, as did the entire State delegation in\r\nCongress, who had voted for submitting the amendment. The resolution\r\nwas introduced and by the rules went over for one day. All looked\r\npromising when suddenly its advocates found themselves in a torrent of\r\nopposition, due to the injection of the fight that was being made for\r\nthe governorship and interference from outside the State. The Maryland\r\nLegislature sent a committee to urge its rejection and anti-suffrage\r\nleaders from all over the country made their appearance. The vote was\r\ntaken on Wednesday and stood 47 ayes, 40 noes in the House. The vote\r\nwas 14 to 14 in the Senate. A motion to reconsider was lost by the\r\nsame vote. In the meantime Senator Jesse A. Bloch, who was in\r\nCalifornia, telegraphed: \"Just received notice of special session. Am\r\nin favor of ratification. Please arrange a pair for me.\" This was\r\nrefused by the opponents with jeers. Secretary of State Houston G.\r\nYoung immediately got into communication with him on the long distance\r\ntelephone and he agreed to make a race across the continent for\r\nCharleston.\r\n\r\nThen came the struggle to hold the lines intact until his arrival. The\r\nsituation was most critical because a motion in the Lower House to\r\nreconsider had been laid on the table and could be called up at any\r\ntime. Many members were anxious to go home and there was difficulty in\r\nkeeping enough present at roll call to defeat hostile attacks. The tie\r\nin the Senate held fast, however, as Senator Bloch sped across the\r\ncountry. The day he reached Chicago the opposition resorted to its\r\nmost desperate expedient by producing a former Senator, A. R.\r\nMontgomery, who about eight months before had resigned his seat,\r\nsaying that he was leaving the State, and later had moved to Illinois.\r\nThere was documentary evidence that he had given up his residence. He\r\ndemanded of Governor Cornwell to return his letter of resignation. The\r\nGovernor refused and he then appeared in the Senate that afternoon and\r\noffered to vote. President Sinsel promptly ruled that he was not a\r\nmember. On an appeal from this ruling he was sustained by a tie vote\r\nand the case was referred to the Committee on Privileges and\r\nElections.\r\n\r\nWhen Senator Bloch reached Chicago he found that not only a special\r\ntrain but also an airship were awaiting him.[205] He chose the train\r\nand made the trip with a speed that was said to have broken all\r\nrecords. He arrived on March 10 and took his seat in the Senate amid\r\ncheers from crowded galleries. The corridors were thronged and even\r\nthe floor of the Senate was crowded with guests, many of them women.\r\nThen followed a most dramatic debate of several hours, as each side\r\ntried to get the advantage. Montgomery was not permitted to take his\r\nseat and at 6 o'clock in the afternoon the vote was taken--16 ayes, 13\r\nnoes, one opponent changing his vote when he saw the resolution would\r\npass.\r\n\r\nAfter the Senate vote a second was secured in the House by the\r\nopponents of the motion to reconsider, which resulted in a larger\r\nfavorable majority than the first.\r\n\r\nHarvey W. Harmer of Clarksburg, who had charge of the resolution in\r\nthe Senate and W. S. John of Morgantown in the House, deserve the\r\nwarmest gratitude of the women. It was not an ordinary vote that the\r\nmembers gave but one which stood the test for days and against the\r\nmost determined opposition. Too much praise can not be given to\r\nGovernor Cornwell for calling the special session and for unyieldingly\r\nstanding by the cause. The Democratic State chairman, C. L. Shaver,\r\nalthough unable to be present, gave splendid help. The men outside the\r\nLegislature who gave their time unstintedly, and were present,\r\ncooperating with the Ratification Committee of the Equal Suffrage\r\nAssociation, were State chairman of the Republican Committee, W. E.\r\nBaker; Secretary of State Young, former Minister to Venezuela; Elliott\r\nNorthcott, mayor of Charleston; ex-Governor A. B. White; U. S. Senator\r\nHoward Sutherland; Major John Bond; National Republican Committeeman\r\nVirgil L. Highland; Congressman M. M. Neely; Mayor Hall and Jesse B.\r\nSullivan, a prominent newspaper correspondent. The best legal and\r\neditorial assistance was given generously by the Hon. Fred O. Blue,\r\nthe Hon. Clyde B. Johnson and former U. S. Senator W. E. Chilton. Boyd\r\nJarrell, editor of the Huntington _Herald Dispatch_, was constantly on\r\nthe firing line.\r\n\r\nThe chairman of the Ratification Committee had a herculean task during\r\nthese strenuous days and after they were over a letter of appreciation\r\nof her services was sent to Mrs. Catt, the national president, which\r\nclosed: \"The opposing elements combined tended to create for Mrs.\r\nYost what at first seemed to be a situation impossible of solution,\r\nbut with rare tact and a soundness of judgment that we have seldom\r\nseen equalled her leadership has brought about a complete victory. As\r\nsupporters of suffrage we are sending you this without Mrs. Yost's\r\nknowledge and simply that at least some part of the credit due her may\r\nbe given.\" This was signed by Chas. A. Sinsel, president State Senate;\r\nGrant P. Hall, Mayor of Charleston; W. E. Chilton, former U. S.\r\nSenator; Houston C. Young, Secretary of State; Albert B. White, former\r\nGovernor; W. E. Baker, chairman Republican State Committee; J. S.\r\nDarst, Auditor of State.\r\n\r\nThe president of the State Association, Mrs. Ruhl, was present\r\nthroughout the sessions, as were members of the State committee, Mrs.\r\nEbert, Mrs. Rummel, Miss McKinney, Mrs. Romine, Mrs. Thomas Peadro,\r\nMrs. Mann, Mrs. Allie B. Haymond, Mrs. O. S. McKinney, Mrs. Kemble\r\nWhite, Mrs. William G. Brown and Mrs. Olandus West. The cost of\r\norganizers and literature in the ratification campaign to the National\r\nAssociation was about $2,300, in addition to the State association's\r\nexpenses.\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 30, 1920, the State association became the League of Women\r\nVoters and Mrs. John L. Ruhl was elected chairman.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. 1901. A bill for Presidential suffrage, drawn by\r\nGeorge E. Boyd, Sr., was introduced in the House by Henry C. Hervey\r\nand seconded by S. G. Smith of Wheeling. It was rejected by a vote of\r\n31 to 25, Speaker Wilson voting against it. The bill was introduced in\r\nthe Senate by Nelson Whittaker of Wheeling. U. S. Senator Stephen B.\r\nElkins commanded it to be tabled and this was done.\r\n\r\n1903. A bill for Presidential suffrage was defeated.\r\n\r\n1905. A resolution introduced in the Senate by Samuel Montgomery to\r\nsubmit a suffrage amendment to the State Constitution received two\r\nvotes.\r\n\r\n1907. Dr. A. J. Mitchell introduced a resolution for an amendment in\r\nthe house; Z. J. Forman in the Senate. Senator Robert Hazlett arranged\r\na legislative hearing at which every seat was occupied, with people\r\nsitting on the steps and sides of the platform and the large space in\r\nthe back part of the room filled with men standing. Dr. Harriet B.\r\nJones made a short address and was followed by Dr. Anna Howard Shaw,\r\npresident of the National Suffrage Association, in an eloquent plea.\r\nThe vote in the Senate was 10 ayes, 13 noes; in the House, 26 ayes, 48\r\nnoes.\r\n\r\n1913. A resolution to submit a State amendment was introduced in the\r\nHouse January 28 by M. K. Duty and later at his request Delegate Ellis\r\nA. Yost took charge of it. Through the generosity of the Hon. William\r\nSeymour Edwards, Miss Mary Johnston was brought to Charleston by its\r\nsuffrage association and addressed the Legislature, which assembled in\r\nthe House Chamber. She also spoke to a large audience in the Burlew\r\nTheater. The resolution came up on February 15; the hall was crowded\r\nwith interested spectators and stirring speeches were made by the\r\nmembers. On the final roll call, to the dismay of its supporters, it\r\ndid not poll the necessary two-thirds. On motion of Delegate Yost the\r\nannouncement of the vote was postponed till Monday, the 17th, and\r\nevery possible effort was made to bring in absent members but as the\r\nfinal vote was being taken it was seen that it lacked one. At the\r\nrequest of Governor Hatfield Delegate Hartley changed his vote and it\r\nwas carried by the needed 58, Speaker Taylor George voting for it. The\r\nresolution was introduced in the Senate by N. G. Keim of Elkins and\r\nsupported by able speakers but it was lost on February 20 by 14 noes,\r\n16 ayes, 20 being necessary.\r\n\r\n1915. On January 26 the resolution for a State amendment was submitted\r\nby 26 ayes, 3 noes in the Senate and 76 ayes, 8 noes in the House, to\r\nbe voted on in November, 1916.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[202] The History is indebted for this chapter to Dr. Harriet B.\r\nJones, officially identified with the movement for woman suffrage in\r\nthe State since its beginning about thirty years ago, and to Lenna\r\nLowe (Mrs. Ellis A.) Yost, chairman of the Ratification Committee;\r\nalso to the records of the National American Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n[203] Women who have been most prominent in the work not already\r\nmentioned are: Miss Jennie Wilson, Mrs. Annie C. Boyd, Mrs. Henry O.\r\nOtt, Miss Elizabeth Cummins, Miss Anne Cummins, Miss Florence Hoge,\r\nMrs. Virginia Hoge Kendall and Mrs. Edward W. Hazlett of Wheeling;\r\nMrs. I. N. Smith, Mrs. Harold Ritz and Mrs. A. M. Finney of\r\nCharleston; Miss Harriet Schroeder of Grafton.\r\n\r\n[204] The organizers, who often were speakers also, not elsewhere\r\nmentioned, were Misses Adella Potter, Eleanor Furman, Alice Riggs\r\nHunt, Lola Walker, Josephine Casey, Lola Trax, Grace Cole, Eleanor\r\nRaoul, Mrs. C. E. Martin, Mrs. W. J. Cambron, Mrs. Elizabeth Sullivan,\r\nDr. Harriet B. Dilla and others. Miss Ramsey and Miss Raoul gave the\r\nuse of their cars. Miss Gertrude Watkins and Miss Gertrude Miller of\r\nArkansas donated their services from July 17, the State paying their\r\nexpenses. The Philadelphia County Society sent Miss Mabel Dorr for\r\ntwo-and-a-half months as its contribution. Miss Alma B. Sasse of\r\nMissouri gave her services for over two months, the State paying her\r\nexpenses.\r\n\r\n[205] It was kept a secret at the time who was responsible for this\r\narrangement but later it was found to be Captain Victor Heinze of\r\nCincinnati, who had charge of the National Republican headquarters in\r\nChicago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nWISCONSIN.[206]\r\n\r\n\r\nWoman suffrage history in Wisconsin from 1900 to 1920 naturally\r\ndivides itself into three sections, the first including the ten years\r\npreceding the submission of the referendum measure by the Legislature\r\nin 1911; the second the two years of the referendum campaign and the\r\nthird the succeeding seven years to 1920.\r\n\r\nThe work of the State Woman Suffrage Association, which was organized\r\nin 1869, continued in the 20th century, as in the 19th, through\r\norganization, public meetings, annual conventions, the publication of\r\nthe _Wisconsin Citizen_. The conventions of the first decade, which\r\nalways took place in the autumn, were held as follows: 1901, Brodhead;\r\n1902, Madison; 1903, Platteville; 1904, Janesville; 1905, Milwaukee;\r\n1906, 1907, 1908, 1909, 1910, Madison; 1911, Racine. The Rev. Olympia\r\nBrown, who had been elected president in 1883, continued to serve in\r\nthat capacity with undiminished vigor and ability, having been elected\r\nevery year, until the end of 1912. Besides her other services she gave\r\nhundreds of addresses on woman suffrage, speaking in nearly every city\r\nin the State.[207]\r\n\r\nThe publication of the _Wisconsin Citizen_, established in 1887, was\r\ncontinued in spite of limited finances. Its first editor was Martha\r\nParker Dingee from Boston, a niece of Theodore Parker, who gave her\r\nservices for seven years. After that the editors were Mrs. Helen H.\r\nCharlton, Miss Lena V. Newman and Mrs. Youmans. After 1914 it was\r\npublished at Waukesha, before that at Brodhead, and was discontinued\r\nin 1917. Notable speakers from outside the State at conventions of the\r\nfirst decade were Mrs. Catharine Waugh McCulloch, the Rev. Florence\r\nBuck, the Rev. Marion Murdock, Mrs. Clara Bewick Colby, Mrs. Belva A.\r\nLockwood, Miss Jane Addams and Dr. Julia Holmes Smith.\r\n\r\nThe association for some time supported a State organizer, the Rev.\r\nAlice Ball Loomis, and later Mrs. Emma Smith DeVoe for two seasons. In\r\n1902 headquarters were established at Madison, the capital, in a\r\nlittle room in the State House, for the distribution of literature,\r\nand here was kept a register of men and women who believed in woman\r\nsuffrage. In 1907 the Rev. Mrs. Brown prepared a bulletin for the\r\nlegislators, giving the statistics of woman suffrage in the United\r\nStates and other countries.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 Mrs. Maud Wood Park came to Wisconsin and spoke to women\r\nstudents of five colleges, arrangements having been previously made by\r\nMrs. Brown, who took part in some of the meetings, and College Women's\r\nSuffrage Leagues were organized. Mrs. Brown prepared a pamphlet, Why\r\nthe Church Should Demand the Ballot for Women, which was widely\r\ndistributed. Near the end of 1909 the State association was asked to\r\ncirculate the national petition to Congress for the Federal Suffrage\r\nAmendment. Blanks were sent all over the State to schools, libraries\r\nand other public institutions and to individuals. The members took up\r\nthe matter with enthusiasm and worked faithfully. The association did\r\nall that could be done in the six weeks allowed and about 18,000 names\r\nwere signed, 5,000 of them in Racine. Mrs. Wentworth, over eighty\r\nyears of age, canvassed portions of the city and obtained 1,000 names.\r\n\r\nDuring this whole decade resolutions and petitions were sent to\r\nCongress and at every session of the Legislature suffrage measures\r\nwere introduced. Mrs. Jessie M. Luther was chairman of the Legislative\r\nCommittee during this period, an unrecognized and unpaid lobbyist, but\r\nby her skilful work, in which at times she was assisted by Mrs. Nellie\r\nDonaldson and others, she kept the Legislature in advance of the\r\npeople of the State.\r\n\r\nIn 1911 the Legislature submitted to the voters a statutory law giving\r\nfull suffrage to women, as it had authority to do. Influences from\r\noutside the State led to the organization of the Political Equality\r\nLeague, of which Miss Ada L. James was president and Mrs. Crystal\r\nEastman Benedict from New York was made campaign manager. The campaign\r\nof 1911-1912, therefore, was carried on by two organizations, the\r\nState association and this league, working separately, although effort\r\nwas made to correlate their activities by forming a cooperative\r\ncommittee representing both societies, of which Miss Gwendolen Brown\r\nWillis was chairman. The National American Woman Suffrage Association,\r\nthrough its president, Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, contributed $100 per\r\nmonth salary for an organizer and speaker, Miss Harriet Grim, and gave\r\nfurther assistance to both organizations.[208]\r\n\r\nBoth associations employed field organizers, arranged meetings,\r\nprovided speakers, distributed literature and made active effort to\r\ninterest as far as possible organizations and individuals in the\r\ncause. The State association had headquarters in the Majestic Building\r\nand later in the Goldsmith Building in Milwaukee. The League had\r\noffices first in the Wells Building and later in the Colby-Abbott\r\nBuilding in that city. A bulletin of suffrage news was sent each week\r\nto the 600 newspapers in the State by Mrs. Youmans, who was press\r\nmanager.\r\n\r\nThe campaign opened with a big rally in Racine June 1, 1912. The Rev.\r\nOlympia Brown, State president, continued her speaking tours without\r\ncessation and was assisted by prominent outside speakers, including\r\nMrs. May Wright Sewall, Mrs. Colby, Dr. and Mrs. William Funck of\r\nBaltimore, Mrs. Rachel Foster Avery and Mrs. Clara V. Laddey, who\r\naddressed the Germans. Miss Willis arranged a course of lectures in\r\nMilwaukee for Miss Jane Addams, Louis F. Post, Dr. Sophonisba\r\nBreckinridge of Chicago University, and Mrs. Catherine Waugh\r\nMcCulloch.[209]\r\n\r\nThe Political Equality League believed enthusiastically in street\r\nmeetings and arranged many of them in Milwaukee and other cities.\r\nUnder the same auspices several automobile tours swept the State, one\r\nof them having an itinerary through the southwestern counties, Miss\r\nJames, Mrs. B. C. Gudden, Miss Grim and Miss Mabel Judd the speakers.\r\nThe noted air pilot, Beachy, scattered suffrage fliers from the\r\nairship which he took up into the clouds at the State Fair in\r\nMilwaukee. The State association had a large tent on the grounds, in\r\nfront of which there were a platform for speakers, where addresses\r\nwere made every day, and a counter covered with literature and books.\r\nThe two societies conducted Votes for Women tours up the Wolf and Fox\r\nRivers, which were important features of the campaign. They traveled\r\nin a little steamer, stopping at landings and speaking and giving out\r\nliterature. The association also held outdoor meetings at lunchtime\r\nbefore the factories and wherever it seemed best. The league formed\r\ntwo allied societies, the Men's League for Woman Suffrage, of which\r\nthe late H. A. J. Upham was president, and a league for colored\r\npeople, Miss Carrie Horton, president.\r\n\r\nAn extended series of mass meetings was held in many cities addressed\r\nby prominent speakers, who came from outside the State to assist,\r\namong whom were Mrs. Elizabeth Lowe Watson, Miss Addams, Mrs. Beatrice\r\nForbes Robertson, Mrs. Emily Montague Bishop, Professor Charles\r\nZueblin, Max Eastman, Mrs. Rachel Foster Avery; the Countess of\r\nWarwick and Miss Sylvia Pankhurst of England; Miss Inez Milholland,\r\nMrs. Maud C. Nathan, Mrs. Glendower Evans, Baroness von Suttner\r\n(Austria), Mrs. Alice Duer Miller, Mrs. Florence Kelley, Rabbi Emil\r\nHirschberg, Mrs. Grace Wilbur Trout, Mrs. Henrietta C. Lyman, Mrs.\r\nElla S. Stewart, Dr. Anna E. Blount, the Rev. Anna Garlin Spencer,\r\nMrs. Clara Neymann, who addressed the Germans, and Dr. Shaw.\r\n\r\nThere is no adequate record of that campaign in existence. Mrs. Luther\r\nwas State historian and in the habit of keeping carefully all\r\nprograms, calls for meetings, reports and other material necessary for\r\nhistory, which were preserved at the Capitol and were destroyed when\r\nit was burned. The Political Equality League raised and expended\r\n$10,000 and the State association $5,000, as reported to the Secretary\r\nof State. Nearly as much more was expended by individual members and\r\nby other organizations. Dr. Shaw and Mrs. Benedict arranged a mass\r\nmeeting in New York which netted $2,700.\r\n\r\nThe determined hostility of the liquor interests to woman suffrage was\r\nunmistakably shown during the campaign by the official organ of the\r\nState Retail Liquor Dealers' Protective Association, called\r\n\"Progress.\" For months preceding the election it was filled with\r\nobjections, innuendo and abuse in prose, verse and pictures, all\r\ndesigned to impress the reader with the absurdity and danger of giving\r\nthe vote to women. It appealed to the farmers and to every class of\r\npeople connected in any way with the manufacture and sale of beer,\r\nsaying in headlines: \"Give the Ballot to Woman and Industry goes to\r\nSmash.\" \"It means the Loss of Vast Sums to Manufacturer, Dealer and\r\nWorkingmen,\" and this was kept up to the end.\r\n\r\nAn unprecedented vote was cast on the woman suffrage proposition at\r\nthe election November 4, 1912: for, 135,736; against, 227,054; lost by\r\n91,318. Each of the three constitutional amendments voted on at the\r\ntime received barely a fifth of the vote cast on this measure. Of the\r\n71 counties but 14 were carried for suffrage, Douglas county in the\r\nextreme northwest on Lake Superior had the best record, a majority of\r\n1,000. Milwaukee county, including the city, gave 20,445 votes for and\r\n40,029 votes against. The referendum was placed on a pink ballot, used\r\nonly for this purpose, which unquestionably increased the majority\r\nagainst it, as even the most illiterate could stamp it with a \"no.\"\r\nThe defeat was conceded to have been due to an insufficiency of\r\ngeneral education on woman suffrage and of organization, the large\r\nforeign population and the widespread belief that it would help\r\nlargely to bring prohibition.\r\n\r\nThree days after the election officers of the Political Equality\r\nLeague sent to officers of the State association a letter proposing a\r\nunion of the two under a new name and on condition that the president\r\nof neither should be made president of the new one. The latter was in\r\nfavor of the union but insisted that the old historic name, Wisconsin\r\nSuffrage Association, should be retained, which was done. Miss Lutie\r\nE. Stearns was chosen its president at its annual convention to serve\r\nuntil the union was effected. There were ultimatums and\r\ncounter-ultimatums and finally a call for a joint convention to be\r\nheld in Madison Feb. 4, 5, 1913, was issued by Miss Zona Gale,\r\nvice-president of the association, and Miss James, president of the\r\nLeague. Here the union was duly effected; the Rev. Olympia Brown was\r\nelected honorary president, Mrs. Henry M. Youmans president and the\r\nother officers were divided between the two societies.\r\n\r\nThe suffrage work henceforth was conducted under the same president\r\nand the same policy. The first year of the new régime, the\r\norganization had no headquarters and paid no salaries, the officers\r\ndoing their correspondence with their own hands. The next year an\r\noffice was opened in Madison and Miss Alice Curtis was installed as\r\nexecutive secretary. It was difficult to do effective work so far away\r\nfrom the president and the office was removed to Waukesha, her\r\nresidence, with Miss Curtis and later Mrs. Helen Haight in charge. In\r\nOctober, 1916, it was removed to Milwaukee, and, with the county\r\nassociation, headquarters were opened at 428 Jefferson Street, where\r\nthey remained, with Mrs. Ruth Hamilton as office secretary.[210]\r\n\r\nThe great increase of sentiment favorable to woman suffrage throughout\r\nthe country was plainly seen in Wisconsin and it was evident that a\r\nwide campaign of education must be undertaken. A \"suffrage school\"\r\nheld in Madison in June, 1914, was very successful. Sixty-six women\r\nenrolled for the full course and hundreds of men and women attended\r\nthe special lectures. The \"faculty\" of the school included the Chief\r\nJustice of the Supreme Court, members of the faculty of the State\r\nUniversity and other well known men and women. Social Forces, a\r\ntopical outline with bibliography, published this year by the\r\nEducation Committee, Mrs. A. S. Quackenbush, chairman, was especially\r\ndesigned for the instruction of women, first, in existing conditions,\r\nand second, in the various movements made to improve them. Copies were\r\npurchased by universities, organizations and individuals all over the\r\nUnited States. Wisconsin Legislators and the Home was a valuable\r\npamphlet compiled by Miss James following the legislative session of\r\n1913, giving the records of all members on the bills of especial\r\ninterest to women which came up that year. Wisconsin Legislation,\r\nTopics for Discussion, was prepared in 1915 by Mrs. J. W. McMullein\r\nTurner for the use of the legislative and educational committees.\r\n\r\nMiss James served as legislative chairman in 1913; Mrs. Ben Hooper in\r\n1915; Mrs. Joseph Jastrow in 1917; Mrs. Hooper again in 1919. She was\r\nalso for several years congressional chairman. Regular press service\r\nwas continued during the last decade, a weekly letter being sent to\r\n100 newspapers. Mrs. Youmans had charge of all publicity during her\r\npresidency. Mrs. Gudden supplied suffrage letters regularly to several\r\nGerman papers and due to her ability they were always published.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1916, a Congressional Conference was held in Milwaukee with\r\nMrs. Catt, the national president, as the chief speaker. In June at\r\nthe time of the Republican National Convention in Chicago the\r\nassociation sent to the great suffrage parade an impressive\r\ncontingent, accompanied by a G. A. R. drum corps. This year it gave\r\n$500 to the Iowa campaign and among its members who assisted there and\r\nin campaigns in other States were Mrs. Hooper, Mrs. Haight, Miss\r\nCurtis, Mrs. Maud McCreery, Miss Edna Wright and Mrs. Youmans.\r\n\r\nOn Oct. 14, 1917, a branch of the National Woman's Party was formed in\r\nthe home of Mrs. Victor Berger and became active. There were two\r\nanti-suffrage societies of women, one in Milwaukee and one in Madison,\r\nand together they formed a so-called State association, of which Mrs.\r\nC. E. Estabrook was president and Mrs. Francis Day an active member.\r\nThey provided speakers for legislative hearings and signed their names\r\nto newspaper articles sent them from the East but were of slight\r\nimportance. The State petition work was stopped by the epidemic of\r\ninfluenza in the autumn of 1918 and after the first of the next year\r\nthe apparent favorable attitude of the Legislature made it\r\nunnecessary, but already in forty counties the names of 5,800 men and\r\n20,000 women had been obtained. Self-denial Day was originated by Miss\r\nHarriet Bain of Wisconsin and adopted by the National Association. The\r\nfund in this State was over $400.\r\n\r\nThe State association was prompt to organize for war work and formed\r\nall the committees recommended by the National American Suffrage\r\nAssociation. Many suffrage leaders served as leaders of the war work\r\nin their communities. The president was on the Woman's Committee of\r\nthe State Council of Defense and State chairman for Americanization.\r\nThe association sent $1,590 for the Oversea Hospitals financed by the\r\nNational Association.\r\n\r\nThe relations of the State with the National Association have been\r\nvery cordial. It has sent a large delegation to each of the national\r\nconventions and paid its quota for the support of national work, about\r\n$1,500 in 1919.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1919, the Legislature gave Presidential suffrage to women\r\nand the submission of the Federal Amendment was near at hand. The last\r\nmeeting of the State association, a Good Citizenship convention, was\r\nheld in Milwaukee Oct. 29-Nov. 1. The program was devoted to the\r\nintelligent and patriotic use of the ballot. Mrs. Nancy M. Schoonmaker\r\ncame from Connecticut to give six lectures on Citizenship for Women. A\r\nplan was adopted for publishing a Citizenship Manual and engaging a\r\ntraveling representative to teach good citizenship to groups of women\r\nthroughout the State. The convention provided that the association\r\nshould automatically cease to exist as soon as the Federal Amendment\r\nwas ratified, in any case not later than March 1, 1920, and should be\r\nreplaced by a State League of Women Voters. This took place on\r\nFebruary 20 and Mrs. Ben Hooper was elected chairman.[211]\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION. 1901. Provision was made for separate ballot boxes\r\nfor women, making fully operative the School Suffrage Law of 1885.\r\n\r\n1903. A Municipal suffrage bill received a small vote. A full suffrage\r\nmeasure introduced in the Assembly by David Evans was lost by only one\r\nand had a large vote in the Senate.\r\n\r\n1905. A Municipal suffrage bill was passed by the Assembly; not acted\r\nupon by the Senate.\r\n\r\n1909. A bill for a referendum to the voters passed in the Senate;\r\ndefeated in the Assembly by a vote of 53 to 34.\r\n\r\n1911. The session opened promisingly. David G. James introduced in the\r\nSenate and J. H. Kamper in the Assembly a measure providing full\r\nsuffrage for Wisconsin women contingent upon the approval of a\r\nmajority of the voters at the general election in November, 1912. Miss\r\nMary Swain Wagner was the only registered lobbyist but other\r\nsuffragists, notably Miss James, Mrs. George W. Peckham, Mrs. Nellie\r\nDonaldson and Mrs. Luther, worked for the measure. At a joint hearing\r\nthirteen speakers, including several from outside the State, spoke in\r\nfavor of the bill and one lone Assemblyman, Carl Dorner, spoke in\r\nopposition. It passed the Senate March 31 by a vote of 16 to 4, and\r\nthe Assembly April 26 by a vote of 69 to 29, and was signed by\r\nGovernor Francis E. McGovern on the ground that it was a problem which\r\nshould be solved by the voters. This measure was not, as generally\r\nassumed, an amendment to the constitution but was a law, the\r\nconstitution providing that suffrage might be extended by statute but\r\nthis must be ratified by a majority of the voters at a general\r\nelection. It was defeated in 1912.\r\n\r\n1913. Paradoxical as it may seem, legislators now became more\r\nfriendly. The Legislature of 1913 passed by a large majority in both\r\nHouses another referendum bill introduced by Senator Robert Glenn but\r\nit was vetoed by Governor McGovern on the ground that the voters\r\nshould not be asked so soon to pass upon a measure which they had just\r\ndefeated.\r\n\r\n1915. Three measures were introduced in 1915, one by Senator Glenn and\r\nAssemblyman W. C. Bradley, providing for full suffrage by State-wide\r\nreferendum; one by Senator George E. Scott and Assemblyman H. M.\r\nLaursen, providing for Presidential suffrage by action of the\r\nLegislature, and one by Senator A. Pearce Tompkins and Assemblyman\r\nAxel Johnson to permit to counties local option in the matter of\r\nenfranchising their women. Only the first was seriously considered and\r\nthis was defeated in the Assembly by a vote of 49 to 41. A\r\nrepresentative of the German-American Alliance appeared against it at\r\nthe hearing and at several later sessions.\r\n\r\n1917. A referendum measure was introduced by Senator George B. Skogmo\r\nand Assemblyman James Hanson and was killed in the Assembly by a vote\r\nof 47 to 40.\r\n\r\n1918. Meanwhile the tide was perceptibly turning and at the State\r\npolitical conventions held in September, 1918, all parties adopted\r\nplanks favoring the enfranchisement of women. What was known as \"the\r\nwoman suffrage session\" followed.\r\n\r\n1919. Resolution urging the U. S. Senate to submit a Federal Suffrage\r\nAmendment: Assembly 75 for, 14 against; Senate 23 for, 4 against.\r\nPresidential suffrage bill granting to women the right to vote for\r\npresidential electors: Assembly 80 for, 8 against; Senate 25 for, one\r\nagainst. Law extending the right of suffrage to women subject to a\r\nreferendum, passed without an aye and no vote in both Houses. It was\r\nrepealed after ratification of the Federal Amendment made it\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. The Federal Suffrage Amendment was submitted by Congress\r\non June 4, 1919. The Wisconsin Legislature ratified it about 11\r\no'clock in the morning on June 10, with one negative vote in the\r\nSenate, two in the House. A special messenger, former Senator David G.\r\nJames (the father of Ada L. James), started for Washington on the\r\nfirst train carrying the certificate from the Governor and he brought\r\nback a statement from J. A. Tonner, Chief of the Bureau of Rolls and\r\nLibrary, Department of State, that \"the certified copy of the\r\nratification resolution by the Legislature of Wisconsin is the first\r\nwhich has been received.\" The Illinois Legislature ratified an hour\r\nearlier but owing to a technical error it had to ratify a second time.\r\nThe two U. S. Senators LaFollette and Lenroot and eight of the eleven\r\nRepresentatives from Wisconsin voted for the Federal Amendment on its\r\nfinal passage through Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[206] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Theodora W.\r\nYoumans, president of the State Woman Suffrage Association from 1913\r\nuntil its work was finished in 1920.\r\n\r\n[207] The following were the officers for the first twelve years:\r\nVice-presidents: Mrs. Jessie M. Luther, Mrs. Madge Waters, Mrs. Laura\r\nJames, Vida James, Mrs. E. C. Priddle, Miss Linda Rhodes;\r\ncorresponding secretaries: Miss Lucinda Lake, Mrs. Margaret Geddes,\r\nMrs. Emma Geddes, Miss Lena Newman, Mrs. B. Ostrander, Mrs. Nellie K.\r\nDonaldson; recording secretaries: Miss Marion W. Hamilton, Miss Emma\r\nGraham, Mrs. Ethel Irish, Miss W. von Bruenchenhein; treasurers: Mrs.\r\nDora Putnam, Mrs. Lydia Woodward, Mrs. F. H. Derrick, Mrs. A. B.\r\nSprague, Mrs. B. Ostrander, Gwendolen Brown Willis; chairmen Executive\r\nCommittee: Ellen A. Rose, Mrs. Etta Gardner, Mrs. Kate Rindlaub.\r\n\r\n[208] Near the end of the campaign Miss Mary Swain Wagner from New\r\nYork organized the American Suffragettes, a short-lived society, with\r\nMiss Martha Heide as president, and it arranged a mass meeting in\r\nMilwaukee with Mrs. Emmeline Pankhurst of England as the principal\r\nspeaker.\r\n\r\n[209] A unique automobile tour was made by Mrs. McCulloch and her\r\nhusband, Frank McCulloch, both prominent lawyers in Chicago, and their\r\nfour children, who devoted their annual vacation in the summer of 1912\r\nto a tour through Wisconsin, the eldest son driving a big car, Mr. and\r\nMrs. McCulloch making suffrage speeches at designated points and the\r\nthree younger children enjoying the outing.\r\n\r\n[210] After 1913 annual conventions were held as follows: 1914,\r\nMilwaukee, speakers at evening meeting, Mrs. Pethick Lawrence of\r\nEngland and Rosika Schwimmer of Hungary; 1915, Milwaukee; 1916\r\n(postponed to January, 1917, at the time of the legislative session),\r\nMadison; 1917, Milwaukee, Mrs. Nellie McClung of Canada speaker; 1918,\r\nno convention because of the war.\r\n\r\n[211] The officials from 1913, not already mentioned, were as follows:\r\nVice-presidents: Miss Zona Gale, Dr. Jean M. Cooke, Mrs. Wm. Preston\r\nLeek, Mrs. Victor Berger, Mrs. Isaac Witter, Mrs. Frank Thanhouser,\r\nMiss Harriet F. Bain; corresponding secretaries: Mrs. W. M. Waters,\r\nMrs. Joseph Jastrow, Mrs. James L. Foley, Mrs. Glen Turner, Mrs.\r\nCharles H. Mott, Mrs. H. F. Shadbolt; recording secretaries: Mrs. H.\r\nM. Holton, Mrs. A. J.

Schorger,\r\nMrs. H. A. J. Upham, Mrs. Sarah H. Van Dusen. Mrs. A. J. Birkhauser.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nWYOMING.[212]\r\n\r\n\r\nWyoming was the pioneer Territory and the pioneer State to give full\r\nsuffrage to women. It is an interesting fact that the women did not\r\nfind it necessary to have a Territorial or State Suffrage Association,\r\nor even a convention except the one during the campaign for Statehood\r\nin 1889-90. This rare situation is explained by the fact that\r\nuniversal suffrage came to the women in the newly organized Territory\r\nin 1869 without any general demand for it but through the efforts of a\r\nvery few progressive men and women. [History of Woman Suffrage, Volume\r\nIV, page 994.] When the Constitutional Convention was preparing for\r\nStatehood in 1889, holding its sessions in Cheyenne, the women of the\r\nTerritory held a convention there in order to pass resolutions asking\r\nthat the constitution should contain an article granting to the women\r\na continuation of the right of suffrage which they had possessed for\r\ntwenty years. This was granted and both men and women voted on the\r\nconstitution, which was adopted by a three-fourths majority of the\r\nvotes cast. The fact that there was no women's association for\r\nsuffrage or for political purposes was at times a serious handicap to\r\nwomen of other States, who were not able to appeal to an organized\r\nbody for an endorsement of woman suffrage or related subjects.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 and at subsequent dates by joint resolution of both Houses of\r\nthe Legislature a strong appeal was sent to Congress to submit the\r\nFederal Suffrage Amendment. On Feb. 14, 1919, a joint resolution was\r\npassed and signed by Governor Robert D. Carey commemorating the\r\ngranting of woman suffrage in Wyoming, Dec. 10, 1869, by making this\r\ndate each year Wyoming Day, \"to be observed by appropriate exercises\r\ncommemorative of the history of the Commonwealth and the lives and\r\nwork of its pioneers.\"\r\n\r\nAt a State convention in Laramie Nov. 9-11, 1919, with Mrs. Carrie\r\nChapman Catt, the national president, as guest of honor, a branch of\r\nthe National League of Women Voters was organized, with Mrs. Cyrus\r\nBeard as State chairman. At Casper, Oct. 2, 1920, it was re-organized\r\nby Mrs. James Paige, regional director, with Mrs. C. W. Crouter as\r\nState chairman.\r\n\r\nRATIFICATION. Governor Robert D. Carey called a special session of the\r\nLegislature for Jan. 26, 1920, to ratify the Federal Suffrage\r\nAmendment. The vote was unanimous in each House, and, after it was\r\nfinished and had received the Governor's signature, Mrs. Theresa\r\nJenkins of Cheyenne, a faithful supporter of woman suffrage in Wyoming\r\nfor fifty years, thanked the members and the Governor for their action\r\nin behalf of the women of the State, the United States and the world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe decree that laws must be omitted for lack of space bars out the\r\nmany statutes in the interests of women and children which are\r\nWyoming's especial pride.\r\n\r\nThe pioneer member of the Legislature was Mrs. Mary Godat Bellamy of\r\nLaramie, elected to the Lower House in 1911. She had been a teacher in\r\nthe public schools of the city and county superintendent. She was very\r\nactive in her duties and was instrumental in having a number of\r\nexcellent bills become laws. Among these were bills for an adequate\r\nappropriation to employ a State humane officer for child and animal\r\nprotection; to establish an industrial institution for male convicts\r\ntwenty-five years old or under, as at that time 85 per cent. of those\r\nin the penitentiary were under twenty-one; an eight-hour day for women\r\nand children who worked in factories, laundries and industrial places;\r\na grant to the State University of a permanent annual revenue. She\r\nhelped to kill a bill to repeal an existing law which prohibited\r\nliquor being sold in places that were not incorporated, as mining and\r\nlumber camps. Mrs. Bellamy said later: \"While the men were courteous\r\nyet no woman must expect that when it comes to gaining a point a man\r\nis going to make an exception because his colleague is a woman.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Legislature of 1913 two women Representatives had seats--Mrs.\r\nAnna Miller of Laramie, a mother of six grown children, three of whom\r\nwere graduated from the State University, and Miss Nettie Truax of\r\nSundance, a school teacher and at one time county superintendent. Mrs.\r\nMiller was a successful merchant and at the time of her election was\r\nat the head of a large drygoods establishment. She succeeded her son\r\nin the Legislature. Miss Truax was made chairman of the important\r\nCommittee on Education. In 1915 Mrs. Morna Wood, also of Sundance, was\r\nelected to the Lower House. She introduced a bill, which became a law,\r\nfor the protection and regulation of child employment. During this\r\nsession a bill in the direction of easy divorce came before the House\r\nand Mrs. Wood made a strong speech condemning it and appealing for\r\nloyal support of her protest in the interests of the home and the\r\nchildren. Nothing further was heard of the bill. While women may not\r\nhave taken a large place as lawmakers they have had an active and\r\neffective interest in many excellent laws.\r\n\r\nThe following women have been elected State Superintendent of Public\r\nInstruction: Miss Estelle Reel, 1894-1898; Miss Rose A. Bird,\r\n1910-1914; Miss Edith K. O. Clark, 1914-1918; Mrs. Katharine A.\r\nMorton, 1918-1922. This is the most highly paid office occupied by a\r\nwoman, the salary being the same as that of the Secretary of State,\r\nState Auditor and State Treasurer. By virtue of her office the\r\nSuperintendent is a member of the State Boards of Pardons, Charities\r\nand Reforms, Land Commissioners, School Land Commissioners and\r\nEducation, with power to appoint all members of the last board, which\r\nelects the State Commissioner of Education. At present all the\r\ncounties have women county superintendents of schools, not an unusual\r\nsituation. They also hold other county offices and as in all States as\r\nsoon as the suffrage is granted are eligible to all official\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nThe largest woman's organization is the Federation of Clubs, with a\r\nmembership of 4,000, a democratic body which has been able to do much\r\nfor the State in legislation, education and reform. The women of\r\nWyoming have been very conservative with the ballot and have never\r\nused radical means to accomplish their aims. No woman's ticket has\r\never been offered.\r\n\r\nAll institutions of learning are co-educational. Since 1891 there has\r\nbeen but a short interval when women have not been on the Board of\r\nTrustees of the State University. Grace Raymond Hebard was the first,\r\nserving thirteen years. For eighteen years, 1891-1908, a woman was\r\nsecretary, acting also as financial agent, buying for the institution\r\nand paying the bills. In February, 1913, Mrs. Mary B. David of Douglas\r\nwas appointed trustee by the Governor and displayed such unusual\r\nability as an executive that later she was unanimously elected by the\r\nBoard as its president, serving from September, 1917, to February,\r\n1919, when she removed from the State. During her administration more\r\nimportant matters than ever before were brought to the Board for its\r\nconsideration and solution--questions of land leases and oil grants,\r\nrents and royalties involving millions of dollars. The efficient,\r\nintelligent and impartial way in which Mrs. David handled these\r\nmatters, of course in conjunction with the other members, won for her\r\nfrom the Board and the parties involved the strongest commendation. At\r\none time a woman was seriously thought of for president of the\r\nuniversity but she refused to consider it. At present (1920) two of\r\nthe four most highly paid professors are women at the head of the\r\ncombined departments of Psychology and Philosophy and of Political\r\nEconomy and Sociology. There are five women on the Faculty, receiving\r\nthe same compensation as the men holding equal positions. Women are\r\nfull professors in History, English and Home Economics. The professor\r\nof Elementary Education and supervisor of the training school is a\r\nwoman and the Dean of Women ranks as a full professor. With the\r\nassistant professors there are fourteen women on the Faculty.\r\n\r\nOn June 12, 1921, this university gave its first honorary degree and\r\nvery appropriately to a woman. With beautiful ceremonies the degree of\r\nDoctor of Laws was conferred on Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, president of\r\nthe National American Woman Suffrage Association and of the\r\nInternational Woman Suffrage Alliance.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[212] The History is indebted for this chapter to Dr. Grace Raymond\r\nHebard, professor of Political Economy and Sociology in the State\r\nUniversity of Wyoming.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nWOMAN SUFFRAGE IN THE TERRITORIES OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE\r\nPHILIPPINES.\r\n\r\nALASKA.[213]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the bill was before Congress in 1912 to make Alaska a Territory\r\nof the United States an amendment was added on motion of\r\nRepresentative Frank W. Mondell of Wyoming to give its Legislature\r\nfull power to enfranchise women. This was accepted by the House\r\nwithout objection. Afterwards the official board of the National\r\nAmerican Woman Suffrage Association gladly responded to the request of\r\nArthur G. Stroup of Sitka, one of the Territorial Representatives, who\r\nintended to introduce a bill for the purpose, to send up some suitable\r\nliterature. The board also asked women in Seattle, former residents of\r\nAlaska, to write to the members of the new Legislature.\r\n\r\nWoman suffrage in Alaska possesses the unique record of being granted\r\nwithout any solicitation whatever from the residents. It is not known\r\nthat a suffrage club ever existed in the Territory; it is quite\r\ncertain that prior to the convening of the first Territorial\r\nLegislature in Juneau in 1913 no suffrage campaigning whatever had\r\nbeen carried on, yet two members, coming from towns not less than\r\n1,500 miles apart, brought drafts for an equal suffrage bill. House\r\nBill No. 2, \"An Act to extend the elective franchise to the women in\r\nthe Territory of Alaska,\" was the first to pass both Houses--7\r\nSenators and 15 Representatives--and the vote on it was unanimous,\r\nSenator Elwood Brunner of Nome, the only member who had expressed\r\nhimself as unfavorable, having had the good sense or caution to absent\r\nhimself during roll call. This was also the first bill to be approved\r\nby the Governor, J. F. A. Strong, on March 21, 1913, and the Act\r\nbecame effective ninety days thereafter. It declared the elective\r\nfranchise extended to such women as had the qualifications required of\r\nmale electors.\r\n\r\nThe Alaska Code had permitted women to vote only at School elections.\r\nThe new law gave them the privilege of voting for the officers in\r\nincorporated towns and cities; for members of the Territorial\r\nLegislature and for Territorial Delegate to Congress.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that there is a white population of 30,000 of whom\r\nbetween 5,000 and 6,000 are women. Probably not 500 native women are\r\nvoters. Indian men have a vote if they have \"severed tribal\r\nrelations,\" which is interpreted to mean that if an Indian moves to a\r\nwhite man's town or lives on a creek or in a camp in such a way that\r\nthe missions or the marshals think he has left his tribe, he can vote.\r\nIndian women have a vote if they marry white men who have a vote; if\r\nthey are unmarried and have \"severed tribal relations\"; if they are\r\nmarried to an Indian who has \"severed tribal relations.\" The original\r\ncode said definitely that Juries should be drawn from the male\r\ncitizens and it has never been changed. With this exception the rights\r\nof men and women are the same.\r\n\r\nTwo other bills of importance passed by the first Legislature provided\r\nfor the compulsory education of white children and for Juvenile Courts\r\nto look after dependent children and create a Board of Children's\r\nGuardians. This board consists of the District Judge and U. S. Marshal\r\nin each judicial division, together with one woman appointed by the\r\nGovernor, thus creating four such boards in the Territory, one for\r\neach division.\r\n\r\nThe interest of Alaska women in questions affecting local or\r\nTerritorial conditions is intense and their efforts effective, as\r\ntheir work in the prohibition campaign of 1916 proved. This was\r\nessentially a woman's campaign, so well handled that at the plebiscite\r\nheld at the time of the general election in November, 1916, the vote\r\nwas about two to one in favor of prohibition. As a result, Congress\r\nenacted the Bone Dry Prohibition law for the Territory Feb. 14, 1917.\r\nIt is believed that about three-fourths of the qualified women vote\r\nbut there is no means of knowing. The percentage of illiteracy among\r\nwhite women is negligible and the young native women taught at the\r\nGovernment and mission schools can read and write.\r\n\r\nThe women of Alaska did their share in all kinds of war work, for\r\nconservation, bond drives, Red Cross and kindred activities. On\r\naccount of the vast distances and small means of transportation any\r\ngeneral cooperation is impossible. There are two daily papers in\r\nFairbanks with a wide circulation over the entire district, which is\r\nlarger than Texas. The organizing for Red Cross work had to be largely\r\ndone through these papers but in a few months there were about 600\r\nknitters, practically all the women in the district, and thirty\r\norganizations in the mining camps, many of these having only two or\r\nthree women. In Fairbanks, by means of dances, card parties, sales,\r\netc., $8,000 were raised just to buy wool, besides all the funds and\r\n\"drives.\"\r\n\r\nThe interest of Alaskan women in such public questions as affect women\r\nelsewhere is that of the spectator rather than of the worker. When\r\nlegislation on housing and tenement laws, protection of factory\r\nworkers, prevention of child labor and like problems becomes necessary\r\nthey will not be lacking in interest or energy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAWAII.\r\n\r\nThe Organic Act under which the Territories of the United States were\r\ncreated said that at the first election persons with specified\r\nqualifications should be entitled to vote and at subsequent elections\r\nsuch persons as the Territorial Legislature might designate. It was\r\nunder this Act that Wyoming and Utah enfranchised their women in 1869\r\nand 1870 and Washington in 1883.\r\n\r\nWhen in 1899 the Congress was preparing to admit Hawaii as a Territory\r\nthe commission framed a constitution which specifically refused the\r\nprivilege that had been granted to every other Territory of having its\r\nown Legislature decide who should vote after the first election, by\r\ninserting a clause that it \"should not grant to ... any individual any\r\nspecial privilege or franchise without the approval of Congress.\" This\r\nconstitution gave the suffrage to every masculine citizen of whatever\r\nnationality--Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese--who could read and write\r\nEnglish or Hawaiian, and it repeatedly used the word \"male\" to bar\r\nwomen from having a vote or holding an office. The members of this\r\ncommission were Senators John T. Morgan of Alabama and Shelby M.\r\nCullom of Illinois; Representative Robert R. Hitt of Illinois;\r\nPresident Sanford B. Dole and Associate Justice Frear of Hawaii.\r\nJustice Frear said over his own signature that he and President Dole\r\ndesired that the Legislature should have power to authorize woman\r\nsuffrage but the rest of the commission would not permit it. Miss\r\nSusan B. Anthony president, and the Official Board of the National\r\nAmerican Woman Suffrage Association, made vigorous objection to this\r\nabuse of power, sent a protest to every member of Congress and\r\nfollowed this with petitions officially signed by large associations\r\nbut to no avail. The Act was approved by President William McKinley\r\nApril 30, 1900.[214]\r\n\r\nThe women had always exercised great influence in political affairs\r\nand the people of Hawaii resented this discrimination but the U. S.\r\nCongress then and for years afterwards was adamant in its opposition\r\nto woman suffrage anywhere. After the women of Washington, California\r\nand Oregon were enfranchised in 1910-11-12 this resentment found\r\nexpression among the women of Honolulu in 1912, when they called on\r\nMrs. John W. Dorsett to help them organize a suffrage club. They\r\nlearned in October that by good fortune Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,\r\npresident of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance, would stop\r\nthere on her way home from a trip around the world and they arranged\r\nby wireless messages for her to address a mass meeting at the opera\r\nhouse the one evening she would be there. The audience was large and\r\nsympathetic and she learned that every legislative candidate at the\r\napproaching election had announced himself in favor of getting the\r\nvote for women. She met with the suffrage club and found its\r\nconstitution modeled on the one recommended by the National American\r\nWoman Suffrage Association. She was in touch with the women afterwards\r\nand the interest was kept alive.\r\n\r\nBy 1915 the more thoughtful men of the Territory were beginning to\r\nfeel that its women must be enfranchised. Both political parties\r\ndeclared in favor of asking the U. S. Congress for an Act giving the\r\nHawaiian Legislature authority in this matter and that body itself\r\npassed a bill to this effect. This was taken to Washington by the\r\nDelegate from the Territory, J. K. Kalanianaole, who presented it but\r\nit received no attention. He presented it again in 1916, with a like\r\nresult. Soon afterwards Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin F. Pitman of Brookline,\r\nMass., visited the Islands. Mr. Pitman was the son of a Hawaiian\r\nChiefess and although he had not been there since childhood he was the\r\nperson of the highest rank. Mrs. Pitman was prominent among the\r\nsuffrage leaders in Massachusetts and was deeply interested in the\r\nsituation in Hawaii. She attended the opening of the Legislature and\r\nconversed with nearly all the members, finding them to a man in favor\r\nof the bill, and the Legislature adopted strong resolutions calling\r\nupon Congress to sanction it. In answer to a request for her\r\nexperience to use in this chapter she wrote:\r\n\r\n     It was on Jan. 30, 1917, that we arrived in Honolulu and on the\r\n     31st Madame Nakiuna, who was known as the Court historian, gave\r\n     us a large reception at Laniakea. At this fête were all the women\r\n     of the highest social circles in the Islands. Among them were\r\n     Mrs. John W. Dorsett, Mrs. A. P. Taylor, Mrs. Castle-Coleman,\r\n     Miss Mary Ermine Cross and others who had heard of my activities\r\n     in \"the cause\" and importuned me to hold meetings to try to\r\n     arouse a keener interest. I would have consented at once but for\r\n     the fact that almost the first person I saw in this beautiful\r\n     land was the field-secretary of the Massachusetts Association\r\n     Opposed to the Extension of Suffrage to Women. I had a feeling\r\n     that if there was not already an anti-association here there\r\n     would be one the moment I began any serious work and so I advised\r\n     waiting, promising to do my best for them as soon as it seemed\r\n     wise, and so, while I was indeed sorry that the serious illness\r\n     of a relative obliged her to depart for home at a very early\r\n     date, it was amusing to say the least that while she was sailing\r\n     out of the harbor I was holding my first suffrage meeting in the\r\n     home of Mrs. Dorsett. I held meetings on two successive days, one\r\n     attended mostly by the middle class and the other by high caste\r\n     Hawaiians and the \"missionary set,\" which, perhaps, we might\r\n     style their \"400.\" My talk was in the form of a discussion and I\r\n     was surprised and delighted at the fluency of all who spoke,\r\n     their wide knowledge of world affairs and desire for the\r\n     franchise. Many months had passed since the departure of Prince\r\n     Kalanianaole and so they begged me to investigate as soon as I\r\n     returned home. This I promised to do and wrote at once to Mrs.\r\n     Catt all that I heard.\r\n\r\nMrs. Catt sent Mrs. Pitman's letter to Mrs. Maud Wood Park, chairman\r\nof the Congressional Committee of the National Suffrage Association\r\nand she took up the question with Senator John F. Shafroth, chairman\r\nof the Committee on Pacific Islands and Porto Rico. The Delegate from\r\nHawaii, who was deeply interested, welcomed this new force to assist\r\nin pushing the bill, which had simply been neglected. On May 21, 1917,\r\nhe presented still another resolution from the Territorial Legislature\r\nasking for it and on June I Senator Shafroth introduced the following\r\nbill:\r\n\r\n     _Be it enacted_ ... that the Legislature of the Territory of\r\n     Hawaii be, and it is hereby, vested with the power to provide\r\n     that in all elections ... female citizens possessing the same\r\n     qualifications as male citizens shall be entitled to vote.\r\n\r\n     SEC. 2. That the said Legislature is further hereby vested with\r\n     the power to have submitted to the voters of the Territory the\r\n     question of whether or not the female citizens shall be empowered\r\n     to vote....\r\n\r\nThe bill was reported favorably by the committee and passed by the\r\nSenate without objection or even discussion on September 15. In the\r\nHouse it was referred to the Committee on Woman Suffrage, which set\r\nApril 29, 1918, for a hearing. Delegate Kalanianaole had been called\r\nback to Honolulu by business but was represented by his secretary and\r\nthere were present Mrs. Park, who presided, Dr. Anna Howard Shaw,\r\nhonorary president of the National Suffrage Association, and Mrs.\r\nPitman, the principal speaker. Judge John E. Raker was chairman of the\r\ncommittee, which did not need any argument but was interested in\r\nasking many questions of Mrs. Pitman. At the close of the hearing the\r\ncommittee voted unanimously to make a favorable report. The bill was\r\npassed June 3 without a roll call. It was signed by President Wilson\r\non the 13th.\r\n\r\nThe matter was now in the control of the Hawaiian Legislature, which\r\nreceived petitions from a number of organizations of women to exercise\r\nits power to confer the suffrage without a referendum to the voters.\r\nThis was recommended by Governor C. J. McCarthy and early in the\r\nsession of 1919 the Senate took this action and sent the bill to the\r\nHouse. This body under outside influence refused to endorse it but\r\nsubstituted a bill to send the question to the voters. The Senate\r\nwould not accept it and both bills were deadlocked.\r\n\r\nThe women were then spurred to action; old suffrage clubs were\r\nrevived; one was formed in Honolulu of the native high class women and\r\nwhat is known as the \"missionary set,\" a very brilliant group. Mrs.\r\nDorsett made a tour of all the Islands to arouse interest and on\r\nMani, under the leadership of Mrs. Harry Baldwin, clubs were formed\r\nall over the island. A Hawaiian Suffrage Association was organized. At\r\nthe next convention of the National Association a resolution was\r\nadopted that it be invited to become auxiliary without the payment of\r\ndues and the invitation was officially accepted with thanks.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Suffrage Amendment proclaimed by Secretary of State Colby\r\nAug. 26, 1920, included the women of the Territories and it was thus\r\nthat Hawaiian women became enfranchised. They voted in large numbers\r\nat the November elections that year.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHILIPPINES.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Islands came under the jurisdiction of the United\r\nStates as a consequence of the Spanish-American war in 1898 and their\r\ngovernment soon became an active question in Congress. There was a\r\ndesire to permit their own people to participate in this to some\r\nextent and the National American Woman Suffrage Association, always on\r\nthe watch tower, took immediate action toward having women included in\r\nany scheme of self-government. With the recent example before it of\r\nthe most unjust discrimination against them in the admission of Hawaii\r\nas a Territory, the association under the presidency of Miss Susan B.\r\nAnthony petitioned the members of Congress to recognize the rights of\r\nwomen in whatever form of government was adopted. At its annual\r\nconvention in 1899 impassioned speeches were made against taking away\r\nfrom Filipino women the position of superiority which they always had\r\nheld under Spanish rule by giving the men political authority over\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 Military Governor-General Otis ordered a re-organization of\r\nthe municipalities. To decide who should have a vote in local affairs\r\nthe Philippine Commission of the U. S. Senate summoned well informed\r\npersons and among them, in the spring of 1902, were Judge William H.\r\nTaft, Governor-General of the islands, and Archbishop Nozaleda, who\r\nhad been connected with the Catholic church there for twenty-six years\r\nand archbishop since 1889. Both declared that the suffrage should be\r\ngiven to the women rather than to the men, the former saying: \"The\r\nfact is that, not only among the Tagalogs but also among the\r\nChristian Filipinos, the woman is the active manager of the family, so\r\nif you expect to confer political power on the Filipinos it ought to\r\nbe given to the women. Following is part of the Archbishop's\r\nstatement. (Senate Document, p. 109.):\r\n\r\n     The woman is better than the man in every way--in intelligence,\r\n     in virtue and in labor--and a great deal more economical. She is\r\n     very much given to trade and trafficking. If any rights and\r\n     privileges are to be granted to the natives, do not give them to\r\n     the men but to the women.\r\n\r\n     Q. Then you think it would be much better to give the women the\r\n     right to vote than the men?\r\n\r\n     A. O, much better. Why, even in the fields it is the women who do\r\n     the work; the men go to the cock fights and gamble. The woman is\r\n     the one who supports the man there, so every law of justice\r\n     demands that in political life they should have the privilege\r\n     over the men.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this and other testimony of a similar nature the\r\nCommission framed a Code giving a Municipal or local franchise to\r\ncertain classes of men and excluding all women, taking away from them\r\nthe privileges they always had possessed. The men soon began demanding\r\ntheir own lawmaking body and in response Congress passed an Act to\r\ntake effect Jan. 15, 1907, to provide for the holding of elections in\r\nthe Islands for a Legislative Assembly. The Act limited the voters to\r\n\"male persons 23 years of age or over,\" thus again putting up the\r\nbarriers against women and including them in the list of the\r\ndisqualified as listed--\"insane, feeble-minded, rebels and traitors.\"\r\n\r\nThe U. S. Government did, however, give women to the same extent as\r\nmen all educational advantages, which heretofore had been denied them\r\nand their progress was very rapid. In 1912 Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,\r\npresident of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance, visited Manila\r\non her trip around the world and was warmly received. A meeting was\r\ncalled at the Manila Hotel for August 15 and twelve women responded.\r\nAfter making an address she helped them form a club which they called\r\nSociety for the Advancement of Women. Thirty attended the next meeting\r\ntwo weeks later and they took up active philanthropic work. In a\r\nlittle while most of the women of influence were members of it and it\r\nwas re-organized as the Woman's Club of Manila. Its work extended in\r\nmany directions and it became one of the city's leading institutions.\r\nOther clubs were formed and they joined the General Federation of\r\nClubs in 1915. There are between 300 and 400 clubs in the Islands\r\n(1920).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the men were not satisfied with their one-house Legislative\r\nAssembly largely under American control, but wanted more power. In\r\nresponse Congress provided for a Legislature of a Senate of 24 members\r\nand a Lower House of 90, all to be elected except two of the former\r\nand nine of the latter, who would be appointed by the American\r\nGovernor-General to represent districts where elections were not held,\r\nthe Act to go into effect in 1918. The suffrage was still confined\r\nexclusively to males, although in 1916 the Women's Club had organized\r\nfifty-seven Mothers' Clubs for the welfare of infants; had secured\r\nthrough women lawyers legal aid for over thirty poor women; had been\r\ninstrumental in having 15,000 people make gardens to give variety to\r\ntheir fish and rice diet and done a vast amount of other valuable\r\npublic work. The Act passed by large majorities, members voting for it\r\nwho had persistently voted against the Federal Amendment to\r\nenfranchise the women of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Philippines were from 1917 represented in Congress by an able and\r\nprogressive Commissioner, Jaime C. De Veyra, an advocate of woman\r\nsuffrage. His wife, a native of Iloilo, who had been prominent in\r\ncivic work in the Islands, shared his views, and was a frequent\r\nvisitor at the suffrage headquarters in Washington. In 1919, assisted\r\nby Miss Bessie Dwyer, vice-president of the Manila Women's Club, she\r\ngave beautifully illustrated addresses in Washington and New York, on\r\nthe position of women in the Islands. In these and in interviews she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     Philippine women have always been free and have always been held\r\n     as equals of the men. In the little rural \"barrios\" you will\r\n     always find some sort of woman leader. All over the islands they\r\n     are highly considered. Even when old they exercise full sway over\r\n     the family and have the last word in all financial matters. The\r\n     married children still cling to the mother as adviser. The young\r\n     women who marry go into partnership with their husbands and while\r\n     the men handle the workers it is the women who do the paying and\r\n     oversee things generally. They are engaged in all kinds of\r\n     business for themselves and are employed by scores of thousands.\r\n     Many thousands carry work home where they can take care of their\r\n     children, do the housework and be earning money.\r\n\r\n     They have the same opportunities in the professions as men, are\r\n     successful physicians and lawyers and members of the Bar\r\n     Association. Laws made for them have combined the best of Spanish\r\n     and American precedents. They are guardians of their own\r\n     children; married women may hold property; of that which accrues\r\n     to a married couple, the wife is half administrator. These are\r\n     vested rights and cannot be taken away.\r\n\r\n     A short time ago the question of woman suffrage was introduced\r\n     into the Legislature, not by the initiative of American women but\r\n     urged by Madame Apacibile, wife of one of the government\r\n     secretaries. A petition signed by 18,000 women asking for a joint\r\n     legislative hearing was sent to the law makers who granted it.\r\n     Three Filipina women spoke, one the widow of the eminent\r\n     Concepcion Calderon, a successful business woman, owning a fish\r\n     farm and an embroidery enterprise. Others were Mrs. Feodore\r\n     Kalon, Miss Almeda and Miss Pazlegaspi, the last two practicing\r\n     lawyers. Only one man appeared in the negative. The president of\r\n     the Senate, the Hon. Manuel L. Quezon, is in favor of woman\r\n     suffrage.\r\n\r\nGovernor-General Francis Burton Harrison recommended to the\r\nLegislature to give the suffrage to women, as it has the power to do.\r\nA bill was introduced and passed the Senate almost unanimously Dec. 7,\r\n1919, but it was not acted upon by the House. As the Constitution of\r\nthe United States is not in force in the Philippines the women were\r\nnot enfranchised by the Federal Suffrage Amendment in 1920 but must\r\nawait the action of their own Legislature.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTO RICO.\r\n\r\nAfter Porto Rico came under the control of the United States as a\r\nresult of the Spanish-American war in 1898 its political status was\r\nundetermined for a long time. Shortly before that war Spain had\r\ngranted universal suffrage to all its men over 21. Congress confirmed\r\nthis privilege as to the affairs of the island but they had no voting\r\nrights in those of the United States. After a few years the more\r\nprogressive of the people began asking for the status of a Territory\r\nwith their own Legislature. This agitation was continued for sixteen\r\nyears before Congress took action and agreed on a bill which would\r\nadmit the islanders to citizenship. As usual the chief difficulty was\r\nover the suffrage. There was a desire to have a slight educational and\r\na small property qualification but as a large majority of the men\r\nwere illiterate and without property this aroused a protest, which was\r\nsupported by the American Federation of Labor. On May 22, 1916, while\r\nthe Porto Rican bill was under consideration in Committee of the Whole\r\nin the Lower House of Congress, the Republican floor leader, James R.\r\nMann (Ills.), discovered that a majority of those present were\r\nRepublicans and suffragists. He therefore proposed a clause giving the\r\nfranchise to the women, which was passed by 60 to 37. He expected to\r\nput the Democrats in the position of voting it down the next day in\r\nregular session but when it came up Republicans joined with Democrats\r\nin defeating it by 80 noes to 59 ayes.\r\n\r\nFinally when, under pressure, the committee was obliged to put in\r\nuniversal suffrage for the great mass of illiterate men, even the most\r\nardent advocates of woman suffrage among the members felt that it\r\nwould be unwise to add universal suffrage for women. In answer to the\r\nurgent request of the Congressional Committee of the National American\r\nWoman Suffrage Association that this injustice should not be done to\r\nwomen, Senator John F. Shafroth, chairman of the Committee on the\r\nPacific Islands and Porto Rico, wrote: \"I would have been very glad to\r\nincorporate a provision including women but it would have killed the\r\nbill. I was notified by Senator Martine of New Jersey and others that\r\nthey would not permit a provision of that kind to go into it and the\r\nparliamentary stage of the bill was such that any one Senator could\r\nhave defeated it. As it was, it took two years to get the bill before\r\nCongress and fully twenty motions to have it considered and if either\r\nprohibition or woman suffrage had gone into it there would have been\r\nno bill for Porto Rico. We avoided the word 'male' in prescribing the\r\nqualifications of electors.\"\r\n\r\nThe Act, which received the approval of President Wilson March 2,\r\n1917, provided that at the first election for the Legislature and\r\nother officers the electors should be those qualified under the\r\npresent law, and thereafter voters should be citizens of the United\r\nStates 21 years of age and have such additional qualifications as\r\nmight be prescribed by the Legislature of Porto Rico. The election\r\ntook place on July 16. While this Act was an improvement on the one\r\nwhich admitted Hawaii as a Territory it left the many educated, tax\r\npaying women, the woman in business, the teachers in government and\r\nmission schools, the nurses in the hospitals, the social workers,\r\nwholly in the power of men.\r\n\r\nAbout 1916 there was incorporated in Porto Rico an organization called\r\nLa Liga Feminea de Puerto Rico, which worked energetically for the\r\nsocial uplift of the people and for the political enfranchisement of\r\nwomen. The official organ was _La Mujer del Siglo Veinte_--_The\r\nTwentieth Century Woman_. Early in the spring of 1917 Mrs. Geraldine\r\nMaud Froscher, an American living in Porto Rico, appealed to the\r\nNational Suffrage Association for financial assistance for a campaign\r\npreparatory to the introduction of the woman suffrage bill in the\r\nLegislature that year. Literature was sent immediately and the\r\nassociation agreed to pay the expenses of Mrs. Froscher, who organized\r\nsuffrage leagues in all towns of any considerable size, addressed\r\nwomen's clubs, interviewed legislators and distributed literature. In\r\nthis work she had the able assistance of Mrs. Ana Roqué Duprey, the\r\nfirst president of the San Juan Suffrage League, editor of the above\r\npaper and later of _El Heraldo de la Mujer_--_The Woman's Herald_,\r\nwith Mrs. Froscher as the American editor.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1917, at the first session of the new Legislature, a bill\r\nwas introduced in the Lower House to give women the right to hold\r\noffice but without the right to vote and one to give them equal\r\nrights. Later two more bills were introduced but none was passed. As\r\nPorto Rico is an unincorporated Territory of the United States, its\r\nwomen were not enfranchised by the Federal Suffrage Amendment in 1920.\r\nAt three consecutive sessions of the Legislative Assembly a petition\r\nfor woman suffrage has been presented.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[213] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Jeannette Drury\r\nClark, a graduate of the University of California, who with her\r\nhusband, John A. Clark, an attorney, has made her home in Fairbanks\r\nfor the past fifteen years.\r\n\r\n[214] History of Woman Suffrage, Volume IV, pages 325, 343, 346, 446.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF THE WOMEN'S MOVEMENT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.\r\n\r\n1900 - 1920.[215]\r\n\r\n\r\nI consider it an honor to have been asked to take up the pen from the\r\ndate 1900, when my dear friend and colleague, the late Helen\r\nBlackburn, laid it down after writing the chapter on Great Britain for\r\nVolume IV of the History of Woman Suffrage. I am particularly\r\nfortunate in that it falls to my lot to include the year 1918, when\r\nVictory crowned our fifty years' struggle in these islands to obtain\r\nthe Parliamentary franchise for women.\r\n\r\nSeveral circumstances entirely outside our power of control combined\r\nto promote the rapid growth of the movement at the beginning of the\r\nXXth Century. The chief of these were the South African war,\r\n1899-1902, and the death of Queen Victoria in 1901. The war with the\r\nTransvaal was caused by the refusal of President Kruger and his\r\nadvisers to recognize the principle that taxation and representation\r\nshould go together. The so-called Uitlanders, who formed a large\r\nproportion of the population of the Transvaal and provided by taxation\r\na still larger proportion of its revenue, were practically excluded\r\nfrom representation. This led to intense irritation and ultimately to\r\nwar. It was, therefore, inevitable that articles in the press and the\r\nspeeches of British statesmen dealing with the war used arguments\r\nwhich might have been transferred without the alteration of a single\r\nword to women's suffrage speeches.\r\n\r\nI have described on pages 29 and 30 of Women's Suffrage, a Short\r\nHistory of a Great Movement, the strong impulse which had been given\r\nto the electorial activity of British women by the Corrupt Practices\r\nAct of 1883, which made paid canvassing illegal and otherwise reduced\r\nelectorial expenses. Very soon after it came into operation both the\r\nchief political parties organized bands of educated women to act as\r\ncanvassers, election agents, etc., in contested elections. The war\r\nstimulated this electorial activity of women. A general election was\r\nheld in 1900 and in the absence of husbands, sons and brothers in\r\nSouth Africa, many wives, mothers and sisters ran the whole election\r\non their behalf. Several of these were well known anti-suffragists.\r\nEven Mrs. Humphry Ward herself, on the occasion of an important\r\nanti-suffrage meeting in London, excused her absence on the ground\r\nthat her presence was required by the exigencies of the pending\r\nelection in West Herts, where her son was a candidate. Suffragists\r\nagain were not slow to point the moral--if women were fit (and they\r\nobviously were fit) not only to advise, persuade and instruct voters\r\nhow to vote but also to conduct election campaigns from start to\r\nfinish, they were surely fit to vote themselves.\r\n\r\nThe death of Queen Victoria in January, 1901, called forth a\r\nspontaneous burst of loyal gratitude, devotion and appreciation from\r\nall parties and all sections of the country. Every leading statesman\r\namong her councillors dwelt on the extraordinary penetration of her\r\nmind, her wide political knowledge, her great practical sagacity, her\r\ngrasp of principle, and they combined to acclaim her as the most\r\ntrusted of all the constitutional monarchs whom the world had then\r\nseen. How could she be all that they justly claimed for her, if the\r\nwhole female sex laboured under the disabilities which, according to\r\nMrs. Humphry Ward, were imposed by nature and therefore irremediable?\r\nNevertheless, it must not be supposed, genuine as were these tributes\r\nto Queen Victoria's political sagacity, that her example immediately\r\ncleared out of the minds of the opponents the notion that women were\r\nfitly classed with aliens, felons, idiots and lunatics, as persons who\r\nfor reasons of public safety were debarred from the exercise of the\r\nParliamentary franchise.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament returned in 1906 had an immense Liberal majority. There\r\nwere only 157 Unionist members in the House of Commons against 513\r\nLiberals, Labour men and Nationalists, all of whom were for Home Rule\r\nand therefore prepared to support in all critical divisions the new\r\nadministration which was formed under the Premiership of Sir Henry\r\nCampbell Bannerman. The new House contained 426 members pledged to\r\nWomen's Suffrage. The Premier was himself a suffragist but his Cabinet\r\ncontained several determined anti-suffragists, notable among whom were\r\nMr. Herbert H. Asquith, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Mr. James\r\nBryce, chief secretary for Ireland (now Lord Bryce), who became\r\nBritish Ambassador to the United States in 1907. The new Prime\r\nMinister received a large, representative suffrage deputation in May,\r\n1906, in which all sections of suffragist opinion were represented,\r\nand their case was laid before him with force and clearness. In reply\r\nhe told them that they had made out \"a conclusive and irrefutable\r\ncase\" but that he was not prepared to take any steps to realize their\r\nhopes. When asked what he would advise ardent suffragists to do he\r\ntold them to \"go on pestering.\" This advice was taken to heart by the\r\ngroup (a small minority of the whole) who had lately formed in\r\nManchester the organization known as The Women's Social and Political\r\nUnion, led by Mrs. Pankhurst.\r\n\r\nAn unforeseen misfortune was the death in 1908 of Sir H. C. Bannerman\r\nand the fact that his successor was our principal opponent in the\r\nGovernment, Mr. Asquith. It was not very long before he revealed the\r\nline of his attack upon the enfranchisement of women. He informed his\r\nparty in May, 1908, that his intention was to introduce before the\r\nexpiration of the existing Parliament a Reform Bill giving a wide\r\nextension of the franchise to men and no franchise at all to women. In\r\nthe previous February a Women's Suffrage Bill which removed all sex\r\ndisability from existing franchises had passed its second reading in\r\nthe House of Commons but this apparently had no effect on Mr. Asquith.\r\nThere were, however, some cracks in his armour. He admitted that about\r\ntwo-thirds of his Cabinet and a majority of his party were favourable\r\nto Women's Suffrage and he promised that when his own exclusively male\r\nReform Bill was before the House and had got into committee, if an\r\namendment to include women were moved on democratic lines, his\r\nGovernment, as a Government, would not oppose it. This was at all\r\nevents an advance on the position taken by Mr. Gladstone upon his\r\nReform Bill of 1884, when he vehemently opposed a women's suffrage\r\namendment and caused it to be defeated.\r\n\r\nThe emergence of what was afterwards known as \"militancy\" belongs to\r\nthis period, dating from the General Election of 1906 and very much\r\nstimulated by Premier Bannerman's reply to the deputation in that year\r\nand by the attitude of Mr. Asquith. It will ever be an open question\r\non which different people, with equal opportunities of forming a\r\njudgment, will pronounce different verdicts, whether \"militancy\" did\r\nmore harm or good to the suffrage cause. It certainly broke down the\r\n\"conspiracy of silence\" on the subject up to then observed by the\r\npress. Every extravagance, every folly, every violent expression, and\r\nof course when the \"militants\" after 1908 proceeded to acts of\r\nviolence, every outrage against person or property were given the\r\nwidest possible publicity not only in Great Britain but all over the\r\nworld. There was soon not an intelligent human being in any country\r\nwho was not discussing Women's Suffrage and arguing either for or\r\nagainst it. This was an immense advantage to the movement, for we had,\r\nas Sir H. Campbell Bannerman had said, \"a conclusive and irrefutable\r\ncase.\" Our difficulty had been to get it heard and considered and this\r\n\"militancy\" secured. The anti-suffrage press believed that it would\r\nkill the movement and it was this belief which encouraged them to give\r\nit the widest possible publicity. The wilder and more extravagant the\r\n\"militants\" became the more they were quoted, described and advertised\r\nin every way. The sort of \"copy\" which anti-suffrage papers demanded\r\nwas supplied by them in cartloads and not at all by law-abiding\r\nsuffragists, who were an immense majority of the whole. This can be\r\nillustrated by an anecdote. The Constitutional suffragists had\r\norganized a big meeting in Trafalgar Square and had secured a strong\r\nteam of first-rate speakers. The square was well filled and on the\r\nfringe of the crowd the following conversation was overheard between\r\ntwo press men who had come to report the proceedings. One said he was\r\ngoing away, the second asked why and the first answered: \"It's no good\r\nstopping, there's no copy in this; these women are only talking\r\nsense!\"\r\n\r\nThe earlier years of militant activity were in my opinion helpful to\r\nthe whole movement, for up to 1908 the \"militants\" had only adopted\r\nsensational and unusual methods, such as waving flags and making\r\nspeeches in the lobby of the House and asking inconvenient questions\r\nat public meetings. They had suffered a great deal of violence but had\r\nused none. From 1908 onwards, however, they began to use violence,\r\nstone throwing, personal attacks, sometimes with whips, on obnoxious\r\nmembers of the Government, window smashing, the destruction of the\r\ncontents of letter-boxes--in one instance the destruction of ballot\r\npapers cast in an election. Later arson practised for the destruction\r\nor attempted destruction of churches and houses became more and more\r\nfrequent. All this had an intensely irritating effect on public\r\nopinion. \"Suffragist\" as far as the general public was concerned\r\nbecame almost synonymous with \"Harpy.\" This cause which had not been\r\ndefeated on a straight vote in the House of Commons since 1886 was now\r\ntwice defeated; once in 1912 and once in 1913. The whole spirit\r\nengendered by attempting to gain by violence or threats of violence\r\nwhat was not conceded to justice and reason was intensely inimical to\r\nthe spirit of our movement. We believed with profound conviction that\r\nwhatever might be gained in that way did not and could not rest on a\r\nsure foundation. The women's movement was an appeal against government\r\nby physical force and those who used physical violence in order to\r\npromote it were denying their faith to make their faith prevail.\r\n\r\nThe difference made a deep rift in the suffrage movement. The\r\nconstitutional societies felt bound to exclude \"militants\" from their\r\nmembership and on several occasions issued strongly-worded protests\r\nagainst the use of violence as political propaganda. The fact that men\r\nunder similar circumstances had been much more violent and\r\ndestructive, especially in earlier days when they were less civilized,\r\ndid not inspire us with the wish to imitate them. We considered that\r\nthey had been wrong and that \"direct action,\" as it is now the fashion\r\nto call coercion by means of physical force, had always reacted\r\nunfavorably on those who employed it. While the constitutional\r\nsocieties freely and repeatedly expressed their views on these points,\r\nthe \"militants\" not unnaturally retorted by attempting to break up our\r\nmeetings, shouting down our speakers and provoking every sort of\r\ndisorder at them. It was an exceptionally difficult situation and\r\nthat we won through as well as we did was due to the solid loyalty to\r\nconstitutional and law-abiding methods of propaganda of the great mass\r\nof suffragists throughout the country. We quoted the American proverb,\r\n\"Three hornets can upset a camp meeting,\" and we determined to hold\r\nsteadily on our way and not let our hornets upset us. Our societies\r\nmultiplied rapidly both in numbers and in membership. For instance,\r\nthe number forming the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies\r\nincreased from 64 in 1909 to 130 in 1910 and went on increasing\r\nrapidly until just before the war in 1914 they numbered more than 600,\r\nwith a revenue of over 42,000 pounds a year.\r\n\r\nMore important in many ways than the \"militant\" movement was the\r\nemergence at the General Election in 1906 of the Labour Party. Mr.\r\nKeir Hardie, Mr. Philip Snowden and others of its leaders were very\r\nstrong supporters of women's suffrage and it was not long before the\r\nparty definitely made the enfranchisement of women on the same terms\r\nas men a plank in its platform. In anticipation of the first General\r\nElection of 1910, the N.U.W.S.S. addressed the leaders of the three\r\nBritish parties, Conservative, Liberal, and Labour, asking them what\r\nthey were prepared to do for Women's Suffrage. Mr. Asquith gave his\r\nanswer at an Albert Hall meeting in December, 1909. He reiterated his\r\nintention, if returned to power, of bringing in a Reform Bill, and he\r\npromised to make the insertion of a Women's Suffrage amendment an open\r\nquestion for the House of Commons to decide. He added: \"The Government\r\n... has no disposition or desire to burke the question; it is clearly\r\nan issue on which the new House ought to be given an opportunity to\r\nexpress its views.\" This meant that the Government whips would not be\r\nput on to oppose the enfranchisement of women. Mr. Balfour replied to\r\nour memorial that it was a non-party question on which members of the\r\nUnionist Party could exercise individual freedom of action. Mr. Arthur\r\nHenderson, for the Labour Party, told us that it had already placed\r\nthe enfranchisement of women on its programme. The Labour Party was\r\nnot large but it was an important advantage to us to have even a small\r\nparty definitely pledged to our support. There were two General\r\nElections in 1910, in January and December. The Liberal, Labour and\r\nNationalist group lost heavily in the second of these elections, their\r\nmajority being reduced from 334 to 124.\r\n\r\nThe Labour Party between these two elections had lost six seats but\r\nthey were still forty strong, all definitely pledged to Women's\r\nSuffrage in the new Parliament which assembled in January, 1911. Our\r\nBill had been carried on its second reading in 1910 by a majority of\r\n110 but after the second General Election of 1910 it secured on May 5,\r\n1911, a majority of 167; there were 55 pairs, only 88 members of\r\nParliament going into the Lobby against us. The Bill on each of these\r\noccasions was of a very limited character; it proposed to enfranchise\r\nwomen-householders, widows and spinsters and would only have added\r\nabout a million women to the Parliamentary register. It was called the\r\nConciliation Bill, because it sought to conciliate the differences\r\nbetween different types of suffragists in the House of Commons, from\r\nthe extreme Conservative who only cared for the representation of\r\nwomen of property, to the extreme Radical who demanded the\r\nenfranchisement of every woman. A committee was formed to promote the\r\nsuccess of this bill in Parliament of which the Earl of Lytton was\r\nChairman and Mr. H. N. Brailsford Hon. Sec. It was believed that the\r\nbill represented the greatest common measure of the House of Commons'\r\nbelief in women's votes. The Labour Party were strongly in favour of a\r\nmuch wider enfranchisement of women but generously waived their own\r\npreferences in order, as they believed, to get some sort of\r\nrepresentation for women on the Statute Book. Almost immediately after\r\nthis large majority for the second reading of the Conciliation Bill in\r\nMay, 1911, an official announcement was made by the Government that\r\nMr. Asquith's promise of the previous November that an opportunity\r\nshould be afforded for proceeding with the bill in all its stages\r\nwould be fulfilled in the session of 1912.\r\n\r\nWe were then in the most favourable position we had ever occupied; the\r\npassing of the Women's Suffrage Bill in the near future seemed a\r\ncertainty. The \"militants\" had suspended all their methods of violence\r\nin order to give the Conciliation Bill a chance, and, as just\r\ndescribed, it had passed its second reading debate with a majority of\r\n167 and time for \"proceeding effectively\" with a similar Bill in all\r\nits stages had been promised. All the suffrage societies were working\r\nharmoniously for the same Bill and the Women's Liberal Federation were\r\ncooperating with the suffrage societies, when suddenly, like a bolt\r\nfrom the blue, Mr. Asquith dealt us a characteristic blow. In reply to\r\na deputation from the People's Suffrage Federation early in November\r\nhe announced his intention of introducing during the coming session of\r\n1912 the Electoral Reform Bill which he had foreshadowed in 1908; he\r\nsaid that in this Bill all existing franchises would be swept away,\r\nplural voting abolished and the period of residence reduced. The new\r\nfranchise to be created was, he added, to be based on citizenship and\r\nvotes were to be given to \"citizens of full age and competent\r\nunderstanding,\" but no mention was made of the enfranchisement of\r\nwomen. On being asked what he intended to do about women's votes, he\r\ndismissed the subject with the remark that his opinions on the subject\r\nwere well known and had suffered no change, but he reiterated the\r\npromise of \"facilities\" for the Conciliation Bill in the 1912 Session.\r\n\r\nThe situation, therefore, was briefly this: An agitation of\r\never-growing intensity and determination had for some years been\r\ncarried on by women for their own enfranchisement and no agitation at\r\nall had been manifested by men for more votes for themselves; the\r\nPrime Minister's response to this situation was to promise legislation\r\ngiving far larger and wider representation to men and none at all to\r\nwomen. No wonder that he provoked an immediate outburst of militancy!\r\nStones were thrown and windows smashed all along the Strand,\r\nPiccadilly, Whitehall and Bond Street, and members of the Government\r\nwent about in perpetual apprehension of personal assault.\r\n\r\nThe indignation of the Constitutional suffragists and of the Women's\r\nLiberal Federation with Mr. Asquith was quite as real as that of the\r\n\"suffragettes\" but it sought a different method of expression. Some\r\nknowledge of this probably reached him, as for the first time in our\r\nexperience all the suffrage societies and the W.L.F. were invited by\r\nthe Prime Minister to form a deputation to him on the subject. What we\r\nwere accustomed to was sending an urgent demand to him to receive us\r\nin a deputation and to get his reply that he believed \"no useful\r\npurpose would be served\" by yielding to our request; but now, in\r\nNovember, 1911, he was inviting us to come and see him! Of course we\r\nwent. His whole demeanor was much more conciliatory than it had ever\r\nbeen before. He acknowledged the strength and intensity of the demand\r\nof women for representation and admitted that in opposing it he was in\r\na minority both in his Cabinet and in his party; finally he added\r\nthat, although his personal opinions on the subject prevented him from\r\ninitiating and proposing the change which women were pressing for, he\r\nwas prepared to bow to and acquiesce in the considered judgment of the\r\nHouse of Commons, and he stated that this course was quite in\r\naccordance with the best traditions of English public life. The\r\nNational Union of Women's Suffrage Societies, of which I was the\r\nmouthpiece, then put the following questions:\r\n\r\n(1) Is it the intention of the Government that the Reform Bill shall\r\ngo through all its stages in 1912?\r\n\r\n(2) Will the Bill be drafted in such a way as to admit of amendments\r\nintroducing women on other terms than men?\r\n\r\n(3) Will the Government undertake not to oppose such amendments?\r\n\r\n(4) Will the Government regard any amendment enfranchising women,\r\nwhich is carried, as an integral part of the Bill be defended by the\r\nGovernment in all its later stages?\r\n\r\nTo all these questions, as they were put severally, Mr. Asquith\r\nreplied \"Yes, certainly.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Lloyd George, who was present, was pressed by the deputation to\r\nspeak but did so only very briefly. He was known as an opponent of the\r\nConciliation Bill but had voted for it in 1911 because it was so\r\ndrafted as to admit of free amendment. He made no secret of his\r\nconviction that the wider enfranchisement afforded by amendment of the\r\nGovernment measure would, to use his own expression, \"torpedo\" the\r\nConciliation Bill. Almost immediately after the deputation thus\r\ndescribed he sent the following message to the N.U.W.S.S.: \"The Prime\r\nMinister's pronouncement as to the attitude to be adopted by the\r\nGovernment towards the question seems to make the carrying of a\r\nWomen's Suffrage Amendment to next year's Franchise Bill a certainty.\r\nI am willing to do all in my power to help those who are labouring to\r\nreach a successful issue in the coming session. Next year provides the\r\nsupreme opportunity and nothing but unwise handling of that chance can\r\ncompass failure.\"\r\n\r\nThere was plenty of unwise handling, but not, as I am proud to think,\r\nfrom the constitutional suffragists. The first was the wild outburst\r\nof \"militancy\" already referred to. Mr. Lloyd George was pursued by\r\npersistent interruption and annoyance deliberately organised by the\r\nWomen's Social and Political Union. A meeting he addressed at Bath,\r\nmainly devoted to advocacy of Women's Suffrage, on Nov. 24, 1911, was\r\nall but turned into a bear garden by these deliberately planned and\r\nvery noisy interruptions. Not to be outdone in \"unwise handling\" Mr.\r\nAsquith next had his innings. He received an anti-suffrage deputation\r\non Dec. 14, 1911, about three weeks after he had received the\r\nsuffragists, and in the course of his remarks to them he said: \"As an\r\nindividual I am in entire agreement with you that the grant of the\r\nParliamentary Vote to women in this country would be a political\r\nmistake of a very disastrous kind.\" This went far to invalidate the\r\nfair-seeming promises to us given about three weeks earlier. How could\r\na man in the all-important position of Prime Minister pledge himself\r\nto use all the forces at the disposal of the Government to pass in all\r\nits stages through both houses a measure which might include the\r\nperpetration of \"a political mistake of a very disastrous kind\"? A\r\nmember of Mr. Asquith's own party who took part in the anti-suffrage\r\ndeputation interpreted this expression of his chief as an S.O.S. call\r\nto his followers in the House to deliver him from the humiliation of\r\nhaving to fulfil the promises he had given us. Every kind of intrigue\r\nand trick known to the accomplished parliamentarian was put into\r\noperation. Every Irish Nationalist vote was detached from support of\r\nthe Bill. A description of one of these discreditable devices, among\r\nthem an attempt to hold up the N.U.W.S.S. to public contempt as\r\npurveyors of \"obscene\" literature, will be found in a book by myself\r\ncalled The Women's Victory and After, published in 1920.\r\n\r\nThe first result of these intrigues was the defeat of the\r\nConciliation Bill, by 14 votes only, on March 28, 1912. This was\r\nhailed as an immense triumph by the anti-suffragists, as indeed in a\r\nsense it was, for exactly the same bill had been carried by the same\r\nHouse in 1911 by a majority of 167; but it was a triumph which cost\r\nthe victors dear, especially when the tricks and perversions of truth\r\ncame to light by which it had been achieved. From this time forward\r\npublic opinion was more decided in our favour and the general view was\r\nthat the Government had treated us shabbily.\r\n\r\nThe progress made by the Government in pressing forward their\r\nElectoral Reform Bill was not rapid. When it was at last introduced it\r\nwas discovered to be not a Reform Bill, but in the main a Registration\r\nBill. In the second reading debate Mr. Asquith described his Bill as\r\none to enfranchise \"male persons only,\" and said in regard to women\r\nthat he could not conceive that the House would \"so far stultify\r\nitself as to reverse the considered judgment it had already arrived\r\nat\" earlier in the session. It was a \"considered judgment\" to defeat\r\nthe Bill by 14 votes in 1912 but not a \"considered judgment\" to have\r\nit carried by 167 in 1911! Sir Edward Grey felt strongly that the\r\nHouse had placed itself in a very undesirable position, but the\r\nConciliation Bill was defeated and Sir Edward Grey, Mr. Lloyd George\r\nand the leading suffragists in the Government continued to assure us\r\nthat the inclusion of Women's Suffrage through an amendment of the\r\nGovernment Bill presented us with by far the best prospect of success\r\nwe had ever had. We worked as we had never worked before to secure the\r\nsuccess of this amendment or series of amendments. The session of 1912\r\nhad lasted from January to December without the committee stage of the\r\nGovernment Bill being reached. This interminable session overflowed\r\ninto 1913 and the debate on the suffrage amendments of the Government\r\nBill was dated to begin on January 24th of that year. On January 23rd,\r\nhowever, in reply to a question, the Speaker [Mr. Lowther] indicated\r\nthat he would probably be compelled to rule that if the Bill were\r\namended so as to include the enfranchisement of women, he might feel\r\nobliged to rule that in this form it was not the same bill of which\r\nthe second reading had been carried in July, and it would, therefore,\r\nhave to be withdrawn and re-introduced! This ruling he confirmed on\r\nthe following Monday, January 27th. Therefore, every one of the fair\r\npromises which Mr. Asquith had given us in November, 1911, proved to\r\nbe absolutely worthless.\r\n\r\nI do not accuse Mr. Asquith of anything worse at this stage than\r\nblundering. He was manifestly confounded and distressed by the\r\nSpeaker's ruling. Whether this were due to the naming of the Bill or\r\nto Mr. Asquith's own speech on the second reading, \"This is a bill to\r\nenfranchise male persons only, etc.\", we were not able to discover;\r\nbut the net result was that he found himself in a position in which it\r\nwas impossible for him to fulfil the promises he had given us. Under\r\nthese circumstances he did not take the only honorable course open to\r\nhim, i.e., of sending for us once more and asking us what we should\r\nconsider a reasonable equivalent for these unredeemed promises. He had\r\nmade these promises five years back and had repeated them from time to\r\ntime ever since. Now they were null and void. The only reasonable\r\nequivalent would have been the introduction of a Government Reform\r\nBill which included the enfranchisement of women. Probably Mr. Asquith\r\nknew that this was what we should urge; for he not only did not send\r\nfor us but he refused to see us or consult us in any way. He tossed\r\nus, without our consent, the thoroughly worthless substitute of a day\r\nfor a Private Member's Bill, such as we had had experience of time and\r\nagain ever since 1870. The N.U.W.S.S. indignantly rejected this offer\r\nand took no interest in the proposed Bill, which was, however,\r\nintroduced and given a day for second reading in May, 1913, when it\r\nwas defeated by a majority of 47.\r\n\r\nThis discreditable series of incidents did far more harm to the\r\nGovernment than to the suffrage cause, as was very conclusively shown\r\nin the press. \"Punch,\" for instance, had a cartoon on Feb. 5, 1913,\r\nrepresenting a dance in which Mr. Asquith figured as a defaulting\r\npartner in a corner and trying to escape from an indignant woman who\r\nsaid, \"You've cut my dance!\" This was indicative of the general trend\r\nof public opinion.\r\n\r\nIn the previous year the N.U.W.S.S. had placed a new interpretation on\r\nits election policy. This was to support in elections irrespective of\r\nparty \"the best friend of Women's Suffrage.\" After the defeat of the\r\nConciliation Bill in 1912 when 42 so-called \"friends\" voted against\r\nit, we resolved in the future that the best friend was a man who was\r\nnot only personally satisfactory but who also belonged to a party\r\nwhich had made Women's Suffrage a plank in its platform. This meant\r\nsupport for the Labour Party and for the development of this policy we\r\nraised a special fund called the Election Fighting Fund and took\r\nactive steps in canvassing and speaking for Labour men whenever they\r\npresented themselves as candidates for vacant seats. Our movement had\r\nnow become the storm centre of English politics. A well known labour\r\nleader wrote of the political situation in February, 1913, as follows:\r\n\"The Women's Suffrage question will now dominate British politics\r\nuntil it is settled. It has within the last few weeks killed a great\r\nGovernment measure and it has done more than that. It has made it\r\nimpossible for this or any succeeding Liberal Government to deal with\r\nfranchise reform without giving votes to women. The Labour Party will\r\nsee to that.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1913 the N.U.W.S.S. organised the greatest public demonstration it\r\nhad ever made. We called it The Pilgrimage. It meant processions of\r\nnon-militant suffragists, wearing their badges and carrying banners,\r\nmarching towards London along eight of the great trunk roads. These\r\neight processions, many of them lasting several weeks, stopped at\r\ntowns and villages on their way, held meetings, distributed literature\r\nand collected funds. It was all a tremendous and unprecedented\r\nsuccess, well organised and well done throughout. (Described in detail\r\nin The Women's Victory.) The Pilgrimage made a very great impression\r\nand was favourably commented on in the organs of the press which had\r\nnever helped us before. We finished The Pilgrimage with a mass meeting\r\nin Hyde Park on July 26, where we had seventeen platforms, one for\r\neach of our federations. We asked Mr. Asquith and the leaders of other\r\npolitical parties to receive a deputation from The Pilgrimage the\r\nfollowing week. They all accepted with the exception of Mr. John\r\nRedmond. When Mr. Asquith received us his demeanor was far less\r\nunfriendly than it had ever been before. He admitted that the offer\r\nof a Private Member's Bill was no equivalent for the loss of a place\r\nin a Government Bill. He said: \"Proceed as you have been proceeding,\r\ncontinue to the end,\" and said if we could show that \"a substantial\r\nmajority of the country was favourable to Women's Suffrage, Parliament\r\nwould yield, as it had always hitherto done, to the opinion of the\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nIn May, 1914, suffrage ground was broken in the House of Lords by Lord\r\nSelborne and Lord Lytton, who introduced a bill on the lines of the\r\nConciliation Bill, the latter making one of the most powerful speeches\r\nin our support to which we had ever listened. The Bill was rejected by\r\n104 to 60, but we were more than satisfied by the weight of the\r\nspeeches on our side and by the effect produced by them. Another\r\nimportant event which greatly helped our movement in 1914 was the\r\nprotest of the National Trade Union Congress on February 12th against\r\nthe Government's failure to redeem its repeated pledges to women and\r\ndemanding \"a Government Reform Bill which must include the\r\nenfranchisement of women.\" This was followed by resolutions passed at\r\nthe annual conference of the National Labour Party re-affirming its\r\ndecision \"to oppose any further extension of the franchise to men in\r\nwhich women were not included.\"\r\n\r\nThere must, according to law, have been a General Election in 1915 and\r\nthe remarkable progress of the women's cause made us feel confident\r\nthat a Parliament would be elected deeply pledged to our support. Our\r\nfriends were being elected and our enemies, including that worst type\r\nof enemy, the false friend and the so-called Liberal afraid of his own\r\nprinciples, were being rejected at by-elections in a manner that\r\nforeshadowed a great gain to suffrage forces at the General Election.\r\nThen suddenly, destroying all our hopes of success and jeopardizing\r\nthe very existence of representative government and all forms of\r\ndemocracy throughout the world, came the outbreak of war; the entry of\r\nour own country and the resulting concentration of the vast majority\r\nof the British people, whether men or women, in the gigantic national\r\neffort which the successful resistance of such a foe demanded. August\r\n4, 1914, was a heart-breaking day for us. Nevertheless, suffragists\r\nfrom the first faced the facts and saw clearly what their duty was.\r\nThe \"militants\" instantly abandoned every sort of violence. A large\r\nnumber of the more active members of their societies formed the\r\nWomen's Emergency Corps, who were ready to undertake all kinds of\r\nnational work which the exigencies of the situation demanded. The\r\nN.U.W.S.S. Executive Committee meeting on August 3, the day before our\r\nown country was actually involved, resolved to suspend immediately all\r\npolitical propaganda for its own ends. Under normal circumstances we\r\nshould have summoned a Council meeting to discuss the situation and to\r\ndetermine the course to be taken by the Union. This being impossible\r\nowing to difficulties connected with railway communication we\r\nconsulted our societies, then numbering over 500, by post, placing\r\nthem in possession of our own views, viz.: that ordinary political\r\nwork would have to be suspended during the war and suggesting that our\r\nbest course would be to use our staff and organising capacity in\r\npromoting forms of work designed to mitigate the distress caused by\r\nthe war. We felt that our members would desire to be of service to the\r\nNation and that the N.U.W.S.S. had in their organisation a special\r\ngift which they could offer to their country. This view was endorsed\r\nby our societies with only two dissenting.\r\n\r\nOn receiving this practically unanimous backing we further proceeded\r\nto recommend distinct forms of active service. The Local Government\r\nBoard had addressed a circular to Lord Mayors and Mayors and Chairmen\r\nof Town and County Councils directing them at once to form Local\r\nRelief Committees to deal with any kind of distress caused by the war.\r\nWe suggested to our societies that they should offer their services to\r\nhelp, each in its own district, in this national work. We also opened\r\nin different parts of the country forty workrooms in which women\r\nthrown out of work by the war found employment. We established bureaux\r\nfor the registration of voluntary workers and gradually our work\r\nspread in all directions; help for the Belgian refugees, the starting\r\nof clubs and canteens for soldiers and sailors, clubs for soldiers'\r\nwives, work in connection with the Sailors' and Soldiers' Families\r\nAssociation, patrol work in the neighborhood of soldiers' training\r\ncamps, Red Cross work, conducting French classes for our men in\r\ntraining. A very large number of our societies concentrated on\r\nmaternity and child welfare work; others in country districts took up\r\nfruit picking and preserving in order to conserve the national food\r\nsupplies. It is really impossible to mention all our various\r\nactivities. These were included under a general heading adopted at a\r\nProvincial Council meeting held in November, 1914, urging \"our\r\nsocieties and all members of the Union to continue by every means in\r\ntheir power all efforts which had for their object the sustaining of\r\nthe vital energies of the Nation so long as such special efforts may\r\nbe required.\"\r\n\r\nThe war work with which the name of the N.U.W.S.S. is most widely\r\nknown was the formation of the Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign\r\nService. This was initiated and organised by the Hon. Sec. of our\r\nScottish Federation, Dr. Elsie Inglis, and was backed by the whole of\r\nthe N.U.W.S.S. (See Life of Dr. E. Inglis by Lady Frances Balfour.)\r\nMeeting at first with persistent snubbing from the Royal Army Medical\r\nCorps and the British Red Cross, Dr. Inglis formed her first hospital\r\nat the Abbaye de Royaument about thirty miles from Paris, officered\r\nentirely by women. Other units on similar lines quickly followed in\r\nFrance and Serbia. Their work was magnificent and was rapidly\r\nrecognised as such by the military authorities and by all who came in\r\ncontact with it. These hospitals probably produced by the example of\r\ntheir high standard of professional efficiency and personal devotion a\r\npermanent influence on the development of the women's movement in\r\nthose countries where they were located. They received no farthing of\r\ngovernment money but raised the 428,856 pounds, which their audited\r\naccounts show as their net total to August 3, 1919, entirely by\r\nprivate subscription from all over the world including, of course, the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe N.U.W.S.S. were very early in the field of women's national work\r\nduring the war because their members were already organised and\r\naccustomed to work together, but it is no exaggeration to say that the\r\nwhole of the women of the country of all classes, suffragist and\r\nanti-suffragist, threw themselves into work for the nation in a way\r\nthat had never been anticipated by those who had judged women by\r\npre-war standards. Into munition work and all kinds of manufacturing\r\nactivity they crowded in their thousands. They worked on the land and\r\nundertook many kinds of labour that had hitherto been supposed to be\r\nbeyond their strength and capacity. By what was called the Treasury\r\nagreement of 1915 the Trade Unions were induced to suspend the\r\noperation of their rules excluding the employment of female labour.\r\nThey bargained that women should be paid the same as men for the same\r\noutput and the Government agreed not to use the women as a reservoir\r\nof cheap labour. Thus industrial liberty was ensured for women at\r\nleast so long as the war should last.\r\n\r\nAll these things combined to produce an enormous effect on public\r\nopinion. Newspapers were full of the praises of women; financiers,\r\nstatesmen, economists and politicians declared that without the aid of\r\nwomen it would be impossible to win the war. The anti-suffragism of\r\nMr. Asquith even was beginning to crumble. In speaking of the heroic\r\ndeath of Edith Cavell in Belgium in October, 1915, he said: \"She has\r\ntaught the bravest men among us a supreme lesson of courage; yes ...\r\nand there are thousands of such women and a year ago we did not know\r\nit.\" Almost the whole of the press was on our side. The general tone\r\nwas that it would be difficult to refuse woman a voice in the control\r\nof affairs after the splendid way in which she had justified her claim\r\nto it. We old suffragists felt that we were living in a new world\r\nwhere everyone agreed with us. Nevertheless, I do not believe we\r\nshould have won the vote just when we did if it had not been that,\r\nthrough the action of the Government itself, it was absolutely\r\nnecessary to introduce legislation in order to prevent the almost\r\ntotal disfranchisement of many millions of men who had been serving\r\ntheir country abroad in the Navy and Army, or in munition or other\r\nwork which had withdrawn them from the places where they usually\r\nresided.\r\n\r\nIt may be necessary to explain to non-British readers that by far the\r\nmost important qualification for the Parliamentary franchise in this\r\ncountry before 1918 was the occupation of premises, and before a man\r\ncould be put on the register of voters it was necessary for its owner\r\nto prove \"occupation\" of these premises for twelve months previous to\r\nthe last 15th of July. Seven out of every eight voters were placed on\r\nthe register through this qualification. It was not a property\r\nqualification, for the tiniest cottage at a shilling a week could\r\nqualify its occupier for a vote if he had fulfilled the condition just\r\ndescribed; and a man might be a millionaire without getting a vote if\r\nhe were not in occupation of qualifying premises. Before the war the\r\nregister of voters was kept up to date by annual revision. The war,\r\nhowever, made this difficult and the Government in 1915 gave\r\ndirections that this annual revision should be abandoned. As the war\r\nwent on, the existing register, therefore, rapidly became more and\r\nmore out of date. Millions of the best men in the country had become\r\ndisqualified through their war service by giving up their qualifying\r\npremises. The House of Commons again and again postponed the date of\r\nthe General Election but the occasional by-elections which took place\r\nproved that there was no register in existence on which it would be\r\nmorally possible to appeal to the country. The old, the feeble, the\r\nslacker, the crank, the conscientious objector would all be left in\r\nfull strength and the fighting men would be disfranchised. A\r\nParliament elected on such a register would, Mr. Asquith declared, be\r\nwholly lacking in moral authority. Therefore, by sheer necessity the\r\nGovernment was forced to introduce legislation dealing with the whole\r\nfranchise question as it affected the male voter. A Coalition\r\nGovernment of the Liberal, Conservative and Labour Parties had been\r\nformed in 1915. This improved suffrage prospects, for many of the new\r\nmen joining the Government, more especially Lord Robert Cecil, the\r\nEarl of Selborne and the Earl of Lytton, were warm supporters of our\r\ncause; while in making room for these newscomers, Mr. Asquith found it\r\npossible to dispense with the services of men of the type of Sir\r\nCharles Hobhouse, Mr. A. J. Pease and others who were our opponents.\r\nThe formation of a Coalition Government helped us in another way.\r\nNeither of the great parties, Conservative and Liberal, had been\r\nunanimous on the women's question and the heads of these parties lived\r\nin terror of smashing up their party by pledging themselves to\r\ndefinite action on our side. Mr. Gladstone had broken up the Liberal\r\nParty in 1886 by advocating Irish Home Rule, and Mr. Balfour and Mr.\r\nChamberlain had broken up the Conservative Party by advocating\r\nProtection in 1903-4. Each of these had, in consequence, a prolonged\r\nsojourn in the wilderness of Opposition. But now a Government was\r\nformed in which all the parties were represented except the Irish\r\nNationalists, who had refused to join, and therefore our friends in\r\nboth the old parties could give free rein to their disposition to make\r\nWomen's Suffrage a reality without dread of bringing disaster on their\r\norganisations. The attitude of the N.U.W.S.S. and seventeen other\r\nConstitutional Suffrage Societies who had united to form a\r\nConsultative Committee, was quite clear as to the line we should take\r\nunder these circumstances. In various ways and by repeated\r\ncommunications, letters, memorials and deputations we kept the\r\nGovernment informed that if their intentions with regard to the new\r\nregister were limited simply to replacing upon it the names of the men\r\nwho had lost their vote through their patriotic service, we should not\r\npress our own claim; but if on the other hand the Government\r\ndetermined to proceed by creating a new basis for the franchise, or\r\nchanging the law in any way which would result in the addition of a\r\nlarge number of men to the register, without doing anything for women,\r\nwe should use every means in our power within the limits of lawful\r\nagitation to bring the case for the enfranchisement of women before\r\nParliament and the country.\r\n\r\nMr. Asquith answered a communication from us on these lines in May,\r\n1916, with the greatest politeness but said that \"no such legislation\r\nwas at present in contemplation.\" However, within the next fortnight\r\nit was in contemplation and the Government made repeated attempts to\r\ndeal with the situation by the creation of a special register. All the\r\nattempts were rejected by the House of Commons, which evidently wanted\r\nthe subject dealt with on broader and more comprehensive lines. On\r\nAugust 14 Mr. Asquith, in introducing yet another Special Register\r\nBill, announced his conversion to Women's Suffrage! This was an advent\r\nof great importance to our movement, for it virtually made the Liberal\r\nParty a Suffrage Party, but the Parliamentary difficulty was not\r\nremoved, for the Government was still nibbling at the question by\r\ntrying to deal with it by little amendments to the law relating to\r\nthe registration of voters. At last a way out was devised. Mr. Walter\r\nLong, president of the local government board, a typical conservative\r\ncountry gentleman and at that time an anti-suffragist, made the\r\nsuggestion that the whole question of Electoral Reform, including the\r\nenfranchisement of women, should be referred to a non-party\r\nConference, consisting of members of both Houses of Parliament and\r\npresided over by the Speaker. Mr. Asquith concurred and Parliament\r\nagreed. Women's Suffrage was only one of many subjects connected with\r\nElectoral Reform which had to be dealt with by the Conference but it\r\nis not too much to say that if it had not been for the urgency of the\r\nclaim of women to representation the Conference would never have been\r\nbrought into existence.\r\n\r\nThe members of this Conference were chosen by the Speaker, who was\r\ncareful to give equal representation to suffragists and\r\nanti-suffragists. Sir John Simon and Sir Willoughby Dickinson, members\r\nof the Conference, were very active and skilful in organising the\r\nforces in our favour. The Conference was called into being in October,\r\n1916, and began its sittings at once. A ministerial crisis which\r\noccurred in December resulted in the resignation of Mr. Asquith and\r\nthe appointment of Mr. Lloyd George as his successor. The Speaker\r\nenquired of the new Prime Minister if he desired the Conference to\r\ncontinue its labours. The reply was an emphatic affirmative. The\r\nConference reported on January 27, 1917. Everyone knows that it\r\nrecommended by a majority, some said a large majority, the granting of\r\nsome measure of suffrage to women. Put as briefly as possible the\r\nfranchise recommended for women was \"household franchise,\" and for the\r\npurposes of the bill a woman was reckoned to be a householder not only\r\nif she was so in her own right but if she were the wife of a\r\nhouseholder. An age limit of thirty was imposed upon women, not\r\nbecause it was in any way logical or reasonable but simply and solely\r\nin order to produce a constituency in which the men were not\r\nout-numbered by the women.\r\n\r\nSome few weeks earlier we had heard on unimpeachable authority that\r\nthe new Prime Minister was \"very keen and very practical\" on our\r\nquestion and was prepared to introduce legislation upon it without\r\ndelay. He no doubt remembered how emphatically he had told us in 1911\r\nof the extreme value of the promises which had been made to us by Mr.\r\nAsquith, and how in our meeting in the Albert Hall in the following\r\nMarch he had referred to the doubt which some suffragists had\r\nexpressed upon the worth of these promises as \"an imputation of deep\r\ndishonour which he absolutely declined to contemplate.\" He had in 1911\r\nput into writing and sent as a message to the _Common Cause_, the\r\nofficial organ of the N.U.W.S.S., a statement of his conviction that\r\nMr. Asquith's promises made the carrying of a Women's Suffrage\r\namendment to next year's franchise bill a certainty and he had offered\r\nhis personal help to bring this about. It has already been described\r\nhow all these confident hopes had been brought to nought; but now,\r\nDecember, 1916, within a fortnight of becoming Prime Minister, Mr.\r\nLloyd George let us know that he was not only ready but keen to go\r\nforward on practical lines. When Parliament met we asked the Prime\r\nMinister to receive a large and representative deputation of women who\r\nhad worked for their country during the war. Our object was to ask him\r\nto legislate at once on the lines recommended by the Speaker's\r\nConference but we were pushing an open door.\r\n\r\nThe new Prime Minister had arranged to receive us on March 29, 1917,\r\nand on the 28th Mr. Asquith had moved a resolution in the House of\r\nCommons, and his motion had been agreed to by 341 votes to 62, calling\r\nfor the early introduction of legislation based on the recommendations\r\nof the Speaker's Conference. When our deputation waited on Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge the following day he was able to inform us that he had already\r\ninstructed the Government draftsman to draw up a bill on these lines.\r\nThe debate in the House on March 28 had turned mainly on Women's\r\nSuffrage and the immense majority in support of Mr. Asquith's motion\r\nwas rightly regarded as a suffrage triumph. Every leader of every\r\nparty in the House of Commons had taken part in the debate and had\r\nexpressed his support of the enfranchisement of women. The Government\r\nwhips had not been put on and throughout the debates which followed\r\nthe Bill was not treated as a Government but as a House of Commons\r\nmeasure. The victory, therefore, was all the more welcome to us\r\nbecause it was the result of a free vote of the House. Mr. Asquith's\r\nretraction of his former errors was quite handsome. He said, among\r\nother things, that his \"eyes which for years in this matter had been\r\nclouded by fallacies and sealed by illusions at last had been opened\r\nto the truth.\" It required a European War on the vastest scale that\r\nthe world had ever known to shake him out of his fallacies and\r\nillusions, and many of us felt that it would have been better if a\r\nless terrible convulsion had sufficed to awaken him, but still, now he\r\nwas awakened, he was prompt in owning he had been in the wrong and\r\ntherefore no more was to be said. The subsequent stages of this\r\nRepresentation of the People Bill were a series of triumphs for the\r\nsuffrage cause. The second reading debate was taken on May 22d and 23d\r\nand again turned almost entirely on the women's question; the majority\r\nwas 329 to 40. When the Bill was in Committee and the clauses\r\nenfranchising women were taken up on June 19 the majority was 385 to\r\n55, or exactly seven to one. On June 20 a last division was made, when\r\nthe number of anti-suffragists was only 17.\r\n\r\nOur friends in the Speaker's Conference had so often impressed on us\r\nthe danger of departing, even in the direction of obvious improvement,\r\nfrom its recommendations that we had carefully abstained from urging\r\nany deviation from them; but when the immense majorities just quoted\r\nshowed that the Bill and our clauses in it were safe beyond a\r\nperadventure, we did press very strongly that the same principle\r\nshould be applied to Municipal suffrage for women which had already\r\nbeen sanctioned by the House for the Parliamentary Suffrage, namely,\r\nthat the wives of householders should be recognized as householders,\r\nwhich would entitle them to vote. On November 15 an amendment to this\r\neffect was moved but was not accepted by the Government. There were\r\nvigorous protests in our favour from all parts of the House and the\r\ndebate on it was adjourned. During the interval the N.U.W.S.S. and\r\nother societies with whom we were cooperating bombarded the leader of\r\nthe House and the Minister in charge of the bill with letters and\r\ntelegrams in support of the amendment. These produced a good effect\r\nand on November 20, Government opposition having been withdrawn, the\r\namendment was agreed to without a division. Thus without the existence\r\nof a single woman voter but on the strength of her coming into\r\nexistence within the next few months, the women on the Municipal\r\nregisters of Great Britain and Ireland were increased in number from\r\nabout one million to over eight-and-a-half millions. And yet Lord\r\nBryce and the other anti-suffragists assured us that the vote would\r\nmake no difference!\r\n\r\nIn the House of Commons a third reading of the Representation of the\r\nPeople Bill was taken on December 7 without a division. The Bill was\r\nnow safely through the Commons but its passage through the Lords had\r\nyet to be undertaken. The second reading debate began on December 17\r\nand lasted two days. No one could predict what would happen; Lord\r\nCurzon, president of the Anti-Suffrage League, was leader of the House\r\nand chief representative of the Government. The Lord Chancellor [Lord\r\nFinlay], who is in the chair in House of Lords' debates, was an\r\nenvenomed opponent. Among other influential Peers whom we knew as our\r\nenemies were Lord Lansdowne, Lord Halsbury, Lord Balfour of Burleigh\r\nand Lord Bryce. On the other hand we could count on the support of\r\nLord Selborne, Lord Lytton, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop\r\nof London, Lord Courtney and Lord Milner. We looked forward to the\r\ndebate and the divisions in the Lords with considerable trepidation.\r\nThe Lords have no constituents, they have no seats to fight for and\r\ndefend. It is therefore impossible to influence them by any\r\nelectioneering arts but we sent to all the Peers a carefully worded\r\nand influentially signed memorandum setting forth the chief facts and\r\narguments in our favour. The second reading of the Bill was taken in\r\nthe Lords without a division, the most important speech against it\r\nbeing Lord Bryce's; he insisted again and again that the possession of\r\na vote made no difference. Lord Sydenham had the courage (!) to assert\r\nthat the suffrage movement had made no progress in America, and, while\r\nadmitting that it had lately been adopted in the State of New York, no\r\ndoubt thought that he was giving a fair description when he said: \"In\r\nAmerica ... fourteen States have refused the franchise to women and\r\ntwo, Montana and Nevada, have granted it. The population of the\r\nfourteen States is 43,000,000 and that of the two States is 500,000.\"\r\n(Twelve States had fully enfranchised their women.)\r\n\r\nThe real fight in the House of Lords began on Jan. 8, 1918, when the\r\ncommittee stage was reached. The debate lasted three days and on\r\nClause IV, which enfranchised women, Lord Selborne made an\r\nextraordinarily powerful and eloquent speech in its favour. The House\r\nwas filled and the excitement on both sides was intense. As we were\r\nsitting crowded in the small pen allotted to ladies not Peeresses in\r\nthe Upper House on January 10th we received a cable saying the House\r\nof Representatives in Washington had accepted the Women's Suffrage\r\nAmendment to the Federal Constitution by the necessary two-thirds\r\nmajority. This we hailed as a good omen. No one knew what Lord\r\nSydenham thought of it! The most exciting moment was when Lord Curzon\r\nrose to close the debate. The first part of his speech was devoted to\r\na description of the disasters which he believed would follow from the\r\nadoption of women's franchise but the second part was occupied by\r\ngiving very good reasons for not voting against it. He reminded their\r\nLordships of the immense majorities by which it had been supported in\r\nthe House of Commons, by majorities in every party \"including those to\r\nwhich most of your Lordships belong.... Your Lordships can vote as you\r\nplease; you can cut this clause out of the Bill--you have a perfect\r\nright to do so--but if you think that by killing the clause you can\r\nalso save the Bill, I believe you to be mistaken.... The House of\r\nCommons will return it to you with the clause re-inserted. Will you be\r\nprepared to put it back?...\" Before he sat down Lord Curzon announced\r\nhis intention of not voting at all, for the reason that if he had done\r\notherwise he \"might be accused of having precipitated a conflict from\r\nwhich your Lordships could not emerge with credit.\" The division was\r\ntaken almost immediately after the conclusion of this speech. Both of\r\nthe Archbishops and the twelve Bishops present voted for the bill. Our\r\nclause was carried by 134 votes to 71, and Women's Suffrage was,\r\ntherefore, supported in the Lords by nearly two to one. The Lords\r\ninserted in it among other things Proportional Representation. It was\r\non this and not on women's suffrage that the final contest took place\r\nwhen it was returned to the Commons, but at last the long struggle of\r\nwomen for free citizenship was ended, having continued a little over\r\nfifty years. The huge majorities by which we had won in the House of\r\nCommons had afforded our ship deep water enough to float safely over\r\nthe rocks and reefs of the House of Lords. The Royal Assent was given\r\non Feb. 6, 1918.\r\n\r\nThe first election at which women voted was held on December 14. Our\r\nfriends in the Speaker's Conference had aimed at producing a\r\nconstituency numbering roughly about 10,000,000 men and 6,000,000\r\nwomen. The actual numbers of both sexes enfranchised by the Act of\r\n1918 turned out to be considerably in excess of this calculation. A\r\nParliamentary return published in November, 1918, showed the following\r\nnumbers of men and women on the register.\r\n\r\n                                  _Men._\r\n                                12,913,166\r\n  Naval and Military Voters      3,896,763\r\n                                16,809,929\r\n\r\n                                 _Women._\r\n                                 8,479,156\r\n  Naval and Military Voters          3,372\r\n                                 8,482,528\r\n\r\nAt the annual Council meeting of the National Union of Women's\r\nSuffrage Societies held in March, 1918, its object was changed by\r\nformal vote. It was no longer necessary to concentrate on Women's\r\nSuffrage and we adopted as our object \"To obtain all such reforms as\r\nare necessary to secure a real equality of liberties, status and\r\nopportunities between men and women.\" No change of name was made until\r\nthe following year when a revised constitution was adopted and the\r\nname was modified in accordance with our present object. We have now\r\nbecome the National Union of Societies for Equal Citizenship and we\r\nhope that the letters N. U. S. E. C. will soon become as familiar and\r\nas dear to our members as N. U. W. S. S. were in the old days. At the\r\nsame meeting I retired from the presidency and my friend and\r\ncolleague, Miss Eleanor Rathbone, was elected in my place.\r\n\r\n[216] In 1907 Acts of parliament for England, Wales and Scotland (and\r\none for Ireland in 1911) made women eligible as members of Town,\r\nCounty, Burgh and Borough Councils and as chairmen of these bodies,\r\nincluding the right to be Mayors and Provosts, Aldermen and Baillies,\r\nwith the limitation that women appointed to an office carrying with it\r\nthe right to be Justices of the Peace should be incapacitated from so\r\nacting. These Acts though non-contentious in the party sense required\r\nfourteen years' strenuous work to secure their adoption as Government\r\nmeasures. This was achieved during Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman's\r\npremiership, the necessary legislation being announced in the King's\r\nSpeech as part of the Government programme.\r\n\r\nIn 1918 the Qualification of Women Act for the United Kingdom made\r\nwomen eligible to the House of Commons. The Bill passed almost without\r\nopposition through both Houses and became law in the week ending\r\nNovember 16. As the General Election took place on December 14 there\r\nwas little time for preparation, nevertheless, there were seventeen\r\nwomen candidates and one, the Countess Makievicz, a Sinn Feiner, was\r\nelected but refused to take her seat. The fact that her husband was a\r\nforeigner made it doubtful whether she would have been allowed to do\r\nso, though an Irishwoman by birth. In 1919 Viscountess Astor was\r\nelected for Plymouth.\r\n\r\nIn 1919 the Sex Disqualification Removal Act for the United Kingdom\r\nwent some way but not the whole way towards the fulfilment of the\r\npledge given by the Coalition Government of Mr. Lloyd George in\r\nDecember, 1918, \"to remove existing inequalities in the law as between\r\nmen and women.\" A much more complete bill had been introduced by the\r\nLabour Party early in the session, which passed through all its stages\r\nin the House of Commons notwithstanding Government opposition but was\r\ndefeated in the House of Lords and the Government changeling\r\nsubstituted. This Act, though it did not give women the parliamentary\r\nvote on the same terms as men nor admit them to the civil service on\r\nequal terms, and though the clause specifically conferring on them\r\neligibility to the House of Lords was cut out, contained,\r\nnevertheless, important provisions in the direction of equality. It\r\nallowed them to sit on juries, be Justices of the Peace, sworn in as\r\npolice officers, enter the legal profession and made it possible for\r\nthe Universities of Oxford and Cambridge to admit women to membership\r\nand degrees on equal terms with men.\r\n\r\nThe only important advance in education after 1900 was the throwing\r\nopen to women by the Governing Body of Trinity College, Dublin, of\r\ndegrees, membership and all privileges pertaining thereto in 1903. All\r\nthe universities in the United Kingdom, with the exception of Oxford\r\nand Cambridge, have been for many years open to women and in November,\r\n1919, a Royal Commission was appointed to enquire into their financial\r\nresources and into the administration and application of these\r\nresources. On the commission, Miss Penrose of Somerville College,\r\nOxford, and Miss B. A. Clough of Newnham College, Cambridge, the\r\nwomen's colleges, were appointed as members. An Act of Parliament\r\nlater enabled both universities to grant membership, degrees and all\r\nprivileges to women. Oxford availed itself of these powers without\r\ndelay. Cambridge in December, 1920, refused to do so by a large vote,\r\nbut it will ultimately have to open its doors.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[215] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Millicent\r\nGarrett Fawcett, J.P., LL.D., who has been prominently connected with\r\nthe movement for women's suffrage in Great Britain for nearly fifty\r\nyears and was President of the National Association from 1904, when it\r\nwas re-organized, until after the victory was won in 1918.\r\n\r\n[216] Accompanying this chapter was a complete list of laws in the\r\ninterest of women enacted by the Parliament beginning in 1902,\r\nprepared by Miss Chrystal Macmillan, M.A., B.Sc. The lack of space\r\nwhich has compelled the omission of similar laws from all of the State\r\nchapters makes it necessary in this one. Three of importance\r\npolitically are given.--Ed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nWOMAN SUFFRAGE IN BRITISH COLONIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn granting the complete franchise to a part of her women in 1918\r\nGreat Britain followed all of her self-governing colonies, which, with\r\nthe exception of South Africa, had given the full suffrage on the same\r\nterms as exercised by men. New Zealand, Australia and Canada gave\r\nMunicipal suffrage at early dates, extending from 1867 in New South\r\nWales to 1894 in the Northwest Territories of Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW ZEALAND.\r\n\r\nNew Zealand was the first country in the world to give full suffrage\r\nto women, its Parliament in 1893 conferring the franchise on all\r\npersons over 21. In case of women, however, this did not include the\r\nright to sit in Parliament, and, although efforts to secure this right\r\nwere made at intervals during all the following years, the bill for it\r\nseveral times passing the Lower House, they were not successful until\r\n1919. The unvarying record has been that the registration and vote of\r\nwomen have nearly averaged those of men and in some instances have\r\nexceeded them. In the election of 1919 the registration of men was\r\n355,000; of women, 328,320. New Zealand is noted for its advanced\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUSTRALIA.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 the six States of Australia federated in a commonwealth with a\r\nNational Parliament and one of its earliest acts in June, 1902, was to\r\nconfer the complete universal suffrage on women and eligibility to\r\nthis body. About 800,000 women were thus enfranchised. This action had\r\nbeen preceded by the granting of the State suffrage by the\r\nLegislatures in South Australia in 1894 and in West Australia in 1899\r\nand this was done in New South Wales in August, 1902. Women received\r\nthe State suffrage in Tasmania and Queensland in 1905, Victoria in\r\n1908. South Australia was the only one that gave the right to sit in\r\nthe Legislature with the State suffrage. This eligibility was not\r\nconferred until 1919 in New South Wales and Victoria; 1920 in West\r\nAustralia and does not yet exist in Tasmania and Queensland. One must\r\nbe a property owner to be a municipal voter or office holder.\r\n\r\nAustralia has largely substituted advanced legislation for women for\r\nthe English Common Law. The statistics relating to the voting of women\r\nfollow closely those of New Zealand. There never has been a proposal\r\nto take away the political privileges of women, which could be done by\r\nan Act of Parliament. On the contrary during the years when the\r\ncontest for woman suffrage was being carried on in Great Britain its\r\nParliament was more than once urged by that of Australia to grant it.\r\nIn 1917, when the struggle was at its height, the strongest possible\r\nmemorial was adopted by the National Parliament of Australia, which\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     Appreciating the blessings of self-government in Australia\r\n     through adult suffrage, and appreciating the desire of Your\r\n     Majesty's Government to vindicate the claims of the small nations\r\n     to self-government, we are confident that Your Majesty will\r\n     recognize the justice of the same claim in the case of the small\r\n     nation of women in Your Majesty's kingdom--women who, in this\r\n     great crisis in the history of the British Empire ... have proved\r\n     themselves as worthy soldiers as those on the battlefield, and as\r\n     worthy of the protection of the ballot, which is conceded to\r\n     men.... We are deeply interested in the welfare of the women of\r\n     the Empire and we again humbly petition Your Majesty to endow\r\n     them with that right of self-government for which they have\r\n     petitioned for nearly three-quarters of a century.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent statesmen of Australia and New Zealand in their\r\nvisits to Great Britain, Canada and the United States have given\r\ntestimony as to the benefits of woman suffrage.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMINION OF CANADA.\r\n\r\nWhen Volume IV of this History was written in 1900 four pages sufficed\r\nfor an account of woman suffrage in Canada. It was confined to a\r\nMunicipal or School franchise or both in the Provinces for widows and\r\nspinsters, and in some of them married women were included. This\r\nprivilege began in Ontario in 1884 and the situation remained\r\nunchanged until 1916, when the World War, which brought the full\r\nenfranchisement of women in many countries, began to have its effect\r\nin Canada. For the large amount of valuable material from which the\r\nfollowing brief résumé is made the History is indebted to Dr. Augusta\r\nStowe Gullen, a leader of the woman suffrage movement. Its foundation\r\nwas laid in 1878 and following years by the mother of Dr. Gullen, the\r\npioneer woman physician, Dr. Emily Howard Stowe, a friend and\r\ncontemporary of Susan B. Anthony[217]. Dr. Stowe was a founder and the\r\nfirst president of the Dominion Women's Enfranchisement Association,\r\nwhich secured many privileges for women.\r\n\r\nThe first woman suffrage society was organized in 1883 in the city\r\ncouncil chamber of Toronto with the Mayor in the chair. Mrs. Donald\r\nMcEwan was made president and other officers were Dr. Stowe, Miss Mary\r\nMcDonnell and Dr. James L. Hughes, afterwards Inspector of Schools.\r\nPetitions were sent to the Dominion Parliament and bills presented but\r\nwhen in the late 90's the Electoral Act was changed to make the\r\nvoters' list for its members coincide with the lists in the Provinces,\r\nthe latter became in a large measure the battle ground, although the\r\nefforts for a national law were not discontinued. The movement for\r\nProhibition had a strong influence in the granting of woman suffrage\r\nin the Provinces and it was hastened by the splendid war work of the\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nThe first Provincial Legislature to enfranchise women was that of\r\nManitoba, Jan 27, 1916. A convention of the Woman's Christian\r\nTemperance Union as early as July, 1902, passed a resolution to press\r\nthe work for it and later in the year the Labor Party endorsed equal\r\nsuffrage through its paper, _The Voice_, and its officers affiliated\r\nwith the suffrage club. Dr. Amelia Yeomans was a devoted worker. In\r\n1906 when there was a prospect that the Municipal vote would be taken\r\naway from married women property owners, the Liberal party convention\r\nmade its retention a plank in their platform but the Conservative\r\nLegislature abolished it. In 1907 it was restored. In 1913 the women\r\nsucceeded in getting a full suffrage bill before one House of the\r\nLegislature, which was defeated by 21 to 14 votes. The next year the\r\nLiberal Party pledged itself to give the complete franchise if it won\r\nthe election. It did so and the women rolled up a big petition as a\r\nbacking. Premier Norris and the Cabinet supported the bill. The\r\nExecutive Board of the Political Equality League were invited to seats\r\non the floor of the House the day of the third reading and the bill\r\ngiving women equal suffrage and eligibility was passed amid great\r\nenthusiasm by unanimous vote.\r\n\r\nThe suffragists of Alberta began extensive work in 1910 to have the\r\nMunicipal franchise possessed by widows and spinsters extended to\r\nmarried women and the agitation was continued to include the full\r\nsuffrage. Following the example of Manitoba Premier A. L. Sifton\r\nannounced on Feb. 24, 1916, before the Legislature opened, that the\r\nGovernment would introduce a woman suffrage bill of the widest scope.\r\nThe bill passed in Alberta in March with the full approval of press\r\nand people and the suffragists met at once in the home of Mrs. Nellie\r\nMcClung at Edmonton to arrange for taking up their new duties. Mrs. O.\r\nC. Edwards had been a ceaseless worker here and in Saskatchewan. In\r\n1914 the first woman Judge in Canada, Mrs. Jamieson, president of the\r\nLocal Council of Women of Calgary, was appointed by the Attorney\r\nGeneral as Commissioner of the Juvenile Court. In February, 1918, two\r\nwomen, Mrs. L. M. McKinney and Miss Roberta McAdams, a Lieutenant on\r\nthe staff of the Canadian military hospital in Orpington, Kent, were\r\nelected to the Legislature, the first women legislators in the British\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 the women of Saskatchewan sent in petitions, some of them\r\nendorsed by city councils, asking Municipal suffrage for married\r\nwomen, but the Government refused it. In opening the Legislature on\r\nMar. 14, 1916, Lieutenant Governor Lake said: \"In future years the one\r\noutstanding feature of your program will be the full enfranchisement\r\nof women.\" The suffragists of the Province had been organized about\r\nfive years and the president of the Franchise Board, Mrs. F. A.\r\nLawton, had presented to Premier Scott a petition signed by 10,000\r\nnames to show that public sentiment was in favor of this action. He\r\nanswered that he could give them a definite answer and, as he had\r\nalready announced, their request would be granted. He said that\r\nalthough Manitoba had been the first to give women the suffrage those\r\nof Saskatchewan would be the first to have a chance to use it. At an\r\nearly and full meeting of the Legislature a number of members spoke in\r\nfavor of it and it passed practically without opposition. In 1919 Mrs.\r\nM. O. Ramsden was elected to the Legislature.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 a petition for woman suffrage was presented to the Government\r\nin British Columbia and refused. Another effort was made in 1903 but\r\nthe subject was not brought before the Legislature until 1906, when it\r\ndefeated a bill. In 1908 it took away the Municipal franchise from\r\nwomen householders. The women's clubs in Victoria secured 1,000 names\r\nin three days protesting against this action. Mr. Naden, Liberal\r\nmember from Greenwood, introduced a bill restoring it, supported by\r\nhis party, but it was defeated. The Council of Women, at its November\r\nmeeting, adopted a resolution \"to do all in its power to promote the\r\nwoman suffrage cause.\" It was the first Local Council in Canada to\r\nendorse this cause and later held two public meetings in its interest.\r\nIn 1910 extensive work was done to regain the Municipal franchise. In\r\n1911 nine important amendments to the very reprehensible laws\r\nconcerning women and children were submitted to the Legislature by the\r\nCouncil through the Attorney General and one was passed. In the autumn\r\nthe Political Equality Club was re-organized in Victoria, Mrs. Gordon\r\nGrant, president, and in December at a Provincial Conference in\r\nVancouver she assisted in organizing one there; Mrs. Lashley Hall,\r\npresident--later Mrs. C. Townley--and Miss Lily Laverock, secretary.\r\nThe two societies organized a large deputation to wait upon the\r\nAttorney General and solicit better property laws for women, equal\r\nguardianship of children for mothers, the right taken away from\r\nfathers to dispose of their guardianship by will and other equally\r\nneeded laws. They also memorialized the Legislature for the full\r\nProvincial suffrage for women. On Feb. 15, 1913, fifty women in the\r\nProvince presented a petition of 10,000 names to the Premier, asking\r\nthat suffrage on equal terms with men be given to women and on the\r\n19th he answered that as a matter of Government policy it was\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThe agitation increased and continued until the full enfranchisement\r\nof women in the three great Provinces to the east brought the\r\nquestion to a climax. Even then, however, it was not allowed to be\r\nsettled by the Legislature, as it had been in those Provinces, but on\r\nApril 14, 1916, Premier Bowser stated that the Elections Act, which\r\nprovided for allowing a vote to soldiers over 18, would include women\r\nand would be submitted to a referendum of the electors. This was done\r\nby the Legislature, which met May 31, and the election took place\r\nSeptember 15. The amendment was carried by an immense majority in\r\nevery district, about two to one, and later this was increased by the\r\nlarge favorable majority of the absent soldiers, who were entitled to\r\nvote. It went into effect March 1, 1917. The area of Canadian\r\nterritory in which women were now enfranchised extended from Ontario\r\nto the Pacific Ocean. In 1919 Mrs. Ralph Smith, widow of the Minister\r\nof Finance, was elected to the Legislature and in 1921 she was made\r\nSpeaker, the first instance on record.\r\n\r\nThe struggle for woman suffrage in Canada was now centered in the\r\nProvince of Ontario, where it began in 1883, and it was largely\r\ncarried on during much of the time by the Dominion Women's\r\nEnfranchisement Association, which had been incorporated in 1889. Dr.\r\nAugusta Stowe Gullen became its president in 1903, after the death of\r\nher mother, Dr. Emily Howard Stowe, and held it until 1911. While its\r\nprincipal object was the Dominion or National franchise for all women\r\nit was for years at the head of the effort for the Provincial suffrage\r\nin Ontario. In 1905, in connection with the Woman's Christian\r\nTemperance Union, it organized a very representative deputation to\r\nwait upon the Premier to ask that the Municipal vote possessed by\r\nwidows and spinsters be extended to married women. He said that\r\n'neither he nor any other statesman had placed woman where she was;\r\nthat the Infinite was at work and woman being a part of the Divine\r\nplan her place was assigned by a greater power.' In 1906 a deputation\r\nfrom the association, headed by Dr. Stowe Gullen, with Dr. Margaret\r\nGordon and Mrs. Flora McDonald Denison as speakers, called on the\r\nMayor and Council of Toronto and asked them to pass a resolution for\r\nthe extension of this Municipal franchise. They did so and sent it by\r\nthis deputation to the Legislature. As a result a bill for it was\r\nintroduced and after a day's fun and sarcasm in the House it was\r\ndefeated by 69 to 2.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 the Dominion Association at its annual meeting changed its\r\nname to the Canadian Suffrage Association. In 1908 it decided not to\r\nmemorialize the Government but to make greater efforts to organize and\r\nfor this purpose Mrs. Denison, vice-president and official organizer,\r\nvisited Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. On March 24, 1909, the\r\nassociation sent a deputation of 1,000 of its members to the House of\r\nParliament to ask for full suffrage for the women of Ontario. Dr.\r\nStowe Gullen presented with a strong argument a petition which\r\nrepresented 100,000 names and many important organizations, among them\r\nthe Women's University Clubs, Women Teachers' Association, Medical\r\nAlumnae of the University of Toronto, Progressive Club, Trades and\r\nLabor Council, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers,\r\nWoman's Christian Temperance Union and Dominion Temperance\r\nAssociation. There were prominent men and women speakers. Sir James\r\nWhitney, the Premier, answered adversely. The crowds were so great\r\nthat Cabinet ministers could not gain admittance but all this\r\ndemonstration resulted in no action. Allan Studholme, Labor member\r\nfrom East Hamilton, introduced a bill for woman suffrage, which was\r\ndefeated.\r\n\r\nIn 1910 all the members throughout the Province were written to or\r\ninterviewed by suffragists, but the woman suffrage bill of the labor\r\nmembers was defeated. Through the efforts of Mrs. Denison, Mrs.\r\nEmmeline Pankhurst and Mrs. Philip Snowden of England came to Toronto\r\nand lectured in Massey Hall to immense audiences. Dr. Gordon attended\r\nthe annual meeting of the National Council of Women in Halifax and\r\npresented a motion that \"the Council place itself on record in favor\r\nof the enfranchisement of women.\" This was seconded by Dr. Rachel Todd\r\nin behalf of the Medical Alumnae, University of Toronto. After much\r\ndiscussion it was carried and this large and influential organization\r\nwas brought into the movement. The Local Council of Toronto adopted a\r\nresolution to the same effect.\r\n\r\nIn 1911 the association organized another deputation to wait upon the\r\nPremier March 4, who were introduced by William Munns, the secretary.\r\nThe bill introduced by Mr. Studholme, seconded by W. Proudfoot,\r\nLiberal from Center Huron after three days' discussion was lost.\r\nBefore the Provincial elections the association sent a letter to all\r\ncandidates and twenty-five answered that they would vote for woman\r\nsuffrage if elected. In June Dr. Stowe Gullen resigned the presidency\r\nand Mrs. Denison was chosen in her place and Mrs. William Munns was\r\nelected secretary. Mrs. Denison, who was an ardent suffragist, an\r\nindefatigable worker and a fine organizer, edited a page in the\r\nToronto _Sunday World_ each week devoted to woman suffrage, which was\r\nof immeasurable value. She represented the association at the meetings\r\nof the International Woman Suffrage Alliance in Copenhagen in 1906 and\r\nin Budapest in 1913. This last year she organized a delegation and\r\nwent with them to take part in the suffrage parade in Washington, D.\r\nC., March 3.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 three suffrage bills were introduced. A resolution was moved\r\nby Mr. Marshall, Liberal, from Lincoln, seconded by Mr. Bowman,\r\nLiberal whip, but no bill was passed. Bills were presented every year\r\nonly to be voted down by the Conservative Government. N. W. Rowell,\r\nthe Liberal leader, pledged the support of his party in a non-partisan\r\nmeasure but in vain.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 Mrs. Denison secured for a deputation an interview with Sir\r\nRobert L. Borden, Prime Minister of Canada, to ask that the Dominion\r\nParliament should grant a national franchise to women. He stated the\r\ndifficulties in the way, as the Election Act provided that the\r\nProvincial lists of voters were in force for the election of the\r\nmembers of the Dominion Parliament and if the Provinces did not first\r\ngrant the suffrage to women the cost and work would be required of\r\npreparing new lists of the women voters. He said that each Province\r\nmust enfranchise its women before the Federal Government could act and\r\nno Province had done so at this time.\r\n\r\nIn 1914 Dr. Gordon, president of the Toronto Suffrage Society,\r\norganized an influential deputation from its members which asked the\r\ncity council to submit to the voters at the approaching local election\r\nthe question of extending to married women the Municipal franchise now\r\npossessed by widows and spinsters simply to ascertain their opinion.\r\nThis was done and the measure was carried by a majority of 13,713.\r\nDuring 1914, 1915 and 1916 Dr. Gordon sent a letter to the councils of\r\nthe other cities, towns, villages and rural communities asking them to\r\nhold a referendum or to pass a resolution in favor of this extension\r\nand send it to the Government. The letters were followed by a\r\nsuccessful campaign in the municipalities by the society. As a result\r\n33 referenda were held, all giving favorable majorities, and about 160\r\nother municipal governments memorialized the Ontario Legislature in\r\nfavor. Dr. Gullen published an open letter describing these efforts.\r\nThey had no effect on the Legislature nor did it make any concessions\r\nto the women even in the way of much needed better laws, for which\r\nthey petitioned.\r\n\r\nAt the annual meeting of the Canadian Suffrage Association, October 30\r\nMrs. Denison resigned the presidency and Dr. Gordon was elected. On\r\nthe 31st the members put on record the work of its beloved founder and\r\none of the originators of the National Council of Women by presenting\r\na bronze bust of Dr. Emily Howard Stowe to the city of Toronto. It was\r\nofficially received by the Mayor and placed in the main corridor of\r\nMunicipal Hall, the first memorial of this kind to any woman in\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nThis year the National Council of Women took a firm stand and urged\r\nthat each Province fully enfranchise its women and asked the Dominion\r\nParliament to grant the Federal vote to women. In 1915 the Ontario\r\nsociety sent another deputation to the Legislature to ask for the\r\nMunicipal franchise and reminded the Premier, Sir William Hearst, of\r\nthe favorable verdict that had been given by the voters. He answered\r\nthat \"it had not been proved that the influence of women for good\r\nwould be increased by the possession of the franchise.\" When asked if\r\nhe would submit the question of their full suffrage to the voters of\r\nthe Province he replied that this would mean only a vote by the men\r\nand he was most desirous to ascertain the wishes of the women! No\r\nattention was paid to either request. In 1916 the association again\r\nwent to the Legislature with a petition but Mr. Studholme's bill was\r\ndefeated. This year came the complete enfranchisement of women in all\r\nthe Provinces between Ontario and the Pacific Ocean. The women of\r\nCanada had given their full share of the work and sacrifices demanded\r\nby the war for two years but in the Province of Ontario not the\r\nslightest recognition had been shown of their right to a voice in the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe franchise societies and the W. C. T. U. canvassed the whole\r\nProvince, circulating a monster petition for the full Provincial\r\nfranchise. A group of women in Toronto organized an Anti-Suffrage\r\nAssociation and called a public meeting at which the suffragists were\r\ndenounced for \"pressing their claims when all the thought and effort\r\nof the Government should be given to the demands of the war.\" Up to\r\n1917 neither the Liberal nor Conservative party had shown the least\r\nfavor to woman suffrage but now the former, which was out of power,\r\nmade it a plank of its platform and its leader, N. W. Rowell, on\r\nFebruary 20 at the opening of Parliament moved an amendment to the\r\nspeech from the throne providing for the full enfranchisement of women\r\nin Ontario. It was declared out of order by Premier Hearst. A few days\r\nlater J. W. Johnson of Belleville, a private member, introduced a bill\r\nfor woman suffrage. On February 27 this bill was indorsed for the\r\nConservative Government by Premier Hearst, who said: \"Having taken our\r\nwomen into partnership with us in our tremendous task I ask, 'Can we\r\njustly deny them a share in the government of the country, the right\r\nto have a say about the making of the laws they have been so\r\nheroically trying to defend?' My answer is, 'I think not.'\"\r\n\r\nThus without discussion this act of justice for which women had\r\npetitioned since 1903 was granted by a single word. Mr. Rowell and the\r\nLiberals united with the Conservatives and the bill was passed Feb.\r\n27, 1917. Although passed by a Union Government it was largely due to\r\nthe incessant efforts of the Liberal members in the past.\r\n\r\nWhile in Quebec and a few of the small Provinces the suffrage was\r\nstill withheld from women it now so largely prevailed that their\r\nnational enfranchisement by the Dominion Parliament seemed the next\r\ninevitable step. During 1917 Sir Robert Borden made a visit to England\r\nand the war front. Although it was estimated that in some of the\r\nProvinces one man in every fourteen had enlisted, he returned fully\r\nconvinced that \"conscription\" would be necessary and this would\r\nrequire a referendum to the voters. Quebec would vote solidly against\r\nit, as would certain elements in the other Provinces. A Fusion party\r\nwas formed in the Parliament and under tremendous pressure a War Time\r\nElection Act was passed in September. It disfranchised during the war\r\nDoukhobors and Mennonites, conscientious objectors, those born in\r\nenemy countries not naturalized before 1902 and some others. It\r\nenfranchised certain women in all the Provinces and Yukon and the\r\nNorthwest Territories, which send a member to the Parliament, in the\r\nfollowing words: \"Every female who, being a British subject and\r\nqualified as to age, race and residence as required of a male, is the\r\nwife, widow, mother, sister or daughter of any person, male or female,\r\nliving or dead, who is serving or has served without Canada in any of\r\nthe military forces, or within or without in any of the naval forces\r\nof Canada or Great Britain in the present war....\"\r\n\r\nIt was estimated that this Act would enable about 600,000 women to\r\nvote when the question of \"conscription\" was submitted and leave about\r\n1,000,000 unable to do so although having the Provincial franchise. It\r\nraised a storm of protest from those who were not included and who\r\ndoubted that this arbitrary action would result in securing\r\nconscription. Sir Robert Borden had no doubts but based his faith on\r\nthe belief that those women having relatives in the war would vote to\r\ncompel other men to go and he said at the time: \"We are now verging on\r\nthe point at which women must be entitled to the same voice in\r\ndirecting the affairs of this country as men, and as far as I am\r\nconcerned I commit myself absolutely to that proposition, but in\r\nworking it out it is necessary to take into account certain\r\nconsiderations.\" With this concession the women had to be satisfied.\r\nThe general campaign came on in November 1917, with \"conscription\" the\r\nissue on which the Government appealed for return to power. The\r\nelection took place in December and the Union Government carried the\r\nfour Western Provinces, Ontario and New Brunswick, receiving almost\r\nthe full vote of the women. The Opposition carried Quebec, Nova Scotia\r\nand Prince Edward Island.\r\n\r\nDuring the campaign the Premier several times pledged himself and his\r\nGovernment to equal suffrage for women and it was generally recognized\r\nthat if they were re-elected this pledge would be redeemed at an early\r\ndate. This action was urged by the Labor members. On Feb. 15, 1918,\r\nthe Government announced the extension of the full suffrage to the\r\nwomen of Canada as a part of its policy and its consideration of the\r\nmeasure at the approaching session of Parliament. Later the War\r\nCabinet invited all of the large organizations of women in the\r\nDominion to send representatives to a conference with the Government\r\nin Ottawa on March 1. There was a very large response and the\r\ndelegates were welcomed by the Governor General, the Duke of\r\nDevonshire, with a tribute to the conduct of women during the war. The\r\nPresident of the Privy Council, N. W. Rowell, outlined the work of the\r\nConference and the confidence felt by the Government in the continued\r\nassistance of women. They were assured by various members of the\r\nGovernment of the desire for their suggestions on all matters\r\nconnected with the carrying on of the war. The conference lasted for a\r\nweek and the women submitted their recommendations, the first of which\r\nwas that women should be permitted to take a fuller share in the\r\nresponsibilities of government. All of these were respectfully and\r\ncordially received by the members of the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament opened on March 18. The Duke of Devonshire read the\r\nspeech from the throne to galleries crowded with women and said in the\r\ncourse of it: \"A bill for extending the franchise to women, with\r\nsuitable provisions respecting naturalization, will be submitted and\r\ncommended to your consideration.\"\r\n\r\nSir Robert Borden introduced the bill March 21 and an extended\r\ndiscussion took place in the House on the 23rd. There was no real\r\nopposition, although the members from Quebec were not friendly, saying\r\nthat it was not wanted there by men or women. Sir Wilfred Laurier\r\nfavored woman suffrage but thought it should be conferred only by the\r\nProvinces. The Premier spoke at length in moving the second reading.\r\nIt passed without division and again on the third reading April 12,\r\n1918, when the full Parliamentary or Federal suffrage was conferred on\r\nevery woman who fulfilled the following conditions: (1) Is a British\r\nsubject; (2) is of the full age of 21 years or upwards; (3) possesses\r\nthe qualifications which would entitle a male person to vote at a\r\nDominion election in the Province in which the woman is seeking to\r\nvote, provided that a married woman or a daughter living at home with\r\nher parents shall be deemed to have any necessary property or income\r\nqualifications if her husband or either of her parents is so\r\nqualified. A woman is banned if married to an enemy alien. This Act\r\nsuperseded the War Time Election Act.[218] The following year\r\nthis Parliament passed an Act enabling a wife to retain her\r\nnationality.[219]\r\n\r\nIn New Brunswick in 1908, led by Mrs. Fiske, Mrs. Hathaway and Miss\r\nPeters, the suffragists memorialized the Legislature to extend the\r\nfull suffrage to women but a bill for this purpose was defeated. In\r\n1909 a bill to give it to taxpaying widows and spinsters passed the\r\nUpper House and after much discussion in the Lower House was\r\npostponed. In 1915 married women were included in the Municipal\r\nfranchise possessed by widows and spinsters. These efforts were\r\ncontinued from year to year and finally after the Dominion franchise\r\nhad been conferred, the Elections Act was amended by the Legislative\r\nAssembly on April 17, 1919, to confer complete universal suffrage on\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nOn May 20, 1919, the Council of Yukon Territory amended its Election\r\nLaw to read: \"In this Ordinance, unless the context otherwise\r\nrequires, words importing the masculine gender include females and the\r\nwords 'voter' and 'elector' include both men and women ... and under\r\nit women shall have the same rights and privileges as men.\"\r\n\r\nBills to give the full suffrage to women in Nova Scotia were many\r\ntimes defeated. In 1916, when all the western provinces were\r\nenfranchising their women, the Lower House of the Legislature passed a\r\nbill for it and later rescinded it on the excuse that it was not\r\ndesired by the women. This put them on their mettle and they took\r\naction to convince the lawmakers that they did want it. The suffrage\r\nsociety was re-organized and a resolution was adopted by the executive\r\nboard of the Local Council of Women and sent to every member of the\r\nLegislature. A joint independent committee was created with Mrs.\r\nCharles Archibald chairman and suffrage groups were formed within many\r\norganizations of women. All the members of the Government were\r\ninterviewed and many promised support and the two Government\r\nnewspapers were favorable. Before the committee had time to put in a\r\nbill one was drafted by Supreme Court Justice Russell and introduced\r\nby R. H. Graham. The women filled the galleries at its second reading\r\nand it passed without opposition and was referred to the Law\r\nAmendments Committee, of which the Attorney General was chairman. It\r\ngave a public hearing and the women crowded the Assembly Chamber\r\nupstairs and downstairs and nine short speeches were made by women.\r\nThe Premier and Attorney General said it was the best organized\r\nhearing and best presented case that had come before a House Committee\r\nin twenty-five years. The Bill was left with the committee with the\r\nassurance that it would be well cared for--and then it was postponed\r\nindefinitely! The excuse was that there had been no demand from the\r\ncountry districts! By another year, however, it was too late for such\r\ntactics and when Lieutenant Governor McCallum Grant opened the\r\nLegislature with the speech from the throne on Feb. 21, 1918, he\r\nannounced that the electoral franchise would be given to women. The\r\namended Franchise Act went through the Lower House without opposition;\r\nhad its second reading in the Senate April 29 and the third May 3, and\r\nreceived the royal assent May 23. This added the State suffrage to the\r\nFederal, which had been conferred the preceding month.\r\n\r\nWidows and spinsters in the Province of Quebec had Municipal and\r\nSchool suffrage from 1892. In 1903 in the city council of Montreal an\r\namendment to the charter was moved to take it away. The Woman's\r\nChristian Temperance Union held several large public meetings to\r\noppose such action addressed by prominent men. The press published\r\narticles and letters of protest and it was voted down. In 1910 the\r\nfirst suffrage society was formed in Montreal with Mrs. Bullock\r\npresident. In 1914 a deputation of Montreal women presented a petition\r\nto the Premier, Sir Lorner Guoin, asking that women might sit on\r\nschool boards and that the Municipal franchise be extended to married\r\nwomen. No action was taken. After the Federal Suffrage was granted in\r\n1918 by the Dominion Parliament, which included the women of Quebec, a\r\nbill was introduced in its Legislature to grant them the Provincial\r\nfranchise, which was voted down. Similar bills were defeated in 1918\r\nand 1920 and Quebec remains the only Province in Canada where women\r\ndo not possess the State franchise in addition to the National.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEWFOUNDLAND.\r\n\r\nWhen the Provinces of Canada united in a Confederation Newfoundland\r\nwas the only one that declined to enter it and remained independent.\r\nTherefore, when the Dominion suffrage was conferred by the Parliament\r\nin 1918 it did not include the women of this island. This was keenly\r\nfelt by many of them and they made efforts to have its Legislature\r\ngrant them the Provincial franchise but without success. In 1921 the\r\nWoman Suffrage League determined to make an organized effort and\r\ncollected a petition of 10,000 names, representing every district, and\r\npresented it to the Legislature. From the first the Premier, Sir\r\nRichard Anderson Squires, was hostile and this was the case with most\r\nof the Cabinet, but Minister of Marine Coaker showed a friendly\r\nspirit; Minister of Justice Warren introduced the bill and Mr.\r\nJennings, chairman of the Board of Public Works, agreed to bring it up\r\nfor action. After the sending of many deputations to the Executive\r\nMembers of the Government the women were astonished at being told one\r\nday that these members had held a meeting and it had been arranged\r\nthat the Premier himself should introduce the bill as a Government\r\nmeasure. Seven went with Mr. Jennings by pre-arrangement to the\r\nPremier's office and meeting Mr. Coaker he said: \"Your bill goes\r\nthrough all right, the Premier has his orders.\" Some provisions had\r\nbeen attached to the bill--non-eligibility to office, no voting power\r\nuntil the next general election and an age limit of 30 years. The\r\nPremier promised to have the Government reduce this to 25 and they\r\nwere compelled to agree. Then he impressed upon them that the bill\r\nwould go through as a Government measure, declaring: \"I will pass it\r\nthis session, whether the House closes in one month or three--what I\r\nsay goes!\"\r\n\r\nSome time afterwards the women read in an account of the House\r\nproceedings that the Premier had said in answer to a question that the\r\nbill was not a Government measure. An official letter was at once sent\r\nfrom the Woman Suffrage League, reminding him of his promise, to which\r\nhe made no answer. They obtained an interview with him at which he\r\ntreated them very discourteously and denied all responsibility for the\r\nbill after its second reading. They could get no satisfaction from any\r\nmember of the Government. The bill was not reported from the committee\r\nfor weeks and when at last brought before the House in August it was\r\nturned over to a Select Committee of five, three of them pronounced\r\nanti-suffragists, and was not heard of again.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH AFRICA.\r\n\r\nAt the present time South Africa has the distinction of being the only\r\nEnglish-speaking nation that has not enfranchised its women. There\r\nseems to have been some agitation for a vote by the Boer women in\r\nearly days but a \"movement\" for it was definitely begun in 1895, when\r\nat the annual conference of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union of\r\nCape Colony at Kimberley, woman suffrage was made one of their\r\nofficial departments of work. In 1902 a Woman's Enfranchisement League\r\nwas formed in Durban, Natal, and in a few years one in Cape Town, Cape\r\nColony, followed by others in seven or eight towns. In 1904 M. L.\r\nNeithling moved in the Legislative Council of Cape Colony a resolution\r\nto enfranchise widows and spinsters with the required property and\r\neducational qualifications, which was discussed but not voted on. In\r\n1907 Dr. Viljoen presented one to extend the suffrage to women on the\r\nsame terms as to men. The division showed 24 in favor of it, twelve\r\nfrom each party.\r\n\r\nIn 1909 the Enfranchisement Leagues of Durban, Cape Town, Johannesburg\r\nand Pretoria united in sending four delegates to the International\r\nWoman Suffrage Alliance meeting in London. This year representatives\r\nof Cape Colony, Natal, Transvaal and Orange Free State met in a\r\nnational convention to prepare a constitution for the Union of South\r\nAfrica and the suffrage leagues sent a numerously signed petition\r\nasking that it include the franchise of women. This was rejected and\r\nthey were told to \"await a more convenient season.\" The women were\r\nmuch aroused and early in 1910 the Women's Citizen Club of Cape Town\r\nand the Women's Reform Club of Johannesburg were formed. In the summer\r\nof 1911 Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, president of the International\r\nWoman Suffrage Alliance, accompanied by Dr. Aletta Jacobs, president\r\nof the National Association of The Netherlands, made a tour of 4,000\r\nmiles in South Africa, remaining 76 days. They were present when the\r\ndelegates from eleven suffrage societies met and organized the Women's\r\nEnfranchisement Association of the Union of South Africa and it soon\r\nhad twenty-two branches. The visits of the international president\r\nwith the suffragists of the different localities gave them much\r\ncourage and inspiration and thenceforth she was in close touch with\r\nthem, conferring and advising.\r\n\r\nThe new association presented a monster petition to the Parliament in\r\n1912 and Mr. Andrews of the Transvaal introduced a woman suffrage\r\nbill, which after two days' debate was defeated by 70 to 30 votes. In\r\n1914 Mr. Wyndham's bill did not reach a vote. In 1917 Mr. Rockey's was\r\ndefeated by 63 to 28. In 1918 a woman suffrage clause in the new\r\nElectoral Bill was defeated by 54 to 39. All this time the splendid\r\nservice and sacrifice of the women during the long years of the war\r\nwas being lauded, while St. Paul's definition of their \"sphere\" was\r\nbeing quoted as a reason for not giving them the suffrage.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1919, a conference took place in Cape Town and it was\r\ndecided that the three suffrage associations unite immediately and\r\nform a standing committee of their parliamentary secretaries through\r\nwhich intensive work could be done with the Parliament. On April 1 Mr.\r\nWyndham introduced the following motion: \"In the opinion of this House\r\nthe sex qualification for the exercise of the parliamentary franchise\r\nshould be removed.\" It simply affirmed the principle but was\r\nstrenuously debated without regard to party lines and finally carried\r\nby a vote of 44 to 42. No further action was taken. Mrs. Laura Ruxton,\r\nparliamentary secretary, attended the convention of the Government\r\nParty to present the question, addressed it and the resolution to put\r\na woman suffrage plank in the platform was carried by 72 to 58. The\r\nUnionist, Labor and South African parties accepted it, the Nationalist\r\nParty alone refusing it. At a banquet in Bloemfontaine Premier Botha\r\nappealed to the Parliament, saying that in view of the great services\r\nof women during the war the men would be compelled to give them the\r\nfranchise. He died soon afterwards and petitions from the most\r\nrepresentative citizens then began to pour in upon his successor,\r\nGeneral Smuts.\r\n\r\nIn 1920 Daniel McLaren Brown presented a resolution that in the\r\nopinion of this House the time has arrived when the right of voting\r\nfor members of Parliament and the Provincial Councils should be\r\nextended to women. After a two days' debate it passed on May 3 by 66\r\nayes, 39 noes, a majority of 27 as against two a year before. Mr.\r\nBrown then introduced a bill conferring this right. A deputation of\r\n500 women carried an immense petition for it to the Parliament and it\r\npassed first reading by 66 to 47. Although Premier Smuts had supported\r\nit as \"a great and necessary reform\" and promised it every chance he\r\ndeclined to make it a Government measure or give any facilities for\r\nsecond reading. Mr. Brown and his House Committee and the Hon.\r\nSecretary, Mr. Mullineux, worked valiantly for the bill but it got no\r\nfurther, although eight of the Cabinet ministers were in favor of it\r\nand the Government Party had endorsed it. It is the almost\r\ninsurmountable objection to the colored vote which is the chief factor\r\nin preventing women's enfranchisement.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament of Rhodesia gave full State suffrage to women in April,\r\n1919, and that of the British East African Protectorate in July, 1919.\r\nIn both this carried eligibility to office and a woman was elected to\r\nthe Parliament of Rhodesia in 1920. In several of the States women\r\nhave the Municipal franchise and have been elected to the city\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIA.\r\n\r\nThere has been remarkable progress in the enfranchisement of women in\r\nIndia, although it has been for the most part since 1920, with which\r\nthis volume of the History closes. The Women's Indian Association\r\nranks with other women's organizations in the British Dominions and\r\nhas branches throughout the country. There are many political reform\r\norganizations and almost without exception they are willing to include\r\nwomen in any rights obtained. Increased opportunities for their\r\neducation have been opened and there are hundreds of women university\r\ngraduates. In several cities the limited municipal vote that men have\r\nis shared by women and they are eligible to the council. In 1917\r\nGreat Britain announced that self-government would be given to the\r\npeople of India and the Women's Indian Association and other agencies\r\nbegan a strenuous campaign to have women included. In 1918 the Women's\r\nIndian Association had suffrage resolutions introduced in many\r\nprovincial conferences and national congresses of men and they were\r\nusually passed by large majorities. The British Parliament sent a\r\ncommittee to India to collect evidence as to the amount of franchise\r\nthat should be included in the proposed Government Bill and\r\ndistinguished men and women appeared before it in behalf of women,\r\namong them Mrs. Annie Besant, president of the National Home Rule\r\nLeague of India, which was strongly in favor of woman suffrage.\r\nContrary to all the evidence the committee reported against it. Mass\r\nmeetings of women in India were held in protest. In 1919 eminent women\r\nand men were sent to London to present the case to Parliament. They\r\nwere cordially greeted by the British suffragists and given every\r\npossible assistance. A petition was sent to the Government of India\r\nCommittee by the Women Citizen's Union of the British Dominions, where\r\nin all but South Africa women were now fully enfranchised.\r\n\r\nAll were in vain and woman suffrage was not included in the India\r\nReform Bill but the question was left to the decision of the governing\r\nbodies that had been created. The women then had to begin campaigns\r\nthroughout India, mass meetings, petitions, even processions and\r\nlobbying. In May, 1921, the Madras Presidency, one of the largest\r\ndivisions of the country, gave the complete franchise to women and it\r\nwas followed soon afterwards by the great Bombay Presidency, whose\r\nLegislative Council voted for it by 52 to 25, and by that of Burmah.\r\nEach State has its Legislative Council and a number of these have\r\ngiven the vote to women. The movement is active for it throughout\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[217] See History of Woman Suffrage, Vol. III, page 832.\r\n\r\n[218] On Dec. 6, 1921, Miss Agnes McPhail was elected to the House of\r\nCommons for Southeast Grey.\r\n\r\n[219] This Act was heralded far and wide, as it was unprecedented. In\r\n1920, giving as a reason that the Act had been only a war measure, it\r\nwas repealed bodily by the Parliament and the old Act substituted with\r\na few amendments that did not by any means give the privileges\r\nafforded by the new one. It was generally believed that this was done\r\nunder the direct influence of England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nWOMAN SUFFRAGE IN MANY COUNTRIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Volume IV of the History of Woman Suffrage was written in 1900\r\nfour pages contained all the information that could be obtained in\r\nregard to woman suffrage outside of the United States and Great\r\nBritain and her colonies. At the time the first International Council\r\nof Women was held in Washington, in 1888, under the auspices of the\r\nNational Woman Suffrage Association of the United States, Great\r\nBritain was the only other country that had an organization for this\r\npurpose. At the writing of the present volume in 1920 there are\r\ncomparatively few countries in the world having a constitutional form\r\nof government where women are not enfranchised. The only two of\r\ninfluence in Europe are France and Italy; the others are Switzerland,\r\nSpain, Portugal, Greece and Turkey. Women do not vote in Oriental\r\ncountries. This is also true of Mexico, Central and South America.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINLAND.[220]\r\n\r\nThe first country in Europe to give equal suffrage to women was\r\nFinland in 1906, when it was a Grand Duchy of Russia with its own Diet\r\nor Parliament, whose bills required the sanction of the Czar to become\r\nlaws. Girls were admitted to the full privileges of the university in\r\n1878 and in the student organization they were on a footing of perfect\r\nequality. Important positions and even places in the civic\r\nadministration were open to women. As early as 1863 the Diet gave the\r\nlocal or Municipal vote to taxpaying women in the country and in 1872\r\nto those in the towns, but not eligibility to office. In 1897 the\r\nFinnish Women's Association presented a petition to the Diet for full\r\nsuffrage, which did not reach second reading. Its president, Baroness\r\nAlexandra Gripenberg, had attended the World's Congress of Women\r\nduring the Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893 and become\r\nintimately acquainted with Miss Susan B. Anthony, Mrs. May Wright\r\nSewall and other noted suffragists in the United States. In 1899 the\r\nsword of Russia descended, the constitution of Finland was wrecked and\r\nher autonomy, religion, customs, language, everything sacred was\r\nthreatened.\r\n\r\nThe real movement for the full enfranchisement of women began in 1904,\r\nwhen bills were introduced in the Diet. In the autumn the president of\r\nthe Woman's Alliance Union, Miss Annie Furuhjelm, returned from the\r\ninspiration of the great International Council of Women in Berlin and\r\nthe forming of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance. With the\r\npolitical oppression now existing the women were feeling a strong\r\ndesire to share in the responsibility for the fate of the country.\r\nUnder the auspices of the Union the first public meeting for woman\r\nsuffrage was held in Helsingfors on November 7, attended by more than\r\na thousand women of all classes and all parties. Resolutions were\r\npassed that the complete suffrage should be extended to every citizen\r\nand a petition demanding it should be sent to the Diet. For the first\r\ntime the Union included eligibility to office in its demands.\r\nForty-seven addresses of sympathy signed by hundreds of women were\r\nreceived from different parts of the country. From this time the Union\r\ndevoted all its energies to the movement for the franchise.\r\n\r\nIn another year the Russo-Japanese War was over and Russia was in the\r\nmidst of a revolution. In October, 1905, the long pent-up forces of\r\nFinland broke the barriers and a \"national strike\" was inaugurated.\r\nWomen were members of the central committee elected at a mass meeting\r\nto manage it. Those in the highest ranks of society had for the past\r\nyear been members of a secret organization extending over the country\r\nraising funds, smuggling literature and daily risking their lives. For\r\nfive days not a wheel turned and no work was done except under the\r\nmost urgent necessity. There was perfect order and at intervals\r\ndeputations of men and women went to the Russian Governor General in\r\nHelsingfors asking for the restoration of Finnish autonomy. At last\r\nthe Government at St. Petersburg yielded, as all its forces were\r\nrequired in Russia. Meetings of women were then held in all parts of\r\nthe country to elect delegates to another mass meeting in Helsingfors\r\non December 7, where amid great enthusiasm a resolution was carried\r\ndemanding full suffrage and eligibility for every citizen twenty-four\r\nyears old.\r\n\r\nOn May 28, 1906, this reform was passed by the Diet without objection.\r\nIt was taken to the Czar by the eminent Senator Mechelin, who assured\r\nhim that the nation demanded it, and he gave his assent. The Diet\r\nconsisted of four chambers--nobles, clergy, burghers (taxpayers in\r\ntowns and cities) and peasants who were landowners. It was now\r\nreorganized in a single chamber of 200 members. The first election\r\ntook place March 15, 16, 1907, and 19 women were chosen, among them\r\nthe Baroness Gripenberg by the Old Finnish Party. Miss Furuhjelm\r\nbelongs to the comparatively small National Swedish Party, which\r\nelects few candidates. She was elected in 1913 and has been\r\ncontinuously re-elected. Following are the numbers of women members of\r\nParliament: 1907--19; 1908--25; 1909--21; 1910--17; 1911--14;\r\n1913--21; 1916--24; 1917--18; 1919--17. From the beginning the women\r\nmembers have introduced bills for much needed reforms, for the care of\r\nchildren, protection of wives and mothers, benefit of working women\r\nand many for social welfare. While the Czar was in power these were\r\nall vetoed. Since then, with their small number and the great\r\nquestions that have pressed upon the Parliament, they have found it\r\ndifficult to secure domestic legislation but they have united with the\r\nmen in passing many bills of a political nature.\r\n\r\nIn 1917 a law gave to every man and woman 21 years old Municipal\r\nsuffrage, without paying taxes, and eligibility to office and a number\r\nof women have been elected to city and rural councils. The Czar had\r\nhitherto vetoed this bill. In 1919, after a period of the greatest\r\nstrife and sorrow, caused by the World War, Finland severed all\r\nconnection with Russia and became an independent republic. In a new\r\nconstitution adopted at this time the word \"citizen\" was used instead\r\nof \"man\" and all legal disqualifications of women were removed. Both\r\nthe men and women of Finland at last are free.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORWAY.\r\n\r\nThe second country and the first independent Government in Europe to\r\nenfranchise women was Norway. With characteristic caution and\r\nconservatism this was done by degrees, beginning with the Municipal\r\nvote for taxpayers, followed by the complete franchise, and then the\r\nremoval of the taxpaying qualification for the former and at last for\r\nthe full suffrage. The president of the National Association through\r\nall the years has been Mrs. F. M. Qvam of Stenkjaer, county of N.\r\nTrondhjem, to whom the women have given undivided allegiance. The\r\nHistory is indebted to Mrs. Qvam for most of the following\r\ninformation. In sending it she wrote: \"The last twenty years are like\r\nan Adventure of a Thousand Nights for suffragists. What was sown and\r\nseemed lost has sprouted and brought the greatest victories around the\r\nworld. May women now be able to do at least a little of the good that\r\nthe workers for the suffrage have dreamt that it would bring to the\r\nnations.\" Its results in Norway certainly have realized that dream, as\r\nthey have effected many beneficial changes in the laws.\r\n\r\nThe first demand for woman suffrage at a public meeting, so far as\r\nknown, was made in 1869 by Mr. Qvam, a barrister. The pioneer of the\r\norganized movement was Miss Gina Krog, who, after having written and\r\nlectured on the subject for years, founded the Christiania Woman\r\nSuffrage Union in 1885. She was moved to do this by reading the early\r\nvolumes of the History of Woman Suffrage, published about this time\r\nand sent by Miss Susan B. Anthony to the university at Christiania.\r\nMiss Krog edited _Nylande_, a monthly devoted to the interests of\r\nwomen, and continued as president twelve years. She was succeeded by\r\nMiss Rogstad. In 1886 bills were presented to the Parliament in\r\nconnection with an extension of the male suffrage. In 1888 the first\r\nlarge public meeting was held. These were continued, petitions were\r\ncollected, bills were presented at every session, one in 1893\r\nreceiving a majority but not the necessary two-thirds. Women from\r\nother parts of the country became interested and on Feb. 12, 1898, the\r\nNational Woman Suffrage Association was organized; Mrs. Qvam was\r\nelected president. The association is still doing a vast amount of\r\nwork in the interest of women and children. There was never an active\r\nworking membership in the association of more than 2,500 but whenever\r\npetitions were needed for an advanced step the signatures poured in by\r\nthe thousands and the Executive Committee was always assured of a\r\nlarge support. In 1899 the names signed to a petition for equal\r\nsuffrage numbered 12,000.\r\n\r\nAs the grant of universal suffrage to men had been made only the\r\npreceding year it was too much to expect it for women at once but\r\nthrough the assistance of Liberals and Radicals with the help of many\r\nConservative members, and the efforts of women themselves, the\r\nMunicipal suffrage was given by the Parliament in May, 1901, to the\r\nfollowing: All who pay taxes to State or Municipality on an income of\r\n400 kroner in the towns and 300 (about $71) in the country districts,\r\nor have complete or partial joint property with a husband who pays\r\nsuch tax. The amount was so small that a considerable proportion\r\nreceived this vote. It carried eligibility to the municipal councils\r\nand this year 98 women were elected and 160 \"substitutes.\" The\r\nNational Executive Committee conducted an active campaign of\r\nliterature and lectures to rouse the women to exercise their new\r\nprivilege, and it continued to ask for the full suffrage. In 1905 the\r\nmomentous question arose of separation from Sweden. The women made\r\nevery effort to be permitted to vote in the referendum but in vain.\r\nThe National Suffrage Association then undertook the task of obtaining\r\nthe personal signatures of women to a petition in favor of separation\r\nand on August 22 the Executive Committee presented it with an address\r\nto the president of the Storthing with the statement that it was\r\nsigned by 300,000 women, a very large proportion of the adults. All\r\nthe members arose in tribute to the women.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this action by the National Association its petition in\r\n1906 was received with much sympathy. During the summer before the\r\nnext Storthing was to be elected the Executive Committee carried on a\r\nmost strenuous campaign. The president and other members went to the\r\npolitical meetings of all parties to secure endorsement. They called\r\nattention to the granting of universal suffrage to women by the\r\nParliament of Finland in May of that year. The fifty branches\r\nthroughout the country held meetings and sent appeals. In August, when\r\nthe campaign was at its height, the International Woman Suffrage\r\nAlliance held a most successful congress in Copenhagen, which was\r\nenthusiastically commented on by the Danish press and that of Norway\r\nadopted an entirely different attitude from this time. The Lefts and\r\nthe Socialists, who had put the plank in their platforms, elected a\r\nmajority of the Storthing but from January to June the women were in\r\nthe greatest suspense and those in the different constituencies were\r\nworking on their members. Finally on June 14, 1907, after only two\r\nhours' debate, the complete franchise with full eligibility was\r\nconferred on women by 96 to 23 votes, only 82 being needed.\r\n\r\nThis grant was made to the taxpaying women who had the Municipal\r\nfranchise and it was then the work of the National Association to have\r\nit made universal. On June 7, 1910, it succeeded in having the\r\ntaxpaying qualification removed for the Municipal suffrage, and on\r\nJune 11, 1913, a paragraph was added to the constitution which\r\nprovided that \"all men and women 25 years of age, who have been\r\ndomiciled in Norway five years shall be entitled to the complete\r\nfranchise and eligibility.\" Over half the total number of voters are\r\nwomen. Women may be Premier, State officers, Judges, magistrates,\r\nsheriffs, professors in the university, even the theological\r\ndepartment, and are eligible to all public offices with equal pay. The\r\nconstitutional arrangement for electing members of Parliament has been\r\nan obstacle to the election of women but it has now been remedied.\r\nFive had been elected as \"substitutes\" or \"proxies\" to take the place\r\nof absent members. Hundreds have been elected to city councils and to\r\njuries, which are elected for fixed periods. The only positions from\r\nwhich they are excluded are those of a military character, the\r\nCabinet, the diplomatic corps, the clergy and officials of the State\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\n\r\nDENMARK.\r\n\r\nAlthough Danish women had long had the highest educational advantages\r\nand considerable freedom under the laws they had no suffrage up to the\r\ntime the International Woman Suffrage Alliance held its congress in\r\nCopenhagen in 1906. The following women had gone to the meeting in\r\nBerlin in 1904 when this Alliance was organized: Mrs. Johanne Münter,\r\nMrs. Charlotte Norrie, Mrs. Vibetha Salicath, Mrs. Charlotte\r\nEilersgaard, Misses Rasmussen, Eline Hansen and Anna Hude. They\r\nreported its proceedings to the Woman Suffrage Association of Denmark,\r\nformed in 1899, of which Mrs. Louise Norlund was president, and it\r\nthen affiliated with the Alliance and invited it to hold its next\r\ncongress in Copenhagen. At the time it met this association comprised\r\nfourteen societies and they had worked chiefly for the Municipal\r\nfranchise. In 1906 the Kvindesamfund, organized in 1871 to work for\r\nthe general cause of women and advocating the franchise, adopted as\r\npart of its regular program Municipal and full suffrage and joined the\r\nWoman Suffrage Association. As early as 1888 it had presented to the\r\nRigsdag a petition by women all over the country asking the Municipal\r\nfranchise for single women, which the Lower House was willing to grant\r\nbut the Upper House ignored. The interest died out for awhile but in\r\n1904 and 1905 the Lower House again favored this limited grant and in\r\nthe winter of 1906 both Houses received delegates from the society but\r\nno action was taken.\r\n\r\nThe congress of the Alliance in 1906, which lasted over a week, was a\r\nrevelation of the size and strength of the movement for woman suffrage\r\nand the great ability of women. It was cordially recognized by the\r\npress and people and a great impetus was given to the work in Denmark.\r\nThat year a liberal Rigsdag was elected and a suffrage campaign was\r\nmade by the association. In 1907 the Parliament gave a vote to women\r\nfor public boards and the right to be elected to them and the Upper\r\nHouse abandoned its opposition to enfranchising married women. A\r\nstrong movement was developed among women and many new suffrage\r\nsocieties were formed. On April 20, 1908, the Parliament gave to\r\nsingle women who pay taxes and to married women whose husbands are\r\ntaxpayers the Municipal franchise and eligibility. This was a\r\nbeginning and the Suffrage Association distributed 18,000 circulars to\r\nwomen in Copenhagen before the elections the following March urging\r\nthem to go to the polls. Seventy per cent. of those entitled to vote\r\ndid so and seven were elected to the city council. In all districts\r\n127 were elected.\r\n\r\nThere was a growing demand for a revision of the constitution and in\r\nOctober the association sent in a petition that this should include\r\nthe complete enfranchisement of women. There was at this time national\r\nagitation for election reforms, for direct election of the Upper\r\nHouse, for lowering the voting age from 30 to 25, and this went in\r\nwith the other demands. By 1911 the National Association had 144\r\nsections with 12,000 members and maintained a press bureau, supplying\r\n60 papers. Another association, the Landsforbundet, had 100 branches\r\nand 11,000 members, and published a paper, and there were many outside\r\ngroups. Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, president of the International\r\nSuffrage Alliance, stopped in Copenhagen on her way to its congress in\r\nStockholm in June and addressed a mass meeting under the auspices of\r\nthe two large associations.\r\n\r\nWith all parties in favor of giving the full suffrage to women and\r\npublic sentiment favoring it the bill was caught in the maelstrom of\r\nagitation for a revised or new constitution and the Rigsdag refused to\r\nconsider it separately. Finally the bill for a new constitution\r\nincluding woman suffrage passed the Lower House by a vote of 95 to 12.\r\nIt was sent to the Upper House, referred to a committee and there it\r\nremained while the controversy raged over the constitution. This was\r\nstill the situation when the World War broke out in 1914 and it was\r\nApril, 1915, before an entire new constitution passed both Houses by\r\nan enormous majority. It provided for universal suffrage with\r\neligibility for men and women, no taxpaying qualifications, the age to\r\nbe 29 with gradual reduction to 25. A general election at once took\r\nplace on this issue, the new Rigsdag immediately adopted the\r\nconstitution the required second time and on June 5 it was signed by\r\nthe King. The women voted for the first time at a general election in\r\n1918 and nine, representing all parties, were elected to the Rigsdag,\r\nfive to the Upper and four to the Lower House. They voted a second\r\ntime in 1920 and eleven were elected. They have obtained laws for\r\nequal pay, the opening of all positions to women and equal status in\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\n\r\nICELAND.\r\n\r\nIceland was a dependency of Denmark with its own Parliament, the\r\nAlthing. In 1881 a bill was passed, presented by Skuli Thorvoddsen, a\r\nmember and an editor, giving to widows and spinsters who were\r\nhouseholders or maintained a family or were self-supporting, a vote\r\nfor parish and town councils, district boards and vestries, at the age\r\nof 25, which became law in 1882. In 1895 the Woman's Alliance was\r\nformed and a petition of 3,000 women was collected and sent to the\r\nAlthing asking it to consider suffrage for married women and increased\r\nproperty rights, which it ignored. In 1906 Mrs. Briet Asmundsson, the\r\nleader of the woman's movement, attended the congress of the\r\nInternational Woman Suffrage Alliance in Copenhagen, and, returning to\r\nReykjavik, the capital, organized in January, 1907, the Association\r\nfor Women's Rights. In four months 12,000 signatures had been obtained\r\nto a petition for full suffrage for women and eligibility to all\r\noffices. Mr. Thorvoddsen introduced the bill, which was not\r\nconsidered, but one was passed giving the Municipal franchise and\r\neligibility to all women in the Reykjavik and one other district,\r\nwhich became law Jan. 1, 1908. The association carried on a vigorous\r\ncampaign and four women were elected to the council of Reykjavik. Its\r\npresident then made a two months' tour of the country and organized\r\nfive branches. At all political meetings the women had resolutions\r\npresented for equal suffrage and eligibility, which were usually\r\ncarried unanimously. On April 15 a law was passed extending Municipal\r\nsuffrage and eligibility to all women.\r\n\r\nIn 1911 women were made eligible to all State offices, including those\r\nof the church, and a constitutional amendment was passed granting the\r\ncomplete franchise. It had to pass a second Althing and political\r\nquestions arose which were all absorbing until 1914. Then the\r\namendment passed but a compromise had to be made fixing the age for\r\nwomen at 40, to be lowered annually, under much protest, but Premier\r\nEggers refused to submit it to the King of Denmark for his sanction.\r\nIt had to wait until another took the office and finally was signed\r\nJune 19, 1915, two weeks after the women of Denmark were fully\r\nenfranchised. In 1918 a referendum was taken, in which women voted,\r\non making Iceland an independent State having a personal union with\r\nDenmark and the same King, which resulted favorably. A new Althing was\r\nelected Nov. 15, 1919, and a new constitution adopted which gave to\r\nwomen full suffrage at 25, the same age as to men.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEDEN.\r\n\r\nThe story of Sweden is especially interesting as the women were the\r\nfirst in Europe to have the Municipal vote and among the last to have\r\nthe Parliamentary. In 1862 widows and spinsters who had paid taxes had\r\na vote for all officers except members of the Parliament. In 1909 they\r\nwere made eligible for the offices. Later this franchise was enlarged\r\nto admit married women, and in 1918 it was made universal for men and\r\nwomen of 23 without taxpaying requirements. This chapter is indebted\r\nfor much of the information in it to Mrs. Anna B. Wicksell, who was a\r\ndelegate from Sweden to Berlin in 1904, when the International Woman\r\nSuffrage Alliance was formed and is now a vice-president. Mrs.\r\nWicksell gained international fame when her Government appointed her a\r\ndelegate to the League of Nations meeting at Geneva in 1920-21 and she\r\nwas placed on the Mandates Commission.\r\n\r\nThe first bill to give women full suffrage and eligibility was\r\npresented in the Second Chamber by F. D. Borg, an enlightened member,\r\nin 1884 and ridiculed by Parliament and press. In 1902 Carl Lindhagen\r\noffered a bill calling on the Government to investigate the subject.\r\nThe first organized movement among the women was the forming of a\r\nsociety in Stockholm this year and an address to Parliament with 5,641\r\nsignatures urging this bill. It was rejected by 111 to 64 in the\r\nSecond Chamber (Lower House) and without a division in the First. In\r\n1904 his bill, endorsed by 30 members, received 115 noes, 93 ayes and\r\nno vote in the First Chamber. In 1905, endorsed by 57, it had 89 noes,\r\n30 ayes in the First Chamber and the Second rejected it by 109 to 88.\r\nThe suffrage societies had multiplied and now there were 63.\r\n\r\nA National Suffrage Association was formed in 1904, which still\r\nexists. It carried on the work for seventeen years, under the\r\npresidency of Miss Anna Whitlock, Dr. Lydia Wahlstrom, Miss Signe\r\nBergman and Dr. Karolina Widerström. When success finally crowned its\r\nefforts it had 240 branches and 15,000 members. With the great\r\ndifficulties of securing names in this country of widely scattered\r\npeople the petitions collected and sent to Parliament were remarkable,\r\nthe last one in 1914 having 350,000 signatures. Among the women who\r\nwere conspicuous in long and arduous service besides the presidents\r\nwere Mrs. Ann M. Holmgren, Dr. Gulli Petrini, Mrs. Frigga Carlberg and\r\nMrs. Gloria Hallberg. Miss Selma Lagerlöf assisted on great occasions.\r\nMen who for years were most valuable workers were Stockholm's\r\nburgomaster, Carl Lindhagen, and the three Prime Ministers, Karl\r\nStaaf, Nils Edén and Hjalmer Brantung. Two of the most conspicuous\r\nopponents were Mr. Lindeau and Mr. Trygger, through fear that the\r\nSocial Democratic Party would gain.\r\n\r\nThe years 1905-1906 saw much advance, as the separation from Norway\r\ntook place and the question of the enlargement of male suffrage was to\r\nthe fore. The women made strenuous but unsuccessful efforts to have\r\nthe Parliament include women but the bill for men was rejected. It\r\ndid, however, by a majority even in the Upper House, order an\r\ninvestigation of woman suffrage where it existed. Societies were\r\norganized from the Sound to Lapland. King Oscar received a deputation\r\nand in answer to the address of Miss Gertrud Adelborg expressed his\r\nsympathy but said the Government could not endanger the desired\r\nsuffrage for men. In 1907 a petition from 142,128 women was presented\r\nto the Parliament. The Labor Party made woman suffrage a part of their\r\nprogram, the Lindhagen group supported it, a number of bills were\r\nbrought in but all was in vain. At a woman suffrage mass meeting in\r\n1908 in Stockholm thousands were turned away. Meetings were held\r\nthroughout the country. The Liberals and Social Democrats put woman\r\nsuffrage in their programs. At the opening of Parliament the King's\r\nspeech contained a few favorable words. Leading members conferred with\r\nthe Executive Committee of the National Suffrage Association, with the\r\nresult that it arranged a meeting at the Grand Hotel with many members\r\nof Parliament present, who were addressed by prominent women and\r\nseemed much impressed, but all suffrage bills were lost.\r\n\r\nThe well-organized suffragists then went actively into the campaign\r\nand worked to defeat their opponents. As a result a majority was\r\nelected to the Second Chamber in favor of giving the suffrage to\r\nwomen. A deputation of 35 was granted an audience by the new King,\r\nGustav V, and he expressed the hope that the time was near when their\r\nclaims could be regarded. In February, 1909, the Government's bill\r\nembodying universal suffrage for men finally passed both Chambers and\r\nit included eligibility to the municipal offices for the women who\r\ncould vote for them, which the suffrage association had worked for.\r\nThe next April the first woman suffrage bill was passed by the Second\r\nChamber. In 1910 37 women were chosen for the councils in 34 towns,\r\nwhich partly elect the First Chamber.\r\n\r\nThe situation looked so favorable that the National Association\r\ninvited the International Woman Suffrage Alliance to hold its congress\r\nin Stockholm in 1911 for the effect which this large and important\r\nbody would have on public sentiment. After this had been arranged, the\r\nSwedish women learned to their disappointment and indignation that the\r\nGovernment did not propose to introduce a woman suffrage bill this\r\nyear, as they wished first to see the effect of the new universal\r\nfranchise law for men. Besides, the investigation of woman suffrage\r\nwas not completed! A representative Men's League for Woman Suffrage\r\nwas formed. A new Second Chamber was to be elected and as the suffrage\r\nbill would have to be acted upon by two Parliaments there would have\r\nto be a wait of several years. A bill was presented and passed the\r\nLower House but all progressive legislation was blocked by the First\r\nChamber. During the campaign the women worked vigorously for the\r\nelection of Liberal and Social Democratic candidates, who had woman\r\nsuffrage on their program, 29 women speaking on their party platforms\r\nat 217 meetings. They formed a large majority of the new Government\r\nand a Liberal Cabinet was formed. The First Chamber was dissolved and\r\nin the new one, instead of a negligible few, there were 64 Liberals\r\nand Social Democrats to 86 Conservatives. In his speech on opening the\r\nnew Parliament in 1912 the King announced that he would present a bill\r\ngiving to women suffrage and eligibility on the same conditions as\r\npossessed by men. On April 2 the Government brought in this bill\r\nwhich was carried in the Lower House by 140 to 66; defeated in the\r\nUpper by 86 to 58. This year 64 women councillors were elected. The\r\nwomen strengthened their organization, added to their monster\r\npetitions, held their mass meetings and then in 1914 came the War!\r\n\r\nIn the flood-tide of democracy which resulted the existence of the\r\nkingdom itself was threatened. The First Chamber of nobles and landed\r\nproprietors was forced to abandon its conservatism. The Reform Bill\r\nproposed in December, 1918, at an extra session, abolished plural\r\nvoting, gave universal Municipal suffrage, made women eligible to\r\nCounty Councils and provided for the Parliamentary franchise for them.\r\nAt the session of 1919 the bill was laid before the Parliament and on\r\nMay 24 it was passed by both Chambers without opposition. On the 29th\r\ngreat celebrations were held in Stockholm and other cities and at the\r\nold university town of Upsala the speakers were the Archbishop, Dr.\r\nSelma Lagerlöf and Prime Minister Brantung.\r\n\r\nIt was not all ended, however, for the measure had to pass a second\r\nParliament, although this was a mere matter of form. The elections\r\ntook place in the autumn of 1920. On Jan. 26, 1921, without debate,\r\nthe law was sanctioned by the new Parliament and two days later it was\r\npromulgated by the King. It gives complete, universal suffrage to\r\nwomen. In September the election occurred in which women took part and\r\nfive were elected to the Parliament, one of them to the First Chamber,\r\nwhich so many years stood between women and their political rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NETHERLANDS.\r\n\r\nThe story of woman suffrage in the Netherlands is one of intense,\r\nunceasing work for a quarter of a century. The old constitution did\r\nnot specifically exclude women and in 1882 Dr. Aletta Jacobs, the\r\nfirst woman physician, who had been studying in England and met the\r\nsuffrage leaders, applied to be registered for an election. This was\r\nrefused and she carried the case through the highest court with a\r\ndecision against her. It was in effect that by the letter of the law\r\nshe was eligible but the spirit of the law intended to exclude women.\r\nIn 1885 a new constitution was made which definitely excluded women\r\nbut made a further extension of the suffrage to men, who had not\r\nasked for it. It required a long, hard effort to organize for woman\r\nsuffrage, as there was almost no sentiment for it, but on Feb. 5,\r\n1894, the Vereeniging voor Vrouwenkiesrecht was formed of women in\r\ndifferent places with Mrs. Versluys-Poelman, president. She held the\r\noffice eight years and then Dr. Jacobs, who had been president of the\r\nAmsterdam branch during this time, was elected and served till the\r\ncontest was finished in 1918. It is to Dr. Jacobs this chapter is\r\nindebted for the information it contains. This was the only\r\nassociation of a national character until 1908, when the Bond voor\r\nVrouwenkiesrecht came into existence. When the work ended it had 80\r\nbranches and about 10,000 members. The former had 160 branches and\r\nover 25,000 members and reorganized in the Netherlands Society of\r\nWomen Citizens to work for the legal and economic equality of women.\r\n\r\nAt first the press was hostile, all political parties were opposed\r\nexcept a small group of Constitutional Democrats and no member of\r\nParliament would introduce the question. The work had to begin from\r\nthe bottom with personal interviews with the members, watching the\r\nbills relating to women and children, showing the need of women's\r\ninfluence, etc. In 1904 Dr. Jacobs, Misses Johanna W. A. Naber and E.\r\nL. van Dorp, Mrs. von Loenen de Bordes, Mrs. Rutgers Hoitsema and Mrs.\r\nHengeveld Garritson were present at the organization of the\r\nInternational Woman Suffrage Alliance in Berlin, as was Miss Martina\r\nKramers, who was elected Secretary, and the Dutch national association\r\nbecame auxiliary. From that time it went into direct political work,\r\nin 1905 presenting to the Queen and the Prime Minister its request\r\nthat in a proposed revision of the constitution the words men and\r\nwomen be used after citizens. The Commission that drafted it in 1907\r\nrecommended suffrage and eligibility for women. The association,\r\nexpecting a campaign, had invited the International Alliance to hold\r\nits congress in Amsterdam in June, 1908. It proved to be one of the\r\nmost brilliant and successful ever held and was enthusiastically\r\nreceived by the press and the public. An active Men's League for Woman\r\nSuffrage was formed.\r\n\r\nFrom that time the question of woman suffrage was on a constantly\r\nrising tide. A liberal Parliament had been elected and it was to\r\nconsider giving the vote to women. Appeals were made through the\r\nmembers from the fifty branches of the association and through public\r\nmeetings and much outdoor propaganda was carried on in little boats.\r\nThere was no cessation of the work and as a result leaders of the four\r\npolitical parties declared themselves in the Parliament in favor of\r\nthe enfranchisement of women, but in 1909 a Conservative Government\r\nwas elected and the revision was withdrawn. This year the Lutheran and\r\nMennonite churches gave women a vote on all matters. In 1913 the\r\nCabinet announced its own revision of the constitution. Early in 1914\r\nthe association memorialized the Premier and the Queen, sent letters\r\nto all the electors and carried on the most strenuous work. Its\r\nmeetings in every town and city were crowded and in a short time a\r\npetition signed by 165,000 women was presented to the Parliament. Then\r\nthe War broke forth and everything was at a standstill.\r\n\r\nIn 1915 the suffragists were roused by the announcement that the\r\nconstitution would positively be revised. In June they held a big\r\ndemonstration in Amsterdam, in which trade unions and political\r\nparties participated. It was evident that the country was back of the\r\ndemand for woman suffrage. Although street processions were forbidden,\r\nthe burgomaster, a suffragist, allowed it. In The Hague a large one\r\ntook place in September, when the Parliament opened, the burgomaster\r\nyielding to the entreaties of the women that if the Government was\r\ngoing to bring in a new constitution in the midst of the War, which so\r\nmuch concerned women, they should be allowed to express themselves. It\r\nwas preceded by an immense meeting and a resolution calling for woman\r\nsuffrage was passed; thousands of women massed in front of the\r\nParliament House and Dr. Jacobs and a deputation carried it in to the\r\nSpeaker, who promised to do all in his power for them. During all the\r\nweeks while the discussion raged the members had to pass through two\r\nrows of silent women wearing broad sashes with the name of the\r\nassociation on them. Women filled the seats inside and the Speaker\r\noffered his private box to Dr. Jacobs and her friends. Prime Minister\r\nCort van Linden threatened that if a vote were permitted on woman\r\nsuffrage he would withdraw the whole constitution. The members of\r\nParliament were so afraid they would lose universal male suffrage\r\nthat they gave up this amendment and the constitution was adopted\r\nwithout it. It did, however, make the valuable concession that it\r\nshould be possible for the Parliament to grant the suffrage to women\r\nat any time without submitting it to the voters as part of the\r\nconstitution. It also contained the remarkable provision that women\r\nshould be eligible to election to the Parliament and all\r\nrepresentative bodies, although they had not a scrap of suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe exclusion of women was received with the disapproval of the\r\ncountry and in the election campaign of 1918 the demand of all the\r\nnon-clerical parties was for woman suffrage. At the opening of\r\nParliament H. P. Marchant, leader of the Constitutional Democrats,\r\nintroduced a bill for the complete enfranchisement of women. Early in\r\nNovember, 1918, all Europe was alarmed by the revolution in Russia and\r\nThe Netherlands was threatened. There was a demand for woman suffrage\r\nat once as a deterrent. The Government agreed and took up Mr.\r\nMarchant's bill but the danger passed and nothing was done. By\r\nFebruary, 1919, the suffragists were obliged to hold another mass\r\nmeeting and demonstration at The Hague and assure the Government that\r\nthey would rouse the country. The Speaker then brought in the bill,\r\nwhich was discussed in April, and on May 9 universal suffrage for\r\nwomen on the same terms as possessed by men was accepted by a vote of\r\n64 to 10 by the Second Chamber. The following July it passed the First\r\nChamber with five dissenting votes and was signed by the Queen on\r\nSeptember 8.\r\n\r\nIn 1918 a woman had been elected to the Second Chamber and in 1920 one\r\nwas elected to the First Chamber, and there were 36 on County Councils\r\nand 88 on Municipal councils, chosen by men before women had yet\r\nvoted.\r\n\r\n\r\nBELGIUM.\r\n\r\nOn November 23, 1918, five days after the armistice which ended the\r\nWorld War the National Federation for Woman Suffrage in Belgium\r\nresumed its activities with an open letter to the Labor Party,\r\nreferring to their manifesto for universal suffrage and reminding them\r\nthat this included women. A little later it addressed an appeal to the\r\nnewly established Government and started a petition. In the midst of\r\nthe war King Albert and Queen Elizabeth had expressed themselves in\r\nfavor of the enfranchisement of women but when he opened the first\r\nParliament after it was over he recommended only equal, universal\r\nsuffrage for men. Notwithstanding the unfavorable conditions the\r\npetition soon had 35,000 signatures and was sent to the Parliament. By\r\nmidwinter of 1919 the question was one of heated controversy among the\r\nparties, which continued. By April the petition had reached 175,000.\r\nThe Catholics favored woman suffrage, the Liberals and Socialists\r\nopposed it, fearing the influence of the church. To avoid a\r\ndissolution of the Parliament a compromise was finally effected by\r\nwhich the parliamentary vote was given to \"all widows of soldiers and\r\ncivilians killed by the enemy, or, where there is no widow, to the\r\nmother\"; and to \"all women condemned or imprisoned for patriotic acts\r\nduring the enemy occupation.\" This enfranchised about 30,000 women and\r\nwas only to be in effect until a Constituent Assembly should be\r\nelected which would revise the electoral law.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a bill for the Municipal or Communal franchise for women was\r\nintroduced. Plural voting for men was abolished; a general election\r\ntook place November 16 and the new Parliament met in December. The\r\nnecessary two-thirds vote for the Parliamentary suffrage for women\r\nseemed impossible but the three parties were virtually pledged to give\r\nthe Municipal. After three months of controversy and suspense this\r\nCommunal franchise was granted in the Chamber of Deputies on March 3,\r\n1920, to all women 21 years of age, by vote of 120 to 37. All the\r\nCatholics voted in favor; all the Liberals but two against\r\nit--Burgomaster Max and Paul Hymans, Minister of Foreign Affairs; the\r\nSocialist vote was divided, 45 of the 56 in favor. It was accepted in\r\nthe Senate April 14 by 60 to 33.\r\n\r\nThe commission on revising the constitution refused by 11 to 9 votes\r\nto include the Parliamentary franchise for women but recommended\r\nunanimously their eligibility to sit in both chambers. This was\r\naccepted in June by the Deputies by 142 to 10 votes. On July 1 they\r\nrejected by a vote of 89 to 74 a bill giving the complete suffrage to\r\nwomen. On July 28 they voted by a large majority for a clause that\r\nany future Parliament might do this by a two-thirds vote without a\r\nrevision of the constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUXEMBURG.\r\n\r\nUnder the Treaty of Peace after the war Luxemburg became an\r\nindependent government with its own Parliament. There was a temporary\r\nConstituent Assembly and on May 8, 1919, without even an effort by\r\nwomen, this body adopted universal suffrage, without distinction of\r\nsex, by a vote of 39 to 11. All inhabitants 21 years of age are\r\nelectors and after 25 are eligible for the Parliament and Communal\r\nCouncils. On September 28 men and women voted on the country's future\r\nform of government and decided by a four-fifths vote to have an\r\nindependent monarchy with an elected Parliament. A month later the\r\nelections for it took place. One of the two women candidates was\r\nelected.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIA.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to relate the story of woman suffrage in Russia.\r\nIn the villages and among the peasants women had long voted at the\r\nlocal elections either as proxies of the husband or by right of owning\r\nproperty, and among the nobility and wealthy classes they could vote\r\nthrough male proxies. There was little national suffrage even among\r\nmen and the Revolution after the Russo-Japanese war was a struggle for\r\nrepresentation. In March, 1905, a Russian Union of Defenders of\r\nWomen's Rights was started in Moscow and spread among different\r\nclasses throughout Russia. It became a part of the general movement\r\nfor liberty, was well organized and its demands were many but the\r\nfirst one was for a Constituent Assembly elected by universal, secret\r\nballot. It united with the great political Union of Unions, which\r\nofficially recognized the equal rights of women in all respects in\r\nJuly, 1905, and before the end of the year this had been done by many\r\nmunicipalities.\r\n\r\nEverything was stopped by the Revolution and that was followed by the\r\nestablishment of the Douma. All that women hoped for from it was\r\nwrecked when it was dissolved. Their Union at this time had 79\r\nbranches and 10,000 members and had collected and used $50,000 for\r\nits work. The struggle was continued but two years later not 1,000\r\nmembers could be found. In December, 1908, the first Women's Congress\r\nin Russia was held in St. Petersburg, welcomed by the Mayor and\r\naddressed by members of Parliament and eminent women, and was\r\nfavorably received. Many women's societies were formed but worked\r\nunder great difficulties. Woman suffrage bills came before the Douma\r\nand it passed one giving the Municipal franchise, after striking out\r\neligibility, but the Czar did not sign it. A bill for adult suffrage\r\nwas taken up and Professor Miliukov made a brilliant plea for\r\nenfranchising women but it was not passed and the suffrage had not\r\nbeen granted to women at the beginning of the war in 1914.\r\n\r\nIn the second revolution in 1917 women took practically the same part\r\nas men and in the Provisional Government which was the result there\r\nwas no question as to their equal rights in suffrage and office\r\nholding. They were elected to the City Council of St. Petersburg and\r\nput on all public committees. Then came the counter revolution and\r\nchaos. From the beginning of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance\r\nin 1904 Russian delegates, women of great ability, had come to its\r\ncongresses with their reports but at the first meeting after the war,\r\nin Geneva in 1920, there was no word. When Russia eventually secures a\r\nstable government it probably will make no distinction between the\r\npolitical rights of men and women.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMANY.\r\n\r\nWhen the International Woman Suffrage Alliance met in Budapest in\r\nJune, 1913, delegates were present from affiliated societies in\r\ntwenty-one countries; national associations from several had applied\r\nfor admission and committees had been formed in several others. Over a\r\nhundred fraternal delegates were sent from organizations in twelve\r\ncountries having woman suffrage as one of their objects or as the only\r\none. In every direction the prospect looked encouraging and then one\r\nyear later the great War burst upon the world! The first thought of\r\nthe suffrage leaders was that the work of years had been swept away\r\nand after the War it would have to be commenced again. They did not\r\ndream that as a result of the War would come victories for equal\r\nsuffrage that it would have required many years to win. These\r\nvictories began with the enfranchisement of the women of Great Britain\r\nand Ireland in February, 1918, as described in another chapter, the\r\ndirect result of the War. On the Continent woman suffrage came first\r\nwhere it had been least expected--in Germany and Austro-Hungary. In\r\nsome of the German States women landowners could vote by male proxies.\r\nEach of the 22 States had its own King and Parliament and made its own\r\nlaws and all men of 25 could vote for the Reichstag or Lower House of\r\nthe Imperial Parliament but this privilege was largely nullified by a\r\nsystem of plural voting. In Prussia and Bavaria, the two largest\r\nStates, women were not allowed to attend political meetings or form\r\npolitical organizations, and those for suffrage came under this head.\r\nThe first attempt to form a suffrage society was made in Hamburg, one\r\nof the three \"free cities,\" in 1901 and it was followed by others in\r\nthe other two \"free cities,\" Frankfort and Bremen, and in the southern\r\nStates, where these restrictions did not exist. In 1902 these\r\nsocieties were united in a National Association, of which Dr. Anita\r\nAugspurg was president. Its members kept up an agitation for the\r\nMunicipal vote, carrying the question into the courts, and they also\r\npetitioned the Reichstag for the full suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe International Council of Women met in Berlin in 1904, the largest\r\nmeeting of women ever held in any country, and the organizing at this\r\ntime of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance aroused universal\r\ninterest. In the election of the new Reichstag in 1906 the suffrage\r\nsocieties took an active part and in 1907 it repealed the old law\r\nforbidding women to attend political meetings and form political\r\nassociations, the new law going into effect in May, 1908. The\r\nsuffragists celebrated with an immense meeting in Frankfort, addressed\r\nby Mrs. Pethick Lawrence and Miss Annie Kenney of England, who roused\r\ngreat enthusiasm. Suffrage associations were then organized in the\r\nvarious States, which began to work with their own Parliaments.\r\nThrough lectures, literature and organizing the effort was continued,\r\nthe women joining and working with the political parties, especially\r\nthe Social Democratic, which espoused their cause. In 1912 forty\r\npetitions for the Municipal suffrage in Prussia were presented to its\r\nDiet by women. A Woman's Congress was held in Munich and for the first\r\ntime in Germany a procession of women marched through the streets. In\r\n1911 differences in questions of policy which had been increasing had\r\nresulted in the forming of a second National Association. The two\r\nunited in 1916 under the presidency of Mrs. Marie Stritt, former\r\npresident of the National Council of Women of Germany and secretary of\r\nthe International Alliance. In March, 1918, Mrs. Stritt wrote to the\r\n_International Suffrage News_: \"We German women have at present no\r\nreason to rejoice over the progress of our cause but we have followed\r\nwith all the greater joy the unexpected success of our sisters in\r\nother countries.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1920 Mrs. Stritt, now a member of the city council in Dresden,\r\nwrote for this History as follows: \"Although throughout the more than\r\nfour years of war the women worked eagerly for the suffrage through\r\ntheir organizations, demanding it in public meetings and petitioning\r\nlegislative bodies, they did not get it by their own efforts but by\r\nthe Revolution in November, 1918, at the end of the war. In August,\r\n1919, their rights were confirmed unanimously by all parties in the\r\nnew constitution. They received the suffrage and eligibility for the\r\nReichstag, and for the Parliaments of the States and local\r\nbodies--universal, equal, direct and secret and applied exactly on the\r\nsame terms as to men. Women are by the constitution eligible to all\r\nState and Government offices. In the first elections, in January,\r\n1920, 39 were elected to the National Assembly, 117 to the State\r\nParliaments in Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, etc., and 1,400 to local\r\nbodies. Twenty were elected to the Diet of Prussia.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Alice Salamon, of Berlin, secretary of the International Council\r\nof Women, wrote: \"From the first day of the Revolution, when suffrage\r\nwas proclaimed for all men and women from the age of 20, it was\r\naccepted as the most natural thing in the world. It was neither\r\nquestioned nor opposed by any political or professional groups. All\r\npolitical parties resolutely accepted woman suffrage as a fact and\r\nissued electoral platforms in which they declared themselves for the\r\nfull partnership of women in political life.\"\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1919 the National Union for Woman Suffrage held a\r\nconvention in Erfurt and by unanimous vote dissolved, considering that\r\nits work had been accomplished. The members then devoted their efforts\r\nto abolishing the many legal, civil and social discriminations against\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUSTRIA.\r\n\r\nThe situation in Austria was much the same as in Germany except that\r\nfrom a very early date women taxpayers had some small franchise\r\nrights, but in 1906, when by a peaceful revolution men secured\r\nuniversal suffrage for themselves, the new constitution took even\r\nthose away from women which they had. Although large numbers of women\r\nhad stood shoulder to shoulder with the Progressives and Social\r\nDemocrats in their struggle for suffrage, when the latter succeeded in\r\ngetting control of both branches of the Parliament they refused to\r\ngrant any voting rights to women. The Austrian Government had never\r\nallowed women to attend political meetings or form suffrage societies.\r\nIt was not until 1905 that they dared even to form a Woman Suffrage\r\nCommittee and while the men were demanding their own rights it sent a\r\npetition to the Parliament that these should be granted to women also.\r\nIn 1907, after the new régime was under way, they sent another\r\npetition signed by 4,000 men and women asking for the repeal of the\r\nabove obnoxious law. It was refused and the Supreme Court sustained\r\nthe refusal.\r\n\r\nThe women did not relax their efforts. Mass meetings were held in\r\nVienna and the provincial capitals under the auspices of the Woman\r\nSuffrage Committee and other committees were formed. They published a\r\nmonthly paper and many of the newspapers took up their cause. In 1910\r\nthey sent a deputation to the Premier and Minister of Internal\r\nAffairs, which was sympathetically received, and the latter said that\r\nnot only ought the law to be repealed but women should have the\r\nMunicipal franchise. A Socialist Deputy brought the matter of the law\r\nbefore the Constitutional Committee, which reported it to the Chamber,\r\nwhere the sentiment was almost unanimous for its repeal. It went to\r\nthe Upper House but before it could be sanctioned the Parliament was\r\ndissolved. In the autumn of 1913 a new Law of Assemblies was passed\r\nfrom which the section so bitterly opposed was omitted and in fact the\r\nwomen had been defying it. They began at once a nation-wide suffrage\r\norganization, which affiliated with the International Alliance. The\r\nnext year the country was immersed in a World War which continued over\r\nfour years. At the end of it the Government passed into the hands of\r\nthe people. The new constitution provided that all women over 20\r\nshould have full suffrage and eligibility to all offices, national and\r\nState, on the same terms as men. For the first elections the following\r\nFebruary the Austrian Union of Suffrage Societies and the National\r\nCouncil of Women worked together and it was estimated that 2,000,000\r\nwomen voted; eight were elected to the National Constituent Assembly,\r\ntwelve to the city council of Vienna and 126 to other municipal\r\ncouncils.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUNGARY.\r\n\r\nWomen were not prohibited from political activities in Hungary as in\r\nAustria and when the International Woman Suffrage Alliance was formed\r\nin Berlin in 1904 Rosika Schwimmer came from Budapest with a report\r\nthat in 1900 Francis Kossuth and Louis Hentaller were advocating woman\r\nsuffrage in the Parliament and in 1903 women were working with men for\r\npolitical reforms. By 1905 a Woman Suffrage Association was formed,\r\nauxiliary to the International, mass meetings were held and petitions\r\nwere sent to the Parliament. In 1906 Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, the\r\ninternational president, and Dr. Aletta Jacobs, president of the\r\nNetherlands National Association, visited Budapest and addressed\r\nenthusiastic meetings. Later Baroness Alexandra Gripenberg of Finland\r\nand Mrs. Dora Montefiore of England did the same. Strenuous agitation\r\nwas kept up, meetings, processions, demonstrations, and half a million\r\nleaflets were distributed. The Government was to discuss a Reform Bill\r\nin 1908 and a determined effort was made to keep the women out of the\r\nHouse of Parliament as spectators. Mrs. Catt paid another visit that\r\nyear and gave ten lectures in eight cities. Eloquent women speakers\r\nwent to the aid of the Hungarian women from Berlin, Munich, Berne,\r\nTurin and Rotterdam. In 1910 the conservative National Council of\r\nWomen added a woman suffrage committee and a Men's League for Woman\r\nSuffrage of representative men was formed. There were suffrage\r\nsocieties in 87 cities and towns composed of all classes. The women\r\nwere badly treated by all political parties and excluded from their\r\nmeetings, the Radicals and Social Democrats being their strongest\r\nopponents. The struggle continued with sometimes a favorable and\r\nsometimes an unfavorable Government and always the contest by men for\r\ntheir own universal suffrage.\r\n\r\nIn 1913, through the remarkable efforts of Rosika Schwimmer, the\r\nInternational Suffrage Alliance held its congress in Budapest with\r\ndelegates from all over the world. It was a notable triumph, welcomed\r\nby the dignitaries of the State and city; its meetings for seven days\r\ncrowded to overflowing and every possible courtesy extended. The\r\ndemand that women should have the vote seemed to have become\r\nuniversal. Then came the War and all was blotted out for years. When\r\nit was over in 1918 internal revolution followed and out of it came a\r\nRepublic but without stability. A law was enacted giving suffrage to\r\nall men of 21 but only to women of 24 who could read and write. Women\r\nvoted under it in 1919 and one was elected to the Parliament but the\r\nlaw has not yet been written into a permanent constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOHEMIA.\r\n\r\nBohemian women suffered the disadvantages of those of Austria and\r\ncould not attend political meetings or form suffrage societies,\r\nalthough by an old law taxpayers and those belonging to the learned\r\nprofessions could vote by a male proxy for the members of the Diet of\r\nthe Kingdom, and were eligible themselves after the age of 30. They\r\nhad a Woman Suffrage Committee and petitioned the Diet to include\r\nwomen in the new electoral law of 1907 but it received word from\r\nVienna that nothing must be done. By 1911 a Woman Suffrage Committee\r\nwas doing a good deal of active suffrage work and women's\r\norganizations were being formed in the political parties but the\r\nSocial Democratic was the only one that favored equal suffrage. For a\r\nnumber of years the women endeavored to secure the nomination of a\r\nwoman candidate for the Bohemian Diet but were always unsuccessful.\r\nFinally in 1912 the Social Democratic and a section of the Liberal\r\nparty each nominated a woman and by the most heroic effort and a\r\ncombination of fortunate circumstances the latter, Mrs.\r\nVikova-Kuneticka, a prominent writer and suffragist, was elected on\r\nJune 13. The Governor of the district, doubting her eligibility,\r\ndelayed issuing the certificate; the Diet did not meet; the War came\r\non and after it ended Bohemia assumed her own government with equal\r\nrights for women, and she took her seat.\r\n\r\nIn the newly organized country of Czecho-Slovakia woman suffrage\r\nprevailed throughout and in 1920 thirteen women were elected to the\r\nLower and three to the Upper House of the National Parliament. The new\r\nParliament of Jugo-Slavia voted against woman suffrage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is practically impossible to give an accurate account of the\r\nsituation in regard to the suffrage and office-holding of women in the\r\nre-alignment which took place in central and southeastern Europe after\r\nthe war. The States which were formed with new or changed boundaries\r\nall began with the declaration of absolute democracy, equal suffrage\r\nfor men and women and eligibility to all offices. At their first\r\nelections women in some of them were elected to the Parliaments and\r\ncity councils of the new régime. Poland, restored, gave universal\r\nsuffrage, and elected eight to the Parliament. Its women are strongly\r\norganized and very capable. It is not possible to foretell the future\r\nof these experiments in democracy. It has been reported from time to\r\ntime that the suffrage had been given to women in Bulgaria, Roumania\r\nand Serbia and then denied but at present they do not seem to be\r\nexercising it. (1920.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSWITZERLAND.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland, like France, is a republic only in name, as women are\r\nwholly disfranchised. It is now the only country where the question of\r\nwoman suffrage has to be submitted to the individual voters. To give\r\nwomen the franchise for the Federal Council that body must submit the\r\nquestion to all the voters, and to give it in each Canton of the 22\r\nfor its Council, this body must submit the question to all the voters\r\nin the Canton. It never has been submitted by the Federal Council,\r\nwhich holds that it must first be granted in the Cantons. Whenever\r\nthey have voted on it they have defeated it, the agricultural\r\npopulation being especially hostile. There are many organizations of\r\nwomen, the most important of which ask for the suffrage. The largest\r\nof them, the National Council of Women, with 20,000 members from all\r\nkinds of societies, was very slow to recognize the value of the vote\r\nbut in January, 1919, when a revision of the constitution was\r\nexpected, it took official action and unanimously adopted suffrage\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nMme. Chaponnière-Chaix (who is now president of the International\r\nCouncil of Women), Mme. Saulner and Mlle. Camille Vidart were present\r\nat the forming of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance in Berlin\r\nin 1904 to represent a group in Geneva. In May, 1908, a Central Woman\r\nSuffrage Committee was formed in Berne of societies in seven cities\r\nand it was admitted to membership in the Alliance. In January, 1909, a\r\nNational Association was organized with M. de Morsier, a Deputy of the\r\nCouncil of the Geneva Canton, as president and lectures and organizing\r\ncommenced. The work was continued and small gains were made. Vaud,\r\nGeneva, Neuchâtel, Bâle-Ville and Berne gave women a vote in the\r\nState church. They can sit on school boards in these Cantons\r\nand Zurich. They can vote for and serve on the tribunaux de\r\nprud'hommes--industrial boards--in two or three Cantons, these rights\r\ngranted by the Councils. The universities and the professions are open\r\nto women.\r\n\r\nWork for woman suffrage was at an end during the War and after it was\r\nover there was not the disposition to enfranchise women that prevailed\r\nin other countries of Europe but it was taken up by the liberal\r\nparties. The suffragists entered upon vigorous efforts to have the\r\nrights of women included in the proposed revision of the national\r\nconstitution. On March 17, 1919, in response to large petitions, the\r\nCouncil of Neuchâtel by a vote of 60 to 30 submitted the question of\r\nwoman suffrage to the voters. In June the National Suffrage\r\nAssociation held its annual meeting in this Canton with a large\r\nattendance and its president, Mlle. Emily Gourd, gave an account of an\r\nactive year's work. A petition signed by 157 women's societies asked\r\nthe Federal Council to put woman suffrage in the revised national\r\nconstitution. There was a spirit of hopefulness that a new régime was\r\nat hand, as many Cantons were considering the question.\r\n\r\nThe vote was taken in Neuchâtel June 28, 29, 1919. A dishonorable\r\ncampaign had been made by the opponents, financed by the liquor trade,\r\nand the result in the entire Canton was 12,017 noes, 5,346 ayes. In\r\nthe town it stood 1,647 noes, 831 ayes; in the industrial and\r\nSocialist town of Chaux de Fonds it was 2,400 noes, 1,800 ayes. The\r\nFederal Council refused all appeals to submit the question, although\r\nit was discussed in the First Chamber. In October the Council of Basle\r\nby 63 to 24 voted to submit the proposition. The Council of Zurich\r\nalso sent it to the voters, adding eligibility to office. On February\r\n8, 1920, the vote in the Canton of Zurich was 88,249 noes; 21,608\r\nayes. In that of Basle it was 12,455 noes; 6,711 ayes. The peasants\r\nwere solidly opposed and the workingmen voted against it.\r\n\r\nThe suffragists then concentrated upon Geneva and set out to get a\r\npetition from 2,500 electors, which would compel the Council of the\r\nCanton to submit the proposition. In June, 1920, the International\r\nWoman Suffrage Alliance held in Geneva its first congress after the\r\nwar. Delegates were present from all over the civilized world.\r\nTwenty-one countries had now enfranchised women. From every point of\r\nview it was one of the most successful it had ever held and it was\r\nexpected to influence the referendum on woman suffrage. The year was\r\ncrowded with work and the 2,500 names were not obtained until\r\nNovember. It was February, 1921, before the Council of the Canton\r\ndiscussed the petition and then it was referred to a Special\r\nCommission, where it was held until September 21 before the proposal\r\nto give full suffrage and eligibility to women was submitted to the\r\nvoters. The election took place October 17 and resulted in 14,166\r\nnoes; 6,629 ayes.\r\n\r\n\r\nITALY.\r\n\r\nWoman suffrage in some form had been a number of times before the\r\nItalian Parliament and it was advocated by many of the eminent\r\nuniversity women. At the first congress of the International Woman\r\nSuffrage Alliance in Copenhagen in 1906 Professor Teresa Labriola, a\r\nlecturer on law in the University of Rome, came to tell of efforts\r\nduring the past year to awaken interest in the question of votes for\r\nwomen, due largely to the demand of men for universal suffrage. Some\r\nwomen had tried to have their names placed on the election lists, as\r\nthe electoral law did not prohibit it, but the courts decided against\r\nthem. A petition signed by a large number of women was presented to\r\nthe House of Deputies and some of these advocated a law to give women\r\nthe suffrage but Premier Giolitti held that full civil rights must\r\nfirst be given to them. In 1908 congresses of women were held,\r\ncommittees formed and a National Committee for Woman Suffrage was\r\nsufficiently organized to send a delegate to the meeting of the\r\nInternational Alliance in Amsterdam and be accepted as an auxiliary.\r\nLater it became a National Federation for Woman Suffrage. By 1909\r\nsuffrage committees had been established in many cities, public\r\nmeetings held and propaganda work done. The National Committee had\r\ntaken a very active part in the elections of March to have Deputies\r\nselected who favored giving the franchise to women, under the\r\ndirection of its president, Countess Giacinta Martini, and\r\nvice-president, Professor Labriola. The press was obliged to take up\r\nthe question, led by the _Giornale d'Italia_. In 1910 a Men's League\r\nfor Woman Suffrage was formed with a membership of prominent men. A\r\nbill was brought before the Chamber to abolish marital authority,\r\nadmit women to the legal profession and give them a vote in local\r\ngovernment. Premier Sonnino was in sympathy but his Cabinet fell.\r\n\r\nThe National Suffrage Union by 1912 had 10,000 members and took\r\nvigorous part in the municipal elections. As a result many Municipal\r\nCouncils adopted resolutions calling on the Deputies to pass a woman\r\nsuffrage bill. In 1912 the Chamber was discussing a bill to extend the\r\nvote to illiterate men and one was introduced to give it to women,\r\nwhich was defeated through the influence of Premier Giolitti, but the\r\nballoting showed that it was not a party question. His government was\r\ncontinued in power by a large vote at the next election. The King in\r\nopening Parliament promised a bill to give civil rights to women. The\r\nbreaking out of the War in 1914 ended all hope of favorable action but\r\nagitation and organization did not cease. Large suffrage congresses\r\nwere held in Rome in 1916 and 1917, the latter opened with an\r\neloquent address by Keeper of the Seals Sacchi, who was to introduce\r\na Reform Bill for women but it was not done.\r\n\r\nAfter the War Italy shared in the world-wide movement toward improving\r\nthe position of women. The long-delayed Sacchi bill was introduced. It\r\nvery largely removed the civil disabilities of women, which were many;\r\nabolished the authority of the husband, which was absolute; gave women\r\nthe right to control their property, enter the professions, fill\r\npublic offices and have equal guardianship of their children. On March\r\n25, 1919, the Senate Commission recommended the passing of the bill\r\nwithout change, which was done in July by a vote of 58 to 17. On April\r\n23, 29, 1920, an immense suffrage congress was held in Milan, opened\r\nby Dr. Margherita Ancona and addressed by prominent men of all\r\nparties. This was followed by others and there was a strong public\r\ndemand for the enfranchisement of women. A bill was presented July 30,\r\nsponsored by sixteen prominent Deputies of all parties, to give women\r\nthe vote on the same terms as men but they were not to use it until\r\nafter the approaching general election, as there would not be time to\r\nmake new lists. This Martini bill was referred to a special committee\r\nof Signor Martini, Signor Gasparotto and Signor Sandrini and it was\r\ndue to their excellent management that it went through with such speed\r\non September 6. It was favored by Premier Nitti, some brilliant\r\nspeeches were made and it passed by 174 ayes, 55 noes. Before the\r\ngreat rejoicing was over, before the bill could be acted on by the\r\nSenate, the Government was defeated and the Parliament was dissolved.\r\nItaly soon, like other European countries, was threatened with\r\nrevolution. Ministers rose and fell; politics was in a chaotic state.\r\nThis situation has continued to a considerable degree and women are\r\nstill without the suffrage (1921).\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\nFor many years there were detached groups in France working for\r\npolitical rights for women but it was not until 1909 that any effort\r\nat national organization was made. Then in February a National\r\nCommittee was formed of one member from each society with Mme. Jeanne\r\nE. Schmahl, a well-known worker for the rights of women, as chairman.\r\nThe National Council of Women of France, an influential body, gave\r\nits assistance. Mme. Schmahl went to the meeting of the International\r\nWoman Suffrage Alliance in London the following April, which\r\nrecognized the committee as a National Association and accepted it as\r\nan auxiliary. It immediately began organizing branches in the\r\nProvinces, and received especial help from the universities.\r\nProfessional women, those in public service and wage-earning women\r\njoined the association, which soon had over 3,000 members. The right\r\nhad been given to working women to vote in the election of Trade\r\nCouncils. As far back as 1906 M. Dussaussoy had proposed a bill to the\r\nChamber of Deputies giving to all women a vote for Municipal, District\r\nand General Councils. In March, 1910, M. Buisson, chairman of the\r\nParliamentary Committee for Universal Suffrage, reported in favor of\r\nthis bill and added full suffrage. In June, at the request of the new\r\nassociation, 163 Deputies signed a petition that the report should be\r\ntaken up at once. A remarkable sentiment in favor was disclosed.\r\n\r\nMme. V. Vincent, a pioneer in the woman movement, became president of\r\nthe association, which was called the French Union for Woman Suffrage.\r\nBy the time the International Alliance held its congress in Budapest\r\nin June, 1913, Mme. Marguerite de Witt Schlumberger, a very capable\r\nexecutive, had been elected president and the report of the secretary,\r\nMme. C. V. Brunschvicg, of the progress made along many lines filled\r\nfive printed pages. The Municipal suffrage bill had been taken up by\r\nthe Chamber of Deputies in December, 1912, and then, as usually\r\nhappened in all countries, some electoral reform in the interest of\r\nmen crowded it out. The Union now numbered 10,000 members and held a\r\nnational meeting each year. More requests came for speakers than could\r\nbe answered.\r\n\r\nThe War begun in 1914 put an end to all hope of parliamentary action\r\nbut after it ended the expectation throughout the world was that the\r\nmagnificent courage and efficiency of French women during the\r\nfour-and-a-half years would be rewarded with full enfranchisement. The\r\nUnion took up the question at once and met the fullest cooperation in\r\nthe Chamber of Deputies. The debate opened in May, 1919, and continued\r\nthrough three sessions. It commenced with the bill for the Municipal\r\nfranchise but at the beginning of the third session this passed to an\r\namendment, conferring the same complete universal suffrage possessed\r\nby men. The Chamber was undecided when M. Viviani and M. Briand,\r\nformer Prime Ministers, in strong speeches called for the amendment.\r\nTheir powerful influence turned the scale and on May 20 by 377 ayes,\r\n97 noes, the Deputies voted for the amendment amidst the greatest\r\nenthusiasm. It had to be ratified by the Senate, a non-progressive\r\nbody not elected by popular vote but by District and Municipal\r\nCouncillors in each Commune.\r\n\r\nWith much anxiety the women turned to the Senate and after interviews\r\nwith individual members succeeded in obtaining a hearing before the\r\nCommission, or Committee, on Adult Suffrage, June 12. They presented\r\nan eloquent appeal, signed officially by the Union of Suffrage\r\nSocieties with 80 branches; the National Council of Women with 150 and\r\nseveral other large organizations of women, and gave a copy to each\r\nmember. It was received in cold silence and they knew that not more\r\nthan half-a-dozen of the 27 members were favorable. The elections were\r\napproaching and the commission would not report the subject to be\r\ndiscussed in the Senate. After the election the new Chamber of\r\nDeputies considered in September a proposal to the Senate to hold a\r\ndiscussion on the woman suffrage bill, which was passed by a vote of\r\n340 to 95. It had no effect and the commission not only refused to lay\r\nthe measure before the Senate but rejected one to give the franchise\r\nto woman relatives of the men who were killed in the war. The Radical\r\nmembers fear that to give women a vote would strengthen the power of\r\nthe Catholic church; the Conservatives fear that the political\r\nemancipation of women would diminish the influence of the clergy. Thus\r\nthe situation remains in the so-called Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER COUNTRIES IN EUROPE.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance in Geneva\r\nin 1920 the president, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, called attention in\r\nher address to the fact that Greece and Spain in Europe, Argentina and\r\nUruguay in South America and the island of Cuba had made enough\r\nprogress in organization for woman suffrage within a few years to be\r\naccepted as auxiliaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREECE. While the Peace Treaty was being framed at Paris in 1919\r\nPremier Venizelos received a deputation of leading suffragists from\r\nmany countries, expressed his sympathy with the movement and gave them\r\nthe names of women in Athens with whom to take up the question of\r\norganization. On Jan. 23, 1920, he stated to the Parliament in Greece\r\nthat the Government was prepared to give the suffrage to women as soon\r\nas they to some extent requested it. This was followed in March by the\r\nforming in Athens of a League for the Rights of Women and later by\r\nbranches in Crete, Thessaly and Corfu. A petition for political and\r\ncivic rights, in which other societies of women joined, was sent to\r\nthe Parliament. The Lyceum Club, one of the oldest and most\r\ninfluential in Greece, arranged a great congress of women to meet in\r\nOctober to consider measures for the advancement of women along all\r\nlines, including that of suffrage. Then the Venizelos Government was\r\noverthrown by a plebiscite, the King returned and the congress was\r\ndeferred until April, 1921. At that time a hundred societies of women\r\nsent delegates. It was opened by Premier Gounaris and the King and\r\nQueen were present. Woman suffrage was the leading feature and several\r\nCabinet Ministers announced the intention of the Government to confer\r\nit. Queen Sophia decorated Madame Parron, president of the congress,\r\nand thanked her for devoting her life to the progress of Greek women.\r\nThere have been the usual delays but the women will probably be\r\nenfranchised in the not distant future.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPAIN. The women of Spain labor under great disadvantages in trying to\r\nobtain the franchise, as the Catholic church, which is all-powerful,\r\nis not in favor of it. The King and Queen are friendly and a number of\r\nthe statesmen are ready to assist. The Cabinet in 1919 proposed a bill\r\nwhich would give a vote to all women over 23 years old and it was\r\nplaced on the program of the Republican party. There are eight or ten\r\nsuffrage societies in different cities united in a Supreme Feminist\r\nCouncil, which holds congresses and has presented to the Parliament\r\npetitions signed by thousands of women asking for complete political\r\nand legal equality. It is an auxiliary of the International Alliance.\r\n\r\nThere have been attempts to organize for woman suffrage in Portugal.\r\nTravellers in various districts of Turkey report that in some of them\r\nwomen are permitted to vote and hold office.\r\n\r\nBefore the outbreak of the War there was some suffrage among the\r\nproperty owning women in the Jewish colonization of Palestine. After\r\nit was taken by General Allenby the Jewish Provisional Assembly called\r\nto arrange for a National Constituent Assembly provided that women as\r\nwell as men should vote for it. There was opposition from the orthodox\r\nbut the liberal element prevailed. They vote and belong to the\r\npolitical organizations and also have their own, which work for the\r\nimprovement of the civil and legal position of women. They have united\r\nin a national organization and become auxiliary to the International\r\nWoman Suffrage Alliance. Women have been elected to city councils and\r\neven to the National Assembly.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt visited China in 1912 she found that\r\nwomen had taken part in the revolution and not only had voted for the\r\nnew Parliament but had been elected to it. These privileges were\r\nafterwards taken away but they organized societies to get them again.\r\nMrs. Catt kept in touch with these societies and in 1913 they were\r\naccepted as auxiliary to the Alliance. They are still keeping up the\r\nstruggle for political rights.\r\n\r\nThere is only the nucleus of a movement for woman suffrage in Japan\r\nbut some of the statesmen favor it and women's societies petition for\r\nit. Under the auspices of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union a\r\nbeginning has been made toward organization. Women are not allowed to\r\nattend political meetings and their position is very restricted but\r\nthis year (1921) they have done a great deal of public work for peace.\r\nThe Japanese Government is progressing rapidly and the results will\r\neventually be seen in an improved status of women.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH AMERICA. Women occupy an advanced position in Argentina in\r\neducation, in business and in organized work. They have had during the\r\npast twenty years an excellent training through the National Council\r\nof Women and they have exercised much influence in public affairs.\r\nThey were slow in entering the movement for woman suffrage but by 1920\r\nthey were sufficiently organized under the presidency of Dr. Alicia\r\nMoreau, to send a representative to the congress of the International\r\nAlliance in Geneva in June and be received as an auxiliary. Large\r\nmeetings have been held in Buenos Aires. There is much favorable\r\nsentiment in the Parliament, where bills have been introduced.\r\n\r\nThe woman suffrage movement is well advanced in Uruguay under the\r\npresidency of Dr. Paulina Luisi, who attended the Geneva congress,\r\nwhere her association entered the International Alliance. The\r\npresident of the Republic, Dr. Baltaser Brum, is an ardent advocate of\r\nwoman's enfranchisement and is using his best efforts for it. A bill\r\nwas introduced by Dr. Aralya for the complete emancipation of women,\r\nwhich did not pass. Later one for the Municipal franchise was\r\npresented by Deputy Alfco Brum, brother of the president, which it is\r\nbelieved will ultimately be accepted. There is a suffrage society in\r\nChili, one in Paraguay and one in Brazil, where the Senate in 1920\r\ndefeated a bill.\r\n\r\nThe Central American Constituent Assembly, the legislative body of the\r\nnew Federation of Central American States, has approved woman\r\nsuffrage. There is to be a Pan American Suffrage Congress of Women in\r\nthe United States in 1922, which doubtless will give a great impetus\r\nto the cause in the Central and South American countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEXICO. The constitution made for Mexico after the last revolution\r\ngave the suffrage to all citizens without distinction of sex and women\r\nhave voted in Yucatan but the elections throughout the country have\r\nnot been settled enough for them to exercise their right. There are\r\nsuffrage societies among the different classes of women and the\r\nwage-earners are especially insistent on having a voice in the\r\nGovernment. The President is quoted as having said that the time when\r\nwomen will vote is near at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[220] The History is indebted for the material in this division to\r\nMiss Annie Furuhjelm of Helsingfors, member of Parliament,\r\nvice-president of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance and\r\npresident of the Woman's Alliance Union of Finland formed in 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\nTHE INTERNATIONAL WOMAN SUFFRAGE ALLIANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn international association of the groups of women in various\r\ncountries who were working to obtain the suffrage was for many years\r\nthe strong desire of Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Miss Susan B.\r\nAnthony, two leaders of the movement in the United States. When,\r\nhowever, in the early eighties the first steps were taken they found\r\nthat Great Britain was the only one with organizations for this\r\npurpose. They visited there in 1883-4 and found so much sympathy with\r\nthe idea that a committee was appointed to cooperate with one in the\r\nUnited States in arranging for an International Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation.[221] It was decided as a first step to hold an\r\nInternational Suffrage Convention but after a correspondence which\r\nextended through several years, because of the difficulty of getting\r\nin touch with women in the different countries who were interested, it\r\nwas considered advisable to broaden the scope of the undertaking and\r\ncall an International Congress of Women engaged in all kinds of work\r\nfor the general welfare. This was held in Washington, D. C., in March,\r\n1888, under the auspices of the National Suffrage Association and was\r\nthe largest convention of women which had ever taken place up to that\r\ntime. It resulted in a permanent International Council of Women, which\r\nin a few years established a Standing Committee on Suffrage and Rights\r\nof Citizenship with Dr. Anna Howard Shaw as chairman. The National\r\nCouncils in all countries formed auxiliary committees and made woman\r\nsuffrage a part of their program and it had a prominent place at the\r\nNational and International Congresses. The woman suffrage leaders in\r\nthe United States did not abandon the idea of an affiliation of the\r\nsocieties which were forming in many lands for the specific purpose of\r\nobtaining the franchise but no further steps toward it were taken.\r\n\r\nFrom the time Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt became officially connected\r\nwith the National Association in 1905 a dominant thought with her was\r\nthat there should be an international suffrage association. Miss\r\nAnthony resigned the presidency in 1900 and Mrs. Catt became her\r\nsuccessor. She presented her idea to Miss Anthony, who told her of the\r\nearly efforts and encouraged her to apply her great organizing ability\r\nto the undertaking, feeling that she was fitted for it above all\r\nothers. Mrs. Catt at once began the preliminary work and after two\r\nyears of correspondence the officers of the National American Woman\r\nSuffrage Association issued an invitation for an International\r\nConference to be held in Washington, D. C., at the time of its annual\r\nconvention in February, 1902. This conference took place and was\r\nattended by delegates from many countries. A part of their interesting\r\nand valuable addresses before the convention and committees of\r\nCongress will be found in Chapter II of Volume V. The official\r\nproceedings of the conference are condensed from the Minutes as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nMrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, president of the National American Woman\r\nSuffrage Association, called the meeting to order and gave a brief\r\nhistory of the correspondence conducted with the officers of women's\r\nassociations of various kinds concerning an International Woman\r\nSuffrage Conference. She reported that ten countries would be\r\nrepresented by delegates--England, Australia, Canada, Norway, Sweden,\r\nGermany, Russia, Turkey, Chile and the United States. She expressed\r\nregret that unforseen circumstances at the last moment prevented the\r\nattendance of the Canadian delegation but stated that James L. Hughes,\r\nInspector of Public Schools in Toronto, would attend and report on the\r\nposition of women in Canada.\r\n\r\nThe United States association had appointed four delegates and it had\r\nbeen hoped that each country would send four but no country had sent\r\nmore than one. The meeting was asked to select a chairman and on\r\nmotion of Mrs. Fenwick Miller, seconded by Mrs. Drewson, Miss Susan B.\r\nAnthony was unanimously chosen and took the chair. Miss Vida Goldstein\r\nwas elected recording secretary.\r\n\r\nThe following delegates responded to the roll call: Mrs. Florence\r\nMiller, England; Miss Vida Goldstein, Australia; Mrs. Sofja Levovna\r\nFriedland, Russia; Mrs. Gudrun Drewson, Norway; Miss Florence Fensham,\r\nTurkey; Miss Susan B. Anthony, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, the Rev. Anna\r\nHoward Shaw, Mrs. Rachel Foster Avery, United States. Mrs. Catt\r\nannounced that a delegate from Germany, Miss Antonie Stolle; one from\r\nChile, Miss Carolina Huidobro, and one from Sweden, Mrs. Emmy Evald,\r\nwould arrive later. A committee of five was appointed to consider a\r\nplan for international cooperation--Mrs. Miller, Mrs. Avery, Miss\r\nStolle, Mrs. Drewson, Miss Goldstein. At another session its\r\nrecommendations were read and adopted as follows:\r\n\r\n1. That it is desirable to form an International Woman Suffrage\r\nCommittee for the purpose of acting as a central bureau for the\r\ncollection, exchange and dissemination of information concerning the\r\nmethods of suffrage work and the general status of women in the\r\nvarious countries having representation on the committee.\r\n\r\n2. That the delegates to the conference be instructed to ask their\r\nrespective societies to appoint three representatives to act on such a\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\n3. That in the event of societies declining to cooperate, the\r\ndelegates be authorized to form a separate International Committee in\r\ntheir respective countries.\r\n\r\n4. That the secretary of the International Committee be instructed to\r\ncommunicate with known suffragists in countries not represented in\r\nthis conference and to recommend cooperation with the international\r\norganization....\r\n\r\nThe delegates were unanimously of the opinion that the above temporary\r\nform of organization would result in most satisfactory international\r\ncooperation. It was held that each nation should be given free\r\nopportunity to aid in the forming of the permanent organization and\r\nthat the present needs would be best served by a temporary\r\nInternational Committee. It was agreed that the next International\r\nWoman Suffrage Conference should be called in Berlin in 1904, in\r\nconnection with the Quinquennial Meeting of the International Council\r\nof Women, and that meantime each nation should be asked to consider\r\nthis movement and send delegates fully instructed as to the best form\r\nof a permanent international organization.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony was elected permanent chairman; Mrs. Catt, secretary;\r\nMrs. Fenwick Miller, treasurer. Mrs. Catt moved that as an\r\nInternational Association was not yet permanently organized, each\r\ncountry should be asked to contribute something toward the general\r\nworking expenses of printing, postage, etc., but the financial\r\nobligation should be left to its own discretion. It was decided that\r\nthe plan of organization adopted by the conference be read to the\r\nconvention of the National Suffrage Association then in session. To\r\nmake the conference still more international in character a\r\nvice-chairman representing Germany was added and the appointment was\r\nleft to the German societies. It was arranged that the committee\r\nshould hold office till the meeting in Berlin. It was moved by Mrs.\r\nFriedland, seconded by Miss Fensham, that the foreign delegates accord\r\ntheir warmest thanks to the National American Suffrage Association for\r\ninviting them to the International Conference and for the many\r\nkindnesses shown them.\r\n\r\nMrs. Catt had sent out a list of twenty-eight questions to most of the\r\ncountries and she reported that answers had been received from\r\nthirty-two. These questions covered property rights of women,\r\noccupations, wages, education, guardianship of children, divorce,\r\noffice holding, suffrage and other legal and civil rights. The full\r\nand comprehensive answers, some of them from Consuls and other\r\ngovernment representatives, were published in the official report of\r\nthe conference and formed an invaluable collection of facts and\r\nstatistics such as had never before been made. They gave a striking\r\nobject lesson in the strong necessity for women to have a voice in the\r\nlaws and the governments under which they live.\r\n\r\nIt had been suggested by Mrs. Catt that this conference should\r\nconsider issuing a Declaration of Principles, expressing briefly the\r\ndemand for independence and individuality which women are making\r\ntoday. Mrs. Fenwick Miller warmly supported the suggestion and a\r\ncommittee of three was appointed to draw it up--Mrs. Avery, Mrs. Evald\r\nand Miss Fensham. As finally submitted, discussed and accepted it\r\nformed the platform of the international organization and was adopted\r\nat each meeting for some years afterwards. It was called a Declaration\r\nof Principles and read as follows:\r\n\r\n     1. Men and women are born equally free and independent members of\r\n     the human race, equally endowed with intelligence and ability and\r\n     equally entitled to the free exercise of their individual rights\r\n     and liberty.\r\n\r\n     2. The natural relation of the sexes is that of inter-dependence\r\n     and cooperation and the repression of the rights and liberty of\r\n     one sex inevitably works injury to the other and hence to the\r\n     whole race.\r\n\r\n     3. In all lands those laws, creeds and customs which have tended\r\n     to restrict women to a position of dependence, to discourage\r\n     their education, to impede the development of their natural gifts\r\n     and to subordinate their individuality have been based upon false\r\n     theories and have produced an artificial and unjust relation of\r\n     the sexes in modern society.\r\n\r\n     4. Self-government in the home and the State is the inalienable\r\n     right of every normal adult and the refusal of this right to\r\n     women has resulted in social, legal and economic injustice to\r\n     them and has also intensified the existing economic disturbances\r\n     throughout the world.\r\n\r\n     5. Governments which impose taxes and laws upon their women\r\n     citizens without giving them the right of consent or dissent\r\n     which is granted to men citizens exercise a tyranny inconsistent\r\n     with just government.\r\n\r\n     6. The ballot is the only legal and permanent means of defending\r\n     the right to \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\"\r\n     pronounced inalienable by the American Declaration of\r\n     Independence and accepted as inalienable by all civilized\r\n     nations. In any representative form of government, therefore,\r\n     women should be vested with all the political rights and\r\n     privileges of electors.\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION OF THE ALLIANCE.\r\n\r\nThe International Woman Suffrage Committee, which had been formed at a\r\nconference in Washington, D. C., in February, 1902, and adjourned to\r\nmeet in Berlin in June, 1904, was called to order on June 3, in the\r\nPrince Albert Hotel by the chairman, Miss Susan B. Anthony, who was\r\nwarmly greeted by the women of all countries. The following report of\r\nthis and subsequent meetings is condensed from the Minutes:\r\n\r\nThe program arranged by the officers was adopted as the order of\r\nbusiness. Dr. jur. Anita Augsburg of the German Suffrage Association\r\ndelivered a cordial address of welcome and Miss Anthony, in behalf of\r\nthe visiting delegates, responded. Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt presented\r\na gavel from the women of Wyoming, who have enjoyed the right of full\r\nsuffrage longer than any other women in the world.\r\n\r\nDr. phil. Käthe Schirmacher of Germany was appointed official\r\ninterpreter; Miss Adelheid von Welczeck of Germany was made assistant\r\nsecretary and was also appointed on the committee on credentials with\r\nDr. Aletta Jacobs of Holland and Miss Edith Palliser of England. The\r\nroll call of nations showed delegates from the United States, Great\r\nBritain, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, Hungary,\r\nNew Zealand and Germany.\r\n\r\nGuests and delegates from countries where no organization was\r\naffiliated with the International Committee were given the privileges\r\nof the conference except the vote. The Declaration of Principles was\r\nread and Dr. Schirmacher and Mlle. Camille Vidart of Switzerland were\r\nappointed to translate it into German and French for discussion. Dr.\r\nAugspurg read telegrams of greeting and good will from the French\r\ndelegates, who were prevented from attending the conference.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed that the name of the new association be the\r\nInternational Woman Suffrage Alliance and a motion by Dr. Anna Howard\r\nShaw (U. S. A.) that Miss Anthony be declared its first member was\r\ncarried amid cheers. It was moved by Mrs. Lucretia L. Blankenburg of\r\nPhiladelphia and unanimously carried that Miss Mary S. Anthony be the\r\nsecond member. It was voted that those delegates at the first\r\nconference in Washington who were not now present be invited to stand\r\nalso as charter members of the permanent Alliance. The opportunity was\r\nthen given for the affiliation of honorary associates and the\r\nfollowing were accepted: Wilhelmine Sheriff Bain and Isabel Napier,\r\nNew Zealand; Miss Anna Hude, Mrs. Charlotte Norrie, Mrs. Johanne\r\nMünter, Copenhagen; Mrs. Friederike von Mekler Traunwies, Austria;\r\nLeopold Katscher, Hungary; Mme. Chaponniere-Chaix, Mlle. Vidart,\r\nSwitzerland.\r\n\r\nThe object of the Alliance was declared to be \"to secure the\r\nenfranchisement of the women of all nations and to unite the friends\r\nof woman suffrage throughout the world in organized cooperation and\r\nfraternal helpfulness,\" and a constitution was adopted. The roll of\r\nnations was called and the delegates from Great Britain, Germany,\r\nNetherlands, Sweden and the United States pledged affiliation. Mrs.\r\nCatt made the pledge for Australia. Delegates from Denmark and Norway\r\nasked for time to present the matter to their associations and a\r\nlittle later became auxiliaries. All the suffrage associations in\r\nexistence that could be called national except that of Canada--eight\r\naltogether--joined the Alliance. Mesdames Minna Cauer, Germany; Agda\r\nMontelius, Sweden; Charlotte Norrie, Denmark; Mrs. Blankenburg, Dr.\r\nJacobs and Miss Palliser were appointed to consider designs for an\r\ninternational badge.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony announced that as she had reached the age of 84 she could\r\nnot stand as candidate for the presidency and it was unanimously voted\r\nthat she be made honorary president. The following officers were\r\nelected: President, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, New York; first\r\nvice-president, Dr. jur. Anita Augspurg, Hamburg; second\r\nvice-president, Mrs. Millicent Garrett Fawcett, London; secretary,\r\nMrs. Rachel Foster Avery, Philadelphia; first assistant secretary, Dr.\r\nKäthe Schirmacher, Paris (address temporarily); second, Miss Johanna\r\nA. W. Naber, Amsterdam; treasurer, Miss Rodger Cunliffe, London.\r\n(Later Miss Naber resigned and Miss Martina G. Kramers of Rotterdam\r\nwas appointed.)\r\n\r\nThe Executive Committee of the new Alliance met June 6 at the Palast\r\nHotel. It was arranged that fifty copies of the Declaration of\r\nPrinciples, the Constitution and the Minutes be typed in Berlin and\r\nsent to the presidents of the affiliated societies and the honorary\r\nassociates. It was decided to postpone application for auxiliaryship\r\nto the International Council of Women for at least two years.\r\nCorrespondence with the countries requiring special information was\r\nassigned as follows: \"To Mrs. Catt, Australia; to Dr. Augspurg, Norway\r\nand Austria; to Dr. Schirmacher, Italy and France; to Miss Naber,\r\nSwitzerland and Belgium. It was decided that the Alliance should meet\r\nevery five years for the election of officers, revision of the\r\nconstitution, etc., but that during this period executive meetings\r\nand congresses might be held.[222]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD CONFERENCE OF THE ALLIANCE.\r\n\r\nThe first Executive Meeting and Third Conference of the Alliance was\r\nheld at Copenhagen Aug. 7-11, 1906, in the Concert Palais, in response\r\nto a Call from the president, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, and secretary,\r\nMrs. Rachel Foster Avery, to the affiliated National Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociations, which said:\r\n\r\n     An especial invitation to send fraternal delegates is extended to\r\n     all societies known to be in sympathy with our movement.\r\n     Individuals of whatever race, nativity or creed, who believe in\r\n     the right of the woman citizen to protect her interests in\r\n     society by the ballot, are invited to be present. The\r\n     enfranchisement of women is emphatically a world movement. The\r\n     unanswerable logic upon which the movement is based and the\r\n     opposition which everywhere appears to combat that logic with its\r\n     array of traditions and prejudices are the same in all lands. The\r\n     evolution of the movement must proceed along the same lines among\r\n     all peoples. In union there is strength. Let international\r\n     cooperation, organization and work be our watchwords.\r\n\r\nTwo years of careful preparation, extended correspondence and close\r\nattention to endless details by the president and officers of the\r\nAlliance had brought to Copenhagen a congress of women prepared to\r\ninaugurate a world movement for woman suffrage. Excellent arrangements\r\nhad been made by the Danish Association through four committees:\r\nFinance, Miss Eline Hansen; Information, Miss Julie Laurberg; Press,\r\nMiss Sophie Alberti; Entertainment, Mrs. Johanne Münter. The music was\r\nin charge of Miss Bernberg. The entire expenses of the convention,\r\nrent of hall, handsome decorations, silk badges, etc., were met by the\r\nfinance committee. The elaborate souvenir programs contained many\r\nviews of the city which were made by Miss Laurberg's camera. The\r\nremarkable work of the press before and during the congress was due to\r\nMiss Alberti's judicious and skilful management. The entertainments\r\nunder the capable direction of Mrs. Münter included a beautiful dinner\r\ngiven by a committee of Danish ladies at the famous pleasure resort\r\nMarienlyst; a reception by the directors at Rosenberg Castle; an\r\nafternoon tea by the officers of the widely-known Women's Reading Club\r\nof 3,200 members, of which Miss Alberti, a founder, was the president;\r\na reception and banquet by the Municipal Council in the magnificent\r\nCity Hall and a farewell supper by the Danish Suffrage Association at\r\nSkydebanen, preceded by an interesting program of recitations and\r\ncostume dances. There were many private dinners, luncheons and\r\nexcursions to the beautiful and historic environs.\r\n\r\nTwo more national suffrage associations had united with the\r\nAlliance--those of Hungary and Canada. Australia was ready to enter.\r\nFrance had sent a delegate, Madame Maria Martin, and expected to form\r\na national association within a year. Professor Teresa Labriola was\r\npresent to promise the affiliation of Italy in another year. Six\r\nhighly educated, progressive delegates from Russia represented the\r\nUnion of Defenders of Woman's Rights, composed of 79 societies and\r\n10,000 members, which applied for auxiliaryship. Fraternal delegates\r\nwere present from the International Council of Women and the National\r\nCouncils of Norway, Sweden, France, the United States and Australia;\r\nfrom the International Council of Nurses and from organizations of\r\nwomen in Finland and Iceland. Telegrams of greeting were received from\r\nsocieties and individuals in twenty-five different cities of Europe.\r\nAbout one hundred delegates and alternates from twelve countries were\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nSeveral sessions were filled to overflowing with these greetings and\r\nthe reports from the various countries of the progress made by women\r\nin the contest for their civil, legal and political rights. As\r\npublished in the Minutes, filling 55 pages, these reports formed a\r\nremarkable and significant chapter in the world's history. Mrs. Catt\r\nwas in the chair on the first afternoon and a cordial welcome was\r\nextended by the presidents of five Danish organizations of women: Miss\r\nAlberti, Mrs. Louise Hansen, Mrs. Louise Norlund, Mrs. Jutta Bojsen\r\nMoller and Miss Henni Forchhammer for the National Council of Women.\r\nDr. jur. Anita Augspurg of Germany, the first vice-president,\r\nresponded for the Alliance. She was followed by Mrs. Catt, who, in her\r\npresident's address, after describing in full the forming of the\r\nAlliance, gave a comprehensive report of the progress toward\r\norganizing suffrage associations in the various countries during the\r\npast two years and the growth and future prospects of the\r\ninternational movement. She touched a responsive chord in every heart\r\nwhen she said:\r\n\r\n     Since we last met our cause has sustained a signal loss in the\r\n     death of our honorary president, Susan B. Anthony. She has been\r\n     the inspirer of our movement in many lands and we may justly say\r\n     that her labors belonged to all the world. She passed in the\r\n     ripeness of years and with a life behind her which counted not a\r\n     wasted moment nor a selfish thought. When one thinks of her it\r\n     must be with the belief that she was born and lived to perform an\r\n     especial mission. All who knew her well mourn her and long will\r\n     they miss her wise counsel, her hearty cheerfulness and her\r\n     splendid optimism. There has been no important national suffrage\r\n     meeting in the United States for half a century and no\r\n     international meeting of significance at any time in which she\r\n     has not been a conspicuous figure. This is the first to meet\r\n     without her. We must hope that her spirit will be with us and\r\n     inspire our deliberations with the same lofty purpose and noble\r\n     energy which governed all her labors.\r\n\r\nMrs. Catt reviewed the movement for woman suffrage, declaring that the\r\nmost ambitious should be satisfied with the general progress, and said\r\nin conclusion:\r\n\r\n     We have been like an army climbing slowly and laboriously up a\r\n     steep and rocky mountain. We have looked upward and have seen\r\n     uncertain stretches of time and effort between us and the longed\r\n     for summit. We have not been discouraged for behind us lay fifty\r\n     years of marvelous achievement. We have known that we should\r\n     reach that goal but we have also known that there was no way to\r\n     do it but to plod on patiently, step by step. Yet suddenly,\r\n     almost without warning, we see upon that summit another army. How\r\n     came it there? It has neither descended from heaven nor made the\r\n     long, hard journey, yet there above us all the women of Finland\r\n     stand today. Each wears the royal crown of the sovereignty of the\r\n     self-governing citizen. Two years ago these women would not have\r\n     been permitted by the law to organize a woman suffrage\r\n     association. A year later they did organize a woman suffrage\r\n     committee and before it is yet a year old its work is done! The\r\n     act giving full suffrage and eligibility to all offices has been\r\n     bestowed upon them by the four Chambers of Parliament and the\r\n     Czar has approved the measure! Metaphorically a glad shout of joy\r\n     has gone up from the whole body of suffragists the world over.\r\n\r\nMrs. Catt presided at every public and every business meeting and hers\r\nwas the guiding spirit and the controlling hand. By her ability and\r\nfairness she won the entire confidence of the delegates from twelve\r\ncountries and launched successfully this organization which many had\r\nbelieved impossible because of the differences in language,\r\ntemperament and methods.\r\n\r\nThroughout the meetings twenty-minute addresses were made by prominent\r\nwomen of the different countries, some of them reports of the\r\norganized work, others on subjects of special interest to women, among\r\nthem The Ideal Woman, Miss Eline Hansen; What Woman Suffrage Is Not,\r\nDr. Schirmacher; Women Jurors of Norway, Miss Mörck; Woman's Horizon,\r\nMrs. Flora MacDonald Denison, Canada; The Silent Foe, Dr. Anna Howard\r\nShaw; What Are Women to Do?, Dr. Jacobs; Our Victory, Miss Annie\r\nFuruhjelm, Finland; Why the Working Woman Needs the Ballot, Mrs.\r\nAndrea Brachmann, Denmark; Why the Women of Australia Asked for and\r\nReceived the Suffrage, sent by Miss Vida Goldstein and read by Mrs.\r\nMadge Donohoe.\r\n\r\nOthers besides the officers and those above mentioned who spoke during\r\nthe convention were Cand. phil. Helena Berg, Elizabeth Grundtvig,\r\nStampe Fedderson, Denmark: Briet Asmundsson, Iceland; Mrs. F. M. Qvam,\r\nCand. phil. Mathilde Eriksen, Gina Krog and Mrs. L. Keilhau, Norway;\r\nDr. Ellen Sandelin, Anna Whitlock, Gertrud Adelborg, Huldah Lundin,\r\nAnn Margret Holmgren, Frigga Carlberg, Anna B. Wicksell, and Jenny\r\nWallerstedt, Sweden; Baroness Gripenberg, Dr. Meikki Friberg, Finland;\r\nZeniede Mirovitch, Elizabeth Goncharow, Olga Wolkenstein, Anne\r\nKalmanovitch, Russia; Rosika Schwimmer, Vilma Glücklich, Bertha Engel,\r\nHungary; Lida Gustave Heymann, Adelheid von Welczeck, Regina Ruben,\r\nGermany; Mrs. Rutgers Hoitsema, Mrs. van Loenen de Bordes,\r\nNetherlands; Millicent Garrett Fawcett, Lady Steel, Dora Montefiore,\r\nMrs. Broadley Reid, Great Britain; Miss Lucy E. Anthony, United\r\nStates; Mrs. Henry Dobson, Australia.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon session was devoted to memorial services for Miss\r\nAnthony, with the principal address by Mrs. Ida Husted Harper, her\r\nbiographer, and beautiful tributes by delegates of seven European\r\ncountries and Canada expressing the debt of gratitude which all women\r\nowed to the great pioneer. Mrs. Harper briefly sketched the\r\nsubordinate position of women when Miss Anthony began her great work\r\nfor their emancipation in 1851; told of her efforts for temperance and\r\nthe abolition of slavery; her part in forming the International\r\nCouncil of Women; her publication of the History of Woman Suffrage and\r\nthe many other activities of her long life. She described the advanced\r\nposition of women at present and closed by saying:\r\n\r\n     No one who makes a careful study of the great movement for the\r\n     emancipation of woman can fail to recognize in Miss Anthony its\r\n     supreme leader. After her death last March more than a thousand\r\n     editorials appeared in the principal newspapers of the country\r\n     and practically every one of them accorded her this distinction.\r\n     She was the only one who gave to this cause her whole life,\r\n     consecrating to its service every hour of her time and every\r\n     power of her being. Other women did what they could; came into\r\n     the work for awhile and dropped out; had the divided interests of\r\n     family and social relations; turned their attention to reforms\r\n     which promised speedier rewards; surrendered to the forces of\r\n     persecution. With Miss Anthony the cause of woman took the place\r\n     of husband, children, society; it was her work and her\r\n     relaxation, her politics and her religion. \"I know only woman and\r\n     her disfranchised,\" was her creed.... May we, her daughters,\r\n     receive as a blessed inheritance something of her indomitable\r\n     will, splendid courage, limitless patience, perseverance,\r\n     optimism, faith!\r\n\r\nDr. Shaw closed the meeting with an eloquent unwritten peroration\r\nwhich told of her last hours with Miss Anthony as the great soul was\r\nabout to take its flight and ended: \"The object of her life was to\r\nawaken in women the consciousness of the need of freedom and the\r\ncourage to demand it, not as an end but as a means of creating higher\r\nideals for humanity.\"\r\n\r\nA resolution was adopted rejoicing in the granting of full suffrage\r\nand eligibility to sit in the Parliament to the women of Finland the\r\npreceding May. The delegates from Norway received a message from the\r\nPrime Minister that it was the intention of the Parliament to enlarge\r\nthe Municipal franchise which women had possessed since 1901.\r\n\r\nDesigns for a permanent badge were submitted by several countries and\r\nthe majority vote was in favor of the one designed by Mrs.\r\nPedersen-Dan of Denmark, the figure of a woman holding the scales of\r\njustice with a rising sun in the background and the Latin words Jus\r\nSuffragii. It was decided to publish a monthly paper under the name of\r\n_Jus Suffragii_ and in the English language. Afterwards Miss Martina\r\nG. Kramers was appointed editor and the paper was issued from\r\nRotterdam. The invitation was accepted to hold an executive meeting\r\nand conference in Amsterdam in 1908, as a new constitution was about\r\nto be made for The Netherlands and there would be a strong effort to\r\nhave it include woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nMrs. Catt's closing words to the delegates were to encourage\r\nagitation, education and organization in their countries. \"The\r\nenfranchisement of women is as certain to come as the sun is sure to\r\nrise tomorrow,\" she said. \"The time must depend on political\r\nconditions and the energy and intelligence with which our movement is\r\nconducted.\" Thus ended happily and auspiciously the first Congress of\r\nthe International Woman Suffrage Alliance.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH CONFERENCE OF THE ALLIANCE.\r\n\r\nThe Executive Meeting and Fourth Conference of the International Woman\r\nSuffrage Alliance was held in Amsterdam, June 15-20, 1908, in the\r\nspacious and handsome Concert Hall, in response to the Call of Mrs.\r\nCarrie Chapman Catt, president, and Mrs. Rachel Foster Avery,\r\nsecretary. No one who was present can ever forget this meeting in the\r\nmost fascinating of countries, with every detail of its six days'\r\nsessions carefully planned and nothing left undone for the comfort and\r\nentertainment of the visitors who had come from most of the countries\r\nof Europe, from Canada, the United States and far-away Australia and\r\nNew Zealand. The following account is condensed from the very full\r\nreport of the recording secretary, Miss Martina G. Kramers:\r\n\r\nThe arrangements for the congress were made by a Central Committee, of\r\nwhich Dr. Aletta Jacobs, president of the Vereeniging voor\r\nVrouwenkiesrecht, the organization which had invited the Alliance to\r\nAmsterdam, was chairman. Mrs. W. Drucker was chairman of the Finance\r\nCommittee, Mrs. Van Buuren Huys, secretary, and Miss Rosa Manus gave\r\nmuch assistance. The Press Committee, Miss Johanna W. A. Naber,\r\nchairman, did excellent work in conjunction with a committee from the\r\nAmsterdam press association.... That the accounts throughout the world\r\nwere so complete is due to this painstaking, able committee's\r\nassistance to the correspondents from far and wide.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Local Arrangements, Mrs. van Loenen de Bordes,\r\nchairman, performed well many duties, issued a dainty booklet, bound\r\nin green and gold, which contained the program interspersed with views\r\nof Amsterdam, and provided handsome silk flags to mark the seats of\r\neach delegation, which were presented to the Alliance. A Bureau of\r\nInformation was presided over by young women who were able to answer\r\nall questions in many languages. The back of the great stage was\r\ndraped with the flags of the twenty nations represented, those of\r\nNorway, Finland and Australia being conspicuously placed in the\r\ncenter, that especial honor might be done the full suffrage countries.\r\nThe front of the stage was a mass of flowers and plants, a magnificent\r\nbust of Queen Wilhelmina occupying a conspicuous place.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Reception, chairman, Mrs. Gompertz Jitta, and that on\r\nEntertainments, chairman, Mrs. Schöffer-Bunge, provided many\r\npleasures. Chief among these was the musical reception on the first\r\nafternoon. A grand welcome song with a military band playing the\r\naccompaniment was sung by four hundred voices; a variety of children's\r\nsongs followed and the program was closed by a cantata called Old\r\nHolland's New Time, which had been prepared especially for the\r\ncongress. All the music had been composed by Catherine Van Rennes, who\r\nwas also the conductor. The congress opened with a large reception\r\ngiven by the Dutch Women's Suffrage Association at Maison Couturier,\r\nwith a greeting by Mrs. Gompertz-Jitta. It had as a unique feature a\r\nlittle play written by Betsy van der Starp of The Hague. The gods and\r\ngoddesses with much feeling discussed the appeal of Woman, who had\r\nasked their help in her effort to secure more rights on Earth.... On\r\nTuesday afternoon a reception was given by Burgomaster and Mrs. van\r\nLeeuwen at their beautiful home, where refreshments were served in a\r\nshaded garden and the hospitable and democratic freedom was greatly\r\nenjoyed. On the same afternoon the Amsterdam branch of the National\r\nAssociation took the foreign visitors for a delightful excursion on\r\nthe Amstel River. On Wednesday afternoon Dr. Jacobs had a most\r\nenjoyable tea in the Pavilloen van het Vondelpark. Mrs. Gompertz-Jitta\r\nopened her own luxurious home for tea on Friday. A house filled with a\r\nrare art collection, a fine garden and a charming hostess gave an\r\nafternoon long to be remembered. A farewell dinner on Saturday night\r\nwas held in the great Concert Hall. A gay assembly, a good dinner, the\r\nnational airs of all countries played by a fine band, furnished\r\nabundant enjoyment and aroused enthusiasm to the utmost. The climax\r\ncame when a band of young men and women, dressed in the quaint and\r\npicturesque costumes of the Dutch peasantry, to rollicking music\r\nexecuted several peasant dances on the platform and around the big\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThe day following at an early hour several car loads of suffragists\r\nset forth for Rotterdam and near the station two steamers took their\r\ncargo of happy people for a trip on the River Maas. They went as far\r\nas Dordrecht, where opportunity was given to see this quaint town.\r\nLuncheon had been served on the steamers and at Rotterdam the guests\r\nproceeded to the Zoological Garden, which many people pronounce the\r\nfinest in the world. At 6:30 dinner was served in a large, fine\r\nrestaurant, followed by animated speeches until train time. It had\r\nbeen a rare day, full of interest, for which the Congress was indebted\r\nto the Rotterdam branch of the National Association and to Mrs. van\r\nden Bergh-Willing, who supplied one of the steamers and invited over a\r\nhundred of the delegates as her guests for the day. The next day was\r\nspent under the direction of The Hague branch. An afternoon tea with\r\nmusic was given at the Palace Hotel, Scheveningen, the famous seaside\r\nresort, and later a dinner was served at the Kurhaus, followed by a\r\nfine concert arranged in honor of the guests. Later came a special\r\ndisplay of fireworks with a closing piece which triumphantly flashed\r\nthe words \"Jus Suffragii\" across the sky.\r\n\r\nMrs. Catt was in the chair at the first afternoon session and Dr.\r\nJacobs welcomed the conference in an address given in perfect English\r\nduring which she said: \"When so strong and energetic a body of earnest\r\nwomen meets to deliberate on this greatest of modern world problems\r\nthe impression can not fail to be a powerful one, for the vision must\r\narise of the beauty and glory of future womanhood, of women who have\r\nobtained proper place and power in the community, which shall enable\r\nthem to infuse their love, their moral perceptions, their sense of\r\njustice into the governments of the world. We believe the moment has\r\nnow come to show our country the seriousness and extent of our\r\nmovement and its determination to gain political equality for women in\r\nevery civilized land. With the greatest appreciation we see among our\r\nvisitors many high officials, who have not hesitated to answer our\r\ninvitation favorably and to give us through their presence a proof of\r\nsympathy with the work we do. We wish to welcome these gentlemen first\r\nof all.\" Naming one country after another Dr. Jacobs mentioned the\r\nparticular achievement of each during the past two years and extended\r\na special welcome, saying: \"May your presence here contribute to\r\naugment the public interest in the movement for women's\r\nenfranchisement in our country.\"\r\n\r\nThe address of the international president, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,\r\nwas a masterly effort and should be reproduced in full. In beginning\r\nit she referred to the suggestive coincidence that the opening day of\r\nthe Congress commemorated the anniversary of the signing of the\r\nimmortal Magna Charta and said: \"At no time since the movement for the\r\nenfranchisement of women began have its advocates had so much cause\r\nfor self-congratulation as now. The Alliance met in Copenhagen\r\ntwenty-two months ago and in the brief time since then the progress of\r\nour cause has been so rapid, the gains so substantial, the assurance\r\nof coming victory so certain that we may imagine the noble and brave\r\npioneers of woman suffrage, the men and women who were the\r\ntorch-bearers of our movement, gathering today in some far-off\r\ncelestial sphere and singing together a glad pæan of exultation.\" Mrs.\r\nCatt referred to the granting of full suffrage and eligibility to\r\nwomen by Norway in 1907 and continued:\r\n\r\n     Within the past two years appeals for woman suffrage have been\r\n     presented to the Parliaments of eighteen European governments;\r\n     the United States Congress and the Legislatures of twenty-nine\r\n     States; the Parliaments of Canada and Victoria and the\r\n     Legislature of the Philippines--fifty-one independent legislative\r\n     bodies. The appeals were made for the first time, I believe, in\r\n     twelve of the European countries. In Spain and the Philippines\r\n     bills were introduced by friends of the cause quite unknown to\r\n     national or international officers. This activity has not been\r\n     barren of results and the delegates of six countries come to this\r\n     congress vested with larger political rights than they possessed\r\n     at the time of the Copenhagen meeting, namely, Norway, Denmark,\r\n     Sweden, Iceland, England and Germany. Each of the five\r\n     Scandinavian lands has won something. Norwegian women come with\r\n     full suffrage rights; Finnish delegates come as representatives\r\n     of the only nation which has elected women to seats in its\r\n     Parliament; Sweden and Iceland have gained a step in eligibility\r\n     and our Icelandic delegate of two years ago is now a member of\r\n     the city council of Reykjavik, the capital. The women of Denmark,\r\n     next to those of Norway, have made the largest gain, as Municipal\r\n     suffrage with liberal qualifications has been bestowed upon them.\r\n     English women have secured eligibility to become Mayors and\r\n     members of town and county councils. Germany has revised its law\r\n     and women are now free to join political associations and to\r\n     organize woman suffrage societies. The German association\r\n     affiliated with the Alliance is now a federation of State bodies.\r\n     In Sweden within two years the membership in the organization has\r\n     doubled and the 63 local organizations reported at Copenhagen\r\n     have become 127. A petition of 142,128 names has been presented\r\n     to Parliament; deputations have waited upon the Government and\r\n     been granted hearings.\r\n\r\nA thorough analysis was made of the present status of woman suffrage\r\nthroughout the world and in summing up the speaker said: \"Although\r\nfrom Occident to Orient, from Lapland to sunny Italy and from Canada\r\nto South Africa the agitation for woman suffrage has known no pause,\r\nyet, after all, the storm center of the movement has been located in\r\nEngland. In other lands there have been steps in evolution; in England\r\nthere has been a revolution. There have been no guns nor powder nor\r\nbloodshed but there have been all other evidences of war.... Yet the\r\nolder and more conservative body of workers have been no less\r\nremarkable. With a forbearance we may all do well to imitate, they\r\nquadrupled their own activities. Every class, including ladies of the\r\nnobility, working girls, housewives and professional women, has\r\nengaged in the campaign and not a man, woman or child has been\r\npermitted to plead ignorance concerning the meaning of woman\r\nsuffrage.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Catt reviewed at length the \"militant\" movement in Great Britain,\r\nshowing how it had awakened interest in votes for women in all\r\nquarters of the globe, and recalled the struggle of the barons in\r\nwresting the Magna Charta from King John. She then passed to the\r\nUnited States and to the persistent charge that its experiment in\r\nuniversal male suffrage had been a failure, to which she replied:\r\n\"Although the United States has gathered a population which represents\r\nevery race; although among its people are the followers of every\r\nreligion and the subjects of every form of government; although there\r\nhas been the dead weight of a large ignorant vote, yet the little\r\nsettlement, which 150 years ago rested upon the eastern shores of the\r\nAtlantic a mere colonial possession, has steadily climbed upward until\r\ntoday it occupies a proud position of equality among the greatest\r\ngovernments of the world.... The fact that woman suffrage must come\r\nthrough a referendum to the votes of all men has postponed it but man\r\nsuffrage in the United States is as firmly fixed as the Rock of\r\nGibraltar....\"\r\n\r\nIn an eloquent peroration Mrs. Catt said: \"Within our Alliance we must\r\ntry to develop so lofty a spirit of internationalism, a spirit so\r\nclarified from all personalities and ambitions and national\r\nantagonisms that its purity and grandeur will furnish new inspiration\r\nto all workers in our cause. We must strike a note in this meeting so\r\nfull of sisterly sympathy, of faith in womanhood, of exultant hope, a\r\nnote so impelling, that it will be heard by the women of all lands and\r\nwill call them forth to join our world's army.\"\r\n\r\nThe business sessions opened with all the officers present; over one\r\nhundred delegates and alternates from the now sixteen auxiliary\r\ncountries; delegates sent by their governments and fraternal delegates\r\nfrom the International Council of Women, ten National Councils, seven\r\nnon-affiliated national associations for woman suffrage and eleven\r\nnational organizations in sympathy with it. Mrs. Catt introduced Mrs.\r\nHenry Dobson, sent by the Commonwealth of Australia; Miss Gina Krog,\r\nsent by the government of Norway; Dr. Romania Penrose, Mrs. Helen L.\r\nGrenfell and Mrs. Harriet Q. Sheik, appointed by the Governors of\r\nUtah, Colorado and Wyoming, U. S. A.\r\n\r\nThe following countries had their full quota of six delegates:\r\nDenmark, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden,\r\nUnited States, and nearly all had six alternates. Russia had five\r\ndelegates; Finland, Switzerland and South Africa two each; Italy,\r\nBulgaria, Australia and Canada one each. Miss Chrystal Macmillan of\r\nScotland represented the International Council of Women; Dr. C. V.\r\nDrysdale, the Men's League for Women's Enfranchisement of Great\r\nBritain; Mrs. Marie Lang, the Austrian Committee for Woman Suffrage;\r\nMiss Franciska Plaminkova and Miss Marie Stepankova, the Czechish\r\nWoman Suffrage Committee of Bohemia; Mrs. Alice M. Steele, New\r\nZealand--the last three countries not yet affiliated. All kinds of\r\norganizations sent fraternal delegates, from the Union of Ethical\r\nSocieties in London, whose delegate was Stanton Coit, their leader, to\r\nthe Society of Peasant Women in Balmazujvaros, Hungary.\r\n\r\nThis was doubtless in many respects the most remarkable and important\r\ngathering of women ever assembled up to that time. English, French and\r\nGerman were adopted as the official languages. The wise and\r\nsympathetic management of Mrs. Catt convinced those of all nations\r\nthat impartiality and justice would prevail without exception; a\r\ncommon bond united them; they learned that in all countries the\r\nobstacles to woman suffrage were the same and that in all women\r\nwere oppressed by the inequality of the laws and by their\r\ndisenfranchisement, and they understood the influence which could be\r\nexerted through an international movement. There were occasional\r\nmisunderstandings on account of the varied parliamentary procedure in\r\ndifferent countries and because of the necessity for interpreting much\r\nthat took place but on the whole the delegates were satisfied. They\r\nhad intense admiration for the great executive ability of their\r\npresident and showed their confidence in her again and again.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland, Bulgaria and South Africa having announced through their\r\ndelegates that their suffrage societies had united in national\r\nassociations and desired to become affiliated, they were\r\nenthusiastically accepted. Mrs. Stanton Coit of London, the new\r\ntreasurer, paid a tribute to her predecessor, Miss Rodger Cunliffe,\r\nwho had died since the last conference. Mrs. Pedersen-Dan reported\r\nthat 8,677 badges had been sold. Many interesting discussions took\r\nplace during the morning and afternoon sessions of which one of the\r\nmost valuable was on the methods of work for the suffrage pursued in\r\nthe various countries. These methods included debates in schools and\r\ncolleges, distribution of literature, petitions to the Parliament,\r\ncirculating libraries, courses of lectures, house-to-house canvassing,\r\nprotests against paying taxes, mass meetings to show the need of a\r\nvote in matters of public welfare. In nearly all countries the\r\nsuffragists were taking political action, questioning candidates by\r\nletter and in person and in some places working for or against them.\r\nThis was especially the case in Great Britain and Miss Frances\r\nSterling and Miss Isabella O. Ford told of the successful work at\r\nby-elections, of having thousands of postal cards sent to candidates\r\nby their constituents, of appealing to the workingmen. A report of the\r\nspeech of Miss Margaret Ashton, a member of the city council of\r\nManchester, quoted her as saying that, though the president of a large\r\nbody of Liberal women, she had decided that it was useless to work\r\nfurther for her party unless it would enfranchise women. Women had\r\nworked sixty years for this party and now, if they will gain their own\r\nliberty, they must refuse to lift hand or foot for it until it\r\nenfranchises them.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rutgers Hoitsema of the Netherlands told of the efforts made to\r\nhave woman suffrage put in its new constitution; of winning six of the\r\nseven members of the Government Commission and of the request of the\r\nPrime Minister for favorable printed arguments. Miss Annie Furuhjelm\r\nsaid in her report for Finland: \"We got our suffrage through a\r\nrevolution, so we can not be an example for other lands as to methods.\r\nWe can say, however, that we used all methods in our work. In 1904 we\r\nhad a great public meeting for woman suffrage. We organized a 'strike'\r\nagainst the conscription for the Russian Army and we found the mothers\r\ninterested in saving their sons. The Social Democrats had woman\r\nsuffrage in their platform before 1905 but the leading men of Finland\r\nwould not have helped the women to the suffrage if the women had not\r\nshown that they understood the public questions of the day and taken\r\nan active part in resistance to an unlawful régime.\" She told of the\r\nelection of nineteen women to Parliament in 1907. Mrs. Zeneide\r\nMirovitch said in her touching report: \"The women of Russia have not\r\nbeen able to work as those in other countries do, for their members\r\nare often in danger of imprisonment or death. They have lecturers who\r\ntravel about to hold meetings; they publish a review of the work of\r\ntheir Union; members of it have started clubs which carry on general\r\nwork for women's betterment. They have sold very cheaply 10,000\r\nsuffrage pamphlets; they have a committee in St. Petersburg which\r\nwatches the acts of the Douma and when a law is proposed which\r\nconcerns women and yet fails to consider them, this committee reminds\r\nthe members of their needs. It protests against the massacres and\r\noutrages when women are assaulted and tortured. Now during the\r\nreaction the Union is not permitted to work in any way.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Dora Montefiore of England spoke in favor of \"militant\" methods.\r\nAn invitation to send fraternal delegates had been declined by Mrs.\r\nEmmeline Pankhurst for the Women's Social and Political Union of Great\r\nBritain, who said they had more important work to do. It had been\r\naccepted by Mrs. Despard, president of the Womens' Freedom League, who\r\ncame with seven delegates. She explained that its methods consisted\r\nonly of trying to enter the House of Commons, holding meetings near\r\nby, heckling Government candidates, refusing to pay taxes, chalking\r\npavements, etc. Mrs. Cobden Sanderson and Mrs. Billington Greig made\r\nvigorous, convincing speeches and all were enthusiastically received.\r\nThe congress adopted a resolution of \"protest against the action of\r\nany government which classes the women suffragists imprisoned for\r\nagitation for the vote as common law-breakers instead of political\r\noffenders.\" It also expressed its \"sympathy for the Russian women in\r\ntheir struggle demanding so much sacrifice and its profound respect\r\nfor the women who under great trial do not hesitate to stand for their\r\nrights.\" A message was received with applause during one session that\r\n\"the Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church has resolved unanimously\r\nto give a vote to women on the questions that have until now been\r\nsubmitted only to the men of the congregation.\"\r\n\r\nThe evening meetings were largely given up to addresses and at the one\r\nwhere Woman Suffrage in Practice was considered Mrs. Madge Donohue of\r\nAustralia, spoke on An Experiment Justified; Mrs. Steele, New Zealand,\r\nFifteen Years of Woman Suffrage; Miss Furuhjelm, A True Democracy. At\r\nanother evening session Miss Fredrikke Mörck gave the Results of Woman\r\nSuffrage in Norway. In a symposium, Why Should Representative\r\nGovernments Enfranchise Women? the speakers were Miss Ashton, Mrs.\r\nMinna Cauer, Germany; Miss Janka Grossman, Hungary; Mrs. Theo. Haver,\r\nNetherlands; Mrs. Louise Keilhau, Norway; Mrs. Frigga Carlberg,\r\nSweden; Mrs. Olga Golovine, Russia; Mrs. A. Girardet, Switzerland;\r\nMiss Macmillan, Great Britain. Here as at nearly all of the public\r\nmeetings Dr. Anna Howard Shaw made the closing speech, for if she was\r\nnot on the program the audience called for her. Mrs. Münter gave an\r\naddress on the Legal Position of Danish Women; Dr. Elizabeth Altmann\r\nGottheiner, Germany, Does the Working Woman Need the Ballot? Mrs.\r\nMiriam Brown, Canada, Ideal Womanhood; others were made by Miss Rosika\r\nSchwimmer, Hungary, and Miss Stirling, Great Britain. An afternoon\r\nmeeting for young people was addressed by Mrs. Millicent Garrett\r\nFawcett, chairman; Mrs. Ann M. Holmgren, Sweden; Dr. Anita Augspurg,\r\nMrs. Mirovitch; Miss Rendell, Great Britain; Miss Schwimmer; Mrs. Ella\r\nS. Stewart, United States.\r\n\r\nMuch pleasure was expressed at the report of Mrs. Staatsministerinde\r\nQvam, president of the National Woman Suffrage Association of Norway,\r\nwho said in beginning: \"Since we met in Copenhagen taxpaying women in\r\nNorway have obtained full suffrage and eligibility to office by a vote\r\nof 96 to 23 in the Parliament. About 300,000 women have become\r\nentitled to vote. It is calculated that 200,000 are yet excluded,\r\nalthough the tax is very small.... The object of our association is\r\nsuffrage for women on the same terms as for men. The men have\r\nuniversal suffrage. We therefore will continue our work until the\r\nwomen have gained this same right.\" Miss Eline Hansen gave an\r\ninteresting report of winning the Municipal franchise in Denmark.\r\n\r\nWoman Suffrage from a Christian Point of View was presented one\r\nafternoon by Mrs. Beelaerts von Blokland, chairman; Countess Anna von\r\nHogendorp and Mr. Hugenholtz, all of the Netherlands; Mrs.\r\nBlauenfeldt, Denmark; Mrs. Catharine Waugh McCulloch, United States.\r\nAn address sent by Lady Frances Balfour was read by Mrs. C. H.\r\nCorbett, Great Britain; one sent by Mrs. Aline Hoffmann, Switzerland,\r\nwas read by Miss Johanna W. A. Naber, Netherlands; one sent by Mme.\r\nMangeret, France, was read by Mrs. Heineken-Daum, Netherlands.\r\nGreetings were given from the National Councils of Women of Germany\r\nand The Netherlands by their presidents, Mrs. Marie Stritt and Miss\r\nElizabeth Baelde; from Great Britain, France, Belgium, Norway and\r\nSweden by fraternal delegates, Mrs. Fawcett, Miss Cecile Cahen, Miss\r\nIda La Fontaine, Miss Thea Holst, Dr. Lydia Wahlstrom; from national\r\norganizations by Mrs. Elna Munck, Denmark; Dr. Phil. Käthe\r\nSchirmacher, Germany; Miss Stepankova, Bohemia; Mrs. Lang, Austria;\r\nMiss K. Honegger represented the newly affiliated national association\r\nof Switzerland and Dr. Pateff and Miss Jenny Bojilowa that of\r\nBulgaria. Most valuable reports were read from all the affiliated\r\ncountries containing accounts of their political conditions and the\r\nstatus of the movement for woman suffrage, which were printed in the\r\nMinutes, filling over fifty pages.\r\n\r\nThe Resolutions Committee, Mrs. Ida Husted Harper, Miss Ashton and\r\nMrs. van Loenen de Bores, reported strong resolutions, which were\r\nfully discussed and adopted. The last one was as follows: \"Resolved,\r\nthat the plain duty of women at the present hour is to secure the\r\nsupport and cooperation of all the forces favorable to woman suffrage,\r\nwithout question as to their political or religious affiliations; to\r\navoid any entanglement with outside matters; to ask for the franchise\r\non the same terms as it is now or may be exercised by men, leaving\r\nany required extension to be decided by men and women together when\r\nboth have equal voice, vote and power.\"\r\n\r\nThe conference accepted with appreciation the cordial invitation of\r\nthe National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies of Great Britain,\r\nextended through its president, Mrs. Fawcett, to hold its next meeting\r\nin London. At the public session on the last evening Mrs. van Itallie\r\nvan Embden, Netherlands, spoke on the subject, Does the Wife, Mother\r\nand Homekeeper Need the Ballot? Mrs. Anna Kalmanovitch, Russia, on The\r\nFinal Aim of the Woman Movement;, addresses were made by Mrs. Emilia\r\nMariana, Italy; Mrs. Mirovitch, Dr. Wahlstrom and Dr. Shaw. Mrs. Catt\r\ngave the final words of farewell and the delegates parted in\r\nfriendship to meet again as comrades in a great cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST QUINQUENNIAL OF THE ALLIANCE.\r\n\r\nThe first Quinquennial and the Fifth Conference of the Alliance met in\r\nSt. James Hall, London, April 26-May 1, 1909, with the president, Mrs.\r\nCarrie Chapman Catt, in the chair. A cordial address of greeting was\r\nmade at the first morning session by Mrs. Millicent Garrett Fawcett,\r\npresident of the National Union of Women's suffrage Societies, the\r\nhostess of the guests from many nations. Preceding chapters have given\r\nan idea of the wide scope and the general character of these\r\ninternational meetings and the names of those who earliest represented\r\ntheir countries and their associations. Here at the end of the first\r\nfive years the list of delegates and alternates filled four and a half\r\nprinted pages and seventy-three fraternal delegates were present from\r\nforty-one different organizations; in addition there were speakers on\r\nthe program who were not on these lists.\r\n\r\nAmong the organizations sending fraternal representatives, men and\r\nwomen of distinction, were International and National Councils of\r\nWomen, Actresses', Artists' and Writers' Leagues, Women's Federation\r\nof the British Liberal Party, Conservative and Unionist Women's\r\nFranchise Associations, Men's Suffrage Leagues, Independent Labour\r\nParty, International Women's Socialist Bureau, Ethical Societies,\r\nWomen's Trade Unions, Industrial Suffrage Societies, Women's National\r\nPress Association, Women's Agricultural Clubs, Fabian Society,\r\nNational Committee against the White Slave Traffic--the list is almost\r\nendless. Naturally all wanted to be heard and how to permit this and\r\nleave any time for the regular proceedings of the convention became a\r\nserious question. The United States, Great Britain, Denmark, Germany,\r\nNetherlands, Norway and Sweden sent their full quota of six delegates\r\nand six alternates. Five were present from Finland, six from Hungary\r\nand five from South Africa. The Government of Norway had sent as its\r\nofficial delegate Mrs. Staatsministerinde F. M. Qvam, president of the\r\nNational Woman Suffrage Association. A National Association had now\r\nbeen formed in France and its secretary, Madame Jane Misme, brought\r\nits request for affiliation. A similar request was presented by Mlle.\r\nDaugotte, delegate from a new association in Belgium, and both were\r\nunanimously and joyfully welcomed.\r\n\r\nAt the first evening session the speakers were Mrs. Qvam, Miss Annie\r\nFuruhjelm, Finland; Mrs. Isabel May, New Zealand; Armitage Rigby, Isle\r\nof Man, all testifying to the good effects of woman suffrage in their\r\nrespective countries, and Mrs. Catt delivered her president's address,\r\na thorough review of the work of the Alliance. She said in part:\r\n\r\n     On a June day in 1904 the delegated representatives of seven\r\n     National Woman Suffrage Associations met in a little hall in\r\n     Berlin to discuss the practicability of completing a proposed\r\n     International Union. At that date there were in all the world\r\n     only ten countries in which woman suffrage organizations could be\r\n     found. Those of you who were present will well remember the\r\n     uncertainty and misgivings which characterized our deliberations.\r\n     The doubting delegates questioned whether the times were yet ripe\r\n     for this radical step; already over-taxed by the campaigns in\r\n     their respective countries they questioned whether the possible\r\n     benefits which might arise from international connection might\r\n     not be over-balanced by the burden it would impose. There were\r\n     delegates also who asked whether it was within the bounds of\r\n     possibilities that suffragists could work together in harmony\r\n     when they not only would represent differences of race and\r\n     character but widely different stages of development of the\r\n     movement itself. There were even more serious problems to be\r\n     considered. Some of our associations were pledged to universal\r\n     suffrage, some to Municipal, some to suffrage based upon a\r\n     property or educational qualification. How could such\r\n     differences, each defended as it was by intense conviction, be\r\n     united in a common platform?... Yet despite all these obstacles,\r\n     which at that time seemed to many well nigh insurmountable, our\r\n     International Alliance was founded \"for better or worse\" and I\r\n     think I may add \"till death do us part.\"\r\n\r\n     Five years have passed away, prosperous, successful, triumphant\r\n     years; prosperous, for we have known no quarrel or\r\n     misunderstanding; successful, for the number of National\r\n     Associations in our Alliance has more than doubled; triumphant,\r\n     because the gains to our cause within the past five years are\r\n     more significant in effect and meaning than all which had come in\r\n     the years preceding. Indeed, when we look back over that little\r\n     stretch of time and observe the mighty changes which have come\r\n     within our movement; when we hear the reports of the awakening of\r\n     men and women to the justice of our cause all the way around the\r\n     world, I am sure that there is no pessimist among us who does not\r\n     realize that at last the tide of woman's enfranchisement is\r\n     coming in.\r\n\r\nMrs. Catt described the influence the Alliance had had in these\r\nchanges and said: \"We have been baptised in that spirit of the 20th\r\ncentury which the world calls Internationalism; it is a sentiment like\r\nlove or religion or patriotism, which is to be experienced rather than\r\ndefined in words. Under the influence of this new spirit we realize\r\nthat we are not enlisted for the work of our own countries alone but\r\nthat before us stretches the task of emancipating the women of the\r\ncivilized world....\" The brilliant Congress of Women held in Russia in\r\nspite of its reactionary government was described, and the women of\r\nFinland were urged not to be discouraged because the iron rule of\r\nRussia was again threatening their recently gained liberty. The\r\nprogress in other European countries was sketched and the address then\r\ndealt unsparingly with the situation in Great Britain, where the women\r\nfor years had organized and worked for the candidates of the political\r\nparties, and continued:\r\n\r\n     If the women of England have time enough to solicit votes for the\r\n     men of their party and intelligence enough to train men to vote;\r\n     if they do not neglect their homes and families when their\r\n     political parties direct them to act as catspaws to pull the\r\n     political chestnuts out of the fire and to put them into the\r\n     Conservative and Liberal baskets, the world wants to know how\r\n     these political parties are going to escape from the logic of the\r\n     situation when these same women ask some of the chestnuts for\r\n     themselves. Again, this nation was presided over for sixty years\r\n     by a woman, and she was accounted worthy to present an annual\r\n     Parliamentary Address in which she pointed out the duty of the\r\n     members of Parliament. Now the outside world wants to know how\r\n     that Parliament can consistently say that other British women are\r\n     not even worthy to cast a vote to elect that body. There is still\r\n     another reason why the world is watching England. The British\r\n     Colonies have enfranchised women; how is the Home Government to\r\n     explain the phenomenon of women, enfranchised in Australia, then\r\n     disfranchised in England; enfranchised in New Zealand and\r\n     disfranchised when they return to the mother country?\r\n\r\nShe called attention to the forming of the Anti-Suffrage Association\r\nby women in Great Britain and said: \"They are sending in a petition to\r\nParliament. It is well known that people by nature are opposed to new\r\nthings; before education people are anti-suffragists. If a petition\r\nopposed to woman suffrage should be presented to the Hottentots, the\r\nAfghanistans, the tribes of Thibet or to the interior of Turkey, every\r\nindividual would sign it and the longest petition 'opposed to the\r\nfurther extension of rights to women' yet known could be secured\r\nthere. A petition for suffrage, however, carries a very different\r\nmeaning; every name represents a convert, a victory, an education of\r\nthe understanding, an answer to an appeal for justice. A woman\r\nsuffrage petition is a gain; an anti-suffrage petition merely shows\r\nhow much more must be gained. One is positive, the other negative.\r\nWait a little and you will find that England, and other countries as\r\nwell, will perceive the real truth, that the anti-suffrage women are\r\nthe most inconsistent products of all the ages.\"\r\n\r\nThe flaying did not stop here but Mrs. Catt called attention to the\r\nfact that this convention celebrated the birthday of Mary\r\nWollstonecraft, referred to the position of women in her time and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     There have been women who have crucified their very souls and the\r\n     lineal ancestors of the present-day \"antis\" with withering scorn\r\n     and criticism opposed every step. Yet some of those modern\r\n     anti-suffragists possess a college degree, an opportunity which\r\n     other women won for them in the face of universal ridicule; they\r\n     own property which is theirs today as the effect of laws which\r\n     other women labored for a quarter of a century to secure; they\r\n     stand upon public platforms where free speech for women was won\r\n     for them by other women amid the jeers of howling mobs; they use\r\n     the right of organization which was established as the result of\r\n     many a heartache and many a brave endeavor when the world\r\n     condemned it as a threat against all moral order. They accept\r\n     with satisfaction every political right which has been accorded\r\n     by their Government; they even accept public office. They take\r\n     all as their birthright; and yet, endowed with this power of\r\n     education, of property, of organization, of free speech, of\r\n     partial political rights, they turn upon the last logical effort\r\n     in the movement which has given them so much and with supreme\r\n     self-satisfaction say: \"Thus far shalt thou come and no farther.\"\r\n     It takes no logic to perceive the inconsistency of such a\r\n     position....\r\n\r\nThe changed position of women in the world of labor was sketched; the\r\nold divisions were obliterated; a great army of women were now\r\ncompeting with men in the open market and there were found not only\r\nwomen but little children. Everywhere was cruel injustice to women,\r\nbarred out from the higher places, working for half the pay of men in\r\nothers, and discriminated against even by the labor unions. \"They are\r\nutterly at the mercy of selfish employers, of hard economic conditions\r\nand unfair legislation,\" she said. \"The only logical conclusion is to\r\ngive votes to working women that they may defend their own wages,\r\nhours and conditions. We have worked to gain the suffrage because the\r\nprinciple is just. We must work for it now because this great army of\r\nwage-earning women are crying to us for help, immediate help.... You\r\nand I must know no sleep or rest or hesitation so long as a single\r\ncivilized land has failed to recognize equal rights for men and women,\r\nin the workshop and the factory, at the ballot box and in the\r\nParliament, in the home and in the church.\"\r\n\r\nHere as at all meetings of the Alliance one of the most valuable\r\nfeatures was the reports from the various countries, reaching almost\r\nfrom \"the Arctic Circle to the equator,\" of the progress in the\r\nmovement for suffrage, juster laws for women, better industrial\r\nconditions. Printed in fifty-seven pages of the Minutes they formed a\r\nstorehouse of information nowhere else to be found. As the struggle of\r\nthe \"militants\" in Great Britain was attracting world-wide attention\r\nto the exclusion of the many years of persistent work by the original\r\nassociation in educating not only women themselves but also public\r\nopinion to see the necessity for woman suffrage, the report of its\r\npresident, Mrs. Fawcett, had a special interest:\r\n\r\n     The year which has just closed is the most strenuous and active\r\n     we have ever known since women's suffrage has been before the\r\n     country. The number of societies which combine to form the\r\n     National Union has more than doubled. The membership in several\r\n     societies has more than doubled and in others has largely\r\n     increased; in one important society it has been multiplied by\r\n     five. The number of meetings held throughout the year in\r\n     connection with the National Union alone has been unprecedented,\r\n     an average of at least four a day. The experience gained at\r\n     bye-elections confirms the Union in their view that by far the\r\n     most effective work can be done by acting strictly on non-party\r\n     lines and supporting that candidate whose record and declarations\r\n     on the subject of suffrage are the most satisfactory....\r\n\r\n     At the beginning of last November Mrs. Garrett Anderson, M.D.,\r\n     was elected Mayor of Aldeburgh; Miss Dove, M.A., the head\r\n     mistress of Wycombe Abbey School, came within two votes of being\r\n     chosen Mayor of the borough of High Wycombe. Several women at the\r\n     same time were elected as borough councillors, among whom we may\r\n     mention our colleague, Miss Margaret Ashton, the president of the\r\n     Manchester and North of England Society for Women's Suffrage. A\r\n     large Conservative and Unionist Association for women's suffrage\r\n     has been formed. Its president is Lady Knightley of Fawsley and\r\n     among its vice-presidents are the Duchess of Sutherland, the\r\n     Countess of Meath, Viscountess Middleton, Lady Robert Cecil, Miss\r\n     Alice Balfour, etc.\r\n\r\n     In December a weighty and closely reasoned statement of the case\r\n     for women's suffrage was presented to the Prime Minister by the\r\n     Registered Medical Women of the United Kingdom. The committee\r\n     were able to inform Mr. Asquith that out of 553 all but 15\r\n     support the extension of the Parliamentary franchise to women.\r\n     The case for women's suffrage was argued before the Judicial\r\n     Committee of the House of Lords in November last with great\r\n     ability by Miss Chrystal Macmillan, M.A., B.Sc. The case was\r\n     raised on the plea of women graduates of the Scottish\r\n     Universities that they were entitled to vote in the election for\r\n     the members of Parliament representing the universities. The word\r\n     used in the Scottish University Act was \"persons\"--all \"persons\"\r\n     having passed such and such degrees and fulfilled such and such\r\n     conditions were entitled to vote in such elections. The case had\r\n     been heard before two Scottish Courts and adverse decisions had\r\n     been given. The House of Lords was appealed to as the highest\r\n     Court and it confirmed the decisions of the lower courts that the\r\n     word \"persons\" does not include women when it refers to\r\n     privileges granted by the State.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fawcett spoke of the work of the Union year after year for the\r\nsuffrage bill in Parliament; of the enrollment during the present year\r\nof over 300 men eminent in literature, science, the arts, law, public\r\noffices, churches, education, commerce, etc.; of its great procession\r\nand the demonstration in Albert Hall. She said of the other\r\norganization, which was yet in its early stages of aggressiveness:\r\n\"Opinions greatly differ in suffrage circles as to the effect produced\r\non the cause by what are known as 'militant' tactics. It is difficult\r\nfor one who is completely identified with constitutional methods to\r\njudge aright the total result of unconstitutional forms of agitation.\r\nThat the 'militants' have been courageous and self-sacraficing no one\r\ndenies. That they have provoked discussion and aroused attention is\r\nequally obvious and from these our cause always stands to gain. On the\r\nother hand many of us feel a profound conviction, which experience\r\nonly strengthens, that women are adopting a mistaken course in\r\nappealing to violence. Our business as women asking for justice is not\r\nto rely upon physical force but in the eternal principles of right and\r\njustice. Law abiding methods alienate no one while methods of violence\r\nand disorder create anti-suffragists by the hundreds.\"\r\n\r\nTo this convention, as to the one of the preceding year in Amsterdam,\r\nMrs. Pankhurst refused to send any representatives of the Women's\r\nSocial and Political Union. A mass meeting under its auspices was held\r\nin Albert Hall one evening and many of the delegates accepted an\r\nofficial invitation to attend.\r\n\r\nAt an afternoon session ten minute addresses were made by Mrs. Betsy\r\nKjelsberg of Norway on Six Years' Experience in Municipal Work; by\r\nMrs. Madge Donohoe for Australia, The Latest Victory; by Dr. phil.\r\nGulli Petrini of Sweden, Suffrage Work on Both Sides of the Polar\r\nCircle; by Mrs. Rutgers-Hoitsema, A Curious Football Game in Holland;\r\nothers by Mrs. Zeneide Mirovitch, Russia; Miss Theo. Daugaard,\r\nDenmark; Mlle. Daugotte, Belgium; Mme. Auberlet, France; Mrs. Saul\r\nSolomon, South Africa. The Dutch Men's League for Women Suffrage\r\nwas represented by E. J. van Straaten, LL.D. and F. F. W.\r\nKehrer-Gorinchens; the British by Herbert Jacobs and Dr. C. W.\r\nDrysdale. Mrs. Anna M. Haslam, fraternal delegate from the Irish\r\nWomen's Suffrage Association, and her husband, Thomas J., the oldest\r\ndelegates, were most cordially received. The Bohemian delegate, Marie\r\nTumova, could not be present because making a campaign for election to\r\nthe Diet.\r\n\r\nThe delegates had a strenuous time trying to attend the business\r\nmeetings, listen to the excellent programs of prominent speakers, go\r\nto the enjoyable social affairs and make the visits and excursions to\r\nthe many historical places in and around London which most of them had\r\nalways longed to see. The Executive Committee of the National Union,\r\nMrs. Fawcett, chairman, served as Reception Committee; its treasurer,\r\nMiss Bertha Mason, expended the large fund subscribed for the use of\r\nthe convention; the Press Committee managed the newspapers through\r\nMiss Compton Burnett; Mrs. Anstruther, Rutland House, Portland\r\nGardens, had the exacting but pleasant duties of chairman of the\r\nHospitality Committee.\r\n\r\nA delightful reception on Sunday evening, April 25, at the Lyceum\r\nClub, introduced the pleasures of the week, which ended with a\r\nhandsome reception given by the Men's League for Women's Suffrage on\r\nSaturday evening. There was a brilliant official dinner at Prince's\r\nRestaurant and there were teas and concerts and dramatic\r\nentertainments. To most of the delegates the weeks were the richest in\r\nexperience ever known, with the specially conducted visits to famous\r\nuniversities and schools; cathedrals and abbeys; galleries and\r\npalaces; courts and gardens--every spot filled with historic\r\nassociations for English speaking people and with intense interest for\r\nthose of other countries. For delegates concerned with civic and\r\nsocial work there was the keenest enjoyment in the specialized and\r\nextensive developments along many lines. The Minutes of the convention\r\nthus describe one of its leading events:\r\n\r\n     The mass meeting at the Royal Albert Hall under the auspices of\r\n     the London Society for Women's Suffrage afforded the delegates a\r\n     most impressive display of the earnestness of the British\r\n     suffragists. A procession of women engaged in various trades and\r\n     professions, carrying the emblems of their work, marched from\r\n     Eaton Square to the hall. It was a wonderful inspiration to the\r\n     brave bands of pioneers from other lands to see the long\r\n     procession march with fluttering flags and swinging lanterns\r\n     along the darkening streets, greeted now with sympathy, now with\r\n     jeers. As it entered the hall and trade after trade, profession\r\n     after profession filed past the platform on which were seated\r\n     women of all nations, the enthusiasm reached its height. It\r\n     would be impossible to give a list of the groups but especially\r\n     notable were the chain makers from Cradley Heath, who toil for\r\n     about four shillings per week of sixty hours. The common remark\r\n     that the suffrage movement is an amusement for rich women was\r\n     once for all disproved as the factory workers and cotton\r\n     operatives in their distinctive dress swung into the vast arena.\r\n     The group of women doctors in their gorgeous robes were loudly\r\n     cheered, as were the nurses and mid-wives who followed, while\r\n     teachers of all branches of the profession closed the long line.\r\n     There were notable speeches but the real effect of the meeting\r\n     lay in the wonderful gathering itself, women of all nations,\r\n     classes, creeds and occupations united for a common purpose,\r\n     together with men, filling one of the largest halls in Europe.\r\n     Mrs. Fawcett, LL.D., presided and the speakers were Ramsey\r\n     McDonald, M.P., Mrs. Catt, Dr. Shaw, Miss Frances Sterling and\r\n     Mrs. Philip Snowden.\r\n\r\nTwice during the convention it came in touch with royalty in an\r\ninteresting way. At the official dinner Mrs. Qvam, delegate from the\r\nNorwegian Government and president of the National Suffrage\r\nAssociation, brought greetings and wishes for the success of the\r\ncongress from Queen Maud of Norway, a daughter of King Edward and\r\nQueen Alexandra, to which an appreciative response was sent. At a\r\nmorning session the birth of a daughter to the Queen of the\r\nNetherlands was announced and at the request of Dr. Aletta Jacobs,\r\npresident of the National Suffrage Association of that country, a\r\ntelegram of congratulations from the Alliance was sent.\r\n\r\nThere was much discussion over the motion that all organizations\r\nauxiliary to the Alliance must have woman suffrage as their sole\r\nobject. It was finally decided in the affirmative and a flood of\r\nsocieties of every description was excluded. The number of delegates\r\npermitted to each country was increased from six to twelve, with\r\ntwelve alternates. A resolution was adopted urging the National\r\nSuffrage Association of each nation to prepare a comprehensive\r\nstatement of the laws which place women at a disadvantage in regard to\r\nproperty, earnings, marriage, divorce, guardianship of children,\r\neducation, industrial conditions and political rights, and to explain,\r\nwhen demanding their immediate enfranchisement from their respective\r\nParliaments, that they consider these injustices can be effectively\r\nremoved only through joint political action by men and women. This\r\nwas introduced at the request of Lady McLaren, who had prepared such a\r\ncharter for Great Britain. Many beautiful designs for a flag and\r\nbanner had been submitted and it was found that the one selected was\r\nthe work of Miss Branting of Sweden. The international hymn chosen\r\nfrom a number which were submitted was written by Mrs. Theodora Flower\r\nMills.\r\n\r\nAs this was the quinquennial meeting officers were elected. Mrs. Catt\r\nwas unanimously re-elected and the following received large\r\nmajorities: Mrs. Fawcett, first, and Miss Furuhjelm, second\r\nvice-presidents; Miss Martina Kramers, Netherlands; Mrs. Anna\r\nLindemann, Germany; Miss Signe Bergman, Sweden, first, second and\r\nthird secretaries; Mrs. Stanton Coit, treasurer. As the time of\r\nholding the regular session of the Alliance was changed from five to\r\nfour years they were elected to hold office until 1913. Mrs. Catt\r\nwelcomed the new officers and warmly thanked the retiring officers for\r\ntheir valuable services. The invitation to hold the congress of 1911\r\nin Stockholm, if the political conditions were favorable, was accepted\r\nwith pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe Resolutions presented by the committee--Miss Frances Sterling,\r\nGreat Britain; Mrs. E. R. Mirrlees, South Africa; Mrs. Ida Husted\r\nHarper, United States--and adopted, summarized the gains of the past\r\nfew years in Denmark, Iceland, Sweden, Germany, Netherlands, Bohemia,\r\nCape Colony and the Transvaal and said: \"This Congress, remembering\r\nthe lessons of history, urges the National Societies not to be\r\nbetrayed into postponing their claim for the enfranchisement of women\r\nfor any other object, whether it be the further extension of the\r\nsuffrage to men or the success of some political party.\" At the last\r\nmeeting of the delegates Mrs. Catt thanked them for their hearty\r\ncooperation with their president; she urged them to demand the\r\nsuffrage upon the broadest basis, namely, that the government may rest\r\nequally on the will of both men and women, and said the Alliance would\r\nwield great influence if they remained united and they would secure\r\nthe enfranchisement of the women of the world for all future\r\ngenerations. A public meeting in St. James Hall was held on the last\r\nevening with Mrs. Catt in the chair and addresses of the highest order\r\nwere made by Miss Margaret Ashton, Men and Women; the Rev. Ivory\r\nCripps, the Nation's Need of Women; Miss Rosika Schwimmer, The\r\nHungarian Outlook; H. Y. Stanger, M.P., The Prospect of Franchise\r\nReform; Dr. Käthe Schirmacher, Woman Suffrage.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday afternoon preceding the convention the Rev. Anna Howard\r\nShaw preached for a Men's Meeting at Whitefield's, Tottenham Court\r\nRoad, the most of the large and interested audience hearing for the\r\nfirst time a sermon by a woman. On the Sunday following the convention\r\nshe preached in the morning for the West London Ethical Society in the\r\nKensington Town Hall and in the evening at the King's Weigh House\r\nChapel, Duke Street, Grosvenor Square. At 3 o'clock in the afternoon\r\nthe Rev. Canon Scott Holland gave a sermon in St. Paul's Cathedral,\r\nthe national church, on the Religious Aspect of Women's Suffrage, with\r\ntwo hundred seats reserved for the delegates, and they felt a deep\r\nthrill of rejoicing at hearing within those ancient walls a strong\r\nplea for the enfranchisement of women. They were invited to attend the\r\nnext evening a symposium by the Shakespeare League at King's College\r\non What Shakespeare Thought of Women.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIXTH CONFERENCE OF THE ALLIANCE.\r\n\r\nThe Sixth Conference and Congress of the International Woman Suffrage\r\nAlliance took place in the banquet hall of the Grand Hotel, Stockholm,\r\nJune 12-17, 1911. The coming of Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, president of\r\nthe Alliance, had been widely heralded. She had been received in\r\nCopenhagen with national honors by cabinet ministers and foreign\r\nlegations; the American flag run up for her wherever she went and the\r\nDanish colors dipped and there was almost a public ovation. In\r\nChristiania she was met with a greeting from a former Prime Minister\r\nand an official address of welcome from the Government and was\r\nreceived by King Haakon. At Stockholm she was met by deputations with\r\nflowers and speeches. Dinners, receptions and concerts followed. The\r\nAmerican and Swedish flags waved together. The whole city knew that\r\nsomething important was going to happen. In the midst of it all the\r\nwoman suffrage bill came up for discussion in both Houses of the\r\nParliament. The international president was escorted to the Lower\r\nHouse by a body of women that crowded the galleries. After a stormy\r\ndebate the bill to enfranchise the women of Sweden received a majority\r\nvote. In the midst of the applause Mrs. Catt was hurried to the Upper\r\nChamber, the stronghold of caste and conservatism. Her presence and\r\nthat of the flower of Swedish womanhood did not save the bill from the\r\nusual defeat.\r\n\r\nThe congress opened with representatives from twenty-four affiliated\r\nNational Associations and two Committees, those of Austria and\r\nBohemia. The government of Norway sent as its official delegate Dr.\r\nKristine Bonnevie. The list of delegates filled seven printed pages,\r\nthe United States, the Netherlands and Sweden having the full quota of\r\ntwelve delegates and twelve alternates, Germany lacking only three of\r\nthe latter, while Great Britain, France, Denmark, Norway, Finland and\r\nHungary had twelve or more. Six were present from Russia; Bulgaria,\r\nServia, Switzerland, South Africa, Iceland and Canada had\r\nrepresentatives. Of fraternal delegates from other organizations there\r\nwas no end--about seventy men and women--among them members of five\r\nMen's Leagues for Woman Suffrage--in the United States, Great Britain,\r\nNetherlands, Hungary and Sweden. In addition to the spoken words\r\nletters and telegrams of greeting were read from societies and\r\nindividuals in twelve different countries. The distinguished guests of\r\nthe occasion were Dr. Selma Lagerlöf of Sweden, who had recently\r\nreceived the Nobel Literature Prize, and Miss Helena Westermarck of\r\nFinland, the eminent writer and publicist. Among prominent speakers\r\nwere Mayor Carl Lindhagen and Ernest Beckman, M. P., the Rev. K. H. G.\r\nvon Scheele, Bishop of Visby, and the Rev. Dr. Samuel Fries. The\r\nushers and pages were women students of the universities.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday afternoon preceding the convention the precedent of all\r\npast ages was broken when Dr. Anna Howard Shaw preached in the ancient\r\nState Church of Gusta Vasa. When the Swedish women asked for the use\r\nof the church they were told that this could be granted only to a\r\nminister of the same denomination but they learned that when a\r\nminister from another country was visiting Sweden the pastor of the\r\nchurch might invite him to occupy his pulpit at his discretion. The\r\npastor said he would run the risk, knowing that he might incur the\r\ndispleasure of the Bishop, and Dr. Shaw, therefore, felt a double\r\nresponsibility. She could not enter the pulpit, however, but spoke\r\nfrom a platform in front of it. It was a never to be forgotten scene.\r\nThe grand old church was crowded to the last inch of space, although\r\nadmission was by ticket. Facing the chancel were the thirty famous\r\nwomen singers of Göteborg, their cantor a woman, and the noted woman\r\norganist and composer, Elfrida Andrée, who composed the music for the\r\noccasion. In the center of all was the little black-robed minister. It\r\nwas said by many to be the most wonderful sermon of her life and after\r\nthe service was over the pastor, with tears rolling down his cheeks,\r\nwent up to her with hands outstretched and taking both of hers said:\r\n\"I am the happiest man in Sweden.\" Sunday evening a reception was\r\ngiven at the Restaurant Rosenbad to the officers, presidents of\r\nnational auxiliaries and Swedish Committee of Arrangements by its\r\nchairman, Mrs. Bertha Nordenson. At six o'clock excursions of many\r\ndelegates had started to enjoy the long evening when the sun did not\r\nset till nearly midnight.\r\n\r\nThe official report of the first executive session Monday morning\r\nsaid: \"Miss Janet Richards, delegate from the U. S. A., with an\r\nadmirable speech, presented to the Alliance from the State which had\r\nrecently given full suffrage to women a gavel bearing the inscription:\r\n\"To the International W. S. A. from the Washington Equal Suffrage\r\nAssociation.\" It was announced that National Suffrage Associations had\r\nbeen formed in Iceland and Servia and they were gladly accepted as\r\nauxiliaries, bringing the number up to twenty-six. The municipality\r\nhad contributed 3,000 crowns to the congress, which proved to be the\r\nlargest ever held in Stockholm. Season tickets had been sold to 1,200\r\npersons and other hundreds bought tickets to the various meetings.\r\nDuring the entire week the flags of the nations represented at the\r\ncongress floated from the flagstaffs that lined the quay in front of\r\nthe Grand Hotel facing the royal palace, as far as the eye could\r\nreach. All the time Mrs. Catt was in the city the American flag was\r\nrun up for her as a public guest wherever she went and the Swedish\r\ncolors dipped a salute.\r\n\r\nThe Congress was formally opened in the afternoon of June 12 with\r\naddresses of welcome from Miss Anna Whitlock, acting president of the\r\nNational Suffrage Association of Sweden, and the Hon. Ernest Beckman,\r\nM. P., president of the National Swedish Liberal Association, and\r\nresponse from the Alliance was made by Miss Chrystal Macmillan of\r\nGreat Britain, proxy for Mrs. Millicent Garrett Fawcett, its first\r\nvice-president. Miss Anna Kleman, president of the Stockholm suffrage\r\nsociety, then presented the beautiful white satin, gold embroidered\r\nAlliance banner, which was carried by six university students in white\r\ndresses with sashes of the Swedish colors. Mrs. Catt announced that\r\nthe Alliance flag was now flying over the Grand Hotel where they were\r\nassembled. The banner was the gift of Miss Lotten von Kroemer, a\r\npioneer suffragist of Sweden, and the flag of the resident Atlantic,\r\nGulf and Pacific Tea Co., U. S. A. A suffrage song written by K. G.\r\nOssian-Nillson and the music composed by Hugo Alfven for the occasion\r\nwas sung by the Women's Choir of Göteborg, after which an official\r\ndelegate of the Government extended its greeting while the audience\r\nrose and the flags of the nations waved from the galleries. Mrs. Catt\r\nreceived an ovation as she came to the front of the platform to make\r\nher address. It filled twenty-three pages of the printed minutes and\r\nwas a complete resumé of the early position of women, the vast changes\r\nthat had been wrought and the great work which the Alliance was doing.\r\nOnly a few quotations are possible:\r\n\r\n     In the recent debate on the bill in the Swedish Parliament a\r\n     university professor said in a tone of eloquent finality: \"The\r\n     woman suffrage movement has reached and passed its climax; the\r\n     suffrage wave is now rapidly receding.\" With patronizing air,\r\n     more droll than he could know, the gentleman added: \"We have\r\n     permitted this movement to come thus far but we shall allow it to\r\n     go no farther.\" Thus another fly resting upon the proverbial\r\n     wheel of progress commanded it to turn no more. This man engages\r\n     our attention because he is a representative of a type to be\r\n     found in all our lands; wise men on the wrong side of a great\r\n     question, modern Joshuas who command the sun to stand still and\r\n     believe that it will obey.\r\n\r\n     Long centuries before the birth of Darwin an old-time Hindoo\r\n     wrote: \"I stand on a river's bank. I know not whence the waters\r\n     come or whither they go. So deep and silent is its current that I\r\n     know not whether it flows north or south; all is mystery to me;\r\n     but when I climb yon summit the river becomes a silver thread\r\n     weaving its length in and out among the hills and over the\r\n     plains. I see it all from its source in yonder mountain to its\r\n     outlet in yonder sea. There is no more mystery.\" So these\r\n     university professors buried in school books, these near-sighted\r\n     politicians, fail to note the meaning of passing events. To them\r\n     the woman movement is an inexplicable mystery, but to us standing\r\n     upon the summit of international union, where we may observe\r\n     every manifestation of this movement in all parts of the world,\r\n     there is no mystery. From its sources ages ago, amid the protests\r\n     which we know barbaric women must have made against the cruel\r\n     wrongs done their sex, we clearly trace its course through the\r\n     centuries, moving slowly but majestically onward, gathering\r\n     momentum with each century, each generation, until just before us\r\n     lies the golden sea of woman's full liberty.\r\n\r\nMrs. Catt traced the progress of the ages until it culminated in the\r\ndemand for political rights for women, told of the beginning of the\r\nAlliance and said: \"Today, seven years later, our Alliance counts 26\r\nauxiliary national associations. Are these evidences of a wave rapidly\r\nreceding? It would be more in accordance with facts should we adopt\r\nthe proud boast of the British Empire and say that the sun now never\r\nsets upon woman suffrage activities. The subscribing membership in the\r\nworld has increased seven times in the past seven years and it has\r\ndoubled since the London congress two years ago. Even in Great\r\nBritain, where the opposition declared at that time very confidently\r\nthat the campaign had reached its climax, the National Union, our\r\nauxiliary, has tripled its individual membership, tripled its\r\nauxiliary societies and doubled its funds since then, and twelve\r\nindependent suffrage societies have been organized. The membership and\r\ncampaign funds have likewise tripled in the United States and every\r\npresident of an auxiliary national society has reported increase in\r\nnumbers, funds and activity.... No human power, no university\r\nprofessor, no Parliament, no government, can stay the coming of woman\r\nsuffrage. It is a step in the evolution of society and the eternal\r\nverities are behind it.... Of the 24 nations represented in this\r\ncongress the women of 15 have more political rights than they had\r\nseven years ago.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Catt paid high tribute to the Scandinavian people and eulogized\r\nFredrika Bremer, Sweden's great pioneer. In speaking of the progress\r\nin this country she said: \"Municipal suffrage has now been extended\r\nto married women and eligibility to office to all women. Organizations\r\nexist in 170 towns, some of them north of the Arctic Circle; there is\r\na paying membership of 12,000 and 1,550 meetings have been held in the\r\nlast two years. Two political parties espouse the cause. Women may\r\nvote for town and county councils, which elect the Upper House of\r\nParliament, and thirty-seven are serving on these councils.\" She\r\nreferred eloquently to the honored Selma Lagerlöf and to Dr. Lydia\r\nWahlstrom, the recent president of the National Suffrage Association,\r\nwho had been crowned with a laurel wreath for her wisdom by the\r\nUniversity of Upsala. She told of a questionnaire she had sent to the\r\npresidents of the national suffrage associations in all countries\r\nasking what were the indications that the woman suffrage movement was\r\ngrowing and said: \"Such volumes of evidence of progress were received\r\nthat it is quite impossible to give an idea of its far reaching\r\ncharacter....[223]\r\n\r\nAt the official reception given by the National Suffrage Association\r\nof Sweden in the evening the guests were welcomed by Mrs. Ann Margret\r\nHolmgren and their appreciative responses were made by Mrs. Margaret\r\nHodge, Australia; Miss Gabriella Danzerova, Bohemia; Mrs. Daisy Minor,\r\nAustria; Miss Helen Clay-Petersen, Denmark; Miss Annie Furuhjelm,\r\nFinland; Madam DeWitt Schlumberger, France; Dr. jur. Anita Augspurg,\r\nGermany; Mrs. Olga Ungar, Hungary; Mrs. Philip Snowden, Great Britain.\r\nThese were followed by a cantata beautifully rendered by the Göteborg\r\nchoir, words and music by women.\r\n\r\nDuring the convention Lieutenant Colonel W. A. E. Mansfeldt of Holland\r\nmade the report for its Men's League for Woman Suffrage; Dr. C. V.\r\nDrysdale for Great Britain; Jean du Breuil for France; Dr. Alexander\r\nPatai for Hungary; Frederick Nathan for the United States, and the\r\nfounding of an International Men's League was announced with Colonel\r\nMansfeldt secretary.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the work of the different branches and their\r\ndiscussion, bringing before the Alliance the experience and opinions\r\nof women from all parts of the world, were perhaps the most valuable\r\nfeature of the conference. The most animated and vital of these\r\ndiscussions was the one of a political nature, divided into three\r\nparts: 1. What political work have the women of the enfranchised\r\ncountries done, what is their relation to the different parties and\r\nhow do these treat them? Have they any advice to offer? led by Miss\r\nHodge, Mrs. Louise Keilhau, Norway; Dr. Tekla Hultin, M. P., Finland.\r\n2. How can woman's political influence be brought to bear most\r\neffectively on Parliaments and governments? Led by Mrs. Snowden; Mrs.\r\nAnna B. Wicksell, Sweden; Dr. Käthe Schirmacher, Germany; Miss\r\nRichards. 3. What should be the relation of the suffrage movement to\r\npolitical parties in the unenfranchised countries? Led by Miss Eline\r\nHansen, Denmark; Miss Rosika Schwimmer, Hungary; Madame Pichon,\r\nFrance; Mrs. Zeneide Mirovitch, Russia. There was a wide divergence of\r\nopinion but at last a resolution was unanimously adopted that \"woman\r\nsuffrage societies do their best work when organized in a non-partisan\r\nmanner.\" In order to remove persistent misunderstanding a statement\r\npresented by Mrs. Catt was adopted explaining the wording of the\r\nresolution demanding \"the franchise for women on the same terms as it\r\nis or may be exercised by men.\" It declared that the Alliance had on\r\nno occasion taken a position for or against any special form of\r\nsuffrage but that the affiliated societies were left entirely free to\r\ndetermine for themselves which form they would demand. The Alliance\r\ndid not express an opinion as to what should be the qualifications for\r\nenfranchisement, its sole object being to establish the principle that\r\nsex should not be a disqualification.\r\n\r\nNo more eminent group of women speakers ever appeared before an\r\naudience than those who spoke in the Royal Opera House of Stockholm on\r\nthe second evening of the convention. Mrs. Catt presided and addresses\r\nwere made by Miss Westermarck, Dr. Augspurg, Mrs. Snowden, Miss\r\nSchwimmer, Dr. Shaw and Sweden's best beloved Selma Lagerlöf. The last\r\nnamed moved the audience to tears during her address on Home and State\r\nby her impassioned plea for the enfranchisement of women. It was said\r\nby delegates from the various countries who had attended many of these\r\ninternational gatherings that this meeting surpassed all others.\r\nAnother which differed from all that had gone before was the great\r\ngathering in Skansen, the magnificent park, where at 7 o'clock, from\r\ntwo platforms, noted speakers from ten countries addressed an audience\r\nof thousands. A dinner followed in the park house, Högenloft, with\r\nfine music, and then in the open air the visitors saw the famous\r\nnational dances and processions by the young people in the picturesque\r\ncostumes of the country.\r\n\r\nAlthough the official languages of the Alliance were French, German\r\nand English a crowded meeting was held one evening in the People's\r\nHouse with the speeches in the northern tongues, understood by all the\r\nScandinavian people. It was opened by Mayor Lindhagen, an ardent\r\nadvocate of woman suffrage. At another session the Woman Question in\r\nthe Russian Parliament was considered by the noted woman leader, Dr.\r\nShiskin-Yavein; the Suffrage Outlook in Bohemia by Miss Maria Tumova,\r\nrecent candidate for Parliament; the Future of South African Women by\r\nMiss Nina Boyle. A special meeting was held one afternoon in the hall\r\nof the Young Women's Christian Association. Mrs. Marie Stritt,\r\nGermany; Mme. Maria Verone, France, and Miss Macmillan were appointed\r\nto compile a pamphlet of information about woman suffrage in all lands\r\nto be used for propaganda work.\r\n\r\nA delegate from the United States, Professor Mary Gray Peck,\r\nofficially connected with its national suffrage headquarters, gave the\r\nfollowing description in a letter to the press:\r\n\r\n     The ball room of the Grand Hotel where the meetings were held is\r\n     a palatial apartment, its walls richly gilded and adorned with\r\n     long mirrors between the windows, while from the ceiling hang\r\n     great crystal chandeliers, which were always lighted while the\r\n     congress was in session. The platform for officers and\r\n     distinguished guests was placed between gilded pillars at one end\r\n     of the hall, draped and canopied with the national colors of\r\n     Sweden, blue and yellow, and the international suffrage colors,\r\n     yellow and white. Then there is the memory of other places where\r\n     the delegates assembled, the ancient State Church, with its\r\n     reminder of St. Paul's in London; the splendid Academy of Music,\r\n     with the heraldic banners of the nations suspended around the\r\n     gallery; the Royal Opera House with its tiers of balconies and\r\n     the rising of the curtain to show the beautiful stage picture of\r\n     the speakers and the arch of flowers beneath which they spoke;\r\n     the Moorish court in the Royal Hotel, where the reception was\r\n     held, with the delightful Birgitta cantata, recalling the heroic\r\n     in Swedish womanhood; the open air meeting at Skansen with the\r\n     native songs and dances; the farewell in the garden at\r\n     Saltsjöbaden, given by the Stockholm society; the peasant singing\r\n     and the wonderful ride back to the city by late northern twilight\r\n     and moonlight together.\r\n\r\n     The closing speech of the congress made by the international\r\n     president at the close of the dinner at Saltsjöbaden was\r\n     something indescribable. She stood on a balcony facing the sunset\r\n     sky and blue sea, with pine trees forming an amphitheater in the\r\n     background. It was like a triumphant recessional, with\r\n     benediction for the past and challenge for the future, and when\r\n     the speaker descended from the balcony and went down to the boat\r\n     landing followed by the singing of the peasants, the crowd\r\n     divided, leaving a wide path, and stood gazing after her as\r\n     though she were too imperial to be followed by anything but\r\n     music.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday following the congress an excursion was arranged on\r\nbeautiful Lake Malaren to the ancient Castle of Gripsholm, where\r\nevening dinner was served. The city council and the State railways\r\nfinancially assisted the Entertainment Committee. At all of the\r\nAlliance congresses the social entertainments were a marked feature.\r\nThe hospitality was boundless and each country had its historic places\r\nand beautiful resorts which differed so much from those of all others\r\nas to give them an indescribable charm and interest. Following is part\r\nof the report of this one by Mrs. Anna Lindemann, secretary of the\r\nAlliance:[224]\r\n\r\n     The official entertainments were most appropriately opened by the\r\n     truly international greeting which Mrs. Holmgren, one of the\r\n     founders of the Swedish suffrage movement, addressed to the\r\n     guests at the reception in the Grand Hotel Royal. Her words which\r\n     gave a hearty welcome to the French and German-speaking guests\r\n     and to our Swedish sisters in their several languages; the\r\n     beautiful cantata written by Sigrid Leijonhufvud, the music\r\n     composed by Alfrida Andree specially for this occasion, and last\r\n     but not least the presence of the woman all of us had long known\r\n     and loved before we saw her, Selma Lagerlöf, made us feel at home\r\n     in Sweden at once. This feeling deepened as time went on and\r\n     Wednesday evening at Skansen a new note was added. All we saw of\r\n     Swedish nature and Swedish life in that beautiful open air\r\n     museum, the national dances, the characteristic art of Sven\r\n     Scholander and his daughter Lisa, gave us a deeper understanding\r\n     of the people whose guests we were and showed us some of the\r\n     roots from which it draws its strength. Another aspect also, the\r\n     refined culture of modern Sweden, was the dominant note of the\r\n     dinner at Hasselbacken with the heartfelt speech of the venerable\r\n     Bishop Scheele of Visby.\r\n\r\n     On a background of lovely scenery this week will stand out in our\r\n     memory as one long summer day with a long, long evening full of\r\n     silver light.... During the carriage drive generously provided by\r\n     Miss Lotten von Kraemer our hearts were gladdened by the many\r\n     expressions of sympathy we met on our way, from the dear old\r\n     women, who waved their handkerchiefs and their aprons, down to\r\n     small girls by the side of their mothers.... Especially the day\r\n     at Upsala, by invitation of its suffrage society, will not be\r\n     forgotten. The warm-hearted reception, the gay flags all through\r\n     the town, at once lifted up the spirit of the whole gathering,\r\n     which found a charming expression in the improvised festive\r\n     procession from the botanical garden to the cathedral. The\r\n     presence and eloquence of the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw gave an added\r\n     dignity to this as to many others of our social gatherings.\r\n     Schools, hospitals, museums, exhibitions of all kinds of women's\r\n     art and women's work, were visited.... [The many private\r\n     invitations were referred to.] The thirty-six delegates, who\r\n     accepted Mrs. Caroline Benedick-Bruce's invitation to the Island\r\n     of Visby, have told us that words failed to describe this\r\n     beautiful day.\r\n\r\n     Looking back on the time that lies behind us, we, the women who\r\n     have come here from all over the world, thank our Swedish sisters\r\n     for the inspiration their kindness and their loving reception\r\n     have been to us. We thank Sweden for the splendid women it has\r\n     produced. We have seen the many elements that have worked\r\n     together to attain this result; we have learned to admire and\r\n     respect Swedish history, Swedish culture, Swedish art; and as,\r\n     besides the many other things this congress has done for us, it\r\n     has most specially taught us to love the Swedish women, we can\r\n     express no better wish for our future conventions than that every\r\n     new country which receives us may in the same way widen our\r\n     hearts by a new love.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVENTH CONFERENCE OF THE ALLIANCE.\r\n\r\nThe International Woman Suffrage Alliance held its Seventh Conference\r\nand Congress in Budapest June 15-21, 1913. As had been the case with\r\nall that had preceded, the place of meeting had been chosen with\r\nreference to the situation in regard to woman suffrage where the\r\nprospect for it seemed favorable and it was desired to influence\r\npublic sentiment by showing that the movement for it was world-wide.\r\nWhen it had been announced at the congress in Stockholm that the next\r\none would be held in the capital of Hungary it had seemed very far\r\naway and that country was not associated with representative\r\ngovernment. It proved to be, however, one of the largest and most\r\nimportant of the conventions and its efforts were widespread, as the\r\ndelegates stopped en route for mass meetings and public banquets in\r\nBerlin, Dresden, Prague and Vienna. Twenty-two countries were\r\nrepresented by 240 delegates and alternates. The full quota of 24 were\r\npresent from Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, Great Britain, the United\r\nStates and Hungary; Finland sent 15; Denmark and Norway 11 each;\r\nSwitzerland 9: Italy 8; Russia 5; Belgium and Austria, 4 each; from\r\nSouth Africa came 4, from Iceland, 2; from Canada, 3; from Bohemia\r\none.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a cosmopolitan assemblage. The government of Australia\r\nhad an official delegate, Mrs. Frederick Spencer, and that of Norway\r\ntwo, the president of the National Suffrage Association, Mrs. F. M.\r\nQvam, and the president of the National Council of Women, Miss Gina\r\nKrog. The Governors of California, Oregon and Washington had appointed\r\nrepresentatives. Written or telegraphed greetings were received from\r\nnineteen countries, encircling the globe. The question of fraternal\r\ndelegates reached its climax, as 163 were present from twelve\r\ncountries, all wishing to offer their greetings and a large number\r\nintending to advocate the particular object of their organizations. A\r\nresolution was finally adopted that no credentials should be accepted\r\nuntil the society presenting them should be approved by the National\r\nSuffrage Association of its country and no fraternal delegate should\r\nspeak except by invitation of the president of the Alliance and with\r\nthe consent of the congress. This checked a torrent of oratory and\r\nallowed the convention to carry out its program. The Chinese Woman\r\nSuffrage Society was admitted, for which Mrs. Catt had sowed the seeds\r\nat the time of her visit to that country, and the beautifully\r\nembroidered banner they had sent was presented to the Alliance by Dr.\r\nAletta Jacobs, president of the Netherlands Association, who had\r\naccompanied her. She said in part:\r\n\r\n     It is difficult to speak to an audience which certainly does not\r\n     know the Chinese women in their own land, an audience of which\r\n     only a few have had the privilege to hear from the lips of those\r\n     feet-bound women what an important part they have taken in the\r\n     revolution of their country and in the political reform which has\r\n     resulted from it; to make you clearly understand the spirit of\r\n     these Chinese women when they offered this banner to Mrs. Catt,\r\n     as president of the Alliance, in gratitude for what it is doing\r\n     for the uplifting of womanhood, and when they expressed their\r\n     hope that it would take the Chinese women under its care. You\r\n     have not been, as Mrs. Catt and I have, in the south of the\r\n     country, where we saw Chinese women sitting in Parliament but\r\n     from whom the vote is now taken away. You have not heard, as we\r\n     did, in many towns, the Chinese women speak in crowded meetings\r\n     to a mixed, enthusiastic audience with an eloquence none of us\r\n     can surpass. You can not imagine how hard is the struggle for\r\n     liberty which they have to make. In every town we found\r\n     intelligent women with the same love for freedom as inspires us,\r\n     who hunger after righteousness just as we do and who devote not\r\n     only all their money but their entire life to the struggle for\r\n     the improvement of the position of the women of their country.\r\n\r\n     Many of the Chinese women have already been decapitated for the\r\n     truth they have told while fighting their battle for freedom and\r\n     all the leaders of the woman movement know that their life is\r\n     uncertain and that any day the men may find a reason to silence\r\n     them when their eloquence and enthusiasm make too many converts.\r\n     In translating the words which they embroidered upon this bright\r\n     red satin you will learn what is going on in the minds of the new\r\n     Chinese women: \"The Mutual Helping Society to the International\r\n     Alliance. Helping each other, all of one mind.\" In the name of\r\n     these Chinese women I ask you to accept this banner in the same\r\n     loyal spirit in which it is offered and to welcome the Chinese\r\n     suffragists into our Alliance.\r\n\r\nA handsome banner was presented by the delegation from Galicia. The\r\npresident of the Belgian Association reported that Roman Catholic,\r\nConservative, Socialist and Progressive women had united in a\r\nnon-partisan federation to work only for woman suffrage. South Africa,\r\nRoumania and Portugal associations were received in full membership\r\nand also a committee from Galicia, where women were not allowed to\r\nform an association. Greetings came by cable from the women of Persia.\r\n\r\nNo tribute can do justice to the genius of Rosika Schwimmer in\r\narranging for this remarkable convention, the first of the kind ever\r\nheld in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Both the government and the\r\nmunicipality made liberal contributions, which the citizens\r\nsupplemented with more than enough to pay the entire expenses of the\r\ncongress, that was conducted on a liberal scale. A sale of 2,800\r\nseason tickets was made. Through the assistance of capable committees\r\nevery effort possible was made for the comfort and pleasure of the\r\ndelegates, who were cared for from the moment they arrived at the\r\nstation. English speaking university students and others of education\r\nhelped to overcome the extreme difficulties of the language. So many\r\ndelightful expeditions into the wonderful country had been provided\r\nthrough the courtesy of the railroads and navigation company that it\r\nrequired a strong sense of duty for the delegates to attend to the\r\nbusiness of the convention. A reception given Saturday evening by the\r\nNational Suffrage Association at the Gerbaud Pavilion enabled\r\nofficers, delegates and members of the committees to begin\r\nacquaintance and friendship.\r\n\r\nAccording to the custom of the country the convention was opened on\r\nSunday afternoon. Dr. Anna Howard Shaw had conducted religious\r\nservices in the morning at the Protestant church in Buda, assisted by\r\nthe Rev. Eliza Tupper Wilkes, by courtesy of its minister, the Rev.\r\nBenno Haypal. At four o'clock a large and cordial audience assembled\r\nin the grand Academy of Music for the official welcome, which began\r\nwith an overture by the orchestra of the National theater, composed\r\nfor the occasion by Dr. Aladar Renyi. A special ode written by Emil\r\nAbranyi was beautifully recited in Hungarian by Maria Jaszai and in\r\nEnglish by Erzsi Paulay, both actresses from the National Theater.\r\nGreetings were given by Countess Teleki, chairman of the Committee of\r\nArrangements, and Miss Vilma Glücklich, president of the National\r\nSuffrage Association. The official welcome of the Government was\r\nextended by His Excellency Dr. Bela de Jankovics, Minister of\r\nEducation, in an eloquent speech, and that of the city by Dr. Stephen\r\nde Barczy, the Burgomaster, who was very imposing in the robes and\r\ninsignia of his high office. The response for the Alliance was made by\r\nits secretary, Dr. Anna Lindemann, in German and French. Dr.\r\nAlexander Geisswein, a prominent member of Parliament, made a strong\r\naddress in favor of woman suffrage. These ceremonies were followed by\r\nthe president's address of Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, a summing up of\r\nthe world situation in regard to woman suffrage, during which she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     When the organization of the Alliance was completed in 1904, it\r\n     was decided that national woman suffrage associations only should\r\n     be admitted to membership and a nation was defined as a country\r\n     which possesses the independent right to enfranchise its women.\r\n     At that time eight such nations had woman suffrage associations.\r\n     Now, nine years later, with the exception of the Spanish American\r\n     Republics, there are in the entire world only seven without an\r\n     organized woman suffrage movement. Only three of these are in\r\n     Europe--Greece, Spain, and the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg. The\r\n     remaining four are not well established self-governing nations,\r\n     and Japan, which is more autocratic than democratic. We shall\r\n     admit to membership the Chinese Woman Suffrage Association and\r\n     the standard of the Alliance will then be set upon five\r\n     continents. Twenty-five nations will be counted in its\r\n     membership. Organized suffrage groups also exist on many islands\r\n     of the seas. Like Alexander the Great, we shall soon be looking\r\n     for other worlds to conquer! The North Star and the Southern\r\n     Cross alike cast their benignant rays upon woman suffrage\r\n     activities. Last winter when perpetual darkness shrouded the land\r\n     of the Midnight Sun, women wrapped in furs, above the Polar\r\n     Circle, might have been seen gliding over snow-covered roads in\r\n     sledges drawn by reindeer on their way to suffrage meetings, from\r\n     whence petitions went to the Parliament at Stockholm. At the same\r\n     moment other women, in the midsummer of the southern hemisphere,\r\n     protected by fans and umbrellas and riding in \"rickshas,\" were\r\n     doing the same thing under the fierce rays of a tropical sun;\r\n     while petitions poured into the Parliament asking suffrage for\r\n     the women of the Union of South Africa from every State and city\r\n     of that vast country.\r\n\r\n     Since our last Congress not one sign has appeared the entire\r\n     world around to indicate reaction. Not a backward step has been\r\n     taken. On the contrary a thousand revelations give certain,\r\n     unchallenged promise that victory for our great cause lies just\r\n     ahead.... During the past winter woman suffrage bills have been\r\n     considered by seventeen national Parliaments, four Parliaments of\r\n     countries without full national rights and in the legislative\r\n     bodies of twenty-nine States.... The largest gains for the past\r\n     two years have been in the United States. Five western States and\r\n     the Territory of Alaska have followed the example of the four\r\n     former equal suffrage States and have enfranchised their women.\r\n     Now 2,000,000 women are entitled to vote at all elections and are\r\n     eligible to all offices, including that of President.... If\r\n     France, Germany, Great Britain, Austria and Hungary could be set\r\n     down in the middle of this territory, there would be enough left\r\n     uncovered to equal the kingdom of Italy in size.\r\n\r\nMrs. Catt spoke of the trip of Dr. Jacobs and herself around the world\r\nand said: \"We held public meetings in many of the towns and cities of\r\nfour continents, of four large islands and on the ships of three\r\noceans and had representatives of all the great races and\r\nnationalities in our audiences. We are now in touch with the most\r\nadvanced development of the woman's movement in Egypt, Palestine,\r\nIndia, Burmah, China, Japan, Java and the Philippine and Hawaiian\r\nIslands, and also in Turkey and Persia, which we did not visit.\"\r\n\r\nIn telling of the momentous changes taking place in the East she said:\r\n\"Behind the purdah in India, in the harems of Mohammedanism, behind\r\nveils and barred doors and closed sedan chairs there has been\r\nrebellion in the hearts of women all down the centuries.... We spoke\r\nwith many women all over the East who had never heard of a 'woman's\r\nmovement,' yet isolated and alone they had thought out the entire\r\nprogram of woman's emancipation, not excluding the vote....\" She\r\nreviewed at length the position of women in Persia, in India and in\r\nAsia, the influence of the various religions and the signs of\r\nprogress, paying a tribute to Mrs. Annie Besant, to the teachings of\r\ntheosophy and especially to those of the Bahais. The terrible\r\nconditions for wage-earning women, the child labor and the nearly\r\nunrestricted white slave traffic in the far East were feelingly\r\ndescribed and the address, which had been heard with almost breathless\r\ninterest, concluded:\r\n\r\n     The women of the western world are escaping from the thraldom of\r\n     the centuries.... Their liberation is certain; a little more\r\n     effort, a little more enlightenment and it will come. Out of the\r\n     richness of our own freedom must we give aid to these sisters of\r\n     ours in Asia. When I review the slow, tragic struggle upward of\r\n     the women of the West I am overwhelmed with the awfulness of the\r\n     task these Eastern women have assumed. They must follow the\r\n     vision in their souls as we have done and as other women before\r\n     us have done. My heart yearns to give them aid and comfort. I\r\n     would that we could strengthen them for the coming struggle. I\r\n     would that we could put a protecting arm around these heroic\r\n     women and save them from the cruel blows they are certain to\r\n     receive. Alas! we can only help them to help themselves. Every\r\n     Western victory will give them encouragement and inspiration,\r\n     for our victories are their victories and their defeats are our\r\n     defeats. For every woman of every tribe and nation, every race\r\n     and continent, now under the heel of oppression we must demand\r\n     deliverance.\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday evening after the opening of the convention the Royal\r\nOpera, a State institution, gave a special gala performance of\r\nMozart's Entfuhrung aus dem Serail, with Cupid's Tricks, by the full\r\nballet. This was complimentary to the visitors, as the regular season\r\nhad closed, and the magnificent spectacle and splendid music were\r\nhighly appreciated by the large audience, by none more than by a group\r\nof peasant women, who sat in one of the galleries with shawls over\r\ntheir heads, having walked fifty miles to attend the congress.\r\nProvision was made for their return home by train.\r\n\r\nThe formal organization for business took place Monday morning in the\r\nRedoute, a large, handsome convention hall, but hardly were the\r\npreliminaries over and luncheon finished when a long row of gaily\r\ndecorated carriages was ready for a three hour drive around the\r\nbeautiful city and its environs. At 7:30 the municipality gave an open\r\nair fête on Fisher Bastion, that noble piece of architecture which is\r\nthe pride of Budapest. A writer describing the procession of officers\r\nand delegates, headed by Mrs. Catt, passing up the steps to receive\r\nthe greetings of the city's high officials, said: \"The entrance up the\r\nwide steps, between lines of attendants in picturesque uniforms, with\r\nthe soft sunset glow and the lights coming out one by one in the city\r\nand on the river below, was like passing from real life into a land of\r\nenchantment.\" After the reception all assembled in the Court of Honor,\r\nwhere sparkling five-minute speeches were made by representatives from\r\na dozen countries.\r\n\r\nIt was soon evident that the business of the convention would have to\r\nbe confined to the morning hours, as the afternoons and evenings had\r\nto be given over to public speech making and social functions. There\r\nwas long discussion in several sessions on establishing international\r\nheadquarters and a press bureau, enlarging the monthly paper, _Jus\r\nSuffragii_, and changing the place of its publication. After most of\r\nthe delegates had expressed opinions the whole matter was left to the\r\nboard of officers. Miss Martina Kramers, Netherlands, declined to\r\nstand for re-election to the office of recording secretary and the\r\neditorship of the paper and a standing vote of thanks was given \"for\r\nher seven years' hard work, with the hope that her name will never be\r\nforgotten in the International Suffrage Alliance and that she will\r\nalways be appreciated as the founder of _Jus Suffragii_.[225] Miss\r\nChrystal Macmillan, Mrs. Marie Stritt and Mme. Marie Verone reported\r\nthat the book Woman Suffrage in Practice, which they had been\r\nrequested at the Stockholm meeting to prepare, was finished and the\r\nEnglish edition ready for this convention; the French and German\r\neditions would be published in a few weeks.\r\n\r\nThe treasurer, Mrs. Stanton Coit, made a detailed and acceptable\r\nreport and said that, with new headquarters, a paid secretary, an\r\nenlarged newspaper and many publications, 2,000 pounds would be\r\nnecessary for the next two years. Pledges were made for 2,510 pounds\r\n($12,350)[226].\r\n\r\nMrs. Catt having served as president nine years earnestly desired to\r\nretire in favor of a woman from another country but at a meeting of\r\nthe presidents of all the auxiliaries she was unanimously and strongly\r\nurged to reconsider her wish. She reluctantly did so and was elected\r\nby acclamation. The delegates decided that the ten persons receiving\r\nthe highest number of votes should constitute the officers of the\r\nAlliance and the board itself should apportion their special offices.\r\nMrs. Fawcett, Mrs. Coit, Miss Furuhjelm, Miss Bergman and Mrs.\r\nLindemann were re-elected. The five new officers selected were Mrs.\r\nDeWitt Schlumberger, France; Miss Schwimmer, Hungary; Miss Macmillan,\r\nGreat Britain; Mrs. Stritt, Germany; Mrs. Katharine Dexter McCormick,\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe persistent requests that the Board should and should not endorse\r\nthe \"militant\" movement in Great Britain, which had assumed serious\r\nproportions, caused it to recommend the following resolution which\r\nwas adopted without dissent: \"Resolved: That as the International\r\nWoman Suffrage Alliance stands pledged by its constitution to strict\r\nneutrality on all questions concerning national policy or tactics, its\r\nrules forbid any expression favoring or condemning 'militant' methods.\r\nBe it further resolved: That since riot, revolution and disorder have\r\nnever been construed into an argument against man suffrage, we protest\r\nagainst the practice of the opponents of woman suffrage to interpret\r\n'militancy' employed by the minority in one country as an excuse for\r\nwithholding the vote from the women of the world.\" At another time\r\nMrs. Cobden Sanderson of Great Britain, speaking as a fraternal\r\ndelegate, eulogized the self-sacrifice of the \"militants\" as the\r\nprincipal factor in the movement, and Mrs. Catt, speaking from the\r\nchair, said that she would like to answer the assertion that it was\r\nonly the \"militant\" women who were the martyrs. To the women who had\r\nmade such protests had come the glory, whereas there were thousands\r\nwho had given their lives to the cause whose names had never been\r\nheard. All down the centuries there had been heroines and martyrs and\r\nmany of them had stood alone. She believed the movement owed a great\r\ndebt to the \"militant\" women of Great Britain but they were only a\r\npart of it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Catt introduced and urged a resolution \"to send from this\r\ncongress a request to the Governments of all countries here\r\nrepresented to institute an international inquiry into the cause and\r\nextent of commercialized vice, and to ask the woman suffrage\r\norganizations in each country to petition their own Government to\r\ninstitute a national inquiry and to include women in the Commission.\"\r\nThe resolution was unanimously adopted. Mrs. Catt was appointed to\r\nrepresent the Alliance at the approaching International White Slave\r\nTraffic Congress in London. A very able address, showing a thorough\r\nstudy of the question, was made by Mrs. Fawcett, who presided at the\r\nmeeting held to discuss What Women Voters Have Done towards the\r\nSolution of this Problem.\r\n\r\nThe usual important reports of the progress in all the affiliated\r\ncountries were presented and ordered published in the Minutes, where\r\nthey filled over sixty pages. Miss Schwimmer in reporting for Hungary\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     At the time of the founding of the International Woman Suffrage\r\n     Alliance there was nothing even approaching a feminist movement\r\n     in Hungary, yet the recent Reform Bill which has just passed the\r\n     two Houses includes a long and thorough explanation of the\r\n     usefulness and need of woman suffrage and apologies on the part\r\n     of the Government for not being able (owing to the present\r\n     precarious political situation) to grant it. The marked\r\n     inclination of the Government in favor of woman suffrage and the\r\n     discussion which took place in the House afterwards, together\r\n     with the fact that an amendment to include woman suffrage\r\n     received more votes than any other moved, has given the whole\r\n     question such an importance that it is no longer a matter of\r\n     discussion as to whether our claims are justified or not, but\r\n     only when shall they be granted?\r\n\r\n     The work accomplished by us since the Stockholm Congress has been\r\n     in the main, as before, educational; propaganda by meetings,\r\n     lectures at all seasons and in all places; the distribution of an\r\n     immense quantity of leaflets and other printed matter and\r\n     lectures by famous foreign suffragists. The most valuable and\r\n     effective part of our work was that we took advantage of the\r\n     meetings arranged by the coalition opposition parties, which\r\n     include the Social Democratic and the Bourgeois-Radicals. They\r\n     held hundreds in all parts of Hungary, many attended by six or\r\n     eight thousand people, and in one in Budapest gathered an\r\n     audience of 15,000. We tried to get a speaker of ours on every\r\n     program. In spite of the militant opposition of the Social\r\n     Democratic party and Radical leaders, we succeeded nearly every\r\n     time in getting the floor, where we presented amendments to their\r\n     resolutions, which, when the chairman was honest enough to put\r\n     them to be voted on, were always enthusiastically carried....\r\n     About sixty societies for various purposes have declared their\r\n     position by taking part officially in several of our public\r\n     demonstrations.\r\n\r\nA list was given of distinguished men who had become converted to\r\nwoman suffrage. Men took a more prominent part in this convention than\r\nin any which had preceded, due principally to the very active\r\nHungarian Men's League for Woman Suffrage, which included a number\r\nwell known in political and intellectual life. The International\r\nAlliance of Men's Leagues conducted an afternoon session in the Pester\r\nLloyd hall with the Hon. Georg de Lukacs of Hungary, its president, in\r\nthe chair. What can Men Do to Help the Movement for Woman Suffrage?\r\nwas discussed by Dr. C. V. Drysdale, Great Britain; Major C. V.\r\nMansfeldt, Netherlands, and Dr. Andre de Maday, Hungary. On Thursday\r\nevening this International League held a mass meeting in the Academy\r\nof Music with rousing speeches for woman suffrage by Hermann Bahr,\r\nAustria; M. Du Breuil de St. Germain, France; Major Mansfeldt; Keir\r\nHardie, Great Britain; Senator Mechelin, Finland; Dr. Vazsonyi, M. P.,\r\nHungary; Professor Wicksell, Sweden; Professor Gustav Szaszy-Schwartz,\r\nHungary.\r\n\r\nA crowded mass meeting addressed by women took place one evening in\r\nthe Academy of Music, with Mrs. Catt presiding. Mrs. Stritt, president\r\nof the National Suffrage Association of Germany, spoke on Woman\r\nSuffrage and Eugenics; Mme. Maria Verone, a well known lawyer of\r\nParis, made her impassioned address in French, and Dr. Gulli Petrini\r\nof Sweden spoke in French on Woman Suffrage and Democracy; Miss\r\nSchwimmer inspired the audience with Hungarian oratory; Miss Jane\r\nAddams of the United States gave a forceful address on Why the Modern\r\nWoman Needs the Ballot, and Dr. Shaw closed the meeting with an\r\neloquent interpretation of the demand of women for the vote. One\r\nafternoon from 4 to 6 o'clock was devoted to a Young People's Meeting,\r\naddressed by delegates from eight countries. A forenoon was given to\r\nthe discussion of the always vital question, What Relation Should\r\nSuffrage Organizations Bear toward Political Parties, led by Mrs. Anna\r\nB. Wicksell, Sweden, and Miss Courtney, Great Britain. A large\r\naudience heard one evening the Benefits of Woman Suffrage related by\r\nthose who had been sent as official delegates from Governments that\r\nhad given the vote to women, Mrs. Qvam, Miss Krog and Mrs. Spencer,\r\nand in supplementary speeches by Mrs. Jenny Forselius, member of\r\nParliament from Finland; Miss A. Maude Royden, Great Britain; Mrs.\r\nCharlotte Perkins Gilman, United States, whose topic was New Mothers\r\nof a New World. A resumé of all these addresses was made in Hungarian\r\nby Vilma Glücklich. During the convention much of the interpreting in\r\nEnglish, French and German was done by Mrs. Maud Nathan of the United\r\nStates, who also made an address in the three languages.\r\n\r\nOn the last day it seemed almost as if the men had taken possession of\r\nthe congress, for they had secured the convention hall for the\r\nafternoon meeting, but the women did not like to discourage such\r\nexceptional interest. Woman Suffrage and Men's Economic, Ethical and\r\nPolitical Interest in it was discussed by Professor Emanuel Beke,\r\nHungary; Dr. Emil von Hoffmansthal, Austria; Frederick Nathan and\r\nRabbi Stephen S. Wise, United States. Vigorous speeches were made by\r\nMalcolm Mitchell, Great Britain; Leo Gassman, Germany; the Rev. Benno\r\nHaypal, and Alexander Patay, Hungary. The hall was restored to the\r\nwomen at 5 o'clock for their final program under the general topic,\r\nHow may women still bound by ancient custom, tradition and prejudice\r\nbe awakened to a realization that these new times demand new duties\r\nand responsibilities? How to Reach the Home Woman, Mrs. Gisela Urban,\r\nAustria; Mrs. Irma V. Szirmay, Mrs. von Fürth, Hungary; How to Reach\r\nthe Church Woman, Mme. Jane Brigode, Belgium, Mme. Girardet-Vielle,\r\nSwitzerland; How to Reach the Society Woman, Miss Royden, Mme.\r\nSchlumberger; How to Reach the Woman of Higher Education, Mrs. Crystal\r\nEastman Benedict, United States; How to Reach the Wage-earning Woman,\r\nMiss Isabella O. Ford, Mrs. Clinny Dryer, Great Britain; How to Reach\r\nthe Woman Social Worker, Miss Addams.\r\n\r\nAt the last business session the convention placed on record its\r\nappreciation of the unsurpassed hospitality shown by the Hungarians.\r\nThe delegates from this country expressed the pleasure it had been to\r\nwelcome the women of all nations and the inspiration that had been\r\nreceived. The president, Mrs. Catt, asked them to part with the\r\nintention of coming to the next conference, each with a victory in her\r\nown country to celebrate.\r\n\r\nThere were many luncheons, teas and dinners in beautiful private\r\nhomes. The social entertainment which will be longest remembered was\r\nthe evening trip down the Danube with supper and music on board, a\r\nhappy, congenial party with three hours of the exquisite scenery along\r\nthe shores. Usually suffrage conventions closed in a burst of oratory\r\nat a grand mass meeting but not so in this pleasure loving Hungarian\r\ncity. The last evening was given over to a banquet which taxed the\r\ncapacity of the big convention hall. There were toasts and speeches\r\nand patriotic songs, and the presentation of the international pin,\r\nset with jewels, by the ladies of Budapest to Miss Schwimmer. She said\r\nin a clever acceptance that the women had done what the men never had\r\nsucceeded in doing; it was the desire of all Hungarians to make this\r\ncity the resort of the world and the women of the world had been the\r\nfirst to come. \"These ambassadors,\" she said, \"who came, to quote the\r\nwords of Mazzini, 'in the name of God and humanity,' will report to\r\ntheir countries the friendly reception they have met and will surely\r\nhelp the cause of international good feeling.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral countries competed for the honor of the conference of the\r\nAlliance in 1915 and its regular convention in 1917. Mrs. May Wright\r\nSewall, honorary president of the International Council of Women,\r\npresented an official invitation from the managers of the Panama\r\nPacific Exposition to be held in San Francisco in 1915, endorsed by\r\nthe California Suffrage Association; the executive committee of the\r\nNational Suffrage Association of Germany extended an urgent request\r\nfor the conference and that of France for the congress. The answer was\r\nreferred to the board, and it later accepted the invitations to Berlin\r\nand Paris. This had been the largest meeting of the Alliance. Never\r\nhad the prospects seemed so favorable for accomplishing its objects;\r\nnever had the fraternity among the women of the different nations\r\nseemed so close. When they parted with affectionate farewells and the\r\nbright hope of meeting two years hence in Berlin they little dreamed\r\nthat it would be seven long years before they came together again;\r\nthat during this time the world would be devastated by the most\r\nterrible war in history and that the task must be once more commenced\r\nof developing among the women of the nations the spirit of confidence,\r\nfriendship and cooperation.\r\n\r\n\r\nEIGHTH CONFERENCE OF THE ALLIANCE.\r\n\r\nOn call of its president, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt of the United\r\nStates of America, the International Woman Suffrage Alliance was\r\nsummoned to its Eighth congress June 6-12, 1920, in Geneva,\r\nSwitzerland, seven instead of the usual two years after the last one.\r\nThe reason for the long interim was given in the opening sentences of\r\nthe president's address on the first day: \"It is seven years since\r\nlast we met. In memory we live again those happy days of friendly\r\ncamaraderie in Budapest. All the faces were cheerful. On every side\r\none heard joyous laughter among the delegates and visitors. Every\r\nheart was filled with buoyant hopes and every soul was armored with\r\ndauntless courage. We had seen our numbers grow greater and our\r\nmovement stronger in many lands and here and there the final triumph\r\nhad already come.... Alas, those smiling, shining days seem now to\r\nhave been an experience in some other incarnation, for the years which\r\nlie between are war-scarred and tortured and in 1920 there is not a\r\nhuman being in the world to whom life is quite the same as in 1913....\r\nSo we do not come smiling to Geneva as to Budapest.\"\r\n\r\nOn Sunday morning, June 6, for the first time in the history of Geneva\r\na woman spoke in the National Church, the Cathedral of St. Peter, and\r\nstanding in the pulpit of Calvin Miss A. Maude Royden of Great Britain\r\npreached in French and English to an audience that filled the ancient\r\nedifice to the doors. That morning at 9 o'clock Father Hall, sent by\r\nthe Catholic ecclesiastical authorities from England for the purpose,\r\ndelivered a sermon to the congress at a special mass in Notre\r\nDame.[227] In the afternoon a reception was given by Mlle. Emilie\r\nGourd, president of the Swiss National Suffrage Association, in the\r\nlovely garden, Beau Sejour. At a public meeting in the evening at\r\nPlainpalais, M. J. Mussard, president of the Canton of Geneva; Mme.\r\nChaponnière Chaix, president of the Swiss National Council of Women,\r\nand Mlle. Gourd gave addresses of welcome, to which responses were\r\nmade by Miss Annie Furuhjelm, Finland; Mme. De Witt Schlumberger,\r\nFrance, and Mrs. Anna Lindemann, Germany, officers of the Alliance.\r\nMrs. Catt then delivered her president's address. She described the\r\nphysical, mental and moral chaos resulting from the war, the immense\r\nproblems now to be solved, and said: \"For the suffragists of the world\r\na few facts stand forth with great clarity. The first is that war, the\r\nundoubted original cause of the age-old subjection of women the world\r\naround; war, the combined enemy of their emancipation, has brought to\r\nthe women of many lands their political freedom!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Catt showed how the suffrage had come in some countries where no\r\neffort had been made for it, while in others where women had worked\r\nthe hardest they were still disfranchised, and she gave a scathing\r\nreview of the situation in the United States, where it had been so\r\nlong withheld. She paid eloquent tributes to Susan B. Anthony, a\r\nfounder of the Alliance, and to Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, who had helped\r\nto found it and had attended every congress but had died the preceding\r\nyear. She pointed out to the enfranchised delegates the great\r\nresponsibility that had been placed in their hands and through it the\r\nvast power they would have in re-creating the world and said: \"I\r\nbelieve had the vote been granted to women twenty-five years ago,\r\ntheir national influence would have so leavened world politics that\r\nthere would have been no world war.\" Among the many objects for the\r\nAlliance to accomplish she named the following: (1) Stimulate the\r\nspread of democracy and through it avoid another world war; (2)\r\nDiscourage revolution by demonstrating that change may be brought\r\nabout through peaceful political methods; (3) Encourage education and\r\nenlightenment throughout the world; (4) Keep the faith in\r\nself-government alive when it fails to meet expectations. Methods for\r\nachieving these results were suggested and it was impressed on the\r\nyounger women that this would be their task, as the older ones had\r\npractically finished their work. This address of surpassing eloquence\r\nclosed with these words:\r\n\r\n     God's order will come again to the world's stricken, unhappy,\r\n     much-suffering people. It will come because the divine law of\r\n     evolution never ceases to operate and the destiny of the race\r\n     leads eternally on without pause. So much sacrifice and sorrow as\r\n     the war has cost the world can not have been endured in vain....\r\n     As I view world politics the only possible hope for the\r\n     happiness, prosperity and permanent peace of the world lies in\r\n     the thorough democratization of all governments. There can be no\r\n     democratization which excludes women and no safe or sound\r\n     democracy which is not based upon an educated, intelligent\r\n     electorate. Nor is it enough to establish democracy in individual\r\n     nations--it must be extended to world politics. The old\r\n     militarism must go and with it the old diplomacy, with its secret\r\n     treaties, distrust and intrigues. No League of Nations can\r\n     abolish war unless every government in the world is based on\r\n     democracy.\r\n\r\n     In our home countries we should urge support of every movement\r\n     for the extension of popular education, foster every agency which\r\n     helps men and women to think for themselves, promote every\r\n     endeavor to maintain honest elections, judicially conducted\r\n     campaigns and high ideals in parties and parliaments, for\r\n     democracy succeeds when and where independence and intelligence\r\n     are greatest.\r\n\r\nA few of the delegates wished to disband the Alliance; a few others\r\ndesired to change the character of its objects, but by an overwhelming\r\nmajority it was voted to continue it along the original lines,\r\nalthough broadened, until the women of all countries were\r\nenfranchised. The Congress was held in the Maison Communale de\r\nPlainpalais, the large town hall in a suburb of Geneva, and here one\r\nevening its municipality gave a reception to the members. The shady\r\ngardens and sunny terrace were the scene of many social\r\ngatherings.[228] The congress opened with a roll call of the suffrage\r\nvictories and the responses showed the almost unbelievable record that\r\ntwenty countries had enfranchised their women during the years of the\r\nwar! The Official Report was edited by Miss Chrystal Macmillan,\r\nrecording secretary of the International Alliance, and the\r\nIntroduction was a graphic review, which said in part:\r\n\r\n\"Despite the difficulties of travel and the fact that only three\r\nmonths' notice had been given the gathering at Geneva was more widely\r\nrepresentative than any previous meeting. Women were present from\r\nthirty-six countries. Of the twenty-six affiliated with the Alliance\r\nat the time of the last meeting, in 1913, the auxiliaries of nineteen\r\nshowed their continued vitality by sending fully accredited delegates\r\nto Geneva. Representatives were also present from the former\r\nauxiliaries in Austria and Germany, who were accorded full membership\r\nrights. The Russian national president, a fugitive from her country,\r\nwas unable to come but sent her greetings. The Belgian society\r\nabstained from taking part and from the Polish and Portuguese\r\nauxiliaries no answer was received.\r\n\r\n\"Four countries, Greece, Spain, Argentina and Uruguay, sent delegates\r\nfrom newly formed National Suffrage Societies, which were accepted in\r\nthe Alliance. In addition there were present women from Armenia, the\r\nCrimea, Lettonia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, New Zealand, Poland, Turkey\r\nand Ukrainia. For the first time women from India and Japan came to\r\ntell of the beginnings of the organized movement among the women of\r\nthe East. It was only the difficulties of travel which prevented the\r\ndelegates who had started on their journeys from China, Egypt and\r\nPalestine from arriving in time for the congress. For the first time\r\nmore than half the voting delegates represented countries in which\r\nwomen had the full suffrage. The consequent increased political\r\nimportance of the congress was recognized by the governments of the\r\nworld, of which eighteen in Europe appointed official representatives,\r\nand the United States of America and Uruguay of South America. The\r\nSecretariat of the League of Nations also sent a representative....\r\n\r\n\"The outstanding feature of the first business session was the\r\nannouncement of particulars by representatives of the many nations\r\nwhich had given the political and suffrage and eligibility to women\r\nbetween 1913 and 1920--Austria, British East Africa, Canada, Crimea,\r\nCzecho-Slovakia, Denmark, Esthonia, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary,\r\nIceland, Lettonia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Poland,\r\nRhodesia, Russia, Sweden, Ukrainia and six more of the United States.\r\nIt was announced that women sit as members of Parliament in the\r\nmajority of these countries, while large numbers are members of\r\nmunicipal councils. In the United States of America the Federal\r\nSuffrage Amendment had passed both Houses of Congress and had been\r\nratified by thirty-five of the necessary thirty-six States. Serbia,\r\nBelgium and Roumania had granted Municipal suffrage to women and the\r\nZionists of Palestine and the Commune of Fiume had given to them full\r\nequal suffrage and eligibility.... It was decided to arrange at the\r\nnext congress a session at which only enfranchised women should\r\nspeak.... The Catholic Woman Suffrage Society of Great Britain was\r\naccepted as a member of the Alliance....\r\n\r\n\"Each of the three evening meetings, besides that of Sunday, which\r\nwere all crowded and enthusiastic, was characteristic of a different\r\naspect of the present development of the suffrage movement. On Monday,\r\na special feature was the speeches of five women members of\r\nParliament--Helen Ring Robinson (State Senate), Colorado; Elna Münch,\r\nDenmark; Annie Furuhjelm, Finland; Lady Astor, Great Britain; Tekla\r\nKauffman, Wurtemberg. In all, nine women members of Parliament\r\nattended the Congress. The others, who spoke at later meetings, were\r\nFrau Burian and Adelheid Popp of Austria; Mme. Petkavetchaite of\r\nLithuania and Adele Schrieber-Krieger, whose election to the German\r\nReichstag was announced during the Congress. On Wednesday at the great\r\nmeeting in the Hall of the Reformation, three-minute speeches were\r\ngiven by representatives of each of the enfranchised countries in the\r\nAlliance. Yet another new aspect was illustrated by the meeting of\r\nThursday, addressed by women from India and China. The speeches showed\r\nhow similar are the difficulties of the women of both the East and the\r\nWest and how much new ground has still to be broken before the object\r\nof the Alliance is achieved.\"\r\n\r\nThe forenoons were devoted to business meetings relating to the future\r\nwork of the Alliance and they were in session simultaneously in\r\ndifferent rooms in the great building--Women and Party Politics, Legal\r\nStatus of Women, Civil Equality, Economic Value of Domestic Work of\r\nWives and Mothers, Equal Pay for Equal Work, Single Moral Standard,\r\nProtection of Childhood--questions affecting the welfare of all\r\nsociety in all lands, pressing for solution and in all practically the\r\nsame. The afternoons were given largely to the reports from many\r\ncountries.[229] _The Woman's Leader_, organ of the National Union of\r\nSocieties for Equal Citizenship of Great Britain, in its account of\r\nthe Congress said:\r\n\r\n     The effect of these reports was intensely dramatic, mingled, as\r\n     it inevitably was, with the memories of the strange and bitter\r\n     conditions under which the change had come. In some of the\r\n     countries that had been at war enfranchisement came in the midst\r\n     of revolution, riot and disaster; in others it came fresh and new\r\n     with the beginning of their independent national life and almost\r\n     as a matter of course. \"Our men and women struggled together for\r\n     our national freedom,\" said delegate after delegate from the new\r\n     States of Europe, \"and so when any of us were enfranchised we\r\n     both were.\" The report on the election of women to national or\r\n     municipal bodies was deeply interesting and in many respects\r\n     surprising. Germany easily surpassed other countries in this\r\n     respect, having had 39 women members in the last National\r\n     Assembly, 155 in the Parliaments of the Federated States and\r\n     4,000 on local and municipal bodies. In Denmark the record of\r\n     success that followed the election of women was astonishing. \"We\r\n     have done,\" said the spokeswoman, \"what we set out to do; we have\r\n     introduced equal pay and equal marriage laws; our equality is a\r\n     fact.\"\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, president of the Alliance, welcomed\r\n     each new representative in the name of all the countries, and,\r\n     although the victories had been won in times of stress and war,\r\n     the rejoicing was without rivalry, for in the Congress from the\r\n     first day until the last no sign or mark of ill-feeling or enmity\r\n     was to be found. Not that the delegates forgot or disregarded the\r\n     recent existence of the war; no one who saw them would suppose\r\n     for a moment that they were meeting in any blind or sentimental\r\n     paradise of fools. Their differences and their nations'\r\n     differences were plain in their minds and they neither forgot nor\r\n     wished to forget the ruined areas, the starving children and the\r\n     suffering peoples of the world. They met differing perhaps\r\n     profoundly in their national sentiment, their memories and their\r\n     judgments but determined to agree where agreement was to be\r\n     found; to understand where understanding could be arrived at and\r\n     to cooperate with the very best of their will and their\r\n     intelligence in assuring the future stability of the world.\r\n\r\nAn important report was that of the Headquarters Committee, consisting\r\nof Mrs. Catt, Mrs. Millicent Garrett Fawcett, first vice-president of\r\nthe Alliance, Mrs. Adela Stanton Coit, treasurer, and Miss Macmillan.\r\nMrs. Coit was chairman the first two years and Mrs. Fawcett the rest\r\nof the time. After the Congress at Budapest in 1913 the official\r\nmonthly paper _Jus Suffragii_ was removed from Rotterdam to London and\r\nthe international headquarters established there. For the next seven\r\nyears the three members of the committee resident in London held\r\nregular meetings, seventy altogether, consulting Mrs. Catt by letter\r\nor cable when necessary. Miss Mary Sheepshanks was editor and\r\nheadquarters secretary. \"She occupied that post with great acceptance\r\ntill 1919,\" said the report, \"when it was with much regret that her\r\nresignation was accepted. Mrs. Elizabeth Abbott was appointed to the\r\nplace, where in connection with the preparations for the present\r\nCongress her organizing capacity has been of special value.\" Miss\r\nRosika Schwimmer of Hungary was appointed press secretary to furnish\r\nthe news to the international press but her work had hardly begun\r\nwhen the war broke out and she resigned the position to take up work\r\nfor peace.\r\n\r\nThe report told of the meeting of the international officers and a\r\nnumber of the national presidents which took place in London in July,\r\n1914, to make arrangements for the Congress in Berlin the next year.\r\nAmong the many social receptions given were one in the House of\r\nCommons and one at the home of former Prime Minister Balfour. Mrs.\r\nCatt had just started on her homeward voyage when the war began. The\r\nofficers in London at once issued a Manifesto in the name of the\r\nAlliance and presented it to the British Foreign Office and the\r\nAmbassadors and Ministers in London, which after pointing out the\r\nhelplessness of women in this supreme hour said: \"We women of\r\ntwenty-six countries, having banded ourselves together in the\r\nInternational Woman Suffrage Alliance with the object of obtaining the\r\npolitical means of sharing with men the power which shapes the fate of\r\nnations, appeal to you to leave untried no method of conciliation or\r\narbitration for arranging international differences which may help to\r\navert deluging half the civilized world in blood.\" They decided to\r\ncooperate with the British branch of the Alliance in a public meeting,\r\nwhich was held August 3 with Mrs. Fawcett in the chair, and a\r\nresolution similar to the above was adopted. In the next issue of the\r\n_International News_, when war had been declared, Mrs. Fawcett in her\r\nofficial capacity wrote:\r\n\r\n     We are faced by the disruption, the animosity, the\r\n     misunderstanding caused by war but notwithstanding the cruel\r\n     strain we must firmly resolve to hold our International Alliance\r\n     together. We must believe all through that good is stronger than\r\n     evil, that justice and mercy are stronger than hatred and\r\n     destruction, just as life is stronger than death. We women who\r\n     have worked together for a great cause have hopes and ideals in\r\n     common; these are indestructible links binding us together. We\r\n     have to show that what unites us is stronger than what separates\r\n     us. Between many of us there is also the further link of personal\r\n     friendship cemented by many years of work together. We must hold\r\n     on through all difficulties to these things which are good in\r\n     themselves and must therefore be a strong help to us all through\r\n     these days of trial.\r\n\r\n\"In this spirit the Headquarters Committee has endeavored to carry out\r\nits task,\" said its report, \"and it has so far succeeded that it is\r\nin a position today to lay down its work without any society having\r\nbeen lost to the Alliance and with a considerable group of countries\r\nnever before associated with it now seeking affiliation.\" The great\r\ndifficulty of getting the paper into the various countries was\r\ndescribed but it was accomplished; the paper never missed an issue; it\r\nremained absolutely neutral and the number of subscribers largely\r\nincreased. It was the one medium through which the women of the\r\nwarring nations came in touch during the four and a half years of the\r\nconflict. All through the war it had news of some kind from the\r\nvarious countries showing that their women were still engaged in\r\norganized work for many useful purposes. It was evident that in\r\npractically all of them they were demanding that women should have a\r\nvoice in the government.\r\n\r\nThe headquarters cooperated with other international organizations in\r\nforming the International Woman's Relief Committee and the work was\r\nconducted in its rooms. More than a thousand foreign girls were sent\r\nor taken to their countries and hundreds of British, French and\r\nBelgian women brought from Germany and Belgium to London. The work\r\namong Belgian refugees would require many pages to describe.\r\n\r\nMrs. Fawcett and Mrs. Catt were preparing to send a deputation from\r\nthe Alliance to the Peace Conference to ask for a declaration for\r\nwoman suffrage when the National Woman Suffrage Association of France,\r\nthrough its president, Mme. DeWitt Schlumberger, took the initiative\r\nand called for the national associations of the allied countries to\r\nsend representatives to Paris to bring pressure on it. They were\r\ncordially received by the members of the Conference and a\r\npronouncement in favor of the political equality of women and\r\neligibility to the secretariat was placed in the constitution of the\r\nLeague of Nations, which attracted the attention of the world.\r\n\r\nWhen the plan of holding the Congress of the Alliance at Berlin in\r\n1915 had to be given up Holland sent an urgent invitation for that\r\nyear but its acceptance was not considered feasible. The Swedish\r\nAuxiliary wanted it held at the time and place of the Peace Conference\r\nbut this was found to be inadvisable. The majority of the officers and\r\nauxiliaries in the various countries wished to have a congress the\r\nnext spring after the Armistice but there proved to be insurmountable\r\nobstacles. Toward the end of 1919 an invitation was accepted from the\r\nsuffrage societies in Spain to come to Madrid in 1920. Preparations\r\nwere under way when local opposition developed which made it necessary\r\nto abandon the plan. Switzerland had already invited the congress and\r\nit gladly went to Geneva.\r\n\r\nIn the report of Mrs. Coit, the treasurer, she said:\r\n\r\n     You will remember that at Budapest in 1913 a sum of about 2,000\r\n     pounds was raised, mostly by promises of yearly donations for the\r\n     period of two years. This sum was to finance headquarters and the\r\n     paper till we met in Berlin in 1915. In August, 1914, not even\r\n     all the first instalments had been received, and from then on,\r\n     owing to war conditions, it became impossible for some of our\r\n     biggest donors to redeem their pledges. By the beginning of 1917\r\n     we found ourselves with an empty exchequer and facing the\r\n     possibility of closing down our work. It was then that help came\r\n     from our auxiliary in the United States. Mrs. Catt, with the help\r\n     of her many devoted friends, raised a sum of $4,333, which was\r\n     placed at our disposal and has enabled the Alliance to keep\r\n     going. When speaking of the United States' help I wish to make\r\n     special mention of the splendid work for the Alliance by Miss\r\n     Clara M. Hyde, private secretary for Mrs. Catt. To her incessant\r\n     interest and energy it is due that the number of honorary\r\n     associates in the U. S. A. now is at least three times as high as\r\n     in any other country; also she has quite trebled the number of\r\n     subscribers to the _International News_ in the States. Her\r\n     devoted work is an example of what can be done by a single\r\n     national auxiliary to further the development of the Alliance,\r\n     and I recommend her example for universal imitation.\r\n\r\nThe United States Auxiliary continued to add to the above sum and from\r\nMay, 1916, to May, 1920, it sent in membership dues, subscriptions to\r\nthe paper and donations $9,337. Mrs. Frank M. Roessing, president of\r\nthe Pennsylvania Suffrage Association, was responsible for collecting\r\nover $5,000 of this amount.\r\n\r\nThe money for the Congress in Geneva, about $3,500, was raised by a\r\nBritish committee of which Miss Rosamond Smith was chairman and Mrs.\r\nPethick Lawrence treasurer. To this fund the United States, which had\r\nnot suffered from the war to the extent of European countries, was a\r\nlarge contributor. At the close of the congress there were no funds on\r\nhand for the coming year and the delegates from all countries were\r\nfeeling the effects of the war financially. At this critical moment\r\nMrs. Katharine Dexter McCormick of the United States, corresponding\r\nsecretary of the Alliance, made a contribution of $5,000, and a little\r\nlater the Leslie Commission added $4,000. This with individual\r\nsubscriptions raised the amount of about $15,000 and guaranteed the\r\nexpenses for resuming and continuing the work of the Alliance.\r\n\r\nFrom the organization of the Alliance in Berlin in 1904 Mrs. Catt had\r\nbeen the president and at no election had there been another\r\ncandidate. Her strong desire to relinquish the office was overruled at\r\nBudapest. She went to Geneva with the positive determination not to\r\naccept it again but she faced an equally determined body of delegates.\r\nNot only was she supported by all from the Allied Countries, as they\r\nwere known during the war, but she was equally acceptable to those\r\nfrom the Central Countries. She was literally compelled to retain the\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nNominations for the other officers were made by ballot and submitted\r\nto the convention and the ten receiving the highest number of votes\r\nconstituted the board. They were as follows: Mme. DeWitt Schlumberger\r\n(France), Miss Chrystal Macmillan (Great Britain), Mrs. Anna B.\r\nWicksell (Sweden), Mrs. Corbett Ashby (Great Britain), Dr. Margherita\r\nAncona (Italy), Mrs. Anna Lindemann (Germany), Miss Eleanor Rathbone\r\n(Great Britain), Mrs. Katharine Dexter McCormick (U. S. A.), Mme.\r\nGirardet-Vielle (Switzerland), Mrs. Adele Schreiber-Krieger (Germany).\r\nMost of them were officers of the National Association in their own\r\ncountries. Miss Rathbone was also a member of the city council of\r\nLiverpool.\r\n\r\nAmong the twenty-two sent as Government delegates were Viscountess\r\nAstor, member of the British House of Commons; Mrs. Marie Stritt, city\r\ncouncillor of Dresden, and Mrs. Josephus Daniels, wife of the\r\nSecretary of the Navy, U. S. A. Invited members were present from nine\r\ncountries, including ten from India, one from Japan and the wife of\r\nthe Tartar president of the Parliament of Crimea. There were fraternal\r\ndelegates from six international associations; from associations in\r\nnearly every country in Europe (fourteen in Great Britain) and from\r\nSouth Africa, Australia, Argentina and Uruguay. Greetings were sent\r\nfrom associations in many countries including China.\r\n\r\nA number of the resolutions adopted have been foreshadowed in this\r\nreport of the proceedings. Others were for the equal status of women\r\nwith men on legislative and administrative bodies; full personal and\r\ncivil rights for married women, including the right to their earnings\r\nand property; equal guardianship of their children by mothers; that\r\nthe children of widows without provisions shall have the right to\r\nmaintenance by the State paid to the mothers; that children born out\r\nof wedlock shall have the same right to maintenance and education from\r\nthe father as legitimate children, and the mother the right of\r\nmaintenance while incapacitated. Resolutions called for the same\r\nopportunities for women as for men for all kinds of education and\r\ntraining and for entering professions, industries, civil service\r\npositions and performing administrative and judicial functions, and\r\ndemanded that there shall be equal pay for equal work; that the right\r\nto work of women, married or unmarried, shall be recognized and that\r\nno special regulations shall be imposed contrary to the wishes of the\r\nwomen themselves. A higher moral standard for both men and women was\r\ncalled for and various resolutions were adopted against traffic in\r\nwomen, regulations of vice differentiating against women and State\r\nregulation of prostitution.\r\n\r\nThe Congress took a firm position on the League of Nations and its\r\nrecognition of women in the following resolution: \"The women of\r\nthirty-one nations assembled in congress at Geneva, convinced that in\r\na strong Society of Nations based on the principles of right and\r\njustice lies the only hope of assuring the future peace of the world,\r\ncall upon the women of the whole world to direct their will, their\r\nintelligence and their influence towards the development and the\r\nconsolidation of the Society of Nations on such a basis, and to assist\r\nit in every possible way in its work of securing peace and good will\r\nthroughout the world.\"\r\n\r\nA resolution was adopted that a conference of representative women be\r\nsummoned annually by the League of Nations for the purpose of\r\nconsidering questions relating to the welfare and status of women; the\r\nconference to be held at the seat of the League, if possible, and the\r\nexpenses paid by the League. The Board instructed Mrs. Ashby Corbett\r\nto arrange a deputation to the League of Nations to present\r\nresolutions and to ask for the calling of the conference as soon as\r\npossible.[230]\r\n\r\nOn the last day of the Congress from 5 to 7 o'clock the State Council\r\nof the Canton and the Municipal Council of Geneva gave an official\r\nreception and tea to the delegates and visitors. The resolutions of\r\nthanks for the assistance and courtesies received from committees and\r\nindividuals filled two printed pages. The _Woman's Leader_ thus closed\r\nits account: \"The immense hospitality of Geneva and of the Swiss\r\nConsulate, the superb weather and the beautiful excursions by land and\r\nlake were above all praise.... Taking the Conference as a whole, with\r\nits concrete work and its general spirit, it is clear that it marks a\r\nnew step forward. A new force has come into the politics of almost all\r\nthe world. It is a force inspired at present with good will, a\r\nhumanitarian and an internationalizing force, drawing together the\r\nthoughtful and disinterested women of all countries. It is a force\r\nthat the world has need of and no Government should be so blind as to\r\nignore it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[221] _History of Woman Suffrage_, Volume IV, page 124.\r\n\r\n[222] Delegates and alternates present besides those already mentioned\r\nwere Misses L. G. Heymann and Marta Zietz, Germany; Mrs. Stanton Coit,\r\nGreat Britain; Mrs. Henrietta von Loenen de Bordes, Mrs. Hengeveld\r\nGarritson, Miss C. C. A. Van Dorp, Netherlands; Mrs. Vibetha Salicath,\r\nMiss Eline Hansen, Mrs. Charlotte Eilersgaard, Miss Rasmussen,\r\nDenmark; Mrs. Anna B. Wicksell, Mrs. Frigga Carlberg, Miss Jenny\r\nWallerstedt, Sweden; Miss Fredrikke Mörek, Miss Marie Scharlenberg,\r\nNorway; Mrs. Saulner, Switzerland; Mrs. Henry Dobson, Australia; Miss\r\nRosika Schwimmer, Hungary; Mrs. Mary Wood Swift, Miss Belle Kearney,\r\nMrs. Ida Husted Harper, Miss Lucy E. Anthony, Miss Nettie Lovisa\r\nWhite, Mrs. Lydia Kingsmill Commander, United States.\r\n\r\n[223] The reports from the various countries prepared for this\r\ncongress filled fifty-seven pages of the printed report and fully\r\njustified Mrs. Catt's statement.\r\n\r\n[224] The committee which had been appointed to prepare for the\r\ncongress and had been working for many months beforehand consisted of\r\nthe Executive Committee of the central board of the National Suffrage\r\nAssociation and the presidents of sub-committees formed for different\r\npurposes. Miss Signe Bergman acted as president, Miss Axianne\r\nThorstenson as vice-president, Miss Anna Frisell as treasurer, Miss\r\nNini Kohnberger and Miss Elise Carlson as secretaries. Mrs. Virgin was\r\nat the head of the Finance Committee. The work of the Press Committee\r\nwas directed by Mrs. Else Kleen. Mrs. Lily Laurent was at the head of\r\nthe Committee on Localities. Mrs. Lizinski Dyrssen headed the\r\nCommittee for Festivities. Mrs. Ezaline Boheman was the head of the\r\nInformation Bureau. Miss Lamm and Miss Anden directed the work of the\r\nthirty university students who served as pages and whose kindness and\r\nswift and silent service none will ever forget. At the head of the\r\nTravelling Committee was Dr. Malin Wester-Halberg, who arranged the\r\njourney to Lapland, gave information about all excursions, etc.\r\n\r\n[225] International headquarters were established in London, the paper\r\nwas greatly enlarged and published there under the title, _Jus\r\nSuffragii, International Woman Suffrage News_, and Miss Mary\r\nSheepshanks was appointed editor, a post which she filled most\r\nsatisfactorily during the following six troubled years.\r\n\r\n[226] Because of the war which devastated Europe for the next five\r\nyears these pledges could not be kept and the Alliance did not meet\r\nagain until 1920. Meanwhile the United States contributed enough so\r\nthat the London headquarters were kept open and the paper did not miss\r\nan issue.\r\n\r\n[227] The English church of Geneva also for the first time admitted a\r\nwoman to its pulpit, which was occupied on the following Sunday, June\r\n13, by Miss Edith Picton Turberville of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[228] Among the many entertainments during the congress were a\r\nreception given by the British delegation; a motor excursion by\r\ninvitation of Mrs. McCormick and the American delegates; a dinner\r\nparty at Hotel Beau Rivage by Lady Astor for British and American\r\ndelegates; a delightful \"tea\" by the French delegation and a garden\r\nparty by M. and Mme. Thuillier-Landry. Excursions were arranged by the\r\nGeneva Committee and visits to the schools, museums, parks and endless\r\npoints of attraction in this most interesting city.\r\n\r\n[229] These valuable accounts of the status of women in the various\r\ncountries were published in full in the 252-page Report of the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n[230] They called on Sir Alec Drummond, head of the Secretariat, in\r\nLondon. He received them cordially but said it would be impossible for\r\nthe League to undertake such expenses and advised them to appoint a\r\ncommittee to act as a source of communication between the League and\r\nthe Alliance. Thenceforth the League recognized the Alliance as an\r\nauthority and accepted its recommendation to place Mrs. Anna B.\r\nWicksell on its Mandates Commission and Miss Henni Forchhammer on its\r\nWhite Slave Traffic Commission. These women had already been sent to\r\nthe League meetings by Sweden and Denmark as alternate delegates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nNEBRASKA MEN'S ASSOCIATION OPPOSED TO WOMAN SUFFRAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Electors of the State of Nebraska:\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of men lately held in the city of Omaha the following\r\nresolution was unanimously adopted: \"Resolved, That it is the sense of\r\nthis meeting that a Manifesto be prepared, issued and circulated,\r\nsetting forth the reasons for our opposition to the pending\r\nconstitutional amendment providing for equal (woman) suffrage and\r\nrequesting the cooperation of the voters of the State, and that such\r\nManifesto be signed by all the men present.\"\r\n\r\nWe yield to none in our admiration, veneration and respect for woman.\r\nWe recognize in her admirable and adorable qualities and sweet and\r\nnoble influences which make for the betterment of mankind and the\r\nadvancement of civilization. We have ever been willing and ready to\r\ngrant to woman every right and protection, even to favoritism in the\r\nlaw, and to give her every opportunity that makes for development and\r\ntrue womanhood. We have a full appreciation of all the great things\r\nwhich have been accomplished by women in education, in charity and in\r\nbenevolent work and in other channels of duty too numerous to mention,\r\nby which both men and women have been benefited, society improved and\r\nthe welfare of the human race advanced. We would take from women none\r\nof their privileges as citizens but we do not believe that women are\r\nadapted to the political work of the world.\r\n\r\nThe discussion of all questions growing out of the social and family\r\nrelations and local economic conditions has no direct relationship to\r\nthe right of women to participate in the political affairs of\r\ngovernment. The right of suffrage does not attach of right to the\r\nowners of property, for, if so, all other persons should be\r\ndisfranchised. It is not a fundamental right of taxpayers, for a great\r\nbody of men are not taxpayers, and nine-tenths of the women who would\r\nbecome voters, if woman suffrage were adopted, would be non-taxpayers.\r\nIt is not an inherent right of citizenship, for the time never was in\r\nthe whole history of the world when the franchise was granted to all\r\ncitizens.... Franchise is a privilege of government granted only to\r\nthose to whom the Government sees fit to grant it. As a law-abiding\r\npeople men and women alike should recognize once and for all that the\r\nright of suffrage is not a natural or inherent right of citizenship\r\nbut can only come by grant from the Government. [Legal authorities\r\nquoted.]\r\n\r\nWe must also recognize that woman suffrage is inconsistent with the\r\nfundamental principles upon which our representative government was\r\nfounded and to accept it now involves revolutionary changes. The\r\nframers of the Federal Constitution, a body of the wisest men the\r\ncountry has ever produced, did not recognize or provide for woman\r\nsuffrage. No one of the original thirteen States which adopted it\r\nprovided in their constitutions for woman suffrage. True it was\r\npermitted in New Jersey from 1776 to 1807, a period of thirty-one\r\nyears, when it was taken away by statute, by reason of unsatisfactory\r\nconditions and results. After the close of the Civil War, the southern\r\nStates which had gone into rebellion were admitted back into the\r\nUnion under constitutions limiting suffrage to men. These precedents\r\nin our governmental history were never departed from until in recent\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe greatest danger to the Republic of the United States today, as it\r\nalways has been in governments where the people rule, is in an\r\nexcitable and emotional suffrage. If the women of this country would\r\nalways think coolly and deliberate calmly, if they could always be\r\ncontrolled and act by judgment and not under passion, they might help\r\nus to keep our institutions \"eternal as the foundations of the\r\ncontinent itself\"; but the philosophers of history and the experience\r\nof the ages past and present tell us in unanswerable arguments and\r\nteach us by illustrations drawn from actual experience, that\r\ngovernments have been overturned or endangered in periods of great\r\nexcitement by emotional suffrage and the speech and writings of\r\nintolerant people....\r\n\r\nOpen that terrible page of the French Revolution and the days of\r\nterror, when the click of the guillotine and the rush of blood through\r\nthe streets of Paris demonstrated to what extremities the ferocity of\r\nhuman nature can be driven by political passion. Who led those\r\nbloodthirsty mobs? Who shrieked loudest in that hurricane of passion?\r\nWoman. Her picture upon the page of history is indelible. In the city\r\nof Paris, in those ferocious mobs, the controlling agency, nay, not\r\nagency but the controlling and principal power, came from those whom\r\nGod had intended to be the soft and gentle angels of mercy throughout\r\nthe world....\r\n\r\nIt has been said that if woman suffrage should become universal in the\r\nUnited States, in times of great excitement arising out of sectional\r\nquestions or local conditions this country would be in danger of State\r\ninsurrections and seditions and that in less than a hundred years\r\nrevolutions would occur and our republican form of government would\r\ncome to an end. The United States should guard against emotional\r\nsuffrage. What we need is to put more logic and less feeling into\r\npublic affairs. This country has already extended suffrage beyond\r\nreasonable bounds. Instead of enlarging it there are strong reasons\r\nwhy it should be curtailed. It would have been better for wise and\r\nsafe government and the welfare of all the people if there had been\r\nsome reasonable standard of fitness for the ballot.\r\n\r\nDuring the intense feeling and turbulent conditions growing out of the\r\nCivil War, suffrage was so extended that many of the southern States\r\nwere turned over to the political control of those not sufficiently\r\ninformed to conduct good government. It has taken half-a-century of\r\nstrenuous effort to correct that mistake. The granting of universal\r\nwoman suffrage would greatly increase the existing evil and put it\r\nbeyond the possibility of correction except by an ultimate revolution.\r\n\r\nWe hear it frequently stated that there is no argument against woman\r\nsuffrage except sentiment. We can reply with equal force that there is\r\nno argument for woman suffrage except sentiment, and that often\r\nmisguided and uninformed. Some suffragists insist that if woman\r\nsuffrage became universal \"it would set in motion the machinery of an\r\nearthly paradise.\" It was a woman of high standing in the literary and\r\njournalistic field who answered, \"It is my opinion it would let loose\r\nthe wheels of purgatory.\" ... Suffragists frequently ask the question,\r\n\"If we want to vote why should other people object?\" If it is wrong\r\nthey should not ask it any more than they should ask the privilege of\r\ncommitting a crime. If it is a wrong against the State every other\r\nman and woman has a right to object and it is their duty to object....\r\n\r\nThere are spheres in which feeling should be paramount. There are\r\nkingdoms in which the heart should reign supreme. That kingdom belongs\r\nto woman--the realm of sentiment, the realm of love, the realm of\r\ngentler and holier and kindlier attributes that make the name of wife,\r\nmother and sister next to the name of God himself, but it is not in\r\nharmony with suffrage and has no place in government.\r\n\r\nWe submit these considerations in all candor to the men of this State.\r\nUltimately the decision of this question at the polls is a man's\r\nquestion. We ask your cooperation....\r\n\r\nOmaha, July 6, 1914.\r\n\r\n  JOSEPH H. MILLARD, ex-U. S.

The other classes\r\nwho were opposed--the \"machine\" politicians, the liquor interests and\r\nthose directly or indirectly connected with them--for the most part\r\nworked more secretly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe contents of this volume are so arranged that the reader will have\r\nlittle difficulty in finding the references desired. The first\r\nforty-nine chapters are devoted exclusively to the work for woman\r\nsuffrage which was done in the various States of the Union through\r\nannual conventions, effort with the Legislatures for the submission to\r\nthe voters of an amendment to the State constitutions which would\r\nfully enfranchise women and campaigns to secure a majority vote for\r\nit. There was also an attempt to obtain from the Legislatures laws\r\nwhich did not have to be approved by the voters, giving women the\r\nright to vote at Municipal elections and every four years for\r\nPresidential electors. In addition the women in every State constantly\r\nassisted the National American Woman Suffrage Association in its\r\nsupreme effort to obtain from Congress the submission to the\r\nLegislatures for the ratifying of three-fourths of them of an\r\namendment to the Federal Constitution which would give the complete\r\nfranchise to all the women of the nation.\r\n\r\nThese State chapters are arranged alphabetically and near the end of\r\neach an account is given of the action taken on Ratification, and also\r\nof the forming of a League of Women Voters. It is manifestly\r\nimpracticable to index the names of all the thousands of women who\r\ngave devoted service in these States. Only a comparatively few of\r\nthose who worked longest and most prominently or are mentioned in\r\nother parts of the books can be listed. The names of many more will be\r\nfound in the various chapters. This is also true of the many members\r\nof Congress and Legislatures and of other men who were sympathetic and\r\nhelpful in this long contest.\r\n\r\nIn the chapters on the effort for woman suffrage in the Territories\r\nand possessions of the United States the principal points and workers\r\nare indexed. This is the case in the chapter on Great Britain and her\r\nColonies and on the countries of the world, each listed under its\r\nproper head. The long chapter on the International Woman Suffrage\r\nAlliance forbids an accurate index, as it contains the names of scores\r\nof workers for woman suffrage in most civilized countries. Some but\r\nnot all of the most prominent are noted and in the well indexed\r\nchapters on its seven congresses the reader will find a satisfactory\r\nroster.\r\n\r\nThe Table of Contents will act as a trustworthy guide.\r\n\r\n  A\r\n\r\n  Abbott, Frances M, in N.
