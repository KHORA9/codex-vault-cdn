Incongruous and full of skips and jumps as is that huddle of\r\ndiary-jottings, war-memoranda of 1862-'65, Nature-notes of 1877-'81,\r\nwith Western and Canadian observations afterwards, all bundled up and\r\ntied by a big string, the resolution and indeed mandate comes to me this\r\nday, this hour,--(and what a day! What an hour just passing! the luxury\r\nof riant grass and blowing breeze, with all the shows of sun and sky and\r\nperfect temperature, never before so filling me, body and soul),--to\r\ngo home, untie the bundle, reel out diary-scraps and memoranda, just as\r\nthey are, large or small, one after another, into print-pages,[1]\r\nand let the melange's lackings and wants of connection take care of\r\nthemselves. It will illustrate one phase of humanity anyhow; how few of\r\nlife's days and hours (and they not by relative value or proportion, but\r\nby chance) are ever noted. Probably another point, too, how we give long\r\npreparations for some object, planning and delving and fashioning, and\r\nthen, when the actual hour for doing arrives, find ourselves still quite\r\nunprepared, and tumble the thing together, letting hurry and crudeness\r\ntell the story better than fine work. At any rate I obey my happy\r\nhour's command, which seems curiously imperative. May be, if I don't\r\ndo anything else, I shall send out the most wayward, spontaneous,\r\nfragmentary book ever printed.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n[1] The pages from 1 to 15 are nearly verbatim an off-hand letter of\r\nmine in January, 1882, to an insisting friend. Following, I give some\r\ngloomy experiences. The war of attempted secession has, of course, been\r\nthe distinguishing event of my time. I commenced at the close of 1862,\r\nand continued steadily through '63, '64 and '65, to visit the sick\r\nand wounded of the army, both on the field and in the hospitals in and\r\naround Washington city. From the first I kept little note-books\r\nfor impromptu jottings in pencil to refresh my memory of names and\r\ncircumstances, and what was specially wanted, &c. In these, I brief'd\r\ncases, persons, sights, occurrences in camp, by the bed-side, and\r\nnot seldom by the corpses of the dead. Some were scratch'd down from\r\nnarratives I heard and itemized while watching, or waiting, or tending\r\nsomebody amid those scenes. I have dozens of such little note-books\r\nleft, forming a special history of those years, for myself alone, full\r\nof associations never to be possibly said or sung. I wish I could convey\r\nto the reader the associations that attach to these soil'd and creas'd\r\nlivraisons, each composed of a sheet or two of paper, folded small to\r\ncarry in the pocket, and fasten'd with a pin. I leave them just as I\r\nthrew them by after the war, blotch'd here and there with more than one\r\nblood-stain, hurriedly written, sometimes at the clinique, not seldom\r\namid the excitement of uncertainty, or defeat, or of action, or getting\r\nready for it, or a march. Most of the pages from 20 to 75 are verbatim\r\ncopies of those lurid and blood-smuch'd little notebooks.\r\n\r\nVery different are most of the memoranda that follow. Some time after\r\nthe war ended I had a paralytic stroke, which prostrated me for several\r\nyears. In 1876 I began to get over the worst of it. From this date,\r\nportions of several seasons, especially summers, I spent at a secluded\r\nhaunt down in Camden county, New Jersey--Timber creek, quite a little\r\nriver (it enters from the great Delaware, twelve miles away)--with\r\nprimitive solitudes, winding stream, recluse and woody banks,\r\nsweet-feeding springs, and all the charms that birds, grass,\r\nwild-flowers, rabbits and squirrels, old oaks, walnut trees, &c., can\r\nbring. Through these times, and on these spots, the diary from page 76\r\nonward was mostly written.\r\n\r\nThe COLLECT afterwards gathers up the odds and ends of whatever pieces\r\nI can now lay hands on, written at various times past, and swoops all\r\ntogether like fish in a net.\r\n\r\nI suppose I publish and leave the whole gathering, first, from that\r\neternal tendency to perpetuate and preserve which is behind all Nature,\r\nauthors included; second, to symbolize two or three specimen interiors,\r\npersonal and other, out of the myriads of my time, the middle range of\r\nthe Nineteenth century in the New World; a strange, unloosen'd, wondrous\r\ntime. But the book is probably without any definite purpose that can be\r\ntold in a statement.\r\n\r\n\r\nANSWER TO AN INSISTING FRIEND\r\n\r\nYou ask for items, details of my early life--of genealogy and\r\nparentage, particularly of the women of my ancestry, and of its far-back\r\nNetherlands stock on the maternal side--of the region where I was\r\nborn and raised, and my mother and father before me, and theirs before\r\nthem--with a word about Brooklyn and New York cities, the times I lived\r\nthere as lad and young man. You say you want to get at these details\r\nmainly as the go-befores and embryons of \"Leaves of Grass.\" Very good;\r\nyou shall have at least some specimens of them all. I have often thought\r\nof the meaning of such things--that one can only encompass and complete\r\nmatters of that kind by 'exploring behind, perhaps very far behind,\r\nthemselves directly, and so into their genesis, antecedents, and\r\ncumulative stages. Then as luck would have it, I lately whiled away the\r\ntedium of a week's half-sickness and confinement, by collating these\r\nvery items for another (yet unfulfilled, probably abandon'd,) purpose;\r\nand if you will be satisfied with them, authentic in date-occurrence and\r\nfact simply, and told my own way, garrulous-like, here they are. I shall\r\nnot hesitate to make extracts, for I catch at anything to save labor;\r\nbut those will be the best versions of what I want to convey.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENEALOGY--VAN VELSOR AND WHITMAN\r\n\r\nThe later years of the last century found the Van Velsor family, my\r\nmother's side, living on their own farm at Cold Spring, Long Island, New\r\nYork State, near the eastern edge of Queen's county, about a mile from\r\nthe harbor.[2] My father's side--probably the fifth generation from the\r\nfirst English arrivals in New England--were at the same time farmers\r\non their own land--(and a fine domain it was, 500 acres, all good soil,\r\ngently sloping east and south, about one-tenth woods, plenty of grand\r\nold trees,) two or three miles off, at West Hills, Suffolk county. The\r\nWhitman name in the Eastern States, and so branch and South, starts\r\nundoubtedly from one John Whitman, born 1602, in Old England, where he\r\ngrew up, married, and his eldest son was born in 1629. He came over in\r\nthe \"True Love\" in 1640 to America, and lived in Weymouth, Mass., which\r\nplace became the mother-hive of the New-Englanders of the name; he died\r\nin 1692. His brother, Rev. Zechariah Whitman, also came over in the\r\n\"True Love,\" either at that time or soon after, and lived at Milford,\r\nConn. A son of this Zechariah, named Joseph, migrated to Huntington,\r\nLong Island, and permanently settled there. Savage's \"Genealogical\r\nDictionary\" (vol. iv, p. 524) gets the Whitman family establish'd at\r\nHuntington, per this Joseph, before 1664. It is quite certain that from\r\nthat beginning, and from Joseph, the West Hill Whitmans, and all others\r\nin Suffolk county, have since radiated, myself among the number. John\r\nand Zechariah both went to England and back again divers times; they\r\nhad large families, and several of their children were born in the old\r\ncountry. We hear of the father of John and Zechariah, Abijah Whitman,\r\nwho goes over into the 1500's, but we know little about him, except that\r\nhe also was for some time in America.\r\n\r\nThese old pedigree-reminiscences come up to me vividly from a visit I\r\nmade not long since (in my 63d year) to West Hills, and to the burial\r\ngrounds of my ancestry, both sides. I extract from notes of that visit,\r\nwritten there and then:\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n[2] Long Island was settled first on the west end by the Dutch from\r\nHolland, then on the east end by the English--the dividing line of the\r\ntwo nationalities being a little west of Huntington where my father's\r\nfolks lived, and where I was born.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLD WHITMAN AND VAN VELSOR CEMETERIES\r\n\r\n_July 29, 1881_.--After more than forty years' absence, (except a brief\r\nvisit, to take my father there once more, two years before he died,)\r\nwent down Long Island on a week' s jaunt to the place where I was born,\r\nthirty miles from New York city. Rode around the old familiar spots,\r\nviewing and pondering and dwelling long upon them, every-thing coming\r\nback to me. Went to the old Whitman homestead on the upland and took a\r\nview eastward, inclining south, over the broad and beautiful farm lands\r\nof my grandfather (1780,) and my father. There was the new house (1810,)\r\nthe big oak a hundred and fifty or two hundred years old; there\r\nthe well, the sloping kitchen-garden, and a little way off even the\r\nwell-kept remains of the dwelling of my great-grandfather (1750-'60)\r\nstill standing, with its mighty timbers and low ceilings. Near by, a\r\nstately grove of tall, vigorous black-walnuts, beautiful, Apollo-like,\r\nthe sons or grandsons, no doubt, of black-walnuts during or before 1776.\r\nOn the other side of the road spread the famous apple orchard, over\r\ntwenty acres, the trees planted by hands long mouldering in the grave\r\n(my uncle Jesse's,) but quite many of them evidently capable of throwing\r\nout their annual blossoms and fruit yet.\r\n\r\nI now write these lines seated on an old grave (doubtless of a century\r\nsince at least) on the burial hill of the Whitmans of many generations.\r\nFifty or more graves are quite plainly traceable, and as many more\r\ndecay'd out of all form--depress'd mounds, crumbled and broken stones,\r\ncover'd with moss--the gray and sterile hill, the clumps of chestnuts\r\noutside, the silence, just varied by the soughing wind. There is\r\nalways the deepest eloquence of sermon or poem in any of these ancient\r\ngraveyards of which Long Island has so many; so what must this one have\r\nbeen to me? My whole family history, with its succession of links,\r\nfrom the first settlement down to date, told here--three centuries\r\nconcentrate on this sterile acre.\r\n\r\nThe next day, July 30, I devoted to the maternal locality, and if\r\npossible was still more penetrated and impress'd. I write this paragraph\r\non the burial hul of the Van Velsors, near Cold Spring, the most\r\nsignificant depository of the dead that could be imagin'd, without the\r\nslightest help from art, but far ahead of it, soil sterile, a mostly\r\nbare plateau-flat of half an acre, the top of a hill, brush and well\r\ngrown trees and dense woods bordering all around, very primi-tive,\r\nsecluded, no visitors, no road (you cannot drive here, you have to bring\r\nthe dead on foot, and follow on foot.) Two or three-score graves quite\r\nplain; as many more almost rubb'd out. My grandfather Cornelius and my\r\ngrandmother Amy (Naomi) and numerous relatives nearer or remoter, on\r\nmy mother's side, lie buried here. The scene as I stood or sat, the\r\ndelicate and wild odor of the woods, a slightly drizzling rain, the\r\nemotional atmosphere of the place, and the inferr'd reminiscences, were\r\nfitting accompaniments.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MATERNAL HOMESTEAD\r\n\r\nI went down from this ancient grave place eighty or ninety rods to the\r\nsite of the Van Velsor homestead, where my mother was born (1795,)\r\nand where every spot had been familiar to me as a child and youth\r\n(1825-'40.) Then stood there a long rambling, dark-gray, shingle-sided\r\nhouse, with sheds, pens, a great barn, and much open road-space. Now of\r\nall those not a vestige left; all had been pull'd down, erased, and the\r\nplough and harrow pass'd over foundations, road-spaces and everything,\r\nfor many summers; fenced in at present, and grain and clover growing\r\nlike any other fine fields. Only a big hole from the cellar, with some\r\nlittle heaps of broken stone, green with grass and weeds, identified\r\nthe place. Even the copious old brook and spring seem'd to have mostly\r\ndwindled away. The whole scene, with what it arous'd, memories of\r\nmy young days there half a century ago, the vast kitchen and ample\r\nfireplace and the sitting-room adjoining, the plain furniture, the\r\nmeals, the house full of merry people, my grandmother Amy's sweet old\r\nface in its Quaker cap, my grandfather \"the Major,\" jovial, red, stout,\r\nwith sonorous voice and characteristic physiognomy, with the actual\r\nsights themselves, made the most pronounc'd half-day's experience of my\r\nwhole jaunt.\r\n\r\nFor there with all those wooded, hilly, healthy surroundings, my dearest\r\nmother, Louisa Van Velsor, grew up--(her mother, Amy Williams, of the\r\nFriends' or Quakers' denomination--the Williams family, seven sisters\r\nand one brother--the father and brother sailors, both of whom met their\r\ndeaths at sea.) The Van Velsor people were noted for fine horses, which\r\nthe men bred and train'd from blooded stock. My mother, as a young\r\nwoman, was a daily and daring rider. As to the head of the family\r\nhimself, the old race of the Netherlands, so deeply grafted on Manhattan\r\nisland and in Kings and Queens counties, never yielded a more mark'd and\r\nfull Americanized specimen than Major Cornelius Van Velsor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO OLD FAMILY INTERIORS\r\n\r\nOf the domestic and inside life of the middle of Long Island, at and\r\njust before that time, here are two samples:\r\n\r\n\"The Whitmans, at the beginning of the present century, lived in a long\r\nstory-and-a-half farm-house, hugely timber'd, which is still standing.\r\nA great smoke-canopied kitchen, with vast hearth and chimney, form'd one\r\nend of the house. The existence of slavery in New York at that time, and\r\nthe possession by the family of some twelve or fifteen slaves, house and\r\nfield servants, gave things quite a patriarchial look. The very young\r\ndarkies could be seen, a swarm of them, toward sundown, in this kitchen,\r\nsquatted in a circle on the floor, eating their supper of Indian pudding\r\nand milk. In the house, and in food and furniture, all was rude, but\r\nsubstantial. No carpets or stoves were known, and no coffee, and tea or\r\nsugar only for the women. Rousing wood fires gave both warmth and light\r\non winter nights. Pork, poultry, beef, and all the ordinary vegetables\r\nand grains were plentiful. Cider was the men's common drink, and used at\r\nmeals. The clothes were mainly homespun. Journeys were made by both men\r\nand women on horseback. Both sexes labor'd with their own hands-the men\r\non the farm--the women in the house and around it. Books were scarce.\r\nThe annual copy of the almanac was a treat, and was pored over through\r\nthe long winter evenings. I must not forget to mention that both these\r\nfamilies were near enough to the sea to behold it from the high places,\r\nand to hear in still hours the roar of the surf; the latter, after\r\na storm, giving a peculiar sound at night. Then all hands, male and\r\nfemale, went down frequently on beach and bathing parties, and the men\r\non practical expeditions for cutting salt hay, and for clamming and\r\nfishing.\"--_John Burroughs's_ NOTES.\r\n\r\n\"The ancestors of Walt Whitman, on both the paternal and maternal\r\nsides, kept a good table, sustained the hospitalities, decorums, and an\r\nexcellent social reputation in the county, and they were often of mark'd\r\nindividuality. If space permitted, I should consider some of the men\r\nworthy special description; and still more some of the women. His\r\ngreat-grandmother on the paternal side, for instance, was a large\r\nswarthy woman, who lived to a very old age. She smoked tobacco, rode on\r\nhorseback like a man, managed the most vicious horse, and, becoming\r\na widow in later life, went forth every day over her farm-lands,\r\nfrequently in the saddle, directing the labor of her slaves, in\r\nlanguage in which, on exciting occasions, oaths were not spared. The\r\ntwo immediate grandmothers were, in the best sense, superior women. The\r\nmaternal one (Amy Williams before marriage) was a Friend, or Quakeress,\r\nof sweet, sensible character, house-wifely proclivities, and deeply\r\nintuitive and spiritual. The other (Hannah Brush,) was an equally noble,\r\nperhaps stronger character, lived to be very old, had quite a family of\r\nsons, was a natural lady, was in early life a school-mistress, and had\r\ngreat solidity of mind. W. W. himself makes much of the women of his\r\nancestry.\"--_The Same_.\r\n\r\nOut from these arrieres of persons and scenes, I was born May 31,\r\n1819. And now to dwell awhile on the locality itself--as the successive\r\ngrowth-stages of my infancy, childhood, youth and manhood were all\r\npass'd on Long Island, which I sometimes feel as if I had incorporated.\r\nI roam'd, as boy and man, and have lived in nearly all parts, from\r\nBrooklyn to Montauk point.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAUMANOK, AND MY LIFE ON IT AS CHILD AND YOUNG MAN\r\n\r\nWorth fully and particularly investigating indeed this Paumanok, (to\r\ngive the spot its aboriginal name[3],) stretching east through Kings,\r\nQueens and Suffolk counties, 120 miles altogether--on the north Long\r\nIsland sound, a beautiful, varied and picturesque series of inlets,\r\n\"necks\" and sea-like expansions, for a hundred miles to Orient point.\r\nOn the ocean side the great south bay dotted with countless hummocks,\r\nmostly small, some quite large, occasionally long bars of sand out two\r\nhundred rods to a mile-and-a-half from the shore. While now and then,\r\nas at Rockaway and far east along the Hamptons, the beach makes right\r\non the island, the sea dashing up without intervention. Several\r\nlight-houses on the shores east; a long history of wrecks tragedies,\r\nsome even of late years. As a youngster, I was in the atmosphere and\r\ntraditions of many of these wrecks--of one or two almost an observer.\r\nOff Hempstead beach for example, was the loss of the ship \"Mexico\" in\r\n1840, (alluded to in \"the Sleepers\" in L. of G.) And at Hampton, some\r\nyears later, the destruction of the brig \"Elizabeth,\" a fearful affair,\r\nin one of the worst winter gales, where Margaret Fuller went down, with\r\nher husband and child.\r\n\r\nInside the outer bars or beach this south bay is everywhere\r\ncomparatively shallow; of cold winters all thick ice on the surface.\r\nAs a boy I often went forth with a chum or two, on those frozen fields,\r\nwith hand-sled, axe and eel-spear, after messes of eels. We would cut\r\nholes in the ice, sometimes striking quite an eel-bonanza, and filling\r\nour baskets with great, fat, sweet, white-meated fellows. The scenes,\r\nthe ice, drawing the hand-sled, cutting holes, spearing the eels, &c.,\r\nwere of course just such fun as is dearest to boyhood. The shores of\r\nthis bay, winter and summer, and my doings there in early life, are\r\nwoven all through L. of G. One sport I was very fond of was to go on\r\na bay-party in summer to gather sea-gull's eggs. (The gulls lay two or\r\nthree eggs, more than half the size of hen's eggs, right on the sand,\r\nand leave the sun's heat to hatch them.)\r\n\r\nThe eastern end of Long Island, the Peconic bay region, I knew quite\r\nwell too--sail'd more than once around Shelter island, and down to\r\nMontauk--spent many an hour on Turtle hill by the old light-house, on\r\nthe extreme point, looking out over the ceaseless roll of the Atlantic.\r\nI used to like to go down there and fraternize with the blue-fishers,\r\nor the annual squads of sea-bass takers. Sometimes, along Montauk\r\npeninsula, (it is some 15 miles long, and good grazing,) met the\r\nstrange, unkempt, half-barbarous herdsmen, at that time living there\r\nentirely aloof from society or civilization, in charge, on those rich\r\npasturages, of vast droves of horses, kine or sheep, own'd by farmers\r\nof the eastern towns. Sometimes, too, the few remaining Indians, or\r\nhalf-breeds, at that period left on Montauk peninsula, but now I believe\r\naltogether extinct.\r\n\r\nMore in the middle of the island were the spreading Hempstead plains,\r\nthen (1830-'40) quite prairie-like, open, uninhabited, rather sterile,\r\ncover'd with kill-calf and huckleberry bushes, yet plenty of fair\r\npasture for the cattle, mostly milch-cows, who fed there by hundreds,\r\neven thousands, and at evening, (the plains too were own'd by the towns,\r\nand this was the use of them in common,) might be seen taking their way\r\nhome, branching off regularly in the right places. I have often been out\r\non the edges of these plains toward sundown, and can yet recall in\r\nfancy the interminable cow-processions, and hear the music of the tin or\r\ncopper bells clanking far or near, and breathe the cool of the sweet and\r\nslightly aromatic evening air, and note the sunset.\r\n\r\nThrough the same region of the island, but further east, extended wide\r\ncentral tracts of pine and scrub-oak, (charcoal was largely made here,)\r\nmonotonous and sterile. But many a good day or half-day did I have,\r\nwandering through those solitary crossroads, inhaling the peculiar\r\nand wild aroma. Here, and all along the island and its shores, I spent\r\nintervals many years, all seasons, sometimes riding, sometimes boating,\r\nbut generally afoot, (I was always then a good walker,) absorbing\r\nfields, shores, marine incidents, characters, the bay-men, farmers,\r\npilots-always had a plentiful acquaintance with the latter, and with\r\nfishermen--went every summer on sailing trips--always liked the bare\r\nsea-beach, south side, and have some of my happiest hours on it to this\r\nday.\r\n\r\nAs I write, the whole experience comes back to me after the lapse of\r\nforty and more years--the soothing rustle of the waves, and the saline\r\nsmell--boyhood's times, the clam-digging, bare-foot, and with trowsers\r\nroll'd up--hauling down the creek--the perfume of the sedge-meadows--the\r\nhay-boat, and the chowder and fishing excursions;--or, of later years,\r\nlittle voyages down and out New York bay, in the pilot boats. Those same\r\nlater years, also, while living in Brooklyn, (1836-'50) I went regularly\r\nevery week in the mild seasons down to Coney Island, at that time a\r\nlong, bare unfrequented shore, which I had all to myself, and where I\r\nloved, after bathing, to race up and down the hard sand, and declaim\r\nHomer or Shakspere to the surf and sea gulls by the hour. But I am\r\ngetting ahead too rapidly, and must keep more in my traces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n[3] \"Paumanok, (or Paumanake, or Paumanack, the Indian name of Long\r\nIsland,) over a hundred miles long; shaped like a fish--plenty of sea\r\nshore, sandy, stormy, uninviting, the horizon boundless, the air too\r\nstrong for invalids, the bays a wonderful resort for aquatic birds,\r\nthe south-side meadows cover'd with salt hay, the soil of the island\r\ngenerally tough, but good for the locust-tree, the apple orchard, and\r\nthe blackberry, and with numberless springs of the sweetest water in the\r\nworld. Years ago, among the bay-men--a strong, wild race, now extinct,\r\nor rather entirely changed--a native of Long Island was called a\r\n_Paumanacker_, or _Creole-'Paumanacker_.\"--_John Burroughs_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY FIRST READING--LAFAYETTE\r\n\r\nFrom 1824 to '28 our family lived in Brooklyn in Front, Cranberry and\r\nJohnson streets. In the latter my father built a nice house for a home,\r\nand afterwards another in Tillary street. We occupied them, one after\r\nthe other, but they were mortgaged, and we lost them. I yet remember\r\nLafayette's visit.[4] Most of these years I went to the public schools.\r\nIt must have been about 1829 or '30 that I went with my father and\r\nmother to hear Elias Hicks preach in a ball-room on Brooklyn heights. At\r\nabout the same time employ'd as a boy in an office, lawyers', father and\r\ntwo sons, Clarke's, Fulton street, near Orange. I had a nice desk and\r\nwindow-nook to myself; Edward C. kindly help'd me at my handwriting\r\nand composition, and, (the signal event of my life up to that time,)\r\nsubscribed for me to a big circulating library. For a time I now revel'd\r\nin romance-reading of all kinds; first, the \"Arabian Nights,\" all\r\nthe volumes, an amazing treat. Then, with sorties in very many other\r\ndirections, took in Walter Scott's novels, one after another, and his\r\npoetry, (and continue to enjoy novels and poetry to this day.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n[4] \"On the visit of General Lafayette to this country, in 1824, he came\r\nover to Brooklyn in state, and rode through the city. The children of\r\nthe schools turn'd out to join in the welcome. An edifice for a free\r\npublic library for youths was just then commencing, and Lafayette\r\nconsented to stop on his way and lay the corner-stone. Numerous children\r\narriving on the ground, where a huge irregular excavation for the\r\nbuilding was already dug, surrounded with heaps of rough stone, several\r\ngentlemen assisted in lifting the children to safe or convenient\r\nspots to see the ceremony. Among the rest, Lafayette, also helping the\r\nchildren, took up the five-year-old Walt Whitman, and pressing the child\r\na moment to his breast, and giving him a kiss, handed him down to a safe\r\nspot in the excavation.\"--John Burroughs.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINTING OFFICE--OLD BROOKLYN\r\n\r\nAfter about two years went to work in a weekly newspaper and printing\r\noffice, to learn the trade. The paper was the \"Long Island Patriot,\"\r\nowned by S. E. Clements, who was also postmaster. An old printer in\r\nthe office, William Hartshorne, a revolutionary character, who had seen\r\nWashington, was a special friend of mine, and I had many a talk with him\r\nabout long past times. The apprentices, including myself, boarded with\r\nhis grand-daughter. I used occasionally to go out riding with the boss,\r\nwho was very kind to us boys; Sundays he took us all to a great old\r\nrough, fortress-looking stone church, on Joralemon street, near where\r\nthe Brooklyn city hall now is--(at that time broad fields and country\r\nroads everywhere around.[5]) Afterward I work'd on the \"Long Island\r\nStar,\" Alden Spooner's paper. My father all these years pursuing his\r\ntrade as carpenter and builder, with varying fortune. There was a\r\ngrowing family of children--eight of us--my brother Jesse the oldest,\r\nmyself the second, my dear sisters Mary and Hannah Louisa, my brothers\r\nAndrew, George, Thomas Jefferson, and then my youngest brother, Edward,\r\nborn 1835, and always badly crippled, as I am myself of late years.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n[5] Of the Brooklyn of that time (1830-40) hardly anything remains,\r\nexcept the lines of the old streets. The population was then between ten\r\nand twelve thousand. For a mile Fulton street was lined with magnificent\r\nelm trees. The character of the place was thoroughly rural. As a sample\r\nof comparative values, it may be mention'd that twenty-five acres in\r\nwhat is now the most costly part of the city, bounded by Flatbush and\r\nFulton avenues, were then bought by Mr Parmentier, a French _emigré_,\r\nfor $4000. Who remembers the old places as they were? Who remembers the\r\nold citizens of that time? Among the former were Smith & Wood's, Coe\r\nDowning's, and other public houses at the ferry, the old Ferry itself,\r\nLove lane, the Heights as then, the Wallabout with the wooden bridge,\r\nand the road out beyond Fulton street to the old toll-gate. Among the\r\nlatter were the majestic and genial General Jeremiah Johnson, with\r\nothers, Gabriel Furman, Rev. E. M. Johnson, Alden Spooner, Mr.\r\nPierrepont, Mr. Joralemon, Samuel Willoughby, Jonathan Trotter, George\r\nHall, Cyrus P. Smith, N. B. Morse, John Dikeman, Adrian Hegeman, William\r\nUdall, and old Mr. Duflon, with his military garden.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROWTH--HEALTH--WORK\r\n\r\nI develop'd (1833-4-5) into a healthy, strong youth (grew too fast,\r\nthough, was nearly as big as a man at 15 or 16.) Our family at this\r\nperiod moved back to the country, my dear mother very ill for a long\r\ntime, but recover'd. All these years I was down Long Island more or less\r\nevery summer, now east, now west, sometimes months at a stretch. At\r\n16, 17, and so on, was fond of debating societies, and had an active\r\nmembership with them, off and on, in Brooklyn and one or two country\r\ntowns on the island. A most omnivorous novel-reader, these and later\r\nyears, devour'd everything I could get. Fond of the theatre, also, in\r\nNew York, went whenever I could--sometimes witnessing fine performances.\r\n\r\n1836-7, work'd as compositor in printing offices in New York city. Then,\r\nwhen little more than 18, and for a while afterwards, went to teaching\r\ncountry schools down in Queens and Suffolk counties, Long Island, and\r\n\"boarded round.\" (This latter I consider one of my best experiences and\r\ndeepest lessons in human nature behind the scenes and in the masses.)\r\nIn '39, '40, I started and publish'd a weekly paper in my native town,\r\nHuntington. Then returning to New York city and Brooklyn, work'd on as\r\nprinter and writer, mostly prose, but an occasional shy at \"poetry\".\r\n\r\n\r\nMY PASSION FOR FERRIES\r\n\r\nLiving in Brooklyn or New York city from this time forward, my life,\r\nthen, and still more the following years, was curiously identified with\r\nFulton ferry, already becoming the greatest of its sort in the world\r\nfor general importance, volume, variety, rapidity, and picturesqueness.\r\nAlmost daily, later, ('50 to '60,) I cross'd on the boats, often up\r\nin the pilot-houses where I could get a full sweep, absorbing\r\nshows, accompaniments, surroundings. What oceanic currents, eddies,\r\nunderneath--the great tides of humanity also, with ever-shifting\r\nmovements. Indeed, I have always had a passion for ferries; to me they\r\nafford inimitable, streaming, never-failing, living poems. The river\r\nand bay scenery, all about New York island, any time of a fine day--the\r\nhurrying, splashing sea-tides--the changing panorama of steamers, all\r\nsizes, often a string of big ones outward bound to distant ports--the\r\nmyriads of white-sail'd schooners, sloops, skiffs, and the marvellously\r\nbeautiful yachts--the majestic sound boats as they rounded the Battery\r\nand came along towards 5, afternoon, eastward bound--the prospect off\r\ntowards Staten Island, or down the Narrows, or the other way up the\r\nHudson--what refreshment of spirit such sights and experiences gave me\r\nyears ago (and many a time since.) My old pilot friends, the Balsirs,\r\nJohnny Cole, Ira Smith, William White, and my young ferry friend, Tom\r\nGere--how well I remember them all.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROADWAY SIGHTS\r\n\r\nBesides Fulton ferry, off and on for years, I knew and frequented\r\nBroadway--that noted avenue of New York's crowded and mixed humanity,\r\nand of so many notables. Here I saw, during those times, Andrew Jackson,\r\nWebster, Clay, Seward, Martin Van Buren, filibuster Walker, Kossuth,\r\nFitz Greene Halleck, Bryant, the Prince of Wales, Charles Dickens, the\r\nfirst Japanese ambassadors, and lots of other celebrities of the time.\r\nAlways something novel or inspiriting; yet mostly to me the hurrying and\r\nvast amplitude of those never-ending human currents. I remember seeing\r\nJames Fenimore Cooper in a court-room in Chambers street, back of the\r\ncity hall, where he was carrying on a law case--(I think it was a charge\r\nof libel he had brought against some one.) I also remember seeing Edgar\r\nA. Poe, and having a short interview with him, (it must have been in\r\n1845 or '6,) in his office, second story of a corner building, (Duane\r\nor Pearl street.) He was editor and owner or part owner of \"the Broadway\r\nJournal.\" The visit was about a piece of mine he had publish'd. Poe was\r\nvery cordial, in a quiet way, appear'd well in person, dress, &c. I\r\nhave a distinct and pleasing remembrance of his looks, voice, manner and\r\nmatter; very kindly and human, but subdued, perhaps a little jaded. For\r\nanother of my reminiscences, here on the west side, just below Houston\r\nstreet, I once saw (it must have been about 1832, of a sharp, bright\r\nJanuary day) a bent, feeble but stout-built very old man, bearded,\r\nswathed in rich furs, with a great ermine cap on his head, led and\r\nassisted, almost carried, down the steps of his high front stoop (a\r\ndozen friends and servants, emulous, carefully holding, guiding him) and\r\nthen lifted and tuck'd in a gorgeous sleigh, envelop'd in other furs,\r\nfor a ride. The sleigh was drawn by as fine a team of horses as I ever\r\nsaw. (You needn't think all the best animals are brought up nowadays;\r\nnever was such horseflesh as fifty years ago on Long Island, or south,\r\nor in New York city; folks look'd for spirit and mettle in a nag, not\r\ntame speed merely.) Well, I, a boy of perhaps 13 or 14, stopp'd and\r\ngazed long at the spectacle of that fur-swathed old man, surrounded by\r\nfriends and servants, and the careful seating of him in the sleigh. I\r\nremember the spirited, champing horses, the driver with his whip, and a\r\nfellow-driver by his side, for extra prudence. The old man, the subject\r\nof so much attention, I can almost see now. It was John Jacob Astor.\r\n\r\nThe years 1846, '47, and there along, see me still in New York City,\r\nworking as writer and printer, having my usual good health, and a good\r\ntime generally.\r\n\r\n\r\nOMNIBUS JAUNTS AND DRIVERS\r\n\r\nOne phase of those days must by no means go unrecorded--namely, the\r\nBroadway omnibuses, with their drivers.\r\n\r\nThe vehicles still (I write this paragraph in 1881) give a portion\r\nof the character of Broadway--the Fifth avenue, Madison avenue, and\r\nTwenty-third street lines yet running. But the flush days of the old\r\nBroadway stages, characteristic and copious, are over. The Yellow-birds,\r\nthe Red-birds, the original Broadway, the Fourth avenue, the\r\nKnickerbocker, and a dozen others of twenty or thirty years ago, are all\r\ngone. And the men specially identified with them, and giving vitality\r\nand meaning to them--the drivers--a strange, natural, quick-eyed and\r\nwondrous race--(not only Rabelais and Cervantes would have gloated upon\r\nthem, but Homer and Shakspere would)--how well I remember them, and\r\nmust here give a word about them. How many hours, forenoons and\r\nafternoons--how many exhilarating night-times I have had--perhaps June\r\nor July, in cooler air-riding the whole length of Broadway, listening\r\nto some yarn, (and the most vivid yarns ever spun, and the rarest\r\nmimicry)--or perhaps I declaiming some stormy passage from Julius Caesar\r\nor Richard, (you could roar as loudly as you chose in that heavy, dense,\r\nuninterrupted street-bass.) Yes, I knew all the drivers then, Broadway\r\nJack, Dressmaker, Balky Bill, George Storms, Old Elephant, his brother\r\nYoung Elephant (who came afterward,) Tippy, Pop Rice, Big Frank,\r\nYellow Joe, Pete Callahan, Patsey Dee, and dozens more; for there were\r\nhundreds. They had immense qualities, largely animal--eating, drinking;\r\nwomen--great personal pride, in their way--perhaps a few slouches here\r\nand there, but I should have trusted the general run of them, in their\r\nsimple good-will and honor, under all circumstances. Not only for\r\ncomradeship, and sometimes affection--great studies I found them also.\r\n(I suppose the critics will laugh heartily, but the influence of those\r\nBroadway omnibus jaunts and drivers and declamations and escapades\r\nundoubtedly enter'd into the gestation of \"Leaves of Grass.\")\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAYS AND OPERAS TOO\r\n\r\nAnd certain actors and singers, had a good deal to do with the business.\r\nAll through these years, off and on, I frequented the old Park, the\r\nBowery, Broadway and Chatham-square theatres, and the Italian operas\r\nat Chambers-street, Astor-place or the Battery--many seasons was on\r\nthe free list, writing for papers even as quite a youth. The old Park\r\ntheatre--what names, reminiscences, the words bring back! Placide,\r\nClarke, Mrs. Vernon, Fisher, Clara F., Mrs. Wood, Mrs. Seguin,\r\nEllen Tree, Hackett, the younger Kean, Macready, Mrs. Richardson,\r\nRice--singers, tragedians, comedians. What perfect acting! Henry Placide\r\nin \"Napoleon's Old Guard\" or \"Grandfather Whitehead,\"--or \"the Provoked\r\nHusband\" of Gibber, with Fanny Kemble as Lady Townley--or Sheridan\r\nKnowles in his own \"Virginius\"--or inimitable Power in \"Born to Good\r\nLuck.\" These, and many more, the years of youth and onward. Fanny\r\nKemble--name to conjure up great mimic scenes withal--perhaps the\r\ngreatest. I remember well her rendering of Bianca in \"Fazio,\" and\r\nMarianna in \"the Wife.\" Nothing finer did ever stage exhibit--the\r\nveterans of all nations said so, and my boyish heart and head felt it in\r\nevery minute cell. The lady was just matured, strong, better than merely\r\nbeautiful, born from the footlights, had had three years' practice in\r\nLondon and through the British towns, and then she came to give America\r\nthat young maturity and roseate power in all their noon, or rather\r\nforenoon, flush. It was my good luck to see her nearly every night she\r\nplay'd at the old Park--certainly in all her principal characters. I\r\nheard, these years, well render'd, all the Italian and other operas\r\nin vogue, \"Sonnambula,\" \"the Puritans,\" \"Der Freischutz,\" \"Huguenots,\"\r\n\"Fille d'Regiment,\" \"Faust,\" \"Etoile du Nord,\" \"Poliuto,\" and others.\r\nVerdi's \"Ernani,\" \"Rigoletto,\" and \"Trovatore,\" with Donnizetti's\r\n\"Lucia\" or \"Favorita\" or \"Lucrezia,\" and Auber's \"Massaniello,\" or\r\nRossini's \"William Tell\" and \"Gazza Ladra,\" were among my special\r\nenjoyments. I heard Alboni every time she sang in New York and\r\nvicinity--also Grisi, the tenor Mario, and the baritone Badiali, the\r\nfinest in the world.\r\n\r\nThis musical passion follow'd my theatrical one. As a boy or young man\r\nI had seen, (reading them carefully the day beforehand,) quite all\r\nShakspere's acting dramas, play'd wonderfully well. Even yet I cannot\r\nconceive anything finer than old Booth in \"Richard Third,\" or \"Lear,\"\r\n(I don't know which was best,) or Iago, (or Pescara, or Sir Giles\r\nOverreach, to go outside of Shakspere)--or Tom Hamblin in \"Macbeth\"--or\r\nold Clarke, either as the ghost in \"Hamlet,\" or as Prospero in \"the\r\nTempest,\" with Mrs. Austin as Ariel, and Peter Richings as Caliban. Then\r\nother dramas, and fine players in them, Forrest as Metamora or Damon or\r\nBrutus--John R. Scott as Tom Cringle or Rolla--or Charlotte Cushman's\r\nLady Gay Spanker in \"London Assurance.\" Then of some years later, at\r\nCastle Garden, Battery, I yet recall the splendid seasons of the Havana\r\nmusical troupe under Maretzek--the fine band, the cool sea-breezes,\r\nthe unsurpass'd vocalism--Steffan'one, Bosio, Truffi, Marini in \"Marino\r\nFaliero,\" \"Don Pasquale,\" or \"Favorita.\" No better playing or singing\r\never in New York. It was here too I afterward heard Jenny Lind. (The\r\nBattery--its past associations--what tales those old trees and walks and\r\nsea-walls could tell!)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHROUGH EIGHT YEARS.\r\n\r\nIn 1848, '49, I was occupied as editor of the \"daily Eagle\" newspaper,\r\nin Brooklyn. The latter year went off on a leisurely journey and working\r\nexpedition (my brother Jeff with me) through all the middle States, and\r\ndown the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Lived awhile in New Orleans, and\r\nwork'd there on the editorial staff of \"daily Crescent\" newspaper. After\r\na time plodded back northward, up the Mississippi, and around to, and by\r\nway of the great lakes, Michigan, Huron, and Erie, to Niagara falls and\r\nlower Canada, finally returning through central New York and down the\r\nHudson; traveling altogether probably 8,000 miles this trip, to and fro.\r\n'51, '53, occupied in house-building in Brooklyn. (For a little of\r\nthe first part of that time in printing a daily and weekly paper,\r\n\"the Freeman.\") '55, lost my dear father this year by death. Commenced\r\nputting \"Leaves of Grass\" to press for good, at the job printing office\r\nof my friends, the brothers Rome, in Brooklyn, after many MS. doings\r\nand undoings--(I had great trouble in leaving out the stock \"poetical\"\r\ntouches, but succeeded at last.) I am now (1856-'7) passing through my\r\n37th year.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES OF CHARACTER--RESULTS--1860\r\n\r\nTo sum up the foregoing from the outset (and, of course, far, far more\r\nunrecorded,) I estimate three leading sources and formative stamps to\r\nmy own character, now solidified for good or bad, and its subsequent\r\nliterary and other outgrowth--the maternal nativity-stock brought\r\nhither from far-away Netherlands, for one, (doubtless the best)--the\r\nsubterranean tenacity and central bony structure (obstinacy, wilfulness)\r\nwhich I get from my paternal English elements, for another--and the\r\ncombination of my Long Island birth-spot, sea-shores, childhood's\r\nscenes, absorptions, with teeming Brooklyn and New York--with, I\r\nsuppose, my experiences afterward in the secession outbreak, for the\r\nthird.\r\n\r\nFor, in 1862, startled by news that my brother George, an officer in\r\nthe 51st New York volunteers, had been seriously wounded (first\r\nFredericksburg battle, December 13th,) I hurriedly went down to the\r\nfield of war in Virginia. But I must go back a little.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPENING OF THE SECESSION WAR\r\n\r\nNews of the attack on fort Sumter and _the flag_ at Charleston harbor,\r\nS. C., was receiv'd in New York city late at night (13th April, 1861,)\r\nand was immediately sent out in extras of the newspapers. I had been to\r\nthe opera in Fourteenth street that night, and after the performance was\r\nwalking down Broadway toward twelve o'clock, on my way to Brooklyn,\r\nwhen I heard in the distance the loud cries of the newsboys, who came\r\npresently tearing and yelling up the street, rushing from side to side\r\neven more furiously than usual. I bought an extra and cross'd to the\r\nMetropolitan hotel (Niblo's) where the great lamps were still brightly\r\nblazing, and, with a crowd of others, who gather'd impromptu, read the\r\nnews, which was evidently authentic. For the benefit of some who had no\r\npapers, one of us read the telegram aloud, while all listen'd silently\r\nand attentively. No remark was made by any of the crowd, which had\r\nincreas'd to thirty or forty, but all stood a minute or two, I remember,\r\nbefore they dispers'd. I can almost see them there now, under the lamps\r\nat midnight again.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONAL UPRISING AND VOLUNTEERING\r\n\r\nI have said somewhere that the three Presidentiads preceding 1861 show'd\r\nhow the weakness and wickedness of rulers are just as eligible here in\r\nAmerica under republican, as in Europe under dynastic influences. But\r\nwhat can I say of that prompt and splendid wrestling with secession\r\nslavery, the arch-enemy personified, the instant he unmistakably show'd\r\nhis face? The volcanic upheaval of the nation, after that firing on\r\nthe flag at Charleston, proved for certain something which had been\r\npreviously in great doubt, and at once substantially settled the\r\nquestion of disunion. In my judgment it will remain as the grandest and\r\nmost encouraging spectacle yet vouchsafed in any age, old or new,\r\nto political progress and democracy. It was not for what came to the\r\nsurface merely--though that was important--but what it indicated\r\nbelow, which was of eternal importance. Down in the abysms of New World\r\nhumanity there had form'd and harden'd a primal hardpan of national\r\nUnion will, determin'd and in the majority, refusing to be tamper'd with\r\nor argued against, confronting all emergencies, and capable at any time\r\nof bursting all surface bonds, and breaking out like an earthquake. It\r\nis, indeed, the best lesson of the century, or of America, and it is\r\na mighty privilege to have been part of it. (Two great spectacles,\r\nimmortal proofs of democracy, unequall'd in all the history of the past,\r\nare furnish'd by the secession war--one at the beginning, the other at\r\nits close. Those are, the general, voluntary, arm'd upheaval, and the\r\npeaceful and harmonious disbanding of the armies in the summer of 1865.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTEMPTUOUS FEELING\r\n\r\nEven after the bombardment of Sumter, however, the gravity of the\r\nrevolt, and the power and will of the slave States for a strong and\r\ncontinued military resistance to national authority, were not at all\r\nrealized at the North, except by a few. Nine-tenths of the people of\r\nthe free States look'd upon the rebellion, as started in South Carolina,\r\nfrom a feeling one-half of contempt, and the other half composed of\r\nanger and incredulity. It was not thought it would be join'd in by\r\nVirginia, North Carolina, or Georgia. A great and cautious national\r\nofficial predicted that it would blow over \"in sixty days,\" and folks\r\ngenerally believ'd the prediction. I remember talking about it on a\r\nFulton ferry-boat with the Brooklyn mayor, who said he only \"hoped the\r\nSouthern fire-eaters would commit some overt act of resistance, as they\r\nwould then be at once so effectually squelch'd, we would never hear of\r\nsecession again--but he was afraid they never would have the pluck to\r\nreally do anything.\"\r\n\r\nI remember, too, that a couple of companies of the Thirteenth Brooklyn,\r\nwho rendezvou'd at the city armory, and started thence as thirty days'\r\nmen, were all provided with pieces of rope, conspicuously tied to their\r\nmusket-barrels, with which to bring back each man a prisoner from the\r\naudacious South, to be led in a noose, on our men's early and triumphant\r\nreturn!\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF BULL RUN, JULY, 1861\r\n\r\nAll this sort of feeling was destin'd to be arrested and revers'd by a\r\nterrible shock--the battle of first Bull Run--certainly, as we now know\r\nit, one of the most singular fights on record. (All battles, and their\r\nresults, are far more matters of accident than is generally thought; but\r\nthis was throughout a casualty, a chance. Each side supposed it had won,\r\ntill the last moment. One had, in point of fact, just the same right\r\nto be routed as the other. By a fiction, or series of fictions, the\r\nnational forces at the last moment exploded in a panic and fled from the\r\nfield.) The defeated troops commenced pouring into Washington over the\r\nLong Bridge at daylight on Monday, 22d--day drizzling all through with\r\nrain. The Saturday and Sunday of the battle (20th, 21st,) had been\r\nparch'd and hot to an extreme--the dust, the grime and smoke, in layers,\r\nsweated in, follow'd by other layers again sweated in, absorb'd by those\r\nexcited souls--their clothes all saturated with the clay-powder filling\r\nthe air--stirr'd up everywhere on the dry roads and trodden fields by\r\nthe regiments, swarming wagons, artillery, &c.--all the men with this\r\ncoating of murk and sweat and rain, now recoiling back, pouring over the\r\nLong Bridge--a horrible march of twenty miles, returning to Washington\r\nbaffed, humiliated, panic-struck. Where are the vaunts, and the proud\r\nboasts with which you went forth? Where are your banners, and your bands\r\nof music, and your ropes to bring back your prisoners? Well, there isn't\r\na band playing--and there isn't a flag but clings ashamed and lank to\r\nits staff.\r\n\r\nThe sun rises, but shines not. The men appear, at first sparsely and\r\nshame-faced enough, then thicker, in the streets of Washington--appear\r\nin Pennsylvania avenue, and on the steps and basement entrances. They\r\ncome along in disorderly mobs, some in squads, stragglers, companies.\r\nOccasionally, a rare regiment, in perfect order, with its officers (some\r\ngaps, dead, the true braves,) marching in silence, with lowering faces,\r\nstern, weary to sinking, all black and dirty, but every man with his\r\nmusket, and stepping alive; but these are the exceptions. Sidewalks\r\nof Pennsylvania avenue, Fourteenth street, &c., crowded, jamm'd with\r\ncitizens, darkies, clerks, everybody, lookers-on; women in the windows,\r\ncurious expressions from faces, as those swarms of dirt-cover'd return'd\r\nsoldiers there (will they never end?) move by; but nothing said, no\r\ncomments; (half our lookers-on secesh of the most venomous kind--they\r\nsay nothing; but the devil snickers in their faces.) During the\r\nforenoon Washington gets all over motley with these defeated\r\nsoldiers--queer-looking objects, strange eyes and faces, drench'd (the\r\nsteady rain drizzles on all day) and fearfully worn, hungry, haggard,\r\nblister'd in the feet. Good people (but not over-many of them either,)\r\nhurry up something for their grub. They put wash-kettles on the fire,\r\nfor soup, for coffee. They set tables on the side-walks--wagon-loads\r\nof bread are purchas'd, swiftly cut in stout chunks. Here are two aged\r\nladies, beautiful, the first in the city for culture and charm, they\r\nstand with store of eating and drink at an improvis'd table of rough\r\nplank, and give food, and have the store replenished from their house\r\nevery half-hour all that day; and there in the rain they stand, active,\r\nsilent, white-hair'd, and give food, though the tears stream down their\r\ncheeks, almost without intermission, the whole time. Amid the deep\r\nexcitement, crowds and motion, and desperate eagerness, it seems strange\r\nto see many, very many, of the soldiers sleeping--in the midst of all,\r\nsleeping sound. They drop down anywhere, on the steps of houses, up\r\nclose by the basements or fences, on the sidewalk, aside on some vacant\r\nlot, and deeply sleep. A poor 17 or 18 year old boy lies there, on the\r\nstoop of a grand house; he sleeps so calmly, so profoundly. Some clutch\r\ntheir muskets firmly even in sleep. Some in squads; comrades, brothers,\r\nclose together--and on them, as they lay, sulkily drips the rain.\r\n\r\nAs afternoon pass'd, and evening came, the streets, the bar-rooms, knots\r\neverywhere, listeners, questioners, terrible yarns, bugaboo, mask'd\r\nbatteries, our regiment all cut up, &c.--stories and story-tellers,\r\nwindy, bragging, vain centres of street-crowds. Resolution, manliness,\r\nseem to have abandon'd Washington. The principal hotel, Willard's, is\r\nfull of shoulder-straps--thick, crush'd, creeping with shoulder-straps.\r\n(I see them, and must have a word with them. There you are,\r\nshoulder-straps!--but where are your companies? where are your men?\r\nIncompetents! never tell me of chances of battle, of getting stray'd,\r\nand the like. I think this is your work, this retreat, after all. Sneak,\r\nblow, put on airs there in Willard's sumptuous parlors and bar-rooms, or\r\nanywhere--no explanation shall save you. Bull Run is your work; had you\r\nbeen half or one-tenth worthy your men, this would never have happen'd.)\r\n\r\nMeantime, in Washington, among the great persons and their entourage, a\r\nmixture of awful consternation, uncertainty, rage, shame, helplessness,\r\nand stupefying disappointment. The worst is not only imminent, but\r\nalready here. In a few hours--perhaps before the next meal--the secesh\r\ngenerals, with their victorious hordes, will be upon us. The dream of\r\nhumanity, the vaunted Union we thought so strong, so impregnable--lo!\r\nit seems already smash'd like a china plate. One bitter, bitter\r\nhour--perhaps proud America will never again know such an hour. She must\r\npack and fly--no time to spare. Those white palaces--the dome-crown'd\r\ncapitol there on the hill, so stately over the trees--shall they be\r\nleft--or destroy'd first? For it is certain that the talk among certain\r\nof the magnates and officers and clerks and officials everywhere, for\r\ntwenty-four hours in and around Washington after Bull Run, was loud\r\nand undisguised for yielding out and out, and substituting the southern\r\nrule, and Lincoln promptly abdicating and departing. If the secesh\r\nofficers and forces had immediately follow'd, and by a bold Napoleonic\r\nmovement had enter'd Washington the first day, (or even the second,)\r\nthey could have had things their own way, and a powerful faction north\r\nto back them. One of our returning colonels express'd in public that\r\nnight, amid a swarm of officers and gentlemen in a crowded room, the\r\nopinion that it was useless to fight, that the southerners had made\r\ntheir title clear, and that the best course for the national government\r\nto pursue was to desist from any further attempt at stopping them, and\r\nadmit them again to the lead, on the best terms they were willing to\r\ngrant. Not a voice was rais'd against this judgment, amid that large\r\ncrowd of officers and gentlemen. (The fact is, the hour was one of the\r\nthree or four of those crises we had then and afterward, during the\r\nfluctuations of four years, when human eyes appear'd at least just as\r\nlikely to see the last breath of the Union as to see it continue.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STUPOR PASSES--SOMETHING ELSE BEGINS\r\n\r\nBut the hour, the day, the night pass'd, and whatever returns, an\r\nhour, a day, a night like that can never again return. The President,\r\nrecovering himself, begins that very night--sternly, rapidly sets about\r\nthe task of reorganizing his forces, and placing himself in positions\r\nfor future and surer work. If there were nothing else of Abraham Lincoln\r\nfor history to stamp him with, it is enough to send him with his wreath\r\nto the memory of all future time, that he endured that hour, that day,\r\nbitterer than gall--indeed a crucifixion day--that it did not conquer\r\nhim--that he unflinchingly stemm'd it, and resolv'd to lift himself and\r\nthe Union out of it.\r\n\r\nThen the great New York papers at once appear'd, (commencing that\r\nevening, and following it up the next morning, and incessantly through\r\nmany days afterwards,) with leaders that rang out over the land with\r\nthe loudest, most reverberating ring of clearest bugles, full\r\nof encouragement, hope, inspiration, unfaltering defiance; Those\r\nmagnificent editorials! they never flagg'd for a fortnight. The \"Herald\"\r\ncommenced them--I remember the articles well. The \"Tribune\" was equally\r\ncogent and inspiriting--and the \"Times,\" \"Evening Post,\" and other\r\nprincipal papers, were not a whit behind. They came in good time,\r\nfor they were needed. For in the humiliation of Bull Run, the popular\r\nfeeling north, from its extreme of superciliousness, recoil'd to the\r\ndepth of gloom and apprehension.\r\n\r\n(Of all the days of the war, there are two especially I can never\r\nforget. Those were the day following the news, in New York and Brooklyn,\r\nof that first Bull Run defeat, and the day of Abraham Lincoln's death.\r\nI was home in Brooklyn on both occasions. The day of the murder we heard\r\nthe news very early in the morning. Mother prepared breakfast--and\r\nother meals afterward--as usual; but not a mouthful was eaten all day by\r\neither of us. We each drank half a cup of coffee; that was all. Little\r\nwas said. We got every newspaper morning and evening, and the frequent\r\nextras of that period, and pass'd them silently to each other.)\r\n\r\n\r\nDOWN AT THE FRONT\r\n\r\nFALMOUTH, VA., _opposite Fredericksburgh, December 21, 1862_.--Begin my\r\nvisits among the camp hospitals in the army of the Potomac. Spend a\r\ngood part of the day in a large brick mansion on the banks of the\r\nRappahannock, used as a hospital since the battle--seems to have\r\nreceiv'd only the worst cases. Out doors, at the foot of a tree, within\r\nten yards of the front of the house, I notice a heap of amputated feet,\r\nlegs, arms, hands, &c., a full load for a one-horse cart. Several dead\r\nbodies lie near, each cover'd with its brown woolen blanket. In the\r\ndoor-yard, towards the river, are fresh graves, mostly of officers,\r\ntheir names on pieces of arrel-staves or broken boards, stuck in the\r\ndirt. (Most of these bodies were subsequently taken up and transported\r\nnorth to their friends.) The large mansion is quite crowded upstairs\r\nand down, everything impromptu, no system, all bad enough, but I have\r\nno doubt the best that can be done; all the wounds pretty bad, some\r\nfrightful, the men in their old clothes, unclean and bloody. Some of\r\nthe wounded are rebel soldiers and officers, prisoners. One, a\r\nMississippian, a captain, hit badly in leg, I talk'd with some time; he\r\nask'd me for papers, which I gave him. (I saw him three months afterward\r\nin Washington, with his leg amputated, doing well.) I went through the\r\nrooms, downstairs and up. Some of the men were dying. I had nothing to\r\ngive at that visit, but wrote a few letters to folks home, mothers, &c.\r\nAlso talk'd to three or four, who seem'd most susceptible to it, and\r\nneeding it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER FIRST FREDERICKSBURG\r\n\r\n_December 23 to 31_.--The results of the late battle are exhibited\r\neverywhere about here in thousands of cases, (hundreds die every day,)\r\nin the camp, brigade, and division hospitals. These are merely tents,\r\nand sometimes very poor ones, the wounded lying on the ground, lucky if\r\ntheir blankets are spread on layers of pine or hemlock twigs, or small\r\nleaves. No cots; seldom even a mattress. It is pretty cold. The ground\r\nis frozen hard, and there is occasional snow. I go around from one case\r\nto another. I do not see that I do much good to these wounded and dying;\r\nbut I cannot leave them. Once in a while some youngster holds on to me\r\nconvulsively, and I do what I can for him; at any rate, stop with him\r\nand sit near him for hours, if he wishes it.\r\n\r\nBesides the hospitals, I also go occasionally on long tours through the\r\ncamps, talking with the men, &c. Sometimes at night among the groups\r\naround the fires, in their shebang enclosures of bushes. These are\r\ncurious shows, full of characters and groups. I soon get acquainted\r\nanywhere in camp, with officers or men, and am always well used.\r\nSometimes I go down on picket with the regiments I know best. As to\r\nrations, the army here at present seems to be tolerably well supplied,\r\nand the men have enough, such as it is, mainly salt pork and hard tack.\r\nMost of the regiments lodge in the flimsy little shelter-tents. A few\r\nhave built themselves huts of logs and mud, with fire-places.\r\n\r\n\r\nBACK TO WASHINGTON\r\n\r\n_January, '63_.--Left camp at Falmouth, with some wounded, a few days\r\nsince, and came here by Aquia creek railroad, and so on government\r\nsteamer up the Potomac. Many wounded were with us on the cars and boat.\r\nThe cars were just common platform ones. The railroad journey of ten or\r\ntwelve miles was made mostly before sunrise. The soldiers guarding the\r\nroad came out from their tents or shebangs of bushes with rumpled hair\r\nand half-awake look. Those on duty were walking their posts, some on\r\nbanks over us, others down far below the level of the track. I saw\r\nlarge cavalry camps off the road. At Aquia creek landing were numbers\r\nof wounded going north. While I waited some three hours, I went around\r\namong them. Several wanted word sent home to parents, brothers, wives,\r\n&c., which I did for them, (by mail the next day from Washington.) On\r\nthe boat I had my hands full. One poor fellow died going up.\r\n\r\nI am now remaining in and around Washington, daily visiting the\r\nhospitals. Am much in Patent-office, Eighth street, H street,\r\nArmory-square, and others. Am now able to do a little good, having\r\nmoney, (as almoner of others home,) and getting experience. To-day,\r\nSunday afternoon and till nine in the evening, visited Campbell\r\nhospital; attended specially to one case in ward I, very sick with\r\npleurisy and typhoid fever, young man, farmer's son, D. F. Russell,\r\ncompany E, 60th New York, downhearted and feeble; a long time before he\r\nwould take any interest; wrote a letter home to his mother, in Malone,\r\nFranklin county, N. Y., at his request; gave him some fruit and one\r\nor two other gifts; envelop'd and directed his letter, &c. Then went\r\nthoroughly through ward 6, observ'd every case in the ward, without, I\r\nthink, missing one; gave perhaps from twenty to thirty persons, each one\r\nsome little gift, such as oranges, apples, sweet crackers, figs, &c.\r\n\r\n_Thursday, Jan. 21._--Devoted the main part of the day to Armory-square\r\nhospital; went pretty thoroughly through wards F, G, H, and I; some\r\nfifty cases in each ward. In ward F supplied the men throughout with\r\nwriting paper and stamp'd envelope each; distributed in small portions,\r\nto proper subjects, a large jar of first-rate preserv'd berries, which\r\nhad been donated to me by a lady--her own cooking. Found several cases\r\nI thought good subjects for small sums of money, which I furnish'd. (The\r\nwounded men often come up broke, and it helps their spirits to have\r\neven the small sum I give them.) My paper and envelopes all gone, but\r\ndistributed a good lot of amusing reading matter; also, as I thought\r\njudicious, tobacco, oranges, apples, &c. Interesting cases in ward I;\r\nCharles Miller, bed 19, company D, 53d Pennsylvania, is only 16 years\r\nof age, very bright, courageous boy, left leg amputated below the knee;\r\nnext bed to him, another young lad very sick; gave each appropriate\r\ngifts. In the bed above, also, amputation of the left leg; gave him a\r\nlittle jar of raspberries; bed J, this ward, gave a small sum; also to\r\na soldier on crutches, sitting on his bed near.... (I am more and more\r\nsurprised at the very great proportion of youngsters from fifteen to\r\ntwenty-one in the army. I afterwards found a still greater proportion\r\namong the southerners.)\r\n\r\nEvening, same day, went to see D. F. R., before alluded to; found him\r\nremarkably changed for the better; up and dress'd--quite a triumph; he\r\nafterwards got well, and went back to his regiment.\r\n\r\nDistributed in the wards a quantity of note-paper, and forty or fifty\r\nstamp'd envelopes, of which I had recruited my stock, and the men were\r\nmuch in need.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTY HOURS LEFT WOUNDED ON THE FIELD\r\n\r\nHere is a case of a soldier I found among the crowded cots in the\r\nPatent-office. He likes to have some one to talk to, and we will listen\r\nto him. He got badly hit in his leg and side at Fredericksburgh that\r\neventful Saturday, 13th of December. He lay the succeeding two days and\r\nnights helpless on the field, between the city and those grim terraces\r\nof batteries; his company and regiment had been compell'd to leave him\r\nto his fate. To make matters worse, it happen'd he lay with his head\r\nslightly down hill, and could not help himself. At the end of some fifty\r\nhours he was brought off, with other wounded, under a flag of truce. I\r\nask him how the rebels treated him as he lay during those two days and\r\nnights within reach of them--whether they came to him--whether they\r\nabused him? He answers that several of the rebels, soldiers and\r\nothers, came to him at one time and another. A couple of them, who\r\nwere together, spoke roughly and sarcastically, but nothing worse. One\r\nmiddle-aged man, however, who seem'd to be moving around the field,\r\namong the dead and wounded, for benevolent purposes, came to him in\r\na way he will never forget; treated our soldier kindly, bound up his\r\nwounds, cheer'd him, gave him a couple of biscuits and a drink of\r\nwhiskey and water; asked him if he could eat some beef. This good\r\nsecesh, however, did not change our soldier's position, for it might\r\nhave caused the blood to burst from the wounds, clotted and stagnated.\r\nOur soldier is from Pennsylvania; has had a pretty severe time; the\r\nwounds proved to be bad ones. But he retains a good heart, and is at\r\npresent on the gain. (It is not uncommon for the men to remain on the\r\nfield this way, one, two, or even four or five days.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHOSPITAL SCENES AND PERSONS\r\n\r\n_Letter Writing_.--When eligible, I encourage the men to write, and\r\nmyself, when called upon, write all sorts of letters for them (including\r\nlove letters, very tender ones.) Almost as I reel off these memoranda, I\r\nwrite for a new patient to his wife. M. de F., of the 17th Connecticut,\r\ncompany H, has just come up (February 17th) from Windmill point, and is\r\nreceived in ward H, Armory-square. He is an intelligent looking man, has\r\na foreign accent, black-eyed and hair'd, a Hebraic appearance. Wants a\r\ntelegraphic message sent to his wife, New Canaan, Conn. I agree to send\r\nthe message--but to make things sure I also sit down and write the wife\r\na letter, and despatch it to the post-office immediately, as he fears\r\nshe will come on, and he does not wish her to, as he will surely get\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n_Saturday, January 30th._--Afternoon, visited Campbell hospital. Scene\r\nof cleaning up the ward, and giving the men all clean clothes--through\r\nthe ward (6) the patients dressing or being dress'd--the naked upper\r\nhalf of the bodies--the good-humor and fun--the shirts, drawers, sheets\r\nof beds, &c., and the general fixing up for Sunday. Gave J. L. 50 cents.\r\n\r\n_Wednesday, February 4th._--Visited Armory-square hospital, went pretty\r\nthoroughly through wards E and D. Supplied paper and envelopes to all\r\nwho wish'd--as usual, found plenty of men who needed those articles.\r\nWrote letters. Saw and talk'd with two or three members of the Brooklyn\r\n14th regt. A poor fellow in ward D, with a fearful wound in a fearful\r\ncondition, was having some loose splinters of bone taken from the\r\nneighborhood of the wound. The operation was long, and one of great\r\npain--yet, after it was well commenced, the soldier bore it in silence.\r\nHe sat up, propp'd--was much wasted--had lain a long time quiet in one\r\nposition (not for days only but weeks,) a bloodless, brown-skinn'd face,\r\nwith eyes full of determination--belong'd to a New York regiment. There\r\nwas an unusual cluster of surgeons, medical cadets, nurses, &c., around\r\nhis bed--I thought the whole thing was done with tenderness, and done\r\nwell. In one case, the wife sat by the side of her husband, his sickness\r\ntyphoid fever, pretty bad. In another, by the side of her son, a\r\nmother--she told me she had seven children, and this was the youngest.\r\n(A fine, kind, healthy, gentle mother, good-looking, not very old, with\r\na cap on her head, and dress'd like home--what a charm it gave to the\r\nwhole ward.) I liked the woman nurse in ward E--I noticed how she sat\r\na long time by a poor fellow who just had, that morning, in addition to\r\nhis other sickness, bad hemorrhage--she gently assisted him, reliev'd\r\nhim of the blood, holding a cloth to his mouth, as he coughed it up--he\r\nwas so weak he could only just turn his head over on the pillow.\r\n\r\nOne young New York man, with a bright, handsome face, had been lying\r\nseveral months from a most disagreeable wound, receiv'd at Bull Run. A\r\nbullet had shot him right through the bladder, hitting him front, low in\r\nthe belly, and coming out back. He had suffer'd much--the water came out\r\nof the wound, by slow but steady quantities, for many weeks--so that\r\nhe lay almost constantly in a sort of puddle--and there were other\r\ndisagreeable circumstances. He was of good heart, however. At present\r\ncomparatively comfortable, had a bad throat, was delighted with a stick\r\nof horehound candy I gave him, with one or two other trifles.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATENT-OFFICE HOSPITAL\r\n\r\n_February 23._--I must not let the great hospital at the Patent-office\r\npass away without some mention. A few weeks ago the vast area of the\r\nsecond story of that noblest of Washington buildings was crowded close\r\nwith rows of sick, badly wounded and dying soldiers. They were placed in\r\nthree very large apartments. I went there many times. It was a strange,\r\nsolemn, and, with all its features of suffering and death, a sort\r\nof fascinating sight. I go sometimes at night to soothe and relieve\r\nparticular cases. Two of the immense apartments are fill'd with high and\r\nponderous glass cases, crowded with models in miniature of every kind of\r\nutensil, machine or invention, it ever enter'd into the mind of man to\r\nconceive; and with curiosities and foreign presents. Between these cases\r\nare lateral openings, perhaps eight feet wide and quite deep, and in\r\nthese were placed the sick, besides a great long double row of them\r\nup and down through the middle of the hall. Many of them were very bad\r\ncases, wounds and amputations. Then there was a gallery running above\r\nthe hall in which there were beds also. It was, indeed, a curious scene,\r\nespecially at night when lit up. The glass cases, the beds, the forms\r\nlying there, the gallery above, and the marble pavement under\r\nfoot--the suffering, and the fortitude to bear it in various\r\ndegrees--occasionally, from some, the groan that could not be\r\nrepress'd--sometimes a poor fellow dying, with emaciated face and glassy\r\neye, the nurse by his side, the doctor also there, but no friend, no\r\nrelative--such were the sights but lately in the Patent-office. (The\r\nwounded have since been removed from there, and it is now vacant again.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE HOUSE BY MOONLIGHT\r\n\r\n_February 24th._--A spell of fine soft weather. I wander about a good\r\ndeal, sometimes at night under the moon. Tonight took a long look at\r\nthe President's house. The white portico--the palace-like, tall,\r\nround columns, spotless as snow--the walls also--the tender and\r\nsoft moonlight, flooding the pale marble, and making peculiar faint\r\nlanguishing shades, not shadows--everywhere a soft transparent\r\nhazy, thin, blue moon-lace, hanging in the air--the brilliant and\r\nextra-plentiful clusters of gas, on and around the façade, columns,\r\nportico, &c.--everything so white, so marbly pure and dazzling, yet\r\nsoft--the White House of future poems, and of dreams and dramas, there\r\nin the soft and copious moon--the gorgeous front, in the trees, under\r\nthe lustrous flooding moon, full of realty, full of illusion--the forms\r\nof the trees, leafless, silent, in trunk and myriad--angles of branches,\r\nunder the stars and sky--the White House of the land, and of beauty and\r\nnight--sentries at the gates, and by the portico, silent, pacing there\r\nin blue overcoats--stopping you not at all, but eyeing you with sharp\r\neyes, whichever way you move.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ARMY HOSPITAL WARD\r\n\r\nLet me specialize a visit I made to the collection of barrack-like\r\none-story edifices, Campbell hospital, out on the flats, at the end\r\nof the then horse railway route, on Seventh street. There is a long\r\nbuilding appropriated to each ward. Let us go into ward 6. It contains,\r\nto-day, I should judge, eighty or a hundred patients, half sick, half\r\nwounded. The edifice is nothing but boards, well whitewash'd inside, and\r\nthe usual slender-framed iron bedsteads, narrow and plain. You walk down\r\nthe central passage, with a row on either side, their feet towards you,\r\nand their heads to the wall. There are fires in large stoves, and the\r\nprevailing white of the walls is reliev'd by some ornaments, stars,\r\ncircles, &c., made of evergreens. The view of the whole edifice and\r\noccupants can be taken at once, for there is no partition. You may hear\r\ngroans or other sounds of unendurable suffering from two or three of\r\nthe cots, but in the main there is quiet--almost a painful absence of\r\ndemonstration; but the pallid face, the dull'd eye, and the moisture\r\nof the lip, are demonstration enough. Most of these sick or hurt are\r\nevidently young fellows from the country, farmers' sons, and such like.\r\nLook at the fine large frames, the bright and broad countenances, and\r\nthe many yet lingering proofs of strong constitution and physique. Look\r\nat the patient and mute manner of our American wounded as they lie in\r\nsuch a sad collection; representatives from all New England, and from\r\nNew York, and New Jersey, and Pennsylvania--indeed from all the States\r\nand all the cities--largely from the west. Most of them are entirely\r\nwithout friends or acquaintances here--no familiar face, and hardly a\r\nword of judicious sympathy or cheer, through their sometimes long and\r\ntedious sickness, or the pangs of aggravated wounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CONNECTICUT CASE\r\n\r\nThis young man in bed 25 is H. D. B. of the 27th Connecticut, company\r\nB. His folks live at Northford, near New Haven. Though not more than\r\ntwenty-one, or thereabouts, he has knock'd much around the world, on sea\r\nand land, and has seen some fighting on both. When I first saw him he\r\nwas very sick, with no appetite. He declined offers of money--said\r\nhe did not need anything. As I was quite anxious to do something,\r\nhe confess'd that he had a hankering for a good home-made rice\r\npudding--thought he could relish it better than anything. At this\r\ntime his stomach was very weak. (The doctor, whom I consulted, said\r\nnourishment would do him more good than anything; but things in the\r\nhospital, though better than usual, revolted him.) I soon procured B.\r\nhis rice pudding. A Washington lady, (Mrs. O'C.), hearing his wish,\r\nmade the pudding herself, and I took it up to him the next day. He\r\nsubsequently told me he lived upon it for three or four days. This B. is\r\na good sample of the American eastern young man--the typical Yankee.\r\nI took a fancy to him, and gave him a nice pipe for a keepsake. He\r\nreceiv'd afterwards a box of things from home, and nothing would do but\r\nI must take dinner with him, which I did, and a very good one it was.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO BROOKLYN BOYS\r\n\r\nHere in this same ward are two young men from Brooklyn, members of the\r\n51st New York. I had known both the two as young lads at home, so they\r\nseem near to me. One of them, J. L., lies there with an amputated\r\narm, the stump healing pretty well. (I saw him lying on the ground at\r\nFredericksburgh last December, all bloody, just after the arm was taken\r\noff. He was very phlegmatic about it, munching away at a cracker in the\r\nremaining hand--made no fuss.) He will recover, and thinks and talks yet\r\nof meeting Johnny Rebs.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SECESH BRAVE\r\n\r\nThe grand soldiers are not comprised in those of one side, any more\r\nthan the other. Here is a sample of an unknown southerner, a lad\r\nof seventeen. At the War department, a few days ago, I witness'd a\r\npresentation of captured flags to the Secretary. Among others a soldier\r\nnamed Gant, of the 104th Ohio volunteers, presented a rebel battle-flag,\r\nwhich one of the officers stated to me was borne to the mouth of our\r\ncannon and planted there by a boy but seventeen years of age, who\r\nactually endeavor'd to stop the muzzle of the gun with fence-rails. He\r\nwas kill'd in the effort, and the flag-staff was sever'd by a shot from\r\none of our men.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOUNDED FROM CHANCELLORSVILLE\r\n\r\n_May '63_.--As I write this, the wounded have begun to arrive from\r\nHooker's command from bloody Chancellorsville. I was down among the\r\nfirst arrivals. The men in charge told me the bad cases were yet to\r\ncome. If that is so I pity them, for these are bad enough. You ought to\r\nsee the scene of the wounded arriving at the landing here at the foot of\r\nSixth street, at night. Two boat loads came about half-past seven last\r\nnight. A little after eight it rain'd a long and violent shower. The\r\npale, helpless soldiers had been debark'd, and lay around on the wharf\r\nand neighborhood anywhere. The rain was, probably, grateful to them;\r\nat any rate they were exposed to it. The few torches light up the\r\nspectacle. All around--on the wharf, on the ground, out on side\r\nplaces--the men are lying on blankets, old quilts, &c., with bloody rags\r\nbound round heads, arms, and legs. The attendants are few, and at\r\nnight few outsiders also--only a few hard-work'd transportation men\r\nand drivers. (The wounded are getting to be common, and people grow\r\ncallous.) The men, whatever their condition, lie there, and patiently\r\nwait till their turn comes to be taken up. Near by, the ambulances are\r\nnow arriving in clusters, and one after another is call'd to back up\r\nand take its load. Extreme cases are sent off on stretchers. The men\r\ngenerally make little or no ado, whatever their sufferings. A few groans\r\nthat cannot be suppress'd, and occasionally a scream of pain as they\r\nlift a man into the ambulance. To-day, as I write, hundreds more are\r\nexpected, and to-morrow and the next day more, and so on for many days.\r\nQuite often they arrive at the rate of 1000 a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NIGHT BATTLE OVER A WEEK SINCE\r\n\r\n_May 12_.--There was part of the late battle at Chancellorsville,\r\n(second Fredericksburgh,) a little over a week ago, Saturday, Saturday\r\nnight and Sunday, under Gen. Joe Hooker, I would like to give just a\r\nglimpse of--(a moment's look in a terrible storm at sea--of which a few\r\nsuggestions are enough, and full details impossible.) The fighting had\r\nbeen very hot during the day, and after an intermission the latter part,\r\nwas resumed at night, and kept up with furious energy till 3 o'clock in\r\nthe morning. That afternoon (Saturday) an attack sudden and strong by\r\nStonewall Jackson had gain'd a great advantage to the southern army, and\r\nbroken our lines, entering us like a wedge, and leaving things in that\r\nposition at dark. But Hooker at 11 at night made a desperate push, drove\r\nthe secesh forces back, restored his original lines, and resumed his\r\nplans. This night scrimmage was very exciting, and afforded countless\r\nstrange and fearful pictures. The fighting had been general both at\r\nChancellorsville and northeast at Fredericksburgh. (We hear of some poor\r\nfighting, episodes, skedaddling on our part. I think not of it. I\r\nthink of the fierce bravery, the general rule.) One corps, the 6th,\r\nSedgewick's, fights four dashing and bloody battles in thirty-six hours,\r\nretreating in great jeopardy, losing largely but maintaining itself,\r\nfighting with the sternest desperation under all circumstances, getting\r\nover the Rappahannock only by the skin of its teeth, yet getting over.\r\nIt lost many, many brave men, yet it took vengeance, ample vengeance.\r\n\r\nBut it was the tug of Saturday evening, and through the night and Sunday\r\nmorning, I wanted to make a special note of. It was largely in the\r\nwoods, and quite a general engagement. The night was very pleasant, at\r\ntimes the moon shining out full and clear, all Nature so calm in itself,\r\nthe early summer grass so rich, and foliage of the trees--yet there the\r\nbattle raging, and many good fellows lying helpless, with new accessions\r\nto them, and every minute amid the rattle of muskets and crash of\r\ncannon, (for there was an artillery contest too,) the red life-blood\r\noozing out from heads or trunks or limbs upon that green and dew-cool\r\ngrass. Patches of the woods take fire, and several of the wounded,\r\nunable to move, are consumed--quite large spaces are swept over, burning\r\nthe dead also--some of the men have their hair and beards singed--some,\r\nburns on their faces and hands--others holes burnt in their clothing.\r\nThe flashes of fire from the cannon, the quick flaring flames and smoke,\r\nand the immense roar--the musketry so general, the light nearly bright\r\nenough for each side to see the other--the crashing, tramping of\r\nmen--the yelling--close quarters--we hear the secesh yells--our men\r\ncheer loudly back, especially if Hooker is in sight--hand to hand\r\nconflicts, each side stands up to it, brave, determin'd as demons, they\r\noften charge upon us--a thousand deeds are done worth to write newer\r\ngreater poems on--and still the woods on fire--still many are not only\r\nscorch'd--too many, unable to move, are burned to death.\r\n\r\nThen the camps of the wounded--O heavens, what scene is this?--is this\r\nindeed _humanity_--these butchers' shambles? There are several of them.\r\nThere they lie, in the largest, in an open space in the woods, from 200\r\nto 300 poor fellows--the groans and screams--the odor of blood,\r\nmixed with the fresh scent of the night, the grass, the trees--that\r\nslaughter-house! O well is it their mothers, their sisters cannot see\r\nthem--cannot conceive, and never conceiv'd, these things. One man is\r\nshot by a shell, both in the arm and leg--both are amputated--there\r\nlie the rejected members. Some have their legs blown off--some bullets\r\nthrough the breast--some indescribably horrid wounds in the face\r\nor head, all mutilated, sickening, torn, gouged out--some in the\r\nabdomen--some mere boys--many rebels, badly hurt--they take their\r\nregular turns with the rest, just the same as any--the surgeons use\r\nthem just the same. Such is the camp of the wounded--such a fragment, a\r\nreflection afar off of the bloody scene--while all over the clear, large\r\nmoon comes out at times softly, quietly shining. Amid the woods,\r\nthat scene of flitting souls--amid the crack and crash and yelling\r\nsounds--the impalpable perfume of the woods--and yet the pungent,\r\nstifling smoke--the radiance of the moon, looking from heaven at\r\nintervals so placid--the sky so heavenly the clear-obscure up there,\r\nthose buoyant upper oceans--a few large placid stars beyond, coming\r\nsilently and languidly out, and then disappearing--the melancholy,\r\ndraperied night above, around. And there, upon the roads, the fields,\r\nand in those woods, that contest, never one more desperate in any age or\r\nland--both parties now in force--masses--no fancy battle, no semi-play,\r\nbut fierce and savage demons fighting there--courage and scorn of death\r\nthe rule, exceptions almost none.\r\n\r\nWhat history, I say, can ever give--for who can know--the mad,\r\ndetermin'd tussle of the armies, in all their separate large and little\r\nsquads--as this--each steep'd from crown to toe in desperate, mortal\r\npurports? Who know the conflict, hand-to-hand--the many conflicts in\r\nthe dark, those shadowy-tangled, flashing moonbeam'd woods--the\r\nwrithing groups and squads--the cries, the din, the cracking guns and\r\npistols--the distant cannon--the cheers and calls and threats and\r\nawful music of the oaths--the indescribable mix--the officers'\r\norders, persuasions, encouragements--the devils fully rous'd in human\r\nhearts--the strong shout, _Charge, men, charge_--the flash of the naked\r\nsword, and rolling flame and smoke? And still the broken, clear and\r\nclouded heaven--and still again the moonlight pouring silvery soft its\r\nradiant patches over all. Who paint the scene, the sudden partial panic\r\nof the afternoon, at dusk? Who paint the irrepressible advance of the\r\nsecond division of the Third corps, under Hooker himself, suddenly\r\norder'd up--those rapid-filing phantoms through the woods? Who show what\r\nmoves there in the shadows, fluid and firm--to save, (and it did save,)\r\nthe army's name, perhaps the nation? as there the veterans hold the\r\nfield. (Brave Berry falls not yet--but death has mark'd him--soon he\r\nfalls.)\r\n\r\n\r\nUNNAMED REMAINS THE BRAVEST SOLDIER\r\n\r\nOf scenes like these, I say, who writes--whoe'er can write the story? Of\r\nmany a score--aye, thousands, north and south, of unwrit heroes, unknown\r\nheroisms, incredible, impromptu, first-class desperations--who tells?\r\nNo history ever--no poem sings, no music sounds, those bravest men of\r\nall--those deeds. No formal general's report, nor book in the library,\r\nnorcolumn in the paper, embalms the bravest, north or south, east or\r\nwest. Unnamed, unknown, remain, and still remain, the bravest soldiers.\r\nOur manliest--our boys--our hardy darlings; no picture gives them.\r\nLikely, the typic one of them (standing, no doubt, for hundreds,\r\nthousands,) crawls aside to some bush-clump, or ferny tuft, on receiving\r\nhis death-shot--there sheltering a little while, soaking roots, grass\r\nand soil, with red blood--the battle advances, retreats, flits from the\r\nscene, sweeps by--and there, haply with pain and suffering (yet less,\r\nfar less, than is supposed,) the last lethargy winds like a serpent\r\nround him--the eyes glaze in death----none recks--perhaps the\r\nburial-squads, in truce, a week afterwards, search not the secluded\r\nspot--and there, at last, the Bravest Soldier crumbles in mother earth,\r\nunburied and unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME SPECIMEN CASES\r\n\r\n_June 18th_.--In one of the hospitals I find Thomas Haley, company M,\r\n4th New York cavalry--a regular Irish boy, a fine specimen of youthful\r\nphysical manliness--shot through the lungs--inevitably dying--came\r\nover to this country from Ireland to enlist--has not a single friend or\r\nacquaintance here--is sleeping soundly at this moment, (but it is the\r\nsleep of death)--has a bullet-hole straight through the lung. I saw Tom\r\nwhen first brought here, three days since, and didn't suppose he could\r\nlive twelve hours--(yet he looks well enough in the face to a casual\r\nobserver.) He lies there with his frame exposed above the waist, all\r\nnaked, for coolness, a fine built man, the tan not yet bleach'd from his\r\ncheeks and neck. It is useless to talk to him, as with his sad hurt, and\r\nthe stimulants they give him, and the utter strangeness of every object,\r\nface, furniture, &c., the poor fellow, even when awake, is like some\r\nfrighten'd, shy animal. Much of the time he sleeps, or half sleeps.\r\n(Sometimes I thought he knew more than he show'd.) I often come and sit\r\nby him in perfect silence; he will breathe for ten minutes as softly and\r\nevenly as a young babe asleep. Poor youth, so handsome, athletic, with\r\nprofuse beautiful shining hair. One time as I sat looking at him while\r\nhe lay asleep, he suddenly, without the least start, awaken'd, open'd\r\nhis eyes, gave me a long steady look, turning his face very slightly to\r\ngaze easier--one long, clear, silent look--a slight sigh--then turn'd\r\nback and went into his doze again. Little he knew, poor death-stricken\r\nboy, the heart of the stranger that hover'd near.\r\n\r\n_W.H.E., Co. F, 2nd N.Y._--His disease is pneumonia. He lay sick at\r\nthe wretched hospital below Aquia creek, for seven or eight days before\r\nbrought here. He was detail'd from his regiment to go there and help\r\nas nurse, but was soon taken down himself. Is an elderly, sallow-faced,\r\nrather gaunt, gray-hair'd man, a widower, with children. He express'd a\r\ngreat desire for good, strong green tea. An excellent lady, Mrs. W.,\r\nof Washington, soon sent him a package; also a small sum of money. The\r\ndoctor said give him the tea at pleasure; it lay on the table by his\r\nside, and he used it every day. He slept a great deal; could not talk\r\nmuch, as he grew deaf. Occupied bed 15, ward I, Armory. (The same lady\r\nabove, Mrs. W., sent the men a large package of tobacco.)\r\n\r\nJ. G. lies in bed 52, ward I; is of company B, 7th Pennsylvania. I\r\ngave him a small sum of money, some tobacco, and envelopes. To a man\r\nadjoining also gave twenty-five cents; he flush'd in the face when I\r\noffer'd it--refused at first, but as I found he had not a cent, and was\r\nvery fond of having the daily papers to read, I prest it on him. He was\r\nevidently very grateful, but said little.\r\n\r\nJ.T.L., of company F, 9th New Hampshire, lies in bed 37, ward I. Is\r\nvery fond of tobacco. I furnish him some; also with a little money. Has\r\ngangrene of the feet; a pretty bad case; will surely have to lose three\r\ntoes. Is a regular specimen of an old-fashion'd, rude, hearty, New\r\nEngland countryman, impressing me with his likeness to that celebrated\r\nsinged cat, who was better than she look'd.\r\n\r\nBed 3, ward E, Armory, has a great hankering for pickles, something\r\npungent. After consulting the doctor, I gave him a small bottle of\r\nhorse-radish; also some apples; also a book. Some of the nurses\r\nare excellent. The woman-nurse in this ward I like very much. (Mrs.\r\nWright--a year afterwards I found her in Mansion house hospital,\r\nAlexandria--she is a perfect nurse.)\r\n\r\nIn one bed a young man, Marcus Small, company K, 7th Maine--sick with\r\ndysentery and typhoid fever--pretty critical case--I talk with him\r\noften--he thinks he will die--looks like it indeed. I write a letter for\r\nhim home to East Livermore, Maine--I let him talk to me a little,\r\nbut not much, advise him to keep very quiet--do most of the talking\r\nmyself--stay quite a while with him, as he holds on to my hand--talk\r\nto him in a cheering, but slow, low and measured manner--talk about his\r\nfurlough, and going home as soon as he is able to travel.\r\n\r\nThomas Lindly, 1st Pennsylvania cavalry, shot very badly through the\r\nfoot--poor young man, he suffers horridly, has to be constantly dosed\r\nwith morphine, his face ashy and glazed, bright young eyes--I give him\r\na large handsome apple, lay it in sight, tell him to have it roasted\r\nin the morning, as he generally feels easier then, and can eat a little\r\nbreakfast. I write two letters for him.\r\n\r\nOpposite, an old Quaker lady sits by the side of her son, Amer Moore,\r\n2d U. S. artillery--shot in the head two weeks since, very low, quite\r\nrational--from hips down paralyzed--he will surely die. I speak a very\r\nfew words to him every day and evening--he answers pleasantly--wants\r\nnothing--(he told me soon after he came about his home affairs,\r\nhis mother had been an invalid, and he fear'd to let her know his\r\ncondition.) He died soon after she came.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY PREPARATIONS FOR VISITS\r\n\r\nIn my visits to the hospitals I found it was in the simple matter of\r\npersonal presence, and emanating ordinary cheer and magnetism, that I\r\nsucceeded and help'd more than by medical nursing, or delicacies,\r\nor gifts of money, or anything else. During the war I possess'd the\r\nperfection of physical health. My habit, when practicable, was to\r\nprepare for starting out on one of those daily or nightly tours of from\r\na couple to four or five hours, by fortifying myself with previous rest,\r\nthe bath, clean clothes, a good meal, and as cheerful an appearance as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMBULANCE PROCESSIONS\r\n\r\n_June 23, Sundown._--As I sit writing this paragraph I see a train of\r\nabout thirty huge four-horse wagons, used as ambulances, fill'd with\r\nwounded, passing up Fourteenth street, on their way, probably, to\r\nColumbian, Carver, and Mount Pleasant hospitals. This is the way the men\r\ncome in now, seldom in small numbers, but almost always in these long,\r\nsad processions. Through the past winter, while our army lay opposite\r\nFredericksburg, the like strings of ambulances were of frequent\r\noccurrence along Seventh street, passing slowly up from the steamboat\r\nwharf, with loads from Aquia creek.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAD WOUNDS--THE YOUNG\r\n\r\nThe soldiers are nearly all young men, and far more American than is\r\ngenerally supposed--I should say nine-tenths are native-born. Among\r\nthe arrivals from Chancellorsville I find a large proportion of Ohio,\r\nIndiana, and Illinois men. As usual, there are all sorts of wounds. Some\r\nof the men fearfully burnt from the explosions of artillery caissons.\r\nOne ward has a long row of officers, some with ugly hurts. Yesterday was\r\nperhaps worse than usual. Amputations are going on--the attendants are\r\ndressing wounds. As you pass by, you must be on your guard where\r\nyou look. I saw the other day a gentlemen, a visitor apparently from\r\ncuriosity, in one of the wards, stop and turn a moment to look at an\r\nawful wound they were probing. He turn'd pale, and in a moment more he\r\nhad fainted away and fallen to the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOST INSPIRITING OF ALL WAR'S SHOWS\r\n\r\n_June 29._--Just before sundown this evening a very large cavalry force\r\nwent by--a fine sight. The men evidently had seen service. First came a\r\nmounted band of sixteen bugles, drums and cymbals, playing wild martial\r\ntunes--made my heart jump. Then the principal officers, then company\r\nafter company, with their officers at their heads, making of course the\r\nmain part of the cavalcade; then a long train of men with led horses,\r\nlots of mounted negroes with special horses--and a long string of\r\nbaggage-wagons, each drawn by four horses--and then a motley rear guard.\r\n\r\nIt was a pronouncedly warlike and gay show; the sabres clank'd, the men\r\nlook'd young and healthy and strong; the electric tramping of so many\r\nhorses on the hard road, and the gallant bearing, fine seat, and bright\r\nfaced appearance of a thousand and more handsome young American men,\r\nwere so good to see. An hour later another troop went by, smaller in\r\nnumbers, perhaps three hundred men. They too look'd like serviceable\r\nmen, campaigners used to field and fight.\r\n\r\n_July 3_.--This forenoon, for more than an hour, again long strings\r\nof cavalry, several regiments, very fine men and horses, four or five\r\nabreast. I saw them in Fourteenth street, coming in town from north.\r\nSeveral hundred extra horses, some of the mares with colts, trotting\r\nalong. (Appear'd to be a number of prisoners too.) How inspiriting\r\nalways the cavalry regiments. Our men are generally well mounted, feel\r\ngood, are young, gay on the saddle, their blankets in a roll behind\r\nthem, their sabres clanking at their sides. This noise and movement\r\nand the tramp of many horses' hoofs has a curious effect upon one. The\r\nbugles play--presently you hear them afar off, deaden'd, mix'd with\r\nother noises. Then just as they had all pass'd, a string of ambulances\r\ncommenc'd from the other way, moving up Fourteenth street north, slowly\r\nwending along, bearing a large lot of wounded to the hospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE OF GETTYSBURG\r\n\r\n_July 4th_.--The weather to-day, upon the whole, is very fine, warm,\r\nbut from a smart rain last night, fresh enough, and no dust, which is\r\na great relief for this city. I saw the parade about noon, Pennsylvania\r\navenue, from Fifteenth street down toward the capitol. There were three\r\nregiments of infantry, (I suppose the ones doing patrol duty here,) two\r\nor three societies of Odd Fellows, a lot of children in barouches, and\r\na squad of policemen. (A useless imposition upon the soldiers--they have\r\nwork enough on their backs without piling the like of this.)\r\n\r\nAs I went down the Avenue, saw a big flaring placard on the bulletin\r\nboard of a newspaper office, announcing \"Glorious Victory for the Union\r\nArmy!\" Meade had fought Lee at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, yesterday and\r\nday before, and repuls'd him most signally, taken 3,000 prisoners, &c.\r\n(I afterwards saw Meade's despatch, very modest, and a sort of order of\r\nthe day from the President himself, quite religious, giving thanks to\r\nthe Supreme, and calling on the people to do the same.)\r\n\r\nI walk'd on to Armory hospital--took along with me several bottles of\r\nblackberry and cherry syrup, good and strong, but innocent. Went through\r\nseveral of the wards, announc'd to the soldiers the news from Meade,\r\nand gave them all a good drink of the syrups with ice water, quite\r\nrefreshing--prepar'd it all myself, and serv'd it around. Meanwhile the\r\nWashington bells are ringing their sun-down peals for Fourth of July,\r\nand the usual fusilades of boys' pistols, crackers, and guns.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CAVALRY CAMP\r\n\r\nI am writing this, nearly sundown, watching a cavalry company (acting\r\nSignal service,) just come in through a shower, making their night's\r\ncamp ready on some broad, vacant ground, a sort of hill, in full view\r\nopposite my window. There are the men in their yellow-striped jackets.\r\nAll are dismounted; the freed horses stand with drooping heads and wet\r\nsides; they are to be led off presently in groups, to water. The little\r\nwall-tents and shelter tents spring up quickly. I see the fires already\r\nblazing, and pots and kettles over them. Some among the men are driving\r\nin tent-poles, wielding their axes with strong, slow blows. I see great\r\nhuddles of horses, bundles of hay, groups of men (some with unbuckled\r\nsabres yet on their sides,) a few officers, piles of wood, the flames\r\nof the fires, saddles, harness, &c. The smoke streams upward, additional\r\nmen arrive and dismount--some drive in stakes, and tie their horses to\r\nthem; some go with buckets for water, some are chopping wood, and so on.\r\n\r\n_July 6th_.--A steady rain, dark and thick and warm. A train of six-mule\r\nwagons has just pass'd bearing pontoons, great square-end flatboats, and\r\nthe heavy planking for overlaying them. We hear that the Potomac above\r\nhere is flooded, and are wondering whether Lee will be able to get back\r\nacross again, or whether Meade will indeed break him to pieces. The\r\ncavalry camp on the hill is a ceaseless field of observation for me.\r\nThis forenoon there stand the horses, tether'd together, dripping,\r\nsteaming, chewing their hay. The men emerge from their tents, dripping\r\nalso. The fires are half quench'd.\r\n\r\n_July 10th_.--Still the camp opposite--perhaps fifty or sixty tents.\r\nSome of the men are cleaning their sabres (pleasant to-day,) some\r\nbrushing boots, some laying off, reading, writing--some cooking, some\r\nsleeping. On long temporary cross-sticks back of the tents are cavalry\r\naccoutrements--blankets and overcoats are hung out to air--there are the\r\nsquads of horses tether'd, feeding, continually stamping and whisking\r\ntheir tails to keep off flies. I sit long in my third story window and\r\nlook at the scene--a hundred little things going on--peculiar objects\r\nconnected with the camp that could not be described, any one of them\r\njustly, without much minute drawing and coloring in words.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW YORK SOLDIER\r\n\r\nThis afternoon, July 22d, I have spent a long time with Oscar F. Wilber,\r\ncompany G, 154th New York, low with chronic diarrhoea, and a bad\r\nwound also. He asked me to read him a chapter in the New Testament.\r\nI complied, and ask'd him what I should read. He said, \"Make your\r\nown choice.\" I open'd at the close of one of the first books of the\r\nevangelists, and read the chapters describing the latter hours of\r\nChrist, and the scenes at the crucifixion. The poor, wasted young man\r\nask'd me to read the following chapter also, how Christ rose again. I\r\nread very slowly, for Oscar was feeble. It pleased him very much, yet\r\nthe tears were in his eyes. He ask'd me if I enjoy'd religion. I said,\r\n\"Perhaps not, my dear, in the way you mean, and yet, may-be, it is the\r\nsame thing.\" He said, \"It is my chief reliance.\" He talk'd of death, and\r\nsaid he did not fear it. I said, \"Why, Oscar, don't you think you will\r\nget well?\" He said, \"I may, but it is not probable.\" He spoke calmly\r\nof his condition. The wound was very bad, it discharg'd much. Then the\r\ndiarrhoea had prostrated him, and I felt that he was even then the same\r\nas dying. He behaved very manly and affectionate. The kiss I gave him\r\nas I was about leaving he return'd fourfold. He gave me his mother's\r\naddress, Mrs. Sally D. Wilber, Alleghany pest-office, Cattaraugus\r\ncounty, N. Y. I had several such interviews with him. He died a few days\r\nafter the one just described.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOME-MADE MUSIC\r\n\r\n_August 8th_.--To-night, as I was trying to keep cool, sitting by a\r\nwounded soldier in Armory-square, I was attracted by some pleasant\r\nsinging in an adjoining ward. As my soldier was asleep, I left him, and\r\nentering the ward where the music was, I walk'd halfway down and took a\r\nseat by the cot of a young Brooklyn friend, S. R., badly wounded in the\r\nhand at Chancellorsville, and who has suffer'd much, but at that moment\r\nin the evening was wide awake and comparatively easy. He had turn'd\r\nover on his left side to get a better view of the singers, but the\r\nmosquito-curtains of the adjoining cots obstructed the sight. I stept\r\nround and loop'd them all up, so that he had a clear show, and then sat\r\ndown again by him, and look'd and listen'd. The principal singer was a\r\nyoung lady-nurse of one of the wards, accompanying on a melodeon, and\r\njoin'd by the lady-nurses of other wards. They sat there, making a\r\ncharming group, with their handsome, healthy faces, and standing up\r\na little behind them were some ten or fifteen of the convalescent\r\nsoldiers, young men, nurses, &c., with books in their hands, singing.\r\nOf course it was not such a performance as the great soloists at the\r\nNew York opera house take a hand in, yet I am not sure but I receiv'd as\r\nmuch pleasure under the circumstances, sitting there, as I have had from\r\nthe best Italian compositions, express'd by world-famous performers.\r\nThe men lying up and down the hospital, in their cots, (some badly\r\nwounded--some never to rise thence,) the cots themselves, with their\r\ndrapery of white curtains, and the shadows down the lower and upper\r\nparts of the ward; then the silence of the men, and the attitudes they\r\ntook--the whole was a sight to look around upon again and again. And\r\nthere sweetly rose those voices up to the high, whitewash'd wooden roof,\r\nand pleasantly the roof sent it all back again. They sang very well,\r\nmostly quaint old songs and declamatory hymns, to fitting tunes. Here,\r\nfor instance:\r\n\r\n    My days are swiftly gliding by, and I a pilgrim stranger,\r\n    Would not detain them as they fly, those hours of toil and danger;\r\n    For O we stand on Jordan's strand, our friends are passing over,\r\n    And just before, the shining shore we may almost discover.\r\n    We'll gird our loins my brethren dear, our distant home discerning,\r\n    Our absent Lord has left us word, let every lamp be burning,\r\n    For O we stand on Jordan's strand, our friends are passing over,\r\n    And just before, the shining shore we may almost discover.\r\n\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN\r\n\r\n_August 12th_.--I see the President almost every day, as I happen to\r\nlive where he passes to or from his lodgings out of town. He never\r\nsleeps at the White House during the hot season, but has quarters at a\r\nhealthy location some three miles north of the city, the Soldiers' home,\r\na United States military establishment. I saw him this morning about 8\r\n1/2 coming in to business, riding on Vermont avenue, near L street. He\r\nalways has a company of twenty-five or thirty cavalry, with sabres drawn\r\nand held upright over their shoulders. They say this guard was against\r\nhis personal wish, but he let his counselors have their way. The party\r\nmakes no great show in uniform or horses. Mr. Lincoln on the saddle\r\ngenerally rides a good-sized, easy-going gray horse, is dress'd in plain\r\nblack, somewhat rusty and dusty, wears a black stiff hat, and looks\r\nabout as ordinary in attire, &c., as the commonest man. A lieutenant,\r\nwith yellow straps, rides at his left, and following behind, two by\r\ntwo, come the cavalry men, in their yellow-striped jackets. They are\r\ngenerally going at a slow trot, as that is the pace set them by the one\r\nthey wait upon. The sabres and accoutrements clank, and the entirely\r\nunornamental _cortège_ as it trots towards Lafayette square arouses\r\nno sensation, only some curious stranger stops and gazes. I see very\r\nplainly ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S dark brown face, with the deep-cut lines, the\r\neyes, always to me with a deep latent sadness in the expression. We\r\nhave got so that we exchange bows, and very cordial ones. Sometimes\r\nthe President goes and comes in an open barouche. The cavalry always\r\naccompany him, with drawn sabres. Often I notice as he goes out\r\nevenings--and sometimes in the morning, when he returns early--he turns\r\noff and halts at the large and handsome residence of the Secretary of\r\nWar, on K street, and holds conference there. If in his barouche, I can\r\nsee from my window he does not alight, but sits in his vehicle, and Mr.\r\nStanton comes out to attend him. Sometimes one of his sons, a boy of ten\r\nor twelve, accompanies him, riding at his right on a pony. Earlier in\r\nthe summer I occasionally saw the President and his wife, toward the\r\nlatter part of the afternoon, out in a barouche, on a pleasure ride\r\nthrough the city. Mrs. Lincoln was dress'd in complete black, with a\r\nlong crape veil. The equipage is of the plainest kind, only two horses,\r\nand they nothing extra. They pass'd me once very close, and I saw the\r\nPresident in the face fully, as they were moving slowly, and his look,\r\nthough abstracted, happen'd to be directed steadily in my eye. He bow'd\r\nand smiled, but far beneath his smile I noticed well the expression I\r\nhave alluded to. None of the artists or pictures has caught the deep,\r\nthough subtle and indirect expression of this man's face. There is\r\nsomething else there. One of the great portrait painters of two or three\r\ncenturies ago is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEATED TERM\r\n\r\nThere has lately been much suffering here from heat; we have had it upon\r\nus now eleven days. I go around with an umbrella and a fan. I saw two\r\ncases of sun-stroke yesterday, one in Pennsylvania avenue, and another\r\nin Seventh street. The City railroad company loses some horses every\r\nday. Yet Washington is having a livelier August, and is probably putting\r\nin a more energetic and satisfactory summer, than ever before during its\r\nexistence. There is probably more human electricity, more population to\r\nmake it, more business, more light-heartedness, than ever before.\r\nThe armies that swiftly circumambiated from Fredericksburgh--march'd,\r\nstruggled, fought, had out their mighty clinch and hurl at\r\nGettysburg--wheel'd, circumambiated again, return'd to their ways,\r\ntouching us not, either at their going or coming. And Washington feels\r\nthat she has pass'd the worst; perhaps feels that she is henceforth\r\nmistress. So here she sits with her surrounding hills spotted with guns,\r\nand is conscious of a character and identity different from what it\r\nwas five or six short weeks ago, and very considerably pleasanter and\r\nprouder.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLDIERS AND TALKS\r\n\r\nSoldiers, soldiers, soldiers, you meet everywhere about the city,\r\noften superb-looking men, though invalids dress'd in worn uniforms, and\r\ncarrying canes or crutches. I often have talks with them, occasionally\r\nquite long and interesting. One, for instance, will have been all\r\nthrough the peninsula under McClellan--narrates to me the fights, the\r\nmarches, the strange, quick changes of that eventful campaign, and\r\ngives glimpses of many things untold in any official reports or books or\r\njournals. These, indeed, are the things that are genuine and precious.\r\nThe man was there, has been out two years, has been through a dozen\r\nfights, the superfluous flesh of talking is long work'd off him, and he\r\ngives me little but the hard meat and sinew. I find it refreshing, these\r\nhardy, bright, intuitive, American young men, (experienc'd soldiers with\r\nall their youth.) The vocal play and significance moves one more than\r\nbooks. Then there hangs something majestic about a man who has borne his\r\npart in battles, especially if he is very quiet regarding it when you\r\ndesire him to unbosom. I am continually lost at the absence of blowing\r\nand blowers among these old-young American militaires. I have found some\r\nman or other who has been in every battle since the war began, and have\r\ntalk'd with them about each one in every part of the United States, and\r\nmany of the engagements on the rivers and harbors too. I find men\r\nhere from every State in the Union, without exception. (There are more\r\nSoutherners, especially border State men, in the Union army than is\r\ngenerally supposed. [A]) I now doubt whether one can get a fair idea\r\nof what this war practically is, or what genuine America is, and her\r\ncharacter, without some such experience as this I am having.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF A WISCONSIN OFFICER\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic scene of that dark and bloody 1863, from notes of\r\nmy visit to Armory-square hospital, one hot but pleasant summer day. In\r\nward H we approach the cot of a young lieutenant of one of the Wisconsin\r\nregiments. Tread the bare board floor lightly here, for the pain and\r\npanting of death are in this cot. I saw the lieutenant when he was first\r\nbrought here from Chancellorsville, and have been with him occasionally\r\nfrom day to day and night to night. He had been getting along pretty\r\nwell till night before last, when a sudden hemorrhage that could not be\r\nstopt came upon him, and to-day it still continues at intervals. Notice\r\nthat water-pail by the side of the bed, with a quantity of blood and\r\nbloody pieces of muslin, nearly full; that tells the story. The poor\r\nyoung man is struggling painfully for breath, his great dark eyes with\r\na glaze already upon them, and the choking faint but audible in his\r\nthroat. An attendant sits by him, and will not leave him till the last;\r\nyet little or nothing can be done. He will die here in an hour or two,\r\nwithout the presence of kith or kin. Meantime the ordinary chat and\r\nbusiness of[6] the ward a little way off goes on indifferently. Some\r\nof the inmates are laughing and joking, others are playing checkers or\r\ncards, others are reading, &c.\r\n\r\nI have noticed through most of the hospitals that as long as there\r\nis any chance for a man, no matter how bad he may be, the surgeon and\r\nnurses work hard, sometimes with curious tenacity, for his life, doing\r\neverything, and keeping somebody by him to execute the doctor's orders,\r\nand minister to him every minute night and day. See that screen there.\r\nAs you advance through the dusk of early candle-light, a nurse will step\r\nforth on tip-toe, and silently but imperiously forbid you to make any\r\nnoise, or perhaps to come near at all. Some soldier's life is flickering\r\nthere, suspended between recovery and death. Perhaps at this moment the\r\nexhausted frame has just fallen into a light sleep that a step might\r\nshake. You must retire. The neighboring patients must move in their\r\nstocking feet. I have been several times struck with such mark'd\r\nefforts--everything bent to save a life from the very grip of the\r\ndestroyer. But when that grip is once firmly fix'd, leaving no hope or\r\nchance at all, the surgeon abandons the patient. If it is a case\r\nwhere stimulus is any relief, the nurse gives milk-punch or brandy, or\r\nwhatever is wanted, _ad libitum_. There is no fuss made. Not a bit\r\nof sentimentalism or whining have I seen about a single death-bed in\r\nhospital or on the field, but generally impassive indifference. All is\r\nover, as far as any efforts can avail; it is useless to expend emotions\r\nor labors. While there is a prospect they strive hard--at least most\r\nsurgeons do; but death certain and evident, they yield the field.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n[6]MR. GARFIELD (_In the House of Representatives, April 15,'79_.) \"Do\r\ngentlemen know that (leaving out all the border States) there were fifty\r\nregiments and seven companies of white men in our army fighting for the\r\nUnion from the States that went into rebellion? Do they know that from\r\nthe single State of Kentucky more Union soldiers fought under our flag\r\nthan Napoleon took into the battle of Waterloo? more than Wellington\r\ntook with all the allied armies against Napoleon? Do they remember that\r\n186,000 color'd men fought under our flag against the rebellion and for\r\nthe Union, and that of that number 90,000 were from the States which\r\nwent into rebellion?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHOSPITALS ENSEMBLE\r\n\r\n_Aug., Sept., and Oct., '63._--I am in the habit of going to all, and\r\nto Fairfax seminary, Alexandria, and over Long bridge to the great\r\nConvalescent camp. The journals publish a regular directory of them--a\r\nlong list. As a specimen of almost any one of the larger of these\r\nhospitals, fancy to yourself a space of three to twenty acres of ground,\r\non which are group'd ten or twelve very large wooden barracks, with,\r\nperhaps, a dozen or twenty, and sometimes more than that number, small\r\nbuildings, capable altogether of accommodating from five hundred to a\r\nthousand or fifteen hundred persons. Sometimes these wooden barracks or\r\nwards, each of them perhaps from a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet\r\nlong, are rang'd in a straight row, evenly fronting the street; others\r\nare plann'd so as to form an immense V; and others again are ranged\r\naround a hollow square. They make altogether a huge cluster, with the\r\nadditional tents, extra wards for contagious diseases, guard-houses,\r\nsutler's stores, chaplain's house; in the middle will probably be an\r\nedifice devoted to the offices of the surgeon in charge and the ward\r\nsurgeons, principal attaches, clerks, &c. The wards are either letter'd\r\nalphabetically, ward G, ward K, or else numerically, 1, 2, 3, &c. Each\r\nhas its ward surgeon and corps of nurses. Of course, there is, in the\r\naggregate, quite a muster of employes, and over all the surgeon in\r\ncharge. Here in Washington, when these army hospitals are all fill'd,\r\n(as they have been already several times,) they contain a population\r\nmore numerous in itself than the whole of the Washington of ten or\r\nfifteen years ago. Within sight of the capitol, as I write, are some\r\nthirty or forty such collections, at times holding from fifty to seventy\r\nthousand men. Looking from any eminence and studying the topography in\r\nmy rambles, I use them as landmarks. Through the rich August verdure\r\nof the trees, see that white group of buildings off yonder in the\r\noutskirts; then another cluster half a mile to the left of the first;\r\nthen another a mile to the right, and another a mile beyond, and still\r\nanother between us and the first. Indeed, we can hardly look in any\r\ndirection but these clusters are dotting the landscape and environs.\r\nThat little town, as you might suppose it, off there on the brow of a\r\nhill, is indeed a town, but of wounds, sickness, and death. It is Finley\r\nhospital, northeast of the city, on Kendall green, as it used to be\r\ncall'd. That other is Campbell hospital. Both are large establishments.\r\nI have known these two alone to have from two thousand to twenty-five\r\nhundred inmates. Then there is Carver hospital, larger still, a wall'd\r\nand military city regularly laid out, and guarded by squads of sentries.\r\nAgain, off east, Lincoln hospital, a still larger one; and half a mile\r\nfurther Emory hospital. Still sweeping the eye around down the river\r\ntoward Alexandria, we see, to the right, the locality where the\r\nConvalescent camp stands, with its five, eight, or sometimes ten\r\nthousand inmates. Even all these are but a portion. The Harewood, Mount\r\nPleasant, Armory-square, Judiciary hospitals, are some of the rest, and\r\nall large collections.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SILENT NIGHT RAMBLE\r\n\r\n_October 20th_.--To-night, after leaving the hospital at 10 o'clock, (I\r\nhad been on self-imposed duty some five hours, pretty closely confined,)\r\nI wander'd a long time around Washington. The night was sweet, very\r\nclear, sufficiently cool, a voluptuous halfmoon, slightly golden, the\r\nspace near it of a transparent blue-gray tinge. I walk'd up Pennsylvania\r\navenue, and then to Seventh street, and a long while around the\r\nPatent-office. Somehow it look'd rebukefully strong, majestic, there in\r\nthe delicate moonlight. The sky, the planets, the constellations all\r\nso bright, so calm, so expressively silent, so soothing, after those\r\nhospital scenes. I wander'd to and fro till the moist moon set, long\r\nafter midnight.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPIRITUAL CHARACTERS AMONG THE SOLDIERS\r\n\r\nEvery now and then, in hospital or camp, there are beings I\r\nmeet--specimens of unworldliness, disinterestedness, and animal purity\r\nand heroism--perhaps some unconscious Indianian, or from Ohio or\r\nTennessee--on whose birth the calmness of heaven seems to have\r\ndescended, and whose gradual growing up, whatever the circumstances of\r\nwork-life or change, or hardship, or small or no education that attended\r\nit, the power of a strange spiritual sweetness, fibre and inward health,\r\nhave also attended. Something veil'd and abstracted is often a part of\r\nthe manners of these beings. I have met them, I say, not seldom in the\r\narmy, in camp, and in the hospitals. The Western regiments contain many\r\nof them. They are often young men, obeying the events and occasions\r\nabout them, marching, soldiering, righting, foraging, cooking, working\r\non farms or at some trade before the war--unaware of their own nature,\r\n(as to that, who is aware of his own nature?) their companions only\r\nunderstanding that they are different from the rest, more silent,\r\n\"something odd about them,\" and apt to go off and meditate and muse in\r\nsolitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATTLE DROVES ABOUT WASHINGTON\r\n\r\nAmong other sights are immense droves of cattle with their drivers,\r\npassing through the streets of the city. Some of the men have a way\r\nof leading the cattle by a peculiar call, a wild, pensive hoot, quite\r\nmusical, prolong'd, indescribable, sounding something between the cooing\r\nof a pigeon and the hoot of an owl. I like to stand and look at the\r\nsight of one of these immense droves--a little way off--(as the dust\r\nis great.) There are always men on horseback, cracking their whips\r\nand shouting--the cattle low--some obstinate ox or steer attempts to\r\nescape--then a lively scene--the mounted men, always excellent riders\r\nand on good horses, dash after the recusant, and wheel and turn--a\r\ndozen mounted drovers, their great slouch'd, broad-brim'd hats, very\r\npicturesque--another dozen on foot--everybody cover'd with dust--long\r\ngoads in their hands--an immense drove of perhaps 1000 cattle--the\r\nshouting, hooting, movement, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOSPITAL PERPLEXITY\r\n\r\nTo add to other troubles, amid the confusion of this great army of sick,\r\nit is almost impossible for a stranger to find any friend or relative,\r\nunless he has the patient's specific address to start upon. Besides the\r\ndirectory printed in the newspapers here, there are one or two general\r\ndirectories of the hospitals kept at provost's head-quarters, but they\r\nare nothing like complete; they are never up to date, and, as things\r\nare, with the daily streams of coming and going and changing, cannot\r\nbe. I have known cases, for instance such as a farmer coming here from\r\nnorthern New York to find a wounded brother, faithfully hunting round\r\nfor a week, and then compell'd to leave and go home without getting any\r\ntrace of him. When he got home he found a letter from the brother giving\r\nthe right address.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOWN AT THE FRONT\r\n\r\nCULPEPPER, VA., _Feb. '64._--Here I am FRONT pretty well down toward the\r\nextreme front. Three or four days ago General S., who is now in chief\r\ncommand, (I believe Meade is absent, sick,) moved a strong force\r\nsouthward from camp as if intending business. They went to the Rapidan;\r\nthere has since been some manoeuvering and a little fighting, but\r\nnothing of consequence. The telegraphic accounts given Monday morning\r\nlast, make entirely too much of it, I should say. What General S.\r\nintended we here know not, but we trust in that competent commander. We\r\nwere somewhat excited, (but not so very much either,) on Sunday, during\r\nthe day and night, as orders were sent out to pack up and harness, and\r\nbe ready to evacuate, to fall back towards Washington. But I was very\r\nsleepy and went to bed. Some tremendous shouts arousing me during the\r\nnight, I went forth and found it was from the men above mention'd, who\r\nwere returning. I talk'd with some of the men; as usual I found them\r\nfull of gayety, endurance, and many fine little outshows, the signs of\r\nthe most excellent good manliness of the world. It was a curious\r\nsight to see those shadowy columns moving through the night. I stood\r\nunobserv'd in the darkness and watch'd them long. The mud was very\r\ndeep. The men had their usual burdens, overcoats, knapsacks, guns and\r\nblankets. Along and along they filed by me, with often a laugh, a song,\r\na cheerful word, but never once a murmur. It may have been odd, but I\r\nnever before so realized the majesty and reality of the American people\r\n_en masse_. It fell upon me like a great awe. The strong ranks moved\r\nneither fast nor slow. They had march'd seven or eight miles already\r\nthrough the slipping unctuous mud. The brave First corps stopt here.\r\nThe equally brave Third corps moved on to Brandy station. The famous\r\nBrooklyn 14th are here, guarding the town. You see their red legs\r\nactively moving everywhere. Then they have a theatre of their own here.\r\nThey give musical performances, nearly everything done capitally. Of\r\ncourse the audience is a jam. It is good sport to attend one of these\r\nentertainments of the 14th. I like to look around at the soldiers, and\r\nthe general collection in front of the curtain, more than the scene on\r\nthe stage.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAYING THE BOUNTIES\r\n\r\nOne of the things to note here now is the arrival of the paymaster with\r\nhis strong box, and the payment of bounties to veterans re-enlisting.\r\nMajor H. is here to-day, with a small mountain of greenbacks, rejoicing\r\nthe hearts of the 2d division of the First corps. In the midst of a\r\nrickety shanty, behind a little table, sit the major and clerk Eldridge,\r\nwith the rolls before them, and much moneys. A re-enlisted man gets in\r\ncash about $200 down, (and heavy instalments following, as the pay-days\r\narrive, one after another.) The show of the men crowding around is quite\r\nexhilarating; I like to stand and look. They feel elated, their pockets\r\nfull, and the ensuing furlough, the visit home. It is a scene of\r\nsparkling eyes and flush'd cheeks. The soldier has many gloomy and harsh\r\nexperiences, and this makes up for some of them. Major H. is order'd to\r\npay first all the re-enlisted men of the First corps their bounties and\r\nback pay, and then the rest. You hear the peculiar sound of the rustling\r\nof the new and crisp greenbacks by the hour, through the nimble fingers\r\nof the major and my friend clerk E.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUMORS, CHANGES, ETC.\r\n\r\nAbout the excitement of Sunday, and the orders to be ready to start,\r\nI have heard since that the said orders came from some cautious minor\r\ncommander, and that the high principalities knew not and thought not of\r\nany such move; which is likely. The rumor and fear here intimated a long\r\ncircuit by Lee, and flank attack on our right. But I cast my eyes at the\r\nmud, which was then at its deepest and palmiest condition, and retired\r\ncomposedly to rest. Still it is about time for Culpepper to have a\r\nchange. Authorities have chased each other here like clouds in a stormy\r\nsky. Before the first Bull Run this was the rendezvous and camp of\r\ninstruction of the secession troops. I am stopping at the house of a\r\nlady who has witness'd all the eventful changes of the war, along this\r\nroute of contending armies. She is a widow, with a family of young\r\nchildren, and lives here with her sister in a large handsome house. A\r\nnumber of army officers board with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA\r\n\r\nDilapidated, fenceless, and trodden with war as Virginia is, wherever\r\nI move across her surface, I find myself rous'd to surprise and\r\nadmiration. What capacity for products, improvements, human life,\r\nnourishment and expansion. Everywhere that I have been in the Old\r\nDominion, (the subtle mockery of that title now!) such thoughts have\r\nfill'd me. The soil is yet far above the average of any of the northern\r\nStates. And how full of breadth the scenery, everywhere distant\r\nmountains, everywhere convenient rivers. Even yet prodigal in forest\r\nwoods, and surely eligible for all the fruits, orchards, and flowers.\r\nThe skies and atmosphere most luscious, as I feel certain, from more\r\nthan a year's residence in the State, and movements hither and yon. I\r\nshould say very healthy, as a general thing. Then a rich and elastic\r\nquality, by night and by day. The sun rejoices in his strength, dazzling\r\nand burning, and yet, to me, never unpleasantly weakening. It is not the\r\npanting tropical heat, but invigorates. The north tempers it. The nights\r\nare often unsurpassable. Last evening (Feb. 8,) I saw the first of the\r\nnew moon, the outlined old moon clear along with it; the sky and air\r\nso clear, such transparent hues of color, it seem'd to me I had never\r\nreally seen the new moon before. It was the thinnest cut crescent\r\npossible. It hung delicate just above the sulky shadow of the Blue\r\nmountains. Ah, if it might prove an omen and good prophecy for this\r\nunhappy State.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMER OF 1864\r\n\r\nI am back again in Washington, on my regular daily and nightly rounds.\r\nOf course there are many specialties. Dotting a ward here and there are\r\nalways cases of poor fellows, long-suffering under obstinate wounds,\r\nor weak and dishearten'd from typhoid fever, or the like; mark'd cases,\r\nneeding special and sympathetic nourishment. These I sit down and either\r\ntalk to, or silently cheer them up. They always like it hugely, (and so\r\ndo I.) Each case has its peculiarities, and needs some new adaptation. I\r\nhave learnt to thus conform--learnt a good deal of hospital wisdom.\r\nSome of the poor young chaps, away from home for the first time in their\r\nlives, hunger and thirst for affection; this is sometimes the only thing\r\nthat will reach their condition. The men like to have a pencil, and\r\nsomething to write in. I have given them cheap pocket-diaries, and\r\nalmanacs for 1864, interleav'd with blank paper. For reading I generally\r\nhave some old pictorial magazines or story papers--they are always\r\nacceptable. Also the morning or evening papers of the day. The best\r\nbooks I do not give, but lend to read through the wards, and then take\r\nthem to others, and so on; they are very punctual about returning the\r\nbooks. In these wards, or on the field, as I thus continue to go round,\r\nI have come to adapt myself to each emergency, after its kind or call,\r\nhowever trivial, however solemn, every one justified and made real\r\nunder its circumstances--not only visits and cheering talk and little\r\ngifts--not only washing and dressing wounds, (I have some cases where\r\nthe patient is unwilling any one should do this but me)--but passages\r\nfrom the Bible, expounding them, prayer at the bedside, explanations of\r\ndoctrine, &c. (I think I see my friends smiling at this confession, but\r\nI was never more in earnest in my life.) In camp and everywhere, I was\r\nin the habit of reading or giving recitations to the men. They were very\r\nfond of it, and liked declamatory poetical pieces. We would gather in\r\na large group by ourselves, after supper, and spend the time in such\r\nreadings, or in talking, and occasionally by an amusing game called the\r\ngame of twenty questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW ARMY ORGANIZATION FIT FOR AMERICA\r\n\r\nIt is plain to me out of the events of the war, north and south, and out\r\nof all considerations, that the current military theory, practice, rules\r\nand organization, (adopted from Europe from the feudal institutes, with,\r\nof course, the \"modern improvements,\" largely from the French,) though\r\ntacitly follow'd, and believ'd in by the officers generally, are not at\r\nall consonant with the United States, nor our people, nor our days. What\r\nit will be I know not--but I know that as entire an abnegation of the\r\npresent military system, and the naval too, and a building up from\r\nradically different root-bases and centres appropriate to us, must\r\neventually result, as that our political system has resulted and become\r\nestablish'd, different from feudal Europe, and built up on itself from\r\noriginal, perennial, democratic premises. We have undoubtedly in the\r\nUnited States the greatest military power--an exhaustless, intelligent,\r\nbrave and reliable rank and file--in the world, any land, perhaps all\r\nlands. The problem is to organize this in the manner fully appropriate\r\nto it, to the principles of the republic, and to get the best service\r\nout of it. In the present struggle, as already seen and review'd,\r\nprobably three-fourths of the losses, men, lives, &c., have been sheer\r\nsuperfluity, extravagance, waste.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF A HERO\r\n\r\nI wonder if I could ever convey to another--to you, for instance, reader\r\ndear--the tender and terrible realities of such cases, (many, many\r\nhappen'd,) as the one I am now going to mention. Stewart C. Glover,\r\ncompany E, 5th Wisconsin--was wounded May 5, in one of those fierce\r\ntussles of the Wilderness-died May 21--aged about 20. He was a small\r\nand beardless young man--a splendid soldier--in fact almost an ideal\r\nAmerican, of his age. He had serv'd nearly three years, and would have\r\nbeen entitled to his discharge in a few days. He was in Hancock's corps.\r\nThe fighting had about ceas'd for the day, and the general commanding\r\nthe brigade rode by and call'd for volunteers to bring in the wounded.\r\nGlover responded among the first--went out gayly--but while in the act\r\nof bearing in a wounded sergeant to our lines, was shot in the knee by\r\na rebel sharpshooter; consequence, amputation and death. He had resided\r\nwith his father, John Glover, an aged and feeble man, in Batavia,\r\nGenesee county, N. Y., but was at school in Wisconsin, after the war\r\nbroke out, and there enlisted--soon took to soldier-life, liked it,\r\nwas very manly, was belov'd by officers and comrades. He kept a little\r\ndiary, like so many of the soldiers. On the day of his death he wrote\r\nthe following in it, _to-day the doctor says I must die--all is over\r\nwith me--ah, so young to die_. On another blank leaf he pencill'd to his\r\nbrother, _dear brother Thomas, I have been brave but wicked--pray for\r\nme._\r\n\r\n\r\nHOSPITAL SCENES--INCIDENTS\r\n\r\nIt is Sunday afternoon, middle of summer, hot and oppressive, and very\r\nsilent through the ward. I am taking care of a critical case, now lying\r\nin a half lethargy. Near where I sit is a suffering rebel, from the\r\n8th Louisiana; his name is Irving. He has been here a long time, badly\r\nwounded, and lately had his leg amputated; it is not doing very well.\r\nRight opposite me is a sick soldier-boy, laid down with his clothes on,\r\nsleeping, looking much wasted, his pallid face on his arm. I see by the\r\nyellow trimming on his jacket that he is a cavalry boy. I step softly\r\nover and find by his card that he is named William Cone, of the 1st\r\nMaine cavalry, and his folks live in Skowhegan.\r\n\r\n_Ice Cream Treat_.--One hot day toward the middle of June, I gave the\r\ninmates of Carver hospital a general ice cream treat, purchasing a large\r\nquantity, and, under convoy of the doctor or head nurse, going\r\naround personally through the wards to see to its distribution. _An\r\nIncident_.--In one of the rights before Atlanta, a rebel soldier, of\r\nlarge size, evidently a young man, was mortally wounded top of the head,\r\nso that the brains partially exuded. He lived three days, lying on\r\nhis back on the spot where he first dropt. He dug with his heel in the\r\nground during that time a hole big enough to put in a couple of\r\nordinary knapsacks. He just lay there in the open air, and with little\r\nintermission kept his heel going night and day. Some of our soldiers\r\nthen moved him to a house, but he died in a few minutes.\r\n\r\n_Another_.--After the battles at Columbia, Tennessee, where we repuls'd\r\nabout a score of vehement rebel charges, they left a great many wounded\r\non the ground, mostly within our range. Whenever any of these wounded\r\nattempted to move away by any means, generally by crawling off, our men\r\nwithout exception brought them down by a bullet. They let none crawl\r\naway, no matter what his condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nA YANKEE SOLDIER\r\n\r\nAs I turn'd off the Avenue one cool October evening into Thirteenth\r\nstreet, a soldier with knapsack and overcoat stood at the corner\r\ninquiring his way. I found he wanted to go part of the road in my\r\ndirection, so we walk'd on together. We soon fell into conversation. He\r\nwas small and not very young, and a tough little fellow, as I judged in\r\nthe evening light, catching glimpses by the lamps we pass'd. His answers\r\nwere short, but clear. His name was Charles Carroll; he belong'd to\r\none of the Massachusetts regiments, and was born in or near Lynn. His\r\nparents were living, but were very old. There were four sons, and all\r\nhad enlisted. Two had died of starvation and misery in the prison at\r\nAndersonville, and one had been kill'd in the west. He only was left.\r\nHe was now going home, and by the way he talk'd I inferr'd that his time\r\nwas nearly out. He made great calculations on being with his parents to\r\ncomfort them the rest of their days.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNION PRISONERS SOUTH\r\n\r\nMichael Stansbury, 48 years of age, a seafaring man, a southerner by\r\nbirth and raising, formerly captain of U. S. light ship Long Shoal,\r\nstation'd at Long Shoal point, Pamlico sound--though a southerner, a\r\nfirm Union man--was captur'd Feb. 17, 1863, and has been nearly two\r\nyears in the Confederate prisons; was at one time order'd releas'd by\r\nGovernor Vance, but a rebel officer re-arrested him; then sent on to\r\nRichmond for exchange--but instead of being exchanged was sent down\r\n(as a southern citizen, not a soldier,) to Salisbury, N. C., where he\r\nremain'd until lately, when he escap'd among the exchang'd by assuming\r\nthe name of a dead soldier, and coming up via Wilmington with the rest.\r\nWas about sixteen months in Salisbury.\r\n\r\nSubsequent to October, '64, there were about 11,000 Union prisoners in\r\nthe stockade; about 100 of them southern unionists, 200 U. S. deserters.\r\nDuring the past winter 1500 of the prisoners, to save their lives,\r\njoin'd the confederacy, on condition of being assign'd merely to guard\r\nduty. Out of the 11,000 not more than 2500 came out; 500 of these were\r\npitiable, helpless wretches--the rest were in a condition to travel.\r\nThere were often 60 dead bodies to be buried in the morning; the daily\r\naverage would be about 40. The regular food was a meal of corn, the cob\r\nand husk ground together, and sometimes once a week a ration of sorghum\r\nmolasses. A diminutive ration of meat might possibly come once a month,\r\nnot oftener. In the stockade, containing the 11,000 men, there was a\r\npartial show of tents, not enough for 2000. A large proportion of the\r\nmen lived in holes in the ground, in the utmost wretchedness. Some froze\r\nto death, others had their hands and feet frozen. The rebel guards would\r\noccasionally, and on the least pretence, fire into the prison from mere\r\ndemonism and wantonness. All the horrors that can be named, starvation,\r\nlassitude, filth, vermin, despair, swift loss of self-respect, idiocy,\r\ninsanity, and frequent murder, were there. Stansbury has a wife and\r\nchild living in Newbern--has written to them from here--is in the U. S.\r\nlight-house employ still--(had been home to Newbern to see his family,\r\nand on his return to the ship was captured in his boat.) Has seen men\r\nbrought there to Salisbury as hearty as you ever see in your life--in\r\na few weeks completely dead gone, much of it from thinking on their\r\ncondition--hope all gone. Has himself a hard, sad, strangely deaden'd\r\nkind of look, as of one chill' d for years in the cold and dark, where\r\nhis good manly nature had no room to exercise itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESERTERS\r\n\r\n_Oct. 24_.--Saw a large squad of our own deserters (over 300) surrounded\r\nwith a cordon of arm'd guards, marching along Pennsylvania avenue. The\r\nmost motley collection I ever saw, all sorts of rig, all sorts of hats\r\nand caps, many fine-looking young fellows, some of them shame-faced,\r\nsome sickly, most of them dirty, shirts very dirty and long worn, &c.\r\nThey tramp'd along without order, a huge huddling mass, not in ranks. I\r\nsaw some of the spectators laughing, but I felt like anything else but\r\nlaughing. These deserters are far more numerous than would be thought.\r\nAlmost every day I see squads of them, sometimes two or three at a time,\r\nwith a small guard; sometimes ten or twelve, under a larger one. (I\r\nhear that desertions from the army now in the field have often averaged\r\n10,000 a month. One of the commonest sights in Washington is a squad of\r\ndeserters.)\r\n\r\n\r\nA GLIMPSE OF WAR'S HELL-SCENES\r\n\r\nIn one of the late movements of our troops in the valley, (near\r\nUpperville, I think,) a strong force of Moseby's mounted guerillas\r\nattack'd a train of wounded, and the guard of cavalry convoying them.\r\nThe ambulances contain'd about 60 wounded, quite a number of them\r\nofficers of rank. The rebels were in strength, and the capture of\r\nthe train and its partial guard after a short snap was effectually\r\naccomplish'd. No sooner had our men surrender'd, the rebels instantly\r\ncommenced robbing the train and murdering their prisoners, even the\r\nwounded. Here is the scene, or a sample of it, ten minutes after.\r\nAmong the wounded officers in the ambulances were one, a lieutenant of\r\nregulars, and another of higher rank. These two were dragg'd out on\r\nthe ground on their backs, and were now surrounded by the guerillas,\r\na demoniac crowd, each member of which was stabbing them in different\r\nparts of their bodies. One of the officers had his feet pinn'd firmly\r\nto the ground by bayonets stuck through them and thrust into the ground.\r\nThese two officers, as afterwards found on examination, had receiv'd\r\nabout twenty such thrusts, some of them through the mouth, face, &c. The\r\nwounded had all been dragg'd (to give a better chance also for plunder,)\r\nout of their wagons; some had been effectually dispatch'd, and their\r\nbodies were lying there lifeless and bloody. Others, not yet dead,\r\nbut horribly mutilated, were moaning or groaning. Of our men who\r\nsurrender'd, most had been thus maim'd or slaughter'd.\r\n\r\nAt this instant a force of our cavalry, who had been following the\r\ntrain at some interval, charged suddenly upon the secesh captors, who\r\nproceeded at once to make the best escape they could. Most of them got\r\naway, but we gobbled two officers and seventeen men, in the very acts\r\njust described. The sight was one which admitted of little discussion,\r\nas may be imagined. The seventeen captur'd men and two officers were put\r\nunder guard for the night, but it was decided there and then that they\r\nshould die. The next morning the two officers were taken in the\r\ntown, separate places, put in the centre of the street, and shot. The\r\nseventeen men were taken to an open ground, a little one side. They\r\nwere placed in a hollow square, half-encompass'd by two of our cavalry\r\nregiments, one of which regiments had three days before found the bloody\r\ncorpses of three of their men hamstrung and hung up by the heels to\r\nlimbs of trees by Moseby's guerillas, and the other had not long before\r\nhad twelve men, after surrendering, shot and then hung by the neck to\r\nlimbs of trees, and jeering inscriptions pinn'd to the breast of one of\r\nthe corpses, who had been a sergeant. Those three, and those twelve, had\r\nbeen found, I say, by these environing regiments. Now, with revolvers,\r\nthey form'd the grim cordon of the seventeen prisoners. The latter were\r\nplaced in the midst of the hollow square, unfasten'd, and the ironical\r\nremark made to them that they were now to be given \"a chance for\r\nthemselves.\" A few ran for it. But what use? From every side the deadly\r\npills came. In a few minutes the seventeen corpses strew'd the hollow\r\nsquare. I was curious to know whether some of the Union soldiers, some\r\nfew, (some one or two at least of the youngsters,) did not abstain from\r\nshooting on the helpless men. Not one. There was no exultation, very\r\nlittle said, almost nothing, yet every man there contributed his shot.\r\n\r\nMultiply the above by scores, aye hundreds--verify it in all the forms\r\nthat different circumstances, individuals, places, could afford--light\r\nit with every lurid passion, the wolf's, the lion's lapping thirst for\r\nblood--the passionate, boiling volcanoes of human revenge for comrades,\r\nbrothers slain--with the light of burning farms, and heaps of smutting,\r\nsmouldering black embers--and in the human heart everywhere black, worse\r\nembers--and you have an inkling of this war.\r\n\r\n\r\nGIFTS--MONEY--DISCRIMINATION\r\n\r\nAs a very large proportion of the wounded came up from the front without\r\na cent of money in their pockets, I soon discover'd that it was about\r\nthe best thing I could do to raise their spirits, and show them that\r\nsomebody cared for them, and practically felt a fatherly or brotherly\r\ninterest in them, to give them small sums in such cases, using tact and\r\ndiscretion about it. I am regularly supplied with funds for this purpose\r\nby good women and men in Boston, Salem, Providence, Brooklyn, and\r\nNew York. I provide myself with a quantity of bright new ten-cent and\r\nfive-cent bills, and, when I think it incumbent, I give 25 or 30\r\ncents, or perhaps 50 cents, and occasionally a still larger sum to some\r\nparticular case. As I have started this subject, I take opportunity to\r\nventilate the financial question. My supplies, altogether voluntary,\r\nmostly confidential, often seeming quite Providential, were numerous\r\nand varied. For instance, there were two distant and wealthy ladies,\r\nsisters, who sent regularly, for two years, quite heavy sums, enjoining\r\nthat their names should be kept secret. The same delicacy was indeed a\r\nfrequent condition. From several I had _carte blanche_. Many were entire\r\nstrangers. From these sources, during from two to three years, in the\r\nmanner described, in the hospitals, I bestowed, as almoner for others,\r\nmany, many thousands of dollars. I learn'd one thing conclusively--that\r\nbeneath all the ostensible greed and heartlessness of our times there\r\nis no end to the generous benevolence of men and women in the United\r\nStates, when once sure of their object. Another thing became clear to\r\nme--while _cash_ is not amiss to bring up the rear, tact and magnetic\r\nsympathy and unction are, and ever will be, sovereign still.\r\n\r\n\r\nITEMS FROM MY NOTE BOOKS\r\n\r\nSome of the half-eras'd, and not over-legible when made, memoranda of\r\nthings wanted by one patient or another, will convey quite a fair idea.\r\nD. S. G., bed 52, wants a good book; has a sore, weak throat; would like\r\nsome horehound candy; is from New Jersey, 28th regiment. C. H. L., 145th\r\nPennsylvania, lies in bed 6, with jaundice and erysipelas; also wounded;\r\nstomach easily nauseated; bring him some oranges, also a little tart\r\njelly; hearty, full-blooded young fellow--(he got better in a few days,\r\nand is now home on a furlough.) J. H. G., bed 24, wants an undershirt,\r\ndrawers, and socks; has not had a change for quite a while; is evidently\r\na neat, clean boy from New England--(I supplied him; also with a comb,\r\ntooth-brush, and some soap and towels; I noticed afterward he was the\r\ncleanest of the whole ward.) Mrs. G., lady-nurse, ward F, wants a bottle\r\nof brandy--has two patients imperatively requiring stimulus--low with\r\nwounds and exhaustion. (I supplied her with a bottle of first-rate\r\nbrandy from the Christian commission rooms.)\r\n\r\n\r\nA CASE FROM SECOND BULL RUN\r\n\r\nWell, Poor John Mahay is dead. He died yesterday. His was a painful and\r\nlong-lingering case (see p. 24 _ante_.) I have been with him at times\r\nfor the past fifteen months. He belonged to company A, 101st New York,\r\nand was shot through the lower region of the abdomen at second Bull Run,\r\nAugust, '62. One scene at his bedside will suffice for the agonies of\r\nnearly two years. The bladder had been perforated by a bullet going\r\nentirely through him. Not long since I sat a good part of the morning by\r\nhis bedside, ward E, Armory square. The water ran out of his eyes from\r\nthe intense pain, and the muscles of his face were distorted, but he\r\nutter'd nothing except a low groan now and then. Hot moist cloths were\r\napplied, and reliev'd him somewhat. Poor Mahay, a mere boy in age, but\r\nold in misfortune. He never knew the love of parents, was placed in\r\ninfancy in one of the New York charitable institutions, and subsequently\r\nbound out to a tyrannical master in Sullivan county, (the scars of whose\r\ncowhide and club remain'd yet on his back.) His wound here was a most\r\ndisagreeable one, for he was a gentle, cleanly, and affectionate boy.\r\nHe found friends in his hospital life, and, indeed, was a universal\r\nfavorite. He had quite a funeral ceremony.\r\n\r\n\r\nARMY SURGEONS--AID DEFICIENCIES\r\n\r\nI must bear my most emphatic testimony to the zeal, manliness, and\r\nprofessional spirit and capacity, generally prevailing among the\r\nsurgeons, many of them young men, in the hospitals and the army. I will\r\nnot say much about the exceptions, for they are few; (but I have met\r\nsome of those few, and very incompetent and airish they were.) I never\r\nceas'd to find the best men, and the hardest and most disinterested\r\nworkers, among the surgeons in the hospitals. They are full of genius,\r\ntoo. I have seen many hundreds of them and this is my testimony. There\r\nare, however, serious deficiencies, wastes, sad want of system, in the\r\ncommissions, contributions, and in all the voluntary, and a great part\r\nof the governmental nursing, edibles, medicines, stores, &c. (I do not\r\nsay surgical attendance, because the surgeons cannot do more than human\r\nendurance permits.) Whatever puffing accounts there may be in the papers\r\nof the North, this is the actual fact. No thorough previous preparation,\r\nno system, no foresight, no genius. Always plenty of stores, no doubt,\r\nbut never where they are needed, and never the proper application.\r\nOf all harrowing experiences, none is greater than that of the days\r\nfollowing a heavy battle. Scores, hundreds of the noblest men on earth,\r\nuncomplaining, lie helpless, mangled, faint, alone, and so bleed to\r\ndeath, or die from exhaustion, either actually untouch'd at all, or\r\nmerely the laying of them down and leaving them, when there ought to be\r\nmeans provided to save them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLUE EVERYWHERE\r\n\r\nThis city, its suburbs, the capitol, the front of the White House, the\r\nplaces of amusement, the Avenue, and all the main streets, swarm with\r\nsoldiers this winter, more than ever before. Some are out from the\r\nhospitals, some from the neighboring camps, &c. One source or another,\r\nthey pour plenteously, and make, I should say, the mark'd feature in the\r\nhuman movement and costume-appearance of our national city. Their blue\r\npants and overcoats are everywhere. The clump of crutches is heard up\r\nthe stairs of the paymasters' offices, and there are characteristic\r\ngroups around the doors of the same, often waiting long and wearily\r\nin the cold. Toward the latter part of the afternoon, you see the\r\nfurlough'd men, sometimes singly, sometimes in small squads, making\r\ntheir way to the Baltimore depot. At all times, except early in the\r\nmorning, the patrol detachments are moving around, especially during the\r\nearlier hours of evening, examining passes, and arresting all soldiers\r\nwithout them. They do not question the one-legged, or men badly disabled\r\nor main'd, but all others are stopt. They also go around evenings\r\nthrough the auditoriums of the theatres, and make officers and all show\r\ntheir passes, or other authority, for being there.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MODEL HOSPITAL\r\n\r\n_Sunday, January 29th, 1865_.--Have been in Armory-square this\r\nafternoon. The wards are very comfortable, new floors and plaster walls,\r\nand models of neatness. I am not sure but this is a model hospital after\r\nall, in important respects. I found several sad cases of old lingering\r\nwounds. One Delaware soldier, William H. Millis, from Bridgeville, whom\r\nI had been with after the battles of the Wilderness, last May, where he\r\nreceiv'd a very bad wound in the chest, with another in the left arm,\r\nand whose case was serious (pneumonia had set in) all last June and\r\nJuly, I now find well enough to do light duty. For three weeks at the\r\ntime mention'd he just hovered between life and death.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOYS IN THE ARMY\r\n\r\nAs I walk'd home about sunset, I saw in Fourteenth street a very young\r\nsoldier, thinly clad, standing near the house I was about to enter. I\r\nstopt a moment in front of the door and call'd him to me. I knew that an\r\nold Tennessee regiment, and also an Indiana regiment, were temporarily\r\nstopping in new barracks, near Fourteenth street. This boy I found\r\nbelonged to the Tennessee regiment. But I could hardly believe he\r\ncarried a musket. He was but 15 years old, yet had been twelve months a\r\nsoldier, and had borne his part in several battles, even historic\r\nones. I ask'd him if he did not suffer from the cold, and if he had\r\nno overcoat. No, he did not suffer from cold, and had no overcoat, but\r\ncould draw one whenever he wish'd. His father was dead, and his mother\r\nliving in some part of East Tennessee; all the men were from that\r\npart of the country. The next forenoon I saw the Tennessee and Indiana\r\nregiments marching down the Avenue. My boy was with the former, stepping\r\nalong with the rest. There were many other boys no older. I stood and\r\nwatch'd them as they tramp'd along with slow, strong, heavy, regular\r\nsteps. There did not appear to be a man over 30 years of age, and a\r\nlarge proportion were from 15 to perhaps 22 or 23. They had all the look\r\nof veterans, worn, stain'd, impassive, and a certain unbent, lounging\r\ngait, carrying in addition to their regular arms and knapsacks,\r\nfrequently a frying-pan, broom, &c. They were all of pleasant\r\nphysiognomy; no refinement, nor blanch'd with intellect, but as my eye\r\npick'd them, moving along, rank by rank, there did not seem to be a\r\nsingle repulsive, brutal or markedly stupid face among them.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURIAL OF A LADY NURSE\r\n\r\nHere is an incident just occurr'd in one of the hospitals. A lady named\r\nMiss or Mrs. Billings, who has long been a practical friend of soldiers,\r\nand nurse in the army, and had become attached to it in a way that no\r\none can realize but him or her who has had experience, was taken sick,\r\nearly this winter, linger'd some time, and finally died in the hospital.\r\nIt was her request that she should be buried among the soldiers, and\r\nafter the military method. This request was fully carried out. Her\r\ncoffin was carried to the grave by soldiers, with the usual escort,\r\nburied, and a salute fired over the grave. This was at Annapolis a few\r\ndays since.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEMALE NURSES FOR SOLDIERS\r\n\r\nThere are many women in one position or another, among the hospitals,\r\nmostly as nurses here in Washington, and among the military stations;\r\nquite a number of them young ladies acting as volunteers. They are a\r\nhelp in certain ways, and deserve to be mention'd with respect. Then\r\nit remains to be distinctly said that few or no young ladies, under the\r\nirresistible conventions of society, answer the practical requirements\r\nof nurses for soldiers. Middle-aged or healthy and good condition'd\r\nelderly women, mothers of children, are always best. Many of the wounded\r\nmust be handled. A hundred things which cannot be gainsay'd, must occur\r\nand must be done. The presence of a good middle-aged or elderly woman,\r\nthe magnetic touch of hands, the expressive features of the mother, the\r\nsilent soothing of her presence, her words, her knowledge and privileges\r\narrived at only through having had children, are precious and final\r\nqualifications. It is a natural faculty that is required; it is not\r\nmerely having a genteel young woman at a table in a ward. One of the\r\nfinest nurses I met was a red-faced illiterate old Irish woman; I have\r\nseen her take the poor wasted naked boys so tenderly up in her arms.\r\nThere are plenty of excellent clean old black women that would make\r\ntip-top nurses.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN ESCAPEES\r\n\r\n_Feb. 23, '65_.--I saw a large procession of young men from the rebel\r\narmy, (deserters they are call'd, but the usual meaning of the word does\r\nnot apply to them,) passing the Avenue to-day. There were nearly 200,\r\ncome up yesterday by boat from James river. I stood and watch'd them\r\nas they shuffled along, in a slow, tired, worn sort of way; a large\r\nproportion of light-hair'd, blonde, light gray-eyed young men among\r\nthem. Their costumes had a dirt-stain'd uniformity; most had been\r\noriginally gray; some had articles of our uniform, pants on one, vest\r\nor coat on another; I think they were mostly Georgia and North Carolina\r\nboys. They excited little or no attention. As I stood quite close to\r\nthem, several good looking enough youths, (but O what a tale of misery\r\ntheir appearance told,) nodded or just spoke to me, without doubt\r\ndivining pity and fatherliness out of my face, for my heart was full\r\nenough of it. Several of the couples trudg'd along with their arms about\r\neach other, some probably brothers, as if they were afraid they might\r\nsomehow get separated. They nearly all look'd what one might call\r\nsimple, yet intelligent, too. Some had pieces of old carpet, some\r\nblankets, and others old bags around their shoulders. Some of them here\r\nand there had fine faces, still it was a procession of misery. The two\r\nhundred had with them about half a dozen arm'd guards. Along this week\r\nI saw some such procession, more or less in numbers, every day, as they\r\nwere brought up by the boat. The government does what it can for them,\r\nand sends them north and west.\r\n\r\n_Feb. 27_.--Some three or four hundred more escapees from the\r\nconfederate army came up on the boat. As the day has been very pleasant\r\nindeed, (after a long spell of bad weather,) I have been wandering\r\naround a good deal, without any other object than to be out-doors and\r\nenjoy it; have met these escaped men in all directions. Their apparel is\r\nthe same ragged, long-worn motley as before described. I talk'd with a\r\nnumber of the men. Some are quite bright and stylish, for all their poor\r\nclothes--walking with an air, wearing their old head-coverings on one\r\nside, quite saucily. I find the old, unquestionable proofs, as all\r\nalong the past four years, of the unscrupulous tyranny exercised by the\r\nsecession government in conscripting the common people by absolute force\r\neverywhere, and paying no attention whatever to the men's time being\r\nup--keeping them in military service just the same. One gigantic young\r\nfellow, a Georgian, at least six feet three inches high, broad-sized in\r\nproportion, attired in the dirtiest, drab, well smear'd rags, tied\r\nwith strings, his trousers at the knees all strips and streamers, was\r\ncomplacently standing eating some bread and meat. He appear'd contented\r\nenough. Then a few minutes after I saw him slowly walking along. It was\r\nplain he did not take anything to heart.\r\n\r\n_Feb. 28._--As I pass'd the military headquarters of the city, not far\r\nfrom the President's house, I stopt to interview some of the crowd of\r\nescapees who were lounging there. In appearance they were the same as\r\npreviously mention'd. Two of them, one about 17, and the other perhaps\r\n25 or '6, I talk'd with some time. They were from North Carolina, born\r\nand rais'd there, and had folks there. The elder had been in the rebel\r\nservice four years. He was first conscripted for two years. He was then\r\nkept arbitrarily in the ranks. This is the case with a large proportion\r\nof the secession army. There was nothing downcast in these young\r\nmen's manners; the younger had been soldiering about a year; he was\r\nconscripted; there were six brothers (all the boys of the family) in\r\nthe army, part of them as conscripts, part as volunteers; three had been\r\nkill'd; one had escaped about four months ago, and now this one had got\r\naway; he was a pleasant and well-talking lad, with the peculiar North\r\nCarolina idiom (not at all disagreeable to my ears.) He and the elder\r\none were of the same company, and escaped together--and wish'd to remain\r\ntogether. They thought of getting transportation away to Missouri, and\r\nworking there; but were not sure it was judicious. I advised them rather\r\nto go to some of the directly northern States, and get farm work for the\r\npresent. The younger had made six dollars on the boat, with some tobacco\r\nhe brought; he had three and a half left. The elder had nothing; I\r\ngave him a trifle. Soon after, met John Wormley, 9th Alabama, a West\r\nTennessee rais' d boy, parents both dead--had the look of one for a long\r\ntime on short allowance--said very little--chew'd tobacco at a fearful\r\nrate, spitting in proportion--large clear dark-brown eyes, very\r\nfine--didn't know what to make of me--told me at last he wanted much\r\nto get some clean underclothes, and a pair of decent pants. Didn't care\r\nabout coat or hat fixings. Wanted a chance to wash himself well, and\r\nput on the underclothes. I had the very great pleasure of helping him to\r\naccomplish all those wholesome designs.\r\n\r\n_March 1st_.--Plenty more butternut or clay-color'd escapees every\r\nday. About 160 came in to-day, a large portion South Carolinians. They\r\ngenerally take the oath of allegiance, and are sent north, west, or\r\nextreme south-west if they wish. Several of them told me that the\r\ndesertions in their army, of men going home, leave or no leave, are far\r\nmore numerous than their desertions to our side. I saw a very forlorn\r\nlooking squad of about a hundred, late this afternoon, on their way to\r\nthe Baltimore depot.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAPITOL BY GAS-LIGHT\r\n\r\nTo-night I have been wandering awhile in the capitol, which is all lit\r\nup. The illuminated rotunda looks fine. I like to stand aside and look a\r\nlong, long while, up at the dome; it comforts me somehow. The House and\r\nSenate were both in session till very late. I look'd in upon them, but\r\nonly a few moments; they were hard at work on tax and appropriation\r\nbills. I wander'd through the long and rich corridors and apartments\r\nunder the Senate; an old habit of mine, former winters, and now more\r\nsatisfaction than ever. Not many persons down there, occasionally a\r\nflitting figure in the distance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INAUGURATION\r\n\r\n_March 4th._--The President very quietly rode down to the capitol in his\r\nown carriage, by himself, on a sharp trot, about noon, either because\r\nhe wish'd to be on hand to sign bills, or to get rid of marching in line\r\nwith the absurd procession, the muslin temple of liberty and pasteboard\r\nmonitor. I saw him on his return, at three o'clock, after the\r\nperformance was over. He was in his plain two-horse barouche, and look'd\r\nvery much worn and tired; the lines, indeed, of vast responsibilities,\r\nintricate questions, and demands of life and death, cut deeper than ever\r\nupon his dark brown face; yet all the old goodness, tenderness, sadness,\r\nand canny shrewdness, underneath the furrows. (I never see that man\r\nwithout feeling that he is one to become personally attach'd to, for his\r\ncombination of purest, heartiest tenderness, and native western form of\r\nmanliness.) By his side sat his little boy, of ten years. There were no\r\nsoldiers, only a lot of civilians on horseback, with huge yellow scarfs\r\nover their shoulders, riding around the carriage. (At the inauguration\r\nfour years ago, he rode down and back again surrounded by a dense\r\nmass of arm'd cavalrymen eight deep, with drawn sabres; and there were\r\nsharpshooters station'd at every corner on the route.) I ought to make\r\nmention of the closing levee of Saturday night last. Never before was\r\nsuch a compact jam in front of the White House--all the grounds fill'd,\r\nand away out to the spacious sidewalks. I was there, as I took a\r\nnotion to go--was in the rush inside with the crowd--surged along the\r\npassage-ways, the blue and other rooms, and through the great east room.\r\nCrowds of country people, some very funny. Fine music from the Marine\r\nband, off in a side place. I saw Mr. Lincoln, drest all in black, with\r\nwhite kid gloves and a claw-hammer coat, receiving, as in duty bound,\r\nshaking hands, looking very disconsolate, and as if he would give\r\nanything to be somewhere else.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTITUDE OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS DURING THE WAR\r\n\r\nLooking over my scraps, I find I wrote the following during 1864. The\r\nhappening to our America, abroad as well as at home, these years, is\r\nindeed most strange. The democratic republic has paid her today the\r\nterrible and resplendent compliment of the united wish of all the\r\nnations of the world that her union should be broken, her future\r\ncut off, and that she should be compell'd to descend to the level\r\nof kingdoms and empires ordinarily great. There is certainly not one\r\ngovernment in Europe but is now watching the war in this country, with\r\nthe ardent prayer that the United States may be effectually split,\r\ncrippled, and dismember'd by it. There is not one but would help toward\r\nthat dismemberment, if it dared. I say such is the ardent wish to-day of\r\nEngland and of France, as governments, and of all the nations of Europe,\r\nas governments. I think indeed it is to-day the real, heartfelt wish\r\nof all the nations of the world, with the single exception of\r\nMexico--Mexico, the only one to whom we have ever really done wrong,\r\nand now the only one who prays for us and for our triumph, with genuine\r\nprayer. Is it not indeed strange? America, made up of all, cheerfully\r\nfrom the beginning opening her arms to all, the result and justifier of\r\nall, of Britain, Germany, France and Spain--all here--the accepter, the\r\nfriend, hope, last resource and general house of all--she who has\r\nharm'd none, but been bounteous to so many, to millions, the mother of\r\nstrangers and exiles, all nations--should now, I say, be paid this dread\r\ncompliment of general governmental fear and hatred. Are we indignant?\r\nalarm'd? Do we feel jeopardized? No; help'd, braced, concentrated,\r\nrather. We are all too prone to wander from ourselves, to affect Europe,\r\nand watch her frowns and smiles. We need this hot lesson of general\r\nhatred, and henceforth must never forget it. Never again will we trust\r\nthe moral sense nor abstract friendliness of a single _government_ of\r\nthe old world.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WEATHER--DOES IT SYMPATHIZE WITH THESE TIMES?\r\n\r\nWhether the rains, the heat and cold, and what underlies them all,\r\nare affected with what affects man in masses, and follow his play of\r\npassionate action, strain'd stronger than usual, and on a larger scale\r\nthan usual--whether this, or no, it is certain that there is now, and\r\nhas been for twenty months or more, on this American continent north,\r\nmany a remarkable, many an unprecedented expression of the subtile world\r\nof air above us and around us. There, since this war, and the wide and\r\ndeep national agitation, strange analogies, different combinations, a\r\ndifferent sunlight, or absence of it; different products even out of the\r\nground. After every great battle, a great storm. Even civic events the\r\nsame. On Saturday last, a forenoon like whirling demons, dark, with\r\nslanting rain, full of rage; and then the afternoon, so calm, so bathed\r\nwith flooding splendor from heaven's most excellent sun, with atmosphere\r\nof sweetness; so clear, it show'd the stars, long long before they were\r\ndue. As the President came out on the capitol portico, a curious little\r\nwhite cloud, the only one in that part of the sky, appear'd like a\r\nhovering bird, right over him.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the heavens, the elements, all the meteorological influences,\r\nhave run riot for weeks past. Such caprices, abruptest alternation of\r\nfrowns and beauty, I never knew. It is a common remark that (as last\r\nsummer was different in its spells of intense heat from any preceding\r\nit,) the winter just completed has been without parallel. It has\r\nremain'd so down to the hour I am writing. Much of the daytime of the\r\npast month was sulky, with leaden heaviness, fog, interstices of bitter\r\ncold, and some insane storms. But there have been samples of another\r\ndescription. Nor earth nor sky ever knew spectacles of superber beauty\r\nthan some of the nights lately here. The western star, Venus, in the\r\nearlier hours of evening, has never been so large, so clear; it seems\r\nas if it told something, as if it held rapport indulgent with humanity,\r\nwith us Americans. Five or six nights since, it hung close by the moon,\r\nthen a little past its first quarter. The star was wonderful, the moon\r\nlike a young mother. The sky, dark blue, the transparent night, the\r\nplanets, the moderate west wind, the elastic temperature, the miracle of\r\nthat great star, and the young and swelling moon swimming in the west,\r\nsuffused the soul. Then I heard, slow and clear, the deliberate notes of\r\na bugle come up out of the silence, sounding so good through the night's\r\nmystery, no hurry, but firm and faithful, floating along, rising,\r\nfalling leisurely, with here and there a long-drawn note; the bugle,\r\nwell play'd, sounding tattoo, in one of the army hospitals near here,\r\nwhere the wounded (some of them personally so dear to me,) are lying\r\nin their cots, and many a sick boy come down to the war from Illinois,\r\nMichigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, and the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nINAUGURATION BALL\r\n\r\n_March 6_.--I have been up to look at the dance and supper-rooms,\r\nfor the inauguration ball at the Patent office; and I could not help\r\nthinking, what a different scene they presented to my view a while\r\nsince, fill'd with a crowded mass of the worst wounded of the war,\r\nbrought in from second Bull Run, Antietam, and Fredericksburgh.\r\nTo-night, beautiful women, perfumes, the violin's sweetness, the polka\r\nand the waltz; then the amputation, the blue face, the groan, the glassy\r\neye of the dying, the clotted rag, the odor of wounds and blood, and\r\nmany a mother's son amid strangers, passing away untended there, (for\r\nthe crowd of the badly hurt was great, and much for nurse to do, and\r\nmuch for surgeon.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE AT THE CAPITOL\r\n\r\nI must mention a strange scene at the capitol, the hall of\r\nRepresentatives, the morning of Saturday last, (March 4th.) The day just\r\ndawn'd, but in half-darkness, everything dim, leaden, and soaking. In\r\nthat dim light, the members nervous from long drawn duty, exhausted,\r\nsome asleep, and many half asleep. The gas-light, mix'd with the\r\ndingy day-break, produced an unearthly effect. The poor little sleepy,\r\nstumbling pages, the smell of the hall, the members with heads leaning\r\non their desks, the sounds of the voices speaking, with unusual\r\nintonations--the general moral atmosphere also of the close of this\r\nimportant session--the strong hope that the war is approaching its\r\nclose--the tantalizing dread lest the hope may be a false one--the\r\ngrandeur of the hall itself, with its effect of vast shadows up toward\r\nthe panels and spaces over the galleries--all made a mark'd combination.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this, with the suddenness of a thunderbolt, burst one of\r\nthe most angry and crashing storms of rain and hail ever heard. It\r\nbeat like a deluge on the heavy glass roof of the hall, and the wind\r\nliterally howl'd and roar'd. For a moment, (and no wonder,) the nervous\r\nand sleeping Representatives were thrown into confusion. The slumberers\r\nawaked with fear, some started for the doors, some look'd up with\r\nblanch'd cheeks and lips to the roof, and the little pages began to cry;\r\nit was a scene. But it was over almost as soon as the drowsied men were\r\nactually awake. They recover'd themselves; the storm raged on, beating,\r\ndashing, and with loud noises at times. But the House went ahead with\r\nits business then, I think, as calmly and with as much deliberation as\r\nat any time in its career. Perhaps the shock did it good. (One is not\r\nwithout impression, after all, amid these members of Congress, of both\r\nthe Houses, that if the flat routine of their duties should ever be\r\nbroken in upon by some great emergency involving real danger, and\r\ncalling for first-class personal qualities, those qualities would be\r\nfound generally forthcoming, and from men not now credited with them.)\r\n\r\n\r\nA YANKEE ANTIQUE\r\n\r\n_March 27, 1865_.--Sergeant Calvin F. Harlowe, company C, 29th\r\nMassachusetts, 3d brigade, 1st division, Ninth corps--a mark'd sample\r\nof heroism and death, (some may say bravado, but I say heroism, of\r\ngrandest, oldest order)--in the late attack by the rebel troops, and\r\ntemporary capture by them, of fort Steadman, at night. The fort was\r\nsurprised at dead of night. Suddenly awaken'd from their sleep, and\r\nrushing from their tents, Harlowe, with others, found himself in the\r\nhands of the secesh--they demanded his surrender--he answer'd, _Never\r\nwhile I live_. (Of course it was useless. The others surrender'd; the\r\nodds were too great.) Again he was ask'd to yield, this time by a rebel\r\ncaptain. Though surrounded, and quite calm, he again refused, call'd\r\nsternly to his comrades to fight on, and himself attempted to do so.\r\nThe rebel captain then shot him--but at the same instant he shot the\r\ncaptain. Both fell together mortally wounded. Harlowe died almost\r\ninstantly. The rebels were driven out in a very short time. The body\r\nwas buried next day, but soon taken up and sent home, (Plymouth county,\r\nMass.) Harlowe was only 22 years of age--was a tall, slim, dark-hair'd,\r\nblue-eyed young man--had come out originally with the 29th; and that\r\nis the way he met his death, after four years' campaign. He was in the\r\nSeven Days fight before Richmond, in second Bull Run, Antietam, first\r\nFredericksburgh, Vicksburgh, Jackson, Wilderness, and the campaigns\r\nfollowing--was as good a soldier as ever wore the blue, and every old\r\nofficer in the regiment will bear that testimony. Though so young, and\r\nin a common rank, he had a spirit as resolute and brave as any hero\r\nin the books, ancient or modern--It was too great to say the words \"I\r\nsurrender\"--and so he died. (When I think of such things, knowing them\r\nwell, all the vast and complicated events of the war, on which history\r\ndwells and makes its volumes, fall aside, and for the moment at any rate\r\nI see nothing but young Calvin Harlowe's figure in the night, disdaining\r\nto surrender.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDS AND DISEASES\r\n\r\nThe war is over, but the hospitals are fuller than ever, from former and\r\ncurrent cases. A large' majority of the wounds are in the arms and legs.\r\nBut there is every kind of wound, in every part of the body. I should\r\nsay of the sick, from my observation, that the prevailing maladies\r\nare typhoid fever and the camp fevers generally, diarrhoea, catarrhal\r\naffections and bronchitis, rheumatism and pneumonia. These forms of\r\nsickness lead; all the rest follow. There are twice as many sick as\r\nthere are wounded. The deaths range from seven to ten per cent, of those\r\nunder treatment.[7]\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n[7] In the U. S. Surgeon-General's office since, there is a formal\r\nrecord and treatment of 153, 142 cases of wounds by government surgeons.\r\nWhat must have been the number unofficial, indirect--to say nothing of\r\nthe Southern armies?\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN\r\n\r\n_April 16, '65_.--I find in my notes of the time, this passage on the\r\ndeath of Abraham Lincoln: He leaves for America's history and biography,\r\nso far, not only its most dramatic reminiscence--he leaves, in my\r\nopinion, the greatest, best, most characteristic, artistic, moral\r\npersonality. Not but that he had faults, and show'd them in the\r\nPresidency; but honesty, goodness, shrewdness, conscience, and (a new\r\nvirtue, unknown to other lands, and hardly yet really known here, but\r\nthe foundation and tie of all, as the future will grandly develop,)\r\nUNIONISM, in its truest and amplest sense, form'd the hard-pan of his\r\ncharacter. These he seal'd with his life. The tragic splendor of his\r\ndeath, purging, illuminating all, throws round his form, his head, an\r\naureole that will remain and will grow brighter through time, while\r\nhistory lives, and love of country lasts. By many has this Union been\r\nhelp'd; but if one name, one man, must be pick'd out, he, most of all,\r\nis the conservator of it, to the future. He was assassinated--but the\r\nUnion is not assassinated--_ça ira_! One falls and another falls. The\r\nsoldier drops, sinks like a wave--but the ranks of the ocean\r\neternally press on. Death does its work, obliterates a hundred, a\r\nthousand--President, general, captain, private,--but the Nation is\r\nimmortal.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHERMAN'S ARMY'S JUBILATION--ITS SUDDEN STOPPAGE\r\n\r\nWhen Sherman's armies, (long after they left Atlanta,) were marching\r\nthrough Southand North Carolina--after leaving Savannah, the news of\r\nLee's capitulation having been receiv'd--the men never mov'd a mile\r\nwithout from some part of the line sending up continued, inspiriting\r\nshouts. At intervals all day long sounded out the wild music of those\r\npeculiar army cries. They would be commenc'd by one regiment or brigade,\r\nimmediately taken up by others, and at length whole corps and armies\r\nwould join in these wild triumphant choruses. It was one of the\r\ncharacteristic expressions of the western troops, and became a habit,\r\nserving as a relief and outlet to the men--a vent for their feelings of\r\nvictory, returning peace, &c. Morning, noon, and afternoon, spontaneous,\r\nfor occasion or without occasion, these huge, strange cries, differing\r\nfrom any other, echoing through the open air for many a mile, expressing\r\nyouth, joy, wildness, irrepressible strength, and the ideas of advance\r\nand conquest, sounded along the swamps and uplands of the South,\r\nfloating to the skies. (\"There never were men that kept in better\r\nspirits in danger or defeat--what then could they do in victory?\"--said\r\none of the 15th corps to me, afterwards.) This exuberance continued till\r\nthe armies arrived at Raleigh. There the news of the President's murder\r\nwas receiv'd. Then no more shouts or yells, for a week. All the marching\r\nwas comparatively muffled. It was very significant--hardly a loud word\r\nor laugh in many of the regiments. A hush and silence pervaded all.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO GOOD PORTRAIT OF LINCOLN\r\n\r\nProbably the reader has seen physiognomies (often old farmers,\r\nsea-captains, and such) that, behind their homeliness, or even ugliness,\r\nheld superior points so subtle, yet so palpable, making the real life\r\nof their faces almost as impossible to depict as a wild perfume or\r\nfruit-taste, or a passionate tone of the living voice--and such was\r\nLincoln's face, the peculiar color, the lines of it, the eyes, mouth,\r\nexpression. Of technical beauty it had nothing--but to the eye of a\r\ngreat artist it furnished a rare study, a feast and fascination. The\r\ncurrent portraits are all failures--most of them caricatures.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELEAS'D UNION PRISONERS FROM SOUTH\r\n\r\nThe releas'd prisoners of war are now coming up from the southern\r\nprisons. I have seen a number of them. The sight is worse than any sight\r\nof battle-fields, or any collection of wounded, even the bloodiest.\r\nThere was, (as a sample,) one large boat load, of several hundreds,\r\nbrought about the 25th, to Annapolis; and out of the whole number only\r\nthree individuals were able to walk from the boat. The rest were carried\r\nashore and laid down in one place or another. Can those be _men_--those\r\nlittle livid brown, ash-streak'd, monkey-looking dwarfs?--are they\r\nreally not mummied, dwindled corpses? They lay there, most of them,\r\nquite still, but with a horrible look in their eyes and skinny lips\r\n(often with not enough flesh on the lips to cover their teeth.) Probably\r\nno more appalling sight was ever seen on this earth. (There are deeds,\r\ncrimes, that may be forgiven; but this is not among them. It steeps its\r\nperpetrators in blackest, escapeless, endless damnation. Over 50,000\r\nhave been compell' d to die the death of starvation--reader, did\r\nyou ever try to realize what _starvation_ actually is?--in those\r\nprisons--and in a land of plenty.) An indescribable meanness, tyranny,\r\naggravating course of insults, almost incredible--was evidently the rule\r\nof treatment through all the southern military prisons. The dead there\r\nare not to be pitied as much as some of the living that come from\r\nthere--if they can be call' d living--many of them are mentally\r\nimbecile, and will never recuperate.[8]\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n[8] _From a review of_ \"ANDERSONVILLE, A STORY OF SOUTHERN MILTTARY\r\nPRISONS,\" _published serially in the Toledo \"Blade\" in 1879, and\r\nafterwards in book form_.\r\n\r\n\"There is a deep fascination in the subject of Andersonville--for that\r\nGolgotha, in which lie the whitening bones of 13,000 gallant young\r\nmen, represents the dearest and costliest sacrifice of the war for the\r\npreservation of our national unity. It is a type, too, of its class. Its\r\nmore than hundred hecatombs of dead represent several times that number\r\nof their brethren, for whom the prison gates of Belle Isle, Danville,\r\nSalisbury, Florence, Columbia, and Cahaba open'd only in eternity. There\r\nare few families in the North who have not at least one dear relative or\r\nfriend among these 60,000 whose sad fortune it was to end their service\r\nfor the Union by lying down and dying for it in a southern prison pen.\r\nThe manner of their death, the horrors that cluster'd thickly around\r\nevery moment of their existence, the loyal, unfaltering steadfastness\r\nwith which they endured all that fate had brought them, has never been\r\nadequately told. It was not with them as with their comrades in the\r\nfield, whose every act was perform'd in the presence of those whose duty\r\nit was to observe such matters and report them to the world. Hidden from\r\nthe view of their friends in the north by the impenetrable veil\r\nwhich the military operations of the rebels drew around the so-called\r\nconfederacy, the people knew next to nothing of their career or their\r\nsufferings. Thousands died there less heeded even than the hundreds\r\nwho perish'd on the battlefield. Grant did not lose as many men kill'd\r\noutright, in the terrible campaign from the Wilderness to the James\r\nriver--43 days of desperate fighting--as died in July and August at\r\nAndersonville. Nearly twice as many died in that prison as fell from the\r\nday that Grant cross'd the Rapidan, till he settled down in the trenches\r\nbefore Petersburg. More than four times as many Union dead lie under\r\nthe solemn soughing pines about that forlorn little village in southern\r\nGeorgia, than mark the course of Sherman from Chattanooga to Atlanta.\r\nThe nation stands aghast at the expenditure of life which attended the\r\ntwo bloody campaigns of 1864, which virtually crush'd the confederacy,\r\nbut no one remembers that more Union soldiers died in the rear of the\r\nrebel lines than were kill'd in the front of them. The great military\r\nevents which stamp'd out the rebellion drew attention away from the sad\r\ndrama which starvation and disease play'd in those gloomy pens in the\r\nfar recesses of sombre southern forests.\"\r\n\r\n_From a letter of \"Johnny Bouquet,\" in N. Y. \"Tribune,\" March 27, '81._\r\n\r\n\"I visited at Salisbury, N. C., the prison pen or the site of it, from\r\nwhich nearly 11,000 victims of southern politicians were buried, being\r\nconfined in a pen without shelter, exposed to all the elements could do,\r\nto all the disease herding animals together could create, and to all\r\nthe starvation and cruelty an incompetent and intense caitiff government\r\ncould accomplish. From the conversation and almost from the recollection\r\nof the northern people this place has dropp' d, but not so in the gossip\r\nof the Salisbury people, nearly all of whom say that the half was\r\nnever told; that such was the nature of habitual outrage here that when\r\nFederal prisoners escaped the townspeople harbor'd them in their barns,\r\nafraid the vengeance of God would fall on them, to deliver even their\r\nenemies back to such cruelty. Said one old man at the Boyden House, who\r\njoin'd in the conversation one evening: 'There were often men buried out\r\nof that prison pen still alive. I have the testimony of a surgeon that\r\nhe had seen them pull'd out of the dead cart with their eyes open and\r\ntaking notice, but too weak to lift a finger. There was not the least\r\nexcuse for such treatment, as the confederate government had seized\r\nevery sawmill in the region, and could just as well have put up shelter\r\nfor these prisoners as not, wood being plentiful here. It will be hard\r\nto make any honest man in Salisbury say that there was the slightest\r\nnecessity for those prisoners having to live in old tents, caves\r\nand holes half-full of water. Representations were made to the Davis\r\ngovernment against the officers in charge of it, but no attention\r\nwas paid to them. Promotion was the punishment for cruelty there. The\r\ninmates were skeletons. Hell could have no terrors for any man who died\r\nthere, except the inhuman keepers.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF A PENNSYLVANIA SOLDIER\r\n\r\n_Frank H. Irwin, company E, 93rd Pennsylvania--died May 1, '65--My\r\nletter to his mother_--Dear madam: No doubt you and Frank's friends have\r\nheard the sad fact of his death in hospital here, through his uncle,\r\nor the lady from Baltimore, who took his things. (I have not seen them,\r\nonly heard of them visiting Frank.) I will write you a few lines--as\r\na casual friend that sat by his death-bed. Your son, corporal Frank H.\r\nIrwin, was wounded near fort Fisher, Virginia, March 25th, 1865--the\r\nwound was in the left knee, pretty bad. He was sent up to Washington,\r\nwas receiv'd in ward C, Armory-square hospital, March 28th--the wound\r\nbecame worse, and on the 4th of April the leg was amputated a little\r\nabove the knee--the operation was perform' d by Dr. Bliss, one of the\r\nbest surgeons in the army--he did the whole operation himself--there was\r\na good deal of bad matter gather'd--the bullet was found in the knee.\r\nFor a couple of weeks afterwards he was doing pretty well. I visited\r\nand sat by him frequently, as he was fond of having me. The last ten or\r\ntwelve days of April I saw that his case was critical. He previously had\r\nsome fever, with cold spells. The last week in April he was much of\r\nthe time flighty--but always mild and gentle. He died first of May. The\r\nactual cause of death was pyaemia, (the absorption of the matter in the\r\nsystem instead of its discharge.) Frank, as far as I saw, had everything\r\nrequisite in surgical treatment, nursing, &c. He had watches much of the\r\ntime. He was so good and well-behaved and affectionate, I myself liked\r\nhim very much. I was in the habit of coming in afternoons and sitting by\r\nhim, and soothing him, and he liked to have me--liked to put his arm out\r\nand lay his hand on my knee--would keep it so a long while. Toward the\r\nlast he was more restless and flighty at night--often fancied himself\r\nwith his regiment--by his talk sometimes seem'd as if his feelings\r\nwere hurt by being blamed by his officers for something he was entirely\r\ninnocent of--said, \"I never in my life was thought capable of such a\r\nthing, and never was.\" At other times he would fancy himself talking as\r\nit seem'd to children or such like, his relatives I suppose, and giving\r\nthem good advice; would talk to them a long while. All the time he was\r\nout of his head not one single bad word or idea escaped him. It was\r\nremark'd that many a man's conversation in his senses was not half as\r\ngood as Frank's delirium. He seem'd quite willing to die--he had become\r\nvery weak and had suffer'd a good deal, and was perfectly resign'd, poor\r\nboy. I do not know his past life, but I feel as if it must have\r\nbeen good. At any rate what I saw of him here, under the most trying\r\ncircumstances, with a painful wound, and among strangers, I can say\r\nthat he behaved so brave, so composed, and so sweet and affectionate,\r\nit could not be surpass'd. And now like many other noble and good men,\r\nafter serving his country as a soldier, he has yielded up his young life\r\nat the very outset in her service. Such things are gloomy--yet there\r\nis a text, \"God doeth all things well\"--the meaning of which, after due\r\ntime, appears to the soul.\r\n\r\nI thought perhaps a few words, though from a stranger, about your son,\r\nfrom one who was with him at the last, might be worth while--for I loved\r\nthe young man, though I but saw him immediately to lose him. I am merely\r\na friend visiting the hospitals occasionally to cheer the wounded and\r\nsick.\r\n\r\nW. W.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARMIES RETURNING\r\n\r\n_May 7_.--Sunday.--To-day as I was walking a mile or two south of\r\nAlexandria, I fell in with several large squads of the returning Western\r\narmy, (Sherman's men as they call'd themselves) about a thousand in all,\r\nthe largest portion of them half sick, some convalescents, on their way\r\nto a hospital camp. These fragmentary excerpts, with the unmistakable\r\nWestern physiognomy and idioms, crawling along slowly--after a great\r\ncampaign, blown this way, as it were, out of their latitude--I mark'd\r\nwith curiosity, and talk'd with off and on for over an hour. Here and\r\nthere was one very sick; but all were able to walk, except some of\r\nthe last, who had given out, and were seated on the ground, faint and\r\ndespondent. These I tried to cheer, told them the camp they were to\r\nreach was only a little way further over the hill, and so got them up\r\nand started, accompanying some of the worst a little way, and helping\r\nthem, or putting them under the support of stronger comrades.\r\n\r\n_May 21_.--Saw General Sheridan and his cavalry to-day; a strong,\r\nattractive sight; the men were mostly young, (a few middle-aged,)\r\nsuperb-looking fellows, brown, spare, keen, with well-worn clothing,\r\nmany with pieces of water-proof cloth around their shoulders, hanging\r\ndown. They dash'd along pretty fast, in wide close ranks, all spatter'd\r\nwith mud; no holiday soldiers; brigade after brigade. I could have\r\nwatch'd for a week. Sheridan stood on a balcony, under a big tree,\r\ncoolly smoking a cigar. His looks and manner impress'd me favorably.\r\n\r\n_May 22_.--Have been taking a walk along Pennsylvania avenue and Seventh\r\nstreet north. The city is full of soldiers, running around loose.\r\nOfficers everywhere, of all grades. All have the weatherbeaten look of\r\npractical service. It is a sight I never tire of. All the armies are\r\nnow here (or portions of them,) for to-morrow's review. You see them\r\nswarming like bees everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND REVIEW\r\n\r\nFor two days now the broad spaces of Pennsylvania avenue along to\r\nTreasury hill, and so by detour around to the President's house, and so\r\nup to Georgetown, and across the aqueduct bridge, have been alive with a\r\nmagnificent sight, the returning armies. In their wide ranks stretching\r\nclear across the Avenue, I watch them march or ride along, at a brisk\r\npace, through two whole days--infantry, cavalry, artillery--some 200,000\r\nmen. Some days afterwards one or two other corps; and then, still\r\nafterwards, a good part of Sherman's immense army, brought up from\r\nCharleston, Savannah, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTERN SOLDIERS\r\n\r\n_May 26-7_.--The streets, the public buildings and grounds of\r\nWashington, still swarm with soldiers from Illinois, Indiana, Ohio,\r\nMissouri, Iowa, and all the Western States. I am continually meeting and\r\ntalking with them. They often speak to me first, and always show great\r\nsociability, and glad to have a good interchange of chat. These Western\r\nsoldiers are more slow in their movements, and in their intellectual\r\nquality also; have no extreme alertness. They are larger in size, have a\r\nmore serious physiognomy, are continually looking at you as they pass in\r\nthe street. They are largely animal, and handsomely so. During the war\r\nI have been at times with the Fourteenth, Fifteenth, Seventeenth, and\r\nTwentieth Corps. I always feel drawn toward the men, and like their\r\npersonal contact when we are crowded close together, as frequently these\r\ndays in the street-cars. They all think the world of General Sherman;\r\ncall him \"old Bill,\" or sometimes \"uncle Billy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA SOLDIER ON LINCOLN\r\n\r\n_May 28_.--As I sat by the bedside of a sick Michigan soldier in\r\nhospital to-day, a convalescent from the adjoining bed rose and came to\r\nme, and presently we began talking. He was a middleaged man, belonged\r\nto the 2d Virginia regiment, but lived in Racine, Ohio, and had a family\r\nthere. He spoke of President Lincoln, and said: \"The war is over, and\r\nmany are lost. And now we have lost the best, the fairest, the truest\r\nman in America. Take him altogether, he was the best man this country\r\never produced. It was quite a while I thought very different; but some\r\ntime before the murder, that's the way I have seen it.\" There was deep\r\nearnestness in the soldier. (I found upon further talk he had known Mr.\r\nLincoln personally, and quite closely, years before.) He was a veteran;\r\nwas now in the fifth year of his service; was a cavalry man, and had\r\nbeen in a good deal of hard fighting.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO BROTHERS, ONE SOUTH, ONE NORTH\r\n\r\n_May 28-9_.--I staid to-night a long time by the bedside of a new\r\npatient, a young Baltimorean, aged about 19 years, W. S. P., (2d\r\nMaryland, southern,) very feeble, right leg amputated, can't sleep\r\nhardly at all--has taken a great deal of morphine, which, as usual,\r\nis costing more than it comes to. Evidently very intelligent and well\r\nbred--very affectionate--held on to my hand, and put it by his face, not\r\nwilling to let me leave. As I was lingering, soothing him in his pain,\r\nhe says to me suddenly, \"I hardly think you know who I am--I don't wish\r\nto impose upon you--I am a rebel soldier.\" I said I did not know that,\r\nbut it made no difference. Visiting him daily for about two weeks after\r\nthat, while he lived, (death had mark'd him, and he was quite alone,) I\r\nloved him much, always kiss'd him, and he did me. In an adjoining ward\r\nI found his brother, an officer of rank, a Union soldier, a brave and\r\nreligious man, (Col. Clifton K. Prentiss, sixth Maryland infantry,\r\nSixth corps, wounded in one of the engagements at Petersburgh, April\r\n2--linger'd, suffer'd much, died in Brooklyn, Aug. 20, '65). It was\r\nin the same battle both were hit. One was a strong Unionist, the other\r\nSecesh; both fought on their respective sides, both badly wounded, and\r\nboth brought together here after a separation of four years. Each died\r\nfor his cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME SAD CASES YET\r\n\r\n_May 31_.--James H. Williams, aged 21, 3d Virginia cavalry.-About as\r\nmark'd a case of a strong man brought low by a complication of diseases,\r\n(laryngitis, fever, debility and diarrhoea,) as I have ever seen--has\r\nsuperb physique, remains swarthy yet, and flushed and red with fever-is\r\naltogether flighty--flesh of his great breast and arms tremulous, and\r\npulse pounding away with treble quickness--lies a good deal of the time\r\nin a partial sleep, but with low muttering and groans--a sleep in which\r\nthere is no rest. Powerful as he is, and so young, he will not be able\r\nto stand many more days of the strain and sapping heat of yesterday and\r\nto-day. His throat is in a bad way, tongue and lips parch'd. When I ask\r\nhim how he feels, he is able just to articulate, \"I feel pretty bad\r\nyet, old man,\" and looks at me with his great bright eyes. Father, John\r\nWilliams, Millensport, Ohio.\r\n\r\n_June 9-10_.--I have been sitting late to-night by the bedside of a\r\nwounded captain, a special friend of mine, lying with a painful fracture\r\nof left leg in one of the hospitals, in a large ward partially vacant.\r\nThe lights were put out, all but a little candle, far from where I\r\nsat. The full moon shone in through the windows, making long, slanting\r\nsilvery patches on the floor. All was still, my friend too was silent,\r\nbut could not sleep; so I sat there by him, slowly wafting the fan, and\r\noccupied with the musings that arose out of the scene, the long shadowy\r\nward, the beautiful ghostly moonlight on the floor, the white beds, here\r\nand there an occupant with huddled form, the bed-clothes thrown off. The\r\nhospitals have a number of cases of sun-stroke and exhaustion by heat,\r\nfrom the late reviews. There are many such from the Sixth corps, from\r\nthe hot parade of day before yesterday. (Some of these shows cost the\r\nlives of scores of men.)\r\n\r\n_Sunday, Sep. 10_.--Visited Douglas and Stanton hospitals. They are\r\nquite full. Many of the cases are bad ones, lingering wounds, and old\r\nsickness. There is a more than usual look of despair on the countenances\r\nof many of the men; hope has left them. I went through the wards,\r\ntalking as usual. There are several here from the confederate army whom\r\nI had seen in other hospitals, and they recognized me. Two were in a\r\ndying condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALHOUN'S REAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nIn one of the hospital tents for special cases, as I sat to-day tending\r\na new amputation, I heard a couple of neighboring soldiers talking to\r\neach other from their cots. One down with fever, but improving, had come\r\nup belated from Charleston not long before. The other was what we now\r\ncall an \"old veteran,\" (_i.e._, he was a Connecticut youth, probably of\r\nless than the age of twenty-five years, the four last of which he had\r\nspent in active service in the war in all parts of the country.) The two\r\nwere chatting of one thing and another. The fever soldier spoke of John\r\nC. Calhoun's monument, which he had seen, and was describing it. The\r\nveteran said: \"I have seen Calhoun's monument. That you saw is not the\r\nreal monument. But I have seen it. It is the desolated, ruined south;\r\nnearly the whole generation of young men between seventeen and\r\nthirty destroyed or maim'd; all the old families used up--the rich\r\nimpoverish'd, the plantations cover'd with weeds, the slaves unloos'd\r\nand become the masters, and the name of southerner blacken'd with every\r\nshame--all that is Calhoun's real monument.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHOSPITALS CLOSING\r\n\r\n_October 3_.--There are two army hospitals now remaining. I went to the\r\nlargest of these (Douglas) and spent the afternoon and evening. There\r\nare many sad cases, old wounds, incurable sickness, and some of the\r\nwounded from the March and April battles before Richmond. Few realize\r\nhow sharp and bloody those closing battles were. Our men exposed\r\nthemselves more than usual; press'd ahead without urging. Then the\r\nsoutherners fought with extra desperation. Both sides knew that with the\r\nsuccessful chasing of the rebel cabal from Richmond, and the occupation\r\nof that city by the national troops, the game was up. The dead and\r\nwounded were unusually many. Of the wounded the last lingering driblets\r\nhave been brought to hospital here. I find many rebel wounded here, and\r\nhave been extra busy to-day 'tending to the worst cases of them with the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n_Oct., Nov. and Dec., '65--Sundays_--Every Sunday of these months\r\nvisited Harewood hospital out in the woods, pleasant and recluse, some\r\ntwo and a half or three miles north of the capitol. The situation is\r\nhealthy, with broken ground, grassy slopes and patches of oak woods, the\r\ntrees large and fine. It was one of the most extensive of the hospitals,\r\nnow reduced to four or five partially occupied wards, the numerous\r\nothers being vacant. In November, this became the last military hospital\r\nkept up by the government, all the others being closed. Cases of the\r\nworst and most incurable wounds, obstinate illness, and of poor fellows\r\nwho have no homes to go to, are found here.\r\n\r\n_Dec. 10--Sunday_--Again spending a good part of the day at Harewood.\r\nI write this about an hour before sundown. I have walk'd out for a few\r\nminutes to the edge of the woods to soothe myself with the hour and\r\nscene. It is a glorious, warm, golden-sunny, still afternoon. The only\r\nnoise is from a crowd of cawing crows, on some trees three hundred\r\nyards distant. Clusters of gnats swimming and dancing in the air in all\r\ndirections. The oak leaves are thick under the bare trees, and give a\r\nstrong and delicious perfume. Inside the wards everything is gloomy.\r\nDeath is there. As I enter'd, I was confronted by it the first thing;\r\na corpse of a poor soldier, just dead, of typhoid fever. The attendants\r\nhad just straighten'd the limbs, put coppers on the eyes, and were\r\nlaying it out.\r\n\r\n_The roads_--A great recreation, the past three years, has been in\r\ntaking long walks out from Washington, five, seven, perhaps ten miles\r\nand back; generally with my friend Peter Doyle, who is as fond of it as\r\nI am. Fine moonlight nights, over the perfect military roads, hard\r\nand smooth--or Sundays--we had these delightful walks, never to be\r\nforgotten. The roads connecting Washington and the numerous forts around\r\nthe city, made one useful result, at any rate, out of the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nTYPICAL SOLDIERS\r\n\r\nEven the typical soldiers I have been personally intimate with,--it\r\nseems to me if I were to make a list of them it would be like a city\r\ndirectory. Some few only have I mention'd in the foregoing pages--most\r\nare dead--a few yet living. There is Reuben Farwell, of Michigan,\r\n(little \"Mitch;\") Benton H. Wilson, color-bearer, 185th New York; Wm.\r\nStansberry; Manvill Winterstein, Ohio; Bethuel Smith; Capt. Simms, of\r\n51st New York, (kill'd at Petersburgh mine explosion,) Capt. Sam. Pooley\r\nand Lieut. Fred. McReady, same reg't. Also, same reg't., my brother,\r\nGeorge W. Whitman--in active service all through, four years,\r\nre-enlisting twice--was promoted, step by step, (several times\r\nimmediately after battles,) lieutenant, captain, major and lieut.\r\ncolonel--was in the actions at Roanoke, Newbern, 2d Bull Run, Chantilly,\r\nSouth Mountain, Antietam, Fredericksburgh, Vicksburgh, Jackson, the\r\nbloody conflicts of the Wilderness, and at Spottsylvania, Cold Harbor,\r\nand afterwards around Petersburgh; at one of these latter was taken\r\nprisoner, and pass'd four or five months in secesh military prisons,\r\nnarrowly escaping with life, from a severe fever, from starvation and\r\nhalf-nakedness in the winter. (What a history that 51st New York had!\r\nWent out early--march'd, fought everywhere--was in storms at sea, nearly\r\nwreck'd--storm'd forts--tramp'd hither and yon in Virginia,\r\nnight and day, summer of '62--afterwards Kentucky and\r\nMississippi--re-enlisted--was in all the engagements and campaigns, as\r\nabove.) I strengthen and comfort myself much with the certainty that\r\nthe capacity for just such regiments, (hundreds, thousands of them) is\r\ninexhaustible in the United States, and that there isn't a county nor a\r\ntownship in the republic--nor a street in any city--but could turn out,\r\nand, on occasion, would turn out, lots of just such typical soldiers,\r\nwhenever wanted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"CONVULSIVENESS\"\r\n\r\nAs I have look'd over the proof-sheets of the preceding pages, I have\r\nonce or twice fear'd that my diary would prove, at best, but a batch of\r\nconvulsively written reminiscences. Well, be it so.\r\n\r\nThey are but parts of the actual distraction, heat, smoke and excitement\r\nof those times. The war itself, with the temper of society preceding it,\r\ncan indeed be best described by that very word _convulsiveness_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE YEARS SUMM'D UP\r\n\r\nDuring those three years in hospital, camp or field, I made over six\r\nhundred visits or tours, and went, as I estimate, counting all, among\r\nfrom eighty thousand to a hundred thousand of the wounded and sick,\r\nas sustainer of spirit and body in some degree, in time of need. These\r\nvisits varied from an hour or two, to all day or night; for with dear\r\nor critical cases I generally watch'd all night. Sometimes I took up my\r\nquarters in the hospital, and slept or watch'd there several nights\r\nin succession. Those three years I consider the greatest privilege\r\nand satisfaction, (with all their feverish excitements and physical\r\ndeprivations and lamentable sights,) and, of course, the most profound\r\nlesson of my life. I can say that in my ministerings I comprehended\r\nall, whoever came in my way, northern or southern, and slighted none. It\r\narous'd and brought out and decided undream'd-of depths of emotion. It\r\nhas given me my most fervent views of the true _ensemble_ and extent of\r\nthe States. While I was with wounded and sick in thousands of cases from\r\nthe New England States, and from New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania,\r\nand from Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and all the\r\nWestern States, I was with more or less from all the States, North\r\nand South, without exception. I was with many from the border States,\r\nespecially from Maryland and Virginia, and found, during those lurid\r\nyears 1862-63, far more Union southerners, especially Tennesseans, than\r\nis supposed. I was with many rebel officers and men among our wounded,\r\nand gave them always what I had, and tried to cheer them the same as\r\nany. I was among the army teamsters considerably, and, indeed, always\r\nfound myself drawn to them. Among the black soldiers, wounded or sick,\r\nand in the contraband camps, I also took my way whenever in their\r\nneighborhood, and did what I could for them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MILLION DEAD, TOO, SUMM'D UP\r\n\r\nThe dead in this war--there they lie, strewing the fields and woods and\r\nvalleys and battle-fields of the south--Virginia, the Peninsula--Malvern\r\nhill and Fair Oaks--the banks of the Chickahominy--the terraces of\r\nFredericksburgh--Antietam bridge--the grisly ravines of Manassas--the\r\nbloody promenade of the Wilderness--the varieties of the _strayed_ dead,\r\n(the estimate of the War department is 25,000 national soldiers kill'd\r\nin battle and never buried at all, 5,000 drown'd--15,000 inhumed\r\nby strangers, or on the march in haste, in hitherto unfound\r\nlocalities--2,000 graves cover'd by sand and mud by Mississippi\r\nfreshets, 3,000 carried away by caving-in of banks, &c.,)--Gettysburgh,\r\nthe West, Southwest--Vicksburgh--Chattanooga--the trenches of\r\nPetersburgh--the numberless battles, camps, hospitals everywhere--the\r\ncrop reap'd by the mighty reapers, typhoid, dysentery,\r\ninflammations--and blackest and loathesomest of all, the dead and living\r\nburial-pits, the prison-pens of Andersonville, Salisbury, Belle-Isle,\r\n&c., (not Dante's pictured hell and all its woes, its degradations,\r\nfilthy torments, excell'd those prisons)--the dead, the dead, the\r\ndead--_our_ dead--or South or North, ours all, (all, all, all,\r\nfinally dear to me)--or East or West--Atlantic coast or Mississippi\r\nvalley--somewhere they crawl'd to die, alone, in bushes, low gullies,\r\nor on the sides of hills--(there, in secluded spots, their skeletons,\r\nbleach'd bones, tufts of hair, buttons, fragments of clothing, are\r\noccasionally found yet)--our young men once so handsome and so joyous,\r\ntaken from us--the son from the mother, the husband from the wife,\r\nthe dear friend from the dear friend--the clusters of camp graves, in\r\nGeorgia, the Carolinas, and in Tennessee--the single graves left in\r\nthe woods or by the roadside, (hundreds, thousands, obliterated)--the\r\ncorpses floated down the rivers, and caught and lodged, (dozens, scores,\r\nfloated down the upper Potomac, after the cavalry engagements, the\r\npursuit of Lee, following Gettysburgh)--some lie at the bottom of the\r\nsea--the general million, and the special cemeteries in almost all the\r\nStates--the infinite dead--(the land entire saturated, perfumed with\r\ntheir impalpable ashes' exhalation in Nature's chemistry distill'd, and\r\nshall be so forever, in every future grain of wheat and ear of corn, and\r\nevery flower that grows, and every breath we draw)--not only Northern\r\ndead leavening Southern soil--thousands, aye tens of thousands, of\r\nSoutherners, crumble to-day in Northern earth.\r\n\r\nAnd everywhere among these countless graves--everywhere in the many\r\nsoldier Cemeteries of the Nation, (there are now, I believe, over\r\nseventy of them)--as at the time in the vast trenches, the depositories\r\nof slain, Northern and Southern, after the great battles--not only where\r\nthe scathing trail passed those years, but radiating since in all\r\nthe peaceful quarters of the land--we see, and ages yet may see, on\r\nmonuments and gravestones, singly or in masses, to thousands or tens of\r\nthousands, the significant word UNKNOWN.\r\n\r\n(In some of the cemeteries nearly all the dead are unknown. At\r\nSalisbury, N. C., for instance, the known are only 85, while the unknown\r\nare 12,027, and 11,700 of these are buried in trenches. A national\r\nmonument has been put up here, by order of Congress, to mark the\r\nspot--but what visible, material monument can ever fittingly commemorate\r\nthat spot?)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REAL WAR WILL NEVER GET IN THE BOOKS\r\n\r\nAnd so good-bye to the war. I know not how it may have been, or may be,\r\nto others--to me the main interest I found, (and still, on recollection,\r\nfind,) in the rank and file of the armies, both sides, and in those\r\nspecimens amid the hospitals, and even the dead on the field. To me the\r\npoints illustrating the latent personal character and eligibilities\r\nof these States, in the two or three millions of American young\r\nand middle-aged men, North and South, embodied in those armies--and\r\nespecially the one-third or one-fourth of their number, stricken by\r\nwounds or disease at some time in the course of the contest--were of\r\nmore significance even than the political interests involved. (As so\r\nmuch of a race depends on how it faces death, and how it stands personal\r\nanguish and sickness. As, in the glints of emotions under emergencies,\r\nand the indirect traits and asides in Plutarch, we get far profounder\r\nclues to the antique world than all its more formal history.)\r\n\r\nFuture years will never know the seething hell and the black infernal\r\nbackground of countless minor scenes and interiors, (not the official\r\nsurface-courteousness of the Generals, not the few great battles) of the\r\nSecession war; and it is best they should not--the real war will never\r\nget in the books. In the mushy influences of current times, too, the\r\nfervid atmosphere and typical events of those years are in danger of\r\nbeing totally forgotten. I have at night watch'd by the side of a sick\r\nman in the hospital, one who could not live many hours. I have seen his\r\neyes flash and burn as he raised himself and recurr'd to the cruelties\r\non his surrender'd brother, and mutilations of the corpse afterward.\r\n(See in the preceding pages, the incident at Upperville--the seventeen\r\nkill'd as in the description, were left there on the ground. After they\r\ndropt dead, no one touch'd them--all were made sure of, however. The\r\ncarcasses were left for the citizens to bury or not, as they chose.)\r\n\r\nSuch was the war. It was not a quadrille in a ball-room. Its interior\r\nhistory will not only never be written--its practicality, minutia; of\r\ndeeds and passions, will never be even suggested. The actual soldier\r\nof 1862-'65, North and South, with all his ways, his incredible\r\ndauntlessness, habits, practices, tastes, language, his fierce\r\nfriendship, his appetite, rankness, his superb strength and animality,\r\nlawless gait, and a hundred unnamed lights and shades of camp, I say,\r\nwill never be written--perhaps must not and should not be.\r\n\r\nThe preceding notes may furnish a few stray glimpses into that life, and\r\ninto those lurid interiors, never to be fully convey'd to the future.\r\nThe hospital part of the drama from '61 to '65, deserves indeed to\r\nbe recorded. Of that many-threaded drama, with its sudden and strange\r\nsurprises, its confounding of prophecies, its moments of despair, the\r\ndread of foreign interference, the interminable campaigns, the bloody\r\nbattles, the mighty and cumbrous and green armies, the drafts and\r\nbounties--the immense money expenditure, like a heavy-pouring constant\r\nrain--with, over the whole land, the last three years of the struggle,\r\nan unending, universal mourning-wail of women, parents, orphans--the\r\nmarrow of the tragedy concentrated in those Army Hospitals--(it seem'd\r\nsometimes as if the whole interest of the land, North and South, was\r\none vast central hospital, and all the rest of the affair but\r\nflanges)--those forming the untold and unwritten history of the\r\nwar--infinitely greater (like life's) than the few scraps and\r\ndistortions that are ever told or written. Think how much, and\r\nof importance, will be--how much, civic and military, has already\r\nbeen--buried in the grave, in eternal darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN INTERREGNUM PARAGRAPH\r\n\r\nSeveral years now elapse before I resume my diary. I continued at\r\nWashington working in the Attorney-General's department through '66 and\r\n'67, and some time afterward. In February '73 I was stricken down by\r\nparalysis, gave up my desk, and migrated to Camden, New Jersey, where\r\nI lived during '74 and '75, quite unwell--but after that began to grow\r\nbetter; commenc'd going for weeks at a time, even for months, down in\r\nthe country, to a charmingly recluse and rural spot along Timber creek,\r\ntwelve or thirteen miles from where it enters the Delaware river.\r\nDomicil'd at the farm-house of my friends, the Staffords, near by, I\r\nlived half the time along this creek and its adjacent fields and lanes.\r\nAnd it is to my life here that I, perhaps, owe partial recovery (a\r\nsort of second wind, or semi-renewal of the lease of life) from the\r\nprostration of 1874-'75. If the notes of that outdoor life could only\r\nprove as glowing to you, reader dear, as the experience itself was to\r\nme. Doubtless in the course of the following, the fact of invalidism\r\nwill crop out, (I call myself _a half-Paralytic_ these days, and\r\nreverently bless the Lord it is no worse,) between some of the\r\nlines--but I get my share of fun and healthy hours, and shall try to\r\nindicate them. (The trick is, I find, to tone your wants and tastes low\r\ndown enough, and make much of negatives, and of mere daylight and the\r\nskies.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW THEMES ENTERED UPON\r\n\r\n_1876, '77_.--I find the woods in mid-May and early June my best places\r\nfor composition.[9] Seated on logs or stumps there, or resting on rails,\r\nnearly all the following memoranda have been jotted down. Wherever I go,\r\nindeed, winter or summer, city or country, alone at home or traveling, I\r\nmust take notes--(the ruling passion strong in age and disablement, and\r\neven the approach of--but I must not say it yet.) Then underneath the\r\nfollowing excerpta--crossing the _t's_ and dotting the _i's_ of certain\r\nmoderate movements of late years--I am fain to fancy the foundations\r\nof quite a lesson learn'd. After you have exhausted what there is in\r\nbusiness, politics, conviviality, love, and so on--have found that none\r\nof these finally satisfy, or permanently wear--what remains? Nature\r\nremains; to bring out from their torpid recesses, the affinities of\r\na man or woman with the open air, the trees, fields, the changes of\r\nseasons--the sun by day and the stars of heaven by night. We will begin\r\nfrom these convictions. Literature flies so high and is so hotly spiced,\r\nthat our notes may seem hardly more than breaths of common air, or\r\ndraughts of water to drink. But that is part of our lesson.\r\n\r\nDear, soothing, healthy, restoration-hours--after three confining years\r\nof paralysis--after the long strain of the war, and its wounds and\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n[9] Without apology for the abrupt change of field and atmosphere--after\r\nwhat I have put in the preceding fifty or sixty pages--temporary\r\nepisodes, thank heaven!--I restore my book to the bracing and buoyant\r\nequilibrium of concrete outdoor Nature, the only permanent reliance for\r\nsanity of book or human life.\r\n\r\nWho knows, (I have it in my fancy, my ambition,) but the pages now\r\nensuing may carry ray of sun, or smell of grass or corn, or call of\r\nbird, or gleam of stars by night, or snow-flakes falling fresh\r\nand mystic, to denizen of heated city house, or tired workman or\r\nworkwoman?--or may-be in sick-room or prison--to serve as cooling\r\nbreeze, or Nature's aroma, to some fever'd mouth or latent pulse.\r\n\r\n\r\nENTERING A LONG FARM-LANE\r\n\r\nAs every man has his hobby-liking, mine is for a real farm-lane fenced\r\nby old chestnut-rails gray-green with dabs of moss and lichen, copious\r\nweeds and briers growing in spots athwart the heaps of stray-pick' d\r\nstones at the fence bases--irregular paths worn between, and horse and\r\ncow tracks--all characteristic accompaniments marking and scenting\r\nthe neighborhood in their seasons--apple-tree blossoms in forward\r\nApril--pigs, poultry, a field of August buckwheat, and in another the\r\nlong flapping tassels of maize--and so to the pond, the expansion of\r\nthe creek, the secluded-beautiful, with young and old trees, and such\r\nrecesses and vistas.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SPRING AND BROOK\r\n\r\nSo, still sauntering on, to the spring under the willows--musical as\r\nsoft clinking glasses-pouring a sizeable stream, thick as my neck, pure\r\nand clear, out from its vent where the bank arches over like a\r\ngreat brown shaggy eyebrow or mouth-roof--gurgling, gurgling\r\nceaselessly--meaning, saying something, of course (if one could only\r\ntranslate it)--always gurgling there, the whole year through--never\r\ngiving out--oceans of mint, blackberries in summer--choice of light and\r\nshade--just the place for my July sun-baths and water-baths too--but\r\nmainly the inimitable soft sound-gurgles of it, as I sit there hot\r\nafternoons. How they and all grow into me, day after day--everything in\r\nkeeping--the wild, just-palpable perfume, and the dappled leaf-shadows,\r\nand all the natural-medicinal, elemental-moral influences of the spot.\r\n\r\nBabble on, O brook, with that utterance of thine! I too will express\r\nwhat I have gather'd in my days and progress, native, subterranean,\r\npast--and now thee. Spin and wind thy way--I with thee, a little while,\r\nat any rate. As I haunt thee so often, season by season, thou knowest,\r\nreckest not me, (yet why be so certain? who can tell?)--but I will learn\r\nfrom thee, and dwell on thee--receive, copy, print from thee.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EARLY SUMMER REVEILLE\r\n\r\nAway then to loosen, to unstring the divine bow, so tense, so long.\r\nAway, from curtain, carpet, sofa, book--from \"society\"--from city house,\r\nstreet, and modern improvements and luxuries--away to the primitive\r\nwinding, aforementioned wooded creek, with its untrimm'd bushes and\r\nturfy banks--away from ligatures, tight boots, buttons, and the whole\r\ncast-iron civilized life--from entourage of artificial store, machine,\r\nstudio, office, parlor--from tailordom and fashion's clothes--from any\r\nclothes, perhaps, for the nonce, the summer heats advancing, there in\r\nthose watery, shaded solitudes. Away, thou soul, (let me pick thee\r\nout singly, reader dear, and talk in perfect freedom, negligently,\r\nconfidentially,) for one day and night at least, returning to the\r\nnaked source-life of us all--to the breast of the great silent savage\r\nall-acceptive Mother. Alas! how many of us are so sodden--how many have\r\nwander'd so far away, that return is almost impossible.\r\n\r\nBut to my jottings, taking them as they come, from the heap, without\r\nparticular selection. There is little consecutiveness in dates. They run\r\nany time within nearly five or six years. Each was carelessly pencilled\r\nin the open air, at the time and place. The printers will learn this\r\nto some vexation perhaps, as much of their copy is from those\r\nhastily-written first notes.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRDS MIGRATING AT MIDNIGHT\r\n\r\nDid you ever chance to hear the midnight flight of birds passing through\r\nthe air and darkness overhead, in countless armies, changing their early\r\nor late summer habitat? It is something not to be forgotten. A friend\r\ncalled me up just after 12 last night to mark the peculiar noise of\r\nunusually immense flocks migrating north (rather late this year.) In\r\nthe silence, shadow and delicious odor of the hour, (the natural perfume\r\nbelonging to the night alone,) I thought it rare music. You could _hear_\r\nthe characteristic motion--once or twice \"the rush of mighty wings,\"\r\nbut often a velvety rustle, long drawn out--sometimes quite near--with\r\ncontinual calls and chirps, and some song-notes. It all lasted from 12\r\ntill after 3. Once in a while the species was plainly distinguishable;\r\nI could make out the bobolink, tanager, Wilson's thrush, white-crown'd\r\nsparrow, and occasionally from high in the air came the notes of the\r\nplover.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUMBLE-BEES\r\n\r\nMay-month--month of swarming, singing, mating birds--the bumble-bee\r\nmonth--month of the flowering lilac-(and then my own birth-month.) As\r\nI jot this paragraph, I am out just after sunrise, and down towards the\r\ncreek. The lights, perfumes, melodies--the blue birds, grass birds\r\nand robins, in every direction--the noisy, vocal, natural concert. For\r\nundertones, a neighboring wood-pecker tapping his tree, and the distant\r\nclarion of chanticleer. Then the fresh-earth smells--the colors, the\r\ndelicate drabs and thin blues of the perspective. The bright green of\r\nthe grass has receiv'd an added tinge from the last two days' mildness\r\nand moisture. How the sun silently mounts in the broad clear sky, on\r\nhis day's journey! How the warm beams bathe all, and come streaming\r\nkissingly and almost hot on my face.\r\n\r\nA while since the croaking of the pond-frogs and the first white of\r\nthe dog-wood blossoms. Now the golden dandelions in endless profusion,\r\nspotting the ground everywhere. The white cherry and pear-blows--the\r\nwild violets, with their blue eyes looking up and saluting my feet, as\r\nI saunter the wood-edge--the rosy blush of budding apple-trees--the\r\nlight-clear emerald hue of the wheat-fields--the darker green of the\r\nrye--a warm elasticity pervading the air--the cedar-bushes profusely\r\ndeck'd with their little brown apples--the summer fully awakening--the\r\nconvocation of black birds, garrulous flocks of them, gathering on some\r\ntree, and making the hour and place noisy as I sit near.\r\n\r\n_Later._--Nature marches in procession, in sections, like the corps of\r\nan army. All have done much for me, and still do. But for the last two\r\ndays it has been the great wild bee, the humble-bee, or \"bumble,\" as the\r\nchildren call him. As I walk, or hobble, from the farm-house down to the\r\ncreek, I traverse the before-mention'd lane, fenced by old rails, with\r\nmany splits, splinters, breaks, holes, &c., the choice habitat of those\r\ncrooning, hairy insects. Up and down and by and between these rails,\r\nthey swarm and dart and fly in countless myriads. As I wend slowly\r\nalong, I am often accompanied with a moving cloud of them. They play a\r\nleading part in my morning, midday or sunset rambles, and often dominate\r\nthe landscape in a way I never before thought of--fill the long lane,\r\nnot by scores or hundreds only, but by thousands. Large and vivacious\r\nand swift, with wonderful momentum and a loud swelling, perpetual hum,\r\nvaried now and then by something almost like a shriek, they dart to and\r\nfro, in rapid flashes, chasing each other, and (little things as they\r\nare,) conveying to me a new and pronounc'd sense of strength, beauty,\r\nvitality and movement. Are they in their mating season? or what is the\r\nmeaning of this plenitude, swiftness, eagerness, display? As I walk'd, I\r\nthought I was follow'd by a particular swarm, but upon observation I saw\r\nthat it was a rapid succession of changing swarms, one after another.\r\n\r\nAs I write, I am seated under a big wild-cherry tree--the warm day\r\ntemper'd by partial clouds and a fresh breeze, neither too heavy nor\r\nlight--and here I sit long and long, envelop'd in the deep musical\r\ndrone of these bees, flitting, balancing, darting to and fro about me\r\nby hundreds--big fellows with light yellow jackets, great glistening\r\nswelling bodies, stumpy heads and gauzy wings--humming their perpetual\r\nrich mellow boom. (Is there not a hint in it for a musical composition,\r\nof which it should be the back-ground? some bumble-bee symphony?) How\r\nit all nourishes, lulls me, in the way most needed; the open air, the\r\nrye-fields, the apple orchards. The last two days have been faultless\r\nin sun, breeze, temperature and everything; never two more perfect days,\r\nand I have enjoy'd them wonderfully. My health is somewhat better, and\r\nmy spirit at peace. (Yet the anniversary of the saddest loss and sorrow\r\nof my life is close at hand.)\r\n\r\nAnother jotting, another perfect day: forenoon, from 7 to 9, two\r\nhours envelop'd in sound of bumble-bees and bird-music. Down in the\r\napple-trees and in a neighboring cedar were three or four russet-back'd\r\nthrushes, each singing his best, and roulading in ways I never heard\r\nsurpass'd. Two hours I abandon myself to hearing them, and indolently\r\nabsorbing the scene. Almost every bird I notice has a special time in\r\nthe year--sometimes limited to a few days--when it sings its best; and\r\nnow is the period of these russet-backs. Meanwhile, up and down the\r\nlane, the darting, droning, musical bumble-bees. A great swarm again for\r\nmy entourage as I return home, moving along with me as before.\r\n\r\nAs I write this, two or three weeks later, I am sitting near the brook\r\nunder a tulip tree, 70 feet high, thick with the fresh verdure of its\r\nyoung maturity--a beautiful object--every branch, every leaf perfect.\r\nFrom top to bottom, seeking the sweet juice in the blossoms, it swarms\r\nwith myriads of these wild bees, whose loud and steady humming makes an\r\nundertone to the whole, and to my mood and the hour. All of which I\r\nwill bring to a close by extracting the following verses from Henry A.\r\nBeers's little volume:\r\n\r\n    As I lay yonder in tall grass\r\n    A drunken bumble-bee went past\r\n\r\n    Delirious with honey toddy.\r\n    The golden sash about his body\r\n    Scarce kept it in his swollen belly\r\n    Distent with honeysuckle jelly.\r\n    Rose liquor and the sweet-pea wine\r\n    Had fill' d his soul with song divine;\r\n    Deep had he drunk the warm night through,\r\n    His hairy thighs were wet with dew.\r\n    Full many an antic he had play'd\r\n    While the world went round through sleep and shade.\r\n    Oft had he lit with thirsty lip\r\n    Some flower-cup's nectar'd sweets to sip,\r\n    When on smooth petals he would slip,\r\n    Or over tangled stamens trip,\r\n    And headlong in the pollen roll'd,\r\n    Crawl out quite dusted o'er with gold;\r\n    Or else his heavy feet would stumble\r\n    Against some bud, and down he'd tumble\r\n    Amongst the grass; there lie and grumble\r\n    In low, soft bass--poor maudlin bumble!\r\n\r\n\r\nCEDAR-APPLES\r\n\r\nAs I journey'd to-day in a light wagon ten or twelve miles through the\r\ncountry, nothing pleas'd me more, in their homely beauty and novelty (I\r\nhad either never seen the little things to such advantage, or had\r\nnever noticed them before) than that peculiar fruit, with its profuse\r\nclear-yellow dangles of inch-long silk or yarn, in boundless profusion\r\nspotting the dark green cedar bushes--contrasting well with their bronze\r\ntufts--the flossy shreds covering the knobs all over, like a shock of\r\nwild hair on elfin pates. On my ramble afterward down by the creek I\r\npluck'd one from its bush, and shall keep it. These cedar-apples last\r\nonly a little while however, and soon crumble and fade.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMER SIGHTS AND INDOLENCIES\r\n\r\n_June 10th_.--As I write, 5-1/2 P.M., here by the creek, nothing can\r\nexceed the quiet splendor and freshness around me. We had a heavy\r\nshower, with brief thunder and lightning, in the middle of the day; and\r\nsince, overhead, one of those not uncommon yet indescribable skies\r\n(in quality, not details or forms) of limpid blue, with rolling\r\nsilver-fringed clouds, and a pure-dazzling sun. For underlay, trees\r\nin fulness of tender foliage--liquid, reedy, long-drawn notes of\r\nbirds--based by the fretful mewing of a querulous cat-bird, and the\r\npleasant chippering-shriek of two kingfishers. I have been watching the\r\nlatter the last half hour, on their regular evening frolic over and in\r\nthe stream; evidently a spree of the liveliest kind. They pursue each\r\nother, whirling and wheeling around, with many a jocund downward dip,\r\nsplashing the spray in jets of diamonds--and then off they swoop, with\r\nslanting wings and graceful flight, sometimes so near me I can plainly\r\nsee their dark-gray feather-bodies and milk-white necks.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNDOWN PERFUME--QUAILNOTES--THE HERMIT-THRUSH\r\n\r\n_June 19th, 4 to 6-1/2, P.M._--Sitting alone by the creek--solitude\r\nhere, but the scene bright and vivid enough--the sun shining, and quite\r\na fresh wind blowing (some heavy showers last night,) the grass and\r\ntrees looking their best--the clare-obscure of different greens,\r\nshadows, half-shadows, and the dappling glimpses of the water, through\r\nrecesses--the wild flageolet-note of a quail near by--the just-heard\r\nfretting of some hylas down there in the pond--crows cawing in the\r\ndistance--a drove of young hogs rooting in soft ground near the oak\r\nunder which I sit--some come sniffing near me, and then scamper away,\r\nwith grunts. And still the clear notes of the quail--the quiver of\r\nleaf-shadows over the paper as I write--the sky aloft, with white\r\nclouds, and the sun well declining to the west--the swift darting\r\nof many sand-swallows coming and going, their holes in a neighboring\r\nmarl-bank--the odor of the cedar and oak, so palpable, as evening\r\napproaches--perfume, color, the bronze-and-gold of nearly ripen'd\r\nwheat--clover-fields, with honey-scent--the well-up maize, with long and\r\nrustling leaves--the great patches of thriving potatoes, dusky green,\r\nfleck'd all over with white blossoms--the old, warty, venerable oak\r\nabove me--and ever, mix'd with the dual notes of the quail, the soughing\r\nof the wind through some near-by pines.\r\n\r\nAs I rise for return, I linger long to a delicious song-epilogue (is\r\nit the hermit-thrush?) from some bushy recess off there in the swamp,\r\nrepeated leisurely and pensively over and over again. This, to the\r\ncircle-gambols of the swallows flying by dozens in concentric rings in\r\nthe last rays of sunset, like flashes of some airy wheel.\r\n\r\n\r\nA JULY AFTER-NOON BY THE POND\r\n\r\nThe fervent heat, but so much more endurable in this pure air--the\r\nwhite and pink pond-blossoms, with great heart-shaped leaves; the glassy\r\nwaters of the creek, the banks, with dense bushery, and the picturesque\r\nbeeches and shade and turf; the tremulous, reedy call of some bird\r\nfrom recesses, breaking the warm, indolent, half-voluptuous silence; an\r\noccasional wasp, hornet, honey-bee or bumble (they hover near my hands\r\nor face, yet annoy me not, nor I them, as they appear to examine, find\r\nnothing, and away they go)--the vast space of the sky overhead so clear,\r\nand the buzzard up there sailing his slow whirl in majestic spirals\r\nand discs; just over the surface of the pond, two large slate-color'd\r\ndragon-flies, with wings of lace, circling and darting and occasionally\r\nbalancing themselves quite still, their wings quivering all the time,\r\n(are they not showing off for my amusement?)--the pond itself, with\r\nthe sword-shaped calamus; the water snakes--occasionally a flitting\r\nblackbird, with red dabs on his shoulders, as he darts slantingly\r\nby--the sounds that bring out the solitude, warmth, light and shade--the\r\nquawk of some pond duck--(the crickets and grasshoppers are mute in\r\nthe noon heat, but I hear the song of the first cicadas;)--then at some\r\ndistance the rattle and whirr of a reaping machine as the horses draw\r\nit on a rapid walk through a rye field on the opposite side of the\r\ncreek--(what was the yellow or light-brown bird, large as a young hen,\r\nwith short neck and long-stretch'd legs I just saw, in flapping and\r\nawkward flight over there through the trees?)--the prevailing delicate,\r\nyet palpable, spicy, grassy, clovery perfume to my nostrils; and over\r\nall, encircling all, to my sight and soul, the free space of the\r\nsky, transparent and blue--and hovering there in the west, a mass of\r\nwhite-gray fleecy clouds the sailors call \"shoals of mackerel\"--the sky,\r\nwith silver swirls like locks of toss'd hair, spreading, expanding--a\r\nvast voiceless, formless simulacrum--yet may-be the most real reality\r\nand formulator of everything--who knows?\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCUSTS AND KATY-DIDS\r\n\r\n_Aug. 22_.--Reedy monotones of locust, or sounds of katydid--I hear the\r\nlatter at night, and the other both day and night. I thought the morning\r\nand evening warble of birds delightful; but I find I can listen to these\r\nstrange insects with just as much pleasure. A single locust is now heard\r\nnear noon from a tree two hundred feet off, as I write--a long whirring,\r\ncontinued, quite loud noise graded in distinct whirls, or swinging\r\ncircles, increasing in strength and rapidity up to a certain point, and\r\nthen a fluttering, quietly tapering fall. Each strain is continued\r\nfrom one to two minutes. The locust-song is very appropriate to the\r\nscene--gushes, has meaning, is masculine, is like some fine old wine,\r\nnot sweet, but far better than sweet.\r\n\r\nBut the katydid--how shall I describe its piquant utterances? One sings\r\nfrom a willow-tree just outside my open bedroom window, twenty yards\r\ndistant; every clear night for a fortnight past has sooth'd me to sleep.\r\nI rode through a piece of woods for a hundred rods the other evening,\r\nand heard the katydids by myriads--very curious for once; but I like\r\nbetter my single neighbor on the tree. Let me say more about the song of\r\nthe locust, even to repetition; a long, chromatic, tremulous crescendo,\r\nlike a brass disk whirling round and round, emitting wave after wave\r\nof notes, beginning with a certain moderate beat or measure, rapidly\r\nincreasing in speed and emphasis, reaching a point of great energy and\r\nsignificance, and then quickly and gracefully dropping down and out. Not\r\nthe melody of the singing-bird--far from it; the common musician might\r\nthink without melody, but surely having to the finer ear a harmony of\r\nits own; monotonous--but what a swing there is in that brassy drone,\r\nround and round, cymballine--or like the whirling of brass quoits.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LESSON OF A TREE\r\n\r\n_Sept. 1_.--I should not take either the biggest or the most picturesque\r\ntree to illustrate it. Here is one of my favorites now before me, a fine\r\nyellow poplar, quite straight, perhaps 90 feet high, and four thick\r\nat the butt. How strong, vital, enduring! how dumbly eloquent! What\r\nsuggestions of imperturbability and _being_, as against the human\r\ntrait of mere _seeming_. Then the qualities, almost emotional, palpably\r\nartistic, heroic, of a tree; so innocent and harmless, yet so savage. It\r\n_is_, yet says nothing. How it rebukes by its tough and equable serenity\r\nall weathers, this gusty-temper'd little whiffet, man, that runs indoors\r\nat a mite of rain or snow. Science (or rather half-way science) scoffs\r\nat reminiscence of dryad and hamadryad, and of trees speaking. But,\r\nif they don't, they do as well as most speaking, writing, poetry,\r\nsermons--or rather they do a great deal better. I should say indeed that\r\nthose old dryad-reminiscences are quite as true as any, and profounder\r\nthan most reminiscences we get. (\"Cut this out,\" as the quack mediciners\r\nsay, and keep by you.) Go and sit in a grove or woods, with one or more\r\nof those voiceless companions, and read the foregoing, and think.\r\n\r\nOne lesson from affiliating a tree--perhaps the greatest moral lesson\r\nanyhow from earth, rocks, animals, is that same lesson of inherency, of\r\n_what is_, without the least regard to what the looker-on (the critic)\r\nsupposes or says, or whether he likes or dislikes. What worse--what more\r\ngeneral malady pervades each and all of us, our literature, education,\r\nattitude toward each other, (even toward ourselves,) than a morbid\r\ntrouble about _seems_, (generally temporarily seems too,) and no trouble\r\nat all, or hardly any, about the sane, slow-growing, perennial, real\r\nparts of character, books, friendship, marriage--humanity's invisible\r\nfoundations and hold-together? (As the all-basis, the nerve, the\r\ngreat-sympathetic, the plenum within humanity, giving stamp to\r\neverything, is necessarily invisible.)\r\n\r\n_Aug. 4, 6 P.M._--Lights and shades and rare effects on tree-foliage and\r\ngrass--transparent greens, grays, &c., all in sunset pomp and dazzle.\r\nThe clear beams are now thrown in many new places, on the quilted,\r\nseam'd, bronze-drab, lower tree-trunks, shadow'd except at this\r\nhour--now flooding their young and old columnar ruggedness with strong\r\nlight, unfolding to my sense new amazing features of silent, shaggy\r\ncharm, the solid bark, the expression of harmless impassiveness, with\r\nmany a bulge and gnarl unreck'd before. In the revealings of such light,\r\nsuch exceptional hour, such mood, one does not wonder at the old story\r\nfables, (indeed, why fables?) of people falling into love-sickness with\r\ntrees, seiz'd extatic with the mystic realism of the resistless silent\r\nstrength in them--_strength_, which after all is perhaps the last,\r\ncompletest, highest beauty.\r\n\r\n_Trees I am familiar with here_.\r\n\r\n   Oaks, (many kinds--one sturdy                       Willows.\r\n     old fellow, vital, green, bushy,                  Catalpas.\r\n     five feet thick at the butt, I sit                Persimmons.\r\n     under every day,)                                 Mountain-ash.\r\n   Cedars plenty.                                      Hickories.\r\n   Tulip trees, (_Liriodendron,_) is of                Maples, many kinds.\r\n     the magnolia family--I have                       Locusts.\r\n     seen it in Michigan and southern                  Birches.\r\n     Illinois, 140 feet high and                       Dogwood.\r\n     8 feet thick at the butt [A]; does                Pine.\r\n     not transplant well; best rais'd                  the Elm.\r\n     from seeds--(the lumbermen                        Chesnut.\r\n     call it yellow poplar.)                           Linden.\r\n   Sycamores.                                          Aspen.\r\n   Gum trees, both sweet and sour.                     Spruce.\r\n   Beeches.                                            Hornbeam.\r\n   Black-walnuts.                                      Laurel.\r\n   Sassafras.                                          Holly.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTUMN SIDE-BITS\r\n\r\n_Sept. 20_.--Under an old black oak, glossy and green, exhaling\r\naroma--amid a grove the Albic druids might have chosen--envelop'd in\r\nthe warmth and light of the noonday sun, and swarms[10] of flitting\r\ninsects--with the harsh cawing of many crows a hundred rods away--here\r\nI sit in solitude, absorbing, enjoying all. The corn, stack'd in its\r\ncone-shaped stacks, russet-color'd and sere--a large field spotted thick\r\nwith scarlet-gold pumpkins--an adjoining one of cabbages, showing\r\nwell in their green and pearl, mottled by much light and shade--melon\r\npatches, with their bulging ovals, and great silver-streak'd, ruffled,\r\nbroad-edged leaves--and many an autumn sight and sound beside--the\r\ndistant scream of a flock of guinea-hens--and pour'd over all the\r\nSeptember breeze, with pensive cadence through the tree tops.\r\n\r\n_Another Day_.--The ground in all directions strew'd with _débris_ from\r\na storm. Timber creek, as I slowly pace its banks, has ebb'd low, and\r\nshows reaction from the turbulent swell of the late equinoctial. As I\r\nlook around, I take account of stock--weeds and shrubs, knolls, paths,\r\noccasional stumps, some with smooth'd tops, (several I use as seats\r\nof rest, from place to place, and from one I am now jotting these\r\nlines,)--frequent wild-flowers, little white, star-shaped things, or the\r\ncardinal red of the lobelia, or the cherry-ball seeds of the perennial\r\nrose, or the many-threaded vines winding up and around trunks of trees.\r\n\r\n_Oct. 1, 2 and 3_.--Down every day in the solitude of the creek. A\r\nserene autumn sun and westerly breeze to-day (3d) as I sit here, the\r\nwater surface prettily moving in wind-ripples before me. On a stout old\r\nbeech at the edge, decayed and slanting, almost fallen to the stream,\r\nyet with life and leaves in its mossy limbs, a gray squirrel, exploring,\r\nruns up and down, flirts his tail, leaps to the ground, sits on his\r\nhaunches upright as he sees me, (a Darwinian hint?) and then races up\r\nthe tree again.\r\n\r\n_Oct. 4_.--Cloudy and coolish; signs of incipient winter. Yet pleasant\r\nhere, the leaves thick-falling, the ground brown with them already; rich\r\ncoloring, yellows of all hues, pale and dark-green, shades from lightest\r\nto richest red--all set in and toned down by the prevailing brown of\r\nthe earth and gray of the sky. So, winter is coming; and I yet in my\r\nsickness. I sit here amid all these fair sights and vital influences,\r\nand abandon myself to that thought, with its wandering trains of\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n[10] There is a tulip poplar within sight of Woodstown, which is twenty\r\nfeet around, three feet from the ground, four feet across about eighteen\r\nfeet up the trunk, which is broken off about three or four feet higher\r\nup. On the south side an arm has shot out from which rise two stems,\r\neach to about ninety-one or ninety-two feet from the ground. Twenty-five\r\n(or more) years since the cavity in the butt was large enough for,\r\nand nine men at one time, ate dinner therein. It is supposed twelve to\r\nfifteen men could now, at one time, stand within its trunk. The severe\r\nwinds of 1877 and 1878 did not seem to damage it, and the two stems send\r\nout yearly many blossoms, scenting the air immediately about it with\r\ntheir sweet perfume. It is entirely unprotected by other trees, on a\r\nhill.--_Woodstown, N. J., \"Register,\" April 15, '79_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SKY--DAYS AND NIGHTS--HAPPINESS\r\n\r\n_Oct. 20_.--A clear, crispy day--dry and breezy air, full of oxygen.\r\nOut of the sane, silent, beauteous miracles that envelope and fuse\r\nme--trees, water, grass, sunlight, and early frost--the one I am looking\r\nat most to-day is the sky. It has that delicate, transparent blue,\r\npeculiar to autumn, and the only clouds are little or larger white\r\nones, giving their still and spiritual motion to the great concave. All\r\nthrough the earlier day (say from 7 to 11) it keeps a pure, yet vivid\r\nblue. But as noon approaches the color gets lighter, quite gray for two\r\nor three hours--then still paler for a spell, till sun-down--which last\r\nI watch dazzling through the interstices of a knoll of big trees--darts\r\nof fire and a gorgeous show of light-yellow, liver-color and red, with a\r\nvast silver glaze askant on the water--the transparent shadows, shafts,\r\nsparkle, and vivid colors beyond all the paintings ever made.\r\n\r\nI don't know what or how, but it seems to me mostly owing to these\r\nskies, (every now and then I think, while I have of course seen them\r\nevery day of my life, I never really saw the skies before,) have had\r\nthis autumn some wondrously contented hours--may I not say perfectly\r\nhappy ones? As I have read, Byron just before his death told a friend\r\nthat he had known but three happy hours during his whole existence. Then\r\nthere is the old German legend of the king's bell, to the same point.\r\nWhile I was out there by the wood, that beautiful sunset through the\r\ntrees, I thought of Byron's and the bell story, and the notion started\r\nin me that I was having a happy hour. (Though perhaps my best moments\r\nI never jot down; when they come I cannot afford to break the charm by\r\ninditing memoranda. I just abandon myself to the mood, and let it float\r\non, carrying me in its placid extasy.)\r\n\r\nWhat is happiness, anyhow? Is this one of its hours, or the like\r\nof it?--so impalpable--a mere breath, an evanescent tinge? I am not\r\nsure--so let me give myself the benefit of the doubt. Hast Thou,\r\npellucid, in Thy azure depths, medicine for case like mine? (Ah, the\r\nphysical shatter and troubled spirit of me the last three years.) And\r\ndost Thou subtly mystically now drip it through the air invisibly upon\r\nme?\r\n\r\n_Night of Oct. 28._--The heavens unusually transparent--the stars out by\r\nmyriads--the great path of the Milky Way, with its branch, only seen\r\nof very clear nights--Jupiter, setting in the west, looks like a huge\r\nhap-hazard splash, and has a little star for companion.\r\n\r\n    Clothed in his white garments,\r\n    Into the round and clear arena slowly entered the brahmin,\r\n    Holding a little child by the hand,\r\n    Like the moon with the planet Jupiter in a cloudless night-sky.\r\n\r\n    _Old Hindu Poem._\r\n\r\n_Early in November._--At its farther end the lane already described\r\nopens into a broad grassy upland field of over twenty acres, slightly\r\nsloping to the south. Here I am accustom'd to walk for sky views and\r\neffects, either morning or sundown. To-day from this field my soul is\r\ncalm'd and expanded beyond description, the whole forenoon by the clear\r\nblue arching over all, cloudless, nothing particular, only sky and\r\ndaylight. Their soothing accompaniments, autumn leaves, the cool dry\r\nair, the faint aroma--crows cawing in the distance--two great buzzards\r\nwheeling gracefully and slowly far up there--the occasional murmur of\r\nthe wind, sometimes quite gently, then threatening through the trees--a\r\ngang of farm-laborers loading cornstalks in a field in sight, and the\r\npatient horses waiting.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLORS--A CONTRAST\r\n\r\nSuch a play of colors and lights, different seasons, different hours of\r\nthe day--the lines of the far horizon where the faint-tinged edge of the\r\nlandscape loses itself in the sky. As I slowly hobble up the lane toward\r\nday-close, an incomparable sunset shooting in molten sapphire and gold,\r\nshaft after shaft, through the ranks of the long-leaved corn, between me\r\nand the west. _Another day_--The rich dark green of the tulip-trees and\r\nthe oaks, the gray of the swamp-willows, the dull hues of the sycamores\r\nand black-walnuts, the emerald of the cedars (after rain,) and the light\r\nyellow of the beeches.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER 8, '76\r\n\r\nThe forenoon leaden and cloudy, not cold or wet, but indicating both.\r\nAs I hobble down here and sit by the silent pond, how different from the\r\nexcitement amid which, in the cities, millions of people are now waiting\r\nnews of yesterday's Presidential election, or receiving and discussing\r\nthe result--in this secluded place uncared-for, unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROWS AND CROWS\r\n\r\n_Nov. 14_.--As I sit here by the creek, resting after my walk, a warm\r\nlanguor bathes me from the sun. No sound but a cawing of crows, and no\r\nmotion but their black flying figures from over-head, reflected in the\r\nmirror of the pond below. Indeed a principal feature of the scene to-day\r\nis these crows, their incessant cawing, far or near, and their countless\r\nflocks and processions moving from place to place, and at times almost\r\ndarkening the air with their myriads. As I sit a moment writing this\r\nby the bank, I see the black, clear-cut reflection of them far below,\r\nflying through the watery looking-glass, by ones, twos, or long\r\nstrings. All last night I heard the noises from their great roost in a\r\nneighboring wood.\r\n\r\n\r\nA WINTER DAY ON THE SEA-BEACH\r\n\r\nOne bright December mid-day lately I spent down on the New Jersey\r\nsea-shore, reaching it by a little more than an hour's railroad trip\r\nover the old Camden and Atlantic. I had started betimes, fortified by\r\nnice strong coffee and a good breakfast (cook'd by the hands I love, my\r\ndear sister Lou's--how much better it makes the victuals taste, and\r\nthen assimilate, strengthen you, perhaps make the whole day comfortable\r\nafterwards.) Five or six miles at the last, our track enter'd a broad\r\nregion of salt grass meadows, intersected by lagoons, and cut up\r\neverywhere by watery runs. The sedgy perfume, delightful to my nostrils,\r\nreminded me of \"the mash\" and south bay of my native island. I could\r\nhave journey'd contentedly till night through these flat and odorous\r\nsea-prairies. From half-past 11 till 2 I was nearly all the time along\r\nthe beach, or in sight of the ocean, listening to its hoarse murmur, and\r\ninhaling the bracing and welcome breezes. First, a rapid five-mile drive\r\nover the hard sand--our carriage wheels hardly made dents in it. Then\r\nafter dinner (as there were nearly two hours to spare) I walk'd off in\r\nanother direction, (hardly met or saw a person,) and taking possession\r\nof what appear'd to have been the reception-room of an old bath-house\r\nrange, had a broad expanse of view all to myself--quaint, refreshing,\r\nunimpeded--a dry area of sedge and Indian grass immediately before and\r\naround me--space, simple, unornamented space. Distant vessels, and the\r\nfar-off, just visible trailing smoke of an inward bound steamer; more\r\nplainly, ships, brigs, schooners, in sight, most of them with every sail\r\nset to the firm and steady wind.\r\n\r\nThe attractions, fascinations there are in sea and shore! How one dwells\r\non their simplicity, even vacuity! What is it in us, arous'd by those\r\nindirections and directions? That spread of waves and gray-white beach,\r\nsalt, monotonous, senseless--such an entire absence of art, books, talk,\r\nelegance--so indescribably comforting, even this winter day--grim,\r\nyet so delicate-looking, so spiritual--striking emotional, impalpable\r\ndepths, subtler than all the poems, paintings, music, I have ever read,\r\nseen, heard. (Yet let me be fair, perhaps it is because I have read\r\nthose poems and heard that music.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSEA-SHORE FANCIES\r\n\r\nEven as a boy, I had the fancy, the wish, to write a piece, perhaps\r\na poem, about the sea-shore--that suggesting, dividing line, contact,\r\njunction, the solid marrying the liquid--that curious, lurking\r\nsomething, (as doubtless every objective form finally becomes to the\r\nsubjective spirit,) which means far more than its mere first sight,\r\ngrand as that is--blending the real and ideal, and each made portion\r\nof the other. Hours, days, in my Long Island youth and early manhood,\r\nI haunted the shores of Rockaway or Coney island, or away east to the\r\nHamptons or Montauk. Once, at the latter place, (by the old lighthouse,\r\nnothing but sea-tossings in sight in every direction as far as the eye\r\ncould reach,) I remember well, I felt that I must one day write a book\r\nexpressing this liquid, mystic theme. Afterward, I recollect, how it\r\ncame to me that instead of any special lyrical or epical or literary\r\nattempt, the sea-shore should be an invisible _influence_, a pervading\r\ngauge and tally for me, in my composition. (Let me give a hint here to\r\nyoung writers. I am not sure but I have unwittingly follow'd out the\r\nsame rule with other powers besides sea and shores--avoiding them,\r\nin the way of any dead set at poetizing them, as too big for formal\r\nhandling--quite satisfied if I could indirectly show that we have met\r\nand fused, even if only once, but enough--that we have really absorb'd\r\neach other and understand each other.)\r\n\r\nThere is a dream, a picture, that for years at intervals, (sometimes\r\nquite long ones, but surely again, in time,) has come noiselessly up\r\nbefore me, and I really believe, fiction as it is, has enter'd largely\r\ninto my practical life--certainly into my writings, and shaped and\r\ncolor'd them. It is nothing more or less than a stretch of interminable\r\nwhite-brown sand, hard and smooth and broad, with the ocean perpetually,\r\ngrandly, rolling in upon it, with slow-measured sweep, with rustle and\r\nhiss and foam, and many a thump as of low bass drums. This scene, this\r\npicture, I say, has risen before me at times for years. Sometimes I wake\r\nat night and can hear and see it plainly.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN MEMORY OF THOMAS PAINE.\r\n\r\n_Spoken at Lincoln Hall, Philadelphia, Sunday, Jan. 28, '77, for 140th\r\nanniversary of T. P.'s birthday._\r\n\r\nSome thirty-five years ago, in New York city, at Tammany hall, of\r\nwhich place I was then a frequenter, I happen'd to become quite well\r\nacquainted with Thomas Paine's perhaps most intimate chum, and certainly\r\nhis later years' very frequent companion, a remarkably fine old man,\r\nCol. Fellows, who may yet be remember'd by some stray relics of that\r\nperiod and spot. If you will allow me, I will first give a description\r\nof the Colonel himself. He was tall, of military bearing, aged about 78,\r\nI should think, hair white as snow, clean-shaved on the face, dress'd\r\nvery neatly, a tail-coat of blue cloth with metal buttons, buff vest,\r\npantaloons of drab color, and his neck, breast and wrists showing the\r\nwhitest of linen. Under all circumstances, fine manners; a good but not\r\nprofuse talker, his wits still fully about him, balanced and live\r\nand undimm'd as ever. He kept pretty fair health, though so old. For\r\nemployment--for he was poor--he had a post as constable of some of the\r\nupper courts. I used to think him very picturesque on the fringe of a\r\ncrowd holding a tall staff, with his erect form, and his superb, bare,\r\nthick-hair'd, closely-cropt white head. The judges and young lawyers,\r\nwith whom he was ever a favorite, and the subject of respect, used to\r\ncall him Aristides. It was the general opinion among them that if manly\r\nrectitude and the instincts of absolute justice remain'd vital anywhere\r\nabout New York City Hall, or Tammany, they were to be found in Col.\r\nFellows. He liked young men, and enjoy'd to leisurely talk with them\r\nover a social glass of toddy, after his day's work, (he on these\r\noccasions never drank but one glass,) and it was at reiterated meetings\r\nof this kind in old Tammany's back parlor of those days, that he told\r\nme much about Thomas Paine. At one of our interviews he gave me a minute\r\naccount of Paine's sickness and death. In short, from those talks, I\r\nwas and am satisfied that my old friend, with his mark'd advantages, had\r\nmentally, morally and emotionally gauged the author of \"Common Sense,\"\r\nand besides giving me a good portrait of his appearance and manners, had\r\ntaken the true measure of his interior character.\r\n\r\nPaine's practical demeanor, and much of his theoretical belief, was a\r\nmixture of the French and English schools of a century ago, and the best\r\nof both. Like most old-fashion'd people, he drank a glass or two every\r\nday, but was no tippler, nor intemperate, let alone being a drunkard.\r\nHe lived simply and economically, but quite well--was always cheery and\r\ncourteous, perhaps occasionally a little blunt, having very positive\r\nopinions upon politics, religion, and so forth. That he labor'd well and\r\nwisely for the States in the trying period of their parturition, and in\r\nthe seeds of their character, there seems to me no question. I dare\r\nnot say how much of what our Union is owning and enjoying to-day--its\r\nindependence--its ardent belief in, and substantial practice of\r\nradical human rights--and the severance of its government from all\r\necclesiastical and superstitious dominion--I dare not say how much of\r\nall this is owing to Thomas Paine, but I am inclined to think a good\r\nportion of it decidedly is.\r\n\r\nBut I was not going either into an analysis or eulogium of the man.\r\nI wanted to carry you back a generation or two, and give you by\r\nindirection a moment's glance--and also to ventilate a very earnest and\r\nI believe authentic opinion, nay conviction, of that time, the fruit\r\nof the interviews I have mention'd, and of questioning and\r\ncross-questioning, clench'd by my best information since, that Thomas\r\nPaine had a noble personality, as exhibited in presence, face, voice,\r\ndress, manner, and what may be call'd his atmosphere and magnetism,\r\nespecially the later years of his life. I am sure of it. Of the foul and\r\nfoolish fictions yet told about the circumstances of his decease, the\r\nabsolute fact is that as he lived a good life, after its kind, he died\r\ncalmly and philosophically, as became him. He served the embryo Union\r\nwith most precious service--a service that every man, woman and child\r\nin our thirty-eight States is to some extent receiving the benefit of\r\nto-day--and I for one here cheerfully, reverently throw my pebble on the\r\ncairn of his memory. As we all know, the season demands--or rather, will\r\nit ever be out of season?--that America learn to better dwell on her\r\nchoicest possession, the legacy of her good and faithful men--that she\r\nwell preserve their fame, if unquestion'd--or, if need be, that she fail\r\nnot to dissipate what clouds have intruded on that fame, and burnish it\r\nnewer, truer and brighter, continually.\r\n\r\n\r\nA TWO HOURS ICE-SAIL\r\n\r\n_Feb. 3, '77_--From 4 to 6 P. M. crossing the Delaware, (back again at\r\nmy Camden home,) unable to make our landing, through the ice; our boat\r\nstanch and strong and skilfully piloted, but old and sulky, and poorly\r\nminding her helm. (_Power_, so important in poetry and war, is also\r\nfirst point of all in a winter steamboat, with long stretches of\r\nice-packs to tackle.) For over two hours we bump'd and beat about,\r\nthe invisible ebb, sluggish but irresistible, often carrying us long\r\ndistances against our will. In the first tinge of dusk, as I look'd\r\naround, I thought there could not be presented a more chilling, arctic,\r\ngrim-extended, depressing scene. Everything was yet plainly visible; for\r\nmiles north and south, ice, ice, ice, mostly broken, but some big\r\ncakes, and no clear water in sight. The shores, piers, surfaces,\r\nroofs, shipping, mantled with snow. A faint winter vapor hung a fitting\r\naccompaniment around and over the endless whitish spread, and gave it\r\njust a tinge of steel and brown.\r\n\r\n_Feb. 6_.--As I cross home in the 6 P. M. boat again, the transparent\r\nshadows are filled everywhere with leisurely falling, slightly slanting,\r\ncuriously sparse but very large, flakes of snow. On the shores, near and\r\nfar, the glow of just-lit gas-clusters at intervals. The ice, sometimes\r\nin hummocks, sometimes floating fields, through which our boat goes\r\ncrunching. The light permeated by that peculiar evening haze, right\r\nafter sunset, which sometimes renders quite distant objects so\r\ndistinctly.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRING OVERTURES--RECREATIONS\r\n\r\n_Feb. 10_.--The first chirping, almost singing, of a bird to-day. Then\r\nI noticed a couple of honey-bees spirting and humming about the open\r\nwindow in the sun.\r\n\r\n_Feb. 11_.--In the soft rose and pale gold of the declining light, this\r\nbeautiful evening, I heard the first hum and preparation of awakening\r\nspring--very faint--whether in the earth or roots, or starting of\r\ninsects, I know not--but it was audible, as I lean'd on a rail (I am\r\ndown in my country quarters awhile,) and look'd long at the western\r\nhorizon. Turning to the east, Sirius, as the shadows deepen'd, came\r\nforth in dazzling splendor. And great Orion; and a little to the\r\nnorth-east the big Dipper, standing on end.\r\n\r\n_Feb. 20_.--A solitary and pleasant sundown hour at the pond, exercising\r\narms, chest, my whole body, by a tough oak sapling thick as my wrist,\r\ntwelve feet high--pulling and pushing, inspiring the good air. After\r\nI wrestle with the tree awhile, I can feel its young sap and virtue\r\nwelling up out of the ground and tingling through me from crown to toe,\r\nlike health's wine. Then for addition and variety I launch forth in my\r\nvocalism; shout declamatory pieces, sentiments, sorrow, anger, &c., from\r\nthe stock poets or plays--or inflate my lungs and sing the wild tunes\r\nand refrains I heard of the blacks down south, or patriotic songs I\r\nlearn'd in the army. I make the echoes ring, I tell you! As the twilight\r\nfell, in a pause of these ebullitions, an owl somewhere the other side\r\nof the creek sounded _too-oo-oo-oo-oo_, soft and pensive (and I fancied\r\na little sarcastic) repeated four or five times. Either to applaud the\r\nnegro songs--or perhaps an ironical comment on the sorrow, anger, or\r\nstyle of the stock poets.\r\n\r\n\r\nONE OF THE HUMAN KINKS\r\n\r\nHow is it that in all the serenity and lonesomeness of solitude, away\r\noff here amid the hush of the forest, alone, or as I have found in\r\nprairie wilds, or mountain stillness, one is never entirely without the\r\ninstinct of looking around, (I never am, and others tell me the same of\r\nthemselves, confidentially,) for somebody to appear, or start up out\r\nof the earth, or from behind some tree or rock? Is it a lingering,\r\ninherited remains of man's primitive wariness, from the wild animals? or\r\nfrom his savage ancestry far back? It is not at all nervousness or fear.\r\nSeems as if something unknown were possibly lurking in those bushes, or\r\nsolitary places. Nay, it is quite certain there is--some vital unseen\r\npresence.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN AFTERNOON SCENE\r\n\r\n_Feb. 22_.--Last night and to-day rainy and thick, till mid-afternoon,\r\nwhen the wind chopp'd round, the clouds swiftly drew off like curtains,\r\nthe clear appear'd, and with it the fairest, grandest, most wondrous\r\nrainbow I ever saw, all complete, very vivid at its earth-ends,\r\nspreading vast effusions of illuminated haze, violet, yellow,\r\ndrab-green, in all directions overhead, through which the sun beam'd--an\r\nindescribable utterance of color and light, so gorgeous yet so soft,\r\nsuch as I had never witness'd before. Then its continuance: a full hour\r\npass'd before the last of those earth-ends disappear'd. The sky behind\r\nwas all spread in translucent blue, with many little white clouds and\r\nedges. To these a sunset, filling, dominating the esthetic and soul\r\nsenses, sumptuously, tenderly, full. I end this note by the pond,\r\njust light enough to see, through the evening shadows, the western\r\nreflections in its water-mirror surface, with inverted figures of trees.\r\nI hear now and then the _flup_ of a pike leaping out, and rippling the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GATES OPENING\r\n\r\n_April 6_.--Palpable spring indeed, or the indications of it. I am\r\nsitting in bright sunshine, at the edge of the creek, the surface just\r\nrippled by the wind. All is solitude, morning freshness, negligence.\r\nFor companions my two kingfishers sailing, winding, darting, dipping,\r\nsometimes capriciously separate, then flying together. I hear their\r\nguttural twittering again and again; for awhile nothing but that\r\npeculiar sound. As noon approaches other birds warm up. The reedy notes\r\nof the robin, and a musical passage of two parts, one a clear delicious\r\ngurgle, with several other birds I cannot place. To which is join'd,\r\n(yes, I just hear it,) one low purr at intervals from some impatient\r\nhylas at the pond-edge. The sibilant murmur of a pretty stiff breeze\r\nnow and then through the trees. Then a poor little dead leaf, long\r\nfrost-bound, whirls from somewhere up aloft in one wild escaped\r\nfreedom-spree in space and sunlight, and then dashes down to the waters,\r\nwhich hold it closely and soon drown it out of sight. The bushes and\r\ntrees are yet bare, but the beeches have their wrinkled yellow leaves of\r\nlast season's foliage largely left, frequent cedars and pines yet green,\r\nand the grass not without proofs of coming fullness. And over all a\r\nwonderfully fine dome of clear blue, the play of light coming and going,\r\nand great fleeces of white clouds swimming so silently.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMON EARTH, THE SOIL\r\n\r\nThe soil, too--let others pen-and-ink the sea, the air, (as I sometimes\r\ntry)--but now I feel to choose the common soil for theme--naught else.\r\nThe brown soil here, (just between winter-close and opening spring\r\nand vegetation)--the rain-shower at night, and the fresh smell next\r\nmorning--the red worms wriggling out of the ground--the dead leaves,\r\nthe incipient grass, and the latent life underneath--the effort to start\r\nsomething--already in shelter'd spots some little flowers--the distant\r\nemerald show of winter wheat and the rye-fields--the yet naked trees,\r\nwith clear insterstices, giving prospects hidden in summer--the tough\r\nfallow and the plow-team, and the stout boy whistling to his horses for\r\nencouragement--and there the dark fat earth in long slanting stripes\r\nupturn'd.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRDS AND BIRDS AND BIRDS\r\n\r\n_A little later--bright weather_.--An unusual melodiousness, these days,\r\n(last of April and first of May) from the blackbirds; indeed all sorts\r\nof birds, darting, whistling, hopping or perch'd on trees. Never before\r\nhave I seen, heard, or been in the midst of, and got so flooded and\r\nsaturated with them and their performances, as this current month. Such\r\noceans, such successions of them. Let me make a list of those I find\r\nhere:\r\n\r\nBlack birds (plenty,) Meadow-larks (plenty,) Ring doves, Cat-birds\r\n(plenty,) Owls, Cuckoos, Woodpeckers, Pond snipes (plenty,) King-birds,\r\nCheewinks, Crows (plenty,) Quawks, Wrens, Ground robins, Kingfishers,\r\nRavens, Quails, Gray snipes, Turkey-buzzards, Eagles, Hen-hawks,\r\nHigh-holes, Yellow birds, Herons, Thrushes, Tits, Reed birds,\r\nWoodpigeons.\r\n\r\nEarly came the\r\n\r\nBlue birds, Meadow-lark, Killdeer, White-bellied swallow, Plover,\r\nSandpiper, Robin, Wilson's thrush, Woodcock, Flicker.\r\n\r\n\r\nFULL-STARR'D NIGHTS\r\n\r\n_May 2l_.--Back in Camden. Again commencing one of those unusually\r\ntransparent, full-starr'd, blue-black nights, as if to show that however\r\nlush and pompous the day may be, there is something left in the\r\nnot-day that can outvie it. The rarest, finest sample of long-drawn-out\r\nclear-obscure, from sundown to 9 o'clock. I went down to the Delaware,\r\nand cross'd and cross'd. Venus like blazing silver well up in the west.\r\nThe large pale thin crescent of the new moon, half an hour high, sinking\r\nlanguidly under a bar-sinister of cloud, and then emerging. Arcturus\r\nright overhead. A faint fragrant sea-odor wafted up from the south.\r\nThe gloaming, the temper'd coolness, with every feature of the scene,\r\nindescribably soothing and tonic--one of those hours that give hints to\r\nthe soul, impossible to put in a statement. (Ah, where would be any food\r\nfor spirituality without night and the stars?) The vacant spaciousness\r\nof the air, and the veil'd blue of the heavens, seem'd miracles enough.\r\n\r\nAs the night advanc'd it changed its spirit and garments to ampler\r\nstateliness. I was almost conscious of a definite presence, Nature\r\nsilently near. The great constellation of the Water-Serpent stretch'd\r\nits coils over more than half the heavens. The Swan with outspread wings\r\nwas flying down the Milky Way. The northern Crown, the Eagle, Lyra, all\r\nup there in their places. From the whole dome shot down points of light,\r\nrapport with me, through the clear blue-black. All the usual sense of\r\nmotion, all animal life, seem'd discarded, seem'd a fiction; a curious\r\npower, like the placid rest of Egyptian gods, took possession, none\r\nthe less potent for being impalpable. Earlier I had seen many bats,\r\nbalancing in the luminous twilight, darting their black forms hither\r\nand yon over the river; but now they altogether disappear'd. The evening\r\nstar and the moon had gone. Alertness and peace lay camly couching\r\ntogether through the fluid universal shadows.\r\n\r\n_Aug. 26_.--Bright has the day been, and my spirits an equal _forzando_.\r\nThen comes the night, different, inexpressibly pensive, with its\r\nown tender and temper'd splendor. Venus lingers in the west with a\r\nvoluptuous dazzle unshown hitherto this summer. Mars rises early, and\r\nthe red sulky moon, two days past her full; Jupiter at night's meridian,\r\nand the long curling-slanted Scorpion stretching full view in the south,\r\nAretus-neck'd. Mars walks the heavens lord-paramount now; all through\r\nthis month I go out after supper and watch for him; sometimes getting\r\nup at midnight to take another look at his unparallel'd lustre. (I see\r\nlately an astronomer has made out through the new Washington telescope\r\nthat Mars has certainly one moon, perhaps two.) Pale and distant, but\r\nnear in the heavens, Saturn precedes him.\r\n\r\n\r\nMULLEINS AND MULLEINS\r\n\r\nLarge, placid mulleins, as summer advances, velvety in texture, of a\r\nlight greenish-drab color, growing everywhere in the fields--at first\r\nearth's big rosettes in their broad-leav'd low cluster-plants, eight,\r\nten, twenty leaves to a plant--plentiful on the fallow twenty-acre\r\nlot, at the end of the lane, and especially by the ridge-sides of the\r\nfences--then close to the ground, but soon springing up--leaves as broad\r\nas my hand, and the lower ones twice as long--so fresh and dewy in the\r\nmorning--stalks now four or five, even seven or eight feet high. The\r\nfarmers, I find, think the mullein a mean unworthy weed, but I have\r\ngrown to a fondness for it. Every object has its lesson, enclosing\r\nthe suggestion of everything else--and lately I sometimes think all is\r\nconcentrated for me in these hardy, yellow-flower'd weeds. As I come\r\ndown the lane early in the morning, I pause before their soft wool-like\r\nfleece and stem and broad leaves, glittering with countless diamonds.\r\nAnnually for three summers now, they and I have silently return'd\r\ntogether; at such long intervals I stand or sit among them,\r\nmusing--and woven with the rest, of so many hours and moods of partial\r\nrehabilitation--of my sane or sick spirit, here as near at peace as it\r\ncan be.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTANT SOUNDS\r\n\r\nThe axe of the wood-cutter, the measured thud of a single\r\nthreshing-flail, the crowing of chanticleer in the barn-yard, (with\r\ninvariable responses from other barn-yards,) and the lowing of\r\ncattle--but most of all, or far or near, the wind--through the high\r\ntree-tops, or through low bushes, laving one's face and hands so gently,\r\nthis balmy-bright noon, the coolest for a long time, (Sept. 2)--I will\r\nnot call it _sighing_, for to me it is always a firm, sane, cheery\r\nexpression, through a monotone, giving many varieties, or swift or slow,\r\nor dense or delicate. The wind in the patch of pine woods off there--how\r\nsibilant. Or at sea, I can imagine it this moment, tossing the waves,\r\nwith spirits of foam flying far, and the free whistle, and the scent\r\nof the salt--and that vast paradox somehow with all its action and\r\nrestlessness conveying a sense of eternal rest.\r\n\r\n_Other adjuncts._--But the sun and the moon here and these times. As\r\nnever more wonderful by day, the gorgeous orb imperial, so vast,\r\nso ardently, lovingly hot--so never a more glorious moon of nights,\r\nespecially the last three or four. The great planets too--Mars never\r\nbefore so flaming bright, so flashing-large, with slight yellow tinge,\r\n(the astronomers say--is it true?--nearer to us than any time the past\r\ncentury)--and well up, lord Jupiter, (a little while since close by\r\nthe moon)--and in the west, after the sun sinks, voluptuous Venus, now\r\nlanguid and shorn of her beams, as if from some divine excess.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SUN-BATH-NAKEDNESS\r\n\r\n_Sunday, Aug. 27_.--Another day quite free from mark'd prostration\r\nand pain. It seems indeed as if peace and nutriment from heaven subtly\r\nfilter into me as I slowly hobble down these country lanes and across\r\nfields, in the good air--as I sit here in solitude with Nature--open,\r\nvoiceless, mystic, far removed, yet palpable, eloquent Nature. I\r\nmerge myself in the scene, in the perfect day. Hovering over the clear\r\nbrook-water, I am sooth'd by its soft gurgle in one place, and\r\nthe hoarser murmurs of its three-foot fall in another. Come, ye\r\ndisconsolate, in whom any latent eligibility is left--come get the sure\r\nvirtues of creek-shore, and wood and field. Two months (July and August,\r\n'77,) have I absorb'd them, and they begin to make a new man of me.\r\nEvery day, seclusion--every day at least two or three hours of freedom,\r\nbathing, no talk, no bonds, no dress, no books, no _manners_.\r\n\r\nShall I tell you, reader, to what I attribute my already much-restored\r\nhealth? That I have been almost two years, off and on, without drugs and\r\nmedicines, and daily in the open air. Last summer I found a particularly\r\nsecluded little dell off one side by my creek, originally a large\r\ndug-out marl-pit, now abandon'd, fill'd, with bushes, trees, grass, a\r\ngroup of willows, a straggling bank, and a spring of delicious water\r\nrunning right through the middle of it, with two or three little\r\ncascades. Here I retreated every hot day, and follow it up this summer.\r\nHere I realize the meaning of that old fellow who said he was seldom\r\nless alone than when alone. Never before did I get so close to Nature;\r\nnever before did she come so close to me. By old habit, I pencill'd down\r\nfrom time to time, almost automatically, moods, sights, hours, tints and\r\noutlines, on the spot. Let me specially record the satisfaction of\r\nthis current forenoon, so serene and primitive, so conventionally\r\nexceptional, natural.\r\n\r\nAn hour or so after breakfast I wended my way down to the recesses of\r\nthe aforesaid dell, which I and certain thrushes, cat-birds, &c.,\r\nhad all to ourselves. A light south-west wind was blowing through the\r\ntree-tops. It was just the place and time for my Adamic air-bath and\r\nflesh-brushing from head to foot. So hanging clothes on a rail near by,\r\nkeeping old broadbrim straw on head and easy shoes on feet, havn't I had\r\na good time the last two hours! First with the stiff-elastic bristles\r\nrasping arms, breast, sides, till they turn'd scarlet--then partially\r\nbathing in the clear waters of the running brook--taking everything very\r\nleisurely, with many rests and pauses--stepping about barefooted every\r\nfew minutes now and then in some neighboring black ooze, for unctuous\r\nmud-bath to my feet--a brief second and third rinsing in the crystal\r\nrunning waters--rubbing with the fragrant towel--slow negligent\r\npromenades on the turf up and down in the sun, varied with occasional\r\nrests, and further frictions of the bristle-brush--sometimes carrying\r\nmy portable chair with me from place to place, as my range is quite\r\nextensive here, nearly a hundred rods, feeling quite secure from\r\nintrusion, (and that indeed I am not at all nervous about, if it\r\naccidentally happens.)\r\n\r\nAs I walk'd slowly over the grass, the sun shone out enough to show the\r\nshadow moving with me. Somehow I seem'd to get identity with each and\r\nevery thing around me, in its condition. Nature was naked, and I was\r\nalso. It was too lazy, soothing, and joyous-equable to speculate\r\nabout. Yet I might have thought somehow in this vein: Perhaps the inner\r\nnever-lost rapport we hold with earth, light, air, trees, &c., is not to\r\nbe realized through eyes and mind only, but through the whole corporeal\r\nbody, which I will not have blinded or bandaged any more than the eyes.\r\nSweet, sane, still Nakedness in Nature!--ah if poor, sick, prurient\r\nhumanity in cities might really know you once more! Is not nakedness\r\nthen indecent? No, not inherently. It is your thought, your\r\nsophistication, your tear, your respectability, that is indecent. There\r\ncome moods when these clothes of ours are not only too irksome to wear,\r\nbut are themselves indecent. Perhaps indeed he or she to whom the free\r\nexhilarating extasy of nakedness in Nature has never been eligible (and\r\nhow many thousands there are!) has not really known what purity is--nor\r\nwhat faith or art or health really is. (Probably the whole curriculum\r\nof first-class philosophy, beauty, heroism, form, illustrated by the\r\nold Hellenic race--the highest height and deepest depth known to\r\ncivilization in those departments--came from their natural and religious\r\nidea of Nakedness.)\r\n\r\nMany such hours, from time to time, the last two summers--I attribute my\r\npartial rehabilitation largely to them. Some good people may think it a\r\nfeeble or half-crack'd way of spending one's time and thinking. May-be\r\nit is.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OAKS AND I\r\n\r\n_Sept. 5, '77._--I write this, 11 A.M., shelter'd under a dense oak\r\nby the bank, where I have taken refuge from a sudden rain. I came down\r\nhere, (we had sulky drizzles all the morning, but an hour ago a lull,)\r\nfor the before-mention'd daily and simple exercise I am fond of--to\r\npull on that young hickory sapling out there--to sway and yield to its\r\ntough-limber upright stem--haply to get into my old sinews some of\r\nits elastic fibre and clear sap. I stand on the turf and take these\r\nhealth-pulls moderately and at intervals for nearly an hour, inhaling\r\ngreat draughts of fresh air. Wandering by the creek, I have three or\r\nfour naturally favorable spots where I rest--besides a chair I lug with\r\nme and use for more deliberate occasions. At other spots convenient I\r\nhave selected, besides the hickory just named, strong and limber boughs\r\nof beech or holly, in easy-reaching distance, for my natural gymnasia,\r\nfor arms, chest, trunk-muscles. I can soon feel the sap and sinew rising\r\nthrough me, like mercury to heat. I hold on boughs or slender trees\r\ncaressingly there in the sun and shade, wrestle with their innocent\r\nstalwartness--and _know_ the virtue thereof passes from them into me.\r\n(Or may-be we interchange--may-be the trees are more aware of it all\r\nthan I ever thought.)\r\n\r\nBut now pleasantly imprison'd here under the big oak--the rain dripping,\r\nand the sky cover'd with leaden clouds--nothing but the pond on one\r\nside, and the other a spread of grass, spotted with the milky blossoms\r\nof the wild carrot--the sound of an axe wielded at some distant\r\nwood-pile--yet in this dull scene, (as most folks would call it,) why am\r\nI so (almost) happy here and alone? Why would any intrusion, even from\r\npeople I like, spoil the charm? But am I alone? Doubtless there comes a\r\ntime--perhaps it has come to me--when one feels through his whole being,\r\nand pronouncedly the emotional part, that identity between himself\r\nsubjectively and Nature objectively which Schelling and Fichte are so\r\nfond of pressing. How it is I know not, but I often realize a presence\r\nhere--in clear moods I am certain of it, and neither chemistry nor\r\nreasoning nor esthetics will give the least explanation. All the past\r\ntwo summers it has been strengthening and nourishing my sick body and\r\nsoul, as never before. Thanks, invisible physician, for thy silent\r\ndelicious medicine, thy day and night, thy waters and thy airs, the\r\nbanks, the grass, the trees, and e'en the weeds!\r\n\r\n\r\nA QUINTETTE\r\n\r\nWhile I have been kept by the rain under the shelter of my great oak,\r\n(perfectly dry and comfortable, to the rattle of the drops all around,)\r\nI have pencill'd off the mood of the hour in a little quintette, which I\r\nwill give you:\r\n\r\n    At vacancy with Nature,\r\n    Acceptive and at ease,\r\n    Distilling the present hour,\r\n    Whatever, wherever it is,\r\n    And over the past, oblivion.\r\n\r\nCan you get hold of it, reader dear? and how do you like it anyhow?\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST FROST--MEMS\r\n\r\nWhere I was stopping I saw the first palpable frost, on my sunrise walk,\r\nOctober 6; all over the yet-green spread a light blue-gray veil, giving\r\na new show to the entire landscape. I had but little time to notice it,\r\nfor the sun rose cloudless and mellow-warm, and as I returned along the\r\nlane it had turn'd to glittering patches of wet. As I walk I notice\r\nthe bursting pods of wild-cotton, (Indian hemp they call it here,) with\r\nflossy-silky contents, and dark red-brown seeds--a startled rabbit--I\r\npull a handful of the balsamic life-ever-lasting and stuff it down in my\r\ntrowsers-pocket for scent.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE YOUNG MEN'S DEATHS\r\n\r\n_December 20_.--Somehow I got thinking to-day of young men's deaths--not\r\nat all sadly or sentimentally, but gravely, realistically, perhaps a\r\nlittle artistically. Let me give the following three cases from budgets\r\nof personal memoranda, which I have been turning over, alone in my room,\r\nand resuming and dwelling on, this rainy afternoon. Who is there to whom\r\nthe theme does not come home? Then I don't know how it may be to\r\nothers, but to me not only is there nothing gloomy or depressing in such\r\ncases--on the contrary, as reminiscences, I find them soothing, bracing,\r\ntonic.\r\n\r\nERASTUS HASKELL.--[I just transcribe verbatim from a letter written by\r\nmyself in one of the army hospitals, 16 years ago, during the secession\r\nwar.] _Washington, July 28, 1863._--Dear M.,--I am writing this in the\r\nhospital, sitting by the side of a soldier, I do not expect to last many\r\nhours. His fate has been a hard one--he seems to be only about 19 or\r\n20--Erastus Haskell, company K, 141st N. Y.--has been out about a year,\r\nand sick or half-sick more than half that time--has been down on the\r\npeninsula--was detail'd to go in the band as fifer-boy. While sick, the\r\nsurgeon told him to keep up with the rest--(probably work'd and march'd\r\ntoo long.) He is a shy, and seems to me a very sensible boy--has fine\r\nmanners--never complains--was sick down on the peninsula in an old\r\nstorehouse--typhoid fever. The first week this July was brought up\r\nhere--journey very bad, no accommodations, no nourishment, nothing\r\nbut hard jolting, and exposure enough to make a well man sick; (these\r\nfearful journeys do the job for many)--arrived here July 11th--a silent\r\ndark-skinn'd Spanish-looking youth, with large very dark blue eyes,\r\npeculiar looking. Doctor F. here made light of his sickness--said he\r\nwould recover soon, etc.; but I thought very different, and told F.\r\nso repeatedly; (I came near quarreling with him about it from the\r\nfirst)--but he laugh'd, and would not listen to me. About four days ago,\r\nI told Doctor he would in my opinion lose the boy without doubt--but F.\r\nagain laugh'd at me. The next day he changed his opinion--brought the\r\nhead surgeon of the post--he said the boy would probably die, but they\r\nwould make a hard fight for him.\r\n\r\nThe last two days he has been lying panting for breath--a pitiful\r\nsight. I have been with him some every day or night since he arrived. He\r\nsuffers a great deal with the heat--says little or nothing--is flighty\r\nthe last three days, at times--knows me always, however--calls me\r\n\"Walter\"--(sometimes calls the name over and over and over again,\r\nmusingly, abstractedly, to himself.) His father lives at Breesport,\r\nChemung county, N. Y., is a mechanic with large family--is a steady,\r\nreligious man; his mother too is living. I have written to them, and\r\nshall write again to-day--Erastus has not receiv'd a word from home for\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nAs I sit here writing to you, M., I wish you could see the whole scene.\r\nThis young man lies within reach of me, flat on his back, his hands\r\nclasp'd across his breast, his thick black hair cut close; he is dozing,\r\nbreathing hard, every breath a spasm--it looks so cruel. He is a noble\r\nyoungster,--I consider him past all hope. Often there is no one with him\r\nfor a long while. I am here as much as possible.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM ALCOTT, fireman. _Camden, Nov., 1874_.--Last Monday afternoon\r\nhis widow, mother, relatives, mates of the fire department, and his\r\nother friends, (I was one, only lately it is true, but our love grew\r\nfast and close, the days and nights of those eight weeks by the chair\r\nof rapid decline, and the bed of death,) gather'd to the funeral of\r\nthis young man, who had grown up, and was well-known here. With nothing\r\nspecial, perhaps, to record, I would give a word or two to his memory.\r\nHe seem'd to me not an inappropriate specimen in character and elements,\r\nof that bulk of the average good American race that ebbs and flows\r\nperennially beneath this scum of eructations on the surface. Always very\r\nquiet in manner, neat in person and dress, good temper'd--punctual and\r\nindustrious at his work, till he could work no longer--he just lived his\r\nsteady, square, unobtrusive life, in its own humble sphere, doubtless\r\nunconscious of itself. (Though I think there were currents of emotion\r\nand intellect undevelop'd beneath, far deeper than his acquaintances\r\never suspected--or than he himself ever did.) He was no talker. His\r\ntroubles, when he had any, he kept to himself. As there was nothing\r\nquerulous about him in life, he made no complaints during his last\r\nsickness. He was one of those persons that while his associates never\r\nthought of attributing any particular talent or grace to him, yet all\r\ninsensibly, really, liked Billy Alcott.\r\n\r\nI, too, loved him. At last, after being with him quite a good\r\ndeal--after hours and days of panting for breath, much of the time\r\nunconscious, (for though the consumption that had been lurking in his\r\nsystem, once thoroughly started, made rapid progress, there was still\r\ngreat vitality in him, and indeed for four or five days he lay\r\ndying, before the close,) late on Wednesday night, Nov. 4th, where we\r\nsurrounded his bed in silence, there came a lull--a longer drawn breath,\r\na pause, a faint sigh--another--a weaker breath, another sigh--a pause\r\nagain and just a tremble--and the face of the poor wasted young man (he\r\nwas just 26,) fell gently over, in death, on my hand, on the pillow.\r\n\r\nCHARLES CASWELL.--[I extract the following, verbatim, from a letter\r\nto me dated September 29, from my friend John Burroughs, at\r\nEsopus-on-Hudson, New York State.] S. was away when your picture came,\r\nattending his sick brother, Charles--who has since died--an event that\r\nhas sadden'd me much. Charlie was younger than S., and a most attractive\r\nyoung fellow. He work'd at my father's and had done so for two years.\r\nHe was about the best specimen of a young country farm-hand I ever knew.\r\nYou would have loved him. He was like one of your poems. With his\r\ngreat strength, his blond hair, his cheerfulness and contentment, his\r\nuniversal good will, and his silent manly ways, he was a youth hard to\r\nmatch. He was murder'd by an old doctor. He had typhoid fever, and the\r\nold fool bled him twice. He lived to wear out the fever, but had not\r\nstrength to rally. He was out of his head nearly all the time. In the\r\nmorning, as he died in the afternoon, S. was standing over him, when\r\nCharlie put up his arms around S.'s neck, and pull'd his face down and\r\nkiss'd him. S. said he knew then the end was near. (S. stuck to him day\r\nand night to the last.) When I was home in August, Charlie was cradling\r\non the hill, and it was a picture to see him walk through the grain. All\r\nwork seem'd play to him. He had no vices, any more than Nature has, and\r\nwas belov'd by all who knew him.\r\n\r\nI have written thus to you about him, for such young men belong to\r\nyou; he was of your kind. I wish you could have known him. He had the\r\nsweetness of a child, and the strength and courage and readiness of a\r\nyoung Viking. His mother and father are poor; they have a rough, hard\r\nfarm. His mother works in the field with her husband when the work\r\npresses. She has had twelve children.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY DAYS\r\n\r\n_February 7, 1878_.--Glistening sun today, with slight haze, warm\r\nenough, and yet tart, as I sit here in the open air, down in my country\r\nretreat, under an old cedar. For two hours I have been idly wandering\r\naround the woods and pond, lugging my chair, picking out choice spots to\r\nsit awhile--then up and slowly on again. All is peace here. Of course,\r\nnone of the summer noises or vitality; to-day hardly even the winter\r\nones. I amuse myself by exercising my voice in recitations, and in\r\nringing the changes on all the vocal and alphabetical sounds. Not even\r\nan echo; only the cawing of a solitary crow, flying at some distance.\r\nThe pond is one bright, flat spread, without a ripple--a vast Claude\r\nLorraine glass, in which I study the sky, the light, the leafless trees,\r\nand an occasional crow, with flapping wings, flying overhead. The brown\r\nfields have a few white patches of snow left.\r\n\r\n_Feb. 9_.--After an hour's ramble, now retreating, resting, sitting\r\nclose by the pond, in a warm nook, writing this, shelter'd from the\r\nbreeze, just before noon. The _emotional_ aspects and influences of\r\nNature! I, too, like the rest, feel these modern tendencies (from all\r\nthe prevailing intellections, literature and poems,) to turn everything\r\nto pathos, ennui, morbidity, dissatisfaction, death. Yet how clear it is\r\nto me that those are not the born results, influences of Nature at all,\r\nbut of one's own distorted, sick or silly soul. Here, amid this wild,\r\nfree scene, how healthy, how joyous, how clean and vigorous and sweet!\r\n\r\n_Mid-afternoon_.--One of my nooks is south of the barn, and here I am\r\nsitting now, on a log, still basking in the sun, shielded from the wind.\r\nNear me are the cattle, feeding on corn-stalks. Occasionally a cow or\r\nthe young bull (how handsome and bold he is!) scratches and munches\r\nthe far end of the log on which I sit. The fresh milky odor is quite\r\nperceptible, also the perfume of hay from the barn. The perpetual rustle\r\nof dry corn-stalks, the low sough of the wind round the barn gables, the\r\ngrunting of pigs, the distant whistle of a locomotive, and occasional\r\ncrowing of chanticleers, are the sounds.\r\n\r\n_Feb. 19._--Cold and sharp last night--clear and not much wind--the full\r\nmoon shining, and a fine spread of constellations and little and big\r\nstars--Sirius very bright, rising early, preceded by many-orb'd Orion,\r\nglittering, vast, sworded, and chasing with his dog. The earth hard\r\nfrozen, and a stiff glare of ice over the pond. Attracted by the calm\r\nsplendor of the night, I attempted a short walk, but was driven back\r\nby the cold. Too severe for me also at 9 o'clock, when I came out this\r\nmorning, so I turn'd back again. But now, near noon, I have walk'd\r\ndown the lane, basking all the way in the sun (this farm has a pleasant\r\nsoutherly exposure,) and here I am, seated under the lee of a bank,\r\nclose by the water. There are bluebirds already flying about, and I\r\nhear much chirping and twittering and two or three real songs, sustain'd\r\nquite awhile, in the mid-day brilliance and warmth. (There! that is a\r\ntrue carol, coming out boldly and repeatedly, as if the singer meant\r\nit.) Then as the noon strengthens, the reedy trill of the robin--to my\r\near the most cheering of bird-notes. At intervals, like bars and breaks\r\n(out of the low murmur that in any scene, however quiet, is never\r\nentirely absent to a delicate ear,) the occasional crunch and cracking\r\nof the ice-glare congeal'd over the creek, as it gives way to the\r\nsunbeams--sometimes with low sigh--sometimes with indignant, obstinate\r\ntug and snort.\r\n\r\n(Robert Burns says in one of his letters: \"There is scarcely any earthly\r\nobject gives me more--I do not know if I should call it pleasure--but\r\nsomething which exalts me--something which enraptures me--than to walk\r\nin the shelter' d side of a wood in a cloudy winter day, and hear the\r\nstormy wind howling among the trees, and raving over the plain. It is\r\nmy best season of devotion.\" Some of his most characteristic poems were\r\ncomposed in such scenes and seasons.)\r\n\r\n\r\nA MEADOW LARK\r\n\r\n_March 16_.--Fine, clear, dazzling morning, the sun an hour high, the\r\nair just tart enough. What a stamp in advance my whole day receives\r\nfrom the song of that meadow lark perch'd on a fence-stake twenty rods\r\ndistant! Two or three liquid-simple notes, repeated at intervals,\r\nfull of careless happiness and hope. With its peculiar shimmering slow\r\nprogress and rapid-noiseless action of the wings, it flies on a way,\r\nlights on another stake, and so on to another, shimmering and singing\r\nmany minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNDOWN LIGHTS\r\n\r\n_May 6, 5 P. M._--This is the hour for strange effects in light and\r\nshade-enough to make a colorist go delirious--long spokes of molten\r\nsilver sent horizontally through the trees (now in their brightest\r\ntenderest green,) each leaf and branch of endless foliage a lit-up\r\nmiracle, then lying all prone on the youthful-ripe, interminable grass,\r\nand giving the blades not only aggregate but individual splendor, in\r\nways unknown to any other hour. I have particular spots where I get\r\nthese effects in their perfection. One broad splash lies on the\r\nwater, with many a rippling twinkle, offset by the rapidly deepening\r\nblack-green murky-transparent shadows behind, and at intervals all along\r\nthe banks. These, with great shafts of horizontal fire thrown among the\r\ntrees and along the grass as the sun lowers, give effects more and more\r\npeculiar, more and more superb, unearthly, rich and dazzling.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOUGHTS UNDER AN OAK--A DREAM\r\n\r\n_June 2_.--This is the fourth day of a dark northeast storm, wind and\r\nrain. Day before yesterday was my birthday. I have now enter'd on\r\nmy 60th year. Every day of the storm, protected by overshoes and a\r\nwaterproof blanket, I regularly come down to the pond, and ensconce\r\nmyself under the lee of the great oak; I am here now writing these\r\nlines. The dark smoke-color'd clouds roll in furious silence athwart the\r\nsky; the soft green leaves dangle all around me; the wind steadily keeps\r\nup its hoarse, soothing music over my head--Nature's mighty whisper.\r\nSeated here in solitude I have been musing over my life--connecting\r\nevents, dates, as links of a chain, neither sadly nor cheerily, but\r\nsomehow, to-day here under the oak, in the rain, in an unusually\r\nmatter-of-fact spirit.\r\n\r\nBut my great oak--sturdy, vital, green-five feet thick at the butt. I\r\nsit a great deal near or under him. Then the tulip tree near by--the\r\nApollo of the woods--tall and graceful, yet robust and sinewy,\r\ninimitable in hang of foliage and throwing-out of limb; as if the\r\nbeauteous, vital, leafy creature could walk, if it only would. (I had\r\na sort of dream-trance the other day, in which I saw my favorite trees\r\nstep out and promenade up, down and around, very curiously--with a\r\nwhisper from one, leaning down as he pass'd me, _We do all this on the\r\npresent occasion, exceptionally, just for you_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOVER AND HAY PERFUME\r\n\r\n_July 3d, 4th, 5th._--Clear, hot, favorable weather--has been a good\r\nsummer--the growth of clover and grass now generally mow'd. The familiar\r\ndelicious perfume fills the barns and lanes. As you go along you see the\r\nfields of grayish white slightly tinged with yellow, the loosely stack'd\r\ngrain, the slow-moving wagons passing, and farmers in the fields with\r\nstout boys pitching and loading the sheaves. The corn is about beginning\r\nto tassel. All over the middle and southern states the spear-shaped\r\nbattalia, multitudinous, curving, flaunting--long, glossy, dark-green\r\nplumes for the great horseman, earth. I hear the cheery notes of my old\r\nacquaintance Tommy quail; but too late for the whip-poor-will, (though\r\nI heard one solitary lingerer night before last.) I watch the broad\r\nmajestic flight of a turkey-buzzard, sometimes high up, sometimes low\r\nenough to see the lines of his form, even his spread quills, in relief\r\nagainst the sky. Once or twice lately I have seen an eagle here at early\r\ncandle-light flying low.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN UNKNOWN\r\n\r\n_June 15_.--To-day I noticed a new large bird, size of a nearly grown\r\nhen--a haughty, white-bodied dark-wing'd hawk--I suppose a hawk from his\r\nbill and general look--only he had a clear, loud, quite musical, sort of\r\nbell-like call, which he repeated again and again, at intervals, from a\r\nlofty dead tree-top, overhanging the water. Sat there a long time, and I\r\non the opposite bank watching him. Then he darted down, skimming pretty\r\nclose to the stream--rose slowly, a magnificent sight, and sail'd with\r\nsteady wide-spread wings, no flapping at all, up and down the pond\r\ntwo or three times, near me, in circles in clear sight, as if for my\r\ndelectation. Once he came quite close over my head; I saw plainly his\r\nhook'd bill and hard restless eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRD-WHISTLING\r\n\r\nHow much music (wild, simple, savage, doubtless, but so tart-sweet,)\r\nthere is in mere whistling. It is four-fifths of the utterance of birds.\r\nThere are all sorts and styles. For the last half-hour, now, while I\r\nhave been sitting here, some feather'd fellow away off in the bushes has\r\nbeen repeating over and over again what I may call a kind of throbbing\r\nwhistle. And now a bird about the robin size has just appear'd, all\r\nmulberry red, flitting among the bushes--head, wings, body, deep red,\r\nnot very bright--no song, as I have heard. _4. o'clock_: There is a real\r\nconcert going on around me--a dozen different birds pitching in with\r\na will. There have been occasional rains, and the growths all show its\r\nvivifying influences. As I finish this, seated on a log close by the\r\npond-edge, much chirping and trilling in the distance, and a feather'd\r\nrecluse in the woods near by is singing deliciously--not many notes,\r\nbut full of music of almost human sympathy--continuing for a long, long\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORSE-MINT\r\n\r\n_Aug. 22_.--Not a human being, and hardly the evidence of one, in\r\nsight. After my brief semi-daily bath, I sit here for a bit, the\r\nbrook musically brawling, to the chromatic tones of a fretful cat-bird\r\nsomewhere off in the bushes. On my walk hither two hours since, through\r\nfields and the old lane, I stopt to view, now the sky, now the mile-off\r\nwoods on the hill, and now the apple orchards. What a contrast from\r\nNew York's or Philadelphia's streets! Everywhere great patches of\r\ndingy-blossom'd horse-mint wafting a spicy odor through the air,\r\n(especially evenings.) Everywhere the flowering boneset, and the\r\nrose-bloom of the wild bean.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE OF US\r\n\r\n_July 14_.--My two kingfishers still haunt the pond. In the bright sun\r\nand breeze and perfect temperature of to-day, noon, I am sitting here\r\nby one of the gurgling brooks, dipping a French water-pen in the limpid\r\ncrystal, and using it to write these lines, again watching the feather'd\r\ntwain, as they fly and sport athwart the water, so close, almost\r\ntouching into its surface. Indeed there seem to be three of us. For\r\nnearly an hour I indolently look and join them while they dart and turn\r\nand take their airy gambols, sometimes far up the creek disappearing for\r\na few moments, and then surely returning again, and performing most\r\nof their flight within sight of me, as if they knew I appreciated and\r\nabsorb'd their vitality, spirituality, faithfulness, and the rapid,\r\nvanishing, delicate lines of moving yet quiet electricity they draw for\r\nme across the spread of the grass, the trees, and the blue sky. While\r\nthe brook babbles, babbles, and the shadows of the boughs dapple in the\r\nsunshine around me, and the cool west-by-nor'-west wind faintly soughs\r\nin the thick bushes and tree tops.\r\n\r\nAmong the objects of beauty and interest now beginning to appear quite\r\nplentifully in this secluded spot, I notice the humming-bird, the\r\ndragon-fly with its wings of slate-color'd guaze, and many varieties of\r\nbeautiful and plain butterflies, idly flapping among the plants and wild\r\nposies. The mullein has shot up out of its nest of broad leaves, to a\r\ntall stalk towering sometimes five or six feet high, now studded\r\nwith knobs of golden blossoms. The milk-weed, (I see a great gorgeous\r\ncreature of gamboge and black lighting on one as I write,) is in flower,\r\nwith its delicate red fringe; and there are profuse clusters of a\r\nfeathery blossom waving in the wind on taper stems. I see lots of these\r\nand much else in every direction, as I saunter or sit. For the last half\r\nhour a bird has persistently kept up a simple, sweet, melodious song,\r\nfrom the bushes. (I have a positive conviction that some of these birds\r\nsing, and others fly and flirt about here for my special benefit.)\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT\r\n\r\n_New York City_.--Came on from West Philadelphia, June 13, in the 2 P.\r\nM. train to Jersey City, and so across and to my friends, Mr. and Mrs.\r\nJ. H. J., and their large house, large family (and large hearts,)\r\namid which I feel at home, at peace--away up on Fifth avenue, near\r\nEighty-sixth street, quiet, breezy, overlooking the dense woody\r\nfringe of the park--plenty of space and sky, birds chirping, and air\r\ncomparatively fresh and odorless. Two hours before starting, saw the\r\nannouncement of William Cullen Bryant's funeral, and felt a strong\r\ndesire to attend. I had known Mr. Bryant over thirty years ago, and he\r\nhad been markedly kind to me. Off and on, along that time for years as\r\nthey pass'd, we met and chatted together. I thought him very sociable in\r\nhis way, and a man to become attach'd to. We were both walkers, and when\r\nI work'd in Brooklyn he several times came over, middle of afternoons,\r\nand we took rambles miles long, till dark, out towards Bedford or\r\nFlatbush, in company. On these occasions he gave me clear accounts\r\nof scenes in Europe--the cities, looks, architecture, art, especially\r\nItaly--where he had travel'd a good deal.\r\n\r\n_June 14.--The Funeral_.--And so the good, stainless, noble old citizen\r\nand poet lies in the closed coffin there--and this is his funeral. A\r\nsolemn, impressive, simple scene, to spirit and senses. The remarkable\r\ngathering of gray heads, celebrities--the finely render'd anthem, and\r\nother music--the church, dim even now at approaching noon, in its light\r\nfrom the mellow-stain'd windows-the pronounc'd eulogy on the bard who\r\nloved Nature so fondly, and sung so well her shows and seasons--ending\r\nwith these appropriate well-known lines:\r\n\r\n    I gazed upon the glorious sky,\r\n      And the green mountains round,\r\n    And thought that when I came to lie\r\n      At rest within the ground,\r\n    'Twere pleasant that in flowery June,\r\n    When brooks send up a joyous tune,\r\n      And groves a cheerful sound,\r\n    The sexton's hand, my grave to make,\r\n    The rich green mountain turf should break.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAUNT UP THE HUDSON\r\n\r\n_June 20th_.--On the \"Mary Powell,\" enjoy'd everything beyond precedent.\r\nThe delicious tender summer day, just warm enough--the constantly\r\nchanging but ever beautiful panorama on both sides of the river--(went\r\nup near a hundred miles)--the high straight walls of the stony\r\nPalisades--beautiful Yonkers, and beautiful Irvington--the never-ending\r\nhills, mostly in rounded lines, swathed with verdure,--the distant\r\nturns, like great shoulders in blue veils--the frequent gray and\r\nbrown of the tall-rising rocks--the river itself, now narrowing, now\r\nexpanding--the white sails of the many sloops, yachts, &c., some near,\r\nsome in the distance--the rapid succession of handsome villages and\r\ncities, (our boat is a swift traveler, and makes few stops)--the\r\nRace--picturesque West Point, and indeed all along--the costly and often\r\nturreted mansions forever showing in some cheery light color, through\r\nthe woods--make up the scene.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAPPINESS AND RASPBERRIES\r\n\r\n_June 21_.--Here I am, on the west bank of the Hudson, 80 miles\r\nnorth of New York, near Esopus, at the handsome, roomy,\r\nhoneysuckle-and-rose-enbower'd cottage of John Burroughs. The place,\r\nthe perfect June days and nights, (leaning toward crisp and cool,)\r\nthe hospitality of J. and Mrs. B., the air, the fruit, (especially my\r\nfavorite dish, currants and raspberries, mixed, sugar'd, fresh and ripe\r\nfrom the bushes--I pick 'em myself)--the room I occupy at night, the\r\nperfect bed, the window giving an ample view of the Hudson and the\r\nopposite shores, so wonderful toward sunset, and the rolling music\r\nof the RR. trains, far over there--the peaceful rest--the early\r\nVenus-heralded dawn--the noiseless splash of sunrise, the light and\r\nwarmth indescribably glorious, in which, (soon as the sun is well up,)\r\nI have a capital rubbing and rasping with the flesh-brush--with an extra\r\nscour on the back by Al. J., who is here with us--all inspiriting my\r\ninvalid frame with new life, for the day. Then, after some whiffs\r\nof morning air, the delicious coffee of Mrs. B., with the cream,\r\nstrawberries, and many substantials, for breakfast.\r\n\r\nA SPECIMEN TRAMP FAMILY\r\n\r\n_June 22_.--This afternoon we went out (J. B., Al. and I) on quite a\r\ndrive around the country. The scenery, the perpetual stone fences,\r\n(some venerable old fellows, dark-spotted with lichens)--the many\r\nfine locust-trees--the runs of brawling water, often over descents of\r\nrock--these, and lots else. It is lucky the roads are first-rate here,\r\n(as they are,) for it is up or down hill everywhere, and sometimes steep\r\nenough. B. has a tip-top horse, strong, young, and both gentle and\r\nfast. There is a great deal of waste land and hills on the river edge\r\nof Ulster county, with a wonderful luxuriance of wild flowers and\r\nbushes--and it seems to me I never saw more vitality of trees--eloquent\r\nhemlocks, plenty of locusts and fine maples, and the balm of Gilead,\r\ngiving out aroma. In the fields and along the road-sides unusual crops\r\nof the tall-stemm'd wild daisy, white as milk and yellow as gold.\r\n\r\nWe pass'd quite a number of tramps, singly or in couples--one squad, a\r\nfamily in a rickety one-horse wagon, with some baskets evidently their\r\nwork and trade--the man seated on a low board, in front, driving--the\r\ngauntish woman by his side, with a baby well bundled in her arms, its\r\nlittle red feet and lower legs sticking out right towards us as we\r\npass'd--and in the wagon behind, we saw two (or three) crouching little\r\nchildren. It was a queer, taking, rather sad picture. If I had been\r\nalone and on foot, I should have stopp'd and held confab. But on our\r\nreturn nearly two hours afterward, we found them a ways further along\r\nthe same road, in a lonesome open spot, haul'd aside, unhitch'd, and\r\nevidently going to camp for the night. The freed horse was not far off,\r\nquietly cropping the grass. The man was busy at the wagon, the boy had\r\ngather'd some dry wood, and was making a fire--and as we went a little\r\nfurther we met the woman afoot. I could not see her face, in its\r\ngreat sun-bonnet, but somehow her figure and gait told misery, terror,\r\ndestitution. She had the rag-bundled, half-starv'd infant still in\r\nher arms, and in her hands held two or three baskets, which she had\r\nevidently taken to the next house for sale. A little barefoot five-year\r\nold girl-child, with fine eyes, trotted behind her, clutching her gown.\r\nWe stopp'd, asking about the baskets, which we bought. As we paid the\r\nmoney, she kept her face hidden in the recesses of her bonnet. Then as\r\nwe started, and stopp'd again, Al., (whose sympathies were evidently\r\narous'd,) went back to the camping group to get another basket. He\r\ncaught a look of her face, and talk'd with her a little. Eyes, voice and\r\nmanner were those of a corpse, animated by electricity. She was quite\r\nyoung--the man she was traveling with, middle-aged. Poor woman--what\r\nstory was it, out of her fortunes, to account for that inexpressibly\r\nscared way, those glassy eyes, and that hollow voice?\r\n\r\n\r\nMANHATTAN FROM THE BAY\r\n\r\n_June 25_.--Returned to New York last night. Out to-day on the waters\r\nfor a sail in the wide bay, southeast of Staten island--a rough, tossing\r\nride, and a free sight--the long stretch of Sandy Hook, the highlands\r\nof Navesink, and the many vessels outward and inward bound. We came up\r\nthrough the midst of all, in the full sun. I especially enjoy'd the last\r\nhour or two. A moderate sea-breeze had set in; yet over the city, and\r\nthe waters adjacent, was a thin haze, concealing nothing, only adding to\r\nthe beauty. From my point of view, as I write amid the soft breeze, with\r\na sea-temperature, surely nothing on earth of its kind can go beyond\r\nthis show. To the left the North river with its far vista--nearer, three\r\nor four war-ships, anchor'd peacefully--the Jersey side, the banks of\r\nWeehawken, the Palisades, and the gradually receding blue, lost in the\r\ndistance--to the right the East river--the mast-hemm'd shores--the grand\r\nobelisk-like towers of the bridge, one on either side, in haze,\r\nyet plainly defin'd, giant brothers twain, throwing free graceful\r\ninterlinking loops high across the tumbled tumultuous current\r\nbelow--(the tide is just changing to its ebb)--the broad water-spread\r\neverywhere crowded--no, not crowded, but thick as stars in the sky--with\r\nall sorts and sizes of sail and steam vessels, plying ferry-boats,\r\narriving and departing coasters, great ocean Dons, iron-black, modern,\r\nmagnificent in size and power, fill'd with their incalculable value of\r\nhuman life and precious merchandise--with here and there, above all,\r\nthose daring, careening things of grace and wonder, those white and\r\nshaded swift-darting fish-birds, (I wonder if shore or sea elsewhere\r\ncan outvie them,) ever with their slanting spars, and fierce, pure,\r\nhawk-like beauty and motion--first-class New York sloop or schooner\r\nyachts, sailing, this fine day, the free sea in a good wind. And\r\nrising out of the midst, tall-topt, ship-hemm'd, modern, American,\r\nyet strangely oriental, V-shaped Manhattan, with its compact mass, its\r\nspires, its cloud-touching edifices group'd at the centre--the green of\r\nthe trees, and all the white, brown and gray of the architecture well\r\nblended, as I see it, under a miracle of limpid sky, delicious light of\r\nheaven above, and June haze on the surface below.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMAN AND HEROIC NEW YORK\r\n\r\nThe general subjective view of New York and Brooklyn--(will not the\r\ntime hasten when the two shall be municipally united in one, and named\r\nManhattan?)--what I may call the human interior and exterior of these\r\ngreat seething oceanic populations, as I get it in this visit, is to\r\nme best of all. After an absence of many years, (I went away at the\r\noutbreak of the secession war, and have never been back to stay since,)\r\nagain I resume with curiosity the crowds, the streets, I knew so\r\nwell, Broadway, the ferries, the west side of the city, democratic\r\nBowery--human appearances and manners as seen in all these, and along\r\nthe wharves, and in the perpetual travel of the horse-cars, or the\r\ncrowded excursion steamers, or in Wall and Nassau streets by day--in the\r\nplaces of amusement at night--bubbling and whirling and moving like\r\nits own environment of waters--endless humanity in all phases--Brooklyn\r\nalso--taken in for the last three weeks. No need to specify\r\nminutely--enough to say that (making all allowances for the shadows\r\nand side-streaks of a million-headed-city) the brief total of the\r\nimpressions, the human qualities, of these vast cities, is to me\r\ncomforting, even heroic, beyond statement. Alertness, generally fine\r\nphysique, clear eyes that look straight at you, a singular combination\r\nof reticence and self-possession, with good nature and friendliness--a\r\nprevailing range of according manners, taste and intellect, surely\r\nbeyond any elsewhere upon earth--and a palpable outcropping of that\r\npersonal comradeship I look forward to as the subtlest, strongest future\r\nhold of this many-item'd Union--are not only constantly visible here\r\nin these mighty channels of men, but they form the rule and average.\r\nTo-day, I should say--defiant of cynics and pessimists, and with a full\r\nknowledge of all their exceptions--an appreciative and perceptive study\r\nof the current humanity of New York gives the directest proof yet\r\nof successful Democracy, and of the solution of that paradox, the\r\neligibility of the free and fully developed individual with the\r\nparamount aggregate. In old age, lame and sick, pondering for years on\r\nmany a doubt and danger for this republic of ours--fully aware of all\r\nthat can be said on the other side--I find in this visit to New York,\r\nand the daily contact and rapport with its myriad people, on the scale\r\nof the oceans and tides, the best, most effective medicine my soul has\r\nyet partaken--the grandest physical habitat and surroundings of land and\r\nwater the globe affords--namely, Manhattan island and Brooklyn, which\r\nthe future shall join in one city--city of superb democracy, amid superb\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOURS FOR THE SOUL\r\n\r\n_July 22d, 1878_.--Living down in the country again. A wonderful\r\nconjunction of all that goes to make those sometime miracle-hours after\r\nsunset--so near and yet so far. Perfect, or nearly perfect days, I\r\nnotice, are not so very uncommon; but the combinations that make perfect\r\nnights are few, even in a life time. We have one of those perfections\r\nto-night. Sunset left things pretty clear; the larger stars were visible\r\nsoon as the shades allow'd. A while after 8, three or four great black\r\nclouds suddenly rose, seemingly from different points, and sweeping\r\nwith broad swirls of wind but no thunder, underspread the orbs from\r\nview everywhere, and indicated a violent heatstorm. But without storm,\r\nclouds, blackness and all, sped and vanish'd as suddenly as they had\r\nrisen; and from a little after 9 till 11 the atmosphere and the whole\r\nshow above were in that state of exceptional clearness and glory just\r\nalluded to. In the northwest turned the Great Dipper with its pointers\r\nround the Cynosure. A little south of east the constellation of the\r\nScorpion was fully up, with red Antares glowing in its neck; while\r\ndominating, majestic Jupiter swam, an hour and a half risen, in the\r\neast--(no moon till after 11.) A large part of the sky seem'd just\r\nlaid in great splashes of phosphorus. You could look deeper in, farther\r\nthrough, than usual; the orbs thick as heads of wheat in a field. Not\r\nthat there was any special brilliancy either--nothing near as sharp as\r\nI have seen of keen winter nights, but a curious general luminousness\r\nthroughout to sight, sense, and soul. The latter had much to do with it.\r\n(I am convinced there are hours of Nature, especially of the atmosphere,\r\nmornings and evenings, address'd to the soul. Night transcends, for that\r\npurpose, what the proudest day can do.) Now, indeed, if never before,\r\nthe heavens declared the glory of God. It was to the full sky of the\r\nBible, of Arabia, of the prophets, and of the oldest poems. There,\r\nin abstraction and stillness, (I had gone off by myself to absorb the\r\nscene, to have the spell unbroken,) the copiousness, the removedness,\r\nvitality, loose-clear-crowdedness, of that stellar concave spreading\r\noverhead, softly absorb'd into me, rising so free, interminably high,\r\nstretching east, west, north, south--and I, though but a point in the\r\ncentre below, embodying all.\r\n\r\nAs if for the first time, indeed, creation noiselessly sank into and\r\nthrough me its placid and untellable lesson, beyond--O, so infinitely\r\nbeyond!--anything from art, books, sermons, or from science, old or new.\r\nThe spirit's hour--religion's hour--the visible suggestion of God in\r\nspace and time--now once definitely indicated, if never again. The\r\nuntold pointed at--the heavens all paved with it. The Milky Way, as if\r\nsome superhuman symphony, some ode of universal vagueness, disdaining\r\nsyllable and sound--a flashing glance of Deity, address'd to the soul.\r\nAll silently--the indescribable night and stars--far off and silently.\r\n\r\nTHE DAWN.--_July 23_.--This morning, between one and two hours before\r\nsunrise, a spectacle wrought on the same background, yet of quite\r\ndifferent beauty and meaning. The moon well up in the heavens, and past\r\nher half, is shining brightly--the air and sky of that cynical-clear,\r\nMinerva-like quality, virgin cool--not the weight of sentiment or\r\nmystery, or passion's ecstasy indefinable--not the religious sense,\r\nthe varied All, distill'd and sublimated into one, of the night just\r\ndescribed. Every star now clear-cut, showing for just what it is, there\r\nin the colorless ether. The character of the heralded morning, ineffably\r\nsweet and fresh and limpid, but for the esthetic sense alone, and for\r\npurity without sentiment. I have itemized the night--but dare I attempt\r\nthe cloudless dawn? (What subtle tie is this between one's soul and the\r\nbreak of day? Alike, and yet no two nights or morning shows ever exactly\r\nalike.) Preceded by an immense star, almost unearthly in its effusion\r\nof white splendor, with two or three long unequal spoke-rays of diamond\r\nradiance, shedding down through the fresh morning air below--an hour of\r\nthis, and then the sunrise.\r\n\r\nTHE EAST.--What a subject for a poem! Indeed, where else a more\r\npregnant, more splendid one? Where one more idealistic-real, more\r\nsubtle, more sensuous-delicate? The East, answering all lands, all\r\nages, peoples; touching all senses, here, immediate, now--and yet so\r\nindescribably far off--such retrospect! The East--long-stretching--so\r\nlosing itself--the orient, the gardens of Asia, the womb of history\r\nand song--forth-issuing all those strange, dim cavalcades--Florid\r\nwith blood, pensive, rapt with musings, hot with passion. Sultry with\r\nperfume, with ample and flowing garment. With sunburnt visage, intense\r\nsoul and glittering eyes. Always the East--old, how incalculably old!\r\nAnd yet here the same--ours yet, fresh as a rose, to every morning,\r\nevery life, to-day--and always will be.\r\n\r\n_Sept. 17_. Another presentation--same theme--just before sunrise again,\r\n(a favorite hour with me.) The clear gray sky, a faint glow in the\r\ndull liver-color of the east, the cool fresh odor and the moisture--the\r\ncattle and horses off there grazing in the fields--the star Venus again,\r\ntwo hours high. For sounds, the chirping of crickets in the grass, the\r\nclarion of chanticleer, and the distant cawing of an early crow. Quietly\r\nover the dense fringe of cedars and pines rises that dazzling, red,\r\ntransparent disk of flame, and the low sheets of white vapor roll and\r\nroll into dissolution.\r\n\r\nTHE MOON.--_May 18_.--I went to bed early last night, but found myself\r\nwaked shortly after 12, and, turning awhile, sleepless and mentally\r\nfeverish, I rose, dress'd myself, sallied forth and walk'd down the\r\nlane. The full moon, some three or four hours up--a sprinkle of light\r\nand less-light clouds just lazily moving--Jupiter an hour high in the\r\neast, and here and there throughout the heavens a random star appearing\r\nand disappearing. So beautifully veiled and varied--the air, with that\r\nearly-summer perfume, not at all damp or raw--at times Luna languidly\r\nemerging in richest brightness for minutes, and then partially envelop'd\r\nagain. Far off a poor whip-poor-will plied his notes incessantly. It was\r\nthat silent time between 1 and 3.\r\n\r\nThe rare nocturnal scene, how soon it sooth'd and pacified me! Is there\r\nnot something about the moon, some relation or reminder, which no poem\r\nor literature has yet caught? (In very old and primitive ballads I have\r\ncome across lines or asides that suggest it.) After a while the clouds\r\nmostly clear'd, and as the moon swam on, she carried, shimmering and\r\nshifting, delicate color-effects of pellucid green and tawny vapor. Let\r\nme conclude this part with an extract, (some writer in the \"Tribune,\"\r\nMay 16, 1878):\r\n\r\n  No one ever gets tired of the moon. Goddess that she is by dower of\r\n  her eternal beauty, she is a true woman by her tact--knows the charm\r\n  of being seldom seen, of coming by surprise and staying but a little\r\n  while; never wears the same dress two nights running, nor all night\r\n  the same way; commends herself to the matter-of-fact people by her\r\n  usefulness, and makes her uselessness adored by poets, artists, and\r\n  all lovers in all lands; lends herself to every symbolism and to\r\n  every emblem; is Diana's bow and Venus's mirror and Mary's throne;\r\n  is a sickle, a scarf, an eyebrow, his face or her face, and look'd\r\n  at by her or by him; is the madman's hell, the poet's heaven, the\r\n  baby's toy, the philosopher's study; and while her admirers follow\r\n  her footsteps, and hang on her lovely looks, she knows how to keep\r\n  her woman's secret--her other side--unguess'd and unguessable.\r\n\r\n_Furthermore. February 19, 1880_.--Just before 10 P.M. cold and entirely\r\nclear again, the show overhead, bearing southwest, of wonderful and\r\ncrowded magnificence. The moon in her third quarter--the clusters of\r\nthe Hyades and Pleiades, with the planet Mars between--in full crossing\r\nsprawl in the sky the great Egyptian X, (Sirius, Procyon, and the main\r\nstars in the constellations of the Ship, the Dove, and of Orion;) just\r\nnorth of east Bootes, and in his knee Arcturus, an hour high, mounting\r\nthe heaven, ambitiously large and sparkling, as if he meant to challenge\r\nwith Sirius the stellar supremacy.\r\n\r\nWith the sentiment of the stars and moon such nights I get all the\r\nfree margins and indefiniteness of music or poetry, fused in geometry's\r\nutmost exactness.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRAW-COLOR'D AND OTHER PSYCHES\r\n\r\n_Aug. 4_.--A pretty sight! Where I sit in the shade--a warm day, the sun\r\nshining from cloudless skies, the forenoon well advanc'd--I look over\r\na ten-acre field of luxuriant clover-hay, (the second crop)--the\r\nlivid-ripe red blossoms and dabs of August brown thickly spotting\r\nthe prevailing dark-green. Over all flutter myriads of light-yellow\r\nbutterflies, mostly skimming along the surface, dipping and oscillating,\r\ngiving a curious animation to the scene. The beautiful, spiritual\r\ninsects! straw-color'd Psyches! Occasionally one of them leaves his\r\nmates, and mounts, perhaps spirally, perhaps in a straight line in the\r\nair, fluttering up, up, till literally out of sight. In the lane as I\r\ncame along just now I noticed one spot, ten feet square or so, where\r\nmore than a hundred had collected, holding a revel, a gyration-dance, or\r\nbutterfly good-time, winding and circling, down and across, but always\r\nkeeping within the limits. The little creatures have come out all of a\r\nsudden the last few days, and are now very plentiful. As I sit outdoors,\r\nor walk, I hardly look around without somewhere seeing two (always two)\r\nfluttering through the air in amorous dalliance. Then their inimitable\r\ncolor, their fragility, peculiar motion--and that strange, frequent\r\nway of one leaving the crowd and mounting up, up in the free ether, and\r\napparently never returning. As I look over the field, these yellow-wings\r\neverywhere mildly sparkling, many snowy blossoms of the wild carrot\r\ngracefully bending on their tall and taper stems--while for sounds, the\r\ndistant guttural screech of a flock of guinea-hens comes shrilly yet\r\nsomehow musically to my ears. And now a faint growl of heat-thunder in\r\nthe north--and ever the low rising and falling wind-purr from the tops\r\nof the maples and willows.\r\n\r\n_Aug. 20_.--Butterflies and butterflies, (taking the place of the\r\nbumble-bees of three months since, who have quite disappear'd,) continue\r\nto flit to and fro, all sorts, white, yellow, brown, purple--now and\r\nthen some gorgeous fellow flashing lazily by on wings like artists'\r\npalettes dabb'd with every color. Over the breast of the pond I notice\r\nmany white ones, crossing, pursuing their idle capricious flight. Near\r\nwhere I sit grows a tall-stemm'd weed topt with a profusion of rich\r\nscarlet blossoms, on which the snowy insects alight and dally, sometimes\r\nfour or five of them at a time. By-and-by a humming-bird visits\r\nthe same, and I watch him coming and going, daintily balancing and\r\nshimmering about. These white butterflies give new beautiful contrasts\r\nto the pure greens of the August foliage, (we have had some copious\r\nrains lately,) and over the glistening bronze of the pond-surface. You\r\ncan tame even such insects; I have one big and handsome moth down here,\r\nknows and comes to me, likes me to hold him up on my extended hand.\r\n\r\n_Another Day, later_.--A grand twelve-acre field of ripe cabbages with\r\ntheir prevailing hue of malachite green, and floating-flying over and\r\namong them in all directions myriads of these same white butterflies. As\r\nI came up the lane to-day I saw a living globe of the same, two or three\r\nfeet in diameter, many scores cluster'd together and rolling along\r\nin the air, adhering to their ball-shape, six or eight feet above the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\r\nA NIGHT REMEMBRANCE\r\n\r\n_Aug. 23, 9-10 A.M._--I sit by the pond, everything quiet, the broad\r\npolish'd surface spread before me--the blue of the heavens and the\r\nwhite clouds reflected from it--and flitting across, now and then, the\r\nreflection of some flying bird. Last night I was down here with a friend\r\ntill after midnight; everything a miracle of splendor--the glory of the\r\nstars, and the completely rounded moon--the passing clouds, silver and\r\nluminous-tawny--now and then masses of vapory illuminated scud--and\r\nsilently by my side my dear friend. The shades of the trees, and patches\r\nof moonlight on the grass--the softly blowing breeze, and just-palpable\r\nodor of the neighboring ripening corn--the indolent and spiritual night,\r\ninexpressibly rich, tender, suggestive--something altogether to filter\r\nthrough one's soul, and nourish and feed and soothe the memory long\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD FLOWERS\r\n\r\nThis has been and is yet a great season for wild flowers; oceans of them\r\nline the roads through the woods, border the edges of the water-runlets,\r\ngrow all along the old fences, and are scatter'd in profusion over the\r\nfields. An eight-petal'd blossom of gold-yellow, clear and bright, with\r\na brown tuft in the middle, nearly as large as a silver half-dollar, is\r\nvery common; yesterday on a long drive I noticed it thickly lining the\r\nborders of the brooks everywhere. Then there is a beautiful weed cover'd\r\nwith blue flowers, (the blue of the old Chinese teacups treasur'd by our\r\ngrand-aunts,) I am continually stopping to admire--a little larger than\r\na dime, and very plentiful. White, however, is the prevailing color. The\r\nwild carrot I have spoken of; also the fragrant life-everlasting. But\r\nthere are all hues and beauties, especially on the frequent tracts of\r\nhalf-opened scrub-oak and dwarf cedar hereabout--wild asters of all\r\ncolors. Notwithstanding the frost-touch the hardy little chaps maintain\r\nthemselves in all their bloom. The tree-leaves, too, some of them are\r\nbeginning to turn yellow or drab or dull green. The deep wine-color of\r\nthe sumachs and gum-treesis already visible, and the straw-color of the\r\ndog-wood and beech. Let me give the names of some of these perennial\r\nblossoms and friendly weeds I have made acquaintance with hereabout one\r\nseason or another in my walks:\r\n\r\nWild azalea, dandelions wild honeysuckle, yarrow, wild roses, coreopsis,\r\ngolden rod, wild pea, larkspur, woodbine, early crocus, elderberry,\r\nsweet flag, (great patches of it,) poke-weed, creeper, trumpet-flower,\r\nsun-flower, scented marjoram, chamomile, snakeroot, violets, Solomon's\r\nseal, clematis, sweet balm, bloodroot mint, (great plenty,) swamp\r\nmagnolia, wild geranium, milk-weed, wild heliotrope, wild daisy,\r\n(plenty,) burdock, wild chrysanthemum.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CIVILITY TOO LONG NEGLECTED\r\n\r\nThe foregoing reminds me of something.\r\n\r\nAs the individualities I would mainly portray have certainly been\r\nslighted by folks who make pictures, volumes, poems, out of them--as\r\na faint testimonial of my own gratitude for many hours of peace and\r\ncomfort in half-sickness, (and not by any means sure but they will\r\nsomehow get wind of the compliment,) I hereby dedicate the last half of\r\nthese Specimen Days to the\r\n\r\n  bees,                                     glow-worms, (swarming millions\r\n  black-birds,                                of them indescribably\r\n  dragon-flies,                               strange and beautiful at night\r\n  pond-turtles,                               over the pond and creek,)\r\n  mulleins, tansy, peppermint,              water-snakes,\r\n  moths, (great and little, some            crows,\r\n          splendid fellows,)                millers,\r\n  mosquitoes,                               cedars,\r\n  butterflies,                              tulip-trees, (and all other trees,)\r\n  wasps and hornets,                          and to the spots and memories\r\n  cat-birds, (and all other birds,)           of those days, and the creek.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELAWARE RIVER--DAYS AND NIGHTS\r\n\r\n_April 5, 1879_.-With the return of spring to the skies, airs, waters of\r\nthe Delaware, return the sea-gulls. I never tire of watching their broad\r\nand easy flight, in spirals, or as they oscillate with slow unflapping\r\nwings, or look down with curved beak, or dipping to the water after\r\nfood. The crows, plenty enough all through the winter, have vanish'd\r\nwith the ice. Not one of them now to be seen. The steamboats have again\r\ncome forth--bustling up, handsome, freshly painted, for summer work--the\r\nColumbia, the Edwin Forrest, (the Republic not yet out,) the Reybold,\r\nNelly White, the Twilight, the Ariel, the Warner, the Perry, the\r\nTaggart, the Jersey Blue--even the hulky old Trenton--not forgetting\r\nthose saucy little bull-pups of the current, the steamtugs.\r\n\r\nBut let me bunch and catalogue the affair--the river itself, all the\r\nway from the sea--Cape island on one side and Henlopen light on the\r\nother--up the broad bay north, and so to Philadelphia, and on further to\r\nTrenton;--the sights I am most familiar with, (as I live a good part\r\nof the time in Camden, I view matters from that outlook)--the great\r\narrogant, black, full-freighted ocean steamers, inward or outward\r\nbound--the ample width here between the two cities, intersected by\r\nWindmill island--an occasional man-of-war, sometimes a foreigner, at\r\nanchor, with her guns and port-holes, and the boats, and the brown-faced\r\nsailors, and the regular oar-strokes, and the gay crowds of \"visiting\r\nday\"--the frequent large and handsome three-masted schooners, (a\r\nfavorite style of marine build, hereabout of late years,) some of\r\nthem new and very jaunty, with their white-gray sails and yellow pine\r\nspars--the sloops dashing along in a fair wind--(I see one now, coming\r\nup, under broad canvas, her gaff-topsail shining in the sun, high and\r\npicturesque--what a thing of beauty amid the sky and waters!)--the\r\ncrowded wharf-slips along the city--the flags of different\r\nnationalities, the sturdy English cross on its ground of blood, the\r\nFrench tricolor, the banner of the great North German empire, and the\r\nItalian and the Spanish colors--sometimes, of an afternoon, the whole\r\nscene enliven'd by a fleet of yachts, in a half calm, lazily returning\r\nfrom a race down at Gloucester;--the neat, rakish, revenue steamer\r\n\"Hamilton\" in mid-stream, with her perpendicular stripes flaunting\r\naft--and, turning the eyes north, the long ribands of fleecy-white\r\nsteam, or dingy-black smoke, stretching far, fan-shaped, slanting\r\ndiagonally across from the Kensington or Richmond shores, in the\r\nwest-by-south-west wind.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENES ON FERRY AND RIVER--LAST WINTER'S NIGHTS\r\n\r\nThen the Camden ferry. What exhilaration, change, people, business, by\r\nday. What soothing, silent, wondrous hours, at night, crossing on the\r\nboat, most all to myself--pacing the deck, alone, forward or aft. What\r\ncommunion with the waters, the air, the exquisite _chiaroscuro_--the\r\nsky and stars, that speak no word, nothing to the intellect, yet so\r\neloquent, so communicative to the soul. And the ferry men--little they\r\nknow how much they have been to me, day and night--how many spells of\r\nlistlessness, ennui, debility, they and their hardy ways have dispell'd.\r\nAnd the pilots--captains Hand, Walton, and Giberson by day, and captain\r\nOlive at night; Eugene Crosby, with his strong young arm so often\r\nsupporting, circling, convoying me over the gaps of the bridge, through\r\nimpediments, safely aboard. Indeed all my ferry friends--captain Frazee\r\nthe superintendent, Lindell, Hiskey, Fred Rauch, Price, Watson, and\r\na dozen more. And the ferry itself, with its queer scenes--sometimes\r\nchildren suddenly born in the waiting-houses (an actual fact--and more\r\nthan once)--sometimes a masquerade party, going over at night, with a\r\nband of music, dancing and whirling like mad on the broad deck, in their\r\nfantastic dresses; sometimes the astronomer, Mr. Whitall, (who posts\r\nme up in points about the stars by a living lesson there and then, and\r\nanswering every question)--sometimes a prolific family group, eight,\r\nnine, ten, even twelve! (Yesterday, as I cross'd, a mother, father, and\r\neight children, waiting in the ferry-house, bound westward somewhere.)\r\n\r\nI have mention'd the crows. I always watch them from the boats. They\r\nplay quite a part in the winter scenes on the river, by day. Their black\r\nsplatches are seen in relief against the snow and ice everywhere at that\r\nseason--sometimes flying and flapping--sometimes on little or larger\r\ncakes, sailing up or down the stream. One day the river was mostly\r\nclear--only a single long ridge of broken ice making a narrow stripe by\r\nitself, running along down the current for over a mile, quite rapidly.\r\nOn this white stripe the crows were congregated, hundreds of them--a\r\nfunny procession--(\"half mourning\" was the comment of some one.)\r\n\r\nThen the reception room, for passengers waiting--life illustrated\r\nthoroughly. Take a March picture I jotted there two or three weeks\r\nsince. Afternoon, about 3-1/2 o'clock, it begins to snow. There has been\r\na matinee performance at the theater--from 4-1/2 to 5 comes a stream\r\nof homeward bound ladies. I never knew the spacious room to present a\r\ngayer, more lively scene--handsome, well-drest Jersey women and girls,\r\nscores of them, streaming in for nearly an hour--the bright eyes and\r\nglowing faces, coming in from the air--a sprinkling of snow on bonnets\r\nor dresses as they enter--the five or ten minutes' waiting--the chatting\r\nand laughing--(women can have capital times among themselves, with\r\nplenty of wit, lunches, jovial abandon)--Lizzie, the pleasant-manner'd\r\nwaiting-room woman--for sound, the bell-taps and steam-signals of the\r\ndeparting boats with their rhythmic break and undertone--the\r\ndomestic pictures, mothers with bevies of daughters, (a charming\r\nsight)--children, countrymen--the railroad men in their blue clothes\r\nand caps--all the various characters of city and country represented\r\nor suggested. Then outside some belated passenger frantically running,\r\njumping after the boat. Towards six o' clock the human stream\r\ngradually thickening--now a pressure of vehicles, drays, piled railroad\r\ncrates--now a drove of cattle, making quite an excitement, the drovers\r\nwith heavy sticks, belaboring the steaming sides of the frighten'd\r\nbrutes. Inside the reception room, business bargains, flirting,\r\nlove-making, _eclaircissements_, proposals--pleasant, sober-faced Phil\r\ncoming in with his burden of afternoon papers--or Jo, or Charley (who\r\njump'd in the dock last week, and saved a stout lady from drowning,) to\r\nreplenish the stove, and clearing it with long crow-bar poker.\r\n\r\nBesides all this \"comedy human,\" the river affords nutriment of a\r\nhigher order. Here are some of my memoranda of the past winter, just as\r\npencill'd down on the spot.\r\n\r\n_A January Night_.--Fine trips across the wide Delaware to-night. Tide\r\npretty high, and a strong ebb. River, a little after 8, full of ice,\r\nmostly broken, but some large cakes making our strong-timber'd steamboat\r\nhum and quiver as she strikes them. In the clear moonlight they spread,\r\nstrange, unearthly, silvery, faintly glistening, as far as I can see.\r\nBumping, trembling, sometimes hissing like a thousand snakes, the\r\ntide-procession, as we wend with or through it, affording a grand\r\nundertone, in keeping with the scene. Overhead, the splendor\r\nindescribable; yet something haughty, almost supercilious, in the night.\r\nNever did I realize more latent sentiment, almost _passion_, in those\r\nsilent interminable stars up there. One can understand, such a night,\r\nwhy, from the days of the Pharaohs or Job, the dome of heaven, sprinkled\r\nwith planets, has supplied the subtlest, deepest criticism on human\r\npride, glory, ambition.\r\n\r\n_Another Winter Night_.--I don't know anything more _filling_ than to be\r\non the wide firm deck of a powerful boat, a clear, cool, extra-moonlight\r\nnight, crushing proudly and resistlessly through this thick, marbly,\r\nglistening ice. The whole river is now spread with it--some immense\r\ncakes. There is such weirdness about the scene--partly the quality of\r\nthe light, with its tinge of blue, the lunar twilight--only the large\r\nstars holding their own in the radiance of the moon. Temperature sharp,\r\ncomfortable for motion, dry, full of oxygen. But the sense of power--the\r\nsteady, scornful, imperious urge of our strong new engine, as she\r\nploughs her way through the big and little cakes.\r\n\r\n_Another_.--For two hours I cross'd and recross'd, merely for\r\npleasure--for a still excitement. Both sky and river went through\r\nseveral changes. The first for awhile held two vast fan-shaped echelons\r\nof light clouds, through which the moon waded, now radiating, carrying\r\nwith her an aureole of tawny transparent brown, and now flooding the\r\nwhole vast with clear vapory light-green, through which, as through an\r\nilluminated veil, she moved with measur'd womanly motion. Then, another\r\ntrip, the heavens would be absolutely clear, and Luna in all her\r\neffulgence. The big Dipper in the north, with the double star in the\r\nhandle much plainer than common. Then the sheeny track of light in the\r\nwater, dancing and rippling. Such transformations; such pictures and\r\npoems, inimitable.\r\n\r\n_Another_.--I am studying the stars, under advantages, as I cross\r\ntonight. (It is late in February, and again extra clear.) High toward\r\nthe west, the Pleiades, tremulous with delicate sparkle, in the soft\r\nheavens,--Aldebaran, leading the V-shaped Hyades--and overhead Capella\r\nand her kids. Most majestic of all, in full display in the high south,\r\nOrion, vast-spread, roomy, chief historian of the stage, with his shiny\r\nyellow rosette on his shoulder, and his three kings--and a little to\r\nthe east, Sirius, calmly arrogant, most wondrous single star. Going late\r\nashore, (I couldn't give up the beauty, and soothingness of the night,)\r\nas I staid around, or slowly wander'd I heard the echoing calls of\r\nthe railroad men in the West Jersey depot yard, shifting and switching\r\ntrains, engines, etc.; amid the general silence otherways, and something\r\nin the acoustic quality of the air, musical, emotional effects, never\r\nthought of before. I linger'd long and long, listening to them.\r\n\r\n_Night of March 18, '79_.--One of the calm, pleasantly cool, exquisitely\r\nclear and cloudless, early spring nights--the atmosphere again that rare\r\nvitreous blue-black, welcom'd by astronomers. Just at 8, evening, the\r\nscene overhead of certainly solemnest beauty, never surpass'd. Venus\r\nnearly down in the west, of a size and lustre as if trying to outshow\r\nherself, before departing. Teeming, maternal orb--I take you again to\r\nmyself. I am reminded of that spring preceding Abraham Lincoln's murder,\r\nwhen I, restlessly haunting the Potomac banks, around Washington city,\r\nwatch'd you, off there, aloof, moody as myself:\r\n\r\n    As we walk'd up and down in the dark blue so mystic,\r\n    As we walk'd in silence the transparent shadowy night,\r\n    As I saw you had something to tell, as you bent to me night after\r\n      night,\r\n    As you droop from the sky low down, as if to my side, (while the\r\n      other stars all look'd on,)\r\n    As we wander'd together the solemn night.\r\n\r\nWith departing Venus, large to the last, and shining even to the edge\r\nof the horizon, the vast dome presents at this moment, such a spectacle!\r\nMercury was visible just after sunset--a rare sight. Arcturus is now\r\nrisen, just north of east. In calm glory all the stars of Orion hold the\r\nplace of honor, in meridian, to the south,--with the Dog-star a little\r\nto the left. And now, just rising, Spica, late, low, and slightly\r\nveil'd. Castor, Regulus and the rest, all shining unusually clear, (no\r\nMars or Jupiter or moon till morning.) On the edge of the river, many\r\nlamps twinkling--with two or three huge chimneys, a couple of miles up,\r\nbelching forth molten, steady flames, volcano-like, illuminating all\r\naround--and sometimes an electric or calcium, its Dante-Inferno\r\ngleams, in far shafts, terrible, ghastly-powerful. Of later May nights,\r\ncrossing, I like to watch the fishermen's little buoy-lights--so pretty,\r\nso dreamy--like corpse candles--undulating delicate and lonesome on the\r\nsurface of the shadowy waters, floating with the current.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST SPRING DAY ON CHESTNUT STREET\r\n\r\nWinter relaxing its hold, has already allow'd us a foretaste of spring.\r\nAs I write, yesterday afternoon's softness and brightness, (after\r\nthe morning fog, which gave it a better setting, by contrast,) show'd\r\nChestnut street--say between Broad and Fourth--to more advantage in its\r\nvarious asides, and all its stores, and gay-dress'd crowds generally,\r\nthan for three months past. I took a walk there between one and two.\r\nDoubtless, there were plenty of hard-up folks along the pavements, but\r\nnine-tenths of the myriad-moving human panorama to all appearance seem'd\r\nflush, well-fed, and fully-provided. At all events it was good\r\nto be on Chestnut street yesterday. The peddlers on the\r\nsidewalk--(\"sleeve-buttons, three for five cents\")--the handsome little\r\nfellow with canary-bird whistles--the cane men, toy men, toothpick\r\nmen--the old woman squatted in a heap on the cold stone flags, with\r\nher basket of matches, pins and tape--the young negro mother, sitting,\r\nbegging, with her two little coffee-color'd twins on her lap--the beauty\r\nof the cramm'd conservatory of rare flowers, flaunting reds, yellows,\r\nsnowy lilies, incredible orchids, at the Baldwin mansion near Twelfth\r\nstreet--the show of fine poultry, beef, fish, at the restaurants--the\r\nchina stores, with glass and statuettes--the luscious tropical\r\nfruits--the street cars plodding along, with their tintinnabulating\r\nbells--the fat, cab-looking, rapidly driven one-horse vehicles of\r\nthe post-office, squeez'd full of coming or going letter-carriers, so\r\nhealthy and handsome and manly-looking, in their gray uniforms--the\r\ncostly books, pictures, curiosities, in the windows--the gigantic\r\npolicemen at most of the corners will all be readily remember'd and\r\nrecognized as features of this principal avenue of Philadelphia.\r\nChestnut street, I have discover'd, is not without individuality, and\r\nits own points, even when compared with the great promenade-streets of\r\nother cities. I have never been in Europe, but acquired years' familiar\r\nexperience with New York's, (perhaps the world's) great thoroughfare,\r\nBroadway, and possess to some extent a personal and saunterer's\r\nknowledge of St. Charles street in New Orleans, Tremont street in\r\nBoston, and the broad trottoirs of Pennsylvania avenue in Washington. Of\r\ncourse it is a pity that Chestnut were not two or three times wider; but\r\nthe street, any fine day, shows vividness, motion, variety, not easily\r\nto be surpass'd. (Sparkling eyes, human faces, magnetism, well-dress'd\r\nwomen, ambulating to and fro--with lots o fine things in the\r\nwindows--are they not about the same, the civilized world over?)\r\n\r\n    How fast the flitting figures come!\r\n        The mild, the fierce, the stony face;\r\n    Some bright with thoughtless smiles--and some\r\n        Where secret tears have left their trace.\r\n\r\nA few days ago one of the six-story clothing stores along here had\r\nthe space inside its plate-glass show-window partition'd into a little\r\ncorral, and litter'd deeply with rich clover and hay, (I could smell the\r\nodor outside,) on which reposed two magnificent fat sheep, full-sized\r\nbut young--the handsomest creatures of the kind I ever saw. I stop's\r\nlong and long, with the crowd, to view them--one lying down chewing the\r\ncud, and one standing up, looking out, with dense-fringed patient\r\neyes. Their wool, of a clear tawny color, with streaks of glistening\r\nblack--altogether a queer sight amidst that crowded promenade of\r\ndandies, dollars and dry-goods.\r\n\r\n\r\nUP THE HUDSON TO ULSTER COUNTY\r\n\r\n_April 23._--Off to New York on a little tour and visit. Leaving the\r\nhospitable, home-like quarters of my valued friends, Mr. and Mrs. J. H.\r\nJohnston--took the 4 P. M. boat, bound up the Hudson, 100 miles or so.\r\nSunset and evening fine. Especially enjoy'd the hour after we passed\r\nCozzens's landing--the night lit by the crescent moon and Venus, now\r\nswimming in tender glory, and now hid by the high rocks and hills of the\r\nwestern shore, which we hugg'd close. (Where I spend the next ten days\r\nis in Ulster county and its neighborhood, with frequent morning and\r\nevening drives, observations of the river, and short rambles.)\r\n\r\n_April 24--Noon._--A little more and the sun would be oppressive. The\r\nbees are out gathering their bread from willows and other trees. I watch\r\nthem returning, darting through the air or lighting on the hives, their\r\nthighs covered with the yellow forage. A solitary robin sings near. I\r\nsit in my shirt sleeves and gaze from an open bay-window on the indolent\r\nscene--the thin haze, the Fishkill hills in the distance--off on\r\nthe river, a sloop with slanting mainsail, and two or three little\r\nshad-boats. Over on the railroad opposite, long freight trains,\r\nsometimes weighted by cylinder-tanks of petroleum, thirty, forty, fifty\r\ncars in a string, panting and rumbling along in full view, but the sound\r\nsoften'd by distance.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAYS AT J. B.'S TURF-FIRES--SPRING SONGS\r\n\r\n_April 26_.--At sunrise, the pure clear sound of the meadow lark. An\r\nhour later, some notes, few and simple, yet delicious and perfect, from\r\nthe bush-sparrow-towards noon the reedy trill of the robin. To-day is\r\nthe fairest, sweetest yet--penetrating warmth--a lovely veil in the air,\r\npartly heat-vapor and partly from the turf-fires everywhere in patches\r\non the farms. A group of soft maples near by silently bursts out in\r\ncrimson tips, buzzing all day with busy bees. The white sails of sloops\r\nand schooners glide up and down the river; and long trains of cars, with\r\nponderous roll, or faint bell notes, almost constantly on the opposite\r\nshore. The earliest wild flowers in the woods and fields, spicy arbutus,\r\nblue liverwort, frail anemone, and the pretty white blossoms of the\r\nbloodroot. I launch out in slow rambles, discovering them. As I go along\r\nthe roads I like to see the farmers' fires in patches, burning the dry\r\nbrush, turf, debris. How the smoke crawls along, flat to the ground,\r\nslanting, slowly rising, reaching away, and at last dissipating. I like\r\nits acrid smell--whiffs just reaching me--welcomer than French perfume.\r\n\r\nThe birds are plenty; of any sort, or of two or three sorts, curiously,\r\nnot a sign, till suddenly some warm, gushing, sunny April (or even\r\nMarch) day--lo! there they are, from twig to twig, or fence to fence,\r\nflirting, singing, some mating, preparing to build. But most of them _en\r\npassant_--a fortnight, a month in these parts, and then away. As in all\r\nphases, Nature keeps up her vital, copious, eternal procession. Still,\r\nplenty of the birds hang around all or most of the season--now their\r\nlove-time, and era of nest-building. I find flying over the river,\r\ncrows, gulls and hawks. I hear the afternoon shriek of the latter,\r\ndarting about, preparing to nest. The oriole will soon be heard here,\r\nand the twanging _meoeow_ of the cat-bird; also the king-bird, cuckoo\r\nand the warblers. All along, there are three peculiarly characteristic\r\nspring songs--the meadow-lark's, so sweet, so alert and remonstrating\r\n(as if he said, \"don't you see?\" or, \"can't you understand?\")--the\r\ncheery, mellow, human tones of the robin--(I have been trying for years\r\nto get a brief term, or phrase, that would identify and describe that\r\nrobin call)--and the amorous whistle of the high-hole. Insects are out\r\nplentifully at midday.\r\n\r\n_April 29_.--As we drove lingering along the road we heard, just after\r\nsundown, the song of the wood-thrush. We stopp'd without a word, and\r\nlisten'd long. The delicious notes--a sweet, artless, voluntary, simple\r\nanthem, as from the flute-stops of some organ, wafted through the\r\ntwilight--echoing well to us from the perpendicular high rock, where, in\r\nsome thick young trees' recesses at the base, sat the bird--fill'd our\r\nsenses, our souls.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEETING A HERMIT\r\n\r\nI found in one of my rambles up the hills a real hermit, living in a\r\nlonesome spot, hard to get at, rocky, the view fine, with a little patch\r\nof land two rods square. A man of youngish middle age, city born and\r\nraised, had been to school, had travel'd in Europe and California. I\r\nfirst met him once or twice on the road, and pass'd the time of day,\r\nwith some small talk; then, the third time, he ask'd me to go along a\r\nbit and rest in his hut (an almost unprecedented compliment, as I heard\r\nfrom others afterwards.) He was of Quaker stock, I think; talk'd with\r\nease and moderate freedom, but did not unbosom his life, or story, or\r\ntragedy, or whatever it was.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ULSTER COUNTY WATERFALL\r\n\r\nI jot this mem, in a wild scene of woods and hills, where we have come\r\nto visit a waterfall. I never saw finer or more copious hemlocks, many\r\nof them large, some old and hoary. Such a sentiment to them, secretive,\r\nshaggy--what I call weather-beaten and let-alone--a rich underlay of\r\nferns, yew sprouts and mosses, beginning to be spotted with the early\r\nsummer wild-flowers. Enveloping all, the monotone and liquid gurgle\r\nfrom the hoarse impetuous copious fall--the greenish-tawny, darkly\r\ntransparent waters, plunging with velocity down the rocks, with patches\r\nof milk-white foam--a stream of hurrying amber, thirty feet wide, risen\r\nfar back in the hills and woods, now rushing with volume--every hundred\r\nrods a fall, and sometimes three or four in that distance. A primitive\r\nforest, druidical, solitary and savage--not ten visitors a year--broken\r\nrocks everywhere--shade overhead, thick underfoot with leaves--a just\r\npalpable wild and delicate aroma.\r\n\r\n\r\nWALTER DUMONT AND HIS MEDAL\r\n\r\nAs I saunter'd along the high road yesterday, I stopp'd to watch a man\r\nnear by, ploughing a rough stony field with a yoke of oxen. Usually\r\nthere is much geeing and hawing, excitement, and continual noise and\r\nexpletives, about a job of this kind. But I noticed how different,\r\nhow easy and wordless, yet firm and sufficient, the work of this young\r\nploughman. His name was Walter Dumont, a farmer, and son of a farmer,\r\nworking for their living. Three years ago, when the steamer \"Sunnyside\"\r\nwas wreck'd of a bitter icy night on the west bank here, Walter went\r\nout in his boat--was the first man on hand with assistance--made a\r\nway through the ice to shore, connected a line, perform'd work of\r\nfirst-class readiness, daring, danger, and saved numerous lives. Some\r\nweeks after, one evening when he was up at Esopus, among the usual\r\nloafing crowd at the country store and post-office, there arrived\r\nthe gift of an unexpected official gold medal for the quiet hero. The\r\nimpromptu presentation was made to him on the spot, but he blush'd,\r\nhesitated as he took it, and had nothing to say.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUDSON RIVER SIGHTS\r\n\r\nIt was a happy thought to build the Hudson river railroad right\r\nalong the shore. The grade is already made by nature; you are sure of\r\nventilation one side--and you are in nobody's way. I see, hear, the\r\nlocomotives and cars, rumbling, roaring, flaming, smoking, constantly,\r\naway off there, night and day--less than a mile distant, and in full\r\nview by day. I like both sight and sound. Express trains thunder and\r\nlighten along; of freight trains, most of them very long, there cannot\r\nbe less than a hundred a day. At night far down you see the headlight\r\napproaching, coming steadily on like a meteor. The river at night has\r\nits special character-beauties. The shad fishermen go forth in their\r\nboats and pay out their nets--one sitting forward, rowing, and one\r\nstanding up aft dropping it properly-marking the line with little\r\nfloats bearing candles, conveying, as they glide over the water, an\r\nindescribable sentiment and doubled brightness. I like to watch the tows\r\nat night, too, with their twinkling lamps, and hear the husky panting\r\nof the steamers; or catch the sloops' and schooners' shadowy forms, like\r\nphantoms, white, silent, indefinite, out there. Then the Hudson of a\r\nclear moonlight night.\r\n\r\nBut there is one sight the very grandest. Sometimes in the fiercest\r\ndriving storm of wind, rain, hail or snow, a great eagle will appear\r\nover the river, now soaring with steady and now overbended wings--always\r\nconfronting the gale, or perhaps cleaving into, or at times literally\r\n_sitting_ upon it. It is like reading some first-class natural tragedy\r\nor epic, or hearing martial trumpets. The splendid bird enjoys the\r\nhubbub--is adjusted and equal to it--finishes it so artistically.\r\nHis pinions just oscillating--the position of his head and neck--his\r\nresistless, occasionally varied flight--now a swirl, now an upward\r\nmovement--the black clouds driving--the angry wash below--the hiss\r\nof rain, the wind's piping (perhaps the ice colliding, grunting)--he\r\ntacking or jibing--now, as it were, for a change, abandoning himself to\r\nthe gale, moving with it with such velocity--and now, resuming control,\r\nhe comes up against it, lord of the situation and the storm--lord, amid\r\nit, of power and savage joy.\r\n\r\nSometimes (as at present writing,) middle of sunny afternoon, the\r\nold \"Vanderbilt\" steamer stalking ahead--I plainly hear her rhythmic,\r\nslushing paddles--drawing by long hawsers an immense and varied\r\nfollowing string, (\"an old sow and pigs,\" the river folks call it.)\r\nFirst comes a big barge, with a house built on it, and spars towering\r\nover the roof; then canal boats, a lengthen'd, clustering train,\r\nfasten'd and link'd together--the one in the middle, with high staff,\r\nflaunting a broad and gaudy flag--others with the almost invariable\r\nlines of new-wash'd clothes, drying; two sloops and a schooner aside the\r\ntow--little wind, and that adverse--with three long, dark, empty barges\r\nbringing up the rear. People are on the boats: men lounging, women in\r\nsun-bonnets, children, stovepipes with streaming smoke.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO CITY AREAS, CERTAIN HOURS\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, _May 24, '79_.--Perhaps no quarters of this city (I have\r\nreturn'd again for awhile,) make more brilliant, animated, crowded,\r\nspectacular human presentations these fine May afternoons than the two\r\nI am now going to describe from personal observation. First: that\r\narea comprising Fourteenth street (especially the short range between\r\nBroadway and Fifth avenue) with Union square, its adjacencies, and so\r\nretrostretching down Broadway for half a mile. All the walks here are\r\nwide, and the spaces ample and free--now flooded with liquid gold from\r\nthe last two hours of powerful sunshine. The whole area at 5 o'clock,\r\nthe days of my observations, must have contain'd from thirty to\r\nforty thousand finely-dress'd people, all in motion, plenty of them\r\ngood-looking, many beautiful women, often youths and children,\r\nthe latter in groups with their nurses--the trottoirs everywhere\r\nclose-spread, thick-tangled, (yet no collision, no trouble,) with masses\r\nof bright color, action, and tasty toilets; (surely the women dress\r\nbetter than ever before, and the men do too.) As if New York would show\r\nthese afternoons what it can do in its humanity, its choicest physique\r\nand physiognomy, and its countless prodigality of locomotion, dry goods,\r\nglitter, magnetism, and happiness.\r\n\r\nSecond: also from 5 to 7 P.M. the stretch of Fifth avenue, all the way\r\nfrom the Central Park exits at Fifty-ninth street, down to Fourteenth,\r\nespecially along the high grade by Fortieth street, and down the hill.\r\nA Mississippi of horses and rich vehicles, not by dozens and scores, but\r\nhundreds and thousands--the broad avenue filled and cramm'd with them--a\r\nmoving, sparkling, hurrying crush, for more than two miles. (I wonder\r\nthey don't get block'd, but I believe they never do.) Altogether it is\r\nto me the marvel sight of New York. I like to get in one of the Fifth\r\navenue stages and ride up, stemming the swift-moving procession. I doubt\r\nif London or Paris or any city in the world can show such a carriage\r\ncarnival as I have seen here five or six times these beautiful May\r\nafternoons.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRAL PARK WALKS AND TALKS\r\n\r\n_May 16 to 22_.--I visit Central Park now almost every day, sitting,\r\nor slowly rambling, or riding around. The whole place presents its very\r\nbest appearance this current month--the full flush of the trees, the\r\nplentiful white and pink of the flowering shrubs, the emerald green of\r\nthe grass spreading everywhere, yellow dotted still with dandelions--the\r\nspecialty of the plentiful gray rocks, peculiar to these grounds,\r\ncropping out, miles and miles--and over all the beauty and purity,\r\nthree days out of four, of our summer skies. As I sit, placidly,\r\nearly afternoon, off against Ninetieth street, the policeman, C. C., a\r\nwell-form'd sandy-complexion'd young fellow, comes over and stands near\r\nme. We grow quite friendly and chatty forth-with. He is a New Yorker\r\nborn and raised, and in answer to my questions tells me about the life\r\nof a New York Park policeman, (while he talks keeping his eyes and ears\r\nvigilantly open, occasionally pausing and moving where he can get full\r\nviews of the vistas of the road, up and down, and the spaces around.)\r\nThe pay is $2.40 a day (seven days to a week)--the men come on and work\r\neight hours straight ahead, which is all that is required of them out of\r\nthe twenty-four. The position has more risks than one might suppose--for\r\ninstance if a team or horse runs away (which happens daily) each man is\r\nexpected not only to be prompt, but to waive safety and stop wildest nag\r\nor nags--(_do it_, and don't be thinking of your bones or face)--give\r\nthe alarm-whistle too, so that other guards may repeat, and the vehicles\r\nup and down the tracks be warn'd. Injuries to the men are continually\r\nhappening. There is much alertness and quiet strength. (Few appreciate,\r\nI have often thought, the Ulyssean capacity, derring do, quick readiness\r\nin emergencies, practicality, unwitting devotion and heroism, among\r\nour American young men and working-people--the firemen, the railroad\r\nemployes, the steamer and ferry men, the police, the conductors and\r\ndrivers--the whole splendid average of native stock, city and country.)\r\nIt is good work, though; and upon the whole, the Park force members like\r\nit. They see life, and the excitement keeps them up. There is not so\r\nmuch difficulty as might be supposed from tramps, roughs, or in keeping\r\npeople \"off the grass.\" The worst trouble of the regular Park employé is\r\nfrom malarial fever, chills, and the like.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FINE AFTERNOON, 4 TO 6\r\n\r\nTen thousand vehicles careering through the Park this perfect afternoon.\r\nSuch a show! and I have seen all--watch'd it narrowly, and at\r\nmy leisure. Private barouches, cabs and coupés, some fine\r\nhorseflesh--lapdogs, footmen, fashions, foreigners, cockades on hats,\r\ncrests on panels--the full oceanic tide of New York's wealth and\r\n\"gentility.\" It was an impressive, rich, interminable circus on a grand\r\nscale, full of action and color in the beauty of the day, under\r\nthe clear sun and moderate breeze. Family groups, couples, single\r\ndrivers--of course dresses generally elegant--much \"style,\" (yet perhaps\r\nlittle or nothing, even in that direction, that fully justified itself.)\r\nThrough the windows of two or three of the richest carriages I saw\r\nfaces almost corpse-like, so ashy and listless. Indeed the whole affair\r\nexhibited less of sterling America, either in spirit or countenance,\r\nthan I had counted on from such a select mass-spectacle. I suppose, as\r\na proof of limitless wealth, leisure, and the aforesaid \"gentility,\" it\r\nwas tremendous. Yet what I saw those hours (I took two other occasions,\r\ntwo other afternoons to watch the same scene,) confirms a thought that\r\nhaunts me every additional glimpse I get of our top-loftical general or\r\nrather exceptional phases of wealth and fashion in this country--namely,\r\nthat they are ill at ease, much too conscious, cased in too many\r\ncerements, and far from happy--that there is nothing in them which\r\nwe who are poor and plain need at all envy, and that instead of the\r\nperennial smell of the grass and woods and shores, their typical\r\nredolence is of soaps and essences, very rare may be, but suggesting the\r\nbarber shop--something that turns stale and musty in a few hours anyhow.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the show on the horseback road was prettiest. Many groups\r\n(threes a favorite number,) some couples, some singly--many\r\nladies--frequently horses or parties dashing along on a full run--fine\r\nriding the rule--a few really first-class animals. As the afternoon\r\nwaned, the wheel'd carriages grew less, but the saddle-riders seemed to\r\nincrease. They linger'd long--and I saw some charming forms and faces.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPARTING OF THE BIG STEAMERS\r\n\r\n_May 25._--A three hours' bay-trip from 12 to 3 this afternoon,\r\naccompanying \"the City of Brussels\" down as far as the Narrows, in\r\nbehoof of some Europe-bound friends, to give them a good send off.\r\nOur spirited little tug, the \"Seth Low,\" kept close to the great black\r\n\"Brussels,\" sometimes one side, sometimes the other, always up to her,\r\nor even pressing ahead, (like the blooded pony accompanying the\r\nroyal elephant.) The whole affair, from the first, was an animated,\r\nquick-passing, characteristic New York scene; the large, good-looking,\r\nwell-dress'd crowd on the wharf-end--men and women come to see their\r\nfriends depart, and bid them God-speed--the ship's sides swarming with\r\npassengers--groups of bronze-faced sailors, with uniform' d officers at\r\ntheir posts--the quiet directions, as she quickly unfastens and moves\r\nout, prompt to a minute--the emotional faces, adieus and fluttering\r\nhandkerchiefs, and many smiles and some tears on the wharf--the\r\nanswering faces, smiles, tears and fluttering handkerchiefs, from the\r\nship--(what can be subtler and finer than this play of faces on\r\nsuch occasions in these responding crowds?--what go more to one's\r\nheart?)--the proud, steady, noiseless cleaving of the grand oceaner\r\ndown the bay--we speeding by her side a few miles, and then turning,\r\nwheeling,--amid a babel of wild hurrahs, shouted partings, ear-splitting\r\nsteam whistles, kissing of hands and waving of handkerchiefs.\r\n\r\nThis departing of the big steamers, noons or afternoons--there is no\r\nbetter medicine when one is listless or vapory. I am fond of going down\r\nWednesdays and Saturdays--their more special days--to watch them and the\r\ncrowds on the wharves, the arriving passengers, the general bustle and\r\nactivity, the eager looks from the faces, the clear-toned voices, (a\r\ntravel'd foreigner, a musician, told me the other day she thinks an\r\nAmerican crowd has the finest voices in the world,) the whole look of\r\nthe great, shapely black ships themselves, and their groups and lined\r\nsides--in the setting of our bay with the blue sky overhead. Two days\r\nafter the above I saw the \"Britannic,\" the \"Donau,\" the \"Helvetia\" and\r\nthe \"Schiedam\" steam out, all off for Europe--a magnificent sight.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO HOURS ON THE MINNESOTA\r\n\r\nFrom 7 to 9, aboard the United States school-ship Minnesota, lying up\r\nthe North river. Captain Luce sent his gig for us about sundown, to the\r\nfoot of Twenty-third street, and receiv'd us aboard with officer-like\r\nhospitality and sailor heartiness. There are several hundred youths on\r\nthe Minnesota to be train'd for efficiently manning the government navy.\r\nI like the idea much; and, so far as I have seen to-night, I like the\r\nway it is carried out on this huge vessel. Below, on the gun-deck, were\r\ngather'd nearly a hundred of the boys, to give us some of their singing\r\nexercises, with a melodeon accompaniment, play'd by one of their number.\r\nThey sang with a will. The best part, however, was the sight of the\r\nyoung fellows themselves. I went over among them before the singing\r\nbegan, and talk'd a few minutes informally. They are from all the\r\nStates; I asked for the Southerners, but could only find one, a lad from\r\nBaltimore. In age, apparently, they range from about fourteen years to\r\nnineteen or twenty. They are all of American birth, and have to pass a\r\nrigid medical examination; well-grown youths, good flesh, bright eyes,\r\nlooking straight at you, healthy, intelligent, not a slouch among them,\r\nnor a menial--in every one the promise of a man. I have been to many\r\npublic aggregations of young and old, and of schools and colleges, in\r\nmy day, but I confess I have never been so near satisfied, so comforted,\r\n(both from the fact of the school itself, and the splendid proof of our\r\ncountry, our composite race, and the sample-promises of its good average\r\ncapacities, its future,) as in the collection from all parts of the\r\nUnited States on this navy training ship. (\"Are there going to be _any\r\nmen_ there?\" was the dry and pregnant reply of Emerson to one who had\r\nbeen crowding him with the rich material statistics and possibilities of\r\nsome western or Pacific region.)\r\n\r\n_May 26_.--Aboard the Minnesota again. Lieut. Murphy kindly came for\r\nme in his boat. Enjoy'd specially those brief trips to and fro--the\r\nsailors, tann'd, strong, so bright and able-looking, pulling their oars\r\nin long side-swing, man-of-war style, as they row'd me across. I saw\r\nthe boys in companies drilling with small arms; had a talk with Chaplain\r\nRawson. At 11 o'clock all of us gathered to breakfast around a long\r\ntable in the great ward room--I among the rest--a genial, plentiful,\r\nhospitable affair every way--plenty to eat, and of the best; became\r\nacquainted with several new officers. This second visit, with its\r\nobservations, talks, (two or three at random with the boys,) confirm'd\r\nmy first impressions.\r\n\r\n\r\nMATURE SUMMER DAYS AND NIGHTS\r\n\r\n_Aug. 4_.--Forenoon--as I sit under the willow shade, (have retreated\r\ndown in the country again,) a little bird is leisurely dousing and\r\nflirting himself amid the brook almost within reach of me. He evidently\r\nfears me not--takes me for some concomitant of the neighboring earthy\r\nbanks, free bushery and wild weeds. _6 p.m._--The last three days have\r\nbeen perfect ones for the season, (four nights ago copious rains, with\r\nvehement thunder and lightning.) I write this sitting by the creek\r\nwatching my two kingfishers at their sundown sport. The strong,\r\nbeautiful, joyous creatures! Their wings glisten in the slanted sunbeams\r\nas they circle and circle around, occasionally dipping and dashing the\r\nwater, and making long stretches up and down the creek. Wherever I go\r\nover fields, through lanes, in by-places, blooms the white-flowering\r\nwild-carrot, its delicate pat of snow-flakes crowning its slender stem,\r\ngracefully oscillating in the breeze,\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPOSITION BUILDING--NEW CITY HALL--RIVER TRIP\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA, _Aug. 26_.--Last night and to-night of unsurpass'd\r\nclearness, after two days' rain; moon splendor and star splendor. Being\r\nout toward the great Exposition building, West Philadelphia, I saw it\r\nlit up, and thought I would go in. There was a ball, democratic but\r\nnice; plenty of young couples waltzing and quadrilling--music by a good\r\nstring-band. To the sight and hearing of these--to moderate strolls up\r\nand down the roomy spaces--to getting off aside, resting in an arm-chair\r\nand looking up a long while at the grand high roof with its graceful and\r\nmultitudinous work of iron rods, angles, gray colors, plays of light and\r\nshade, receding into dim outlines--to absorbing (in the intervals of the\r\nstring band,) some capital voluntaries and rolling caprices from the big\r\norgan at the other end of the building--to sighting a shadow'd figure\r\nor group or couple of lovers every now and then passing some near or\r\nfarther aisle--I abandon'd myself for over an hour.\r\n\r\nReturning home, riding down Market street in an open summer car,\r\nsomething detain'd us between Fifteenth and Broad, and I got out to view\r\nbetter the new, three-fifths-built marble edifice, the City Hall,\r\nof magnificent proportions--a majestic and lovely show there in the\r\nmoonlight--flooded all over, facades, myriad silver-white lines and\r\ncarv'd heads and mouldings, with the soft dazzle--silent, weird,\r\nbeautiful--well, I know that never when finish'd will that magnificent\r\npile impress one as it impress'd me those fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nTo-night, since, I have been long on the river. I watch the C-shaped\r\nNorthern Crown, (with the star Alshacca that blazed out so suddenly,\r\nalarmingly, one night a few years ago.) The moon in her third quarter,\r\nand up nearly all night. And there, as I look eastward, my long-absent\r\nPleiades, welcome again to sight. For an hour I enjoy the soothing and\r\nvital scene to the low splash of waves--new stars steadily, noiselessly\r\nrising in the east.\r\n\r\nAs I cross the Delaware, one of the deck-hands, F. R., tells me how\r\na woman jump'd overboard and was drown'd a couple of hours since. It\r\nhappen'd in mid-channel--she leap'd from the forward part of the boat,\r\nwhich went over her. He saw her rise on the other side in the swift\r\nrunning water, throw her arms and closed hands high up, (white hands\r\nand bare forearms in the moonlight like a flash,) and then she sank. (I\r\nfound out afterwards that this young fellow had promptly jump'd in, swam\r\nafter the poor creature, and made, though unsuccessfully, the bravest\r\nefforts to rescue her; but he didn't mention that part at all in telling\r\nme the story.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSWALLOWS ON THE RIVER\r\n\r\n_Sept. 3_--Cloudy and wet, and wind due east; air without palpable fog,\r\nbut very heavy with moisture--welcome for a change. Forenoon, crossing\r\nthe Delaware, I noticed unusual numbers of swallows in flight, circling,\r\ndarting, graceful beyond description, close to the water. Thick, around\r\nthe bows of the ferry-boat as she lay tied in her slip, they flew; and\r\nas we went out I watch'd beyond the pier-heads, and across the broad\r\nstream, their swift-winding loop-ribands of motion, down close to it,\r\ncutting and intersecting. Though I had seen swallows all my life, seem'd\r\nas though I never before realized their peculiar beauty and character in\r\nthe landscape. (Some time ago, for an hour, in a huge old country barn,\r\nwatching these birds flying, recall'd the 22d book of the Odyssey, where\r\nUlysses slays the suitors, bringing things to _eclaircissement_, and\r\nMinerva, swallow-bodied, darts up through the spaces of the hall, sits\r\nhigh on a beam, looks complacently on the show of slaughter, and feels\r\nin her element, exulting, joyous.)\r\n\r\n\r\nBEGIN A LONG JAUNT WEST\r\n\r\nThe following three or four months (Sept. to Dec. '79) I made quite a\r\nwestern journey, fetching up at Denver, Colorado, and penetrating the\r\nRocky Mountain region enough to get a good notion of it all. Left\r\nWest Philadelphia after 9 o'clock one night, middle of September, in a\r\ncomfortable sleeper. Oblivious of the two or three hundred miles across\r\nPennsylvania; at Pittsburgh in the morning to breakfast. Pretty good\r\nview of the city and Birmingham--fog and damp, smoke, coke-furnaces,\r\nflames, discolor'd wooden houses, and vast collections of coal-barges.\r\nPresently a bit of fine region, West Virginia, the Panhandle, and\r\ncrossing the river, the Ohio. By day through the latter State--then\r\nIndiana--and so rock'd to slumber for a second night, flying like\r\nlightning through Illinois.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE SLEEPER\r\n\r\nWhat a fierce weird pleasure to lie in my berth at night in the\r\nluxurious palace-car, drawn by the mighty Baldwin--embodying, and\r\nfilling me, too, full of the swiftest motion, and most resistless\r\nstrength! It is late, perhaps midnight or after--distances join'd like\r\nmagic--as we speed through Harrisburg, Columbus, Indianapolis. The\r\nelement of danger adds zest to it all. On we go, rumbling and flashing,\r\nwith our loud whinnies thrown out from time to time, or trumpet-blasts,\r\ninto the darkness. Passing the homes of men, the farms, barns,\r\ncattle--the silent villages. And the car itself, the sleeper, with\r\ncurtains drawn and lights turn'd down--in the berths the slumberers,\r\nmany of them women and children--as on, on, on, we fly like lightning\r\nthrough the night--how strangely sound and sweet they sleep! (They say\r\nthe French Voltaire in his time designated the grand opera and a ship of\r\nwar the most signal illustrations of the growth of humanity's and art's\r\nadvance beyond primitive barbarism. Perhaps if the witty philosopher\r\nwere here these days, and went in the same car with perfect bedding and\r\nfeed from New York to San Francisco, he would shift his type and sample\r\nto one of our American sleepers.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMISSOURI STATE\r\n\r\nWe should have made the run of 960 miles from Philadelphia to St. Louis\r\nin thirty-six hours, but we had a collision and bad locomotive smash\r\nabout two-thirds of the way, which set us back. So merely stopping over\r\nnight that time in St. Louis, I sped on westward. As I cross'd Missouri\r\nState the whole distance by the St. Louis and Kansas City Northern\r\nRailroad, a fine early autumn day, I thought my eyes had never looked on\r\nscenes of greater pastoral beauty. For over two hundred miles successive\r\nrolling prairies, agriculturally perfect view'd by Pennsylvania and New\r\nJersey eyes, and dotted here and there with fine timber. Yet fine as the\r\nland is, it isn't the finest portion; (there is a bed of impervious clay\r\nand hard-pan beneath this section that holds water too firmly, \"drowns\r\nthe land in wet weather, and bakes it in dry,\" as a cynical farmer told\r\nme.) South are some richer tracts, though perhaps the beauty-spots of\r\nthe State are the northwestern counties. Altogether, I am clear, (now,\r\nand from what I have seen and learn'd since,) that Missouri, in climate,\r\nsoil, relative situation, wheat, grass, mines, railroads, and every\r\nimportant materialistic respect, stands in the front rank of the Union.\r\nOf Missouri averaged politically and socially I have heard all sorts of\r\ntalk, some pretty severe--but I should have no fear myself of getting\r\nalong safely and comfortably anywhere among the Missourians. They raise\r\na good deal of tobacco. You see at this time quantities of the light\r\ngreenish-gray leaves pulled and hanging out to dry on temporary\r\nframeworks or rows of sticks. Looks much like the mullein familiar to\r\neastern eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAWRENCE AND TOPEKA, KANSAS\r\n\r\nWe thought of stopping in Kansas City, but when we got there we found\r\na train ready and a crowd of hospitable Kansians to take us on to\r\nLawrence, to which I proceeded. I shall not soon forget my good days\r\nin L., in company with Judge Usher and his sons, (especially John and\r\nLinton,) true westerners of the noblest type. Nor the similar days in\r\nTopeka. Nor the brotherly kindness of my RR. friends there, and the\r\ncity and State officials. Lawrence and Topeka are large, bustling,\r\nhalf-rural, handsome cities. I took two or three long drives about the\r\nlatter, drawn by a spirited team over smooth roads.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRAIRIES (_and an Undeliver'd Speech_)\r\n\r\nAt a large popular meeting at Topeka--the Kansas State Silver Wedding,\r\nfifteen or twenty thousand people--I had been erroneously bill'd\r\nto deliver a poem. As I seem'd to be made much of, and wanted to be\r\ngood-natured, I hastily pencill'd out the following little speech.\r\nUnfortunately, (or fortunately,) I had such a good time and rest, and\r\ntalk and dinner, with the U. boys, that I let the hours slip away and\r\ndidn't drive over to the meeting and speak my piece. But here it is just\r\nthe same:\r\n\r\n\"My friends, your bills announce me as giving a poem; but I have no\r\npoem--have composed none for this occasion. And I can honestly say I am\r\nnow glad of it. Under these skies resplendent in September beauty--amid\r\nthe peculiar landscape you are used to, but which is new to me--these\r\ninterminable and stately prairies--in the freedom and vigor and sane\r\nenthusiasm of this perfect western air and autumn sunshine--it seems\r\nto me a poem would be almost an impertinence. But if you care to have a\r\nword from me, I should speak it about these very prairies; they impress\r\nme most, of all the objective shows I see or have seen on this, my first\r\nreal visit to the West. As I have roll'd rapidly hither for more than\r\na thousand miles, through fair Ohio, through bread-raising Indiana and\r\nIllinois--through ample Missouri, that contains and raises everything;\r\nas I have partially explor'd your charming city during the last two\r\ndays, and, standing on Oread hill, by the university, have launch'd my\r\nview across broad expanses of living green, in every direction--I have\r\nagain been most impress'd, I say, and shall remain for the rest of my\r\nlife most impress'd, with that feature of the topography of your western\r\ncentral world--that vast Something, stretching out on its own unbounded\r\nscale, unconfined, which there is in these prairies, combining the real\r\nand ideal, and beautiful as dreams.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder indeed if the people of this continental inland West know how\r\nmuch of first-class _art_ they have in these prairies--how original and\r\nall your own--how much of the influences of a character for your future\r\nhumanity, broad, patriotic, heroic and new? how entirely they tally on\r\nland the grandeur and superb monotony of the skies of heaven, and the\r\nocean with its waters? how freeing, soothing, nourishing they are to the\r\nsoul?\r\n\r\n\"Then is it not subtly they who have given us our leading modern\r\nAmericans, Lincoln and Grant?--vast-spread, average men--their\r\nforegrounds of character altogether practical and real, yet (to those\r\nwho have eyes to see) with finest backgrounds of the ideal, towering\r\nhigh as any. And do we not see, in them, foreshadowings of the future\r\nraces that shall fill these prairies?\r\n\r\n\"Not but what the Yankee and Atlantic States, and every other\r\npart--Texas, and the States flanking the south-east and the Gulf of\r\nMexico--the Pacific shore empire--the Territories and Lakes, and the\r\nCanada line (the day is not yet, but it will come, including Canada\r\nentire)--are equally and integrally and indissolubly this Nation, the\r\n_sine qua non_ of the human, political and commercial New World. But\r\nthis favor'd central area of (in round numbers) two thousand miles\r\nsquare seems fated to be the home both of what I would call America's\r\ndistinctive ideas and distinctive realities.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nON TO DENVER--A FRONTIER INCIDENT\r\n\r\nThe jaunt of five or six hundred miles from Topeka to Denver took me\r\nthrough a variety of country, but all unmistakably prolific, western,\r\nAmerican, and on the largest scale. For a long distance we follow the\r\nline of the Kansas river, (I like better the old name, Kaw,) a stretch\r\nof very rich, dark soil, famed for its wheat, and call'd the Golden\r\nBelt--then plains and plains, hour after hour--Ellsworth county, the\r\ncentre of the State--where I must stop a moment to tell a characteristic\r\nstory of early days--scene the very spot where I am passing--time 1868.\r\nIn a scrimmage at some public gathering in the town, A. had shot\r\nB. quite badly, but had not kill'd him. The sober men of Ellsworth\r\nconferr'd with one another and decided that A. deserv'd punishment. As\r\nthey wished to set a good example and establish their reputation the\r\nreverse of a Lynching town, they open an informal court and bring both\r\nmen before them for deliberate trial. Soon as this trial begins the\r\nwounded man is led forward to give his testimony. Seeing his enemy\r\nin durance and unarm'd, B. walks suddenly up in a fury and shoots A.\r\nthrough the head--shoots him dead. The court is instantly adjourn'd, and\r\nits unanimous members, without a word of debate, walk the murderer B.\r\nout, wounded as he is, and hang him.\r\n\r\nIn due time we reach Denver, which city I fall in love with from the\r\nfirst, and have that feeling confirm'd, the longer I stay there. One of\r\nmy pleasantest days was a jaunt, via Platte cañon, to Leadville.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN HOUR ON KENOSHA SUMMIT\r\n\r\nJottings from the Rocky Mountains, mostly pencill'd during a day's trip\r\nover the South Park RR., returning from Leadville, and especially the\r\nhour we were detain'd, (much to my satisfaction,) at Kenosha summit. As\r\nafternoon advances, novelties, far-reaching splendors, accumulate under\r\nthe bright sun in this pure air. But I had better commence with the day.\r\n\r\nThe confronting of Platte cañon just at dawn, after a ten miles' ride in\r\nearly darkness on the rail from Denver--the seasonable stoppage at\r\nthe entrance of the cañon, and good breakfast of eggs, trout, and nice\r\ngriddle-cakes--then as we travel on, and get well in the gorge, all the\r\nwonders, beauty, savage power of the scene--the wild stream of water,\r\nfrom sources of snows, brawling continually in sight one side--the\r\ndazzling sun, and the morning lights on the rocks--such turns and\r\ngrades in the track, squirming around corners, or up and down hills--far\r\nglimpses of a hundred peaks, titanic necklaces, stretching north and\r\nsouth--the huge rightly-named Dome-rock--and as we dash along, others\r\nsimilar, simple, monolithic, elephantine.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EGOTISTICAL \"FIND\"\r\n\r\n\"I have found the law of my own poems,\" was the unspoken but\r\nmore-and-more decided feeling that came to me as I pass'd, hour after\r\nhour, amid all this grim yet joyous elemental abandon--this plenitude\r\nof material, entire absence of art, untrammel'd play of primitive\r\nNature--the chasm, the gorge, the crystal mountain stream,\r\nrepeated scores, hundreds of miles--the broad handling and absolute\r\nuncrampedness--the fantastic forms, bathed in transparent browns, faint\r\nreds and grays, towering sometimes a thousand, sometimes two or three\r\nthousand feet high--at their tops now and then huge masses pois'd, and\r\nmixing with the clouds, with only their outlines, hazed in misty lilac,\r\nvisible. (\"In Nature's grandest shows,\" says an old Dutch writer, an\r\necclesiastic, \"amid the ocean's depth, if so might be, or countless\r\nworlds rolling above at night, a man thinks of them, weighs all, not for\r\nthemselves or the abstract, but with reference to his own personality,\r\nand how they may affect him or color his destinies.\")\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW SENSES: NEW JOYS\r\n\r\nWe follow the stream of amber and bronze brawling along its bed,\r\nwith its frequent cascades and snow-white foam. Through the cañon we\r\nfly--mountains not only each side, but seemingly, till we get near,\r\nright in front of us--every rood a new view flashing, and each flash\r\ndefying description--on the almost perpendicular sides, clinging\r\npines, cedars, spruces, crimson sumach bushes, spots of wild grass--but\r\ndominating all, those towering rocks, rocks, rocks, bathed in delicate\r\nvari-colors, with the clear sky of autumn overhead. New senses, new\r\njoys, seem develop'd. Talk as you like, a typical Rocky Mountain cañon,\r\nor a limitless sea-like stretch of the great Kansas or Colorado plains,\r\nunder favoring circumstances, tallies, perhaps expresses, certainly\r\nawakes, those grandest and subtlest element-emotions in the human\r\nsoul, that all the marble temples and sculptures from Phidias to\r\nThorwaldsen--all paintings, poems, reminiscences, or even music,\r\nprobably never can.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEAM-POWER, TELEGRAPHS, ETC\r\n\r\nI get out on a ten minutes' stoppage at Deer creek, to enjoy the\r\nunequal'd combination of hill, stone and wood. As we speed again,\r\nthe yellow granite in the sunshine, with natural spires, minarets,\r\ncastellated perches far aloft--then long stretches of straight-upright\r\npalisades, rhinoceros color--then gamboge and tinted chromos. Ever\r\nthe best of my pleasures the cool-fresh Colorado atmosphere, yet\r\nsufficiently warm. Signs of man's restless advent and pioneerage, hard\r\nas Nature's face is--deserted dug-outs by dozens in the side-hills--the\r\nscantling-hut, the telegraph-pole, the smoke of some impromptu chimney\r\nor outdoor fire--at intervals little settlements of log-houses, or\r\nparties of surveyors or telegraph builders, with their comfortable\r\ntents. Once, a canvas office where you could send a message by\r\nelectricity anywhere around the world! Yes, pronounc'd signs of the man\r\nof latest dates, dauntlessly grappling with these grisliest shows of the\r\nold kosmos. At several places steam saw-mills, with their piles of logs\r\nand boards, and the pipes puffing. Occasionally Platte cañon expanding\r\ninto a grassy flat of a few acres. At one such place, toward the end,\r\nwhere we stop, and I get out to stretch my legs, as I look skyward, or\r\nrather mountain-topward, a huge hawk or eagle (a rare sight here) is\r\nidly soaring, balancing along the ether, now sinking low and coming\r\nquite near, and then up again in stately-languid circles--then higher,\r\nhigher, slanting to the north, and gradually out of sight.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICA'S BACK-BONE\r\n\r\nI jot these lines literally at Kenosha summit, where we return,\r\nafternoon, and take a long rest, 10,000 feet above sea-level. At\r\nthis immense height the South Park stretches fifty miles before me.\r\nMountainous chains and peaks in every variety of perspective, every hue\r\nof vista, fringe the view, in nearer, or middle, or far-dim distance,\r\nor fade on the horizon. We have now reach'd, penetrated the Rockies,\r\n(Hayden calls it the Front Range,) for a hundred miles or so; and though\r\nthese chains spread away in every direction, specially north and south,\r\nthousands and thousands farther, I have seen specimens of the utmost\r\nof them, and know henceforth at least what they are, and what they look\r\nlike. Not themselves alone, for they typify stretches and areas of half\r\nthe globe--are, in fact, the vertebrae or back-bone of our hemisphere.\r\nAs the anatomists say a man is only a spine, topp'd, footed, breasted\r\nand radiated, so the whole Western world is, in a sense, but an\r\nexpansion of these mountains. In South America they are the Andes, in\r\nCentral America and Mexico the Cordilleras, and in our States they\r\ngo under different names--in California the Coast and Cascade\r\nranges--thence more eastwardly the Sierra Nevadas--but mainly and more\r\ncentrally here the Rocky Mountains proper, with many an elevation such\r\nas Lincoln's, Grey's, Harvard's, Yale's, Long's and Pike's peaks, all\r\nover 14,000 feet high. (East, the highest peaks of the Alleghanies, the\r\nAdirondacks, the Catskills, and the White Mountains, range from 2000 to\r\n5500 feet-only Mount Washington, in the latter, 6300 feet.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PARKS\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all here, lie such beautiful contrasts as the sunken\r\nbasins of the North, Middle, and South Parks, (the latter I am now on\r\none side of, and overlooking,) each the size of a large, level, almost\r\nquandrangular, grassy, western county, wall'd in by walls of hills, and\r\neach park the source of a river. The ones I specify are the largest in\r\nColorado, but the whole of that State, and of Wyoming, Utah, Nevada and\r\nwestern California, through their sierras and ravines, are copiously\r\nmark'd by similar spreads and openings, many of the small ones of\r\nparadisiac loveliness and perfection, with their offsets of mountains,\r\nstreams, atmosphere and hues beyond compare.\r\n\r\n\r\nART FEATURES\r\n\r\nTalk, I say again, of going to Europe, of visiting the ruins of feudal\r\ncastles, or Coliseum remains, or kings' palaces--when you can come\r\n_here_. The alternations one gets, too; after the Illinois and Kansas\r\nprairies of a thousand miles--smooth and easy areas of the corn and\r\nwheat of ten million democratic farms in the future----here start up in\r\nevery conceivable presentation of shape, these non-utilitarian piles,\r\ncoping the skies, emanating a beauty, terror, power, more than Dante\r\nor Angelo ever knew. Yes, I think the chyle of not only poetry and\r\npainting, but oratory, and even the metaphysics and music fit for the\r\nNew World, before being finally assimilated, need first and feeding\r\nvisits here.\r\n\r\n_Mountain streams._--The spiritual contrast and etheriality of the whole\r\nregion consist largely to me in its never-absent peculiar streams--the\r\nsnows of inaccessible upper areas melting and running down through the\r\ngorges continually. Nothing like the water of pastoral plains, or creeks\r\nwith wooded banks and turf, or anything of the kind elsewhere. The\r\nshapes that element takes in the shows of the globe cannot be fully\r\nunderstood by an artist until he has studied these unique rivulets.\r\n\r\n_Aerial effects._--But perhaps as I gaze around me the rarest sight\r\nof all is in atmospheric hues. The prairies--as I cross'd them in my\r\njourney hither--and these mountains and parks, seem to me to afford\r\nnew lights and shades. Everywhere the aerial gradations and sky-effects\r\ninimitable; nowhere else such perspectives, such transparent lilacs\r\nand grays. I can conceive of some superior landscape painter, some fine\r\ncolorist, after sketching awhile out here, discarding all his previous\r\nwork, delightful to stock exhibition amateurs, as muddy, raw and\r\nartificial. Near one's eye ranges an infinite variety; high up, the bare\r\nwhitey-brown, above timber line; in certain spots afar patches of snow\r\nany time of year; (no trees, no flowers, no birds, at those chilling\r\naltitudes.) As I write I see the Snowy Range through the blue mist,\r\nbeautiful and far off, I plainly see the patches of snow.\r\n\r\n\r\nDENVER IMPRESSIONS\r\n\r\nThrough the long-lingering half-light of the most superb of evenings\r\nwe return'd to Denver, where I staid several days leisurely exploring,\r\nreceiving impressions, with which I may as well taper off this\r\nmemorandum, itemizing what I saw there. The best was the men,\r\nthree-fourths of them large, able, calm, alert, American. And cash! why\r\nthey create it here. Out in the smelting works, (the biggest and most\r\nimprov'd ones, for the precious metals, in the world,) I saw long rows\r\nof vats, pans, cover'd by bubbling-boiling water, and fill'd with pure\r\nsilver, four or five inches thick, many thousand dollars' worth in a\r\npan. The foreman who was showing me shovel'd it carelessly up with a\r\nlittle wooden shovel, as one might toss beans. Then large silver bricks,\r\nworth $2000 a brick, dozens of piles, twenty in a pile. In one place\r\nin the mountains, at a mining camp, I had a few days before seen rough\r\nbullion on the ground in the open air, like the confectioner's pyramids\r\nat some swell dinner in New York. (Such a sweet morsel to roll over with\r\na poor author's pen and ink--and appropriate to slip in here--that\r\nthe silver product of Colorado and Utah, with the gold product of\r\nCalifornia, New Mexico, Nevada and Dakota, foots up an addition to the\r\nworld's coin of considerably over a hundred millions every year.)\r\n\r\nA city, this Denver, well-laid out--Laramie street, and 15th and 16th\r\nand Champa streets, with others, particularly fine--some with tall\r\nstorehouses of stone or iron, and windows of plate-glass--all the\r\nstreets with little canals of mountain water running along the\r\nsides--plenty of people, \"business,\" modernness--yet not without a\r\ncertain racy wild smack, all its own. A place of fast horses, (many\r\nmares with their colts,) and I saw lots of big greyhounds for antelope\r\nhunting. Now and then groups of miners, some just come in, some starting\r\nout, very picturesque.\r\n\r\nOne of the papers here interview'd me, and reported me as saying\r\noff-hand: \"I have lived in or visited all the great cities on the\r\nAtlantic third of the republic--Boston, Brooklyn with its hills, New\r\nOrleans, Baltimore, stately Washington, broad Philadelphia, teeming\r\nCincinnati and Chicago, and for thirty years in that wonder, wash'd by\r\nhurried and glittering tides, my own New York, not only the New World's\r\nbut the world's city--but, newcomer to Denver as I am, and threading\r\nits streets, breathing its air, warm'd by its sunshine, and having what\r\nthere is of its human as well as aerial ozone flash'd upon me now for\r\nonly three or four days, I am very much like a man feels sometimes\r\ntoward certain people he meets with, and warms to, and hardly knows why.\r\nI, too, can hardly tell why, but as I enter'd the city in the slight\r\nhaze of a late September afternoon, and have breath'd its air, and\r\nslept well o' nights, and have roam'd or rode leisurely, and watch'd the\r\ncomers and goers at the hotels, and absorb'd the climatic magnetism of\r\nthis curiously attractive region, there has steadily grown upon me a\r\nfeeling of affection for the spot, which, sudden as it is, has become so\r\ndefinite and strong that I must put it on record.\"\r\n\r\nSo much for my feeling toward the Queen city of the plains and peaks,\r\nwhere she sits in her delicious rare atmosphere, over 5000 feet above\r\nsea-level, irrigated by mountain streams, one way looking east over\r\nthe prairies for a thousand miles, and having the other, westward,\r\nin constant view by day, draped in their violet haze, mountain tops\r\ninnumerable. Yes, I fell in love with Denver, and even felt a wish to\r\nspend my declining and dying days there.\r\n\r\n\r\nI TURN SOUTH AND THEN EAST AGAIN\r\n\r\nLeave Denver at 8 A.M. by the Rio Grande RR. going south. Mountains\r\nconstantly in sight in the apparently near distance, veil'd slightly,\r\nbut still clear and very grand--their cones, colors, sides, distinct\r\nagainst the sky--hundreds, it seem'd thousands, interminable necklaces\r\nof them, their tops and slopes hazed more or less slightly in that\r\nblue-gray, under the autumn sun, for over a hundred miles--the most\r\nspiritual show of objective Nature I ever beheld, or ever thought\r\npossible. Occasionally the light strengthens, making a contrast of\r\nyellow-tinged silver on one side, with dark and shaded gray on the\r\nother. I took a long look at Pike's peak, and was a little disappointed.\r\n(I suppose I had expected something stunning.) Our view over plains\r\nto the left stretches amply, with corrals here and there, the frequent\r\ncactus and wild sage, and herds of cattle feeding. Thus about 120\r\nmiles to Pueblo. At that town we board the comfortable and well-equipt\r\nAtchison, Topeka and Santa Fe RR., now striking east.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNFULFILLED WANTS--THE ARKANSAS RIVER\r\n\r\nI had wanted to go to the Yellowstone river region--wanted specially to\r\nsee the National Park, and the geysers and the \"hoodoo\" or goblin land\r\nof that country; indeed, hesitated a little at Pueblo, the turning\r\npoint--wanted to thread the Veta pass--wanted to go over the Santa\r\nFe trail away southwestward to New Mexico--but turn'd and set my face\r\neastward--leaving behind me whetting glimpse-tastes of southeastern\r\nColorado, Pueblo, Bald mountain, the Spanish peaks, Sangre de Christos,\r\nMile-Shoe-curve (which my veteran friend on the locomotive told me was\r\n\"the boss railroad curve of the universe,\") fort Garland on the plains,\r\nVeta, and the three great peaks of the Sierra Blancas. The Arkansas\r\nriver plays quite a part in the whole of this region--I see it, or\r\nits high-cut rocky northern shore, for miles, and cross and recross it\r\nfrequently, as it winds and squirms like a snake. The plains vary here\r\neven more than usual--sometimes a long sterile stretch of scores of\r\nmiles--then green, fertile and grassy, an equal length. Some very large\r\nherds of sheep. (One wants new words in writing about these plains, and\r\nall the inland American West--the terms, _far, large, vast_, &c., are\r\ninsufficient.)\r\n\r\n\r\nA SILENT LITTLE FOLLOWER-THE COREOPSIS\r\n\r\nHere I must say a word about a little follower, present even now before\r\nmy eyes. I have been accompanied on my whole journey from Barnegat to\r\nPike's peak by a pleasant floricultural friend, or rather millions of\r\nfriends--nothing more or less than a hardy little yellow five-petal'd\r\nSeptember and October wild-flower, growing I think everywhere in the\r\nmiddle and northern United States. I had seen it on the Hudson and over\r\nLong Island, and along the banks of the Delaware and through New Jersey,\r\n(as years ago up the Connecticut, and one fall by Lake Champlain.) This\r\ntrip it follow'd me regularly, with its slender stem and eyes of gold,\r\nfrom Cape May to the Kaw valley, and so through the cañons and to these\r\nplains. In Missouri I saw immense fields all bright with it. Toward\r\nwestern Illinois I woke up one morning in the sleeper and the first\r\nthing when I drew the curtain of my berth and look'd out was its pretty\r\ncountenance and bending neck.\r\n\r\n_Sept. 25th_.--Early morning--still going east after we leave Sterling,\r\nKansas, where I stopp'd a day and night. The sun up about half an hour;\r\nnothing can be fresher or more beautiful than this time, this region. I\r\nsee quite a field of my yellow flower in full bloom. At intervals dots\r\nof nice two-story houses, as we ride swiftly by. Over the immense area,\r\nflat as a floor, visible for twenty miles in every direction in the\r\nclear air, a prevalence of autumn-drab and reddish-tawny herbage--sparse\r\nstacks of hay and enclosures, breaking the landscape--as we rumble by,\r\nflocks of prairie-hens starting up. Between Sterling and Florence a\r\nfine country. (Remembrances to E. L., my old-young soldier friend of war\r\ntimes, and his wife and boy at S.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRAIRIES AND GREAT PLAINS IN POETRY\r\n\r\n(_After traveling Illinois, Missouri, Kansas and Colorado_) Grand as\r\nis the thought that doubtless the child is already born who will see\r\na hundred millions of people, the most prosperous and advanc'd of the\r\nworld, inhabiting these Prairies, the great Plains, and the valley of\r\nthe Mississippi, I could not help thinking it would be grander still\r\nto see all those inimitable American areas fused in the alembic of\r\na perfect poem, or other esthetic work, entirely western, fresh and\r\nlimitless--altogether our own, without a trace or taste of Europe's\r\nsoil, reminiscence, technical letter or spirit. My days and nights, as I\r\ntravel here--what an exhilaration!--not the air alone, and the sense\r\nof vastness, but every local sight and feature. Everywhere something\r\ncharacteristic--the cactuses, pinks, buffalo grass, wild sage--the\r\nreceding perspective, and the far circle-line of the horizon all times\r\nof day, especially forenoon--the clear, pure, cool, rarefied nutriment\r\nfor the lungs, previously quite unknown--the black patches and streaks\r\nleft by surface-conflagrations--the deep-plough'd furrow of the\r\n\"fire-guard\"--the slanting snow-racks built all along to shield\r\nthe railroad from winter drifts--the prairie-dogs and the herds\r\nof antelope--the curious \"dry rivers\"--occasionally a \"dug-out\" or\r\ncorral--Fort Riley and Fort Wallace--those towns of the northern plains,\r\n(like ships on the sea,) Eagle-Tail, Coyoté, Cheyenne, Agate, Monotony,\r\nKit Carson--with ever the ant-hill and the buffalo-wallow--ever the\r\nherds of cattle and the cow-boys (\"cow-punchers\") to me a strangely\r\ninteresting class, bright-eyed as hawks, with their swarthy complexions\r\nand their broad-brimm'd hats--apparently always on horseback, with loose\r\narms slightly raised and swinging as they ride.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPANISH PEAKS--EVENING ON THE PLAINS\r\n\r\nBetween Pueblo and Bent's fort, southward, in a clear afternoon\r\nsun-spell I catch exceptionally good glimpses of the Spanish peaks.\r\nWe are in southeastern Colorado--pass immense herds of cattle as our\r\nfirst-class locomotive rushes us along--two or three times crossing\r\nthe Arkansas, which we follow many miles, and of which river I get fine\r\nviews, sometimes for quite a distance, its stony, upright, not very\r\nhigh, palisade banks, and then its muddy flats. We pass Fort Lyon--lots\r\nof adobie houses--limitless pasturage, appropriately fleck'd with those\r\nherds of cattle--in due time the declining sun in the west--a sky of\r\nlimpid pearl over all--and so evening on the great plains. A calm,\r\npensive, boundless landscape--the perpendicular rocks of the north\r\nArkansas, hued in twilight--a thin line of violet on the southwestern\r\nhorizon--the palpable coolness and slight aroma--a belated cow-boy with\r\nsome unruly member of his herd--an emigrant wagon toiling yet a little\r\nfurther, the horses slow and tired--two men, apparently father and son,\r\njogging along on foot--and around all the indescribable _chiaroscuro_\r\nand sentiment, (profounder than anything at sea,) athwart these endless\r\nwilds.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICA'S CHARACTERISTIC LANDSCAPE\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally as to the capacity and sure future destiny of that\r\nplain and prairie area (larger than any European kingdom) it is the\r\ninexhaustible land of wheat, maize, wool, flax, coal, iron, beef and\r\npork, butter and cheese, apples and grapes--land of ten million virgin\r\nfarms--to the eye at present wild and unproductive--yet experts say\r\nthat upon it when irrigated may easily be grown enough wheat to feed the\r\nworld. Then as to scenery (giving my own thought and feeling,) while\r\nI know the standard claim is that Yosemite, Niagara falls, the upper\r\nYellowstone and the like, afford the greatest natural shows, I am not\r\nso sure but the Prairies and the Plains, while less stunning at first\r\nsight, last longer, fill the esthetic sense fuller, precede all the\r\nrest, and make North America's characteristic landscape.\r\n\r\nIndeed through the whole of this journey, with all its shows and\r\nvarieties, what most impress'd me, and will longest remain with me, are\r\nthese same prairies. Day after day, and night after night, to my eyes,\r\nto all my senses--the esthetic one most of all--they silently and\r\nbroadly unfolded. Even their simplest statistics are sublime.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARTH'S MOST IMPORTANT STREAM\r\n\r\nThe valley of the Mississippi river and its tributaries, (this stream\r\nand its adjuncts involve a big part of the question,) comprehends more\r\nthan twelve hundred thousand square miles, the greater part prairies. It\r\nis by far the most important stream on the globe, and would seem to have\r\nbeen marked out by design, slow-flowing from north to south, through\r\na dozen climates, all fitted for man's healthy occupancy, its outlet\r\nunfrozen all the year, and its line forming a safe, cheap continental\r\navenue for commerce and passage from the north temperate to the torrid\r\nzone. Not even the mighty Amazon (though larger in volume) on its line\r\nof east and west--not the Nile in Africa, nor the Danube in Europe, nor\r\nthe three great rivers of China, compare with it. Only the Mediterranean\r\nsea has play'd some such part in history, and all through the past,\r\nas the Mississippi is destined to play in the future. By its demesnes,\r\nwater'd and welded by its branches, the Missouri, the Ohio, the\r\nArkansas, the Red, the Yazoo, the St. Francis and others, it already\r\ncompacts twenty-five millions of people, not merely the most peaceful\r\nand money-making, but the most restless and warlike on earth. Its\r\nvalley, or reach, is rapidly concentrating the political power of the\r\nAmerican Union. One almost thinks it _is_ the Union--or soon will be.\r\nTake it out, with its radiations, and what would be left? From the car\r\nwindows through Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, or stopping some days along\r\nthe Topeka and Santa Fe road, in southern Kansas, and indeed wherever\r\nI went, hundreds and thousands of miles through this region, my eyes\r\nfeasted on primitive and rich meadows, some of them partially inhabited,\r\nbut far, immensely far more untouch'd, unbroken--and much of it more\r\nlovely and fertile in its unplough'd innocence than the fair and\r\nvaluable fields of New York's, Pennsylvania's, Maryland's or Virginia's\r\nrichest farms.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAIRIE ANALOGIES--THE TREE QUESTION\r\n\r\nThe word Prairie is French, and means literally meadow. The cosmical\r\nanalogies of our North American plains are the Steppes of Asia, the\r\nPampas and Llanos of South America, and perhaps the Saharas of Africa.\r\nSome think the plains have been originally lake-beds; others attribute\r\nthe absence of forests to the fires that almost annually sweep over\r\nthem--(the cause, in vulgar estimation, of Indian summer.) The tree\r\nquestion will soon become a grave one. Although the Atlantic slope,\r\nthe Rocky mountain region, and the southern portion of the Mississippi\r\nvalley, are well wooded, there are here stretches of hundreds and\r\nthousands of miles where either not a tree grows, or often useless\r\ndestruction has prevail'd; and the matter of the cultivation and spread\r\nof forests may well be press'd upon thinkers who look to the coming\r\ngenerations of the prairie States.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISSISSIPPI VALLEY LITERATURE\r\n\r\nLying by one rainy day in Missouri to rest after quite a long\r\nexploration--first trying a big volume I found there of \"Milton, Young,\r\nGray, Beattie and Collins,\" but giving it up for a bad job--enjoying\r\nhowever for awhile, as often before, the reading of Walter Scott's\r\npoems, \"Lay of the Last Minstrel,\" \"Marmion,\" and so on--I stopp'd and\r\nlaid down the book, and ponder'd the thought of a poetry that should in\r\ndue time express and supply the teeming region I was in the midst\r\nof, and have briefly touch'd upon. One's mind needs but a moment's\r\ndeliberation anywhere in the United States to see clearly enough that\r\nall the prevalent book and library poets, either as imported from\r\nGreat Britain, or follow'd and _doppel-gang'd_ here, are foreign to our\r\nStates, copiously as they are read by us all. But to fully understand\r\nnot only how absolutely in opposition to our times and lands, and how\r\nlittle and cramp'd, and what anachronisms and absurdities many of their\r\npages are, for American purposes, one must dwell or travel awhile in\r\nMissouri, Kansas and Colorado, and get rapport with their people and\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWill the day ever come--no matter how long deferr'd--when those\r\nmodels and lay-figures from the British islands--and even the precious\r\ntraditions of the classics--will be reminiscences, studies only? The\r\npure breath, primitiveness, boundless prodigality and amplitude, strange\r\nmixture of delicacy and power, of continence, of real and ideal, and\r\nof all original and first-class elements, of these prairies, the Rocky\r\nmountains, and of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers--will they ever\r\nappear in, and in some sort form a standard for our poetry and art? (I\r\nsometimes think that even the ambition of my friend Joaquin Miller to\r\nput them in, and illustrate them, places him ahead of the whole crowd.)\r\n\r\nNot long ago I was down New York bay, on a steamer, watching the sunset\r\nover the dark green heights of Navesink, and viewing all that inimitable\r\nspread of shore, shipping and sea, around Sandy Hook. But an intervening\r\nweek or two, and my eyes catch the shadowy outlines of the Spanish\r\npeaks. In the more than two thousand miles between, though of infinite\r\nand paradoxical variety, a curious and absolute fusion is doubtless\r\nsteadily annealing, compacting, identifying all. But subtler and wider\r\nand more solid, (to produce such compaction,) than the laws of the\r\nStates, or the common ground of Congress, or the Supreme Court, or the\r\ngrim welding of our national wars, or the steel ties of railroads,\r\nor all the kneading and fusing processes of our material and business\r\nhistory, past or present, would in my opinion be a great throbbing,\r\nvital, imaginative work, or series of works, or literature, in\r\nconstructing which the Plains, the Prairies, and the Mississippi river,\r\nwith the demesnes of its varied and ample valley, should be the concrete\r\nbackground, and America's humanity, passions, struggles, hopes, there\r\nand now--an _eclaircissement_ as it is and is to be, on the stage of\r\nthe New World, of all Time's hitherto drama of war, romance and\r\nevolution--should furnish the lambent fire, the ideal.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN INTERVIEWER'S ITEM\r\n\r\n_Oct. 17, '79_.--To-day one of the newspapers of St. Louis prints the\r\nfollowing informal remarks of mine on American, especially Western\r\nliterature: \"We called on Mr. Whitman yesterday and after a somewhat\r\ndesultory conversation abruptly asked him: 'Do you think we are to have\r\na distinctively American literature?' 'It seems to me,' said he,'that\r\nour work at present is to lay the foundations of a great nation\r\nin products, in agriculture, in commerce, in networks of\r\nintercommunication, and in all that relates to the comforts of vast\r\nmasses of men and families, with freedom of speech, ecclesiasticism, &c.\r\nThese we have founded and are carrying out on a grander scale than ever\r\nhitherto, and Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, Kansas and Colorado,\r\nseem to me to be the seat and field of these very facts and ideas.\r\nMaterialistic prosperity in all its varied forms, with those other\r\npoints that I mentioned, intercommunication and freedom, are first to\r\nbe attended to. When those have their results and get settled, then\r\na literature worthy of us will begin to be defined. Our American\r\nsuperiority and vitality are in the bulk of our people, not in a gentry\r\nlike the old world. The greatness of our army during the secession war,\r\nwas in the rank and file, and so with the nation. Other lands have their\r\nvitality in a few, a class, but we have it in the bulk of the people.\r\nOur leading men are not of much account and never have been, but the\r\naverage of the people is immense, beyond all history. Sometimes I think\r\nin all departments, literature and art included, that will be the way\r\nour superiority will exhibit itself. We will not have great individuals\r\nor great leaders, but a great average bulk, unprecedentedly great.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOMEN OF THE WEST\r\n\r\n_Kansas City_.--I am not so well satisfied with what I see of the women\r\nof the prairie cities. I am writing this where I sit leisurely in a\r\nstore in Main street, Kansas City, a streaming crowd on the sidewalks\r\nflowing by. The ladies (and the same in Denver) are all fashionably\r\ndrest, and have the look of \"gentility\" in face, manner and action, but\r\nthey do _not_ have, either in physique or the mentality appropriate\r\nto them, any high native originality of spirit or body, (as the men\r\ncertainly have, appropriate to them.) They are \"intellectual\" and\r\nfashionable, but dyspeptic-looking and generally doll-like; their\r\nambition evidently is to copy their eastern sisters. Something far\r\ndifferent and in advance must appear, to tally and complete the superb\r\nmasculinity of the west, and maintain and continue it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SILENT GENERAL\r\n\r\n_Sept. 28, '79_.--So General Grant, after circumambiating the world,\r\nhas arrived home again, landed in San Francisco yesterday, from the\r\nship City of Tokio from Japan. What a man he is! what a history! what an\r\nillustration--his life--of the capacities of that American individuality\r\ncommon to us all. Cynical critics are wondering \"what the people can\r\nsee in Grant\" to make such a hubbub about. They aver (and it is no\r\ndoubt true) that he has hardly the average of our day's literary and\r\nscholastic culture, and absolutely no pronounc'd genius or conventional\r\neminence of any sort. Correct: but he proves how an average western\r\nfarmer, mechanic, boatman, carried by tides of circumstances,\r\nperhaps caprices, into a position of incredible military or civic\r\nresponsibilities, (history has presented none more trying, no born\r\nmonarch's, no mark more shining for attack or envy,) may steer his way\r\nfitly and steadily through them all, carrying the country and himself\r\nwith credit year after year--command over a million armed men--fight\r\nmore than fifty pitch'd battles--rule for eight years a land larger than\r\nall the kingdoms of Europe combined--and then, retiring, quietly (with\r\na cigar in his mouth) make the promenade of the whole world, through its\r\ncourts and coteries, and kings and czars and mikados, and splendidest\r\nglitters and etiquettes, as phlegmatically as he ever walk'd the\r\nportico of a Missouri hotel after dinner. I say all this is what people\r\nlike--and I am sure I like it. Seems to me it transcends Plutarch. How\r\nthose old Greeks, indeed, would have seized on him! A mere plain man--no\r\nart, no poetry--only practical sense, ability to do, or try his best to\r\ndo, what devolv'd upon him. A common trader, money-maker, tanner, farmer\r\nof Illinois--general for the republic, in its terrific struggle with\r\nitself, in the war of attempted secession--President following, (a task\r\nof peace, more difficult than the war itself)--nothing heroic, as the\r\nauthorities put it--and yet the greatest hero. The gods, the destinies,\r\nseem to have concentrated upon him.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT HAYES'S SPEECHES\r\n\r\n_Sept. 30_.--I see President Hayes has come out West, passing quite\r\ninformally from point to point, with his wife and a small cortege of\r\nbig officers, receiving ovations, and making daily and sometimes\r\ndouble-daily addresses to the people. To these addresses--all impromptu,\r\nand some would call them ephemeral--I feel to devote a memorandum. They\r\nare shrewd, good-natur'd, face-to-face speeches, on easy topics not\r\ntoo deep; but they give me some revised ideas of oratory--of a new,\r\nopportune theory and practice of that art, quite changed from the\r\nclassic rules, and adapted to our days, our occasions, to American\r\ndemocracy, and to the swarming populations of the West. I hear them\r\ncriticised as wanting in dignity, but to me they are just what they\r\nshould be, considering all the circumstances, who they come from, and\r\nwho they are address'd to. Underneath, his objects are to compact and\r\nfraternize the States, encourage their materialistic and industrial\r\ndevelopment, soothe and expand their self-poise, and tie all and each\r\nwith resistless double ties not only of inter-trade barter, but human\r\ncomradeship.\r\n\r\nFrom Kansas City I went on to St. Louis, where I remain'd nearly three\r\nmonths, with my brother T.J.W., and my dear nieces.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. LOUIS MEMORANDA\r\n\r\n_Oct., Nov., and Dec., '79_.--The points of St. Louis are its position,\r\nits absolute wealth, (the long accumulations of time and trade, solid\r\nriches, probably a higher average thereof than any city,) the unrivall'd\r\namplitude of its well-laid-out environage of broad plateaus, for\r\nfuture expansion--and the great State of which it is the head. It fuses\r\nnorthern and southern qualities, perhaps native and foreign ones, to\r\nperfection, rendezvous the whole stretch of the Mississippi and Missouri\r\nrivers, and its American electricity goes well with its German phlegm.\r\nFourth, Fifth and Third streets are store-streets, showy, modern,\r\nmetropolitan, with hurrying crowds, vehicles, horse-cars, hubbub, plenty\r\nof people, rich goods, plate-glass windows, iron fronts often five or\r\nsix stories high. You can purchase anything in St. Louis (in most of the\r\nbig western cities for the matter of that) just as readily and cheaply\r\nas in the Atlantic marts. Often in going about the town you see\r\nreminders of old, even decay'd civilization. The water of the west, in\r\nsome places, is not good, but they make it up here by plenty of very\r\nfair wine, and inexhaustible quantities of the best beer in the world.\r\nThere are immense establishments for slaughtering beef and pork--and I\r\nsaw flocks of sheep, 5000 in a flock. (In Kansas City I had visited a\r\npacking establishment that kills and packs an average of 2500 hogs a\r\nday the whole year round, for export. Another in Atchison, Kansas, same\r\nextent; others nearly equal elsewhere. And just as big ones here.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNIGHTS ON THE MISSISSIPPI\r\n\r\n_Oct. 29th, 30th, and 31st_.--Wonderfully fine, with the full harvest\r\nmoon, dazzling and silvery. I have haunted the river every night lately,\r\nwhere I could get a look at the bridge by moonlight. It is indeed a\r\nstructure of perfection and beauty unsurpassable, and I never tire of\r\nit. The river at present is very low; I noticed to-day it had much more\r\nof a blue-clear look than usual. I hear the slight ripples, the air\r\nis fresh and cool, and the view, up or down, wonderfully clear, in the\r\nmoonlight. I am out pretty late: it is so fascinating, dreamy. The cool\r\nnight-air, all the influences, the silence, with those far-off eternal\r\nstars, do me good. I have been quite ill of late. And so, well-near the\r\ncentre of our national demesne, these night views of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPON OUR OWN LAND\r\n\r\n\"Always, after supper, take a walk half a mile long,\" says an old\r\nproverb, dryly adding, \"and if convenient let it be upon your own land.\"\r\nI wonder does any other nation but ours afford opportunity for such a\r\njaunt as this? Indeed has any previous period afforded it? No one, I\r\ndiscover, begins to know the real geographic, democratic, indissoluble\r\nAmerican Union in the present, or suspect it in the future, until he\r\nexplores these Central States, and dwells awhile observantly on their\r\nprairies, or amid their busy towns, and the mighty father of waters. A\r\nride of two or three thousand miles, \"on one's own land,\" with hardly a\r\ndisconnection, could certainly be had in no other place than the United\r\nStates, and at no period before this. If you want to see what the\r\nrailroad is, and how civilization and progress date from it--how it\r\nis the conqueror of crude nature, which it turns to man's use, both on\r\nsmall scales and on the largest--come hither to inland America.\r\n\r\nI return'd home, east, Jan. 5, 1880, having travers'd, to and fro and\r\nacross, 10,000 miles and more. I soon resumed my seclusions down in\r\nthe woods, or by the creek, or gaddings about cities, and an occasional\r\ndisquisition, as will be seen following.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDGAR POE'S SIGNIFICANCE\r\n\r\n_Jan. 1, '80_.--In diagnosing this disease called humanity--to assume\r\nfor the nonce what seems a chief mood of the personality and writings of\r\nmy subject--I have thought that poets, somewhere or other on the list,\r\npresent the most mark'd indications. Comprehending artists in a mass,\r\nmusicians, painters, actors, and so on, and considering each and all of\r\nthem as radiations or flanges of that furious whirling wheel, poetry,\r\nthe centre and axis of the whole, where else indeed may we so well\r\ninvestigate the causes, growths, tally-marks of the time--the age's\r\nmatter and malady?\r\n\r\nBy common consent there is nothing better for man or woman than a\r\nperfect and noble life, morally without flaw, happily balanced in\r\nactivity, physically sound and pure, giving its due proportion, and no\r\nmore, to the sympathetic, the human emotional element--a life, in all\r\nthese, unhasting, unresting, untiring to the end. And yet there is\r\nanother shape of personality dearer far to the artist-sense, (which\r\nlikes the play of strongest lights and shades,) where the perfect\r\ncharacter, the good, the heroic, although never attain'd, is never\r\nlost sight of, but through failures, sorrows, temporary downfalls, is\r\nreturn'd to again and again, and while often violated, is passionately\r\nadhered to as long as mind, muscles, voice, obey the power we call\r\nvolition. This sort of personality we see more or less in Burns, Byron,\r\nSchiller, and George Sand. But we do not see it in Edgar Poe. (All this\r\nis the result of reading at intervals the last three days a new volume\r\nof his poems--I took it on my rambles down by the pond, and by degrees\r\nread it all through there.) While to the character first outlined the\r\nservice Poe renders is certainly that entire contrast and contradiction\r\nwhich is next best to fully exemplifying it.\r\n\r\nAlmost without the first sign of moral principle, or of the concrete\r\nor its heroisms, or the simpler affections of the heart, Poe's verses\r\nillustrate an intense faculty for technical and abstract beauty, with\r\nthe rhyming art to excess, an incorrigible propensity toward nocturnal\r\nthemes, a demoniac undertone behind every page--and, by final judgment,\r\nprobably belong among the electric lights of imaginative literature,\r\nbrilliant and dazzling, but with no heat. There is an indescribable\r\nmagnetism about the poet's life and reminiscences, as well as the poems.\r\nTo one who could work out their subtle retracing and retrospect, the\r\nlatter would make a close tally no doubt between the author's birth\r\nand antecedents, his childhood and youth, his physique, his so-call'd\r\neducation, his studies and associates, the literary and social\r\nBaltimore, Richmond, Philadelphia and New York, of those times--not only\r\nthe places and circumstances in themselves, but often, very often, in a\r\nstrange spurning of, and reaction from them all.\r\n\r\nThe following from a report in the Washington \"Star\" of November 16,\r\n1875, may afford those who care for it something further of my point\r\nof view toward this interesting figure and influence of our era.\r\nThere occurr'd about that date in Baltimore a public reburial of Poe's\r\nremains, and dedication of a monument over the grave:\r\n\r\n\"Being in Washington on a visit at the time, 'the old gray' went over\r\nto Baltimore, and though ill from paralysis, consented to hobble up and\r\nsilently take a seat on the platform, but refused to make any speech,\r\nsaying, 'I have felt a strong impulse to come over and be here to-day\r\nmyself in memory of Poe, which I have obey'd, but not the slightest\r\nimpulse to make a speech, which, my dear friends, must also be obeyed.'\r\nIn an informal circle, however, in conversation after the ceremonies,\r\nWhitman said: 'For a long while, and until lately, I had a distaste\r\nfor Poe's writings. I wanted, and still want for poetry, the clear sun\r\nshining, and fresh air blowing--the strength and power of health, not of\r\ndelirium, even amid the stormiest passions--with always the background\r\nof the eternal moralities. Non-complying with these requirements, Poe's\r\ngenius has yet conquer'd a special recognition for itself, and I too\r\nhave come to fully admit it, and appreciate it and him.\r\n\r\n\"'In a dream I once had, I saw a vessel on the sea, at midnight, in a\r\nstorm. It was no great full-rigg'd ship, nor majestic steamer, steering\r\nfirmly through the gale, but seem'd one of those superb little schooner\r\nyachts I had often seen lying anchor'd, rocking so jauntily, in the\r\nwaters around New York, or up Long Island sound--now flying uncontroll'd\r\nwith torn sails and broken spars through the wild sleet and winds and\r\nwaves of the night. On the deck was a slender, slight, beautiful\r\nfigure, a dim man, apparently enjoying all the terror, the murk, and the\r\ndislocation of which he was the centre and the victim. That figure of my\r\nlurid dream might stand for Edgar Poe, his spirit, his fortunes, and his\r\npoems--themselves all lurid dreams.'\"\r\n\r\nMuch more may be said, but I most desired to exploit the idea put at the\r\nbeginning. By its popular poets the calibres of an age, the weak spots\r\nof its embankments, its sub-currents, (often more significant than the\r\nbiggest surface ones,) are unerringly indicated. The lush and the weird\r\nthat have taken such extraordinary possession of Nineteenth century\r\nverse-lovers--what mean they? The inevitable tendency of poetic culture\r\nto morbidity, abnormal beauty--the sickliness of all technical thought\r\nor refinement in itself--the abnegation of the perennial and democratic\r\nconcretes at first hand, the body, the earth and sea, sex and the\r\nlike--and the substitution of something for them at second or third\r\nhand--what bearings have they on current pathological study?\r\n\r\n\r\nBEETHOVEN'S SEPTETTE\r\n\r\n_Feb. 11, '80_.--At a good concert to-night in the foyer of the opera\r\nhouse, Philadelphia--the band a small but first-rate one. Never\r\ndid music more sink into and soothe and fill me--never so prove its\r\nsoul-rousing power, its impossibility of statement. Especially in the\r\nrendering of one of Beethoven's master septettes by the well-chosen and\r\nperfectly-combined instruments (violins, viola, clarionet, horn, 'cello\r\nand contrabass,) was I carried away, seeing, absorbing many wonders.\r\nDainty abandon, sometimes as if Nature laughing on a hillside in the\r\nsunshine; serious and firm monotonies, as of winds; a horn sounding\r\nthrough the tangle of the forest, and the dying echoes; soothing\r\nfloating of waves, but presently rising in surges, angrily lashing,\r\nmuttering, heavy; piercing peals of laughter, for interstices; now\r\nand then weird, as Nature herself is in certain moods--but mainly\r\nspontaneous, easy, careless--often the sentiment of the postures of\r\nnaked children playing or sleeping. It did me good even to watch the\r\nviolinists drawing their bows so masterly--every motion a study. I\r\nallow'd myself, as I sometimes do, to wander out of myself. The conceit\r\ncame to me of a copious grove of singing birds, and in their midst\r\na simple harmonic duo, two human souls, steadily asserting their own\r\npensiveness, joyousness.\r\n\r\n\r\nA HINT OF WILD NATURE\r\n\r\n_Feb. 13_.--As I was crossing the Delaware to-day, saw a large flock\r\nof wild geese, right overhead, not very high up, ranged in V-shape,\r\nin relief against the noon clouds of light smoke-color. Had a capital\r\nthough momentary view of them, and then of their course on and on\r\nsoutheast, till gradually fading--(my eyesight yet first rate for\r\nthe open air and its distances, but I use glasses for reading.) Queer\r\nthoughts melted into me the two or three minutes, or less, seeing\r\nthese creatures cleaving the sky--the spacious, airy realm--even the\r\nprevailing smoke-gray color everywhere, (no sun shining)--the\r\nwaters below--the rapid flight of the birds, appearing just for a\r\nminute--flashing to me such a hint of the whole spread of Nature, with\r\nher eternal unsophisticated freshness, her never-visited recesses of\r\nsea, sky, shore--and then disappearing in the distance.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOAFING IN THE WOODS\r\n\r\n_March 8_.--I write this down in the country again, but in a new spot,\r\nseated on a log in the woods, warm, sunny, midday. Have been loafing\r\nhere deep among the trees, shafts of tall pines, oak, hickory, with\r\na thick undergrowth of laurels and grapevines--the ground cover'd\r\neverywhere by debris, dead leaves, breakage, moss--everything solitary,\r\nancient, grim. Paths (such as they are) leading hither and yon--(how\r\nmade I know not, for nobody seems to come here, nor man nor\r\ncattle-kind.) Temperature to-day about 60, the wind through the\r\npine-tops; I sit and listen to its hoarse sighing above (and to the\r\n_stillness_) long and long, varied by aimless rambles in the old roads\r\nand paths, and by exercise-pulls at the young saplings, to keep my\r\njoints from getting stiff. Blue-birds, robins, meadow-larks begin to\r\nappear.\r\n\r\n_Next day, 9th_.--A snowstorm in the morning, and continuing most of the\r\nday. But I took a walk over two hours, the same woods and paths, amid\r\nthe falling flakes. No wind, yet the musical low murmur through the\r\npines, quite pronounced, curious, like waterfalls, now still'd,\r\nnow pouring again. All the senses, sight, sound, smell, delicately\r\ngratified. Every snowflake lay where it fell on the evergreens,\r\nholly-trees, laurels, &c., the multitudinous leaves and branches piled,\r\nbulging-white, defined by edge-lines of emerald--the tall straight\r\ncolumns of the plentiful bronze-topt pines--a slight resinous odor\r\nblending with that of the snow. (For there is a scent to everything,\r\neven the snow, if you can only detect it--no two places, hardly any\r\ntwo hours, anywhere, exactly alike. How different the odor of noon from\r\nmidnight, or winter from summer, or a windy spell from a still one.)\r\n\r\n\r\nA CONTRALTO VOICE\r\n\r\n_May 9, Sunday_.--Visit this evening to my friends the J.'s--good\r\nsupper, to which I did justice--lively chat with Mrs. J. and I. and\r\nJ. As I sat out front on the walk afterward, in the evening air, the\r\nchurch-choir and organ on the corner opposite gave Luther's hymn, _Ein\r\nfeste berg_, very finely. The air was borne by a rich contralto. For\r\nnearly half an hour there in the dark (there was a good string of\r\nEnglish stanzas,) came the music, firm and unhurried, with long pauses.\r\nThe full silver star-beams of Lyra rose silently over the church's dim\r\nroof-ridge. Vari-color'd lights from the stain'd glass windows broke\r\nthrough the tree-shadows. And under all--under the Northern Crown up\r\nthere, and in the fresh breeze below, and the _chiaroscuro_ of the\r\nnight, that liquid-full contralto.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEEING NIAGARA TO ADVANTAGE\r\n\r\n_June 4, '80_.--For really seizing a great picture or book, or piece of\r\nmusic, or architecture, or grand scenery--or perhaps for the first time\r\neven the common sunshine, or landscape, or may-be even the mystery\r\nof identity, most curious mystery of all--there comes some lucky\r\nfive minutes of a man's life, set amid a fortuitous concurrence of\r\ncircumstances, and bringing in a brief flash the culmination of years of\r\nreading and travel and thought. The present case about two o'clock this\r\nafternoon, gave me Niagara, its superb severity of action and color and\r\nmajestic grouping, in one short, indescribable show. We were very slowly\r\ncrossing the Suspension bridge-not a full stop anywhere, but next to\r\nit--the day clear, sunny, still--and I out on the platform. The\r\nfalls were in plain view about a mile off, but very distinct, and no\r\nroar--hardly a murmur. The river tumbling green and white, far below\r\nme; the dark high banks, the plentiful umbrage, many bronze cedars, in\r\nshadow; and tempering and arching all the immense materiality, a clear\r\nsky overhead, with a few white clouds, limpid, spiritual, silent. Brief,\r\nand as quiet as brief, that picture--a remembrance always afterwards.\r\nSuch are the things, indeed, I lay away with my life's rare and blessed\r\nbits of hours, reminiscent, past--the wild sea-storm I once saw one\r\nwinter day, off Fire island--the elder Booth in Richard, that famous\r\nnight forty years ago in the old Bowery--or Alboni in the children's\r\nscene in Norma--or night-views, I remember, on the field, after battles\r\nin Virginia--or the peculiar sentiment of moonlight and stars over the\r\ngreat Plains, western Kansas--or scooting up New York bay, with a stiff\r\nbreeze and a good yacht, off Navesink. With these, I say, I henceforth\r\nplace that view, that afternoon, that combination complete, that five\r\nminutes' perfect absorption of Niagara--not the great majestic gem\r\nalone by itself, but set complete in all its varied, full, indispensable\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAUNTING TO CANADA\r\n\r\nTo go back a little, I left Philadelphia, 9th and Green streets, at 8\r\no'clock P.M., June 3, on a first-class sleeper, by the Lehigh Valley\r\n(North Pennsylvania) route, through Bethlehem, Wilkesbarre, Waverly, and\r\nso (by Erie) on through Corning to Hornellsville, where we arrived at 8,\r\nmorning, and had a bounteous breakfast. I must say I never put in such a\r\ngood night on any railroad track--smooth, firm, the minimum of jolting,\r\nand all the swiftness compatible with safety. So without change to\r\nBuffalo, and thence to Clifton, where we arrived early afternoon; then\r\non to London, Ontario, Canada, in four more--less than twenty-two hours\r\naltogether. I am domiciled at the hospitable house of my friends Dr. and\r\nMrs. Bucke, in the ample and charming garden and lawns of the asylum.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNDAY WITH THE INSANE\r\n\r\n_June 6_.--Went over to the religious services (Episcopal) main Insane\r\nasylum, held in a lofty, good-sized hall, third story. Plain boards,\r\nwhitewash, plenty of cheap chairs, no ornament or color, yet all\r\nscrupulously clean and sweet. Some three hundred persons present, mostly\r\npatients. Everything, the prayers, a short sermon, the firm, orotund\r\nvoice of the minister, and most of all, beyond any portraying, or\r\nsuggesting, _that audience_, deeply impress'd me. I was furnish'd with\r\nan arm-chair near the pulpit, and sat facing the motley, yet perfectly\r\nwell-behaved and orderly congregation. The quaint dresses and bonnets\r\nof some of the women, several very old and gray, here and there like\r\nthe heads in old pictures. O the looks that came from those faces! There\r\nwere two or three I shall probably never forget. Nothing at all markedly\r\nrepulsive or hideous--strange enough I did not see one such. Our common\r\nhumanity, mine and yours, everywhere:\r\n\r\n    \"The same old blood--the same red, running blood;\"\r\n\r\nyet behind most, an inferr'd arriere of such storms, such wrecks, such\r\nmysteries, fires, love, wrong, greed for wealth, religious problems,\r\ncrosses--mirror'd from those crazed faces (yet now temporarily so\r\ncalm, like still waters,) all the woes and sad happenings of life and\r\ndeath--now from every one the devotional element radiating--was it not,\r\nindeed, _the peace of God that passeth all understanding_, strange as it\r\nmay sound? I can only say that I took long and searching eyesweeps as\r\nI sat there, and it seem'd so, rousing unprecedented thoughts, problems\r\nunanswerable. A very fair choir, and melodeon accompaniment. They sang\r\n\"Lead, kindly light,\" after the sermon. Many join'd in the beautiful\r\nhymn, to which the minister read the introductory text, _In the daytime\r\nalso He led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire_.\r\nThen the words:\r\n\r\n    Lead, kindly light, amid the encircling gloom,\r\n             Lead thou me on.\r\n    The night is dark, and I am far from home;\r\n             Lead thou me on.\r\n    Keep thou my feet; I do not ask to see\r\n    The distant scene; one step enough for me.\r\n\r\n    I was not ever thus, nor pray'd that thou\r\n             Should'st lead me on;\r\n    I lov'd to choose and see my path; but now\r\n             Lead thou me on.\r\n    I loved the garish day, and spite of fears\r\n    Pride ruled my will; remember not past years.\r\n\r\nA couple of days after, I went to the \"Refractory building,\" under\r\nspecial charge of Dr. Beemer, and through the wards pretty thoroughly,\r\nboth the men's and women's. I have since made many other visits of the\r\nkind through the asylum, and around among the detach'd cottages. As far\r\nas I could see, this is among the most advanced, perfected, and kindly\r\nand rationally carried on, of all its kind in America. It is a town in\r\nitself, with many buildings and a thousand inhabitants.\r\n\r\nI learn that Canada, and especially this ample and populous province,\r\nOntario, has the very best and plentiest benevolent institutions in all\r\ndepartments.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMINISCENCE OF ELIAS HICKS\r\n\r\n_June 8_.--To-day a letter from Mrs. E. S. L., Detroit, accompanied in\r\na little post-office roll by a rare old engraved head of Elias Hicks,\r\n(from a portrait in oil by Henry Inman, painted for J. V. S., must have\r\nbeen 60 years or more ago, in New York)--among the rest the following\r\nexcerpt about E. H. in the letter:\r\n\r\n  \"I have listen'd to his preaching so often when a child, and sat with\r\n  my mother at social gatherings where he was the centre, and every one\r\n  so pleas'd and stirr'd by his conversation. I hear that you contemplate\r\n  writing or speaking about him, and I wonder'd whether you had a picture\r\n  of him. As I am the owner of two, I send you one.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAND NATIVE GROWTH\r\n\r\nIn a few days I go to lake Huron, and may have something to say of\r\nthat region and people. From what I already see, I should say the young\r\nnative population of Canada was growing up, forming a hardy, democratic,\r\nintelligent, radically sound, and just as American, good-natured and\r\n_individualistic_ race, as the average range of best specimens among\r\nus. As among us, too, I please myself by considering that this element,\r\nthough it may not be the majority, promises to be the leaven which must\r\neventually leaven the whole lump.\r\n\r\n\r\nA ZOLLVEREIN BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CANADA\r\n\r\nSome of the more liberal of the presses here are discussing the question\r\nof a zollverein between the United States and Canada. It is proposed to\r\nform a union for commercial purposes--to altogether abolish the frontier\r\ntariff line, with its double sets of custom house officials now existing\r\nbetween the two countries, and to agree upon one tariff for both, the\r\nproceeds of this tariff to be divided between the two governments on the\r\nbasis of population. It is said that a large proportion of the merchants\r\nof Canada are in favor of this step, as they believe it would materially\r\nadd to the business of the country, by removing the restrictions that\r\nnow exist on trade between Canada and the States. Those persons who\r\nare opposed to the measure believe that it would increase the material\r\nwelfare or the country, but it would loosen the bonds between Canada\r\nand England; and this sentiment overrides the desire for commercial\r\nprosperity. Whether the sentiment can continue to bear the strain\r\nput upon it is a question. It is thought by many that commercial\r\nconsiderations must in the end prevail. It seems also to be generally\r\nagreed that such a zollverein, or common customs union, would bring\r\npractically more benefits to the Canadian provinces than to the United\r\nStates. (It seems to me a certainty of time, sooner or later, that\r\nCanada shall form two or three grand States, equal and independent, with\r\nthe rest of the American Union. The St. Lawrence and lakes are not for a\r\nfrontier line, but a grand interior or mid-channel.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ST. LAWRENCE LINE\r\n\r\n_August 20_.--Premising that my three or four months in Canada were\r\nintended, among the rest, as an exploration of the line of the St.\r\nLawrence, from lake Superior to the sea, (the engineers here insist upon\r\nconsidering it as one stream, over 2000 miles long, including lakes and\r\nNiagara and all)--that I have only partially carried out my programme;\r\nbut for the seven or eight hundred miles so far fulfill'd, I find that\r\nthe _Canada question_ is absolutely control'd by this vast water line,\r\nwith its first-class features and points of trade, humanity, and\r\nmany more--here I am writing this nearly a thousand miles north of my\r\nPhiladelphia starting-point (by way of Montreal and Quebec) in the midst\r\nof regions that go to a further extreme of grimness, wildness of\r\nbeauty, and a sort of still and pagan _scaredness_, while yet Christian,\r\ninhabitable, and partially fertile, than perhaps any other on earth. The\r\nweather remains perfect; some might call it a little cool, but I wear my\r\nold gray overcoat and find it just right. The days are full of sunbeams\r\nand oxygen. Most of the forenoons and afternoons I am on the forward\r\ndeck of the steamer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SAVAGE SAGUENAY\r\n\r\nUp these black waters, over a hundred miles--always strong, deep,\r\n(hundreds of feet, sometimes thousands,) ever with high, rocky hills for\r\nbanks, green and gray--at times a little like some parts of the Hudson,\r\nbut much more pronounc'd and defiant. The hills rise higher--keep their\r\nranks more unbroken. The river is straighter and of more resolute flow,\r\nand its hue, though dark as ink, exquisitely polish'd and sheeny\r\nunder the August sun. Different, indeed, this Saguenay from all other\r\nrivers--different effects--a bolder, more vehement play of lights\r\nand shades. Of a rare charm of singleness and simplicity. (Like the\r\norgan-chant at midnight from the old Spanish convent, in \"Favorita\"--one\r\nstrain only, simple and monotonous and unornamented--but indescribably\r\npenetrating and grand and masterful.) Great place for echoes: while\r\nour steamer was tied at the wharf at Tadousac (taj-oo-sac) waiting, the\r\nescape-pipe letting off steam, I was sure I heard a band at the hotel up\r\nin the rocks--could even make out some of the tunes. Only when our pipe\r\nstopp'd, I knew what caused it. Then at cape Eternity and Trinity rock,\r\nthe pilot with his whistle producing similar marvellous results, echoes\r\nindescribably weird, as we lay off in the still bay under their shadows.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPES ETERNITY AND TRINITY\r\n\r\nBut the great, haughty, silent capes themselves; I doubt if any crack\r\npoints, or hills, or historic places of note, or anything of the kind\r\nelsewhere in the world, outvies these objects--(I write while I am\r\nbefore them face to face.) They are very simple, they do not startle--at\r\nleast they did not me--but they linger in one's memory forever. They are\r\nplaced very near each other, side by side, each a mountain rising flush\r\nout of the Saguenay. A good thrower could throw a stone on each in\r\npassing--at least it seems so. Then they are as distinct in form as a\r\nperfect physical man or a perfect physical woman. Cape Eternity is bare,\r\nrising, as just said, sheer out of the water, rugged and grim (yet with\r\nan indescribable beauty) nearly two thousand feet high. Trinity rock,\r\neven a little higher, also rising flush, top-rounded like a great head\r\nwith close-cut verdure of hair. I consider myself well repaid for coming\r\nmy thousand miles to get the sight and memory of the unrivall'd duo.\r\nThey have stirr'd me more profoundly than anything of the kind I have\r\nyet seen. If Europe or Asia had them, we should certainly hear of them\r\nin all sorts of sent-back poems, rhapsodies, &c., a dozen times a year\r\nthrough our papers and magazines.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHICOUTIMI AND HA-HA BAY\r\n\r\nNo indeed--life and travel and memory have offer'd and will preserve to\r\nme no deeper-cut incidents, panorama, or sights to cheer my soul, than\r\nthese at Chicoutimi and Ha-ha bay, and my days and nights up and down\r\nthis fascinating savage river--the rounded mountains, some bare and\r\ngray, some dull red, some draped close all over with matted green\r\nverdure or vines--the ample, calm, eternal rocks everywhere--the long\r\nstreaks of motley foam, a milk-white curd on the glistening breast of\r\nthe stream--the little two-masted schooner, dingy yellow, with patch'd\r\nsails, set wing-and-wing, nearing us, coming saucily up the water with a\r\ncouple of swarthy, black-hair'd men aboard--the strong shades falling on\r\nthe light gray or yellow outlines of the hills all through the forenoon,\r\nas we steam within gunshot of them--while ever the pure and delicate\r\nsky spreads over all. And the splendid sunsets, and the sights of\r\nevening--the same old stars, (relatively a little different, I see, so\r\nfar north) Arcturus and Lyra, and the Eagle, and great Jupiter like\r\na silver globe, and the constellation of the Scorpion. Then northern\r\nlights nearly every night.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INHABITANTS--GOOD LIVING\r\n\r\nGrim and rocky and black-water'd as the demesne hereabout is, however,\r\nyou must not think genial humanity, and comfort, and good-living are not\r\nto be met. Before I began this memorandum I made a first-rate breakfast\r\nof sea-trout, finishing off with wild raspberries. I find smiles and\r\ncourtesy everywhere--physiognomies in general curiously like those in\r\nthe United States--(I was astonish'd to find the same resemblance all\r\nthrough the province of Quebec.) In general the inhabitants of this\r\nrugged country (Charlevoix, Chicoutimi and Tadousac counties, and lake\r\nSt. John region) a simple, hardy population, lumbering, trapping furs,\r\nboating, fishing, berry-picking and a little farming. I was watching a\r\ngroup of young boatmen eating their early dinner--nothing but an immense\r\nloaf of bread, had apparently been the size of a bushel measure, from\r\nwhich they cut chunks with a jack-knife. Must be a tremendous winter\r\ncountry this, when the solid frost and ice fully set in.\r\n\r\n\r\nCEDAR-PLUMS LIKE-NAMES (_Back again in Camden and down in Jersey_)\r\n\r\nOne time I thought of naming this collection \"Cedar-Plums Like\" (which I\r\nstill fancy wouldn't have been a bad name nor inappropriate.) A melange\r\nof loafing, looking, hobbling, sitting, traveling--a little thinking\r\nthrown in for salt, but very little--not only summer but all\r\nseasons--not only days but nights--some literary meditations--books,\r\nauthors examined, Carlyle, Poe, Emerson tried, (always under my\r\ncedar-tree, in the open air, and never in the library)--mostly the\r\nscenes everybody sees, but some of my own caprices, meditations,\r\negotism--truly an open air and mainly summer formation--singly, or in\r\nclusters--wild and free and somewhat acrid--indeed more like cedar-plums\r\nthan you might guess at first glance.\r\n\r\nBut do you know what they are? (To city man, or some sweet parlor lady,\r\nI now talk.) As you go along roads, or barrens, or across country,\r\nanywhere through these States, middle, eastern, western, or southern,\r\nyou will see, certain seasons of the year, the thick woolly tufts of\r\nthe cedar mottled with bunches of china-blue berries, about as big as\r\nfox-grapes. But first a special word for the tree itself: everybody\r\nknows that the cedar is a healthy, cheap, democratic wood, streak'd red\r\nand white--an evergreen--that it is not a _cultivated_ tree--that it\r\nkeeps away moths--that it grows inland or seaboard, all climates, hot\r\nor cold, any soil--in fact rather prefers sand and bleak side\r\nspots--content if the plough, the fertilizer and the trimming-axe, will\r\nbut keep away and let it alone. After a long rain, when everything looks\r\nbright, often have I stopt in my wood-saunters, south or north, or far\r\nwest, to take in its dusky green, wash'd clean and sweet, and speck'd\r\ncopiously with its fruit of clear, hardy blue. The wood of the cedar\r\nis of use--but what profit on earth are those sprigs of acrid plums?\r\nA question impossible to answer satisfactorily. True, some of the herb\r\ndoctors give them for stomachic affections, but the remedy is as bad as\r\nthe disease. Then in my rambles down in Camden county I once found an\r\nold crazy woman gathering the clusters with zeal and joy. She show'd,\r\nas I was told afterward, a sort of infatuation for them, and every year\r\nplaced and kept profuse bunches high and low about her room. They had a\r\nstrange charm on her uneasy head, and effected docility and peace. (She\r\nwas harmless, and lived near by with her well-off married daughter.)\r\nWhether there is any connection between those bunches, and being out of\r\none's wits, I cannot say, but I myself entertain a weakness for them.\r\nIndeed, I love the cedar, anyhow--its naked ruggedness, its just\r\npalpable odor, (so different from the perfumer's best,) its silence,\r\nits equable acceptance of winter's cold and summer's heat, of rain or\r\ndrouth--its shelter to me from those, at times--its associations--(well,\r\nI never could explain _why_ I love anybody, or anything.) The service I\r\nnow specially owe to the cedar is, while I cast around for a name for my\r\nproposed collection, hesitating, puzzled--after rejecting a long, long\r\nstring, I lift my eyes, and lo! the very term I want. At any rate, I go\r\nno further--I tire in the search. I take what some invisible kind spirit\r\nhas put before me. Besides, who shall say there is not affinity enough\r\nbetween (at least the bundle of sticks that produced) many of these\r\npieces, or granulations, and those blue berries? their uselessness\r\ngrowing wild--a certain aroma of Nature I would so like to have in\r\nmy pages--the thin soil whence they come--their content in being let\r\nalone--their stolid and deaf repugnance to answering questions, (this\r\nlatter the nearest, dearest trait affinity of all.)\r\n\r\nThen reader dear, in conclusion, as to the point of the name for the\r\npresent collection, let us be satisfied to _have_ a name--something to\r\nidentify and bind it together, to concrete all its vegetable, mineral,\r\npersonal memoranda, abrupt raids of criticism, crude gossip of\r\nphilosophy, varied sands and clumps--without bothering ourselves because\r\ncertain pages do not present themselves to you or me as coming under\r\ntheir own name with entire fitness or amiability. (It is a profound,\r\nvexatious never-explicable matter--this of names. I have been exercised\r\ndeeply about it my whole life.[11])\r\n\r\nAfter all of which the name \"Cedar-Plums Like\" got its nose put out of\r\njoint; but I cannot afford to throw away what I pencill'd down the\r\nlane there, under the shelter of my old friend, one warm October noon.\r\nBesides, it wouldn't be civil to the cedar tree.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n[11] In the pocket of my receptacle-book I find a list of suggested and\r\nrejected names for this volume, or parts of it--such as the following:\r\n\r\n              _As the wild bee hums in May,\r\n              & August mulleins grow,\r\n              & Winter snow-flakes fall,\r\n              & stars in the sky roll round._\r\n\r\n             _Away from Books--away from Art,\r\n             Now for the Day and Night--the lessons done,\r\n             Now for the Sun and Stars._\r\n\r\n    _Notes of a Half-Paralytic,         As Voices in the Dusk, from\r\n    Week in and Week out,               Speakers far or hid,\r\n    Embers of Ending Days,              Autochthons....Embryons,\r\n    Ducks and Drakes,                   Wing-and-Wing,\r\n    Flood Tide and Ebb,                 Notes and Recalles.\r\n    Gossip at Early Candle-light,       Only Mulleins and Bumble-Bees,\r\n    Echoes and Escapades,               Pond-Babble....Tête-a-Têtes,\r\n    Such as I....Evening Dews,          Echoes of a Life in the 19th\r\n    Notes and Writing a Book,             Century in the New World,\r\n    Far and Near at 63,                 Flanges of Fifty Years,\r\n    Drifts and Cumulus,                 Abandons....Hurry Notes,\r\n    Maize-Tassels....Kindlings,         A Life-Mosaic....Native Moments,\r\n    Fore and Aft....Vestibules,         Types and Semi-Tones,\r\n    Scintilla at 60 and after,          Oddments....Sand-Drifts,\r\n    Sands on the Shores of 64,          Again and Again._\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF THOMAS CARLYLE\r\n\r\n_Feb. 10, '81_.--And so the flame of the lamp, after long wasting and\r\nflickering, has gone out entirely.\r\n\r\nAs a representative author, a literary figure, no man else will bequeath\r\nto the future more significant hints of our stormy era, its fierce\r\nparadoxes, its din, and its struggling parturition periods, than\r\nCarlyle. He belongs to our own branch of the stock too; neither Latin\r\nnor Greek, but altogether Gothic. Rugged, mountainous, volcanic, he\r\nwas himself more a French revolution than any of his volumes. In some\r\nrespects, so far in the Nineteenth century, the best equipt, keenest\r\nmind, even from the college point of view, of all Britain; only he had\r\nan ailing body. Dyspepsia is to be traced in every page, and now and\r\nthen fills the page. One may include among the lessons of his life--even\r\nthough that life stretch'd to amazing length--how behind the tally of\r\ngenius and morals stands the stomach, and gives a sort of casting vote.\r\n\r\nTwo conflicting agonistic elements seem to have contended in the\r\nman, sometimes pulling him different ways like wild horses. He was a\r\ncautious, conservative Scotchman, fully aware what a foetid gas-bag\r\nmuch of modern radicalism is; but then his great heart demanded reform,\r\ndemanded change--often terribly at odds with his scornful brain. No\r\nauthor ever put so much wailing and despair into his books, sometimes\r\npalpable, oftener latent. He reminds me of that passage in Young's poems\r\nwhere as death presses closer and closer for his prey, the soul rushes\r\nhither and thither, appealing, shrieking, berating, to escape the\r\ngeneral doom.\r\n\r\nOf short-comings, even positive blur-spots, from an American point of\r\nview, he had serious share.\r\n\r\nNot for his merely literary merit, (though that was great)--not as\r\n\"maker of books,\" but as launching into the self-complacent atmosphere\r\nof our days a rasping, questioning, dislocating agitation and shock, is\r\nCarlyle's final value. It is time the English-speaking peoples had some\r\ntrue idea about the verteber of genius, namely power. As if they must\r\nalways have it cut and bias'd to the fashion, like a lady's cloak! What\r\na needed service he performs! How he shakes our comfortable reading\r\ncircles with a touch of the old Hebraic anger and prophecy--and indeed\r\nit is just the same. Not Isaiah himself more scornful, more threatening:\r\n\"The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden under\r\nfeet: And the glorious beauty which is on the head of the fat valley\r\nshall be a fading flower.\" (The word prophecy is much misused; it seems\r\nnarrow'd to prediction merely. That is not the main sense of the Hebrew\r\nword translated \"prophet;\" it means one whose mind bubbles up and pours\r\nforth as a fountain, from inner, divine spontaneities revealing God.\r\nPrediction is a very minor part of prophecy. The great matter is to\r\nreveal and outpour the God-like suggestions pressing for birth in the\r\nsoul. This is briefly the doctrine of the Friends or Quakers.)\r\n\r\nThen the simplicity and amid ostensible frailty the towering strength\r\nof this man--a hardy oak knot, you could never wear out--an old\r\nfarmer dress'd in brown clothes, and not handsome--his very foibles\r\nfascinating. Who cares that he wrote about Dr. Francia, and \"Shooting\r\nNiagara\"--and \"the Nigger Question,\"--and didn't at all admire our\r\nUnited States? (I doubt if he ever thought or said half as bad words\r\nabout us as we deserve.) How he splashes like leviathan in the seas of\r\nmodern literature and politics! Doubtless, respecting the latter, one\r\nneeds first to realize, from actual observation, the squalor, vice and\r\ndoggedness ingrain'd in the bulk-population of the British islands, with\r\nthe red tape, the fatuity, the flunkeyism everywhere, to understand the\r\nlast meaning in his pages. Accordingly, though he was no chartist or\r\nradical, I consider Carlyle's by far the most indignant comment or\r\nprotest anent the fruits of feudalism to-day in Great Britain--the\r\nincreasing poverty and degradation of the homeless, landless twenty\r\nmillions, while a few thousands, or rather a few hundreds, possess the\r\nentire soil, the money, and the fat berths. Trade and shipping, and\r\nclubs and culture, and prestige, and guns, and a fine select class of\r\ngentry and aristocracy, with every modern improvement, cannot begin to\r\nsalve or defend such stupendous hoggishness.\r\n\r\nThe way to test how much he has left his country were to consider,\r\nor try to consider, for a moment, the array of British thought, the\r\nresultant _ensemble_ of the last fifty years, as existing to-day, _but\r\nwith Carlyle left out_. It would be like an army with no artillery. The\r\nshow were still a gay and rich one--Byron, Scott, Tennyson, and many\r\nmore--horsemen and rapid infantry, and banners flying--but the last\r\nheavy roar so dear to the ear of the train'd soldier, and that settles\r\nfate and victory, would be lacking.\r\n\r\nFor the last three years we in America have had transmitted glimpses of\r\na thin-bodied, lonesome, wifeless, childless, very old man, lying on\r\na sofa, kept out of bed by indomitable will, but, of late, never well\r\nenough to take the open air. I have noted this news from time to time\r\nin brief descriptions in the papers. A week ago I read such an item just\r\nbefore I started out for my customary evening stroll between eight\r\nand nine. In the fine cold night, unusually clear, (Feb. 5, '81,) as\r\nI walk'd some open grounds adjacent, the condition of Carlyle, and his\r\napproaching--perhaps even then actual--death, filled me with thoughts\r\neluding statement, and curiously blending with the scene. The planet\r\nVenus, an hour high in the west, with all her volume and lustre\r\nrecover'd, (she has been shorn and languid for nearly a year,) including\r\nan additional sentiment I never noticed before--not merely voluptuous,\r\nPaphian, steeping, fascinating--now with calm commanding seriousness and\r\nhauteur--the Milo Venus now. Upward to the zenith, Jupiter, Saturn, and\r\nthe moon past her quarter, trailing in procession, with the Pleiades\r\nfollowing, and the constellation Taurus, and red Aldebaran. Not a cloud\r\nin heaven. Orion strode through the southeast, with his glittering\r\nbelt--and a trifle below hung the sun of the night, Sirius. Every star\r\ndilated, more vitreous, nearer than usual. Not as in some clear nights\r\nwhen the larger stars entirely outshine the rest. Every little star or\r\ncluster just as distinctly visible, and just as nigh. Berenice's hair\r\nshowing every gem, and new ones. To the northeast and north the Sickle,\r\nthe Goat and kids, Cassiopeia, Castor and Pollux, and the two Dippers.\r\nWhile through the whole of this silent indescribable show, inclosing\r\nand bathing my whole receptivity, ran the thought of Carlyle dying. (To\r\nsoothe and spiritualize, and, as far as may be, solve the mysteries of\r\ndeath and genius, consider them under the stars at midnight.)\r\n\r\nAnd now that he has gone hence, can it be that Thomas Carlyle, soon to\r\nchemically dissolve in ashes and by winds, remains an identity still?\r\nIn ways perhaps eluding all the statements, lore and speculations of ten\r\nthousand years--eluding all possible statements to mortal sense--does he\r\nyet exist, a definite, vital being, a spirit, an individual--perhaps\r\nnow wafted in space among those stellar systems, which, suggestive and\r\nlimitless as they are, merely edge more limitless, far more suggestive\r\nsystems? I have no doubt of it. In silence, of a fine night, such\r\nquestions are answer'd to the soul, the best answers that can be given.\r\nWith me, too, when depress'd by some specially sad event, or tearing\r\nproblem, I wait till I go out under the stars for the last voiceless\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARLYLE FROM AMERICAN POINTS OF VIEW\r\n\r\n_Later Thoughts and Jottings_\r\n\r\nThere is surely at present an inexplicable _rapport_ (all the more\r\npiquant from its contradictoriness) between that deceas'd author and our\r\nUnited States of America--no matter whether it lasts or not[13] As we\r\nWesterners assume definite shape, and result in formations and fruitage\r\nunknown before, it is curious with what a new sense our eyes turn to\r\nrepresentative outgrowths of crises and personages in the Old World.\r\nBeyond question, since Carlyle's death, and the publication of Froude's\r\nmemoirs, not only the interest in his books, but every personal bit\r\nregarding the famous Scotchman--his dyspepsia, his buffetings, his\r\nparentage, his paragon of a wife, his career in Edinburgh, in the\r\nlonesome nest on Craigenputtock moor, and then so many years in\r\nLondon--is probably wider and livelier to-day in this country than\r\nin his own land. Whether I succeed or no, I, too, reaching across the\r\nAtlantic and taking the man's dark fortune-telling of humanity and\r\npolitics, would offset it all, (such is the fancy that comes to me,)\r\nby a far more profound horoscope-casting of those themes--G. F.\r\nHegel's.[14]\r\n\r\nFirst, about a chance, a never-fulfill'd vacuity of this pale cast of\r\nthought--this British Hamlet from Cheyne row, more puzzling than the\r\nDanish one, with his contrivances for settling the broken and spavin'd\r\njoints of the world's government, especially its democratic dislocation.\r\nCarlyle's grim fate was cast to live and dwell in, and largely embody,\r\nthe parturition agony and qualms of the old order, amid crowded\r\naccumulations of ghastly morbidity, giving birth to the new.\r\n\r\nBut conceive of him (or his parents before him) coming to America,\r\nrecuperated by the cheering realities and activity of our people and\r\ncountry--growing up and delving face-to-face resolutely among us here,\r\nespecially at the West--inhaling and exhaling our limitless air and\r\neligibilities--devoting his mind to the theories and developments\r\nof this Republic amid its practical facts as exemplified in Kansas,\r\nMissouri, Illinois, Tennessee, or Louisiana. I say _facts_, and\r\nface-to-face confrontings--so different from books, and all those\r\nquiddities and mere reports in the libraries, upon which the man (it\r\nwas wittily said of him at the age of thirty, that there was no one in\r\nScotland who had glean'd so much and seen so little,) almost wholly fed,\r\nand which even his sturdy and vital mind but reflected at best.\r\n\r\nSomething of the sort narrowly escaped happening. In 1835, after more\r\nthan a dozen years of trial and non-success, the author of \"Sartor\r\nResartus\" removing to London, very poor, a confirmed hypochondriac,\r\n\"Sartor\" universally scoffed at, no literary prospects ahead,\r\ndeliberately settled on one last casting throw of the literary\r\ndice--resolv'd to compose and launch forth a book on the subject of\r\n_the French Revolution_--and if that won no higher guerdon or prize than\r\nhitherto, to sternly abandon the trade of author forever, and emigrate\r\nfor good to America. But the venture turn'd out a lucky one, and there\r\nwas no emigration.\r\n\r\nCarlyle's work in the sphere of literature as he commenced and carried\r\nit out, is the same in one or two leading respects that Immanuel\r\nKant's was in speculative philosophy. But the Scotchman had none of the\r\nstomachic phlegm and never-perturb'd placidity of the Konigsberg sage,\r\nand did not, like the latter, understand his own limits, and stop when\r\nhe got to the end of them. He clears away jungle and poisonvines and\r\nunderbrush--at any rate hacks valiantly at them, smiting hip and thigh.\r\nKant did the like in his sphere, and it was all he profess'd to do;\r\nhis labors have left the ground fully prepared ever since--and greater\r\nservice was probably never perform'd by mortal man. But the pang and\r\nhiatus of Carlyle seem to me to consist in the evidence everywhere that\r\namid a whirl of fog and fury and cross-purposes, he firmly believ'd he\r\nhad a clue to the medication of the world's ills, and that his bounden\r\nmission was to exploit it.[15]\r\n\r\nThere were two anchors, or sheet-anchors, for steadying, as a last\r\nresort, the Carlylean ship. One will be specified presently. The other,\r\nperhaps the main, was only to be found in some mark'd form of personal\r\nforce, an extreme degree of competent urge and will, a man or men \"born\r\nto command.\" Probably there ran through every vein and current of the\r\nScotchman's blood something that warm'd up to this kind of trait and\r\ncharacter above aught else in the world, and which makes him in my\r\nopinion the chief celebrater and promulger of it in literature--more\r\nthan Plutarch, more than Shakspere. The great masses of humanity stand\r\nfor nothing--at least nothing but nebulous raw material; only the big\r\nplanets and shining suns for him. To ideas almost invariably languid or\r\ncold, a number-one forceful personality was sure to rouse his eulogistic\r\npassion and savage joy. In such case, even the standard of duty\r\nhereinafter rais'd, was to be instantly lower'd and vail'd. All that\r\nis comprehended under the terms republicanism and democracy were\r\ndistasteful to him from the first, and as he grew older they became\r\nhateful and contemptible. For an undoubtedly candid and penetrating\r\nfaculty such as his, the bearings he persistently ignored were\r\nmarvellous. For instance, the promise, nay certainty of the democratic\r\nprinciple, to each and every State of the current world, not so much\r\nof helping it to perfect legislators and executives, but as the only\r\neffectual method for surely, however slowly, training people on a large\r\nscale toward voluntarily ruling and managing themselves (the ultimate\r\naim of political and all other development)--to gradually reduce the\r\nfact of _governing_ to its minimum, and to subject all its staffs\r\nand their doings to the telescopes and microscopes of committees and\r\nparties--and greatest of all, to afford (not stagnation and obedient\r\ncontent, which went well enough with the feudalism and ecclesiasticism\r\nof the antique and medieval world, but) a vast and sane and recurrent\r\nebb and tide action for those floods of the great deep that have\r\nhenceforth palpably burst forever their old bounds--seem never to have\r\nenter'd Carlyle's thought. It was splendid how he refus'd any compromise\r\nto the last. He was curiously antique. In that harsh, picturesque, most\r\npotent voice and figure, one seems to be carried back from the present\r\nof the British islands more than two thousand years, to the range\r\nbetween Jerusalem and Tarsus. His fullest best biographer justly says of\r\nhim:\r\n\r\nHe was a teacher and a prophet, in the Jewish sense of the word. The\r\nprophecies of Isaiah and Jeremiah have become a part of the permanent\r\nspiritual inheritance of mankind, because events proved that they had\r\ninterpreted correctly the sign of their own times, and their prophecies\r\nwere fulfill'd. Carlyle, like them, believ'd that he had a special\r\nmessage to deliver to the present age. Whether he was correct in that\r\nbelief, and whether his message was a true message, remains to be seen.\r\nHe has told us that our most cherish'd ideas of political liberty, with\r\ntheir kindred corollaries, are mere illusions, and that the progress\r\nwhich has seem'd to go along with them is a progress towards anarchy\r\nand social dissolution. If he was wrong, he has misused his powers. The\r\nprinciples of his teachings are false. He has offer'd himself as a guide\r\nupon a road of which he had no knowledge; and his own desire for himself\r\nwould be the speediest oblivion both of his person and his works. If, on\r\nthe other hand, he has been right; if, like his great predecessors,\r\nhe has read truly the tendencies of this modern age of ours, and his\r\nteaching is authenticated by facts, then Carlyle, too, will take his\r\nplace among the inspired seers.\r\n\r\nTo which I add an amendment that under no circumstances, and no matter\r\nhow completely time and events disprove his lurid vaticinations, should\r\nthe English-speaking world forget this man, nor fail to hold in honor\r\nhis unsurpass'd conscience, his unique method, and his honest fame.\r\nNever were convictions more earnest and genuine. Never was there less\r\nof a flunkey or temporizer. Never had political progressivism a foe it\r\ncould more heartily respect.\r\n\r\nThe second main point of Carlyle's utterance was the idea of _duty being\r\ndone_. (It is simply a new codicil--if it be particularly new, which\r\nis by no means certain--on the time-honor'd bequest of dynasticism,\r\nthe mould-eaten rules of legitimacy and kings.) He seems to have been\r\nimpatient sometimes to madness when reminded by persons who thought\r\nat least as deeply as himself, that this formula, though precious, is\r\nrather a vague one, and that there are many other considerations to a\r\nphilosophical estimate of each and every department either.\r\n\r\nAltogether, I don't know anything more amazing than these persistent\r\nstrides and throbbings so far through our Nineteenth century of\r\nperhaps its biggest, sharpest, and most erudite brain, in defiance\r\nand discontent with everything; contemptuously ignoring, (either from\r\nconstitutional inaptitude, ignorance itself, or more likely because he\r\ndemanded a definite cure-all here and now,) the only solace and solvent\r\nto be had.\r\n\r\nThere is, apart from mere intellect, in the make-up of every superior\r\nhuman identity, (in its moral completeness, considered as _ensemble_,\r\nnot for that moral alone, but for the whole being, including physique,)\r\na wondrous something that realizes without argument, frequently without\r\nwhat is called education, (though I think it the goal and apex of all\r\neducation deserving the name)--an intuition of the absolute balance, in\r\ntime and space, of the whole of this multifarious, mad chaos of fraud,\r\nfrivolity, hoggishness--this revel of fools, and incredible make-believe\r\nand general unsettledness, we call _the world_; a soul-sight of that\r\ndivine clue and unseen thread which holds the whole congeries of\r\nthings, all history and time, and all events, however trivial, however\r\nmomentous, like a leash'd dog in the hand of the hunter. Such soul-sight\r\nand root-centre for the mind--mere optimism explains only the surface\r\nor fringe of it--Carlyle was mostly, perhaps entirely without. He seems\r\ninstead to have been haunted in the play of his mental action by a\r\nspectre, never entirely laid from first to last, (Greek scholars,\r\nI believe, find the same mocking and fantastic apparition attending\r\nAristophanes, his comedies,)--the spectre of world-destruction.\r\n\r\nHow largest triumph or failure in human life, in war or peace, may\r\ndepend on some little hidden centrality, hardly more than a drop of\r\nblood, a pulse-beat, or a breath of air! It is certain that all these\r\nweighty matters, democracy in America, Carlyleism, and the temperament\r\nfor deepest political or literary exploration, turn on a simple point in\r\nspeculative philosophy.\r\n\r\nThe most profound theme that can occupy the mind of man--the problem\r\non whose solution science, art, the bases and pursuits of nations, and\r\neverything else, including intelligent human happiness, (here to-day,\r\n1882, New York, Texas, California, the same as all times, all lands,)\r\nsubtly and finally resting, depends for competent outset and argument,\r\nis doubtless involved in the query: What is the fusing explanation and\r\ntie--what the relation between the (radical, democratic) Me, the human\r\nidentity of understanding, emotions, spirit, &c., on the one side, of\r\nand with the (conservative) Not Me, the whole of the material objective\r\nuniverse and laws, with what is behind them in time and space, on the\r\nother side? Immanuel Kant, though he explain'd or partially explain'd,\r\nas may be said, the laws of the human understanding, left this question\r\nan open one. Schelling's answer, or suggestion of answer, is (and very\r\nvaluable and important, as far as it goes,) that the same general and\r\nparticular intelligence, passion, even the standards of right and wrong,\r\nwhich exist in a conscious and formulated state in man, exist in an\r\nunconscious state, or in perceptible analogies, throughout the entire\r\nuniverse of external Nature, in all its objects large or small, and all\r\nits movements and processes--thus making the impalpable human mind,\r\nand concrete nature, notwithstanding their duality and separation,\r\nconvertible, and in centrality and essence one. But G. F. Hegel's fuller\r\nstatement of the matter probably remains the last best word that has\r\nbeen said upon it, up to date. Substantially adopting the scheme just\r\nepitomized, he so carries it out and fortifies it and merges everything\r\nin it, with certain serious gaps now for the first time fill'd, that it\r\nbecomes a coherent metaphysical system, and substantial answer (as far\r\nas there can be any answer) to the foregoing question--a system which,\r\nwhile I distinctly admit that the brain of the future may add to,\r\nrevise, and even entirely reconstruct, at any rate beams forth\r\nto-day, in its entirety, illuminating the thought of the universe, and\r\nsatisfying the mystery thereof to the human mind, with a more consoling\r\nscientific assurance than any yet.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hegel the whole earth, (an old nucleus-thought, as in the\r\nVedas, and no doubt before, but never hitherto brought so absolutely to\r\nthe front, fully surcharged with modern scientism and facts, and made\r\nthe sole entrance to each and all,) with its infinite variety, the\r\npast, the surroundings of to-day, or what may happen in the future,\r\nthe contrarieties of material with spiritual, and of natural with\r\nartificial, are all, to the eye of the _ensemblist_, but necessary sides\r\nand unfoldings, different steps or links, in the endless process\r\nof Creative thought, which, amid numberless apparent failures and\r\ncontradictions, is held together by central and never-broken unity--not\r\ncontradictions or failures at all, but radiations of one consistent\r\nand eternal purpose; the whole mass of everything steadily, unerringly\r\ntending and flowing toward the permanent _utile_ and _morale_, as rivers\r\nto oceans. As life is the whole law and incessant effort of the visible\r\nuniverse, and death only the other or invisible side of the same, so the\r\n_utile_, so truth, so health are the continuous-immutable laws of the\r\nmoral universe, and vice and disease, with all their perturbations, are\r\nbut transient, even if ever so prevalent expressions.\r\n\r\nTo politics throughout, Hegel applies the like catholic standard and\r\nfaith. Not any one party, or any one form of government, is absolutely\r\nand exclusively true. Truth consists in the just relations of objects to\r\neach other. A majority or democracy may rule as outrageously and do as\r\ngreat harm as an oligarchy or despotism--though far less likely to\r\ndo so. But the great evil is either a violation of the relations just\r\nreferr'd to, or of the moral law. The specious, the unjust, the cruel,\r\nand what is called the unnatural, though not only permitted but in a\r\ncertain sense, (like shade to light,) inevitable in the divine scheme,\r\nare by the whole constitution of that scheme, partial, inconsistent,\r\ntemporary, and though having ever so great an ostensible majority, are\r\ncertainly destin'd to failures, after causing great suffering.\r\n\r\nTheology, Hegel translates into science.[16] All apparent contradictions\r\nin the statement of the Deific nature by different ages, nations,\r\nchurches, points of view, are but fractional and imperfect expressions\r\nof one essential unity, from which they all proceed--crude endeavors or\r\ndistorted parts, to be regarded both as distinct and united. In short\r\n(to put it in our own form, or summing up,) that thinker or analyzer\r\nor overlooker who by an inscrutable combination of train'd wisdom and\r\nnatural intuition most fully accepts in perfect faith the moral unity\r\nand sanity of the creative scheme, in history, science, and all life\r\nand time, present and future, is both the truest cosmical devotee or\r\nreligioso, and the profoundest philosopher. While he who, by the spell\r\nof himself and his circumstance, sees darkness and despair in the sum\r\nof the workings of God's providence, and who, in that, denies or\r\nprevaricates, is, no matter how much piety plays on his lips, the most\r\nradical sinner and infidel.\r\n\r\nI am the more assured in recounting Hegel a little freely here,[17] not\r\nonly for offsetting the Carlylean letter and spirit-cutting it out\r\nall and several from the very roots, and below the roots--but to\r\ncounterpoise, since the late death and deserv'd apotheosis of Darwin,\r\nthe tenets of the evolutionists. Unspeakably precious as those are to\r\nbiology, and henceforth indispensable to a right aim and estimate in\r\nstudy, they neither comprise or explain everything--and the last word or\r\nwhisper still remains to be breathed, after the utmost of those\r\nclaims, floating high and forever above them all, and above technical\r\nmetaphysics. While the contributions which German Kant and Fichte and\r\nSchelling and Hegel have bequeath'd to humanity--and which English\r\nDarwin has also in his field--are indispensable to the erudition of\r\nAmerica's future, I should say that in all of them, and the best of\r\nthem, when compared with the lightning flashes and flights of the old\r\nprophets and _exaltés_, the spiritual poets and poetry of all lands,\r\n(as in the Hebrew Bible,) there seems to be, nay certainly is, something\r\nlacking--something cold, a failure to satisfy the deepest emotions\r\nof the soul--a want of living glow, fondness, warmth, which the old\r\n_exaltés_ and poets supply, and which the keenest modern philosophers so\r\nfar do not.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, and for our purposes, this man's name certainly belongs\r\non the list with the just-specified, first-class moral physicians of\r\nour current era--and with Emerson and two or three others--though\r\nhis prescription is drastic, and perhaps destructive, while theirs is\r\nassimilating, normal and tonic. Feudal at the core, and mental offspring\r\nand radiation of feudalism as are his books, they afford ever-valuable\r\nlessons and affinities to democratic America. Nations or individuals, we\r\nsurely learn deepest from unlikeness, from a sincere opponent, from the\r\nlight thrown even scornfully on dangerous spots and liabilities. (Michel\r\nAngelo invoked heaven's special protection against his friends and\r\naffectionate flatterers; palpable foes he could manage for himself.) In\r\nmany particulars Carlyle was indeed, as Froude terms him, one of those\r\nfar-off Hebraic utterers, a new Micah or Habbakuk. His words at times\r\nbubble forth with abysmic inspiration. Always precious, such men; as\r\nprecious now as any time. His rude, rasping, taunting, contradictory\r\ntones--what ones are more wanted amid the supple, polish'd,\r\nmoney--worshipping, Jesus-and-Judas-equalizing, suffrage-sovereignty\r\nechoes of current America? He has lit up our Nineteenth century with the\r\nlight of a powerful, penetrating, and perfectly honest intellect of\r\nthe first class, turn'd on British and European politics, social life,\r\nliterature, and representative personages--thoroughly dissatisfied with\r\nall, and mercilessly exposing the illness of all. But while he announces\r\nthe malady, and scolds and raves about it, he himself, born and bred in\r\nthe same atmosphere, is a mark'd illustration of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n[13] It will be difficult for the future--judging by his books, personal\r\ndissympathies, &c.,--to account for the deep hold this author has taken\r\non the present age, and the way he has color'd its method and thought.\r\nI am certainly at a loss to account for it all as affecting myself.\r\nBut there could be no view, or even partial picture, of the middle and\r\nlatter part of our Nineteenth century, that did not markedly include\r\nThomas Carlyle. In his case (as so many others, literary productions,\r\nworks of art, personal identities, events,) there has been an impalpable\r\nsomething more effective than the palpable. Then I find no better text,\r\n(it is always important to have a definite, special, even oppositional,\r\nliving man to start from,) for sending out certain speculations\r\nand comparisons for home use. Let us see what they amount to--those\r\nreactionary doctrines, fears, scornful analyses of democracy--even from\r\nthe most erudite and sincere mind of Europe.\r\n\r\n[14] Not the least mentionable part of the case, (a streak, it may\r\nbe, of that humor with which history and fate love to contrast their\r\ngravity,) is that although neither of my great authorities during their\r\nlives consider'd the United States worthy of serious mention, all the\r\nprincipal works of both might not inappropriately be this day collected\r\nand bound up under the conspicuous title: _Speculations for the use of\r\nNorth America, and Democracy there with the relations of the same to\r\nMetaphysics, including Lessons and Warnings (encouragements too, and of\r\nthe vastest,) from the Old World to the New._\r\n\r\n[15] I hope I shall not myself fall into the error I charge upon him, of\r\nprescribing a specific for indispensable evils. My utmost pretension is\r\nprobably but to offset that old claim of the exclusively curative power\r\nof first-class individual men, as leaders and rulers, by the claims,\r\nand general movement and result, of ideas. Something of the latter kind\r\nseems to me the distinctive theory of America, of democracy, and of the\r\nmodern--or rather, I should say, it _is_ democracy, and _is_ the modern.\r\n\r\n[16] I am much indebted to J. Gostick's abstract.\r\n\r\n[17] I have deliberately repeated it all, not only in offset to Carlyle'\r\ns everlurking pessimism and world-decadence, but as presenting the most\r\nthoroughly _American points of view_ I know. In my opinion the above\r\nformulas of Hegel are an essential and crowning justification of New\r\nWorld democracy in the creative realms of time and space. There is that\r\nabout them which only the vastness, the multiplicity and the vitality\r\nof America would seem able to comprehend, to give scope and illustration\r\nto, or to be fit for, or even originate. It is strange to me that they\r\nwere born in Germany, or in the old world at all. While a Carlyle, I\r\nshould say, is quite the legitimate European product to be expected.\r\n\r\n\r\nA COUPLE OF OLD FRIENDS--A COLERIDGE BIT\r\n\r\n_Latter April_.--Have run down in my country haunt for a couple of days,\r\nand am spending them by the pond. I had already discover'd my kingfisher\r\nhere (but only one--the mate not here yet.) This fine bright morning,\r\ndown by the creek, he has come out for a spree, circling, flirting,\r\nchirping at a round rate. While I am writing these lines he is\r\ndisporting himself in scoots and rings over the wider parts of the pond,\r\ninto whose surface he dashes, once or twice making a loud _souse_--the\r\nspray flying in the sun--beautiful! I see his white and dark-gray\r\nplumage and peculiar shape plainly, as he has deign'd to come very near\r\nme. The noble, graceful bird! Now he is sitting on the limb of an old\r\ntree, high up, bending over the water--seems to be looking at me while I\r\nmemorandize. I almost fancy he knows me. _Three days later._--My second\r\nkingfisher is here with his (or her) mate. I saw the two together flying\r\nand whirling around. I had heard, in the distance, what I thought was\r\nthe clear rasping staccato of the birds several times already--but I\r\ncouldn't be sure the notes came from both until I saw them together.\r\nTo-day at noon they appear'd, but apparently either on business, or for\r\na little limited exercise only. No wild frolic now, full of free fun and\r\nmotion, up and down for an hour. Doubtless, now they have cares, duties,\r\nincubation responsibilities. The frolics are deferr'd till summer-close.\r\n\r\nI don't know as I can finish to-day's memorandum better than with\r\nColeridge's lines, curiously appropriate in more ways than one:\r\n\r\n    All Nature seems at work--slugs leave their lair,\r\n    The bees are stirring--birds are on the wing,\r\n    And winter, slumbering in the open air,\r\n    Wears on his smiling face a dream of spring;\r\n    And I, the while, the sole unbusy thing,\r\n    Nor honey make, nor pair, nor build, nor sing.\r\n\r\n\r\nA WEEK'S VISIT TO BOSTON\r\n\r\n_May 1, '81._--Seems as if all the ways and means of American\r\ntravel to-day had been settled, not only with reference to speed and\r\ndirectness, but for the comfort of women, children, invalids, and old\r\nfellows like me. I went on by a through train that runs daily from\r\nWashington to the Yankee metropolis without change. You get in a\r\nsleeping-car soon after dark in Philadelphia, and after ruminating an\r\nhour or two, have your bed made up if you like, draw the curtains,\r\nand go to sleep in it--fly on through Jersey to New York--hear in your\r\nhalf-slumbers a dull jolting and bumping sound or two--are unconsciously\r\ntoted from Jersey City by a midnight steamer around the Battery and\r\nunder the big bridge to the track of the New Haven road--resume your\r\nflight eastward, and early the next morning you wake up in Boston. All\r\nof which was my experience. I wanted to go to the Revere house. A tall\r\nunknown gentleman, (a fellow-passenger on his way to Newport he told\r\nme, I had just chatted a few moments before with him,) assisted me out\r\nthrough the depot crowd, procured a hack, put me in it with my traveling\r\nbag, saying smilingly and quietly, \"Now I want you to let this be _my_\r\nride,\" paid the driver, and before I could remonstrate bow'd himself\r\noff.\r\n\r\nThe occasion of my jaunt, I suppose I had better say here, was for a\r\npublic reading of \"the death of Abraham Lincoln\" essay, on the sixteenth\r\nanniversary of that tragedy; which reading duly came off, night of\r\nApril 15. Then I linger'd a week in Boston--felt pretty well (the mood\r\npropitious, my paralysis lull'd)--went around everywhere, and saw all\r\nthat was to be seen, especially human beings. Boston's immense material\r\ngrowth--commerce, finance, commission stores, the plethora of goods, the\r\ncrowded streets and sidewalks--made of course the first surprising show.\r\nIn my trip out West, last year, I thought the wand of future prosperity,\r\nfuture empire, must soon surely be wielded by St. Louis, Chicago,\r\nbeautiful Denver, perhaps San Francisco; but I see the said wand\r\nstretch'd out just as decidedly in Boston, with just as much certainty\r\nof staying; evidences of copious capital--indeed no centre of the New\r\nWorld ahead of it, (half the big railroads in the West are built with\r\nYankees' money, and they take the dividends.) Old Boston with its zigzag\r\nstreets and multitudinous angles, (crush up a sheet of letter-paper\r\nin your hand, throw it down, stamp it flat, and that is a map of old\r\nBoston)--new Boston with its miles upon miles of large and costly\r\nhouses--Beacon street, Commonwealth avenue, and a hundred others. But\r\nthe best new departures and expansions of Boston, and of all the cities\r\nof New England, are in another direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOSTON OF TO-DAY\r\n\r\nIn the letters we get from Dr. Schliemann (interesting but fishy) about\r\nhis excavations there in the far-off Homeric area, I notice cities,\r\nruins, &c., as he digs them out of their graves, are certain to be in\r\nlayers--that is to say, upon the foundation of an old concern, very\r\nfar down indeed, is always another city or set of ruins, and upon\r\nthat another superadded--and sometimes upon that still another--each\r\nrepresenting either a long or rapid stage of growth and development,\r\ndifferent from its predecessor, but unerringly growing out of and\r\nresting on it. In the moral, emotional, heroic, and human growths, (the\r\nmain of a race in my opinion,) something of this kind has certainly\r\ntaken place in Boston. The New England metropolis of to-day may\r\nbe described as sunny, (there is something else that makes warmth,\r\nmastering even winds and meteorologies, though those are not to be\r\nsneez'd at,) joyous, receptive, full of ardor, sparkle, a certain\r\nelement of yearning, magnificently tolerant, yet not to be fool'd; fond\r\nof good eating and drinking--costly in costume as its purse can buy;\r\nand all through its best average of houses, streets, people, that\r\nsubtle something (generally thought to be climate, but it is not--it is\r\nsomething indefinable in the _race_, the turn of its development) which\r\neffuses behind the whirl of animation, study, business, a happy and\r\njoyous public spirit, as distinguish'd from a sluggish and saturnine\r\none. Makes me think of the glints we get (as in Symonds's books) of the\r\njolly old Greek cities. Indeed there is a good deal of the Hellenic in\r\nB., and the people are getting handsomer too--padded out, with freer\r\nmotions, and with color in their faces. I never saw (although this is\r\nnot Greek) so many _fine-looking gray-hair'd women_. At my lecture\r\nI caught myself pausing more than once to look at them, plentiful\r\neverywhere through the audience--healthy and wifely and motherly, and\r\nwonderfully charming and beautiful--I think such as no time or land but\r\nours could show.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY TRIBUTE TO FOUR POETS\r\n\r\n_April 16_.--A short but pleasant visit to Longfellow. I am not one\r\nof the calling kind, but as the author of \"Evangeline\" kindly took the\r\ntrouble to come and see me three years ago in Camden, where I was ill,\r\nI felt not only the impulse of my own pleasure on that occasion, but a\r\nduty. He was the only particular eminence I called on in Boston, and I\r\nshall not soon forget his lit-up face and glowing warmth and courtesy,\r\nin the modes of what is called the old school.\r\n\r\nAnd now just here I feel the impulse to interpolate something about the\r\nmighty four who stamp this first American century with its birthmarks of\r\npoetic literature. In a late magazine one of my reviewers, who ought\r\nto know better, speaks of my \"attitude of contempt and scorn and\r\nintolerance\" toward the leading poets--of my \"deriding\" them, and\r\npreaching their \"uselessness.\" If anybody cares to know what I\r\nthink--and have long thought and avow'd--about them, I am entirely\r\nwilling to propound. I can't imagine any better luck befalling these\r\nStates for a poetical beginning and initiation than has come from\r\nEmerson, Longfellow, Bryant, and Whittier. Emerson, to me, stands\r\nunmistakably at the head, but for the others I am at a loss where to\r\ngive any precedence. Each illustrious, each rounded, each distinctive.\r\nEmerson for his sweet, vital-tasting melody, rhym'd philosophy, and\r\npoems as amber-clear as the honey of the wild bee he loves to sing.\r\nLongfellow for rich color, graceful forms and incidents--all that makes\r\nlife beautiful and love refined--competing with the singers of Europe\r\non their own ground, and, with one exception, better and finer work than\r\nthat of any of them. Bryant pulsing the first interior verse-throbs of a\r\nmighty world--bard of the river and the wood, ever conveying a taste of\r\nopen air, with scents as from hayfields, grapes, birch-borders--always\r\nlurkingly fond of threnodies--beginning and ending his long career with\r\nchants of death, with here and there through all, poems, or passages\r\nof poems, touching the highest universal truths, enthusiasms,\r\nduties--morals as grim and eternal, if not as stormy and fateful, as\r\nanything in Eschylus. While in Whittier, with his special themes--(his\r\noutcropping love of heroism and war, for all his Quakerdom, his verses\r\nat times like the measur'd step of Cromwell's old veterans)--in Whittier\r\nlives the zeal, the moral energy, that founded New England--the splendid\r\nrectitude and ardor of Luther, Milton, George Fox--I must not, dare not,\r\nsay the wilfulness and narrowness--though doubtless the world needs\r\nnow, and always will need, almost above all, just such narrowness and\r\nwilfulness.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILLET'S PICTURES LAST ITEMS\r\n\r\n_April 18_.--Went out three or four miles to the house of Quincy Shaw,\r\nto see a collection of J. F. Millet's pictures. Two rapt hours. Never\r\nbefore have I been so penetrated by this kind of expression. I stood\r\nlong and long before \"the Sower.\" I believe what the picture-men\r\ndesignate \"the first Sower,\" as the artist executed a second copy, and\r\na third, and, some think, improved in each. But I doubt it. There is\r\nsomething in this that could hardly be caught again--a sublime murkiness\r\nand original pent fury. Besides this masterpiece, there were many\r\nothers, (I shall never forget the simple evening scene, \"Watering the\r\nCow,\") all inimitable, all perfect as pictures, works of mere art; and\r\nthen it seem'd to me, with that last impalpable ethic purpose from the\r\nartist (most likely unconscious to himself) which I am always looking\r\nfor. To me all of them told the full story of what went before and\r\nnecessitated the great French revolution--the long precedent crushing\r\nof the masses of a heroic people into the earth, in abject poverty,\r\nhunger--every right denied, humanity attempted to be put back for\r\ngenerations--yet Nature's force, titanic here, the stronger and hardier\r\nfor that repression--waiting terribly to break forth, revengeful--the\r\npressure on the dykes, and the bursting at last--the storming of the\r\nBastile--the execution of the king and queen--the tempest of massacres\r\nand blood. Yet who can wonder?\r\n\r\n    Could we wish humanity different?\r\n    Could we wish the people made of wood or stone?\r\n    Or that there be no justice in destiny or time?\r\n\r\nThe true France, base of all the rest, is certainly in these pictures. I\r\ncomprehend \"Field-People Reposing,\" \"the Diggers,\" and \"the Angelus\"\r\nin this opinion. Some folks always think of the French as a small race,\r\nfive or five and a half feet high, and ever frivolous and smirking.\r\nNothing of the sort. The bulk of the personnel of France, before the\r\nrevolution, was large-sized, serious, industrious as now, and simple.\r\nThe revolution and Napoleon's wars dwarf'd the standard of human size,\r\nbut it will come up again. If for nothing else, I should dwell on my\r\nbrief Boston visit for opening to me the new world of Millet's pictures.\r\nWill America ever have such an artist out of her own gestation, body,\r\nsoul?\r\n\r\n_Sunday, April 17._--An hour and a half, late this afternoon, in silence\r\nand half light, in the great nave of Memorial hall, Cambridge, the walls\r\nthickly cover'd with mural tablets, bearing the names of students and\r\ngraduates of the university who fell in the secession war.\r\n\r\n_April 23._--It was well I got away in fair order, for if I had staid\r\nanother week I should have been killed with kindness, and with eating\r\nand drinking.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRDS--AND A CAUTION\r\n\r\n_May 14._--Home again; down temporarily in the Jersey woods. Between 8\r\nand 9 A.M. a full concert of birds, from different quarters, in keeping\r\nwith the fresh scent, the peace, the naturalness all around me. I am\r\nlately noticing the russet-back, size of the robin or a trifle less,\r\nlight breast and shoulders, with irregular dark stripes--tail long--sits\r\nhunch'd up by the hour these days, top of a tall bush, or some tree,\r\nsinging blithely. I often get near and listen, as he seems tame; I like\r\nto watch the working of his bill and throat, the quaint sidle of his\r\nbody, and flex of his long tail. I hear the woodpecker, and night and\r\nearly morning the shuttle of the whip-poor-will--noons, the gurgle of\r\nthrush delicious, and _meo-o-ow_ of the cat-bird. Many I cannot name;\r\nbut I do not very particularly seek information. (You must not know too\r\nmuch, or be too precise or scientific about birds and trees and flowers\r\nand water-craft; a certain free margin, and even vagueness--perhaps\r\nignorance, credulity--helps your enjoyment of these things, and of the\r\nsentiment of feather'd, wooded, river, or marine Nature generally. I\r\nrepeat it--don't want to know too exactly, or the reasons why. My own\r\nnotes have been written off-hand in the latitude of middle New Jersey.\r\nThough they describe what I saw--what appear'd to me--I dare say the\r\nexpert ornithologist, botanist or entomologist will detect more than one\r\nslip in them.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMPLES OF MY COMMON-PLACE BOOK\r\n\r\nI ought not to offer a record of these days, interests, recuperations,\r\nwithout including a certain old, well-thumb'd common-place book,[18]\r\nfilled with favorite excerpts, I carried in my pocket for three summers,\r\nand absorb'd over and over again, when the mood invited. I find so much\r\nin having a poem or fine suggestion sink into me (a little then goes a\r\ngreat ways) prepar'd by these vacant-sane and natural influences.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n[18] _Samples of my common-place book down at the creek:_\r\n\r\nI have--says old Pindar--many swift arrows in my quiver which speak to\r\nthe wise, though they need an interpreter to the thoughtless. Such a man\r\nas it takes ages to make, and ages to understand. _H. D. Thoreau._\r\n\r\nIf you hate a man, don't kill him, but let him live.--_Buddhistic._\r\nFamous swords are made of refuse scraps, thought worthless.\r\n\r\nPoetry is the only verity--the expression of a sound mind speaking after\r\nthe ideal--and not after the apparent.--_Emerson_.\r\n\r\nThe form of oath among the Shoshone Indians is, \"The earth hears me.

Shall I lie?\"\r\n\r\nThe true test of civilization is not the census, nor the size of\r\ncities, nor the crops--no, but the kind of a man the country turns\r\nout.--_Emerson_.\r\n\r\n    The whole wide ether is the eagle's sway:\r\n    The whole earth is a brave man's fatherland.--_Euripides_.\r\n\r\n    Spices crush'd, their pungence yield,\r\n      Trodden scents their sweets respire;\r\n    Would you have its strength reveal'd?\r\n      Cast the incense in the fire.\r\n\r\nMatthew Arnold speaks of \"the huge Mississippi of falsehood called\r\nHistory.\"\r\n\r\n    The wind blows north, the wind blows south,\r\n        The wind blows east and west;\r\n    No matter how the free wind blows,\r\n         Some ship will find it best.\r\n\r\nPreach not to others what they should eat, but eat as becomes you, and\r\nbe silent.--_Epictetus_.\r\n\r\nVictor Hugo makes a donkey meditate and apostrophize thus:\r\n\r\n    My brother, man, if you would know the truth,\r\n    We both are by the same dull walls shut in;\r\n    The gate is massive and the dungeon strong.\r\n    But you look through the key-hole out beyond,\r\n    And call this knowledge; yet have not at hand\r\n    The key wherein to turn the fatal lock.\r\n\r\n\"William Cullen Bryant surprised me once,\" relates a writer in a\r\nNew York paper, \"by saying that prose was the natural language of\r\ncomposition, and he wonder'd how anybody came to write poetry.\"\r\n\r\n    Farewell! I did not know thy worth;\r\n        But thou art gone, and now 'tis prized:\r\n    So angels walk'd unknown on earth,\r\n        But when they flew were recognized.--_Hood_.\r\n\r\nJohn Burroughs, writing of Thoreau, says: \"He improves with age--in fact\r\nrequires age to take off a little of his asperity, and fully ripen him.\r\nThe world likes a good hater and refuser almost as well as it likes a\r\ngood lover and accepter--only it likes him farther off.\"\r\n\r\n_Louise Michel at the burial of Blanqui, (1881.)_\r\n\r\nBlanqui drill'd his body to subjection to his grand conscience and his\r\nnoble passions, and commencing as a young man, broke with all that is\r\nsybaritish in modern civilization. Without the power to sacrifice self,\r\ngreat ideas will never bear fruit.\r\n\r\n    Out of the leaping furnace flame\r\n    A mass of molten silver came;\r\n    Then, beaten into pieces three,\r\n    Went forth to meet its destiny.\r\n    The first a crucifix was made,\r\n    Within a soldier's knapsack laid;\r\n    The second was a locket fair,\r\n    Where a mother kept her dead child's hair;\r\n    The third--a bangle, bright and warm,\r\n    Around a faithless woman's arm.\r\n\r\n    A mighty pain to love it is,\r\n    And'tis a pain that pain to miss;\r\n    But of all pain the greatest pain,\r\n    It is to love, but love in vain.\r\n\r\n_Maurice F. Egan on De Guerin._\r\n\r\n    A pagan heart, a Christian soul had he,\r\n      He followed Christ, yet for dead Pan he sigh'd,\r\n      Till earth and heaven met within his breast:\r\n    As if Theocritus in Sicily\r\n      Had come upon the Figure crucified,\r\n      And lost his gods in deep, Christ-given rest.\r\n\r\n    And if I pray, the only prayer\r\n      That moves my lips for me,\r\n    Is, leave the mind that now I bear,\r\n      And give me Liberty.--_Emily Bronte._\r\n\r\n    I travel on not knowing,\r\n      I would not if I might;\r\n    I would rather walk with God in the dark,\r\n      Than go alone in the light;\r\n    I would rather walk with Him by faith\r\n      Than pick my way by sight\r\n\r\n\r\nMY NATIVE SAND AND SALT ONCE MORE\r\n\r\n_July 25, '81.--Far Rockaway, L. I._--A good day here, on a jaunt,\r\namid the sand and salt, a steady breeze setting in from the sea, the sun\r\nshining, the sedge-odor, the noise of the surf, a mixture of hissing and\r\nbooming, the milk-white crest curling. I had a leisurely bath and naked\r\nramble as of old, on the warm-gray shore-sands, my companions off in a\r\noat in deeper water--(I shouting to them Jupiter's menaces against the\r\ngods, from Pope's Homer) _July 28--to Long Branch_--8-1/2 A.M., on the\r\nsteamer \"Plymouth Rock,\" foot of 23d street, New York, for Long\r\nBranch. Another fine day, fine sights, the shores, the shipping and\r\nbay--everything comforting to the body and spirit of me. (I find the\r\nhuman and objective atmosphere of New York city and Brooklyn more\r\naffiliative to me than any other.) _An hour later_--Still on the\r\nsteamer, now sniffing the salt very plainly--the long pulsating _swash_\r\nas our boat steams seaward--the hills of Navesink and many passing\r\nvessels--the air the best part of all. At Long Branch the bulk of the\r\nday, stopt at a good hotel, took all very leisurely, had an excellent\r\ndinner, and then drove for over two hours about the place, especially\r\nOcean avenue, the finest drive one can imagine, seven or eight miles\r\nright along the beach. In all directions costly villas, palaces,\r\nmillionaires--(but few among them I opine like my friend George W.\r\nChilds, whose personal integrity, generosity, unaffected simplicity, go\r\nbeyond all worldly wealth.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHOT WEATHER NEW YORK\r\n\r\n_August_.--In the big city awhile. Even the height of the dog-days,\r\nthere is a good deal of fun about New York, if you only avoid fluster,\r\nand take all the buoyant wholesomeness that offers. More comfort, too,\r\nthan most folks think. A middle-aged man, with plenty of money in his\r\npocket, tells me that he has been off for a month to all the swell\r\nplaces, has disburs'd a small fortune, has been hot and out of kilter\r\neverywhere, and has return' d home and lived in New York city the last\r\ntwo weeks quite contented and happy. People forget when it is hot here,\r\nit is generally hotter still in other places.\r\n\r\nNew York is so situated, with the great ozonic brine on both sides, it\r\ncomprises the most favorable health-chances in the world. (If only the\r\nsuffocating crowding of some of its tenement houses could be broken\r\nup.) I find I never sufficiently realized how beautiful are the upper\r\ntwo-thirds of Manhattan island. I am stopping at Mott Haven, and have\r\nbeen familiar now for ten days with the region above One-hundredth\r\nstreet, and along the Harlem river and Washington heights. Am dwelling a\r\nfew days with my friends Mr. and Mrs. J. H. J., and a merry houseful of\r\nyoung ladies. Am putting the last touches on the printer's copy of my\r\nnew volume of \"Leaves of Grass\"--the completed book at last. Work at it\r\ntwo or three hours, and then go down and loaf along the Harlem river;\r\nhave just had a good spell of this recreation. The sun sufficiently\r\nveil'd, a soft south breeze, the river full of small or large shells\r\n(light taper boats) darting up and down, some singly, now and then\r\nlong ones with six or eight young fellows practicing--very inspiriting\r\nsights. Two fine yachts lie anchor'd off the shore. I linger long,\r\nenjoying the sundown, the glow, the streak'd sky, the heights,\r\ndistances, shadows. _Aug. 10._--As I haltingly ramble an hour or two\r\nthis forenoon by the more secluded parts of the shore, or sit under\r\nan old cedar half way up the hill, the city near in view, many young\r\nparties gather to bathe or swim, squads of boys, generally twos or\r\nthrees, some larger ones, along the sand-bottom, or off an old pier\r\nclose by. A peculiar and pretty carnival--at its height a hundred lads\r\nor young men, very democratic, but all decent behaving. The laughter,\r\nvoices, calls, re-responses--the springing and diving of the bathers\r\nfrom the great string-piece of the decay'd pier, where climb or stand\r\nlong ranks of them, naked, rose-color'd, with movements, postures ahead\r\nof any sculpture. To all this, the sun, so bright, the dark-green shadow\r\nof the hills the other side, the amber-rolling waves, changing as the\r\ntide comes in to a trans-parent tea-color--the frequent splash of the\r\nplayful boys, sousing--the glittering drops sparkling, and the good\r\nwestern breeze blowing.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUSTER'S LAST RALLY\r\n\r\nWent to-day to see this just-finish'd painting by John Mulvany, who\r\nhas been out in far Dakota, on the spot, at the forts, and among the\r\nfrontiersmen, soldiers and Indians, for the last two years, on purpose\r\nto sketch it in from reality, or the best that could be got of it. Sat\r\nfor over an hour before the picture, completely absorb'd in the first\r\nview. A vast canvas, I should say twenty or twenty-two feet by twelve,\r\nall crowded, and yet not crowded, conveying such a vivid play of color,\r\nit takes a little time to get used to it. There are no tricks; there\r\nis no throwing of shades in masses; it is all at first painfully real,\r\noverwhelming, needs good nerves to look at it. Forty or fifty figures,\r\nperhaps more, in full finish and detail in the mid-ground, with three\r\ntimes that number, or more, through the rest--swarms upon swarms of\r\nsavage Sioux, in their war-bonnets, frantic, mostly on ponies, driving\r\nthrough the background, through the smoke, like a hurricane of demons.\r\nA dozen of the figures are wonderful. Altogether a western, autochthonic\r\nphase of America, the frontiers, culminating, typical, deadly, heroic to\r\nthe uttermost--nothing in the books like it, nothing in Homer, nothing\r\nin Shakspere; more grim and sublime than either, all native, all our\r\nown, and all a fact. A great lot of muscular, tan-faced men, brought\r\nto bay under terrible circumstances--death ahold of them, yet every man\r\nundaunted, not one losing his head, wringing out every cent of the pay\r\nbefore they sell their lives. Custer (his hair cut short stands in\r\nthe middle), with dilated eye and extended arm, aiming a huge cavalry\r\npistol. Captain Cook is there, partially wounded, blood on the\r\nwhite handkerchief around his head, aiming his carbine coolly, half\r\nkneeling--(his body was afterwards found close by Custer's.) The\r\nslaughter'd or half-slaughter'd horses, for breastworks, make a peculiar\r\nfeature. Two dead Indians, herculean, lie in the foreground, clutching\r\ntheir Winchester rifles, very characteristic. The many soldiers, their\r\nfaces and attitudes, the carbines, the broad-brimm'd western hats, the\r\npowder-smoke in puffs, the dying horses with their rolling eyes\r\nalmost human in their agony, the clouds of war-bonneted Sioux in the\r\nbackground, the figures of Custer and Cook--with indeed the whole scene,\r\ndreadful, yet with an attraction and beauty that will remain in my\r\nmemory. With all its color and fierce action, a certain Greek continence\r\npervades it. A sunny sky and clear light envelop all. There is an\r\nalmost entire absence of the stock traits of European war pictures. The\r\nphysiognomy of the work is realistic and Western. I only saw it for an\r\nhour or so; but it needs to be seen many times--needs to be studied over\r\nand over again. I could look on such a work at brief intervals all\r\nmy life without tiring; it is very tonic to me; then it has an ethic\r\npurpose below all, as all great art must have. The artist said the\r\nsending of the picture abroad, probably to London, had been talk'd of.\r\nI advised him if it went abroad to take it to Paris. I think they might\r\nappreciate it there--nay, they certainly would. Then I would like to\r\nshow Messieur Crapeau that some things can be done in America as well as\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME OLD ACQUAINTANCES--MEMORIES\r\n\r\n_Aug. 16._--\"Chalk a big mark for today,\" was one of the sayings of an\r\nold sportsman-friend of mine, when he had had unusually good luck--come\r\nhome thoroughly tired, but with satisfactory results of fish or birds.\r\n\r\nWell, to-day might warrant such a mark for me. Everything propitious\r\nfrom the start. An hour's fresh stimulation, coming down ten miles of\r\nManhattan island by railroad and 8 o'clock stage. Then an excellent\r\nbreakfast at Pfaff's restaurant, 24th street. Our host himself, an old\r\nfriend of mine, quickly appear'd on the scene to welcome me and bring\r\nup the news, and, first opening a big fat bottle of the best wine in\r\nthe cellar, talk about ante-bellum times, '59 and '60, and the jovial\r\nsuppers at his then Broadway place, near Bleecker street. Ah, the\r\nfriends and names and frequenters, those times, that place. Most are\r\ndead--Ada Clare, Wilkins, Daisy Sheppard, O'Brien, Henry Clapp, Stanley,\r\nMullin, Wood, Brougham, Arnold--all gone. And there Pfaff and I, sitting\r\nopposite each other at the little table, gave a remembrance to them in a\r\nstyle they would have themselves fully confirm'd, namely, big, brimming,\r\nfill'd-up champagne-glasses, drain'd in abstracted silence, very\r\nleisurely, to the last drop. (Pfaff is a generous German _restaurateur_,\r\nsilent, stout, jolly, and I should say the best selecter of champagne in\r\nAmerica.)\r\n\r\n\r\nA DISCOVERY OF OLD AGE\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best is always cumulative. One's eating and drinking one\r\nwants fresh, and for the nonce, right off, and have done with it--but I\r\nwould not give a straw for that person or poem, or friend, or city,\r\nor work of art, that was not more grateful the second time than the\r\nfirst--and more still the third. Nay, I do not believe any grandest\r\neligibility ever comes forth at first. In my own experience, (persons,\r\npoems, places, characters,) I discover the best hardly ever at first,\r\n(no absolute rule about it, however,) sometimes suddenly bursting\r\nforth, or stealthily opening to me, perhaps after years of unwitting\r\nfamiliarity, unappreciation, usage.\r\n\r\n\r\nA VISIT, AT THE LAST, TO R. W. EMERSON\r\n\r\n_Concord, Mass._--Out here on a visit--elastic, mellow, Indian-summery\r\nweather. Came to-day from Boston, (a pleasant ride of 40 minutes by\r\nsteam, through Somerville, Belmont, Waltham, Stony Brook, and other\r\nlively towns,) convoy'd by my friend F. B. Sanborn, and to his ample\r\nhouse, and the kindness and hospitality of Mrs. S. and their fine\r\nfamily. Am writing this under the shade of some old hickories and elms,\r\njust after 4 P.M., on the porch, within a stone's throw of the Concord\r\nriver. Off against me, across stream, on a meadow and side-hill,\r\nhaymakers are gathering and wagoning-in probably their second or third\r\ncrop. The spread of emerald-green and brown, the knolls, the score or\r\ntwo of little haycocks dotting the meadow, the loaded-up wagons, the\r\npatient horses, the slow-strong action of the men and pitchforks--all in\r\nthe just-waning afternoon, with patches of yellow sun-sheen, mottled\r\nby long shadows--a cricket shrilly chirping, herald of the dusk--a boat\r\nwith two figures noiselessly gliding along the little river, passing\r\nunder the stone bridge-arch--the slight settling haze of aerial\r\nmoisture, the sky and the peacefulness expanding in all directions and\r\noverhead--fill and soothe me.\r\n\r\n_Same Evening._--Never had I a better piece of luck befall me: a long\r\nand blessed evening with Emerson, in a way I couldn't have wish'd better\r\nor different. For nearly two hours he has been placidly sitting where\r\nI could see his face in the best light, near me. Mrs. S.'s back-parlor\r\nwell fill'd with people, neighbors, many fresh and charming faces,\r\nwomen, mostly young, but some old. My friend A. B. Alcott and his\r\ndaughter Louisa were there early. A good deal of talk, the subject Henry\r\nThoreau--some new glints of his life and fortunes, with letters to and\r\nfrom him--one of the best by Margaret Fuller, others by Horace Greeley,\r\nChanning, &c.--one from Thoreau himself, most quaint and interesting.\r\n(No doubt I seem'd very stupid to the roomful of company, taking hardly\r\nany part in the conversation; but I had \"my own pail to milk in,\" as the\r\nSwiss proverb puts it.) My seat and the relative arrangement were such\r\nthat, without being rude, or anything of the kind, I could just look\r\nsquarely at E., which I did a good part of the two hours. On entering,\r\nhe had spoken very briefly and politely to several of the company,\r\nthen settled himself in his chair, a trifle push'd back, and, though a\r\nlistener and apparently an alert one, remain'd silent through the whole\r\ntalk and discussion. A lady friend quietly took a seat next him, to\r\ngive special attention. A good color in his face, eyes clear, with the\r\nwell-known expression of sweetness, and the old clear-peering aspect\r\nquite the same.\r\n\r\n_Next Day_.--Several hours at E.'s house, and dinner there. An\r\nold familiar house, (he has been in it thirty-five years,) with\r\nsurroundings, furnishment, roominess, and plain elegance and fullness,\r\nsignifying democratic ease, sufficient opulence, and an admirable\r\nold-fashioned simplicity--modern luxury, with its mere sumptuousness and\r\naffectation, either touch'd lightly upon or ignored altogether. Dinner\r\nthe same. Of course the best of the occasion (Sunday, September 18,\r\n'81) was the sight of E. himself. As just said, a healthy color in the\r\ncheeks, and good light in the eyes, cheery expression, and just the\r\namount of talking that best suited, namely, a word or short phrase only\r\nwhere needed, and almost always with a smile. Besides Emerson himself,\r\nMrs. E., with their daughter Ellen, the son Edward and his wife, with\r\nmy friend F. S. and Mrs. S., and others, relatives and intimates. Mrs.\r\nEmerson, resuming the subject of the evening before, (I sat next to\r\nher,) gave me further and fuller information about Thoreau, who, years\r\nago, during Mr. E.'s absence in Europe, had lived for some time in the\r\nfamily, by invitation.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER CONCORD NOTATIONS\r\n\r\nThough the evening at Mr. and Mrs. Sanborn's, and the memorable family\r\ndinner at Mr. and Mrs. Emerson's, have most pleasantly and permanently\r\nfill'd my memory, I must not slight other notations of Concord. I went\r\nto the old Manse, walk'd through the ancient garden, enter'd the rooms,\r\nnoted the quaintness, the unkempt grass and bushes, the little panes in\r\nthe windows, the low ceilings, the spicy smell, the creepers embowering\r\nthe light. Went to the Concord battle ground, which is close by, scann'd\r\nFrench's statue, \"the Minute Man,\" read Emerson's poetic inscription on\r\nthe base, linger'd a long while on the bridge, and stopp'd by the grave\r\nof the unnamed British soldiers buried there the day after the fight\r\nin April, '75. Then riding on, (thanks to my friend Miss M. and her\r\nspirited white ponies, she driving them,) a half hour at Hawthorne's and\r\nThoreau's graves. I got out and went up of course on foot, and stood a\r\nlong while and ponder'd. They lie close together in a pleasant wooded\r\nspot well up the cemetery hill, \"Sleepy Hollow.\" The flat surface of the\r\nfirst was densely cover'd by myrtle, with a border of arbor-vitae,\r\nand the other had a brown headstone, moderately elaborate, with\r\ninscriptions. By Henry's side lies his brother John, of whom much\r\nwas expected, but he died young. Then to Walden pond, that beautiful\r\nembower'd sheet of water, and spent over an hour there. On the spot in\r\nthe woods where Thoreau had his solitary house is now quite a cairn of\r\nstones, to mark the place; I too carried one and deposited on the heap.\r\nAs we drove back, saw the \"School of Philosophy,\" but it was shut up,\r\nand I would not have it open'd for me. Near by stopp'd at the house\r\nof W.T. Harris, the Hegelian, who came out, and we had a pleasant chat\r\nwhile I sat in the wagon. I shall not soon forget those Concord drives,\r\nand especially that charming Sunday forenoon one with my friend Miss M.,\r\nand the white ponies.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOSTON COMMON--MORE OF EMERSON\r\n\r\n_Oct. 10-13._--I spend a good deal of time on the Common, these\r\ndelicious days and nights--every mid-day from 11.30 to about 1--and\r\nalmost every sunset another hour. I know all the big trees, especially\r\nthe old elms along Tremont and Beacon streets, and have come to a\r\nsociable silent understanding with most of them, in the sunlit air, (yet\r\ncrispy-cool enough,) as I saunter along the wide unpaved walks. Up\r\nand down this breadth by Beacon street, between these same old elms,\r\nI walk'd for two hours, of a bright sharp February mid-day twenty-one\r\nyears ago, with Emerson, then in his prime, keen, physically and\r\nmorally magnetic, arm'd at every point, and when he chose, wielding the\r\nemotional just as well as the intellectual. During those two hours\r\nhe was the talker and I the listener. It was an argument-statement,\r\nreconnoitring, review, attack, and pressing home, (like an army corps in\r\norder, artillery, cavalry, infantry,) of all that could be said against\r\nthat part (and a main part) in the construction of my poems, \"Children\r\nof Adam.\" More precious than gold to me that dissertion--it afforded\r\nme, ever after, this strange and paradoxical lesson; each point of E.'s\r\nstatement was unanswerable, no judge's charge ever more complete or\r\nconvincing, I could never hear the points better put--and then I felt\r\ndown in my soul the clear and unmistakable conviction to disobey all,\r\nand pursue my own way. \"What have you to say then to such things?\" said\r\nE., pausing in conclusion. \"Only that while I can't answer them at all,\r\nI feel more settled than ever to adhere to my own theory, and exemplify\r\nit,\" was my candid response. Whereupon we went and had a good dinner\r\nat the American House. And thenceforward I never waver'd or was touch'd\r\nwith qualms, (as I confess I had been two or three times before.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAN OSSIANIC NIGHT--DEAREST FRIENDS\r\n\r\n_Nov., '81_.--Again back in Camden. As I cross the Delaware in long trips\r\ntonight, between 9 and 11, the scene overhead is a peculiar one--swift\r\nsheets of flitting vapor-gauze, follow'd by dense clouds throwing an\r\ninky pall on everything. Then a spell of that transparent steel-gray\r\nblack sky I have noticed under similar circumstances, on which the moon\r\nwould beam for a few moments with calm lustre, throwing down a broad\r\ndazzle of highway on the waters; then the mists careering again. All\r\nsilently, yet driven as if by the furies they sweep along, sometimes\r\nquite thin, sometimes thicker--a real Ossianic night--amid the\r\nwhirl, absent or dead friends, the old, the past, somehow tenderly\r\nsuggested--while the Gael-strains chant themselves from the mists--\"Be\r\nthy soul blest, O Carril! in the midst of thy eddying winds. O that thou\r\nwouldst come to my hall when I am alone by night! And thou dost come,\r\nmy friend. I hear often thy light hand on my harp, when it hangs on the\r\ndistant wall, and the feeble sound touches my ear. Why dost thou not\r\nspeak to me in my grief, and tell me when I shall behold my friends? But\r\nthou passest away in thy murmuring blast; the wind whistles through the\r\ngray hairs of Ossian.\"\r\n\r\nBut most of all, those changes of moon and sheets of hurrying vapor and\r\nblack clouds, with the sense of rapid action in weird silence, recall\r\nthe far-back Erse belief that such above were the preparations for\r\nreceiving the wraiths of just-slain warriors--[\"We sat that night in\r\nSelma, round the strength of the shell. The wind was abroad in the oaks.\r\nThe spirit of the mountain roar'd. The blast came rustling through the\r\nhall, and gently touch'd my harp. The sound was mournful and low, like\r\nthe song of the tomb. Fingal heard it the first. The crowded sighs of\r\nhis bosom rose. Some of my heroes are low, said the gray-hair'd king\r\nof Morven. I hear the sound of death on the harp. Ossian, touch the\r\ntrembling string. Bid the sorrow rise, that their spirits may fly with\r\njoy to Morven's woody hills. I touch'd the harp before the king; the\r\nsound was mournful and low. Bend forward from your clouds, I said,\r\nghosts of my fathers! bend. Lay by the red terror of your course.\r\nReceive the falling chief; whether he comes from a distant land, or\r\nrises from the rolling sea. Let his robe of mist be near; his spear that\r\nis form'd of a cloud. Place a half-extinguish'd meteor by his side, in\r\nthe form of a hero's sword. And oh! let his countenance be lovely, that\r\nhis friends may delight in his presence. Bend from your clouds, I said,\r\nghosts of my fathers, bend. Such was my song in Selma, to the lightly\r\ntrembling harp.\"]\r\n\r\nHow or why I know not, just at the moment, but I too muse and think of\r\nmy best friends in their distant homes--of William O'Connor, of\r\nMaurice Bucke, of John Burroughs, and of Mrs. Gilchrist--friends of my\r\nsoul--stanchest friends of my other soul, my poems.\r\n\r\n\r\nONLY A NEW FERRY-BOAT\r\n\r\n_Jan. 12, '82_.--Such a show as the Delaware presented an hour before\r\nsundown yesterday evening, all along between Philadelphia and Camden,\r\nis worth weaving into an item. It was full tide, a fair breeze from the\r\nsouthwest, the water of a pale tawny color, and just enough motion to\r\nmake things frolicsome and lively. Add to these an approaching sunset\r\nof unusual splendor, a broad tumble of clouds, with much golden haze and\r\nprofusion of beaming shaft and dazzle. In the midst of all, in the clear\r\ndrab of the afternoon light, there steam'd up the river the large,\r\nnew boat, \"the Wenonah,\" as pretty an object as you could wish to see,\r\nlightly and swiftly skimming along, all trim and white, cover'd with\r\nflags, transparent red and blue, streaming out in the breeze. Only a new\r\nferry-boat, and yet in its fitness comparable with the prettiest product\r\nof Nature's cunning, and rivaling it. High up in the transparent ether\r\ngracefully balanced and circled four or five great sea hawks, while here\r\nbelow, amid the pomp and picturesqueness of sky and river, swam this\r\ncreation of artificial beauty and motion and power, in its way no less\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF LONGFELLOW\r\n\r\n_Camden, April, '82_.--I have just return'd from an old forest haunt,\r\nwhere I love to go occasionally away from parlors, pavements, and the\r\nnewspapers and magazines--and where, of a clear forenoon, deep in the\r\nshade of pines and cedars and a tangle of old laurel-trees and vines,\r\nthe news of Longfellow's death first reach'd me. For want of anything\r\nbetter, let me lightly twine a sprig of the sweet ground-ivy trailing so\r\nplentifully through the dead leaves at my feet, with reflections of that\r\nhalf hour alone, there in the silence, and lay it as my contribution on\r\nthe dead bard's grave.\r\n\r\nLongfellow in his voluminous works seems to me not only to be eminent\r\nin the style and forms of poetical expression that mark the present age,\r\n(an idiosyncrasy, almost a sickness, of verbal melody,) but to bring\r\nwhat is always dearest as poetry to the general human heart and taste,\r\nand probably must be so in the nature of things. He is certainly the\r\nsort of bard and counteractant most needed for our materialistic,\r\nself-assertive, money-worshipping, Anglo-Saxon races, and especially for\r\nthe present age in America--an age tyrannically regulated with reference\r\nto the manufacturer, the merchant, the financier, the politician and\r\nthe day workman--for whom and among whom he comes as the poet of melody,\r\ncourtesy, deference--poet of the mellow twilight of the past in\r\nItaly, Germany, Spain, and in Northern Europe--poet of all sympathetic\r\ngentleness--and universal poet of women and young people. I should have\r\nto think long if I were ask'd to name the man who has done more, and in\r\nmore valuable directions, for America.\r\n\r\nI doubt if there ever was before such a fine intuitive judge and\r\nselecter of poems. His translations of many German and Scandinavian\r\npieces are said to be better than the vernaculars. He does not urge or\r\nlash. His influence is like good drink or air. He is not tepid either,\r\nbut always vital, with flavor, motion, grace. He strikes a splendid\r\naverage, and does not sing exceptional passions, or humanity's jagged\r\nescapades. He is not revolutionary, brings nothing offensive or new,\r\ndoes not deal hard blows. On the contrary, his songs soothe and heal, or\r\nif they excite, it is a healthy and agreeable excitement. His very\r\nanger is gentle, is at second hand, (as in the \"Quadroon Girl\" and the\r\n\"Witnesses.\")\r\n\r\nThere is no undue element of pensiveness in Longfellow's strains. Even\r\nin the early translation, the Manrique, the movement is as of strong\r\nand steady wind or tide, holding up and buoying. Death is not avoided\r\nthrough his many themes, but there is something almost winning in his\r\noriginal verses and renderings on that dread subject--as, closing \"the\r\nHappiest Land\" dispute,\r\n\r\n    And then the landlord's daughter\r\n      Up to heaven rais'd her hand,\r\n    And said, \"Ye may no more contend,\r\n      There lies the happiest land.\"\r\n\r\nTo the ungracious complaint-charge of his want of racy nativity and\r\nspecial originality, I shall only say that America and the world may\r\nwell be reverently thankful--can never be thankful enough--for any such\r\nsinging-bird vouchsafed out of the centuries, without asking that the\r\nnotes be different from those of other songsters; adding what I have\r\nheard Longfellow himself say, that ere the New World can be worthily\r\noriginal, and announce herself and her own heroes, she must be well\r\nsaturated with the originality of others, and respectfully consider the\r\nheroes that lived before Agamemnon.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARTING NEWSPAPERS\r\n\r\n_Reminiscences (From the \"Camden Courier\")_. As I sat taking my evening\r\nsail across the Delaware in the staunch ferry-boat \"Beverly,\" a night or\r\ntwo ago, I was join'd by two young reporter friends. \"I have a message\r\nfor you,\" said one of them; \"the C. folks told me to say they would like\r\na piece sign'd by your name, to go in their first number. Can you do\r\nit for them?\" \"I guess so,\" said I; \"what might it be about?\" \"Well,\r\nanything on newspapers, or perhaps what you've done yourself, starting\r\nthem.\" And off the boys went, for we had reach'd the Philadelphia side.\r\nThe hour was fine and mild, the bright half-moon shining; Venus, with\r\nexcess of splendor, just setting in the west, and the great Scorpion\r\nrearing its length more than half up in the southeast. As I cross'd\r\nleisurely for an hour in the pleasant night-scene, my young friend's\r\nwords brought up quite a string of reminiscences.\r\n\r\nI commenced when I was but a boy of eleven or twelve writing sentimental\r\nbits for the old \"Long Island Patriot,\" in Brooklyn; this was about\r\n1832. Soon after, I had a piece or two in George P. Morris's then\r\ncelebrated and fashionable \"Mirror,\" of New York city. I remember\r\nwith what half-suppress'd excitement I used to watch for the big, fat,\r\nred-faced, slow-moving, very old English carrier who distributed the\r\n\"Mirror\" in Brooklyn; and when I got one, opening and cutting the leaves\r\nwith trembling fingers. How it made my heart double-beat to see _my\r\npiece_ on the pretty white paper, in nice type.\r\n\r\nMy first real venture was the \"Long Islander,\" in my own beautiful\r\ntown of Huntington, in 1839. I was about twenty years old. I had been\r\nteaching country school for two or three years in various parts of\r\nSuffolk and Queens counties, but liked printing; had been at it while\r\na lad, learn'd the trade of compositor, and was encouraged to start a\r\npaper in the region where I was born. I went to New York, bought a press\r\nand types, hired some little help, but did most of the work myself,\r\nincluding the press-work. Everything seem'd turning out well; (only\r\nmy own restlessness prevented me gradually establishing a permanent\r\nproperty there.) I bought a good horse, and every week went all round\r\nthe country serving my papers, devoting one day and night to it. I never\r\nhad happier jaunts--going over to south side, to Babylon, down the south\r\nroad, across to Smithtown and Comac, and back home. The experiences of\r\nthose jaunts, the dear old-fashion'd farmers and their wives, the stops\r\nby the hay-fields, the hospitality, nice dinners, occasional evenings,\r\nthe girls, the rides through the brush, come up in my memory to this\r\nday.\r\n\r\nI next went to the \"Aurora\" daily in New York city--a sort of free\r\nlance. Also wrote regularly for the \"Tattler,\" an evening paper. With\r\nthese and a little outside work I was occupied off and on, until I\r\nwent to edit the \"Brooklyn Eagle,\" where for two years I had one of the\r\npleasantest sits of my life--a good owner, good pay, and easy work and\r\nhours. The troubles in the Democratic party broke forth about those\r\ntimes (1848-'49) and I split off with the radicals, which led to rows\r\nwith the boss and \"the party,\" and I lost my place.\r\n\r\nBeing now out of a job, I was offer'd impromptu, (it happen'd between\r\nthe acts one night in the lobby of the old Broadway theatre near Pearl\r\nstreet, New York city,) a good chance to go down to New Orleans on the\r\nstaff of the \"Crescent,\" a daily to be started there with plenty of\r\ncapital behind it. One of the owners, who was north buying material,\r\nmet me walking in the lobby, and though that was our first acquaintance,\r\nafter fifteen minutes' talk (and a drink) we made a formal bargain, and\r\nhe paid me two hundred dollars down to bind the contract and bear my\r\nexpenses to New Orleans. I started two days afterwards; had a good\r\nleisurely time, as the paper wasn't to be out in three weeks. I enjoy'd\r\nmy journey and Louisiana life much. Returning to Brooklyn a year or two\r\nafterward I started the \"Freeman,\" first as a weekly, then daily. Pretty\r\nsoon the secession war broke out, and I, too, got drawn in the current\r\nsouthward, and spent the following three years there, (as memorandized\r\npreceding.)\r\n\r\nBesides starting them as aforementioned, I have had to do, one time or\r\nanother, during my life, with a long list of papers, at divers places,\r\nsometimes under queer circumstances. During the war, the hospitals at\r\nWashington, among other means of amusement, printed a little sheet among\r\nthemselves, surrounded by wounds and death, the \"Armory Square Gazette,\"\r\nto which I contributed. The same long afterward, casually, to a paper--I\r\nthink it was call'd the \"Jimplecute\"--out in Colorado where I stopp'd at\r\nthe time. When I was in Quebec province, in Canada, in 1880, I went into\r\nthe queerest little old French printing-office near Tadousac. It was far\r\nmore primitive and ancient than my Camden friend William Kurtz's place\r\nup on Federal street. I remember, as a youngster, several characteristic\r\nold printers of a kind hard to be seen these days.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT UNREST OF WHICH WE ARE PART\r\n\r\nMy thoughts went floating on vast and mystic currents as I sat to-day in\r\nsolitude and half-shade by the creek--returning mainly to two principal\r\ncentres. One of my cherish'd themes for a never-achiev'd poem has been\r\nthe two impetuses of man and the universe--in the latter, creation's\r\nincessant unrest,[19] exfoliation, (Darwin's evolution, I suppose.)\r\nIndeed, what is Nature but change, in all its visible, and still\r\nmore its invisible processes? Or what is humanity in its faith, love,\r\nheroism, poetry, even morals, but _emotion_?\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n[19] \"Fifty thousand years ago the constellation of the Great Bear or\r\nDipper was a starry cross; a hundred thousand years hence the imaginary\r\nDipper will be upside down, and the stars which form the bowl and handle\r\nwill have changed places. The misty nebulae are moving, and besides\r\nare whirling around in great spirals, some one way, some another. Every\r\nmolecule of matter in the whole universe is swinging to and fro; every\r\nparticle of ether which fills space is in jelly-like vibration. Light\r\nis one kind of motion, heat another, electricity another, magnetism\r\nanother, sound another. Every human sense is the result of motion; every\r\nperception, every thought is but motion of the molecules of the brain\r\ntranslated by that incomprehensible thing we call mind. The processes\r\nof growth, of existence, of decay, whether in worlds, or in the minutest\r\norganisms, are but motion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBY EMERSON'S GRAVE\r\n\r\n_May 6, '82._--We stand by Emerson's new-made grave without\r\nsadness--indeed a solemn joy and faith, almost hauteur--our soul-benison\r\nno mere\r\n\r\n    \"Warrior, rest, thy task is done,\"\r\n\r\nfor one beyond the warriors of the world lies surely symboll'd here.\r\nA just man, poised on himself, all-loving, all-inclosing, and sane and\r\nclear as the sun. Nor does it seem so much Emerson himself we are here\r\nto honor--it is conscience, simplicity, culture, humanity's attributes\r\nat their best, yet applicable if need be to average affairs, and\r\neligible to all. So used are we to suppose a heroic death can only\r\ncome from out of battle or storm, or mighty personal contest, or amid\r\ndramatic incidents or danger, (have we not been taught so for ages by\r\nall the plays and poems?) that few even of those who most sympathizingly\r\nmourn Emerson's late departure will fully appreciate the ripen'd\r\ngrandeur of that event, with its play of calm and fitness, like evening\r\nlight on the sea.\r\n\r\nHow I shall henceforth dwell on the blessed hours when, not long since,\r\nI saw that benignant face, the clear eyes, the silently smiling mouth,\r\nthe form yet upright in its great age--to the very last, with so much\r\nspring and cheeriness, and such an absence of decrepitude, that even the\r\nterm _venerable_ hardly seem'd fitting.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the life now rounded and completed in its mortal development,\r\nand which nothing can change or harm more, has its most illustrious\r\nhalo, not in its splendid intellectual or esthetic products, but as\r\nforming in its entirety one of the few (alas! how few!) perfect and\r\nflawless excuses for being, of the entire literary class.\r\n\r\nWe can say, as Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg, It is not we who come to\r\nconsecrate the dead--we reverently come to receive, if so it may be,\r\nsome consecration to ourselves and daily work from him.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT PRESENT WRITING--PERSONAL\r\n\r\n_A letter to a German friend--extract_\r\n\r\n_May 31, '82._--\"From to-day I enter upon my 64th year. The paralysis\r\nthat first affected me nearly ten years ago, has since remain'd, with\r\nvarying course--seems to have settled quietly down, and will probably\r\ncontinue. I easily tire, am very clumsy, cannot walk far; but my spirits\r\nare first-rate. I go around in public almost every day--now and then\r\ntake long trips, by railroad or boat, hundreds of miles--live largely\r\nin the open air--am sunburnt and stout, (weigh 190)--keep up my activity\r\nand interest in life, people, progress, and the questions of the day.\r\nAbout two-thirds of the time I am quite comfortable. What mentality\r\nI ever had remains entirely unaffected; though physically I am a\r\nhalf-paralytic, and likely to be so, long as I live. But the principal\r\nobject of my life seems to have been accomplish'd--I have the most\r\ndevoted and ardent of friends, and affectionate relatives--and of\r\nenemies I really make no account.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER TRYING A CERTAIN BOOK\r\n\r\nI tried to read a beautifully printed and scholarly volume on \"the\r\nTheory of Poetry,\" received by mail this morning from England--but gave\r\nit up at last for a bad job. Here are some capricious pencillings that\r\nfollow'd, as I find them in my notes:\r\n\r\nIn youth and maturity Poems are charged with sunshine and varied pomp of\r\nday; but as the soul more and more takes precedence, (the sensuous still\r\nincluded,) the Dusk becomes the poet's atmosphere. I too have sought,\r\nand ever seek, the brilliant sun, and make my songs according. But as I\r\ngrow old, the half-lights of evening are far more to me.\r\n\r\nThe play of Imagination, with the sensuous objects of Nature for symbols\r\nand Faith--with Love and Pride as the unseen impetus and moving-power of\r\nall, make up the curious chess-game of a poem.\r\n\r\nCommon teachers or critics are always asking \"What does it mean?\"\r\nSymphony of fine musician, or sunset, or sea-waves rolling up the\r\nbeach--what do they mean? Undoubtedly in the most subtle-elusive sense\r\nthey mean something--as love does, and religion does, and the best\r\npoem;--but who shall fathom and define those meanings? (I do not intend\r\nthis as a warrant for wildness and frantic escapades--but to justify the\r\nsoul's frequent joy in what cannot be defined to the intellectual part,\r\nor to calculation.)\r\n\r\nAt its best, poetic lore is like what may be heard of conversation in\r\nthe dusk, from speakers far or hid, of which we get only a few broken\r\nmurmurs. What is not gather'd is far more--perhaps the main thing.\r\n\r\nGrandest poetic passages are only to be taken at free removes, as we\r\nsometimes look for stars at night, not by gazing directly toward them,\r\nbut off one side.\r\n\r\n(_To a poetic student and friend._)--I only seek to put you in rapport.\r\nYour own brain, heart, evolution, must not only understand the matter,\r\nbut largely supply it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINAL CONFESSIONS--LITERARY TESTS\r\n\r\nSo draw near their end these garrulous notes. There have doubtless\r\noccurr'd some repetitions, technical errors in the consecutiveness of\r\ndates, in the minutiae of botanical, astronomical, &c., exactness,\r\nand perhaps elsewhere;--for in gathering up, writing, peremptorily\r\ndispatching copy, this hot weather, (last of July and through August,\r\n'82,) and delaying not the printers, I have had to hurry along, no time\r\nto spare. But in the deepest veracity of all--in reflections of objects,\r\nscenes, Nature's outpourings, to my senses and receptivity, as they\r\nseem'd to me--in the work of giving those who care for it, some\r\nauthentic glints, specimen-days of my life--and in the _bona fide_\r\nspirit and relations, from author to reader, on all the subjects\r\ndesign'd, and as far as they go, I feel to make unmitigated claims.\r\n\r\nThe synopsis of my early life, Long Island, New York city, and so forth,\r\nand the diary-jottings in the Secession war, tell their own story. My\r\nplan in starting what constitutes most of the middle of the book, was\r\noriginally for hints and data of a Nature-poem that should carry one's\r\nexperiences a few hours, commencing at noon-flush, and so through\r\nthe after-part of the day--I suppose led to such idea by my own\r\nlife-afternoon now arrived. But I soon found I could move at more ease,\r\nby giving the narrative at first hand. (Then there is a humiliating\r\nlesson one learns, in serene hours, of a fine day or night. Nature seems\r\nto look on all fixed-up poetry and art as something almost impertinent.)\r\n\r\nThus I went on, years following, various seasons and areas, spinning\r\nforth my thought beneath the night and stars, (or as I was confined to\r\nmy room by half-sickness,) or at midday looking out upon the sea, or far\r\nnorth steaming over the Saguenay's black breast, jotting all down in the\r\nloosest sort of chronological order, and here printing from my\r\nimpromptu notes, hardly even the seasons group'd together, or anything\r\ncorrected--so afraid of dropping what smack of outdoors or sun or\r\nstarlight might cling to the lines, I dared not try to meddle with or\r\nsmooth them. Every now and then, (not often, but for a foil,) I carried\r\na book in my pocket--or perhaps tore out from some broken or cheap\r\nedition a bunch of loose leaves; most always had something of the sort\r\nready, but only took it out when the mood demanded. In that way, utterly\r\nout of reach of literary conventions, I re-read many authors.\r\n\r\nI cannot divest my appetite of literature, yet I find myself eventually\r\ntrying it all by Nature--_first premises_ many call it, but really the\r\ncrowning results of all, laws, tallies and proofs. (Has it never occur'd\r\nto any one how the last deciding tests applicable to a book are\r\nentirely outside of technical and grammatical ones, and that any truly\r\nfirst-class production has little or nothing to do with the rules and\r\ncalibres of ordinary critics? or the bloodless chalk of Allibone's\r\nDictionary? I have fancied the ocean and the daylight, the mountain\r\nand the forest, putting their spirit in a judgment on our books. I have\r\nfancied some disembodied human soul giving its verdict.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE AND DEMOCRACY--MORALITY\r\n\r\nDemocracy most of all affiliates with the open air, is sunny and hardy\r\nand sane only with Nature--just as much as Art is. Something is required\r\nto temper both--to check them, restrain them from excess, morbidity. I\r\nhave wanted, before departure, to bear special testimony to a very old\r\nlesson and requisite. American Democracy, in its myriad personalities,\r\nin factories, work-shops, stores, offices--through the dense streets and\r\nhouses of cities, and all their manifold sophisticated life--must either\r\nbe fibred, vitalized, by regular contact with out-door light and air and\r\ngrowths, farm-scenes, animals, fields, trees, birds, sun-warmth and free\r\nskies, or it will certainly dwindle and pale. We cannot have grand races\r\nof mechanics, work people, and commonalty, (the only specific purpose\r\nof America,) on any less terms. I conceive of no flourishing and heroic\r\nelements of Democracy in the United States, or of Democracy maintaining\r\nitself at all, without the Nature-element forming a main part--to be\r\nits health-element and beauty-element--to really underlie the whole\r\npolitics, sanity, religion and art of the New World.\r\n\r\nFinally, the morality: \"Virtue,\" said Marcus Aurelius, \"what is it,\r\nonly a living and enthusiastic sympathy with Nature?\" Perhaps indeed the\r\nefforts of the true poets, founders, religions, literatures, all ages,\r\nhave been, and ever will be, our time and times to come, essentially the\r\nsame--to bring people back from their persistent strayings and sickly\r\nabstractions, to the costless average, divine, original concrete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLECT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONE OR TWO INDEX ITEMS\r\n\r\n\r\nThough the ensuing COLLECT and preceding SPECIMEN DAYS are both largely\r\nfrom memoranda already existing, the hurried peremptory needs of copy\r\nfor the printers, already referr'd to--(the musicians' story of a\r\ncomposer up in a garret rushing the middle body and last of his score\r\ntogether, while the fiddlers are playing the first parts down in the\r\nconcert-room)--of this haste, while quite willing to get the consequent\r\nstimulus of life and motion, I am sure there must have resulted sundry\r\ntechnical errors. If any are too glaring they will be corrected in a\r\nfuture edition.\r\n\r\nA special word about PIECES IN EARLY YOUTH at the end. On jaunts over\r\nLong Island, as boy and young fellow, nearly half a century ago, I heard\r\nof, or came across in my own experience, characters, true occurrences,\r\nincidents, which I tried my 'prentice hand at recording--(I was\r\nthen quite an \"abolitionist\" and advocate of the \"temperance\" and\r\n\"anti-capital-punishment\" causes)--and publish'd during occasional\r\nvisits to New York city. A majority of the sketches appear'd first in\r\nthe \"Democratic Review,\" others in the \"Columbian Magazine,\" or the\r\n\"American Review,\" of that period. My serious wish were to have all\r\nthose crude and boyish pieces quietly dropp'd in oblivion--but to avoid\r\nthe annoyance of their surreptitious issue, (as lately announced, from\r\noutsiders,) I have, with some qualms, tack'd them on here. _A Dough-Face\r\nSong_ came out first in the \"Evening Post\"--_Blood-Money_, and _Wounded\r\nin the House of Friends_, in the \"Tribune.\"\r\n\r\n_Poetry To-day in America_, &c., first appear'd (under the name of \"_The\r\nPoetry of the Future_,\") in \"The North American Review\" for February,\r\n1881. _A Memorandum at a Venture_, in same periodical, some time\r\nafterward.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the convalescent out-door scenes and literary items,\r\npreceding, originally appear'd in the fortnightly \"Critic,\" of New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEMOCRATIC VISTAS\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the greatest lessons of Nature through the universe are perhaps the\r\nlessons of variety and freedom, the same present the greatest lessons\r\nalso in New World politics and progress. If a man were ask'd, for\r\ninstance, the distinctive points contrasting modern European and\r\nAmerican political and other life with the old Asiatic cultus, as\r\nlingering-bequeath'd yet in China and Turkey, he might find the amount\r\nof them in John Stuart Mill's profound essay on Liberty in the future,\r\nwhere he demands two main constituents, or sub-strata, for a truly grand\r\nnationality--1st, a large variety of character--and 2d, full play\r\nfor human nature to expand itself in numberless and even conflicting\r\ndirections--(seems to be for general humanity much like the influences\r\nthat make up, in their limitless field, that perennial health-action of\r\nthe air we call the weather--an infinite number of currents and forces,\r\nand contributions, and temperatures, and cross-purposes, whose ceaseless\r\nplay of counterpart upon counterpart brings constant restoration and\r\nvitality.) With this thought--and not for itself alone, but all it\r\nnecessitates, and draws after it--let me begin my speculations.\r\n\r\nAmerica, filling the present with greatest deeds and problems,\r\ncheerfully accepting the past, including feudalism, (as, indeed, the\r\npresent is but the legitimate birth of the past, including feudalism,)\r\ncounts, as I reckon, for her justification and success, (for who, as\r\nyet, dare claim success?) almost entirely on the future. Nor is that\r\nhope unwarranted. To-day, ahead, though dimly yet, we see, in vistas, a\r\ncopious, sane, gigantic offspring. For our New World I consider far less\r\nimportant for what it has done, or what it is, than for results to come.\r\nSole among nationalities, these States have assumed the task to put in\r\nforms of lasting power and practicality, on areas of amplitude rivaling\r\nthe operations of the physical kosmos, the moral political speculations\r\nof ages, long, long deferr'd, the democratic republican principle, and\r\nthe theory of development and perfection by voluntary standards, and\r\nself-reliance. Who else, indeed, except the United States, in history,\r\nso far, have accepted in unwitting faith, and, as we now see, stand, act\r\nupon, and go security for, these things? But preluding no longer, let\r\nme strike the key-note of the following strain. First premising that,\r\nthough the passages of it have been written at widely different\r\ntimes, (it is, in fact, a collection of memoranda, perhaps for future\r\ndesigners, comprehenders,) and though it may be open to the charge of\r\none part contradicting another--for there are opposite sides to the\r\ngreat question of democracy, as to every great question--I feel the\r\nparts harmoniously blended in my own realization and convictions, and\r\npresent them to be read only in such oneness, each page and each claim\r\nand assertion modified and temper'd by the others. Bear in mind, too,\r\nthat they are not the result of studying up in political economy, but of\r\nthe ordinary sense, observing, wandering among men, these States, these\r\nstirring years of war and peace. I will not gloss over the appaling\r\ndangers of universal suffrage in the United States. In fact, it is to\r\nadmit and face these dangers I am writing. To him or her within whose\r\nthought rages the battle, advancing, retreating, between democracy's\r\nconvictions, aspirations, and the people's crudeness, vice, caprices, I\r\nmainly write this essay. I shall use the words America and democracy as\r\nconvertible terms. Not an ordinary one is the issue. The United States\r\nare destined either to surmount the gorgeous history of feudalism, or\r\nelse prove the most tremendous failure of time. Not the least doubtful\r\nam I on any prospects of their material success. The triumphant future\r\nof their business, geographic and productive departments, on larger\r\nscales and in more varieties than ever, is certain. In those respects\r\nthe republic must soon (if she does not already) outstrip all examples\r\nhitherto afforded, and dominate the world.[20]\r\n\r\nAdmitting all this, with the priceless value of our political\r\ninstitutions, general suffrage, (and fully acknowledging the latest,\r\nwidest opening of the doors,) I say that, far deeper than these, what\r\nfinally and only is to make of our western world a nationality superior\r\nto any hither known, and out-topping the past, must be vigorous,\r\nyet unsuspected Literatures, perfect personalities and sociologies,\r\noriginal, transcendental, and expressing (what, in highest sense, are\r\nnot yet express'd at all,) democracy and the modern. With these, and\r\nout of these, I promulge new races of Teachers, and of perfect Women,\r\nindispensable to endow the birth-stock of a New World. For feudalism,\r\ncaste, the ecclesiastic traditions, though palpably retreating from\r\npolitical institutions, still hold essentially, by their spirit, even in\r\nthis country, entire possession of the more important fields, indeed the\r\nvery subsoil, of education, and of social standards and literature.\r\n\r\nI say that democracy can never prove itself beyond cavil, until it\r\nfounds and luxuriantly grows its own forms of art, poems, schools,\r\ntheology, displacing all that exists, or that has been produced anywhere\r\nin the past, under opposite influences. It is curious to me that\r\nwhile so many voices, pens, minds, in the press, lecture-rooms, in our\r\nCongress, &c., are discussing intellectual topics, pecuniary dangers,\r\nlegislative problems, the suffrage, tariff and labor questions, and the\r\nvarious business and benevolent needs of America, with propositions,\r\nremedies, often worth deep attention, there is one need, a hiatus the\r\nprofoundest, that no eye seems to perceive, no voice to state. Our\r\nfundamental want to-day in the United States, with closest, amplest\r\nreference to present conditions, and to the future, is of a class,\r\nand the clear idea of a class, of native authors, literatuses, far\r\ndifferent, far higher in grade than any yet known, sacerdotal, modern,\r\nfit to cope with our occasions, lands, permeating the whole mass of\r\nAmerican mentality, taste, belief, breathing into it a new breath of\r\nlife, giving it decision, affecting politics far more than the popular\r\nsuperficial suffrage, with results inside and underneath the elections\r\nof Presidents or Congresses--radiating, begetting appropriate teachers,\r\nschools, manners, and, as its grandest result, accomplishing, (what\r\nneither the schools nor the churches and their clergy have hitherto\r\naccomplish'd, and without which this nation will no more stand,\r\npermanently, soundly, than a house will stand without a substratum,) a\r\nreligious and moral character beneath the political and productive\r\nand intellectual bases of the States. For know you not, dear, earnest\r\nreader, that the people of our land may all read and write, and may\r\nall possess the right to vote--and yet the main things may be entirely\r\nlacking?--(and this to suggest them.)\r\n\r\nView'd, to-day, from a point of view sufficiently over-arching,\r\nthe problem of humanity all over the civilized world is social and\r\nreligious, and is to be finally met and treated by literature. The\r\npriest departs, the divine literatus comes. Never was anything more\r\nwanted than, to-day, and here in the States, the poet of the modern is\r\nwanted, or the great literatus of the modern. At all times, perhaps, the\r\ncentral point in any nation, and that whence it is itself really sway'd\r\nthe most, and whence it sways others, is its national literature,\r\nespecially its archetypal poems. Above all previous lands, a great\r\noriginal literature is surely to become the justification and reliance,\r\n(in some respects the sole reliance,) of American democracy.\r\n\r\nFew are aware how the great literature penetrates all, gives hue to\r\nall, shapes aggregates and individuals, and, after subtle ways, with\r\nirresistible power, constructs, sustains, demolishes at will. Why tower,\r\nin reminiscence, above all the nations of the earth, two special lands,\r\npetty in themselves, yet inexpressibly gigantic, beautiful, columnar?\r\nImmortal Judah lives, and Greece immortal lives, in a couple of poems.\r\n\r\nNearer than this. It is not generally realized, but it is true, as\r\nthe genius of Greece, and all the sociology, personality, politics\r\nand religion of those wonderful states, resided in their literature\r\nor esthetics, that what was afterwards the main support of European\r\nchivalry, the feudal, ecclesiastical, dynastic world over there--forming\r\nits osseous structure, holding it together for hundreds, thousands\r\nof years, preserving its flesh and bloom, giving it form, decision,\r\nrounding it out, and so saturating it in the conscious and unconscious\r\nblood, breed, belief, and intuitions of men, that it still prevails\r\npowerful to this day, in defiance of the mighty changes of time--was its\r\nliterature, permeating to the very marrow, especially that major part,\r\nits enchanting songs, ballads, and poems.[21]\r\n\r\nTo the ostent of the senses and eyes, I know, the influences which\r\nstamp the world's history are wars, uprisings or downfalls of dynasties,\r\nchangeful movements of trade, important inventions, navigation, military\r\nor civil governments, advent of powerful personalities, conquerors,\r\netc.. These of course play their part; yet, it may be, a single new\r\nthought, imagination, abstract principle, even literary style, fit for\r\nthe time, put in shape by some great literatus, and projected among\r\nmankind, may duly cause changes, growths, removals, greater than the\r\nlongest and bloodiest war, or the most stupendous merely political,\r\ndynastic, or commercial overturn.\r\n\r\nIn short, as, though it may not be realized, it is strictly true, that\r\na few first-class poets, philosophs, and authors, have substantially\r\nsettled and given status to the entire religion, education, law,\r\nsociology, &c., of the hitherto civilized world, by tinging and often\r\ncreating the atmospheres out of which they have arisen, such also\r\nmust stamp, and more than ever stamp, the interior and real democratic\r\nconstruction of this American continent, to-day, and days to come.\r\nRemember also this fact of difference, that, while through the antique\r\nand through the mediaeval ages, highest thoughts and ideals realized\r\nthemselves, and their expression made its way by other arts, as much\r\nas, or even more than by, technical literature, (not open to the mass of\r\npersons, or even to the majority of eminent persons,) such literature in\r\nour day and for current purposes, is not only more eligible than all\r\nthe other arts put together, but has become the only general means of\r\nmorally influencing the world. Painting, sculpture, and the dramatic\r\ntheatre, it would seem, no longer play an indispensable or even\r\nimportant part in the workings and mediumship of intellect, utility, or\r\neven high esthetics. Architecture remains, doubtless with capacities,\r\nand a real future. Then music, the combiner, nothing more spiritual,\r\nnothing more sensuous, a god, yet completely human, advances, prevails,\r\nholds highest place; supplying in certain wants and quarters what\r\nnothing else could supply. Yet in the civilization of to-day it is\r\nundeniable that, over all the arts, literature dominates, serves beyond\r\nall--shapes the character of church and school--or, at any rate, is\r\ncapable of doing so. Including the literature of science, its scope is\r\nindeed unparallel'd.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further, it were perhaps well to discriminate on\r\ncertain points. Literature tills its crops in many fields, and some\r\nmay flourish, while others lag. What I say in these Vistas has its main\r\nbearing on imaginative literature, especially poetry, the stock of all.\r\nIn the department of science, and the specialty of journalism, there\r\nappear, in these States, promises, perhaps fulfilments, of highest\r\nearnestness, reality, and life, These, of course, are modern. But in\r\nthe region of imaginative, spinal and essential attributes, something\r\nequivalent to creation is, for our age and lands, imperatively demanded.\r\nFor not only is it not enough that the new blood, new frame of\r\ndemocracy shall be vivified and held together merely by political means,\r\nsuperficial suffrage, legislation, &c., but it is clear to me that,\r\nunless it goes deeper, gets at least as firm and as warm a hold in\r\nmen's hearts, emotions and belief, as, in their days, feudalism or\r\necclesiasticism, and inaugurates its own perennial sources, welling from\r\nthe centre forever, its strength will be defective, its growth doubtful,\r\nand its main charm wanting. I suggest, therefore, the possibility,\r\nshould some two or three really original American poets, (perhaps\r\nartists or lecturers,) arise, mounting the horizon like planets, stars\r\nof the first magnitude, that, from their eminence, fusing contributions,\r\nraces, far localities, &c., together, they would give more compaction\r\nand more moral identity, (the quality to-day most needed,) to these\r\nStates, than all its Constitutions, legislative and judicial ties, and\r\nall its hitherto political, warlike, or materialistic experiences. As,\r\nfor instance, there could hardly happen anything that would more serve\r\nthe States, with all their variety of origins, their diverse climes,\r\ncities, standards, &c., than possessing an aggregate of heroes,\r\ncharacters, exploits, sufferings, prosperity or misfortune, glory or\r\ndisgrace, common to all, typical of all--no less, but even greater would\r\nit be to possess the aggregation of a cluster of mighty poets, artists,\r\nteachers, fit for us, national expressers, comprehending and effusing\r\nfor the men and women of the States, what is universal, native, common\r\nto all, inland and seaboard, northern and southern. The historians say\r\nof ancient Greece, with her ever-jealous autonomies, cities, and states,\r\nthat the only positive unity she ever own'd or receiv'd, was the sad\r\nunity of a common subjection, at the last, to foreign conquerors.\r\nSubjection, aggregation of that sort, is impossible to America; but\r\nthe fear of conflicting and irreconcilable interiors, and the lack of\r\na common skeleton, knitting all close, continually haunts me. Or, if it\r\ndoes not, nothing is plainer than the need, a long period to come, of\r\na fusion of the States into the only reliable identity, the moral\r\nand artistic one. For, I say, the true nationality of the States, the\r\ngenuine union, when we come to a moral crisis, is, and is to be, after\r\nall, neither the written law, nor, (as is generally supposed,) either\r\nself-interest, or common pecuniary or material objects--but the fervid\r\nand tremendous IDEA, melting everything else with resistless heat,\r\nand solving all lesser and definite distinctions in vast, indefinite,\r\nspiritual, emotional power.\r\n\r\nIt may be claim'd, (and I admit the weight of the claim,) that common\r\nand general worldly prosperity, and a populace well-to-do, and with all\r\nlife's material comforts, is the main thing, and is enough. It may be\r\nargued that our republic is, in performance, really enacting to-day the\r\ngrandest arts, poems, &c., by beating up the wilderness into fertile\r\nfarms, and in her railroads, ships, machinery, &c. And it may be ask'd,\r\nAre these not better, indeed, for America, than any utterances even of\r\ngreatest rhapsode, artist, or literatus?\r\n\r\nI too hail those achievements with pride and joy: then answer that\r\nthe soul of man will not with such only--nay, not with such at all--be\r\nfinally satisfied; but needs what, (standing on these and on all things,\r\nas the feet stand on the ground,) is address'd to the loftiest, to\r\nitself alone.\r\n\r\nOut of such considerations, such truths, arises for treatment in\r\nthese Vistas the important question of character, of an American\r\nstock-personality, with literatures and arts for outlets and\r\nreturn-expressions, and, of course, to correspond, within outlines\r\ncommon to all. To these, the main affair, the thinkers of the United\r\nStates, in general so acute, have either given feeblest attention, or\r\nhave remain'd, and remain, in a state of somnolence.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I would alarm and caution even the political and business\r\nreader, and to the utmost extent, against the prevailing delusion\r\nthat the establishment of free political institutions, and plentiful\r\nintellectual smartness, with general good order, physical plenty,\r\nindustry, &c., (desirable and precious advantages as they all are,) do,\r\nof themselves, determine and yield to our experiment of democracy the\r\nfruitage of success. With such advantages at present fully, or almost\r\nfully, possess'd--the Union just issued, victorious, from the struggle\r\nwith the only foes it need ever fear, (namely, those within itself,\r\nthe interior ones,) and with unprecedented materialistic\r\nadvancement--society, in these States, is canker'd, crude,\r\nsuperstitious, and rotten. Political, or law-made society is, and\r\nprivate, or voluntary society, is also. In any vigor, the element of\r\nthe moral conscience, the most important, the verteber to State or man,\r\nseems to me either entirely lacking, or seriously enfeebled or ungrown.\r\n\r\nI say we had best look our times and lands searchingly in the face, like\r\na physician diagnosing some deep disease. Never was there, perhaps,\r\nmore hollowness at heart than at present, and here in the United States.\r\nGenuine belief seems to have left us. The underlying principles of the\r\nStates are not honestly believ'd in, (for all this hectic glow, and\r\nthese melo-dramatic screamings,) nor is humanity itself believ'd in.\r\nWhat penetrating eye does not everywhere see through the mask? The\r\nspectacle is appaling. We live in an atmosphere of hypocrisy throughout.\r\nThe men believe not in the women, nor the women in the men. A scornful\r\nsuperciliousness rules in literature. The aim of all the _littérateurs_\r\nis to find something to make fun of. A lot of churches, sects, &c., the\r\nmost dismal phantasms I know, usurp the name of religion. Conversation\r\nis a mass of badinage. From deceit in the spirit, the mother of all\r\nfalse deeds, the offspring is already incalculable. An acute and candid\r\nperson, in the revenue department in Washington, who is led by the\r\ncourse of his employment to regularly visit the cities, north, south\r\nand west, to investigate frauds, has talk'd much with me about his\r\ndiscoveries. The depravity of the business classes of our country is\r\nnot less than has been supposed, but infinitely greater. The official\r\nservices of America, national, state, and municipal, in all their\r\nbranches and departments, except the judiciary, are saturated in\r\ncorruption, bribery, falsehood, mal-administration; and the judiciary\r\nis tainted. The great cities reek with respectable as much as\r\nnon-respectable robbery and scoundrelism. In fashionable life,\r\nflippancy, tepid amours, weak infidelism, small aims, or no aims at\r\nall, only to kill time. In business, (this all-devouring modern word,\r\nbusiness,) the one sole object is, by any means, pecuniary gain. The\r\nmagician's serpent in the fable ate up all the other serpents; and\r\nmoney-making is our magician's serpent, remaining today sole master of\r\nthe field. The best class we show, is but a mob of fashionably dress'd\r\nspeculators and vulgarians. True, indeed, behind this fantastic farce,\r\nenacted on the visible stage of society, solid things and stupendous\r\nlabors are to be discover'd, existing crudely and going on in the\r\nbackground, to advance and tell themselves in time. Yet the truths are\r\nnone the less terrible. I say that our New World democracy, however\r\ngreat a success in uplifting the masses out of their sloughs, in\r\nmaterialistic development, products, and in a certain highly-deceptive\r\nsuperficial popular intellectuality, is, so far, an almost complete\r\nfailure in its social aspects, and in really grand religious, moral,\r\nliterary, and esthetic results. In vain do we march with unprecedented\r\nstrides to empire so colossal, outvying the antique, beyond Alexander's,\r\nbeyond the proudest sway of Rome. In vain have we annex'd Texas,\r\nCalifornia, Alaska, and reach north for Canada and south for Cuba. It\r\nis as if we were somehow being endow'd with a vast and more and more\r\nthoroughly-appointed body, and then left with little or no soul.\r\n\r\nLet me illustrate further, as I write, with current observations,\r\nlocalities, &c. The subject is important, and will bear repetition.\r\nAfter an absence, I am now again (September, 1870) in New York city and\r\nBrooklyn, on a few weeks' vacation. The splendor, picturesqueness,\r\nand oceanic amplitude and rush of these great cities, the unsurpass'd\r\nsituation, rivers and bay, sparkling sea-tides, costly and lofty new\r\nbuildings, façades of marble and iron, of original grandeur and elegance\r\nof design, with the masses of gay color, the preponderance of white\r\nand blue, the flags flying, the endless ships, the tumultuous streets,\r\nBroadway, the heavy, low, musical roar, hardly ever intermitted, even\r\nat night; the jobbers' houses, the rich shops, the wharves, the great\r\nCentral Park, and the Brooklyn Park of hills, (as I wander among\r\nthem this beautiful fall weather, musing, watching, absorbing)--the\r\nassemblages of the citizens in their groups, conversations, trades,\r\nevening amusements, or along the by-quarters--these, I say, and the like\r\nof these, completely satisfy my senses of power, fulness, motion, &c.,\r\nand give me, through such senses and appetites, and through my esthetic\r\nconscience, a continued exaltation and absolute fulfilment. Always and\r\nmore and more, as I cross the East and North rivers, the ferries, or\r\nwith the pilots in their pilot-houses, or pass an hour in Wall street,\r\nor the gold exchange, I realize, (if we must admit such partialisms,)\r\nthat not Nature alone is great in her fields of freedom and the open\r\nair, in her storms, the shows of night and day, the mountains, forests,\r\nseas--but in the artificial, the work of man too is equally great--in\r\nthis profusion of teeming humanity--in these ingenuities, streets,\r\ngoods, houses, ships--these hurrying, feverish, electric crowds of men,\r\ntheir complicated business genius, (not least among the geniuses,) and\r\nall this mighty, many-threaded wealth and industry concentrated here.\r\n\r\nBut sternly discarding, shutting our eyes to the glow and grandeur of\r\nthe general superficial effect, coming down to what is of the only real\r\nimportance, Personalities, and examining minutely, we question, we ask,\r\nAre there, indeed, _men_ here worthy the name? Are there athletes? Are\r\nthere perfect women, to match the generous material luxuriance? Is there\r\na pervading atmosphere of beautiful manners? Are there crops of fine\r\nyouths, and majestic old persons? Are there arts worthy freedom and a\r\nrich people? Is there a great moral and religious civilization--the\r\nonly justification of a great material one? Confess that to severe eyes,\r\nusing the moral microscope upon humanity, a sort of dry and flat Sahara\r\nappears, these cities, crowded with petty grotesques, malformations,\r\nphantoms, playing meaningless antics.\r\n\r\nConfess that everywhere, in shop, street, church, theatre, bar-room,\r\nofficial chair, are pervading flippancy and vulgarity, low cunning,\r\ninfidelity--everywhere the youth puny, impudent, foppish, prematurely\r\nripe--everywhere an abnormal libidinousness, unhealthy forms, male,\r\nfemale, painted, padded, dyed, chignon'd, muddy complexions, bad blood,\r\nthe capacity for good motherhood deceasing or deceas'd, shallow\r\nnotions of beauty, with a range of manners, or rather lack of manners,\r\n(considering the advantages enjoy'd,) probably the meanest to be seen in\r\nthe world.[22]\r\n\r\nOf all this, and these lamentable conditions, to breathe into them\r\nthe breath recuperative of sane and heroic life, I say a new founded\r\nliterature, not merely to copy and reflect existing surfaces, or pander\r\nto what is called taste--not only to amuse, pass away time, celebrate\r\nthe beautiful, the refined, the past, or exhibit technical, rhythmic,\r\nor grammatical dexterity--but a literature underlying life, religious,\r\nconsistent with science, handling the elements and forces with competent\r\npower, teaching and training men--and, as perhaps the most precious\r\nof its results, achieving the entire redemption of woman out of these\r\nincredible holds and webs of silliness, millinery, and every kind of\r\ndyspeptic depletion--and thus insuring to the States a strong and sweet\r\nFemale Race, a race of perfect Mothers--is what is needed.\r\n\r\nAnd now, in the full conception of these facts and points, and all that\r\nthey infer, pro and con--with yet unshaken faith in the elements of the\r\nAmerican masses, the composites, of both sexes, and even consider'd as\r\nindividuals--and ever recognizing in them the broadest bases of the\r\nbest literary and esthetic appreciation--I proceed with my speculations,\r\nVistas.\r\n\r\nFirst, let us see what we can make out of a brief, general, sentimental\r\nconsideration of political democracy, and whence it has arisen, with\r\nregard to some of its current features, as an aggregate, and as the\r\nbasic structure of our future literature and authorship. We shall, it is\r\ntrue, quickly and continually find the origin-idea of the singleness of\r\nman, individualism, asserting itself, and cropping forth, even from the\r\nopposite ideas. But the mass, or lump character, for imperative reasons,\r\nis to be ever carefully weigh'd, borne in mind, and provided for. Only\r\nfrom it, and from its proper regulation and potency, comes the other,\r\ncomes the chance of individualism. The two are contradictory, but our\r\ntask is to reconcile them.[23]\r\n\r\nThe political history of the past may be summ'd up as having grown out\r\nof what underlies the words, order, safety, caste, and especially out of\r\nthe need of some prompt deciding authority, and of cohesion at all cost.\r\nLeaping time, we come to the period within the memory of people\r\nnow living, when, as from some lair where they had slumber'd long,\r\naccumulating wrath, sprang up and are yet active, (1790, and on eyen to\r\nthe present, 1870,) those noisy eructations, destructive iconoclasms, a\r\nfierce sense of wrongs, amid which moves the form, well known in modern\r\nhistory, in the old world, stain'd with much blood, and mark'd by savage\r\nreactionary clamors and demands. These bear, mostly, as on one inclosing\r\npoint of need.\r\n\r\nFor after the rest is said--after the many time-honor'd and really true\r\nthings for subordination, experience, rights of property, &c., have\r\nbeen listen'd to and acquiesced in--after the valuable and well-settled\r\nstatement of our duties and relations in society is thoroughly conn'd\r\nover and exhausted--it remains to bring forward and modify everything\r\nelse with the idea of that Something a man is, (last precious\r\nconsolation of the drudging poor,) standing apart from all else, divine\r\nin his own right, and a woman in hers, sole and untouchable by any\r\ncanons of authority, or any rule derived from precedent, state-safety,\r\nthe acts of legislatures, or even from what is called religion, modesty,\r\nor art. The radiation of this truth is the key of the most significant\r\ndoings of our immediately preceding three centuries, and has been the\r\npolitical genesis and life of America. Advancing visibly, it still more\r\nadvances invisibly. Underneath the fluctuations of the expressions of\r\nsociety, as well as the movements of the politics of the leading nations\r\nof the world, we see steadily pressing ahead and strengthening itself,\r\neven in the midst of immense tendencies toward aggregation, this image\r\nof completeness in separatism, of individual personal dignity, of a\r\nsingle person, either male or female, characterized in the main, not\r\nfrom extrinsic acquirements or position, but in the pride of himself or\r\nherself alone; and, as an eventual conclusion and summing up, (or else\r\nthe entire scheme of things is aimless, a cheat, a crash,) the simple\r\nidea that the last, best dependence is to be upon humanity itself, and\r\nits own inherent, normal, fullgrown qualities, without any superstitious\r\nsupport whatever. This idea of perfect individualism it is indeed that\r\ndeepest tinges and gives character to the idea of the aggregate. For it\r\nis mainly or altogether to serve independent separatism that we favor a\r\nstrong generalization, consolidation. As it is to give the best vitality\r\nand freedom to the rights of the States, (every bit as important as the\r\nright of nationality, the union,) that we insist on the identity of the\r\nUnion at all hazards.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of democracy--supplanting old belief in the necessary\r\nabsoluteness of establish'd dynastic rulership, temporal,\r\necclesiastical, and scholastic, as furnishing the only security against\r\nchaos, crime, and ignorance--is, through many transmigrations, and amid\r\nendless ridicules, arguments, and ostensible failures, to illustrate,\r\nat all hazards, this doctrine or theory that man, properly train'd in\r\nsanest, highest freedom, may and must become a law, and series of laws,\r\nunto himself, surrounding and providing for, not only his own personal\r\ncontrol, but all his relations to other individuals, and to the State;\r\nand that, while other theories, as in the past histories of nations,\r\nhave proved wise enough, and indispensable perhaps for their conditions,\r\n_this,_ as matters now stand in our civilized world, is the only scheme\r\nworth working from, as warranting results like those of Nature's laws,\r\nreliable, when once establish'd, to carry on themselves.\r\n\r\nThe argument of the matter is extensive, and, we admit, by no means all\r\non one side. What we shall offer will be far, far from sufficient. But\r\nwhile leaving unsaid much that should properly even prepare the way\r\nfor the treatment of this many-sided question of political liberty,\r\nequality, or republicanism--leaving the whole history and consideration\r\nof the feudal plan and its products, embodying humanity, its politics\r\nand civilization, through the retrospect of past time, (which plan\r\nand products, indeed, make up all of the past, and a large part of the\r\npresent)--leaving unanswer'd, at least by any specific and local answer,\r\nmany a well-wrought argument and instance, and many a conscientious\r\ndeclamatory cry and warning--as, very lately, from an eminent and\r\nvenerable person abroad[24]--things, problems, full of doubt, dread,\r\nsuspense, (not new to me, but old occupiers of many an anxious hour in\r\ncity's din, or night's silence,) we still may give a page or so, whose\r\ndrift is opportune. Time alone can finally answer these things. But as\r\na substitute in passing, let us, even if fragmentarily, throw forth a\r\nshort direct or indirect suggestion of the premises of that other plan,\r\nin the new spirit, under the new forms, started here in our America.\r\n\r\nAs to the political section of Democracy, which introduces and breaks\r\nground for further and vaster sections, few probably are the minds, even\r\nin these republican States, that fully comprehend the aptness of that\r\nphrase, \"THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE,\"\r\nwhich we inherit from the lips of Abraham Lincoln; a formula whose\r\nverbal shape is homely wit, but whose scope includes both the totality\r\nand all minutiae of the lesson.\r\n\r\nThe People! Like our huge earth itself, which, to ordinary scansion,\r\nis full of vulgar contradictions and offence, man, viewed in the lump,\r\ndispleases, and is a constant puzzle and affront to the merely educated\r\nclasses. The rare, cosmical, artist-mind, lit with the Infinite, alone\r\nconfronts his manifold and oceanic qualities--but taste, intelligence\r\nand culture, (so-called,) have been against the masses, and remain so.\r\nThere is plenty of glamour about the most damnable crimes and hoggish\r\nmeannesses, special and general, of the feudal and dynastic world\r\nover there, with its _personnel_ of lords and queens and courts, so\r\nwell-dress'd and so handsome. But the People are ungrammatical, untidy,\r\nand their sins gaunt and ill-bred.\r\n\r\nLiterature, strictly consider'd, has never recognized the People,\r\nand, whatever may be said, does not to-day. Speaking generally, the\r\ntendencies of literature, as hitherto pursued, have been to make mostly\r\ncritical and querulous men. It seems as if, so far, there were some\r\nnatural repugnance between a literary and professional life, and the\r\nrude rank spirit of the democracies. There is, in later literature, a\r\ntreatment of benevolence, a charity business, rife enough it is\r\ntrue; but I know nothing more rare, even in this country, than a fit\r\nscientific estimate and reverent appreciation of the People--of their\r\nmeasureless wealth of latent power and capacity, their vast, artistic\r\ncontrasts of lights and shades--with, in America, their entire\r\nreliability in emergencies, and a certain breadth of historic grandeur,\r\nof peace or war, far surpassing all the vaunted samples of book-heroes,\r\nor any _haut ton_ coteries, in all the records of the world.\r\n\r\nThe movements of the late secession war, and their results, to any sense\r\nthat studies well and comprehends them, show that popular democracy,\r\nwhatever its faults and dangers, practically justifies itself beyond the\r\nproudest claims and wildest hopes of its enthusiasts. Probably no future\r\nage can know, but I well know, how the gist of this fiercest and most\r\nresolute of the world's war-like contentions resided exclusively in the\r\nunnamed, unknown rank and file; and how the brunt of its labor of death\r\nwas, to all essential purposes, volunteer'd. The People, of their own\r\nchoice, fighting, dying for their own idea, insolently attack'd by the\r\nsecession-slave-power, and its very existence imperil'd. Descending\r\nto detail, entering any of the armies, and mixing with the private\r\nsoldiers, we see and have seen august spectacles. We have seen the\r\nalacrity with which the American-born populace, the peaceablest and most\r\ngood-natured race in the world, and the most personally independent\r\nand intelligent, and the least fitted to submit to the irksomeness and\r\nexasperation of regimental discipline, sprang, at the first tap of the\r\ndrum, to arms--not for gain, nor even glory, nor to repel invasion--but\r\nfor an emblem, a mere abstraction--for the life, _the safety of the\r\nflag_. We have seen the unequal'd docility and obedience of these\r\nsoldiers. We have seen them tried long and long by hopelessness,\r\nmismanagement, and by defeat; have seen the incredible slaughter toward\r\nor through which the armies (as at first Fredericksburg, and afterward\r\nat the Wilderness,) still unhesitatingly obey'd orders to advance. We\r\nhave seen them in trench, or crouching behind breastwork, or tramping\r\nin deep mud, or amid pouring rain or thick-falling snow, or under forced\r\nmarches in hottest summer (as on the road to get to Gettysburg)--vast\r\nsuffocating swarms, divisions, corps, with every single man so grimed\r\nand black with sweat and dust, his own mother would not have known\r\nhim--his clothes all dirty, stain'd and torn, with sour, accumulated\r\nsweat for perfume--many a comrade, perhaps a brother, sun-struck,\r\nstaggering out, dying, by the roadside, of exhaustion--yet the great\r\nbulk bearing steadily on, cheery enough, hollow-bellied from hunger, but\r\nsinewy with unconquerable resolution.\r\n\r\nWe have seen this race proved by wholesale by drearier, yet more fearful\r\ntests--the wound, the amputation, the shatter'd face or limb, the\r\nslow hot fever, long impatient anchorage in bed, and all the forms of\r\nmaiming, operation and disease. Alas! America have we seen, though only\r\nin her early youth, already to hospital brought. There have we watch'd\r\nthese soldiers, many of them only boys in years--mark'd their decorum,\r\ntheir religious nature and fortitude, and their sweet affection.\r\nWholesale, truly. For at the front, and through the camps, in countless\r\ntents, stood the regimental, brigade and division hospitals; while\r\neverywhere amid the land, in or near cities, rose clusters of huge,\r\nwhite-wash'd, crowded, one-story wooden barracks; and there ruled agony\r\nwith bitter scourge, yet seldom brought a cry; and there stalk'd death\r\nby day and night along the narrow aisles between the rows of cots, or\r\nby the blankets on the ground, and touch'd lightly many a poor sufferer,\r\noften with blessed, welcome touch.\r\n\r\nI know not whether I shall be understood, but I realize that it is\r\nfinally from what I learn'd personally mixing in such scenes that I am\r\nnow penning these pages. One night in the gloomiest period of the war,\r\nin the Patent-office hospital in Washington city, as I stood by\r\nthe bedside of a Pennsylvania soldier, who lay, conscious of quick\r\napproaching death, yet perfectly calm, and with noble, spiritual manner,\r\nthe veteran surgeon, turning aside, said to me, that though he had\r\nwitness'd many, many deaths of soldiers, and had been a worker at Bull\r\nRun, Antietam, Fredericksburg, &c., he had not seen yet the first case\r\nof man or boy that met the approach of dissolution with cowardly qualms\r\nor terror. My own observation fully bears out the remark.\r\n\r\nWhat have we here, if not, towering above all talk and argument,\r\nthe plentifully-supplied, last-needed proof of democracy, in its\r\npersonalities? Curiously enough, too, the proof on this point comes,\r\nI should say, every bit as much from the south, as from the north.\r\nAlthough I have spoken only of the latter, yet I deliberately include\r\nall. Grand, common stock! to me the accomplish'd and convincing growth,\r\nprophetic of the future; proof undeniable to sharpest sense, of perfect\r\nbeauty, tenderness and pluck, that never feudal lord, nor Greek, nor\r\nRoman breed, yet rival'd. Let no tongue ever speak in disparagement of\r\nthe American races, north or south, to one who has been through the war\r\nin the great army hospitals.\r\n\r\nMeantime, general humanity, (for to that we return, as, for our\r\npurposes, what it really is, to bear in mind,) has always, in every\r\ndepartment, been full of perverse maleficence, and is so yet. In\r\ndowncast hours the soul thinks it always will be--but soon recovers\r\nfrom such sickly moods. I myself see clearly enough the crude, defective\r\nstreaks in all the strata of the common people; the specimens and vast\r\ncollections of the ignorant, the credulous, the unfit and uncouth, the\r\nincapable, and the very low and poor. The eminent person just mention'd\r\nsneeringly asks whether we expect to elevate and improve a nation's\r\npolitics by absorbing such morbid collections and qualities therein. The\r\npoint is a formidable one, and there will doubtless always be numbers of\r\nsolid and reflective citizens who will never get over it. Our answer\r\nis general, and is involved in the scope and letter of this essay.\r\nWe believe the ulterior object of political and all other government,\r\n(having, of course, provided for the police, the safety of life,\r\nproperty, and for the basic statute and common law, and their\r\nadministration, always first in order,) to be among the rest, not\r\nmerely to rule, to repress disorder, &c., but to develop, to open up to\r\ncultivation, to encourage the possibilities of all beneficent and manly\r\noutcroppage, and of that aspiration for independence, and the pride and\r\nself-respect latent in all characters. (Or, if there be exceptions, we\r\ncannot, fixing our eyes on them alone, make theirs the rule for all.)\r\n\r\nI say the mission of government, henceforth, in civilized lands, is not\r\nrepression alone, and not Authority alone, not even of law, nor by that\r\nfavorite standard of the eminent writer, the rule of the best men, the\r\nborn heroes and captains of the race, (as if such ever, or one time out\r\nof a hundred, get into the big places, elective or dynastic)--but higher\r\nthan the highest arbitrary rule, to train communities through all their\r\ngrades, beginning with individuals and ending there again, to rule\r\nthemselves. What Christ appear'd for in the moral-spiritual field for\r\nhuman-kind, namely, that in respect to the absolute soul, there is\r\nin the possession of such by each single individual, something so\r\ntranscendent, so incapable of gradations, (like life,) that, to that\r\nextent, it places all beings on a common level, utterly regardless\r\nof the distinctions of intellect, virtue, station, or any height or\r\nlowliness whatever--is tallied in like manner, in this other field, by\r\ndemocracy's rule that men, the nation, as a common aggregate of living\r\nidentities, affording in each a separate and complete subject for\r\nfreedom, worldly thrift and happiness, and for a fair chance for growth,\r\nand for protection in citizenship, &c., must, to the political extent\r\nof the suffrage or vote, if no further, be placed, in each and in the\r\nwhole, on one broad, primary, universal, common platform.\r\n\r\nThe purpose is not altogether direct; perhaps it is more indirect. For\r\nit is not that democracy is of exhaustive account, in itself. Perhaps,\r\nindeed, it is, (like Nature,) of no account in itself. It is that, as\r\nwe see, it is the best, perhaps only, fit and full means, formulater,\r\ngeneral caller-forth, trainer, for the million, not for grand material\r\npersonalities only, but for immortal souls. To be a voter with the\r\nrest is not so much; and this, like every institute, will have its\r\nimperfections.\r\n\r\nBut to become an enfranchised man, and now, impediments removed,\r\nto stand and start without humiliation, and equal with the rest; to\r\ncommence, or have the road clear'd to commence, the grand experiment of\r\ndevelopment, whose end, (perhaps requiring several generations,) may\r\nbe the forming of a full-grown man or woman--that _is_ something. To\r\nballast the State is also secured, and in our times is to be secured, in\r\nno other way.\r\n\r\nWe do not, (at any rate I do not,) put it either on the ground that\r\nthe People, the masses, even the best of them, are, in their latent or\r\nexhibited qualities, essentially sensible and good--nor on the ground of\r\ntheir rights; but that good or bad, rights or no rights, the democratic\r\nformula is the only safe and preservative one for coming times. We endow\r\nthe masses with the suffrage for their own sake, no doubt; then, perhaps\r\nstill more, from another point of view, for community's sake. Leaving\r\nthe rest to the sentimentalists, we present freedom as sufficient in\r\nits scientific aspect, cold as ice, reasoning, deductive, clear and\r\npassionless as crystal.\r\n\r\nDemocracy too is law, and of the strictest, amplest kind. Many suppose,\r\n(and often in its own ranks the error,) that it means a throwing aside\r\nof law, and running riot. But, briefly, it is the superior law, not\r\nalone that of physical force, the body, which, adding to, it supersedes\r\nwith that of the spirit. Law is the unshakable order of the universe\r\nforever; and the law over all, and law of laws, is the law of\r\nsuccessions; that of the superior law, in time, gradually supplanting\r\nand overwhelming the inferior one. (While, for myself, I would\r\ncheerfully agree--first covenanting that the formative tendencies shall\r\nbe administer'd in favor, or at least not against it, and that this\r\nreservation be closely construed--that until the individual or community\r\nshow due signs, or be so minor and fractional as not to endanger\r\nthe State, the condition of authoritative tutelage may continue, and\r\nself-government must abide its time.) Nor is the esthetic point, always\r\nan important one, without fascination for highest aiming souls. The\r\ncommon ambition strains for elevations, to become some privileged\r\nexclusive. The master sees greatness and health in being part of the\r\nmass; nothing will do as well as common ground. Would you have in\r\nyourself the divine, vast, general law? Then merge yourself in it.\r\n\r\nAnd, topping democracy, this most alluring record, that it alone can\r\nbind, and ever seeks to bind, all nations, all men, of however various\r\nand distant lands, into a brotherhood, a family. It is the old, yet\r\never-modern dream of earth, out of her eldest and her youngest, her\r\nfond philosophers and poets. Not that half only, individualism, which\r\nisolates. There is another half, which is adhesiveness or love, that\r\nfuses, ties and aggregates, making the races comrades, and fraternizing\r\nall. Both are to be vitalized by religion, (sole worthiest elevator of\r\nman or State,) breathing into the proud, material tissues, the breath\r\nof life. For I say at the core of democracy, finally, is the religious\r\nelement. All the religions, old and new, are there. Nor may the scheme\r\nstep forth, clothed in resplendent beauty and command, till these,\r\nbearing the best, the latest fruit, the spiritual, shall fully appear.\r\n\r\nA portion of our pages we might indite with reference toward Europe,\r\nespecially the British part of it, more than our own land, perhaps not\r\nabsolutely needed for the home reader. But the whole question hangs\r\ntogether, and fastens and links all peoples. The liberalist of to-day\r\nhas this advantage over antique or mediaeval times, that his doctrine\r\nseeks not only to individualize but to universalize. The great word\r\nSolidarity has arisen. Of all dangers to a nation, as things exist in\r\nour day, there can be no greater one than having certain portions of\r\nthe people set off from the rest by a line drawn--they not privileged\r\nas others, but degraded, humiliated, made of no account. Much quackery\r\nteems, of course, even on democracy's side, yet does not really affect\r\nthe orbic quality of the matter. To work in, if we may so term it, and\r\njustify God, his divine aggregate, the People, (or, the veritable horn'd\r\nand sharp-tail'd Devil, _his_ aggregate, if there be who convulsively\r\ninsist upon it)--this, I say, is what democracy is for; and this is what\r\nour America means, and is doing--may I not say, has done? If not, she\r\nmeans nothing more, and does nothing more, than any other land. And as,\r\nby virtue of its kosmical, antiseptic power, Nature's stomach is fully\r\nstrong enough not only to digest the morbific matter always presented,\r\nnot to be turn'd aside, and perhaps, indeed, intuitively gravitating\r\nthither--but even to change such contributions into nutriment for\r\nhighest use and life--so American democracy's. That is the lesson we,\r\nthese days, send over to European lands by every western breeze.\r\n\r\nAnd, truly, whatever may be said in the way of abstract argument, for\r\nor against the theory of a wider democratizing of institutions in any\r\ncivilized country, much trouble might well be saved to all European\r\nlands by recognizing this palpable fact, (for a palpable fact it is,)\r\nthat some form of such democratizing is about the only resource now\r\nleft. _That_, or chronic dissatisfaction continued, mutterings which\r\ngrow annually louder and louder, till, in due course, and pretty swiftly\r\nin most cases, the inevitable crisis, crash, dynastic ruin. Anything\r\nworthy to be call'd statesmanship in the Old World, I should say, among\r\nthe advanced students, adepts, or men of any brains, does not debate\r\nto-day whether to hold on, attempting to lean back and monarchize, or\r\nto look forward and democratize--but _how_, and in what degree and part,\r\nmost prudently to democratize.\r\n\r\nThe eager and often inconsiderate appeals of reformers and\r\nrevolutionists are indispensable, to counterbalance the inertness and\r\nfossilism making so large a part of human institutions. The latter will\r\nalways take care of themselves--the danger being that they rapidly tend\r\nto ossify us. The former is to be treated with indulgence, and even with\r\nrespect. As circulation to air, so is agitation and a plentiful degree\r\nof speculative license to political and moral sanity. Indirectly, but\r\nsurely, goodness, virtue, law, (of the very best,) follow freedom.\r\nThese, to democracy, are what the keel is to the ship, or saltness to\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\nThe true gravitation-hold of liberalism in the United States will be\r\na more universal ownership of property, general homesteads, general\r\ncomfort--a vast, intertwining reticulation of wealth. As the human\r\nframe, or, indeed, any object in this manifold universe, is best kept\r\ntogether by the simple miracle of its own cohesion, and the necessity,\r\nexercise and profit thereof, so a great and varied nationality,\r\noccupying millions of square miles, were firmest held and knit by the\r\nprinciple of the safety and endurance of the aggregate of its middling\r\nproperty owners. So that, from another point of view, ungracious as it\r\nmay sound, and a paradox after what we have been saying, democracy looks\r\nwith suspicious, ill-satisfied eye upon the very poor, the ignorant, and\r\non those out of business. She asks for men and women with occupations,\r\nwell-off, owners of houses and acres, and with cash in the bank--and\r\nwith some cravings for literature, too; and must have them, and hastens\r\nto make them. Luckily, the seed is already well-sown, and has taken\r\nineradicable root.[25]\r\n\r\nHuge and mighty are our days, our republican lands--and most in their\r\nrapid shiftings, their changes, all in the interest of the cause. As I\r\nwrite this particular passage, (November, 1868,) the din of disputation\r\nrages around me. Acrid the temper of the parties, vital the pending\r\nquestions. Congress convenes; the President sends his message;\r\nreconstruction is still in abeyance; the nomination and the contest\r\nfor the twenty-first Presidentiad draw close, with loudest threat and\r\nbustle. Of these, and all the like of these, the eventuations I know\r\nnot; but well I know that behind them, and whatever their eventuations,\r\nthe vital things remain safe and certain, and all the needed work goes\r\non. Time, with soon or later superciliousness, disposes of Presidents,\r\nCongressmen, party platforms, and such. Anon, it clears the stage of\r\neach and any mortal shred that thinks itself so potent to its day; and\r\nat and after which, (with precious, golden exceptions once or twice in\r\na century,) all that relates to sir potency is flung to moulder in\r\na burial-vault, and no one bothers himself the least bit about it\r\nafterward. But the People ever remain, tendencies continue, and all the\r\nidiocratic transfers in unbroken chain go on.\r\n\r\nIn a few years the dominion-heart of America will be far inland, toward\r\nthe west. Our future national capital may not be where the present one\r\nis. It is possible, nay likely, that in less than fifty years, it will\r\nmigrate a thousand or two miles, will be re-founded, and every thing\r\nbelonging to it made on a different plan, original, far more superb. The\r\nmain social, political, spine-character of the States will probably run\r\nalong the Ohio, Missouri and Mississippi rivers, and west and north\r\nof them, including Canada. Those regions, with the group of powerful\r\nbrothers toward the Pacific, (destined to the mastership of that sea and\r\nits countless paradises of islands,) will compact and settle the traits\r\nof America, with all the old retain'd, but more expanded, grafted on\r\nnewer, hardier, purely native stock. A giant growth, composite from\r\nthe rest, getting their contribution, absorbing it, to make it more\r\nillustrious. From the north, intellect, the sun of things, also the idea\r\nof unswayable justice, anchor amid the last, the wildest tempests.\r\nFrom the south the living soul, the animus of good and bad, haughtily\r\nadmitting no demonstration but its own. While from the west itself\r\ncomes solid personality, with blood and brawn, and the deep quality of\r\nall-accepting fusion.\r\n\r\nPolitical democracy, as it exists and practically works in America,\r\nwith all its threatening evils, supplies a training-school for making\r\nfirst-class men. It is life's gymnasium, not of good only, but of\r\nall. We try often, though we fall back often. A brave delight, fit for\r\nfreedom's athletes, fills these arenas, and fully satisfies, out of the\r\naction in them, irrespective of success. Whatever we do not attain, we\r\nat any rate attain the experiences of the fight, the hardening of the\r\nstrong campaign, and throb with currents of attempt at least. Time is\r\nample. Let the victors come after us. Not for nothing does evil play\r\nits part among us. Judging from the main portions of the history of the\r\nworld, so far, justice is always in jeopardy, peace walks amid hourly\r\npitfalls, and of slavery, misery, meanness, the craft of tyrants and the\r\ncredulity of the populace, in some of their protean forms, no voice can\r\nat any time say, They are not. The clouds break a little, and the sun\r\nshines out--but soon and certain the lowering darkness falls again, as\r\nif to last forever. Yet is there an immortal courage and prophecy\r\nin every sane soul that cannot, must not, under any circumstances,\r\ncapitulate. _Vive_, the attack--the perennial assault! _Vive_, the\r\nunpopular cause--the spirit that audaciously aims--the never-abandon'd\r\nefforts, pursued the same amid opposing proofs and precedents.\r\n\r\nOnce, before the war, (alas! I dare not say how many times the mood has\r\ncome!) I, too, was fill'd with doubt and gloom. A foreigner, an acute\r\nand good man, had impressively said to me, that day--putting in form,\r\nindeed, my own observations: \"I have travel'd much in the United States,\r\nand watch'd their politicians, and listen'd to the speeches of the\r\ncandidates, and read the journals, and gone into the public houses, and\r\nheard the unguarded talk of men. And I have found your vaunted America\r\nhoneycomb'd from top to toe with infidelism, even to itself and its own\r\nprogramme. I have mark'd the brazen hell-faces of secession and slavery\r\ngazing defiantly from all the windows and doorways. I have everywhere\r\nfound, primarily, thieves and scalliwags arranging the nominations to\r\noffices, and sometimes filling the offices themselves. I have found the\r\nnorth just as full of bad stuff as the south. Of the holders of public\r\noffice in the Nation or the States or their municipalities, I have found\r\nthat not one in a hundred has been chosen by any spontaneous selection\r\nof the outsiders, the people, but all have been nominated and put\r\nthrough by little or large caucuses of the politicians, and have got\r\nin by corrupt rings and electioneering, not capacity or desert. I have\r\nnoticed how the millions of sturdy farmers and mechanics are thus the\r\nhelpless supple-jacks of comparatively few politicians. And I have\r\nnoticed more and more, the alarming spectacle of parties usurping the\r\ngovernment, and openly and shamelessly wielding it for party purposes.\"\r\n\r\nSad, serious, deep truths. Yet are there other, still deeper, amply\r\nconfronting, dominating truths. Over those politicians and great and\r\nlittle rings, and over all their insolence and wiles, and over the\r\npowerfulest parties, looms a power, too sluggish maybe, but ever holding\r\ndecisions and decrees in hand, ready, with stern process, to execute\r\nthem as soon as plainly needed--and at times, indeed, summarily crushing\r\nto atoms the mightiest parties, even in the hour of their pride.\r\n\r\nIn saner hours far different are the amounts of these things from what,\r\nat first sight, they appear. Though it is no doubt important who\r\nis elected governor, mayor, or legislator, (and full of dismay when\r\nincompetent or vile ones get elected, as they sometimes do,) there are\r\nother, quieter contingencies, infinitely more important. Shams, &c.,\r\nwill always be the show, like ocean's scum; enough, if waters deep and\r\nclear make up the rest. Enough, that while the piled embroider'd shoddy\r\ngaud and fraud spreads to the superficial eye, the hidden warp and weft\r\nare genuine, and will wear forever. Enough, in short, that the race,\r\nthe land which could raise such as the late rebellion, could also put it\r\ndown. The average man of a land at last only is important. He, in these\r\nStates, remains immortal owner and boss, deriving good uses, somehow,\r\nout of any sort of servant in office, even the basest; (certain\r\nuniversal requisites, and their settled regularity and protection, being\r\nfirst secured,) a nation like ours, in a sort of geological formation\r\nstate, trying continually new experiments, choosing new delegations,\r\nis not served by the best men only, but sometimes more by those that\r\nprovoke it--by the combats they arouse. Thus national rage, fury,\r\ndiscussions, &c., better than content. Thus, also, the warning signals,\r\ninvaluable for after times.\r\n\r\nWhat is more dramatic than the spectacle we have seen repeated, and\r\ndoubtless long shall see--the popular judgment taking the successful\r\ncandidates on trial in the offices--standing off, as it were, and\r\nobserving them and their doings for a while, and always giving, finally,\r\nthe fit, exactly due reward? I think, after all, the sublimest part of\r\npolitical history, and its culmination, is currently issuing from\r\nthe American people. I know nothing grander, better exercise, better\r\ndigestion, more positive proof of the past, the triumphant result of\r\nfaith in human-kind, than a well-contested American national election.\r\n\r\nThen still the thought returns, (like the thread-passage in overtures,)\r\ngiving the key and echo to these pages. When I pass to and fro,\r\ndifferent latitudes, different seasons, beholding the crowds of the\r\ngreat cities, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Chicago, St.\r\nLouis, San Francisco, New Orleans, Baltimore--when I mix with these\r\ninterminable swarms of alert, turbulent, good-natured, independent\r\ncitizens, mechanics, clerks, young persons--at the idea of this mass\r\nof men, so fresh and free, so loving and so proud, a singular awe falls\r\nupon me. I feel, with dejection and amazement, that among our geniuses\r\nand talented writers or speakers, few or none have yet really spoken to\r\nthis people, created a single image-making work for them, or absorb'd\r\nthe central spirit and the idiosyncrasies which are theirs--and\r\nwhich, thus, in highest ranges, so far remain entirely uncelebrated,\r\nunexpress'd.\r\n\r\nDominion strong is the body's; dominion stronger is the mind's. What\r\nhas fill'd, and fills to-day our intellect, our fancy, furnishing the\r\nstandards therein, is yet foreign. The great poems, Shakspere included,\r\nare poisonous to the idea of the pride and dignity of the common people,\r\nthe life-blood of democracy. The models of our literature, as we get\r\nit from other lands, ultra-marine, have had their birth in courts, and\r\nbask'd and grown in castle sunshine; all smells of princes' favors. Of\r\nworkers of a certain sort, we have, indeed, plenty, contributing after\r\ntheir kind; many elegant, many learn'd, all complacent. But touch'd by\r\nthe national test, or tried by the standards of democratic personality,\r\nthey wither to ashes. I say I have not seen a single writer, artist,\r\nlecturer, or what-not, that has confronted the voiceless but ever erect\r\nand active, pervading, underlying will and typic aspiration of the\r\nland, in a spirit kindred to itself. Do you call those genteel little\r\ncreatures American poets? Do you term that perpetual, pistareen,\r\npaste-pot work, American art, American drama, taste, verse? I think I\r\nhear, echoed as from some mountain-top afar in the west, the scornful\r\nlaugh of the Genius of these States.\r\n\r\nDemocracy, in silence, biding its time, ponders its own ideals, not of\r\nliterature and art only--not of men only, but of women. The idea of the\r\nwomen of America, (extricated from this daze, this fossil and unhealthy\r\nair which hangs about the word _lady_,) develop'd, raised to become the\r\nrobust equals, workers, and, it may be, even practical and political\r\ndeciders with the men--greater than man, we may admit, through their\r\ndivine maternity, always their towering, emblematical attribute--but\r\ngreat, at any rate, as man, in all departments; or, rather, capable of\r\nbeing so, soon as they realize it, and can bring themselves to give up\r\ntoys and fictions, and launch forth, as men do, amid real, independent,\r\nstormy life.\r\n\r\nThen, as towards our thought's finalé, (and, in that, overarching the\r\ntrue scholar's lesson,) we have to say there can be no complete or\r\nepical presentation of democracy in the aggregate, or anything like it,\r\nat this day, because its doctrines will only be effectually incarnated\r\nin any one branch, when, in all, their spirit is at the root and centre.\r\nFar, far, indeed, stretch, in distance, our Vistas! How much is still\r\nto be disentangled, freed! How long it takes to make this American world\r\nsee that it is, in itself, the final authority and reliance!\r\n\r\nDid you, too, O friend, suppose democracy was only for elections, for\r\npolitics, and for a party name? I say democracy is only of use there\r\nthat it may pass on and come to its flower and fruits in manners, in\r\nthe highest forms of interaction between men, and their beliefs--in\r\nreligion, literature, colleges, and schools--democracy in all public and\r\nprivate life, and in the army and navy.[26] I have intimated that, as a\r\nparamount scheme, it has yet few or no full realizers and believers.\r\nI do not see, either, that it owes any serious thanks to noted\r\npropagandists or champions, or has been essentially help'd, though often\r\nharm'd, by them. It has been and is carried on by all the moral forces,\r\nand by trade, finance, machinery, intercommunications, and, in fact,\r\nby all the developments of history, and can no more be stopp'd than the\r\ntides, or the earth in its orbit. Doubtless, also, it resides, crude and\r\nlatent, well down in the hearts of the fair average of the American-born\r\npeople, mainly in the agricultural regions. But it is not yet, there or\r\nanywhere, the fully-receiv'd, the fervid, the absolute faith.\r\n\r\nI submit, therefore, that the fruition of democracy, on aught like a\r\ngrand scale, resides altogether in the future. As, under any profound\r\nand comprehensive view of the gorgeous-composite feudal world, we see\r\nin it, through the long ages and cycles of ages, the results of a deep,\r\nintegral, human and divine principle, or fountain, from which issued\r\nlaws, ecclesia, manners, institutes, costumes, personalities, poems,\r\n(hitherto unequall'd,) faithfully partaking of their source, and\r\nindeed only arising either to betoken it, or to furnish parts of that\r\nvaried-flowing display, whose centre was one and absolute--so, long\r\nages hence, shall the due historian or critic make at least an equal\r\nretrospect, an equal history for the democratic principle. It too must\r\nbe adorn'd, credited with its results--then, when it, with imperial\r\npower, through amplest time, has dominated mankind--has been the source\r\nand test of all the moral, esthetic, social, political, and religious\r\nexpressions and institutes of the civilized world--has begotten them\r\nin spirit and in form, and has carried them to its own unprecedented\r\nheights--has had, (it is possible,) monastics and ascetics, more\r\nnumerous, more devout than the monks and priests of all previous\r\ncreeds--has sway'd the ages with a breadth and rectitude tallying\r\nNature's own--has fashion'd, systematized, and triumphantly finish'd and\r\ncarried out, in its own interest, and with unparallel'd success, a new\r\nearth and a new man.\r\n\r\nThus we presume to write, as it were, upon things that exist not, and\r\ntravel by maps yet unmade, and a blank. But the throes of birth are\r\nupon us; and we have something of this advantage in seasons of strong\r\nformations, doubts, suspense--for then the afflatus of such themes haply\r\nmay fall upon us, more or less; and then, hot from surrounding war and\r\nrevolution, our speech, though without polish'd coherence, and a failure\r\nby the standard called criticism, comes forth, real at least as the\r\nlightnings.\r\n\r\nAnd may-be we, these days, have, too, our own reward--(for there are yet\r\nsome, in all lands, worthy to be so encouraged.) Though not for us the\r\njoy of entering at the last the conquer'd city--not ours the chance ever\r\nto see with our own eyes the peerless power and splendid _eclat_ of\r\nthe democratic principle, arriv'd at meridian, filling the world with\r\neffulgence and majesty far beyond those of past history's kings, or\r\nall dynastic sway--there is yet, to whoever is eligible among us, the\r\nprophetic vision, the joy of being toss'd in the brave turmoil of these\r\ntimes--the promulgation and the path, obedient, lowly reverent to the\r\nvoice, the gesture of the god, or holy ghost, which others see not, hear\r\nnot--with the proud consciousness that amid whatever clouds, seductions,\r\nor heart-wearying postponements, we have never deserted, never\r\ndespair'd, never abandon'd the faith.\r\n\r\nSo much contributed, to be conn'd well, to help prepare and brace our\r\nedifice, our plann'd Idea--we still proceed to give it in another of its\r\naspects--perhaps the main, the high façade of all. For to democracy,\r\nthe leveler, the unyielding principle of the average, is surely join'd\r\nanother principle, equally unyielding, closely tracking the first,\r\nindispensable to it, opposite, (as the sexes are opposite,) and whose\r\nexistence, confronting and ever modifying the other, often clashing,\r\nparadoxical, yet neither of highest avail without the other,\r\nplainly supplies to these grand cosmic politics of ours, and to the\r\nlaunch'd-forth mortal dangers of republicanism, to-day or any day, the\r\ncounterpart and offset whereby Nature restrains the deadly original\r\nrelentlessness of all her first-class laws. This second principle is\r\nindividuality, the pride and centripetal isolation of a human being in\r\nhimself--identity--personalism. Whatever the name, its acceptance and\r\nthorough infusion through the organizations of political commonalty now\r\nshooting Aurora-like about the world, are of utmost importance, as the\r\nprinciple itself is needed for very life's sake. It forms, in a sort,\r\nor is to form, the compensating balance-wheel of the successful working\r\nmachinery of aggregate America.\r\n\r\nAnd, if we think of it, what does civilization itself rest upon--and\r\nwhat object has it, with its religions, arts, schools, &c., but rich,\r\nluxuriant, varied personalism? To that, all bends; and it is because\r\ntoward such result democracy alone, on anything like Nature's scale,\r\nbreaks up the limitless fallows of humankind, and plants the seed, and\r\ngives fair play, that its claims now precede the rest. The literature,\r\nsongs, esthetics, &c., of a country are of importance principally\r\nbecause they furnish the materials and suggestions of personality\r\nfor the women and men of that country, and enforce them in a thousand\r\neffective ways.[27] As the topmost claim of a strong consolidating\r\nof the nationality of these States, is, that only by such powerful\r\ncompaction can the separate States secure that full and free swing\r\nwithin their spheres, which is becoming to them, each after its kind,\r\nso will individuality, with unimpeded branchings, flourish best under\r\nimperial republican forms.\r\n\r\nAssuming Democracy to be at present in its embryo condition, and that\r\nthe only large and satisfactory justification of it resides in the\r\nfuture, mainly through the copious production of perfect characters\r\namong the people, and through the advent of a sane and pervading\r\nreligiousness, it is with regard to the atmosphere and spaciousness\r\nfit for such characters, and of certain nutriment and cartoon-draftings\r\nproper for them, and indicating them for New-World purposes, that\r\nI continue the present statement--an exploration, as of new ground,\r\nwherein, like other primitive surveyors, I must do the best I can,\r\nleaving it to those who come after me to do much better. (The service,\r\nin fact, if any, must be to break a sort of first path or track, no\r\nmatter how rude and ungeometrical.)\r\n\r\nWe have frequently printed the word Democracy. Yet I cannot too often\r\nrepeat that it is a word the real gist of which still sleeps, quite\r\nunawaken'd, notwithstanding the resonance and the many angry tempests\r\nout of which its syllables have come, from pen or tongue. It is a great\r\nword, whose history, I suppose, remains unwritten, because that history\r\nhas yet to be enacted. It is, in some sort, younger brother of another\r\ngreat and often-used word, Nature, whose history also waits unwritten.\r\nAs I perceive, the tendencies of our day, in the States, (and I entirely\r\nrespect them,) are toward those vast and sweeping movements, influences,\r\nmoral and physical, of humanity, now and always current over the planet,\r\non the scale of the impulses of the elements. Then it is also good to\r\nreduce the whole matter to the consideration of a single self, a man, a\r\nwoman, on permanent grounds. Even for the treatment of the universal, in\r\npolitics, metaphysics, or anything, sooner or later we come down to one\r\nsingle, solitary soul.\r\n\r\nThere is, in sanest hours, a consciousness, a thought that rises,\r\nindependent, lifted out from all else, calm, like the stars, shining\r\neternal. This is the thought of identity--yours for you, whoever\r\nyou are, as mine for me. Miracle of miracles, beyond statement, most\r\nspiritual and vaguest of earth's dreams, yet hardest basic fact, and\r\nonly entrance to all facts. In such devout hours, in the midst of the\r\nsignificant wonders of heaven and earth, (significant only because of\r\nthe Me in the centre,) creeds, conventions, fall away and become of no\r\naccount before this simple idea. Under the luminousness of real vision,\r\nit alone takes possession, takes value. Like the shadowy dwarf in the\r\nfable, 'once liberated and look'd upon, it expands over the whole earth,\r\nand spreads to the roof of heaven.\r\n\r\nThe quality of BEING, in the object's self, according to its own central\r\nidea and purpose, and of growing therefrom and thereto--not criticism by\r\nother standards, and adjustments thereto--is the lesson of Nature.\r\nTrue, the full man wisely gathers, culls, absorbs; but if, engaged\r\ndisproportionately in that, he slights or overlays the precious\r\nidiocrasy and special nativity and intention that he is, the man's self,\r\nthe main thing, is a failure, however wide his general cultivation.\r\nThus, in our times, refinement and delicatesse are not only attended\r\nto sufficiently, but threaten to eat us up, like a cancer. Already, the\r\ndemocratic genius watches, ill-pleased, these tendencies. Provision for\r\na little healthy rudeness, savage virtue, justification of what one has\r\nin one's self, whatever it is, is demanded. Negative qualities, even\r\ndeficiencies, would be a relief. Singleness and normal simplicity\r\nand separation, amid this more and more complex, more and more\r\nartificialized state of society--how pensively we yearn for them! how we\r\nwould welcome their return!\r\n\r\nIn some such direction, then--at any rate enough to preserve the\r\nbalance--we feel called upon to throw what weight we can, not for\r\nabsolute reasons, but current ones. To prune, gather, trim, conform, and\r\never cram and stuff, and be genteel and proper, is the pressure of our\r\ndays. While aware that much can be said even in behalf of all this,\r\nwe perceive that we have not now to consider the question of what\r\nis demanded to serve a half-starved and barbarous nation, or set of\r\nnations, but what is most applicable, most pertinent, for numerous\r\ncongeries of conventional, over-corpulent societies, already becoming\r\nstifled and rotten with flatulent, infidelistic literature, and polite\r\nconformity and art. In addition to establish'd sciences, we suggest a\r\nscience as it were of healthy average personalism, on original-universal\r\ngrounds, the object of which should be to raise up and supply through\r\nthe States a copious race of superb American men and women, cheerful,\r\nreligious, ahead of any yet known.\r\n\r\nAmerica has yet morally and artistically originated nothing. She seems\r\nsingularly unaware that the models of persons, books, manners, &c.,\r\nappropriate for former conditions and for European lands, are but exiles\r\nand exotics here. No current of her life, as shown on the surfaces of\r\nwhat is authoritatively called her society, accepts or runs into social\r\nor esthetic democracy; but all the currents set squarely against it.\r\nNever, in the Old World, was thoroughly upholster'd exterior appearance\r\nand show, mental and other, built entirely on the idea of caste, and on\r\nthe sufficiency of mere outside acquisition--never were glibness, verbal\r\nintellect, more the test, the emulation--more loftily elevated as head\r\nand sample--than they are on the surface of our republican States this\r\nday. The writers of a time hint the mottoes of its gods. The word of the\r\nmodern, say these voices, is the word Culture.\r\n\r\nWe find ourselves abruptly in close quarters with the enemy. This word\r\nCulture, or what it has come to represent, involves, by contrast, our\r\nwhole theme, and has been, indeed, the spur, urging us to engagement.\r\nCertain questions arise. As now taught, accepted and carried out, are\r\nnot the processes of culture rapidly creating a class of supercilious\r\ninfidels, who believe in nothing? Shall a man lose himself in countless\r\nmasses of adjustments, and be so shaped with reference to this, that,\r\nand the other, that the simply good and healthy and brave parts of him\r\nare reduced and clipp'd away, like the bordering of box in a garden? You\r\ncan cultivate corn and roses and orchards--but who shall cultivate the\r\nmountain peaks, the ocean, and the tumbling gorgeousness of the clouds?\r\nLastly--is the readily-given reply that culture only seeks to help,\r\nsystematize, and put in attitude, the elements of fertility and power, a\r\nconclusive reply?\r\n\r\nI do not so much object to the name, or word, but I should certainly\r\ninsist, for the purposes of these States, on a radical change of\r\ncategory, in the distribution of precedence. I should demand a programme\r\nof culture, drawn out, not for a single class alone, or for the parlors\r\nor lecture-rooms, but with an eye to practical life, the west, the\r\nworking-men, the facts of farms and jack-planes and engineers, and of\r\nthe broad range of the women also of the middle and working strata,\r\nand with reference to the perfect equality of women, and of a grand and\r\npowerful motherhood. I should demand of this programme or theory a scope\r\ngenerous enough to include the widest human area. It must have for its\r\nspinal meaning the formation of a typical personality of character,\r\neligible to the uses of the high average of men--and _not_ restricted\r\nby conditions ineligible to the masses. The best culture will always be\r\nthat of the manly and courageous instincts, and loving perceptions, and\r\nof self-respect--aiming to form, over this continent, an idiocrasy\r\nof universalism, which, true child of America, will bring joy to its\r\nmother, returning to her in her own spirit, recruiting myriads of\r\noffspring, able, natural, perceptive, tolerant, devout believers in\r\nher, America, and with some definite instinct why and for what she has\r\narisen, most vast, most formidable of historic births, and is, now and\r\nhere, with wonderful step, journeying through Time.\r\n\r\nThe problem, as it seems to me, presented to the New World, is,\r\nunder permanent law and order, and after preserving cohesion,\r\n(ensemble-individuality,) at all hazards, to vitalize man's free play of\r\nspecial Personalism, recognizing in it something that calls ever more\r\nto be consider'd, fed, and adopted as the substratum for the best\r\nthat belongs to us, (government indeed is for it,) including the new\r\nesthetics of our future.\r\n\r\nTo formulate beyond this present vagueness--to help line and put\r\nbefore us the species, or a specimen of the species, of the democratic\r\nethnology of the future, is a work toward which the genius of our land,\r\nwith peculiar encouragement, invites her well-wishers. Already certain\r\nlimnings, more or less grotesque, more or less fading and watery, have\r\nappear'd. We too, (repressing doubts and qualms,) will try our hand.\r\n\r\nAttempting, then, however crudely, a basic model or portrait of\r\npersonality for general use for the manliness of the States, (and\r\ndoubtless that is most useful which is most simple and comprehensive\r\nfor all, and toned low enough,) we should prepare the canvas well\r\nbeforehand. Parentage must consider itself in advance. (Will the time\r\nhasten when fatherhood and motherhood shall become a science--and the\r\nnoblest science?) To our model, a clear-blooded, strong-fibred\r\nphysique, is indispensable; the questions of food, drink, air, exercise,\r\nassimilation, digestion, can never be intermitted. Out of these we\r\ndescry a well-begotten selfhood--in youth, fresh, ardent, emotional,\r\naspiring, full of adventure; at maturity, brave, perceptive, under\r\ncontrol, neither too talkative nor too reticent, neither flippant nor\r\nsombre; of the bodily figure, the movements easy, the complexion showing\r\nthe best blood, somewhat flush'd, breast expanded, an erect attitude,\r\na voice whose sound outvies music, eyes of calm and steady gaze, yet\r\ncapable also of flashing--and a general presence that holds its own\r\nin the company of the highest. (For it is native personality, and that\r\nalone, that endows a man to stand before presidents or generals, or in\r\nany distinguish'd collection, with _aplomb_--and _not_ culture, or any\r\nknowledge or intellect whatever.) With regard to the mental-educational\r\npart of our model, enlargement of intellect, stores of cephalic\r\nknowledge, &c., the concentration thitherward of all the customs of our\r\nage, especially in America, is so overweening, and provides so fully\r\nfor that part, that, important and necessary as it is, it really needs\r\nnothing from us here--except, indeed, a phrase of warning and restraint.\r\nManners, costumes, too, though important, we need not dwell upon here.\r\nLike beauty, grace of motion, &c., they are results. Causes, original\r\nthings, being attended to, the right manners unerringly follow. Much\r\nis said, among artists, of \"the grand style,\" as if it were a thing by\r\nitself. When a man, artist or whoever, has health, pride, acuteness,\r\nnoble aspirations, he has the motive-elements of the grandest style. The\r\nrest is but manipulation, (yet that is no small matter.)\r\n\r\nLeaving still unspecified several sterling parts of any model fit for\r\nthe future personality of America, I must not fail, again and ever,\r\nto pronounce myself on one, probably the least attended to in modern\r\ntimes--a hiatus, indeed, threatening its gloomiest consequences after\r\nus. I mean the simple, unsophisticated Conscience, the primary moral\r\nelement. If I were asked to specify in what quarter lie the grounds of\r\ndarkest dread, respecting the America of our hopes, I should have to\r\npoint to this particular. I should demand the invariable application to\r\nindividuality, this day and any day, of that old, ever-true plumb-rule\r\nof persons, eras, nations. Our triumphant modern civilizee, with his\r\nall-schooling and his wondrous appliances, will still show himself but\r\nan amputation while this deficiency remains. Beyond, (assuming a more\r\nhopeful tone,) the vertebration of the manly and womanly personalism\r\nof our western world, can only be, and is, indeed, to be, (I hope,) its\r\nall-penetrating Religiousness.\r\n\r\nThe ripeness of Religion is doubtless to be looked for in this field of\r\nindividuality, and is a result that no organization or church can\r\never achieve. As history is poorly retain'd by what the technists call\r\nhistory, and is not given out from their pages, except the learner\r\nhas in himself the sense of the well-wrapt, never yet written, perhaps\r\nimpossible to be written, history--so Religion, although casually\r\narrested, and, after a fashion, preserv'd in the churches and creeds,\r\ndoes not depend at all upon them, but is a part of the identified\r\nsoul, which, when greatest, knows not bibles in the old way, but in new\r\nways--the identified soul, which can really confront Religion when it\r\nextricates itself entirely from the churches, and not before.\r\n\r\nPersonalism fuses this, and favors it. I should say, indeed, that only\r\nin the perfect uncontamination and solitariness of individuality may the\r\nspirituality of religion positively come forth at all. Only here, and on\r\nsuch terms, the meditation, the devout ecstasy, the soaring flight.\r\nOnly here, communion with the mysteries, the eternal problems, whence?\r\nwhither? Alone, and identity, and the mood--and the soul emerges, and\r\nall statements, churches, sermons, melt away like vapors. Alone,\r\nand silent thought and awe, and aspiration--and then the interior\r\nconsciousness, like a hitherto unseen inscription, in magic ink, beams\r\nout its wondrous lines to the sense. Bibles may convey, and priests\r\nexpound, but it is exclusively for the noiseless operation of one's\r\nisolated Self, to enter the pure ether of veneration, reach the divine\r\nlevels, and commune with the unutterable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo practically enter into politics is an important part of American\r\npersonalism. To every young man, north and south, earnestly studying\r\nthese things, I should here, as an offset to what I have said in former\r\npages, now also say, that may be to views of very largest scope, after\r\nall, perhaps the political, (perhaps the literary and sociological,)\r\nAmerica goes best about its development its own way--sometimes, to\r\ntemporary sight, appaling enough. It is the fashion among dillettants\r\nand fops (perhaps I myself am not guiltless,) to decry the whole\r\nformulation of the active politics of America, as beyond redemption, and\r\nto be carefully kept away from. See you that you do not fall into\r\nthis error. America, it may be, is doing very well upon the whole,\r\nnotwithstanding these antics of the parties and their leaders, these\r\nhalf-brain'd nominees, the many ignorant ballots, and many elected\r\nfailures and blatherers. It is the dillettants, and all who shirk their\r\nduty, who are not doing well. As for you, I advise you to enter more\r\nstrongly yet into politics. I advise every young man to do so. Always\r\ninform yourself; always do the best you can; always vote. Disengage\r\nyourself from parties. They have been useful, and to some extent remain\r\nso; but the floating, uncommitted electors, farmers, clerks, mechanics,\r\nthe masters of parties--watching aloof, inclining victory this side\r\nor that side--such are the ones most needed, present and future. For\r\nAmerica, if eligible at all to downfall and ruin, is eligible within\r\nherself, not without; for I see clearly that the combined foreign world\r\ncould not beat her down. But these savage, wolfish parties alarm me.\r\nOwning no law but their own will, more and more combative, less and less\r\ntolerant of the idea of ensemble and of equal brotherhood, the perfect\r\nequality of the States, the ever-overarching American ideas, it behooves\r\nyou to convey yourself implicitly to no party, nor submit blindly to\r\ntheir dictators, but steadily hold yourself judge and master over all of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSo much, (hastily toss'd together, and leaving far more unsaid,) for\r\nan ideal, or intimations of an ideal, toward American manhood. But the\r\nother sex, in our land, requires at least a basis of suggestion.\r\n\r\nI have seen a young American woman, one of a large family of daughters,\r\nwho, some years since, migrated from her meagre country home to one of\r\nthe northern cities, to gain her own support. She soon became an expert\r\nseamstress, but finding the employment too confining for health and\r\ncomfort, she went boldly to work for others, to house-keep, cook, clean,\r\n&c. After trying several places, she fell upon one where she was suited.\r\nShe has told me that she finds nothing degrading in her position; it is\r\nnot inconsistent with personal dignity, self-respect, and the respect of\r\nothers. She confers benefits and receives them. She has good health; her\r\npresence itself is healthy and bracing; her character is unstain'd; she\r\nhas made herself understood, and preserves her independence, and has\r\nbeen able to help her parents, and educate and get places for her\r\nsisters; and her course of life is not without opportunities for mental\r\nimprovement, and of much quiet, uncosting happiness and love.\r\n\r\nI have seen another woman who, from taste and necessity conjoin'd, has\r\ngone into practical affairs, carries on a mechanical business, partly\r\nworks at it herself, dashes out more and more into real hardy life, is\r\nnot abash'd by the coarseness of the contact, knows how to be firm\r\nand silent at the same time, holds her own with unvarying coolness and\r\ndecorum, and will compare, any day, with superior carpenters, farmers,\r\nand even boatmen and drivers. For all that, she has not lost the charm\r\nof the womanly nature, but preserves and bears it fully, though through\r\nsuch rugged presentation.\r\n\r\nThen there is the wife of a mechanic, mother of two children, a woman of\r\nmerely passable English education, but of fine wit, with all her\r\nsex's grace and intuitions, who exhibits, indeed, such a noble female\r\npersonality, that I am fain to record it here. Never abnegating her own\r\nproper independence, but always genially preserving it, and what\r\nbelongs to it--cooking, washing, child-nursing, house-tending--she\r\nbeams sunshine out of all these duties, and makes them illustrious.\r\nPhysiologically sweet and sound, loving work, practical, she yet knows\r\nthat there are intervals, however few, devoted to recreation, music,\r\nleisure, hospitality--and affords such intervals. Whatever she does,\r\nand wherever she is, that charm, that indescribable perfume of genuine\r\nwomanhood attends her, goes with her, exhales from her, which belongs of\r\nright to all the sex, and is, or ought to be, the invariable atmosphere\r\nand common aureola of old as well as young.\r\n\r\nMy dear mother once described to me a resplendent person, down on Long\r\nIsland, whom she knew in early days. She was known by the name of the\r\nPeacemaker. She was well toward eighty years old, of happy and sunny\r\ntemperament, had always lived on a farm, and was very neighborly,\r\nsensible and discreet, an invariable and welcom'd favorite, especially\r\nwith young married women. She had numerous children and grandchildren.\r\nShe was uneducated, but possess'd a native dignity. She had come to be a\r\ntacitly agreed upon domestic regulator, judge, settler of difficulties,\r\nshepherdess, and reconciler in the land. She was a sight to draw near\r\nand look upon, with her large figure, her profuse snow-white hair,\r\n(uncoil'd by any head-dress or cap,) dark eyes, clear complexion, sweet\r\nbreath, and peculiar personal magnetism.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing portraits, I admit, are frightfully out of line from these\r\nimported models of womanly personality--the stock feminine characters of\r\nthe current novelists, or of the foreign court poems, (Ophelias, Enids,\r\nprincesses, or ladies of one thing or another,) which fill the envying\r\ndreams of so many poor girls, and are accepted by our men, too, as\r\nsupreme ideals of feminine excellence to be sought after. But I present\r\nmine just for a change.\r\n\r\nThen there are mutterings, (we will not now stop to heed them here, but\r\nthey must be heeded,) of something more revolutionary. The day is coming\r\nwhen the deep questions of woman's entrance amid the arenas of practical\r\nlife, politics, the suffrage, &c., will not only be argued all around\r\nus, but may be put to decision, and real experiment.\r\n\r\nOf course, in these States, for both man and woman, we must entirely\r\nrecast the types of highest personality from what the oriental, feudal,\r\necclesiastical worlds bequeath us, and which yet possess the imaginative\r\nand esthetic fields of the United States, pictorial and melodramatic,\r\nnot without use as studies, but making sad work, and forming a strange\r\nanachronism upon the scenes and exigencies around us. Of course, the old\r\nundying elements remain. The task is, to successfully adjust them to new\r\ncombinations, our own days. Nor is this so incredible. I can conceive a\r\ncommunity, to-day and here, in which, on a sufficient scale, the\r\nperfect personalities, without noise meet; say in some pleasant western\r\nsettlement or town, where a couple of hundred best men and women, of\r\nordinary worldly status, have by luck been drawn together, with nothing\r\nextra of genius or wealth, but virtuous, chaste, industrious, cheerful,\r\nresolute, friendly and devout. I can conceive such a community organized\r\nin running order, powers judiciously delegated--farming, building,\r\ntrade, courts, mails, schools, elections, all attended to; and then the\r\nrest of life, the main thing, freely branching and blossoming in each\r\nindividual, and bearing golden fruit. I can see there, in every young\r\nand old man, after his kind, and in every woman after hers, a true\r\npersonality, develop'd, exercised proportionately in body, mind,\r\nand spirit. I can imagine this case as one not necessarily rare or\r\ndifficult, but in buoyant accordance with the municipal and general\r\nrequirements of our times. And I can realize in it the culmination\r\nof something better than any stereotyped _eclat_ of history or poems.\r\nPerhaps, unsung, undramatized, unput in essays or biographies--perhaps\r\neven some such community already exists, in Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, or\r\nsomewhere, practically fulfilling itself, and thus outvying, in cheapest\r\nvulgar life, all that has been hitherto shown in best ideal pictures.\r\n\r\nIn short, and to sum up, America, betaking herself to formative\r\naction, (as it is about time for more solid achievement, and less\r\nwindy promise,) must, for her purposes, cease to recognize a theory of\r\ncharacter grown of feudal aristocracies, or form'd by merely literary\r\nstandards, or from any ultramarine, full-dress formulas of culture,\r\npolish, caste, &c., and must sternly promulgate her own new standard,\r\nyet old enough, and accepting the old, the perennial elements, and\r\ncombining them into groups, unities, appropriate to the modern, the\r\ndemocratic, the west, and to the practical occasions and needs of our\r\nown cities, and of the agricultural regions. Ever the most precious in\r\nthe common. Ever the fresh breeze of field, or hill, or lake, is\r\nmore than any palpitation of fans, though of ivory, and redolent with\r\nperfume; and the air is more than the costliest perfumes.\r\n\r\nAnd now, for fear of mistake, we may not intermit to beg our absolution\r\nfrom all that genuinely is, or goes along with, even Culture. Pardon us,\r\nvenerable shade! if we have seem'd to speak lightly of your office. The\r\nwhole civilization of the earth, we know, is yours, with all the glory\r\nand the light thereof. It is, indeed, in your own spirit, and seeking to\r\ntally the loftiest teachings of it, that we aim these poor utterances.\r\nFor you, too, mighty minister! know that there is something greater than\r\nyou, namely, the fresh, eternal qualities of Being. From them, and by\r\nthem, as you, at your best, we too evoke the last, the needed help, to\r\nvitalize our country and our days. Thus we pronounce not so much against\r\nthe principle of culture; we only supervise it, and promulge along with\r\nit, as deep, perhaps a deeper, principle. As we have shown the New World\r\nincluding in itself the all-leveling aggregate of democracy, we show\r\nit also including the all-varied, all-permitting, all-free theorem of\r\nindividuality, and erecting therefor a lofty and hitherto unoccupied\r\nframework or platform, broad enough for all, eligible to every farmer\r\nand mechanic--to the female equally with the male--a towering selfhood,\r\nnot physically perfect only--not satisfied with the mere mind's and\r\nlearning's stores, but religious, possessing the idea of the infinite,\r\n(rudder and compass sure amid this troublous voyage, o'er darkest,\r\nwildest wave, through stormiest wind, of man's or nation's\r\nprogress)--realizing, above the rest, that known humanity, in deepest\r\nsense, is fair adhesion to itself, for purposes beyond--and that,\r\nfinally, the personality of mortal life is most important with reference\r\nto the immortal, the unknown, the spiritual, the only permanently real,\r\nwhich as the ocean waits for and receives the rivers, waits for us each\r\nand all.\r\n\r\nMuch is there, yet, demanding line and outline in our Vistas, not only\r\non these topics, but others quite unwritten. Indeed, we could talk the\r\nmatter, and expand it, through lifetime. But it is necessary to return\r\nto our original premises. In view of them, we have again pointedly\r\nto confess that all the objective grandeurs of the world, for highest\r\npurposes, yield themselves up, and depend on mentality alone. Here, and\r\nhere only, all balances, all rests. For the mind, which alone builds\r\nthe permanent edifice, haughtily builds it to itself. By it, with\r\nwhat follows it, are convey'd to mortal sense the culminations of\r\nthe materialistic, the known, and a prophecy of the unknown. To\r\ntake expression, to incarnate, to endow a literature with grand and\r\narchetypal models--to fill with pride and love the utmost capacity, and\r\nto achieve spiritual meanings, and suggest the future--these, and these\r\nonly, satisfy the soul. We must not say one word against real materials;\r\nbut the wise know that they do not become real till touched by emotions,\r\nthe mind. Did we call the latter imponderable? Ah, let us rather\r\nproclaim that the slightest song-tune, the countless ephemera of\r\npassions arous'd by orators and tale-tellers, are more dense, more\r\nweighty than the engines there in the great factories, or the granite\r\nblocks in their foundations.\r\n\r\nApproaching thus the momentous spaces, and considering with reference to\r\na new and greater personalism, the needs and possibilities of American\r\nimaginative literature, through the medium-light of what we have already\r\nbroach'd, it will at once be appreciated that a vast gulf of difference\r\nseparates the present accepted condition of these spaces, inclusive of\r\nwhat is floating in them, from any condition adjusted to, or fit for,\r\nthe world, the America, there sought to be indicated, and the copious\r\nraces of complete men and women, along these Vistas crudely outlined.\r\nIt is, in some sort, no less a difference than lies between that\r\nlong-continued nebular state and vagueness of the astronomical worlds,\r\ncompared with the subsequent state, the definitely-form'd worlds\r\nthemselves, duly compacted, clustering in systems, hung up there,\r\nchandeliers of the universe, beholding and mutually lit by each other's\r\nlights, serving for ground of all substantial foothold, all vulgar\r\nuses--yet serving still more as an undying chain and echelon of\r\nspiritual proofs and shows. A boundless field to fill! A new creation,\r\nwith needed orbic works launch'd forth, to revolve in free and lawful\r\ncircuits--to move, self-poised, through the ether, and shine like\r\nheaven's own suns! With such, and nothing less, we suggest that New\r\nWorld literature, fit to rise upon, cohere, and signalize in time, these\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nWhat, however, do we more definitely mean by New World literature? Are\r\nwe not doing well enough here already? Are not the United States this\r\nday busily using, working, more printer's type, more presses, than any\r\nother country? uttering and absorbing more publications than any other?\r\nDo not our publishers fatten quicker and deeper? (helping themselves,\r\nunder shelter of a delusive and sneaking law, or rather absence of law,\r\nto most of their forage, poetical, pictorial, historical, romantic,\r\neven comic, without money and without price--and fiercely resisting\r\nthe timidest proposal to pay for it.) Many will come under this\r\ndelusion--but my purpose is to dispel it. I say that a nation may\r\nhold and circulate rivers and oceans of very readable print, journals,\r\nmagazines, novels, library-books, \"poetry,\" &c.--such as the States\r\nto-day possess and circulate--of unquestionable aid and value--hundreds\r\nof new volumes annually composed and brought out here, respectable\r\nenough, indeed unsurpass'd in smartness and erudition--with\r\nfurther hundreds, or rather millions, (as by free forage or theft\r\naforemention'd,) also thrown into the market--and yet, all the while,\r\nthe said nation, land, strictly speaking, may possess no literature at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nRepeating our inquiry, what, then, do we mean by real literature?\r\nespecially the democratic literature of the future? Hard questions to\r\nmeet. The clues are inferential, and turn us to the past. At best, we\r\ncan only offer suggestions, comparisons, circuits.\r\n\r\nIt must still be reiterated, as, for the purpose of these memoranda, the\r\ndeep lesson of history and time, that all else in the contributions of\r\na nation or age, through its politics, materials, heroic personalities,\r\nmilitary eclat, &c., remains crude, and defers, in any close and\r\nthorough-going estimate, until vitalized by national, original\r\narchetypes in literature. They only put the nation in form, finally tell\r\nanything--prove, complete anything--perpetuate anything. Without doubt,\r\nsome of the richest and most powerful and populous communities of the\r\nantique world, and some of the grandest personalities and events, have,\r\nto after and present times, left themselves entirely unbequeath'd.\r\nDoubtless, greater than any that have come down to us, were among those\r\nlands, heroisms, persons, that have not come down to us at all, even\r\nby name, date, or location. Others have arrived safely, as from voyages\r\nover wide, century-stretching seas. The little ships, the miracles that\r\nhave buoy'd them, and by incredible chances safely convey'd them, (or\r\nthe best of them, their meaning and essence,) overlong wastes, darkness,\r\nlethargy, ignorance, &c., have been a few inscriptions--a few immortal\r\ncompositions, small in size, yet compassing what measureless values of\r\nreminiscence, contemporary portraitures, manners, idioms and beliefs,\r\nwith deepest inference, hint and thought, to tie and touch forever the\r\nold, new body, and the old, new soul! These! and still these! bearing\r\nthe freight so dear--dearer than pride--dearer than love. All the best\r\nexperience of humanity, folded, saved, freighted to us here. Some of\r\nthese tiny ships we call Old and New Testament, Homer, Eschylus, Plato,\r\nJuvenal, &c. Precious minims! I think, if we were forced to choose,\r\nrather than have you, and the likes of you, and what belongs to, and has\r\ngrown of you, blotted out and gone, we could better afford, appaling as\r\nthat would be, to lose all actual ships, this day fasten'd by wharf,\r\nor floating on wave, and see them, with all their cargoes, scuttled and\r\nsent to the bottom.\r\n\r\nGather'd by geniuses of city, race or age, and put by them in highest\r\nof art's forms, namely, the literary form, the peculiar combinations\r\nand the outshows of that city, age, or race, its particular modes of the\r\nuniversal attributes and passions, its faiths, heroes, lovers and gods,\r\nwars, traditions, struggles, crimes, emotions, joys, (or the subtle\r\nspirit of these,) having been pass'd on to us to illumine our own\r\nselfhood, and its experiences--what they supply, indispensable and\r\nhighest, if taken away, nothing else in all the world's boundless\r\nstore-houses could make up to us, or ever again return.\r\n\r\nFor us, along the great highways of time, those monuments stand--those\r\nforms of majesty and beauty. For us those beacons burn through all the\r\nnights. Unknown Egyptians, graving hieroglyphs; Hindus, with hymn and\r\napothegm and endless epic; Hebrew prophet, with spirituality, as in\r\nflashes of lightning, conscience like red-hot iron, plaintive songs and\r\nscreams of vengeance for tyrannies and enslavement; Christ, with bent\r\nhead, brooding love and peace, like a dove; Greek, creating eternal\r\nshapes of physical and esthetic proportion; Roman, lord of satire, the\r\nsword, and the codex;--of the figures, some far off and veil'd, others\r\nnearer and visible; Dante, stalking with lean form, nothing but fibre,\r\nnot a grain of superfluous flesh; Angelo, and the great painters,\r\narchitects, musicians; rich Shakspere, luxuriant as the sun, artist and\r\nsinger of feudalism in its sunset, with all the gorgeous colors, owner\r\nthereof, and using them at will; and so to such as German Kant and\r\nHegel, where they, though near us, leaping over the ages, sit again,\r\nimpassive, imperturbable, like the Egyptian gods. Of these, and the like\r\nof these, is it too much, indeed, to return to our favorite figure,\r\nand view them as orbs and systems of orbs, moving in free paths in the\r\nspaces of that other heaven, the kosmic intellect, the soul?\r\n\r\nYe powerful and resplendent ones! ye were, in your atmospheres, grown\r\nnot for America, but rather for her foes, the feudal and the old--while\r\nour genius is democratic and modern. Yet could ye, indeed, but breathe\r\nyour breath of life into our New World's nostrils--not to enslave us, as\r\nnow, but, for our needs, to breed a spirit like your own--perhaps, (dare\r\nwe to say it?) to dominate, even destroy, what you yourselves have left!\r\nOn your plane, and no less, but even higher and wider, must we mete\r\nand measure for to-day and here. I demand races of orbic bards, with\r\nunconditional uncompromising sway. Come forth, sweet democratic despots\r\nof the west!\r\n\r\nBy points like these we, in reflection, token what we mean by any land's\r\nor people's genuine literature. And thus compared and tested, judging\r\namid the influence of loftiest products only, what do our current\r\ncopious fields of print, covering in manifold forms, the United States,\r\nbetter, for an analogy, present, than, as in certain regions of the sea,\r\nthose spreading, undulating masses of squid, through which the whale\r\nswimming, with head half out, feeds?\r\n\r\nNot but that doubtless our current so-called literature, (like an\r\nendless supply of small coin,) performs a certain service, and may-be,\r\ntoo, the service needed for the time, (the preparation-service, as\r\nchildren learn to spell.) Everybody reads, and truly nearly everybody\r\nwrites, either books, or for the magazines or journals. The matter has\r\nmagnitude, too, after a sort. But is it really advancing? or, has it\r\nadvanced for a long while? There is something impressive about the huge\r\neditions of the dailies and weeklies, the mountain-stacks of white\r\npaper piled in the press-vaults, and the proud, crashing, ten-cylinder\r\npresses, which I can stand and watch any time by the half hour. Then,\r\n(though the States in the field of imagination present not a single\r\nfirst-class work, not a single great literatus,) the main objects,\r\nto amuse, to titillate, to pass away time, to circulate the news, and\r\nrumors of news, to rhyme and read rhyme, are yet attain'd, and on\r\na scale of infinity. To-day, in books, in the rivalry of writers,\r\nespecially novelists, success, (so-call'd,) is for him or her who\r\nstrikes the mean flat average, the sensational appetite for stimulus,\r\nincident, persiflage, &c., and depicts, to the common calibre, sensual,\r\nexterior life. To such, or the luckiest of them, as we see, the\r\naudiences are limitless and profitable; but they cease presently. While\r\nthis day, or any day, to workmen portraying interior or spiritual life,\r\nthe audiences were limited, and often laggard--but they last forever.\r\n\r\nCompared with the past, our modern science soars, and our journals\r\nserve--but ideal and even ordinary romantic literature, does not,\r\nI think, substantially advance. Behold the prolific brood of the\r\ncontemporary novel, magazine-tale, theatre-play, &c. The same endless\r\nthread of tangled and superlative love-story, inherited, apparently from\r\nthe Amadises and Palmerins of the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries over\r\nthere in Europe. The costumes and associations brought down to date, the\r\nseasoning hotter and more varied, the dragons and ogres left out--but\r\nthe _thing_, I should say, has not advanced--is just as sensational,\r\njust as strain'd--remains about the same, nor more, nor less.\r\n\r\nWhat is the reason our time, our lands, that we see no fresh local\r\ncourage, sanity, of our own--the Mississippi, stalwart Western men,\r\nreal mental and physical facts, Southerners, &c., in the body of our\r\nliterature? especially the poetic part of it. But always, instead, a\r\nparcel of dandies and ennuyees, dapper little gentlemen from abroad, who\r\nflood us with their thin sentiment of parlors, parasols, piano-songs,\r\ntinkling rhymes, the five-hundredth importation--or whimpering and\r\ncrying about something, chasing one aborted conceit after another,\r\nand forever occupied in dyspeptic amours with dyspeptic women. While,\r\ncurrent and novel, the grandest events and revolutions and stormiest\r\npassions of history, are crossing to-day with unparallel'd rapidity and\r\nmagnificence over the stages of our own and all the continents, offering\r\nnew materials, opening new vistas, with largest needs, inviting the\r\ndaring launching forth of conceptions in literature, inspired by them,\r\nsoaring in highest regions, serving art in its highest (which is only\r\nthe other name for serving God, and serving humanity,) where is the man\r\nof letters, where is the book, with any nobler aim than to follow in the\r\nold track, repeat what has been said before--and, as its utmost triumph,\r\nsell well, and be erudite or elegant?\r\n\r\nMark the roads, the processes, through which these States have arrived,\r\nstanding easy, henceforth ever-equal, ever-compact in their range\r\nto-day. European adventures? the most antique? Asiatic or African? old\r\nhistory--miracles--romances? Rather our own unquestion'd facts. They\r\nhasten, incredible, blazing bright as fire. From the deeds and days of\r\nColumbus down to the present, and including the present--and especially\r\nthe late secession war--when I con them, I feel, every leaf, like\r\nstopping to see if I have not made a mistake, and fall'n on the splendid\r\nfigments of some dream. But it is no dream. We stand, live, move, in\r\nthe huge flow of our age s materialism--in its spirituality. We have had\r\nfounded for us the most positive of lands. The founders have pass'd to\r\nother spheres--but what are these terrible duties they have left us?\r\n\r\nTheir politics the United States have, in my opinion, with all their\r\nfaults, already substantially establish'd, for good, on their own\r\nnative, sound, long-vista'd principles, never to be overturn'd, offering\r\na sure basis for all the rest. With that, their future religious forms\r\nsociology, literature, teachers, schools, costumes, &c., are of course\r\nto make a compact whole, uniform, on tallying principles. For how can\r\nwe remain, divided, contradicting ourselves, this way?[28] I say we can\r\nonly attain harmony and stability by consulting ensemble and the ethic\r\npurports, and faithfully building upon them. For the New World, indeed,\r\nafter two grand stages of preparation-strata, I perceive that now a\r\nthird stage, being ready for, (and without which the other two were\r\nuseless,) with unmistakable signs appears. The First stage was the\r\nplanning and putting on record the political foundation rights of\r\nimmense masses of people--indeed all people--in the organization of\r\nrepublican National, State, and municipal governments, all constructed\r\nwith reference to each, and each to all. This is the American programme,\r\nnot for classes, but for universal man, and is embodied in the compacts\r\nof the Declaration of Independence, and, as it began and has now\r\ngrown, with its amendments, the Federal Constitution--and in the State\r\ngovernments, with all their interiors, and with general suffrage; those\r\nhaving the sense not only of what is in themselves, but that their\r\ncertain several things started, planted, hundreds of others in the same\r\ndirection duly arise and follow. The Second stage relates to material\r\nprosperity, wealth, produce, labor-saving machines, iron, cotton, local,\r\nState and continental railways, intercommunication and trade with all\r\nlands, steamships, mining, general employment, organization of great\r\ncities, cheap appliances for comfort, numberless technical schools,\r\nbooks, newspapers, a currency for money circulation, &c. The\r\nThird stage, rising out of the previous ones, to make them and\r\nall illustrious, I, now, for one, promulge, announcing a native\r\nexpression-spirit, getting into form, adult, and through mentality, for\r\nthese States, self-contain'd, different from others, more expansive,\r\nmore rich and free, to be evidenced by original authors and poets\r\nto come, by American personalities, plenty of them, male and female,\r\ntraversing the States, none excepted--and by native superber\r\ntableaux and growths of language, songs, operas, orations, lectures,\r\narchitecture--and by a sublime and serious Religious Democracy sternly\r\ntaking command, dissolving the old, sloughing off surfaces, and from\r\nits own interior and vital principles, reconstructing, democratizing\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nFor America, type of progress, and of essential faith in man, above\r\nall his errors and wickedness--few suspect how deep, how deep it really\r\nstrikes. The world evidently supposes, and we have evidently supposed\r\nso too, that the States are merely to achieve the equal franchise, an\r\nelective government--to inaugurate the respectability of labor, and\r\nbecome a nation of practical operatives, law-abiding, orderly and well\r\noff. Yes, those are indeed parts of the task of America; but they\r\nnot only do not exhaust the progressive conception, but rather arise,\r\nteeming with it, as the mediums of deeper, higher progress. Daughter of\r\na physical revolution--mother of the true revolutions, which are of\r\nthe interior life, and of the arts. For so long as the spirit is not\r\nchanged, any change of appearance is of no avail.\r\n\r\nThe old men, I remember as a boy, were always talking of American\r\nindependence. What is independence? Freedom from all laws or bonds\r\nexcept those of one's own being, control'd by the universal ones. To\r\nlands, to man, to woman, what is there at last to each, but the inherent\r\nsoul, nativity, idiocrasy, free, highest-poised, soaring its own flight,\r\nfollowing out itself?\r\n\r\nAt present, these States, in their theology and social standards, (of\r\ngreater importance than their political institutions,) are entirely held\r\npossession of by foreign lands. We see the sons and daughters of the\r\nNew World, ignorant of its genius, not yet inaugurating the native, the\r\nuniversal, and the near, still importing the distant, the partial, and\r\nthe dead. We see London, Paris, Italy--not original, superb, as where\r\nthey belong--but second-hand here, where they do not belong. We see the\r\nshreds of Hebrews, Romans, Greeks; but where, on her own soil, do we\r\nsee, in any faithful, highest, proud expression, America herself? I\r\nsometimes question whether she has a corner in her own house.\r\n\r\nNot but that in one sense, and a very grand one, good theology, good\r\nart, or good literature, has certain features shared in common. The\r\ncombination fraternizes, ties the races--is, in many particulars, under\r\nlaws applicable indifferently to all, irrespective of climate or\r\ndate, and, from whatever source, appeals to emotions, pride, love,\r\nspirituality, common to human kind. Nevertheless, they touch a man\r\nclosest, (perhaps only actually touch him,) even in these, in their\r\nexpression through autochthonic lights and shades, flavors, fondnesses,\r\naversions, specific incidents, illustrations, out of his own\r\nnationality, geography, surroundings, antecedents, &c. The spirit and\r\nthe form are one, and depend far more on association, identity and\r\nplace, than is supposed. Subtly interwoven with the materiality\r\nand personality of a land, a race--Teuton, Turk, Californian, or\r\nwhat-not--there is always something--I can hardly tell what it\r\nis--history but describes the results of it--it is the same as the\r\nuntellable look of some human faces. Nature, too, in her stolid forms,\r\nis full of it--but to most it is there a secret. This something is\r\nrooted in the invisible roots, the profoundest meanings of that place,\r\nrace, or nationality; and to absorb and again effuse it, uttering words\r\nand products as from its midst, and carrying it into highest regions,\r\nis the work, or a main part of the work, of any country's true author,\r\npoet, historian, lecturer, and perhaps even priest and philosoph. Here,\r\nand here only, are the foundations for our really valuable and permanent\r\nverse, drama, &c.\r\n\r\nBut at present, (judged by any higher scale than that which finds the\r\nchief ends of existence to be to feverishly make money during one-half\r\nof it, and by some \"amusement,\" or perhaps foreign travel, flippantly\r\nkill time, the other half,) and consider'd with reference to purposes\r\nof patriotism, health, a noble personality, religion, and the democratic\r\nadjustments, all these swarms of poems, literary magazines, dramatic\r\nplays, resultant so far from American intellect, and the formation of\r\nour best ideas, are useless and a mockery. They strengthen and nourish\r\nno one, express nothing characteristic, give decision and purpose to no\r\none, and suffice only the lowest level of vacant minds.\r\n\r\nOf what is called the drama, or dramatic presentation in the United\r\nStates, as now put forth at the theatres, I should say it deserves to\r\nbe treated with the same gravity, and on a par with the questions\r\nof ornamental confectionery at public dinners, or the arrangement of\r\ncurtains and hangings in a ball-room--nor more, nor less. Of the other,\r\nI will not insult the reader's intelligence, (once really entering into\r\nthe atmosphere of these Vistas,) by supposing it necessary to show,\r\nin detail, why the copious dribble, either of our little or well-known\r\nrhymesters, does not fulfil, in any respect, the needs and august\r\noccasions of this land. America demands a poetry that is bold, modern,\r\nand all-surrounding and kosmical, as she is herself. It must in no\r\nrespect ignore science or the modern, but inspire itself with science\r\nand the modern. It must bend its vision toward the future, more than\r\nthe past. Like America, it must extricate itself from even the greatest\r\nmodels of the past, and, while courteous to them, must have entire faith\r\nin itself, and the products of its own democratic spirit only. Like her,\r\nit must place in the van, and hold up at all hazards, the banner of\r\nthe divine pride of man in himself, (the radical foundation of the new\r\nreligion.) Long enough have the People been listening to poems in which\r\ncommon humanity, deferential, bends low, humiliated, acknowledging\r\nsuperiors. But America listens to no such poems. Erect, inflated, and\r\nfully self-esteeming be the chant; and then America will listen with\r\npleased ears.\r\n\r\nNor may the genuine gold, the gems, when brought to light at last, be\r\nprobably usher'd forth from any of the quarters currently counted on.\r\nTo-day, doubtless, the infant genius of American poetic expression,\r\n(eluding those highly-refined imported and gilt-edged themes,\r\nand sentimental and butterfly flights, pleasant to orthodox\r\npublishers--causing tender spasms in the coteries, and warranted not to\r\nchafe the sensitive cuticle of the most exquisitely artificial gossamer\r\ndelicacy,) lies sleeping far away, happily unrecognized and uninjur'd by\r\nthe coteries, the art-writers, the talkers and critics of the saloons,\r\nor the lecturers in the colleges--lies sleeping, aside, unrecking\r\nitself, in some western idiom, or native Michigan or Tennessee repartee,\r\nor stumpspeech--or in Kentucky or Georgia, or the Carolinas--or in some\r\nslang or local song or allusion of the Manhattan, Boston, Philadelphia\r\nor Baltimore mechanic--or up in the Maine woods--or off in the hut of\r\nthe California miner, or crossing the Rocky mountains, or along\r\nthe Pacific railroad--or on the breasts of the young farmers of\r\nthe northwest, or Canada, or boatmen of the lakes. Rude and coarse\r\nnursing-beds, these; but only from such beginnings and stocks,\r\nindigenous here, may haply arrive, be grafted, and sprout, in time,\r\nflowers of genuine American aroma, and fruits truly and fully our own.\r\n\r\nI say it were a standing disgrace to these States--I say it were a\r\ndisgrace to any nation, distinguish'd above others by the variety and\r\nvastness of its territories, its materials, its inventive activity,\r\nand the splendid practicality of its people, not to rise and soar above\r\nothers also in its original styles in literature and art, and its\r\nown supply of intellectual and esthetic masterpieces, archetypal, and\r\nconsistent with itself. I know not a land except ours that has not, to\r\nsome extent, however small, made its title clear. The Scotch have their\r\nborn ballads, subtly expressing their past and present, and expressing\r\ncharacter. The Irish have theirs. England, Italy, France, Spain, theirs.\r\nWhat has America? With exhaustless mines of the richest ore of epic,\r\nlyric, tale, tune, picture, etc., in the Four Years' War; with, indeed,\r\nI sometimes think, the richest masses of material ever afforded a\r\nnation, more variegated, and on a larger scale--the first sign of\r\nproportionate, native, imaginative Soul, and first-class works to match,\r\nis, (I cannot too often repeat,) so far wanting.\r\n\r\nLong ere the second centennial arrives, there will be some forty to\r\nfifty great States, among them Canada and Cuba. When the present century\r\ncloses, our population will be sixty or seventy millions. The Pacific\r\nwill be ours, and the Atlantic mainly ours. There will be daily electric\r\ncommunication with every part of the globe. What an age! What a land!\r\nWhere, elsewhere, one so great? The individuality of one nation must\r\nthen, as always, lead the world. Can there be any doubt who the leader\r\nought to be? Bear in mind, though, that nothing less than the mightiest\r\noriginal non-subordinated SOUL has ever really, gloriously led, or ever\r\ncan lead. (This Soul--its other name, in these Vistas, is LITERATURE.)\r\n\r\nIn fond fancy leaping those hundred years ahead, let us survey America's\r\nworks, poems, philosophies, fulfilling prophecies, and giving form and\r\ndecision to best ideals. Much that is now undream'd of, we might then\r\nperhaps see establish'd, luxuriantly cropping forth, richness, vigor of\r\nletters and of artistic expression, in whose products character will be\r\na main requirement, and not merely erudition or elegance.\r\n\r\nIntense and loving comradeship, the personal and passionate attachment\r\nof man to man--which, hard to define, underlies the lessons and ideals\r\nof the profound saviours of every land and age, and which seems to\r\npromise, when thoroughly develop'd, cultivated and recognized in manners\r\nand literature, the most substantial hope and safety of the future of\r\nthese States, will then be fully express'd.[29]\r\n\r\nA strong fibred joyousness and faith, and the sense of health _al\r\nfresco_, may well enter into the preparation of future noble American\r\nauthorship. Part of the test of a great literatus shall be the absence\r\nin him of the idea of the covert, the lurid, the maleficent, the devil,\r\nthe grim estimates inherited from the Puritans, hell, natural depravity,\r\nand the like. The great literatus will be known, among the rest, by his\r\ncheerful simplicity, his adherence to natural standards, his limitless\r\nfaith in God, his reverence, and by the absence in him of doubt, ennui,\r\nburlesque, persiflage, or any strain'd and temporary fashion.\r\n\r\nNor must I fail, again and yet again, to clinch, reiterate more plainly\r\nstill, (O that indeed such survey as we fancy, may show in time this\r\npart completed also!) the lofty aim, surely the proudest and the purest,\r\nin whose service the future literatus, of whatever field, may gladly\r\nlabor. As we have intimated, offsetting the material civilization of our\r\nrace, our nationality, its wealth, territories, factories, population,\r\nproducts, trade, and military and naval strength, and breathing breath\r\nof life into all these, and more, must be its moral civilization--the\r\nformulation, expression, and aidancy whereof, is the very highest height\r\nof literature. The climax of this loftiest range of civilization, rising\r\nabove all the gorgeous shows and results of wealth, intellect, power,\r\nand art, as such--above even theology and religious fervor--is to be its\r\ndevelopment, from the eternal bases, and the fit expression, of absolute\r\nConscience, moral soundness, Justice. Even in religious fervor there\r\nis a touch of animal heat. But moral conscientiousness, crystalline,\r\nwithout flaw, not Godlike only, entirely human, awes and enchants\r\nforever. Great is emotional love, even in the order of the rational\r\nuniverse. But, if we must make gradations, I am clear there is something\r\ngreater. Power, love, veneration, products, genius, esthetics, tried by\r\nsubtlest comparisons, analyses, and in serenest moods, somewhere fail,\r\nsomehow become vain. Then noiseless, withflowing steps, the lord,\r\nthe sun, the last ideal comes. By the names right, justice, truth, we\r\nsuggest, but do not describe it. To the world of men it remains a\r\ndream, an idea as they call it. But no dream is it to the wise--but the\r\nproudest, almost only solid, lasting thing of all. Its analogy in the\r\nmaterial universe is what holds together this world, and every object\r\nupon it, and carries its dynamics on forever sure and safe. Its lack,\r\nand the persistent shirking of it, as in life, sociology, literature,\r\npolitics, business, and even sermonizing, these times, or any times,\r\nstill leaves the abysm, the mortal flaw and smutch, mocking civilization\r\nto-day, with all its unquestion'd triumphs, and all the civilization so\r\nfar known.[30]\r\n\r\nPresent literature, while magnificently fulfilling certain popular\r\ndemands, with plenteous knowledge and verbal smartness, is profoundly\r\nsophisticated, insane, and its very joy is morbid. It needs tally and\r\nexpress Nature, and the spirit of Nature, and to know and obey the\r\nstandards. I say the question of Nature, largely consider'd, involves\r\nthe questions of the esthetic, the emotional, and the religious--and\r\ninvolves happiness. A fitly born and bred race, growing up in right\r\nconditions of out-door as much as in-door harmony, activity and\r\ndevelopment, would probably, from and in those conditions, find it\r\nenough merely _to live_--and would, in their relations to the sky, air,\r\nwater, trees, &c., and to the countless common shows, and in the fact of\r\nlife itself, discover and achieve happiness--with Being suffused night\r\nand day by wholesome extasy, surpassing all the pleasures that wealth,\r\namusement, and even gratified intellect, erudition, or the sense of art,\r\ncan give.\r\n\r\nIn the prophetic literature of these States, (the reader of my\r\nspeculations will miss their principal stress unless he allows well for\r\nthe point that a new Literature, perhaps a new Metaphysics, certainly a\r\nnew Poetry, are to be, in my opinion, the only sure and worthy supports\r\nand expressions of the American Democracy,) Nature, true Nature, and\r\nthe true idea of Nature, long absent, must, above all, become fully\r\nrestored, enlarged, and must furnish the pervading atmosphere to poems,\r\nand the test of all high literary and esthetic compositions. I do not\r\nmean the smooth walks, trimm'd hedges, poseys and nightingales of the\r\nEnglish poets, but the whole orb, with its geologic history, the kosmos,\r\ncarrying fire and snow, that rolls through the illimitable areas, light\r\nas a feather, though weighing billions of tons. Furthermore, as by\r\nwhat we now partially call Nature is intended, at most, only what is\r\nentertainable by the physical conscience, the sense of matter, and\r\nof good animal health--on these it must be distinctly accumulated,\r\nincorporated, that man, comprehending these, has, in towering\r\nsuperaddition, the moral and spiritual consciences, indicating his\r\ndestination beyond the ostensible, the mortal.\r\n\r\nTo the heights of such estimate of Nature indeed ascending, we proceed\r\nto make observations for our Vistas, breathing rarest air. What is\r\nI believe called Idealism seems to me to suggest, (guarding against\r\nextravagance, and ever modified even by its opposite,) the course\r\nof inquiry and desert of favor for our New World metaphysics, their\r\nfoundation of and in literature, giving hue to all.[31]\r\n\r\nThe elevating and etherealizing ideas of the unknown and of unreality\r\nmust be brought forward with authority, as they are the legitimate heirs\r\nof the known, and of reality, and at least as great as their parents.\r\nFearless of scoffing, and of the ostent, let us take our stand,\r\nour ground, and never desert it, to confront the growing excess and\r\narrogance of realism. To the cry, now victorious--the cry of sense,\r\nscience, flesh, incomes, farms, merchandise, logic, intellect,\r\ndemonstrations, solid perpetuities, buildings of brick and iron, or\r\neven the facts of the shows of trees, earth, rocks, &c., fear not, my\r\nbrethren, my sisters, to sound out with equally determin'd voice,\r\nthat conviction brooding within the recesses of every envision'd\r\nsoul--illusions! apparitions! figments all! True, we must not condemn\r\nthe show, neither absolutely deny it, for the indispensability of its\r\nmeanings; but how clearly we see that, migrate in soul to what we can\r\nalready conceive of superior and spiritual points of view, and, palpable\r\nas it seems under present relations, it all and several might, nay\r\ncertainly would, fall apart and vanish.\r\n\r\nI hail with joy the oceanic, variegated, intense practical energy, the\r\ndemand for facts, even the business materialism of the current age,\r\nour States. But we to the age or land in which these things, movements,\r\nstopping at themselves, do not tend to ideas. As fuel to flame, and\r\nflame to the heavens, so must wealth, science, materialism--even this\r\ndemocracy of which we make so much--unerringly feed the highest mind,\r\nthe soul. Infinitude the flight: fathomless the mystery. Man, so\r\ndiminutive, dilates beyond the sensible universe, competes with,\r\noutcopes space and time, meditating even one great idea. Thus, and\r\nthus only, does a human being, his spirit, ascend above, and justify,\r\nobjective Nature, which, probably nothing in itself, is incredibly and\r\ndivinely serviceable, indispensable, real, here. And as the purport\r\nof objective Nature is doubtless folded, hidden, somewhere here--as\r\nsomewhere here is what this globe and its manifold forms, and the light\r\nof day, and night's darkness, and life itself, with all its experiences,\r\nare for--it is here the great literature, especially verse, must get its\r\ninspiration and throbbing blood. Then may we attain to a poetry worthy\r\nthe immortal soul of man, and widen, while absorbing materials, and,\r\nin their own sense, the shows of Nature, will, above all, have, both\r\ndirectly and indirectly, a freeing, fluidizing, expanding, religious\r\ncharacter, exulting with science, fructifying the moral elements, and\r\nstimulating aspirations, and meditations on the unknown.\r\n\r\nThe process, so far, is indirect and peculiar, and though it may be\r\nsuggested, cannot be defined. Observing, rapport, and with intuition,\r\nthe shows and forms presented by Nature, the sensuous luxuriance, the\r\nbeautiful in living men and women, the actual play of passions, in\r\nhistory and life--and, above all, from those developments either in\r\nNature or human personality in which power, (dearest of all to the sense\r\nof the artist,) transacts itself-out of these, and seizing what is in\r\nthem, the poet, the esthetic worker in any field, by the divine magic\r\nof his genius, projects them, their analogies, by curious removes,\r\nindirections, in literature and art. (No useless attempt to repeat\r\nthe material creation, by daguerreotyping the exact likeness by mortal\r\nmental means.) This is the image-making faculty, coping with material\r\ncreation, and rivaling, almost triumphing over it. This alone, when\r\nall the other parts of a specimen of literature or art are ready and\r\nwaiting, can breathe into it the breath of life, and endow it with\r\nidentity.\r\n\r\n\"The true question to ask,\" says the librarian of Congress in a paper\r\nread before the Social Science Convention at New York, October, 1869,\r\n\"The true question to ask respecting a book, is, _has it help'd any\r\nhuman soul?_\" This is the hint, statement, not only of the great\r\nliteratus, his book, but of every great artist. It may be that all works\r\nof art are to be first tried by their art qualities, their image-forming\r\ntalent, and their dramatic, pictorial, plot-constructing, euphonious and\r\nother talents. Then, whenever claiming to be first-class works, they are\r\nto be strictly and sternly tried by their foundation in, and radiation,\r\nin the highest sense, and always indirectly, of the ethic principles,\r\nand eligibility to free, arouse, dilate.\r\n\r\nAs, within the purposes of the Kosmos, and vivifying all meteorology,\r\nand all the congeries of the mineral, vegetable and animal worlds--all\r\nthe physical growth and development of man, and all the history of the\r\nrace in politics, religions, wars, &c., there is a moral purpose, a\r\nvisible or invisible intention, certainly underlying all--its results\r\nand proof needing to be patiently waited for--needing intuition,\r\nfaith, idiosyncrasy, to its realization, which many, and especially\r\nthe intellectual, do not have--so in the product, or congeries of\r\nthe product, of the greatest literatus. This is the last, profoundest\r\nmeasure and test of a first-class literary or esthetic achievement, and\r\nwhen understood and put in force must fain, I say, lead to works, books,\r\nnobler than any hitherto known. Lo! Nature, (the only complete, actual\r\npoem,) existing calmly in the divine scheme, containing all, content,\r\ncareless of the criticisms of a day, or these endless and wordy\r\nchatterers. And lo! to the consciousness of the soul, the permanent\r\nidentity, the thought, the something, before which the magnitude even\r\nof democracy, art, literature, &c., dwindles, becomes partial,\r\nmeasurable--something that fully satisfies, (which those do not.) That\r\nsomething is the All, and the idea of All, with the accompanying idea\r\nof eternity, and of itself, the soul, buoyant, indestructible, sailing\r\nspace forever, visiting every region, as a ship the sea. And again lo!\r\nthe pulsations in all matter, all spirit, throbbing forever--the eternal\r\nbeats, eternal systole and diastole of life in things--wherefrom I feel\r\nand know that death is not the ending, as was thought, but rather the\r\nreal beginning--and that nothing ever is or can be lost, nor ever die,\r\nnor soul, nor matter.\r\n\r\nIn the future of these States must arise poets immenser far, and make\r\ngreat poems of death. The poems of life are great, but there must be the\r\npoems of the purports of life, not only in itself, but beyond itself.\r\nI have eulogized Homer, the sacred bards of Jewry, Eschylus, Juvenal,\r\nShakspere, &c., and acknowledged their inestimable value. But,\r\n(with perhaps the exception, in some, not all respects, of the\r\nsecond-mention'd,) I say there must, for future and democratic purposes,\r\nappear poets, (dare I to say so?) of higher class even than any of\r\nthose--poets not only possess'd of the religious fire and abandon of\r\nIsaiah, luxuriant in the epic talent of Homer, or for proud characters\r\nas in Shakspere, but consistent with the Hegelian formulas, and\r\nconsistent with modern science. America needs, and the world needs, a\r\nclass of bards who will, now and ever, so link and tally the rational\r\nphysical being of man, with the ensembles of time and space, and with\r\nthis vast and multiform show, Nature, surrounding him, ever tantalizing\r\nhim, equally a part, and yet not a part of him, as to essentially\r\nharmonize, satisfy, and put at rest. Faith, very old, now scared away\r\nby science, must be restored, brought back by the same power that caused\r\nher departure--restored with new sway, deeper, wider, higher than ever.\r\nSurely, this universal ennui, this coward fear, this shuddering at\r\ndeath, these low, degrading views, are not always to rule the spirit\r\npervading future society, as it has the past, and does the present. What\r\nthe Roman Lucretius sought most nobly, yet all too blindly, negatively\r\nto do for his age and its successors, must be done positively by some\r\ngreat coming literatus, especially poet, who, while remaining fully\r\npoet, will absorb whatever science indicates, with spiritualism, and\r\nout of them, and out of his own genius, will compose the great poem\r\nof death. Then will man indeed confront Nature, and confront time and\r\nspace, both with science, and _con amore_, and take his right place,\r\nprepared for life, master of fortune and misfortune. And then that which\r\nwas long wanted will be supplied, and the ship that had it not before in\r\nall her voyages, will have an anchor.\r\n\r\nThere are still other standards, suggestions, for products of high\r\nliteratuses. That which really balances and conserves the social and\r\npolitical world is not so much legislation, police, treaties, and dread\r\nof punishment, as the latent eternal intuitional sense, in humanity,\r\nof fairness, manliness, decorum, &c. Indeed, this perennial regulation,\r\ncontrol, and oversight, by self-suppliance, is _sine qua non_ to\r\ndemocracy; and a highest widest aim of democratic literature may well\r\nbe to bring forth, cultivate, brace, and strengthen this sense, in\r\nindividuals and society. A strong mastership of the general inferior\r\nself by the superior self, is to be aided, secured, indirectly, but\r\nsurely, by the literatus, in his works, shaping, for individual or\r\naggregate democracy, a great passionate body, in and along with which\r\ngoes a great masterful spirit.\r\n\r\nAnd still, providing for contingencies, I fain confront the fact, the\r\nneed of powerful native philosophs and orators and bards, these States,\r\nas rallying points to come, in times of danger, and to fend off ruin\r\nand defection. For history is long, long, long. Shift and turn the\r\ncombinations of the statement as we may, the problem of the future\r\nof America is in certain respects as dark as it is vast. Pride,\r\ncompetition, segregation, vicious wilfulness, and license beyond\r\nexample, brood already upon us. Unwieldy and immense, who shall hold in\r\nbehemoth? who bridle leviathan? Flaunt it as we choose, athwart and\r\nover the roads of our progress loom huge uncertainty, and dreadful,\r\nthreatening gloom. It is useless to deny it: Democracy grows rankly up\r\nthe thickest, noxious, deadliest plants and fruits of all--brings worse\r\nand worse invaders--needs newer, larger, stronger, keener compensations\r\nand compellers.\r\n\r\nOur lands, embracing so much, (embracing indeed the whole, rejecting\r\nnone,) hold in their breast that flame also, capable of consuming\r\nthemselves, consuming us all. Short as the span of our national life has\r\nbeen, already have death and downfall crowded close upon us--and will\r\nagain crowd close, no doubt, even if warded off. Ages to come may never\r\nknow, but I know, how narrowly during the late secession war--and more\r\nthan once, and more than twice or thrice--our Nationality, (wherein\r\nbound up, as in a ship in a storm, depended, and yet depend, all our\r\nbest life, all hope, all value,) just grazed, just by a hair escaped\r\ndestruction. Alas! to think of them! the agony and bloody sweat of\r\ncertain of those hours! those cruel, sharp, suspended crises!\r\n\r\nEven to-day, amid these whirls, incredible flippancy, and blind fury of\r\nparties, infidelity, entire lack of first-class captains and leaders,\r\nadded to the plentiful meanness and vulgarity of the ostensible\r\nmasses--that problem, the labor question, beginning to open like a\r\nyawning gulf, rapidly widening every year--what prospect have we? We\r\nsail a dangerous sea of seething currents, cross and under-currents,\r\nvortices--all so dark, untried--and whither shall we turn? It seems\r\nas if the Almighty had spread before this nation charts of imperial\r\ndestinies, dazzling as the sun, yet with many a deep intestine\r\ndifficulty, and human aggregate of cankerous imperfection-saying, lo!\r\nthe roads, the only plans of development, long and varied with all\r\nterrible balks and ebullitions. You said in your soul, I will be empire\r\nof empires, overshadowing all else, past and present, putting\r\nthe history of Old-World dynasties, conquests behind me, as of no\r\naccount--making a new history, a history of democracy, making old\r\nhistory a dwarf--I alone inaugurating largeness, culminating time. If\r\nthese, O lands of America, are indeed the prizes, the determinations of\r\nyour soul, be it so. But behold the cost, and already specimens of the\r\ncost. Thought you greatness was to ripen for you like a pear? If you\r\nwould have greatness, know that you must conquer it through ages,\r\ncenturies--must pay for it with a proportionate price. For you too, as\r\nfor all lands, the struggle, the traitor, the wily person in office,\r\nscrofulous wealth, the surfeit of prosperity, the demonism of greed,\r\nthe hell of passion, the decay of faith, the long postponement, the\r\nfossil-like lethargy, the ceaseless need of revolutions, prophets,\r\nthunder-storms, deaths, births, new projections and invigorations of\r\nideas and men.\r\n\r\nYet I have dream'd, merged in that hidden-tangled problem of our fate,\r\nwhose long unraveling stretches mysteriously through time--dream'd out,\r\nportray'd, hinted already--a little or a larger band--a band of brave\r\nand true, unprecedented yet--arm'd and equipt at every point--the\r\nmembers separated, it may be, by different dates and States, or south,\r\nor north, or east, or west--Pacific, Atlantic, Southern, Canadian--a\r\nyear, a century here, and other centuries there--but always one, compact\r\nin soul, conscience-conserving, God-inculcating, inspirid achievers, not\r\nonly in literature, the greatest art, but achievers in all art--a new,\r\nundying order, dynasty, from age to age transmitted--a band, a class,\r\nat least as fit to cope with current years, our dangers, needs, as those\r\nwho, for their times, so long, so well, in armor or in cowl, upheld\r\nand made illustrious, that far-back feudal, priestly world. To offset\r\nchivalry, indeed, those vanish'd countless knights, old altars, abbeys,\r\npriests, ages and strings of ages, a knightlier and more sacred cause\r\nto-day demands, and shall supply, in a New World, to larger, grander\r\nwork, more than the counterpart and tally of them.\r\n\r\nArrived now, definitely, at an apex for these Vistas, I confess that\r\nthe promulgation and belief in such a class or institution--a new and\r\ngreater literatus order--its possibility, (nay certainty,) underlies\r\nthese entire speculations--and that the rest, the other parts, as\r\nsuperstructures, are all founded upon it. It really seems to me the\r\ncondition, not only of our future national and democratic development,\r\nbut of our perpetuation. In the highly artificial and materialistic\r\nbases of modern civilization, with the corresponding arrangements and\r\nmethods of living, the force-infusion of intellect alone, the depraving\r\ninfluences of riches just as much as poverty, the absence of all high\r\nideals in character--with the long series of tendencies, shapings, which\r\nfew are strong enough to resist, and which now seem, with steam-engine\r\nspeed, to be everywhere turning out the generations of humanity like\r\nuniform iron castings--all of which, as compared with the feudal ages,\r\nwe can yet do nothing better than accept, make the best of, and even\r\nwelcome, upon the whole, for their oceanic practical grandeur, and their\r\nrestless wholesale kneading of the masses--I say of all this tremendous\r\nand dominant play of solely materialistic bearings upon current life in\r\nthe United States, with the results as already seen, accumulating, and\r\nreaching far into the future, that they must either be confronted and\r\nmet by at least an equally subtle and tremendous force-infusion for\r\npurposes of spiritualization, for the pure conscience, for genuine\r\nesthetics, and for absolute and primal manliness and womanliness--or\r\nelse our modern civilization, with all its improvements, is in vain,\r\nand we are on the road to a destiny, a status, equivalent, in its real\r\nworld, to that of the fabled damned.\r\n\r\nProspecting thus the coming unsped days, and that new order in\r\nthem--marking the endless train of exercise, development, unwind, in\r\nnation as in man, which life is for--we see, fore-indicated, amid these\r\nprospects and hopes, new law-forces of spoken and written language--not\r\nmerely the pedagogue-forms, correct, regular, familiar with precedents,\r\nmade for matters of outside propriety, fine words, thoughts definitely\r\ntold out--but a language fann'd by the breath of Nature, which leaps\r\noverhead, cares mostly for impetus and effects, and for what it plants\r\nand invigorates to grow--tallies life and character, and seldomer tells\r\na thing than suggests or necessitates it. In fact, a new theory of\r\nliterary composition for imaginative works of the very first class, and\r\nespecially for highest poems, is the sole course open to these States.\r\nBooks are to be call'd for, and supplied, on the assumption that the\r\nprocess of reading is not a half-sleep, but, in highest sense, an\r\nexercise, a gymnast's struggle; that the reader is to do something for\r\nhimself, must be on the alert, must himself or herself construct indeed\r\nthe poem, argument, history, metaphysical essay--the text furnishing the\r\nhints, the clue, the start or frame-work. Not the book needs so much\r\nto be the complete thing, but the reader of the book does. That were\r\nto make a nation of supple and athletic minds, well-train'd, intuitive,\r\nused to depend on themselves, and not on a few coteries of writers.\r\n\r\nInvestigating here, we see, not that it is a little thing we have, in\r\nhaving the bequeath'd libraries, countless shelves of volumes, records,\r\netc.; yet how serious the danger, depending entirely on them, of the\r\nbloodless vein, the nerveless arm, the false application, at second or\r\nthird hand. We see that the real interest of this people of ours in the\r\ntheology, history, poetry, politics, and personal models of the past,\r\n(the British islands, for instance, and indeed all the past,) is not\r\nnecessarily to mould ourselves or our literature upon them, but to\r\nattain fuller, more definite comparisons, warnings, and the insight to\r\nourselves, our own present, and our own far grander, different, future\r\nhistory, religion, social customs, &c. We see that almost everything\r\nthat has been written, sung, or stated, of old, with reference to\r\nhumanity under the feudal and oriental institutes, religions, and\r\nfor other lands, needs to be re-written, re-sung, re-stated, in terms\r\nconsistent with the institution of these States, and to come in range\r\nand obedient uniformity with them.\r\n\r\nWe see, as in the universes of the material kosmos, after\r\nmeteorological, vegetable, and animal cycles, man at last arises, born\r\nthrough them, to prove them, concentrate them, to turn upon them with\r\nwonder and love--to command them, adorn them, and carry them upward\r\ninto superior realms--so, out of the series of the preceding social and\r\npolitical universes, now arise these States. We see that while many were\r\nsupposing things establish'd and completed, really the grandest things\r\nalways remain; and discover that the work of the New World is not ended,\r\nbut only fairly begun.\r\n\r\nWe see our land, America, her literature, esthetics, &c., as,\r\nsubstantially, the getting in form, or effusement and statement, of\r\ndeepest basic elements and loftiest final meanings, of history and\r\nman--and the portrayal, (under the eternal laws and conditions of\r\nbeauty,) of our own physiognomy, the subjective tie and expression of\r\nthe objective, as from our own combination, continuation, and points of\r\nview--and the deposit and record of the national mentality, character,\r\nappeals, heroism, wars, and even liberties--where these, and\r\nall, culminate in native literary and artistic formulation, to be\r\nperpetuated; and not having which native, first-class formulation, she\r\nwill flounder about, and her other, however imposing, eminent greatness,\r\nprove merely a passing gleam; but truly having which, she will\r\nunderstand herself, live nobly, nobly contribute, emanate, and,\r\nswinging, poised safely on herself, illumin'd and illuming, become a\r\nfull-form'd world, and divine Mother not only of material but spiritual\r\nworlds, in ceaseless succession through time--the main thing being the\r\naverage, the bodily, the concrete, the democratic, the popular, on which\r\nall the superstructures of the future are to permanently rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n[20] \"From a territorial area of less than nine hundred thousand\r\nsquare miles, the Union has expanded into over four millions and\r\na half--fifteen times larger than that of Great Britain and France\r\ncombined--with a shore-line, including Alaska, equal to the entire\r\ncircumference of the earth, and with a domain within these lines far\r\nwider than that of the Romans in their proudest days of conquest and\r\nrenown. With a river, lake, and coastwise commerce estimated at over two\r\nthousand millions of dollars per year; with a railway traffic of four to\r\nsix thousand millions per year, and the annual domestic exchanges of the\r\ncountry running up to nearly ten thousand millions per year; with over\r\ntwo thousand millions of dollars invested in manufacturing, mechanical,\r\nand mining industry; with over five hundred millions of acres of land\r\nin actual occupancy, valued, with their appurtenances, at over seven\r\nthousand millions of dollars, and producing annually crops valued at\r\nover three thousand millions of dollars; with a realm which, if the\r\ndensity of Belgium's population were possible, would be vast enough to\r\ninclude all the present inhabitants of the world; and with equal rights\r\nguaranteed to even the poorest and humblest of our forty millions of\r\npeople--we can, with a manly pride akin to that which distinguish'd the\r\npalmiest days of Rome, claim,\" &c., &c., &c.--_Vice-President Colfax's\r\nSpeech, July 4, 1870_.\r\n\r\nLATER--_London \"Times,\" (Weekly,) June 23, '82_.\r\n\r\n\"The wonderful wealth-producing power of the United States defies and\r\nsets at naught the grave drawbacks of a mischievous protective tariff,\r\nand has already obliterated, almost wholly, the traces of the greatest\r\nof modern civil wars. What is especially remarkable in the present\r\ndevelopment of American energy and success is its wide and equable\r\ndistribution. North and south, east and west, on the shores of the\r\nAtlantic and the Pacific, along the chain of the great lakes, in the\r\nvalley of the Mississippi, and on the coasts of the gulf of Mexico,\r\nthe creation of wealth and the increase of population are signally\r\nexhibited. It is quite true, as has been shown by the recent\r\napportionment of population in the House of Representatives, that some\r\nsections of the Union have advanced, relatively to the rest, in an\r\nextraordinary and unexpected degree. But this does not imply that the\r\nStates which have gain'd no additional representatives or have actually\r\nlost some have been stationary or have receded. The fact is that the\r\npresent tide of prosperity has risen so high that it has overflow' d all\r\nbarriers, and has fill'd up the back-waters, and establish'd something\r\nlike an approach to uniform success.\"\r\n\r\n[21] See, for hereditaments, specimens, Walter Scott's Border\r\nMinstrelsy, Percy's collection, Ellis's early English Metrical\r\nRomances, the European continental poems of Walter of Aquitania, and the\r\nNibelungen, of pagan stock, but monkish-feudal redaction; the history of\r\nthe Troubadours, by Fauriel; even the far-back cumbrous old Hindu epics,\r\nas indicating the Asian eggs out of which European chivalry was hatch'd;\r\nTicknor's chapters on the Cid, and on the Spanish poems and poets of\r\nCalderon's time. Then always, and, of course, as the superbest poetic\r\nculmination-expression of feudalism, the Shaksperean dramas, in\r\nthe attitudes, dialogue, characters, &c., of the princes, lords and\r\ngentlemen, the pervading atmosphere, the implied and express'd standard\r\nof manners, the high port and proud stomach, the regal embroidery of\r\nstyle, &c.\r\n\r\n[22] Of these rapidly-sketch'd hiatuses, the two which seem to me most\r\nserious are, for one, the condition, absence, or perhaps the singular\r\nabeyance, of moral conscientious fibre all through American society;\r\nand, for another, the appaling depletion of women in their powers of\r\nsane athletic maternity, their crowning attribute, and ever making the\r\nwoman, in loftiest spheres, superior to the man.\r\n\r\nI have sometimes thought, indeed, that the sole avenue and means of a\r\nreconstructed sociology depended, primarily, on a new birth, elevation,\r\nexpansion, invigoration of woman, affording, for races to come, (as the\r\nconditions that antedate birth are indispensable,) a perfect motherhood.\r\nGreat, great, indeed, far greater than they know, is the sphere of\r\nwomen. But doubtless the question of such new sociology all goes\r\ntogether, includes many varied and complex influences and premises, and\r\nthe man as well as the woman, and the woman as well as the man.\r\n\r\n[23] The question hinted here is one which time only can answer. Must\r\nnot the virtue of modern Individualism, continually enlarging, usurping\r\nall, seriously affect, perhaps keep down entirely, in America, the like\r\nof the ancient virtue of Patriotism, the fervid and absorbing love of\r\ngeneral country? I have no doubt myself that the two will merge, and\r\nwill mutually profit and brace each other, and that from them a greater\r\nproduct, a third, will arise. But I feel that at present they and their\r\noppositions form a serious problem and paradox in the United States.\r\n\r\n[24] \"SHOOTING NIAGARA.\"--I was at first roused to much anger and\r\nabuse by this essay from Mr. Carlyle, so insulting to the theory of\r\nAmerica--but happening to think afterwards how I had more than once been\r\nin the like mood, during which his essay was evidently cast, and seen\r\npersons and things in the same light, (indeed some might say there are\r\nsigns of the same feeling in these Vistas)--I have since read it again,\r\nnot only as a study, expressing as it does certain judgments from the\r\nhighest feudal point of view, but have read it with respect as coming\r\nfrom an earnest soul, and as contributing certain sharp-cutting metallic\r\ngrains, which, if not gold or silver, may be good, hard, honest iron.\r\n\r\n[25] For fear of mistake, I may as well distinctly specify, as\r\ncheerfully included in the model and standard of these Vistas,\r\na practical, stirring, worldly, money-making, even materialistic\r\ncharacter. It is undeniable that our farms, stores, offices, dry-goods,\r\ncoal and groceries, enginery, cash-accounts, trades, earnings, markets,\r\n&c., should be attended to in earnest, and actively pursued, just as\r\nif they had a real and permanent existence. I perceive clearly that the\r\nextreme business energy, and this almost maniacal appetite for wealth\r\nprevalent in the United States, are parts of amelioration and progress,\r\nindispensably needed to prepare the very results I demand. My theory\r\nincludes riches, and the getting of riches, and the amplest products,\r\npower, activity, inventions, movements, &c. Upon them, as upon\r\nsubstrata, I raise the edifice design'd in these Vistas.\r\n\r\n[26] The whole present system of the officering and personnel of the\r\narmy and navy of these States, and the spirit and letter of their\r\ntrebly-aristocratic rules and regulations, is a monstrous exotic, a\r\nnuisance and revolt, and belong here just as much as orders of nobility,\r\nor the Pope's council of cardinals. I say if the present theory of\r\nour army and navy is sensible and true, then the rest of America is an\r\nunmitigated fraud.\r\n\r\n[27] A: After the rest is satiated, all interest culminates in the field\r\nof persons, and never flags there. Accordingly in this field have the\r\ngreat poets and literatuses signally toil'd. They too, in all ages, all\r\nlands, have been creators, fashioning, making types of men and women,\r\nas Adam and Eve are made in the divine fable. Behold, shaped, bred by\r\norientalism, feudalism, through their long growth and culmination, and\r\nbreeding back in return--(when shall we have an equal series, typical of\r\ndemocracy?)--behold, commencing in primal Asia, (apparently formulated,\r\nin what beginning we know, in the gods of the mythologies, and coming\r\ndown thence,) a few samples out of the countless product, bequeath'd to\r\nthe moderns, bequeath'd to America as studies. For the men, Yudishtura,\r\nRama, Arjuna, Solomon, most of the Old and New Testament characters;\r\nAchilles, Ulysses, Theseus, Prometheus, Hercules, Aeneas, Plutarch's\r\nheroes; the Merlin of Celtic bards; the Cid, Arthur and his knights,\r\nSiegfried and Hagen in the Nibelungen; Roland and Oliver; Roustam in\r\nthe Shah-Nemah; and so on to Milton's Satan, Cervantes' Don Quixote,\r\nShakspere's Hamlet, Richard II., Lear, Marc Antony, &c., and the modern\r\nFaust. These, I say, are models, combined, adjusted to other standards\r\nthan America's, but of priceless value to her and hers.\r\n\r\nAmong women, the goddesses of the Egyptian, Indian and Greek\r\nmythologies, certain Bible characters, especially the Holy Mother;\r\nCleopatra, Penelope; the portraits of Brunhelde and Chriemhilde in the\r\nNibelungen; Oriana, Una, &c.; the modern Consuelo, Walter Scott's Jeanie\r\nand Effie Deans, &c., &c. (Yet woman portray'd or outlin'd at her best,\r\nor as perfect human mother, does not hitherto, it seems to me, fully\r\nappear in literature.)\r\n\r\n[28] Note, to-day, an instructive, curious spectacle and conflict.\r\nScience, (twin in its fields, of Democracy in its)--Science, testing\r\nabsolutely all thoughts, all works, has already burst well upon the\r\nworld--a sun, mounting, most illuminating, most glorious--surely never\r\nagain to set. But against it, deeply entrench'd, holding possession, yet\r\nremains, (not only through the churches and schools, but by imaginative\r\nliterature, and unregenerate poetry,) the fossil theology of\r\nthe mythic-materialistic, superstitious, untaught and credulous,\r\nfable-loving, primitive ages of humanity.\r\n\r\n[29] It is to the development, identification, and general prevalence\r\nof that fervid comradeship, (the adhesive love, at least rivaling the\r\namative love hitherto possessing imaginative literature, if not going\r\nbeyond it,) that I look for the counterbalance and offset of\r\nour materialistic and vulgar American democracy, and for the\r\nspiritualization thereof. Many will say it is a dream, and will not\r\nfollow my inferences: but I confidently expect a time when there will\r\nbe seen, running like a half-hid warp through all the myriad audible and\r\nvisible worldly interests of America, threads of manly friendship, fond\r\nand loving, pure and sweet, strong and life-long, carried to degrees\r\nhitherto unknown--not only giving tone to individual character, and\r\nmaking it unprecedently emotional, muscular, heroic, and refined, but\r\nhaving the deepest relations to general politics. I say democracy infers\r\nsuch loving comradeship, as its most inevitable twin or counterpart,\r\nwithout which it will be incomplete, in vain, and incapable of\r\nperpetuating itself.\r\n\r\n[30] I am reminded as I write that out of this very conscience, or idea\r\nof conscience, of intense moral right, and in its name and strain'd\r\nconstruction, the worst fanaticisms, wars, persecutions, murders, &c.,\r\nhave yet, in all lands, in the past, been broach'd, and have come to\r\ntheir devilish fruition. Much is to be said--but I may say here, and\r\nin response, that side by side with the unflagging stimulation of the\r\nelements of religion and conscience must henceforth move with\r\nequal sway, science, absolute reason, and the general proportionate\r\ndevelopment of the whole man. These scientific facts, deductions, are\r\ndivine too--precious counted parts of moral civilization, and, with\r\nphysical health, indispensable to it, to prevent fanaticism. For\r\nabstract religion, I perceive, is easily led astray, ever credulous, and\r\nis capable of devouring, remorseless, like fire and flame. Conscience,\r\ntoo, isolated from all else, and from the emotional nature, may but\r\nattain the beauty and purity of glacial, snowy ice. We want, for these\r\nStates, for the general character, a cheerful, religious fervor, endued\r\nwith the ever-present modifications of the human emotions, friendship,\r\nbenevolence, with a fair field for scientific inquiry, the right of\r\nindividual judgment, and always the cooling influences of material\r\nNature.\r\n\r\n[31] The culmination and fruit of literary artistic expression, and\r\nits final fields of pleasure for the human soul, are in metaphysics,\r\nincluding the mysteries of the spiritual world, the soul itself, and the\r\nquestion of the immortal continuation of our identity. In all ages, the\r\nmind of man has brought up here--and always will. Here, at least, of\r\nwhatever race or era, we stand on common ground. Applause, too, is\r\nunanimous, antique or modern. Those authors who work well in this\r\nfield--though their reward, instead of a handsome percentage, or\r\nroyalty, may be but simply the laurel-crown of the victors in the great\r\nOlympic games--will be dearest to humanity, and their works, however\r\nesthetically defective, will be treasur'd forever. The altitude of\r\nliterature and poetry has always been religion--and always will be. The\r\nIndian Vedas, the Naçkas of Zoroaster, the Tal mud of the Jews, the Old\r\nTestament, the Gospel of Christ and his disciples, Plato's works, the\r\nKoran of Mohammed, the Edda of Snorro, and so on toward our own day, to\r\nSwedenborg, and to the invaluable contributions of Leibnitz, Kant and\r\nHegel--these, with such poems only in which, (while singing well\r\nof persons and events, of the passions of man, and the shows of the\r\nmaterial universe,) the religious tone, the consciousness of mystery,\r\nthe recognition of the future, of the unknown, of Deity over and under\r\nall, and of the divine purpose, are never absent, but indirectly give\r\ntone to all--exhibit literature's real heights and elevations, towering\r\nup like the great mountains of the earth.\r\n\r\nStanding on this ground--the last, the highest, only permanent\r\nground--and sternly criticising, from it, all works, either of the\r\nliterary, or any art, we have peremptorily to dismiss every pretensive\r\nproduction, however fine its esthetic or intellectual points, which\r\nviolates or ignores, or even does not celebrate, the central divine\r\nidea of All, suffusing universe, of eternal trains of purpose, in\r\nthe development, by however slow degrees, of the physical, moral, and\r\nspiritual kosmos. I say he has studied, meditated to no profit,\r\nwhatever may be his mere erudition, who has not absorbed this simple\r\nconsciousness and faith. It is not entirely new--but it is for Democracy\r\nto elaborate it, and look to build upon and expand from it, with\r\nuncompromising reliance. Above the doors of teaching the inscription is\r\nto appear, Though little or nothing can be absolutely known, perceiv'd,\r\nexcept from a point of view which is evanescent, yet we know at least\r\none permanency, that Time and Space, in the will of God, furnish\r\nsuccessive chains, completions of material births and beginnings,\r\nsolve all discrepancies, fears and doubts, and eventually fulfil\r\nhappiness--and that the prophecy of those births, namely spiritual\r\nresults, throws the true arch over all teaching, all science. The local\r\nconsiderations of sin, disease, deformity, ignorance, death, &c., and\r\ntheir measurement by the superficial mind, and ordinary legislation and\r\ntheology, are to be met by science, boldly accepting, promulging this\r\nfaith, and planting the seeds of superber laws--of the explication of\r\nthe physical universe through the spiritual--and clearing the way for a\r\nreligion, sweet and unimpugnable alike to little child or great savan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGINS OF ATTEMPTED SECESSION\r\n\r\n_Not the whole matter, but some side facts worth conning to-day and any\r\nday_.\r\n\r\nI consider the war of attempted secession, 1860-'65, not as a struggle\r\nof two distinct and separate peoples, but a conflict (often happening,\r\nand very fierce) between the passions and paradoxes of one and the same\r\nidentity--perhaps the only terms on which that identity could really\r\nbecome fused, homogeneous and lasting. The origin and conditions out\r\nof which it arose, are full of lessons, full of warnings yet to the\r\nRepublic--and always will be. The underlying and principal of those\r\norigins are yet singularly ignored. The Northern States were really\r\njust as responsible for that war, (in its precedents, foundations,\r\ninstigations,) as the South. Let me try to give my view. From the age of\r\n21 to 40, (1840-'60,) I was interested in the political movements of the\r\nland, not so much as a participant, but as an observer, and a regular\r\nvoter at the elections. I think I was conversant with the springs of\r\naction, and their workings, not only in New York city and Brooklyn,\r\nbut understood them in the whole country, as I had made leisurely tours\r\nthrough all the middle States, and partially through the western and\r\nsouthern, and down to New Orleans, in which city I resided for some\r\ntime. (I was there at the close of the Mexican war--saw and talk'd with\r\nGeneral Taylor, and the other generals and officers, who were feted and\r\ndetain'd several days on their return victorious from that expedition.)\r\n\r\nOf course many and very contradictory things, specialties, developments,\r\nconstitutional views, &c., went to make up the origin of the war--but\r\nthe most significant general fact can be best indicated and stated as\r\nfollows: For twenty-five years previous to the outbreak, the controling\r\n\"Democratic\" nominating conventions of our Republic--starting from their\r\nprimaries in wards or districts, and so expanding to counties,\r\npowerful cities, States, and to the great Presidential nominating\r\nconventions--were getting to represent and be composed of more and more\r\nputrid and dangerous materials. Let me give a schedule, or list, of\r\none of these representative conventions for a long time before, and\r\ninclusive of, that which nominated Buchanan. (Remember they had come to\r\nbe the fountains and tissues of the American body politic, forming, as\r\nit were, the whole blood, legislation, office-holding, &c.) One of these\r\nconventions, from 1840 to '60, exhibited a spectacle such as could\r\nnever be seen except in our own age and in these States. The members who\r\ncomposed it were, seven-eighths of them, the meanest kind of bawling and\r\nblowing office-holders, office-seekers, pimps, malignants, conspirators,\r\nmurderers, fancy-men, custom-house clerks, contractors, kept-editors,\r\nspaniels well-train'd to carry and fetch, jobbers, infidels,\r\ndisunionists, terrorists, mail-riflers, slave-catchers, pushers of\r\nslavery, creatures of the President, creatures of would-be Presidents,\r\nspies, bribers, compromisers, lobbyers, sponges, ruin'd sports,\r\nexpell'd gamblers, policy-backers, monte-dealers, duellists, carriers\r\nof conceal'd weapons, deaf men, pimpled men, scarr'd inside with vile\r\ndisease, gaudy outside with gold chains made from the people's money\r\nand harlots' money twisted together; crawling, serpentine men, the lousy\r\ncombings and born freedom-sellers of the earth. And whence came they?\r\nFrom back-yards and bar-rooms; from out of the custom-houses, marshals'\r\noffices, post-offices, and gambling-hells; from the President's house,\r\nthe jail, the station-house; from unnamed by-places, where devilish\r\ndisunion was hatch'd at midnight; from political hearses, and from the\r\ncoffins inside, and from the shrouds inside of the coffins; from the\r\ntumors and abscesses of the land; from the skeletons and skulls in the\r\nvaults of the federal almshouses; and from the running sores of the\r\ngreat cities. Such, I say, form'd, or absolutely controll'd the forming\r\nof, the entire personnel, the atmosphere, nutriment and chyle, of our\r\nmunicipal, State, and National politics--substantially permeating,\r\nhandling, deciding, and wielding everything--legislation, nominations,\r\nelections, \"public sentiment,\" &c.--while the great masses of the\r\npeople, farmers, mechanics, and traders, were helpless in their gripe.\r\nThese conditions were mostly prevalent in the north and west, and\r\nespecially in New York and Philadelphia cities; and the southern\r\nleaders, (bad enough, but of a far higher order,) struck hands and\r\naffiliated with, and used them. Is it strange that a thunder-storm\r\nfollow'd such morbid and stifling cloud-strata?\r\n\r\nI say then, that what, as just outlined, heralded, and made the ground\r\nready for secession revolt, ought to be held up, through all the future,\r\nas the most instructive lesson in American political history--the most\r\nsignificant warning and beacon-light to coming generations. I say\r\nthat the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth terms of the American\r\nPresidency have shown that the villainy and shallowness of rulers\r\n(back'd by the machinery of great parties) are just as eligible to these\r\nStates as to any foreign despotism, kingdom, or empire--there is not a\r\nbit of difference. History is to record those three Presidentiads, and\r\nespecially the administrations of Fillmore and Buchanan, as so far our\r\ntopmost warning and shame. Never were publicly display'd more deform'd,\r\nmediocre, snivelling, unreliable, false-hearted men. Never were these\r\nStates so insulted, and attempted to be betray'd. All the main purposes\r\nfor which the government was establish'd were openly denied. The\r\nperfect equality of slavery with freedom was flauntingly preach'd in the\r\nnorth--nay, the superiority of slavery. The slave trade was proposed\r\nto be renew'd. Everywhere frowns and misunderstandings--everywhere\r\nexasperations and humiliations. (The slavery contest is settled--and the\r\nwar is long over--yet do not those putrid conditions, too many of them,\r\nstill exist? still result in diseases, fevers, wounds--not of war and\r\narmy hospitals--but the wounds and diseases of peace?)\r\n\r\nOut of those generic influences, mainly in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio,\r\n&c., arose the attempt at disunion. To philosophical examination,\r\nthe malignant fever of that war shows its embryonic sources, and\r\nthe original nourishment of its life and growth, in the north. I say\r\nsecession, below the surface, originated and was brought to maturity\r\nin the free States. I allude to the score of years preceding 1860. My\r\ndeliberate opinion is now, that if at the opening of the contest\r\nthe abstract duality-question of _slavery and quiet_ could have been\r\nsubmitted to a direct popular vote, as against their opposite, they\r\nwould have triumphantly carried the day in a majority of the northern\r\nStates--in the large cities, leading off with New York and Philadelphia,\r\nby tremendous majorities. The events of '61 amazed everybody north and\r\nsouth, and burst all prophecies and calculations like bubbles. But even\r\nthen, and during the whole war, the stern fact remains that (not only\r\ndid the north put it down, but) _the secession cause had numerically\r\njust as many sympathizers in the free as in the rebel States_.\r\n\r\nAs to slavery, abstractly and practically, (its idea, and the\r\ndetermination to establish and expand it, especially in the new\r\nterritories, the future America,) it is too common, I repeat, to\r\nidentify it exclusively with the south. In fact down to the opening of\r\nthe war, the whole country had about an equal hand in it. The north had\r\nat least been just as guilty, if not more guilty; and the east and west\r\nhad. The former Presidents and Congresses had been guilty--the governors\r\nand legislatures of every northern State had been guilty, and the mayors\r\nof New York and other northern cities had all been guilty--their hands\r\nwere all stain'd. And as the conflict took decided shape, it is hard\r\nto tell which class, the leading southern or northern disunionists,\r\nwas more stunn'd and disappointed at the non-action of the free-State\r\nsecession element, so largely existing and counted on by those leaders,\r\nboth sections.\r\n\r\nSo much for that point, and for the north. As to the inception and\r\ndirect instigation of the war, in the south itself, I shall not attempt\r\ninteriors or complications. Behind all, the idea that it was from\r\na resolute and arrogant determination on the part of the extreme\r\nslaveholders, the Calhounites, to carry the States-rights' portion\r\nof the constitutional compact to its farthest verge, and nationalize\r\nslavery, or else disrupt the Union, and found a new empire, with slavery\r\nfor its corner-stone, was and is undoubtedly the true theory. (If\r\nsuccessful, this attempt might--I am not sure, but it might--have\r\ndestroy'd not only our American republic, in anything like first-class\r\nproportions, in itself and its prestige, but for ages at least, the\r\ncause of Liberty and Equality everywhere--and would have been the\r\ngreatest triumph of reaction, and the severest blow to political and\r\nevery other freedom, possible to conceive. Its worst result would have\r\ninured to the southern States themselves.) That our national democratic\r\nexperiment, principle, and machinery, could triumphantly sustain such a\r\nshock, and that the Constitution could weather it, like a ship a storm,\r\nand come out of it as sound and whole as before, is by far the most\r\nsignal proof yet of the stability of that experiment, Democracy, and of\r\nthose principles, and that Constitution.\r\n\r\nOf the war itself, we know in the ostent what has been done. The numbers\r\nof the dead and wounded can be told or approximated, the debt posted and\r\nput on record, the material events narrated, &c. Meantime, elections go\r\non, laws are pass'd, political parties struggle, issue their platforms,\r\n&c., just the same as before. But immensest results, not only in\r\npolitics, but in literature, poems, and sociology, are doubtless waiting\r\nyet unform'd in the future. How long they will wait I cannot tell.\r\nThe pageant of history's retrospect shows us, ages since, all Europe\r\nmarching on the crusades, those arm'd uprisings of the people, stirr'd\r\nby a mere idea, to grandest attempt--and, when once baffled in it,\r\nreturning, at intervals, twice, thrice, and again. An unsurpass'd series\r\nof revolutionary events, influences. Yet it took over two hundred years\r\nfor the seeds of the crusades to germinate, before beginning even to\r\nsprout. Two hundred years they lay, sleeping, not dead, but dormant in\r\nthe ground. Then, out of them, unerringly, arts, travel, navigation,\r\npolitics, literature, freedom, the spirit of adventure, inquiry, all\r\narose, grew, and steadily sped on to what we see at present. Far\r\nback there, that huge agitation-struggle of the crusades stands,\r\nas undoubtedly the embryo, the start, of the high preeminence of\r\nexperiment, civilization and enterprise which the European nations have\r\nsince sustain'd, and of which these States are the heirs.\r\n\r\nAnother illustration--(history is full of them, although the war itself,\r\nthe victory of the Union, and the relations of our equal States, present\r\nfeatures of which there are no precedents in the past.) The conquest of\r\nEngland eight centuries ago, by the Franco-Normans--the obliteration of\r\nthe old, (in many respects so needing obliteration)--the Domesday Book,\r\nand the repartition of the land--the old impedimenta removed, even by\r\nblood and ruthless violence, and a new, progressive genesis establish'd,\r\nnew seeds sown--time has proved plain enough that, bitter as they\r\nwere, all these were the most salutary series of revolutions that could\r\npossibly have happen'd. Out of them, and by them mainly, have come,\r\nout of Albic, Roman and Saxon England--and without them could not have\r\ncome--not only the England of the 500 years down to the present, and of\r\nthe present--but these States. Nor, except for that terrible dislocation\r\nand overturn, would these States, as they are, exist to-day.\r\n\r\nIt is certain to me that the United States, by virtue of that war and\r\nits results, and through that and them only, are now ready to enter, and\r\nmust certainly enter, upon their genuine career in history, as no more\r\ntorn and divided in their spinal requisites, but a great homogeneous\r\nNation--free States all--a moral and political unity in variety, such\r\nas Nature shows in her grandest physical works, and as much greater than\r\nany mere work of Nature, as the moral and political, the work of man,\r\nhis mind, his soul, are, in their loftiest sense, greater than the\r\nmerely physical. Out of that war not only has the nationality of the\r\nStates escaped from being strangled, but more than any of the rest, and,\r\nin my opinion, more than the north itself, the vital heart and breath of\r\nthe south have escaped as from the pressure of a general nightmare,\r\nand are henceforth to enter on a life, development, and active freedom,\r\nwhose realities are certain in the future, notwithstanding all the\r\nsouthern vexations of the hour--a development which could not possibly\r\nhave been achiev'd on any less terms, or by any other means than that\r\ngrim lesson, or something equivalent to it. And I predict that the south\r\nis yet to outstrip the north.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACES TO \"LEAVES OF GRASS\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE, 1855 To first issue of Leaves of Grass. _Brooklyn, N.Y._\r\n\r\nAmerica does not repel the past, or what the past has produced under\r\nits forms, or amid other politics, or the idea of castes, or the old\r\nreligions--accepts the lesson with calmness--is not impatient because\r\nthe slough still sticks to opinions and manners in literature, while the\r\nlife which served its requirements has passed into the new life of the\r\nnew forms--perceives that the corpse is slowly borne from the eating and\r\nsleeping rooms of the house--perceives that it waits a little while\r\nin the door--that it was fittest for its days--that its action has\r\ndescended to the stalwart and well-shaped heir who approaches--and that\r\nhe shall be fittest for his days.\r\n\r\nThe Americans of all nations at any time upon the earth, have\r\nprobably the fullest poetical nature. The United States themselves are\r\nessentially the greatest poem. In the history of the earth hitherto,\r\nthe largest and most stirring appear tame and orderly to their ampler\r\nlargeness and stir. Here at last is something in the doings of man that\r\ncorresponds with the broadcast doings of the day and night. Here\r\nis action untied from strings, necessarily blind to particulars and\r\ndetails, magnificently moving in masses. Here is the hospitality which\r\nfor ever indicates heroes. Here the performance, disdaining the trivial,\r\nunapproach'd in the tremendous audacity of its crowds and groupings, and\r\nthe push of its perspective, spreads with crampless and flowing breadth,\r\nand showers its prolific and splendid extravagance. One sees it must\r\nindeed own the riches of the summer and winter, and need never be\r\nbankrupt while corn grows from the ground, or the orchards drop apples,\r\nor the bays contain fish, or men beget children upon women.\r\n\r\nOther states indicate themselves in their deputies--but the genius of\r\nthe United States is not best or most in its executives or legislatures,\r\nnor in its ambassadors or authors, or colleges or churches or parlors,\r\nnor even in its newspapers or inventors--but always most in the common\r\npeople, south, north, west, east, in all its States, through all its\r\nmighty amplitude. The largeness of the nation, however, were monstrous\r\nwithout a corresponding largeness and generosity of the spirit of the\r\ncitizen. Not swarming states, nor streets and steamships, nor prosperous\r\nbusiness, nor farms, nor capital, nor learning, may suffice for the\r\nideal of man--nor suffice the poet. No reminiscences may suffice\r\neither. A live nation can always cut a deep mark, and can have the best\r\nauthority the cheapest--namely, from its own soul. This is the sum of\r\nthe profitable uses of individuals or states, and of present action and\r\ngrandeur, and of the subjects of poets. (As if it were necessary to\r\ntrot back generation after generation to the eastern records! As if the\r\nbeauty and sacredness of the demonstrable must fall behind that of the\r\nmythical! As if men do not make their mark out of any times! As if the\r\nopening of the western continent by discovery, and what has transpired\r\nin North and South America, were less than the small theatre of the\r\nantique, or the aimless sleep-walking of the middle ages!) The pride of\r\nthe United States leaves the wealth and finesse of the cities, and all\r\nreturns of commerce and agriculture, and all the magnitude of geography\r\nor shows of exterior victory, to enjoy the sight and realization of\r\nfull-sized men, or one full-sized man unconquerable and simple. The\r\nAmerican poets are to enclose old and new, for America is the race of\r\nraces. The expression of the American poet is to be transcendent and\r\nnew. It is to be indirect, and not direct or descriptive or epic. Its\r\nquality goes through these to much more. Let the age and wars of other\r\nnations be chanted, and their eras and characters be illustrated, and\r\nthat finish the verse. Not so the great psalm of the republic. Here\r\nthe theme is creative, and has vista. Whatever stagnates in the flat\r\nof custom or obedience or legislation, the great poet never stagnates.\r\nObedience does not master him, he masters it. High up out of reach\r\nhe stands, turning a concentrated light--he turns the pivot with\r\nhis finger--he baffles the swiftest runners as he stands, and easily\r\novertakes and envelopes them. The time straying toward infidelity and\r\nconfections and persiflage he withholds by steady faith. Faith is the\r\nantiseptic of the soul--it pervades the common people and preserves\r\nthem--they never give up believing and expecting and trusting. There\r\nis that indescribable freshness and unconsciousness about an illiterate\r\nperson, that humbles and mocks the power of the noblest expressive\r\ngenius. The poet sees for a certainty how one not a great artist may be\r\njust as sacred and perfect as the greatest artist.\r\n\r\nThe power to destroy or remould is freely used by the greatest poet, but\r\nseldom the power of attack. What is past is past. If he does not expose\r\nsuperior models, and prove himself by every step he takes, he is not\r\nwhat is wanted. The presence of the great poet conquers--not parleying,\r\nor struggling, or any prepared attempts. Now he has passed that way, see\r\nafter him! There is not left any vestige of despair, or misanthropy, or\r\ncunning, or exclusiveness, or the ignominy of a nativity or color, or\r\ndelusion of hell or the necessity of hell--and no man thenceforward\r\nshall be degraded for ignorance or weakness or sin. The greatest poet\r\nhardly knows pettiness or triviality. If he breathes into anything that\r\nwas before thought small, it dilates with the grandeur and life of the\r\nuniverse. He is a seer--he is individual--he is complete in himself--the\r\nothers are as good as he, only he sees it, and they do not. He is\r\nnot one of the chorus--he does not stop for any regulation--he is the\r\npresident of regulation. What the eyesight does to the rest, he does\r\nto the rest. Who knows the curious mystery of the eyesight? The other\r\nsenses corroborate themselves, but this is removed from any proof but\r\nits own, and foreruns the identities of the spiritual world. A\r\nsingle glance of it mocks all the investigations of man, and all\r\nthe instruments and books of the earth, and all reasoning. What\r\nis marvellous? what is unlikely? what is impossible or baseless or\r\nvague--after you have once just open'd the space of a peach-pit, and\r\ngiven audience to far and near, and to the sunset, and had all things\r\nenter with electric swiftness, softly and duly, without confusion or\r\njostling or jam?\r\n\r\nThe land and sea, the animals, fishes and birds, the sky of heaven and\r\nthe orbs, the forests, mountains and rivers, are not small themes--but\r\nfolks expect of the poet to indicate more than the beauty and dignity\r\nwhich always attach to dumb real objects--they expect him to indicate\r\nthe path between reality and their souls. Men and women perceive the\r\nbeauty well enough--probably as well as he. The passionate tenacity of\r\nhunters, woodmen, early risers, cultivators of gardens and orchards and\r\nfields, the love of healthy women for the manly form, seafaring persons,\r\ndrivers of horses, the passion for light and the open air, all is an old\r\nvaried sign of the unfailing perception of beauty, and of a residence\r\nof the poetic in out-door people. They can never be assisted by poets\r\nto perceive--some may, but they never can. The poetic quality is not\r\nmarshal'd in rhyme or uniformity, or abstract addresses to things, nor\r\nin melancholy complaints or good precepts, but is the life of these\r\nand much else, and is in the soul. The profit of rhyme is that it drops\r\nseeds of a sweeter and more luxuriant rhyme, and of uniformity that it\r\nconveys itself into its own roots in the ground out of sight. The rhyme\r\nand uniformity of perfect poems show the free growth of metrical laws,\r\nand bud from them as unerringly and loosely as lilacs and roses on a\r\nbush, and take shapes as compact as the shapes of chestnuts and oranges,\r\nand melons and pears, and shed the perfume impalpable to form. The\r\nfluency and ornaments of the finest poems or music or orations or\r\nrecitations, are not independent but dependent. All beauty comes\r\nfrom beautiful blood and a beautiful brain. If the greatnesses are\r\nin conjunction in a man or woman, it is enough--the fact will prevail\r\nthrough the universe; but the gaggery and gilt of a million years will\r\nnot prevail. Who troubles himself about his ornaments or fluency is\r\nlost. This is what you shall do: Love the earth and sun and the animals,\r\ndespise riches, give alms to every one that asks, stand up for the\r\nstupid and crazy, devote your income and labor to others, hate tyrants,\r\nargue not concerning God, have patience and indulgence toward the\r\npeople, take off your hat to nothing known or unknown, or to any man or\r\nnumber of men--go freely with powerful uneducated persons, and with the\r\nyoung, and with the mothers of families--re-examine all you have been\r\ntold in school or church or in any book, and dismiss whatever insults\r\nyour own soul; and your very flesh shall be a great poem, and have the\r\nrichest fluency, not only in its words, but in the silent lines of its\r\nlips and face, and between the lashes of your eyes, and in every motion\r\nand joint of your body. The poet shall not spend his time in unneeded\r\nwork. He shall know that the ground is already plough'd and manured;\r\nothers may not know it, but he shall. He shall go directly to the\r\ncreation. His trust shall master the trust of everything he touches--and\r\nshall master all attachment.\r\n\r\nThe known universe has one complete lover, and that is the greatest\r\npoet. He consumes an eternal passion, and is indifferent which chance\r\nhappens, and which possible contingency of fortune or misfortune, and\r\npersuades daily and hourly his delicious pay. What balks or breaks\r\nothers is fuel for his burning progress to contact and amorous joy.\r\nOther proportions of the reception of pleasure dwindle to nothing to his\r\nproportions. All expected from heaven or from the highest, he is rapport\r\nwith in the sight of the daybreak, or the scenes of the winter woods,\r\nor the presence of children playing, or with his arm round the neck of a\r\nman or woman. His love above all love has leisure and expanse--he leaves\r\nroom ahead of himself. He is no irresolute or suspicious lover--he is\r\nsure--he scorns intervals. His experience and the showers and thrills\r\nare not for nothing. Nothing can jar him--suffering and darkness\r\ncannot--death and fear cannot. To him complaint and jealousy and envy\r\nare corpses buried and rotten in the earth--he saw them buried. The\r\nsea is not surer of the shore, or the shore of the sea, than he is the\r\nfruition of his love, and of all perfection and beauty.\r\n\r\nThe fruition of beauty is no chance of miss or hit--it is as inevitable\r\nas life--it is exact and plumb as gravitation. From the eyesight\r\nproceeds another eyesight, and from the hearing proceeds another\r\nhearing, and from the voice proceeds another voice, eternally curious of\r\nthe harmony of things with man. These understand the law of perfection\r\nin masses and floods--that it is profuse and impartial--that there is\r\nnot a minute of the light or dark, nor an acre of the earth and sea,\r\nwithout it--nor any direction of the sky, nor any trade or employment,\r\nnor any turn of events. This is the reason that about the proper\r\nexpression of beauty there is precision and balance. One part does not\r\nneed to be thrust above another. The best singer is not the one who has\r\nthe most lithe and powerful organ. The pleasure of poems is not in them\r\nthat take the handsomest measure and sound.\r\n\r\nWithout effort, and without exposing in the least how it is done, the\r\ngreatest poet brings the spirit of any or all events and passions and\r\nscenes and persons, some more and some less, to bear on your individual\r\ncharacter as you hear or read. To do this well is to compete with the\r\nlaws that pursue and follow Time. What is the purpose must surely be\r\nthere, and the clue of it must be there--and the faintest indication is\r\nthe indication of the best, and then becomes the clearest indication.\r\nPast and present and future are not disjoin'd but join'd. The greatest\r\npoet forms the consistence of what is to be, from what has been and is.\r\nHe drags the dead out of their coffins and stands them again on their\r\nfeet. He says to the past, Rise and walk before me that I may realize\r\nyou. He learns the lesson--he places himself where the future becomes\r\npresent. The greatest poet does not only dazzle his rays over character\r\nand scenes and passions--he finally ascends, and finishes all--he\r\nexhibits the pinnacles that no man can tell what they are for, or\r\nwhat is beyond--he glows a moment on the extremest verge. He is most\r\nwonderful in his last half-hidden smile or frown; by that flash of the\r\nmoment of parting the one that sees it shall be encouraged or terrified\r\nafterward for many years. The greatest poet does not moralize or make\r\napplications of morals--he knows the soul. The soul has that measureless\r\npride which consists in never acknowledging any lessons or deductions\r\nbut its own. But it has sympathy as measureless as its pride, and\r\nthe one balances the other, and neither can stretch too far while it\r\nstretches in company with the other. The inmost secrets of art sleep\r\nwith the twain. The greatest poet has lain close betwixt both, and they\r\nare vital in his style and thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe art of art, the glory of expression and the sunshine of the light of\r\nletters, is simplicity. Nothing is better than simplicity--nothing can\r\nmake up for excess, or for the lack of definiteness. To carry on the\r\nheave of impulse and pierce intellectual depths and give all subjects\r\ntheir articulations, are powers neither common nor very uncommon. But\r\nto speak in literature with the perfect rectitude and insouciance of\r\nthe movements of animals, and the unimpeachableness of the sentiment of\r\ntrees in the woods and grass by the roadside, is the flawless triumph\r\nof art. If you have look'd on him who has achiev'd it you have look'd\r\non one of the masters of the artists of all nations and times. You\r\nshall not contemplate the flight of the gray gull over the bay, or the\r\nmettlesome action of the blood horse, or the tall leaning of sunflowers\r\non their stalk, or the appearance of the sun journeying through heaven,\r\nor the appearance of the moon afterward, with any more satisfaction than\r\nyou shall contemplate him. The great poet has less a mark'd style,\r\nand is more the channel of thoughts and things without increase or\r\ndiminution, and is the free channel of himself. He swears to his art, I\r\nwill not be meddlesome, I will not have in my writing any elegance, or\r\neffect, or originality, to hang in the way between me and the rest like\r\ncurtains. I will have nothing hang in the way, not the richest curtains.\r\nWhat I tell I tell for precisely what it is. Let who may exalt or\r\nstartle or fascinate or soothe, I will have purposes as health or heat\r\nor snow has, and be as regardless of observation. What I experience or\r\nportray shall go from my composition without a shred of my composition.\r\nYou shall stand by my side and look in the mirror with me.\r\n\r\nThe old red blood and stainless gentility of great poets will be proved\r\nby their unconstraint. A heroic person walks at his ease through and\r\nout of that custom or precedent or authority that suits him not. Of the\r\ntraits of the brotherhood of first-class writers, savans, musicians,\r\ninventors and artists, nothing is finer than silent defiance advancing\r\nfrom new free forms. In the need of poems, philosophy, politics,\r\nmechanism, science, behavior, the craft of art, an appropriate native\r\ngrand opera, shipcraft, or any craft, he is greatest for ever and ever\r\nwho contributes the greatest original practical example. The cleanest\r\nexpression is that which finds no sphere worthy of itself, and makes\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe messages of great poems to each man and woman are, Come to us on\r\nequal terms, only then can you understand us. We are no better than\r\nyou, what we inclose you inclose, what we enjoy you may enjoy. Did\r\nyou suppose there could be only one Supreme? We affirm there can be\r\nunnumber'd Supremes, and that one does not countervail another any more\r\nthan one eyesight countervails another--and that men can be good or\r\ngrand only of the consciousness of their supremacy within them. What\r\ndo you think is the grandeur of storms and dismemberments, and the\r\ndeadliest battles and wrecks, and the wildest fury of the elements, and\r\nthe power of the sea, and the motion of Nature, and the throes of human\r\ndesires, and dignity and hate and love? It is that something in the\r\nsoul which says, Rage on, whirl on, I tread master here and\r\neverywhere--Master of the spasms of the sky and of the shatter of the\r\nsea, Master of nature and passion and death, and of all terror and all\r\npain.\r\n\r\nThe American bards shall be mark'd for generosity and affection, and\r\nfor encouraging competitors. They shall be Kosmos, without monopoly or\r\nsecrecy, glad to pass anything to any one--hungry for equals night and\r\nday. They shall not be careful of riches and privilege--they shall be\r\nriches and privilege--they shall perceive who the most affluent man\r\nis. The most affluent man is he that confronts all the shows he sees\r\nby equivalents out of the stronger wealth of himself. The American bard\r\nshall delineate no class of persons, nor one or two out of the strata of\r\ninterests, nor love most nor truth most, nor the soul most, nor the body\r\nmost--and not be for the Eastern States more than the Western, or the\r\nNorthern States more than the Southern.\r\n\r\nExact science and its practical movements are no checks on the\r\ngreatest poet, but always his encouragement and support. The outset and\r\nremembrance are there--there the arms that lifted him first, and braced\r\nhim best--there he returns after all his goings and comings. The\r\nsailor and traveler--the anatomist, chemist, astronomer, geologist,\r\nphrenologist, spiritualist, mathematician, historian, and lexicographer,\r\nare not poets, but they are the lawgivers of poets, and their\r\nconstruction underlies the structure of every perfect poem. No matter\r\nwhat rises or is utter'd, they sent the seed of the conception of it--of\r\nthem and by them stand the visible proofs of souls. If there shall be\r\nlove and content between the father and the son, and if the greatness\r\nof the son is the exuding of the greatness of the father, there shall be\r\nlove between the poet and the man of demonstrable science. In the beauty\r\nof poems are henceforth the tuft and final applause of science.\r\n\r\nGreat is the faith of the flush of knowledge, and of the investigation\r\nof the depths of qualities and things. Cleaving and circling here swells\r\nthe soul of the poet, yet is president of itself always. The depths\r\nare fathomless, and therefore calm. The innocence and nakedness are\r\nresumed--they are neither modest nor immodest. The whole theory of\r\nthe supernatural, and all that was twined with it or educed out of it,\r\ndeparts as a dream. What has ever happen'd--what happens, and whatever\r\nmay or shall happen, the vital laws inclose all. They are sufficient for\r\nany case and for all cases--none to be hurried or retarded--any special\r\nmiracle of affairs or persons inadmissible in the vast clear scheme\r\nwhere every motion and every spear of grass, and the frames and spirits\r\nof men and women and all that concerns them, are unspeakably perfect\r\nmiracles, all referring to all, and each distinct and in its place. It\r\nis also not consistent with the reality of the soul to admit that there\r\nis anything in the known universe more divine than men and women.\r\n\r\nMen and women, and the earth and all upon it, are to be taken as they\r\nare, and the investigation of their past and present and future shall\r\nbe unintermitted, and shall be done with perfect candor. Upon this basis\r\nphilosophy speculates, ever looking towards the poet, ever regarding the\r\neternal tendencies of all toward happiness, never inconsistent with what\r\nis clear to the senses and to the soul. For the eternal tendencies of\r\nall toward happiness make the only point of sane philosophy. Whatever\r\ncomprehends less than that--whatever is less than the laws of light and\r\nof astronomical motion--or less than the laws that follow the thief,\r\nthe liar, the glutton and the drunkard, through this life and doubtless\r\nafterward--or less than vast stretches of time, or the slow formation of\r\ndensity, or the patient upheaving of strata--is of no account. Whatever\r\nwould put God in a poem or system of philosophy as contending against\r\nsome being or influence, is also of no account. Sanity and ensemble\r\ncharacterize the great master--spoilt in one principle, all is spoilt.\r\nThe great master has nothing to do with miracles. He sees health\r\nfor himself in being one of the mass--he sees the hiatus in singular\r\neminence. To the perfect shape comes common ground. To be under the\r\ngeneral law is great, for that is to correspond with it. The master\r\nknows that he is unspeakably great, and that all are unspeakably\r\ngreat--that nothing, for instance, is greater than to conceive children,\r\nand bring them up well--that to _be_ is just as great as to perceive or\r\ntell.\r\n\r\nIn the make of the great masters the idea of political liberty is\r\nindispensable. Liberty takes the adherence of heroes wherever man and\r\nwoman exist--but never takes any adherence or welcome from the rest more\r\nthan from poets. They are the voice and exposition of liberty. They out\r\nof ages are worthy the grand idea--to them it is confided, and they\r\nmust sustain it. Nothing has precedence of it, and nothing can warp or\r\ndegrade it.\r\n\r\nAs the attributes of the poets of the kosmos concentre in the real\r\nbody, and in the pleasure of things, they possess the superiority of\r\ngenuineness over all fiction and romance. As they emit themselves, facts\r\nare shower'd over with light--the daylight is lit with more volatile\r\nlight--the deep between the setting and rising sun goes deeper many\r\nfold. Each precise object or condition or combination or process\r\nexhibits a beauty--the multiplication table its--old age its--the\r\ncarpenter's trade its--the grand opera its--the huge-hull'd clean-shap'd\r\nNew York clipper at sea under steam or full sail gleams with unmatch'd\r\nbeauty--the American circles and large harmonies of government gleam\r\nwith theirs--and the commonest definite intentions and actions with\r\ntheirs. The poets of the kosmos advance through all interpositions and\r\ncoverings and turmoils and stratagems to first principles. They are of\r\nuse--they dissolve poverty from its need, and riches from its conceit.\r\nYou large proprietor, they say, shall not realize or perceive more than\r\nany one else. The owner of the library is not he who holds a legal title\r\nto it, having bought and paid for it. Any one and every one is owner of\r\nthe library, (indeed he or she alone is owner,) who can read the same\r\nthrough all the varieties of tongues and subjects and styles, and in\r\nwhom they enter with ease, and make supple and powerful and rich and\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\nThese American States, strong and healthy and accomplish'd, shall\r\nreceive no pleasure from violations of natural models, and must not\r\npermit them. In paintings or mouldings or carvings in mineral or wood,\r\nor in the illustrations of books or newspapers, or in the patterns of\r\nwoven stuffs, or anything to beautify rooms or furniture or costumes, or\r\nto put upon cornices or monuments, or on the prows or sterns of ships,\r\nor to put anywhere before the human eye indoors or out, that which\r\ndistorts honest shapes, or which creates unearthly beings or places or\r\ncontingencies, is a nuisance and revolt. Of the human form especially,\r\nit is so great it must never be made ridiculous. Of ornaments to a work\r\nnothing outre can be allow'd--but those ornaments can be allow'd that\r\nconform to the perfect facts of the open air, and that flow out of the\r\nnature of the work, and come irrepressibly from it, and are necessary\r\nto the completion of the work. Most works are most beautiful without\r\nornament. Exaggerations will be revenged in human physiology. Clean and\r\nvigorous children are jetted and conceiv'd only in those communities\r\nwhere the models of natural forms are public every day. Great genius and\r\nthe people of these States must never be demean'd to romances. As soon\r\nas histories are properly told, no more need of romances.\r\n\r\nThe great poets are to be known by the absence in them of tricks, and by\r\nthe justification of perfect personal candor. All faults may be forgiven\r\nof him who has perfect candor. Henceforth let no man of us lie, for we\r\nhave seen that openness wins the inner and outer world, and that there\r\nis no single exception, and that never since our earth gather'd itself\r\nin a mass have deceit or subterfuge or prevarication attracted its\r\nsmallest particle or the faintest tinge of a shade--and that through the\r\nenveloping wealth and rank of a state, or the whole republic of states,\r\na sneak or sly person shall be discover'd and despised--and that the\r\nsoul has never once been fool'd and never can be fool'd--and thrift\r\nwithout the loving nod of the soul is only a foetid puff--and there\r\nnever grew up in any of the continents of the globe, nor upon any planet\r\nor satellite, nor in that condition which precedes the birth of babes,\r\nnor at any time during the changes of life, nor in any stretch of\r\nabeyance or action of vitality, nor in any process of formation or\r\nreformation anywhere, a being whose instinct hated the truth.\r\n\r\nExtreme caution or prudence, the soundest organic health, large hope and\r\ncomparison and fondness for women and children, large alimentiveness\r\nand destuctiveness and causality, with a perfect sense of the oneness of\r\nnature, and the propriety of the same spirit applied to human affairs,\r\nare called up of the float of the brain of the world to be parts of\r\nthe greatest poet from his birth out of his mother's womb, and from her\r\nbirth out of her mother's. Caution seldom goes far enough. It has been\r\nthought that the prudent citizen was the citizen who applied himself to\r\nsolid gains, and did well for himself and for his family, and completed\r\na lawful life without debt or crime. The greatest poet sees and admits\r\nthese economies as he sees the economies of food and sleep, but has\r\nhigher notions of prudence than to think he gives much when he gives\r\na few slight attentions at the latch of the gate. The premises of the\r\nprudence of life are not the hospitality of it, or the ripeness and\r\nharvest of it. Beyond the independence of a little sum laid aside for\r\nburial-money, and of a few clap-boards around and shingles overhead on a\r\nlot of American soil own'd, and the easy dollars that supply the year's\r\nplain clothing and meals, the melancholy prudence of the abandonment\r\nof such a great being as a man is, to the toss and pallor of years of\r\nmoney-making, with all their scorching days and icy nights, and all\r\ntheir stifling deceits and underhand dodgings, or infinitesimals of\r\nparlors, or shameless stuffing while others starve, and all the loss of\r\nthe bloom and odor of the earth, and of the flowers and atmosphere, and\r\nof the sea, and of the true taste of the women and men you pass or\r\nhave to do with in youth or middle age, and the issuing sickness and\r\ndesperate revolt at the close of a life without elevation or naivety,\r\n(even if you have achiev'd a secure 10,000 a year, or election to\r\nCongress or the Governorship,) and the ghastly chatter of a death\r\nwithout serenity or majesty, is the great fraud upon modern civilization\r\nand forethought, blotching the surface and system which civilization\r\nundeniably drafts, and moistening with tears the immense features it\r\nspreads and spreads with such velocity before the reach'd kisses of the\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nEver the right explanation remains to be made about prudence. The\r\nprudence of the mere wealth and respectability of the most esteem'd life\r\nappears too faint for the eye to observe at all, when little and large\r\nalike drop quietly aside at the thought of the prudence suitable for\r\nimmortality. What is the wisdom that fills the thinness of a year, or\r\nseventy or eighty years--to the wisdom spaced out by ages, and coming\r\nback at a certain time with strong reinforcements and rich presents,\r\nand the clear faces of wedding-guests as far as you can look, in every\r\ndirection, running gaily toward you? Only the soul is of itself--all\r\nelse has reference to what ensues. All that a person does or thinks is\r\nof consequence. Nor can the push of charity or personal force ever be\r\nanything else' than the profoundest reason, whether it brings argument\r\nto hand or no. No specification is necessary--to add or subtract or\r\ndivide is in vain. Little or big, learn'd or unlearn'd, white or black,\r\nlegal or illegal, sick or well, from the first inspiration down the\r\nwindpipe to the last expiration out of it, all that a male or female\r\ndoes that is vigorous and benevolent and clean is so much sure profit\r\nto him or her in the unshakable order of the universe, and through the\r\nwhole scope of it forever. The prudence of the greatest poet answers\r\nat last the craving and glut of the soul, puts off nothing, permits\r\nno let-up for its own case or any case, has no particular sabbath or\r\njudgment day, divides not the living from the dead, or the righteous\r\nfrom the unrighteous, is satisfied with the present, matches every\r\nthought or act by its correlative, and knows no possible forgiveness or\r\ndeputed atonement.\r\n\r\nThe direct trial of him who would be the greatest poet is to-day. If\r\nhe does not flood himself with the immediate age as with vast oceanic\r\ntides--if he be not himself the age transfigur'd, and if to him is not\r\nopen'd the eternity which gives similitude to all periods and locations\r\nand processes, and animate and inanimate forms, and which is the bond of\r\ntime, and rises up from its inconceivable vagueness and infiniteness\r\nin the swimming shapes of to-day, and is held by the ductile anchors of\r\nlife, and makes the present spot the passage from what was to what shall\r\nbe, and commits itself to the representation of this wave of an hour,\r\nand this one of the sixty beautiful children of the wave--let him merge\r\nin the general run, and wait his development.\r\n\r\nStill the final test of poems, or any character or work, remains. The\r\nprescient poet projects himself centuries ahead, and judges performer or\r\nperformance after the changes of time. Does it live through them? Does\r\nit still hold on untired? Will the same style, and the direction of\r\ngenius to similar points, be satisfactory now? Have the marches of tens\r\nand hundreds and thousands of years made willing detours to the right\r\nhand and the left hand for his sake? Is he beloved long and long after\r\nhe is buried? Does the young man think often of him? and the young woman\r\nthink often of him? and do the middleaged and the old think of him?\r\n\r\nA great poem is for ages and ages in common, and for all degrees and\r\ncomplexions, and all departments and sects, and for a woman as much as a\r\nman, and a man as much as a woman. A great poem is no finish to a man or\r\nwoman, but rather a beginning. Has any one fancied he could sit at last\r\nunder some due authority, and rest satisfied with explanations, and\r\nrealize, and be content and full? To no such terminus does the greatest\r\npoet bring--he brings neither cessation nor shelter'd fatness and ease.\r\nThe touch of him, like Nature, tells in action. Whom he takes he\r\ntakes with firm sure grasp into live regions previously\r\nunattain'd--thenceforward is no rest--they see the space and ineffable\r\nsheen that turn the old spots and lights into dead vacuums. Now there\r\nshall be a man cohered out of tumult and chaos--the elder encourages the\r\nyounger and shows him how--they two shall launch off fearlessly together\r\ntill the new world fits an orbit for itself, and looks unabash'd on the\r\nlesser orbits of the stars, and sweeps through the ceaseless rings, and\r\nshall never be quiet again.\r\n\r\nThere will soon be no more priests. Their work is done. A new order\r\nshall arise, and they shall be the priests of man, and every man shall\r\nbe his own priest. They shall find their inspiration in real objects\r\nto-day, symptoms of the past and future. They shall not deign to defend\r\nimmortality or God, or the perfection of things, or liberty, or the\r\nexquisite beauty and reality of the soul. They shall arise in America,\r\nand be responded to from the remainder of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe English language befriends the grand American expression--it is\r\nbrawny enough, and limber and full enough. On the tough stock of a race\r\nwho through all change of circumstance was never without the idea of\r\npolitical liberty, which is the animus of all liberty, it has attracted\r\nthe terms of daintier and gayer and subtler and more elegant tongues.\r\nIt is the powerful language of resistance--it is the dialect of common\r\nsense. It is the speech of the proud and melancholy races, and of\r\nall who aspire. It is the chosen tongue to express growth, faith,\r\nself-esteem, freedom, justice, equality, friendliness, amplitude,\r\nprudence, decision, and courage. It is the medium that shall wellnigh\r\nexpress the inexpressible.\r\n\r\nNo great literature, nor any like style of behavior or oratory, or\r\nsocial intercourse or household arrangements, or public institutions,\r\nor the treatment by bosses of employ'd people, nor executive detail,\r\nor detail of the army and navy, nor spirit of legislation or courts,\r\nor police or tuition or architecture, or songs or amusements, can long\r\nelude the jealous and passionate instinct of American standards. Whether\r\nor no the sign appears from the mouths of the people, it throbs a live\r\ninterrogation in every freeman's and freewoman's heart, after that which\r\npasses by, or this built to remain. Is it uniform with my country?\r\nAre its disposals without ignominious distinctions? Is it for the\r\never-growing communes of brothers and lovers, large, well united, proud,\r\nbeyond the old models, generous beyond all models? Is it something grown\r\nfresh out of the fields, or drawn from the sea for use to me to-day\r\nhere? I know that what answers for me, an American, in Texas, Ohio,\r\nCanada, must answer for any individual or nation that serves for a part\r\nof my materials. Does this answer? Is it for the nursing of the young of\r\nthe republic? Does it solve readily with the sweet milk of the nipples\r\nof the breasts of the Mother of Many Children?\r\n\r\nAmerica prepares with Composure and good-will for the visitors that have\r\nsent word. It is not intellect that is to be their warrant and welcome.\r\nThe talented, the artist, the ingenious, the editor, the statesman, the\r\nerudite, are not unappreciated--they fall in their place and do their\r\nwork. The soul of the nation also does its work. It rejects none, it\r\npermits all. Only toward the like of itself will it advance half-way. An\r\nindividual is as superb as a nation when he has the qualities which make\r\na superb nation. The soul of the largest and wealthiest and proudest\r\nnation may well go half-way to meet that of its poets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE, 1872 To As a Strong Bird on Pinions Free Now Thou Mother with\r\nthy Equal Brood, _in permanent edition_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe impetus and ideas urging me, for some years past, to an utterance,\r\nor attempt at utterance, of New World songs, and an epic of Democracy,\r\nhaving already had their publish'd expression, as well as I can expect\r\nto give it, in \"Leaves of Grass,\" the present and any future pieces from\r\nme are really but the surplusage forming after that volume, or the wake\r\neddying behind it. I fulfill'd in that an imperious conviction, and the\r\ncommands of my nature as total and irresistible as those which make\r\nthe sea flow, or the globe revolve. But of this supplementary volume,\r\nI confess I am not so certain. Having from early manhood abandon'd the\r\nbusiness pursuits and applications usual in my time and country, and\r\nobediently yielded myself up ever since to the impetus mention'd, and\r\nto the work of expressing those ideas, it may be that mere habit has got\r\ndominion of me, when there is no real need of saying anything further.\r\nBut what is life but an experiment? and mortality but an exercise? with\r\nreference to results beyond. And so shall my poems be. If incomplete\r\nhere, and superfluous there, _n' importe_--the earnest trial and\r\npersistent exploration shall at least be mine, and other success failing\r\nshall be success enough. I have been more anxious, anyhow, to suggest\r\nthe songs of vital endeavor and manly evolution, and furnish something\r\nfor races of outdoor athletes, than to make perfect rhymes, or reign\r\nin the parlors. I ventur'd from the beginning my own way, taking\r\nchances--and would keep on venturing.\r\n\r\nI will therefore not conceal from any persons, known or unknown to me,\r\nwho take an interest in the matter, that I have the ambition of devoting\r\nyet a few years to poetic composition. The mighty present age! To absorb\r\nand express in poetry, anything of it--of its world--America--cities and\r\nStates--the years, the events of our Nineteeth century--the rapidity\r\nof movement--the violent contrasts, fluctuations of light and shade,\r\nof hope and fear--the entire revolution made by science in the poetic\r\nmethod--these great new underlying facts and new ideas rushing and\r\nspreading everywhere;--truly a mighty age! As if in some colossal drama,\r\nacted again like those of old under the open sun, the Nations of our\r\ntime, and all the characteristics of Civilization, seem hurrying,\r\nstalking across, flitting from wing to wing, gathering, closing up,\r\ntoward some long-prepared, most tremendous denouement. Not to conclude\r\nthe infinite scenas of the race's life and toil and happiness and\r\nsorrow, but haply that the boards be clear'd from oldest, worst\r\nincumbrances, accumulations, and Man resume the eternal play anew, and\r\nunder happier, freer auspices. To me, the United States are important\r\nbecause in this colossal drama they are unquestionably designated for\r\nthe leading parts, for many a century to come. In them history and\r\nhumanity seem to seek to culminate. Our broad areas are even now the\r\nbusy theatre of plots, passions, interests, and suspended problems,\r\ncompared to which the intrigues of the past of Europe, the wars of\r\ndynasties, the scope of kings and kingdoms, and even the development of\r\npeoples, as hitherto, exhibit scales of measurement comparatively narrow\r\nand trivial. And on these areas of ours, as on a stage, sooner or later,\r\nsomething like an _eclairissement_ of all the past civilization of\r\nEurope and Asia is probably to be evolved.\r\n\r\nThe leading parts. Not to be acted, emulated here, by us again, that\r\nrole till now foremost in history--not to become a conqueror nation,\r\nor to achieve the glory of mere military, or diplomatic, or commercial\r\nsuperiority--but to become the grand producing land of nobler men and\r\nwomen--of copious races, cheerful, healthy, tolerant, free--to become\r\nthe most friendly nation, (the United States indeed)--the modern\r\ncomposite nation, form'd from all, with room for all, welcoming all\r\nimmigrants--accepting the work of our own interior development, as the\r\nwork fitly filling ages and ages to come;--the leading nation of peace,\r\nbut neither ignorant nor incapable of being the leading nation of\r\nwar;--not the man's nation only, but the woman's nation--a land of\r\nsplendid mothers, daughters, sisters, wives.\r\n\r\nOur America to-day I consider in many respects as but indeed a vast\r\nseething mass of _materials_, ampler, better, (worse also,) than\r\npreviously known--eligible to be used to carry towards its crowning\r\nstage, and build for good, the great ideal nationality of the future,\r\nthe nation of the body and the soul,[32]--no limit here to land, help,\r\nopportunities, mines, products, demands, supplies, etc.;--with (I think)\r\nour political organization, National, State, and Municipal, permanently\r\nestablish'd, as far ahead as we can calculate--but, so far, no social,\r\nliterary, religious, or esthetic organizations, consistent with our\r\npolitics, or becoming to us--which organizations can only come, in time,\r\nthrough great democratic ideas, religion--through science, which now,\r\nlike a new sunrise, ascending, begins to illuminate all--and through our\r\nown begotten poets and literatuses. (The moral of a late well-written\r\nbook on civilization seems to be that the only real foundation-walls and\r\nbases--and also _sine qua non_ afterward--of true and full civilization,\r\nis the eligibility and certainty of boundless products for feeding,\r\nclothing, sheltering everybody--perennial fountains of physical\r\nand domestic comfort, with intercommunication, and with civil and\r\necclesiastical freedom--and that then the esthetic and mental business\r\nwill take care of itself. Well, the United States have establish'd this\r\nbasis, and upon scales of extent, variety, vitality, and continuity,\r\nrivaling those of Nature; and have now to proceed to build an\r\nedifice upon it. I say this edifice is only to be fitly built by new\r\nliteratures, especially the poetic. I say a modern image-making creation\r\nis indispensable to fuse and express the modern political and scientific\r\ncreations--and then the trinity will be complete.)\r\n\r\nWhen I commenced, years ago, elaborating the plan of my poems, and\r\ncontinued turning over that plan, and shifting it in my mind through\r\nmany years, (from the age of twenty-eight to thirty-five,) experimenting\r\nmuch, and writing and abandoning much, one deep purpose underlay the\r\nothers, and has underlain it and its execution ever since--and that has\r\nbeen the religious purpose. Amid many changes, and a formulation taking\r\nfar different shape from what I at first supposed, this basic purpose\r\nhas never been departed from in the composition of my verses. Not of\r\ncourse to exhibit itself in the old ways, as in writing hymns or psalms\r\nwith an eye to the church-pew, or to express conventional pietism, or\r\nthe sickly yearnings of devotees, but in new ways, and aiming at the\r\nwidest sub-bases and inclusions of humanity, and tallying the fresh air\r\nof sea and land. I will see, (said I to myself,) whether there is not,\r\nfor my purposes as poet, a religion, and a sound religious germenancy\r\nin the average human race, at least in their modern development in the\r\nUnited States, and in the hardy common fiber and native yearnings and\r\nelements, deeper and larger, and affording more profitable returns, than\r\nall mere sects or churches--as boundless, joyous, and vital as Nature\r\nitself--a germenancy that has too long been unencouraged, unsung, almost\r\nunknown. With science, the old theology of the East, long in its dotage,\r\nbegins evidently to die and disappear. But (to my mind) science--and\r\nmay-be such will prove its principal service--as evidently prepares\r\nthe way for One indescribably grander--Time's young but perfect\r\noffspring--the new theology--heir of the West--lusty and loving, and\r\nwondrous beautiful. For America, and for today, just the same as any\r\nday, the supreme and final science is the science of God--what we call\r\nscience being only its minister--as Democracy is, or shall be also. And\r\na poet of America (I said) must fill himself with such thoughts, and\r\nchant his best out of them. And as those were the convictions and aims,\r\nfor good or bad, of \"Leaves of Grass,\" they are no less the intention\r\nof this volume. As there can be, in my opinion, no sane and complete\r\npersonality, nor any grand and electric nationality, without the stock\r\nelement of religion imbuing all the other elements, (like heat in\r\nchemistry, invisible itself, but the life of all visible life,) so there\r\ncan be no poetry worthy the name without that element behind all. The\r\ntime has certainly come to begin to discharge the idea of religion,\r\nin the United States, from mere ecclesiasticism, and from Sundays and\r\nchurches and church-going, and assign it to that general position,\r\nchiefest, most indispensable, most exhilarating, to which the others\r\nare to be adjusted, inside of all human character, and education, and\r\naffairs. The people, especially the young men and women of America,\r\nmust begin to learn that religion, (like poetry,) is something far, far\r\ndifferent from what they supposed. It is, indeed, too important to the\r\npower and perpetuity of the New World to be consign'd any longer to the\r\nchurches, old or new, Catholic or Protestant--Saint this, or Saint\r\nthat. It must be consign'd henceforth to democracy _en masse_, and to\r\nliterature. It must enter into the poems of the nation. It must make the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nThe Four Years' War is over--and in the peaceful, strong, exciting,\r\nfresh occasions of to-day, and of the future, that strange, sad war is\r\nhurrying even now to be forgotten. The camp, the drill, the lines of\r\nsentries, the prisons, the hospitals--(ah! the hospitals!)--all have\r\npassed away--all seem now like a dream. A new race, a young and lusty\r\ngeneration, already sweeps in with oceanic currents, obliterating the\r\nwar, and all its scars, its mounded graves, and all its reminiscences of\r\nhatred, conflict, death. So let It be obliterated. I say the life of the\r\npresent and the future makes undeniable demands upon us each and all,\r\nsouth, north, east, west. To help put the United States (even if only in\r\nimagination) hand in hand, in one unbroken circle in a chant--to rouse\r\nthem to the unprecedented grandeur of the part they are to play, and are\r\neven now playing--to the thought of their great future, and the attitude\r\nconform'd to it--especially their great esthetic, moral, scientific\r\nfuture, (of which their vulgar material and political present is but\r\nas the preparatory tuning of instruments by an orchestra,) these, as\r\nhitherto, are still, for me, among my hopes, ambitions.\r\n\r\n\"Leaves of Grass,\" already publish'd, is, in its intentions, the song of\r\na great composite _democratic individual_, male or female. And following\r\non and amplifying the same purpose, I suppose I have in my mind to\r\nrun through the chants of this volume, (if ever completed,) the\r\nthread-voice, more or less audible, of an aggregated, inseparable,\r\nunprecedented, vast, composite, electric _democratic nationality_.\r\n\r\nPurposing, then, to still fill out, from time to time through years to\r\ncome, the following volume, (unless prevented,) I conclude this\r\npreface to the first instalment of it, pencil'd in the open air, on my\r\nfifty-third birth-day, by wafting to you, dear reader, whoever you are,\r\n(from amid the fresh scent of the grass, the pleasant coolness of the\r\nforenoon breeze, the lights and shades of tree-boughs silently dappling\r\nand playing around me, and the notes of the cat-bird for undertone and\r\naccompaniment,) my true good-will and love. W. W. _Washington, D. C.,\r\nMay_ 31, 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n[32] The problems of the achievements of this crowning stage through\r\nfuture first-class National Singers, Orators, Artists, and others--of\r\ncreating in literature an _imaginative_ New World, the correspondent and\r\ncounterpart of the current Scientific and Political New Worlds,--and the\r\nperhaps distant, but still delightful prospect, (for our children, if\r\nnot in our own day,) of delivering America, and, indeed, all Christian\r\nlands everywhere, from the thin moribund and watery, but appallingly\r\nextensive nuisance of conventional poetry--by putting something really\r\nalive and substantial in its place--I have undertaken to grapple with,\r\nand argue, in the preceding \"Democratic Vistas.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE, 1876 _To the two-volume Centennial Edition of_ Leaves of Grass\r\n_and_ Two Rivulets.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the eleventh hour, under grave illness, I gather up the pieces of\r\nprose and poetry left over since publishing, a while since, my first and\r\nmain volume, \"Leaves or Grass\"--pieces, here, some new, some old--nearly\r\nall of them (sombre as many are, making this almost death's book)\r\ncomposed in by-gone atmospheres of perfect health--and preceded by\r\nthe freshest collection, the little \"Two Rivulets,\" now send them\r\nout, embodied in the present melange, partly as my contribution and\r\noutpouring to celebrate, in some sort, the feature of the time, the\r\nfirst centennial of our New World nationality--and then as chyle and\r\nnutriment to that moral, indissoluble union, equally representing all,\r\nand the mother of many coming centennials.\r\n\r\nAnd e'en for flush and proof of our America--for reminder, just as much,\r\nor more, in moods of towering pride and joy, I keep my special chants of\r\ndeath and immortality[33] to stamp the coloring-finish of all, present\r\nand past. For terminus and temperer to all, they were originally\r\nwritten; and that shall be their office at the last.\r\n\r\nFor some reason--not explainable or definite to my own mind, yet\r\nsecretly pleasing and satisfactory to it--I have not hesitated to\r\nembody in, and run through the volume, two altogether distinct veins,\r\nor strata--politics for one, and for the other, the pensive thought\r\nof immortality. Thus, too, the prose and poetic, the dual forms of the\r\npresent book. The volume, therefore, after its minor episodes, probably\r\ndivides into these two, at first sight far diverse, veins of topic and\r\ntreatment. Three points, in especial, have become very dear to me,\r\nand all through I seek to make them again and again, in many forms and\r\nrepetitions, as will be seen: 1. That the true growth-characteristics\r\nof the democracy of the New World are henceforth to radiate in superior\r\nliterary, artistic and religious expressions, far more than in its\r\nrepublican forms, universal suffrage, and frequent elections, (though\r\nthese are unspeakably important.) 2. That the vital political mission of\r\nthe United States is, to practically solve and settle the problem of\r\ntwo sets of rights--the fusion, thorough compatibility and junction\r\nof individual State prerogatives, with the indispensable necessity\r\nof centrality and Oneness--the national identity power--the sovereign\r\nUnion, relentless, permanently comprising all, and over all, and in that\r\nnever yielding an inch: then 3d. Do we not, amid a general malaria of\r\nfogs and vapors, our day, unmistakably see two pillars of promise, with\r\ngrandest, indestructible indications--one, that the morbid facts of\r\nAmerican politics and society everywhere are but passing incidents and\r\nflanges of our unbounded impetus of growth? weeds, annuals, of the rank,\r\nrich soil--not central, enduring, perennial things? The other, that all\r\nthe hitherto experience of the States, their first century, has been\r\nbut preparation, adolescence--and that this Union is only now and\r\nhenceforth, (_i.e._, since the secession war,) to enter on its full\r\ndemocratic career?\r\n\r\nOf the whole, poems and prose, (not attending at all to chronological\r\norder, and with original dates and passing allusions in the heat and\r\nimpression of the hour, left shuffled in, and undisturb'd,) the chants\r\nof \"Leaves of Grass,\" my former volume, yet serve as the indispensable\r\ndeep soil, or basis, out of which, and out of which only, could come the\r\nroots and stems more definitely indicated by these later pages. (While\r\nthat volume radiates physiology alone, the present one, though of the\r\nlike origin in the main, more palpably doubtless shows the pathology\r\nwhich was pretty sure to come in time from the other.)\r\n\r\nIn that former and main volume, composed in the flush of my health and\r\nstrength, from the age of 30 to 50 years, I dwelt on birth and life,\r\nclothing my ideas in pictures, days, transactions of my time, to give\r\nthem positive place, identity--saturating them with that vehemence\r\nof pride and audacity of freedom necessary to loosen the mind\r\nof still-to-be-form'd America from the accumulated folds, the\r\nsuperstitions, and all the long, tenacious and stifling anti-democratic\r\nauthorities of the Asiatic and European past--my enclosing purport being\r\nto express, above all artificial regulation and aid, the eternal bodily\r\ncomposite, cumulative, natural character of one's self.[34]\r\n\r\nEstimating the American Union as so far, and for some time to come, in\r\nits yet formative condition, I bequeath poems and essays as nutriment\r\nand influences to help truly assimilate and harden, and especially to\r\nfurnish something toward what the States most need of all, and which\r\nseems to me yet quite unsupplied in literature, namely, to show them, or\r\nbegin to show them, themselves distinctively, and what they are for.\r\nFor though perhaps the main points of all ages and nations are points of\r\nresemblance, and, even while granting evolution, are substantially the\r\nsame, there are some vital things in which this Republic, as to its\r\nindividualities, and as a compacted Nation, is to specially stand forth,\r\nand culminate modern humanity. And these are the very things it least\r\nmorally and mentally knows--(though, curiously enough, it is at the same\r\ntime faithfully acting upon them.)\r\n\r\nI count with such absolute certainty on the great future of the United\r\nStates--different from, though founded on, the past--that I have always\r\ninvoked that future, and surrounded myself with it, before or while\r\nsinging my songs. (As ever, all tends to followings--America, too, is a\r\nprophecy. What, even of the best and most successful, would be justified\r\nby itself alone? by the present, or the material ostent alone? Of men or\r\nStates, few realize how much they live in the future. That, rising\r\nlike pinnacles, gives its main significance to all You and I are doing\r\nto-day. Without it, there were little meaning in lands or poems--little\r\npurport in human lives. All ages, all Nations and States, have been such\r\nprophecies. But where any former ones with prophecy so broad, so clear,\r\nas our times, our lands--as those of the West?)\r\n\r\nWithout being a scientist, I have thoroughly adopted the conclusions\r\nof the great savants and experimentalists of our time, and of the last\r\nhundred years, and they have interiorly tinged the chyle of all my\r\nverse, for purposes beyond. Following the modern spirit, the real poems\r\nof the present, ever solidifying and expanding into the future, must\r\nvocalize the vastness and splendor and reality with which scientism has\r\ninvested man and the universe, (all that is called creation) and\r\nmust henceforth launch humanity into new orbits, consonant, with that\r\nvastness, splendor, and reality, (unknown to the old poems,) like new\r\nsystems of orbs, balanced upon themselves, revolving in limitless space,\r\nmore subtle than the stars. Poetry, so largely hitherto and even at\r\npresent wedded to children's tales, and to mere amorousness, upholstery\r\nand superficial rhyme, will have to accept, and, while not denying the\r\npast, nor the themes of the past, will be revivified by this tremendous\r\ninnovation, the kosmic spirit, which must henceforth, in my opinion,\r\nbe the background and underlying impetus, more or less visible, of all\r\nfirst-class songs.\r\n\r\nOnly, (for me, at any rate, in all my prose and poetry,) joyfully\r\naccepting modern science, and loyally following it without the slightest\r\nhesitation, there remains ever recognized still a higher flight, a\r\nhigher fact, the eternal soul of man, (of all else too,) the spiritual,\r\nthe religious--which it is to be the greatest office of scientism, in my\r\nopinion, and of future poetry also, to free from fables, crudities and\r\nsuperstitions, and launch forth in renew'd faith and scope a hundred\r\nfold. To me, the worlds of religiousness, of the conception of the\r\ndivine, and of the ideal, though mainly latent, are just as absolute in\r\nhumanity and the universe as the world of chemistry, or anything in the\r\nobjective worlds. To me\r\n\r\n      The prophet and the bard,\r\n    Shall yet maintain themselves--in higher circles yet,\r\n    Shall mediate to the modern, to democracy--interpret yet to them,\r\n      God and eidólons.\r\n\r\nTo me, the crown of savantism is to be, that it surely opens the way for\r\na more splendid theology, and for ampler and diviner songs. No year, nor\r\neven century, will settle this. There is a phase of the real, lurking\r\nbehind the real, which it is all for. There is also in the intellect of\r\nman, in time, far in prospective recesses, a judgment, a last appellate\r\ncourt, which will settle it.\r\n\r\nIn certain parts in these flights, or attempting to depict or suggest\r\nthem, I have not been afraid of the charge of obscurity, in either of\r\nmy two volumes-because human thought, poetry or melody, must leave dim\r\nescapes and outlets-must possess a certain fluid, aerial character,\r\nakin to space itself, obscure to those of little or no imagination,--but\r\nindispensable to the highest purposes. Poetic style, when address'd to\r\nthe soul, is less definite form, outline, sculpture, and becomes vista,\r\nmusic, half-tints, and even less than half-tints. True, it may be\r\narchitecture; but again it may be the forest wild-wood, or the best\r\neffect thereof, at twilight, the waving oaks and cedars in the wind, and\r\nthe impalpable odor.\r\n\r\nFinally, as I have lived in fresh lands, inchoate, and in a\r\nrevolutionary age, future-founding, I have felt to identify the points\r\nof that age, these lands, in my recitatives, altogether in my own way.\r\nThus my form has strictly grown from my purports and facts, and is the\r\nanalogy of them. Within my time the United States have emerged from\r\nnebulous vagueness and suspense, to full orbic, (though varied,)\r\ndecision--have done the deeds and achiev'd the triumphs of half a score\r\nof centuries--and are henceforth to enter upon their real history the\r\nway being now, (_i.e._ since the result of the secession war,) clear'd\r\nof death-threatening impedimenta, and the free areas around and ahead\r\nof us assured and certain, which were not so before--(the past century\r\nbeing but preparations, trial voyages and experiments of the ship,\r\nbefore her starting out upon deep water.)\r\n\r\nIn estimating my volumes, the world's current times and deeds, and their\r\nspirit, must be first profoundly estimated. Out of the hundred years\r\njust ending, (1776-1876,) with their genesis of inevitable wilful\r\nevents, and new experiments and introductions, and many unprecedented\r\nthings of war and peace, (to be realized better, perhaps only realized,\r\nat the remove of a century hence;) out of that stretch of time,\r\nand especially out of the immediately preceding twenty-five years,\r\n(1850-'75,) with all their rapid changes, innovations, and audacious\r\nmovements-and bearing their own inevitable wilful birth-marks--the\r\nexperiments of my poems too have found genesis.\r\n\r\nW. W.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n[33] PASSAGE TO INDIA.--As in some ancient legend-play, to close the\r\nplot and the hero's career, there is a farewell gathering on ship's deck\r\nand on shore, a loosing of hawsers and ties, a spreading of sails to\r\nthe wind--a starting out on unknown seas, to fetch up no one knows\r\nwhither--to return no more--and the curtain falls, and there is the end\r\nof it--so I have reserv'd that poem, with its cluster, to finish and\r\nexplain much that, without them, would not be explain'd, and to take\r\nleave, and escape for good, from all that has preceded them. (Then\r\nprobably \"Passage to India,\" and its cluster, are but freer vent and\r\nfuller expression to what, from the first, and so on throughout, more\r\nor less lurks in my writings, underneath every page, every line,\r\neverywhere.)\r\n\r\nI am not sure but the last inclosing sublimation of race or poem is,\r\nwhat it thinks of death. After the rest has been comprehended and said,\r\neven the grandest--after those contributions to mightiest nationality,\r\nor to sweetest song, or to the best personalism, male or female, have\r\nbeen glean'd from the rich and varied themes of tangible life, and\r\nhave been fully accepted and sung, and the pervading fact of visible\r\nexistence, with the duty it devolves, is rounded and apparently\r\ncompleted, it still remains to be really completed by suffusing through\r\nthe whole and several, that other pervading invisible fact, so large a\r\npart, (is it not the largest part?) of life here, combining the rest,\r\nand furnishing, for person or State, the only permanent and unitary\r\nmeaning to all, even the meanest life, consistently with the dignity of\r\nthe universe, in Time. As from the eligibility to this thought, and the\r\ncheerful conquest of this fact, flash forth the first distinctive\r\nproofs of the soul, so to me, (extending it only a little further,) the\r\nultimate Democratic purports, the ethereal and spiritual ones, are to\r\nconcentrate here, and as fixed stars, radiate hence. For, in my opinion,\r\nit is no less than this idea of immortality, above all other ideas,\r\nthat is to enter into, and vivify, and give crowning religious stamp, to\r\ndemocracy in the New World.\r\n\r\nIt was originally my intention, after chanting in \"Leaves of Grass\"\r\nthe songs of the body and existence, to then compose a further, equally\r\nneeded volume, based on those convictions of perpetuity and conservation\r\nwhich, enveloping all precedents, make the unseen soul govern absolutely\r\nat last. I meant, while in a sort continuing the theme of my first\r\nchants, to shift the slides, and exhibit the problem and paradox of the\r\nsame ardent and fully appointed personality entering the sphere of\r\nthe resistless gravitation of spiritual law, and with cheerful face\r\nestimating death, not at all as the cessation, but as somehow what\r\nI feel it must be, the entrance upon by far the greatest part of\r\nexistence, and something that life is at least as much for, as it is for\r\nitself. But the full construction of such a work is beyond my powers,\r\nand must remain for some bard in the future. The physical and the\r\nsensuous, in themselves or in their immediate continuations, retain\r\nholds upon me which I think are never entirely releas'd; and those holds\r\nI have not only not denied, but hardly wish'd to weaken.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, not entirely to give the go-by to my original plan, and far\r\nmore to avoid a mark'd hiatus in it, than to entirely fulfil it, I\r\nend my books with thoughts, or radiations from thoughts, on death,\r\nimmortality, and a free entrance into the spiritual world. In those\r\nthoughts, in a sort, I make the first steps or studies toward the mighty\r\ntheme, from the point of view necessitated by my foregoing poems, and\r\nby modern science. In them I also seek to set the key-stone to my\r\ndemocracy's enduring arch. I recollate them now, for the press, in\r\norder to partially occupy and offset days of strange sickness, and the\r\nheaviest affliction and bereavement of my life; and I fondly please\r\nmyself with the notion of leaving that cluster to you, O unknown reader\r\nof the future, as \"something to remember me by,\" more especially than\r\nall else. Written in former days of perfect health, little did I think\r\nthe pieces had the purport that now, under present circumstances, opens\r\nto me.\r\n\r\n[As I write these lines, May 31, 1875, it is again early summer,--again\r\nmy birth-day--now my fifty-sixth. Amid the outside beauty and freshness,\r\nthe sunlight and verdure of the delightful season, O how different the\r\nmoral atmosphere amid which I now revise this Volume, from the jocund\r\ninfluence surrounding the growth and advent of \"Leaves of Grass.\" I\r\noccupy myself, arranging these pages for publication, still envelopt\r\nin thoughts of the death two years since of my dear Mother, the most\r\nperfect and magnetic character, the rarest combination of practical,\r\nmoral and spiritual, and the least selfish, of all and any I have ever\r\nknown--and by me O so much the most deeply loved--and also under the\r\nphysical affliction of a tedious attack of paralysis, obstinately\r\nlingering and keeping its hold upon me, and quite suspending all bodily\r\nactivity and comfort.]\r\n\r\nUnder these influences, therefore, I still feel to keep \"Passage to\r\nIndia\" for last words even to this centennial dithyramb. Not as, in\r\nantiquity, at highest festival of Egypt, the noisome skeleton of death\r\nwas sent on exhibition to the revelers, for zest and shadow to the\r\noccasion's joy and light--but as the marble statue of the normal Greeks\r\nat Elis, suggesting death in the form of a beautiful and perfect young\r\nman, with closed eyes, leaning on an inverted torch--emblem of rest and\r\naspiration after action--of crown and point which all lives and poems\r\nshould steadily have reference to, namely, the justified and noble\r\ntermination of our identity, this grade of it, and outlet-preparation to\r\nanother grade.\r\n\r\n[34] Namely, a character, making most of common and normal elements, to\r\nthe superstructure of which not only the precious accumulations of the\r\nlearning and experiences of the Old World, and the settled social and\r\nmunicipal necessities and current requirements, so long a-building,\r\nshall still faithfully contribute, but which at its foundations and\r\ncarried up thence, and receiving its impetus from the democratic spirit,\r\nand accepting its gauge in all departments from the democratic formulas,\r\nshall again directly be vitalized by the perennial influences of Nature\r\nat first hand, and the old heroic stamina of Nature, the strong air\r\nof prairie and mountain, the dash of the briny sea, the primary\r\nantiseptics--of the passions, in all their fullest heat and potency,\r\nof courage, rankness, amativeness, and of immense pride. Not to lose at\r\nall, therefore, the benefits of artificial progress and civilization,\r\nbut to re-occupy for Western tenancy the oldest though ever-fresh\r\nfields, and reap from them the savage and sane nourishment indispensable\r\nto a hardy nation, and the absence of which, threatening to become worse\r\nand worse, is the most serious lack and defect to-day of our New World\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nNot but what the brawn of \"Leaves of Grass\" is, I hope, thoroughly\r\nspiritualized everywhere, for final estimate, but, from the very\r\nsubjects, the direct effect is a sense of the life, as it should be, of\r\nflesh and blood, and physical urge, and animalism. While there are other\r\nthemes, and plenty of abstract thoughts and poems in the volume--while\r\nI have put in it passing and rapid but actual glimpses of the great\r\nstruggle between the nation and the slave-power, (1861-'65,) as the\r\nfierce and bloody panorama of that contest unroll'd itself: while the\r\nwhole book, indeed, revolves around that four years' war, which, as I\r\nwas in the midst of it, becomes, in \"Drum-Taps,\" pivotal to the rest\r\nentire--and here and there, before and afterward, not a few episodes\r\nand speculations--_that_--namely, to make a type-portrait for living,\r\nactive, worldly, healthy personality, objective as well as subjective,\r\njoyful and potent, and modern and free, distinctively for the use of\r\nthe United States, male and female, through the long future--has been,\r\nI say, my general object. (Probably, indeed, the whole of these varied\r\nsongs, and all my writings, both volumes, only ring changes in some\r\nsort, on the ejaculation, How vast, how eligible, how joyful, how real,\r\nis a human being, himself or herself.)\r\n\r\nThough from no definite plan at the time, I see now that I have\r\nunconsciously sought, by indirections at least as much as directions, to\r\nexpress the whirls and rapid growth and intensity of the United States,\r\nthe prevailing tendency and events of the Nineteenth century, and\r\nlargely the spirit of the whole current world, my time; for I feel that\r\nI have partaken of that spirit, as I have been deeply interested in\r\nall those events, the closing of long-stretch'd eras and ages, and,\r\nillustrated in the history of the United States, the opening of larger\r\nones. (The death of President Lincoln, for instance, fitly, historically\r\ncloses, in the civilization of feudalism, many old influences--drops on\r\nthem, suddenly, a vast, gloomy, as it were, separating curtain.)\r\n\r\nSince I have been ill, (1873-'74-'75,) mostly without serious pain, and\r\nwith plenty of time and frequent inclination to judge my poems,\r\n(never composed with eye on the book-market, nor for fame, nor for any\r\npecuniary profit,) I have felt temporary depression more than once, for\r\nfear that in \"Leaves of Grass\" the _moral_ parts were not sufficiently\r\npronounced. But in my clearest and calmest moods I have realized that\r\nas those \"Leaves,\" all and several, surely prepare the way for, and\r\nnecessitate morals, and are adjusted to them, just the same as Nature\r\ndoes and is, they are what, consistently with my plan, they must and\r\nprobably should be. (In a certain sense, while the Moral is the purport\r\nand last intelligence of all Nature, there is absolutely nothing of\r\nthe moral in the works, or laws, or shows of Nature. Those only lead\r\ninevitably to it--begin and necessitate it.)\r\n\r\nThen I meant \"Leaves of Grass,\" as publish'd, to be the Poem of average\r\nIdentity, (of _yours_, whoever you are, now reading these lines.) A man\r\nis not greatest as victor in war, nor inventor or explorer, nor even\r\nin science, or in his intellectual or artistic capacity, or exemplar\r\nin some vast benevolence. To the highest democratic view, man is most\r\nacceptable in living well the practical life and lot which happens\r\nto him as ordinary farmer, sea-farer, mechanic, clerk, laborer, or\r\ndriver--upon and from which position as a central basis or pedestal,\r\nwhile performing its labors, and his duties as citizen, son, husband,\r\nfather and employ'd person, he preserves his physique, ascends,\r\ndeveloping, radiating himself in other regions--and especially where\r\nand when, (greatest of all, and nobler than the proudest mere genius or\r\nmagnate in any field,) he fully realizes the conscience, the spiritual,\r\nthe divine faculty, cultivated well, exemplified in all his deeds and\r\nwords, through life, uncompromising to the end--a flight loftier\r\nthan any of Homer's or Shakspere's--broader than all poems and\r\nbibles--namely, Nature's own, and in the midst of it, Yourself, your own\r\nIdentity, body and soul. (All serves, helps--but in the centre of all,\r\nabsorbing all, giving, for your purpose, the only meaning and vitality\r\nto all, master or mistress of all, under the law, stands Yourself.)\r\nTo sing the Song of that law of average Identity, and of Yourself,\r\nconsistently with the divine law of the universal, is a main intention\r\nof those \"Leaves.\"\r\n\r\nSomething more may be added--for, while I am about it, I would make a\r\nfull confession. I also sent out \"Leaves of Grass\" to arouse and set\r\nflowing in men's and women's hearts, young and old, endless streams of\r\nliving, pulsating love and friendship, directly from them to myself, now\r\nand ever. To this terrible, irrepressible yearning, (surely more or less\r\ndown underneath in most human souls)--this never-satisfied appetite\r\nfor sympathy, and this boundless offering of sympathy--this universal\r\ndemocratic comradeship-this old, eternal, yet ever-new interchange of\r\nadhesiveness, so fitly emblematic of America--I have given in that book,\r\nundisguisedly, declaredly, the openest expression. Besides, important\r\nas they are in my purpose as emotional expressions for humanity, the\r\nspecial meaning of the \"Calamus\" cluster of \"Leaves of Grass,\" (and\r\nmore or less running through the book, and cropping out in \"Drum-Taps,\")\r\nmainly resides in its political significance. In my opinion, it is by\r\na fervent, accepted development of comradeship, the beautiful and sane\r\naffection of man for man, latent in all the young fellows, north and\r\nsouth, east and west--it is by this, I say, and by what goes directly\r\nand indirectly along with it, that the United States of the future, (I\r\ncannot too often repeat,) are to be most effectually welded together,\r\nintercalated, anneal'd into a living union.\r\n\r\nThen, for enclosing clue of all, it is imperatively and ever to be\r\nborne in mind that \"Leaves of Grass\" entire is not to be construed as an\r\nintellectual or scholastic effort or poem mainly, but more as a radical\r\nutterance out of the Emotions and the Physique--an utterance adjusted\r\nto, perhaps born of, Democracy and the Modern--in its very nature\r\nregardless of the old conventions, and, under the great laws, following\r\nonly its own impulses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOETRY TO-DAY IN AMERICA\r\n\r\nSHAKSPERE--THE FUTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, the topmost proof of a race is its own born\r\npoetry. The presence of that, or the absence, each tells its story. As\r\nthe flowering rose or lily, as the ripened fruit to a tree, the apple or\r\nthe peach, no matter how fine the trunk, or copious or rich the branches\r\nand foliage, here waits _sine qua non_ at last. The stamp of entire and\r\nfinished greatness to any nation, to the American Republic among the\r\nrest, must be sternly withheld till it has put what it stands for in the\r\nblossom of original, first-class poems. No imitations will do.\r\n\r\nAnd though no _esthetik_ worthy the present condition or future\r\ncertainties of the New World seems to have been outlined in men's minds,\r\nor has been generally called for, or thought needed, I am clear that\r\nuntil the United States have just such definite and native expressers\r\nin the highest artistic fields, their mere political, geographical,\r\nwealth-forming, and even intellectual eminence, however astonishing\r\nand predominant, will constitute but a more and more expanded and\r\nwell-appointed body, and perhaps brain, with little or no soul.\r\nSugar-coat the grim truth as we may, and ward off with outward plausible\r\nwords, denials, explanations, to the mental inward perception of the\r\nland this blank is plain; a barren void exists. For the meanings and\r\nmaturer purposes of these States are not the constructing of a new world\r\nof politics merely, and physical comforts for the million, but even more\r\ndeterminedly, in range with science and the modern, of a new world of\r\ndemocratic sociology and imaginative literature. If the latter were not\r\nestablish'd for the States, to form their only permanent tie and hold,\r\nthe first-named would be of little avail.\r\n\r\nWith the poems of a first-class land are twined, as weft with warp, its\r\ntypes of personal character, of individuality, peculiar, native, its\r\nown physiognomy, man's and woman's, its own shapes, forms, and manners,\r\nfully justified under the eternal laws of all forms, all manners, all\r\ntimes. The hour has come for democracy in America to inaugurate\r\nitself in the two directions specified--autochthonic poems and\r\npersonalities--born expressers of itself, its spirit alone, to radiate\r\nin subtle ways, not only in art, but the practical and familiar, in the\r\ntransactions between employers and employed persons, in business and\r\nwages, and sternly in the army and navy, and revolutionizing them. I\r\nfind nowhere a scope profound enough, and radical and objective enough,\r\neither for aggregates or individuals. The thought and identity of\r\na poetry in America to fill, and worthily fill, the great void, and\r\nenhance these aims, electrifying all and several, involves the essence\r\nand integral facts, real and spiritual, of the whole land, the whole\r\nbody. What the great sympathetic is to the congeries of bones, joints,\r\nheart, fluids, nervous system and vitality, constituting, launching\r\nforth in time and space a human being--aye, an immortal soul--such\r\nrelation, and no less, holds true poetry to the single personality, or\r\nto the nation.\r\n\r\nHere our thirty-eight States stand to-day, the children of past\r\nprecedents, and, young as they are, heirs of a very old estate. One or\r\ntwo points we will consider, out of the myriads presenting themselves.\r\nThe feudalism, of the British Islands, illustrated by Shakspere--and by\r\nhis legitimate followers, Walter Scott and Alfred Tennyson--with all its\r\ntyrannies, superstitions, evils, had most superb and heroic permeating\r\nveins, poems, manners; even its errors fascinating. It almost seems as\r\nif only that feudalism in Europe, like slavery in our own South, could\r\noutcrop types of tallest, noblest personal character yet--strength and\r\ndevotion and love better than elsewhere--invincible courage, generosity,\r\naspiration, the spines of all. Here is where Shakspere and the others\r\nI have named perform a service incalculably precious to our America.\r\nPolitics, literature, and everything else, centers at last in perfect\r\n_personnel_, (as democracy is to find the same as the rest;) and here\r\nfeudalism is unrival'd--here the rich and highest-rising lessons it\r\nbequeaths us--a mass of foreign nutriment, which we are to work over,\r\nand popularize and enlarge, and present again in our own growths.\r\n\r\nStill there are pretty grave and anxious drawbacks, jeopardies, fears.\r\nLet us give some reflections on the subject, a little fluctuating, but\r\nstarting from one central thought, and returning there again. Two or\r\nthree curious results may plow up. As in the astronomical laws, the\r\nvery power that would seem most deadly and destructive turns out to be\r\nlatently conservative of longest, vastest future births and lives.\r\nWe will for once briefly examine the just-named authors solely from a\r\nWestern point of view. It may be, indeed, that we shall use the sun\r\nof English literature, and the brightest current stars of his system,\r\nmainly as pegs to hang some cogitations on, for home inspection.\r\n\r\nAs depicter and dramatist of the passions at their stormiest outstretch,\r\nthough ranking high, Shakspere (spanning the arch wide enough) is\r\nequaled by several, and excelled by the best old Greeks, (as Eschylus.)\r\nBut in portraying mediaeval European lords and barons, the arrogant\r\nport, so dear to the inmost human heart, (pride! pride! dearest,\r\nperhaps, of all--touching us, too, of the States closest of all--closer\r\nthan love,) he stands alone, and I do not wonder he so witches the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nFrom first to last, also, Walter Scott and Tennyson, like Shakspere,\r\nexhale that principle of caste which we Americans have come on earth to\r\ndestroy. Jefferson's verdict on the Waverley novels was that they turned\r\nand condensed brilliant but entirely false lights and glamours over the\r\nlords, ladies, and aristocratic institutes of Europe, with all\r\ntheir measureless infamies, and then left the bulk of the suffering,\r\ndown-trodden people contemptuously in the shade. Without stopping to\r\nanswer this hornet-stinging criticism, or to repay any part of the\r\ndebt of thanks I owe, in common with every American, to the noblest,\r\nhealthiest, cheeriest romancer that ever lived, I pass on to Tennyson,\r\nhis works.\r\n\r\nPoetry here of a very high (perhaps the highest) order of verbal\r\nmelody, exquisitely clean and pure, and almost always perfumed, like the\r\ntuberose, to an extreme of sweetness--sometimes not, however, but even\r\nthen a camellia of the hot-house, never a common flower--the verse\r\nof inside elegance and high-life; and yet preserving amid all its\r\nsuper-delicatesse a smack of outdoors and outdoor folk. The old Norman\r\nlordhood quality here, too, crossed with that Saxon fiber from which\r\ntwain the best current stock of England springs--poetry that revels\r\nabove all things in traditions of knights and chivalry, and deeds of\r\nderring-do. The odor of English social life in its highest range--a\r\nmelancholy, affectionate, very manly, but dainty breed--pervading\r\nthe pages like an invisible scent; the idleness, the traditions, the\r\nmannerisms, the stately _ennui_; the yearning of love, like a spinal\r\nmarrow, inside of all; the costumes brocade and satin; the old\r\nhouses and furniture--solid oak, no mere veneering--the moldy secrets\r\neverywhere; the verdure, the ivy on the walls, the moat, the English\r\nlandscape outside, the buzzing fly in the sun inside the window pane.\r\nNever one democratic page; nay, not a line, not a word; never free and\r\n_naïve_ poetry, but involved, labored, quite sophisticated--even when\r\nthe theme is ever so simple or rustic, (a shell, a bit of sedge, the\r\ncommonest love-passage between a lad and lass,) the handling of the\r\nrhyme all showing the scholar and conventional gentleman; showing the\r\nlaureate too, the _attaché_ of the throne, and most excellent, too;\r\nnothing better through the volumes than the dedication \"to the Queen\"\r\nat the beginning, and the other fine dedication, \"these to his memory\"\r\n(Prince Albert's,) preceding \"Idylls of the King.\"\r\n\r\nSuch for an off-hand summary of the mighty three that now, by the women,\r\nmen, and young folk of the fifty millions given these States by their\r\nlate census, have been and are more read than all others put together.\r\n\r\nWe hear it said, both of Tennyson and another current leading literary\r\nillustrator of Great Britain, Carlyle--as of Victor Hugo in France--that\r\nnot one of them is personally friendly or admirant toward America;\r\nindeed, quite the reverse. _N'importe_. That they (and more good minds\r\nthan theirs) cannot span the vast revolutionary arch thrown by the\r\nUnited States over the centuries, fixed in the present, launched to\r\nthe endless future; that they cannot stomach the high-life-below-stairs\r\ncoloring all our poetic and genteel social status so far--the\r\nmeasureless viciousness of the great radical Republic, with its\r\nruffianly nominations and elections; its loud, ill-pitched voice,\r\nutterly regardless whether the verb agrees with the nominative; its\r\nfights, errors, eructations, repulsions, dishonesties, audacities;\r\nthose fearful and varied and long-continued storm and stress stages (so\r\noffensive to the well-regulated college-bred mind) wherewith Nature,\r\nhistory, and time block out nationalities more powerful than the\r\npast, and to upturn it and press on to the future;--that they cannot\r\nunderstand and fathom all this, I say, is it to be wondered at?\r\nFortunately, the gestation of our thirty-eight empires (and plenty more\r\nto come) proceeds on its course, on scales of area and velocity immense\r\nand absolute as the globe, and, like the globe itself, quite oblivious\r\neven of great poets and thinkers. But we can by no means afford to be\r\noblivious of them.\r\n\r\nThe same of feudalism, its castles, courts, etiquettes, personalities.\r\nHowever they, or the spirits of them hovering in the air, might scowl\r\nand glower at such removes as current Kansas or Kentucky life and forms,\r\nthe latter may by no means repudiate or leave out the former. Allowing\r\nall the evil that it did, we get, here and today, a balance of good out\r\nof its reminiscence almost beyond price.\r\n\r\nAm I content, then, that the general interior chyle of our republic\r\nshould be supplied and nourish'd by wholesale from foreign and\r\nantagonistic sources such as these? Let me answer that question briefly:\r\n\r\nYears ago I thought Americans ought to strike out separate, and have\r\nexpressions of their own in highest literature. I think so still,\r\nand more decidedly than ever. But those convictions are now strongly\r\ntemper'd by some additional points, (perhaps the results of advancing\r\nage, or the reflection of invalidism.) I see that this world of the\r\nWest, as part of all, fuses inseparably with the East, and with all,\r\nas time does--the ever new yet old, old human race--\"the same subject\r\ncontinued,\" as the novels of our grandfathers had it for chapter-heads.\r\nIf we are not to hospitably receive and complete the inaugurations of\r\nthe old civilizations, and change their small scale to the largest,\r\nbroadest scale, what on earth are we for?\r\n\r\nThe currents of practical business in America, the rude, coarse,\r\ntussling facts of our lives, and all their daily experiences, need just\r\nthe precipitation and tincture of this entirely different fancy world\r\nof lulling, contrasting, even feudalistic, anti-republican poetry and\r\nromance. On the enormous outgrowth of our unloos'd individualities,\r\nand the rank, self-assertion of humanity here, may well fall these\r\ngrace-persuading, _recherché_ influences. We first require that\r\nindividuals and communities shall be free; then surely comes a time\r\nwhen it is requisite that they shall not be too free. Although to such\r\nresults in the future I look mainly for a great poetry native to us,\r\nthese importations till then will have to be accepted, such as they are,\r\nand thankful they are no worse. The inmost spiritual currents of the\r\npresent time curiously revenge and check their own compell'd tendency\r\nto democracy, and absorption in it, by mark'd leanings to the past--by\r\nreminiscences in poems, plots, operas, novels, to a far-off, contrary,\r\ndeceased world, as if they dreaded the great vulgar gulf-tides of\r\nto-day. Then what has been fifty centuries growing, working in, and\r\naccepted as crowns and apices for our kind, is not going to be pulled\r\ndown and discarded in a hurry.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, time we paid our respects directly to the honorable\r\nparty, the real object of these preambles. But we must make\r\n_reconnaissance_ a little further still. Not the least part of our\r\nlesson were to realize the curiosity and interest of friendly foreign\r\nexperts,[35] and how our situation looks to them. \"American poetry,\"\r\nsays the London \"Times,\"[36] is the poetry of apt pupils, but it is\r\nafflicted from first to last with a fatal want of raciness. Bryant has\r\nbeen long passed as a poet by Professor Longfellow; but in Longfellow,\r\nwith all his scholarly grace and tender feeling, the defect is more\r\napparent than it was in Bryant. Mr. Lowell can overflow with American\r\nhumor when politics inspire his muse; but in the realm of pure poetry he\r\nis no more American than a Newdigate prize-man. Joaquin Miller's verse\r\nhas fluency and movement and harmony, but as for the thought, his songs\r\nof the sierras might as well have been written in Holland.\r\n\r\nUnless in a certain very slight contingency, the \"Times\" says: \"American\r\nverse, from its earliest to its latest stages, seems an exotic, with an\r\nexuberance of gorgeous blossom, but no principle of reproduction. That\r\nis the very note and test of its inherent want. Great poets are tortured\r\nand massacred by having their flowers of fancy gathered and gummed down\r\nin the _hortus siccus_ of an anthology. American poets show better in\r\nan anthology than in the collected volumes of their works. Like their\r\naudience they have been unable to resist the attraction of the vast\r\norbit of English literature. They may talk of the primeval forest, but\r\nit would generally be very hard from internal evidence to detect that\r\nthey were writing on the banks of the Hudson rather than on those of the\r\nThames. ....In fact, they have caught the English tone and air and mood\r\nonly too faithfully, and are accepted by the superficially cultivated\r\nEnglish intelligence as readily as if they were English born. Americans\r\nthemselves confess to a certain disappointment that a literary curiosity\r\nand intelligence so diffused [as in the United States] have not taken\r\nup English literature at the point at which America has received it, and\r\ncarried it forward and developed it with an independent energy. But like\r\nreader like poet. Both show the effects of having come into an estate\r\nthey have not earned. A nation of readers has required of its poets a\r\ndiction and symmetry of form equal to that of an old literature like\r\nthat of Great Britain, which is also theirs. No ruggedness, however\r\nracy, would be tolerated by circles which, however superficial their\r\nculture, read Byron and Tennyson.\"\r\n\r\nThe English critic, though a gentleman and a scholar, and friendly\r\nwithal, is evidently not altogether satisfied, (perhaps he is jealous,)\r\nand winds up by saying: \"For the English language to have been enriched\r\nwith a national poetry which was not English but American, would have\r\nbeen a treasure beyond price.\" With which, as whet and foil, we shall\r\nproceed to ventilate more definitely certain no doubt willful opinions.\r\n\r\nLeaving unnoticed at present the great masterpieces of the antique, or\r\nanything from the middle ages, the prevailing flow of poetry for the\r\nlast fifty or eighty years, and now at its height, has been and is (like\r\nthe music) an expression of mere surface melody, within narrow limits,\r\nand yet, to give it its due, perfectly satisfying to the demands of the\r\near, of wondrous charm, of smooth and easy delivery, and the triumph of\r\ntechnical art. Above all things it is fractional and select. It shrinks\r\nwith aversion from the sturdy, the universal, and the democratic.\r\n\r\nThe poetry of the future, (a phrase open to sharp criticism, and not\r\nsatisfactory to me, but significant, and I will use it)--the poetry of\r\nthe future aims at the free expression of emotion, (which means far, far\r\nmore than appears at first,) and to arouse and initiate, more than to\r\ndefine or finish. Like all modern tendencies, it has direct or indirect\r\nreference continually to the reader, to you or me, to the central\r\nidentity of everything, the mighty Ego. (Byron's was a vehement dash,\r\nwith plenty of impatient democracy, but lurid and introverted amid all\r\nits magnetism; not at all the fitting, lasting song of a grand, secure,\r\nfree, sunny race.) It is more akin, likewise, to outside life and\r\nlandscape, (returning mainly to the antique feeling,) real sun and gale,\r\nand woods and shores--to the elements themselves--not sitting at ease in\r\nparlor or library listening to a good tale of them, told in good rhyme.\r\nCharacter, a feature far above style or polish--a feature not absent at\r\nany time, but now first brought to the fore--gives predominant stamp to\r\nadvancing poetry. Its born sister, music, already responds to the same\r\ninfluences. \"The music of the present, Wagner's, Gounod's, even the\r\nlater Verdi's, all tends toward this free expression of poetic emotion,\r\nand demands a vocalism totally unlike that required for Rossini's\r\nsplendid roulades, or Bellini's suave melodies.\"\r\n\r\nIs there not even now, indeed, an evolution, a departure from the\r\nmasters? Venerable and unsurpassable after their kind as are the old\r\nworks, and always unspeakably precious as studies, (for Americans\r\nmore than any other people,) is it too much to say that by the\r\nshifted combinations of the modern mind the whole underlying theory\r\nof first-class verse has changed? \"Formerly, during the period term'd\r\nclassic,\" says Sainte-Beuve, \"when literature was govern'd by recognized\r\nrules, he was considered the best poet who had composed the most perfect\r\nwork, the most beautiful poem, the most intelligible, the most\r\nagreeable to read, the most complete in every respect,--the Aeneid, the\r\nGerusalemme, a fine tragedy. To-day, something else is wanted. For us\r\nthe greatest poet is he who in his works most stimulates the reader's\r\nimagination and reflection, who excites him the most himself to poetize.\r\nThe greatest poet is not he who has done the best; it is he who suggests\r\nthe most; he, not all of whose meaning is at first obvious, and who\r\nleaves you much to desire, to explain, to study, much to complete in\r\nyour turn.\"\r\n\r\nThe fatal defects our American singers labor under are subordination of\r\nspirit, an absence of the concrete and of real patriotism, and in excess\r\nthat modern esthetic contagion a queer friend of mine calls the _beauty\r\ndisease_. \"The immoderate taste for beauty and art,\" says Charles\r\nBaudelaire, \"leads men into monstrous excesses. In minds imbued with a\r\nfrantic greed for the beautiful, all the balances of truth and justice\r\ndisappear. There is a lust, a disease of the art faculties, which eats\r\nup the moral like a cancer.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, by our plentiful verse-writers there is plenty of service\r\nperform'd, of a kind. Nor need we go far for a tally. We see, in\r\nevery polite circle, a class of accomplished, good-natured persons,\r\n(\"society,\" in fact, could not get on without them,) fully eligible for\r\ncertain problems, times, and duties--to mix egg-nog, to mend the broken\r\nspectacles, to decide whether the stewed eels shall precede the sherry\r\nor the sherry the stewed eels, to eke out Mrs. A. B.'s parlor-tableaux\r\nwith monk, Jew, lover, Puck, Prospero, Caliban, or what not, and to\r\ngenerally contribute and gracefully adapt their flexibilities and\r\ntalents, in those ranges, to the world's service. But for real crises,\r\ngreat needs and pulls, moral or physical, they might as well have never\r\nbeen born.\r\n\r\nOr the accepted notion of a poet would appear to be a sort of male\r\nodalisque, singing or piano-playing a kind of spiced ideas, second-hand\r\nreminiscences, or toying late hours at entertainments, in rooms stifling\r\nwith fashionable scent. I think I haven't seen a new-published, healthy,\r\nbracing, simple lyric in ten years. Not long ago, there were verses in\r\neach of three fresh monthlies, from leading authors, and in every one\r\nthe whole central _motif_ (perfectly serious) was the melancholiness\r\nof a marriageable young woman who didn't get a rich husband, but a poor\r\none!\r\n\r\nBesides its tonic and _al fresco_ physiology, relieving such as this,\r\nthe poetry of the future will take on character in a more important\r\nrespect. Science, having extirpated the old stock-fables and\r\nsuperstitions, is clearing a field for verse, for all the arts, and\r\neven for romance, a hundred-fold ampler and more wonderful, with the new\r\nprinciples behind. Republicanism advances over the whole world. Liberty,\r\nwith Law by her side, will one day be paramount--will at any rate be\r\nthe central idea. Then only--for all the splendor and beauty of what has\r\nbeen, or the polish of what is--then only will the true poets appear,\r\nand the true poems. Not the satin and patchouly of today, not the\r\nglorification of the butcheries and wars of the past, nor any fight\r\nbetween Deity on one side and somebody else on the other--not Milton,\r\nnot even Shakspere's plays, grand as they are. Entirely different and\r\nhitherto unknown Classes of men, being authoritatively called for in\r\nimaginative literature, will certainly appear. What is hitherto most\r\nlacking, perhaps most absolutely indicates the future. Democracy has\r\nbeen hurried on through time by measureless tides and winds, resistless\r\nas the revolution of the globe, and as far-reaching and rapid. But in\r\nthe highest walks of art it has not yet had a single representative\r\nworthy of it anywhere upon the earth.\r\n\r\nNever had real bard a task more fit for sublime ardor and genius than\r\nto sing worthily the songs these States have already indicated. Their\r\norigin, Washington, '76, the picturesqueness of old times, the war of\r\n1812 and the sea-fights; the incredible rapidity of movement and breadth\r\nof area--to fuse and compact the South and North, the East and West,\r\nto express the native forms, situations, scenes, from Montauk to\r\nCalifornia, and from the Saguenay to the Rio Grande--the working out on\r\nsuch gigantic scales, and with such a swift and mighty play of changing\r\nlight and shade, of the great problems of man and freedom,--how far\r\nahead of the stereotyped plots, or gem-cutting, or tales of love,\r\nor wars of mere ambition! Our history is so full of spinal, modern,\r\ngerminal subjects--one above all. What the ancient siege of Illium, and\r\nthe puissance of Hector's and Agamemnon's warriors proved to Hellenic\r\nart and literature, and all art and literature since, may prove the\r\nwar of attempted secession of 1861-'65 to the future esthetics, drama,\r\nromance, poems of the United States.\r\n\r\nNor could utility itself provide anything more practically serviceable\r\nto the hundred millions who, a couple of generations hence, will inhabit\r\nwithin the limits just named, than the permeation of a sane, sweet,\r\nautochthonous national poetry--must I say of a kind that does not now\r\nexist? but which, I fully believe, will in time be supplied on scales as\r\nfree as Nature's elements. (It is acknowledged that we of the States\r\nare the most materialistic and money-making people ever known. My own\r\ntheory, while fully accepting this, is that we are the most emotional,\r\nspiritualistic, and poetry-loving people also.)\r\n\r\nInfinite are the new and orbic traits waiting to be launch'd forth in\r\nthe firmament that is, and is to be, America. Lately, I have wonder'd\r\nwhether the last meaning of this cluster of thirty-eight States is not\r\nonly practical fraternity among themselves--the only real union, (much\r\nnearer its accomplishment, too, than appears on the surface)--but for\r\nfraternity over the whole globe--that dazzling, pensive dream of ages!\r\nIndeed, the peculiar glory of our lands, I have come to see, or expect\r\nto see, not in their geographical or republican greatness, nor wealth or\r\nproducts, nor military or naval power, nor special, eminent names in any\r\ndepartment, to shine with, or outshine, foreign special names in similar\r\ndepartments,--but more and more in a vaster, saner, more surrounding\r\nComradeship, uniting closer and closer not only the American States, but\r\nall nations, and all humanity. That, O poets! is not that a theme worth\r\nchanting, striving for? Why not fix your verses henceforth to the\r\ngauge of the round globe? the whole race? Perhaps the most illustrious\r\nculmination of the modern may thus prove to be a signal growth of\r\njoyous, more exalted bards of adhesiveness, identically one in soul, but\r\ncontributed by every nation, each after its distinctive kind. Let us,\r\naudacious, start it. Let the diplomats, as ever, still deeply plan,\r\nseeking advantages, proposing treaties between governments, and to bind\r\nthem, on paper: what I seek is different, simpler. I would inaugurate\r\nfrom America, for this purpose, new formulas--international poems. I\r\nhave thought that the invisible root out of which the poetry deepest in,\r\nand dearest to, humanity grows, is Friendship. I have thought that both\r\nin patriotism and song (even amid their grandest shows past) we have\r\nadhered too long to petty limits, and that the time has come to enfold\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nNot only is the human and artificial world we have establish'd in the\r\nWest a radical departure from anything hitherto known--not only men and\r\npolitics, and all that goes with them--but Nature itself, in the main\r\nsense, its construction, is different. The same old font of type, of\r\ncourse, but set up to a text never composed or issued before. For Nature\r\nconsists not only in itself, objectively, but at least just as much in\r\nits subjective reflection from the person, spirit, age, looking at\r\nit, in the midst of it, and absorbing it--faithfully sends back the\r\ncharacteristic beliefs of the time or individual--takes, and readily\r\ngives again, the physiognomy of any nation or literature--falls like a\r\ngreat elastic veil on a face, or like the molding plaster on a statue.\r\n\r\nWhat is Nature? What were the elements, the invisible backgrounds and\r\neidolons of it, to Homer's heroes, voyagers, gods? What all through the\r\nwanderings of Virgil's Aeneas? Then to Shakspere's characters--Hamlet,\r\nLear, the English-Norman kings, the Romans? What was Nature to Rousseau,\r\nto Voltaire, to the German Goethe in his little classical court gardens?\r\nIn those presentments in Tennyson (see the \"Idylls of the King\"--what\r\nsumptuous, perfumed, arras-and-gold Nature, inimitably described, better\r\nthan any, fit for princes and knights and peerless ladies--wrathful or\r\npeaceful, just the same--Vivien and Merlin in their strange dalliance,\r\nor the death-float of Elaine, or Geraint and the long journey of his\r\ndisgraced Enid and himself through the wood, and the wife all day\r\ndriving the horses,) as in all the great imported art-works, treatises\r\nsystems, from Lucretius down, there is a constantly lurking often\r\npervading something, that will have to be eliminated, as not only\r\nunsuited to modern democracy and science in America, but insulting to\r\nthem, and disproved by them.[37]\r\n\r\nStill, the rule and demesne of poetry will always be not the exterior,\r\nbut interior; not the macrocosm, but microcosm; not Nature, but Man. I\r\nhaven't said anything about the imperative need of a race of giant bards\r\nin the future, to hold up high to eyes of land and race the eternal\r\nantiseptic models, and to dauntlessly confront greed, injustice, and all\r\nforms of that wiliness and tyranny whose roots never die--(my opinion\r\nis, that after all the rest is advanced, _that_ is what first-class\r\npoets are for; as, to their days and occasions, the Hebrew lyrists,\r\nRoman Juvenal, and doubtless the old singers of India, and the British\r\nDruids)--to counteract dangers, immensest ones, already looming in\r\nAmerica--measureless corruption in politics--what we call religion,\r\na mere mask of wax or lace;--for _ensemble_, that most cankerous,\r\noffensive of all earth's shows--a vast and varied community, prosperous\r\nand fat with wealth of money and products and business ventures--plenty\r\nof mere intellectuality too--and then utterly without the sound,\r\nprevailing, moral and esthetic health-action beyond all the money and\r\nmere intellect of the world.\r\n\r\nIs it a dream of mine that, in times to come, west, south, east, north,\r\nwill silently, surely arise a race of such poets, varied, yet one\r\nin soul--nor only poets, and of the best, but newer, larger\r\nprophets--larger than Judea's, and more passionate--to meet and\r\npenetrate those woes, as shafts of light the darkness?\r\n\r\nAs I write, the last fifth of the nineteenth century is enter'd upon,\r\nand will soon be waning. Now, and for a long time to come, what the\r\nUnited States most need, to give purport, definiteness, reason why, to\r\ntheir unprecedented material wealth, industrial products, education\r\nby rote merely, great populousness and intellectual activity, is the\r\ncentral, spinal reality, (or even the idea of it,) of such a democratic\r\nband of-native-born-and-bred teachers, artists, _littérateurs_, tolerant\r\nand receptive of importations, but entirely adjusted to the West, to\r\nourselves, to our own days, combinations, differences, superiorities.\r\nIndeed, I am fond of thinking that the whole series of concrete and\r\npolitical triumphs of the Republic are mainly as bases and preparations\r\nfor half a dozen future poets, ideal personalities, referring not to a\r\nspecial class, but to the entire people, four or five millions of square\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nLong, long are the processes of the development of a nationality Only\r\nto the rapt vision does the seen become the prophecy of the unseen.[38]\r\nDemocracy, so far attending only to the real, is not for the real only,\r\nbut the grandest ideal--to justify the modern by that, and not only to\r\nequal, but to become by that superior to the past.\r\n\r\nOn a comprehensive summing up of the processes and present and hitherto\r\ncondition of the United States, with reference to their future, and\r\nthe indispensable precedents to it, my point, below all surfaces, and\r\nsubsoiling them, is, that the bases and prerequisites of a leading\r\nnationality are, first, at all hazards, freedom, worldly wealth and\r\nproducts on the largest and most varied scale, common education and\r\nintercommunication, and, in general, the passing through of just the\r\nstages and crudities we have passed or are passing through in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThen, perhaps, as weightiest factor of the whole business, and of the\r\nmain outgrowths of the future, it remains to be definitely avow'd\r\nthat the native-born middle-class population of quite all the United\r\nStates--the average of farmers and mechanics everywhere--the real,\r\nthough latent and silent bulk of America, city or country, presents a\r\nmagnificent mass of material, never before equal'd on earth. It is this\r\nmaterial, quite unexpress'd by literature or art, that in every respect\r\ninsures the future of the republic. During the secession war I was with\r\nthe armies, and saw the rank and file, north and south, and studied them\r\nfor four years. I have never had the least doubt about the country in\r\nits essential future since.\r\n\r\nMeantime, we can (perhaps) do no better than to saturate ourselves with,\r\nand continue to give imitations, yet awhile, of the esthetic models,\r\nsupplies, of that past and of those lands we spring from. Those wondrous\r\nstores, reminiscences, floods, currents! Let them flow on, flow hither\r\nfreely. And let the sources be enlarged, to include not only the works\r\nof British origin, as now, but stately and devout Spain, courteous\r\nFrance, profound Germany, the manly Scandinavian lands, Italy's art\r\nrace, and always the mystic Orient. Remembering that at present, and\r\ndoubtless long ahead, a certain humility would well become us. The\r\ncourse through time of highest civilization, does it not wait the\r\nfirst glimpse of our contribution to its kosmic train of poems,\r\nbibles, first-class structures, perpetuities--Egypt and Palestine and\r\nIndia--Greece and Rome and mediaeval Europe--and so onward? The shadowy\r\nprocession is not a meagre one, and the standard not a low one. All that\r\nis mighty in our kind seems to have already trod the road. Ah, never may\r\nAmerica forget her thanks and reverence for samples, treasures such\r\nas these--that other life-blood, inspiration, sunshine, hourly in use\r\nto-day, all days, forever, through her broad demesne!\r\n\r\nAll serves our New World progress, even the bafflers, head-winds,\r\ncross-tides. Through many perturbations and squalls, and much backing\r\nand filling, the ship, upon the whole, makes unmistakably for her\r\ndestination. Shakspere has served, and serves, may-be, the best of any.\r\n\r\nFor conclusion, a passing thought, a contrast, of him who, in my\r\nopinion, continues and stands for the Shaksperean cultus at the present\r\nday among all English-writing peoples--of Tennyson, his poetry. I find\r\nit impossible, as I taste the sweetness of those lines, to escape the\r\nflavor, the conviction, the lush-ripening culmination, and last honey of\r\ndecay (I dare not call it rottenness) of that feudalism which the\r\nmighty English dramatist painted in all the splendors of its noon and\r\nafternoon. And how they are chanted--both poets! Happy those kings and\r\nnobles to be so sung, so told! To run their course--to get their deeds\r\nand shapes in lasting pigments--the very pomp and dazzle of the sunset!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, democracy waits the coming of its bards in silence and in\r\ntwilight--but 'tis the twilight of the dawn.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n[35] A few years ago I saw the question, \"Has America produced any great\r\npoem?\" announced as prize-subject for the competition of some university\r\nin Northern Europe. I saw the item in a foreign paper and made a note\r\nof it; but being taken down with paralysis, and prostrated for a long\r\nseason, the matter slipp'd away, and I have never been able since to get\r\nhold of any essay presented for the prize, or report of the discussion,\r\nnor to learn for certain whether there was any essay or discussion,\r\nnor can I now remember the place. It may have been Upsala, or possibly\r\nHeidelberg. Perhaps some German or Scandinavian can give particulars. I\r\nthink it was in 1872.\r\n\r\n[36] In a long and prominent editorial, at the time, on the death of\r\nWilliam Cullen Bryant.\r\n\r\n[37] Whatever may be said of the few principal poems--or their best\r\npassages--it is certain that the overwhelming mass of poetic works,\r\nas now absorb'd into human character, exerts a certain constipating,\r\nrepressing, indoor, and artificial influence, impossible to\r\nelude--seldom or never that freeing, dilating, joyous one, with which\r\nuncramp'd Nature works on every individual without exception.\r\n\r\n[38] Is there not such a thing as the philosophy of American history and\r\npolitics? And if so, what is it?... Wise men say there are two sets\r\nof wills to nations and to persons--one set that acts and works\r\nfrom explainable motives--from teaching, intelligence, judgment,\r\ncircumstance, caprice, emulation, greed, etc.--and then another set,\r\nperhaps deep, hidden, unsuspected, yet often more potent than the\r\nfirst, refusing to be argued with, rising as it were out of abysses,\r\nresistlessly urging on speakers, doers, communities, unwitting to\r\nthemselves--the poet to his fieriest words--the race to pursue its\r\nloftiest ideal. Indeed, the paradox of a nation's life and career, with\r\nall its wondrous contradictions, can probably only be explain'd from\r\nthese two wills, sometimes conflicting, each operating in its sphere,\r\ncombining in races or in persons, and producing strangest results.\r\n\r\nLet us hope there is (indeed, can there be any doubt there is?) this\r\ngreat unconscious and abysmic second will also running through the\r\naverage nationality and career of America. Let us hope that, amid all\r\nthe dangers and defections of the present, and through all the processes\r\nof the conscious will, it alone is the permanent and sovereign force,\r\ndestined to carry on the New World to fulfil its destinies in the\r\nfuture--to resolutely pursue those destinies, age upon age; to build,\r\nfar, far beyond its past vision, present thought; to form and fashion,\r\nand for the general type, men and women more noble, more athletic than\r\nthe world has yet seen; to gradually, firmly blend, from all the States,\r\nwith all varieties, a friendly, happy, free, religious nationality--a\r\nnationality not only the richest, most inventive, most productive and\r\nmaterialistic the world has yet known, but compacted indissolubly, and\r\nout of whose ample and solid bulk, and giving purpose and finish to it,\r\nconscience, morals, and all the spiritual attributes, shall surely rise,\r\nlike spires above some group of edifices, firm-footed on the earth, yet\r\nscaling space and heaven.\r\n\r\nGreat as they are, and greater far to be, the United States, too, are\r\nbut a series of steps in the eternal process of creative thought. And\r\nhere is, to my mind, their final justification, and certain perpetuity.\r\nThere is in that sublime process, in the laws of the universe--and,\r\nabove all, in the moral law--something that would make unsatisfactory,\r\nand even vain and contemptible, all the triumphs of war, the gains of\r\npeace, and the proudest worldly grandeur of all the nations that\r\nhave ever existed, or that (ours included) now exist, except that we\r\nconstantly see, through all their worldly career, however struggling and\r\nblind and lame, attempts, by all ages, all peoples, according to their\r\ndevelopment, to reach, to press, to progress on, and ever farther on, to\r\nmore and more advanced ideals.\r\n\r\nThe glory of the republic of the United States, in my opinion, is to be\r\nthat, emerging in the light of the modern and the splendor of science,\r\nand solidly based on the past, it is to cheerfully range itself, and its\r\npolitics are henceforth to come, under those universal laws, and embody\r\nthem, and carry them out, to serve them. And as only that individual\r\nbecomes truly great who understands well that, while complete in himself\r\nin a certain sense, he is but a part of the divine, eternal scheme, and\r\nwhose special life and laws are adjusted to move in harmonious relations\r\nwith the general laws of Nature, and especially with the moral law, the\r\ndeepest and highest of all, and the last vitality of man or state--so\r\nthe United States may only become the greatest and the most continuous,\r\nby understanding well their harmonious relations with entire humanity\r\nand history, and all their laws and progress, sublimed with the creative\r\nthought of Deity, through all time, past, present, and future. Thus will\r\nthey expand to the amplitude of their destiny, and become illustrations\r\nand culminating parts of the kosmos, and of civilization.\r\n\r\nNo more considering the States as an incident, or series of incidents,\r\nhowever vast, coming accidentally along the path of time, and shaped\r\nby casual emergencies as they happen to arise, and the mere result of\r\nmodern improvements, vulgar and lucky, ahead of other nations and times,\r\nI would finally plant, as seeds, these thoughts or speculations in the\r\ngrowth of our republic--that it is the deliberate culmination and result\r\nof all the past--that here, too, as in all departments of the universe,\r\nregular laws (slow and sure in planting, slow and sure in ripening) have\r\ncontroll'd and govern'd, and will yet control and govern; and that those\r\nlaws can no more be baffled or steer'd clear of, or vitiated, by chance,\r\nor any fortune or opposition, than the laws of winter and summer, or\r\ndarkness and light.\r\n\r\nThe summing up of the tremendous moral and military perturbations of\r\n1861-'65, and their results--and indeed of the entire hundred years of\r\nthe past of our national experiment, from its inchoate movement down\r\nto the present day (1780-1881)--is, that they all now launch the United\r\nStates fairly forth, consistently with the entirety of civilization and\r\nhumanity, and in main sort the representative of them, leading the van,\r\nleading the fleet of the modern and democratic, on the seas and voyages\r\nof the future.\r\n\r\nAnd the real history of the United States--starting from that great\r\nconvulsive struggle for unity, the secession war, triumphantly\r\nconcluded, and _the South_ victorious after all--is only to be written\r\nat the remove of hundreds, perhaps a thousand, years hence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MEMORANDUM AT A VENTURE\r\n\r\n\r\n\"All is proper to be express'd, provided our aim is only high\r\nenough.\"--_J. F. Millet._\r\n\r\n\"The candor of science is the glory of the modern. It does not hide\r\nand repress; it confronts, turns on the light. It alone has perfect\r\nfaith--faith not in a part only, but all. Does it not undermine the old\r\nreligious standards? Yes, in God's truth, by excluding the devil from\r\nthe theory of the universe--by showing that evil is not a law in itself,\r\nbut a sickness, a perversion of the good, and the other side of the\r\ngood--that in fact all of humanity, and of everything, is divine in its\r\nbases, its eligibilities.\"\r\n\r\nShall the mention of such topics as I have briefly but plainly and\r\nresolutely broach'd in the \"Children of Adam\" section of \"Leaves of\r\nGrass\" be admitted in poetry and literature? Ought not the innovation\r\nto be put down by opinion and criticism? and, if those fail, by the\r\nDistrict Attorney? True, I could not construct a poem which declaredly\r\ntook, as never before, the complete human identity, physical, moral,\r\nemotional, and intellectual, (giving precedence and compass in a certain\r\nsense to the first,) nor fulfil that _bona fide_ candor and entirety\r\nof treatment which was a part of my purpose, without comprehending this\r\nsection also. But I would entrench myself more deeply and widely than\r\nthat. And while I do not ask any man to indorse my theory, I confess\r\nmyself anxious that what I sought to write and express, and the ground I\r\nbuilt on, shall be at least partially understood, from its own platform.\r\nThe best way seems to me to confront the question with entire frankness.\r\n\r\nThere are, generally speaking, two points of view, two conditions of the\r\nworld's attitude toward these matters; the first, the conventional one\r\nof good folks and good print everywhere, repressing any direct statement\r\nof them, and making allusions only at second or third hand--(as\r\nthe Greeks did of death, which, in Hellenic social culture, was not\r\nmention'd point-blank, but by euphemisms.) In the civilization of\r\nto-day, this condition--without stopping to elaborate the arguments and\r\nfacts, which are many and varied and perplexing--has led to states of\r\nignorance, repressal, and cover'd over disease and depletion,\r\nforming certainly a main factor in the world's woe. A nonscientific,\r\nnon-esthetic, and eminently non-religious condition, bequeath'd to us\r\nfrom the past, (its origins diverse, one of them the far-back lessons\r\nof benevolent and wise men to restrain the prevalent coarseness and\r\nanimality of the tribal ages--with Puritanism, or perhaps Protestantism\r\nitself for another, and still another specified in the latter part\r\nof this memorandum)--to it is probably due most of the ill births,\r\ninefficient maturity, snickering pruriency, and of that human pathologic\r\nevil and morbidity which is, in my opinion, the keel and reason-why of\r\nevery evil and morbidity. Its scent, as of something sneaking,\r\nfurtive, mephitic, seems to lingeringly pervade all modern literature,\r\nconversation, and manners.\r\n\r\nThe second point of view, and by far the largest--as the world in\r\nworking-day dress vastly exceeds the world in parlor toilette--is\r\nthe one of common life, from the oldest times down, and especially in\r\nEngland, (see the earlier chapters of \"Taine's English Literature,\" and\r\nsee Shakspere almost anywhere,) and which our age to-day inherits from\r\nriant stock, in the wit, or what passes for wit, of masculine circles,\r\nand in erotic stories and talk, to excite, express, and dwell on, that\r\nmerely sensual voluptuousness which, according to Victor Hugo, is the\r\nmost universal trait of all ages, all lands. This second condition,\r\nhowever bad, is at any rate like a disease which comes to the surface,\r\nand therefore less dangerous than a conceal'd one.\r\n\r\nThe time seems to me to have arrived, and America to be the place, for\r\na new departure--a third point of view. The same freedom and faith and\r\nearnestness which, after centuries of denial, struggle, repression,\r\nand martyrdom, the present day brings to the treatment of politics and\r\nreligion, must work out a plan and standard on this subject, not so\r\nmuch for what is call'd society, as for thoughtfulest men and women, and\r\nthoughtfulest literature. The same spirit that marks the physiological\r\nauthor and demonstrator on these topics in his important field, I have\r\nthought necessary to be exemplified, for once, in another certainly not\r\nless important field.\r\n\r\nIn the present memorandum I only venture to indicate that plan and\r\nview--decided upon more than twenty years ago, for my own literary\r\naction, and formulated tangibly in my printed poems--(as Bacon says an\r\nabstract thought or theory is of no moment unless it leads to a deed or\r\nwork done, exemplifying it in the concrete)--that the sexual passion\r\nin itself, while normal and unperverted, is inherently legitimate,\r\ncreditable, not necessarily an improper theme for poet, as confessedly\r\nnot for scientist--that, with reference to the whole construction,\r\norganism, and intentions of \"Leaves of Grass,\" anything short of\r\nconfronting that theme, and making myself clear upon it as the enclosing\r\nbasis of everything, (as the sanity of everything was to be the\r\natmosphere of the poems,) I should beg the question in its most\r\nmomentous aspect, and the superstructure that follow'd, pretensive as\r\nit might assume to be, would all rest on a poor foundation, or no\r\nfoundation at all. In short, as the assumption of the sanity of birth,\r\nNature and humanity, is the key to any true theory of life and the\r\nuniverse--at any rate, the only theory out of which I wrote--it is, and\r\nmust inevitably be, the only key to \"Leaves of Grass,\" and every part\r\nof it. _That_, (and not a vain consistency or weak pride, as a late\r\n\"Springfield Republican\" charges,) is the reason that I have stood out\r\nfor these particular verses uncompromisingly for over twenty years, and\r\nmaintain them to this day. _That_ is what I felt in my inmost brain and\r\nheart, when I only answer'd Emerson's vehement arguments with silence,\r\nunder the old elms of Boston Common.\r\n\r\nIndeed, might not every physiologist and every good physician pray\r\nfor the redeeming of this subject from its hitherto relegation to the\r\ntongues and pens of blackguards, and boldly putting it for once at\r\nleast, if no more, in the demesne of poetry and sanity--as something not\r\nin itself gross or impure, but entirely consistent with highest manhood\r\nand womanhood, and indispensable to both? Might not only every wife and\r\nevery mother--not only every babe that comes into the world, if that\r\nwere possible--not only all marriage, the foundation and _sine qua\r\nnon_ of the civilized state--bless and thank the showing, or taking for\r\ngranted, that motherhood, fatherhood, sexuality, and all that belongs\r\nto them, can be asserted, where it comes to question, openly, joyously,\r\nproudly, \"without shame or the need of shame,\" from the highest artistic\r\nand human considerations--but, with reverence be it written, on such\r\nattempt to justify the base and start of the whole divine scheme in\r\nhumanity, might not the Creative Power itself deign a smile of approval?\r\n\r\nTo the movement for the eligibility and entrance of women amid new\r\nspheres of business, politics, and the suffrage, the current prurient,\r\nconventional treatment of sex is the main formidable obstacle. The\r\nrising tide of \"woman's rights,\" swelling and every year advancing\r\nfarther and farther, recoils from it with dismay. There will in my\r\nopinion be no general progress in such eligibility till a sensible,\r\nphilosophic, democratic method is substituted.\r\n\r\nThe whole question--which strikes far, very far deeper than most people\r\nhave supposed, (and doubtless, too, something is to be said on all\r\nsides,) is peculiarly an important one in art--is first an ethic, and\r\nthen still more an esthetic one. I condense from a paper read not long\r\nsince at Cheltenham, England, before the \"Social Science Congress,\" to\r\nthe Art Department, by P. H. Rathbone of Liverpool, on the \"Undraped\r\nFigure in Art,\" and the discussion that follow'd:\r\n\r\n\"When coward Europe suffer'd the unclean Turk to soil the sacred shores\r\nof Greece by his polluting presence, civilization and morality receiv'd\r\na blow from which they have never entirely recover'd, and the trail of\r\nthe serpent has been over European art and European society ever since.\r\nThe Turk regarded and regards women as animals without soul, toys to be\r\nplay'd with or broken at pleasure, and to be hidden, partly from shame,\r\nbut chiefly for the purpose of stimulating exhausted passion. Such is\r\nthe unholy origin of the objection to the nude as a fit subject for art;\r\nit is purely Asiatic, and though not introduced for the first time\r\nin the fifteenth century, is yet to be traced to the source of all\r\nimpurity--the East. Although the source of the prejudice is thoroughly\r\nunhealthy and impure, yet it is now shared by many pure-minded and\r\nhonest, if somewhat uneducated, people. But I am prepared to maintain\r\nthat it is necessary for the future of English art and of English\r\nmorality that the right of the nude to a place in our galleries should\r\nbe boldly asserted; it must, however, be the nude as represented by\r\nthoroughly trained artists, and with a pure and noble ethic purpose. The\r\nhuman form, male and female, is the type and standard of all beauty of\r\nform and proportion, and it is necessary to be thoroughly familiar with\r\nit in order safely to judge of all beauty which consists of form and\r\nproportion. To women it is most necessary that they should become\r\nthoroughly imbued with the knowledge of the ideal female form, in order\r\nthat they should recognize the perfection of it at once, and without\r\neffort, and so far as possible avoid deviations from the ideal. Had\r\nthis been the case in times past, we should not have had to deplore the\r\ndistortions effected by tight-lacing, which destroy'd the figure and\r\nruin'd the health of so many of the last generation. Nor should we have\r\nhad the scandalous dresses alike of society and the stage. The extreme\r\ndevelopment of the low dresses which obtain'd some years ago, when the\r\nstays crush'd up the breasts into suggestive prominence, would surely\r\nhave been check'd, had the eye of the public been properly educated by\r\nfamiliarity with the exquisite beauty of line of a well-shaped bust.\r\nI might show how thorough acquaintance with the ideal nude foot would\r\nprobably have much modified the foot-torturing boots and high heels,\r\nwhich wring the foot out of all beauty of line, and throw the body\r\nforward into an awkward and ungainly attitude.\r\n\r\nIt is argued that the effect of nude representation of women upon young\r\nmen is unwholesome, but it would not be so if such works were admitted\r\nwithout question into our galleries, and became thoroughly familiar\r\nto them. On the contrary, it would do much to clear away from\r\nhealthy-hearted lads one of their sorest trials--that prurient curiosity\r\nwhich is bred of prudish concealment. Where there is mystery there is\r\nthe suggestion of evil, and to go to a theatre, where you have only to\r\nlook at the stalls to see one-half of the female form, and to the\r\nstage to see the other half undraped, is far more pregnant with evil\r\nimaginings than the most objectionable of totally undraped figures. In\r\nFrench art there have been questionable nude figures exhibited; but the\r\nfault was not that they were nude, but that they were the portraits\r\nof ugly immodest women. Some discussion follow'd. There was a general\r\nconcurrence in the principle contended for by the reader of the paper.\r\nSir Walter Stirling maintain'd that the perfect male figure, rather than\r\nthe female, was the model of beauty. After a few remarks from Rev. Mr.\r\nRoberts and Colonel Oldfield, the Chairman regretted that no opponent of\r\nnude figures had taken part in the discussion. He agreed with Sir\r\nWalter Stirling as to the male figure being the most perfect model of\r\nproportion. He join'd in defending the exhibition of nude figures,\r\nbut thought considerable supervision should be exercis'd over such\r\nexhibitions.\r\n\r\nNo, it is not the picture or nude statue or text, with clear aim, that\r\nis indecent; it is the beholder's own thought, inference, distorted\r\nconstruction. True modesty is one of the most precious of attributes,\r\neven virtues, but in nothing is there more pretense, more falsity, than\r\nthe needless assumption of it. Through precept and consciousness, man\r\nhas long enough realized how bad he is. I would not so much disturb or\r\ndemolish that conviction, only to resume and keep unerringly with it the\r\nspinal meaning of the Scriptural text, _God overlook'd all that He had\r\nmade_, (including the apex of the whole--humanity--with its elements,\r\npassions, appetites,) _and behold, it was very good_.\"\r\n\r\nDoes not anything short of that third point of view, when you come to\r\nthink of it profoundly and with amplitude, impugn Creation from the\r\noutset? In fact, however overlaid, or unaware of itself, does not\r\nthe conviction involv'd in it perennially exist at the centre of\r\nall society, and of the sexes, and of marriage? Is it not really an\r\nintuition of the human race? For, old as the world is, and beyond\r\nstatement as are the countless and splendid results of its culture and\r\nevolution, perhaps the best and earliest and purest intuitions of the\r\nhuman race have yet to be develop'd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN LECTURE\r\n\r\n_deliver'd in New York, April 14, 1879--in Philadelphia, '80--in Boston,\r\n'81_\r\n\r\n\r\nHow often since that dark and dripping Saturday--that chilly April day,\r\nnow fifteen years bygone--my heart has entertain'd the dream, the\r\nwish, to give of Abraham Lincoln's death, its own special thought and\r\nmemorial. Yet now the sought-for opportunity offers, I find my notes\r\nincompetent, (why, for truly profound themes, is statement so idle? why\r\ndoes the right phrase never offer?) and the fit tribute I dream'd of,\r\nwaits unprepared as ever. My talk here indeed is less because of itself\r\nor anything in it, and nearly altogether because I feel a desire, apart\r\nfrom any talk, to specify the day, the martyrdom. It is for this, my\r\nfriends, I have call'd you together. Oft as the rolling years bring\r\nback this hour, let it again, however briefly, be dwelt upon. For my\r\nown part, I hope and desire, till my own dying day, whenever the 14th\r\nor 15th of April comes, to annually gather a few friends, and hold its\r\ntragic reminiscence. No narrow or sectional reminiscence. It belongs\r\nto these States in their entirety--not the North only, but the\r\nSouth--perhaps belongs most tenderly and devoutly to the South, of\r\nall; for there, really, this man's birth-stock. There and thence\r\nhis antecedent stamp. Why should I not say that thence his manliest\r\ntraits--his universality--his canny, easy ways and words upon the\r\nsurface--his inflexible determination and courage at heart? Have you\r\nnever realized it, my friends, that Lincoln, though grafted on the West,\r\nis essentially, in personnel and character, a Southern contribution?\r\n\r\nAnd though by no means proposing to resume the secession war to-night,\r\nI would briefly remind you of the public conditions preceding that\r\ncontest. For twenty years, and especially during the four or five before\r\nthe war actually began, the aspect of affairs in the United States,\r\nthough without the flash of military excitement, presents more than\r\nthe survey of a battle, or any extended campaign, or series, even of\r\nNature's convulsions. The hot passions of the South--the strange\r\nmixture at the North of inertia, incredulity, and conscious power--the\r\nincendiarism of the abolitionists--the rascality and grip of the\r\npoliticians, unparallel'd in any land, any age. To these I must not omit\r\nadding the honesty of the essential bulk of the people everywhere--yet\r\nwith all the seething fury and contradiction of their natures more\r\narous'd than the Atlantic's waves in wildest equinox. In politics, what\r\ncan be more ominous, (though generally unappreciated then)--what more\r\nsignificant than the Presidentiads of Fillmore and Buchanan? proving\r\nconclusively that the weakness and wickedness of elected rulers are\r\njust as likely to afflict us here, as in the countries of the Old World,\r\nunder their monarchies, emperors, and aristocracies. In that Old World\r\nwere everywhere heard underground rumblings, that died out, only to\r\nagain surely return. While in America the volcano, though civic yet,\r\ncontinued to grow more and more convulsive--more and more stormy and\r\nthreatening.\r\n\r\nIn the height of all this excitement and chaos, hovering on the edge at\r\nfirst, and then merged in its very midst, and destined to play a leading\r\npart, appears a strange and awkward figure. I shall not easily forget\r\nthe first time I ever saw Abraham Lincoln. It must have been about the\r\n18th or 19th of February, 1861. It was rather a pleasant afternoon, in\r\nNew York city, as he arrived there from the West, to remain a few hours,\r\nand then pass on to Washington, to prepare for his inauguration. I saw\r\nhim in Broadway, near the site of the present Post-office. He came down,\r\nI think from Canal street, to stop at the Astor House. The broad spaces,\r\nsidewalks, and street in the neighborhood, and for some distance, were\r\ncrowded with solid masses of people, many thousands. The omnibuses and\r\nother vehicles had all been turn'd off, leaving an unusual hush in that\r\nbusy part of the city. Presently two or three shabby hack barouches made\r\ntheir way with some difficulty through the crowd, and drew up at the\r\nAstor House entrance. A tall figure stepp'd out of the centre of these\r\nbarouches, paus'd leisurely on the sidewalk, look'd up at the granite\r\nwalls and looming architecture of the grand old hotel--then, after a\r\nrelieving stretch of arms and legs, turn'd round for over a minute to\r\nslowly and good-humoredly scan the appearance of the vast and silent\r\ncrowds. There were no speeches--no compliments--no welcome--as far as\r\nI could hear, not a word said. Still much anxiety was conceal'd in that\r\nquiet. Cautious persons had fear'd some mark'd insult or indignity to\r\nthe President-elect--for he possess'd no personal popularity at all in\r\nNew York city, and very little political. But it was evidently tacitly\r\nagreed that if the few political supporters of Mr. Lincoln present\r\nwould entirely abstain from any demonstration on their side, the immense\r\nmajority, who were anything but supporters, would abstain on their side\r\nalso. The result was a sulky, unbroken silence, such as certainly never\r\nbefore characterized so great a New York crowd.\r\n\r\nAlmost in the same neighborhood I distinctly remember'd seeing Lafayette\r\non his visit to America in 1825. I had also personally seen and heard,\r\nvarious years afterward, how Andrew Jackson, Clay, Webster, Hungarian\r\nKossuth, Filibuster Walker, the Prince of Wales on his visit, and\r\nother celebres, native and foreign, had been welcom'd there--all that\r\nindescribable human roar and magnetism, unlike any other sound in the\r\nuniverse--the glad exulting thunder-shouts of countless unloos'd throats\r\nof men! But on this occasion, not a voice--not a sound. From the top of\r\nan omnibus, (driven up one side, close by, and block'd by the curbstone\r\nand the crowds,) I had, I say, a capital view of it all, and\r\nespecially of Mr. Lincoln, his look and gait--his perfect composure and\r\ncoolness--his unusual and uncouth height, his dress of complete black,\r\nstovepipe hat push'd back on the head, dark-brown complexion, seam'd\r\nand wrinkled yet canny-looking face, black, bushy head of hair,\r\ndisproportionately long neck, and his hands held behind as he stood\r\nobserving the people. He look'd with curiosity upon that immense sea of\r\nfaces, and the sea of faces return'd the look with similar curiosity. In\r\nboth there was a dash of comedy, almost farce, such as Shakspere puts in\r\nhis blackest tragedies. The crowd that hemm'd around consisted I should\r\nthink of thirty to forty thousand men, not a single one his personal\r\nfriend--while I have no doubt, (so frenzied were the ferments of\r\nthe time,) many an assassin's knife and pistol lurk'd in hip or\r\nbreast-pocket there, ready, soon as break and riot came.\r\n\r\nBut no break or riot came. The tall figure gave another relieving\r\nstretch or two of arms and legs; then with moderate pace, and\r\naccompanied by a few unknown-looking persons, ascended the portico-steps\r\nof the Astor House, disappear'd through its broad entrance--and the\r\ndumb-show ended.\r\n\r\nI saw Abraham Lincoln often the four years following that date. He\r\nchanged rapidly and much during his Presidency--but this scene, and him\r\nin it, are indelibly stamp'd upon my recollection. As I sat on the top\r\nof my omnibus, and had a good view of him, the thought, dim and inchoate\r\nthen, has since come out clear enough, that four sorts of genius, four\r\nmighty and primal hands, will be needed to the complete limning of this\r\nman's future portrait--the eyes and brains and finger-touch of Plutarch\r\nand Eschylus and Michel Angelo, assisted by Rabelais.\r\n\r\nAnd now--(Mr. Lincoln passing on from this scene to Washington, where\r\nhe was inaugurated, amid armed cavalry, and sharpshooters at every\r\npoint--the first instance of the kind in our history--and I hope it will\r\nbe the last)--now the rapid succession of well-known events, (too\r\nwell known--I believe, these days, we almost hate to hear them\r\nmention'd)--the national flag fired on at Sumter--the uprising of the\r\nNorth, in paroxysms of astonishment and rage--the chaos of divided\r\ncouncils--the call for troops--the first Bull Run--the stunning\r\ncast-down, shock, and dismay of the North--and so in full flood the\r\nsecession war. Four years of lurid, bleeding, murky, murderous war.\r\nWho paint those years, with all their scenes?--the hard-fought\r\nengagements--the defeats, plans, failures--the gloomy hours, days,\r\nwhen our Nationality seem'd hung in pall of doubt, perhaps death--the\r\nMephistophelean sneers of foreign lands and attachés--the dreaded\r\nScylla of European interference, and the Charybdis of the tremendously\r\ndangerous latent strata of secession sympathizers throughout the free\r\nStates, (far more numerous than is supposed)--the long marches\r\nin summer--the hot sweat, and many a sunstroke, as on the rush to\r\nGettysburg in '63--the night battles in the woods, as under Hooker\r\nat Chancellorsville--the camps in winter--the military prisons--the\r\nhospitals--(alas! alas! the hospitals.)\r\n\r\nThe secession war? Nay, let me call it the Union war. Though\r\nwhatever call'd, it is even yet too near us--too vast and too closely\r\novershadowing--its branches unform'd yet, (but certain,) shooting too\r\nfar into the future--and the most indicative and mightiest of them yet\r\nungrown. A great literature will yet arise out of the era of those\r\nfour years, those scenes--era compressing centuries of native passion,\r\nfirst-class pictures, tempests of life and death--an inexhaustible mine\r\nfor the histories, drama, romance, and even philosophy, of peoples to\r\ncome--indeed the verteber of poetry and art, (of personal character\r\ntoo,) for all future America--far more grand, in my opinion, to the\r\nhands capable of it, than Homer's siege of Troy, or the French wars to\r\nShakspere.\r\n\r\nBut I must leave these speculations, and come to the theme I have\r\nassign'd and limited myself to. Of the actual murder of President\r\nLincoln, though so much has been written, probably the facts are yet\r\nvery indefinite in most persons' minds. I read from my memoranda,\r\nwritten at the time, and revised frequently and finally since.\r\n\r\nThe day, April 14, 1865, seems to have been a pleasant one throughout\r\nthe whole land--the moral atmosphere pleasant too--the long storm, so\r\ndark, so fratricidal, full of blood and doubt and gloom, over and ended\r\nat last by the sun-rise of such an absolute National victory, and utter\r\nbreak-down of Secessionism--we almost doubted our own senses! Lee had\r\ncapitulated beneath the apple-tree of Appomattox. The other armies, the\r\nflanges of the revolt, swiftly follow'd. And could it really be, then?\r\nOut of all the affairs of this world of woe and failure and disorder,\r\nwas there really come the confirm'd, unerring sign of plan, like a\r\nshaft of pure light--of rightful rule--of God? So the day, as I say, was\r\npropitious. Early herbage, early flowers, were out. (I remember where\r\nI was stopping at the time, the season being advanced, there were many\r\nlilacs in full bloom. By one of those caprices that enter and give tinge\r\nto events without being at all a part of them, I find myself always\r\nreminded of the great tragedy of that day by the sight and odor of these\r\nblossoms. It never fails.)\r\n\r\nBut I must not dwell on accessories. The deed hastens. The popular\r\nafternoon paper of Washington, the little \"Evening Star,\" had spatter'd\r\nall over its third page, divided among the advertisements in a\r\nsensational manner, in a hundred different places, _The President and\r\nhis Lady will be at the Theatre this evening_.... (Lincoln was fond\r\nof the theatre. I have myself seen him there several times. I remember\r\nthinking how funny it was that he, in some respects the leading actor\r\nin the stormiest drama known to real history's stage through centuries,\r\nshould sit there and be so completely interested and absorb'd in those\r\nhuman jack-straws, moving about with their silly little gestures,\r\nforeign spirit, and flatulent text.)\r\n\r\nOn this occasion the theatre was crowded, many ladies in rich and gay\r\ncostumes, officers in their uniforms, many well-known citizens, young\r\nfolks, the usual clusters of gas-lights, the usual magnetism of so many\r\npeople, cheerful, with perfumes, music of violins and flutes--(and\r\nover all, and saturating all, that vast, vague wonder, _Victory_,\r\nthe nation's victory, the triumph of the Union, filling the air, the\r\nthought, the sense, with exhilaration more than all music and perfumes.)\r\n\r\nThe President came betimes, and, with his wife, witness'd the play\r\nfrom the large stage-boxes of the second tier, two thrown into one,\r\nand profusely drap'd with the national flag. The acts and scenes of the\r\npiece--one of those singularly written compositions which have at least\r\nthe merit of giving entire relief to an audience engaged in mental\r\naction or business excitements and cares during the day, as it makes\r\nnot the slightest call on either the moral, emotional, esthetic, or\r\nspiritual nature--a piece, (\"Our American Cousin,\") in which, among\r\nother characters, so call'd, a Yankee, certainly such a one as was never\r\nseen, or the least like it ever seen, in North America, is introduced\r\nin England, with a varied fol-de-rol of talk, plot, scenery, and such\r\nphantasmagoria as goes to make up a modern popular drama--had progress'd\r\nthrough perhaps a couple of its acts, when in the midst of this comedy,\r\nor non-such, or whatever it is to be call'd, and to offset it, or finish\r\nit out, as if in Nature's and the great Muse's mockery of those poor\r\nmimes, came interpolated that scene, not really or exactly to be\r\ndescribed at all, (for on the many hundreds who were there it seems\r\nto this hour to have left a passing blur, a dream, a blotch)--and yet\r\npartially to be described as I now proceed to give it. There is a scene\r\nin the play representing a modern parlor in which two unprecedented\r\nEnglish ladies are inform'd by the impossible Yankee that he is not\r\na man of fortune, and therefore undesirable for marriage-catching\r\npurposes; after which, the comments being finish'd, the dramatic trio\r\nmake exit, leaving the stage clear for a moment. At this period came the\r\nmurder of Abraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\nGreat as all its manifold train, circling round it, and stretching into\r\nthe future for many a century, in the politics, history, art, &c.,\r\nof the New World, in point of fact the main thing, the actual\r\nmurder, transpired with the quiet and simplicity of any commonest\r\noccurrence--the bursting of a bud or pod in the growth of vegetation,\r\nfor instance. Through the general hum following the stage pause, with\r\nthe change of positions, came the muffled sound of a pistol-shot, which\r\nnot one-hundredth part of the audience heard at the time--and yet a\r\nmoment's hush--somehow, surely, a vague startled thrill--and then,\r\nthrough the ornamented, draperied, starr'd and striped space-way of the\r\nPresident's box, a sudden figure, a man, raises himself with hands\r\nand feet, stands a moment on the railing, leaps below to the stage, (a\r\ndistance of perhaps fourteen or fifteen feet,) falls out of position,\r\ncatching his boot-heel in the copious drapery, (the American flag,)\r\nfalls on one knee, quickly recovers himself, rises as if nothing had\r\nhappen'd, (he really sprains his ankle, but unfelt then)--and so\r\nthe figure, Booth, the murderer, dress'd in plain black broadcloth,\r\nbare-headed, with full, glossy, raven hair, and his eyes like some mad\r\nanimal's flashing with light and resolution, yet with a certain strange\r\ncalmness, holds aloft in one hand a large knife--walks along not much\r\nback from the footlights--turns fully toward the audience his face\r\nof statuesque beauty, lit by those basilisk eyes, flashing with\r\ndesperation, perhaps insanity--launches out in a firm and steady voice\r\nthe words _Sic semper tyrannis_--and then walks with neither slow\r\nnor very rapid pace diagonally across to the back of the stage, and\r\ndisappears. (Had not all this terrible scene--making the mimic ones\r\npreposterous--had it not all been rehears'd, in blank, by Booth,\r\nbeforehand?)\r\n\r\nA moment's hush--a scream--the cry of _murder_--Mrs. Lincoln leaning out\r\nof the box, with ashy cheeks and lips, with involuntary cry, pointing\r\nto the retreating figure, _He has kill'd the President._ And still a\r\nmoment's strange, incredulous suspense--and then the deluge!--then that\r\nmixture of horror, noises, uncertainty--(the sound, somewhere back, of\r\na horse's hoofs clattering with speed)--the people burst through chairs\r\nand railings, and break them up--there is inextricable confusion\r\nand terror--women faint--quite feeble persons fall, and are trampl'd\r\non--many cries of agony are heard--the broad stage suddenly fills\r\nto suffocation with a dense and motley crowd, like some horrible\r\ncarnival--the audience rush generally upon it, at least the strong men\r\ndo--the actors and actresses are all there in their play-costumes and\r\npainted faces, with mortal fright showing through the rouge--the screams\r\nand calls, confused talk--redoubled, trebled--two or three manage to\r\npass up water from the stage to the President's box--others try to\r\nclamber up--&c., &c.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this, the soldiers of the President's guard,\r\nwith others, suddenly drawn to the scene, burst in--(some two hundred\r\naltogether)--they storm the house, through all the tiers, especially\r\nthe upper ones, inflam'd with fury, literally charging the audience with\r\nfix'd bayonets, muskets and pistols, snouting _Clear out! clear out!\r\nyou sons of_----.... Such the wild scene, or a suggestion of it rather,\r\ninside the play-house that night.\r\n\r\nOutside, too, in the atmosphere of shock and craze, crowds of people,\r\nfill'd with frenzy, ready to seize any outlet for it, come near\r\ncommitting murder several times on innocent individuals. One such case\r\nwas especially exciting. The infuriated crowd, through some chance, got\r\nstarted against one man, either for words he utter'd, or perhaps without\r\nany cause at all, and were proceeding at once to actually hang him on\r\na neighboring lamp-post, when he was rescued by a few heroic policemen,\r\nwho placed him in their midst, and fought their way slowly and amid\r\ngreat peril toward the station house. It was a fitting episode of the\r\nwhole affair. The crowd rushing and eddying to and fro--the night,\r\nthe yells, the pale faces, many frighten'd people trying in vain to\r\nextricate themselves--the attack'd man, not yet freed from the jaws\r\nof death, looking like a corpse--the silent, resolute, half-dozen\r\npolicemen, with no weapons but their little clubs, yet stern and steady\r\nthrough all those eddying swarms--made a fitting side-scene to the grand\r\ntragedy of the murder. They gain'd the station house with the protected\r\nman, whom they placed in security for the night, and discharged him in\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\nAnd in the midst of that pandemonium, infuriated soldiers, the audience\r\nand the crowd, the stage, and all its actors and actresses, its\r\npaint-pots, spangles, and gas-lights--the life blood from those veins,\r\nthe best and sweetest of the land, drips slowly down, and death's ooze\r\nalready begins its little bubbles on the lips.\r\n\r\nThus the visible incidents and surroundings of Abraham Lincoln's murder,\r\nas they really occur'd. Thus ended the attempted secession of these\r\nStates; thus the four years' war. But the main things come subtly\r\nand invisibly afterward, perhaps long afterward--neither military,\r\npolitical, nor (great as those are,) historical. I say, certain\r\nsecondary and indirect results, out of the tragedy of this death, are,\r\nin my opinion, greatest. Not the event of the murder itself. Not that\r\nMr. Lincoln strings the principal points and personages of the\r\nperiod, like beads, upon the single string of his career. Not that his\r\nidiosyncrasy, in its sudden appearance and disappearance, stamps this\r\nRepublic with a stamp more mark'd and enduring than any yet given by\r\nany one man--(more even than Washington's;)--but, join'd with these,\r\nthe immeasurable value and meaning of that whole tragedy lies, to me,\r\nin senses finally dearest to a nation, (and here all our own)--the\r\nimaginative and artistic senses--the literary and dramatic ones. Not in\r\nany common or low meaning of those terms, but a meaning precious to the\r\nrace, and to every age. A long and varied series of contradictory\r\nevents arrives at last at its highest poetic, single, central, pictorial\r\ndenouement. The whole involved, baffling, multiform whirl of the\r\nsecession period comes to a head, and is gather'd in one brief flash of\r\nlightning-illumination--one simple, fierce deed. Its sharp culmination,\r\nand as it were solution, of so many bloody and angry problems,\r\nillustrates those climax-moments on the stage of universal Time, where\r\nthe historic Muse at one entrance, and the tragic Muse at the other,\r\nsuddenly ringing down the curtain, close an immense act in the long\r\ndrama of creative thought, and give it radiation, tableau, stranger than\r\nfiction. Fit radiation--fit close! How the imagination--how the student\r\nloves these things! America, too, is to have them. For not in all\r\ngreat deaths, nor far or near--not Caesar in the Roman senate-house,\r\nor Napoleon passing away in the wild night-storm at St. Helena--not\r\nPaleologus, falling, desperately fighting, piled over dozens deep with\r\nGrecian corpses--not calm old Socrates, drinking the hemlock--outvies\r\nthat terminus of the secession war, in one man's life, here in our\r\nmidst, in our own time--that seal of the emancipation of three million\r\nslaves--that parturition and delivery of our at last really free\r\nRepublic, born again, henceforth to commence its career of genuine\r\nhomogeneous Union, compact, consistent with itself.\r\n\r\nNor will ever future American Patriots and Unionists, indifferently over\r\nthe whole land, or North or South, find a better moral to their lesson.\r\nThe final use of the greatest men of a Nation is, after all, not with\r\nreference to their deeds in themselves, or their direct bearing on their\r\ntimes or lands. The final use of a heroic-eminent life--especially of a\r\nheroic-eminent death--is its indirect filtering into the nation and the\r\nrace, and to give, often at many removes, but unerringly, age after age,\r\ncolor and fibre to the personalism of the youth and maturity of that\r\nage, and of mankind. Then there is a cement to the whole people,\r\nsubtler, more underlying, than any thing in written constitution, or\r\ncourts or armies--namely, the cement of a death identified thoroughly\r\nwith that people, at its head, and for its sake. Strange, (is it not?)\r\nthat battles, martyrs, agonies, blood, even assassination, should so\r\ncondense--perhaps only really, lastingly condense--a Nationality.\r\n\r\nI repeat it--the grand deaths of the race--the dramatic deaths of every\r\nnationality--are its most important inheritance-value--in some respects\r\nbeyond its literature and art--(as the hero is beyond his finest\r\nportrait, and the battle itself beyond its choicest song or epic.) Is\r\nnot here indeed the point underlying all tragedy? the famous pieces of\r\nthe Grecian masters--and all masters? Why, if the old Greeks had had\r\nthis man, what trilogies of plays--what epics--would have been made\r\nout of him! How the rhapsodes would have recited him! How quickly that\r\nquaint tall form would have enter'd into the region where men vitalize\r\ngods, and gods divinify men! But Lincoln, his times, his death--great\r\nas any, any age--belong altogether to our own, and our autochthonic.\r\n(Sometimes indeed I think our American days, our own stage--the actors\r\nwe know and have shaken hands, or talk'd with--more fateful than\r\nanything in Eschylus--more heroic than the fighters around Troy--afford\r\nkings of men for our Democracy prouder than Agamemnon--models of\r\ncharacter cute and hardy as Ulysses--deaths more pitiful than Priam's.)\r\n\r\nWhen, centuries hence, (as it must, in my opinion, be centuries hence\r\nbefore the life of these States, or of Democracy, can be really written\r\nand illustrated,) the leading historians and dramatists seek for some\r\npersonage, some special event, incisive enough to mark with deepest\r\ncut, and mnemonize, this turbulent Nineteenth century of ours, (not only\r\nthese States, but all over the political and social world)--something,\r\nperhaps, to close that gorgeous procession of European feudalism, with\r\nall its pomp and caste-prejudices, (of whose long train we in America\r\nare yet so inextricably the heirs)--something to identify with terrible\r\nidentification, by far the greatest revolutionary step in the history of\r\nthe United States, (perhaps the greatest of the world, our century)--the\r\nabsolute extirpation and erasure of slavery from the States--those\r\nhistorians will seek in vain for any point to serve more thoroughly\r\ntheir purpose, than Abraham Lincoln's death.\r\n\r\nDear to the Muse--thrice dear to Nationality--to the whole human\r\nrace--precious to this Union--precious to Democracy--unspeakably and\r\nforever precious--their first great Martyr Chief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO LETTERS\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nTO -- -- -- LONDON, ENGLAND\r\n\r\n_Camden, N.J., U.S. America, March 17th, 1876._ DEAR FRIEND:--Yours of\r\nthe 28th Feb. receiv'd, and indeed welcom'd. I am jogging along still\r\nabout the same in physical condition--still certainly no worse, and I\r\nsometimes lately suspect rather better, or at any rate more adjusted to\r\nthe situation. Even begin to think of making some move, some change of\r\nbase, &c.: the doctors have been advising it for over two years, but I\r\nhaven't felt to do it yet. My paralysis does not lift--I cannot walk\r\nany distance--I still have this baffling, obstinate, apparently chronic\r\naffection of the stomachic apparatus and liver: yet I get out of doors\r\na little every day--write and read in moderation--appetite sufficiently\r\ngood--(eat only very plain food, but always did that)--digestion\r\ntolerable--spirits unflagging. I have told you most of this before, but\r\nsuppose you might like to know it all again, up to date. Of course, and\r\npretty darkly coloring the whole, are bad spells, prostrations,\r\nsome pretty grave ones, intervals--and I have resign'd myself to the\r\ncertainty of permanent incapacitation from solid work: but things may\r\ncontinue at least in this half-and-half way for months, even years.\r\n\r\nMy books are out, the new edition; a set of which, immediately on\r\nreceiving your letter of 28th, I have sent you, (by mail, March 15,)\r\nand I suppose you have before this receiv'd them. My dear friend, your\r\noffers of help, and those of my other British friends, I think I fully\r\nappreciate, in the right spirit, welcome and acceptive--leaving the\r\nmatter altogether in your and their hands, and to your and their\r\nconvenience, discretion, leisure, and nicety. Though poor now, even to\r\npenury, I have not so far been deprived of any physical thing I need or\r\nwish whatever, and I feel confident I shall not in the future. During my\r\nemployment of seven years or more in Washington after the war (1865-'72)\r\nI regularly saved part of my wages: and, though the sum has now become\r\nabout exhausted by my expenses of the last three years, there are\r\nalready beginning at present welcome dribbles hitherward from the sales\r\nof my new edition, which I just job and sell, myself, (all through this\r\nillness, my book-agents for three years in New York successively, badly\r\ncheated me,) and shall continue to dispose of the books myself. And that\r\nis the way I should prefer to glean my support. In that way I cheerfully\r\naccept all the aid my friends find it convenient to proffer.\r\n\r\nTo repeat a little, and without undertaking details, understand, dear\r\nfriend, for yourself and all, that I heartily and most affectionately\r\nthank my British friends, and that I accept their sympathetic generosity\r\nin the same spirit in which I believe (nay, know) it is offer'd--that\r\nthough poor I am not in want--that I maintain good heart and cheer; and\r\nthat by far the most satisfaction to me (and I think it can be done, and\r\nbelieve it will be) will be to live, as long as possible, on the sales,\r\nby myself, of my own works, and perhaps, if practicable, by further\r\nwritings for the press.\r\n\r\nW. W.\r\n\r\nI am prohibited from writing too much, and I must make this candid\r\nstatement of the situation serve for all my dear friends over there.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nTO -- -- -- DRESDEN, SAXONY\r\n\r\n_Camden, New Jersey, U.S.A., Dec. 20, '81._ DEAR SIR:--Your letter\r\nasking definite endorsement to your translation of my \"Leaves of Grass\"\r\ninto Russian is just received, and I hasten to answer it. Most warmly\r\nand willingly I consent to the translation, and waft a prayerful God\r\nspeed to the enterprise.\r\n\r\nYou Russians and we Americans! Our countries so distant, so unlike at\r\nfirst glance--such a difference in social and political conditions,\r\nand our respective methods of moral and practical development the\r\nlast hundred years;--and yet in certain features, and vastest ones, so\r\nresembling each other. The variety of stock-elements and tongues, to\r\nbe resolutely fused in a common identity and union at all hazards--the\r\nidea, perennial through the ages, that they both have their historic and\r\ndivine mission--the fervent element of manly friendship throughout\r\nthe whole people, surpass'd by no other races--the grand expanse of\r\nterritorial limits and boundaries--the unform'd and nebulous state of\r\nmany things, not yet permanently settled, but agreed on all hands to\r\nbe the preparations of an infinitely greater future--the fact that both\r\nPeoples have their independent and leading positions to hold, keep, and\r\nif necessary, fight for, against the rest of the world--the deathless\r\naspirations at the inmost centre of each great community, so vehement,\r\nso mysterious, so abysmic--are certainly features you Russians and\r\nwe Americans possess in common. As my dearest dream is for an\r\ninternationality of poems and poets binding the lands of the earth\r\ncloser than all treaties and diplomacy--as the purpose beneath the rest\r\nin my book is such hearty comradeship, for individuals to begin with,\r\nand for all the nations of the earth as a result--how happy I should be\r\nto get the hearing and emotional contact of the great Russian peoples.\r\n\r\nTo whom, now and here, (addressing you for Russia and Russians and\r\nempowering you, should you see fit, to print the present letter, in your\r\nbook, as a preface,) I waft affectionate salutation from these shores,\r\nin America's name.\r\n\r\nW. W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES LEFT OVER\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONALITY--(AND YET) It is more and more clear to me that the main\r\nsustenance for highest separate personality, these States, is to come\r\nfrom that general sustenance of the aggregate, (as air, earth, rains,\r\ngive sustenance to a tree)--and that such personality, by democratic\r\nstandards, will only be fully coherent, grand and free, through the\r\ncohesion, grandeur and freedom of the common aggregate, the Union. Thus\r\nthe existence of the true American continental solidarity of the future,\r\ndepending on myriads of superb, large-sized, emotional and physically\r\nperfect individualities, of one sex just as much as the other, the\r\nsupply of such individualities, in my opinion, wholly depends on\r\na compacted imperial ensemble. The theory and practice of both\r\nsovereignties, contradictory as they are, are necessary. As the\r\ncentripetal law were fatal alone, or the centrifugal law deadly and\r\ndestructive alone, but together forming the law of eternal kosmical\r\naction, evolution, preservation, and life--so, by itself alone, the\r\nfullness of individuality, even the sanest, would surely destroy itself.\r\nThis is what makes the importance to the identities of these States\r\nof the thoroughly fused, relentless, dominating Union--a moral and\r\nspiritual idea, subjecting all the parts with remorseless power, more\r\nneeded by American democracy than by any of history's hitherto empires\r\nor feudalities, and the _sine qua non_ of carrying out the republican\r\nprinciple to develop itself in the New World through hundreds, thousands\r\nof years to come.\r\n\r\nIndeed, what most needs fostering through the hundred years to come, in\r\nall parts of the United States, north, south, Mississippi valley, and\r\nAtlantic and Pacific coasts, is this fused and fervent identity of the\r\nindividual, whoever he or she may be, and wherever the place, with the\r\nidea and fact of AMERICAN TOTALITY, and with what is meant by the Flag,\r\nthe stars and stripes. We need this conviction of nationality as a\r\nfaith, to be absorb'd in the blood and belief of the People everywhere,\r\nsouth, north, west, east, to emanate in their life, and in native\r\nliterature and art. We want the germinal idea that America, inheritor\r\nof the past, is the custodian of the future of humanity. Judging from\r\nhistory, it is some such moral and spiritual ideas appropriate to\r\nthem, (and such ideas only,) that have made the profoundest glory\r\nand endurance of nations in the past. The races of Judea, the classic\r\nclusters of Greece and Rome, and the feudal and ecclesiastical clusters\r\nof the Middle Ages, were each and all vitalized by their separate\r\ndistinctive ideas, ingrain'd in them, redeeming many sins, and indeed,\r\nin a sense, the principal reason-why for their whole career.\r\n\r\nThen, in the thought of nationality especially for the United States,\r\nand making them original, and different from all other countries,\r\nanother point ever remains to be considered. There are two distinct\r\nprinciples--aye, paradoxes--at the life-fountain and life-continuation\r\nof the States; one, the sacred principle of the Union, the right of\r\nensemble, at whatever sacrifice--and yet another, an equally sacred\r\nprinciple, the right of each State, consider'd as a separate sovereign\r\nindividual, in its own sphere. Some go zealously for one set of these\r\nrights, and some as zealously for the other set. We must have both; or\r\nrather, bred out of them, as out of mother and father, a third set, the\r\nperennial result and combination of both, and neither jeopardized. I\r\nsay the loss or abdication of one set, in the future, will be ruin to\r\ndemocracy just as much as the loss of the other set. The problem is,\r\nto harmoniously adjust the two, and the play of the two. [Observe the\r\nlesson of the divinity of Nature, ever checking the excess of one law,\r\nby an opposite, or seemingly opposite law--generally the other side of\r\nthe same law.] For the theory of this Republic is, not that the General\r\ngovernment is the fountain of all life and power, dispensing it forth,\r\naround, and to the remotest portions of our territory, but that THE\r\nPEOPLE are, represented in both, underlying both the General and State\r\ngovernments, and consider'd just as well in their individualities and\r\nin their separate aggregates, or States, as consider'd in one vast\r\naggregate, the Union. This was the original dual theory and\r\nfoundation of the United States, as distinguish'd from the feudal and\r\necclesiastical single idea of monarchies and papacies, and the divine\r\nright of kings. (Kings have been of use, hitherto, as representing the\r\nidea of the identity of nations. But, to American democracy, _both_\r\nideas must be fulfill'd, and in my opinion the loss of vitality of\r\neither one will indeed be the loss of vitality of the other.)\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERSON'S BOOKS, (THE SHADOWS OF THEM)\r\n\r\nIn the regions we call Nature, towering beyond all measurement, with\r\ninfinite spread, infinite depth and height--in those regions, including\r\nMan, socially and historically, with his moral-emotional influences--how\r\nsmall a part, (it came in my mind to-day,) has literature really\r\ndepicted--even summing up all of it, all ages. Seems at its best some\r\nlittle fleet of boats, hugging the shores of a boundless sea, and never\r\nventuring, exploring the unmapp'd--never, Columbus-like, sailing out for\r\nNew Worlds, and to complete the orb's rondure. Emerson writes frequently\r\nin the atmosphere of this thought, and his books report one or two\r\nthings from that very ocean and air, and more legibly address'd to\r\nour age and American polity than by any man yet. But I will begin by\r\nscarifying him--thus proving that I am not insensible to his deepest\r\nlessons. I will consider his books from a democratic and western point\r\nof view. I will specify the shadows on these sunny expanses. Somebody\r\nhas said of heroic character that \"wherever the tallest peaks are\r\npresent, must inevitably be deep chasms and valleys.\" Mine be the\r\nungracious task (for reasons) of leaving unmention'd both sunny expanses\r\nand sky-reaching heights, to dwell on the bare spots and darknesses. I\r\nhave a theory that no artist or work of the very first class may be or\r\ncan be without them.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, these pages are perhaps too perfect, too concentrated. (How\r\ngood, for instance, is good butter, good sugar. But to be eating nothing\r\nbut sugar and butter all the time! even if ever so good.) And though\r\nthe author has much to say of freedom and wildness and simplicity\r\nand spontaneity, no performance was ever more based on artificial\r\nscholarships and decorums at third or fourth removes, (he calls it\r\nculture,) and built up from them. It is always a _make_, never an\r\nunconscious _growth_. It is the porcelain figure or statuette of lion,\r\nor stag, or Indian hunter--and a very choice statuette too--appropriate\r\nfor the rosewood or marble bracket of parlor or library; never the\r\nanimal itself, or the hunter himself. Indeed, who wants the real animal\r\nor hunter? What would that do amid astral and bric-a-brac and tapestry,\r\nand ladies and gentlemen talking in subdued tones of Browning and\r\nLongfellow and art? The least suspicion of such actual bull, or Indian,\r\nor of Nature carrying out itself, would put all those good people to\r\ninstant terror and flight.\r\n\r\nEmerson, in my opinion, is not most eminent as poet or artist or\r\nteacher, though valuable in all those. He is best as critic, or\r\ndiagnoser. Not passion or imagination or warp or weakness, or any\r\npronounced cause or specialty, dominates him. Cold and bloodless\r\nintellectuality dominates him. (I know the fires, emotions, love,\r\negotisms, glow deep, perennial, as in all New Englanders--but the\r\nfaçade, hides them well--they give no sign.) He does not see or take one\r\nside, one presentation only or mainly, (as all the poets, or most of the\r\nfine writers anyhow)--he sees all sides. His final influence is to\r\nmake his students cease to worship anything--almost cease to believe in\r\nanything, outside of themselves. These books will fill, and well fill,\r\ncertain stretches of life, certain stages of development--are, (like\r\nthe tenets or theology the author of them preach'd when a young man,)\r\nunspeakably serviceable and precious as a stage. But in old or nervous\r\nor solemnest or dying hours, when one needs the impalpably soothing and\r\nvitalizing influences of abysmic Nature, or its affinities in literature\r\nor human society, and the soul resents the keenest mere intellection,\r\nthey will not be sought for.\r\n\r\nFor a philosopher, Emerson possesses a singularly dandified theory of\r\nmanners. He seems to have no notion at all that manners are simply the\r\nsigns by which the chemist or metallurgist knows his metals. To the\r\nprofound scientist, all metals are profound, as they really are. The\r\nlittle one, like the conventional world, will make much of gold and\r\nsilver only. Then to the real artist in humanity, what are called bad\r\nmanners are often the most picturesque and significant of all. Suppose\r\nthese books becoming absorb'd, the permanent chyle of American general\r\nand particular character--what a well-wash'd and grammatical, but\r\nbloodless and helpless, race we should turn out! No, no, dear friend;\r\nthough the States want scholars, undoubtedly, and perhaps want ladies\r\nand gentlemen who use the bath frequently, and never laugh loud, or talk\r\nwrong, they don't want scholars, or ladies and gentlemen, at the expense\r\nof all the rest. They want good farmers, sailors, mechanics, clerks,\r\ncitizens--perfect business and social relations--perfect fathers and\r\nmothers. If we could only have these, or their approximations, plenty\r\nof them, fine and large and sane and generous and patriotic, they might\r\nmake their verbs disagree from their nominatives, and laugh like volleys\r\nof musketeers, if they should please. Of course these are not all\r\nAmerica wants, but they are first of all to be provided on a large\r\nscale. And, with tremendous errors and escapades, this, substantially,\r\nis what the States seem to have an intuition of, and to be mainly aiming\r\nat. The plan of a select class, superfined, (demarcated from the rest,)\r\nthe plan of Old World lands and literatures, is not so objectionable in\r\nitself, but because it chokes the true plan for us, and indeed is death\r\nto it. As to such special class, the United States can never produce any\r\nequal to the splendid show, (far, far beyond comparison or competition\r\nhere,) of the principal European nations, both in the past and at the\r\npresent day. But an immense and distinctive commonalty over our vast and\r\nvaried area, west and east, south and north--in fact, for the first time\r\nin history, a great, aggregated, real PEOPLE, worthy the name, and made\r\nof develop'd heroic individuals, both sexes--is America's principal,\r\nperhaps only, reason for being. If ever accomplish'd, it will be at\r\nleast as much, (I lately think, doubly as much,) the result of fitting\r\nand democratic sociologies, literatures and arts--if we ever get\r\nthem--as of our democratic politics.\r\n\r\nAt times it has been doubtful to me if Emerson really knows or feels\r\nwhat Poetry is at its highest, as in the Bible, for instance, or Homer\r\nor Shakspere. I see he covertly or plainly likes best superb verbal\r\npolish, or something old or odd--Waller's \"Go, lovely rose,\" or\r\nLovelace's lines \"to Lucusta\"--the quaint conceits of the old French\r\nbards, and the like. Of _power_ he seems to have a gentleman's\r\nadmiration--but in his inmost heart the grandest attribute of God and\r\nPoets is always subordinate to the octaves, conceits, polite kinks, and\r\nverbs.\r\n\r\nThe reminiscence that years ago I began like most youngsters to have\r\na touch (though it came late, and was only on the surface) of\r\nEmerson-on-the-brain--that I read his writings reverently, and address'd\r\nhim in print as \"Master,\" and for a month or so thought of him as\r\nsuch--I retain not only with composure, but positive satisfaction. I\r\nhave noticed that most young people of eager minds pass through this\r\nstage of exercise.\r\n\r\nThe best part of Emersonianism is, it breeds the giant that destroys\r\nitself. Who wants to be any man's mere follower? lurks behind every\r\npage. No teacher ever taught, that has so provided for his pupil's\r\nsetting up independently--no truer evolutionist.\r\n\r\n\r\nVENTURES, ON AN OLD THEME\r\n\r\nA DIALOGUE--\r\n\r\n_One party says_--We arrange our lives--even the best and boldest men\r\nand women that exist, just as much as the most limited--with reference\r\nto what society conventionally rules and makes right. We retire to our\r\nrooms for freedom; to undress, bathe, unloose everything in freedom.\r\nThese, and much else, would not be proper in society.\r\n\r\n_Other party answers_--Such is the rule of society. Not always so, and\r\nconsiderable exceptions still exist. However, it must be called the\r\ngeneral rule, sanction'd by immemorial usage, and will probably always\r\nremain so.\r\n\r\n_First party_--Why not, then, respect it in your poems?\r\n\r\n_Answer_--One reason, and to me a profound one, is that the soul of a\r\nman or woman demands, enjoys compensation in the highest directions for\r\nthis very restraint of himself or herself, level'd to the average, or\r\nrather mean, low, however eternally practical, requirements of society's\r\nintercourse. To balance this indispensable abnegation, the free minds\r\nof poets relieve themselves, and strengthen and enrich mankind with free\r\nflights in all the directions not tolerated by ordinary society.\r\n\r\n_First party_--But must not outrage or give offence to it.\r\n\r\n_Answer_--No, not in the deepest sense--and do not, and cannot. The\r\nvast averages of time and the race _en masse_ settle these things. Only\r\nunderstand that the conventional standards and laws proper enough for\r\nordinary society apply neither to the action of the soul, nor its poets.\r\nIn fact the latter know no laws but the laws of themselves, planted in\r\nthem by God, and are themselves the last standards of the law, and its\r\nfinal exponents--responsible to Him directly, and not at all to mere\r\netiquette. Often the best service that can be done to the race, is\r\nto lift the veil, at least for a time, from these rules and\r\nfossil-etiquettes.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW POETRY--_California, Canada, Texas_.--In my opinion the time has\r\narrived to essentially break down the barriers of form between prose and\r\npoetry. I say the latter is henceforth to win and maintain its character\r\nregardless of rhyme, and the measurement-rules of iambic, spondee,\r\ndactyl, &c., and that even if rhyme and those measurements continue\r\nto furnish the medium for inferior writers and themes, (especially for\r\npersiflage and the comic, as there seems henceforward, to the perfect\r\ntaste, something inevitably comic in rhyme, merely in itself, and\r\nanyhow,) the truest and greatest _Poetry_, (while subtly and necessarily\r\nalways rhythmic, and distinguishable easily enough,) can never again, in\r\nthe English language, be express'd in arbitrary and rhyming metre, any\r\nmore than the greatest eloquence, or the truest power and passion. While\r\nadmitting that the venerable and heavenly forms of chiming versification\r\nhave in their time play'd great and fitting parts--that the pensive\r\ncomplaint, the ballads, wars, amours, legends of Europe, &c., have, many\r\nof them, been inimitably render'd in rhyming verse--that there have\r\nbeen very illustrious poets whose shapes the mantle of such verse\r\nhas beautifully and appropriately envelopt--and though the mantle\r\nhas fallen, with perhaps added beauty, on some of our own age--it is,\r\nnot-withstanding, certain to me, that the day of such conventional rhyme\r\nis ended. In America, at any rate, and as a medium of highest esthetic\r\npractical or spiritual expression, present or future, it palpably\r\nfails, and must fail, to serve. The Muse of the Prairies, of California,\r\nCanada, Texas, and of the peaks of Colorado, dismissing the literary,\r\nas well as social etiquette of over-sea feudalism and caste, joyfully\r\nenlarging, adapting itself to comprehend the size of the whole people,\r\nwith the free play, emotions, pride, passions, experiences, that belong\r\nto them, body and soul--to the general globe, and all its relations in\r\nastronomy, as the savans portray them to us--to the modern, the busy\r\nNineteenth century, (as grandly poetic as any, only different,)\r\nwith steamships, railroads, factories, electric telegraphs, cylinder\r\npresses--to the thought of the solidarity of nations, the brotherhood\r\nand sisterhood of the entire earth--to the dignity and heroism of the\r\npractical labor of farms, factories, foundries, workshops, mines, or\r\non shipboard, or on lakes and rivers--resumes that other medium of\r\nexpression, more flexible, more eligible--soars to the freer, vast,\r\ndiviner heaven of prose.\r\n\r\nOf poems of the third or fourth class, (perhaps even some of the\r\nsecond,) it makes little or no difference who writes them--they are good\r\nenough for what they are; nor is it necessary that they should be\r\nactual emanations from the personality and life of the writers. The very\r\nreverse sometimes gives piquancy. But poems of the first class, (poems\r\nof the depth, as distinguished from those of the surface,) are to be\r\nsternly tallied with the poets themselves, and tried by them and their\r\nlives. Who wants a glorification of courage and manly defiance from\r\na coward or a sneak?--a ballad of benevolence or chastity from some\r\nrhyming hunks, or lascivious, glib _roué_?\r\n\r\nIn these States, beyond all precedent, poetry will have to do with\r\nactual facts, with the concrete States, and--for we have not much more\r\nthan begun--with the definitive getting into shape of the Union. Indeed\r\nI sometimes think _it_ alone is to define the Union, (namely, to give\r\nit artistic character, spirituality, dignity.) What American humanity is\r\nmost in danger of is an overwhelming prosperity, \"business\" worldliness,\r\nmaterialism: what is most lacking, east, west, north, south, is a fervid\r\nand glowing Nationality and patriotism, cohering all the parts into one.\r\nWho may fend that danger, and fill that lack in the future, but a class\r\nof loftiest poets?\r\n\r\nIf the United States haven't grown poets, on any scale of grandeur,\r\nit is certain they import, print, and read more poetry than any equal\r\nnumber of people elsewhere--probably more than all the rest of the world\r\ncombined.\r\n\r\nPoetry (like a grand personality) is a growth of many generations--many\r\nrare combinations.\r\n\r\nTo have great poets, there must be great audiences, too.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH LITERATURE\r\n\r\nTo avoid mistake, I would say that I not only commend the study of\r\nthis literature, but wish our sources of supply and comparison vastly\r\nenlarged. American students may well derive from all former lands--from\r\nforenoon Greece and Rome, down to the perturb'd mediaeval times,\r\nthe Crusades, and so to Italy, the German intellect--all the older\r\nliteratures, and all the newer ones--from witty and warlike France,\r\nand markedly, and in many ways, and at many different periods, from the\r\nenterprise and soul of the great Spanish race--bearing ourselves\r\nalways courteous, always deferential, indebted beyond measure to the\r\nmother-world, to all its nations dead, as all its nations living--the\r\noffspring, this America of ours, the daughter, not by any means of the\r\nBritish isles exclusively, but of the continent, and all continents.\r\nIndeed, it is time we should realize and fully fructify those germs we\r\nalso hold from Italy, France, Spain, especially in the best imaginative\r\nproductions of those lands, which are, in many ways, loftier and subtler\r\nthan the English, or British, and indispensable to complete our service,\r\nproportions, education, reminiscences, &c.... The British element\r\nthese States hold, and have always held, enormously beyond its fit\r\nproportions. I have already spoken of Shakspere. He seems to me\r\nof astral genius, first class, entirely fit for feudalism. His\r\ncontributions, especially to the literature of the passions, are\r\nimmense, forever dear to humanity--and his name is always to be\r\nreverenced in America. But there is much in him ever offensive to\r\ndemocracy. He is not only the tally of feudalism, but I should say\r\nShakspere is incarnated, uncompromising feudalism, in literature. Then\r\none seems to detect something in him--I hardly know how to describe\r\nit--even amid the dazzle of his genius; and, in inferior manifestations,\r\nit is found in nearly all leading British authors. (Perhaps we will have\r\nto import the words Snob, Snobbish, &c., after all.) While of the great\r\npoems of Asian antiquity, the Indian epics, the book of Job, the Ionian\r\nIliad, the unsurpassedly simple, loving, perfect idyls of the life and\r\ndeath of Christ, in the New Testament, (indeed Homer and the Biblical\r\nutterances intertwine familiarly with us, in the main,) and along down,\r\nof most of the characteristic, imaginative or romantic relics of the\r\ncontinent, as the Cid, Cervantes' Don Quixote, &c., I should say they\r\nsubstantially adjust themselves to us, and, far off as they are, accord\r\ncuriously with our bed and board to-day, in New York, Washington,\r\nCanada, Ohio, Texas, California--and with our notions, both of\r\nseriousness and of fun, and our standards of heroism, manliness, and\r\neven the democratic requirements--those requirements are not only not\r\nfulfill'd in the Shaksperean productions, but are insulted on every\r\npage.\r\n\r\nI add that--while England is among the greatest of lands in political\r\nfreedom, or the idea of it, and in stalwart personal character, &c.--the\r\nspirit of English literature is not great, at least is not greatest--and\r\nits products are no models for us. With the exception of Shakspere,\r\nthere is no first-class genius in that literature--which, with a truly\r\nvast amount of value, and of artificial beauty, (largely from the\r\nclassics,) is almost always material, sensual, not spiritual--almost\r\nalways congests, makes plethoric, not frees, expands, dilates--is cold,\r\nanti-democratic, loves to be sluggish and stately, and shows much of\r\nthat characteristic of vulgar persons, the dread of saying or doing\r\nsomething not at all improper in itself, but unconventional, and that\r\nmay be laugh'd at. In its best, the sombre pervades it; it is moody,\r\nmelancholy, and, to give it its due, expresses, in characters and\r\nplots, those qualities, in an unrival'd manner. Yet not as the black\r\nthunder-storms, and in great normal, crashing passions, of the Greek\r\ndramatists--clearing the air, refreshing afterward, bracing with power;\r\nbut as in Hamlet, moping, sick, uncertain, and leaving ever after a\r\nsecret taste for the blues, the morbid fascination, the luxury of wo....\r\n\r\nI strongly recommend all the young men and young women of the United\r\nStates to whom it may be eligible, to overhaul the well-freighted\r\nfleets, the literatures of Italy, Spain, France, Germany, so full of\r\nthose elements of freedom, self-possession, gay-heartedness, subtlety,\r\ndilation, needed in preparations for the future of the States. I only\r\nwish we could have really good translations. I rejoice at the feeling\r\nfor Oriental researches and poetry, and hope it will go on.\r\n\r\n\r\nDARWINISM--(THEN FURTHERMORE)\r\n\r\nRunning through prehistoric ages--coming down from them into the\r\ndaybreak of our records, founding theology, suffusing literature, and so\r\nbrought onward--(a sort of verteber and marrow to all the antique races\r\nand lands, Egypt, India, Greece, Rome, the Chinese, the Jews, &c., and\r\ngiving cast and complexion to their art, poems, and their politics as\r\nwell as ecclesiasticism, all of which we more or less inherit,) appear\r\nthose venerable claims to origin from God himself, or from gods and\r\ngoddesses--ancestry from divine beings of vaster beauty, size, and power\r\nthan ours. But in current and latest times, the theory of human\r\norigin that seems to have most made its mark, (curiously reversing the\r\nantique,) is that we have come on, originated, developt, from monkeys,\r\nbaboons--a theory more significant perhaps in its indirections, or what\r\nit necessitates, than it is even in itself. (Of the twain, far apart as\r\nthey seem, and angrily as their conflicting advocates to-day oppose\r\neach other, are not both theories to be possibly reconcil'd, and even\r\nblended? Can we, indeed, spare either of them? Better still, out of\r\nthem is not a third theory, the real one, or suggesting the real one, to\r\narise?)\r\n\r\nOf this old theory, evolution, as broach'd anew, trebled, with indeed\r\nall-devouring claims, by Darwin, it has so much in it, and is so needed\r\nas a counterpoise to yet widely prevailing and unspeakably tenacious,\r\nenfeebling superstitions--is fused, by the new man, into such grand,\r\nmodest, truly scientific accompaniments--that the world of erudition,\r\nboth moral and physical, cannot but be eventually better'd and broaden'd\r\nin its speculations, from the advent of Darwinism. Nevertheless, the\r\nproblem of origins, human and other, is not the least whit nearer\r\nits solution. In due time the Evolution theory will have to abate its\r\nvehemence, cannot be allow'd to dominate every thing else, and will have\r\nto take its place as a segment of the circle, the cluster--as but one of\r\nmany theories, many thoughts, of profoundest value--and re-adjusting\r\nand differentiating much, yet leaving the divine secrets just as\r\ninexplicable and unreachable as before--maybe more so.\r\n\r\n_Then furthermore_--What is finally to be done by priest or poet--and by\r\npriest or poet only--amid all the stupendous and dazzling novelties\r\nof our century, with the advent of America, and of science and\r\ndemocracy--remains just as indispensable, after all the work of the\r\ngrand astronomers, chemists, linguists, historians, and explorers of the\r\nlast hundred years--and the wondrous German and other metaphysicians of\r\nthat time--and will continue to remain, needed, America and here,\r\njust the same as in the world of Europe, or Asia, of a hundred, or a\r\nthousand, or several thousand years ago. I think indeed _more_ needed,\r\nto furnish statements from the present points, the added arriere, and\r\nthe unspeakably immenser vistas of to-day. Only, the priests and poets\r\nof the modern, at least as exalted as any in the past, fully absorbing\r\nand appreciating the results of the past, in the commonalty of all\r\nhumanity, all time, (the main results already, for there is perhaps\r\nnothing more, or at any rate not much, strictly new, only more important\r\nmodern combinations, and new relative adjustments,) must indeed recast\r\nthe old metal, the already achiev'd material, into and through new\r\nmoulds, current forms.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the highest and subtlest and broadest truths of modern science\r\nwait for their true assignment and last vivid flashes of light--as\r\nDemocracy waits for it's--through first-class metaphysicians and\r\nspeculative philosophs--laying the basements and foundations for those\r\nnew, more expanded, more harmonious, more melodious, freer American\r\npoems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"SOCIETY\"\r\n\r\nI have myself little or no hope from what is technically called\r\n\"Society\" in our American cities. New York, of which place I have spoken\r\nso sharply, still promises something, in time, out of its tremendous\r\nand varied materials, with a certain superiority of intuitions, and the\r\nadvantage of constant agitation, and ever new and rapid dealings of\r\nthe cards. Of Boston, with its circles of social mummies, swathed in\r\ncerements harder than brass--its bloodless religion, (Unitarianism,)\r\nits complacent vanity of scientism and literature, lots of grammatical\r\ncorrectness, mere knowledge, (always wearisome, in itself)--its zealous\r\nabstractions, ghosts of reforms--I should say, (ever admitting its\r\nbusiness powers, its sharp, almost demoniac, intellect, and no lack, in\r\nits own way, of courage and generosity)--there is, at present, little\r\nof cheering, satisfying sign. In the West, California, &c., \"society\" is\r\nyet unform'd, puerile, seemingly unconscious of anything above a driving\r\nbusiness, or to liberally spend the money made by it, in the usual\r\nrounds and shows.\r\n\r\nThen there is, to the humorous observer of American attempts at fashion,\r\naccording to the models of foreign courts and saloons, quite a\r\ncomic side--particularly visible at Washington city--a sort of\r\nhigh-life-below-stairs business. As if any farce could be funnier,\r\nfor instance, than the scenes of the crowds, winter nights, meandering\r\naround our Presidents and their wives, cabinet officers, western or\r\nother Senators, Representatives, &c.; born of good laboring mechanic or\r\nfarmer stock and antecedents, attempting those full-dress receptions,\r\nfinesse of parlors, foreign ceremonies, etiquettes, &c.\r\n\r\nIndeed, consider'd with any sense of propriety, or any sense at all,\r\nthe whole of this illy-play'd fashionable play and display, with their\r\nabsorption of the best part of our wealthier citizens' time, money,\r\nenergies, &c., is ridiculously out of place in the United States. As if\r\nour proper man and woman, (far, far greater words than \"gentleman\"\r\nand \"lady,\") could still fail to see, and presently achieve, not this\r\nspectral business, but something truly noble, active, sane, American--by\r\nmodes, perfections of character, manners, costumes, social relations,\r\n&c., adjusted to standards, far, far different from those.\r\n\r\nEminent and liberal foreigners, British or continental, must at times\r\nhave their faith fearfully tried by what they see of our New World\r\npersonalities. The shallowest and least American persons seem surest\r\nto push abroad, and call without fail on well-known foreigners, who are\r\ndoubtless affected with indescribable qualms by these queer ones. Then,\r\nmore than half of our authors and writers evidently think it a\r\ngreat thing to be \"aristocratic,\" and sneer at progress, democracy,\r\nrevolution, etc. If some international literary snobs' gallery were\r\nestablish'd, it is certain that America could contribute at least her\r\nfull share of the portraits, and some very distinguish'd ones. Observe\r\nthat the most impudent slanders, low insults, &c., on the great\r\nrevolutionary authors, leaders, poets, &c., of Europe, have their origin\r\nand main circulation in certain circles here. The treatment of Victor\r\nHugo living, and Byron dead, are samples. Both deserving so well of\r\nAmerica, and both persistently attempted to be soil'd here by unclean\r\nbirds, male and female.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I must still offset the like of the foregoing, and all it\r\ninfers, by the recognition of the fact, that while the surfaces of\r\ncurrent society here show so much that is dismal, noisome, and vapory,\r\nthere are, beyond question, inexhaustible supplies, as of true gold ore,\r\nin the mines of America's general humanity. Let us, not ignoring the\r\ndross, give fit stress to these precious immortal values also. Let it\r\nbe distinctly admitted, that--whatever may be said of our fashionable\r\nsociety, and of any foul fractions and episodes--only here in America,\r\nout of the long history and manifold presentations of the ages, has at\r\nlast arisen, and now stands, what never before took positive form\r\nand sway, _the People_--and that view'd en masse, and while fully\r\nacknowledging deficiencies, dangers, faults, this people, inchoate,\r\nlatent, not yet come to majority, nor to its own religious, literary, or\r\nesthetic expression, yet affords, to-day, an exultant justification\r\nof all the faith, all the hopes and prayers and prophecies of good\r\nmen through the past--the stablest, solidest-based government of\r\nthe world--the most assured in a future--the beaming Pharos to whose\r\nperennial light all earnest eyes, the world over, are tending--and that\r\nalready, in and from it, the democratic principle, having been mortally\r\ntried by severest tests, fatalities of war and peace, now issues from\r\nthe trial, unharm'd, trebly-invigorated, perhaps to commence forthwith\r\nits finally triumphant march around the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRAMP AND STRIKE QUESTIONS: _Part of a Lecture proposed, (never\r\ndeliver'd)_\r\n\r\nTwo grim and spectral dangers--dangerous to peace, to health, to social\r\nsecurity, to progress--long known in concrete to the governments of the\r\nOld World, and there eventuating, more than once or twice, in dynastic\r\noverturns, bloodshed, days, months, of terror--seem of late years to\r\nbe nearing the New World, nay, to be gradually establishing themselves\r\namong us. What mean these phantoms here? (I personify them in fictitious\r\nshapes, but they are very real.) Is the fresh and broad demesne of\r\nAmerica destined also to give them foothold and lodgment, permanent\r\ndomicile?\r\n\r\nBeneath the whole political world, what most presses and perplexes\r\nto-day, sending vastest results affecting the future, is not the\r\nabstract question of democracy, but of social and economic organization,\r\nthe treatment of working-people by employers, and all that goes along\r\nwith it--not only the wages-payment part, but a certain spirit and\r\nprinciple, to vivify anew these relations; all the questions of\r\nprogress, strength, tariffs, finance, &c., really evolving themselves\r\nmore or less directly out of the Poverty Question, (\"the Science of\r\nWealth,\" and a dozen other names are given it, but I prefer the severe\r\none just used.) I will begin by calling the reader's attention to a\r\nthought upon the matter which may not have struck you before--the wealth\r\nof the civilized world, as contrasted with its poverty--what does it\r\nderivatively stand for, and represent? A rich person ought to have a\r\nstrong stomach. As in Europe the wealth of to-day mainly results from,\r\nand represents, the rapine, murder, outrages, treachery, hoggishness, of\r\nhundreds of years ago, and onward, later, so in America, after the same\r\ntoken--(not yet so bad, perhaps, or at any rate not so palpable--we have\r\nnot existed long enough--but we seem to be doing our best to make it\r\nup.)\r\n\r\nCurious as it may seem, it is in what are call'd the poorest, lowest\r\ncharacters you will sometimes, nay generally, find glints of the most\r\nsublime virtues, eligibilities, heroisms. Then it is doubtful whether\r\nthe State is to be saved, either in the monotonous long run, or in\r\ntremendous special crises, by its good people only. When the storm is\r\ndeadliest, and the disease most imminent, help often comes from strange\r\nquarters--(the homoeopathic motto, you remember, _cure the bite with a\r\nhair of the same dog.)_\r\n\r\nThe American Revolution of 1776 was simply a great strike, successful\r\nfor its immediate object--but whether a real success judged by the scale\r\nof the centuries, and the long-striking balance of Time, yet remains to\r\nbe settled. The French Revolution was absolutely a strike, and a very\r\nterrible and relentless one, against ages of bad pay, unjust division\r\nof wealth-products, and the hoggish monopoly of a few, rolling in\r\nsuperfluity, against the vast bulk of the work-people, living in\r\nsqualor.\r\n\r\nIf the United States, like the countries of the Old World, are also\r\nto grow vast crops of poor, desperate, dissatisfied, nomadic,\r\nmiserably-waged populations, such as we see looming upon us of late\r\nyears--steadily, even if slowly, eating into them like a cancer of lungs\r\nor stomach--then our republican experiment, notwithstanding all its\r\nsurface-successes, is at heart an unhealthy failure.\r\n\r\n_Feb. '79._--I saw to-day a sight I had never seen before--and it\r\namazed, and made me serious; three quite good-looking American men,\r\nof respectable personal presence, two of them young, carrying\r\nchiffonier-bags on their shoulders, and the usual long iron hooks in\r\ntheir hands, plodding along, their eyes cast down, spying for scraps,\r\nrags, bones, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEMOCRACY IN THE NEW WORLD\r\n\r\nEstimated and summ'd-up to-day, having thoroughly justified itself\r\nthe past hundred years, (as far as growth, vitality and power are\r\nconcern'd,) by severest and most varied trials of peace and war,\r\nand having establish'd itself for good, with all its necessities and\r\nbenefits, for time to come, is now to be seriously consider'd also\r\nin its pronounc'd and already developt dangers. While the battle was\r\nraging, and the result suspended, all defections and criticisms were\r\nto be hush'd, and everything bent with vehemence unmitigated toward the\r\nurge of victory. But that victory settled, new responsibilities advance.\r\nI can conceive of no better service in the United States, henceforth,\r\nby democrats of thorough and heart-felt faith, than boldly exposing\r\nthe weakness, liabilities and infinite corruptions of democracy. By the\r\nunprecedented opening-up of humanity en-masse in the United States, the\r\nlast hundred years, under our institutions, not only the good qualities\r\nof the race, but just as much the bad ones, are prominently brought\r\nforward. Man is about the same, in the main, whether with despotism, or\r\nwhether with freedom.\r\n\r\n\"The ideal form of human society,\" Canon Kingsley declares, \"is\r\ndemocracy. A nation--and were it even possible, a whole world--of free\r\nmen, lifting free foreheads to God and Nature; calling no man master,\r\nfor One is their master, even God; knowing and doing their duties toward\r\nthe Maker of the universe, and therefore to each other; not from fear,\r\nnor calculation of profit or loss, but because they have seen the beauty\r\nof righteousness, and trust, and peace; because the law of God is in\r\ntheir hearts. Such a nation--such a society--what nobler conception of\r\nmoral existence can we form? Would not that, indeed, be the kingdom of\r\nGod come on earth?\"\r\n\r\nTo this faith, founded in the ideal, let us hold--and never abandon\r\nor lose it. Then what a spectacle is _practically_ exhibited by our\r\nAmerican democracy to-day!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUNDATION STAGES--THEN OTHERS\r\n\r\nThough I think I fully comprehend the absence of moral tone in our\r\ncurrent politics and business, and the almost entire futility of\r\nabsolute and simple honor as a counterpoise against the enormous greed\r\nfor worldly wealth, with the trickeries of gaining it, all through\r\nsociety our day, I still do not share the depression and despair on the\r\nsubject which I find possessing many good people. The advent of America,\r\nthe history of the past century, has been the first general aperture and\r\nopening-up to the average human commonalty, on the broadest scale, of\r\nthe eligibilities to wealth and worldly success and eminence, and has\r\nbeen fully taken advantage of; and the example has spread hence, in\r\nripples, to all nations. To these eligibilities--to this limitless\r\naperture, the race has tended, en-masse, roaring and rushing and crude,\r\nand fiercely, turbidly hastening--and we have seen the first stages,\r\nand are now in the midst of the result of it all, so far. But there will\r\ncertainly ensue other stages, and entirely different ones. In nothing\r\nis there more evolution than the American mind. Soon, it will be fully\r\nrealized that ostensible wealth and money-making, show, luxury, &c.,\r\nimperatively necessitate something beyond--namely, the sane, eternal\r\nmoral and spiritual-esthetic attributes, elements. (We cannot have even\r\nthat realization on any less terms than the price we are now paying\r\nfor it.) Soon, it will be understood clearly, that the State cannot\r\nflourish, (nay, cannot exist,) without those elements. They will\r\ngradually enter into the chyle of sociology and literature. They will\r\nfinally make the blood and brawn of the best American individualities\r\nof both sexes--and thus, with them, to a certainty, (through these very\r\nprocesses of to-day,) dominate the New World.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL SUFFRAGE, ELECTIONS, ETC.\r\n\r\nIt still remains doubtful to me whether these will ever secure,\r\nofficially, the best wit and capacity--whether, through them, the\r\nfirst-class genius of America will ever personally appear in the high\r\npolitical stations, the Presidency, Congress, the leading State\r\noffices, &c. Those offices, or the candidacy for them, arranged, won,\r\nby caucusing, money, the favoritism or pecuniary interest of rings, the\r\nsuperior manipulation of the ins over the outs, or the outs over the\r\nins, are, indeed, at best, the mere business agencies of the people, are\r\nuseful as formulating, neither the best and highest, but the average\r\nof the public judgment, sense, justice, (or sometimes want of judgment,\r\nsense, justice.) We elect Presidents, Congressmen, &c., not so much to\r\nhave them consider and decide for us, but as surest practical means of\r\nexpressing the will of majorities on mooted questions, measures, &c.\r\n\r\nAs to general suffrage, after all, since we have gone so far, the more\r\ngeneral it is, the better. I favor the widest opening of the doors. Let\r\nthe ventilation and area be wide enough, and all is safe. We can never\r\nhave a born penitentiary-bird, or panel-thief, or lowest gambling-hell\r\nor groggery keeper, for President--though such may not only emulate, but\r\nget, high offices from localities--even from the proud and wealthy city\r\nof New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHO GETS THE PLUNDER?\r\n\r\nThe protectionists are fond of flashing to the public eye the glittering\r\ndelusion of great money-results from manufactures, mines, artificial\r\nexports--so many millions from this source, and so many from that--such\r\na seductive, unanswerable show--an immense revenue of annual cash from\r\niron, cotton, woollen, leather goods, and a hundred other things, all\r\nbolstered up by \"protection.\" But the really important point of all\r\nis, _into whose pockets does this plunder really go?_ It would be some\r\nexcuse and satisfaction if even a fair proportion of it went to the\r\nmasses of laboring-men--resulting in homesteads to such, men, women,\r\nchildren--myriads of actual homes in fee simple, in every State, (not\r\nthe false glamour of the stunning wealth reported in the census, in\r\nthe statistics, or tables in the newspapers,) but a fair division\r\nand generous average to those workmen and workwomen--_that_ would be\r\nsomething. But the fact itself is nothing of the kind. The profits of\r\n\"protection\" go altogether to a few score select persons--who, by\r\nfavors of Congress, State legislatures, the banks, and other special\r\nadvantages, are forming a vulgar aristocracy, full as bad as anything in\r\nthe British or European castes, of blood, or the dynasties there of the\r\npast. As Sismondi pointed out, the true prosperity of a nation is not in\r\nthe great wealth of a special class, but is only to be really attain'd\r\nin having the bulk of the people provided with homes or land in fee\r\nsimple. This may not be the best show, but it is the best reality.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIENDSHIP, (THE REAL ARTICLE)\r\n\r\nThough Nature maintains, and must prevail, there will always be plenty\r\nof people, and good people, who cannot, or think they cannot, see\r\nanything in that last, wisest, most envelop'd of proverbs, \"Friendship\r\nrules the World.\" Modern society, in its largest vein, is essentially\r\nintellectual, infidelistic--secretly admires, and depends most on,\r\npure compulsion or science, its rule and sovereignty--is, in short, in\r\n\"cultivated\" quarters, deeply Napoleonic.\r\n\r\n\"Friendship,\" said Bonaparte, in one of his lightning-flashes of\r\ncandid garrulity, \"Friendship is but a name. I love no one--not even my\r\nbrothers; Joseph perhaps a little. Still, if I do love him, it is from\r\nhabit, because he is the eldest of us. Duroc? Ay, him, if any one,\r\nI love in a sort--but why? He suits me; he is cool, undemonstrative,\r\nunfeeling--has no weak affections--never embraces any one--never weeps.\"\r\n\r\nI am not sure but the same analogy is to be applied, in cases, often\r\nseen, where, with an extra development and acuteness of the intellectual\r\nfaculties, there is a mark'd absence of the spiritual, affectional, and\r\nsometimes, though more rarely, the highest esthetic and moral elements\r\nof cognition.\r\n\r\n\r\nLACKS AND WANTS YET\r\n\r\nOf most foreign countries, small or large, from the remotest times\r\nknown, down to our own, each has contributed after its kind, directly\r\nor indirectly, at least one great undying song, to help vitalize and\r\nincrease the valor, wisdom, and elegance of humanity, from the points of\r\nview attain'd by it up to date. The stupendous epics of India, the holy\r\nBible itself, the Homeric canticles, the Nibelungen, the Cid Campeador,\r\nthe Inferno, Shakspere's dramas of the passions and of the feudal lords,\r\nBurns's songs, Goethe's in Germany, Tennyson's poems in England, Victor\r\nHugo's in France, and many more, are the widely various yet integral\r\nsigns or land-marks, (in certain respects the highest set up by the\r\nhuman mind and soul, beyond science, invention, political amelioration,\r\n&c.,) narrating in subtlest, best ways, the long, long routes of\r\nhistory, and giving identity to the stages arrived at by aggregate\r\nhumanity, and the conclusions assumed in its progressive and varied\r\ncivilizations.... Where is America's art-rendering, in any thing like\r\nthe spirit worthy of herself and the modern, to these characteristic\r\nimmortal monuments? So far, our Democratic society, (estimating its\r\nvarious strata, in the mass, as one,) possesses nothing--nor have we\r\ncontributed any characteristic music, the finest tie of nationality--to\r\nmake up for that glowing, blood-throbbing, religious, social, emotional,\r\nartistic, indefinable, indescribably beautiful charm and hold which\r\nfused the separate parts of the old feudal societies together, in their\r\nwonderful interpenetration, in Europe and Asia, of love, belief,\r\nand loyalty, running one way like a living weft--and picturesque\r\nresponsibility, duty, and blessedness, running like a warp the other\r\nway. (In the Southern States, under slavery, much of the same.)...\r\nIn coincidence, and as things now exist in the States, what is more\r\nterrible, more alarming, than the total want of any such fusion\r\nand mutuality of love, belief, and rapport of interest, between\r\nthe comparatively few successful rich, and the great masses of the\r\nunsuccessful, the poor? As a mixed political and social question, is not\r\nthis full of dark significance? Is it not worth considering as a problem\r\nand puzzle in our democracy--an indispensable want to be supplied?\r\n\r\n\r\nRULERS STRICTLY OUT OF THE MASSES\r\n\r\nIn the talk (which I welcome) about the need of men of training,\r\nthoroughly school'd and experienced men, for statesmen, I would present\r\nthe following as an offset. It was written by me twenty years ago--and\r\nhas been curiously verified since:\r\n\r\nI say no body of men are fit to make Presidents, Judges, and Generals,\r\nunless they themselves supply the best specimens of the same; and that\r\nsupplying one or two such specimens illuminates the whole body for a\r\nthousand years. I expect to see the day when the like of the present\r\npersonnel of the governments, Federal, State, municipal, military, and\r\nnaval, will be look'd upon with derision, and when qualified mechanics\r\nand young men will reach Congress and other official stations, sent\r\nin their working costumes, fresh from their benches and tools, and\r\nreturning to them again with dignity. The young fellows must prepare\r\nto do credit to this destiny, for the stuff is in them. Nothing gives\r\nplace, recollect, and never ought to give place, except to its clean\r\nsuperiors. There is more rude and undevelopt bravery, friendship,\r\nconscientiousness, clear-sightedness, and practical genius for any\r\nscope of action, even the broadest and highest, now among the American\r\nmechanics and young men, than in all the official persons in these\r\nStates, legislative, executive, judicial, military, and naval, and more\r\nthan among all the literary persons. I would be much pleas'd to see some\r\nheroic, shrewd, fully-inform'd, healthy-bodied, middle-aged, beard-faced\r\nAmerican blacksmith or boatman come down from the West across the\r\nAlleghanies, and walk into the Presidency, dress'd in a clean suit of\r\nworking attire, and with the tan all over his face, breast, and arms;\r\nI would certainly vote for that sort of man, possessing the due\r\nrequirements, before any other candidate.\r\n\r\n(The facts of rank-and-file workingmen, mechanics, Lincoln, Johnson,\r\nGrant, Garfield, brought forward from the masses and placed in the\r\nPresidency, and swaying its mighty powers with firm hand--really with\r\nmore sway than any king in history, and with better capacity in using\r\nthat sway--can we not see that these facts have bearings far, far beyond\r\ntheir political or party ones?)\r\n\r\n\r\nMONUMENTS--THE PAST AND PRESENT\r\n\r\nIf you go to Europe, (to say nothing of Asia, more ancient and massive\r\nstill,) you cannot stir without meeting venerable mementos--cathedrals,\r\nruins of temples, castles, monuments of the great, statues and\r\npaintings, (far, far beyond anything America can ever expect to\r\nproduce,) haunts of heroes long dead, saints, poets, divinities, with\r\ndeepest associations of ages. But here in the New World, while _those_\r\nwe can never emulate, we have _more_ than those to build, and far more\r\ngreatly to build. (I am not sure but the day for conventional monuments,\r\nstatues, memorials, &c., has pass'd away--and that they are henceforth\r\nsuperfluous and vulgar.) An enlarg'd general superior humanity, (partly\r\nindeed resulting from those,) we are to build. European, Asiatic\r\ngreatness are in the past. Vaster and subtler, America, combining,\r\njustifying the past, yet works for a grander future, in living\r\ndemocratic forms. (Here too are indicated the paths for our national\r\nbards.) Other times, other lands, have had their missions--Art, War,\r\nEcclesiasticism, Literature, Discovery, Trade, Architecture, &c.,\r\n&c.--but that grand future is the enclosing purport of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE OR NOTHING NEW, AFTER ALL\r\n\r\nHow small were the best thoughts, poems, conclusions, except for\r\na certain invariable resemblance and uniform standard in the final\r\nthoughts, theology, poems, &c., of all nations, all civilizations, all\r\ncenturies and times. Those precious legacies--accumulations! They come\r\nto us from the far-off--from all eras, and all lands--from Egypt, and\r\nIndia, and Greece, and Rome--and along through the middle and later\r\nages, in the grand monarchies of Europe--born under far different\r\ninstitutes and conditions from ours--but out of the insight and\r\ninspiration of the same old humanity--the same old heart and brain--the\r\nsame old countenance yearningly, pensively, looking forth. What we have\r\nto do to-day is to receive them cheerfully, and to give them ensemble,\r\nand a modern American and democratic physiognomy.\r\n\r\n\r\nA LINCOLN REMINISCENCE\r\n\r\nAs is well known, story-telling was often with President Lincoln a\r\nweapon which he employ'd with great skill. Very often he could not\r\ngive a point-blank reply or comment--and these indirections, (sometimes\r\nfunny, but not always so,) were probably the best responses possible. In\r\nthe gloomiest period of the war, he had a call from a large delegation\r\nof bank presidents. In the talk after business was settled, one of the\r\nbig Dons asked Mr. Lincoln if his confidence in the permanency of the\r\nUnion was not beginning to be shaken--whereupon the homely President\r\ntold a little story: \"When I was a young man in Illinois,\" said he, \"I\r\nboarded for a time with a deacon of the Presbyterian church. One night I\r\nwas roused from my sleep by a rap at the door, and I heard the deacon's\r\nvoice exclaiming, 'Arise, Abraham! the day of judgment has come!' I\r\nsprang from my bed and rushed to the window, and saw the stars falling\r\nin great showers; but looking back of them in the heavens I saw the\r\ngrand old constellations, with which I was so well acquainted, fixed and\r\ntrue in their places. Gentlemen, the world did not come to an end then,\r\nnor will the Union now.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFREEDOM\r\n\r\nIt is not only true that most people entirely misunderstand Freedom, but\r\nI sometimes think I have not yet met one person who rightly understands\r\nit. The whole Universe is absolute Law. Freedom only opens entire\r\nactivity and license _under the law_. To the degraded or undevelopt--and\r\neven to too many others--the thought of freedom is a thought of escaping\r\nfrom law--which, of course, is impossible. More precious than all\r\nworldly riches is Freedom--freedom from the painful constipation and\r\npoor narrowness of ecclesiasticism--freedom in manners, habiliments,\r\nfurniture, from the silliness and tyranny of local fashions--entire\r\nfreedom from party rings and mere conventions in Politics--and better\r\nthan all, a general freedom of One's-Self from the tyrannic domination\r\nof vices, habits, appetites, under which nearly every man of us, (often\r\nthe greatest brawler for freedom,) is enslav'd. Can we attain such\r\nenfranchisement--the true Democracy, and the height of it? While we are\r\nfrom birth to death the subjects of irresistible law, enclosing every\r\nmovement and minute, we yet escape, by a paradox, into true free will.\r\nStrange as it may seem, we only attain to freedom by a knowledge of, and\r\nimplicit obedience to, Law. Great--unspeakably great--is the Will! the\r\nfree Soul of man! At its greatest, understanding and obeying the laws,\r\nit can then, and then only, maintain true liberty. For there is to the\r\nhighest, that law as absolute as any--more absolute than any--the Law of\r\nLiberty. The shallow, as intimated, consider liberty a release from all\r\nlaw, from every constraint. The wise see in it, on the contrary, the\r\npotent Law of Laws, namely, the fusion and combination of the conscious\r\nwill, or partial individual law, with those universal, eternal,\r\nunconscious ones, which run through all Time, pervade history, prove\r\nimmortality, give moral purpose to the entire objective world, and the\r\nlast dignity to human life.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK-CLASSES--AMERICA'S LITERATURE\r\n\r\nFor certain purposes, literary productions through all the recorded ages\r\nmay be roughly divided into two classes. The first consisting of only\r\na score or two, perhaps less, of typical, primal, representative works,\r\ndifferent from any before, and embodying in themselves their own main\r\nlaws and reasons for being. Then the second class, books and writings\r\ninnumerable, incessant--to be briefly described as radiations or\r\noffshoots, or more or less imitations of the first. The works of the\r\nfirst class, as said, have their own laws, and may indeed be described\r\nas making those laws, and amenable only to them. The sharp warning of\r\nMargaret Fuller, unquell'd for thirty years, yet sounds in the air:\r\n\"It does not follow that because the United States print and read more\r\nbooks, magazines, and newspapers than all the rest of the world, that\r\nthey really have, therefore, a literature.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR REAL CULMINATION\r\n\r\nThe final culmination of this vast and varied Republic will be the\r\nproduction and perennial establishment of millions of comfortable city\r\nhomesteads and moderate-sized farms, healthy and independent, single\r\nseparate ownership, fee simple, life in them complete but cheap, within\r\nreach of all. Exceptional wealth, splendor, countless manufactures,\r\nexcess of exports, immense capital and capitalists, the\r\nfive-dollar-a-day hotels well fill'd, artificial improvements, even\r\nbooks, colleges, and the suffrage--all, in many respects, in themselves,\r\n(hard as it is to say so, and sharp as a surgeon's lance,) form, more or\r\nless, a sort of anti-democratic disease and monstrosity, except as\r\nthey contribute by curious indirections to that culmination--seem to me\r\nmainly of value, or worth consideration, only with reference to it.\r\n\r\nThere is a subtle something in the common earth, crops, cattle, air,\r\ntrees, &c., and in having to do at first hand with them, that forms the\r\nonly purifying and perennial element for individuals and for society.\r\nI must confess I want to see the agricultural occupation of America at\r\nfirst hand permanently broaden'd. Its gains are the only ones on which\r\nGod seems to smile. What others--what business, profit, wealth, without\r\na taint? What fortune else--what dollar--does not stand for, and come\r\nfrom, more or less imposition, lying, unnaturalness?\r\n\r\n\r\nAN AMERICAN PROBLEM\r\n\r\nOne of the problems presented in America these times is, how to\r\ncombine one's duty and policy as a member of associations, societies,\r\nbrotherhoods or what not, and one's obligations to the State and Nation,\r\nwith essential freedom as an individual personality, without which\r\nfreedom a man cannot grow or expand, or be full, modern, heroic,\r\ndemocratic, American. With all the necessities and benefits of\r\nassociation, (and the world cannot get along without it,) the true\r\nnobility and satisfaction of a man consist in his thinking and acting\r\nfor himself. The problem, I say, is to combine the two, so as not to\r\nignore either.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAST COLLECTIVE COMPACTION\r\n\r\nI like well our polyglot construction-stamp, and the retention thereof,\r\nin the broad, the tolerating, the many-sided, the collective. All\r\nnations here--a home for every race on earth. British, German,\r\nScandinavian, Spanish, French, Italian--papers published, plays acted,\r\nspeeches made, in all languages--on our shores the crowning resultant\r\nof those distillations, decantations, compactions of humanity, that have\r\nbeen going on, on trial, over the earth so long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIECES IN EARLY YOUTH\r\n\r\n1834-'42\r\n\r\n\r\nDOUGH-FACE SONG --Like dough; soft; yielding to pressure;\r\npale----_Webster's Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n    We are all docile dough-faces,\r\n      They knead us with the fist,\r\n    They, the dashing southern lords,\r\n      We labor as they list;\r\n    For them we speak--or hold our tongues,\r\n      For them we turn and twist.\r\n\r\n    We join them in their howl against\r\n      Free soil and \"abolition,\"\r\n    That firebrand--that assassin knife--\r\n      Which risk our land's condition,\r\n    And leave no peace of life to any\r\n      Dough-faced politician.\r\n\r\n    To put down \"agitation,\" now,\r\n      We think the most judicious;\r\n    To damn all \"northern fanatics,\"\r\n      Those \"traitors\" black and vicious;\r\n    The \"reg'lar party usages\"\r\n      For us, and no \"new issues.\"\r\n\r\n    Things have come to a pretty pass,\r\n      When a trifle small as this,\r\n    Moving and bartering nigger slaves,\r\n      Can open an abyss,\r\n    With jaws a-gape for \"the two great parties;\"\r\n      A pretty thought, I wis!\r\n\r\n    Principle--freedom!--fiddlesticks!\r\n      We know not where they're found.\r\n    Rights of the masses--progress!--bah!\r\n      Words that tickle and sound;\r\n    But claiming to rule o'er \"practical men\"\r\n      Is very different ground.\r\n\r\n    Beyond all such we know a term\r\n      Charming to ears and eyes,\r\n    With it we'll stab young Freedom,\r\n      And do it in disguise;\r\n\r\n    Speak soft, ye wily dough-faces--\r\n      That term is \"compromise.\"\r\n\r\n    And what if children, growing up,\r\n      In future seasons read\r\n    The thing we do? and heart and tongue\r\n      Accurse us for the deed?\r\n    The future cannot touch us;\r\n      The present gain we heed.\r\n\r\n    Then, all together, dough-faces!\r\n      Let's stop the exciting clatter,\r\n    And pacify slave-breeding wrath\r\n      By yielding all the matter;\r\n    For otherwise, as sure as guns,\r\n      The Union it will shatter.\r\n\r\n    Besides, to tell the honest truth\r\n      (For us an innovation,)\r\n    Keeping in with the slave power\r\n      Is our personal salvation;\r\n    We've very little to expect\r\n      From t' other part of the nation.\r\n\r\n    Besides it's plain at Washington\r\n      Who likeliest wins the race,\r\n    What earthly chance has \"free soil\"\r\n      For any good fat place?\r\n    While many a daw has feather'd his nest,\r\n      By his creamy and meek dough-face.\r\n\r\n    Take heart, then, sweet companions,\r\n      Be steady, Scripture Dick!\r\n    Webster, Cooper, Walker,\r\n      To your allegiance stick!\r\n    With Brooks, and Briggs and Phoenix,\r\n      Stand up through thin and thick!\r\n\r\n    We do not ask a bold brave front;\r\n      We never try that game;\r\n    'Twould bring the storm upon our heads,\r\n      A huge mad storm of shame;\r\n    Evade it, brothers--\"compromise\"\r\n      Will answer just the same.\r\n\r\nPAUMANOK.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH IN THE SCHOOL-ROOM (_A Fact_)\r\n\r\nTing-a-ling-ling-ling! went the little bell on the teacher's desk of a\r\nvillage-school one morning, when the studies of the earlier part of the\r\nday were about half completed. It was well understood that this was a\r\ncommand for silence and attention; and when these had been obtained, the\r\nmaster spoke. He was a low thick-set man, and his name was Lugare.\r\n\r\n\"Boys,\" said he, \"I have had a complaint enter'd, that last night some\r\nof you were stealing fruit from Mr. Nichols's garden. I rather think I\r\nknow the thief. Tim Barker, step up here, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe one to whom he spoke came forward. He was a slight, fair-looking boy\r\nof about thirteen; and his face had a laughing, good-humor'd expression,\r\nwhich even the charge now preferr'd against him, and the stern tone\r\nand threatening look of the teacher, had not entirely dissipated. The\r\ncountenance of the boy, however, was too unearthly fair for health; it\r\nhad, notwithstanding its fleshy, cheerful look, a singular cast as if\r\nsome inward disease, and that a fearful one, were seated within. As the\r\nstripling stood before that place of judgment--that place so often\r\nmade the scene of heartless and coarse brutality, of timid innocence\r\nconfused, helpless child-hood outraged, and gentle feelings crush'\r\nd--Lugare looked on him with a frown which plainly told that he felt in\r\nno very pleasant mood. (Happily a worthier and more philosophical system\r\nis proving to men that schools can be better govern'd than by lashes and\r\ntears and sighs. We are waxing toward that consummation when one of the\r\nold-fashion'd school-masters, with his cowhide, his heavy birch-rod,\r\nand his many ingenious methods of child-torture, will be gazed upon as\r\na scorn'd memento of an ignorant, cruel, and exploded doctrine. May\r\npropitious gales speed that day!)\r\n\r\n\"Were you by Mr. Nichols's garden-fence last night?\" said Lugare.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" answer'd the boy, \"I was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, I'm glad to find you so ready with your confession. And\r\nso you thought you could do a little robbing, and enjoy yourself in a\r\nmanner you ought to be ashamed to own, without being punish'd, did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not been robbing,\" replied the boy quickly. His face was\r\nsuffused, whether with resentment or fright, it was difficult to tell.\r\n\"And I didn't do anything last night, that I am ashamed to own.\"\r\n\r\n\"No impudence!\" exclaim'd the teacher, passionately, as he grasp'd a\r\nlong and heavy ratan: \"give me none of your sharp speeches, or I'll\r\nthrash you till you beg like a dog.\"\r\n\r\nThe youngster's face paled a little; his lip quiver'd, but he did not\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n\"And pray, sir,\" continued Lugare, as the outward signs of wrath\r\ndisappear'd from his features; \"what were you about the garden for?\r\nPerhaps you only receiv'd the plunder, and had an accomplice to do the\r\nmore dangerous part of the job?\"\r\n\r\n\"I went that way because it is on my road home. I was there again\r\nafterwards to meet an acquaintance; and--and--But I did not go into the\r\ngarden, nor take anything away from it. I would not steal,--hardly to\r\nsave myself from starving.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had better have stuck to that last evening. You were seen, Tim\r\nBarker, to come from under Mr. Nichols's garden-fence, a little after\r\nnine o'clock, with a bag full of something or other over your shoulders.\r\nThe bag had every appearance of being filled with fruit, and this\r\nmorning the melon-beds are found to have been completely clear'd. Now,\r\nsir, what was there in that bag?\"\r\n\r\nLike fire itself glow'd the face of the detected lad. He spoke not a\r\nword. All the school had their eyes directed at him. The perspiration\r\nran down his white forehead like rain-drops.\r\n\r\n\"Speak, sir!\" exclaimed Lugare, with a loud strike of his ratan on the\r\ndesk.\r\n\r\nThe boy look'd as though he would faint. But the unmerciful teacher,\r\nconfident of having brought to light a criminal, and exulting in\r\nthe idea of the severe chastisement he should now be justified in\r\ninflicting, kept working himself up to a still greater and greater\r\ndegree of passion. In the meantime, the child seem'd hardly to know what\r\nto do with himself. His tongue cleav'd to the roof of his mouth. Either\r\nhe was very much frighten'd, or he was actually unwell.\r\n\r\n\"Speak, I say!\" again thunder'd Lugare; and his hand, grasping his\r\nratan, tower'd above his head in a very significant manner.\r\n\r\n\"I hardly can, sir,\" said the poor fellow faintly. His voice was husky\r\nand thick. \"I will tell you some--some other time. Please let me go to\r\nmy seat--I a'n't well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes; that's very likely;\" and Mr. Lugare bulged out his nose and\r\ncheeks with contempt. \"Do you think to make me believe your lies? I've\r\nfound you out, sir, plainly enough; and I am satisfied that you are as\r\nprecious a little villain as there is in the State. But I will postpone\r\nsettling with you for an hour yet. I shall then call you up again;\r\nand if you don't tell the whole truth then, I will give you something\r\nthat'll make you remember Mr. Nichols's melons for many a month to\r\ncome:--go to your seat.\"\r\n\r\nGlad enough of the ungracious permission, and answering not a sound,\r\nthe child crept tremblingly to his bench. He felt very strangely,\r\ndizzily--more as if he was in a dream than in real life; and laying his\r\narms on his desk, bow'd down his face between them. The pupils turn'd\r\nto their accustom'd studies, for during the reign of Lugare in the\r\nvillage-school, they had been so used to scenes of violence and severe\r\nchastisement, that such things made but little interruption in the tenor\r\nof their way.\r\n\r\nNow, while the intervening hour is passing, we will clear up the mystery\r\nof the bag, and of young Barker being under the garden fence on the\r\npreceding night. The boy's mother was a widow, and they both had to live\r\nin the very narrowest limits. His father had died when he was six years\r\nold, and little Tim was left a sickly emaciated infant whom no one\r\nexpected to live many months. To the surprise of all, however, the poor\r\nchild kept alive, and seem'd to recover his health, as he certainly\r\ndid his size and good looks. This was owing to the kind offices of an\r\neminent physician who had a country-seat in the neighborhood, and who\r\nhad been interested in the widow's little family. Tim, the physician\r\nsaid, might possibly outgrow his disease; but everything was uncertain.\r\nIt was a mysterious and baffling malady; and it would not be wonderful\r\nif he should in some moment of apparent health be suddenly taken away.\r\nThe poor widow was at first in a continual state of uneasiness; but\r\nseveral years had now pass'd, and none of the impending evils had fallen\r\nupon the boy's head. His mother seem'd to feel confident that he would\r\nlive, and be a help and an honor to her old age; and the two struggled\r\non together, mutually happy in each other, and enduring much of poverty\r\nand discomfort without repining, each for the other's sake.\r\n\r\nTim's pleasant disposition had made him many friends in the village, and\r\namong the rest a young fanner named Jones, who, with his elder brother,\r\nwork'd a large farm in the neighborhood on shares. Jones very frequently\r\nmade Tim a present of a bag of potatoes or corn, or some garden\r\nvegetables, which he took from his own stock; but as his partner was a\r\nparsimonious, high-tempered man, and had often said that Tim was an\r\nidle fellow, and ought not to be help'd because he did not work, Jones\r\ngenerally made his gifts in such a manner that no one knew anything\r\nabout them, except himself and the grateful objects of his kindness.\r\nIt might be, too, that the widow was both to have it understood by the\r\nneighbors that she received food from anyone; for there is often an\r\nexcusable pride in people of her condition which makes them shrink from\r\nbeing consider'd as objects of \"charity\" as they would from the severest\r\npains. On the night in question, Tim had been told that Jones would send\r\nthem a bag of potatoes, and the place at which they were to be waiting\r\nfor him was fixed at Mr. Nichols's garden-fence. It was this bag that\r\nTim had been seen staggering under, and which caused the unlucky boy to\r\nbe accused and convicted by his teacher as a thief. That teacher was one\r\nlittle fitted for his important and responsible office. Hasty to decide,\r\nand inflexibly severe, he was the terror of the little world he ruled\r\nso despotically. Punishment he seemed to delight in. Knowing little of\r\nthose sweet fountains which in children's breasts ever open quickly\r\nat the call of gentleness and kind words, he was fear'd by all for his\r\nsternness, and loved by none. I would that he were an isolated instance\r\nin his profession.\r\n\r\nThe hour of grace had drawn to its close, and the time approach'd at\r\nwhich it was usual for Lugare to give his school a joyfully-receiv'd\r\ndismission. Now and then one of the scholars would direct a furtive\r\nglance at Tim, sometimes in pity, sometimes in indifference or inquiry.\r\nThey knew that he would have no mercy shown him, and though most of them\r\nloved him, whipping was too common there to exact much sympathy. Every\r\ninquiring glance, however, remain'd unsatisfied, for at the end of the\r\nhour, Tim remain'd with his face completely hidden, and his head bow'd\r\nin his arms, precisely as he had lean'd himself when he first went\r\nto his seat. Lugare look'd at the boy occasionally with a scowl which\r\nseem'd to bode vengeance for his sullenness. At length the last class\r\nhad been heard, and the last lesson recited, and Lugare seated himself\r\nbehind his desk on the platform, with his longest and stoutest ratan\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Barker,\" he said, \"we'll settle that little business of yours.\r\nJust step up here.\"\r\n\r\nTim did not move. The school-room was as still as the grave. Not a sound\r\nwas to be heard, except occasionally a long-drawn breath.\r\n\r\n\"Mind me, sir, or it will be the worse for you. Step up here, and take\r\noff your jacket!\"\r\n\r\nThe boy did not stir any more than if he had been of wood. Lugare shook\r\nwith passion. He sat still a minute, as if considering the best way to\r\nwreak his vengeance. That minute, passed in death-like silence, was\r\na fearful one to some of the children, for their faces whiten'd with\r\nfright. It seem'd, as it slowly dropp'd away, like the minute which\r\nprecedes the climax of an exquisitely-performed tragedy, when some\r\nmighty master of the histrionic art is treading the stage, and you\r\nand the multitude around you are waiting, with stretch'd nerves and\r\nsuspended breath, in expectation of the terrible catastrophe.\r\n\r\n\"Tim is asleep, sir,\" at length said one of the boys who sat near him.\r\nLugare, at this intelligence, allow'd his features to relax from their\r\nexpression of savage anger into a smile, but that smile look'd more\r\nmalignant if possible, than his former scowls. It might be that he felt\r\namused at the horror depicted on the faces of those about him; or\r\nit might be that he was gloating in pleasure on the way in which he\r\nintended to wake the slumberer.\r\n\r\n\"Asleep! are you, my young gentleman!\" said he; \"let us see if we can't\r\nfind something to tickle your eyes open. There's nothing like making the\r\nbest of a bad case, boys. Tim, here, is determin'd not to be worried in\r\nhis mind about a little flogging, for the thought of it can't even keep\r\nthe little scoundrel awake.\"\r\n\r\nLugare smiled again as he made the last observation. He grasp'd his\r\nratan firmly, and descended from his seat. With light and stealthy steps\r\nhe cross'd the room and stood by the unlucky sleeper. The boy was still\r\nas unconscious of his impending punishment as ever. He might be dreaming\r\nsome golden dream of youth and pleasure; perhaps he was far away in the\r\nworld of fancy, seeing scenes, and feeling delights, which cold reality\r\nnever can bestow. Lugare lifted his ratan high over his head, and with\r\nthe true and expert aim which he had acquired by long practice, brought\r\nit down on Tim's back with a force and whacking sound which seem'd\r\nsufficient to wake a freezing man in his last lethargy. Quick and fast,\r\nblow foliow'd blow. Without waiting to see the effect of the first cut,\r\nthe brutal wretch plied his instrument of torture first on one side of\r\nthe boy's back, and then on the other, and only stopped at the end of\r\ntwo or three minutes from very weariness. But still Tim show'd no signs\r\nof motion; and as Lugare, provoked at his torpidity, jerk'd away one of\r\nthe child's arms, on which he had been leaning over the desk, his head\r\ndropp'd down on the board with a dull sound, and his face lay turn'd up\r\nand exposed to view. When Lugare saw it, he stood like one transfix'd\r\nby a basilisk. His countenance turn'd to a leaden whiteness; the ratan\r\ndropp'd from his grasp; and his eyes, stretch'd wide open, glared as at\r\nsome monstrous spectacle of horror and death. The sweat started in\r\ngreat globules seemingly from every pore in his face; his skinny lips\r\ncontracted, and show'd his teeth; and when he at length stretch'd forth\r\nhis arm, and with the end of one of his fingers touch'd the child's\r\ncheek, each limb quiver'd like the tongue of a snake; and his strength\r\nseemed as though it would momentarily fail him. The boy was dead. He\r\nhad probably been so for some time, for his eyes were turn'd up, and his\r\nbody was quite cold. Death was in the school-room, and Lugare had been\r\nflogging A CORPSE.\r\n\r\n-_Democratic Review, August, 1841._\r\n\r\n\r\nONE WICKED IMPULSE\r\n\r\nThat section of Nassau street which runs into the great mart of New York\r\nbrokers and stock-jobbers, has for a long time been much occupied by\r\npractitioners of the law. Tolerably well-known amid this class some\r\nyears since, was Adam Covert, a middle-aged man of rather limited means,\r\nwho, to tell the truth, gained more by trickery than he did in the\r\nlegitimate and honorable exercise of his profession. He was a tall,\r\nbilious-faced widower; the father of two children; and had lately been\r\nseeking to better his fortunes by a rich marriage. But somehow or other\r\nhis wooing did not seem to thrive well, and, with perhaps one exception,\r\nthe lawyer's prospects in the matrimonial way were hopelessly gloomy.\r\n\r\nAmong the early clients of Mr. Covert had been a distant relative named\r\nMarsh, who, dying somewhat suddenly, left his son and daughter, and some\r\nlittle property, to the care of Covert, under a will drawn out by that\r\ngentleman himself. At no time caught without his eyes open, the cunning\r\nlawyer, aided by much sad confusion in the emergency which had caused\r\nhis services to be called for, and disguising his object under a cloud\r\nof technicalities, inserted provisions in the will, giving himself an\r\nalmost arbitrary control over the property and over those for whom it\r\nwas designed. This control was even made to extend beyond the time when\r\nthe children would arrive at mature age. The son, Philip, a spirited and\r\nhigh-temper'd fellow, had some time since pass'd that age. Esther,\r\nthe girl, a plain, and somewhat devotional young woman, was in her\r\nnineteenth year.\r\n\r\nHaving such power over his wards, Covert did not scruple openly to use\r\nhis advantage, in pressing his claims as a suitor for Esther's hand.\r\nSince the death of Marsh, the property he left, which had been in real\r\nestate, and was to be divided equally between the brother and sister,\r\nhad risen to very considerable value; and Esther's share was to a man in\r\nCovert's situation a prize very well worth seeking. All this time, while\r\nreally owning a respectable income, the young orphans often felt the\r\nwant of the smallest sum of money--and Esther, on Philip's account, was\r\nmore than once driven to various contrivances--the pawn-shop, sales of\r\nher own little luxuries, and the like, to furnish him with means.\r\n\r\nThough she had frequently shown her guardian unequivocal evidence of her\r\naversion, Esther continued to suffer from his persecutions, until one\r\nday he proceeded farther and was more pressing than usual. She possess'd\r\nsome of her brother's mettlesome temper, and gave him an abrupt and most\r\ndecided refusal. With dignity, she exposed the baseness of his conduct,\r\nand forbade him ever again mentioning marriage to her. He retorted\r\nbitterly, vaunted his hold on her and Philip, and swore an oath that\r\nunless she became his wife, they should both thenceforward become\r\npenniless. Losing his habitual self-control in his exasperation, he even\r\nadded insults such as woman never receives from any one deserving the\r\nname of man, and at his own convenience left the house. That day, Philip\r\nreturn'd to New York, after an absence of several weeks on the business\r\nof a mercantile house in whose employment he had lately engaged.\r\n\r\nToward the latter part of the same afternoon, Mr. Covert was sitting in\r\nhis office, in Nassau street, busily at work, when a knock at the door\r\nannounc'd a visitor, and directly afterward young Marsh enter'd the\r\nroom. His face exhibited a peculiar pallid appearance that did not\r\nstrike Covert at all agreeably, and he call'd his clerk from an\r\nadjoining room, and gave him something to do at a desk near by.\r\n\r\n\"I wish to see you alone, Mr. Covert, if convenient,\" said the newcomer.\r\n\r\n\"We can talk quite well enough where we are,\" answer'd the lawyer;\r\n\"indeed, I don't know that I have any leisure to talk at all, for just\r\nnow I am very much press'd with business.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I _must_ speak to you,\" rejoined Philip sternly, \"at least I must\r\nsay one thing, and that is, Mr. Covert, that you are a villain!\"\r\n\r\n\"Insolent!\" exclaimed the lawyer, rising behind the table, and pointing\r\nto the door. \"Do you see that, sir? Let one minute longer find you\r\nthe other side, or your feet may reach the landing by quicker method.\r\nBegone, sir!\"\r\n\r\nSuch a threat was the more harsh to Philip, for he had rather\r\nhigh-strung feelings of honor. He grew almost livid with suppress'd\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\n\"I will see you again very soon,\" said he, in a low but distinct manner,\r\nhis lips trembling as he spoke; and left the office.\r\n\r\nThe incidents of the rest of that pleasant summer day left little\r\nimpression on the young man's mind. He roam'd to and fro without any\r\nobject or destination. Along South street and by Whitehall, he watch'd\r\nwith curious eyes the movements of the shipping, and the loading and\r\nunloading of cargoes; and listen'd to the merry heave-yo of the sailors\r\nand stevedores. There are some minds upon which great excitement\r\nproduces the singular effect of uniting two utterly inconsistent\r\nfaculties--a sort of cold apathy, and a sharp sensitiveness to all that\r\nis going on at the same time. Philip's was one of this sort; he\r\nnoticed the various differences in the apparel of a gang of\r\nwharf-laborers--turn'd over in his brain whether they receiv'd wages\r\nenough to keep them comfortable, and their families also--and if they\r\nhad families or not, which he tried to tell by their looks. In such\r\npetty reflections the daylight passed away. And all the while the master\r\nwish of Philip's thoughts was a desire to see the lawyer Covert. For\r\nwhat purpose he himself was by no means clear.\r\n\r\nNightfall came at last. Still, however, the young man did not direct\r\nhis steps homeward. He felt more calm, however, and entering an eating\r\nhouse, order'd something for his supper, which, when it was brought to\r\nhim, he merely tasted, and stroll'd forth again. There was a kind of\r\ngnawing sensation of thirst within him yet, and as he pass'd a hotel, he\r\nbethought him that one little glass of spirits would perhaps be just the\r\nthing. He drank, and hour after hour wore away unconsciously; he drank\r\nnot one glass, but three or four, and strong glasses they were to him,\r\nfor he was habitually abstemious.\r\n\r\nIt had been a hot day and evening, and when Philip, at an advanced\r\nperiod of the night, emerged from the bar-room into the street, he\r\nfound that a thunderstorm had just commenced. He resolutely walk'd on,\r\nhowever, although at every step it grew more and more blustering.\r\n\r\nThe rain now pour'd down a cataract; the shops were all shut; few of\r\nthe street lamps were lighted; and there was little except the frequent\r\nflashes of lightning to show him his way. When about half the length of\r\nChatham street, which lay in the direction he had to take, the momentary\r\nfury of the tempest forced him to turn aside into a sort of shelter\r\nform'd by the corners of the deep entrance to a Jew pawnbroker's shop\r\nthere. He had hardly drawn himself in as closely as possible, when\r\nthe lightning revealed to him that the opposite corner of the nook was\r\ntenanted also.\r\n\r\n\"A sharp rain, this,\" said the other occupant, who simultaneously beheld\r\nPhilip.\r\n\r\nThe voice sounded to the young man's ears a note which almost made him\r\nsober again. It was certainly the voice of Adam Covert. He made some\r\ncommonplace reply, and waited for another flash of lightning to show him\r\nthe stranger's face. It came, and he saw that his companion was indeed\r\nhis guardian.\r\n\r\nPhilip Marsh had drank deeply--(let us plead all that may be possible\r\nto you, stern moralist.) Upon his mind came swarming, and he could not\r\ndrive them away, thoughts of all those insults his sister had told him\r\nof, and the bitter words Covert had spoken to her; he reflected, too,\r\non the injuries Esther as well as himself had receiv'd, and were\r\nstill likely to receive, at the hands of that bold, bad man; how\r\nmean, selfish, and unprincipled was his character--what base and cruel\r\nadvantages he had taken of many poor people, entangled in his power,\r\nand of how much wrong and suffering he had been the author, and might be\r\nagain through future years. The very turmoil of the elements, the harsh\r\nroll of the thunder, the vindictive beating of the rain, and the fierce\r\nglare of the wild fluid that seem'd to riot in the ferocity of the storm\r\naround him, kindled a strange sympathetic fury in the young man's mind.\r\nHeaven itself (so deranged were his imaginations) appear'd to have\r\nprovided a fitting scene and time for a deed of retribution, which to\r\nhis disorder'd passion half wore the semblance of a divine justice. He\r\nremember'd not the ready solution to be found in Covert's pressure of\r\nbusiness, which had no doubt kept him later than usual; but fancied some\r\nmysterious intent in the ordaining that he should be there, and that\r\nthey two should meet at that untimely hour. All this whirl of influence\r\ncame over Philip with startling quickness at that horrid moment. He\r\nstepp'd to the side of his guardian.\r\n\r\n\"Ho!\" said he, \"have we met so soon, Mr. Covert? You traitor to my dead\r\nfather--robber of his children! I fear to think on what I think now!\"\r\n\r\nThe lawyer's natural effrontery did not desert him.\r\n\r\n\"Unless you'd like to spend a night in the watch-house, young\r\ngentleman,\" said he, after a short pause, \"move on. Your father was a\r\nweak man, I remember; as for his son, his own wicked heart is his worst\r\nfoe. I have never done wrong to either--that I can say, and swear it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Insolent liar!\" exclaimed Philip, his eye flashing out sparks of fire\r\nin the darkness.\r\n\r\nCovert made no reply except a cool, contemptuous laugh, which stung\r\nthe excited young man to double fury. He sprang upon the lawyer, and\r\nclutch'd him by the neckcloth.\r\n\r\n\"Take it, then!\" he cried hoarsely, for his throat was impeded by the\r\nfiendish rage which in that black hour possess'd him. \"You are not fit\r\nto live!\"\r\n\r\nHe dragg'd his guardian to the earth and fell crushingly upon him,\r\nchoking the shriek the poor victim but just began to utter. Then, with\r\nmonstrous imprecations, he twisted a tight knot around the gasping\r\ncreature's neck, drew a clasp knife from his pocket, and touching the\r\nspring, the long sharp blade, too eager for its bloody work, flew open.\r\n\r\nDuring the lull of the storm, the last strength of the prostrate man\r\nburst forth into one short loud cry of agony. At the same instant, the\r\narm of the murderer thrust the blade, once, twice, thrice, deep in his\r\nenemy's bosom! Not a minute had passed since that fatal exasperating\r\nlaugh--but the deed was done, and the instinctive thought which came at\r\nonce to the guilty one, was a thought of fear and escape.\r\n\r\nIn the unearthly pause which follow'd, Philip's eyes gave one long\r\nsearching sweep in every direction, above and around him. _Above_! God\r\nof the all-seeing eye! What, and who was that figure there?\r\n\r\n\"Forbear! In Jehovah's name forbear;\" cried a shrill, but clear and\r\nmelodious voice.\r\n\r\nIt was as if some accusing spirit had come down to bear witness against\r\nthe deed of blood. Leaning far out of an open window, appear' d a white\r\ndraperied shape, its face possess'd of a wonderful youthful beauty.\r\nLong vivid glows of lightning gave Philip a full opportunity to see as\r\nclearly as though the sun had been shining at noonday. One hand of the\r\nfigure was raised upward in a deprecating attitude, and his large bright\r\nblack eyes bent down upon the scene below with an expression of horror\r\nand shrinking pain. Such heavenly looks, and the peculiar circumstance\r\nof the time, fill'd Philip's heart with awe.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if it is not yet too late,\" spoke the youth again, \"spare him. In\r\nGod's voice, I command, 'Thou shalt do no murder!'\"\r\n\r\nThe words rang like a knell in the ear of the terror-stricken and\r\nalready remorseful Philip. Springing from the body, he gave a second\r\nglance up and down the walk, which was totally lonesome and deserted;\r\nthen crossing into Reade street, he made his fearful way in a half state\r\nof stupor, half-bewilderment, by the nearest avenues to his home.\r\n\r\nWhen the corpse of the murder'd lawyer was found in the morning, and the\r\nofficers of justice commenced their inquiry, suspicion immediately fell\r\nupon Philip, and he was arrested. The most rigorous search, however,\r\nbrought to light nothing at all implicating the young man, except his\r\nvisit to Covert's office the evening before, and his angry language\r\nthere. That was by no means enough to fix so heavy a charge upon him.\r\n\r\nThe second day afterward, the whole business came before the ordinary\r\njudicial tribunal, in order that Philip might be either committed for\r\nthe crime, or discharged. The testimony of Mr. Covert's clerk stood\r\nalone. One of his employers, who, believing in his innocence, had\r\ndeserted him not in this crisis, had provided him with the ablest\r\ncriminal counsel in New York. The proof was declared entirely\r\ninsufficient, and Philip was discharged.\r\n\r\nThe crowded court-room made way for him as he came out; hundreds of\r\ncurious looks fixed upon his features, and many a jibe pass'd upon him.\r\nBut of all that arena of human faces, he saw only _one_--a sad, pale,\r\nblack-eyed one, cowering in the centre of the rest. He had seen that\r\nface twice before--the first time as a warning spectre--the second time\r\nin prison, immediately after his arrest--now for the _last_ time. This\r\nyoung stranger--the son of a scorn'd race--coming to the court-room to\r\nperform an unhappy duty, with the intention of testifying to what he\r\nhad seen, melted at the sight of Philip's bloodless cheek, and of his\r\nsister's convulsive sobs, and forbore witnessing against the murderer.\r\nShall we applaud or condemn him? Let every reader answer the question\r\nfor himself.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Philip left New York. His friendly employer own'd a small\r\nfarm some miles up the Hudson, and until the excitement of the affair\r\nwas over, he advised the young man to go thither. Philip thankfully\r\naccepted the proposal, made a few preparations, took a hurried leave of\r\nEsther, and by nightfall was settled in his new abode.\r\n\r\nAnd how, think you, rested Philip Marsh that night? _Rested_ indeed! O,\r\nif those who clamor so much for the halter and the scaffold to punish\r\ncrime, could have seen that sight, they might have learn'd a lesson\r\nthen! Four days had elapsed since he that lay tossing upon the bed there\r\nhad slumber'd. Not the slightest intermission had come to his awaken'd\r\nand tensely strung sense, during those frightful days. Disturb'd waking\r\ndreams came to him, as he thought what he might do to gain his lost\r\npeace. Far, far away would he go! The cold roll of the murder'd\r\nman's eye, as it turn'd up its last glance into his face--the shrill\r\nexclamation of pain--all the unearthly vividness of the posture,\r\nmotions, and looks of the dead--the warning voice from above--pursued\r\nhim like tormenting furies, and were never absent from his mind, asleep\r\nor awake, that long weary night. Anything, any place, to escape such\r\nhorrid companionship! He would travel inland--hire himself to do hard\r\ndrudgery upon some farm--work incessantly through the wide summer days,\r\nand thus force nature to bestow oblivion upon his senses, at least a\r\nlittle while now and then. He would fly on, on, on, until amid different\r\nscenes and a new life, the old memories were rubb'd entirely out. He\r\nwould fight bravely in himself for peace of mind. For peace he would\r\nlabor and struggle--for peace he would pray!\r\n\r\nAt length after a feverish slumber of some thirty or forty minutes, the\r\nunhappy youth, waking with a nervous start, rais'd himself in bed, and\r\nsaw the blessed daylight beginning to dawn. He felt the sweat trickling\r\ndown his naked breast; the sheet where he had lain was quite wet with\r\nit. Dragging himself wearily, he open'd the window. Ah! that good\r\nmorning air--how it refresh'd him--how he lean'd out, and drank in the\r\nfragrance of the blossoms below, and almost for the first time in his\r\nlife felt how beautifully indeed God had made the earth, and that there\r\nwas wonderful sweetness in mere existence. And amidst the thousand mute\r\nmouths and eloquent eyes, which appear'd as it were to look up and speak\r\nin every direction, he fancied so many invitations to come among them.\r\n\r\nNot without effort, for he was very weak, he dress'd himself, and issued\r\nforth into the open air.\r\n\r\nClouds of pale gold and transparent crimson draperied the eastern sky,\r\nbut the sun, whose face gladden'd them into all that glory, was not yet\r\nabove the horizon. It was a time and place of such rare, such Eden-like\r\nbeauty! Philip paused at the summit of an upward slope, and gazed around\r\nhim. Some few miles off he could see a gleam of the Hudson river, and\r\nabove it a spur of those rugged cliffs scatter'd along its western\r\nshores. Nearer by were cultivated fields. The clover grew richly there,\r\nthe young grain bent to the early breeze, and the air was filled with an\r\nintoxicating perfume. At his side was the large well-kept garden of his\r\nhost, in which were many pretty flowers, grass plots, and a wide avenue\r\nof noble trees. As Philip gazed, the holy calming power of Nature--the\r\ninvisible spirit of so much beauty and so much innocence, melted into\r\nhis soul. The disturb'd passions and the feverish conflict subsided. He\r\neven felt something like envied peace of mind--a sort of joy even in\r\nthe presence of all the unmarr'd goodness. It was as fair to him, guilty\r\nthough he had been, as to the purest of the pure. No accusing frowns\r\nshow'd in the face of the flowers, or in the green shrubs, or\r\nthe branches of the trees. They, more forgiving than mankind, and\r\ndistinguishing not between the children of darkness and the children of\r\nlight--they at least treated him with gentleness. Was he, then, a being\r\nso accurs'd? Involuntarily, he bent over a branch of red roses, and took\r\nthem softly between his hands--those murderous, bloody hands! But the\r\nred roses neither wither'd nor smell'd less fragiant. And as the young\r\nman kiss'd them, and dropp'd a tear upon them, it seem'd to him that he\r\nhad found pity and sympathy from Heaven itself.\r\n\r\nThough against all the rules of story-writing, we continue our narrative\r\nof these mainly true incidents (for such they are,) no further. Only to\r\nsay that _the murderer_ soon departed for a new field of action--that\r\nhe is still living--and that this is but one of thousands of cases of\r\nunravel'd, unpunish'd crime--left, not to the tribunals of man, but to a\r\nwider power and judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAST LOYALIST\r\n\r\n[\"_She came to me last night, The floor gave back no tread_.\"] The story\r\nI am going to tell is a traditional reminiscence of a country place, in\r\nmy rambles about which I have often passed the house, now unoccupied,\r\nand mostly in ruins, that was the scene of the transaction. I cannot,\r\nof course, convey to others that particular kind of influence which is\r\nderived from my being so familiar with the locality, and with the very\r\npeople whose grandfathers or fathers were contemporaries of the actors\r\nin the drama I shall transcribe. I must hardly expect, therefore, that\r\nto those who hear it thro' the medium of my pen, the narration will\r\npossess as life-like and interesting a character as it does to myself.\r\n\r\nOn a large and fertile neck of land that juts out in the Sound,\r\nstretching to the east of New York city, there stood, in the latter part\r\nof the last century, an old-fashion'd country-residence. It had been\r\nbuilt by one of the first settlers of this section of the New World; and\r\nits occupant was originally owner of the extensive tract lying adjacent\r\nto his house, and pushing into the bosom of the salt waters. It was\r\nduring the troubled times which mark'd our American Revolution that\r\nthe incidents occurr'd which are the foundation of my story. Some\r\ntime before the commencement of the war, the owner, whom I shall call\r\nVanhome, was taken sick and died. For some time before his death he had\r\nlived a widower; and his only child, a lad of ten years old, was thus\r\nleft an orphan. By his father's will this child was placed implicitly\r\nunder the guardianship of an uncle, a middle-aged man, who had been\r\nof late a resident in the family. His care and interest, however, were\r\nneeded but a little while--not two years claps'd after the parents were\r\nlaid away to their last repose before another grave had to be prepared\r\nfor the son--the child who had been so haplessly deprived of their\r\nfostering care.\r\n\r\nThe period now arrived when the great national convulsion burst\r\nforth. Sounds of strife and the clash of arms, and the angry voices of\r\ndisputants, were borne along by the air, and week after week grew to\r\nstill louder clamor. Families were divided; adherents to the crown, and\r\nardent upholders of the rebellion, were often found in the bosom of the\r\nsame domestic circle. Vanhome, the uncle spoken of as guardian to the\r\nyoung heir, was a man who lean'd to the stern, the high-handed and the\r\nsevere. He soon became known among the most energetic of the loyalists.\r\nSo decided were his sentiments that, leaving the estate which he had\r\ninherited from his brother and nephew, he join'd the forces of the\r\nBritish king. Thenceforward, whenever his old neighbors heard of him, it\r\nwas as being engaged in the cruelest outrages, the boldest inroads, or\r\nthe most determin'd attacks upon the army of his countrymen or their\r\npeaceful settlements. Eight years brought the rebel States and their\r\nleaders to that glorious epoch when the last remnant of a monarch's rule\r\nwas to leave their shores--when the last waving of the royal standard\r\nwas to flutter as it should be haul'd down from the staff, and its place\r\nfill'd by the proud testimonial of our warriors' success.\r\n\r\nPleasantly over the autumn fields shone the November sun, when a\r\nhorseman, of somewhat military look, plodded slowly along the road that\r\nled to the old Vanhome farmhouse. There was nothing peculiar in his\r\nattire, unless it might be a red scarf which he wore tied round his\r\nwaist. He was a dark-featured, sullen-eyed man; and as his glance was\r\nthrown restlessly to the right and left, his whole manner appear'd to\r\nbe that of a person moving amid familiar and accustom'd scenes.\r\nOccasionally he stopp'd, and looking long and steadily at some object\r\nthat attracted his attention, mutter'd to himself, like one in whose\r\nbreast busy thoughts were moving. His course was evidently to the\r\nhomestead itself, at which in due time he arrived. He dismounted, led\r\nhis horse to the stables, and then, without knocking, though there were\r\nevident signs of occupancy around the building, the traveler made his\r\nentrance as composedly and boldly as though he were master of the whole\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nNow the house being in a measure deserted for many years, and the\r\nsuccessful termination of the strife rendering it probable that the\r\nVanhome estate would be confiscated to the new government, an aged,\r\npoverty-stricken couple had been encouraged by the neighbors to take\r\npossession as tenants of the place. Their name was Gills; and these\r\npeople the traveler found upon his entrance were likely to be his host\r\nand hostess. Holding their right as they did by so slight a tenure,\r\nthey ventur'd to offer no opposition when the stranger signified his\r\nintention of passing several hours there.\r\n\r\nThe day wore on, and the sun went down in the west; still the\r\ninterloper, gloomy and taciturn, made no signs of departing. But as\r\nthe evening advanced (whether the darkness was congenial to his sombre\r\nthoughts, or whether it merely chanced so) he seem'd to grow more\r\naffable and communicative, and informed Gills that he should pass the\r\nnight there, tendering him at the same time ample remuneration, which\r\nthe latter accepted with many thanks.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" said he to his aged host, when they were all sitting around\r\nthe ample hearth, at the conclusion of their evening meal, \"tell me\r\nsomething to while away the hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! sir,\" answered Gills, \"this is no place for new or interesting\r\nevents. We live here from year to year, and at the end of one we find\r\nourselves at about the same place which we filled in the beginning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you relate nothing, then?\" rejoin'd the guest, and a singular\r\nsmile pass'd over his features; \"can you say nothing about your own\r\nplace?--this house or its former inhabitants, or former history?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man glanced across to his wife, and a look expressive of\r\nsympathetic feeling started in the face of each.\r\n\r\n\"It is an unfortunate story, sir,\" said Gills, \"and may cast a chill\r\nupon you, instead of the pleasant feeling which it would be best to\r\nfoster when in strange walls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange walls!\" echoed he of the red scarf, and for the first time\r\nsince his arrival he half laughed, but it was not the laugh which comes\r\nfrom a man's heart.\r\n\r\n\"You must know, sir,\" continued Gills, \"I am myself a sort of intruder\r\nhere. The Vanhomes--that was the name of the former residents and\r\nowners--I have never seen; for when I came to these parts the last\r\noccupant had left to join the red-coat soldiery. I am told that he is\r\nto sail with them for foreign lands, now that the war is ended, and his\r\nproperty almost certain to pass into other hands.\"\r\n\r\nAs the old man went on, the stranger cast down his eyes, and listen'd\r\nwith an appearance of great interest, though a transient smile or a\r\nbrightening of the eye would occasionally disturb the serenity of his\r\ndeportment.\r\n\r\n\"The old owners of this place,\" continued the white-haired narrator,\r\n\"were well off in the world, and bore a good name among their neighbors.\r\nThe brother of Sergeant Vanhome, now the only one of the name, died ten\r\nor twelve years since, leaving a son--a child so small that the father's\r\nwillmade provision for his being brought up by his uncle, whom I\r\nmention'd but now as of the British army. He was a strange man, this\r\nuncle; disliked by all who knew him; passionate, vindictive, and, it was\r\nsaid, very avaricious, even from his childhood.\r\n\r\n\"Well, not long after the death of the parents, dark stories began to\r\nbe circulated about cruelty and punishment and whippings and starvation\r\ninflicted by the new master upon his nephew. People who had business\r\nat the homestead would frequently, when they came away, relate the most\r\nfearful things of its manager, and how he misused his brother's child.\r\nIt was half hinted that he strove to get the youngster out of the way in\r\norder that the whole estate might fall into his own hands. As I told you\r\nbefore, however, nobody liked the man; and perhaps they judged him too\r\nuncharitably.\r\n\r\n\"After things had gone on in this way for some time, a countryman,\r\na laborer, who was hired to do farm-work upon the place, one evening\r\nobserved that the little orphan Vanhome was more faint and pale even\r\nthan usual, for he was always delicate, and that is one reason why I\r\nthink it possible that his death, of which I am now going to tell you,\r\nwas but the result of his own weak constitution, and nothing else. The\r\nlaborer slept that night at the farmhouse. Just before the time at which\r\nthey usually retired to bed, this person, feeling sleepy with his day's\r\ntoil, left the kitchen hearth and wended his way to rest. In going to\r\nhis place of repose he had to pass a chamber--the very chamber where\r\nyou, sir, are to sleep to-night--and there he heard the voice of the\r\norphan child uttering half-suppress'd exclamations as if in pitiful\r\nentreaty. Upon stopping, he heard also the tones of the elder Vanhome,\r\nbut they were harsh and bitter. The sound of blows followed. As each one\r\nfell it was accompanied by a groan or shriek, and so they continued for\r\nsome time. Shock'd and indignant, the countryman would have burst\r\nopen the door and interfered to prevent this brutal proceeding, but he\r\nbethought him that he might get himself into trouble, and perhaps find\r\nthat he could do no good after all, and so he passed on to his room.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, the following day the child did not come out among the\r\nwork-people as usual. He was taken very ill. No physician was sent for\r\nuntil the next afternoon; and though one arrived in the course of the\r\nnight, it was too late--the poor boy died before morning.\r\n\r\n\"People talk'd threateningly upon the subject, but nothing could be\r\nproved against Vanhome. At one period there were efforts made to have\r\nthe whole affair investigated. Perhaps that would have taken place, had\r\nnot every one's attention been swallow'd up by the rumors of difficulty\r\nand war, which were then beginning to disturb the country.\r\n\r\n\"Vanhome joined the army of the king. His enemies said that he feared to\r\nbe on the side of the rebels, because if they were routed his property\r\nwould be taken from him. But events have shown that, if this was indeed\r\nwhat he dreaded, it has happen'd to him from the very means which he\r\ntook to prevent it.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man paused. He had quite wearied himself with so long talking.\r\nFor some minutes there was unbroken silence. Presently the stranger\r\nsignified his intention of retiring for the night. He rose, and his host\r\ntook a light for the purpose of ushering him to his apartment.\r\n\r\nWhen Gills return'd to his accustom'd situation in the large arm-chair\r\nby the chimney-hearth, his ancient helpmate had retired to rest. With\r\nthe simplicity of their times, the bed stood in the same room where the\r\nthree had been seated during the last few hours; and now the remaining\r\ntwo talk'd together about the singular events of the evening. As the\r\ntime wore on, Gills show'd no disposition to leave his cosy chair;\r\nbut sat toasting his feet, and bending over the coals. Gradually the\r\ninsidious heat and the lateness of the hour began to exercise their\r\ninfluence over the old man. The drowsy indolent feeling which every one\r\nhas experienced in getting thoroughly heated through by close contact\r\nwith a glowing fire, spread in each vein and sinew, and relax'd its\r\ntone. He lean'd back in his chair and slept.\r\n\r\nFor a long time his repose went on quietly and soundly. He could not\r\ntell how many hours elapsed; but, a while after midnight, the torpid\r\nsenses of the slumberer were awaken'd by a startling shock. It was a\r\ncry as of a strong man in his agony--a shrill, not very loud cry, but\r\nfearful, and creeping into the blood like cold, polish'd steel. The old\r\nman raised himself in his seat and listen'd, at once fully awake. For a\r\nminute, all was the solemn stillness of midnight. Then rose that horrid\r\ntone again, wailing and wild, and making the hearer's hair to stand on\r\nend. One moment more, and the trampling of hasty feet sounded in the\r\npassage outside. The door was thrown open, and the form of the stranger,\r\nmore like a corpse than living man, rushed into the room.\r\n\r\n\"All white!\" yell'd the conscience-stricken creature--\"all white, and\r\nwith the grave-clothes around him. One shoulder was bare, and I saw,\"\r\nhe whisper'd, \"I saw blue streaks upon it. It was horrible, and I cried\r\naloud. He stepp'd toward me! He came to my very bedside; his small hand\r\nalmost touch'd my face. I could not bear it, and fled.\"\r\n\r\nThe miserable man bent his head down upon his bosom; convulsive\r\nrattlings shook his throat; and his whole frame waver'd to and fro\r\nlike a tree in a storm. Bewilder'd and shock'd, Gills look'd at his\r\napparently deranged guest, and knew not what answer to make, or what\r\ncourse of conduct to pursue.\r\n\r\nThrusting out his arms and his extended fingers, and bending down\r\nhis eyes, as men do when shading them from a glare of lightning, the\r\nstranger stagger'd from the door, and, in a moment further, dash'd madly\r\nthrough the passage which led through the kitchen into the outer road.\r\nThe old man heard the noise of his falling footsteps, sounding fainter\r\nand fainter in the distance, and then, retreating, dropp'd his own\r\nexhausted limbs into the chair from which he had been arous'd so\r\nterribly. It was many minutes before his energies recover'd their\r\naccustomed tone again. Strangely enough, his wife, unawaken'd by the\r\nstranger's ravings, still slumber'd on as profoundly as ever.\r\n\r\nPass we on to a far different scene--the embarkation of the British\r\ntroops for the distant land whose monarch was never more to wield the\r\nsceptre over a kingdom lost by his imprudence and tyranny. With frowning\r\nbrow and sullen pace the martial ranks moved on. Boat after boat was\r\nfilled, and, as each discharged its complement in the ships that lay\r\nheaving their anchors in the stream, it return'd, and was soon filled\r\nwith another load. And at length it became time for the last soldier\r\nto lift his eye and take a last glance at the broad banner of England's\r\npride, which flapp'd its folds from the top of the highest staff on the\r\nBattery.\r\n\r\nAs the warning sound of a trumpet called together all who were\r\nlaggards--those taking leave of friends, and those who were arranging\r\ntheir own private affairs, left until the last moment--a single\r\nhorseman was seen furiously dashing down the street. A red scarf tightly\r\nencircled his waist. He made directly for the shore, and the crowd\r\nthere gather'd started back in wonderment as they beheld his dishevel'd\r\nappearance and ghastly face. Throwing himself violently from his saddle,\r\nhe flung the bridle over the animal's neck, and gave him a sharp cut\r\nwith a small riding whip. He made for the boat; one minute later, and he\r\nhad been left. They were pushing the keel from the landing--the stranger\r\nsprang--a space of two or three feet already intervened--he struck on\r\nthe gunwale--and the Last Soldier of King George had left the American\r\nshores.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD FRANK'S RETURN\r\n\r\nAs the sun, one August day some fifty years ago, had just pass'd the\r\nmeridian of a country town in the eastern section of Long Island, a\r\nsingle traveler came up to the quaint low-roof'd village tavern, open'd\r\nits half-door, and enter'd the common room. Dust cover'd the clothes of\r\nthe wayfarer, and his brow was moist with sweat. He trod in a lagging,\r\nweary way; though his form and features told of an age not more than\r\nnineteen or twenty years. Over one shoulder was slung a sailor's jacket,\r\nand in his hand he carried a little bundle. Sitting down on a rude\r\nbench, he told a female who made her appearance behind the bar, that\r\nhe would have a glass of brandy and sugar. He took off the liquor at a\r\ndraught: after which he lit and began to smoke a cigar, with which he\r\nsupplied himself from his pocket--stretching out one leg, and leaning\r\nhis elbow down on the bench, in the attitude of a man who takes an\r\nindolent lounge.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know one Richard Hall that lives somewhere here among you?\" said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hall's is down the lane that turns off by that big locust tree,\"\r\nanswer'd the woman, pointing to the direction through the open door;\r\n\"it's about half a mile from here to his house.\"\r\n\r\nThe youth, for a minute or two, puff'd the smoke from his mouth very\r\nleisurely in silence. His manner had an air of vacant self-sufficiency,\r\nrather strange in one of so few years.\r\n\r\n\"I wish to see Mr. Hall,\" he said at length--\"Here's a silver six-pence,\r\nfor any one who will carry a message to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"The folks are all away. It's but a short walk, and your limbs are\r\nyoung,\" replied the female, who was not altogether pleased with the easy\r\nway of making himself at home which mark'd her shabby-looking customer.\r\nThat individual, however, seem'd to give small attention to the hint,\r\nbut lean'd and puff'd his cigar-smoke as leisurely as before.\r\n\r\n\"Unless,\" continued the woman, catching a second glance at the sixpence;\r\n\"unless old Joe is at the stable, as he's very likely to be. I'll go\r\nand find out for you.\" And she push'd open a door at her back, stepp'd\r\nthrough an adjoining room into a yard, whence her voice was the next\r\nmoment heard calling the person she had mention'd, in accents by no\r\nmeans remarkable for their melody or softness.\r\n\r\nHer search was successful. She soon return'd with him who was to act as\r\nmessenger--a little, wither'd, ragged old man--a hanger-on there,\r\nwhose unshaven face told plainly enough the story of his intemperate\r\nhabits--those deeply seated habits, now too late to be uprooted, that\r\nwould ere long lay him in a drunkard's grave. The youth inform'd him\r\nwhat the required service was, and promised him the reward as soon as he\r\nshould return,\r\n\r\n\"Tell Richard Hall that I am going to his father's house this afternoon.\r\nIf he asks who it is that wishes him here, say the person sent no name,\"\r\ncontinued the stranger, sitting up from his indolent posture, as the\r\nfeet of old Joe were about leaving the door-stone, and his blear'd eyes\r\nturned to eaten the last sentence of the mandate.\r\n\r\n\"And yet, perhaps you may as well,\" added he, communing a moment with\r\nhimself: \"you may tell him his brother Frank, Wild Frank, it is, who\r\nwishes him to come.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man departed on his errand, and he who call'd himself Wild\r\nFrank, toss'd his nearly smoked cigar out of the window, and folded his\r\narms in thought.\r\n\r\nNo better place than this, probably, will occur to give a brief account\r\nof some former events in the life of the young stranger, resting and\r\nwaiting at the village inn. Fifteen miles east of that inn lived a\r\nfarmer named Hall, a man of good repute, well-off in the world, and head\r\nof a large family. He was fond of gain--required all his boys to labor\r\nin proportion to their age; and his right hand man, if he might not\r\nbe called favorite, was his eldest son Richard. This eldest son, an\r\nindustrious, sober-faced young fellow, was invested by his father with\r\nthe powers of second in command; and as strict and swift obedience was\r\na prime tenet in the farmer's domestic government, the children all\r\ntacitly submitted to their brother's sway--all but one, and that was\r\nFrank. The farmer's wife was a quiet woman, in rather tender health; and\r\nthough for all her offspring she had a mother's love, Frank's kiss\r\never seem'd sweetest to her lips. She favor'd him more than the\r\nrest--perhaps, as in a hundred similar instances, for his being so often\r\nat fault, and so often blamed. In truth, however, he seldom receiv'd\r\nmore blame than he deserv'd, for he was a capricious, high-temper'd lad,\r\nand up to all kinds of mischief. From these traits he was known in the\r\nneighborhood by the name of Wild Frank.\r\n\r\nAmong the farmer's stock there was a fine young blood mare--a beautiful\r\ncreature, large and graceful, with eyes like dark-hued jewels, and her\r\ncolor that of the deep night. It being the custom of the farmer to let\r\nhis boys have something about the farm that they could call their\r\nown, and take care of as such, Black Nell, as the mare was called, had\r\nsomehow or other fallen to Frank's share. He was very proud of her, and\r\nthought as much of her comfort as his own. The elder brother, however,\r\nsaw fit to claim for himself, and several times to exercise, a privilege\r\nof managing and using Black Nell, notwithstanding what Frank consider'd\r\nhis prerogative. On one of these occasions a hot dispute arose, and,\r\nafter much angry blood, it was referr'd to the farmer for settlement. He\r\ndecided in favor of Richard, and added a harsh lecture to his other son.\r\nThe farmer was really unjust; and Wild Frank's face paled with rage and\r\nmortification. That furious temper which he had never been taught\r\nto curb, now swell'd like an overflowing torrent. With difficulty\r\nrestraining the exhibition of his passions, as soon as he got by himself\r\nhe swore that not another sun should roll by and find him under that\r\nroof. Late at night he silently arose, and turning his back on what he\r\nthought an inhospitable home, in mood in which the child should never\r\nleave the parental roof, bent his steps toward the city.\r\n\r\nIt may well be imagined that alarm and grief pervaded the whole of the\r\nfamily, on discovering Frank's departure. And as week after week melted\r\naway and brought no tidings of him, his poor mother's heart grew wearier\r\nand wearier. She spoke not much, but was evidently sick in spirit.\r\nNearly two years had claps'd when about a week before the incidents\r\nat the commencement of this story, the farmer's family were joyfully\r\nsurprised by receiving a letter from the long absent son. He had been\r\nto sea, and was then in New York, at which port his vessel had just\r\narrived. He wrote in a gay strain; appear'd to have lost the angry\r\nfeeling which caused his flight from home; and said he heard in the city\r\nthat Richard had married, and settled several miles distant, where he\r\nwished him all good luck and happiness. Wild Frank wound up his letter\r\nby promising, as soon as he could get through the imperative business of\r\nhis ship, to pay a visit to his parents and native place. On Tuesday of\r\nthe succeeding week, he said he would be with them.\r\n\r\nWithin half an hour after the departure of old Joe, the form of that\r\nancient personage was seen slowly wheeling round the locust-tree at the\r\nend of the lane, accompanied by a stout young man in primitive homespun\r\napparel. The meeting between Wild Frank and his brother Richard, though\r\nhardly of that kind which generally takes place between persons so\r\nclosely related, could not exactly be call'd distant or cool either.\r\nRichard press'd his brother to go with him to the farmhouse, and refresh\r\nand repose himself for some hours at least, but Frank declined.\r\n\r\n\"They will all expect me home this afternoon,\" he said, \"I wrote to them\r\nI would be there to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you must be very tired, Frank,\" rejoin'd the other; \"won't you\r\nlet some of us harness up and carry you? Or if you like--\" he stopp'd\r\na moment, and a trifling suffusion spread over his face; \"if you like,\r\nI'll put the saddle on Black Nell--she's here at my place now, and you\r\ncan ride home like a lord.\"\r\n\r\nFrank's face color'd a little, too. He paused for a moment in\r\nthought--he was really foot-sore, and exhausted with his journey that\r\nhot day--so he accepted his brother's offer.\r\n\r\n\"You know the speed of Nell, as well as I,\" said Richard; \"I'll warrant\r\nwhen I bring her here you'll say she's in good order as ever.\" So\r\ntelling him to amuse himself for a few minutes as well as he could,\r\nRichard left the tavern.\r\n\r\nCould it be that Black Nell knew her early master? She neigh'd and\r\nrubb'd her nose on his shoulder; and as he put his foot in the stirrup\r\nand rose on her back, it was evident that they were both highly pleased\r\nwith their meeting. Bidding his brother farewell, and not forgetting old\r\nJoe, the young man set forth on his journey to his father's house. As he\r\nleft the village behind, and came upon the long monotonous road before\r\nhim, he thought on the circumstances of his leaving home--and he\r\nthought, too, on his course of life, how it was being frittered away\r\nand lost. Very gentle influences, doubtless, came over Wild Frank's\r\nmind then, and he yearn'd to show his parents that he was sorry for the\r\ntrouble he had cost them. He blamed himself for his former follies, and\r\neven felt remorse that he had not acted more kindly to Richard, and gone\r\nto his house. Oh, it had been a sad mistake of the farmer that he did\r\nnot teach his children to love one another. It was a foolish thing\r\nthat he prided himself on governing his little flock well, when sweet\r\naffection, gentle forbearance, and brotherly faith, were almost unknown\r\namong them.\r\n\r\nThe day was now advanced, though the heat pour'd down with a strength\r\nlittle less oppressive than at noon. Frank had accomplish'd the greater\r\npart of his journey; he was within two miles of his home. The road here\r\nled over a high, tiresome hill, and he determined to stop on the top of\r\nit and rest himself, as well as give the animal he rode a few minutes'\r\nbreath. How well he knew the place! And that mighty oak, standing just\r\noutside the fence on the very summit of the hill, often had he reposed\r\nunder its shade. It would be pleasant for a few minutes to stretch his\r\nlimbs there again as of old, he thought to himself; and he dismounted\r\nfrom the saddle and led Black Nell under the tree. Mindful of the\r\ncomfort of his favorite, he took from his little bundle, which he had\r\nstrapped behind him on the mare's back, a piece of strong cord, four or\r\nfive yards in length, which he tied to the bridle, and wound and tied\r\nthe other end, for security, over his own wrist; then throwing himself\r\nat full length upon the ground, Black Nell was at liberty to graze\r\naround him, without danger of straying away.\r\n\r\nIt was a calm scene, and a pleasant. There was no rude sound--hardly\r\neven a chirping insect--to break the sleepy silence of the place. The\r\natmosphere had a dim, hazy cast, and was impregnated with overpowering\r\nheat. The young man lay there minute after minute, as time glided away\r\nunnoticed; for he was very tired, and his repose was sweet to him.\r\nOccasionally he raised himself and cast a listless look at the distant\r\nlandscape, veil'd as it was by the slight mist. At length his repose was\r\nwithout such interruptions. His eyes closed, and though at first they\r\nopen'd languidly again at intervals, after a while they shut altogether.\r\nCould it be that he slept? It was so indeed. Yielding to the drowsy\r\ninfluences about him, and to his prolong'd weariness of travel, he had\r\nfallen into a deep, sound slumber. Thus he lay; and Black Nell, the\r\noriginal cause of his departure from his home--by a singular chance, the\r\ncompanion of his return--quietly cropp'd the grass at his side.\r\n\r\nAn hour nearly pass'd away, and yet the young man slept on. The light\r\nand heat were not glaring now; a change had come over earth and heaven.\r\nThere were signs of one of those thunderstorms that in our climate\r\nspring up and pass over so quickly and so terribly. Masses of vapor\r\nloom' d up in the horizon, and a dark shadow settled on the woods and\r\nfields. The leaves of the great oak rustled together over the youth's\r\nhead. Clouds flitted swiftly in the sky, like bodies of armed men coming\r\nup to battle at the call of their leader's trumpet. A thick rain-drop\r\nfell now and then, while occasionally hoarse mutterings of thunder\r\nsounded in the distance; yet the slumberer was not arous'd. It was\r\nstrange that Wild Frank did not awake. Perhaps his ocean life had taught\r\nhim to rest undisturbed amid the jarring of elements. Though the storm\r\nwas now coming on in its fury, he slept like a babe in its cradle.\r\n\r\nBlack Nell had ceased grazing, and stood by her sleeping master with\r\nears erect, and her long mane and tail waving in the wind. It seem'd\r\nquite dark, so heavy were the clouds. The blast blew sweepingly, the\r\nlightning flash'd, and the rain fell in torrents. Crash after crash of\r\nthunder seem'd to shake the solid earth. And Black Nell, she stood now,\r\nan image of beautiful terror, with her fore feet thrust out, her neck\r\narch'd, and her eyes glaring balls of fear. At length, after a dazzling\r\nand lurid glare, there came a peal--a deafening crash--as if the great\r\naxle was rent. God of Spirits! the startled mare sprang off like a ship\r\nin an ocean-storm! Her eyes were blinded with light; she dashed madly\r\ndown the hill, and plunge after plunge--far, far away--swift as an\r\narrow--dragging the hapless body of the youth behind her!\r\n\r\nIn the low, old-fashion'd dwelling of the farmer there was a large\r\nfamily group. The men and boys had gather'd under shelter at the\r\napproach of the storm; and the subject of their talk was the return\r\nof the long absent son. The mother spoke of him, too, and her eyes\r\nbrighten'd with pleasure as she spoke. She made all the little domestic\r\npreparations--cook'd his favorite dishes--and arranged for him his\r\nown bed, in its own old place. As the tempest mounted to its fury they\r\ndiscuss'd the probability of his getting soak'd by it; and the provident\r\ndame had already selected some dry garments for a change. But the rain\r\nwas soon over, and nature smiled again in her invigorated beauty. The\r\nsun shone out as it was dipping in the west. Drops sparkled on the\r\nleaf-tips--coolness and clearness were in the air.\r\n\r\nThe clattering of a horse's hoofs came to the ears of those who were\r\ngather'd there. It was on the other side of the house that the wagon\r\nroad lead; and they open'd the door and rush'd in a tumult of glad\r\nanticipations, through the adjoining room to the porch. What a sight it\r\nwas that met them there! Black Nell stood a few feet from the door, with\r\nher neck crouch'd down; she drew her breath long and deep, and vapor\r\nrose from every part of her reeking body. And with eyes starting from\r\ntheir sockets, and mouths agape with stupefying terror, they beheld on\r\nthe ground near her a mangled, hideous mass--the rough semblance of a\r\nhuman form--all batter'd, and cut, and bloody. Attach'd to it was the\r\nfatal cord, dabbled over with gore. And as the mother gazed--for she\r\ncould not withdraw her eyes--and the appalling truth came upon her mind,\r\nshe sank down without shriek or utterance, into a deep, deathly swoon.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOY LOVER\r\n\r\nListen, and the old will speak a chronicle for the young. Ah, youth!\r\nthou art one day coming to be old, too. And let me tell thee how thou\r\nmayest get a useful lesson. For an hour, _dream thyself old_. Realize,\r\nin thy thoughts and consciousness, that vigor and strength are subdued\r\nin thy sinews--that the color of the shroud is liken'd in thy very\r\nhairs--that all those leaping desires, luxurious hopes, beautiful\r\naspirations, and proud confidences, of thy younger life, have long been\r\nburied (a funeral for the better part of thee) in that grave which must\r\nsoon close over thy tottering limbs. Look back, then, through the long\r\ntrack of the past years. How has it been with thee? Are there bright\r\nbeacons of happiness enjoy'd, and of good done by the way? Glimmer\r\ngentle rays of what was scatter'd from a holy heart? Have benevolence,\r\nand love, and undeviating honesty left tokens on which thy eyes can rest\r\nsweetly? Is it well with thee, thus? Answerest thou, it is? Or answerest\r\nthou, I see nothing but gloom and shatter'd hours, and the wreck of good\r\nresolves, and a broken heart, filled with sickness, and troubled among\r\nits ruined chambers with the phantoms of many follies?\r\n\r\nO, youth! youth! this dream will one day be a _reality_--a reality,\r\neither of heavenly peace or agonizing sorrow.\r\n\r\nAnd yet not for all is it decreed to attain the neighborhood of the\r\nthree-score and ten years--the span of life. I am to speak of one\r\nwho died young. Very awkward was his childhood--but most fragile and\r\nsensitive! So delicate a nature may exist in a rough, unnoticed plant!\r\nLet the boy rest;--he was not beautiful, and dropp'd away betimes. But\r\nfor the cause--it is a singular story, to which let crusted worldlings\r\npay the tribute of a light laugh--light and empty as their own hollow\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\nLove! which with its cankerseed of decay within, has sent young men\r\nand maidens to a long'd-for, but too premature burial. Love! the\r\nchild-monarch that Death itself cannot conquer; that has its tokens on\r\nslabs at the head of grass-cover'd tombs--tokens more visible to the\r\neye of the stranger, yet not so deeply graven as the face and the\r\nremembrances cut upon the heart of the living. Love! the sweet, the\r\npure, the innocent; yet the causer of fierce hate, of wishes for deadly\r\nrevenge, of bloody deeds, and madness, and the horrors of hell. Love!\r\nthat wanders over battlefields, turning up mangled human trunks, and\r\nparting back the hair from gory faces, and daring the points of swords\r\nand the thunder of artillery, without a fear or a thought of danger.\r\n\r\nWords! words! I begin to see I am, indeed, an old man, and garrulous!\r\nLet me go back--yes, I see it must be many years!\r\n\r\nIt was at the close of the last century. I was at that time studying\r\nlaw, the profession my father follow'd. One of his clients was an\r\nelderly widow, a foreigner, who kept a little ale-house, on the banks of\r\nthe North River, at about two miles from what is now the centre of the\r\ncity. Then the spot was quite out of town and surrounded by fields and\r\ngreen trees. The widow often invited me to come and pay her a visit,\r\nwhen I had a leisure afternoon--including also in the invitation my\r\nbrother and two other students who were in my father's office. Matthew,\r\nthe brother I mention, was a boy of sixteen; he was troubled with an\r\ninward illness--though it had no power over his temper, which ever\r\nretain' d the most admirable placidity and gentleness.\r\n\r\nHe was cheerful, but never boisterous, and everybody loved him; his mind\r\nseem'd more develop'd than is usual for his age, though his personal\r\nappearance was exceedingly plain. Wheaton and Brown, the names of the\r\nother students, were spirited, clever young fellows, with most of the\r\ntraits that those in their position of life generally possess. The\r\nfirst was as generous and brave as any man I ever knew. He was very\r\npassionate, too, but the whirlwind soon blew over, and left everything\r\nquiet again. Frank Brown was slim, graceful, and handsome. He profess'd\r\nto be fond of sentiment, and used to fall regularly in love once a\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nThe half of every Wednesday we four youths had to ourselves, and were\r\nin the habit of taking a sail, a ride, or a walk together. One of these\r\nafternoons, of a pleasant day in April, the sun shining, and the air\r\nclear, I bethought myself of the widow and her beer--about which latter\r\narticle I had made inquiries, and heard it spoken of in terms of\r\nhigh commendation. I mention'd the matter to Matthew and to my\r\nfellow-students, and we agreed to fill up our holiday by a jaunt to the\r\nale-house. Accordingly, we set forth, and, after a fine walk, arrived in\r\nglorious spirits at our destination.\r\n\r\nAh! how shall I describe the quiet beauties of the spot, with its long,\r\nlow piazza looking out upon the river, and its clean homely tables,\r\nand the tankards of real silver in which the ale was given us, and the\r\nflavor of that excellent liquor itself. There was the widow; and there\r\nwas a sober, stately old woman, half companion, half servant, Margery\r\nby name; and there was (good God! my fingers quiver yet as I write the\r\nword!) young Ninon, the daughter of the widow.\r\n\r\nO, through the years that live no more, my memory strays back, and that\r\nwhole scene comes up before me once again-and the brightest part of\r\nthe picture is the strange ethereal beauty of that young girl! She\r\nwas apparently about the age of my brother Matthew, and the most\r\nfascinating, artless creature I had ever beheld. She had blue eyes and\r\nlight hair, and an expression of childish simplicity which was charming\r\nindeed. I have no doubt that ere half an hour had elapsed from the time\r\nwe enter'd the tavern and saw Ninon, every one of the four of us loved\r\nthe girl to the very depth of passion.\r\n\r\nWe neither spent so much money, nor drank as much beer, as we had\r\nintended before starting from home. The widow was very civil, being\r\npleased to see us, and Margery served our wants with a deal of\r\npoliteness--but it was to Ninon that the afternoon's pleasure was\r\nattributable; for though we were strangers, we became acquainted at\r\nonce--the manners of the girl, merry as she was, putting entirely out of\r\nview the most distant imputation of indecorum--and the presence of the\r\nwidow and Margery, (for we were all in the common room together, there\r\nbeing no other company,) serving to make us all disembarrass'd, and at\r\nease.\r\n\r\nIt was not until quite a while after sunset that we started on our\r\nreturn to the city. We made several attempts to revive the mirth and\r\nlively talk that usually signalized our rambles, but they seem'd forced\r\nand discordant, like laughter in a sick-room. My brother was the only\r\none who preserved his usual tenor of temper and conduct.\r\n\r\nI need hardly say that thenceforward every Wednesday afternoon was spent\r\nat the widow's tavern. Strangely, neither Matthew or my two friends, or\r\nmyself, spoke to each other of the sentiment that filled us in reference\r\nto Ninon. Yet we all knew the thoughts and feelings of the others; and\r\neach, perhaps, felt confident that his love alone was unsuspected by his\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nThe story of the widow was a touching yet simple one. She was by birth\r\na Swiss. In one of the cantons of her native land, she had grown up, and\r\nmarried, and lived for a time in happy comfort. A son was born to her,\r\nand a daughter, the beautiful Ninon. By some reverse of fortune, the\r\nfather and head of the family had the greater portion of his possessions\r\nswept from him. He struggled for a time against the evil influence, but\r\nit press'd upon him harder and harder. He had heard of a people in the\r\nwestern world--a new and swarming land--where the stranger was welcom'd,\r\nand peace and the protection of the strong arm thrown around him. He had\r\nnot heart to stay and struggle amid the scenes of his former prosperity,\r\nand he determin'd to go and make his home in that distant republic of\r\nthe west. So with his wife and children, and the proceeds of what little\r\nproperty was left, he took passage for New York. He was never to reach\r\nhis journey's end. Either the cares that weigh' d upon his mind, or some\r\nother cause, consign'd him to a sick hammock, from which he only found\r\nrelief through the Great Dismisser. He was buried in the sea, and in due\r\ntime his family arrived at the American emporium. But there, the son too\r\nsicken'd--died, ere long, and was buried likewise. They would not bury\r\nhim in the city, but away--by the solitary banks of the Hudson; on which\r\nthe widow soon afterwards took up her abode.\r\n\r\nNinon was too young to feel much grief at these sad occurrences; and the\r\nmother, whatever she might have suffer'd inwardly, had a good deal of\r\nphlegm and patience, and set about making herself and her remaining\r\nchild as comfortable as might be. They had still a respectable sum in\r\ncash, and after due deliberation, the widow purchas'd the little quiet\r\ntavern, not far from the grave of her boy; and of Sundays and holidays\r\nshe took in considerable money--enough to make a decent support for\r\nthem in their humble way of living. French and Germans visited the house\r\nfrequently, and quite a number of young Americans too. Probably the\r\ngreatest attraction to the latter was the sweet face of Ninon.\r\n\r\nSpring passed, and summer crept in and wasted away, and autumn had\r\narrived. Every New Yorker knows what delicious weather we have, in these\r\nregions, of the early October days; how calm, clear, and divested of\r\nsultriness, is the air, and how decently nature seems preparing for her\r\nwinter sleep.\r\n\r\nThus it was the last Wednesday we started on our accustomed excursion.\r\nSix months had elapsed since our first visit, and, as then, we were full\r\nof the exuberance of young and joyful hearts. Frequent and hearty were\r\nour jokes, by no means particular about the theme or the method, and\r\nlong and loud the peals of laughter that rang over the fields or along\r\nthe shore.\r\n\r\nWe took our seats round the same clean, white table, and received our\r\nfavorite beverage in the same bright tankards. They were set before us\r\nby the sober Margery, no one else being visible. As frequently happen'd,\r\nwe were the only company. Walking and breathing the keen, fine air had\r\nmade us dry, and we soon drain'd the foaming vessels, and call'd for\r\nmore. I remember well an animated chat we had about some poems that\r\nhad just made their appearance from a great British author, and were\r\ncreating quite a public stir. There was one, a tale of passion and\r\ndespair, which Wheaton had read, and of which he gave us a transcript.\r\nWild, startling, and dreamy, perhaps it threw over our minds its\r\npeculiar cast. An hour moved off, and we began to think it strange that\r\nneither Ninon or the widow came into the room. One of us gave a hint to\r\nthat effect to Margery; but she made no answer, and went on in her usual\r\nway as before.\r\n\r\n\"The grim old thing,\" said Wheaton, \"if she were in Spain, they'd make\r\nher a premier duenna!\"\r\n\r\nI ask'd the woman about Ninon and the widow. She seemed disturb'd, I\r\nthought; but, making no reply to the first part of my question, said\r\nthat her mistress was in another part of the house, and did not wish to\r\nbe with company.\r\n\r\n\"Then be kind enough, Mrs. Vinegar,\" resumed Wheaton, good-naturedly,\r\n\"be kind enough to go and ask the widow if we can see Ninon.\"\r\n\r\nOur attendant's face turn'd as pale as ashes, and she precipitately left\r\nthe apartment. We laugh'd at her agitation, which Frank Brown assigned\r\nto our merry ridicule.\r\n\r\nQuite a quarter of an hour elaps'd before Margery's return. When she\r\nappear'd she told us briefly that the widow had bidden her obey our\r\nbehest, and now, if we desired, she would conduct us to the daughter's\r\npresence. There was a singular expression in the woman's eyes, and\r\nthe whole affair began to strike us as somewhat odd; but we arose, and\r\ntaking our caps, follow'd her as she stepp'd through the door. Back of\r\nthe house were some fields, and a path leading into clumps of trees. At\r\nsome thirty rods distant from the tavern, nigh one of those clumps, the\r\nlarger tree whereof was a willow, Margery stopp'd, and pausing a minute,\r\nwhile we came up, spoke in tones calm and low:\r\n\r\n\"Ninon is there!\"\r\n\r\nShe pointed downward with her finger. Great God! There was a _grave_,\r\nnew made, and with the sods loosely join'd, and a rough brown stone at\r\neach extremity! Some earth yet lay upon the grass near by. If we had\r\nlook'd, we might have seen the resting-place of the widow's son, Ninon's\r\nbrother--for it was close at hand. But amid the whole scene our eyes\r\ntook in nothing except that horrible covering of death--the oven-shaped\r\nmound. My sight seemed to waver, my head felt dizzy, and a feeling of\r\ndeadly sickness came over me. I heard a stifled exclamation, and looking\r\nround, saw Frank Brown leaning against the nearest tree, great sweat\r\nupon his forehead, and his cheeks bloodless as chalk. Wheaton gave\r\nway to his agony more fully than ever I had known a man before; he had\r\nfallen--sobbing like a child, and wringing his hands. It is impossible\r\nto describe the suddenness and fearfulness of the sickening truth that\r\ncame upon us like a stroke of thunder.\r\n\r\nOf all of us, my brother Matthew neither shed tears, or turned pale,\r\nor fainted, or exposed any other evidence of inward depth of pain. His\r\nquiet, pleasant voice was indeed a tone lower, but it was that which\r\nrecall'd us, after the lapse of many long minutes, to ourselves.\r\n\r\nSo the girl had died and been buried. We were told of an illness that\r\nhad seized her the very day after our last preceding visit; but we\r\ninquired not into the particulars.\r\n\r\nAnd now come I to the conclusion of my story, and to the most singular\r\npart of it. The evening of the third day afterward, Wheaton, who had\r\nwept scalding tears, and Brown, whose cheeks had recovered their color,\r\nand myself, that for an hour thought my heart would never rebound again\r\nfrom the fearful shock--that evening, I say, we three were seated around\r\na table in another tavern, drinking other beer, and laughing but a\r\nlittle less cheerfully, and as though we had never known the widow or\r\nher daughter--neither of whom, I venture to affirm, came into our minds\r\nonce the whole night, or but to be dismiss'd again, carelessly, like the\r\nremembrance of faces seen in a crowd.\r\n\r\nStrange are the contradictions of the things of life! The seventh day\r\nafter that dreadful visit saw my brother Matthew--the delicate one, who,\r\nwhile bold men writhed in torture, had kept the same placid face, and\r\nthe same untrembling fingers--him that seventh day saw a clay-cold\r\ncorpse, carried to the repose of the churchyard. The shaft, rankling\r\nfar down and within, wrought a poison too great for show, and the youth\r\ndied.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHILD AND THE PROFLIGATE\r\n\r\nJust after sunset, one evening in summer--that pleasant hour when the\r\nair is balmy, the light loses its glare, and all around is imbued with\r\nsoothing quiet--on the door-step of a house there sat an elderly woman\r\nwaiting the arrival of her son. The house was in a straggling village\r\nsome fifty miles from New York city. She who sat on the door-step was a\r\nwidow; her white cap cover'd locks of gray, and her dress, though clean,\r\nwas exceedingly homely. Her house--for the tenement she occupied was her\r\nown--was very little and very old. Trees clustered around it so thickly\r\nas almost to hide its color--that blackish gray color which belongs to\r\nold wooden houses that have never been painted; and to get in it you had\r\nto enter a little rickety gate and walk through a short path, border'd\r\nby carrot beds and beets and other vegetables. The son whom she was\r\nexpecting was her only child. About a year before he had been bound\r\napprentice to a rich farmer in the place, and after finishing his daily\r\ntask he was in the habit of spending half an hour at his mother's. On\r\nthe present occasion the shadows of night had settled heavily before the\r\nyouth made his appearance. When he did, his walk was slow and dragging,\r\nand all his motions were languid, as if from great weariness. He open'd\r\nthe gate, came through the path, and sat down by his mother in silence.\r\n\r\n\"You are sullen to-night, Charley,\" said the widow, after a moment's\r\npause, when she found that he return' d no answer to her greeting.\r\n\r\nAs she spoke she put her hand fondly on his head; it seem'd moist as if\r\nit had been dipp'd in the water. His shirt, too, was soak'd; and as\r\nshe pass'd her fingers down his shoulder she left a sharp twinge in her\r\nheart, for she knew that moisture to be the hard wrung sweat of severe\r\ntoil, exacted from her young child (he was but thirteen years old) by an\r\nunyielding taskmaster.\r\n\r\n\"You have work'd hard to-day, my son.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been mowing.\"\r\n\r\nThe widow's heart felt another pang.\r\n\r\n\"Not _all day_, Charley?\" she said, in a low voice; and there was a\r\nslight quiver in it.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, mother, all day,\" replied the boy; \"Mr. Ellis said he couldn't\r\nafford to hire men, for wages are so high. I've swung the scythe ever\r\nsince an hour before sunrise. Feel of my hands.\"\r\n\r\nThere were blisters on them like great lumps. Tears started in the\r\nwidow's eyes. She dared not trust herself with a reply, though her heart\r\nwas bursting with the thought that she could not better his condition.\r\nThere was no earthly means of support on which she had dependence enough\r\nto encourage her child in the wish she knew he was forming--the wish not\r\nutter'd for the first time--to be freed from his bondage. \"Mother,\" at\r\nlength said the boy, \"I can stand it no longer. I cannot and will not\r\nstay at Mr. Ellis's. Ever since the day I first went into his house I've\r\nbeen a slave; and if I have to work so much longer I know I shall run\r\noff and go to sea or somewhere else. I'd as leave be in my grave as\r\nthere.\" And the child burst into a passionate fit of weeping.\r\n\r\nHis mother was silent, for she was in deep grief herself. After some\r\nminutes had flown, however, she gather'd sufficient self-possession to\r\nspeak to her son in a soothing tone, endeavoring to win him from his\r\nsorrows and cheer up his heart. She told him that time was swift--that\r\nin the course of a few years he would be his own master.--that all\r\npeople have their troubles--with many other ready arguments which,\r\nthough they had little effect in calming her own distress, she hoped\r\nwould act as a solace to the disturb'd temper of the boy. And as the\r\nhalf hour to which he was limited had now elaps'd, she took him by the\r\nhand and led him to the gate, to set forth on his return. The youth\r\nseemed pacified, though occasionally one of those convulsive sighs that\r\nremain after a fit of weeping, would break from his throat. At the gate\r\nhe threw his arms about his mother's neck; each press'd a long kiss\r\non the lips of the other, and the youngster bent his steps towards his\r\nmaster's house.\r\n\r\nAs her child pass'd out of sight the widow return'd, shut the gate and\r\nenter'd her lonely room. There was no light in the old cottage that\r\nnight--the heart of its occupant was dark and cheerless. Love, agony,\r\nand grief, and tears and convulsive wrestlings were there. The thought\r\nof a beloved son condemned to labor--labor that would break down a\r\nman--struggling from day to day under the hard rule of a soulless\r\ngold-worshipper; the knowledge that years must pass thus; the sickening\r\nidea of her own poverty, and of living mainly on the grudged charity of\r\nneighbors--thoughts, too, of former happy days--these rack'd the widow's\r\nheart, and made her bed a sleepless one without repose.\r\n\r\nThe boy bent his steps to his employer's, as has been said. In his way\r\ndown the village street he had to pass a public house, the only one the\r\nplace contain'd; and when he came off against it he heard the sound of\r\na fiddle--drown'd, however, at intervals, by much laughter and talking.\r\nThe windows were up, and, the house standing close to the road, Charles\r\nthought it no harm to take a look and see what was going on within. Half\r\na dozen footsteps brought him to the low casement, on which he lean'd\r\nhis elbow, and where he had a full view of the room and its occupants.\r\nIn one corner was an old man, known in the village as Black Dave--he\r\nit was whose musical performances had a moment before drawn Charles's\r\nattention to the tavern; and he it was who now exerted himself in a\r\nviolent manner to give, with divers flourishes and extra twangs, a tune\r\nvery popular among that thick-lipp'd race whose fondness for melody is\r\nso well known. In the middle of the room were five or six sailors, some\r\nof them quite drunk, and others in the earlier stages of that process,\r\nwhile on benches around were more sailors, and here and there a person\r\ndress'd in landsman's attire. The men in the middle of the room were\r\ndancing; that is, they were going through certain contortions and\r\nshufflings, varied occasionally by exceeding hearty stamps upon the\r\nsanded floor. In short the whole party were engaged in a drunken frolic,\r\nwhich was in no respect different from a thousand other drunken frolics,\r\nexcept, perhaps, that there was less than the ordinary amount of anger\r\nand quarreling. Indeed everyone seem' d in remarkably good humor.\r\n\r\nBut what excited the boy's attention more than any other object was an\r\nindividual, seated on one of the benches opposite, who, though evidently\r\nenjoying the spree as much as if he were an old hand at such business,\r\nseem' d in every other particular to be far out of his element. His\r\nappearance was youthful. He might have been twenty-one or two years\r\nold. His countenance was intelligent, and had the air of city life and\r\nsociety. He was dress'd not gaudily, but in every respect fashionably;\r\nhis coat being of the finest broadcloth, his linen delicate and spotless\r\nas snow, and his whole aspect that of one whose counterpart may now and\r\nthen be seen upon the pave in Broadway of a fine afternoon. He laugh'd\r\nand talk'd with the rest, and it must be confess'd his jokes--like the\r\nmost of those that pass'd current there--were by no means distinguish'd\r\nfor their refinement or purity. Near the door was a small table, cover'd\r\nwith decanters and glasses, some of which had been used, but were used\r\nagain indiscriminately, and a box of very thick and very long cigars.\r\n\r\nOne of the sailors--and it was he who made the largest share of the\r\nhubbub--had but one eye. His chin and cheeks were cover'd with huge,\r\nbushy whiskers, and altogether he had quite a brutal appearance. \"Come,\r\nboys,\" said this gentleman, \"come, let us take a drink. I know you're\r\nall a getting dry;\" and he clench'd his invitation with an appalling\r\noath. This politeness was responded to by a general moving of the\r\ncompany toward the table holding the before-mention'd decanters and\r\nglasses. Clustering there around, each one help'd himself to a very\r\nhandsome portion of that particular liquor which suited his fancy; and\r\nsteadiness and accuracy being at that moment by no means distinguishing\r\ntraits of the arms and legs of the party, a goodly amount of the fluid\r\nwas spill'd upon the floor. This piece of extravagance excited the ire\r\nof the personage who gave the \"treat;\" and that ire was still further\r\nincreas'd when he discover'd two or three loiterers who seem'd disposed\r\nto slight his request to drink. Charles, as we have before mention'd,\r\nwas looking in at the window.\r\n\r\n\"Walk up, boys! walk up! If there be any skulker among us, blast my eyes\r\nif he shan't go down on his marrow bones and taste the liquor we have\r\nspilt! Hallo!\" he exclaim'd as he spied Charles; \"hallo, you chap in the\r\nwindow, come here and take a sup.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he stepp'd to the open casement, put his brawny hands under\r\nthe boy's arms, and lifted him into the room bodily.\r\n\r\n\"There, my lads,\" said he, turning to his companions, \"there's a new\r\nrecruit for you. Not so coarse a one, either,\" he added as he took a\r\nfair view of the boy, who, though not what is called pretty, was fresh\r\nand manly looking, and large for his age.\r\n\r\n\"Come, youngster, take a glass,\" he continued. And he pour'd one nearly\r\nfull of strong brandy.\r\n\r\nNow Charles was not exactly frighten'd, for he was a lively fellow, and\r\nhad often been at the country merry-makings, and at the parties of the\r\nplace; but he was certainly rather abash'd at his abrupt introduction to\r\nthe midst of strangers. So, putting the glass aside, he look'd up with a\r\npleasant smile in his new acquaintance's face.\r\n\r\n\"I've no need for anything now,\" he said, \"but I'm just as much obliged\r\nto you as if I was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poh! man, drink it down,\" rejoin'd the sailor, \"drink it down--it won't\r\nhurt you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, by way of showing its excellence, the one-eyed worthy drain'd it\r\nhimself to the last drop. Then filling it again, he renew'd his efforts\r\nto make the lad go through the same operation.\r\n\r\n\"I've no occasion. Besides, _my mother has often pray'd me not to\r\ndrink,_ and I promised to obey her.\"\r\n\r\nA little irritated by his continued refusal, the sailor, with a loud\r\noath, declared that Charles should swallow the brandy, whether he would\r\nor no. Placing one of his tremendous paws on the back of the boy's head,\r\nwith the other he thrust the edge of the glass to his lips, swearing\r\nat the same time, that if he shook it so as to spill its contents the\r\nconsequences would be of a nature by no means agreeable to his back and\r\nshoulders. Disliking the liquor, and angry at the attempt to overbear\r\nhim, the undaunted child lifted his hand and struck the arm of the\r\nsailor with a blow so sudden that the glass fell and was smash'd to\r\npieces on the floor; while the brandy was about equally divided between\r\nthe face of Charles, the clothes of the sailor, and the sand. By this\r\ntime the whole of the company had their attention drawn to the scene.\r\nSome of them laugh'd when they saw Charles's undisguised antipathy to\r\nthe drink; but they laugh'd still more heartily when he discomfited\r\nthe sailor. All of them, however, were content to let the matter go as\r\nchance would have it--all but the young man of the black coat, who has\r\nbeen spoken of.\r\n\r\nWhat was there in the words which Charles had spoken that carried the\r\nmind of the young man back to former times--to a period when he was\r\nmore pure and innocent than now? \"_My mother has often pray'd me not to\r\ndrink!_\" Ah, how the mist of months roll'd aside, and presented to his\r\nsoul's eye the picture of _his_ mother, and a prayer of exactly similar\r\npurport! Why was it, too, that the young man's heart moved with a\r\nfeeling of kindness toward the harshly treated child?\r\n\r\nCharles stood, his cheek flush'd and his heart throbbing, wiping the\r\ntrickling drops from his face with a handkerchief. At first the sailor,\r\nbetween his drunkenness and his surprise, was much in the condition\r\nof one suddenly awaken'd out of a deep sleep, who cannot call his\r\nconsciousness about him. When he saw the state of things, however, and\r\nheard the jeering laugh of his companions, his dull eye lighting up with\r\nanger, fell upon the boy who had withstood him. He seized Charles with\r\na grip of iron, and with the side of his heavy boot gave him a sharp and\r\nsolid kick. He was about repeating the performance--for the child\r\nhung like a rag in his grasp--but all of a sudden his ears rang, as if\r\npistols were snapp'd close to them; lights of various hues flicker'd\r\nin his eye, (he had but one, it will be remember'd,) and a strong\r\npropelling power caused him to move from his position, and keep moving\r\nuntil he was brought up by the wall. A blow, a cuff given in such a\r\nscientific manner that the hand from which it proceeded was evidently no\r\nstranger to the pugilistic art, had been suddenly planted in the ear of\r\nthe sailor. It was planted by the young man of the black coat. He had\r\nwatch'd with interest the proceeding of the sailor and the boy--two or\r\nthree times he was on the point of interfering; but when the kick was\r\ngiven, his rage was uncontrollable. He sprang from his seat in the\r\nattitude of a boxer--struck the sailor in a manner to cause those\r\nunpleasant sensations which have been described--and would probably have\r\nfollow'd up the attack, had not Charles, now thoroughly terrified, clung\r\naround his legs and prevented his advancing.\r\n\r\nThe scene was a strange one, and for the time quite a silent one. The\r\ncompany had started from their seats, and for a moment held breathless\r\nbut strain'd positions. In the middle of the room stood the young man,\r\nin his not at all ungraceful attitude--every nerve out, and his eyes\r\nflashing brilliantly.\r\n\r\nHe seem'd rooted like a rock; and clasping him, with an appearance of\r\nconfidence in his protection, clung the boy.\r\n\r\n\"You scoundrel!\" cried the young man, his voice thick with passion,\r\n\"dare to touch the boy again, and I'll thrash you till no sense is left\r\nin your body.\"\r\n\r\nThe sailor, now partially recover'd, made some gestures of a belligerent\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, drunken brute!\" continued the angry youth; \"I wish you would!\r\nYou've not had half what you deserve!\"\r\n\r\nUpon sobriety and sense more fully taking their power in the brains of\r\nthe one-eyed mariner, however, that worthy determined in his own\r\nmind that it would be most prudent to let the matter drop. Expressing\r\ntherefore his conviction to that effect, adding certain remarks to the\r\npurport that he \"meant no harm to the lad,\" that he was surprised\r\nat such a gentleman being angry at \"a little piece of fun,\" and so\r\nforth--he proposed that the company should go on with their jollity just\r\nas if nothing had happen'd. In truth, he of the single eye was not a\r\nbad fellow at heart, after all; the fiery enemy whose advances he had\r\nso often courted that night, had stolen away his good feelings, and set\r\nbusy devils at work within him, that might have made his hands do some\r\ndreadful deed, had not the stranger interposed.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the frolic of the party was upon its former footing.\r\nThe young man sat down upon one of the benches, with the boy by his\r\nside, and while the rest were loudly laughing and talking, they\r\ntwo convers'd together. The stranger learn'd from Charles all the\r\nparticulars of his simple story--how his father had died years\r\nsince--how his mother work' d hard for a bare living--and how he\r\nhimself, for many dreary months, had been the servant of a hard-hearted,\r\navaricious master. More and more interested, drawing the child close to\r\nhis side, the young man listen'd to his plainly told history--and thus\r\nan hour pass'd away.\r\n\r\nIt was now past midnight. The young man told Charles that on the morrow\r\nhe would take steps to relieve him from his servitude--that for the\r\npresent night the landlord would probably give him a lodging at the\r\ninn--and little persuading did the host need for that.\r\n\r\nAs he retired to sleep, very pleasant thoughts filled the mind of the\r\nyoung man--thoughts of a worthy action perform'd--thoughts, too, newly\r\nawakened ones, of walking in a steadier and wiser path than formerly.\r\n\r\nThat roof, then, sheltered two beings that night--one of them innocent\r\nand sinless of all wrong--the other--oh, to that other what evil had not\r\nbeen present, either in action or to his desires!\r\n\r\nWho was the stranger? To those that, from ties of relationship or\r\notherwise, felt an interest in him, the answer to that question was not\r\npleasant to dwell upon. His name was Langton--parentless--a dissipated\r\nyoung man--a brawler--one whose too frequent companions were rowdies,\r\nblacklegs, and swindlers. The New York police offices were not strangers\r\nto his countenance. He had been bred to the profession of medicine;\r\nbesides, he had a very respectable income, and his house was in a\r\npleasant street on the west side of the city. Little of his time,\r\nhowever, did Mr. John Langton spend at his domestic hearth; and the\r\nelderly lady who officiated as his housekeeper was by no means surprised\r\nto have him gone for a week or a month at a time, and she knowing\r\nnothing of his whereabouts.\r\n\r\nLiving as he did, the young man was an unhappy being. It was not so much\r\nthat his associates were below his own capacity--for Langton, though\r\nsensible and well bred, was not highly talented or refined--but that he\r\nlived without any steady purpose, that he had no one to attract him to\r\nhis home, that he too easily allow'd himself to be tempted--which caused\r\nhis life to be, of late, one continued scene of dissatisfaction. This\r\ndissatisfaction he sought to drive away by the brandy bottle, and mixing\r\nin all kinds of parties where the object was pleasure. On the present\r\noccasion he had left the city a few days before, and passing his time at\r\na place near the village where Charles and his mother lived. He fell in,\r\nduring the day, with those who were his companions of the tavern spree;\r\nand thus it happen'd that they were all together. Langton hesitated not\r\nto make himself at home with any associate that suited his fancy.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the poor widow rose from her sleepless cot; and from\r\nthat lucky trait in our nature which makes one extreme follow another,\r\nshe set about her toil with a lighten'd heart. Ellis, the farmer, rose,\r\ntoo, short as the nights were, an hour before day; for his god was gain,\r\nand a prime article of his creed was to get as much work as possible\r\nfrom every one around him. In the course of the day Ellis was called\r\nupon by young Langton, and never perhaps in his life was the farmer\r\npuzzled more than at the young man's proposal--his desire to provide for\r\nthe widow's family, a family that could do him no pecuniary good, and\r\nhis willingness to disburse money for that purpose. The widow, too, was\r\ncalled upon, not only on that day, but the next and the next.\r\n\r\nIt needs not that I should particularize the subsequent events of\r\nLangton's and the boy's history--how the reformation of the profligate\r\nmight be dated to begin from that time--how he gradually sever'd the\r\nguilty ties that had so long gall'd him--how he enjoy'd his own home\r\nagain--how the friendship of Charles and himself grew not slack with\r\ntime--and how, when in the course of seasons he became head of a family\r\nof his own, he would shudder at the remembrance of his early dangers and\r\nhis escapes.\r\n\r\n\r\nLINGAVE'S TEMPTATION\r\n\r\n\"Another day,\" utter'd the poet Lingave, as he awoke in the morning,\r\nand turn'd him drowsily on his hard pallet, \"another day comes out,\r\nburthen'd with its weight of woes. Of what use is existence to me?\r\nCrush'd down beneath the merciless heel of poverty, and no promise of\r\nhope to cheer me on, what have I in prospect but a life neglected and a\r\ndeath of misery?\"\r\n\r\nThe youth paused; but receiving no answer to his questions, thought\r\nproper to continue the peevish soliloquy. \"I am a genius, they say,\" and\r\nthe speaker smiled bitterly, \"but genius is not apparel and food. Why\r\nshould I exist in the world, unknown, unloved, press'd with cares, while\r\nso many around me have all their souls can desire? I behold the\r\nsplendid equipages roll by--I see the respectful bow at the presence of\r\npride--and I curse the contrast between my own lot, and the fortune\r\nof the rich. The lofty air--the show of dress--the aristocratic\r\ndemeanor--the glitter of jewels--dazzle my eyes; and sharp-tooth' d envy\r\nworks within me. I hate these haughty and favor'd ones. Why should my\r\npath be so much rougher than theirs? Pitiable, unfortunate man that I\r\nam! to be placed beneath those whom in my heart I despise--and to be\r\nconstantly tantalized with the presence of that wealth I cannot enjoy!\"\r\nAnd the poet cover'd his eyes with his hands, and wept from very passion\r\nand fretfulness.\r\n\r\nO, Lingave! be more of a man! Have you not the treasures of health and\r\nuntainted propensities, which many of those you envy never enjoy? Are\r\nyou not their superior in mental power, in liberal views of mankind, and\r\nin comprehensive intellect? And even allowing you the choice, how would\r\nyou shudder at changing, in total, conditions with them! Besides,\r\nwere you willing to devote all your time and energies, you could gain\r\nproperty too: squeeze, and toil, and worry, and twist everything into a\r\nmatter of profit, and you can become a great man, as far as money goes\r\nto make greatness.\r\n\r\nRetreat, then, man of the polish'd soul, from those irritable complaints\r\nagainst your lot-those longings for wealth and puerile distinction, not\r\nworthy your class. Do justice, philosopher, to your own powers. While\r\nthe world runs after its shadows and its bubbles, (thus commune in your\r\nown mind,) we will fold ourselves in our circle of understanding, and\r\nlook with an eye of apathy on those things it considers so mighty and\r\nso enviable. Let the proud man pass with his pompous glance--let the gay\r\nflutter in finery--let the foolish enjoy his folly, and the beautiful\r\nmove on in his perishing glory; we will gaze without desire on all their\r\npossessions, and all their pleasures. Our destiny is different from\r\ntheirs. Not for such as we, the lowly flights of their crippled wings.\r\nWe acknowledge no fellow-ship with them in ambition. We composedly look\r\ndown on the paths where they walk, and pursue our own, without uttering\r\na wish to descend, and be as they. What is it to us that the mass pay\r\nus not that deference which wealth commands? We desire no applause, save\r\nthe applause of the good and discriminating--the choice spirits among\r\nmen. Our intellect would be sullied, were the vulgar to approximate to\r\nit, by professing to readily enter in, and praising it. Our pride is a\r\ntowering, and thrice refined pride.\r\n\r\nWhen Lingave had given way to his temper some half hour, or thereabout,\r\nhe grew more calm, and bethought himself that he was acting a very silly\r\npart. He listen'd a moment to the clatter of the carts, and the tramp\r\nof early passengers on the pave below, as they wended along to commence\r\ntheir daily toil. It was just sunrise, and the season was summer. A\r\nlittle canary bird, the only pet poor Lingave could afford to keep,\r\nchirp'd merrily in its cage on the wall. How slight a circumstance will\r\nsometimes change the whole current of our thoughts! The music of that\r\nbird abstracting the mind of the poet but a moment from his sorrows,\r\ngave a chance for his natural buoyancy to act again.\r\n\r\nLingave sprang lightly from his bed, and perform'd his ablutions and his\r\nsimple toilet--then hanging the cage on a nail outside the window, and\r\nspeaking an endearment to the songster, which brought a perfect flood of\r\nmelody in return--he slowly passed through his door, descended the\r\nlong narrow turnings of the stairs, and stood in the open street.\r\nUndetermin'd as to any particular destination, he folded his hands\r\nbehind him, cast his glance upon the ground, and moved listlessly\r\nonward.\r\n\r\nHour after hour the poet walk'd along--up this street and down that--he\r\nreck'd not how or where. And as crowded thoroughfares are hardly the\r\nmost fit places for a man to let his fancy soar in the clouds--many a\r\npush and shove and curse did the dreamer get bestow'd upon him.\r\n\r\nThe booming of the city clock sounded forth the hour twelve--high noon.\r\n\r\n\"Ho! Lingave!\" cried a voice from an open basement window as the poet\r\npass'd.\r\n\r\nHe stopp'd, and then unwittingly would have walked on still, not fully\r\nawaken'd from his reverie.\r\n\r\n\"Lingave, I say!\" cried the voice again, and the person to whom the\r\nvoice belong'd stretch'd his head quite out into the area in front,\r\n\"Stop man. Have you forgotten your appointment?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! ah!\" said the poet, and he smiled unmeaningly, and descending\r\nthe steps, went into the office of Ridman, whose call it was that had\r\nstartled him in his walk.\r\n\r\nWho was Ridman? While the poet is waiting the convenience of that\r\npersonage, it may be as well to describe him.\r\n\r\nRidman was a _money-maker_. He had much penetration, considerable\r\nknowledge of the world, and a disposition to be constantly in the midst\r\nof enterprise, excitement, and stir. His schemes for gaining wealth were\r\nvarious; he had dipp'd into almost every branch and channel of business.\r\nA slight acquaintance of several years' standing subsisted between him\r\nand the poet. The day previous a boy had call'd with a note from Ridman\r\nto Lingave, desiring the presence of the latter at the money-maker's\r\nroom. The poet return'd for answer that he would be there. This was the\r\nengagement which he came near breaking.\r\n\r\nRidman had a smooth tongue. All his ingenuity was needed in the\r\nexplanation to his companion of why and wherefore the latter had been\r\nsent for.\r\n\r\nIt is not requisite to state specifically the offer made by the man\r\nof wealth to the poet. Ridman, in one of his enterprises, found it\r\nnecessary to procure the aid of such a person as Lingave--a writer of\r\npower, a master of elegant diction, of fine taste, in style passionate\r\nyet pure, and of the delicate imagery that belongs to the children of\r\nsong. The youth was absolutely startled at the magnificent and permanent\r\nremuneration which was held out to him for a moderate exercise of his\r\ntalents.\r\n\r\nBut the _nature_ of the service required! All the sophistry and art of\r\nRidman could not veil its repulsiveness. The poet was to labor for the\r\nadvancement of what he felt to be unholy--he was to inculcate what\r\nwould lower the perfection of man. He promised to give an answer to the\r\nproposal the succeeding day, and left the place.\r\n\r\nNow during the many hours there was a war going on in the heart of the\r\npoor poet. He was indeed poor; often he had no certainty whether he\r\nshould be able to procure the next day's meals. And the poet knew\r\nthe beauty of truth, and adored, not in the abstract merely, but in\r\npractice, the excellence of upright principles.\r\n\r\nNight came. Lingave, wearied, lay upon his pallet again and slept. The\r\nmisty veil thrown over him, the spirit of poesy came to his visions, and\r\nstood beside him, and look'd down pleasantly with her large eyes, which\r\nwere bright and liquid like the reflection of stars in a lake.\r\n\r\nVirtue, (such imagining, then, seem'd conscious to the soul of the\r\ndreamer,) is ever the sinew of true genius. Together, the two in one,\r\nthey are endow'd with immortal strength, and approach loftily to Him\r\nfrom whom both spring. Yet there are those that having great powers,\r\nbend them to the slavery of wrong. God forgive them! for they surely do\r\nit ignorantly or heedlessly. Oh, could he who lightly tosses around\r\nhim the seeds of evil in his writings, or his enduring thoughts, or his\r\nchance words--could he see how, haply, they are to spring up in distant\r\ntime and poison the air, and putrefy, and cause to sicken--would he not\r\nshrink back in horror? A bad principle, jestingly spoken--a falsehood,\r\nbut of a word--may taint a whole nation! Let the man to whom the great\r\nMaster has given the might of mind, beware how he uses that might. If\r\nfor the furtherance of bad ends, what can be expected but that, as\r\nthe hour of the closing scene draws nigh, thoughts of harm done, and\r\ncapacities distorted from their proper aim, and strength so laid out\r\nthat men must be worse instead of better, through the exertion of that\r\nstrength--will come and swarm like spectres around him?\r\n\r\n\"Be and continue poor, young man,\" so taught one whose counsels should\r\nbe graven on the heart of every youth, \"while others around you grow\r\nrich by fraud and disloyalty. Be without place and power, while others\r\nbeg their way upward. Bear the pain of disappointed hopes, while others\r\ngain the accomplishment of their flattery. Forego the gracious pressure\r\nof a hand, for which others cringe and crawl. Wrap yourself in your own\r\nvirtue, and seek a friend and your daily bread. If you have, in such a\r\ncourse, grown gray with unblench'd honor, bless God and die.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Lingave awoke the next morning, he despatch'd his answer to his\r\nwealthy friend, and then plodded on as in the days before.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE JANE\r\n\r\n\"Lift up!\" was ejaculated as a signal! and click! went the glasses in\r\nthe hands of a party of tipsy men, drinking one night at the bar of one\r\nof the middling order of taverns. And many a wild gibe was utter'd, and\r\nmany a terrible blasphemy, and many an impure phrase sounded out the\r\npollution of the hearts of these half-crazed creatures, as they toss'd\r\ndown their liquor, and made the walls echo with their uproar. The first\r\nand foremost in recklessness was a girlish-faced, fair-hair'd fellow of\r\ntwenty-two or three years. They called him Mike. He seem'd to be look'd\r\nupon by the others as a sort of prompter, from whom they were to take\r\ncue. And if the brazen wickedness evinced by him in a hundred freaks\r\nand remarks to his companions, during their stay in that place, were any\r\ntest of his capacity--there might hardly be one more fit to go forward\r\nas a guide on the road of destruction. From the conversation of the\r\nparty, it appear'd that they had been spending the early part of the\r\nevening in a gambling house.\r\n\r\nA second, third and fourth time were the glasses fill'd; and the effect\r\nthereof began to be perceiv'd in a still higher degree of noise and\r\nloquacity among the revellers. One of the serving-men came in at this\r\nmoment, and whisper'd the barkeeper, who went out, and in a moment\r\nreturn'd again. \"A person,\" he said, \"wish'd to speak with Mr. Michael.\r\nHe waited on the walk in front.\"\r\n\r\nThe individual whose name was mention'd, made his excuses to the others,\r\ntelling them he would be back in a moment, and left the room. As he shut\r\nthe door behind him, and stepp'd into the open air, he saw one of his\r\nbrothers--his elder by eight or ten years--pacing to and fro with rapid\r\nand uneven steps. As the man turn'd in his walk, and the glare of the\r\nstreet lamp fell upon his face, the youth, half-benumb'd as his senses\r\nwere, was somewhat startled at its paleness and evident perturbation.\r\n\"Come with me!\" said the elder brother, hurriedly, \"the illness of our\r\nlittle Jane is worse, and I have been sent for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poh!\" answered the young drunkard, very composedly, \"is that all? I\r\nshall be home by-and-by,\" and he turn'd back again.\r\n\r\n\"But, brother, she is worse than ever before. Perhaps when you arrive\r\nshe may be dead.\"\r\n\r\nThe tipsy one paus'd in his retreat, perhaps alarm'd at the utterance\r\nof that dread word, which seldom fails to shoot a chill to the hearts of\r\nmortals. But he soon calm'd himself, and waving his hand to the other:\r\n\"Why, see,\" said he, \"a score of times at least, have I been call'd away\r\nto the last sickness of our good little sister; and each time it proves\r\nto be nothing worse than some whim of the nurse or physician. Three\r\nyears has the girl been able to live very heartily under her disease;\r\nand I'll be bound she'll stay on earth three years longer.\"\r\n\r\nAnd as he concluded this wicked and most brutal reply, the speaker\r\nopen'd the door and went into the bar-room. But in his intoxication,\r\nduring the hour that follow'd, Mike was far from being at ease. At\r\nthe end of that hour, the words, \"perhaps when you arrive she may be\r\n_dead_?\" were not effaced from his hearing yet, and he started for home.\r\nThe elder brother had wended his way back in sorrow.\r\n\r\nLet me go before the younger one, awhile, to a room in that home. A\r\nlittle girl lay there dying. She had been ill a long time; so it was no\r\nsudden thing for her parents, and her brethren and sisters, to be called\r\nfor the witness of the death agony. The girl was not what might be\r\ncalled beautiful. And yet, there is a solemn kind of loveliness that\r\nalways surrounds a sick child. The sympathy for the weak and helpless\r\nsufferer, perhaps, increases it in our own ideas. The ashiness and the\r\nmoisture on the brow, and the film over the eyeballs--what man can look\r\nupon the sight, and not feel his heart awed within him? Children, I have\r\nsometimes fancied too, increase in beauty as their illness deepens.\r\n\r\nBesides the nearest relatives of little Jane, standing round her\r\nbedside, was the family doctor. He had just laid her wrist down upon the\r\ncoverlet, and the look he gave the mother, was a look in which there was\r\nno hope. \"My child!\" she cried, in uncontrollable agony, \"O! my child!\"\r\nAnd the father, and the sons and daughters, were bowed down in grief,\r\nand thick tears rippled between the fingers held before their eyes.\r\n\r\nThen there was silence awhile. During the hour just by-gone, Jane had,\r\nin her childish way, bestow'd a little gift upon each of her kindred,\r\nas a remembrancer when she should be dead and buried in the grave.\r\nAnd there was one of these simple tokens which had not reach'd\r\nits destination. She held it in her hand now. It was a very small\r\nmuch-thumbed book--a religious story for infants, given her by her\r\nmother when she had first learn'd to read.\r\n\r\nWhile they were all keeping this solemn stillness-broken only by the\r\nsuppress'd sobs of those who stood and watch'd for the passing away of\r\nthe girl's soul--a confusion of some one entering rudely, and speaking\r\nin a turbulent voice, was heard in an adjoining apartment. Again the\r\nvoice roughly sounded out; it was the voice of the drunkard Mike, and\r\nthe father bade one of his sons go and quiet the intruder \"If nought\r\nelse will do,\" said he sternly, \"put him forth by strength. We want no\r\ntipsy brawlers here, to disturb such a scene as this.\" For what moved\r\nthe sick girl uneasily on her pillow, and raised her neck, and motion'd\r\nto her mother? She would that Mike should be brought to her side. And\r\nit was enjoin'd on him whom the father had bade to eject the noisy one,\r\nthat he should tell Mike his sister's request, and beg him to come to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nHe came. The inebriate--his mind sober'd by the deep solemnity of the\r\nscene--stood there, and leaned over to catch the last accounts of one\r\nwho soon was to be with the spirits of heaven. All was the silence of\r\nthe deepest night. The dying child held the young man's hand in one of\r\nhers; with the other she slowly lifted the trifling memorial she had\r\nassigned especially for him, aloft in the air. Her arm shook--her eyes,\r\nnow becoming glassy with the death-damps, were cast toward her brother's\r\nface. She smiled pleasantly, and as an indistinct gurgle came from\r\nher throat, the uplifted hand fell suddenly into the open palm of her\r\nbrother's, depositing the tiny volume there. Little Jane was dead.\r\n\r\nFrom that night, the young man stepped no more in his wild courses, but\r\nwas reform'd.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUMB KATE\r\n\r\nNot many years since--and yet long enough to have been before the\r\nabundance of railroads, and similar speedy modes of conveyance--the\r\ntravelers from Amboy village to the metropolis of our republic were\r\npermitted to refresh themselves, and the horses of the stage had a\r\nbreathing spell, at a certain old-fashion'd tavern, about half way\r\nbetween the two places. It was a quaint, comfortable, ancient house,\r\nthat tavern. Huge buttonwood trees embower'd it round about, and there\r\nwas a long porch in front, the trellis'd work whereof, though old and\r\nmoulder'd, had been, and promised still to be for years, held together\r\nby the tangled folds of a grape vine wreath'd about it like a tremendous\r\nserpent.\r\n\r\nHow clean and fragrant everything was there! How bright the pewter\r\ntankards wherefrom cider or ale went into the parch'd throat of the\r\nthirsty man! How pleasing to look into the expressive eyes of Kate, the\r\nland-lord's lovely daughter, who kept everything so clean and bright!\r\n\r\nNow the reason why Kate's eyes had become so expressive was, that,\r\nbesides their proper and natural office, they stood to the poor girl in\r\nthe place of tongue and ears also. Kate had been dumb from her birth.\r\nEverybody loved the helpless creature when she was a child. Gentle,\r\ntimid, and affectionate was she, and beautiful as the lilies of which\r\nshe loved to cultivate so many every summer in her garden. Her light\r\nhair, and the like-color'd lashes, so long and silky, that droop'd over\r\nher blue eyes of such uncommon size and softness--her rounded shape,\r\nwell set off by a little modest art of dress--her smile--the graceful\r\nease of her motions, always attracted the admiration of the strangers\r\nwho stopped there, and were quite a pride to her parents and friends.\r\n\r\nHow could it happen that so beautiful and inoffensive a being should\r\ntaste, even to its dregs, the bitterest unhappiness? Oh, there\r\nmust indeed be a mysterious, unfathomable meaning in the decrees of\r\nProvidence which is beyond the comprehension of man; for no one on earth\r\nless deserved or needed \"the uses of adversity\" than Dumb Kate. Love,\r\nthe mighty and lawless passion, came into the sanctuary of the maid's\r\npure breast, and the dove of peace fled away forever.\r\n\r\nOne of the persons who had occasion to stop most frequently at the\r\ntavern kept by Dumb Kate's parents was a young man, the son of a wealthy\r\nfarmer, who own'd an estate in the neighborhood. He saw Kate, and\r\nwas struck with her natural elegance. Though not of thoroughly wicked\r\npropensities, the fascination of so fine a prize made this youth\r\ndetermine to gain her love, and, if possible, to win her to himself.\r\nAt first he hardly dared, even amid the depths of his own soul, to\r\nentertain thoughts of vileness against one so confiding and childlike.\r\nBut in a short time such feelings wore away, and he made up his mind to\r\nbecome the betrayer of poor Kate. He was a good-looking fellow, and made\r\nbut too sure of his victim. Kate was lost!\r\n\r\nThe villain came to New York soon after, and engaged in a business which\r\nprosper'd well, and which has no doubt by this time made him what is\r\ncall'd a man of fortune.\r\n\r\nNot long did sickness of the heart wear into the life and happiness of\r\nDumb Kate. One pleasant spring day, the neighbors having been called by\r\na notice the previous morning, the old churchyard was thrown open, and\r\na coffin was borne over the early grass that seem'd so delicate with its\r\nlight green hue. There was a new made grave, and by its side the bier\r\nwas rested--while they paused a moment until holy words had been said.\r\nAn idle boy, call'd there by curiosity, saw something lying on the fresh\r\nearth thrown out from the grave, which attracted his attention. A little\r\nblossom, the only one to be seen around, had grown exactly on the spot\r\nwhere the sexton chose to dig poor Kate's last resting-place. It was a\r\nweak but lovely flower, and now lay where it had been carelessly toss'd\r\namid the coarse gravel. The boy twirl'd it a moment in his fingers--the\r\nbruis'd fragments gave out a momentary perfume, and then fell to the\r\nedge of the pit, over which the child at that moment lean'd and gazed in\r\nhis inquisitiveness. As they dropp'd, they were wafted to the bottom of\r\nthe grave. The last look was bestow'd on the dead girl's face by those\r\nwho loved her so well in life, and then she was softly laid away to her\r\nsleep beneath that green grass covering.\r\n\r\nYet in the churchyard on the hill is Kate's grave. There stands a little\r\nwhite stone at the head, and verdure grows richly there; and gossips,\r\nsome-times of a Sabbath afternoon, rambling over that gathering-place of\r\nthe gone from earth, stop a while, and con over the dumb girl's hapless\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n\r\nTALK TO AN ART-UNION\r\n\r\n_A Brooklyn fragment_\r\n\r\nIt is a beautiful truth that all men contain something of the artist in\r\nthem. And perhaps it is the case that the greatest artists live and die,\r\nthe world and themselves alike ignorant what they possess. Who would\r\nnot mourn that an ample palace, of surpassingly graceful architecture,\r\nfill'd with luxuries, and embellish'd with fine pictures and sculpture,\r\nshould stand cold and still and vacant, and never be known or enjoy'd\r\nby its owner? Would such a fact as this cause your sadness? Then be sad.\r\nFor there is a palace, to which the courts of the most sumptuous kings\r\nare but a frivolous patch, and, though it is always waiting for them,\r\nnot one of its owners ever enters there with any genuine sense of its\r\ngrandeur and glory.\r\n\r\nI think of few heroic actions, which cannot be traced to the\r\nartistical impulse. He who does great deeds, does them from his innate\r\nsensitiveness to moral beauty. Such men are not merely artists, they are\r\nalso artistic material. Washington in some great crisis, Lawrence on\r\nthe bloody deck of the Chesapeake, Mary Stuart at the block, Kossuth\r\nin captivity, and Mazzini in exile--all great rebels and innovators,\r\nexhibit the highest phases of the artist spirit. The painter, the\r\nsculptor, the poet, express heroic beauty better in description; but the\r\nothers _are_ heroic beauty, the best belov'd of art.\r\n\r\nTalk not so much, then, young artist, of the great old masters, who\r\nbut painted and chisell'd. Study not only their productions. There is a\r\nstill higher school for him who would kindle his fire with coal from\r\nthe altar of the loftiest and purest art. It is the school of all grand\r\nactions and grand virtues, of heroism, of the death of patriots and\r\nmartyrs--of all the mighty deeds written in the pages of history--deeds\r\nof daring, and enthusiasm, devotion, and fortitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOOD-MONEY\r\n\r\n\"_Guilty of the body and the blood of Christ_.\"\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n    Of olden time, when it came to pass\r\n    That the beautiful god, Jesus, should finish his work on earth,\r\n    Then went Judas, and sold the divine youth,\r\n    And took pay for his body.\r\n\r\n    Curs'd was the deed, even before the sweat of the clutching hand\r\n      grew dry;\r\n    And darkness frown'd upon the seller of the like of God,\r\n    Where, as though earth lifted her breast to throw him from her,\r\n      and heaven refused him,\r\n    He hung in the air, self-slaughter'd.\r\n\r\n    The cycles, with their long shadows, have stalk'd silently forward,\r\n    Since those ancient days--many a pouch enwrapping meanwhile\r\n    Its fee, like that paid for the son of Mary.\r\n\r\n    And still goes one, saying,\r\n    \"What will ye give me, and I will deliver this man unto you?\"\r\n    And they make the covenant, and pay the pieces of silver.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n    Look forth, deliverer,\r\n    Look forth, first-born of the dead,\r\n    Over the tree-tops of Paradise;\r\n    See thyself in yet continued bonds,\r\n    Toilsome and poor, thou bear'st man's form again,\r\n    Thou art reviled, scourged, put into prison,\r\n    Hunted from the arrogant equality of the rest;\r\n    With staves and swords throng the willing servants of authority,\r\n    Again they surround thee, mad with devilish spite;\r\n    Toward thee stretch the hands of a multitude, like vultures' talons,\r\n    The meanest spit in thy face, they smite thee with their palms;\r\n    Bruised, bloody, and pinion'd is thy body,\r\n    More sorrowful than death is thy soul.\r\n\r\n    Witness of anguish, brother of slaves,\r\n    Not with thy price closed the price of thine image:\r\n    And still Iscariot plies his trade.\r\n\r\n    _April, 1843_.\r\n\r\n    PAUMANOK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDED IN THE HOUSE OF FRIENDS\r\n\r\n_\"And one shall say unto him.

They do good--the deepest, widest, most\r\nneeded good--though quite certainly not in the ways attempted--which\r\nhave, at times, something irresistibly comic. What can be more farcical,\r\nfor instance, than the sight of a worthy gentleman coming three or four\r\nthousand miles through wet and wind to speak complacently and at\r\ngreat length on matters of which he both entirely mistakes or knows\r\nnothing--before crowds of auditors equally complacent, and equally at\r\nfault?\r\n\r\nYet welcome and thanks, we say, to those visitors we have, and have\r\nhad, from abroad among us--and may the procession continue! We have\r\nhad Dickens and Thackeray, Froude, Herbert Spencer, Oscar Wilde, Lord\r\nColeridge--soldiers, savants, poets--and now Matthew Arnold and Irving\r\nthe actor. Some have come to make money--some for a \"good time\"--some to\r\nhelp us along and give us advice--and some undoubtedly to investigate,\r\n_bona fide_, this great problem, democratic America, looming upon the\r\nworld with such cumulative power through a hundred years, now with the\r\nevident intention (since the secession war) to stay, and take a leading\r\nhand, for many a century to come, in civilization's and humanity's\r\neternal game. But alas! that very investigation--the method of that\r\ninvestigation--is where the deficit most surely and helplessly comes in.\r\nLet not Lord Coleridge and Mr. Arnold (to say nothing of the illustrious\r\nactor) imagine that when they have met and survey'd the\r\netiquettical gatherings of our wealthy, distinguish'd and\r\nsure-to-be-put-forward-on-such-occasions citizens (New York, Boston,\r\nPhiladelphia, &c., have certain stereotyped strings of them, continually\r\nlined and paraded like the lists of dishes at hotel tables--you are sure\r\nto get the same over and over again--it is very amusing)--and the bowing\r\nand introducing, the receptions at the swell clubs, the eating and\r\ndrinking and praising and praising back--and the next \"day riding\r\nabout Central Park, or doing the\" Public Institutions \"--and so passing\r\nthrough, one after another, the full-dress coteries of the Atlantic\r\ncities, all grammatical and cultured and correct, with the toned-down\r\nmanners of the gentlemen, and the kid-gloves, and luncheons and\r\nfinger-glasses--Let not our eminent visitors, we say, suppose that, by\r\nmeans of these experiences, they have \"seen America,\" or captur'd any\r\ndistinctive clew or purport thereof. Not a bit of it. Of the pulse-beats\r\nthat lie within and vitalize this Commonweal to-day--of the hard-pan\r\npurports and idiosyncrasies pursued faithfully and triumphantly by its\r\nbulk of men North and South, generation after generation, superficially\r\nunconscious of their own aims, yet none the less pressing onward\r\nwith deathless intuition--those coteries do not furnish the faintest\r\nscintilla. In the Old World the best flavor and significance of a race\r\nmay possibly need to be look'd for in its \"upper classes,\" its gentries,\r\nits court, its _état major_. In the United States the rule is revers'd.\r\nBesides (and a point, this, perhaps deepest of all,) the special marks\r\nof our grouping and design are not going to be understood in a hurry.\r\nThe lesson and scanning right on the ground are difficult; I was going\r\nto say they are impossible to foreigners--but I have occasionally found\r\nthe clearest appreciation of all, coming from far-off quarters. Surely\r\nnothing could be more apt, not only for our eminent visitors present and\r\nto come, but for home study, than the following editorial criticism of\r\nthe London _Times_ on Mr. Froude's visits and lectures here a few years\r\nago, and the culminating dinner given at Delmonico's, with its brilliant\r\narray of guests:\r\n\r\n\"We read the list,\" says the _Times_, \"of those who assembled to do\r\nhonor to Mr. Froude: there were Mr. Emerson, Mr. Beecher, Mr. Curtis,\r\nMr. Bryant; we add the names of those who sent letters of regret that\r\nthey could not attend in person--Mr. Longfellow, Mr. Whittier. They are\r\nnames which are well known--almost as well known and as much honor'd in\r\nEngland as in America; and yet what must we say in the end? The American\r\npeople outside this assemblage of writers is something vaster and\r\ngreater than they, singly or together, can comprehend. It cannot be said\r\nof any or all of them that they can speak for their nation. We who look\r\non at this distance are able perhaps on that account to see the more\r\nclearly that there are qualities of the American people which find no\r\nrepresentation, no voice, among these their spokesmen. And what is true\r\nof them is true of the English class of whom Mr. Froude may be said to\r\nbe the ambassador. Mr. Froude is master of a charming style. He has the\r\ngift of grace and the gift of sympathy. Taking any single character as\r\nthe subject of his study, he may succeed after a very short time in so\r\ncomprehending its workings as to be able to present a living figure\r\nto the intelligence and memory of his readers. But the movements of a\r\nnation, the, _voiceless purpose of a people which cannot put its\r\nown thoughts into words, yet acts upon them in each successive\r\ngeneration_--these things do not lie within his grasp.... The functions\r\nof literature such as he represents are limited in their action; the\r\ninfluence he can wield is artificial and restricted, and, while he and\r\nhis hearers please and are pleas'd with pleasant periods, his great mass\r\nof national life will flow around them unmov'd in its tides by action as\r\npowerless as that of the dwellers by the shore to direct the currents of\r\nthe ocean.\"\r\n\r\nA thought, here, that needs to be echoed, expanded, permanently\r\ntreasur'd by our literary classes and educators. (The gestation, the\r\nyouth, the knitting preparations, are now over, and it is full time for\r\ndefinite purpose, result.) How few think of it, though it is the impetus\r\nand background of our whole Nationality and popular life. In the present\r\nbrief memorandum I very likely for the first time awake \"the intelligent\r\nreader\" to the idea and inquiry whether there isn't such a thing as the\r\ndistinctive genius of our democratic New World, universal, immanent,\r\nbringing to a head the best experience of the past--not specially\r\nliterary or intellectual--not merely \"good,\" (in the Sunday School and\r\nTemperance Society sense,)-some invisible spine and great sympathetic\r\nto these States, resident only in the average people, in their practical\r\nlife, in their physiology, in their emotions, in their nebulous yet\r\nfiery patriotism, in the armies (both sides) through the whole secession\r\nwar--an identity and character which indeed so far \"finds no voice among\r\ntheir spokesmen.\"\r\n\r\nTo my mind America, vast and fruitful as it appears to-day, is even yet,\r\nfor its most important results, entirely in the tentative state; its\r\nvery formation-stir and whirling trials and essays more splendid and\r\npicturesque, to my thinking, than the accomplish'd growths and shows\r\nof other lands, through European history, or Greece, or all the past.\r\nSurely a New World literature, worthy the name, is not to be, if it ever\r\ncomes, some fiction, or fancy, or bit of sentimentalism or polish'd work\r\nmerely by itself, or in abstraction. So long as such literature is no\r\nborn branch and offshoot of the Nationality, rooted and grown from its\r\nroots, and fibred with its fibre, it can never answer any deep call\r\nor perennial need. Perhaps the untaught Republic is wiser than its\r\nteachers. The best literature is always a result of something far\r\ngreater than itself--not the hero, but the portrait of the hero. Before\r\nthere can be recorded history or poem there must be the transaction.\r\nBeyond the old masterpieces, the Iliad, the interminable Hindu epics,\r\nthe Greek tragedies, even the Bible itself, range the immense facts of\r\nwhat must have preceded them, their _sine qua non_--the veritable poems\r\nand masterpieces, of which, grand as they are, the word-statements are\r\nbut shreds and cartoons.\r\n\r\nFor to-day and the States, I think the vividest, rapidest, most\r\nstupendous processes ever known, ever perform'd by man or nation, on the\r\nlargest scales and in countless varieties, are now and here presented.\r\nNot as our poets and preachers are always conventionally putting it--but\r\nquite different. Some colossal foundry, the flaming of the fire, the\r\nmelted metal, the pounding trip-hammers, the surging crowds of workmen\r\nshifting from point to point, the murky shadows, the rolling haze, the\r\ndiscord, the crudeness, the deafening din, the disorder, the dross and\r\nclouds of dust, the waste and extravagance of material, the shafts of\r\ndarted sunshine through the vast open roof-scuttles aloft-the mighty\r\ncastings, many of them not yet fitted, perhaps delay'd long, yet each in\r\nits due time, with definite place and use and meaning--Such, more like,\r\nis a symbol of America.\r\n\r\nAfter all of which, returning to our starting-point, we reiterate, and\r\nin the whole Land's name, a welcome to our eminent guests. Visits like\r\ntheirs, and hospitalities, and hand-shaking, and face meeting face,\r\nand the distant brought near--what divine solvents they are! Travel,\r\nreciprocity, \"interviewing,\" intercommunion of lands--what are they\r\nbut Democracy's and the highest Law's best aids? O that our own\r\ncountry--that every land in the world--could annually, continually,\r\nreceive the poets, thinkers, scientists, even the official magnates, of\r\nother lands, as honor'd guests. O that the United States, especially the\r\nWest, could have had a good long visit and explorative jaunt, from\r\nthe noble and melancholy Tourguéneff, before he died--or from Victor\r\nHugo--or Thomas Carlyle. Castelar, Tennyson, any of the two or three\r\ngreat Parisian essayists--were they and we to come face to face, how is\r\nit possible but that the right understanding would ensue?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BIBLE AS POETRY\r\n\r\n\r\nI suppose one cannot at this day say anything new, from a literary point\r\nof view, about those autochthonic bequests of Asia--the Hebrew Bible,\r\nthe mighty Hindu epics, and a hundred lesser but typical works; (not\r\nnow definitely including the Iliad--though that work was certainly\r\nof Asiatic genesis, as Homer himself was--considerations which seem\r\ncuriously ignored.) But will there ever be a time or place--ever a\r\nstudent, however modern, of the grand art, to whom those compositions\r\nwill not afford profounder lessons than all else of their kind in the\r\ngarnerage of the past? Could there be any more opportune suggestion, to\r\nthe current popular writer and reader of verse, what the office of\r\npoet was in primeval times--and is yet capable of being, anew, adjusted\r\nentirely to the modern?\r\n\r\nAll the poems of Orientalism, with the Old and New Testaments at\r\nthe centre, tend to deep and wide, (I don't know but the deepest and\r\nwidest,) psychological development--with little, or nothing at all,\r\nof the mere esthetic, the principal verse-requirement of our day. Very\r\nlate, but unerringly, comes to every capable student the perception that\r\nit is not in beauty, it is not in art, it is not even in science,\r\nthat the profoundest laws of the case have their eternal sway and\r\noutcropping.\r\n\r\nIn his discourse on \"Hebrew Poets\" De Sola Mendes said: \"The fundamental\r\nfeature of Judaism, of the Hebrew nationality, was religion; its poetry\r\nwas naturally religious. Its subjects, God and Providence, the covenants\r\nwith Israel, God in Nature, and as reveal'd, God the Creator and\r\nGovernor, Nature in her majesty and beauty, inspired hymns and odes to\r\nNature's God. And then the checker'd history of the nation furnish'd\r\nallusions, illustrations, and subjects for epic display--the glory of\r\nthe sanctuary, the offerings, the splendid ritual, the Holy City, and\r\nlov'd Palestine with its pleasant valleys and wild tracts.\" Dr. Mendes\r\nsaid \"that rhyming was not a characteristic of Hebrew poetry at all.\r\nMetre was not a necessary mark of poetry. Great poets discarded it;\r\nthe early Jewish poets knew it not.\" Compared with the famed epics of\r\nGreece, and lesser ones since, the spinal supports of the Bible are\r\nsimple and meagre. All its history, biography, narratives, &c., are as\r\nbeads, strung on and indicating the eternal thread of the Deific purpose\r\nand power. Yet with only deepest faith for impetus, and such Deific\r\npurpose for palpable or impalpable theme, it often transcends the\r\nmasterpieces of Hellas, and all masterpieces.\r\n\r\nThe metaphors daring beyond account, the lawless soul, extravagant\r\nby our standards, the glow of love and friendship, the fervent\r\nkiss--nothing in argument or logic, but unsurpass'd in proverbs, in\r\nreligious ecstasy, in suggestions of common mortality and death, man's\r\ngreat equalizers--the spirit everything, the ceremonies and forms of the\r\nchurches nothing, faith limitless, its immense sensuousness immensely\r\nspiritual--an incredible, all-inclusive non-worldliness and dew-scented\r\nilliteracy (the antipodes of our Nineteenth Century business absorption\r\nand morbid refinement)--no hair-splitting doubts, no sickly sulking\r\nand sniffling, no \"Hamlet,\" no \"Adonais,\" no \"Thanatopsis,\" no \"In\r\nMemoriam.\"\r\n\r\nThe culminated proof of the poetry of a country is the quality of its\r\npersonnel, which, in any race, can never be really superior without\r\nsuperior poems. The finest blending of individuality with universality\r\n(in my opinion nothing out of the galaxies of the \"Iliad,\" or\r\nShakspere's heroes, or from the Tennysonian \"Idylls,\" so lofty, devoted\r\nand starlike,) typified in the songs of those old Asiatic lands. Men\r\nand women as great columnar trees. Nowhere else the abnegation of self\r\ntowering in such quaint sublimity; nowhere else the simplest human\r\nemotions conquering the gods of heaven, and fate itself. (The episode,\r\nfor instance, toward the close of the \"Mahabharata\"--the journey of the\r\nwife Savitri with the god of death, Yama,\r\n\r\n    \"One terrible to see--blood-red his garb,\r\n    His body huge and dark, bloodshot his eyes,\r\n    Which flamed like suns beneath his turban cloth,\r\n    Arm'd was he with a noose,\"\r\n\r\nwho carries off the soul of the dead husband, the wife tenaciously\r\nfollowing, and--by the resistless charm of perfect poetic\r\nrecitation!--eventually redeeming her captive mate.)\r\n\r\nI remember how enthusiastically William H. Seward, in his last days,\r\nonce expatiated on these themes, from his travels in Turkey, Egypt, and\r\nAsia Minor, finding the oldest Biblical narratives exactly illustrated\r\nthere to-day with apparently no break or change along three thousand\r\nyears--the veil'd women, the costumes, the gravity and simplicity, all\r\nthe manners just the same. The veteran Trelawney said he found the only\r\nreal _nobleman_ of the world in a good average specimen of the mid-aged\r\nor elderly Oriental. In the East the grand figure, always leading, is\r\nthe _old man_, majestic, with flowing beard, paternal, &c. In Europe and\r\nAmerica, it is, as we know, the young fellow--in novels, a handsome\r\nand interesting hero, more or less juvenile--in operas, a tenor with\r\nblooming cheeks, black mustache, superficial animation, and perhaps good\r\nlungs, but no more depth than skim-milk. But reading folks probably get\r\ntheir information of those Bible areas and current peoples, as depicted\r\nin print by English and French cads, the most shallow, impudent,\r\nsupercilious brood on earth.\r\n\r\nI have said nothing yet of the cumulus of associations (perfectly\r\nlegitimate parts of its influence, and finally in many respects the\r\ndominant parts,) of the Bible as a poetic entity, and of every portion\r\nof it. Not the old edifice only--the congeries also of events and\r\nstruggles and surroundings, of which it has been the scene and\r\nmotive--even the horrors, dreads, deaths. How many ages and generations\r\nhave brooded and wept and agonized over this book! What untellable joys\r\nand ecstasies--what support to martyrs at the stake--from it. (No really\r\ngreat song can ever attain full purport till long after the death of\r\nits singer--till it has accrued and incorporated the many passions, many\r\njoys and sorrows, it has itself arous'd.) To what myriads has it been\r\nthe shore and rock of safety--the refuge from driving tempest and wreck!\r\nTranslated in all languages, how it has united this diverse world! Of\r\ncivilized lands to-day, whose of our retrospects has it not interwoven\r\nand link'd and permeated? Not only does it bring us what is clasp'd\r\nwithin its covers; nay, that is the least of what it brings. Of its\r\nthousands, there is not a verse, not a word, but is thick-studded with\r\nhuman emotions, successions of fathers and sons, mothers and daughters,\r\nof our own antecedents, inseparable from that background of us,\r\non which, phantasmal as it is, all that we are to-day inevitably\r\ndepends--our ancestry, our past.\r\n\r\nStrange, but true, that the principal factor in cohering the nations,\r\neras and paradoxes of the globe, by giving them a common platform of\r\ntwo or three great ideas, a commonalty of origin, and projecting kosmic\r\nbrotherhood, the dream of all hope, all time--that the long trains\r\ngestations, attempts and failures, resulting in the New World, and in\r\nmodern solidarity and politics--are to be identified and resolv'd back\r\ninto a collection of old poetic lore, which, more than any one thing\r\nelse, has been the axis of civilization and history through thousands\r\nof years--and except for which this America of ours, with its polity and\r\nessentials, could not now be existing.\r\n\r\nNo true bard will ever contravene the Bible. If the time ever comes when\r\niconoclasm does its extremest in one direction against the Books of the\r\nBible in its present form, the collection must still survive in another,\r\nand dominate just as much as hitherto, or more than hitherto, through\r\nits divine and primal poetic structure. To me, that is the living and\r\ndefinite element-principle of the work, evolving everything else. Then\r\nthe continuity; the oldest and newest Asiatic utterance and character,\r\nand all between, holding together, like the apparition of the sky,\r\nand coming to us the same. Even to our Nineteenth Century here are the\r\nfountain heads of song.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFATHER TAYLOR (AND ORATORY)\r\n\r\n\r\nI have never heard but one essentially perfect orator--one who satisfied\r\nthose depths of the emotional nature that in most cases go through\r\nlife quite untouch'd, unfed--who held every hearer by spells which no\r\nconventionalist, high or low--nor any pride or composure, nor resistance\r\nof intellect--could stand against for ten minutes.\r\n\r\nAnd by the way, is it not strange, of this first-class genius in the\r\nrarest and most profound of humanity's arts, that it will be necessary,\r\n(so nearly forgotten and rubb'd out is his name by the rushing whirl of\r\nthe last twenty-five years,) to first inform current readers that he was\r\nan orthodox minister, of no particular celebrity, who during a long life\r\npreach'd especially to Yankee sailors in an old fourth-class church down\r\nby the wharves in Boston--had practically been a seafaring man through\r\nhis earlier years--and died April 6, 1871, \"just as the tide turn'd,\r\ngoing out with the ebb as an old salt should\"? His name is now\r\ncomparatively unknown, outside of Boston--and even there, (though\r\nDickens, Mr. Jameson, Dr. Bartol and Bishop Haven have commemorated\r\nhim,) is mostly but a reminiscence.\r\n\r\nDuring my visits to \"the Hub,\" in 1859 and '60 I several times saw and\r\nheard Father Taylor. In the spring or autumn, quiet Sunday forenoons, I\r\nliked to go down early to the quaint ship-cabin-looking church where the\r\nold man minister'd--to enter and leisurely scan the building, the low\r\nceiling, everything strongly timber'd (polish'd and rubb'd apparently,)\r\nthe dark rich colors, the gallery, all in half-light--and smell the\r\naroma of old wood--to watch the auditors, sailors, mates, \"matlows,\"\r\nofficers, singly or in groups, as they came in--their physiognomies,\r\nforms, dress, gait, as they walk'd along the aisles--their postures,\r\nseating themselves in the rude, roomy, undoor'd, uncushion'd pews--and\r\nthe evident effect upon them of the place, occasion, and atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe pulpit, rising ten or twelve feet high, against the rear wall, was\r\nback' d by a significant mural painting, in oil--showing out its bold\r\nlines and strong hues through the subdued light of the building--of a\r\nstormy sea, the waves high-rolling, and amid them an old-style ship,\r\nall bent over, driving through the gale, and in great peril--a vivid\r\nand effectual piece of limning, not meant for the criticism of artists\r\n(though I think it had merit even from that standpoint,) but for its\r\neffect upon the congregation, and what it would convey to them.\r\n\r\nFather Taylor was a moderate-sized man, indeed almost small, (reminded\r\nme of old Booth, the great actor, and my favorite of those and preceding\r\ndays,) well advanced in years, but alert, with mild blue or gray eyes,\r\nand good presence and voice. Soon as he open'd his mouth I ceas'd to pay\r\nany attention to church or audience, or pictures or lights and shades;\r\na far more potent charm entirely sway'd me. In the course of the sermon,\r\n(there was no sign of any MS., or reading from notes,) some of the parts\r\nwould be in the highest degree majestic and picturesque. Colloquial in a\r\nsevere sense, it often lean'd to Biblical and Oriental forms. Especially\r\nwere all allusions to ships and the ocean and sailors' lives, of\r\nunrival'd power and life-likeness.\r\n\r\nSometimes there were passages of fine language and composition, even\r\nfrom the purist's point of view. A few arguments, and of the best, but\r\nalways brief and simple. One realized what grip there might have been in\r\nsuch words-of-mouth talk as that of Socrates and Epictetus. In the main,\r\nI should say, of any of these discourses, that the old Demosthenean rule\r\nand requirement of \"action, action, action,\" first in its inward and\r\nthen (very moderate and restrain'd) its outward sense, was the quality\r\nthat had leading fulfilment.\r\n\r\nI remember I felt the deepest impression from the old man's prayers,\r\nwhich invariably affected me to tears. Never, on similar or any other\r\noccasions, have I heard such impassion'd pleading--such human-harassing\r\nreproach (like Hamlet to his mother, in the closet)--such probing to\r\nthe very depths of that latent conscience and remorse which probably lie\r\nsomewhere in the background of every life, every soul. For when Father\r\nTaylor preach'd or pray'd, the rhetoric and art, the mere words, (which\r\nusually play such a big part) seem'd altogether to disappear, and the\r\n_live feeling_ advanced upon you and seiz'd you with a power before\r\nunknown. Everybody felt this marvellous and awful influence. One young\r\nsailor, a Rhode Islander, (who came every Sunday, and I got acquainted\r\nwith, and talk'd to once or twice as we went away,) told me, \"that must\r\nbe the Holy Ghost we read of in the Testament.\"\r\n\r\nI should be at a loss to make any comparison with other preachers or\r\npublic speakers. When a child I had heard Elias Hicks--and Father Taylor\r\n(though so different in personal appearance, for Elias was of tall and\r\nmost shapely form, with black eyes that blazed at times like meteors,)\r\nalways reminded me of him. Both had the same inner, apparently\r\ninexhaustible, fund of latent volcanic passion--the same tenderness,\r\nblended with a curious remorseless firmness, as of some surgeon\r\noperating on a belov'd patient. Hearing such men sends to the winds all\r\nthe books, and formulas, and polish'd speaking, and rules of oratory.\r\n\r\nTalking of oratory, why is it that the unsophisticated practices often\r\nstrike deeper than the train'd ones? Why do our experiences perhaps of\r\nsome local country exhorter--or often in the West or South at political\r\nmeetings--bring the most definite results? In my time I have heard\r\nWebster, Clay, Edward Everett, Phillips, and such _célébrès_ yet I\r\nrecall the minor but life-eloquence of men like John P. Hale, Cassius\r\nClay, and one or two of the old abolition \"fanatics\" ahead of all those\r\nstereotyped fames. Is not--I sometimes question--the first, last, and\r\nmost important quality of all, in training for a \"finish'd speaker,\"\r\ngenerally unsought, unreck'd of, both by teacher and pupil? Though\r\nmay-be it cannot be taught, anyhow. At any rate, we need to clearly\r\nunderstand the distinction between oratory and elocution. Under the\r\nlatter art, including some of high order, there is indeed no scarcity in\r\nthe United States, preachers, lawyers, actors, lecturers, &c. With all,\r\nthere seem to be few real orators--almost none.\r\n\r\nI repeat, and would dwell upon it (more as suggestion than mere\r\nfact)--among all the brilliant lights of bar or stage I have heard in\r\nmy time (for years in New York and other cities I haunted the courts\r\nto witness notable trials, and have heard all the famous actors and\r\nactresses that have been in America the past fifty years) though\r\nI recall marvellous effects from one or other of them, I never had\r\nanything in the way of vocal utterance to shake me through and through,\r\nand become fix'd, with its accompaniments, in my memory, like those\r\nprayers and sermons--like Father Taylor's personal electricity and the\r\nwhole scene there--the prone ship in the gale, and dashing wave and foam\r\nfor background--in the little old sea-church in Boston, those summer\r\nSundays just before the secession war broke out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPANISH ELEMENT IN OUR NATIONALITY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Our friends at Santa Fe, New Mexico, have just finish'd their\r\nlong-drawn-out anniversary of the 333d year of the settlement of their\r\ncity by the Spanish. The good, gray Walt Whitman was asked to write\r\nthem a poem in commemoration. Instead he wrote them a letter as\r\nfollows:--_Philadelphia Press_, August 5, 1883.]\r\n\r\nCAMDEN, NEW JERSEY, _July 20, 1883_.\r\n\r\n_To Messrs. Griffin, Martinez, Prince, and other Gentlemen at Santa Fé_:\r\n\r\nDEAR SIRS:--Your kind invitation to visit you and deliver a poem for the\r\n333d Anniversary of founding Santa Fé has reach'd me so late that I have\r\nto decline, with sincere regret. But I will say a few words offhand.\r\n\r\nWe Americans have yet to really learn our own antecedents, and sort\r\nthem, to unify them. They will be found ampler than has been supposed,\r\nand in widely different sources. Thus far, impress'd by New England\r\nwriters and schoolmasters, we tacitly abandon ourselves to the notion\r\nthat our United States have been fashion'd from the British Islands\r\nonly, and essentially form a second England only--which is a very great\r\nmistake. Many leading traits for our future national personality, and\r\nsome of the best ones, will certainly prove to have originated from\r\nother than British stock. As it is, the British and German, valuable as\r\nthey are in the concrete, already threaten excess. Or rather, I should\r\nsay, they have certainly reach'd that excess. To-day, something outside\r\nof them, and to counterbalance them, is seriously needed.\r\n\r\nThe seething materialistic and business vortices of the United States,\r\nin their present devouring relations, controlling and belittling\r\neverything else, are, in my opinion, but a vast and indispensable stage\r\nin the new world's development, and are certainly to be follow'd\r\nby something entirely different--at least by immense modifications.\r\nCharacter, literature, a society worthy the name, are yet to be\r\nestablish'd, through a nationality of noblest spiritual, heroic\r\nand democratic attributes--not one of which at present definitely\r\nexists--entirely different from the past, though unerringly founded on\r\nit, and to justify it.\r\n\r\nTo that composite American identity of the future, Spanish character\r\nwill supply some of the most needed parts. No stock shows a grander\r\nhistoric retrospect--grander in religiousness and loyalty, or for\r\npatriotism, courage, decorum, gravity and honor. (It is time to dismiss\r\nutterly the illusion-compound, half raw-head-and-bloody-bones and half\r\nMysteries-of-Udolpho, inherited from the English writers of the past 200\r\nyears. It is time to realize--for it is certainly true--that there\r\nwill not be found any more cruelty, tyranny, superstition, &c., in the\r\n_résumé_ of past Spanish history than in the corresponding _résumé_ of\r\nAnglo-Norman history. Nay, I think there will not be found so much.)\r\n\r\nThen another point, relating to American ethnology, past and to come,\r\nI will here touch upon at a venture. As to our aboriginal or Indian\r\npopulation--the Aztec in the South, and many a tribe in the North and\r\nWest--I know it seems to be agreed that they must gradually dwindle as\r\ntime rolls on, and in a few generations more leave only a reminiscence,\r\na blank. But I am not at all clear about that. As America, from its\r\nmany far-back sources and current supplies, develops, adapts, entwines,\r\nfaithfully identifies its own--are we to see it cheerfully accepting\r\nand using all the contributions of foreign lands from the whole outside\r\nglobe--and then rejecting the only ones distinctively its own--the\r\nautochthonic ones?\r\n\r\nAs to the Spanish stock of our Southwest, it is certain to me that we\r\ndo not begin to appreciate the splendor and sterling value of its\r\nrace element. Who knows but that element, like the course of some\r\nsubterranean river, dipping invisibly for a hundred or two years, is now\r\nto emerge in broadest flow and permanent action?\r\n\r\nIf I might assume to do so, I would like to send you the most cordial,\r\nheartfelt congratulations of your American fellow-countrymen here. You\r\nhave more friends in the Northern and Atlantic regions than you\r\nsuppose, and they are deeply interested in the development of the great\r\nSouthwestern interior, and in what your festival would arouse to public\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully, &c.,\r\n\r\nWALT WHITMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT LURKS BEHIND SHAKSPERE'S HISTORICAL PLAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe all know how much _mythus_ there is in the Shakspere question as it\r\nstands to-day. Beneath a few foundations of proved facts are\r\ncertainly engulf d far more dim and elusive ones, of deepest\r\nimportance--tantalizing and half suspected--suggesting explanations that\r\none dare not put in plain statement. But coming at once to the point,\r\nthe English historical plays are to me not only the most eminent as\r\ndramatic performances (my maturest judgment confirming the impressions\r\nof my early years, that the distinctiveness and glory of the Poet reside\r\nnot in his vaunted dramas of the passions, but those founded on the\r\ncontests of English dynasties, and the French wars,) but form, as we\r\nget it all, the chief in a complexity of puzzles. Conceiv'd out of\r\nthe fullest heat and pulse of European feudalism--personifying in\r\nunparallel'd ways the mediaeval aristocracy, its towering spirit of\r\nruthless and gigantic caste, with its own peculiar air and arrogance\r\n(no mere imitation)--only one of the \"wolfish earls\" so plenteous in the\r\nplays themselves, or some born descendant and knower, might seem to be\r\nthe true author of those amazing works--works in some respects greater\r\nthan anything else in recorded literature.\r\n\r\nThe start and germ-stock of the pieces on which the present speculation\r\nis founded are undoubtedly (with, at the outset, no small amount of\r\nbungling work) in \"Henry VI.\" It is plain to me that as profound and\r\nforecasting a brain and pen as ever appear'd in literature, after\r\nfloundering somewhat in the first part of that trilogy--or perhaps\r\ndraughting it more or less experimentally or by accident--afterward\r\ndeveloped and defined his plan in the Second and Third Parts, and from\r\ntime to time, thenceforward, systematically enlarged it to majestic and\r\nmature proportions in \"Richard II,\" \"Richard III,\" \"King John,\" \"Henry\r\nIV,\" \"Henry V,\" and even in \"Macbeth,\" \"Coriolanus\" and \"Lear.\" For it\r\nis impossible to grasp the whole cluster of those plays, however wide\r\nthe intervals and different circumstances of their composition, without\r\nthinking of them as, in a free sense, the result of an _essentially\r\ncontroling plan_. 'What was that plan? Or, rather, what was veil'd\r\nbehind it?--for to me there was certainly something so veil'd. Even the\r\nepisodes of Cade, Joan of Arc, and the like (which sometimes seem to me\r\nlike interpolations allow'd,) may be meant to foil the possible sleuth,\r\nand throw any too 'cute pursuer off the scent. In the whole matter I\r\nshould specially dwell on, and make much of, that inexplicable element\r\nof every highest poetic nature which causes it to cover up and involve\r\nits real purpose and meanings in folded removes and far recesses. Of\r\nthis trait--hiding the nest where common seekers may never find it--the\r\nShaksperean works afford the most numerous and mark'd illustrations\r\nknown to me. I would even call that trait the leading one through the\r\nwhole of those works.\r\n\r\nAll the foregoing to premise a brief statement of how and where I get my\r\nnew light on Shakspere. Speaking of the special English plays, my friend\r\nWilliam O'Connor says:\r\n\r\n  They seem simply and rudely historical in their motive, as aiming\r\n  to give in the rough a tableau of warring dynasties,--and carry to\r\n  me a lurking sense of being in aid of some ulterior design, probably\r\n  well enough understood in that age, which perhaps time and criticism\r\n  will reveal.... Their atmosphere is one of barbarous and tumultuous\r\n  gloom,--they do not make us love the times they limn,... and it is\r\n  impossible to believe that the greatest of the Elizabethan men could\r\n  have sought to indoctrinate the age with the love of feudalism which\r\n  his own drama in its entirety, if the view taken of it herein be true,\r\n  certainly and subtly saps and mines.\r\n\r\nReading the just-specified play in the light of Mr. O'Connor's\r\nsuggestion, I defy any one to escape such new and deep\r\nutterance-meanings, like magic ink, warm' d by the fire, and previously\r\ninvisible. Will it not indeed be strange if the author of \"Othello\" and\r\n\"Hamlet\" is destin'd to live in America, in a generation or two, less as\r\nthe cunning draughtsman of the passions, and more as putting on record\r\nthe first full exposé--and by far the most vivid one, immeasurably ahead\r\nof doctrinaires and economists--of the political theory and results, or\r\nthe reason-why and necessity for them which America has come on earth to\r\nabnegate and replace?\r\n\r\nThe summary of my suggestion would be, therefore, that while the more\r\nthe rich and tangled jungle of the Shaksperean area is travers'd and\r\nstudied, and the more baffled and mix'd, as so far appears, becomes the\r\nexploring student (who at last surmises everything, and remains certain\r\nof nothing,) it is possible a future age of criticism, diving deeper,\r\nmapping the land and lines freer, completer than hitherto, may discover\r\nin the plays named the scientific (Baconian?) inauguration of modern\r\ndemocracy--furnishing realistic and first-class artistic portraitures\r\nof the mediaeval world, the feudal personalities, institutes, in their\r\nmorbid accumulations, deposits, upon politics and sociology,--may\r\npenetrate to that hard-pan, far down and back of the ostent of to-day,\r\non which (and on which only) the progressism of the last two centuries\r\nhas built this Democracy which now hold's secure lodgment over the whole\r\ncivilized world.\r\n\r\nWhether such was the unconscious, or (as I think likely) the more\r\nor less conscious, purpose of him who fashion'd those marvellous\r\narchitectonics, is a secondary question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA THOUGHT ON SHAKSPERE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most distinctive poems--the most permanently rooted and with\r\nheartiest reason for being--the copious cycle of Arthurian legends, or\r\nthe almost equally copious Charlemagne cycle, or the poems of the Cid,\r\nor Scandinavian Eddas, or Nibelungen, or Chaucer, or Spenser, or _bona\r\nfide_ Ossian, or Inferno--probably had their rise in the great historic\r\nperturbations, which they came in to sum up and confirm, indirectly\r\nembodying results to date. Then however precious to \"culture,\" the\r\ngrandest of those poems, it may be said, preserve and typify results\r\noffensive to the modern spirit, and long past away. To state it briefly,\r\nand taking the strongest examples, in Homer lives the ruthless military\r\nprowess of Greece, and of its special god-descended dynastic houses;\r\nin Shakspere the dragon-rancors and stormy feudal Splendor of mediaeval\r\ncaste.\r\n\r\nPoetry, largely consider'd, is an evolution, sending out improved\r\nand-ever-expanded types--in one sense, the past, even the best of it,\r\nnecessarily giving place, and dying out. For our existing world,\r\nthe bases on which all the grand old poems were built have become\r\nvacuums--and even those of many comparatively modern ones are broken and\r\nhalf-gone. For us to-day, not their own intrinsic value, vast as that\r\nis, backs and maintains those poems--but a mountain-high growth of\r\nassociations, the layers of successive ages. Everywhere--their own lands\r\nincluded--(is there not something terrible in the tenacity with which\r\nthe one book out of millions holds its grip?)--the Homeric and Virgilian\r\nworks, the interminable ballad-romances of the middle ages, the\r\nutterances of Dante, Spenser, and others, are upheld by their\r\ncumulus-entrenchment in scholarship, and as precious, always welcome,\r\nunspeakably valuable reminiscences.\r\n\r\nEven the one who at present reigns unquestion'd--of Shakspere--for all\r\nhe stands for so much in modern literature, he stands entirely for\r\nthe mighty esthetic sceptres of the past, not for the spiritual\r\nand democratic, the sceptres of the future. The inward and outward\r\ncharacteristics of Shakspere are his vast and rich variety of persons\r\nand themes, with his wondrous delineation of each and all,--not only\r\nlimitless funds of verbal and pictorial resource, but great excess,\r\nsuperfoetation--mannerism, like a fine, aristocratic perfume, holding\r\na touch of musk (Euphues, his mark)--with boundless sumptuousness and\r\nadornment, real velvet and gems, not shoddy nor paste--but a good deal\r\nof bombast and fustian--(certainly some terrific mouthing in Shakspere!)\r\n\r\nSuperb and inimitable as all is, it is mostly an objective and\r\nphysiological kind of power and beauty the soul finds in Shakspere--a\r\nstyle supremely grand of the sort, but in my opinion stopping short of\r\nthe grandest sort, at any rate for fulfilling and satisfying modern and\r\nscientific and democratic American purposes. Think, not of growths as\r\nforests primeval, or Yellowstone geysers, or Colorado ravines, but of\r\ncostly marble palaces, and palace rooms, and the noblest fixings and\r\nfurniture, and noble owners and occupants to correspond--think of\r\ncarefully built gardens from the beautiful but sophisticated gardening\r\nart at its best, with walks and bowers and artificial lakes, and\r\nappropriate statue-groups and the finest cultivated roses and lilies\r\nand japonicas in plenty--and you have the tally of Shakspere. The\r\nlow characters, mechanics, even the loyal henchmen--all in themselves\r\nnothing--serve as capital foils to the aristocracy. The comedies\r\n(exquisite as they certainly are) bringing in admirably portray'd common\r\ncharacters, have the unmistakable hue of plays, portraits, made for the\r\ndivertisement only of the élite of the castle, and from its point\r\nof view. The comedies are altogether non-acceptable to America and\r\nDemocracy.\r\n\r\nBut to the deepest soul, it seems a shame to pick and choose from\r\nthe riches Shakspere has left us--to criticise his infinitely royal,\r\nmultiform quality--to gauge, with optic glasses, the dazzle of his\r\nsun-like beams.\r\n\r\nThe best poetic utterance, after all, can merely hint, or remind, often\r\nvery indirectly, or at distant removes. Aught of real perfection, or the\r\nsolution of any deep problem, or any completed statement of the moral,\r\nthe true, the beautiful, eludes the greatest, deftest poet--flies away\r\nlike an always uncaught bird.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT BURNS AS POET AND PERSON\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat the future will decide about Robert Burns and his works--what place\r\nwill be assign'd them on that great roster of geniuses and genius which\r\ncan only be finish'd by the slow but sure balancing of the centuries\r\nwith their ample average--I of course cannot tell. But as we know him,\r\nfrom his recorded utterances, and after nearly one century, and its\r\ndiligence of collections, songs, letters, anecdotes, presenting the\r\nfigure of the canny Scotchman in a fullness and detail wonderfully\r\ncomplete, and the lines mainly by his own hand, he forms to-day, in some\r\nrespects, the most interesting personality among singers. Then there are\r\nmany things in Burns's poems and character that specially endear him to\r\nAmerica. He was essentially a Republican--would have been at home in\r\nthe Western United States, and probably become eminent there. He was\r\nan average sample of the good-natured, warm-blooded, proud-spirited,\r\namative, alimentive, convivial, young and early-middle-aged man of the\r\ndecent-born middle classes everywhere and any how. Without the race of\r\nwhich he is a distinct specimen, (and perhaps his poems) America and\r\nher powerful Democracy could not exist to-day--could not project with\r\nunparallel'd historic sway into the future.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the peculiar coloring of the era of Burns needs always first\r\nto be consider'd. It included the times of the '76-'83 Revolution in\r\nAmerica, of the French Revolution, and an unparallel'd chaos development\r\nin Europe and elsewhere. In every department, shining and strange names,\r\nlike stars, some rising, some in meridian, some declining--Voltaire,\r\nFranklin, Washington, Kant, Goethe, Fulton, Napoleon, mark the era.\r\nAnd while so much, and of grandest moment, fit for the trumpet of the\r\nworld's fame, was being transacted--that little tragi-comedy of R. B,'s\r\nlife and death was going on in a country by-place in Scotland!\r\n\r\nBurns's correspondence, generally collected and publish'd since his\r\ndeath, gives wonderful glints into both the amiable and weak (and worse\r\nthan weak) parts of his portraiture, habits, good and bad luck, ambition\r\nand associations. His letters to Mrs. Dunlop, Mrs. McLehose, (Clarinda,)\r\nMr. Thompson, Dr. Moore, Robert Muir, Mr. Cunningham, Miss Margaret\r\nChalmers, Peter Hill, Richard Brown, Mrs. Riddel, Robert Ainslie, and\r\nRobert Graham, afford valuable lights and shades to the outline, and\r\nwith numerous others, help to a touch here, and fill-in there, of\r\npoet and poems. There are suspicions, it is true, of \"the Genteel\r\nLetter-Writer,\" with scraps and words from \"the Manual of French\r\nQuotations,\" and, in the love-letters, some hollow mouthings. Yet we\r\nwouldn't on any account lack the letters. A full and true portrait is\r\nalways what is wanted; veracity at every hazard. Besides, do we not\r\nall see by this time that the story of Burns, even for its own sake,\r\nrequires the record of the whole and several, with nothing left out?\r\nCompletely and every point minutely told out its fullest, explains and\r\njustifies itself--(as perhaps almost any life does.) He is very close\r\nto the earth. He pick'd up his best words and tunes directly from the\r\nScotch home-singers, but tells Thompson they would not please his, T.'s,\r\n\"learn'd lugs,\" adding, \"I call them simple--you would pronounce them\r\nsilly.\" Yes, indeed; the idiom was undoubtedly his happiest hit. Yet\r\nDr. Moore, in 1789, writes to Burns, \"If I were to offer an opinion, it\r\nwould be that in your future productions you should abandon the Scotch\r\nstanza and dialect, and adopt the measure and language of modern English\r\npoetry\"!\r\n\r\nAs the 128th birth-anniversary of the poet draws on, (January, 1887,)\r\nwith its increasing club-suppers, vehement celebrations, letters,\r\nspeeches, and so on--(mostly, as William O'Connor says, from people who\r\nwould not have noticed R. B. at all during his actual life, nor kept\r\nhis company, or read his verses, on any account)--it may be opportune\r\nto print some leisurely-jotted notes I find in my budget. I take my\r\nobservation of the Scottish bard by considering him as an individual\r\namid the crowded clusters, galaxies, of the old world--and fairly\r\ninquiring and suggesting what out of these myriads he too may be to\r\nthe Western Republic. In the first place no poet on record so fully\r\nbequeaths his own personal magnetism,[39] nor illustrates more pointedly\r\nhow one's verses, by time and reading, can so curiously fuse with the\r\nversifier's own life and death, and give final light and shade to all.\r\n\r\nI would say a large part of the fascination of Burns's homely, simple\r\ndialect-melodies is due, for all current and future readers, to\r\nthe poet's personal \"errors,\" the general bleakness of his lot, his\r\ningrain'd pensiveness, his brief dash into dazzling, tantalizing,\r\nevanescent sunshine--finally culminating in those last years of\r\nhis life, his being taboo'd and in debt, sick and sore, yaw'd as by\r\ncontending gales, deeply dissatisfied with everything, most of all with\r\nhimself--high-spirited too--(no man ever really higher-spirited than\r\nRobert Burns.) I think it a perfectly legitimate part too. At any rate\r\nit has come to be an impalpable aroma through which only both the songs\r\nand their singer must henceforth be read and absorb'd. Through that\r\nview-medium of misfortune--of a noble spirit in low environments, and of\r\na squalid and premature death--we view the undoubted facts, (giving, as\r\nwe read them now, a sad kind of pungency,) that Burns's were, before all\r\nelse, the lyrics of illicit loves and carousing intoxication. Perhaps\r\neven it is this strange, impalpable _post-mortem_ comment and influence\r\nreferr'd to, that gives them their contrast, attraction, making the\r\nzest of their author's after fame. If he had lived steady, fat, moral,\r\ncomfortable, well-to-do years, on his own grade, (let alone, what of\r\ncourse was out of the question, the ease and velvet and rosewood and\r\ncopious royalties of Tennyson or Victor Hugo or Longfellow,) and died\r\nwell-ripen'd and respectable, where could have come in that burst\r\nof passionate sobbing and remorse which well'd forth instantly\r\nand generally in Scotland, and soon follow'd everywhere among\r\nEnglish-speaking races, on the announcement of his death? and which,\r\nwith no sign of stopping, only regulated and vein'd with fitting\r\nappreciation, flows deeply, widely yet?\r\n\r\nDear Rob! manly, witty, fond, friendly, full of weak spots as well as\r\nstrong ones-essential type of so many thousands--perhaps the average, as\r\njust said, of the decent-born young men and the early mid-aged, not only\r\nof the British Isles, but America, too, North and South, just the same.\r\nI think, indeed, one best part of Burns is the unquestionable proof\r\nhe presents of the perennial existence among the laboring classes,\r\nespecially farmers, of the finest latent poetic elements in their blood.\r\n(How clear it is to me that the common soil has always been, and is now,\r\nthickly strewn with just such gems.) He is well-called the _Ploughman_.\r\n\"Holding the plough,\" said his brother Gilbert, \"was the favorite\r\nsituation with Robert for poetic compositions; and some of his best\r\nverses were produced while he was at that exercise.\" \"I must return\r\nto my humble station, and woo my rustic muse in my wonted way, at the\r\nplough-tail.\" 1787, to the Earl of Buchan. He has no high ideal of the\r\npoet or the poet's office; indeed quite a low and contracted notion of\r\nboth:\r\n\r\n    \"Fortune! if thou'll but gie me still\r\n    Hale breeks, a scone, and whiskey gill,\r\n    An' rowth o' rhyme to rave at will,\r\n    Tak' a' the rest.\"\r\n\r\nSee also his rhym'd letters to Robert Graham invoking patronage; \"one\r\nstronghold,\" Lord Glencairn, being dead, now these appeals to \"Fintra,\r\nmy other stay,\" (with in one letter a copious shower of vituperation\r\ngenerally.) In his collected poems there is no particular unity, nothing\r\nthat can be called a leading theory, no unmistakable spine or skeleton.\r\nPerhaps, indeed, their very desultoriness is the charm of his songs: \"I\r\ntake up one or another,\" he says in a letter to Thompson, \"just as the\r\nbee of the moment buzzes in my bonnet-lug.\"\r\n\r\nConsonantly with the customs of the time--yet markedly inconsistent in\r\nspirit with Burns's own case, (and not a little painful as it remains\r\non record, as depicting some features of the bard himself,) the relation\r\ncalled _patronage_ existed between the nobility and gentry on one\r\nside, and literary people on the other, and gives one of the strongest\r\nside-lights to the general coloring of poems and poets. It crops out a\r\ngood deal in Burns's Letters, and even necessitated a certain flunkeyism\r\non occasions, through life. It probably, with its requirements, (while\r\nit help'd in money and countenance) did as much as any one cause in\r\nmaking that life a chafed and unhappy one, ended by a premature and\r\nmiserable death.\r\n\r\nYes, there is something about Burns peculiarly acceptable to the\r\nconcrete, human points of view. He poetizes work-a-day agricultural\r\nlabor and life, (whose spirit and sympathies, as well as practicalities,\r\nare much the same everywhere,) and treats fresh, often coarse, natural\r\noccurrences, loves, persons, not like many new and some old poets in a\r\ngenteel style of gilt and china, or at second or third removes, but in\r\ntheir own born atmosphere, laughter, sweat, unction. Perhaps no one ever\r\nsang \"lads and lasses\"--that universal race, mainly the same, too, all\r\nages, all lands--down on their own plane, as he has. He exhibits\r\nno philosophy worth mentioning; his morality is hardly more than\r\nparrot-talk--not bad or deficient, but cheap, shopworn, the platitudes\r\nof old aunts and uncles to the youngsters (be good boys and keep your\r\nnoses clean.) Only when he gets at Poosie Nansie's, celebrating the\r\n\"barley bree,\" or among tramps, or democratic bouts and drinking\r\ngenerally,\r\n\r\n    (\"Freedom and whiskey gang the gither.\")\r\n\r\nwe have, in his own unmistakable color and warmth, those interiors\r\nof rake-helly life and tavern fun--the cantabile of jolly beggars in\r\nhighest jinks--lights and groupings of rank glee and brawny amorousness,\r\noutvying the best painted pictures of the Dutch school, or any school.\r\n\r\nBy America and her democracy such a poet, I cannot too often repeat,\r\nmust be kept in loving remembrance; but it is best that discriminations\r\nbe made. His admirers (as at those anniversary suppers, over the \"hot\r\nScotch\") will not accept for their favorite anything less than the\r\nhighest rank, alongside of Homer, Shakspere, etc. Such, in candor, are\r\nnot the true friends of the Ayrshire bard, who really needs a different\r\nplace quite by himself. The Iliad and the Odyssey express courage,\r\ncraft, full-grown heroism in situations of danger, the sense of command\r\nand leadership, emulation, the last and fullest evolution of self-poise\r\nas in kings, and god-like even while animal appetites. The Shaksperean\r\ncompositions, on vertebers and frame-work of the primary passions,\r\nportray (essentially the same as Homer's,) the spirit and letter of the\r\nfeudal world, the Norman lord, ambitious and arrogant, taller and\r\nnobler than common men--with much underplay and gusts of heat and cold,\r\nvolcanoes and stormy seas. Burns (and some will say to his credit)\r\nattempts none of these themes. He poetizes the humor, riotous blood,\r\nsulks, amorous torments, fondness for the tavern and for cheap objective\r\nnature, with disgust at the grim and narrow ecclesiasticism of his\r\ntime and land, of a young farmer on a bleak and hired farm in Scotland,\r\nthrough the years and under the circumstances of the British politics\r\nof that time, and of his short personal career as author, from 1783 to\r\n1796. He is intuitive and affectionate, and just emerged or emerging\r\nfrom the shackles of the kirk, from poverty, ignorance, and from his\r\nown rank appetites--(out of which latter, however, he never extricated\r\nhimself.) It is to be said that amid not a little smoke and gas in his\r\npoems, there is in almost every piece a spark of fire, and now and then\r\nthe real afflatus. He has been applauded as democratic, and with some\r\nwarrant; while Shakspere, and with the greatest warrant, has been called\r\nmonarchical or aristocratic (which he certainly is.) But the splendid\r\npersonalizations of Shakspere, formulated on the largest, freest, most\r\nheroic, most artistic mould, are to me far dearer as lessons, and more\r\nprecious even as models for Democracy, than the humdrum samples\r\nBurns presents. The motives of some of his effusions are certainly\r\ndiscreditable personally--one or two of them markedly so. He has,\r\nmoreover, little or no spirituality. This last is his mortal flaw and\r\ndefect, tried by highest standards. The ideal he never reach'd (and yet\r\nI think he leads the way to it.) He gives melodies, and now and then the\r\nsimplest and sweetest ones; but harmonies, complications, oratorios in\r\nwords, never. (I do not speak this in any deprecatory sense. Blessed be\r\nthe memory of the warm-hearted Scotchman for what he has left us, just\r\nas it is!) He likewise did not know himself, in more ways than one.\r\nThough so really fret and independent, he prided himself in his songs on\r\nbeing a reactionist and a Jacobite--on persistent sentimental adherency\r\nto the cause of the Stuarts--the weakest, thinnest, most faithless,\r\nbrainless dynasty that ever held a throne.\r\n\r\nThus, while Burns is not at all great for New World study, in the\r\nsense that Isaiah and Eschylus and the book of Job are unquestionably\r\ngreat--is not to be mention'd with Shakspere--hardly even with current\r\nTennyson or our Emerson--he has a nestling niche of his own, all\r\nfragrant, fond, and quaint and homely--a lodge built near but outside\r\nthe mighty temple of the gods of song and art--those universal strivers,\r\nthrough their works of harmony and melody and power, to ever show or\r\nintimate man's crowning, last, victorious fusion in himself of Real\r\nand Ideal. Precious, too--fit and precious beyond all singers, high\r\nor low--will Burns ever be to the native Scotch, especially to the\r\nworking-classes of North Britain; so intensely one of them, and so racy\r\nof the soil, sights, and local customs. He often apostrophizes Scotland,\r\nand is, or would be, enthusiastically patriotic. His country has lately\r\ncommemorated him in a statue.[40] His aim is declaredly to be 'a Rustic\r\nBard.' His poems were all written in youth or young manhood, (he was\r\nlittle more than a young man when he died.) His collected works in\r\ngiving everything, are nearly one half first drafts. His brightest hit\r\nis his use of the Scotch patois, so full of terms flavor'd like wild\r\nfruits or berries. Then I should make an allowance to Burns which cannot\r\nbe made for any other poet. Curiously even the frequent crudeness,\r\nhaste, deficiencies, (flatness and puerilities by no means absent) prove\r\nupon the whole not out of keeping in any comprehensive collection of\r\nhis works, heroically printed, \"following copy,\" every piece, every line\r\naccording to originals. Other poets might tremble for such boldness,\r\nsuch rawness. In \"this odd-kind chiel\" such points hardly mar the\r\nrest. Not only are they in consonance with the underlying spirit of the\r\npieces, but complete the full abandon and veracity of the farm-fields\r\nand the home-brew'd flavor of the Scotch vernacular. (Is there not\r\noften something in the very neglect, unfinish, careless nudity, slovenly\r\nhiatus, coming from intrinsic genius, and not \"put on,\" that secretly\r\npleases the soul more than the wrought and re-wrought polish of the most\r\nperfect verse?) Mark the native spice and untranslatable twang in the\r\nvery names of his songs-\"O for ane and twenty, Tam,\" \"John Barleycorn,\"\r\n\"Last May a braw Wooer,\" \"Rattlin roarin Willie,\" \"O wert thou in the\r\ncauld, cauld blast,\" \"Gude e'en to you, Kimmer,\" \"Merry hae I been\r\nteething a Heckle,\" \"O lay thy loof in mine, lass,\" and others.\r\n\r\nThe longer and more elaborated poems of Burns are just such as would\r\nplease a natural but homely taste, and cute but average intellect, and\r\nare inimitable in their way. The \"Twa Dogs,\" (one of the best) with the\r\nconversation between Cesar and Luath, the \"Brigs of Ayr,\" \"the Cotter's\r\nSaturday Night,\" \"Tam O'Shanter\"--all will be long read and re-read and\r\nadmired, and ever deserve to be. With nothing profound in any of them,\r\nwhat there is of moral and plot has an inimitably fresh and racy flavor.\r\nIf it came to question, Literature could well afford to send adrift many\r\na pretensive poem, and even book of poems, before it could spare these\r\ncompositions.\r\n\r\nNever indeed was there truer utterance in a certain range of\r\nidiosyncrasy than by this poet. Hardly a piece of his, large or small,\r\nbut has \"snap\" and raciness. He puts in cantering rhyme (often\r\ndoggerel) much cutting irony and idiomatic ear-cuffing of the\r\nkirk-deacons--drilygood-natured addresses to his cronies, (he certainly\r\nwould not stop us if he were here this moment, from classing that\r\n\"to the De'il\" among them)--\"to Mailie and her Lambs,\" \"to auld Mare\r\nMaggie,\" \"to a Mouse,\"\r\n\r\n    \"Wee, sleekit, cowrin, tim'rous beastie:\"\r\n\r\n\"to a Mountain Daisy,\" \"to a Haggis,\" \"to a Louse,\" \"to the Toothache,\"\r\n&c.--and occasionally to his brother bards and lady or gentleman\r\npatrons, often with strokes of tenderest sensibility, idiopathic humor,\r\nand genuine poetic imagination--still oftener with shrewd, original,\r\nsheeny, steel-flashes of wit, home-spun sense, or lance-blade\r\npuncturing. Then, strangely, the basis of Burns's character, with all\r\nits fun and manliness, was hypochondria, the blues, palpable enough in\r\n\"Despondency,\" \"Man was made to Mourn,\" \"Address to Ruin,\" a \"Bard's\r\nEpitaph,\" &c. From such deep-down elements sprout up, in very contrast\r\nand paradox, those riant utterances of which a superficial reading will\r\nnot detect the hidden foundation. Yet nothing is clearer to me than\r\nthe black and desperate background behind those pieces--as I shall now\r\nspecify them. I find his most characteristic, Nature's masterly touch\r\nand luxuriant life-blood, color and heat, not in \"Tam O'Shanter,\" \"the\r\nCotter's Saturday Night,\" \"Scots wha hae,\" \"Highland Mary,\" \"the Twa\r\nDogs,\" and the like, but in \"the Jolly Beggars,\" \"Rigs of Barley,\"\r\n\"Scotch Drink,\" \"the Epistle to John Rankine,\" \"Holy Willie's Prayer,\"\r\nand in \"Halloween,\" (to say nothing of a certain cluster, known still to\r\na small inner circle in Scotland, but, for good reasons, not published\r\nanywhere.) In these compositions, especially the first, there is much\r\nindelicacy (some editions flatly leave it out,) but the composer reigns\r\nalone, with handling free and broad and true, and is an artist. You may\r\nsee and feel the man indirectly in his other verses, all of them,\r\nwith more or less life-likeness--but these I have named last call out\r\npronouncedly in his own voice,\r\n\r\n    \"I, Rob, am here.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, in any summing-up of Burns, though so much is to be said in the\r\nway of fault-finding, drawing black marks, and doubtless severe literary\r\ncriticism--(in the present outpouring I have \"kept myself in,\" rather\r\nthan allow'd any free flow)--after full retrospect of his works and\r\nlife, the aforesaid \"odd-kind chiel\" remains to my heart and brain as\r\nalmost the tenderest, manliest, and (even if contradictory) dearest\r\nflesh-and-blood figure in all the streams and clusters of by-gone poets.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n[39] Probably no man that ever lived--a friend has made the\r\nstatement--was so fondly loved, both by men and women, as Robert Burns.\r\nThe reason is not hard to find: he had a real heart of flesh and blood\r\nbeating in his bosom; you could almost hear it throb. \"Some one said,\r\nthat if you had shaken hands with him his hand would have burnt yours.\r\nThe gods, indeed, made him poetical, but Nature had a hand in him first.\r\nHis heart was in the right place; he did not pile up cantos of poetic\r\ndiction; he pluck'd the mountain daisy under his feet; he wrote of\r\nfield-mouse hurrying from its ruin'd dwelling. He held the plough or the\r\npen with the same firm, manly grasp. And he was loved. The simple roll\r\nof the women who gave him their affection and their sympathy would make\r\na long manuscript; and most of these were of such noble worth that, as\r\nRobert Chambers says, 'their character may stand as a testimony in favor\r\nof that of Burns.'\" [As I understand, the foregoing is from an extremely\r\nrare book publish'd by M'Kie, in Kilmarnock. I find the whole beautiful\r\nparagraph in a capital paper on Burns, by Amelia Barr.]\r\n\r\n[40] The Dumfries statue of Robert Burns was successfully unveil'd April\r\n1881 by Lord Rosebery, the occasion having been made national in its\r\ncharacter. Before the ceremony, a large procession paraded the streets\r\nof the town, all the trades and societies of that part of Scotland\r\nbeing represented, at the head of which went dairymen and ploughmen,\r\nthe former driving their carts and being accompanied by their maids. The\r\nstatue is of Sicilian marble. It rests on a pedestal of gray stone five\r\nfeet high. The poet is represented as sitting easily on an old tree\r\nroot, holding in his left hand a cluster of daisies. His face is turn'd\r\ntoward the right shoulder, and the eyes gaze into the distance. Near by\r\nlie a collie dog, a broad bonnet half covering a well-thumb'd song-book,\r\nand a rustic flageolet. The costume is taken from the Nasmyth portrait,\r\nwhich has been follow'd for the features of the face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA WORD ABOUT TENNYSON\r\n\r\n\r\nBeautiful as the song was, the original \"Locksley Hall\" of half a\r\ncentury ago was essentially morbid, heart-broken, finding fault with\r\neverything, especially the fact of money's being made (as it ever must\r\nbe, and perhaps should be) the paramount matter in worldly affairs;\r\n\r\n    Every door is barr'd with gold, and opens but to golden keys.\r\n\r\nFirst, a father, having fallen in battle, his child (the singer)\r\n\r\n    Was left a trampled orphan, and a selfish uncle's ward.\r\n\r\nOf course love ensues. The woman in the chant or monologue proves a\r\nfalse one; and as far as appears the ideal of woman, in the poet's\r\nreflections, is a false one--at any rate for America. Woman is _not_\r\n\"the lesser man.\" (The heart is not the brain.) The best of the piece of\r\nfifty years since is its concluding line:\r\n\r\n    For the mighty wind arises roaring seaward and I go.\r\n\r\nThen for this current 1886-7, a just-out sequel, which (as an apparently\r\nauthentic summary says) \"reviews the life of mankind during the past\r\nsixty years, and comes to the conclusion that its boasted progress is of\r\ndoubtful credit to the world in general and to England in particular. A\r\ncynical vein of denunciation of democratic opinions and aspirations runs\r\nthroughout the poem in mark'd contrast with the spirit of the poet's\r\nyouth.\" Among the most striking lines of this sequel are the following:\r\n\r\n    Envy wears the mask of love, and, laughing sober fact to scorn,\r\n    Cries to weakest as to strongest, 'Ye are equals, equal born,'\r\n    Equal-born! Oh yes, if yonder hill be level with the flat.\r\n    Charm us, orator, till the lion look no larger than the cat:\r\n    Till the cat, through that mirage of overheated language, loom\r\n    Larger than the lion Demo--end in working its own doom.\r\n    Tumble Nature heel o'er head, and, yelling with the yelling street,\r\n    Set the feet above the brain, and swear the brain is in the feet,\r\n    Bring the old dark ages back, without the faith, without the hope.\r\n    Beneath the State, the Church, the Throne, and roll their ruins down\r\n      the slope.\r\n\r\nI should say that all this is a legitimate consequence of the tone\r\nand convictions of the earlier standards and points of view. Then some\r\nreflections, down to the hard-pan of this sort of thing.\r\n\r\nThe course of progressive politics (democracy) is so certain and\r\nresistless, not only in America but in Europe, that we can well afford\r\nthe warning calls, threats, checks, neutralizings, in imaginative\r\nliterature, or any department, of such deep-sounding, and high-soaring\r\nvoices as Carlyle's and Tennyson's. Nay, the blindness, excesses, of the\r\nprevalent tendency--the dangers of the urgent trends of our times--in my\r\nopinion, need such voices almost more than any. I should, too, call it\r\na signal instance of democratic humanity's luck that it has such enemies\r\nto contend with--so candid, so fervid, so heroic. But why do I say\r\nenemies? Upon the whole is not Tennyson--and was not Carlyle (like an\r\nhonest and stern physician)--the true friend of our age?\r\n\r\nLet me assume to pass verdict, or perhaps momentary judgment, for the\r\nUnited States on this poet--a remov'd and distant position giving some\r\nadvantages over a nigh one. What is Tennyson's service to his race,\r\ntimes, and especially to America? First, I should say--or at least not\r\nforget--his personal character. He is not to be mention'das a rugged,\r\nevolutionary, aboriginal force--but (and a great lesson is in it) he has\r\nbeen consistent throughout with the native, healthy, patriotic\r\nspinal element and promptings of himself. His moral line is local and\r\nconventional, but it is vital and genuine. He reflects the uppercrust of\r\nhis time, its pale cast of thought--even its _ennui_. Then the simile\r\nof my friend John Burroughs is entirely true, \"his glove is a glove of\r\nsilk, but the hand is a hand of iron.\" He shows how one can be a royal\r\nlaureate, quite elegant and \"aristocratic,\" and a little queer and\r\naffected, and at the same time perfectly manly and natural. As to his\r\nnon-democracy, it fits him well, and I like him the better for it. I\r\nguess we all like to have (I am sure I do) some one who presents those\r\nsides of a thought, or possibility, different from our own--different\r\nand yet with a sort of home-likeness--a tartness and contradiction\r\noffsetting the theory as we view it, and construed from tastes and\r\nproclivities not at all his own.\r\n\r\nTo me, Tennyson shows more than any poet I know (perhaps has been a\r\nwarning to me) how much there is in finest verbalism. There is such\r\na latent charm in mere words, cunning collocutions, and in the voice\r\nringing them, which he has caught and brought out, beyond all others--as\r\nin the line,\r\n\r\n    And hollow, hollow, hollow, all delight,\r\n\r\nin \"The Passing of Arthur,\" and evidenced in \"The Lady of Shalott,\" \"The\r\nDeserted House,\" and many other pieces. Among the best (I often linger\r\nover them again and again) are \"Lucretius,\" \"The Lotos Eaters,\" and \"The\r\nNorthern Farmer.\" His mannerism is great, but it is a noble and welcome\r\nmannerism. His very best work, to me, is contain'd in the books of \"The\r\nIdylls of the King,\" and all that has grown out of them. Though\r\nindeed we could spare nothing of Tennyson, however small or however\r\npeculiar--not \"Break, Break,\" nor \"Flower in the Crannied Wall,\" nor the\r\nold, eternally-told passion of \"Edward Gray:\"\r\n\r\n    Love may come and love may go,\r\n    And fly like a bird from tree to tree.\r\n    But I will love no more, no more\r\n    Till Ellen Adair come back to me.\r\n\r\nYes, Alfred Tennyson's is a superb character, and will help give\r\nillustriousness, through the long roll of time, to our Nineteenth\r\nCentury. In its bunch of orbic names, shining like a constellation\r\nof stars, his will be one of the brightest. His very faults, doubts,\r\nswervings, doublings upon himself, have been typical of our age. We are\r\nlike the voyagers of a ship, casting off for new seas, distant shores.\r\nWe would still dwell in the old suffocating and dead haunts, remembering\r\nand magnifying their pleasant experiences only, and more than once\r\nimpell'd to jump ashore before it is too late, and stay where our\r\nfathers stay'd, and live as they lived.\r\n\r\nMay-be I am non-literary and non-decorous (let me at least be human, and\r\npay part of my debt) in this word about Tennyson. I want him to realize\r\nthat here is a great and ardent Nation that absorbs his songs, and has\r\na respect and affection for him personally, as almost for no other\r\nforeigner. I want this word to go to the old man at Farringford as\r\nconveying no more than the simple truth; and that truth (a little\r\nChristmas gift) no slight one either. I have written impromptu, and\r\nshall let it all go at that. The readers of more than fifty millions of\r\npeople in the New World not only owe to him some of their most agreeable\r\nand harmless and healthy hours, but he has enter'd into the formative\r\ninfluences of character here, not only in the Atlantic cities, but\r\ninland and far West, out in Missouri, in Kansas, and away in Oregon, in\r\nfarmer's house and miner's cabin.\r\n\r\nBest thanks, anyhow, to Alfred Tennyson--thanks and appreciation in\r\nAmerica's name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLANG IN AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\nView'd freely, the English language is the accretion and growth of every\r\ndialect, race, and range of time, and is both the free and compacted\r\ncomposition of all. From this point of view, it stands for Language in\r\nthe largest sense, and is really the greatest of studies. It involves so\r\nmuch; is indeed a sort of universal absorber, combiner, and conqueror.\r\nThe scope of its etymologies is the scope not only of man and\r\ncivilization, but the history of Nature in all departments, and of the\r\norganic Universe, brought up to date; for all are comprehended in words,\r\nand their backgrounds. This is when words become vitaliz'd, and stand\r\nfor things, as they unerringly and soon come to do, in the mind that\r\nenters on their study with fitting spirit, grasp, and appreciation.\r\n\r\nSlang, profoundly consider'd, is the lawless germinal element, below\r\nall words and sentences, and behind all poetry, and proves a certain\r\nperennial rankness and protestantism in speech. As the United States\r\ninherit by far their most precious possession--the language they talk\r\nand write--from the Old World, under and out of its feudal institutes,\r\nI will allow myself to borrow a simile even of those forms farthest\r\nremoved from American Democracy. Considering Language then as some\r\nmighty potentate, into the majestic audience-hall of the monarch ever\r\nenters a personage like one of Shakspere's clowns, and takes position\r\nthere, and plays a part even in the stateliest ceremonies. Such is\r\nSlang, or indirection, an attempt of common humanity to escape from\r\nbald literalism, and express itself illimitably, which in highest walks\r\nproduces poets and poems, and doubtless in pre-historic times gave\r\nthe start to, and perfected, the whole immense tangle of the old\r\nmythologies. For, curious as it may appear, it is strictly the\r\nsame impulse-source, the same thing. Slang, too, is the wholesome\r\nfermentation or eructation of those processes eternally active in\r\nlanguage, by which froth and specks are thrown up, mostly to pass away;\r\nthough occasionally to settle and permanently crystallize.\r\n\r\nTo make it plainer, it is certain that many of the oldest and solidest\r\nwords we use, were originally generated from the daring and license of\r\nslang. In the processes of word-formation, myriads die, but here and\r\nthere the attempt attracts superior meanings, becomes valuable and\r\nindispensable, and lives forever. Thus the term _right_ means literally\r\nonly straight. _Wrong_ primarily meant twisted, distorted. _Integrity_\r\nmeant oneness. _Spirit_ meant breath, or flame. A _supercilious_ person\r\nwas one who rais'd his eyebrows. To _insult_ was to leap against. If you\r\n_influenced_ a man, you but flow'd into him. The Hebrew word which is\r\ntranslated _prophesy_ meant to bubble up and pour forth as a fountain.\r\nThe enthusiast bubbles up with the Spirit of God within him, and\r\nit pours forth from him like a fountain. The word prophecy is\r\nmisunderstood. Many suppose that it is limited to mere prediction; that\r\nis but the lesser portion of prophecy. The greater work is to reveal\r\nGod. Every true religious enthusiast is a prophet.\r\n\r\nLanguage, be it remember'd, is not an abstract construction of the\r\nlearn'd, or of dictionary-makers, but is something arising out of the\r\nwork, needs, ties, joys, affections, tastes, of long generations of\r\nhumanity, and has its bases broad and low, close to the ground. Its\r\nfinal decisions are made by the masses, people nearest the concrete,\r\nhaving most to do with actual land and sea. It impermeates all, the\r\nPast as well as the Present, and is the grandest triumph of the human\r\nintellect. \"Those mighty works of art,\" says Addington Symonds,\r\n\"which we call languages, in the construction of which whole peoples\r\nunconsciously co-operated, the forms of which were determin'd not by\r\nindividual genius, but by the instincts of successive generations,\r\nacting to one end, inherent in the nature of the race--Those poems of\r\npure thought and fancy, cadenced not in words, but in living imagery,\r\nfountain-heads of inspiration, mirrors of the mind of nascent nations,\r\nwhich we call Mythologies--these surely are more marvellous in their\r\ninfantine spontaneity than any more mature production of the races which\r\nevolv'd them. Yet we are utterly ignorant of their embryology; the true\r\nscience of Origins is yet in its cradle.\"\r\n\r\nDaring as it is to say so, in the growth of Language it is certain that\r\nthe retrospect of slang from the start would be the recalling from\r\ntheir nebulous conditions of all that is poetical in the stores of human\r\nutterance. Moreover, the honest delving, as of late years, by the German\r\nand British workers in comparative philology, has pierc'd and dispers'd\r\nmany of the falsest bubbles of centuries; and will disperse many more.\r\nIt was long recorded that in Scandinavian mythology the heroes in the\r\nNorse Paradise drank out of the skulls of their slain enemies. Later\r\ninvestigation proves the word taken for skulls to mean _horns_ of beasts\r\nslain in the hunt. And what reader had not been exercis'd over the\r\ntraces of that feudal custom, by which _seigneurs_ warm'd their feet in\r\nthe bowels of serfs, the abdomen being open'd for the purpose? It now\r\nis made to appear that the serf was only required to submit his unharm'd\r\nabdomen as a foot cushion while his lord supp' d, and was required to\r\nchafe the legs of the seigneur with his hands.\r\n\r\nIt is curiously in embryons and childhood, and among the illiterate,\r\nwe always find the groundwork and start, of this great science, and its\r\nnoblest products. What a relief most people have in speaking of a man\r\nnot by his true and formal name, with a \"Mister\" to it, but by some odd\r\nor homely appellative. The propensity to approach a meaning not directly\r\nand squarely, but by circuitous styles of expression, seems indeed a\r\nborn quality of the common people everywhere, evidenced by nick-names,\r\nand the inveterate determination of the masses to bestow sub-titles,\r\nsometimes ridiculous, sometimes very apt. Always among the soldiers\r\nduring the secession war, one heard of \"Little Mac\" (Gen. McClellan),\r\nor of \"Uncle Billy\" (Gen. Sherman.) \"The old man\" was, of course, very\r\ncommon. Among the rank and file, both armies, it was very general to\r\nspeak of the different States they came from by their slang names.\r\nThose from Maine were call'd Foxes; New Hampshire, Granite Boys;\r\nMassachusetts, Bay Staters; Vermont, Green Mountain Boys; Rhode Island,\r\nGun Flints; Connecticut, Wooden Nutmegs; New York, Knickerbockers; New\r\nJersey, Clam Catchers; Pennsylvania, Logher Heads; Delaware, Muskrats;\r\nMaryland, Claw Thumpers; Virginia, Beagles; North Carolina, Tar Boilers;\r\nSouth Carolina, Weasels; Georgia, Buzzards; Louisiana, Creoles; Alabama,\r\nLizards; Kentucky, Corn Crackers; Ohio, Buckeyes; Michigan, Wolverines;\r\nIndiana, Hoosiers; Illinois, Suckers; Missouri, Pukes; Mississippi,\r\nTadpoles; Florida, Fly up the Creeks; Wisconsin, Badgers; Iowa,\r\nHawkeyes; Oregon, Hard Cases. Indeed I am not sure but slang names have\r\nmore than once made Presidents. \"Old Hickory,\" (Gen. Jackson) is one\r\ncase in point. \"Tippecanoe, and Tyler too,\" another.\r\n\r\nI find the same rule in the people's conversations everywhere. I heard\r\nthis among the men of the city horse-cars, where the conductor is\r\noften call'd a \"snatcher\" (i. e. because his characteristic duty is to\r\nconstantly pull or snatch the bell-strap, to stop or go on.) Two young\r\nfellows are having a friendly talk, amid which, says 1st conductor,\r\n\"What did you do before you was a snatcher?\" Answer of 2d conductor,\r\n\"Nail'd.\" (Translation of answer: \"I work'd as carpenter.\") What is a\r\n\"boom\"? says one editor to another. \"Esteem'd contemporary,\" says the\r\nother, \"a boom is a bulge.\" \"Barefoot whiskey\" is the Tennessee name for\r\nthe undiluted stimulant. In the slang of the New York common restaurant\r\nwaiters a plate of ham and beans is known as \"stars and stripes,\"\r\ncodfish balls as \"sleeve-buttons,\" and hash as \"mystery.\"\r\n\r\nThe Western States of the Union are, however, as may be supposed,\r\nthe special areas of slang, not only in conversation, but in names of\r\nlocalities, towns, rivers, etc. A late Oregon traveller says:\r\n\r\n\"On your way to Olympia by rail, you cross a river called the\r\nShookum-Chuck; your train stops at places named Newaukum, Tumwater, and\r\nToutle; and if you seek further you will hear of whole counties labell'\r\nd Wahkiakum, or Snohomish, or Kitsar, or Klikatat; and Cowlitz, Hookium,\r\nand Nenolelops greet and offend you. They complain in Olympia that\r\nWashington Territory gets but little immigration; but what wonder? What\r\nman, having the whole American continent to choose from, would willingly\r\ndate his letters from the county of Snohomish or bring up his children\r\nin the city of Nenolelops? The village of Tumwater is, as I am ready\r\nto bear witness, very pretty indeed; but surely an emigrant would think\r\ntwice before he establish' d himself either there or at Toutle. Seattle\r\nis sufficiently barbarous; Stelicoom is no better; and I suspect that\r\nthe Northern Pacific Railroad terminus has been fixed at Tacoma because\r\nit is one of the few places on Puget Sound whose name does not inspire\r\nhorror.\"\r\n\r\nThen a Nevada paper chronicles the departure of a mining party from\r\nReno: \"The toughest set of roosters that ever shook the dust off any\r\ntown left Reno yesterday for the new mining district of Cornucopia.\r\nThey came here from Virginia. Among the crowd were four New York\r\ncock-fighters, two Chicago murderers, three Baltimore bruisers, one\r\nPhiladelphia prize-fighter, four San Francisco hoodlums, three Virginia\r\nbeats, two Union Pacific roughs, and two check guerrillas.\" Among\r\nthe far-west newspapers, have been, or are, _The Fairplay_ (Colorado)\r\n_Flume, The Solid Muldoon_, of Ouray, _The Tombstone Epitaph_, of\r\nNevada, _The Jimplecute_, of Texas, and _The Bazoo_, of Missouri.\r\nShirttail Bend, Whiskey Flat, Puppytown, Wild Yankee Ranch, Squaw Flat,\r\nRawhide Ranch, Loafer's Ravine, Squitch Gulch, Toenail Lake, are a few\r\nof the names of places in Butte county, Cal.\r\n\r\nPerhaps indeed no place or term gives more luxuriant illustrations of\r\nthe fermentation processes I have mention'd, and their froth and specks,\r\nthan those Mississippi and Pacific coast regions, at the present\r\nday. Hasty and grotesque as are some of the names, others are of an\r\nappropriateness and originality unsurpassable. This applies to the\r\nIndian words, which are often perfect. Oklahoma is proposed in Congress\r\nfor the name of one of our new Territories. Hog-eye, Lick-skillet,\r\nRake-pocket and Steal-easy are the names of some Texan towns. Miss\r\nBremer found among the aborigines the following names: _Men's_,\r\nHorn-point; Round-Wind; Stand-and-look-out; The-Cloud-that-goes-aside;\r\nIron-toe; Seek-the-sun; Iron-flash; Red-bottle; White-spindle;\r\nBlack-dog; Two-feathers-of-honor; Gray-grass; Bushy-tail; Thunder-face;\r\nGo-on-the-burning-sod; Spirits-of-the-dead. _Women's_, Keep-the-fire;\r\nSpiritual-woman; Second-daughter-of-the-house; Blue-bird.\r\n\r\nCertainly philologists have not given enough attention to this element\r\nand its results, which, I repeat, can probably be found working every\r\nwhere to-day, amid modern conditions, with as much life and activity as\r\nin far-back Greece or India, under prehistoric ones. Then the wit--the\r\nrich flashes of humor and genius and poetry--darting out often from a\r\ngang of laborers, railroad-men, miners, drivers or boatmen! How often\r\nhave I hover'd at the edge of a crowd of them, to hear their repartees\r\nand impromptus! You get more real fun from half an hour with them than\r\nfrom the books of all \"the American humorists.\"\r\n\r\nThe science of language has large and close analogies in geological\r\nscience, with its ceaseless evolution, its fossils, and its numberless\r\nsubmerged layers and hidden strata, the infinite go-before of the\r\npresent. Or, perhaps Language is more like some vast living body, or\r\nperennial body of bodies. And slang not only brings the first feeders\r\nof it, but is afterward the start of fancy, imagination and humor,\r\nbreathing into its nostrils the breath of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN INDIAN BUREAU REMINISCENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the close of the secession war in 1865, I work'd several months\r\n(until Mr. Harlan turn'd me out for having written \"Leaves of Grass\") in\r\nthe Interior Department at Washington, in the Indian Bureau. Along\r\nthis time there came to see their Great Father an unusual number of\r\naboriginal visitors, delegations for treaties, settlement of lands,\r\n&c.--some young or middle-aged, but mainly old men, from the West,\r\nNorth, and occasionally from the South--parties of from five to twenty\r\neach--the most wonderful proofs of what Nature can produce, (the\r\nsurvival of the fittest, no doubt--all the frailer samples dropt, sorted\r\nout by death)--as if to show how the earth and woods, the attrition of\r\nstorms and elements, and the exigencies of life at first hand, can\r\ntrain and fashion men, indeed _chiefs_, in heroic massiveness,\r\nimperturbability, muscle, and that last and highest beauty consisting\r\nof strength--the full exploitation and fruitage of a human identity, not\r\nfrom the culmination-points of \"culture\" and artificial civilization,\r\nbut tallying our race, as it were, with giant, vital, gnarl'd, enduring\r\ntrees, or monoliths of separate hardiest rocks, and humanity holding its\r\nown with the best of the said trees or rocks, and outdoing them.\r\n\r\nThere were Omahas, Poncas, Winnebagoes, Cheyennes, Navahos, Apaches,\r\nand many others. Let me give a running account of what I see and hear\r\nthrough one of these conference collections at the Indian Bureau, going\r\nback to the present tense. Every head and face is impressive, even\r\nartistic; Nature redeems herself out of her crudest recesses. Most have\r\nred paint on their cheeks, however, or some other paint. (\"Little Hill\"\r\nmakes the opening speech, which the interpreter translates by scraps.)\r\nMany wear head tires of gaudy-color'd braid, wound around thickly--some\r\nwith circlets of eagles' feathers. Necklaces of bears' claws are plenty\r\naround their necks. Most of the chiefs are wrapt in large blankets of\r\nthe brightest scarlet.\r\n\r\nTwo or three have blue, and I see one black. (A wise man call'd \"the\r\nFlesh\" now makes a short speech, apparently asking something. Indian\r\nCommissioner Dole answers him, and the interpreter translates in scraps\r\nagain.) All the principal chiefs have tomahawks or hatchets, some\r\nof them very richly ornamented and costly. Plaid shirts are to be\r\nobserv'd--none too clean. Now a tall fellow, \"Hole-in-the-Day,\" is\r\nspeaking. He has a copious head-dress composed of feathers and narrow\r\nribbon, under which appears a countenance painted all over a\r\nbilious yellow. Let us note this young chief. For all his paint,\r\n\"Hole-in-the-Day\" is a handsome Indian, mild and calm, dress'd in drab\r\nbuckskin leggings, dark gray surtout, and a soft black hat. His costume\r\nwill bear full observation, and even fashion would accept him. His\r\napparel is worn loose and scant enough to show his superb physique,\r\nespecially in neck, chest, and legs. (\"The Apollo Belvidere!\" was the\r\ninvoluntary exclamation of a famous European artist when he first saw a\r\nfull-grown young Choctaw.)\r\n\r\nOne of the red visitors--a wild, lean-looking Indian, the one in the\r\nblack woolen wrapper--has an empty buffalo head, with the horns on, for\r\nhis personal surmounting. I see a markedly Bourbonish countenance among\r\nthe chiefs--(it is not very uncommon among them, I am told.) Most of\r\nthem avoided resting on chairs during the hour of their \"talk\" in the\r\nCommissioner's office; they would sit around on the floor, leaning\r\nagainst something, or stand up by the walls, partially wrapt in their\r\nblankets. Though some of the young fellows were, as I have said,\r\nmagnificent and beautiful animals, I think the palm of unique\r\npicturesqueness, in body, limb, physiognomy, &c., was borne by the old\r\nor elderly chiefs, and the wise men.\r\n\r\nMy here-alluded-to experience in the Indian Bureau produced one\r\nvery definite conviction, as follows: There is something about these\r\naboriginal Americans, in their highest characteristic representations,\r\nessential traits, and the ensemble of their physique and\r\nphysiognomy--something very remote, very lofty, arousing comparisons\r\nwith our own civilized ideals--something that our literature, portrait\r\npainting, &c., have never caught, and that will almost certainly never\r\nbe transmitted to the future, even as a reminiscence. No biographer, no\r\nhistorian, no artist, has grasp'd it--perhaps could not grasp it. It is\r\nso different, so far outside our standards of eminent humanity. Their\r\nfeathers, paint--even the empty buffalo skull--did not, to say the\r\nleast, seem any more ludicrous to me than many of the fashions I have\r\nseen in civilized society. I should not apply the word savage (at any\r\nrate, in the usual sense) as a leading word in the description of those\r\ngreat aboriginal specimens, of whom I certainly saw many of the best.\r\nThere were moments, as I look'd at them or studied them, when our own\r\nexemplification of personality, dignity, heroic presentation anyhow (as\r\nin the conventions of society, or even in the accepted poems and plays,)\r\nseem'd sickly, puny, inferior.\r\n\r\nThe interpreters, agents of the Indian Department, or other whites\r\naccompanying the bands, in positions of responsibility, were always\r\ninteresting to me; I had many talks with them. Occasionally I would go\r\nto the hotels where the bands were quarter'd, and spend an hour or\r\ntwo informally. Of course we could not have much conversation--though\r\n(through the interpreters) more of this than might be\r\nsupposed--sometimes quite animated and significant. I had the good\r\nluck to be invariably receiv'd and treated by all of them in their most\r\ncordial manner.\r\n\r\n[Letter to W. W. from an artist, B. H., who has been much among the\r\nAmerican Indians:]\r\n\r\n\"I have just receiv'd your little paper on the Indian delegations. In\r\nthe fourth paragraph you say that there is something about the\r\nessential traits of our aborigines which 'will almost certainly never be\r\ntransmitted to the future.' If I am so fortunate as to regain my health\r\nI hope to weaken the force of that statement, at least in so far as\r\nmy talent and training will permit. I intend to spend some years among\r\nthem, and shall endeavor to perpetuate on canvas some of the finer\r\ntypes, both men and women, and some of the characteristic features\r\nof their life. It will certainly be well worth the while. My artistic\r\nenthusiasm was never so thoroughly stirr'd up as by the Indians. They\r\ncertainly have more of beauty, dignity and nobility mingled with their\r\nown wild individuality, than any of the other indigenous types of man.\r\nNeither black nor Afghan, Arab nor Malay (and I know them all pretty\r\nwell) can hold a candle to the Indian. All of the other aboriginal\r\ntypes seem to be more or less distorted from the model of perfect human\r\nform--as we know it--the blacks, thin-hipped, with bulbous limbs, not\r\nwell mark'd; the Arabs large-jointed, &c. But I have seen many a young\r\nIndian as perfect in form and feature as a Greek statue--very different\r\nfrom a Greek statue, of course, but as satisfying to the artistic\r\nperceptions and demand.\r\n\r\n\"And the worst, or perhaps the best of it all is that it will require\r\nan artist--and a good one--to record the real facts and impressions. Ten\r\nthousand photographs would not have the value of one really finely felt\r\npainting. Color is all-important. No one but an artist knows how much.\r\nAn Indian is only half an Indian without the blue-black hair and\r\nthe brilliant eyes shining out of the wonderful dusky ochre and rose\r\ncomplexion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME DIARY NOTES AT RANDOM\r\n\r\n\r\nNEGRO SLAVES IN NEW YORK\r\n\r\nI can myself almost remember negro slaves in New York State, as my\r\ngrandfather and great-grandfather (at West Hills, Suffolk county, New\r\nYork) own'd a number. The hard labor of the farm was mostly done by\r\nthem, and on the floor of the big kitchen, toward sundown, would be\r\nsquatting a circle of twelve or fourteen \"pickaninnies,\" eating\r\ntheir supper of pudding (Indian corn mush) and milk. A friend of my\r\ngrandfather, named Wortman, of Oyster Bay, died in 1810, leaving ten\r\nslaves. Jeanette Treadwell, the last of them, died suddenly in Flushing\r\nlast summer (1884,) at the age of ninety-four years. I remember \"old\r\nMose,\" one of the liberated West Hills slaves, well. He was very genial,\r\ncorrect, manly, and cute, and a great friend of my childhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANADA NIGHTS--_Late in August_--\r\n\r\nThree wondrous nights. Effects of moon, clouds, stars, and night-sheen,\r\nnever surpass'd. I am out every night, enjoying all. The sunset begins\r\nit. (I have said already how long evening lingers here.) The moon, an\r\nhour high just after eight, is past her half, and looks somehow more\r\nlike a human face up there than ever before. As it grows later, we have\r\nsuch gorgeous and broad cloud-effects, with Luna's tawny halos,\r\nsilver edgings--great fleeces, depths of blue-black in patches, and\r\noccasionally long, low bars hanging silently a while, and then gray\r\nbulging masses rolling along stately, sometimes in long procession.\r\nThe moon travels in Scorpion to-night, and dims all the stars of that\r\nconstellation except fiery Antares, who keeps on shining just to the big\r\none's side.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTRY DAYS AND NIGHTS--\r\n\r\n_Sept. 30, '82, 4.30 A.M._--I am down in Camden county, New Jersey, at\r\nthe farmhouse of the Staffords--have been looking a long while at\r\nthe comet--have in my time seen longer-tail'd ones, but never one so\r\npronounc'd in cometary character, and so spectral-fierce--so like some\r\ngreat, pale, living monster of the air or sea. The atmosphere and sky,\r\nan hour or so before sunrise, so cool, still, translucent, give the\r\nwhole apparition to great advantage. It is low in the east. The head\r\nshows about as big as an ordinary good-sized saucer--is a perfectly\r\nround and defined disk--the tail some sixty or seventy feet--not a\r\nstripe, but quite broad, and gradually expanding. Impress'd with the\r\nsilent, inexplicably emotional sight, I linger and look till all begins\r\nto weaken in the break of day.\r\n\r\n_October 2_.--The third day of mellow, delicious, sunshiny weather. I\r\nam writing this in the recesses of the old woods, my seat on a big pine\r\nlog, my back against a tree. Am down here a few days for a change, to\r\nbask in the Autumn sun, to idle lusciously and simply, and to eat hearty\r\nmeals, especially my breakfast. Warm mid-days--the other hours of\r\nthe twenty-four delightfully fresh and mild--cool evenings, and early\r\nmornings perfect. The scent of the woods, and the peculiar aroma of a\r\ngreat yet unreap'd maize-field near by--the white butterflies in every\r\ndirection by day--the golden-rod, the wild asters, and sunflowers--the\r\nsong of the katydid all night.\r\n\r\nEvery day in Cooper's Woods, enjoying simple existence and the passing\r\nhours--taking short walks--exercising arms and chest with the saplings,\r\nor my voice with army songs or recitations. A perfect week for weather;\r\nseven continuous days bright and dry and cool and sunny. The nights\r\nsplendid, with full moon--about 10 the grandest of star-shows up in the\r\neast and south, Jupiter, Saturn, Capella, Aldebaran, and great Orion.\r\nAm feeling pretty well--am outdoors most of the time, absorbing the days\r\nand nights all I can.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRAL PARK NOTES\r\n\r\n_American Society from a Park Policeman's Point of View_\r\n\r\nAm in New York city, upper part--visit Central Park almost every day\r\n(and have for the last three weeks) off and on, taking observations or\r\nshort rambles, and sometimes riding around. I talk quite a good deal\r\nwith one of the Park policemen, C.C., up toward the Ninetieth street\r\nentrance. One day in particular I got him a-going, and it proved deeply\r\ninteresting to me. Our talk floated into sociology and politics. I\r\nwas curious to find how these things appear'd on their surfaces to my\r\nfriend, for he plainly possess'd sharp wits and good nature, and had\r\nbeen seeing, for years, broad streaks of humanity somewhat out of\r\nmy latitude. I found that as he took such appearances the inward\r\ncaste-spirit of European \"aristocracy\" pervaded rich America, with\r\ncynicism and artificiality at the fore. Of the bulk of official persons,\r\nExecutives, Congressmen, Legislators, Aldermen, Department heads, &c.,\r\n&c., or the candidates for those positions, nineteen in twenty, in the\r\npoliceman's judgment, were just players in a game. Liberty, Equality,\r\nUnion, and all the grand words of the Republic, were, in their mouths,\r\nbut lures, decoys, chisel'd likenesses of dead wood, to catch the\r\nmasses. Of fine afternoons, along the broad tracks of the Park, for many\r\nyears, had swept by my friend, as he stood on guard, the carriages, &c.,\r\nof American Gentility, not by dozens and scores, but by hundreds\r\nand thousands. Lucky brokers, capitalists, contractors, grocery-men,\r\nsuccessful political strikers, rich butchers, dry goods' folk, &c. And\r\non a large proportion of these vehicles, on panels or horse-trappings,\r\nwere conspicuously borne _heraldic family crests_. (Can this really be\r\ntrue?) In wish and willingness (and if that were so, what matter about\r\nthe reality?) titles of nobility, with a court and spheres fit for the\r\ncapitalists, the highly educated, and the carriage-riding classes--to\r\nfence them off from \"the common people\"--were the heart's desire of the\r\n\"good society\" of our great cities--aye, of North and South.\r\n\r\nSo much for my police friend's speculations--which rather took me\r\naback--and which I have thought I would just print as he gave them (as a\r\ndoctor records symptoms.)\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE GLASS NOTES\r\n\r\n_St. Louis, Missouri, November, '79_.--What do you think I find\r\nmanufactur'd out here--and of a kind the clearest and largest, best, and\r\nthe most finish'd and luxurious in the world--and with ample demand\r\nfor it too? _Plate glass_! One would suppose that was the last dainty\r\noutcome of an old, almost effete-growing civilization; and yet here it\r\nis, a few miles from St. Louis, on a charming little river, in the wilds\r\nof the West, near the Mississippi. I went down that way to-day by the\r\nIron Mountain Railroad--was switch'd off on a side-track four miles\r\nthrough woods and ravines, to Swash Creek, so-call'd, and there found\r\nCrystal city, and immense Glass Works, built (and evidently built to\r\nstay) right in the pleasant rolling forest. Spent most of the day, and\r\nexamin'd the inexhaustible and peculiar sand the glass is made of--the\r\noriginal whity-gray stuff in the banks--saw the melting in the pots (a\r\nwondrous process, a real poem)--saw the delicate preparation the clay\r\nmaterial undergoes for these great pots (it has to be kneaded finally\r\nby human feet, no machinery answering, and I watch'd the picturesque\r\nbare-legged Africans treading it)--saw the molten stuff (a great mass\r\nof a glowing pale yellow color) taken out of the furnaces (I shall never\r\nforget that Pot, shape, color, concomitants, more beautiful than any\r\nantique statue,) pass'd into the adjoining casting-room, lifted by\r\npowerful machinery, pour'd out on its bed (all glowing, a newer, vaster\r\nstudy for colorists, indescribable, a pale red-tinged yellow, of tarry\r\nconsistence, all lambent,) roll'd by a heavy roller into rough plate\r\nglass, I should say ten feet by fourteen, then rapidly shov'd into the\r\nannealing oven, which stood ready for it. The polishing and grinding\r\nrooms afterward--the great glass slabs, hundreds of them, on their flat\r\nbeds, and the see-saw music of the steam machinery constantly at work\r\npolishing them--the myriads of human figures (the works employ'd\r\n400 men) moving about, with swart arms and necks, and no superfluous\r\nclothing--the vast, rude halls, with immense play of shifting shade, and\r\nslow-moving currents of smoke and steam, and shafts of light, sometimes\r\nsun, striking in from above with effects that would have fill'd Michel\r\nAngelo with rapture.\r\n\r\nComing back to St. Louis this evening, at sundown, and for over an\r\nhour afterward, we follow'd the Mississippi, close by its western\r\nbank, giving me an ampler view of the river, and with effects a little\r\ndifferent from any yet. In the eastern sky hung the planet Mars, just\r\nup, and of a very clear and vivid yellow. It was a soothing and pensive\r\nhour--the spread of the river off there in the half-light--the glints\r\nof the down-bound steamboats plodding along--and that yellow orb\r\n(apparently twice as large and significant as usual) above the Illinois\r\nshore. (All along, these nights, nothing can exceed the calm, fierce,\r\ngolden, glistening domination of Mars over all the stars in the sky.)\r\n\r\nAs we came nearer St. Louis, the night having well set in, I saw some\r\n(to me) novel effects in the zinc smelting establishments, the tall\r\nchimneys belching flames at the top, while inside through the openings\r\nat the façades of the great tanks burst forth (in regular position)\r\nhundreds of fierce tufts of a peculiar blue (or green) flame, of a\r\npurity and intensity, like electric lights--illuminating not only the\r\ngreat buildings themselves, but far and near outside, like hues of the\r\naurora borealis, only more vivid. (So that--remembering the Pot from the\r\ncrystal furnace--my jaunt seem'd to give me new revelations in the color\r\nline.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME WAR MEMORANDA\r\n\r\n_Jotted Down at the Time_\r\n\r\n\r\nI find this incident in my notes (I suppose from \"chinning\" in hospital\r\nwith some sick or wounded soldier who knew of it):\r\n\r\nWhen Kilpatrick and his forces were cut off at Brandy station (last\r\nof September, '63, or thereabouts,) and the bands struck up \"Yankee\r\nDoodle,\" there were not cannon enough in the Southern Confederacy to\r\nkeep him and them \"in.\" It was when Meade fell back. K. had his large\r\ncavalry division (perhaps 5,000 men,) but the rebs, in superior force,\r\nhad surrounded them. Things look'd exceedingly desperate. K. had two\r\nfine bands, and order'd them up immediately; they join'd and play'd\r\n\"Yankee Doodle\" with a will! It went through the men like lightning--but\r\nto inspire, not to unnerve. Every man seem'd a giant. They charged like\r\na cyclone, and cut their way out. Their loss was but 20. It was about\r\ntwo in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON STREET SCENES\r\n\r\n_Walking Down Pennsylvania Avenue_\r\n\r\n_April 7, 1864_.--Warmish forenoon, after the storm of the past few\r\ndays. I see, passing up, in the broad space between the curbs, a big\r\nsquad of a couple of hundred conscripts, surrounded by a strong\r\ncordon of arm'd guards, and others interspers'd between the ranks. The\r\ngovernment has learn'd caution from its experiences; there are many\r\nhundreds of \"bounty jumpers,\" and already, as I am told, eighty thousand\r\ndeserters! Next (also passing up the Avenue,) a cavalry company, young,\r\nbut evidently well drill'd and service-harden'd men. Mark the upright\r\nposture in their saddles, the bronz'd and bearded young faces, the easy\r\nswaying to the motions of the horses, and the carbines by their right\r\nknees; handsome and reckless, some eighty of them, riding with rapid\r\ngait, clattering along. Then the tinkling bells of passing cars, the\r\nmany shops (some with large show-windows, some with swords, straps\r\nfor the shoulders of different ranks, hat-cords with acorns, or other\r\ninsignia,) the military patrol marching along, with the orderly or\r\nsecond-lieutenant stopping different ones to examine passes--the forms,\r\nthe faces, all sorts crowded together, the worn and pale, the pleas'd,\r\nsome on their way to the railroad depot going home, the cripples, the\r\ndarkeys, the long trains of government wagons, or the sad strings of\r\nambulances conveying wounded--the many officers' horses tied in front\r\nof the drinking or oyster saloons, or held by black men or boys, or\r\norderlies.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE 195TH PENNSYLVANIA\r\n\r\n_Tuesday, Aug. 1, 1865_.--About 3 o'clock this afternoon (sun broiling\r\nhot) in Fifteenth street, by the Treasury building, a large and handsome\r\nregiment, 195th Pennsylvania, were marching by--as it happen'd, receiv'd\r\norders just here to halt and break ranks, so that they might rest\r\nthemselves awhile. I thought I never saw a finer set of men--so hardy,\r\ncandid, bright American looks, all weather-beaten, and with warm\r\nclothes. Every man was home-born. My heart was much drawn toward them.\r\nThey seem'd very tired, red, and streaming with sweat. It is a one-year\r\nregiment, mostly from Lancaster county, Pa.; have been in Shenandoah\r\nvalley. On halting, the men unhitch'd their knapsacks, and sat down to\r\nrest themselves. Some lay flat on the pavement or under trees. The fine\r\nphysical appearance of the whole body was remarkable. Great, very\r\ngreat, must be the State where such young farmers and mechanics are\r\nthe practical average. I went around for half an hour and talk'd with\r\nseveral of them, sometimes squatting down with the groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEFT-HAND WRITING BY SOLDIERS\r\n\r\n_April 30, 1866_.--Here is a single significant fact, from which one may\r\njudge of the character of the American soldiers in this just concluded\r\nwar: A gentleman in New York city, a while since, took it into his head\r\nto collect specimens of writing from soldiers who had lost their right\r\nhands in battle, and afterwards learn'd to use the left. He gave\r\npublic notice of his desire, and offer'd prizes for the best of these\r\nspecimens. Pretty soon they began to come in, and by the time specified\r\nfor awarding the prizes three hundred samples of such left-hand writing\r\nby maim'd soldiers had arrived.\r\n\r\nI have just been looking over some of this writing. A great many of the\r\nspecimens are written in a beautiful manner. All are good. The writing\r\nin nearly all cases slants backward instead of forward. One piece of\r\nwriting, from a soldier who had lost both arms, was made by holding the\r\npen in his mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRAL VIRGINIA IN '64\r\n\r\nCulpepper, where I am stopping, looks like a place of two or three\r\nthousand inhabitants. Must be one of the pleasantest towns in Virginia.\r\nEven now, dilapidated fences, all broken down, windows out, it has the\r\nremains of much beauty. I am standing on an eminence overlooking the\r\ntown, though within its limits. To the west the long Blue Mountain range\r\nis very plain, looks quite near, though from 30 to 50 miles distant,\r\nwith some gray splashes of snow yet visible. The show is varied and\r\nfascinating. I see a great eagle up there in the air sailing with pois'd\r\nwings, quite low. Squads of red-legged soldiers are drilling; I suppose\r\nsome of the new men of the Brooklyn 14th; they march off presently with\r\nmuskets on their shoulders. In another place, just below me, are some\r\nsoldiers squaring off logs to build a shanty--chopping away, and the\r\nnoise of the axes sounding sharp. I hear the bellowing, unmusical\r\nscreech of the mule. I mark the thin blue smoke rising from camp fires.\r\nJust below me is a collection of hospital tents, with a yellow flag\r\nelevated on a stick, and moving languidly in the breeze. Two discharged\r\nmen (I know them both) are just leaving. One is so weak he can hardly\r\nwalk; the other is stronger, and carries his comrade's musket. They move\r\nslowly along the muddy road toward the depot. The scenery is full of\r\nbreadth, and spread on the most generous scale (everywhere in Virginia\r\nthis thought fill'd me.) The sights, the scenes, the groups, have been\r\nvaried and picturesque here beyond description, and remain so.\r\n\r\nI heard the men return in force the other night--heard the shouting, and\r\ngot up and went out to hear what was the matter. That night scene of\r\nso many hundred tramping steadily by, through the mud (some big flaring\r\ntorches of pine knots,) I shall never forget. I like to go to the\r\npaymaster's tent, and watch the men getting paid off. Some have\r\nfurloughs, and start at once for home, sometimes amid great chaffing and\r\nblarneying. There is every day the sound of the wood-chopping axe, and\r\nthe plentiful sight of negroes, crows, and mud. I note large droves and\r\npens of cattle. The teamsters have camps of their own, and I go often\r\namong them. The officers occasionally invite me to dinner or supper at\r\nheadquarters. The fare is plain, but you get something good to drink,\r\nand plenty of it. Gen. Meade is absent; Sedgwick is in command.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAYING THE 1ST U. S. C. T.\r\n\r\nOne of my war time reminiscences comprises the quiet side scene of\r\na visit I made to the First Regiment U. S. Color'd Troops, at their\r\nencampment, and on the occasion of their first paying off, July 11,\r\n1863. Though there is now no difference of opinion worth mentioning,\r\nthere was a powerful opposition to enlisting blacks during the\r\nearlier years of the secession war. Even then, however, they had their\r\nchampions. \"That the color'd race,\" said a good authority, \"is capable\r\nof military training and efficiency, is demonstrated by the testimony\r\nof numberless witnesses, and by the eagerness display'd in the raising,\r\norganizing, and drilling of African troops. Few white regiments make a\r\nbetter appearance on parade than the First and Second Louisiana\r\nNative Guards. The same remark is true of other color'd regiments. At\r\nMilliken's Bend, at Vicksburg, at Port Hudson, on Morris Island, and\r\nwherever tested, they have exhibited determin'd bravery, and compell'd\r\nthe plaudits alike of the thoughtful and thoughtless soldiery. During\r\nthe siege of Port Hudson the question was often ask'd those who beheld\r\ntheir resolute charges, how the 'niggers' behav'd under fire; and\r\nwithout exception the answer was complimentary to them. 'O, tip-top!'\r\n'first-rate!' 'bully!' were the usual replies. But I did not start out\r\nto argue the case--only to give my reminiscence literally, as jotted on\r\nthe spot at the time.\"\r\n\r\nI write this on Mason's (otherwise Analostan) island, under the fine\r\nshade trees of an old white stucco house, with big rooms; the white\r\nstucco house, originally a fine country seat (tradition says the famous\r\nVirginia Mason, author of the Fugitive Slave Law, was born here.)\r\nI reach'd the spot from my Washington quarters by ambulance up\r\nPennsylvania avenue, through Georgetown, across the Aqueduct bridge, and\r\naround through a cut and winding road, with rocks and many bad gullies\r\nnot lacking. After reaching the island, we get presently in the midst of\r\nthe camp of the 1st Regiment U. S. C. T. The tents look clean and good;\r\nindeed, altogether, in locality especially, the pleasantest camp I have\r\nyet seen. The spot is umbrageous, high and dry, with distant sounds of\r\nthe city, and the puffing steamers of the Potomac, up to Georgetown and\r\nback again. Birds are singing in the trees, the warmth is endurable here\r\nin this moist shade, with the fragrance and freshness. A hundred rods\r\nacross is Georgetown. The river between is swell'd and muddy from the\r\nlate rains up country. So quiet here, yet full of vitality, all around\r\nin the far distance glimpses, as I sweep my eye, of hills, verdure-clad,\r\nand with plenteous trees; right where I sit, locust, sassafras, spice,\r\nand many other trees, a few with huge parasitic vines; just at hand the\r\nbanks sloping to the river, wild with beautiful, free vegetation, superb\r\nweeds, better, in their natural growth and forms, than the best garden.\r\nLots of luxuriant grape vines and trumpet flowers; the river flowing far\r\ndown in the distance.\r\n\r\nNow the paying is to begin. The Major (paymaster) with his clerk seat\r\nthemselves at a table--the rolls are before them--the money box is\r\nopen'd--there are packages of five, ten, twenty-five cent pieces. Here\r\ncomes the first Company (B), some 82 men, all blacks. Certes, we cannot\r\nfind fault with the appearance of this crowd--negroes though they\r\nbe. They are manly enough, bright enough, look as if they had the\r\nsoldier-stuff in them, look hardy, patient, many of them real handsome\r\nyoung fellows. The paying, I say, has begun. The men are march'd up in\r\nclose proximity. The clerk calls off name after name, and each walks up,\r\nreceives his money, and passes along out of the way. It is a real study,\r\nboth to see them come close, and to see them pass away, stand counting\r\ntheir cash--(nearly all of this company get ten dollars and three cents\r\neach.) The clerk calls George Washington. That distinguish'd personage\r\nsteps from the ranks, in the shape of a very black man, good sized and\r\nshaped, and aged about 30, with a military mustache; he takes his \"ten\r\nthree,\" and goes off evidently well pleas'd. (There are about a dozen\r\nWashingtons in the company. Let us hope they will do honor to the name.)\r\nAt the table, how quickly the Major handles the bills, counts without\r\ntrouble, everything going on smoothly and quickly. The regiment numbers\r\nto-day about 1,000 men (including 20 officers, the only whites.)\r\n\r\nNow another company. These get $5.36 each. The men look well. They, too,\r\nhave great names; besides the Washingtons aforesaid, John Quincy Adams,\r\nDaniel Webster, Calhoun, James Madison, Alfred Tennyson, John Brown,\r\nBenj. G. Tucker, Horace Greeley, &c. The men step off aside, count their\r\nmoney with a pleas'd, half-puzzled look. Occasionally, but not often,\r\nthere are some thoroughly African physiognomies, very black in color,\r\nlarge, protruding lips, low forehead, &c. But I have to say that I do\r\nnot see one utterly revolting face.\r\n\r\nThen another company, each man of this getting $10.03 also. The pay\r\nproceeds very rapidly (the calculation, roll-signing, &c., having been\r\narranged beforehand.) Then some trouble. One company, by the rigid rules\r\nof official computation, gets only 23 cents each man. The company (K)\r\nis indignant, and after two or three are paid, the refusal to take the\r\npaltry sum is universal, and the company marches off to quarters unpaid.\r\n\r\nAnother company (I) gets only 70 cents. The sullen, lowering,\r\ndisappointed look is general. Half refuse it in this case. Company G, in\r\nfull dress, with brass scales on shoulders, look'd, perhaps, as well as\r\nany of the companies--the men had an unusually alert look. These, then,\r\nare the black troops,--or the beginning of them. Well, no one can see\r\nthem, even under these circumstances--their military career in its\r\nnovitiate--without feeling well pleas'd with them.\r\n\r\nAs we enter'd the island, we saw scores at a little distance, bathing,\r\nwashing their clothes, &c. The officers, as far as looks go, have a fine\r\nappearance, have good faces, and the air military. Altogether it is a\r\nsignificant show, and brings up some \"abolition\" thoughts. The scene,\r\nthe porch of an Old Virginia slave-owner's house, the Potomac rippling\r\nnear, the Capitol just down three or four miles there, seen through the\r\npleasant blue haze of this July day.\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of hours I get tired, and go off for a ramble. I write\r\nthese concluding lines on a rock, under the shade of a tree on the banks\r\nof the island. It is solitary here, the birds singing, the sluggish\r\nmuddy-yellow waters pouring down from the late rains of the upper\r\nPotomac; the green heights on the south side of the river before me.\r\nThe single cannon from a neighboring fort has just been fired, to signal\r\nhigh noon. I have walk'd all around Analostan, enjoying its luxuriant\r\nwildness, and stopt in this solitary spot. A water snake wriggles down\r\nthe bank, disturb'd, into the water. The bank near by is fringed with a\r\ndense growth of shrubbery, vines, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE THOUSAND POEMS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere have been collected in a cluster nearly five thousand big and\r\nlittle American poems--all that diligent and long-continued research\r\ncould lay hands on! The author of 'Old Grimes is Dead' commenced\r\nit, more than fifty years ago; then the cluster was pass'd on and\r\naccumulated by C. F. Harris; then further pass'd on and added to by the\r\nlate Senator Anthony, from whom the whole collection has been bequeath'd\r\nto Brown University. A catalogue (such as it is) has been made and\r\npublish'd of these five thousand poems--and is probably the most curious\r\nand suggestive part of the whole affair. At any rate it has led me to\r\nsome abstract reflection like the following.\r\n\r\nI should like, for myself, to put on record my devout acknowledgment not\r\nonly of the great masterpieces of the past, but of the benefit of _all_\r\npoets, past and present, and of _all_ poetic utterance--in its entirety\r\nthe dominant moral factor of humanity's progress. In view of that\r\nprogress, and of evolution, the religious and esthetic elements, the\r\ndistinctive and most important of any, seem to me more indebted to\r\npoetry than to all other means and influences combined. In a very\r\nprofound sense _religion is the poetry of humanity_. Then the points of\r\nunion and rapport among all the poems and poets of the world, however\r\nwide their separations of time and place and theme, are much more\r\nnumerous and weighty than the points of contrast. Without relation as\r\nthey may seem at first sight, the whole earth's poets and poetry--_en\r\nmasse_--the Oriental, the Greek, and what there is of Roman--the oldest\r\nmyths--the interminable ballad-romances of the Middle Ages--the hymns\r\nand psalms of worship--the epics, plays, swarms of lyrics of the British\r\nIslands, or the Teutonic old or new--or modern French--or what there is\r\nin America, Bryant's, for instance, or Whittier's or Longfellow's--the\r\nverse of all tongues and ages, all forms, all subjects, from primitive\r\ntimes to our own day inclusive--really combine in one aggregate and\r\nelectric globe or universe, with all its numberless parts and radiations\r\nheld together by a common centre or verteber. To repeat it, all poetry\r\nthus has (to the point of view comprehensive enough) more features of\r\nresemblance than difference, and becomes essentially, like the planetary\r\nglobe itself, compact and orbic and whole. Nature seems to sow countless\r\nseeds--makes incessant crude attempts--thankful to get now and then,\r\neven at rare and long intervals, something approximately good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLD BOWERY\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Reminiscence of New York Plays and Acting Fifty Years Ago_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an article not long since, \"Mrs. Siddons as Lady Macbeth,\" in \"The\r\nNineteenth Century,\" after describing the bitter regretfulness to\r\nmankind from the loss of those first-class poems, temples, pictures,\r\ngone and vanish'd from any record of men, the writer (Fleeming Jenkin)\r\ncontinues:\r\n\r\n  If this be our feeling as to the more durable works of art, what\r\n  shall we say of those triumphs which, by their very nature, la\r\n  no longer than the action which creates them--the triumphs of the\r\n  orator, the singer, or the actor? There is an anodyne in the words,\r\n  \"must be so,\" \"inevitable,\" and there is even some absurdity in\r\n  longing for the impossible. This anodyne and our sense of humor\r\n  temper the unhappiness we feel when, after hearing some great\r\n  performance, we leave the theatre and think, \"Well, this great thing\r\n  has been, and all that is now left of it is the feeble print up\r\n  my brain, the little thrill which memory will send along my nerves,\r\n  mine and my neighbors; as we live longer the print and thrill must\r\n  be feebler, and when we pass away the impress of the great artist\r\n  will vanish from the world.\" The regret that a great art should in\r\n  its nature be transitory, explains the lively interest which many\r\n  feel in reading anecdotes or descriptions of a great actor.\r\n\r\nAll this is emphatically my own feeling and reminiscence about the best\r\ndramatic and lyric artists I have seen in bygone days--for instance,\r\nMarietta Alboni, the elder Booth, Forrest, the tenor Bettini, the\r\nbaritone Badiali, \"old man Clarke\"--(I could write a whole paper on the\r\nlatter's peerless rendering of the Ghost in \"Hamlet\" at the Park, when\r\nI was a young fellow)--an actor named Ranger, who appear'd in America\r\nforty years ago in _genre_ characters; Henry Placide, and many others.\r\nBut I will make a few memoranda at least of the best one I knew.\r\n\r\nFor the elderly New Yorker of to-day, perhaps, nothing were more likely\r\nto start up memories of his early manhood than the mention of the Bowery\r\nand the elder Booth, At the date given, the more stylish and select\r\ntheatre (prices, 50 cents pit, $1 boxes) was \"The Park,\" a large and\r\nwell-appointed house on Park Row, opposite the present Post-office.\r\nEnglish opera and the old comedies were often given in capital style;\r\nthe principal foreign stars appear'd here, with Italian opera at\r\nwide intervals. The Park held a large part in my boyhood's and young\r\nmanhood's life. Here I heard the English actor, Anderson, in \"Charles\r\nde Moor,\" and in the fine part of \"Gisippus.\" Here I heard Fanny Kemble,\r\nCharlotte Cushman, the Seguins, Daddy Rice, Hackett as Falstaff, Nimrod\r\nWildfire, Rip Van Winkle, and in his Yankee characters. (See pages 19,\r\n20, \"Specimen Days.\") It was here (some years later than the date in the\r\nheadline) I also heard Mario many times, and at his best. In such parts\r\nas Gennaro, in \"Lucrezia Borgia,\" he was inimitable--the sweetest of\r\nvoices, a pure tenor, of considerable compass and respectable power. His\r\nwife, Grisi, was with him, no longer first-class or young--a fine Norma,\r\nthough, to the last.\r\n\r\nPerhaps my dearest amusement reminiscences are those musical ones. I\r\ndoubt if ever the senses and emotions of the future will be thrill'd as\r\nwere the auditors of a generation ago by the deep passion of Alboni's\r\ncontralto (at the Broadway Theatre, south side, near Pearl street)--or\r\nby the trumpet notes of Badiali's baritone, or Bettini's pensive and\r\nincomparable tenor in Fernando in \"Favorita,\" or Marini's bass in\r\n\"Faliero,\" among the Havana troupe, Castle Garden.\r\n\r\nBut getting back more specifically to the date and theme I started\r\nfrom--the heavy tragedy business prevail'd more decidedly at the Bowery\r\nTheatre, where Booth and Forrest were frequently to be heard. Though\r\nBooth _pere,_ then in his prime, ranging in age from 40 to 44 years (he\r\nwas born in 1796,) was the loyal child and continuer of the traditions\r\nof orthodox English play-acting, he stood out \"himself alone\" in many\r\nrespects beyond any of his kind on record, and with effects and ways\r\nthat broke through all rules and all traditions. He has been well\r\ndescrib'd as an actor \"whose instant and tremendous concentration of\r\npassion in his delineations overwhelm'd his audience, and wrought into\r\nit such enthusiasm that it partook of the fever of inspiration surging\r\nthrough his own veins.\" He seems to have been of beautiful private\r\ncharacter, very honorable, affectionate, good-natured, no arrogance,\r\nglad to give the other actors the best chances. He knew all stage points\r\nthoroughly, and curiously ignored the mere dignities. I once talk'd with\r\na man who had seen him do the Second Actor in the mock play to Charles\r\nKean's Hamlet in Baltimore. He was a marvellous linguist. He play'd\r\nShylock once in London, giving the dialogue in Hebrew, and in New\r\nOrleans Oreste (Racine's \"Andromaque\") in French. One trait of his\r\nhabits, I have heard, was strict vegetarianism. He was exceptionally\r\nkind to the brute creation. Every once in a while he would make a break\r\nfor solitude or wild freedom, sometimes for a few hours, sometimes for\r\ndays. (He illustrated Plato's rule that to the forming an artist of the\r\nvery highest rank a dash of insanity or what the world calls insanity\r\nis indispensable.) He was a small-sized man--yet sharp observers noticed\r\nthat however crowded the stage might be in certain scenes, Booth\r\nnever seem'd overtopt or hidden. He was singularly spontaneous and\r\nfluctuating; in the same part each rendering differ'd from any and\r\nall others. He had no stereotyped positions and made no arbitrary\r\nrequirements on his fellow-performers.\r\n\r\nAs is well known to old play-goers, Booth's most effective part was\r\nRichard III. Either that, or lago, or Shylock, or Pescara in \"The\r\nApostate,\" was sure to draw a crowded house. (Remember heavy pieces were\r\nmuch more in demand those days than now.) He was also unapproachably\r\ngrand in Sir Giles Overreach, in \"A New Way to Pay Old Debts,\" and the\r\nprincipal character in \"The Iron Chest.\"\r\n\r\nIn any portraiture of Booth, those years, the Bowery Theatre, with its\r\nleading lights, and the lessee and manager, Thomas Hamblin, cannot be\r\nleft out. It was at the Bowery I first saw Edwin Forrest (the play was\r\nJohn Howard Payne's \"Brutus, or the Fall of Tarquin,\" and it affected\r\nme for weeks; or rather I might say permanently filter'd into my whole\r\nnature,) then in the zenith of his fame and ability. Sometimes (perhaps\r\na veteran's benefit night,) the Bowery would group together five or\r\nsix of the first-class actors of those days--Booth, Forrest, Cooper,\r\nHamblin, and John R. Scott, for instance. At that time and here George\r\nJones (\"Count Joannes\") was a young, handsome actor, and quite a\r\nfavorite. I remember seeing him in the title role in \"Julius Caesar,\"\r\nand a capital performance it was.\r\n\r\nTo return specially to the manager. Thomas Hamblin made a first-rate\r\nfoil to Booth, and was frequently cast with him. He had a large,\r\nshapely, imposing presence, and dark and flashing eyes. I remember well\r\nhis rendering of the main role in Maturin's \"Bertram, or the Castle\r\nof St. Aldobrand.\" But I thought Tom Hamblin's best acting was in the\r\ncomparatively minor part of Faulconbridge in \"King John\"--he himself\r\nevidently revell'd in the part, and took away the house's applause from\r\nyoung Kean (the King) and Ellen Tree (Constance,) and everybody else on\r\nthe stage--some time afterward at the Park. Some of the Bowery actresses\r\nwere remarkably good. I remember Mrs. Pritchard in \"Tour de Nesle,\" and\r\nMrs. McClure in \"Fatal Curiosity,\" and as Millwood in \"George Barnwell.\"\r\n(I wonder what old fellow reading these lines will recall the fine\r\ncomedietta of \"The Youth That Never Saw a Woman,\" and the jolly acting\r\nin it of Mrs. Herring and old Gates.)\r\n\r\nThe Bowery, now and then, was the place, too, for spectacular pieces,\r\nsuch as \"The Last Days of Pompeii,\" \"The Lion-Doom'd\" and the yet\r\nundying \"Mazeppa.\" At one time \"Jonathan Bradford, or the Murder at the\r\nRoadside Inn, \"had a long and crowded run; John Sefton and his brother\r\nWilliam acted in it. I remember well the Frenchwoman Celeste, a splendid\r\npantomimist, and her emotional \"Wept of the Wishton-Wish.\" But certainly\r\nthe main \"reason for being\" of the Bowery Theatre those years was to\r\nfurnish the public with Forrest's and Booth's performances--the latter\r\nhaving a popularity and circles of enthusiastic admirers and critics\r\nfully equal to the former--though people were divided as always. For\r\nsome reason or other, neither Forrest nor Booth would accept engagements\r\nat the more fashionable theatre, the Park. And it is a curious\r\nreminiscence, but a true one, that both these great actors and their\r\nperformances were taboo'd by \"polite society\" in New York and Boston\r\nat the time--probably as being too robustuous. But no such scruples\r\naffected the Bowery.\r\n\r\nRecalling from that period the occasion of either Forrest or Booth,\r\nany good night at the old Bowery, pack'd from ceiling to pit with\r\nits audience mainly of alert, well-dress'd, full-blooded young and\r\nmiddle-aged men, the best average of American-born mechanics--the\r\nemotional nature of the whole mass arous'd by the power and magnetism\r\nof as mighty mimes as ever trod the stage--the whole crowded auditorium,\r\nand what seeth'd in it, and flush'd from its faces and eyes, to me\r\nas much a part of the show as any--bursting forth in one of those\r\nlong-kept-up tempests of hand-clapping peculiar to the Bowery--no dainty\r\nkid-glove business, but electric force and muscle from perhaps 2,000\r\nfull-sinew'd men--(the inimitable and chromatic tempest of one of those\r\novations to Edwin Forrest, welcoming him back after an absence, comes up\r\nto me this moment)--Such sounds and scenes as here resumed will surely\r\nafford to many old New Yorkers some fruitful recollections.\r\n\r\nI can yet remember (for I always scann'd an audience as rigidly as\r\na play) the faces of the leading authors, poets, editors, of those\r\ntimes--Fenimore Cooper, Bryant, Paulding, Irving, Charles King, Watson\r\nWebb, N. P. Willis, Hoffman, Halleck, Mumford, Morris, Leggett, L. G.\r\nClarke, R. A. Locke and others, occasionally peering from the first tier\r\nboxes; and even the great National Eminences, Presidents Adams, Jackson,\r\nVan Buren and Tyler, all made short visits there on their Eastern tours.\r\n\r\nAwhile after 1840 the character of the Bowery as hitherto described\r\ncompletely changed. Cheap prices and vulgar programmes came in. People\r\nwho of after years saw the pandemonium of the pit and the doings on the\r\nboards must not gauge by them the times and characters I am describing.\r\nNot but what there was more or less rankness in the crowd even then. For\r\ntypes of sectional New York those days--the streets East of the Bowery,\r\nthat intersect Division, Grand, and up to Third avenue--types that\r\nnever found their Dickens, or Hogarth, or Balzac, and have pass'd away\r\nunportraitured--the young ship-builders, cartmen, butchers, firemen (the\r\nold-time \"soap-lock\" or exaggerated \"Mose\" or \"Sikesey,\" of Chanfrau's\r\nplays,) they, too, were always to be seen in these audiences, racy of\r\nthe East river and the Dry Dock. Slang, wit, occasional shirt sleeves,\r\nand a picturesque freedom of looks and manners, with a rude good-nature\r\nand restless movement, were generally noticeable. Yet there never were\r\naudiences that paid a good actor or an interesting play the compliment\r\nof more sustain'd attention or quicker rapport. Then at times came the\r\nexceptionally decorous and intellectual congregations I have hinted it;\r\nfor the Bowery really furnish'd plays and players you could get nowhere\r\nelse. Notably, Booth always drew the best hearers; and to a specimen of\r\nhis acting I will now attend in some detail.\r\n\r\nI happen'd to see what has been reckon'd by experts one of the most\r\nmarvellous pieces of histrionism ever known. It must have been about\r\n1834 or '35. A favorite comedian and actress at the Bowery, Thomas Flynn\r\nand his wife, were to have a joint benefit, and, securing Booth for\r\nRichard, advertised the fact many days beforehand. The house fill'd\r\nearly from top to bottom. There was some uneasiness behind the scenes,\r\nfor the afternoon arrived, and Booth had not come from down in Maryland,\r\nwhere he lived. However, a few minutes before ringing-up time he made\r\nhis appearance in lively condition.\r\n\r\nAfter a one-act farce over, as contrast and prelude, the curtain rising\r\nfor the tragedy, I can, from my good seat in the pit, pretty well front,\r\nsee again Booth's quiet entrance from the side, as, with head bent, he\r\nslowly and in silence, (amid the tempest of boisterous hand-clapping,)\r\nwalks down the stage to the footlights with that peculiar and abstracted\r\ngesture, musingly kicking his sword, which he holds off from him by its\r\nsash. Though fifty years have pass'd since then, I can hear the clank,\r\nand feel the perfect following hush of perhaps three thousand people\r\nwaiting. (I never saw an actor who could make more of the said hush\r\nor wait, and hold the audience in an indescribable, half-delicious,\r\nhalf-irritating suspense.) And so throughout the entire play, all parts,\r\nvoice, atmosphere, magnetism, from\r\n\r\n    \"Now is the winter of our discontent,\"\r\n\r\nto the closing death fight with Richmond, were of the finest and\r\ngrandest. The latter character was play'd by a stalwart young fellow\r\nnamed Ingersoll. Indeed, all the renderings were wonderfully good.\r\nBut the great spell cast upon the mass of hearers came from Booth.\r\nEspecially was the dream scene very impressive. A shudder went through\r\nevery nervous system in the audience; it certainly did through mine.\r\n\r\nWithout question Booth was royal heir and legitimate representative of\r\nthe Garrick-Kemble-Siddons dramatic traditions; but he vitalized and\r\ngave an unnamable _race_ to those traditions with his own electric\r\npersonal idiosyncrasy. (As in all art-utterance it was the subtle and\r\npowerful something _special to the individual_ that really conquer'd.)\r\n\r\nTo me, too, Booth stands for much else besides theatricals. I consider\r\nthat my seeing the man those years glimps'd for me, beyond all else,\r\nthat inner spirit and form--the unquestionable charm and vivacity, but\r\nintrinsic sophistication and artificiality--crystallizing rapidly upon\r\nthe English stage and literature at and after Shakspere's time,\r\nand coming on accumulatively through the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies to the beginning, fifty or forty years ago, of those\r\ndisintegrating, decomposing processes now authoritatively going on. Yes;\r\nalthough Booth must be class'd in that antique, almost extinct school,\r\ninflated, stagy, rendering Shakspere (perhaps inevitably, appropriately)\r\nfrom the growth of arbitrary and often cockney conventions, his genius\r\nwas to me one of the grandest revelations of my life, a lesson of\r\nartistic expression. The words fire, energy, _abandon_, found in him\r\nunprecedented meanings. I never heard a speaker or actor who could give\r\nsuch a sting to hauteur or the taunt. I never heard from any other the\r\ncharm of unswervingly perfect vocalization without trenching at all on\r\nmere melody, the province of music.\r\n\r\nSo much for a Thespian temple of New York fifty years since, where\r\n\"sceptred tragedy went trailing by\" under the gaze of the Dry Dock\r\nyouth, and both players and auditors were of a character and like we\r\nshall never see again. And so much for the grandest histrion of modern\r\ntimes, as near as I can deliberately judge (and the phrenologists put\r\nmy \"caution\" at 7)--grander, I believe, than Kean in the expression of\r\nelectric passion, the prime eligibility of the tragic artist. For\r\nthough those brilliant years had many fine and even magnificent actors,\r\nundoubtedly at Booth's death (in 1852) went the last and by far the\r\nnoblest Roman of them all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO LATE ENGLISH BOOKS\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE READER IN THE BRITISH ISLANDS--\"Specimen Days in\r\nAmerica\"\r\n\r\nLondon Edition, _June 1887_ If you will only take the following pages,\r\nas you do some long and gossippy letter written for you by a relative or\r\nfriend travelling through distant scenes and incidents and jotting\r\nthem down lazily and informally, but ever veraciously (with occasional\r\ndiversion of critical thought about sombody or something,) it might\r\nremove all formal or literary impediments at once, and bring you and me\r\ncloser together in the spirt in which the jottings were collated to\r\nbe read. You have had, and have, plenty of public events and facts\r\nand general statistics of America;--in the following book is a common\r\nindividual New World _private life_, its birth and growth, its struggles\r\nfor a living, its goings and comings and observations (or representative\r\nportions of them) amid the United States of America the last thirty or\r\nforty years, with their varied war and peace, their local coloring, the\r\nunavoidable egotism, and the lights and shades and sights and joys and\r\npains and sympathies common to humanity. Further introductory light may\r\nbe found in the paragraph, \"A Happy Hour's Command,\" and the bottom note\r\nbelonging to it at the beginning of the book. I have said in the text\r\nthat if I were required to give good reason-for-being of \"Specimen\r\nDays,\" I should be unable to do so. Let me fondly hope that it has at\r\nleast the reason and excuse of such off-hand gossippy letter as just\r\nalluded to, portraying American life-sights and incidents as they\r\nactually occurred--their presentation, making additions as far as it\r\ngoes, to the simple experience and association of your soul, from a\r\ncomrade soul;--and that also, in the volume, as below any page of mine,\r\nanywhere, ever remains, for seen or unseen basis-phrase, GOOD-WILL\r\nBETWEEN THE COMMON PEOPLE OF ALL NATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL NOTE, 1887\r\n\r\n_To English Edition \"Specimen Days\"_\r\n\r\nAs I write these lines I still continue living in Camden, New Jersey,\r\nAmerica. Coming this way from Washington city, on my road to the\r\nsea-shore (and a temporary rest, as I supposed) in the early summer\r\nof 1873, I broke down disabled, and have dwelt here, as my central\r\nresidence, all the time since--almost 14 years. In the preceding pages\r\nI have described how, during those years, I partially recuperated (in\r\n1876) from my worst paralysis by going down to Timber creek, living\r\nclose to Nature, and domiciling with my dear friends George and Susan\r\nStafford. From 1877 or '8 to '83 or '4 I was well enough to travel\r\naround, considerably--journey'd westward to Kansas, leisurely exploring\r\nthe Prairies, and on to Denver and the Rocky Mountains; another time\r\nnorth to Canada, where I spent most of the summer with my friend Dr.\r\nBucke, and jaunted along the great lakes, and the St. Lawrence and\r\nSaguenay rivers; another time to Boston, to properly print the final\r\nedition of my poems (I was there over two months, and had a \"good\r\ntime.\") I have so brought out the completed \"Leaves of Grass\" during\r\nthis period; also \"Specimen Days,\" of which the foregoing is a\r\ntranscript; collected and re-edited the \"Democratic Vistas\" cluster (see\r\ncompanion volume to the present)--commemorated Abraham Lincoln's death,\r\non the successive anniversaries of its occurrence, by delivering my\r\nlecture on it ten or twelve times; and \"put in,\" through many a month\r\nand season, the aimless and resultless ways of most human lives.\r\n\r\nThus the last 14 years have pass'd. At present (end-days of March,\r\n1887--I am nigh entering my 69th year) I find myself continuing on here,\r\nquite dilapidated and even wreck'd bodily from the paralysis, &c.--but\r\nin _good heart_ (to use a Long Island country phrase,) and with about\r\nthe same mentality as ever. The worst of it is, I have been growing\r\nfeebler quite rapidly for a year, and now can't walk around--hardly from\r\none room to the next. I am forced to stay in-doors and in my big chair\r\nnearly all the time. We have had a sharp, dreary winter too, and it has\r\npinch'd me. I am alone most of the time; every week, indeed almost every\r\nday, write some--reminiscences, essays, sketches, for the magazines;\r\nand read, or rather I should say dawdle over books and papers a good\r\ndeal--spend half the day at that.\r\n\r\nNor can I finish this note without putting on record--wafting over sea\r\nfrom hence--my deepest thanks to certain friends and helpers (I would\r\nspecify them all and each by name, but imperative reasons, outside of\r\nmy own wishes, forbid,) in the British Islands, as well as in America.\r\nDear, even in the abstract, is such flattering unction always no doubt\r\nto the soul! Nigher still, if possible, I myself have been, and am\r\nto-day indebted to such help for my very sustenance, clothing, shelter,\r\nand continuity. And I would not go to the grave without briefly, but\r\nplainly, as I here do, acknowledging--may I not say even glorying in it?\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO \"DEMOCRATIC VISTAS\" WITH OTHER PAPERS--_English Edition_\r\n\r\nMainly I think I should base the request to weigh the following pages on\r\nthe assumption that they present, however indirectly, some views of\r\nthe West and Modern, or of a distinctly western and modern (American)\r\ntendency, about certain matters. Then, too, the pages include (by\r\nattempting to illustrate it,) a theory herein immediately mentioned. For\r\nanother and different point of the issue, the Enlightenment, Democracy\r\nand Fair-show of the bulk, the common people of America (from sources\r\nrepresenting not only the British Islands, but all the world,) means,\r\nat least, eligibility to Enlightenment, Democracy and Fair-show for the\r\nbulk, the common people of all civilized nations.\r\n\r\nThat positively \"the dry land has appeared,\" at any rate, is an\r\nimportant fact.\r\n\r\nAmerica is really the great test or trial case for all the problems and\r\npromises and speculations of humanity, and of the past and present.\r\n\r\nI say, too, we[41] are not to look so much to changes, ameliorations,\r\nand adaptations in Politics as to those of Literature and (thence)\r\ndomestic Sociology. I have accordingly in the following melange\r\nintroduced many themes besides political ones.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the pieces are ostensibly in explanation of my own writings;\r\nbut in that very process they best include and set forth their side of\r\nprinciples and generalities pressing vehemently for consideration our\r\nage.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, it is on the atmosphere they are born in, and, (I hope)\r\ngive out, more than any specific piece or trait, I would care to rest.\r\n\r\nI think Literature--a new, superb, democratic literature--is to be\r\nthe medicine and lever, and (with Art) the chief influence in modern\r\ncivilization. I have myself not so much made a dead set at this theory,\r\nor attempted to present it directly, as admitted it to color and\r\nsometimes dominate what I had to say. In both Europe and America we have\r\nserried phalanxes who promulge and defend the political claims: I go for\r\nan equal force to uphold the other.\r\n\r\nWALT WHITMAN,\r\n\r\nCAMDEN, NEW JERSEY, _April, 1888_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n[41] We who, in many departments, ways, make _the building up of the\r\nmasses,_ by _building up grand individuals_, our shibboleth: and in\r\nbrief that is the marrow of this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN\r\n\r\n\r\nGlad am I to give--were anything better lacking--even the most brief\r\nand shorn testimony of Abraham Lincoln. Everything I heard about him\r\nauthentically, and every time I saw him (and it was my fortune through\r\n1862 to '65 to see, or pass a word with, or watch him, personally,\r\nperhaps twenty or thirty times,) added to and anneal'd my respect and\r\nlove at the moment. And as I dwell on what I myself heard or saw of the\r\nmighty Westerner, and blend it with the history and literature of my\r\nage, and of what I can get of all ages, and conclude it with his death,\r\nit seems like some tragic play, superior to all else I know--vaster and\r\nfierier and more convulsionary, for this America of ours, than Eschylus\r\nor Shakspere ever drew for Athens or for England. And then the Moral\r\npermeating, underlying all! the Lesson that none so remote--none so\r\nilliterate--no age, no class--but may directly or indirectly read!\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln's was really one of those characters, the best of which\r\nis the result of long trains of cause and effect--needing a certain\r\nspaciousness of time, and perhaps even remoteness, to properly enclose\r\nthem--having unequal'd influence on the shaping of this Republic (and\r\ntherefore the world) as to-day, and then far more important in\r\nthe future. Thus the time has by no means yet come for a thorough\r\nmeasurement of him. Nevertheless, we who live in his era--who have\r\nseen him, and heard him, face to face, and are in the midst of, or just\r\nparting from, the strong and strange events which he and we have had\r\nto do with--can in some respects bear valuable, perhaps indispensable\r\ntestimony concerning him.\r\n\r\nI should first like to give a very fair and characteristic likeness of\r\nLincoln, as I saw him and watch'd him one afternoon in Washington, for\r\nnearly half an hour, not long before his death. It was as he stood on\r\nthe balcony of the National Hotel, Pennsylvania avenue, making a short\r\nspeech to the crowd in front, on the occasion either of a set of\r\nnew colors presented to a famous Illinois regiment, or of the daring\r\ncapture, by the Western men, of some flags from \"the enemy,\" (which\r\nlatter phrase, by the by, was not used by him at all in his remarks.)\r\nHow the picture happen'd to be made I do not know, but I bought it a few\r\ndays afterward in Washington, and it was endors'd by every one to whom I\r\nshow'd it. Though hundreds of portraits have been made, by painters and\r\nphotographers, (many to pass on, by copies, to future times,) I have\r\nnever seen one yet that in my opinion deserv'd to be called a perfectly\r\n_good likeness_; nor do I believe there is really such a one in\r\nexistence. May I not say too, that, as there is no entirely competent\r\nand emblematic likeness of Abraham Lincoln in picture or statue, there\r\nis not--perhaps cannot be--any fully appropriate literary statement or\r\nsumming-up of him yet in existence?\r\n\r\nThe best way to estimate the value of Lincoln is to think what the\r\ncondition of America would be to-day, if he had never lived--never been\r\nPresident. His nomination and first election were mainly accidents,\r\nexperiments. Severely view'd, one cannot think very much of American\r\nPolitical Parties, from the beginning, after the Revolutionary War, down\r\nto the present time. Doubtless, while they have had their uses--have\r\nbeen and are \"the grass on which the cow feeds\"--and indispensable\r\neconomies of growth--it is undeniable that under flippant names they\r\nhave merely identified temporary passions, or freaks, or sometimes\r\nprejudice, ignorance, or hatred. The only thing like a great and worthy\r\nidea vitalizing a party, and making it heroic, was the enthusiasm in '64\r\nfor re-electing Abraham Lincoln, and the reason behind that enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nHow does this man compare with the acknowledg'd \"Father of his country\"?\r\nWashington was model'd on the best Saxon, and Franklin--of the age of\r\nthe Stuarts (rooted in the Elizabethan period)--was essentially a noble\r\nEnglishman, and just the kind needed for the occasions and the times of\r\n1776-'83. Lincoln, underneath his practicality, was far less European,\r\nwas quite thoroughly Western, original, essentially non-conventional,\r\nand had a certain sort of out-door or prairie stamp. One of the best of\r\nthe late commentators on Shakspere, (Professor Dowden,) makes the height\r\nand aggregate of his quality as a poet to be, that he thoroughly blended\r\nthe ideal with the practical or realistic. If this be so, I should\r\nsay that what Shakspere did in poetic expression, Abraham Lincoln\r\nessentially did in his personal and official life. I should say the\r\ninvisible foundations and vertebra of his character, more than any man's\r\nin history, were mystical, abstract, moral and spiritual--while upon all\r\nof them was built, and out of all of them radiated, under the control of\r\nthe average of circumstances, what the vulgar call _horse-sense_, and a\r\nlife often bent by temporary but most urgent materialistic and political\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\nHe seems to have been a man of indomitable firmness (even obstinacy) on\r\nrare occasions, involving great points; but he was generally very easy,\r\nflexible, tolerant, almost slouchy, respecting minor matters. I note\r\nthat even those reports and anecdotes intended to level him down, all\r\nleave the tinge of a favorable impression of him. As to his religious\r\nnature, it seems to me to have certainly been of the amplest,\r\ndeepest-rooted, loftiest kind.\r\n\r\nAlready a new generation begins to tread the stage, since the persons\r\nand events of the secession war. I have more than once fancied to myself\r\nthe time when the present century has closed, and a new one open'd,\r\nand the men and deeds of that contest have become somewhat vague and\r\nmythical-fancied perhaps in some great Western city, or group collected\r\ntogether, or public festival, where the days of old, of 1863, and '4 and\r\n'5 are discuss'd--some ancient soldier sitting in the background as the\r\ntalk goes on, and betraying himself by his emotion and moist eyes--like\r\nthe journeying Ithacan at the banquet of King Alcinoiis, when the bard\r\nsings the contending warriors and their battles on the plains of Troy:\r\n\r\n    \"So from the sluices of Ulysses' eyes\r\n    Fast fell the tears, and sighs succeeded sighs.\"\r\n\r\nI have fancied, I say, some such venerable relic of this time of ours,\r\npreserv'd to the next or still the next generation of America. I have\r\nfancied, on such occasion, the young men gathering around; the awe, the\r\neager questions: \"What! have you seen Abraham Lincoln--and heard him\r\nspeak--and touch'd his hand? Have you, with your own eyes, look'd on\r\nGrant, and Lee, and Sherman?\"\r\n\r\nDear to Democracy, to the very last! And among the paradoxes generated\r\nby America, not the least curious was that spectacle of all the kings\r\nand queens and emperors of the earth, many from remote distances,\r\nsending tributes of condolence and sorrow in memory of one rais'd\r\nthrough the commonest average of life--a rail-splitter and flat-boatman!\r\n\r\nConsider'd from contemporary points of view--who knows what the future\r\nmay decide?--and from the points of view of current Democracy and The\r\nUnion, (the only thing like passion or infatuation in the man was the\r\npassion for the Union of These States,) Abraham Lincoln seems to me\r\nthe grandest figure yet, on all the crowded canvas of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW ORLEANS IN 1848\r\n\r\n_Walt Whitman gossips of his sojourn here years ago as a newspaper\r\nwriter. Notes of his trip up the Mississippi and to New York._\r\n\r\nAmong the letters brought this morning (Camden, New Jersey, Jan. 15,\r\n1887,) by my faithful post-office carrier, J.G., is one as follows:\r\n\r\n\"NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 11, '87.--We have been informed that when you were\r\nyounger and less famous than now, you were in New Orleans and perhaps\r\nhave helped on the _Picayune_. If you have any remembrance of the\r\n_Picayune's_ young days, or of journalism in New Orleans of that era,\r\nand would put it in writing (verse or prose) for the _Picayune's_\r\nfiftieth year edition, Jan. 25, we shall be pleased,\" etc.\r\n\r\nIn response to which: I went down to New Orleans early in 1848 to work\r\non a daily newspaper, but it was not the _Picayune_, though I saw quite\r\na good deal of the editors of that paper, and knew its personnel and\r\nways. But let me indulge my pen in some gossipy recollections of that\r\ntime and place, with extracts from my journal up the Mississippi and\r\nacross the great lakes to the Hudson.\r\n\r\nProbably the influence most deeply pervading everything at that time\r\nthrough the United States, both in physical facts and in sentiment, was\r\nthe Mexican War, then just ended. Following a brilliant campaign (in\r\nwhich our troops had march'd to the capital city, Mexico, and taken full\r\npossession,) we were returning after our victory. From the situation of\r\nthe country, the city of New Orleans had been our channel and _entrepot_\r\nfor everything, going and returning. It had the best news and war\r\ncorrespondents; it had the most to say, through its leading papers, the\r\n_Picayune_ and _Delta_ especially, and its voice was readiest listen'd\r\nto; from it \"Chapparal\" had gone out, and his army and battle letters\r\nwere copied everywhere, not only in the United States, but in Europe.\r\nThen the social cast and results; no one who has never seen the society\r\nof a city under similar circumstances can understand what a strange\r\nvivacity and _rattle_ were given throughout by such a situation. I\r\nremember the crowds of soldiers, the gay young officers, going or\r\ncoming, the receipt of important news, the many discussions, the\r\nreturning wounded, and so on.\r\n\r\nI remember very well seeing Gen. Taylor with his staff and other\r\nofficers at the St. Charles Theatre one evening (after talking with them\r\nduring the day.) There was a short play on the stage, but the principal\r\nperformance was of Dr. Colyer's troupe of \"Model Artists,\" then in\r\nthe full tide of their popularity. They gave many fine groups and solo\r\nshows. The house was crowded with uniforms and shoulder-straps. Gen. T.\r\nhimself, if I remember right, was almost the only officer in civilian\r\nclothes; he was a jovial, old, rather stout, plain man, with a wrinkled\r\nand dark-yellow face, and, in ways and manners, show'd the least of\r\nconventional ceremony or etiquette I ever saw; he laugh'd unrestrainedly\r\nat everything comical. (He had a great personal resemblance to Fenimore\r\nCooper, the novelist, of New York.) I remember Gen. Pillow and quite a\r\ncluster of other militaires also present.\r\n\r\nOne of my choice amusements during my stay in New Orleans was going down\r\nto the old French Market, especially of a Sunday morning. The show was\r\na varied and curious one; among the rest, the Indian and negro hucksters\r\nwith their wares. For there were always fine specimens of Indians,\r\nboth men and women, young and old. I remember I nearly always on these\r\noccasions got a large cup of delicious coffee with a biscuit, for my\r\nbreakfast, from the immense shining copper kettle of a great Creole\r\nmulatto woman (I believe she weigh'd 230 pounds.) I never have had\r\nsuch coffee since. About nice drinks, anyhow, my recollection of the\r\n\"cobblers\" (with strawberries and snow on top of the large tumblers,)\r\nand also the exquisite wines, and the perfect and mild French brandy,\r\nhelp the regretful reminiscence of my New Orleans experiences of those\r\ndays. And what splendid and roomy and leisurely bar-rooms! particularly\r\nthe grand ones of the St. Charles and St. Louis. Bargains, auctions,\r\nappointments, business conferences, &c., were generally held in the\r\nspaces or recesses of these bar-rooms.\r\n\r\nI used to wander a midday hour or two now and then for amusement on the\r\ncrowded and bustling levees, on the banks of the river. The diagonally\r\nwedg'd-in boats, the stevedores, the piles of cotton and other\r\nmerchandise, the carts, mules, negroes, etc., afforded never-ending\r\nstudies and sights to me. I made acquaintances among the captains,\r\nboatmen, or other characters, and often had long talks with\r\nthem--sometimes finding a real rough diamond among my chance encounters.\r\nSundays I sometimes went forenoons to the old Catholic Cathedral in the\r\nFrench quarter. I used to walk a good deal in this arrondissement; and I\r\nhave deeply regretted since that I did not cultivate, while I had such\r\na good opportunity, the chance of better knowledge of French and Spanish\r\nCreole New Orleans people. (I have an idea that there is much and of\r\nimportance about the Latin race contributions to American nationality\r\nin the South and Southwest that will never be put with sympathetic\r\nunderstanding and tact on record.)\r\n\r\nLet me say, for better detail, that through several months (1848) I\r\nwork'd on a new daily paper, _The Crescent_; my situation rather a\r\npleasant one. My young brother, Jeff, was with me; and he not only grew\r\nvery homesick, but the climate of the place, and especially the water,\r\nseriously disagreed with him. From this and other reasons (although I\r\nwas quite happily fix'd) I made no very long stay in the South. In due\r\ntime we took passage northward for St. Louis in the \"Pride of the West\"\r\nsteamer, which left her wharf just at dusk. My brother was unwell,\r\nand lay in his berth from the moment we left till the next morning; he\r\nseem'd to me to be in a fever, and I felt alarm'd. However, the next\r\nmorning he was all right again, much to my relief.\r\n\r\nOur voyage up the Mississippi was after the same sort as the voyage,\r\nsome months before, down it. The shores of this great river are very\r\nmonotonous and dull--one continuous and rank flat, with the exception of\r\na meagre stretch of bluff, about the neighborhood of Natchez,\r\nMemphis, &c. Fortunately we had good weather, and not a great crowd of\r\npassengers, though the berths were all full. The \"Pride\" jogg'd along\r\npretty well, and put us into St. Louis about noon Saturday. After\r\nlooking around a little I secured passage on the steamer \"Prairie Bird,\"\r\n(to leave late in the afternoon,) bound up the Illinois river to La\r\nSalle, where we were to take canal for Chicago. During the day I rambled\r\nwith my brother over a large portion of the town, search'd after a\r\nrefectory, and, after much trouble, succeeded in getting some dinner.\r\n\r\nOur \"Prairie Bird\" started out at dark, and a couple of hours after\r\nthere was quite a rain and blow, which made them haul in along shore\r\nand tie fast. We made but thirty miles the whole night. The boat was\r\nexcessively crowded with passengers, and had withal so much freight that\r\nwe could hardly turn around. I slept on the floor, and the night was\r\nuncomfortable enough. The Illinois river is spotted with little villages\r\nwith big names, Marseilles, Naples, etc.; its banks are low, and the\r\nvegetation excessively rank. Peoria, some distance up, is a pleasant\r\ntown; I went over the place; the country back is all rich land, for sale\r\ncheap. Three or four miles from P., land of the first quality can be\r\nbought for $3 or $4 an acre. (I am transcribing from my notes written at\r\nthe time.)\r\n\r\nArriving at La Salle Tuesday morning, we went on board a canal-boat, had\r\na detention by sticking on a mud bar, and then jogg'd along at a slow\r\ntrot, some seventy of us, on a moderate-sized boat. (If the weather\r\nhadn't been rather cool, particularly at night, it would have been\r\ninsufferable.) Illinois is the most splendid agricultural country I ever\r\nsaw; the land is of surpassing richness; the place par excellence for\r\nfarmers. We stopt at various points along the canal, some of them pretty\r\nvillages.\r\n\r\nIt was 10 o'clock A.M. when we got in Chicago, too late for the steamer;\r\nso we went to an excellent public house, the \"American Temperance,\" and\r\nI spent the time that day and till next morning, looking around Chicago.\r\n\r\nAt 9 the next forenoon we started on the \"Griffith\" (on board of which I\r\nam now inditing these memoranda,) up the blue waters of Lake Michigan.\r\nI was delighted with the appearance of the towns along Wisconsin. At\r\nMilwaukee I went on shore, and walk'd around the place. They say the\r\ncountry back is beautiful and rich. (It seems to me that if we should\r\never remove from Long Island, Wisconsin would be the proper place to\r\ncome to.) The towns have a remarkable appearance of good living, without\r\nany penury or want. The country is so good naturally, and labor is in\r\nsuch demand.\r\n\r\nAbout 5 o'clock one afternoon I heard the cry of \"a woman over-board.\"\r\nIt proved to be a crazy lady, who had become so from the loss of her\r\nson a couple of weeks before. The small boat put off, and succeeded in\r\npicking her up, though she had been in the water 15 minutes. She was\r\ndead. Her husband was on board. They went off at the next stopping\r\nplace. While she lay in the water she probably recover'd her reason, as\r\nshe toss'd up her arms and lifted her face toward the boat.\r\n\r\n_Sunday Morning, June 11_.--We pass'd down Lake Huron yesterday and last\r\nnight, and between 4 and 5 o'clock this morning we ran on the \"flats,\"\r\nand have been vainly trying, with the aid of a steam tug and a lumbering\r\nlighter, to get clear again. The day is beautiful and the water clear\r\nand calm. Night before last we stopt at Mackinaw, (the island and\r\ntown,) and I went up on the old fort, one of the oldest stations in\r\nthe Northwest. We expect to get to Buffalo by to-morrow. The tug has\r\nfasten'd lines to us, but some have been snapt and the others have no\r\neffect. We seem to be firmly imbedded in the sand. (With the exception\r\nof a larger boat and better accommodations, it amounts to about the\r\nsame thing as a becalmment I underwent on the Montauk voyage, East\r\nLong Island, last summer.) _Later_.--We are off again--expect to reach\r\nDetroit before dinner.\r\n\r\nWe did not stop at Detroit. We are now on Lake Erie, jogging along at\r\na good round pace. A couple of hours since we were on the river above.\r\nDetroit seem'd to me a pretty place and thrifty. I especially liked\r\nthe looks of the Canadian shore opposite and of the little village\r\nof Windsor, and, indeed, all along the banks of the river. From the\r\nshrubbery and the neat appearance of some of the cottages, I think it\r\nmust have been settled by the French. While I now write we can see a\r\nlittle distance ahead the scene of the battle between Perry's fleet and\r\nthe British during the last war with England. The lake looks to me a\r\nfine sheet of water. We are having a beautiful day.\r\n\r\n_June 12_.--We stopt last evening at Cleveland, and though it was dark,\r\nI took the opportunity of rambling about the place; went up in the heart\r\nof the city and back to what appear'd to be the courthouse. The streets\r\nare unusually wide, and the buildings appear to be substantial and\r\ncomfortable. We went down through Main street and found, some distance\r\nalong, several squares of ground very prettily planted with trees and\r\nlooking attractive enough. Return'd to the boat by way of the lighthouse\r\non the hill.\r\n\r\nThis morning we are making for Buffalo, being, I imagine, a little more\r\nthan half across Lake Erie. The water is rougher than on Michigan or\r\nHuron. (On St. Clair it was smooth as glass.) The day is bright and dry,\r\nwith a stiff head wind.\r\n\r\nWe arriv'd in Buffalo on Monday evening; spent that night and a portion\r\nof next day going round the city exploring. Then got in the cars and\r\nwent to Niagara; went under the falls--saw the whirlpool and all the\r\nother sights.\r\n\r\nTuesday night started for Albany; travel'd all night. From the time\r\ndaylight afforded us a view of the country all seem'd very rich and well\r\ncultivated. Every few miles were large towns or villages.\r\n\r\nWednesday late we arriv'd at Albany. Spent the evening in exploring.\r\nThere was a political meeting (Hunker) at the capitol, but I pass'd\r\nit by. Next morning I started down the Hudson in the \"Alida;\" arriv'd\r\nsafely in New York that evening.\r\n\r\n_From the New Orleans Picayune, Jan. 25, 1887._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALL MEMORANDA\r\n\r\n_Thousands lost--here one or two preserv'd_\r\n\r\n\r\nATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, _Washington, Aug. 22, 1865_.--As I write\r\nthis, about noon, the suite of rooms here is fill'd with Southerners,\r\nstanding in squads, or streaming in and out, some talking with\r\nthe Pardon Clerk, some waiting to see the Attorney General, others\r\ndiscussing in low tones among themselves. All are mainly anxious about\r\ntheir pardons. The famous 13th exception of the President's Amnesty\r\nProclamation of ----, makes it necessary that every secessionist, whose\r\nproperty is worth $20,000 or over, shall get a special pardon, before he\r\ncan transact any legal purchase, sale, &c. So hundreds and thousands of\r\nsuch property owners have either sent up here, for the last two months,\r\nor have been, or are now coming personally here, to get their pardons.\r\nThey are from Virginia, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, North and South\r\nCarolina, and every Southern State. Some of their written petitions are\r\nvery abject. Secession officers of the rank of Brigadier General, or\r\nhigher, also need these special pardons. They also come here. I see\r\nstreams of the $20,000 men, (and some women,) every day. I talk now and\r\nthen with them, and learn much that is interesting and significant. All\r\nthe southern women that come (some splendid specimens, mothers, &c.) are\r\ndress'd in deep black.\r\n\r\nImmense numbers (several thousands) of these pardons have been pass'd\r\nupon favorably; the Pardon Warrants (like great deeds) have been issued\r\nfrom the State Department, on the requisition of this office. But for\r\nsome reason or other, they nearly all yet lie awaiting the President's\r\nsignature. He seems to be in no hurry about it, but lets them wait.\r\n\r\nThe crowds that come here make a curious study for me. I get along, very\r\nsociably, with any of them--as I let them do all the talking; only now\r\nand then I have a long confab, or ask a suggestive question or two.\r\n\r\nIf the thing continues as at present, the property and wealth of the\r\nSouthern States is going to legally rest, for the future, on these\r\npardons. Every single one is made out with the condition that the\r\ngrantee shall respect the abolition of slavery, and never make an\r\nattempt to restore it.\r\n\r\n_Washington, Sept. 8, 9, &c., 1865_.--The arrivals, swarms, &c., of the\r\n$20,000 men seeking pardons, still continue with increas'd numbers and\r\npertinacity. I yesterday (I am a clerk in the U. S. Attorney General's\r\noffice here) made out a long list from Alabama, nearly 200, recommended\r\nfor pardon by the Provisional Governor. This list, in the shape of a\r\nrequisition from the Attorney General, goes to the State Department.\r\nThere the Pardon Warrants are made out, brought back here, and then sent\r\nto the President, where they await his signature. He is signing them\r\nvery freely of late.\r\n\r\nThe President, indeed, as at present appears, has fix'd his mind on a\r\nvery generous and forgiving course toward the return'd secessionists.\r\nHe will not countenance at all the demand of the extreme Philo-African\r\nelement of the North, to make the right of negro voting at elections a\r\ncondition and sine qua non of the reconstruction of the United States\r\nsouth, and of their resumption of co-equality in the Union.\r\n\r\n\r\nA GLINT INSIDE OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S CABINET APPOINTMENTS. ONE ITEM OF\r\nMANY.\r\n\r\nWhile it was hanging in suspense who should be appointed Secretary of\r\nthe Interior, (to take the place of Caleb Smith,) the choice was very\r\nclose between Mr. Harlan and Col. Jesse K. Dubois, of Illinois. The\r\nlatter had many friends. He was competent, he was honest, and he was a\r\nman. Mr. Harlan, in the race, finally gain'd the Methodist interest, and\r\ngot himself to be consider'd as identified with it; and his appointment\r\nwas apparently ask'd for by that powerful body. Bishop Simpson, of\r\nPhiladephia, came on and spoke for the selection. The President was\r\nmuch perplex'd. The reasons for appointing Col. Dubois were very strong,\r\nalmost insuperable--yet the argument for Mr. Harlan, under the adroit\r\nposition he had plac'd himself, was heavy. Those who press'd him adduc'd\r\nthe magnitude of the Methodists as a body, their loyalty, more general\r\nand genuine than any other sect--that they represented the West, and\r\nhad a right to be heard--that all or nearly all the other great\r\ndenominations had their representatives in the heads of the\r\ngovernment--that they as a body and the great sectarian power of the\r\nWest, formally ask'd Mr. Harlan's appointment--that he was of them,\r\nhaving been a Methodist minister--that it would not do to offend them,\r\nbut was highly necessary to propitiate them.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln thought deeply over the whole matter. He was in more than\r\nusual tribulation on the subject. Let it be enough to say that though\r\nMr. Harlan finally receiv'd the Secretaryship, Col. Dubois came as near\r\nbeing appointed as a man could, and not be. The decision was finally\r\nmade one night about 10 o'clock. Bishop Simpson and other clergymen\r\nand leading persons in Mr. Harlan's behalf, had been talking long and\r\nvehemently with the President. A member of Congress who was pressing\r\nCol. Dubois's claims, was in waiting. The President had told the Bishop\r\nthat he would make a decision that evening, and that he thought it\r\nunnecessary to be press'd any more on the subject. That night he call'd\r\nin the M.C. above alluded to, and said to him: \"Tell Uncle Jesse that\r\nI want to give him this appointment, and yet I cannot. I will do almost\r\nanything else in the world for him I am able. I have thought the matter\r\nall over, and under the circumstances think the Methodists too good and\r\ntoo great a body to be slighted. They have stood by the government, and\r\nhelp'd us their very best. I have had no better friends; and as the case\r\nstands, I have decided to appoint Mr. Harlan.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE TO A FRIEND\r\n\r\n[_Written on the fly-leaf of a copy of_ Specimen Days, _sent to Peter\r\nDoyle, at Washington, June, 1883_]\r\n\r\nPete, do you remember--(of course you do--I do well)--those great long\r\njovial walks we had at times for years, (1866-'72) out of Washington\r\ncity--often moonlight nights--'way to \"Good Hope\";--or, Sundays, up and\r\ndown the Potomac shores, one side or the other, sometimes ten miles at\r\na stretch? Or when you work'd on the horse-cars, and I waited for you,\r\ncoming home late together--or resting and chatting at the Market, corner\r\n7th street and the Avenue, and eating those nice musk or watermelons?\r\nOr during my tedious sickness and first paralysis ('73) how you used to\r\ncome to my solitary garret-room and make up my bed, and enliven me,\r\nand chat for an hour or so--or perhaps go out and get the medicines Dr.\r\nDrinkard had order'd for me--before you went on duty?... Give my love\r\nto dear Mrs. and Mr. Nash, and tell them I have not forgotten them, and\r\nnever will.\r\n\r\nW.W.\r\n\r\n\r\nWRITTEN IMPROMPTU IN AN ALBUM\r\n\r\n_Germantown, Phila., Dec. 26, '83_. In memory of these merry Christmas\r\ndays and nights--to my friends Mr. and Mrs. Williams, Churchie, May,\r\nGurney, and little Aubrey.... A heavy snow-storm blocking up everything,\r\nand keeping us in. But souls, hearts, thoughts, unloos'd. And so--one\r\nand all, little and big--hav'n't we had a good time?\r\n\r\nW.W.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLACE GRATITUDE FILLS IN A FINE CHARACTER\r\n\r\n_From the Philadelphia Press, Nov. 27, 1884, (Thanksgiving number)_\r\n\r\n_Scene_.--A large family supper party, a night or two ago, with voices\r\nand laughter of the young, mellow faces of the old, and a by-and-by\r\npause in the general joviality. \"Now, Mr. Whitman,\" spoke up one of the\r\ngirls, \"what have you to say about Thanksgiving? Won't you give us a\r\nsermon in advance, to sober us down?\" The sage nodded smilingly, look'd\r\na moment at the blaze of the great wood fire, ran his forefinger right\r\nand left through the heavy white mustache that might have otherwise\r\nimpeded his voice, and began: \"Thanksgiving goes probably far deeper\r\nthan you folks suppose. I am not sure but it is the source of the\r\nhighest poetry--as in parts of the Bible. Ruskin, indeed, makes the\r\ncentral source of all great art to be praise (gratitude) to the Almighty\r\nfor life, and the universe with its objects and play of action.\r\n\r\n\"We Americans devote an official day to it every year; yet I sometimes\r\nfear the real article is almost dead or dying in our self-sufficient,\r\nindependent Republic. Gratitude, anyhow, has never been made half enough\r\nof by the moralists; it is indispensable to a complete character, man's\r\nor woman's--the disposition to be appreciative, thankful. That is the\r\nmain matter, the element, inclination--what geologists call the _trend_.\r\nOf my own life and writings I estimate the giving thanks part, with what\r\nit infers, as essentially the best item. I should say the quality of\r\ngratitude rounds the whole emotional nature; I should say love and faith\r\nwould quite lack vitality without it. There are people--shall I call\r\nthem even religious people, as things go?--who have no such trend to\r\ntheir disposition.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAST OF THE WAR CASES\r\n\r\n_Memorandized at the time, Washington, 1865-'66_\r\n\r\n\r\n[Of reminiscences of the secession war, after the rest is said, I have\r\nthought it remains to give a few special words--in some respects at the\r\ntime the typical words of all, and most definite-of the samples of the\r\nkill'd and wounded in action, and of soldiers who linger'd afterward,\r\nfrom these wounds, or were laid up by obstinate disease or prostration.\r\nThe general statistics have been printed already, but can bear to be\r\nbriefly stated again. There were over 3,000,000 men (for all periods of\r\nenlistment, large and small) furnish'd to the Union army during the war,\r\nNew York State furnishing over 500,000, which was the greatest number\r\nof any one State. The losses by disease, wounds, kill'd in action,\r\naccidents, &c., were altogether about 600,000, or approximating to that\r\nnumber. Over 4,000,000 cases were treated in the main and adjudicatory\r\narmy hospitals. The number sounds strange, but it is true. More than\r\ntwo-thirds of the deaths were from prostration or disease. To-day\r\nthere lie buried over 300,000 soldiers in the various National army\r\nCemeteries, more than half of them (and that is really the most\r\nsignificant and eloquent bequest of the war) mark'd \"unknown.\" In full\r\nmortuary statistics of the war, the greatest deficiency arises from\r\nour not having the rolls, even as far as they were kept, of most of the\r\nSouthern military prisons--a gap which probably both adds to, and helps\r\nconceal, the indescribable horrors of those places; it is, however,\r\n(restricting one vivid point only) certain that over 30,000 Union\r\nsoldiers died, largely of actual starvation, in them. And now, leaving\r\nall figures and their \"sum totals,\" I feel sure a few genuine memoranda\r\nof such things--some cases jotted down '64, '65, and '66--made at the\r\ntime and on the spot, with all the associations of those scenes and\r\nplaces brought back, will not only go directest to the right spot, but\r\ngive a clearer and more actual sight of that period, than anything else.\r\nBefore I give the last cases I begin with verbatim extracts from letters\r\nhome to my mother in Brooklyn, the second year of the war.--W.W.]\r\n\r\n_Washington, Oct. 13, 1863_.--There has been a new lot of wounded and\r\nsick arriving for the last three days. The first and second days, long\r\nstrings of ambulances with the sick. Yesterday the worst, many with bad\r\nand bloody wounds, inevitably long neglected. I thought I was cooler and\r\nmore used to it, but the sight of some cases brought tears into my eyes.\r\nI had the luck yesterday, however, to do lots of good. Had provided many\r\nnourishing articles for the men for another quarter, but, fortunately,\r\nhad my stores where I could use them at once for these new-comers, as\r\nthey arrived, faint, hungry, fagg'd out from their journey, with soil'd\r\nclothes, and all bloody. I distributed these articles, gave partly to\r\nthe nurses I knew, or to those in charge. As many as possible I fed\r\nmyself. Then I found a lot of oyster soup handy, and bought it all at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nIt is the most pitiful sight, this, when the men are first brought in,\r\nfrom some camp hospital broke up, or a part of the army moving. These\r\nwho arrived yesterday are cavalry men. Our troops had fought like\r\ndevils, but got the worst of it. They were Kilpatrick's cavalry; were\r\nin the rear, part of Meade's retreat, and the reb cavalry, knowing the\r\nground and taking a favorable opportunity, dash'd in between, cut them\r\noff, and shell'd them terribly. But Kilpatrick turn'd and brought them\r\nout mostly. It was last Sunday. (One of the most terrible sights and\r\ntasks is of such receptions.)\r\n\r\n_Oct. 27, 1863_.--If any of the soldiers I know (or their parents\r\nor folks) should call upon you--as they are often anxious to have my\r\naddress in Brooklyn--you just use them as you know how, and if you\r\nhappen to have pot-luck, and feel to ask them to take a bite, don't be\r\nafraid to do so. I have a friend, Thomas Neat, 2d N.Y. Cavalry, wounded\r\nin leg, now home in Jamaica, on furlough; he will probably call. Then\r\npossibly a Mr. Haskell, or some of his folks, from western New York: he\r\nhad a son died here, and I was with the boy a good deal. The old man and\r\nhis wife have written me and ask'd me my Brooklyn address; he said he\r\nhad children in New York, and was occasionally down there. (When I come\r\nhome I will show you some of the letters I get from mothers, sisters,\r\nfathers, &c. They will make you cry.)\r\n\r\nHow the time passes away! To think it is over a year since I left\r\nhome suddenly--and have mostly been down in front since. The year has\r\nvanish'd swiftly, and oh, what scenes I have witness'd during that time!\r\nAnd the war is not settled yet; and one does not see anything certain,\r\nor even promising, of a settlement. But I do not lose the solid feeling,\r\nin myself, that the Union triumph is assured, whether it be sooner or\r\nwhether it be later, or whatever roundabout way we may be led there;\r\nand I find I don't change that conviction from any reverses we meet, nor\r\ndelays, nor blunders. One realizes here in Washington the great labors,\r\neven the negative ones, of Lincoln; that it is a big thing to have just\r\nkept the United States from being thrown down and having its throat cut.\r\nI have not waver'd or had any doubt of the issue, since Gettysburg.\r\n\r\n_8th September, '63_.--Here, now, is a specimen army hospital case:\r\nLorenzo Strong, Co. A, 9th United States Cavalry, shot by a shell last\r\nSunday; right leg amputated on the field. Sent up here Monday night,\r\n14th. Seem'd to be doing pretty well till Wednesday noon, 16th, when he\r\ntook a turn for the worse, and a strangely rapid and fatal termination\r\nensued. Though I had much to do, I staid and saw all. It was a\r\ndeath-picture characteristic of these soldiers' hospitals--the perfect\r\nspecimen of physique, one of the most magnificent I ever saw--the\r\nconvulsive spasms and working of muscles, mouth, and throat. There are\r\ntwo good women nurses, one on each side. The doctor comes in and gives\r\nhim a little chloroform. One of the nurses constantly fans him, for\r\nit is fearfully hot. He asks to be rais'd up, and they put him in a\r\nhalf-sitting posture. He call'd for \"Mark\" repeatedly, half-deliriously,\r\nall day. Life ebbs, runs now with the speed of a mill race; his splendid\r\nneck, as it lays all open, works still, slightly; his eyes turn back.\r\nA religious person coming in offers a prayer, in subdued tones, bent at\r\nthe foot of the bed; and in the space of the aisle, a crowd, including\r\ntwo or three doctors, several students, and many soldiers, has silently\r\ngather'd. It is very still and warm, as the struggle goes on, and\r\ndwindles, a little more, and a little more--and then welcome oblivion,\r\npainlessness, death. A pause, the crowd drops away, a white bandage is\r\nbound around and under the jaw, the propping pillows are removed, the\r\nlimpsy head falls down, the arms are softly placed by the side,\r\nall composed, all still,--and the broad white sheet is thrown over\r\neverything.\r\n\r\n_April 10, 1864_.--Unusual agitation all around concentrated here.\r\nExciting times in Congress. The Copperheads are getting furious, and\r\nwant to recognize the Southern Confederacy. \"This is a pretty time to\r\ntalk of recognizing such--,\" said a Pennsylvania officer in hospital to\r\nme to-day, \"after what has transpired the last three years.\" After first\r\nFredericksburg I felt discouraged myself, and doubted whether our rulers\r\ncould carry on the war. But that has pass'd away. The war _must_ be\r\ncarried on. I would willingly go in the ranks myself if I thought it\r\nwould profit more than as at present, and I don't know sometimes but I\r\nshall, as it is. Then there is certainly a strange, deep, fervid feeling\r\nform'd or arous'd in the land, hard to describe or name; it is not a\r\nmajority feeling, but it will make itself felt. M., you don't know what\r\na nature a fellow gets, not only after being a soldier a while, but\r\nafter living in the sights and influences of the camps, the wounded,\r\n&c.--a nature he never experienced before. The stars and stripes, the\r\ntune of Yankee Doodle, and similar things, produce such an effect on\r\na fellow as never before. I have seen them bring tears on some men's\r\ncheeks, and others turn pale with emotion. I have a little flag (it\r\nbelong'd to one of our cavalry regiments,) presented to me by one of the\r\nwounded; it was taken by the secesh in a fight, and rescued by our men\r\nin a bloody skirmish following. It cost three men's lives to get back\r\nthat four-by-three flag--to tear it from the breast of a dead rebel--for\r\n_the name_ of getting their little \"rag\" back again. The man that\r\nsecured it was very badly wounded, and they let him keep it. I was with\r\nhim a good deal; he wanted to give me some keepsake, he said,--he didn't\r\nexpect to live,--so he gave me that flag. The best of it all is, dear\r\nM., there isn't a regiment, cavalry or infantry, that wouldn't do the\r\nlike, on the like occasion.\r\n\r\n_April 12_.--I will finish my letter this morning; it is a beautiful\r\nday. I was up in Congress very late last night. The House had a very\r\nexcited night session about expelling the men that proposed recognizing\r\nthe Southern Confederacy. You ought to hear (as I do) the soldiers talk;\r\nthey are excited to madness. We shall probably have hot times here, not\r\nin the military fields alone. The body of the army is true and firm as\r\nthe North Star.\r\n\r\n_May 6, '64_.--M., the poor soldier with diarrhoea, is still living,\r\nbut, oh, what a looking object! Death would be a relief to him--he\r\ncannot last many hours. Cunningham, the Ohio soldier, with leg amputated\r\nat thigh, has pick'd up beyond expectation; now looks indeed like\r\ngetting well. (He died a few weeks afterwards.) The hospitals are very\r\nfull. I am very well indeed. Hot here to-day.\r\n\r\n_May 23, '64_.--Sometimes I think that should it come when it _must_,\r\nto fall in battle, one's anguish over a son or brother kill'd might be\r\ntemper'd with much to take the edge off. Lingering and extreme suffering\r\nfrom wounds or sickness seem to me far worse than death in battle. I\r\ncan honestly say the latter has no terrors for me, as far as I myself am\r\nconcern'd. Then I should say, too, about death in war, that our feelings\r\nand imaginations make a thousand times too much of the whole matter. Of\r\nthe many I have seen die, or known of, the past year, I have not seen or\r\nknown one who met death with terror. In most cases I should say it was\r\na welcome relief and release. Yesterday I spent a good part of the\r\nafternoon with a young soldier of seventeen, Charles Cutter, of Lawrence\r\ncity, Massachusetts, 1st Massachusetts Heavy Artillery, Battery M. He\r\nwas brought to one of the hospitals mortally wounded in abdomen. Well,\r\nI thought to myself, as I sat looking at him, it ought to be a relief to\r\nhis folks if they could see how little he really suffer'd. He lay very\r\nplacid, in a half lethargy, with his eyes closed. As it was extremely\r\nhot, and I sat a good while silently fanning him, and wiping the\r\nsweat, at length he open'd his eyes quite wide and clear, and look'd\r\ninquiringly around. I said, \"What is it, my boy? Do you want anything?\"\r\nHe answer'd quietly, with a good-natured smile, \"Oh, nothing; I was only\r\nlooking around to see who was with me.\" His mind was somewhat wandering,\r\nyet he lay in an evident peacefulness that sanity and health might\r\nhave envied. I had to leave for other engagements. He died, I heard\r\nafterward, without any special agitation, in the course of the night.\r\n\r\n_Washington, May 26, '63_.--M., I think something of commencing a series\r\nof lectures, readings, talks, &c., through the cities of the North, to\r\nsupply myself with funds for hospital ministrations. I do not like to\r\nbe so beholden to others; I need a pretty free supply of money, and the\r\nwork grows upon me, and fascinates me. It is the most magnetic as well\r\nas terrible sight: the lots of poor wounded and helpless men depending\r\nso much, in one ward or another, upon my soothing or talking to them,\r\nor rousing them up a little, or perhaps petting, or feeding them their\r\ndinner or supper (here is a patient, for instance, wounded in both\r\narms,) or giving some trifle for a novelty or change--anything, however\r\ntrivial, to break the monotony of those hospital hours.\r\n\r\nIt is curious: when I am present at the most appalling scenes, deaths,\r\noperations, sickening wounds (perhaps full of maggots,) I keep cool and\r\ndo not give out or budge, although my sympathies are very much excited;\r\nbut often, hours afterward, perhaps when I am home, or out walking\r\nalone, I feel sick, and actually tremble, when I recall the case again\r\nbefore me.\r\n\r\n_Sunday afternoon, opening of 1865_.--Pass'd this afternoon among a\r\ncollection of unusually bad cases, wounded and sick secession soldiers,\r\nleft upon our hands. I spent the previous Sunday afternoon there also.\r\nAt that time two were dying. Two others have died during the week.\r\nSeveral of them are partly deranged. I went around among them\r\nelaborately. Poor boys, they all needed to be cheer'd up. As I sat down\r\nby any particular one, the eyes of all the rest in the neighboring cots\r\nwould fix upon me, and remain steadily riveted as long as I sat within\r\ntheir sight. Nobody seem'd to wish anything special to eat or drink.\r\nThe main thing ask'd for was postage stamps, and paper for writing. I\r\ndistributed all the stamps I had. Tobacco was wanted by some.\r\n\r\nOne call'd me over to him and ask'd me in a low tone what denomination\r\nI belong'd to. He said he was a Catholic--wish'd to find some one of the\r\nsame faith--wanted some good reading. I gave him something to read, and\r\nsat down by him a few minutes. Moved around with a word for each. They\r\nwere hardly any of them personally attractive cases, and no visitors\r\ncome here. Of course they were all destitute of money. I gave small sums\r\nto two or three, apparently the most needy. The men are from quite all\r\nthe Southern States, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, &c.\r\n\r\nWrote several letters. One for a young fellow named Thomas J. Byrd, with\r\na bad wound and diarrhoea. Was from Russell county, Alabama; been out\r\nfour years. Wrote to his mother; had neither heard from her nor written\r\nto her in nine months. Was taken prisoner last Christmas, in Tennessee;\r\nsent to Nashville, then to Camp Chase, Ohio, and kept there a long time;\r\nall the while not money enough to get paper and postage stamps. Was\r\nparoled, but on his way home the wound took gangrene; had diarrhoea\r\nalso; had evidently been very low. Demeanor cool, and patient. A\r\ndark-skinn'd, quaint young fellow, with strong Southern idiom; no\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nAnother letter for John W. Morgan, aged 18, from Shellot, Brunswick\r\ncounty, North Carolina; been out nine months; gunshot wound in right\r\nleg, above knee; also diarrhoea; wound getting along well; quite a\r\ngentle, affectionate boy; wish'd me to put in the letter for his mother\r\nto kiss his little brother and sister for him. [I put strong envelopes\r\non these, and two or three other letters, directed them plainly and\r\nfully, and dropt them in the Washington post-office the next morning\r\nmyself.]\r\n\r\nThe large ward I am in is used for secession soldiers exclusively. One\r\nman, about forty years of age, emaciated with diarrhoea, I was attracted\r\nto, as he lay with his eyes turn'd up, looking like death. His weakness\r\nwas so extreme that it took a minute or so, every time, for him to talk\r\nwith anything like consecutive meaning; yet he was evidently a man of\r\ngood intelligence and education. As I said anything, he would lie a\r\nmoment perfectly still, then, with closed eyes, answer in a low, very\r\nslow voice, quite correct and sensible, but in a way and tone that wrung\r\nmy heart. He had a mother, wife, and child living (or probably living)\r\nin his home in Mississippi. It was long, long since he had seen them.\r\nHad he caus'd a letter to be sent them since he got here in Washington?\r\nNo answer. I repeated the question, very slowly and soothingly. He could\r\nnot tell whether he had or not--things of late seem'd to him like a\r\ndream. After waiting a moment, I said: \"Well, I am going to walk down\r\nthe ward a moment, and when I come back you can tell me. If you have not\r\nwritten, I will sit down and write.\" A few minutes after I return'd; he\r\nsaid he remember'd now that some one had written for him two or three\r\ndays before. The presence of this man impress'd me profoundly. The\r\nflesh was all sunken on face and arms; the eyes low in their sockets\r\nand glassy, and with purple rings around them. Two or three great tears\r\nsilently flow'd out from the eyes, and roll'd down his temples (he was\r\ndoubtless unused to be spoken to as I was speaking to him.)Sickness,\r\nimprisonment, exhaustion, &c., had conquer'd the body, yet the mind held\r\nmastery still, and call'd even wandering remembrance back.\r\n\r\nThere are some fifty Southern soldiers here; all sad, sad cases. There\r\nis a good deal of scurvy. I distributed some paper, envelopes, and\r\npostage stamps, and wrote addresses full and plain on many of the\r\nenvelopes.\r\n\r\nI return'd again Tuesday, August 1, and moved around in the same manner\r\na couple of hours.\r\n\r\n_September 22, '65_.--Afternoon and evening at Douglas hospital to see\r\na friend belonging to 2d New York Artillery (Hiram W. Frazee, Serg't,)\r\ndown with an obstinate compound fracture of left leg receiv'd in one of\r\nthe last battles near Petersburg. After sitting a while with him,\r\nwent through several neighboring wards. In one of them found an old\r\nacquaintance transferr'd here lately, a rebel prisoner, in a dying\r\ncondition. Poor fellow, the look was already on his face. He gazed long\r\nat me. I ask'd him if he knew me. After a moment he utter'd something,\r\nbut inarticulately. I have seen him off and on for the last five months.\r\nHe has suffer'd very much; a bad wound in left leg, severely fractured,\r\nseveral operations, cuttings, extractions of bone, splinters, &c. I\r\nremember he seem'd to me, as I used to talk with him, a fair specimen of\r\nthe main strata of the Southerners, those without property or education,\r\nbut still with the stamp which comes from freedom and equality. I liked\r\nhim; Jonathan Wallace, of Hurd co., Georgia, age 30 (wife, Susan F.\r\nWallace, Houston, Hurd co., Georgia.) [If any good soul of that county\r\nshould see this, I hope he will send her this word.] Had a family; had\r\nnot heard from them since taken prisoner, now six months. I had written\r\nfor him, and done trifles for him, before he came here. He made no\r\noutward show, was mild in his talk and behavior, but I knew he worried\r\nmuch inwardly. But now all would be over very soon. I half sat upon the\r\nlittle stand near the head of the bed. Wallace was somewhat restless.\r\nI placed my hand lightly on his forehead and face, just sliding it over\r\nthe surface. In a moment or so he fell into a calm, regular-breathing\r\nlethargy or sleep, and remain'd so while I sat there. It was dark, and\r\nthe lights were lit. I hardly know why (death seem'd hovering near,) but\r\nI stay'd nearly an hour. A Sister of Charity, dress'd in black, with\r\na broad white linen bandage around her head and under her chin, and a\r\nblack crape over all and flowing down from her head in long wide pieces,\r\ncame to him, and moved around the bed. She bow'd low and solemn to me.\r\nFor some time she moved around there noiseless as a ghost, doing little\r\nthings for the dying man.\r\n\r\n_December, '65_.--The only remaining hospital is now \"Harewood,\" out in\r\nthe woods, northwest of the city. I have been visiting there regularly\r\nevery Sunday during these two months.\r\n\r\n_January 24, '66_.--Went out to Harewood early to-day, and remain'd all\r\nday.\r\n\r\n_Sunday, February 4, 1866_.--Harewood Hospital again. Walk'd out this\r\nafternoon (bright, dry, ground frozen hard) through the woods. Ward 6 is\r\nfill'd with blacks, some with wounds, some ill, two or three with limbs\r\nfrozen. The boys made quite a picture sitting round the stove. Hardly\r\nany can read or write. I write for three or four, direct envelopes, give\r\nsome tobacco, &c.\r\n\r\nJoseph Winder, a likely boy, aged twenty-three, belongs to 10th Color'd\r\nInfantry (now in Texas;) is from Eastville, Virginia. Was a slave;\r\nbelong'd to Lafayette Homeston. The master was quite willing he should\r\nleave. Join'd the army two years ago; has been in one or two battles.\r\nWas sent to hospital with rheumatism. Has since been employ'd as cook.\r\nHis parents at Eastville; he gets letters from them, and has letters\r\nwritten to them by a friend. Many black boys left that part of Virginia\r\nand join'd the army; the 10th, in fact, was made up of Virginia blacks\r\nfrom thereabouts. As soon as discharged is going back to Eastville to\r\nhis parents and home, and intends to stay there.\r\n\r\nThomas King, formerly 2d District Color'd Regiment, discharged soldier,\r\nCompany E, lay in a dying condition; his disease was consumption. A\r\nCatholic priest was administering extreme unction to him. (I have\r\nseen this kind of sight several times in the hospitals; it is very\r\nimpressive.)\r\n\r\n_Harewood, April 29, 1866. Sunday afternoon_.--Poor Joseph Swiers,\r\nCompany H, 155th Pennsylvania, a mere lad (only eighteen years of age;)\r\nhis folks living in Reedsburgh, Pennsylvania. I have known him for\r\nnearly a year, transferr'd from hospital to hospital. He was badly\r\nwounded in the thigh at Hatcher's Run, February 6, '65.\r\n\r\nJames E. Ragan, Atlanta, Georgia; 2d United States Infantry. Union\r\nfolks. Brother impress'd, deserted, died; now no folks, left alone\r\nin the world, is in a singularly nervous state; came in hospital with\r\nintermittent fever.\r\n\r\nWalk slowly around the ward, observing, and to see if I can do anything.\r\nTwo or three are lying very low with consumption, cannot recover; some\r\nwith old wounds; one with both feet frozen off, so that on one only the\r\nheel remains. The supper is being given out: the liquid call'd tea, a\r\nthick slice of bread, and some stew'd apples.\r\n\r\nThat was about the last I saw of the regular army hospitals.\r\n\r\n[ILLUSTRATION Here is a portrait of E.H. from life, by Henry Inman, in\r\nNew York, about 1827 or '28. The painting was finely copper-plated\r\nin 1830, and the present is a fac simile. Looks as I saw him in the\r\nfollowing narrative.]\r\n\r\nThe time was signalized by the _separation_ of the society of Friends,\r\nso greatly talked of--and continuing yet--but so little really\r\nexplain'd. (All I give of this separation is in a Note following.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes (_such as they are) founded on_\r\n\r\nELIAS HICKS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Prefatory Note_--As myself a little boy hearing so much of E.H., at\r\nthat time, long ago, in Suffolk and Queens and Kings counties--and more\r\nthan once personally seeing the old man--and my dear, dear father and\r\nmother faithful listeners to him at the meetings--I remember how I\r\ndream'd to write perhaps a piece about E.H. and his look and discourses,\r\nhowever long afterward--for my parents' sake--and the dear Friends\r\ntoo! And the following is what has at last but all come out of it--the\r\nfeeling and intention never forgotten yet!\r\n\r\nThere is a sort of nature of persons I have compared to little rills of\r\nwater, fresh, from perennial springs--(and the comparison is indeed an\r\nappropriate one)--persons not so very plenty, yet some few certainly\r\nof them running over the surface and area of humanity, all times, all\r\nlands. It is a specimen of this class I would now present. I would sum\r\nup in E.H., and make his case stand for the class, the sort, in all\r\nages, all lands, sparse, not numerous, yet enough to irrigate the\r\nsoil--enough to prove the inherent moral stock and irrepressible\r\ndevotional aspirations growing indigenously of themselves, always\r\nadvancing, and never utterly gone under or lost.\r\n\r\nAlways E.H. gives the service of pointing to the fountain of all naked\r\ntheology, all religion, all worship, all the truth to which you are\r\npossibly eligible--namely in _yourself_ and your inherent relations.\r\nOthers talk of Bibles, saints, churches, exhortations, vicarious\r\natonements--the canons outside of yourself and apart from man--E.H. to\r\nthe religion inside of man's very own nature. This he incessantly labors\r\nto kindle, nourish, educate, bring forward and strengthen. He is the\r\nmost _democratic_ of the religionists--the prophets.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that both the curious fate and death of his four sons,\r\nand the facts (and dwelling on them) of George Fox's strange early life,\r\nand permanent \"conversion,\" had much to do with the peculiar and\r\nsombre ministry and style of E.H. from the first, and confirmed him all\r\nthrough. One must not be dominated by the man's almost absurd saturation\r\nin cut and dried biblical phraseology, and in ways, talk, and standard,\r\nregardful mainly of the one need he dwelt on, above all the rest. This\r\nmain need he drove home to the soul; the canting and sermonizing soon\r\nexhale away to any auditor that realizes what E.H. is for and after. The\r\npresent paper, (a broken memorandum of his formation, his earlier life,)\r\nis the cross-notch that rude wanderers make in the woods, to remind\r\nthem afterward of some matter of first-rate importance and full\r\ninvestigation. (Remember too, that E.H. was _a thorough believer in the\r\nHebrew Scriptures_, in his way.)\r\n\r\nThe following are really but disjointed fragments recall'd to serve and\r\neke out here the lank printed pages of what I commenc'd unwittingly two\r\nmonths ago. Now, as I am well in for it, comes an old attack, the sixth\r\nor seventh recurrence, of my war-paralysis, dulling me from putting the\r\nnotes in shape, and threatening any further action, head or body. _W.W.,\r\nCamden, N.J., July, 1888_.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, my theme is comparatively featureless. The great\r\nhistorian has pass'd by the life of Elias Hicks quite without glance or\r\ntouch. Yet a man might commence and overhaul it as furnishing one of the\r\namplest historic and biography's backgrounds. While the foremost actors\r\nand events from 1750 to 1830 both in Europe and America were crowding\r\neach other on the world's stage--While so many kings, queens, soldiers,\r\nphilosophs, musicians, voyagers, littérateurs, enter one side, cross the\r\nboards, and disappear--amid loudest reverberating names--Frederick\r\nthe Great, Swedenborg, Junius, Voltaire, Rousseau, Linnaeus,\r\nHerschel--curiously contemporary with the long life of Goethe--through\r\nthe occupancy of the British throne by George the Third--amid stupendous\r\nvisible political and social revolutions, and far more stupendous\r\ninvisible moral ones--while the many quarto volumes of the Encyclopaedia\r\nFrançaise are being published at fits and intervals, by Diderot, in\r\nParis--while Haydn and Beethoven and Mozart and Weber are working out\r\ntheir harmonic compositions--while Mrs. Siddons and Talma and Kean are\r\nacting--while Mungo Park explores Africa, and Capt. Cook circumnavigates\r\nthe globe--through all the fortunes of the American Revolution, the\r\nbeginning, continuation and end, the battle of Brooklyn, the surrender\r\nat Saratoga, the final peace of '83--through the lurid tempest of the\r\nFrench Revolution, the execution of the king and queen, and the Reign of\r\nTerror--through the whole of the meteor-career of Napoleon--through\r\nall Washington's, Adams's, Jefferson's, Madison's, and Monroe's\r\nPresidentiads--amid so many flashing lists of names, (indeed there seems\r\nhardly, in any department, any end to them, Old World or New,) Franklin,\r\nSir Joshua Reynolds, Mirabeau, Fox, Nelson, Paul Jones, Kant, Fichte,\r\nand Hegel, Fulton, Walter Scott, Byron, Mesmer, Champollion--Amid\r\npictures that dart upon me even as I speak, and glow and mix and\r\ncoruscate and fade like aurora boreales--Louis the 16th threaten'd by\r\nthe mob, the trial of Warren Hastings, the death-bed of Robert Burns,\r\nWellington at Waterloo, Decatur capturing the Macedonian, or the\r\nsea-fight between the Chesapeake and the Shannon--During all these\r\nwhiles,\r\n\r\nI say, and though on a far different grade, running parallel and\r\ncontemporary with all--a curious, quiet yet busy life centred in a\r\nlittle country village on Long Island, and within sound on still\r\nnights of the mystic surf-beat of the sea. About this life, this\r\nPersonality--neither soldier, nor scientist, nor littérateur--I propose\r\nto occupy a few minutes in fragmentary talk, to give some few melanges,\r\ndisconnected impressions, statistics, resultant groups, pictures,\r\nthoughts' of him, or radiating from him.\r\n\r\nElias Hicks was born March 19, 1748, in Hempstead township, Queens\r\ncounty, Long Island, New York State, near a village bearing the old\r\nScripture name of Jericho, (a mile or so north and east of the present\r\nHicksville, on the L.I. Railroad.) His father and mother were Friends,\r\nof that class working with their own hands, and mark'd by neither riches\r\nnor actual poverty. Elias as a child and youth had small education from\r\nletters, but largely learn'd from Nature's schooling. He grew up even in\r\nhis ladhood a thorough gunner and fisherman. The farm of his parents lay\r\non the south or sea-shore side of Long Island, (they had early removed\r\nfrom Jericho,) one of the best regions in the world for wild fowl and\r\nfor fishing. Elias became a good horseman, too, and knew the animal\r\nwell, riding races; also a singer fond of \"vain songs,\" as he afterwards\r\ncalls them; a dancer, too, at the country balls. When a boy of 13 he had\r\ngone to live with an elder brother; and when about 17 he changed again\r\nand went as apprentice to the carpenter's trade. The time of all this\r\nwas before the Revolutionary War, and the locality 30 to 40 miles from\r\nNew York city. My great-grandfather, Whitman, was often with Elias at\r\nthese periods, and at merry-makings and sleigh-rides in winter over \"the\r\nplains.\"\r\n\r\nHow well I remember the region--the flat plains of the middle of Long\r\nIsland, as then, with their prairie-like vistas and grassy patches in\r\nevery direction, and the 'kill-calf' and herds of cattle and sheep. Then\r\nthe South Bay and shores and the salt meadows, and the sedgy smell, and\r\nnumberless little bayous and hummock-islands in the waters, the habitat\r\nof every sort of fish and aquatic fowl of North America. And the bay\r\nmen--a strong, wild, peculiar race--now extinct, or rather entirely\r\nchanged. And the beach outside the sandy bars, sometimes many miles at\r\na stretch, with their old history of wrecks and storms--the weird,\r\nwhite-gray beach--not without its tales of pathos--tales, too,\r\nof grandest heroes and heroisms. In such scenes and elements and\r\ninfluences--in the midst of Nature and along the shores of the\r\nsea--Elias Hicks was fashion'd through boyhood and early manhood, to\r\nmaturity. But a moral and mental and emotional change was imminent.\r\nAlong at this time he says:\r\n\r\n  My apprenticeship being now expir'd, I gradually withdrew from\r\n  the company of my former associates, became more acquainted with\r\n  Friends, and was more frequent in my attendance of meetings; and\r\n  although this was in some degree profitable to me, yet I made but\r\n  slow progress in my religious improvement. The occupation of part of\r\n  my time in fishing and fowling had frequently tended to preser\r\n  me from falling into hurtful associations; but through the rising\r\n  intimations and reproofs of divine grace in my heart, I now began to\r\n  feel that the manner in which I sometimes amus'd myself with my gun\r\n  was not without sin; for although I mostly preferr'd going alone,\r\n  and while waiting in stillness for the coming of the fowl,\r\n  mind was at times so taken up in divine meditations, that the\r\n  opportunities were seasons of instruction and comfort to me; yet, on\r\n  other occasions, when accompanied by some of my acquaintances, and\r\n  when no fowls appear'd which would be useful to us after being\r\n  obtain'd, we sometimes, from wantonness or for mere diversion, would\r\n  destroy the small birds which could be of no service to us. This\r\n  cruel procedure affects my heart while penning these lines.\r\n\r\nIn his 23d year Elias was married, by the Friends' ceremony, to Jemima\r\nSeaman. His wife was an only child; the parents were well off for common\r\npeople, and at their request the son-in-law mov'd home with them and\r\ncarried on the farm--which at their decease became his own, and he liv'd\r\nthere all his remaining life. Of this matrimonial part of his career,\r\n(it continued, and with unusual happiness, for 58 years,) he says,\r\ngiving the account of his marriage:\r\n\r\n  On this important occasion, we felt the clear and consoling evidence\r\n  of divine truth, and it remain'd with us as a seal upon our spirits,\r\n  strengthening us mutually to bear, with becoming fortitude, the\r\n  vicissitudes and trials which fell to our lot, and of which we h\r\n  a large share in passing through this probationary state. My wife,\r\n  although not of a very strong constitution, liv'd to be the mother\r\n  of eleven children, four sons and seven daughters. Our second\r\n  daughter, a very lovely, promising child, died when young, with the\r\n  small-pox, and the youngest was not living at its birth. The rest\r\n  all arriv'd to years of discretion, and afforded us considerable\r\n  comfort, as they prov'd to be in a good degree dutiful children. All\r\n  our sons, however, were of weak constitutions, and were not able to\r\n  take care of themselves, being so enfeebl'd as not to be able to\r\n  walk after the ninth or tenth year of their age. The two eldest died\r\n  in the fifteenth year of their age, the third in his seventeenth\r\n  year, and the youngest was nearly nineteen when he died. But,\r\n  although thus helpless, the innocency of their lives, and the\r\n  resign'd cheerfulness of their dispositions to their allotments,\r\n  made the labor and toil of taking care of them agreeable and\r\n  pleasant; and I trust we were preserv'd from murmuring or repining,\r\n  believing the dispensation to be in wisdom, and according to the\r\n  will and gracious disposing of an all-wise providence, for purposes\r\n  best known to himself. And when I have observ'd the great anxiety\r\n  and affliction which many parents have with undutiful children who\r\n  are favor'd with health, especially their sons, I could perceive\r\n  very few whose troubles and exercises, on that account, did not far\r\n  exceed ours. The weakness and bodily infirmity of our sons tended to\r\n  keep them much out of the way of the troubles and temptations\r\n  the world; and we believ'd that in their death they were happy, and\r\n  admitted into the realms of peace and joy: a reflection, the most\r\n  comfortable and joyous that parents can have in regard to their\r\n  tender offspring.\r\n\r\nOf a serious and reflective turn, by nature, and from his reading\r\nand surroundings, Elias had more than once markedly devotional inward\r\nintimations. These feelings increas'd in frequency and strength, until\r\nsoon the following:\r\n\r\n  About the twenty-sixth year of my age I was again brought, by the\r\n  operative influence of divine grace, under deep concern of mind; and\r\n  was led, through adorable mercy, to see, that although I had ceas'd\r\n  from many sins and vanities of my youth, yet there were many\r\n  remaining that I was still guilty of, which were not yet aton'd for,\r\n  and for which I now felt the judgments of God to rest upon m\r\n  This caus'd me to cry earnestly to the Most High for pardon and\r\n  redemption, and he graciously condescended to hear my cry, and to\r\n  open a way before me, wherein I must walk, in order to experience\r\n  reconciliation with him; and as I abode in watchfulness and deep\r\n  humiliation before him, light broke forth out of obscurity, and my\r\n  darkness became as the noon-day. I began to have openings leading to\r\n  the ministry, which brought me under close exercise and deep travail\r\n  of spirit; for although I had for some time spoken on subjects of\r\n  business in monthly and preparative meetings, yet the prospe\r\n  of opening my mouth in public meetings was a close trial; but I\r\n  endeavor'd to keep my mind quiet and resign' d to the heavenly call,\r\n  if it should be made clear to me to be my duty. Nevertheless,\r\n  I was, soon after, sitting in a meeting, in much weightiness of\r\n  spirit, a secret, though clear, intimation accompanied me to spe\r\n  a few words, which were then given to me to utter, yet fear so\r\n  prevail'd, that I did not yield to the intimation. For this\r\n  omission, I felt close rebuke, and judgment seem'd, for some time,\r\n  to cover my mind; but as I humbl'd myself under the Lord's mighty\r\n  hand, he again lifted up the light of his countenance upon me, and\r\n  enabl'd me to renew covenant with him, that if he would pass by this\r\n  my offence, I would, in future, be faithful, if he should again\r\n  require such a service of me.\r\n\r\nThe Revolutionary War following, tried the sect of Friends more than\r\nany. The difficulty was to steer between their convictions as patriots,\r\nand their pledges of non-warring peace. Here is the way they solv'd the\r\nproblem:\r\n\r\n  A war, with all its cruel and destructive effects, having raged for\r\n  several years between the British Colonies in North America and the\r\n  mother country, Friends, as well as others, were expos' d to many\r\n  severe trials and sufferings; yet, in the colony of New York,\r\n  Friends, who stood faithful to their principles, and did not meddle\r\n  in the controversy, had, after a short period at first, considerable\r\n  favor allow'd them. The yearly meeting was held steadily, duri\r\n  the war, on Long Island, where the king's party had the rule; yet\r\n  Friends from the Main, where the American army ruled, had free\r\n  passage through both armies to attend it, and any other meetings\r\n  they were desirous of attending, except in a few instances. This was\r\n  a favor which the parties would not grant to their best friends, who\r\n  were of a war-like disposition; which shows what great advantages\r\n  would redound to mankind, were they all of this pacific spirit. I\r\n  pass'd myself through the lines of both armies six times during the\r\n  war, without molestation, both parties generally receiving me with\r\n  openness and civility; and although I had to pass over a tract of\r\n  country, between the two armies, sometimes more than thirty miles in\r\n  extent, and which was much frequented by robbers, a set, in general,\r\n  of cruel, unprincipled banditti, issuing out from both partie\r\n  yet, excepting once, I met with no interruption even from the\r\n  But although Friends in general experienc'd many favors and\r\n  deliverances, yet those scenes of war and confusion occasion\r\n  many trials and provings in various ways to the faithful. One\r\n  circumstance I am willing to mention, as it caus'd me considerable\r\n  exercise and concern. There was a large cellar under the new\r\n  meeting-house belonging to Friends in New York, which was generally\r\n  let as a store. When the king's troops enter'd the city, they took\r\n  possession of it for the purpose of depositing their warlike stores;\r\n  and ascertaining what Friends had the care of letting it, their\r\n  commissary came forward and offer'd to pay the rent; and those\r\n  Friends, for want of due consideration, accepted it. This caus'd\r\n  great uneasiness to the concern'd part of the Society, who\r\n  apprehended it not consistent with our peaceable principles to\r\n  receive payment for the depositing of military stores in our houses.\r\n  The subject was brought before the yearly meeting in 1779, and\r\n  engag'd its careful attention; but those Friends, who had been\r\n  active in the reception of the money, and some few others, were not\r\n  willing to acknowledge their proceedings to be inconsistent, nor to\r\n  return the money to those from whom it was receiv'd; and in order to\r\n  justify themselves therein, they referr'd to the conduct of Friends\r\n  in Philadelphia in similar cases. Matters thus appearing very\r\n  difficult and embarrassing, it was unitedly concluded to refer the\r\n  final determination thereof to the yearly meeting of Pennsylvania;\r\n  and several Friends were appointed to attend that meeting in\r\n  relation thereto, among whom I was one of the number. We accordingly\r\n  set out on the 9th day of the 9th month, 1779, and I was accompanied\r\n  from home by my beloved friend John Willis, who was likewise on the\r\n  appointment. We took a solemn leave of our families, they feeling\r\n  much anxiety at parting with us, on account of the dangers we were\r\n  expos'd to, having to pass not only the lines of the two armies, but\r\n  the deserted and almost uninhabited country that lay between them,\r\n  in many places the grass being grown up in the streets, and many\r\n  houses desolate and empty. Believing it, however, my duty to proceed\r\n  in the service, my mind was so settled and trust-fix'd in the divine\r\n  arm of power, that faith seem'd to banish all fear, and cheerfulness\r\n  and quiet resignation were, I believe, my constant companions during\r\n  the journey. We got permission, with but little difficulty, to pass\r\n  the outguards of the king's army at Kingsbridge, and proceeded to\r\n  Westchester. We afterwards attended meetings at Harrison's Purchase,\r\n  and Oblong, having the concurrence of our monthly meeting to take\r\n  some meetings in our way, a concern leading thereto having for some\r\n  time previously attended my mind. We pass'd from thence to Nine\r\n  Partners, and attended their monthly meeting, and then turn'd our\r\n  faces towards Philadelphia, being join'd by several others of the\r\n  Committee. We attended New Marlborough, Hardwick, and Kingswood\r\n  meetings on our journey, and arriv'd at Philadelphia on the 7th day\r\n  of the week, and 25th of 9th month, on which day we attended the\r\n  yearly meeting of Ministers and Elders, which began at the eleventh\r\n  hour. I also attended all the sittings of the yearly meeting until\r\n  the 4th day of the next week, and was then so indispos'd with a\r\n  fever, which had been increasing on me for several days, that I was\r\n  not able to attend after that time. I was therefore not present when\r\n  the subject was discuss' d, which came from our yearly meeting but I\r\n  was inform'd by my companion, that it was a very solemn opportunity,\r\n  and the matter was resulted in advising that the money should be\r\n  return'd into the office from whence it was receiv'd, accompanied\r\n  with our reasons for so doing: and this was accordingly done by the\r\n  direction of our yearly meeting the next year.\r\n\r\nThen, season after season, when peace and Independence reign'd, year\r\nfollowing year, this remains to be (1791) a specimen of his personal\r\nlabors:\r\n\r\n  I was from home on this journey four months and eleven days; rode\r\n  about one thousand five hundred miles, and attended forty-nine\r\n  particular meetings among Friends, three quarterly meetings, six\r\n  monthly meetings, and forty meetings among other people.\r\n\r\nAnd again another experience:\r\n\r\n  In the forepart of this meeting, my mind was reduc'd into such a\r\n  state of great weakness and depression, that my faith was almost\r\n  ready to fail, which produc'd great searchings of heart, so that I\r\n  was led to call in question all that I had ever before experienc'd.\r\n  In this state of doubting, I was ready to wish myself at home, from\r\n  an apprehension that I should only expose myself to reproach, and\r\n  wound the cause I was embark'd in; for the heavens seem'd like\r\n  brass, and the earth as iron; such coldness and hardness, I thought,\r\n  could scarcely have ever been experienc'd before by any creature, so\r\n  great was the depth of my baptism at this time; nevertheless, as I\r\n  endeavor'd to quiet my mind, in this conflicting dispensation, and\r\n  be resign'd to my allotment, however distressing, towards the latter\r\n  part of the meeting a ray of light broke through the surrounding\r\n  darkness, in which the Shepherd of Israel was pleas'd to arise, and\r\n  by the light of his glorious countenance, to scatter those clouds of\r\n  opposition. Then ability was receiv'd, and utterance given, to speak\r\n  of his marvellous works in the redemption of souls, and to op\r\n  the way of life and salvation, and the mysteries of his glorious\r\n  kingdom, which are hid from the wise and prudent of this world, and\r\n  reveal'd only unto those who are reduc'd into the state of little\r\n  children and babes in Christ.\r\n\r\nAnd concluding another jaunt in 1794:\r\n\r\n  I was from home in this journey about five months, and travell\r\n  by land and water about two thousand two hundred and eighty-three\r\n  miles; having visited all the meetings of Friends in the New England\r\n  states, and many meetings amongst those of other professions; and\r\n  also visited many meetings, among Friends and others, in the upper\r\n  part of our own yearly meeting; and found real peace in my labors.\r\n\r\nAnother 'tramp' in 1798:\r\n\r\n  I was absent from home in this journey about five months and two\r\n  weeks, and rode about sixteen hundred miles, and attended about one\r\n  hundred and forty-three meetings.\r\n\r\nHere are some memoranda of 1813, near home:\r\n\r\n  First day. Our meeting this day pass'd in silent labor. The cloud\r\n  rested on the tabernacle; and, although it was a day of much rain\r\n  outwardly, yet very little of the dew of Hermon appear'd to distil\r\n  among us. Nevertheless, a comfortable calm was witness'd towards the\r\n  close, which we must render to the account of unmerited mercy and\r\n  love.\r\n\r\n  Second day. Most of this day was occupied in a visit to a sick\r\n  friend, who appeared comforted therewith. Spent part of the evening\r\n  in reading part of Paul's Epistle to the Romans.\r\n\r\n  Third day. I was busied most of this day in my common vocations.\r\n  Spent the evening principally in reading Paul. Found considerable\r\n  satisfaction in his first epistle to the Corinthians; in which he\r\n  shows the danger of some in setting too high a value on those who\r\n  were instrumental in bringing them to the knowledge of the truth,\r\n  without looking through and beyond the instrument, to the great\r\n  first cause and Author of every blessing, to whom all the praise and\r\n  honor are due.\r\n\r\n  Fifth day, 1st of 4th month. At our meeting to-day found it, as\r\n  usual, a very close steady exercise to keep the mind center'\r\n  where it ought to be. What a multitude of intruding thoughts\r\n  imperceptibly, as it were, steal into the mind, and turn it from its\r\n  proper object, whenever it relaxes its vigilance in watching against\r\n  them. Felt a little strength, just at the close, to remind Friends\r\n  of the necessity of a steady perseverance, by a recapitulation of\r\n  the parable of the unjust judge, showing how men ought always to\r\n  pray, and not to faint.\r\n\r\n  Sixth day. Nothing material occurr'd, but a fear lest the cares of\r\n  the world should engross too much of my time.\r\n\r\n  Seventh day. Had an agreeable visit from two ancient friends, which\r\n  I have long lov'd. The rest of the day I employ'd in manual labor,\r\n  mostly in gardening.\r\n\r\nBut we find if we attend to records and details, we shall lay out an\r\nendless task. We can briefly say, summarily, that his whole life was\r\na long religious missionary life of method, practicality, sincerity,\r\nearnestness, and pure piety--as near to his time here, as one in Judea,\r\nfar back--or in any life, any age. The reader who feels interested must\r\nget--with all its dryness and mere dates, absence of emotionality\r\nor literary quality, and whatever abstract attraction (with even a\r\nsuspicion of cant, sniffling,) the \"Journal of the Life and Religious\r\nLabours of Elias Hicks, written by himself,\" at some Quaker book-store.\r\n(It is from this headquarters I have extracted the preceding\r\nquotations.) During E. H.'s matured life, continued from fifty to sixty\r\nyears--while working steadily, earning his living and paying his way\r\nwithout intermission--he makes, as previously memorandized, several\r\nhundred preaching visits, not only through Long Island, but some of them\r\naway into the Middle or Southern States, or north into Canada, or the\r\nthen far West--extending to thousands of miles, or filling several weeks\r\nand sometimes months. These religious journeys--scrupulously accepting\r\nin payment only his transportation from place to place, with his own\r\nfood and shelter, and never receiving a dollar of money for \"salary\"\r\nor preaching--Elias, through good bodily health and strength, continues\r\ntill quite the age of eighty. It was thus at one of his latest jaunts in\r\nBrooklyn city I saw and heard him. This sight and hearing shall now be\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nElias Hicks was at this period in the latter part (November or December)\r\nof 1829. It was the last tour of the many missions of the old man's\r\nlife. He was in the 81st year of his age, and a few months before he\r\nhad lost by death a beloved wife with whom he had lived in unalloyed\r\naffection and esteem for 58 years. (But a few months after this meeting\r\nElias was paralyzed and died.) Though it is sixty years ago since--and I\r\na little boy at the time in Brooklyn, New York--I can remember my father\r\ncoming home toward sunset from his day's work as carpenter, and saying\r\nbriefly, as he throws down his armful of kindling-blocks with a bounce\r\non the kitchen floor, \"Come, mother, Elias preaches to-night.\" Then my\r\nmother, hastening the supper and the table-cleaning afterward, gets a\r\nneighboring young woman, a friend of the family, to step in and keep\r\nhouse for an hour or so--puts the two little ones to bed--and as I had\r\nbeen behaving well that day, as a special reward I was allow'd to go\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nWe start for the meeting. Though, as I said, the stretch of more than\r\nhalf a century has pass'd over me since then, with its war and peace,\r\nand all its joys and sins and deaths (and what a half century! how it\r\ncomes up sometimes for an instant, like the lightning flash in a storm\r\nat night!) I can recall that meeting yet. It is a strange place\r\nfor religious devotions. Elias preaches anywhere--no respect to\r\nbuildings--private or public houses, school-rooms, barns, even\r\ntheatres--anything that will accommodate. This time it is in a handsome\r\nball-room, on Brooklyn Heights, overlooking New York, and in full sight\r\nof that great city, and its North and East rivers fill'd with ships--is\r\n(to specify more particularly) the second story of \"Morrison's Hotel,\"\r\nused for the most genteel concerts, balls, and assemblies--a large,\r\ncheerful, gay-color'd room, with glass chandeliers bearing myriads of\r\nsparkling pendants, plenty of settees and chairs, and a sort of velvet\r\ndivan running all round the side-walls. Before long the divan and all\r\nthe settees and chairs are fill'd; many fashionables out of curiosity;\r\nall the principal dignitaries of the town, Gen. Jeremiah Johnson, Judge\r\nFurman, George Hall, Mr. Willoughby, Mr. Pierrepont, N.B. Morse, Cyrus\r\nP. Smith, and F.C. Tucker. Many young folks too; some richly dress'd\r\nwomen; I remember I noticed with one party of ladies a group of\r\nuniform'd officers, either from the U.S. Navy Yard, or some ship in the\r\nstream, or some adjacent fort. On a slightly elevated platform at the\r\nhead of the room, facing the audience, sit a dozen or more Friends, most\r\nof them elderly, grim, and with their broad-brimm'd hats on their heads.\r\nThree or four women, too, in their characteristic Quaker costumes and\r\nbonnets. All still as the grave.\r\n\r\nAt length after a pause and stillness becoming almost painful, Elias\r\nrises and stands for a moment or two without a word. A tall, straight\r\nfigure, neither stout nor very thin, dress'd in drab cloth, clean-shaved\r\nface, forehead of great expanse, and large and clear black eyes,[42]\r\nlong or middling-long white hair; he was at this time between 80 and 81\r\nyears of age, his head still wearing the broad-brim. A moment looking\r\naround the audience with those piercing eyes, amid the perfect\r\nstillness. (I can almost see him and the whole scene now.) Then the\r\nwords come from his lips, very emphatically and slowly pronounc'd, in a\r\nresonant, grave, melodious voice, _What is the chief end of man? I was\r\ntold in my early youth, it was to glorify God, and seek and enjoy him\r\nforever._\r\n\r\nI cannot follow the discourse. It presently becomes very fervid, and in\r\nthe midst of its fervor he takes the broad-brim hat from his head, and\r\nalmost dashing it down with violence on the seat behind, continues with\r\nuninterrupted earnestness. But, I say, I cannot repeat, hardly suggest\r\nhis sermon. Though the differences and disputes of the formal division\r\nof the Society of Friends were even then under way, he did not allude\r\nto them at all. A pleading, tender, nearly agonizing conviction,\r\nand magnetic stream of natural eloquence, before which all minds and\r\nnatures, all emotions, high or low, gentle or simple, yielded entirely\r\nwithout exception, was its cause, method, and effect. Many, very many\r\nwere in tears. Years afterward in Boston, I heard Father Taylor, the\r\nsailor's preacher, and found in his passionate unstudied oratory the\r\nresemblance to Elias Hicks's--not argumentative or intellectual, but so\r\npenetrating--so different from anything in the books--(different as the\r\nfresh air of a May morning or sea-shore breeze from the atmosphere of a\r\nperfumer's shop.)\r\n\r\nWhile he goes on he falls into the nasality and sing-song tone sometimes\r\nheard in such meetings; but in a moment or two more as if recollecting\r\nhimself, he breaks off, stops, and resumes in a natural tone. This\r\noccurs three or four times during the talk of the evening, till all\r\nconcludes.\r\n\r\nNow and then, at the many scores and hundreds--even thousands--of his\r\ndiscourses--as at this one--he was very mystical and radical,[43] and\r\nhad much to say of \"the light within.\" Very likely this same inner\r\nlight, (so dwelt upon by newer men, as by Fox and Barclay at the\r\nbeginning, and all Friends and deep thinkers since and now,) is perhaps\r\nonly another name for the religious conscience. In my opinion they have\r\nall diagnos'd, like superior doctors, the real in-most disease of our\r\ntimes, probably any times. Amid the huge inflammation call'd society,\r\nand that other inflammation call'd politics, what is there to-day of\r\nmoral power and ethic sanity as antiseptic to them and all? Though I\r\nthink the essential elements of the moral nature exist latent in the\r\ngood average people of the United States of to-day, and sometimes break\r\nout strongly, it is certain that any mark'd or dominating National\r\nMorality (if I may use the phrase) has not only not yet been develop'd,\r\nbut that--at any rate when the point of view is turn'd on business,\r\npolitics, competition, practical life, and in character and manners in\r\nour New World--there seems to be a hideous depletion, almost absence, of\r\nsuch moral nature. Elias taught throughout, as George Fox began it, or\r\nrather reiterated and verified it, the Platonic doctrine that the ideals\r\nof character, of justice, of religious action, whenever the highest is\r\nat stake, are to be conform'd to no outside doctrine of creeds, Bibles,\r\nlegislative enactments, conventionalities, or even decorums, but are to\r\nfollow the inward Deity-planted law of the emotional soul. In this only\r\nthe true Quaker, or Friend, has faith; and it is from rigidly, perhaps\r\nstrainingly carrying it out, that both the Old and New England records\r\nof Quakerdom show some unseemly and insane acts.\r\n\r\nIn one of the lives of Ralph Waldo Emerson is a list of lessons or\r\ninstructions, (\"seal'd orders\" the biographer calls them,) prepar'd by\r\nthe sage himself for his own guidance. Here is one:\r\n\r\n    Go forth with thy message among thy fellow-creatures; teach them that\r\n    they must trust themselves as guided by that inner light which dwells\r\n    with the pure in heart, to whom it was promis'd of old that they shall\r\n    see God.\r\n\r\nHow thoroughly it fits the life and theory of Elias Hicks. Then in Omar\r\nKhayyam:\r\n\r\n    I sent my soul through the Invisible,\r\n      Some letter of that after-life to spell,\r\n    And by-and-by my soul return'd to me,\r\n      And answer'd, \"I myself am Heaven and Hell.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, of this important element of the theory and practice of\r\nQuakerism, the difficult-to-describe \"Light within\" or \"Inward Law, by\r\nwhich all must be either justified or condemn'd,\" I will not undertake\r\nwhere so many have fail'd--the task of making the statement of it for\r\nthe average comprehension. We will give, partly for the matter and\r\npartly as specimen of his speaking and writing style, what Elias Hicks\r\nhimself says in allusion to it--one or two of very many passages. Most\r\nof his discourses, like those of Epictetus and the ancient peripatetics,\r\nhave left no record remaining--they were extempore, and those were not\r\nthe times of reporters. Of one, however, deliver'd in Chester, Pa.,\r\ntoward the latter part of his career, there is a careful transcript; and\r\nfrom it (even if presenting you a sheaf of hidden wheat that may need to\r\nbe pick'd and thrash'd out several times before you get the grain,) we\r\ngive the following extract:\r\n\r\n  I don't want to express a great many words; but I want you to be\r\n  call'd home to the substance. For the Scriptures, and all the\r\n  books in the world, can do no more; Jesus could do no more than to\r\n  recommend to this Comforter, which was the light in him. \"God is\r\n  light, and in him is no darkness at all; and if we walk in the\r\n  light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another.\"\r\n  Because the light is one in all, and therefore it binds us together\r\n  in the bonds of love; for it is not only light, but love--that love\r\n  which casts out all fear. So that they who dwell in God dwell in\r\n  love, and they are constrain'd to walk in it; and if they \"walk in\r\n  it, they have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus\r\n  Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.\"\r\n\r\n  But what blood, my friends? Did Jesus Christ, the Saviour, ever have\r\n  any material blood? Not a drop of it, my friends--not a drop of it.\r\n  That blood which cleanseth from the life of all sin, was the life of\r\n  the soul of Jesus. The soul of man has no material blood; but as the\r\n  outward material blood, created from the dust of the earth, is the\r\n  life of these bodies of flesh, so with respect to the soul, the\r\n  immortal and invisible spirit, its blood is that life which God\r\n  breath'd into it.\r\n\r\n  As we read, in the beginning, that \"God form'd man of the dust of\r\n  the ground, and breath'd into him the breath of life, and man became\r\n  a living soul.\" He breath'd into that soul, and it became alive to\r\n  God.\r\n\r\nThen, from one of his many letters, for he seems to have delighted in\r\ncorrespondence:\r\n\r\n  Some may query, What is the cross of Christ? To these I answer, It\r\n  is the perfect law of God, written on the tablet of the hear\r\n  and in the heart of every rational creature, in such indelible\r\n  characters that all the power of mortals cannot erase nor obliterate\r\n  it. Neither is there any power or means given or dispens'd to the\r\n  children of men, but this inward law and light, by which the true\r\n  and saving knowledge of God can be obtain' d. And by this inward law\r\n  and light, all will be either justified or condemn'd, and all made\r\n  to know God for themselves, and be left without excuse, agreeably to\r\n  the prophecy of Jeremiah, and the corroborating testimony of Jesus\r\n  in his last counsel and command to his disciples, not to depart from\r\n  Jerusalem till they should receive power from on high; assuring them\r\n  that they should receive power, when they had receiv'd the pouring\r\n  forth of the spirit upon them, which would qualify them to bear\r\n  witness of him in Judea, Jerusalem, Samaria, and to the uttermost\r\n  parts of the earth; which was verified in a marvellous manner on the\r\n  day of Pentecost, when thousands were converted to the Christian\r\n  faith in one day.\r\n\r\n  By which it is evident that nothing but this inward light and law,\r\n  as it is heeded and obey'd, ever did, or ever can, make a true\r\n  and real Christian and child of God. And until the professors\r\n  of Christianity agree to lay aside all their non-essentials in\r\n  religion, and rally to this unchangeable foundation and standard of\r\n  truth, wars and fightings, confusion and error, will prevail, and\r\n  the angelic song cannot be heard in our land--that of \"glory to God\r\n  in the highest, and on earth peace and good will to men.\"\r\n\r\n  But when all nations are made willing to make this inward law and\r\n  light the rule and standard of all their faith and works, then we\r\n  shall be brought to know and believe alike, that there is but one\r\n  Lord, one faith, and but one baptism; one God and Father, that is\r\n  above all, through all, and in all.\r\n\r\n  And then will all those glorious and consoling prophecies recorded\r\n  in the scriptures of truth be fulfill'd--\"He,\" the Lord, \"shall\r\n  judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people; and they\r\n  shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into\r\n  pruning-hooks; nation shall not lift up the sword against nation,\r\n  neither shall they learn war any more. The wolf also shall dwell\r\n  with the lamb; and the cow and the bear shall feed; and the lion\r\n  shall eat straw like the ox; and the sucking child shall play\r\n  the hole of the asp, and the wean'd child put his hand on the\r\n  cockatrice's den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy\r\n  mountain; for the earth,\" that is our earthly tabernacle, \"shall be\r\n  full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.\"\r\n\r\nThe exposition in the last sentence, that the terms of the texts are not\r\nto be taken in their literal meaning, but in their spiritual one, and\r\nallude to a certain wondrous exaltation of the body, through religious\r\ninfluences, is significant, and is but one of a great number of\r\ninstances of much that is obscure, to \"the world's people,\" in the\r\npreachings of this remarkable man.\r\n\r\nThen a word about his physical oratory, connected with the preceding. If\r\nthere is, as doubtless there is, an unnameable something behind oratory,\r\na fund within or atmosphere without, deeper than art, deeper even than\r\nproof, that unnameable constitutional something Elias Hicks emanated\r\nfrom his very heart to the hearts of his audience, or carried with\r\nhim, or probed into, and shook and arous'd in them--a sympathetic germ,\r\nprobably rapport, lurking in every human eligibility, which no book,\r\nno rule, no statement has given or can give inherent knowledge,\r\nintuition--not even the best speech, or best put forth, but launch'd out\r\nonly by powerful human magnetism:\r\n\r\n    Unheard by sharpest ear--unformed in clearest eye, or cunningest\r\n      mind,\r\n    Nor lore, nor fame, nor happiness, nor wealth,\r\n    And yet the pulse of every heart and life throughout the world,\r\n      incessantly,\r\n    Which you and I, and all, pursuing ever, ever miss;\r\n    Open, but still a secret--the real of the real--an illusion;\r\n    Costless, vouchsafed to each, yet never man the owner;\r\n    Which poets vainly seek to put in rhyme----historians in prose;\r\n    Which sculptor never chisel'd yet, nor painter painted;\r\n    Which vocalist never sung, nor orator nor actor ever utter' d.\r\n\r\nThat remorse, too, for a mere worldly life--that aspiration towards the\r\nideal, which, however overlaid, lies folded latent, hidden, in perhaps\r\nevery character. More definitely, as near as I remember (aided by\r\nmy dear mother long afterward,) Elias Hicks's discourse there in the\r\nBrooklyn ball-room, was one of his old never-remitted appeals to that\r\nmoral mystical portion of human nature, the inner light. But it is\r\nmainly for the scene itself, and Elias's personnel, that I recall the\r\nincident.\r\n\r\nSoon afterward the old man died:\r\n\r\n  On first day morning, the 14th of 2d month (February, 1830,) he was\r\n  engaged in his room, writing to a friend, until a little after ten\r\n  o'clock, when he return'd to that occupied by the family, apparently\r\n  just attack'd by a paralytic affection, which nearly deprived h\r\n  of the use of his right side, and of the power of speech. Being\r\n  assisted to a chair near the fire, he manifested by signs, that the\r\n  letter which he had just finish'd, and which had been dropp'd\r\n  the way, should be taken care of; and on its being brought to him,\r\n  appear'd satisfied, and manifested a desire that all should sit down\r\n  and be still, seemingly sensible that his labours were brought to a\r\n  close, and only desirous of quietly waiting the final change. The\r\n  solemn composure at this time manifest in his countenance, w\r\n  very impressive, indicating that he was sensible the time of his\r\n  departure was at hand, and that the prospect of death brought no\r\n  terrors with it. During his last illness, his mental faculti\r\n  were occasionally obscured, yet he was at times enabled to give\r\n  satisfactory evidence to those around him, that all was well, and\r\n  that he felt nothing in his way.\r\n\r\n  His funeral took place on fourth day, the 3rd of 3rd month. It was\r\n  attended by a large concourse of Friends and others, and a solid\r\n  meeting was held on the occasion; after which, his remains were\r\n  interr'd in Friends' burial-ground at this place (Jericho, Queens\r\n  county, New York.)\r\n\r\nI have thought (even presented so incompletely, with such fearful\r\nhiatuses, and in my own feebleness and waning life) one might well\r\nmemorize this life of Elias Hicks. Though not eminent in literature or\r\npolitics or inventions or business, it is a token of not a few, and is\r\nsignificant. Such men do not cope with statesmen or soldiers--but I have\r\nthought they deserve to be recorded and kept up as a sample--that this\r\none specially does. I have already compared it to a little flowing\r\nliquid rill of Nature's life, maintaining freshness. As if, indeed,\r\nunder the smoke of battles, the blare of trumpets, and the madness of\r\ncontending hosts--the screams of passion, the groans of the suffering,\r\nthe parching of struggles of money and politics, and all hell's heat and\r\nnoise and competition above and around--should come melting down from\r\nthe mountains from sources of unpolluted snows, far up there in God's\r\nhidden, untrodden recesses, and so rippling along among us low in the\r\nground, at men's very feet, a curious little brook of clear and cool,\r\nand ever-healthy, ever-living water.\r\n\r\n_Note.--The Separation_.--The division vulgarly call'd between Orthodox\r\nand Hicksites in the Society of Friends took place in 1827, '8 and '9.\r\nProbably it had been preparing some time. One who was present has since\r\ndescribed to me the climax, at a meeting of Friends in Philadelphia\r\ncrowded by a great attendance of both sexes, with Elias as principal\r\nspeaker. In the course of his utterance or argument he made use of these\r\nwords: \"The blood of Christ--the blood of Christ--why, my friends, the\r\nactual blood of Christ in itself was no more effectual than the blood\r\nof bulls and goats--not a bit more--not a bit.\" At these words, after\r\na momentary hush, commenced a great tumult. Hundreds rose to their\r\nfeet.... Canes were thump'd upon the floor. From all parts of the\r\nhouse angry mutterings. Some left the place, but more remain'd, with\r\nexclamations, flush'd faces and eyes. This was the definite utterance,\r\nthe overt act, which led to the separation. Families diverg'd--even\r\nhusbands and wives, parents and children, were separated.\r\n\r\nOf course what Elias promulg'd spread a great commotion among the\r\nFriends. Sometimes when he presented himself to speak in the meeting,\r\nthere would be opposition--this led to angry words, gestures, unseemly\r\nnoises, recriminations. Elias, at such times, was deeply affected--the\r\ntears roll'd in streams down his cheeks--he silently waited the close of\r\nthe dispute. \"Let the Friend speak; let the Friend speak!\" he would\r\nsay when his supporters in the meeting tried to bluff off some violent\r\northodox person objecting to the new doctrinaire. But he never recanted.\r\n\r\nA reviewer of the old dispute and separation made the following comments\r\non them in a paper ten years ago: \"It was in America, where there had\r\nbeen no persecution worth mentioning since Mary Dyer was hang'd on\r\nBoston Common, that about fifty years ago differences arose, singularly\r\nenough upon doctrinal points of the divinity of Christ and the nature\r\nof the atonement. Whoever would know how bitter was the controversy,\r\nand how much of human infirmity was found to be still lurking under\r\nbroad-brim hats and drab coats, must seek for the information in the\r\nLives of Elias Hicks and of Thomas Shillitoe, the latter an English\r\nFriend, who visited us at this unfortunate time, and who exercised his\r\ngifts as a peace-maker with but little success. The meetings, according\r\nto his testimony, were sometimes turn'd into mobs. The disruption was\r\nwide, and seems to have been final. Six of the ten yearly meetings were\r\ndivided; and since that time various sub-divisions have come, four\r\nor five in number. There has never, however, been anything like a\r\nrepetition of the excitement of the Hicksite controversy; and Friends of\r\nall kinds at present appear to have settled down into a solid, steady,\r\ncomfortable state, and to be working in their own way without troubling\r\nother Friends whose ways are different.\"\r\n\r\n_Note_.--Old persons, who heard this man in his day, and who glean'd\r\nimpressions from what they saw of him, (judg'd from their own points\r\nof views,) have, in their conversation with me, dwelt on another point.\r\nThey think Elias Hicks had a large element of personal ambition, the\r\npride of leadership, of establishing perhaps a sect that should reflect\r\nhis own name, and to which he should give especial form and character.\r\nVery likely. Such indeed seems the means, all through progress and\r\ncivilization, by which strong men and strong convictions achieve\r\nanything definite. But the basic foundation of Elias was undoubtedly\r\ngenuine religious fervor. He was like an old Hebrew prophet. He had the\r\nspirit of one, and in his later years look'd like one. What Carlyle says\r\nof John Knox will apply to him:\r\n\r\n  He is an instance to us how a man, by sincerity itself, becomes\r\n  heroic; it is the grand gift he has. We find in him a good, honest,\r\n  intellectual talent, no transcendent one;--a narrow, inconsiderable\r\n  man, as compared with Luther; but in heartfelt instinctive adherence\r\n  to truth, in _sincerity_ as we say, he has no superior; nay, one\r\n  might ask, What equal he has? The heart of him is of the true\r\n  Prophet cast. \"He lies there,\" said the Earl of Morton at Knox's\r\n  grave, \"who never fear'd the face of man.\" He resembles, more than\r\n  any of the moderns, an old Hebrew Prophet. The same inflexibility,\r\n  intolerance, rigid, narrow-looking adherence to God's truth.\r\n\r\n_A Note yet. The United States to-day_.--While under all previous\r\nconditions (even convictions) of society, Oriental, Feudal,\r\nEcclesiastical, and in all past (or present) Despotisms, through the\r\nentire past, there existed, and exists yet, in ally and fusion with\r\nthem, and frequently forming the main part of them, certain churches,\r\ninstitutes, priesthoods, fervid beliefs, &c., practically promoting\r\nreligious and moral action to the fullest degrees of which humanity\r\nthere under circumstances was capable, and often conserving all there\r\nwas of justice, art, literature, and good manners--it is clear I say,\r\nthat, under the Democratic Institutes of the United States, now and\r\nhenceforth, there are no equally genuine fountains of fervid beliefs,\r\nadapted to produce similar moral and religious results, according to\r\nour circumstances. I consider that the churches, sects, pulpits, of the\r\npresent day, in the United States, exist not by any solid convictions,\r\nbut by a sort of tacit, supercilious, scornful suffrance. Few speak\r\nopenly--none officially--against them. But the ostent continuously\r\nimposing, who is not aware that any such living fountains of belief in\r\nthem are now utterly ceas'd and departed from the minds of men?\r\n\r\n_A Lingering Note_.--In the making of a full man, all the other\r\nconsciences, (the emotional, courageous, intellectual, esthetic, &c.,)\r\nare to be crown'd and effused by the religious conscience. In the higher\r\nstructure of a human self, or of community, the Moral, the Religious,\r\nthe Spiritual, is strictly analogous to the subtle vitalization and\r\nantiseptic play call'd Health in the physiologic structure. To person or\r\nState, the main verteber (or rather _the_ verteber) is Morality.\r\n\r\nThat is indeed the only real vitalization of character, and of all the\r\nsupersensual, even heroic and artistic portions of man or nationality.\r\nIt is to run through and knit the superior parts, and keep man or State\r\nvital and upright, as health keeps the body straight and blooming. Of\r\ncourse a really grand and strong and beautiful character is probably to\r\nbe slowly grown, and adjusted strictly with reference to itself, its own\r\npersonal and social sphere--with (paradox though it may be) the clear\r\nunderstanding that the conventional theories of life, worldly ambition,\r\nwealth, office, fame, &c., are essentially but glittering mayas,\r\ndelusions.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the greatest scientists and theologians will sometimes find\r\nthemselves saying, It isn't only those who know most, who contribute\r\nmost to God's glory. Doubtless these very scientists at times stand with\r\nbared heads before the humblest lives and personalities. For there is\r\nsomething greater (is there not?) than all the science and poems of the\r\nworld--above all else, like the stars shining eternal--above Shakspere's\r\nplays, or Concord philosophy, or art of Angelo or Raphael--something\r\nthat shines elusive, like beams of Hesperus at evening--high above all\r\nthe vaunted wealth and pride--prov'd by its practical outcropping in\r\nlife, each case after its own concomitants--the intuitive blending of\r\ndivine love and faith in a human emotional character--blending for all,\r\nfor the unlearn'd, the common, and the poor.\r\n\r\nI don't know in what book I once read, (possibly the remark has been\r\nmade in books, all ages,) that no life ever lived, even the most\r\nuneventful, but, probed to its centre, would be found in itself as\r\nsubtle a drama as any that poets have ever sung, or playwrights fabled.\r\nOften, too, in size and weight, that life suppos'd obscure. For it isn't\r\nonly the palpable stars; astronomers say there are dark, or almost dark,\r\nunnotic'd orbs and suns, (like the dusky companions of Sirius, seven\r\ntimes as large as our own sun,) rolling through space, real and potent\r\nas any--perhaps the most real and potent. Yet none recks of them. In the\r\nbright lexicon we give the spreading heavens, they have not even names.\r\nAmid ceaseless sophistications all times, the soul would seem to glance\r\nyearningly around for such contrasts--such cool, still offsets.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n[42]In Walter Scott's reminiscences he speaks of Burns as having the\r\nmost eloquent, glowing, flashing, illuminated dark-orbed eyes he ever\r\nbeheld in a human face; and I think Elias Hicks's must have been like\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[43] The true Christian religion, (such was the teaching of Elias\r\nHicks,) consists neither in rites or Bibles or sermons or Sundays--but\r\nin noiseless secret ecstasy and unremitted aspiration, in purity, in a\r\ngood practical life, in charity to the poor and toleration to all. He\r\nsaid, \"A man may keep the Sabbath, may belong to a church and attend all\r\nthe observances, have regular family prayer, keep a well-bound copy of\r\nthe Hebrew Scriptures in a conspicuous place in his house, and yet not\r\nbe a truly religious person at all.\" E. believ'd little in a church\r\nas organiz'd-even his own--with houses, ministers, or with salaries,\r\ncreeds, Sundays, saints, Bibles, holy festivals, &c. But he believ'\r\nd always in the universal church, in the soul of man, invisibly rapt,\r\never-waiting, ever-responding to universal truths.--He was fond of pithy\r\nproverbs. He said, \"It matters not where you live, but how you live.\"\r\nHe said once to my father, \"They talk of the devil--I tell thee, Walter,\r\nthere is no worse devil than man.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE FOX (AND SHAKSPERE)\r\n\r\nWhile we are about it, we must almost Inevitably go back to the origin\r\nof the Society of which Elias Hicks has so far prov'd to be the most\r\nmark'd individual result. We must revert to the latter part of the\r\n16th, and all, or nearly all of that 17th century, crowded with so many\r\nimportant historical events, changes, and personages. Throughout Europe,\r\nand especially in what we call our Mother Country, men were unusually\r\narous'd--(some would say demented.) It was a special age of the insanity\r\nof witch-trials and witch-hangings. In one year 60 were hung for\r\nwitchcraft in one English county alone. It was peculiarly an age\r\nof military-religious conflict. Protestantism and Catholicism were\r\nwrestling like giants for the mastery, straining every nerve. Only to\r\nthink of it--that age! its events, persons--Shakspere just dead, (his\r\nfolios publish'd, complete)--Charles 1st, the shadowy spirit and the\r\nsolid block! To sum up all, it was the age of Cromwell!\r\n\r\nAs indispensable foreground, indeed, for Elias Hicks, and perhaps sine\r\nqua non to an estimate of the kind of man, we must briefly transport\r\nourselves back to the England of that period. As I say, it is the time\r\nof tremendous moral and political agitation; ideas of conflicting forms,\r\ngovernments, theologies, seethe and dash like ocean storms, and ebb and\r\nflow like mighty tides. It was, or had been, the time of the long feud\r\nbetween the Parliament and the Crown. In the midst of the sprouts, began\r\nGeorge Fox--born eight years after the death of Shakspere. He was the\r\nson of a weaver, himself a shoemaker, and was \"converted\" before the age\r\nof 20. But O the sufferings, mental and physical, through which those\r\nyears of the strange youth pass'd! He claim'd to be sent by God to\r\nfulfill a mission. \"I come,\" he said, \"to direct people to the spirit\r\nthat gave forth the Scriptures.\" The range of his thought, even then,\r\ncover'd almost every important subject of after times, anti-slavery,\r\nwomen's rights, &c. Though in a low sphere, and among the masses, he\r\nforms a mark'd feature in the age.\r\n\r\nAnd how, indeed, beyond all any, that stormy and perturb'd age! The\r\nfoundations of the old, the superstitious, the conventionally poetic,\r\nthe credulous, all breaking--the light of the new, and of science and\r\ndemocracy, definitely beginning--a mad, fierce, almost crazy age!\r\nThe political struggles of the reigns of the Charleses, and of the\r\nProtectorate of Cromwell, heated to frenzy by theological struggles.\r\nThose were the years following the advent and practical working of the\r\nReformation--but Catholicism is yet strong, and yet seeks supremacy. We\r\nthink our age full of the flush of men and doings, and culminations of\r\nwar and peace; and so it is. But there could hardly be a grander and\r\nmore picturesque and varied age than that.\r\n\r\nBorn out of and in this age, when Milton, Bunyan, Dryden and John Locke\r\nwere still living--amid the memories of Queen Elizabeth and James First,\r\nand the events of their reigns--when the radiance of that galaxy\r\nof poets, warriors, statesmen, captains, lords, explorers, wits and\r\ngentlemen, that crowded the courts and times of those sovereigns still\r\nfill'd the atmosphere--when America commencing to be explor'd and\r\nsettled commenc'd also to be suspected as destin'd to overthrow the old\r\nstandards and calculations--when Feudalism, like a sunset, seem'd\r\nto gather all its glories, reminiscences, personalisms, in one last\r\ngorgeous effort, before the advance of a new day, a new incipient\r\ngenius--amid the social and domestic circles of that period--indifferent\r\nto reverberations that seem'd enough to wake the dead, and in a sphere\r\nfar from the pageants of the court, the awe of any personal rank\r\nor charm of intellect, or literature, or the varying excitement of\r\nParliamentarian or Royalist fortunes--this curious young rustic goes\r\nwandering up and down England.\r\n\r\nGeorge Fox, born 1624, was of decent stock, in ordinary lower life--as\r\nhe grew along toward manhood, work'd at shoemaking, also at farm\r\nlabors--loved to be much by himself, half-hidden in the woods,\r\nreading the Bible--went about from town to town, dress'd in leather\r\nclothes--walk'd much at night, solitary, deeply troubled (\"the inward\r\ndivine teaching of the Lord\")--sometimes goes among the ecclesiastical\r\ngatherings of the great professors, and though a mere youth bears\r\nbold testimony--goes to and fro disputing--(must have had great\r\npersonality)--heard the voice of the Lord speaking articulately to\r\nhim, as he walk'd in the fields--feels resistless commands not to be\r\nexplain'd, but follow'd, to abstain from taking off his hat, to say\r\n_Thee_ and _Thou_, and not bid others Good morning or Good evening-was\r\nilliterate, could just read and write-testifies against shows, games,\r\nand frivolous pleasures--enters the courts and warns the judges that\r\nthey see to doing justice--goes into public houses and market-places,\r\nwith denunciations of drunkenness and money-making--rises in the midst\r\nof the church-services, and gives his own explanations of the ministers'\r\nexplanations, and of Bible passages and texts--sometimes for such things\r\nput in prison, sometimes struck fiercely on the mouth on the spot, or\r\nknock'd down, and lying there beaten and bloody--was of keen wit, ready\r\nto any question with the most apropos of answers--was sometimes press'd\r\nfor a soldier, (_him_ for a soldier!)--was indeed terribly buffeted;\r\nbut goes, goes, goes--often sleeping out-doors, under hedges, or\r\nhay stacks--forever taken before justices--improving such, and all\r\noccasions, to _bear testimony_, and give good advice--still enters the\r\n\"steeple-houses,\" (as he calls churches,) and though often dragg'd\r\nout and whipt till he faints away, and lies like one dead, when he\r\ncomes-to--stands up again, and offering himself all bruis'd and bloody,\r\ncries out to his tormenters, \"Strike--strike again, here where you have\r\nnot yet touch'd! my arms, my head, my cheeks,\"--Is at length arrested\r\nand sent up to London, confers with the Protector, Cromwell,--is set at\r\nliberty, and holds great meetings in London.\r\n\r\nThus going on, there is something in him that fascinates one or two\r\nhere, and three or four there, until gradually there were others who\r\nwent about in the same spirit, and by degrees the Society of Friends\r\ntook shape, and stood among the thousand religious sects of the world.\r\nWomen also catch the contagion, and go round, often shamefully misused.\r\nBy such contagion these ministerings, by scores, almost hundreds of poor\r\ntravelling men and women, keep on year after year, through ridicule,\r\nwhipping, imprisonment, &c.--some of the Friend-ministers emigrate to\r\nNew England--where their treatment makes the blackest part of the early\r\nannals of the New World. Some were executed, others maim'd, par-burnt,\r\nand scourg'd--two hundred die in prison--some on the gallows, or at the\r\nstake.\r\n\r\nGeorge Fox himself visited America, and found a refuge and hearers, and\r\npreach'd many times on Long Island, New York State. In the village\r\nof Oysterbay they will show you the rock on which he stood, (1672,)\r\naddressing the multitude, in the open air--thus rigidly following the\r\nfashion of apostolic times.--(I have heard myself many reminiscences of\r\nhim.) Flushing also contains (or contain'd--I have seen them) memorials\r\nof Fox, and his son, in two aged white-oak trees, that shaded him while\r\nhe bore his testimony to people gather'd in the highway.--Yes, the\r\nAmerican Quakers were much persecuted--almost as much, by a sort of\r\nconsent of all the other sects, as the Jews were in Europe in the\r\nmiddle ages. In New England, the cruelest laws were pass'd, and put in\r\nexecution against them. As said, some were whipt--women the same as\r\nmen. Some had their ears cut off--others their tongues pierc'd with hot\r\nirons--others their faces branded. Worse still, a woman and three men\r\nhad been hang'd, (1660.)--Public opinion, and the statutes, join'd\r\ntogether, in an odious union, Quakers, Baptists, Roman Catholics and\r\nWitches.--Such a fragmentary sketch of George Fox and his time--and the\r\nadvent of \"the Society of Friends\" in America.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may sound, Shakspere and George Fox, (think of them!\r\ncompare them!) were born and bred of similar stock, in much the same\r\nsurroundings and station in life--from the same England--and at\r\na similar period. One to radiate all of art's, all literature's\r\nsplendor--a splendor so dazzling that he himself is almost lost in it,\r\nand his contemporaries the same--his fictitious Othello, Romeo, Hamlet,\r\nLear, as real as any lords of England or Europe then and there--more\r\nreal to us, the mind sometimes thinks, than the man Shakspere himself.\r\nThen the other--may we indeed name him the same day? What is poor plain\r\nGeorge Fox compared to William Shakspere--to fancy's lord, imagination's\r\nheir? Yet George Fox stands for something too--a thought--the thought\r\nthat wakes in silent hours--perhaps the deepest, most eternal thought\r\nlatent in the human soul. This is the thought of God, merged in the\r\nthoughts of moral right and the immortality of identity. Great, great is\r\nthis thought--aye, greater than all else. When the gorgeous pageant of\r\nArt, refulgent in the sunshine, color'd with roses and gold--with all\r\nthe richest mere poetry, old or new, (even Shakespere's) with all that\r\nstatue, play, painting, music, architecture, oratory, can effect, ceases\r\nto satisfy and please--When the eager chase after wealth flags, and\r\nbeauty itself becomes a loathing--and when all worldly or carnal or\r\nesthetic, or even scientific values, having done their office to the\r\nhuman character, and minister'd their part to its development--then,\r\nif not before, comes forward this over-arching thought, and brings its\r\neligibilities, germinations. Most neglected in life of all humanity's\r\nattributes, easily cover'd with crust, deluded and abused, rejected, yet\r\nthe only certain source of what all are seeking, but few or none finding\r\nit I for myself clearly see the first, the last, the deepest depths and\r\nhighest heights of art, of literature, and of the purposes of life. I\r\nsay whoever labors here, makes contributions here, or best of all\r\nsets an incarnated example here, of life or death, is dearest to\r\nhumanity--remains after the rest are gone. And here, for these purposes,\r\nand up to the light that was in him, the man Elias Hicks--as the man\r\nGeorge Fox had done years before him--lived long, and died, faithful in\r\nlife, and faithful in death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOD-BYE MY FANCY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN OLD MAN'S REJOINDER\r\n\r\nIn the domain of Literature loftily consider'd (an accomplish'd and\r\nveteran critic in his just out work[44] now says,) 'the kingdom of the\r\nFather has pass'd; the kingdom of the Son is passing; the kingdom of the\r\nSpirit begins.' Leaving the reader to chew on and extract the juice and\r\nmeaning of this, I will proceed to say in melanged form what I have had\r\nbrought out by the English author's essay (he discusses the poetic art\r\nmostly) on my own, real, or by him supposed, views and purports. If I\r\ngive any answers to him, or explanations of what my books intend, they\r\nwill be not direct but indirect and derivative. Of course this brief\r\njotting is personal. Something very like querulous egotism and growling\r\nmay break through the narrative (for I have been and am rejected by all\r\nthe great magazines, carry now my 72d annual burden, and have been a\r\nparalytic for 18 years.)\r\n\r\nNo great poem or other literary or artistic work of any scope, old\r\nor new, can be essentially consider'd without weighing first the age,\r\npolitics (or want of politics) and aim, visible forms, unseen soul, and\r\ncurrent times, out of the midst of which it rises and is formulated:\r\nas the Biblic canticles and their days and spirit--as the Homeric, or\r\nDante's utterance, or Shakspere's, or the old Scotch or Irish ballads,\r\nor Ossian, or Omar Khayyam. So I have conceiv'd and launch'd, and work'd\r\nfor years at, my 'Leaves of Grass'--personal emanations only at best,\r\nbut with specialty of emergence and background--the ripening of the\r\nnineteenth century, the thought and fact and radiation of individuality,\r\nof America, the secession war, and showing the democratic conditions\r\nsupplanting everything that insults them or impedes their aggregate way.\r\nDoubtless my poems illustrate (one of novel thousands to come for a long\r\nperiod) those conditions; but \"democratic art\" will have to wait long\r\nbefore it is satisfactorily formulated and defined--if it ever is.\r\n\r\nI will now for one indicative moment lock horns with what many Think\r\nthe greatest thing, the question of _art_, so-call'd. I have not seen\r\nwithout learning something therefrom, how, with hardly an exception,\r\nthe poets of this age devote themselves, always mainly, sometimes\r\naltogether, to fine rhyme, spicy verbalism, the fabric and cut of the\r\ngarment, jewelry, _concetti_, style, art. To-day these adjuncts\r\nare certainly the effort, beyond all else, yet the lesson of Nature\r\nundoubtedly is, to proceed with single purpose toward the result\r\nnecessitated, and for which the time has arrived, utterly regardless of\r\nthe outputs of shape, appearance or criticism, which are always left to\r\nsettle themselves. I have not only not bother'd much about style,\r\nform, art, etc., but confess to more or less apathy (I believe I have\r\nsometimes caught myself in decided aversion) toward them throughout,\r\nasking nothing of them but negative advantages--that they should never\r\nimpede me, and never under any circumstances, or for their own purposes\r\nonly, assume any mastery over me.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning I have watch'd the sharp and sometimes heavy and\r\ndeep-penetrating objections and reviews against my work, and I hope\r\nentertain'd and audited them; (for I have probably had an advantage in\r\nconstructing from a central and unitary principle since the first, but\r\nat long intervals and stages--sometimes lapses of five or six years, or\r\npeace or war.) Ruskin, the Englishman, charges as a fearful and serious\r\nlack that my poems have no humor. A profound German critic complains\r\nthat, compared with the luxuriant and well-accepted songs of the world,\r\nthere is about my verse a certain coldness, severity, absence of spice,\r\npolish, or of consecutive meaning and plot. (The book is autobiographic\r\nat bottom, and may-be I do not exhibit and make ado about the stock\r\npassions: I am partly of Quaker stock.) Then E.C. Stedman finds (or\r\nfound) mark'd fault with me because while celebrating the common people\r\n_en masse_, I do not allow enough heroism and moral merit and good\r\nintentions to the choicer classes, the college-bred, the _état-major_.\r\nIt is quite probable that S. is right in the matter. In the main I\r\nmyself look, and have from the first look'd, to the bulky democratic\r\n_torso_ of the United States even for esthetic and moral attributes\r\nof serious account--and refused to aim at or accept anything less. If\r\nAmerica is only for the rule and fashion and small typicality of other\r\nlands (the rule of the _état-major_) it is not the land I take it for,\r\nand should to-day feel that my literary aim and theory had been blanks\r\nand misdirections. Strictly judged, most modern poems are but larger\r\nor smaller lumps of sugar, or slices of toothsome sweet cake--even the\r\nbanqueters dwelling on those glucose flavors as a main part of the dish.\r\nWhich perhaps leads to something: to have great heroic poetry we need\r\ngreat readers--a heroic appetite and audience. Have we at present any\r\nsuch?\r\n\r\nThen the thought at the centre, never too often repeated. Boundless\r\nmaterial wealth, free political organization, immense geographic\r\narea, and unprecedented \"business\" and products--even the most active\r\nintellect and \"culture\"--will not place this Commonwealth of ours on the\r\ntopmost range of history and humanity--or any eminence of \"democratic\r\nart\"--to say nothing of its pinnacle. Only the production (and on the\r\nmost copious scale) of loftiest moral, spiritual and heroic personal\r\nillustrations--a great native Literature headed with a Poetry stronger\r\nand sweeter than any yet. If there can be any such thing as a kosmic\r\nmodern and original song, America needs it, and is worthy of it.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion to-day (bitter as it is to say so) the outputs through\r\ncivilized nations everywhere from the great words Literature, Art,\r\nReligion, &c., with their conventional administerers, stand squarely in\r\nthe way of what the vitalities of those great words signify, more than\r\nthey really prepare the soil for them--or plant the seeds, or cultivate\r\nor garner the crop. My own opinion has long been, that for New World\r\nservice our ideas of beauty (inherited from the Greeks, and so on to\r\nShakspere--_query_--perverted from them?) need to be radically changed,\r\nand made anew for to-day's purposes and finer standards. But if so,\r\nit will all come in due time--the real change will be an autochthonic,\r\ninterior, constitutional, even local one, from which our notions of\r\nbeauty (lines and colors are wondrous lovely, but character is lovelier)\r\nwill branch or offshoot.\r\n\r\nSo much have I now rattled off (old age's garrulity,) that there is not\r\nspace for explaining the most important and pregnant principle of all,\r\nviz., that Art is one, is not partial, but includes all times and forms\r\nand sorts--is not exclusively aristocratic or democratic, or oriental or\r\noccidental. My favorite symbol would be a good font of type, where the\r\nimpeccable long-primer rejects nothing. Or the old Dutch flour-miller\r\nwho said, \"I never bother myself what road the folks come--I only want\r\ngood wheat and rye.\"\r\n\r\nThe font is about the same forever. Democratic art results of democratic\r\ndevelopment, from tinge, true nationality, belief, in the one setting up\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n[44] Two new volumes, \"Essays Speculative and Suggestive,\" by John\r\nAddington Symonds. One of the Essays is on \"Democratic Art,\" in which I\r\nand my books are largely alluded to and cited and dissected. It is\r\nthis part of the vols. that has caused the off-hand lines above--(first\r\nthanking Mr. S. for his invariable courtesy of personal treatment).\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD POETS\r\n\r\nPoetry (I am clear) is eligible of something far more ripen'd and ample,\r\nour lands and pending days, than it has yet produced from any utterance\r\nold or new. Modern or new poetry, too, (viewing or challenging it with\r\nsevere criticism,) is largely a-void--while the very cognizance, or even\r\nsuspicion of that void, and the need of filling it, proves a certainty\r\nof the hidden and waiting supply. Leaving other lands and languages to\r\nspeak for themselves, we can abruptly but deeply suggest it best from\r\nour own--going first to oversea illustrations, and standing on them.\r\nThink of Byron, Burns, Shelley, Keats, (even first-raters, \"the brothers\r\nof the radiant summit,\" as William O'Connor calls them,) as having done\r\nonly their precursory and 'prentice work, and all their best and real\r\npoems being left yet unwrought, untouch'd. Is it difficult to imagine\r\nahead of us and them, evolv'd from them, poesy completer far than any\r\nthey themselves fulfill'd? One has in his eye and mind some very large,\r\nvery old, entirely sound and vital tree or vine, like certain hardy,\r\never-fruitful specimens in California and Canada, or down in\r\nMexico, (and indeed in all lands) beyond the chronological\r\nrecords--illustrations of growth, continuity, power, amplitude\r\nand _exploitation_, almost beyond statement, but proving fact and\r\npossibility, outside of argument.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, indeed, the rarest and most blessed quality of transcendent\r\nnoble poetry--as of law, and of the profoundest wisdom and\r\nestheticism--is, (I would suggest,) from sane, completed, vital, capable\r\nold age.\r\n\r\nThe final proof of song or personality is a sort of matured, accreted,\r\nsuperb, evoluted, almost divine, impalpable diffuseness and atmosphere\r\nor invisible magnetism, dissolving and embracing all--and not any\r\nspecial achievement of passion, pride, metrical form, epigram, plot,\r\nthought, or what is call'd beauty. The bud of the rose or the half-blown\r\nflower is beautiful, of course, but only the perfected bloom or apple\r\nor finish'd wheat-head is beyond the rest. Completed fruitage like\r\nthis comes (in my opinion) to a grand age, in man or woman, through an\r\nessentially sound continuated physiology and psychology (both important)\r\nand is the culminating glorious aureole of all and several preceding.\r\nLike the tree or vine just mention'd, it stands at last in a beauty,\r\npower and productiveness of its own, above all others, and of a sort and\r\nstyle uniting all criticisms, proofs and adherences.\r\n\r\nLet us diversify the matter a little by portraying some of the American\r\npoets from our own point of view.\r\n\r\nLongfellow, reminiscent, polish'd, elegant, with the air of finest\r\nconventional library, picture-gallery or parlor, with ladies and\r\ngentlemen in them, and plush and rosewood, and ground-glass lamps, and\r\nmahogany and ebony furniture, and a silver inkstand and scented satin\r\npaper to write on.\r\n\r\nWhittier stands for morality (not in any all-accepting philosophic or\r\nHegelian sense, but) filter'd through a Puritanical or Quaker filter--is\r\nincalculably valuable as a genuine utterance, (and the finest,)--with\r\nmany local and Yankee and _genre_ bits--all hued with anti-slavery\r\ncoloring--(the _genre_ and anti-slavery contributions all precious--all\r\nhelp.) Whittier's is rather a grand figure, but pretty lean and\r\nascetic--no Greek-not universal and composite enough (don't try--don't\r\nwish to be) for ideal Americanism. Ideal Americanism would take the\r\nGreek spirit and law, and democratize and scientize and (thence) truly\r\nChristianize them for the whole, the globe, all history, all ranks\r\nand lands, all facts, all good and bad. (Ah this _bad_--this\r\nnineteen-twentieths of us all! What a stumbling-block it remains for\r\npoets and metaphysicians--what a chance (the strange, clear-as-ever\r\ninscription on the old dug-up tablet) it offers yet for being\r\ntranslated--what can be its purpose in the God-scheme of this universe,\r\nand all?)\r\n\r\nThen William Cullen Bryant--meditative, serious, from first to last\r\ntending to threnodies--his genius mainly lyrical--when reading his\r\npieces who could expect or ask for more magnificent ones than such\r\nas \"The Battle-Field,\" and \"A Forest Hymn\"? Bryant, unrolling,\r\nprairie-like, notwithstanding his mountains and lakes--moral enough\r\n(yet worldly and conventional)--a naturalist, pedestrian, gardener\r\nand fruiter--well aware of books, but mixing to the last in cities and\r\nsociety. I am not sure but his name ought to lead the list of American\r\nbards. Years ago I thought Emerson pre eminent (and as to the last\r\npolish and intellectual cuteness may-be I think so still)--but, for\r\nreasons, I have been gradually tending to give the file-leading place\r\nfor American native poesy to W. C. B.\r\n\r\nOf Emerson I have to confirm my already avow'd opinion regarding his\r\nhighest bardic and personal attitude. Of the galaxy of the past--of Poe,\r\nHalleck, Mrs. Sigourney, Allston, Willis, Dana,\r\n\r\nJohn Pierpont, W. G. Simms, Robert Sands, Drake, Hillhouse, Theodore\r\nFay, Margaret Fuller, Epes Sargent, Boker, Paul Hayne, Lanier, and\r\nothers, I fitly in essaying such a theme as this, and reverence for\r\ntheir memories, may at least give a heart-benison on the list of their\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nTime and New World humanity having the venerable resemblances more than\r\nanything else, and being \"the same subject continued,\" just here in\r\n1890, one gets a curious nourishment and lift (I do) from all those\r\ngrand old veterans, Bancroft, Kossuth, von Moltke--and such typical\r\nspecimen-reminiscences as Sophocles and Goethe, genius, health, beauty\r\nof person, riches, rank, renown and length of days, all combining and\r\ncentering in one case.\r\n\r\nAbove everything, what could humanity and literature do without the\r\nmellow, last-justifying, averaging, bringing-up of many, many years--a\r\ngreat old age amplified? Every really first-class production has likely\r\nto pass through the crucial tests of a generation, perhaps several\r\ngenerations. Lord Bacon says the first sight of any work really new\r\nand first-rate in beauty and originality always arouses something\r\ndisagreeable and repulsive. Voltaire term'd the Shaksperean works \"a\r\nhuge dunghill\"; Hamlet he described (to the Academy, whose members\r\nlisten'd with approbation) as \"the dream of a drunken savage, with a\r\nfew flashes of beautiful thoughts.\" And not the Ferney sage alone;\r\nthe orthodox judges and law-givers of France, such as La Harpe, J. L.\r\nGeoffrey, and Chateaubriand, either join'd in Voltaire's verdict, or\r\nwent further. Indeed the classicists and regulars there still hold to\r\nit. The lesson is very significant in all departments. People resent\r\nanything new as a personal insult. When umbrellas were first used in\r\nEngland, those who carried them were hooted and pelted so furiously that\r\ntheir lives were endanger'd. The same rage encounter'd the attempt in\r\ntheatricals to perform women's parts by real women, which was publicly\r\nconsider'd disgusting and outrageous. Byron thought Pope's verse\r\nincomparably ahead of Homer and Shakspere. One of the prevalent\r\nobjections, in the days of Columbus was, the learn'd men boldly asserted\r\nthat if a ship should reach India she would never get back again,\r\nbecause the rotundity of the globe would present a kind of mountain, up\r\nwhich it would be impossible to sail even with the most favorable wind.\r\n\r\n\"Modern poets,\" says a leading Boston journal, \"enjoy longevity.\r\nBrowning lived to be seventy-seven. Wordsworth, Bryant, Emerson, and\r\nLongfellow were old men. Whittier, Tennyson, and Walt Whitman still\r\nlive.\"\r\n\r\nStarted out by that item on Old Poets and Poetry for chyle to inner\r\nAmerican sustenance--I have thus gossipp'd about it all, and treated it\r\nfrom my own point of view, taking the privilege of rambling wherever the\r\ntalk carried me. Browning is lately dead; Bryant, Emerson and Longfellow\r\nhave not long pass'd away; and yes, Whittier and Tennyson remain, over\r\neighty years old--the latter having sent out not long since a fresh\r\nvolume, which the English-speaking Old and New Worlds are yet reading. I\r\nhave already put on record my notions of T. and his effusions: they are\r\nvery attractive and flowery to me--but flowers, too, are at least as\r\nprofound as anything; and by common consent T. is settled as the poetic\r\ncream-skimmer of our age's melody, _ennui_ and polish--a verdict in\r\nwhich I agree, and should say that nobody (not even Shakspere)\r\ngoes deeper in those exquisitely touch'd and half-hidden hints and\r\nindirections left like faint perfumes in the crevices of his lines. Of\r\nBrowning I don't know enough to say much; he must be studied deeply out,\r\ntoo, and quite certainly repays the trouble--but I am old and indolent,\r\nand cannot study (and never did.)\r\n\r\nGrand as to-day's accumulative fund of poetry is, there is certainly\r\nsomething unborn, not yet come forth, different from anything\r\nnow formulated in any verse, or contributed by the past in any\r\nland--something waited for, craved, hitherto non-express'd. What it\r\nwill be, and how, no one knows. It will probably have to prove itself by\r\nitself and its readers. One thing, it must run through entire humanity\r\n(this new word and meaning Solidarity has arisen to us moderns) twining\r\nall lands like a divine thread, stringing all beads, pebbles or gold,\r\nfrom God and the soul, and like God's dynamics and sunshine illustrating\r\nall and having reference to all. From anything like a cosmical point of\r\nview, the entirety of imaginative literature's themes and results as\r\nwe get them to-day seems painfully narrow. All that has been put in\r\nstatement, tremendous as it is, what is it compared with the vast fields\r\nand values and varieties left unreap'd? Of our own country, the splendid\r\nraces North or South, and especially of the Western and Pacific regions,\r\nit sometimes seems to me their myriad noblest Homeric and Biblic\r\nelements are all untouch'd, left as if ashamed of, and only certain very\r\nminor occasional _delirium tremens_ glints studiously sought and put in\r\nprint, in short tales, \"poetry\" or books.\r\n\r\nI give these speculations, or notions, in all their audacity, for the\r\ncomfort of thousands--perhaps a majority of ardent minds, women's and\r\nyoung men's--who stand in awe and despair before the immensity of suns\r\nand stars already in the firmament. Even in the Iliad and Shakspere\r\nthere is (is there not?) a certain humiliation produced to us by the\r\nabsorption of them, unless we sound in equality, or above them,\r\nthe songs due our own democratic era and surroundings, and the full\r\nassertion of ourselves. And in vain (such is my opinion) will\r\nAmerica seek successfully to tune any superb national song unless the\r\nheart-strings of the people start it from their own breasts--to be\r\nreturn'd and echoed there again.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHIP AHOY\r\n\r\n    In dreams I was a ship, and sail'd the boundless seas,\r\n    Sailing and ever sailing--all seas and into every port, or out\r\n      upon the offing,\r\n    Saluting, cheerily hailing each mate, met or pass'd, little or big,\r\n    \"Ship ahoy!\" thro' trumpet or by voice--if nothing more, some\r\n      friendly merry word at least,\r\n    For companionship and good will for ever to all and each.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR QUEEN VICTORIA'S BIRTHDAY\r\n\r\n_An American arbutus bunch to be put in a little vase on the royal\r\nbreakfast table May 24th, 1890_.\r\n\r\nLady, accept a birth-day thought--haply an idle gift and token, Right\r\nfrom the scented soil's May-utterance here, (Smelling of countless\r\nblessings, prayers, and old-time thanks,)[45] A bunch of white and pink\r\narbutus, silent, spicy, shy, From Hudson's, Delaware's, or Potomac's\r\nwoody banks.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n[45] NOTE.--Very little, as we Americans stand this day, with our\r\nsixty-five or seventy millions of population, an immense surplus in the\r\ntreasury, and all that actual power or reserve power (land and sea) so\r\ndear to nations--very little I say do we realize that curious crawling\r\nnational shudder when the \"Trent affair\" promis'd to bring upon us a war\r\nwith Great Britain--follow'd unquestionably, as that war would have, by\r\nrecognition of the Southern Confederacy from all the leading European\r\nnations. It is now certain that all this then inevitable train of\r\ncalamity hung on arrogant and peremptory phrases in the prepared and\r\nwritten missive of the British Minister, to America, which the Queen\r\n(and Prince Albert latent) positively and promptly cancell'd; and which\r\nher firm attitude did alone actually erase and leave out, against all\r\nthe other official prestige and Court of St. James's. On such minor and\r\npersonal incidents (so to call them,) often depend the great growths and\r\nturns of civilization. This moment of a woman and a queen surely swung\r\nthe grandest oscillation of modern history's pendulum. Many sayings and\r\ndoings of that period, from foreign potentates and powers, might well be\r\ndropt in oblivion by America--but never _this_, if I could have my way.\r\nW. W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN NATIONAL LITERATURE\r\n\r\n_Is there any such thing--or can there ever be?_\r\n\r\n\r\nSo you want an essay about American National Literature, (tremendous\r\nand fearful subject!) do you?[46] Well, if you will let me put down some\r\nmelanged cogitations regarding the matter, hap-hazard, and from my own\r\npoints of view, I will try. Horace Greeley wrote a book named \"Hints\r\ntoward Reforms,\" and the title-line was consider'd the best part of all.\r\nIn the present case I will give a few thoughts and suggestions, of good\r\nand ambitious intent enough anyhow--first reiterating the question right\r\nout plainly: American National Literature--is there distinctively\r\nany such thing, or can there ever be? First to me comes an almost\r\nindescribably august form, the People, with varied typical shapes and\r\nattitudes-then the divine mirror, Literature.\r\n\r\nAs things are, probably no more puzzling question ever offer'd itself\r\nthan (going back to old Nile for a trope,) What bread-seeds of printed\r\nmentality shall we cast upon America's waters, to grow and return after\r\nmany days? Is there for the future authorship of the United States any\r\nbetter way than submission to the teeming facts, events, activities, and\r\nimportations already vital through and beneath them all? I have often\r\nponder'd it, and felt myself disposed to let it go at that. Indeed, are\r\nnot those facts and activities and importations potent and certain to\r\nfulfil themselves all through our Commonwealth, irrespective of any\r\nattempt from individual guidance? But allowing all, and even at that,\r\na good part of the matter being honest discussion, examination, and\r\nearnest personal presentation, we may even for sanitary exercise and\r\ncontact plunge boldly into the spread of the many waves and cross-tides,\r\nas follows. Or, to change the figure, I will present my varied little\r\ncollation (what is our Country itself but an infinitely vast and varied\r\ncollation?) in the hope that the show itself indicates a duty getting\r\nmore and more incumbent every day.\r\n\r\nIn general, civilization's totality or real representative National\r\nLiterature formates itself (like language, or \"the weather\") not\r\nfrom two or three influences, however important, nor from any learned\r\nsyllabus, or criticism, or what ought to be, nor from any minds\r\nor advice of toploftical quarters--and indeed not at all from the\r\ninfluences and ways ostensibly supposed (though they too are adopted,\r\nafter a sort)--but slowly, slowly, curiously, from many more and more,\r\ndeeper mixings and siftings (especially in America) and generations\r\nand years and races, and what largely appears to be chance--but is not\r\nchance at all. First of all, for future National Literature in America,\r\nNew England (the technically moral and schoolmaster region, as a cynical\r\nfellow I know calls it) and the three or four great Atlantic-coast\r\ncities, highly as they to-day suppose they dominate the whole, will\r\nhave to haul in their horns. _Ensemble_ is the tap-root of National\r\nLiterature. America is become already a huge world of peoples, rounded\r\nand orbic climates, idiocrasies, and geographies--forty-four Nations\r\ncuriously and irresistibly blent and aggregated in ONE NATION, with one\r\nimperial language, and one unitary set of social and legal standards\r\nover all--and (I predict) a yet to be National Literature. (In my mind\r\nthis last, if it ever comes, is to prove grander and more important for\r\nthe Commonwealth than its politics and material wealth and trade, vast\r\nand indispensable as those are.)\r\n\r\nThink a moment what must, beyond peradventure, be the real permanent\r\nsub-bases, or lack of them. Books profoundly considered show a great\r\nnation more than anything else--more than laws or manners. (This is,\r\nof course, probably the deep-down meaning of that well-buried but\r\never-vital platitude, Let me sing the people's songs, and I don't care\r\nwho makes their laws.) Books too reflect humanity _en masse_, and surely\r\nshow them splendidly, or the reverse, and prove or celebrate their\r\nprevalent traits (these last the main things.) Homer grew out of and\r\nhas held the ages, and holds to-day, by the universal admiration\r\nfor personal prowess, courage, rankness, _amour propre_, leadership,\r\ninherent in the whole human race. Shakspere concentrates the brilliancy\r\nof the centuries of feudalism on the proud personalities they produced,\r\nand paints the amorous passion. The books of the Bible stand for the\r\nfinal superiority of devout emotions over the rest, and of religious\r\nadoration, and ultimate absolute justice, more powerful than haughtiest\r\nkings or millionaires or majorities.\r\n\r\nWhat the United States are working out and establishing needs\r\nimperatively the connivance of something subtler than ballots and\r\nlegislators. The Goethean theory and lesson (if I may briefly state\r\nit so) of the exclusive sufficiency of artistic, scientific, literary\r\nequipment to the character, irrespective of any strong claims of the\r\npolitical ties of nation, state, or city, could have answer'd under the\r\nconventionality and pettiness of Weimar, or the Germany, or even Europe,\r\nof those times; but it will not do for America to-day at all. We have\r\nnot only to exploit our own theory above any that has preceded us, but\r\nwe have entirely different, and deeper-rooted, and infinitely broader\r\nthemes.\r\n\r\nWhen I have had a chance to see and observe a sufficient crowd of\r\nAmerican boys or maturer youths or well-grown men, all the States, as in\r\nmy experiences in the secession war among the soldiers, or west,\r\neast, north, or south, or my wanderings and loiterings through cities\r\n(especially New York and in Washington,) I have invariably found coming\r\nto the front three prevailing personal traits, to be named here for\r\nbrevity's sake under the heads Good-Nature, Decorum, and Intelligence.\r\n(I make Good-Nature first, as it deserves to be--it is a splendid\r\nresultant of all the rest, like health or fine weather.) Essentially\r\nthese lead the inherent list of the high average personal born and bred\r\nqualities of the young fellows everywhere through the United States,\r\nas any sharp observer can find out for himself. Surely these make the\r\nvertebral stock of superbest and noblest nations! May the destinies show\r\nit so forthcoming. I mainly confide the whole future of our Commonwealth\r\nto the fact of these three bases. Need I say I demand the same in the\r\nelements and spirit and fruitage of National Literature?\r\n\r\nAnother, perhaps a born root or branch, comes under the words _Noblesse\r\nOblige_, even for a national rule or motto. My opinion is that this\r\nforegoing phrase, and its spirit, should influence and permeate official\r\nAmerica and its representatives in Congress, the Executive Departments,\r\nthe Presidency, and the individual States--should be one of their\r\nchiefest mottoes, and be carried out practically. (I got the idea from\r\nmy dear friend the democratic Englishwoman, Mrs. Anne Gilchrist, now\r\ndead. \"The beautiful words _Noblesse Oblige_,\" said she to me once,\r\n\"are not best for some develop'd gentleman or lord, but some rich and\r\ndevelop'd nation--and especially for your America.\")\r\n\r\nThen another and very grave point (for this discussion is deep,\r\ndeep--not for trifles, or pretty seemings.) I am not sure but the\r\nestablish'd and old (and superb and profound, and, one may say, needed\r\nas old) conception of Deity as mainly of moral constituency (goodness,\r\npurity, sinlessness, &c.) has been undermined by nineteenth-century\r\nideas and science. What does this immense and almost abnormal\r\ndevelopment of Philanthropy mean among the moderns? One doubts if there\r\never will come a day when the moral laws and moral standards will be\r\nsupplanted as over all: while time proceeds (I find it so myself) they\r\nwill probably be intrench'd deeper and expanded wider. Then the expanded\r\nscientific and democratic and truly philosophic and poetic quality\r\nof modernism demands a Deific identity and scope superior to all\r\nlimitations, and essentially including just as well the so-call'd\r\nevil and crime and criminals--all the malformations, the defective and\r\nabortions of the universe.\r\n\r\nSometimes the bulk of the common people (who are far more 'cute than the\r\ncritics suppose) relish a well-hidden allusion or hint carelessly dropt,\r\nfaintly indicated, and left to be disinterr'd or not. Some of the very\r\nold ballads have delicious morsels of this kind. Greek Aristophanes and\r\nPindar abounded in them. (I sometimes fancy the old Hellenic audiences\r\nmust have been as generally keen and knowing as any of their poets.)\r\nShakspere is full of them. Tennyson has them. It is always a capital\r\ncompliment from author to reader, and worthy the peering brains of\r\nAmerica. The mere smartness of the common folks, however, does not need\r\nencouraging, but qualities more solid and opportune.\r\n\r\nWhat are now deepest wanted in the States as roots for their literature\r\nare Patriotism, Nationality, Ensemble, or the ideas of these, and the\r\nuncompromising genesis and saturation of these. Not the mere bawling\r\nand braggadocio of them, but the radical emotion-facts, the fervor and\r\nperennial fructifying spirit at fountain-head. And at the risk of being\r\nmisunderstood I should dwell on and repeat that a great imaginative\r\n_literatus_ for America can never be merely good and moral in the\r\nconventional method. Puritanism and what radiates from it must always\r\nbe mention'd by me with respect; then I should say, for this vast and\r\nvaried Commonwealth, geographically and artistically, the puritanical\r\nstandards are constipated, narrow, and non-philosophic.\r\n\r\nIn the main I adhere to my positions in \"Democratic Vistas,\" and\r\nespecially to my summing-up of American literature as far as to-day is\r\nconcern'd. In Scientism, the Medical Profession, Practical Inventions,\r\nand Journalism, the United States have press'd forward to the glorious\r\nfront rank of advanced civilized lands, as also in the popular\r\ndissemination of printed matter (of a superficial nature perhaps, but\r\nthat is an indispensable preparatory stage,) and have gone in common\r\neducation, so-call'd, far beyond any other land or age. Yet the\r\nhigh-pitch'd taunt of Margaret Fuller, forty years ago, still sounds in\r\nthe air: \"It does not follow, because the United States print and read\r\nmore books, magazines, and newspapers than all the rest of the world,\r\nthat they really have therefore a literature.\" For perhaps it is not\r\nalone the free schools and newspapers, nor railroads and factories,\r\nnor all the iron, cotton, wheat, pork, and petroleum, nor the gold and\r\nsilver, nor the surplus of a hundred or several hundred millions, nor\r\nthe Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, nor the last national census,\r\nthat can put this Commonweal high or highest on the cosmical scale of\r\nhistory. Something else is indispensable. All that record is lofty, but\r\nthere is a loftier.\r\n\r\nThe great current points are perhaps simple, after all: first, that the\r\nhighest developments of the New World and Democracy, and probably the\r\nbest society of the civilized world all over, are to be only reach'd\r\nand spinally nourish'd (in my notion) by a new evolutionary sense and\r\ntreatment; and, secondly, that the evolution-principle, which is the\r\ngreatest law through nature, and of course in these States, has now\r\nreach'd us markedly for and in our literature.\r\n\r\nIn other writings I have tried to show how vital to any aspiring\r\nNationality must ever be its autochthonic song, and how for a really\r\ngreat people there can be no complete and glorious Name, short of\r\nemerging out of and even rais'd on such born poetic expression, coming\r\nfrom its own soil and soul, its area, spread, idiosyncrasies, and (like\r\nshowers of rain, originally rising impalpably, distill'd from land and\r\nsea,) duly returning there again. Nor do I forget what we all owe to\r\nour ancestry; though perhaps we are apt to forgive and bear too much for\r\nthat alone.\r\n\r\nOne part of the national American literatus's task is (and it is not an\r\neasy one) to treat the old hereditaments, legends, poems, theologies,\r\nand even customs, with fitting respect and toleration, and at the same\r\ntime clearly understand and justify, and be devoted to and exploit our\r\nown day, its diffused light, freedom, responsibilities, with all\r\nit necessitates, and that our New-World circumstances and stages of\r\ndevelopment demand and make proper. For American literature we want\r\nmighty authors, _not_ even Carlyle- and Heine-like, born and brought\r\nup in (and more or less essentially partaking and giving out) that vast\r\nabnormal ward or hysterical sick-chamber which in many respects Europe,\r\nwith all its glories, would seem to be. The greatest feature in current\r\npoetry (perhaps in literature anyhow) is the almost total lack of\r\nfirst-class power, and simple, natural health, flourishing and produced\r\nat first hand, typifying our own era. Modern verse generally lacks quite\r\naltogether the modern, and is oftener possess'd in spirit with the past\r\nand feudal, dressed may-be in late fashions. For novels and plays often\r\nthe plots and surfaces are contemporary--but the spirit, even the fun,\r\nis morbid and effete.\r\n\r\nThere is an essential difference between the Old and New. The poems of\r\nAsia and Europe are rooted in the long past. They celebrate man and his\r\nintellections and relativenesses as they have been. But America, in as\r\nhigh a strain as ever, is to sing them all as they are and are to be. (I\r\nknow, of course, that the past is probably a main factor in what we are\r\nand know and must be.) At present the States are absorb'd in business,\r\nmoney-making, politics, agriculture, the development of mines,\r\nintercommunications, and other material attents--which all shove forward\r\nand appear at their height--as, consistently with modern civilization,\r\nthey must be and should be. Then even these are but the inevitable\r\nprecedents and providers for home-born, transcendent, democratic\r\nliterature--to be shown in superior, more heroic, more spiritual, more\r\nemotional, personalities and songs. A national literature is, of\r\ncourse, in one sense, a great mirror or reflector. There must however\r\nbe something before--something to reflect. I should say now, since the\r\nsecession war, there has been, and to-day unquestionably exists, that\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nCertainly, anyhow, the United States do not so far utter poetry,\r\nfirst-rate literature, or any of the so-call'd arts, to any lofty\r\nadmiration or advantage--are not dominated or penetrated from actual\r\ninherence or plain bent to the said poetry and arts. Other work, other\r\nneeds, current inventions, productions, have occupied and to-day mainly\r\noccupy them. They are very 'cute and imitative and proud--can't\r\nbear being left too glaringly away far behind the other high-class\r\nnations--and so we set up some home \"poets,\" \"artists,\" painters,\r\nmusicians, _literati_, and so forth, all our own (thus claim'd.) The\r\nwhole matter has gone on, and exists to-day, probably as it should have\r\nbeen, and should be; as, for the present, it must be. To all which\r\nwe conclude, and repeat the terrible query: American National\r\nLiterature--is there distinctively any such thing, or can there ever be?\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n[46] The essay was for the _North American Review_, in answer to the\r\nformal request of the editor. It appear'd in March, 1891.\r\n\r\n\r\nGATHERING THE CORN\r\n\r\n\r\n_Last of October_.--Now mellow, crisp, Autumn days, bright moonlight\r\nnights, and gathering the corn--\"cutting up,\" as the farmers call it.\r\nNow, or of late, all over the country, a certain green and brown-drab\r\neloquence seeming to call out, \"You that pretend to give the news, and\r\nall that's going, why not give us a notice?\" Truly, O fields, as for the\r\nnotice,\r\n\r\n    \"Take, we give it willingly.\"\r\n\r\nOnly we must do it our own way. Leaving the domestic, dietary, and\r\ncommercial parts of the question (which are enormous, in fact, hardly\r\nsecond to those of any other of our great soil-products), we will just\r\nsaunter down a lane we know, on an average West Jersey farm, and let the\r\nfancy of the hour itemize America's most typical agricultural show and\r\nspecialty.\r\n\r\nGathering the Corn--the British call it Maize, the old Yankee farmer\r\nIndian Corn. The great plumes, the ears well-envelop'd in their husks,\r\nthe long and pointed leaves, in summer, like green or purple ribands,\r\nwith a yellow stem line in the middle, all now turn'd dingy; the sturdy\r\nstalks, and the rustling in the breeze--the breeze itself well tempering\r\nthe sunny noon--The varied reminiscences recall'd--the ploughing and\r\nplanting in spring--(the whole family in the field, even the little\r\ngirls and boys dropping seed in the hill)--the gorgeous sight through\r\nJuly and August--the walk and observation early in the day--the cheery\r\ncall of the robin, and the low whirr of insects in the grass--the\r\nWestern husking party, when ripe--the November moonlight gathering, and\r\nthe calls, songs, laughter of the young fellows.\r\n\r\nNot to forget, hereabouts, in the Middle States, the old worm fences,\r\nwith the gray rails and their scabs of moss and lichen--those old rails,\r\nweather beaten, but strong yet. Why not come down from literary dignity,\r\nand confess we are sitting on one now, under the shade of a great walnut\r\ntree? Why not confide that these lines are pencill'd on the edge of\r\na woody bank, with a glistening pond and creek seen through the trees\r\nsouth, and the corn we are writing about close at hand on the north?\r\nWhy not put in the delicious scent of the \"life everlasting\" that yet\r\nlingers so profusely in every direction--the chromatic song of the one\r\npersevering locust (the insect is scarcer this fall and the past summer\r\nthan for many years) beginning slowly, rising and swelling to much\r\nemphasis, and then abruptly falling--so appropriate to the scene, so\r\nquaint, so racy and suggestive in the warm sunbeams, we could sit here\r\nand look and listen for an hour? Why not even the tiny, turtle-shaped,\r\nyellow-back'd, black-spotted lady-bug that has lit on the shirt-sleeve\r\nof the arm inditing this? Ending our list with the fall-drying grass,\r\nthe Autumn days themselves,\r\n\r\n    Sweet days; so cool, so calm, so bright,\r\n\r\n(yet not so cool either, about noon)--the horse-mint, the wild carrot,\r\nthe mullein, and the bumble-bee.\r\n\r\nHow the half-mad vision of William Blake--how the far freer, far firmer\r\nfantasy that wrote \"Midsummer Night's Dream\"--would have revell'd night\r\nor day, and beyond stint, in one of our American corn fields! Truly, in\r\ncolor, outline, material and spiritual suggestiveness, where any more\r\ninclosing theme for idealist, poet, literary artist?\r\n\r\nWhat we have written has been at noon day--but perhaps better still\r\n(for this collation,) to steal off by yourself these fine nights, and\r\ngo slowly, musingly down the lane, when the dry and green-gray\r\nfrost-touch'd leaves seem whisper-gossipping all over the field in\r\nlow tones, as if every hill had something to say--and you sit or lean\r\nrecluse near by, and inhale that rare, rich, ripe and peculiar odor\r\nof the gather'd plant which comes out best only to the night air. The\r\ncomplex impressions of the far-spread fields and woods in the night, are\r\nblended mystically, soothingly, indefinitely, and yet palpably to you\r\n(appealing curiously, perhaps mostly, to the sense of smell.) All is\r\ncomparative silence and clear-shadow below, and the stars are up there\r\nwith Jupiter lording it over westward; sulky Saturn in the east, and\r\nover head the moon. A rare well-shadow'd hour! By no means the least of\r\nthe eligibilities of the gather'd corn!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DEATH-BOUQUET\r\n\r\n_Pick'd Noontime, early January, 1890_\r\n\r\n\r\nDeath--too great a subject to be treated so--indeed the greatest\r\nsubject--and yet I am giving you but a few random lines about it--as one\r\nwrites hurriedly the last part of a letter to catch the closing mail.\r\nOnly I trust the lines, especially the poetic bits quoted, may leave a\r\nlingering odor of spiritual heroism afterward. For I am probably fond\r\nof viewing all really great themes indirectly, and by side-ways and\r\nsuggestions. Certain music from wondrous voices or skilful players--then\r\npoetic glints still more--put the soul in rapport with death, or toward\r\nit. Hear a strain from Tennyson's late \"Crossing the Bar\":\r\n\r\n    Twilight and evening bell,\r\n        And after that the dark!\r\n    And may there be no sadness of farewell,\r\n        When I embark;\r\n\r\n    For tho' from out our bourne of Time and Place\r\n        The floods may bear me far,\r\n    I hope to see my Pilot face to face\r\n        When I have crost the bar.\r\n\r\nAm I starting the sail-craft of poets in line? Here then a quatrain of\r\nPhrynichus long ago to one of old Athens' favorites:\r\n\r\n    Thrice-happy Sophocles! in good old age,\r\n    Bless'd as a man, and as a craftsman bless'd,\r\n    He died; his many tragedies were fair,\r\n    And fair his end, nor knew he any sorrow.\r\n\r\nCertain music, indeed, especially voluntaries by a good player, at\r\ntwilight--or idle rambles alone by the shore, or over prairie or\r\non mountain road, for that matter--favor the right mood. Words are\r\ndifficult--even impossible. No doubt any one will recall ballads or\r\nsongs or hymns (may-be instrumental performances) that have arous'd\r\nso curiously, yet definitely, the thought of death, the mystic, the\r\nafter-realm, as no statement or sermon could--and brought it hovering\r\nnear. A happy (to call it so) and easy death is at least as much a\r\nphysiological result as a pyschological one. The foundation of it really\r\nbegins before birth, and is thence directly or indirectly shaped and\r\naffected, even constituted, (the base stomachic) by every thing from\r\nthat minute till the time of its occurrence. And yet here is something\r\n(Whittier's \"Burning Driftwood\") of an opposite coloring:\r\n\r\n    I know the solemn monotone\r\n        Of waters calling unto me;\r\n    I know from whence the airs have blown,\r\n        That whisper of the Eternal Sea;\r\n    As low my fires of driftwood burn,\r\n        I hear that sea's deep sounds increase,\r\n    And, fair in sunset light, discern\r\n        Its mirage-lifted Isles of Peace.\r\n\r\nLike an invisible breeze after a long and sultry day, death sometimes\r\nsets in at last, soothingly and refreshingly, almost vitally. In not\r\na few cases the termination even appears to be a sort of ecstasy. Of\r\ncourse there are painful deaths, but I do not believe such is at all the\r\ngeneral rule. Of the many hundreds I myself saw die in the fields and\r\nhospitals during the secession war the cases of mark' d suffering or\r\nagony _in extremis_ were very rare. (It is a curious suggestion of\r\nimmortality that the mental and emotional powers remain to their\r\nclearest through all, while the senses of pain and flesh volition are\r\nblunted or even gone.)\r\n\r\nThen to give the following, and cease before the thought gets\r\nthreadbare:\r\n\r\n    Now, land and life, finale, and farewell!\r\n    Now Voyager depart! (much, much for thee is yet in store;)\r\n    Often enough hast thou adventur'd o'er the seas,\r\n    Cautiously cruising, studying the charts,\r\n    Duly again to port and hawser's tie returning.\r\n    --But now obey thy cherish'd, secret wish,\r\n    Embrace thy friends--leave all in order;\r\n    To port and hawser's tie no more returning,\r\n    Depart upon thy endless cruise, old Sailor!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME LAGGARDS YET\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PERFECT HUMAN VOICE\r\n\r\nStating it briefly and pointedly I should suggest that the human voice\r\nis a cultivation or form'd growth on a fair native foundation. This\r\nfoundation probably exists in nine cases out of ten. Sometimes nature\r\naffords the vocal organ in perfection, or rather I would say near enough\r\nto whet one's appreciation and appetite for a voice that might be truly\r\ncall'd perfection. To me the grand voice is mainly physiological--(by\r\nwhich I by no means ignore the mental help, but wish to keep\r\nthe emphasis where it belongs.) Emerson says _manners_ form the\r\nrepresentative apex and final charm and captivation of humanity: but he\r\nmight as well have changed the typicality to voice.\r\n\r\nOf course there is much taught and written about elocution, the best\r\nreading, speaking, &c., but it finally settles down to _best_ human\r\nvocalization. Beyond all other power and beauty, there is something in\r\nthe quality and power of the right voice (_timbre_ the schools call\r\nit) that touches the soul, the abysms. It was not for nothing that\r\nthe Greeks depended, at their highest, on poetry's and wisdom's vocal\r\nutterance by _tete-a-tete_ lectures--(indeed all the ancients did.)\r\n\r\nOf celebrated people possessing this wonderful vocal power, patent to\r\nme, in former days, I should specify the contralto Alboni, Elias Hicks,\r\nFather Taylor, the tenor Bettini, Fanny Kemble, and the old actor Booth,\r\nand in private life many cases, often women. I sometimes wonder whether\r\nthe best philosophy and poetry, or something like the best, after all\r\nthese centuries, perhaps waits to be rous'd out yet, or suggested, by\r\nthe perfect physiological human voice.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHAKSPERE FOR AMERICA\r\n\r\nLet me send you a supplementary word to that \"view\" of Shakspere\r\nattributed to me, publish'd in your July number,[47] and so courteously\r\nworded by the reviewer (thanks! dear friend.) But you have left out\r\nwhat, perhaps, is the main point, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Even the one who at present reigns unquestion'd--of Shakspere--for all\r\nhe stands for so much in modern literature, he stands entirely for\r\nthe mighty esthetic sceptres of the past, not for the spiritual and\r\ndemocratic, the sceptres of the future.\" (See pp. 55-58 in \"November\r\nBoughs,\" and also some of my further notions on Shakspere.)\r\n\r\nThe Old World (Europe and Asia) is the region of the poetry of concrete\r\nand real things,--the past, the esthetic, palaces, etiquette, the\r\nliterature of war and love, the mythological gods, and the myths anyhow.\r\nBut the New World (America) is the region of the future, and its poetry\r\nmust be spiritual and democratic. Evolution is not the rule in Nature,\r\nin Politics, and Inventions only, but in Verse. I know our age is\r\ngreatly materialistic, but it is greatly spiritual, too, and the future\r\nwill be, too. Even what we moderns have come to mean by _spirituality_\r\n(while including what the Hebraic utterers, and mainly perhaps all the\r\nGreek and other old typical poets, and also the later ones, meant) has\r\nso expanded and color'd and vivified the comprehension of the term,\r\nthat it is quite a different one from the past. Then science, the final\r\ncritic of all, has the casting vote for future poetry.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n[47] This bit was in \"Poet-lore\" monthly for September, 1890.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"UNASSAIL'D RENOWN\"\r\n\r\nThe N. Y. _Critic_, Nov. 24, 1889, propounded a circular to several\r\npersons, and giving the responses, says, \"Walt Whitman's views [as\r\nfollow] are, naturally, more radical than those of any other contributor\r\nto the discussion\":\r\n\r\nBriefly to answer impromptu your request of Oct. 19--the question\r\nwhether I think any American poet not now living deserves a place\r\namong the thirteen \"English inheritors of unassail'd renown\" (Chaucer,\r\nSpenser, Shakspere, Milton, Dryden, Pope, Gray, Burns, Wordsworth,\r\nColeridge, Byron, Shelley and Keats,)--and which American poets would be\r\ntruly worthy, &c. Though to me the _deep_ of the matter goes down,\r\ndown beneath. I remember the London _Times_ at the time, in opportune,\r\nprofound and friendly articles on Bryant's and Longfellow's deaths,\r\nspoke of the embarrassment, warping effect, and confusion on America\r\n(her poets and poetic students) \"coming in possession of a great\r\nestate they had never lifted a hand to form or earn\"; and the further\r\ncontingency of \"the English language ever having annex'd to it a lot of\r\nfirst-class Poetry that would be American, not European\"--proving then\r\nsomething precious over all, and beyond valuation. But perhaps that\r\nis venturing outside the question. Of the thirteen British immortals\r\nmention'd--after placing Shakspere on a sort of pre-eminence of fame not\r\nto be invaded yet--the names of Bryant, Emerson, Whittier and Longfellow\r\n(with even added names, sometimes Southerners, sometimes Western or\r\nother writers of only one or two pieces,) deserve in my opinion an\r\nequally high niche of renown as belongs to any on the dozen of that\r\nglorious list.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSCRIPTION FOR A LITTLE BOOK ON GIORDANO BRUNO\r\n\r\nAs America's mental courage (the thought comes to me to-day) is so\r\nindebted, above all current lands and peoples, to the noble army of\r\nOld-World martyrs past, how incumbent on us that we clear those martyrs'\r\nlives and names, and hold them up for reverent admiration, as well\r\nas beacons. And typical of this, and standing for it and all perhaps,\r\nGiordano Bruno may well be put, to-day and to come, in our New World's\r\nthankfulest heart and memory.\r\n\r\nW.W. CAMDEN, NEW JERSEY, _February 24th, 1890_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPLINTERS\r\n\r\nWhile I stand in reverence before the fact of Humanity, the People, I\r\nwill confess, in writing my L. of G., the least consideration out of\r\nall that has had to do with it has been the consideration of \"the\r\npublic\"--at any rate as it now exists. Strange as it may sound for\r\na democrat to say so, I am clear that no free and original and\r\nlofty-soaring poem, or one ambitious of those achievements, can\r\npossibly be fulfill'd by any writer who has largely in his thought _the\r\npublic_--or the question, What will establish'd literature--What will\r\nthe current authorities say about it?\r\n\r\nAs far as I have sought any, not the best laid out garden or parterre\r\nhas been my model--but Nature has been. I know that in a sense the\r\ngarden is nature too, but I had to choose--I could not give both.\r\nBesides the gardens are well represented in poetry; while Nature (in\r\nletter and in spirit, in the divine essence,) little if at all.\r\n\r\nCertainly, (while I have not hit it by a long shot,) I have aim'd at the\r\nmost ambitious, the best--and sometimes feel to advance that aim (even\r\nwith all its arrogance) as the most redeeming part of my books. I have\r\nnever so much cared to feed the esthetic or intellectual palates--but if\r\nI could arouse from its slumbers that eligibility in every soul for its\r\nown true exercise! if I could only wield that lever!\r\n\r\nOut from the well-tended concrete and the physical--and in them and from\r\nthem only--radiate the spiritual and heroic.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly many points belonging to this essay--perhaps of the\r\ngreatest necessity, fitness and importance to it--have been left out\r\nor forgotten. But the amount of the whole matter--poems, preface and\r\neverything--is merely to make one of those little punctures or eyelets\r\nthe actors possess in the theatre-curtains to look out upon \"the\r\nhouse\"--one brief, honest, living glance.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEALTH, (OLD STYLE)\r\n\r\nIn that condition the whole body is elevated to a state by others\r\nunknown--inwardly and outwardly illuminated, purified, made solid,\r\nstrong, yet buoyant. A singular charm, more than beauty, flickers out\r\nof, and over, the face--a curious transparency beams in the eyes,\r\nboth in the iris and the white--the temper partakes also. Nothing that\r\nhappens--no event, rencontre, weather, &c--but it is confronted--nothing\r\nbut is subdued into sustenance--such is the marvellous transformation\r\nfrom the old timorousness and the old process of causes and effects.\r\nSorrows and disappointments cease--there is no more borrowing trouble\r\nin advance. A man realizes the venerable myth--he is a god walking the\r\nearth, he sees new eligibilities, powers and beauties everywhere; he\r\nhimself has a new eyesight and hearing. The play of the body in motion\r\ntakes a previously unknown grace. Merely _to move_ is then a\r\nhappiness, a pleasure--to breathe, to see, is also. All the beforehand\r\ngratifications, drink, spirits, coffee, grease, stimulants, mixtures,\r\nlate hours, luxuries, deeds of the night, seem as vexatious dreams, and\r\nnow the awakening;--many fall into their natural places, whole-some,\r\nconveying diviner joys.\r\n\r\nWhat I append--Health, old style--I have long treasur'd--found\r\noriginally in some scrap-book fifty years ago--a favorite of mine (but\r\nquite a glaring contrast to my present bodily state:)\r\n\r\n    On a high rock above the vast abyss,\r\n      Whose solid base tumultuous waters lave;\r\n    Whose airy high-top balmy breezes kiss,\r\n      Fresh from the white foam of the circling wave--\r\n\r\n    There ruddy HEALTH, in rude majestic state,\r\n      His clust'ring forelock combatting the winds--\r\n    Bares to each season's change his breast elate,\r\n      And still fresh vigor from th' encounter finds;\r\n\r\n    With mighty mind to every fortune braced,\r\n      To every climate each corporeal power,\r\n    And high-proof heart, impenetrably cased,\r\n      He mocks the quick transitions of the hour.\r\n\r\n    Now could he hug bleak Zembla's bolted snow,\r\n      Now to Arabia's heated deserts turn,\r\n    Yet bids the biting blast more fiercely blow,\r\n      The scorching sun without abatement burn.\r\n\r\n    There this bold Outlaw, rising with the morn,\r\n      His sinewy functions fitted for the toil,\r\n    Pursues, with tireless steps, the rapturous horn,\r\n      And bears in triumph back the shaggy spoil.\r\n\r\n    Or, on his rugged range of towering hills,\r\n      Turns the stiff glebe behind his hardy team;\r\n    His wide-spread heaths to blithest measures tills,\r\n      And boasts the joys of life are not a dream!\r\n\r\n    Then to his airy hut, at eve, retires,\r\n      Clasps to his open breast his buxom spouse,\r\n    Basks in his faggot's blaze, his passions fires,\r\n      And strait supine to rest unbroken bows.\r\n\r\n    On his smooth forehead, Time's old annual score,\r\n      Tho' left to furrow, yet disdains to lie;\r\n    He bids weak sorrow tantalize no more,\r\n      And puts the cup of care contemptuous by.\r\n\r\n    If, from some inland height, that, skirting, bears\r\n      Its rude encroachments far into the vale,\r\n    He views where poor dishonor'd nature wears\r\n      On her soft cheek alone the lily pale;\r\n\r\n    How will he scorn alliance with the race,\r\n      Those aspen shoots that shiver at a breath;\r\n    Children of sloth, that danger dare not face,\r\n      And find in life but an extended death:\r\n\r\n    Then from the silken reptiles will he fly,\r\n      To the bold cliff in bounding transports run,\r\n    And stretch'd o'er many a wave his ardent eye,\r\n      Embrace the enduring Sea-Boy as his son!\r\n\r\n    Yes! thine alone--from pain, from sorrow free,\r\n      The lengthen'd life with peerless joys replete;\r\n    Then let me, Lord of Mountains, share with thee\r\n      The hard, the early toil--the relaxation sweet.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAY-HEARTEDNESS\r\n\r\nWalking on the old Navy Yard bridge, Washington, D. C., once with a\r\ncompanion, Mr. Marshall, from England, a great traveler and observer, as\r\na squad of laughing young black girls pass'd us--then two copper-color'd\r\nboys, one good-looking lad 15 or 16, barefoot, running after--\"What _gay\r\ncreatures_ they all appear to be,\" said Mr. M. Then we fell to talking\r\nabout the general lack of buoyant animal spirits. \"I think,\" said Mr.\r\nM., \"that in all my travels, and all my intercourse with people of\r\nevery and any class, especially the cultivated ones, (the literary and\r\nfashionable folks,) I have never yet come across what I should call a\r\nreally GAY-HEARTED MAN.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a terrible criticism--cut into me like a surgeon's lance. Made me\r\nsilent the whole walk home.\r\n\r\n\r\nAS IN A SWOON.\r\n\r\n    As in a swoon, one instant,\r\n    Another sun, ineffable, full-dazzles me,\r\n    And all the orbs I knew--and brighter, unknown orbs;\r\n    One instant of the future land, Heaven's land.\r\n\r\n\r\nL. OF G.\r\n\r\n    Thoughts, suggestions, aspirations, pictures,\r\n    Cities and farms--by day and night--book of peace and war,\r\n    Of platitudes and of the commonplace.\r\n\r\n    For out-door health, the land and sea--for good will,\r\n    For America--for all the earth, all nations, the common people,\r\n    (Not of one nation only--not America only.)\r\n\r\n    In it each claim, ideal, line, by all lines, claims, ideals,\r\n      temper'd;\r\n    Each right and wish by other wishes, rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER THE ARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n    A group of little children with their ways and chatter flow in,\r\n    Like welcome rippling water o'er my heated nerves and flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR US TWO, READER DEAR.\r\n\r\n    Simple, spontaneous, curious, two souls interchanging,\r\n    With the original testimony for us continued to the last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORANDA\r\n\r\n\r\n[Let me indeed turn upon myself a little of the light I have been so\r\nfond of casting on others.\r\n\r\nOf course these few exceptional later mems are far, far short of one's\r\nconcluding history or thoughts or life-giving--only a hap-hazard pinch\r\nof all. But the old Greek proverb put it, \"Anybody who really has a good\r\nquality\" (or bad one either, I guess) \"has _all_.\" There's something in\r\nthe proverb; but you mustn't carry it too far.\r\n\r\nI will not reject any theme or subject because the treatment is too\r\npersonal.\r\n\r\nAs my stuff settles into shape, I am told (and sometimes myself\r\ndiscover, uneasily, but feel all right about it in calmer moments) it\r\nis mainly autobiographic, and even egotistic after all--which I finally\r\naccept, and am contented so.\r\n\r\nIf this little volume betrays, as it doubtless does, a weakening\r\nhand, and decrepitude, remember it is knit together out of accumulated\r\nsickness, inertia, physical disablement, acute pain, and listlessness.\r\nMy fear will be that at last my pieces show indooredness, and being\r\nchain'd to a chair--as never before. Only the resolve to keep up, and\r\non, and to add a remnant, and even perhaps obstinately see what failing\r\npowers and decay may contribute too, have produced it.\r\n\r\nAnd now as from some fisherman's net hauling all sorts, and disbursing\r\nthe same.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA WORLD'S SHOW\r\n\r\n_New York, Great Exposition open'd in 1853._--I went a long time (nearly\r\na year)--days and nights--especially the latter--as it was finely\r\nlighted, and had a very large and copious exhibition gallery of\r\npaintings (shown at best at night, I tho't)--hundreds of pictures from\r\nEurope, many masterpieces--all an exhaustless study--and, scatter'd\r\nthro' the building, sculptures, single figures or groups--among the\r\nrest, Thorwaldsen's \"Apostles,\" colossal in size--and very many fine\r\nbronzes, pieces of plate from English silversmiths, and curios from\r\neverywhere abroad--with woods from all lands of the earth--all sorts of\r\nfabrics and products and handiwork from the workers of all nations.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK--THE BAY--THE OLD NAME\r\n\r\n_Commencement of a gossipy travelling letter in a New York city paper,\r\nMay 10, 1879_.--My month's visit is about up; but before I get back to\r\nCamden let me print some jottings of the last four weeks. Have you not,\r\nreader dear, among your intimate friends, some one, temporarily absent,\r\nwhose letters to you, avoiding all the big topics and disquisitions,\r\ngive only minor, gossipy sights and scenes--just as they come--subjects\r\ndisdain'd by solid writers, but interesting to you because they were\r\nsuch as happen to everybody, and were the moving entourage to your\r\nfriend--to his or her steps, eyes, mentality? Well, with an idea\r\nsomething of that kind, I suppose, I set out on the following\r\nhurrygraphs of a breezy early-summer visit to New York city and up the\r\nNorth river--especially at present of some hours along Broadway.\r\n\r\n_What I came to New York for_.--To try the experiment of a lecture--to\r\nsee whether I could stand it, and whether an audience could--was my\r\nspecific object. Some friends had invited me--it was by no means clear\r\nhow it would end--I stipulated that they should get only a third-rate\r\nhall, and not sound the advertising trumpets a bit--and so I started. I\r\nmuch wanted something to do for occupation, consistent with my limping\r\nand paralyzed state. And now, since it came off, and since neither my\r\nhearers nor I myself really collaps'd at the aforesaid lecture, I intend\r\nto go up and down the land (in moderation,) seeking whom I may devour,\r\nwith lectures, and reading of my own poems--short pulls, however--never\r\nexceeding an hour.\r\n\r\n_Crossing from Jersey city, 5 to 6 P.M._--The city part of the North\r\nriver with its life, breadth, peculiarities--the amplitude of sea and\r\nwharf, cargo and commerce--one don't realize them till one has been\r\naway a long time and, as now returning, (crossing from Jersey city to\r\nDesbrosses-st.,) gazes on the unrivall'd panorama, and far down the\r\nthin-vapor'd vistas of the bay, toward the Narrows--or northward up the\r\nHudson--or on the ample spread and infinite variety, free and floating,\r\nof the more immediate views--a countless river series--everything\r\nmoving, yet so easy, and such plenty of room! Little, I say, do folks\r\nhere appreciate the most ample, eligible, picturesque bay and estuary\r\nsurroundings in the world! This is the third time such a conviction\r\nhas come to me after absence, returning to New York, dwelling on its\r\nmagnificent entrances--approaching the city by them from any point.\r\n\r\nMore and more, too, the _old name_ absorbs into me--MANNAHATTA, \"the\r\nplace encircled by many swift tides and sparkling waters.\" How fit a\r\nname for America's great democratic island city! The word itself,\r\nhow beautiful! how aboriginal! how it seems to rise with tall spires,\r\nglistening in sunshine, with such New World atmosphere, vista and\r\naction!\r\n\r\n\r\nA SICK SPELL\r\n\r\n_Christmas Day, 25th Dec., 1888_.--Am somewhat easier and freer to-day\r\nand the last three days--sit up most of the time--read and write, and\r\nreceive my visitors. Have now been in-doors sick for seven months--half\r\nof the time bad, bad, vertigo, indigestion, bladder, gastric, head\r\ntrouble, inertia--Dr. Bucke, Dr. Osler, Drs. Wharton and Walsh--now\r\nEdward Wilkins my help and nurse. A fine, splendid, sunny day. My\r\n\"November Boughs\" is printed and out; and my \"Complete Works, Poems and\r\nProse,\" a big volume, 900 pages, also. It is ab't noon, and I sit here\r\npretty comfortable.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BE PRESENT ONLY\r\n\r\n_At the Complimentary Dinner, Camden, New Jersey, May 31, 1889_.--Walt\r\nWhitman said: My friends, though announced to give an address, there\r\nis no such intention. Following the impulse of the spirit, (for I am at\r\nleast half of Quaker stock) I have obey'd the command to come and look\r\nat you, for a minute, and show myself, face to face; which is probably\r\nthe best I can do. But I have felt no command to make a speech;\r\nand shall not therefore attempt any. All I have felt the imperative\r\nconviction to say I have already printed in my books of poems or prose;\r\nto which I refer any who may be curious. And so, hail and farewell.\r\nDeeply acknowledging this deep compliment, with my best respects and\r\nlove to you personally--to Camden--to New-Jersey, and to all represented\r\nhere--you must excuse me from any word further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"INTESTINAL AGITATION\"\r\n\r\n_From Pall-Mall Gazette, London, England, Feb 8, 1890_ Mr. Ernest\r\nRhys has just receiv'd an interesting letter from Walt Whitman, dated\r\n\"Camden, January 22, 1890.\" The following is an extract from it:\r\n\r\nI am still here--no very mark'd or significant change or\r\nhappening--fairly buoyant spirits, &c.--but surely, slowly ebbing. At\r\nthis moment sitting here, in my den, Mickle street, by the oakwood fire,\r\nin the same big strong old chair with wolf-skin spread over back--bright\r\nsun, cold, dry winter day. America continues--is generally busy enough\r\nall over her vast demesnes (intestinal agitation I call it,) talking,\r\nplodding, making money, every one trying to get on--perhaps to get\r\ntowards the top--but no special individual signalism--(just as well, I\r\nguess.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\"WALT WHITMAN'S LAST 'PUBLIC'\"\r\n\r\nThe gay and crowded audience at the Art Rooms, Philadelphia, Tuesday\r\nnight, April 15, 1890, says a correspondent of the Boston _Transcript_,\r\nApril 19, might not have thought that W. W. crawl'd out of a sick bed a\r\nfew hours before, crying,\r\n\r\n    Dangers retreat when boldly they're confronted,\r\n\r\nand went over, hoarse and half blind, to deliver his memoranda and essay\r\non the death of Abraham Lincoln, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of that\r\ntragedy. He led off with the following new paragraph:\r\n\r\n\"Of Abraham Lincoln, bearing testimony twenty-five years after his\r\ndeath--and of that death--I am now my friends before you. Few realize\r\nthe days, the great historic and esthetic personalities, with him in\r\nthe centre, we pass'd through. Abraham Lincoln, familiar, our own, an\r\nIllinoisian, modern, yet tallying ancient Moses, Joshua, Ulysses, or\r\nlater Cromwell, and grander in some respects than any of them; Abraham\r\nLincoln, that makes the like of Homer, Plutarch, Shakspere, eligible our\r\nday or any day. My subject this evening for forty or fifty minutes' talk\r\nis the death of this man, and how that death will really filter into\r\nAmerica. I am not going to tell you anything new; and it is doubtless\r\nnearly altogether because I ardently wish to commemorate the hour and\r\nmartyrdom and name I am here. Oft as the rolling years bring back this\r\nhour, let it again, however briefly, be dwelt upon. For my own part I\r\nhope and intend till my own dying day, whenever the 14th and 15th\r\nof April comes, to annually gather a few friends and hold its tragic\r\nreminiscence. No narrow or sectional reminiscence. It belongs to these\r\nStates in their entirety--not the North only, but the South--perhaps\r\nbelongs most tenderly and devoutly to the South, of all; for there\r\nreally this man's birthstock; there and then his antecedent stamp. Why\r\nshould I not say that thence his manliest traits, his universality,\r\nhis canny, easy ways and words upon the surface--his inflexible\r\ndetermination at heart? Have you ever realized it, my friends, that\r\nLincoln, though grafted on the West, is essentially in personnel and\r\ncharacter a Southern contribution?\"\r\n\r\nThe most of the poet's address was devoted to the actual occurrences and\r\ndetails of the murder. We believe the delivery on Tuesday was Whitman's\r\nthirteenth of it. The old poet is now physically wreck'd. But his voice\r\nand magnetism are the same. For the last month he has been under\r\na severe attack of the lately prevailing influenza, the grip, in\r\naccumulation upon his previous ailments, and, above all, that terrible\r\nparalysis, the bequest of secession war times. He was dress'd last\r\nTuesday night in an entire suit of French Canadian grey wool cloth, with\r\nbroad shirt collar, with no necktie; long white hair, red face, full\r\nbeard and moustache, and look'd as though he might weigh two hundred\r\npounds. He had to be help'd and led every step. In five weeks more he\r\nwill begin his seventy-second year. He is still writing a little.\r\n\r\n\r\nINGERSOLL'S SPEECH\r\n\r\n_From the Camden Post, N.J., June 2, 1890_ _He attends and makes a\r\nspeech at the celebration of Walt Whitman's birthday_.--Walt Whitman\r\nis now in his seventy-second year. His younger friends, literary and\r\npersonal, men and women, gave him a complimentary supper last Saturday\r\nnight, to note the close of his seventy-first year, and the late curious\r\nand unquestionable \"boom\" of the old man's wide-spreading popularity,\r\nand that of his \"Leaves of Grass.\" There were thirty-five in the room,\r\nmostly young, but some old, or beginning to be. The great feature was\r\nIngersoll's utterance. It was probably, in its way, the most admirable\r\nspecimen of modern oratory hitherto delivered in the English language,\r\nimmense as such praise may sound. It was 40 to 50 minutes long,\r\naltogether without notes, in a good voice, low enough and not too low,\r\nstyle easy, rather colloquial (over and over again saying \"you\" to\r\nWhitman who sat opposite,) sometimes markedly impassion'd, once or\r\ntwice humorous--amid his whole speech, from interior fires and volition,\r\npulsating and swaying like a first-class Andalusian dancer.\r\n\r\nAnd such a critical dissection, and flattering summary! The Whitmanites\r\nfor the first time in their lives were fully satisfied; and that is\r\nsaying a good deal, for they have not put their claims low, by a long\r\nshot. Indeed it was a tremendous talk! Physically and mentally Ingersoll\r\n(he had been working all day in New York, talking in court and in his\r\noffice,) is now at his best, like mellow'd wine, or a just ripe\r\napple; to the artist-sense, too, looks at his best--not merely like a\r\nbequeath'd Roman bust or fine smooth marble Cicero-head, or even Greek\r\nPlato; for he is modern and vital and vein'd and American, and (far more\r\nthan the age knows,) justifies us all.\r\n\r\nWe cannot give a full report of this most remarkable talk and supper\r\n(which was curiously conversational and Greek-like) but must add the\r\nfollowing significant bit of it.\r\n\r\nAfter the speaking, and just before the close, Mr. Whitman reverted to\r\nColonel Ingersoll's tribute to his poems, pronouncing it the capsheaf\r\nof all commendation that he had ever receiv'd. Then, his mind still\r\ndwelling upon the Colonel's religious doubts, he went on to say that\r\nwhat he himself had in his mind when he wrote \"Leaves of Grass\" was not\r\nonly to depict American life, as it existed, and to show the triumphs of\r\nscience, and the poetry in common things, and the full of an individual\r\ndemocratic humanity, for the aggregate, but also to show that there\r\nwas behind all something which rounded and completed it. \"For what,\"\r\nhe ask'd, \"would this life be without immortality? It would be as a\r\nlocomotive, the greatest triumph of modern science, with no train to\r\ndraw after it. If the spiritual is not behind the material, to what\r\npurpose is the material? What is this world without a further Divine\r\npurpose in it all?\"\r\n\r\nColonel Ingersoll repeated his former argument in reply.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEELING FAIRLY\r\n\r\n_Friday, July 27, 1890_.--Feeling fairly these days, and even\r\njovial--sleep and appetite good enough to be thankful for--had a dish\r\nof Maryland blackberries, some good rye bread and a cup of tea, for\r\nmy breakfast--relish' d all--fine weather--bright sun to-day--pleasant\r\nnorthwest breeze blowing in the open window as I sit here in my big\r\nrattan chair--two great fine roses (white and red, blooming, fragrant,\r\nsent by mail by W. S. K. and wife, Mass.) are in a glass of water on the\r\ntable before me.\r\n\r\nAm now in my 72d year.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD BROOKLYN DAYS\r\n\r\nIt must have been in 1822 or '3 that I first came to live in Brooklyn.\r\nLived first in Front street, not far from what was then call'd \"the New\r\nFerry,\" wending the river from the foot of Catharine (or Main) street to\r\nNew York city.\r\n\r\nI was a little child (was born in 1819,) but tramp'd freely about the\r\nneighborhood and town, even then; was often on the aforesaid New\r\nFerry; remember how I was petted and deadheaded by the gatekeepers and\r\ndeckhands (all such fellows are kind to little children,) and remember\r\nthe horses that seem'd to me so queer as they trudg'd around in the\r\ncentral houses of the boats, making the water-power. (For it was just\r\non the eve of the steam-engine, which was soon after introduced on the\r\nferries.) Edward Copeland (afterward Mayor) had a grocery store then at\r\nthe corner of Front and Catharine streets.\r\n\r\nPresently we Whitmans all moved up to Tillary street, near Adams, where\r\nmy father, who was a carpenter, built a house for himself and us all. It\r\nwas from here I \"assisted\" the personal coming of Lafayette in 1824-'5\r\nto Brooklyn. He came over the Old Ferry, as the now Fulton Ferry (partly\r\nnavigated quite up to that day by \"horse boats,\" though the first\r\nsteamer had begun to be used hereabouts) was then call'd, and was\r\nreceiv'd at the foot of Fulton street. It was on that occasion that the\r\ncorner-stone of the Apprentices' Library, at the corner of Cranberry\r\nand Henry streets--since pull'd down--was laid by Lafayette's own hands.\r\nNumerous children arrived on the grounds, of whom I was one, and were\r\nassisted by several gentlemen to safe spots to view the ceremony. Among\r\nothers, Lafayette, also helping the children, took me up--I was five\r\nyears old, press'd me a moment to his breast--gave me a kiss and set me\r\ndown in a safe spot. Lafayette was at that time between sixty-five and\r\nseventy years of age, with a manly figure and a kind face.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nAn editor of (or in) a leading monthly magazine (\"Harper's Monthly,\"\r\nJuly, 1890,) asks: \"A hundred years from now will W.W. be popularly\r\nrated a great poet--or will he be forgotten?\" ... A mighty ticklish\r\nquestion--which can only be left for a hundred years hence--perhaps more\r\nthan that. But whether W.W. has been mainly rejected by his own times is\r\nan easier question to answer.\r\n\r\nAll along from 1860 to '91, many of the pieces in L. of G., and its\r\nannexes, were first sent to publishers or magazine editors before being\r\nprinted in the L., and were peremptorily rejected by them, and sent back\r\nto their author. The \"Eidólons\" was sent back by Dr. H., of \"Scribner's\r\nMonthly\" with a lengthy, very insulting and contemptuous letter. \"To\r\nthe Sun-Set Breeze,\" was rejected by the editor of \"Harper's Monthly\" as\r\nbeing \"an improvisation\" only. \"On, on ye jocund twain\" was rejected\r\nby the \"Century\" editor as being personal merely. Several of the pieces\r\nwent the rounds of all the monthlies, to be thus summarily rejected.\r\n\r\n_June, '90_.--The----rejects and sends back my little poem, so I am now\r\nset out in the cold by every big magazine and publisher, and may as well\r\nunderstand and admit it--which is just as well, for I find I am palpably\r\nlosing my sight and ratiocination.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n_To a volume of essays and tales by Wm. D. O'Connor, pub'd posthumously\r\nin 1891_\r\n\r\nA hasty memorandum, not particularly for Preface to the following tales,\r\nbut to put on record my respect and affection for as sane, beautiful,\r\ncute, tolerant, loving, candid and free and fair-intention'd a nature as\r\never vivified our race.\r\n\r\nIn Boston, 1860, I first met William Douglas O'Connor.[48] As I saw\r\nand knew him then, in his 29th year, and for twenty-five further\r\nyears along, he was a gallant, handsome, gay-hearted, fine-voiced,\r\nglowing-eyed man; lithe-moving on his feet, of healthy and magnetic\r\natmosphere and presence, and the most welcome company in the world.\r\nHe was a thorough-going anti-slavery believer, speaker and writer,\r\n(doctrinaire,) and though I took a fancy to him from the first. I\r\nremember I fear'd his ardent abolitionism--was afraid it would probably\r\nkeep us apart. (I was a decided and out-spoken anti-slavery believer\r\nmyself, then and always; but shy'd from the extremists, the red-hot\r\nfellows of those times.) O'C. was then correcting the proofs of\r\n_Harrington_, an eloquent and fiery novel he had written, and which\r\nwas printed just before the commencement of the secession war. He\r\nwas already married, the father of two fine little children, and was\r\npersonally and intellectually the most attractive man I had ever met.\r\n\r\nLast of '62 I found myself led towards the war-field--went to Washington\r\ncity--(to become absorb'd in the armies, and in the big hospitals, and\r\nto get work in one of the Departments,)--and there I met and resumed\r\nfriendship, and found warm hospitality from O'C. and his noble New\r\nEngland wife. They had just lost by death their little child-boy,\r\nPhillip; and O'C. was yet feeling serious about it. The youngster had\r\nbeen vaccinated against the threatening of small-pox which alarm'd the\r\ncity; but somehow it led to worse results than it was intended to ward\r\noff--or at any rate O'C. thought that proved the cause of the boy's\r\ndeath. He had one child left, a fine bright little daughter, and a great\r\ncomfort to her parents. (Dear Jeannie! She grew up a most accomplish'd\r\nand superior young woman--declined in health, and died about 1881.)\r\n\r\nOn through for months and years to '73 I saw and talk'd with O'C. almost\r\ndaily. I had soon got employment, first for a short time in the Indian\r\nBureau (in the Interior Department,) and then for a long while in the\r\nAttorney General's Office. The secession war, with its tide of varying\r\nfortunes, excitements--President Lincoln and the daily sight of him--the\r\ndoings in Congress and at the State Capitols--the news from the fields\r\nand campaigns, and from foreign governments--my visits to the Army\r\nHospitals, daily and nightly, soon absorbing everything else,--with a\r\nhundred matters, occurrences, personalties,--(Greeley, Wendell Phillips,\r\nthe parties, the Abolitionists, &c.)--were the subjects of our talk and\r\ndiscussion. I am not sure from what I heard then, but O'C. was cut out\r\nfor a first-class public speaker or forensic advocate. No audience\r\nor jury could have stood out against him. He had a strange charm of\r\nphysiologic voice. He had a power and sharp-cut faculty of statement and\r\npersuasiveness beyond any man's else. I know it well, for I have felt\r\nit many a time. If not as orator, his forte was as critic, newer, deeper\r\nthan any: also, as literary author. One of his traits was that while he\r\nknew all, and welcom'd all sorts of great _genre_ literature, all lands\r\nand times, from all writers and artists, and not only tolerated\r\neach, and defended every attack'd literary person with a skill or\r\nheart-catholicism that I never saw equal'd--invariably advocated and\r\nexcused them--he kept an idiosyncrasy and identity of his own very\r\nmark'd, and without special tinge or undue color from any source. He\r\nalways applauded the freedom of the masters, whence and whoever. I\r\nremember his special defences of Byron, Burns, Poe, Rabelais, Victor\r\nHugo, George Sand, and others. There was always a little touch of\r\npensive cadence in his superb voice; and I think there was something\r\nof the same sadness in his temperament and nature. Perhaps, too, in\r\nhis literary structure. But he was a very buoyant, jovial, good-natured\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nSo much for a hasty melanged reminiscence and note of William O'Connor,\r\nmy dear, dear friend, and staunch, (probably my staunchest) literary\r\nbeliever and champion from the first, and throughout without halt or\r\ndemur, for twenty-five years. No better friend--none more reliable\r\nthrough this life of one's ups and downs. On the occurrence of the\r\nlatter he would be sure to make his appearance on the scene, eager,\r\nhopeful, full of fight like a perfect knight of chivalry. For he was a\r\nborn sample here in the 19th century of the flower and symbol of olden\r\ntime first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his memory! W. W.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: [48] Born Jan. 2d, 1832. When grown, lived several years in\r\nBoston, and edited journals and magazines there--went about 1861 to\r\nWashington, D. C., and became a U.S. clerk, first in the Light-House\r\nBureau, and then in the U.S. Life-Saving Service, in which branch he was\r\nAssistant Superintendent for many years--sicken'd in 1887--died there at\r\nWashington, May 9th, 1889.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ENGINEER'S OBITUARY\r\n\r\n_From the Engineering Record, New York, Dec. 13, 1890_\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson Whitman was born July 18, 1833, in Brooklyn, N. Y.,\r\nfrom a father of English Stock, and mother (Louisa Van Velsor) descended\r\nfrom Dutch (Holland) immigration. His early years were spent on Long\r\nIsland, either in the country or Brooklyn. As a lad he show'd a tendency\r\nfor surveying and civil engineering, and about at 19 went with Chief\r\nKirkwood, who was then prospecting and outlining for the great city\r\nwater-works. He remain'd at that construction throughout, was a favorite\r\nand confidant of the Chief, and was successively promoted. He continued\r\nalso under Chief Moses Lane. He married in 1859, and not long after was\r\ninvited by the Board of Public Works of St. Louis, Missouri, to come\r\nthere and plan and build a new and fitting water-works for that great\r\ncity. Whitman accepted the call, and moved and settled there, and had\r\nbeen a resident of St. Louis ever since. He plann'd and built the works,\r\nwhich were very successful, and remain'd as super-intendent and chief\r\nfor nearly 20 years.\r\n\r\nOf the last six years he has been largely occupied as consulting\r\nengineer (divested of his cares and position in St. Louis,) and\r\nhas engaged in public constructions, bridges, sewers, &c., West and\r\nSouthwest, and especially the Memphis, Tenn., city water-works.\r\n\r\nThomas J. Whitman was a theoretical and practical mechanic of superior\r\norder, founded in the soundest personal and professional integrity. He\r\nwas a great favorite among the young engineers and students; not a few\r\nof them yet remaining in Kings and Queens counties, and New York city,\r\nwill remember \"Jeff,\" with old-time good-will and affection. He was\r\nmostly self-taught, and was a hard student.\r\n\r\nHe had been troubled of late years from a bad throat and from gastric\r\naffection, tending on typhoid, and had been rather seriously ill with\r\nthe last malady, but was getting over the worst of it, when he succumb'd\r\nunder a sudden and severe attack of the heart. He died at St. Louis,\r\nNovember 25, 1890, in his 58th year. Of his family, the wife died in\r\n1873, and a daughter, Mannahatta, died two years ago. Another daughter,\r\nJessie Louisa, the only child left, is now living in St. Louis.\r\n\r\n[When Jeff was born I was in my 15th year, and had much care of him for\r\nmany years afterward, and he did not separate from me. He was a very\r\nhandsome, healthy, affectionate, smart child, and would sit on my lap\r\nor hang on my neck half an hour at a time. As he grew a big boy he liked\r\noutdoor and water sports, especially boating. We would often go down\r\nsummers to Peconic Bay, east end of Long Island, and over to Shelter\r\nIsland. I loved long rambles, and he carried his fowling-piece. O,\r\nwhat happy times, weeks! Then in Brooklyn and New York city he learn'd\r\nprinting, and work'd awhile at it; but eventually (with my approval) he\r\nwent to employment at land surveying, and merged in the studies and work\r\nof topographical engineer; this satisfied him, and he continued at it.\r\nHe was of noble nature from the first; very good-natured, very plain,\r\nvery friendly. O, how we loved each other--how many jovial good times we\r\nhad! Once we made a long trip from New York city down over the Allegheny\r\nmountains (the National Road) and via the Ohio and Mississippi rivers,\r\nfrom Cairo to New Orleans.]\r\n\r\nGod's blessing on your name and memory, dear brother Jeff!\r\n\r\nW. W.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD ACTORS, SINGERS, SHOWS, &C., IN NEW YORK\r\n\r\n_Flitting mention--(with much left out)_\r\n\r\nSeems to me I ought acknowledge my debt to actors, singers, public\r\nspeakers, conventions, and the Stage in New York, my youthful days,\r\nfrom 1835 onward--say to '60 or '61--and to plays and operas generally.\r\n(Which nudges a pretty big disquisition: of course it should be all\r\nelaborated and penetrated more deeply--but I will here give only some\r\nflitting mentionings of my youth.) Seems to me now when I look back, the\r\nItalian contralto Marietta Alboni (she is living yet, in Paris, 1891,\r\nin good condition, good voice yet, considering) with the then prominent\r\nhistrions Booth, Edwin Forrest, and Fanny Kemble and the Italian singer\r\nBettini, have had the deepest and most lasting effect upon me. I should\r\nlike well if Madame Alboni and the old composer Verdi, (and Bettini the\r\ntenor, if he is living) could know how much noble pleasure and happiness\r\nthey gave me, and how deeply I always remember them and thank them\r\nto this day. For theatricals in literature and doubtless upon me\r\npersonally, including opera, have been of course serious factors. (The\r\nexperts and musicians of my present friends claim that the new Wagner\r\nand his pieces belong far more truly to me, and I to them, likely. But\r\nI was fed and bred under the Italian dispensation, and absorb'd it, and\r\ndoubtless show it.)\r\n\r\nAs a young fellow, when possible I always studied a play or libretto\r\nquite carefully over, by myself, (sometimes twice through) before\r\nseeing it on the stage; read it the day or two days before. Tried both\r\nways--not reading some beforehand; but I found I gain'd most by getting\r\nthat sort of mastery first, if the piece had depth. (Surface effects and\r\nglitter were much less thought of, I am sure, those times.) There were\r\nmany fine old plays, neither tragedies nor comedies--the names of them\r\nquite unknown to to-day's current audiences. \"All is not Gold that\r\nGlitters,\" in which Charlotte Cushman had a superbly enacted part, was\r\nof that kind. C. C., who revel'd in them, was great in such pieces; I\r\nthink better than in the heavy popular rôles.\r\n\r\nWe had some fine music those days. We had the English opera of\r\n\"Cinderella\" (with Henry Placide as the pompous old father, an\r\nunsurpassable bit of comedy and music.) We had Bombastes Furioso.\r\nMust have been in 1844 (or '5) I saw Charles Kean and Mrs. Kean (Ellen\r\nTree)--saw them in the Park in Shakspere's \"King John.\" He, of course,\r\nwas the chief character. She play'd _Queen Constance._ Tom Hamblin was\r\n_Faulconbridge,_ and probably the best ever on the stage. It was an\r\nimmense show-piece, too; lots of grand set scenes and fine armor-suits\r\nand all kinds of appointments imported from London (where it had been\r\nfirst render'd.) The large brass bands--the three or four hundred\r\n\"supes\"--the interviews between the French and English armies--the\r\ntalk with _Hubert_ (and the hot irons) the delicious acting of _Prince\r\nArthur_ (Mrs. Richardson, I think)--and all the fine blare and court\r\npomp--I remember to this hour. The death-scene of the King in the\r\norchard of Swinstead Abbey, was very effective. Kean rush'd in,\r\ngray-pale and yellow, and threw himself on a lounge in the open. His\r\npangs were horribly realistic. (He must have taken lessons in some\r\nhospital.)\r\n\r\nFanny Kemble play'd to wonderful effect in such pieces as \"Fazio, or the\r\nItalian wife.\" The turning-point was jealousy. It was a rapid-running,\r\nyet heavy-timber'd, tremendous wrenching, passionate play. Such old\r\npieces always seem'd to me built like an ancient ship of the line, solid\r\nand lock'd from keel up--oak and metal and knots. One of the finest\r\ncharacters was a great court lady, _Aldabella_, enacted by Mrs. Sharpe.\r\nO how it all entranced us, and knock'd us about, as the scenes swept on\r\nlike a cyclone!\r\n\r\nSaw Hackett at the old Park many times, and remember him well. His\r\nrenderings were first-rate in everything. He inaugurated the true \"Rip\r\nVan Winkle,\" and look'd and acted and dialogued it to perfection (he was\r\nof Dutch breed, and brought up among old Holland descendants in Kings\r\nand Queens counties, Long Island.) The play and the acting of it have\r\nbeen adjusted to please popular audiences since; but there was in that\r\noriginal performance certainly something of a far higher order, more\r\nart, more reality, more resemblance, a bit of fine pathos, a lofty\r\n_brogue_, beyond anything afterward.\r\n\r\nOne of my big treats was the rendering at the old Park of Shakspere's\r\n\"Tempest\" in musical version. There was a very fine instrumental band,\r\nnot numerous, but with a capital leader. Mrs. Austin was the _Ariel_,\r\nand Peter Richings the _Caliban_; both excellent. The drunken song of\r\nthe latter has probably been never equal'd. The perfect actor Clarke\r\n(old Clarke) was _Prospero_.\r\n\r\nYes; there were in New York and Brooklyn some fine non-technical singing\r\nperformances, concerts, such as the Hutchinson band, three brothers, and\r\nthe sister, the red-cheek'd New England carnation, sweet Abby; sometimes\r\nplaintive and balladic--sometimes anti-slavery, anti-calomel, and comic.\r\nThere were concerts by Templeton, Russell, Dempster, the old Alleghanian\r\nband, and many others. Then we had lots of \"negro minstrels,\" with\r\ncapital character songs and voices. I often saw Rice the original \"Jim\r\nCrow\" at the old Park Theatre filling up the gap in some short bill--and\r\nthe wild chants and dances were admirable--probably ahead of anything\r\nsince. Every theatre had some superior voice, and it was common to\r\ngive a favorite song between the acts. \"The Sea\" at the bijou Olympic,\r\n(Broadway near Grand,) was always welcome from a little Englishman named\r\nEdwin, a good balladist. At the Bowery the loves of \"Sweet William,\"\r\n\r\n    \"When on the Downs the fleet was moor'd,\"\r\n\r\nalways bro't an encore, and sometimes a treble.\r\n\r\nI remember Jenny Lind and heard her (1850 I think) several times.\r\nShe had the most brilliant, captivating, popular musical style and\r\nexpression of any one known; (the canary, and several other sweet\r\nbirds are wondrous fine--but there is something in song that goes\r\ndeeper--isn't there?)\r\n\r\nThe great \"Egyptian Collection\" was well up in Broadway, and I got quite\r\nacquainted with Dr. Abbott, the proprietor--paid many visits there, and\r\nhad long talks with him, in connection with my readings of many books\r\nand reports on Egypt--its antiquities, history, and how things and the\r\nscenes really look, and what the old relics stand for, as near as we can\r\nnow get. (Dr. A. was an Englishman of say 54--had been settled in\r\nCairo as physician for 25 years, and all that time was collecting these\r\nrelics, and sparing no time or money seeking and getting them. By advice\r\nand for a change of base for himself, he brought the collection to\r\nAmerica. But the whole enterprise was a fearful disappointment, in the\r\npay and commercial part.) As said, I went to the Egyptian Museum many\r\nmany times; sometimes had it all to myself--delved at the formidable\r\ncatalogue--and on several occasions had the invaluable personal talk,\r\ncorrection, illustration and guidance of Dr. A. himself. He was very\r\nkind and helpful to me in those studies and examinations; once, by\r\nappointment, he appear'd in full and exact Turkish (Cairo) costume,\r\nwhich long usage there had made habitual to him.\r\n\r\nOne of the choice places of New York to me then was the \"Phrenological\r\nCabinet\" of Fowler & Wells, Nassau street near Beekman. Here were all\r\nthe busts, examples, curios and books of that study obtainable. I went\r\nthere often, and once for myself had a very elaborate and leisurely\r\nexamination and \"chart of bumps\" written out (I have it yet,) by Nelson\r\nFowler (or was it Sizer?) there.\r\n\r\nAnd who remembers the renown'd New York \"Tabernacle\" of those days\r\n\"before the war\"? It was on the east side of Broadway, near Pearl\r\nstreet--was a great turtle-shaped hall, and you had to walk back from\r\nthe street entrance thro' a long wide corridor to get to it--was very\r\nstrong--had an immense gallery--altogether held three or four thousand\r\npeople. Here the huge annual conventions of the windy and cyclonic\r\n\"reformatory societies\" of those times were held--especially the\r\ntumultuous Anti-Slavery ones. I remember hearing Wendell Phillips,\r\nEmerson, Cassius Clay, John P. Hale, Beecher, Fred Douglas, the\r\nBurleighs, Garrison, and others. Sometimes the Hutchinsons would\r\nsing--very fine. Sometimes there were angry rows. A chap named Isaiah\r\nRhynders, a fierce politician of those days, with a band of robust\r\nsupporters, would attempt to contradict the speakers and break up\r\nthe meetings. But the Anti-Slavery, and Quaker, and Temperance, and\r\nMissionary and other conventicles and speakers were tough, tough, and\r\nalways maintained their ground, and carried out their programs fully.\r\nI went frequently to these meetings, May after May--learn'd much from\r\nthem--was sure to be on hand when J. P. Hale or Cash Clay made speeches.\r\n\r\nThere were also the smaller and handsome halls of the Historical and\r\nAthensum Societies up on Broadway. I very well remember W.C. Bryant\r\nlecturing on Homoeopathy in one of them, and attending two or three\r\naddresses by R.W. Emerson in the other.\r\n\r\nThere was a series of plays and dramatic _genre_ characters by a\r\ngentleman bill'd as Ranger--very fine, better than merely technical,\r\nfull of exquisite shades, like the light touches of the violin in the\r\nhands of a master. There was the actor Anderson, who brought us Gerald\r\nGriffin's \"Gysippus,\" and play'd it to admiration. Among the actors of\r\nthose times I recall: Cooper, Wallack, Tom Hamblin, Adams (several), Old\r\nGates, Scott, Wm. Sefton, John Sefton, Geo. Jones, Mitchell, Seguin,\r\nOld Clarke, Richings, Fisher, H. Placide, T. Placide, Thorne, Ingersoll,\r\nGale (Mazeppa) Edwin, Horncastle. Some of the women hastily remember'd\r\nwere: Mrs. Vernon, Mrs. Pritchard, Mrs. McClure, Mary Taylor, Clara\r\nFisher, Mrs. Richardson, Mrs. Flynn. Then the singers, English, Italian\r\nand other: Mrs. Wood, Mrs. Seguin, Mrs. Austin, Grisi, La Grange,\r\nSteffanone, Bosio, Truffi, Parodi, Vestvali, Bertucca, Jenny Lind,\r\nGazzaniga, Laborde. And the opera men: Bettini, Badiali, Marini, Mario,\r\nBrignoli, Amodio, Beneventano, and many, many others whose names I do\r\nnot at this moment recall.\r\n\r\nIn another paper I have described the elder Booth, and the Bowery\r\nTheatre of those times. Afterward there was the Chatham. The elder\r\nThorne, Mrs. Thorne, William and John Sefton, Kirby, Brougham, and\r\nsometimes Edwin Forrest himself play'd there. I remember them all, and\r\nmany more, and especially the fine theatre on Broadway near Pearl, in\r\n1855 and '6.\r\n\r\nThere were very good circus performances, or horsemanship, in New York\r\nand Brooklyn. Every winter in the first-named city, a regular place\r\nin the Bowery, nearly opposite the old theatre; fine animals and fine\r\nriding, which I often witness'd. (Remember seeing near here, a young,\r\nfierce, splendid lion, presented by an African Barbary Sultan to\r\nPresident Andrew Jackson. The gift comprised also a lot of jewels, a\r\nfine steel sword, and an Arab stallion; and the lion was made over to a\r\nshow-man.)\r\n\r\nIf it is worth while I might add that there was a small but\r\nwell-appointed amateur-theatre up Broadway, with the usual stage,\r\norchestra, pit, boxes, &c., and that I was myself a member for some\r\ntime, and acted parts in it several times--\"second parts\" as they were\r\ncall'd. Perhaps it too was a lesson, or help'd that way; at any rate it\r\nwas full of fun and enjoyment.\r\n\r\nAnd so let us turn off the gas. Out in the brilliancy of the\r\nfoot-lights--filling the attention of perhaps a crowded audience, and\r\nmaking many a breath and pulse swell and rise--O so much passion and\r\nimparted life!--over and over again, the season through--walking,\r\ngesticulating, singing, reciting his or her part--But then sooner or\r\nlater inevitably wending to the flies or exit door--vanishing to sight\r\nand ear--and never materializing on this earth's stage again!\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME PERSONAL AND OLD-AGE JOTTINGS\r\n\r\nAnything like unmitigated acceptance of my \"Leaves of Grass\" book, and\r\nheart-felt response to it, in a popular however faint degree, bubbled\r\nforth as a fresh spring from the ground in England in 1876. The time was\r\na critical and turning point in my personal and literary life. Let me\r\nrevert to my memorandum book, Camden, New Jersey, that year, fill'd with\r\naddresses, receipts, purchases, &c., of the two volumes pub'd then by\r\nmyself--the \"Leaves,\" and the \"Two Rivulets\"--some home customers, for\r\nthem, but mostly from the British Islands. I was seriously paralyzed\r\nfrom the Secession war, poor, in debt, was expecting death, (the doctors\r\nput four chances out of five against me,)--and I had the books printed\r\nduring the lingering interim to occupy the tediousness of glum days and\r\nnights. Curiously, the sale abroad proved prompt, and what one might\r\ncall copious: the names came in lists and the money with them, by\r\nforeign mail. The price was $10 a set. Both the cash and the emotional\r\ncheer were deep medicines; many paid double or treble price, (Tennyson\r\nand Ruskin did,) and many sent kind and eulogistic letters; ladies,\r\nclergymen, social leaders, persons of rank, and high officials. Those\r\nblessed gales from the British Islands probably (certainly) saved me.\r\nHere are some of the names, for I w'd like to preserve them: Wm. M.\r\nand D.G. Rossetti, Lord Houghton, Edwd. Dowden, Mrs. Anne Gilchrist,\r\nKeningale Cook, Edwd. Carpenter, Therese Simpson, Rob't Buchanan, Alfred\r\nTennyson, John Ruskin, C.G. Gates, E.T. Wilkinson, T.L. Warren, C.W.\r\nReynell, W.B. Scott, A.G. Dew Smith, E.W. Gosse, T.W. Rolleston, Geo.\r\nWallis, Rafe Leicester, Thos. Dixon, N. MacColl, Mrs. Matthews, R.\r\nHannah, Geo. Saintsbury, R.S. Watson, Godfrey and Vernon Lushington,\r\nG.H. Lewes, G.H. Boughton, Geo. Fraser, W.T. Arnold, A. Ireland, Mrs. M.\r\nTaylor, M.D. Conway, Benj. Eyre, E. Dannreather, Rev. T.E. Brown, C.W.\r\nSheppard, E.J.A. Balfour, P.B. Marston, A.C. De Burgh, J.H. McCarthy,\r\nJ.H. Ingram, Rev. R.P. Graves, Lady Mount-temple, F.S. Ellis, W.\r\nBrockie, Rev. A.B. Grosart, Lady Hardy, Hubert Herkomer, Francis\r\nHueffer, H.G. Dakyns, R.L. Nettleship, W.J. Stillman, Miss Blind, Madox\r\nBrown, H.R. Ricardo, Messrs. O'Grady and Tyrrel; and many, many more.\r\n\r\nSeverely scann'd, it was perhaps no very great or vehement success; but\r\nthe tide had palpably shifted at any rate, and the sluices were turn'd\r\ninto my own veins and pockets. That emotional, audacious, open-handed,\r\nfriendly-mouth'd just-opportune English action, I say, pluck'd me like a\r\nbrand from the burning, and gave me life again, to finish my book, since\r\nab't completed. I do not forget it, and shall not; and if I ever have\r\na biographer I charge him to put it in the narrative. I have had the\r\nnoblest friends and backers in America; Wm. O'Connor, Dr. R.M. Bucke,\r\nJohn Burroughs, Geo.W. Childs, good ones in Boston, and Carnegie\r\nand R.G. Ingersoll in New York; and yet perhaps the tenderest and\r\ngratefulest breath of my heart has gone, and ever goes, over the\r\nsea-gales across the big pond.\r\n\r\nAbout myself at present. I will soon enter upon my 73d year, if I\r\nlive--have pass'd an active life, as country school-teacher, gardener,\r\nprinter, carpenter, author and journalist, domicil'd in nearly all the\r\nUnited States and principal cities, North and South--went to the front\r\n(moving about and occupied as army nurse and missionary) during the\r\nsecession war, 1861 to '65, and in the Virginia hospitals and after\r\nthe battles of that time, tending the Northern and Southern wounded\r\nalike--work'd down South and in Washington city arduously three\r\nyears--contracted the paralysis which I have suffer'd ever since--and\r\nnow live in a little cottage of my own, near the Delaware in New Jersey.\r\nMy chief book, unrhym'd and unmetrical (it has taken thirty years, peace\r\nand war, \"a borning\") has its aim, as once said, \"to utter the same old\r\nhuman _critter_--but now in Democratic American modern and scientific\r\nconditions.\" Then I have publish'd two prose works, \"Specimen Days,\" and\r\na late one, \"November Boughs.\" (A little volume, \"Good-Bye my Fancy,\"\r\nis soon to be out, wh' will finish the matter.) I do not propose here\r\nto enter the much-fought field of the literary criticism of any of those\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nBut for a few portraiture or descriptive bits. To-day in the upper story\r\nof a little wooden house of two stories near the Delaware river, east\r\nshore, sixty miles up from the sea, is a rather large 20-by-20 low\r\nceiling'd room something like a big old ship's cabin. The floor, three\r\nquarters of it with an ingrain carpet, is half cover'd by a deep litter\r\nof books, papers, magazines, thrown-down letters and circulars, rejected\r\nmanuscripts, memoranda, bits of light or strong twine, a bundle to be\r\n\"express'd,\" and two or three venerable scrap books. In the room stand\r\ntwo large tables (one of ancient St. Domingo mahogany with immense\r\nleaves) cover'd by a jumble of more papers, a varied and copious array\r\nof writing materials, several glass and china vessels or jars, some with\r\ncologne-water, others with real honey, granulated sugar, a large bunch\r\nof beautiful fresh yellow chrysanthemums, some letters and envelopt\r\npapers ready for the post office, many photographs, and a hundred\r\nindescribable things besides. There are all around many books, some\r\nquite handsome editions, some half cover'd by dust, some within reach,\r\nevidently used, (good-sized print, no type less than long primer,) some\r\nmaps, the Bible, (the strong cheap edition of the English crown,) Homer,\r\nShakspere, Walter Scott, Emerson, Ticknor's \"Spanish Literature,\" John\r\nCarlyle's Dante, Felton's \"Greece,\" George Sand's \"Consuelo,\" avery\r\nchoice little Epictetus, some novels, the latest foreign and American\r\nmonthlies, quarterlies, and so on. There being quite a strew of\r\nprinter's proofs and slips, and the daily papers, the place with its\r\nquaint old fashion'd calmness has also a smack of something alert and\r\nof current work. There are several trunks and depositaries back' d up\r\nat the walls; (one well-bound and big box came by express lately from\r\nWashington city, after storage there for nearly twenty years.) Indeed\r\nthe whole room is a sort of result and storage collection of my own past\r\nlife. I have here various editions of my own writings, and sell them\r\nupon request; one is a big volume of complete poems and prose, 1000\r\npages, autograph, essays, speeches, portraits from life, &c. Another is\r\na little \"Leaves of Grass,\" latest date, six portraits, morocco bound,\r\nin pocket-book form.\r\n\r\nFortunately the apartment is quite roomy. There are three windows in\r\nfront. At one side is the stove, with a cheerful fire of oak wood, near\r\nby a good supply of fresh sticks, whose faint aroma is plain. On another\r\nside is the bed with white coverlid and woollen blankets. Toward\r\nthe windows is a huge arm-chair, (a Christmas present from Thomas\r\nDonaldson's young daughter and son, Philadelphia) timber'd as by some\r\nstout ship's spars, yellow polish'd, ample, with rattan-woven seat and\r\nback, and over the latter a great wide wolf-skin of hairy black and\r\nsilver, spread to guard against cold and draught. A time-worn look and\r\nscent of old oak attach both to the chair and the person occupying it.\r\n\r\nBut probably (even at the charge of parrot talk) I can give no more\r\nauthentic brief sketch than \"from an old remembrance copy,\" where I have\r\nlately put myself on record as follows: Was born May 31, 1819, in my\r\nfather's farm-house, at West Hills, L.I., New York State. My parents'\r\nfolks mostly farmers and sailors--on my father's side, of English--on\r\nmy mother's (Van Velsor's), from Hollandic immigration. There was, first\r\nand last, a large family of children; (I was the second.) We moved to\r\nBrooklyn while I was still a little one in frocks--and there in B.\r\nI grew up out of frocks--then as child and boy went to the public\r\nschools--then to work in a printing office. When only sixteen or\r\nseventeen years old, and for three years afterward, I went to teaching\r\ncountry schools down in Queens and Suffolk counties, Long Island, and\r\n\"boarded round.\" Then, returning to New York, work'd as printer and\r\nwriter, (with an occasional shy at \"poetry.\")\r\n\r\n1848-'9.--About this time--after ten or twelve years of experiences and\r\nwork and lots of fun in New York and Brooklyn--went off on a leisurely\r\njourney and working expedition (my brother Jeff with me) through all the\r\nMiddle States, and down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Lived a while\r\nin New Orleans, and work'd there. (Have lived quite a good deal in\r\nthe Southern States.) After a time, plodded back northward, up the\r\nMississippi, the Missouri, &c., and around to, and by way of, the\r\ngreat lakes, Michigan, Huron and Erie, to Niagara Falls and Lower\r\nCanada--finally returning through Central New York, and down the Hudson.\r\n1852-'54--Occupied in house-building in Brooklyn. (For a little while of\r\nthe first part of that time in printing a daily and weekly paper.)\r\n\r\n1855.--Lost my dear father this year by death.... Commenced putting\r\n\"Leaves of Grass\" to press, for good--after many MSS. doings and\r\nundoings--(I had great trouble in leaving out the stock \"poetical\"\r\ntouches--but succeeded at last.) The book has since had some eight\r\nhitches or stages of growth, with one annex, (and another to come out in\r\n1891, which will complete it.)\r\n\r\n1862.--In December of this year went down to the field of war in\r\nVirginia. My brother George reported badly wounded in the Fredericksburg\r\nfight. (For 1863 and '64, see \"Specimen Days.\") 1865 to '71--Had a place\r\nas clerk (till well on in '73) in the Attorney.\r\n\r\nGeneral's Office, Washington. (New York and Brooklyn seem more like\r\n_home_, as I was born near, and brought up in them, and lived, man\r\nand boy, for 30 years. But I lived some years in Washington, and\r\nhave visited, and partially lived, in most of the Western and Eastern\r\ncities.)\r\n\r\n1873.--This year lost, by death, my dear dear mother--and, just before,\r\nmy sister Martha--the two best and sweetest women I have ever seen or\r\nknown, or ever expect to see. Same year, February, a sudden climax and\r\nprostration from paralysis. Had been simmering inside for several years;\r\nbroke out during those times temporarily, and then went over. But now a\r\nserious attack, beyond cure. Dr. Drinkard, my Washington physician,\r\n(and a first-rate one,) said it was the result of too extreme bodily and\r\nemotional strain continued at Washington and \"down in front,\" in 1863,\r\n'4 and '5. I doubt if a heartier, stronger, healthier physique, more\r\nbalanced upon itself, or more unconscious, more sound, ever lived, from\r\n1835 to '72. My greatest call (Quaker) to go around and do what I\r\ncould there in those war-scenes where I had fallen, among the sick and\r\nwounded, was, that I seem'd to be _so strong and well_. (I consider'd\r\nmyself invulnerable.) But this last attack shatter'd me completely. Quit\r\nwork at Washington, and moved to Camden, New Jersey--where I have lived\r\nsince, receiving many buffets and some precious caresses--and now\r\nwrite these lines. Since then, (1874-'91) a long stretch of illness, or\r\nhalf-illness, with occasional lulls. During these latter, have revised\r\nand printed over all my books--bro't out \"November Boughs\"--and at\r\nintervals leisurely and exploringly travel'd to the Prairie States, the\r\nRocky Mountains, Canada, to New York, to my birthplace in Long Island,\r\nand to Boston. But physical disability and the war-paralysis above\r\nalluded to to have settled upon me more and more the last year or so. Am\r\nnow (1891) domicil'd, and have been for some years, in this little old\r\ncottage and lot in Mickle street, Camden, with a house-keeper and man\r\nnurse. Bodily I am completely disabled, but still write for publication.\r\nI keep generally buoyant spirits, write often as there comes any lull\r\nin physical sufferings, get in the sun and down to the river whenever\r\nI can, retain fair appetite, assimilation and digestion, sensibilities\r\nacute as ever, the strength and volition of my right arm good, eyesight\r\ndimming, but brain normal, and retain my heart's and soul's unmitigated\r\nfaith not only in their own original literary plans, but in the\r\nessential bulk of American humanity east and west, north and south, city\r\nand country, through thick and thin, to the last. Nor must I forget,\r\nin conclusion, a special, prayerful, thankful God's blessing to my dear\r\nfirm friends and personal helpers, men and women, home and foreign, old\r\nand young.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUT IN THE OPEN AGAIN\r\n\r\n_From the Camden Post, April 16, '91_.\r\n\r\nWalt Whitman got out in the mid-April sun and warmth of yesterday,\r\npropelled in his wheel chair, the first time after four months of\r\nimprisonment in his sick room. He has had the worst winter yet, mainly\r\nfrom grippe and gastric troubles, and threaten'd blindness; but keeps\r\ngood spirits, and has a new little forthcoming book in the printer's\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICA'S BULK AVERAGE\r\n\r\nIf I were ask'd _persona_ to specify the one point of America's people\r\non which I mainly rely, I should say the final average or bulk quality\r\nof the whole.\r\n\r\nHappy indeed w'd I consider myself to give a fair reflection and\r\nrepresentation of even a portion of shows, questions, humanity, events,\r\nunfoldings, thoughts, &c. &c., my age in these States.\r\n\r\nThe great social, political, historic function of my time has been of\r\ncourse the attempted secession war.\r\n\r\nAnd was there not something grand, and an inside proof of perennial\r\ngrandeur, in that war! We talk of our age's and the States'\r\nmaterialism--and it is too true. But how amid the whole sordidness--the\r\nentire devotion of America, at any price, to pecuniary success,\r\nmerchandise--disregarding all but business and profit--this war for\r\na bare idea and abstraction--a mere, at bottom, heroic dream and\r\nreminiscence--burst forth in its great devouring flame and conflagration\r\nquickly and fiercely spreading and raging, and enveloping all, defining\r\nin two conflicting ideas--first the Union cause--second _the other_,\r\na strange deadly interrogation point, hard to define--Can we not now\r\nsafely confess it?--with magnificent rays, streaks of noblest heroism,\r\nfortitude, perseverance, and even conscientiousness, through its\r\npervadingly malignant darkness. What an area and rounded field, upon\r\nthe whole--the spirit, arrogance, grim tenacity of the South--the long\r\nstretches of murky gloom--the general National Will below and behind\r\nand comprehending all--not once really wavering, not a day, not an\r\nhour--What could be, or even can be, grander?\r\n\r\nAs in that war, its four years--as through the whole history and\r\ndevelopment of the New World--these States through all trials,\r\nprocesses, eruptions, deepest dilemmas, (often straining, tugging at\r\nsociety's heart-strings, as if some divine curiosity would find out how\r\nmuch this democracy could stand,) have so far finally and for more than\r\na century best justified themselves by the average impalpable quality\r\nand personality of the bulk, the People _en masse_.... I am not sure but\r\nmy main and chief however indefinite claim for any page of mine w'd be\r\nits derivation, or seeking to derive itself, f'm that average quality of\r\nthe American bulk, the people, and getting back to it again.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAST SAVED ITEMS\r\n\r\n_I'm a vast batch left to oblivion_.\r\n\r\nIn its highest aspect, and striking its grandest average, essential\r\nPoetry expresses and goes along with essential Religion--has been and\r\nis more the adjunct, and more serviceable to that true religion (for of\r\ncourse there is a false one and plenty of it) than all the priests and\r\ncreeds and churches that now exist or have ever existed--even while the\r\ntemporary prevalent theory and practice of poetry is merely one-side and\r\nornamental and dainty--a love-sigh, a bit of jewelry, a feudal conceit,\r\nan ingenious tale or intellectual _finesse_, adjusted to the low taste\r\nand calibre that will always sufficiently generally prevail--(ranges of\r\nstairs necessary to ascend the higher.)\r\n\r\nThe sectarian, church and doctrinal, follies, crimes, fanaticisms,\r\naggregate and individual, so rife all thro' history, are proofs of the\r\nradicalness and universality of the indestructible element of humanity's\r\nReligion, just as much as any, and are the other side of it. Just as\r\ndisease proves health, and is the other side of it.... The philosophy of\r\nGreece taught normality and the beauty of life. Christianity teaches how\r\nto endure illness and death. I have wonder'd whether a third philosophy\r\nfusing both, and doing full justice to both, might not be outlined.\r\n\r\nIt will not be enough to say that no Nation ever achiev'd materialistic,\r\npolitical and money-making successes, with general physical comfort, as\r\nfully as the United States of America are to-day achieving them. I know\r\nvery well that those are the indispensable foundations--the _sine\r\nqua non_ of moral and heroic (poetic) fruitions to come. For if those\r\npre-successes were all--if they ended at that--if nothing more\r\nwere yielded than so far appears--a gross materialistic prosperity\r\nonly--America, tried by subtlest tests, were a failure--has not advanced\r\nthe standard of humanity a bit further than other nations. Or, in plain\r\nterms, has but inherited and enjoy'd the results of ordinary claims and\r\npreceding ages.\r\n\r\nNature seem'd to use me a long while--myself all well, able, strong and\r\nhappy--to portray power, freedom, health. But after a while she seems to\r\nfancy, may-be I can see and understand it all better by being deprived\r\nof most of those.\r\n\r\nHow difficult it is to add anything more to literature--and how\r\nunsatisfactory for any earnest spirit to serve merely the amusement of\r\nthe multitude!

The Soul answer'd: No, not when we consider what\r\nit is all for--the end involved in Time and Space.\"--_An item from last\r\npage of \"Good-Bye.\"_\r\n\r\nH. Heine's first principle of criticising a book was, What motive is the\r\nauthor trying to carry out, or express or accomplish? and the second,\r\nHas he achiev'd it?\r\n\r\nThe theory of my _Leaves of Grass_ as a composition of verses has been\r\nfrom first to last, (if I am to give impromptu a hint of the spinal\r\nmarrow of the business, and sign it with my name,) to thoroughly possess\r\nthe mind, memory, cognizance of the author himself, with everything\r\nbeforehand--a full armory of concrete actualities, observations,\r\nhumanity, past poems, ballads, facts, technique, war and peace,\r\npolitics, North and South, East and West, nothing too large or too\r\nsmall, the sciences as far as possible--and above all America and the\r\npresent--after and out of which the subject of the poem, long or short,\r\nhas been invariably turned over to his Emotionality, even Personality,\r\nto be shaped thence; and emerges strictly therefrom, with all its merits\r\nand demerits on its head. Every page of my poetic or attempt at poetic\r\nutterance therefore smacks of the living physical identity, date,\r\nenvironment, individuality, probably beyond anything known, and in style\r\noften offensive to the conventions.\r\n\r\nThis new last cluster, _Good-By my Fancy_ follows suit, and yet with a\r\ndifference. The clef is here changed to its lowest, and the little book\r\nis a lot of tremolos about old age, death, and faith. The physical just\r\nlingers, but almost vanishes. The book is garrulous, irascible (like old\r\nLear) and has various breaks and even tricks to avoid monotony. It\r\nwill have to be ciphered and ciphered out long--and is probably in some\r\nrespects the most curious part of its author's baffling works.\r\n\r\n_Walt Whitman_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n[49] Published in _Lippincott's Magazine_, August, 1891, with the\r\nfollowing note added by the editor of the magazine: \"With _Good-Bye my\r\nFancy_, Walt Whitman has rounded out his life-work. This book is his\r\nlast message, and of course a great deal will be said about it by\r\ncritics all over the world, both in praise and dispraise; but probably\r\nnothing that the critics will say will be as interesting as this\r\ncharacteristic utterance upon the book by the poet himself. It is\r\nthe subjective view as opposed to the objective views of the critics.\r\nBriefly, Whitman gives, as he puts it, 'a hint of the spinal marrow of\r\nthe business,' not only of _Good-Bye my Fancy_, but also of the _Leaves\r\nof Grass_.\r\n\r\n\"It was only after considerable persuasion on the editor's part that Mr.\r\nWhitman consented to write the above. As a concise explanation of the\r\npoet's life-work it must have great value to his readers and admirers.\r\nAfter the critics 'have ciphered and ciphered out long,' they will\r\nprobably have nothing better to say.\"",
