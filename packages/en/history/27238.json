As a result, the sources of changes in\r\n     design are almost impossible to ascertain. Published sources,\r\n     moreover, have been concerned primarily with the object shaped by\r\n     the tool rather than the tool itself.

Welsh is curator, Growth of the United\r\n     States, in the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of History and\r\n     Technology._\r\n\r\nIn 1918, PROFESSOR W.M.F. PETRIE concluded a brief article on \"History\r\nin Tools\" with a reminder that the history of this subject \"has yet to\r\nbe studied,\" and lamented the survival of so few precisely dated\r\nspecimens. What Petrie found so discouraging in studying the implements\r\nof the ancient world has consistently plagued those concerned with tools\r\nof more recent vintage. Anonymity is the chief characteristic of hand\r\ntools of the last three centuries. The reasons are many: first, the tool\r\nis an object of daily use, subjected while in service to hard wear and,\r\nin some cases, ultimate destruction; second, a tool's usefulness is apt\r\nto continue through many years and through the hands of several\r\ngenerations of craftsmen, with the result that its origins become lost;\r\nthird, the achievement of an implement of demonstrated proficiency\r\ndictated against radical, and therefore easily datable, changes in shape\r\nor style; and fourth, dated survivals needed to establish a range of\r\nfirm control specimens for the better identification of unknowns,\r\nparticularly the wooden elements of tools--handles, moldings, and plane\r\nbodies--are frustratingly few in non-arid archaeological sites. When\r\ntracing the provenance of American tools there is the additional problem\r\nof heterogeneous origins and shapes--that is, what was the appearance\r\nof a given tool prior to its standardization in England and the United\r\nStates? The answer requires a brief summary of the origin of selected\r\ntool shapes, particularly those whose form was common to both the\r\nBritish Isles and the Continent in the 17th century. Beyond this, when\r\ndid the shape of English tools begin to differ from the shape of tools\r\nof the Continent? Finally, what tool forms predominated in American\r\nusage and when, if in fact ever, did any of these tools achieve a\r\ndistinctly American character? In the process of framing answers to\r\nthese questions, one is confronted by a constantly diminishing\r\nliterature, coupled with a steadily increasing number of tool types.[1]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 1.--1685: THE PRINCIPAL TOOLS that the carpenter\r\nneeded to frame a house, as listed by JOHANN AMOS COMENIUS in his _Orbis\r\nSensualium Pictus_ were the felling axe (4), wedge and beetle (7 and 8),\r\nchip axe (10), saw (12), trestle (14), and pulley (15). (Charles Hoole\r\ntransl., London, 1685. _Courtesy of the Folger Shakespeare Library_.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--1685: THE BOXMAKER AND TURNER as pictured by\r\nComenius required planes (3 and 5), workbench (4), auger (6), knife (7),\r\nand lathe (14). (From Johann Amos Comenius, _Orbis Sensualium Pictus.\r\nCourtesy of the Folger Shakespeare Library_.)]\r\n\r\nThe literature of the subject, both new and old, is sparse, with\r\ninterest always centering upon the object shaped by the craftsman's tool\r\nrather than upon the tool itself. Henry Mercer's _Ancient Carpenters'\r\nTools_, first published in 1929, is an exception. It remains a rich\r\nsource of information based primarily on the marvelous collections\r\npreserved by the Bucks County Historical Society. Since 1933, the Early\r\nAmerican Industries Association, both through collecting and through its\r\n_Chronicle_, has called attention to the vanishing trades, their tools\r\nand techniques; the magazine _Antiques_ has occasionally dealt with this\r\nsubject. Historians of economic and industrial development usually\r\nneglect the tools of the woodcrafts, and when considering the\r\ntoolmakers, they have reference only to the inventors and producers of\r\nmachine tools. The dearth of written material is somewhat compensated\r\nfor by the collections of hand tools in American museums and\r\nrestorations, notably those at Williamsburg, Cooperstown, Old Sturbridge\r\nVillage, Winterthur, the Henry Ford Museum, and Shelburne; at the latter\r\nin particular the extensive collection has been bolstered by Frank H.\r\nWildung's museum pamphlet, \"Woodworking Tools at Shelburne Museum.\"\r\nThe most informative recent American work on the subject is Eric\r\nSloane's handsomely illustrated _A Museum of Early American Tools_,\r\npublished in 1964. Going beyond just the tools of the woodworker,\r\nSloane's book also includes agricultural implements. It is a delightful\r\ncombination of appreciation of early design, nostalgia, and useful fact.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--1703: THE TOOLS OF THE JOINER illustrated by\r\nMoxon are the workbench (A), fore plane (B. 1), jointer (B. 2),\r\nstrike-block (B. 3), smoothing plane (B. 4 and B. 7), rabbet plane (B.\r\n5), plow (B. 6), forming chisels (C. 1 and C. 3), paring chisel (C. 2),\r\nskew former (C. 4), mortising chisel (sec.

(Moxon,\r\n_Mechanick Exercises_ ..., 1703. Library of Congress.)]\r\n\r\nCharles Hummel's forthcoming _With Hammer in Hand: The Dominy Craftsmen\r\nof East Hampton_--to be published by the Yale University Press--will be\r\na major contribution to the literature dealing with Anglo-American\r\nwoodworking tools. Hummel's book will place in perspective Winterthur\r\nMuseum's uniquely documented Dominy Woodshop Collection. This extensive\r\ncollection of tools--over a thousand in number--is rich in attributed\r\nand dated examples which range from the early 18th through the mid-19th\r\ncentury. The literature of the subject has been greatly enhanced by the\r\nEnglish writer, W.L. Goodman. Extending a series of articles that first\r\nappeared in the _Journal of The Institute of Handicraft Teachers_,\r\nGoodman has put together a well-researched _History of Woodworking\r\nTools_ (London, 1964), one particularly useful for its wealth of\r\nillustration from antiquity and the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecialization\r\n\r\nGiven the limitations of precise dating, uncertain provenance, and an\r\nuneven literature, what can be learned about woodworking tools after\r\n1600? In some instances, design change can be noted and documented to\r\nprovide at least a general criteria for dating. Frequently, the original\r\nappearance of tools can be documented. For some hand tools,\r\ncharacteristics can be established that denote a national origin. Not\r\ninfrequently a tool's style, decorative motif, or similarity to other\r\nobjects that coexisted at a given time can suggest, even in relatively\r\nmodern times, the values of the society that produced it. The source of\r\nsuch information derived from the hand tool is generally visual,\r\nrecorded in the tool itself or in pictures of it and supported by\r\nmanuscript and printed material.\r\n\r\nSurvey the principal printed sources of the 17th, 18th, and 19th\r\ncenturies. The first thing that is apparent is a remarkable\r\nproliferation of tool types without any significant change in the\r\ndefinition and description of the carpenter's or joiner's task. Begin in\r\n1685 with Charles Hoole's translation of Johann Amos Comenius' _Orbis\r\nSensualium Pictus_ for use as a Latin grammar. Among the occupations\r\nchosen to illustrate vocabulary and usage were the carpenter (fig. 1),\r\nthe boxmaker (cabinetmaker), and the turner (fig. 2). \"The Carpenter,\"\r\naccording to Hoole's text, \"squareth Timber with a Chip ax ... and\r\nsaweth it with a Saw\" while the more specialized \"Box-maker, smootheth\r\nhewen-Boards with a Plain upon a Work-board, he maketh them very smooth\r\nwith a little plain, he boarth them thorow with an Augre, carveth them\r\nwith a Knife, fasteneth them together with Glew, and Cramp-irons, and\r\nmaketh Tables, Boards, Chests &c.\" Hoole repeated Comenius' plates with\r\nthe result that the craftsman's tools and his work have the same\r\ncharacteristic medieval flavor as the text.[2]\r\n\r\nJoseph Moxon in his well-quoted work on the mechanic arts defined\r\njoinery as \"an Art Manual, whereby several Pieces of Wood are so fitted\r\nand join'd together by Straight-line, Squares, Miters or any Bevel, that\r\nthey shall seem one intire Piece.\" Including the workbench, Moxon\r\ndescribed and illustrated 30 tools (fig. 3) needed by the joiner. The\r\ncarpenter's tools were less favored by illustration; only 13 were\r\npictured (fig. 4). The tools that the carpenter used were the same as\r\nthose of the joiner except that the carpenter's tools were structurally\r\nstronger. The axe serves as a good example of the difference. The\r\njoiner's axe was light and short handled with the left side of the\r\ncutting edge bezeled to accommodate one-handed use. The carpenter's axe,\r\non the other hand, was intended \"to hew great Stuff\" and was made deeper\r\nand heavier to facilitate the squaring and beveling of timbers.[3] By\r\nmid-18th century the craft of joiner and carpenter had been completely\r\nrationalized in Diderot's _Encyclopédie_ and by André Roubo in his\r\n_L'Art du menuisier_, a part of Duhamel's _Descriptions des arts et\r\nmétiers_. Diderot, for example, illustrates 14 bench planes alone,\r\ngenerally used by the joiner (fig. 5), while Roubo suggests the steady\r\nsophistication of the art in a plate showing the special planes and\r\nirons required for fine molding and paneling (fig. 6).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5.--1769: THE BENCH PLANES OF THE JOINER increased\r\nin number, but in appearance they remained much the same as those\r\nillustrated by Moxon. (Denis Diderot, _Recueil de planches sur les\r\nscience et les arts libéraux_, Paris, 1769, vol. 7, \"Menuiserie.\"\r\nSmithsonian photo 56630.)]\r\n\r\nDespite such thoroughness, without the addition of the several plates it\r\nwould be almost impossible to visualize, through the descriptive text\r\nalone, the work of the carpenter and joiner except, of course, in modern\r\nterms. This is particularly true of the numerous texts on building, such\r\nas Batty Langley's _The Builder's Complete Assistant_ (1738) and Francis\r\nPrice's _The British Carpenter_ (1765), where building techniques are\r\nwell described but illustration of tools is omitted. This inadequacy\r\ngrows. In two 19th-century American editions of British works, _The Book\r\nof Trades_, printed at Philadelphia in 1807, and Hazen's _Panorama of\r\nthe Professions and Trades_ (1838), the descriptions of the carpenter's\r\ntrade are extremely elementary.\r\n\r\nThomas Martin's _Circle of the Mechanical Arts_ (1813), although far\r\nmore thorough than many texts, still defined carpentry \"as the art of\r\ncutting out, framing, and joining large pieces of wood, to be used in\r\nbuilding\" and joinery as \"small work\" or what \"is called by the French,\r\n_menuiserie_.\" Martin enumerated 16 tools most useful to the carpenter\r\nand 21 commonly used by the joiner; in summary, he noted, as had Moxon,\r\nthat \"both these arts are subservient to architecture, being employed in\r\nraising, roofing, flooring and ornamenting buildings of all kinds\" (fig.\r\n7).[4]\r\n\r\nIn Peter Nicholson's _The Mechanic's Companion_ (figs. 8, 9, and 10),\r\nthe all-too-familiar definition of carpentry as \"the art of employing\r\ntimber in the construction of buildings\" suggests very little of the\r\ncarpenter's actual work or the improvement in tool design that had\r\noccurred since Moxon's _Exercises_. From Nicholson's list of the tools\r\nrequired by the carpenter--\"a ripping saw, a hand saw, an axe, an adze,\r\na socket chisel, a firmer chisel, a ripping chisel, an auguer, a gimlet,\r\na hammer, a mallet, a pair of pincers, and sometimes planes\"--there\r\nwould seem at first glance slight advance since the 1600's. The\r\nenumeration of the joiner's tools, however, indicates a considerable\r\nproliferation, particularly when compared to earlier writers. By the\r\nearly 19th century, the more refined work of joinery required over 50\r\ntools.\r\n\r\n     The bench planes [instructed Nicholson] are, the jack plane, the\r\n     fore plane, the trying plane, the long plane, the jointer, and the\r\n     smoothing plane; the cylindric plane, the compass and forkstaff\r\n     planes; the straight block, for straightening short edges. Rebating\r\n     planes are the moving fillister, the sash fillister, the common\r\n     rebating plane, the side rebating plane. Grooving planes are the\r\n     plough and dado grooving planes. Moulding planes are sinking\r\n     snipebills, side snipebills, beads, hollows and rounds, ovolos and\r\n     ogees. Boring tools are: gimlets, bradawls, stock, and bits.\r\n     Instruments for dividing the wood, are principally the ripping saw,\r\n     the half ripper, the hand saw, the panel saw, the tenon saw, the\r\n     carcase saw, the sash saw, the compass saw, the keyhole saw, and\r\n     turning saw. Tools used for forming the angles of two adjoining\r\n     surfaces, are squares and bevels. Tools used for drawing parallel\r\n     lines are gauges. Edge tools are the firmer chisel, the mortise\r\n     chisel, the socket chisel, the gouge, the hatchet, the adze, the\r\n     drawing knife. Tools for knocking upon wood and iron are, the\r\n     mallet and hammer. Implements for sharpening tools are the grinding\r\n     stone, the rub stone, and the oil or whet stone.[5]\r\n\r\nReflecting what the text writers listed, toolmakers by the end of the\r\n18th century gave buyers a wide choice. The catalogue of Sheffield's\r\nCastle Hill Works offered 20 combinations of ready-stocked tool chests;\r\nthe simplest contained 12 carpenter's tools and the most complex, 39,\r\nplus, if desired, an additional assortment of gardening implements (fig.\r\n11). In 1857, the Arrowmammett Works of Middletown, Connecticut,\r\nproducers of bench and molding planes, published an illustrated\r\ncatalogue that offered 34 distinct types that included everything from\r\nhollows and rounds to double jointers and hand-rail planes (fig.\r\n12).[6]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6.--1774: ANDRÉ ROUBO'S _L'Art du menuisier_\r\ncontains detailed plates and descriptions of the most specialized of\r\nwoodworking planes: those used to cut panel moldings. The conformation\r\nof these tools was still distinctly in keeping with the Moxon type and\r\nsuggests that, at least in Europe, no remarkable change had yet occurred\r\nin the shape of planes. (André-Jacob Roubo, _L'Art du menuisier_:\r\nTroisième partie, troisième section, l'art du menuisier ébéniste [Paris,\r\n1774]. Smithsonian photo 49790-D.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 7.--1813: THOMAS MARTIN ILLUSTRATED ON ONE PLATE\r\nthe tools of the carpenter and joiner dividing them as follows: the\r\ntools most useful to the carpenter, the axe (7), adz (6), saw (24),\r\nsocket chisel (13), firmer chisel (5), auger (1), gimlet (3), gauge\r\n(16), square (9), compass (36), hammer (21), mallet (22), hookpin (11),\r\ncrow (12), plumb rule (18), and level (19); and the tools most often\r\nassociated with joinery, the jack plane (30), trying plane (31),\r\nsmoothing plane (34), tenon saw (25), compass saw (26), keyhole saw\r\n(27), square (8), bevel (23), gauge (17), mortise chisel (4), gouge\r\n(14), turnscrew (15), plow plane (29), molding plane (35), pincers (37),\r\nbradawl (10), stock and bit (2), sidehook (20), workbench (28), and rule\r\n(38). The planes are of particular interest since they show clearly a\r\nchange in form from those previously illustrated. (Thomas Martin, _The\r\nCircle of the Mechanical Arts_, London, 1813.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 8.--1832: PETER NICHOLSON ILLUSTRATED an\r\ninteresting mixture of old and new forms. An updating of Moxon,\r\nNicholson's carpenter required an axe (1), adz (2), socket chisel (3),\r\nmortise and tenon gauge (4), square (5), plumb rule (6), level (7),\r\nauger (8), hookpin (9), and crow (10). (Peter Nicholson, _The Mechanic's\r\nCompanion_. 1st American ed., Philadelphia, 1832. Smithsonian photo\r\n56633.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 9.--1832: THE WORKBENCH DELINEATED BY NICHOLSON\r\nwas little improved over Moxon's, although the planes--jack (1), trying\r\nplane (2), smoothing plane (3), sash fillister (7), and plow\r\n(8)--followed the form seen in Martin (fig. 7). The inception of this\r\nshape occurred in the shops of Sheffield toolmakers in the last half of\r\nthe 18th century, and it persisted until replaced by metallic versions\r\npatented by American innovators during the last quarter of the 19th\r\ncentury. (Nicholson, _The Mechanic's Companion_. Smithsonian photo\r\n56631.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 10.--1832: THE BRACE AND BIT, GIMLET, CHISELS, AND\r\nSAWS, having achieved a standard form distinctly different than those of\r\nMoxon's vintage, were, like the plane, slow to change. The metallic\r\nversion of the brace did not replace the standard Sheffield type (1) in\r\nthe United States until after 1850. For all intent and purpose the saw\r\nstill retains the characteristics illustrated in Nicholson. Of interest\r\nis Nicholson's comment regarding the saws; namely, that the double\r\nhandle was peculiar to the hand (6) and tenon saws (7), while the\r\ncompass (9) and the sash saws (8) had the single handle. In addition the\r\ntenon saw was generally backed in iron and the sash saw in brass.\r\n(Nicholson, _The Mechanic's Companion_. Smithsonian photo 56632.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 11.--EARLY 19TH CENTURY: THE ADVERTISEMENTS OF\r\nTOOLMAKERS indicated the diversity of production. The Castle Hill Works\r\nat Sheffield offered to gentlemen 20 choices of tool chests designed to\r\nappeal to a wide variety of users and purses. The chest was available in\r\neither oak or mahogany, depending on the gentleman's tastes (fig. 49).\r\n(Book 87, Cutler and Company, Castle Hill Works, Sheffield. _Courtesy of\r\nthe Victoria and Albert Museum_.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 12.--1857: THE DIVERSITY OF TOOLS available to\r\nbuyers made necessary the illustrated trade catalogue. Although few in\r\nnumber in the United States before 1850, tool catalogues became\r\nvoluminous in the last half of the century as printing costs dropped.\r\n(Smithsonian Institution Library. Smithsonian photo 49790.)]\r\n\r\nAmerican inventories reflect the great increase suggested by the early\r\ntechnical writers and trade catalogues cited above. Compare the content\r\nof two American carpenters' shops--one of 1709, in York County,\r\nVirginia, and the other of 1827, in Middleborough, Massachusetts. John\r\nCrost, a Virginian, owned, in addition to sundry shoemaking and\r\nagricultural implements, a dozen gimlets, chalklines, bung augers, a\r\ndozen turning tools and mortising chisels, several dozen planes (ogees,\r\nhollows and rounds, and plows), several augers, a pair of 2-foot rules,\r\na spoke shave, lathing hammers, a lock saw, three files, compasses,\r\nparing chisels, a jointer's hammer, three handsaws, filling axes, a\r\nbroad axe, and two adzes. Nearly 120 years later Amasa Thompson listed\r\nhis tools and their value.

(Smithsonian photo 49792-G.)]\r\n\r\nBy 1900, the carpenter's tool chest, fully stocked and fit for the\r\nfinest craftsman, contained 90 or more tools. Specialization is readily\r\napparent; the change in, and achievement of, the ultimate design of a\r\nspecific tool is not so easily pinpointed. Only by comparing\r\nillustrations and surviving examples can such an evolution be\r\nappreciated and in the process, whether pondering the metamorphosis of a\r\nplane, a brace and bit, or an auger, the various stages of change\r\nencountered coincide with the rise of modern industrial society.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 14.--1688: FRONTISPIECE FROM JOHN BROWN, _The\r\nDescription and Use of the Carpenter's Rule_, London, 1688. (Library of\r\nCongress.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n\r\nHand tools are often neglected in the search for the pleasing objects of\r\nthe past. Considered too utilitarian, their decorative appeal--the\r\nmellow patina of the wood plane or the delicately tapered legs of a pair\r\nof dividers--often goes unnoticed. Surprisingly modern in design, the\r\nancient carpenter's or cabinetmaker's tool has a vitality of line that\r\ncan, without reference to technical significance, make it an object of\r\nconsiderable grace and beauty. The hand tool is frequently a lively and\r\ndecorative symbol of a society at a given time--a symbol, which,\r\naccording to the judges at London's Crystal Palace Exhibition in 1851,\r\ngives \"indications of the peculiar condition and habits of the people\r\nwhence they come, of their social and industrial wants and aims, as well\r\nas their natural or acquired advantages.\"[8] The hand tool, therefore,\r\nshould be considered both as an object of appealing shape and a document\r\nillustrative of society and its progress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 15.--18TH CENTURY: Cabinetmaker's dividers of\r\nEnglish origin. (Private collection. Smithsonian photo 49789-B.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 16.--1783: CABINETMAKER'S dividers of English\r\nmanufacture, dated, and marked T. Pearmain. See detail, figure 17.\r\n(Smithsonian photo 49792-C.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 17.--1783: DETAIL OF CABINETMAKER'S DIVIDERS\r\nshowing name and date.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 18.--18TH CENTURY: Carpenter's dividers of English\r\norigin, undated. (Smithsonian photo 49792-B.)]\r\n\r\nOn first sight, it is the conformation rather than any facet of its\r\ntechnical or social significance that strikes the eye; perhaps the most\r\ndecorative of tools are early dividers and calipers which, prior to\r\ntheir standardization, existed in seemingly endless variety. The great\r\ndividers used by the shipbuilder and architect for scribing and\r\nmeasuring timbers not only indicate building techniques (accession\r\n61.548) but also document 17th-and early 18th-century decorative\r\nmetalwork, as seen in figure 13. Well before the 17th century, artists\r\nand engravers recognized them as intriguing shapes to include in any\r\npotpourri of instruments, either in cartouches or the frontispieces of\r\nbooks (fig. 14).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 19.--1855: THE FRONTISPIECE FROM EDWARD SHAW, _The\r\nModern Architect_ (Boston, 1855), shows the carpenter's dividers in the\r\nforeground unchanged in form from those illustrated in figure 18. Of\r\nfurther interest in Shaw's plate is the dress of the workmen and the\r\nballoon frame of the house under construction. (Smithsonian photo\r\n49792-A.)]\r\n\r\nThe two pairs of cabinetmaker's dividers illustrated in figures 15 and\r\n16 suggest significant changes in the design of a basic tool. The\r\ndividers shown in figure 15 are English and would seem to be of early\r\n18th-century origin, perhaps even earlier. They are Renaissance in\r\nfeeling with decorated legs and a heart-shaped stop on the end of the\r\nslide-arm. In character, they are like the great dividers shown in\r\nfigure 13: functional, but at the same time preserving in their\r\ndecoration the features common to a wide variety of ironwork and wares\r\nbeyond the realm of tools alone. The dividers pictured in figure 16 are\r\na decided contrast. Dated 1783, they are strongly suggestive of\r\nSheffield origin. Gone is the superfluous decoration; in its place is\r\nthe strong, crisp line of a tool that has reached nearly the ultimate of\r\nfunction and manufacture, a device which both in general appearance and\r\nprecise design is very modern in execution. Equally intriguing are the\r\nsmaller, more slender dividers (accession 319557) of the 18th-century\r\nhouse-builder as seen in figure 18, a form that changed very little, if\r\nat all, until after 1850--a fact confirmed by the frontispiece of Edward\r\nShaw's _The Modern Architect_, published in Boston in 1855 (fig. 19).\r\nThe double calipers of the woodturner (fig. 20) have by far the most\r\nappealing and ingenious design of all such devices. Designed for\r\nconvenience, few tools illustrate better the aesthetic of the purely\r\nfunctional than this pair of 19th-century American calipers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 20.--EARLY 19TH CENTURY: THE DOUBLE CALIPERS of\r\nthe woodturner permitted double readings to be taken without changing\r\nthe set of the tool. Inherent in this practical design is a gracefulness\r\nof line seldom surpassed. (Private collection. Smithsonian photo\r\n49793-C.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 21.--1704: THE FLOOR PLANE OR LONG JOINER of\r\nNorwegian origin exhibits the characteristic decoration of the stock and\r\nmouth, patterns common on tools of northern European and Scandinavian\r\norigin. (_Courtesy of the Norsk Folkemuseum, Oslo, Norway._)]\r\n\r\nIntended to establish proportion and to insure precision, it seems a\r\nnatural consequence that dividers and calipers should in themselves\r\nreflect the same sense of balance and grace that they were designed to\r\ngovern. Still, even the most prosaic examples of woodworking tools,\r\ncompletely divorced from the quasi-mathematical devices of measure and\r\nproportion, have this quality and can be admired solely as decorative\r\nobjects. This is most evident in the three European bench planes\r\nillustrated in figures 21, 22, and 23: one Norwegian, dated 1704; one\r\nDutch (accession 319562), dated 1756; and one German, dated 1809. The\r\nNorwegian and German examples, with their elaborately carved bodies and\r\nheart-shaped mouths, are typical of the type that Swedish and German\r\ncolonists in America might have used in the 17th and 18th centuries.\r\nThey are important for that reason. Also, all three exhibit elaboration\r\nfound on other material survivals from these countries in their\r\nrespective periods. For example, the incised rosette of the Dutch plane\r\n(fig. 22) is especially suggestive of the rosettes found on English and\r\nAmerican furniture of the 1750's and 1760's, specifically on high\r\nchests.\r\n\r\nThe decorative motifs that characterized European tools of the 17th and\r\n18th centuries obscured technical improvement. By contrast, in England\r\nand America, tools gained distinction through the directness of their\r\ndesign. Following English patterns, tools of American make were\r\nstraightforward. Only later, in new tool types, did they imitate the\r\nrococo flourish of their European predecessors. In America, as in\r\nEngland, the baroque for things functional seemingly had little appeal.\r\nThis is particularly true of woodworking planes on which, unlike their\r\ncontinental cousins, embellishment is rarely seen. Exemplifying this\r\ntradition are three early 19th-century American planes: a plow, for\r\ncutting channels of various widths on board edges, marked \"G. White,\r\nPhilda\" (fig. 24); a rabbet, for notching the margin of boards; made\r\nby E.W. Carpenter of Lancaster, Pennsylvania (fig. 25); and a jack or\r\nforeplane, for rough surfacing (accession 61.547), made by A. Klock and\r\ndated 1818 as seen in figure 26.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 22.--1756: THE HIGHLY elaborated stock and\r\nrosette-incised wedge of the smoothing plane recall the decoration on\r\nfurniture of the period. The plane is of Dutch origin. (Smithsonian\r\nphoto 49792-F.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 23.--1809: THIS BENCH PLANE of German origin is\r\ndated 1809. It is of a traditional form that persists to the present\r\nday. The planes pictured in figures 21, 22, and 23 are similar to the\r\ntype brought to North America by non-English colonists. (Private\r\ncollection. Smithsonian photo 49793-F.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 24.--ABOUT 1818: This plow plane, used to cut\r\nnarrow channels on the edges of boards, was made by G. White of\r\nPhiladelphia in the early 19th century. It is essentially the same tool\r\ndepicted in the catalogues of Sheffield manufactures and in the plates\r\nfrom Martin and Nicholson. The pattern of the basic bench tools used in\r\nAmerica consistently followed British design, at least until the last\r\nquarter of the 19th century. (Private collection. Smithsonian photo\r\n49794-E.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 25. 1830-1840: THE DESIGN OF the rabbet plane,\r\nused to cut a groove of fixed width and depth on the edge of a board,\r\nwas not improved upon in the 19th century. The carpenter's dependence on\r\nthis tool lessened only after the perfection of multipurpose metallic\r\nplanes that could be readily converted to cut a \"rabbet.\" (Private\r\ncollection. Smithsonian photo 494789-H).]\r\n\r\nThe question of dating arises, since only the Klock piece is firmly\r\nfixed. How, for example, is the early 19th-century attribution arrived\r\nat for the planes inscribed White and Carpenter? First, the nature of\r\nthe stamped name \"G. White\" is of proper character for the period.\r\nSecond, G. White is listed in the Philadelphia city directories as a\r\n\"plane-maker\" between the years 1818 and 1820, working at the back of 5\r\nFilbert Street and later at 34 Juliana Street. Third, internal evidence\r\non the plane itself gives a clue. In this case, the hardware--rivets and\r\nfurrels--is similar if not identical to that found on firearms of the\r\nperiod, weapons whose dates of manufacture are known. The decorative\r\nmolding on the fence of this plane is proper for the period; this is not\r\na reliable guide, however, since similar moldings are retained\r\nthroughout the century. Finally, the plane is equipped with a fence\r\ncontrolled by slide-arms, fixed with wedges and not by adjustable screw\r\narms. After 1830, tools of high quality, such as White's, invariably\r\nhave the screw arms. The rabbet plane, made by Carpenter, is traceable\r\nvia another route, the U.S. Patent Office records. Carpenter,\r\nself-designated \"toolmaker of Lancaster,\" submitted patents for the\r\nimprovement of wood planes between 1831 and 1849. Examples of\r\nCarpenter's work, always stamped as shown in figure 27, survive, both\r\ndated and undated. There are several of his planes in the collections of\r\nthe Bucks County Historical Society, and dated pieces are known in\r\nprivate collections.\r\n\r\nInherent in the bench planes is a feeling of motion, particularly in the\r\nplow and the rabbet where basic design alone conveys the idea that they\r\nwere meant to move over fixed surfaces. Of the three examples, only the\r\nbrass tippings and setscrew of the plow plane suggest any enrichment,\r\nand of course these were not intended for decoration; in later years,\r\nhowever, boxwood, fruitwood, and even ivory tips were added to the more\r\nexpensive factory models. Also unintentional, but pleasing, is the\r\ndistinctive throat of the rabbet plane--a design that developed to\r\npermit easy discharge of shavings, and one that mass manufacture did\r\nnot destroy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 26.--1818: THE JACK PLANE, used first by the\r\ncarpenter for rapid surfacing, is distinguished primarily by the bezeled\r\nand slightly convex edge of its cutting iron.

Note in particular the planes,\r\naxe, brace, and auger as compared to Moxon.

(Library of Congress.)]\r\n\r\nThe divergence from European to an Anglo-American hand-tool design and\r\nthe approximate date that it occurred can be suggested by a comparison\r\nof contemporary illustrations. The change in the wooden bench plane can\r\nbe followed from the early 17th century through its standardization at\r\nthe end of the 18th century. Examine first the planes as drawn in the\r\n1630's by the Dutchman Jan Van Vliet (fig. 28), an etcher of Rembrandt's\r\nschool at Leiden, and also the examples illustrated by Porzelius (fig.\r\n29) and by Jost Amman (fig. 30). Compare them to Moxon's plate (fig. 31)\r\nfrom the _Mechanick Exercises_ (3rd ed., 1703) and to the splendid\r\ndrawing of the bench plane from André-Jacob Roubo's _L'Art du\r\nmenuisier_, published in 1769 (fig. 32). In all of them, the rounded\r\nhandle, or tote, and the fore-horn appear, characteristics of both\r\nEuropean and English planes of the period before 1750. The similarity\r\nends with the mass production of hand tools from the shops of the\r\nEnglish toolmaking centers, principally Sheffield. An illustration from\r\na pattern and design book of the Castle Hill Works, Sheffield, dating\r\nfrom the last quarter of the 18th century (fig. 33), shows the achieved,\r\nfamiliar form of the bench planes, as well as other tools. The use of\r\nthis form in America is readily documented in Lewis Miller's\r\nself-portrait while working at his trade in York, Pennsylvania, in 1810\r\n(fig. 34) and by the shop sign carved by Isaac Fowle in 1820 for John\r\nBradford (fig. 35). In each example, the bench plane clearly follows the\r\nEnglish prototype.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 31.--1703: DETAIL OF THE BENCH PLANES from Moxon's\r\n_Mechanick Exercises_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 32.--1769: ANDRÉ-JACOB ROUBO'S PRECISE RENDERING\r\nof the bench plane retains the essential features shown by Moxon--the\r\nrounded tote or handle and the curved fore-horn.

(Original patent drawing 51,660,\r\nU.S. Patent Office, Record Group 241, the National Archives.)]\r\n\r\nThe carpenter's brace is another instance of divergent design after a\r\ncommon origin. Refer again to Van Vliet's etching of the woodworker's\r\nshop (fig. 28), to the detail from Moxon (fig. 36), and from Roubo (fig.\r\n37). All show the brace in a form familiar since the Middle Ages, a\r\nshape common to both delineators and craftsmen of the Continent and the\r\nBritish Isles. But, as the plane changed, so changed the brace. The\r\nstandard form of this tool as it was used and produced in the United\r\nStates in the 19th century can be seen in another plate from the\r\ncatalogue of the Castle Hill Works at Sheffield (fig. 38). This English\r\ninfluence on American tool design is no surprise, since as early as 1634\r\nWilliam Wood in _New England's Prospect_ suggested that colonists take\r\nto the New World \"All manner of Ironwares, as all manner of nailes for\r\nhouses ... with Axes both broad and pitching ... All manners of Augers,\r\npiercing bits, Whip-saws, Two handed saws, Froes ..., rings for Bettle\r\nheads, and Iron-wedges.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 45.--19TH CENTURY: THE UPHOLSTERER'S HAMMER is an\r\nunknown; it is not dated, its maker is anonymous, as is its user. It is\r\nof American origin, yet of a style that might have been used in England\r\nor on the Continent. This lack of provenance need not detract from its\r\nsignificance as a material survival. This hammer, the brace (fig. 46),\r\nthe bevel (fig. 47), and the compass saw (fig. 48) are sufficiently\r\nprovocative in their design to conjure some image of a technology\r\ndependent upon the skilled hand of craftsmen working in wood and of the\r\nrelationship between the hand, the tool, and the finished product.\r\n(Smithsonian photo 49793-A.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 46.--18TH CENTURY: THE BRACE AND BIT in its\r\nnonfactory form conforms to a general design pattern in which none of\r\nthe components are ever precisely alike. This aspect of variety of\r\ndetail--sophistication, crudeness, decorative qualities or the\r\nlike--reflects something of the individuality of the toolmaker, a\r\nquality completely lost in the standardization of the carpenter's brace.\r\n(Smithsonian photo 49794-A.)]\r\n\r\nEnglish tool design in the 18th century also influenced the continental\r\ntoolmakers. This can be seen in figure 39 in a transitional-type\r\nbitstock (accession 319556) from the Low Countries. Adopting an English\r\nshape, but still preserving the ancient lever device for holding the bit\r\nin place, the piece with its grapevine embellishment is a marked\r\ncontrast to the severely functional brass chucks on braces of English\r\nmanufacture. No less a contrast are metallic versions of the brace.\r\nThese begin to appear with some regularity in the U.S. patent\r\nspecifications of the 1840's; their design is apparently derived from\r\n18th-century precedents. Roubo (fig. 40) illustrated a metal bitstock in\r\n1769, as did Ford, Whitmore & Brunton, makers of jewelers' and\r\nwatchmakers' tools, of Birmingham, England, in their trade catalogue of\r\n1775 (fig. 41). Each suggests a prototype of the patented forms of the\r\n1840's. For example, in 1852, Jacob Switzer of Basil, Ohio, suggested,\r\nas had Roubo a hundred years earlier, that the bitstock be used as a\r\nscrewdriver (fig. 42); but far more interesting than Switzer's idea was\r\nhis delineation of the brace itself, which he described as \"an ordinary\r\nbrace and bit stock\" (U.S. pat. 9,457). The inference is that such a\r\ntool form was already a familiar one among the woodworking trades in the\r\nUnited States. Disregarding the screwdriver attachment, which is not\r\nwithout merit, Switzer's stock represents an accurate rendering of what\r\nwas then a well-known form if not as yet a rival of the older wooden\r\nbrace. Likewise, J. Parker Gordon's patent 52,042 of 1866 exemplifies\r\nthe strengthening of a basic tool by the use of iron (fig. 43) and, as a\r\nresult, the achievement of an even greater functionalism in design. The\r\ncomplete break with the medieval, however, is seen in a drawing\r\nsubmitted to the Commissioner of Patents in 1865 (pat. 51,660) by Milton\r\nV. Nobles of Rochester, New York.[9] Nobles' creation was of thoroughly\r\nmodern design and appearance in which, unlike earlier types, the bit was\r\nheld in place by a solid socket, split sleeve, and a tightening ring\r\n(fig. 44). In three centuries, three distinct design changes occurred in\r\nthe carpenter's brace. First, about 1750, the so-called English or\r\nSheffield bitstock appeared. This was followed in the very early 19th\r\ncentury by the reinforced English type whose sides were splinted by\r\nbrass strips. Not only had the medieval form largely disappeared by the\r\nend of the 18th century, but so had the ancient lever-wedge method of\r\nfastening the bit in the stock, a device replaced by the pressure-spring\r\nbutton on the side of the chuck. Finally, in this evolution, came the\r\nmetallic stock, not widely used in America until after the Civil War,\r\nthat embodied in its design the influence of mass manufacture and in its\r\nseveral early versions all of the features of the modern brace and bit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 47.--18TH CENTURY: The visually pleasing qualities\r\nof walnut and brass provide a level of response to this joiner's bevel\r\nquite apart from its technical significance. (Private collection.\r\nSmithsonian photo 49793-B.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 48.--18TH CENTURY: THE HANDLE OF THE COMPASS SAW,\r\ncharacteristically Dutch in shape, is an outstanding example of a\r\nrecurring functional design, one which varied according to the hand of\r\nthe sawer. (Smithsonian photo 49789-C.)]\r\n\r\nHenry Ward Beecher, impressed by the growing sophistication of the\r\ntoolmakers, described the hand tool in a most realistic and objective\r\nmanner as an \"extension of a man's hand.\" The antiquarian, attuned to\r\nmore subjective and romantic appraisals, will find this hardly\r\nsufficient. Look at the upholsterer's hammer (accession 61.35) seen in\r\nfigure 45: there is no question that it is a response to a demanding\r\ntask that required an efficient and not too forceful extension of the\r\nworkman's hand. But there is another response to this implement: namely,\r\nthe admiration for an unknown toolmaker who combined in an elementary\r\nstriking tool a hammerhead of well-weighted proportion to be wielded\r\ngently through the medium of an extremely delicate handle. In short,\r\nhere is an object about whose provenance one need know very little in\r\norder to enjoy it aesthetically. In a like manner, the 18th-century\r\nbitstock of Flemish origin (fig. 46), the English cabinetmaker's bevel\r\nof the same century (fig. 47), and the compass saw (accession 61.52,\r\nfig. 48) capture in their basic design something beyond the functional\r\nextension of the craftsman's hand. The slow curve of the bitstock, never\r\nidentical from one early example to another, is lost in later\r\nfactory-made versions; so too, with the coming of cheap steel, does the\r\ncombination of wood (walnut) and brass used in the cabinetmaker's bevel\r\nslowly disappear; and, finally, in the custom-fitted pistol-like grip of\r\nthe saw, there is an identity, in feeling at least, between craftsman\r\nand tool never quite achieved in later mass-produced versions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 49.--EARLY 19TH CENTURY: THE DESIGNATION\r\n\"GENTLEMAN'S TOOL CHEST\" required a chest of \"high-style\" but\r\nnecessitated no change in the tools it held.

The\r\nscrewdriver in its early versions frequently had a scalloped blade for\r\nno other purpose than decoration. (Smithsonian photo 49794.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 51.--1870: THE USE of a new material prompted a\r\ndeparture from the traditional in shape and encouraged surface\r\nelaboration. The tendency, however, was short lived and the\r\nmass-produced metallic plane rapidly achieved a purity of design as\r\npleasing as its wooden predecessors. (Private collection. Smithsonian\r\nphoto 49789.)]\r\n\r\nOccasionally, ruling taste is reflected in the design of the carpenter's\r\nequipment. Notable is the \"gentleman's tool chest\" (fig. 49) advertised\r\nin the pattern book of the Castle Hill Works. The bracket feet, brass\r\npulls, and inlaid keyholes imitate the style of the domestic chest of\r\ndrawers of the period 1790 to 1810--undoubtedly, features included by\r\nthe manufacturer to appeal to a gentleman of refined taste. In contrast\r\nto this Sheffield product is the plate from Shaw's _The Modern\r\nArchitect_. The concept of the builder-carpenter as a gentleman still\r\nprevails, although the idea in this American scene is conveyed in the\r\nmid-19th century through fashionable dress. The tools and in particular\r\nthe tool chest reflect only the severest of functional lines (fig. 19,\r\np. 196).\r\n\r\nIn deference to ruling taste, some tools lost for a time the clean lines\r\nthat had long distinguished them. The screwdriver, simple in shape\r\n(accession 61.46) but in little demand until the 1840's, occasionally\r\nbecame most elaborate in its factory-made form (fig. 50) and departed\r\nnoticeably from the unadorned style of traditional English and American\r\ntools. The scalloped blade, influenced by the rival styles rather than a\r\ntechnical need, seemed little related to the purpose of the tool.[10]\r\nNo less archaic in decoration was the iron-bodied version of the plow\r\nplane (fig. 51). The Anglo-American tradition seems completely put\r\naside. In its place is a most functional object, but one elaborately\r\ncovered with a shell and vine motif! Patented in 1870 by Charles Miller\r\nand manufactured by the Stanley Rule and Level Company, this tool in its\r\nunadorned version is of a type that was much admired by the British\r\nexperts at Philadelphia's Centennial Exhibition in 1876. What prompted\r\nsuch superfluous decoration on the plow plane? Perhaps it was to appeal\r\nto the flood of newly arrived American craftsmen who might find in the\r\nrococo something reminiscent of the older tools they had known in\r\nEurope. Perhaps it was simply the transference to the tool itself of the\r\ndecorative work then demanded of the wood craftsmen. Or was it mainly a\r\ncompulsion to dress, with little effort, a lackluster material that\r\nseemed stark and cold to Victorians accustomed to the ornateness being\r\nachieved elsewhere with the jigsaw and wood? Whatever the cause, the\r\nresult did not persist long as a guide to hand-tool design. Instead, the\r\nstrong, plain lines that had evolved over two centuries won universal\r\nendorsement at the Centennial Exhibition. The prize tools reflected\r\nlittle of the ornateness apparent in the wares of most of the other\r\nexhibitors. American makers of edge tools exhibiting at the Centennial\r\nshowed the world not only examples of quality but of attractiveness as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 52.--19TH CENTURY: THE AMERICAN AXE WAS UNEXCELLED\r\nin design and ease of use. European observers praised it as distinctly\r\nAmerican. At the Centennial Exhibition in 1876 Collins and Company of\r\nNew York City was singled out as one of the outstanding manufacturers\r\nexhibiting these axes, a reputation that persisted.

It seems justified to suggest\r\nthat American edge tools displayed at the Centennial had reached their\r\nhigh point of development--a metamorphosis that began with the medieval\r\nEuropean tool forms, moved through a period of reliance on English\r\nprecedents, and ended, in the last quarter of the 19th century, with the\r\nproduction of American hand tools \"occupying an enviable position before\r\nthe world.\"[11]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 54.--1809: THE INTRODUCTION of the gimlet-pointed\r\nauger followed Ezra L'Hommedieu's patent of 1809.

Jennings, U.S. Patent Office, Record Group 241, the\r\nNational Archives.)]\r\n\r\nThe tool most highly praised at Philadelphia was the American felling\r\naxe (fig. 52) \"made out of a solid piece of cast steel\" with the eye\r\n\"punched out of the solid.\" When compared to other forms, the American\r\naxe was \"more easily worked,\" and its shape permitted an easier\r\nwithdrawal after striking.[12]\r\n\r\nSawmakers, too, were singled out for praise--in particular Disston &\r\nSons (fig. 53) for \"improvements in the form of the handles, and in the\r\nmode of fixing them to the saw.\" The Disston saw also embodied an\r\nimproved blade shape which made it \"lighter and more convenient by\r\ngiving it a greater taper to the point.\" Sheffield saws, once supplied\r\nto most of the world, were not exhibited at Philadelphia, and the\r\nBritish expert lamented that our \"monopoly remains with us no\r\nlonger.\"[13]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 56.--1894: THE PERSISTENCE OF \"JENNINGS\" AS A\r\nTRADE NAME is suggested by the vignette from the \"Illustrated Catalogue\"\r\nof Baldwin, Robbins and Company, published in 1894.

The auger had attained a perfection in \"the\r\naccuracy of the twist, the various forms of the cutters, the quality of\r\nthe steel, and fine finish of the twist and polish.\" The ancient pod or\r\nshell auger had nearly disappeared from use, to be replaced by \"the\r\nscrewed form of the tool\" considerably refined by comparison to\r\nL'Hommedieu's prototype, patented in 1809 (fig. 54). Russell Jennings'\r\npatented auger bits (figs. 55-56) were cited for their \"workmanship and\r\nquality,\" and, collectively, the Exhibition \"fully established the\r\nreputation of American augers.\"[14] Likewise, makers of braces and bits\r\nwere commended for the number of excellent examples shown. Some were a\r\ndeparture from the familiar design with \"an expansive chuck for the\r\nbit,\" but others were simply elegant examples of the traditional brace,\r\nin wood, japanned and heavily reinforced with highly polished brass\r\nsidings. An example exhibited by E. Mills and Company, of Philadelphia,\r\nreceived a certification from the judges as being \"of the best quality\r\nand finish\" (fig. 57). The Mills brace, together with other\r\naward-winning tools of the company--drawknives, screwdrivers, and\r\nspokeshaves--is preserved in the collections of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution (accession 319326). Today as a group they confirm \"the\r\nremarkably fine quality of ... both iron and steel\" that characterized\r\nthe manufacture of American edge tools in the second half of the 19th\r\ncentury.[15]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 57.--1876: JAPANNED AND SPLINTED WITH HEAVY BRASS,\r\nthis brace was among the award-winning tools exhibited at the Centennial\r\nby E.

Knowles patented an iron-bodied bench plane that portended a\r\nchange in form that would witness a substitution of steel for wood in\r\nall critical areas of the tool's construction, and easy adjustment of\r\nthe cutting edge by a setscrew, and an increased flexibility that\r\nallowed one plane to be used for several purposes.

In 1876, American planemakers were enthusiastically credited\r\nwith having achieved \"an important change in the structure of the\r\ntool.\"[16] Although change had been suggested by American patentees as\r\nearly as the 1820's, mass production lagged until after the Civil War,\r\nand the use of this new tool form was not widespread outside of the\r\nUnited States. Hazard Knowles of Colchester, Connecticut, in 1827,\r\npatented a plane stock of cast iron which in many respects was a\r\nprototype of later Centennial models (fig. 58).[17] It is evident, even\r\nin its earliest manifestation, that the quest for improvement of the\r\nbench plane did not alter its sound design. In 1857, M.B. Tidey (fig.\r\n59) listed several of the goals that motivated planemakers:\r\n\r\n     First to simplify the manufacturing of planes; second to render\r\n     them more durable; third to retain a uniform mouth; fourth to\r\n     obviate their clogging; and fifth the retention of the essential\r\n     part of the plane when the stock is worn out.[18]\r\n\r\nBy far the greatest number of patents was concerned with perfecting an\r\nadjustable plane iron and methods of constructing the sole of a plane so\r\nthat it would always be \"true.\" Obviously the use of metal rather than\r\nthe older medium, wood, was a natural step, but in the process of\r\nchanging from the wood to the iron-bodied bench plane there were many\r\ntransitional suggestions that combined both materials. Seth Howes of\r\nSouth Chatham, Massachusetts, in U.S. patent 37,694, specified:\r\n\r\n     This invention relates to an improvement in that class of planes\r\n     which are commonly termed \"bench-planes,\" comprising the foreplane,\r\n     smoothing plane, jack plane, jointer, &c.\r\n\r\n     The invention consists in a novel and improved mode of adjusting\r\n     the plane-iron to regulate the depth of the cut of the same, in\r\n     connection with an adjustable cap, all being constructed and\r\n     arranged in such a manner that the plane-iron may be \"set\" with the\r\n     greatest facility and firmly retained in position by the adjustment\r\n     simply of the cap to the plane-iron, after the latter is set, and\r\n     the cap also rendered capable of being adjusted to compensate for\r\n     the wear of the \"sole\" or face of the plane stock.\r\n\r\nThe stock of Howes' plane was wood combined with metal plates, caps, and\r\nscrews. Thomas Worrall of Lowell was issued patent 17,657 for a plane\r\nbased on the same general principle (fig. 60). Worrall claimed in his\r\nspecifications of June 23, 1857:\r\n\r\n     the improved manufacture of [the] carpenter's bench plane or\r\n     jointer as made with its handle, its wooden stock to which said\r\n     handle is affixed, and a separate metallic cutter holder, and\r\n     cutter clamping devices arranged together substantially as\r\n     specified.\r\n\r\nFinally patentees throughout the 19th century, faced with an increasing\r\nproliferation of tool types, frequently sought to perfect multipurpose\r\nimplements of a type best represented later by the ubiquitous Stanley\r\nplane. The evolution of the all-purpose idea, which is incidentally not\r\npeculiar to hand tools alone, can be seen from random statements\r\nselected from U.S. patents for the improvement of bench planes. In 1864\r\nStephen Williams in the specifications of his patent 43,360 stated:\r\n\r\n     I denominate my improvement the \"universal smoothing plane,\"\r\n     because it belongs to that variety of planes in which the face is\r\n     made changeable, so that it may be conveniently adapted to the\r\n     planing of curved as well as straight surfaces. By the use of my\r\n     improvement surfaces that are convex, concave, or straight may be\r\n     easily worked, the face of the tool being readily changed from one\r\n     form to another to suit the surface to which it is to be applied.\r\n\r\nThe announced object of Theodore Duval's improved grooving plane (pat.\r\n97,177) was \"to produce in one tool all that is required to form grooves\r\nof several different widths.\" None was more appealing than Daniel D.\r\nWhitker's saw-rabbet plane (pat. 52,478) which combined \"an adjustable\r\nsaw with an adjustable fence or gage, both being attached to a stock\r\nwith handle similar to a plane, forming together a tool combining the\r\nproperties of the joiner's plow and fillister\" (fig. 61). Nor was\r\nWhitker's idea simply a drawing-board exercise. It was produced\r\ncommercially and was well advertised, as seen in the circular reproduced\r\nin figure 62.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 60.--1857: IN A VARIETY OF ARRANGEMENTS, the\r\naddition of metal plates, caps, and screws at the mouth of the plane, as\r\nshown in Thomas Worrall's drawing, proved a transitional device that\r\npreserved the ancient shape of the tool and slowed the introduction of\r\nbench planes made entirely of iron. (Wash drawing from U.S. Patent\r\nOffice, June 23, 1857, Record Group 241, the National Archives.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 61.--1865: NOT ALL MULTIPURPOSE INNOVATIONS\r\nresulted from the use of new materials. Daniel D. Whitker patented a\r\ncombination saw and rabbet plane little different from one illustrated\r\nby André-Jacob Roubo in his _L'Art du menuisier_ in 1769. (Wash drawing\r\nfrom U.S. Patent Office, October 4, 1865, Record Group 241, the National\r\nArchives.)]\r\n\r\nIn sum, these ideas produced a major break with the traditional shape of\r\nthe bench plane. William Foster in 1843 (pat. 3,355), Birdsill Holly in\r\n1852 (pat. 9,094), and W.S. Loughborough in 1859 (pat. 23,928) are\r\nparticularly good examples of the radical departure from the wooden\r\nblock. And, in the period after the Civil War, C.G. Miller (discussed on\r\np. 213 and in fig. 63), B.A. Blandin (fig. 64), and Russell Phillips\r\n(pat. 106,868) patented multipurpose metallic bench planes of excellent\r\ndesign. It should be pointed out that the patentees mentioned above\r\nrepresent only a few of the great number that tried to improve the\r\nplane. Only the trend of change is suggested by the descriptions and\r\nillustrations presented here. The cumulative effect awaited a showcase,\r\nand the planemakers found it at the Centennial Exhibition of 1876 held\r\nin Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 62.--ABOUT 1865: THE PROGRESS OF AN IDEA from an\r\n18th-century encyclopedia through an American patentee to commercial\r\nreality can be seen in this flier advertising Whitker's saw-rabbet.\r\n(Smithsonian Institution Library. Smithsonian photo 56629.)]\r\n\r\nThe impact of these new planes at the Exhibition caused some\r\nretrospection among the judges:\r\n\r\n     The planes manufactured in Great Britain and in other countries\r\n     fifty years ago were formed of best beech-wood; the plane irons\r\n     were of steel and iron welded together; the jointer plane, about 21\r\n     inches long, was a bulky tool; the jack and hand planes were of the\r\n     same materials. Very little change has been made upon the plane in\r\n     Great Britain, unless in the superior workmanship and higher\r\n     quality of the plane iron.[19]\r\n\r\nThe solid wood-block plane, varying from country to country only in the\r\nstructure of its handles and body decoration, had preserved its\r\nintegrity of design since the Middle Ages. At the Centennial, however,\r\nonly a few examples of the old-type plane were exhibited. A new shape\r\ndominated the cases. Designated by foreign observers as the American\r\nplane, it received extended comment. Here was a tool\r\n\r\n     constructed with a skeleton iron body, having a curved wooden\r\n     handle; the plane iron is of the finest cast-steel; the cover is\r\n     fitted with an ingenious trigger at the top, which, with a screw\r\n     below the iron, admits of the plane iron being removed for\r\n     sharpening and setting without the aid of the hammer, and with the\r\n     greatest ease. The extensive varieties of plane iron in use are\r\n     fitted for every requirement; a very ingenious arrangement is\r\n     applied to the tools for planing the insides of circles or other\r\n     curved works, such as stair-rails, etc. The sole of the plane is\r\n     formed of a plate of tempered steel about the thickness of a\r\n     handsaw, according to the length required, and this plate is\r\n     adapted to the curve, and is securely fixed at each end. With this\r\n     tool the work is not only done better but in less time than\r\n     formerly. In some exhibits the face of the plane was made of beech\r\n     or of other hard wood, secured by screws to the stock, and the tool\r\n     becomes a hybrid, all other parts remaining the same as in the iron\r\n     plane.[20]\r\n\r\nThe popularity of Bailey's patented planes (fig. 65), the type so\r\npraised above, was by no means transitory. In 1884 the Boston firm of\r\nGoodnow & Wightman, \"Importers, Manufacturers and Dealers in Tools of\r\nall kinds,\" illustrated the several planes just described and assured\r\nprospective buyers that\r\n\r\n     These tools meet with universal approbation from the best\r\n     Mechanics. For beauty of style and finish they are unequalled, and\r\n     the great convenience in operating renders them the cheapest Planes\r\n     in use; they are SELF-ADJUSTING in every respect; and each part\r\n     being made INTERCHANGEABLE, can be replaced at a trifling\r\n     expense.[21]\r\n\r\nBy 1900 an advertisement for Bailey's planes published in the catalogue\r\nof another Boston firm, Chandler and Farquhar, indicated that \"over\r\n900,000\" had already been sold.[22]\r\n\r\nOther mass-produced edge tools--axes, adzes, braces and bits, augers,\r\nsaws, and chisels--illustrated in the trade literature of the toolmakers\r\nbecame, as had the iron-bodied bench plane, standard forms. In the last\r\nquarter of the 19th century the tool catalogue replaced Moxon, Duhamel,\r\nDiderot, and the builders' manuals as the primary source for the study\r\nand identification of hand tools. The Centennial had called attention to\r\nthe superiority of certain American tools and toolmakers. The result was\r\nthat until the end of the century, trade literature faithfully drummed\r\nthe products that had proven such \"an attraction to the numerous\r\nartisans who visited the Centennial Exhibition from the United States\r\nand other countries.\"[23]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 63.--1870: THE METALLIC VERSION OF THE PLOW PLANE\r\nlater produced by Stanley and Company was patented by [Charles] G.\r\nMiller as a tool readily \"convertible into a grooving, rabbeting, or\r\nsmoothing plane.\" In production this multipurpose plow gained an\r\nelaborate decoration (fig. 51) nowhere suggested in Miller's\r\nspecification. (Wash drawing from U.S. Patent Office, June 28, 1870,\r\nRecord Group 241, the National Archives.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 64.--1867: THE DRAWING accompanying B.A. Blandin's\r\nspecification for an \"Improvement in Bench Planes\" retained only the\r\nfamiliarly shaped handle or tote of the traditional wood-bodied plane.\r\nThis new shape rapidly became the standard form of the tool with later\r\nvariations chiefly related to the adjustability of the plane-iron and\r\nsole. (Wash drawing from U.S. Patent Office, May 7, 1867, Record Group\r\n241, the National Archives.)]\r\n\r\nCollins and Company of New York City had been given commendation for the\r\nexcellence of their axes; through the end of the century, Collins' brand\r\nfelling axes, broad axes, and adzes were standard items, as witness\r\nHammacher, Schlemmer and Company's catalogue of 1896.[24] Disston saws\r\nwere a byword, and the impact of their exhibit at Philadelphia was still\r\nstrong, as judged from Baldwin, Robbins' catalogue of 1894. Highly\r\nrecommended was the Disston no. 76, the \"Centennial\" handsaw with its\r\n\"skew back\" and \"apple handle.\" Jennings' patented auger bits were\r\nlikewise standard fare in nearly every tool catalogue.[25] So were bench\r\nplanes manufactured by companies that had been cited at Philadelphia for\r\nthe excellence of their product; namely, The Metallic Plane Company,\r\nAuburn, New York; The Middletown Tool Company, Middletown, Connecticut;\r\nBailey, Leonard, and Company, Hartford; and The Sandusky Tool Company,\r\nSandusky, Ohio.[26]\r\n\r\nAn excellent indication of the persistence of the Centennial influence,\r\nand of the tool catalogue as source material, is seen in Chandler and\r\nFarquhar's illustrated pamphlet of 1900. Their advertisement for\r\nBarber's improved ratchet brace (fig. 66), a tool much admired by the\r\nCentennial judges, amply illustrates the evolution of design of a basic\r\nimplement present in American society since the first years of\r\nsettlement. The Barber brace represents the ultimate sophistication of a\r\ntool, achieved through an expanded industrial technology rather than by\r\nan extended or newly found use for the device itself. It is a prime\r\nexample of the transition of a tool from Moxon to its perfected form in\r\nthe 20th century:\r\n\r\n     These Braces possess the following points of superiority: The Sweep\r\n     is made from Steel; the Jaws are forged from Steel; the Wood Handle\r\n     has brass rings inserted in each end so it cannot split off; the\r\n     Chuck has a hardened Steel antifriction washer between the two\r\n     sockets, thus reducing the wear. The Head has a bearing of steel\r\n     balls, running on hard steel plates, so no wear can take place, as\r\n     the friction is reduced to the minimum. The Brace is heavily\r\n     nickel-plated and warranted in every particular. We endeavor to\r\n     make these goods as nearly perfection as is possible in durability,\r\n     quality of material and workmanship, and fineness and beauty of\r\n     finish.[27]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 65.--1900: AMERICAN PLANEMAKERS had been cited at\r\nthe Philadelphia Centennial as having introduced a dramatic change in\r\nthe nature of the tool. Although wood-bodied planes continued to be\r\nused, they were outdated and in fact anachronistic by the close of the\r\n19th century. From the 1870's forward, it was the iron-bodied plane,\r\nmost frequently Bailey's, that enlivened the trade literature.\r\n(Catalogue of Chandler and Farquhar, Boston, 1900. Smithsonian photo\r\n55798.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 66.--1900: FEW TOOLS SUGGEST MORE CLEARLY the\r\ninfluence of modern industrial society upon the design and construction\r\nof traditional implements than Barber's ratchet brace. It is not without\r\ninterest that as the tools of the wood craftsman became crisply\r\nefficient, his work declined correspondingly in individuality and\r\ncharacter. The brace and the plane, as followed from Moxon through the\r\ntrade literature of the late 19th century, achieved perfection in form\r\nand operation at a time when their basic functions had been usurped by\r\nmachines. (Catalogue of Chandler and Farquhar, Boston, 1900. Smithsonian\r\nphoto 56626.)]\r\n\r\nThe description of Barber's brace documents a major technical change:\r\nwood to steel, leather washers to ball bearings, and natural patina to\r\nnickel plate. It is also an explanation for the appearance and shape of\r\ncraftmen's tools, either hand forged or mass produced. In each case, the\r\nsought-after result in the form of a finished product has been an\r\nimplement of \"fineness and beauty.\" This quest motivated three centuries\r\nof toolmakers and brought vitality to hand-tool design. Moxon had\r\nadvised:\r\n\r\n  He that will a good Edge win,\r\n  Must Forge thick and Grind thin.[28]\r\n\r\nIf heeded, the result would be an edge tool that assured its owner \"ease\r\nand delight.\"[29] Throughout the period considered here, the most\r\npraiseworthy remarks made about edge tools were variations of either\r\n\"unsurpassed in quality, finish, and beauty of style\" or, more simply,\r\ncommendation for \"excellent design and superior workmanship.\"[30] The\r\nhand tool thus provoked the same value words in the 19th as in the 17th\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe aesthetics of industrial art, whether propounded by Moxon or by an\r\nofficial at the Philadelphia Centennial, proved the standard measure by\r\nwhich quality could be judged. Today these values are particularly valid\r\nwhen applied to a class of artifacts that changed slowly and have as\r\ntheir prime characteristics anonymity of maker and date. With such\r\nobjects the origin, transition, and variation of shape are of primary\r\ninterest. Consider the common auger whose \"Office\" Moxon declared \"is to\r\nmake great round holes\" and whose importance was so clearly stressed at\r\nPhiladelphia in 1876.[31] Neither its purpose nor its gross appearance\r\n(a T-handled boring tool) had changed. The tool did, however, develop\r\nqualitatively through 200 years, from a pod or shell to a spiral bit,\r\nfrom a blunt to a gimlet point, and from a hand-fashioned to a\r\ngeometrically exact, factory-made implement: innovations associated with\r\nCooke (1770), L'Hommedieu (1809), and Jennings (1850's). In each\r\ninstance the tool was improved--a double spiral facilitated the\r\ndischarge of shavings, a gimlet point allowed the direct insertion of\r\nthe auger, and machine precision brought mathematical accuracy to the\r\ndegree of twist. Still, overall appearance did not change. At the\r\nCentennial, Moxon would have recognized an auger, and, further, his\r\nlecture on its uses would have been singularly current. The large-bore\r\nspiral auger still denoted a mortise, tenon, and trenail mode of\r\nbuilding in a wood-based technology; at the same time its near cousin,\r\nthe wheelwright's reamer, suggested the reliance upon a transport\r\ndependent upon wooden hubs. The auger in its perfected form--fine steel,\r\nperfectly machined, and highly finished--contrasted with an auger of\r\nearlier vintage will clearly show the advance from forge to factory, but\r\nwill indicate little new in its method of use or its intended purpose.\r\n\r\nPersons neither skilled in the use of tools nor interested in technical\r\nhistory will find that there is another response to the common auger, as\r\nthere was to the upholsterer's hammer, the 18th-century brace, or the\r\nsaw with the custom-fitted grip. This is a subjective reaction to a\r\npleasing form. It is the same reaction that prompted artists to use\r\ntools as vehicles to help convey lessons in perspective, a frequent\r\npractice in 19th-century art manuals. The harmony of related parts--the\r\nbalance of shaft and handle or the geometry of the twist--makes the\r\nauger a decorative object. This is not to say that the ancient\r\nwoodworker's tool is not a document attesting a society's technical\r\nproficiency--ingenuity, craftsmanship, and productivity. It is only to\r\nsuggest again that it is something more; a survival of the past whose\r\nintrinsic qualities permit it to stand alone as a bridge between the\r\ncraftsman's hand and his work; an object of considerable appeal in which\r\nintegrity of line and form is not dimmed by the skill of the user nor by\r\nthe quality of the object produced by it.\r\n\r\nIn America, this integrity of design is derived from three centuries of\r\nexperience: one of heterogeneous character, the mid-17th to the\r\nmid-18th; one of predominately English influence, from 1750 to 1850; and\r\none that saw the perfection of basic tools, by native innovators,\r\nbetween 1850 and the early 20th century. In the two earlier periods, the\r\nwoodworking tool and the products it finished had a natural affinity\r\nowing largely to the harmony of line that both the tool and finished\r\nproduct shared. The later period, however, presents a striking contrast.\r\nHand-tool design, with few exceptions, continued vigorous and functional\r\namidst the confusion of an eclectic architecture, a flurry of rival\r\nstyles, the horrors of the jigsaw, and the excesses of Victorian taste.\r\nIn conclusion, it would seem that whether seeking some continuous thread\r\nin the evolution of a national style, or whether appraising American\r\ncontributions to technology, such a search must rest, at least in part,\r\nupon the character and quality of the hand tools the society has made\r\nand used, because they offer a continuity largely unknown to other\r\nclasses of material survivals.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] W.M.
