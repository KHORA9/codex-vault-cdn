It was thought that I might thus\r\ncontribute towards a more intimate knowledge of the glorious heritage\r\nour forefathers have bequeathed to us, than the greater number of them\r\npossess, and towards helping them to understand the characteristics\r\nand requirements of the numerous and widely different races by whom\r\nIndia is inhabited.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for people who know nothing of Natives to understand\r\nand appreciate the value they set on cherished customs, peculiar\r\nidiosyncrasies, and fixed prejudices, all of which must be carefully\r\nstudied by those who are placed in the position of their Rulers, if\r\nthe suzerain Power is to keep their respect and gain their gratitude\r\nand affection.\r\n\r\nThe Natives of India are particularly observant of character, and\r\nintelligent in gauging the capabilities of those who govern them; and\r\nit is because the English Government is trusted that a mere handful\r\nof Englishmen are able to direct the administration of a country with\r\nnearly three hundred millions of inhabitants, differing in race,\r\nreligion, and manners of life. Throughout all the changes which India\r\nhas undergone, political and social, during the present century, this\r\nfeeling has been maintained, and it will last so long as the services\r\nare filled by honourable men who sympathize with the Natives, respect\r\ntheir prejudices, and do not interfere unnecessarily with their habits\r\nand customs.\r\n\r\nMy father and I spent between us nearly ninety years in India. The\r\nmost wonderful of the many changes that took place during that time\r\nmay be said to date from the Mutiny. I have endeavoured in the\r\nfollowing pages to explain the causes which, I believe, brought\r\nabout that terrible event--an event which for a while produced a\r\nmuch-to-be-regretted feeling of racial antagonism. Happily, this\r\nfeeling did not last long; even when things looked blackest for us, it\r\nwas softened by acts of kindness shown to Europeans in distress, and\r\nby the knowledge that, but for the assistance afforded by the Natives\r\nthemselves, the restoration of order, and the suppression of a fierce\r\nmilitary insurrection, would have been a far more arduous task. Delhi\r\ncould not have been taken without Sikhs and Gurkhas; Lucknow could\r\nnot have been defended without the Hindustani soldiers who so nobly\r\nresponded to Sir Henry Lawrence's call; and nothing that Sir John\r\nLawrence might have done could have prevented our losing, for a time,\r\nthe whole of the country north of Calcutta, had not the men of the\r\nPunjab and the Derajat[*] remained true to our cause.\r\n\r\n[Note *: Tracts beyond the Indus.]\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that all outward signs of the Mutiny should\r\nbe obliterated, that the monument on the Ridge at Delhi should be\r\nlevelled, and the picturesque Residency at Lucknow allowed to fall\r\ninto decay. This view does not commend itself to me. These relics of\r\nthat tremendous struggle are memorials of heroic services performed\r\nby Her Majesty's soldiers, Native as well as British; and by the\r\ncivilians who shared the duties and dangers of the army. They are\r\nvaluable as reminders that we must never again allow ourselves to be\r\nlulled into fancied security; and above all, they stand as warnings\r\nthat we should never do anything that can possibly be interpreted by\r\nthe Natives into disregard for their various forms of religion.\r\n\r\nThe Mutiny was not an unmitigated evil, for to it we owe the\r\nconsolidation of our power in India, as it hastened on the\r\nconstruction of the roads, railways, and telegraphs, so wisely and\r\nthoughtfully planned by the Marquis of Dalhousie, and which have\r\ndone more than anything to increase the prosperity of the people and\r\npreserve order throughout the country. It was the Mutiny which brought\r\nLord Canning into closer communication with the Princes of India, and\r\npaved the way for Lord Lytton's brilliant conception of the Imperial\r\nAssemblage--a great political success which laid the foundation of\r\nthat feeling of confidence which now, happily, exists between the\r\nRuling Chiefs and the Queen-Empress. And it was the Mutiny which\r\ncompelled us to reorganize our Indian Army and make it the admirable\r\nfighting machine it now is.\r\n\r\nIn the account I have given of our relations with Afghanistan and\r\nthe border tribes, I have endeavoured to bring before my readers\r\nthe change of our position in India that has been the inevitable\r\nconsequence of the propinquity upon our North-West Frontier of a\r\nfirst-class European Power. The change has come about so gradually,\r\nand has been so repeatedly pronounced to be chimerical by authorities\r\nin whom the people of Great Britain had every reason to feel\r\nconfidence, that until recently it had attracted little public\r\nattention, and even now a great majority of my countrymen may scarcely\r\nhave realized the probability of England and Russia ever being near\r\nenough to each other in Asia to come into actual conflict. I impute no\r\nblame to the Russians for their advance towards India. The force of\r\ncircumstances--the inevitable result of the contact of civilization\r\nwith barbarism--impelled them to cross the Jaxartes and extend their\r\nterritories to the Khanates of Turkestan and the banks of the Oxus,\r\njust as the same uncontrollable force carried us across the Sutlej and\r\nextended our territories to the valley of the Indus. The object I have\r\nat heart is to make my fellow-subjects recognize that, under these\r\naltered conditions, Great Britain now occupies in Asia the position of\r\na Continental Power, and that her interests in that part of the globe\r\nmust be protected by Continental means of defence.\r\n\r\nThe few who have carefully and steadily watched the course of events,\r\nentertained no doubt from the first as to the soundness of these\r\nviews; and their aim has always been, as mine is now, not to sound an\r\nalarm, but to give a warning, and to show the danger of shutting our\r\neyes to plain facts and their probable consequences.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the future course of events, I have no fear of the\r\nresult if we are only true to ourselves and to India. Thinking Natives\r\nthoroughly understand the situation; they believe that the time must\r\ncome when the territories of Great Britain and Russia in their part of\r\nAsia will be separated only by a common boundary line, and they would\r\nconsider that we were wanting in the most essential attributes of\r\nRulers if we did not take all possible precautions, and make every\r\npossible preparation to meet such an eventuality.\r\n\r\nI send out this book in the earnest hope that the friendly\r\nanticipations of those who advised me to write it may not be seriously\r\ndisappointed; and that those who care to read a plain, unvarnished\r\ntale of Indian life and adventure, will bear in mind that the writer\r\nis a soldier, not a man of letters, and will therefore forgive all\r\nfaults of style or language.\r\n\r\nROBERTS.\r\n\r\n_30th September_, 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KASHMIR GATE AT

Under the regulations then in\r\nforce, leave, except on medical certificate, could only be obtained\r\nonce during the whole of an officer's service, and ten years had to be\r\nspent in India before that leave could be taken. Small wonder, then,\r\nthat I felt as if I were bidding England farewell for ever when, on\r\nthe 20th February, 1852, I set sail from Southampton with Calcutta for\r\nmy destination. Steamers in those days ran to and from India but once\r\na month, and the fleet employed was only capable of transporting some\r\n2,400 passengers in the course of a year. This does not include the\r\nCape route; but even taking that into consideration, I should doubt\r\nwhether there were then as many travellers to India in a year as there\r\nare now in a fortnight at the busy season.\r\n\r\nMy ship was the Peninsular and Oriental Company's steamer _Ripon_,\r\ncommanded by Captain Moresby, an ex-officer of the Indian Navy, in\r\nwhich he had earned distinction by his survey of the Red Sea. A few\r\nAddiscombe friends were on board, leaving England under the same\r\ndepressing circumstances as myself, and what with wind and weather,\r\nand the thought that at the best we were bidding farewell to home and\r\nrelations for ten long years, we were anything but a cheerful party\r\nfor the first few days of the voyage. Youth and high spirits had,\r\nhowever, re-asserted themselves long before Alexandria, which place\r\nwe reached without incident beyond the customary halts for coaling at\r\nGibraltar and Malta. At Alexandria we bade adieu to Captain Moresby,\r\nwho had been most kind and attentive, and whose graphic accounts\r\nof the difficulties he had had to overcome whilst mastering the\r\nnavigation of the Red Sea served to while away many a tedious hour.\r\n\r\nOn landing at Alexandria, we were hurried on board a large mast-less\r\ncanal boat, shaped like a Nile dahabeah. In this we were towed up the\r\nMahmoudieh canal for ten hours, until we arrived at Atfieh, on the\r\nNile; thence we proceeded by steamer, reaching Cairo in about sixteen\r\nhours. Here we put up at Shepherd's Hotel for a couple of days, which\r\nwere most enjoyable, especially to those of the party who, like\r\nmyself, saw an eastern city and its picturesque and curious bazaars\r\nfor the first time. From Cairo the route lay across the desert for\r\nninety miles, the road being merely a cutting in the sand, quite\r\nundistinguishable at night. The journey was performed in a conveyance\r\nclosely resembling a bathing-machine, which accommodated six people,\r\nand was drawn by four mules. My five fellow-travellers were all\r\ncadets, only one of whom (Colonel John Stewart, of Ardvorlich,\r\nPerthshire) is now alive. The transit took some eighteen hours, with\r\nan occasional halt for refreshments. Our baggage was carried on\r\ncamels, as were the mails, cargo, and even the coal for the Red Sea\r\nsteamers.\r\n\r\nOn arrival at Suez we found awaiting us the _Oriental_, commanded by\r\nCaptain Powell. A number of people met us there who had left England\r\na month before we did; but their steamer having broken down, they had\r\nnow to be accommodated on board ours. We were thus very inconveniently\r\ncrowded until we arrived at Aden, where several of the passengers left\r\nus for Bombay. We were not, however, much inclined to complain, as\r\nsome of our new associates proved themselves decided acquisitions.\r\nAmongst them was Mr. (afterwards Sir Barnes) Peacock, an immense\r\nfavourite with all on board, and more particularly with us lads. He\r\nwas full of fun, and although then forty-seven years old, and on his\r\nway to Calcutta to join the Governor-General's Council, he took part\r\nin our amusements as if he were of the same age as ourselves. His\r\ncareer in India was brilliant, and on the expiration of his term of\r\noffice as member of Council he was made Chief Justice of Bengal.\r\nAnother of the passengers was Colonel (afterwards Sir John Bloomfield)\r\nGough, who died not long ago in Ireland, and was then on his way to\r\ntake up his appointment as Quartermaster-General of Queen's troops. He\r\nhad served in the 3rd Light Dragoons and on the staff of his cousin,\r\nLord Gough, during the Sutlej and Punjab campaigns, and was naturally\r\nan object of the deepest veneration to all the youngsters on board.\r\n\r\nAt Madras we stopped to land passengers, and I took this opportunity\r\nof going on shore to see some old Addiscombe friends, most of whom\r\nwere greatly excited at the prospect of a war in Burma. The transports\r\nwere then actually lying in the Madras roads, and a few days later\r\nthis portion of the expedition started for Rangoon.\r\n\r\nAt last, on the 1st April, we reached Calcutta, and I had to say\r\ngood-bye to the friends I had made during the six weeks' voyage, most\r\nof whom I was never to meet again.\r\n\r\nOn landing, I received a letter from my father, who commanded the\r\nLahore division, informing me that the proprietor of Spence's Hotel\r\nhad been instructed to receive me, and that I had better put up there\r\nuntil I reported myself at the Head-Quarters of the Bengal Artillery\r\nat Dum-Dum. This was chilling news, for I was the only one of our\r\nparty who had to go to a hotel on landing. The Infantry cadets had\r\neither been taken charge of by the Town Major, who provided them with\r\nquarters in Fort William, or had gone to stay with friends, and the\r\nonly other Artilleryman (Stewart) went direct to Dum-Dum, where he\r\nhad a brother, also a gunner, who, poor follow, was murdered with his\r\nyoung wife five years later by the mutineers at Gwalior. I was still\r\nmore depressed later on by finding myself at dinner _tête-à-tête_\r\nwith a first-class specimen of the results of an Indian climate.\r\nHe belonged to my own regiment, and was going home on medical\r\ncertificate, but did not look as if he could ever reach England. He\r\ngave me the not too pleasing news that by staying in that dreary\r\nhotel, instead of proceeding direct to Dum-Dum, I had lost a day's\r\nservice and pay, so I took care to join early the following morning.\r\n\r\nA few years before, Dum-Dum had been a large military station, but\r\nthe annexation of the Punjab, and the necessity for maintaining\r\na considerable force in northern India, had greatly reduced the\r\ngarrison. Even the small force that remained had embarked for Burma\r\nbefore my arrival, so that, instead of a large, cheery mess party, to\r\nwhich I had been looking forward, I sat down to dinner with only one\r\nother subaltern.\r\n\r\nNo time was lost in appointing me to a Native Field Battery, and I\r\nwas put through the usual laboratory course as a commencement to my\r\nduties. The life was dull in the extreme, the only variety being an\r\noccasional week in Fort William, where my sole duty was to superintend\r\nthe firing of salutes. Nor was there much in my surroundings to\r\ncompensate for the prosaic nature of my work. Fort William was not\r\nthen what it has since become--one of the healthiest stations\r\nin India. Quite the contrary. The men were crowded into small\r\nbadly-ventilated buildings, and the sanitary arrangements were as\r\ndeplorable as the state of the water supply. The only efficient\r\nscavengers were the huge birds of prey called adjutants, and so\r\ngreat was the dependence placed upon the exertions of these unclean\r\ncreatures, that the young cadets were warned that any injury done to\r\nthem would be treated as gross misconduct. The inevitable result of\r\nthis state of affairs was endemic sickness, and a death-rate of over\r\nten per cent. per annum.[1]\r\n\r\nCalcutta outside the Fort was but a dreary place to fall back upon. It\r\nwas wretchedly lighted by smoky oil-lamps set at very rare intervals.\r\nThe slow and cumbrous palankin was the ordinary means of conveyance,\r\nand, as far as I was concerned, the vaunted hospitality of the\r\nAnglo-Indian was conspicuous by its absence.\r\n\r\nI must confess I was disappointed at being left so completely to\r\nmyself, especially by the senior military officers, many of whom were\r\npersonally known to my father, who had, I was aware, written to some\r\nof them on my behalf. Under these circumstances, I think it is hardly\r\nto be wondered at that I became terribly home-sick, and convinced\r\nthat I could never be happy in India. Worst of all, the prospects of\r\npromotion seemed absolutely hopeless; I was a supernumerary Second\r\nLieutenant, and nearly every officer in the list of the Bengal\r\nArtillery had served over fifteen years as a subaltern. This\r\nstagnation extended to every branch of the Indian Army.\r\n\r\nThere were singularly few incidents to enliven this unpromising stage\r\nof my career. I do, however, remember one rather notable experience\r\nwhich came to me at that time, in the form of a bad cyclone. I was\r\ndining out on the night in question. Gradually the wind grew higher\r\nand higher, and it became evident that we were in for a storm of no\r\nordinary kind. Consequently, I left my friend's house early. A Native\r\nservant, carrying a lantern, accompanied me to light me on my way. At\r\nan angle of the road a sudden gust of wind extinguished the light. The\r\nservant, who, like most Natives, was quite at home in the dark, walked\r\non, believing that I was following in his wake. I shouted to him as\r\nloudly as I could, but the uproar was so terrific that he could not\r\nhear a word, and there was nothing for it but to try and make my own\r\nway home. The darkness was profound. As I was walking carefully along,\r\nI suddenly came in contact with an object, which a timely flash of\r\nlightning showed me was a column, standing in exactly the opposite\r\ndirection from my own house. I could now locate myself correctly, and\r\nthe lightning becoming every moment more vivid, I was enabled to grope\r\nmy way by slow degrees to the mess, where I expected to find someone\r\nto show me my way home, but the servants, who knew from experience the\r\nprobable effects of a cyclone, had already closed the outside Venetian\r\nshutters and barred all the doors. I could just see them through the\r\ncracks engaged in making everything fast. In vain I banged at the door\r\nand called at the top of my voice--they heard nothing. Reluctantly I\r\nbecame convinced that there was no alternative but to leave my shelter\r\nand face the rapidly increasing storm once more. My bungalow was not\r\nmore than half a mile away, but it took me an age to accomplish this\r\nshort distance, as I was only able to move a few steps at a time\r\nwhenever the lightning showed me the way. It was necessary to be\r\ncareful, as the road was raised, with a deep ditch on either side;\r\nseveral trees had already been blown down, and lay across it, and huge\r\nbranches were being driven through the air like thistle-down. I found\r\nextreme difficulty in keeping my feet, especially at the cross-roads,\r\nwhere I was more than once all but blown over. At last I reached my\r\nhouse, but even then my struggles were not quite at an end. It was a\r\nvery long time before I could gain admittance. The servant who had\r\nbeen carrying the lantern had arrived, and, missing me, imagined that\r\nI must have returned to the house at which I had dined. The men with\r\nwhom I chummed, thinking it unlikely that I should make a second\r\nattempt to return home, had carefully fastened all the doors,\r\nmomentarily expecting the roof of the house to be blown off. I had to\r\ncontinue hammering and shouting for a long time before they heard and\r\nadmitted me, thankful to be comparatively safe inside a house.\r\n\r\nBy morning the worst of the storm was over, but not before great\r\ndamage had been done. The Native bazaar was completely wrecked,\r\nlooking as if it had suffered a furious bombardment, and great havoc\r\nhad been made amongst the European houses, not a single verandah or\r\noutside shutter being left in the station. As I walked to the mess, I\r\nfound the road almost impassable from fallen trees; and dead birds,\r\nchiefly crows and kites, were so numerous that they had to be carried\r\noff in cartloads. How I had made my way to my bungalow without\r\naccident the night before was difficult to imagine. Even the column\r\nagainst which I had stumbled was levelled by the fury of the blast.\r\nThis column had been raised a few years before to the memory of\r\nthe officers and men of the 1st Troop, 1st Brigade, Bengal Horse\r\nArtillery, who were killed in the disastrous retreat from Kabul in\r\n1841. It was afterwards rebuilt.\r\n\r\nDum-Dum in ruins was even more dreary than before the cyclone, and I\r\nfelt as if I could not possibly continue to live there much longer.\r\nAccordingly I wrote to my father, begging him to try and get me sent\r\nto Burma; but he replied that he hoped soon to get command of the\r\nPeshawar division, and that he would then like me to join him. Thus,\r\nthough my desire to quit Dum-Dum was not to be immediately gratified,\r\nI was buoyed up by the hope that a definite limit had now been placed\r\nto my service in that, to me, uninteresting part of India, and my\r\nrestlessness and discontent disappeared as if by magic.\r\n\r\nIn time of peace, as in war, or during a cholera epidemic, a soldier's\r\nmoral condition is infinitely more important than his physical\r\nsurroundings, and it is in this respect, I think, that the subaltern\r\nof the present day has an advantage over the youngster of forty years\r\nago. The life of a young officer during his first few months of exile,\r\nbefore he has fallen into the ways of his new life and made friends\r\nfor himself, can never be very happy; but in these days he is\r\nencouraged by the feeling that, however distasteful, it need not\r\nnecessarily last very long; and he can look forward to a rapid and\r\neasy return to England and friends at no very distant period. At the\r\ntime I am writing of he could not but feel completely cut off from all\r\nthat had hitherto formed his chief interests in life--his family\r\nand his friends--for ten years is an eternity to the young, and the\r\nfeeling of loneliness and home-sickness was apt to become almost\r\ninsupportable.\r\n\r\nThe climate added its depressing influence; there was no going to the\r\nhills then, and as the weary months dragged on, the young stranger\r\nbecame more and more dispirited and hopeless. Such was my case. I had\r\nonly been four months in India, but it seemed like four years. My joy,\r\ntherefore, was unbounded when at last my marching orders arrived.\r\nIndeed, the idea that I was about to proceed to that grand field of\r\nsoldierly activity, the North-West Frontier, and there join my father,\r\nalmost reconciled me to the disappointment of losing my chance of\r\nfield service in Burma. My arrangements were soon made, and early in\r\nAugust I bade a glad good-bye to Dum-Dum.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In the fifty-seven years preceding the Mutiny the annual\r\nrate of mortality amongst the European troops in India was sixty-nine\r\nper thousand, and in some stations it was even more appalling. The\r\nRoyal Commission appointed in 1864 to inquire into the sanitary\r\ncondition of the army in India expressed the hope that, by taking\r\nproper precautions, the mortality might be reduced to the rate of\r\ntwenty per thousand per annum. I am glad to say that this hope has\r\nbeen more than realized, the annual death-rate since 1882 having never\r\nrisen to seventeen per thousand.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n1852\r\n\r\nBengal Horse Artillery--Incidents of the journey--New Friends\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I went to India the mode of travelling was almost as primitive\r\nas it had been a hundred, and probably five hundred, years before.\r\nPrivate individuals for the most part used palankins, while officers,\r\nregiments, and drafts were usually sent up country by the river route\r\nas far as Cawnpore. It was necessarily a slow mode of progression--how\r\nslow may be imagined from the fact that it took me nearly three months\r\nto get from Dum-Dum to Peshawar, a distance now traversed with the\r\ngreatest ease and comfort in as many days. As far as Benares I\r\ntravelled in a barge towed by a steamer--a performance which took the\r\nbest part of a month to accomplish. From Benares to Allahabad it was a\r\npleasant change to get upon wheels, a horse-dâk having been recently\r\nestablished between these two places. At Allahabad I was most kindly\r\nreceived by Mr. Lowther, the Commissioner, an old friend of my\r\nfather's, in whose house I experienced for the first time that profuse\r\nhospitality for which Anglo-Indians are proverbial. I was much\r\nsurprised and amused by the circumstance of my host smoking a _hookah_\r\neven at meals, for he was one of the few Englishmen who still indulged\r\nin that luxury, as it was then considered. The sole duty of one\r\nservant, called the _hookah-bardar_, was to prepare the pipe for his\r\nmaster, and to have it ready at all times.\r\n\r\nMy next resting-place was Cawnpore, my birthplace, where I remained\r\na few days. The Cawnpore division was at that time commanded by an\r\nofficer of the name of Palmer, who had only recently attained the\r\nrank of Brigadier-General, though he could not have been less than\r\nsixty-eight years of age, being of the same standing as my father.\r\n\r\nFrom Cawnpore I went to Meerut, and there came across, for the first\r\ntime, the far-famed Bengal Horse Artillery, and made the acquaintance\r\nof a set of officers who more than realized my expectations regarding\r\nthe wearers of the much-coveted jacket, association with whom created\r\nin me a fixed resolve to leave no stone unturned in the endeavour to\r\nbecome a horse gunner. Like the Cavalry and Infantry of the East India\r\nCompany's service, the Artillery suffered somewhat from the employment\r\nof many of its best officers on the staff and in civil appointments;\r\nthe officers selected were not seconded or replaced in their\r\nregiments. This was the case in a less degree, no doubt, in the Horse\r\nArtillery than in the other branches, for its _esprit_ was great, and\r\nofficers were proud to belong to this _corps d'élite_. It certainly\r\nwas a splendid service; the men were the pick of those recruited by\r\nthe East India Company, they were of magnificent physique, and their\r\nuniform was singularly handsome. The jacket was much the same as that\r\nnow worn by the Royal Horse Artillery, but instead of the busby they\r\nhad a brass helmet covered in front with leopard skin, surmounted by\r\na long red plume which drooped over the back like that of a French\r\nCuirassier. This, with white buckskin breeches and long boots,\r\ncompleted a uniform which was one of the most picturesque and\r\neffective I have ever seen on a parade-ground.\r\n\r\nThe metalled highway ended at Meerut, and I had to perform the\r\nremainder of my journey to Peshawar, a distance of 600 miles, in a\r\npalankin, or doolie.\r\n\r\nThis manner of travelling was tedious in the extreme. Starting after\r\ndinner, the victim was carried throughout the night by eight men,\r\ndivided into reliefs of four. The whole of the eight were changed at\r\nstages averaging from ten to twelve miles apart. The baggage was\r\nalso conveyed by coolies, who kept up an incessant chatter, and the\r\nprocession was lighted on its way by a torch-bearer, whose torch\r\nconsisted of bits of rag tied round the end of a stick, upon which\r\nhe continually poured the most malodorous of oils. If the\r\npalankin-bearers were very good, they shuffled along at the rate of\r\nabout three miles an hour, and if there were no delays, forty or\r\nforty-five miles could be accomplished before it became necessary to\r\nseek shelter from the sun in one of the dâk-bungalows, or rest-houses,\r\nerected by Government at convenient intervals along all the principal\r\nroutes. In these bungalows a bath could be obtained, and sorely it was\r\nneeded after a journey of thirteen or fourteen hours at a level of\r\nonly a few inches above an exceedingly dusty road. As to food, the\r\n_khansamah_, like 'mine host' in the old country, declared himself\r\nat the outset prepared to provide everything the heart of man could\r\ndesire; when, however, the traveller was safely cornered for the rest\r\nof the day, the _menu_ invariably dwindled down to the elementary\r\nand universal 'sudden death,' which meant a wretchedly thin chicken,\r\ncaught, decapitated, grilled, and served up within twenty minutes of\r\nthe meal being ordered. At dinner a variety was made by the chicken\r\nbeing curried, accompanied by an unlimited supply of rice and chutney.\r\n\r\nI was glad to be able to break the monotony of this long journey by\r\na visit to a half-sister of mine, who was then living at the\r\nhill-station of Mussoorie. The change to the delightful freshness of a\r\nHimalayan climate after the Turkish-bath-like atmosphere of the plains\r\nin September was most grateful, and I thoroughly enjoyed the few days\r\nI spent in the midst of the lovely mountain scenery.\r\n\r\nMy next station was Umballa. There I fell in with two other troops of\r\nHorse Artillery, and became more than ever enamoured with the idea of\r\nbelonging to so splendid a service. From Umballa it was a two nights'\r\njourney to Ludhiana, where I rested for the day, and there met a\r\ncousin in the Survey Department, who had been suddenly ordered to\r\nLahore, so we agreed to travel together.\r\n\r\nThe next halting-place was Jullundur. To make a change, we hired a\r\nbuggy at this place, in which to drive the first stage, sending our\r\npalankins on ahead; when we overtook them, we found, to our surprise,\r\nthat their number had increased to six. We were preparing for a start,\r\nwhen it struck us that we ought to make some inquiries about the\r\nadditional four, which, from the luggage lying about, we assumed to\r\nbe occupied, but which appeared to be stranded for want of bearers to\r\ncarry them on. The doors were carefully closed, and it was some time\r\nbefore we could get an answer to our offers of assistance. Eventually\r\na lady looked out, and told us that she and a friend, each accompanied\r\nby two children and an _ayah_,[1] were on their way to Lahore; that\r\nthe bearers who had brought them so far had run away, and that they\r\nwere absolutely in despair as to how they were to proceed. It turned\r\nout that the bearers, who had been engaged to carry the ladies on\r\nthe second stage towards Lahore, found it more amusing to attend the\r\nceremony of the installation of the Raja of Kaparthala, then going on,\r\nthan to fulfil their engagement. After discussing the situation, the\r\nladies were persuaded to get out of their palankins and into our\r\nbuggy. We divided the baggage and six doolies between our sixteen\r\nbearers, and started off, my cousin, the _ayahs_, and I on foot. It\r\nwas then 10 p.m. We hoped relays of bearers for the whole party\r\nwould be forthcoming at the next stage, but we were doomed to\r\ndisappointment. Our reliefs were present, but none for the ladies.\r\nWe succeeded, however, in inducing our original bearers to come on a\r\nfurther stage, thus arranging for the carriage of the _ayahs_, while\r\nwe two men trudged on beside the buggy for another ten or twelve\r\nmiles. It was a heavy, sandy road, and three stages were about as much\r\nas the horse could manage.\r\n\r\nSoon after daybreak next morning we reached the Bias river. Crossing\r\nby a bridge of boats, we found on the other side a small one-roomed\r\nhouse with a verandah running round it, built for the use of the\r\nEuropean overseer in charge of the road. On matters being explained,\r\nthis man agreed to turn out. The ladies and children were put inside,\r\nand my cousin and I spent the day in the verandah; in the evening,\r\nwith the assistance of the overseer, we were able to get a sufficient\r\nnumber of bearers to carry us all on to Mian Mir without further\r\nadventure. In the course of conversation we found that one of the\r\nladies was the wife of Lieutenant Donald Stewart,[2] of the 9th Bengal\r\nInfantry, and that she and her friend were returning to join their\r\nrespective husbands after spending the summer months at Simla. This\r\nmeeting was the beginning of a close friendship with Sir Donald and\r\nLady Stewart, which has lasted to the present day.\r\n\r\nAt Mian Mir (the military cantonment of Lahore) I stayed a few days\r\nwith another half-sister, and from there, as the weather was beginning\r\nto get cooler, I travelled day and night. One evening about eight\r\no'clock I was disappointed at not having come across the usual\r\nrest-house; lights could be seen, however, at no great distance, and\r\nI proceeded towards them; they turned out to be the camp fires of a\r\nCavalry regiment which was halting there for the night. Being half\r\nfamished, and fearing that my craving for food was not likely to be\r\ngratified unless someone in the camp would take pity upon my forlorn\r\ncondition, I boldly presented myself at the first tent I came across.\r\nThe occupant came out, and, on hearing the strait I was in, he with\r\nkindly courtesy invited me to enter the tent, saying, 'You are just\r\nin time to share our dinner.' My host turned out to be Major Crawford\r\nChamberlain,[3] commanding the 1st Irregular Cavalry, the famous\r\nSkinner's Horse, then on its way to Peshawar. A lady was sitting at\r\nthe table--Mrs. Chamberlain--to whom I was introduced; I spent a very\r\npleasant evening, and in this way commenced another equally agreeable\r\nand lasting friendship.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A Native woman-servant.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Now Field Marshal Sir Donald Stewart, Bart., G.C.B.,\r\nG.C.S.I.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Now General Crawford Chamberlain, C.S.I., a brother of\r\nGeneral Sir Neville Chamberlain.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n1852-1853\r\n\r\n  With my father at Peshawar--Peshawar in 1852--Excitements of a\r\n  frontier station--A flogging parade--Mackeson's assassination\r\n  --The Jowaki expedition--A strange dream--A typical frontier fight\r\n\r\n\r\nEven the longest journey must come to an end at last, and early\r\nin November I reached Peshawar. My father, who was then in his\r\nsixty-ninth year, had just been appointed to command the division\r\nwith the temporary rank of Major-General. Old as this may appear at\r\na period when Colonels are superannuated at fifty-seven, and\r\nMajor-Generals must retire at sixty-two, my father did not consider\r\nhimself particularly unlucky. As for the authorities, they evidently\r\nthought they were to be congratulated on having so young and active an\r\nofficer to place in a position of responsibility upon the North-West\r\nFrontier, for amongst my father's papers I found letters from\r\nthe Adjutant-General and Quartermaster-General expressing high\r\nsatisfaction at his appointment to this difficult command.\r\n\r\nIt was a great advantage as well as a great pleasure to me to be with\r\nmy father at this time. I had left India an infant, and I had no\r\nrecollection of him until I was twelve years old, at which time he\r\ncame home on leave. Even then I saw very little of him, as I was at\r\nschool during the greater part of his sojourn in England, thus we met\r\nat Peshawar almost as strangers. We did not, however, long remain so;\r\nhis affectionate greeting soon put an end to any feeling of shyness on\r\nmy part, and the genial and kindly spirit which enabled him to enter\r\ninto and sympathize with the feelings and aspirations of men younger\r\nthan himself, rendered the year I spent with him at Peshawar one\r\nof the brightest and happiest of my early life. In one respect\r\nparticularly I benefited by the intercourse and confidence of the\r\nyear in question. My father spoke to me freely of his experiences in\r\nAfghanistan, where he commanded during the Afghan war first a brigade,\r\nand then Shah Shuja's contingent. The information I in this way\r\ngathered regarding the characteristics of that peculiar country, and\r\nthe best means of dealing with its still more peculiar people, was\r\ninvaluable to me when I, in my turn, twenty-five years later, found\r\nmyself in command of an army in Afghanistan.\r\n\r\nEleven years only had elapsed since the first Afghan war, when my\r\nfather went to Peshawar and found himself again associated with\r\nseveral Afghan friends; some had altogether settled in the Peshawar\r\ndistrict, for nearly all of those who had assisted us, or shown any\r\nfriendly feeling towards us, had been forced by Dost Mahomed Khan, on\r\nhis return as Amir to Kabul, to seek refuge in India. One of the chief\r\nof these unfortunate refugees was Mahomed Usman Khan, Shah Shuja's\r\nWazir, or Prime Minister. He had been very intimate with my father, so\r\nit was pleasant for them to meet again and talk over events in which\r\nthey had both played such prominent parts. Usman Khan died some years\r\nago; but visitors to India who travel as far as Peshawar may still\r\nmeet his sons, one of whom is the Commandant of the Khyber Rifles,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Aslam Khan, C.I.E., a fine specimen of a Native\r\nsoldier and gentleman, who has proved his loyalty and done excellent\r\nservice to the State on many trying occasions.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL SIR ABRAHAM ROBERTS, G.C.B.\r\n\r\n_From a photograph_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMy father had also been on terms of intimacy with Dost Mahomed\r\nhimself and many other men of influence in Kabul, from whom, while at\r\nPeshawar, he received most interesting letters, in which anxiety was\r\noften expressed as to whether the English were amicably disposed\r\ntowards the Amir. To these communications my father was always careful\r\nto send courteous and conciliatory replies. The correspondence which\r\ntook place confirmed him in his frequently expressed opinion that it\r\nwould be greatly to the advantage of the Government, and obviate\r\nthe necessity for keeping such large garrisons on the frontier, if\r\nfriendly relations could be established with the Amir, and with the\r\nneighbouring tribes, who more or less looked to the Ruler of Kabul\r\nas their Chief. My father accordingly addressed the Secretary to the\r\nGovernment of India, and pointed out how successfully some of the most\r\nexperienced Anglo-Indian officials had managed barbarous tribes by\r\nkindness and conciliation.\r\n\r\nMy father was prevented by ill-health from remaining long enough at\r\nPeshawar to see the result of his proposals, but it was a source of\r\ngreat satisfaction to him to learn before he left India[1] that they\r\nwere approved by Lord Dalhousie (the Governor-General), and that they\r\nwere already bearing fruit. That the Amir was himself ready to respond\r\nto any overtures made to him was evident from a letter written by a\r\nbrother of the Dost's, which was discovered amongst the papers of\r\nColonel Mackeson (the Commissioner of Peshawar) after his death. It\r\nwas still more gratifying to my father to find that the views of\r\nMackeson's successor, Lieutenant-Colonel Herbert Edwardes, on this\r\nsubject entirely coincided with his own. This distinguished officer\r\nand brilliant administrator zealously maintained this policy, and\r\nsucceeded in establishing such a good understanding with the Ruler\r\nof Kabul that, when the Mutiny broke out, Afghanistan stood aloof,\r\ninstead of, as might have been the case, turning the scale against us.\r\n\r\nThe Peshawar division in 1852 was not only the most important, but\r\nthe largest, in India. It included besides Attock, Rawal Pindi, and\r\nJhelum, the hill-station of Murree, which had only been recently\r\noccupied. The cantonment of Peshawar had been laid out by Sir Colin\r\nCampbell (afterwards Lord Clyde), who commanded there when we first\r\noccupied that place in 1849. He crowded the troops, European and\r\nNative, into as small a space as possible in order that the station\r\nmight be the more easily protected from the raids of the Afridis\r\nand other robber tribes, who had their homes in the neighbouring\r\nmountains, and constantly descended into the valley for the sake of\r\nplunder. To resist these marauders it was necessary to place guards\r\nall round the cantonment. The smaller the enclosure, the fewer guards\r\nwould be required. From this point of view alone was Sir Colin's\r\naction excusable; but the result of this overcrowding was what it\r\nalways is, especially in a tropical climate like that of India, and\r\nfor long years Peshawar was a name of terror to the English soldier\r\nfrom its proverbial unhealthiness. The water-supply for the first\r\nfive-and-twenty years of our occupation was extremely bad, and\r\nsanitary arrangements, particularly as regards Natives, were\r\napparently considered unnecessary.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the cordon of sentries round the cantonment, strong\r\npiquets were posted on all the principal roads leading towards the\r\nhills; and every house had to be guarded by a _chokidar_, or watchman,\r\nbelonging to one of the robber tribes. The maintaining this watchman\r\nwas a sort of blackmail, without consenting to which no one's horses\r\nor other property were safe. The watchmen were armed with all sorts of\r\nquaint old firearms, which, on an alarm being given, they discharged\r\nin the most reckless manner, making it quite a work of danger to pass\r\nalong a Peshawar road after dark. No one was allowed to venture beyond\r\nthe line of sentries when the sun had set, and even in broad daylight\r\nit was not safe to go any distance from the station.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1851 an officer--Captain Frank Grantham, of the 98th\r\nFoot--was riding with a young lady on the Michni road, not far from\r\nthe Artillery quarter-guard, when he was attacked by five hill-men.\r\nGrantham was wounded so severely that he died in a few days, the\r\nhorses were carried off, but the girl was allowed to escape. She ran\r\nas fast as she could to the nearest guard, and told her story; the\r\nalarm was given, and the wounded man was brought in. The young lady\r\nwas called upon shortly afterwards to identify one of the supposed\r\nmurderers, but she could not recognize the man as being of the party\r\nwho made the attack; nevertheless, the murderer's friends were afraid\r\nof what she might remember, and made an attempt one night to carry her\r\noff. Fortunately, it was frustrated, but from that time, until she\r\nleft Peshawar, it was considered necessary to keep a guard over the\r\nhouse in which she lived.\r\n\r\nFrom all this my readers may probably think that Peshawar, as I first\r\nknew it, was not a desirable place of residence; but I was very happy\r\nthere. There was a good deal of excitement and adventure; I made many\r\nfriends; and, above all, I had, to me, the novel pleasure of being\r\nwith my father.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom in those days for the General commanding one of the\r\nlarger divisions to have under him, and in charge of the Head-Quarter\r\nstation, a senior officer styled Brigadier. Soon after I went to\r\nPeshawar, Sydney Cotton[2] held this appointment, and remained in\r\nit for many years, making a great reputation for himself during the\r\nMutiny, and being eventually appointed to the command of the division.\r\nThe two senior officers on my father's staff were Lieutenant Norman[3]\r\nand Lieutenant Lumsden,[4] the former Deputy Assistant-Adjutant-General\r\nand the latter Deputy Assistant-Quartermaster-General. The high opinion\r\nof them which my father had formed was subsequently justified by their\r\ndistinguished careers. Norman, with sixteen years' service, and at the\r\nage of thirty-four, became Adjutant-General of the Army in India, and\r\na year or two later Secretary to Government in the Military Department.\r\nHe finished his Indian service as Military Member of Council. Lumsden\r\nbecame Quartermaster-General, and afterwards Adjutant-General, the two\r\nhighest positions on the Indian staff.\r\n\r\nThere was a separate mess for all the staff officers, and I remember\r\na curious circumstance in connexion with that mess which, unless the\r\nexception proves the rule, is strong evidence against the superstition\r\nthat thirteen is an unlucky number to sit down to dinner. On the 1st\r\nJanuary, 1853, thirteen of us dined together; eleven years after we\r\nwere all alive, nearly the whole of the party having taken part in the\r\nsuppression of the Mutiny, and five or six having been wounded.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of my arrival until the autumn of 1853, nothing of\r\nmuch importance occurred. I lived with my father, and acted as his\r\nAide-de-camp, while, at the same time, I did duty with the Artillery.\r\nThe 2nd Company, 2nd Battalion, to which I belonged, was composed of a\r\nfine body of men, who had a grand reputation in the field, but, being\r\nsomewhat troublesome in quarters, had acquired the nickname of 'The\r\nDevil's Own.' Because of the unusually good physique of the men, this\r\ncompany was selected for conversion into a Mountain Battery, which it\r\nwas thought advisable to raise at that time. I was the only subaltern\r\nwith this battery for several months, and though my commanding officer\r\nhad no objection to my acting as A.D.C. to my father, he took good\r\ncare that I did my regimental duty strictly and regularly.\r\n\r\nOne very painful circumstance stamped itself on my memory. I was\r\nobliged to be present at a flogging parade--the only one, I am glad to\r\nsay, I have ever had to attend, although the barbarous and degrading\r\ncustom of flogging in the army was not done away with until nearly\r\nthirty years later.[5] A few years before I joined the service, the\r\nnumber of lashes which might be given was limited to fifty, but even\r\nunder this restriction the sight was a horrible one to witness. The\r\nparade to which I refer was ordered for the punishment of two men who\r\nhad been sentenced to fifty lashes each for selling their kits, and to\r\na certain term of imprisonment in addition. They were fine, handsome\r\nyoung Horse Artillerymen, and it was hateful to see them thus treated.\r\nBesides, one felt it was productive of harm rather than good, for it\r\ntended to destroy the men's self-respect, and to make them completely\r\nreckless. In this instance, no sooner had the two men been released\r\nfrom prison than they committed the same offence again. They were a\r\nsecond time tried by Court-Martial, and sentenced as before. How I\r\nlonged to have the power to remit the fifty lashes, for I felt that\r\nselling their kits on this occasion was their way of showing their\r\nresentment at the ignominious treatment they had been subjected to,\r\nand of proving that flogging was powerless to prevent their repeating\r\nthe offence. A parade was ordered, as on the previous occasion. One\r\nman was stripped to the waist, and tied to the wheel of a gun. The\r\nfinding and sentence of the Court-Martial were read out--a trumpeter\r\nstanding ready the while to inflict the punishment--when the\r\ncommanding officer, Major Robert Waller, instead of ordering him to\r\nbegin, to the intense relief of, I believe, every officer present,\r\naddressed the prisoners, telling them of his distress at finding two\r\nsoldiers belonging to his troop brought up for corporal punishment\r\ntwice in a little more than six weeks, and adding that, however little\r\nthey deserved such leniency, if they would promise not to commit the\r\nsame offence again, and to behave better for the future, he would\r\nremit the flogging part of the sentence. If the prisoners were not\r\nhappy, I was; but the clemency was evidently appreciated by them, for\r\nthey promised, and kept their words. I did not lose sight of these\r\ntwo men for some years, and was always gratified to learn that their\r\nconduct was uniformly satisfactory, and that they had become good,\r\nsteady soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner, or chief civil authority, when I arrived at\r\nPeshawar, was Colonel Mackeson, a well-known frontier officer who had\r\ngreatly distinguished himself during the first Afghan war by his work\r\namong the Afridis and other border tribes, by whom he was liked and\r\nrespected as much as he was feared. During Shah Shuja's brief reign\r\nat Kabul, Mackeson was continually employed on political duty in the\r\nKhyber Pass and at Peshawar. On the breaking out of the insurrection\r\nat Kabul, he was indefatigable in forwarding supplies and money to\r\nSir Robert Sale at Jalalabad, hastening up the reinforcements, and\r\nmaintaining British influence in the Khyber, a task of no small\r\nmagnitude when we remember that a religious war had been proclaimed,\r\nand all true believers had been called upon to exterminate the\r\nFeringhis. While at Peshawar, as Commissioner, his duties were arduous\r\nand his responsibilities heavy--the more so as at that time the Afghan\r\ninhabitants of the city were in a dangerous and excited state.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th September, 1853, we were horrified to learn that Mackeson\r\nhad been murdered by a religious fanatic. He was sitting in the\r\nverandah of his house listening to appeals from the decisions of his\r\nsubordinates, when, towards evening, a man--who had been remarked\r\nby many during the day earnestly engaged in his devotions, his\r\nprayer-carpet being spread within sight of the house--came up and,\r\nmaking a low salaam to Mackeson, presented him with a paper. The\r\nCommissioner, supposing it to be a petition, stretched out his hand to\r\ntake it, when the man instantly plunged a dagger into his breast. The\r\nnoise consequent on the struggle attracted the attention of some of\r\nthe domestic servants and one of the Native officials. The latter\r\nthrew himself between Mackeson and the fanatic, and was himself\r\nslightly wounded in his efforts to rescue his Chief.\r\n\r\nMackeson lingered until the 14th September. His death caused\r\nconsiderable excitement in the city and along the border, increasing\r\nto an alarming extent when it became known that the murderer had been\r\nhanged and his body burnt. This mode of disposing of one of their dead\r\nis considered by Mahomedans as the greatest insult that can be offered\r\nto their religion, for in thus treating the corpse, as if it were that\r\nof (by them) a hated and despised Hindu, the dead man is supposed to\r\nbe deprived of every chance of paradise. It was not without careful\r\nand deliberate consideration that this course was decided upon, and it\r\nwas only adopted on account of the deterrent effect it would have upon\r\nfanatical Mahomedans, who count it all gain to sacrifice their lives\r\nby the murder of a heretic, and thereby secure, as they firmly\r\nbelieve, eternal happiness, but loathe the idea of being burned, which\r\neffectually prevents the murderer being raised to the dignity of a\r\nmartyr, and revered as a saint ever after.\r\n\r\nIt being rumoured that the Pathans intended to retaliate by\r\ndesecrating the late Commissioner's grave, it was arranged that he\r\nshould be buried within cantonment limits. A monument was raised to\r\nhis memory by public subscription, and his epitaph[6] was written by\r\nthe Governor-General himself.\r\n\r\nShortly before Mackeson's murder my father had found it necessary to\r\ngo to the hill-station of Murree; the hot weather had tried him very\r\nmuch, and he required a change. He had scarcely arrived there, when\r\nhe was startled by the news of the tragedy which had occurred, and at\r\nonce determined to return, notwithstanding its being the most sickly\r\nseason of the year at Peshawar, for he felt that at a time of such\r\ndangerous excitement it was his duty to be present. As a precautionary\r\nmeasure, he ordered the 22nd Foot from Rawal Pindi to Peshawar. This\r\nand other steps which he deemed prudent to take soon put an end to the\r\ndisturbances.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had matters quieted down at Peshawar than the Jowaki\r\nAfridis, who inhabit the country immediately to the east of the Kohat\r\nPass, began to give trouble, and we went out into camp to select a\r\nsite for a post which would serve to cover the northern entrance to\r\nthe pass and keep the tribesmen under surveillance. The great change\r\nof temperature, from the intense heat he had undergone in the summer\r\nto the bitter cold of November nights in tents, was too severe a trial\r\nfor my father. He was then close on seventy, and though apparently\r\nactive as ever, he was far from well, consequently the doctors\r\nstrongly urged him not to risk another hot weather in India. It was\r\naccordingly settled that he should return to England without delay.\r\n\r\nShortly before his departure, an incident occurred which I will relate\r\nfor the benefit of psychological students; they may, perhaps, be able\r\nto explain it, I never could. My father had some time before issued\r\ninvitations for a dance which was to take place in two days' time--on\r\nMonday, the 17th October, 1853. On the Saturday morning he appeared\r\ndisturbed and unhappy, and during breakfast he was silent and\r\ndespondent--very different from his usual bright and cheery self.\r\nOn my questioning him as to the cause, he told me he had had an\r\nunpleasant dream--one which he had dreamt several times before, and\r\nwhich had always been followed by the death of a near relation. As the\r\nday advanced, in spite of my efforts to cheer him, he became more and\r\nmore depressed, and even said he should like to put off the dance. I\r\ndissuaded him from taking this step for the time being; but that night\r\nhe had the same dream again, and the next morning he insisted on\r\nthe dance being postponed. It seemed to me rather absurd to have to\r\ndisappoint our friends because of a dream; there was, however, nothing\r\nfor it but to carry out my father's wishes, and intimation was\r\naccordingly sent to the invited guests. The following morning the post\r\nbrought news of the sudden death of the half-sister at Lahore with\r\nwhom I had stayed on my way to Peshawar.\r\n\r\nAs my father was really very unwell, it was not thought advisable for\r\nhim to travel alone, so it was arranged that I should accompany him to\r\nRawal Pindi. We started from Peshawar on the 27th November, and drove\r\nas far as Nowshera. The next day we went on to Attock. I found the\r\ninvalid had benefited so much by the change that it was quite safe for\r\nhim to continue the journey alone, and I consented the more readily to\r\nleave him, as I was anxious to get back to my battery, which had been\r\nordered on service, and was then with the force assembled at Bazidkhel\r\nfor an expedition against the Bori villages of the Jowaki Afridis.\r\n\r\nHaving said farewell to my father, I started for Bazidkhel early on\r\nthe 29th November. At that time there was no direct road to that place\r\nfrom Nowshera, nor was it considered safe to travel alone along the\r\nslopes of the lower Afridi hills. I had, therefore, to go all the way\r\nback to Peshawar to get to my destination. I rode as fast as relays of\r\nhorses could carry me, in the hope that I should reach Bazidkhel in\r\ntime for the fun; but soon after passing Nowshera I heard guns in the\r\ndirection of the Kohat Pass, and realized that I should be too late.\r\nI was very disappointed at missing this, my first chance of active\r\nservice, and not accompanying the newly raised Mountain Train (as it\r\nwas then called) on the first occasion of its being employed in the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nThe object of this expedition was to punish the Jowaki section of the\r\nAfridis for their many delinquencies during the three previous years.\r\nNumerous murders and raids on the Kohat and Peshawar districts,\r\nthe plunder of boats on the Indus, and the murder of a European\r\napothecary, were all traced to this tribe. They had been blockaded,\r\nand their resort to the salt-mines near Bahadurkhel and to the markets\r\nof Kohat and Peshawar had been interdicted, but these measures\r\nproduced no effect on the recalcitrant tribesmen. John (afterwards\r\nLord) Lawrence, who had come to Peshawar for the purpose of taking (sic)\r\nover frontier affairs with Edwardes, the new Commissioner, held a\r\nconference with the _maliks_[7] of the villages connected with the\r\nJowaki Pass, and being anxious to avoid hostilities, offered to\r\ncondone all past offences if the tribes would agree to certain\r\nconditions, which, briefly, were that no further crimes should be\r\ncommitted in British territory; that such criminals as had taken\r\nrefuge in their villages should be given up; and that for the future\r\ncriminals and outlaws flying from justice should not be afforded\r\nan asylum in Jowaki lands. To the second condition the whole tribe\r\nabsolutely refused to agree. They stated, with truth, that from time\r\nimmemorial it was their custom to afford an asylum to anyone demanding\r\nit, and that to surrender a man who had sought and found shelter with\r\nthem would be a disgrace which they could not endure.\r\n\r\nAfridis have curious ideas as to the laws of hospitality; it is no\r\nuncommon thing for them to murder their guests in cold blood, but it\r\nis contrary to their code of honour to surrender a fugitive who has\r\nclaimed an asylum with them.\r\n\r\nThe sections of the tribe living nearest our territory agreed to the\r\nfirst and third of our conditions, no doubt because they felt they\r\nwere in our power, and had suffered considerably from the blockade.\r\nBut the Bori Afridis would make no atonement for the past and give\r\nno security for the future, although they admitted having robbed and\r\nmurdered our subjects. There was nothing for it, therefore, but to\r\nsend a force against them. This force consisted of rather more than\r\n1,500 men, British and Native. The Afridis made no stand until we\r\nreached their main position, when they offered a stout resistance,\r\nwhich, however, proved of no avail against the gallantry of the Guides\r\nand 66th (now 1st) Gurkhas. The Bori villages were then destroyed,\r\nwith a loss to us of eight men killed and thirty-one wounded.\r\n\r\nSufficient punishment having been inflicted, our force retired. The\r\nrear-guard was hotly pressed, and it was late in the evening before\r\nthe troops got clear of the hills.\r\n\r\nThe tribesmen with whom we had just made friends sat in hundreds on\r\nthe ridges watching the progress of the fight. It was no doubt a great\r\ntemptation to them to attack the 'infidels' while they were at their\r\nmercy, and considerable anxiety was felt by Lawrence and Edwardes\r\nas to the part which our new allies would play; their relief was\r\nproportionate when it was found they intended to maintain a neutral\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\nI shall not further describe the events of that day, more especially\r\nas I was not fortunate enough to be in time to take part in the\r\nproceedings. I have only referred to this expedition as being typical\r\nof many little frontier fights, and because I remember being much\r\nimpressed at the time with the danger of trusting our communications\r\nin a difficult mountainous country to people closely allied to those\r\nagainst whom we were fighting. This over-confidence in the good faith\r\nof our frontier neighbours caused us serious embarrassments a few\r\nyears later during the Umbeyla campaign.\r\n\r\nThe force remained in camp for some time for the protection of the men\r\nemployed in building the post, which was called Fort Mackeson, after\r\nthe murdered Commissioner. When it was completed we returned to\r\nPeshawar.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Shortly before my father left Peshawar he received\r\nthe following letter from Colonel Outram, dated Calcutta, the 23rd\r\nOctober, 1853: 'As I know that your views as to the policy that should\r\nbe pursued towards Dost Mahomed must be in accordance with those of\r\nthe Governor-General, I accordingly showed your letter to Grant,\r\nCourtney, and Colonel Low, all of whom were glad to learn that you\r\nentertained such sound views, opposed though they be with the general\r\nclamour for war with the Kabulese which appears to be the cry of the\r\narmy. This, together with the wise forethought you displayed before\r\nthe Kabul insurrection (which, though at the time it found no favour\r\nat Head-Quarters, was subsequently so mournfully established by the\r\nKabul massacre, which would have been prevented had your warnings\r\nbeen attended to), shows how well you would combine the military and\r\npolitical control of the country beyond the Indus.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The late General Sir Sydney Cotton, G.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Now General Sir Henry Norman, G.C.B., G.C.M.G., lately\r\nGovernor of Queensland.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Now General Sir Peter Lumsden, G.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: 1881.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6:\r\n\r\n            'HERE LIES THE BODY OF FREDERICK MACKESON,\r\n\r\n  LIEUTENANT-COLONEL IN THE BENGAL ARMY, COMPANION OF THE BATH, AND\r\n\r\n COMMISSIONER OF PESHAWAR, WHO WAS BORN SEPTEMBER 2ND, 1807, AND DIED\r\n\r\n  SEPTEMBER 14TH, 1853, OF A WOUND INFLICTED BY A RELIGIOUS FANATIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was the beau-ideal of a soldier--cool to conceive, brave to dare,\r\nand strong to do.

I travelled _viâ_ Murree to Abbottabad, along the route now\r\nwell known as the 'Gullies.' Here I was joined by Lieutenant George\r\nRodney Brown,[1] a subaltern of Horse Artillery, with whom I chummed\r\nat Peshawar.\r\n\r\nAbbottabad was a very small place in those days. It was named after\r\nits first Deputy-Commissioner, James Abbott,[2] famous for his journey\r\n_viâ_ Bokhara and Khiva to Russia in 1839, undertaken for the release\r\nof Russian prisoners who were kept as slaves by the Turkomans. He had\r\njust left, and had been succeeded as Deputy-Commissioner by a Captain\r\nBecher, who, fortunately for us, was away in the district. I say\r\nfortunately, because we were bent on visiting Khagan, and had obtained\r\npermission from the Commissioner of Peshawar to do so. He had told\r\nus to apply to Becher for assistance, but from what we heard of that\r\nofficer, it did not seem likely he would help us. Khagan was beyond\r\nour border, and the inhabitants were said to be even more fanatical\r\nthan the rest of the frontier tribes. The Commissioner, however, had\r\ngiven us leave, and as his Deputy appeared to be the kind of man\r\nto create obstacles, we made up our minds to slip away before he\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nWe started on the 21st May, and marched to Habibula-Ki-Ghari. Here the\r\nroad bifurcates, one branch leading to Kashmir, the other to Khagan.\r\nWe took the latter, and proceeded to Balakot, twelve miles further\r\non, which was then our frontier post. There we found a small guard of\r\nFrontier Police, two of whom we induced to accompany us on our onward\r\njourney for the purpose of assisting to look after the baggage and\r\ncollecting coolies. Three days' more marching brought us to Khagan.\r\nThe road almost the whole way from Balakot ran along a precipice\r\noverhanging the Nainsukh river, at that time of year a rushing\r\ntorrent, owing to the melting of the snows on the higher ranges. The\r\ntrack was rough, steep, and in some places very narrow. We crossed and\r\nrecrossed the river several times by means of snow-bridges, which,\r\nspanning the limpid, jade-coloured water, had a very pretty effect. At\r\none point our _shikarris_[3] stopped, and proudly told us that on that\r\nvery spot their tribe had destroyed a Sikh army sent against them in\r\nthe time of Runjit Sing. It certainly was a place well chosen for a\r\nstand, not more than fifty yards wide, with a perpendicular cliff on\r\none side and a roaring torrent on the other.\r\n\r\nThe people apparently did not object to our being in their country,\r\nand treated us with much civility throughout our journey. We were\r\nenjoying ourselves immensely, so when an official cover reached us\r\nwith the signature of the dreaded Deputy-Commissioner in the corner,\r\nwe agreed that it would be unwise to open it just then.\r\n\r\nKhagan was almost buried in snow. The scenery was magnificent, and\r\nbecame every moment more wonderful as we slowly climbed the steep\r\nascent in front of us; range after range of snow-capped mountains\r\ndisclosed themselves to our view, rising higher and higher into the\r\nair, until at last, towering above all, Nanga Parbat[4] in all her\r\nspotless beauty was revealed to our astonished and delighted gaze.\r\n\r\nWe could not get beyond Khagan. Our coolies refused to go further,\r\nalleging as their reason the danger to be dreaded from avalanches\r\nin that month; but I suspect that fear of hostility from the tribes\r\nfurther north had more to do with their reluctance to proceed than\r\ndread of falling avalanches. We remained at Khagan for two or\r\nthree days in the hope of being able to shoot an ibex, but we were\r\ndisappointed; we never even saw one.\r\n\r\nWe retraced our steps with considerable regret, and reached\r\nHabibula-Ki-Ghari on the 31st May. Here we received a second official\r\ndocument from Abbottabad. It contained, like the previous letter,\r\nwhich we now looked at for the first time, orders for our immediate\r\nreturn, and warnings that we were on no account to go to Khagan. Since\r\nthen Khagan has been more than once visited by British officers, and\r\nnow a road is in course of construction along the route we travelled,\r\nas being a more direct line of communication with Gilghit than that\r\n_viâ_ Kashmir.\r\n\r\nWe made no delay at Habibula-Ki-Ghari, but started at once for the\r\nlovely Vale of Kashmir, where we spent the summer, amusing ourselves\r\nby making excursions to all the places of interest and beauty we had\r\nso often heard of, and occasionally shooting a bear. The place which\r\nimpressed me most was Martund,[5] where stand the picturesque ruins of\r\na once renowned Hindu temple. These noble ruins are the most striking\r\nin size and position of all the existing remains of the past glories\r\nof Kashmir.\r\n\r\nFrom Martund we made our way to Vernag, the celebrated spring which\r\nis supposed to be the source of the Jhelum river. The Moghul Emperor\r\nAkbar built there a summer palace, and the arches, on which it is\r\nsaid rested the private apartments of the lovely Nur Jehan, are still\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nWe wandered over the beautiful and fertile Lolab valley, and pitched\r\nour little camp in the midst of groves of chunar, walnut, apple,\r\ncherry, and peach trees; and we marched up the Sind valley, and\r\ncrossed the Zojji La Pass leading into Thibet. The scenery all along\r\nthis route is extremely grand. On either side are lofty mountains,\r\ntheir peaks wrapped in snow, their sides clothed with pine, and their\r\nfeet covered with forests, in which is to be found almost every kind\r\nof deciduous tree. From time to time we returned for a few days to\r\nSrinagar, the capital of Kashmir, to enjoy the pleasures of more\r\ncivilized society. Srinagar is so well known nowadays, and has been\r\nso often described in poetry and prose, that it is needless for me to\r\ndwell at length upon its delights, which, I am inclined to think, are\r\ngreater in imagination than in reality. It has been called the Venice\r\nof the East, and in some respects it certainly does remind one of the\r\n'Bride of the Sea,' both in its picturesqueness and (when one gets\r\ninto the small and tortuous canals) its unsavouriness. Even at the\r\ntime of which I am writing it was dilapidated, and the houses looked\r\nexactly like those made by children out of a pack of cards, which a\r\npuff of wind might be expected to destroy. Of late years the greater\r\npart of the city has been injured by earthquakes, and Srinagar looks\r\nmore than ever like a card city. The great beauty of the place in\r\nthose days was the wooden bridges covered with creepers, and gay with\r\nbooths and shops of all descriptions, which spanned the Jhelum at\r\nintervals for the three miles the river runs through the town--now,\r\nalas! for the artistic traveller, no more. Booths and shops have been\r\nswept away, and the creepers have disappeared--decidedly an advantage\r\nfrom a sanitary point of view, but destructive of the quaint\r\npicturesqueness of the town.\r\n\r\nThe floating gardens are a unique and very pretty characteristic of\r\nSrinagar. The lake is nowhere deeper than ten or twelve feet, and in\r\nsome places much less. These gardens are made by driving stakes into\r\nthe bed of the lake, long enough to project three or four feet above\r\nthe surface of the water. These stakes are placed at intervals in an\r\noblong form, and are bound together by reeds and rushes twined in and\r\nout and across, until a kind of stationary raft is made, on which\r\nearth and turf are piled. In this soil seeds are sown, and the crops\r\nof melons and other fruits raised in these fertile beds are extremely\r\nfine and abundant.\r\n\r\nThe magnificent chunar-trees are another very beautiful feature of the\r\ncountry. They grow to a great height and girth, and so luxuriant and\r\ndense is their foliage that I have sat reading and writing for hours\r\nduring heavy rain under one of these trees and kept perfectly dry.\r\n\r\nThe immediate vicinity of Srinagar is very pretty, and the whole\r\nvalley of Kashmir is lovely beyond description: surrounded by\r\nbeautifully-wooded mountains, intersected with streams and lakes, and\r\ngay with flowers of every description, for in Kashmir many of the\r\ngorgeous eastern plants and the more simple but sweeter ones of\r\nEngland meet on common ground. To it may appropriately be applied the\r\nPersian couplet:\r\n\r\n  'Agar fardos baru-i zamin ast, hamin ast, hamin ast'\r\n  (If there be an Elysium on earth, it is this, it is this).\r\n\r\nThe soil is extremely productive; anything will grow in it. Put a\r\nstick into the ground, and in an extraordinary short space of time it\r\nbecomes a tree and bears fruit. What were we about, to sell such a\r\ncountry for three quarters of a million sterling? It would have made\r\nthe most perfect sanatorium for our troops, and furnished an admirable\r\nfield for British enterprise and colonization, its climate being as\r\nnear perfection as anything can be.\r\n\r\nHow sad it is that, in a country 'where every prospect pleases,\r\nonly man' should be 'vile'! And man, as he existed in Kashmir, was\r\nvile--vile, because so miserable. The Mahomedan inhabitants were being\r\nground down by Hindu rulers, who seized all their earnings, leaving\r\nthem barely sufficient to keep body and soul together. What interest\r\ncould such people have in cultivating their land, or doing any work\r\nbeyond what was necessary to mere existence? However hard they might\r\nlabour, their efforts would benefit neither themselves nor their\r\nchildren, and so their only thought was to get through life with\r\nas little exertion as possible--in the summer sitting in the sun\r\nabsolutely idle the greater part of the day, and in the winter wrapped\r\nup in their blankets, under which were concealed curious little\r\nvessels called _kangris_, holding two or three bits of live charcoal.\r\nEvery Kashmiri still carries one of these _kangris_, as the most\r\neconomical way of keeping himself warm.\r\n\r\nEarly in September we said good-bye to the happy valley and returned\r\nto Peshawar, where I rejoined the Mountain Battery.\r\n\r\nIn November, to my great delight, I was given my jacket. At first my\r\nhappiness was somewhat damped by the fact that the troop to which I\r\nwas posted was stationed at Umballa. I did not want to leave Peshawar,\r\nand in the end I had not to do so, as a vacancy most opportunely\r\noccurred in one of the troops of Horse Artillery at that station,\r\nwhich was given to me.\r\n\r\nLife on the frontier in those days had a great charm for most young\r\nmen; there was always something of interest going on; military\r\nexpeditions were constantly taking place, or being speculated upon,\r\nand one lived in hope of being amongst those chosen for active\r\nservice. Peshawar, too, notwithstanding its unhealthiness, was a\r\nfavourite station with officers. To me it was particularly pleasant,\r\nfor it had the largest force of Artillery of any station in India\r\nexcept Meerut; the mess was a good one, and was composed of as nice\r\na set of fellows as were to be found in the army. In addition to the\r\nofficers of the regiment, there were a certain number of honorary\r\nmembers; all the staff and civilians belonged to the Artillery mess,\r\nand on guest-nights we sat down as many as sixty to dinner. Another\r\nattraction was the 'coffee shop,' an institution which has now almost\r\nceased to exist, at which we all congregated after morning parade and\r\nfreely discussed the home and local news.\r\n\r\nThe troop to which I was posted was composed of a magnificent body of\r\nmen, nearly all Irishmen, most of whom could have lifted me up\r\nwith one hand. They were fine riders, and needed to be so, for the\r\nstud-horses used for Artillery purposes at that time were not the\r\nquiet, well-broken animals of the present day. I used to try my\r\nhand at riding them all in turn, and thus learnt to understand and\r\nappreciate the amount of nerve, patience, and skill necessary to\r\nthe making of a good Horse Artillery 'driver,' with the additional\r\nadvantage that I was brought into constant contact with the men. It\r\nalso qualified me to ride in the officers' team for the regimental\r\nbrake. The brake, it must be understood, was drawn by six horses, each\r\nridden postilion fashion by an officer.\r\n\r\nMy troop was commanded by Captain Barr, a dear old fellow who had seen\r\na good deal of service and was much liked by officers and men, but\r\nhardly the figure for a Horse Artilleryman, as he weighed about\r\nseventeen stone. On a troop parade Barr took up his position well\r\nin advance and made his own pace, but on brigade parades he had to\r\nconform to the movements of the other arms, and on these occasions he\r\nused to tell one of the subalterns as he galloped past him to come\r\n'left about' at the right time without waiting for his order. This, of\r\ncourse, we were always careful to do, and by the time we had come into\r\naction Barr had caught us up and was at his post.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1854-55 I had several returns of Peshawar fever,\r\nand by the beginning of the spring I was so reduced that I was given\r\neight months' leave on medical certificate, with orders to report\r\nmyself at Mian Mir at its expiration, in view to my going through the\r\nriding course, there being no Riding-Master at Peshawar.\r\n\r\nI decided to return to Kashmir in the first instance, and thence to\r\nmarch across the Himalayas to Simla.\r\n\r\nOn my way into Kashmir I was fortunate enough to fall in with a very\r\nagreeable travelling companion--Lieutenant John Watson.[6] He was then\r\nAdjutant of the 1st Punjab Cavalry, and was looked upon as one of\r\nthe most promising officers of the Frontier Force. We spent a very\r\nenjoyable time in Kashmir, and early in August I started for Simla\r\nwith two brother officers named Light and Mercer, whose acquaintance\r\nI had only recently made, but who turned out to be very pleasant\r\nfellow-travellers.\r\n\r\nWe marched _viâ_ Kishtwar, Chamba, and Dharmsala, a distance of about\r\n400 miles, through most beautiful scenery. At the last-named place I\r\nparted from my companions, who travelled onwards to Simla by the Kulu\r\nvalley, while I took the shorter route _viâ_ Bilaspur.\r\n\r\nThe Simla of those days was not the busy and important place it\r\nhas since become. The Governor-General seldom visited it, and the\r\nCommander-in-Chief only spent a summer there occasionally. When I\r\narrived, Sir William Gomm, the Commander-in-Chief of that day, who had\r\nbeen spending the hot weather months there, was about to give up his\r\ncommand, and Colonel Grant,[7] who had been his Adjutant-General, had\r\nleft not long before.\r\n\r\nThe only thing of interest to myself which occurred during the month I\r\nremained at Simla was that I lunched with Colonel Arthur Becher, the\r\nQuartermaster-General. I think I hear my reader say, 'Not a very\r\nremarkable event to chronicle.' But that lunch was a memorable one to\r\nme; indeed, it was the turning-point in my career, for my host was\r\ngood enough to say he should like to have me in his department some\r\nday, and this meant a great deal to me. Joining a department at that\r\ntime generally resulted in remaining in it for the greater part\r\nof one's service. There was then no limit to the tenure of staff\r\nappointments, and the object of every ambitious young officer was to\r\nget into one department or another--political, civil, or the army\r\nstaff. My father had always impressed upon me that the political\r\ndepartment was _the_ one to aspire to, and failing that, the\r\nQuartermaster-General's, as in the latter there was the best chance of\r\nseeing service. I had cherished a sort of vague hope that I might some\r\nday be lucky enough to become a Deputy Assistant-Quartermaster-General,\r\nfor although I fully recognized the advantages of a political career,\r\nI preferred being more closely associated with the army, and I had seen\r\nenough of staff work to satisfy myself that it would suit me; so the\r\nfew words spoken to me by Colonel Becher made me supremely happy.\r\n\r\nIt never entered into my head that I should get an early appointment;\r\nthe fact of the Quartermaster-General thinking of me as a possible\r\nrecruit was quite enough for me. I was in no hurry to leave the Horse\r\nArtillery, to which I was proud of belonging, and in which I hoped to\r\nsee service while still on the frontier. I left Simla very pleased\r\nwith the result of my visit, and very grateful to Colonel Becher, who\r\nproved a good friend to me ever after, and I made my way to Mian Mir,\r\nwhere I went through the riding-school course, and then returned to\r\nPeshawar.\r\n\r\n(1856) The winter of 1855-56 passed much as the cold weather generally\r\ndoes in the north of India. Our amusements consisted of an occasional\r\nrace-meeting or cricket match. Polo was unknown in those days, and\r\nhunting the jackal, a sport which has been a source of so much\r\nrecreation to the Peshawar garrison for thirty odd years, had not then\r\nbeen thought of. It was a pleasant change to visit the outposts, and\r\nwhenever I got the chance I rode over to Mardan, where the Corps\r\nof Guides were stationed, commanded by that gallant soldier, Harry\r\nLumsden,[8] who had raised the corps in 1846 under the auspices of\r\nHenry Lawrence. Many were the good gallops I enjoyed with his hawks,\r\nhunting the _aubara_.[9] Of work there was plenty at Peshawar, for the\r\nBrigadier, Sydney Cotton,[10] kept us alive with field days, carefully\r\ninstilling into us his idea that parade-grounds were simply useful for\r\ndrill and preliminary instruction, and that as soon as the rudiments\r\nof a soldier's education had been learnt, the troops should leave\r\ntheir nursery, and try as far as possible to practise in peace what\r\nthey would have to do in war. Sydney Cotton was never tired of\r\nexplaining that the machinery of war, like all other machinery, should\r\nbe kept, so to speak, oiled and ready for use.\r\n\r\nMy dream of a staff appointment was realized more quickly than I had\r\nexpected. In the early part of 1856 the Surveyor-General applied for\r\nthe services of two or three experienced officers to assist in the\r\nsurvey of Kashmir. Lumsden, the D.A.Q.M.G., was one of those selected\r\nfor the duty, and I was appointed to officiate for him. So delighted\r\nwas I to get my foot on the lowest rung of the staff ladder, that I\r\ncheerfully agreed to the condition my Captain insisted upon, that I\r\nshould perform my regimental duties in addition to the staff work.\r\nThings went merrily with me for a short time, when most unexpectedly\r\nmy hopes of some day becoming Quartermaster-General of the Army in\r\nIndia were dashed to the ground by the Governor-General refusing\r\nto confirm my appointment, because I had not passed the prescribed\r\nexamination in Hindustani. A rule existed requiring a language test,\r\nbut it had seldom been enforced, certainly not in the case of 'acting\r\nappointments,' so that this refusal came as a great blow to me. It\r\nhad, however, excellent results, for it made me determined to pass in\r\nHindustani. It was then May, and in July the half-yearly examination\r\nwas to be held. I forthwith engaged the best _munshi_[11] at Peshawar,\r\nshut myself up, and studied Indian literature from morning till night,\r\nuntil I felt pretty confident of success.\r\n\r\nJust before the examination took place, the officer who had stepped\r\ninto my shoes when I was turned out (Lieutenant Mordaunt Fitz-Gerald,\r\nof my own regiment) was offered an appointment in the Punjab Frontier\r\nForce. He consulted me as to the advisability of accepting it, and\r\nI told him I thought he ought not to do so. I considered this most\r\ndisinterested advice, for I had good reason to believe that I should\r\nbe re-appointed to the staff, should the appointment again become\r\nvacant. Fortunately for me, Fitz-Gerald followed the usual procedure\r\nof those who delight in consulting their friends. He listened to my\r\nadvice, and then decided not to follow it. Accordingly, he joined the\r\nPunjab Frontier Force, whilst I, having passed the examination, went\r\nback to the coveted appointment, and continued in the department, with\r\nthe exception of one or two short intervals, until 1878, when I left\r\nit as Quartermaster-General.\r\n\r\nThe autumn of 1856 was a very sickly one at Peshawar; fever was rife\r\namongst the troops, and in the hope of shaking it off Brigadier Cotton\r\ngot permission to take a certain number into camp. It was September,\r\nand the sun was still very hot, so that it was necessary to begin the\r\ndaily march long before dawn in order to reach the new camping ground\r\nwhile it was still tolerably cool. We crossed the Kabul river at\r\nNowshera, which place was then being made into a station for troops,\r\nand marched about the Yusafzai plain for three weeks. The chief\r\ndifficulty was the absence of water, and I had to prospect the country\r\nevery afternoon for a sufficient supply, and to determine, with regard\r\nto this _sine quâ non_, where the camp should be pitched the next day.\r\nOn one occasion the best place I could discover was between two and\r\nthree miles off the main road. There was no difficulty in reaching it\r\nby day, but I was afraid of some mistake being made when we had to\r\nleave it in the small hours of the morning, few things being more\r\nbewildering than to find one's way in the dark from a camp pitched in\r\nthe open country when once the tents have been struck. It was my duty\r\nto lead the column and see that it marched off in the right direction;\r\nknowing how anxious the Brigadier was that the new ground should be\r\nreached while it was cool, and the men be thus saved from exposure to\r\nthe sun, I was careful to note my position with regard to the stars,\r\nand to explain to the officer who was in orders to command the advance\r\nguard the direction he must take. When the time came to start, and the\r\nBrigadier was about to order the bugler to sound the march, I saw that\r\nthe advance guard was drawn up at right angles to the way in which we\r\nhad to proceed. The officer commanding it was positive he was right,\r\nand in this he was supported by Brigadier Cotton and some of the other\r\nofficers; I was equally positive that he was wrong, and that if we\r\nmarched as he proposed, we should find ourselves several miles out\r\nof our course. The Brigadier settled the question by saying I was\r\nresponsible for the troops going in the right direction, and ordering\r\nme to show the way. The country was perfectly bare, there was not\r\na tree or object of any kind to guide me, and the distance seemed\r\ninterminable. I heard opinions freely expressed that I was on the\r\nwrong road, and at last, when the Brigadier himself came up to me and\r\nsaid he thought I must have lost the way, I really began to waver in\r\nmy conviction that I was right. At that moment my horse stumbled into\r\na ditch, which proved to be the boundary of the main road. I was\r\nimmensely relieved, the Brigadier was delighted, and from that moment\r\nI think he was satisfied that I had, what is so essential to a\r\nQuartermaster-General in the field, the bump of locality.\r\n\r\nIn October the Artillery moved into the practice camp at Chamkanie,\r\nabout five miles from Peshawar. It was intended that we should remain\r\nthere for a couple of months, but before the end of that time I had\r\nto join the General at Rawal Pindi, where he had gone on a tour of\r\ninspection. Being anxious not to shirk my regimental duty, I did not\r\nleave Chamkanie until the last moment, and had but one day in which\r\nto reach Rawal Pindi, a distance of one hundred miles, which I\r\naccomplished on horseback between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m., only stopping at\r\nAttock a short time for refreshment.\r\n\r\nThis tour with General Reed ended my staff duties for a time, as\r\nthe survey in Kashmir had come to an end and Lumsden rejoined his\r\nappointment before Christmas.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Now a retired Major-General.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Now General Sir James Abbott, K.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Men who carry the guns, and point out the most likely\r\nplaces for game, etc.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: 26,000 feet above the sea-level.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Three miles east of Islamabad.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Now General Sir John Watson, V.C., K.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The late Field-Marshal Sir Patrick Grant, G.C.B.,\r\nG.C.S.I.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: The late General Sir Harry Lumsden, K.C.S.I., C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Bastard florican.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: This officer arrived in India as a Cornet in the 24th\r\nLight Dragoons in the year 1810, and although, when he reached\r\nPeshawar with his regiment--the 22nd Foot--in 1853, he had been\r\nforty-three years in the army, and was sixty-one years of age, he had\r\nnot even succeeded to the command of a battalion. He was an officer\r\nof unusual energy and activity, a fine rider, a pattern drill, and a\r\nthorough soldier all round. He was not fortunate enough to see much\r\nactive service, but it must have been a source of consolation to him\r\nto feel, when ending his days as Governor of the Royal Hospital at\r\nChelsea, that it was in a great measure owing to his foresight and\r\ndecision that there was no serious disturbance at Peshawar during the\r\neventful summer of 1857.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Instructor in Oriental languages.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n1856-1857\r\n\r\n  Lord Dalhousie's Afghan policy--Treaty with Dost Mahomed\r\n  --War with Persia--The advantage of the Amir's friendship\r\n  --John Nicholson--'A pillar of strength on the frontier'\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the year 1856, a rumour reached us that the Amir,\r\nDost Mahomed Khan, was shortly expected to arrive at Peshawar to meet\r\nthe Chief Commissioner, Sir John Lawrence, who had recently been made\r\na K.C.B.\r\n\r\nBefore describing the Amir's visit and its results, it seems desirable\r\nthat I should briefly explain how and why the visit was brought about,\r\nand then endeavour to show what an important bearing its results had\r\non the great crisis which occurred so unexpectedly a few months later.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the murdered Mackeson was succeeded\r\nas Commissioner of Peshawar by Herbert Edwardes, one of the most\r\nremarkable men that the Indian army has ever produced, and who, as I\r\nhave already mentioned, entirely concurred in my father's expressed\r\nopinion as to the great advantage it would be for the Government of\r\nIndia to enter into more friendly relations with the Ruler of Kabul.\r\nThey both held that the constant troubles all along our frontier were\r\nin a great measure due to the Amir's hostility, and that such troubles\r\nwould increase rather than diminish unless we could succeed in\r\nestablishing an _entente cordiale_ with Dost Mahomed.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 Edwardes had a correspondence with the Governor-General on the\r\nsubject, and on one occasion expressed himself as follows: 'My own\r\nfeeling is, that we have much injured Dost Mahomed, and may very well\r\nafford to let by-gones be by-gones. It would contribute much to\r\nthe security of this frontier if open relations of goodwill were\r\nestablished at Kabul. There is a sullenness in our present relations,\r\nas if both parties were brooding over the past, and expecting an\r\nopportunity in the future. This keeps up excitement and unrest, and\r\nprevents our influence and institutions taking root. I should be very\r\nglad to see a new account opened on the basis of an open treaty of\r\nfriendship and alliance.'\r\n\r\nLord Dalhousie was quite in accord with Edwardes. He thought it very\r\ndesirable to be on better terms with Kabul, but believed this to be\r\na result difficult to attain. 'I give you,' he said in a letter to\r\nEdwardes, _carte blanche_, and if you can only bring about such a\r\nresult as you propose, it will be a new feather in your cap.'\r\n\r\nLord Dalhousie was supported by the British Government in his opinion\r\nas to the desirability of coming to a better understanding with the\r\nAmir. War with Russia was then imminent, and the strained condition of\r\nEuropean politics made it expedient that we should be on more amicable\r\nterms with Afghanistan.\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General thus wrote to Edwardes:\r\n\r\n'Prospects of a war between Russia and Turkey are watched with\r\ninterest by all.... In England they are fidgety regarding this border\r\nbeyond all reason, and most anxious for that declared amity and that\r\nformal renewal of friendly relations which you advocate in your\r\nletter.'\r\n\r\nThe balance of Indian opinion, however, was against our making\r\novertures to Dost Mahomed. John Lawrence, at that time the great power\r\nin the Punjab, was altogether opposed to Edwardes's policy in this\r\nmatter. He admitted that it might be wise to renew intercourse\r\nwith the Kabul ruler if he first expressed his regret for previous\r\nmisunderstandings; but later he wrote to Edwardes:\r\n\r\n    'I dare say you are right; still, I cannot divest myself of the\r\n    idea that it is _a mistake_, and will end in mixing us up in\r\n    Afghan politics and affairs more than is desirable. The strength\r\n    which a treaty can give us seems to be a delusion. It will be like\r\n    the reed on which, if a man lean, it will break and pierce his\r\n    hand.'\r\n\r\nJohn Nicholson, Outram, and James Abbott agreed with Lawrence.\r\nThey urged that any advance on our part would be looked upon as an\r\nindication of conscious weakness; and the probability was that an\r\narrogant, irritated Mussulman ruler would regard an overture as a\r\nproof of our necessity, and would make our necessity his opportunity.\r\nBut Lord Dalhousie, while anxious to avoid any communication being\r\nmade which could be liable to misconstruction, saw neither objection\r\nnor risk in opening the door to reconciliation, provided no undue\r\nanxiety was displayed on our part. The Governor-General practically\r\nleft the matter in the hands of Edwardes, who lost no time in trying\r\nto attain the desired object. The greatest forbearance and diplomatic\r\nskill were necessary to bring the negotiations to a satisfactory\r\ntermination, but they were concluded at last, most successfully, and\r\nto Edwardes alone is due the credit. It is instructive to read the\r\nfull record[1] of this tedious and difficult piece of diplomacy,\r\nfor it serves as an interesting example of Oriental subtlety and\r\ncircumlocution, contrasted with the straightforward dealing of a\r\nhigh-minded Englishman.\r\n\r\nThe Amir wrote a letter to the Governor-General couched in most\r\nsatisfactory terms, which he forwarded to Peshawar by the hand of his\r\nconfidential secretary, and which received, as it deserved, a very\r\nfriendly reply. This resulted in Dost Mahomed sending his son and\r\nheir-apparent, Sardar Ghulam Haidar Khan, to Peshawar, and deputing\r\nhim to act as his Plenipotentiary in the negotiations. Ghulam Haidar\r\nKhan reached Peshawar in March, 1855, where he was met by the Chief\r\nCommissioner, and on the 30th of that month the treaty was concluded.\r\n'It guaranteed that we should respect the Amir's possessions in\r\nAfghanistan, and never interfere with them; while the Amir engaged\r\nsimilarly to respect British territory, and to be the friend of our\r\nfriends and the enemy of our enemies.'\r\n\r\nThe Governor-General had at first resolved to entrust to Edwardes the\r\nduty of meeting the expected Envoy from Kabul, and orders to that\r\neffect were issued. But Edwardes, more anxious for the success of\r\nthe negotiations than for his own honour and glory, wrote to\r\nLord Dalhousie suggesting that the Government of India should be\r\nrepresented by the Chief Commissioner of the Punjab, and promising to\r\nafford Sir John Lawrence all the assistance in his power. Edwardes\r\nbelieved that the importance of the treaty would be enhanced in the\r\neyes of the Afghans by the presence of the higher official; and in\r\nthis opinion the Governor-General concurred. On the conclusion of the\r\ntreaty, Lord Dalhousie wrote to Edwardes: 'I congratulate you and\r\nmyself and all else concerned on this successful issue of the\r\nnegotiations, which have now lasted just a year.'\r\n\r\nThis treaty of March, 1855, was only preliminary to that for the\r\nratification of which the Amir came in person to Peshawar the\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1855 Dost Mahomed found himaelf in considerable\r\ndifficulties, and appealed to us for assistance. A revolt had occurred\r\nat Herat, and a Persian army was preparing to besiege that fortress;\r\nthe chiefs and people of Kandahar were disaffected; and the province\r\nof Balkh was threatened with invasion both by the King of Bokhara and\r\nby Turkoman hordes. The Amir looked upon Herat as an integral part of\r\nthe Afghan dominions, and was very desirous of re-establishing his\r\nauthority over that place and preventing its falling into the hands of\r\nthe Persians; but he felt himself too weak to have any hope of success\r\nwithout help from us in men and money. It was, therefore, Dost\r\nMahomed's interest to convince the British Government that the Shah\r\nhad infringed the conditions of an engagement entered into with us in\r\n1853, under which Persia abandoned all claim to Herat. The Amir thus\r\nhoped to establish a quarrel between England and Persia for his own\r\nbenefit, and to secure our assistance against the latter power. To\r\nfurther this design, Dost Mahomed offered to come to Peshawar and\r\nconsult with the British authorities. Edwardes was in favour of the\r\nproposed visit. John Lawrence was opposed to it, saying he did not\r\nthink much good would result from such a meeting, because it could\r\nhardly be anticipated that the views of the Amir and the British\r\nGovernment would coincide, and if Dost Mahomed should fail to obtain\r\nwhat he wanted, his dissatisfaction would be a positive evil. The\r\nGovernor-General admitted the force of these objections, but in the\r\nend considered that they should be set aside if the Amir was in\r\nearnest in desiring a consultation. 'A refusal or an evasion to comply\r\nwith his wish,' Lord Dalhousie thought, 'might be misunderstood, and\r\nalthough a meeting might lead to disappointment and disagreement, it\r\nwould, at any rate, put the relations of the British Government with\r\nthe Amir, as regards Herat, upon a clear footing.'\r\n\r\nWhile this discussion was going on, the advance of a Persian army for\r\nthe purpose of besieging Herat, coupled with the insults offered to\r\nthe British flag at Teheran, led to the declaration of war between\r\nEngland and Persia. The Chief Commissioner was therefore directed to\r\ntell the Amir that he would be paid a periodical subsidy to aid him\r\nin carrying on hostile operations against Persia, subject to certain\r\nconditions. On receiving these instructions, the Chief Commissioner\r\ndirected Edwardes to invite the Amir to an interview. Dost Mahomed\r\naccepted the invitation, but before the auspicious meeting could take\r\nplace Lord Dalhousie had left India, and Lord Canning reigned in his\r\nstead. Lord Dalhousie resigned on the 29th February, 1856, after\r\nhaving filled the arduous and responsible position of Governor-General\r\nfor no less than eight years, adding year by year fresh lustre to his\r\nsplendid reputation.\r\n\r\nThe first day of 1857 witnessed the meeting between the Amir of Kabul\r\nand the Chief Commissioner of the Punjab. The Amir's camp was pitched\r\nat the mouth of the Khyber Pass, and that of the Chief Commissioner on\r\nthe plain near Jamrud. Barr's troop of Horse Artillery formed part of\r\nthe escort, so I was in the midst of it all. On the occasion of the\r\nAmir's first visit to the English camp, there was a force present\r\nof upwards of 7,000 soldiers, including three regiments of British\r\nInfantry; the troops lined the road for more than a mile, and it was\r\nevident that their strength and soldierly appearance inspired the\r\nAmir and his followers with a very salutary feeling of awe and\r\nadmiration.[2]\r\n\r\nThe result of the conferences between these two great personages was\r\nan agreement confirming the treaty of the year before. In addition,\r\nthe Amir bound himself to keep up a certain number of regular troops\r\nfor the defence of Afghanistan, so long as the war with Persia\r\ncontinued, in consideration of a monthly subsidy of Rs. 100,000 and\r\na gift of 4,000 muskets. He also engaged to communicate to the\r\nGovernment of India any overtures he might receive from Persia, and\r\nhe consented to allow British officers to visit certain parts of his\r\ndominions, either for the purpose of assisting his subjects against\r\nPersia, or to ascertain that the subsidy was properly applied.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt at some length on this treaty with Afghanistan, first,\r\nbecause the policy of which this was the outcome was, as I have\r\nalready shown, initiated by my father; and, secondly, because I do not\r\nthink it is generally understood how important to us were its results.\r\nNot only did it heal the wounds left open from the first Afghan war,\r\nbut it relieved England of a great anxiety at a time when throughout\r\nthe length and breadth of India there was distress, revolt, bloodshed,\r\nand bitter distrust of our Native troops. Dost Mahomed loyally held\r\nto his engagements during the troublous days of the Mutiny which so\r\nquickly followed this alliance, when, had he turned against us, we\r\nshould assuredly have lost the Punjab; Delhi could never have been\r\ntaken; in fact, I do not see how any part of the country north of\r\nBengal could have been saved. Dost Mahomed's own people could not\r\nunderstand his attitude. They frequently came to him during the\r\nMutiny, throwing their turbans at his feet, and praying him as a\r\nMahomedan to seize that opportunity for destroying the 'infidels.'\r\n'Hear the news from Delhi,' they urged; 'see the difficulties the\r\nFeringhis are in. Why don't you lead us on to take advantage of their\r\nweakness, and win back Peshawar?'[3]\r\n\r\nBut I am anticipating, and must return to my narrative.\r\n\r\nThe clause of the treaty which interested me personally was that\r\nrelating to British officers being allowed to visit Afghanistan,\r\nto give effect to which a Mission was despatched to Kandahar. It\r\nconsisted of three officers, the brothers Harry and Peter Lumsden, and\r\nDr. Bellew, together with two of Edwardes's trusted Native Chiefs. The\r\nselection of Peter Lumsden as a member of this Mission again left the\r\nDeputy Assistant-Quartermaster-Generalship vacant, and I was a second\r\ntime appointed to officiate in his absence.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards the General of the division (General Reed) started\r\non his tour of inspection, taking me with him as his staff officer.\r\nJhelum was the first place we visited. Whether the sepoys had then\r\nany knowledge of what was so soon to happen is doubtful. If they had,\r\nthere was no evidence that such was the case. Nothing could have\r\nbeen more proper or respectful than their behaviour; no crimes were\r\nreported, no complaints were made. The British officers, certainly,\r\nhad not the slightest idea of the storm that was brewing, for they\r\nspoke in the warmest terms of their men.\r\n\r\nFrom Jhelum we went to Rawal Pindi. John Lawrence happened to be in\r\ncamp there at the time, and looked on at the General's inspection.\r\nAt the conclusion of the parade he sent his secretary to ask me if\r\nI would like to be appointed to the Public Works Department. I\r\nrespectfully declined the offer, though very grateful for its having\r\nbeen made. Some of my friends doubted the wisdom of my refusing\r\na permanent civil appointment; but it meant having to give up\r\nsoldiering, which I could not make up my mind to do, and though only\r\nofficiating, I was already in the department to which of all others I\r\nwished to belong.\r\n\r\nNowshera was the last station we visited. It was the beginning of\r\nApril, and getting rather hot for parading troops. I there met for the\r\nfirst time the present Commander-in-Chief in India, General Sir George\r\nWhite, who was then a subaltern in the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment.\r\n\r\nI recollect the commanding officer of the 55th, the Native Infantry\r\ncorps at this station, who had served all his life with clean-looking,\r\nclosely-shaven Hindustanis, pointing with a look of contempt, not to\r\nsay disgust, to some Sikhs (a certain proportion of whom had been\r\nunder recent orders enlisted in regiments of Native Infantry), and\r\nexpressing his regret that he could not get them to shave their beards\r\nand cut their hair. 'They quite spoil the look of my regiment,' he\r\nsaid. In less than two months' time the Hindustanis, of whom the\r\nColonel was so proud, had broken into open mutiny; the despised Sikhs\r\nwere the only men of the regiment who remained faithful; and the\r\ncommanding officer, a devoted soldier who lived for his regiment, and\r\nwho implored that his men might not have their arms taken away, as he\r\nhad 'implicit confidence' in them, and would 'stake his life on their\r\nfidelity,' had blown his brains out because he found that confidence\r\nmisplaced.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of April I was ordered to report on the capabilities\r\nof Cherat (now well known to all who have been stationed at Peshawar)\r\nas a sanatorium for European soldiers. I spent two or three days\r\nsurveying the hill and searching for water in the neighbourhood. It\r\nwas not safe to remain on the top at night, so I used to return each\r\nevening to the plain below, where my tent was pitched. On one occasion\r\nI was surprised to find a camp had risen up during my absence quite\r\nclose to my tent. I discovered that it belonged to Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nJohn Nicholson, the Deputy-Commissioner, who was on his tour of\r\ninspection, and very soon I received an invitation to dine with him,\r\nat which I was greatly pleased. John Nicholson was a name to conjure\r\nwith in the Punjab. I had heard it mentioned with an amount of\r\nrespect--indeed, awe--which no other name could excite, and I was all\r\ncuriosity to see the man whose influence on the frontier was so great\r\nthat his word was law to the refractory tribes amongst whom he lived.\r\nHe had only lately arrived in Peshawar, having been transferred from\r\nBannu, a difficult and troublesome district ruled by him as it had\r\nnever been ruled before, and where he made such a reputation for\r\nhimself that, while he was styled 'a pillar of strength on the\r\nfrontier' by Lord Dalhousie, he was looked up to as a god by the\r\nNatives, who loved as much as they feared him. By some of them he was\r\nactually worshipped as a saint; they formed themselves into a sect,\r\nand called themselves 'Nicholseyns.' Nicholson impressed me more\r\nprofoundly than any man I had ever met before, or have ever met since.\r\nI have never seen anyone like him. He was the beau-ideal of a soldier\r\nand a gentleman. His appearance was distinguished and commanding, with\r\na sense of power about him which to my mind was the result of his\r\nhaving passed so much of his life amongst the wild and lawless\r\ntribesmen, with whom his authority was supreme. Intercourse with\r\nthis man amongst men made me more eager than ever to remain on the\r\nfrontier, and I was seized with ambition to follow in his footsteps.\r\nHad I never seen Nicholson again, I might have thought that the\r\nfeelings with which he inspired me were to some extent the result of\r\nmy imagination, excited by the astonishing stories I had heard of his\r\npower and influence; my admiration, however, for him was immeasurably\r\nstrengthened when, a few weeks later, I served as his staff officer,\r\nand had opportunities of observing more closely his splendid soldierly\r\nqualities and the workings of his grand, simple mind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRIGADIER-GENERAL JOHN NICHOLSON, C.B.\r\n\r\n_From a painting by J.R. Dicksee, in the possession of the Reverend\r\nCanon Seymour._]\r\n\r\nIt was the end of April when I returned to Peshawar from Cherat, and\r\nrapidly getting hot. On the strength of being a D.A.Q.M.G., I had\r\nmoved into a better house than I had hitherto been able to afford,\r\nwhich I shared with Lieutenant Hovenden of the Engineers. We were\r\njust settling down and making ourselves comfortable for the long hot\r\nweather, when all our plans were upset by the breaking out of the\r\nMutiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See 'Memorials of the Life and Letters of Major-General\r\nSir Herbert Edwardes.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: 'Memorials of Major-General Sir Herbert Edwardes.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n1857\r\n\r\n  First tidings of the mutiny--Prompt action at Peshawar\r\n  --A bold policy--The Movable Column--An annoying occurrence\r\n  --I leave Peshawar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first threatenings of coming trouble were heard in the early part\r\nof 1857. During the months of February, March, and April, rumours\r\nreached us at Peshawar of mysterious _chupattis_ (unleavened cakes)\r\nbeing sent about the country with the object, it was alleged, of\r\npreparing the Natives for some forthcoming event. There was also an\r\nevident feeling of unrest and dissatisfaction in the minds of the\r\nsepoys. We heard that the 19th Native Infantry at Berhampur, a\r\nmilitary station about 100 miles from Calcutta, had broken open the\r\nbells-of-arms,[1] and forcibly taken possession of their muskets and\r\nammunition; that a sepoy named Mangal Pandy,[2] belonging to the 34th\r\nNative Infantry at Barrackpore, had attacked and severely wounded\r\nthe Adjutant and Sergeant-Major of his regiment; that it was found\r\nnecessary to disband the 19th on the 30th March, and the 34th on the\r\n6th May; that bungalows had been burnt in several stations; and\r\nthat the sepoys at the Schools of Musketry had objected to use the\r\ncartridges served out with the new rifles, because, it was asserted,\r\nthey were greased with a mixture of cow's fat and lard, the one being\r\nas obnoxious to the prejudices of the Hindu as the other is to those\r\nof the Mussulman.\r\n\r\nIt seems strange on looking back that these many warnings should have\r\npassed almost unheeded, and that there should have been no suspicion\r\namongst the officers serving with Native regiments that discontent was\r\nuniversal amongst the sepoys, and that a mutiny of the whole Bengal\r\nArmy was imminent. But at that time the reliance on the fidelity of\r\nthe Native troops was unbounded, and officers believed implicitly in\r\nthe contentment and loyalty of their men. Their faith in them was\r\nextraordinary. Even after half the Native army had mutinied and many\r\nofficers had been murdered, those belonging to the remaining regiments\r\ncould not believe that their own particular men could be guilty of\r\ntreachery.\r\n\r\nAt Peshawar there was not the slightest suspicion of the extent to\r\nwhich the evil had spread, and we were quite thunderstruck when, on\r\nthe evening of the 11th May, as we were sitting at mess, the telegraph\r\nsignaller rushed in breathless with excitement, a telegram in his\r\nhand, which proved to be a message from Delhi 'to all stations in the\r\nPunjab,' conveying the startling intelligence that a very serious\r\noutbreak had occurred at Meerut the previous evening, that some of\r\nthe troopers from there had already reached Delhi, that the Native\r\nsoldiers at the latter place had joined the mutineers, and that many\r\nofficers and residents at both stations had been killed.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Davidson, commanding the 16th Irregular Cavalry,\r\nwho happened to be dining at mess that evening, was the first to\r\nrecover from the state of consternation into which we were thrown\r\nby the reading of this telegram. He told us it was of the utmost\r\nimportance that the Commissioner and the General should at once be put\r\nin possession of this astounding news, and at the same time impressed\r\nupon us the imperative necessity for keeping it secret.\r\n\r\nDavidson then hurried off to the Commissioner, who with his deputy,\r\nNicholson, lived within a stone's-throw of the mess. Edwardes drove at\r\nonce to the General's house, while Nicholson came to our mess. He too\r\npointed out to us the importance of preventing the news from getting\r\nabout and of keeping it as long as possible from the Native soldiers.\r\n\r\nWe had at Peshawar three regiments of Native Cavalry and five of\r\nNative Infantry, not less than 5,000 men, while the strength of the\r\ntwo British regiments and the Artillery did not exceed 2,000. This\r\nEuropean force was more than sufficient to cope with the eight Native\r\ncorps, but in the event of any general disturbance amongst the Native\r\ntroops, we had to calculate on the probability of their being joined\r\nby the 50,000 inhabitants of the city, and, indeed, by the entire\r\npopulation of the Peshawar valley; not to speak of the tribes all\r\nalong the border, who were sure to rise.\r\n\r\nIt was an occasion for the gravest anxiety, and the delay of even a\r\nfew hours in the sepoys becoming aware of the disastrous occurrences\r\nat Meerut and Delhi meant a great deal to us.\r\n\r\nFortunately for India, there were good men and true at Peshawar in\r\nthose days, when hesitation and irresolution would have been\r\nfatal, and it is worthy of note that they were comparatively young\r\nmen--Edwardes was thirty-seven, Nicholson thirty-five; Neville\r\nChamberlain, the distinguished Commandant of the Punjab Frontier Force\r\n(who was hastily summoned from Kohat, where he happened to be on his\r\ntour of inspection), was thirty-seven; and the Brigadier, Sydney\r\nCotton, though much older, being sixty-five, was not only\r\nexceptionally young for his years and full of energy and intelligence,\r\nbut actually much younger than the average of General officers\r\ncommanding stations in India.\r\n\r\nAt once, on hearing of the Mutiny, Edwardes, acting in unison with\r\nNicholson, sent to the post-office and laid hands on all Native\r\ncorrespondence; the letters they thus secured showed but too plainly\r\nhow necessary was this precaution. The number of seditious papers\r\nseized was alarmingly great; they were for the most part couched in\r\nfigurative and enigmatical language, but it was quite sufficiently\r\nclear from them that every Native regiment in the garrison was more or\r\nless implicated and prepared to join the rebel movement.\r\n\r\nA strong interest attaches to these letters, for they brought to light\r\nthe true feeling of the Natives towards us at the time, and it was\r\nevident from them that the sepoys had really been made to believe that\r\nwe intended to destroy their caste by various unholy devices, of\r\nwhich the issue of contaminating cartridges was one. The seeds of\r\ndisaffection had been sown by agitators, who thought they saw an\r\nopportunity for realizing their hope of overthrowing our rule,\r\nmaintained as it was by a mere handful of Europeans in the midst of a\r\nvast population of Asiatics. This feeling of antagonism, only guessed\r\nat before, was plainly revealed in these letters, never intended to\r\nmeet the European eye. Some corps did not appear to be quite so guilty\r\nas others, but there could now be no doubt that all were tainted with\r\ndisloyalty, and that none of the Hindustani troops could any longer be\r\ntrusted.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of Tuesday, the 12th May, I received a note from the\r\nGeneral commanding the division directing me to present myself at his\r\nhouse the following morning, which I accordingly did. Besides General\r\nReed I found there the Brigadier, Sydney Cotton; the Commissioner,\r\nHerbert Edwardes; the Deputy Commissioner, John Nicholson;\r\nBrigadier Neville Chamberlain, and Captain Wright, Deputy\r\nAssistant-Adjutant-General, who, like myself, had been summoned to\r\nrecord the decisions that might be arrived at.\r\n\r\nThis meeting was a most momentous one, and I remember being greatly\r\nimpressed with the calm and comprehensive view of the situation taken\r\nby Edwardes and Nicholson. They had already been in communication with\r\nthe Chief Commissioner, and had, previous to the meeting, received a\r\ntelegram from him approving generally of the several proposals they\r\ncontemplated. John Lawrence also informed them that the authorities\r\nat Lahore had decided on disarming the Native troops at Mian Mir that\r\nvery morning.\r\n\r\nThe problem to be solved was how the Punjab could best be made secure\r\nwith the small force of British troops available--all told not more\r\nthan 15,000, with 84 guns--against upwards of 65,000 Natives (of whom\r\n42,000 were Hindustanis), with 62 guns.[3] In all stations Native\r\ntroops preponderated, and in some there were no European soldiers at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nEdwardes and Nicholson gave it as their opinion that the only chance\r\nof keeping the Punjab and the frontier quiet lay in trusting the\r\nChiefs and people, and in endeavouring to induce them to side with us\r\nagainst the Hindustanis. They undertook to communicate, regarding\r\nthe raising of levies and fresh troops, with their friends and\r\nacquaintances along the border, who had proved such staunch allies in\r\n1848-49, when we were fighting with the Sikhs. How nobly these loyal\r\nmen responded to the demand made upon them, and how splendidly the\r\nfrontier and Punjab soldiers whom they brought to our assistance\r\nbehaved, will be seen hereafter.\r\n\r\nAmongst other matters of importance, it was proposed by those two able\r\nsoldier-civilians, Edwardes and Nicholson, that General Reed, as the\r\nsenior officer in the Punjab, should join the Chief Commissioner at\r\nRawal Pindi, leaving Brigadier Cotton in command at Peshawar; that a\r\nMovable Column, composed of reliable troops, should be organized\r\nat some convenient place in the Punjab,[4] prepared to move in any\r\ndirection where its services might be required; that the Hindustani\r\nregiments should be scattered as much as possible, in order to prevent\r\ndangerous combinations; that a detachment of Punjab Infantry from\r\nKohat should replace the Hindustani sepoys in the fort of Attock,\r\nwhich was a very important position, as it contained a magazine, and\r\ncovered the passage of the Indus; and that a small guard of Pathan\r\nlevies, under a tried and trusty frontier Native officer, should be\r\nplaced in charge of the Attock ferry.\r\n\r\nAll these proposals were cordially and unanimously agreed to by the\r\nmilitary authorities present.\r\n\r\nThe question of the command of the Movable Column was then discussed.\r\nIt was considered essential that the officer selected should, in\r\naddition to other necessary qualifications, have considerable\r\nexperience of the country, and an intimate knowledge of Native\r\nsoldiers. It was no ordinary command. On the action of the Movable\r\nColumn would depend, to a great extent, the maintenance of peace and\r\norder throughout the Punjab, and it was felt that, at such a crisis,\r\nthe best man must be selected, irrespective of seniority. It was a\r\nposition for which Cotton and Nicholson would have given much, and for\r\nwhich they were well qualified, but there was important work for them\r\nto do at Peshawar. Neville Chamberlain was available, and there was\r\na general consensus of opinion that he should be appointed. It was\r\nnecessary, however, to refer the matter to the Chief Commissioner,\r\nwith a request that he would submit it for the orders of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief. This course was adopted, and in a few hours a\r\nreply was received from General Anson nominating Chamberlain to the\r\ncommand. My anxiety as to the Commander-in-Chief's decision was very\r\nconsiderable; for Brigadier Chamberlain, to my infinite delight and\r\nastonishment, had offered, in the event of his being appointed, to\r\ntake me with him as his staff officer--the most wonderful piece of\r\ngood fortune that could have come to me; my readers must imagine\r\nmy feelings, for it is impossible for me to describe them. My most\r\nsanguine hopes seemed about to be more than realized; for though the\r\nserious aspect of affairs seemed to promise the chance of active\r\nservice, I little thought that I should be lucky enough to be employed\r\nas the staff officer of such a distinguished soldier as Neville\r\nChamberlain.\r\n\r\nWhen the meeting was over I was ordered to take the several messages,\r\nwhich Wright and I had written out, to the telegraph office, and see\r\nthem despatched myself; as they disclosed more or less the measures\r\nthat had been decided upon, it was necessary to avoid any chance of\r\ntheir falling into the hands of Native clerks. One of the messages[5]\r\ncontained a summary of the proceedings of the council, and was\r\naddressed to the commanding officers of all stations in the Punjab,\r\nwith the view of imparting confidence, and letting them know what\r\nsteps were being taken for the protection of the British residents\r\nthroughout the province. This duty having been carried out, I returned\r\nhome in a not unpleasant frame of mind, for though the crisis was a\r\ngrave one, the outlook gloomy, and the end doubtful, the excitement\r\nwas great. There were stirring times in store for us, when every man's\r\npowers would be tested, and the hopefulness of youth inclined me to\r\nlook only on the bright side of the situation.\r\n\r\nMy equanimity was somewhat disturbed later in the day by an occurrence\r\nwhich caused me a good deal of annoyance at the time, though it\r\nsoon passed away. Nicholson came to my house and told me that the\r\nproceedings at the meeting that morning had in some unaccountable\r\nmanner become known; and he added, much to my disgust, that it was\r\nthought I might perhaps have been guilty of the indiscretion of\r\ndivulging them. I was very angry, for I had appreciated as much as\r\nanyone the immense importance of keeping the decisions arrived at\r\nperfectly secret; and I could not help showing something of the\r\nindignation I felt at its having been thought possible that I could\r\nbetray the confidence reposed in me. I denied most positively having\r\ndone so; upon which Nicholson suggested that we should proceed\r\ntogether to the telegraph office and see whether the information\r\ncould have leaked out from there. The signaller was a mere boy, and\r\nNicholson's imposing presence and austere manner were quite too much\r\nfor him; he was completely cowed, and, after a few hesitating denials,\r\nhe admitted having satisfied the curiosity of a friend who had\r\ninquired of him how the authorities intended to deal with the\r\ncrisis. This was enough, and I was cleared. The result to me of this\r\nunpleasant incident was a delightful increase of intimacy with the\r\nman for whom above all others I had the greatest admiration and most\r\nprofound respect. As if to make up for his momentary injustice,\r\nNicholson was kinder to me than ever, and I felt I had gained in him a\r\nfirm and constant friend. So ended that eventful day.\r\n\r\nAt that time it was the custom for a staff officer, who had charge of\r\nany Government property, to have a guard of Native soldiers in charge\r\nof his house. That night it happened that my guard was furnished\r\nby the 64th Native Infantry, a regiment with a particularly bad\r\nreputation, and which had, in order to give effect to the measures\r\nproposed at the morning's meeting, been ordered to leave Peshawar and\r\nproceed to the outposts. The intercepted letters showed that this\r\nregiment was on the point of mutinying, and I could not help feeling,\r\nas I lay down on my bed, which, as usual in the hot weather, was\r\nplaced in the verandah for the sake of coolness, how completely I was\r\nat the mercy of the sentry who walked up and down within a few feet of\r\nme. Fortunately, he was not aware that his regiment was suspected, and\r\ncould not know the reason for the sudden order to march, or my career\r\nmight have been ended then and there.\r\n\r\nWithin a week from that time I had started for Rawal Pindi to be ready\r\nto join the Movable Column, which was to be formed at Wazirabad as\r\nsoon as the troops could be got together. I took with me only just\r\nenough kit for a hot-weather march, and left everything standing in my\r\nhouse just as it was, little thinking that I should never return to it\r\nor be quartered in Peshawar again.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Place where the arms and accoutrements of Native\r\nregiments were kept.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: This name was the origin of the sepoys generally being\r\ncalled Pandies.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: At Meerut, Delhi, and Rurki, and in the Punjab there\r\nwere:\r\n\r\n                 _British Troops._\r\n\r\n                                     MEN.

There were\r\nprobably not more than 15,000 British soldiers in the Punjab available\r\nfor duty in May, 1857.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The original proposal was that the Movable Column should\r\nbe formed at Jhelum, and composed of the 24th Foot from Rawal Pindi,\r\nthe 27th Foot from Nowshera, a troop of Horse Artillery from Peshawar,\r\na Native Field Battery from Jhelum, the Guides from Murdan, the 16th\r\nIrregular Cavalry from Rawal Pindi, the Kumaon battalion from Murree,\r\nthe 1st Punjab Infantry from Bannu, and a wing of the 2nd Punjab\r\nCavalry from Kohat. But events developed so rapidly that before the\r\ncolumn was formed every one of these troops was otherwise employed. It\r\nwas thought unwise to unduly weaken the Peshawar valley; the troop of\r\nHorse Artillery, therefore, stood fast, the 27th Foot was halted at\r\nAttock, and the 24th Foot and Kumaon battalion were kept at their\r\nstations ready to move towards the frontier. The Guides, 2nd Punjab\r\nCavalry, and 1st Punjab Infantry were ordered to Delhi, and the 16th\r\nIrregular Cavalry and the Native Field Battery were not considered\r\nsufficiently loyal to be employed on such a duty. Eventually, the\r\ncolumn was formed of one troop of Horse Artillery, one Field Battery,\r\nand one Infantry regiment, all British and all from Sialkot.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The full text of the message was as follows:\r\n\r\n    'To Sir John Lawrence, Rawal Pindi, the Commander-in-Chief, Simla,\r\n    and officers commanding all stations in the Punjab respectively;\r\n    to be forwarded by the assistant in charge of the telegraph\r\n    office, or post, as the case may be.\r\n\r\n    'The senior military officer in the Punjab, Major-General Reed,\r\n    having this morning received news of the disarming of the troops\r\n    at Mian Mir, a council of war was held, consisting of General\r\n    Reed, Brigadier Cotton, Brigadier Neville Chamberlain, Colonel\r\n    Edwardes, and Colonel Nicholson, and the following measures were\r\n    decided on, subject to the confirmation of the Commander-in-Chief.\r\n    General Reed assumes the chief military command in the Punjab;\r\n    his Head-Quarters will be the Head-Quarters of the Punjab Civil\r\n    Government, and a Movable Column will be formed at Jhelum at once,\r\n    consisting of [the troops were here detailed].

One of\r\nthese depots was at Dum-Dum, and as early as the 24th January General\r\nHearsay, commanding the Presidency division, reported to Head-Quarters\r\nthat he perceived an 'unpleasant feeling' amongst the Native soldiers\r\nlearning the new drill, caused by a belief instilled into them 'by\r\ndesigning persons, most likely Brahmins,' that they were to be forced\r\nto embrace Christianity, and that for the furtherance of this object\r\nthe new ball-cartridges received from the arsenal at Fort William were\r\ngreased with the fat of pigs and cows, with the intention of violating\r\nthe religious prejudices and destroying the caste of those who would\r\nhave to bite them.\r\n\r\nA little later various acts of incendiarism took place at other\r\nstations in the command, and Hearsay became more than ever convinced\r\nthat there was grave dissatisfaction amongst the troops. He therefore\r\nordered a Court of Inquiry to be held to enable him to ascertain the\r\nreal cause of the ill-feeling which so evidently existed.\r\n\r\nIn the General's opinion, the statements recorded in the proceedings\r\nof this Court clearly established the fact, that the Native officers\r\nand sepoys were undoubtedly imbued with the belief that an unholy\r\nmixture of cow's fat and lard had been used in the manufacture of the\r\nnew cartridge, and he recommended that the rifle ammunition should in\r\nfuture be made up with the same description of paper that had always\r\nbeen used for the musket-cartridge, which, he conceived, would put an\r\nend to their suspicions and uneasiness.\r\n\r\nThe General, however, was told in reply that it was impossible to use\r\nthe old paper for the new cartridge, as the bore of the rifle being\r\nmuch smaller than that of the musket, thinner paper was indispensable;\r\nand he was directed to inform the sepoys that the new paper, though\r\ntougher and less bulky, was made of exactly the same material as the\r\nold. With respect to the lubricating mixture, he was to announce that\r\nthe Government had authorized the preparation of a grease, composed of\r\nwax and oil, which was to be made up and applied to the cartridges\r\nby the men themselves. These orders were carefully explained to the\r\nNative troops, but without any good result. Their religious objection\r\nto the new cartridge was not removed, and they frankly acknowledged\r\ntheir fears.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th February an officer of the 34th Native Infantry at\r\nBarrackpore was informed by a sepoy of his company that the four\r\nNative regiments at that station, fearing that they would be forced\r\nto destroy their caste and become Christians, had determined to rise\r\nagainst their officers, and when they had plundered and burned their\r\nbungalows, to proceed to Calcutta and try to seize Fort William,\r\nor, if that proved beyond their powers, to take possession of the\r\ntreasury.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance was reported to Government by General Hearsay on the\r\n11th February. In the same letter he said, 'We have at Barrackpore\r\nbeen living upon a mine ready for explosion,' and he reported a story\r\nwhich had reached him from Dum-Dum of a sepoy, on his way to cook\r\nhis food with his _lota_[1] full of water, meeting a low-caste man\r\nbelonging to the arsenal where the Enfield cartridges were being\r\nmanufactured. This man, it was said, asked the sepoy to allow him to\r\ndrink from his _lota_. The sepoy, a Brahmin, refused, saying: 'I have\r\nscoured my _lota_; you will defile it by your touch.' The low-caste\r\nman replied: 'You think much of your caste, but wait a little: the\r\n_Sahib-logue_[2] will make you bite cartridges soaked in cow's fat,\r\nand then where will your caste be?' The sepoy no doubt believed the\r\nman, and told his comrades what was about to happen, and the report\r\nrapidly spread to other stations.\r\n\r\nEarly in March several of the Hindu sepoys belonging to the Dum-Dum\r\nSchool of Musketry expressed their unwillingness to bite the new\r\ncartridge, and the Commandant proposed that the drill should be\r\naltered so as to admit of the cartridge being torn instead of bitten.\r\nHearsay supported the proposal, remarking that the new mode of loading\r\nneed not be made to appear as a concession to agitation, but as part\r\nof the drill for the new weapon. Events, however, moved so quickly\r\nthat, before sanction could be received to this suggestion, the troops\r\nat Berhampur had broken into open mutiny. They refused to receive\r\ntheir ammunition, on the ground of its being polluted, even after\r\nit was explained to them that they were not being given the new\r\ncartridges, but those which had been made up in the regiment a year\r\nbefore. That night they broke open the bells-of-arms, and carried off\r\ntheir muskets.\r\n\r\nThe Government then became aware that prompt action was necessary.\r\nThey decided that such open mutiny could not be excused on the grounds\r\nof religious scruples, and ordered the regiment to be disbanded. As\r\nBerhampur was somewhat isolated, and some distance from European\r\ntroops, it was arranged that the disbandment should take place at the\r\nHead-Quarters of the Presidency division, and the 19th Native Infantry\r\nwas accordingly ordered to march to Barrackpore.\r\n\r\nThe revolt of this regiment brought forcibly before Lord Canning and\r\nhis advisers the perilous position of Lower Bengal, owing to the\r\npaucity of European troops. Well may the authorities have been\r\nstartled, for between Calcutta and Meerut, a distance of 900 miles,\r\nthere were only four regiments of British infantry and a few scattered\r\nArtillerymen, numbering in all less than 5,000, while the Native\r\ntroops amounted to upwards of 55,000. One of the four Infantry\r\nregiments was at Fort William; but as only a portion of it could\r\nbe spared for the disbandment of the 19th, a special steamer was\r\ndespatched to Rangoon to bring over the 84th Foot. This regiment\r\nreached Calcutta on the 20th March, and on the 31st the disbandment of\r\nthe mutinous Native Infantry regiment was carried out. The men were\r\npaid up and escorted across the river Hughly, whence they were allowed\r\nto proceed to their homes. They behaved in the most orderly manner on\r\nthe march from Berhampur and throughout the proceedings, and as they\r\nleft the parade-ground they cheered General Hearsay, and wished him a\r\nlong life, apparently well pleased at being let off so easily.\r\n\r\nAt Barrackpore itself an outbreak had occurred two days before in the\r\n34th Native Infantry. As I have already related, the sepoy, Mangal\r\nPandy, shot at the sergeant-major.[3] The Adjutant, on hearing\r\nwhat had happened, galloped to the parade-ground. As he neared the\r\nquarter-guard he was fired at, and his horse shot by the mutineer, who\r\nthen badly wounded him with a sword as he was trying to disentangle\r\nhimself from the fallen animal. The General now appeared on the scene,\r\nand, instantly grasping the position of affairs, rode straight at\r\nMangal Pandy, who stood at bay with his musket loaded, ready to\r\nreceive him. There was a shot, the whistle of a bullet, and a man fell\r\nto the ground--but not the General; it was the fanatic sepoy himself,\r\nwho at the last moment had discharged the contents of his musket into\r\nhis own breast! The wretched man had been worked up to a pitch of\r\nmadness by the sepoys of his regiment, who stood by while he attacked\r\nthe Adjutant, and would have allowed him to kill their Commander, but\r\nthey were too great cowards to back him up openly. Mangal Pandy was\r\nnot dead. He was taken to the hospital, and eventually was tried by\r\na Court-Martial composed of Native officers, sentenced to death, and\r\nhanged in the presence of all the troops at Barrackpore. The Native\r\nofficer in command of the quarter-guard met the same fate, and the\r\nregiment was then disbanded.\r\n\r\nThe orders for the disbandment of the 19th and 34th Native Infantry\r\nwere directed to be read to every Native corps in the service, and\r\nit was hoped that the quick retribution which had overtaken these\r\nregiments would check the spirit of mutiny throughout the army. For\r\na time this hope appeared to be justified. Satisfactory reports were\r\nreceived from different parts of Bengal, and anything like a serious\r\nor general outbreak was certainly not contemplated by the authorities.\r\nGeneral Hearsay reported to Government that he had directed the\r\nEuropean troops, temporarily located at Barrackpore, to return to\r\ntheir respective cantonments, as he did not think it probable that\r\nhe would require their presence again. About the same time Sir John\r\nLawrence, after visiting the Musketry School at Sialkot, wrote\r\nhopefully to the Governor-General of the aspect of affairs in the\r\nPunjab. Lord Canning and his advisers, owing to these favourable\r\nreports, were on the point of sending the 84th Foot back to Burma,\r\nwhen news reached them from Upper India of the calamitous occurrences\r\nat Meerut and Delhi.\r\n\r\nThe Meerut division was commanded by Major-General Hewitt, an officer\r\nof fifty years' service, and the station of Meerut by Brigadier\r\nArchdale Wilson, Commandant of the Bengal Artillery. The garrison\r\nconsisted of the 6th Dragoon Guards, a troop of Horse Artillery, a\r\nbattery of Field Artillery, a company of Foot Artillery, the 1st\r\nBattalion 60th Rifles, and three Native corps--the 3rd Light Cavalry,\r\nand the 11th and 20th Native Infantry.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of April incendiary fires began to take place, and\r\nthe Native soldiers evinced more or less disrespect in their manner\r\ntowards their officers. These signs of disaffection were followed\r\nby the refusal of some of the troopers of the 3rd Light Cavalry to\r\nreceive their cartridges, although the commanding officer carefully\r\nexplained to them that they were not the new cartridges, but the very\r\nsame they had always used, and that according to the new drill they\r\nwere not required to bite them when loading their carbines.\r\n\r\nA Court of Inquiry was held to investigate the matter, composed\r\nentirely of Native officers, three of whom belonged to the offending\r\nregiment. The verdict of the Court was that no adequate cause could be\r\nassigned for the disobedience of orders in refusing to receive and use\r\nthe cartridges that were served out. 'The only conclusion the Court\r\ncan arrive at in regard to this point is that a report seems to have\r\ngot abroad which in some vague form attaches suspicion of impurity\r\nto the materials used for making these cartridges, but the Court are\r\nunanimously of opinion that there is nothing whatever objectionable in\r\nthe cartridges of the 3rd Regiment Light Cavalry, and that they may be\r\nfreely received and used as heretofore without in the slightest degree\r\naffecting any religious scruple of either a Hindu or Mussulman, and if\r\nany pretence contrary to that is urged, that it must be false.' This\r\nopinion, it must be remembered, was the opinion of Natives, not\r\nEuropeans, and was given only sixteen days before the outbreak\r\noccurred at Meerut.\r\n\r\nAfter carefully reviewing the evidence brought before the Court, and\r\nconsidering the opinion expressed by the Native officers who composed\r\nit, the Commander-in-Chief decided to try the eighty-five men who had\r\nrefused to receive the cartridges by a General Court-Martial composed\r\nentirely of their own countrymen. The Court was formed of six\r\nMahomedans and nine Hindus, six Native officers being brought over\r\nfrom Delhi for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were tried on the 8th May, found guilty, and sentenced\r\nto imprisonment with hard labour for ten years.\r\n\r\nThe following morning there was a parade of the whole of the Meerut\r\ngarrison, and the finding and sentence of the Court were read to the\r\nmen. The eighty-five troopers were then stripped of their uniform and\r\nfetters were fastened on their ankles. As each culprit was marched\r\nforward, he called on his comrades to rescue him, but no response came\r\nfrom the ranks; and when the ceremony was finished the prisoners were\r\nmarched down the line and escorted to the gaol. In his report of the\r\nparade to Army Head-Quarters, General Hewitt stated that 'the majority\r\nof the prisoners seemed to feel acutely the degradation to which their\r\nfolly and insubordination had brought them. The remainder of the\r\ntroops are behaving steady and soldier-like.'\r\n\r\nThe action of the Meerut authorities in putting the prisoners in irons\r\non the parade-ground, in the presence of their regiment, before\r\nbeing made over to the civil power, met with the disapproval of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief and the Governor-General. The former expressed his\r\nregret at the unusual procedure. The latter was more pronounced, and\r\nthus expressed himself: 'The riveting of the men's fetters on parade,\r\noccupying, as it did, several hours, in the presence of many who were\r\nalready ill-disposed and many who believed in the cartridge fable,\r\nmust have stung the brigade to the quick. The consigning the\r\neighty-five prisoners after such a ceremony to gaol with no other than\r\na Native guard over them was folly that is inconceivable.'\r\n\r\nThe procedure was no doubt unusual, and it certainly was most\r\nimprudent, under the circumstances, to trust the gaol to a Native\r\nguard. I think also, considering the number of the prisoners, and the\r\nlength of time necessary for riveting the fetters, that it was not\r\njudicious to subject the troops to such a severe and protracted\r\ntrial of their nerves and patience; but, before acquiescing in Lord\r\nCanning's sweeping condemnation, it should be considered that the\r\nobject of the punishment was to produce a deterrent effect on those\r\nwho were likely to follow the bad example that had been set them,\r\nand as the offence of the troopers had been public and ostentatious,\r\nGeneral Hewitt no doubt thought it right to make the punishment as\r\nmarked and public as possible.\r\n\r\nThe next day was Sunday, and outwardly the cantonment of Meerut\r\nhad assumed its usual appearance of Sabbath calm; but there was an\r\nundercurrent of unrest--there was considerable commotion in the Native\r\nbazaars, which were unusually crowded, and had not the European\r\nofficers been blinded by over-confidence in their men, signs might\r\nhave been perceived amongst the Native soldiers of preparation for\r\nsome untoward event.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the day before the storm burst. The Chaplain of Meerut\r\ntells us that he was about to start with his wife for evening service,\r\nwhen the Native nurse warned them of coming danger, beseeching her\r\nmistress to remain indoors, and, on being asked to explain, saying\r\nthere would be a fight with the sepoys. The idea seemed incredible,\r\nand the Chaplain would have paid no attention to the warning had not\r\nhis wife been greatly alarmed. At her earnest request he took his two\r\nchildren with them in the carriage, instead of leaving them in the\r\nhouse with the _ayah_, as had been intended. It was soon apparent that\r\nthe _ayah_ had not spoken without reason, for before the church was\r\nreached sounds of musketry were heard and columns of smoke were\r\nseen rising above the quarter occupied by the Native troops. As the\r\nChaplain arrived at the church enclosure, the buglers of the 60th\r\nRifles, who were drawn up ready to enter the church, sounded the\r\n'alarm' and the 'assembly.' The parade was dismissed, and as the\r\nBritish soldiers rushed to the barracks for their arms and ammunition,\r\nthe congregation rapidly dispersed, some to their homes, others to\r\nseek safety in the nearest quarter-guard.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom before the Mutiny for our soldiers to attend Divine\r\nService unarmed, save with their side-arms. The Native soldiers were\r\naware of this, and they no doubt calculated on the 60th Rifles being\r\nsafe and almost defenceless inside the church as soon as the bells\r\nceased tolling. What they were not aware of was the fact that, owing\r\nto the lengthening days and the increasing heat, the evening church\r\nparade had been ordered half an hour later than on the previous\r\nSunday. The mutineers therefore showed their hand half an hour too\r\nsoon, and as they galloped down the 60th Rifles lines they came upon\r\nthe men fully armed and rapidly falling in. Being thus disappointed in\r\ntheir hope of surprising the white soldiers, the 3rd Cavalry proceeded\r\nwithout a moment's delay to the gaol, broke into the cells, and\r\nreleased their eighty-five comrades and all the other prisoners, about\r\n1,200 in number.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on, the two Native Infantry regiments assembled\r\non their respective parade-grounds in wild excitement, discharging\r\ntheir muskets at random, and setting fire to their own huts. The\r\nBritish officers, hearing the tumult, hastened to their lines and did\r\ntheir best to restore order, but in vain. The sepoys had gone too\r\nfar, and were absolutely deaf to threats and entreaties. They did not\r\nattack their own officers, but warned them to get away, telling them\r\nthe Company's '_raj_'[4] was at an end. Their clemency, however, did\r\nnot extend to officers of other regiments.\r\n\r\nColonel Finnis, who had served forty years with the sepoys, and firmly\r\nbelieved in their loyalty, was the first victim; he fell riddled with\r\nbullets from a volley fired by the 20th, while exhorting the men of\r\nhis own regiment (the 11th) to be true to their salt. The work of\r\ndestruction then began in earnest, in which the population from the\r\nbazaars and the neighbouring villages eagerly joined, for (as the\r\nCommissioner reported) they were armed and ready for the onslaught\r\nbefore the sepoys commenced the attack, plainly showing how perfectly\r\nthey were aware of what was about to happen. They poured forth in\r\nthousands from every direction, and in a surprisingly short time\r\nalmost every bungalow belonging to a British officer serving with\r\nNative troops was gutted and burnt. Besides Colonel Finnis, seven\r\nofficers, three officers' wives, two children, and every stray\r\nEuropean man, woman and child in the outskirts of the cantonments were\r\nmassacred.\r\n\r\nIt was now time for the sepoys to think of themselves. They had thrown\r\noff all allegiance to the _Sarkar_;[5] they had been guilty of murder,\r\nrobbery, and incendiarism, and they knew that retribution must\r\nspeedily overtake them if they remained at Meerut; they therefore\r\nlost no time in making their escape towards Delhi. They had had ample\r\nopportunity for consultation with the Native officers from that\r\nstation, who had come to Meerut as members of the Court-Martial on the\r\nmen of the 3rd Light Cavalry, and they knew perfectly well that the\r\ntroops at Delhi were prepared to help them to seize the magazine and\r\nresuscitate the old Moghul dynasty. 'To Delhi! To Delhi!' was their\r\ncry, and off they went, leaving naught behind them in their lines\r\nbut the smouldering fires of their officers' houses and the lifeless\r\nbodies of their English victims.\r\n\r\nBut it will be asked, Where were the British troops? Where indeed?\r\nOn the alarm being given, the British troops got under arms 'in an\r\nincredibly short time,' but there was unaccountable delay in marching\r\nthem to the spot where their help was so greatly needed. The\r\nCarabineers occupied barracks within a few hundred yards of the Native\r\nInfantry lines, the 60th Rifles were only about a mile and a half\r\naway, and the Artillery lay just beyond the 60th. The Brigadier\r\n(Wilson) despatched one company of the Rifles to guard the treasury,\r\nanother he left to protect the barracks, and with the remainder,\r\naccompanied by the Carabineers and Artillery, he leisurely proceeded\r\ntowards the Native Infantry lines. It was almost dark when he arrived,\r\nbut there was light enough to discern, from the ruined houses and the\r\ndead bodies of the murdered officers lying about, in what a merciless\r\nspirit the revolt had been perpetrated. A few shots were fired from\r\nbehind the burning huts, but not a single living being was visible,\r\nexcept two or three Native troopers who were dimly perceptible in the\r\ndistance coming from the direction of the gaol, and it was evident\r\nthat the sepoys as a body had vanished. But whither? A lengthened\r\ndiscussion took place as to what was the best course to pursue, which\r\nonly resulted in the troops being marched back to their own end of the\r\ncantonment and bivouacking on the mall for the night. The General\r\nand Brigadier, misled by the tumult in the city, which they could\r\ndistinctly hear, came to the conclusion that the sepoys had\r\ncongregated within its walls and might shortly be expected to attack\r\nthat part of the station where the European residents chiefly lived.\r\nIt was not discovered till the next morning that all three Native\r\nregiments had made for Delhi.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to be wise after the event, but one cannot but feel that\r\nthere was unaccountable, if not culpable, want of energy displayed by\r\nthe Meerut authorities on this disastrous occasion. The officer\r\nin command was afterwards severely censured for not acting with\r\nsufficient promptitude on first hearing of the outbreak; for not\r\ntrying to find out where the mutineers had gone; and for not\r\nendeavouring to overtake them before they reached Delhi. The\r\nGovernment of India finally signified their disapproval by removing\r\nGeneral Hewitt from his command.\r\n\r\nWilson, the Brigadier, like everyone else at Meerut, appears to have\r\nbeen completely taken by surprise. But why this should have been the\r\ncase, after the warning that had been given by the mutinous conduct\r\nof the 3rd Cavalry, and why no steps should have been taken after the\r\nexasperating parade on the 9th to guard against a possible, if not\r\nprobable, outbreak, is difficult to understand; and can only be\r\naccounted for by that blind faith in the Native soldier, and disbelief\r\nin his intention or ability to revolt, which led to such unfortunate\r\nresults all over India.\r\n\r\nThe following story will exemplify how completely the authorities at\r\nMeerut were blinded by this misplaced confidence. On the afternoon of\r\nthe 9th the British officers of the 3rd Light Cavalry went to the gaol\r\nto pay up the prisoners belonging to their regiment. When Lieutenant\r\nHugh Gough,[6] who was one of these officers, returned to his house,\r\na Hindu Native officer, belonging to the troop Gough was temporarily\r\ncommanding, told him that the men had determined to rescue their\r\ncomrades, and that the Native guard over the gaol had promised to help\r\nthem. Gough went at once to his commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nCarmichael Smyth, and reported what he had heard, but the Colonel\r\npooh-poohed the idea as ridiculous, and told Gough he must not give\r\ncredence to anything so monstrous.\r\n\r\nLater in the day Gough met Brigadier Wilson and told him of the\r\nwarning which had been given to him, without, however, producing any\r\nimpression; the information was received with the same contemptuous\r\ndisbelief displayed by Colonel Carmichael Smyth.\r\n\r\nThe following day (Sunday), late in the afternoon, the same Native\r\nofficer, attended by two troopers, galloped to Gough's house, shouting\r\nto him that the _hala_[7] had begun, and that the Native Infantry were\r\nfiring on their officers. Gough mounted his horse, and, accompanied by\r\nthe three Cavalry soldiers, proceeded as quickly as possible to the\r\nInfantry parade-ground, where he arrived just as the wild scene of\r\nexcitement and confusion I have before described was at its height.\r\nThe sepoys, some in uniform, some in their own Native clothes, were\r\nrushing about in the maddest disorder, yelling, shouting, and dancing\r\nas if possessed, while the flames from the burning huts shed a lurid\r\nlight on the demoniacal proceedings.\r\n\r\nWhen Gough's party appeared in sight, the sepoys called to the three\r\ntroopers to get out of the way, as they wanted to shoot the _sahib_.\r\nNo notice being taken of this warning, they fired straight at the\r\nwhole party, but without hitting anyone. Gough, seeing things had gone\r\ntoo far for him to do any good, rode off with his little escort to\r\nhis own lines, where he found the men busy saddling their horses, and\r\nhelping themselves to ammunition from the regimental magazine, which\r\nthey had broken open. He endeavoured in vain to allay the excitement;\r\none or two shots were fired at him by recruits, but no determined\r\nattempt was made to take his life, and at last the Native officers\r\ncombined to force him away, saying they could no longer answer for his\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nIt was then all but dark. Gough rode off towards the European lines,\r\nstill accompanied by his trusty Native escort, and on his way came\r\nupon an enormous crowd of people from the bazaar, armed with swords,\r\nsticks, and anything they could get hold of, who tried to stop him.\r\nThrough these he charged, closely followed by the Native officer and\r\ntwo troopers, who did not leave him until he was within sight of\r\nthe Artillery mess. Then they pulled up, and said they could go no\r\nfurther. Gough did all he could to persuade them to remain with\r\nhim, but to no purpose. They told him it was impossible for them to\r\nseparate themselves from their friends and relations, and making the\r\nofficer they had so carefully protected a respectful salaam, they rode\r\noff to join their mutinous comrades. Gough never heard of them again,\r\nthough he tried hard to trace what had become of the men who proved\r\nthemselves such 'friends in need.'\r\n\r\nHowever much the authorities at Meerut deserved to be censured for\r\ntheir dilatoriness in dealing with the revolt in the first instance,\r\nand their lack of energy in not trying to discover in what direction\r\nthe mutineers had gone, I doubt whether anything would have been\r\ngained by following them up, or whether it would have been possible\r\nto overtake them before they reached Delhi. Only a very few European\r\nCavalry were available for pursuit, for the Carabineers, having lately\r\narrived in India, were composed mainly of recruits still in the\r\nriding-school, and their horses for the most part were quite unbroken.\r\nThese few, with the six Horse Artillery guns, might have been\r\ndespatched; but the mutineers had a considerable start, the Cavalry\r\ncould not have been overtaken, and as soon as the Infantry became\r\naware that they were being followed, they would have scattered\r\nthemselves over the country, the features of which were familiar to\r\nthem, and, favoured by the darkness, could have defied pursuit. Delhi\r\nis forty miles from Meerut, and it would not have been possible for\r\nthe 60th Rifles, marching in the terrible heat of the month of May, to\r\nhave reached that place before the next evening (the 11th), and, as\r\nwas afterwards ascertained, the work of murder and devastation there\r\nbegan on the morning of that day. The three Native Infantry regiments\r\nand the battery of Artillery stationed at Delhi were prepared to\r\njoin the insurgent troopers from Meerut directly they arrived. The\r\nmagazine, with its vast stores of war material, was in the hands of\r\nthe King, and the 150,000 inhabitants of the city were ready to assist\r\nin the massacre of the white men and women, and the destruction of\r\ntheir property.\r\n\r\nAfter careful consideration of all the circumstances of the revolt at\r\nMeerut, I have come to the conclusion that it would have been futile\r\nto have sent the small body of mounted troops available in pursuit of\r\nthe mutineers on the night of the 10th May, and that, considering\r\nthe state of feeling throughout the Native Army, no action, however\r\nprompt, on the part of the Meerut authorities could have arrested the\r\nMutiny. The sepoys had determined to throw off their allegiance to the\r\nBritish Government, and the when and the how were merely questions of\r\ntime and opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A metal drinking vessel, which the Hindu religiously\r\nguards against defilement, and to which he clings as a cherished\r\npossession when he has nothing else belonging to him in the world.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: European officers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Each Hindustani regiment had a European sergeant-major\r\nand quartermaster-sergeant.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Rule.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: British Government.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Now Lieutenant-General Sir Hugh Gough, V.C., G.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Tumult.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n1857\r\n\r\n  General Anson--The news reaches Simla--Anson loses no time\r\n  --A long list of troubles--John Lawrence--The Phulkian family\r\n  --Death of General Anson\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the events I have recounted were taking place, the\r\nCommander-in-Chief and the Head-Quarters staff were on their way up\r\ncountry inspecting the troops at the various stations _en route_ to\r\nSimla, at which place it had been arranged that the summer of 1857 was\r\nto be spent. The Commander-in-Chief in India at that time was General\r\nthe Hon. George Anson, an officer of forty-three years' service, but\r\nwithout much Indian experience, having been only four years in the\r\ncountry. He was an able, intelligent man, an excellent judge of\r\ncharacter, a great authority on whist and on horses, and he was well\r\nknown in London society, which was somewhat surprised when he accepted\r\nan appointment in India--the command of the Meerut division. He did\r\nnot, however, remain long in that position, for he was soon given\r\nthe command of the Madras Army, and a year and a half later became\r\nCommander-in-Chief in India. General Anson was present at Waterloo as\r\nan Ensign, but had seen no service afterwards, and until he arrived in\r\nIndia had held no high appointment.\r\n\r\nWhen the Commander-in-Chief left Calcutta the previous autumn, all was\r\napparently quiet in the Native army. He visited the principal military\r\nstations, amongst others Meerut and Delhi, and although reports of an\r\nuneasy feeling amongst the Native troops in the Presidency division\r\nhad reached him from time to time, it was not until he arrived at\r\nUmballa, about the middle of March, that these reports were confirmed\r\nby personal communication with the sepoys attending the School of\r\nMusketry which had been formed at that station.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the Commander-in-Chief's inspection of the School,\r\nhe learnt from the men of the various regiments under instruction how\r\nstrongly opposed they were to using a cartridge which they believed\r\nto be injurious to their caste. Anson listened attentively to all the\r\nsepoys had to say, and then explained to them in a manly, sensible\r\nspeech, that the old cartridge was not suited to the rifle about to be\r\nintroduced. A new cartridge had, therefore, to be made; but they must\r\nnot listen to any foolish rumour as to its being designed to destroy\r\ntheir caste. He assured them, 'on the honour of a soldier like\r\nthemselves,' that it had never been, and never could be, the policy of\r\nthe British Government to coerce the religious feeling of either the\r\nmilitary or the civil population of India, or to interfere in any way\r\nwith their caste or customs. He told the Native officers to do all in\r\ntheir power to allay the men's unfounded fears, and called upon them\r\nto prove themselves worthy of the high character they had hitherto\r\nmaintained; he concluded by warning all ranks that the Government were\r\ndetermined not to yield to insubordination, which would be visited\r\nwith the severest punishment.\r\n\r\nThe demeanour of the sepoys was most respectful, and when the parade\r\nwas over they expressed their high sense of the Commander-in-Chief's\r\ngoodness. They declared that he had removed their own objections,\r\nbut that the story was universally believed by their countrymen and\r\nrelations, and if they were to use the cartridge they must become\r\nsocial outcasts.\r\n\r\nGeneral Anson, feeling that the doubts and anxieties of the men with\r\nregard to the use of the new cartridges were by no means imaginary,\r\nsuspended their issue until a special report had been prepared as to\r\nthe composition of the paper in which they were wrapped.[1]\r\n\r\nHaving thus done all that he could at the time to allay any feeling of\r\nuneasiness, and hoping that the news of the disbandment of the 19th\r\nNative Infantry would check the spirit of insubordination, General\r\nAnson continued his journey to Simla, that beautiful place in the\r\nHimalayas, 7,000 feet above the sea, which has since become the seat\r\nof the Government of India and Army Head-Quarters during the hot\r\nweather months.\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief had been at Simla rather more than a month,\r\nwhen, on the afternoon of Tuesday, the 12th May, an Aide-de-camp\r\ngalloped in from Umballa (the Head-Quarters station of the Sirhind\r\ndivision), distant eighty miles, bringing with him a copy of the\r\ntelegraphic message which had been despatched from Delhi the previous\r\nday to 'all stations in the Punjab,' and which had caused such\r\nconsternation at Peshawar on the evening of the 11th May.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Barnard, commanding the Sirhind division, desired the\r\nAide-de-camp (his own son) to inform the Commander-in-Chief that\r\nthe temper of the three Native regiments at Umballa was more than\r\ndoubtful, and that it seemed advisable that the three regiments of\r\nBritish Infantry stationed in the hills near Simla should be ordered\r\nat once to Umballa. So urgent did this seem to Barnard, that, in\r\nanticipation of sanction from the Commander-in-Chief, he told his son\r\nto warn the 75th Foot as he passed through Kasauli to be prepared for\r\nan immediate move.\r\n\r\nGeneral Anson at once saw the necessity for taking prompt action. That\r\nsame afternoon he despatched an Aide-de-camp to Kasauli to order the\r\n75th to proceed without delay to Umballa, and the 1st Bengal Fusiliers\r\nat Dagshai to follow the 75th as soon as carriage could be collected;\r\nalso to warn the 2nd Bengal Fusiliers at Subathu to be ready to move.\r\nExpresses were sent at the same [time] to Ferozepore and Jullundur\r\ndirecting that a European guard should be placed in charge of the\r\nmagazine at the former place, and a detachment of European Infantry\r\nthrown into the fort of Philour from the latter. The confidence\r\nreposed in the Native army before the Mutiny was so great that these\r\ntwo important magazines, like almost all the arsenals and magazines in\r\nIndia, were guarded by Native soldiers, and subsequent events proved\r\nthat, but for General Anson's timely precautions, the mutineers\r\nmust have obtained possession of the magazines at Ferozepore and\r\nPhilour.[2]\r\n\r\nAnson had not long to wait before he received confirmation of the\r\nalarming news brought by General Barnard's son. The very next\r\nafternoon a letter arrived from Meerut giving an account of the\r\noutbreak on the 10th, and a few particulars of what had occurred at\r\nDelhi. The Commander-in-Chief immediately decided on proceeding to\r\nUmballa, to superintend personally the organization of the force\r\nwhich, as he rightly judged, would have to be sent to Delhi. There\r\nwas no hesitation on General Anson's part, or delay in issuing the\r\nnecessary orders.[3] The 2nd Bengal Fusiliers were directed to march\r\nto Umballa, and an Artillery officer was sent express to Philour with\r\ninstructions for a third-class siege-train to be got ready, and for\r\nreserve Artillery and Infantry ammunition to be despatched to Umballa.\r\nOrders were also issued for the Nasiri battalion, stationed at Jutog,\r\nnear Simla, and for the company of Native Artillery at Kangra and\r\nNurpur[4] to march with all expedition to Philour, for the purpose of\r\naccompanying the siege-train; and for the Sirmur battalion of Gurkhas\r\nat Dehra Dun, and the Sappers and Miners at Rurki, to proceed to\r\nMeerut.\r\n\r\nHaving thus pressed forward the measures for the suppression of the\r\nrevolt which to him seemed most urgent, General Anson left Simla early\r\non the 14th May, within forty-eight hours of the receipt of the first\r\nnews of the outbreak, and reached Umballa the following morning. His\r\nlast act at Simla was to draft a circular which he hoped would have\r\nthe effect of allaying excitement in the Native army.\r\n\r\nThe report which Sir Henry Barnard had to make to the Chief on his\r\narrival at Umballa was not reassuring. The troops at that station\r\nconsisted of Her Majesty's 9th Lancers, two troops of Horse Artillery,\r\nthe 4th Bengal Light Cavalry, and two regiments of Native Infantry.\r\nThe 75th Foot and 1st Bengal Fusiliers had just marched in with only\r\nthirty and seventy rounds of ammunition per man, respectively, and\r\n(from want of carriage) without tents or baggage. The Commissariat and\r\nMedical Departments were totally unprepared to meet the requirements\r\nof a force suddenly ordered to take the field; there were no doolies\r\nfor the sick; supplies were difficult to collect, for the bazaars\r\nwere partially deserted; there was a scarcity of contractors, and no\r\nammunition was available nearer than Philour, eighty miles off.\r\n\r\nAt Delhi all the Europeans who had not escaped had been massacred, and\r\nthe city had been taken possession of by the Native garrison and the\r\nmutinous troops from Meerut in the name of the old King.\r\n\r\nAt Meerut the European troops were entrenching themselves; the\r\nsurrounding district was in the most complete disorder, and the civil\r\ncourts powerless.\r\n\r\nAt Umballa and Jullundur, although the presence of European troops had\r\nhitherto kept the Native regiments from open mutiny, it was evident\r\nthat they were not in the least to be depended upon.\r\n\r\nAt Ferozepore an aggravated revolt had occurred, and at Lahore it had\r\nbeen found necessary to disarm all the Native troops.\r\n\r\nFrom below Meerut there was no intelligence whatever, but it seemed\r\nmore than probable that the spirit of rebellion had broken out in many\r\nstations, and later this was known to be the case.\r\n\r\nTo add to the Commander-in-Chief's anxieties, it was reported that the\r\nNasiri battalion at Jutog had got out of hand for a time and refused\r\nto march to Philour, while a detachment of the same corps at Kasauli\r\nplundered the treasury, rendering it necessary to send back 100 men\r\nof the 75th Foot to reinforce the depot at that place, where a large\r\nnumber of European soldiers' families were collected.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of the Gurkhas gave rise to a panic at Simla,\r\nwhich, however, did not last long. Lord William Hay,[5] who was\r\nDeputy-Commissioner at the time, induced most of the ladies,\r\nwith their children, to seek a temporary asylum with the Raja of\r\nKiunthal.[6] Hay himself managed to keep Simla quiet, and the men\r\nof the Nasiri battalion coming to their senses, order was restored\r\nthroughout the hills. The money taken from the Kasauli treasury was\r\nnearly all voluntarily given up, and before the year was out the\r\nbattalion did us good service.\r\n\r\nIt was a long list of troubles that was placed before the\r\nCommander-in-Chief. Disturbing as they all were, each requiring prompt\r\nand special action, there was one amongst them which stood out in bold\r\nrelief--the situation at Delhi; and to wrest that stronghold from the\r\nhands of the mutineers was, General Anson conceived, his most pressing\r\nobligation. But could it be done with the means at his disposal?\r\nHe thought not; and in this opinion he was supported by the senior\r\nofficers at Umballa, with whom the question was anxiously discussed at\r\na conference held at Sir Henry Barnard's house on the 16th May.[7] It\r\nwas nevertheless determined to push on to Delhi, and General Hewitt\r\nwas asked what force he could spare from Meerut to co-operate with the\r\nUmballa column. He was warned that time was an object, and that the\r\n23rd May was the date on which his troops would probably be required\r\nto start. All details were carefully considered. The first difficulty\r\nto be overcome was the want of carriage. No organized system of\r\ntransport--one of the most essential requirements of an efficient\r\narmy--existed, and, owing to the restlessness and uncertainty which\r\nprevailed throughout the country, the civil authorities were unable to\r\ncollect carts and camels with the usual rapidity.[8]\r\n\r\nThat afternoon General Anson received a letter from Sir John Lawrence\r\nurging the importance of an immediate advance on Delhi, and giving an\r\noutline of the measures he proposed to adopt in the Punjab. He asked\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief to give a general sanction to the arrangements,\r\nand concluded with these words: \"I consider this to be the greatest\r\ncrisis which has ever occurred in India. Our European force is so\r\nsmall that, unless effectively handled in the outset, and brought to\r\nbear, it will prove unequal to the emergency. But with vigour and\r\npromptitude, under the blessing of God, it will prove irresistible.\"\r\n\r\nAnson naturally hesitated to advance with an inefficient and only\r\npartially equipped force against a strongly-fortified city with\r\nan immense armed population, defended by many thousand desperate\r\nmutineers, and in his reply (dated the 17th May) he put the case\r\nplainly before Sir John Lawrence. He pointed out that the Europeans\r\nwere without tents; that there were no guns at Umballa or Meerut\r\nheavier than six or nine pounders with which to batter down the walls\r\nof Delhi; that the required amount of carriage could not be provided\r\nin less than sixteen or twenty days; and that the three Native corps\r\nat Umballa could not be depended upon. He asked Sir John whether he\r\nconsidered 'it would be prudent to risk the small European force we\r\nhave here in an enterprise against Delhi,' and he wrote: 'My own view\r\nof the state of things now is, by carefully collecting our resources,\r\nhaving got rid of the bad materials which we cannot trust, and having\r\nsupplied their places with others of a better sort, it would not be\r\nvery long before we could proceed, without a chance of failure, in\r\nwhatever direction we might please.' Adding, 'this is now the opinion\r\nof all here whom I have consulted--the Major-General and Brigadier,\r\nthe Adjutant-General, Quartermaster-General and Commissary-General.'\r\nAnson concluded his letter with the following words: 'It would give me\r\ngreat satisfaction to have your views upon the present crisis, for I\r\nwould trust to them more than to my experience.'\r\n\r\nJohn Lawrence, who was straining every nerve to check the Mutiny and\r\nprevent a general rising of the population, was impatient at the idea\r\nof delay, and lost no time in giving Anson his opinion. He telegraphed\r\nit briefly on the 20th, and the following day he wrote to the effect\r\nthat he knew Delhi well, having been stationed there for nearly\r\nthirteen years, and it seemed incredible to him that mutineers could\r\nhold and defend it; his belief was 'that, with good management on the\r\npart of the civil officers, it would open its gates on the approach of\r\nour troops.' He admitted that 'on military principles, in the present\r\nstate of affairs, it may not be expedient to advance on Delhi until\r\nthe Meerut force is prepared to act.' But he protested against\r\nEuropean soldiers being 'cooped up in their cantonments, tamely\r\nawaiting the progress of events.' He went on to say: 'Pray only\r\nreflect on the whole history of India. Where have we failed when\r\nwe acted vigorously? Where have we succeeded when guided by timid\r\ncounsels? Clive with 1,200 men fought at Plassy, in opposition to\r\nthe advice of his leading officers, beat 40,000 men, and conquered\r\nBengal.'\r\n\r\nThat Sir John Lawrence greatly under-estimated the difficulties which\r\nAnson had to overcome we now know. Delhi did not open its gates on our\r\napproach, but for more than three months defied all our efforts to\r\ncapture it. And in his eagerness to get the Commander-in-Chief\r\nto think as he did, the resolute Chief Commissioner forgot that\r\nClive--not with 1,200 men, but with 3,000 disciplined troops--had to\r\ndeal in the open field with an enemy little better than a rabble;\r\nwhereas Anson had to attack a strong fortress, amply supplied with\r\nstores and ammunition, possessing a powerful armament, and held\r\nby soldiers who were not only well trained and equipped, but were\r\nfighting for their lives, and animated by religious fanaticism.\r\n\r\nStill, there can be no doubt that John Lawrence's views as to the\r\nnecessity for Delhi being taken at all hazards were correct. The\r\nGovernor-General held the same opinion, and strongly urged it upon\r\nAnson, who loyally responded, and during the short time he remained at\r\nUmballa strenuously exerted himself to equip the troops destined for\r\nthe arduous task.\r\n\r\nWhile preparing for his advance on the Moghul capital, Anson did not\r\nneglect to provide, as far as lay in his power, for the safety of\r\nUmballa. The soldiers' wives and children were sent to Kasauli; a\r\nplace of refuge was made for the non-combatants at the church, round\r\nwhich an entrenchment was thrown; a garrison, about 500 strong, was\r\nformed of the sick and weakly men of the several European regiments,\r\nassisted by some of the Patiala troops; and as an additional security\r\nhalf the Native corps were sent into the district, and the other half\r\nwith the column to Delhi.\r\n\r\nJohn Lawrence had strongly advocated the policy of trusting the\r\nMaharaja of Patiala and the Rajas of Jhind and Nabha. The attitude of\r\nthese Chiefs was of extreme importance, for if they had not been well\r\ndisposed towards us, our communication with the Punjab would have been\r\nimperilled. There was therefore much anxiety at Umballa as to the\r\ncourse Patiala, Jhind, and Nabha (the three principal members of\r\nthe great Phulkian family) would elect to take. Douglas Forsyth,[9]\r\nDeputy-Commissioner of Umballa, who was a personal friend of the\r\nMaharaja of Patiala, at once sought an interview with him. He\r\nwas beginning to explain to the Maharaja the difficulties of the\r\nsituation, when he was interrupted by His Highness, who said he was\r\naware of all that had happened; on which Forsyth asked if it was\r\ntrue that emissaries from the King of Delhi had come to Patiala. The\r\nMaharaja pointed to some men seated at a little distance, saying,\r\n'There they are.' Forsyth then asked for a word in private. As soon as\r\nthey were alone, he addressed the Maharaja thus: 'Maharaja _sahib_,\r\nanswer me one question: Are you for us, or against us?' The Maharaja's\r\nreply was very hearty: 'As long as I live I am yours, but you know\r\nI have enemies in my own country; some of my relations are against\r\nme--my brother for one. What do you want done?' Forsyth then asked the\r\nMaharaja to send some of his troops towards Kurnal to keep open the\r\nGrand Trunk Road. The Maharaja agreed on the understanding that\r\nEuropeans should soon be sent to support them--a very necessary\r\ncondition, for he knew that his men could only be trusted so long as\r\nthere was no doubt of our ultimate success.\r\n\r\nPatiala was true to his word, and throughout the Mutiny the Phulkian\r\nChiefs remained perfectly loyal, and performed the important service\r\nof keeping open communication between Delhi and the Punjab.[10]\r\n\r\nOn the 19th May General Anson was cheered by hearing from John\r\nLawrence that the Corps of Guides and four trusty Punjab regiments\r\nwere proceeding by forced marches to join him. On the 21st he received\r\na message from the Governor-General informing him that European troops\r\nwere coming from Madras, Bombay, and Ceylon. He also heard of the\r\narrival of the siege-train at Umballa, and he had the satisfaction of\r\ntelegraphing to the Chief Commissioner that the first detachment of\r\nthe column destined for Delhi had started.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd the Commander-in-Chief communicated his plan of operations\r\nto General Hewitt. It was as follows: Two brigades were to advance\r\nfrom Umballa, commanded by Brigadier Hallifax of the 75th Foot, and\r\nColonel Jones of the 60th Rifles; and one brigade from Meerut, under\r\nthe command of Brigadier Archdale Wilson. The two former were to be\r\nconcentrated at Kurnal by the 30th May, and were then to advance,\r\nunder General Anson, so as to arrive opposite Baghput on the 5th June,\r\nat which place they were to be joined by the Meerut brigade, and the\r\nunited force was then to proceed to Delhi.\r\n\r\nAll his arrangements being now completed, Anson left Umballa on the\r\n24th May, and reached Kurnal the following morning. On the 26th he was\r\nstruck down by cholera, and in a few hours succumbed to that fatal\r\ndisease. His last words expressed a hope that his country would do him\r\njustice, and it is grievous to feel that, in estimating his work and\r\nthe difficulties he had to encounter, full justice has not been done\r\nhim. Anson has been undeservedly blamed for vacillation and want of\r\npromptitude. He was told to 'make short work of Delhi,' but before\r\nDelhi could be taken more men had perished than his whole force at\r\nthat time amounted to. The advice to march upon Delhi was sound, but\r\nhad it been rashly followed disaster would have been the inevitable\r\nresult. Had the Commander-in-Chief been goaded into advancing without\r\nspare ammunition and siege Artillery, or with an insufficient force,\r\nhe must have been annihilated by the overwhelming masses of the\r\nmutineers--those mutineers, who, we shall see later, stoutly opposed\r\nBarnard's greatly augmented force at Badli-ki-Serai, would almost\r\ncertainly have repulsed, if not destroyed, a smaller body of troops.\r\n\r\nOn the death of General Anson the command of the Field Force devolved\r\non Major-General Sir Henry Barnard.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 'I am not so much surprised,' wrote General Anson to Lord\r\nCanning on the 23rd March, 'at their objections to the cartridges,\r\nhaving seen them. I had no idea they contained, or, rather, are\r\nsmeared with, such a quantity of grease, which looks exactly like fat.\r\nAfter ramming down the ball, the muzzle of the musket is covered\r\nwith it. This, however, will, I imagine, not be the case with those\r\nprepared according to the late instructions. But there are now\r\nmisgivings about the paper, and I think it so desirable that they\r\nshould be assured that no animal grease is used in its manufacture,\r\nthat I have ordered a special report to be made to me on that head\r\nfrom Meerut, and until I receive an answer, and am satisfied that no\r\nobjectionable material is used, no firing at the depots by the sepoys\r\nwill take place. It would be easy to dismiss the detachments to their\r\nregiments without any practice, on the ground that the hot weather is\r\nso advanced, and that very little progress could be made, but I do not\r\nthink that would be admissible. The question, having been raised, must\r\nbe settled. It would only be deferred till another year, and I trust\r\nthat the measures taken by the Government when the objection was first\r\nmade, and the example of the punishment of the 19th Native Infantry\r\nand of the other delinquents of the 70th, now being tried by a General\r\nCourt-Martial, will have the effect we desire.'--KAYE, vol. i., p.\r\n558.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Surely those whom God has a mind to destroy, He first\r\ndeprives of their senses; for not only were the magazines at Delhi and\r\nCawnpore allowed to fall into the enemy's hands, but the great arsenal\r\nat Allahabad narrowly escaped the same fate. Up till May, 1857, this\r\nfort was garrisoned only by Native soldiers. Early in that month sixty\r\nworn-out European pensioners were brought to Allahabad from Chunar,\r\nwith whose assistance, and that of a few hastily raised Volunteers,\r\nLieutenants Russell and Tod Brown, of the Bengal Artillery, were able\r\nto overawe and disarm the Native guard on the very night on which the\r\nregiments to which they belonged mutinied in the adjoining cantonment.\r\nThese two gallant officers had taken the precaution to fill the\r\ncellars below the armoury (which contained some 50,000 or 60,000\r\nstands of arms) with barrels of powder, their intention being to blow\r\nup the whole place in the event of the sepoys getting the upper hand.\r\nThis determination was known to all in the fort, and no doubt had\r\nsomething to say to the guard submitting to be disarmed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: He has been accused of dilatoriness and want of decision\r\nafter hearing the news.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Places at the foot of the Himalayas.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Now the Marquis of Tweeddale.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: A small hill state near Simla.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: It is a remarkable fact that the five senior officers at\r\nthis conference were all dead in less than seven weeks.

One of Sir John Lawrence's first acts after\r\ntalking over matters with Chamberlain was to summon Edwardes from\r\nPeshawar, for he wished to consult with him personally about the\r\nquestion of raising levies and enlisting more frontier men, the only\r\none of Edwardes's and Nicholson's proposals regarding which the Chief\r\nCommissioner had any doubt; it appeared to him a somewhat risky step\r\nto take, and he desired to give the matter very careful consideration\r\nbefore coming to any decision. I remember being greatly struck with\r\nthe weight given by Lawrence to Edwardes's opinion. He called him his\r\nCouncillor, he eagerly sought his advice, and he evidently placed the\r\nutmost reliance on his judgment.\r\n\r\nDuring the six days that we remained at Rawal Pindi waiting for the\r\nMovable Column to be assembled, I spent the greater part of my time\r\nin the Chief Commissioner's office, drafting or copying confidential\r\nletters and telegrams. I thus learned everything that was happening in\r\nthe Punjab, and became aware of the magnitude of the crisis through\r\nwhich we were passing. This enabled me to appreciate the tremendous\r\nefforts required to cope with the danger, and to understand that the\r\nfate of Delhi and the lives of our countrymen and countrywomen in\r\nUpper India depended upon the action taken by the authorities in the\r\nPunjab. I realized that Sir John Lawrence thought of every detail, and\r\nhow correct was his judgment as to which of his subordinates could, or\r\ncould not, be trusted. The many European women and children scattered\r\nover the province caused him the greatest anxiety, and he wisely\r\ndetermined to collect them as much as possible at hill stations and\r\nthe larger centres, where they would be under the protection of\r\nBritish troops; for this reason he ordered the families of the\r\nEuropean soldiers at Sialkot (who were being withdrawn to join the\r\nMovable Column) to be sent to Lahore. But, notwithstanding all that\r\nhad occurred, and was daily occurring, to demonstrate how universal\r\nwas the spirit of disaffection throughout the Native Army, Brigadier\r\nFrederick Brind, who commanded at Sialkot, could not be brought to\r\nbelieve that the regiments serving under his command would ever prove\r\ndisloyal, and he strongly objected to carry out an order which he\r\ndenounced as 'showing a want of confidence in the sepoys.' John\r\nLawrence, however, stood firm. Brind was ordered to despatch the\r\nsoldiers' families without delay, and advised to urge the civilians\r\nand military officers to send away their families at the same time. A\r\nfew of the ladies and children were sent off, but some were allowed to\r\nremain until the troops mutinied, when the Brigadier was one of the\r\nfirst to pay the penalty of his misplaced confidence, being shot down\r\nby one of his own orderlies.\r\n\r\nWe had not been long at Rawal Pindi before we heard that the\r\nuneasiness at Peshawar was hourly increasing, and that the detachment\r\nof the 55th Native Infantry[1] at Nowshera had mutinied and broken\r\nopen the magazine. The military force in the Peshawar valley had been\r\nconsiderably weakened by the withdrawal of the 27th Foot and Corps of\r\nGuides; it was evident that disaffection was rapidly spreading, and\r\nwhat was still more alarming was the ominously restless feelings\r\namongst the principal tribes on the frontier. Nicholson encountered\r\nconsiderable difficulty in raising local levies, and there was a\r\ngeneral unwillingness to enlist. Our disasters in Kabul in 1841-42\r\nhad not been forgotten; our cause was considered desperate, and even\r\nNicholson could not persuade men to join it. It was clear that this\r\nstate of affairs must not be allowed to continue, and that some\r\ndecisive measures must quickly be taken, or there would be a general\r\nrising along the frontier.\r\n\r\nMatters seemed to be drawing to a head, when it was wisely determined\r\nto disarm the Native regiments at Peshawar without delay. This\r\nconclusion was come to at midnight on the 21st May, when the news of\r\nthe unfortunate occurrences at Nowshera reached Edwardes, who had\r\nreturned that morning from Rawal Pindi. He and Nicholson felt that\r\nno time was to be lost, for if the sepoys heard that the regiment at\r\nNowshera had mutinied, it would be too late to attempt to disarm them.\r\nGoing forthwith to the Brigadier's house, they communicated their\r\nviews to Sydney Cotton, who thoroughly appreciated the urgency of the\r\ncase, and, acting with the most praiseworthy decision, summoned the\r\ncommanding officers of all the Native regiments to be at his house at\r\ndaybreak.\r\n\r\nWhen they were assembled, the Brigadier carefully explained to\r\nthe officers how matters stood. He pointed out to them that their\r\nregiments were known to be on the verge of mutiny, and that they must\r\nbe disarmed forthwith, ending by expressing his great regret at having\r\nto take so serious a step.\r\n\r\nThe officers were quite aghast. They were persistent and almost\r\ninsubordinate in expressing their conviction that the measure was\r\nwholly uncalled-for, that the sepoys were thoroughly loyal, and that,\r\nnotwithstanding what had occurred in other places, they had perfect\r\nconfidence in their men.\r\n\r\nThe Brigadier, who knew the officers well, felt that every allowance\r\nshould be made for them, called upon as they were to disarm the men\r\nwith whom they had been so long associated, and in whom they\r\nstill implicitly believed. But although he regarded the officers'\r\nremonstrances as natural and excusable, Cotton never wavered in his\r\ndecision, for he was experienced enough to see that the evil was\r\nwidespread and deep-seated, and that any display of confidence or\r\nattempt at conciliation in dealing with the disaffected regiments\r\nwould be worse than useless.\r\n\r\nThe parade, which was ordered for 7 a.m., was conducted with great\r\njudgment. The European troops were skilfully disposed so as to render\r\nresistance useless, and four out of the five regular Native regiments\r\nwere called upon to lay down their arms. The fifth regiment--the 21st\r\nNative Infantry[2]--was exempted from this indignity, partly because\r\nit had shown no active symptoms of disaffection, was well commanded\r\nand had good officers, and partly because it would have been extremely\r\ndifficult to carry on the military duties of the station without some\r\nNative Infantry.\r\n\r\nThe two regiments of Irregular Cavalry were also spared the disgrace\r\nof being disarmed. It was hoped that the stake the Native officers\r\nand men had in the service (their horses and arms being their own\r\nproperty) would prevent them from taking an active part in the Mutiny,\r\nand it was believed that the British officers who served with them,\r\nand who for the most part were carefully selected, had sufficient\r\ninfluence over their men to keep them straight. This hope proved to be\r\nnot altogether without foundation, for of the eighteen regiments of\r\nIrregular Cavalry which existed in May, 1857, eight are still borne on\r\nthe strength of the Bengal Army; while of the ten regiments of Regular\r\nCavalry and seventy-four of Infantry, none of the former, and only\r\neleven of the latter, now remain.\r\n\r\nHow immediate and salutary were the effects of the disarmament on\r\nthe inhabitants of the Peshawar valley will be seen by the following\r\naccount which Edwardes gave of it. 'As we rode down to the disarming a\r\nvery few Chiefs and yeomen of the country attended us; and I remember\r\njudging from their faces that they came to see which way the tide\r\nwould turn. As we rode back friends were as thick as summer flies, and\r\nlevies began from that moment to come in.'\r\n\r\nThe Subadar-Major of the 51st--one of the four regiments disarmed--had\r\na few days before written to the men of the 64th, who were divided\r\namongst the outposts, calling upon them to return to Peshawar in time\r\nto join in the revolt fixed for the 22nd May. The letter ran; 'In\r\nwhatever way you can manage it, come into Peshawar on the 21st\r\ninstant. Thoroughly understand that point! In fact, eat there and\r\ndrink here.' The rapidity with which the disarmament had been carried\r\nthrough spoilt the Subadar-Major's little game; he had, however, gone\r\ntoo far to draw back, and on the night of the 22nd he deserted, taking\r\nwith him 250 men of the regiment. His hopes were a second time doomed\r\nto disappointment. However welcome 250 muskets might have been to the\r\nAfridis, 250 unarmed sepoys were no prize; and as our neighbours in\r\nthe hills had evidently come to the conclusion that our _raj_ was not\r\nin such a desperate state as they had imagined, and that their best\r\npolicy was to side with us, they caught the deserters, with the\r\nassistance of the district police, and made them over to the\r\nauthorities. The men were all tried by Court-Martial, and the\r\nSubadar-Major was hanged in the presence of the whole garrison.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd May, the day after the disarmament, news was received at\r\nPeshawar that the 55th Native Infantry had mutinied at Mardan, and\r\nthat the 10th Irregular Cavalry, which was divided between Nowshera\r\nand Mardan, had turned against us. A force was at once despatched to\r\nrestore order, and Nicholson accompanied it as political officer. No\r\nsooner did the mutineers, on the morning of the 25th, catch sight\r\nof the approaching column than they broke out of the fort and fled\r\ntowards the Swat hills. Nicholson pursued with his levies and mounted\r\npolice, and before night 120 fugitives were killed and as many more\r\nmade prisoners. The remainder found no welcome among the hill tribes,\r\nand eventually became wanderers over the country until they died or\r\nwere killed. Poor Spottiswoode, the Colonel, committed suicide shortly\r\nbefore the Peshawar troops reached Mardan.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Head-Quarters of this regiment had been sent to\r\nMardan in place of the Guides.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Now the 1st Bengal Infantry.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n1857\r\n\r\n  Neville Chamberlain's presence of mind\r\n  --The command of the Column--Robert Montgomery\r\n  --Disarmament at Mian Mir\r\n  --A Drum-Head Court-Martial--Swift retribution\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile I was employed in the Chief Commissioner's office at Rawal Pindi\r\nit became known that the Mutineers intended to make their stand at\r\nDelhi, and immediately urgent demands came from the Head-Quarters of\r\nthe army for troops to be sent from the Punjab. Sir John Lawrence\r\nexerted himself to the uttermost, even to the extent of denuding his\r\nown province to a somewhat dangerous degree, and the Guides and 1st\r\nPunjab Infantry, which had been told off for the Movable Column, were\r\nordered instead to proceed to Delhi.\r\n\r\nThe Guides, a corps second to none in Her Majesty's Indian Army, was\r\ncommanded by Captain Daly,[1] and consisted of three troops of Cavalry\r\nand six companies of Infantry. The regiment had got as far as Attock,\r\nwhen it received the order to proceed to Delhi, and pushed on at once\r\nby double marches. The 4th Sikhs, under Captain Rothney, and the 1st\r\nPunjab Infantry, under Major Coke,[2] followed in quick succession,\r\nand later on the following troops belonging to the Punjab Frontier\r\nForce were despatched towards Delhi: a squadron of the 1st Punjab\r\nCavalry, under Lieutenant John Watson (my companion in Kashmir);\r\na squadron of the 2nd Punjab Cavalry, under Lieutenant Charles\r\nNicholson[3] (John Nicholson's brother); a squadron of the 5th Punjab\r\nCavalry, under Lieutenant Younghusband; and the 2nd and 4th Punjab\r\nInfantry, commanded respectively by Captains G. Green[4] and A.\r\nWilde.[5]\r\n\r\nWe (Brigadier Chamberlain and I) remained at Rawal Pindi until the\r\n24th May to give our servants and horses time to reach Wazirabad, and\r\nthen started on a mail-cart for the latter place, which we reached\r\non the 27th. Lieutenant James Walker,[6] of the Bombay Engineers,\r\naccompanied us as the Brigadier's orderly officer.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Trunk Road, which runs in a direct line from Calcutta to\r\nPeshawar, was then in course of construction through the Punjab, and\r\nin places was in rather an elementary condition. The drivers of the\r\nmail-carts sent along their half-wild and entirely unbroken ponies at\r\nracing speed, regardless alike of obstacles and consequences. With an\r\nenterprising coachman the usual pace was about twelve miles an\r\nhour, including stoppages. As we were recklessly flying along, the\r\nBrigadier, who was sitting in front, perceived that one of the reins\r\nhad become unbuckled, and warned Walker and me to look out for an\r\nupset. Had the coachman not discovered the state of his tackle all\r\nmight have been well, for the ponies needed no guiding along the\r\nwell-known road. Unfortunately, however, he became aware of what had\r\nhappened, lost his head, and pulled the reins; the animals dashed off\r\nthe road, there was a crash, and we found ourselves on the ground,\r\nscattered in different directions. No great damage was done, and in a\r\nfew minutes we had righted the cart, re-harnessed the ponies, and were\r\nrushing along as before.\r\n\r\nIn order that the authorities at Rawal Pindi might be able to\r\ncommunicate with the Movable Column while on the march and away\r\nfrom telegraph stations, which were few and far between in 1857, a\r\nsignaller accompanied us, and travelled with his instruments on a\r\nsecond mail-cart, and wherever we halted for the day he attached his\r\nwire to the main line. He had just completed the attachment on our\r\narrival at Wazirabad, when I observed that the instrument was working,\r\nand on drawing the signaller's attention to it, he read off a message\r\nwhich was at that moment being transmitted to the Chief Commissioner,\r\ninforming him of the death of the Commander-in-Chief at Kurnal the\r\nprevious day. This sad news did not directly affect the Movable\r\nColumn, as it had been organized by, and was under the orders of, the\r\nPunjab Government, which for the time being had become responsible for\r\nthe military, as well as the civil, administration in the north of\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nThe column had marched into Wazirabad the day before we arrived.\r\nIt consisted of Major Dawes' troop of European Horse Artillery,\r\na European battery of Field Artillery, commanded by Captain\r\nBourchier,[7] and Her Majesty's 52nd Light Infantry, commanded by\r\nColonel George Campbell. In addition, and with a view to reducing the\r\nNative garrison of Sialkot, a wing of the 9th Bengal Light Cavalry and\r\nthe 35th Native Infantry were attached to the column.\r\n\r\nMy first duty at Wazirabad was to call upon the senior officer,\r\nColonel Campbell, and inform him that Brigadier Chamberlain had come\r\nto take over command of the Movable Column. I found the Colonel lying\r\non his bed trying to make himself as comfortable as it was possible\r\nwith the thermometer at 117° Fahrenheit. We had not met before, and he\r\ncertainly received me in a very off-hand manner. He never moved from\r\nhis recumbent position, and on my delivering my message, he told me he\r\nwas not aware that the title of Brigadier carried military rank\r\nwith it; that he understood Brigadier Chamberlain was only a\r\nLieutenant-Colonel, whereas he held the rank of Colonel in Her\r\nMajesty's army; and that, under these circumstances, he must decline\r\nto acknowledge Brigadier Chamberlain as his senior officer. I replied\r\nthat I would give his message to the Brigadier, and took my leave.\r\n\r\nWhen Chamberlain heard what had occurred, he desired me to return to\r\nCampbell and explain that he had no wish to dispute the question of\r\nrelative seniority, and that in assuming command of the column he\r\nwas only carrying out the orders of the Commander-in-Chief in India.\r\nCampbell, who technically speaking had the right on his side, was\r\nnot to be appeased, and requested me to inform the Brigadier of his\r\ndetermination not to serve under an officer whom he considered to be\r\nhis junior.\r\n\r\nThis was not a pleasant beginning to our duties with the column, and\r\nChamberlain thought that we had better take our departure and leave\r\nCampbell in command until the question could be settled by superior\r\nauthority. Campbell was accordingly asked to march the troops to\r\nLahore, to which place we continued our journey by mail-cart.\r\n\r\nAt the same time a reference was made to Sir John Lawrence and\r\nGeneral Reed, which resulted in the decision that, under the peculiar\r\ncircumstances of the case, it was essential that an officer of Indian\r\nexperience should be in command of the column, and that Campbell,\r\nhaving only been a very short time in the country, did not fulfil this\r\ncondition; but Campbell was told that, if he objected to serve under\r\nChamberlain, he could remain at Lahore with the Head-Quarters of his\r\nregiment. Campbell, who at heart was really a very nice fellow and an\r\nexcellent officer, would not be separated from the 52nd, and agreed\r\nto serve under the Brigadier, reserving to himself the right of\r\nprotesting when the new Commander-in-Chief should arrive in India.\r\n\r\nThere was probably another reason for Campbell not wishing to serve\r\nunder Chamberlain besides that of being senior to him in the army, in\r\nthe fact that the Brigadier was a servant of 'John Company,' while\r\nCampbell belonged to the 'Queen's Service.' From the time of the\r\nestablishment of a local army there had existed an absurd and\r\nunfortunate jealousy between the officers of the Queen's and Company's\r\nservices, and one of the best results of the Mutiny was its gradual\r\ndisappearance. This ill-feeling influenced not only fellow-countrymen,\r\nbut relations, even brothers, if they belonged to the different\r\nservices, and was distinctly prejudicial to the interests of the\r\nGovernment. It is difficult to understand how so puerile a sentiment\r\ncould have been so long indulged in by officers who no doubt\r\nconsidered themselves sensible Englishmen.[8]\r\n\r\nOn the 31st May we arrived at Lahore, where we found everyone in a\r\nstate of considerable excitement. Lahore was and is the great centre\r\nof the Punjab, and to it non-combatants and English ladies with their\r\nchildren were hurrying from all the outlying districts. In the city\r\nitself there was a mixed population of nearly 100,000, chiefly Sikhs\r\nand Mahomedans, many of the former old soldiers who had served in the\r\nKhalsa Army. The fort, which was within the walls of the city, was\r\ngarrisoned by half a regiment of sepoys, one company of European\r\nInfantry, and a few European Artillerymen. Mian Mir, five miles\r\noff, was the Head-Quarters of the Lahore division; it was a long,\r\nstraggling cantonment, laid out for a much larger force than it has\r\never been found necessary to place there, with the European Infantry\r\nat one end and the European Artillery at the other, separated by\r\nNative troops. This arrangement (which existed in almost every station\r\nin India) is another proof of the implicit confidence placed in the\r\nNative army--a confidence in mercenary soldiers of alien races which\r\nseems all the more surprising when we call to mind the warnings\r\nthat for nearly a hundred years had been repeatedly given of the\r\npossibility of disaffection existing amongst Native troops.\r\n\r\nThere were four Native regiments at Mian Mir, one of Cavalry and three\r\nof Infantry, while the European portion of the garrison consisted of\r\none weak Infantry regiment, two troops of Horse Artillery, and four\r\ncompanies of Foot Artillery. This force was commanded by Brigadier\r\nCorbett, of the Bengal Army; he had been nearly forty years in the\r\nservice, was mentally and physically vigorous, and had no fear of\r\nresponsibility. Robert Montgomery[9] was then chief civil officer at\r\nLahore. He was of a most gentle and benevolent nature, with a rubicund\r\ncountenance and a short, somewhat portly figure, which characteristics\r\nled to his being irreverently called 'Pickwick,' and probably if he\r\nhad lived in less momentous times he would never have been credited\r\nwith the great qualities which the crisis in the Punjab proved him to\r\npossess.\r\n\r\nOn receipt of the telegraphic news of the outbreaks at Meerut and\r\nDelhi, Montgomery felt that immediate action was necessary. He at once\r\nset to work to discover the temper of the Native troops at Mian Mir,\r\nand soon ascertained that they were disaffected to the core, and were\r\nonly waiting to hear from their friends in the south to break into\r\nopen mutiny. He thoroughly understood the Native character, and\r\nrealized the danger to the whole province of there being anything in\r\nthe shape of a serious disturbance at its capital; so after consulting\r\nhis various officials, Montgomery decided to suggest to the Brigadier\r\nthe advisability of disarming the sepoys, or, if that were considered\r\ntoo strong a measure, of taking their ammunition from them. Corbett\r\nmet him quite half-way; he also saw that the danger was imminent, and\r\nthat prompt action was necessary, but he not unnaturally shrank from\r\ntaking the extreme step of disarming men whose loyalty had never until\r\nthen been doubted--a step, moreover, which he knew would be keenly\r\nresented by all the regimental officers--he therefore at first only\r\nagreed to deprive the sepoys of their ammunition; later in the day,\r\nhowever, after thinking the matter over, he came to the conclusion\r\nthat it would be better to adopt Montgomery's bolder proposal, and he\r\ninformed him accordingly that he would 'go the whole hog.'\r\n\r\nI do not think that Corbett's action on this occasion has been\r\nsufficiently appreciated. That he decided rightly there can be no\r\ndoubt, but very few officers holding commands in India at that time\r\nwould have accepted such responsibility. His knowledge as to what had\r\nhappened at Meerut and Delhi was based on one or two meagre telegrams,\r\nand the information Montgomery gave him as to the treacherous\r\nintentions of the sepoys at Mian Mir had been obtained by means of\r\na spy, who, it was quite possible, might have been actuated by\r\ninterested motives.\r\n\r\nHaving made up his mind what should be done, Corbett had the good\r\nsense to understand that success depended on its being done quickly,\r\nand on the Native troops being kept absolutely in the dark as to what\r\nwas about to take place. A general parade was ordered for the next\r\nmorning, the 13th May, and it was wisely determined not to put off a\r\nball which was being given that evening to the officers of the 81st\r\nFoot. The secret was confided to very few, and the great majority of\r\nthose who were taking part in the entertainment were ignorant of the\r\nreason for a parade having been ordered the following morning--an\r\nunusual proceeding which caused a certain amount of grumbling.\r\n\r\nWhen the sepoys were drawn up, it was explained to them in their own\r\nlanguage that they were about to be deprived of their arms, in order\r\nto put temptation out of their reach, and save them from the disgrace\r\nof being led away by the evil example of other corps. Whilst they were\r\nbeing thus addressed, the Horse Artillery and 81st Foot took up a\r\nsecond line immediately in rear of the Native regiments, the guns\r\nbeing quietly loaded with grape during the manoeuvre. The regiments\r\nwere then directed to change front to the rear, when they found\r\nthemselves face to face with the British troops. The order was given\r\nto the sepoys to 'pile arms'; one of the regiments hesitated, but only\r\nfor a moment; resistance was hopeless, and the word of command was\r\nsullenly obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe same morning the fort of Lahore was secured. Three companies of\r\nthe 81st marched into it at daylight, relieved the sepoys of their\r\nguards, and ordered them to lay down their arms. Another company\r\nof the same regiment travelled through the night in carriages to\r\nUmritsar, the holy city of the Sikhs, and occupied the fortress\r\nof Govindgarh. Montgomery had been very anxious about these two\r\nstrongholds, and it was a great satisfaction to him to know that they\r\nwere at length safely guarded by British bayonets.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as I have said, we found Lahore in a state of considerable\r\nexcitement, it was satisfactory to see how fully the situation had\r\nbeen grasped, and how everything that was possible had been done\r\nto maintain order, and show the people of the Punjab that we were\r\nprepared to hold our own. Montgomery's foresight and decision, and\r\nCorbett's hearty and willing co-operation, checked, if not altogether\r\nstopped, what, under less energetic management, would assuredly have\r\nresulted in very grievous trouble. Excitement was inevitable. There\r\nwas a general stir throughout the province. Lahore was crowded with\r\nthe families of European soldiers, and with ladies who had come there\r\nfrom various parts of the Punjab, all in terrible anxiety as to what\r\nmight be the ultimate fate of their husbands and relatives; some of\r\nwhom were with Native regiments, whose loyalty was more than doubtful;\r\nsome with the Movable Column, the destination of which was uncertain;\r\nwhile others were already on their way to join the army hurrying to\r\nDelhi.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty with Campbell having been settled, Chamberlain assumed\r\nthe command of the Movable Column, the advent of which on the 2nd June\r\nwas hailed with delight by all the Europeans at Lahore. A regiment of\r\nBritish Infantry and two batteries of Artillery afforded a much needed\r\nsupport to the handful of British soldiers keeping guard over the\r\ngreat capital of the Punjab, and gave confidence to the Sikhs and\r\nothers disposed to be loyal, but who were doubtful as to the wisdom of\r\nsiding with us.\r\n\r\nThe disturbing element was the Native troops which accompanied the\r\ncolumn. They had not shown openly that they contemplated mutiny, but\r\nwe knew that they were not to be trusted, and were only watching for\r\nan opportunity to break out and escape to Delhi with their arms.\r\n\r\nI was living with the Brigadier in a house only a few minutes' walk\r\nfrom the garden where the Native regiments were encamped, and the\r\nspies we were employing to watch them had orders to come to me\r\nwhenever anything suspicious should occur. During the night of the\r\n8th June one of these men awoke me with the news that the 35th Native\r\nInfantry intended to revolt at daybreak, and that some of them had\r\nalready loaded their muskets. I awoke the Brigadier, who directed me\r\nto go at once to the British officers of the regiment, tell them what\r\nwe had heard, and that he would be with them shortly. As soon as the\r\nBrigadier arrived the men were ordered to fall in, and on their arms\r\nbeing examined two of them were found to have been loaded. The sepoys\r\nto whom the muskets belonged were made prisoners, and I was ordered to\r\nsee them lodged in the police-station.\r\n\r\nChamberlain determined to lose no time in dealing with the case, and\r\nalthough Drum-Head Courts-Martial were then supposed to be obsolete,\r\nhe decided to revive, for this occasion, that very useful means of\r\ndisposing, in time of war, of grave cases of crime.\r\n\r\nThe Brigadier thought it desirable that the Court-Martial should be\r\ncomposed of Native, rather than British, officers, as being likely to\r\nbe looked upon by the prisoners as a more impartial tribunal, under\r\nthe peculiar circumstances in which we were placed. This was made\r\npossible by the arrival of the 1st Punjab Infantry--Coke's Rifles--a\r\ngrand regiment under a grand Commander. Raised in 1849, composed\r\nchiefly of Sikhs and Pathans, and possessing Native officers of\r\nundoubted loyalty, the 1st Punjab Infantry had taken part in almost\r\nevery frontier expedition during the previous eight years. Its history\r\nwas a glorious record of faithful and devoted service, such as can\r\nonly be rendered by brave men led by officers in whom they believe and\r\ntrust.[10] The Subadar-Major of the corps was a man called Mir Jaffir,\r\na most gallant Afghan soldier, who entered the British service during\r\nthe first Afghan war, and distinguished himself greatly in all the\r\nsubsequent frontier fights. This Native officer was made president\r\nof the Court-Martial. The prisoners were found guilty of mutiny, and\r\nsentenced to death. Chamberlain decided that they should be blown away\r\nfrom guns, in the presence of their own comrades, as being the most\r\nawe-inspiring means of carrying the sentence into effect.[11] A parade\r\nwas at once ordered. The troops were drawn up so as to form three\r\nsides of a square; on the fourth side were two guns. As the prisoners\r\nwere being brought to the parade, one of them asked me if they were\r\ngoing to be blown from guns. I said, 'Yes.' He made no further remark,\r\nand they both walked steadily on until they reached the guns, to which\r\nthey were bound, when one of them requested that some rupees he had on\r\nhis person might be saved for his relations. The Brigadier answered:\r\n'It is too late!' The word of command was given; the guns went off\r\nsimultaneously, and the two mutineers were launched into eternity.\r\n\r\nIt was a terrible sight, and one likely to haunt the beholder for many\r\na long day; but that was what was intended. I carefully watched\r\nthe sepoys' faces to see how it affected them. They were evidently\r\nstartled at the swift retribution which had overtaken their guilty\r\ncomrades, but looked more crest-fallen than shocked or horrified, and\r\nwe soon learnt that their determination to mutiny, and make the best\r\nof their way to Delhi, was in nowise changed by the scene they had\r\nwitnessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The late General Sir Henry Daly, G.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Now General Sir John Coke, G.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Afterwards commanded by Lieutenant, now General, Sir\r\nDighton Probyn, V.C., G.C.V.O., K.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The late Major-General Sir George Green, K.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The late Lieutenant-General Sir Alfred Wilde, K.C.B.,\r\nK.C.S.I.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The late General James Walker, C.B., sometime\r\nSurveyor-General in India.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Now General Sir George Bourchier, K.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Now, except for one short interval, every officer who has\r\njoined the Indian Army since 1861 must, in the first instance, have\r\nbelonged or been attached to one of Her Majesty's British regiments:\r\nthe great majority have been educated at Sandhurst or Woolwich, and\r\nall feel that they are members of the same army.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: The late Sir Robert Montgomery, G.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: During the operations in the Kohat Pass in February,\r\n1850, within twelve months of the corps being raised, several of the\r\nmen were killed and wounded.

I leave her to your care.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Awe-inspiring certainly, but probably the most humane,\r\nas being a sure and instantaneous mode of execution.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n1857\r\n\r\n  Ferozepore--Crawford Chamberlain at Multan\r\n  --Chamberlain's masterly conduct\r\n  --Nicholson succeeds Neville Chamberlain--Irresolution at Jullundur\r\n  --General Mehtab Sing--Nicholson's soldierly instincts\r\n  --More disarmaments\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a few days after our arrival at Lahore nothing could be settled as\r\nto the further movements of the column. It was wanted in all parts of\r\nthe Punjab: Ferozeporo, Multan, Jhelum, Sialkot, Umritsar, Jullundur,\r\nPhilour, Ludhiana--all these places were more or less disturbed, and\r\nall were clamorous for help.\r\n\r\nAt Ferozepore the Native regiments[1] broke out on the 13th May, when\r\nthey made a daring, but unsuccessful effort to seize the arsenal,\r\nsituated inside the fort and the largest in Upper India. Had that\r\nfallen into the hands of the rebels, Delhi could not have been\r\ncaptured without very considerable delay, for the besieging force\r\ndepended mainly upon Ferozepore for the supply of munitions of war.\r\nThe fort had been allowed to fall into bad repair, and the mutineers\r\nhad no difficulty in forcing their way inside; there, fortunately,\r\nthey were checked by the wall which surrounded the arsenal, and this\r\nobstacle, insignificant as it was, enabled the guard to hold its own.\r\nOriginally this guard consisted entirely of Native soldiers, but, as\r\nI have already recorded, after the outbreak at Meerut, Europeans\r\nhad been told off for the charge of this important post; so strong,\r\nhowever, here as elsewhere, was the belief in the loyalty of the\r\nsepoys, and so great was the reluctance to do anything which might\r\nhurt their feelings, that the Native guard was not withdrawn. This\r\nsame guard, when the attack took place, did its best to assist the\r\nassailants, and even prepared scaling-ladders to enable the latter to\r\ngain access to the magazine enclosure. The Europeans, however,\r\nwere equal to the emergency; they overpowered and disarmed their\r\ntreacherous companions, and then succeeded in beating off and\r\ndispersing the attacking party.\r\n\r\nBeing foiled in this attempt, the mutineers returned to the\r\ncantonment, set fire to the church and other buildings, and then\r\nstarted for Delhi. Ferozepore had a large European garrison, a\r\nregiment of Infantry, a battery of Field Artillery, and a company of\r\nFoot Artillery, and was supposed to be able to look after itself,\r\nalthough affairs had been greatly mismanaged.\r\n\r\nMultan had next to be considered. Matters at that station were very\r\nunsettled, and indeed were causing the authorities grave anxiety, but\r\nMultan was more fortunate than many places, in being in the hands of\r\nan unusually able, experienced officer, Major Crawford Chamberlain.\r\nConsequently, the Commander-in-Chief and Chief Commissioner agreed,\r\nwhile fully appreciating the great value of Multan, that the presence\r\nof British troops was less urgently needed there than elsewhere,\r\nand it was decided they could not be spared from the Punjab for its\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nThe garrison at Multan consisted of a troop of Native Horse Artillery,\r\ntwo regiments of Native Infantry, and the 1st Irregular Cavalry,\r\ncomposed entirely of Hindustanis from the neighbourhood of Delhi;\r\nwhile in the old Sikh fort there were about fifty European\r\nArtillerymen, in charge of a small magazine. The station was nominally\r\ncommanded by an officer who had been thirty-four years in the army,\r\nand had great experience amongst Natives; but he had fallen into such\r\na bad state of health, that he was quite unfit to deal with the\r\ncrisis which had now arrived. The command, therefore, was practically\r\nexercised by Chamberlain. Next to Delhi and Lahore, Multan was the\r\nmost important place in Upper India, as our communication with the sea\r\nand southern India depended on its preservation.\r\n\r\nTo Chamberlain's own personality and extraordinary influence over the\r\nmen of the 1st Irregular Cavalry must be attributed his success. His\r\nrelations with them were of a patriarchal nature, and perfect mutual\r\nconfidence existed. He knew his hold over them was strong, and\r\nhe determined to trust them. But in doing so he had really no\r\nalternative--had they not remained faithful, Multan must have been\r\nlost to us. One of his first acts was to call a meeting at his house\r\nof the Native officers of the Artillery, Infantry, and his own\r\nregiment, to discuss the situation. Taking for granted the absolute\r\nloyalty of these officers, he suggested that a written bond should\r\nbe given, in which the seniors of each corps should guarantee the\r\nfidelity of their men. The officers of his regiment rose _en\r\nmasse_, and placing their signet-rings on the table, said: '_Kabúl\r\nsir-o-chasm'_ ('Agreed to on our lives'). The Artillery Subadar\r\ndeclared that his men had no scruples, and would fire in whichever\r\ndirection they were required; while the Infantry Native officers\r\npleaded that they had no power over their men, and could give no\r\nguarantee. Thus, Chamberlain ascertained that the Cavalry were loyal,\r\nthe Artillery doubtful, and the Infantry were only biding their time\r\nto mutiny.\r\n\r\nNight after night sepoys, disguised beyond all recognition, attempted\r\nto tamper with the Irregular Cavalry. The Wurdi-Major,[2] a\r\nparticularly fine, handsome _Ranagar_,[3] begged Chamberlain to\r\nhide himself in his house, that he might hear for himself the open\r\nproposals to mutiny, massacre, and rebellion that were made to him;\r\nand the promises that, if they succeeded in their designs, he (the\r\nWurdi-Major) should be placed upon the _gaddi_[4] of Multan for his\r\nreward. Chamberlain declined to put himself in such a position,\r\nfearing he might not be able to restrain himself.\r\n\r\nMatters now came to a climax. A Mahomedan Subadar of one of the Native\r\nInfantry regiments laid a plot to murder Chamberlain and his family.\r\nThe plot was discovered and frustrated by Chamberlain's own men, but\r\nit became apparent that the only remedy for the fast increasing evil\r\nwas to disarm the two Native Infantry regiments. How was this to be\r\naccomplished with no Europeans save a few gunners anywhere near? Sir\r\nJohn Lawrence was most pressing that the step should be taken at\r\nonce; he knew the danger of delay; at the same time, he thoroughly\r\nappreciated the difficulty of the task which he was urging Chamberlain\r\nto undertake, and he readily responded to the latter's request for a\r\nregiment of Punjab Infantry to be sent to him. The 2nd Punjab Infantry\r\nwas, therefore, despatched from Dera Ghazi Khan, and at the same time\r\nthe 1st Punjab Cavalry arrived from Asni,[5] under Major Hughes,[6]\r\nwho, hearing of Chamberlain's troubles, had marched to Multan without\r\nwaiting for orders from superior authority. The evening of the day on\r\nwhich these troops reached Multan, the British officers of the several\r\nregiments were directed to assemble at the Deputy-Commissioner's\r\nhouse, when Chamberlain told them of the communication he had received\r\nfrom Sir John Lawrence, adding that, having reliable information that\r\nthe Native Infantry were about to mutiny, he had settled to disarm\r\nthem the next morning.\r\n\r\nIt was midnight before the meeting broke up. At 4 a.m. the Horse\r\nArtillery troop and the two Native Infantry regiments were ordered to\r\nmarch as if to an ordinary parade. When they had gone about a quarter\r\nof a mile they were halted, and the Punjab troops moved quietly\r\nbetween them and their lines, thus cutting them off from their spare\r\nammunition; at the same time the European Artillerymen took their\r\nplaces with the guns of the Horse Artillery troop, and a carefully\r\nselected body of Sikhs belonging to the 1st Punjab Cavalry, under\r\nLieutenant John Watson, was told off to advance on the troop and cut\r\ndown the gunners if they refused to assist the Europeans to work the\r\nguns.\r\n\r\nChamberlain then rode up to the Native Infantry regiments, and after\r\nexplaining to them the reason for their being disarmed, he gave the\r\nword of command, 'Pile arms!' Thereupon a sepoy of the 62nd shouted:\r\n'Don't give up your arms; fight for them!' Lieutenant Thomson, the\r\nAdjutant of the regiment, instantly seized him by the throat and threw\r\nhim to the ground. The order was repeated, and, wonderful to relate,\r\nobeyed. The Native Infantry regiments were then marched back to their\r\nlines, while the Punjab troops and Chamberlain's Irregulars remained\r\non the ground until the arms had been carted off to the fort.\r\n\r\nIt was a most critical time, and enough credit has never been given to\r\nChamberlain. Considering the honours which were bestowed on others\r\nwho took more or less conspicuous parts in the Mutiny, he was very\r\ninsufficiently rewarded for this timely act of heroism. Had he not\r\nshown such undaunted courage and coolness, or had there been the\r\nsmallest hesitation, Multan would certainly have gone. Chamberlain\r\nmanaged an extremely difficult business in a most masterly manner.\r\nHis personal influence insured his own regiment continuing loyal\r\nthroughout the Mutiny, and it has now the honour of being the 1st\r\nRegiment of Bengal Cavalry, and the distinction of wearing a different\r\nuniform from every other regiment in the service, being allowed to\r\nretain the bright yellow which the troopers wore when they were first\r\nraised by Colonel James Skinner, and in which they performed such\r\nloyal service.[7]\r\n\r\nAt Jhelum and Sialkot it was decided that, as the Native troops had\r\nbeen considerably reduced in numbers, the danger was not so great as\r\nto require the presence of the Movable Column.\r\n\r\nUmritsar had been made safe for the time, but it was a place the\r\nimportance of which could not be over-estimated, and it was thought\r\nthat keeping a strong column in its vicinity for a few days would\r\nmaterially strengthen our position there. Moreover, Umritsar lay in\r\nthe direct route to Jullundur, where the military authorities had\r\nproved themselves quite unfitted to deal with the emergency. It was\r\ndecided, therefore, that Umritsar should be our objective in the\r\nfirst instance. We marched from Lahore on the 10th June, and reached\r\nUmritsar the following morning.\r\n\r\nNews of a severe fight at Badli-ki-Serai had been received, which\r\nincreased our anxiety to push on to Delhi, for we feared the place\r\nmight be taken before we could get there. But to our mortification it\r\nwas decided that the column could not be spared just then even for\r\nDelhi, as there was still work for it in the Punjab. To add to our\r\ndisappointment, we had to give up our trusted Commander; for a few\r\nhours after our arrival at Umritsar a telegram came to Neville\r\nChamberlain offering him the Adjutant-Generalship of the Army in\r\nsuccession to Colonel Chester, who had been killed at Badli-ki-Serai.\r\nHe accepted the offer, and I made certain I should go with him. My\r\nchagrin, therefore, can easily be understood when he told me that I\r\nmust remain with the column, as it would be unfair to his successor to\r\ntake away the staff officer. We were now all anxiety to learn who\r\nthat successor should be, and it was a satisfaction to hear that John\r\nNicholson was the man.\r\n\r\nChamberlain left for Delhi on the 13th; but Nicholson could not join\r\nfor a few days, and as troops were much needed at Jullundur, it was\r\narranged that the column should move on to that place, under the\r\ntemporary command of Campbell, and there await the arrival of the new\r\nBrigadier.\r\n\r\nOn my going to Campbell for orders, he informed me that he was no\r\nlonger the senior officer with the column, as a Colonel Denniss,\r\njunior to him regimentally, but his senior in army rank, had just\r\nrejoined the 52nd. Accordingly I reported myself to Denniss, who,\r\nthough an officer of many years' service, had never before held a\r\ncommand, not even that of a regiment; and, poor man! was considerably\r\ntaken aback when he heard that he must be in charge of the column for\r\nsome days. He practically left everything to me--a somewhat trying\r\nposition for almost the youngest officer in the force. It was under\r\nthese circumstances I found what an able man Colonel Campbell really\r\nwas. He correctly gauged Denniss's fitness, or rather unfitness, for\r\nthe command, and appreciating the awkwardness of my position, advised\r\nme so wisely that I had no difficulty in carrying on the work.\r\n\r\nWe reached Jullundur on the 20th, Nicholson taking over command the\r\nsame day. He had been given the rank of Brigadier-General, which\r\nremoved all grounds for objection on the part of Campbell, and the two\r\nsoon learnt to appreciate each other, and became fast friends.\r\n\r\nJullundur was in a state of the greatest confusion. The Native troops,\r\nconsisting of a regiment of Light Cavalry and two regiments of Native\r\nInfantry, began to show signs of disaffection soon after the outbreak\r\nat Meerut, and from that time until the 7th June, when they broke into\r\nopen mutiny, incendiary fires were almost of daily occurrence. The\r\nwant of resolution displayed in dealing with the crisis at Jullundur\r\nwas one of the regrettable episodes of the Mutiny. The European\r\ngarrison consisted of Her Majesty's 8th Foot and a troop of Horse\r\nArtillery. The military authorities had almost a whole month's warning\r\nof the mutinous intentions of the Native troops, but though they had\r\nbefore them the example of the prompt and successful measures adopted\r\nat Lahore and Peshawar, they failed to take any steps to prevent the\r\noutbreak.\r\n\r\nThe Brigadier (Johnstone) was on leave at the commencement of the\r\nMutiny, and during his absence the treasure was placed in charge of\r\na European guard, in accordance with instructions from Sir John\r\nLawrence. This measure was reversed as soon as the Brigadier rejoined,\r\nfor fear of showing distrust of the sepoys, and another wise order\r\nof the watchful Chief Commissioner--to disarm the Native troops--was\r\nnever carried out. The Commissioner, Major Edward Lake, one of Henry\r\nLawrence's most capable assistants, had also repeatedly urged upon\r\nJohnstone the advisability of depriving the sepoys of their arms, but\r\nhis advice remained unheeded. When the inevitable revolt took place\r\nEuropean soldiers were allowed to be passive spectators while property\r\nwas being destroyed, and sepoys to disappear in the darkness of the\r\nnight carrying with them their muskets and all the treasure and\r\nplunder they could lay their hands on.\r\n\r\nA futile attempt at pursuit was made the following morning, but, as\r\nwill be seen, this was carried out in so half-hearted a manner, that\r\nthe mutineers were able to get safely across the Sutlej with their\r\nloot, notwithstanding that the passage of this broad river had to be\r\nmade by means of a ferry, where only very few boats were available.\r\nHaving reached Philour, the British troops were ordered to push on to\r\nDelhi, and as Jullundur was thus left without protection, Lake gladly\r\naccepted the offer of the Raja of Kapurthala to garrison it with his\r\nown troops.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt as to the loyalty of the Raja himself, and his\r\nsincere desire to help us; but the mismanagement of affairs at\r\nJullundur had done much to lower our prestige in the eyes of his\r\npeople, and there was no mistaking the offensive demeanour of his\r\ntroops. They evidently thought that British soldiers had gone never\r\nto return, and they swaggered about in swash-buckler fashion, as only\r\nNatives who think they have the upper hand can swagger.\r\n\r\nIt was clearly Lake's policy to keep on good terms with the Kapurthala\r\npeople. His position was much strengthened by the arrival of our\r\ncolumn; but we were birds of passage, and might be off at any moment,\r\nso in order to pay a compliment to the officers and principal men with\r\nthe Kapurthala troops, Lake asked Nicholson to meet them at his house.\r\nNicholson consented, and a durbar was arranged. I was present on the\r\noccasion, and was witness of rather a curious scene, illustrative\r\nalike of Nicholson and Native character.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the ceremony Mehtab Sing, a general officer in the\r\nKapurthala Army, took his leave, and, as the senior in rank at the\r\ndurbar, was walking out of the room first, when I observed Nicholson\r\nstalk to the door, put himself in front of Mehtab Sing and, waving him\r\nback with an authoritative air, prevent him from leaving the room. The\r\nrest of the company then passed out, and when they had gone, Nicholson\r\nsaid to Lake: 'Do you see that General Mehtab Sing has his shoes\r\non?'[8] Lake replied that he had noticed the fact, but tried to excuse\r\nit. Nicholson, however, speaking in Hindustani, said: 'There is no\r\npossible excuse for such an act of gross impertinence. Mehtab Sing\r\nknows perfectly well that he would not venture to step on his own\r\nfather's carpet save barefooted, and he has only committed this breach\r\nof etiquette to-day because he thinks we are not in a position to\r\nresent the insult, and that he can treat us as he would not have\r\ndared to do a month ago.' Mehtab Sing looked extremely foolish, and\r\nstammered some kind of apology; but Nicholson was not to be appeased,\r\nand continued: 'If I were the last Englishman left in Jullundur, you'\r\n(addressing Mehtab Sing) 'should not come into my room with your\r\nshoes on;' then, politely turning to Lake, he added, 'I hope the\r\nCommissioner will now allow me to order you to take your shoes off and\r\ncarry them out in your own hands, so that your followers may witness\r\nyour discomfiture.' Mehtab Sing, completely cowed, meekly did as he\r\nwas told.\r\n\r\nAlthough in the kindness of his heart Lake had at first endeavoured to\r\nsmooth matters over, he knew Natives well, and he readily admitted\r\nthe wisdom of Nicholson's action. Indeed, Nicholson's uncompromising\r\nbearing on this occasion proved a great help to Lake, for it had the\r\nbest possible effect upon the Kapurthala people; their manner at once\r\nchanged, all disrespect vanished, and there was no more swaggering\r\nabout as if they considered themselves masters of the situation.\r\n\r\nFive or six years after this occurrence I was one of a pig-sticking\r\nparty at Kapurthala, given by the Raja in honour of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, Sir Hugh Rose.[9] When riding home in the evening\r\nI found myself close to the elephant on which our host and the Chief\r\nwere sitting. The conversation happening to turn on the events of the\r\nMutiny, I asked what had become of General Mehtab Sing. The Raja,\r\npointing to an elephant a little distance off on which two Native\r\ngentlemen were riding, said, 'There he is.' I recognized the General,\r\nand making him a salaam, which he politely returned, I said to him, 'I\r\nhave not had the pleasure of meeting you since those hot days in June,\r\n1857, when I was at Jullundur.' The Raja then asked me if I knew\r\nNicholson. On my telling him I had been his staff officer, and with\r\nhim at the durbar at Lake _Sahib's_ house, the Raja laughed heartily,\r\nand said, 'Oh! then you saw Mehtab Sing made to walk out of the room\r\nwith his shoes in his hand? We often chaff him about that little\r\naffair, and tell him that he richly deserved the treatment he received\r\nfrom the great Nicholson _Sahib_.'\r\n\r\nSir Hugh Rose was greatly interested in the story, which he made me\r\nrepeat to him as soon as we got back to camp, and he was as much\r\nstruck as I was with this spontaneous testimony of a leading Native to\r\nthe wisdom of Nicholson's procedure.\r\n\r\nOn taking over command, Nicholson's first care was to establish an\r\neffective system of intelligence, by means of which he was kept\r\ninformed of what was going on in the neighbouring districts; and,\r\nfully recognizing the necessity for rapid movement in the event of any\r\nsudden emergency, he organized a part of his force into a small\r\nflying column, the infantry portion of which was to be carried in\r\n_ekkas_.[10] I was greatly impressed by Nicholson's knowledge of\r\nmilitary affairs. He seemed always to know exactly what to do and the\r\nbest way to do it. This was the more remarkable because, though\r\na soldier by profession, his training had been chiefly that of a\r\ncivilian--a civilian of the frontier, however, where his soldierly\r\ninstincts had been fostered in his dealing with a lawless and unruly\r\npeople, and where he had received a training which was now to stand\r\nhim in good stead. Nicholson was a born Commander, and this was felt\r\nby every officer and man with the column before he had been amongst\r\nthem many days.\r\n\r\nThe Native troops with the column had given no trouble since we left\r\nLahore. We were travelling in the direction they desired to go, which\r\naccounted for their remaining quiet; but Nicholson, realizing the\r\ndanger of having them in our midst, and the probability of their\r\nrefusing to turn away from Delhi in the event of our having to retrace\r\nour steps, resolved to disarm the 35th. The civil authorities in the\r\ndistrict urged that the same course should be adopted with the 33rd, a\r\nNative Infantry regiment at Hoshiarpur, about twenty-seven miles from\r\nJullundur, which it had been decided should join the column. The\r\nNative soldiers with the column already exceeded the Europeans in\r\nnumber, and as the addition of another regiment would make the odds\r\nagainst us very serious, it was arranged to disarm the 35th before the\r\n33rd joined us.\r\n\r\nWe left Jullundur on the 24th June, and that afternoon, accompanied by\r\nthe Deputy-Commissioner of the district, I rode to Philour to choose a\r\nplace for the disarming parade. The next morning we started early, the\r\nEuropeans heading the column, and when they reached the ground we had\r\nselected they took up a position on the right of the road, the two\r\nbatteries in the centre and the 52nd in wings on either flank. The\r\nguns were unlimbered and prepared for action. On the left of the road\r\nwas a serai,[11] behind which the officer commanding the 35th was told\r\nto take his regiment, and, as he cleared it, to wheel to the right,\r\nthus bringing his men in column of companies facing the line of\r\nEuropeans. This manoeuvre being accomplished, I was ordered to tell\r\nthe commanding officer that the regiment was to be disarmed, and that\r\nthe men were to pile arms and take off their belts. The sepoys and\r\ntheir British officers were equally taken aback; the latter had\r\nreceived no information of what was going to happen, while the former\r\nhad cherished the hope that they would be able to cross the Sutlej,\r\nand thence slip off with their arms to Delhi.\r\n\r\nI thought I could discover relief in the British officers' faces,\r\ncertainly in that of Major Younghusband, the Commandant, and when I\r\ngave him the General's order, he murmured, 'Thank God!' He had been\r\nwith the 35th for thirty-three years; he had served with it at the\r\nsiege of Bhurtpore, throughout the first Afghan war, and in Sale's\r\ndefence of Jalalabad; he had been proud of his old corps, but knowing\r\nprobably that his men could no longer be trusted, he rejoiced to feel\r\nthat they were not to be given the opportunity for further disgracing\r\nthemselves.[12] The sepoys obeyed the command without a word, and in a\r\nfew minutes their muskets and belts were all packed in carts and taken\r\noff to the fort.\r\n\r\nAs the ceremony was completed, the 33rd arrived and was dealt with in\r\na similar manner; but the British officers of this regiment did not\r\ntake things so quietly--they still believed in their men, and the\r\nColonel, Sandeman, trusted them to any extent. He had been with the\r\nregiment for more than two-and-thirty years, and had commanded it\r\nthroughout the Sutlej campaign. On hearing the General's order, he\r\nexclaimed: 'What! disarm my regiment? I will answer with my life for\r\nthe loyalty of every man!' On my repeating the order the poor old\r\nfellow burst into tears. His son, the late Sir Robert Sandeman, who\r\nwas an Ensign in the regiment at the time, told me afterwards how\r\nterribly his father felt the disgrace inflicted upon the regiment of\r\nwhich he was so proud.\r\n\r\nIt was known that the wing of the 9th Light Cavalry was in\r\ncommunication with the mutineers at Delhi, and that the men were only\r\nwaiting their opportunity; so they would also certainly have been\r\ndisarmed at this time, but for the idea that such a measure might have\r\na bad effect on the other wing, which still remained at Sialkot. The\r\nturn of this regiment, however, came a few days later.\r\n\r\nUp till this time we all hoped that Delhi was our destination, but,\r\ngreatly to our surprise and disappointment, orders came that morning\r\ndirecting the column to return to Umritsar; the state of the Punjab\r\nwas causing considerable anxiety, as there were several stations at\r\nwhich Native corps still remained in possession of their arms.\r\n\r\nThe same afternoon I was in the Philour fort with Nicholson, when\r\nthe telegraph-signaller gave him a copy of a message from Sir Henry\r\nBarnard to the authorities in the Punjab, begging that all Artillery\r\nofficers not doing regimental duty might be sent to Delhi, where their\r\nservices were urgently required. I at once felt that this message\r\napplied to me. I had been longing to find myself at Delhi, and lived\r\nin perpetual dread of its being captured before I could get there; now\r\nat last my hopes seemed about to be realized in a legitimate\r\nmanner, but, on the other hand, I did not like the idea of leaving\r\nNicholson--the more closely I was associated with him the more I was\r\nattracted by him--and I am always proud to remember that he did not\r\nwish to part with me. He agreed, however, that my first duty was to my\r\nregiment, and only stipulated that before leaving him I should find\r\nsomeone to take my place, as he did not know a single officer with the\r\ncolumn. This I was able to arrange, and that evening Nicholson and I\r\ndined _tête-à-tête_. At dawn the next morning I left by mail-cart for\r\nDelhi, my only kit being a small bundle of bedding, saddle and bridle,\r\nmy servants having orders to follow with my horses, tents, and other\r\nbelongings.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: One Cavalry and two Infantry.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Native Adjutant.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: A name applied by the Hindus to any Rajput who has, or\r\nwhose ancestors have, been converted to Islam. There were several\r\n_Rangars_ in the 1st Irregulars. One day in June, Shaidad Khan, a\r\nResaidar of this class, came to Chamberlain, and said: 'There was a\r\nrumour that he (Chamberlain) had not as much confidence in _Rangars_\r\nas in other classes of the regiment, and he came to be comforted'!\r\nChamberlain asked him to sit down, and sent to the banker of the\r\nregiment for a very valuable sword which he had given him for safe\r\ncustody. It had belonged to one of the Amirs of Sindh, was taken in\r\nbattle, and given to Chamberlain by Major Fitzgerald, of the Sindh\r\nHorse. On the sword being brought, Chamberlain handed it over to\r\nShaidad Khan and his sect for safety, to be returned when the Mutiny\r\nwas over. The tears rose to the Native officer's eyes, he touched\r\nChamberlain's knees, and swore that death alone would sever the bond\r\nof fidelity of which the sword was the token. He took his leave,\r\nthoroughly satisfied.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Throne.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: A station since abandoned for Rajanpur.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Now General Sir W. T.

Ricketts's bungalow was a resting-place for\r\neveryone passing through _en route_ to Delhi. In one room I found\r\nLieutenant Williams of the 4th Sikhs, who had been dangerously wounded\r\nthree weeks before, while assisting Ricketts to prevent the Jullundur\r\nmutineers from crossing the Sutlej.\r\n\r\nWhile I was eating my breakfast, Ricketts sat down by my side and\r\nrecounted a stirring tale of all that had happened at Philour\r\nand Ludhiana consequent on the rising of the Native regiments at\r\nJullundur. The mutineers had made, in the first instance, for Philour,\r\na small cantonment, but important from the fact of its containing a\r\nfair-sized magazine, and from its situation, commanding the passage\r\nof the Sutlej. It was garrisoned by the 3rd Native Infantry, which\r\nfurnished the sole guard over the magazine--a danger which, as I have\r\nmentioned, had fortunately been recognized by the Commander-in-Chief\r\nwhen he first heard of the outbreak at Meerut. The men of the 3rd\r\nremained quiet, and even did good service in helping to drag the guns\r\nof the siege-train across the river, and in guarding the treasury,\r\nuntil the mutineers from Jullundur arrived on the 8th June. They then\r\ngave their British officers warning to leave them, saying they did not\r\nmean to injure them or their property, but they had determined they\r\nwould no longer serve the _Sirkar_. Twelve British officers (there\r\ncould not have been more), confronted by 3,000 sepoys, felt themselves\r\npowerless, and retired to the fort.\r\n\r\nRicketts had with him at that time an assistant named Thornton,[2] who\r\nhad gone to Philour to lodge some money in the treasury. This officer\r\nhad started to ride back to Ludhiana, when he suddenly became aware of\r\nwhat had happened, and how perilous was the position. Had he consulted\r\nhis own safety, he would have returned and taken refuge in the\r\nfort, instead of which he galloped on, having to pass close by the\r\nmutineers, until he reached the bridge of boats, which, with admirable\r\ncoolness and presence of mind, he cut behind him, then, hurrying on,\r\nhe informed Ricketts of what had taken place; and that the rebels\r\nmight shortly be expected to attempt the passage of the river.\r\nFortunately the 4th Sikhs from Abbottabad had that very morning\r\nmarched into Ludhiana, and Ricketts hoped, with their assistance, to\r\nhold the sepoys in check until the arrival of the British troops,\r\nwhich he believed must have been despatched from Jullundur in pursuit\r\nof the mutineers.\r\n\r\nThe garrison of Ludhiana consisted of a detachment of the 3rd Native\r\nInfantry, guarding the fort, in which was stored a large amount of\r\npowder. The detachment was commanded by Lieutenant Yorke, who, on\r\nhearing Thornton's story, went at once to the fort. He was much liked\r\nby his men, who received him quite civilly, but told him they knew\r\nthat their regiment had joined the rebels from Jullundur, and that\r\nthey themselves could no longer obey his orders. Ricketts then\r\nunderstood that he had but the 4th Sikhs and a small party of troops\r\nbelonging to the Raja of Nabha to depend upon. There were only\r\ntwo officers with the 4th Sikhs--Captain Rothney, in command, and\r\nLieutenant Williams, the Adjutant. Taking three companies of the\r\nregiment under Williams, and two guns of the Nabha Artillery, one\r\ndragged by camels, the other by horses, Ricketts started off towards\r\nthe bridge of boats. Galloping on alone, he found that the gap in the\r\nbridge made by Thornton had not been repaired, which proved that the\r\nrebels had not crossed by that passage, at all events. He widened the\r\ngap by cutting adrift some more boats, and then had himself ferried\r\nacross the river, in order to ascertain the exact state of affairs at\r\nPhilour. He learnt that no tidings had been received of any British\r\ntroops having been sent from Jullundur in pursuit of the mutineers,\r\nwho, having failed to get across the bridge, owing to Thornton's\r\ntimely action, had gone to a ferry reported to be three miles up the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nRicketts recrossed the river as quickly as he could, and joined\r\nWilliams. It was then getting dark, but, hoping they might still be\r\nin time to check the rebels, they pushed on in the direction of the\r\nferry, which proved to be nearer six than three miles away. The ground\r\nwas rough and broken, as is always the case on the banks of Indian\r\nrivers, swollen as they often are by torrents from the hills, which\r\nleave behind boulders and debris of all kinds. They made but little\r\nway; one of the gun-camels fell lame, the guides disappeared, and they\r\nbegan to despair of reaching the ferry in time, when suddenly there\r\nwas a challenge and they know they were too late. The sepoys had\r\nsucceeded in crossing the river and were bivouacking immediately in\r\nfront of them.\r\n\r\nIt was not a pleasant position, but it had to be made the best of; and\r\nboth the civilian and the soldier agreed that their only chance was\r\nto fight. Williams opened fire with his Infantry, and Ricketts took\r\ncommand of the guns. At the first discharge the horses bolted with the\r\nlimber, and never appeared again; almost at the same moment Williams\r\nfell, shot through the body. Ricketts continued the fight until his\r\nammunition was completely expended, when he was reluctantly obliged to\r\nretire to a village in the neighbourhood, but not until he had killed,\r\nas he afterwards discovered, about fifty of the enemy.\r\n\r\nRicketts returned to Ludhiana early the next morning, and later in\r\nthe day the mutineers passed through the city. They released some 500\r\nprisoners who were in the gaol, and helped themselves to what food\r\nthey wanted, but they did not enter the cantonment or the fort. The\r\ngallant little attempt to close the passage of the Sutlej was entirely\r\nfrustrated, owing to the inconceivable want of energy displayed by the\r\nso-called 'pursuing force'; had it pushed on, the rebels must have\r\nbeen caught in the act of crossing the river, when Ricketts's small\r\nparty might have afforded considerable help. The Europeans from\r\nJullundur reached Philour before dark on the 8th; they heard the\r\nfiring of Ricketts's guns, but no attempt was made by the officer in\r\ncommand to ascertain the cause, and they came leisurely on to Ludhiana\r\nthe following day.\r\n\r\nHaving listened with the greatest interest to Ricketts's story, and\r\nrefreshed the inner man, I resumed my journey, and reached Umballa\r\nlate in the afternoon of the 27th, not sorry to get under shelter, for\r\nthe monsoon, which had been threatening for some days past, burst with\r\ngreat fury as I was leaving Ludhiana.\r\n\r\nOn driving to the dâk-bungalow I found it crowded with officers, some\r\nof whom had been waiting there for days for an opportunity to go on to\r\nDelhi; they laughed at me when I expressed my intention of proceeding\r\nat once, and told me that the seats on the mail-carts had to be\r\nengaged several days in advance, and that I might make up my mind to\r\nstay where I was for some time to come. I was not at all prepared for\r\nthis, and I determined to get on by hook or by crook; as a preliminary\r\nmeasure, I made friends with the postmaster, from whose office the\r\nmail-carts started. From him I learnt that my only chance was to\r\ncall upon the Deputy-Commissioner, by whose orders the seats were\r\ndistributed. I took the postmaster's advice, and thus became\r\nacquainted with Douglas Forsyth, who in later years made a name for\r\nhimself by his energetic attempts to establish commercial relations\r\nwith Yarkand and Kashgar. Forsyth confirmed what I had already heard,\r\nbut told me that an extra cart was to be despatched that night, laden\r\nwith small-arm ammunition, on which I could, if I liked, get a seat,\r\nadding: 'Your kit must be of the smallest, as there will be no room\r\nfor anything inside the cart.'\r\n\r\nI returned to the dâk-bungalow, overjoyed at my success, to find\r\nmyself quite an important personage, with everyone my friend, like the\r\nboy at school who is the lucky recipient of a hamper from home. 'Take\r\nme with you!' was the cry on all sides. Only two others besides the\r\ndriver and myself could possibly go, and then only by carrying our\r\nkits in our laps. It was finally arranged that Captain Law and\r\nLieutenant Packe should be my companions. Packe was lamed for life\r\nby a shot through his ankle before we had been forty-eight hours\r\nat Delhi, and Law was killed on the 23rd July, having greatly\r\ndistinguished himself by his gallantry and coolness under fire during\r\nthe short time he served with the force.\r\n\r\nWe got to Kurnal soon after daybreak on the 28th. It was occupied by a\r\nfew of the Raja of Jhind's troops, a Commissariat officer, and one or\r\ntwo civilians, who were trying to keep the country quiet and collect\r\nsupplies. Before noon we passed through Panipat, where there was a\r\nstrong force of Patiala and Jhind troops, and early in the afternoon\r\nwe reached Alipur. Here our driver pulled up, declaring he would go no\r\nfurther. A few days before there had been a sharp fight on the road\r\nbetween Alipur and Delhi, not far from Badli-ki-Serai, where the\r\nbattle of the 8th June had taken place, and as the enemy were\r\nconstantly on the road threatening the rear of the besieging force,\r\nthe driver did not consider it safe to go on. We could not, however,\r\nstop at Alipur, so after some consultation we settled to take the\r\nmail-cart ponies and ride on to camp. We could hear the boom of guns\r\nat intervals, and as we neared Delhi we came across several dead\r\nbodies of the enemy. It is a curious fact that most of these bodies\r\nwere exactly like mummies; there was nothing disagreeable about them.\r\n\r\nWhy this should have been the case I cannot say, but I often wished\r\nduring the remainder of the campaign that the atmospheric influences,\r\nwhich, I presume, had produced this effect, could assert themselves\r\nmore frequently.\r\n\r\nWe stopped for a short time to look at the position occupied by the\r\nenemy at Badli-ki-Serai; but none of us were in the mood to enjoy\r\nsight-seeing. We had never been to Delhi before, and had but the\r\nvaguest notion where the Ridge (the position our force was holding)\r\nwas, or how the city was situated with regard to our camp. The sound\r\nof heavy firing became louder and louder, and we knew that fighting\r\nmust be going on. The driver had solemnly warned us of the risk we\r\nwere running in continuing our journey, and when we came to the point\r\nwhere the Grand Trunk Road bifurcates, one branch going direct to the\r\ncity and the other through the cantonment, we halted for a few minutes\r\nto discuss which we should take. Fortunately for us, we settled to\r\nfollow that which led to the cantonment, and, as it was then getting\r\ndark, we pushed on as fast as our tired ponies could go. The relief\r\nto us when we found ourselves safe inside our own piquets may be\r\nimagined. My father's old staff-officer, Henry Norman, who was then\r\nAssistant-Adjutant-General at Head-Quarters, kindly asked me to share\r\nhis tent until I could make other arrangements. He had no bed to offer\r\nme, but I required none, as I was thoroughly tired out, and all I\r\nwanted was a spot on which to throw myself down. A good night's rest\r\nquite set me up. I awoke early, scarcely able to believe in my good\r\nfortune. I was actually at Delhi, and the city was still in the\r\npossession of the mutineers.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: George Ricketts, Esq., C.B., afterwards a member of the\r\nBoard of Revenue of the North-West Provinces.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Thomas Thornton, Esq., C.S.I., afterwards Secretary to\r\nthe Government of India in the Foreign Department.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n1857\r\n\r\n  The first victory--Enthusiasm amongst the troops\r\n  --Barnard's success at Badli-ki-Serai--The Flagstaff Tower\r\n  --Position on the Ridge--Quintin Battye--The gallant little Gurkhas\r\n  --Proposed assault--The besiegers besieged--Hard fighting\r\n  --The centenary of Plassy\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore entering on the narrative of what came under my own observation\r\nduring the three months I was at Delhi, I will relate what took place\r\nafter Sir Henry Barnard succeeded General Anson in command on the 26th\r\nMay, and how the little British force maintained itself against almost\r\noverwhelming odds during the first three weeks of that memorable\r\nsiege.\r\n\r\nBarnard had served as Chief of the Staff in the Crimea, and had held\r\nvarious staff appointments in England; but he was an utter stranger to\r\nIndia, having only arrived in the country a few weeks before. He\r\nfully realized the difficulties of the position to which he had so\r\nunexpectedly succeeded, for he was aware how unjustly Anson was being\r\njudged by those who, knowing nothing of war, imagined he could have\r\nstarted to attack Delhi with scarcely more preparation than would have\r\nbeen necessary for a morning's parade. The officers of the column were\r\ncomplete strangers to him, and he to them, and he was ignorant of the\r\ncharacteristics and capabilities of the Native portion of his troops.\r\nIt must, therefore, have been with an anxious heart that he took over\r\nthe command.\r\n\r\nOne of Barnard's first acts was to get rid of the unreliable element\r\nwhich Anson had brought away from Umballa. The Infantry he sent to\r\nRohtuk, where it shortly afterwards mutinied, and the Cavalry to\r\nMeerut. That these troops should have been allowed to retain their\r\nweapons is one of the mysteries of the Mutiny. For more than two\r\nmonths their insubordination had been apparent, incendiarism had\r\noccurred which had been clearly traced to them, and they had even gone\r\nso far as to fire at their officers; both John Lawrence and Robert\r\nMontgomery had pressed upon the Commander-in-Chief the advisability\r\nof disarming them; but General Anson, influenced by the regimental\r\nofficers, who could not believe in the disaffection of their men, had\r\nnot grasped the necessity for this precautionary measure. The European\r\nsoldiers with the column, however, did not conceal their mistrust of\r\nthese sepoys, and Barnard acted wisely in sending them away; but it\r\nwas extraordinary that they should have been allowed to keep their\r\narms.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th June Barnard reached Alipur, within ten miles of Delhi,\r\nwhere he decided to await the arrival of the siege-train and the\r\ntroops from Meerut.\r\n\r\nThe Meerut brigade, under Brigadier Wilson, had started on the 27th\r\nMay. It consisted of two squadrons of the Carabineers, Tombs's[1]\r\ntroop of Horse Artillery, Scott's Field Battery and two 18-pounder\r\nguns, a wing of the 1st Battalion 60th Rifles, a few Native Sappers\r\nand Miners, and a detachment of Irregular Horse.\r\n\r\nEarly on the 30th the village of Ghazi-u-din-nagar (now known as\r\nGhaziabad) close to the Hindun river, and about eleven miles from\r\nDelhi, was reached. Thence it was intended to make a reconnaissance\r\ntowards Delhi, but about four o'clock in the afternoon a vedette\r\nreported that the enemy were approaching in strength. A very careless\r\nlook-out had been kept, for almost simultaneously with the report a\r\nround shot came tumbling into camp. The troops fell in as quickly as\r\npossible, and the Artillery came into action. The Rifles crossed the\r\nHindun suspension bridge, and, under cover of our guns, attacked the\r\nenemy, who were strongly posted in a village. From this position they\r\nwere speedily dislodged, and the victory was complete. Seven hundred\r\nBritish soldiers defeated seven times their number, capturing five\r\nguns and a large quantity of ammunition and stores. Our loss was one\r\nofficer and ten men killed, and one officer and eighteen men wounded.\r\n\r\nThe following day (Sunday) the enemy reappeared about noon, but\r\nafter two hours' fighting they were again routed, and on our troops\r\noccupying their position, they could be seen in full retreat towards\r\nDelhi. The rebels succeeded in taking their guns with them, for our\r\nmen, prostrated by the intense heat and parched with thirst, were\r\nquite unable to pursue. We had one officer and eleven men killed, and\r\ntwo officers and ten men wounded. Among the latter was an ensign of\r\nthe 60th Rifles, a boy named Napier, a most gallant young fellow, full\r\nof life and spirit, who had won the love as well as the admiration of\r\nhis men. He was hit in the leg, and the moment he was brought into\r\ncamp it had to be amputated. When the operation was over, Napier was\r\nheard to murmur, 'I shall never lead the Rifles again! I shall never\r\nlead the Rifles again!' His wound he thought little of. What grieved\r\nhim was the idea of having to give up his career as a soldier, and to\r\nleave the regiment he was so proud of. Napier was taken to Meerut,\r\nwhere he died a few days afterwards.[2]\r\n\r\nOn the 1st June Wilson's force was strengthened by the Sirmur\r\nbattalion of Gurkhas,[3] a regiment which later covered itself with\r\nglory, and gained an undying name by its gallantry during the siege of\r\nDelhi.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th June Wilson's brigade crossed the Jumna at Baghput, and\r\nat Alipur it joined Barnard's force, the men of which loudly cheered\r\ntheir Meerut comrades as they marched into camp with the captured\r\nguns. The siege-train had arrived the previous day, and Barnard was\r\nnow ready for an advance. His force consisted of about 600 Cavalry and\r\n2,400 Infantry, with 22 field-guns. There were besides 150 European\r\nArtillerymen, chiefly recruits, with the siege-train, which comprised\r\neight 18-pounders, four 8-inch and twelve 5-1/2-inch mortars. The\r\nguns, if not exactly obsolete, were quite unsuited for the work that\r\nhad to be done, but they were the best procurable. George Campbell, in\r\nhis 'Memoirs of my Indian Career,' thus describes the siege-train as\r\nhe saw it passing through Kurnal: 'I could not help thinking that it\r\nlooked a very trumpery affair with which to bombard and take a great\r\nfortified city;' and he expressed his 'strong belief that Delhi would\r\nnever be taken by that battery.'\r\n\r\nBarnard heard that the enemy intended to oppose his march to Delhi,\r\nand in order to ascertain their exact position he sent Lieutenant\r\nHodson (who had previously done good service for the Commander-in-Chief\r\nby opening communication with Meerut) to reconnoitre the road. Hodson\r\nreported that the rebels were in force at Badli-ki-Serai a little more\r\nthan halfway between Alipur and Delhi. Orders were accordingly issued\r\nfor an advance at midnight on the 7th June.\r\n\r\nWhen it became known that a battle was imminent, there was great\r\nenthusiasm amongst the troops, who were burning to avenge the\r\nmassacres of Meerut and Delhi. The sick in hospital declared they\r\nwould remain there no longer, and many, quite unfit to walk, insisted\r\non accompanying the attacking column, imploring their comrades not to\r\nmention that they were ill, for fear they should not be allowed to\r\ntake part in the fight.[4]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAJOR-GENERAL SIR HARRY TOMBS, V.C., G.C.B.\r\n\r\n_From a photograph by Messrs. Grillet and Co._]\r\n\r\nThe mutineers had selected an admirable position on both sides of the\r\nmain road. To their right was a serai and a walled village capable\r\nof holding large numbers of Infantry, and protected by an impassable\r\nswamp. To their left, on some rising ground, a sand-bag battery for\r\nfour heavy guns and an 8-inch mortar had been constructed. On both\r\nsides the ground was swampy and intersected by water-cuts, and about\r\na mile to the enemy's left, and nearly parallel to the road, ran the\r\nWestern Jumna Canal.\r\n\r\nAt the hour named, Brigadier Hope Grant,[5] commanding the Cavalry,\r\nstarted with ten Horse Artillery guns, three squadrons of the 9th\r\nLancers, and fifty Jhind horsemen under Lieutenant Hodson, with the\r\nobject of turning the enemy's left flank. Shortly afterwards the main\r\nbody marched along the road until the lights in the enemy's camp\r\nbecame visible. Colonel Showers, who had succeeded Hallifax in the\r\ncommand of the 1st Brigade,[6] moved off to the right of the road, and\r\nColonel Graves, who had taken Jones's place with the 2nd Brigade,[7]\r\nto the left. The heavy guns remained on the road with a battery of\r\nField Artillery on either flank. Just as day broke our guns advanced,\r\nbut before they were in position the fight began by a cannonade from\r\nthe rebel Artillery, which caused us severe loss. To this destructive\r\nfire no adequate reply could be made; our guns were too few and of too\r\nsmall calibre. To add to our difficulties, the Native bullock-drivers\r\nof our heavy guns went off with their cattle, and one of the waggons\r\nblew up. At this critical moment Barnard ordered Showers to charge the\r\nenemy's guns, a service which was performed with heroic gallantry by\r\nHer Majesty's 75th Foot, who carried the position at the point of the\r\nbayonet, with a loss of 19 officers and men killed and 43 wounded.\r\nThen, supported by the 1st Fusiliers, the same regiment dashed across\r\nthe road and burst open the gates of the serai. A desperate fight\r\nensued, but the sepoys were no match for British bayonets, and\r\nthey now learnt that their misdeeds were not to be allowed to go\r\nunpunished. Graves's brigade, having passed round the _jhil_,[8]\r\nappeared on the enemy's right rear, while Grant with his Cavalry and\r\nHorse Artillery threatened their left. The defeat was complete, and\r\nthe rebels retreated hastily towards Delhi, leaving their guns on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nAlthough the men were much exhausted, Barnard determined to push on,\r\nfor he feared that if he delayed the rebels might rally, and occupy\r\nanother strong position.\r\n\r\nFrom the cross-roads just beyond Badli-ki-Serai could be seen the\r\nRidge on which the British force was to hold its own for more than\r\nthree months during the heat of an Indian summer, and under the rain\r\nof an Indian monsoon. At this point two columns were formed, Barnard\r\ntaking command of the one, which proceeded to the left towards the\r\ncantonment, and Wilson of the other, which moved along the city road.\r\nWilson's column fought its way through gardens and enclosures until it\r\nreached the western extremity of the Ridge. Barnard, as he came under\r\nthe fire of the enemy's guns, made a flank movement to the left, and\r\nthen, wheeling to his right, swept along the Ridge from the Flagstaff\r\nTower to Hindu Rao's house, where the two columns united, the rebels\r\nflying before them.\r\n\r\nBarnard had achieved a great success and with comparatively small\r\nloss, considering the formidable position occupied by the enemy, their\r\ngreat strength in Artillery, and their superiority in numbers.\r\n\r\nOur casualties were 51 killed and 131 wounded. Among the former was\r\nColonel Chester, the Adjutant-General of the Army. Of the troops\r\nopposed to us it was reckoned that 1,000 never returned to Delhi;\r\nthirteen guns were captured, two of them being 24-pounders.\r\n\r\nI have frequently wandered over the Ridge since 1857, and thought how\r\nwonderfully we were aided by finding a ready-made position--not only a\r\ncoign of vantage for attack, but a rampart of defence, as Forrest[9]\r\ndescribes it. This Ridge, rising sixty feet above the city, covered\r\nthe main line of communication to the Punjab, upon the retention of\r\nwhich our very existence as a force depended. Its left rested on the\r\nJumna, unfordable from the time the snow on the higher ranges begins\r\nto melt until the rainy season is over, and of sufficient width to\r\nprevent our being enfiladed by field-guns; although, on the immediate\r\nright, bazaars, buildings, and garden-walls afforded cover to the\r\nenemy, the enclosed nature of the ground was so far advantageous that\r\nit embarrassed and impeded them in their attempts to organize an\r\nattack in force upon our flank or rear; and a further protection was\r\nafforded by the Najafgarh _jhil_, which during the rains submerges a\r\nvast area of land.\r\n\r\nThe distance of the Ridge from the city walls varied considerably. On\r\nour right, where the memorial monument now stands, it was about 1,200\r\nyards, at the Flagstaff Tower about a mile and a half, and at the end\r\nnear the river nearly two miles and a half. This rendered our left\r\ncomparatively safe, and it was behind the Ridge in this direction that\r\nthe main part of our camp was pitched. The Flagstaff Tower in the\r\ncentre was the general rendezvous for the non-combatants, and for\r\nthose of the sick and wounded who were able to move about, as they\r\ncould assemble there and hear the news from the front without much\r\nrisk of injury from the enemy's fire.\r\n\r\nThe Flagstaff Tower is interesting from the fact that it was here the\r\nresidents from the cantonment of Delhi assembled to make a stand,\r\non hearing that the rebels from Meerut were murdering the British\r\nofficers on duty within the city, that the three Native regiments and\r\nbattery of Field Artillery had joined the mutineers, and that at any\r\nmoment they themselves might expect to be attacked. The tower was 150\r\nfeet high, with a low parapet running round the top, approached by a\r\nnarrow winding staircase. Here the men of the party proposed to await\r\nthe attack. The ladies, who behaved with the utmost coolness and\r\npresence of mind, were, with the wives and children of the few\r\nEuropean non-commissioned officers, placed for their greater safety on\r\nthe stairs, where they were all but suffocated by the stifling heat in\r\nsuch a confined space. The little party on the roof consisted of some\r\ntwenty British officers, the same number of half-caste buglers and\r\ndrummers, and half a dozen European soldiers. Not a drop of water, not\r\na particle of food, was to be had. No help appeared to be coming from\r\nMeerut, in the direction of which place many a longing and expectant\r\nglance had been cast during the anxious hours of that miserable 11th\r\nMay. Constant and heavy firing was heard from the city and suburbs,\r\nand the Cavalry were reported to be advancing on the cantonment.\r\n\r\nBefore evening the weary watchers realized that their position was\r\nuntenable, and that their only possible chance of escaping the fate\r\nwhich had befallen the officers within the city (whose dead bodies had\r\nbeen inhumanly sent in a cart to the Tower) lay in flight. Shortly\r\nbefore dark the move was made, the women and children were crowded\r\ninto the few vehicles available, and accompanied by the men, some on\r\nfoot and some on horseback, they got away by the road leading towards\r\nUmballa. They were only just in time, for before the last of the party\r\nwere out of sight of the cantonment, crowds of Natives poured into it,\r\nburning, plundering, and destroying everything they could find.\r\n\r\nAmongst the fugitives from Delhi was Captain Tytler, of the 38th\r\nNative Infantry, who, after a variety of vicissitudes, reached Umballa\r\nsafely with his wife and children. When Anson's force was being formed\r\nfor the advance on Delhi, Tytler was placed in charge of the military\r\ntreasure chest, and through some unaccountable negligence Mrs. Tytler\r\nwas allowed to accompany him. I believe that, when Mrs. Tytler's\r\npresence became known to the authorities, she would have been sent\r\nout of camp to some safe place, but at that time she was not in a fit\r\nstate to travel, and on the 21st June, a few days after the force took\r\nup its position under a heavy cannonade, she gave birth to a son\r\nin the waggon in which she was accommodated. The infant, who was\r\nchristened Stanley Delhi Force, seems to have been looked upon by the\r\nsoldiery with quite a superstitious feeling, for the father tells us\r\nthat soon after its birth he overheard a soldier say; 'Now we shall\r\nget our reinforcements; this camp was formed to avenge the blood\r\nof innocents, and the first reinforcement sent to us is a new-born\r\ninfant.' Reinforcements did actually arrive the next day.\r\n\r\nIt was on the afternoon of the 8th June that the British force was\r\nplaced in position on the Ridge. The main piquet was established at\r\nHindu Rao's house, a large stone building, in former days the country\r\nresidence of some Mahratta Chief. About one hundred and eighty yards\r\nfurther to the left was the observatory, near which our heavy gun\r\nbattery was erected. Beyond the observatory was an old Pathan mosque,\r\nin which was placed an Infantry piquet with two field-guns. Still\r\nfurther to the left came the Flagstaff Tower, held by a party of\r\nInfantry with two more field-guns. At the extreme right of the Ridge,\r\noverlooking the trunk road, there was a strong piquet with a heavy\r\nbattery.\r\n\r\nThis was the weak point of our defence. To the right, and somewhat\r\nto the rear, was the suburb of Sabzi Mandi (vegetable market), a\r\nsuccession of houses and walled gardens, from which the rebels\r\nconstantly threatened our flank. To protect this part of the position\r\nas much as possible, a battery of three 18-pounders and an Infantry\r\npiquet was placed on what was known as the General's Mound, with a\r\nCavalry piquet and two Horse Artillery guns immediately below.\r\nIn front of the Ridge the ground was covered with old buildings,\r\nenclosures, and clumps of trees, which afforded only too perfect\r\nshelter to the enemy when making their sorties.\r\n\r\nAs described by the Commanding Engineer, 'the eastern face of Delhi\r\nrests on the Jumna, and at the season of the year during which our\r\noperations were carried on, the stream may be described as washing the\r\nface of the walls. The river front was therefore inaccessible to\r\nthe besieging force, while at the same time the mutineers and the\r\ninhabitants of the city could communicate freely across the river by\r\nmeans of the bridge of boats and ferries. This rendered it impossible\r\nfor us to invest Delhi, even if there had been a sufficient number\r\nof troops for the purpose. We were only able, indeed, to direct our\r\nattack against a small portion of the city wall, while throughout the\r\nsiege the enemy could freely communicate with, and procure supplies\r\nfrom, the surrounding country.\r\n\r\n'On the river front the defences consisted of an irregular wall with\r\noccasional bastions and towers, and about one half of the length of\r\nthis face was occupied by the palace of the King of Delhi and its\r\noutwork, the old Moghul fort of Selimgarh.\r\n\r\n'The remaining defences consisted of a succession of bastioned fronts,\r\nthe connecting curtains being very long, and the outworks limited\r\nto one crown-work at the Ajmir gate, and Martello towers mounting a\r\nsingle gun, at the points where additional flanking fire to that given\r\nby the bastions themselves was required.'[10]\r\n\r\nThe above description will give some idea of the strength of the great\r\ncity which the British force had come to capture. For more than two\r\nmonths, however, our energies were devoted not to capturing the city,\r\nbut to defending ourselves, having to be ever on the watch to guard\r\nour communication with the Punjab, and to repel the enemy's almost\r\ndaily sorties.\r\n\r\nThe defences of Delhi, which remain almost unaltered up to the present\r\nday, were modernized forms of the ancient works that existed when\r\nthe city fell before Lord Lake's army in 1803. These works had been\r\nstrengthened and improved some years before the Mutiny by Lieutenant\r\nRobert Napier.[11] How thoroughly and effectually that talented and\r\ndistinguished Engineer performed the duty entrusted to him, we who had\r\nto attack Delhi could testify to our cost.\r\n\r\nBarnard was not left long in doubt as to the intentions of the rebels,\r\nwho, the very afternoon on which he occupied the Ridge, attacked Hindu\r\nRao's house, where the Sirmur battalion, two companies of the 60th\r\nRifles, and two of Scott's guns had been placed. The enemy were driven\r\noff before dark. The following day they began to cannonade from the\r\ncity walls, and in the afternoon repeated their attack.\r\n\r\nThat same morning a welcome reinforcement reached camp, the famous\r\nCorps of Guides having arrived as fresh as if they had returned from\r\nan ordinary field day, instead of having come off a march of nearly\r\n600 miles, accomplished in the incredibly short time of twenty-two\r\ndays, at the most trying season of the year. The General, having\r\ninspected them, said a few words of encouragement to the men, who\r\nbegged their gallant Commandant to say how proud they were to belong\r\nto the Delhi Force. Their usefulness was proved that same afternoon,\r\nwhen, in support of the piquets, they engaged the enemy in a\r\nhand-to-hand contest, and drove them back to the city.\r\n\r\nIt was close up to the walls that Quintin Battye, the dashing\r\nCommander of the Guides Cavalry, received his mortal wound. He was the\r\nbrightest and cheeriest of companions, and although only a subaltern\r\nof eight years' service, he was a great loss. I spent a few hours with\r\nhim on my way to Delhi, and I remember how his handsome face glowed\r\nwhen he talked of the opportunities for distinguishing themselves in\r\nstore for the Guides. Proud of his regiment, and beloved by his men,\r\nwho, grand fellows themselves, were captivated by his many soldierly\r\nqualities, he had every prospect before him of a splendid career, but\r\nhe was destined to fall in his first fight. He was curiously fond of\r\nquotations, and the last words he uttered were '_Dulce et decorum est\r\npro patriâ mori_.'\r\n\r\nWhile our Infantry and Field Artillery were busily engaged with the\r\nenemy, the few heavy guns we had were put in position on the Ridge.\r\nGreat things were hoped from them, but it was soon found that they\r\nwere not powerful enough to silence the enemy's fire, and that our\r\nsmall supply of ammunition was being rapidly expended.[12] The rebels'\r\nguns were superior in number and some in calibre to ours, and were\r\nwell served by the Native Artillerymen whom we had been at such pains\r\nto teach. Barnard discovered, too, that his deficiencies in men and\r\n_matériel_ prevented regular approaches being made. There were only\r\n150 Native Sappers and Miners with our force, and Infantry could not\r\nbe spared for working parties.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th June another determined attack was made on Hindu Rao's\r\nhouse, which was repulsed by the Sirmur battalion of Gurkhas under its\r\ndistinguished Commandant, Major Reid.[13] The mutineers quite hoped\r\nthat the Gurkhas would join them, and as they were advancing they\r\ncalled out: 'We are not firing; we want to speak to you; we want you\r\nto join us.' The little Gurkhas replied, 'Oh yes; we are coming,' on\r\nwhich they advanced to within twenty paces of the rebels, and, firing\r\na well-directed volley, killed nearly thirty of them.\r\n\r\nThe next day the insurgents made a third attack, and were again\r\nrepulsed with considerable loss. They knew that Hindu Rao's house was\r\nthe key of our position, and throughout the siege they made the most\r\ndesperate attempts to capture it. But Barnard had entrusted this\r\npost of danger to the Gurkhas, and all efforts to dislodge them were\r\nunavailing. At first Reid had at his command only his own battalion\r\nand two companies of the 60th Rifles; but on the arrival of the Guides\r\ntheir Infantry were also placed at his disposal, and whenever he\r\nsounded the alarm he was reinforced by two more companies of the 60th.\r\nHindu Rao's house was within easy range of nearly all the enemy's\r\nheavy guns, and was riddled through and through with shot and shell.\r\nReid never quitted the Ridge save to attack the enemy, and never once\r\nvisited the camp until carried into it severely wounded on the day of\r\nthe final assault. Hindu Rao's house was the little Gurkhas' hospital\r\nas well as their barrack, for their sick and wounded begged to be left\r\nwith their comrades instead of being taken to camp.[14]\r\n\r\nFailing in their attempts on the centre of the position, the mutineers\r\nsoon after daylight on the 12th, having concealed themselves in the\r\nravines adjoining Metcalfe House, attacked the Flagstaff Tower, the\r\npiquet of which was composed of two Horse Artillery guns and two\r\ncompanies of the 75th Foot, under the command of Captains Dunbar and\r\nKnox. A heavy fog and thick mist rolling up from the low ground near\r\nthe Jumna completely enveloped the Ridge and the left front of our\r\nposition, hiding everything in the immediate vicinity. The piquet\r\nwas on the point of being relieved by a detachment of the 2nd\r\nBengal Fusiliers, when a large body of the enemy, who had crept up\r\nunobserved, made a rush at the Flagstaff Tower, and as nearly as\r\npossible captured the guns. The piquet was hardly pressed, Knox\r\nand several men were killed, and but for the timely arrival of two\r\ncompanies of the 60th, the rebels would have gained the day.\r\n\r\nThis engagement was scarcely over, when masses of insurgents advanced\r\nfrom the Sabzi Mandi upon Hindu Rao's house, and into the gardens on\r\nthe right flank of the camp, threatening the Mound piquet. Reserves\r\nwere called up, these attacks, in their turn, were repulsed and the\r\nrebels were pursued for some distance. It was most fortunate that\r\nboth attacks did not take place simultaneously, as was the obvious\r\nintention of the enemy, for our strength would not have been\r\nsufficient to repel them both at the same moment.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent the mutineers from coming to such close quarters\r\nagain, a piquet was placed in Metcalfe's House, and the Mound to the\r\nrear of the ridge facing the Sabzi Mandi was strengthened. These\r\nprecautions ought to, and would, have been taken before, but for the\r\nwant of men. Our soldiers were scarcely ever off duty, and this fresh\r\ndemand made it impossible at times to provide a daily relief for the\r\nseveral piquets.\r\n\r\nOur resources in siege guns and ammunition were so limited, daily\r\nsorties, disease, and heat were making such ravages amongst our\r\nsmall force, there was so little hope of receiving any considerable\r\nreinforcements, and it appeared to be of such paramount importance to\r\ncapture Delhi without further delay, that Barnard agreed to a proposal\r\nfor taking it by a _coup de main_.\r\n\r\nThe particular details of the project and disposition of the troops\r\nwere worked out by three young officers of Engineers, under the direct\r\norders of the General, and were kept a profound secret; even the\r\nCommanding Engineer was not made acquainted with them. Secrecy was, of\r\ncourse, of vital importance, but that the officers who ought to have\r\nbeen chiefly concerned were kept in ignorance of the scheme, shows\r\nthere was little of that confidence so essential to success existing\r\nbetween the Commander and those who were in the position of his\r\nprincipal advisers. Practically the whole force was to be engaged,\r\ndivided into three columns--one to enter by the Kashmir gate, the\r\nsecond by the Lahore gate, and the third was to attempt an escalade.\r\nThe three columns, if they succeeded in effecting an entrance, were to\r\nwork their way to the centre of the city, and there unite.\r\n\r\nIt was intended that these columns should move off from camp so as to\r\narrive at the walls just before daybreak; accordingly, at one o'clock\r\non the morning of the 13th June the troops were suddenly paraded and\r\nammunition served out, and then for the first time the Commanders\r\nof the three columns and the staff were made acquainted with the\r\nGeneral's intentions. It so happened that the 75th Foot, which had\r\nfollowed the enemy into the grounds of Metcalfe House after the\r\nrepulse on the Flagstaff Tower the previous morning, had through some\r\noversight never been recalled; their absence was only discovered when\r\nthe order was given for the regiment to turn out, and a considerable\r\ntime was wasted in sending for it and bringing it back to camp. Day\r\nwas breaking when this regiment received its ammunition, and all hope\r\nof an unperceived advance to the walls had to be given up. The\r\ntroops were therefore dismissed, and allowed to turn in, having been\r\nuselessly disturbed from their much-needed rest.\r\n\r\nThe failure to give effect to the young Engineer officers' plan may be\r\nlooked upon as a merciful dispensation of Providence, which saved us\r\nfrom what would almost certainly have been an irreparable disaster.\r\nWhen we think of the hard fighting encountered when the assault did\r\ntake place under much more favourable circumstances, and how the\r\ncolumns at the end of that day were only just able to get inside the\r\ncity, those who had practical knowledge of the siege can judge what\r\nchance there would have been of these smaller columns accomplishing\r\ntheir object, even if they had been able to take the enemy by\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\nThe 13th and 14th passed in comparative quiet; but early on the 15th\r\na strong force advanced from Delhi against the Metcalfe House piquet,\r\nwith the object of turning our left flank, but it was driven back with\r\nconsiderable loss.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th we were attacked from almost every direction--a manoeuvre\r\nintended to prevent our observing a battery which was being\r\nconstructed close to an Idgah,[15] situated on a hill to our right,\r\nfrom which to enfilade our position on the Ridge. As it was very\r\nimportant to prevent the completion of this battery, Barnard ordered\r\nit to be attacked by two small columns, one commanded by Tombs, of the\r\nBengal Horse Artillery, the other by Reid. Tombs, with 400 of the 60th\r\nRifles and 1st Bengal Fusiliers, 30 of the Guides Cavalry, 20 Sappers\r\nand Miners, and his own troop of Horse Artillery, moved towards the\r\nenemy's left, while Reid, with four companies of the 60th and some\r\nof his own Gurkhas, advanced through Kishenganj against their right.\r\nTombs drove the rebels through a succession of gardens till they\r\nreached the Idgah, where they made an obstinate but unavailing\r\nresistance. The gates of the mosque were blown open, and thirty-nine\r\nof its defenders were killed. Tombs himself was slightly wounded, and\r\nhad two horses killed, making five which had been shot under this\r\ngallant soldier since the commencement of the campaign. Reid's attack\r\nwas equally successful. He completely destroyed the battery, and\r\ninflicted heavy loss on the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe next day but one the rebels issued from the city in great force,\r\nand threatened nearly every part of our position. The fighting was\r\nsevere throughout the afternoon, the piquets having again and again\r\nto be reinforced. Towards evening, while nearly all the Infantry were\r\nthus engaged, a large party of the insurgents, passing unperceived\r\nthrough the suburbs and gardens on our right, reappeared about a mile\r\nand a half to our rear. Very few troops were left in camp, and all\r\nHope Grant, who was in command at the time, could collect was four or\r\nfive squadrons of Cavalry and twelve guns. He found the enemy in a\r\nstrong position, against which his light guns could make but little\r\nimpression, while their Artillery and well-placed Infantry did us\r\nconsiderable damage. Tombs's troop especially suffered, and at one\r\ntime his guns were in imminent danger of being captured. Just at\r\nthis moment some of the Guides Cavalry rode up. 'Daly, if you do not\r\ncharge,' called out Tombs, 'my guns are taken.' Daly spurred into the\r\nbushes, followed by about a dozen of his gallant Guides. He returned\r\nwith a bullet through his shoulder, but the momentary diversion saved\r\nthe guns.[16]\r\n\r\nAs long as it was light the steady fire of the Artillery and the\r\ndashing charges of the Cavalry kept the rebels in check; but in the\r\ndusk of the evening their superior numbers told: they very nearly\r\nsucceeded in turning our flank, and for some time the guns were again\r\nin great jeopardy; the 9th Lancers and Guides, bent on saving them at\r\nall hazards, charged the enemy; but, with a ditch and houses on each\r\nside, their action was paralyzed, and their loss severe. All was now\r\nin confusion, the disorder increasing as night advanced, when a small\r\nbody of Infantry (about 300 of the 60th Rifles) came up, dashed\r\nforward, and, cutting a lane through the rebels, rescued the guns.[17]\r\n\r\nOur loss in this affair amounted to 3 officers and 17 men killed, and\r\n7 officers and 70 men wounded. Among the latter was Hope Grant,\r\nwho had his horse shot under him in a charge, and was saved by the\r\ndevotion of two men of his own regiment (the 9th Lancers) and a\r\nMahomedan sowar of the 4th Irregular Cavalry.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly midnight before the troops returned to camp. The enemy\r\nhad been frustrated in their attempt to force our rear, but they had\r\nnot been driven back; we had, indeed, been only just able to hold our\r\nown. The result of the day added considerably to the anxiety of the\r\nCommander. He saw that the rebels had discovered our weak point,\r\nand that if they managed to establish themselves in our rear, our\r\ncommunication with the Punjab would be cut off, our small force would\r\nbe invested, and without supplies and reinforcements it would be\r\nimpossible to maintain our position against the daily increasing\r\nstrength of the insurgents. Great was the despondency in camp when\r\nthe result of the day's fighting was known; but the fine spirit which\r\nanimated the force throughout the siege soon asserted itself, and our\r\nmen cheerfully looked forward to the next encounter with the enemy.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak Grant was again upon the ground, but found it abandoned.\r\nMany dead men and horses were lying about, and a 9-pounder gun, left\r\nby the enemy, was brought into camp.\r\n\r\nThe troops had scarcely got back, hoping for a little rest, when the\r\nenemy again resumed their attack on the rear, and opened fire at so\r\nshort a distance that their shot came right through the camp. But on\r\nthis occasion they made no stand, and retreated as soon as our troops\r\nshowed themselves.\r\n\r\nIn order to strengthen our position in rear a battery of two\r\n18-pounders was constructed, supported by Cavalry and Infantry\r\npiquets, and most of the bridges over the drain from the Najafgarh\r\n_jhil_ were destroyed.\r\n\r\nFor two days after the events I have just described the hard-worked\r\nlittle body of troops had comparative rest, but our spies informed us\r\nthat the enemy were being largely reinforced, and that we might expect\r\nto be hotly attacked on the 23rd.\r\n\r\nFor some time an idea had been prevalent amongst the Natives that the\r\nEnglish _raj_ was not destined to survive its hundredth year, and that\r\nthe centenary of Clive's victory on the field of Plassy on the 23rd\r\nJune, 1757, would see its downfall. This idea was strengthened in\r\nthe Native mind by the fact that the 23rd June, 1857, was a date\r\npropitious alike for Hindus and Mahomedans; the Jattsa, a Hindu\r\nreligious festival, was to take place on that day, and there was also\r\nto be a new moon, which the Mahomedans looked upon as a lucky omen;\r\nthe astrologers, therefore, declared that the stars in their courses\r\nwould fight for the mutineers. If, however, prophecies and omens alike\r\nappeared to favour the rebels, fortune was not altogether unkind to\r\nus, for on the 22nd a reinforcement reached Rhai, twenty-two miles\r\nfrom Delhi, consisting of six Horse Artillery guns, a small party\r\nof British Infantry, a squadron of the 2nd Punjab Cavalry, and the\r\nHead-Quarters of the 4th Sikhs, numbering in all about 850 men.\r\n\r\nA staff officer was sent at once to Rhai to hurry on the force and\r\ntell them how urgently their assistance was required in camp; this\r\nappeal was responded to with the utmost alacrity, and early the next\r\nevening the welcome reinforcement made its appearance.\r\n\r\nIt had scarcely arrived before the Artillery on the city walls opened\r\nfire, while guns, which had been brought into the suburbs, enfiladed\r\nour right and concentrated a heavy fire on Hindu Rao's house which the\r\nfew guns we had in position were quite unable to silence. The rebel\r\nInfantry occupied Kishenganj and Sabzi Mandi in force, and threatened\r\nto advance on the Mound battery, while a constant musketry fire was\r\nmaintained upon the Ridge. Reid reported that the mutineers made a\r\ndesperate attack at about twelve o'clock, and that no men could have\r\nfought better; they charged the Rifles, the Guides, and the Gurkhas\r\nagain and again. The cannonade raged fast and furious, and at one\r\ntime it seemed as though the day must be lost. Thousands were brought\r\nagainst a mere handful of men; but Reid knew the importance of\r\nhis position, and was determined at all hazards to hold it until\r\nreinforcements arrived.[18]\r\n\r\nThe mutineers were checked, but not driven off. The first attempt from\r\nthe Mound battery failed to repulse them, and Colonel Welchman, who\r\nwas in command, was dangerously wounded. Every available man in camp\r\nhad been engaged, and as a last resource the 2nd Fusiliers and the 4th\r\nSikhs, who had just arrived from Rhai, were sent to the front. Showers\r\nwas placed in command, and shortly before the day closed he succeeded\r\nin forcing the enemy to retire. So the anniversary of Plassy saw us,\r\nthough hardly pressed, undefeated, and the enemy's hopes unfulfilled.\r\nThey lost over 1,000 men. Our casualties were 1 officer and 38 men\r\nkilled, and 3 officers and 118 men wounded. The heat all the while was\r\nterrific, and several of our men were knocked over by the sun.\r\n\r\nThe lesson taught us by this severe fighting was the importance\r\nof occupying the Sabzi Mandi, and thus preventing the enemy from\r\napproaching too close to the camp and enfilading the Ridge. This\r\nentailed more constant duty upon our already overworked soldiers, but\r\nBarnard felt that it would not do to run the risk of another such\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\nA piquet of 180 Europeans was accordingly placed in the Sabzi Mandi,\r\npart in a serai on one side of the Grand Trunk Road, and the rest in\r\na Hindu temple on the opposite side. These posts were connected by a\r\nline of breastworks with the Hindu Rao piquets, and added considerably\r\nto the strength of our position.\r\n\r\nAfter the 23rd there were real or threatened attacks daily; but we\r\nwere left fairly undisturbed until the 27th June, when the Metcalfe\r\nand Sabzi Mandi piquets were assaulted, and also the batteries on the\r\nRidge. These attempts were defeated without any very great loss, only\r\n13 of our men being killed, and 1 officer and 48 men wounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The late Major-General Sir Harry Tombs, V.C., K.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The Chaplain's Narrative of the siege of Delhi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Now the 1st Battalion, 2nd Gurkhas.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: 'Siege of Delhi; by an Officer who served there.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The late General Sir Hope Grant, G.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: 75th and 1st Bengal Fusiliers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: 1st Battalion 60th Rifles, 2nd Bengal Fusiliers, and\r\nSirmur battalion.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Swampy ground.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: 'The Indian Mutiny,' by George W.

The curtain\r\nconsisted of a simple masonry wall or rampart 16 feet in height, 11\r\nfeet thick at top, and 14 or 15 feet at bottom. This main wall carried\r\na parapet loopholed for musketry 8 feet in height and 3 feet in\r\nthickness. The whole of the land front was covered by a faussebraye of\r\nvarying thickness, ranging from 16 to 30 feet, and having a vertical\r\nscarp wall 8 feet high; exterior to this was a dry ditch about 25\r\nfeet in width. The counterscarp was simply an earthen slope, easy to\r\ndescend. The glacis was very narrow, extending only 50 or 60 yards\r\nfrom the counterscarp, and covering barely one-half of the walls\r\nfrom the besiegers' view. These walls were about seven miles in\r\ncircumference, and included an area of about three square miles (see\r\nColonel Baird-Smith's report, dated September 17, 1857).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: The late Field Marshal Lord Napier of Magdala, G.C.B.,\r\nG.C.S.I.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: So badly off were we for ammunition for the heavy guns\r\nat this time, that it was found necessary to use the shot fired at\r\nus by the enemy, and a reward was offered for every 24-pounder shot\r\nbrought into the Artillery Park.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Now General Sir Charles Reid, G.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Forrest's 'Indian Mutiny' and Norman's 'Narrative of the\r\nSiege of Delhi,' two interesting accounts from which I shall often\r\nquote.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: A Mahomedan place of worship and sacrifice.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: 'Siege of Delhi; by an Officer who served there.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Forrest's 'The Indian Mutiny.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Reid's own report.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n1857\r\n\r\n  A new appointment\r\n\r\n\r\nI will now continue my story from the 29th June, the morning after my\r\narrival in camp, when I awoke full of excitement, and so eager to hear\r\nall my old friend Norman could tell me, that I am afraid he must have\r\nbeen considerably bored with my questions.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for me to describe my pleasure at finding myself a\r\nmember of a force which had already gained imperishable fame. I longed\r\nto meet and know the men whose names were in everyone's mouth. The\r\nhero of the day was Harry Tombs, of the Bengal Horse Artillery, an\r\nunusually handsome man and a thorough soldier. His gallantry in the\r\nattack on the Idgah, and wherever he had been engaged, was the general\r\ntalk of the camp. I had always heard of Tombs as one of the best\r\nofficers in the regiment, and it was with feelings of respectful\r\nadmiration that I made his acquaintance a few days later.\r\n\r\nJemmy Hills,[1] one of the subalterns in Tombs's troop, was an old\r\nAddiscombe friend of mine; he delighted in talking of his Commander,\r\nin dilating on his merits as a soldier and his skill in handling\r\neach arm of the service. As a cool, bold leader of men Tombs was\r\nunsurpassed: no fire, however hot, and no crisis, however unexpected,\r\ncould take him by surprise; he grasped the situation in a moment,\r\nand issued his orders without hesitation, inspiring all ranks with\r\nconfidence in his power and capacity. He was somewhat of a martinet,\r\nand was more feared than liked by his men until they realized what a\r\ngrand leader he was, when they gave him their entire confidence, and\r\nwere ready to follow him anywhere and everywhere.\r\n\r\nAnother very distinguished officer of my regiment, whom I now met for\r\nthe first time, and for whom I ever afterwards entertained the warmest\r\nregard, was Edwin Johnson,[2] Assistant-Adjutant-General of the Bengal\r\nArtillery, in which capacity he had accompanied Brigadier Wilson from\r\nMeerut. He had a peculiarly bright intellect--somewhat caustic,\r\nbut always clever and amusing. He was a delightful companion, and\r\ninvariably gained the confidence of those with whom he worked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIEUTENANT-GENERAL SIR JAMES HILLS-JOHNES, V.C., G.C.B.\r\n_from a photograph by Messrs. Bourne and Shepherd._]\r\n\r\nJohnson was the first person on whom I called to report my arrival and\r\nto find out with which troop or battery I was to do duty. He told me\r\nthat the Quartermaster-General wished to keep me in his department.\r\nSo, after visiting General Chamberlain,[3] who I knew would be anxious\r\nto hear all that had been going on in the Movable Column since his\r\ndeparture, I made my way to Colonel Becher, whom I found suffering\r\nfrom the severe wound he had received a few days before, and asked him\r\nwhat was to be my fate. He replied that the question had been raised\r\nof appointing an officer to help the Assistant-Adjutant-General of\r\nthe Delhi Field Force, who found it impossible to carry on the daily\r\nincreasing work single-handed, and that Chamberlain had thought of me\r\nfor this post. Had Chamberlain's wish been carried out my career might\r\nhave been quite changed, but while he was discussing the question with\r\nSir Henry Barnard, Donald Stewart unexpectedly arrived in camp.\r\n\r\nI was waiting outside Sir Henry Barnard's tent, anxious to hear what\r\ndecision had been come to, when two men rode up, both looking greatly\r\nfatigued and half starved; one of them being Stewart. He told me\r\nthey had had a most adventurous ride; but before waiting to hear his\r\nstory,[4] I asked Norman to suggest Stewart for the new appointment--a\r\ncase of one word for Stewart and two for myself, I am afraid, for\r\nI had set my heart on returning to the Quartermaster-General's\r\ndepartment. And so it was settled, to our mutual satisfaction, Stewart\r\nbecoming the D.A.A.G. of the Delhi Field Force, and I the D.A.Q.M.G.\r\nwith the Artillery.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Now Lieutenant-General Sir James Hills-Johnes, V.C.,\r\nG.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The late General Sir Edwin Johnson, G.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Chamberlain had been given the rank of Brigadier-General\r\non his arrival at Delhi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The account of this adventurous ride is given in the\r\nAppendix.

When he took over\r\nthe command, he wrote, he was expected to be able to silence at once\r\nthe fire from the Mori and Kashmir bastions, and then to bring his\r\nheavy guns into play on the walls and open a way into the city,\r\nafter which, it was supposed, all would be plain sailing. But this\r\nprogramme, so plausible in theory, was absolutely impossible to put\r\ninto practice. In spite of every effort on our part, not a single one\r\nof the enemy's guns was silenced; they had four to our one, while the\r\ndistance from the Ridge to the city walls was too great to allow of\r\nour comparatively light guns making any impression on them. Under\r\nthese circumstances the only thing to be done was to construct\r\nbatteries nearer to the city, but before these could be begun,\r\nentrenching tools, sandbags, and other necessary materials, of which\r\nthe Engineers were almost entirely destitute, had to be collected. The\r\ntroops were being worn out by constant sanguinary combats, and the\r\nattacks to which they were exposed required every soul in camp to\r\nrepel them. It was never certain where the enemy intended to strike,\r\nand it was only by the most constant vigilance that their intentions\r\ncould be ascertained, and the men were being incessantly withdrawn\r\nduring the scorching heat of the day from one place to another.\r\nGeneral Barnard concluded as follows: 'You may ask why we engage in\r\nthese constant combats. The reason simply is that when attacked we\r\nmust defend ourselves, and that to secure our camp, our hospitals, our\r\nstores, etc., every living being has to be employed. The whole thing\r\nis too gigantic for the force brought against it.'\r\n\r\nSoon after Barnard wrote these lines reinforcements began to arrive,\r\nand our position was gradually improved. By the 3rd July the following\r\ntroops had reached Delhi: four Horse Artillery guns (two British\r\nand two Native), a detachment of European Foot Artillery, the\r\nHead-Quarters of Her Majesty's 8th and 61st Foot, one squadron of the\r\n5th Punjab Cavalry, the 1st Punjab Infantry, and some newly-raised\r\nSikh Sappers and Artillery. The strength of the force was thus\r\nincreased to nearly 6,600 men of all arms. The enemy's reinforcements,\r\nhowever, were out of all proportion to ours--mutineers from Jullundur,\r\nNasirabad, Nimach, Kotah, Gwalior, Jhansi, and Rohilkand arrived about\r\nthis time. Those from Rohilkand crossed by the bridge of boats and\r\nentered the city by the Calcutta gate; we could distinctly see them\r\nfrom the Ridge, marching in perfect formation, with their bands\r\nplaying and colours flying. Indeed, throughout the siege the enemy's\r\nnumbers were constantly being increased, while they had a practically\r\nunlimited number of guns, and the well-stocked magazine furnished them\r\nwith an inexhaustible supply of ammunition.\r\n\r\nI found myself under fire for the first time on the 30th June, when an\r\nattack was made on the Sabzi Mandi piquet and Hindu Rao's house. Eight\r\nof our men were killed and thirty wounded; amongst the latter were\r\nYorke and Packe, both attached to the 4th Sikhs. It appeared certain\r\nthat these two officers were wounded by the Hindustanis of their own\r\nregiment; Packe, who was shot through the ankle, being so close up to\r\nthe breastwork that it was scarcely possible for the bullet which hit\r\nhim to have come from the front. Consequently all the Hindustanis\r\nin the 4th Sikhs were disarmed and turned out of camp, as it was\r\nmanifestly undesirable to have any but the most loyal soldiers in our\r\nranks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIELD-MARSHAL SIR DONALD MARTIN STEWART, BART., G.C.B.,\r\nG.C.S.I., C.I.E.\r\n_From a photograph by Messrs. Elliott and Fry._]\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of the same day I was ordered to accompany a column\r\nunder Brigadier Showers, sent on reconnoitring duty towards the Idgah,\r\nwhere we heard that the enemy were again constructing a battery. It\r\nhad not been commenced, but the intention to build one was evident,\r\nfor we found a number of entrenching tools, and a quantity of\r\nsandbags.\r\n\r\nThe question of attempting to take the city by a _coup de main_ was\r\nnow again discussed. It was urged that our numbers, already small,\r\nwere being daily reduced by casualties and sickness; that the want of\r\nproper equipment rendered it impossible to undertake regular siege\r\noperations; and that a rising in the Punjab was imminent. The chances\r\nof success were certainly more favourable than they were on the 13th\r\nJune. The force to be employed was stronger; all concerned--the staff,\r\ncommanders, and troops--were fully apprised of what was intended, and\r\nof the part they would have to play; above all, the details of the\r\nscheme, which was drawn up on much the same lines as the former one,\r\nwere carefully worked out by Lieutenant Alex. Taylor,[2] who had\r\nrecently come into camp, and was acting temporarily as Commanding\r\nEngineer.\r\n\r\nOf the supreme importance of regaining possession of Delhi there can\r\nbe no doubt whatever. But nevertheless the undertaking would, at that\r\ntime, have been a most desperate one, and only to be justified by\r\nthe critical position in which we were placed. In spite of the late\r\nreinforcements, we were a mere handful compared with the thousands\r\nwithin the walls. Success, therefore, depended on the completeness\r\nof the surprise; and, as we could make no movement without its being\r\nperceived by the enemy, surprise was impossible. Another strong reason\r\nagainst assaulting at that time was the doubtful attitude of some\r\nof the Hindustani Cavalry still with us; the whole of the effective\r\ntroops, too, would have to be employed, and the sick and wounded--a\r\nlarge number--left to the mercy of the Native followers.\r\n\r\nGeneral Barnard carefully weighed all the arguments for and against\r\nthe proposal, and at last reluctantly consented to the attack being\r\nmade, but the discovery of a conspiracy amongst the Natives in camp\r\ncaused it to be countermanded--a great disappointment to many, and\r\nthere was much cavilling and discontent on the part of some, who could\r\nnot have sufficiently appreciated the difficulties and risks of the\r\nundertaking, or the disastrous consequences of a repulse.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the day on which it had been arranged that the\r\nassault should be made, the staff at Delhi received a most valuable\r\naddition in the person of Lieutenant-Colonel Baird-Smith, of the\r\nBengal Engineers. Summoned from Rurki to take the place of the Chief\r\nEngineer, whose health had broken down, Baird-Smith was within sixty\r\nmiles of Delhi on the 2nd July, when news of the intended movement\r\nreached him. He started at once, and arrived in camp early on the 3rd,\r\nbut only to find that the assault had been postponed.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 3rd July the enemy came out in force (5,000\r\nor 6,000 strong with several guns), and occupied the suburbs to our\r\nright. The troops were turned out, but instead of attacking us and\r\nreturning to the city as usual when it became dark, the rebels moved\r\noff in the direction of Alipur, where we had an outpost, which was\r\nheld by Younghusband's squadron of the 5th Punjab Cavalry. They\r\nreached Alipur about midnight, and had they attacked the serai at once\r\nwith Infantry, Younghusband and his men could hardly have escaped, but\r\nfortunately they opened upon it with Artillery. This gave the sowars\r\ntime to mount and fall back on Rhai, the next post, ten miles to the\r\nrear, which was garrisoned by the friendly troops of the Jhind Raja.\r\nThe sound of the guns being heard in camp, a column under the command\r\nof Major Coke was got ready to pursue should the insurgents push up\r\nthe Trunk Road, or to cut them off should they try to make their way\r\nback to the city. Besides his own corps (the 1st Punjab Infantry),\r\nCoke was given a wing of the 61st Foot, six Horse and six Field\r\nArtillery guns, one squadron of the Carabineers, one squadron of the\r\n9th Lancers, and the Guides Cavalry; in all about 800 Infantry, 300\r\nCavalry, and 12 guns, and I was sent with him as staff officer.\r\n\r\nIt was generally believed that the enemy were on the look-out for\r\ntreasure coming from the Punjab, which was known to be under the\r\ncharge of a Native guard, and we quite expected to have a long chase\r\nafter them; we were, therefore, surprised to see them, as day broke,\r\ncrossing our front on their way back to Delhi.\r\n\r\nThe rebels were moving on fairly high ground, but between us and\r\nthem was a swamp rendered almost impassable by recent heavy rain. It\r\nextended a considerable distance on either side, and as there was\r\nno other way of getting at the rapidly retreating foe, it had to be\r\ncrossed. Our Artillery opened fire, and Coke advanced with the Cavalry\r\nand Infantry. The swamp proved to be very difficult; in it men and\r\nhorses floundered hopelessly, and before we were clear the enemy had\r\ngot away with their guns; they were obliged, however, to leave behind\r\nall the plunder taken from Alipur, and a considerable quantity\r\nof ammunition. My share of the loot was a nice-looking, white,\r\ncountry-bred pony, which I found tied to a tree. I promptly annexed\r\nit, glad to save my own horse, and I congratulated myself on having\r\nmade a most useful addition to my small stud. It did not, however,\r\nremain long in my possession, for a few days afterwards it was claimed\r\nby its rightful owner, Lieutenant Younghusband.\r\n\r\nThe heat was great, and as the soldiers were much distressed, having\r\nbeen under arms for ten hours, Coke halted the Infantry portion on the\r\nbanks of the Western Jumna Canal instead of returning direct to\r\ncamp. While we were enjoying a much-needed rest we were unexpectedly\r\nattacked by some fresh troops (including about 800 Cavalry) which had\r\nhurried out from the city. I was startled from a sound sleep by heavy\r\nfiring, and saw the enemy advancing within a few hundred yards of our\r\nhalting-place. Coke formed his Infantry along the bank of the canal,\r\nand sent a mounted officer to recall the Cavalry and Artillery.\r\nThe enemy came on very boldly at first, but the steady fire of our\r\nInfantry kept them at bay, and when the guns arrived we had no\r\ndifficulty in driving them off. They left 80 dead on the field; we had\r\non our side 3 killed and 23 wounded, besides losing several British\r\nsoldiers from sunstroke.\r\n\r\nMajor Coke was much grieved by the loss in this engagement of a Native\r\nfriend of his, a Chief of the Kohat border, by name Mir Mubarak Shah.\r\nHe was a grand specimen of a frontier Khan,[3] and on hearing that the\r\n1st Punjab Infantry was ordered to Delhi expressed his determination\r\nto accompany it. He got together a troop of eighty of his own\r\nfollowers, and leaving Kohat on the 1st June, overtook Coke at Kurnal\r\non the 27th, a distance of nearly 600 miles. A day or two afterwards\r\nCoke's men were approached by the Hindustanis of the 2nd Punjab\r\nCavalry, and some Native officers of the 9th Irregulars, who tried to\r\ninduce them to join in the rebellion. Advances were made in the first\r\ninstance to Mir Mubarak Shah and Mir Jaffir, the Subadar-Major of the\r\n1st Punjab Infantry, who at once informed Coke of what was going on.\r\nAs soon as the regiment reached Delhi the matter was investigated, and\r\nthe Native officers who had endeavoured to tamper with the men were\r\nidentified, tried, and executed.\r\n\r\nAbout noon on the 5th July we heard the woeful tidings that General\r\nBarnard was seized with cholera. The army had never been free from\r\nthat terrible scourge since the Commander-in-Chief fell a victim to\r\nit on the 26th May, and now it had attacked his successor, who was\r\ncarried off after a few hours' illness. The feeling of sadness amongst\r\nthe troops at the loss of their General was universal. Throughout the\r\nsix trying weeks he had been in command of the force he had never\r\nspared himself. At work from morning till night in and about the\r\ntrenches, he personally attended to every detail, and had won the\r\nrespect and regard of all in camp.\r\n\r\nFew Commanders were ever placed in a more difficult position than\r\nBarnard. He arrived at Umballa when the Native troops, to whose\r\ncharacteristics and peculiarities (as I have already remarked) he was\r\na complete stranger, were thoroughly disaffected, and within a week of\r\nhis taking over the command of the Sirhind division the Mutiny broke\r\nout. Without any previous knowledge of Indian warfare, he found\r\nhimself in front of Delhi with a force altogether too weak to effect\r\nthe object for which it was intended and without any of the appliances\r\nto ensure success; while those who did not realize the extreme risk\r\ninvolved never ceased clamouring at a delay which was unavoidable, and\r\nurging the General to undertake a task which was impossible.\r\n\r\nBarnard has been blamed, and not unjustly, for mistrusting his own\r\njudgment and for depending upon others for advice about matters on\r\nwhich an experienced Commander ought to have been the best able to\r\ndecide. But every allowance must be made for the position he was\r\nso unexpectedly called upon to fill and the peculiar nature of his\r\nsurroundings. Failing health, too, probably weakened the self-reliance\r\nwhich a man who had satisfactorily performed the duties of Chief of\r\nthe Staff in the Crimea must at one time have possessed.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Sir Henry Barnard, General Reed assumed command. He\r\nhad joined the force on the morning of the action of Badli-ki-Serai,\r\nbut though senior to Barnard, he was too much knocked up by the\r\nintense heat of the long journey from Peshawar to take part in the\r\naction, and he had allowed Barnard to continue in command.\r\n\r\nFor the next few days we had a comparatively quiet time, of which\r\nadvantage was taken to render our position more secure towards the\r\nrear. The secrecy and rapidity with which the enemy had made their way\r\nto Alipur warned the authorities how easily our communication with the\r\nPunjab might be cut off. Baird-Smith saw the necessity for remedying\r\nthis, and, acting on his advice, Reed had all the bridges over the\r\nWestern Jumna Canal destroyed for several miles, except one required\r\nfor our own use. The Phulchudder aqueduct, which carried the canal\r\nwater into the city, and along which horsemen could pass to the rear\r\nof our camp, was blown up, as was also the Bussye bridge over the\r\ndrain from the Najafgarh _jhil_, about eight miles from camp.\r\n\r\nWe were not left long in peace, for on the morning of the 9th July the\r\nenemy moved out of the city in great force, and for several hours kept\r\nup an incessant cannonade on our front and right flank.\r\n\r\nThe piquet below the General's Mound happened to be held this day by\r\ntwo guns of Tombs's troop, commanded by Second Lieutenant James Hills,\r\nand by thirty men of the Carabineers under Lieutenant Stillman. A\r\nlittle beyond, and to the right of this piquet, a Native officer's\r\nparty of the 9th Irregular Cavalry had been placed to watch the Trunk\r\nRoad. These men were still supposed to be loyal; the regiment to which\r\nthey belonged had a good reputation, and as Christie's Horse had\r\ndone excellent service in Afghanistan, where Neville and Crawford\r\nChamberlain had served with it as subalterns. It was, therefore,\r\nbelieved at the Mound piquet that ample warning would be given of\r\nany enemy coming from the direction of the Trunk Road, so that the\r\napproach of some horsemen dressed like the men of the 9th Irregulars\r\nattracted little notice.\r\n\r\nStillman and Hills were breakfasting together, when a sowar from the\r\nNative officers' party rode up and reported that a body of the enemy's\r\nCavalry were in sight. Hills told the man to gallop to Head-Quarters\r\nwith the report, and to warn Tombs as he passed his tent. Hills and\r\nStillman then mounted their men, neither of them having the remotest\r\nidea that the news of the enemy's advance had been purposely delayed\r\nuntil there was not time to turn out the troops. They imagined that\r\nthe sowar was acting in good faith and had given them sufficient\r\nnotice, and while Hills moved his guns towards the position from which\r\nhe could command the Trunk Road, Stillman proceeded to the top of the\r\nMound in order to get a better view of the ground over which the enemy\r\nwere said to be advancing. The troop of the Carabineers was thus left\r\nby itself to receive the first rush of the rebel Cavalry; it was\r\ncomposed of young soldiers, some of them quite untrained, who turned\r\nand broke.\r\n\r\nThe moment Hills saw the enemy he shouted, 'Action front!' and, in\r\nthe hope of giving his men time to load and fire a round of grape, he\r\ngallantly charged the head of the column single-handed, cut down the\r\nleading man, struck the second, and then was then ridden down himself.\r\nIt had been raining heavily, so Hills wore his cloak; which probably\r\nsaved his life, for it was cut through in many places, as were his\r\njacket and even his shirt.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the body of the enemy had passed on, Hills, extricating\r\nhimself from his horse, got up and searched for his sword, which he\r\nhad lost in the mêlée. He had just found it when he was attacked by\r\nthree men, two of whom were mounted; he fired at and wounded the first\r\nman; then caught the lance of the second in his left hand, and ran him\r\nthrough the body with his sword. The first assailant coming on again,\r\nHills cut him down, upon which he was attacked by the third man on\r\nfoot, who succeeded in wrenching his sword from him. Hills fell in\r\nthe struggle, and must have been killed, if Tombs, who had been duly\r\nwarned by the sowar, and had hurried out to the piquet, had not come\r\nto the rescue and saved his plucky subaltern's life.[4]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Hills's gallant attempt to stop the sowars, his men\r\nhad not time to fire a single round before they were upon them. Their\r\nobject, however, was not to capture these two guns, but to induce the\r\nNative Horse Artillery to join them, and galloping past the piquet,\r\nthey made straight for the troop, and called upon the men to bring\r\naway their guns. The Native Artillerymen behaved admirably: they not\r\nonly refused to respond to the call, but they begged the men of the\r\nEuropean troop, which was unlimbered close by, to fire through them on\r\nthe mutineers.\r\n\r\nKnowing nothing of what was happening, I was standing by my tent,\r\nwatching my horses, which had just arrived from Philour, as they\r\ncrossed the bridge over the canal cut which ran at the rear of our\r\ncamp, when the enemy's Cavalry galloped over the bridge, and for a few\r\nmoments my animals seemed in considerable danger; the sowars, however,\r\nhaving lost more than one-third of their number, and having failed in\r\ntheir attempt to get hold of the Native Horse Artillery guns, were\r\nbent upon securing their retreat rather than upon plunder. My\r\nservants gave a wonderful account of the many perils they had\r\nencountered--somewhat exaggerated, I dare say--but they had done me a\r\nreal good service, having marched 200 miles through a very disturbed\r\ncountry, and arriving with animals and baggage in good order. Indeed,\r\nthroughout the Mutiny my servants behaved admirably. The _khidmatgar_\r\n(table attendant) never failed to bring me my food under the hottest\r\nfire, and the _saices_ (grooms) were always present with the horses\r\nwhenever they were required, apparently quite indifferent to the risks\r\nthey often ran. Moreover, they became imbued with such a warlike\r\nspirit that, when I was invalided in April, 1858, four of them\r\nenlisted in a regiment of Bengal Cavalry. The _khidmatgar_ died soon\r\nafter the Mutiny, but two of his brothers were afterwards in my\r\nservice; one, who was with me during the Lushai expedition and the\r\nwhole of the Afghan war, never left me for more than twenty years, and\r\nwe parted with mutual regret at Bombay on board the P. and O. steamer\r\nin which I took my final departure from India in April, 1893.\r\n\r\nMine was not a solitary instance; not only the officers' servants,\r\nbut the followers belonging to European regiments, such as cook-boys,\r\n_saices_ and _bhisties_ (water-carriers), as a rule, behaved in the\r\nmost praiseworthy manner, faithful and brave to a degree. So much was\r\nthis the case, that when the troopers of the 9th Lancers were called\r\nupon to name the man they considered most worthy of the Victoria\r\nCross, an honour which Sir Colin Campbell purposed to confer upon the\r\nregiment to mark his appreciation of the gallantry displayed by all\r\nranks during the campaign, they unanimously chose the head _bhistie_!\r\nConsidering the peculiar position we were in at the time, it is\r\nsomewhat remarkable that the conduct of the Native servants should\r\nhave been so generally satisfactory. It speaks as well, I think, for\r\nthe masters as the servants, and proves (what I have sometimes heard\r\ndenied) that Native servants are, as a rule, kindly and considerately\r\ntreated by their European masters.\r\n\r\nTo return to my story. The cannonade from within and without the city\r\ncontinued unceasing, and the enemy had again to be driven out of the\r\nnear suburbs. This duty was entrusted to General Chamberlain, whom\r\nI accompanied as one of his staff officers. His column consisted of\r\nabout 800 Infantry and six guns, a few more men joining us as we\r\npassed the Ridge. This was the first occasion on which I had witnessed\r\nfighting in gardens and walled enclosures, and I realized how\r\ndifficult it was to dislodge men who knew how to take advantage of the\r\ncover thus afforded. Our soldiers, as usual, fought well against very\r\nheavy odds, and before we were able to force the enemy back into the\r\ncity we had lost 1 officer and 40 men killed, and 8 officers and 163\r\nmen wounded, besides 11 poor fellows missing: every one of whom\r\nmust have been murdered. The enemy had nearly 500 men killed, and\r\nconsiderably more than that number wounded.\r\n\r\nThe result of the day's experience was so far satisfactory that it\r\ndetermined General Reed to get rid of all the Hindustani soldiers\r\nstill remaining in camp. It was clear that the Native officers' party\r\nnear the Mound piquet had been treacherous; none of them were ever\r\nseen again, and it was generally believed that they had joined the\r\nenemy in their dash through the camp. The other Native soldiers did\r\nnot hesitate to denounce their Hindustani comrades as traitors; the\r\nlatter were consequently all sent away, except a few men of the 4th\r\nIrregular Cavalry who were deprived of their horses and employed\r\nsolely as orderlies. It was also thought advisable to take the guns\r\nfrom the Native troop of Horse Artillery. A few of the younger men\r\nbelonging to it deserted, but the older soldiers continued faithful,\r\nand did good work in the breaching batteries.\r\n\r\nThere was a short lull after our fight on the 9th--a sure sign that\r\nthe enemy's loss was heavier than they had calculated upon. When the\r\nmutineers received reinforcements we were certain to be attacked\r\nwithin a few hours, but if no fresh troops arrived on the scene we\r\ncould generally depend upon a day or two's respite.\r\n\r\nOur next fight was on the 14th July. The rebels came out on that\r\nmorning in great numbers, attacking Hindu Rao's house and the Sabzi\r\nMandi piquets, and supported by a continuous fire of Artillery from\r\nthe walls. For some hours we remained on the defensive, but as the\r\nenemy's numbers increased, and we were greatly harassed by their\r\nfire, a column was formed to dislodge them. It was of about the usual\r\nstrength, viz., 800 Infantry and six Horse Artillery guns, with the\r\naddition of a few of the Guides Cavalry and of Hodson's newly-raised\r\nHorse. The command was given to Brigadier Showers, and I was sent as\r\nhis staff officer; Reid joined in at the foot of the Ridge with all\r\nthe men that could be spared, and Brigadier-General Chamberlain also\r\naccompanied the column.\r\n\r\nWe moved on under a very heavy fire until we reached an enclosure the\r\nwall of which was lined with the enemy. The troops stopped short, when\r\nChamberlain, seeing that they hesitated, called upon them to follow\r\nhim, and gave them a splendid example by jumping his horse over the\r\nwall. The men did follow him, and Chamberlain got a ball in his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nWe had great difficulty in driving the enemy back; they contested\r\nevery inch of the ground, the many serais and walled gardens affording\r\nthem admirable cover; but our troops were not to be withstood;\r\nposition after position was carried until we found ourselves in sight\r\nof the Lahore gate and close up to the walls of the city. In our\r\neagerness to drive the enemy back we had, however, come too far. It\r\nwas impossible to remain where we were. Musketry from the walls and\r\ngrape from the heavy guns mounted on the Mori and other bastions\r\ncommitted terrible havoc. Men were falling on all sides, but the\r\ngetting back was hazardous to the last degree. Numerous as the enemy\r\nwere, they had not the courage to stand against us as long as we\r\nadvanced, but the first sign of retreat was the signal for them to\r\nleave their shelter and press us the whole way to camp.\r\n\r\nWhen the retirement commenced I was with the two advanced guns in\r\naction on the Grand Trunk Road. The subaltern in charge was severely\r\nwounded, and almost at the same moment one of his sergeants, a smart,\r\nhandsome fellow, fell, shot through the leg. Seeing some men carrying\r\nhim into a hut at the side of the road, I shouted: 'Don't put him\r\nthere; he will be left behind; get a doolie for him, or put him on the\r\nlimber.' But what with the incessant fire from the enemy's guns, the\r\nbursting of shells, the crashing of shot through the branches of the\r\ntrees, and all the din and hubbub of battle, I could not have been\r\nheard, for the poor fellow with another wounded man was left in the\r\nhut, and both were murdered by the mutineers. So many of the men with\r\nthe two guns were _hors de combat_, and the horses were so unsteady\r\n(several of them being wounded), that there was great difficulty in\r\nlimbering up, and I was helping the drivers to keep the horses quiet,\r\nwhen I suddenly felt a tremendous blow on my back which made me faint\r\nand sick, and I was afraid I should not be able to remain on my horse.\r\nThe powerless feeling, however, passed off, and I managed to stick\r\non until I got back to camp. I had been hit close to the spine by a\r\nbullet, and the wound would probably have been fatal but for the fact\r\nthat a leather pouch for caps, which I usually wore in front near\r\nmy pistol, had somehow slipped round to the back; the bullet passed\r\nthrough this before entering my body, and was thus prevented from\r\npenetrating very deep.\r\n\r\nThe enemy followed us closely right up to our piquets, and but for the\r\nsteadiness of the retirement our casualties must have been even more\r\nnumerous than they were. As it was, they amounted to 15 men killed, 16\r\nofficers and 177 men wounded, and 2 men missing.\r\n\r\nThe enemy's loss was estimated at 1,000. For hours they were seen\r\ncarrying the dead in carts back to the city.\r\n\r\nMy wound, though comparatively slight, kept me on the sick-list for a\r\nfortnight, and for more than a month I could not mount a horse or put\r\non a sword-belt. I was lucky in that my tent was pitched close to that\r\nof John Campbell Brown, one of the medical officers attached to the\r\nArtillery. He had served during the first Afghan war, with Sale's\r\nforce, at Jalalabad, and throughout both the campaigns in the Punjab,\r\nand had made a great reputation for himself as an army surgeon. He\r\nlooked after me while I was laid up, and I could not have been in\r\nbetter hands.\r\n\r\nThe Delhi Force was fortunate in its medical officers. Some of the\r\nbest in the army were attached to it, and all that was possible to be\r\ndone for the sick and wounded under the circumstances was done. But\r\nthe poor fellows had a bad time of it. A few of the worst cases were\r\naccommodated in the two or three houses in the cantonment that had\r\nescaped destruction, but the great majority had to put up with such\r\nshelter from the burning heat and drenching rain as an ordinary\r\nsoldiers' tent could provide. Those who could bear the journey and\r\nwere not likely to be fit for duty for some time were sent away to\r\nMeerut and Umballa; but even with the relief thus afforded, the\r\nhospitals throughout the siege were terribly overcrowded. Anæsthetics\r\nwere freely used, but antiseptics were practically unknown,\r\nconsequently many of the severely wounded died, and few amputation\r\ncases survived.\r\n\r\nA great aggravation to the misery and discomfort in hospital was the\r\nplague of flies. Delhi is at all times noted for having more than its\r\nshare of these drawbacks to life in the East, but during the siege\r\nthey were a perfect pest, and for the short time I was laid up I fully\r\nrealized the suffering which our sick and wounded soldiers had to\r\nendure. At night the inside of my tent was black with flies. At the\r\nfirst ray of light or the smallest shake to the ropes, they were all\r\nastir, and for the rest of the day there was no peace; it was even\r\ndifficult to eat without swallowing one or more of the loathsome\r\ninsects. I had to brush them away with one hand while I put the food\r\ninto my mouth with the other, and more than once I had to rush from\r\nthe table, a fly having eluded all my efforts to prevent his going\r\ndown my throat.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I could get about a little, but before I was able to\r\nperform my legitimate work, I was employed in helping to look after\r\nthe conservancy of the camp and its surroundings--an extremely\r\ndisagreeable but most important duty, for an Indian army must always\r\nhave a large following, for which sanitary arrangements are a\r\ndifficulty. Then, large convoys of camels and bullock-carts arrived\r\ndaily with supplies and stores, and a considerable number of transport\r\nanimals had to be kept in readiness to follow up the enemy with a\r\nsuitably sized force, whenever we could drive them out of the city.\r\nWithout any shelter, and often with insufficient food, deaths amongst\r\nthe animals were of constant occurrence, and, unless their carcases\r\ncould at once be removed, the stench became intolerable. Every\r\nexpedient was resorted to to get rid of this nuisance. Some of the\r\ncarcases were dragged to a distance from camp, some were buried, and\r\nsome were burnt, but, notwithstanding all our efforts, many remained\r\nto be gradually devoured by the jackals which prowled about the camp,\r\nand by the innumerable birds of prey which instinct had brought to\r\nDelhi from the remotest parts of India.[5]\r\n\r\nAt a time when the powers of each individual were taxed to the\r\nuttermost, the strain on the Commander of the force was terribly\r\nsevere. Mind and body were incessantly at work. Twice in the short\r\nspace of six weeks had the officer holding this responsible position\r\nsuccumbed, and now a third was on the point of breaking down.\r\nMajor-General Reed's health, never very strong, completely failed, and\r\non the 17th July, only twelve days after succeeding Sir Henry Barnard,\r\nhe had to give up the command and leave the camp on sick certificate.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Kaye's 'History of the Indian Mutiny.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Now General Sir Alexander Taylor, G.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Mahomedans of good family are so styled in northern\r\nIndia.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Tombs and Hills both received the Victoria Cross for\r\ntheir gallantry.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: 'Adjutants,' never seen in ordinary times further north\r\nthan Bengal, appeared in hundreds, and were really useful scavengers.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n1857\r\n\r\n  Archdale Wilson assumes command--Enemy baffled in the Sabzi Mandi\r\n  --Efforts to exterminate the Feringhis\r\n  --A letter from General Havelock--News of Henry Lawrence's death\r\n  --Arrival of the Movable Column--The 61st Foot at Najafgarh\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Reed was succeeded by Brigadier Archdale Wilson, the officer\r\nwho commanded the Meerut column at the beginning of the campaign, and\r\nwho was so successful in the fights on the Hindun. Though a soldier of\r\nmoderate capacity, Wilson was quite the best of the senior officers\r\npresent, three of whom were superseded by his selection. Two of these,\r\nCongreve, Acting-Adjutant-General of Queen's troops, and Graves, who\r\nhad been Brigadier at Delhi when the Mutiny broke out, left the camp\r\non being passed over; the third, Longfield, took Wilson's place as\r\nBrigadier.\r\n\r\nWilson's succession to the command gave great relief to the troops on\r\naccount of the systematic manner in which he arranged for the various\r\nduties, and the order and method he introduced. The comparative rest\r\nto the troops, as well as the sanitary improvements he effected, did a\r\ngood deal for the health of the force. Wilson also took advantage of\r\nthe reinforcements we had received to strengthen our position. As far\r\nas possible he put a stop to the practice of following up the enemy\r\nclose to the city walls when they were driven off after an attack (a\r\npractice which had cost us many valuable lives), contenting himself\r\nwith preventing the rebels from remaining in the immediate vicinity of\r\nour advanced posts.\r\n\r\nThe day after Reed's departure another sharp and prolonged attack was\r\nmade upon the Ridge batteries and Sabzi Mandi piquets, and in the\r\nafternoon a column was sent to drive the enemy away. It consisted\r\nof four Horse Artillery guns, 750 Infantry, and the Guides Cavalry.\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Jones, of the 60th Rifles, commanded the column,\r\nand, having gained experience from the lesson we had received on the\r\n14th, he took care not to approach too near to the city walls, but\r\ncleared the Sabzi Mandi, and took up a good position, where he\r\nremained for some little time. This unusual procedure seemed to\r\ndisconcert the enemy, most of whom returned to the city, while those\r\nwho remained to fight did not come to such close quarters as on\r\nprevious occasions. Nevertheless, we had 1 officer and 12 men killed,\r\n3 officers and 66 men wounded, and 2 men were missing.\r\n\r\nThe four following days passed without any serious attack being made,\r\nbut an unfortunate accident occurred about this time to a cousin of\r\nmine, Captain Greensill, of the 24th Foot. He was attached to the\r\nEngineer department, and was ordered to undertake some reconnoitring\r\nduty after dark. On nearing the enemy's position he halted his escort,\r\nin order not to attract attention, and proceeded alone to examine the\r\nground. The signal which he had arranged to give on his return was\r\napparently misunderstood, for as he approached the escort fired; he\r\nwas mortally wounded, and died in great agony the next morning.\r\n\r\nThe last severe contest took place in the Sabzi Mandi on the 18th,\r\nfor by this time the Engineers' incessant labour had resulted in the\r\nclearing away of the old serais and walled gardens for some distance\r\nround the posts held by our piquets in that suburb. The 'Sammy\r\nHouse' piquet, to the right front of Hindu Rao's house, was greatly\r\nstrengthened, and cover was provided for the men occupying it--a very\r\nnecessary measure, exposed as the piquet was to the guns on the Burn\r\nand Mori bastions, and within grape range of the latter, while the\r\nenemy's Infantry were enabled to creep close up to it unperceived.\r\n\r\nThe improvements we had made in this part of our position were, no\r\ndoubt, carefully watched and noted by the rebels, who, finding\r\nthat all attempts to dislodge us on the right ended in their own\r\ndiscomfiture, determined to try whether our left was not more\r\nvulnerable than they had found it in the earlier days of the siege.\r\nAccordingly early on the 23rd they sallied forth from the Kashmir\r\ngate, and, occupying Ludlow Castle and its neighbourhood, shelled\r\nMetcalfe House, the stable piquet, and the mosque piquet on the Ridge.\r\nAs all attempts to silence the enemy's guns with our Artillery proved\r\nunavailing, and it was feared that if not dislodged they would\r\nestablish a battery at Ludlow Castle, a small column under Brigadier\r\nShowers moved out by a cutting through the Ridge on our left, its\r\nobject being (in conjunction with the Metcalfe House piquets) to turn\r\nthe enemy's right and capture their guns.\r\n\r\nThe troops detailed for this duty consisted of six Horse Artillery\r\nguns, 400 British Infantry, 360 of the 1st Punjab Infantry, and a\r\nparty of the Guides Cavalry, in addition to 250 men detached from the\r\nMetcalfe House piquets. The advance of the column up the road leading\r\ntowards the Kashmir gate appeared to be unnoticed until it arrived\r\nclose to the enemy, who then opened with grape. Our troops pressed\r\non, and in their eagerness to capture the guns, which were being\r\nwithdrawn, got too near the city walls. Here Showers was wounded, and\r\nthe command devolved on Lieutenant-Colonel Jones, of the 60th, who\r\nskilfully conducted the retirement. Our loss was 1 officer and 11 men\r\nkilled, 5 officers and 34 men wounded. Captain Law, one of my two\r\ncompanions on the mail-cart from Umballa, was the officer killed.\r\n\r\nThe enemy were fairly quiet between the 23rd and 31st July, on which\r\ndate they moved out of the city in considerable strength, with the\r\nintention of making a temporary bridge across the cut in the swampy\r\nground I have before described, and so threatening our rear. A column\r\nunder Coke was sent to the other side of the cut to intercept the\r\nenemy should they succeed in getting across; this column was joined\r\nat Alipur by the Kumaon battalion (composed of Gurkhas and hill-men),\r\nabout 400 strong, which had just arrived from the Punjab as escort\r\nto a large store of ammunition. The services of these troops were,\r\nhowever, not required, for the rain, which had been coming down in\r\ntorrents for some hours, had caused such a rush of water that the\r\nbridge was carried away before it was completed. The enemy then\r\nretired towards the city. On reaching the suburbs they were reinforced\r\nby a large body of Infantry, and a most determined attack was made on\r\nthe right of our position. This occurred about sunset, and all night\r\nthe roar of musketry and artillery was kept up without a moment's\r\ncessation.\r\n\r\nThe next day was the anniversary of a great Mahomedan festival, when\r\nit was the custom for the King to pray and make sacrifice at the\r\nIdgah, in commemoration of Abraham's intended offering up of\r\nIshmail.[1] On this particular occasion, however, the sacrifices were\r\nto be dispensed with in deference to Hindu prejudices,[2] and in\r\ntheir stead a tremendous united effort was to be made by Hindus and\r\nMussulmans to exterminate the Feringhis. All the morning of the\r\n1st August mosques and Hindu temples were crowded with worshippers\r\noffering up prayers for the success of the great attempt, and in the\r\nafternoon the rebels, mad with excitement and fanaticism, issued\r\nin countless numbers from the city gates, and, shouting the Moslem\r\nbattle-cry, advanced and threw themselves on our defences. They were\r\ndriven back by our deadly volleys, but only for a moment; they quickly\r\nreformed and made a fresh attack, to be stopped again by our steady,\r\nuncompromising fire. Time after time they rallied and hurled\r\nthemselves against our breastworks. All that night and well on into\r\nthe next day the fight continued, and it was past noon before the\r\ndevoted fanatics became convinced that their gods had deserted them,\r\nthat victory was not for them, and that no effort, however heroic on\r\ntheir part, could drive us from the Ridge. The enemy's loss was heavy,\r\nours trifling, for our men were admirably steady, well protected by\r\nbreastworks, and never allowed to show themselves except when the\r\nassailants came close up. We had only 1 officer and 9 men killed and\r\n36 men wounded.\r\n\r\nThe officer was Lieutenant Eaton Travers, of the 1st Punjab Infantry.\r\nHe had been seven years with the regiment, and had been present\r\nwith it in nearly all the many frontier fights in which it had been\r\nengaged. He was a bright, happy fellow, and a great friend of mine. As\r\nMajor Coke, his commanding officer, published in regimental orders:\r\n'This gallant soldier and true-hearted gentleman was beloved and\r\nrespected by the officers and men of the regiment. His loss is an\r\nirreparable one.'\r\n\r\nThe enemy were much depressed by the failure of the Bakhra Id attack,\r\nfrom which they had expected great things. They began to despair of\r\nbeing able to drive us from our position on the Ridge, which for seven\r\nweeks had been so hotly contested. They heard that Nicholson with his\r\nMovable Column was hastening to our assistance, and they felt that,\r\nunless they could gain some signal victory before reinforcements\r\nreached us, we should take our place as the besiegers, instead of\r\nbeing, as hitherto, the besieged. Disaffection within the city walls\r\nwas on the increase; only the semblance of authority remained to the\r\nold and well-nigh impotent King, while some of his sons, recognizing\r\ntheir perilous position, endeavoured to open negotiations with us.\r\nMany of the sepoys were reported to be going off to their homes, sick\r\nand weary of a struggle the hopelessness of which they had begun to\r\nrealize.\r\n\r\nOur work, however, was far from being finished. Notwithstanding losses\r\nfrom death and desertion, the enemy still outnumbered us by about\r\neight or nine to one.\r\n\r\nAll this time our communication with the Punjab was maintained, and we\r\nregularly received letters and newspapers from England by the northern\r\nroute; but for several weeks we had had no news from the south.\r\nRumours of disasters occasionally reached us, but it was not until the\r\nsecond week in July that we heard of the fight at Agra, the retirement\r\nof our troops, and the flight of all the residents into the fort.\r\n\r\nThese scraps of intelligence, for they were mere scraps, written often\r\nin Greek character, some screwed into a quill, some sewn between the\r\ndouble soles of a man's shoe, and some twisted up in the messenger's\r\nhair, were eagerly looked for, and as eagerly deciphered when they\r\ncame. It was cheering to learn that Allahabad was safe, that Lucknow\r\nwas still holding out, that troops from Madras, Ceylon, and the\r\nMauritius had reached Calcutta, and that Lord Elgin, taking a\r\nstatesmanlike view of the situation, had diverted to India[3] the\r\nforce intended for the China expedition, and we fondly hoped that some\r\nof the six British regiments reported by one messenger to have arrived\r\nat Cawnpore would be sent to the assistance of the Delhi Force.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, we knew nothing of the death of Sir Henry Lawrence\r\nor General Wheeler, and had not even heard for certain that Cawnpore\r\nhad fallen and that Lucknow was besieged, while there were constant\r\nreports that Wheeler was marching up the Trunk Road. Being most\r\nanxious to get some authentic intelligence, Norman[4] on the 15th July\r\nwrote a letter in French addressed to General Wheeler at Cawnpore, or\r\nwhoever might be in command between that place and Delhi, giving an\r\naccount of our position at Delhi, and expressing a hope that troops\r\nwould soon march to our assistance. The letter was entrusted to two\r\nsepoys of the Guides, who carried out their difficult task most\r\nfaithfully, and on the 3rd August returned with the following reply\r\nfrom General Havelock, addressed to Major-General Reed:\r\n\r\n    'Cawnpore, left bank of the Ganges,\r\n    '_25th July, 1857._\r\n\r\n    'MY DEAR GENERAL,\r\n\r\n    'Yesterday I saw Captain Norman's letter of the 15th instant from\r\n    Delhi, addressed to Sir Hugh Wheeler. That gallant officer and the\r\n    whole of his force were destroyed on the 27th June by a base act\r\n    of treachery. Sir Henry Somerset is Commander-in-Chief in India\r\n    and Sir Patrick Grant in Bengal. Under the orders of the supreme\r\n    Government I have been sent to retrieve affairs here. I have\r\n    specific instructions from which I cannot depart. I have sent a\r\n    duplicate of your letter to Sir P. Grant. In truth, though most\r\n    anxious to march on Delhi, I have peremptory orders to relieve\r\n    Lucknow. I have, thank God, been very successful. I defeated the\r\n    enemy at Futtehpore on the 12th, and Pandu Naddi on the 15th, and\r\n    this place, which I recaptured on the 16th. On each occasion I\r\n    took all the guns. Immense reinforcements are coming from England\r\n    and China. Sir Patrick Grant will soon be in the field himself.\r\n    Lucknow holds out. Agra is free for the present. I am sorry to\r\n    hear you are not quite well. I beg that you will let me hear from\r\n    you continually.'\r\n\r\nTwo days afterwards another letter was received; this time from\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Fraser-Tytler, A.Q.M.G., with Havelock's force. It\r\nwas addressed to Captain Earle, A.Q.M.G., Meerut, and ran as follows:\r\n\r\n    'Cawnpore, _July 27th_.\r\n\r\n    'General Havelock has crossed the river to relieve Lucknow, which\r\n    will be effected four days hence. He has a strong force with him,\r\n    and he has already thrashed the Nana and completely dispersed his\r\n    force. We shall probably march to Delhi with four or five thousand\r\n    Europeans and a heavy Artillery, in number, not in weight. The\r\n    China force is in Calcutta, 5,000 men. More troops expected\r\n    immediately. We shall soon be with you.'\r\n\r\nThese sanguine expectations were never fulfilled! Instead of Lucknow\r\nbeing relieved in four days, it was nearly four months before that\r\nresult was achieved, and instead of troops from Cawnpore coming to\r\nhelp us at Delhi, the troops from Delhi formed the chief part of the\r\nforce which relieved Lucknow.\r\n\r\nWhile we were rejoicing at the prospect of being reinforced by a large\r\nnumber of British soldiers, a gloom was cast over the whole camp by\r\nthe rumour that Sir Henry Lawrence was dead. As the first British\r\nRuler of the Punjab, Henry Lawrence was known by reputation to, and\r\nrespected by, every man belonging to the Delhi Force, and all realized\r\nwhat a serious loss his death would be to the beleaguered garrison of\r\nLucknow. Much time, however, was not given us for lamentation, for at\r\nthe end of the first week in August another attempt was made to drive\r\nus from the Metcalfe House piquets. Guns were again brought out\r\nthrough the Kashmir gate, and posted at Ludlow Castle and the\r\nKudsiabagh; at the same time a number of Infantry skirmishers kept up\r\nan almost constant fire from the jungle in front of our position. The\r\nlosses at the piquets themselves were not heavy, good cover having\r\nbeen provided; but the communications between the piquets and our main\r\nposition were much exposed and extremely hazardous for the reliefs. It\r\nwas felt that the enemy could not be allowed to remain in such close\r\nproximity to our outposts, and Showers (who had recovered from his\r\nslight wound) was again ordered to drive them off, for which purpose\r\nhe was given a strong body of Infantry, composed of Europeans, Sikhs,\r\nand Gurkhas, a troop of Horse Artillery, a squadron of the 9th\r\nLancers, and the Guides Cavalry. The result was a very brilliant\r\nlittle affair. The orders on this occasion were to 'move up silently\r\nand take the guns at Ludlow Castle.' The small column proceeded in the\r\ndeepest silence, and the first sound heard at dawn on the 12th August\r\nwas the challenge of the enemy's sentry, '_Ho come dar?_' (Who comes\r\nthere?). A bullet in his body was the reply. A volley of musketry\r\nfollowed, and effectually awoke the sleeping foe, who succeeded in\r\nletting off two of their guns as our men rushed on the battery.\r\nAn Irish soldier, named Reegan, springing forward, prevented the\r\ndischarge of the third gun. He bayoneted the gunner in the act of\r\napplying the port-fire, and was himself severely wounded. The rebel\r\nArtillerymen stood to their guns splendidly, and fought till they were\r\nall killed. The enemy's loss was severe; some 250 men were killed, and\r\nfour guns were captured. On our side 1 officer and 19 men were killed,\r\n7 officers and 85 men wounded, and 5 men missing. Amongst the wounded\r\nwas the gallant Commander of the column, and that fine soldier, Major\r\nJohn Coke, the Commandant of the 1st Punjab Infantry. The return to\r\ncamp was a stirring sight: the captured guns were brought home in\r\ntriumph, pushed along by the soldiers, all madly cheering, and the\r\nhorses ridden by men carrying their muskets with bayonets fixed.\r\n\r\nThe following morning the Punjab Movable Column arrived. Nicholson had\r\npreceded it by a few days, and from him I heard all about his fight\r\nwith the Sialkot mutineers at Trimmu Ghat and the various marches and\r\ncounter-marches which he had made since I left him at Philour.\r\n\r\nThe column was a most welcome addition to our force. It now consisted\r\nof the 52nd Light Infantry, a wing of the 61st Foot, a Field Battery,\r\na wing of the 1st Baluch Regiment, and the 2nd Punjab Infantry, beside\r\n200 newly-raised Multani Cavalry and 400 military police. This brought\r\nup our effective force to about 8,000 rank and file of all arms.[5] A\r\nmore powerful siege-train than we had hitherto possessed was on its\r\nway from Ferozepore, and three companies of the 8th Foot, detachments\r\nof Artillery and the 60th Rifles, the 4th Punjab Infantry, and about\r\n100 recruits for the 4th Sikhs were also marching towards Delhi. In\r\naddition, a small contingent from Kashmir and a few of the Jhind\r\nRaja's troops were shortly expected, after the arrival of which\r\nnothing in the shape of reinforcements could be looked for from the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nNor could we hope for any help from the south, for no definite news\r\nhad been received from Havelock since his letter of the 25th of July,\r\nand rumours had reached us that, finding it impossible to force his\r\nway to Lucknow, he had been obliged to retire upon Cawnpore. It was\r\nfelt, therefore, that if Delhi were to be taken at all, it must be\r\ntaken quickly, before our augmented numbers should be again diminished\r\nby sickness and casualties.\r\n\r\nThe enemy knew our position as well as we did, and appreciating the\r\ngreat value the siege-train would be to us, they decided on making a\r\nsupreme effort to intercept it. A few days before they had been foiled\r\nby Hodson in an attempt to cut off our communication with the Punjab,\r\nand were determined to ensure success on this occasion by employing a\r\nreally formidable force. This force left Delhi on the 24th August, and\r\nproceeded in the direction of the Najafgarh _jhil_.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak the following morning Nicholson started with sixteen Horse\r\nArtillery guns, 1,600 Infantry and 450 Cavalry, his orders being to\r\novertake the enemy and bring them to action. I hoped to have been of\r\nthe party, but Nicholson's request to have me as his staff officer\r\nwas refused, as I had not been taken off the sick-list, though I\r\nconsidered my wound was practically healed.\r\n\r\nIt proved a most difficult march. The rain fell in torrents, and the\r\nroads were mere quagmires. In the first nine miles two swamps had to\r\nbe got through, on crossing which Nicholson heard that the insurgents\r\nwere at Najafgarh, twelve miles further off. He determined to push on,\r\nand at 4 p.m. he found them occupying a strong position about a mile\r\nand three-quarters in length. In front was an old serai which was held\r\nin force with four guns, and on either side and in rear of the serai\r\nwas a village equally strongly held; while running round the enemy's\r\nright and rear was a huge drainage cut, swollen by the heavy rain.\r\nThis cut, or nulla, was crossed by a bridge immediately behind the\r\nrebels' position. Nicholson advanced from a side-road, which brought\r\nhim on their right with the nulla flowing between him and them. Even\r\nat the ford the water was breast-high, and it was with much difficulty\r\nand not without a good deal of delay that our troops crossed under a\r\nheavy fire from the serai. It was getting late, and Nicholson had only\r\ntime to make a hasty reconnaissance. He decided to attack the serai,\r\ndrive out the mutineers, and then, changing front to the left, to\r\nsweep down their line and get possession of the bridge.\r\n\r\nAs the Infantry were about to advance, Nicholson thus addressed\r\nthem: 'Men of the 61st, remember what Sir Colin Campbell said at\r\nChilianwala, and you have heard that he said the same to his gallant\r\nHighland Brigade at the Alma. I have the same request to make of you\r\nand the men of the 1st Bengal Fusiliers. Hold your fire until within\r\ntwenty or thirty yards, then fire and charge, and the serai is yours.'\r\nOur brave soldiers followed these directions to the letter, and, under\r\ncover of Artillery fire, carried the serai. Front was then changed to\r\nthe left as had been arranged, and the line swept along the enemy's\r\ndefences, the rebels flying before them over the bridge. They\r\nconfessed to a loss of more than 800 men, and they left in our hands\r\nthirteen field-pieces and a large quantity of ammunition, besides all\r\ntheir camp equipage, stores, camels, and horses. Our casualties were 2\r\nofficers and 23 men killed, and 3 officers and 68 men wounded--two of\r\nthe officers mortally, the third dangerously.\r\n\r\nThe enemy in the city, imagining from the size of the force sent with\r\nNicholson that we could not have many troops left in camp, attacked us\r\nin great strength on the following morning (26th), but were beaten off\r\nwith a loss on our side of only 8 killed and 13 wounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: According to the religion of Islam, Ishmail, not Isaac,\r\nwas to have been offered up by Abraham.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Forrest's 'The Indian Mutiny.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Since writing the above it has been brought to my notice\r\nthat the promptitude with which the troops were diverted to India\r\nwas due in a great measure to the foresight of Sir George Grey, the\r\nGovernor of the Cape, who, on hearing of the serious state of affairs\r\nin India, immediately ordered all transports which touched at the Cape\r\non their way to take part in the China Expeditionary Force, to proceed\r\ndirectly to Calcutta instead of to Singapore. He also despatched as\r\nmany of the Cape garrison as he could spare, with stores, etc., to\r\nIndia. It is right, therefore, that he should share with Lord Elgin\r\nthe credit of having so quickly grasped the magnitude of the crisis\r\nthrough which India was passing.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Owing to Brigadier-General Chamberlain having been placed\r\n_hors de combat_ by the severe wound he received the previous day,\r\nNorman was carrying on the duties of Adjutant-General.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: There were besides in camp at this time 1,535 sick and\r\nwounded, notwithstanding that several hundred men had been sent away.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n1857\r\n\r\n  Wilson's difficulties--Nicholson's resolve\r\n  --Arrangements for the assault--Construction of breaching batteries\r\n  --Nicholson expresses his satisfaction--Orders for the assault issued\r\n  --Composition of the attacking columns\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the 6th September all the reinforcements that could be expected,\r\nincluding the siege train (consisting of thirty-two pieces of ordnance\r\nwith ample ammunition) had arrived in camp, and the time had now come\r\nwhen it was necessary for Wilson to determine whether Delhi was to be\r\nassaulted, or whether the attempt must be given up. Long exposure to\r\nsun and rain began to tell terribly on the troops; sickness increased\r\nto an alarming extent, and on the 31st August there were 2,368 men in\r\nhospital--a number which, six days later, had risen to 2,977.\r\n\r\nNorman, on whose figures implicit reliance can be placed, states that\r\non this date the total number of effective rank and file of all arms,\r\nArtillery, Engineers, Cavalry, and Infantry, including gun-Lascars,\r\nNative drivers, newly-raised Sikh Pioneers, and recruits for the\r\nPunjab regiments, was 8,748.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the British troops was 3,217, composed of 580\r\nArtillery, 443 Cavalry, and 2,294 Infantry. The Infantry corps were\r\nmere skeletons, the strongest being only 409 effective rank and file.\r\nThe 52nd, which had arrived three weeks before with 600 healthy men,\r\nhad already dwindled to 242 fit for duty.\r\n\r\nThe above numbers are exclusive of the Kashmir Contingent of 2,200\r\nmen and four guns, which had by this time reached Delhi; and several\r\nhundred men of the Jhind troops (previously most usefully employed\r\nin keeping open our communication with Kurnal) were, at the Raja's\r\nparticular request, brought in to share in the glory of the capture of\r\nDelhi, the Raja himself accompanying them.\r\n\r\nNo one was more alive than the Commander of the Delhi Field Force to\r\nthe fact that no further aid could be expected, and no one realized\r\nmore keenly than he did that the strength of the little army at\r\nhis disposal was diminishing day by day. But Wilson had never been\r\nsanguine as to the possibility of capturing Delhi without aid from the\r\nsouth. In a letter to Baird-Smith dated the 20th August, he discussed\r\nat length his reasons for not being in a position to 'hold out any\r\nhope of being able to take the place until supported by the force from\r\nbelow.' He now was aware that no troops could be expected from the\r\nsouth, and Sir John Lawrence plainly told him that he had sent him the\r\nlast man he could spare from the Punjab. On the 29th August Lawrence\r\nwrote to Wilson: 'There seem to be very strong reasons for assaulting\r\nas soon as practicable. Every day's delay is fraught with danger.\r\nEvery day disaffection and mutiny spread. Every day adds to the danger\r\nof the Native Princes taking part against us.' But Wilson did not find\r\nit easy to make up his mind to assault. He was ill. Responsibility and\r\nanxiety had told upon him. He had grown nervous and hesitating, and\r\nthe longer it was delayed the more difficult the task appeared to him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKETCH TO ILLUSTRATE THE ENGAGEMENT AT NAJAFGARH IN\r\nAUGUST, 1857.]\r\n\r\nFortunately for the continuance of our rule in India, Wilson had about\r\nhim men who understood, as he was unable to do, the impossibility of\r\nour remaining any longer as we were. They knew that Delhi must\r\neither be taken or the army before it withdrawn. The man to whom\r\nthe Commander first looked for counsel under these conditions--\r\nBaird-Smith, of the Bengal Engineers--proved himself worthy of the\r\nhigh and responsible position in which he was placed. He too was ill.\r\nNaturally of a delicate constitution, the climate and exposure had\r\ntold upon him severely, and the diseases from which he was suffering\r\nwere aggravated by a wound he had received soon after his arrival in\r\ncamp. He fully appreciated the tremendous risks which an assault\r\ninvolved, but, in his opinion, they were less than were those of\r\ndelay. Whether convinced or not by his Chief Engineer's arguments,\r\nWilson accepted his advice and directed him to prepare a plan of\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nBaird-Smith was strongly supported by Nicholson, Chamberlain, Daly,\r\nNorman, and Alex. Taylor. They were one and all in communication with\r\nthe authorities in the Punjab, and they knew that if 'Delhi were not\r\ntaken, and that speedily, there would be a struggle not only for\r\nEuropean dominion, but even for European existence within the Punjab\r\nitself.'[1]\r\n\r\nOur position in that province was, indeed, most critical. An\r\nattempted conspiracy of Mahomedan tribes in the Murree Hills, and an\r\ninsurrection in the Gogaira district, had occurred. Both these affairs\r\nwere simply attempts to throw off the British yoke, made in the belief\r\nthat our last hour was come. The feeling that prompted them was not\r\nconfined to the Mahomedans; amongst all classes and races in the\r\nPunjab a spirit of restlessness was on the increase; even the most\r\nloyally disposed were speculating on the chances of our being able to\r\nhold our own, and doubting the advisability of adhering to our cause.\r\nOn the part of the Sikhs of the Manjha[2] there was an unwillingness\r\nto enlist, and no good recruits of this class could be obtained until\r\nafter Delhi had fallen.\r\n\r\nIt was under these critical circumstances that a council of war was\r\nconvened to decide definitely whether the assault should take place or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nNicholson was not a man of many intimacies, but as his staff officer\r\nI had been fortunate enough to gain his friendship. I was constantly\r\nwith him, and on this occasion I was sitting in his tent before he set\r\nout to attend the council. He had been talking to me in confidential\r\nterms of personal matters, and ended by telling me of his intention\r\nto take a very unusual step should the council fail to arrive at any\r\nfixed determination regarding the assault. 'Delhi must be taken,' he\r\nsaid, 'and it is absolutely essential that this should be done at\r\nonce; and if Wilson hesitates longer, I intend to propose at to-day's\r\nmeeting that he should be superseded.' I was greatly startled, and\r\nventured to remark that, as Chamberlain was _hors de combat_ from his\r\nwound, Wilson's removal would leave him, Nicholson, senior officer\r\nwith the force. He smiled as he answered: 'I have not overlooked that\r\nfact. I shall make it perfectly clear that, under the circumstances, I\r\ncould not possibly accept the command myself, and I shall propose that\r\nit be given to Campbell, of the 52nd; I am prepared to serve under him\r\nfor the time being, so no one can ever accuse me of being influenced\r\nby personal motives.'\r\n\r\nHappily, Nicholson was not called upon to take so unusual a step. I\r\nwalked with him to the Head-Quarters camp, waited in great excitement\r\nuntil the council of war was over, and, when Nicholson issued from the\r\nGeneral's tent, learnt, to my intense relief, that Wilson had agreed\r\nto the assault.\r\n\r\nThat Nicholson would have carried out his intention if the council had\r\ncome to a different conclusion I have not the slightest doubt, and\r\nI quite believe that his masterful spirit would have effected its\r\npurpose and borne down all opposition. Whether his action would have\r\nbeen right or wrong is another question, and one on which there is\r\nalways sure to be great difference of opinion. At the time it seemed\r\nto me that he was right. The circumstances were so exceptional--Wilson\r\nwould have proved himself so manifestly unfit to cope with them had\r\nhe decided on further delay--and the consequences of such delay would\r\nhave been so calamitous and far-reaching, that even now, after many\r\nyears have passed, and after having often thought over Nicholson's\r\nintended action and discussed the subject with other men, I have not\r\nchanged my opinion.\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of an attack on Delhi, preparations had been commenced\r\nearly in September, one of the first of these being to form a trench\r\nto the left of the 'Sammy House,' at the end of which a battery was\r\nconstructed for four 9-pounders and two 24-pounder howitzers. The\r\nobject of this battery was to prevent sorties from the Lahore or Kabul\r\ngates passing round the city wall to annoy our breaching batteries,\r\nand also to assist in keeping down the fire from the Mori bastion.[3]\r\nThis battery, moreover, led the enemy to believe that we should attack\r\nthem from our right, whereas it had been resolved to push the main\r\nattack from our left, where we could approach nearer to the walls\r\nunder cover, and where our flank was completely protected by the\r\nriver. The Engineers had also employed themselves in getting ready\r\n10,000 fascines, as many gabions, and 100,000 sand-bags, besides\r\nfield-magazines, scaling-ladders, and spare platforms.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th September Wilson issued an order informing the force that\r\narrangements for the assault would be commenced at once. He dwelt upon\r\nthe hardships and fatigue which had been cheerfully borne by officers\r\nand men, and expressed his hope that they would be rewarded for their\r\npast labours, 'and for a cheerful endurance of still greater fatigue\r\nand exposure.' He reminded the troops of the reasons for the deadly\r\nstruggle in which they were engaged, and he called upon all ranks to\r\nco-operate heart and soul in the arduous work now before them.\r\n\r\nGround was broken that evening. Unfortunately Baird-Smith was not able\r\nto personally superintend the construction of the breaching batteries,\r\nbut he had in his second-in-command, Alex. Taylor, a thoroughly\r\npractical Engineer, who not only knew how to work himself, but how to\r\nget work out of others. Ever alert and cheerful, he was trusted and\r\nlooked up to by all his subordinates, and was of all others the very\r\nman to be placed in charge of such a difficult and dangerous duty.\r\n\r\nThe first battery, known as No. 1, was traced out in two parts, about\r\n700 yards from the Mori bastion, which the right half, with its five\r\n18-pounders and one 8-inch howitzer, was intended to silence; while\r\nthe left half, with its four 24-pounders, was to hold the Kashmir\r\nbastion in check.\r\n\r\nAll night the Engineers worked at the battery, but although before day\r\nbroke it was nearly finished and armed, it was not ready to open fire\r\nuntil close on sunrise. The enemy did not fail to take advantage of\r\nthis chance. They poured in round after round of shot and grape,\r\ncausing many casualties. Their fire slackened as our guns were\r\ngradually able to make themselves felt, and by the afternoon it was\r\nsilenced. Nothing remained of the Mori bastion but a heap of ruins.\r\nNo. 1 battery was commanded by Major James Brind,[4] the bravest of\r\nthe brave. It was said of him that he 'never slept'; and Reid (of\r\n'Hindu Rao' fame) wrote of him: 'On all occasions the exertions of\r\nthis noble officer were indefatigable. He was always to be found where\r\nhis presence was most required; and the example he set to officers and\r\nmen was beyond all praise.'\r\n\r\nNo. 2 battery was next taken in hand. This was erected in front of\r\nLudlow Castle, and about 500 yards from the Kashmir gate. Like No. 1,\r\nit was formed in two parts, the right half being intended for\r\nseven heavy howitzers and two 18-pounders, and the left for nine\r\n24-pounders, commanded respectively by Majors Kaye and Campbell. All\r\nthese guns were intended to breach the Kashmir bastion, where the main\r\nassault was to be made.\r\n\r\nUp till this time the enemy had imagined that the attack would be\r\ndelivered from our right, and they were quite taken by surprise when,\r\non the evening of the 8th September, we occupied Ludlow Castle.\r\n\r\nBaird-Smith showed his grasp of the situation in attacking from\r\nour left, notwithstanding the greater distance of this part of our\r\nposition from the city wall. No counter-attack could be made on that\r\nflank, and the comparatively open ground between the Kashmir and Mori\r\nbastions would assist us in protecting the assaulting columns.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the enemy discovered their mistake, they did their utmost\r\nto prevent our batteries being constructed; but the Engineers were\r\nnot to be deterred. By the morning of the 11th No. 2 battery was\r\ncompleted, armed, and unmasked, and No. 3 and No. 4 batteries were\r\nmarked out in the Kudsiabagh. No. 3, commanded by Major Scott, was\r\nconstructed for six 18-pounders, and twelve 5-1/2-inch mortars under\r\nCaptain Blunt. Norman in his narrative says: 'The establishment of\r\nMajor Scott's battery within 180 yards of the wall, to arm which\r\nheavy guns had to be dragged from the rear under a constant fire of\r\nmusketry, was an operation that could rarely have been equalled in\r\nwar.' During the first night of its construction 89 men were killed\r\nand wounded; but with rare courage the workmen continued their task.\r\nThey were merely unarmed pioneers; and with that passive bravery so\r\ncharacteristic of Natives, as man after man was knocked over, they\r\nwould stop a moment, weep a little over a fallen friend, place his\r\nbody in a row along with the rest, and then work on as before.[5]\r\n\r\nNo. 4 battery, armed with ten heavy mortars, and commanded by Major\r\nTombs, was placed under the shelter of an old building, about half-way\r\nbetween No. 2 and No. 3 batteries.[6]\r\n\r\nI was posted to the left half of No. 2 battery, and had charge of the\r\ntwo right guns. At eight o'clock on the morning of the 11th September\r\nwe opened fire on the Kashmir bastion and the adjoining curtain, and\r\nas the shots told and the stones flew into the air and rattled down,\r\na loud cheer burst from the Artillerymen and some of the men of\r\nthe Carabineers and 9th Lancers who had volunteered to work in the\r\nbatteries. The enemy had got our range with wonderful accuracy, and\r\nimmediately on the screen in front of the right gun being removed, a\r\nround shot came through the embrasure, knocking two or three of us\r\nover. On regaining my feet, I found that the young Horse Artilleryman\r\nwho was serving the vent while I was laying the gun had had his right\r\narm taken off.\r\n\r\nIn the evening of the same day, when, wearied with hard work and\r\nexhausted by the great heat, we were taking a short rest, trusting to\r\nthe shelter of the battery for protection, a shower of grape came into\r\nus, severely wounding our commander, Campbell, whose place was taken\r\nby Edwin Johnson. We never left the battery until the day of the\r\nassault--the 14th--except to go by turns into Ludlow Castle for our\r\nmeals. Night and day the overwhelming fire was continued, and the\r\nincessant boom and roar of guns and mortars, with the ceaseless\r\nrain of shot and shell on the city, warned the mutineers that their\r\npunishment was at hand. We were not, however, allowed to have it all\r\nour own way. Unable to fire a gun from any of the three bastions we\r\nwere breaching, the enemy brought guns into the open and enfiladed\r\nour batteries. They sent rockets from their martello towers, and they\r\nmaintained a perfect storm of musketry from their advanced trench and\r\nfrom the city walls. No part of the attack was left unsearched by\r\ntheir fire, and though three months' incessant practice had made our\r\nmen skilful in using any cover they had, our losses were numerous, 327\r\nofficers and men being killed and wounded between the 7th and 14th\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 13th September Nicholson came to see whether we\r\ngunners had done our work thoroughly enough to warrant the assault\r\nbeing made the next morning. He was evidently satisfied, for when he\r\nentered our battery he said: 'I must shake hands with you fellows; you\r\nhave done your best to make my work easy to-morrow.'\r\n\r\nNicholson was accompanied by Taylor, who had to make certain that\r\nthe breaches were practicable, and for this purpose he detailed four\r\nsubaltern officers of Engineers to go to the walls as soon as it was\r\ndark, and report upon the condition they were in. Greathed and Home\r\nwere told off for the Water bastion breach, and Medley and Lang[7] for\r\nthat of the Kashmir bastion. Lang asked to be allowed to go while it\r\nwas yet daylight; Taylor agreed, and with an escort of four men of the\r\n60th Rifles he crept to the edge of the cover in the Kudsiabagh, and\r\nthen, running up the glacis, sat on top of the counterscarp for a few\r\nseconds studying the ditch and the two breaches. On his return Lang\r\nreported the breaches to be practicable; as, however, it was desirable\r\nto ascertain whether ladders would be necessary, he was sent again\r\nafter dark, in company with Medley. They took a ladder and a\r\nmeasuring-rod with them, and were escorted by an officer and\r\ntwenty-four riflemen, of whom all but six were left under cover in the\r\nKudsiabagh. Lang slipped into the ditch, which he found to be sixteen\r\nfeet deep. Medley handed him the ladder and rod, and followed him with\r\ntwo riflemen, the other four remaining on the crest of the glacis to\r\ncover their retreat. With the help of the ladder they ascended the\r\nberm and measured the height of the wall. Two minutes more, and they\r\nwould have reached the top of the breach, but, quiet as they had been,\r\ntheir movements had attracted attention, and several of the enemy\r\nwere heard running towards the breach. The whole party reascended as\r\nrapidly as possible, and, throwing themselves on the grass, waited in\r\nbreathless silence, hoping the sepoys would go away, and that they\r\nmight be able to make another attempt to reach the top of the breach.\r\nThe rebels, however, gave no signs of retiring, and as all needful\r\ninformation had been obtained, they determined to run for it. A volley\r\nwas fired at the party as they dashed across the open, but no one was\r\nhit.\r\n\r\nGreathed and Home had been equally successful, and by midnight\r\nBaird-Smith was able to report to General Wilson that both breaches\r\nwere practicable.\r\n\r\nBaird-Smith urged the importance of attacking without delay. He\r\npointed out the impossibility of continuing the high pressure at which\r\nnearly every man[8] in the force had been working during the past few\r\ndays; that the tension was becoming too severe to last; and that every\r\nhour that passed without assaulting was a loss to us and a gain to the\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nBefore Wilson and Baird-Smith separated, orders had been issued for\r\nthe attack to be made at daybreak the next morning, the 14th.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that there were to be four assaulting columns and one\r\nreserve column.\r\n\r\nThe first, second and third columns, which were to operate on our\r\nleft, were under the command of Brigadier-General Nicholson, who\r\npersonally led No. 1 column. It consisted of:\r\n\r\n  MEN.\r\n  Her Majesty's 75th Foot                       300\r\n  1st Bengal Fusiliers                          250\r\n  2nd Punjab Infantry                           450\r\n                                              -----\r\n  Total                                       1,000\r\n\r\nand was meant to storm the breach near the Kashmir bastion.\r\n\r\n[Note: I am indebted to the kindness of Mrs. Barter, the widow of my\r\ngallant friend and comrade. General Richard Barter, C.B., who served\r\nthroughout the Mutiny with the 75th Foot, first as Adjutant and\r\nafterwards as Captain, for the above 'Daily State' and for the\r\nfollowing extract from that officer's diary:\r\n\r\n'In the evening the order was published for the storming of Delhi a\r\nlittle before daybreak the next morning, September 14, and we each\r\nof us looked carefully to the reloading of our pistols, filling of\r\nflasks, and getting as good protection as possible for our heads,\r\nwhich would be exposed so much going up the ladders. I wound two\r\npuggris or turbans round my old forage cap, with the last letter from\r\nthe hills [Mrs. Barter was then at Kasauli, in the Himalayas] in the\r\ntop, and committed myself to the care of Providence. There was not\r\nmuch sleep that night in our camp. I dropped off now and then, but\r\nnever for long, and whenever I woke I could see that there was a light\r\nin more than one of the officers' tents, and talking was going on in\r\na low tone amongst the men, the snapping of a lock or springing of a\r\nramrod sounding far in the still air, telling of preparation for\r\nthe coming strife. A little after midnight we fell in as quietly as\r\npossible, and by the light of a lantern the orders for the assault\r\nwere then read to the men. They were to the following purport: Any\r\nofficer or man who might be wounded was to be left where he fell; no\r\none was to step from the ranks to help him, as there were no men to\r\nspare. If the assault were successful he would be taken away in the\r\ndoolies, or litters, and carried to the rear, or wherever he could\r\nbest receive medical assistance. If we failed, wounded and sound\r\nshould be prepared to bear the worst. There was to be no plundering,\r\nbut all prize taken was to be put into a common stock for fair\r\ndivision after all was over. No prisoners were to be made, as we\r\nhad no one to guard them, and care was to be taken that no women or\r\nchildren were injured. To this the men answered at once, by \"No fear,\r\nsir.\" The officers now pledged their honours on their swords to abide\r\nby these orders, and the men then promised to follow their example.\r\nAt this moment, just as the regiment was about to march off, Father\r\nBertrand came up in his vestments, and, addressing the Colonel, begged\r\nfor permission to bless the regiment, saying: \"We may differ some\r\nof us in matters of religion, but the blessing of an old man and a\r\nclergyman can do nothing but good.\" The Colonel at once assented, and\r\nFather Bertrand, lifting his hands to Heaven, blessed the regiment in\r\na most impressive manner, offering up at the same time a prayer for\r\nour success and for mercy on the souls of those soon to die.']\r\n\r\nNo. 2 column, under Brigadier Jones, of Her Majesty's 61st Foot,\r\nconsisted of:\r\n\r\n  MEN.\r\n  Her Majesty's 8th Foot              250\r\n  2nd Bengal Fusiliers                250\r\n  4th Sikhs                           350\r\n                                      ---\r\n  Total                               850\r\n\r\nand was intended for the storming of the breach near the Water\r\nbastion.\r\n\r\nNo. 3 column, under Colonel Campbell, of Her Majesty's 52nd Light\r\nInfantry, consisted of:\r\n\r\n  MEN.\r\n  Her Majesty's 52nd Light Infantry         200\r\n  Kumaon Battalion                          250\r\n  1st Punjab Infantry                       500\r\n                                            ---\r\n  Total                                     950\r\n\r\nand was told off to enter the Kashmir gate after it had been blown in.\r\n\r\nNo. 4 column was to operate on our right. It was commanded by Major\r\nReid, of the Sirmur battalion, and was composed of that regiment, the\r\nGuides Infantry, and such men from the piquets (European and Native)\r\nas could be spared. Its strength was 860 men, besides 1,200 of the\r\nKashmir Contingent, and its orders were to attack the suburbs of\r\nKisenganj and Paharipur, and support the main attack by effecting an\r\nentrance at the Kabul gate.\r\n\r\nThe Reserve column, under Brigadier Longfield, Her Majesty's 8th Foot,\r\nwas told to await the result of the attack, and afford assistance\r\nwherever required. It consisted of:\r\n\r\n  MEN.\r\n  Her Majesty's 61st Foot                    250\r\n  4th Punjab Infantry                        450\r\n  Wing Baluch battalion                      300\r\n                                           -----\r\n  Total                                    1,000\r\n\r\nwith 300 of the Jhind Contingent.\r\n\r\nThere were besides 200 of the 60th Rifles, who were to cover the\r\nadvance of Nicholson's columns, and join the reserve as soon as the\r\nassaults had been carried out.\r\n\r\nIn order to provide these five columns, in all hardly 5,000 strong,\r\nthe services of every man who could bear arms had to be put into\r\nrequisition. Piquets were weakened to a dangerous extent, and many of\r\nthe sick and wounded who ought to have been in hospital were utilized\r\nfor the protection of the camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Punjab Administration Report, 1857-58.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The tract of country between the Sutlej and Ravi rivers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Norman's narrative.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The late General Sir James Brind, G.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: 'The Indian Mutiny,' by Forrest.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: When his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales was coming to\r\nIndia in 1875, I obtained permission from Lord Napier of Magdala, who\r\nwas then Commander-in-Chief, to erect miniature embrasures to mark\r\nthe gun of direction of each of the breaching batteries; and on these\r\nembrasures are recorded the number, armament, and object of the\r\nbatteries.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Colonel Arthur Lang is the only one of the four now\r\nalive.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Nearly every man was on duty.

A further\r\ndelay was caused by our having to destroy the partial repairs to the\r\nbreaches which the enemy had succeeded in effecting during the night,\r\nnotwithstanding the steady fire we had kept up.\r\n\r\nWhile we were thus engaged, the Infantry were ordered to lie down\r\nunder cover. Standing on the crenellated wall which separated Ludlow\r\nCastle from the road, I saw Nicholson at the head of his column, and\r\nwondered what was passing through his mind. Was he thinking of the\r\nfuture, or of the wonderful part he had played during the past four\r\nmonths? At Peshawar he had been Edwardes's right hand. At the head\r\nof the Movable Column he had been mainly instrumental in keeping the\r\nPunjab quiet, and at Delhi everyone felt that during the short time\r\nhe had been with us he was our guiding star, and that but for his\r\npresence in the camp the assault which he was about to lead would\r\nprobably never have come off. He was truly 'a tower of strength.' Any\r\nfeeling of reluctance to serve under a Captain of the Company's army,\r\nwhich had at first been felt by some, had been completely overcome by\r\nhis wonderful personality. Each man in the force, from the General in\r\ncommand to the last-joined private soldier, recognized that the man\r\nwhom the wild people on the frontier had deified--the man of whom a\r\nlittle time before Edwardes had said to Lord Canning, 'You may rely\r\nupon this, that if ever there is a desperate deed to be done in India,\r\nJohn Nicholson is the man to do it'--was one who had proved himself\r\nbeyond all doubt capable of grappling with the crisis through which we\r\nwere passing--one to follow to the death. Faith in the Commander who\r\nhad claimed and been given the post of honour was unbounded, and every\r\nman was prepared 'to do or die' for him.\r\n\r\nThe sun had risen high in the heavens, when the breaching guns\r\nsuddenly ceased, and each soldier felt he had but a brief moment in\r\nwhich to brace himself for the coming conflict. Nicholson gave the\r\nsignal. The 60th Rifles with a loud cheer dashed to the front in\r\nskirmishing order, while at the same moment the heads of the first and\r\nsecond columns appeared from the Kudsiabagh and moved steadily towards\r\nthe breaches.\r\n\r\nNo sooner were the front ranks seen by the rebels than a storm of\r\nbullets met them from every side, and officers and men fell thick on\r\nthe crest of the glacis. Then, for a few seconds, amidst a blaze of\r\nmusketry, the soldiers stood at the edge of the ditch, for only one or\r\ntwo of the ladders had come up, the rest having been dropped by their\r\nkilled or wounded carriers. Dark figures crowded on the breach,\r\nhurling stones upon our men and daring them to come on. More ladders\r\nwere brought up, they were thrown into the ditch, and our men, leaping\r\ninto it, raised them against the escarp on the other side. Nicholson,\r\nat the head of a part of his column, was the first to ascend the\r\nbreach in the curtain. The remainder of his troops diverged a little\r\nto the right to escalade the breach in the Kashmir bastion. Here\r\nLieutenants Barter and Fitzgerald, of the 75th Foot, were the first to\r\nmount, and here the latter fell mortally wounded. The breaches were\r\nquickly filled with dead and dying, but the rebels were hurled back,\r\nand the ramparts which had so long resisted us were our own.\r\n\r\nThe breach at the Water bastion was carried by No. 2 column. No sooner\r\nwas its head seen emerging from the cover of the old Custom-house than\r\nit was met by a terrible discharge of musketry. Both the Engineer\r\nofficers (Greathed and Hovenden) who were leading it fell severely\r\nwounded, and of the thirty-nine men who carried the ladders\r\ntwenty-nine were killed or wounded in as many seconds. The ladders\r\nwere immediately seized by their comrades, who, after one or two vain\r\nattempts, succeeded in placing them against the escarp. Then, amidst\r\na shower of stones and bullets, the soldiers ascended, rushed the\r\nbreach, and, slaying all before them, drove the rebels from the walls.\r\n\r\nNo. 3 column had in the meanwhile advanced towards the Kashmir gate\r\nand halted. Lieutenants Home and Salkeld, with eight Sappers and\r\nMiners and a bugler of the 52nd Foot, went forward to blow the gate\r\nopen. The enemy were apparently so astounded at the audacity of\r\nthis proceeding that for a minute or two they offered but slight\r\nresistance. They soon, however, discovered how small the party was and\r\nthe object for which it had come, and forthwith opened a deadly fire\r\nupon the gallant little band from the top of the gateway, from the\r\ncity wall, and through the open wicket.\r\n\r\nThe bridge over the ditch in front of the gateway had been destroyed,\r\nand it was with some difficulty that the single beam which remained\r\ncould be crossed. Home with the men carrying the powder-bags got\r\nover first. As the bags were being attached to the gate, Sergeant\r\nCarmichael was killed and Havildar Madhoo wounded; the rest then\r\nslipped into the ditch to allow the firing party which had come up\r\nunder Salkeld to carry out its share of the duty.\r\n\r\nWhile endeavouring to fire the charge, Salkeld, being shot through\r\nthe leg and arm, handed the slow-match to Corporal Burgess, who fell\r\nmortally wounded, but not until he had successfully performed his\r\ntask.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the explosion had taken place, Bugler Hawthorne sounded\r\nthe regimental call of the 52nd. Meeting with no response, he sounded\r\ntwice again. The noise of firing and shouting was so great that\r\nneither the sound of the bugle nor that of the explosion reached the\r\ncolumn, but Campbell, after allowing the firing party what he thought\r\nwas sufficient time, gave the order to advance. Captain Crosse, of the\r\n52nd, was the first to reach the gate, followed closely by Corporal\r\nTaylor of his own company, and Captain Synge of the same regiment, who\r\nwas Campbell's Brigade-Major. In single file along the narrow plank\r\nthey crossed the ditch in which lay the shattered remnant of the\r\ngallant little band; they crept through the wicket, which was the only\r\npart blown in, and found the interior of the gateway blocked by an\r\n18-pounder gun, under which were lying the scorched bodies of two or\r\nthree sepoys, who had evidently been killed by the explosion. The rest\r\nof the column followed as rapidly as the precarious crossing would\r\nadmit, and when Campbell got inside he found himself face to face with\r\nboth Nicholson's and Jones's columns, which, after mounting the three\r\nbreaches, poured in a mingled crowd into the open space between the\r\nKashmir gate and the church.\r\n\r\nNo. 4 column advanced from the Sabzi Mandi towards Kisenganj and\r\nPaharipur. Reid, the commander, was unfortunately wounded early in the\r\nday. Several other officers were either killed or wounded, and for\r\na little time a certain amount of confusion existed owing to some\r\nmisconception as to whether the command of the column should be\r\nexercised by the senior officer with the regular troops, or by the\r\npolitical officer with the Kashmir Contingent. The fighting was very\r\nsevere. The enemy were in great numbers, and strongly posted on\r\nthe banks of the canal--indeed, at one time there appeared to be a\r\nlikelihood of their breaking into our weakly-guarded camp or turning\r\nthe flank of our storming parties. The guns at Hindu Rao's house,\r\nhowever, prevented such a catastrophe by pouring shrapnel into the\r\nranks of the rebels; and just at the critical moment Hope Grant\r\nbrought up the Cavalry brigade, which had been covering the assaulting\r\ncolumns. The Horse Artillery dashed to the front and opened fire upon\r\nthe enemy. From the gardens and houses of Kisenganj, only two or three\r\nhundred yards off, the mutineers poured a deadly fire of musketry on\r\nour men, and from the bastion near the Lahore gate showers of grape\r\ncaused serious losses amongst them. Owing to the nature of the ground\r\nthe Cavalry could not charge. Had they retired the guns would have\r\nbeen captured, and had the guns been withdrawn the position would have\r\nbeen lost. For two hours the troopers drawn up in battle array sat\r\nmotionless, while their ranks were being cruelly raked. Not a man\r\nwavered. Hope Grant and four of his staff had their horses killed\r\nunder them; two of them were wounded, and Hope Grant himself was hit\r\nby a spent shot. In Tombs's troop of Horse Artillery alone, 25 men out\r\nof 50 were wounded, and 17 horses either killed or wounded. The\r\n9th Lancers had 38 casualties amongst the men, and lost 71 horses.\r\n'Nothing daunted,' wrote Hope Grant, 'those gallant soldiers held\r\ntheir trying position with patient endurance; and on my praising them\r\nfor their good behaviour, they declared their readiness to stand the\r\nfire as long as I chose. The behaviour of the Native Cavalry,' he\r\nadded, 'was also admirable. Nothing could be steadier; nothing could\r\nbe more soldierlike than their bearing.'\r\n\r\nThe bold front shown by the Horse Artillery and Cavalry enabled No. 4\r\ncolumn to retire in an orderly manner behind Hindu Rao's house, and\r\nalso assisted the Kashmir Contingent in its retreat from the Idgah,\r\nwhere it was defeated with the loss of four guns. The repulse of this\r\ncolumn added considerably to our difficulties by freeing many hundreds\r\nto take part in the fight which was being fiercely carried on within\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the three assaulting columns had made good their lodgment on\r\nthe walls. The guns in the Kashmir and Water bastions had been turned\r\nso as to allow of their being used against the foe, and preparations\r\nwere made for the next move.\r\n\r\nNicholson's orders were to push his way to the Ajmir gate, by the road\r\nrunning inside the city wall, and to clear the ramparts and bastions\r\nas he went. Jones was to make for the Kabul gate, and Campbell for the\r\nJama Masjid.\r\n\r\nThese three columns reformed inside the Kashmir gate, from which\r\npoint the first and second practically became one. Nicholson, being\r\naccidentally separated from his own column for a short time, pushed on\r\nwith Campbell's past the church, in the direction of the Jama Masjid,\r\nwhile the amalgamated column under Jones's leadership took the rampart\r\nroute past the Kabul gate (on the top of which Jones had planted a\r\nBritish flag), capturing as they advanced all the guns they found\r\non the ramparts, and receiving no check until the Burn bastion was\r\nreached by some of the more adventurous spirits. Here the enemy,\r\ntaking heart at seeing but a small number of opponents, made a stand.\r\nThey brought up a gun, and, occupying all the buildings on the south\r\nside of the rampart with Infantry, they poured forth such a heavy fire\r\nthat a retirement to the Kabul gate had to be effected.\r\n\r\nIt was at this point that Nicholson rejoined his own column. His\r\nhaughty spirit could not brook the idea of a retirement; however\r\nslight the check might be, he knew that it would restore to the rebels\r\nthe confidence of which our hitherto successful advance had deprived\r\nthem, and, believing that there was nothing that brave men could not\r\nachieve, he determined to make a fresh attempt to seize the Burn\r\nbastion.\r\n\r\nThe lane which was again to be traversed was about 200 yards long,\r\nwith the city wall and rampart on the right, and on the left\r\nflat-roofed houses with parapets, affording convenient shelter for the\r\nenemy's sharp-shooters.\r\n\r\nAs the troops advanced up this lane the mutineers opened upon them a\r\nheavy and destructive fire. Again and again they were checked, and\r\nagain and again they reformed and advanced. It was in this lane that\r\nMajor Jacob, the gallant Commander of the 1st Bengal Fusiliers, fell,\r\nmortally wounded. His men wanted to carry him to the rear, but he\r\nwould not allow them to remain behind for him, and refused their help,\r\nurging them to press forward against the foe. The officers, leading\r\nfar ahead of their men, were shot down one after the other, and the\r\nmen, seeing them fall, began to waver. Nicholson, on this, sprang\r\nforward, and called upon the soldiers to follow him. He was instantly\r\nshot through the chest.\r\n\r\nA second retirement to the Kabul gate was now inevitable, and there\r\nall that was left of the first and second columns remained for the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nCampbell's column, guided by Sir Theophilus Metcalfe, who from his\r\nintimate acquaintance with the city as Magistrate and Collector of\r\nDelhi was able to conduct it by the route least exposed to the enemy's\r\nfire, forced its way to the vicinity of the Jama Masjid, where it\r\nremained for half an hour, hoping that the other columns would come to\r\nits assistance. They, however, as has been shown, had more than enough\r\nto do elsewhere, and Campbell (who was wounded), seeing no chance of\r\nbeing reinforced, and having no Artillery or powder-bags with which to\r\nblow in the gates of the Jama Masjid, fell back leisurely and in order\r\non the church, where he touched what was left of the Reserve column,\r\nwhich had gradually been broken up to meet the demands of the\r\nassaulting force, until the 4th Punjab Infantry alone remained to\r\nrepresent it.\r\n\r\nWhile what I have just described was taking place, I myself was with\r\nGeneral Wilson. Edwin Johnson and I, being no longer required with the\r\nbreaching batteries, had been ordered to return to our staff duties,\r\nand we accordingly joined the General at Ludlow Castle, where he\r\narrived shortly before the assaulting columns moved from the cover of\r\nthe Kudsiabagh.\r\n\r\nWilson watched the assault from the top of the house, and when he was\r\nsatisfied that it had proved successful, he rode through the Kashmir\r\ngate to the church, where he remained for the rest of the day.\r\n\r\nHe was ill and tired out, and as the day wore on and he received\r\ndiscouraging reports, he became more and more anxious and depressed.\r\nHe heard of Reid's failure, and of Reid himself having been severely\r\nwounded; then came the disastrous news that Nicholson had fallen, and\r\na report (happily false) that Hope Grant and Tombs were both killed.\r\nAll this greatly agitated and distressed the General, until at last he\r\nbegan seriously to consider the advisability of leaving the city and\r\nfalling back on the Ridge.\r\n\r\nI was ordered to go and find out the truth of these reports, and to\r\nascertain exactly what had happened to No. 4 column and the Cavalry on\r\nour right.\r\n\r\nJust after starting on my errand, while riding through the Kashmir\r\ngate, I observed by the side of the road a doolie, without bearers,\r\nand with evidently a wounded man inside. I dismounted to see if I\r\ncould be of any use to the occupant, when I found, to my grief and\r\nconsternation, that it was John Nicholson, with death written on his\r\nface. He told me that the bearers had put the doolie down and gone off\r\nto plunder; that he was in great pain, and wished to be taken to the\r\nhospital. He was lying on his back, no wound was visible, and but for\r\nthe pallor of his face, always colourless, there was no sign of the\r\nagony he must have been enduring. On my expressing a hope that he was\r\nnot seriously wounded, he said: 'I am dying; there is no chance for\r\nme.' The sight of that great man lying helpless and on the point of\r\ndeath was almost more than I could bear. Other men had daily died\r\naround me, friends and comrades had been killed beside me, but I never\r\nfelt as I felt then--to lose Nicholson seemed to me at that moment to\r\nlose everything.\r\n\r\nI searched about for the doolie-bearers, who, with other\r\ncamp-followers, were busy ransacking the houses and shops in the\r\nneighbourhood, and carrying off everything of the slightest value they\r\ncould lay their hands on. Having with difficulty collected four men,\r\nI put them in charge of a sergeant of the 61st Foot. Taking down his\r\nname, I told him who the wounded officer was, and ordered him to go\r\ndirect to the field hospital.\r\n\r\nThat was the last I saw of Nicholson. I found time to ride several\r\ntimes to the hospital to inquire after him, but I was never allowed to\r\nsee him again.\r\n\r\nContinuing my ride, I soon came up with Hope Grant's brigade. It had\r\nshortly before been relieved from its perilous and unpleasant position\r\nas a target for the enemy by the timely arrival of the Guides Infantry\r\nand a detachment of the Baluch battalion. I was rejoiced to find Tombs\r\nalive and unhurt, and from him and other officers of my regiment I\r\nlearnt the tremendous peppering they had undergone. Hodson was also\r\nthere with his newly-raised regiment, some officers of the 9th\r\nLancers, and Dighton Probyn, Watson, and Younghusband, of the Punjab\r\nCavalry. Probyn was in great spirits, having fallen temporarily\r\ninto the command of his squadron, owing to Charles Nicholson (John\r\nNicholson's younger brother) having been selected to take Coke's place\r\nwith the 1st Punjab Infantry. Probyn retained his command throughout\r\nthe campaign, for Charles Nicholson was wounded that very morning\r\nwhile gallantly leading his regiment. His right arm was being\r\namputated when his heroic brother was carried mortally wounded into\r\nthe same hospital, and laid on the bed next to him.\r\n\r\nIt seemed so important to acquaint the General without delay that Hope\r\nGrant and Tombs were both alive, that the Cavalry had been relieved\r\nfrom their exposed position, and that there was no need for further\r\nanxiety about Reid's column, that I galloped back to the church as\r\nquickly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe news I was able to give for the moment somewhat cheered the\r\nGeneral, but did not altogether dispel his gloomy forebodings; and the\r\nfailure of Campbell's column (which just at that juncture returned to\r\nthe church), the hopelessness of Nicholson's condition, and, above\r\nall, the heavy list of casualties he received later, appeared to crush\r\nall spirit and energy out of him. His dejection increased, and he\r\nbecame more than ever convinced that his wisest course was to withdraw\r\nfrom the city. He would, I think, have carried out this fatal measure,\r\nnotwithstanding that every officer on his staff was utterly opposed\r\nto any retrograde movement, had it not been his good fortune to have\r\nbeside him a man sufficiently bold and resolute to stimulate his\r\nflagging energies. Baird-Smith's indomitable courage and determined\r\nperseverance were never more conspicuous than at that critical moment,\r\nwhen, though suffering intense pain from his wound, and weakened by\r\na wasting disease, he refused to be put upon the sick-list; and on\r\nWilson appealing to him for advice as to whether he should or should\r\nnot hold on to the position we had gained, the short but decisive\r\nanswer, 'We _must_ hold on,' was given in such a determined and\r\nuncompromising tone that it put an end to all discussion.\r\n\r\nNeville Chamberlain gave similar advice. Although still suffering from\r\nhis wound, and only able to move about with difficulty, he had taken\r\nup his position at Hindu Rao's house, from which he exercised, as\r\nfar as his physical condition would allow, a general supervision and\r\ncontrol over the events that took place on the right of the Ridge. He\r\nwas accompanied by Daly and a very distinguished Native officer of the\r\nGuides, named Khan Sing Rosa, both of whom, like Chamberlain, were\r\nincapacitated by wounds from active duty. From the top of Hindu Rao's\r\nhouse Chamberlain observed the first successes of the columns, and\r\ntheir subsequent checks and retirements, and it was while he was there\r\nthat he received two notes from General Wilson. In the first, written\r\nafter the failure of the attacks on the Jama Masjid and the Lahore\r\ngate, the General asked for the return of the Baluch battalion, which,\r\nat Chamberlain's request, had been sent to reinforce Reid's column,\r\nand in it he expressed the hope that 'we shall be able to hold what\r\nwe have got.' In the second note, written at four o'clock in the\r\nafternoon, the General asked whether Chamberlain 'could do anything\r\nfrom Hindu Rao's house to assist,' adding, 'our numbers are\r\nfrightfully reduced, and we have lost so many senior officers that the\r\nmen are not under proper control; indeed, I doubt if they could be got\r\nto do anything dashing. I want your advice. If the Hindu Rao's piquet\r\ncannot be moved, I do not think we shall be strong enough to take the\r\ncity.' Chamberlain understood General Wilson's second note to imply\r\nthat he contemplated withdrawing the troops from the city, and he\r\nframed his reply accordingly. In it he urged the necessity for holding\r\non to the last; he pointed out the advantages already gained, and the\r\ndemoralization thereby inflicted upon the enemy. The dying Nicholson\r\nadvocated the same course with almost his latest breath. So angry and\r\nexcited was he when he was told of the General's suggestion to retire,\r\nthat he exclaimed, 'Thank God I have strength yet to shoot him, if\r\nnecessary.' There was no resisting such a consensus of responsible and\r\nreliable opinion, and Wilson gave up all idea of retreating.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon of the 14th, Norman, Johnson, and I, at the\r\nGeneral's desire and for his information, visited every position\r\noccupied by our troops within the city walls. In some places there\r\nwas great confusion--men without their officers, and officers without\r\ntheir men--all without instructions, and not knowing what was going on\r\nin their immediate neighbourhood, the inevitable result of the rapid\r\nadvance. We did what we could to remedy matters, and were able to\r\nreport to Wilson that our troops were holding the wall from the Water\r\nbastion to the Kabul gate in sufficient strength. But this was all the\r\ncomfort we could give him. The fact is, too much had been attempted\r\non that eventful morning. We should have been satisfied with gaining\r\npossession of the Kashmir and Water bastions, and getting a lodgment\r\nwithin the city walls. This was as much as three such weak columns\r\nshould have tried, or been asked to accomplish. No one who was\r\npresent on that occasion, and experienced the difficulty, indeed\r\nimpossibility, of keeping soldiers in hand while engaged in fighting\r\nalong narrow streets and tortuous lanes, would ever again attempt what\r\nwas expected of the assaulting columns.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in this duty we (Norman, Johnson and I) were attacked by\r\na party of the enemy who had been hiding in considerable numbers in a\r\nside-lane watching for a chance. A fight ensued; we had only a small\r\nguard with us, but, fortunately, the firing was heard by the men of a\r\nnear piquet, some of whom came to our help. With their assistance we\r\ndrove off the sepoys, but in the scrimmage my poor mare was shot. She\r\nwas a very useful animal, and her death was a great loss to me at the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAt sunset on the 14th of September only a very small portion of the\r\nwalls of Delhi was in our possession. The densely-populated city\r\nremained to be conquered. The magazine, the palace, and the Fort of\r\nSelimgarh, all strongly fortified, were still in the hands of the\r\nenemy. The narrow strip of ground we had gained had been won at severe\r\nloss. Three out of the four officers who commanded the assaulting\r\ncolumns had been disabled, and 66 officers and 1,104 men had been\r\nkilled and wounded.\r\n\r\nThe night of the 14th was spent by the General and staff in 'Skinner's\r\nhouse,'[1] close to the church. Rest was badly needed, for almost\r\neveryone in the force, officers and men alike, had been hard at work,\r\nnight and day, for a week. That night, luckily, we were allowed to be\r\nat peace, for whether it was that the rebels were as tired as we were,\r\nor that they were busy making preparations for further resistance,\r\nthey did not disturb us; and when day broke we were all refreshed and\r\nready to continue the struggle. At one time, indeed, early in the\r\nevening, the enemy appeared from their movements to be preparing to\r\nattack us, but just at that moment the band of the 4th Punjab Infantry\r\nstruck up 'Cheer, Boys, Cheer!' upon which the men of the regiment did\r\ncheer, most lustily, and other regiments caught up and continued the\r\ninspiriting hurrahs, which apparently had the effect of disconcerting\r\nthe mutineers and keeping them quiet.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The house belonged to the Skinner family, and was\r\noriginally built by James Skinner, a Eurasian, who served the Moghul\r\nEmperor with great distinction towards the end of the last century.\r\nWhen Lord Lake broke up that Mahomedan Prince's power, Skinner entered\r\nthe service of the East India Company and rose to the rank of Major.\r\nHe was also a C.B. He raised the famous Skinner's Horse, now the 1st\r\nBengal Cavalry. His father was an officer in one of His Majesty's\r\nregiments of Foot, and after one of Lord Clive's battles married a\r\nRajput lady of good family, who with her father and mother had been\r\ntaken prisoners. Skinner himself married a Mahomedan, so that he had\r\nan interest in the three religions, Christian, Hindu, and Mahomedan,\r\nand on one occasion, when left on the ground severely wounded, he made\r\na vow that if his life were spared he would build three places of\r\nworship--a church, a temple, and a mosque. He fulfilled his vow, and\r\na few years later he built the church at Delhi, and the temple and\r\nmosque which are in close proximity to it.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n1857\r\n\r\n  Capture of the Burn bastion--The 60th Rifles storm the palace\r\n  --Hodson captures the King of Delhi--Nicholson's death\r\n  --Gallantry of the troops--Praise from Lord Canning\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 15th the situation was reviewed, and\r\npreparations made for the conquest of the city. Order was restored\r\namongst the troops, who, as I have shown, had become somewhat\r\ndemoralized by the street fighting. Regiments and brigades were got\r\ntogether; raids were made on all the store shops within reach, and\r\nevery bottle of beer and spirits was broken.[1] Some of the liquor\r\nwould doubtless have been of great use in the hospitals, but there was\r\nno means of removing it, and the General wisely determined that it was\r\nbest to put temptation out of the men's way. Guns and mortars were\r\nplaced into position for shelling the city and palace, and a few\r\nhouses near, where the enemy's sharpshooters had established\r\nthemselves, were seized and occupied. We soon, however, gave up\r\nattacking such positions, for we found that street fighting could not\r\nbe continued without the loss of more men than we had to spare, and\r\nthat the wisest plan would be to keep the soldiers under cover as much\r\nas possible while we sapped from house to house. A battery commanding\r\nSelimgarh and part of the palace was constructed in the college\r\ngardens, and a breach was made in the wall of the magazine, which was\r\ncaptured the next morning with but slight loss.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th, and again on the 18th, Chamberlain took command of the\r\ntroops inside the city while the General rested for a few hours. He\r\nwas, as he expressed himself in a note to Chamberlain, 'completely\r\ndone.'\r\n\r\nThe enemy now began to draw in their line. The suburbs were evacuated,\r\nand riding through the Sabzi Mandi, Kisenganj and Paharipur, we gazed\r\nwith wonder at the size and strength of the works raised against us by\r\nthe mutineers, in attacking which we had experienced such heavy loss\r\nduring the early days of the siege, and from which No. 4 column had\r\nbeen obliged to retire on the day of the assault.\r\n\r\nThe smaller the position that had to be defended, the greater became\r\nthe numbers concentrated in our immediate front, and every inch of our\r\nway through the city was stoutly disputed; but the advance, though\r\nslow, was steady, and considering the numbers of the insurgents, and\r\nthe use they made at close quarters of their Field Artillery, our\r\ncasualties were fewer than could have been expected.\r\n\r\nI had been placed under the orders of Taylor, Baird-Smith's\r\nindefatigable Lieutenant, who directed the advance towards the Lahore\r\ngate. We worked through houses, courtyards, and lanes, until on the\r\nafternoon of the 19th we found ourselves in rear of the Burn bastion,\r\nthe attempt to take which on the 14th had cost the life of the gallant\r\nNicholson and so many other brave men. We had with us fifty European\r\nand fifty Native soldiers, the senior officer of the party being\r\nCaptain Gordon, of the 75th Foot. A single door separated us from the\r\nlane which led to the Burn bastion. Lang, of the Engineers, burst this\r\ndoor open, and out dashed the party. Rushing across the lane and up\r\nthe ramp, the guard was completely surprised, and the bastion was\r\nseized without our losing a man.\r\n\r\nEarly the next day we were still sapping our way towards the Lahore\r\ngate, when we suddenly found ourselves in a courtyard in which were\r\nhuddled together some forty or fifty _banias_,[2] who were evidently\r\nas much in terror of the sepoys as they were of us. The men of our\r\nparty nearly made an end of these unfortunates before their officers\r\ncould interfere, for to the troops (Native and European alike) every\r\nman inside the walls of Delhi was looked upon as a rebel, worthy of\r\ndeath. These people, however, were unarmed, and it did not require\r\na very practised eye to see that they were inoffensive. We thought,\r\nhowever, that a good fright would do them no harm, and might possibly\r\nhelp us, so for a time we allowed them to believe that they were\r\nlooked upon as traitors, but eventually told them their lives would\r\nbe spared if they would take us in safety to some place from which\r\nwe might observe how the Lahore gate was guarded. After considerable\r\nhesitation and consultation amongst themselves they agreed to two of\r\ntheir party guiding Lang and me, while the rest remained as hostages,\r\nwith the understanding that, if we did not return within a given time,\r\nthey would be shot.\r\n\r\nOur trembling guides conducted us through houses, across courtyards,\r\nand along secluded alleys, without our meeting a living creature,\r\nuntil we found ourselves in an upper room of a house looking out on\r\nthe Chandni Chauk,[3] and within fifty yards of the Lahore gate.\r\n\r\nFrom the window of this room we could see beneath us the sepoys\r\nlounging about, engaged in cleaning their muskets and other\r\noccupations, while some, in a lazy sort of fashion, were acting as\r\nsentries over the gateway and two guns, one of which pointed in the\r\ndirection of the Sabzi Mandi, the other down the lane behind the\r\nramparts leading to the Burn bastion and Kabul gate. I could see from\r\nthe number on their caps that these sepoys belonged to the 5th Native\r\nInfantry.\r\n\r\nHaving satisfied ourselves of the feasibility of taking the Lahore\r\ngate in rear, we retraced our steps.\r\n\r\nThe two _banias_ behaved well throughout, but were in such a terrible\r\nfright of anything happening to us that they would not allow us to\r\nleave the shelter of one house until they had carefully reconnoitred\r\nthe way to the next, and made sure that it was clear of the enemy.\r\nThis occasioned so much delay that our friends had almost given us up,\r\nand were on the point of requiring the hostages to pay the penalty for\r\nthe supposed treachery of our guides, when we reappeared on the scene.\r\n\r\nWe then discussed our next move, and it was decided to repeat the\r\nmanoeuvre which had been so successful at the Burn bastion. The troops\r\nwere brought by the route we had just traversed, and drawn up behind a\r\ngateway next to the house in which we had been concealed. The gate was\r\nburst open, and rushing into the street, we captured the guns, and\r\nkilled or put to flight the sepoys whom we had watched from our upper\r\nchamber a short time before, without losing a man ourselves.\r\n\r\nThis was a great achievement, for we were now in possession of the\r\nmain entrance to Delhi, and the street of the city leading direct from\r\nthe Lahore gate to the palace and Jama Masjid. We proceeded up this\r\nstreet, at first cautiously, but on finding it absolutely empty, and\r\nthe houses on either side abandoned, we pushed on until we reached\r\nthe Delhi Bank. Here there was firing going on, and round shot flying\r\nabout from a couple of guns placed just outside the palace. But this\r\nwas evidently an expiring effort. The great Mahomedan mosque had just\r\nbeen occupied by a column under the command of Major James Brind;\r\nwhile Ensign McQueen,[4] of the 4th Punjab Infantry, with one of his\r\nown men had pluckily reconnoitred up to the chief gateway of the\r\npalace, and reported that there were but few men left in the Moghul\r\nfort.\r\n\r\nThe honour of storming this last stronghold was appropriately reserved\r\nfor the 60th Rifles, the regiment which had been the first to engage\r\nthe enemy on the banks of the Hindun, nearly four months before, and\r\nwhich throughout the siege had so greatly distinguished itself.\r\n\r\nHome, of the Engineers, the hero of the Kashmir gate exploit, first\r\nadvanced with some Sappers and blew in the outer gate. At this, the\r\nlast struggle for the capture of Delhi, I wished to be present, so\r\nattached myself for the occasion to a party of the 60th Rifles, under\r\nthe command of Ensign Alfred Heathcote. As soon as the smoke of\r\nthe explosion cleared away, the 60th, supported by the 4th Punjab\r\nInfantry, sprang through the gateway; but we did not get far, for\r\nthere was a second door beyond, chained and barred, which was with\r\ndifficulty forced open, when the whole party rushed in. The recesses\r\nin the long passage which led to the palace buildings were crowded\r\nwith wounded men, but there was very little opposition, for only a\r\nfew fanatics still held out. One of these--a Mahomedan sepoy in the\r\nuniform of a Grenadier of the 37th Native Infantry--stood quietly\r\nabout thirty yards up the passage with his musket on his hip. As we\r\napproached he slowly raised his weapon and fired, sending the bullet\r\nthrough McQueen's helmet. The brave fellow then advanced at the\r\ncharge, and was, of course, shot down. So ended the 20th September, a\r\nday I am never likely to forget.\r\n\r\nAt sunrise on the 21st a royal salute proclaimed that we were again\r\nmasters in Delhi, and that for the second time in the century the\r\ngreat city had been captured by a British force.\r\n\r\nLater in the day General Wilson established his Head-Quarters in the\r\nDewan-i-khas (the King's private hall of audience), and, as was in\r\naccordance with the fitness of things, the 60th Rifles and the Sirmur\r\nbattalion of Gurkhas[5] were the first troops of Her Majesty's army\r\nto garrison the palace of the Moghuls, in which the traitorous and\r\ntreacherous massacre of English men, women and children had been\r\nperpetrated.\r\n\r\nThe importance of securing the principal members of the Royal Family\r\nwas pressed upon the General by Chamberlain and Hodson, who both\r\nurged that the victory would be incomplete if the King and his male\r\nrelatives were allowed to remain at large. Wilson would not consent\r\nto any force being sent after them, and it was with considerable\r\nreluctance that he agreed to Hodson going on this hazardous duty with\r\nsome of his own men only. The last of the Moghul Emperors had taken\r\nrefuge in Humayun's tomb, about seven miles from Delhi, where, on the\r\nafternoon of the 21st, he surrendered to Hodson on receiving a promise\r\nfrom that officer that his own life and the lives of his favourite\r\nwife and her son should be spared. Hodson brought them all into Delhi\r\nand placed them under a European guard in a house in the Chandni\r\nChauk, thus adding one more to the many valuable services he had\r\nrendered throughout the siege.\r\n\r\nI went with many others the next day to see the King; the old man\r\nlooked most wretched, and as he evidently disliked intensely being\r\nstared at by Europeans, I quickly took my departure. On my way back I\r\nwas rather startled to see the three lifeless bodies of the King's two\r\nsons and grandson lying exposed on the stone platform in front of the\r\n_Kotwali_. On enquiry I learnt that Hodson had gone a second time\r\nto Humayun's tomb that morning with the object of capturing these\r\nPrinces, and on the way back to Delhi had shot them with his own\r\nhand--an act which, whether necessary or not, has undoubtedly cast a\r\nblot on his reputation. His own explanation of the circumstance was\r\nthat he feared they would be rescued by the mob, who could easily have\r\noverpowered his small escort of 100 sowars, and it certainly would\r\nhave been a misfortune had these men escaped. At the time a thirst for\r\nrevenge on account of the atrocities committed within the walls of\r\nDelhi was so great that the shooting of the Princes seemed to the\r\nexcited feelings of the army but an act of justice; and there were\r\nsome men, whose opinions were entitled to the greatest respect, who\r\nconsidered the safety of the British force would have been endangered\r\nby the escape of the representatives of the house of Taimur, and that\r\nfor this reason Hodson's act was justified.\r\n\r\nMy own feeling on the subject is one of sorrow that such a brilliant\r\nsoldier should have laid himself open to so much adverse criticism.\r\nMoreover, I do not think that, under any circumstances, he should\r\nhave done the deed himself, or ordered it to be done in that summary\r\nmanner, unless there had been evident signs of an attempt at a rescue.\r\n\r\nBut it must be understood that there was no breach of faith on\r\nHodson's part, for he steadily refused to give any promise to\r\nthe Princes that their lives should be spared; he did, however,\r\nundoubtedly by this act give colour to the accusations of\r\nblood-thirstiness which his detractors were not slow to make.\r\n\r\nThe news that we had occupied the palace, and were in complete\r\npossession of the city of Delhi, consoled Nicholson on his deathbed.\r\nFrom the first there was little hope that this valuable life could\r\nbe saved. He was taken into hospital in a fainting condition from\r\ninternal hemorrhage, and he endured excruciating agony; but, wrote\r\nGeneral Chamberlain, 'throughout those nine days of suffering he bore\r\nhimself nobly; not a lament or sigh ever passed his lips.' His every\r\nthought was given to his country, and to the last he materially aided\r\nthe military authorities by his clear-sighted, sound, and reliable\r\nadvice. His intellect remained unclouded to the end. With his latest\r\nbreath he sent messages of tender farewell to his mother, hoping she\r\nwould be patient under his loss, and to his oldest and dearest friend,\r\nHerbert Edwardes. After his death some frontier Chiefs and Native\r\nofficers of the Multani Horse were permitted to see him, and I was\r\ntold that it was touching beyond expression to see these strong men\r\nshed tears as they looked on all that was left of the leader they so\r\nloved and honoured.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus ended the great siege of Delhi, and to no one could the tidings\r\nof its fall have brought more intense relief and satisfaction than to\r\nthe Chief Commissioner of the Punjab. Although in the first instance\r\nSir John Lawrence certainly under-estimated the strength of the Delhi\r\ndefences and the difficulties with which General Anson had to contend,\r\nhe fully realized them later, and even at the risk of imperilling the\r\nsafety of his own province by denuding it of troops, he provided the\r\nmeans for the capture of the rebel stronghold, and consequently the\r\narmy of Delhi felt they owed him a deep debt of gratitude.\r\n\r\nLike Norman when writing his narrative of the siege, I feel I cannot\r\nconclude my brief account of it without paying my small tribute of\r\npraise and admiration to the troops who bore themselves so nobly from\r\nthe beginning to the end. Their behaviour throughout was beyond\r\nall praise, their constancy was unwearied, their gallantry most\r\nconspicuous; in thirty-two different fights they were victorious over\r\nlong odds, being often exposed to an enemy ten times their number,\r\nwho, moreover, had the advantage of ground and superior Artillery;\r\nthey fought and worked as if each one felt that on his individual\r\nexertions alone depended the issue of the day; they willingly, nay,\r\ncheerfully, endured such trials as few armies have ever been exposed\r\nto for so long a time. For three months, day after day, and for the\r\ngreater part of the day, every man had to be constantly under arms,\r\nexposed to a scorching Indian sun, which was almost as destructive as,\r\nand much harder to bear than, the enemy's never-ceasing fire. They saw\r\ntheir comrades struck down by cholera, sunstroke, and dysentery, more\r\ndispiriting a thousand times than the daily casualties in action.\r\nThey beheld their enemies reinforced while their own numbers rapidly\r\ndecreased. Yet they never lost heart, and at last, when it became\r\nevident that no hope of further reinforcements could be entertained,\r\nand that if Delhi were to be taken at all it must be taken at once,\r\nthey advanced to the assault with as high a courage and as complete a\r\nconfidence in the result, as if they were attacking in the first flush\r\nand exultation of troops at the commencement of a campaign, instead\r\nof being the remnant of a force worn out, by twelve long weeks of\r\nprivation and suffering, by hope deferred (which truly 'maketh the\r\nheart sick'), and by weary waiting for the help which never came.\r\nBatteries were thrown up within easy range of the walls, than which\r\na more heroic piece of work was never performed; and finally, these\r\ngallant few, of whom England should in very truth be everlastingly\r\nproud, stormed in the face of day a strong fortress defended by 30,000\r\ndesperate men, provided with everything necessary to defy assault.\r\n\r\nThe list of killed and wounded bears witness to the gallantry of all\r\narms of the service. The effective force at Delhi never amounted\r\nto 10,000 men. Of these 992 were killed and 2,845 wounded, besides\r\nhundreds who died of disease and exposure. Where all behaved nobly, it\r\nis difficult to particularize; but it will not, I hope, be considered\r\ninvidious if I specially draw my readers' attention to the four corps\r\nmost constantly engaged: the 60th Rifles, the Sirmur battalion of\r\nGurkhas, the Guides, and the 1st Punjab Infantry. Placed in the very\r\nfront of the position, they were incessantly under fire, and their\r\nlosses in action testify to the nature of the service they performed.\r\nThe 60th Rifles left Meerut with 440 of all ranks; a few days before\r\nthe assault they received a reinforcement of nearly 200, making a\r\ntotal of 640; their casualties were 389. The Sirmur battalion began\r\nwith 450 men, and were joined by a draft of 90, making a total of 540;\r\ntheir loss in killed and wounded amounted to 319. The strength of\r\nthe Guides when they joined was 550 Cavalry and Infantry, and their\r\ncasualties were 303. The 1st Punjab Infantry arrived in Delhi with\r\n3 British officers and 664 Natives of all ranks. Two of the British\r\nofficers were killed, and the third severely wounded, and of the\r\nNatives, 8 officers[6] and 200 men were killed and wounded; while out\r\nof the British officers attached to the regiment during the siege 1\r\nwas killed and 4 wounded. Further, it is a great pleasure to me to\r\ndwell on the splendid service done by the Artillery and Engineers. The\r\nformer, out of their small number, had 365 killed or disabled, and the\r\nlatter two-thirds of their officers and 293 of their men. I cannot\r\nmore appropriately conclude this chapter than by quoting the words of\r\nLord Canning, who, as Governor-General of India, wrote as follows in\r\ngiving publication to the Delhi despatches: 'In the name of outraged\r\nhumanity, in memory of innocent blood ruthlessly shed, and in\r\nacknowledgment of the first signal vengeance inflicted on the foulest\r\ntreason, the Governor-General in Council records his gratitude to\r\nMajor-General Wilson and the brave army of Delhi. He does so in the\r\nsure conviction that a like tribute awaits them, not in England only,\r\nbut wherever within the limits of civilization the news of their\r\nwell-earned triumph shall reach.'\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A report was circulated that a large number of our men\r\nhad fallen into the trap laid for them by the Native shopkeepers, and\r\nwere disgracefully drunk. I heard that a few men, overcome by heat and\r\nhard work, had given way to temptation, but I did not see a single\r\ndrunken man throughout the day of the assault, although, as I have\r\nrelated, I visited every position held by our troops within the walls\r\nof the city.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Sellers of grain and lenders of money.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: 'Silver Bazaar,' the main street of Delhi, in which\r\nwere, and still are, situated all the principal jewellers' and\r\ncloth-Merchants' shops.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Now Lieutenant-General Sir John McQueen, K.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The Gurkhas became such friends with the men of the 1st\r\nBattalion 60th Rifles during the siege--the admiration of brave men\r\nfor brave men--that they made a special request to be allowed to wear\r\nthe same uniform as their 'brothers' in the Rifles. This was acceded\r\nto, and the 2nd Gurkhas are very proud of the little red line on their\r\nfacings.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Amongst the Native officers killed was Subadar Ruttun\r\nSing, who fell mortally wounded in the glacis. He was a Patiala Sikh,\r\nand had been invalided from the service. As the 1st Punjab Infantry\r\nneared Delhi, Major Coke saw the old man standing in the road with two\r\nswords on. He begged to be taken back into the service, and when Coke\r\ndemurred he said: 'What! my old corps going to fight at Delhi without\r\nme! I hope you will let me lead my old Sikh company into action again.\r\nI will break these two swords in your cause.' Coke acceded to the old\r\nman's wish, and throughout the siege of Delhi he displayed the most\r\nsplendid courage. At the great attack on the 'Sammy House' on the 1st\r\nand 2nd August, when Lieutenant Travers of his regiment was killed,\r\nRuttun Sing, amidst a shower of bullets, jumped on to the parapet and\r\nshouted to the enemy, who were storming the piquet: 'If any man wants\r\nto fight, let him come here, and not stand firing like a coward! I\r\nam Ruttun Sing, of Patiala.' He then sprang down among the enemy,\r\nfollowed by the men of his company, and drove them off with heavy\r\nloss.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the assault the regiment had marched down to the\r\nrendezvous at Ludlow Castle, 'left in front.' While waiting for the\r\nArtillery to fire a few final rounds at the breaches, the men sat\r\ndown, and, falling in again, were doing so 'right in front.' Ruttun\r\nSing came up to Lieutenant Charles Nicholson, who was commanding the\r\nregiment, and said: 'We ought to fall in \"left in front,\" thereby\r\nmaking his own company the leading one in the assault. In a few\r\nminutes more Ruttun Sing was mortally wounded, and Dal Sing, the\r\nJemadar of his company, a man of as great courage as Ruttun Sing, but\r\nnot of the same excitable nature, was killed outright.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n1857\r\n\r\n  Necessity for further action--Departure from Delhi\r\n  --Action at Bulandshahr--Lieutenant Home's death--Knights-errant\r\n  --Fight at Aligarh--Appeals from Agra\r\n  --Collapse of the administration--Taken by surprise\r\n  --The fight at Agra--An exciting chase--The Taj Mahal\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fall of Delhi was loudly proclaimed, and the glad tidings spread\r\nlike wildfire throughout the length and breadth of India, bringing\r\nintense relief to Europeans everywhere, but more especially to those\r\nin the Punjab, who felt that far too great a strain was being put upon\r\nthe loyalty of the people, and that failure at Delhi would probably\r\nmean a rising of the Sikhs and Punjabis. Salutes were fired in\r\nhonour of the victory at all the principal stations, but the Native\r\npopulation of the Punjab could not at first be made to believe that\r\nthe Moghul capital, with its hordes of defenders, could have been\r\ncaptured by the small English army they saw marching through their\r\nprovince a few months before. Even at that time it seemed all too\r\nsmall for the task before it, and since then they knew it had dwindled\r\ndown to less than half its numbers. It was not, indeed, until they had\r\nocular demonstration of our success, in the shape of the loot which\r\nsome of the Native followers belonging to the besieging force took\r\nback to their homes, that they became convinced of the reality of our\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN TO ILLUSTRATE THE SIEGE OF DELHI, 1857]\r\n\r\nSir John Lawrence being painfully alive to the weakness of our\r\nposition in the Punjab, as compared to the great strength of the\r\nSikhs, on hearing the news of the capture of Delhi, begged General\r\nWilson to send back at once a British regiment as a practical proof\r\nthat our triumph was complete, and that he no longer needed so many\r\ntroops. But though the city was in our possession, a great deal\r\nremained to be done before a single soldier could be spared. Above all\r\nthings, it was necessary to open up communication with Cawnpore and\r\nLucknow, in order to ascertain exactly the state of affairs in that\r\npart of the country. We had heard of the failure of Havelock's\r\nattempts to reach Lucknow, and of his having been obliged in the end\r\nto retire to Cawnpore and wait for reinforcements, but we had not been\r\nable to learn whether such reinforcements had reached him, or how long\r\nthe beleaguered garrison of Lucknow was likely to hold out.\r\n\r\nNo time was wasted at Delhi. On the 21st September, the very day\r\nafter the palace was occupied, it was decided to despatch a column\r\nto Cawnpore; but, on account of the weakened condition of the whole\r\nforce, there was considerable difficulty in detailing the troops\r\nfor its composition. The total strength of the corps[1] eventually\r\nselected amounted to 750 British and 1,900 Native soldiers, with\r\nsixteen field-guns.\r\n\r\nNo officer of note or high rank being available, the command of the\r\ncolumn should have been given to the senior regimental officer serving\r\nwith it, viz., Colonel Hope Grant, of the 9th Lancers; but for some\r\nunexplained motive Lieutenant-Colonel Greathed, of the 8th Foot, was\r\nchosen by General Wilson. Captain Bannatyne, of the same regiment, was\r\nappointed his Brigade-Major, and I was sent with the column as Deputy\r\nAssistant-Quartermaster-General. On the fall of Delhi the whole of\r\nthe Head-Quarters staff returned to Simla, except Henry Norman, whose\r\nsoldierly instincts made him prefer accompanying the column, in order\r\nthat he might be ready to join Sir Colin Campbell, the newly-appointed\r\nCommander-in-Chief, who had shortly before arrived in India.\r\n\r\nNicholson's funeral was taking place as we marched out of Delhi, at\r\ndaybreak on the morning of the 24th September. It was a matter of\r\nregret to me that I was unable to pay a last tribute of respect to my\r\nloved and honoured friend and Commander by following his body to the\r\ngrave, but I could not leave the column. That march through Delhi in\r\nthe early morning light was a gruesome proceeding. Our way from the\r\nLahore gate by the Chandni Chauk led through a veritable city of\r\nthe dead; not a sound was to be heard but the falling of our own\r\nfootsteps; not a living creature was to be seen. Dead bodies\r\nwere strewn about in all directions, in every attitude that the\r\ndeath-struggle had caused them to assume, and in every stage of\r\ndecomposition. We marched in silence, or involuntarily spoke in\r\nwhispers, as though fearing to disturb those ghastly remains of\r\nhumanity. The sights we encountered were horrible and sickening to the\r\nlast degree. Here a dog gnawed at an uncovered limb; there a vulture,\r\ndisturbed by our approach from its loathsome meal, but too completely\r\ngorged to fly, fluttered away to a safer distance. In many instances\r\nthe positions of the bodies were appallingly life-like. Some lay with\r\ntheir arms uplifted as if beckoning, and, indeed, the whole scene was\r\nweird and terrible beyond description. Our horses seemed to feel the\r\nhorror of it as much as we did, for they shook and snorted in evident\r\nterror. The atmosphere was unimaginably disgusting, laden as it was\r\nwith the most noxious and sickening odours.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe the joy of breathing the pure air of the\r\nopen country after such a horrible experience; but we had not escaped\r\nuntainted. That night we had several cases of cholera, one of the\r\nvictims being Captain Wilde, the Commandant of the 4th Punjab\r\nInfantry. He was sent back to Delhi in a hopeless condition, it was\r\nthought, but he recovered, and did excellent work at the head of his\r\nfine regiment during the latter part of the campaign.\r\n\r\nAfter a march of eleven miles we reached Ghazi-uddin nagar, to find\r\nthe place deserted. We halted the next day. The baggage animals were\r\nout of condition after their long rest at Delhi; and it was necessary\r\nto overhaul their loads and get rid of the superfluous kit and plunder\r\nwhich the followers had brought away with them. We were accompanied\r\non our march by a few enterprising civilians, who had found their way\r\ninto Delhi the day after we took possession of the palace. Amongst\r\nthem was Alfred Lyall,[2] a schoolfellow of mine at Eton. He was\r\non his way to take up the appointment of Assistant-Magistrate at\r\nBulandshahr, where he was located when the Mutiny broke out. As\r\nwe rode along he gave me a most interesting little history of his\r\npersonal experiences during the early days of May, from the time when\r\nthe first symptoms of the coming storm were felt, until that when the\r\nsurrounding country rose _en masse_, and he and those with him had\r\nto seek shelter at Meerut. I should like to repeat his story for the\r\nbenefit of my readers, but I refrain, as it would lose so much by my\r\ntelling; and I hope that some day Sir Alfred Lyall may be induced to\r\ntell his own story in the picturesque and attractive language which is\r\nso well known and so much appreciated by the reading public.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of the 28th, Norman, Lyall, and I, marching with\r\nWatson's Cavalry, two or three miles in advance of the column, arrived\r\nat cross-roads, one leading to Bulandshahr, the other to Malagarh, a\r\nfort belonging to a Mahomedan of the name of Walidad Khan, who, when\r\nthe British rule was in abeyance, assumed authority over the district\r\nin the name of the Emperor of Delhi. We halted, and, having put out\r\nour piquets, lay down and waited for the dawn. From information\r\nobtained by the civil officers with the column, we suspected that\r\nlarge numbers of mutineers were collected in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nWe were not left long in doubt as to the correctness of our\r\nsurmisings, for we were soon rudely awakened by the rattle of shots\r\nexchanged between our vedettes and those of the enemy. Information was\r\nsent back at once to the advance guard and to our Commander, while we\r\nset to work to ascertain the enemy's exact position; this proved to be\r\nat Bulandshahr, and we were within a couple of miles of the main body.\r\n\r\nAs we advanced the rebel Cavalry fell back, and when we got under fire\r\nof their guns, our Horse Artillery came into action; our Infantry\r\ncoming up, found the enemy occupying an extremely strong position, in\r\nthe gaol and a walled serai at the entrance to the town, their left\r\nbeing covered by the enclosed gardens and ruined houses of the\r\ndeserted civil station, within which they were collected in\r\nconsiderable force. From these points they were driven by the 75th\r\nFoot, who, in a most dashing manner, captured two 9-pounder guns,\r\nwhile a third was taken by the Cavalry. The rebels then began to\r\nretreat, and were followed up by a small body of Cavalry, under\r\nDrysdale,[3] of the 9th Lancers, with whom were Sarel, of the same\r\nregiment, Augustus Anson of the 84th Foot, and myself. We soon became\r\nentangled in narrow streets, but at last found ourselves in a gateway\r\nleading out of the town, which was crowded with bullock-carts, flying\r\ntownspeople, and a number of the enemy, some on horseback, some on\r\nfoot. There we had hard fighting; Sarel was wounded in the act of\r\nrunning a sepoy through the body, the forefinger of his right hand\r\nbeing taken off by a bullet, which then passed through his left arm;\r\nAnson was surrounded by mutineers, and performed prodigies of valour,\r\nfor which he was rewarded with the Victoria Cross. I was riding a\r\nWaziri horse, which had belonged to John Nicholson, and as it had been\r\na great favourite of his, I had commissioned a friend to buy him for\r\nme at the sale of Nicholson's effects. He was naturally impetuous,\r\nand, being now greatly excited by the firing and confusion, plunged\r\nabout a good deal. He certainly was not a comfortable mount on that\r\nday, but all the same he saved my life. In the midst of the mêlée I\r\nobserved a sepoy taking deliberate aim at me, and tried to get at him,\r\nbut the crowd between him and me prevented my reaching him. He fired;\r\nmy frightened animal reared, and received in his head the bullet which\r\nwas intended for me.[4]\r\n\r\nThe work fell chiefly on the Cavalry and Horse Artillery. Major Ouvry,\r\nwho commanded them, must have been a proud man that day, for they\r\nbehaved splendidly. Two of Blunt's guns also, under an old Addiscombe\r\nfriend of mine named Cracklow, did excellent service. The 9th Lancers,\r\nunder Drysdale, performed wonders; and the three squadrons of Punjab\r\nCavalry, under their gallant young leaders, Probyn, Watson, and\r\nYounghusband, and the squadron of Hodson's Horse, under Hugh Gough,\r\nshowed of what good stuff they were made. Our casualties were 6 men\r\nkilled, 6 officers and 35 men wounded. The enemy's loss was 300.\r\nA large quantity of ammunition and baggage fell into our hands,\r\nincluding many articles plundered from European men and women.\r\n\r\nAfter the fight was over, the column passed through the town, and our\r\ncamp was pitched about a mile beyond, on the banks of the Kali Naddi.\r\nThe same afternoon Malagarh was reconnoitred, but was found to be\r\ndeserted, a satisfactory result of the morning's action, for the fort,\r\nif defended, would have given us some trouble to take. Walidad Khan\r\nevidently hoped to become a power in the district, for he had begun to\r\nmake gun-carriages, and we found roughly-cast guns on the lathes ready\r\nfor boring out. It was decided that Malagarh Fort, which was full of\r\narticles of every description taken from the English residents, should\r\nbe destroyed. Its demolition, however, took some time to effect, and\r\nas we could not move till transport came from Meerut to convey our\r\nwounded officers and men back to that place, the column halted at\r\nBulandshahr for four days.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 1st October the fort was blown up, and most\r\nunfortunately, while superintending the operation, Lieutenant Home was\r\nkilled.[5] The mine had been laid and the slow-match lighted, but the\r\nexplosion not following as quickly as was expected, Home thought the\r\nmatch must have gone out, and went forward again to relight it. At\r\nthat moment the mine blew up. His death was greatly felt in camp,\r\nhappening as it did when all the excitement of battle was over.\r\n\r\nWe left Bulandshahr, and said good-bye to Lyall on the 3rd October,\r\nfeeling that he was being placed in a position of considerable risk,\r\nthrown as he was on his own resources, with general instructions to\r\nre-establish the authority of the British Government. He was not,\r\nhowever, molested, and after two or three days he was joined by a\r\nsmall body of troops from Meerut. During the months that followed\r\nhe and his escort had several alarms and some smart skirmishes; for\r\nRohilkand, a large tract of country to the east of Bulandshahr, was\r\nheld by the rebels until the following spring, and Lyall's district\r\nwas constantly traversed by bodies of mutinous sepoys.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the same day we reached Khurja, a fair-sized\r\nMahomedan town, from which some of our Cavalry soldiers were\r\nrecruited. The first thing that met our eyes on arrival at this place\r\nwas a skeleton, ostentatiously placed against the side of a bridge\r\nleading to the encamping-ground; it was headless, and the bones were\r\nhacked and broken. It was pronounced by more than one doctor to be the\r\nskeleton of a European woman. This sight maddened the soldiery, who\r\ndemanded vengeance, and at one time it seemed that the town of Khurja\r\nwould have to pay the penalty for the supposed crime. The whole force\r\nwas greatly excited. At length calmer counsels prevailed. The people\r\nof the town protested their innocence, and expressed their anxiety to\r\nbe our humble servants; they were, as a whole, given the benefit of\r\nthe doubt, but some soldiers found in the town, belonging to regiments\r\nwhich had mutinied, were tried, and hanged or acquitted according to\r\nthe evidence given.\r\n\r\nSome excitement was caused on reaching camp by the appearance of a\r\nfakir seated under a tree close to where our tents were pitched. The\r\nman was evidently under a vow of silence, which Hindu devotees often\r\nmake as a penance for sin, or to earn a title to more than a fair\r\nshare of happiness in a future life. On our addressing him, the fakir\r\npointed to a small wooden platter, making signs for us to examine it.\r\nThe platter had been quite recently used for mixing food in, and\r\nat first there seemed to be nothing unusual about it. On closer\r\ninspection, however, we discovered that a detachable square of wood\r\nhad been let in at the bottom, on removing which a hollow became\r\nvisible, and in it lay a small folded paper, that proved to be a note\r\nfrom General Havelock, written in the Greek character, containing\r\nthe information that he was on his way to the relief of the Lucknow\r\ngarrison, and begging any Commander into whose hands the communication\r\nmight fall to push on as fast as possible to his assistance, as he\r\nsorely needed reinforcements, having few men and no carriage to speak\r\nof. This decided Greathed to proceed with as little delay as might be\r\nto Cawnpore.\r\n\r\nJust before we left Bulandshahr, a spy reported to me that an English\r\nlady was a prisoner in a village some twenty miles off, and that she\r\nwas anxious to be rescued. As on cross-examination, however, the story\r\ndid not appear to me to be very reliable, I told the man he must bring\r\nme some proof of the presence of the lady in the village. Accordingly,\r\non the arrival of the column at Khurja, he appeared with a piece of\r\npaper on which was written 'Miss Martindale.' This necessitated the\r\nmatter being inquired into, and I obtained the Brigadier's permission\r\nto make a detour to the village in question. I started off,\r\naccompanied by Watson and Probyn, with their two squadrons of Cavalry.\r\nWe timed our march so as to reach our destination just before dawn;\r\nthe Cavalry surrounded the village, and with a small escort we three\r\nproceeded up the little street to the house where the guide told us\r\nthe lady was confined. Not only was the house empty, but, with the\r\nexception of a few sick and bedridden old people, there was not a\r\nsoul in the village. There had evidently been a hasty retreat, which\r\npuzzled me greatly, as I had taken every precaution to ensure secrecy,\r\nfor I feared that if our intention to rescue the lady became known she\r\nwould be carried off. As day broke we searched the surrounding crops,\r\nand found the villagers and some soldiers hidden amongst them. They\r\none and all denied that there was the slightest truth in the story,\r\nand as it appeared a waste of time to further prosecute the fruitless\r\nsearch, we were on the point of starting to rejoin our camp, when\r\nthere was a cry from our troopers of '_Mem sahib hai!_' (Here is the\r\nlady), and presently an excessively dusky girl about sixteen years of\r\nage appeared, clad in Native dress. We had some difficulty in getting\r\nthe young woman to tell us what had happened; but on assuring her that\r\nno harm should be done to those with whom she was living, she told us\r\nthat she was the daughter of a clerk in the Commissioner's office at\r\nSitapur; that all her family had been killed when the rising took\r\nplace at that station, and that she had been carried off by a sowar to\r\nhis home. We asked her if she wished to come away with us. After some\r\nhesitation she declined, saying the sowar had married her (after the\r\nMahomedan fashion), and was kind to her, and she had no friends and\r\nrelations to go to. On asking her why she had sent to let us know she\r\nwas there, she replied that she thought she would like to join the\r\nBritish force, which she heard was in the neighbourhood, but on\r\nfurther reflection she had come to the conclusion it was best for\r\nher to remain where she was. After talking to her for some time, and\r\nmaking quite sure she was not likely to change her mind, we rode\r\naway, leaving her to her sowar, with whom she was apparently quite\r\ncontent.[6] I need hardly say we got unmercifully chaffed on our\r\nreturn to camp, when the result of our expedition leaked out.\r\n\r\nAt Somna, where we halted for the night, we heard that the Mahomedan\r\ninsurgents, the prisoners released from gaol, and the rebel Rajputs of\r\nthe neighbourhood, were prepared to resist our advance on Aligarh, and\r\nthat they expected to be aided by a large number of mutineers from\r\nDelhi. We came in sight of Aligarh shortly before daybreak on the 5th\r\nOctober. Our advance was stopped by a motley crowd drawn up before\r\nthe walls, shouting, blowing horns, beating drums, and abusing the\r\nFeringhis in the choicest Hindustani; but, so far as we could see,\r\nthere were no sepoys amongst them. The Horse Artillery coming up,\r\nthese valiant defenders quickly fled inside the city and closed the\r\ngates, leaving two guns in our possession. Thinking we should be sure\r\nto attack and take the place, they rushed through it to the other\r\nside, and made for the open country. But we had had enough of street\r\nfighting at Delhi. Our Cavalry and Artillery were divided into two\r\nparties, which moved round the walls, one to the right and the other\r\nto the left, and united in pursuit of the fugitives at the further\r\nside. We followed them for several miles. Some had concealed\r\nthemselves in the high crops, and were discovered by the Cavalry on\r\ntheir return march to camp. Ouvry formed a long line, and one by one\r\nthe rebels, starting up as the troopers rode through the fields, were\r\nkilled, while our loss was trifling.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Aligarh had apparently had a bad time of it under\r\nthe rebel rule, for they expressed much joy at the result of the\r\nmorning's work, and were eager in their proffers to bring in supplies\r\nfor our troops and to otherwise help us.\r\n\r\nIll as we could afford to weaken our column, it was so necessary\r\nto keep the main line of communication open, and put a stop to the\r\ndisorder into which the country had fallen, that it was decided to\r\nleave two companies of Punjabis at Aligarh, as a guard to the young\r\ncivilian who was placed in charge of the district.\r\n\r\nFourteen miles from Aligarh on the road to Cawnpore there lived two\r\nRajputs, twin brothers, who had taken such a prominent part in the\r\nrebellion that a price had been put on their heads, and for the future\r\npeace of the district it was considered necessary to capture them. In\r\norder to surprise them the more completely, it was given out that the\r\ncolumn was to march towards Agra, from which place disquieting news\r\nhad been received, while secret orders were issued to proceed towards\r\nCawnpore. The Cavalry went on in advance, and while it was still dark,\r\nsucceeded in surrounding the village of Akrabad, where dwelt the\r\nbrothers. In attempting to escape they were both killed, and three\r\nsmall guns were found in their house loaded and primed, but we had\r\narrived too suddenly to admit of their being used against us. We\r\ndiscovered besides a quantity of articles which must have belonged\r\nto European ladies--dresses, books, photographs, and knick-knacks\r\nof every description--which made us feel that the twins had richly\r\ndeserved their fate.\r\n\r\nWe halted on the 7th, and on the 8th marched across country to\r\nBryjgarh (a prettily situated village under a fortified hill), our\r\nobject being to get nearer to Agra, the reports from which place had\r\nbeen causing us anxiety, and likewise to put ourselves in a position\r\nto intercept the Rohilkand mutineers, who we were told were on their\r\nway to Lucknow.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had we got to Bryjgarh than we received information that the\r\ndetachment we had left behind at Aligarh was not likely to be left\r\nundisturbed, and at the same time an urgent call for assistance came\r\nfrom Agra, where a combined attack by insurgents from Gwalior, Mhow,\r\nand Delhi was imminent. Fifty of Hodson's Horse, under a European\r\nofficer, and a sufficient number of Infantry to make the detachment we\r\nhad left there up to 200, were at once despatched to Aligarh. It was\r\nclear, too, that the appeal from Agra must be responded to, for it\r\nwas an important place, the capital of the North-West Provinces; the\r\ntroops and residents had been shut up in the fort for more than\r\nthree months, and the letters, which followed each other in quick\r\nsuccession, showed that the authorities were considerably alarmed. It\r\nwas felt, therefore, that it was imperative upon us to turn our steps\r\ntowards Agra, but it entailed our marching forty-eight miles out\r\nof our way, and having to give up for the time any idea of aiding\r\nHavelock in the relief of Lucknow.\r\n\r\nThe column marched at midnight on the 8th October, the Horse Artillery\r\nand Cavalry, which I accompanied, pushing on as fast as possible. We\r\nhad done thirty-six miles, when we were advised from Agra that there\r\nwas no need for so much haste, as the enemy, having heard of our\r\napproach, were retiring; we accordingly halted, nothing loath, till\r\nthe Infantry came up.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning, the 10th October, we reached Agra. Crossing\r\nthe Jumna by a bridge of boats, we passed under the walls of the\r\npicturesque old fort built by the Emperor Akbar nearly 300 years\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nThe European residents who had been prisoners within the walls of the\r\nfort for so long streamed out to meet and welcome us, overjoyed at\r\nbeing free at last. We presented, I am afraid, but a sorry appearance,\r\nas compared to the neatly-dressed ladies and the spick-and-span troops\r\nwho greeted us, for one of the fair sex was overheard to remark, 'Was\r\never such a dirty-looking lot seen?' Our clothes were, indeed, worn\r\nand soiled, and our faces so bronzed that the white soldiers were\r\nhardly to be distinguished from their Native comrades.\r\n\r\nOur questions as to what had become of the enemy, who we had been\r\ninformed had disappeared with such unaccountable celerity on hearing\r\nof the advance of the column, were answered by assurances that there\r\nwas no need to concern ourselves about them, as they had fled across\r\nthe Kari Naddi, a river thirteen miles away, and were in full retreat\r\ntowards Gwalior. It was a little difficult to believe in the complete\r\ndispersion of the formidable rebel army, the mere rumoured approach\r\nof which had created such consternation in the minds of the Agra\r\nauthorities, and had caused the many urgent messages imploring us to\r\npush on.\r\n\r\nOur doubts, however, were met with the smile of superior knowledge.\r\nWe were informed that the rebels had found it impossible to get\r\ntheir guns across to the Agra side of the stream, and that, feeling\r\nthemselves powerless without them to resist our column, they had taken\r\nthemselves off with the least possible delay. We were asked with\r\nsome indignation, 'Had not the whole country round been scoured\r\nby thoroughly trustworthy men without a trace of the enemy being\r\ndiscovered?' And we were assured that we might take our much-needed\r\nrest in perfect confidence that we were not likely to be disturbed.\r\nWe were further told by those who were responsible for the local\r\nIntelligence Department, and who were repeatedly questioned, that they\r\nhad no doubt whatever their information was correct, and that there\r\nwas no need to follow up the enemy until our troops were rested and\r\nrefreshed.\r\n\r\nWe were then not aware of what soon became painfully apparent, that\r\nneither the information nor the opinions of the heads of the civil\r\nand military administration at Agra were to be relied upon. That\r\nadministration had, indeed, completely collapsed; there was no\r\ncontrolling authority; the crisis had produced no one in any\r\nresponsible position who understood the nature of the convulsion\r\nthrough which we were passing; and endless discussion had resulted (as\r\nmust always be the case) in fatal indecision and timidity.\r\n\r\nWe could hardly have been expected to know that the government of so\r\ngreat a province was in the hands of men who were utterly unfit to\r\ncope with the difficulties of an emergency such as had now arisen,\r\nalthough in quieter times they had filled their positions with credit\r\nto themselves and advantage to the State.\r\n\r\nThat this was the case can be proved beyond a doubt, but I do not give\r\nit as an excuse for our being caught napping by the enemy, which\r\nwe certainly were. We ought, of course, to have reconnoitred the\r\nsurrounding country for ourselves, and posted our piquets as usual;\r\nand we ought not to have been induced to neglect these essential\r\nmilitary precautions by the confident assertion of the Agra\r\nauthorities that the enemy were nowhere in our neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe Brigadier gave orders for our camp to be pitched as soon as the\r\ntents should arrive, but he saw no necessity for posting piquets\r\nuntil the evening. Accordingly, I marked out the camp on the brigade\r\nparade-ground, which had been selected as best suited for the\r\npurpose--a grassy, level, open spot, a mile and a half from the fort.\r\nOn the left and rear were the ruined lines of the two Native Infantry\r\nregiments which had been disarmed and sent to their homes, and the\r\ncharred remains of the British officers' houses. To the right and\r\nfront there was cultivation, and the high crops, almost ready to be\r\nreaped, shut out the view of the country beyond.\r\n\r\nAs the tents and baggage could not arrive for some time, I got leave\r\nto go with Norman, Watson, and a few others to breakfast in the fort.\r\nWe had scarcely sat down, bent on enjoying such an unusual event as a\r\nmeal in ladies' society, when we were startled by the report of a gun,\r\nthen another and another. Springing to our feet, there was a general\r\nexclamation of, 'What can it mean? Not the enemy, surely!' But the\r\nenemy it was, as we were soon convinced by our host, who, having gone\r\nto a point from which he could get a view of the surrounding country,\r\ncame back in hot haste, to tell us that an action was taking place.\r\n\r\nWe who belonged to the column hurried down the stairs, jumped on\r\nour horses, and galloped out of the fort and along the road in the\r\ndirection of the firing. We had got but half-way to camp, when we were\r\nmet and almost borne down by an enormous crowd, consisting of men,\r\nwomen, and children of every shade of colour, animals and baggage all\r\nmixed up in inextricable confusion. On they rushed, struggling and\r\nyelling as if pursued by demons.\r\n\r\nThe refugees from the fort, tired of their long imprisonment, had\r\ntaken advantage of the security which they thought was assured by the\r\narrival of the column to visit their deserted homes. Two-thirds of the\r\n150,000 inhabitants of the city had also flocked out to see the troops\r\nwho had taken part in the capture of Delhi (the report of which\r\nachievement was still universally disbelieved), to watch our camp\r\nbeing pitched, and to see what was going on generally. All this varied\r\ncrowd, in terror at the first sound of firing, made for the fort and\r\ncity, and were met in their flight by the heavy baggage of the\r\ncolumn on its way to camp. Instantly, elephants, camels, led horses,\r\ndoolie-bearers carrying the sick and wounded, bullocks yoked to\r\nheavily-laden carts, all becoming panic-stricken, turned round and\r\njoined in the stampede. Elephants, as terrified as their _mahouts_[7],\r\nshuffled along, screaming and trumpeting; drivers twisted the tails\r\nof their long-suffering bullocks with more than usual energy and\r\nheartlessness, in the vain hope of goading them into a gallop; and\r\ncamels had their nostrils rent asunder by the men in charge of them,\r\nin their unsuccessful endeavours to urge their phlegmatic animals into\r\nsomething faster than their ordinary stately pace.\r\n\r\nInto this surging multitude we rushed, but for a time our progress was\r\ncompletely checked. Eventually, however, by dint of blows, threats,\r\nand shouts, we managed to force our way through the motley crowd and\r\nreach the scene of action. What a sight was that we came upon! I seem\r\nto see it now as distinctly as I did then. Independent fights were\r\ngoing on all over the parade-ground. Here, a couple of Cavalry\r\nsoldiers were charging each other. There, the game of bayonet _versus_\r\nsword was being carried on in real earnest. Further on, a party of\r\nthe enemy's Cavalry were attacking one of Blunt's guns (which they\r\nsucceeded in carrying off a short distance). Just in front, the 75th\r\nFoot (many of the men in their shirt-sleeves) were forming square to\r\nreceive a body of the rebel horse. A little to the left of the 75th,\r\nRemmington's troop of Horse Artillery and Bourchier's battery\r\nhad opened fire from the park without waiting to put on their\r\naccoutrements, while the horses were being hastily harnessed by the\r\nNative drivers and _saices_. Still further to the left, the 9th\r\nLancers and Gough's squadron of Hodson's Horse were rapidly saddling\r\nand falling in. On the right the 8th Foot and the 2nd and 4th Punjab\r\nInfantry were busy getting under arms, while beyond, the three\r\nsquadrons of Punjab Cavalry, under Probyn and Younghusband, were\r\nhurrying to get on the enemy's flank.\r\n\r\nWatson galloped off to take command of the Punjab Cavalry, and Norman\r\nand I rode in different directions to search for the Brigadier. While\r\nthus employed, I was stopped by a dismounted _sowar_, who danced about\r\nin front of me, waving his _pagri_[8] before the eyes of my horse with\r\none hand, and brandishing his sword with the other. I could not get\r\nthe frightened animal near enough to use my sword, and my pistol (a\r\nDeane and Adams revolver), with which I tried to shoot my opponent,\r\nrefused to go off, so I felt myself pretty well at his mercy, when, to\r\nmy relief, I saw him fall, having been run through the body by a man\r\nof the 9th Lancers who had come to my rescue.\r\n\r\nBeing unable to find the Brigadier, I attached myself to the next\r\nsenior officer, Major Frank Turner, who commanded the Artillery.\r\nGradually the enemy were beaten off, and the troops formed themselves\r\nup ready for pursuit, or whatever they might be called upon to do. At\r\nthis juncture Greathed appeared on the ground.\r\n\r\nWith less experienced troops the surprise--and a thorough surprise it\r\nwas--would in all probability have had serious results. Most of the\r\nmen were asleep under the few tents which had already arrived, or such\r\nshelter as could be obtained near at hand, when first one round shot,\r\nthen another, came right into their midst from a battery concealed\r\nin the high crops to our right front. At the same time half a dozen\r\nrebels, one of them playing the _nagàra_,[9] rode quietly up to the\r\nQuarter-Guard of the 9th Lancers and cut down the sentry. Being\r\ndressed, like Probyn's men, in red, they were mistaken for them, and\r\nwere thus enabled to get close to the guard. This act was quickly\r\nfollowed by a general rush of the enemy's Cavalry, which brought about\r\nthe series of fights that were going on when we appeared on the scene.\r\nThe Commander was not to be found; no one knew who was the senior\r\nofficer present; consequently each regiment and battery had to act\r\naccording to its own discretion. The troops got ready with incredible\r\nrapidity, and set to work to drive the enemy off the ground. The\r\nArtillery replied to the insurgents' guns; the Infantry did what they\r\ncould, but were hampered by the fear of doing more injury to their\r\nfriends than their foes, and thus the brunt of the work fell upon the\r\nCavalry. The 9th Lancers made a succession of brilliant charges. One\r\ntroop especially distinguished itself by recovering Blunt's captured\r\ngun; the Captain (French) was killed, and the subaltern (Jones),\r\ncovered with wounds, was left on the ground for dead. Watson, Probyn,\r\nand Younghusband, with their three squadrons, cleared our right flank,\r\ncapturing two guns and some standards; and Hugh Gough, with his\r\nsquadron, performed a similar duty on the left.\r\n\r\nProbyn greatly distinguished himself on this occasion. In one of the\r\ncharges he got separated from his men, and was for a time surrounded\r\nby the enemy, two of whom he slew. In another charge he captured a\r\nstandard. For these and numerous acts of gallantry during the Mutiny,\r\nhe was, to the great delight of his many friends in the column,\r\nawarded the Victoria Cross.\r\n\r\nWhen Greathed arrived, the order for a general advance was given,\r\nand we were just moving off in pursuit of the rebels, when the\r\n3rd European Regiment and a battery of Field Artillery under\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Cotton arrived from the fort. This officer, being\r\nsenior to our Brigadier, took command of the force, and untimely\r\ndelay was caused while he learnt the details of our position. Having\r\nsatisfied himself that the enemy must be followed up, he endorsed\r\nGreathed's order, and off we again started.\r\n\r\nWe soon overtook the retreating foe, who every now and then turned and\r\nmade an ineffectual stand. At the end of about four miles we came upon\r\ntheir camp; it covered a considerable space, and must have taken\r\na long time to transport and pitch--a circumstance which made the\r\nignorance on the part of the Agra authorities as to the close\r\nproximity of the enemy appear even more unaccountable than before.\r\n\r\nOur Infantry were now pretty well done up; they had been on the move,\r\nwith one or two short intervals, for nearly sixty hours, and the 3rd\r\nEuropeans were not in trim for a long and hot day's work after such a\r\nlengthened period of inactivity in the fort, and clad, as they were,\r\nin thick scarlet uniform. The enemy, however, could not be allowed to\r\ncarry off their guns; so, leaving the Infantry to amuse themselves by\r\nmaking hay in the rebels' camp, we pushed forward with the Cavalry and\r\nArtillery. It was a most exciting chase. Property of all sorts and\r\ndescriptions fell into our hands, and before we reached the Kari Naddi\r\nwe had captured thirteen guns, some of them of large calibre, and a\r\ngreat quantity of ammunition. The enemy's loss on this occasion was\r\nnot very great, owing to the extraordinary facility with which Native\r\ntroops can break up and disappear, particularly when crops are on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nWhile watching a few of the rebel Cavalry making their escape along\r\nthe opposite bank of the Kari Naddi, I noticed about a dozen men\r\nbelonging to the 2nd and 4th Punjab Infantry quenching their thirst in\r\nthe stream. Carried away by excitement, they had managed to keep up\r\nwith the pursuit, never thinking of the inevitable trudge back to\r\nAgra, which meant that, by the time they arrived there, they would\r\nhave accomplished a march of not less than 70 miles without a halt,\r\nbesides having had a severe fight with an enemy greatly superior in\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nOur casualties were slight: 12 officers and men were killed, 54\r\nwounded, and 2 missing, besides some 20 camp-followers killed and\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the enemy were almost as much taken by surprise\r\nas we were. They knew that we were on our way from Aligarh, and had\r\narranged (as we afterwards heard) with the people of the city to\r\ndestroy the bridge of boats in time to prevent our crossing. But our\r\nmovements were sufficiently rapid to prevent their carrying their\r\nintention into effect; and although the insurgents were informed that\r\nwe had actually crossed the river they refused to believe the report,\r\nand, it was said, hanged the man who brought it. Their incredulity was\r\nstrengthened by the small dimensions of the ground taken up for our\r\ncamp, and the few tents which were pitched, and they made up their\r\nminds that these were only being prepared for the troops belonging\r\nto the Agra garrison, and so anticipated an easy victory. Their\r\nastonishment first became known when they were repulsed by the 75th\r\nFoot, and were heard to say to one another, '_Arrah bhai! ye Diliwhale\r\nhain!_' (I say, brother! these are the fellows from Delhi!).\r\n\r\nWe halted at Agra on the 11th, 12th, and 13th October, partly to\r\nrest the men and transport animals, but chiefly on account of the\r\ndifficulty we had in getting out of the clutches of the North-West\r\nProvinces Government, the local authorities not caring to be left to\r\ntheir own resources. Our wounded were taken to the fort, and lodged in\r\nthe Moti Masjid,[10] which exquisite little building had been turned\r\ninto a hospital. The men were well taken care of by the ladies, who\r\nseemed to think they could never do enough for the Delhi column.\r\n\r\nI now for the first time saw the lovely Taj Mahal--that beautiful,\r\nworld-famed memorial of a man's devotion to a woman, a husband's\r\nundying love for a dead wife. I will not attempt to describe the\r\nindescribable. Neither words nor pencil could give to the most\r\nimaginative reader the slightest idea of the all-satisfying beauty and\r\npurity of this glorious conception. To those who have not already\r\nseen it, I would say: 'Go to India. The Taj alone is well worth the\r\njourney.'\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Two troops of Horse Artillery, with four guns and one\r\nhowitzer each, commanded respectively by Captains Remmington and\r\nBlunt.

Instead of acting on his own convictions,\r\nhe allowed himself to be entirely led by men about him, who had not\r\nsufficient knowledge of Natives to enable them to grasp how completely\r\nthe latter's attitude towards us had been changed by the loss of our\r\nmilitary hold over the country.[1]\r\n\r\nDeaf to warnings from those who did understand the magnitude of the\r\ndanger, the Lieutenant-Governor refused to listen to the Maharaja\r\nScindia, who, influenced by the wise counsels of his astute and\r\nenlightened minister, Dinkar Rao, told him that the whole Native army\r\nwas disloyal, and that the men of his own (the Gwalior) Contingent[2]\r\nwere as bad as the rest. The authorities refused to allow the ladies\r\nand children at Gwalior to be sent into Agra for safety; they objected\r\nto arrangements being made for accommodating the non-combatants inside\r\nthe walls of the fort, because, forsooth, such precautions would show\r\na want of confidence in the Natives! and the sanction for supplies\r\nbeing stored in the fort was tardily and hesitatingly accorded. It was\r\nnot, indeed, until the mutinous sepoys from Nimach and Nasirabad were\r\nwithin sixty miles of Agra that orders were given to put the fort in\r\na state of defence and provision it, and it was not until they had\r\nreached Futtehpore Sikri, twenty-three miles from Agra, that the women\r\nand children were permitted to seek safety within the stronghold.[3]\r\n\r\nFortunately, however, notwithstanding the intermittent manner in which\r\ninstructions were issued, there was no scarcity of supplies, for,\r\nowing to the foresight and energy of Lieutenant Henry Chalmers,\r\nthe executive Commissariat officer, assisted by that prince of\r\ncontractors, Lalla Joti Persâd, and ably supported by Mr. Reade, the\r\ncivilian next in rank to the Lieutenant-Governor, food was stored in\r\nsufficient quantities, not only for the garrison, but for all the\r\nrefugees from the surrounding districts.[4]\r\n\r\nMr. Drummond, the magistrate of the district, who had from the first\r\nbeen the chief opponent of precautionary measures for the security of\r\nthe residents, had the audacity to set the Lieutenant-Governor's order\r\nfor victualling the fort at defiance. He forbad grain or provisions\r\nbeing sold to the Commissariat contractor, whose duty it was to\r\ncollect supplies, and positively imprisoned one man for responding to\r\nthe contractor's demands. It was at this official's instigation that\r\nthe Native police force was largely increased, instead of being done\r\naway with altogether, as would have been the sensible course; and\r\nas there was an insufficiency of weapons wherewith to arm the\r\naugmentation, a volunteer corps of Christians, lately raised, was\r\ndisbanded, and their arms distributed amongst the Mahomedan police. So\r\nfar was this infatuated belief in the loyalty of the Natives carried\r\nthat it was proposed to disarm the entire Christian population, on the\r\npretext that their carrying weapons gave offence to the Mahomedans! It\r\nwas only on the urgent remonstrance of some of the military officers\r\nthat this preposterous scheme was abandoned.[5] The two Native\r\nregiments stationed at Agra were not disarmed until one of the British\r\nofficers with them had been killed and another wounded. The gaol,\r\ncontaining 5,000 prisoners, was left in charge of a Native guard,\r\nalthough the superintendent, having reliable information that the\r\nsepoys intended to mutiny, begged that it might be replaced by\r\nEuropean soldiers. The Lieutenant-Governor gave his consent to this\r\nwise precaution, but afterwards not only allowed himself to be\r\npersuaded to let the Native guard remain, but authorized the\r\nremoval of the European superintendent, on the plea of his being an\r\nalarmist.[6]\r\n\r\nOn the 4th July Mr. Colvin, the Lieutenant-Governor, whose health had\r\nbeen very indifferent for some time, was induced, much against his\r\nwill, to retire to the fort, and for the time being the management of\r\naffairs passed into the hands of Brigadier Polwhele. There was little\r\nimprovement--indecision reigned supreme. Notwithstanding that the\r\ngradual approach of the mutineers from Gwalior and Nasirabad was well\r\nknown, no preparations were made, no plan of action decided upon.\r\nPolwhele, who was a brave old soldier, and had seen a great deal of\r\nservice, had, indeed, wisely come to the conclusion that the rebels\r\nwould never venture to attack a fort like Agra, and that, if left\r\nalone, they would in all probability continue their march towards\r\nDelhi. The available troops numbered less than 1,000 effective men,\r\nand Polwhele felt that, by going out to attack the enemy, there would\r\nbe a grave risk of the seat of government falling into the hands of\r\nthe disaffected police and city people.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, the Brigadier allowed himself to be overruled,\r\nand when the mutineers were reported to have arrived at Shahganj, four\r\nmiles from Agra, he gave way to the cry to 'Go out and do something!'\r\nand issued orders for the troops to fall in.\r\n\r\nA series of mishaps then occurred. It was one o'clock in the afternoon\r\nof the 5th July before the column[7] was ready to start; the men in\r\ntheir thick red uniform suffered greatly from the heat and thirst; the\r\nenemy, 9,000 strong, with twelve guns, instead of being at Shahganj,\r\nwere found to be strongly entrenched at Sarsia, some distance farther\r\noff. A protracted engagement then took place, and our troops, having\r\nexpended all their ammunition, were obliged to retreat, leaving many\r\ndead and a gun on the field.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the city and cantonment were in a state of uproar. The first\r\ngun was the signal for the guard at the gaol to release the 5,000\r\nprisoners, who, as they appeared in the streets, still wearing their\r\nfetters, caused a perfect panic amongst the respectable inhabitants;\r\nwhile the evil-disposed made for the cantonment, to plunder, burn, and\r\nmurder. Some of the residents who had not sought shelter in the fort,\r\nconfident that our troops would gain an easy victory, on hearing of\r\ntheir defeat hurried with all speed to that place of refuge, and for\r\nthe most part succeeded in reaching it; but a few were overtaken and\r\nkilled by the mob, aided by the trusted police, who had early in the\r\nday broken into open mutiny.[8]\r\n\r\nWith one or two exceptions the officials, military and civil alike,\r\nwere utterly demoralized by all these disastrous occurrences, the\r\nresult of their own imbecility. For two days no one was allowed\r\nto leave the fort or approach from the outside. Within was dire\r\nconfusion; without, the mob had it all their own way.\r\n\r\nEarly in August a despatch was received from the Governor-General\r\nacknowledging the receipt of the report on the fight of the 5th July,\r\nand directing that Brigadier Polwhele should be removed from the\r\ncommand of his brigade. On the 9th September Mr. Colvin died; he\r\nnever recovered the shock of the Mutiny. As a Lieutenant-Governor\r\nin peace-time he was considered to have shown great ability in the\r\nmanagement of his province, and he was highly respected for his\r\nuprightness of character. One cannot but feel that it was in a great\r\nmeasure due to his failing health that, when the time of trial came,\r\nhe was unable to accept the responsibility of directing affairs\r\nhimself, or to act with the promptitude and decision which were\r\ndemanded from all those occupying prominent positions in 1857.\r\n\r\nMr. Reade, the next senior civilian, assumed charge of the government\r\non Mr. Colvin's death, until orders were received from the Government\r\nof India vesting the supreme authority in a military officer, and\r\nappointing Colonel Hugh Fraser, of the Bengal Engineers, to be Mr.\r\nColvin's successor with the rank and position of a Chief Commissioner.\r\nLord Canning was doubtless induced to make this selection in\r\nconsequence of the courage and ability Colonel Fraser had displayed\r\nduring the Burmese War, and also on account of the sound advice he\r\nhad given to the Lieutenant-Governor in the early days of the\r\noutbreak--advice which unfortunately was ignored. Mr. Reade, who had\r\nproved himself worthy of his high position, gave Colonel Fraser\r\nhis cordial and unqualified support, but that officer, like his\r\npredecessor, was in bad health, and found it difficult to exercise the\r\nmuch-needed control. A constant state of panic continued to exist, and\r\nno reliable information could be obtained of what was going on even in\r\nthe immediate neighbourhood. The relief afforded by the news of the\r\nfall of Delhi was great, but short-lived, for it was quickly followed\r\nby a report that the whole rebel army had fled from Delhi and was\r\nhastening towards Agra, and that the mutineers from Gwalior and\r\nCentral India were advancing to attack the fort. Again all was\r\nconfusion. Reports as to the movements of the enemy were never the\r\nsame for two days together; at last what appeared to be authentic\r\nintelligence was received: the Gwalior troops were said to be close\r\nat hand, and those urgent appeals for assistance which were sent to\r\nGreathed caused us to turn our steps towards Agra.\r\n\r\nOur object having been attained, we were all anxious to depart. The\r\nChief Commissioner, however, was quite as anxious that we should\r\nremain; firmly believing that the Gwalior troops would reappear, he\r\nsuggested that we should follow them up at least as far as Dholpur;\r\nbut this proposal Greathed firmly refused to accede to. The orders he\r\nhad received were to open up the country[9] between the Jumna and\r\nthe Ganges, and he had not forgotten the little note from Havelock\r\ndiscovered in the fakir's platter.\r\n\r\nAt last the column was allowed to leave. The evening before our\r\ndeparture Norman and I called on the Chief Commissioner to say\r\ngood-bye. We found Colonel Fraser greatly depressed, and inclined\r\nto take a most gloomy view of the situation, evidently thinking the\r\nrestoration of our rule extremely doubtful. His last words to us were,\r\n'We shall never meet again.'[10] He looked extremely ill, and his\r\nstate of health probably accounted for his gloomy forebodings. We, on\r\nthe contrary, were full of health and hope. Having assisted at the\r\ncapture of Delhi, the dispersion of the enemy who had attempted to\r\noppose us on our way through the Doab, and the troops we were serving\r\nwith having recently achieved a decisive victory at Agra over a foe\r\nfour times their number, we never doubted that success would attend\r\nus in the future as in the past, and we were now only anxious to\r\njoin hands with Havelock, and assist in the relief of the sufferers\r\nbesieged in Lucknow.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 'They regarded the Mutiny as a military revolt; the rural\r\ndisturbances as the work of the mobs. The mass of the people they\r\nconsidered as thoroughly loyal, attached to our rule as well from\r\ngratitude as from self-interest, being thoroughly conscious of the\r\nbenefits it had conferred upon them. Holding these opinions, they did\r\nnot comprehend either the nature or the magnitude of the crisis. To\r\ntheir inability to do so, many lives and much treasure were needlessly\r\nsacrificed.'--'The Indian Mutiny,' Thornhill.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The Gwalior Contingent was raised in 1844, after the\r\nbattles of Punniar and Maharajpore, to replace the troops of Maharaja\r\nScindia ordered to be reduced.

Our camp was pitched in a\r\npretty garden called the Rambagh, only a short distance from Agra,\r\nwhere we gave a picnic to the ladies who had been so kind to our\r\nwounded men--a rough sort of entertainment, as may be imagined, but\r\nmuch enjoyed by the easily-pleased people who had been prisoners for\r\nso long, to whom the mere getting away from the fort for a few hours\r\nwas a relief.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 15th we commenced our march towards Mainpuri, a\r\nsmall station seventy miles from Agra, which we reached on the 18th.\r\nWhile on our way there, Hope Grant, Colonel of the 9th Lancers,\r\narrived in camp to take over the command of the column. He had\r\nremained at Delhi when superseded by Greathed, and being naturally\r\nindignant at the treatment he had received, he protested against it,\r\nand succeeded in getting the order appointing Greathed to the command\r\ncancelled.\r\n\r\nHad an officer been specially selected on account of his possessing\r\na more intimate acquaintance with Native soldiers and a longer\r\nexperience of India, Hope Grant would no doubt have accepted the\r\ninevitable. But Greathed did not know as much of the country and\r\nNative troops as Hope Grant did; he had seen no service before he\r\ncame to Delhi, and while there had no opportunity of showing that he\r\npossessed any particular qualification for command; he certainly did\r\nnot exhibit any while in charge of the column, and everyone in the\r\nforce was pleased to welcome Hope Grant as its leader.\r\n\r\nThe Raja of Mainpuri, who had openly joined the rebels, fled the day\r\nbefore we marched in, leaving behind him several guns and a quantity\r\nof powder. We halted on the 20th, blew up his fort and destroyed the\r\npowder. The European part of the station was in ruins, but a relation\r\nof the Raja had been able to prevent the Government treasury from\r\nbeing plundered, and he made over to us two and a half lakhs of\r\nrupees.\r\n\r\nThe civilians of the Mainpuri district were amongst the refugees at\r\nAgra, and took advantage of our escort to return to their station.\r\nWe had also been joined by some officers whom the mutiny of their\r\nregiments had left without employment; they were a welcome addition\r\nto our Punjab regiments, as the limited number of British officers\r\nattached to these corps had been considerably reduced by the\r\nconstantly recurring casualties. One of these officers was a Captain\r\nCarey, whose story, as he told it to me, of his escape from the\r\nmassacre at Cawnpore and his subsequent experiences is, I think, worth\r\nrepeating.\r\n\r\nIn the month of May Carey went into Wheeler's entrenchment with the\r\nrest of the garrison; a few days before the investment, however, Sir\r\nHenry Lawrence sent his Military Secretary, Captain Fletcher Hayes, to\r\nCawnpore, to report on what course events were taking at that place,\r\nand, if possible, to communicate with Delhi. His escort was the 2nd\r\nOudh Irregular Cavalry. Hayes had already made Carey's acquaintance,\r\nand, on finding him at Cawnpore, asked him to accompany him to Delhi,\r\nwhich invitation Carey gladly accepted. When they got close to Bewar,\r\nwhere the road to Mainpuri branched off, Hayes, wishing to gain\r\ninformation from the civil authorities as to the state of the country\r\nthrough which their route to Delhi lay, rode off to the latter place\r\nwith Carey, having first ordered the escort to proceed towards Delhi,\r\nand having arranged with the British officers to catch them up at the\r\nend of the next day's march. The following day, as the two friends\r\napproached the encamping ground where they were to overtake the\r\nescort, they beheld the regiment marching steadily along the road\r\nin regular formation; there was nothing to warn them that it had\r\nrevolted, for as there were only three British officers with the\r\ncorps, whose dress was almost the same as the men's, their absence was\r\nnot noticed.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, when they had got within two or three hundred yards of the\r\nregiment, the troopers with one accord broke into shouts and yells,\r\nand, brandishing their swords, galloped towards Hayes and Carey,\r\nwho, turning their horses, made with all possible speed back towards\r\nMainpuri. Hayes, who was an indifferent rider, was soon overtaken and\r\ncut to pieces, while Carey, one of the best horsemen in the army,\r\nand beautifully mounted, escaped; the _sowars_ followed him for some\r\ndistance, but a wide irrigation cut, which he alone was able to clear,\r\nput an end to the pursuit. Carey reached his destination in safety,\r\nand, with the other Europeans from Mainpuri, sought refuge in the Agra\r\nfort, where he spent the following five months. It was afterwards\r\nascertained that the three British officers with the escort had been\r\nmurdered by the _sowars_ shortly before Hayes and Carey came in sight.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st October we reached Bewar, the junction of the roads from\r\nMeerut, Agra, Fatehgarh, and Cawnpore, at which point the Brigadier\r\nreceived a communication from Sir James Outram, written in Greek\r\ncharacter, from the Lucknow Residency, begging that aid might be sent\r\nas soon as possible, as provisions were running short.[1] The note was\r\nrolled up inside a quill, which the Native messenger had cunningly\r\nconcealed in the heart of his thick walking-stick. Outram's urgent\r\nsummons determined the Brigadier to push on. So the next day we made\r\na march of twenty-eight miles to Goorsahaigunj, and on the 23rd we\r\nreached Miran-ki-Serai, close to the ruined Hindu city of Kanoj.\r\n\r\nThe same day I went on as usual with a small escort to reconnoitre,\r\nand had passed through the town, when I was fired upon by a party of\r\nthe rebels, consisting of some 300 Cavalry, 500 Infantry, and four\r\nguns, who, having heard of the approach of the column, were trying to\r\nget away before it arrived. Their Cavalry and Infantry were on the\r\nopposite bank of a fairly wide stream, called the Kali Naddi, through\r\nwhich were being dragged some heavy pieces of cannon. I retired\r\na short distance, and sent back word to the advance guard, which\r\nhastened to my assistance. A few rounds from our Artillery caused the\r\nenemy to abandon their guns, the Infantry dispersed and disappeared,\r\nthe Cavalry fled, and we, crossing the stream, had a smart gallop\r\nafter them for about four miles over a fine grassy plain. On we flew,\r\nProbyn's and Watson's squadrons leading the way in parallel lines,\r\nabout a mile apart. I was with the latter, and we had a running fight\r\ntill we reached the Ganges, into which plunged those of the _sowars_\r\nwhom we had not been able to overtake; we reined up, and saw the\r\nunlucky fugitives struggling in the water, men and horses rolling over\r\neach other; they were gradually carried down by the swiftly running\r\nstream, and but a very few reached the opposite bank.\r\n\r\nOur casualties were trifling, only some half-dozen men wounded, while\r\nmy horse got a gash on his quarter from a sabre. Watson had the\r\nforefinger of his right hand badly cut in an encounter with a young\r\n_sowar_; I chaffed him at allowing himself to be nearly cut down by a\r\nmere boy, upon which he laughingly retorted: 'Well, boy or not, he was\r\nbigger than you.'\r\n\r\nIt was on this occasion that I first recognized the advantage of\r\nhaving the carbine slung on the trooper's back while in action,\r\ninstead of being carried in the bucket, as is the custom with our\r\nBritish Cavalry. Several of the enemy's loose horses were going about\r\nwith carbines on their saddles, while their dismounted riders were at\r\nan enormous disadvantage in trying to defend themselves from their\r\nmounted adversaries with only their swords. I saw, too, one of\r\nWatson's men saved from a fierce cut across the spine by having his\r\ncarbine on his back. More recent experience has quite satisfied me\r\nthat this is the only way this weapon should be carried when actual\r\nfighting is going on.\r\n\r\nThree more marches brought us to Cawnpore, where we arrived on the\r\n26th October.\r\n\r\nWe now for the first time heard the miserable 'story of Cawnpore.' We\r\nwere told how, owing to Sir Hugh Wheeler's misplaced belief in the\r\nloyalty of the sepoys, with whom he had served for upwards of half a\r\ncentury, and to the confiding old soldier's trust in the friendship of\r\nthe miscreant Nana, and in the latter's ability to defend him until\r\nsuccour should arrive, he had neglected to take precautionary measures\r\nfor laying in supplies or for fortifying the two exposed barracks\r\nwhich, for some unaccountable reason, had been chosen as a place of\r\nrefuge, instead of the easily defensible and well-stored magazine. Our\r\nvisit to this scene of suffering and disaster was more harrowing than\r\nit is in the power of words to express; the sights which met our eyes,\r\nand the reflections they gave rise to, were quite maddening, and could\r\nnot but increase tenfold the feelings of animosity and desire for\r\nvengeance which the disloyalty and barbarity of the mutineers in other\r\nplaces had aroused in the hearts of our British soldiers. Tresses of\r\nhair, pieces of ladies' dresses, books crumpled and torn, bits of work\r\nand scraps of music, just as they had been left by the wretched owners\r\non the fatal morning of the 27th June, when they started for that\r\nterrible walk to the boats provided by the Nana as the bait to induce\r\nthem to capitulate.[2] One could not but picture to one's self the\r\nawful suffering those thousand Christian souls of both sexes and\r\nof all ages must have endured during twenty-one days of misery and\r\nanxiety, their numbers hourly diminished by disease, privation, the\r\nterrific rays of a June sun, and the storm of shot, shell, and bullets\r\nwhich never ceased to be poured into them. When one looked on the\r\nruined, roofless barracks, with their hastily constructed parapet and\r\nditch (a mere apology for a defence), one marvelled how 465 men, not\r\nmore than half of them soldiers by profession, could have held out\r\nfor three long weeks against the thousands of disciplined troops and\r\nhordes of armed retainers whom the Nana was able to bring to the\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe the feelings with which we looked on the\r\nSati-Choura Ghat, where was perpetrated the basest of all the Nana's\r\nbase acts of perfidy;[3] or the intense sadness and indignation which\r\noverpowered us as we followed the road along which 121 women and\r\nchildren (many of them well born and delicately nurtured) wended\r\ntheir weary way, amidst jeers and insults, to meet the terrible fate\r\nawaiting them. After their husbands and protectors had been slain, the\r\nwretched company of widows and orphans were first taken to the Savada\r\nhouse, and then to the little Native hut, where they were doomed to\r\nlive through two more weeks of intensest misery, until at length the\r\nend came, and the last scene in that long drama of foulest treachery\r\nand unequalled brutality was enacted. Our unfortunate countrywomen,\r\nwith their little children, as my readers will remember, were murdered\r\nas the sound of Havelock's avenging guns was heard.\r\n\r\nWe found at Cawnpore some men who had fought their way from Allahabad\r\nwith Havelock's force, from whom we heard of the difficulties they had\r\nencountered on their way, and the subsequent hardships the gallant\r\nlittle force had to endure in its attempts to reach Lucknow. They also\r\ntold us that Havelock and Outram, with only 3,179 men of all arms, and\r\n14 guns, had succeeded in forcing their way through that great city\r\nwith a loss of 700, but only to be themselves immediately surrounded\r\nby the vast multitude of the enemy, who for three whole months had\r\nvainly endeavoured to overpower the heroic defenders of the Residency.\r\n\r\nAt Cawnpore there were very few troops. The Head-Quarters of the 64th\r\nFoot, under Colonel Wilson, and some recovered invalids belonging\r\nto regiments which had gone to Lucknow, had held it for more than a\r\nmonth, within an entrenchment thrown up on the river bank to protect\r\nthe bridge of boats. Just before we arrived four companies of the\r\n93rd Highlanders had marched in. It was the first time I had seen a\r\nHighland regiment, and I was duly impressed by their fine physique,\r\nand not a little also by their fine dress. They certainly looked\r\nsplendid in their bonnets and kilts--a striking contrast to my\r\nwar-worn, travel-stained comrades of the Movable Column. An _avant\r\ncourier_ of the Naval Brigade had also come in, sent on by Captain\r\nWilliam Peel, of H.M.S. _Shannon_, to arrange for the rest of the\r\nblue-jackets who were about to arrive--the first naval officer, I\r\nimagine, who had ever been sent on duty so far up the country as\r\nCawnpore.\r\n\r\nOther troops were rapidly being pushed up, and officers who had been\r\non leave to England were daily arriving, having hurried out to join\r\ntheir different regiments in various parts of India. Amongst these was\r\nan old friend and brother subaltern of mine, Augustus Otway Mayne,\r\nwhom, greatly to my satisfaction, Hope Grant appointed D.A.Q.M.G. to\r\nhelp me, for there was now more work to be done than I could well get\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nThe day after our arrival at Cawnpore we heard that the new\r\nCommander-in-Chief, Sir Colin Campbell, was to leave Calcutta that\r\nevening to take command of the force with which he hoped to effect the\r\nrelief of the Lucknow garrison, and with this news came an order to\r\nHope Grant from Sir Colin to get into communication with the Alambagh,\r\na small garden-house not quite two miles from the city of Lucknow,\r\nbuilt by one of the Begums of the ex-King of Oudh, in which the sick\r\nand wounded, tents and spare stores, had been left in charge of a\r\nsmall detachment, when Outram and Havelock advanced towards the\r\nResidency on the 25th September.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th October we left Cawnpore, and crossed the Ganges into\r\nOudh, taking with us the four companies of the 93rd Highlanders, and\r\nthe men belonging to Havelock's force, whom I have mentioned as having\r\nbeen left behind on account of sickness.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st we were at Bani bridge, more than half-way to the\r\nAlambagh, when a telegram reached the Brigadier directing him to halt\r\nuntil Sir Colin Campbell (who had got as far as Cawnpore) should\r\narrive.\r\n\r\nHope Grant did not think the ground we were on well adapted for a\r\nprolonged halt; that afternoon, therefore, I went off with Mayne to\r\nreconnoitre the country for a more suitable place. We fixed upon\r\nan open plain at the village of Bhantira, about three miles nearer\r\nLucknow. We met with no opposition that day, but the country people\r\nin the neighbourhood had shown marked hostility by killing one or two\r\nsoldiers and every camp-follower who had strayed from the main road;\r\nso we were careful to examine Bhantira and all the neighbouring\r\nvillages, but were unable to discover the slightest sign of an enemy.\r\n\r\nAs the next day's march was such a very short one, we did not start\r\nuntil 7 a.m., instead of before daybreak as usual. Mayne and I rode on\r\nahead with a couple of _sowars_, and reached the site we had chosen\r\nfor the camp without meeting a single suspicious-looking individual.\r\nWe then sent back the escort to bring up the camp colour-men, and\r\nwhile waiting for them, we entered into conversation with some passing\r\npilgrims, who told us they were on their way to Benares to procure\r\nholy water from the Ganges. Suddenly a bullet whizzed over our heads,\r\nfired from the direction from which we had just come. Looking back,\r\nto our amazement we saw a crowd of armed men at a distance of between\r\nthree and four hundred yards, completely cutting us off from the\r\ncolumn. The whole plain was alive with them. When they saw they were\r\nobserved, they advanced towards us, shouting and firing. Fortunately\r\nfor us, we had made ourselves perfectly acquainted with the country\r\nthe previous day, and instantly realized that escape by our right (as\r\nwe faced Lucknow) was impossible, because of a huge impassable _jhil_.\r\nThere was another _jhil_ to our left front, but at some little\r\ndistance off, and our only chance seemed to be in riding hard enough\r\nto get round the enemy's flank before they could get close enough to\r\nthis _jhil_ to stop us.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we put spurs to our horses and galloped as fast as they\r\ncould carry us to our left; the enemy turned in the same direction,\r\nand made for a village we must pass, and which we could see was\r\nalready occupied. The firing got hotter and more uncomfortable as\r\nwe neared this village, the walls of which we skirted at our best\r\npossible pace. We cleared the village, and hoped we had distanced the\r\nrebels, when suddenly we came upon a deep _nulla_. Mayne got safely to\r\nthe other side, but my horse stumbled and rolled over with me into the\r\nwater at the bottom. In the fall my hand was slightly cut by my sword,\r\nwhich I had drawn, thinking we might have to fight for our lives; the\r\nblood flowed freely, and made the reins so slippery when I tried to\r\nremount, that it was with considerable difficulty I got into the\r\nsaddle. The enemy were already at the edge of the _nulla_, and\r\npreparing to fire, so there was no time to be lost. I struggled\r\nthrough the water and up the opposite bank, and ducking my head to\r\navoid the shots, now coming thick and fast, galloped straight into\r\nsome high cultivation in which Mayne had already sought shelter.\r\nFinally we succeeded in making our way to the main body of the force,\r\nwhere we found Hope Grant in great anxiety about us, as he had heard\r\nthe firing and knew we were ahead. The dear old fellow evinced his\r\nsatisfaction at our safe return by shaking each of us heartily by the\r\nhand, repeating over and over again in his quick, quaint way, 'Well,\r\nmy boys, well, my boys, very glad to have you back! never thought\r\nto see you again.' The column now moved on, and we found ourselves\r\nopposed to a vast body of men, not soldiers, but country people,\r\nwho in those days were all armed warriors, and who spent their time\r\nchiefly in fighting with each other. As we approached the crowd\r\nturned, opened out, and fled in every direction, spreading over the\r\nplain and concealing themselves in the long grass. We gave chase and\r\nkilled many, but a large proportion escaped. Favoured by the high\r\ncrops, they disappeared with that marvellous celerity with which\r\nNatives can almost instantly become invisible, leaving in our\r\npossession a 9-pounder brass gun. On this occasion we had thirty\r\nkilled and wounded.\r\n\r\nWe could not at the time understand where the men had sprung from\r\nwho so suddenly attacked us; but it afterwards transpired that some\r\npowerful _zemindars_[4] in the neighbourhood had collected all the\r\nforces they could get together, and established them after dark in the\r\nvery villages we had so carefully examined the previous afternoon and\r\nhad found completely deserted, with the intention of falling upon the\r\ncolumn as it passed in the early morning. The unusually late hour at\r\nwhich the march was made, however, disconcerted their little plan,\r\nand giving up all hope of the force coming that day, they consoled\r\nthemselves by trying to get hold of Mayne and myself.\r\n\r\nWe halted on the 3rd and 4th November. On the 5th, Hope Grant sent\r\na force to the Alambagh for the purpose of escorting a long line of\r\ncarts and camels laden with provisions and ammunition, which the\r\nCommander-in-Chief was desirous of having near at hand, in case the\r\nrelief of the Lucknow garrison should prove a more prolonged operation\r\nthan he hoped or anticipated it was likely to be.\r\n\r\nAs we neared the Alambagh the enemy's guns opened on us from our\r\nright, while their Cavalry threatened us on both flanks. They were\r\neasily disposed of, and we deposited the stores, receiving in exchange\r\na number of sick and wounded who were to be sent back to Cawnpore.\r\n\r\nA curious incident happened at the Alambagh. I was employed inside the\r\nenclosure, when all at once I heard a noise and commotion some little\r\ndistance off. Getting on to the roof, I looked over the plain, and saw\r\nour troops flying in every direction; there was no firing, no enemy in\r\nsight, but evidently something was wrong; so I mounted my horse and\r\nrode to the scene of confusion, where I found that the ignominious\r\nflight of our troops was caused by infuriated bees which had been\r\ndisturbed by an officer of the 9th Lancers thoughtlessly thrusting a\r\nlance into their nest. There were no serious consequences, but the\r\nHighlanders were heard to remark on the unsuitability of their dress\r\nfor an encounter with an enemy of that description.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th November Sir Colin Campbell joined the column, accompanied\r\nby his Chief of the Staff, Brigadier-General Mansfield.[5]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORDS CLYDE AND SANDHURST.\r\n(SIR COLIN CAMPBELL AND SIR WILLIAM MANSFIELD.)\r\n_From a photograph taken in India._]\r\n\r\nThe following morning we were surprised to hear that a European from\r\nthe Lucknow garrison had arrived in camp. All were keen to see him,\r\nand to hear how it was faring with those who had been shut up in\r\nthe Residency for so long; but the new-comer was the bearer of very\r\nimportant information from Sir James Outram, and to prevent any chance\r\nof its getting about, the Commander-in-Chief kept the messenger, Mr.\r\nKavanagh, a close prisoner in his own tent.\r\n\r\nOutram, being anxious that the officer in command of the relieving\r\nforce should not follow the same route taken by himself and Havelock,\r\nand wishing to communicate his ideas more at length than was possible\r\nin a note conveyed as usual by a spy, Kavanagh, a clerk in an office\r\nin Lucknow, pluckily volunteered to carry a letter. It was an offer\r\nwhich appealed to the heart of the 'Bayard of the East,' as Outram has\r\nbeen appropriately called, and just such an errand as he himself,\r\nhad he been in a less responsible position, would have delighted to\r\nundertake. Outram thoroughly understood the risk of the enterprise,\r\nand placed it clearly before the brave volunteer, who, nothing\r\ndaunted, expressed his readiness to start at once, and his confidence\r\nin being able to reach the British camp.\r\n\r\nDisguised as a Native, and accompanied by a man of Oudh, on whose\r\ncourage and loyalty he was convinced he could rely, Kavanagh left the\r\nResidency after dark on the 9th and got safely across the Gumti. He\r\nand his guide remained in the suburbs mixing with the people until\r\nthe streets might be expected to be pretty well empty, when they\r\nre-crossed the river and got safely through the city. They were\r\naccosted more than once on their way, but were saved by the readiness\r\nof the Native, who it had been arranged should answer all inquiries,\r\nthough Kavanagh, having been born and bred in the country, could\r\nhimself speak the language fluently. On the morning of the 10th they\r\nmade themselves known to a piquet of Punjab Cavalry on duty near the\r\nAlambagh.\r\n\r\nOutram, profiting by his own experience, wished the relieving column\r\nto be spared having to fight its way through the streets of Lucknow.\r\nThis was all the more necessary because the enemy, calculating on our\r\nfollowing the same route as before, had destroyed the bridge over the\r\ncanal and made extensive preparations to oppose our advance in that\r\ndirection. Outram explained his views most clearly, and sent with his\r\nletter a plan on which the line he proposed we should take was plainly\r\nmarked. He recommended that the advance should be made, by the\r\nDilkusha[6] and Martinière,[7] and that the canal should be crossed\r\nby the bridge nearest the Gumti. Outram showed his military acumen\r\nin suggesting this route, as our right flank would be covered by the\r\nriver, and therefore could only be molested by a comparatively distant\r\nfire. Sir Colin, appreciating all the advantages pointed out, readily\r\naccepted and strictly adhered to this plan of advance, except that,\r\ninstead of crossing the canal by the bridge, we forded it a little\r\nnearer the river, a wise divergence from Outram's recommendation, and\r\none which he would assuredly have advised had he been aware that the\r\ncanal was fordable at this spot, as it kept us altogether clear of the\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nOutram did not touch in his despatch upon any question but the\r\nall-important one of how the junction between his own and the\r\nrelieving forces could best be effected. Many other matters, however,\r\nclaimed the earnest consideration of the Commander-in-Chief before he\r\ncould proceed. He had to determine what was to be done to secure the\r\nsafety of the women and children in the Residency, after the first\r\nmost pressing duty of relieving the garrison had been accomplished.\r\nCawnpore was again in great danger from the Gwalior mutineers, who,\r\nfoiled at Agra, and finding that the Maharaja Sindhia would not\r\nespouse their cause, had placed themselves under the orders of the\r\nRani of Jhansi and Tantia Topi, the vile Mahratta whom the Nana made\r\nuse of to carry out the massacre of the Sati-Choura Ghat; led by\r\nthis man the rebels were seriously threatening Cawnpore, and it was\r\nnecessary to take steps for its security. Then again the city of\r\nLucknow had to be thought of; its capture and the restoration of\r\nBritish authority were alike essential, but our Chief knew that he\r\nhad neither the time nor the means at his disposal to undertake this\r\nimportant operation at once. He therefore made up his mind that so\r\nsoon as the Residency had been relieved he would withdraw altogether\r\nfrom Lucknow, and place a force at the Cawnpore side of the city, to\r\nform the nucleus of the army with which he hoped later on to take the\r\nplace, and to keep open communication with his Head-Quarters, while\r\nhe himself should hurry back to Cawnpore, taking with him all the\r\nnon-combatants and the sick and wounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: No account of the quantity and description of supplies\r\nstored in the Residency had been kept, or, if kept, it was destroyed\r\nwhen the Mutiny broke out. Captain James, the energetic Commissariat\r\nofficer, on receiving Sir Henry Lawrence's order to provision the\r\nResidency, spent his time riding about the country buying supplies of\r\nall descriptions, which were stored wherever room could be found for\r\nthem. James was very severely wounded at the fight at Chinhut, and was\r\nincapacitated the greater part of the siege. It was only by degrees\r\nthat some of the supplies were discovered; no one knew how much had\r\nbeen collected, and no record of the quantities issued from day to\r\nday could be kept. When Outram joined hands with Inglis, his first\r\nquestion was, 'How much food is there?' Thanks to Sir Henry Lawrence's\r\nforesight, there was an ample supply, not only for the original\r\ngarrison, but for the numbers by which it was augmented on the arrival\r\nof the relieving force. Of this, however, Outram must have been\r\nignorant when he despatched the little note to which I have alluded in\r\nthe text.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: On the 25th June, after twenty-one days of intense\r\nsuffering--with his numbers so reduced as to render further defence\r\nscarcely possible, with starvation staring him in the face, and with\r\nno hope of succour--Sir Hugh Wheeler most reluctantly consented to\r\ncapitulate. The first overtures were made by the Nana, who, despairing\r\nof being able to capture the position, and with disaffection in his\r\nown camp, sent the following message to the General: 'All those who\r\nare in no way connected with the acts of Lord Dalhousie, and are\r\nwilling to lay down their arms, shall receive a safe passage to\r\nAllahabad.' This missive, which was without signature, was in the\r\nhandwriting of Azimula Khan, a Mahomedan who had been employed by the\r\nNana as his Agent in England, and was addressed, 'To the subjects of\r\nHer Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria.' General Wheeler agreed\r\nto give up the fortification, the treasure, and the Artillery, on\r\ncondition that each man should be allowed to carry his arms and sixty\r\nrounds of ammunition, that carriages should be provided for the\r\nconveyance of the wounded, the women, and the children, and\r\nthat boats, with a sufficiency of flour, should be ready at the\r\nneighbouring _ghat_ (landing-place). The Nana accepted these\r\nconditions, and three officers of the garrison were deputed to go to\r\nthe river and see that the boats were properly prepared. They found\r\nabout forty boats moored, and apparently ready for departure, and in\r\ntheir presence a show of putting supplies on board was made.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The Nana never intended that one of the garrison should\r\nleave Cawnpore alive, and during the night of the 26th June he\r\narranged with Tantia Topi to have soldiers and guns concealed at the\r\nSati-Choura Ghat to open fire upon the Europeans he had been unable to\r\nconquer as soon as the embarkation had been effected and they could no\r\nlonger defend themselves and their helpless companions in misery. The\r\nriver was low and the boats were aground, having been purposely drawn\r\nclose to the shore. When the last man had stepped on board, at a given\r\nsignal the boatmen jumped into the water and waded to the bank. They\r\nhad contrived to secrete burning charcoal in the thatch of most of the\r\nboats; this soon blazed up, and as the flames rose and the dry wood\r\ncrackled, the troops in ambush on the shore opened fire. Officers and\r\nmen tried in vain to push off the boats; three only floated, and of\r\nthese two drifted to the opposite side, where sepoys were waiting to\r\nmurder the passengers. The third boat floated down the stream, and of\r\nthe number on board four eventually escaped--Lieutenants Thomson and\r\nDelafosse, both of the 53rd Native Infantry, Private Murphy of the\r\n84th Foot, and Gunner Sullivan, of the Bengal Artillery. The rest\r\nof the officers and men were killed or drowned, and the women and\r\nchildren who escaped were carried off as prisoners.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Permanent occupiers of the land, either of the landlord\r\nclass, as in Bengal, Oudh, and the North-West Provinces, or of the\r\nyeoman class, as in the Punjab.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Afterwards General Lord Sandhurst, G.C.B., G.C.S.I.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The Dilkusha house was built at the beginning of the\r\ncentury by a king of Oudh as a hunting-box and country residence, and\r\nclose to it he cleared away the jungle and laid out a large park,\r\nwhich he stocked with herds of deer and other game.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The Martinière was built by Claude Martin, a French\r\nsoldier of fortune, who came out to India, under Count de Lally,\r\nin the stirring days of 1757. In 1761 he was taken prisoner by the\r\nEnglish at Pondicherry and sent to Bengal. After the conclusion of\r\nthe war he enlisted in the English Army, and on attaining the rank of\r\nCaptain he got permission to attach himself to the Court of the King\r\nof Oudh, where he soon obtained supreme influence, and became to all\r\npractical purposes Prime Minister. He remained an officer of the East\r\nIndia Company's Service, and at the time of his death held the rank\r\nof Major-General. He amassed a large fortune, and by his will founded\r\ncolleges at Lucknow, Calcutta, and Lyons, the place of his birth. His\r\ndirections that his house at the former place should never be sold,\r\nbut should 'serve as a college for educating children and men in\r\nthe English language and religion,' were carried out by the British\r\nGovernment, and Martin lies buried in its vault.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n1857\r\n\r\n  Sir Colin's preparations--The Alambagh\r\n  --The Dilkusha and Martinière--Mayne's death--A tall-talk story\r\n  --Ammunition required--A night march--The advance on Lucknow\r\n  --Sir Colin wounded--The attack on the Sikandarbagh\r\n  --Heroic deeds--The 4th Punjab Infantry\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, the 11th, I had the honour of making the\r\nCommander-in-Chief's acquaintance. The manner of my introduction was\r\npeculiarly unceremonious. I had left my own tent to be repaired at\r\nCawnpore, and was sharing one with Norman, who was well known to, and\r\ngreatly believed in by, His Excellency, whose Brigade-Major he had\r\nbeen at Peshawar. Before we were out of bed we heard Sir Colin's\r\nvoice outside. He had come to speak to Norman about his plans for\r\nthe future, and as the conversation seemed likely to be of a very\r\nconfidential nature, and it was too dark for him to see me, I asked\r\nNorman to make my presence known. Sir Colin said to Norman somewhat\r\nroughly, 'Who is he?' and on my name being mentioned, he asked if I\r\nwere to be trusted. Norman having vouched for my discretion, the\r\nold Chief was apparently satisfied, and then ensued an intensely\r\ninteresting discussion on Outram's letter, Kavanagh's description of\r\nthe state of affairs in the Residency, and the manner in which it was\r\nbest to carry out Outram's recommendations.\r\n\r\nThat same afternoon the Commander-in-Chief reviewed the column, which\r\nnow amounted to about 600 Cavalry and 3,500 Infantry, with 42 guns.[1]\r\nThe parade was under the command of Hope Grant, who had been given the\r\nrank of Brigadier-General, and put in executive command of the whole\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nSir Colin spoke a few inspiriting words to each regiment and battery,\r\nbeing particularly appreciative and complimentary in his remarks to\r\nthe Delhi troops, who certainly looked the picture of workmanlike\r\nsoldiers; and, considering what they had accomplished, there was\r\nnothing invidious in the Chief's singling them out. The Bengal\r\nArtillery came in for a large share of praise; he had a strong liking\r\nfor them, having been with them on service,[2] and seen of what good\r\nstuff they were made. He recognized several old acquaintances amongst\r\nthe officers, and freely expressed his satisfaction at having such\r\nreliable batteries to help him in the hazardous operation he was about\r\nto undertake. He was careful also to say a few words of commendation\r\nto the four squadrons of Punjab Cavalry, and the two regiments of\r\nPunjab Infantry, the only Native troops, except the Sappers, with the\r\ncolumn.\r\n\r\nThat evening orders were issued for a march to the Alambagh the\r\nfollowing morning. It may perhaps seem as if Sir Colin was rather\r\nleisurely in his movements, but he had ascertained that the Lucknow\r\ngarrison was in no immediate want of food, as had been reported, and\r\nhe was determined to leave nothing undone to ensure the success of the\r\nundertaking. He personally attended to the smallest detail, and he had\r\nto arrange for the transport of the sick and wounded, and the women\r\nand children, shut up in the Residency, numbering in all not less than\r\nfifteen hundred souls.\r\n\r\nEverything being ready, we began our march towards Lucknow, one and\r\nall eager to have a share in the rescue of our suffering countrywomen\r\nand their children from a most perilous position, and in relieving\r\nsoldiers who had so long and so nobly performed the most harassing\r\nduty, while they cheerfully endured the greatest privations.\r\n\r\nWe had proceeded but a short distance, when the advance guard was\r\nfired upon by some guns in position on our right, near the old fort of\r\nJalalabad. An extensive swamp protected the enemy's right flank, while\r\non their left were a number of water-cuts and broken ground. The\r\nInfantry and Artillery wheeled round and attacked the battery in\r\nfront, while Hugh Gough pushed on with his squadron of Cavalry to see\r\nif he could find a way through the apparently impassable swamp to the\r\nenemy's right and rear. Bourchier's battery coming up in the nick of\r\ntime, the hostile guns were soon silenced, and Gough, having succeeded\r\nin getting through the _jhil_, made a most plucky charge, in which he\r\ncaptured two guns and killed a number of the enemy. For his gallant\r\nconduct on this occasion Gough was awarded the Victoria Cross, the\r\nsecond of two brothers to win this much-coveted distinction.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Adrian Hope, who commanded a brigade, was ordered to\r\nseize the Jalalabad fort, but finding it evacuated, he blew up one of\r\nthe walls, and so rendered it indefensible.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 13th I accompanied the Commander-in-Chief in a\r\nreconnaissance towards the Charbagh bridge and the left front of the\r\nAlambagh, a ruse to deceive the enemy as to the real line of our\r\nadvance. When riding along he told me, to my infinite pride and\r\ndelight, that I was to have the honour of conducting the force to the\r\nDilkusha. The first thing I did on returning to camp was to find a\r\ngood guide. We had only about five miles to go; but it was necessary\r\nto make sure that the direction taken avoided obstacles which might\r\nimpede the passage of the Artillery. I was fortunate in finding a\r\nfairly intelligent Native, who, after a great deal of persuasion,\r\nagreed, for a reward, to take me by a track over which guns could\r\ntravel. I never let this man out of my sight, and made him show me\r\nenough of the road to convince me he knew the way and meant fair\r\ndealing.\r\n\r\nThe Alambagh now proved most useful; all our camp equipage was packed\r\ninside the enclosure, for we took no tents with us, and all our spare\r\nstores were left there. A rough description of semaphore, too, was\r\nconstructed on the highest point of the building, by means of which we\r\nwere able to communicate with the Residency. It was put in Orders that\r\nthe troops were to breakfast early the next morning, and that they\r\nwere to take three days' rations in their haversacks; while sufficient\r\nfor fourteen days was to be carried by the Commissariat.\r\n\r\nJust before we started on the 14th November we were strengthened by\r\nthe arrival of 200 of the Military Train equipped as Cavalry, two\r\nMadras Horse Artillery guns, and another company of Madras Sappers.\r\n\r\nCaptain Moir, of the Bengal Artillery, was placed in charge of the\r\nAlambagh, with a garrison consisting of the 75th Foot, 50 of the\r\nregiment of Ferozepore,[3] and a few Artillerymen. The 75th was the\r\nfirst regiment to move down from the hills when the news of the\r\noutbreak at Meerut reached Head-Quarters; it had done grand service,\r\nhad suffered heavily during the siege of Delhi, and had well earned,\r\nand badly needed, a rest. It was now only 300 strong, and had lost in\r\nsix months 9 officers, in action and from disease, besides 12 wounded.\r\nThe officers were all friends of mine, and I was very sorry to leave\r\nthem behind, particularly Barter, the Adjutant, a jolly, good-hearted\r\nIrishman, and an excellent officer.\r\n\r\nWe marched at 9 a.m., keeping to the south of the Alambagh and the\r\nJalalabad fort. We then struck across the fields to the ground now\r\noccupied by the Native Cavalry lines, and on to the open space upon\r\nwhich the present race-course is marked out. On reaching this point\r\nthe Dilkusha came in sight about a mile in front. As we approached, a\r\nfew shots were fired at us; but the enemy rapidly disappeared as the\r\nCavalry and Horse Artillery, followed by the Infantry of the advance\r\nguard, in skirmishing order, passed through an opening which had been\r\nhastily made in the wall of the enclosure.\r\n\r\nThe gallop across the Dilkusha park was quite a pretty sight: deer,\r\nwhich had been quietly browsing, bounded away on all sides, frightened\r\nby our approach and the rattle of the guns; while the routed sepoys\r\nflew down the grassy slope leading to the Martinière. We reined up for\r\na few seconds to look at the view which opened out before us. In front\r\nrose the fluted masonry column of the Martinière, 123 feet high;\r\ndirectly behind, the picturesque building itself, and in the distance\r\nthe domes and minarets of the mosques and palaces within the city of\r\nLucknow; all looked bright and fair in the morning sun.\r\n\r\nWe could see that the Martinière was occupied; a crowd of sepoys were\r\ncollected round the building; and as we showed ourselves on the brow\r\nof the hill, a number of round shot came tumbling in amongst us.\r\n\r\nRemmington's troop of Horse Artillery, Bourchier's battery, and a\r\nheavy howitzer brought up by Captain Hardy, now came into action,\r\nand under cover of their fire the 8th Foot and 1st battalion of\r\nDetachments attacked and drove the enemy out of the Martinière, while\r\nthe Cavalry pursued them as far as the canal.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion my friend Watson greatly distinguished himself.\r\nEntirely alone he attacked the enemy's Cavalry, and was at once\r\nengaged with its leader and six of the front men; he fought gallantly,\r\nbut the unequal contest could not have lasted much longer had not\r\nProbyn, who, with his own and Watson's squadrons, was only about 300\r\nyards off, become aware of his comrade's critical position, and dashed\r\nto his assistance. For this 'and gallantry on many other occasions,'\r\nHope Grant recommended Watson for the Victoria Cross, which he duly\r\nreceived.[4]\r\n\r\nBy noon on the 14th we had occupied the Dilkusha and Martinière, and\r\nplaced our outposts along the right bank of the canal from the river\r\nto the point immediately opposite Banks's house. The left bank was\r\nheld in force by the rebels. Early in the afternoon I went with Hope\r\nGrant, accompanied by a small force of Cavalry, to ascertain whether\r\nit would be possible to ford the canal somewhere close to the river,\r\nand we succeeded in finding a place by which the whole force crossed\r\ntwo days later. Our movements were fortunately not noticed by the\r\nenemy, whose attention was concentrated on the roads leading direct to\r\nthe city from the Dilkusha and Martinière, by which they expected our\r\nadvance to be made.\r\n\r\nSir Colin, meanwhile, had fixed his Head-Quarters in the Martinière,\r\non the topmost pinnacle of which he caused a semaphore to be erected\r\nfor communication with Outram. From this post of vantage Kavanagh was\r\nable to point out to the Commander-in-Chief the different objects of\r\nmost interest to him--the positions taken up by the enemy; the group\r\nof buildings, of which the Chatta Manzil[5] was the most conspicuous,\r\nthen occupied by the gallant troops led by Outram and Havelock, who,\r\nby overwhelming numbers alone, had been prevented from carrying their\r\nglorious enterprise to a successful issue; the Residency, where,\r\nthanks to Sir Henry Lawrence's foresight and admirable arrangements,\r\na handful of heroic Britons had been able to defy the hordes of\r\ndisciplined soldiers and armed men who, for nearly three months,\r\nday and night, had never ceased to attack the position; and the\r\nKaisarbagh, that pretentious, garish palace of the Kings of Oudh, the\r\ncentre of every kind of evil and debauchery.\r\n\r\nLater in the day the enemy made a determined attack on our centre,\r\nwhich was checked by Brigadier Little advancing with the 9th Lancers\r\nand some guns. On a few rounds being fired, they retired from the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of the canal, and in the belief that there\r\nwould be no further trouble that day, the Cavalry and Artillery\r\nreturned to the Martinière; but the guns were hardly unlimbered before\r\nheavy firing was heard from the direction of Banks's house.\r\n\r\nI galloped off with Mayne to ascertain the cause. Some little distance\r\nfrom the canal we separated, Mayne going to the left, I to the right.\r\nI found the piquets hotly engaged, and the officer in command begged\r\nme to get him some assistance. I returned to Hope Grant to report\r\nwhat was going on, but on the way I met the supports coming up, and\r\npresently they were followed by the remainder of Hope's and Russell's\r\nbrigades. Russell had, early in the day, with soldierly instinct,\r\nseized two villages a little above the bridge to the north of Banks's\r\nhouse; this enabled him to bring a fire to bear upon the enemy as\r\nthey advanced, and effectually prevented their turning our left. Hope\r\nopened fire with Remmington's troop, Bourchier's battery, and some of\r\nPeel's 24-pounders, and as soon as he found it had taken effect and\r\nthe rebels were shaken, he proceeded to push them across the canal and\r\nfinally drove them off with considerable loss.\r\n\r\nHope's and Russell's united action, by which our left flank was\r\nsecured, was most timely, for had it been turned, our long line\r\nof camels, laden with ammunition, and the immense string of carts\r\ncarrying supplies, would in all probability have been captured. As it\r\nwas, the rear guard, under Lieutenant-Colonel Ewart,[6] of the 93rd\r\nHighlanders, had a hot time of it; it was frequently attacked, and its\r\nprogress was so slow that it was more than twenty-four hours between\r\nthe Alambagh and the Dilkusha.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the fight I heard, with great grief, that my poor\r\nfriend Mayne had been killed, shot through the breast a few seconds\r\nafter he had left me. He was seen to turn his horse, and, after going\r\na short distance, fall to the ground; when picked up he was quite\r\ndead. This was all I could learn. No one was able to tell me where his\r\nbody had been taken, and I looked for it myself all that evening in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak the next morning, accompanied by Arthur Bunny, the cheery\r\nAdjutant of Horse Artillery, I began my search afresh, and at\r\nlength we discovered the body inside a doolie under the wall of the\r\nMartinière. As there was no knowing how soon our services might be\r\nrequired, we decided to bury the poor fellow at once. I chose a spot\r\nclose by for his grave, which was dug with the help of some gunners,\r\nand then Bunny and I, aided by two or three brother officers, laid our\r\nfriend in it just as he was, in his blue frock-coat and long boots,\r\nhis eyeglass in his eye, as he always carried it. The only thing I\r\ntook away was his sword, which I eventually made over to his family.\r\nIt was a sad little ceremony. Overhanging the grave was a young tree,\r\nupon which I cut the initials 'A.O.M.'--not very deep, for there was\r\nlittle time: they were quite distinct, however, and remained so long\r\nenough for the grave to be traced by Mayne's friends, who erected the\r\nstone now to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe whole of that day (the 15th) was spent in preparing for the\r\nadvance. The Dilkusha was turned into a general depot, where the sick\r\nand wounded were placed, also the Ordnance park and stores of every\r\ndescription. A rough defence was thrown up round the building, and a\r\ngarrison was left to protect it, consisting of five Field guns, half\r\nthe 9th Lancers, the Military Train, a squadron of Punjab Cavalry, and\r\nthe 8th Foot, the whole under the command of Little, the Brigadier of\r\nCavalry.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon Sir Colin made a feint to the left of our position\r\nfor the purpose of diverting the attention of the enemy from the\r\nreal line of advance. He massed the Artillery in this direction, and\r\nordered a constant mortar fire to be kept up during the night on the\r\nBegum palace and the barracks. To further strengthen the belief that\r\noperations would be carried on from our left, some of the piquets\r\non our right were drawn in; this induced the enemy to make a slight\r\ndemonstration in that direction. They crossed the canal, but were\r\nspeedily driven back by the Madras Horse Artillery guns. They then\r\nopened fire with a 12-pounder howitzer from the west side of the\r\nGumti, when a really most extraordinary incident happened, which I am\r\nnot sure I should have the courage to relate, were it not that Sir\r\nDighton Probyn and Sir John Watson, who were close by and saw what\r\ntook place, are able to vouch for the accuracy of my story.\r\n\r\nA shell, fortunately a blind one, from the enemy's howitzer came into\r\nWatson's squadron, which was drawn up under the bank of the Martinière\r\ntank; it struck a trooper's saddle in front, and must have lifted the\r\nman partly out of it, for it passed between his thigh and the horse,\r\ntearing the saddle[7] to shreds, and sending one piece of it high into\r\nthe air. The horse was knocked down, but not hurt; the man's thigh was\r\nonly badly bruised, and he was able to ride again in a few days. One\r\nof Watson's officers, Captain Cosserat, having examined the man and\r\nhorse, came up and reported their condition to Watson, who, of course,\r\nwas expecting to be told they were both dead, and added: 'I think we\r\nhad better not tell this story in England, for no one would believe\r\nit.' I myself was close to the squadron, and distinctly saw what\r\nhappened, [8]\r\n\r\nAll that day (the 15th) I had been very hard at work, and was greatly\r\nlooking forward to what I hoped would be a quiet night, when an\r\nAide-de-camp appeared, who informed me that the Commander-in-Chief\r\ndesired my presence at the Martinière.\r\n\r\nOn reporting myself to His Excellency, he told me that he was not\r\nsatisfied that a sufficient reserve of small-arm ammunition had been\r\nbrought with the force, and that the only chance of getting more in\r\ntime was to send back to the Alambagh for it that night, adding that\r\nhe could neither afford the time nor spare the troops which would be\r\nrequired, were the business of fetching the additional supply to\r\nbe postponed until the following day. Sir Colin then asked me if\r\nI thought I could find my way back to the Alambagh in the dark. I\r\nanswered, 'I am sure I can.' I might have hesitated to speak so\r\nconfidently had I not taken the precaution of placing the man who\r\nhad acted as my guide on the 14th in charge of some Afghan\r\n_chuprassies_[9] attached to the Quartermaster-General's department,\r\nwith strict orders not to lose sight of him. I thought, therefore,\r\nI would have him to depend upon if my own memory failed me. The\r\nCommander-in-Chief impressed very strongly upon me the great necessity\r\nfor caution, and told me I could take what escort I thought necessary,\r\nbut that, whatever happened, I must be back by daybreak, as he had\r\nsignalled to Outram that the force would advance on the morrow. Sir\r\nColin desired that the Ordnance officer, whose fault it was that\r\nsufficient ammunition had not been brought, should go back with me and\r\nbe left at the Alambagh.\r\n\r\nIt was then dusk, and there was no time to be lost. In the first\r\ninstance I went to my General, and reporting the orders I had received\r\nfrom the Commander-in-Chief, consulted him about my escort. Hope Grant\r\nstrongly urged my taking with me a troop of the 9th Lancers, as well\r\nas some Native Cavalry, but for a night trip I thought it would be\r\nbetter to employ Natives only. I knew that my one chance of success\r\ndepended on neither being seen nor heard, and Native Cavalry move more\r\nquietly than British, chiefly because their scabbards are of wood,\r\ninstead of steel. I felt, too, that if we came across the enemy, which\r\nwas not improbable, and got scattered, Natives would run less risk,\r\nand be better able to look after themselves. All this I explained to\r\nthe General, but in the kindness of his heart he pressed me to take\r\nthe Lancers, telling me he would feel happier about me if I had my own\r\ncountrymen with me; but I stuck to my own opinion, and it was arranged\r\nthat I was to be accompanied by Younghusband and Hugh Gough, with\r\ntheir respective squadrons of Native Cavalry. I took leave of my kind\r\nand considerate General, and hurried off first to warn the two Cavalry\r\nofficers, then to the Dilkusha to tell Lieutenant Tod Brown, in charge\r\nof the Ordnance depot, that his assistant was to go with me, and\r\nlastly to arrange with the Commissariat officer for camels upon which\r\nto bring back the ammunition.\r\n\r\nIt was quite dark before I got to the place where my servants had\r\ncollected, and where I expected to find my guide. What was my horror\r\nto hear that he had disappeared! He had made his escape in the\r\nconfusion consequent on the enemy's attacks the previous afternoon.\r\nWhat was to be done now? I was in despair--and became more and more\r\ndoubtful of my ability to find the Alambagh in the dark. By daylight,\r\nand with the aid of a compass, which I always carried about me, I\r\nshould have had little difficulty, even though the country we had to\r\nget over was intersected by ravines and water-courses, not to speak of\r\nthe uncompromising _jhil_ near the Jalalabad fort. However, go I must.\r\nI could not possibly tell the Commander-in-Chief that I was unable to\r\ncarry out a duty for which he had selected me--there was nothing for\r\nit but to trust to my own recollection of the route and hope for the\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nEverything having been put in train, I returned to the Artillery\r\nbivouac, managed a hasty dinner, mounted a fresh horse, and, about\r\n9 p.m., started off, accompanied by Younghusband, Hugh Gough, the\r\nunlucky Ordnance officer, two squadrons of Cavalry, and 150 camels.\r\n\r\nWe got on well enough until we reached the broken ground near the\r\npresent Native Cavalry lines, when we lost the road, or rather track,\r\nfor road there was none. We could see nothing but the lights of the\r\nenemy's piquets at an uncomfortably short distance to our right. I\r\nstruck a match, and made out from the compass the right direction; but\r\nthat did not help us to clear the ravines, which, in our efforts to\r\nturn or get through them, made our way appear interminable. At length\r\nwe found ourselves upon open ground; but, alas! having edged off too\r\nmuch to our right we were in close proximity to the enemy's piquets,\r\nand could distinctly hear their voices. We halted to collect the long\r\nstring of camels, and as soon as they were got in order started off\r\nagain. I led the way, every few minutes striking a light to see how\r\nthe compass was pointing, and to take an anxious look at my watch, for\r\nI was beginning to fear I should not be able to accomplish my task by\r\nthe given time. Our pace was necessarily slow, and our halts frequent,\r\nfor the little party had to be carefully kept together.\r\n\r\nAt last the Jalalabad fort was reached and passed. I then told Hugh\r\nGough, whose squadron was in front, that we had better halt, for\r\nwe could not be far from the Alambagh, and I was afraid that if we\r\napproached in a body we should be fired upon, in which case the\r\ncamel-drivers would assuredly run away, there would be a stampede\r\namongst the camels, and we might find it difficult to make ourselves\r\nknown. I decided it would be best for me to go on alone, and arranged\r\nwith Gough that he should remain where he was until I returned.\r\n\r\nThe Alambagh proved to be farther off than I calculated, and I was\r\nbeginning to fear I had lost my way, when all at once a great wall\r\nloomed in front of me, and I could just make out the figure of the\r\nsentry pacing up and down. I hailed him, and ordered him to ask the\r\nsergeant of the guard to summon the officer on duty. When the latter\r\nappeared, I explained to him my object in coming, and begged him to\r\nhave the ammunition boxes ready for lading by the time I returned with\r\nthe camels. I then rode back to where I had left Gough, and the whole\r\nprocession proceeded to the Alambagh.\r\n\r\nAlready half the night was gone; but beyond the time required for\r\nloading the camels there was no delay; the utmost assistance was\r\nafforded us, and ere long we started on our return journey.\r\n\r\nDay had dawned before we came in sight of the Dilkusha, and by the\r\ntime I had made the ammunition over to the Ordnance officer it was\r\nbroad daylight. As I rode up to the Martinière I could see old Sir\r\nColin, only partially dressed, standing on the steps in evident\r\nanxiety at my non-arrival.\r\n\r\nHe was delighted when at last I appeared, expressed himself very\r\npleased to see me, and, having made many kind and complimentary\r\nremarks as to the success of the little expedition, he told me to go\r\noff and get something to eat as quickly as possible, for we were to\r\nstart directly the men had breakfasted. That was a very happy moment\r\nfor me, feeling that I had earned my Chief's approbation and justified\r\nhis selection of me. I went off to the Artillery camp, and refreshed\r\nthe inner man with a steak cut off a gun bullock which had been killed\r\nby a round shot on the 14th.\r\n\r\nAt 8 a.m. the troops moved off. I was ordered to go with the advance\r\nguard.[10] Hope's and Russell's brigades came next, with Travers's\r\nHeavy battery, Peel's Naval Brigade, and Middleton's Field battery.\r\n\r\nGreathed's brigade (except the 8th Foot left at the Dilkusha), with\r\nBourchier's battery, remained to guard our left flank until mid-day,\r\nwhen it was ordered to follow the column and form its rear guard.\r\n\r\nThe offer of a Native who volunteered to guide us was accepted, and\r\nSir Colin, who rode just behind the advance guard, had Kavanagh with\r\nhim, whose local knowledge proved very valuable.\r\n\r\nThe enemy had been so completely taken in by the previous day's\r\nreconnaissance that they had not the slightest suspicion we should\r\nadvance from our right, the result being that we were allowed to cross\r\nthe canal without opposition.[11] We kept close along the river bank,\r\nour left being partially concealed by the high grass. About a mile\r\nbeyond the canal we turned sharp to the left, and passed through the\r\nnarrow street of a small village, coming immediately under fire from\r\nsome houses on our right, and from the top of a high wall above and\r\nbeyond them, which turned out to be the north-east corner of the\r\nSikandarbagh.\r\n\r\nThe greatest confusion ensued, and for a time there was a complete\r\nblock. The Cavalry in advance were checked by a fierce fire poured\r\ndirectly on them from the front: they were powerless, and the only\r\nthing for them to do was to force their way back, down the confined\r\nlane we had just passed up, which by this time was crammed with\r\nInfantry and Artillery, making 'confusion worse confounded.' As soon\r\nas the Cavalry had cleared out, the 53rd lined the bank which ran\r\nalong the side of the lane nearest the Sikandarbagh, and by their fire\r\ncaused all those of the rebels who had collected outside the walls\r\nto retire within the enclosure. This opened a road for Blunt, who,\r\nleading his guns up the bank with a splendid courage, unlimbered and\r\nopened fire within sixty yards of the building.\r\n\r\nBlunt found himself under a heavy fire from three different\r\ndirections--on the right from the Sikandarbagh; on the left and left\r\nfront from the barracks, some huts (not twenty yards off), and a\r\nserai; and in front from the mess-house, Kaisarbagh, and other\r\nbuildings. In these three directions he pointed his guns, regardless\r\nof deadly fire, especially from the huts on the left.\r\n\r\nIt would, however, have been impossible for the advance guard to have\r\nheld its ground much longer, so it was with a feeling of the utmost\r\nrelief that I beheld Hope's brigade coming up the lane to our\r\nassistance. A company of the 53rd, in the most brilliant manner,\r\nforced the enemy from the position they held on our left front, and\r\nthe Highlanders, without a moment's hesitation, climbed on to the\r\nhuts--the point, as I have already said, from which the heaviest fire\r\nproceeded; they tore off the roofs, and, leaping into the houses,\r\ndrove the enemy before them right through the serai and up to the\r\nbarracks, which they seized, and for the remainder of the operations\r\nthese barracks were held by the 93rd.\r\n\r\nThis action on the part of the Highlanders was as serviceable as it\r\nwas heroic, for it silenced the fire most destructive to the attacking\r\nforce; but for all that, our position was extremely critical, and Sir\r\nColin, perceiving the danger, at once decided that no further move\r\ncould be attempted until we had gained possession of the Sikandarbagh.\r\nIt was, indeed, a formidable-looking place to attack, about 130 yards\r\nsquare, surrounded by a thick brick wall twenty feet high, carefully\r\nloopholed, and flanked at the corners by circular bastions. There\r\nwas only one entrance, a gateway on the south side, protected by\r\na traverse of earth and masonry, over which was a double-storied\r\nguard-room. Close to the north side of the enclosure was a pavilion\r\nwith a flat roof prepared for musketry, and from the whole place an\r\nincessant fire was being kept up.\r\n\r\nSir Colin, in order to get a better view of the position, and thus be\r\nable to decide in what direction the attack could most advantageously\r\nbe made, rode up the bank and placed himself close to one of Blunt's\r\nguns. Mansfield and Hope Grant were on either side, and Augustus\r\nAnson and I were directly behind, when I heard the Commander-in-Chief\r\nexclaim, 'I am hit.' Luckily it was only by a spent bullet, which had\r\npassed through a gunner (killing him on the spot) before it struck Sir\r\nColin on the thigh, causing a severe contusion, but nothing more. It\r\nwas a moment of acute anxiety until it was ascertained that no great\r\ndamage had been done.\r\n\r\nBy this time one of Travers's guns and a howitzer, which with\r\nconsiderable difficulty had been dragged up the bank, opened fire on\r\nthe point selected by Sir Colin for the breach--the south-east corner\r\nof the wall surrounding the Sikandarbagh.[12] Instantly Hardy (Captain\r\nof the battery) was killed and the senior Subaltern wounded: Blunt's\r\ncharger was shot, and of the few men under his command 14 Europeans\r\nand 6 Gun Lascars were killed or wounded; 20 of the troop-horses were\r\nalso knocked over.[13]\r\n\r\nWhile the heavy guns were at work on the breach, Adrian Hope, with the\r\n53rd, cleared off a body of the enemy who had collected on our left\r\nfront, and connected the barracks with the main attack by a line of\r\nskirmishers.\r\n\r\nIn less than half an hour an opening three feet square and three feet\r\nfrom the ground had been made in the wall. It would have been better\r\nhad it been larger, but time was precious; Sir Colin would not wait,\r\nand ordered the assault to begin. The Infantry had been lying down,\r\nunder such slight cover as was available, impatiently awaiting for\r\nthis order. The moment it reached them, up they sprang with\r\none accord, and with one voice uttered a shout which must have\r\nforeshadowed defeat to the defenders of the Sikandarbagh. The 93rd\r\nunder Lieutenant-Colonel Ewart, and the 4th Punjab Infantry under\r\nLieutenant Paul, led the way, closely followed by the 53rd under\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Gordon[14] of the 93rd Highlanders, and one of the\r\nbattalions of Detachments under Major Roger Barnston.\r\n\r\nIt was a magnificent sight, a sight never to be forgotten--that\r\nglorious struggle to be the first to enter the deadly breach, the\r\nprize to the winner of the race being certain death! Highlanders and\r\nSikhs, Punjabi Mahomedans, Dogras[15] and Pathans, all vied with each\r\nother in the generous competition.[16]\r\n\r\nA Highlander was the first to reach the goal, and was shot dead as he\r\njumped into the enclosure; a man of the 4th Punjab Infantry came next,\r\nand met the same fate. Then followed Captain Burroughs and Lieutenant\r\nCooper, of the 93rd, and immediately behind them their Colonel\r\n(Ewart), Captain Lumsden, of the 30th Bengal Infantry,[17] and a\r\nnumber of Sikhs and Highlanders as fast as they could scramble through\r\nthe opening. A drummer-boy of the 93rd must have been one of the first\r\nto pass that grim boundary between life and death, for when I got in\r\nI found him just inside the breach, lying on his back quite dead--a\r\npretty, innocent-looking, fair-haired lad, not more than fourteen\r\nyears of age.\r\n\r\nThe crush now became so great in the men's eagerness to get through\r\nthe opening and join the conflict within, that a regular block was the\r\nconsequence, which every minute became more hopeless. One party\r\nmade for the gateway and another for a barred window[18] close by,\r\ndetermined to force an entrance by them. The traverse having\r\nbeen rushed by the 4th Punjab Infantry gallantly led by a Dogra\r\nSubadar,[19] a Punjabi Mahomedan of this distinguished corps behaved\r\nwith the most conspicuous bravery. The enemy, having been driven out\r\nof the earthwork, made for the gateway, the heavy doors of which were\r\nin the act of being closed, when the Mahomedan (Mukarrab Khan by name)\r\npushed his left arm, on which he carried a shield, between them, thus\r\npreventing their being shut; on his hand being badly wounded by a\r\nsword-cut, he drew it out, instantly thrusting in the other arm, when\r\nthe right hand was all but severed from the wrist.[20] But he gained\r\nhis object--the doors could not be closed, and were soon forced open\r\naltogether, upon which the 4th Punjab Infantry, the 53rd, 93rd, and\r\nsome of the Detachments, swarmed in.\r\n\r\nThis devoted action of Mukarrab Khan I myself witnessed, for, with\r\nAugustus Anson, I got in immediately behind the storming party. As\r\nwe reached the gateway, Anson was knocked off his horse by a bullet,\r\nwhich grazed the base of the skull just behind the right ear, and\r\nstunned him for a moment--the next, he was up and mounted again, but\r\nwas hardly in the saddle when his horse was shot dead.\r\n\r\nThe scene that ensued requires the pen of a Zola to depict. The\r\nrebels, never dreaming that we should stop to attack such a formidable\r\nposition, had collected in the Sikandarbagh to the number of upwards\r\nof 2,000, with the intention of falling upon our right flank so soon\r\nas we should become entangled amongst the streets and houses of the\r\nHazratganj.[21] They were now completely caught in a trap, the only\r\noutlets being by the gateway and the breach, through which our troops\r\ncontinued to pour. There could therefore be no thought of escape, and\r\nthey fought with the desperation of men without hope of mercy, and\r\ndetermined to sell their lives as dearly as they could. Inch by inch\r\nthey were forced back to the pavilion, and into the space between it\r\nand the north wall, where they were all shot or bayoneted. There they\r\nlay in a heap as high as my head, a heaving, surging mass of dead and\r\ndying inextricably entangled. It was a sickening sight, one of those\r\nwhich even in the excitement of battle and the flush of victory make\r\none feel strongly what a horrible side there is to war. The wretched\r\nwounded men could not get clear of their dead comrades, however great\r\ntheir struggles, and those near the top of this ghastly pile of\r\nwrithing humanity vented their rage and disappointment on every\r\nBritish officer who approached by showering upon him abuse of the\r\ngrossest description.\r\n\r\nThe firing and fighting did not cease altogether for some time after\r\nthe main body of the rebels were destroyed. A few got up into the\r\nguard-room above the gateway, and tried to barricade themselves in;\r\nothers sought shelter in the bastions, but none escaped the vengeance\r\nof the soldiers. There were some deadly combats between the mutinous\r\nsepoys and the Sikhs. Eventually all the rebels were killed, save\r\nthree or four who dropped over the wall on the city side. It is to\r\nbe hoped they lived to tell the tale of the dauntless courage which\r\ncarried everything before it.\r\n\r\nConsidering the tremendous odds which those who first entered through\r\nthe breach were exposed to, and the desperate nature of the fighting,\r\nour losses were astonishingly small. The 93rd had 2 officers and 23\r\nmen (including the Sergeant-Major) killed, and 7 officers and 61 men\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nThe 4th Punjab Infantry went into action with four British officers,\r\nof whom two were killed and one was severely wounded. Sixty-nine of\r\nthe Native officers and men were also killed or wounded.[22]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Besides the troops from Delhi, the force consisted of\r\nPeel's Naval Brigade, with eight heavy guns and howitzers; Middleton's\r\nField Battery of Royal Artillery (the first that had ever served in\r\nIndia), and two companies of garrison Royal Artillery, under Travers\r\nand Longden, equipped with heavy guns and mortars; a company of Royal\r\nEngineers under Lieutenant Lennox, V.C.;[*] a few Bengal, and two\r\nnewly-raised companies of Punjab Sappers; the 93rd Highlanders,\r\nHead-Quarters and wing of the 23rd Royal Welsh Fusiliers, and of\r\nthe 53rd Foot; part of the 82nd Foot, and detachments of the 5th\r\nFusiliers, 64th, 78th, 84th, and 90th Foot, and Madras Fusiliers,\r\nregiments which had gone into the Residency with Outram and Havelock.\r\nThe Infantry was brigaded as follows:\r\n\r\n  Wing 53rd Foot              \\\r\n  93rd Highlanders            | Commanded by Brigadier the Hon.\r\n  Battalion of detachments    | Adrian Hope, 93rd Highlanders.\r\n  4th Punjab Infantry         /\r\n\r\n  8th Foot                    \\\r\n  Battalion of detachments    | Commanded by Brigadier Greathed,\r\n  2nd Punjab Infantry         / 8th Foot.\r\n\r\n  Wing 23rd Fusiliers         \\ Commanded by Brigadier D.\r\n  Two companies 82nd Foot     / Russell, 84th Foot.]\r\n\r\n  [*Note: Afterwards General Sir Wilbraham Lennox, V.C., K.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Sir Colin Campbell had served throughout the Punjab\r\nCampaign and on the Peshawar frontier.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Now the 14th (Sikhs) Bengal Infantry.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: During one of Watson's many reconnaissances he received a\r\ncut on the face from a sabre.

Seeing that something unusual had occurred, Browne\r\nrode up to the troop, and found that one of the men had had his saddle\r\ncarried away from under him by a small round shot. The man, who\r\nhappened at the moment to be standing up in his stirrups, escaped with\r\na bruise, as did the horse.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: A kind of more or less responsible servant or messenger,\r\nso called from wearing a chuprass, or badge of office.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: It consisted of Blunt's troop of Horse Artillery, the\r\nwing of the 53rd Foot, and Gough's squadron of Hodson's Horse.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: We had not, however, gone far, when a body of rebel\r\nInfantry, about 2,000 strong, managing to elude Greathed's brigade,\r\ncrossed the canal, and, creeping quietly up, rushed the Martinière.\r\nSir Colin had left Lieutenant Patrick Stewart, an unusually promising\r\nofficer of the Bengal Engineers, on the top of the Martinière to keep\r\nOutram informed of our movements by means of the semaphore, and\r\nwhile Stewart was sending a message he and Watson (who was with him)\r\nobserved the enemy close up to the building. They flew down the\r\nstaircase, jumped on their horses, and, joining Watson's squadron and\r\nthe two Madras Native Horse Artillery guns, rode to the city side\r\nof the Martinière to try and cut off the enemy, who, finding no one\r\ninside the building, and seeing their line of retreat threatened, made\r\nthe best of their way back to the city.

Four guns could then with\r\ndifficulty be manned.

After the fight was over, one of the Native officers,\r\nbemoaning the loss of the British officers, asked me who would be sent\r\nto replace them. He added: '_Sahib, ham log larai men bahut tez hain,\r\nmagar jang ka bandobast nahin jante_' ('Sir, we can fight well, but\r\nwe do not understand military arrangements'). What the old soldier\r\nintended to convey to me was his sense of the inability of himself and\r\nhis comrades to do without the leadership and general management of\r\nthe British officers.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n1857\r\n\r\n  Henry Norman--The Shah Najaf--The mess-house--Planting the flag\r\n  --A memorable meeting--The Residency\r\n\r\n\r\nThe operation which I have tried to describe in the last chapter\r\nwas not completed until well on in the afternoon, when the movement\r\ntowards the Residency was at once proceeded with. To the left as we\r\nadvanced the ground was fairly open (with the exception of quite a\r\nsmall village) for about 1,100 yards in the direction of the British\r\nInfantry mess-house. To the right also, for about 300 yards, there was\r\na clear space, then a belt of jungle intersected by huts and small\r\ngardens extending for about 400 yards farther, as far as the Shah\r\nNajaf,[1] a handsome white-domed tomb, surrounded by a court-yard, and\r\nenclosed by high masonry loopholed walls; and beyond the Shah Najaf\r\nrose the Kadam Rasul,[2] another tomb standing on a slight eminence.\r\n\r\nBut little opposition was experienced from the village, which was\r\ncarried by the Infantry, while the Artillery were brought up to open\r\nfire on the Shah Najaf and Kadam Rasul. The latter was soon occupied\r\nby the 2nd Punjab Infantry, belonging to Greathed's brigade, which had\r\nby this time joined the main body; but the Shah Najaf proved a harder\r\nnut to crack. This building was almost concealed by dense jungle, and\r\nits great strength therefore remained unsuspected until we got quite\r\nclose up to it.\r\n\r\nBarnston's battalion of Detachments advanced in skirmishing order,\r\nunder cover of our guns. One of the shells most unfortunately burst\r\nprematurely, wounding Major Barnston so severely that he died soon\r\nafterwards. Whether it was that the men were depressed by the loss of\r\ntheir leader, or that they were not prepared for the very damaging\r\nfire which suddenly poured upon them, I know not, but certain it is\r\nthat they wavered, and for a few minutes there was a slight panic. The\r\nCommander-in-Chief, with Hope Grant, Mansfield, Adrian Hope, and their\r\nrespective staffs, were sitting on their horses anxiously awaiting the\r\nresult of the attack, when all at once it became apparent that there\r\nwas a retrograde movement on the part of some of the men, who were\r\nemerging from the belt of jungle and hastening towards us. Norman\r\nwas the first to grasp the situation. Putting spurs to his horse,\r\nhe galloped into their midst, and called on them to pull themselves\r\ntogether; the men rallied at once, and advanced into the cover from\r\nwhich they had for the moment retreated. I had many opportunities for\r\nnoting Norman's coolness and presence of mind under fire. On this\r\nparticular occasion these qualities were most marked, and his action\r\nwas most timely.\r\n\r\nMore Infantry were brought up, but without avail. The enemy evidently\r\nwere determined to prevent the capture of the Shah Najaf. Fire was now\r\nopened upon us from a heavy gun on the other side of the Gumti (the\r\nfirst shot from which blew up one of the ammunition waggons belonging\r\nto the Naval Brigade), and all the cannon that were collected at the\r\nKaisarbagh and mess-house were brought to bear upon us. The musketry\r\nfire was incessant, and Peel's men suffered so severely that one of\r\nhis guns could not be worked.\r\n\r\nSir Colin was beginning to get extremely anxious, and no wonder--the\r\nposition was most uncomfortable, and the prospect very gloomy. Three\r\nhours since the attack began! The day was rapidly drawing to a close,\r\nand we were no nearer our object; on the contrary, the opposition\r\nbecame every moment stronger, and the fire more deadly. A retreat was\r\nnot to be thought of; indeed, our remaining so long stationary had\r\nbeen an encouragement to the enemy, and every one felt that the only\r\nchance for the little British army fighting against 30,000 desperate\r\nmutineers, with every advantage of position and intimate knowledge of\r\nlocality in their favour, was to continue to advance at all hazards;\r\nand this our gallant old Chief decided to do. Placing himself at the\r\nhead of the 93rd, he explained to the only too eager Highlanders the\r\ndangerous nature of the service, and called on them to follow him.\r\nThere was no mistaking the response; cheer after cheer rent the air\r\nas they listened to the words of the Chief they knew so well, and\r\nbelieved in so thoroughly, assuring him of their readiness to follow\r\nwhithersoever he should lead, do whatever he should direct. They moved\r\noff, followed by Peel's guns dragged by sailors and some of the Madras\r\nFusiliers, the advance of the party being covered by Middleton's Field\r\nbattery, which dashed to the front and opened with grape.\r\n\r\nAlmost instantaneously the narrow path along which we were proceeding\r\nwas choked with wounded officers and dead and struggling horses. It\r\nwas here that Sir Archibald Alison, Sir Colin's Aide-de-camp, lost his\r\narm, and his brother (another Aide-de-camp) was wounded. Adrian Hope's\r\nhorse was shot dead--indeed, very few escaped injury, either to\r\nthemselves or their horses. I was one of the lucky few. On reaching\r\nthe wall of the Shah Najaf enclosure, it was found to be twenty feet\r\nhigh, no entrance could be seen, and there were no scaling-ladders\r\navailable, so there was nothing for it but to endeavour to breach the\r\nmassive wall.[3] The 24-pounders hammered away at it for some time,\r\nbut proved quite unequal to the task; though only a few yards off,\r\nthey made no impression whatever, and it seemed as if the attempt to\r\ntake the position must be abandoned. Peel was, therefore, ordered to\r\nwithdraw his guns under cover of some rockets, which were discharged\r\ninto the enclosure, and Hope was directed to retire as soon as he\r\ncould collect the killed and wounded.\r\n\r\nCaptain Allgood, Sir Colin's trusted Assistant Quartermaster-General,\r\nwas the bearer of the order. He and Hope, after consulting together,\r\ndetermined that before the latter obeyed they would try to discover\r\nif there did not exist an opening in some other part of the walls.\r\nAssisted by a sergeant of the 93rd, they set about their search, and\r\nactually did find a narrow gap, through which they could see that the\r\nenemy, terrified and thrown into confusion by the exploding rockets\r\nfalling amongst them, were fast abandoning the building. The two\r\nfriends helped each other through the gap, and, followed by some\r\nHighlanders, they proceeded across the now deserted enclosure to\r\nsecure the only gateway, which was on the opposite side to that which\r\nwe had attacked; and Allgood had the great pleasure of announcing\r\nto the Commander-in-Chief that there was no need to retire, for the\r\nformidable position was in our possession.\r\n\r\nIt was getting dark when at length we occupied the Shah Najaf; some of\r\nus got on to the top of the building to take a look round. There was\r\njust light enough to show us a sepoy sauntering unconcernedly up to\r\nthe gate, evidently in happy ignorance of what had happened. He soon\r\ndiscovered that his comrades were no longer masters of the situation,\r\nand, letting his musket fall, he made all haste to the river, into\r\nwhich he dropped, and swam to the other side.\r\n\r\nSir Colin and my General took up their quarters in the Shah Najaf, but\r\nonly nominally, for after a scratch dinner we all joined the troops,\r\nwho bivouacked where they stood.\r\n\r\nThe force was disposed in a semicircle, extending from the Shah\r\nNajaf to the barracks. The wounded were placed in the huts near the\r\nSikandarbagh, where they passed a most comfortless night, for when\r\nthe sun set it rapidly got cold, and the hospital arrangements were\r\nnecessarily on a very limited scale.\r\n\r\nBy this time I was dead beat, having been for sixty hours continually\r\nin the saddle, except when I lay down for a short nap on the night of\r\nthe 14th.\r\n\r\nWe were not allowed, however, to have a very long night's rest. Hours\r\nbefore dawn on the 17th we were roused by the beating of drums and\r\nringing of bells (an impotent attempt on the part of the rebel leaders\r\nto excite the enthusiasm of their followers), which caused the troops\r\nto prepare for an attack and stand to their arms. But the enemy were\r\nnot in a mood to encounter us in the open, small as our numbers were;\r\nthey had suffered heavily the day before, and they must have begun to\r\nrealize that their strongest positions were inadequate against British\r\npluck and determination.\r\n\r\nThe mess-house was the next point to be carried, but the\r\nCommander-in-Chief thought it would be prudent to make our left quite\r\nsecure in the first instance. The duty of occupying the houses and\r\ngardens situated between the barracks and Banks's house was entrusted\r\nto Brigadier Russell. Four bungalows,[4] in which the officers of the\r\n32nd Foot had lived, were first seized. Russell then pushed on towards\r\nBanks's house, which it was necessary to occupy, as it commanded the\r\ncrossing over the canal, by which we communicated with the Dilkusha,\r\nand by which it was thought that the people rescued from the Residency\r\nwould have to be brought away. Russell, avoiding the main road,\r\nadvanced under cover of his Artillery, and forced the rebels to\r\nvacate this important position, and Banks's house was held during the\r\nremainder of the operations by 50 men of the 2nd Punjab Infantry,\r\nunder Lieutenant F. Keen.[5]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a heavy fire from Peel's guns had been opened on the\r\nmess-house--a double-storied building, situated on slightly rising\r\nground, surrounded by a ditch 12 feet broad, and beyond that at some\r\nlittle distance by a loop-holed wall.\r\n\r\nOur losses on the previous day had been very severe, and Sir Colin,\r\nanxious to spare his men as much as possible, decided to batter the\r\nplace freely with Artillery before permitting it to be attacked.\r\nPeel's guns and Longden's mortars were therefore brought to bear upon\r\nit, and kept up a continual fire until 3 p.m., when the enemy seemed\r\nto think they had had enough, their musketry fire slackened off, and\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief, considering the assault might safely be made,\r\ngave the order to advance. The attacking party was commanded by\r\nBrevet-Major Wolseley,[6] of the 90th Light Infantry, and consisted of\r\na company of his own regiment, a piquet of the 53rd Foot under Captain\r\nHopkins, and a few men of the 2nd Punjab Infantry under Captain\r\nPowlett, supported by Barnston's Detachments, under Captain Guise, of\r\nthe 90th.\r\n\r\nThe building and its many outhouses were carried with a rush, and\r\nthe enemy, who hastily retreated to the Moti Mahal,[7] were followed\r\nacross the road, where our troops were stopped by the high wall which\r\nenclosed that building. Wolseley then sent for some Sappers, who\r\nquickly opened out a space through which they all passed. The Moti\r\nMahal was hotly defended, but without avail, and ere the sun set the\r\nlast position which separated the relieved from the relieving forces\r\nwas in our possession.\r\n\r\nAs the party moved off to attack the mess-house, Sir Colin, who, on\r\nhis white horse, was interestedly watching the proceedings, ordered me\r\nto procure a regimental colour and place it on one of the turrets\r\nof the building, that Outram might be able to judge how far we had\r\nadvanced. I rode off accordingly to the 2nd Punjab Infantry, standing\r\nclose by, and requested the Commandant, Captain Green, to let me have\r\none of his colours. He at once complied, and I galloped with it to the\r\nmess-house. As I entered, I was met by Sir David Baird (one of Sir\r\nColin's Aides-de-camp), and Captain Hopkins, of the 53rd Foot, by both\r\nof whom I was assisted in getting the flag with its long staff up the\r\ninconveniently narrow staircase, and in planting it on the turret\r\nnearest the Kaisarbagh, which was about 850 yards off. No sooner did\r\nthe enemy perceive what we were about, than shot after shot was aimed\r\nat the colour, and in a very few minutes it was knocked over, falling\r\ninto the ditch below. I ran down, picked it up, and again placed it in\r\nposition, only for it to be once more shot down and hurled into the\r\nditch, just as Norman and Lennox (who had been sent by Sir Colin to\r\nreport what was going on in the interior of the Kaisarbagh) appeared\r\non the roof. Once more I picked up the colour, and found that this\r\ntime the staff had been broken in two. Notwithstanding, I managed\r\nto prop it up a third time on the turret, and it was not again hit,\r\nthough the enemy continued to fire at it for some time.\r\n\r\nOutram, unwilling to risk unnecessary loss of men, did not greatly\r\nextend his position until he was sure we were close at hand, but he\r\nwas not idle. While Sir Colin was slowly working his way towards him\r\non the 16th, he had gradually occupied such buildings as lay in the\r\ndirection of our advance. From the mess-house we could see the British\r\nflag flying on the top of the engine-house, only a short distance\r\nbeyond the Moti Mahal, which satisfactory piece of intelligence Norman\r\nwent down to report to Sir Colin, who, with his Chief of the Staff,\r\nhad just arrived. I followed Norman, and we two made our way to the\r\nwestern wall of the Pearl Palace enclosure, outside which Outram and\r\nHavelock were standing together. They had run the gauntlet of the\r\nenemy's fire in coming from the engine house; Colonel Robert Napier\r\nand two other officers who accompanied them, having been wounded, had\r\nto be carried back. Some of Lennox's Sappers set to work, and soon\r\nmade a hole in the wall[8] large enough for these two distinguished\r\nmen to pass through.\r\n\r\nI had never before met either of them. In Afghanistan Outram had been\r\na friend of my father, who had often spoken to me about him in terms\r\nof the warmest admiration, and his courage and chivalry were known and\r\nappreciated throughout India. It was therefore with feelings of the\r\nmost lively interest that I beheld this man, whose character I so\r\ngreatly admired. He was then fifty-four years of age, strong and\r\nbroad-shouldered, in no way broken down by the heavy load of\r\nresponsibility and anxiety he had had to bear, or the hardships he had\r\ngone through. Havelock, the hero of a hundred fights, on the contrary,\r\nlooked ill, worn and depressed, but brightened up a little when Norman\r\ntold him he had been made a K.C.B.\r\n\r\nSir Colin waited to receive these two heroes on the ground sloping\r\ndown from the mess-house, and it was there that the meeting between\r\nthe three veterans took place. A most impressive and memorable scene\r\nwas that meeting, which has been well depicted in the historical\r\npicture by Barker.\r\n\r\nAs if to show the rage and disappointment of the enemy at this\r\nevidence of the success of our operations, every gun in the Kaisarbagh\r\nwas turned upon us, and it was under a shower of shot and shell that\r\nthe interview was held; it did not last long, for it was neither the\r\ntime nor the place to discuss plans for the future. All Sir Colin\r\ncould then say was that the troops should be removed outside Lucknow\r\nas soon as the women and children had been brought away, and he\r\nexpressed his 'thankfulness that the relief of the garrison had been\r\naccomplished.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAJOR-GENERAL SIR JAMES OUTRAM, G.C.B.\r\n_From a painting by Thomas Brigstocke, R.A._]\r\n\r\nNorman and I obtained permission to accompany Outram and Havelock back\r\nto the Residency. It was intensely but painfully interesting to visit\r\nthis scene of so many acts of heroism, and of so much suffering\r\nendured with unexampled fortitude. We first went to the posts occupied\r\nby Havelock's force in the Chatta Manzil, and in other buildings which\r\nhave long since disappeared. At one of these we stopped to watch the\r\nArtillery trying to silence the enemy's guns on the opposite side of\r\nthe river. We talked to the men, who were keen to hear news from the\r\nouter world and the story of our advance. It was some little time\r\nbefore we discovered in one of them the Commander of the battery,\r\nCaptain William Olpherts,[9] for in his soiled and torn summer\r\nclothing, his face thin, worn, and begrimed with smoke, it was\r\ndifficult to distinguish the officer from his men, and it was under\r\nthese levelling circumstances that I had the honour of making the\r\nacquaintance of my distinguished brother officer, whose audacious\r\ncourage on the occasion of Havelock's advance over the Charbagh bridge\r\nhad won the admiration of everyone in the force, and gained for him\r\nthe Victoria Cross.\r\n\r\nWe next came to the Bailey-guard; and as we looked at the battered\r\nwalls and gateway, not an inch without a mark from a round shot or\r\nbullet, we marvelled that Aitken and Loughman could have managed to\r\ndefend it for nearly five months. There was plenty of evidence on all\r\nthe surrounding buildings of the dangerous nature of the service which\r\nthey and their gallant Native comrades had so admirably performed.\r\nAlthough we were pressed for time, we could not resist stopping to\r\nspeak to some of the Native officers and sepoys, whose magnificent\r\nloyalty throughout the siege was one of the most gratifying features\r\nof the Mutiny.\r\n\r\nAt length we came to the Residency itself, where we met a few old\r\nfriends and acquaintances, who welcomed us with the most touching\r\nenthusiasm. Mrs. (afterwards Lady) Inglis and the Rev. J.P. Harris and\r\nhis wife I had known at Peshawar; there were also Mrs. Fletcher Hayes,\r\nthe widow of the poor fellow whose murder by the men of his own escort\r\nnear Mainpuri I have related, and Mrs. Case, the widow of the brave\r\nMajor of the 32nd, who lost his life at the affair of Chinhut. Mrs.\r\nInglis showed us the tiny room which she and her children had shared\r\nwith Mrs. Case all through the siege; but it was difficult to get any\r\nof them to speak of their miserable experiences, which were too sad\r\nand terrible, and too recent to be talked about, and they naturally\r\npreferred to dwell on their thankfulness for the relief that had come\r\nat last, and to listen to our account of what had happened in other\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nIt was too late then to go round the position; that had to be left\r\nfor another day; indeed, it was quite dark when we returned to\r\nHead-Quarters, established by our Chief in the open, his soldierly\r\ninstincts prompting him to remain with his troops.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Shah Najaf is the tomb of Ghazi-ud-din Haidar, first King\r\nof Oudh, built by himself.

Before daybreak the next\r\nmorning the troops were under arms. Thousands of the enemy had\r\ncollected in the Kaisarbagh, and for the protection of the mess-house,\r\nthe Tara Koti, about 200 yards to the south-west, was seized and held,\r\nas from this position a flanking fire could be brought to bear upon\r\nany enemy advancing from the Kaisarbagh.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult part of Sir Colin's task had yet to be\r\naccomplished--the bringing away of the women and children, and the\r\nsick and wounded, from the Residency--and the question of how this\r\ncould best be done was one which caused the Commander-in-Chief much\r\nanxious thought. Many, amongst whom were Outram and Hope Grant,\r\npressed him to attack the Kaisarbagh and capture the city in the first\r\ninstance; but 45 officers and 496 men out of our small force had been\r\nkilled or wounded; Sir Colin, therefore, decided that it would be to\r\nthe last degree imprudent to attempt such an undertaking with his\r\nreduced numbers, and became more than ever determined to confine his\r\noperations to the relief of the garrison.\r\n\r\nThat the Chief was right there can be no room for doubt. This force\r\nwas barely strong enough for the service it had to perform. Every man\r\nwas on duty day and night; there was no reserve to fall back upon; and\r\nhad he listened to these proposals, and allowed himself to be drawn\r\ninto complications in the city, it is more than probable that those\r\nhe had come to succour would have been sacrificed. The wisdom of his\r\ndecision was fully proved by subsequent events, and unreservedly\r\nacknowledged by Hope Grant and others who at the time differed from\r\nhim in their ideas of the course which should be adopted.\r\n\r\nFrom the Dilkusha to the Residency was not less than five miles; every\r\nyard of the way had to be guarded, and the garrison at the former\r\nplace was so attenuated that it had to be reinforced by the withdrawal\r\nof part of the 75th Foot from the Alambagh. Fortunately this could be\r\ndone without dangerously weakening that post, as it had been lately\r\nstrengthened by the arrival of a small body of troops from Cawnpore.\r\n\r\nIt had now to be settled whether the evacuation should be effected\r\nby the route we had ourselves followed, which was circuitous and in\r\nplaces difficult for the wheeled vehicles necessary for the conveyance\r\nof the sick and wounded, and the women and children; or by the way\r\npast the barracks and Banks's house, which was shorter and had the\r\nadvantage of a metalled road throughout. But unless Russell, whose\r\nbrigade was in position at the barracks, could make the latter line\r\nsecure, it would be too hazardous to adopt, and up to the present the\r\nreports from Russell had not been very promising. He had been\r\nhardly pressed on the 17th, and had sent word that he could make no\r\nimpression on the enemy without heavy guns. Colonel Biddulph, the\r\nDeputy-Quartermaster-General, was therefore ordered to proceed to\r\nthe barracks to ascertain how guns could best be sent to Russell's\r\nassistance, and report to the Commander-in-Chief on the whole\r\nsituation. I was told to go with him and bring back the required\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nWe found Russell in a very uncomfortable position, exposed to a hot\r\nfire and closely surrounded by the enemy, who were holding the British\r\nInfantry hospital and other buildings within a few yards of him.\r\n\r\nI remained with Russell while Biddulph reconnoitred the ground between\r\nthe barracks, the canal, and the Sikandarbagh. It was found covered\r\nwith villages and walled enclosures, but he discovered a path secure\r\nfrom the enemy's fire, along which he was able to bring to Russell's\r\nassistance a 9-pounder gun, a 24-pounder howitzer, and four 5-1/2-inch\r\nmortars. As the 9-pounder was fired, a round shot from one of the\r\nenemy's 18-pounders struck the mud wall immediately in front of it,\r\nscattering great clods of earth, which knocked over Bourchier and\r\nanother officer; the round shot then hit Brigadier Russell, just\r\ngrazing the back of his neck, actually cutting his watch-chain in two,\r\nand causing partial paralysis of the lower limbs for some days.\r\n\r\nRussell being for the time _hors de combat_, Biddulph assumed command,\r\nand ordered me to return to Head-Quarters, report what had happened,\r\nand inform Sir Colin that he intended to attack the hospital and\r\nendeavour to drive the enemy out of his immediate neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nI never saw Biddulph again. I had scarcely delivered my message to the\r\nChief when heavy firing was heard from the direction of the barracks,\r\nand shortly afterwards a determined attack was made by the rebels on\r\nthe piquets placed between the Sikandarbagh and the barracks, which\r\nwas repulsed by Remmington's troop of Horse Artillery, with two\r\ncompanies of Infantry belonging to the 23rd and 53rd Foot, brought up\r\nby the Commander-in-Chief himself, who expressed to Remmington his\r\nwarm approval of the brilliant manner in which his troop had come into\r\naction.\r\n\r\nSir Colin now received information that Biddulph was killed, and that\r\nHale, who succeeded to the command of the brigade, had attacked and\r\ntaken the hospital, but had been forced to abandon it, as the thatched\r\nroof had been set on fire by the shells showered upon it by the enemy,\r\nwho were keeping our troops constantly on the alert. This decided Sir\r\nColin to give up the idea of withdrawing the relieved garrison by\r\nBanks's house.\r\n\r\nEarly on the following morning, the 19th, I was sent by the\r\nCommander-in-Chief to the Residency with a note for Sir James Outram,\r\ncontaining the information that arrangements for the withdrawal were\r\nnow complete, and that conveyances for the women, children, sick, and\r\nwounded would be sent as soon as they arrived from the Dilkusha.\r\n\r\nWhen he had read the note Sir James questioned me as to the road, and\r\nasked me particularly if I had noticed the openings made in the walls\r\nof houses and enclosures, and whether I thought they were large enough\r\nfor the guns, carts, and carriages to get through. I replied that I\r\nhad not observed them very particularly, but I was inclined to\r\nthink some of them were certainly rather small. My answer, to my\r\nastonishment, roused the ire of a wounded officer lying on a couch at\r\nthe end of the room, for he wrathfully asked me whether I had measured\r\nthe openings, and on my saying I had not, he added: 'You had better\r\nwait to give your opinion until you know what you are talking about;\r\nthose openings were made by my orders, and I am quite sure they are\r\nthe necessary size.' The officer was no other than Colonel Robert\r\nNapier, who, as I have already stated, was badly wounded on the 17th.\r\nI felt myself considerably snubbed, but Sir James kindly came to the\r\nrescue, and explained that I had merely answered his question and had\r\nnot offered any opinion of my own: Colonel Napier, however, was not\r\nto be appeased, and I could plainly see that I had incurred his\r\ndispleasure, and that he thought me a very bumptious youngster. I do\r\nnot know whether the Chief of the Staff[1] ever heard of it, but it\r\nwas some satisfaction to me to find afterwards that I was right in my\r\nestimation of the size of those apertures, some of which had to be\r\nenlarged before the guns and carriages could pass through.\r\n\r\nBy sunset that day the women and children had been brought away and\r\ncollected in the Sikandarbagh. Not a very agreeable resting-place, for\r\nthough the 2,000 dead mutineers had been got out of sight, they were\r\nmerely slightly covered over in a ditch which they themselves had\r\nrecently dug outside the north wall to strengthen the defences. The\r\nsurvivors of the siege, however, had become too inured to horrors of\r\nall kinds, and were too thankful for their deliverance from the fate\r\nwhich for months had constantly threatened them, to be over-sensitive.\r\n\r\nIt was a sad little assemblage; all were more or less broken down and\r\nout of health, while many were widows or orphans, having left their\r\nnearest and dearest in the Residency burial-ground. Officers and men\r\naccorded them a respectful welcome, and by their efforts to help them\r\nshowed how deeply they felt for their forlorn condition, while our old\r\nChief had a comfortable tea prepared for them. When night set in, the\r\nroad having been carefully reconnoitred beforehand, the melancholy\r\nconvoy with its guard of soldiers started for the Dilkusha, where it\r\narrived in safety, and was warmly received by the officers of the 9th\r\nLancers and the rest of the garrison, who did all that circumstances\r\nwould allow to make the ladies and children comfortable.\r\n\r\nDuring the 20th, 21st, and 22nd, everything that was worth removing\r\nand for which carriage could be provided was brought away. Such a\r\nmiscellaneous collection it was--jewels and other valuables belonging\r\nto the ex-royal family, twenty-five lakhs of treasure, stores of all\r\nkinds, including grain, and as many of the 200 guns discovered in the\r\npalace as were considered likely to be of use.\r\n\r\nThe troops were not moved away from the Residency till midnight on the\r\n22nd, and I had several opportunities before then of going over the\r\nposition, to every point of which some thrilling story was attached,\r\nand of renewing acquaintance with many of the garrison whom I had\r\nknown before. Amongst them was Sam Lawrence, of the 32nd Foot, a\r\nfriend of Peshawar days, who, for his gallant defence of the Redan,\r\nwas awarded the Victoria Cross. I was shown Innes's advanced post,\r\nnamed after McLeod Innes,[2] a talented Engineer officer, who also\r\nsubsequently gained that coveted reward; the Cawnpore battery, where\r\nso many valuable lives had been sacrificed, and the room where Sir\r\nHenry Lawrence received his mortal wound; then I climbed up to the\r\ntower, from which a good view of the city and the posts held by the\r\nenemy could be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe more I saw, the more I wondered at what had been achieved by such\r\na mere handful of men against such vast numbers. It was specially\r\npleasant to me to listen to the praises bestowed on the officers of my\r\nown regiment, of whom nine were present when the siege commenced, and\r\nonly one escaped to the end unwounded, while five were killed or died\r\nof their injuries. Of the other three, one was wounded three different\r\ntimes, and both the others once.\r\n\r\nAll were loud, too, in their praises of the Engineer officers. During\r\nthe latter part of the siege the rebels, finding they could not carry\r\nthe position by assault, tried hard to undermine the defences; but our\r\nEngineers were ever on the watch, and countermined so successfully\r\nthat they were able to frustrate the enemy's designs on almost every\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful manner in which the Hindustani soldiers held their\r\nground, notwithstanding that they were incessantly taunted by their\r\nmutinous comrades for aiding the Feringhis against their own people,\r\nwas also much dilated upon.\r\n\r\nThe casualties during the siege were extremely heavy. When it\r\ncommenced on the 1st of July, the strength of the garrison was 927\r\nEuropeans and 765 Natives. Of the former, 163 were civilians--brave\r\nand useful, but untrained to arms; of the latter, 118 were pensioners,\r\nmany of whom were old and decrepit. Up to the arrival of Outram and\r\nHavelock (a period of eighty-seven days), 350 Europeans and 133\r\nnatives were either killed or died of wounds and disease. Of the noble\r\nand unselfish conduct of the ladies and soldiers' wives, everyone\r\nspoke in the highest terms and with the warmest appreciation. They\r\nsuffered, without a murmur, the most terrible hardships; they devoted\r\nthemselves to the sick and wounded in the hospital, and were ever\r\nready to help in any way that was useful. Two ladies were killed, and\r\nnine died, during the siege.\r\n\r\nThe contemplation of the defence of Lucknow, and the realization of\r\nthe noble qualities it called forth in the defenders, cannot but\r\nexcite in the breast of every British man and woman, as it did in\r\nmine, feelings of pride and admiration. But what impressed me more\r\nthan even the glorious defence was the foresight and ability of the\r\nman who made that defence possible.\r\n\r\nHenry Lawrence was, apparently, the only European in India who, from\r\nthe very first, formed an accurate estimate of the extent of the\r\ndanger which threatened our rule in the early part of 1857, and who,\r\nnotwithstanding his thorough appreciation of the many good qualities\r\nof Native soldiers, was not misled into a mistaken belief in the\r\nabsolute loyalty of the Native army. Fourteen years before Lawrence\r\nhad predicted the Mutiny[3] and the course it would take, and when\r\nevents shaped themselves as he had foreseen, he gave it as his opinion\r\nthat the disaffection would be general and widespread. But while his\r\nintimate knowledge of Native character led him to this conviction,\r\nso great was his influence with Natives--perhaps by reason of that\r\nknowledge--that he was able to delay the actual outbreak at Lucknow\r\nuntil his measures for the defence of the Residency were completed,\r\nand he persuaded a considerable number of sepoys, not only to continue\r\nin their allegiance, but to share with their European comrades the\r\ndangers and privations of the siege--a priceless service, for without\r\ntheir aid the defence could not have been made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRIGADIER-GENERAL SIR HENRY LAWRENCE, K.C.B.\r\n_From a photograph taken at Lucknow._]\r\n\r\nIn no part of India was there greater need for the services of a\r\nstrong, enlightened, and sympathetic Ruler and Statesman. Difficult as\r\nwere the positions in which many men in authority were placed in\r\n1857, none was more difficult than that in which Henry Lawrence found\r\nhimself when he took over the Chief Commissionership of Oudh in the\r\nspring of that year. His colleagues in the administration were at\r\nfeud with each other, and by their ignorance of the proper methods of\r\ndealing with the people they had succeeded in alienating all classes.\r\n\r\nWhile Lawrence was engaged in pouring oil on these troubled waters,\r\nand in earning the gratitude of the people by modifying the previous\r\nyear's undue assessment, signs appeared of the disaffection, which\r\nhad begun amongst the troops at Barrackpore, having spread to the\r\ncantonments in Oudh. Sir Henry met this new trouble in the same\r\nintelligent and conciliatory spirit as that in which he had dealt with\r\nhis civil difficulties. He summoned to a durbar some Native officers\r\nwho had displayed a very proper feeling of loyalty by arresting\r\nseveral fanatics who had tried to tamper with the soldiery, and he\r\nliberally rewarded them, pointing out at the same time in forcible\r\nlanguage the disgrace to a soldier of being faithless to his salt. But\r\nwhile doing everything in his power to keep the Natives loyal, and\r\nwith a certain amount of success, he did not neglect to take every\r\npossible precaution.\r\n\r\nWhen first he heard of the outbreak at Meerut, he telegraphed to the\r\nGovernor-General advising him to send for British troops to China and\r\nCeylon, and to call on the Nepalese to assist; at the same time\r\nhe applied to Lord Canning for, and obtained, the rank of\r\nBrigadier-General, which gave him military as well as civil control--a\r\nvery necessary measure, for none of the senior military officers in\r\nOudh were men to be relied upon; indeed, as in so many other places,\r\nthey had to be effaced when the troubles began.\r\n\r\nVery early in the day Henry Lawrence commenced his preparations for\r\nthe defence of the Residency; he cleared the ground of all cover\r\nin its immediate vicinity, as far as it was possible to do so; he\r\nfortified it, mounted guns, stored ammunition, powder, and firewood;\r\narranged for a proper supply of water; collected food, which proved\r\nsufficient, not only for the original number of refugees, but for the\r\n3,000 additional mouths belonging to Outram and Havelock's force; in\r\nfact, he did everything which forethought and ingenuity could suggest\r\nto enable the garrison to hold out in what he foresaw would be a long\r\nand deadly struggle against fearful odds. There was no fort, as there\r\nwas at Agra, capable of sheltering every European in Oudh, and strong\r\nenough to defy any number of mutineers, nor was there, as at Cawnpore,\r\na well-stocked and strongly-fortified magazine to depend upon. But\r\nHenry Lawrence was not cast down by the difficulties which surrounded\r\nhim; he was fully alive to the danger, but he recognized that his\r\nbest, indeed, his only, chance of delaying the inevitable rebellion\r\nuntil (as he hoped) assistance might arrive, was to show a bold front.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th May Lawrence wrote to Lord Canning as follows: 'Hitherto\r\nthe country has been kept quiet, and we have played the Irregulars\r\nagainst the line regiments; but being constituted of exactly the same\r\nmaterial, the taint is fast pervading them, and in a few weeks, if not\r\ndays--unless Delhi be in the interim captured--there will be but one\r\nfeeling throughout the army, a feeling that our prestige is gone, and\r\nthat feeling will be more dangerous than any other. Religion, fear,\r\nhatred, one and all have their influence; but there is still a\r\nreverence for the Company's _ikbâl_[4]--when it is gone we shall have\r\nfew friends indeed. The tone and talk of many have greatly altered\r\nduring the last few days, and we are now asked, almost in terms of\r\ninsolence, whether Delhi is captured, or when it will be. It was\r\nonly just after the Kabul massacre, and when we hesitated to advance\r\nthrough the Khyber, that, in my memory, such a tone ever before\r\nprevailed.[5]\r\n\r\nFeeling all this so strongly, it is the more remarkable that Henry\r\nLawrence never lost heart, but struggled bravely on 'to preserve the\r\nsoldiery to their duty and the people to their allegiance,' while\r\nat the same time he was, as I have shown, making every conceivable\r\npreparation to meet the outbreak whenever it should come.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that Henry Lawrence was a very remarkable man; his\r\nfriendly feeling for Natives, and his extraordinary insight into\r\ntheir character, together with his military training and his varied\r\npolitical experience, peculiarly fitted him to be at the head of a\r\nGovernment at such a crisis.[6]\r\n\r\nAll this, however, is a digression from my narrative, to which I must\r\nnow return.\r\n\r\nWhile the withdrawal was being effected, Peel's guns distracted the\r\nenemy's attention from the proceedings by keeping up a perpetual and\r\ndestructive fire on the Kaisarbagh, thus leading the rebels to believe\r\nthat our whole efforts were directed to taking that place. By the\r\nevening of the 22nd three large breaches had been made, and the enemy\r\nnaturally expected an assault to take place the next morning. But the\r\nobject of that heavy fire had already been accomplished; the women and\r\nchildren, the sick and wounded, were all safe in the Dilkusha; no one\r\nwas left in the Residency but the garrison, on duty for the last time\r\nat the posts they had so long and so bravely defended, and they were\r\nto leave at midnight.\r\n\r\nAs the clock struck twelve, in the deepest silence and with the utmost\r\ncaution, the gallant little band evacuated the place, and passed down\r\nthe long line of posts, first those held by Outram's and Havelock's\r\nmen, and then those occupied by the relieving force, until they\r\nreached the Martinière Park. As they moved on, Outram's and Havelock's\r\ntroops fell in behind, and were followed by the relieving force, which\r\nbrought up the rear. The scheme for this very delicate movement had\r\nbeen most carefully considered beforehand by General Mansfield, the\r\nclever Chief of the Staff, who clearly explained to all concerned the\r\nparts they had to play, and emphatically impressed upon them that\r\nsuccess depended on his directions being followed to the letter, and\r\non their being carried out without the slightest noise or confusion.\r\n\r\nSir Colin Campbell and Hope Grant, surrounded by their respective\r\nstaffs, watched the movement from a position in front of the\r\nSikandarbagh, where a body of Artillery and Infantry were held in\r\nreadiness for any emergency. When the time arrived for the advanced\r\npiquets to be drawn in, the enemy seemed to have become suspicious,\r\nfor they suddenly opened fire with guns and musketry from the\r\nKaisarbagh, and for a moment we feared our plans had been discovered.\r\nFortunately, one of Peel's rocket-carts was still in position beyond\r\nthe Moti Mahal, and the celerity with which the officer in charge\r\nreplied to this burst of fire apparently convinced the enemy we were\r\nholding our ground, for the firing soon ceased, and we breathed again.\r\n\r\nMansfield had taken the precaution to have with him an officer from\r\nHale's brigade, which was on the left rear of our line of posts, that\r\nhe might go back and tell his Brigadier when the proper time came for\r\nthe latter to move off in concert with the rest of the force; but this\r\nofficer had not, apparently, understood that he would have to return\r\nin the dark, and when Mansfield directed him to carry out the duty for\r\nwhich he had been summoned, he replied that he did not think he could\r\nfind his way. Mansfield was very angry, and with reason, for it was\r\nof supreme importance that the retirement should be simultaneous, and\r\nturning to me, he said: 'You have been to Hale's position: do you\r\nthink you could find your way there now?' I answered: 'I think I can.'\r\nUpon which he told me to go at once, and ordered the officer belonging\r\nto the brigade to accompany me. I then asked the General whether he\r\nwished me to retire with Hale's party or return to him. He replied:\r\n'Return to me here, that I may be sure the order has been received.'\r\n\r\nI rode off with my companion, and soon found I had undertaken to\r\nperform a far from easy, and rather hazardous, duty. I had only been\r\nover the ground twice--going to and returning from the position on the\r\n18th--and most of the villages then standing had since been burnt.\r\nThere was no road, but any number of paths, which seemed to lead in\r\nevery direction but the right one; at last, however, we arrived at our\r\ndestination, I delivered the order to Colonel Hale, and set out on\r\nmy return journey alone. My consternation was great on reaching the\r\nSikandarbagh, where I had been ordered to report myself to Mansfield,\r\nto find it deserted by the Generals, their staffs, and the troops; not\r\na creature was to be seen. I then began to understand what a long time\r\nit had taken me to carry out the errand upon which I had been sent,\r\nmuch longer, no doubt, than Mansfield thought possible. I could not\r\nhelp feeling that I was not in at all a pleasant position, for any\r\nmoment the enemy might discover the force had departed, and come out\r\nin pursuit. As it turned out, however, happily for me, they remained\r\nfor some hours in blissful ignorance of our successful retirement,\r\nand, instead of following in our wake, continued to keep up a heavy\r\nfire on the empty Residency and other abandoned posts. Turning my\r\nhorse's head in the direction I knew the troops must have taken, I\r\ngalloped as fast as he could carry me until I overtook the rear guard\r\njust as it was crossing the canal, along the right bank of which the\r\ngreater part of the force had been placed in position. When I reported\r\nmyself to Mansfield, he confessed that he had forgotten all about me,\r\nwhich somewhat surprised me, for I had frequently noticed how exactly\r\nhe remembered the particulars of any order he gave, no matter how long\r\na time it took to execute it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Colonel Napier was Chief of the Staff to Sir James\r\nOutram.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Now Lieutenant-General McLeod Innes, V.C.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Calcutta Review_, 1843. After commenting on the habitual\r\ncarelessness of Government and its disregard of ordinary military\r\nprecautions and preparations, Henry Lawrence had shown how possible it\r\nwas that a hostile party might seize Delhi, and, if the outbreak were\r\nnot speedily suppressed, what grave consequences might ensue. 'Let\r\nthis happen,' he said, 'on June 2, and does any sane man doubt that\r\ntwenty-four hours would swell the hundreds of rebels into thousands,\r\nand in a week every ploughshare in the Delhi States would be turned\r\ninto a sword? And when a sufficient force had been mustered, which\r\ncould not be effected within a month, should we not then have a more\r\ndifficult game to play than Clive at Plassy or Wellington at Assaye?\r\nWe should then be literally striking for our existence at the\r\nmost inclement season of the year, with the prestige of our name\r\ntarnished.' Going on to suggest that Meerut, Umballa, and Agra might\r\nsay that they had no troops to spare from their own necessities, or\r\nthat they had no carriage, 'Should we not, then,' he wrote, 'have to\r\nstrike anew for our Indian Empire?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Prestige, or, rather, good luck.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: 'Life of Sir Henry Lawrence.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: In Sir Henry Lawrence's 'Life' two memoranda appear,\r\none by Lieutenant (now Lieutenant-General) McLeod Innes, Assistant\r\nEngineer at Lucknow in 1857, the other by Sir Henry Lawrence himself.\r\nThey are worthy of perusal, and will give the reader some insight into\r\nLawrence's character; they will also exemplify how necessary it is\r\nfor anyone placed in a position of authority in India to study the\r\npeculiarities of the people and gain their confidence by kindness and\r\nsympathy, to which they readily respond, and, above all, to be firm\r\nand decided in his dealings with them. Firmness and decision are\r\nqualities which are appreciated more than all others by Natives; they\r\nexpect them in their Rulers, and without them no European can have any\r\npower over them, or ever hope to gain their respect and esteem.\r\n\r\n(See Appendix II).]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n1857\r\n\r\n  Death of General Havelock--Appeals from Cawnpore\r\n  --General Windham--The passage of the Ganges\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Relief of the Lucknow garrison was now accomplished--a grand\r\nachievement indeed, of which any Commander might well be proud,\r\ncarried out as it had been in every particular as originally planned,\r\nthus demonstrating with what care each detail had been thought out,\r\nand how admirably movement after movement had been executed.\r\n\r\nNovember the 23rd was spent in arranging for the march to Cawnpore,\r\nand in organizing the division which was to be left in position, under\r\nOutram, in and about the Alambagh; it was to be strong enough to hold\r\nits own, and to keep open communication with Head-Quarters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN TO ILLUSTRATE THE RELIEF OF LUCKNOW, IN 1857]\r\n\r\nMy time was chiefly occupied in assisting in the distribution of\r\ntransport, and in carrying out Hope Grant's directions as to the order\r\nin which the troops were to march. Round the Dilkusha the scene of\r\nconfusion was bewildering in the extreme; women, children, sick\r\nand wounded men, elephants, camels, bullocks and bullock-carts,\r\ngrass-cutters' ponies, and doolies with their innumerable bearers, all\r\ncrowded together. To marshal these incongruous elements and get them\r\nstarted seemed at first to be an almost hopeless task. At last the\r\nfamilies were got off in two bodies, each under a married officer\r\nwhose wife was of the party, and through whom all possible\r\narrangements for their comfort were to be made, and their place on the\r\nline of march, position in camp, etc., determined.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the force was gratified by the issue of a General\r\nOrder by the Commander-in-Chief thanking the troops for the manner in\r\nwhich the very difficult and harassing service of the Relief had been\r\nperformed. Alluding to the withdrawal, he said it was a model of\r\ndiscipline and exactitude, the result of which was that the rebels\r\nwere completely thrown off their guard, and the retirement had been\r\nsuccessfully carried out in the face of 50,000 of the enemy along a\r\nmost inconveniently narrow and tortuous lane--the only line of retreat\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nThe following morning Hope Grant's division marched to the Alambagh.\r\nOn arrival there, our transport was sent back for Outram's division,\r\nwhich joined us the morning after, bringing with it General Havelock's\r\ndead body. He had died the previous day--'a martyr to duty,' as the\r\nCommander-in-Chief expressed it in his General Order. The brave old\r\nsoldier, who had served with distinction in four campaigns before the\r\nMutiny--Burma, Afghanistan, Gwalior, and the Sutlej--was buried inside\r\nthe Alambagh enclosure, respected and honoured by the whole army, but\r\nmore especially by those who had shared in his noble efforts to rescue\r\nthe Lucknow garrison.\r\n\r\nA wash and change of clothes, in which we were now able to indulge,\r\nwere much-appreciated luxuries. From the time we had left the Alambagh\r\nevery officer and man had been on duty without cessation, and slept,\r\nif they slept at all, on the spot where the close of day found them\r\nfighting.\r\n\r\nIt was a rough experience, but, notwithstanding the exposure, hard\r\nwork, and a minimum of sleep, there was no great sickness amongst the\r\ntroops. The personal interest which every man in the force felt in\r\nthe rescue of his countrymen and countrywomen, in addition to the\r\nexcitement at all times inseparable from war, was a stimulant\r\nwhich enabled all ranks to bear up in a marvellous manner against\r\nlong-continued privations and hardships--for body and mind are equally\r\naffected by will--and there was no doubt about the will in this\r\ninstance to endure anything that was necessary for the speedy\r\nachievement of the object in view. Personally, I was in the best\r\nof health, and though I almost lived on horseback, I never felt\r\ninconvenience or fatigue.\r\n\r\nThe 25th and 26th were busy days, spent in allotting camp equipage\r\nand making the necessary arrangements for fitting out Outram's\r\nforce--4,000 strong, with 25 guns and howitzers and 10 mortars.\r\n\r\nAt 11 a.m. on the 27th we started on our return march towards\r\nCawnpore.[1] It was a strange procession. Everything in the shape of\r\nwheeled carriage and laden animals had to keep to the road, which was\r\nnarrow, and for the greater part of the way raised, for the country\r\nat that time of the year was partly under water, and _jhils_ were\r\nnumerous. Thus, the column was about twelve miles in length, so that\r\nthe head had almost reached the end of the march before the rear could\r\nstart. Delays were constant and unavoidable, and the time each day's\r\njourney occupied, as well as the mode of conveyance--country carts\r\ninnocent of springs--must have been most trying to delicate women and\r\nwounded men. Fortunately there was no rain; but the sun was still hot\r\nin the daytime, causing greater sensitiveness to the bitter cold at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nMy place was with the advance guard, as I had to go on ahead to mark\r\nout the camp and have ramps got ready to enable the carts to be taken\r\noff the raised roads. Soon after leaving the Alambagh we heard the\r\nsound of guns from the direction of Cawnpore, and when we reached\r\nBani bridge (about thirteen miles on, where a small post had been\r\nestablished) the officer in command told us that there had been heavy\r\nfiring all that day and the day before.\r\n\r\nCamp was pitched about two miles further on late in the afternoon; but\r\nmy work was not over till midnight, when the rear guard arrived, for\r\nit took all that time to form up the miscellaneous convoy.\r\n\r\nNext morning we made an early start, in order to reach our\r\ndestination, if possible, before dark. Having received no information\r\nfrom Cawnpore for more than ten days, the Commander-in-Chief was\r\nbeginning to feel extremely anxious, and the firing we had heard the\r\nprevious day had greatly increased his uneasiness, for there seemed\r\nlittle room for doubt that the Gwalior rebels were making an attack on\r\nthat place. The probability that this would happen had been foreseen\r\nby Sir Colin, and was one of his reasons for determining to limit the\r\noperations at Lucknow to the withdrawal of the garrison.\r\n\r\nWe had not proceeded far, when firing was again heard, and by noon\r\nall doubt as to its meaning was ended by a Native who brought a note\r\nmarked 'Most urgent,' written in Greek character, and addressed to\r\n'General Sir Colin Campbell, or any officer commanding troops on the\r\nLucknow road.' This turned out to be a communication from General\r\nWindham, who had been placed in command at Cawnpore when the\r\nCommander-in-Chief left for Lucknow on the 9th of November. It was\r\ndated two days earlier, and told of an attack having been made, that\r\nthere had been hard fighting, and that the troops were sorely pressed;\r\nin conclusion Windham earnestly besought the Chief to come to his\r\nassistance with the least possible delay.\r\n\r\nTwo other letters followed in quick succession, the last containing\r\nthe disappointing and disheartening intelligence that Windham, with\r\nthe greater part of his troops, had been driven into the entrenchment,\r\nplainly showing that the city and cantonment were in the possession\r\nof the enemy, and suggesting the possibility of the bridge of boats\r\nhaving been destroyed.\r\n\r\nSir Colin, becoming impatient to learn the exact state of the case,\r\ndesired me to ride on as fast as I could to the river; and if I\r\nfound the bridge broken, to return at once, but if it were still in\r\nexistence to cross over, try and see the General, and bring back all\r\nthe information I could obtain.\r\n\r\nI took a couple of sowars with me, and on reaching the river I found,\r\nunder cover of a hastily-constructed _tête-de-pont_, a guard of\r\nBritish soldiers, under Lieutenant Budgen, of the 82nd Foot, whose\r\ndelight at seeing me was most effusively expressed. He informed me\r\nthat the bridge was still intact, but that it was unlikely it would\r\nlong remain so, for Windham was surrounded except on the river side,\r\nand the garrison was 'at its last gasp.'\r\n\r\nI pushed across and got into the entrenchment, which was situated on\r\nthe river immediately below the bridge of boats. The confusion inside\r\nwas great, and I could hardly force my way through the mass of men who\r\nthronged round my horse, eager to learn when help might be expected;\r\nthey were evidently demoralized by the ill-success which had attended\r\nthe previous days' operations, and it was not until I reassured them\r\nwith the news that the Commander-in-Chief was close at hand that\r\nI managed to get through the crowd and deliver my message to the\r\nGeneral.\r\n\r\nThe 'hero of the Redan,' whom I now saw for the first time, though the\r\nfame of his achievement had preceded him to India, was a handsome,\r\ncheery-looking man of about forty-eight years of age, who appeared, in\r\ncontrast to the excited multitude I had passed, thoroughly calm and\r\ncollected; and notwithstanding the bitter disappointment it must have\r\nbeen to him to be obliged to give up the city and retire with his\r\nwholly inadequate force into the entrenchment, he was not dispirited,\r\nand had all his wits about him. In a few words he told me what had\r\nhappened, and desired me to explain to the Commander-in-Chief that,\r\nalthough the city and cantonment had to be abandoned, he was still\r\nholding the enemy in check round the assembly-rooms (which were\r\nsituated outside and to the west front of the entrenchment), thus\r\npreventing their approaching the bridge of boats near enough to injure\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI was about to start back to Head-Quarters, when suddenly loud cheers\r\nbroke from the men, caused by the appearance in their midst of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief himself. After I had left him, Sir Colin became\r\nevery minute more impatient and fidgety, and ere long started off\r\nafter me, accompanied by Mansfield and some other staff officers. He\r\nwas recognized by the soldiers, some of whom had known him in\r\nthe Crimea, and they at once surrounded him, giving enthusiastic\r\nexpression to their joy at seeing him again.\r\n\r\nThe Chief could now judge for himself as to how matters stood, so, as\r\nthere was plenty of work in camp for me, I started back to rejoin my\r\nown General. On my way I stopped to speak to Budgen, whom I found in\r\na most dejected frame of mind. Unfortunately for him, he had used\r\nexactly the same words in describing the situation at Cawnpore to Sir\r\nColin as he had to me, which roused the old Chief's indignation, and\r\nhe flew at the wretched man as he was sometimes apt to do when greatly\r\nput out, rating him soundly, and asking him how he dared to say of Her\r\nMajesty's troops that they were 'at their last gasp.'\r\n\r\nI found Hope Grant about four miles from the river bank, where the\r\ncamp was being pitched. Sir Colin did not return till after dark, when\r\nwe were told that the rest of Windham's troops had been driven inside\r\nthe entrenchment, which only confirmed what we had suspected, for\r\nflames were seen mounting high into the air from the direction of the\r\nassembly-rooms, which, it now turned out, had been set on fire by the\r\nenemy--an unfortunate occurrence, as in them had been stored the camp\r\nequipage, kits, clothing, etc., belonging to most of the regiments\r\nwhich had crossed the Ganges into Oudh. But what was more serious\r\nstill was the fact that the road was now open for the rebels' heavy\r\nguns, which might be brought to bear upon the bridge of boats at any\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nOwing to the length of the march (thirty-two or thirty-three miles),\r\nsome of the carts and the heavy guns did not arrive till daybreak.\r\nScarcely had the bullocks been unyoked, before the guns were ordered\r\non to the river bank, where they formed up, and so effectually plied\r\nthe enemy with shot and shell that the passage of the river was\r\nrendered comparatively safe for our troops.\r\n\r\nWhen the men had breakfasted, the order was given to cross over. Sir\r\nColin accompanied the column as far as the bridge, and then directed\r\nHope Grant, with the Horse Artillery and most of the Cavalry,\r\nBourchier's battery and Adrian Hope's brigade, to move to the\r\nsouth-east of the city and take up a position on the open ground which\r\nstretched from the river to the Grand Trunk Road, with the canal\r\nbetween us and the enemy. By this arrangement communication with\r\nAllahabad, which had been temporarily interrupted, was restored,\r\na very necessary measure, for until the road was made safe,\r\nreinforcements, which on account of the paucity of transport had to\r\nbe sent up in small detachments, could not reach us, nor could the\r\nfamilies and sick soldiers be sent down country.\r\n\r\nThe passage of the huge convoy over the bridge of boats, under the\r\nprotection of Greathed's brigade, was a most tedious business,\r\noccupying thirty hours, from 3 p.m. on the 29th till about 9 p.m. on\r\nthe 30th, when Inglis brought over the rear guard. During its transit\r\nthe enemy fired occasionally on the bridge, and tried to destroy it by\r\nfloating fire-rafts down the river; fortunately they did not succeed,\r\nand the convoy arrived without accident on the ground set apart for it\r\nin the rear of our camp.\r\n\r\nFor the three first days of December I was chiefly employed in\r\nreconnoitring with the Native Cavalry the country to our left and\r\nrear, to make sure that the rebels had no intention of attempting to\r\nget round that flank, and in making arrangements for the despatch of\r\nthe families, the sick, and the wounded, to Allahabad _en route_ to\r\nCalcutta. We improvised covers for some of the carts, in which we\r\nplaced the women and children and the worst cases amongst the men; but\r\nwith all our efforts to render them less unfit for the purpose, these\r\ncarts remained but rough and painful conveyances for delicate women\r\nand suffering men to travel in.\r\n\r\nWe were not left altogether unmolested by the enemy during these days.\r\nRound shot kept continually falling in our midst, particularly in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Commander-in-Chief's tent, the exact position of\r\nwhich must have somehow been made known to the rebels, otherwise they\r\ncould not have distinguished it from the rest of the camp, as it\r\nwas an unpretentious hill tent, such as was then used by subaltern\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nUntil the women left camp on the night of the 3rd December, we were\r\nobliged to act on the defensive, and were not able to stop the enemy's\r\nfire completely, though we managed to keep it under control by\r\noccupying the point called Generalganj, and strengthening the piquets\r\non our right and left flank. On the 4th a second unsuccessful attempt\r\nwas made to destroy the bridge of boats by means of fire-rafts, and on\r\nthe 5th there were several affairs at the outposts, all of which ended\r\nin the discomfiture of the rebels without any great loss to ourselves;\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Ewart of the 93rd Highlanders, who lost his arm on\r\nthe 1st, and Captain Crutchley of the same regiment, who was severely\r\nwounded, being the only casualties amongst the officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Our force consisted of the troops which Sir Colin had\r\nreviewed on the Alambagh plain on the 11th instant, with the exception\r\nof the 75th Foot, which was transferred to Outram's division. We had,\r\nhowever, in their place, the survivors of the 32nd Foot, and of the\r\nNative regiments who had behaved so loyally during the siege. These\r\nlatter were formed into one battalion, called the Regiment of\r\nLucknow--the present 16th Bengal Infantry. The 32nd Foot, which was\r\nnot up to full strength (1,067) when the Mutiny broke out, had in\r\n1857-58 no less than 610 men killed and wounded, exclusive of 169\r\nwho died from disease. We had also with us, and to them was given an\r\nhonoured place, 'the remnant of the few faithful pensioners who had\r\nalone, of many thousands in Oudh, responded to the call of Sir Henry\r\nLawrence to come in to aid the cause of those whose salt they had\r\neaten.'--Lecture on the Relief of Lucknow, by Colonel H.W. Norman.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n1857\r\n\r\n  The fight at Cawnpore--Unexpected visitors--A long chase\r\n  --Unjur Tiwari--Bithur--Windham at Cawnpore\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time had now arrived to give the Gwalior troops a repetition of\r\nthe lesson taught them at Agra on the 10th October. They had had\r\nit all their own way since then; and having proved too strong for\r\nWindham, they misunderstood the Commander-in-Chief remaining for so\r\nlong on the defensive, and attributed his inaction to fear of their\r\nsuperior prowess.\r\n\r\nSunday, the 6th December, was one of those glorious days in which the\r\nEuropean in northern India revels for a great part of the winter,\r\nclear and cool, with a cloudless sky. I awoke refreshed after a good\r\nnight's rest, and in high spirits at the prospect before us of\r\na satisfactory day's work; for we hoped to drive the enemy from\r\nCawnpore, and to convince those who had witnessed, if not taken part\r\nin, the horrible brutalities perpetrated there, that England's hour\r\nhad come at last.\r\n\r\nThe 42nd Highlanders, a battery of Royal Artillery, and detachments of\r\nseveral different corps, had quite lately been added to the force,\r\nso that the Commander-in-Chief had now at his disposal about 5,000\r\nInfantry, 600 Cavalry, and 35 guns. The Infantry were divided into\r\nfour brigades, commanded respectively by Greathed, Adrian Hope,\r\nInglis, and Walpole.[1] The Cavalry brigade, consisting of the\r\nsame regiments which had come with us from Delhi, was commanded by\r\nBrigadier Little, the Artillery[2] by Major-General Dupuis, and the\r\nEngineers by Colonel Harness, General Windham being placed in charge\r\nof the entrenchments.\r\n\r\nOpposed to this force there were 25,000 men, with 40 guns, not\r\nall disciplined soldiers, but all adepts in the use of arms, and\r\naccustomed to fighting. They were divided into two distinct bodies,\r\none composed of the Gwalior Contingent, the Rani of Jhansi's\r\nfollowers, and the mutinous regiments which had been stationed in\r\nBundelkand, Central India, and Rajputana, which occupied the right\r\nof the enemy's position, covering their line of retreat by the Kalpi\r\nroad. The other consisted of the troops--regular and irregular--which\r\nhad attached themselves to the Nana, and held the city and the ground\r\nwhich lay between it and the Ganges, their line of retreat being along\r\nthe Grand Trunk Road to Bithur. Tantia Topi was in command of the\r\nwhole force, while the Nana remained with his own people on the left\r\nflank.\r\n\r\nOn the centre and left the enemy were very strongly posted, and could\r\nonly be approached through the city and by way of the difficult broken\r\nground, covered with ruined houses, stretching along the river bank.\r\n\r\nWhile the men were eating their breakfasts, and the tents were being\r\nstruck, packed, and sent to the rear, Sir Colin carefully explained\r\nhis plan of operations to the Commanding officers and the staff; this\r\nplan was, to make a feint on the enemy's left and centre, but to\r\ndirect the real attack on their right, hoping thus to be able to\r\ndispose of this portion of Tantia Topi's force, before assistance\r\ncould be obtained from any other part of the line.\r\n\r\nWith this view Windham was ordered to open with every gun within\r\nthe entrenchment at 9 a.m.; while Greathed, supported by Walpole,\r\nthreatened the enemy's centre. Exactly at the hour named, the roar of\r\nWindham's Artillery was heard, followed a few minutes later by the\r\nrattle of Greathed's musketry along the bank of the canal. Meanwhile,\r\nAdrian Hope's brigade was drawn up in fighting formation behind the\r\nCavalry stables on our side of the Trunk Road, and Inglis's brigade\r\nbehind the racecourse on the other side. At eleven o'clock the order\r\nwas given to advance. The Cavalry and Horse Artillery moved to the\r\nleft with instructions to cross the canal by a bridge about two miles\r\noff, and to be ready to fall upon the enemy as they retreated along\r\nthe Kalpi road. Walpole's brigade, covered by Smith's Field battery,\r\ncrossed the canal by a bridge immediately to the left of Generalganj,\r\ncleared the canal bank, and, by hugging the wall of the city,\r\neffectually prevented reinforcements reaching the enemy's right.\r\n\r\nPeel's and Longden's heavy guns, and Bourchier's and Middleton's Field\r\nbatteries, now opened on some brick-kilns and mounds which the enemy\r\nwere holding in strength on our side of the canal, and against which\r\nAdrian Hope's and Inglis's brigades advanced in parallel lines,\r\ncovered by the 4th Punjab Infantry in skirmishing order.\r\n\r\nIt was a sight to be remembered, that advance, as we watched it from\r\nour position on horseback, grouped round the Commander-in-Chief.\r\nBefore us stretched a fine open grassy plain; to the right the dark\r\ngreen of the Rifle Brigade battalions revealed where Walpole's brigade\r\nwas crossing the canal. Nearer to us, the 53rd Foot, and the 42nd and\r\n93rd Highlanders in their bonnets and kilts, marched as on parade,\r\nalthough the enemy's guns played upon them and every now and then a\r\nround shot plunged through their ranks or ricocheted over their heads;\r\non they went without apparently being in the least disconcerted, and\r\nwithout the slightest confusion.\r\n\r\nAs the brick-kilns were neared, the 4th Punjab Infantry, supported by\r\nthe 53rd Foot, charged the enemy in grand style, and drove them across\r\nthe canal. Here there occurred a slight check. The rebels, having been\r\nreinforced, made a stand, and bringing guns to bear upon the bridge\r\nwithin grape range, they must have done us great damage but for the\r\ntimely arrival of Peel and his sailors with a heavy gun. This put new\r\nlife into the attacking party; with a loud cheer they dashed across\r\nthe bridge, while Peel poured round after round from his 24-pounder on\r\nthe insurgents with most salutary effect. The enemy faced about and\r\nretired with the utmost celerity, leaving a 9-pounder gun in our\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nThe whole of Hope's brigade, followed by Inglis's, now arrived on the\r\nscene and proceeded to cross the canal, some by the bridge, while\r\nothers waded through the water. Having got to the other side, both\r\nbrigades re-formed, and moved rapidly along the Kalpi road. We\r\n(the Commander-in-Chief, Hope Grant, and their respective staffs)\r\naccompanied this body of troops for about a mile and a half, when the\r\nrebels' camp came in sight. A few rounds were fired into it, and then\r\nit was rushed.\r\n\r\nWe were evidently unexpected visitors; wounded men were lying about in\r\nall directions, and many sepoys were surprised calmly cooking their\r\nfrugal meal of unleavened bread. The tents were found to be full of\r\nproperty plundered from the city and cantonment of Cawnpore--soldiers'\r\nkits, bedding, clothing, and every description of miscellaneous\r\narticles; but to us the most valuable acquisition was a quantity of\r\ngrain and a large number of fine bullocks, of which those best suited\r\nfor Ordnance purposes were kept, and the rest were made over to the\r\nCommissariat.\r\n\r\nThat portion of the rebel force with which we had been engaged was now\r\nin full retreat, and Sir Colin wished to follow it up at once; but\r\nthe Cavalry and Horse Artillery had not arrived, so that considerable\r\ndelay occurred; while we were waiting the Chief arranged to send\r\nMansfield with a small force[3] round to the north of Cawnpore, and,\r\nby thus threatening the road along which the Nana's troops must\r\nretreat, compel them to evacuate the city. The 23rd Royal Welsh\r\nFusiliers and a detachment of the 38th Foot were to be left to look\r\nafter the deserted camp, and Inglis's brigade was to move along the\r\nKalpi road in support of the Cavalry and Horse Artillery. But where\r\nwere the much-needed and anxiously-expected mounted troops? It was not\r\nlike them to be out of the way when their services were required; but\r\nit was now nearly two o'clock, they had not appeared, and the days\r\nwere very short. What was to be done? The enemy could not be allowed\r\nto carry off their guns and escape punishment. Suddenly the old Chief\r\nannounced that he had determined to follow them up himself with\r\nBourchier's battery and his own escort.\r\n\r\nWhat a chase we had! We went at a gallop, only pulling up occasionally\r\nfor the battery to come into action, 'to clear our front and flanks.'\r\nWe came up with a goodly number of stragglers, and captured several\r\nguns and carts laden with ammunition. But we were by this time\r\novertaking large bodies of the rebels, and they were becoming too\r\nnumerous for a single battery and a few staff officers to cope with.\r\nWe had outstripped the Commander-in-Chief, and Hope Grant decided to\r\nhalt, hoping that the missing Cavalry and Horse Artillery might soon\r\nturn up. We had not to wait long. In about a quarter of an hour they\r\nappeared among some trees to our left, even more put out than we were\r\nat their not having been to the front at such a time. Their guide had\r\nmade too great a détour, but the sound of our guns showed them his\r\nmistake, and they at once altered their course and pushed on in the\r\ndirection of the firing. Sir Colin had also come up, so off we started\r\nagain, and never drew rein until we reached the Pandu Naddi, fourteen\r\nmiles from Cawnpore. The rout was complete. Finding themselves\r\npressed, the sepoys scattered over the country, throwing away their\r\narms and divesting themselves of their uniform, that they might pass\r\nfor harmless peasants. Nineteen guns, some of them of large calibre,\r\nwere left in our hands. Our victory was particularly satisfactory in\r\nthat it was achieved with but slight loss to ourselves, the casualties\r\nbeing 2 officers and 11 men killed, and 9 officers and 76 men wounded.\r\n\r\nHope Grant now desired me to hurry back to Cawnpore before it got too\r\ndark, and select the ground for the night's bivouac. As there was some\r\nrisk in going alone, Augustus Anson volunteered to accompany me.\r\nWe had got about half-way, when we came across the dead body of\r\nLieutenant Salmond, who had been acting Aide-de-camp to my General,\r\nand must have got separated from us in the pursuit. His throat was\r\ncut, and he had a severe wound on the face. Soon after we met Inglis's\r\nbrigade, which, in accordance with my instructions, I turned back. On\r\nreaching the Gwalior Contingent camp, we heard that an attempt had\r\nbeen made to recapture it, which had been repulsed by the troops left\r\nin charge.\r\n\r\nIt was dusk by the time we reached the junction of the Kalpi and Grand\r\nTrunk roads, and we agreed that this would be a good place for a\r\nbivouac, the city being about a mile in front, and Mansfield's column\r\nless than two miles to the left. I marked out the ground, and showed\r\neach corps as it came up the position it was to occupy. When all this\r\nwas over I was pretty well tired out and ravenously hungry; but food\r\nthere was none, so I had made up my mind to lie down, famished as I\r\nwas. Just then I came across some sleeping men, who to my joy turned\r\nout to be Dighton Probyn and the officers of the 2nd Punjab Cavalry,\r\nwho were magnanimous enough to forgive the abrupt interruption to\r\ntheir slumbers, and to supply me with some cold mutton, bread, and a\r\nbottle of beer. Never was man more grateful for a meal, and never was\r\na meal more thoroughly enjoyed. I lay down beside my friends and was\r\nsoon fast asleep, in spite of the bitter cold and being much troubled\r\nabout my horse; neither for him nor myself was there a vestige of\r\ncovering to be found.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I was astir by cockcrow. Patrols who had been sent\r\nforward to ascertain the truth of a rumour which had reached the\r\nCommander-in-Chief the previous evening, to the effect that the city\r\nhad been evacuated, returned with confirmation of the report; but the\r\nnews in other respects was far from satisfactory. Mansfield's movement\r\nhad caused the enemy to retire, but they had got away without loss,\r\nand had succeeded in carrying off all their guns; so that only one\r\nhalf of Tantia Topi's force had really been dealt with; the other\r\nhalf still remained to be disposed of, and to Hope Grant's great\r\nsatisfaction and my delight, the duty of following them up was\r\nentrusted to him.\r\n\r\nHis orders were to go to Bithur, as it was thought likely that the\r\nNana's troops would retire on that place. But as the news was not\r\nvery reliable, Hope Grant was told to use his own discretion, and act\r\naccording to circumstances.\r\n\r\nFor several days I had been trying unsuccessfully to get hold of some\r\nNatives upon whom I could rely to bring me trustworthy information as\r\nto the enemy's movements. It is always of the utmost importance that a\r\nQuartermaster-General on service should have the help of such men, and\r\nI was now more than ever in need of reliable intelligence. In this\r\nemergency I applied to Captain Bruce, the officer in charge of the\r\nIntelligence Department which had been established at Cawnpore for the\r\npurpose of tracing the whereabouts of those rebels who had taken\r\na prominent part in the atrocities. I was at once supplied with a\r\nfirst-rate man, Unjur Tiwari by name,[4] who from that moment until\r\nI left India for England in April, 1858, rendered me most valuable\r\nservice. He was a Brahmin by caste, and belonged to the 1st Native\r\nInfantry. In a few words I explained what I required of him, and he\r\nstarted at once for Bithur, promising to meet me the next day on the\r\nline of march.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF CAWNPORE. 1857.]\r\n\r\nEarly on the afternoon of the 8th we marched out of Cawnpore, and at\r\nsunset Unjur Tiwari, true to his promise, made his appearance at the\r\npoint where the road turns off to Bithur. He told me that the Nana had\r\nslept at that place the night before, but hearing of our approach, had\r\ndecamped with all his guns and most of his followers, and was now at a\r\nferry some miles up the river, trying to get across and make his way\r\nto Oudh. We had come thirteen miles, and had as many more to go before\r\nwe could get to the ferry, and as there was nothing to be gained\r\nby arriving there in the dark, a halt was ordered for rest and\r\nrefreshment. At midnight we started again, and reached Sheorajpur\r\n(three miles from the ferry) at daybreak. Here we left our\r\nimpedimenta, and proceeded by a cross-country road. Presently a couple\r\nof mounted men belonging to the enemy, not perceiving who we were,\r\ngalloped straight into the escort. On discovering their mistake, they\r\nturned and tried to escape, but in vain; one was killed, the other\r\ncaptured, and from him we learnt that the rebels were only a short\r\ndistance ahead. We pushed on, and soon came in sight of them and of\r\nthe river; crowds were collected on the banks, and boats were being\r\nhurriedly laden, some of the guns having already been placed on board.\r\nOur troops were ordered to advance, but the ground along the river\r\nbank was treacherous and very heavy. Notwithstanding, the Artillery\r\nmanaged to struggle through, and when the batteries had got to within\r\n1,000 yards of the ferry, the enemy appeared suddenly to discover\r\nour presence, and opened upon us with their Artillery. Our batteries\r\ngalloped on, and got considerably nearer before they returned the\r\nfire; after a few rounds the rebels broke and fled. The ground was so\r\nunfavourable for pursuit, being full of holes and quicksands, that\r\nnearly all escaped, except a few cut up by the Cavalry. Fifteen guns\r\nwere captured, with one single casualty on our side--the General\r\nhimself--who was hit on the foot by a spent grape-shot, without,\r\nhappily, being much hurt.\r\n\r\nHope Grant's successful management of this little expedition\r\nconsiderably enhanced the high opinion the Commander-in-Chief had\r\nalready formed of his ability. He was next ordered to proceed to\r\nBithur and complete the destruction of that place, which had been\r\nbegun by Havelock in July. We found the palace in good order--there\r\nwas little evidence that it had been visited by an avenging force, and\r\nin one of the rooms which had been occupied by the treacherous Azimula\r\nKhan, I came across a number of letters, some unopened, and some\r\nextremely interesting, to which I shall have to refer later on.\r\n\r\nWe left Adrian Hope's brigade at Bithur to search for treasure\r\nreported to have been buried near the palace, and returned to\r\nCawnpore, where we remained for about ten days, not at all sorry for\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nDuring this time of comparative idleness, I went over the ground where\r\nthe troops under Windham had been engaged for three days, and heard\r\nmany comments on the conduct of the operations. All spoke in high\r\nterms of Windham's dash and courage, but as a Commander he was\r\ngenerally considered to have failed.\r\n\r\nWindham was without doubt placed in an extremely difficult position.\r\nThe relief of the garrison at Lucknow was of such paramount importance\r\nthat Sir Colin Campbell was obliged to take with him every available\r\nman,[5] and found it necessary to order Windham to send all\r\nreinforcements after him as soon as they arrived, although it was\r\nrecognized as probable that Tantia Topi, with the large force then\r\nassembled near Kalpi, would advance on Cawnpore as soon as the\r\nCommander-in-Chief was committed to his difficult undertaking.\r\nWindham's orders were to improve the defences of the entrenchment; to\r\ncarefully watch the movements of the Gwalior army; and to make as much\r\ndisplay as possible of the troops at his command by encamping them in\r\na conspicuous position outside the city; but he was not on any account\r\nto move out to attack, unless compelled to do so in order to prevent\r\nthe bombardment of the entrenchment. The safety of this entrenchment\r\nwas of great importance, for it contained a number of guns, quantities\r\nof ammunition and other warlike stores, and it covered, as already\r\nshown, the bridge of boats over the Ganges.\r\n\r\nWindham loyally carried out his instructions, but he subsequently\r\nasked for and obtained leave to detain any troops arriving at Cawnpore\r\nafter the 14th of November, as he did not feel himself strong enough,\r\nwith the force at his disposal, to resist the enemy if attacked. But\r\neven after having received this sanction he twice despatched strong\r\nreinforcements to Lucknow, thus weakening himself considerably in\r\norder to give Sir Colin all possible help.\r\n\r\nWindham eventually had at his disposal about 1,700 Infantry and eight\r\nguns, the greater part of which were encamped as directed, outside the\r\ncity, close to the junction of the Delhi and Kalpi roads, while the\r\nrest were posted in and around the entrenchment. Meanwhile the rebels\r\nwere slowly approaching Cawnpore in detachments, with the evident\r\nintention of surrounding the place. On the 17th two bodies of troops\r\nwere pushed on to Shuli and Shirajpur, within fifteen miles of the\r\ncity, and a little less than that distance from each other. Windham\r\nthought that if he could manage to surprise either of these, he could\r\nprevent the enemy from concentrating, and he drew up a scheme for\r\ngiving effect to this plan, which he submitted for the approval of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief. No reply came, and after waiting a week he gave up\r\nall idea of attempting to surprise the detachments, and determined to\r\ntry and arrest the rebels' advance by attacking the main body, still\r\nsome distance off. Accordingly he broke up his camp, and marched six\r\nmiles along the Kalpi road, on the same day that the Gwalior force\r\nmoved some distance nearer to Cawnpore. The next morning, the 25th,\r\nthe enemy advanced to Pandu Naddi, within three miles of Windham's\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\nWindham now found himself in a very critical position. With only 1,200\r\nInfantry[6] and eight light guns, he was opposed to Tantia Topi with\r\nan army of 25,000 men and forty guns. He had to choose whether he\r\nwould fight these enormous odds or retire: he decided that to fight\r\nwas the least of the two evils, and he was so far successful that\r\nhe drove back that portion of the opposing force immediately in\r\nhis front, and captured three guns; but being unable to press his\r\nadvantage on account of the paucity of men and the total absence of\r\nCavalry, he had perforce to fall back--a grievous necessity. He was\r\nfollowed the whole way, insulted and jeered at, by the rebel horsemen.\r\nThe result of the day was to give confidence to the wily Mahratta\r\nleader; he pushed on to Cawnpore, and attacked Windham with such\r\nvehemence that by nightfall on the 28th the British troops were driven\r\ninside the entrenchment, having had 315 men killed and wounded, and\r\nhaving lost all their baggage and camp equipage.\r\n\r\nWindham undoubtedly laid himself open to censure. His defence was\r\nthat, had he received the Commander-in-Chief's authority to carry out\r\nhis plan for surprising the rebels, he would certainly have broken up\r\ntheir army, and the disaster could not have occurred. But surely when\r\nhe decided that circumstances had so changed since Sir Colin's orders\r\nwere given as to justify him in disregarding them, he should have\r\nacted on his own responsibility, and taken such steps as appeared to\r\nhim best, instead of applying for sanction to a Commander far from\r\nthe scene of action, and so entirely ignorant of the conditions under\r\nwhich the application was made, as to render it impossible for him to\r\ndecide whether such sanction should be given. The march which Windham\r\nmade towards the enemy on the 24th was quite as grave a disobedience\r\nof orders as would have been the surprise movement he contemplated\r\non the 17th; but while the former placed him in a most dangerous\r\nposition, and one from which it was impossible to deal the enemy a\r\ndecisive blow, the latter, if successful, would have deserved, and\r\ndoubtless would have received, the highest praise.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Greathed's brigade consisted of the 8th and 64th Foot and\r\n2nd Punjab Infantry.

A sepoy\r\nin the 1st Bengal Native Infantry, he was at Banda when the Mutiny\r\nbroke out, and during the disturbances at that place he aided\r\na European clerk and his wife to escape, and showed his\r\ndisinterestedness by refusing to take a gold ring, the only reward\r\nthey had to offer him. He then joined Havelock's force, and rendered\r\nexcellent service as a spy; and although taken prisoner more than\r\nonce, and on one occasion tortured, he never wavered in his loyalty to\r\nus. Accompanying Outram to Lucknow, he volunteered to carry a letter\r\nto Cawnpore, and after falling into the hands of the rebels, and\r\nbeing cruelly ill-treated by them, he effected his escape, and safely\r\ndelivered Outram's message to Sir Colin Campbell. He then worked\r\nfor me most faithfully, procuring information which I could always\r\nthoroughly rely upon; and I was much gratified when he was rewarded by\r\na grant of Rs. 3,000, presented with a sword of honour, and invested\r\nwith the Order of British India, with the title of Sirdar Bahadur. I\r\nwas proportionately distressed some years later to find that, owing to\r\nmisrepresentations of enemies when he was serving in the Oudh Military\r\nPolice, Unjur Tiwari had been deprived of his rewards, and learning he\r\nwas paralyzed and in want, I begged Lord Napier to interest himself in\r\nthe matter, the result being that the brave old man was given a yearly\r\npension of Rs. 1,200 for his life. He was alive when I left India,\r\nand although he resided some distance from the railway he always had\r\nhimself carried to see me whenever I travelled in his direction.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The garrison left at Cawnpore consisted of:\r\n\r\n  Four companies of the 64th Foot, and small\r\n  detachments of other regiments             450 men.\r\n  Sailors                                     47 men.\r\n                                             --------\r\n  Total                                      497\r\n\r\nwith a hastily organized bullock battery of four field guns, manned\r\npartly by Europeans and partly by Sikhs.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The force was composed of the 34th Foot, and portions of\r\nthe 82nd and 88th Foot, and 2nd Battalion Rifle Brigade; with four\r\n9-pounders, manned partly by Royal and Bengal gunners and partly by\r\nSikhs; and four 6-pounders, manned by Madras Native gunners.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n1857-1858\r\n\r\n  The Fight at Khudaganj--A mêlée--Oudh or Rohilkand?\r\n\r\n\r\nOur stay at Cawnpore was more prolonged than the Commander-in-Chief\r\nintended or wished it to be, but want of transport made it impossible\r\nfor us to move until the carts returned which had gone to Allahabad\r\nwith the women and children and the sick soldiers. We were thus\r\ndelayed until the 23rd December, on which date we commenced our march\r\ntowards Fatehgarh.\r\n\r\nAt Chobipur, two marches from Cawnpore, where we spent Christmas Day,\r\nwe were joined by the troops who had been left behind at Bithur;\r\nthey had not succeeded in discovering any considerable quantity of\r\ntreasure, some silver vessels of various kinds being the only result\r\nof their labours.\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief's object in moving on Fatehgarh was to restore\r\norder throughout the Doab and open communication between the Punjab\r\nand Bengal.\r\n\r\nA brigade under Brigadier Walpole had been despatched on the 16th,\r\nwith orders to clear the country along the left bank of the Jumna up\r\nto Mainpuri, where he was to be joined by Brigadier Seaton with a\r\nstrong column from Delhi, and whence the united force was to advance\r\non Fatehgarh.\r\n\r\nWe reached Gursahaiganj, where the road turns off to Fatehgarh, on the\r\n31st, and here the main body of the army halted on New Year's Day,\r\n1858; but information having been received that 5,000 rebels under the\r\nNawab of Farakabad had partly destroyed the suspension bridge over\r\nthe Kali Naddi, about five miles ahead, and had then gone off towards\r\nFatehgarh, Adrian Hope's brigade was sent forward to repair the damage\r\nand watch the bridge.\r\n\r\nEarly the following morning Sir Colin, with Mansfield and the rest of\r\nhis staff, went on to inspect progress, leaving orders for the rest of\r\nthe force to follow later in the day. Very soon, however, Hope Grant\r\nreceived an urgent message from the Chief of the Staff, telling him to\r\npush on the troops with all possible speed, as the enemy had returned,\r\nand were now in strength on the other side of the Kali Naddi.\r\n\r\nWe (Sir Hope and his staff) started off with the Horse Artillery and\r\nCavalry, and found, on reaching the bridge, that the rebels were\r\noccupying the village of Khudaganj, just across the river, and only\r\nabout 300 yards off, from which advantageous position they were\r\npouring a heavy fire on Hope's brigade. Our piquets on the further\r\nside of the stream had been strengthened by a wing of the 53rd Foot,\r\nand a wing of the 93rd Highlanders had been placed in reserve behind\r\nthe bridge on the nearer side, the rest of the regiment having been\r\ndespatched to watch a ford some distance down the river, while a\r\nbattery of Field Artillery had been brought into action in reply to\r\nthe enemy's guns. Immediately on the arrival of the main body, three\r\nof Peel's guns, under Vaughan, his First Lieutenant, were pushed\r\nacross the bridge to the further side, and getting under shelter of\r\na convenient building, opened fire on the village, and on a toll-bar\r\ndirectly in its front, about which the enemy were collected in\r\nconsiderable numbers. Our Infantry now crossed over, followed by the\r\nCavalry and Horse Artillery--a tedious operation, as there had not\r\nbeen time to fully repair the bridge, and in one place planks had only\r\nbeen laid for half its width, necessitating horses being led, and\r\nInfantry passing over in sections. Moreover, the enemy had got the\r\nexact range, and several casualties occurred at this spot; one round\r\nshot alone killed and wounded six men of the 8th Foot. Vaughan at\r\nlast succeeded in silencing the gun which had troubled us most, and\r\npreparations were made for an attack on the village. While we were\r\nwatching the proceedings, the Interpreter to the Naval Brigade, Henry\r\nHamilton Maxwell, a brother officer of mine who had been standing\r\nclose to me, was very badly wounded in the leg, and both Sir Colin and\r\nSir Hope were hit by spent bullets, luckily without being much hurt.\r\n\r\nThere was a feeling throughout the army that Sir Colin was inclined to\r\nfavour Highlanders unduly; and a rumour got about that the 93rd were\r\nto be allowed the honour of delivering the assault on Khudaganj, which\r\nwas highly resented by the 53rd, and they determined that on this\r\noccasion, at any rate, the Highlanders should not have it all their\r\nown way. The 53rd was composed of a remarkably fine set of fellows,\r\nchiefly Irish, and it was Mansfield's own regiment; wishing,\r\ntherefore, to do an old comrade a good turn, he had placed Major\r\nPayn,[1] one of the senior officers, in command of the piquets. Payn\r\nwas a fine dashing soldier, and a great favourite with the men, who\r\ncalculated on his backing them up if they upset Sir Colin's little\r\nplan. Whether what happened was with or without Payn's permission, I\r\ncannot say, but we were all waiting near the bridge for the attacking\r\nparty to form when suddenly the 'advance' was sounded, then the\r\n'double,' followed by a tremendous cheer, and we saw the 53rd charge\r\nthe enemy. Sir Colin was very angry, but the 53rd could not be brought\r\nback, and there was nothing for it but to support them. Hope's and\r\nGreathed's troops were instantly pushed on, and the Cavalry and Horse\r\nArtillery were ordered to mount.\r\n\r\nThe ground gradually sloped upwards towards Khudaganj, and the\r\nregiments moving up to the attack made a fine picture. The 93rd\r\nfollowed the impulsive 53rd, while Greathed's brigade took a line to\r\nthe left, and as they neared the village the rebels hastily limbered\r\nup their guns and retired. This was an opportunity for mounted troops\r\nsuch as does not often occur; it was instantly seized by Hope Grant,\r\nwho rode to the Cavalry, drawn up behind some sand hills, and gave the\r\nword of command, 'Threes left, trot, march.' The words had hardly left\r\nhis lips before we had started in pursuit of the enemy, by this time\r\nhalf a mile ahead, the 9th Lancers leading the way, followed by\r\nYounghusband's, Gough's, and Probyn's squadrons. When within 300 yards\r\nof the fugitives, the 'charge' was sounded, and in a few seconds we\r\nwere in their midst. A regular mêlée ensued, a number of the rebels\r\nwere killed, and seven guns captured in less than as many minutes. The\r\nGeneral now formed the Cavalry into a long line, and, placing himself\r\nat the head of his own regiment (the 9th Lancers), followed up the\r\nflying foe. I rode a little to his left with Younghusband's squadron,\r\nand next to him came Tyrrell Ross, the doctor.[2] As we galloped\r\nalong, Younghusband drew my attention with great pride to the\r\nadmirable manner in which his men kept their dressing.\r\n\r\nOn the line thundered, overtaking groups of the enemy, who every now\r\nand then turned and fired into us before they could be cut down,\r\nor knelt to receive us on their bayonets before discharging their\r\nmuskets. The chase continued for nearly five miles, until daylight\r\nbegan to fail and we appeared to have got to the end of the fugitives,\r\nwhen the order was given to wheel to the right and form up on the\r\nroad. Before, however, this movement could be carried out, we overtook\r\na batch of mutineers, who faced about and fired into the squadron at\r\nclose quarters. I saw Younghusband fall, but I could not go to his\r\nassistance, as at that moment one of his _sowars_ was in dire peril\r\nfrom a sepoy who was attacking him with his fixed bayonet, and had I\r\nnot helped the man and disposed of his opponent, he must have been\r\nkilled. The next moment I descried in the distance two sepoys making\r\noff with a standard, which I determined must be captured, so I rode\r\nafter the rebels and overtook them, and while wrenching the staff out\r\nof the hands of one of them, whom I cut down, the other put his musket\r\nclose to my body and fired; fortunately for me it missed fire, and I\r\ncarried off the standard.[3]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of the Engagement on the Banks of the KALI NADI at\r\nKHUDAGANJ January 2nd. 1858.]\r\n\r\nTyrrell Ross, attracted by a party of men in the rear of the squadron\r\nbending over the fallen Younghusband, now came up, and, to everyone's\r\ngreat grief, pronounced the wound to be mortal. From the day that I\r\nhad annexed Younghusband's pony at the siege of Delhi we had been so\r\nmuch together, and had become such fast friends, that it was a great\r\nshock to me to be told that never again would my gallant comrade lead\r\nthe men in whom he took such soldierly pride.[4]\r\n\r\nWhen the wounded had been attended to, we returned to camp, where\r\nwe found Sir Colin waiting to welcome us, and we received quite an\r\novation from our comrades in the Infantry and Artillery. We must\r\nhave presented a curious spectacle as we rode back, almost every\r\nman carrying some trophy of the day, for the enemy had abandoned\r\neverything in their flight, and we found the road strewn with laden\r\ncarts and palankins, arms, Native clothing, etc. Our losses were\r\nsurprisingly small--only 10 men killed, and 30 men and 2 officers\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nThe next day the column marched to Fatehgarh, which we found deserted.\r\nThe rebels had fled so precipitately that they had left the bridge\r\nover the Ganges intact, and had not attempted to destroy the valuable\r\ngun-carriage factory in the fort, which was then placed in the charge\r\nof Captain H. Legeyt Bruce.[5]\r\n\r\nWe remained a whole month at Fatehgarh, and loud were the complaints\r\nin camp at the unaccountable delay. It was the general opinion that\r\nwe ought to move into Rohilkand, and settle that part of the country\r\nbefore returning to Lucknow; this view was very strongly held by\r\nSir Colin Campbell, and those who accused him of \"indecision,\r\ndilatoriness, and wasting the best of the cold weather\" could not have\r\nknown how little he deserved their censure. The truth was, that the\r\nGovernor-General and the Commander-in-Chief were not in accord as to\r\nthe order in which the several military operations should be taken in\r\nhand; the latter urged that Rohilkand should be dealt with first, and\r\nsettled before the end of the cold weather; he thought that the troops\r\nwould then be the better for a rest, and that Lucknow could very well\r\nwait till the following autumn. Lord Canning opined, on the other hand\r\n(and I entirely agree with him), that, while it was most desirable\r\nthat order should be restored in Rohilkand, and indeed throughout the\r\nwhole of the North-West Provinces, the possession of Lucknow was of\r\n'far greater value.' 'Every eye,' Lord Canning wrote, 'is upon Oudh as\r\nit was upon Delhi: Oudh is not only the rallying-place of the sepoys,\r\nthe place to which they all look, and by the doings in which their own\r\nhopes and prospects rise or fall; but it represents a dynasty; there\r\nis a king of Oudh \"seeking his own.\"' He pointed out that there was an\r\nuneasy feeling amongst the Chiefs of Native States, who were intently\r\nwatching our attitude with regard to Lucknow, and that even in\r\n'far-off Burma' news from Lucknow was anxiously looked for. The\r\nGovernor-General laid great stress also upon the advisability of\r\nemploying as soon and as close to their own country as possible the\r\ntroops from Nepal which, at Sir Henry Lawrence's suggestion, had been\r\napplied for to, and lent us by, the Nepalese Government.\r\n\r\nThe visit of Jung Bahadur (the Prime Minister of Nepal) to England a\r\nfew years before had opened his eyes to our latent power, and he had\r\nbeen able to convince his people that time alone was required for us\r\nto recover completely from the blow which had been dealt us by the\r\nMutiny, and that it was therefore to their advantage to side with us.\r\nLord Canning wisely judged, however, that it would be highly imprudent\r\nto allow the province immediately adjoining Nepal to continue in a\r\nstate of revolt, and he felt that neither Jung Bahadur nor his Gurkhas\r\nwould be satisfied unless they were allowed to take an active part in\r\nthe campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The late General Sir William Payn, K.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Tyrrell Ross was well known as a skilful surgeon, and\r\nmuch esteemed as a staunch friend. He had just returned from England,\r\nand had that very morning been placed in medical charge of the Cavalry\r\nBrigade. When the order to mount was given, Ross asked the General\r\nwhere he wished him to be, pointing out that he would not be of much\r\nuse in the rear if there were a pursuit across country. Hope Grant\r\nreplied: 'Quite so; I have heard that you are a good rider and can\r\nuse your sword. Ride on my left, and help to look after my third\r\nsquadron.' This Ross did as well as any Cavalry officer could have\r\ndone.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: For these two acts I was awarded the Victoria Cross.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Younghusband met with an extraordinary accident during\r\nthe fight at Agra. While pursuing one of the Gwalior rebels, he fell\r\nwith his horse into a disused well, fifty feet deep, and was followed\r\nby two of his men, also mounted. Ropes were brought, and the bodies\r\nwere hauled up, when, to the astonishment of everyone, Younghusband\r\nwas found to be alive, and, beyond being badly bruised, uninjured.\r\nHe had fallen to the bottom in a sitting position, his back resting\r\nagainst the side of the well, and his legs stretched out in front\r\nof him, while his horse fell standing and across him. He was thus\r\nprotected from the weight of the other two horses and their riders,\r\nwho were all killed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Now Major-General H.L.

Then, leaving Hope Grant to take\r\nthe division across the Ganges, the Chief went to Allahabad, the\r\ntemporary Head-Quarters of the supreme Government, to discuss the\r\nsituation with the Governor-General.\r\n\r\nWe marched through Cawnpore, and on the 8th February reached Unao,\r\nwhere we found encamped the 7th Hussars, a troop of Royal Horse\r\nArtillery, the 38th Foot and the 79th Highlanders.\r\n\r\nSir Colin on his return from Allahabad on the 10th issued a General\r\nOrder detailing the regiments, staff, and Commanders who were to take\r\npart in the 'Siege of Lucknow.'[1] Hope Grant, who had been made\r\na Major-General for the 'Relief of Lucknow,' was appointed to the\r\ncommand of the Cavalry division, and I remained with him as D.A.Q.M.G.\r\n\r\nRumours had been flying about that the Nana was somewhere in the\r\nneighbourhood, but 'Wolf!' had been cried so often with regard to him,\r\nthat but little notice was taken of the reports, until my faithful\r\nspy, Unjur Tiwari, brought me intelligence that the miscreant really\r\nwas hiding in a small fort about twenty-five miles from our camp. Hope\r\nGrant started off at once, taking with him a compact little force, and\r\nreached the fort early next morning (17th February), just too late\r\nto catch the Nana, who, we were told, had fled precipitately before\r\ndaybreak. We blew up the fort, and for the next few days moved by\r\nshort marches towards Lucknow, clearing the country as we went of\r\nrebels, small parties of whom we frequently encountered. On the 23rd\r\nwe reached Mianganj, a small fortified town on the old Cawnpore and\r\nLucknow road, where some 2,000 of the enemy had ensconced themselves.\r\nOur advance guard having been fired upon as we approached, the\r\ncolumn was halted and the baggage placed in safety, while Hope\r\nGrant reconnoitred the position in order to see where it could most\r\nadvantageously be attacked. We found the town enclosed by a high\r\nloop-holed wall with circular bastions at the four corners and at\r\nregular intervals along the sides, the whole being surrounded by a wet\r\nditch, while the gateways had been strengthened by palisades. Large\r\nbodies of the enemy's Cavalry hovered about our reconnoitring party,\r\nonly to retire as we advanced, apparently not liking the look of the\r\n7th Hussars and 9th Lancers, who formed the General's escort.\r\n\r\nAfter a careful inspection, Hope Grant decided to breach the\r\nnorth-west angle of the wall, as from a wood near the Infantry could\r\nkeep down the fire of the enemy's sharpshooters, and the heavy guns\r\nwould be in a measure protected while the walls were being bombarded.\r\nA sufficiently good breach was made in about two hours, and the 53rd\r\nRegiment, having been selected for the honour of leading the assault,\r\nwas told to hold itself in readiness. Hope Grant then spoke a few\r\nwords of encouragement to the men, and their Colonel (English) replied\r\non their behalf that they might be depended upon to do their duty. The\r\nsignal was given; the Horse Artillery, under Lieutenant-Colonel Frank\r\nTurner, galloped to within grape range of the town, and covered by\r\ntheir fire the 53rd marched in steadily until they got within 100\r\nyards of the walls, when, with a ringing cheer, they dashed through\r\nthe water in the ditch and entered the breach. Hopkins, the plucky\r\nCaptain of the light company, was the first inside the walls, followed\r\nclosely by Augustus Anson and an adventurous Post-Captain of the Royal\r\nNavy, who, being unemployed, came to see what 'a winter's campaign in\r\nIndia' was like.[2] There was a good deal of hand-to-hand fighting,\r\nand the enemy lost about 500 men, those who tried to escape being cut\r\ndown by the Cavalry outside the walls. We took about the same number\r\nof prisoners, but as none of these were soldiers, and vowed they had\r\nbeen forced to take up arms against us, the General, as much to their\r\nastonishment as to their delight, ordered them to be set free. Our\r\nlosses were small.\r\n\r\nNext day we halted while the walls were being destroyed and the\r\nplace rendered indefensible. As I was superintending the work of\r\ndestruction, the horrors of war were once more brought very forcibly\r\nbefore me by the appearance of an infirm old man, who besought me to\r\nspare his house, saying: 'Yesterday I was the happy father of five\r\nsons: three of them lie there' (pointing to a group of dead bodies);\r\n'where the other two are, God only knows. I am old and a cripple, and\r\nif my house is burned there is nothing left for me but to die.' Of\r\ncourse I took care that his house and property were left untouched.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th February we marched to Mohan, a picturesquely situated\r\nvillage on the bank of the Sai Naddi, which stream we crossed the next\r\nday and encamped on a fine grassy plain, there to remain until it\r\nshould be time to join the army before Lucknow.\r\n\r\nWhile we were halting at this place, Watson and I had rather a curious\r\nadventure. During a morning's ride my greyhound put up a _nilghai_[3]\r\nso close to us that Watson, aiming a blow at him with his sword,\r\ngashed his quarter. Off he started, and we after him at full speed;\r\nthe chase continued for some miles without our getting much nearer,\r\nwhen, all at once, we beheld moving towards us from our right front\r\na body of the enemy's Cavalry. We were in an awkward position; our\r\nhorses were very nearly dead beat, and we could hardly hope to get\r\naway if pursued. We pulled up, turned round, and trotted back, very\r\nquietly at first, that our horses might recover their breath before\r\nthe enemy got to closer quarters and we should have to ride for our\r\nlives. Every now and then we looked back to see whether they were\r\ngaining upon us, and at last we distinctly saw them open out and make\r\nas if to charge down upon us. We thought our last hour was come. We\r\nbade each other good-bye, agreeing that each must do his best to\r\nescape, and that neither was to wait for the other, when lo! as\r\nsuddenly as they had appeared, the horsemen vanished, as though the\r\nground had opened and swallowed them; there was nothing to be seen\r\nbut the open plain, where a second before there had been a crowd of\r\nmounted men. We could hardly believe our eyes, or comprehend at first\r\nthat what we had seen was simply a mirage, but so like reality that\r\nanyone must have been deceived. Our relief, on becoming convinced\r\nthat we had been scared by a phantom enemy, was considerable; but\r\nthe apparition had the good effect of making us realize the folly\r\nof having allowed ourselves to be tempted so far away from our camp\r\nwithout escort of any kind in an enemy's country, and we determined\r\nnot to risk it again.[4]\r\n\r\nWhile we were occupied in clearing the country to the north of\r\nthe Cawnpore-Lucknow road, the main body of the army, with the\r\nsiege-train, Engineer park, Naval Brigade,[5] ammunition, and stores\r\nof all kinds, had gradually been collecting at Bhantira, to which\r\nplace we were ordered to proceed on the 1st March. We had a\r\ntroublesome march across country, and did not reach the Head-Quarters\r\ncamp until close on midnight. There was much difficulty in getting the\r\nguns through the muddy nullas and up the steep banks, and but for\r\nthe assistance of the elephants the task could hardly have been\r\naccomplished. It was most curious and interesting to see how these\r\nsagacious creatures watched for and seized the moment when their help\r\nwas needed to get the guns up the steep inclines; they waited till\r\nthe horses dragging the gun could do no more and were coming to a\r\nstand-still, when one of them would place his forehead against the\r\nmuzzle and shove until the gun was safely landed on the top of the\r\nbank.\r\n\r\nWe started early on the morning of the 2nd for Lucknow, Hope Grant\r\ntaking command of the Cavalry division for the first time.\r\n\r\nOn nearing the Alambagh, we bore to our right past the Jalalabad fort,\r\nwhere Outram's Engineers were busily engaged in constructing fascines\r\nand gabions for the siege, and preparing spars and empty casks for\r\nbridging the Gumti. As we approached the Mahomedbagh we came under the\r\nfire of some of the enemy's guns placed in a grove of trees; but no\r\nsooner had the Artillery of our advance guard opened fire than the\r\nrebels retired, leaving a gun in our hands. We moved on to the\r\nDilkusha, which we found unoccupied. The park had been greatly\r\ndisfigured since our last visit, most of the finest trees having been\r\ncut down.\r\n\r\nMy General was now placed in charge of the piquets, a position for\r\nwhich he was admirably fitted and in which he delighted. He rode well,\r\nwithout fatigue to himself or his horse, so that any duty entailing\r\nlong hours in the saddle was particularly congenial to him. I\r\ninvariably accompanied him in his rounds, and in after-years I often\r\nfelt that I owed Hope Grant a debt of gratitude for the practical\r\nlessons he gave me in outpost duty.\r\n\r\nStrong piquets with heavy guns were placed in and around the Dilkusha,\r\nas well as in the Mahomedbagh. The main body of the army was encamped\r\nto the rear of the Dilkusha, its right almost on the Gumti, while its\r\nleft stretched for two miles in the direction of the Alambagh. Hope\r\nGrant, wishing to be in a convenient position in case of an attack,\r\nspent the night in the Mahomedbagh piquet, and Anson, the D.A.A.G.,\r\nand I kept him company.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd some of the troops left at Bhantira came into camp, and\r\non the 5th General Franks arrived. His division, together with\r\nthe Nepalese Contingent, 9,000 strong, brought the numbers at the\r\nCommander-in-Chief's disposal up to nearly 31,000 men, with 164\r\nguns;[6] not a man too many for the capture of a city twenty miles in\r\ncircumference, defended by 120,000 armed men, who for three months and\r\na half had worked incessantly at strengthening the defences, which\r\nconsisted of three lines, extending lengthwise from the Charbagh\r\nbridge to the Gumti, and in depth from the canal to the Kaisarbagh.\r\n\r\nIn Napier's carefully prepared plan, which Sir Colin decided to adopt,\r\nit was shown that the attack should be made on the east, as that\r\nside offered the smallest front, it afforded ground for planting\r\nour Artillery, which the west side did not, and it was the shortest\r\napproach to the Kaisarbagh, a place to which the rebels attached the\r\ngreatest importance; more than all, we knew the east side, and were\r\nlittle acquainted with the west. Napier further recommended that the\r\nattack should be accompanied by a flank movement on the north, with\r\nthe object of taking in reverse the first and second lines of the\r\nenemy's defences.[7] A division was accordingly sent across the\r\nGumti for this purpose, and the movement, being entirely successful,\r\nmaterially aided in the capture of the city. The passage of the river\r\nwas effected by means of two pontoon bridges made of empty barrels,\r\nand thrown across the stream a little below the Dilkusha. They were\r\ncompleted by midnight on the 5th March, and before day broke the\r\ntroops detailed for this service had crossed over.\r\n\r\nOutram, who, since the 'Relief of Lucknow,' had been maintaining his\r\nhigh reputation by keeping the enemy in check before the Alambagh,\r\ncommanded this division, with Hope Grant as his second in command. As\r\nsoon as it was light we moved away from the river to be out of reach\r\nof the Martinière guns, and after marching for about two miles we came\r\nin view of the enemy; the Artillery of the advance guard got to within\r\na thousand yards and opened fire, upon which the rebels broke and\r\nfled. The Bays pursued them for a short distance, but with very little\r\nresult, the ground being intersected with nullas, and the enemy\r\nopening upon them with heavy guns, they had to retire precipitately,\r\nwith the loss of their Major, Percy Smith, whose body, unhappily, had\r\nto be abandoned.\r\n\r\nAbout noon we encamped close to Chinhut, and Hope Grant took special\r\ncare that day to see the piquets were well placed, for the rebels\r\nwere in great numbers, and we were surrounded by ravines and wooded\r\nenclosures. It was thought by some that he was unnecessarily anxious\r\nand careful, for he rode several times over the ground; but the next\r\nmorning proved how right he was to leave nothing to chance.\r\n\r\nWhile we were at breakfast, information was brought in that the enemy\r\nwere advancing in force, and directly afterwards half a dozen round\r\nshot were sent into our camp; the troops fell in, the Infantry moved\r\nout, and Hope Grant took the Horse Artillery and Cavalry to our right\r\nflank, where the mutineers were collected in considerable numbers. In\r\nless than an hour we had driven them off, but we were not allowed to\r\nfollow them up, as Outram did not wish to get entangled in the suburbs\r\nuntil heavy guns had arrived. The piquets were strengthened and pushed\r\nforward, affording another opportunity for a useful lesson in outpost\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nAll that day and the next I accompanied my General in his\r\nreconnaissance of the enemy's position, as well as of the ground near\r\nthe Gumti, in order to determine where the heavy guns could best\r\nbe placed, so as effectually to enfilade the enemy's first line of\r\ndefences along the bank of the canal. On returning to report progress\r\nto Outram at mid-day on the 8th, we found Sir Colin Campbell and\r\nMansfield with him, arranging for a joint attack the following day;\r\nafter their consultation was over, they all rode with us to see the\r\nsite Hope Grant had selected for the battery. It was a slightly\r\nelevated piece of ground about half a mile north of the Kokrel nulla,\r\nfairly concealed by a bend of the river; but before it could be made\r\nuse of it was considered necessary to clear the rebels out of the\r\nposition they were occupying between the nulla and the iron bridge,\r\nthe key to which was the Chakar Kothi, and Outram was directed to\r\nattack this point the next morning.\r\n\r\nAt 2 a.m. on the 9th the heavy guns, escorted by the 1st Bengal\r\nFusiliers, were sent forward to within 600 yards of the enemy.\r\nThe troops then moved off in two parties, that on the right being\r\ncommanded by Hope Grant. We marched along the Fyzabad road, the two\r\nRifle Brigade battalions leading the way in skirmishing order, with\r\nthe Cavalry well away to the right. The rebels retired as we advanced,\r\nand Walpole, commanding one of our brigades, by wheeling to his left\r\non reaching the opposite bank of the nulla, was enabled to enfilade\r\ntheir position. The column was then halted, and I was sent to inform\r\nOutram as to our progress.\r\n\r\nWhen I had delivered my message, and was about to return, Outram\r\ndesired me to stay with him until the capture of the Chakar Kothi\r\n(which he was just about to attempt) should be accomplished, that I\r\nmight then convey to Hope Grant his orders as to what further action\r\nwould be required of him; meanwhile Outram sent a messenger to tell\r\nmy General what he was about to do, in view of his co-operating on the\r\nright.[8]\r\n\r\nThe Chakar Kothi was attacked and taken, and the enemy, apparently\r\nhaving lost heart, fled precipitately. One of the 1st Bengal\r\nFusiliers' colours was placed on the top of this three-storied\r\nbuilding by Ensign Jervis to show the Commander-in-Chief that it was\r\nin our possession, and that the time had come for him to attack the\r\nfirst line of the enemy's defences. We then continued our advance to\r\nthe river, where the parties united, and I rejoined Hope Grant.\r\n\r\nIt was now only 2 p.m., and there was plenty of time to place the\r\nheavy guns in position before dark. Major Lothian Nicholson,[9]\r\nOutram's Commanding Engineer, was superintending this operation, when\r\nhe thought he perceived that the enemy had abandoned their first line,\r\nbut he could not be quite sure. It was most necessary to ascertain for\r\ncertain whether this was the case, as the Infantry of Hope's brigade,\r\nwhich had attacked and driven the rebels out of the Martinière, could\r\nbe seen preparing to assault the works at the other side of the river.\r\nA discussion ensued as to how this knowledge could be obtained, and a\r\nyoung subaltern of the 1st Bengal Fusiliers, named Butler,[10] offered\r\nto swim across the Gumti, and, if he found the enemy had retired,\r\nto communicate the fact to Hope's men. This feat was successfully\r\naccomplished by the plucky young volunteer; he found the enemy had\r\nretired, and, on giving the information to Hope, the brigade advanced,\r\nand before nightfall the whole of the enemy's first line was in our\r\npossession--a success which had been achieved with but slight loss to\r\nus, the chief casualty during the day being William Peel, the gallant\r\nCommander of the Naval Brigade, who had been seriously wounded while\r\nin command of a battery near the Dilkusha.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 10th, Outram's camp was moved close up to the Gumti,\r\nand batteries were constructed from which fire could be poured on the\r\nmess-house and the Kaisarbagh. For the protection of these works,\r\nand to prevent an attack in force being made on the main part of the\r\ncolumn, Hope Grant kept moving about with the Horse Artillery and\r\nCavalry between the river and the Sitapur road, our reconnaissance\r\nextending beyond the old cantonment. We had several little fights,\r\nin one of which a very promising officer named Sandford, who had\r\nsucceeded Younghusband in command of the 5th Punjab Cavalry squadron,\r\nwas killed.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak on the morning of the 11th the batteries opened fire on\r\nthe enemy's second line of defence; at the same time Outram himself\r\nled a strong body of Infantry along the river with the object of\r\nsecuring the approaches to the bridges. On reaching the Fyzabad road,\r\nabout half a mile from the iron bridge, Outram placed the 1st Bengal\r\nFusiliers in a mosque, with orders to entrench themselves and hold\r\nthe post, while he pushed on to the stone bridge about a mile away.\r\nOutram's advance was covered by Hope Grant's Horse Artillery and\r\nCavalry, but we had to keep at some distance away to the right, in\r\norder to avoid houses and walled enclosures. Soon after crossing the\r\nSitapur road we heard guns to our left, and proceeding at a smart\r\ntrot, came up with Outram just as he was about to attack a large body\r\nof the rebels, who, finding themselves in an awkward position, with\r\nthe river in their rear and their retreat by the iron bridge cut off,\r\nmade but a feeble resistance before they broke and fled. Some few\r\nescaped by the stone bridge, but the greater number, including the\r\nwhole of the mutinous 15th Irregular Cavalry, made for the old\r\ncantonment. We pursued with our Cavalry, and very few of them got\r\naway. A couple of guns and a quantity of plunder were left behind by\r\nthe enemy, who evidently had not expected us and were quite unprepared\r\nfor our attack. Outram pushed on to the stone bridge, but finding he\r\nwas losing men from the fire poured upon us by the rebels from the\r\nopposite side of the river, he fell back to the mosque where he had\r\nleft the Fusiliers.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, as there was nothing particular for the Cavalry to do,\r\nthe General, Anson, and I rode across the river to see how matters\r\nwere progressing on the left of the attack. We reached the\r\nHead-Quarters camp just as Sir Colin was about to receive a visit of\r\nceremony from the Nepalese General, the famous Jung Bahadur. Our old\r\nChief, in honour of the occasion, had doffed his usual workman-like\r\ncostume, and wore General's full-dress uniform, but he was quite\r\nthrown into the shade by the splendour of the Gurkha Prince, who was\r\nmost gorgeously attired, with magnificent jewels in his turban, round\r\nhis neck, and on his coat.\r\n\r\nI looked at Jung Bahadur with no small interest, for his deeds of\r\ndaring had made him conspicuous amongst probably the bravest race of\r\nmen in the world, and the fact that a high-born Hindu, such as he was,\r\nshould, fifty years ago, have so far risen superior to caste prejudice\r\nas to cross the sea and visit England, proved him to be a man of\r\nunusually strong and independent mind. He was about five feet eight\r\ninches high--tall for a Gurkha--with a well-knit, wiry figure, a\r\nkeen, dauntless eye, and a firm, determined mouth--in every respect a\r\ntypical, well-bred Nepalese. The interview did not last long, for Sir\r\nColin disliked ceremonial, and, shortly after the Nepalese Prince had\r\ntaken his seat, news was brought in that the assault on the Begum\r\nKothi had been successfully completed, upon which Sir Colin made the\r\nnecessity for attending to business an excuse for taking leave of his\r\ndistinguished visitor, and the interview came to an end.\r\n\r\nI then obtained leave to go to the scene of the recent fight, and,\r\ngalloping across the canal by the bridge near Banks's house, soon\r\nfound myself at the Begum Kothi. There I was obliged to dismount, for\r\neven on foot it was a difficult matter to scramble over the breach.\r\nThe place was most formidable, and it was a marvel that it had been\r\ntaken with comparatively so little loss on our side. The bodies of a\r\nnumber of Highlanders and Punjabis were lying about, and a good many\r\nwounded men were being attended to, but our casualties were nothing in\r\nproportion to those of the enemy, 600 or 700 of whom were buried\r\nthe next day in the ditch they had themselves dug for their own\r\nprotection. A very determined stand had been made by the sepoys when\r\nthey found there was no chance of getting away. There were many tales\r\nof hair-breadth escapes and desperate struggles, and on all sides I\r\nhoard laments that Hodson should have been one of those dangerously,\r\nif not mortally, wounded in the strife. Hodson had been carried to\r\nBanks's house, and to the inquiry I made on my way back to camp, as to\r\nhis condition, the answer was, 'Little, if any, hope.'\r\n\r\nA great stride in the advance had been made on this day. Outram\r\nhad accomplished all that was expected of him, and he was now\r\nbusy constructing additional batteries for the bombardment of the\r\nKaisarbagh; while Lugard,[11] from his newly-acquired position at the\r\nBegum Kothi, was also able to bring fire to bear upon that doomed\r\npalace.\r\n\r\nHodson died the following day (the 12th). As a soldier, I had a very\r\ngreat admiration, for him, and, in common with the whole army, I\r\nmourned his early death.[12]\r\n\r\nOn the 13th Lugard's division was relieved by Franks's, and to Jung\r\nBahadur and his Gurkhas, only too eager for the fray, was entrusted\r\nthe conduct of operations along the line of the canal between Banks's\r\nhouse and the Charbagh bridge. On our side of the river nothing of\r\nimportance occurred.\r\n\r\nThe capture of the Imambara (a mosque situated between the Begum Kothi\r\nand the Kaisarbagh) was accomplished early next morning. The assault\r\nwas led by Brasyer's Sikhs and a detachment of the 10th Foot,\r\nsupported by the remainder of that regiment and the 90th Light\r\nInfantry. After a short but very severe struggle, the enemy were\r\nforced to retire, and were so closely pursued that the storming party\r\nsuddenly found themselves in a building immediately overlooking the\r\nKaisarbagh.\r\n\r\nIt had not been intended to advance that day beyond the Imambara,\r\nbut, recognizing the advantage of the position thus gained, and the\r\ndemoralized condition of the rebels, Franks wisely determined to\r\nfollow up his success. Reinforcements were hurried forward, the troops\r\nholding the Sikandarbagh and the Shah Najaf were ordered to act in\r\nconcert, and before nightfall the Kaisarbagh, the mess-house, and the\r\nnumerous buildings situated between those places and the Residency,\r\nwere in our possession.\r\n\r\nBy means of the field telegraph, Outram was kept accurately informed\r\nas to the movements of Franks's division, and he could have afforded\r\nit valuable assistance had he been allowed to cross the Gumti with his\r\nthree brigades of Infantry. Outram, with his soldierly instinct, felt\r\nthat this was the proper course to pursue; but in reply to his request\r\nto be allowed to push over the river by the iron bridge, he received\r\nfrom the Commander-in-Chief through Mansfield the unaccountably\r\nstrange order that he must not attempt it, if it would entail his\r\nlosing 'a single man.' Thus a grand opportunity was lost. The bridge,\r\nno doubt, was strongly held, but with the numerous guns which Outram\r\ncould have brought to bear upon its defenders its passage could have\r\nbeen forced without serious loss; the enemy's retreat would have been\r\ncut off, and Franks's victory would have been rendered complete,\r\nwhich it certainly was not, owing to Outram's hands having been so\r\neffectually tied.\r\n\r\nLucknow was practically in our hands on the evening of the 14th March,\r\nbut the rebels escaped with comparatively slight punishment, and the\r\ncampaign, which should have then come to an end, was protracted for\r\nnearly a year by the fugitives spreading themselves over Oudh, and\r\noccupying forts and other strong positions, from which they were able\r\nto offer resistance to our troops until towards the end of May, 1859,\r\nthus causing the needless loss of thousands of British soldiers.[13]\r\nSir Colin saw his mistake when too late. The next day orders were\r\nissued for the Cavalry to follow up the mutineers, who were understood\r\nto have fled in a northerly direction. One brigade under Campbell (the\r\nColonel of the Bays) was directed to proceed to Sandila, and another,\r\nunder Hope Grant, towards Sitapur. But the enemy was not seen by\r\neither. As usual, they had scattered themselves over the country and\r\nentirely disappeared, and many of the rebels who still remained in the\r\ncity seized the opportunity of the Cavalry being absent to get away.\r\n\r\nOutram's command on the left bank of the Gumti was now broken up, with\r\nthe view to his completing the occupation of the city. Accordingly, on\r\nthe 16th, he advanced from the Kaisarbagh with Douglas's brigade[14]\r\nand Middleton's battery, supported by the 20th Foot and Brasyer's\r\nSikhs, and occupied in quick succession, and with but slight\r\nresistance, the Residency, the Machi Bhawan, and the great Imambara,\r\nthus taking in reverse the defences which had been thrown up by the\r\nenemy for the protection of the two bridges. As Outram pushed on, the\r\nrebels retreated, some across the stone bridge towards Fyzabad, and\r\nsome through the city towards the Musabagh. They made two attacks to\r\ncover their retirement, one on Walpole's piquets, which enabled\r\na large number (20,000 it was said) to get away in the Fyzabad\r\ndirection, and another on the Alambagh, which was much more serious,\r\nfor the garrison had been reduced to less than a thousand men, and the\r\nrebels' force was considerable, consisting of Infantry, Cavalry and\r\nArtillery. They attacked with great determination, and fought for four\r\nhours and a half before they were driven off.\r\n\r\nIt was not a judicious move on Sir Colin's part to send the Cavalry\r\nmiles away from Lucknow just when they could have been so usefully\r\nemployed on the outskirts of the city. This was also appreciated when\r\ntoo late, and both brigades were ordered to return, which they did on\r\nthe 17th. Even then the Cavalry were not made full use of, for instead\r\nof both brigades being collected on the Lucknow bank of the river,\r\nwhich was now the sole line of retreat left open to the enemy (the\r\nbridges being in our possession), one only (Campbell's) was sent\r\nthere, Hope Grant being directed to take up his old position on the\r\nopposite side of the Gumti, from which we had the mortification of\r\nwatching the rebels streaming into the open country from the Musabagh,\r\nwithout the smallest attempt being made by Campbell to stop or pursue\r\nthem. His brigade had been placed on the enemy's line of retreat on\r\npurpose to intercept them, but he completely failed to do what was\r\nexpected of him. We, on our side, could do nothing, for an unfordable\r\nriver flowed between us and the escaping mutineers.[15]\r\n\r\nThere was one more fight in Lucknow. The Moulvie[16] of Fyzabad (who\r\nfrom the first was one of the prominent leaders of the rebellion) had\r\nreturned at the head of a considerable force, and had placed himself\r\nin a strongly-fortified position in the very centre of the city. It\r\nwas not without a severe struggle that he was dislodged by the 93rd\r\nHighlanders and 4th Punjab Infantry under Lugard. The brunt of the\r\nfighting fell upon the last-named regiment, the gallant Commander\r\n(Wilde) of which, and his second in command,[17] were severely\r\nwounded. The Moulvie made his escape, but his followers were pursued,\r\nand many of them were cut up. Thus at last the city was cleared of\r\nrebels, and we were once more masters in Lucknow.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd March Hope Grant was ordered to proceed to Kursi, a small\r\ntown about twenty-five miles off between the Sitapur and Fyzabad\r\nroads, reported to be occupied in force by the enemy.\r\n\r\nWe started at midnight with a brigade of Infantry, 1,000 Cavalry, two\r\ntroops of Horse Artillery, and eight heavy guns and mortars. We were\r\ndelayed some hours by the heavy guns and their escort (the 53rd Foot)\r\ntaking a wrong turn when leaving the city, which resulted in the enemy\r\nbeing warned of our approach in time to clear out before we arrived.\r\n\r\nOn hearing they had gone, Hope Grant pushed on with the mounted\r\nportion of the force, and we soon came in sight of the enemy in full\r\nretreat. The Cavalry, commanded by Captain Browne,[18] was ordered\r\nto pursue. It consisted of Browne's own regiment (the 2nd Punjab\r\nCavalry), a squadron of the 1st Punjab Cavalry under Captain Cosserat,\r\nand three Horse Artillery guns. At the end of two miles, Browne came\r\nupon a body of the mutineers formed up on an open plain. The Cavalry\r\ncharged through them three times, each time thinning their ranks\r\nconsiderably, but they never wavered, and in the final charge avenged\r\nthemselves by killing Macdonnell (the Adjutant of the 2nd Punjab\r\nCavalry), and mortally wounding Cosserat. I arrived on the ground with\r\nHope Grant just in time to witness the last charge and the fall of\r\nthese two officers, and deplorable as we felt their loss to be, it was\r\nimpossible not to admire the gallantry and steadiness of the sepoys,\r\nevery one of whom fought to the death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL SIR SAMUEL BROWNE, V.C., G.C.B., K.C.S.I.\r\n_From a photograph by Messrs. Elliott and Fry._]\r\n\r\nAs soon as Browne could got his men together, the pursuit of the enemy\r\nwas continued; no further opposition was met with, and fourteen guns\r\nfell into our hands.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th we retraced our steps, halting for the night at the old\r\ncantonment of Muriao, where we buried poor Macdonnell. On the 25th we\r\ncrossed the Gumti, and pitched our camp near the Dilkusha.\r\n\r\nLucknow was now completely in our possession, and our success had been\r\nachieved with remarkably slight loss, a result which was chiefly\r\ndue to the scientific manner in which the siege operations had been\r\ncarried on under the direction of our talented Chief Engineer, Robert\r\nNapier, ably assisted by Colonel Harness; and also to the good use\r\nwhich Sir Colin Campbell made of his powerful force of Artillery. Our\r\ncasualties during the siege amounted to only 16 British officers, 3\r\nNative officers, and 108 men killed; 51 British officers, 4 Native\r\nofficers, and 540 men wounded, while 13 men were unaccounted for.\r\n\r\nThe capture of Lucknow, though not of such supreme importance in its\r\nconsequences as the taking of Delhi, must have convinced the rebels\r\nthat their cause was now hopeless. It is true that Jhansi had not yet\r\nfallen, and that the rest of Oudh, Rohilkand, and the greater part\r\nof Central India remained to be conquered, but there was no very\r\nimportant city in the hands of the enemy, and the subjugation of the\r\ncountry was felt to be merely a matter of time. Sir Hugh Rose, after a\r\nbrilliant campaign, had arrived before Jhansi, columns of our troops\r\nwere traversing the country in every direction, and the British Army\r\nhad been so largely increased that, on the 1st of April, 1858, there\r\nwere 96,000 British soldiers in India, besides a large body of\r\nreliable Native troops, some of whom, although hurriedly raised, had\r\nalready shown that they were capable of doing good service--a very\r\ndifferent state of affairs from that which prevailed six months\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nFor some time I had been feeling the ill effects of exposure to the\r\nclimate and hard work, and the doctor, Campbell Browne, had been\r\nurging me to go on the sick-list; that, of course, was out of the\r\nquestion until Lucknow had fallen. Now, however, I placed myself in\r\nBrowne's hands, hoping that a change to the Hills was all that was\r\nneeded to set me up; but the doctors insisted on a trip to England. It\r\nwas a heavy blow to me to have to leave while there was still work to\r\nbe done, but I had less hesitation than I should have had if most\r\nof my own immediate friends had not already gone. Several had been\r\nkilled, others had left sick or wounded; Watson had gone to Lahore,\r\nbusily engaged in raising a regiment of Cavalry;[19] Probyn was on his\r\nway home, invalided; Hugh Gough had gone to the Hills to recover from\r\nhis wounds; and Norman and Stewart were about to leave Lucknow with\r\nArmy Head-Quarters.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st April, the sixth anniversary of my arrival in\r\nIndia, I made over my office to Wolseley, who succeeded me as\r\nDeputy-Assistant-Quartermaster-General on Hope Grant's staff, and\r\ntowards the middle of the month I left Lucknow.\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief was most kind and complimentary when I took\r\nleave of him, and told me that, in consideration of my services,\r\nhe would bestow upon me the first permanent vacancy in the\r\nQuartermaster-General's Department, and that he intended to recommend\r\nthat I should be given the rank of Brevet-Major so soon as I should\r\nbe qualified by becoming a regimental Captain. I was, of course, much\r\ngratified by his appreciative words and kindly manner; but the brevet\r\nseemed a long way off, for I had only been a First Lieutenant for less\r\nthan a year, and there were more than a hundred officers in the Bengal\r\nArtillery senior to me in that rank!\r\n\r\nI marched to Cawnpore with Army Head-Quarters. Sir William Peel, who\r\nwas slowly recovering from his wound, was of the party. We reached\r\nCawnpore on the 17th, and the next day I said good-bye to my friends\r\non the Chief's staff. Peel and I dined together on the 19th, when to\r\nall appearances he was perfectly well, but on going into his room\r\nthe next morning I found he was in a high fever, and had some\r\nsuspicious-looking spots about his face. I went off at once in search\r\nof a doctor, and soon returned with one of the surgeons of the 5th\r\nFusiliers, who, to my horror--for I had observed that Peel was nervous\r\nabout himself--exclaimed with brutal frankness the moment he entered\r\nthe room, 'You have got small-pox.' It was only too true. On being\r\nconvinced that this was the case, I went to the chaplain, the Rev.\r\nThomas Moore, and told him of Peel's condition. Without an instant's\r\nhesitation, he decided the invalid must come to his house to be taken\r\ncare of. That afternoon I had the poor fellow carried over, and there\r\nI left him in the kind hands of Mrs. Moore, the _padre's_ wife, who\r\nhad, as a special case, been allowed to accompany her husband to\r\nCawnpore. Peel died on the 27th. On the 4th May I embarked at Calcutta\r\nin the P. and O. steamer _Nubia_, without, alas! the friend whose\r\npleasant companionship I had hoped to have enjoyed on the voyage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN TO ILLUSTRATE THE SIEGE AND CAPTURE OF LUCKNOW,\r\nMarch, 1858]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Infantry portion of the army was divided into three\r\ndivisions, commanded respectively by Outram, Lugard, and Walpole. This\r\nwas exclusive of Franks's column, which joined at Lucknow and made a\r\nfourth division. The Artillery was placed under Archdale Wilson, and\r\nthe Engineers under Robert Napier. Sir Colin's selection of Commanders\r\ncaused considerable heart-burnings, especially amongst the senior\r\nofficers who had been sent out from England for the purpose of being\r\nemployed in the field. But, as the Chief explained to the Duke of\r\nCambridge, the selection had been made with the greatest care, it\r\nhaving been found that 'an officer unexperienced in war in India\r\ncannot act for himself ... it is quite impossible for him to be able\r\nto weigh the value of intelligence ... he cannot judge what are the\r\nresources of the country, and he is totally unable to make an estimate\r\nfor himself of the resistance the enemy opposed to him is likely to\r\noffer.' Sir Colin wound up his letter as follows: 'I do not wish to\r\nundervalue the merits of General or other officers lately arrived\r\nfrom England, but merely to indicate to your Royal Highness the\r\ndifficulties against which they have to contend. What is more, the\r\nstate of things at present does not permit of trusting anything to\r\nchance, or allowing new-comers to learn, except under the command of\r\nothers.'--Shadwell's 'Life of Lord Clyde.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The late Captain Oliver Jones, who published his\r\nexperiences under that title.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Literally 'blue cow,' one of the bovine antelopes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: A few days afterwards, when we were some miles from the\r\nscene of our adventure, I was awakened one morning by the greyhound\r\nlicking my face; she had cleverly found me out in the midst of a large\r\ncrowded camp.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Peel had changed his 24-pounders for the more powerful\r\n64-pounders belonging to H.M.S. _Shannon_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6:\r\n\r\n  Naval Brigade                   431\r\n  Artillery                     1,745\r\n  Engineers                       865\r\n  Cavalry                       3,169\r\n  Infantry                     12,498\r\n  Franks's Division             2,880\r\n  Nepalese Contingent           9,000\r\n                               ------\r\n                               30,588]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Kaye, in his 'History of the Indian Mutiny,' gives\r\nthe credit for originating this movement to the Commander-in-Chief\r\nhimself; but the present Lord Napier of Magdala has letters in his\r\npossession which clearly prove that the idea was his father's,\r\nand there is a passage in General Porter's 'History of the Royal\r\nEngineers,' vol. ii., p. 476, written after he had read Napier's\r\nletters to Sir Colin Campbell, which leaves no room for doubt as to my\r\nversion being the correct one.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Outram's division consisted of the 23rd Royal Welsh\r\nFusiliers, 79th Highlanders, 2nd and 3rd battalions of the Rifle\r\nBrigade, 1st Bengal Fusiliers, 2nd Punjab Infantry, D'Aguilar's,\r\nRemmington's and Mackinnon's troops of Horse Artillery, Gibbon's and\r\nMiddleton's Field Batteries, and some Heavy guns, 2nd Dragoon Guards,\r\n9th Lancers, 2nd Punjab Cavalry, and Watson's and Sandford's squadrons\r\nof the 1st and 5th Punjab Cavalry.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: The late Lieutenant-General Sir Lothian Nicholson,\r\nK.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Now Colonel Thomas Butler, V.C.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Now General the Right Hon.

Hodson was sitting with Donald Stewart in the\r\nHead-Quarters camp, when the signal-gun announced that the attack on\r\nthe Begum Kothi was about to take place. Hodson immediately mounted\r\nhis horse, and rode off in the direction of the city. Stewart, who had\r\nbeen ordered by the Commander-in-Chief to accompany the troops, and\r\nsend an early report to his Excellency of the result of the assault,\r\nhad his horse ready, and followed Hodson so closely that he kept him\r\nin sight until within a short distance of the fighting, when Stewart\r\nstopped to speak to the officer in charge of Peel's guns, which had\r\nbeen covering the advance of the troops. This delayed Stewart for a\r\nfew minutes only, and as he rode into the court-yard of the palace a\r\nHighland soldier handed him a pistol, saying, 'This is your pistol,\r\nsir; but I thought you were carried away mortally wounded a short time\r\nago?' Stewart at once conjectured that the man had mistaken him for\r\nHodson. In face they were not much alike, but both were tall, well\r\nmade and fair, and Native soldiers had frequently saluted one for the\r\nother. It is clear from this account that Hodson could not have been\r\nlooting, as he was wounded almost as soon as he reached the palace.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: In the month of May, 1858, alone, not less than a\r\nthousand British soldiers died of sunstroke, fatigue and disease, and\r\nabout a hundred were killed in action.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Consisting of the 23rd Fusiliers, 79th Highlanders, and\r\n1st Bengal Fusiliers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Captain Wale, a gallant officer who commanded a newly\r\nraised corps of Sikh Cavalry, lost his life on this occasion.

With\r\n230 sabres of his own regiment and 350 Native Infantry, he attacked a\r\nparty of rebels who had taken up a position at Nuria, a village at the\r\nedge of the Terai, about ten miles from Pilibhit. Browne managed to\r\nget to the rear of the enemy without being discovered; a hand-to-hand\r\nfight then ensued, in which he got two severe wounds--one on the knee,\r\nfrom which he nearly bled to death, the other on the left shoulder,\r\ncutting right through the arm.

Mahomedans looked back to the days of their Empire in India,\r\nbut failed to remember how completely, until we broke the Mahratta\r\npower, the Hindus had got the upper hand. Their Moulvies taught them\r\nthat it was only lawful for true Mussulmans to submit to the rule of\r\nan infidel if there was no possibility of successful revolt, and they\r\nwatched for the chance of again being able to make Islam supreme. The\r\nHindus had not forgotten that they had ousted the Mahomedans, and they\r\nfancied that the fate of the British _raj_ might also be at their\r\nmercy.\r\n\r\nThe late Sir George Campbell, in his interesting memoirs, says: 'The\r\nMutiny was a sepoy revolt, not a Hindu rebellion.' I do not altogether\r\nagree with him; for, although there was no general rising of the rural\r\npopulation, the revolt, in my judgment, would never have taken place\r\nhad there not been a feeling of discontent and disquiet throughout\r\nthat part of the country from which our Hindustani sepoys chiefly\r\ncame, and had not certain influential people been thoroughly\r\ndissatisfied with our system of government. This discontent and\r\ndissatisfaction were produced by a policy which, in many instances,\r\nthe Rulers of India were powerless to avoid or postpone, forced upon\r\nthem as it was by the demands of civilization and the necessity for a\r\nmore enlightened legislation. Intriguers took advantage of this state\r\nof affairs to further their own ends. Their plan of action was to\r\nalienate the Native army, and to increase the general feeling of\r\nuneasiness and suspicion, by spreading false reports as to the\r\nintentions of the authorities in regard to the various measures which\r\nhad been adopted to promote the welfare and prosperity of the masses.\r\nIt can hardly be questioned that these measures were right and proper\r\nin themselves, but they were on that account none the less obnoxious\r\nto the Brahmin priesthood, or distasteful to the Natives generally.\r\nIn some cases also they were premature, and in others they were not\r\ncarried out as judiciously as they might have been, or with sufficient\r\nregard to the feelings and prejudices of the people.\r\n\r\nThe prohibition of _sati_ (burning widows on the funeral pyres of\r\ntheir husbands); the putting a stop to female infanticide; the\r\nexecution of Brahmins for capital offences; the efforts of\r\nmissionaries and the protection of their converts; the removal of all\r\nlegal obstacles to the remarriage of widows; the spread of western and\r\nsecular education generally; and, more particularly, the attempt to\r\nintroduce female education, were causes of alarm and disgust to the\r\nBrahmins, and to those Hindus of high caste whose social privileges\r\nwere connected with the Brahminical religion. Those arbiters of\r\nfate, who were until then all-powerful to control every act of their\r\nco-religionists, social, religious or political, were quick to\r\nperceive that their influence was menaced, and that their sway would\r\nin time be wrested from them, unless they could devise some means for\r\noverthrowing our Government. They knew full well that the groundwork\r\nof this influence was ignorance and superstition, and they stood\r\naghast at what they foresaw would be the inevitable result of\r\nenlightenment and progress. Railways and telegraphs were specially\r\ndistasteful to the Brahmins: these evidences of ability and strength\r\nwere too tangible to be pooh-poohed or explained away. Moreover,\r\nrailways struck a direct blow at the system of caste, for on them\r\npeople of every caste, high and low, were bound to travel together.\r\n\r\nThe fears and antagonism of the Brahmins being thus aroused, it\r\nwas natural that they should wish to see our rule upset, and they\r\nproceeded to poison the minds of the people with tales of the\r\nGovernment's determination to force Christianity upon them, and\r\nto make them believe that the continuance of our power meant the\r\ndestruction of all they held most sacred.\r\n\r\nNor was opportunity wanting to confirm, apparently, the truth of their\r\nassertions. In the gaols a system of messing had been established\r\nwhich interfered with the time-honoured custom of every man being\r\nallowed to provide and cook his own food. This innovation was most\r\nproperly introduced as a matter of gaol discipline, and due care was\r\ntaken that the food of the Hindu prisoners should be prepared by\r\ncooks of the same or superior caste. Nevertheless, false reports were\r\ndisseminated, and the credulous Hindu population was led to believe\r\nthat the prisoners' food was in future to be prepared by men of\r\ninferior caste, with the object of defiling and degrading those for\r\nwhom it was prepared. The news of what was supposed to have happened\r\nin the gaols spread from town to town and from village to village,\r\nthe belief gradually gaining ground that the people were about to be\r\nforced to embrace Christianity.\r\n\r\nAs the promiscuous messing story did not greatly concern the\r\nMahomedans, other cries were made use of to create suspicion and\r\ndistrust amongst the followers of the Prophet. One of these, which\r\nequally affected the Hindu and Mahomedan, was the alleged unfairness\r\nof what was known in India as the land settlement, under which system\r\nthe right and title of each landholder to his property was examined,\r\nand the amount of revenue to be paid by him to the paramount Power, as\r\nowner of the soil, was regulated.\r\n\r\nThe rapid acquisition of territory by the East India Company, and\r\nthe establishment of its supremacy as the sovereign Power throughout\r\nIndia, were necessarily effected by military operations; but as peace\r\nand order were established, the system of land revenue, which had\r\nbeen enforced in an extremely oppressive and corrupt manner under\r\nsuccessive Native Rulers and dynasties, had to be investigated and\r\nrevised. With this object in view, surveys were made, and inquiries\r\ninstituted into the rights of ownership and occupancy, the result\r\nbeing that in many cases it was found that families of position and\r\ninfluence had either appropriated the property of their humbler\r\nneighbours, or evaded an assessment proportionate to the value of\r\ntheir estates. Although these inquiries were carried out with the best\r\nintentions, they were extremely distasteful to the higher classes,\r\nwhile they failed to conciliate the masses. The ruling families deeply\r\nresented our endeavours to introduce an equitable determination of\r\nrights and assessment of land revenue. They saw that it would put an\r\nend to the system of pillage and extortion which had been practised\r\nfrom time immemorial; they felt that their authority was being\r\ndiminished, and that they would no longer be permitted to govern their\r\nestates in the same despotic manner as formerly. On the other hand,\r\nalthough the agricultural population generally benefited materially\r\nby our rule, they could not realize the benevolent intentions of a\r\nGovernment which tried to elevate their position and improve their\r\nprospects. Moreover, there were no doubt mistakes made in the\r\nvaluation of land, some of it being assessed at too high a rate, while\r\nthe revenue was sometimes collected in too rigid a manner, sufficient\r\nallowance not being made for the failure of crops. Then the harsh\r\nlaw for the sale of proprietary rights in land to realize arrears of\r\nland-tax was often enforced by careless revenue authorities in far too\r\nsummary a manner. The peasantry of India were, and still are, ignorant\r\nand apathetic. Accustomed from the earliest days to spoliation and\r\noppression, and to a periodical change of masters, they had some\r\nreason to doubt whether the rule of the Feringhis would be more\r\npermanent than that of the Moghuls or the Mahrattas. Much as a just\r\nand tolerant Government would have been to their advantage, they were\r\nunable to appreciate it, and if they had appreciated it, they were too\r\ntimid and too wanting in organization to give it their open support.\r\nUnder these social and political conditions, the passive attitude of\r\nthe rural population failed to counterbalance the active hostility\r\nof a large section of the upper classes, and of their predatory\r\nfollowers, who for centuries had lived by plunder and civil war.\r\n\r\nAnother weighty cause of discontent, chiefly affecting the wealthy and\r\ninfluential classes, and giving colour to the Brahmins' accusation\r\nthat we intended to upset the religion and violate the most cherished\r\ncustoms of the Hindus, was Lord Dalhousie's strict enforcement of\r\nthe doctrine of the lapse of property in the absence of direct or\r\ncollateral heirs, and the consequent appropriation of certain Native\r\nStates, and the resumption of certain political pensions by the\r\nGovernment of India. This was condemned by the people of India as\r\ngrasping, and as an unjustifiable interference with the institutions\r\nof the country, and undoubtedly made us many enemies.[1]\r\n\r\nLater on, the annexation of Oudh, which was one of those measures\r\nforced on the Rulers of India in the interests of humanity and good\r\ngovernment, and which could hardly have been longer delayed, created\r\nsuspicion and apprehension amongst all the Native States. For more\r\nthan sixty years Governor-General after Governor-General had pointed\r\nout the impossibility of a civilized Government tolerating in the\r\nmidst of its possessions the misrule, disorder, and debauchery\r\nwhich were desolating one of the most fertile and thickly-populated\r\ndistricts in India.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1801 Lord Wellesley wrote: 'I am satisfied that no\r\neffectual security can be provided against the ruin of the province\r\nof Oudh until the exclusive management of the civil and military\r\ngovernment of that country shall be transferred to the Company under\r\nsuitable provisions for the Nawab and his family.'\r\n\r\nIn 1831 Lord William Bentinck warned the King of Oudh that, unless\r\nhe would consent to rule his territories in accordance with the\r\nprinciples of good government and the interest of the people, the East\r\nIndia Company would assume the entire administration of the province,\r\nand would make him a state prisoner.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 Lord Hardinge went in person to Lucknow and solemnly\r\nreiterated the warning, giving the King two years to reform his\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nIn 1851 Colonel Sleeman, the Resident at Lucknow, whose sympathy with\r\nthe Rulers of Native States was thought to be even too great, and\r\nwho was the last person to exaggerate the misrule existing in Oudh,\r\nreported to Lord Dalhousie that the state of things had become\r\nintolerable, and that, if our troops were withdrawn from Oudh, the\r\nlandholders would in one month's time overrun the province and pillage\r\nLucknow. It is true Sleeman, with his Native proclivities, did not\r\ncontemplate annexation; his advice was to 'assume the administration,'\r\nbut not to 'grasp the revenues of the country.' The same mode of\r\nprocedure had been advocated by Henry Lawrence six years before in an\r\narticle which appeared in the _Calcutta Review_. His words were: 'Let\r\nOudh be at last governed, not for one man, the King, but for the King\r\nand his people. Let the administration of the country be Native; let\r\nnot one rupee come into the Company's coffers.'\r\n\r\nSleeman was followed in 1854 by Colonel Outram, than whom he could\r\nnot have had a more admirable successor, or one less likely to be\r\nunnecessarily hard upon a State which, with all its shortcomings, had\r\nbeen loyal to us for nearly a century. Colonel Outram, nevertheless,\r\nfully endorsed the views of his predecessor. General Low, the then\r\nMilitary Member of Council, who twenty years before, when Resident\r\nat Lucknow, had deprecated our assuming even temporarily the\r\nadministration of Oudh, thinking our action would be misunderstood by\r\nthe people, now also stated his conviction that 'it was the paramount\r\nduty of the British Government to interfere at once for the protection\r\nof the people of Oudh.'\r\n\r\nIn summing up the case, Lord Dalhousie laid three possible courses of\r\naction before the authorities in England. The King of Oudh might be\r\nforced to abdicate, his province being incorporated in the British\r\ndominions; or he might be maintained in his royal state as a\r\nsubsidized Prince, the actual government being permanently transferred\r\nto the East India Company; or the transfer of the government to\r\nthe East India Company might be for a limited period only. The\r\nGovernor-General recommended the second course, but the Court of\r\nDirectors and Her Majesty's Ministers decided to adopt the first,\r\nand requested Lord Dalhousie to carry out the annexation before he\r\nresigned his office.\r\n\r\nThis measure, so long deferred and so carefully considered, could\r\nhardly, in my opinion, have been avoided by a civilized and civilizing\r\nGovernment. It was at last adopted with the utmost reluctance, and\r\nonly after the experiment of administering a province for the benefit\r\nof the Natives, without annexing it, had been tried in the Punjab\r\nand had signally failed. To use Lord Dalhousie's words, it was amply\r\njustified on the ground that 'the British Government would be guilty\r\nin the sight of God and man if it were any longer to aid in sustaining\r\nby its countenance an administration fraught with suffering to\r\nmillions.' But the Natives generally could not understand the\r\nnecessity for the measure, or believe in the reasons which influenced\r\nus; many of them, therefore, considered it an unprovoked usurpation,\r\nand each Ruler of a Native State imagined that his turn might come\r\nnext.\r\n\r\nThus, the annexation of Oudh in one sense augmented that weakness in\r\nour position as an eastern Power which, so to speak, had its source\r\nin our strength. So long as there was a balance of power\r\nbetween ourselves and Native States--Mahratta, Rajput, Sikh, or\r\nMahomedan--they were prevented by their mutual jealousies and\r\nreligious differences from combining against us; but when that balance\r\nwas destroyed and we became the paramount Power in India, the period\r\nof danger to us began, as was prophesied by the far-seeing Malcolm in\r\nthe early days of our first conquests. We had now become objects of\r\nsuspicion and dread to all the lesser Powers, who were ready to sink\r\ntheir own disputes in the consideration of the best means to check the\r\nextension of our rule and overthrow our supremacy; while we, inflated\r\nby our power and satisfied with our apparent security, became more\r\ndogmatic and uncompromising in enforcing principles which, though\r\nsound and just in themselves, were antipathetic to Native ideas and\r\ntraditions. By a great many acts and measures we made them feel how\r\ncompletely our ideas differed from theirs. They preferred their own,\r\nand strongly resented our increasing efforts to impose ours upon them.\r\nEven those amongst the Native Princes who were too enlightened to\r\nbelieve that we intended to force our religion upon them and change\r\nall their customs, felt that their power was now merely nominal, and\r\nthat every substantial attribute of sovereignty would soon disappear\r\nif our notions of progress continued to be enforced.\r\n\r\nAt a time when throughout the country there existed these feelings of\r\ndissatisfaction and restless suspicion, it was not to be expected that\r\nthe most discontented and unfriendly of the Native Rulers would not\r\nseize the opportunity to work us mischief. The most prominent of these\r\namongst the Mahomedans were the royal family of Delhi and the ex-King\r\nof Oudh, and, amongst the Hindus, Dundu Pant, better known by English\r\npeople as the 'Nana Sahib.'\r\n\r\nAll three considered themselves badly treated, and no doubt, from\r\ntheir point of view, their grievances were not altogether groundless.\r\nThe King of Oudh's I have already indicated, and when his province was\r\nannexed, he was removed to Calcutta. Having refused the yearly pension\r\nof twelve lakhs[2] of rupees offered to him, and declined to sign the\r\ntreaty by which his territory was made over to the British Government,\r\nhe sent his mother, his son, and his brother to England to plead his\r\ncause for him.\r\n\r\nThe most influential of the three discontented Rulers, or, at all\r\nevents, the one whom the rebellious of all castes and religions were\r\nmost inclined to put forward as their nominal leader, was the head of\r\nthe Delhi royal family, by name Bahadur Shah. He was eighty years old\r\nin 1857, and had been on the throne for twenty years. His particular\r\ngrievance lay in the fact of our decision that on his death the\r\ntitle of King, which we had bestowed on the successors of the Moghul\r\nEmperor, should be abolished, and his family removed from Delhi.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the century Lord Wellesley pointed out the danger\r\nof allowing a Mahomedan Prince, with all the surroundings of royalty,\r\nto remain at the seat of the old Moghul government, but the question\r\nwas allowed to remain in abeyance until 1849, when Lord Dalhousie\r\nreconsidered it, and obtained the sanction of the authorities in\r\nEngland to the removal of the Court from Delhi to a place about\r\nfourteen miles off, where the Kutub tower stands. At the same time the\r\nHeir Apparent was to be told that on his father's death the title of\r\nKing of Delhi would cease.\r\n\r\nLord Dalhousie had been only a short time in India when he took\r\nup this question, and he could not properly have appreciated the\r\nestimation in which the Natives held the King of Delhi, for he wrote\r\nin support of his proposals 'that the Princes of India and its people\r\nhad become entirely indifferent to the condition of the King or his\r\nposition.' But when the decision of the British Government on the\r\nsubject reached India, he had been more than two years in the country,\r\nand although his views as to the desirability of the measure remained\r\nunchanged, the experience he had gained enabled him to gauge more\r\naccurately the feelings of the people, and, with the advice of his\r\nCouncil, he came to the conclusion that it would be wiser to let\r\naffairs remain _in statu quo_ during Bahadur Shah's lifetime. The\r\nroyal family were informed accordingly, and an agreement was drawn up,\r\nsigned, sealed, and witnessed, by which the Heir Apparent accepted the\r\nconditions to be imposed upon him on the death of his father, who was\r\nto be allowed to remain in Delhi during his lifetime, with all the\r\nparaphernalia of royalty.\r\n\r\nHowever satisfactory this arrangement might be to the Government of\r\nIndia, to every member of the Delhi royal family it must have seemed\r\noppressive and humiliating to the last degree. Outwardly they appeared\r\nto accept the inevitable quietly and submissively, but they were only\r\nbiding their time, and longing for an opportunity to throw off the\r\nhated English yoke. The war with Persia in 1856 seemed to offer the\r\nchance they wanted. On the pretence that the independence of Herat\r\nwas threatened by the Amir of Kabul, the Persians marched an army to\r\nbesiege that place. As this act was a violation of our treaty with\r\nPersia made three years before, Her Majesty's Government directed that\r\nan army should be sent from India to the Persian Gulf. The troops had\r\nscarcely left Bombay before the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West\r\nProvinces was warned by a Native correspondent that the King of\r\nDelhi was intriguing with the Shah of Persia. At the same time a\r\nproclamation was posted on the walls of the Jama Masjid (Shah Jehan's\r\nfamous mosque at Delhi), to the effect that a Persian army was coming\r\nto relieve India from the presence of the English, and calling on all\r\ntrue believers to rise and fight against the heretics. Reports were\r\nalso diligently circulated of our being defeated on the shores of\r\nthe Persian Gulf, and the people were made to believe that their\r\nopportunity had arrived, and that the time was now favourable for a\r\nsuccessful rebellion.\r\n\r\nOf the three principal movers in the events which immediately preceded\r\nthe Mutiny, the Nana Sahib was by far the most intelligent, and had\r\nmixed most with Europeans. He was the adopted son and heir of the last\r\nof the Peshwas, the Chiefs of the Mahratta confederacy. His cause of\r\ndissatisfaction was the discontinuance to him of a pension which, at\r\nthe close of the Mahratta war in 1818, was granted to the Peshwa, on\r\nthe clear understanding that it was to cease at his death. The Peshwa\r\ndied in 1851, leaving the Nana an enormous fortune; but he was not\r\ncontent. The lapse of the pension, to which he was not entitled,\r\nrankled in his breast, and when all his efforts to get it restored\r\nto him proved of no avail, he became thoroughly disgusted and\r\ndisaffected. After failing to obtain in India a reconsideration of\r\nthe decision of the Government on the subject, he sent to England\r\nas confidential agent a Mahomedan of the name of Azimula Khan, who\r\nremained three years in Europe, residing for the most part in London;\r\nbut he also visited Paris, Constantinople, and the Crimea, arriving at\r\nthe latter place when we, in alliance with the French, were besieging\r\nSebastopol. He was a man of no rank or position in his own country, a\r\nmere agent of the Nana's, but he was received into the best English\r\nsociety, was everywhere treated as a royal Prince, and became engaged\r\nto a young English girl, who agreed to follow him to India to be\r\nmarried. All this was revealed by the correspondence to which I have\r\nreferred as having been found in the Nana's palace of Bithur. The\r\ngreater number of these letters were from people in England--not a few\r\nfrom ladies of rank and position. One elderly dame called him her dear\r\neastern son. There were numerous letters from his English _fiancée_,\r\nand two from a Frenchman of the name of Lafont,[3] relating to some\r\nbusiness with the French settlement of Chandernagore, with which he\r\nhad been entrusted by Azimula Khan, acting for the Nana. Written, as\r\nthese letters were, immediately before the Mutiny, in which the Nana\r\nwas the leading spirit, it seems probable that '_les principales\r\nchoses_,' to which Lafont hopes to bring satisfactory answers, were\r\ninvitations to the disaffected and disloyal in Calcutta, and perhaps\r\nthe French settlers at Chandernagore, to assist in the effort about to\r\nbe made to throw off the British yoke. A portion of the correspondence\r\nwas unopened, and there were several letters in Azimula's own\r\nhandwriting which had not been despatched. Two of these were to Omar\r\nPasha at Constantinople, and told of the sepoys' discontent and the\r\ntroubled state of India generally. That the Nana was intriguing with\r\nthe King of Delhi, the Nawab of Oudh, and other great personages, has\r\nbeen proved beyond a doubt, although at the time he was looked upon by\r\nthe British residents at Cawnpore as a perfectly harmless individual,\r\nin spite of its being known that he considered himself aggrieved on\r\naccount of his having been refused the continuance of the pension, and\r\nbecause a salute of guns (such as it is the custom to give to Native\r\nPrinces on entering British territory) had not been accorded to him.\r\n\r\nWhile the spirit of rebellion was thus being fostered and stirred into\r\nactive existence throughout the country, it was hardly to be hoped\r\nthat the Native army would be allowed to remain unaffected by a\r\nmovement which could not easily attain formidable proportions without\r\nthe assistance of the Native soldiers, who themselves, moreover, had\r\nnot remained unmoved spectators of all that had happened during the\r\nprevious thirty or forty years. The great majority of the sepoys were\r\ndrawn from the agricultural classes, especially in the province\r\nof Oudh, and were therefore directly interested in all questions\r\nconnected with rights of property, tenure of land, etc.; and questions\r\nof religion and caste affected them equally with the rest of the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nQuietly, but surely, the instigators of rebellion were preparing the\r\nNative army for revolt. The greatest cunning and circumspection were,\r\nhowever, necessary to success. There were so many opposing interests\r\nto be dealt with, Mahomedans and Hindus being as violently hostile to\r\neach other, with regard to religion and customs, as they were to us.\r\nSoldiers, too, of all ranks had a great stake in their profession.\r\nSome had nearly served their time for their pensions, that greatest\r\nof all attractions to the Native to enter the army, for the youngest\r\nrecruit feels that, if he serves long enough, he is sure of an income\r\nsufficient to enable him to sit in the sun and do nothing for the rest\r\nof his days--a Native's idea of supreme happiness. The enemies of our\r\nrule generally, and the fanatic in particular, were, however, equal\r\nto the occasion. They took advantage of the widespread discontent to\r\nestablish the belief that a systematic attack was to be made on the\r\nfaith and habits of the people, whether Hindu or Mahomedan, and, as a\r\nproof of the truth of their assertions, they alleged that the Enfield\r\ncartridges which had been recently issued to the army were greased\r\nwith a mixture of cows' fat and lard, the one being as obnoxious to\r\nthe Hindu as the other is to the Mahomedan. The news spread throughout\r\nthe Bengal Presidency; the sepoys became alarmed, and determined to\r\nsuffer any punishment rather than pollute themselves by biting the\r\ncontaminating cartridge, as their doing so would involve loss of\r\ncaste, which to the Hindu sepoy meant the loss of everything to him\r\nmost dear and sacred in this world and the next. He and his family\r\nwould become outcasts, his friends and relations would look on him\r\nwith horror and disgust, while eternal misery, he believed, would be\r\nhis doom in the world to come.\r\n\r\nIt has been made quite clear that a general belief existed amongst the\r\nHindustani sepoys that the destruction of their caste and religion had\r\nbeen finally resolved upon by the English, as a means of forcing them\r\nto become Christians, and it seems extraordinary that the English\r\nofficers with Native regiments were so little aware of the strength of\r\nthis impression amongst their men.\r\n\r\nThe recent researches of Mr. Forrest in the records of the Government\r\nof India prove that the lubricating mixture used in preparing the\r\ncartridges was actually composed of the objectionable ingredients,\r\ncows' fat and lard, and that incredible disregard of the soldiers'\r\nreligious prejudices was displayed in the manufacture of these\r\ncartridges. When the sepoys complained that to bite them would destroy\r\ntheir caste, they were solemnly assured by their officers that they\r\nhad been greased with a perfectly unobjectionable mixture. These\r\nofficers, understanding, as all who have come in contact with Natives\r\nare supposed to understand, their intense abhorrence of touching the\r\nflesh or fat of the sacred cow or the unclean pig, did not believe it\r\npossible that the authorities could have been so regardless of the\r\nsepoys' feelings as to have allowed it to be used in preparing their\r\nammunition: they therefore made this statement in perfect good faith.\r\nBut nothing was easier than for the men belonging to the regiments\r\nquartered near Calcutta to ascertain, from the low-caste Native\r\nworkmen employed in manufacturing the cartridges at the Fort William\r\narsenal, that the assurances of their officers were not in accordance\r\nwith facts, and they were thus prepared to credit the fables which the\r\nsedition-mongers so sedulously spread abroad, to the effect that the\r\nGovernment they served and the officers who commanded them had entered\r\ninto a deliberate conspiracy to undermine their religion.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all the evil influence brought to bear on the Native\r\narmy, I do not think that the sepoys would have proved such ready\r\ninstruments in the hands of the civilian intriguers, had that army\r\nbeen organized, disciplined, and officered in a satisfactory manner,\r\nand had there been a sufficient proportion of British troops in India\r\nat the time. To the great preponderance of Native, as compared with\r\nBritish, troops may be attributed the fact that the sepoys dared to\r\nbreak into open mutiny. Moreover, the belief of the Natives in the\r\ninvincibility of the British soldier, which formerly enabled small\r\nnumbers of Europeans to gain victories over large Native armies, had\r\nbeen seriously weakened by the lamentable occurrences at Kabul during\r\nthe first Afghan war, terminating in the disastrous retreat in the\r\nwinter of 1841-42.\r\n\r\nTo add to the exalted idea the sepoys were beginning to entertain of\r\ntheir own importance, they were pampered by their officers and the\r\ncivil Government to a most absurd extent, being treated under all\r\ncircumstances with far greater consideration than the European\r\nsoldiers. For instance, in the time of Lord William Bentinck flogging\r\nwas abolished in the Native army,[4] while still in full swing amongst\r\nBritish soldiers, and sepoys were actually allowed to witness the\r\nhumiliation of their white comrades when this degrading form of\r\npunishment was inflicted upon them.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of our connexion with India, we had no need for\r\nan army. Living, as we were, on sufferance in a foreign land for\r\ncommercial purposes, armed men were only required to guard the\r\nfactories. As these factories increased in size and importance, these\r\narmed men were given a semi-military organization, and in time they\r\nwere formed into levies as a reserve to the few Europeans entertained\r\nby the merchants, to enable them to hold their own against the French,\r\nwho were then beginning to dispute with us for supremacy in southern\r\nIndia. When employed in the field, the Native troops were associated\r\nwith a varying proportion of British soldiers, but the number of the\r\nlatter was limited by the expense of their maintenance, the difficulty\r\nof supplying them from England, and the unadvisability of locking up a\r\npart of the British army in distant stations, which at that time\r\nwere very inaccessible and generally unhealthy. Native troops were\r\ntherefore raised in continually increasing numbers, and after the\r\nbattle of Plassey the Native army was rapidly augmented, especially\r\nin the Bengal Presidency; and, trained and led as it was by British\r\nofficers, it achieved remarkable successes.\r\n\r\nDuring the thirteen years preceding the Mutiny, the Native army,\r\nnumbering 217,000 men and 176 guns, was increased by 40,000 men and 40\r\nguns, but no addition was made to the small British force of 38,000\r\nuntil 1853, when one regiment was added to each Presidency, or less\r\nthan 3,000 soldiers in all. This insignificant augmentation was\r\nsubsequently more than neutralized by the withdrawal of six British\r\nregiments from India to meet the requirements of the Crimean and\r\nPersian wars. Lord Dalhousie, Governor-General in 1854, saw the danger\r\nof this great preponderance of Native troops. He represented that the\r\nannexations and conquests which had taken place during his tenure of\r\noffice necessitated a proportional increase of British soldiers; he\r\nprotested against the withdrawal of a single European regiment, either\r\non account of the war with Russia or for operations in the Persian\r\nGulf, and he solemnly warned Her Majesty's Government that the\r\nessential element of our strength in India was the presence of a large\r\nnumber of British troops.\r\n\r\nNo attention, however, was paid to Lord Dalhousie's representations by\r\nthe authorities in England, who doubtless thought they understood the\r\nrequirements of India better than the Governor-General, with his\r\nmore than six years' experience of the country. In spite of his\r\nremonstrances, two regiments were ordered to England, and four were\r\nsent later to the Persian Gulf, with the result which I have already\r\nstated.\r\n\r\nWhen the Mutiny broke out, the whole effective British force in India\r\nonly amounted to 36,000 men, against 257,000 Native soldiers,[5] a\r\nfact which was not likely to be overlooked by those who hoped and\r\nstrived to gain to their own side this preponderance of numerical\r\nstrength, and which was calculated to inflate the minds of the sepoys\r\nwith a most undesirable sense of independence. An army of Asiatics,\r\nsuch as we maintain in India, is a faithful servant, but a treacherous\r\nmaster; powerfully influenced by social and religious prejudices with\r\nwhich we are imperfectly acquainted, it requires the most careful\r\nhandling; above all, it must never be allowed to lose faith in the\r\nprestige or supremacy of the governing race. When mercenaries feel\r\nthat they are indispensable to the maintenance of that authority which\r\nthey have no patriotic interest in upholding, they begin to consider\r\nwhether it would not be more to their advantage to aid in overthrowing\r\nthat authority, and if they decide that it would be, they have little\r\nscruple in transferring their allegiance from the Government they\r\nnever loved, and have ceased to fear, to the power more in accordance\r\nwith their own ideas, and from which, they are easily persuaded, they\r\nwill obtain unlimited benefits.\r\n\r\nA fruitful cause of dissatisfaction in our Native army, and one which\r\npressed more heavily upon it year by year, as our acquisitions of\r\nterritory in northern India became more extended, was the sepoy's\r\nliability to service in distant parts of India, entailing upon him a\r\nlife amongst strangers differing from him in religion and in all their\r\ncustoms, and far away from his home, his family, and his congenial\r\nsurroundings--a liability which he had never contemplated except in\r\nthe event of war, when extra pay, free rations and the possibility\r\nof loot, would go far to counterbalance the disadvantages of\r\nexpatriation. Service in Burma, which entailed crossing the sea, and,\r\nto the Hindu, consequent loss of caste, was especially distasteful. So\r\ngreat an objection, indeed, had the sepoys to this so-called 'foreign\r\nservice,' and so difficult did it become to find troops to relieve the\r\nregiments, in consequence of the bulk of the Bengal army not being\r\navailable for service beyond the sea, that the Court of Directors\r\nsanctioned Lord Canning's proposal that, after the 1st September,\r\n1856, 'no Native recruit shall be accepted who does not at the time of\r\nhis enlistment undertake to serve beyond the sea whether within\r\nthe territories of the Company or beyond them.' This order, though\r\nabsolutely necessary, caused the greatest dissatisfaction amongst\r\nthe Hindustani sepoys, who looked upon it as one of the measures\r\nintroduced by the _Sirkar_ for the forcible, or rather fraudulent,\r\nconversion of all the Natives to Christianity.[6]\r\n\r\nThat the long-existing discontent and growing disloyalty in our\r\nNative army might have been discovered sooner, and grappled with in a\r\nsufficiently prompt and determined manner to put a stop to the Mutiny,\r\nhad the senior regimental and staff officers been younger, more\r\nenergetic, and intelligent, is an opinion to which I have always been\r\nstrongly inclined. Their excessive age, due to a strict system of\r\npromotion by seniority which entailed the employment of Brigadiers of\r\nseventy, Colonels of sixty, and Captains of fifty, must necessarily\r\nhave prevented them performing their military duties with the energy\r\nand activity which are more the attributes of younger men, and must\r\nhave destroyed any enthusiasm about their regiments, in which there\r\nwas so little hope of advancement or of individual merit being\r\nrecognized. Officers who displayed any remarkable ability were allowed\r\nto be taken away from their own corps for the more attractive and\r\nbetter-paid appointments appertaining to civil employ or the Irregular\r\nservice. It was, therefore, the object of every ambitious and capable\r\nyoung officer to secure one of these appointments, and escape as soon\r\nas possible from a service in which ability and professional zeal\r\ncounted for nothing.[7]\r\n\r\nSo far as I understand the causes which led to the rebellion of 1857,\r\nI have now answered the question, 'What brought about the Mutiny?' The\r\nreply to the second question, 'Is there any chance of a similar rising\r\noccurring again?' must be left to another chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In this matter it seems to me that Lord Dalhousie's\r\npolicy has been unfairly criticized. The doctrine of lapse was no\r\nnew-fangled theory of the Governor-General, but had been recognized\r\nand acted upon for many years by the Native dynasties which preceded\r\nthe East India Company. Under the Company's rule the Court of\r\nDirectors had investigated the subject, and in a series of despatches\r\nfrom 1834 to 1846 had laid down that, in certain cases, the selection\r\nand adoption of an heir by a Native Ruler was an incontestable right,\r\nsubject only to the formal sanction of the suzerain Power, while in\r\nother cases such a procedure was optional, and could only be permitted\r\nas a special favour. Lord Dalhousie concurred in the view that each\r\ncase should be considered and decided on its merits. His words were:\r\n'The Government is bound in duty, as well as in policy, to act on\r\nevery such occasion with the purest integrity, and in the most\r\nscrupulous observance of good faith. Where even a shadow of doubt can\r\nbe shown, the claim should at once be abandoned. But where the right\r\nto territory by lapse is clear, the Government is bound to take that\r\nwhich is justly and legally its due, and to extend to that territory\r\nthe benefits of our sovereignty, present and prospective.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In those days £120,000.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3:\r\n\r\n    'Benares,\r\n    '_April 4, 1857._\r\n\r\n    'MON CHER AZIMULA KHAN,\r\n\r\n    'Je suis parti de Cawnpore le premier du mois et suis arrivé ici\r\n    ce matin, je partirai ce soir et serai à Chandernagore le 7 au\r\n    matin, dans la journée je ferai une visite au Gouverneur et\r\n    le lendemain irai à Calcutta, je verrai notre Consul General.\r\n    Ecrivez-moi et adressez-moi vos lettres, No. 123, Dhurumtollah.

He alluded\r\nespecially to the new order about enlistment, our object being, he\r\nsaid, to make the sepoys go across the sea in order that they might be\r\nobliged to eat what we liked; and he argued that, as we had made our\r\nway through India, had won Bhartpur, Lahore, etc., by fraud, so it\r\nmight be possible that we would mix bone-dust with grain sold to\r\nHindus. Sir Henry Lawrence was quite unable to convince the Native\r\nofficer; he would give us credit for nothing, and although he would\r\nnot say that he himself _did_ or did _not_ believe, he kept repeating,\r\n'I tell you Natives are all like sheep; the leading one tumbles, and\r\ndown all the rest roll over him.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: It is curious to note how nearly every military officer\r\nwho held a command or high position on the staff in Bengal when the\r\nMutiny broke out, disappeared from the scene within the first few\r\nweeks, and was never heard of officially again.

These great public works have largely\r\nincreased the area of land under cultivation, minimized the risk of\r\nfamine, equalized the prices of agricultural produce, and developed a\r\nlarge and lucrative export trade. Above all, while our troops can now\r\nbe assembled easily and rapidly at any centre of disturbance, the\r\nnumber of British soldiers has been more than doubled and the number\r\nof Native soldiers has been materially reduced. Moreover, as regards\r\nthe Native equally with the British army of India, I believe that\r\na better feeling never existed throughout all ranks than exists at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there are signs that the spirit of unrest and discontent\r\nwhich sowed the seeds of the Mutiny is being revived. To some extent\r\nthis state of things is the natural result of our position in\r\nIndia, and is so far unavoidable, but it is also due to old faults\r\nreappearing--faults which require to be carefully watched and guarded\r\nagainst, for it is certain that, however well disposed as soldiers the\r\nmen in our ranks may be, their attitude will inevitably be influenced\r\nby the feelings of the people generally, more especially should their\r\nhostility be aroused by any question connected with religion.\r\n\r\nFor a considerable time after the Mutiny we became more cautious and\r\nconciliatory in administrative and legislative matters, more intent\r\non doing what would keep the Chiefs and Rulers satisfied, the masses\r\ncontented, and the country quiet, than on carrying out our own ideas.\r\nGradually this wholesome caution is being disregarded. The Government\r\nhas become more and more centralized, and the departmental spirit\r\nvery strong. Each department, in its laudable wish for progress and\r\nadvancement, is apt to push on measures which are obnoxious to the\r\nNatives, either from their not being properly understood, or from\r\ntheir being opposed to their traditions and habits of life, thus\r\nentailing the sacrifice of many cherished customs and privileges. Each\r\ndepartment admits in theory the necessity for caution, but in practice\r\npresses for liberty of action to further its own particular schemes.\r\n\r\nOf late years, too, the tendency has been to increase the number of\r\ndepartments and of secretariat offices under the supreme Government,\r\nand this tendency, while causing more work to devolve on the supreme\r\nGovernment than it can efficiently perform, results in lessening\r\nthe responsibility of provincial Governments by interference in the\r\nmanagement of local concerns. It is obvious that in a country like\r\nIndia, composed as it is of great provinces and various races\r\ndiffering from one another in interests, customs, and religions, each\r\nwith its own peculiar and distinct necessities, administrative details\r\nought to be left to the people on the spot. The Government of India\r\nwould then be free to exercise a firm and impartial control over the\r\nEmpire and Imperial interests, while guiding into safe channels,\r\nwithout unduly restraining, intelligent progress.\r\n\r\nIn times of peace the administration is apt to fall too exclusively\r\ninto the hands of officials whose ability is of the doctrinaire type;\r\nthey work hard, and can give logical and statistical reasons for the\r\nmeasures they propose, and are thus able to make them attractive to,\r\nand believed in by, the authorities. But they lack the more perfect\r\nknowledge of human nature, and the deeper insight into, and greater\r\nsympathy with, the feelings and prejudices of Asiatics, which those\r\npossessed in a remarkable degree who proved by their success that they\r\nhad mastered the problem of the best form of government for India.\r\nI allude to men like Thomas Munro, Mountstuart Elphinstone, John\r\nMalcolm, Charles Metcalfe, George Clerk, Henry and John Lawrence,\r\nWilliam Sleeman, James Outram, Herbert Edwardes, John Nicholson, and\r\nmany others. These administrators, while fully recognizing the need\r\nfor a gradual reform, understood the peculiarities of our position\r\nin the east, the necessity for extreme caution and toleration, and a\r\n'live and let live' policy between us and the Natives. The sound and\r\nbroad views of this class of public servant are not always appreciated\r\neither in India or England, and are too often put aside as\r\nunpractical, obstructive, and old-fashioned.\r\n\r\nAmongst the causes which have produced discontent of late years,\r\nI would mention our forest laws and sanitary regulations, our\r\nlegislative and fiscal systems--measures so necessary that no\r\none interested in the prosperity of India could cavil at their\r\nintroduction, but which are so absolutely foreign to Native ideas,\r\nthat it is essential they should be applied with the utmost gentleness\r\nand circumspection.\r\n\r\nI think, also, that the official idea of converting the young Princes\r\nand Nobles of India into English gentlemen by means of English tutors\r\nand English studies should be carried out with great care and caution.\r\nIt has not hitherto invariably succeeded, and the feeling in many\r\nStates is strongly opposed to it. The danger of failure lies in the\r\nwholesome restraint of the tutor being suddenly removed, and in the\r\nyoung Prince being left at too early an age to select his advisers and\r\ncompanions. The former, perhaps not unnaturally, are interested\r\nin proving that the training of their young Ruler by his European\r\ngovernor or tutor has not resulted in good either to himself or his\r\npeople, while the latter are too often of the lowest class of European\r\nadventurers.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings and regulations of the Forest Department, desirable\r\nas they may be from a financial and agricultural point of view, have\r\nprovoked very great irritation in many parts of India. People who have\r\nbeen accustomed from time immemorial to pick up sticks and graze their\r\ncattle on forest lands, cannot understand why they should now be\r\nforbidden to do so, nor can they realize the necessity for preserving\r\nthe trees from the chance of being destroyed by fire, a risk to which\r\nthey were frequently exposed from the Native custom of making use of\r\ntheir shelter while cooking, and of burning the undergrowth to enrich\r\nthe grazing.\r\n\r\nThe action taken by the Government in sanitary matters has also\r\naroused much ill-feeling and apprehension. Sanitary precautions are\r\nentirely ignored in eastern countries. The great majority of the\r\npeople can see no good in them, and no harm in using the same tank\r\nfor drinking purposes and for bathing and washing their clothes. The\r\nimmediate surroundings of their towns and villages are most offensive,\r\nbeing used as the general receptacles for dead animals and all kinds\r\nof filth. Cholera, fever, and other diseases, which carry off hundreds\r\nof thousands every year, are looked upon as the visitation of God,\r\nfrom which it is impossible, even were it not impious to try, to\r\nescape; and the precautionary measures insisted upon by us in our\r\ncantonments, and at the fairs and places of pilgrimage, are viewed\r\nwith aversion and indignation. Only those who have witnessed the\r\npersonal discomfort and fatigue to which Natives of all ages and both\r\nsexes willingly submit in their struggle to reach some holy shrine on\r\nthe occasion of a religious festival, while dragging their weary limbs\r\nfor many hundreds of miles along a hot, dusty road, or being huddled\r\nfor hours together in a crammed and stifling railway carriage, can\r\nhave any idea of the bitter disappointment to the pilgrims caused\r\nby their being ordered to disperse when cholera breaks out at such\r\ngatherings, without being given the opportunity of performing their\r\nvows or bathing in the sacred waters.[1]\r\n\r\nFurther, our legislative system is based on western ideas, its object\r\nbeing to mete out equal justice to the rich and poor, to the Prince\r\nand peasant. But our methods of procedure do not commend themselves\r\nto the Indian peoples. Eastern races are accustomed to a paternal\r\ndespotism, and they conceive it to be the proper function of the local\r\nrepresentatives of the supreme Power to investigate and determine on\r\nthe spot the various criminal and civil cases which come under the\r\ncognizance of the district officials. Legal technicalities and\r\nreferences to distant tribunals confuse and harass a population which,\r\nwith comparatively few exceptions, is illiterate, credulous, and\r\nsuspicious of underhand influence. An almost unlimited right of\r\nappeal from one court to another, in matters of even the most trivial\r\nimportance, not only tends to impair the authority of the local\r\nmagistrate, but gives an unfair advantage to the wealthy litigant\r\nwhose means enable him to secure the services of the ablest pleader,\r\nand to purchase the most conclusive evidence in support of his claims.\r\nFor it must be remembered than in India evidence on almost any subject\r\ncan be had for the buying, and the difficulty, in the administration\r\nof justice, of discriminating between truth and falsehood is thereby\r\ngreatly increased. Under our system a horde of unscrupulous pleaders\r\nhas sprung up, and these men encourage useless litigation, thereby\r\nimpoverishing their clients, and creating much ill-feeling against our\r\nlaws and administration.\r\n\r\nAnother point worthy of consideration is the extent to which, under\r\nthe protection of our legal system, the peasant proprietors of\r\nIndia are being oppressed and ruined by village shop-keepers and\r\nmoney-lenders. These men advance money at a most exorbitant rate of\r\ninterest, taking as security the crops and occupancy rights of the\r\ncultivators of the soil. The latter are ignorant, improvident, and\r\nin some matters, such as the marriage ceremonies of their families,\r\ninordinately extravagant. The result is that a small debt soon swells\r\ninto a big one, and eventually the aid of the law courts is invoked to\r\noust the cultivator from a holding which, in many cases, has been\r\nin the possession of his ancestors for hundreds of years. The\r\nmoney-lender has his accounts to produce, and these can hardly be\r\ndisputed, the debtor as a rule being unable to keep accounts of his\r\nown, or, indeed, to read or write. Before the British dominion\r\nwas established in India, the usurer no doubt existed, but his\r\nopportunities were fewer, his position more precarious, and his\r\noperations more under control than they are at present. The\r\nmoney-lender then knew that his life would not be safe if he exacted\r\ntoo high interest for the loans with which he accommodated his\r\ncustomers, and that if he became too rich, some charge or other would\r\nbe trumped up against him, which would force him to surrender a large\r\nshare of his wealth to the officials of the State in which he was\r\nliving. I do not say that the rough-and-ready methods of Native\r\njustice in dealing with money-lenders were excusable or tolerable, but\r\nat the same time I am inclined to think that, in granting these men\r\nevery legal facility for enforcing their demands and carrying on their\r\ntraffic, we may have neglected the interests of the agriculturists,\r\nand that it might be desirable to establish some agency under the\r\ncontrol of Government, which would enable the poorer landholders to\r\nobtain, at a moderate rate of interest, advances proportionate to the\r\nsecurity they had to offer.[2]\r\n\r\nAnother danger to our supremacy in India is the license allowed to\r\nthe Native press in vilifying the Government and its officials, and\r\npersistently misrepresenting the motives and policy of the ruling\r\nPower. In a free country, where the mass of the population is well\r\neducated, independent, and self-reliant, a free press is a most\r\nvaluable institution, representing as it does the requirements and\r\naspirations of important sections of the community, and bringing to\r\nlight defects and abuses in the social and political system. In a\r\ncountry such as Great Britain, which is well advanced in the art of\r\nself-government, intolerant and indiscriminate abuse of public men\r\ndefeats its own object, and misstatements of matters of fact can be\r\nat once exposed and refuted. Like most of the developments of\r\ncivilization which are worth anything, the English press is a plant\r\nof indigenous growth, whereas in India the Native press is an exotic\r\nwhich, under existing conditions, supplies no general want, does\r\nnothing to refine, elevate, or instruct the people, and is used by its\r\nsupporters and promoters--an infinitesimal part of the population--as\r\na means of gaining its selfish ends, and of fostering sedition, and\r\nracial and religious animosities. There are, I am afraid, very few\r\nNative newspapers actuated by a friendly or impartial spirit towards\r\nthe Government of India, and to Asiatics it seems incredible that we\r\nshould permit such hostile publications to be scattered broadcast over\r\nthe country, unless the assertions were too true to be disputed, or\r\nunless we were too weak to suppress them. We gain neither credit nor\r\ngratitude for our tolerant attitude towards the Native press--our\r\nforbearance is misunderstood; and while the well-disposed are\r\namazed at our inaction, the disaffected rejoice at being allowed to\r\npromulgate baseless insinuations and misstatements which undermine our\r\nauthority, and thwart our efforts to gain the goodwill and confidence\r\nof the Native population.\r\n\r\nYet another danger to the permanence of our rule in India lies in the\r\nendeavours of well-intentioned faddists to regulate the customs and\r\ninstitutions of eastern races in accordance with their own ideas.\r\nThe United Kingdom is a highly civilized country, and our habits and\r\nconvictions have been gradually developed under the influences of our\r\nreligion and our national surroundings. Fortunately for themselves,\r\nthe people of Great Britain possess qualities which have made them\r\nmasters of a vast and still expanding Empire. But these qualities have\r\ntheir defects as well as their merits, and one of the defects is a\r\ncertain insularity of thought, or narrow-mindedness--a slowness to\r\nrecognize that institutions which are perfectly suitable and right for\r\nus may be quite unsuited, if not injurious, to other races, and that\r\nwhat may not be right for us to do is not necessarily wrong for people\r\nof a different belief, and with absolutely different traditions and\r\ncustoms.\r\n\r\nGradually the form of Government in the United Kingdom has become\r\nrepresentative and democratic, and it is therefore assumed by some\r\npeople, who have little, if any, experience of the east, that\r\nthe Government of India should be guided by the utterances of\r\nself-appointed agitators who pose as the mouth-pieces of an oppressed\r\npopulation. Some of these men are almost as much aliens[3] as\r\nourselves, while others are representatives of a class which, though\r\nintellectually advanced, has no influence amongst the races in whom\r\nlies the real strength of India. Municipal self-government has been\r\nfound to answer well in the United Kingdom, and it is held, therefore,\r\nthat a similar system must be equally successful in India. We in\r\nEngland consume animal food and alcoholic liquors, but have no liking\r\nfor opium; an effort has accordingly been made to deprive our Asiatic\r\nfellow-subjects, who, as a rule, are vegetarians, and either total\r\nabstainers or singularly abstemious in the matter of drink, of a small\r\nand inexpensive stimulant, which they find necessary to their health\r\nand comfort. British institutions and ideas are the embodiment of\r\nwhat long experience has proved to us to be best for ourselves; but\r\nsuddenly to establish these institutions and enforce these ideas on\r\na community which is not prepared for them, does not want them, and\r\ncannot understand them, must only lead to suspicion and discontent.\r\nThe Government of India should, no doubt, be progressive in its\r\npolicy, and in all things be guided by the immutable principles of\r\nright, truth, and justice; but these principles ought to be applied,\r\nnot necessarily as we should apply them in England, but with due\r\nregard to the social peculiarities and religious prejudices of the\r\npeople whom it ought to be our aim to make better and happier.\r\n\r\nIt will be gathered from what I have written that our administration,\r\nin my opinion, suffers from two main defects. First, it is internally\r\ntoo bureaucratic and centralizing in its tendencies; and, secondly, it\r\nis liable to be forced by the external pressure of well-meaning but\r\nirresponsible politicians and philanthropists to adopt measures which\r\nmay be disapproved of by the authorities on the spot, and opposed to\r\nthe wishes, requirements, and interests of the people. It seems to me\r\nthat for many years to come the best form of government for India will\r\nbe the intelligent and benevolent despotism which at present rules the\r\ncountry. On a small scale, and in matters of secondary importance,\r\nrepresentative institutions cannot perhaps do much harm, though I am\r\nafraid they will effect but little good. On a large scale, however,\r\nsuch a system of government would be quite out of place in view of\r\nthe fact that ninety-nine out of every hundred of the population are\r\nabsolutely devoid of any idea of civil responsibility, and that the\r\nvarious races and religious sects possess no bond of national union.\r\n\r\nIn reply, then, to the question, 'Is there any chance of a Mutiny\r\noccurring again?' I would say that the best way of guarding against\r\nsuch a calamity is--\r\n\r\n    By never allowing the present proportion of British to Native\r\n    soldiers to be diminished or the discipline and efficiency of the\r\n    Native army to become slack.\r\n\r\n    By taking care that men are selected for the higher civil and\r\n    military posts whose self-reliance, activity, and resolution are\r\n    not impaired by age, and who possess a knowledge of the country\r\n    and the habits of the peoples.\r\n\r\n    By recognizing and guarding against the dogmatism of theorists and\r\n    the dangers of centralization.\r\n\r\n    By rendering our administration on the one hand firm and strong,\r\n    on the other hand tolerant and sympathetic; and last, but not\r\n    least, by doing all in our power to gain the confidence of the\r\n    various races, and by convincing them that we have not only the\r\n    determination, but the ability to maintain our supremacy in India\r\n    against all assailants.\r\n\r\nIf these cardinal points are never lost sight of, there is, I believe,\r\nlittle chance of any fresh outbreak disturbing the stability of our\r\nrule in India, or neutralizing our efforts to render that country\r\nprosperous, contented, and thoroughly loyal to the British Crown.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Few acts have been more keenly resented than the closing\r\nof the great Hurdwar Fair in the autumn of 1892, on account of a\r\nserious outbreak of cholera. It was looked upon by the Natives as a\r\ndirect blow aimed at their religion, and as a distinct departure from\r\nthe religious tolerance promised in Her Majesty's proclamation of\r\n1858. The mysterious mud marks on mango-trees in Behar have been\r\nattributed by some to a self-interested motive on the part of certain\r\npriests to draw the attention of Hindus to the sanctity of some temple\r\noutside the limits of British jurisdiction, where the devotees would\r\nbe at liberty to assemble in any numbers without being troubled by\r\nofficious inspectors, and where they could remain as long as they\r\npleased, irrespective of the victims daily claimed by cholera, that\r\nunfailing avenger of the neglect of sanitary laws in the east.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The proposal would seem to be quite a practical one, for\r\nI read in the _Times_ of the 28th November, 1894, that the Government\r\nof New Zealand invited applications for Consols in connexion with the\r\nscheme for granting loans at a reasonable rate of interest to farmers\r\non the security of their holdings.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: I allude to the Parsis, who came from Persia, and whose\r\nreligion and customs are as distinct from those of the Natives of\r\nIndia as are our own.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n1858-1859\r\n\r\n  Home again--Back in India--Allahabad and Cawnpore\r\n  --The Viceroy's camp--State entry into Lucknow\r\n  --The Talukdars of Oudh--Loyalty of the Talukdars\r\n  --Cawnpore and Fatehgarh--The Agra Durbar\r\n\r\n\r\nI travelled home _viâ_ Corfu, Trieste, Venice, and Switzerland,\r\narriving in England towards the end of June. The intense delight\r\nof getting 'home' after one's first term of exile can hardly be\r\nexaggerated, and certainly cannot be realized, save by those who have\r\ngone through the exile, and been separated, as I had been for years,\r\nfrom all that made the happiness of my early life. Every English tree\r\nand flower one comes across on first landing is a distinct and lively\r\npleasure, while the greenness and freshness are a delicious rest to\r\nthe eye, wearied with the deadly whitey-brown sameness of dried-up\r\nsandy plains, or the all-too gorgeous colouring of eastern cities and\r\npageants.\r\n\r\nMy people were living in Ireland, in the county of Waterford, so after\r\nonly a short sojourn in London, for the very necessary re-equipment\r\nof the outer man, I hastened over there. I found my father well\r\nand strong for a man of seventy-four, and to all appearance quite\r\nrecovered from the effects of his fifty years of Indian service, and,\r\nto my great joy, my mother was looking almost as young, and quite as\r\nbeautiful, as I had left her six years before. My little sister, too,\r\nalways an invalid, was very much as when I had parted from her--full\r\nof loving-kindness for everyone, and, though unable to move without\r\nhelp, perfectly happy in the many resources she had within herself,\r\nand the good she was able to do in devoting those resources to the\r\nbenefit of others.\r\n\r\nThere, too, I found my fate, in the shape of Nora Bews, a young lady\r\nliving with a married sister not far from my father's place, who a\r\nfew months later consented to accompany me on my return to India. The\r\ngreater part of my leave was, therefore, spent in Ireland.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter months I hunted with the Curraghmore hounds, and was\r\nout with them the day before Lord Waterford was killed. We had no run,\r\nand at the end of the day, when wishing us good-bye, he said: 'I hope,\r\ngentlemen, we shall have better luck next time.' 'Next time' there was\r\n'better luck' as regarded the hunting, but the worst of all possible\r\nluck for Lord Waterford's numerous friends; in returning home after a\r\ngood run, and having killed two foxes, his horse stumbled over quite\r\na small ditch, throwing his rider on his head; the spinal cord was\r\nsnapped and the fine sportsman breathed his last in a few moments.\r\n\r\nI was married on the 17th May, 1859, in the parish church of\r\nWaterford. While on our wedding tour in Scotland, I received a command\r\nto be present on the 8th June at Buckingham Palace, when the Queen\r\nproposed to honour the recipients of the Victoria Cross by presenting\r\nthe decoration with Her Majesty's own hands.\r\n\r\nBeing anxious that my wife should be spared the great heat of a\r\njourney to India in July, the hottest month of the year in the Red\r\nSea, and the doctors being very decided in their opinion that I should\r\nnot return so soon, I had applied for a three months' extension of\r\nleave, and quite calculated on getting it, so our disappointment\r\nwas great when the answer arrived and I found that, if I took the\r\nextension, I should lose my appointment in the Quartermaster-General's\r\nDepartment. This, we agreed, was not to be thought of, so there was\r\nnothing for it but to face the disagreeable necessity as cheerfully\r\nas we could. We made a dash over to Ireland, said good-bye to our\r\nrelations, and started for India on the 27th June.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LADY ROBERTS\r\n(WIFE OF SIR ABRAHAM ROBERTS).\r\n_From a sketch by Carpenter._]\r\n\r\nThe heat in the Red Sea proved even worse than I had anticipated. Our\r\ncaptain pronounced it the hottest trip he had ever made. Twice was the\r\nship turned round to steam against the wind for a short time in order\r\nto revive some of the passengers, who were almost suffocated.\r\n\r\nWe passed the wreck of the _Alma_, a P. and O. vessel which had struck\r\non a coral reef not far from Mocha. The wreck had happened in the dead\r\nof night, and there had been only time to get the passengers into the\r\nboats, in which they were rowed to another reef near at hand; there\r\nthey had remained for eighty hours in their scanty night garments, and\r\nwithout the smallest shelter, until rescued by a friendly steamer. The\r\nofficers and crew were still on the rock when we passed, endeavouring\r\nto get up the mails and the passengers' property. We supplied them\r\nwith provisions and water, of which they were badly in need, and then\r\nhad to leave them in their extremely uncomfortable position.\r\n\r\nWe could not complain of lack of air after we passed Aden, for we\r\nforthwith encountered the south-west monsoon, then at its height, and\r\non entering the Bay of Bengal we experienced something very nearly\r\nakin to a cyclone. We broke our rudder; the lightships, on which a\r\ncertain number of pilots were always to be found, had all been blown\r\nout to sea; and as we had only just sufficient coal to take us up the\r\nHugli when the pilot should appear, we did not dare to keep up steam.\r\nThus we had to remain at the mercy of the winds and waves for some\r\ndays, until at length a brig with a pilot on board was sent to look\r\nfor us, and eventually we arrived in Calcutta, in rather a dilapidated\r\ncondition, on the 30th July.\r\n\r\nWe were not cheered by the orders I found awaiting me, which were to\r\nproceed to Morar and join Brigadier-General Sir Robert Napier, then in\r\ncommand of the Gwalior district. Morar in the month of August is one\r\nof the hottest places in India, and my wife was considerably the worse\r\nfor our experiences at sea. However, a Calcutta hotel never has many\r\nattractions, and at that time of year was depressing and uncomfortable\r\nto the last degree; in addition, I had rather a severe attack of my\r\nold enemy, Peshawar fever, so we started on our journey 'up country'\r\nwith as little delay as possible.\r\n\r\nThe railway at that time was not open further than Raniganj; thence we\r\nproceeded for a hundred miles in a 'dâk-ghari,' when, changing into\r\ndoolies, we continued our journey to Hazaribagh, a little cantonment\r\nabout twenty miles off the main road, where some relations of mine\r\nwere living; but a day or two after our arrival at their hospitable\r\nhouse, I was ordered back to Calcutta.\r\n\r\nI left my wife with our kind friends, and retraced my steps in\r\nconsiderable elation of spirits, for the China expedition was even\r\nthen being talked about, and I hoped this sudden summons might\r\npossibly mean that I was to be sent with it in some capacity. On\r\nreaching Calcutta, however, I was told that I had been appointed\r\nto organize and take charge of the large camp to be formed for the\r\ntriumphal progress which Lord Canning proposed to make through Oudh,\r\nthe North-West Provinces, and the Punjab, with the view of meeting\r\nthe principal feudatory Chiefs, and rewarding those who had been\r\nespecially loyal during the rebellion. I was informed that the tents\r\nwere in store in the arsenal at Allahabad, and that the camp must be\r\nready at Cawnpore on the 15th October, on which date the Viceroy would\r\narrive, and a day or two later commence his stately procession towards\r\nLucknow.\r\n\r\nWhile I was in England a Royal Proclamation had announced to the\r\npeople of India that the Queen had taken over the government of their\r\ncountry, which had hitherto been held in trust for Her Majesty by the\r\nHonourable East India Company. This fact had been publicly proclaimed,\r\nwith befitting ceremony, throughout the length and breadth of the\r\nland, on the 1st November, 1858. At the same time it was announced\r\nthat Her Majesty's representative in India was henceforth to be styled\r\nViceroy and Governor-General of India, and it was with the object of\r\nemphasizing this Proclamation, and impressing the Native mind with the\r\nreality of Queen Victoria's power and authority, that Lord Canning\r\ndecided on undertaking this grand tour.\r\n\r\nWhile in Calcutta on this occasion, I was offered a post in the\r\nRevenue Survey Department. I refused it, for, although as a married\r\nman the higher pay was a tempting bait, the recollection of the\r\nexcitement and variety of the year of the Mutiny was still fresh upon\r\nme, and I had no wish to leave the Quartermaster-General's Department.\r\nI therefore started for Allahabad, picking up my wife _en route_.\r\n\r\nIt was then the middle of the rains, and the bridge of boats over\r\nthe Jumna had been taken down, so we had to cross in ferry-boats--\r\ndâk-gharis, horses, and all--rather a perilous-looking proceeding,\r\nfor the river was running at a tremendous pace, and there was some\r\ndifficulty in keeping the boat's head straight. At Allahabad we\r\nstayed with a brother officer of mine in the fort, while I was\r\ngetting the camp equipage out of store, and the tents pitched for\r\ninspection. There had not been a large camp for many years, and\r\neverything in India deteriorates so rapidly, that I found most of the\r\ntents in such a state of mildew and decay as to render it necessary\r\nto renew them almost entirely before they could be used for such a\r\nsplendid occasion as that of the first Viceroy's first march through\r\nthe re-conquered country.\r\n\r\nFrom Allahabad we proceeded to Cawnpore, where I had a busy time\r\narranging for the multifarious requirements of such an enormous camp;\r\nand sometimes I despaired of its being completed by the appointed\r\ndate. However, completed it was; and on the 15th October Lord and Lady\r\nCanning arrived, and expressed themselves so pleased with all the\r\narrangements, and were so kindly appreciative of the exertions I had\r\nmade to be ready for them by the appointed time, that I felt myself\r\nfully rewarded for all my trouble.\r\n\r\nThe next day I took my wife to call upon Lady Canning, whose\r\nunaffected and simple, yet perfectly dignified manner completely\r\ncharmed her, and from that day she was devoted, in common with\r\neveryone who was at all intimately associated with Lady Canning, to\r\nthe gentle, gracious lady, who was always kindness itself to her.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th the Viceroy made his first march towards Lucknow. The camp\r\nequipage was in duplicate, so that everyone on arriving at the new\r\nhalting-place found things exactly the same as in the tents they had\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nThe camp occupied a considerable space; for, in addition to the\r\nViceroy's large _entourage_, ground had to be provided for the\r\nCommander-in-Chief and the officers of Army Head-Quarters, who\r\nwere marching with us; then there were the post-office, telegraph,\r\nworkshops, _toshikhana_,[1] commissariat, and a host of other offices\r\nto be accommodated, beside the escort, which consisted of a battery of\r\nHorse Artillery, a squadron of British Cavalry, a regiment of British\r\nInfantry, a regiment of Native Cavalry, a regiment of Native Infantry,\r\nand the Viceroy's Bodyguard. For the Viceroy, his staff, guests, and\r\nsecretaries alone, 150 large tents were pitched in the main street,\r\nand when we came to a station the duplicate tents were also pitched.\r\nFor the transport of this portion of the camp equipage 80 elephants\r\nand 500 camels were required.[2]\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to give any idea of the extraordinary spectacle a\r\nbig camp like this presents on the line of march. The followers, as a\r\nrule, are accompanied by their wives and families, who are piled upon\r\nthe summits of laden carts, or perched on the loads borne by the\r\nbaggage animals. In the two camps marching together (Lord Canning's\r\nand Lord Clyde's) there could not have been less than 20,000\r\nmen, women, and children--a motley crowd streaming along about\r\nfour-and-twenty miles of road, for the day's march was usually about\r\ntwelve miles, and before every one had cleared out of the camp\r\noccupied the night before, the advance guard had begun to arrive on\r\nthe ground to be occupied the next day. The strictest discipline had\r\nto be maintained, or this moving colony would have been a serious\r\ncalamity to the peasantry, for the followers would have spread\r\nthemselves over the country like a flight of locusts, and taken\r\nanything they could lay their hands on, representing themselves\r\nas _Mulk-i-Lord-Sahib-Ke-Naukar_,[3] whom according to immemorial\r\ntradition it was death to resist. The poor, frightened country-people,\r\ntherefore, hardly ventured to remonstrate at the _mahouts_ walking off\r\nwith great loads of their sugar-cane, or to object to the compulsory\r\npurchase of their farm produce for half its value. There was a great\r\ndeal of this kind of raiding at the commencement of the march, and\r\nI was constantly having complaints made to me by the villagers; but\r\nafter I had inflicted on the offenders a few summary and tolerably\r\nsevere punishments, and made the peasants to understand it was not the\r\n_Mulk-i-Lord-Sahib's_ wish that they should submit to such treatment\r\nfrom his servants, order was established, and I had very rarely any\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nOur first halt was at Lucknow. Sir Hope Grant was commanding the\r\ndivision, and had established himself very comfortably in the\r\nDilkusha. He had written asking me to bring my wife straight there and\r\nstay with him during the Viceroy's visit, as it was still very hot in\r\ntents during the day. An invitation which I gladly accepted, for it\r\nwas pleasant to think of being with my old General again, and I wanted\r\nto introduce him to my wife.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the 22nd October, the state entry was made into Lucknow.\r\nIt must have been an imposing sight, that long array of troops\r\nand guns, with Lord Canning in the centre, accompanied by the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, and surrounded by their respective staffs in full\r\nuniform. Lord Canning, though at that time not given to riding, looked\r\nremarkably well on horseback; for he had a fine head and shoulders,\r\nand sat his horse well; on foot, his height, not being quite in\r\nproportion, rather detracted from the dignity of his presence.\r\n\r\nI headed the procession, leading it across the Charbagh bridge, the\r\nscene of Havelock's fiercest encounter, past the Machi Bhawan, and the\r\nResidency, to the Kaisarbagh, in front of which were drawn up in a\r\nbody the Talukdars of Oudh, who had with difficulty been persuaded\r\nto come and make their obeisance, for, guiltily conscious of their\r\ndisloyalty during the rebellion, they did not feel at all sure that\r\nthe rumours that it was intended to blow them all away from guns, or\r\nto otherwise summarily dispose of them, were not true. They salaamed\r\nrespectfully as the Viceroy passed, and the cavalcade proceeded to the\r\nMartinière park, where the camp, which I had pitched the previous day,\r\nlay spread before us, in all the spotless purity of new white tents\r\nglistening in a flood of brilliant sunshine. The streets through which\r\nwe passed were crowded with Natives, who--cowed, but not tamed--looked\r\non in sullen defiance, very few showing any sign of respect for the\r\nViceroy.\r\n\r\nSir William and Lady Mansfield, and several other people from our camp\r\nwere also staying with Sir Hope Grant, and that evening the whole\r\nDilkusha party went to a state dinner given by Lord and Lady Canning.\r\nThe latter was a delightful hostess; the shyest person was set at ease\r\nby her kindly, sympathetic manner, and she had the happy knack of\r\nmaking her guests feel that her entertainments were a pleasure to\r\nherself--the surest way of rendering them enjoyable to those she\r\nentertained.\r\n\r\nI made use of the next week, which was for me a comparatively idle\r\ntime, to take my wife over the ground by which we had advanced two\r\nyears before, and explain to her the different positions held by the\r\nenemy. She was intensely interested in visiting the Sikandarbagh, the\r\nShah Najaf, the mess-house, and, above all, that glorious memorial\r\nof almost superhuman courage and endurance, the Residency, ruined,\r\nroofless, and riddled by round shot and bullets. Very little had then\r\nbeen done towards opening out the city, and the surroundings of the\r\nResidency were much as they had been during the defence--a labyrinth\r\nof streets and lanes; it was therefore easier for the stranger to\r\nrealize exactly what had taken place than it is now that the landmarks\r\nhave been cleared away, and well-laid-out gardens and broad roads have\r\ntaken the place of jungle and narrow alleys.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th the Viceroy held a grand durbar for the reception of the\r\nTalukdars. It was the first function of the sort I had witnessed, and\r\nwas an amusing novelty to my wife, who, with Lady Canning and some\r\nof the other ladies in camp, viewed the proceedings from behind a\r\nsemi-transparent screen, it not being considered at that time the\r\nthing for ladies to appear at ceremonials when Natives were present.\r\nThe whole scene was very impressive, though not as brilliant in\r\ncolouring as it would have been in any other part of India, owing\r\nto the Chiefs of Oudh being clad in simple white, as is the custom\r\namongst Rajputs.\r\n\r\nThe Talukdars, to the number of one hundred and sixty, were ushered to\r\ntheir places in strict order of seniority, the highest in rank being\r\nthe last to arrive. They were arranged in a half semicircle on the\r\nright of the Viceroy's chair of state, while on the left the Europeans\r\nwere seated according to their official rank. When all was ready, the\r\nwords 'Attention! Royal salute! Present arms!' were heard without,\r\nwarning those within of the Viceroy's approach, and, as the bugles\r\nsounded and the guns thundered forth their welcome, Lord Canning,\r\naccompanied by the Commander-in-Chief, and preceded by their staffs,\r\nentered the tent.\r\n\r\nEveryone rose, and remained standing until the great man took his\r\nseat, when the Foreign Secretary came forward, and, making a low bow,\r\ninformed His Excellency that all who had been summoned to attend the\r\ndurbar were present. The Chiefs were then brought up and introduced\r\nto the Viceroy one by one; each made a profound obeisance, and, as\r\na token of allegiance, presented an offering of gold mohurs,\r\nwhich, according to etiquette, the Viceroy just touched by way of\r\nacknowledgment. The presents from the Government to the Chiefs were\r\nthen handed in on trays, and placed on the ground in front of each,\r\nthe value of the present being regulated according to the rank and\r\nposition of the recipient. This part of the ceremony being over, the\r\nViceroy rose and addressed the Talukdars.\r\n\r\nAfter expressing his pleasure at meeting them in their own country, he\r\ngave them an assurance that, so long as they remained faithful to the\r\nGovernment, they should receive every consideration; he told them that\r\na new era had commenced in Oudh, and that henceforth they would be\r\nallowed to revert to the conditions under which they had held their\r\nestates prior to the annexation of the province. When Lord Canning had\r\nfinished speaking, a translation of his address in Urdu was read\r\nto the Talukdars by Mr. Beadon, the Foreign Secretary; _atar_ and\r\n_pan_[4] were then handed round, and the Viceroy took his departure\r\nwith the same formalities as those with which the durbar had been\r\nopened.\r\n\r\nThere is some excuse to be made for the attitude of the Talukdars,\r\nwho, from their point of view, had little reason to be grateful to the\r\nBritish Government. These powerful Chiefs, whose individual revenues\r\nvaried from £10,000 to £15,000 a year, and who, in their jungle\r\nfastnesses, often defied their sovereign's troops, had suddenly been\r\ndeprived of all the authority which in the confusion attending a long\r\nperiod of misgovernment they had gradually usurped, as well as of a\r\nconsiderable proportion of the landed property which, from time to\r\ntime, they had forcibly appropriated. The conversion of feudal Chiefs\r\ninto ordinary law-abiding subjects is a process which, however\r\nbeneficial to the many, is certain to be strenuously resisted by the\r\nfew.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1858, when Lucknow was captured, a Proclamation was issued\r\nby the Government of India confiscating the proprietary rights in the\r\nsoil. The object in view was not merely to punish contumacious Chiefs,\r\nbut also to enable the Government to establish the revenue system on\r\na sounder and firmer footing. Talukdars who submitted were to receive\r\ntheir possessions as a free gift direct from the Government; while\r\nthose who had done good service, whether men of Oudh or strangers,\r\nmight be rewarded by grants of confiscated property.\r\n\r\nThe Proclamation was considered in many influential quarters too\r\narbitrary and sweeping a measure; Outram protested against it, and\r\nLord Ellenborough (the President of the Board of Control) condemned\r\nit; but Lord Canning was backed up by the British public, and Lord\r\nEllenborough resigned to save his Cabinet from being wrecked. That\r\nOutram and Ellenborough took the right view of the case is, I think,\r\nshown by the fact that Lord Canning cancelled the Proclamation on his\r\nfirst visit to Lucknow. By that time he had come to recognize that the\r\nTalukdars had reasonable grounds for their discontent, and he wisely\r\ndetermined to take a step which not only afforded them the greatest\r\nrelief and satisfaction, but enlisted their interest on the side\r\nof Government. From that day to this, although, from time to time,\r\nsubsequent legislation has been found necessary to save the peasantry\r\nfrom oppression, the Chiefs of Oudh have been amongst the most loyal\r\nof Her Majesty's Indian subjects.\r\n\r\nWe remained a few days longer at Lucknow. Lord and Lady Canning\r\nentertained all the residents, while a ball was given by the latter in\r\nthe Chatta Manzil to the strangers in camp, and the city and principal\r\nbuildings were illuminated in the Viceroy's honour with those curious\r\nlittle oil-lamps which are the most beautiful form of illumination,\r\nthe delineation of every line, point, and pinnacle with myriads of\r\nminute lights producing a wonderfully pretty effect.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th the first march was made on the return journey to\r\nCawnpore. My duty was to go on ahead, select the best site for the\r\nnext day's camping-ground, and make all necessary arrangements for\r\nsupplies, etc. I waited till the Viceroy had given his orders, and\r\nthen my wife and I started off, usually in the forenoon; sometimes\r\nwe remained till later in the day, lunching with one or other of our\r\nfriends in camp, and on very rare occasions, such as a dinner-party at\r\nthe Viceroy's or the Commander-in-Chief's, we drove on after dinner by\r\nmoonlight. But that was not until we had been on the march for some\r\ntime and I felt that the head Native in charge of the camp was to\r\nbe trusted to make no mistake. It was a life of much interest and\r\nvariety, and my wife enjoyed the novelty of it all greatly.\r\n\r\nLord Canning held his second durbar at Cawnpore on the 3rd November,\r\nwhen he received the principal Chiefs of Bundelkand, the Maharaja of\r\nRewa, the Maharaja of Benares, and a host of lesser dignitaries.\r\n\r\nIt was on this occasion that, in accordance with the Proclamation\r\nwhich had already announced that the Queen had no desire to extend her\r\nterritorial possessions, and that the estates of Native Princes were\r\nto be scrupulously respected, the Chiefs were informed that the right\r\nof adoption was conceded to them. This meant that, in default of male\r\nissue, they were to be allowed to adopt sons according to the Indian\r\ncustom of adoption, and that the British Government would recognize\r\nthe right of the chosen heir to succeed as Ruler of the State as well\r\nas to inherit the personal property of the Chief by whom he had been\r\nadopted. There had been no clear rule on this point previously, each\r\ncase having been considered on its own merits, but the doctrine that\r\nadoption should not be recognized, and that, in default of natural\r\nheirs, the State should lapse and be annexed by the supreme\r\nGovernment, had been enforced in a good many instances. Lord Canning's\r\nannouncement therefore caused the liveliest satisfaction to certain\r\nclasses throughout India, and did more than any other measure to\r\nmake the feudatory Princes believe in the sincerity of the amnesty\r\nProclamation.[5]\r\n\r\nOur next move was to Fatehgarh, eight marches from Cawnpore, where,\r\non the 15th November, a third durbar was held, at which was received,\r\namongst other leading men of Rohilkand whose services were considered\r\nworthy of acknowledgment, the Nawab of Rampur, who had behaved\r\nwith distinguished loyalty in our time of trouble. This Mahomedan\r\nNobleman's conduct was the more meritorious in that the surrounding\r\ncountry swarmed with rebels, and was the home of numbers of the\r\nmutinous Irregular Cavalry, while the close proximity of Rampur to\r\nDelhi, whence threats of vengeance were hurled at the Nawab unless he\r\nespoused the King's cause, rendered his position extremely precarious.\r\n\r\nFrom Fatehgarh we proceeded to Agra, nine marches, only halting on\r\nSundays, and consequently everyone appreciated being stationary there\r\nfor a few days. The camp was pitched on the parade-ground, the scene\r\nof the fight of the 10th October, 1857. Here the Viceroy received some\r\nof the bigger potentates, who were accompanied by large retinues, and,\r\nas far as the _spectacle_ went, it was one of the grandest and most\r\ncurious gatherings we had yet witnessed.\r\n\r\nThe occasions are rare on which a Viceroy has the opportunity of\r\nreceiving in durbar the great vassals of our Indian Empire, but when\r\nthese assemblies can be arranged they have a very useful effect,\r\nand should not be looked upon as mere empty ceremonials. This was\r\nespecially the case at a time when the country had so recently been\r\nconvulsed by intestine war, and when the Native Princes were anxiously\r\nconsidering how their prospects would be affected by Her Majesty's\r\nassumption of the administration of India.\r\n\r\nThe Chief of highest rank on this occasion was the Maharaja of\r\nGwalior, who, as I have already stated, influenced by his courageous\r\nMinister, Dinkar Rao, had remained faithful to us. Like most Mahratta\r\nPrinces of that time, he was very imperfectly educated. Moreover, he\r\nwas possessed of a most wayward disposition, frequently threatening,\r\nwhen thwarted in any way, to throw up the reins of government, and\r\ntake refuge in the jungle; manners he had none.\r\n\r\nNext came the enlightened head of the Princely house of Jaipur, the\r\nsecond in importance of the great Chiefs of Rajputana.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by the Karaoli Raja, whose following was the most\r\nquaint of all. Amongst the curious signs of his dignity he had on his\r\nescort four tigers, each chained on a separate car, and guarded by\r\nstrange-looking men in brass helmets.\r\n\r\nThe Maharao Raja of Ulwar was the next to arrive, seated on a\r\nsuperb elephant, eleven feet high, magnificently caparisoned with\r\ncloth-of-gold coverings, and chains and breastplates of gold. He was a\r\npromising-looking lad who had succeeded to his estate only two years\r\nbefore; but he soon fell into the hands of low intriguers, who\r\nplundered his dominions and so oppressed his people that the British\r\nGovernment had to take over the management of his State.\r\n\r\nAfter Ulwar came the Nawab of Tonk, the descendant of an adventurer\r\nfrom Swat, on the Peshawar border, who had become possessed of\r\nconsiderable territory in Rajputana. The Nawab stood by us in the\r\nMutiny, when his capital was plundered by Tantia Topi.\r\n\r\nThe sixth in rank was the Jât Ruler of Dholpur, a bluff,\r\ncoarse-looking man, and a very rude specimen of his race.\r\n\r\nLast of all arrived the Nawab of Jaora, a handsome, perfectly-dressed\r\nman of considerable refinement of manner, and with all the courtesy of\r\na well-bred Mahomedan. Though a feudatory of the rebellious Holkar of\r\nIndore, he kept aloof from all Mahratta intrigues, and behaved well to\r\nus.\r\n\r\nSome of the highest of the Rajput Chiefs declined to attend, alleging\r\nas an excuse the distance of their capitals from Agra; but the truth\r\nis that these Rulers, the best blood of India, had never bowed their\r\nheads to any Power, not even that of the Moghul, and they considered\r\nit would be derogatory to their dignity to obey the summons of the\r\nrepresentative of a sovereign, of whom they considered themselves the\r\nallies and not the mere feudatories.[6]\r\n\r\nThose of the Chieftains attending this durbar who had shown\r\nconspicuous loyalty during the rebellion were not allowed to leave\r\nwithout receiving substantial rewards. Sindhia had territory\r\nbestowed on him to the value of £30,000 a year. Jaipur was given the\r\nconfiscated property of Kôt K[=a]sim, yielding £5,000 a year, while\r\nothers were recompensed according to the importance of the services\r\nrendered.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The depository for jewels and other valuables kept for\r\npresentation to Native Chiefs at durbars.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The following details will give some idea of the\r\nmagnitude of the arrangements required for the Viceroy's camp alone.\r\nBesides those above mentioned there were 500 camels, 500 bullocks and\r\n100 bullock carts for transport of camp equipage, 40 _sowari_ (riding)\r\nelephants, 527 coolies to carry the glass windows belonging to the\r\nlarger tents, 100 _bhisties_, and 40 sweepers for watering and keeping\r\nthe centre street clean. These were in addition to the private baggage\r\nanimals, servants, and numberless riding and driving horses, for all\r\nof which space and shelter had to be provided.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Servants of the Lord of the Country, or\r\nGovernor-General.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: A few drops of attar of roses are given to each person,\r\nand a small packet of _pan_, which is composed of slices of betel-nut\r\nsmeared with lime and wrapped in a leaf of the betel-tree.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The question of Native Rulers having the right to adopt\r\nheirs was first brought to Lord Canning's notice by the three Phulkian\r\nchiefs--Patiala, Jhind and Nabha--who jointly requested in 1858 that\r\nthe right of adoption might be accorded to them as a reward for the\r\nservices they had rendered during the Mutiny. The request was refused\r\nat the time on the ground that it had never been the custom of the\r\ncountry, though it had occasionally been done. Since then, however,\r\nLord Canning had come to see that the uncertainty which prevailed as\r\nto the rights of succession was harassing to the owners of land, and\r\nundesirable in many ways, and he urged upon the Secretary of State\r\nthat some distinct rule on the subject might with advantage be laid\r\ndown. He wrote as follows: 'The crown of England stands forth the\r\nunquestioned Ruler and paramount Power in all India, and is now for\r\nthe first time brought face to face with its feudatories. There is a\r\nreality in the suzerainty of the Sovereign of England which has never\r\nexisted before, which is not only felt, but eagerly acknowledged\r\nby the Chiefs. A great convulsion has been followed by such a\r\nmanifestation of our strength as India has never seen; and if this in\r\nits turn be followed by an act of general and substantial grace, over\r\nand above the special rewards which have already been given to those\r\nwhose services deserve them, the measure will be seasonable and\r\nappreciated.' Lord Canning's proposals met with the cordial approval\r\nof Her Majesty's Government, and his announcement at Cawnpore rejoiced\r\nthe hearts of the Chiefs, one of whom, the Maharaja of Rewa, was a\r\nleper and had no son. He said, on hearing the Viceroy's words, 'They\r\ndispel an evil wind which has long been blowing upon me.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: These Rajput Chiefs, however, accepted Lord Lytton's\r\ninvitation to attend the Imperial Assemblage at Delhi on the 1st\r\nJanuary, 1877, and having once given their allegiance to the 'Empress\r\nof India,' they have since been the most devotedly loyal of Her\r\nMajesty's feudatory Princes.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n1859-1860\r\n\r\n  Delhi under a different aspect--Lord Clyde--Umritsar and Lahore\r\n  --The Lahore Durbar--Simla--Life at Simla\r\n\r\n\r\nWe remained at Agra until the 9th December. There was so much of\r\nbeauty and interest in and around the place, that Lady Canning found\r\na wealth of subjects for her facile pencil, and was well content to\r\nremain there. There were the usual banquets to the residents, and\r\nentertainments given by the Agra people to those in camp, one of them\r\nbeing a party in the Taj gardens, to give us an opportunity of seeing\r\nthe tomb by moonlight, when it certainly looks its loveliest. My wife\r\nwas more delighted even than I had anticipated with the perfect\r\nbeauty of the Taj and the exquisite little mosque in the fort, the\r\nMoti-Masjid. I greatly enjoyed showing her all that was worth seeing,\r\nand witnessing her pleasure on first viewing these wonderful works of\r\nart.\r\n\r\nThere was no halt again, except the usual one on Sunday, until we\r\nreached Meerut on the 21st December.\r\n\r\nThree marches from Agra a fire broke out in Lady Canning's tent soon\r\nafter she had retired for the night, caused by the iron pipe of\r\nthe stove, which passed through the side of the tent, becoming\r\nover-heated. Lady Canning's tents were on one side of the big\r\ndining-tent, and the Viceroy's on the other. Immediately on perceiving\r\nthe fire, Lady Canning ran across to awaken her husband, but the\r\nNative sentry, who did not know her or understand a word of what she\r\nwas saying, would not let her in, and, in despair of being able to\r\nmake anyone hear, she rushed off to the tent of Sir Edward Campbell,\r\nthe Military Secretary, which was nearest her own. She succeeded\r\nin awaking him, and then flew back to try and save some of her own\r\ntreasures. The first thing she thought of was her portfolio of\r\ndrawings, which she dragged outside; but it had already been partially\r\nburned, and most of the valuable and characteristic sketches she had\r\nmade at the different durbars were destroyed. She next tried to rescue\r\nher jewels, many of which she had worn the night before; her pearls\r\nwere lying on the dressing-table, and she was only just in time to\r\nsave them; one of the strings had caught fire, and several of the\r\npearls were blackened. She swept them off the table into a towel, and\r\nthrew them into a tub of water standing outside. Her wardrobe was\r\ncompletely destroyed. More damage would have been done had not the\r\nPrivate Secretary, Mr. Lewin Bowring, on the alarm being given,\r\nhurried to the dining-tent, and, with great presence of mind, ordered\r\nthe Native Cavalry sentry to cut the ropes, causing it to fall at\r\nonce, and preventing the fire from spreading. Some office boxes and\r\nrecords were destroyed, but nothing more. We were as usual in the\r\nadvance camp, and did not hear what had happened until next morning,\r\nwhen Lady Canning arrived dressed in Lady Campbell's clothes; and as\r\nLady Canning was tall, and Lady Campbell was short, the effect was\r\nrather funny.\r\n\r\nChristmas was spent at Meerut, where I met several of my brother\r\nofficers, amongst others my particular friend Edwin Johnson, whom I\r\nhad the great pleasure of introducing to my wife. With scarcely\r\nan exception, my friends became hers, and this added much to the\r\nhappiness of our Indian life.\r\n\r\nDelhi, our next halting-place, was certainly not the least interesting\r\nin our tour. Lord Canning was anxious to understand all about the\r\nsiege, and visited the different positions; the Ridge and its\r\nsurroundings, the breaches, and the palace, were the chief points\r\nof interest. There were two 'Delhi men' besides myself to explain\r\neverything to him, Sir Edward Campbell, who was with the 60th Rifles\r\nthroughout, and one of the best officers in the regiment, and Jemmy\r\nHills, who had now become the Viceroy's Aide-de-camp; while in Lord\r\nClyde's camp there were Norman, Stewart, and Becher.\r\n\r\nI had, of course, taken my wife to the scenes of the fights at Agra,\r\nAligarh, and Bulandshahr, but Delhi had the greatest fascination for\r\nher. It is certainly an extraordinarily attractive place, setting\r\naside the peculiar interest of the siege. For hundreds of years it had\r\nbeen the seat of Government under Rulers of various nationalities and\r\nreligions; few cities have the remains of so much pomp and glory, and\r\nvery few bear the traces of having been besieged so often, or could\r\ntell of so much blood spilt in their defence, or of such quantities of\r\ntreasure looted from them. When Tamerlane captured Delhi in 1398 the\r\ncity was given over to massacre for five days, 'some streets being\r\nrendered impassable by heaps of dead'; and in 1739 the Persian\r\nconqueror, Nadir Shah, after sacking the place for fifty-eight days\r\nand massacring thousands of its inhabitants, carried off thirty-two\r\nmillions sterling of booty.\r\n\r\nAlthough the fierce nature of the struggle that Delhi had gone through\r\nin 1857 was apparent everywhere, the inhabitants seemed now to have\r\nforgotten all about it. The city was as densely populated as it had\r\never been; the Chandni Chauk was gay as formerly with draperies of\r\nbright-coloured stuffs; jewellers and shawl-merchants carried on their\r\ntrades as briskly as ever, and were just as eager in their endeavours\r\nto tempt the _Sahib log_ to spend their money as if trade had never\r\nbeen interrupted; so quickly do Orientals recover from the effects of\r\na devastating war.\r\n\r\nWe left Delhi on the 3rd January, 1860, marching _viâ_ Karnal. When at\r\nthis place my wife went to see Lady Canning, as she often did if we\r\nremained at all late in camp. On this particular occasion she found\r\nher busy with the English mail, which had just arrived, so she said\r\nshe would not stay then, but would come next day instead. Lady\r\nCanning, however, would not let my wife go until she had read her part\r\nof a letter from Lady Waterford, which she thought would amuse her. It\r\nwas in answer to one from Lady Canning, in which she had described\r\nthe camp, and given her sister a list of all the people in it. Lady\r\nWaterford wrote: 'Your Quartermaster-General must be the son of\r\nGeneral Roberts, who lives near Waterford; he came home on leave last\r\nyear. I must tell you an amusing little anecdote about his father. One\r\nnight, when the General was dining at Curraghmore, he found himself\r\nsitting next the Primate of Ireland, with whom he entered into\r\nconversation. After some time they discovered they had known each\r\nother in the days of their youth, but had never met since a certain\r\nmorning on which they went out to fight a duel on account of some\r\nsquabble at a mess; happily the quarrel was stopped without any harm\r\nbeing done, each feeling equally relieved at being prevented from\r\ntrying to murder the other, as they had been persuaded they were in\r\nhonour bound to do. The two old gentlemen made very merry over their\r\nreminiscences.'\r\n\r\nFor some time I had been indulging a hope that I might be sent to\r\nChina with my old General, Hope Grant, who had been nominated to the\r\ncommand of the expedition which, in co-operation with the French, was\r\nbeing prepared to wipe out the disgrace of the repulse experienced\r\nearly in the year, by the combined French and English naval squadrons\r\nin their attack on the Taku forts. My hope, however, was doomed to\r\ndisappointment. Lord Clyde decided to send Lumsden and Allgood as\r\nA.Q.M.G.'s with the force, and I was feeling very low in consequence.\r\nA day or two afterwards we dined with the Cannings, and Lord Clyde\r\ntook my wife in to dinner. His first remark to her was: 'I think I\r\nhave earned your gratitude, if I have not managed to satisfy everyone\r\nby these China appointments.' On my wife asking for what she was\r\nexpected to be grateful, he said: 'Why, for not sending your husband\r\nwith the expedition, of course. I suppose you would rather not be\r\nleft in a foreign country alone a few months after your marriage? If\r\nRoberts had not been a newly-married man, I would have sent him.'\r\nThis was too much for my wife, who sympathized greatly with my\r\ndisappointment, and she could not help retorting: 'I am afraid I\r\ncannot be very grateful to you for making my husband feel I am ruining\r\nhis career by standing in the way of his being sent on service. You\r\nhave done your best to make him regret his marriage.' The poor old\r\nChief was greatly astonished, and burst out in his not too refined\r\nway: 'Well, I'll be hanged if I can understand you women! I have done\r\nthe very thing I thought you would like, and have only succeeded in\r\nmaking you angry. I will never try to help a woman again.' My wife\r\nsaw that he had meant to be kind, and that it was, as he said, only\r\nbecause he did not 'understand women' that he had made the mistake.\r\nShe was soon appeased, and in the end she and Lord Clyde became great\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nThe middle of January found us at Umballa, where Lord Canning met in\r\nstate all the Cis-Sutlej Sikh Chiefs. Fine, handsome men they most of\r\nthem were, and magnificently attired. The beautifully delicate tints\r\nwhich the Sikhs are so fond of, the warlike costumes of some of the\r\nSirdars, the quiet dignity of these high-born men who had rendered\r\nus such signal service in our hour of need, made the scene most\r\npicturesque and impressive. The place of honour was given to the\r\nMaharaja of Patiala (the grandfather of the present Maharaja), as the\r\nmost powerful of the Phulkian Princes; and he was followed by his\r\nneighbours of Nabha and Jhind, all three splendid specimens of\r\nwell-bred Sikhs, of stately presence and courtly manners. They were\r\nmuch gratified at having the right of adoption granted to their\r\nfamilies, and at being given substantial rewards in the shape of\r\nextension of territory.\r\n\r\nThe Sikh Chiefs were followed by Rajas of minor importance, chiefly\r\nfrom the neighbouring hills, whom the Viceroy had summoned in order to\r\nthank them for assistance rendered during the Mutiny. Many of them had\r\ngrievances to be redressed; others had favours to ask; and the Viceroy\r\nwas able to more or less satisfy them by judiciously yielding to\r\nreasonable demands, and by bestowing minor powers on those who were\r\nlikely to use them well. The wisdom of this policy of concession\r\non Lord Canning's part was proved in after years by its successful\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th January the Raja of Kapurthala came out to meet the\r\nViceroy one march from Jullundur. He had supplemented the valuable\r\nassistance rendered to Colonel Lake in the early days of the Mutiny\r\nby equipping and taking into Oudh a force of 2,000 men, which he\r\npersonally commanded in six different actions. The Viceroy cordially\r\nthanked him for this timely service, and in recognition of it, and his\r\ncontinued and conspicuous loyalty, bestowed upon him large estates in\r\nOudh, where he eventually became one of the chief Talukdars. This Raja\r\nwas the grandfather of the enlightened nobleman who came to England\r\nthree years ago.\r\n\r\nAfter visiting Umritsar, gay with brilliant illuminations in honour\r\nof the Viceroy, and crowded with Sikhs come to welcome the Queen's\r\nrepresentative to their sacred city, we arrived at Lahore on the 10th\r\nFebruary.\r\n\r\nEarly the following morning Lord Canning made his state entry. As we\r\napproached the citadel the long line of mounted Chiefs drawn up to\r\nreceive the Viceroy came into view. A brilliant assemblage they\r\nformed, Sikh Sirdars, stately Hill Rajputs, wildly picturesque\r\nMultanis and Baluchis with their flowing locks floating behind them,\r\nsturdy Tawanas from the Salt range, all gorgeously arrayed in every\r\ncolour of the rainbow, their jewels glittering in the morning sun,\r\nwhile their horses, magnificently caparisoned in cloth-of-gold saddle\r\ncloths, and gold and silver trappings, pranced and curvetted under\r\npressure of their severe bits. As the procession appeared in sight\r\nthey moved forward in one long dazzling cavalcade, each party of\r\nChiefs being headed by the Commissioner of the district from which\r\nthey came; they saluted as they approached the Viceroy, and then\r\npassing him fell in behind, between the Body Guard and the Artillery\r\nof the escort. A royal salute was fired from the fort as we passed\r\nunder the city walls; we then wound through the civil station of\r\nAnárkáli, and on to camp where the garrison of Mian Mir, under the\r\ncommand of Major-General Sir Charles Windham, was drawn up to receive\r\nthe Viceroy.\r\n\r\nAt nightfall there were illuminations and a procession of elephants;\r\nthe Viceroy, seated in a superb howdah, led the way through the\r\nbrilliantly lighted city. Suddenly a shower of rockets was discharged\r\nwhich resulted in a stampede of the elephants, who rushed through the\r\nnarrow streets, and fled in every direction, to the imminent peril and\r\ngreat discomfort of the riders. In time they were quieted and\r\nbrought back, only to become again unmanageable at a fresh volley of\r\nfireworks; a second time they were pacified, and as they seemed to be\r\ngetting accustomed to the noise and lights, the procession proceeded\r\nto the garden of the old palace. Here the elephants were drawn up,\r\nwhen all at once a fresh discharge of rockets from every side drove\r\nthem mad with fright, and off they bolted under the trees, through\r\ngates, and some of them could not be pulled up until they had gone far\r\ninto the country. Howdahs were crushed, hats torn off, but, strange to\r\nsay, there was only one serious casualty; an officer was swept out of\r\nhis howdah by the branch of a tree, and falling to the ground, had his\r\nthigh broken. Lord Clyde declared that a general action was not half\r\nso dangerous, and he would much sooner have been in one!\r\n\r\nThe Lahore durbar, at which the Punjab Chiefs were received, surpassed\r\nany former ceremonials in point of numbers and splendour of effect.\r\nMany of Runjit Singh's Sirdars were present, and many who had fought\r\nagainst us in the Sutlej and Punjab campaigns, but had now become our\r\nfast friends. The Chiefs quite spontaneously prepared and presented\r\nLord Canning with an address, and, in reply, his Excellency made\r\nan eloquent and telling speech, commenting in terms of the highest\r\nappreciation on the courage and loyalty displayed by the Nobles and\r\npeople of the Punjab during the Mutiny.\r\n\r\nWhile the camp was marching to Sialkot, where the Maharaja of Kashmir\r\nand some of the leading men of the Punjab were to be received, the\r\nViceroy, accompanied by Lady Canning, Lord Clyde, and a small staff,\r\nwent on a flying visit to Peshawar, with the object of satisfying\r\nhimself, by personal examination of our position there, as to the\r\nadvisability or otherwise of a retirement cis-Indus--a retrograde\r\nmovement which John Lawrence was still in favour of. The visit,\r\nhowever, only served to strengthen Lord Canning in his preconceived\r\nopinion that Peshawar must be held on to as our frontier station.\r\n\r\nMy wife remained at Mian Mir with our good friends Doctor and Mrs.\r\nTyrrell Ross until it was time for her to go to Simla, and the kind\r\nthoughtfulness of Lord Canning, who told me the camp now worked so\r\nwell that my presence was not always necessary, enabled me to be with\r\nher from time to time.\r\n\r\nLord Canning's tour was now nearly over, and we marched without any\r\nhalt of importance from Sialkot to Kalka at the foot of the hills,\r\nwhere, on the 9th April, the camp was broken up. It was high time to\r\nget into cooler regions, for the heat of the tents in the day had\r\nbecome very oppressive.\r\n\r\nThus ended a six months' march of over a thousand miles--a march never\r\nlikely to be undertaken again by any other Viceroy of India, now that\r\nrailway trains run from Calcutta to Peshawar, and saloon carriages\r\nhave taken the place of big tents.\r\n\r\nThis progress through India had excellent results. The advantages of\r\nthe representative of the Sovereign meeting face to face the principal\r\nfeudatories and Chiefs of our great dependency were very considerable,\r\nand the opportunity afforded to the Viceroy of personally\r\nacknowledging and rewarding the services of those who had helped us,\r\nand of showing that he was not afraid to be lenient to those who had\r\nfailed to do so, provided they should remain loyal in the future, had\r\na very good effect over the whole of India. The wise concessions also\r\nannounced at the different durbars as regards the adoption by Native\r\nRulers of successors to their estates, and the grant to Native\r\ngentlemen of such a share as they were fitted for in the government\r\nof the country, were undoubtedly more appreciated than any other\r\ndescription of reward given for assistance in the Mutiny.\r\n\r\nMy duty with the Viceroy being ended, I returned to Mian Mir to fetch\r\nmy wife and the little daughter, who had made her appearance on the\r\n10th March, and escort them both to Simla. The journey up the hill was\r\na tedious one. Carriages were not then used as they are now, and my\r\nwife travelled in a _jampan_, a kind of open, half-reclining sedan\r\nchair, carried by relays of four men, while I rode or walked by her\r\nside. She had been greatly exhausted by the heat of the journey from\r\nMian Mir, but as we ascended higher and higher up the mountain side,\r\nand the atmosphere became clearer and fresher, she began to revive.\r\nFour hours, however, of this unaccustomed mode of travelling in her\r\nweak state had completely tired her out, so on finding a fairly\r\ncomfortable bungalow at the end of the first stage, I decided to\r\nremain there the next day. After that we went on, stage by stage,\r\nuntil we reached Simla. Our house, 'Mount Pleasant,' was on the very\r\ntop of a hill; up and up we climbed through the rhododendron forest,\r\nalong a path crimson with the fallen blossom, till we got to the top,\r\nwhen a glorious view opened out before our delighted eyes. The wooded\r\nhills of Jakho and Elysium in the foreground, Mahasu and the beautiful\r\nShalli peaks in the middle distance, and beyond, towering above all,\r\nthe everlasting snows glistening in the morning sun, formed a picture\r\nthe beauty of which quite entranced us both. I could hardly persuade\r\nmy wife to leave it and come into the house. Hunger and fatigue,\r\nhowever, at length triumphed. Our servants had arranged everything in\r\nour little abode most comfortably; bright fires were burning in the\r\ngrates, a cosy breakfast was awaiting us, and the feeling that at last\r\nwe had a home of our own was very pleasant.\r\n\r\nLord Canning did not remain long at Simla. His Council in Calcutta was\r\nabout to lose its President, Sir James Outram, who was leaving India\r\non account of failing health; and as the suggestion to impose an\r\nincome-tax was creating a good deal of agitation, the Viceroy hurried\r\nback to Calcutta, deeming it expedient to be on the spot.\r\n\r\nThe measures necessary for the suppression of the Mutiny had emptied\r\nthe Government coffers; and although a large loan had been raised,\r\nthe local authorities found it impossible to cope with the increased\r\nexpenditure. Lord Canning had, therefore, applied to the Government in\r\nEngland for the services of a trained financier; and Mr. Wilson, who\r\nhad a great reputation in this respect, was sent out. He declared the\r\nonly remedy to be an income-tax, and he was supported in this view\r\nby the merchants of Calcutta. Other Europeans, however, who were\r\nintimately acquainted with India, pointed out that it was not\r\nadvisable to ignore the dislike of Natives to such direct taxation;\r\nand Sir Charles Trevelyan, Governor of Madras, argued well and wisely\r\nagainst the scheme. Instead, however, of confining his action in the\r\nmatter to warning and advising the supreme Government, he publicly\r\nproclaimed his opposition, thus giving the signal for agitation to all\r\nthe malcontents in India. Lord Elphinstone, the Governor of Bombay,\r\nfollowed Trevelyan's example, but in a less pronounced manner,\r\nand these attacks from the minor Presidencies proved a serious\r\nembarrassment to the action of the Government. In spite of all this\r\nantagonism, the income-tax was passed, and Sir Charles Trevelyan's\r\nunusual procedure led to his recall.\r\n\r\nLord Canning left Simla for his long and trying journey in May, about\r\nthe hottest time of the year. On my taking leave of him, he told\r\nme that Sir Hugh Rose, then commanding the Bombay army, had been\r\nappointed to succeed Lord Clyde, who had long been anxious to return\r\nto England, and that Sir Hugh, though he intended to go to Calcutta\r\nhimself, wished the Head-Quarters of the Army to remain at Simla; a\r\nquestion about which we had been rather anxious, as it would have been\r\nan unpleasant breaking up of all our plans, had I been ordered to\r\nCalcutta.\r\n\r\nLife at Simla was somewhat monotonous. The society was not very large\r\nin those days; but there were a certain number of people on leave\r\nfrom the plains, who then, as at present, had nothing to do but amuse\r\nthemselves, consequently there was a good deal of gaiety in a small\r\nway; but we entered into it very little. My wife did not care much\r\nabout it, and had been very ill for the greater part of the summer.\r\nShe had made two or three kind friends, and was very happy in her\r\nmountain home, though at times, perhaps, a little lonely, as I had to\r\nbe in office the greater part of each day.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn we made a trip into the interior of the hills, beyond\r\nSimla, which was a new and delightful experience for my wife. We\r\nusually started in the morning, sending our servants on about half\r\nway, when they prepared breakfast for us in some pretty, shady spot;\r\nthere we remained, reading, writing, or resting, until after lunch,\r\nand it was time to move on, that we might get to our halting place for\r\nthe night before dinner.\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely time of the year, when the autumn tints made the\r\nforest gorgeous, and the scarlet festoons of the Himalayan vine stood\r\nout in brilliant contrast to the dark green of the solemn deodar,\r\namongst the branches of which it loves to twine itself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n1860\r\n\r\n  The Staff Corps--With the Viceroy's camp again--The marble rocks\r\n  --Lady Canning's death--Pig-sticking at Jamu--Lord Canning\r\n  --Another cold-weather march--Gwalior and Jhansi\r\n  --Departmental promotion\r\n\r\nIn 1860 an important alteration was made in the organization of the\r\narmy in India, by the passing of a Bill for the amalgamation of the\r\nlocal European Forces with the Royal Army.\r\n\r\nOn the transfer of the administration of India from the Honourable\r\nEast India Company to the Crown, a question arose as to the conditions\r\nunder which the European soldiers had enlisted. The Government\r\ncontended that the conditions were in no way affected by the abolition\r\nof the Company. The soldiers, on the other hand, claimed to be\r\nre-enlisted, and on this being refused they asked for their discharge.\r\nThis was granted, and 10,000 out of the 16,000 men serving in the\r\nlocal army had to be sent to England. These men were replaced and the\r\nlocal Forces were kept up to strength by fresh drafts from England;\r\nbut, from the date of the amalgamation, enlistment to serve solely in\r\nIndia was to cease.\r\n\r\nThere was great difference of opinion as to the advisability of this\r\nmeasure; officers of the Queen's service for the most part, and\r\nnotably Sir Hugh Rose, were in favour of it, but it was not generally\r\npopular in India. It was feared that the change would result in a\r\ngreat increase to the military charges which the Indian Government\r\nwould be called upon to pay; that, notwithstanding such increase,\r\nthere would be a serious diminution in the control exercised by that\r\nGovernment over the administration and organization of the British\r\nArmy in India; and that, under the pressure of political emergency in\r\nEurope, troops might be withdrawn and Indian requirements disregarded.\r\nOn the other hand, those in favour of the Bill thought that, after the\r\ntransfer of India to the Crown, the maintenance of a separate Force\r\nuncontrolled by the Horse Guards would be an anomaly. There was, no\r\ndoubt, much to be said on both sides of the question, but, although it\r\nhas been proved that the fears of those opposed to the change were not\r\naltogether without foundation, in my opinion it was unavoidable, and\r\nhas greatly benefited both services.\r\n\r\nThe amalgamation considerably accelerated my promotion, for, in order\r\nto place the Indian Ordnance Corps on the same footing as those of the\r\nRoyal service, the rank of Second Captain had to be introduced into\r\nthe former, a rank to which I attained in October, 1860, only,\r\nhowever, to hold it for one day, as the next my name appeared in the\r\n_Gazette_ as a Brevet Major.\r\n\r\nThe same year saw the introduction of the Staff Corps. This was the\r\noutcome of the disappearance during the Mutiny of nearly the whole of\r\nthe Regular regiments of the Bengal Army, and their replacement by\r\nIrregular regiments. But, as under the Irregular system the number of\r\nBritish officers with each corps was too limited to admit of their\r\npromotion being carried on regimentally, as had been done under the\r\nRegular system,[1] some organization had to be devised by which the\r\npay and promotion of all officers joining the Indian Army in future\r\ncould be arranged. Many schemes were put forward; eventually one\r\nformulated by Colonel Norman was, with certain modifications, accepted\r\nby the Secretary of State, the result being that all officers about\r\nto enter the Indian Army were to be placed on one list, in which they\r\nwould be promoted after fixed periods of service;[2] and all those\r\nofficers who had been thrown out of employment by the disbandment\r\nof their regiments, or by the substitution of the Irregular for the\r\nRegular system, were to have the option of joining it. The term Staff\r\nCorps, however, was a misnomer, for the constitution of the Corps and\r\nthe training of its officers had no special connection with staff\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the summer the Viceroy announced his intention of\r\nmaking a march through Central India, and I was again ordered to take\r\ncharge of his camp, which was to be formed at Benares. My wife and her\r\nbaby remained at Simla with our friends the Donald Stewarts, and I\r\nleft her feeling sure that with them she would be happy and well taken\r\ncare of.\r\n\r\nSir Hugh Rose was at Allahabad, and as I passed through that place I\r\navailed myself of the opportunity to pay my respects to the new Chief,\r\nbeing anxious to meet an officer whom I had held in great admiration\r\nfrom the time when, as _Chargé d'affaires_ at Constantinople, his\r\npluck and foresight practically saved Turkey in her time of peril\r\nfrom Russia's threatened attack--admiration increased by the masterly\r\nmanner in which he had conducted the Central India campaign, in spite\r\nof almost overwhelming difficulties from want of transport and\r\nother causes, and a severe attack of sunstroke, which would have\r\nincapacitated many men. Sir Hugh Rose, when I first met him at\r\nAllahabad, was fifty-nine years of age, tall, slight, with refined\r\nfeatures, rather delicate-looking, and possessing a distinctly\r\ndistinguished appearance. He received me most kindly, and told me\r\nthat he wished me to return to Head-Quarters when the Viceroy could\r\ndispense with my services.\r\n\r\nThe camp this year was by no means on so grand a scale as the\r\npreceding one. The escort was much smaller, and the Commander-in-Chief\r\nwith Army Head-Quarters did not march with us as on the previous\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nLord and Lady Canning arrived by steamer at Benares on the 6th\r\nNovember, and I went on board to meet them. Lord Canning was cordial\r\nand pleasant as usual, but I did not think he looked well. Lady\r\nCanning was charming as ever; she reproached me for not having brought\r\nmy wife, but when I told her how ill she had been, she agreed that\r\ncamp was not quite the place for her.\r\n\r\nBenares, to my mind, is a most disappointing city; the streets\r\nare narrow and dirty, there are no fine buildings, and it is only\r\ninteresting from its being held so sacred by the Hindus. The view of\r\nthe city and burning ghâts from the river is picturesque and pretty,\r\nbut there is nothing else worth seeing.\r\n\r\nTwo days were occupied in getting the camp to Mirzarpur, on the\r\nopposite bank of the Ganges. There was no bridge, and everything had\r\nto be taken over in boats; 10,000 men, 1,000 horses, 2,000 camels,\r\n2,000 bullocks, besides all the tents, carts, and baggage, had to be\r\nferried across the great river. The 180 elephants swam over with their\r\n_mahouts_ on their backs to keep their heads straight and urge them\r\non; the stream was rapid, and it was a difficult business to land them\r\nsafely at the other side, but at last it was accomplished, and our\r\nonly casualty was one camel, which fell overboard.\r\n\r\nThe march to Jubbulpur lay through very pretty scenery, low hills\r\nand beautiful jungle, ablaze with the flame-coloured blossom of the\r\ndhâk-tree. Game abounded, and an occasional tiger was killed. Lord\r\nCanning sometimes accompanied the shooting expeditions, but not often,\r\nfor he was greatly engrossed in, and oppressed by, his work, which he\r\nappeared unable to throw off. Even during the morning's drive he was\r\noccupied with papers, and on reaching camp he went straight to his\r\noffice tent, where he remained the whole day till dinner-time,\r\nreturning to it directly the meal was over, unless there were\r\nstrangers present with whom he wished to converse.\r\n\r\nAt Jubbulpur the Viceroy held a durbar for the Maharaja Tukaji Holkar\r\nof Indore, and some minor Chiefs of that part of the country. Holkar's\r\nconduct during the Mutiny was not altogether above suspicion, but,\r\nconsidering that the only troops at his disposal belonged to the\r\nmutinous Indore Contingent, which consisted mainly of Hindustanis\r\nenlisted by English officers, over whom he could not be expected to\r\nexercise much control, Lord Canning gave him the benefit of the doubt,\r\nand was willing to attribute his equivocal behaviour to want of\r\nability and timidity, rather than to disloyalty, and therefore allowed\r\nhim to come to the durbar.\r\n\r\nAnother potentate received at this time by the Viceroy was the Begum\r\nof Bhopal, who, being a powerful and skilful Ruler, and absolutely\r\nloyal to the British Government, had afforded us most valuable\r\nassistance during the rebellion. She was one of those women whom the\r\nEast has occasionally produced, endowed with conspicuous talent and\r\ngreat strength of character, a quality which, from its rarity amongst\r\nIndian women, gives immense influence to those who possess it. Lord\r\nCanning congratulated the Begum on the success with which she had\r\ngoverned her country, thanked her for her timely help, and\r\nbestowed upon her a large tract of country as a reward. She was\r\na determined-looking little woman, and spoke fluently in her own\r\nlanguage; she personally managed the affairs of her State, and wrote a\r\nremarkably interesting account of her travelling experiences during a\r\npilgrimage to Mecca.\r\n\r\nJust as the Begum took her departure, news was brought in of the\r\npresence of a tiger two or three miles from the cantonment, and as\r\nmany of us as could get away started off in pursuit. Not considering\r\nmyself a first-rate shot, I thought I should be best employed with the\r\nbeaters, but, as good luck would have it, the tiger broke from the\r\njungle within a few yards of my elephant: I could not resist having a\r\nshot, and was fortunate enough to knock him over.\r\n\r\nWhile at Jubbulpur, I visited the famous marble rocks on the Nerbudda.\r\nWe rowed up the river for about a mile, when the stream began to\r\nnarrow, and splendid masses of marble came into view. The cliffs rise\r\nto about a hundred feet in height, pure white below, gradually shading\r\noff to gray at the top. The water at their base is of a deep brown\r\ncolour; perfectly transparent and smooth, in which the white rocks are\r\nreflected with the utmost distinctness. In the crevices hang numerous\r\nbeehives, whose inmates one has to be careful not to disturb, for on\r\nthe bank are the graves of two Englishmen who, having incautiously\r\naroused the vicious little creatures, were attacked and drowned in\r\ndiving under the water to escape from their stings.\r\n\r\nA few days later the Viceroy left camp, and proceeded to Lucknow,\r\nwhere he held another durbar for the Talukdars of Oudh. Lady Canning\r\ncontinued to march with us to Mirzapur, where I took her on board her\r\nbarge, and bade her farewell--a last farewell, for I never saw this\r\ngood, beautiful, and gifted woman again.\r\n\r\nThe camp being broken up, I returned towards the end of February to my\r\nwork in the Quartermaster-General's Office at Simla. I found the place\r\ndeep in snow; it looked very beautiful, but the change of temperature,\r\nfrom the great heat of Central India to several degrees of frost, was\r\nsomewhat trying. My wife had benefited greatly from the fine bracing\r\nair, and both she and our baby appeared pictures of health; but a day\r\nor two after my arrival the little one was taken ill, and died within\r\none week of her birthday--our first great sorrow.\r\n\r\nWe passed a very quiet, uneventful summer, and in the beginning of\r\nOctober we left Simla for Allahabad, where I had received instructions\r\nto prepare a camp for the Viceroy, who had arranged to hold an\r\ninvestiture of the Star of India, the new Order which was originally\r\ndesigned to honour the principal Chiefs of India who had done us\r\ngood service, by associating them with some of the highest and most\r\ndistinguished personages in England, and a few carefully selected\r\nEuropeans in India. Lord Canning was the first Grand Master, and Sir\r\nHugh Rose the first Knight.\r\n\r\nThe durbar at which the Maharajas Sindhia and Patiala, the Begum of\r\nBhopal, and the Nawab of Rampur were invested, was a most imposing\r\nceremony. The Begum was the cynosure of all eyes--a female Knight\r\nwas a novelty to Europeans as well as to Natives--and there was much\r\ncuriosity as to how she would conduct herself; but no one could have\r\nbehaved with greater dignity or more perfect decorum, and she made a\r\npretty little speech in Urdu in reply to Lord Canning's complimentary\r\naddress. She was dressed in cloth-of-gold, and wore magnificent\r\njewels; but the effect of her rich costume was somewhat marred by a\r\nfunny little wreath of artificial flowers, woollen mittens, and black\r\nworsted stockings with white tips. When my wife visited the Begum\r\nafter the durbar, she showed her these curious appendages with great\r\npride, saying she wore them because they were 'English fashion.' This\r\nwas the first occasion on which ladies were admitted to a durbar, out\r\nof compliment to the Begum.\r\n\r\nThat evening my wife was taken in to dinner by a man whose manner and\r\nappearance greatly impressed her, but she did not catch his name when\r\nhe was introduced; she much enjoyed his conversation during dinner,\r\nwhich was not to be wondered at, for, before she left the table, he\r\ntold her his name was Bartle Frere.[3] She never saw him again, but\r\nshe always says he interested her more than almost any of the many\r\ndistinguished men she has since met.\r\n\r\nFrom Allahabad the Viceroy again visited Lucknow, this time with the\r\nobject of urging upon the Talukdars the suppression of the horrible\r\ncustom of female infanticide, which had its origin in the combined\r\npride and poverty of the Rajputs. In various parts of India attempts\r\nhad been made, with more or less success, to put a stop to this\r\ninhuman practice. But not much impression had been made in Oudh, in\r\nconsequence of the inordinately large dowries demanded from the Rajput\r\nfathers of marriageable daughters. Two hundred Talukdars attended\r\nLord Canning's last durbar, and, in reply to his feeling and telling\r\nspeech, declared their firm determination to do their best to\r\ndiscourage the evil.\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief had decided to pass the winter in marching\r\nthrough the Punjab, and inspecting the different stations for troops\r\nin the north of India. The Head-Quarters camp had, therefore, been\r\nformed at Jullundur, and thither we proceeded when the gathering at\r\nAllahabad had dispersed. We had but just arrived, when we were shocked\r\nand grieved beyond measure to hear of Lady Canning's death. Instead of\r\naccompanying the Viceroy to Allahabad she had gone to Darjeeling,\r\nand on her return, anxious to make sketches of the beautiful jungle\r\nscenery, she arranged, alas! contrary to the advice of those with\r\nher, to spend one night in the _terai_,[4] where she contracted\r\njungle-fever, to which she succumbed ten days after her return to\r\nCalcutta. Her death was a real personal sorrow to all who had the\r\nprivilege of knowing her; what must it have been to her husband,\r\nreturning to England without the helpmate who had shared and lightened\r\nthe burden of his anxieties, and gloried in the success which crowned\r\nhis eventful career in India.\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief arrived in the middle of November, and all the\r\nofficers of the Head-Quarters camp went out to meet him. I was mounted\r\non a spirited nutmeg-gray Arab, a present from Allgood. Sir Hugh\r\ngreatly fancied Arabian horses, and immediately noticed mine. He\r\ncalled me up to him, and asked me where I got him, and of what\r\ncaste he was. From that moment he never varied in the kindness and\r\nconsideration with which he treated me, and I always fancied I owed\r\nhis being well disposed towards me from the very first to the fact\r\nthat I was riding my handsome little Arab that day; he loved a good\r\nhorse, and liked his staff to be well mounted. A few days afterwards\r\nhe told me he wished me to accompany him on the flying tours he\r\nproposed to make from time to time, in order to see more of the\r\ncountry and troops than would be possible if he marched altogether\r\nwith the big camp.\r\n\r\nWe went to Umritsar, Mian Mir, and Sialkot; at each place there were\r\nthe usual inspections, mess dinners, and entertainments. The Chief's\r\nvisit made a break in the ordinary life of a cantonment, and the\r\nresidents were glad to take advantage of it to get up various\r\nfestivities; Sir Hugh, too, was most hospitably inclined, so that\r\nthere was always a great deal to do besides actual duty when we\r\narrived at a station.\r\n\r\nJamu, where the Ruler of Kashmir resides during the winter, is not far\r\nfrom Sialkot, so Sir Hugh was tempted to accept an invitation from the\r\nMaharaja to pay him a visit and enjoy some good pig-sticking, to my\r\nmind the finest sport in the world. His Highness entertained us right\r\nroyally, and gave us excellent sport, but our pleasure was marred by\r\nthe Chief having a bad fall: he had got the first spear off a fine\r\nboar, who, feeling himself wounded, turned and charged, knocking over\r\nSir Hugh's horse. All three lay in a heap together; the pig was dead,\r\nthe horse was badly ripped up, and the Chief showed no signs of life.\r\nWe carried him back to Jamu on a _charpoy_[5] and when he regained\r\nconsciousness we found that no great harm was done beyond a severely\r\nbruised face and a badly sprained leg, which, though still very\r\npainful two or three days later, did not prevent the plucky old fellow\r\nfrom riding over the battle-field of Chilianwalla.\r\n\r\nVery soon after this Norman, who was then Adjutant-General of the\r\nArmy, left Head-Quarters to take up the appointment of Secretary to\r\nthe Government of India in the Military Department. Before we parted\r\nhe expressed a hope that I would soon follow him, as a vacancy in the\r\nDepartment was about to take place, which he said he was sure Lord\r\nCanning would allow him to offer to me. Norman was succeeded as\r\nAdjutant-General of the Indian Army by Edwin Johnson, the last officer\r\nwho filled that post, as it was done away with when the amalgamation\r\nof the services was carried into effect.\r\n\r\nTwo marches from Jhelum my wife was suddenly taken alarmingly ill, and\r\nhad to remain behind when the camp moved on. Sir Hugh Rose most kindly\r\ninsisted on leaving his doctor (Longhurst) in charge of her, and told\r\nme I must stay with her as long as was necessary. For three whole\r\nweeks we remained on the encamping ground of Sahawar; at the end of\r\nthat time, thanks (humanly speaking) to the skill and care of our\r\nDoctor, she was sufficiently recovered to be put into a doolie and\r\ncarried to Lahore, I riding a camel by her side, for my horses had\r\ngone on with the camp.\r\n\r\nWhile at Lahore I received a most kind letter from Norman, offering me\r\nthe post in the Secretariat which he had already told me was about\r\nto become vacant. After some hesitation--for the Secretariat had its\r\nattractions, particularly as regarded pay--I decided to decline the\r\nproffered appointment, as my acceptance of it would have taken me away\r\nfrom purely military work and the chance of service in the field. I\r\nleft my wife on the high-road to recovery, and hurried after the\r\ncamp, overtaking it at Peshawar just in time to accompany the\r\nCommander-in-Chief on his ride along the Derajat frontier, a trip I\r\nshould have been very sorry to have missed. We visited every station\r\nfrom Kohat to Rajanpur, a ride of about 440 miles. Brigadier-General\r\nNeville Chamberlain, who was still commanding the Punjab Frontier\r\nForce, met us at Kohat, and remained with us to the end. We did from\r\ntwenty-five to forty miles a day, and our baggage and servants,\r\ncarried on riding-camels, kept up with us.\r\n\r\nThis was my first experience of a part of India with which I had later\r\nso much to do, and which always interested me greatly. At the time of\r\nwhich I am writing it was a wild and lawless tract of country. As we\r\nleft Kohat we met the bodies of four murdered men being carried in,\r\nbut were told there was nothing unusual in such a sight. On one\r\noccasion General Chamberlain introduced to Sir Hugh Rose two young\r\nKhans, fine, handsome fellows, who were apparently on excellent terms.\r\nA few days later we were told that one of them had been murdered by\r\nhis companion, there having been a blood-feud between their families\r\nfor generations; although these two had been brought up together, and\r\nliked each other, the one whose clan had last lost a member by the\r\nfeud felt himself in honour bound to sacrifice his friend.\r\n\r\nWhen I rejoined my wife at the end of the tour, I found her a great\r\ndeal worse than her letters had led me to expect, but she had been\r\nmuch cheered by the arrival of a sister who had come out to pay us\r\na visit, and who lived with us until she married an old friend and\r\nbrother officer of mine named Sladen. We remained at Umballa till the\r\nend of March; the only noteworthy circumstance that occurred there was\r\na parade for announcing to the troops that Earl Canning had departed,\r\nand that the Earl of Elgin and Kincardine was now Viceroy of India.\r\n\r\nThere are few men whose conduct of affairs has been so severely\r\ncriticized as Lord Canning's, but there are still fewer who, as\r\nGovernors or Viceroys, have had to deal with such an overwhelming\r\ncrisis as the Mutiny. While the want of appreciation Lord Canning at\r\nfirst displayed of the magnitude of that crisis may, with perfect\r\njustice, be attributed to the fact that most of his advisers had\r\ngained their experience only in Lower Bengal, and had therefore a very\r\nimperfect knowledge of popular feeling throughout India, the very\r\nlarge measure of success which attended his subsequent action was\r\nundoubtedly due to his own ability and sound judgment.\r\n\r\nThat by none of Lord Canning's responsible councillors could the\r\nextent of the Mutiny, or the position in Upper India, have been\r\ngrasped, was evident from the telegram[6] sent from Calcutta to the\r\nCommander-in-Chief on the 31st May, three weeks after the revolt at\r\nMeerut had occurred; but from the time Lord Canning left Calcutta\r\nin January, 1858, and had the opportunity of seeing and judging for\r\nhimself, all that he did was wise and vigorous.\r\n\r\nOutwardly Lord Canning was cold and reserved, the result, I think, of\r\nextreme sensitiveness; for he was without doubt very warm-hearted,\r\nand was greatly liked and respected by those about him, and there\r\nwas universal regret throughout India when, three months after his\r\ndeparture, the news of his death was received.\r\n\r\nWe returned to Simla early in April. The season passed much as other\r\nseasons had passed, except that there was rather more gaiety. The new\r\nViceroy remained in Calcutta; but Sir Hugh Rose had had quite enough\r\nof it the year before, so he came up to the Hills, and established\r\nhimself at 'Barnes Court.' He was very hospitable, and having my\r\nsister-in-law to chaperon, my wife went out rather more than she had\r\ncared to do in previous years. We spent a good deal of our time also\r\nat Mashobra, a lovely place, in the heart of the Hills, about six\r\nmiles from Simla, where the Chief had a house, which he was good\r\nenough to frequently place at our disposal, when not making use of\r\nit himself. It was an agreeable change, and one which we all greatly\r\nenjoyed. But at the best one gets very tired of the Hills by the close\r\nof the summer, and I was glad to start off towards the end of\r\nOctober with my wife and her sister for Agra, where this year the\r\nHead-Quarters camp was to be formed, as the Chief had settled the\r\ncold-weather tour was to begin with a march through Bundelkand and\r\nCentral India, the theatre of his successful campaign.\r\n\r\nThe second march out we were startled by being told, when we awoke\r\nin the morning, that Colonel Gawler, the Deputy-Adjutant-General of\r\nQueen's troops, had been badly wounded in the night by a thief, who\r\ngot into his tent with the object of stealing a large sum of money\r\nGawler had received from the bank the previous day, and for greater\r\nsafety had placed under his pillow when he went to bed. In the middle\r\nof the night his wife awoke him, saying there was someone in the tent,\r\nand by the dim light of a small oil-lamp he could just see a dark\r\nfigure creeping along the floor. He sprang out of bed and seized the\r\nrobber; but the latter, being perfectly naked and oiled all over,\r\nslipped through his hands and wriggled under the wall of the tent.\r\nGawler caught him by the leg just as he was disappearing, and they\r\nstruggled outside together. When despairing of being able to make his\r\nescape, the thief stabbed Gawler several times with a knife, which was\r\ntied by a string to his wrist. By this time Mrs. Gawler had been\r\nable to arouse two Kaffir servants, one of whom tried to seize the\r\nmiscreant, but in his turn was stabbed. The second servant, however,\r\nwas more wary, and succeeded in capturing the thief; Kaffir fashion,\r\nhe knocked all the breath out of his body by running at him head\r\ndown and butting him in the stomach, when it became easy to bind the\r\nmiscreant hand and foot. It was a bad part of the country for thieves;\r\nand when some four weeks later I went off on a flying tour with the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, I did not leave my wife quite as happily as usual.\r\nBut neither she nor her sister was afraid. Each night they sent\r\neverything at all valuable to be placed under the care of the guard,\r\nand having taken this precaution, were quite easy in their minds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EARL CANNING, K.G., G.C.B., G.M.S.I., VICEROY AND\r\nGOVERNOR-GENERAL OF INDIA,\r\n_From a photograph by Messrs. Mayall._]\r\n\r\nWhen the camp reached Gwalior, the Maharaja Sindhia seemed to think\r\nhe could not do enough to show his gratitude to Sir Hugh Rose for his\r\nopportune help in June, 1858,[7] when the Gwalior troops mutinied, and\r\njoined the rebel army under the Rani of Jhansi and Tantia Topi. The\r\nday after our arrival Sindhia held a grand review of his new army in\r\nhonour of our Chief. The next day there was an open-air entertainment\r\nin the Phulbagh (garden of flowers); the third a picnic and elephant\r\nfight, which, by the way, was a very tame affair. We had nerved\r\nourselves to see something rather terrific, instead of which the great\r\ncreatures twisted their trunks about each other in quite a playful\r\nmanner, and directly the play seemed to be turning into earnest they\r\nwere separated by their _mahouts_, being much too valuable to be\r\nallowed to injure themselves. Each day there was some kind of\r\nentertainment: pig-sticking or shooting expeditions in the morning,\r\nand banquets, fireworks, and illuminations in the evening.\r\n\r\nGwalior is an interesting place. The fort is picturesquely situated\r\nabove a perpendicular cliff; the road up to it is very steep, and it\r\nmust have been almost impregnable in former days. It was made doubly\r\ninteresting to us by Sir Hugh Rose explaining how he attacked it, and\r\npointing out the spot where the Rani of Jhansi was killed in a charge\r\nof the 8th Hussars.\r\n\r\nOur next halt was Jhansi. Here also Sir Hugh had a thrilling tale to\r\ntell of its capture, and of his having to fight the battle of the\r\nBetwa against a large force brought to the assistance of the rebels by\r\nTantia Topi, while the siege was actually being carried on.\r\n\r\nFrom Jhansi the big camp marched to Lucknow, _viâ_ Cawnpore; while the\r\nChief with a small staff (of which I was one) and light tents, made\r\na detour by Saugor, Jubbulpur, and Allahabad. We travelled through\r\npretty jungle for the most part, interspersed with low hills, and we\r\nhad altogether a very enjoyable trip. Sir Hugh was justly proud of the\r\nsplendid service the Central India Field Force had performed under\r\nhis command; and, as we rode along, it delighted him to point out the\r\nvarious places where he had come in contact with the rebels.\r\n\r\nWhile at Allahabad, on the 13th January--quite the coolest time of the\r\nyear--I had a slight sunstroke, which it took me a very long time to\r\nget over completely. The sensible custom introduced by Lord Clyde,\r\nof wearing helmets, was not always adhered to, and Sir Hugh Hose was\r\nrather fond of cocked hats. On this occasion I was wearing this--for\r\nIndia--most unsuitable head-dress, and, as ill-luck would have it, the\r\nChief kept me out rather late, going over the ground where the present\r\ncantonment stands. I did not feel anything at the time, but an hour\r\nlater I was suddenly seized with giddiness and sickness, and for a\r\nshort time I could neither see nor hear. Plentiful douches of cold\r\nwater brought me round, and I was well enough in the afternoon to go\r\nwith the Chief to inspect the fort; but for months afterwards I never\r\nlost the pain in my head, and for many years I was very susceptible to\r\nthe evil influence of the sun's rays.\r\n\r\nWe reached Lucknow towards the middle of January. Here, as elsewhere,\r\nwe had constant parades and inspections, for Sir Hugh carried out his\r\nduties in the most thorough manner, and spared himself no trouble to\r\nsecure the efficiency and the well-being of the soldier. At the same\r\ntime, he was careful not to neglect his social duties; he took a\r\nprominent part in all amusements, and it was mainly due to his liberal\r\nsupport that we were able to keep up a small pack of hounds with\r\nHead-Quarters, which afforded us much enjoyment during the winter\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nFrom Lucknow we marched through Bareilly, Meerut, and Umballa, and the\r\n30th March saw us all settled at Simla for the season.\r\n\r\nEarly in April Lord Elgin arrived in Simla for the hot weather,\r\nand from that time to the present, Simla has continued to be the\r\nHead-Quarters of the Government during the summer months.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the changes necessitated by the amalgamation of\r\nthe services took place in the army staff. Edwin Johnson lost his\r\nappointment in consequence, and Colonel Haythorne,[8] Adjutant-General\r\nof Queen's troops, became Adjutant-General of the Army in India,\r\nwith Donald Stewart as his deputy. The order limiting the tenure of\r\nemployment on the staff in the same grade to five years was also now\r\nintroduced, which entailed my good friend Arthur Becher vacating the\r\nQuartermaster-Generalship, after having held it for eleven years.\r\nHe was succeeded by Colonel Paton, with Lumsden as his deputy, and\r\nCharles Johnson (brother of Edwin Johnson) and myself as assistants in\r\nthe Department.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Under the Regular system, which was modelled on the Royal\r\nArmy organization, each regiment of Native Cavalry had 22, and each\r\nregiment of Native Infantry 25 British officers, who rose to the\r\nhigher grades by seniority. From this establishment officers were\r\ntaken, without being seconded, for the multifarious extra-regimental\r\nduties on which the Indian Army was, and is still, employed, viz.,\r\nStaff, Civil, Political, Commissariat, Pay, Public Works, Stud,\r\nand Survey. With the Irregular system this was no longer possible,\r\nalthough the number of British officers with each corps was (after\r\nthe Mutiny) increased from 3 to 9 with a Cavalry, and 3 to 8 with an\r\nInfantry regiment.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Captain after twelve years,[*] Major after twenty years,\r\nand Lieutenant-Colonel after twenty-six years.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote * to Footnote 2: Since reduced to eleven years.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The late Sir Bartle Frere, Bart, G.C.B., G.C.S.I.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The fever-giving tract of country at the foot of the\r\nHimalayas.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Native string bed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: 'Your force of Artillery will enable us to dispose\r\nof Delhi with certainty.

Sir Hugh Rose at once\r\ncancelled his leave, pushed on to Gwalior, and by the 30th of June had\r\nre-captured all Sindhia's guns and placed him again in possession of\r\nhis capital.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: The late General Sir Edmund Haythorne, K.C.B.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n1863\r\n\r\n  The Umbeyla expedition--The Akhund of Swat\r\n  --The 'Eagle's Nest' and 'Crag piquet'--The death of Lord Elgin\r\n  --Loyalty of our Pathan soldiers--Bunerwals show signs of submission\r\n  --The conical hill--Umbeyla in flames--Bunerwals agree to our terms\r\n  --Malka destroyed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1863, while we were preparing for the usual winter\r\ntour, Sir Hugh Rose, who had accompanied Lord Elgin on a trip through\r\nthe hills, telegraphed to the Head-Quarters staff to join him at Mian\r\nMir without delay.\r\n\r\nThe news which greeted us on our arrival was indeed disturbing. Lord\r\nElgin was at Dharmsala in a dying condition, and the Chief had\r\nbeen obliged to leave him and push on to Lahore, in consequence of\r\nunsatisfactory reports from Brigadier-General Chamberlain, who was\r\njust then commanding an expedition which had been sent into the\r\nmountains near Peshawar, and had met with unexpected opposition. The\r\ncivil authorities on the spot reported that there existed a great deal\r\nof excitement all along the border, that the tribes were collecting in\r\nlarge numbers, that emissaries from Kabul had appeared amongst\r\nthem, and that, unless reinforcements could be sent up at once, the\r\nGovernment would be involved in a war which must inevitably lead to\r\nthe most serious complications, not only on the frontier, but with\r\nAfghanistan. In so grave a light did the Lieutenant-Governor, Sir\r\nRobert Montgomery, view the position, that he contemplated the force\r\nbeing withdrawn and the undertaking abandoned.\r\n\r\nSir Hugh had had nothing to do with the despatch of this expedition;\r\nit had been decided on by the Government of India in consultation with\r\nthe Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab. When the Commander-in-Chief was\r\ncommunicated with, he expressed himself adverse to the proposal, and\r\nplaced his views at length before the Government, pointing out the\r\ninexpediency of entering a difficult and unknown country, unless the\r\ntroops were properly equipped with transport, supplies, and reserve\r\nammunition; that time did not permit of their being so equipped before\r\nthe winter set in; and that, to provide a force of 5,000 men (the\r\nstrength considered necessary by the Government), the frontier would\r\nhave to be dangerously weakened. Moreover, he gave it as his opinion\r\nthat it would be better to postpone operations until the spring, when\r\neverything could be perfectly arranged. Subsequent events proved how\r\nsound was this advice. But before proceeding with my narrative it will\r\nbe as well to explain the circumstances with led the authorities to\r\nundertake this expedition.\r\n\r\nIn 1857, when all our resources were required to quell internal\r\ntumult, the Hindustani fanatics[1] took the opportunity to stir up\r\ndisturbances all along the Yusafzai frontier of the Peshawar district,\r\nand, aided by the rebel sepoys who had fled to them for protection,\r\nthey made raids upon our border, and committed all kinds of\r\natrocities. We were obliged, therefore, to send an expedition against\r\nthem in 1858, which resulted in their being driven from their\r\nstronghold, Sitana, and in the neighbouring tribes being bound down to\r\nprevent them reoccupying that place. Three years later the fanatics\r\nreturned to their former haunts and built up a new settlement at\r\nMalka; the old troubles recommenced, and for two years they had been\r\nallowed to go on raiding, murdering, and attacking our outposts with\r\nimpunity. It was, therefore, quite time that measures should be taken\r\nto effectually rid the frontier of these disturbers of the peace,\r\nprovided such measures could have been decided upon early enough in\r\nthe year to ensure success.\r\n\r\nThe Punjab Government advocated the despatch of a very strong force.\r\nAccordingly, two columns were employed, the base of one being in the\r\nPeshawar valley, and that of the other in Hazara. The Peshawar column\r\nwas to move by the Umbeyla Pass, the Buner frontier, and the Chamla\r\nvalley, thus operating on the enemy's line of retreat. This route\r\nwould not have been chosen, had not Chamberlain been assured by the\r\ncivil authorities that no hostility need be feared from the Bunerwals,\r\neven if their country had to be entered, as they had given no trouble\r\nfor fifteen years, and their spiritual head, the Akhund of Swat,[2]\r\nhad no sympathy with the fanatics. It was not, therefore, considered\r\nnecessary to warn the Buner people of our approach until preparations\r\nwere completed; indeed, it was thought unadvisable to do so, as it was\r\nimportant to keep the proposed line of advance secret. The strength of\r\nthe force was 6,000 men, with 19 guns, but to make up these numbers\r\nthe stations in Upper India had to be considerably weakened, and there\r\nwas no reserve nearer than Lahore.\r\n\r\nThe Peshawar column[3] being all ready for a start, a Proclamation was\r\nforwarded to the Buner and other neighbouring tribes, informing\r\nthem of the object of the expedition, and stating that there was no\r\nintention of interfering with them or their possessions.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning, the 20th October, the Umbeyla Pass was\r\nentered, and by noon the kotal[4] was reached without any resistance\r\nto speak of; but, from information brought in, it was evident that any\r\nfurther advance would be stoutly opposed. The road turned out to be\r\nmuch more difficult than had been anticipated, and the hurriedly\r\ncollected transport proved unequal to the strain. Not a single baggage\r\nanimal, except the ammunition mules, got up that night; indeed, it was\r\nnot until the morning of the 22nd--more than forty-eight hours after\r\nthey started--that the rear guard reached the kotal, a distance of\r\nonly six miles. As soon as it arrived Colonel Alex. Taylor, R.E., was\r\nsent off with a body of Cavalry, under Lieutenant-Colonel Probyn, to\r\nreconnoitre the road in front. The delay in reaching the top of the\r\npass had given the tribes time to collect, and when the reconnoitring\r\nparty entered the Chamla valley the Bunerwals could be seen about two\r\nmiles and a half off, occupying in force the range which separates\r\nBuner and Chamla. Whatever may have been their first intention, they\r\napparently could not resist the temptation to try and cut off this\r\nsmall body of Cavalry, for our horsemen on their return journey found\r\na large number of the trusted Buner tribe attempting to block the\r\nmouth of the pass. A charge was made, but mounted men could not do\r\nmuch in such a hilly country; the proceedings of the Bunerwals,\r\nhowever, had been observed from the kotal, and Major Brownlow,[5] with\r\nsome of his own regiment (the 20th Punjab Infantry), was sent to the\r\nassistance of the party. A hand-to-hand fight ensued, and the enemy\r\npressed our troops closely on their way back, coming right in amongst\r\nthem with the utmost daring.\r\n\r\nThere was now brought in to the Commissioner by a spy the copy of\r\na letter from the Hindustani fanatics, addressed to the Bunerwals,\r\ntelling them not to be taken in by our assurances that our only object\r\nwas to punish the fanatics, for our real intentions were to annex\r\nChamla, Buner, and Swat. This letter no doubt aroused the suspicions\r\nof the tribes, and, encouraged by the slowness of our movements, they\r\nall joined against us from Buner, Mahaban, and the Black Mountain.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd large bodies of men with numerous standards were to be\r\nseen approaching the mouth of the pass, and a day or two later a\r\nreport was received that our foes were to have the support of the\r\nAkhund of Swat, which meant a most formidable accession of moral as\r\nwell as material strength, and put a stop, for the time being, to\r\nany possibility of a successful advance being made with the force at\r\nChamberlain's disposal.\r\n\r\nThe position occupied by our troops was enclosed on the left (west)\r\nby the Guru Mountain, which separates Umbeyla from Buner, and on the\r\nright (east) by a range of hills, not quite so high. The main piquet\r\non the Guru occupied a position upon some precipitous cliffs known as\r\nthe Eagle's Nest, while that on the right was designated the 'Crag\r\npiquet.' The Eagle's Nest was only large enough to accommodate 110\r\nmen, so 120 more were placed under the shelter of some rocks at its\r\nbase, and the remainder of the troops told off for the defence of the\r\nleft piquet were drawn up on and about a rocky knoll, 400 feet west of\r\nthe Eagle's Nest.\r\n\r\nSome 2,000 of the enemy occupied a breastwork on the crest of a spur\r\nof the Guru Mountain; and about noon on the 26th they moved down, and\r\nwith loud shouts attacked the Eagle's Nest. Their matchlock men posted\r\nthemselves to the greatest advantage in a wood, and opened a galling\r\nfire upon our defences, while their swordsmen made a determined\r\nadvance. The nature of the ground prevented our guns from being\r\nbrought to bear upon the assailants, and they were thus able to\r\nget across the open space in front of the piquet, and plant their\r\nstandards close under its parapet. For some considerable time they\r\nremained in this position, all our efforts to dislodge them proving of\r\nno avail. Eventually, however, they were forced to give way, and were\r\ndriven up the hill, leaving the ground covered with their dead, and a\r\ngreat many wounded, who were taken into our hospitals and carefully\r\ntreated, while a still greater number were carried off by their\r\nfriends. Our losses were, 2 British officers, 1 Native officer, and\r\n26 men killed; and 2 British officers, 7 Native officers, and 86 men\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nThe day following the fight the Bunerwals were told they might carry\r\naway their dead, and we took advantage of their acceptance of this\r\npermission to reason with them as to the uselessness of an unnecessary\r\nsacrifice of their tribesmen, which would be the certain result of\r\nfurther opposition to us. Their demeanour was courteous, and they\r\nconversed freely with General Chamberlain and Colonel Reynell Taylor,\r\nthe Commissioner, but they made it evident that they were determined\r\nnot to give in.\r\n\r\nOur position had now become rather awkward; there was a combination\r\nagainst us of all the tribes between the Indus and the Kabul rivers,\r\nand their numbers could not be less than 15,000 armed men. Mutual\r\nanimosities were for the time allowed to remain in abeyance, and\r\nthe tribes all flocked to fight under the Akhund's standard in the\r\ninterests of their common faith. Moreover, there was trouble in the\r\nrear from the people along the Yusafzai border, who assisted the\r\nenemy by worrying our lines of communication. Under these changed\r\nconditions, and with such an inadequate force, Chamberlain came to\r\nthe conclusion that, for the moment, he could only remain on the\r\ndefensive, and trust to time, to the discouragement which repeated\r\nunsuccessful attacks were sure to produce on the enemy, and to the\r\ngradual decrease of their numbers, to break up the combination against\r\nus; for, as these tribesmen only bring with them the quantity of food\r\nthey are able to carry, as soon as it is finished they are bound to\r\nsuspend operations till more can be procured.\r\n\r\nFor three weeks almost daily attacks were made on our position; the\r\nenemy fought magnificently, some of them being killed inside our\r\nbatteries, and twice they gained possession of the 'Crag piquet,' the\r\nkey of the position, which it was essential should be retaken at all\r\nhazards. On the second occasion General Chamberlain himself led the\r\nattacking party, and was so severely wounded that he was obliged to\r\nrelinquish the command of the force.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab, being convinced that\r\nreinforcements were necessary, in consultation with Colonels Durand[6]\r\nand Norman (the Foreign and Military Secretaries, who had come to\r\nLahore to meet the Viceroy), and without waiting for the sanction of\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief, ordered to the frontier the three regiments\r\nwhich had been detailed for the Viceroy's camp,[7] as well as the 93rd\r\nHighlanders, then at Sialkot; and when Sir Hugh Rose on his arrival\r\nat Lahore heard of the heavy losses the expeditionary force had\r\nsustained, and of General Chamberlain being _hors de combat_ from his\r\nwound, further reinforcements from every direction were hurried to the\r\nfront. Subsequently, however, it became a question whether the troops\r\nshould not be withdrawn altogether, and the punishment of the fanatics\r\ngiven up, the Government of India and the Punjab Government being\r\ncompletely in accord in favouring this view, while the Commissioner of\r\nPeshawar, Major James (who had succeeded Reynell Taylor),[8] and Sir\r\nHugh Rose were as strongly opposed to a retrograde movement. The\r\nCommander-in-Chief pointed out to the Government that the loss of\r\nprestige and power we must sustain by retiring from the Umbeyla Pass\r\nwould be more disastrous, both from a military and political point\r\nof view, than anything that could happen save the destruction of the\r\nforce itself, and that General Chamberlain, on whose sound judgment he\r\ncould rely, was quite sure that a retirement was unnecessary.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately at this time the Viceroy died at Dharmsala, and the\r\nquestion remained in abeyance pending the arrival of Sir William\r\nDenison, Governor of Madras, who was coming round to take over the\r\nreins of Government until a successor to Lord Elgin should be sent\r\nfrom England.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Sir Hugh Rose was most anxious to obtain exact\r\ninformation respecting our position at Umbeyla, the means of operating\r\nfrom it, the nature of the ground--in fact, all details which could\r\nonly be satisfactorily obtained by sending someone to report on the\r\nsituation, with whom he had had personal communication regarding\r\nthe points about which he required to be enlightened. He therefore\r\ndetermined to despatch two officers on special service, whose duty it\r\nwould be to put the Commander-in-Chief in possession of all the facts\r\nof the case; accordingly, Colonel Adye[9] (Deputy-Adjutant-General\r\nof Royal Artillery) and I were ordered to proceed to Umbeyla without\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\nAdye proved a most charming travelling companion, clever and\r\nentertaining, and I think we both enjoyed our journey. We reached the\r\npass on the 25th November.\r\n\r\nThere had been no fighting for some days, and most of the wounded had\r\nbeen removed. Sir Neville Chamberlain was still in camp, and I was\r\nsorry to find him suffering greatly from his wound. We were much\r\ninterested in going over the piquets and listening to the story of the\r\ndifferent attacks made upon them, which had evidently been conducted\r\nby the enemy with as much skill as courage.[10] The loyalty of our\r\nNative soldiers struck me as having been most remarkable. Not a single\r\ndesertion had occurred, although all the Native regiments engaged,\r\nwith the exception of the Gurkhas and Punjab Pioneers, had amongst\r\nthem members of the several tribes we were fighting, and many of our\r\nsoldiers were even closely related to some of the hostile tribesmen;\r\non one occasion a young Buner sepoy actually recognized his own father\r\namongst the enemy's dead when the fight was over.[11]\r\n\r\nWe listened to many tales of the gallantry of the British officers.\r\nThe names of Brownlow, Keyes,[12] and Hughes[13] were on everyone's\r\nlips, and Brownlow's defence of the Eagle's Nest on the 26th October,\r\nand of the 'Crag piquet' on the 12th November, spoke volumes for his\r\ncoolness and pluck, and for the implicit faith reposed in him by the\r\nmen of the 20th Punjab Infantry, the regiment he had raised in 1857\r\nwhen but a subaltern. In his official report the General remarked that\r\n'to Major Brownlow's determination and personal example he attributed\r\nthe preservation of the \"Crag piquet.\"' And Keyes's recapture of the\r\nsame piquet was described by Sir Neville as 'a most brilliant exploit,\r\nstamping Major Keyes as an officer possessing some of the highest\r\nmilitary qualifications.' Brownlow and Keyes were both recommended for\r\nthe Victoria Cross.\r\n\r\nWe (Adye and I) had no difficulty in making up our minds as to\r\nthe course which ought to be taken. The column was daily being\r\nstrengthened by the arrival of reinforcements, and although the\r\ncombination of the tribesmen was still formidable, the enemy were\r\nshowing signs of being disheartened by their many losses, and of a\r\nwish to come to terms.\r\n\r\nHaving consulted the civil and military authorities on the spot, we\r\ninformed the Commander-in-Chief that they were of opinion a withdrawal\r\nwould be most unwise, and that it was hoped that on the arrival of\r\nGeneral Garvock[14] (Chamberlain's successor) an advance would be made\r\ninto the Chamla valley, for there would then be a sufficient number\r\nof troops to undertake an onward move, as well as to hold the present\r\nposition, which, as we told the Chief, was one of the strongest we had\r\never seen.\r\n\r\nSir William Denison reached Calcutta on the 2nd December. A careful\r\nstudy of the correspondence in connexion with the Umbeyla expedition\r\nsatisfied him that the Commander-in-Chief's views were correct, and\r\nthat a retirement would be unwise.\r\n\r\nSir Hugh Rose had previously requested to be allowed to personally\r\nconduct the operations, and in anticipation of the Government acceding\r\nto his request, he had sent a light camp to Hasan Abdal, from which\r\nplace he intended to push on to Umbeyla; and with the object of\r\ncollecting troops near the frontier, where they would be available\r\nas a reserve should the expedition not be soon and satisfactorily\r\nsettled, he desired me to select an encamping-ground between Rawal\r\nPindi and Attock suitable for 10,000 men.\r\n\r\nLeaving Adye in the pass, I started for Attock, where I spent three\r\ndays riding about in search of a promising site for the camp. I\r\nsettled upon a place near Hasan Abdal, which, however, was not in the\r\nend made use of. The people of the country were very helpful to me;\r\nindeed, when they heard I had been a friend of John Nicholson, they\r\nseemed to think they could not do enough for me, and delighted in\r\ntalking of their old leader, whom they declared to be the greatest man\r\nthey had ever known.\r\n\r\nOn my return I marched up the pass with the Rev. W. G. Cowie[15] and\r\nProbyn, who, with 400 Cavalry, had been ordered to the front to be in\r\nreadiness for a move into the Chamla valley. James, the Commissioner,\r\nhad been working to detach the Bunerwals from the combination against\r\nus, and on the afternoon of our arrival a deputation of their headmen\r\narrived in camp, and before their departure the next morning they\r\npromised to accompany a force proceeding to destroy Malka, and to\r\nexpel the Hindustani fanatics from the Buner country.\r\n\r\nLater, however, a messenger came in to say they could not fulfil their\r\npromise, being unable to resist the pressure brought to bear upon them\r\nby their co-religionists. The man further reported that large numbers\r\nof fresh tribesmen had appeared on the scene, and that it was intended\r\nto attack us on the 16th. He advised the Commissioner to take the\r\ninitiative, and gave him to understand that if we advanced the\r\nBunerwals would stand aloof.\r\n\r\nSir Hugh Rose had been accorded permission to take command of the\r\ntroops in the field, and had sent word to General Garvock not 'to\r\nattempt any operations until further orders.' James, however, thinking\r\nthat the situation demanded immediate action, as disturbances had\r\nbroken out in other parts of the Peshawar valley, deprecated delay,\r\nand pressed Garvock to advance, telling him that a successful\r\nfight would put matters straight. Garvock consented to follow the\r\nCommissioner's advice, and arranged to move on the following day.\r\n\r\nThe force was divided into three columns. The first and\r\nsecond--consisting of about 4,800 men, and commanded respectively by\r\nColonel W. Turner, C.B.,[16] and Lieutenant-Colonel Wilde, C.B.--were\r\nto form the attacking party, while the third, about 3,000 strong,\r\nunder the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Vaughan,[17] was to be left\r\nfor the protection of the camp.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak, on the 15th, the troops for the advance, unencumbered by\r\ntents or baggage, and each man carrying two days' rations, assembled\r\nat the base of the 'Crag piquet.' Turner, an excellent officer, who\r\nduring the short time he had been at Umbeyla had inspired great\r\nconfidence by his soldierly qualities, had on the previous afternoon\r\nreconnoitred to the right of the camp, and had discovered that\r\nabout 4,000 men were holding the village of Lalu, from which it was\r\nnecessary to dislodge them before Umbeyla could be attacked. On being\r\ntold to advance, therefore, Turner moved off in the direction of Lalu,\r\nand, driving the enemy's piquets before him, occupied the heights\r\noverlooking the valley, out of which rose, immediately in front about\r\n200 yards off, a conical hill which hid Lalu from view. This hill,\r\nwhich was crowded with Hindustani fanatics and their Pathan allies,\r\nwas a most formidable position; the sides were precipitous, and the\r\nsummit was strengthened by _sangars_.[18] No further move could be\r\nmade until the enemy were dislodged, so Turner lined the heights all\r\nround with his Infantry, and opened fire with his Mountain guns.\r\nMeanwhile, Wilde's column had cleared off the enemy from the front\r\nof the camp, and formed up on Turner's left. On the advance being\r\nsounded, Turner's Infantry rushed down the slopes, and in ten minutes\r\ncould be seen driving the enemy from the heights on his right; at the\r\nsame time the 101st Fusiliers, the leading regiment of Wilde's column,\r\nmade straight for the top of the conical hill, and, under cover of\r\nthe fire from the Mountain guns of both columns, and supported by\r\nthe Guides, 4th Gurkhas, and 23rd Pioneers, they climbed the almost\r\nperpendicular sides. When near the top a short halt was made to give\r\nthe men time to get their breath; the signal being then given, amidst\r\na shower of bullets and huge stones, the position was stormed, and\r\ncarried at the point of the bayonet. It was a grand sight as Adye and\r\nI watched it from Hughes's battery; but we were considerably relieved\r\nwhen we perceived the enemy flying down the sides of the hill, and\r\nheard the cheers of the gallant Fusiliers as they stood victorious on\r\nthe highest peak.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STORMING OF THE CONICAL HILL AT UMBEYLA BY THE\r\n101ST FOOT (BENGAL FUSILIERS).\r\n_From a sketch by General Sir John Adye, G.C.B., R.A._]\r\n\r\nNow that the enemy were on the run it was the time to press them, and\r\nthis Turner did so effectually that the leading men of his column\r\nentered Lalu simultaneously with the last of the fugitives. The\r\nrapidity of this movement was so unexpected that it threw the enemy\r\ninside the walls into confusion; they made no stand, and were soon in\r\nfull retreat towards Umbeyla and the passes leading into Buner.\r\n\r\nWhile affairs were thus prospering on our right, the enemy, apparently\r\nimagining we were too busy to think of our left, came in large\r\nnumbers from the village of Umbeyla, threatening the camp and the\r\ncommunications of the second column. Wilde, however, was prepared for\r\nthem, and held his ground until reinforced by Turner, when he made a\r\nforward movement. The Guides, and detachments of the 5th Gurkhas and\r\n3rd Sikhs, charged down one spur, and the 101st down another; the\r\nenemy were driven off with great slaughter, leaving a standard in\r\nthe hands of the Gurkhas, and exposing themselves in their flight to\r\nTurner's guns. During the day they returned, and, gathering on the\r\nheights, made several unsuccessful attacks upon our camp. At last,\r\nabout 2 p.m., Brownlow, who was in command of the right defences,\r\nassumed the offensive, and, aided by Keyes, moved out of the\r\nbreastworks and, by a succession of well-executed charges, completely\r\ncleared the whole front of the position, and drove the tribesmen with\r\ngreat loss into the plain below.\r\n\r\nAll opposition having now ceased, and the foe being in full retreat,\r\nthe force bivouacked for the night. We had 16 killed and 67 wounded;\r\nwhile our opponents admitted to 400 killed and wounded.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we were joined by Probyn with 200 sabres of the 11th\r\nBengal Lancers and the same number of the Guides; and after a hasty\r\nbreakfast the order was given to march into the Chamla valley. My duty\r\nwas to accompany the Mountain batteries and show them the way. As we\r\ndebouched into comparatively open country, the enemy appeared on a\r\nridge which completely covered our approach to Umbeyla, and we could\r\ndescry many standards flying on the most prominent points. The road\r\nwas so extremely difficult that it was half-past two o'clock before\r\nthe whole force was clear of the hills.\r\n\r\nGeneral Garvock, having made a careful reconnaissance of the enemy's\r\nposition, which was of great strength and peculiarly capable of\r\ndefence, had decided to turn their right, a movement which was to be\r\nentrusted to the second column, and I was told to inform Turner that\r\nhe must try and cut them off from the Buner Pass as they retreated.\r\nI found Turner close to Umbeyla and delivered my message. He moved\r\nforward at once with the 23rd Pioneers and a wing of the 32nd Pioneers\r\nin line, supported by the second wing, having in reserve a wing of the\r\n7th Royal Fusiliers.\r\n\r\nWhen we had passed the village of Umbeyla, which was in flames, having\r\nbeen set fire to by our Cavalry, the wing of the 32nd was brought up\r\nin prolongation of our line to the right. The advance was continued\r\nto within about 800 yards of the Buner Pass, when Turner, observing a\r\nlarge body of the enemy threatening his left flank, immediately sent\r\ntwo companies of the Royal Fusiliers in that direction. Just at that\r\nmoment a band of _Ghazis_ furiously attacked the left flank, which\r\nwas at a disadvantage, having got into broken ground covered with low\r\njungle. In a few seconds five of the Pioneer British officers were\r\non the ground, one killed and four wounded; numbers of the men were\r\nknocked over, and the rest, staggered by the suddenness of the\r\nonslaught, fell back on their reserve, where they found the needed\r\nsupport, for the Fusiliers stood as firm as a rock. At the\r\ncritical moment when the _Ghazis_ made their charge, Wright, the\r\nAssistant-Adjutant-General, and I, being close by, rushed in amongst\r\nthe Pioneers and called on them to follow us; as we were personally\r\nknown to the men of both regiments, they quickly pulled themselves\r\ntogether and responded to our efforts to rally them. It was lucky they\r\ndid so, for had there been any delay or hesitation, the enemy, who\r\nthronged the slopes above us, would certainly have come down in great\r\nnumbers, and we should have had a most difficult task. As it was, we\r\nwere entirely successful in repulsing the _Ghazis_, not a man of\r\nwhom escaped. We counted 200 of the enemy killed; our losses were\r\ncomparatively slight--8 killed and 80 wounded.\r\n\r\nWe bivouacked for the night near the village of Umbeyla, and the next\r\nmorning the Bunerwals, who, true to their word, had taken no part in\r\nthe fighting on the 15th or 16th, came in and made their submission.\r\n\r\nThe question which now had to be decided was, whether a force fully\r\nequipped and strong enough to overcome all opposition should be sent\r\nto destroy the fanatic settlement of Malka, or whether the work of\r\nannihilation should be entrusted to the Bunerwals, witnessed by\r\nBritish officers. The latter course was eventually adopted, chiefly\r\non account of the delay which provisioning a brigade would entail--a\r\ndelay which the Commissioner was anxious to avoid--for although for\r\nthe present the combination had broken up, and most of the tribesmen\r\nwere dispersing to their homes, the Akhund of Swat and his followers\r\nwere still hovering about in the neighbourhood, and inaction on our\r\npart would in all probability have led to a fresh gathering and\r\nrenewed hostilities.\r\n\r\nThe terms which were drawn up, and to which the Bunerwals agreed,\r\nwere:\r\n\r\n    The breaking-up of the tribal gathering in the Buner Pass.\r\n\r\n    The destruction of Malka; those carrying out the work to be\r\n    accompanied by British officers and such escort as might be\r\n    considered necessary by us.\r\n\r\n    The expulsion of the Hindustanis from the Buner, Chamla, and\r\n    Amazai countries.\r\n\r\n    And, finally, it was stipulated that the headmen of their tribe\r\n    should be left as hostages until such time as the requirements\r\n    should have been fulfilled.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of Saturday, the 19th December, the little party\r\nof British officers who were to witness the destruction of Malka\r\nassembled at Umbeyla. Its members were Reynell Taylor (who was in\r\ncharge), Alex. Taylor (Commanding Engineer), two Survey officers,\r\nWright, Adye, and myself. Twenty-five Cavalry and 4 companies of the\r\nGuides Infantry, under four officers, formed our escort, and it had\r\nbeen arranged that we were to be accompanied by four leading Buner\r\nKhans, with 2,000 followers, who would be responsible for our safety,\r\nand destroy the fanatics' stronghold in our presence. Rain was falling\r\nheavily, but as all our arrangements had been made, and delay was\r\nconsidered undesirable, it was settled that we should make a start. It\r\nwas rough travelling, and it was almost dark when we reached Kuria,\r\nonly eight miles on our way, where we halted for the night, and where\r\nwe had to remain the next day, as the Bunerwals declared they could\r\nnot continue the journey until they had come to an understanding with\r\nthe Amazais, in whose territory Malka was situated.\r\n\r\nWe had noticed on leaving Umbeyla that, instead of 2,000 Bunerwals,\r\nthere were only about sixty or seventy at the most, and in reply to\r\nour repeated questions as to what had become of the remainder, we were\r\ntold they would join us later on. It soon became evident, however,\r\nthat no more were coming, and that the Khans thought it wiser to trust\r\nto their own influence with the Amazais rather than to intimidation.\r\n\r\nWe made a fresh start on the morning of the 21st. Malka was only\r\ntwelve miles off, but the way was so difficult, and our guides stopped\r\nso often to consult with the numerous bands of armed men we came\r\nacross, that it was sunset before we arrived at our destination.\r\n\r\nMalka was perched on a spur of the Mahabun mountain, some distance\r\nbelow its highest peak. It was a strong, well-built place, with\r\naccommodation for about 1,500 people. The Amazais did not attempt to\r\ndisguise their disgust at our presence in their country, and they\r\ngathered in knots, scowling and pointing at us, evidently discussing\r\nwhether we should or should not be allowed to return.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Malka was set on fire, and the huge column of smoke\r\nwhich ascended from the burning village, and was visible for miles\r\nround, did not tend to allay the ill-feeling so plainly displayed. The\r\nNative officers of the Guides warned us that delay was dangerous, as\r\nthe people were becoming momentarily more excited, and were vowing we\r\nshould never return. It was no use, however, to attempt to make a\r\nmove without the consent of the tribesmen, for we were a mere handful\r\ncompared to the thousands who had assembled around Malka, and we were\r\nseparated from our camp by twenty miles of most difficult country. Our\r\nposition was no doubt extremely critical, and it was well for us that\r\nwe had at our head such a cool, determined leader as Reynell Taylor. I\r\ngreatly admired the calm, quiet manner in which he went up and spoke\r\nto the headmen, telling them that, the object of our visit having been\r\naccomplished, we were ready to retrace our steps. At this the\r\nAmazais became still further excited. They talked in loud tones, and\r\ngesticulated in true Pathan fashion, thronging round Taylor, who stood\r\nquite alone and perfectly self-possessed in the midst of the angry and\r\ndangerous-looking multitude. At this crisis the Bunerwals came to our\r\nrescue. The most influential of the tribe, a grey-bearded warrior,\r\nwho had lost an eye and an arm in some tribal contest, forced his way\r\nthrough the rapidly increasing crowd to Taylor's side, and, raising\r\nhis one arm to enjoin silence, delivered himself as follows: 'You are\r\nhesitating whether you will allow these English to return unmolested.\r\nYou can, of course, murder them and their escort; but if you do, you\r\nmust kill us Bunerwals first, for we have sworn to protect them, and\r\nwe will do so with our lives.' This plucky speech produced a quieting\r\neffect, and taking advantage of the lull in the storm, we set out on\r\nour return journey; but evidently the tribesmen did not consider the\r\nquestion finally or satisfactorily settled, for they followed us the\r\nwhole way to Kuria. The slopes of the hills on both sides were covered\r\nwith men. Several times we were stopped while stormy discussions took\r\nplace, and once, as we were passing through a narrow defile, an armed\r\nAmazai, waving a standard above his head, rushed down towards us.\r\nFortunately for us, he was stopped by some of those less inimically\r\ndisposed; for if he had succeeded in inciting anyone to fire a single\r\nshot, the desire for blood would quickly have spread, and in all\r\nprobability not one of our party would have escaped.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd December we reached our camp in the Umbeyla Pass, when the\r\nforce, which had only been kept there till our return, retired to the\r\nplains and was broken up.\r\n\r\nDuring my absence at Umbeyla my wife remained with friends at Mian Mir\r\nfor some time, and then made her way to Peshawar, where I joined her\r\non Christmas Day. She spent one night _en route_ in Sir Hugh Rose's\r\ncamp at Hasan Abdal, and found the Chief in great excitement and very\r\nangry at such a small party having been sent to Malka, and placed at\r\nthe mercy of the tribes. He did not know that my wife had arrived, and\r\nin passing her tent she heard him say: 'It was madness, and not one\r\nof them will ever come back alive.' She was of course dreadfully\r\nfrightened. As soon as Sir Hugh heard she was in camp, he went to see\r\nher, and tried to soften down what he knew she must have heard; but\r\nhe could not conceal his apprehension; and my poor wife's anxiety was\r\nterrible, for she did not hear another word till the morning of the\r\nday I returned to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In 1825 a religious adventurer from Bareilly made his\r\nappearance on the Yusafzai frontier with about forty Hindustani\r\nfollowers, and gave out that he was a man of superior sanctity, and\r\nhad a divine command to wage a war of extermination, with the aid of\r\nall true believers, against the infidel. After studying Arabic at\r\nDelhi, he proceeded to Mecca by way of Calcutta, and during this\r\njourney his doctrines had obtained so great an ascendency over the\r\nminds of the Mahomedans of Bengal that they have ever since supplied\r\nthe colony which Syad Ahmed Shah founded in Yusafzai with money and\r\nrecruits. The Syad was eventually slain fighting against the Sikhs,\r\nbut his followers established themselves at Sitana, and in the\r\nneighbourhood of that place they continue to flourish, notwithstanding\r\nthat we have destroyed their settlements more than once during the\r\nlast forty years.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The Akhund of Swat was a man of seventy years of age at\r\nthe time of the Umbeyla expedition; he had led a holy life, and had\r\ngained such an influence over the minds of Mahomedans in general,\r\nthat they believed he was supplied by supernatural means with the\r\nnecessaries of life, and that every morning, on rising from his\r\nprayers, a sum of money sufficient for the day's expenditure was found\r\nunder his praying carpet.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The Peshawar column consisted of half of 19th Company\r\nRoyal Artillery, No. 3 Punjab Light Field Battery, the Peshawar and\r\nHazara Mountain Batteries, the 71st and 101st Foot, the Guides, one\r\ntroop 11th Bengal Lancers, one company Bengal Sappers and Miners, 14th\r\nSikhs, 20th Punjab Infantry, 32nd Pioneers, 1st, 3rd, 5th and 6th\r\nPunjab Infantry, and 4th and 5th Gurkhas.

The time was chiefly spent in inspections, parades, and\r\nfield-days, varied by an occasional run with the hounds. The hunting\r\nabout Peshawar was very fair, and we all, the Chief included, got a\r\ngreat deal of fun out of our small pack.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th January a full-dress parade was held to announce to the\r\ngarrison that Sir John Lawrence had been appointed Viceroy of India,\r\nand soon afterwards we left Peshawar and began our return march to\r\nSimla.\r\n\r\nWe changed our house this year and took one close to the Stewarts, an\r\narrangement for which I was very thankful later, when my wife had a\r\ngreat sorrow in the death of her sister, Mrs. Sladen, at Peshawar. It\r\nwas everything for her at such a time to have a kind and sympathizing\r\nfriend close at hand, when I was engaged with my work and could be\r\nvery little with her during the day. At this time, as at all others,\r\nSir Hugh Rose was a most considerate friend to us; he placed his house\r\nat Mashobra at my wife's disposal, thus providing her with a quiet\r\nresort which she frequently made use of and which she learned to love\r\nso much that, when I returned to Simla as Commander-in-Chief, her\r\nfirst thought was to secure this lovely 'Retreat' as a refuge from the\r\n(sometimes) slightly trying gaiety of Simla.\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief was good enough to send in my name for a brevet\r\nfor the Umbeyla expedition, but the Viceroy refused to forward the\r\nrecommendation, for the reason that I was 'too junior to be made a\r\nLieutenant-Colonel.' I was then thirty-two!\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole of 1864 I was more or less ill; the office work\r\n(which never suited me quite as well as more active employment) was\r\nexcessive, for, in addition to the ordinary routine, I had undertaken\r\nto revise the 'Bengal Route-Book,' which had become quite obsolete,\r\nhaving been compiled in 1837, when Kurnal was our frontier station. A\r\nvoyage round the Cape was still considered the panacea for all Indian\r\nailments, and the doctors strongly advised my taking leave to England,\r\nand travelling by that route.\r\n\r\nWe left Simla towards the end of October, and, after spending the next\r\nthree months in Calcutta, where I was chiefly employed in taking up\r\ntransports and superintending the embarkation of troops returning to\r\nEngland, I was given the command of a batch of 300 time-expired men\r\non board the _Renown_, one of Green's frigate-built ships which was\r\nchartered for their conveyance. Two hundred of the men belonged to\r\nthe 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Rifle Brigade, the remainder to the\r\nArtillery and various other corps; they had all been twelve years in\r\nthe army, and most of them were decorated for service in the Crimea\r\nand Indian Mutiny.\r\n\r\nAt the inspection parade before we embarked, a certain number of men\r\nwere brought up for punishment for various offences committed on\r\nthe way down country; none of the misdemeanours appeared to me very\r\nserious, so I determined to let the culprits off. I told the men that\r\nwe had now met for the first time and I was unwilling to commence our\r\nacquaintance by awarding punishments; we had to spend three or four\r\nmonths together, and I hoped they would show, by their good behaviour\r\nwhile under my command, that I had not made a mistake in condoning\r\ntheir transgressions. The officers seemed somewhat surprised at\r\nmy action in this matter, but I think it was proved by the men's\r\nsubsequent conduct that I had not judged them incorrectly, for they\r\nall behaved in quite an exemplary manner throughout the voyage.\r\n\r\nWe had been on board more than six weeks, when one of the crew was\r\nattacked by small pox--an untoward circumstance in a crowded ship. The\r\nsailor was placed in a boat which was hung over the ship's side, and a\r\ncabin-boy, the marks on whose face plainly showed that he had already\r\nsuffered badly from the disease, was told off to look after him. The\r\nman recovered, and there was no other case. Shortly before we reached\r\nSt. Helena, scurvy appeared amongst the troops, necessitating\r\nlime-juice being given in larger quantities, but what proved a more\r\neffectual remedy was water-cress, many sacks of which were laid in\r\nbefore we left the island.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th May, 1865, we sighted the 'Lizard,' and took a pilot on\r\nboard, who brought with him a few newspapers, which confirmed the\r\ntidings signalled to us by an American ship that the war between the\r\nFederals and Confederates was at an end. How eagerly we scanned the\r\njournals, after having heard nothing from home for four months, but\r\nthe only piece of news we found of personal interest to ourselves was\r\nthat my father had been made a K.C.B.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th May we reached Portsmouth, and landed between two showers\r\nof snow! I had a final parade of the men before leaving the ship, and\r\nI was quite sorry to say good-bye to them; some of the poor fellows\r\nwere already beginning to be anxious about their future, and to regret\r\nthat their time with the colours was over.\r\n\r\nMy father, mother, and sister came up to London to meet us, very\r\nlittle changed since I had left them six years before. I remained in\r\nEngland till March, 1866, when I returned to India, leaving my wife\r\nbehind to follow in the autumn.\r\n\r\nWhile I was at home, Sir Hugh Rose's term of the chief command in\r\nIndia came to an end, and his place had been taken by Sir William\r\nMansfield. On my arrival in Calcutta, I received orders to join the\r\nAllahabad division, and thither I proceeded. In October I went to\r\nCalcutta to meet my wife and take her to Allahabad, where we remained\r\nfor nearly a year, her first experience of a hot season in the plains,\r\nand a very bad one it was. Cholera was rife; the troops had to be sent\r\naway into camps, more or less distant from the station, all of which\r\nhad to be visited once, if not twice, daily; this kept me pretty well\r\non the move from morning till night. It was a sad time for everyone.\r\nPeople we had seen alive and well one day were dead and buried the\r\nnext; and in the midst of all this sorrow and tragedy the most\r\nirksome--because such an incongruous--part of our experience was that\r\nwe had constantly to get up entertainments, penny readings, and the\r\nlike, to amuse the men and keep their minds occupied, for if once\r\nsoldiers begin to think of the terrors of cholera they are seized with\r\npanic, and many get the disease from pure fright.\r\n\r\nMy wife usually accompanied me to the cholera camps, preferring to do\r\nthis rather than be left alone at home. On one occasion, I had just\r\ngot into our carriage after going round the hospital, when a young\r\nofficer ran after us to tell me a corporal in whom I had been much\r\ninterested was dead. The poor fellow's face was blue; the cholera\r\npanic had evidently seized him, and I said to my wife, 'He will be the\r\nnext.' I had no sooner reached home than I received a report of his\r\nhaving been seized.\r\n\r\nWe were fortunate in having at Allahabad as Chaplain the present\r\nBishop of Lahore, who, with his wife, had only lately come to India;\r\nthey never wearied in doing all that was possible for the soldiers.\r\nBishop Matthew is still one of our closest friends; his good, charming\r\nand accomplished wife, alas! died some years ago.\r\n\r\nWe remained at Allahabad until August, 1867, when we heard that a\r\nbrigade from Bengal was likely to be required to take part in an\r\nexpedition which would probably be sent from Bombay to Abyssinia for\r\nthe relief of some Europeans whom the King, Theodore, had imprisoned,\r\nand that the Mountain battery, on the strength of which my name was\r\nstill borne, would in such case be employed. I therefore thought I had\r\nbetter go to Simla, see the authorities, and arrange for rejoining\r\nmy battery, if the rumour turned out to be true. The cholera had now\r\ndisappeared, so I was at liberty to take leave, and we both looked\r\nforward to a cooler climate and a change to brighter scenes after the\r\nwretched experience we had been through. On my arrival at Simla I\r\ncalled upon the Commander-in-Chief and told him that, if my battery\r\nwas sent on service, I wished to join it and was quite ready to resign\r\nmy staff appointment.\r\n\r\nSir William Mansfield was particularly kind in his reception of me,\r\nfrom which I augured well; but I could learn nothing definite, and it\r\nwas not until quite the end of September that it was announced that\r\nColonel Donald Stewart was to have command of the Bengal Brigade\r\nwith the Abyssinian Force, and that I was to be his Assistant-\r\nQuartermaster-General. We at once hastened back to Allahabad, where\r\nwe only remained long enough to pack up what we wanted to take with\r\nus, and arrange for the disposal of our property; thence we proceeded\r\nto Calcutta, where, for the next two months, I had a busy time taking\r\nup transports and superintending the equipment of the force.\r\n\r\nI had often read and heard of the difficulties and delays experienced\r\nby troops landing in a foreign country, in consequence of their\r\nrequirements not being all shipped in the same vessels with\r\nthemselves--men in one ship, camp equipage in another, transport and\r\nfield hospital in a third, or perhaps the mules in one and their\r\npack-saddles in another; and I determined to try and prevent these\r\nmistakes upon this occasion. With Stewart's approval, I arranged that\r\neach detachment should embark complete in every detail, which resulted\r\nin the troops being landed and marched off without the least delay as\r\neach vessel reached its destination.[1]\r\n\r\nWe were living with the Stewarts in the Commander-in-Chief's quarters\r\nin Fort William, which His Excellency had placed at our disposal for\r\nthe time being. On the 1st November Calcutta was visited by the second\r\ncyclone within my experience. We had arranged to go to the opera that\r\nevening, but when it was time to start the wind was so high that there\r\nseemed every chance of the carriage being blown over before we could\r\nget there, so we decided not to attempt it. It was well we did, for\r\nthe few adventurous spirits who struggled through the storm had the\r\ngreatest difficulty in getting back to their homes. The opera-house\r\nwas unroofed before the performance was half over, and very little\r\nof the building remained standing the next day. At bedtime we still\r\nthought it was only a bad storm, but towards midnight the wind\r\nincreased to an alarming extent, and my wife awoke me, and begged me\r\nto get up, as the windows were being burst open and deluges of rain\r\ncoming in. Stewart and I tried to reclose the windows, but the thick\r\niron bars had been bent in two and forced out of their sockets; a\r\nheavy oak plate-chest and boxes, which we with much difficulty dragged\r\nacross the windows, were blown into the middle of the dining-room,\r\nlike so much cardboard, and the whole place was gradually flooded.\r\nWe were driven out of each room in turn, till at length we all took\r\nrefuge in a small box room, about ten feet wide, right in the middle\r\nof the house, where we remained the rest of the night and 'hoped for\r\nthe day.'\r\n\r\nTowards morning the wind abated, but what a scene of desolation was\r\nthat upon which we emerged! The rooms looked as if they could never be\r\nmade habitable again, and much of our property was floating about in a\r\nfoot of water.\r\n\r\nMy first thought was for the shipping, and I hurried down to the river\r\nto see how my transports had fared. Things were much better than I\r\nexpected to find them--only two had been damaged. Most fortunately the\r\ncyclone, having come from a different direction, was not accompanied\r\nby a storm-wave such as that which worked so much mischief amongst the\r\nshipping on a former occasion, but the destruction on land was even\r\ngreater: all the finest trees were torn up by the roots, a great part\r\nof the Native bazaar was levelled, and lay from two to three feet deep\r\nin water, while many houses were wholly or partly demolished. We came\r\nacross most curious sights when driving round Calcutta in the evening;\r\nsome of the houses were divided clean down the centre, one half\r\ncrumbled into a heap of ruins, the other half still standing and\r\ndisplaying, as in a doll's house, the furniture in the different\r\nstories.\r\n\r\nThe work of filling up and loading the vessels was greatly retarded,\r\nowing to a large number of cargo boats having been sunk, consequently\r\nit was the 5th December before the first transport got off; from that\r\ndate the others started in quick succession, and on the 9th January,\r\n1868, Stewart and his staff left Calcutta in the P. and O. steamer\r\n_Golconda_. The officers and men of the Mountain battery were also on\r\nboard, Captain Bogle in command, my friend Jemmy Hills in my place as\r\nsecond Captain, and Collen[2] and Disney as subalterns. Mrs. Stewart\r\nand my wife accompanied us as far as Aden, where they were left to the\r\nkind care of Major-General Russell,[3] commanding there at the time,\r\nuntil the arrival of the mail-steamer in which they were to proceed to\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd February we anchored in Annesley Bay and landed at Zula.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The average strength of the regiments was as follows:\r\n10th and 12th Bengal Cavalry, each 9 British officers, 13 Native\r\nofficers, 450 non-commissioned officers and men, 3 Native doctors, 489\r\nhorses, 322 mules, 590 followers. 21st and 23rd Punjab Infantry, each\r\n9 British officers, 16 Native officers, 736 non-commissioned officers\r\nand men, 3 Native doctors, 10 horses, 350 mules, 400 followers. I\r\nfound that six ships were required for the conveyance of a Cavalry and\r\nfour for that of an Infantry regiment; for the Mountain battery three\r\nships were necessary, and for the coolie corps (1,550 strong) four; in\r\nall twenty-seven ships, besides nine tugs. In selecting ships, care\r\nwas taken to secure those intended for Artillery or Cavalry as high\r\n'tween-decks as possible; a sufficient number of these were procurable\r\nat Calcutta, either iron clippers from Liverpool or large North\r\nAmerican built traders, with decks varying from 7 feet 6 inches to 8\r\nfeet 2 inches high. I gave the preference to wooden ships, as being\r\ncooler and more easily ventilated. The vessels taken up were each from\r\n1,000 to 1,400 tons, averaging in length from 150 to 200 feet, with a\r\nbeam varying from 30 to 35 feet, and usually they had a clear upper\r\ndeck, where from forty to fifty animals were accommodated.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Now Major-General Sir Edwin Collen, K.C.I.E., Military\r\nMember of the Governor-General's Council.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Now General Sir Edward Lechmere Russell, K.C.S.I.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n1868-1869\r\n\r\n  Sir Robert Napier to command--Defective transport\r\n  --King Theodore commits suicide--First A.Q.M.G\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will, perhaps, be as well to recall to the reader's mind that the\r\nobject of the expedition in which we were taking part was to rescue\r\nsome sixty Europeans, who, from one cause or another, had found their\r\nway to Abyssinia, and been made prisoners by the King of that country.\r\nAmongst these were four English officials, Mr. Rassam, and Captain\r\nCameron, who had at different times been the bearers of letters from\r\nQueen Victoria to King Theodore, and Lieutenant Prideaux and Dr.\r\nBlanc of the Bombay Army; the rest were chiefly French and German\r\nmissionaries, and artisans, with their wives and children. The\r\nprisoners were confined in a fort built on the Magd[=a]la plateau,\r\n9,150 feet above sea-level, and 379 miles inland from Annesley Bay.\r\n\r\nThe repeated demands of the British Government for the restoration of\r\nthe prisoners having been treated with contemptuous silence by the\r\nKing, Colonel Merewether, the Political Agent at Aden, who in July,\r\n1867, had been directed to proceed to Massowa and endeavour to obtain\r\nthe release of the captives, and to make inquiries and collect\r\ninformation in case of an expedition having to be sent, reported to\r\nthe Secretary of State that he had failed to communicate with the\r\nKing, and urged the advisability of immediate measures being taken to\r\nprepare a force in India for the punishment of Theodore and the rescue\r\nof the prisoners. Colonel Merewether added that in Abyssinia the\r\nopinion had become very general that England knew herself to be\r\ntoo weak to resent insult, and that amongst the peoples of the\r\nneighbouring countries, even so far as Aden, there was a feeling of\r\ncontemptuous surprise at the continued long-suffering endurance of the\r\nBritish Government.\r\n\r\nOn receipt of this communication, Her Majesty's Government, having\r\nexhausted all their resources for the preservation of peace,\r\ndecided to send an expedition from India under the command of\r\nLieutenant-General Sir Robert Napier, the Commander-in-Chief of the\r\nBombay Army. After carefully considering the distance along which\r\noperations would have to be prosecuted, and the necessity for holding\r\na number of detached posts, Napier gave it as his opinion that the\r\nforce should consist of not less than 12,000 men.[1]\r\n\r\nProfiting by the experience of the Crimean War, the Government was\r\ndetermined that the mobility of the force should not be hampered by\r\nwant of food and clothing. Stores of all descriptions were despatched\r\nin unstinted quantities from England, and three of the steamers in\r\nwhich they were conveyed were fitted up as hospital ships. But food,\r\nclothing, and stores, however liberally supplied, would not take the\r\narmy to Magd[=a]la without transport.\r\n\r\nThe question as to the most suitable organization for the Land\r\nTransport Corps occupied a good deal of Sir Robert Napier's attention\r\nwhile the expedition was being fitted out, and caused a considerable\r\namount of correspondence between him and the Bombay Government. The\r\nCommissary-General wished to keep the corps under his own orders, and\r\nobjected to its being given an entirely military organization. Sir\r\nRobert Napier preferred to establish the corps on an independent\r\nbasis, but was at first overruled by the Bombay Government. While\r\nacting in accordance with their orders, the Commander-in-Chief wrote:\r\n'I believe that the success of systems depends more on the men who\r\nwork them than on the systems themselves; but I cannot accept without\r\nprotest a decision to throw such a body of men as the drivers of our\r\ntransport animals will be (if we get them) on an expedition in a\r\nforeign country without a very complete organization to secure order\r\nand discipline.' Eventually Sir Robert got his own way, but much\r\nvaluable time had been lost, and the corps was organized on too small\r\na scale;[2] the officers and non-commissioned officers were not sent\r\nto Zula in sufficient time or in sufficient numbers to take charge of\r\nthe transport animals as they arrived.\r\n\r\nA compact, properly-supervised train of 2,600 mules, with serviceable,\r\nwell-fitting pack-saddles, was sent from the Punjab; and from Bombay\r\ncame 1,400 mules and ponies and 5,600 bullocks, but these numbers\r\nproving altogether inadequate to the needs of the expedition, they\r\nwere supplemented by animals purchased in Persia, Egypt, and on the\r\nshores of the Mediterranean. The men to look after them were supplied\r\nfrom the same sources, but their number, even if they had been\r\nefficient, was insufficient, and they were a most unruly and\r\nunmanageable lot. They demanded double the pay for which they had\r\nenlisted, and struck work in a body because their demand was not at\r\nonce complied with. They refused to take charge of the five mules\r\neach man was hired to look after, and when that number was reduced\r\nto three, they insisted that one should be used as a mount for the\r\ndriver. But the worst part of the whole organization, or, rather, want\r\nof organization, was that there had been no attempt to fit the animals\r\nwith pack-saddles, some of which were sent from England, some from\r\nIndia, and had to be adjusted to the mules after they had been landed\r\nin Abyssinia, where there was not an establishment to make the\r\nnecessary alterations. The consequence was that the wretched animals\r\nbecame cruelly galled, and in a few weeks a large percentage were\r\nunfit for work, and had to be sent to the sick depot.\r\n\r\nOther results of having no properly arranged transport train, and\r\nno supervision or discipline, were that mules were lost or stolen,\r\nstarved for want of food, or famished from want of water. The\r\ncondition of the unfortunate animals was such that, though they had\r\nbeen but a few weeks in the country, when they were required to\r\nproceed to Senafe, only sixty-seven miles distant, a very small\r\nproportion were able to accomplish the march; hundreds died on the\r\nway, and their carcases, quickly decomposing in the hot sun, became a\r\nfruitful source of dangerous disease to the force.\r\n\r\nOn arrival at Zula, we were told that Sir Robert Napier was at Senafe,\r\nthe first station in the Hills, and the advanced depot for supplies.\r\nWe of the Bengal brigade were somewhat disconcerted at the orders\r\nwhich awaited us, from which we learned that our brigade was to be\r\nbroken up; the troops were to proceed to the front; while Stewart was\r\nto take command at Senafe, and I myself was to remain at Zula, as\r\nsenior staff officer. The disappointment was great, but, being the\r\nlast-comer, I had no unfairness to complain of, and I had plenty\r\nto do. I spent the greater part of each day amongst the shipping,\r\nsuperintending the embarkation and disembarkation of men, animals, and\r\nstores.\r\n\r\nZula was not an attractive place of residence. The heat was\r\nintense--117° in the daytime in my tent. The allowance of fresh water\r\nwas extremely limited,[3] while the number of scorpions was quite\r\nthe reverse, and the food, at the best, was not appetizing. Few who\r\nremained there as long as I did escaped scurvy and horrible boils or\r\nsores. I was fortunate, however, in finding in charge of the transport\r\narrangements afloat, my old friend and Eton schoolfellow, George\r\nTryon,[4] to whom I owed many a good dinner, and, what I appreciated\r\neven more, many a refreshing bath on board the _Euphrates_, a\r\ntransport belonging to the British India Steam Navigation Company\r\nwhich had been fitted up for Captain Tryon and his staff. Indeed, all\r\nthe officers of the Royal Navy were most helpful and kind, and I\r\nhave a very pleasant recollection of the hospitality I received from\r\nCommodore Heath[5] and those serving under him.\r\n\r\nDuring the four months I remained at Zula, Tryon and I were constantly\r\ntogether, and I had plenty of opportunity for observing the masterly\r\nmanner in which he could grasp a situation, his intimate knowledge of\r\ndetail, and the strong hold he had over all those working with him,\r\nnot only the officers of the Royal Navy, but also the commanders of\r\nthe merchant vessels taken up as transports, and lying in Annesley\r\nBay.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th April news reached us that four days before Sir Robert\r\nNapier had successfully attacked Magd[=a]la and released the\r\nprisoners, having experienced but very slight opposition; and that\r\nKing Theodore, deserted by his army, which had apparently become\r\ntired of his brutalities, had committed suicide.[6] A few days later\r\nMajor-General Russell, who had come from Aden to take over the command\r\nat Zula, received orders to prepare for the embarkation of the force.\r\nArrangements were accordingly made to enable regiments and batteries\r\nto be embarked on board the transports told off for them directly they\r\narrived from the front--a matter of the utmost importance, both on\r\naccount of the fearful heat at Zula, and the absence of a sufficient\r\nwater-supply.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd June the Commander-in-Chief returned to Zula, and on the\r\n10th he embarked on board the old Indian marine steamer _Feroze_ for\r\nSuez. Sir Robert was good enough to ask me to accompany him, as he\r\nwished to make me the bearer of his final despatches. My work was\r\nended, the troops had all left, and as I was pretty well knocked up,\r\nI felt extremely grateful for the offer, and very proud of the great\r\nhonour the Chief proposed to confer upon me.\r\n\r\nWe reached Alexandria on the 20th June, and the next day I started in\r\nthe mail-steamer for Brindisi, arriving in London on the evening of\r\nSunday, the 28th. I received a note at my club from Edwin Johnson (who\r\nwas at that time Assistant Military Secretary to H.R.H. the Duke of\r\nCambridge), directing me to take the despatches without delay to the\r\nSecretary of State for India. I found Sir Stafford and Lady Northcote\r\nat dinner; Sir Stafford looked through the despatches, and when he had\r\nfinished reading them, he asked me to take them without delay to the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, as he knew the Duke was most anxious to see them.\r\nThere was a dinner-party, however, that night at Gloucester House,\r\nand the servant told me it was quite impossible to disturb His Royal\r\nHighness; so, placing my card on the top of the despatches, I told the\r\nman to deliver them at once, and went back to my club. I had scarcely\r\nreached it when the Duke's Aide-de-camp made his appearance and told\r\nme that he had been ordered to find me and take me back with him. The\r\nCommander-in-Chief received me very kindly, expressing regret that I\r\nhad been sent away in the first instance; and Their Royal Highnesses\r\nthe Prince and Princess of Wales, who were present, were most\r\ngracious, and asked many questions about the Abyssinian Expedition.\r\n\r\nThe next day I joined my wife, who was staying with my people at\r\nClifton, and on the 14th August, when the rewards for the\r\nAbyssinian Expedition were published, my name appeared for a brevet\r\nLieutenant-Colonelcy.\r\n\r\nI was now anxious to ascertain in what manner I was to be employed. My\r\nfive years as A.Q.M.G. were about to expire, and I thought I should\r\nlike to go back to my regiment for a time. I therefore applied for the\r\ncommand of a battery of Horse Artillery. I was told, in answer to my\r\napplication, that it was not the custom to appoint an officer who had\r\nbeen in staff employment for some time to the mounted branch, but\r\nthat, in consideration of my services, the Duke of Cambridge was\r\npleased to make an exception in my favour. I was posted to a battery\r\nat Meerut, and warned to be ready to start in an early troopship.\r\nBefore the time for our departure arrived, however, I received a\r\nletter from Lumsden, who had now become Quartermaster-General,\r\ninforming me that the Commander-in-Chief had recommended, and the\r\nGovernment had approved of, the formation of a fresh grade--that of\r\nFirst A.Q.M.G.--and that he was directed by Sir William Mansfield to\r\noffer the new appointment to me--an offer which I gratefully accepted;\r\nfor though the command of a Horse Artillery battery would have been\r\nmost congenial, this unexpected chance of five years' further staff\r\nemploy was too good to be refused.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th January, 1869, having said good-bye to those dear to us,\r\ntwo of whom I was never to see again, my wife and I, with a baby girl\r\nwho was born the previous July, embarked at Portsmouth on board the\r\ns.s. _Helvetia_, which had been taken up for the conveyance of troops\r\nto Bombay, the vessel of the Royal Navy in which we were to have\r\nsailed having suddenly broken down. The _Helvetia_ proved most\r\nunsuitable as a transport, and uncomfortable to the last degree for\r\npassengers, besides which it blew a gale the whole way to Alexandria.\r\nWe were all horribly ill, and our child caught a fatal cold. We\r\nthoroughly appreciated a change at Suez to the Indian trooper, the\r\n_Malabar_, where everything possible was done for our comfort by our\r\nkind captain (Rich, R.N.), and, indeed, by everyone on board; but,\r\nalas! our beautiful little girl never recovered the cruel experience\r\nof the _Helvetia_, and we had the terrible grief of losing her soon\r\nafter we passed Aden. She was buried at sea.\r\n\r\nIt was a very sad journey after that. There were several nice, kind\r\npeople amongst our fellow-passengers; but life on board ship at such\r\na time, surrounded by absolute strangers, was a terrible trial to us\r\nboth, and, what with the effects of the voyage and the anxiety and\r\nsorrow she had gone through, my wife was thoroughly ill when we\r\narrived at Simla towards the end of February.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The numbers actually despatched from India were 13,548,\r\nof whom 3,786 were Europeans.

He was succeeded as Viceroy\r\nby Lord Mayo, one of whose first official acts was to hold a durbar at\r\nUmballa for the reception of the Amir Sher Ali, who, after five years\r\nof civil war, had succeeded in establishing himself on the throne\r\nof Afghanistan, to which he had been nominated by his father, Dost\r\nMahomed Khan.[2]\r\n\r\nSher Ali had passed through a stormy time between the death of the\r\nDost, in June, 1863, and September, 1868. He had been acknowledged as\r\nthe rightful heir by the Government of India, and for the first three\r\nyears he held the Amirship in a precarious sort of way. His two elder\r\nbrothers, Afzal and Azim, and his nephew, Abdur Rahman (the present\r\nRuler of Afghanistan), were in rebellion against him. The death of\r\nhis favourite son and heir-apparent, Ali Khan, in action near\r\nKhelat-i-Ghilzai, in 1865, grieved him so sorely that for a time his\r\nreason was affected. In May, 1866, he was defeated near Ghazni (mainly\r\nowing to the treachery of his own troops) by Abdur Rahman, who,\r\nreleasing his father, Afzal, from the prison into which he had been\r\ncast by Sher Ali, led him in triumph to Kabul, and proclaimed him Amir\r\nof Afghanistan.\r\n\r\nThe new Amir, Afzal, at once wrote to the Government of India\r\ndetailing what had occurred, and expressing a hope that the friendship\r\nof the British, which he so greatly valued, would be extended to him.\r\nHe was told, in reply, that the Government recognized him as Ruler of\r\nKabul, but that, as Sher Ali still held Kandahar and Herat, existing\r\nengagements with the latter could not be broken off. The evident\r\npreference thus displayed for Sher Ali caused the greatest vexation to\r\nthe brothers Afzal and Azim, who showed their resentment by directing\r\nan Envoy who had come from Swat to pay his respects to the new Amir\r\nto return to his own country and set on foot a holy war against the\r\nEnglish; the Waziri _maliks_[3] in attendance at the court were\r\ndismissed with presents and directions to harass the British frontier,\r\nwhile an emissary was despatched on a secret mission to the Russians.\r\n\r\nAfter his defeat near Ghazni, Sher Ali fled to Kandahar, and in the\r\nJanuary of the following year (again owing to treachery in his army)\r\nhe met with a second defeat near Khelat-i-Ghilzai, and lost Kandahar.\r\n\r\nOn this fact being communicated to the Government of India, Afzal Khan\r\nwas in his turn recognized as Amir of Kabul and Kandahar. But he was\r\nat the same time informed that the British Government intended to\r\nmaintain a strict neutrality between the contending parties in\r\nAfghanistan. John Lawrence, in his letter of the 20th of February,\r\nsaid that 'neither men, nor arms, nor money, nor assistance of any\r\nkind, have ever been supplied by my Government to Amir Sher Ali. Your\r\nHighness and he, both equally unaided by me, have fought out the\r\nbattle, each upon your own resources. I purpose to continue the same\r\npolicy for the future. If, unhappily, the struggle for supremacy in\r\nAfghanistan has not yet been brought to a close, and hostilities are\r\nagain renewed, I shall still side with neither party.'\r\n\r\nThis reply altogether failed to satisfy Afzal and Azim. They answered\r\nit civilly, but at the same time they sent a copy of it to General\r\nRomanofski, the Russian Governor of Tashkent, who was informed by\r\nthe new Amir that he had no confidence in the 'Lord _sahib's_ fine\r\nprofessions of friendship, and that he was disgusted with the British\r\nGovernment for the ingratitude and ill-treatment shown towards his\r\nbrother Azim.[4] He looked upon the Russians as his real and only\r\nfriends, hoped soon to send a regular Ambassador to the Russian camp,\r\nand would at all times do his utmost to protect and encourage Russian\r\ntrade.'\r\n\r\nIn October of this year (1867) Afzal Khan died, and his brother Azim,\r\nhastening to Kabul, took upon himself the Amirship. Abdur Rahman had\r\nhoped to have succeeded his father, but his uncle having forestalled\r\nhim, he thought it politic to give in his allegiance to him, which he\r\ndid by presenting his dead father's sword, in durbar, to the new Amir,\r\nwho, like his predecessor, was now acknowledged by the Government of\r\nIndia as Ruler of Kabul and Kandahar.\r\n\r\nThe tide, however, was beginning to turn in favour of Sher Ali. Azim\r\nand Abdur Rahman quarrelled, and the former, by his extortions and\r\ncruelties, made himself detested by the people generally.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1868, Sher Ali's eldest son, Yakub Khan, regained possession\r\nof Kandahar for his father. In July father and son found themselves\r\nstrong enough to move towards Ghazni, where Azim Khan's army was\r\nassembled. The latter, gradually deserted by his soldiers, took to\r\nflight, upon which Sher Ali, after an absence of forty months, entered\r\nKabul on the 8th of September, and re-possessed himself of all his\r\ndominions, with the exception of Balkh, where Azim and Abdur Rahman\r\n(now reconciled to each other) still flew the flag of rebellion.\r\n\r\nOne of the newly-installed Amir's first acts was to inform the Viceroy\r\nof his return to Kabul, and of the recovery of his kingdom. He\r\nannounced his desire to send some trusted representatives, or else\r\nproceed himself in person, to Calcutta, 'for the purpose of showing\r\nhis sincerity and firm attachment to the British Government, and\r\nmaking known his real wants.'\r\n\r\nSir John Lawrence, in his congratulatory reply, showed that a change\r\nhad come over his policy of non-interference in the internal affairs\r\nof Afghanistan, for he stated that he was 'prepared, not only to\r\nmaintain the bonds of amity and goodwill which were established\r\nbetween Dost Mahomed and the British Government, but, so far as may be\r\npracticable, to strengthen those bonds'; and, as a substantial proof\r\nof his goodwill, the Viceroy sent Sher Ali £60,000, aid which arrived\r\nat a most opportune moment, and gave the Amir that advantage over his\r\nopponents which is of incalculable value in Afghan civil war, namely,\r\nfunds wherewith to pay the army and bribe the opposite side.\r\n\r\nThe energetic and capable Abdur Rahman Khan had in the meantime\r\ncollected a sufficient number of troops in Turkestan to enable him to\r\nmove towards Kabul with his uncle Azim. On nearing Ghazni, he found\r\nhimself confronted by Sher Ali; the opposing forces were about equal\r\nin strength, and on both sides there was the same scarcity of ready\r\nmoney. Suddenly the report was received that money was being sent from\r\nIndia to Sher Ali, and this turned the scale in his favour. Abdur\r\nRahman's men deserted in considerable numbers, and a battle fought\r\non the 3rd January, 1869, resulted in the total defeat of uncle and\r\nnephew, and in the firmer consolidation of Sher Ali's supremacy.\r\n\r\nThe change in policy which induced the Government of India to assist\r\na struggling Amir with money, after its repeated and emphatic\r\ndeclarations that interference was impossible, was undoubtedly brought\r\nabout by an able and elaborate memorandum written by the late Sir\r\nHenry Rawlinson on the 28th July, 1868. In this paper Rawlinson\r\npointed out that, notwithstanding promises to the contrary, Russia was\r\nsteadily advancing towards Afghanistan. He referred to the increased\r\nfacilities of communication which would be the result of the recent\r\nproposal to bring Turkestan into direct communication, _viâ_ the\r\nCaspian, with the Caucasus and St. Petersburg. He dwelt at length upon\r\nthe effect which the advanced position of Russia in Central Asia would\r\nhave upon Afghanistan and India. He explained that by the occupation\r\nof Bokhara Russia would gain a pretext for interfering in Afghan\r\npolitics, and 'that if Russia once assumes a position which, in virtue\r\neither of an imposing military force on the Oxus, or of a dominant\r\npolitical influence in Afghanistan, entitles her, in Native\r\nestimation, to challenge our Asiatic supremacy, the disquieting effect\r\nwill be prodigious.'\r\n\r\n'With this prospect before us,' Sir Henry asked, 'are we justified\r\nin maintaining what has been sarcastically, though perhaps unfairly,\r\ncalled Sir John Lawrence's policy of \"masterly inaction\"? Are we\r\njustified in allowing Russia to work her way to Kabul unopposed, and\r\nthere to establish herself as a friendly power prepared to protect the\r\nAfghans against the English?' He argued that it was contrary to\r\nour interests to permit anarchy to reign in Afghanistan; that Lord\r\nAuckland's famous doctrine of 'establishing a strong and friendly\r\nPower on our North-West Frontier' was the right policy for India,\r\n'that Dost Mahomed's successful management of his country was in a\r\ngreat measure due to our aid, and that, if we had helped the son as we\r\nhad helped the father, Sher Ali would have summarily suppressed\r\nthe opposition of his brothers and nephews.' Rawlinson then added:\r\n'Another opportunity now presents itself. The fortunes of Sher Ali are\r\nagain in the ascendant; he should be secured in our interests without\r\ndelay.'\r\n\r\nRawlinson's suggestions were not at the time supposed to commend\r\nthemselves to the Government of India. In the despatch in which they\r\nwere answered,[5] the Viceroy and his Councillors stated that\r\nthey still objected to any active interference in the affairs of\r\nAfghanistan; they foresaw no limits to the expenditure which such a\r\nmove would entail, and they believed that the objects that they had at\r\nheart might be attained by an attitude of readiness and firmness on\r\nthe frontier. It is worthy of note, however, that, after Sir Henry\r\nRawlinson's memorandum had been received by the Indian Government, and\r\nnotwithstanding these protests, the sum of £60,000 was sent to Sher\r\nAli, that Sir John Lawrence invited him 'to come to some place in\r\nBritish territory for a personal meeting in order to discuss the best\r\nmanner in which a limited support might be accorded,' and that five\r\ndays from the time of writing the above-mentioned despatch, John\r\nLawrence sent a farewell letter to Sher Ali, expressing the earnest\r\nhope of the British Government that His Highness's authority would be\r\nestablished on a solid and permanent basis, and informing him that a\r\nfurther sum of £60,000 would be supplied to him during the next few\r\nmonths, and that future Viceroys would consider, from time to time,\r\nwhat amount of practical assistance in the shape of money or war\r\nmaterials should periodically be made over to him as a testimony of\r\ntheir friendly feeling, and to the furtherance of his legitimate\r\nauthority and influence.\r\n\r\nSher Ali expressed himself as most grateful, and came to Umballa full\r\nof hope and apparently thoroughly well disposed towards the British\r\nGovernment. He was received with great state and ceremony, and Lord\r\nMayo was most careful to demonstrate that he was treating with an\r\nindependent, and not a feudatory, Prince.\r\n\r\nAt this conference Sher Ali began by unburdening himself of his\r\ngrievances, complaining to Lord Mayo of the manner in which his two\r\nelder brothers had each in his turn been recognized as Amir, and\r\ndwelling on the one-sided nature of the treaty made with his father,\r\nby which the British Government only bound itself to abstain from\r\ninterfering with Afghanistan, while the Amir was to be 'the friend of\r\nthe friends and the enemy of the enemies of the Honourable East India\r\nCompany.' His Highness then proceeded to make known his wants, which\r\nwere that he and his lineal descendants on the throne that he had\r\nwon 'by his own good sword' should be acknowledged as the _de jure_\r\nsovereigns of Afghanistan; that a treaty offensive and defensive\r\nshould be made with him; and that he should be given a fixed subsidy\r\nin the form of an annual payment.\r\n\r\nIt was in regard to the first of these three demands that Sher Ali was\r\nmost persistent. He explained repeatedly and at some length that to\r\nacknowledge the Ruler _pro tempore_ and _de facto_ was to invite\r\ncompetition for a throne, and excite the hopes of all sorts of\r\ncandidates; but that if the British Government would recognize him and\r\nhis dynasty, there was nothing he would not do in order to evince his\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\nThese requests, the Amir was informed, were inadmissible. There could\r\nbe no treaty, no fixed subsidy, no dynastic pledges. He was further\r\ntold that we were prepared to discourage his rivals, to give him warm\r\ncountenance and support, and such material assistance as we considered\r\nabsolutely necessary for his immediate wants, if he, on his part,\r\nwould undertake to do all he could to maintain peace on our frontier\r\nand to comply with our wishes in matters connected with trade.\r\n\r\nAs an earnest of our goodwill, the Amir was given the second £60,000\r\npromised him by Sir John Lawrence, besides a considerable supply of\r\narms and ammunition,[6] and was made happy by a promise that European\r\nofficers should not be required to reside in any of his cities. Before\r\nthe conference took place, Lord Mayo had contemplated British agents\r\nbeing sent to Kabul in order to obtain accurate information regarding\r\nevents in Central Asia, but on discovering how vehemently opposed Sher\r\nAli was to such an arrangement, he gave him this promise. Saiyad Nur\r\nMahomed, the Minister who accompanied the Amir, though equally averse\r\nto European agents, admitted that 'the day might come when the\r\nRussians would arrive, and the Amir would be glad, not only of British\r\nofficers as agents, but of arms and troops to back them.'\r\n\r\nOne request which the Amir made towards the close of the meeting the\r\nViceroy agreed to, which was that we should call Persia to account for\r\nher alleged encroachments on the debatable ground of Sistan. This,\r\nwhich seemed but an unimportant matter at the time, was one of the\r\nchief causes of Sher Ali's subsequent estrangement; for the committee\r\nof arbitration which inquired into it decided against the Amir,\r\nwho never forgave what he considered our unfriendly action in\r\ndiscountenancing his claims.\r\n\r\nThe Umballa conference was, on the whole, successful, in that Sher Ali\r\nreturned to his own country much gratified at the splendour of his\r\nreception, and a firm personal friend of Lord Mayo, whose fine\r\npresence and genial manner had quite won the Amir's heart, although he\r\nhad not succeeded in getting from him everything he had demanded.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: I should have mentioned that Sir John Lawrence was not\r\nthe only instance of a Bengal civilian rising to the position of\r\nGovernor-General, as a predecessor of his, Sir John Shore, afterwards\r\nLord Teignmouth, was appointed Governor-General in 1792, and held that\r\noffice until 1798.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Dost Mahomed had several sons.

My wife was far from strong, and\r\nwe had another great sorrow in the death of a baby boy three weeks\r\nafter his birth.\r\n\r\nThat winter I was left in charge of the Quartermaster-General's\r\noffice, and we moved into 'Ellerslie,' a larger and warmer house than\r\nthat in which we had lived during the summer.\r\n\r\nSimla in the winter, after a fresh fall of snow, is particularly\r\nbeautiful. Range after range of hills clothed in their spotless\r\ngarments stretch away as far as the eye can reach, relieved in the\r\nforeground by masses of reddish-brown perpendicular cliffs and\r\ndark-green ilex and deodar trees, each bearing its pure white burden,\r\nand decked with glistening fringes of icicles. Towards evening the\r\nscene changes, and the snow takes the most gorgeous colouring from\r\nthe descending rays of the brilliant eastern sun--brilliant even in\r\nmid-winter--turning opal, pink, scarlet, and crimson; gradually, as\r\nthe light wanes, fading into delicate lilacs and grays, which slowly\r\nmount upwards, till at last even the highest pinnacle loses the\r\nlife-giving tints, and the whole snowy range itself turns cold and\r\nwhite and dead against a background of deepest sapphire blue. The\r\nspectator shivers, folds himself more closely in his wraps, and\r\nretreats indoors, glad to be greeted by a blazing log-fire and a hot\r\ncup of tea.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the next year (1870) Sir William Mansfield's term\r\nof command came to an end, and he was succeeded by Lord Napier of\r\nMagd[=a]la. The selection of this distinguished officer for the\r\nhighest military position in India was greatly appreciated by the\r\nIndian army, as no officer of that army had held it since the days of\r\nLord Clive.\r\n\r\nIn September a daughter was born, and that winter we again remained\r\nat Simla. I amused myself by going through a course of electric\r\ntelegraphy, which may seem rather like a work of supererogation; but\r\nduring the Umbeyla campaign, when the telegraph office had to be\r\nclosed in consequence of all the clerks being laid up with fever, and\r\nwe could neither read nor send messages, I determined that I would on\r\nthe first opportunity learn electric signalling, in order that I might\r\nbe able to decipher and send telegrams should I ever again find myself\r\nin a similar position.\r\n\r\nIn May my wife and I went for a march across the hills to Chakrata,\r\nand thence to Mussoorie and back by way of Dehra Dun and the plains.\r\nThe object of this trip was to settle the boundary of Chakrata, and my\r\nwife took the opportunity of my being ordered on this duty to get away\r\nfrom Simla, as we had now been there for more than two years, and were\r\nconsequently rather longing for a change. Our route lay through most\r\nbeautiful scenery, and notwithstanding that the trip was a little\r\nhurried, and that some of the marches were therefore rather long, we\r\nenjoyed it immensely. When passing along the ridge of a very high\r\nhill one afternoon, we witnessed rather a curious sight--a violent\r\nthunderstorm was going on in the valley below us, while we ourselves\r\nremained in the mildest, most serene atmosphere, enjoying bright\r\nsunshine and a blue sky. Dense black clouds filled up the valley a\r\nthousand feet beneath us, the thunder roared, the lightning flashed,\r\nand soon we could hear the rush of waters in the streams below from\r\nthe torrents of rain which the clouds were discharging; but it was not\r\nuntil we had crossed over the mountain, and descended to a low level\r\non the other side, that we fully realized the effects of the heavy\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\nOn our return to Simla we had the pleasure of a visit from\r\nMajor-General Donald Stewart, who had come up to receive Lord Mayo's\r\ninstructions before taking over his appointment as Superintendent\r\nof the Andaman Islands. In September he and I travelled together to\r\nCalcutta, to which place I was directed to proceed in order to make\r\narrangements for a military expedition into the country of the\r\nLushais, having been appointed senior staff officer to the force.\r\n\r\nLushai, situated between south-eastern Bengal and Burma, was a _terra\r\nincognita_ to me, and I had only heard of it in connexion with the\r\nraids made by its inhabitants upon the tea-gardens in its vicinity,\r\nwhich had now spread too far away from Cachar for the garrison of that\r\nsmall military station to afford them protection. From time to time\r\nthe Lushais had done the planters much damage, and carried off several\r\nprisoners, and various attempts had been made in the shape of small\r\nmilitary expeditions to punish the tribesmen and rescue the captives;\r\nbut from want of proper organization, and from not choosing the right\r\ntime of the year, these attempts had hitherto been unsuccessful, and\r\nour failures had the inevitable result of making the Lushais bolder.\r\nRaids became more frequent and more destructive; until at last a\r\nlittle European girl, named Mary Winchester, was carried off, and\r\nkept by them as a prisoner; on this the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal\r\ndeclared that a punitive expedition was 'absolutely necessary for the\r\nfuture security of the British subjects residing on the Cachar and\r\nChittagong frontiers.'\r\n\r\nThe despatch of a force was therefore decided upon; it was to consist\r\nof two small columns[1]--one having its base at Cachar, the other at\r\nChittagong--commanded respectively by Brigadier-Generals Bourchier,\r\nC.B., and C. Brownlow, C.B., supreme political power being also vested\r\nin these two officers. Long experience had taught Lord Napier the\r\nwisdom of having only one head in time of war, and he impressed upon\r\nthe Government his opinion that the civil officers, while acting as\r\nadvisers and as the channels of communication with the tribes, should\r\nbe subordinate to the control of the two Commanders, who, after having\r\nbeen put in possession of the views and wishes of the Government,\r\nshould be held responsible for carrying them out loyally so far as\r\ncircumstances and the safety of the force would permit.\r\n\r\nAs the existence of the tea industry was at stake, the Lushais having\r\nestablished a perfect terror on all the estates within their reach,\r\nit was essential that they should be given a severe lesson, and this\r\ncould only be done by their principal villages, which lay at some\r\nconsiderable distance from the base of operations, being visited in\r\nforce. The difficult country and the paucity of transport necessitated\r\nthe columns being lightly equipped; no tents were to be allowed, and\r\nbaggage and followers were to be reduced to a minimum. My instructions\r\nwere to fit out and despatch the two columns, and then join\r\nBrigadier-General Bourchier at Cachar.\r\n\r\nI was kept in Calcutta all October--not a pleasant month, the climate\r\nthen being very muggy and unhealthy. Everyone who could get away had\r\ngone to the Hills or out to sea; and the offices being closed for the\r\nHindu holidays of the _Durga Puja,_ it was extremely difficult to get\r\nwork done. Everything for the Chittagong column had to be sent by\r\nsea. The shipping of the elephants was rather interesting: they clung\r\ndesperately to the ground, trying hard to prevent themselves being\r\nlifted from it; and when at last, in spite of all their struggles,\r\nthey were hoisted into the air, the helpless appearance of the huge\r\nanimals and their despairing little cries and whines were quite\r\npathetic. I found it trying work being on the river all day; my eyes\r\nsuffered from the glare, and I became so reduced that before I left\r\nCalcutta I weighed scarcely over eight stone--rather too fine a\r\ncondition in which to enter on a campaign in a mountainous country, so\r\nthickly covered with jungle as to make riding out of the question.\r\n\r\nBy the 3rd November the equipment and stores for both columns had been\r\ndespatched, and on the 16th I joined General Bourchier at the house of\r\nthat most hospitable of hosts, Mr. Edgar,[2] Deputy-Commissioner of\r\nCachar, who accompanied the left column as civil officer.\r\n\r\nWe left Cachar on the 23rd, and from the outset we had to make our own\r\nroads, a labour which never ceased until the end of January, by which\r\ndate 110 miles had been completed. There was not the vestige of a\r\ntrack to direct us; but I got hold of some people of the country, with\r\nwhom I made friends, and induced them to act as guides. Many a long\r\nand weary reconnaissance had to be executed, however, before the line\r\nof advance could be decided upon. The troops worked with a will, and,\r\nnotwithstanding the vapour-bath-like atmosphere of the valleys and the\r\ndifficult nature of the country, which was a succession of hill-ranges\r\ncovered with jungle forests, made almost impenetrable from the huge\r\ncreepers, and intersected by rivers and watercourses, a good road,\r\nfrom six to eight feet wide, was constructed, with a sufficiently easy\r\ngradient for laden elephants to travel over. Cutting one's way day\r\nafter day through these dense, gloomy forests, through which hardly a\r\nray of light penetrates, was most stifling and depressing. One could\r\nhardly breathe, and was quite unable to enjoy the beauty of the\r\nmagnificent trees, the graceful bamboos and canes, and the wonderful\r\ncreepers, which abounded, and under other circumstances would have\r\nbeen a source of pleasure; the difficulties we encountered, and the\r\nconsequent delay in our progress, quite prevented me from being in a\r\nframe of mind to appreciate my picturesque surroundings.\r\n\r\nIt became evident from the first that our onward movements would be\r\ngreatly impeded by want of transport. Notwithstanding the experience\r\nwhich ought to have been gained in many small mountain wars, the\r\nGovernment had not been taught that a properly organized transport\r\ncorps was an absolute necessity, and that it was a mere waste of money\r\nto collect a number of men and animals without providing trained\r\nsupervision. Fourteen hundred of our coolies were attached to\r\nthe Commissariat Department without anyone to look after them,\r\nconsequently officers and non-commissioned officers, who could ill be\r\nspared from their regimental duties, had to be told off to organize\r\nand work them.\r\n\r\nTo add to our troubles, cholera broke out amongst some Nepalese\r\ncoolies on their way to join us; out of 840, 251 died in a few days,\r\nand a number deserted panic-stricken, while the rest were so weakened\r\nand shaken that, notwithstanding the care bestowed upon them by their\r\nable and energetic Commandant, Major H. Moore, only 387 joined the\r\ncolumn. We were not much better off in the matter of elephants, which\r\nhad been so carelessly selected that only 33 out of the 157 sent with\r\nour column were of any use. All this resulted in our being obliged to\r\nstill further reduce our already small kits. Officers were allowed\r\nonly forty pounds of baggage, and soldiers twenty-four pounds, limits\r\nwithin which it was rather difficult to keep. A couple of blankets\r\nwere essential, as we should have to operate over mountains five and\r\nsix thousand feet high; so was a waterproof sheet, for even if we\r\nshould be lucky enough to escape rain, the dew is so heavy in those\r\nparts that it wets one just as thoroughly as a shower of rain. These\r\nthree items with my cloak and cork mattress--which is also a very\r\nnecessary adjunct in such a damp climate--amounted to thirty-one\r\npounds, leaving only nine pounds for a change of clothes, plate,\r\nknife, fork, etc.--not too much for a four months' campaign. However,\r\n'needs must,' and it is surprising how many things one considers\r\nabsolute necessities under ordinary circumstances turn out to have\r\nbeen luxuries when we are obliged to dispense with them.\r\n\r\nThe advance portion of the column did not arrive at Tipai Mukh, only\r\neighty-four miles from Cachar, until the 9th December, which will give\r\nan idea of the enforced slowness of our progress. Tipai Mukh proved a\r\nvery suitable place for our depot: it was situated at the junction\r\nof two rivers, the Tipai and the Barak; thickly-wooded hills rose\r\nprecipitously on all sides, but on the right bank of the Barak there\r\nwas sufficient level space for all our requirements. With the help\r\nof local coolies, the little Gurkhas were not long in running up\r\nhospitals and storesheds; bamboo, the one material used in Lushailand\r\nfor every conceivable purpose, whether it be a house, a drinking\r\nvessel, a bridge, a woman's ear-ring, or a musical instrument, grew\r\nin profusion on the hillside. A trestle bridge was thrown across the\r\nTipai in a few hours, and about that bridge I have rather an amusing\r\nstory to relate. On my telling the young Engineer officer in charge of\r\nthe Sapper company that a bridge was required to be constructed with\r\nthe least possible delay, he replied that it should be done, but that\r\nit was necessary to calculate the force of the current, the weight to\r\nbe borne, and the consequent strength of the timber required. Off he\r\nwent, urged by me to be as quick as he could. Some hours elapsed, and\r\nnothing was seen of the Engineer, so I sent for him and asked him when\r\nthe bridge was to be begun. He answered that his plans were nearly\r\ncompleted, and that he would soon be able to commence work. In the\r\nmeantime, however, and while these scientific calculations were being\r\nmade, the headman of the local coolies had come to me and said, if the\r\norder were given, he would throw a good bridge over the river in no\r\ntime. I agreed, knowing how clever Natives often are at this kind\r\nof work, and thinking I might just as well have two strings to this\r\nparticular bow. Immediately, numbers of men were to be seen felling\r\nthe bamboos on the hillside a short distance above the stream: these\r\nwere thrown into the river, and as they came floating down they were\r\ncaught by men standing up to their necks in water, who cut them to the\r\nrequired length, stuck the uprights into the river-bed, and attached\r\nthem to each other by pieces laid laterally and longitudinally; the\r\nflooring was then formed also of bamboo, the whole structure was\r\nfirmly bound together by strips of cane, and the bridge was pronounced\r\nready. Having tested its strength by marching a large number of men\r\nacross it, I sent for my Engineer friend. His astonishment on seeing a\r\nbridge finished ready for use was great, and became still greater when\r\nhe found how admirably the practical woodmen had done their work; from\r\nthat time, being assured of their ability to assist him, he wisely\r\navailed himself when difficulties arose of their useful, if\r\nunscientific, method of engineering.\r\n\r\nBy the 14th December matters had so far progressed as to warrant an\r\nadvance. As our route now lay away from the river, scarcity of water\r\nentailed greater care being taken in the selection of encamping\r\ngrounds, so on arriving at our halting-place each day I had to\r\nreconnoitre ahead for a suitable site for our next resting-ground, a\r\nconsiderable addition to the day's work. Road-making for the passage\r\nof the elephants became more difficult, and transport was so deficient\r\nthat the troops could only be brought up very gradually. Thus, it was\r\nthe 22nd of the month before we reached the Tuibum river, only twenty\r\nmiles from Tipai Mukh. On our way we were met by some scouts from\r\nthe villages ahead of us, who implored of us to advance no further,\r\nsaying, if we would only halt, their headmen would come in and submit\r\nto whatever terms we chose to make. The villagers were informed in\r\nreply that our quarrel was not with them, and so long as we remained\r\nunmolested, not the slightest injury should be done to them, their\r\nvillages, or their crops; but that we were determined to reach the\r\ncountry of Lalbura, the Chief who had been the ringleader in the raids\r\nupon the tea-gardens.\r\n\r\nWe pushed on as fast as the dense undergrowth would permit until\r\nwithin about a mile of the river, where we found the road blocked by\r\na curious erection in the form of a gallows, from which hung two\r\ngrotesque figures, made of bamboo. A little further on it was a felled\r\ntree which stopped us; this tree was studded all over with knife-like\r\npieces of bamboo, and from the incisions into which these were stuck\r\nexuded a red juice, exactly the colour of blood. This was the Lushai\r\nmode of warning us what would be our fate if we ventured further. We,\r\nhowever, proceeded on our way, bivouacked for the night, and early the\r\nnext morning started off in the direction of some villages which we\r\nunderstood lay in the road to our destination.\r\n\r\nFor the first thousand feet the ascent was very steep, and the path so\r\nnarrow that we could only march in single file. Suddenly we entered\r\nupon a piece of ground cleared for cultivation, and as we emerged from\r\nthe forest we were received by a volley from a position about sixty\r\nyards off. A young police orderly, who was acting as our guide, was\r\nknocked over by my side, and a second volley wounded one of the\r\nsepoys, on which we charged and the enemy retired up the hill. We came\r\nacross a large number of these _jooms_ (clearings), and at each there\r\nwas a like effort to oppose us, always with the same result. After\r\nadvancing in this way for the greater part of the day, alternately\r\nthrough dense jungle and open spaces, and occasionally passing by\r\nscattered cottages, we sighted a good-sized village, where it was\r\ndecided we should remain for the night. The day's march had been very\r\nsevere, the village being 4,000 feet above the river; and the troops\r\nwere so worn out with their exertions that it was with difficulty the\r\npiquets could be got to construct proper shelter for themselves out of\r\nthe plentiful supply of trees and underwood ready at hand. Throughout\r\nthe night the enemy's sharpshooters kept up an annoying fire under\r\ncover of the forest which surrounded the village, and so as soon as\r\nday dawned a party moved out to clear the ground all round.\r\n\r\nIt was most aggravating to find from the view we got of the country\r\nfrom this elevated position that the previous day's harassing march\r\nhad been an absolutely useless performance and an unnecessary waste of\r\ntime and strength. We could now distinctly see that this village did\r\nnot lead to Lalbura's country, as we had been led to believe it would,\r\nand that there was no alternative but to retrace our steps as far as\r\nthe river. The men and animals were too tired to march that day, and\r\nthe next being Christmas, we made another halt, and commenced our\r\nretirement on the 26th. This was an extremely nasty business, and\r\nhad to be carried out with very great caution. The ground, as I said\r\nbefore, necessitated our proceeding in single file, and with only\r\n250 fighting men (all that our deficient transport admitted of being\r\nbrought on to this point) it was difficult to guard the long line\r\nof sick, wounded, and coolies. As soon as we began to draw in our\r\npiquets, the Lushais, who had never ceased their fire, perceiving we\r\nwere about to retire, came down in force, and entered one end of the\r\nvillage, yelling and screaming like demons, before we had got out\r\nat the other. The whole way down the hill they pressed us hard,\r\nendeavouring to get amongst the baggage, but were invariably baffled\r\nby the Gurkhas, who, extending rapidly whenever the ground was\r\nfavourable, retired through their supports in admirable order, and\r\ndid not once give the enemy the chance of passing them. We had 3 men\r\nkilled and 8 wounded during the march, but the Lushais confessed\r\nafterwards to a loss of between 50 and 60.\r\n\r\nAs we were given to understand that our short retrograde movement had\r\nbeen interpreted into a defeat by the Lushais, the General wisely\r\ndetermined to pay the village of Kholel another visit. Our doing so\r\nhad the best possible effect. A slight resistance was offered at the\r\nfirst clearance, but by the time the ridge was reached the Chief,\r\nhaving become convinced of the uselessness of further opposition,\r\nsubmitted, and engaged to give hostages and keep open communication\r\nwith our depot at Tipai Mukh, a promise which he most faithfully\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\n1872 opened auspiciously for me. On New Year's Day I was agreeably\r\nsurprised by a communication from the Quartermaster-General informing\r\nme that, a vacancy having unexpectedly occurred, Lord Napier had\r\nappointed me Deputy-Quartermaster-General. This was an important step\r\nin my department, and I was proportionately elated.\r\n\r\nA few days later I received the good news of the birth of a son at\r\nUmballa on the 8th.\r\n\r\nPaucity of transport and difficulty about supplies kept us stationary\r\non the Tuibum for some time, after which we moved on as before, the\r\nLushais retiring in front of us until the 25th, when they attacked\r\nus while we were moving along a narrow ravine, with a stream at the\r\nbottom and steep hills on either side. The first volley wounded the\r\nGeneral in the arm and hand, and killed his orderly. The enemy's\r\nintention was evidently to push past the weak column along the\r\nhillside and get amongst the coolies; but this attempt was again\r\nfoiled by the Gurkhas, who, flinging off their great-coats, rushed\r\ninto the stream and engaged the Lushais before they could get at the\r\nbaggage, pressing them up the mountain, rising 2,500 feet above us, as\r\nfast as the precipitous nature of the ascent would allow. On the crest\r\nwe found the enemy occupying a good-sized village, out of which we\r\ncleared them and took possession of it ourselves. On this occasion\r\nwe had only 4 killed and 8 wounded, including the General, while the\r\nenemy lost about 60. In one place we found a heap of headless bodies.\r\nThe Lushais, if unable to remove their dead, invariably decapitate\r\nthem to prevent their adversaries from carrying off the heads, their\r\nown mode of dealing with a slain enemy, as they believe that whoever\r\nis in possession of the head will have the man to whom it belonged as\r\na slave in the next world.\r\n\r\nTo complete the success we had gained, the General sent me the next\r\nday with a small party to burn the village of Taikum, belonging to the\r\npeople who had attacked us. It was past noon before we could make a\r\nstart, owing to the non-arrival of the elephants with the guns. When\r\nthey did come in, the poor huge creatures were so fatigued by their\r\nclimb that it was considered advisable to transfer their loads to\r\ncoolies, particularly as the route we had to traverse was reported to\r\nbe even more difficult than anything we had yet encountered. When we\r\nhad proceeded a short distance, we perceived that our way was blocked\r\na mile ahead by a most formidable-looking stockade, on one side of\r\nwhich rose perpendicular cliffs, while on the other was a rocky\r\nravine. As the nature of the ground did not admit of my approaching\r\nnear enough to discover whether the Artillery could be placed so as to\r\ncover the Infantry advance, and being anxious to avoid losing many\r\nof my small party, I settled to turn the stockade by a detour up the\r\nhillside. This manoeuvre took some time, owing to the uncompromising\r\nnature of the country; but it was successful, for when we struck\r\nthe track, we found ourselves about a mile on the other side of the\r\nstockade. The Lushais, on realizing what we were about, retired to\r\nTaikum, which place came into view at 5 p.m. It was situated on the\r\nsummit of a hill 1,200 yards in front, and was crowded with men. The\r\nguns were brought at once into action, and while Captain Blackwood[3]\r\nwas preparing his fuses, I advanced towards the village with the\r\nInfantry. The first shell burst a little beyond the village, the\r\nsecond was lodged in its very centre, for a time completely paralyzing\r\nthe Lushais. On recovering from the shock, they took to their heels\r\nand scampered off in every direction, the last man leaving the village\r\njust as we entered it. The houses, as usual, were made of bamboo, and\r\nafter it had been ascertained that there was no living creature inside\r\nany of them, the place was set on fire, and we began our return\r\njourney. There was a bright moon, but even aided by its light we did\r\nnot reach our bivouac until midnight. This ended the campaign so far\r\nas opposition was concerned, for not another shot was fired either by\r\nus or against us during the remaining six weeks we continued in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nSoon after this we heard that some of the captives we had come to\r\nrelieve had been given up to the Chittagong column, and that Mary\r\nWinchester was safe in General Brownlow's hands--very satisfactory\r\nintelligence, showing as it did that the Lushais were beginning to\r\nunderstand the advisability of acceding to our demands. The work of\r\nour column, however, was not over, for although, from the information\r\nwe received of his whereabouts, we had given up hope of joining hands\r\nwith Brownlow, Bourchier determined that Lalbura's country must be\r\nreached; he (Lalbura) being the chief offender, it would never have\r\ndone to let him think his stronghold lay beyond our power.\r\n\r\nIn order that we might be well out of Lushailand before the rains,\r\nwhich usually begin in that part of the world about the middle of\r\nMarch, and are extremely heavy, it was decided not to wait until a\r\nroad could be made for elephants, but to trust to coolie-carriage\r\nalone, and to push on rapidly as soon as supplies sufficient for\r\ntwelve days could be collected. Kits were still further reduced,\r\nofficers and soldiers alike being only allowed a couple of blankets\r\nand one or two cooking utensils.\r\n\r\nWe resumed our march on the 12th February; the route in many places\r\nwas strongly and skilfully stockaded, but the tidings of our successes\r\nhad preceded us, and our advance was unopposed. In five days we\r\nreached the Chamfai valley, at the end of which, on a high hill,\r\nLalbura's village was situated.[4] Although Lalbura's father, Vonolel,\r\nhad been dead some years, the people still called the place Vonolel's\r\ncountry. Vonolel had been a famous warrior, and they were evidently\r\nvery proud of his reputation. We were shown his tomb, which, like that\r\nof all great Lushai braves, was decorated with the heads of human\r\nbeings (his slaves in paradise) and those of animals, besides\r\ndrinking-vessels and various kinds of utensils for his use in another\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nLalbura had taken himself off; but his headmen submitted to us and\r\naccepted our terms. We remained at this place till the 21st, in\r\naccordance with an agreement we had made with Brownlow to send up\r\nsignals on the night of the 20th in case his column should be anywhere\r\nin the neighbourhood. During the three days we stayed amongst them\r\nwe mixed freely with the Lushais, who were greatly delighted and\r\nastonished with all we had to show them. The telescope and the\r\nburning-glass amused them greatly; our revolvers excited their\r\nenvy; and for the little Mountain guns they displayed the highest\r\nveneration. But what seemed to astonish them more than anything was\r\nthe whiteness of our skins, particularly when on closer inspection\r\nthey discovered that our arms and bodies were even fairer than our\r\nfaces and hands, which to our eyes had become from long exposure so\r\nbronzed as to make us almost unrecognizable as Europeans.\r\n\r\nWe were all glad that the duty entrusted to us had been satisfactorily\r\nended, and we were hoping that the Viceroy, who had taken a keen\r\npersonal interest in our proceedings, would be satisfied with the\r\nresult, when we were shocked and startled beyond measure by hearing\r\nthat Lord Mayo had been murdered by a convict while visiting the\r\nAndaman Islands. The disastrous news arrived as we were in the midst\r\nof firing signal-rockets, burning blue-lights, and lighting bonfires\r\nto attract the attention of the Chittagong column. I could not help\r\nthinking of the heavy loss India had sustained, for the manly,\r\nopen-hearted Governor-General had impressed the Native Chiefs in quite\r\nan exceptional manner, and he was liked as well as respected by all\r\nclasses of Europeans and Natives. I felt also much for Donald Stewart,\r\nto whom, I knew, such a terrible tragedy, happening while he was\r\nSuperintendent at Port Blair, would be a heavy blow.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th March we reached Tipai Mukh, where we bade farewell to our\r\nLushai friends, numbers of whom accompanied us to get possession of\r\nthe empty tins, bags, and casks which were got rid of at every stage.\r\nThe hostages and those who had assisted us were liberally rewarded,\r\nand we parted on the best of terms, with promises on their part of\r\nfuture good behaviour--promises which were kept for nearly twenty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nNo one was sorry that the marching was at an end, and that the rest of\r\nthe journey back was to be performed in boats. Constant hard work and\r\nexposure in a peculiarly malarious and relaxing climate had told upon\r\nthe whole force; while our having to depend for so long on tinned\r\nmeats, which were not always good, and consisted chiefly of pork, with\r\nan occasional ration of mutton and salt beef, had been very trying to\r\nthe officers. One and all were 'completely worn out,' as the principal\r\nmedical officer reported; two out of our small number died, and the\r\nGeneral's condition gave cause for grave anxiety. For myself, having a\r\nperfect horror of pork, I think I should have starved outright but\r\nfor the extraordinary culinary talent of Mr. Edgar, who disguised\r\nthe presence of the unclean animal in such a wonderful way in soups,\r\nstews, etc., that I frequently partook of it without knowing what I\r\nwas eating. My wife and some anonymous kind friend sent by post small\r\ntins of Liebig's extract, which were highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nCholera pursued us up to and beyond Cachar; the wretched coolies\r\nsuffered most, and it is a disease to which Gurkhas are peculiarly\r\nsusceptible, while a feast on a village pig from time to time probably\r\nhelped to make matters worse for them. Many of these grand little\r\nsoldiers and some of the Sikhs also fell victims to the scourge. My\r\norderly, a very smart young Gurkha, to my great regret, was seized\r\nwith it the day after I reached Cachar, and died next morning.\r\n\r\nOn my way to Simla, I spent a few days with Norman at Calcutta. The\r\nwhole place was in mourning on account of the terrible catastrophe\r\nwhich had happened at Port Blair.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Cachar column consisted of half of the Peshawar\r\nMountain battery, one company of Bengal Sappers and Miners, the 22nd\r\nPunjab Infantry, 42nd and 44th Assam Light Infantry. The Chittagong\r\ncolumn consisted of the other half of the Mountain battery, the 27th\r\nPunjab Infantry, and the 2nd and 4th Gurkhas. Each regiment was 500\r\nstrong, and each column was accompanied by 100 armed police.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Now Sir John Edgar, K.C.S.I.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Major Blackwood, who was killed at Maiwand, in command of\r\nE Battery, R.H.A.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Latitude 23° 26' 32\", longitude (approximately) 93° 25';\r\nwithin a short distance of Fort White, lately built in the Chin Hills.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n1872-1873\r\n\r\n  Lord Napier's care for the soldier\r\n  --Negotiations with Sher Ali renewed--Sher Ali's demands\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Napier of Murchiston, the Governor of Madras, had been summoned\r\nto Calcutta to act as Viceroy until Lord Northbrook, Lord Mayo's\r\nsuccessor, should arrive. He seemed interested in what I had to tell\r\nhim about Lushai, and Lord Napier of Magd[=a]la spoke in laudatory\r\nterms of the manner in which the expedition had been carried out.\r\n\r\nI reached Simla on the 1st of April, the twentieth anniversary of my\r\narrival in India. I found my wife, with the two children, settled in\r\nSnowdon,[1] a house I had recently purchased. She had had much trouble\r\nin my absence, having been at death's door herself, and having very\r\nnearly lost our little son at Umballa three weeks after his birth\r\nfrom a Native wet-nurse having tried to kill him. The English nurse's\r\nsuspicions had been aroused by one day finding a live coal in the\r\ncradle, but she did not mention this discovery at the time for fear of\r\nfrightening my wife; but she determined to watch. A few days later,\r\nwhile with our little girl in the next room, she heard the baby boy\r\nchoking, and rushed in to find, to her horror, blood on his lips, and\r\nthat he was struggling violently, as if to get rid of something in his\r\nthroat! She pushed down her finger and pulled out a sharp piece of\r\ncane about two inches long; but other pieces had evidently gone down,\r\nfor the poor little fellow was in terrible agony for many days. It\r\nturned out that the wretched woman hated the unwonted confinement of\r\nher new life, and was determined to get away, but was too much afraid\r\nof her husband to say so. He wanted her to remain for the sake of the\r\nhigh pay this class of servant receives, so it appeared to the woman\r\nthat her only chance of freedom was to get rid of the child, and to\r\ncarry out her purpose she first attempted to set fire to the cradle,\r\nand finding this did not succeed, she pulled some pieces of cane off\r\nthe chair upon which she was sitting, and shoved them down the child's\r\nthroat. She was, as my wife described her, a pretty, innocent,\r\ntimid-looking creature, to whom no one would ever have dreamt of\r\nattributing such an atrocity. The boy was made extremely delicate for\r\nseveral months by this misadventure, as his digestion had been ruined\r\nfor the time being, but eventually he completely recovered from its\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nIn September the C.B. was conferred upon me for the Lushai Expedition.\r\nLord Napier informed me of the fact in a particularly kind little\r\nnote. I was very proud of being a member of the Bath, although at the\r\ntime a brevet would have been a more useful reward, as want of rank\r\nwas the reason Lord Napier had given for not allowing me to act as\r\nQuartermaster-General, on Lumsden being temporarily appointed Resident\r\nat Hyderabad.\r\n\r\nWe began our usual winter tour in the middle of October. At Mian Mir I\r\nmade the acquaintance of the Adjutant of the 37th Foot, the late Sir\r\nHerbert Stewart, who was then a smart, good-looking subaltern, and I\r\nrecollect his bemoaning bitterly his bad luck in never having had a\r\nchance of seeing service. How little at that time could it have been\r\nanticipated that within twelve years he would see hard fighting in\r\nAfrica, and be killed as a Major-General in command of a column!\r\n\r\nWe visited several of the stations in the Punjab, and spent a few days\r\nat Jamu as guest of the Maharaja of Kashmir, who treated us royally,\r\nand gave us some excellent pig-sticking; and on the 21st December we\r\njoined Head-Quarters at Lawrencepur for a large Camp of Exercise, to\r\nbe held on the identical ground which I had selected for the camp\r\nwhich Sir Hugh Rose proposed to have eleven years before.\r\n\r\nLord Napier of Magd[=a]la did much to improve the efficiency of the\r\narmy by means of Camps of Exercise. He held one at Delhi in the winter\r\nof 1871-72, and the Camp of which I am writing was most successful and\r\ninstructive. No Commander-in-Chief ever carried out inspections with\r\nmore thoroughness than did Lord Napier of Magd[=a]la. He spared\r\nhimself no trouble. On the hottest day he would toil through barrack\r\nafter barrack to satisfy himself that the soldiers were properly cared\r\nfor; Europeans and Natives were equally attended to, and many measures\r\nconducive to the men's comfort date from the time he was in command in\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nAt the close of this camp Lumsden, who had returned to his appointment\r\nfrom Hyderabad, gave up the Quartermaster-Generalship for good. We had\r\nbeen greatly thrown together during the twenty-one years I had been in\r\nIndia, and my wife and I were very sorry to bid farewell to him and\r\nMrs. Lumsden. He was succeeded by Edwin Johnson, pending whose arrival\r\nI was now allowed to officiate.\r\n\r\nFrom Lawrencepur I went with the Commander-in-Chief to Calcutta. Soon\r\nafter we arrived there I was asked by Sir Douglas Forsyth to accompany\r\nhim on his Mission to Yarkand and Kashgar. I should have much liked to\r\nhave done so, for the idea of a trip to these, at that time unknown,\r\nregions possessed great fascinations for me. I was therefore well\r\npleased when Lord Napier told me he would not stand in the way of\r\nmy going, and proportionately disappointed when, the next day, His\r\nExcellency said that on consideration he did not think I could be\r\nspared just then, for the Quartermaster-General would be new to the\r\nwork at first, and he thought he would need my assistance.\r\n\r\nThe end of April saw us back in Simla, and in July Edwin Johnson\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1873 important events occurred which had much to\r\ndo with our subsequent relations with Afghanistan. The inquiries which\r\nSher Ali had begged Lord Mayo to make about Persian encroachments in\r\nSistan, had resulted in General Goldsmid[2] and Colonel Pollock[3]\r\nbeing deputed in 1871 to proceed to Sistan to decide the question. The\r\nsettlement arrived at by these officers, which assigned to Afghanistan\r\nthe country up to the right bank of the Helmand, but nothing beyond,\r\nsatisfied neither the Shah nor the Amir, and the latter sent his\r\nconfidential Minister, Saiyad Nur Mahomed, the Afghan Commissioner\r\nin the Sistan arbitration, to meet Lord Northbrook on his arrival in\r\nBombay for the purpose of appealing to him against the decision. It\r\ncould not, however, be reversed; but in a subsequent interview which\r\nthe new Viceroy accorded the Envoy, the latter was told that as soon\r\nas Persia and Afghanistan had signified their acceptance of the\r\nsettlement, the Government of India would present the Amir with five\r\nlakhs of rupees as compensation for the ceded territory which had for\r\na time belonged to Afghanistan.\r\n\r\nThe action of Her Majesty's Ministers in communication with Russia\r\nregarding the northern boundary of Afghanistan was another matter\r\nabout which the Amir was greatly exercised; and Lord Northbrook,\r\nthinking that all such vexed questions could be more satisfactorily\r\nexplained by personal communication than by letter, proposed to the\r\nAmir that His Highness should consent to receive at Kabul a British\r\nofficer 'of high rank and dignity, in whom I have full confidence'\r\n(Mr. Macnabb),[4] 'who will also explain to Your Highness,' wrote\r\nthe Viceroy, 'the negotiations which have now been satisfactorily\r\nconcluded with the Government of His Majesty the Emperor of Russia,\r\nwhereby the Russian Government have agreed to recognize and respect\r\nthe integrity and independence of the territories now in Your\r\nHighness's possession.'\r\n\r\nTo this request Sher Ali replied that he considered it advisable that\r\none of his agents should first wait on the Viceroy to ascertain the\r\nreal views of the British Government on these important matters. This\r\nwas agreed to, and Saiyad Nur Mahomed was again selected to represent\r\nthe Amir. He reached Simla towards the end of June. On being informed\r\nthat Persia had unreservedly accepted the decision as to the Sistan\r\nquestion, the Envoy declared that, whatever opinion the Amir might\r\nhold as to his rights, His Highness would also scrupulously respect\r\nthat decision. With regard to the northern frontier, the Envoy begged\r\nit to be clearly understood that the Afghan Government wished to be\r\nallowed to make their own laws and follow their own customs within\r\ntheir territories; that the internal affairs of the country should be\r\nfree from interference; and that the acknowledgment by Russia of the\r\nAmir's claim to land south of the Oxus should be confirmed by Bokhara.\r\nHe further requested 'that the British Government would distinctly\r\npromise that, in the event of any aggression on the Amir's\r\nterritories, they would consider the perpetrator of such aggression\r\nas their own enemy.' It was explained to the Saiyad that the British\r\nGovernment did not share the Amir's apprehension of Russia; that under\r\nsuch circumstances as he contemplated, it would be the duty of the\r\nAmir to refer to the British Government, who would decide whether it\r\nwas an occasion for assistance to be rendered by them, and what the\r\nnature and extent of the assistance should be; moreover, that their\r\nhelp must be conditional upon the Amir himself abstaining from\r\naggression, and on his unreserved acceptance of the advice of the\r\nBritish Government in regard to his external relations.\r\n\r\nTwo other questions were discussed:\r\n\r\n    (1) The location in certain towns in Afghanistan of British\r\n    officers as representatives of the British Government.\r\n\r\n    (2) The present assistance to be rendered to the Amir for the\r\n    purpose of strengthening his country against foreign aggression.\r\n\r\nOn the first point the Envoy said he had no instructions, but that, in\r\nhis opinion, to ask Sher Ali to allow British officers to be located\r\nin Afghanistan would give rise to mistrust and apprehension. He\r\nrecommended that a letter should be addressed to the Amir, pointing\r\nout the desirability of a British officer being sent to inspect the\r\nwestern and northern boundaries of Afghanistan, proceeding _viâ_\r\nKandahar and returning _viâ_ Kabul, where he might confer personally\r\nwith His Highness. This suggestion was carried out.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the second point under discussion, the Envoy stated\r\nthat 20,000 stand-of-arms were desired, laying very particular stress\r\non 5,000 Sniders being included in this number, and that hopes were\r\nentertained by the Amir that he would be largely assisted with money.\r\nIn answer to this, the Saiyad was told that there was not then a\r\nsufficient reserve supply of Sniders for the English troops in India,\r\nand that it was impossible to spare more than 5,000 Enfields; that\r\nthis number should at once be placed at the Amir's disposal, and that\r\nthe remainder should be forwarded as soon as they were received from\r\nEngland. He was further informed that five lakhs of rupees (exclusive\r\nof the five lakhs promised the year before, as indemnification for the\r\nloss of territory) would be given to Sher Ali.\r\n\r\nA final letter from the Viceroy was sent to the Amir through Saiyad\r\nNur Mahomed, dated 6th September, 1873, summing up the result of the\r\nconference. His Highness was told, with reference to a fear expressed\r\nby the Envoy lest Russia should press for the establishment of a\r\nRussian Mission and agents in Afghanistan, that Prince Gortschakoff\r\nhad officially intimated that, while he saw no objection to British\r\nofficers going to Kabul, he engaged that Russian agents should abstain\r\nfrom doing so, and that, far from apprehending a Russian invasion of\r\nAfghanistan, the British Government believed that the effect of the\r\nrecent arrangements had been to render the occurrence of such a\r\ncontingency more remote than ever. At the same time, being desirous of\r\nseeing the Amir strong and his rule firmly established, the Government\r\nwere prepared to give him any reasonable assistance.\r\n\r\nSher Ali was greatly annoyed and disappointed at the result of his\r\nEnvoy's visit to Simla. He was of a very impulsive, passionate\r\ndisposition; his reply to the Viceroy's letter was discourteous and\r\nsarcastic; he declined to receive a British officer at Kabul, and\r\nalthough he condescended to accept the arms presented to him, he left\r\nthe ten lakhs of rupees untouched in the Peshawar treasury. Colonel\r\nValentine Baker, who was at that time travelling through Central Asia,\r\nwas forbidden by the Amir to pass through Afghanistan on his way\r\nto India; and a few months later he refused to allow Sir Douglas\r\nForsyth's Mission to return to India by way of Afghanistan.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: We lived in this house whenever we were in Simla, till\r\nwe left it in 1892.

We were accompanied by a very\r\ndear friend of ours--now no more--Colonel Baigrie, who was soon\r\nafterwards made Quartermaster-General in Bombay. He was a talented\r\nartist and delightful companion, and notwithstanding the old adage\r\nthat two are company and three none, we three enjoyed our holiday\r\nimmensely.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing a stream called the Ghiri, below Fagu, the road passes\r\nthrough beautiful forest and cliff scenery, and for the most part was\r\nfairly easy, until the foot of the mountain was reached about six\r\nmiles from the top, when it became very precipitous and difficult. We\r\nwere the whole day doing this march, breakfasting in one place and\r\nlunching in another higher up. There was a good deal of snow in the\r\nshady spots. A few days before we had noticed that the top of the\r\nmountain was white, but the sun was still too strong in the daytime\r\nfor the snow to lie long in exposed parts. The way being too steep\r\nfor my wife to ride or go in a dandy, we all three walked, or rather\r\nclimbed, up to the shoulder where our tents were pitched, about a mile\r\nfrom the summit.\r\n\r\nThe forest through which we passed was very beautiful, commencing with\r\ndark-green ilex, glistening holly, and sombre brown oak, interspersed\r\nwith groups of the dainty, graceful, white-stemmed birch, and wreathed\r\nwith festoons of the scarlet Himalayan vine. As we mounted higher,\r\ntrees became fewer and the foliage less luxuriant, till at length only\r\noaks were to be seen, their branches twisted into all sorts of weird,\r\nfantastic shapes from the strength of the south-west monsoon. Huge\r\nrocks became more frequent, covered with lichens and mosses of every\r\nshade, from dark-green to brilliant crimson. At length trees and\r\nshrubs were left behind, except the red-berried juniper, which grows\r\nat a higher elevation here than any other bush, and flourishes in the\r\nclefts of the rocks, where nothing else will exist. We got up in time\r\nto see the most glorious sunset; the colours were more wonderful than\r\nanything I had ever seen before, even in India. My wife urged Baigrie\r\nto make a rough sketch, and note the tints, that he might paint a\r\npicture of it later. He made the sketch, saying: 'If I attempted to\r\nrepresent truly what we see before us, the painting would be rejected\r\nby the good people at home as absurdly unreal, or as the work of a\r\nhopeless lunatic.' There was such a high wind that our small tents had\r\na narrow escape of being blown away. That night the water was frozen\r\nin our jugs, and it was quite impossible to keep warm.\r\n\r\nWe were up betimes the next morning, and climbed to the highest peak,\r\nwhere we found breakfast awaiting us and a magnificent view of the\r\nHimalayan ranges, right down to the plains on one side and up to the\r\nperpetual snows on the other. We descended to the foot of the mountain\r\nin the afternoon, and then returned, march by march, to Simla.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the month Lord Napier began his winter tour,\r\nvisiting the hill stations first. At Chakrata I made the acquaintance\r\nof the 92nd Highlanders, that distinguished corps which stood me\r\nin such good stead a few years later in Afghanistan. At the end of\r\nNovember we found ourselves at Lucknow, in time to take part in Lord\r\nNorthbrook's state entry, and be present at a fête given to the\r\nViceroy in the Wingfield Park by Sir George Cooper, the Chief\r\nCommissioner.\r\n\r\nFrom Lucknow we went for a brief visit to a small Camp of Exercise\r\nnear Rurki, where Lord Napier left the Adjutant-General, Thesiger,[1]\r\nin command, while he himself proceeded to visit some of the stations\r\nin the Madras Presidency, and I returned for a short time to Simla.\r\n\r\nWhile riding up the hill from Kalka, I had a novel experience. One\r\nof those tremendous thunder-storms which are not uncommon in the\r\nHimalayas came on; the rain was blinding and incessant, and the peals\r\nof thunder were simultaneous with the lightning. At last there was a\r\ntremendous crash; a flash, more vivid than the rest, passed right\r\nin front of my horse's head, accompanied by a whizzing noise and a\r\nsulphurous smell, completely blinding me for a second. Two Natives\r\ntravelling a few yards ahead of me fell flat on their faces, and I\r\nthought they were killed, but it turned out they were only knocked\r\nover and very much frightened.\r\n\r\nEarly in January, 1874, we received by telegram the infinitely sad\r\nnews of my father's death. We ought, I suppose, to have been prepared\r\nfor such an event, seeing that he was within a few months of his\r\nninetieth birthday; but he was so well and active, and took such a\r\nkeen interest in all that was going on, especially anything connected\r\nwith India, that we hardly realized his great age, and always hoped we\r\nmight see him once more. He had received the G.C.B. from Her Majesty's\r\nhands at Windsor on the 8th December, and two days afterwards he wrote\r\nme an account of the ceremony, and expressed himself much pleased and\r\ngratified at the Queen's gracious manner to him. He said nothing about\r\nhis health, but we heard later that he had taken cold in the train on\r\nhis way home, and never recovered from the effects; he died on the\r\n30th of December. His love for India had not been weakened by his\r\ntwenty years' absence from the country, and he never wearied of\r\nbeing told of the wonderful changes which had taken place since his\r\nday--changes which, for the most part, dated from the Mutiny, for up\r\ntill 1857 life in India was much the same as when my father first\r\nlanded in the beginning of the century.\r\n\r\nA continued drought in Behar was at this time causing grave fears of\r\na famine, such as from time to time had desolated various parts of\r\nIndia. Nine years before such a drought, and the absence of means\r\nof communication, which prevented grain being thrown into the\r\nfamine-stricken districts in sufficient quantities, resulted\r\nin one-fourth of the population of Orissa being carried off by\r\nstarvation, or disease consequent on starvation. So on this occasion\r\nLord Northbrook was determined, at all costs, to ward off such a\r\ncalamity. He sent Sir Richard Temple to Behar in the confident hope\r\nthat his unbounded resource and energy would enable him to cope with\r\nthe difficulties of the situation, a hope that was fully realized.\r\nRelief works were at once commenced; a transport train was quickly\r\nimprovised, worked chiefly by military and police officers; and one\r\nmillion tons of rice were distributed amongst the people. Not a life\r\nwas lost, but the cost to the State was enormous--six millions and a\r\nhalf sterling.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of February I was ordered by Government to proceed to\r\nthe famine districts to help Temple. I started at once; but I had\r\nnot been long in Behar before I was required to join the\r\nCommander-in-Chief in Calcutta, His Excellency having determined to\r\nnominate me Quartermaster-General, in succession to Johnson, who was\r\nabout to become Adjutant-General. Being only a Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nin the army, I could not, according to the rules, be put at once\r\npermanently into the appointment, which carried with it the rank of\r\nMajor-General. The difficulty was overcome, however, by my being\r\nallowed to officiate till the following January, when, in the ordinary\r\ncourse of promotion, I should become a Colonel.\r\n\r\nLord Northbrook spent the summer of 1874 in Calcutta, in\r\nconsequence of the famine necessities having to be met; and as the\r\nCommander-in-Chief determined to follow his example, I took a house in\r\nCalcutta, and my wife joined me in the middle of March--rather a bad\r\ntime of year to come down to the plains after spending the winter\r\namongst the snows of Simla. But she did not fancy Simla in the season\r\nas a grass-widow, and had had quite enough of being alone.\r\n\r\nWe continued in Calcutta until August, when the Head-Quarters returned\r\nto Simla, where we remained till November.\r\n\r\nWe had a standing camp at Umballa during the winter of 1874-75, doing\r\nour inspections from there, and returning to the camp at intervals.\r\nThere was the usual visit to Calcutta in March, towards the end of\r\nwhich month another daughter was born.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1875, I spent some time at Delhi, arranging for the Camp\r\nof Exercise to be held there in January for His Royal Highness the\r\nPrince of Wales. The camp was formed in the beginning of December,\r\nand consisted of 17,000 men, in four divisions, commanded by\r\nMajor-Generals Sir Charles Reid, Macdonnell, the Hon. Arthur Hardinge,\r\nand Donald Stewart.\r\n\r\nThe country round Delhi is particularly well suited for extended\r\nmanoeuvres, and full advantage was taken of the facilities it afforded\r\nduring the two months the Camp of Exercise lasted. The Prince of Wales\r\nlanded at Calcutta on the 23rd December; and Lord Napier with his\r\nstaff went down to meet His Royal Highness, whose reception was loyal\r\nand hearty to a degree. As the _Serapis_, with the Prince on board,\r\nsteamed slowly up the Hughli, salutes were fired from Fort William and\r\nthree ships of the Royal Navy. All the vessels in the river were gay\r\nwith flags, their yards were manned, and good hearty English cheers\r\nresounded from stem to stern of each ship as the Indian troopship,\r\ncarrying the heir to England's throne, came in sight. As soon as the\r\n_Serapis_ was moored, the Viceroy went on board to greet the Prince\r\nand conduct His Royal Highness to the gaily-decorated landing-stage,\r\nwhere the principal officials, Native Princes, and chief inhabitants\r\nof Calcutta were assembled. Troops lined the road from the river to\r\nGovernment House, and the _maidan_ (the great open space in front) was\r\nthronged with a dense crowd of Natives in their most brilliant gala\r\nattire, eager to catch a glimpse of the son of the great Queen of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThat evening Lord Northbrook gave a State banquet. The next day there\r\nwas a reception of the Princes and Chiefs, followed by a levée, and\r\nafter dark the whole place was most beautifully illuminated. The\r\nweek that followed was taken up with entertainments of various\r\nkinds--balls, races, and garden-parties, interspersed with official\r\nvisits--which I am afraid the Prince could not have found amusing--and\r\non New Year's Day, 1876, His Royal Highness held a Chapter of the\r\nOrder of the Star of India, after which the Commander-in-Chief\r\nreturned to Delhi to arrange to receive the Prince in that historical\r\ncity on the 11th January.\r\n\r\nHis Royal Highness's camp, and that of the Commander-in-Chief, were\r\npitched on the ground occupied by the British army during the siege.\r\nThe road, five miles in length, from the station to the camp was lined\r\nwith troops, and on the Ridge itself were placed six Rifle corps,\r\nthree of which had taken part in the siege.[2] The 2nd Gurkhas were\r\nvery appropriately drawn up immediately under Hindu Rao's house,\r\nand when this point was reached, the Prince stopped and warmly\r\ncomplimented the men on the distinguished service the regiment had\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nThe next day there was a parade of all the troops in review order for\r\nthe inspection of the Prince, who was pleased to express his complete\r\nsatisfaction and approval of 'the steadiness under arms, soldier-like\r\nbearing, and precision of movement, which distinguish the corps of the\r\nthree armies assembled at the camp at Delhi.'\r\n\r\nThat evening the Prince was present at a ball in the _diwan-i-khas_\r\n(private audience hall) in the palace, given in His Royal Highness's\r\nhonour by the officers of the army.\r\n\r\nThe next few days were taken up with manoeuvres, which the Prince\r\nattended, accompanied by Lumsden[3] and myself. The defence was\r\ncommanded by Reid, the attack by Hardinge, the latter's object being\r\nto gain possession of the Ridge, with a view to future operations\r\nagainst the city on the arrival of the main army from the Punjab. But\r\nthe attack did not meet with the success which attended Barnard in\r\n1857, while the Commander of the defence proved himself as skilful in\r\nprotecting the Ridge against an enemy advancing from the north as\r\nhe had been, twenty years before, in repulsing one coming from the\r\nopposite direction.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Wales held another investiture of the Star of India\r\non the 7th of March at Allahabad, which Lord Napier and the staff\r\nattended. At its close we took our leave of His Royal Highness, who\r\nstarted that night for England.\r\n\r\nIn less than a fortnight our dear old Chief followed, and I saw him\r\noff from Bombay on the 10th April. I was very low at parting with him,\r\nfor though in the earlier days of our acquaintance I used to think\r\nhe was not very favourably disposed towards me, when I became more\r\nintimately associated with him nothing could exceed his kindness. He\r\nwas universally regretted by Europeans and Natives alike. The soldiers\r\nrecognized that he had carefully guarded their interests and worked\r\nfor their welfare, and the Native Princes and people felt that he\r\nwas in sympathy with them, and to this day they speak of _Lat Napier\r\nSahib_ with the deepest respect and affection.\r\n\r\nLord Napier was succeeded in the command by Sir Frederick Haines.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Now General Lord Chelmsford, G.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: 60th Rifles, 2nd Gurkhas, and 1st Punjab Infantry.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Lumsden returned to Head-Quarters as Adjutant-General\r\non Edwin Johnson being appointed a member of the Indian Council in\r\nLondon.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n1876-1878\r\n\r\n  Lord Lytton becomes Viceroy--Difficulties with Sher Ali\r\n  --Imperial assemblage at Delhi--Reception of the Ruling Chiefs\r\n  --Queen proclaimed Empress of India\r\n  --Political importance of the assemblage\r\n  --Sher Ali proclaims a 'Jahad'--A journey under difficulties\r\n\r\n\r\nWith a new Commander-in-Chief came a new Viceroy, and it was while\r\nwe were in Bombay seeing the last of Lord Napier that the _Orontes_\r\nsteamed into the harbour with Lord Lytton on board. Little did I\r\nimagine when making Lord Lytton's acquaintance how much he would have\r\nto say to my future career.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency received me very kindly, telling me he felt that I was\r\nnot altogether a stranger, as he had been reading during the voyage\r\na paper I had written for Lord Napier, a year or two before, on\r\nour military position in India, and the arrangements that would be\r\nnecessary in the event of Russia attempting to continue her advance\r\nsouth of the Oxus. Lord Napier had sent a copy of this memorandum to\r\nLord Beaconsfield, by whom it had been given to Lord Lytton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIELD-MARSHAL LORD NAPIER OF MAGDALA, G.C.B., G.C.S.I.\r\n_From a photograph by Messrs. Maull and Fox._]\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1876 our frontier policy was frequently under\r\ndiscussion. Sir Bartle Frere wrote two very strong letters after the\r\nConservative Government came into power in 1874, drawing attention\r\nto the danger of our being satisfied with a policy of aloofness, and\r\npointing out the necessity for coming into closer relations with\r\nthe Amir of Afghanistan and the Khan of Khelat. Soon afterwards the\r\nSecretary of State communicated with the Government of India as to the\r\nadvisability of establishing British agents in Afghanistan, and of\r\npersuading the Amir to receive a temporary Embassy at Kabul, as had\r\noriginally been proposed by Lord Northbrook.\r\n\r\nThe members of Lord Northbrook's Council were unanimously opposed to\r\nboth these proposals, but they did not succeed in convincing Lord\r\nSalisbury that the measures were undesirable; and on the resignation\r\nof Lord Northbrook, the new Viceroy was furnished with special\r\ninstructions as to the action which Her Majesty's Government\r\nconsidered necessary in consequence of the activity of Russia in\r\nCentral Asia, and the impossibility of obtaining accurate information\r\nof what was going on in and beyond Afghanistan.\r\n\r\nThe question of the Embassy was dealt with at once; Lord Lytton\r\ndirected a letter to be sent to the Amir announcing his assumption\r\nof the Viceroyalty, and his intention to depute Sir Lewis Pelly to\r\nproceed to Kabul for the purpose of discussing certain matters with\r\nHis Highness.\r\n\r\nTo this communication a most unsatisfactory reply was received, and\r\na second letter was addressed to the Amir, in which he was informed\r\nthat, should he still decline to receive the Viceroy's Envoy after\r\ndeliberately weighing all the considerations commended to his serious\r\nattention, the responsibility of the result would rest entirely on the\r\nGovernment of Afghanistan, which would thus alienate itself from\r\nthe alliance of that Power which was most disposed and best able to\r\nbefriend it.\r\n\r\nThis letter was the cause of considerable excitement in Kabul,\r\nexcitement which ran so high that the necessity for proclaiming a\r\nreligious war was mooted; and, to complicate matters, the Amir at\r\nthis time received overtures from General Kauffmann, the Russian\r\nGovernor-General in Turkestan.\r\n\r\nA delay of six weeks occurred before Sher Ali replied to Lord Lytton's\r\nletter, and then he altogether ignored the Viceroy's proposal to send\r\na Mission to Kabul, merely suggesting that the British Government\r\nshould receive an Envoy from him, or that representatives from both\r\ncountries should meet and hold a conference on the border, or, as\r\nanother alternative, that the British Native Agent at Kabul should\r\nreturn and discuss affairs with the Viceroy.\r\n\r\nThe last suggestion was accepted by the Government of India, and the\r\nagent (Nawab Ata Mahomed Khan) arrived in Simla early in October. The\r\nNawab gave it as his opinion that the Amir's attitude of estrangement\r\nwas due to an accumulation of grievances, the chief of which were--the\r\nunfavourable arbitration in the Sistan dispute; the want of success of\r\nSaiyad Nur Mahomed's mission to India in 1873, when it was the desire\r\nof the Amir's heart to enter into an offensive and defensive alliance\r\nwith the British Government; the interposition of Lord Northbrook's\r\nGovernment on behalf of Yakub Khan;[1] the recent proceedings in\r\nKhelat,[2] which the Amir thought were bringing us objectionably near\r\nKandahar; the transmission of presents through Afghanistan, to his\r\nvassal, the Mir of Wakhan, without the Amir's permission;[3] and,\r\nabove all, the conviction that our policy was exclusively directed to\r\nthe furtherance of British interests without any thought for those of\r\nAfghanistan.\r\n\r\nAs regarded the proposed Mission to Kabul, the Envoy said that His\r\nHighness objected to it for many reasons. Owing to local fanaticism,\r\nhe could not insure its safety, and it seemed probable that, though of\r\na temporary nature to begin with, it might only be the thin end of the\r\nwedge, ending in the establishment of a permanent Resident, as at the\r\ncourts of the Native Rulers in India. Furthermore, the Amir conceived\r\nthat, if he consented to this Mission, the Russians would insist upon\r\ntheir right to send a similar one, and finally, he feared a British\r\nEnvoy might bring his influence to bear in favour of the release of\r\nhis son, Yakub Khan, with whom his relations were as strained as ever.\r\n\r\nIn answer, the Viceroy enumerated the concessions he was prepared to\r\nmake, and the conditions upon which alone he would consent to them;\r\nand this answer the agent was directed to communicate to the Amir.\r\n\r\nThe concessions were as follows:\r\n\r\n  (1) That the friends and enemies of either State should be those of\r\n  the other.\r\n\r\n  (2) That, in the event of unprovoked aggression upon Afghanistan\r\n  from without, assistance should be afforded in men, money, and arms;\r\n  and also that to strengthen the Amir against such aggression, the\r\n  British Government was willing to fortify Herat and other points on\r\n  the frontier, and, if desired, to lend officers to discipline the\r\n  army.\r\n\r\n  (3) That Abdulla Jan should be recognized as the Amir's successor to\r\n  the exclusion of any other aspirant; and that the question of\r\n  material aid in support of such recognition should be discussed by\r\n  the Plenipotentiaries.\r\n\r\n  (4) That a yearly subsidy should be paid to the Amir on the\r\n  following conditions:\r\n\r\n    That he should refrain from external aggression or provocation of\r\n    his neighbours, and from entering into external relations without\r\n    our knowledge.\r\n\r\n    That he should decline all communication with Russia, and refer\r\n    her agents to us.\r\n\r\n    That British agents should reside at Herat and elsewhere on the\r\n    frontier.\r\n\r\n    That a mixed commission of British and Afghan officers should\r\n    determine and demarcate the Amir's frontier.\r\n\r\n    That arrangements should be made, by allowances or otherwise, for\r\n    free circulation of trade on the principal trade routes.\r\n\r\n    That similar arrangements should be made for a line of telegraph,\r\n    the direction of which was to be subsequently determined.\r\n\r\n    That Afghanistan should be freely opened to Englishmen, official\r\n    and non-official, and arrangements made by the Amir, as far as\r\n    practicable, for their safety, though His Highness would not be\r\n    absolutely held responsible for isolated accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Viceroy concluded by suggesting that, if the Amir agreed to these\r\nproposals, a treaty might be arranged between the agents of the\r\nrespective Governments, and ratified either at Peshawar, by the Amir\r\nmeeting Lord Lytton there, or at Delhi if the Amir accepted His\r\nExcellency's invitation to be present at the Imperial Assemblage.\r\n\r\nThe Amir at the time vouchsafed no reply whatever to these proposals\r\nor to the invitation to come to Delhi.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1876 preparations were commenced for the 'Imperial\r\nAssemblage,' which it was announced by the Viceroy would be held\r\nat Delhi on the first day of January, 1877, for the purpose of\r\nproclaiming to the Queen's subjects throughout India the assumption\r\nby Her Majesty of the title of 'Empress of India.' To this Assemblage\r\nLord Lytton further announced that he proposed 'to invite the\r\nGovernors, Lieutenant-Governors, and Heads of Administration from all\r\nparts of the Queen's Indian dominions, as well as the Princes, Chiefs,\r\nand Nobles in whose persons the antiquity of the past is associated\r\nwith the prosperity of the present, and who so worthily contribute to\r\nthe splendour and stability of this great Empire.'\r\n\r\nDelhi was selected as the place where the meeting between the Queen's\r\nrepresentative and the great nobles of India could most appropriately\r\nbe held, and a committee was appointed to make the necessary\r\narrangements. As a member of the committee I was deputed to proceed to\r\nDelhi, settle about the sites for the camps, and carry out all details\r\nin communication with the local authorities. The Viceroy impressed\r\nupon me that the Assemblage was intended to emphasize the Proclamation\r\nLord Canning issued eighteen years before, by which the Queen assumed\r\nthe direct sovereignty of her eastern possessions, and that he wished\r\nno trouble or expense to be spared in making the ceremony altogether\r\nworthy of such a great historical event.\r\n\r\nI returned to Simla in October, when my wife and I accompanied the\r\nCommander-in-Chief on a very delightful march over the Jalauri Pass\r\nthrough the Kulu valley, then over the Bubbu Pass and through the\r\nKangra valley to Chamba and Dalhousie. Our party consisted of the\r\nChief, his Doctor (Bradshaw), Persian interpreter (Moore), General and\r\nMrs. Lumsden, and ourselves. The first slight shower of snow had just\r\nfallen on the Jalauri Pass, and as we crossed over we disturbed a\r\nnumber of beautiful snow-pheasants and minals busily engaged in\r\nscratching it away to get at their food. The scenery on this march is\r\nvery fine and varied; for the most part the timber and foliage are\r\nsuperb, and the valleys are very fertile and pretty, lying close under\r\nthe snow-capped mountains.\r\n\r\nHaving inspected the 'Hill stations,' we proceeded to Peshawar,\r\nwhere the Viceroy had arranged to hold a conference with the\r\nLieutenant-Governor of the Punjab and the Commissioner of Peshawar\r\nabout frontier affairs.\r\n\r\nEarly in December I was back again at Delhi, where I found the\r\narrangements for the several camps progressing most satisfactorily,\r\nand canvas cities rising up in every direction, I had previously\r\nchosen the site of the old cantonment for the camps of the Viceroy,\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief, and the principal officials, while for the\r\nAssemblage itself I had selected ground about three miles off.\r\n\r\nThe Chiefs and Princes were all settled in their several camps ready\r\nto meet the Viceroy, who, on his arrival, in a few graceful words\r\nwelcomed them to Delhi, and thanked them for responding to his\r\ninvitation. He then mounted, with Lady Lytton, on a state elephant,\r\nand a procession was formed, which, I fancy, was about the most\r\ngorgeous and picturesque which has ever been seen even in the East.\r\nThe magnificence of the Native Princes' retinues can hardly be\r\ndescribed; their elephant-housings were of cloth of gold, or\r\nscarlet-and-blue cloths embroidered in gold and silver. The howdahs\r\nwere veritable thrones of the precious metals, shaded by the most\r\nbrilliant canopies, and the war-elephants belonging to some of\r\nthe Central India and Rajputana Chiefs formed a very curious and\r\ninteresting feature. Their tusks were tipped with steel; they wore\r\nshields on their fore-heads, and breastplates of flashing steel;\r\nchain-mail armour hung down over their trunks and covered their backs\r\nand sides; and they were mounted by warriors clad in chain-mail, and\r\narmed to the teeth. Delhi must have witnessed many splendid pageants,\r\nwhen the Rajput, the Moghul, and the Mahratta dynasties, each in its\r\nturn, was at the height of its glory; but never before had Princes and\r\nChiefs of every race and creed come from all parts of Hindustan, vying\r\nwith each other as to the magnificence of their _entourage_, and met\r\ntogether with the same object--that of acknowledging and doing homage\r\nto one supreme Ruler.\r\n\r\nThe next few days were spent by Lord Lytton in receiving the\r\nsixty-three[4] Ruling Princes of India according to the strictest\r\netiquette. Each Prince, with his suite, was met at the entrance to\r\nthe camp, and conducted up the street to the durbar tent by mounted\r\nofficers, the salute to which he was entitled being fired while the\r\nprocession moved on. He was then presented by the Foreign Secretary to\r\nthe Viceroy, who placed him on a chair on his right, immediately\r\nbelow a full-length portrait of Her Majesty. A satin banner, richly\r\nembroidered with the Chief's armorial bearings, surmounted by the\r\nImperial crown, was next brought in by Highland soldiers and planted\r\nin front of the throne, when the Viceroy, leading the particular Chief\r\ntowards it, thus addressed him: 'I present Your Highness with this\r\nbanner as a personal gift from Her Majesty the Queen, in commemoration\r\nof her assumption of the title of Empress of India. Her Majesty trusts\r\nthat it may never be unfurled without reminding you not only of the\r\nclose union between the throne of England and your loyal and princely\r\nhouse, but also of the earnest desire of the paramount power to see\r\nyour dynasty strong, prosperous, and permanent.'\r\n\r\nHis Excellency then placed round the Chief's neck a crimson ribbon, to\r\nwhich was attached a very handsome gold medal[5] with the Queen's head\r\nengraved on it, adding: 'I further decorate you, by command of Her\r\nMajesty. May this medal be long worn by yourself, and long kept as\r\nan heirloom in your family in remembrance of the auspicious date it\r\nbears.'\r\n\r\nThe 1st January, 1877, saw the Queen proclaimed Empress of India, The\r\nceremony was most imposing, and in every way successful. Three tented\r\npavilions had been constructed on an open plain. The throne-pavilion\r\nin the centre was a very graceful erection, brilliant in hangings and\r\nbanners of red, blue, and white satin magnificently embroidered in\r\ngold, with appropriate emblems. It was hexagonal in shape, and rather\r\nmore than 200 feet in circumference. In front of this was the pavilion\r\nfor the Ruling Chiefs and high European officials, in the form of\r\na semicircle 800 feet long. The canopy was of Star of India\r\nblue-and-white satin embroidered in gold, each pillar being surmounted\r\nby an Imperial crown. Behind the throne was the stand for the\r\nspectators, also in the form of a semicircle divided in the middle,\r\nand likewise canopied in brilliant colours. Between these two blocks\r\nwas the entrance to the area.\r\n\r\nEach Chief and high official sat beneath his own banner, which was\r\nplanted immediately behind his chair, and they were all mixed up as\r\nmuch as possible to avoid questions of precedence, the result being\r\nthe most wonderful mass of colour, produced from the intermingling of\r\nBritish uniforms and plumes with gorgeous eastern costumes, set off by\r\na blaze of diamonds and other precious stones.\r\n\r\nAll the British troops brought to Delhi for the occasion were paraded\r\nto the north, and the troops and retainers belonging to the Native\r\nChiefs to the south, of the pavilion. Guards of Honour were drawn up\r\non either side of the throne and at each opening by which the Ruling\r\nChiefs were to enter the pavilion.\r\n\r\nThe guests being all seated, a flourish of trumpets by the heralds\r\nexactly at noon announced the arrival of the Viceroy. The military\r\nbands played a march, and Lord Lytton, accompanied by Lady Lytton,\r\ntheir daughters, and his staff, proceeded to the pavilion. His\r\nExcellency took his seat upon the throne, arrayed in his robes as\r\nGrand Master of the Star of India, the National Anthem was played,\r\nthe Guards of Honour presented arms, while the whole of the vast\r\nassemblage rose as one man. The Chief Herald was then commanded to\r\nread the Proclamation. A flourish of trumpets was again sounded, and\r\nHer Majesty was proclaimed Empress of India.\r\n\r\nWhen the Chief Herald had ceased reading, the Royal Standard was\r\nhoisted, and a salute of 101 salvoes of artillery was fired, with a\r\n_feu de joie_ from the long line of troops. This was too much for the\r\nelephants. As the _feu de joie_ approached nearer and nearer to\r\nthem they became more and more alarmed, and at last scampered off,\r\ndispersing the crowd in every direction. When it ceased they were\r\nquieted and brought back by their _mahouts_, only to start off again\r\nwhen the firing recommenced; but, as it was a perfectly bare plain,\r\nwithout anything for the great creatures to come in contact with,\r\nthere was no harm done beyond a severe shaking to their riders. As\r\nthe sound of the last salvo died away the Viceroy addressed the\r\nassemblage. When he had ceased speaking, the assembly again rose _en\r\nmasse_ and joined the troops in giving several ringing cheers.\r\n\r\nHis Highness the Maharaja Sindhia then spoke as follows: '_Shah in\r\nShah Padishah_. May God bless you. The Princes of India bless you, and\r\npray that your sovereignty and power may remain steadfast for ever.'\r\n\r\nSir Salar Jung rose on behalf of the boy Nizam, and said: 'I am\r\ndesired by His Highness the Nizam to request your Excellency to convey\r\nto Her Majesty, on the part of himself and the Chiefs of India, the\r\nexpression of their hearty congratulations on the assumption of the\r\ntitle of Empress of India, and to assure the Queen that they pray for\r\nher, and for the enduring prosperity of her Empire, both in India and\r\nEngland.'\r\n\r\nThe Maharajas of Udaipur and Jaipur, in the name of the united Chiefs\r\nof Rajputana, begged that a telegram might be sent to the Queen,\r\nconveying their dutiful and loyal congratulations; and the Maharaja\r\nof Kashmir expressed his gratification at the tenor of the Viceroy's\r\nspeech, and declared that he should henceforth consider himself secure\r\nunder the shadow of Her Majesty's protecting care.[6]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EARL OF LYTTON, G.C.B., G.M.S.I., G.M.I.E., VICEROY\r\nor INDIA.\r\n_From a photograph by Messrs. Maull and Fox._]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to overrate the political importance of this great\r\ngathering. It was looked upon by most of the Ruling Chiefs as the\r\nresult of the Prince of Wales's visit, and rejoiced in as an evidence\r\nof Her Majesty's increased interest in, and appreciation of, the vast\r\nEmpire of India with its many different races and peoples.\r\n\r\nI visited all the camps, and conversed with every one of the Princes\r\nand Nobles, and each in turn expressed the same intense gratification\r\nat the Viceroy's reception of him, the same fervent loyalty to the\r\nEmpress, and the same satisfaction that the new title should have been\r\nannounced with such appropriate splendour and publicity.\r\n\r\nGeneral rejoicings in honour of the occasion took place all over\r\nIndia, in Native States as well as British cantonments. School-houses,\r\ntown halls, hospitals, and dispensaries were founded, large numbers of\r\nprisoners were released, substantial additions were made to the pay of\r\nall ranks in the Native Army, as well as a considerable increase in\r\nnumbers to the Order of British India; and the amnesty granted in 1859\r\nwas extended to all but murderers and leaders in the Mutiny.\r\n\r\nWhen the Assemblage broke up, I started with Sir Frederick Haines\r\nfor a tour along the Derajat frontier. We visited Kohat, Bannu, Dera\r\nIsmail Khan, and Multan; proceeded by steamer down the Indus to\r\nSukkur, and thence rode to Jacobabad. Then on to Kotri, from which\r\nplace we went to see the battle-field of Miani, where Sir Charles\r\nNapier defeated the Amirs of Sind in 1843. From Kotri we travelled\r\nto Simla _viâ_ Karachi and Bombay, where we were most hospitably\r\nentertained by the Commander-in-Chief of Bombay (Sir Charles Stavely)\r\nand his wife.\r\n\r\nAfghan affairs were this year again giving the Viceroy a great deal\r\nof anxiety. The Amir had eventually agreed to a discussion of Lord\r\nLytton's proposals being held, and for this purpose Saiyad Nur Mahomed\r\nand Sir Lewis Pelly had met at Peshawar in January, 1877. The\r\nmeeting, unfortunately, ended in a rupture, owing to Sher Ali's\r\nagent pronouncing the location of European officers in any part of\r\nAfghanistan an impossibility; and what at this crisis complicated\r\nmatters to a most regrettable extent was the death of Saiyad Nur\r\nMahomed, who had been in failing health for some time.\r\n\r\nOn learning the death of his most trusted Minister, and the failure of\r\nthe negotiations, Sher Ali broke into a violent fit of passion, giving\r\nvent to his fury in threatenings and invectives against the British\r\nGovernment. He declared it was not possible to come to terms, and that\r\nthere was nothing left for him but to fight; that he had seven crores\r\nof rupees, every one of which he would hurl at the heads of the\r\nEnglish, and he ended by giving orders for a _jahad_ (a religious war)\r\nto be proclaimed.\r\n\r\nFor the time being nothing more could be done with Afghanistan, and\r\nthe Viceroy was able to turn his attention to the following important\r\nquestions: the transfer of Sind from Bombay to the Punjab, a measure\r\nwhich had been unanimously agreed to by Lord Northbrook's Government;\r\nthe removal from the Punjab government of the trans-Indus tract of\r\ncountry, and the formation of the latter into a separate district\r\nunder the control of a Chief Commissioner, who would be responsible\r\nto the Government of India alone for frontier administration and\r\ntrans-frontier relations. This post Lord Lytton told me, as much to my\r\nsurprise as to my gratification, that he meant to offer to me, if his\r\nviews were accepted by the Secretary of State. It was above all others\r\nthe appointment I should have liked. I delighted in frontier life and\r\nfrontier men, who, with all their faults, are men, and grand men, too.\r\nI had felt for years what an important factor the trans-Indus tribes\r\nare in the defence of India, and how desirable it was that we should\r\nbe on better terms with them than was possible so long as our policy\r\nconsisted in keeping them at arm's length, and our only intercourse\r\nwith them was confined to punitive expeditions or the visits of their\r\nhead-men to our hard-worked officials, whose whole time was occupied\r\nin writing long reports, or in settling troublesome disputes to the\r\nsatisfaction of no one.\r\n\r\nI now hoped to be able to put a stop to the futile blockades and\r\ninconclusive reprisals which had been carried on for nearly thirty\r\nyears with such unsatisfactory results, and I looked forward to\r\nturning the wild tribesmen from enemies into friends, a strength\r\ninstead of a weakness, to our Government, and to bringing them by\r\ndegrees within the pale of civilization. My wife quite shared my\r\nfeelings, and we were both eager to begin our frontier life.\r\n\r\nAs a preliminary to my engaging in this congenial employment, Lord\r\nLytton proposed that I should take up the command of the Punjab\r\nFrontier Force. I gladly acquiesced; for I had been a long time on the\r\nstaff, and had had three years of the Quartermaster-Generalship.\r\nMy friends expressed surprise at my accepting the position of\r\nBrigadier-General, after having filled an appointment carrying with it\r\nthe rank of Major-General; but this was not my view. I longed for\r\na command, and the Frontier Force offered opportunities for active\r\nservice afforded by no other post.\r\n\r\nWe were in Calcutta when the question was decided, and started very\r\nsoon afterwards to make our arrangements for the breaking up of our\r\nhome at Simla. I took over the command of the Force on the 15th March,\r\n1878. My wife accompanied me to Abbottabad--the pretty, quiet little\r\nplace in Hazara, about 4,000 feet above the sea, which was to be\r\nhenceforth our winter head-quarters. For the summer months we were to\r\nbe located in the higher hills, and my wife was anxious to see the\r\nhouse which I had purchased from my predecessor, General Keyes, at\r\nNatiagali. So off we set, nothing daunted by being told that we were\r\nlikely to find snow still deep in places.\r\n\r\nFor the first part of the way we got on well enough, my wife in a\r\ndandy, I riding, and thirteen miles were accomplished without much\r\ndifficulty. Suddenly the road took a bend, and we found ourselves in\r\ndeep snow. Riding soon proved to be impossible, and the dandy-bearers\r\ncould not carry my wife further; so there was nothing for it but to\r\nwalk. We were seven miles from our destination, and at each step we\r\nsank into the snow, which became deeper and deeper the higher we\r\nascended. On we trudged, till my wife declared she could go no\r\nfurther, and sat down to rest, feeling so drowsy that she entreated me\r\nto let her stay where she was. Fortunately I had a small flask with\r\nme filled with brandy. I poured a little into the cup, mixed it with\r\nsnow, and administered it as a stimulant. This restored her somewhat,\r\nand roused her from the state of lethargy into which she had fallen.\r\nAgain we struggled on. Soon it became dark, except for such light as\r\nthe stars, aided by the snow, afforded. More than once I despaired\r\nof reaching the end of our journey; but, just as I had become quite\r\nhopeless, we saw lights on the hill above us, and heard our servants,\r\nwho had preceded us, shouting to attract our attention. I answered,\r\nand presently they came to our assistance. Half carrying, half\r\ndragging her, we got my wife up the steep mountain-side; and at\r\nlength, about 9 p.m., we arrived at the little house buried in snow,\r\ninto which we crept through a hole dug in the snow wall, which\r\nencircled it. We were welcomed by a blazing wood-fire and a most\r\ncheering odour of dinner, to which we did full justice, after having\r\ngot rid of our saturated garments. Next morning we started on our\r\nreturn journey at daybreak, for it was necessary to get over the worst\r\npart of the road before the sun had had time to soften the snow, which\r\nthe night's frost had so thoroughly hardened that we slipped over it\r\nwithout the least difficulty.\r\n\r\nThis was our only visit to our new possession, for very soon\r\nafterwards I was informed that Lord Lytton wished me to spend the\r\nsummer at Simla, as the Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab would be\r\nthere, and His Excellency was anxious to discuss the details of the\r\nproposed Chief Commissionership. My wife, therefore, returned to Simla\r\nat once, and I joined her at the end of May, having in the meanwhile\r\ninspected every regiment and visited every post held by the Frontier\r\nForce between Sind and Hazara--a most interesting experience, which I\r\nthoroughly enjoyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Amir's eldest son, who had rebelled on his younger\r\nbrother, Abdulla Jan, being nominated heir to the throne.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Before Lord Northbrook left India he sent Major Sandeman\r\non a Mission to Khelat to re-open the Bolan Pass, and endeavour to\r\nsettle the differences between the Khan and the Baluchistan tribes,\r\nand between the tribes themselves, who were all at loggerheads.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Presents given by the British Government to the Mir of\r\nWakhan in recognition of his hospitable reception of the members of\r\nthe Forsyth Mission on their return from Yarkund.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: 'Besides the sixty-three Ruling Chiefs, there were nearly\r\nthree hundred titular Chiefs and persons of distinction collected\r\nat the Imperial Assemblage, besides those included in the suites\r\nof Ruling Chiefs.--J.

The French were our only European rivals in India, and\r\nthe advance of Russia towards the Oxus was as little anticipated as\r\nwas England's advance towards the Indus.\r\n\r\nThirty years later Russia began to absorb the hordes of the Kirghiz\r\nsteppes, which gave her occupation for more than a hundred years,\r\nduring which time England was far from idle. Bengal was conquered, or\r\nceded to us, the Madras Presidency established, and Bombay had become\r\nan important settlement, with the result that, in the early part of\r\nthis century, the distance between the Russian and English possessions\r\nhad been diminished to less than 2,000 miles.\r\n\r\nOur progress was now more rapid. While Russia was laboriously\r\ncrossing a barren desert, the North-West Provinces, the Carnatic, the\r\nterritories of the Peshwa, Sind, and the Punjab, successively came\r\nunder our rule, and by 1850 we had extended our dominions to the foot\r\nof the mountains beyond the Indus.\r\n\r\nRussia by this time, having overcome the difficulties of the desert,\r\nhad established herself at Aralsk, near the junction of the Syr Daria\r\nwith the waters of Lake Aral; so that in fifty years the distance\r\nbetween the outposts of the two advancing Powers in Asia had been\r\nreduced to about 1,000 miles.\r\n\r\nRepeated successful wars with Persia, and our desertion of that Power\r\nowing to the conviction that we could no longer defend her against\r\nthe Russians, had practically placed her at their mercy, and they had\r\ninduced Persia, in 1837, to undertake the siege of Herat. At the\r\nsame time, the Russian Ambassador at Teheran had despatched Captain\r\nVitkievitch to Kabul with letters from himself and from the Czar\r\nto the Amir, in the hope of getting Dost Mahomed Khan to join the\r\nRussians and Persians in their alliance against the English.\r\n\r\nVitkievitch's arrival at Kabul towards the end of 1837 had been\r\nanticipated by Captain (afterwards Sir Alexander) Burnes, who had been\r\nsent three months before by Lord Auckland on a Mission to the Amir,\r\nostensibly to improve our commercial relations with the Afghans, but\r\nin reality to prevent them from joining the Russo-Persian alliance.\r\n\r\nBurnes had been most cordially received by Dost Mahomed, who hoped,\r\nwith the help of the Indian Government, to recover the district of\r\nPeshawar, which had been wrested from him by the Sikhs. Vitkievitch's\r\nreception was proportionately discouraging, and for some weeks he\r\ncould not obtain an interview with the Amir.\r\n\r\nThe Dost's hopes, however, were not fulfilled. We declined to give him\r\nany assistance towards regaining possession of Peshawar or defending\r\nhis dominions, should his refusal to join with Persia and Russia draw\r\ndown upon him the enmity of those Powers.\r\n\r\nVitkievitch, who had been patiently biding his time, was now taken\r\ninto favour by the Amir, who accorded him a reception which fully\r\ncompensated for the neglect with which he had previously been treated.\r\n\r\nBurnes remained at Kabul until the spring of 1838, and then returned\r\nto India to report that Dost Mahomed had thrown himself heart and soul\r\ninto the Russo-Persian alliance.\r\n\r\nUnder pressure from the English Ministry the Governor-General of India\r\ndetermined to take the extreme measure of deposing an Amir who had\r\nshown himself so hostilely inclined, and of placing on the throne\r\nof Kabul a Ruler who, it was hoped, would feel that it was to his\r\ninterest to keep on good terms with us. It was for this object that\r\nthe first Afghan war[1] was undertaken, which ended in the murder of\r\nour nominee, Shah Shuja, and the triumphant return of Dost Mahomed.\r\nThe disastrous failure of our action in this matter taught the British\r\nGovernment that our frontier on the Sutlej was too far removed for us\r\nto think of exercising any real influence in Afghanistan, and that the\r\ntime had not arrived to warrant our interfering in Afghan affairs.\r\n\r\nAfter this came our war with the Sikhs, resulting in our conquest\r\nof the Punjab, and our frontier becoming conterminous with that of\r\nAfghanistan on the banks of the Indus.\r\n\r\nThere was a lull in the movements of Russia in Central Asia until\r\nafter the Crimean War of 1854-56, which, while temporarily checking\r\nthe designs of Russia in Europe, seems to have stimulated her progress\r\nin the East. After the passage of the great desert, Russia found\r\nherself in the midst of fertile and settled countries, whose provinces\r\nfell under her control as rapidly as those of India had fallen under\r\nours, until in 1864 Chimkent was occupied, the point beyond which\r\nPrince Gortchakoff stated that there was no intention on the part of\r\nRussia to make further advances.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these assurances, Tashkent was captured on the\r\n29th June of the following year. In 1866 Khojent was successfully\r\nassaulted. Tisakh fell on the 30th October; and in the spring of\r\n1867 the fort of Yani-Kargan in the Nurata mountains was seized and\r\noccupied.\r\n\r\nBokhara alone remained unconquered, but the Ruler of that State, after\r\nvainly endeavouring to gain assistance from Afghanistan and to enlist\r\nthe sympathies of the Indian Government, was compelled to sue for\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nImportant as these acquisitions were, they attracted but little\r\nattention in England, owing partly to the policy of non-interference\r\nwhich had been adopted as regards Central Asian affairs, and partly to\r\nthe British public being absorbed in European politics, until 1868,\r\nwhen the occupation of Samarkand by Russia caused considerable\r\nexcitement, not to say consternation, amongst the authorities in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nConferences took place in the spring of 1870 between Lord Clarendon,\r\nthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and Baron Brunow, the\r\nRussian Ambassador, with the object of determining a neutral zone,\r\nwhich should be the limit of the possessions of England and Russia in\r\nCentral Asia. For nearly three years, Russia was persistent in her\r\nendeavours to have Afghanistan placed outside the pale of British\r\ninfluence; but the Indian Government were equally persistent in\r\npointing out the danger of agreeing to such an arrangement, and it was\r\nnot until the 31st January, 1873, that the boundary, which neither\r\nEngland nor Russia might cross, was finally agreed upon.\r\n\r\nSix months later the conquest of Khiva by Russia was effected. It\r\nwas at first given out that the expedition was to punish acts of\r\nbrigandage, and to rescue fifty Russian prisoners, but was on no\r\naccount to lead to a prolonged occupancy of the Khanate. Count\r\nSchouvaloff, the Russian Statesman who was deputed to communicate the\r\nobject of the expedition to the British Government, declared that a\r\npositive promise to this effect might be given to the British public,\r\nas a proof of the friendly and pacific intentions of his master the\r\nCzar; but, notwithstanding these assurances, the Russians never left\r\nKhiva, and it has been a Russian possession from that time.\r\n\r\nThus, in a little more than twenty years, Russia had made a stride of\r\n600 miles towards India, leaving but 400 miles between her outposts\r\nand those of Great Britain. Russia's southern boundary was now, in\r\nfact, almost conterminous with the northern boundary of Afghanistan,\r\nnear enough to cause the Ruler of that country considerable anxiety,\r\nand make him feel that Russia had become a dreaded neighbour, and that\r\nthe integrity of his kingdom could not be maintained save by the\r\naid of one of the two great Powers between whose fire he now found\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to show how it was that Sher Ali, notwithstanding\r\nhis soreness and disappointment at the many rebuffs he had received\r\nfrom us in the earlier part of his career, gratefully remembered\r\nthe timely aid afforded him by Sir John Lawrence, and the princely\r\nreception accorded to him by Lord Mayo, and was still quite prepared\r\nin 1873 to enter into friendly relations with us, provided we would\r\nrecognize his favourite son as his heir, and give a direct promise of\r\naid in the event of Russian aggression. Our refusal to accede to these\r\nterms, added to our adverse decision in regard to the Sistan boundary,\r\nturned Sher Ali from a friend into an enemy, and he decided, as his\r\nfather had done forty years before, to throw in his lot with Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It is instructive to note how remarkably similar were the\r\ncircumstances which brought about the first and second Afghan wars,\r\nviz., the presence of Russian officers at Kabul.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n1878\r\n\r\n  Effect of the Berlin Treaty at Kabul\r\n  --Sher Ali decides against England--A meeting of portentous moment\r\n  --Preparations for war--Letter from Sher Ali\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1877 Russia declared war with Turkey; for more than a year fighting\r\nhad been going on between the two countries, and as it seemed possible\r\nto the British Government that England might in the end be drawn into\r\nthe contest, it was deemed expedient to obtain help from India, and\r\na force of about 5,000 Native soldiers was despatched from Bombay to\r\nMalta in response to the demand from home.\r\n\r\nRussia answered this move on our part by increased activity in\r\nCentral Asia; and in June, 1878, it was reported by Major Cavagnari,\r\nDeputy-Commissioner of Peshawar, that a Russian Envoy of the same rank\r\nas the Governor-General of Tashkent was about to visit Kabul, and\r\nthat General Kauffmann had written to the Amir that the Envoy must\r\nbe received as an Ambassador deputed by the Czar himself. A few days\r\nlater further reports were received of Russian troops being mobilized,\r\nand of the intention of Russia to establish cantonments on the ferries\r\nof Kilif and Kerki on the Oxus.\r\n\r\nThe Amir, it was said, summoned a council of the leading Chiefs,\r\nto discuss the question whether it would be most advantageous for\r\nAfghanistan at this juncture to side with Russia or with England; it\r\nwas decided apparently in favour of the former, for from the moment\r\nGeneral Stolietoff's Mission set foot on Afghan territory it met with\r\nan enthusiastic reception. Five miles from the capital Stolietoff and\r\nhis companions were welcomed by the Foreign Secretary. They were then\r\nmounted on richly-caparisoned elephants, and escorted by a large body\r\nof troops to the Bala Hissar, where the following morning they were\r\nreceived in state by Sher Ali, and the nobles of highest degree in his\r\nkingdom.[1]\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the day that the Mission entered Kabul, Stolietoff\r\nreceived a despatch from General Kauffmann giving him the heads of the\r\nBerlin Treaty, with the following commentary in the handwriting of\r\nthe Governor-General himself: 'If the news be true, it is indeed\r\nmelancholy;' adding, however, that the Congress had finished its\r\nsittings, and that, therefore, the Envoy in his negotiations with\r\nthe Amir had better refrain from arranging any distinct measures, or\r\nmaking any positive promises, and '_not go generally as far as would\r\nhave been advisable if war with England had been threatened_.'\r\nEvidently these instructions greatly modified the basis of\r\nStolietoff's negotiations with Sher Ali; for, although the Russians\r\ndeny that an offensive and defensive alliance with the Afghan Ruler\r\nwas contemplated, it seems probable, from the tone of Kauffmann's\r\ndespatch, that the Envoy's instructions were elastic enough to admit\r\nof such an arrangement had the circumstances of the case made it\r\ndesirable--_e.g._, had the Berlin Congress failed to establish peace\r\nin Europe.\r\n\r\nIn telegraphing to the Secretary of State an account of these\r\nproceedings at Kabul, the Viceroy requested explicit instructions from\r\nHer Majesty's Government as to whether this conduct on the part of\r\nRussia and Afghanistan was to be left to the Government of India to\r\ndeal with as a matter between it and the Amir, or whether, having\r\nregard to Russia's formal promises, it would be treated as an Imperial\r\nquestion. 'In the former case,' he concluded, 'I shall propose, with\r\nyour approval, to insist on an immediate suitable reception of a\r\nBritish Mission.'\r\n\r\nLord Lytton's proposition was approved of by Her Majesty's Ministers,\r\nand a letter[2] was at once written by the Viceroy to the Amir,\r\nannouncing that a Mission would shortly be despatched to Kabul with\r\nGeneral Sir Neville Chamberlain, at that time Commander-in-Chief in\r\nMadras, as its responsible head.\r\n\r\nMajor Cavagnari was at the same time directed to inform the\r\nauthorities at Kabul that the object of the Mission was altogether\r\nfriendly, and that a refusal to grant it a free passage and safe\r\nconduct, such as had been accorded to the Russian Envoy, would be\r\nconsidered as an act of open hostility. Intimation of the Viceroy's\r\nintentions reached Kabul on the 17th August, the day on which the\r\nAmir's favourite son, Abdulla Jan, died. This untoward event was taken\r\nadvantage of to delay answering the Viceroy's letter, but it was not\r\nallowed in any way to interfere with the progress of the negotiations\r\nwith Russia. When these were completed, Stolietoff inquired from Sher\r\nAli whether he meant to receive the English Mission, whereupon the\r\nAmir asked for the General's advice in the matter. Stolietoff, while\r\nreplying somewhat evasively, gave Sher Ali to understand that the\r\nsimultaneous presence of Embassies from two countries in almost\r\nhostile relations with each other would not be quite convenient, upon\r\nwhich His Highness decided not to allow the British Mission to enter\r\nAfghanistan. This decision, however, was not communicated to the\r\nViceroy, and on the 21st September the Mission[3] marched out of\r\nPeshawar and encamped at Jamrud, three miles short of the Kyber Pass.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the extremely hostile attitude of the Amir, and the\r\nvery unsatisfactory reply received from General Faiz Mahomed Khan,\r\ncommanding the Afghan troops in the Kyber Pass, to a letter[4] he had\r\nwritten a few days before, Sir Neville Chamberlain suspected that the\r\nadvance of the Mission would be opposed, and, in order 'to reduce to\r\na minimum any indignity that might be offered to our Government,' he\r\ndeputed Major Cavagnari to ride on with a few sowars to Ali Masjid, a\r\nfort ten miles beyond the mouth of the Pass, and demand leave for the\r\nMission to proceed.\r\n\r\nWhen within a mile of the fort, Cavagnari was met by a body of\r\nAfridis, who warned him that the road ahead was blocked by Afghans,\r\nand that if he ventured further he would be fired upon. On this\r\nCavagnari halted, and while in the act of writing a letter to Faiz\r\nMahomed, complaining of the treatment he had met with, and informing\r\nhim that he and his companions intended to proceed until fired upon,\r\nan act the responsibility for which would rest with the Amir's\r\nrepresentatives, a message was brought him from Faiz Mahomed to the\r\neffect that he was coming to meet him, and would hear anything he had\r\nto communicate.\r\n\r\nThe interview took place near a water-mill on the right bank of the\r\nstream which flows under Ali Masjid. I have several times since ridden\r\npast the spot and pictured to myself the meeting between the British\r\npolitical officer and the Afghan General. It was a meeting of most\r\nportentous moment, for its result would mean peace or war.\r\n\r\nFaiz Mahomed's bearing was perfectly courteous, but he made it clear\r\nthat he did not intend to permit the Mission to pass, explaining that\r\nhe was only acting as a sentry under instructions from Kabul, and\r\nthat he was bound to resist the entrance of the Mission into\r\nAfghan territory with all the force at his disposal. He spoke with\r\nconsiderable warmth, and told Cavagnari that but for their personal\r\nfriendship he would, in obedience to the Amir's orders, have shot down\r\nhim and his escort.\r\n\r\nFaiz Mahomed's followers were not so respectful in their bearing as\r\ntheir Chief, and their manner warned Cavagnari that it was unadvisable\r\nto prolong the conversation; he, therefore, took leave of the Afghan\r\nGeneral, and returned to Jamrud. The Mission was dissolved,[5] our\r\nAgent at Kabul was ordered to return to India, and Cavagnari was\r\ninstructed to remain at Peshawar and arrange for alienating the\r\nAfridis in the Khyber from the Amir's interests.\r\n\r\nIn reporting these circumstances to the Secretary of State, the\r\nGovernment of India expressed their regret that this final endeavour\r\non their part to arrive at some definite understanding with the Amir\r\nof Kabul should have been thus met with repudiation and affront, and\r\nconcluded their despatch in the following words: 'The repulse of Sir\r\nNeville Chamberlain by Sher Ali at his frontier while the Russian\r\nemissaries are still at his capital has proved the inutility of\r\ndiplomatic expedients, and has deprived the Amir of all claim upon our\r\nfurther forbearance.'\r\n\r\nIt had been arranged that, if it were unfortunately found to be\r\nnecessary to support political efforts by military measures, two\r\ncolumns should be mobilized, one at Sukkur on the Indus, for an\r\nadvance in the direction of Kandahar, the other at Kohat for\r\noperations in the Kuram valley, and that I was to have command of the\r\nlatter. As soon, therefore, as the tidings of Sir Neville's repulse\r\nwas received, I started from Simla to be on the spot in case the\r\nproposal to employ force should be sanctioned by the authorities in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nBetween the time of my leaving Simla and my arrival at Kohat on\r\nthe 9th October, it was decided to employ a third column to make\r\na demonstration in the direction of the Khyber for the purpose of\r\nclearing the Amir's troops out of the pass.[6]\r\n\r\nThe formation of this column was no doubt a wise move, as the Afghans\r\nwere holding Ali Masjid, the spot on which the insult had been offered\r\nto our Envoy, and the presence of a force on this line would tend to\r\nrelieve the pressure against my column; but looked at from my point of\r\nview, this third column was not quite so desirable, as it involved the\r\nwithdrawal of three of my most efficient regiments, and the transfer\r\nof a large number of my transport animals to the Khyber for its use.\r\nThere was some consolation, however, in the fact that my old friend\r\nMajor-General Sir Samuel Browne, who had been named for the command in\r\nthe Khyber, was to be the gainer by my loss.\r\n\r\nMajor-General Donald Stewart, who was in England, was telegraphed for\r\nto command the Kandahar column, the advanced portion of which, it was\r\nintended, should push on under Major-General Biddulph to strengthen\r\nQuetta.\r\n\r\nThe long-expected reply[7] from the Amir to the Viceroy's letter of\r\nthe 14th August was received at Simla on the 19th October. Its tone\r\nwas considered extremely discourteous; it contained no apology for the\r\npublic affront offered to the British Government, and indicated no\r\ndesire for improved relations.\r\n\r\nThe reply was at once communicated to the Secretary of State, who was\r\nfurther informed that the Government of India proposed the following\r\nmeasures:--\r\n\r\n    The immediate issue of a manifesto which should define the cause\r\n    of offence, declare a friendly disposition towards the Afghan\r\n    people and reluctance to interfere in their internal affairs, and\r\n    should fix the whole responsibility of what might happen upon the\r\n    Amir.\r\n\r\n    An advance into the Kuram valley as soon as the force at Kohat was\r\n    ready to move.\r\n\r\n    The expulsion of the Afghan troops holding the Khyber Pass.\r\n\r\n    An advance from Quetta into Pishin, or, if necessary, to Kandahar.\r\n\r\nLord Cranbrook (who had succeeded the Marquis of Salisbury as\r\nSecretary of State for India) replied[8] that he did not consider\r\nmatters to be at present ripe for taking the extreme measures\r\nrecommended by the Government of India, and that, before crossing the\r\nfrontiers of Afghanistan, a letter should be addressed to the Amir\r\ndemanding, in temperate language, an apology, and the acceptance of a\r\npermanent Mission within Afghan limits; that sufficient time should be\r\ngiven for the receipt of a reply to this letter (the text of which was\r\nto be telegraphed to Lord Cranbrook for approval before despatch), and\r\nthat meanwhile the massing of troops should be continued, and adequate\r\nforces assembled at the various points where the frontier would be\r\ncrossed if war were declared. The Secretary of State went on to say:\r\n'There must be no mistake as to our show of power to enforce what we\r\nrequire; this _locus penitentiæ _should be allowed before hostile acts\r\nare committed against the Amir.'\r\n\r\nThese instructions were carried out, and on the 30th October the\r\nultimatum was despatched to Sher Ali, informing him that, unless his\r\nacceptance of the conditions were received by the Viceroy not later\r\nthan the 20th November, he would be treated by the British Government\r\nas a declared enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: On the 13th June, the day on which the Berlin Congress\r\nheld its first sitting, the news of the approach of General\r\nStolietoff's Mission reached Kabul. The Russians hoped that the\r\nMission might influence the decision of the Berlin Congress, and\r\nalthough its despatch was repudiated by the Imperial Government at St.\r\nPetersburg, it was subsequently ascertained on excellent authority\r\nthat the project of sending a Mission to Kabul was discussed three\r\ntimes at the Council of Ministers, and, according to a statement in\r\nthe _Journal de St. Petersbourg_, orders were sent in April, 1878, to\r\nGeneral Kauffmann regarding its despatch. About the same time, the\r\nRussian Minister of War proposed that the Army of the Caucasus should\r\nbe transferred bodily across the Caspian to Astrabad, whence the\r\ntroops would march in two columns on Herat; while three columns,\r\namounting in the aggregate to 14,000 men, were to move direct upon the\r\nOxus from Turkestan. The main part of this scheme was never carried\r\ninto effect, probably from its being found too great an undertaking at\r\na time when Russia had scarcely obtained a footing beyond the Caspian,\r\nbut the minor movement was partially carried out. The largest of the\r\nthree columns, under Kauffmann's own command, moved from Tashkent,\r\nthrough Samarkand, to Jam, the most southern point of the Russian\r\npossessions at that time, and within ten marches of Kilif, the main\r\nferry over the Oxus. There it remained for some weeks, when it\r\nreturned to Tashkent, the Afghan expedition being abandoned in\r\nconsequence of the Treaty of Berlin having been signed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2:\r\n\r\n    'SIMLA,\r\n    '14_th August,_ 1878.\r\n\r\n    'The authentic intelligence which I have lately received of the\r\n    course of recent events at Kabul and in the countries bordering on\r\n    Afghanistan has rendered it necessary that I should communicate\r\n    fully and without reserve with your Highness upon matters\r\n    of importance which concern the interests of India and of\r\n    Afghanistan.

As, however, information has\r\n    now been received that you have summoned from Peshawar the Khyber\r\n    headmen with whom we were making arrangements for the safe conduct\r\n    of the British Mission through the Khyber Pass, I therefore write\r\n    to inquire from you whether, in accordance with the instructions\r\n    you have received, you are prepared to guarantee the safety of the\r\n    British Mission to Daka or not; and I request that a clear reply\r\n    to this inquiry may be speedily communicated by the hand of\r\n    the bearer of this letter, as I cannot delay my departure from\r\n    Peshawar. It is well known that the Khyber tribes are in receipt\r\n    of allowances from the Kabul Government, and also, like other\r\n    independent tribes on this frontier, have relations with the\r\n    British Government. It may be well to let you know that when the\r\n    present negotiations were opened with the Khyber tribes, it was\r\n    solely with the object of arranging with them for the safe conduct\r\n    of the British Mission through the Khyber Pass, in the same manner\r\n    as was done in regard to the despatch of our Agent, the Nawab\r\n    Ghulam Hussein Khan; and the tribes were given clearly to\r\n    understand that these negotiations were in no way intended to\r\n    prejudice their relations with His Highness the Amir, as it was\r\n    well known that the object of the British Mission was altogether\r\n    of a friendly character to His Highness the Amir and the people of\r\n    Afghanistan.\r\n\r\n    'I trust that, in accordance with the instructions you have\r\n    received from His Highness the Amir, your reply to this letter\r\n    will be satisfactory, and that it will contain the required\r\n    assurances that the Mission will be safely conducted to Daka. I\r\n    shall expect to receive your reply to this letter not later than\r\n    the 18th instant, so please understand that the matter is most\r\n    urgent.\r\n\r\n    'But at the same time, it is my duty to inform you, in a frank and\r\n    friendly manner, that if your answer is not what I trust it will\r\n    be, or if you delay to send an early reply, I shall have no\r\n    alternative but to make whatever arrangements may seem to me best\r\n    for carrying out the instructions I have received from my own\r\n    Government.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: In a letter to Lord Lytton reporting the rebuff the\r\nMission had encountered, General Chamberlain wrote: 'No man was ever\r\nmore anxious than I to preserve peace and secure friendly solution,\r\nand it was only when I plainly saw the Amir's fixed intention to drive\r\nus into a corner that I told you we must either sink into a position\r\nof merely obeying his behests on all points or stand on our rights\r\nand risk rupture. Nothing could have been more distinct, nothing more\r\nhumiliating to the dignity of the British Crown and nation; and I\r\nbelieve that but for the decision and tact of Cavagnari at one period\r\nof the interview, the lives of the British officers and the Native\r\nfollowing were in considerable danger.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The approximate strength of the three columns was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                                    _Officers._  _Men._  _Guns._\r\n\r\n  I.

'Your Excellency's despatch regarding the\r\n    sending of a friendly Mission has been received through Nawab\r\n    Gholam Hussein Khan; I understand its purport, but the Nawab had\r\n    not yet an audience, nor had your Excellency's letters been seen\r\n    by me when a communication was received to the address of my\r\n    servant, Mirza Habibulla Khan, from the Commissioner of Peshawar,\r\n    and was read. I am astonished and dismayed by this letter,\r\n    written threateningly to a well-intentioned friend, replete with\r\n    contentions, and yet nominally regarding a friendly Mission.\r\n    Coming thus by force, what result, or profit, or fruit, could come\r\n    of it? Following this, three other letters from above-mentioned\r\n    source, in the very same strain, addressed to my officials, have\r\n    been perused by me. Thus, during a period of a few days several\r\n    letters from that quarter have all been before me, and none\r\n    of them have been free from harsh expressions and hard words,\r\n    repugnant to courtesy and politeness, and in tone contrary to the\r\n    ways of friendship and intercourse. Looking to the fact that I\r\n    am at this time assaulted by affliction and grief at the hand of\r\n    fate, and that great trouble has possessed my soul, in the\r\n    officials of the British Government patience and silence would\r\n    have been specially becoming. Let your Excellency take into\r\n    consideration this harsh and breathless haste with which the\r\n    desired object and place of conference have been seized upon, and\r\n    how the officials of the Government have been led into discussion\r\n    and subjection to reproach. There is some difference between this\r\n    and the pure road of friendship and goodwill. In alluding to those\r\n    writings of the officials of the opposite Government which have\r\n    emanated from them, and are at this time in the possession of\r\n    my own officials, the latter have in no respect desired to show\r\n    enmity or opposition towards the British Government, nor, indeed,\r\n    do they with any other Power desire enmity or strife; but when any\r\n    other Power, without cause or reason, shows animosity towards this\r\n    Government, the matter is left in the hands of God, and to His\r\n    will. The esteemed Nawab Gholam Hussein Khan, the bearer of this\r\n    despatch, has, in accordance with written instructions received\r\n    from the British Government, asked for permission to retire, and\r\n    it has been granted.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: 25th October.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n1878\r\n\r\n  Shortcomings of my column--Attitude of the Border tribes\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a proud, albeit a most anxious, moment for me when I assumed\r\ncommand of the Kuram Field Force; though a local Major-General, I was\r\nonly a Major in my regiment, and save for a short experience on one\r\noccasion in Lushai, I had never had an opportunity of commanding\r\ntroops in the field. Earnestly longing for success, I was intensely\r\ninterested in ascertaining the qualities of those who were to aid me\r\nin achieving it. To this end I lost no time in taking stock of the\r\nseveral officers and corps who were to be associated with me, some of\r\nwhom were personally known to me, while others I had never met before;\r\nand in endeavouring to satisfy myself as to their qualifications and\r\nfitness for their several posts, I could not help feeling that they\r\nmust be equally anxious as to my capability for command, and that the\r\ninspection must be of nearly as great moment to them as to me.\r\n\r\nThe results of a very close investigation were tolerably satisfactory,\r\nbut there were weak points in my armour which gave me grave cause for\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nI came to the conclusion that the force was not numerically strong\r\nenough for the very difficult task before it--in the first instance,\r\nthe occupation of the Kuram valley and the expulsion of all Afghan\r\ngarrisons south of the Shutargardan Pass, and in the second, as\r\nopportunity might offer, the pushing my reconnaissances into the Khost\r\nvalley, and, if military considerations would admit, the dislodging\r\nthe Amir's administration from that tract of country, so as to prevent\r\nthe Kabul Government drawing supplies from it. Finally, I was directed\r\nto explore the roads leading to the unknown region beyond Khost.\r\n\r\nThe Shutargardan was not less than 180 miles from Kohat, the garrison\r\nof which station would, on my departure, be reduced to a minimum, and\r\nRawal Pindi, the nearest place from which aid could be procured, was\r\n130 miles still further off, separated from Kohat by an execrable road\r\nand the swiftly-flowing river Indus, crossed by a precarious bridge of\r\nboats. It had to be taken into account also that the various Afridi\r\ntribes were watching their opportunity, and at the first favourable\r\nmoment, in common with the tribesmen nearer Kuram, they might be\r\nexpected to take advantage of our weakness and attack our convoys and\r\nthe small posts which had necessarily to be established along our line\r\nof communication.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Mahomedan sepoys, of whom there were large numbers\r\nin four out of my six Native Infantry regiments, was also a cause of\r\nconsiderable anxiety; for I was aware that they were not altogether\r\nhappy at the prospect of taking part in a war against their\r\nco-religionist, the Ruler of Afghanistan, and that the mullas were\r\nalready urging them to desert our cause.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I discovered that my only British Infantry Regiment, the\r\n2nd Battalion of the 8th Foot, was sickly to a degree, and therefore\r\nin an unserviceable condition. It was largely composed of quite\r\nyoung, unacclimatized soldiers, peculiarly susceptible to fever--that\r\nterrible scourge which fills the hospitals of our Punjab stations in\r\nthe autumn of each year. I rode out to meet the battalion on its way\r\ninto Kohat, and was horrified to see the long line of doolies and\r\nambulance-carts by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nThe inefficient state of the transport added to my anxieties.\r\nNotwithstanding the difficulties experienced in former campaigns from\r\nthe same cause, the Government had neglected to take any steps for the\r\norganization of a proper transport service while we were at peace;\r\nconsequently, when everything should have been ready for a start,\r\nconfusion reigned supreme in this all-important department. Large\r\nnumbers of camels, mules, and bullocks arrived daily, picked up at\r\nexorbitant prices from anyone who would supply them; but most of these\r\nanimals were quite unfit to enter upon the hard work of a campaign,\r\nand with a totally inexperienced and quite insufficient staff of\r\nofficers to supervise them, it was evident that the majority must\r\nsuccumb at an early date.\r\n\r\nHardly had I realized these shortcomings in the constitution and\r\nequipment of my column than I received intelligence which led me to\r\nbelieve that the Afghans would hold the Peiwar Kotal (the pass leading\r\ninto Afghanistan over the range of mountains bounding the Kuram\r\nvalley) in great strength, and were determined to oppose our advance\r\nat this point. Under these circumstances I felt myself justified in\r\nrepresenting to the powers at Simla that I considered the number of\r\ntroops at my disposal inadequate for the task they were expected to\r\nperform, which representation resulted in the 23rd Pioneers, whose\r\ntransfer to the Khyber column had been under consideration, being left\r\nwith me, and the 72nd Highlanders, a battery of Field Artillery, and\r\nthe 28th Punjab Infantry, being sent to Kohat. Of these, however, I\r\nwas allowed to take on with me only one wing of the 72nd, half the\r\nbattery, and the 28th Punjab Infantry; and the last-named regiment I\r\ncould hardly consider as part of my force, for when we should arrive\r\nat Thal, our furthest frontier post, it would have to be dropped,\r\nwith a wing of the 5th Punjab Cavalry and No. 2 Mountain Battery, to\r\ngarrison that place.\r\n\r\nThis small reinforcement was not given to me without considerable\r\ndemur on the part of the military authorities, who had made up\r\ntheir minds that the Kuram column would meet with slight, if any,\r\nopposition, and that the chief stand would be made in the Khyber. Lord\r\nLytton, however, supported my appeal, as did Sir Neville Chamberlain,\r\nwho was then acting as Military Member of Council, and who had\r\npersonal knowledge of the great natural strength of the Peiwar Kotal\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nI next turned my attention to the transport, and endeavoured by all\r\nthe means I could think of to render it more efficient. A certain\r\nportion of it I placed in regimental charge; I had the men instructed\r\nin loading and unloading, and I took great care that the animals were\r\nnot overladen.\r\n\r\nHappily, I had a very able staff. Major Galbraith, the\r\nAssistant-Adjutant-General, though new to the work, proved\r\nexceptionally good, and Captain Badcock, the chief Commissariat\r\nofficer, and Major Collett and Captain 'Dick' Kennedy, officers of\r\nthe Quartermaster-General's department, whom I had myself selected, I\r\ncould thoroughly depend upon.\r\n\r\nAs regards my own personal staff I was equally lucky, Captain Pretyman\r\nof the R.A. being my A.D.C., and Lieutenant Neville Chamberlain, of\r\nthe Central India Horse, and Lieutenant-Colonel George Villiers, of\r\nthe Grenadier Guards, my Orderly officers.\r\n\r\nAs political adviser I had with me an old friend and schoolfellow,\r\nColonel Garrow Waterfield, Commissioner of Peshawar, who brought with\r\nhim a large following of Native gentlemen connected with the frontier,\r\nby whom he thought our intercourse with the tribesmen would be\r\nassisted. With scarcely an exception they proved loyal, and throughout\r\nthe campaign helped me materially.\r\n\r\nKnowing how important it was to secure the interest of the Chiefs and\r\nKhans of the border on our side, especially those who had influence in\r\nthe Kuram valley, we lost no opportunity of becoming acquainted with\r\nthem while we were at Kohat. They were friendly and full of promises,\r\nbut it was clear that the amount of assistance to be given by\r\nthem depended on whether or not our occupation of Kuram was to\r\nbe permanent, and on this important point I solicited definite\r\ninstructions. I reported to the Commander-in-Chief that, from all I\r\nhad learnt, the advent of a British force would be welcomed by the\r\npeople, provided they understood that it was the forerunner of\r\nannexation; that in this case we should be regarded as deliverers, and\r\nall the resources of the country would be placed at our disposal; but\r\nif the people were led to believe that the force would be withdrawn\r\nwhen our work was finished, and that they would be again handed over\r\nto the tender mercies of the Kabul Government, we must expect no aid\r\nfrom them, as they would naturally dread the resentment of their\r\nAfghan rulers.\r\n\r\nIn reply, I was informed that I could assure the people of Kuram that\r\nour occupation would be permanent; and my being enabled to make this\r\npromise was undoubtedly the explanation of the friendly reception we\r\nmet with on entering the valley, and the cause of my receiving at the\r\nsame time a letter from the Chief of the Turis (the inhabitants of\r\nthe Kuram valley), inquiring when we might be expected, as they were\r\nsuffering greatly from the tyranny of the Afghan Government, and were\r\nanxiously waiting the arrival of the British.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n1878\r\n\r\n  The Kuram valley--Conflicting news of the enemy\r\n  --An apparently impregnable position--Spingawi route decided on\r\n  --Disposition of the force--A night attack\r\n  --Advantages of a night attack--Devotion of my orderlies\r\n  --Threatening the enemy's rear--The Peiwar Kotal\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the 15th November my column[1] (consisting of 1,345 British and\r\n3,990 Native soldiers, with 13 guns) was concentrated at Thal, and on\r\nthe 20th--the limit of time given to the Amir--no reply having been\r\nvouchsafed to the Viceroy's ultimatum, orders were issued to the three\r\ncolumns to advance the next day.[2]\r\n\r\nThe Kuram valley, from which my force received its designation, is\r\nabout 60 miles long, and from 3 to 10 miles wide. On every side rise\r\nhigh and magnificently-wooded mountains, those on the north and east\r\nbeing the most lofty and precipitous, while on the north-west projects\r\nthe spur which runs down from Sika Bam, the highest peak of the Sufed\r\nKoh range, upwards of 14,000 feet high. This spur forms the boundary\r\nbetween Kuram and Afghanistan, and is crossed by the Peiwar Kotal. A\r\nriver, which varies from 100 to 500 yards in width, flows through the\r\nvalley, and the road, or, rather, track, which existed in 1878, ran\r\nfor the most part along its rocky bed. In the winter months the depth\r\nof the water nowhere exceeded three feet, except after heavy rain, and\r\nalthough the stream was rather swift, it could usually be forded\r\nwith very little risk. The valley itself had a bleak and deserted\r\nappearance, save in the immediate vicinity of the few and\r\nwidely-scattered villages, around which were clustered fruit trees and\r\npatches of cultivation.\r\n\r\nFor six weeks the thoughts of every one in the force had been turned\r\ntowards Kuram, consequently there was considerable excitement when at\r\n3 a.m. on the 21st November the leading troops crossed the river into\r\nAfghan territory and encamped eight miles from Thal. The next morning\r\nwe marched fifteen miles farther up the valley to Hazir Pir, where we\r\nhalted for one day to improve the road (in some places impracticable\r\nfor guns and transport) and to allow of the rear part of the column\r\nclosing up. As we proceeded on our way, the headmen from the different\r\nvillages came out to welcome us, and on arriving at Hazir Pir we found\r\na plentiful repast awaiting us spread under the shade of some trees.\r\nKnives and forks were evidently considered unnecessary adjuncts by our\r\nentertainers, so I unhesitatingly took my first lesson in eating roast\r\nkid and pillaued chicken without their aid.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th we marched to the Darwazai defile, and the next day\r\nproceeded through it to Kuram, forty-eight miles from Thal. We found\r\nthe fort evacuated by the Afghans, who had left behind one 6-pounder\r\ngun.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the proffers of assistance I had received, I could get\r\nno reliable information as to the whereabouts of the enemy; from one\r\naccount I was led to believe that they were in full retreat, from\r\nanother that they were being strongly reinforced. So, to find out the\r\ntruth, I reconnoitred as far as the cantonment of Habib Kila, fifteen\r\nmiles ahead, and there ascertained that the Afghan army, consisting\r\n(it was said) of 18,000 men and eleven guns, had left the place only\r\na short time before, and was then moving into position on the Peiwar\r\nKotal.\r\n\r\nDepot hospitals were formed at Kuram, and all our surplus stores and\r\nbaggage were left there with the following garrison: Two guns of F/A,\r\nRoyal Horse Artillery, half of G/3, R.A., the squadron 10th Hussars,\r\none squadron 12th Bengal Cavalry, and the company of Bengal Sappers\r\nand Miners, besides all the sick and weakly men of the column.\r\n\r\nAt 5 a.m. on the 28th the remainder of the force, with the exception\r\nof the troops who had been dropped at the several halting-places to\r\nkeep open our line of communication, marched towards the Peiwar.\r\n\r\nThe stars were still shining when we started, but it was very dark,\r\nand we were chilled to the bone by a breeze blowing straight off the\r\nsnows of the Sufed Koh; towards sunrise it died away, and was followed\r\nby oppressive heat and clouds of dust. Our progress was slow, for the\r\nbanks of the numerous nullas which intersect the valleys had to be\r\nramped before the guns and baggage could pass over them.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Habib Kila, intelligence was again brought that the Amir's\r\ntroops were in disorderly retreat, and had abandoned their guns at the\r\nfoot of the pass. I at once pushed a reconnaissance in force up the\r\nsouth-eastern slopes of the mountain under the command of Colonel\r\nGordon,[3] of the 29th Punjab Infantry, who discovered that, so far\r\nfrom the enemy having abandoned their guns, they had taken up an\r\nextremely strong position on the pass, from which they fired on the\r\nreconnaissance party as it advanced, wounding one British, one Native\r\nofficer[4] and nine men.\r\n\r\nAs the Afghans seemed inclined to press Gordon, two guns were brought\r\ninto action, and, to cover his retirement, I sent out the 5th Gurkhas,\r\nunder Lieutenant-Colonel Fitz-Hugh, who skilfully effected this object\r\nwith the loss of only one Gurkha wounded.\r\n\r\nGordon brought me back the valuable piece of information that no\r\nfurther advance in that direction was possible, save in single\r\nfile--valuable because, had I attempted a front attack, the sacrifice\r\nof life must have been enormous, even if the attack had proved\r\nsuccessful, the possibility of which I still greatly doubt.\r\n\r\nOur tents not having arrived, the force prepared to bivouac; but our\r\nposition proving untenable, from being within range of the Afghan\r\nshells, we moved a mile to the rear. Strong piquets were posted on\r\nthe neighbouring heights, and the night passed without further\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\nWe halted the two following days. Men and cattle were exhausted from\r\ntheir fatiguing marches, and supplies had to be brought up before\r\nwe could advance further; besides, I required time to look about\r\nme before making up my mind how the Peiwar Kotal could most\r\nadvantageously be attacked.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a formidable position--a great deal more formidable\r\nthan I had expected--on the summit of a mountain rising abruptly 2,000\r\nfeet above us, and only approachable by a narrow, steep, and rugged\r\npath, flanked on either side by precipitous spurs jutting out like\r\nhuge bastions, from which an overwhelming fire could be brought to\r\nbear on the assailants. The mountain on the enemy's right did not look\r\nmuch more promising for moving troops, and I could only hope that a\r\nway might be found on their left by which their flank could be turned.\r\nThe country, however, in that direction was screened from view by\r\nspurs covered with dense forests of deodar.\r\n\r\nI confess to a feeling very nearly akin to despair when I gazed at\r\nthe apparently impregnable position towering above us, occupied, as I\r\ncould discern through my telescope, by crowds of soldiers and a large\r\nnumber of guns.\r\n\r\nMy Chief Engineer, Colonel Perkins,[5] made a reconnaissance, which\r\nonly too surely confirmed Gordon's opinion; and he further ascertained\r\nthat a deep ravine lay between the ground occupied by our piquets on\r\nthe north and the kotal, so that an attack on the enemy's immediate\r\nleft seemed as hopeless as on his right, or to his front.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 29th I sent my Quartermaster-General, Major\r\nCollett, with his assistant, Captain Carr, and a small escort, to the\r\ntop of a hill, which lay to the right rear of our camp, from which\r\nthey were able to get a fairly good view of the surrounding country.\r\nCollett reported that, so far as he could judge, it seemed likely\r\nthat, as I had hoped, the enemy's left might be turned by a route over\r\nwhat was known as the Spingawi Kotal, where it had been ascertained\r\nthat some Afghan troops were posted. This was encouraging, but before\r\nI could finally decide on adopting this line of attack, it was\r\nexpedient to find out whether it was practicable for troops, and\r\nwhether the kotal itself was held in great strength. Accordingly,\r\nearly next morning, Collett was again despatched to make a closer\r\nreconnaissance of the Spingawi approaches.\r\n\r\nWhile all this was going on, I did everything I could think of to\r\nprevent what was in my mind being suspected by the enemy or, indeed,\r\nby my own troops. Each day more than once, accompanied by an imposing\r\nnumber of officers and a considerable escort, I climbed the lofty spur\r\nby which a direct attack would have to be covered, and everyone in\r\ncamp was made to believe that an attack in this direction was being\r\nprepared for. I was particularly careful to have this idea impressed\r\non the Turis and the Afghan camel-drivers, by whom the enemy were\r\npretty sure to be informed of what was going on; and also on the\r\nMahomedan sepoys, whom I suspected of being half-hearted. I confided\r\nmy real plan to only three people, my two senior staff-officers,\r\nGalbraith and Collett, and my A.D.C., Pretyman, for I knew, from the\r\nnature of the country, that, under the most favourable circumstances,\r\nthe way must be difficult and circuitous, and its passage must occupy\r\nseveral hours; and that if the Afghans got wind of the contemplated\r\nmovement, and should attack my small force while on the march and\r\ndivided, defeat if not annihilation would be inevitable, for the\r\nsurrounding tribes would be certain to join against us if once they\r\nbelieved us to be in difficulties.\r\n\r\nI had heard that the smallness of the column was being freely\r\ncommented on and discussed; indeed, people in Kuram did not care to\r\ndisguise their belief that we were hastening to our destruction. Even\r\nthe women taunted us. When they saw the little Gurkhas for the first\r\ntime, they exclaimed: 'Is it possible that these beardless boys think\r\nthey can fight Afghan warriors?' They little suspected that the brave\r\nspirits which animated those small forms made them more than a match\r\nfor the most stalwart Afghan. There was no hiding from ourselves,\r\nhowever, that the force was terribly inadequate for the work to be\r\ndone. But done it must be. A retirement was not to be thought of, and\r\ndelay would only add to our difficulties, as the Afghans were daily\r\nbeing reinforced from Kabul, and we heard of still further additions\r\nof both Artillery and Infantry being on their way.\r\n\r\nCollett returned soon after noon on the 30th; he had done admirably\r\nand brought me most useful information, the result of which was that\r\nI determined to adopt the Spingawi route. The nights were long, and I\r\ncalculated that by starting at 10 p.m., and allowing for unforeseen\r\ndelays, we should reach the foot of the pass while it was still dark.\r\n\r\nFresh efforts were now made to distract the enemy's attention from the\r\nreal point of attack. In addition to the reconnoitring parties which\r\nwere ostentatiously moved towards the Peiwar, batteries were marked\r\nout at points commanding the kotal, and a great display was made of\r\nthe arrival of the two Horse and three Field Artillery guns, which\r\nI had left at Kuram till the last moment on account of scarcity of\r\nforage at the front, and of the two squadrons of Bengal Cavalry, which\r\nfor the same reason I had sent back to Habib Kila. Even with these\r\nadditions the total strength of the force in camp, including British\r\nofficers, amounted to only 889 Europeans and 2,415 Natives, with 13\r\nguns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ATTACK ON THE PEIWAR KOTAL.\r\n_From a painting by Vereker Hamilton._]\r\n\r\nThese attempts to mislead the enemy were entirely successful, for\r\nthe Afghans shelled the working parties in the batteries, and placed\r\nadditional guns in position on the south side of the pass, showing\r\ndistinctly that they were preparing for a front attack, while in our\r\ncamp also it was generally believed that this was the movement which\r\nwould be carried out the next morning.\r\n\r\nWhen it became sufficiently dark to conceal our proceedings, all the\r\ncommanding and staff officers assembled in my tent, and I disclosed\r\nto them my scheme for the attack, impressing upon them that success\r\ndepended upon our being able to surprise the enemy, and begging of\r\nthem not even to whisper the word 'Spingawi' to each other.\r\n\r\nI had had sufficient time since I took over the command to test the\r\ncapabilities of the officers and regiments upon whom I had to depend,\r\nso that I had now no difficulty in disposing the troops in the manner\r\nmost likely to ensure success.\r\n\r\nFor the turning movement I selected:\r\n\r\n  4 guns F/A, R.H.A.,\r\n  The wing 72nd Highlanders,\r\n  No 1 Mountain Battery (4 guns),\r\n  2nd and 29th Punjab Infantry,\r\n  5th Gurkhas,\r\n  23rd Pioneers--\r\n  Total strength 2,263 men with 8 guns;\r\n\r\nand I determined to command the attack myself, with Brigadier-General\r\nThelwall as second in command.\r\n\r\nFor the feint and for the defence of our camp I left under the command\r\nof Brigadier-General Cobbe:\r\n\r\n  2 guns F/A, R.H.A.,\r\n  3 guns G/3, R.A.,\r\n  2nd Battalion 8th Foot,[6]\r\n  12th Bengal Cavalry,\r\n  5th Punjab Infantry.\r\n\r\nIn all, a little more than 1,000 men with 5 guns.\r\n\r\nAt 10 p.m. on Sunday, the 1st December, the little column fell in,\r\nin absolute silence, and began its hazardous march. Tents were left\r\nstanding and camp-fires burning; and so noiselessly were orders\r\ncarried out that our departure remained unsuspected even by those of\r\nour own people who were left in camp.\r\n\r\nThe track (for there was no road) led for two miles due east, and\r\nthen, turning sharp to the north, entered a wide gorge and ran along\r\nthe bed of a mountain stream. The moonlight lit up the cliffs on the\r\neastern side of the ravine, but made the darkness only the more dense\r\nin the shadow of the steep hills on the west, underneath which our\r\npath lay, over piles of stones and heaps of glacier débris. A bitterly\r\ncold wind rushed down the gorge, extremely trying to all, lightly clad\r\nas we were in anticipation of the climb before us. Onward and upwards\r\nwe slowly toiled, stumbling over great boulders of rock, dropping\r\ninto old water-channels, splashing through icy streams, and halting\r\nfrequently to allow the troops in the rear to close up.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the danger incurred, I was obliged every now and then to\r\nstrike a match and look at my watch to see how the time was going. I\r\nhad calculated that, by starting as early as ten o'clock, there would\r\nbe an hour or two to spare for rest. The distance, however, proved\r\nrather greater than was expected and the road much rougher, but these\r\nfacts were, to my mind, not sufficient to account for the slowness of\r\nour progress, and I proceeded to the head of the column, anxious to\r\ndiscover the true cause of the delay.\r\n\r\nI had chosen the 29th Punjab Infantry to lead the way, on account of\r\nthe high reputation of Colonel John Gordon, who commanded it, and\r\nbecause of the excellent character the regiment had always borne;\r\nbut on overtaking it my suspicions were excited by the unnecessarily\r\nstraggling manner in which the men were marching, and to which I\r\ncalled Gordon's attention. No sooner had I done so than a shot was\r\nfired from one of the Pathan companies, followed in a few seconds by\r\nanother. The Sikh companies of the regiment immediately closed up, and\r\nGordon's Sikh orderly whispered in his ear that there was treachery\r\namongst the Pathans.\r\n\r\nIt was a moment of intense anxiety, for it was impossible to tell how\r\nfar we were from the Spingawi Kotal, or whether the shots could be\r\nheard by the enemy; it was equally impossible to discover by whom the\r\nshots had been fired without delaying the advance, and this I was\r\nloath to risk. So, grieved though I was to take any steps likely to\r\ndiscredit a regiment with such admirable traditions, I decided to\r\nchange the order of the march by bringing one company of the\r\n72nd Highlanders and the 5th Gurkhas to the front, and I warned\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Brownlow, in command of the 72nd, to keep a watch\r\nover the Pathans with his three remaining companies, for I felt\r\nthat our enterprise had already been sufficiently imperilled by the\r\nPathans, and that hesitation would be culpable; for, unless we\r\ncould reach the kotal while our approach was still concealed by\r\nthe darkness, the turning movement would in all probability end in\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nOn the Gurkhas coming up, I told Major Fitz-Hugh, who commanded them,\r\nthat the moment he reached the foot of the kotal, he must front form\r\ncompany, fix bayonets, and charge up the slope without waiting for\r\nfurther orders.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards, and just as the first streak of dawn proclaimed the\r\napproach of day, the enemy became aware of our presence, and fired\r\ninto us, when instantly I heard Fitz-Hugh give the word to charge.\r\nBrownlow, at the head of his Highlanders, dashed forward in support,\r\nand two guns of the Mountain battery coming up at the moment, I\r\nordered its Commandant, Captain Kelso, to come into action as soon as\r\nhe could find a position.\r\n\r\nI was struck by the smile of satisfied pride and pleasure with\r\nwhich he received the order. He was delighted, no doubt, that the\r\nopportunity had arrived to prove what the battery--to perfect which he\r\nhad spared neither time nor labour--could do; but it was the last time\r\nthat gallant soldier smiled, for a few seconds later he was shot dead.\r\n\r\nThe Gurkhas, forgetting their fatigue, rapidly climbed the steep side\r\nof the mountain, and, swarming into the first entrenchment, quickly\r\ncleared it of the enemy; then, guided by the flashes of the Afghan\r\nrifles, they pressed on, and, being joined by the leading company of\r\nthe 72nd, took possession of a second and larger entrenchment 200\r\nyards higher up. Without a perceptible pause, the Highlanders and\r\nGurkhas together rushed a third position, the most important of all,\r\nas it commanded the head of the pass.\r\n\r\nThe Spingawi Kotal was won; but we were surrounded by woods, which\r\nwere crowded with Afghans, some 400 of whom made a dashing but\r\nineffectual attempt to carry off their guns, left behind in the first\r\nscare of our sudden attack. These men were dressed so exactly like\r\nsome of our own Native soldiers that they were not recognized until\r\nthey got within 100 yards of the entrenchment, and they would\r\ndoubtless have succeeded in accomplishing their purpose--as the\r\nHighlanders and Gurkhas were busy pursuing the fugitives--had not\r\nGalbraith, whom I had sent with an order to the front, hurriedly\r\ncollected a certain number of stragglers and met the Afghans with such\r\na murderous fire that they broke and fled, leaving seventy dead in a\r\nspace of about fifty yards square.\r\n\r\nAs the rising sun lighted up the scene of the conflict, the advantages\r\nof a night attack became more apparent. The pass lay across the\r\nshoulder of a mountain (9,400 feet above the sea), and through a\r\nmagnificent pine forest. Its approaches were commanded by precipitous\r\nheights, defended by breastworks of felled trees, which completely\r\nscreened the defenders, who were quite comfortably placed in wide\r\nditches, from which they could fire deadly volleys without being in\r\nthe least exposed themselves. Had we not been able to surprise the\r\nenemy before the day dawned, I doubt whether, any of us could have\r\nreached the first entrenchment. As it was, the regiment holding it\r\nfled in such a hurry that a sheepskin coat and from sixty to a hundred\r\nrounds of ammunition were left behind on the spot where each man had\r\nlain.\r\n\r\nWe had gained our object so far, but we were still a considerable\r\ndistance from the body of the Afghan army on the Peiwar Kotal.\r\n\r\nImmediately in rear of the last of the three positions on the Spingawi\r\nKotal was a _murg_, or open grassy plateau, upon which I re-formed the\r\ntroops who had carried the assault. The 2nd Punjab Infantry, the 23rd\r\nPioneers, and the battery of Royal Horse Artillery were still behind;\r\nbut as the guns were being transported on elephants, I knew the\r\nprogress of this part of the force must be slow, and thinking it\r\nunwise to allow the Afghans time to recover from their defeat, I\r\ndetermined to push on with the troops at hand.\r\n\r\nA field hospital was formed on the _murg_, and placed under a guard,\r\nammunition-pouches were re-filled, and off we started again, choosing\r\nas our route the left of two hog-backed, thickly-wooded heights\r\nrunning almost longitudinally in the direction of the Peiwar Kotal, in\r\nthe hope that from this route communication might be established with\r\nour camp below. I was not disappointed, for very soon Captain Wynne,\r\nin charge of the signalling, was able to inform Brigadier-General\r\nCobbe of our progress, and convey to him the order to co-operate with\r\nme so far as his very limited numbers would permit.\r\n\r\nOur advance was at first unopposed, but very slow, owing to the\r\ndensity of the forest, which prevented our seeing any distance, and\r\nmade it difficult to keep the troops together.\r\n\r\nAt the end of two hours we arrived at the edge of a deep hollow, on\r\nthe further side of which, 150 yards off, the enemy were strongly\r\nposted, and they at once opened fire upon us.\r\n\r\nFancy my dismay at this critical moment on discovering that the\r\nHighlanders, Gurkhas, and the Mountain battery, had not come up! They\r\nhad evidently taken a wrong turn in the almost impenetrable forest,\r\nand I found myself alone with the 29th Punjab Infantry. Knowing that\r\nthe missing troops could not be far off, I hoped that they would hear\r\nthe firing, which was each moment becoming heavier; but some time\r\npassed, and there were no signs of their approach. I sent staff\r\nofficer after staff officer to search for them, until one only\r\nremained, the Rev. J.W. Adams, who had begged to be allowed to\r\naccompany me as Aide-de-camp for this occasion, and him I also\r\ndespatched in quest of the missing troops. After some time, which\r\nseemed to me an age, he returned to report that no trace could he find\r\nof them; so again I started him off in another direction. Feeling\r\nthe situation was becoming serious, and expecting that the Afghans,\r\nencouraged by our inaction, would certainly attack us, I thought it\r\nadvisable to make a forward movement; but the attitude of the 29th\r\nwas not encouraging. I addressed them, and expressed a hope that they\r\nwould now by their behaviour wipe out the slur of disloyalty which\r\nthe firing of the signal shots had cast upon the regiment, upon which\r\nCaptain Channer,[7] who was just then in command, stepped forward, and\r\nsaid he would answer for the Sikhs; but amongst the Pathans there\r\nwas an ominous silence, and Channer agreed with me that they did not\r\nintend to fight. I therefore ordered Channer and his subaltern, Picot,\r\nto advance cautiously down the slope with the Sikhs of the regiment,\r\nfollowing myself near enough to keep the party in sight. I had not\r\ngone far, however, before I found that the enemy were much too\r\nstrongly placed to be attacked successfully by so few men; accordingly\r\nI recalled Channer, and we returned to the position at the top of the\r\nhill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MY GURKHA ORDERLIES.\r\n_From a water colour sketch by Colonel Woodthorpe, C.B., R.E._]\r\n\r\nMy orderlies[8] during this little episode displayed such touching\r\ndevotion that it is with feelings of the most profound admiration and\r\ngratitude I call to mind their self-sacrificing courage. On this (as\r\non many other occasions) they kept close round me, determined that no\r\nshot should reach me if they could prevent it; and on my being hit in\r\nthe hand by a spent bullet, and turning to look round in the direction\r\nit came from, I beheld one of the Sikhs standing with his arms\r\nstretched out trying to screen me from the enemy, which he could\r\neasily do, for he was a grand specimen of a man, a head and shoulders\r\ntaller than myself.\r\n\r\nTo my great relief, on my return to the edge of the hollow, Adams met\r\nme with the good tidings that he had found not only the lost troops,\r\nbut the Native Infantry of the rear portion of the column, and had\r\nascertained that the elephants with the guns were close at hand.\r\n\r\nTheir arrival was most opportune, for the enemy had been reinforced,\r\nand, having discovered our numerical weakness, were becoming bolder;\r\nthey charged down the hill, and were now trying to force their way\r\nup to our position, but our Mountain guns were quickly brought into\r\naction, and under their cover another attempt was made to drive the\r\nAfghans from their position. The 23rd Pioneers, under the command of\r\nColonel Currie, the two front companies led by Captain Anderson, moved\r\ndown the slope, and were soon lost to view in the thick wood at\r\nthe bottom of the dell; when they reappeared it was, to my great\r\ndisappointment, on the wrong side of the hollow: they had failed in\r\nthe attack, and Anderson and some men had been killed. The enemy's\r\nposition, it was found, could only be reached by a narrow causeway,\r\nwhich was swept by direct and cross fires, and obstructed by trunks of\r\ntrees and a series of barricades.\r\n\r\nIt was evident to me that under these circumstances the enemy could\r\nnot be cleared out of their entrenchment by direct attack without\r\nentailing heavy loss, which I could ill afford and was most anxious to\r\navoid. I therefore reconnoitred both flanks to find, if possible, a\r\nway round the hill. On our left front was a sheer precipice; on the\r\nright, however, I discovered, to my infinite satisfaction, that we\r\ncould not only avoid the hill which had defeated us, but could get\r\nalmost in rear of the Peiwar Kotal itself, and threaten the enemy's\r\nretreat from that position.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture I was further cheered by the arrival of\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Perkins and Major McQueen, who, with the 5th Punjab\r\nInfantry, had worked their way up the steep mountain-side, in the hope\r\nof getting near to the Peiwar Kotal and co-operating with me. They\r\nwere, however, checked by the deep ravine I have before described,\r\nand, guided by the sound of firing, pushed higher up the hill. They\r\nbrought me word that the Artillery left in camp had opened fire on the\r\nkotal soon after daybreak, and had succeeded in silencing two of the\r\nenemy's guns; that our Infantry had crept up within 1,400 yards of the\r\nkotal, but were met by such a destructive fire that they could not\r\nadvance further; that Brigadier-General Cobbe had been severely\r\nwounded, and that Colonel Barry Drew had assumed the command. Perkins\r\nalso gave me the useful information that he had observed on his way up\r\na spur from which the kotal position could be fired upon at a distance\r\nof 1,100 yards. To this spot I ordered Lieutenant Sherries, who had\r\nsucceeded poor Kelso in command of the Mountain battery, to take his\r\nguns, and I asked Perkins to return and tell Drew to press on to the\r\nkotal, in the hope that Sherries's fire and the turning movement I was\r\nabout, to make would cause the enemy to retreat.\r\n\r\nI sent the 29th Punjab Infantry back to the Spingawi to protect the\r\nwounded. I left the 2nd Punjab Infantry in the position we had up till\r\nnow been occupying, and I took McQueen's regiment with me.\r\n\r\nA few rounds from the Mountain battery, and the fact that their rear\r\nwas threatened and their retreat about to be cut off, soon produced\r\nsigns of wavering amongst the Afghans. Their Artillery fire slackened,\r\ntheir Infantry broke, and about 2 p.m. Drew and Hugh Gough found it\r\npossible to make a move towards the Peiwar Kotal. Gough was the first\r\nto reach the crest, closely followed by Lieutenant Brabazon, his\r\norderly officer, and a fine plucky Dogra named Birbul. They were soon\r\njoined by some hundreds of Turi levies collected by Waterfield and by\r\nthe 8th Foot. Another body of levies under Major Palmer,[9] who\r\nhad done good service by making a feint on the right of the Afghan\r\nposition, arrived about the same time. Plunder was of course the sole\r\nobject of the Turis, but their co-operation at the moment was useful,\r\nand helped to swell our small numbers. The enemy having evacuated\r\ntheir stronghold and retreated by the Alikhel road, abandoning in\r\ntheir headlong flight guns, waggons, and baggage, were pursued by Hugh\r\nGough, whose Cavalry had by this time come up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MY SIKH ORDERLIES.\r\n_From a water colour sketch by Colonel Woodthorpe, C.B., R.E._]\r\n\r\nThe Peiwar Kotal was not visible from the route we had taken, but just\r\nbefore daylight had quite gone I could make out with the aid of my\r\ntelescope a large body of Afghans moving towards the Shutargardan,\r\nwhich made me feel quite satisfied that the enemy's position was in\r\nour possession.\r\n\r\nNight overtook us before we could reach the kotal, and as everyone was\r\nthoroughly tired out, having been hard at work since 10 p.m. the night\r\nbefore, with but little food, I thought it better to bivouac where we\r\nwere, on the southern slope of the Sika Ram mountain. It was hardly\r\na pleasant experience lying on the ground without even cloaks at an\r\nelevation of 9,000 feet, and with the thermometer marking twenty\r\ndegrees of frost; but spite of cold and hunger, thoroughly content\r\nwith the day's work, and with my mind at rest, I slept as soundly as I\r\nhad ever done in the most luxurious quarters, and I think others did\r\nthe same. At any rate, no one that I could hear of suffered from that\r\nnight's exposure.\r\n\r\nWe continued our march at daybreak, and reached the kotal in an hour.\r\n\r\nThe examination of the enemy's position was very interesting. It was\r\nof enormous natural strength, the dispositions made for its defence\r\nwere most complete and judicious, and the impossibility of taking\r\nit by other than a turning movement was proved beyond a doubt; it\r\nextended from the Spingawi to some commanding heights nearly a mile\r\nsouth of the Peiwar Kotal; thus having a front of about four miles\r\nfacing due east. From right to left the position ran along a lofty and\r\nrugged range of mountains, clothed with dense pine-forests. Towards\r\nthe eastern side the range was precipitous, but descended on the west\r\nby a succession of upland meadows to the valley of the Hariab; it was\r\ncrossed by only two roads, viz., the Peiwar and Spingawi Kotals; at a\r\nfew other points there were paths, but too narrow and precipitous for\r\nthe passage of troops.\r\n\r\nThe Peiwar Kotal is a narrow depression in the ridge, commanded on\r\neach side by high pine-clad mountains. The approach to it from the\r\nKuram valley was up a steep, narrow, zigzag path, commanded throughout\r\nits entire length from the adjacent heights, and difficult to ascend\r\non account of the extreme roughness of the road, which was covered\r\nwith large fragments of rocks and boulders. Every point of the ascent\r\nwas exposed to fire from both guns and rifles, securely placed behind\r\nbreastworks constructed of pine-logs and stones. At the top of\r\nthe path was a narrow plateau, which was again commanded from the\r\nthickly-wooded heights on each side, rising to an elevation of 500\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe Afghan Commander had been quite confident of success, and was\r\nonly waiting for reinforcements to attack our camp; but these\r\nreinforcements did not arrive until the afternoon of the 1st December,\r\njust too late for him to carry out his intention. He had under his\r\ncommand eight Regular regiments of the Afghan army, and eighteen\r\nguns; while these numbers were augmented by hordes of neighbouring\r\ntribesmen, who were only too glad to respond to the cry of a _jahad_\r\nagainst the infidel, firmly believing that as true believers their\r\ncause would be victorious.\r\n\r\nOur loss at the Peiwar was not great--2 officers and 18 men killed,\r\nand 3 officers and 75 men wounded. The Afghans suffered much more\r\nseverely, besides leaving in our possession all their guns, with\r\nquantities of ammunition and other warlike stores.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The details of the column are given in the Appendix.\r\n(Appendix III.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: On the 30th November a subordinate officer of the Kabul\r\nGovernment reached Sir Samuel Browne's camp at Daka, and delivered the\r\nfollowing letter from the Amir to the address of the Viceroy:\r\n\r\n    'FROM HIS HIGHNESS THE AMIR OF KABUL TO THE VICEROY OF INDIA.\r\n    'KABUL, _19th November, 1878_.\r\n\r\n    'Be it known to your Excellency that I have received, and read\r\n    from beginning to end, the friendly letter which your Excellency\r\n    has sent, in reply to the letter I despatched by Nawab Ghulam\r\n    Hussein Khan. With regard to the expressions used by your\r\n    Excellency in the beginning of your letter, referring to the\r\n    friendly character of the Mission and the goodwill of the British\r\n    Government, I leave it to your Excellency, whose wisdom and\r\n    justice are universally admitted, to decide whether any reliance\r\n    can be placed upon goodwill, if it be evidenced by words only.\r\n    But if, on the other hand, goodwill really consists of deeds and\r\n    actions, then it has not been manifested by the various wishes\r\n    that have been expressed, and the proposals that have been made by\r\n    British officials during the last few years to officials of this\r\n    God-granted Government--proposals which, from their nature, it was\r\n    impossible for them to comply with.\r\n\r\n    'One of these proposals referred to my dutiful son, the\r\n    ill-starred wretch, Mahomed Yakub Khan, and was contained in a\r\n    letter addressed by the officials of the British Government to\r\n    the British Agent then residing in Kabul. It was written in that\r\n    letter that, \"if the said Yakub Khan be released and set at\r\n    liberty, our friendship with the Afghan Government will be firmly\r\n    cemented, but that otherwise it will not.\"\r\n\r\n    'There are several other grounds of complaint of similar nature,\r\n    which contain no evidence of goodwill, but which, on the contrary,\r\n    were effective in increasing the aversion and apprehension already\r\n    entertained by the subjects of this God-granted Government.\r\n\r\n    'With regard to my refusal to receive the British Mission, your\r\n    Excellency has stated that it would appear from my conduct that I\r\n    was actuated by feelings of direct hostility towards the British\r\n    Government.\r\n\r\n    'I assure your Excellency that, on the contrary, the officials of\r\n    this God-granted Government, in repulsing the Mission, were not\r\n    influenced by any hostile or inimical feelings towards the British\r\n    Government, nor did they intend that any insult or affront should\r\n    be offered. But they were afraid that the independence of this\r\n    Government might be affected by the arrival of the Mission,\r\n    and that the friendship which has now existed between the two\r\n    Governments for several years might be annihilated.\r\n\r\n    'A paragraph in your Excellency's letter corroborates the\r\n    statement which they have made to this Government. The feelings\r\n    of apprehension which were aroused in the minds of the people of\r\n    Afghanistan by the mere announcement of the intention of the\r\n    British Government to send a Mission to Kabul, before the\r\n    Mission itself had actually started or arrived at Peshawar, have\r\n    subsequently been fully justified by the statement in your\r\n    Excellency's letter, that I should be held responsible for any\r\n    injury that might befall the tribes who acted as guides to the\r\n    Mission, and that I should be called upon to pay compensation to\r\n    them for any loss they might have suffered; and that if, at any\r\n    time, these tribes should meet with ill-treatment at my hands, the\r\n    British Government would at once take steps to protect them.\r\n\r\n    'Had these apprehensions proved groundless, and had the object\r\n    of the Mission been really friendly, and no force or threats of\r\n    violence used, the Mission would, as a matter of course, have been\r\n    allowed a free passage, as such Missions are customary and of\r\n    frequent occurrence between allied States. I am now sincerely\r\n    stating my own feelings when I say that this Government has\r\n    maintained, and always will maintain, the former friendship which\r\n    existed between the two Governments, and cherishes no feelings of\r\n    hostility and opposition towards the British Government.\r\n\r\n    'It is also incumbent upon the officials of the British Government\r\n    that, out of respect and consideration for the greatness and\r\n    eminence of their own Government, they should not consent to\r\n    inflict any injury upon their well-disposed neighbours, and to\r\n    impose the burden of grievous troubles upon the shoulders of\r\n    their sincere friends. But, on the contrary, they should exert\r\n    themselves to maintain the friendly feelings which have hitherto\r\n    existed towards this God-granted Government, in order that the\r\n    relations between the two Governments may remain on the same\r\n    footing as before; and if, in accordance with the custom of allied\r\n    States, the British Government should desire to send a purely\r\n    friendly and temporary Mission to this country, with a small\r\n    escort, not exceeding twenty or thirty men, similar to that which\r\n    attended the Russian Mission, this servant of God will not oppose\r\n    its progress.'\r\n\r\nIt was ascertained that this messenger had come to Basawal on the\r\n22nd November, when, hearing of the capture of Ali Masjid by British\r\ntroops, he immediately returned to Kabul. The Amir's letter, though\r\ndated the 19th November, was believed to have been re-written at Kabul\r\nafter the news of the fall of Ali Masjid. The text of this letter was\r\ntelegraphed to the Secretary of State on the 7th December; in reply\r\nLord Cranbrook pointed out that the letter evaded all the requirements\r\nspecified in the Viceroy's ultimatum, and could not have been accepted\r\neven if it had reached him before the 20th November.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Now General J.

The Sikhs and Gurkhas never left me for a\r\nday during the two years I was in Afghanistan. The Pathans behaved\r\nequally well, but they fell sick, and had to be changed more than\r\nonce. Whenever I emerged from my tent, two or more of the orderlies\r\nappeared and kept close by me. They had always good information as to\r\nwhat was going on, and I could generally tell whether there was likely\r\nto be trouble or not by the number in attendance; they put themselves\r\non duty, and decided how many were required. One of the Gurkhas is\r\nsince dead, but the other and the two Sikhs served with me afterwards\r\nin Burma, and all three now hold the high position of Subadar in their\r\nrespective regiments.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Now Major-General Sir Arthur Palmer, K.C.B.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n1878-1879\r\n\r\n  Alikhel--Treachery of the tribesmen--Transport difficulties\r\n  --Sher Ali looks to Russia for aid--Khost--An attack on our camp\r\n  --An unsuccessful experiment--An unpleasant incident\r\n  --Punjab Chiefs' Contingent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPerceiving that further pursuit of the enemy would be useless, I\r\ndecided to halt a few days to admit of our overtaxed transport\r\nbringing up supplies and tents, and to arrange for the occupation of\r\nthe Peiwar position during the winter months. But I considered that my\r\nwork would be incomplete if we stopped short of the Shutargardan Pass.\r\nMoreover, it was very desirable that we should investigate this route,\r\nand, if possible, get into friendly communication with some of the\r\nsections of the Ghilzai tribe. The Jajis, through whose territory\r\nthe first part of the road ran, now showed themselves to be as\r\nwell disposed as the Turis; they readily brought in supplies, and\r\nvolunteered to labour for us, and from the information obtained by\r\nthe political officers, the inhabitants of the Hariab valley seemed\r\nequally anxious to be friendly. The dislodgment of the Afghan army by\r\na much smaller force, from a position they had themselves chosen, had\r\nevidently had a salutary effect.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I had leisure, I inquired from Colonel Gordon whether he\r\nhad been able to discover the men who had fired the signal shots on\r\nthe night of the 2nd, and whether he did not think that the Pathan\r\nNative officers ought to be able to point out the offenders. Gordon\r\nreplied that he suspected the Jemadar of the Pathan company knew who\r\nthe culprits were, and that one soldier had confessed to firing the\r\nsecond shot; moreover, he told me that eighteen Pathans had left the\r\nregiment during the fight. On receiving this unpleasant information,\r\nI assembled a Court of Inquiry, with orders to have the proceedings\r\nready for my consideration by the time I returned from the\r\nShutargardan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF MY PATHAN ORDERLIES.\r\n_From a water-colour sketch by Colonel Woodthorpe, C.B., R.E._]\r\n\r\nHaving despatched the sick and wounded to Kuram and made all necessary\r\narrangements, I marched on the 6th December to Alikhel, twelve miles\r\non the road to the Shutargardan. Before starting, I issued an order\r\nthanking the troops for the efforts they had made to ensure success,\r\nand I had the honour of communicating to them at the same time a\r\ncongratulatory message from the Queen.[1]\r\n\r\nWe reached the foot of the Shutargardan on the 8th, and reconnoitred\r\nto the top of the pass the next morning. This point was 11,000 feet\r\nabove the sea, commanded a fine view of the Logar valley, and I\r\ndiscovered from it that there was nothing between us and the immediate\r\nvicinity of Kabul to prevent a force moving rapidly on that place.\r\n\r\nWe returned to Alikhel on the 10th, and, as it was important to retain\r\ncontrol of this advanced post, I decided to leave Captain Rennick in\r\npolitical charge, a duty for which his nerve and determination of\r\ncharacter eminently fitted him. Colonel Waterfield, as a temporary\r\narrangement, remained there also with a battery of Artillery and two\r\nregiments of Punjab Infantry, for the purpose of establishing friendly\r\nrelations with the neighbouring tribesmen.\r\n\r\nFrom Alikhel there were said to be two roads leading to Kuram, besides\r\nthe difficult path over the Peiwar Kotal; and as it was of\r\ngreat importance to gain a knowledge of an alternative line of\r\ncommunication, in view of further trouble, I determined to explore one\r\nof them, choosing that which appeared to be the shortest, and which I\r\nheard had been used some time before by an Afghan Mountain battery.\r\nThis route was described as practicable for camels, and ran through\r\nlands belonging to tribes whose headmen were with me, a fact which\r\nshould, I thought, ensure our being free from attack.\r\n\r\nI left Alikhel on the 12th December, taking with me No. 1 Mountain\r\nBattery, a wing 72nd Highlanders, the 5th Gurkhas, and the 23rd\r\nPioneers. The route lay for four miles along the banks of the Hariab\r\nstream, a tributary of the Kuram river, through a valley which\r\ngradually narrowed into a thickly-wooded ravine, three miles long: at\r\nthe end of this ravine the road, turning sharply to the left, ascended\r\ntill it reached an open grassy plateau, on which stood the hamlet of\r\nSapari. The inhabitants turned out to welcome us, bringing supplies,\r\nand appearing so friendly that I settled to halt there for the night.\r\nI had been warned, however, by the _maliks_ of some of the villages we\r\nhad passed through in the morning, that we should probably be attacked\r\non the march the next day, and that a defile which lay at the other\r\nside of a mountain over which we had to cross would be particularly\r\ndangerous to us. I determined, therefore, to send on troops that\r\nevening to occupy the pass over this mountain, and to start the\r\nbaggage off long before daybreak, so that it should be out of the way\r\nof the main body, which would also have to march at an early hour in\r\norder to reach the kotal before the tribesmen had time to collect.\r\n\r\nThis could have been accomplished without difficulty, but for the\r\nmachinations of our false friends in the village, who directed on to\r\nthe precipitous path we had to ascend a stream of water which soon\r\nturned into a sheet of ice, and when I arrived on the spot I found\r\nthe road blocked by fallen animals vainly struggling to regain their\r\nfooting. This caused so much delay that it was nearly noon before the\r\nlast camel had got over the pass.\r\n\r\nThe descent on the other side was scarcely less difficult, though free\r\nfrom ice. We dropped 3,000 feet in the first two miles, down a way\r\nwhich can only be described as a ruined staircase, with the steps\r\nmissing at intervals, ending in the defile against the dangers of\r\nwhich we had been warned. This defile was certainly a nasty place to\r\nbe caught in, being five miles long, and so narrow that the camels'\r\nloads struck against the rocks on either side; and it was impossible\r\nto move flanking parties along the cliffs above, as they were\r\nintersected by wide chasms running back for long distances.\r\n\r\nIt was important to secure the exit from this gorge without delay, and\r\nfor this purpose I pushed on four companies of the 23rd Pioneers, and\r\nin support, when the ravine began to widen out a little, I hurried\r\non the Highlanders and the Mountain battery, leaving the Gurkhas to\r\nprotect the baggage and bring up the rear.\r\n\r\nWe only got possession of the exit just in time. The Pioneers,\r\nby occupying commanding positions on either side of the opening,\r\neffectually checkmated several large bodies of armed men who were\r\napproaching from different directions, and whose leaders now declared\r\nthey had only come to help us! Later on we discovered still more\r\nformidable gatherings, which doubtless would have all combined to\r\nattack us, had they been in time to catch us in the ravine.\r\n\r\nThe tail of the column was followed and much harassed by the enemy;\r\nbut they were kept at bay by the steadiness of the gallant Gurkhas,\r\nand so successful were they in safe-guarding the baggage, that,\r\nalthough many of the drivers ran away at the first shot, leaving the\r\nsoldiers to lead the animals as well as defend them, not a single\r\narticle fell into the hands of the tribesmen. The regiment lost three\r\nmen killed, and Captain Powell and eleven men wounded. Captain Goad,\r\nof the Transport Department, was also badly hurt.[2]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF MY PATHAN ORDERLIES.\r\n_From a water-colour sketch by Colonel Woodthorpe, C.B., R.E._]\r\n\r\nOn Goad being knocked over, Sergeant Greer, of the 72nd Highlanders,\r\nassisted by three privates, picked him up, and having placed him under\r\ncover of a rock, they turned their attention to the enemy. They were\r\nonly four against large numbers, but by their cool and steady use of\r\nthe Martini-Henry rifle, which had shortly before been issued to the\r\nBritish soldiers in India, they were enabled to hold their ground\r\nuntil help arrived, when they succeeded in carrying the wounded\r\nofficer away.\r\n\r\nI had observed in the advance on the Peiwar Kotal the skill and\r\ngallantry displayed by Sergeant Greer, and noted him as a man fitted\r\nfor promotion. His distinguished conduct in rescuing and defending\r\nGoad confirmed me in my opinion, and I accordingly recommended him\r\nfor a commission, which, to my great gratification, Her Majesty was\r\ngraciously pleased to bestow upon him.\r\n\r\nThat night we halted at the village of Keria; thence the route was\r\neasy enough, so, leaving the troops to rest and recover from the last\r\nhard march, I rode on to Kuram, where there was much to be done.\r\n\r\nThe ejectment of the Afghan ruler of Khost and the exploration of that\r\nvalley formed, it will be remembered, part of the programme given\r\nto me to carry through, and it was very desirable that this service\r\nshould be completed before the winter rains set in. Peace and order\r\nnow reigned in Upper Kuram and in the neighbourhood of the Peiwar; but\r\nthere was a good deal of excitement in the lower part of the valley\r\nand in Khost, our line of communication was constantly harassed by\r\nraiders, convoys were continually threatened, outposts fired into, and\r\ntelegraph-wires cut. The smallness of my force made it difficult for\r\nme to deal with these troubles, so I applied to the Commander-in-Chief\r\nfor the wing of the 72nd Highlanders left at Kohat, and the 5th Punjab\r\nCavalry at Thal to be ordered to join me at Kuram. At the same time I\r\nmoved up No. 2 Mountain Battery and the 28th Punjab Infantry, sending\r\nthe 29th Punjab Infantry to take the place of the 28th at Thal.\r\n\r\nI was greatly hampered by want of transport. Arrangements had to be\r\nmade for sending the sick and wounded, as well as the captured guns,\r\nto Kohat (the sight of the latter, I fancied, would have a good effect\r\non the tribes in our rear); but hard work, scarcity of forage, and\r\nabsence of supervision, had told, as was to be expected, on animals in\r\nbad condition at the outset. Mules and camels died daily, reducing our\r\nall too small numbers to such an extent that it was with considerable\r\ndifficulty the convoy was at last despatched.\r\n\r\nFrom the first I foresaw that want of transport would be our greatest\r\ndifficulty, and so it proved; very few supplies could be obtained in\r\nthe vicinity of Kuram; the troops at Kohat had been drawing on the\r\nadjacent districts ever since October, so that the purchasing\r\nagents had every day to go further away to procure necessaries, and\r\nconsequently an increased number of animals were required for their\r\nconveyance. My Commissary-General reported to me that only a few days'\r\nprovisions for the troops remained in hand, and that it was impossible\r\nto lay in any reserve unless more transport could be provided. About\r\nthis reserve I was very anxious, for the roads might soon become\r\ntemporarily impassable from the rising of the rivers after the heavy\r\nrain to be expected about Christmas. Contractors were despatched\r\nto all parts of the country to procure camels, and I suggested to\r\nGovernment that pack-bullocks should be bought at Mirzapur, and railed\r\nup country, which suggestion being acted upon, the danger of the\r\ntroops having to go hungry was warded off.\r\n\r\nThe treacherous soldiers of the 29th Punjab Infantry had now to be\r\ndealt with--a necessary, but most unpleasant, duty. A perusal of the\r\nproceedings of the Court of Inquiry satisfied me that the two men who\r\ndischarged their rifles during the night-march, the Jemadar of their\r\ncompany who failed to report their criminal action, and the eighteen\r\nwho deserted their colours during the engagement, should all be tried\r\nby Court-Martial.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were found guilty. The sepoy who fired the first shot\r\nwas sentenced to death, and the one who discharged the second to\r\ntwo years' imprisonment with hard labour; the court, recognizing a\r\npossibility that the latter, being a young soldier, might have loaded\r\nand fired without intending treachery, gave him the benefit of the\r\ndoubt. The Jemadar was awarded seven years' transportation, and the\r\neighteen deserters terms varying from ten years to one year.\r\n\r\nIt was with deep regret that I confirmed these several sentences, but\r\nit was necessary that a deterrent example should be made. Treachery\r\nwas altogether too grave a crime to be lightly dealt with, and\r\ndesertions amongst the Pathans were becoming of much too frequent\r\noccurrence, particularly as the deserters invariably carried away with\r\nthem their rifles and ammunition.\r\n\r\nThe effect of these sentences was most salutary; there was not a\r\nsingle desertion subsequent to the Court-Martial for more than a year,\r\nalthough during that time the Mahomedan portion of my force were\r\nseverely tried by appeals from their co-religionists.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Eve authentic intelligence was brought to me that, on\r\nhearing of the defeat of the Afghan army, Sher Ali, with the members\r\nof the Russian Mission then at Kabul, had fled to Turkestan, and that\r\nhis son, Yakub Khan, had been released from prison, and had assumed\r\nthe reins of Government.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, also, Sir Samuel Browne, who was at Jalalabad,\r\nreceived a letter[3] from the Amir, in which he announced his\r\nintention of proceeding to St. Petersburg to lay his case before the\r\nCzar and obtain the aid of Russia.\r\n\r\nSher Ali's disappearance and Yakub Khan's assumption of authority\r\nsuggested new possibilities to the Viceroy, who at once instructed\r\nMajor Cavagnari, the political officer with the Khyber column, to\r\ncommunicate, if possible, with Yakub Khan, and explain to him that our\r\nquarrel was with Sher Ali alone, that he might rest assured of the\r\nfriendly disposition of the British Government towards him personally,\r\nand that, unless he took the initiative, hostilities would not be\r\nresumed.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to Kuram, I invited all the Turis and Jajis who\r\nhad afforded us assistance to meet me in durbar that they might be\r\nsuitably rewarded. A goodly number responded to the invitation, and\r\nwere told, in accordance with the instructions I had received from\r\nthe Government of India, that they would henceforth be under British\r\nprotection; that no Amir of Afghanistan should ever again be permitted\r\nto tyrannize over them; that while they would be expected to live\r\npeaceably, neither their religion nor their customs would be\r\ninterfered with; that roads would be made and markets established, and\r\nthat whatever supplies they could provide for the use of the troops\r\nwould be liberally paid for.\r\n\r\nAfter this I started for Khost, accompanied by Colonel Waterfield, the\r\npolitical officer.\r\n\r\nThe column I took with me consisted of the squadron of the 10th\r\nHussars, 200 of the 72nd Highlanders, a wing of the 5th Punjab\r\nCavalry, the 21st and 28th Punjab Infantry, and Nos. 1 and 2 Mountain\r\nBatteries. The corps were so weak that their total strength only\r\namounted to 2,000 men.\r\n\r\nWe reached Matun, the name given to some three villages grouped round\r\na small fort in the centre of the valley, on the 6th January, 1879.\r\nThe Afghan Governor, with whom I had been in communication, met me and\r\narranged to surrender the fort, on condition that his personal safety\r\nshould be guaranteed, and that he should be allowed to go either to\r\nKabul or India, as he might desire.\r\n\r\nAbout half a mile from the fort I halted the column, and taking a\r\nsmall escort of the 10th Hussars, I rode on with the Governor, who\r\ninvited me with my staff into his house. While tea was being handed\r\nround, the Governor (Akram Khan by name) warned me that we should be\r\nattacked, and that he could do nothing to prevent it, having only some\r\n200 local militia and no regular troops. He further said that the\r\ninhabitants of the valley were not directly opposed to the British\r\nGovernment, and, if left to themselves, would give no trouble; but he\r\ndoubted their being able to resist the pressure put upon them by\r\na large number of tribesmen who had collected from the adjacent\r\ndistricts, attracted by the smallness of the force, which they\r\nbelieved 'had been delivered into their hands.'\r\n\r\nThis intelligence showed me I must be prepared for a scrimmage, so I\r\nordered the camp to be pitched in the form of a square as compactly as\r\npossible, with the transport animals and impedimenta in the centre,\r\nand strong piquets at the four angles. Cavalry patrols were sent out\r\nas far as the broken and hilly nature of the ground would permit, and\r\nevery endeavour was made to ascertain the strength and whereabouts\r\nof the enemy, but to no purpose: the enemy were invisible, and\r\nthe patrols reported that they had come across numbers of\r\npeaceable-looking husbandmen, but no one else.\r\n\r\nThe night passed off quietly, but when advancing day made them\r\nvisible, multitudes of tribesmen were descried collecting on the\r\nslopes of the neighbouring hills. Some friendly Natives were sent to\r\nascertain their intentions, followed by a Cavalry reconnoitring party,\r\nwhen suddenly a number of camel-drivers and mule-men, who had gone to\r\nthe nearest village to procure fodder for their animals, came rushing\r\nback to camp in the wildest terror and excitement, declaring that\r\nthe enemy seemed to rise as if by magic out of the ground, and that\r\nseveral thousands were already in the village. No doubt some of these\r\nwere 'the peaceable-looking husbandmen' the patrols had encountered\r\nthe previous day. I now became somewhat anxious, not only for the\r\nsafety of the reconnoitring party, which appeared to be in danger of\r\nbeing cut off, but for that of the whole force; such a mere handful as\r\nwe were compared to the numbers arrayed against us.\r\n\r\nVigorous action was evidently necessary. Accordingly, I ordered all\r\nthe available Cavalry (only 70 men of the 10th Hussars, and 155 of\r\nthe 5th Punjab Cavalry), under Colonel Hugh Gough, to follow the\r\nreconnoitring party in case of their being so hard pressed as to have\r\nto retire, and Captain Swinley's Mountain battery, with six companies\r\nof the 28th Punjab Infantry, under Colonel Hudson,[4] to move out\r\nin support. Colonel Drew I left in charge of the camp, with 200\r\nHighlanders, the 21st Punjab Infantry, and a Mountain battery. I\r\nmyself joined Gough, who, by dismounted fire and several bold charges,\r\nnotwithstanding the difficult nature of the ground, succeeded in\r\ndriving the enemy to the highest ridges, over which Swinley's\r\nwell-directed fire eventually forced them to retreat.\r\n\r\nHeavy firing was now heard in the direction of our camp, and I hurried\r\nback, taking with me a troop of the 5th Punjab Cavalry. I found that\r\nduring my absence Drew had been attacked on two sides; he had been\r\nable to prevent the enemy from coming to close quarters, but they were\r\nstill hovering about at no great distance, and I thought it advisable\r\nto clear them away by moving out against them with all the troops\r\nat my disposal. As we approached, they disappeared with their usual\r\nrapidity; the 5th Punjab Cavalry, however, got in amongst some of\r\nthem, and we returned to camp with 100 prisoners, 500 head of cattle,\r\nsome sheep, and a large quantity of grain.\r\n\r\nThe tribesmen, however, had not been sufficiently punished to prevent\r\na repetition of the attack, probably with largely increased numbers;\r\nso I ordered the destruction of the hamlets nearest us, in which they\r\nhad been sheltered and some of our camp followers had been murdered.\r\n\r\nThe next night a most unfortunate occurrence took place, resulting in\r\nthe death of six of our prisoners; but it was just one of those things\r\nwhich could hardly have been foreseen or guarded against, and for\r\nwhich, however lamentable, no one was to blame. The headmen of the\r\nparticular Waziri tribe to which the captives belonged had been\r\nsummoned during the day, and told that the men would be released on\r\npayment of a sum of fifty rupees each. The money was paid down at once\r\nfor a certain number, who were immediately set free; but there was not\r\nquite enough for all, and the headmen went off to procure what was\r\nrequired for the ransom of the remainder. Soon after dark, however,\r\nsome of the enemy[5] were discovered creeping up the banks of a nulla\r\nat the back of the camp, where the unransomed men were detained under\r\na guard; the nearest sentry instantly fired, and the piquets all round\r\ntook up the firing, thinking that another attack on the camp had\r\ncommenced. At the sound of the first shot the prisoners all jumped to\r\ntheir feet, and calling to each other to escape, attempted to seize\r\nthe rifles belonging to the guard, upon which the Native officer in\r\ncommand (a Pathan like themselves) told them that if they persisted in\r\ntrying to escape, they would be shot. His words had no effect, and to\r\nprevent his men being overpowered, he gave the order to fire. Six\r\nof the prisoners were killed and thirteen wounded. It was a most\r\nregrettable affair, but a Court of Inquiry decided that the Native\r\nofficer had no option, and completely exonerated the guard from\r\nacting with undue severity. The wounded were, of course, taken to our\r\nhospital, and well cared for by our Doctors.[6]\r\n\r\nThe remainder of our sojourn in Khost was not marked by any incident\r\nof particular interest. We marched to the end of the valley, and made\r\na careful survey of it and of the surrounding hills.\r\n\r\nThe instructions I received with regard to Khost were, to occupy the\r\nvalley and dislodge the Afghan administration therefrom. To my great\r\nchagrin, the smallness of my force made it impossible for me to give\r\neffect to these instructions as I could have wished. To have remained\r\nin Khost under the circumstances would have been to court disaster;\r\nthe numbers of the enemy were daily increasing, and it would have been\r\nimpossible to hold our own. It was, however, of great importance, if\r\npracticable, to retain some control over the valley, a peculiarly\r\nproductive district, which, if left alone by us, I feared would become\r\na centre of dangerous intrigue against any settled government in\r\nKuram. Accordingly I determined to try how placing Khost in charge of\r\none of our own Native officials would answer, and I selected for the\r\nposition Shahzada Sultan Jan, a Saddozai gentleman of good birth, and\r\na Sunni Mahomedan in religion, who, I thought, would be a _persona\r\ngrata_ to the Khostwals, and, if supported by some Native levies, and\r\nassociated in his administrative duties with the chief _maliks_ of\r\nKhost, would be more likely to hold his own than anyone else I could\r\nplace there. This was, however, a mere experiment, and I did not\r\ndisguise from myself that its success was very doubtful; but it was\r\nthe only way in which I could attempt to carry out the orders of\r\nGovernment, my hands being so completely tied by paucity of troops. I\r\nhad no fear for the Shahzada's personal safety, and I felt that, if\r\nin the end I should be obliged to abandon Khost altogether for the\r\npresent, it could later, if necessary, be easily re-occupied with a\r\nsomewhat larger force.\r\n\r\nHaving decided on the course to be adopted, I held a durbar, which was\r\nnumerously attended, and addressed the people of Khost in much the\r\nsame way I had spoken to the Turis in Kuram, expressing a hope that\r\nthey would support the Shahzada's authority until a more permanent\r\nform of government could be established.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th January we left Khost and made one march; the next day\r\nI halted, so as to be near the Shahzada in case of need. The\r\nintelligence brought to me that evening satisfied me that my\r\nexperiment would not answer, and that without troops (which I could\r\nnot spare) to support the newly-established authority at first\r\nstarting off, we could not hope to maintain any hold over the country;\r\nfor though the Khostwals themselves were perfectly content with the\r\narrangements I had made, they could not resist the tribesmen, who\r\ndirectly our backs were turned began to show their teeth. Accordingly,\r\nI decided to bring the Shahzada away while I could do so without\r\ntrouble. I marched back to Matun the next morning with 1,000 men\r\n(Cavalry and Infantry) and four Mountain guns. We found Sultan Jan in\r\nanything but a happy frame of mind, and quite ready to come away. So\r\nhaving formally made the place over to the _maliks_, we started on our\r\nreturn journey. As we departed, a collection of our tribal enemies\r\n(about 3,000) who had been watching the proceedings took the\r\nopportunity to attack us; but two weak squadrons of Cavalry, skilfully\r\nhandled by Hugh Gough, kept them in check, and we reached camp without\r\nfurther molestation.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the last of January, we returned to Hazir Pir in Kuram.\r\nThere I received a visit from Sirdar Wali Mahomed Khan, brother of\r\nSher Ali, who was accompanied by several leading men of the Logar\r\nvalley, some of whom were of great assistance to me a few months\r\nlater. Wali Mahomed was a man of about fifty years of age; he had a\r\npleasing countenance, of the same Jewish type as the majority of the\r\nAfghan nation, but he had a weak face and was evidently wanting in\r\ncharacter. He told me that he had fled from Kabul to escape the\r\nvengeance of his nephew, Yakub Khan, who attributed his long\r\nimprisonment by his father to the Sirdar's influence. Sir Samuel\r\nBrowne and Major Cavagnari, on the Khyber line, were conducting all\r\npolitical negotiations with the Afghans, so I passed Wali Mahomed Khan\r\non to them.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of February my time was chiefly employed in\r\ninspecting the roads and the defensive posts which my talented\r\nand indefatigable Chief Engineer was constructing, examining the\r\narrangements for housing the troops, and looking after the transport\r\nanimals and Commissariat depots. No more military demonstrations were\r\nnecessary, for the people were quietly settling down under British\r\nrule. Convoys were no longer molested nor telegraph wires cut; but I\r\nhad one rather unpleasant incident with regard to a war Correspondent,\r\nwhich, until the true facts of the case were understood, brought\r\nme into disrepute with one of the leading London newspapers, the\r\nrepresentative of which I felt myself compelled to dismiss from the\r\nKuram Field Force.\r\n\r\nJudging from his telegrams, which he brought to me to sign, the nerves\r\nof the Correspondent in question must have been somewhat shaken by the\r\nfew and very distant shots fired at us on the 28th November. These\r\ntelegrams being in many instances absolutely incorrect and of the most\r\nalarming nature, were of course not allowed to be despatched until\r\nthey had been revised in accordance with truth; but one, evidently\r\naltered and added to after I had countersigned it, was brought to me\r\nby the telegraph master. I sent for the Correspondent, who confessed\r\nto having made the alterations, not apparently realizing that he had\r\ndone anything at all reprehensible, but he promised that he would\r\nnever do such a thing again. This promise was not kept; telegrams\r\nappeared in his paper which I had not seen before despatch, and which\r\nwere most misleading to the British public. Moreover, his letters,\r\nover which I could have no control, and which I heard of for the\r\nfirst time when the copies of his paper arrived in Kuram, were most\r\nsubversive of the truth. It was on the receipt of these letters that I\r\nfelt it to be my duty to send the too imaginative author to the rear.\r\n\r\nNo one could be more anxious than I was to have all details of the\r\ncampaign made public. I considered it due to the people of Great\r\nBritain that the press Correspondents should have every opportunity\r\nfor giving the fullest and most faithful accounts of what might happen\r\nwhile the army was in the field, and I took special pains from the\r\nfirst to treat the Correspondents with confidence, and give them such\r\ninformation as it was in my power to afford. All I required from them\r\nin return was that the operations should be truthfully reported, and\r\nthat any Correspondent who did not confine himself to the recording\r\nof facts, and felt himself competent to criticize the conduct of the\r\ncampaign, should be careful to acquaint himself with the many and\r\nvaried reasons which a Commander must always have to consider before\r\ndeciding on any line of action.\r\n\r\nWhat to my mind was so reprehensible in this Correspondent's conduct\r\nwas the publication, in time of war, and consequent excitement and\r\nanxiety at home, of incorrect and sensational statements, founded on\r\ninformation derived from irresponsible and uninformed sources, and\r\nthe alteration of telegrams after they had been countersigned by the\r\nrecognized authority, the result of which could only be to keep the\r\npublic in a state of apprehension regarding the force in the field,\r\nand, what is even more to be deprecated, to weaken the confidence\r\nof the troops in their Commander. It was satisfactory to me that my\r\naction in the matter met with the fullest approval of the Viceroy.\r\n\r\nAbout this time my column was strengthened by the arrival of the\r\nContingent provided by the Punjab Chiefs, under the command of\r\nBrigadier General John Watson, my comrade of the Mutiny days. The\r\nContingent consisted of 868 Cavalry, and 2,685 Infantry with 13 guns,\r\nwhich were placed in position along the line of communication, and\r\nproved of great use in relieving the Regular army of escort duty.\r\nThe senior Native officer with the Punjabis was Bakshi Ganda Sing,\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Patiala army, a particularly handsome,\r\ngentlemanly Sikh, with whom I have ever since been on terms of\r\nfriendly intercourse.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of February I paid a visit to Kohat, where my wife met\r\nme; we spent a week together, and I had the pleasure of welcoming to\r\nthe frontier that grand regiment, the 92nd Highlanders, which had\r\nbeen sent up to be in readiness to join my column in the event of an\r\nadvance on Kabul becoming necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1:\r\n\r\n    'FROM THE VICEROY, LAHORE, TO GENERAL ROBERTS.\r\n    '_6th December, 1878._\r\n\r\n    'I have much pleasure in communicating to you and the force\r\n    under your command the following telegram just received\r\n    Her Majesty, and desire at the same time to add my warm\r\n    congratulations on the success achieved.

A member of the House of Commons, in commenting upon\r\nit, said that 'some ninety prisoners, who had been taken, had been\r\ntied together with ropes'; that 'on their making some attempt to\r\nescape they were set upon, and many of them slaughtered in their\r\nbonds'; and that 'the dead, the living, the dying, and the wounded\r\nwere left tied together, and lying in one confused mass of bodies.']\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n1879\r\n\r\n  Sher Ali's death--Premature negotiations--The treaty of Gandamak\r\n  --Making friends with the tribesmen--Gloomy forebodings\r\n  --Good-bye to Cavagnari\r\n\r\n\r\nI was informed by the Viceroy's Private Secretary in the beginning of\r\nMarch that, unless satisfactory arrangements could soon be come to\r\nwith Yakub Khan, an onward move would have to be made. Accordingly I\r\nnow set about preparing for such a contingency.\r\n\r\nSher Ali had died in Afghan Turkestan on the 21st February, and, in\r\ncommunicating the event to the Viceroy, Yakub Khan wrote that he was\r\nanxious matters might be so arranged that 'the friendship of this\r\nGod-granted State with the illustrious British Government may remain\r\nconstant and firm.'\r\n\r\nThe new Amir was told in reply that Lord Lytton was prepared to enter\r\ninto negotiations for the conclusion of peace, and for the restoration\r\nof a friendly alliance between the two Governments, provided that His\r\nHighness renounced all claim to authority over the Khyber and Michni\r\nPasses, and the independent tribes inhabiting the territory directly\r\nconnected with the main routes leading to India; that the district\r\nof Kuram from Thal to the crest of the Shutargardan Pass, and the\r\ndistricts of Pishin and Sibi, should remain under the control of the\r\nBritish Government; that the foreign relations of Afghanistan should\r\nbe conducted in accordance with the advice and wishes of the British\r\nGovernment; and that British officers should be accredited to the\r\nKabul Government, and permitted to reside at such places as might\r\nhereafter be decided upon.\r\n\r\nYakub Khan's reply was not altogether satisfactory. He agreed to\r\nBritish officers being deputed to Afghanistan on the understanding\r\nthat they should reside in Kabul, and abstain from interference in\r\nState affairs; but he declined to renounce his authority over the\r\nKhyber and Michni Passes and the tribes in their vicinity, and refused\r\nto consent to Kuram, Pishin, and Sibi being placed under British\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nThe Viceroy now determined to try what a personal conference between\r\nthe Amir and Cavagnari could effect towards a settlement of these\r\nvexed questions, so in answering the Amir Cavagnari was directed\r\nto convey a hint that an invitation to him to visit Kabul might be\r\nproductive of good results, and to point out that the places we\r\ndesired to occupy were looked upon as essential to the permanent\r\nsecurity of the Indian frontier. The Amir replied, expressing his\r\nreadiness to receive Cavagnari in his capital, and laying stress on\r\nhis determination to regulate his future conduct in strict conformity\r\nwith his professions of loyalty, but begged that he might not be\r\ncalled upon to cede any portion of his territory.\r\n\r\nHardly had this letter, dated the 29th March, been received, than a\r\nproclamation addressed by Yakub to the Khagianis, a tribe which had\r\nbeen giving much trouble, was intercepted and brought to Cavagnari; in\r\nit the Amir praised and complimented the Khagianis for their religious\r\nzeal and fidelity to himself. He exhorted them to have no fear of the\r\ninfidels, against whom he was about to launch an irresistible force of\r\ntroops and _Ghazis_, and wound up as follows: 'By the favour of\r\nGod, and in accordance with the verse \"Verily God has destroyed the\r\npowerful ones,\" the whole of them will go to the fire of hell for\r\nevermore. Therefore kill them to the extent of your ability.' A\r\ncurious commentary this on the Amir's protestation of loyalty.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this piece of treachery, it was decided not to break\r\noff negotiations, and Yakub Khan was informed by Cavagnari that a\r\nMission would proceed to Kabul so soon as the necessary arrangements\r\ncould be made for its reception. At the same time Lord Lytton himself\r\nwrote to the Amir, telling him that, as he was willing to receive an\r\nEnvoy, Cavagnari would be deputed to visit Kabul, and communicate\r\nunreservedly with him upon the questions at issue between the two\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nI, personally, was not at all satisfied that the time had come for\r\nnegotiation, for I felt that the Afghans had not had the sense of\r\ndefeat sufficiently driven into them to convince them of our strength\r\nand ability to punish breach of treaty, and, therefore, that a peace\r\nmade now, before they had been thoroughly beaten, would not be a\r\nlasting one, and would only end in worse trouble in the near future.\r\nThe Afghans are an essentially arrogant and conceited people; they had\r\nnot forgotten our disastrous retreat from Kabul, nor the annihilation\r\nof our array in the Khurd Kabul and Jagdalak Passes in 1842, and\r\nbelieved themselves to be quite capable of resisting our advance on\r\nKabul. No great battle had as yet been fought; though Ali Masjid and\r\nthe Peiwar Kotal had been taken, a small force of the enemy had been\r\nbeaten by Charles Gough's brigade, near Jalalabad, and a successful\r\nCavalry skirmish had occurred near Kandahar, the Afghans had nowhere\r\nsuffered serious loss, and it was not to be wondered at if the\r\nfighting men in distant villages, and in and around Kabul, Ghazni,\r\nHerat, Balkh, and other places, still considered themselves undefeated\r\nand capable of defying us. They and their leaders had to depend for\r\ninformation as to recent events upon the garbled accounts of those who\r\nhad fought against us, and it was unlikely they would be shaken in\r\ntheir belief in their superiority by such one-sided versions of what\r\nhad occurred. On many occasions I had been amused, in listening to\r\nAfghan conversation, to find that, while they appeared thoroughly\r\nconversant with and frequently alluded to their triumphs over us, they\r\nseemed to know nothing, or had no recollection, of Sale's successful\r\ndefence of Jalalabad, or of Pollock's victorious march through the\r\nKhyber Pass and the destruction by him of the chief bazaar in Kabul.\r\n\r\nMy ideas about the negotiations being premature were freely expressed\r\nto Colonel Colley,[1] Lord Lytton's Private Secretary, who paid me a\r\nvisit in Kuram at this time, and had been a constant correspondent of\r\nmine from the commencement of the war. Colley, however, explained to\r\nme that, right or wrong, the Viceroy had no option in the matter; that\r\nthere was the strongest feeling in England against the continuance of\r\nthe war; and that, unless the new Amir proved actively hostile, peace\r\nmust be signed. He expressed himself sanguine that the terms of the\r\ntreaty which Cavagnari hoped to conclude with Yakub Khan would give us\r\nan improved frontier, and a permanent paramount influence at Kabul,\r\nthe two points about which he said the Viceroy was most anxious, and\r\nto which he assigned the first place in his political programme. Lord\r\nLytton foresaw that, whatever might be the future policy of the two\r\nEuropean Powers concerned, the contact of the frontiers of Great\r\nBritain and Russia in Asia was only a matter of time, and his aim was\r\nto make sure that the conterminous line, whenever it might be reached,\r\nshould be of our choosing, and not one depending on the exigencies of\r\nthe moment, or on the demands of Russia.\r\n\r\nThe Native agent (Bukhtiar Khan), who was the bearer of the Viceroy's\r\nand Cavagnari's letters to the Amir, reached Kabul at the moment\r\nwhen the Afghan officials who had accompanied Sher Ali in his flight\r\nreturned to that place from Turkestan. Counsel was held with these men\r\nas to the manner of receiving the British Mission; but there was an\r\ninfluential military party averse to peace, and the Amir was strongly\r\nadvised to abandon the English alliance and trust to Russia. Upon\r\nhearing this, our agent became alarmed for the safety of the Mission,\r\nand being apprehensive that Yakub Khan would not have the power to\r\nprotect its members from insult, he suggested to the Amir that he\r\nshould visit our camp instead of the British Mission coming to Kabul,\r\na suggestion which was ultimately adopted, the Viceroy considering\r\nthat it was infinitely the best arrangement that could be made.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th May the Amir arrived in Sir Samuel Browne's camp at\r\nGandamak, thirty miles on the Kabul side of Jalalabad, and on the\r\n26th, owing to the tact and diplomatic skill of Louis Cavagnari, the\r\nTreaty of Gandamak was signed, and so ended the first phase of the\r\nsecond Afghan war.\r\n\r\nUnder the terms of the treaty, Yakub Khan agreed to the cession of\r\nterritory considered necessary by us, and bound himself to conduct\r\nhis foreign policy in accordance with the advice of the British\r\nGovernment; while, on our side, we promised to support him against\r\nexternal aggression. It was further arranged that a British\r\nrepresentative, with a suitable escort, should reside at Kabul;[2]\r\nthat the Amir should in like manner (if he desired it) depute an agent\r\nto the Viceregal Court; that British agents with sufficient escorts\r\nshould be at liberty to visit the Afghan frontiers whenever, in the\r\ninterests of both countries, it was considered necessary by the\r\nBritish Government; that there should be no hindrance to British\r\nsubjects trading peaceably within the Amir's dominions; that traders\r\nshould be protected, the transit of merchandise facilitated, and roads\r\nkept in good order; that a line of telegraph should be constructed\r\nfrom India to Kabul, at the expense of the British, but under the\r\nprotection of the Afghan Government; and that an annual subsidy of six\r\nlakhs of rupees should be paid to the Amir and his successors.\r\n\r\nThe Khyber column was now withdrawn, with the exception of two\r\nbrigades, and orders were sent to the Kandahar column to prepare to\r\nwithdraw on the 1st September, the earliest date at which the troops\r\ncould safely march through the Bolan Pass. I was told to stay where\r\nI was, as Kuram, by the treaty conditions, was to remain under our\r\ncontrol and be administered by the British Government.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th May I held a parade in honour of the Queen's birthday, at\r\nwhich 6,450 officers and men were present.[3] They were thoroughly fit\r\nand workmanlike, and being anxious that the tribesmen should see what\r\ngrand soldiers I had at hand should an advance be necessary, I invited\r\nall the neighbouring clans to witness the display. The Afghans were\r\nseated in picturesque groups round the flag-staff, when suddenly, as\r\nthe first round of the _feu-de-joie_ was fired, they started to their\r\nfeet, thinking that treachery was intended, and that they were\r\ncaught in a trap: they took to their heels, and we had considerable\r\ndifficulty in bringing them back, and in making them understand that\r\nthe firing which had so upset their equanimity was only a sign of\r\nrejoicing on that auspicious anniversary. By degrees they became\r\nassured that there was no thought of taking an unfair advantage of\r\nthem, and at the conclusion of the ceremony they were made happy by a\r\npresent of sheep. In the afternoon an impromptu rifle meeting was got\r\nup. The matchlock men could not hold their own against our good shots\r\narmed with Martini-Henry rifles, a fact which evidently greatly\r\nimpressed the tribesmen, some of whom then and there came forward and\r\npromised that if I should be required to advance on Kabul they would\r\nnot oppose me.\r\n\r\nI took advantage of our improved relations with the Afghans,\r\nconsequent on the ratification of the treaty, to enlarge our\r\ngeographical knowledge of the passes which lead from Kuram towards\r\nKabul, and the independent territories in the neighbourhood. The\r\npresence of the troops, no doubt, had something to say to the cheerful\r\nacquiescence of the tribesmen in these explorations, which they\r\nappeared to look upon as the result of a wish to make ourselves\r\nacquainted with the country assigned to us by the treaty, and having,\r\nto use their own expression, lifted for us the _purdah_ (curtain) of\r\ntheir country, they became most friendly, and took a curious pleasure\r\nin pointing out to us the points of defence at which they would have\r\nopposed us, had we been advancing as enemies.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of June I heard from Lord Lytton that he wished me to\r\nbe one of the military members of a Commission of Inquiry into army\r\nexpenditure and organization which was about to be convened at Simla,\r\nif I thought I could be spared from my post at Kuram. The people of\r\nthe valley had by this time settled down so contentedly, and the\r\ntribesmen showed themselves so peacefully disposed, that I thought I\r\ncould safely leave my post for a time, before returning to take up my\r\nabode in the neighbourhood for some years, as I hoped to do, when my\r\nappointment as Frontier Commissioner should have received the sanction\r\nof the authorities in England.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, some temporary arrangement was necessary for the\r\nadministration of Kuram, and I wrote to the Foreign Secretary (Alfred\r\nLyall), pointing out my views upon the subject.\r\n\r\nSeeing how much could be done with these wild people by personal\r\ninfluence, and how ready they were to submit to my decisions when\r\ndisputes arose amongst them--decisions at times literally given from\r\nthe saddle--I was very adverse to their being handed over to some\r\nofficial who, from his training, would not be able to understand\r\ndealing out the rough-and-ready justice which alone was suited to\r\nthese lawless beings, and who could not imagine any question being\r\nproperly settled without its having undergone the tedious process of\r\npassing through the law courts. Such a rule would, I knew, disgust\r\na people accustomed to decide their quarrels at the point of the\r\nsword--a people to whom law and order had been hitherto unknown,\r\nand must be distasteful, until they had had time to realize their\r\nbeneficial effects. Profitable employment and judicious management\r\nwould in time, no doubt, turn them into peaceful subjects. Friendly\r\nintercourse had already done much towards this end, and tribes who for\r\ngenerations had been at feud with each other now met, when visiting\r\nour camp, on common ground, without (much I think to their own\r\nastonishment) wanting to cut each other's throats. What was further\r\nrequired, I conceived, was the opening up of the country by means of\r\nroads, which would facilitate intercommunication and give remunerative\r\nemployment to thousands who had hitherto lived by plunder and\r\nbloodshed.\r\n\r\nIn answering my letter, the Foreign Secretary informed me that the\r\nfuture of Kuram would be settled when I reached Simla, whither I\r\nwas to proceed so soon as I had seen the British Mission across the\r\nfrontier.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th July Major Cavagnari, who had been selected as 'the Envoy\r\nand Plenipotentiary to His Highness the Amir of Kabul,' arrived in\r\nKuram, accompanied by Mr. William Jenkins, C.I.E., of the Civil\r\nService, and Lieutenant Hamilton, V.C., Surgeon-Major Kelly, 25\r\nCavalry and 50 Infantry of the Guides Corps. I, with some fifty\r\nofficers who were anxious to do honour to the Envoy and see the\r\ncountry beyond Kuram, marched with Cavagnari to within five miles of\r\nthe crest of the Shutargardan Pass, where we encamped, and my staff\r\nand I dined that evening with the Mission. After dinner I was asked to\r\npropose the health of Cavagnari and those with him, but somehow I did\r\nnot feel equal to the task; I was so thoroughly depressed, and my mind\r\nwas filled with such gloomy forebodings as to the fate of these fine\r\nfellows, that I could not utter a word. Like many others, I thought\r\nthat peace had been signed too quickly, before, in fact, we had\r\ninstilled that awe of us into the Afghan nation which would have been\r\nthe only reliable guarantee for the safety of the Mission. Had we\r\nshown our strength by marching to Kabul in the first instance, whether\r\nopposed or not, and there dictated the terms of the treaty, there\r\nwould have been some assurance for its being adhered to; as it was,\r\nI could not help feeling there was none, and that the chances were\r\nagainst the Mission ever coming back.\r\n\r\nCavagnari, however, showed no sign of sharing my forebodings; he and\r\nhis companions were in the best of spirits; he spoke most hopefully of\r\nthe future, and talked of a tour he hoped to make with me in the cold\r\nweather along the northern and western frontiers of Afghanistan. Other\r\nmatters of intense interest to us both were discussed, and before\r\nseparating for the night it was arranged that Mrs. Cavagnari should\r\neither join him in Kabul the following spring, or come and stay with\r\nmy wife and me in Kuram, where I had already laid the foundations of a\r\nhouse near the beautifully situated village of Shalufzan.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning the Sirdar, who had been deputed by the Amir to\r\nreceive the Mission, came into camp, and soon we all started for the\r\ntop of the pass. We had gone about a mile, when we were joined by an\r\nescort of Afghan Cavalry, dressed something like British Dragoons,\r\nwith the exception of their head-gear, which consisted of the\r\ndiscarded helmets of the old Bengal Horse Artillery. They were mounted\r\non small, useful-looking horses, and were armed with smooth-bore\r\ncarbines and _tulwars_ (Native swords).\r\n\r\nAs we ascended, curiously enough, we came across a solitary magpie,\r\nwhich I should not have noticed had not Cavagnari pointed it out and\r\nbegged me not to mention the fact of his having seen it to his wife,\r\nas she would be sure to consider it an unlucky omen.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the Afghan camp, we were received in a large, tastefully\r\ndecorated tent, where tea was served, and we were afterwards conducted\r\nto the top of the mountain, where carpets were spread and more tea\r\npassed round, while we gazed on the fine view of the Logar valley\r\nwhich stretched out beneath us.\r\n\r\nOn descending to the camp, we were invited to partake of dinner,\r\nserved in Oriental fashion on a carpet spread on the ground.\r\nEverything was done most lavishly and gracefully, and nothing was\r\nomitted that was calculated to do us honour. Nevertheless, I could not\r\nfeel happy as to the prospects of the Mission, and my heart sank as I\r\nwished Cavagnari good-bye. When we had proceeded a few yards in our\r\ndifferent directions, we both turned round, retraced our steps, shook\r\nhands once more, and parted for ever.\r\n\r\nI did not delay at Kuram; there was nothing to keep me there, and the\r\nprospect of getting back to my belongings and to civilization, now\r\nthat all active work was at an end, was too alluring to be withstood.\r\nMy wife met me at the foot of the Hills, and we drove up to Simla\r\ntogether. I was greeted by Lord Lytton and many kind friends most\r\nwarmly, and had the gratification of hearing that I had been made a\r\nK.C.B., and that I had been accorded the thanks of both Houses of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nI was soon deep in the work of the Army Commission, which met for\r\nthe first time under the presidency of the Hon. Sir Ashley Eden,[4]\r\nK.C.S.I., on the 1st August. The heavy loss to the revenues of India,\r\nconsequent on the unfavourable rate of exchange, rendered extensive\r\nreductions in public expenditure imperative, and the object of this\r\nCommission was to find out how the cost of the army could be reduced\r\nwithout impairing its efficiency.\r\n\r\nVery little was done at the first meeting, and at its close Eden\r\nconfessed to me that he did not at all see his way, and that he was\r\nsomewhat aghast at the difficulties of the task before the Commission.\r\nTo me it seemed clear that the maintenance of a separate army for each\r\npresidency, Bengal, Bombay, and Madras, was at the root of the evils\r\nit was our duty to consider and try to reform; and I promised the\r\nPresident that, before the Commission again assembled, I would prepare\r\na scheme which might form a basis for them to work upon.\r\n\r\nI considered it an anachronism, since railways and telegraphs had\r\nannihilated distance, to keep up three Commanders-in-Chief, and\r\nseparate departments, each having an independent head, in the three\r\ndifferent presidencies. I put my ideas on paper, and Eden announced\r\nhimself in favour of my scheme, which substituted for the three\r\npresidential armies four army corps, all subordinate to the\r\nCommander-in-Chief in India. Portions of my recommendation began to\r\nbe carried into effect directly they had received the sanction of the\r\nauthorities in England--such as the amalgamation of the Commissariat,\r\nPay, Ordnance, and Stud departments--but it was not until April,\r\n1895, sixteen years after the proposal had been recommended by the\r\nGovernment of India, and although, during that period, four successive\r\nViceroys, each backed up by a unanimous Council, had declared\r\nthemselves strongly in favour of the change, that the finishing touch\r\nwas given to the new organization, by the abolition of the offices of\r\nCommanders-in-Chief of Madras and Bombay, and the creation of four\r\nArmy Corps, namely, the Punjab, the Bengal, the Madras, and the\r\nBombay, each commanded by a Lieutenant-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The late Major-General Sir George Colley, K.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Kabul was expressly selected by Yakub Khan as the place\r\nwhere he wished the Embassy to reside.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: At this parade I had the great pleasure of decorating\r\nCaptain Cook with the Victoria Cross, and Subadar Ragobir Nagarkoti,\r\nJemadar Pursoo Khatri, Native Doctor Sankar Dass, and five riflemen of\r\nthe 5th Gurkhas, with the Order of Merit, for their gallant conduct\r\nin the attack on the Spingawi Kotal, and during the passage of the\r\nMangior defile. It was a happy circumstance that Major Galbraith, who\r\nowed his life to Captain Cook's intrepidity, and Major Fitz-Hugh,\r\nwhose life was saved by Jemadar (then Havildar) Pursoo Khatri, should\r\nboth have been present on the parade.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n1879\r\n\r\n  Massacre of the Embassy--The Kabul Field Force\r\n  --Lord Lytton's foresightedness--Start for Kabul--Letter to the Amir\r\n  --Proclamation to the people of Kabul--Yakub Khan's agents\r\n  --Reasons for remaining at Alikhel\r\n\r\n\r\nMy wife and I thought and talked much over our new life on the\r\nfrontier, to which we both looked forward with great interest and\r\npleasure, but, before entering upon it, we settled to go home for\r\na time to place our boy at school and see our friends, and we were\r\narranging our plans accordingly, when suddenly our 'castles in the\r\nair' were dashed to the ground by a ruthless blow from the hand of\r\nFate, and the whole of India, the whole of the civilized world, was\r\nstruck with grief, horror, and indignation at the awful news of the\r\nmassacre at Kabul of Cavagnari and his gallant companions.\r\n\r\nThroughout the month of August telegrams and letters constantly came\r\nfrom Cavagnari (now a Lieutenant-Colonel and a K.C.B.) to the Viceroy,\r\nthe Foreign Secretary, and myself, in which he always expressed\r\nhimself in such a manner as to lead to the belief that he was\r\nperfectly content with his position, and felt himself quite secure;\r\nand in his very last letter, dated the 30th August, received after his\r\ndeath, he wrote: 'I personally believe that Yakub Khan will turn out\r\nto be a very good ally, and that we shall be able to keep him to\r\nhis engagements.' His last telegram to the Viceroy, dated the 2nd\r\nSeptember, concluded with the words, 'All well.' Cavagnari mentioned\r\nin one of his letters that the Afghan soldiers were inclined to be\r\nmutinous, and in another that a dispute had arisen in the bazaar\r\nbetween them and the men of the British escort, but at the same time\r\nhe expressed his confidence in the Amir's ability and determination\r\nto maintain order; I could not, however, help being anxious about\r\nCavagnari, or divest myself of the feeling that he might be\r\nover-estimating Yakub Khan's power, even if His Highness had the will,\r\nto protect the Mission.\r\n\r\nBetween one and two o'clock on the morning of the 5th September, I was\r\nawakened by my wife telling me that a telegraph man had been wandering\r\nround the house and calling for some time, but that no one had\r\nanswered him.[1] I got up, went downstairs, and, taking the telegram\r\nfrom the man, brought it up to my dressing-room, and opened it; it\r\nproved to be from Captain Conolly, Political Officer at Alikhel, dated\r\nthe 4th September. The contents told me that my worst fears--fears I\r\nhad hardly acknowledged to myself--had been only too fully realized.\r\nThe telegram ran:\r\n\r\n    'One Jelaladin Ghilzai, who says he is in Sir Louis Cavagnari's\r\n    secret service, has arrived in hot haste from Kabul, and solemnly\r\n    states that yesterday morning the Residency was attacked by three\r\n    regiments who had mutinied for their pay, they having guns, and\r\n    being joined by a portion of six other regiments. The Embassy\r\n    and escort were defending themselves when he left about noon\r\n    yesterday. I hope to receive further news.'\r\n\r\nI was paralyzed for the moment, but was roused by my wife calling out,\r\n'What is it? Is it bad news from Kabul?' She had divined my fears\r\nabout Cavagnari, and had been as anxious about him as I had been\r\nmyself. I replied, 'Yes, very bad, if true. I hope it is not.' But I\r\nfelt it was. I woke my A.D.C., and sent him off at once to the Viceroy\r\nwith the telegram. The evil tidings spread rapidly. I was no sooner\r\ndressed than Mr. Alfred Lyall arrived. We talked matters over, I\r\ndespatched a telegram[2] to Captain Conolly, and we then went off to\r\nLord Lytton.\r\n\r\nEarly as it was, I found the Council assembled. The gravity of the\r\nsituation was thoroughly appreciated, and it was unanimously decided\r\nthat, should the disastrous report prove to be true, troops must\r\nproceed to Kabul with the least possible delay to avenge or, if\r\nhappily incorrect or exaggerated, to support the Mission.\r\n\r\nSir Samuel Browne's force had been broken up, Sir Donald Stewart was\r\nin far off Kandahar, and his troops had, all but a small number, left\r\non their return march to India; the Kuram force was, therefore, the\r\nonly one in a position to reach Kabul quickly, and I was ordered to\r\nproceed at once to Kuram and resume my command.\r\n\r\nAs a preliminary measure, Brigadier-General Massy, who had been placed\r\nin temporary command during my absence, was directed to move troops\r\nto the Shutargardan, where they were to entrench themselves and await\r\norders, while Stewart was directed to stop all regiments on their way\r\nback to India, and himself hold fast at Kandahar.\r\n\r\nDuring the day further telegrams were received confirming the truth of\r\nthe first report, and telling of the Mission having been overwhelmed\r\nand every member of it cruelly massacred; and later Captain Conolly\r\ntelegraphed that messengers had arrived from the Amir bringing two\r\nletters addressed to me giving his version of what had occurred.\r\n\r\nDuring the few hours I remained at Simla I was busily engaged in\r\ndiscussing with Sir Frederick Haines the formation of the Kabul Field\r\nForce,[3] as my new command was designated, and the many important\r\nmatters which had to be considered. More troops had to be hurried up,\r\nfor it would be necessary to hold Kuram in strength while I moved\r\non to Kabul, and, as communication by the Shutargardan could not be\r\ndepended upon after December, on account of snow, the Khyber route\r\nwould have to be opened out.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the last year's campaign my anxiety had been so\r\nlargely increased by having been given officers totally inexperienced\r\nin war to fill the higher posts in the Kuram column, that I did not\r\nhesitate to press upon the Commander-in-Chief, now that I had a far\r\nmore difficult operation to carry through, the importance of my senior\r\nofficers being tried men on whom I could implicitly rely; and I\r\nsucceeded in getting for the command of my two Infantry brigades\r\nHerbert Macpherson[4] and T. D. Baker,[5] the Viceroy's Military\r\nSecretary, both of whom had seen a good deal of service, while the\r\nformer had already commanded a brigade in the field.\r\n\r\nTo the command of the Artillery and Cavalry, Lieutenant-Colonel B.\r\nGordon and Brigadier-General Massy were appointed, neither of whom had\r\nmuch experience of war. Gordon had served in Central India during\r\nthe Mutiny, and Massy by his pluck as a subaltern of Infantry in the\r\nCrimea had gained for himself the _sobriquet_ of 'Redan' Massy. But\r\nhe had not served with Cavalry in the field, and from my slight\r\nacquaintance with him I could not say whether he possessed the very\r\nexceptional qualities required in a Cavalry Commander.\r\n\r\nMy staff had proved themselves so capable and reliable that I had no\r\nwish to make any change; it was, however, materially strengthened by\r\nthe addition of Colonel MacGregor,[6] as 'Chief of the Staff,' with\r\nCaptain Combe,[7] 10th Hussars, and Lieutenant Manners Smith[8] as\r\nDeputy-Assistant Quartermaster-Generals.\r\n\r\nMr. H.M. Durand[9] was attached to me as Political Secretary, and\r\nMajor Hastings as Political Officer, in place of Colonel Waterfield,\r\nwho was _hors de combat_ from a broken leg. Hugh Gough, with the rank\r\nof Brigadier-General, and Major Mark Heathcote as his assistant, were\r\nplaced in charge of the lines of communication.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Simla I paid a farewell visit to Lord Lytton. I found\r\nhim in a state of deep distress and depression. To a man of his\r\naffectionate disposition, the fate of Cavagnari, for whom he had a\r\ngreat personal regard, was a real grief. But on public grounds he felt\r\nstill more strongly the collapse of the Mission and the consequent\r\nheavy blow to the policy he had so much at heart, viz., the\r\nrectification of our defective frontier, and the rendering India\r\nsecure against foreign aggression--a policy which, though scouted at\r\nthe time by a party which later became all-powerful, has since been\r\njustified by the action of successive Governments, Liberal and\r\nConservative alike, until at the present moment our frontier is\r\ngradually becoming what Lord Lytton, with his clear foresightedness\r\nand intelligent appreciation of our responsibilities and India's\r\nrequirements, would then have made it.\r\n\r\nIn answer to my request for instructions as to the line I should take\r\nabout our future relations with the Afghans, Lord Lytton said:\r\n'You can tell them we shall never again altogether withdraw from\r\nAfghanistan, and that those who help you will be befriended and\r\nprotected by the British Government.'\r\n\r\nWhile I was with Lord Lytton, a telegram[10] was brought in from\r\nCaptain Conolly, reporting the details of the attack upon the Embassy,\r\nas given to him by the messenger who had been entrusted by the Amir\r\nto deliver the two letters addressed to me. In this telegram Conolly\r\nsolicited instructions as to what he was to communicate to the Amir in\r\nreply to His Highness's request for aid, and inquired whether he was\r\nat liberty to make terms with one Badshah Khan, an influential Ghilzai\r\nChief, who had come to Alikhel to offer his services.\r\n\r\nThe following telegram was sent in reply by the Foreign Secretary:\r\n\r\n    'Your telegram 6th. Reply to the Amir at once from the Viceroy\r\n    that a strong British force under General Roberts will march\r\n    speedily on Kabul to his relief, from the Shutargardan, and\r\n    that he should use all his resources to co-operate with, and\r\n    facilitate, the advance of the troops through his country. Your\r\n    proposal to subsidize Badshah Khan and accept his services is\r\n    approved. Roberts will send detailed instructions.'\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon of the same day (September 6th) I left Simla,\r\naccompanied by my wife as far as Umballa, where I found my staff\r\nwaiting for me. She saw us off in the train, bidding us a cheery\r\ngood-bye and good luck, but I am afraid the return journey must have\r\nbeen a sad one for her.\r\n\r\nThought for the immediate future filled my mind as we sped on our way\r\nto the front, and not a few difficulties connected with the proposed\r\nadvance on Kabul presented themselves to me. My chief causes for\r\nanxiety were the insufficiency of transport, and the great extent of\r\nthe lines of communication which would have to be guarded. It would\r\nbe necessary to hold the country in strength from Thal to the\r\nShutargardan, a distance of 115 miles, until such time as the Khyber\r\nroute could be opened, and I felt that the force at my disposal\r\n(7,500 men and 22 guns) was none too large for the work before\r\nit, considering that I should have to provide a garrison for the\r\nShutargardan, if not for other posts between that place and Kabul.\r\n\r\nMy Commissariat arrangements, too, caused me many misgivings,\r\nincreased by the fact that Major Badcock, my chief Commissariat\r\nOfficer, and Major Collett, my Assistant Quartermaster-General, who\r\nhad afforded such valuable aid in Kuram, thinking the war was at an\r\nend, had taken leave to England. My doubts vanished, however, and my\r\nspirits rose at the sight of my brave troops, and the enthusiastic\r\nwelcome they gave me as I rode through Kuram on the 12th September on\r\nmy way to Alikhel. A splendid spirit pervaded the whole force; the\r\nmen's hearts were on fire with eager desire to press on to Kabul, and\r\nbe led against the miscreants who had foully massacred our countrymen,\r\nand I felt assured that whatever it was possible for dauntless\r\ncourage, unselfish devotion, and firm determination to achieve, would\r\nbe achieved by my gallant soldiers.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Alikhel, Captain Conolly handed to me the Amir's\r\nletters,[11] to which I replied at once, and the next day, under\r\ninstructions from the Government of India, I wrote to His Highness\r\nthat, in conformity with his own special request that an English\r\nofficer should be deputed as Envoy to his Court, and on condition that\r\nhe would himself be responsible for the protection and honourable\r\ntreatment of such an Envoy, Major Cavagnari and three British officers\r\nhad been allowed to go to Kabul, all of whom within six weeks had been\r\nruthlessly murdered by his troops and subjects; that his inability to\r\ncarry out the treaty engagements, and his powerlessness to establish\r\nhis authority, even in his own capital, having thus become apparent,\r\nan English army would now advance on Kabul with the double object of\r\nconsolidating his Government, should he himself loyally do his best to\r\nfulfil the terms of the treaty, and of exacting retribution from the\r\nmurderers of the British Mission. But that, although His Highness laid\r\ngreat stress in his letter of the 4th September on the sincerity of\r\nhis friendship, my Government had been informed that emissaries had\r\nbeen despatched from Kabul to rouse the country people and tribes\r\nagainst us, and as this action appeared inconsistent with friendly\r\nintentions, I considered it necessary for His Highness to send a\r\nconfidential representative to confer with me and explain his object.\r\n\r\nI had little doubt as to the truth of the report that the Amir was\r\nusing every effort to incite the Ghilzais and other tribes to oppose\r\nus, and I was confirmed in my conviction by a Native gentleman, Nawab\r\nGhulam Hussein Khan,[12] at one time our agent at Kabul, who told me\r\nthat, although he did not believe that Yakub Khan had actually planned\r\nthe massacre of the Embassy, he had certainly taken no steps to\r\nprevent it, and that he, Ghulam Hussein Khan, was convinced that the\r\nAmir was now playing us false. It was, therefore, a relief to\r\nfind awaiting me at Alikhel several of the leading men from the\r\nneighbouring districts, to whom I had telegraphed, before leaving\r\nSimla, asking them to meet me.\r\n\r\nThese men were profuse in their proffers of assistance, and, although\r\nI did not place a great deal of faith in their promises, I came to the\r\nconclusion that, notwithstanding Yakub Khan's treacherous efforts to\r\nstir up the tribes, if I could only push on rapidly with a fairly\r\nstrong force, I need not anticipate any opposition that I could not\r\novercome. Everything depended on speed, but rapidity of movement\r\ndepended on the condition of the transport service, and my inspection\r\nof the animals, as I passed through Kuram, was not calculated to\r\nraise hopes of being able to make a very quick advance; for, owing\r\nto continuous hard work and the want of a staff of trained transport\r\nattendants, the numbers of animals had steadily diminished, and those\r\nthat remained were for the most part sickly and out of condition.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of September I issued a Proclamation,[13] copies of which\r\nI caused to be sent to the people of Kabul, Ghazni, and all the\r\nneighbouring tribes; this, I hoped, would facilitate our advance, and\r\nreassure those who had taken no part in the attack on the Residency.\r\nI also wrote a letter[14] to the _maliks_ of the Logar valley, whose\r\nterritory we must enter directly we had crossed the Shutargardan, and\r\nwhose co-operation I was most anxious to obtain. On the 18th I again\r\nwrote[15] to the Amir, enclosing copies of these two documents, and\r\ninforming him that I was still awaiting a reply to my first letter\r\nand the arrival of His Highness's confidential representative; that I\r\nhoped he would soon issue the necessary orders for the furtherance of\r\nour plans and that he might rest assured of the support of the British\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th September matters had so far progressed that I was able to\r\ntell the Viceroy that Brigadier-General Baker was entrenched with his\r\nbrigade on the Shutargardan, and engaged in improving the road to\r\nKushi, the first halting-place in the Logar valley; that supplies were\r\nbeing collected by means of local transport; that I was bringing up\r\nreserve ammunition and treasure from the rear on Artillery waggons;\r\nand that every possible effort was being made to render the force\r\nmobile.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th I received the Amir's reply. He expressed regret that\r\nhe was unable to come to Alikhel himself, but intimated that he was\r\nsending two confidential agents, his Mustaufi (Finance Minister),\r\nHabibulla Khan, and his Wazir (Prime Minister), Shah Mahomed Khan, who\r\naccordingly arrived the next day.\r\n\r\nAt each interview I had with these gentlemen during the three days\r\nthey remained in my camp, they impressed upon me that the Amir was\r\ninclined to be most friendly, and that his only wish was to be guided\r\nby the advice of the British Government. But, notwithstanding these\r\nplausible assurances, I soon discovered that Yakub Khan's real object\r\nin sending these two high officials was to stop the advance of the\r\nforce, and induce me to leave the punishment of the troops who had\r\ncommitted the massacre in the hands of the Afghan authorities, or else\r\nto delay us long enough to give time for the whole country to rise\r\nagainst us.\r\n\r\nAs the conversations which were carried on at the meetings with the\r\nAfghan agents are interesting, and have an important bearing on the\r\nsubsequent proceedings, I give in the Appendix* the notes taken at the\r\ntime by my Political Secretary.\r\n\r\n(*Appendix V.)\r\n\r\nI was anxious to keep one of the Amir's representatives with me, but\r\nneither of them was willing to remain, so I felt bound to let them\r\nboth depart, taking with them the following letter to the Amir:\r\n\r\n  TO HIS HIGHNESS THE AMIR OF KABUL.\r\n\r\n    _Camp, Alikhel, 25th September, 1879._\r\n\r\n    (After compliments.) I have received Your Highness's two letters\r\n    of the 19th and 20th September (1st and 2nd Shawal), delivered\r\n    to me by the hands of Your Highness's two confidential\r\n    representatives, Mustaufi Habibulla Khan and Wazir Shah Mahomed.\r\n\r\n    I am much obliged to Your Highness for sending me two such\r\n    well-known men, and of such character as the Mustaufi and the\r\n    Wazir. They have informed me of Your Highness's wishes, and I\r\n    quite understand all they have told me. It is unfortunate that the\r\n    season is so late, and that winter will soon be here; but there is\r\n    yet time for a British army to reach Kabul before the great cold\r\n    sets in.\r\n\r\n    The Viceroy of India is much concerned that there should have been\r\n    any delay in promptly acceding to Your Highness's request for\r\n    advice and assistance, as conveyed in Your Highness's letters of\r\n    the 3rd and 4th instant. It was His Excellency's earnest wish\r\n    that troops should march on Kabul at once, so as to ensure Your\r\n    Highness's personal safety and aid Your Highness in restoring\r\n    peace and order at your capital.\r\n\r\n    Unfortunately, the want of transport, and the necessity for\r\n    collecting a certain amount of supplies, have caused a few weeks'\r\n    delay; it is, however, a source of gratification and happiness to\r\n    the Viceroy to learn that Your Highness's safety is not at present\r\n    endangered, and His Excellency trusts Your Highness will be able\r\n    to keep everything quiet in your kingdom, until such time as\r\n    British troops may reach Kabul.\r\n\r\n    I am glad to be able to inform Your Highness that news reached me\r\n    yesterday of the departure of a considerable force from Kandahar\r\n    under the command of a brave and distinguished officer, and that\r\n    a large body of troops, under command of General Bright, were\r\n    advancing rapidly from Peshawar to Jalalabad and onwards _viâ_\r\n    Gandamak to Kabul. My own force will, I hope, be in a state to\r\n    march before long. As Your Highness is aware, the Shutargardan has\r\n    been occupied for some days. Meanwhile regiments of Cavalry and\r\n    Infantry and batteries of Artillery have reached Kuram to replace\r\n    those I am taking on with me, and to reinforce my own column\r\n    should a necessity for more troops arise--a contingency I do not\r\n    in the least expect.\r\n\r\n    The Viceroy of India, in His Excellency's anxiety for Your\r\n    Highness's welfare and safety, issued orders that each of the\r\n    three armies, now advancing from Kandahar, Kuram, and the Khyber,\r\n    should be strong enough to overcome any opposition Your Highness's\r\n    enemies could possibly offer. That each is strong enough there can\r\n    be no doubt.\r\n\r\n    I understand that there is no one at Kelat-i-Ghilzai or Ghazni to\r\n    stop the progress of the troops _en route_ from Kandahar. There is\r\n    no reason, therefore, why they should not reach Kabul in a very\r\n    short time.\r\n\r\n    The Khyber tribes, having understood and appreciated the Treaty\r\n    of peace made by Your Highness with the British Government in May\r\n    last, have unanimously agreed to assist the troops from Peshawar\r\n    in every way, and are now eager to keep the road through the\r\n    Khyber safe, and to place all their transport animals at the\r\n    disposal of the British Commander, who will thus be enabled to\r\n    concentrate his force rapidly at Kabul. Through the kindness of\r\n    Your Highness I have experienced much less difficulty than I could\r\n    have expected, and I may now reasonably hope to be with Your\r\n    Highness at least as soon as either the Kandahar or Khyber column.\r\n    I look forward with great pleasure to the meeting with Your\r\n    Highness, and trust that you will continue your kind assistance to\r\n    obtain for me supplies and transport.\r\n\r\n    I have carefully considered Your Highness's proposal that you\r\n    yourself should be permitted to administer just punishment to the\r\n    mutinous troops and others who shared in the treacherous and cruel\r\n    attack on the British Envoy and his small escort, and thus save\r\n    Her Majesty's troops the trouble, hardship, and privation which\r\n    must necessarily be encountered by an advance on Kabul at this\r\n    season of the year. I thank Your Highness most cordially, on the\r\n    part of the Viceroy and Government of India, for this further\r\n    proof of Your Highness's friendly feelings. Under ordinary\r\n    circumstances such an offer would be gratefully and willingly\r\n    accepted, but after what has recently occurred, I feel sure that\r\n    the great British nation would not rest satisfied unless a British\r\n    army marched to Kabul and there assisted Your Highness to inflict\r\n    such punishments as so terrible and dastardly an act deserves.\r\n\r\n    I have forwarded Your Highness's letters in original to the\r\n    Viceroy; a copy of this, my reply, will be submitted by to-day's\r\n    post for His Excellency's consideration. Meanwhile I have\r\n    permitted Mustaufi Habibulla Khan and Wazir Shah Mahomed to take\r\n    their leave and rejoin Your Highness.\r\n\r\nI delayed my own departure from Alikhel until a sufficiency of\r\nsupplies had been collected at Kushi, and everything was ready for as\r\nrapid an advance on Kabul as my limited transport would admit of; for,\r\nso long as I remained behind, the people of Afghanistan could not\r\nbe sure of my intentions, and no doubt hoped that the Amir's\r\nremonstrances would have the desired effect, and prevent our doing\r\nmore than occupying the Shutargardan, or making a demonstration toward\r\nKushi. My crossing the pass would, I knew, be the signal for all those\r\ndetermined on opposition to assemble; it was politic, therefore, to\r\nremain behind until the last moment.\r\n\r\nWhen all arrangements were complete, so far as was possible with the\r\nmeans at my disposal, I issued the following Field Force Order:\r\n\r\n    'The Government of India having decided that a force shall proceed\r\n    with all possible despatch to Kabul, in response to His Highness\r\n    the Amir's appeal for aid, and with the object of avenging the\r\n    dastardly murder of the British representative and his escort, Sir\r\n    Frederick Roberts feels sure that the troops under his command\r\n    will respond to the call with a determination to prove themselves\r\n    worthy of the high reputation they have maintained during the\r\n    recent campaign.\r\n\r\n    'The Major-General need address no words of exhortation to\r\n    soldiers whose courage and fortitude have been so well proved. The\r\n    Afghan tribes are numerous, but without organization; the regular\r\n    army is undisciplined, and whatever may be the disparity in\r\n    numbers, such foes can never be formidable to British troops. The\r\n    dictates of humanity require that a distinction should be\r\n    made between the peaceable inhabitants of Afghanistan and the\r\n    treacherous murderers for whom a just retribution is in store,\r\n    and Sir Frederick Roberts desires to impress upon all ranks the\r\n    necessity for treating the unoffending population with justice,\r\n    forbearance, and clemency.\r\n\r\n    'The future comfort and well-being of the force depend largely on\r\n    the friendliness of our relations with the districts from which\r\n    supplies must be drawn; prompt payment is enjoined for all\r\n    articles purchased by departments and individuals, and all\r\n    disputes must be at once referred to a political officer for\r\n    decision.\r\n\r\n    'The Major-General confidently looks forward to the successful\r\n    accomplishment of the object of the expedition, and the\r\n    establishment of order and a settled Government in Afghanistan.'\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There are no such things as bells or knockers in India.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: 'Lose no time and spare no money to obtain reliable\r\ninformation of what is going on in Kabul, and keep me constantly\r\ninformed by urgent telegrams. I am in hopes that Jelaladin's report\r\nwill turn out to be greatly exaggerated, if not untrue.

From this, the\r\n    lack of power of the Amir and the weakness of his authority in his\r\n    capital itself are quite apparent and manifest. For this reason\r\n    the British troops are advancing for the purpose of taking a\r\n    public vengeance on behalf of the deceased as well as of obtaining\r\n    satisfaction (_lit._, consolidation) of the terms entered into in\r\n    the Treaty concluded. The British troops are entering Afghanistan\r\n    for the purpose of strengthening the royal authority of His\r\n    Highness the Amir on condition that His Highness loyally uses\r\n    those powers for the maintenance of friendship and of amicable\r\n    relations with the British Government. This is the only course by\r\n    which the Amir's kingdom can remain intact, and (by which) also\r\n    the friendly sentiments and sincerity expressed in his letter of\r\n    the 4th September, 1879, after the occurrence of the (said) event\r\n    can be proved.\r\n\r\n    For the purpose of removing any doubt about the concord of the two\r\n    Governments, the Amir has been addressed to depute a confidential\r\n    agent to my camp. The British force will not punish or injure\r\n    anyone except the persons who have taken part or joined in the\r\n    massacre of the Embassy unless they offer opposition. All the\r\n    rest, the small and great, who are unconcerned (therein) may rest\r\n    assured of this. Carriage and supplies of every description should\r\n    be brought into the British camp. Full price and hire shall be\r\n    paid for everything that may be taken. Whereas mercy and\r\n    humanity are the characteristics of this great Government, this\r\n    proclamation is issued beforehand for the information of the\r\n    people at large.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: TRANSLATION OF A LETTER FROM MAJOR-GENERAL SIR FREDERICK\r\nROBERTS TO CERTAIN _maliks_ OF THE LOGAR VALLEY.\r\n\r\n    From the Proclamation already issued by me, you will have learnt\r\n    the reasons for the march of the British troops to Kabul.

Gordon, and set out for Kushi, where Baker was\r\nnow encamped.\r\n\r\nJust before I started I had the pleasure of welcoming my old friend\r\nand brother officer, Major-General J. Hills, V.C., C.B., who had\r\nbeen with Sir Donald Stewart as Assistant Adjutant-General from the\r\nbeginning of the campaign, and who had, the moment he heard there was\r\nto be an advance on Kabul, come with all speed to place his services\r\nat my disposal. Although I had no employment for Hills at the time,\r\nthere would be plenty for all to do at Kabul, and I was delighted to\r\nhave so good a soldier with me.\r\n\r\nMy escort consisted of the Head-Quarters of the Cavalry brigade, one\r\nsquadron 9th Lancers, 5th Punjab Cavalry, and detachments of the 5th\r\nand 28th Punjab Infantry. We had only gone about halfway through the\r\npass when I pushed on with the Cavalry, in the hope of reaching the\r\ncamp on the top before dark, and was very soon met by twenty-five men\r\nof the 92nd Highlanders, who brought me a note from Colonel Perkins,\r\nR.E., in command on the Shutargardan, warning me that we were sure to\r\nbe attacked. We had not proceeded far, when at the narrowest part of\r\nthe defile we found the passage blocked by some 2,000 Afghans, and as\r\nwe approached a volley was fired from a party concealed by some rocks\r\non our left. I was told afterwards that it was intended for me, but I\r\nremained unscathed, and the principal medical officer, Dr. Townsend,\r\nwho was riding on my right, and to whom I was talking at the moment,\r\nwas severely wounded. The Highlanders, supported by some dismounted\r\nCavalry, cleared away the enemy to the north, but as they clung to the\r\nprecipitous hills on the south, we had to wait till the main body of\r\nthe escort came up, when they were speedily dispersed.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a sharp little engagement had taken place further up the\r\ngorge, and as we advanced we could see the enemy retiring before a\r\ndetachment of the 92nd Highlanders, under Colour-Sergeant Hector\r\nMacdonald, and of the 3rd Sikhs, under Jemadar Sher Mahomed, a Native\r\nof Kabul. The manner in which the Colour-Sergeant and the Native\r\nofficer handled their men gave me a high opinion of them both.[1]\r\n\r\nOn the top of the Shutargardan Pass that evening I received the Amir's\r\nreply[2] to my last letter, in which he expressed his gratitude for\r\nthe sympathy and support afforded him by the British Government, and\r\ninformed me that he had given orders to the Governor of Jalalabad that\r\nthe Khyber column should not meet with any opposition. I was also\r\ngiven a letter from Sirdar Wali Mahomed Khan, and several other\r\nSirdars, professing loyalty to the British Government, and expressing\r\npleasure at my approach. And at the same time the rather embarrassing\r\ninformation reached me that the Amir, desiring personal communication\r\nwith me, had already arrived in Baker's camp at Kushi, attended by his\r\nson Musa Khan, a lad about seven years old, his father-in-law, and the\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Afghan army (Daud Shah), with a suite of 45\r\nmembers and an escort of 200 men.\r\n\r\nAlthough I had met with but slight opposition hitherto, it was evident\r\nfrom the secret information I received that the Ghilzais were inclined\r\nto be hostile, and intended to oppose us, and as it was important to\r\nkeep open communication with Alikhel through their country, I arranged\r\nfor the Shutargardan to be held by a Mountain battery, the 3rd Sikhs,\r\nand the 21st Punjab Infantry, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nG.N. Money, an officer on whose judgment and coolness I knew I could\r\nrely.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I rode to Kushi, where my first interview with the\r\nAmir of Afghanistan took place.\r\n\r\nI cannot say that I was favourably impressed by his appearance. He was\r\nan insignificant-looking man, about thirty-two years of age, with a\r\nreceding forehead, a conical-shaped head, and no chin to speak of,\r\nand he gave me the idea of being entirely wanting in that force of\r\ncharacter without which no one could hope to govern or hold in check\r\nthe warlike and turbulent people of Afghanistan. He was possessed,\r\nmoreover, of a very shifty eye, he could not look one straight in the\r\nface, and from the first I felt that his appearance tallied exactly\r\nwith the double-dealing that had been imputed to him. His presence in\r\nmy camp was a source of the gravest anxiety to me. He was constantly\r\nreceiving and sending messages, and was no doubt giving his friends\r\nat Kabul all the information he could collect as to our resources and\r\nintentions. He had, however, come ostensibly as our ally, seeking\r\nrefuge from his mutinous soldiers, and whatever suspicions I might\r\nsecretly entertain, I could only treat him as an honoured guest, so\r\nlong as there was nothing proved against him.\r\n\r\nMy first visit to Yakub Khan was of a formal character. Nevertheless,\r\nhe seized the opportunity to urge strongly upon me the advisability\r\nof delaying my advance, that he might have time, he said, to restore\r\norder amongst his troops, and to punish those who had participated in\r\nthe attack on the Embassy. I replied that my orders were peremptory,\r\nand that it was my duty, as it was my determination, to press on to\r\nKabul with all possible speed. Finding that his arguments had no\r\neffect, he changed his tactics, and declared that he was much alarmed\r\nfor the safety of his family, whom he had left in the Bala Hissar;\r\nthat he had only one regiment on which he could depend; that he feared\r\nwhen the others should hear of our approach they would break out\r\nand attack the citadel; and that the innocent people in Kabul, not\r\nconsidering it possible that a British force could get there so\r\nquickly, had made no arrangements to convey their families away.\r\n\r\nFeeling that anxiety for the safety of the families was not the true\r\ncause for the Amir's efforts to delay us, and that his sole object\r\nwas to gain time for the development of plans for opposing our\r\nadvance--which subsequent events proved had been made with great\r\ncare--I told him it was impossible to accede to his wishes, but that\r\ntime would be given for all women and children to clear out of the\r\ncity if it should prove necessary to attack it. This necessity,\r\nhowever, I was most anxious to avoid, and earnestly hoped that\r\nour fighting would be over before we entered Kabul, for I had not\r\nforgotten Delhi, and I dreaded the idea of the troops having to force\r\ntheir way through narrow streets and crowded bazaars.\r\n\r\nYakub Khan was evidently much chagrined at my decision. He had left\r\nKabul hurriedly, his movements probably being hastened by hearing that\r\nhis uncle, Wali Mahomed Khan, and several other Sirdars with whom he\r\nwas at enmity, were on their way to join me. He had not even brought\r\na tent with him, and, had he succeeded in inducing me to delay our\r\nadvance, he would without doubt have returned to Kabul at once. As it\r\nwas, he was accommodated with a tent in the centre of the camp, and\r\nthe best arrangements possible, under the circumstances, made for his\r\nentertainment.\r\n\r\nWhen his own tents arrived, he asked leave to have them pitched\r\noutside camp limits. To this I consented, at the same time ordering\r\nthat a guard of the same strength as my own should be detailed as his\r\nescort, ostensibly to do him honour, but in reality that I might\r\nbe kept informed as to his movements. Unwelcome guest as he was, I\r\nthought the least of two evils was to keep him now that we had got\r\nhim, as his presence in Kabul would be sure to increase the opposition\r\nI felt certain we should encounter.\r\n\r\nIn response to the fears expressed by the Amir as to the safety of the\r\nnon-combatants, I issued the following Proclamation to the people of\r\nKabul:\r\n\r\n    'Be it known to all that the British Army is advancing on Kabul to\r\n    take possession of the city. If it be allowed to do so peacefully,\r\n    well and good; if not, the city will be seized by force.\r\n    Therefore, all well-disposed persons, who have taken no part in\r\n    the dastardly murder of the British Envoy, or in the plunder of\r\n    the Residency, are warned that, if they are unable to prevent\r\n    resistance being offered to the entrance of the British army, and\r\n    the authority of His Highness the Amir, they should make immediate\r\n    arrangements for their own safety, either by coming to the British\r\n    camp, or by such other measures as may seem fit to them. And as\r\n    the British Government does not make war on women and children,\r\n    warning is given that all women and children should be removed\r\n    from the city beyond the reach of harm. The British Government\r\n    desires to treat all classes with justice, and to respect their\r\n    religion, feelings, and customs, while exacting full retribution\r\n    from offenders. Every effort will, therefore, be made to prevent\r\n    the innocent suffering with the guilty, but it is necessary that\r\n    the utmost precaution should be taken against useless opposition.\r\n\r\n    'After receipt of this Proclamation, therefore, all persons found\r\n    armed in or about Kabul will be treated as enemies of the British\r\n    Government; and, further, it must be distinctly understood that,\r\n    if the entry of the British force is resisted, I cannot hold\r\n    myself responsible for any accidental injury which may be done to\r\n    the persons or property of even well-disposed people, who may have\r\n    neglected this warning.'\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the matter having been brought to my notice by Lord\r\nLytton, and bearing in my mind that my father had told me one of\r\nthe chief causes of the outbreak in Kabul in 1841 was the Afghans'\r\njealousy of their women, and resentment at the European soldiers'\r\nintimacy with them, I thought it well to impress upon all the\r\nnecessity for caution in this respect by publishing the following\r\nOrder:\r\n\r\n    'Sir Frederick Roberts desires General officers, and officers\r\n    commanding corps, to impress upon all officers under their command\r\n    the necessity for constant vigilance in preventing irregularities\r\n    likely to arouse the personal jealousies of the people of Kabul,\r\n    who are, of all races, most susceptible as regards their women.\r\n\r\n    'The deep-seated animosity of the Afghans towards the English has\r\n    been mainly ascribed to indiscretions committed during the first\r\n    occupation of Kabul, and the Major-General trusts that the same\r\n    excellent discipline so long exhibited by the troops under his\r\n    command will remove the prejudices of past years, and cause the\r\n    British name to be as highly respected in Afghanistan as it is\r\n    throughout the civilized world.[3]\r\n\r\nOn the 30th September (my forty-seventh birthday), all arrangements\r\nwhich it was possible for me to make having been completed, the\r\nCavalry brigade marched eight miles to Zargunshahr, the first\r\nhalting-place on the way to Kabul. I accompanied it, for I was\r\ninformed that Wali Mahomed Khan and the Sirdars had arrived so far,\r\nand I could not let them come on to my camp so long as the Amir was\r\nstill in it. I wished, also, to interview the Logar _maliks_ and\r\nascertain whether I could procure supplies from their valley. There\r\nwas bread-stuff with the force sufficient for fourteen days, but for\r\nthe transport of so much grain a large number of animals was required,\r\nwhich could ill be spared, for carriage was so short that I could only\r\nmove a little more than half the troops at one time, and instead of\r\nbeing able to march direct on Kabul with 6,000 men, a halt would have\r\nto be made every other day to admit of the animals going back to bring\r\nup the rear brigade, which practically meant my only having at my\r\ndisposal rather more than half that number at any one time. How\r\nfervently I wished that those in authority, who never can see the\r\nnecessity for maintaining transport in time of peace, could be made to\r\nrealize the result of their short-sightedness--the danger of having to\r\ndivide a none too large force in an enemy's country, the consequent\r\nrisk of failure, the enormous increase of anxiety to the Commander,\r\nthe delay in achieving the object of the campaign, and the additional\r\nlabour to all concerned in an undertaking, arduous enough under the\r\nmost favourable circumstances, in a difficult country, and under\r\na burning eastern sun, even if possessed of good and sufficient\r\ntransport.\r\n\r\nStores had been collected at Kushi partly by means of local carriage,\r\nand partly by our own animals doing the journey twice over from\r\nAlikhel, a distance of thirty-six miles. So hard pressed was I for\r\ntransport that I had to make the Cavalry soldiers march on foot and\r\nlead their horses laden with grain--an unusual piece of duty, which\r\nwas, however, performed with the cheerful alacrity which the troops of\r\nthe Kabul Field Force always displayed.\r\n\r\nBut all this is a digression. To return to my story. The _maliks_\r\nof Logar, greatly to my relief, agreed to bring a certain amount of\r\nsupplies; while Wali Mahomed Khan and the other Sirdars were full of\r\nprotestations of loyalty and devotion. Most of them remained with me\r\nall the time I was in Kabul, and some of them afforded me considerable\r\nassistance. The Sirdars warned me to place no trust in the Amir, and\r\nenlarged on the treachery of his conduct, but as I knew they looked\r\nupon Yakub Khan as their own deadly enemy, I accepted their counsel\r\nwith some reservation. I was not, however, able to feel quite at ease\r\nabout the proceedings of my Royal guest, so I returned to Kushi that\r\nsame evening.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st October the whole of the Kabul Field Force was assembled in\r\nthe Logar valley.[4]\r\n\r\nI waited at Kushi with the last of the Infantry until the morning of\r\nthe 2nd. Just as I was leaving camp, I became aware that firing was\r\ngoing on in the direction of the Shutargardan, and later in the day I\r\nreceived a report from Colonel Money as to what had happened there.\r\n\r\nThe enemy, emboldened by the diminished numbers of the garrison, and\r\nundervaluing what might be accomplished by a small number of good\r\nsoldiers, had assembled in force, and occupied the crest of the\r\nmountain, the only place from which heliographic communication with me\r\ncould be kept up. Money very properly decided that this could not be\r\npermitted, and considered it best to take the initiative before the\r\nenemy should become still stronger, so ordered an advance. Under cover\r\nof the Mountain battery's fire, Major Griffiths, of the 3rd Sikhs,\r\nwith 200 of his own men and 50 of the 21st Punjab Infantry, supported\r\nby 150 rifles of the latter corps, stormed the Afghans' position.\r\nThe assault, delivered in a most spirited manner, was perfectly\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nMajor Griffiths, however, was wounded, also a signalling sergeant of\r\nthe 67th Foot and five men of the 3rd Sikhs, while the enemy left\r\nthirty dead on the ground, and were pursued down the slope of the hill\r\nwithout making any attempt to rally.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd we marched fifteen miles to Zahidabad, where we first came\r\nin sight of the fortified hill above Kabul. The rear guard was fired\r\ninto on the way, and we had considerable difficulty in crossing\r\nthe Logar river, as the water from a large irrigation cut had been\r\ndirected back into the stream just above the ford. Our only casualty\r\non this day was Captain 'Dick' Kennedy, who was wounded in the hand.\r\n\r\nIt was plain from these occurrences, and from the attack on the\r\nShutargardan, that the people generally were not disposed to be\r\nfriendly. From the Amir I could extract no information on this head,\r\nalthough he must have been fully aware of the feelings and intentions\r\nof his subjects. He was in constant communication with Kabul, and was\r\nfrequently being met by mounted messengers, who, from the haste with\r\nwhich they travelled, as evidenced by the exhausted state of their\r\nhorses and the eagerness with which the Amir read the letters they\r\nbrought, appeared to be the bearers of important tidings.\r\n\r\nIt may be imagined how irritating and embarrassing was Yakub Khan's\r\npresence, since his position in my camp enabled him to give the\r\nleaders at Kabul accurate information as to our numbers and movements.\r\nThat he felt pretty sure of our discomfiture was apparent from his\r\nchange of manner, which, from being at first a mixture of extreme\r\ncordiality and cringing servility, became as we neared Kabul distant,\r\nand even haughty.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th October, one month from the receipt at Simla of the evil\r\ntidings of the fate of the British Embassy, we reached the pretty\r\nlittle village of Charasia, nestling in orchards and gardens, with a\r\nrugged range of hills towering above it about a mile away. This range\r\ndescended abruptly on the right to permit the exit of the Logar river,\r\nand rose again on its other side in precipitous cliffs, forming a fine\r\ngorge[5] about halfway between our camp and Kabul city, now only from\r\nten to twelve miles distant.\r\n\r\nAn uncle of the Amir (Sirdar Nek Mahomed Khan), and a General in the\r\nAfghan army, came out to meet Yakub Khan at this place; he remained\r\nsome time in earnest conversation with his nephew, and, as he was\r\nabout to remount his horse, called out in so loud a tone that it was\r\nevidently meant for us all to hear, that he was 'now going to disperse\r\nthe troops.'[6] Very different, however, was the story brought to me\r\nby an escaped Native servant of Cavagnari's, who came into our camp\r\nlater in the day. This man declared that preparations for fighting\r\nwere steadily being carried on; that the soldiers and townspeople were\r\nstreaming into the arsenal and supplying themselves with cartridges;\r\nthat large bodies of troops were moving out in our direction; and\r\nthat, when we advanced next day, we should certainly be opposed by a\r\nformidable force. The Amir, on having this intelligence communicated\r\nto him, pretended to disbelieve it utterly, and assured me that all\r\nwas at peace in the city, that Nek Mahomed would keep the troops\r\nquiet, and that I should have no trouble; but I was not taken in by\r\nhis specious assurances.\r\n\r\nNow more than ever I felt the want of sufficient transport! Had it\r\nbeen possible to have the whole of my force with me, I should have\r\nadvanced at once, and have occupied that evening the range of hills I\r\nhave described; but Macpherson's brigade was still a march behind,\r\nand all I could do was, immediately on arrival, to send back every\r\navailable transport animal to bring it up. I pushed forward Cavalry\r\npatrols along the three roads leading to Kabul, and rode out myself to\r\nreconnoitre the position in front. It was sufficiently strong to make\r\nme wish I had a larger force. Towards evening groups of men appeared\r\non the skyline all round, giving unmistakable warning that the tribes\r\nwere gathering in large numbers.\r\n\r\nFrom the information brought me by the Cavalry, and from my own\r\nexamination of the ground, I decided to advance along the left bank of\r\nthe river: and to facilitate this movement I determined to seize the\r\nheights on either side of the gorge at daybreak, whether Macpherson's\r\nbrigade had arrived or not. That night strong piquets were thrown out\r\nround the camp, and Cavalry patrols were ordered to proceed at dawn to\r\nfeel for the enemy. _L'homme propose, mais Dieu dispose_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Macdonald, having subsequently further distinguished\r\nhimself, was given a commission, and is now commanding a regiment in\r\nthe Egyptian Army.

Your friendly letter has reached me just at\r\n    this moment, 8 p.m., the 10th Shawal (27th September), and opened\r\n    the doors of joy and happiness on the face of my heart marked\r\n    with affection. I feel perfectly certain and confident that the\r\n    movements of Her Imperial Majesty's victorious troops are merely\r\n    for the purpose of consolidating the foundation of my kingdom and\r\n    strengthening the basis of my government.\r\n\r\n    In truth, the sympathy of friends with friends is fitting and\r\n    proper, and the indulgence and kindness of a great Government to\r\n    a sincere and faithful friend are agreeable and pleasing. I am\r\n    exceedingly gratified with, and thankful to, the representatives\r\n    of the illustrious British Government for their expression of\r\n    sympathy and their support of my cause. Your friendly and wise\r\n    suggestion that none of the ignorant tribes of Afghanistan should\r\n    oppose the British troops, so that the officers of the British\r\n    Government should be the better able to support and protect me, is\r\n    very acceptable and reasonable. Before I received your letter,\r\n    I had sent orders repeatedly to the Governors of Jalalabad and\r\n    Lalpura not to let anyone oppose or resist the British troops,\r\n    and stringent orders have again been issued to the Governor of\r\n    Jalalabad to use his utmost endeavours and efforts in this\r\n    respect. The order in question to the address of the Governor of\r\n    Jalalabad will be shown you to-morrow, and sent by an express\r\n    courier.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: It was a matter of intense gratification to me that the\r\nwhole time we remained in Afghanistan, nearly two years, not a single\r\ncomplaint was made by an Afghan of any soldier in my force having\r\ninterfered with the women of the country.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The force was made up as follows:\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n|                           |British  |  Other Ranks.  |\r\n|                           |Officers.|----------------|\r\n|                           |         |British.|Native.|\r\n-------------------------------------------------------|\r\n|Divisional, Brigade,       |         |        |       |\r\n|and Departmental Staff     |   60    |        |       |\r\n|F/A, R.H.A.                |    7    |   118  |       |\r\n|G/3, R.A.                  |    7    |   137  |       |\r\n|No. 2 Mountain Battery     |    3    |        |  223  |\r\n|Two Gatling guns           |    1    |    34  |       |\r\n|9th Lancers (one squadron) |    4    |   118  |       |\r\n|5th Punjab Cavalry         |    7    |        |  325  |\r\n|12th Bengal Cavalry        |    6    |        |  328  |\r\n|14th Bengal Lancers        |    7    |        |  407  |\r\n|67th Foot                  |   18    |   686  |       |\r\n|72nd Highlanders           |   23    |   746  |       |\r\n|92nd Highlanders           |   17    |   717  |       |\r\n|5th Punjab Infantry        |    8    |        |  610  |\r\n|5th Gurkhas                |    7    |        |  574  |\r\n|23rd Pioneers              |    6    |        |  671  |\r\n|28th Punjab Infantry       |    8    |        |  636  |\r\n|7th Company Bengal Sappers |    3    |        |   93  |\r\n|          and Miners       ---------------------------|\r\n|                           |  192    | 2,558  |3,867  |\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Known as the _sang-i-nawishta_ (inscribed stone).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Shortly after I was settled at Kabul, the following\r\nletter, written by Nek Mahomed on the evening of the day he had been\r\nwith the Amir, to some person whom he wished to acquaint with the\r\nstate of affairs, was brought to me:\r\n\r\n    'MY KIND FRIEND,--The truth is that to-day, at sunrise, I went to\r\n    the camp, the Amir having summoned me. When I arrived, Mulla Shah\r\n    Mahomed [the Wazir] first said to me, \"Go back and tell the people\r\n    to raise a holy war.\" I did not feel certain about what he said\r\n    [or was not satisfied with this], [but] the Amir afterwards told\r\n    me to go back that very hour and rouse the people to a _ghaza_. I\r\n    got back to Kabul about 7 o'clock, and am collecting the people.\r\n    Salaam.'\r\n\r\nThe letter was not addressed, but it was sealed with Nek Mahomed's\r\nseal, and there was no reason to doubt its authenticity.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n1879\r\n\r\n  The Afghan position--The fight at Charasia\r\n  --Highlanders, Gurkhas, and Punjabis--Defeat of the Afghans\r\n  --Kabul in sight--Deh-i-Mazang gorge--The enemy give us the slip\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cavalry having reported that the road through the\r\n_sang-i-nawishta_ gorge was impassable, I started off a party[1]\r\nbefore it was fully light on the 6th, to work at it and make it\r\npracticable for guns. I was preparing to follow with an escort of\r\nCavalry to examine the pass and the ground beyond, when the growing\r\ndaylight discovered large numbers of Afghan troops in regular\r\nformation crowning the hills that I ought to have been in a position\r\nto occupy the preceding evening. No hurry, no confusion was apparent\r\nin their movements; positions were taken up and guns placed with such\r\ncoolness and deliberation that it was evident regularly trained troops\r\nwere employed. Very soon I received reports of our Cavalry patrols\r\nhaving been fired upon, and of their having been obliged to retire.\r\n\r\nImmediate action was imperatively necessary; the Afghans had to be\r\ndislodged from their strong position at any cost, or we should have\r\nbeen surrounded by overwhelming numbers. Their occupation of the\r\nheights was, I felt, a warning that must not be disregarded, and a\r\nmenace that could not be brooked.\r\n\r\nBehind this range of hills lay the densely-crowded city of Kabul,\r\nwith the scarcely less crowded suburbs of Chardeh, Deh-i-Afghan, and\r\nnumberless villages thickly studded over the Kabul valley, all of\r\nwhich were contributing their quota of warriors to assist the Regular\r\ntroops in disputing the advance of the British. It did not require\r\nmuch experience of Asiatics to understand that, if the enemy were\r\nallowed to remain undisturbed for a single night in the position they\r\nhad taken up, their numbers would increase to an extraordinary extent.\r\n\r\nI now received a report from the rear that the road was blocked, and\r\nthat the progress of Macpherson's brigade would certainly be opposed;\r\nwhile, on the crests of the hills to the right and left of my camp,\r\nbodies of men began to assemble, who, I surmised (which surmise I\r\nafterwards learnt was correct), were only waiting for the sun to go\r\ndown to make a general attack upon the camp under cover of dusk.\r\n\r\nThe situation was one of great anxiety. The whole force with me was\r\nnot more than 4,000 men and eighteen guns. The treacherous Amir and\r\nhis equally treacherous Ministers had, of course, kept the Afghan\r\nCommander fully informed as to the manner in which my troops were\r\nperforce divided; the position of every man and every gun with me was\r\nknown; and I feared that, as soon as we were engaged with the enemy,\r\nthe opportunity would be taken to attack my weakly-defended camp and\r\nto engage Macpherson's small brigade, encumbered as it was with its\r\nlarge convoy of stores and ammunition.\r\n\r\nThe numbers of the enemy were momentarily increasing, so delay would\r\nassuredly make matters worse; the only chance of success, therefore,\r\nwas to take the initiative, and attack the Afghan main position at\r\nonce. Accordingly, I sent an officer with orders to the troops who\r\nwere moving towards the gorge not to commence work, but to take up\r\na defensive position until my plans were further developed. I sent\r\nanother messenger to Macpherson, informing him of my intention to take\r\nimmediate action, and telling him to keep a good look-out, and push on\r\nto Charasia with all possible speed, and at the same time I reinforced\r\nhim by a squadron of Cavalry.\r\n\r\nThe Afghan position formed the arc of a circle, extending from the\r\n_sang-i-nawishta_ gorge to the heights above Chardeh. Both sides of\r\nthe gorge were occupied by the enemy, as was a semi-detached hill to\r\nthe south of it, and sixteen guns were observed in position. The line\r\nthey had taken up occupied nearly three miles of country; and their\r\nmain position was the ridge, which, close to the gorge, rose 1,000\r\nfeet above the plain, running up at its western extremity to a peak\r\n2,200 feet high. Thence the line stretched along the edge of some\r\nlower heights to a rugged hill, the summit of which was about 1,800\r\nfeet above Charasia. In front of this formidable position were a\r\nsuccession of sandy hills, forming a series of easily defensible\r\nposts, and at the foot of these hills ran a bare stony belt, sloping\r\ndown to the cultivated land surrounding Charasia and the hamlet of\r\nKhairabad.\r\n\r\nMy movements and reconnaissances up till now having led the enemy to\r\nbelieve that I intended to deliver my attack on their left at the\r\n_sang-i-nawishta_, they were seen to be concentrating their forces in\r\nthat direction. But this position could only have been carried with\r\nsuch damaging loss to us that I determined to make the real attack by\r\nan outflanking movement to their right.\r\n\r\nThe men having made a hasty breakfast, I despatched General Baker in\r\nthis direction, and placing at his disposal the troops noted below,[2]\r\nI entrusted to him the difficult task of dislodging the enemy, while\r\nI continued to distract their attention towards the gorge by making a\r\nfeint to their left.\r\n\r\nBaker's little column assembled in a wooded enclosure close to\r\nCharasia, where he left his field hospital and reserve ammunition, for\r\nthe safe guarding of which I sent him the 5th Punjab Infantry, while\r\nhe was further reinforced by 450 men of the 23rd Pioneers and three\r\nField Artillery guns. I was thus left with only six Horse Artillery\r\nguns, 450 Cavalry, and between 600 and 700 Infantry for the protection\r\nof the camp, where I was still handicapped by the presence of the Amir\r\nand his untrustworthy following.\r\n\r\nWhile Baker advanced to the left, the party near the _sang-i-nawishta_\r\ngorge, commanded by Major White, of the 92nd Highlanders, was ordered\r\nto threaten the pass and to prevent the enemy occupying any portion of\r\nthe Charasia village, to advance within Artillery range of the enemy's\r\nmain position above the gorge, and when the outflanking movement had\r\nbeen thoroughly developed and the enemy were in full retreat, but not\r\nbefore, to push the Cavalry through the gorge and pursue.\r\n\r\nAt about 11.30 a.m. Baker's leading troops emerged into the open, and\r\nwere immediately engaged with a crowd of armed Afghans, supported by a\r\nconsiderable body of Regular troops. The General now sent one company\r\nof the 72nd, under Captain Hunt, to turn the Afghans off a succession\r\nof peaks situated at right angles to the ridge they were occupying on\r\ntheir extreme right. Running along this ridge, and stretching across\r\nthe Indiki road to the sandhills, the Afghan right wing held a\r\nline considerably in advance of their left on the hill above the\r\n_sang-i-nawishta_ gorge, and one which could not easily be turned, for\r\nthe peaks the 72nd were sent to occupy were almost inaccessible, and\r\nthe fire from them swept the slopes up which our troops must advance.\r\nThese peaks, therefore, formed the key of the position, and their\r\ndefenders had to be dislodged from them at all hazards before anything\r\nelse could be attempted. The company of the 72nd with much difficulty\r\nfought their way up, and gained a footing on the first peak, where\r\nthey were obliged to pause, until reinforced by two companies of the\r\n5th Gurkhas under Captain Cook, V.C., when they advanced all together,\r\nclearing the enemy from each successive point, while the remainder of\r\nthe 72nd breasted the hill, and, under cover of the Mountain guns,\r\nattacked the position in front. But the enemy were obstinate, and the\r\nextremely difficult nature of the ground somewhat checked the gallant\r\nHighlanders. Seeing their dilemma, Baker despatched two companies of\r\nthe 5th Gurkhas, under Lieutenant-Colonel Fitz-Hugh, and 200 men of\r\nthe 5th Punjab Infantry, under Captain Hall, to their assistance;\r\nwhile the 23rd Pioneers were brought up on the right, in support, and\r\na detachment of the 5th Punjab Infantry echeloned in rear, on the left\r\nof the line.\r\n\r\nThe engagement now became hot, and the firing fast and furious.\r\nMy readers will, I am sure, be able to realize with what intense\r\nexcitement and anxiety I watched the proceedings. It was evident to\r\nme that little progress could be made so long as the enemy retained\r\npossession of the ridge, which the Afghan Commander apparently had\r\njust begun to appreciate was the real point of attack, for his troops\r\ncould now be seen hurrying to this point, and it became more urgently\r\nnecessary than ever to carry the position before it could be\r\nreinforced. At 2 p.m. it was seized; the Highlanders and Gurkhas could\r\nno longer be resisted; the Afghans wavered, and then began to retreat,\r\nexposed to a cross-fire that effectually prevented their rallying.\r\n\r\nThe brunt of this affair was borne by the 72nd, admirably led by their\r\ncompany officers, under the skilful direction of Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nClarke and his Adjutant, Lieutenant Murray. I closely watched\r\ntheir movements, and particularly observed one man pushing up the\r\nprecipitous hillside considerably in advance of everyone else, and\r\napparently utterly regardless of the shower of bullets falling round\r\nhim. I inquired about him later on, and found that he was a young\r\nIrish private of the 72nd, named MacMahon, to whose coolness and\r\ndaring was in a great measure due the capture of this very strong\r\npost. Her Majesty, I am glad to be able to relate, subsequently\r\nrewarded this intrepid soldier by bestowing on him the Victoria Cross.\r\n\r\nThe general advance was now sounded, and gallantly was it responded\r\nto. The main position was stormed by the Highlanders, Gurkhas, and\r\nPunjab Infantry, each trying hard to be the first to close with its\r\ndefenders. The enemy fought desperately, charging down on the Gurkhas,\r\nby whom, under the leadership of Lieutenant-Colonel Fitz-Hugh and his\r\nAdjutant, Lieutenant Martin, they were repulsed and driven over the\r\ncrest with heavy loss.\r\n\r\nThe Afghans now took up a position some 600 yards in the rear of that\r\nfrom which they had just been dislodged, where they made an obstinate\r\nstand for half an hour, but they were again forced back on the\r\nattacking party being strengthened by the arrival of two companies of\r\nthe 92nd Highlanders, sent to their assistance by Major White, who\r\nhad already successfully engaged the Afghan left above the\r\n_sang-i-nawishta_ gorge. As the enemy's advanced posts on the hill to\r\nthe south, and directly in front of the gorge, prevented our guns from\r\ncoming within range of their position on the heights above, these\r\nposts had to be disposed of as a preliminary to effective co-operation\r\nwith Baker; accordingly, about noon the hill was captured by two\r\ncompanies of the 92nd, under Captain Cotton, and half a battery of\r\nField Artillery was advanced to a point whence Major Parry was able to\r\nengage the Afghan guns posted above the gorge.\r\n\r\nIt was at this juncture, when Baker's troops, having carried the\r\nmain position, were proceeding to attack that to which the enemy had\r\nretreated, that White despatched two companies of the 92nd, under\r\nCaptain Oxley, by whose timely aid the determined foe were at length\r\ndriven from this point of vantage also. The troops followed up their\r\nsuccess and advanced at the double, while our guns shelled the shaken\r\nmasses.\r\n\r\nThe Afghan right and centre now gave way completely; the enemy broke,\r\nand fled down the slopes on the further side in a north-westerly\r\ndirection, eventually taking refuge in the Chardeh villages.\r\n\r\nBy 3.45 we were in possession of the whole of the main ridge. The\r\nfirst objective having been thus gained, the troops, pivoting on their\r\nright, brought round their left and advanced against the now exposed\r\nflanks of the enemy's left wing, and simultaneously with this movement\r\nWhite advanced from his position by the hill in front of the gorge,\r\nand a little after four o'clock had gained possession of the pass and\r\ntwelve Afghan guns.\r\n\r\nCompletely outflanked and enfiladed by Baker's fire, the left wing of\r\nthe Afghan force made but little resistance; they rapidly abandoned\r\nthe height, and retired across the river toward the north-east,\r\npursued by the small body of Cavalry attached to White's force, under\r\nMajor Hammond, and a party of the 92nd, under Major Hay.\r\n\r\nBaker now paused to allow of the Infantry's ammunition being\r\nreplenished, and then advanced along the ridge towards the pass, which\r\nhe reached in time to help the Cavalry who were engaged with the\r\nenemy's rear guard at the river; the latter were driven off and forced\r\nto retreat; but by this time the growing darkness made further pursuit\r\nimpossible. We were therefore compelled to rest satisfied with holding\r\nthe ground in advance by piquets and occupying both ends of the\r\n_sang-i-nawishta_ defile, where the troops bivouacked for the night. I\r\nwas able to supply them with food from Charasia, and they were made as\r\ncomfortable as they could be under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhile the fighting was taking place on the heights in front of\r\nCharasia, the hills on both flanks of my camp were crowded with the\r\nenemy, anxiously watching the result; they did not approach within the\r\nCavalry patrols, but one party caused so much annoyance to a picquet\r\nby firing into it that it became necessary to dislodge it, a service\r\nwhich was performed in a very daring manner by a few of the 92nd,\r\nunder Lieutenant Grant and Colour-Sergeant Hector Macdonald, the same\r\nnon-commissioned officer who had a few days before so distinguished\r\nhimself in the Hazardarakht defile.\r\n\r\nOur casualties were wonderfully few, only 18 killed and 70 wounded,[3]\r\nwhile the enemy left 300 dead behind them, and as they succeeded in\r\ncarrying numbers of their killed and wounded off the field, their loss\r\nmust have been heavy. I subsequently ascertained that we had opposed\r\nto us, besides thirteen Regular regiments, between eight and ten\r\nthousand Afghans. Ghilzais from Tezin and Hisarak had hurried up in\r\nlarge numbers to join the enemy, but, luckily for us, arrived too\r\nlate. Of these some returned to their homes when they found the Afghan\r\narmy had been beaten, but the greater number waited about Kabul to\r\nassist in any further stand that might be made by the Regular troops.\r\n\r\nThe heliograph, worked by Captain Stratton, of the 22nd Foot, had been\r\nof the greatest use during the day, and kept me fully informed of all\r\ndetails. The last message as the sun was sinking behind the hills,\r\nconfirming my own observations, was a most satisfactory one, to the\r\neffect that the whole of the enemy's position was in our possession,\r\nand that our victory was complete.\r\n\r\nThroughout the day my friend (!) the Amir, surrounded by his Sirdars,\r\nremained seated on a knoll in the centre of the camp watching the\r\nprogress of the fight with intense eagerness, and questioning everyone\r\nwho appeared as to his interpretation of what he had observed. So soon\r\nas I felt absolutely assured of our victory, I sent an Aide-de-camp to\r\nHis Highness to convey the joyful intelligence of our success. It was,\r\nwithout doubt, a trying moment for him, and a terrible disappointment\r\nafter the plans which I subsequently ascertained he and his adherents\r\nat Kabul had carefully laid for our annihilation. But he received\r\nthe news with Asiatic calmness, and without the smallest sign of\r\nmortification, merely requesting my Aide-de-camp to assure me that, as\r\nmy enemies were his enemies, he rejoiced at my victory.\r\n\r\nMacpherson's brigade, with its impedimenta, arrived before it was\r\nquite dark, so altogether I had reason to feel satisfied with the\r\nday's results. But the fact still remained that not more than twelve\r\nmiles beyond stood the city of Kabul, with its armed thousands ready\r\nto oppose us should an assault prove necessary. I had besides received\r\ninformation of a further gathering of Ghilzais bent upon another\r\nattack on the Shutargardan, and that reinforcements of Regular troops\r\nand guns were hastening to Kabul from Ghazni. Prompt action was the\r\none and only means of meeting these threatened difficulties. My troops\r\nhad had more than enough for one day, and required rest, but needs\r\nmust when the devil (in the shape of Afghan hordes) drives. I resolved\r\nto push on, and issued orders for tents to be struck at once and an\r\nadvance to be made at break of day.\r\n\r\nAt the first streak of dawn on the 7th I started, leaving Macpherson\r\nto come on with the heavy baggage as quickly as he could. I marched by\r\nthe _sang-i-nawishta_ defile, where Major White met me and explained\r\nto me his part in the victory of the previous day. From my inspection\r\nof the ground, I had no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that\r\nmuch of the success which attended the operations on this side was due\r\nto White's military instincts and, at one supreme moment, his extreme\r\npersonal gallantry. It afforded me, therefore, very great pleasure to\r\nrecommend this officer for the Victoria Cross, an honour of which\r\nmore than one incident in his subsequent career proved him to be well\r\nworthy.\r\n\r\nOur rapid advance, following on the defeat of the previous day, had\r\nthe effect I hoped it would have. On arriving at Beni Hissar, a\r\nconsiderable village, surrounded by orchards and gardens, only two\r\nmiles south of the far-famed citadel of the Bala Hissar, I sent out\r\nCavalry patrols to reconnoitre, who brought me the pleasing news that\r\nthe Bala Hissar had been evacuated, and the only part of the city\r\nvisible seemed to be deserted.\r\n\r\nDuring the day I received visits from some of the chief merchants of\r\nKabul, who each told a different tale regarding the movements of the\r\ndefeated Afghan army and the intentions of the Afghan Commander. From\r\ntheir conflicting accounts, however, I gathered that, fresh troops\r\nhaving arrived from Kohistan, the remnants of the Charasia army had\r\njoined them, and that the combined forces were then occupying\r\nthe range of hills immediately above Kabul, to the west, and had\r\ndetermined to make another stand.\r\n\r\nHaving received intelligence that the enemy, if again defeated,\r\nintended to retire towards Turkestan, I directed Brigadier-General\r\nMassy, on the morning of the 8th October, to move out with the Cavalry\r\nbrigade and place himself across their line of retreat.[4] The brigade\r\nstarted at 11 a.m., and, in order to avoid the city and adjacent\r\nheights, made a considerable detour by Siah Sang and Sherpur, the new\r\nAfghan cantonment. On reaching the latter place, Massy heliographed\r\nto me that he had found it deserted, the magazine blown up, and\r\nseventy-five guns[5] abandoned inside the enclosure, and that the\r\nenemy were now occupying a ridge[6] which seemed to him to be\r\na prolongation of the Shahr-i-Darwaza range above Kabul; then,\r\ncontinuing his march, he crossed a depression in this ridge called\r\nthe Nanachi Kotal, and wheeling to his left, and skirting the Asmai\r\nheights on the western side, he soon came in sight of the Afghan camp,\r\npitched on the slope of the hills about a mile from Deh-i-Mazang.\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General Massy was informed, in reply to his heliogram,\r\nthat Baker would be despatched at once to drive the enemy from their\r\nposition and force them to fall back upon the Cavalry, upon which\r\nMassy immediately made the arrangements which appeared to him most\r\nadvisable for blocking, with the limited number of sabres at his\r\ndisposal, the several roads by which the enemy might attempt to\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nI could only spare to Baker a very small force (1,044 rifles, two\r\nMountain guns and one Gatling), for Macpherson's and White's troops\r\nhad not yet come up. He started off without a moment's delay, and,\r\ndriving the enemy's scouts before him, worked his way along the\r\nShahr-i-Darwaza heights to the west; but his progress was very slow,\r\nowing to the extreme difficulty of the ground, and the day was far\r\nspent before he found himself near enough to the enemy to use his\r\nArtillery. To his delight, Baker perceived that he commanded the\r\nAfghan camp and the rear of their main position; but his satisfaction\r\nwas considerably allayed when he discovered that between him and them\r\nlay a deep gorge[7] with precipitous sides, through which ran the\r\nKabul river, and that before he could attack he would have to descend\r\n1,600 feet, and then climb up the opposite side, which was nearly as\r\nhigh and quite as steep.\r\n\r\nAnxious as Baker was that there should be no delay in delivering the\r\nassault, by the time his dispositions were made it had become too dark\r\nto attempt it, and most reluctantly he had to postpone the movement\r\ntill daybreak the next day. He had ascertained that the Kabul river\r\nwas not fordable for Infantry except at a point which was commanded\r\nby the enemy's camp, and was too far from support to warrant piquets\r\nbeing pushed across at night. Nothing whatever could be seen, but\r\na very slight noise as of stealthy movement in the Afghan camp was\r\nheard, and the fear seized Baker that the enemy might escape him. Soon\r\nafter 11 p.m., therefore, when the rising moon began in a measure\r\nto dispel the darkness, Baker sent a strong patrol under a British\r\nofficer to feel for the enemy. The patrol came into contact with the\r\nAfghan scouts on the river-bank, from some of whom, taken prisoners in\r\nthe struggle, they learned that the enemy had crept away under cover\r\nof the night, and the greater number had dispersed to their own homes;\r\nbut about 800, mounted on Artillery horses, were reported to have\r\naccompanied their Commander, Mahomed Jan, and to have escaped in the\r\ndirection of Bamian.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Brigadier-General Massy, from his point of observation\r\nbeneath the Asmai heights, had perceived that it was impossible for\r\nBaker to carry the enemy's main position by daylight; he tried\r\nto communicate with Baker and ascertain his plans, but the party\r\ndespatched on this service were unable to get through the villages and\r\nwoods, which were all held by the enemy, and returned unsuccessful.\r\nMassy then collected his scattered squadrons and bivouacked for the\r\nnight, being anxious that his men and horses should have food and\r\nrest, and it not having struck him that the enemy might attempt to\r\nescape during the hours of darkness.\r\n\r\nThe information that in very truth they had escaped was brought to\r\nBaker at 4.30 a.m. He at once communicated it to Massy, telling him\r\nat the same time that any movement the Cavalry might make in pursuit\r\nwould be supported by the troops under his immediate command, and\r\nalso by a brigade under Brigadier-General Macpherson, which I had\r\ndespatched to reinforce Baker; Macpherson and White, with their\r\nrespective troops, having arrived at Beni Hissar shortly after Baker\r\nhad started.\r\n\r\nI joined Baker at this time, and great was my disappointment at being\r\ntold that the Afghans had given us the slip. I went carefully over the\r\nground, however, and satisfied myself that Baker had done all that was\r\npossible under the circumstances, and that the enemy having eluded us\r\ncould not in any way be attributed to want of care or skill on his\r\npart.\r\n\r\nMassy scoured the country until nightfall on the 9th, but with very\r\nlittle success, only one small party of fugitives being overtaken\r\nabout four-and-twenty miles on the road to Ghazni. Numbers, doubtless,\r\nfound shelter in the city of Kabul, others in the numerous villages\r\nwith which the richly-cultivated Chardeh valley was thickly studded,\r\nand whose inhabitants were hostile to a man; others escaped to the\r\nhills; and the remainder, having had ten hours' start, could not be\r\novertaken.\r\n\r\nThe enemy's camp was left standing, and twelve guns, some elephants,\r\ncamels, mules, and ponies, fell into our possession.\r\n\r\nDuring that day our camp was moved nearer the city to Siah Sang, a\r\ncommanding plateau between the Kabul and Logar rivers, close to their\r\nconfluence, and less than a mile east of the Bala Hissar. The 5th\r\nGurkhas and two Mountain guns were left to hold the heights on which\r\nBrigadier-General Baker had been operating, and the rest of the force\r\nwas concentrated on Siah Sang.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Twenty sabres, 9th Lancers, one squadron 5th Punjab\r\nCavalry, two guns, No. 2 Mountain battery, 284 rifles, 92nd\r\nHighlanders, and 450 rifles, 23rd Pioneers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Two guns, No. 2 Mountain battery, two Gatling guns,\r\ndetachment 12th Bengal Cavalry, 72nd Highlanders, 5th Gurkhas (300\r\nrifles), 5th Punjab Infantry (200 rifles), No. 7 Company Sappers and\r\nMiners.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: During the fight the Infantry expended 41,090 rounds, of\r\nwhich over 20,000 were fired by the 72nd Highlanders.

No. 2 Mountain Battery fired 10 common shell\r\nand 94 shrapnel, total, 104 rounds. The two Gatlings fired 150 rounds.\r\n\r\nAt the tenth round one of the Gatlings jammed, and had to be taken to\r\npieces. This was the first occasion on which Gatling guns were used in\r\naction. They were not of the present improved make, and, being found\r\nunsatisfactory, were made but little use of.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The troops available for this purpose were: One squadron\r\n9th Lancers, 5th Punjab Cavalry, 12th Bengal Cavalry, and 14th Bengal\r\nLancers; total, 720 of all ranks.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The guns included four English 18-pounders, one English\r\n8-inch howitzer and two Afghan imitations of this weapon, and\r\nforty-two bronze Mountain guns.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The Asmai heights.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The Deh-i-Mazang gorge.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n1879\r\n\r\n  Guiding instructions--Visit to the Bala Hissar--Yakub Khan abdicates\r\n  --The Proclamation--Administrative measures\r\n  --Explosions in the Bala Hissar\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last I was at Kabul, the place I had heard so much of from my\r\nboy-hood, and had so often wished to see! The city lay beneath me,\r\nwith its mud-coloured buildings and its 50,000 inhabitants, covering\r\na considerable extent of ground. To the south-east corner of the city\r\nappeared the Bala Hissar, picturesquely perched on a saddle just\r\nbeneath the Shahr-i-Darwaza heights, along the top of which ran\r\na fortified wall, enclosing the upper portion of the citadel and\r\nextending to the Deh-i-Mazang gorge.\r\n\r\nKabul was reported to be perfectly quiet, and numbers of traders came\r\ninto our camp to dispose of their wares; but I forbade anyone to\r\nenter the city until I had been able to decide upon the best means of\r\nmaintaining order amongst a population for the most part extremely\r\nfanatical, treacherous, and vindictive.\r\n\r\nSo far our success had been complete: all opposition had been\r\novercome, Kabul was at our mercy, the Amir was in my camp ready to\r\nagree to whatever I might propose, and it had been all done with\r\nextraordinarily little loss to ourselves. Nevertheless, I felt my\r\ndifficulties were very far from being at an end--indeed, the part of\r\nmy duty still remaining to be accomplished was surrounded with far\r\ngreater difficulty, and was a source of much more anxiety to me than\r\nthe military task I had undertaken; for, with regard to the latter, I\r\npossessed confidence in myself and my ability to perform it, whereas,\r\nwith respect to the political and diplomatic side of the question,\r\nactual personal experience I had none, and I could only hope that\r\ncommon-sense and a sense of justice would carry me through.\r\n\r\nThe instructions I had received from the Government of India were very\r\ngeneral in their character, for the Viceroy felt that any proceedings\r\nmust necessarily depend on the state of affairs obtaining at Kabul,\r\nthe acts and attitude of the Amir and his people, and the various\r\nconditions impossible to foresee when the Foreign Office letter was\r\nwritten to me on the 29th September. But, though general, they were\r\nvery comprehensive.\r\n\r\nThe troops were to be placed in strong and secure positions, such as\r\nwould give me complete control over the Amir's capital; any Afghan\r\nsoldiers remaining at Kabul, and the whole of the city population,\r\nwere to be disarmed; supplies were to be collected in sufficient\r\nquantities to render my force independent in case of interruption\r\nalong the line of communication; Yakub Khan's personal safety was to\r\nbe secured, and adequate supervision maintained over his movements\r\nand actions; a close investigation was to be instituted into all the\r\ncauses and circumstances connected with the 'totally unprovoked and\r\nmost barbarous attack by the Amir's soldiery and the people of his\r\ncapital upon the representative of an allied State, who was residing\r\nunder the Amir's protection in the Amir's fortress, in very close\r\nproximity to the Amir himself, and whose personal safety and\r\nhonourable treatment had been solemnly guaranteed by the Ruler of\r\nAfghanistan.'\r\n\r\nThe retribution to be exacted was to be adapted to the twofold\r\ncharacter of the offence, and was to be imposed upon the Afghan nation\r\nin proportion as the offence was proved to be national, and as the\r\nresponsibility should be brought home to any particular community.\r\nFurther, the imposition of a fine, it was suggested upon the city of\r\nKabul 'would be in accordance with justice and precedent,' and the\r\ndemolition of fortifications and removal of buildings within range of\r\nmy defences, or which might interfere with my control over the city,\r\nmight be 'necessary as a military precaution.'\r\n\r\nIn forming my plans for the removal of obstructive buildings, I was to\r\nconsider 'whether they can be combined with any measures compatible\r\nwith justice and humanity for leaving a memorial of the retribution\r\nexacted from the city in some manner and by some mark that will not be\r\neasily obliterated.'\r\n\r\nI was told that 'in regard to the punishment of individuals, it should\r\nbe swift, stern, and impressive, without being indiscriminate or\r\nimmoderate; its infliction must not be delegated to subordinate\r\nofficers of minor responsibility acting independently of your\r\ninstructions or supervision; and you cannot too vigilantly maintain\r\nthe discipline of the troops under your orders, or superintend their\r\ntreatment of the unarmed population, so long as your orders are obeyed\r\nand your authority is unresisted. You will deal summarily in the\r\nmajority of cases with persons whose share in the murder of anyone\r\nbelonging to the British Embassy shall have been proved by your\r\ninvestigations, but while the execution of justice should be as public\r\nand striking as possible, it should be completed with all possible\r\nexpedition, since the indefinite prolongation of your proceedings\r\nmight spread abroad unfounded alarm.'\r\n\r\nThe despatch concluded with the words: 'It will probably be essential,\r\nnot only for the protection of your own camp from annoyance, but also\r\nfor the security of the well-affected population and for the general\r\nmaintenance of order, that you should assume and exercise supreme\r\nauthority in Kabul, since events have unfortunately proved that the\r\nAmir has lost that authority, or that he has conspicuously failed to\r\nmake use of it.'\r\n\r\nOn the 10th I visited Sherpur, and the next day I went to the Bala\r\nHissar, and wandered over the scene of the Embassy's brave defence\r\nand cruel end. The walls of the Residency, closely pitted with\r\nbullet-holes, gave proof of the determined nature of the attack\r\nand the length of the resistance. The floors were covered with\r\nblood-stains, and amidst the embers of a fire were found a heap of\r\nhuman bones. It may be imagined how British soldiers' hearts burned\r\nwithin them at such a sight, and how difficult it was to suppress\r\nfeelings of hatred and animosity towards the perpetrators of such a\r\ndastardly crime. I had a careful but unsuccessful search made for the\r\nbodies of our ill-fated friends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO THE BALA HISSAR, KABUL.\r\n_From a photograph._]\r\n\r\nThe Bala Hissar, at one time of great strength, was now in a somewhat\r\ndilapidated condition. It contained eighty-five guns, mortars and\r\nhowitzers, some of them of English manufacture, upwards of 250 tons of\r\ngunpowder, stowed away in earthen vessels, many millions of Enfield\r\nand Snider cartridges, and a large number of arms, besides quantities\r\nof saddlery, clothing for troops, musical instruments, shot, shell,\r\ncaps, and accoutrements, and a vast amount of lead, copper and tin. It\r\nwould not have given us much trouble to storm the Bala Hissar, had we\r\nbeen obliged to do so, for Artillery could have opened on it within\r\neasy range, and there was cover for Infantry close up to the walls.\r\n\r\nThe reading of the Proclamation announcing the intentions of the\r\nBritish Government with regard to the punishment of the city was\r\nto take place in the Bala Hissar next day. The Amir had agreed to\r\naccompany me. The leading people were invited to attend, and I had\r\ngiven orders that all the troops were to take part in the procession,\r\nso as to render as impressive as possible the ceremony, at which were\r\nto be made known to the inhabitants of Kabul the terms imposed upon\r\nthem by the British Government. The object of my visit was to decide\r\nhow the troops might best be disposed so as to make the most imposing\r\ndisplay on the occasion.\r\n\r\nI decided to detain in custody two Sirdars, Yahia Khan[1] and his\r\nbrother Zakariah Khan, the Mustaufi, and the Wazir, as these four\r\nwere Yakub Khan's principal advisers, and I was satisfied that their\r\ninfluence was being used against us, and that so long as they were at\r\nlarge a mine might be sprung upon me at any moment.\r\n\r\nThe Commander-in-Chief, Daud Shah, was also in the Amir's confidence;\r\nbut I determined to leave him at liberty, for, from what I could\r\nlearn, he had made an effort (not a very strong one, perhaps) to help\r\nour unfortunate countrymen, and he had on several occasions since he\r\nhad been in my camp given me useful information; moreover, I hoped\r\nto obtain further help from him, in which hope I was not altogether\r\ndisappointed.\r\n\r\nAs to what I ought to do with the Amir I was considerably puzzled.\r\nLord Lytton had urged upon me the necessity for weighing well the\r\nadvisability of prematurely breaking with him, as it was very possible\r\nhe might become a useful instrument in our hands, an eventuality which\r\nI thoroughly understood; but I was not at all sure that Yakub Khan\r\nwould not break with me when he learnt my decision with regard to his\r\nMinisters, and I had received more than one warning that, if he failed\r\nto keep me from entering Kabul, he contemplated flight and a supreme\r\neffort to raise the country against me.\r\n\r\nYakub Khan certainly did not deserve much consideration from us; for,\r\nthough no absolute proof was forthcoming of his having instigated the\r\nattack upon the Embassy, he most certainly made not the slightest\r\neffort to stop it or to save the lives of those entrusted to his\r\ncare, and throughout that terrible day showed himself to be, if not\r\na deliberate traitor, a despicable coward. Again, his endeavours to\r\ndelay the march of my force for the sole purpose of gaining sufficient\r\ntime to organize the destruction of the army to whose protection he\r\nhad appealed deprived him, to my mind, of the smallest claim to be\r\ntreated as an honourable ally.\r\n\r\nMy doubts as to what policy I ought to pursue with regard to Yakub\r\nKhan were all solved by his own action on the morning of the 12th\r\nOctober. He came to my tent before I was dressed, and asked for an\r\ninterview, which was, of course, accorded. The only chair I possessed\r\nI offered to my Royal visitor, who seated himself, and then and there\r\nannounced that he had come to resign the Amirship, and that he was\r\nonly carrying out a determination made before he came to Kushi; he had\r\nthen allowed himself to be over-persuaded, but now his resolution was\r\nfixed. His life, he said, had been most miserable, and he would rather\r\nbe a grass-cutter in the English camp than Ruler of Afghanistan; he\r\nconcluded by entreating me to allow his tent to be pitched close to\r\nmine until he could go to India, to London, or wherever the Viceroy\r\nmight desire to send him. I placed a tent at his disposal, ordered\r\nbreakfast to be prepared for him, and begged him not to decide at\r\nonce, but think the matter over for some hours, adding that I would\r\nsee him again at ten o'clock, the hour appointed for him to accompany\r\nme to the Bala Hissar in order that he might be present at the reading\r\nof the Proclamation. At this time, it must be remembered, the Amir did\r\nnot know what the terms of the Proclamation were, and was entirely\r\nignorant of my intentions regarding his Ministers.\r\n\r\nAs arranged, I had another interview with Yakub Khan at ten o'clock,\r\nwhen I found him unshaken in his resolve to abdicate, and unwilling,\r\nunder the circumstances, to be present at the ceremony which was about\r\nto take place. He said, however, that he would send his eldest son,\r\nand that all his Ministers should attend me. I begged him again to\r\nreconsider the decision he had come to, and to think well over the\r\nresults to himself; but finding that he had finally[2] made up his\r\nmind, I told His Highness I would telegraph his determination to the\r\nViceroy and ask for instructions; that he would not, of course, be\r\nforced to continue to reign at Kabul against his will, but that I\r\nwould ask him to retain his title until I could receive a reply from\r\nSimla.\r\n\r\nAt noon I proceeded to the Bala Hissar, accompanied by my staff, the\r\nHeir-Apparent, the Ministers, and a large gathering of the chief\r\nSirdars of Kabul. Both sides of the road were lined with troops, of\r\nwhom I felt not a little proud that day. Notwithstanding that the duty\r\nrequired of them had been severe and continuous, now that they were\r\nrequired to take part in a ceremonial parade, they turned out as clean\r\nand smart as one could wish to see them.\r\n\r\nAs the head of the procession entered the main gateway, the British\r\nflag was run up, the bands played the National Anthem, and a salute of\r\nthirty-one guns was fired.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the public Hall of Audience, I dismounted, and\r\nascending the steps leading to it, I addressed the assembled\r\nmultitude, and read to them the following Proclamation, containing the\r\norders of the British Government:\r\n\r\n    'In my Proclamation dated the 3rd October, I informed the people\r\n    of Kabul that a British army was advancing to take possession of\r\n    the city, and I warned them against offering any resistance to the\r\n    entry of the troops and the authority of His Highness the Amir.\r\n    That warning has been disregarded. The force under my command has\r\n    now reached Kabul and occupied the Bala Hissar, but its advance\r\n    has been pertinaciously opposed, and the inhabitants of the city\r\n    have taken a conspicuous part in the opposition offered. They have\r\n    therefore become rebels against His Highness the Amir, and have\r\n    added to the guilt already incurred by them in abetting the\r\n    murder of the British Envoy and his companions--a treacherous and\r\n    cowardly crime which has brought indelible disgrace upon the\r\n    Afghan people. It would be but a just and fitting reward for such\r\n    misdeeds if the city of Kabul were now totally destroyed and its\r\n    very name blotted out; but the great British Government ever\r\n    desires to temper justice with mercy, and I now announce to the\r\n    inhabitants of Kabul that the full retribution for their offence\r\n    will not be exacted, and that the city will be spared.\r\n\r\n    'Nevertheless, it is necessary that they should not escape all\r\n    penalty, and, further, that the punishment inflicted should be\r\n    such as will be felt and remembered. Therefore, such portions\r\n    of the city buildings as now interfere with the proper military\r\n    occupation of the Bala Hissar, and the safety and comfort of the\r\n    British troops to be quartered in it, will be at once levelled\r\n    with the ground; and, further, a heavy fine, the amount of which\r\n    will be notified hereafter, will be imposed upon the inhabitants\r\n    of Kabul, to be paid according to their several capacities. I\r\n    further give notice to all, that, in order to provide for the\r\n    restoration and maintenance of order, the city of Kabul and the\r\n    surrounding country, to a distance of ten miles, are placed under\r\n    martial law. With the consent of His Highness the Amir, a military\r\n    Governor of Kabul will be appointed, to administer justice and\r\n    punish with a strong hand all evil-doers. The inhabitants of Kabul\r\n    and of the neighbouring villages are hereby warned to submit to\r\n    his authority.\r\n\r\n    'This punishment, inflicted upon the whole city, will not, of\r\n    course, absolve from further penalties those whose individual\r\n    guilt may be hereafter proved. A full and searching inquiry into\r\n    the circumstances of the late outbreak will be held, and all\r\n    persons convicted of having taken part in it will be dealt with\r\n    according to their deserts.\r\n\r\n    'With the view of providing effectually for the prevention of\r\n    crime and disorder, and the safety of all well-disposed persons in\r\n    Kabul, it is hereby notified that for the future the carrying of\r\n    dangerous weapons, whether swords, knives, or firearms, within the\r\n    streets of the city or within a distance of five miles from the\r\n    city gates, is forbidden. After a week from the date of this\r\n    Proclamation, any person found armed within those limits will be\r\n    liable to the penalty of death. Persons having in their possession\r\n    any articles whatsoever which formerly belonged to members of\r\n    the British Embassy are required to bring them forthwith to the\r\n    British camp. Anyone neglecting this warning will, if found\r\n    hereafter in possession of any such articles, be subject to the\r\n    severest penalties.\r\n\r\n    'Further, all persons who may have in their possession any\r\n    firearms or ammunition formerly issued to or seized by the Afghan\r\n    troops, are required to produce them. For every country-made\r\n    rifle, whether breech or muzzle loading, the sum of Rs. 3 will be\r\n    given on delivery, and for every rifle of European manufacture Rs.\r\n    5. Anyone found hereafter in possession of such weapons will be\r\n    severely punished. Finally, I notify that I will give a reward\r\n    of Rs. 50 for the surrender of any person, whether soldier or\r\n    civilian, concerned in the attack on the British Embassy, or for\r\n    such information as may lead directly to his capture. A similar\r\n    sum will be given in the case of any person who may have fought\r\n    against the British troops since the 3rd September (Shawal) last,\r\n    and therefore become a rebel against His Highness the Amir. If any\r\n    such person so surrendered or captured be a captain or subaltern\r\n    officer of the Afghan army, the reward will be increased to Rs.\r\n    75, and if a field officer to Rs. 120.'\r\n\r\nThe Afghans were evidently much relieved at the leniency of the\r\nProclamation, to which they listened with the greatest attention.\r\nWhen I had finished reading it, I dismissed the assembly, with the\r\nexception of the Ministers whom I had decided to make prisoners. To\r\nthem I explained that I felt it to be my duty to place them under\r\nrestraint, pending investigation into the part they had taken in the\r\nmassacre of the Embassy.\r\n\r\nThe following day I made a formal entry into the city, traversing all\r\nits main streets, that the people might understand that it and they\r\nwere at our mercy. The Cavalry brigade headed the procession; I\r\nfollowed with my staff and escort, and five battalions of Infantry\r\nbrought up the rear; there were no Artillery, for in some places the\r\nstreets were so narrow and tortuous that two men could hardly ride\r\nabreast.\r\n\r\nIt was scarcely to be expected the citizens would give us a warm\r\nwelcome; but they were perfectly respectful, and I hoped the martial\r\nand workmanlike appearance of the troops would have a salutary effect.\r\n\r\nI now appointed Major-General James Hills, V.C., to be Governor of\r\nKabul for the time being, associating with him the able and respected\r\nMahomedan gentleman, Nawab Ghulam Hussein Khan, as the most likely\r\nmeans of securing for the present order and good government in the\r\ncity. I further instituted two Courts--one political, consisting of\r\nColonel Macgregor, Surgeon-Major Bellew,[3] and Mahomed Hyat Khan, a\r\nMahomedan member of the Punjab Commission, and an excellent Persian\r\nand Pushtu scholar, to inquire into the complicated circumstances\r\nwhich led to the attack on the Residency, and to ascertain, if\r\npossible, how far the Amir and his Ministers were implicated. The\r\nother, a military Court, with Brigadier-General Massy as president,\r\nfor the trial of those Chiefs and soldiers accused of having taken\r\npart in the actual massacre.[4]\r\n\r\nUp to this time (the middle of October) communication with India had\r\nbeen kept up by way of the Shutargardan, and I had heard nothing of\r\nthe approach of the Khyber column. It was so very necessary to open up\r\nthe Khyber route, in view of early snow on the Shutargardan, that I\r\narranged to send a small force towards Jalalabad, and to move the\r\nShutargardan garrison to Kabul, thus breaking off communication with\r\nKuram.\r\n\r\nColonel Money had beaten off another attack made by the tribesmen\r\non his position, but as they still threatened him in considerable\r\nnumbers, I despatched Brigadier-General Hugh Gough with some troops to\r\nenable him to withdraw. This reinforcement arrived at a most opportune\r\nmoment, when the augmented tribal combination, imagining that the\r\ngarrison was completely at its mercy, had sent a message to Money\r\noffering to spare their lives if they laid down their arms! So sure\r\nwere the Afghans of their triumph that they had brought 200 of\r\ntheir women to witness it. On Gough's arrival, Money dispersed the\r\ngathering, and his force left the Shutargardan, together with the\r\nHead-Quarters and two squadrons of the 9th Lancers, which had been\r\nordered to join me from Sialkot, and afterwards proved a most valuable\r\naddition to the Kabul Field Force.\r\n\r\nI was sitting in my tent on the morning of the 16th October, when I\r\nwas startled by a most terrific explosion in the upper part of the\r\nBala Hissar, which was occupied by the 5th Gurkhas, while the 67th\r\nFoot were pitched in the garden below. The gunpowder, stored in a\r\ndetached building, had somehow--we never could discover how--become\r\nignited, and I trembled at the thought of what would be the\r\nconsequences if the main magazine caught fire, which, with its 250\r\ntons of gunpowder, was dangerously near to the scene of the explosion.\r\nI at once sent orders to the Gurkhas and the 67th to clear out, and\r\nnot to wait even to bring away their tents, or anything but their\r\nammunition, and I did not breathe freely till they were all safe on\r\nSiah Sang. The results of this disaster, as it was, were bad enough,\r\nfor Captain Shafto, R.A. (a very promising officer), a private of the\r\n67th, the Subadar-Major of the 5th Gurkhas, and nineteen Natives, most\r\nof them soldiers, lost their lives.\r\n\r\nA second and more violent explosion took place two hours and a half\r\nafter the first, but there was no loss of life amongst the troops,\r\nthough several Afghans were killed at a distance of 400 yards from the\r\nfort.\r\n\r\nThere was given on this occasion a very practical exemplification\r\nof the good feeling existing between the European soldiers and the\r\nGurkhas. The 72nd and the 5th Gurkhas had been much associated from\r\nthe commencement of the campaign, and a spirit of _camaraderie_ had\r\nsprung up between them, resulting in the Highlanders now coming\r\nforward and insisting on making over their greatcoats to the little\r\nGurkhas for the night--a very strong proof of their friendship, for at\r\nKabul in October the nights are bitterly cold.\r\n\r\nTwo telegrams received about this time caused the greatest\r\ngratification throughout the force. One was from the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, conveying Her Majesty's expression of 'warm\r\nsatisfaction' at the conduct of the troops; the other was from the\r\nViceroy, expressing his 'cordial congratulations' and His Excellency's\r\n'high appreciation of the ability with which the action was directed,\r\nand the courage with which it was so successfully carried out.' I was\r\ninformed at the same time by Lord Lytton that, on the recommendation\r\nof the Commander-in-Chief, I was given the local rank of\r\nLieutenant-General, to enable me to be placed in command of all the\r\ntroops in eastern Afghanistan, a force of 20,000 men and 46 guns, in\r\ntwo divisions. The first division remained under my own immediate\r\ncommand, and Major-General R. O. Bright, C.B.,[5] was appointed to the\r\ncommand of the other. I was, of course very much pleased at this proof\r\nof the confidence reposed in me.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Yahia Khan was Yakub Khan's father-in-law.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: At an interview which Major Hastings, the Political\r\nOfficer, and Mr. Durand, my Political Secretary, had with His Highness\r\nat my request on the 23rd October, he said, referring to the subject\r\nof the Amirship: 'I call God and the Koran to witness, and everything\r\na Mussulman holds sacred, that my only desire is to be set free, and\r\nend my days in liberty. I have conceived an utter aversion for these\r\npeople. I always treated them well, and you see how they have rewarded\r\nme. So long as I was fighting in one place or another, they liked me\r\nwell enough. Directly I became Amir, and consulted their own good by\r\nmaking peace with you, they turned on me. Now I detest them all, and\r\nlong to be out of Afghanistan for ever. It is not that I am unable to\r\nhold the country; I have held it before and could hold it again, but I\r\nhave no further wish to rule such a people, and I beg of you to let me\r\ngo. If the British Government wish me to stay, I will stay, as their\r\nservant or as the Amir, if you like to call me so, until my son is of\r\nan age to succeed me, or even without that condition; but it will\r\nbe wholly against my own inclination, and I earnestly beg to be set\r\nfree.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Dr. Bellew was with the brothers Lumsden at Kandahar in\r\n1857.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: My action in endorsing the proceedings of this court,\r\nand my treatment of Afghans generally, were so adversely and severely\r\ncriticized by party newspapers and periodicals, and by members of the\r\nOpposition in the House of Commons, that I was called upon for an\r\nexplanation of my conduct, which was submitted and read in both Houses\r\nof Parliament by the Secretary of State for India, Viscount Cranbrook,\r\nand the Under-Secretary of State for India, the Hon. E. Stanhope. In\r\nthe Parliamentary records of February, 1880, can be seen my reply to\r\nthe accusations, as well as an abstract statement of the executions\r\ncarried out at Kabul in accordance with the findings of the military\r\nCourt.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Afterwards General Sir Robert Bright, G.C.B.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n1879\r\n\r\n  Afghans afraid to befriend us--Kabul Russianized\r\n  --Yakub Khan's abdication accepted--State treasury taken over\r\n\r\n\r\nI had given much thought to the question of housing the troops during\r\nthe winter, which was now fast approaching. Some of the senior\r\nofficers were in favour of quartering them in the Bala Hissar, as\r\nbeing the place with most prestige attached to it; but the fact that\r\nthere was not accommodation in it for the whole force, and that,\r\ntherefore, the troops would have to be separated, as well as the\r\ndangerous proximity of the huge store of gunpowder, which could only\r\nbe got rid of by degrees, decided me to occupy in preference the\r\npartly-fortified cantonment of Sherpur, about a mile north-east of the\r\ncity, and close to the ruins of the old British entrenchment. It was\r\nenclosed on three sides by a high and massive loop-holed wall, and on\r\nthe fourth by the Bimaru heights, while it possessed the advantage of\r\nhaving within its walls sufficient shelter in long ranges of brick\r\nbuildings for the British troops, and good hospital accommodation,\r\nand there was ample space for the erection of huts for the Native\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nThe drawback was that the great extent of its perimeter, more than\r\nfour and a half miles, made it a very difficult place to defend; but,\r\nremembering the grievous results of General Elphinstone's force being\r\nscattered in 1841, I thought the advantage of being able to keep my\r\ntroops together outweighed the disadvantage of having to defend so\r\nlong a line.\r\n\r\nMaterials for the Native soldiers' huts were brought from the Bala\r\nHissar, the demolition of which, as an act of retributive justice, I\r\nhad recommended to the Government of India, as it appeared to me that\r\nthe destruction of the fortified palace in which the massacre had\r\ntaken place, and which was the symbol of the power of the Afghans and\r\ntheir boasted military strength, would be a more fitting punishment\r\nfor treachery and insult than any other we could inflict, and a more\r\nlasting memorial of our ability to avenge our countrymen than any we\r\ncould raise. The tidings that their ancient citadel had been levelled\r\nto the ground would, I felt sure, spread throughout the length and\r\nbreadth of Afghanistan, bearing with them a political significance\r\nthat could hardly be over-estimated.\r\n\r\nI now set to work to collect supplies for the winter. A1 _khalsa_,\r\nor State grain, we took as our right, the justice of this being\r\nrecognized both by the Amir and the people, but what was the property\r\nof private individuals was purchased at a price the avaricious Afghan\r\ncould not resist. There had been a good harvest, and supplies were\r\nabundant; but the people from the outlying districts were chary of\r\nassisting us, for they knew from experience that all who befriended\r\nthe British would be sure to suffer when we took our departure.\r\n\r\nI had repeated complaints brought to me of the harshness and injustice\r\nwith which those who had shown themselves well disposed towards us\r\nwere treated by the Amir on his return from signing the Treaty at\r\nGandamak, and most of the Afghans were so afraid of the Amir's\r\nvengeance when they should again be left to his tender mercies, that\r\nthey held aloof, except those who, like Wali Mahomed Khan and his\r\nfollowing, were in open opposition to Yakub Khan, and some few who\r\nwere still smarting from recent injury and oppression.\r\n\r\nI was frequently asked by the Afghans, when requiring some service to\r\nbe rendered, 'Are you going to remain?' Could I have replied in the\r\naffirmative, or could I have said that we should continue to exercise\r\nsufficient control over the Government of the country to prevent their\r\nbeing punished for helping us, they would have served us willingly.\r\nNot that I could flatter myself they altogether liked us, but\r\nthey would have felt it wise in their own interests to meet our\r\nrequirements; and, besides, the great mass of the people were heartily\r\nsick and tired of a long continuance of oppression and misrule, and\r\nwere ready to submit (for a time, at least) to any strong and just\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nLord Lytton, in the hope of saving from the resentment of the Amir\r\nthose who had been of use to us in the early part of the war, had\r\nexpressly stipulated in Article II. of the Gandamak Treaty that 'a\r\nfull and complete amnesty should be published, absolving all Afghans\r\nfrom any responsibility on account of intercourse with the British\r\nForces during the campaign, and that the Amir should guarantee\r\nto protect all persons, of whatever degree, from punishment or\r\nmolestation on that account.'\r\n\r\nBut this stipulation was not adhered to. Yakub Khan more than once\r\nspoke to me about it, and declared that it was impossible to control\r\nthe turbulent spirits in Afghanistan without being supreme, and that\r\nthis amnesty, had it been published, would have tied his hands with\r\nregard to those who had proved themselves his enemies.\r\n\r\nHis neglect to carry out this Article of the treaty added considerably\r\nto my difficulty, as will be seen from the following letter from\r\nAsmatula Khan, a Ghilzai Chief, to whom I wrote, asking him to meet me\r\nat Kabul.\r\n\r\n    'I received your kind letter on the 8th of Shawal [28th\r\n    September], and understood its contents, and also those of the\r\n    enclosed Proclamation to the people of Kabul. I informed all whom\r\n    I thought fit of the contents of the Proclamation.\r\n\r\n    'Some time ago I went to Gandamak to Major Cavagnari. He\r\n    instructed me to obey the orders of the Amir, and made me over to\r\n    His Highness. When Major Cavagnari returned to India, the Amir's\r\n    officials confiscated my property, and gave the Chiefship to my\r\n    cousin[1] [or enemy], Bakram Khan.\r\n\r\n    'The oppression I suffered on your account is beyond description.\r\n    They ruined and disgraced every friend and adherent of mine. On\r\n    the return of Major Cavagnari to Kabul, I sent my Naib [deputy] to\r\n    him, who informed him of my state. Major Cavagnari sent a message\r\n    to me to the effect that I should recover my property by force if\r\n    I could, otherwise I should go to the hills, and not come to Kabul\r\n    until I heard from him. In the meantime I received news of the\r\n    murder of the Envoy, and I am still in the hills.'\r\n\r\nThe thought of what might be in store for those who were now aiding me\r\ntroubled me a good deal. No doubt their help was not disinterested,\r\nbut they were 'friends in need,' and I could not be quite indifferent\r\nto their future.\r\n\r\nI had several interesting conversations with Yakub Khan, and in\r\ndiscussing with him Sher Ali's reasons for breaking with us, he dwelt\r\non the fact that his father, although he did not get all he wished out\r\nof Lord Mayo, was fairly satisfied and content with what had been done\r\nfor him, but when Saiyad Nur Mahomed returned from Simla in 1873,\r\nhe became thoroughly disgusted, and at once made overtures to the\r\nRussians, with whom constant intercourse had since been kept up.\r\n\r\nYakub Khan's statements were verified by the fact that we found Kabul\r\nmuch more Russian than English. The Afghan Sirdars and officers were\r\narrayed in Russian pattern uniforms, Russian money was found in the\r\ntreasury, Russian wares were sold in the bazaars, and although the\r\nroads leading to Central Asia were certainly no better than those\r\nleading to India, Russia had taken more advantage of them than we had\r\nto carry on commercial dealings with Afghanistan.[2]\r\n\r\nWhen I inquired of Yakub Khan what had become of the correspondence\r\nwhich must have been carried on between his father and the Russians,\r\nhe declared that he had destroyed it all when on his way to Gandamak;\r\nnevertheless, a certain number of letters[3] from Generals Kauffmann\r\nand Stoliatoff came into my possession, and a draft of the treaty the\r\nlatter officer brought from Tashkent was made for me from memory by\r\nthe man who had copied it for Sher Ali, aided by the Afghan official\r\nwho was told off to be in attendance on Stoliatoff, and who had\r\nfrequently read the treaty.\r\n\r\nIn one of my last conversations with Yakub Khan, he advised me 'not to\r\nlose sight of Herat and Turkestan.' On my asking him whether he had\r\nany reason to suppose that his representatives in those places meant\r\nto give trouble, he replied: 'I cannot say what they may do; but,\r\nremember, I have warned you.' He, no doubt, knew more than he told\r\nme, and I think it quite possible that he had some inkling of his\r\nbrother's[4] (Ayub Khan's) intentions, in regard to Kandahar, and he\r\nprobably foresaw that Abdur Rahman Khan would appear on the scene from\r\nthe direction of Turkestan.\r\n\r\nI duly received an answer to my telegram regarding the abdication of\r\nYakub Khan, in which I was informed that His Highness's resignation\r\nwas accepted by Her Majesty's Government, and I was directed to\r\nannounce the fact to the people of Afghanistan in the following terms:\r\n\r\n    'I, General Roberts, on behalf of the British Government, hereby\r\n    proclaim that the Amir, having by his own free will abdicated,\r\n    has left Afghanistan without a Government. In consequence of the\r\n    shameful outrage upon its Envoy and suite, the British Government\r\n    has been compelled to occupy by force of arms Kabul, the capital,\r\n    and to take military possession of other parts of Afghanistan.\r\n\r\n    'The British Government now commands that all Afghan authorities,\r\n    Chiefs, and Sirdars do continue their functions in maintaining\r\n    order, referring to me whenever necessary.\r\n\r\n    'The British Government desire that the people shall be treated\r\n    with justice and benevolence, and that their religious feelings\r\n    and customs be respected.\r\n\r\n    'The services of such Sirdars and Chiefs as assist in preserving\r\n    order will be duly recognized, but all disturbers of the peace and\r\n    persons concerned in attacks upon the British authority will meet\r\n    with condign punishment.\r\n\r\n    'The British Government, after consultation with the principal\r\n    Sirdars, tribal Chiefs, and others representing the interests and\r\n    wishes of the various provinces and cities, will declare its will\r\n    as to the future permanent arrangements to be made for the good\r\n    government of the people.'\r\n\r\nThis manifesto was issued on the 28th October, and the same day\r\nI informed Yakub Khan that his abdication had been accepted, and\r\nacquainted him with the orders passed by the British Government in\r\nconnexion with this fact.[5]\r\n\r\nYakub Khan showed no interest either in the Proclamation, a Persian\r\ntranslation of which was read to him, or the Government's decision as\r\nto himself, and made no comment beyond a formal '_bisyar khub_' ('very\r\ngood') and an inclination of the head.\r\n\r\nI then told Yakub Khan that, as I was now charged with the government\r\nof the country, it was necessary that I should take possession of the\r\ntreasury and all moneys therein. He signified his assent, but demurred\r\nto certain sums being considered as public property, contending\r\nthat they formed part of his father's wealth, and that the British\r\nGovernment might as well take from him his _choga_,[6] this\r\nalso having come from the pockets of the people. 'My father was\r\n_Padishah_,' he said; 'there was no distinction between public and\r\nprivate money. However,' he went on, 'I have given up the crown, and I\r\nam not going to dispute about rupees. You may take all I have, down to\r\nmy clothes; but the money was my father's, and is mine by right.'\r\n\r\nI replied that it was necessary that all money in his possession\r\nshould be given up, but that his private effects should not be\r\ntouched; that he would be given a receipt for the money, and that, if\r\nthe Government of India decided it to be his personal property, it\r\nshould be returned to him.\r\n\r\nThis Yakub Khan at first declined to accept, with some show of temper.\r\nEventually he came round, and said, 'Yes, give me a receipt, so that\r\nno one may say hereafter that I carried off State money to which I\r\nhad no right. It can be easily made sure that I have no money when I\r\ngo.'[7]\r\n\r\nSpite of all his shortcomings, I could not help feeling sorry for the\r\nself-deposed Ruler, and before leaving him I explained that he would\r\nbe treated with the same consideration that had always been accorded\r\nto him, that Nawab Sir Ghulam Hussein Khan[8] should have a tent next\r\nto his, and that it should be the Nawab's care to look after his\r\ncomfort in every way, and that I should be glad to see him whenever he\r\nwished for an interview. That same day, under instructions, I issued\r\nthe following further manifesto:\r\n\r\n    'In my Proclamation of yesterday I announced that His Highness the\r\n    Amir had of his own free will abdicated, and that for the present\r\n    the government of Afghanistan would be carried on under my\r\n    supervision. I now proclaim that, in order to provide for the cost\r\n    of administration, I have taken possession of the State treasury,\r\n    and that, until the British Government shall declare its will\r\n    as to the permanent arrangements to be made for the future good\r\n    government of the country, the collection of revenue and the\r\n    expenditure of public money will be regulated by me. All persons\r\n    concerned are hereby informed that they must obey without dispute\r\n    or delay such orders as may be issued by me in regard to the\r\n    payment of taxes and other connected matters; and I give plain\r\n    warning that anyone resisting or obstructing the execution of such\r\n    orders will be treated with the utmost severity as an enemy to the\r\n    British Government.'\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In Pushtu the word _tarbur_ signifies a cousin to any\r\ndegree, and is not unfrequently used as 'enemy,' the inference being\r\nthat in Afghanistan a cousin is necessarily an enemy.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: As I reported at the time, the magnitude of Sher\r\nAli's military preparations was, in my opinion, a fact of peculiar\r\nsignificance. He had raised and equipped with arms of precision\r\nsixteen regiments of Cavalry and sixty-eight of Infantry, while his\r\nArtillery amounted to nearly 300 guns. Numbers of skilled artisans\r\nwere constantly employed in the manufacture of rifled cannon and\r\nbreech-loading small arms. Swords, helmets, uniforms, and other\r\narticles of military equipment, were stored in proportionate\r\nquantities. Upon the construction of the Sherpur cantonment Sher Ali\r\nhad expended an astonishing amount of labour and money. The size and\r\ncost of this work may be judged from the fact that the main line of\r\nrampart, with barrack accommodation, extended to a length of nearly\r\ntwo miles under the western and southern slopes of the Bimaru hills,\r\nwhile the original design was to carry the wall entirely round the\r\nhills, a distance of four and a half miles, and the foundations were\r\nlaid for a considerable portion of this length. All these military\r\npreparations must have been going on for some years, and were quite\r\nunnecessary, except as a provision for contemplated hostilities with\r\nourselves. Sher Ali had refused during this time to accept the subsidy\r\nwe had agreed to pay him, and it is difficult to understand how their\r\nentire cost could have been met from the Afghan treasury, the annual\r\ngross revenue of the country at that time amounting only to about 80\r\nlakhs of rupees.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: These letters, as well as my report to the Secretary to\r\nthe Government of India in the Foreign Department, with an account of\r\nmy conversation with Yakub Khan, are given in the Appendix.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Sirdar Ayub Khan was Governor of Herat in 1879.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: There were present at the interview, besides myself,\r\nColonel Macgregor, Major Hastings, Surgeon-Major Bellew, Nawab Sir\r\nGhulam Hussein Khan, and Mr. H.M. Durand.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: A kind of mantle worn by Afghans.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: As Yakub Khan refused under one pretext or another to\r\ndeliver up any money, Major Moriarty, the officer in charge of the\r\nKabul Field Force treasure-chest, and Lieutenant Neville Chamberlain,\r\naccompanied by an escort, searched a house in the city in which a\r\nportion of Yakub Khan's money was said to be concealed. Upwards of\r\neight and a half lakhs of rupees, and a certain amount of jewellery\r\nand gold coins, tillas and Russian five-rouble pieces, in all\r\namounting to nine and a half lakhs, were found. This sum was\r\nsubsequently refunded to the Afghan Government.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: The Nawab had been made a K.C.S.I.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n1879\r\n\r\n  The amnesty Proclamation--Strength of the Kabul Field Force\r\n  --Yakub Khan despatched to India\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 1st November my Head-Quarters and the 1st division moved into\r\nSherpur, which the Engineers had prepared for winter quarters, and\r\nwhere stores of provisions and forage were assuming satisfactory\r\nproportions. The same day Brigadier-General Macpherson left Kabul with\r\na brigade of about 1,800 men and four guns to join hands with the\r\ntroops which I had lately heard were advancing from the Khyber, and\r\nhad reached Gandamak. I joined Macpherson the following morning at\r\nButkhak, about eleven miles from Kabul, where our first post towards\r\nthe Khyber had already been established. It was very important that\r\nour communication with India should be by a route good enough for\r\nwheeled carriages; I was therefore anxious to see for myself if it\r\nwere not possible to avoid the Khurd-Kabul Pass, which was said to be\r\nvery difficult. I had, besides, a strong wish to visit this pass, as\r\nbeing the scene of Sir Robert Sale's fight with the tribesmen in\r\n1841, and of the beginning of the massacre of General Elphinstone's\r\nunfortunate troops in 1842.[1] The Afghan Commander-in-Chief, Daud\r\nShah, and several Ghilzai Chiefs, accompanied me; from them I learned\r\nthat an easier road did exist, running more to the east, and crossing\r\nover the Lataband mountain. Personal inspection of the two lines\r\nproved that Daud Shah's estimate of their respective difficulties\r\nwas correct; the Lataband route was comparatively easy, there was no\r\ndefile as on the Khurd-Kabul side, and the kotal, 8,000 feet above the\r\nsea, was reached by a gradual ascent from Butkhak. However, I found\r\nthe Khurd-Kabul much less difficult than I had imagined it to be; it\r\nmight have been made passable for carts, but there was no object in\r\nusing it, as the Lataband route possessed the additional advantage\r\nof being some miles shorter; accordingly I decided upon adopting the\r\nlatter as the line of communication with India.\r\n\r\nMacpherson reported that the country beyond Khurd-Kabul was fairly\r\nsettled, and that, on the 7th, he had been able to open communication\r\nwith Brigadier-General Charles Gough, commanding Bright's leading\r\nbrigade. I was thus again brought into communication with India, and\r\nin a position to clear my hospitals of those amongst the sick and\r\nwounded who were not progressing favourably, and could not soon be fit\r\nfor duty.\r\n\r\nBy this time the Inquiry Commission had completed its difficult task\r\nof trying to sift the truth concerning the fate of Cavagnari and his\r\ncompanions from the mass of falsehood with which it was enveloped. The\r\nprogress had been slow, particularly when examination touched on the\r\npart Yakub Khan had played in the tragedy; witnesses were afraid to\r\ngive evidence openly until they were convinced that he would not be\r\nre-established in a position to avenge himself. The whole matter had\r\nbeen gone into most fully, and a careful perusal of the proceedings\r\nsatisfied me that the Amir could not have been ignorant that an attack\r\non the Residency was contemplated. He may not have foreseen or desired\r\nthe massacre of the Embassy, but there was no room for doubt as to his\r\nhaving connived at a demonstration against it, which, had it not ended\r\nso fatally, might have served him in good stead as a proof of his\r\ninability to guarantee the safety of foreigners, and thus obtain the\r\nwithdrawal of the Mission.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible, under these circumstances, that Yakub Khan could\r\never be reinstated as Ruler of Kabul, and his remaining in his present\r\nequivocal position was irksome to himself and most embarrassing to me.\r\nI therefore recommended that he should be deported to India, to\r\nbe dealt with as the Government might decide after reviewing the\r\ninformation elicited by the political Court of Inquiry, which to\r\nme appeared to tell so weightily against the ex-Amir, that, in my\r\nopinion, I was no longer justified in treating as rebels to his\r\nauthority Afghans who, it was now evident, had only carried out his\r\nsecret, if not his expressed, wishes when opposing our advance\r\non Kabul. I decided, therefore, to proclaim a free and complete\r\namnesty[2] to all persons not concerned, directly or indirectly,\r\nin the attack on the Residency, or who were not found hereafter in\r\npossession of property belonging to our countrymen or their escort, on\r\nthe condition that they surrendered their arms and returned to their\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\nAt Daud Shah's suggestion, I sent three influential Sirdars to the\r\nLogar, Kohistan, and Maidan valleys, to superintend the collection of\r\nthe amount of forage which was to be levied from those districts;\r\nand in order to lessen the consumption at Kabul, I sent away all\r\nelephants,[3] spare bullocks, and sick transport animals. In\r\nfurtherance of the same object, as soon as Macpherson returned, I sent\r\nBaker with a brigade into the Maidan district, about twenty miles from\r\nKabul, on the Ghazni road, where the troops could more easily be fed,\r\nas it was the district from which a large proportion of our supplies\r\nwas expected, and I also despatched to India all time-expired men and\r\ninvalids who were no longer fit for service.[4]\r\n\r\nTowards the end of November, Mr. Luke, the officer in charge of the\r\ntelegraph department, who had done admirable work throughout the\r\ncampaign, reported that communication was established with India. As,\r\nhowever, cutting the telegraph-wires was a favourite amusement of the\r\ntribesmen, a heliograph was arranged at suitable stations between\r\nLandi Kotal and Kabul, which was worked with fair success to the\r\nend of the war. Had we then possessed the more perfect heliographic\r\napparatus which is now available, it would have made us, in that\r\nland of bright sun, almost independent of the telegraph, so far as\r\nconnexion with Landi Kotal was concerned.\r\n\r\nHearing that Baker was experiencing difficulty in collecting his\r\nsupplies, I joined him at Maidan to satisfy myself how matters stood.\r\nThe headmen in the neighbourhood refused to deliver the _khalsa_ grain\r\nthey had been ordered to furnish, and, assisted by a body of Ghilzais\r\nfrom Ghazni and Wardak, they attacked our Cavalry charged with\r\ncollecting it, and murdered our agent, Sirdar Mahomed Hussein Khan.\r\nFor these offences I destroyed the chief _malik's_ fort and confiscated\r\nhis store of grain, after which there was no more trouble, and\r\nsupplies came in freely. I returned to Kabul, and Baker, with his\r\nbrigade, followed me on the 1st December.\r\n\r\nThat same day Yakub Khan was despatched by double marches to India,\r\ncareful precautions having been taken to prevent his being rescued on\r\nthe way. When saying good-bye to him, he thanked me warmly for the\r\nkindness and consideration he had received, and assured me that he\r\nleft his wives and children in my hands in the fullest confidence that\r\nthey would be well treated and cared for.\r\n\r\nA week later I sent off the two Sirdars, Yahia Khan and Zakariah Khan,\r\nas well as the Wazir, whose guilt had been clearly proved, and whose\r\npowerful influence, I had every reason to believe, was being used to\r\nstir up the country against us. The Mustaufi I allowed to remain; he\r\nhad been less prominent than the others in opposing us, and, besides,\r\nI had an idea that he might prove useful to me in the administration\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A most thrilling account of Elphinstone's retreat through\r\nthis pass is given in Kaye's 'History of the War in Afghanistan,' vol.\r\nii., p. 229.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The amnesty Proclamation ran as follows:\r\n\r\n    'KABUL,\r\n    '_12th November, 1879._\r\n\r\n    'To all whom it may concern. On the 12th October a Proclamation\r\n    was issued in which I offered a reward for the surrender of any\r\n    person who had fought against the British troops since the 3rd\r\n    September, and had thereby become a rebel against the Amir Yakub\r\n    Khan. I have now received information which tends to show that\r\n    some, at least, of those who shared in the opposition encountered\r\n    by the British troops during their advance on Kabul, were led to\r\n    do so by the belief that the Amir was a prisoner in my camp, and\r\n    had called upon the soldiery and people of Kabul to rise on his\r\n    behalf. Such persons, although enemies to the British Government,\r\n    were not rebels against their own Sovereign, and the great British\r\n    Government does not seek for vengeance against enemies who no\r\n    longer resist. It may be that few only of those who took up arms\r\n    were thus led away by the statements of evil-minded men, but\r\n    rather than punish the innocent with the guilty, I am willing to\r\n    believe that all were alike deceived. On behalf of the British\r\n    Government, therefore, I proclaim a free and complete amnesty to\r\n    all persons who have fought against the British troops since the\r\n    3rd September, provided that they now give up any arms in their\r\n    possession and return to their homes. The offer of a reward for\r\n    the surrender of such persons is now withdrawn, and they will\r\n    not for the future be molested in any way on account of their\r\n    opposition to the British advance; but it must be clearly\r\n    understood that the benefits of this amnesty do not extend to\r\n    anyone, whether soldier or civilian, who was concerned directly or\r\n    indirectly in the attack upon the Residency, or who may hereafter\r\n    be found in possession of any property belonging to members of the\r\n    Embassy. To such persons no mercy will be shown. Further, I hold\r\n    out no promise of pardon to those who, well knowing the Amir's\r\n    position in the British camp, instigated the troops and people of\r\n    Kabul to take up arms against the British troops. They have been\r\n    guilty of wilful rebellion against the Amir's authority, and they\r\n    will be considered and treated as rebels wherever found.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: There was a slight fall of snow on the 11th November,\r\nfollowed by severe frost, and the elephants were beginning to suffer\r\nfrom the cold.

After\r\nthe outbreak in the previous September and the massacre of our Envoy,\r\nthe advance of the British force was too rapid to give the Afghans, as\r\na nation, time to oppose us. At Charasia, the troops, aided by large\r\nnumbers of the disaffected townspeople, were conspicuously beaten in\r\nthe open field; their organization as an armed body was at an end, and\r\ntheir leaders all sought personal safety in flight.\r\n\r\nIt appears probable that at this period the general expectation\r\namongst the Afghans was that the British Government would exact a\r\nheavy retribution from the nation and city, and that, after vengeance\r\nhad been satisfied, the army would be withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThirty-seven years before, a British massacre had been followed by a\r\ntemporary occupation of the city of Kabul, and just as the troops of\r\nPollock and Nott, on that occasion, had sacked and destroyed the great\r\nbazaar and then retired, so in 1879 the people believed that some\r\nsignal punishment would again be succeeded by the withdrawal of our\r\ntroops. Thus a period of doubt and expectation ensued after the battle\r\nof Charasia; the Afghans were waiting on events, and the time had not\r\narrived for a general movement.\r\n\r\nThis pause, however, was marked by certain occurrences which doubtless\r\ntouched the national pride to the quick, and which were also\r\nsusceptible of being used by the enemies of the British Government to\r\nexcite into vivid fanaticism the religious sentiment, which has ever\r\nformed a prominent trait in the Afghan character.\r\n\r\nThe prolonged occupation by foreign troops of the fortified cantonment\r\nwhich had been prepared by the late Amir Sher Ali for his own army;\r\nthe capture of the large park of Artillery, and of the vast munitions\r\nof war, which had raised the military strength of the Afghans to a\r\nstandard unequalled among Asiatic nations; the destruction of their\r\nhistoric fortress, the residence of their Kings; and, lastly, the\r\ndeportation to India of their Amir and his principal Ministers,\r\nwere all circumstances which united to increase to a high pitch the\r\nantipathy naturally felt towards a foreign invader.\r\n\r\nThe temper of the people being in this inflammable condition, it was\r\nclear that only disunion and jealousy amongst their Chiefs prevented\r\ntheir combining against us, and that if any impetus could be given\r\nto their religious sentiment strong enough to unite the discordant\r\nelements in a common cause, a powerful movement would be initiated,\r\nhaving for its object our annihilation or expulsion from their\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nSuch an impetus was supplied by the fervent preaching of the aged\r\nmulla Mushk-i-Alam,[1] who denounced the English in every mosque\r\nthroughout the country. The people were further incited to rise by the\r\nappeals of the ladies of Yakub Khan's family to popular sympathy, and\r\nbribed to do so by the distribution of the concealed treasure at their\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nThe mullas, in short, became masters of the situation, and, having\r\nonce succeeded in subordinating private quarrels to hatred of the\r\ncommon foe, the movement rapidly assumed the aspect of a religious\r\nwar. The Afghan successes of 1841-42 were cited as examples of what\r\nmight happen again, and the people were assured that, if they would\r\nonly act simultaneously, the small British army in Sherpur would\r\nbe overwhelmed, and the plunder of our camp would be part of their\r\nreward.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time reports reached me of what was going on, and, from\r\nthe information supplied to me, I gathered that the Afghans intended\r\nto gain possession of the city, and, after occupying the numerous\r\nforts and villages in the neighbourhood of Sherpur, to surround the\r\ncantonment.\r\n\r\nIt was under the stimulating influences of religious enthusiasm,\r\npatriotic and military ardour, the prestige of former success, and\r\nthe hope of remuneration and plunder, that the Afghans took the field\r\nagainst us early in December.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that the forces from the south[2] should seize the\r\nrange of hills extending from Charasia to the Shahr-i-Darwaza heights,\r\nincluding the fortifications of the upper Bala Hissar and the high\r\nconical peak called the Takht-i-Shah; that those from the north[3]\r\nshould occupy the Asmai heights and hills to the north of Kabul; and\r\nthose from the west[4] should make direct for the city.\r\n\r\nAs it was evident to me that these several bodies, when once\r\nconcentrated at Kabul, would be joined by the thousands in the city,\r\nand the inhabitants of the adjoining villages, I determined to try\r\nand deal with the advancing forces in detail, and disperse them, if\r\npossible, before the concentration could be effected. I had, however,\r\nbut a very imperfect idea of the extent of the combination, or of\r\nthe enormous numbers arrayed against us. My intelligence was most\r\ndefective; neither the nature of the country nor the attitude of the\r\npeople admitted of extended reconnaissances, and I was almost entirely\r\ndependent for information on Afghan sources. Some of the Afghan\r\nsoldiers in our ranks aided me to the best of their ability, but by\r\nthe Sirdars, notably Wali Mahomed Khan, I was, either wilfully or from\r\nignorance, grossly misinformed as to the formidable character of the\r\nrising. But that there was serious trouble ahead was plain enough when\r\nthe conflicting reports had been carefully sifted, and I therefore\r\nthought it only prudent to telegraph to General Bright at Jalalabad to\r\npush on the Guide Corps, although I was very much averse to augmenting\r\nthe Sherpur garrison, and thereby increasing the drain on our\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime immediate action was necessary to carry out my idea of\r\npreventing the different sections of the enemy concentrating at Kabul.\r\nI accordingly prepared two columns: one under Macpherson, whose orders\r\nwere to attack the tribesmen coming from the north before they could\r\njoin those advancing from the west; the other under Baker, who was\r\ninstructed to place himself across the line by which the enemy would\r\nhave to retreat when beaten, as I hoped they would be, by Macpherson.\r\n\r\nMacpherson[5] started on the 8th towards Kila Aushar, about three\r\nmiles from Sherpur, _en route_ to Arghandeh. And on the following\r\nmorning Baker, with a small force,[6] proceeded to Chihal Dukhteran,\r\ngiving out that his destination was the Logar valley, and that he\r\nwould march by Charasia, as I had directed him to make a feint in that\r\ndirection, and then to turn to the west, and place himself between\r\nArghandeh and Maidan, on the Ghazni road.\r\n\r\nTo give Baker time to carry out this movement, I halted Macpherson at\r\nKila Aushar on the 9th, whence he sent out two reconnoitring\r\nparties--one in the direction of Kohistan, the other, in charge of\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Lockhart,[7] A.Q.M.G., towards Arghandeh.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence brought in induced me to change my orders to\r\nMacpherson. The first party reported that a very considerable force of\r\nKohistanis had collected at Karez-i-Mir, about ten miles north of\r\nKila Aushar, while Lockhart had discovered large numbers of the enemy\r\nmoving from Arghandeh and Paghman towards Kohistan. Accordingly, I\r\ndirected Macpherson to attack the Kohistanis, in the hope of being\r\nable to disperse them before the people from Ghazni could join them;\r\nand, as the part of the country through which he had to move was\r\nunsuited to Horse Artillery and Cavalry, I ordered him to leave the\r\nmounted portion of his column, except one squadron of Cavalry, at Kila\r\nAushar.\r\n\r\nMacpherson made a rapid advance on the morning of the 10th December,\r\nskirting the fringe of low hills which intervenes between Kohistan and\r\nthe Chardeh valley. He reached the Surkh Kotal--which divides western\r\nKohistan from the Arghandeh valley--without opposition. From this\r\npoint, however, the Kohistanis were sighted, occupying a position\r\nabout two miles to his right front, their centre on a steep, conical,\r\nisolated hill, at the base of which lay the village of Karez-i-Mir.\r\n\r\nMacpherson was now able to obtain a good view of the Paghman and\r\nChardeh valleys on his left and left rear, and the numerous standards\r\nplanted on the different knolls near the villages of Paghman gave\r\nample evidence of the presence of the enemy discovered by Lockhart the\r\nprevious day, and showed him that, unless he could quickly succeed in\r\nscattering the Kohistanis, he would find himself attacked by an enemy\r\nin his rear, in fact, between two fires.\r\n\r\nMacpherson made his disposition for an attack with skill and rapidity.\r\nLeaving Lieutenant-Colonel Money with one company of the 67th, five\r\ncompanies of the 3rd Sikhs, and two guns, to hold the ridge, he sent\r\nthe remainder of the Sikhs to harass the enemy's left flank and\r\nsupport the Cavalry, who were ordered to hover about and threaten the\r\nline of retreat, while Macpherson himself went forward with the rest\r\nof the force.\r\n\r\nThe Kohistanis retreated rapidly before our skirmishers, and the\r\nattacking party, protected by a well-directed fire from Morgan's guns,\r\nadvanced with such promptitude that the enemy made no attempt to\r\nrally until they reached the conical hill, where they made a stubborn\r\nresistance. The hill was carried by assault, its defenders were driven\r\noff, leaving seven standards on the field, and Morgan, bringing up his\r\nArtillery, inflicted severe loss on the flying Kohistanis. On this\r\noccasion Major Cook, V.C., of the 5th Gurkhas, was again noticed for\r\nhis conspicuous gallantry, and Major Griffiths, of the 3rd Sikhs,\r\ngreatly distinguished himself. Our casualties were one officer\r\n(Lieutenant-Colonel Fitz-Hugh) and six men wounded.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the tribesmen from the directions of Arghandeh and\r\nPaghman intended to ascend the Surkh Kotal, but suddenly they appeared\r\nto change their minds, on discovering, probably, that our troops\r\nheld all the commanding positions and that their allies were in full\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nSoon after noon on the 10th I received the report of Macpherson's\r\nsuccess and the enemy's retirement towards Arghandeh. I at once sent\r\noff Lieutenant-Colonel B. Gordon, R.H.A., with orders to intercept\r\nthem with the Horse Artillery and Cavalry at Aushar; but when I rode\r\nover myself later in the day to that place, I was much disappointed to\r\nfind that Gordon had not been able to give effect to my instructions,\r\nas the enemy, on perceiving his troops, dispersed and took shelter in\r\nthe surrounding villages and on the slopes of the hills.\r\n\r\nMacpherson encamped for the night between the Surkh Kotal and\r\nKarez-i-Mir, and Baker, who had steadily pursued his march along a\r\nvery difficult road, halted a short distance west of Maidan and eight\r\nmiles only from Arghandeh.\r\n\r\nTo Macpherson I sent orders to march very early the next morning--the\r\n11th--through Paghman towards Arghandeh and in Baker's direction; at\r\nthe same time I informed him that Massy, whom I had placed in command\r\nof the troops at Aushar, would, according to directions from me, leave\r\nthat place at nine o'clock to co-operate with him, _viâ_ the Arghandeh\r\nand Ghazni road. That evening Massy came to my room, and I carefully\r\nexplained to him his part in the next day's proceedings; I told him\r\nthat he was to advance cautiously and quietly by the road leading\r\ndirectly from the city of Kabul towards Arghandeh, feeling for\r\nthe enemy; that he was to communicate with Macpherson and act in\r\nconformity with that officer's movements; and I impressed upon him\r\nthat he was on no account to commit himself to an action until\r\nMacpherson had engaged the enemy.\r\n\r\nUp to this time the combination of tribesmen, which later proved so\r\nformidable, had not been effected; Macpherson for the time being had\r\ndispersed the Kohistanis and checked the force advancing from Ghazni\r\nunder the leadership of Mahomed Jan; the Logaris and Ghilzais were\r\nmerely watching events, and waiting to see how it fared with the\r\nKohistani and Ghazni factions, before committing themselves to\r\nhostilities; they had but recently witnessed our successful advance\r\nthrough their country; they knew that their homes and property would\r\nbe at our mercy should we be victorious, and they were uncertain as to\r\nBaker's movements.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 11th December,[8] therefore, only one section\r\nwas actually in opposition to us, that led by Mahomed Jan, who during\r\nthe night of the 10th had taken up a position near the group of\r\nvillages known as Kila Kazi.\r\n\r\nFurther, I felt that Mahomed Jan must be disheartened at our recent\r\nsuccess, and at his failure to induce the Logaris to join him, and\r\ndoubtless felt that a movement towards Kabul would expose his left\r\nflank to Macpherson, while his rear would be threatened by Baker.\r\n\r\nThe strength of Baker's and Macpherson's columns had been carefully\r\nconsidered, as well as the routes they were to take. I was thoroughly\r\nwell acquainted with the ground comprised in the theatre of the\r\nproposed operations, having frequently ridden over it during the\r\npreceding two months; I was thus able to calculate to a nicety the\r\ndifficulties each column would have to encounter and the distances\r\nthey would have to cover, and arrange with the utmost precision the\r\nhour at which each Commander should move off to insure a timely\r\njunction. So that when I left Sherpur at ten o'clock on the 11th\r\nDecember to take command of Macpherson's and Massy's columns as soon\r\nas they should unite, I had no misgivings, and was sanguine that my\r\ncarefully arranged programme would result in the discomfiture of\r\nMahomed Jan; but the events which followed on that day afforded a\r\nstriking exemplification of the uncertainty of war, and of how even a\r\nvery slight divergence from a General's orders may upset plans made\r\nwith the greatest care and thought, and lead to disastrous results.\r\n\r\nMassy could not have clearly understood the part he was meant to take\r\nin co-operation with Macpherson, for instead of following the route I\r\nhad directed him to take, he marched straight across country to the\r\nGhazni road, which brought him face to face with the enemy before he\r\ncould be joined by Macpherson. In his explanatory report Massy stated\r\nthat he had been misled by a memorandum[9] which he received from the\r\nAssistant Adjutant-General after his interview with me (although this\r\nmemorandum contained nothing contradictory of the orders I had given\r\nhim); that he understood from it that his business was to reach the\r\nGhazni road at its nearest point in the direction of Arghandeh, and\r\nthat he thought it better, with a thirty miles' march in prospect, to\r\ntake the most direct line in order to save his horses, to economize\r\ntime in a short December day, and to keep as near as he could to the\r\ncolumn with which he was to co-operate; further, he stated that he was\r\nunder the impression there was little likelihood of his meeting with\r\nany of the enemy nearer than Arghandeh.\r\n\r\nOn starting from Aushar Massy detached a troop of the 9th Lancers to\r\ncommunicate with Macpherson. This reduced his column to 247 British\r\nand 44 Native Cavalry, with 4 Horse Artillery guns.\r\n\r\nAs the party moved along the Chardeh valley, a loud beating of drums\r\nwas heard, and Captain Bloomfield Gough, 9th Lancers, commanding the\r\nadvance guard, perceived when he had moved to about a mile north of\r\nKila Kazi, that the enemy were occupying hills on both sides of the\r\nGhazni road, about two miles to his left front, and sent back word to\r\nthat effect. Massy, not believing that the Afghans had collected\r\nin any considerable numbers, continued to advance; but he was soon\r\nundeceived by the crowds of men and waving standards which shortly\r\ncame into view moving towards Kila Kazi. He then ordered Major\r\nSmith-Wyndham to open fire, but the range, 2,900 yards, being\r\nconsidered by Colonel Gordon, the senior Artillery officer, too far\r\nfor his six-pounders, after a few rounds the guns were moved across\r\nthe Ghazni road, and again brought into action at 2,500 yards; as this\r\ndistance was still found to be too great, they were moved to 2,000\r\nyards. The enemy now pressed forward on Massy's left flank, which was\r\nalso his line of retreat, and the guns had to be retired about a mile,\r\ncovered on the right and left by the 9th Lancers and the 14th Bengal\r\nLancers respectively, and followed so closely by the Afghans that when\r\nfire was next opened they were only 1,700 yards distant. Four Horse\r\nArtillery guns could do nothing against such numbers attacking without\r\nany regular formation, and when the leading men came within carbine\r\nrange, Massy tried to stop them by dismounting thirty of the 9th\r\nLancers; but their fire 'had no appreciable effect.'\r\n\r\nIt was at this critical moment that I appeared on the scene. Warned by\r\nthe firing that an engagement was taking place, I galloped across the\r\nChardeh valley as fast as my horse could carry me, and on gaining the\r\nopen ground beyond Bhagwana, an extraordinary spectacle was presented\r\nto my view. An unbroken line, extending for about two miles, and\r\nformed of not less than between 9,000 and 10,000 men, was moving\r\nrapidly towards me, all on foot save a small body of Cavalry on their\r\nleft flank--in fact, the greater part of Mahomed Jan's army. To meet\r\nthis formidable array, instead of Macpherson's and Massy's forces,\r\nwhich I hoped I should have found combined, there were but 4 guns, 198\r\nof the 9th Lancers under Lieutenant-Colonel Cleland, 40 of the 14th\r\nBengal Lancers under Captain Philip Neville, and at some little\r\ndistance Gough's troop of the 9th Lancers, who were engaged in\r\nwatching the enemy's Cavalry.\r\n\r\nThe inequality of the opposing forces was but too painfully apparent.\r\nThe first glance at the situation showed me the hopelessness of\r\ncontinuing the struggle without Infantry. Up to that moment our\r\ncasualties had not been many, as Afghans seldom play at long bowls, it\r\nbeing necessary for them to husband their ammunition, and when, as in\r\nthe present instance, they outnumber their adversaries by forty to\r\none, they universally try to come to close quarters and use their\r\nknives.\r\n\r\nMy first thought was how to secure the best and shortest line of\r\nretreat; it lay by Deh-i-Mazang, but in order to use it, the gorge\r\nclose by that village had to be held; for if the enemy reached it\r\nfirst they would have no difficulty in gaining the heights above\r\nKabul, which would practically place the city at their mercy.\r\n\r\nI was very anxious also to prevent any panic or disturbance taking\r\nplace in Kabul. I therefore told General Hills, who just\r\nthen opportunely joined me, to gallop to Sherpur, explain to\r\nBrigadier-General Hugh Gough, who had been placed in temporary\r\ncommand of that place, how matters stood, and order 200 of the 72nd\r\nHighlanders to come to Deh-i-Mazang with the least possible delay. I\r\ndirected Hills, after having delivered this message, to make for the\r\ncity, shut the gates, and do all in his power to keep the people\r\nquiet, while warning the Kizilbashes[10] to be prepared to defend\r\ntheir quarter. I then despatched my nephew and A.D.C., Lieutenant John\r\nSherston, to Macpherson to inform him of what had happened, and desire\r\nhim to push on with the utmost speed.\r\n\r\nHaving taken these precautionary measures, I sent another A.D.C.,\r\nCaptain Pole Carew, to Brigadier-General Massy to direct him to try\r\nand find a way by which the guns could retire in case of a necessity,\r\nwhich appeared to me to be only too probable.\r\n\r\nThe engagement had now become a question of time. If Mahomed Jan could\r\nclose with and overwhelm our small force, Kabul would be his; but if,\r\nby any possibility, his advance could be retarded until Macpherson\r\nshould come up, we might hope to retain possession of the city. It\r\nwas, therefore, to the Afghan leader's interest to press on, while it\r\nwas to ours to delay him as long as we possibly could.\r\n\r\nPole Carew presently returned with a message from Massy that the enemy\r\nwere close upon him, and that he could not keep them in check. I\r\ndesired Pole Carew to go back, order Massy to retire the guns, and\r\ncover the movement by a charge of Cavalry.\r\n\r\nThe charge was led by Lieutenant-Colonel Cleland and Captain Neville,\r\nthe former of whom fell dangerously wounded; but the ground, terraced\r\nfor irrigation purposes and intersected by nullas, so impeded\r\nour Cavalry that the charge, heroic as it was, made little or no\r\nimpression upon the overwhelming numbers of the enemy, now flushed\r\nwith the triumph of having forced our guns to retire. The effort,\r\nhowever, was worthy of the best traditions of our British and Indian\r\nCavalry, and that it failed in its object was no fault of our gallant\r\nsoldiers. To assist them in their extremity, I ordered two of\r\nSmyth-Windham's four guns to halt and come into action while the other\r\ntwo continued to retire, but these had not gone far before they got\r\ninto such difficult ground that one had to be spiked and abandoned in\r\na water-cut, where Smyth-Windham found it when he came up after\r\nhaving fired a few rounds at the fast advancing foe. I now ordered\r\nSmyth-Windham to make for the village of Bhagwana with his three\r\nremaining guns, as the only chance left of saving them. This he did,\r\nand having reached the village, he again opened fire from behind a\r\nlow wall which enclosed the houses; but the ammunition being nearly\r\nexpended, and the enemy close at hand, there was nothing for it but to\r\nlimber up again and continue the retirement through the village. At\r\nthe further side, however, and forming part of its defences, was a\r\nformidable obstacle in the shape of a ditch fully twelve feet deep,\r\nnarrowing towards the bottom; across this Smyth-Windham tried to take\r\nhis guns, and the leading horses had just begun to scramble up the\r\nfurther bank, when one of the wheelers stumbled and fell, with the\r\nresult that the shafts broke and the gun stuck fast, blocking the only\r\npoint at which there was any possibility of getting the others across.\r\n\r\nWith a faint hope of saving the guns, I directed Captain\r\nStewart-Mackenzie, who had assumed command of the 9th Lancers on\r\nCleland being disabled, to make a second charge, which he executed\r\nwith the utmost gallantry,[11] but to no purpose; and in the meanwhile\r\nSmyth-Windham had given the order to unhook and spike the guns.\r\n\r\nBy this time the enemy were within a few hundred yards of Bhagwana,\r\nand the inhabitants had begun to fire at us from the roofs of their\r\nhouses. I was endeavouring to help some men out of the ditch, when the\r\nheadman of the village rushed at me with his knife, seeing which, a\r\nMahomedan[12] of the 1st Bengal Cavalry, who was following me on foot,\r\nhaving just had his horse shot under him, sprang at my assailant, and,\r\nseizing him round the waist, threw him to the bottom of the ditch,\r\nthereby saving my life.[13]\r\n\r\nSuddenly the Afghans stayed their advance for a few minutes, thinking,\r\nas I afterwards learnt, that our Infantry were in the village--a\r\npause which allowed many of our Cavalry who had lost their horses to\r\nescape.[14]\r\n\r\nDirectly we had got clear of the village the Cavalry reformed, and\r\nretired slowly by alternate squadrons, in a manner which excited my\r\nhighest admiration, and reflected the greatest credit on the\r\nsoldierly qualities of Stewart-Mackenzie and Neville. From Bhagwana,\r\nDeh-i-Mazang was three miles distant, and it was of vital importance\r\nto keep the enemy back in order to give the Highlanders from Sherpur\r\ntime to reach the gorge.\r\n\r\nFor a time the Afghans continued to press on as before, but after a\r\nwhile their advance gradually became slower and their numbers somewhat\r\ndecreased. This change in Mahomed Jan's tactics, it afterwards turned\r\nout, was caused by Macpherson's advance guard coming into collision\r\nwith the rear portion of his army; it was of the greatest advantage\r\nto us, as it enabled the 72nd to arrive in time to bar the enemy's\r\npassage through the gorge. My relief was great when I beheld them,\r\nheaded by their eager Commander, Brownlow, doubling through the gap\r\nand occupying the village of Deh-i-Mazang and the heights on either\r\nside. The Cavalry greeted them with hearty cheers, and the volleys\r\ndelivered by the Highlanders from the roofs of the houses in the\r\nvillage soon checked the Afghans, some of whom turned back, while\r\nothers made for Indiki and the slopes of the Takht-i-Shah. For a time,\r\nat any rate, their hopes of getting possession of Kabul had been\r\nfrustrated.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the orders I sent to Macpherson on the 10th\r\nwere that he was to march very early the next morning, as Massy with\r\nthe Horse Artillery and Cavalry would leave Aushar at 9 a.m., and that\r\nhe must join him on the Arghandeh road. Macpherson did not make so\r\nearly a start as I had intended; from one cause or another, he said,\r\nhe was not able to leave Karez-i-Mir before eight o'clock. On reaching\r\nthe Surkh Kotal he observed dense bodies of the enemy hurrying from\r\nthe Paghman and Arghandeh directions towards Kila Kazi, and he pushed\r\non, hoping to be able to deal with them individually before they had\r\ntime to concentrate. For the first three miles from the foot of the\r\npass the view was obstructed by a range of hills, and nothing could be\r\nseen of the Horse Artillery and Cavalry; but soon after 10 a.m. the\r\nbooming of guns warned Macpherson that fighting was going on, but he\r\ncould not tell whether it was Baker's or Massy's troops which were\r\nengaged. He was, however, not left long in doubt, for Lieutenant\r\nNeville Chamberlain, attached to Macpherson as political officer, and\r\nwho had gone on with his advance guard, sent back word that he could\r\ndistinguish British Cavalry charging the Afghans, and as Baker had\r\nonly Native Cavalry with him, Macpherson knew at once that the action\r\nwas being fought by Massy. Suddenly the firing ceased, and he was\r\ninformed that the enemy were advancing on Kabul, and that their\r\nvanguard had already reached the belt of orchards and enclosures, on\r\nthe further fringe of which the smoke from our guns and the charge of\r\nour Cavalry had been seen.\r\n\r\nMacpherson, feeling that something serious had occurred, called on his\r\nmen to make a further effort. At 12.30 p.m., less than an hour after\r\nwe had begun to retire, he reached the ground where the fight had\r\ntaken place. The dead bodies of our officers and men, stripped and\r\nhorribly mutilated, proved how fierce had been the struggle, and\r\nthe dropping shots which came from the fortified villages in the\r\nneighbourhood and from the ravines, warned the Brigadier-General that\r\nsome of the enemy were still in the neighbourhood. But these men, so\r\nbold in the confidence of overwhelming numbers when attacking Massy's\r\nCavalry, were not prepared to withstand Macpherson's Infantry; after a\r\nbrief resistance they broke and fled in confusion, some to Indiki, but\r\nthe greater number to the shelter of the hills south of Kila Kazi, to\r\nwhich place Macpherson followed them, intending to halt there for the\r\nnight. This I did not allow him to do, for, seeing the heavy odds we\r\nhad opposed to us, and that the enemy were already in possession\r\nof the Takht-i-Shah, thus being in a position to threaten the Bala\r\nHissar, I sent orders to him to fall back upon Deh-i-Mazang, where he\r\narrived about 7 p.m.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Macpherson's baggage, with a guard of the 5th Gurkhas,\r\ncommanded by Major Cook, V.C., was attacked by some Afghans, who had\r\nremained concealed in the Paghman villages, and it would probably have\r\nfallen into their hands, as the Gurkhas were enormously outnumbered,\r\nbut for the timely arrival of four companies of the 3rd Sikhs, under\r\nMajor Griffiths, who had been left by Macpherson to see everything\r\nsafely down the pass. Cook himself was knocked over and stunned by\r\na blow, while his brother in the 3rd Sikhs received a severe\r\nbullet-wound close to his heart.\r\n\r\nDuring the retirement from Bhagwana, Macgregor, my Chief of the Staff,\r\nDurand, Badcock, and one or two other staff officers, got separated\r\nfrom me and were presently overtaken by an officer (Captain Gerald\r\nMartin), sent by Macpherson to tell Massy he was coming to his\r\nassistance as fast as his Infantry could travel; Martin informed\r\nMacgregor that as he rode by Bhagwana he had come across our abandoned\r\nguns, and that there was no enemy anywhere near them. On hearing this,\r\nMacgregor retraced his steps, and, assisted by the staff officers with\r\nhim and a few Horse Artillerymen and Lancers, and some Gurkhas of\r\nMacpherson's baggage guard picked up on the way, he managed to rescue\r\nthe guns and bring them into Sherpur that night. They had been\r\nstripped of all their movable parts, and the ammunition-boxes had been\r\nemptied; otherwise they were intact, and were fit for use the next\r\nday.\r\n\r\nI found assembled at Deh-i-Mazang Wali Mahomed and other Sirdars, who\r\nhad been watching with considerable anxiety the issue of the fight,\r\nfor they knew if the Afghans succeeded in their endeavours to enter\r\nKabul, all property belonging to people supposed to be friendly to us\r\nwould be plundered and their houses destroyed. I severely upbraided\r\nthese men for having misled me as to the strength and movements of\r\nMahomed Jan's army, and with having failed to fulfil their engagement\r\nto keep me in communication with Baker. They declared they had been\r\nmisinformed themselves, and were powerless in the matter. It was\r\ndifficult to believe that this was the case, and I was unwillingly\r\nforced to the conclusion that not a single Afghan could be trusted,\r\nhowever profuse he might be in his assurances of fidelity, and that we\r\nmust depend entirely on our own resources for intelligence.\r\n\r\nI waited at Deh-i-Mazang until Macpherson arrived, and thus did not\r\nget back to Sherpur till after dark. I was gratified on my arrival\r\nthere to find that Hugh Gough had made every arrangement that could be\r\ndesired for the defence of the cantonment, and that by his own\r\ncool and confident bearing he had kept the troops calm and steady,\r\nnotwithstanding the untoward appearance of some fugitives from the\r\nfield of battle, whose only too evident state of alarm might otherwise\r\nhave caused a panic.\r\n\r\nFor the safety of Sherpur I never for one moment had the smallest\r\napprehension during that eventful day. It was, I believe, thought by\r\nsome that if Mahomed Jan, instead of trying for the city, had made for\r\nthe cantonment, it would have fallen into his hands; but they were\r\naltogether wrong, for there were a sufficient number of men within the\r\nwalls to have prevented such a catastrophe had Mahomed Jan been in\r\na position to make an attack; but this, with Macpherson's brigade\r\nimmediately in his rear, he could never have dreamt of attempting.\r\n\r\nThe city of Kabul remained perfectly quiet while all the excitement\r\nI have described was going on outside. Hills, with a few Sikhs,\r\npatrolled the principal streets, and even when the Afghan standard\r\nappeared on the Takht-i-Shah there was no sign of disturbance.\r\nNevertheless, I thought it would be wise to withdraw from the city;\r\nI could not tell how long the people would remain well disposed,\r\nor whether they would assist us to keep the enemy out. I therefore\r\ndirected Hills to come away and make over his charge to an influential\r\nKizilbash named Futteh Khan. I also telegraphed to General Bright at\r\nJalalabad to reinforce Gandamak by a sufficient number of troops\r\nto hold that post in case it should be necessary to order\r\nBrigadier-General Charles Gough, who was then occupying it, to move\r\nhis brigade nearer to Kabul; for I felt sure that, unless I could\r\nsucceed in driving Mahomed Jan out of the neighbourhood of Kabul,\r\nexcitement would certainly spread along my line of communication.\r\nI concluded my message to Bright thus: 'If the wire should be cut,\r\nconsider it a bad sign, and push on to Gandamak, sending Gough's\r\nBrigade towards Kabul.'\r\n\r\nI could not help feeling somewhat depressed at the turn things had\r\ntaken. I had no news from Baker, and we had undoubtedly suffered a\r\nreverse, which I knew only too well would give confidence to the\r\nAfghans, who, from the footing they had now gained on the heights\r\nabove Kabul, threatened the Bala Hissar, which place, stored as it was\r\nwith powder and other material of war, I had found it necessary to\r\ncontinue to occupy. Nevertheless, reviewing the incidents of the 11th\r\nDecember, as I have frequently done since, with all the concomitant\r\ncircumstances deeply impressed on my memory, I have failed to discover\r\nthat any disposition of my force different from that I made could have\r\nhad better results, or that what did occur could have been averted\r\nby greater forethought or more careful calculation on my part. Two\r\ndeviations from my programme (which probably at the time appeared\r\nunimportant to the Commanders in question) were the principal factors\r\nin bringing about the unfortunate occurrences of that day. Had\r\nMacpherson marched at 7 a.m. instead of 8, and had Massy followed the\r\nroute I had arranged for him to take, Mahomed Jan must have fallen\r\ninto the trap I had prepared for him.\r\n\r\nOur casualties on the 11th were--killed, 4 British officers, 16\r\nBritish and 9 Native rank and file; wounded, 4 British officers, 1\r\nNative officer, 20 British and 10 Native rank and file.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKETCH SHOWING THE OPERATIONS IN THE CHARDEH\r\n    VALLEY ON DECEMBER 10TH AND 11TH, 1879]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Fragrance of the universe.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Viz., Logar, Zurmat, the Mangal and Jadran districts, and\r\nthe intervening Ghilzai country.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Kohistan.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Maidan and Ghazni.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Macpherson had with him the following troops: 4 guns\r\nR.H.A.; 4 guns Mountain battery; 1 squadron 9th Lancers; 2 squadrons\r\n14th Bengal Lancers; 401 rifles 67th Foot; 509 rifles 3rd Sikhs; 393\r\nrifles 5th Ghurkas.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Baker's column consisted of: 4 guns Mountain battery;\r\n3 troops 5th Punjab Cavalry; 25 Sappers and Miners; 450 rifles 92nd\r\nHighlanders; 450 rifles 5th Punjab Infantry.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Now Lieutenant-General Sir William Lockhart, K.C.B.,\r\nK.C.S.I.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: On the 11th December, the troops at and around Kabul\r\namounted to 6,352 men and 20 guns, which were thus disposed:\r\n\r\n                                                _Men._     _Guns._\r\n  Baker's column                                1,325         4\r\n  Macpherson's column                           1,492         4\r\n  Massy's column                                  351         4\r\n  At Sherpur                                    3,184         8\r\n                                                -----        --\r\n                                                6,352        20\r\n  There were besides at Butkhak and Lataband    1,343         2\r\n  And the Guides Corps, which reached Sherpur}\r\n  on the evening of the 11th December        }    679\r\n                                                -----        --\r\n                       Total                    8,374        22]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: The memorandum was as follows:\r\n\r\n    'Brigadier-General Massy will start at eight a.m. to-morrow with a\r\n    squadron of Cavalry, join the Cavalry and Horse Artillery now\r\n    out under Colonel Gordon, taking command thereof, and operating\r\n    towards Arghandeh in conjunction with Brigadier-General\r\n    Macpherson.

Adams, however, managed to support the Lancer until\r\nhe was able to make him over to some of his own comrades.\r\n\r\nAdams rejoined me in time to assist two more of the 9th who were\r\nstruggling under their horses at the bottom of the ditch. Without a\r\nmoment's hesitation, Adams jumped into the ditch. He was an unusually\r\npowerful man, and by sheer strength dragged the Lancers clear of their\r\nhorses. The Afghans meanwhile had reached Bhagwana, and were so close\r\nto the ditch that I thought my friend the padre could not possibly\r\nescape. I called out to him to look after himself, but he paid no\r\nattention to my warnings until he had pulled the almost exhausted\r\nLancers to the top of the slippery bank. Adams received the Victoria\r\nCross for his conduct on this occasion.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: These men were much impeded by their long boots and\r\ntheir swords dangling between their legs; the sight, indeed, of\r\nCavalry soldiers trying to defend themselves on foot without a firearm\r\nconfirmed the opinion I had formed during the Mutiny, as to the\r\ndesirability for the carbine being slung on the man's back when going\r\ninto action. Lieutenant-Colonel Bushman (Colonel Cleland's successor)\r\ncuriously enough had brought with him from England a sling which\r\nadmitted of this being done, and also of the carbine being carried in\r\nthe bucket on all ordinary occasions. This pattern was adopted, and\r\nduring the remainder of the campaign the men of the 9th Lancers placed\r\ntheir carbines on their backs whenever the enemy were reported to\r\nbe in sight. At the same time I authorized the adoption of an\r\narrangement--also brought to my notice by Colonel Bushman--by which\r\nthe sword was fastened to the saddle instead of round the man's body.\r\nThis mode of wearing the sword was for some time strenuously opposed\r\nin this country, but its utility could not fail to be recognized, and\r\nin 1891 an order was issued sanctioning its adoption by all mounted\r\ntroops.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n1879\r\n\r\n  Attack on the Takht-i-Shah--City people join the tribesmen\r\n  --Increasing numbers of the enemy--Loss of the conical hill\r\n  --Captain Vousden's gallantry--The retirement to Sherpur\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 12th I was cheered by hearing that the Guides\r\nhad arrived during the night under the command of Colonel P.\r\nJenkins--a most welcome reinforcement, for I knew how thoroughly to be\r\ndepended upon was every man in that distinguished corps.\r\n\r\nThe first thing now to be done was to endeavour to drive the Afghans\r\nfrom the crest of the Takht-i-Shah; and I directed Macpherson, as soon\r\nas his men had breakfasted, to attack the position from Deh-i-Mazang.\r\nJust then my mind was considerably relieved by a heliogram from Baker\r\ninforming me that he was on his way back to Kabul. The message was\r\ndespatched from near Kila Kazi, within four miles of which place Baker\r\nhad encamped on the afternoon of the previous day.\r\n\r\nMacpherson deputed the task of trying to dislodge the enemy to\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Money, of the 3rd Sikhs, with a detachment\r\nconsisting of 2 Mountain guns and 560 British and Native Infantry.\r\n\r\nIt was a most formidable position to attack. The slopes leading up\r\nto it were covered with huge masses of jagged rock, intersected by\r\nperpendicular cliffs, and its natural great strength was increased by\r\nbreastworks, and stockades thrown up at different points.\r\n\r\nAfter a gallant and persistent attempt had been made, I ordered the\r\nassault to be deferred; for I perceived that the enemy were being\r\nreinforced from their rear, and to ensure success without great loss,\r\nit would be necessary to attack them in rear as well as in the\r\nfront. The arrival of Baker's brigade made it possible to do this. I\r\ntherefore ordered Macpherson to hold the ground of which he had gained\r\npossession until Baker could co-operate with him next morning from the\r\nBeni Hissar side.\r\n\r\nDuring the night Mahomed Jan, who had been joined by several thousands\r\nfrom Logar and Wardak, occupied the villages situated between Beni\r\nHissar and the Bala Hissar and along the _sang-i-nawishta_ road.\r\nBaker, who started at 8 a.m. on the 13th,[1] had, therefore, in the\r\nfirst place, to gain the high ground above these villages, and, while\r\nholding the point over-looking Beni Hissar, to wheel to his right and\r\nmove towards the Takht-i-Shah.\r\n\r\nWhen he had proceeded some little distance, his advance guard reported\r\nthat large bodies of the enemy were moving up the slope of the ridge\r\nfrom the villages near Beni Hissar. To check this movement, and\r\nprevent the already very difficult Afghan position being still further\r\nstrengthened, Major White, who was in command of the leading portion\r\nof the attacking party, turned and made for the nearest point on the\r\nridge. It was now a race between the Highlanders and the Afghans as to\r\nwho should gain the crest of the ridge first. The Artillery came into\r\naction at a range of 1,200 yards, and under cover of their fire the\r\n92nd, supported by the Guides, rushed up the steep slopes. They were\r\nmet by a furious onslaught, and a desperate conflict took place.\r\nThe leading officer, Lieutenant Forbes, a lad of great promise, was\r\nkilled, and Colour-Sergeant Drummond fell by his side. For a moment\r\neven the brave Highlanders were staggered by the numbers and fury of\r\ntheir antagonists, but only for a moment. Lieutenant Dick Cunyngham[2]\r\nsprang forward to cheer them on, and confidence was restored. With\r\na wild shout the Highlanders threw themselves on the Afghans, and\r\nquickly succeeded in driving them down the further side of the ridge.\r\n\r\nBy this successful movement the enemy's line was cut in two, and while\r\nthe Cavalry and a party of the 3rd Sikhs prevented their rallying in\r\nthe direction of Beni Hissar, the 92nd and Guides, protected by the\r\nMountain guns, which had been got on to the ridge, and the Field\r\nArtillery from below, advanced towards the Takht-i-Shah. The Afghans\r\ndisputed every inch of the way, but by 11.30 a.m. White's men had\r\nreached the foot of the craggy eminence which formed the enemy's main\r\nposition. They were here joined by some of the 72nd Highlanders, 3rd\r\nSikhs, and 5th Gurkhas, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Money,\r\nwho had fought their way from the upper Bala Hissar.\r\n\r\nA brilliant charge by the combined troops now took place, the two\r\nHighlands corps vying with each other for the honour of reaching the\r\nsummit first. It fell to the 72nd, Colour-Sergeant Yule[3] of that\r\nregiment being the foremost man on the top. The enemy made a most\r\ndetermined stand, and it was only after a severe struggle and heavy\r\nloss that they were driven off the heights.\r\n\r\nFrom my position at Sherpur I had the satisfaction of witnessing this\r\nsuccess. This satisfaction, however, was short-lived, for almost\r\nimmediately I received a report from the city that the inhabitants had\r\njoined the tribesmen, and that the cantonment was being threatened;\r\nindeed, I could see large bodies of armed men emerging from the city\r\nand moving towards Siah Sang, whence the road between the Bala Hissar\r\nand Sherpur would be commanded.\r\n\r\nHaving only too evidently lost control over the city, the value of\r\nDeh-i-Mazang was gone, so I ordered Macpherson to abandon it and move\r\nto the Shahr-i-Darwaza heights, taking with him six companies of the\r\n67th Foot for the protection of the Bala Hissar, to which it was\r\ndesirable to hold on as long as possible. The remainder of his troops\r\nI ordered to be sent to Sherpur. To Baker I signalled to leave a\r\nparty on the Takht-i-Shah under Lieutenant-Colonel Money, and to move\r\nhimself towards the cantonment with the rest of his troops, driving\r\nthe enemy off the Siah Sang on the way.\r\n\r\nBut from his point of vantage on the heights Baker could see, what\r\nI could not, that the Afghans had occupied two strongly fortified\r\nvillages between Siah Sang and the Bala Hissar, from which it was\r\nnecessary to dislodge them in the first instance, and for this service\r\nhe detached the 5th Punjab Infantry and a battery of Artillery. It\r\nwas carried out in a masterly manner by Major Pratt, who soon gained\r\npossession of one village. The other, however, was resolutely held,\r\nand the Artillery failing to effect a breach, the gates were set on\r\nfire; but even then a satisfactory opening was not made, and the place\r\nwas eventually captured by means of scaling-ladders hastily made of\r\npoles tied together with the Native soldiers' turbans.\r\n\r\nBaker was now able to turn his attention to Siah Sang, so I despatched\r\nthe Cavalry under Massy, to act with him when a signal success was\r\nachieved. The enemy fought stubbornly, but were at last driven off.\r\nThe 5th Punjab Cavalry, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Williams and Major\r\nHammond, greatly distinguished themselves, and a grand charge was made\r\nby the Guides and 9th Lancers, in which Captain Butson, of the latter\r\nregiment, was killed, also the troop Sergeant-Major and 3 men; and\r\nCaptain Chisholme,[4] Lieutenant Trower, and 8 men were wounded.\r\n\r\nThis ended the operations on the 13th. Our losses during the day were:\r\nkilled, 2 British officers and 12 men; wounded, 2 British officers and\r\n43 men, British and Native.\r\n\r\nI was in great hopes that our successes and the heavy losses the enemy\r\nhad sustained would result in the breaking up of the combination\r\nagainst us; but in case these hopes should not be realized, I\r\ndecided to do away with some of the smaller posts on the line of\r\ncommunication, and order up more troops. Accordingly, I telegraphed to\r\nGeneral Bright to send on Charles Gough's brigade, and I directed the\r\ndetachment at Butkhak to return to Kabul, and that at Seh Baba to fall\r\nback on Lataband. Having great confidence in its Commander, Colonel\r\nHudson, I determined to hold on to Lataband for a time, though by\r\nso doing the numbers I might otherwise have had at Sherpur were\r\nconsiderably diminished. Lataband was the most important link in the\r\nchain of communication between Kabul and Jalalabad; it was in direct\r\nheliographic connexion with Kabul; it had sufficient ammunition\r\nand supplies to last over the date on which Gough should arrive at\r\nSherpur, and its being held would be a check on the Ghilzais, and\r\nprevent his encountering any serious opposition. At the same time, I\r\ncould not disguise from myself that there was a certain amount of risk\r\nattached to leaving so small a garrison in this somewhat isolated\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThe night of the 13th passed quietly, but when day dawned on the 14th\r\ncrowds of armed men, with numerous standards, could be seen occupying\r\na hill on the Kohistan road; and as day advanced they proceeded in\r\nvast numbers to the Asmai heights, where they were joined by swarms\r\nfrom the city and the Chardeh valley. It then became apparent that the\r\ncombination was much more formidable than I had imagined, and that the\r\nnumbers of the enemy now in opposition to us were far greater than I\r\nhad dreamt was possible. Foiled in their attempt to close in upon us\r\nfrom the south and west, the tribesmen had concentrated to the north,\r\nand it was evident they were preparing to deliver an attack in great\r\nstrength from that quarter. I quickly decided to drive the enemy off\r\nthe Asmai heights, to cut their communication with Kohistan, and to\r\noperate towards the north, much as I had operated the previous day to\r\nthe south of Sherpur.\r\n\r\nAt 9 a.m. I despatched Brigadier General Baker to the eastern slope of\r\nthe Asmai range with the following troops: 4 guns, Field Artillery; 4\r\nguns, Mountain Artillery; 14th Bengal Lancers; 72nd Highlanders (192\r\nrifles); 92nd Highlanders (100 rifles); Guides Infantry (460 rifles);\r\nand 5th Punjab Infantry (470 rifles).\r\n\r\nCovered by the fire of his Artillery, Baker seized the conical hill\r\nwhich formed the northern boundary of the Aliabad Kotal, thus placing\r\nhimself on the enemy's line of communication, and preventing them\r\nfrom being reinforced. He then proceeded to attack the Asmai heights,\r\nleaving 2 Mountain guns, 64 men of the 72nd, and 60 Guides, under the\r\ncommand of Lieutenant-Colonel W.H. Clarke, to hold the hill.\r\n\r\nTo aid Baker in his difficult task, I brought four guns into action\r\nnear the north-west corner of the cantonment, and I signalled to\r\nMacpherson to give him every possible assistance. Macpherson at once\r\nsent the 67th across the Kabul river to threaten the enemy's left\r\nrear; while the marksmen of the regiment and the Mountain guns opened\r\nfire from the northern slope of the Bala Hissar heights.\r\n\r\nThe enemy fought with the greatest obstinacy, but eventually our\r\ntroops reached the top of the hill, where, on the highest point, a\r\nnumber of _ghazis_ had taken their stand, determined to sell their\r\nlives dearly.\r\n\r\nAll this I eagerly watched from my place of observation. There was a\r\nfierce struggle, and then, to my intense relief, I saw our men on the\r\ntopmost pinnacle, and I knew the position was gained.\r\n\r\nIt was now a little past noon, and I was becoming anxious about the\r\nparty left on the conical hill, as Macpherson had heliographed that\r\nvery large bodies of Afghans were moving northwards from Indiki, with\r\nthe intention, apparently, of effecting a junction with the tribesmen\r\nwho were occupying the hills in the Kohistan direction. I therefore\r\nsignalled to Baker to leave the 67th in charge of the Asmai heights,\r\nand himself return to the lower ridge, giving him my reasons.\r\n\r\nBaker at once despatched a detachment of the 5th Punjab Infantry,\r\nunder Captain Hall, to reinforce Clarke, who I could see might soon be\r\nhard pressed, and I sent 200 rifles of the 3rd Sikhs (the only troops\r\navailable at the moment) to his assistance.\r\n\r\nI watched what was taking place on the conical hill through my\r\ntelescope, and was startled to perceive that the enemy were, unnoticed\r\nby him, creeping close up to Clarke's position. I could just see a\r\nlong Afghan knife appear above the ridge, steadily mounting higher and\r\nhigher, the bearer of which was being concealed by the contour of the\r\nhill, and I knew it was only one of the many weapons which were being\r\ncarried by our enemies to the attack. The reinforcements were still\r\nsome distance off, and my heart sank within me, for I felt convinced\r\nthat after our recent victories the Afghans would never venture to\r\ncross the open and attack British soldiers unless an overwhelming\r\nsuperiority of numbers made success appear to them a certainty. Next I\r\nheard the boom of guns and the rattle of musketry, and a minute or two\r\nlater (which, in my anxiety, seemed an eternity to me), I only too\r\nplainly saw our men retreating down the hill, closely followed by the\r\nenemy. The retirement was being conducted steadily and slowly, but\r\nfrom that moment I realized, what is hard for a British soldier,\r\nhow much harder for a British commander, to realize, that we were\r\nover-matched, and that we could not hold our ground.\r\n\r\nClarke,[5] as well as every man with him, fought splendidly; the\r\nAfghans by force of numbers alone made themselves masters of the\r\nposition and captured two guns.[6]\r\n\r\nWhile all that I have described was going on, the enemy began to\r\ncollect again on Siah Sang, and to make their way round the eastern\r\nflank of the cantonment towards Kohistan.\r\n\r\nI had sent orders in the morning to Lieutenant-Colonel Williams, who\r\nwas quartered with his regiment (the 5th Punjab Cavalry) in the King's\r\nGarden, between Sherpur and the city, to be on the look-out, and not\r\nto allow any of the enemy to pass in that direction. About 1 p.m. some\r\n400 Afghans were observed moving along the left bank of the river:\r\nthese were met by Captain Vousden of the same regiment, who with one\r\ntroop was employed in reconnoitring; he most gallantly charged\r\nin amongst them with only twelve of his men, the remainder being\r\neffectually stopped by a heavy fire opened upon them from behind a\r\nlow wall. Vousden succeeded in dispersing these heavy odds, and in\r\ninflicting severe loss upon them--a very brilliant service, for which\r\nhe received the Victoria Cross.\r\n\r\nMy object throughout these operations had been, as I hope I have\r\nmade clear, to break up the combination by dealing with the enemy in\r\ndetail, and preventing them getting possession of the city and the\r\nBala Hissar.\r\n\r\nUp till noon on the 14th I had no idea of the extraordinary numbers\r\nthey were able to bring together, and I had no reason to believe that\r\nit would be possible for them to cope with disciplined troops; but\r\nthe manner in which the conical hill had been retaken gave me a\r\nmore correct idea of their strength and determination, and shook my\r\nconfidence in the ability of my comparatively small force to resist\r\nthe ever-increasing hordes, on ground which gave every advantage to\r\nnumerical superiority. It was a bitter thought that it might be my\r\nduty to retire for a time within the defences of Sherpur, a measure\r\nwhich would involve the abandonment of the city and the Bala Hissar,\r\nand which I knew, moreover, would give heart to the tribesmen.\r\n\r\nI had to decide at once on the course I ought to pursue, for, if I\r\ncontinued to act on the defensive, food and ammunition must be sent\r\nbefore dark to Macpherson's brigade, occupying the hills above the\r\ncity, and arrangements must be made for Baker's retention of the Asmai\r\nheights. I heliographed to Macpherson to inquire the direction in\r\nwhich the enemy were moving, and whether their numbers were still\r\nincreasing. He replied that large masses were steadily advancing\r\nfrom north, south, and west, and that their numbers were momentarily\r\nbecoming greater, to which the young officer in charge of the\r\nsignalling station added, 'The crowds of Afghans in the Chardeh valley\r\nremind me of Epsom on the Derby day.'\r\n\r\nThis decided me; I determined to withdraw from all isolated positions,\r\nand concentrate my force at Sherpur, thereby securing the safety of\r\nthe cantonment and avoiding what had now become a useless sacrifice of\r\nlife. I only too thoroughly recognized the evils of the measure, but I\r\nconsidered that no other course would be justifiable, and that I must\r\nact for the present entirely on the defensive, and wait until the\r\ngrowing confidence of the enemy should afford me a favourable\r\nopportunity for attacking them, or until reinforcements could arrive.\r\n\r\nThe inevitable order reached the two Generals at 2 p.m., and the\r\nretirement was begun at once. The Afghans speedily discovered the\r\nretrograde movement, and no sooner had each post in its turn been\r\nevacuated than it was occupied by the enemy, who pressed our troops\r\nthe whole way back to the cantonment. There was hand-to-hand fighting,\r\nand many splendid acts of courage were performed, Major Hammond, of\r\nthe Guides, earning the Victoria Cross; but throughout there was no\r\nhurry or confusion, all was conducted with admirable coolness and\r\nskill, and shortly after dark the troops and baggage were safe inside\r\nSherpur. That night the Afghans occupied the city and the Bala Hissar.\r\n\r\nIt is comparatively easy for a small body of well-trained soldiers,\r\nsuch as those of which the army in India is composed, to act on the\r\noffensive against Asiatics, however powerful they may be in point of\r\nnumbers. There is something in the determined advance of a compact,\r\ndisciplined body of troops which they can seldom resist. But a\r\nretirement is a different matter. They become full of confidence and\r\nvalour the moment they see any signs of their opponents being unable\r\nto resist them, and if there is the smallest symptom of unsteadiness,\r\nwavering, or confusion, a disaster is certain to occur. It may be\r\nimagined, therefore, with what intense anxiety I watched for hours\r\nthe withdrawal. The ground was all in favour of the Afghans, who,\r\nunimpeded by impedimenta of any kind, swarmed down upon the mere\r\nhandful of men retreating before them, shouting cries of victory and\r\nbrandishing their long knives; but our brave men, inspired by the\r\nundaunted bearing of their officers, were absolutely steady. They took\r\nup position after position with perfect coolness; every movement was\r\ncarried out with as much precision as if they were manoeuvring on\r\nan ordinary field-day; and the killed and wounded were brought away\r\nwithout the slightest hurry or confusion. In fact, the whole of the\r\nhazardous operation was most successfully and admirably carried out;\r\nand as each regiment and detachment filed through the Head-Quarters\r\ngateway I was able to offer my warm congratulations and heartfelt\r\nthanks to my gallant comrades.\r\n\r\nOur losses during the day were: 19 killed, including Captain Spens and\r\nLieutenant Gaisford, 72nd Highlanders, and 88 wounded, amongst whom\r\nwere Captain Gordon, 92nd Highlanders, Lieutenant Egerton, 72nd\r\nHighlanders, and Captain Battye, of the Guides.[7]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: His force consisted of 4 guns, Field Artillery; 4\r\nMountain guns; 1 squadron 9th Lancers; 5th Punjab Cavalry; 6 companies\r\n92nd Highlanders; 7 companies Guides; and 300 3rd Sikhs; and\r\nsubsequently it was strengthened by 150 of the 5th Punjab Infantry.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Dick Cunyngham received the Victoria Cross for\r\nconspicuous gallantry and coolness on this occasion.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: This gallant non-commissioned officer was killed the\r\nfollowing day.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Notwithstanding that his wound was most severe, Captain\r\nChisholme remained in the saddle, and brought the regiment out of\r\naction.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Clarke never recovered the loss of this post. He and I\r\nhad been cadets together at Sandhurst, and I often visited him while\r\nhe was in hospital at Sherpur. He was apparently suffering from no\r\ndisease, but gradually faded away, and died not long after he reached\r\nIndia.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: General Baker, in his despatch, stated that 'No blame for\r\nthe loss of these guns is in any way to be attached to the officers\r\nand men of No. 2 Mountain Battery.... Every credit is due to Captain\r\nSwinley, the late Lieutenant Montanaro, and Lieutenant Liddell,\r\nand the several Native officers, non-commissioned officers and men\r\ncomposing the gun detachments, for the gallant manner in which they\r\nstood to their guns to the last, and it was only on the sudden rush of\r\nthis overwhelming force of the enemy that they had to retire with the\r\nloss of two guns.'\r\n\r\nOf the men composing the gun detachments, one was killed and six\r\nwounded, and Surgeon-Major Joshua Duke was specially mentioned for his\r\nattention to the wounded under heavy fire.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The same officer who so gallantly met his death during\r\nthe recent Chitral campaign, while commanding the regiment of which he\r\nwas so justly proud, and in which two brave brothers had been killed\r\nbefore him--Quinton at Delhi, and Wigram during the first phase of the\r\nAfghan war.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n1879\r\n\r\n  Sherpur--Defence of Sherpur--Arrest of Daud Shah\r\n  --Rumours of an assault--Attack and counter-attack\r\n  --Communication with India re-opened--Sherpur made safe\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moment the gates were closed I telegraphed the result of the day's\r\noperations to the Viceroy and Commander-in-Chief, for I knew that the\r\nenemy's first thought would be to stop communication with India\r\nby cutting the telegraph-wires. I reported that I had ordered\r\nBrigadier-General Charles Gough's brigade to push on from Gandamak as\r\nfast as possible; and I recommended that General Bright should have\r\nmore troops sent up to him, to allow of his keeping open the route to\r\nKabul, and of his reinforcing me should I find it impossible to clear\r\nthe country with the force at my disposal. It was a satisfaction to\r\nbe able to assure the authorities in these, to me, otherwise painful\r\ntelegrams, that there was no cause for anxiety as to the safety of the\r\ntroops; that sufficient supplies for men were stored in Sherpur for\r\nnearly four months, and for animals for six weeks; that there\r\nwas abundance of firewood, medicines, and hospital comforts, and\r\nsufficient ammunition both for guns and rifles to admit of an active\r\nresistance being carried on for between three and four months.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate there was no lack of provisions, for our numbers were\r\nconsiderably increased by the presence of Wali Mahomed Khan and many\r\nother Sirdars, who begged for shelter in Sherpur, on the plea that\r\ntheir lives would not be safe were they to return to the city. They\r\nwere far from being welcome guests, for I could not trust them;\r\nostensibly, however, they were our friends, and I could not refuse\r\ntheir petition. I therefore admitted them, on condition that each\r\nSirdar should only be accompanied by a specified number of followers.\r\n\r\nThe stormy occurrences of the 14th were succeeded by a period of\r\ncomparative calm, during which the entrenchments were strengthened,\r\nand the heavy guns found in the Kabul arsenal were prepared for\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe great drawback to Sherpur, as I have already mentioned, was its\r\nextent and the impossibility of reducing the line of defences owing to\r\nthe length of the Bimaru ridge. The cantonment was in the form of a\r\nparallelogram, with the Bimaru heights running along, and protecting,\r\nthe northern side. Between this range and the hills, which form the\r\nsouthern boundary of Kohistan, lay a lake, or rather _jhil_, a barrier\r\nbetween which and the commanding Bimaru ridge no enemy would dare to\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nThe massive wall on the south and west faces was twenty feet high,\r\ncovered at a distance of thirty feet by a lower wall fifteen feet\r\nhigh; the southern wall was pierced at intervals of about 700 yards by\r\ngateways, three in number, protected by lofty circular bastions, and\r\nbetween these and at the four corners were a series of low bastions\r\nwhich gave an admirable flanking fire. The wall on the western flank\r\nwas of similar construction, but had been considerably damaged at the\r\nnorthern end, evidently by an explosion of gunpowder.\r\n\r\nThe weak part of our defence was on the eastern face, where the wall,\r\nwhich had never been completed, was only seven feet high, and did not\r\nextend for more than 700 yards from the south-east corner; the line\r\nthen ran to the north-west, and, skirting the village of Bimaru, ended\r\nat the foot of the ridge.\r\n\r\nFrom this description it will be seen that, though the perimeter[1]\r\nof Sherpur was rather too large for a force of 7,000 effective men to\r\ndefend, its powers of resistance, both natural and artificial, were\r\nconsiderable. It was absolutely necessary to hold the Bimaru ridge for\r\nits entire length; to have given up any part of it would have been to\r\nrepeat the mistake which proved so disastrous to Elphinstone's army in\r\n1841. In fact, the Bimaru heights were at once the strength and the\r\nweakness of the position. So long as we could hold the heights we were\r\nsafe from attack from the north; but if we had been forced, either\r\nfrom the weakness of our own garrison, or from any other cause, to\r\nrelinquish the command of this natural barrier, the whole of the\r\ncantonment must have lain open to the enemy, and must forthwith have\r\nbecome untenable.\r\n\r\nThe question of how Sherpur could best be defended had been carefully\r\nconsidered by a committee,[2] assembled by my orders soon after\r\nour arrival in Kabul; and a scheme had been drawn up detailing the\r\nmeasures which should be adopted in case of attack.\r\n\r\nOn the recommendation of this committee six towers had been\r\nconstructed on the Bimaru heights, and shelter trenches and gunpits\r\nmade at the points where Infantry and Artillery fire could be used\r\nwith the greatest advantage. These trenches were now deepened and\r\nprolonged, so as to form one continuous line of defence, protected by\r\nan abattis; and the defences in the depression between the heights\r\nwere so arranged that fire could be brought to bear on an enemy\r\nadvancing from the north. To strengthen the north-east corner, a\r\nbattery was thrown up on the slope of the ridge, which was connected\r\nwith the tower above and the village below. The village itself was\r\nloop-holed, the outlying buildings to the front made defensible,\r\nand the open space to the north-east secured by abattis and wire\r\nentanglements. The Native Field Hospital was strengthened in like\r\nmanner, and sand-bag parapets were piled upon the roof, which was\r\nsomewhat exposed.\r\n\r\nThe unfinished wall on the eastern face was raised by logs of wood,\r\nand abattis and wire entanglements were placed in front. In the open\r\nspace lying between the Bimaru ridge and the north-west circular\r\nbastion, a defence on the _laager_ system was constructed out of\r\ngun-carriages and limbers captured from the enemy; while the village\r\nof Ghulam Hasan Khan, which formed an excellent flanking defence along\r\nthe northern and western faces, was held as an independent post.\r\n\r\nI divided the whole of the defences into five sections, under the\r\nsuperintendence of five different commanders: Brigadier-General\r\nMacpherson, Colonel Jenkins, Brigadier-General Hugh Gough,\r\nMajor-General Hills, and Colonel Brownlow. Brigadier-General Massy was\r\ngiven the centre of the cantonment, where were collected the forage\r\nand firewood; and Brigadier-General Baker commanded the reserve, which\r\nwas formed up at the depression in the Bimaru heights mentioned above,\r\nthat he might be able to move rapidly to either end of the ridge, the\r\nweakest points in our defences.\r\n\r\nThe several sections were connected with each other and with my\r\nHead-Quarters by a telegraph-wire, and visual signalling was\r\nestablished at all important points.\r\n\r\nIn my arrangements for the defence of Sherpur I relied to a great\r\nextent on the advice of my accomplished Chief Engineer, Colonel Æneas\r\nPerkins, and it was mainly owing to him, and to the exertions of\r\nhis competent staff, that the work was carried on as rapidly and\r\nsatisfactorily as it was.\r\n\r\nDuring these days of preparation the enemy remained comparatively\r\ninactive, being chiefly employed in looting the city and emptying the\r\nAmir's arsenal. The gunpowder had been destroyed as far as possible;\r\nbut a great deal still remained, and many tons of it were carried off\r\nby the army of Mahomed Jan, who had now become the practical leader of\r\nthe Afghan combination, and had lately proclaimed Yakub Khan's eldest\r\nson, Musa Khan, Amir.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 16th I received the welcome news that Colonel\r\nHudson had successfully resisted an attack on his position by the\r\nGhilzais--welcome because I could now feel assured that Lataband could\r\nbe depended upon to hold its own.\r\n\r\nFor the next five days nothing of much importance was done on either\r\nside. The enemy took up positions daily in the neighbouring forts and\r\ngardens, causing a few casualties, and some of our troops moved out to\r\ndislodge them from those places from which they could specially annoy\r\nus. I destroyed some of the forts, and removed other cover in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the walls; but I did not undertake any large\r\nsorties, for to have attempted to drive the enemy out of the outlying\r\nposts, which I could not then have held, would have been a useless\r\nwaste of strength.\r\n\r\nMy chief trouble at this time was the presence of the Afghan Sirdars\r\nwithin the cantonment. I had good reason to believe that some of them,\r\nthough full of protestations of friendship, had been in communication\r\nwith Mahomed Jan, the high-priest Mushk-i-Alam, and other Afghan\r\nleaders, so that I felt sure that neither they nor their followers\r\nwere to be depended upon. I was also somewhat anxious about the Pathan\r\nsoldiers in our ranks, a feeling which I was unwilling to acknowledge\r\neven to myself, for they had hitherto behaved with marked loyalty,\r\nand done splendid service; but they were now being exposed to a most\r\nsevere trial, in that they were, as I knew, being constantly appealed\r\nto by their co-religionists to join in the _jahad_ against us, and\r\nbitterly reproached for serving their infidel masters. Whether they\r\nwould be strong enough to resist such appeals, it was impossible to\r\ntell; but it would have been most unwise, as well as most painful\r\nto me, to show the slightest suspicion of these fine soldiers. It\r\nhappened that the Corps of Guides and 5th Punjab Infantry, which had\r\nof all regiments the largest number of Mahomedans amongst them, were\r\nlocated at the two extremities of the Bimaru range, the points most\r\nlikely to be attacked; to have made any change in the disposition\r\nwould have been to show that they were suspected, so I determined\r\n(after taking their commanding officers, Colonels Jenkins and McQueen,\r\ninto my confidence) to leave them where they were, and merely to\r\nstrengthen each post by a couple of companies of Highlanders.\r\n\r\nI was also considerably exercised about the safety of the large stacks\r\nof firewood, grain, and forage, for if anything had happened to them\r\nwe could not have continued to hold Sherpur. There were not enough\r\nBritish soldiers to furnish guards for these stacks, so I was obliged\r\nto have them watched for a time by officers; an opportune fall of\r\nsnow, however, on the night of the 18th, rendered incendiarism\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nOne other extremely unpleasant precaution I felt it my duty to take\r\nwas the placing of Daud Shah, Yakub Khan's Commander-in-Chief, under\r\narrest. I liked the man, and he had mixed freely with us all for more\r\nthan two months. He was not, however, absolutely above suspicion: some\r\nof his near relatives were the most prominent amongst our enemies; and\r\nI had been struck by a change in his manner towards me of late. In\r\ntrusting him to the extent I had done, I acted against the opinion of\r\nalmost everyone about me, and now that I had a doubt myself, I felt I\r\nwas not justified in leaving him at liberty, for if he were disposed\r\nto make use of his opportunities to our disadvantage, his unrestrained\r\nfreedom of movement and observation would be certainly a source of\r\ngreat danger.\r\n\r\nFor three or four days cloudy weather prevented heliograph\r\ncommunication with Lataband, and messengers sent by Hudson had failed\r\nto reach Sherpur, so that we were without any news from the outer\r\nworld; but on the afternoon of the 18th I received a letter from\r\nBrigadier-General Charles Gough, conveying the disappointing\r\nintelligence that he had only got as far as Jagdalak, twenty-one miles\r\nfrom Gandamak, and that he did not consider himself strong enough to\r\nadvance on Kabul.\r\n\r\nGough no doubt felt himself in an awkward position. The line to his\r\nrear was weakly held, the telegraph-wire on both sides of him was\r\ncut, his rear guard had been attacked near Jagdalak, there was a\r\nconsiderable collection of men on the hills to his front, and, as he\r\nreported, 'the whole country was up.' Moreover, Major-General Bright,\r\nunder whom Gough was immediately serving, shared his opinion that it\r\nwould be wiser for him to wait until reinforcements came up from the\r\nrear.\r\n\r\nGough, however, had with him 4 Mountain guns and 125 Artillerymen, 73\r\nSappers and Miners, 222 Native Cavalry, 487 British Infantry, and 474\r\nGurkhas; in all, 1,381 men, besides 36 officers--not a very large\r\nforce, but composed of excellent material, and large enough, I\r\nconsidered, augmented, as it would be, by the Lataband detachment, to\r\nmove safely on Kabul. I had no hesitation, therefore, in sending Gough\r\nperemptory orders to advance without delay, thus relieving him of all\r\nresponsibility in the event of anything unexpected occurring.\r\n\r\nHudson, at Lataband, as has already been recorded, was only victualled\r\nuntil the 23rd, before which date I had calculated that Gough would\r\nsurely have relieved the garrison and brought the troops away. But now\r\nall was uncertain, and it was incumbent upon me to send them food. The\r\ndifficulty as to how to get supplies to Lataband was solved by\r\nsome Hazaras, who had been working in our camp for several weeks,\r\nvolunteering to convey what was necessary, and it was arranged that\r\nthe provisions should be sent with two parties, one on the 19th, the\r\nother on the 20th. The first got through safely, but the second almost\r\nentirely fell into the hands of the enemy.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st a heliogram from Hudson informed me that Gough's brigade\r\nwas expected the next day; but as it had been found necessary to drop\r\nhis Cavalry at the several posts he passed on the way for their better\r\nprotection, I deemed it expedient to send him the 12th Bengal Cavalry,\r\nfor he had to pass through some fairly open country near Butkhak,\r\nwhere they might possibly be of use to him. Accordingly, they started\r\nat 3 a.m. on the 22nd, with instructions to halt at Butkhak should\r\nthat post be unoccupied, otherwise to push on to Lataband.\r\n\r\nFinding the former place in possession of the Afghans, Major Green,\r\nwho was in command of the regiment, made for the further post, where\r\nhe arrived with the loss of only three men killed and three wounded.\r\n\r\nIt was not easy to get reliable information as to the movements or\r\nintentions of the enemy while we were surrounded in Sherpur; but from\r\nspies who managed to pass to and from the city under cover of night, I\r\ngathered that plans were being made to attack us.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, until the 21st that there were any very great\r\nsigns of activity. On that and the following day the several posts to\r\nthe east of the cantonment were occupied preparatory to an attack from\r\nthat quarter; and I was told that numbers of scaling-ladders were\r\nbeing constructed. This looked like business. Next, information was\r\nbrought in that, in all the mosques, mullas were making frantic\r\nappeals to the people to unite in one final effort to exterminate the\r\ninfidel; and that the aged Mushk-i-Alam was doing all in his power to\r\nfan the flame of fanaticism, promising to light with his own hand\r\nat dawn on the 23rd (the last day of the _Moharram_, when religious\r\nexaltation amongst Mahomedans is at its height) the beacon-fire which\r\nwas to be the signal for assault.\r\n\r\nThe night of the 22nd was undisturbed, save by the songs and cries of\r\nthe Afghans outside the walls, but just before day the flames of the\r\nsignal-fire, shooting upwards from the topmost crag of the Asmai\r\nrange, were plainly to be seen, followed on the instant by a burst of\r\nfiring.\r\n\r\nOur troops were already under arms and at their posts, waiting for the\r\nassault, which commenced with heavy firing against the eastern and\r\nsouthern faces. The most determined attack was directed against the\r\ntwo sections commanded by Brigadier-General Hugh Gough and Colonel\r\nJenkins, who by their able dispositions proved themselves worthy of\r\nthe confidence I had reposed in them.\r\n\r\nIt was too dark at first to see anything in front of the walls, and\r\norders were given to reserve fire until the advancing masses of the\r\nassailants could be clearly made out. Gough's Mountain guns, under\r\nLieutenant Sherries, then fired star-shells, which disclosed the\r\nattacking force up to a thousand yards off. The 28th Punjab Infantry\r\nwere the first to open fire; then the Guides, the 67th, and 92nd, each\r\nin their turn, greeted by their volleys the _ghazis_ who approached\r\nclose to the walls. Guns from every battery opened on the foe moving\r\nforward to the attack, and from 7 to 10 a.m. the fight was carried on.\r\nRepeated attempts were made to scale the south-eastern wall, and many\r\ntimes the enemy got up as far as the abattis, but were repulsed,\r\nheaps of dead marking the spots where these attempts had been most\r\npersistent.[3]\r\n\r\nSoon after 10 a.m. there was a slight lull in the fighting, leading us\r\nto believe that the Afghans were recoiling before the breechloaders.\r\nAn hour later, however, the assault grew hot as ever, and finding we\r\ncould not drive the enemy back by any fire which could be brought\r\nagainst them from the defences, I resolved to attack them in flank.\r\nAccordingly, I directed Major Craster, with four Field Artillery guns,\r\nand Lieutenant-Colonel Williams, with the 5th Punjab Cavalry, to move\r\nout over the hollow in the Bimaru range and open fire on a body of the\r\nenemy collected in and around the village of Kurja Kila. This fire had\r\nthe desired effect; the Afghans wavered and broke.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment the attacking force appeared to lose heart, the\r\nassault was no longer prosecuted with the same vigour, and by 1 p.m.\r\nit had ceased altogether, and the enemy were in full flight.\r\n\r\nThis was the Cavalry's opportunity. I ordered Massy to follow in\r\npursuit with every available man, and before nightfall all the open\r\nground in the neighbourhood of Sherpur was cleared of the enemy.\r\nSimultaneously with the movement of the Cavalry, a party was\r\ndespatched to destroy some villages near the southern wall which had\r\ncaused us much trouble, and whence it was necessary the enemy should\r\nbe driven, to facilitate the entrance of Brigadier-General Charles\r\nGough the next day, for that officer had arrived with his brigade\r\nwithin about six miles of Sherpur, where I could see his tents, and\r\ngathered from the fact of his pitching them that he meant to halt\r\nthere for the night. The villages were found to be occupied by\r\n_ghazis_, who refused to surrender, preferring to remain and perish in\r\nthe buildings, which were then blown up. Two gallant Engineer\r\nofficers (Captain Dundas, V.C., and Lieutenant C. Nugent) were most\r\nunfortunately killed in carrying out this duty.\r\n\r\nThe relief I felt when I had gathered my force inside the walls of\r\nSherpur on the evening of the 14th December was small compared to that\r\nwhich I experienced on the morning of the 24th, when I realized that\r\nnot only had the assault been abandoned, but that the great tribal\r\ncombination had dissolved, and that not a man of the many thousands\r\nwho had been opposed to us the previous day remained in any of the\r\nvillages, or on the surrounding hills. It was difficult to form an\r\naccurate estimate of the numbers opposed to us. As the Contingent from\r\nthe more distant districts advanced, they received accessions from\r\nevery place they passed, and as they neared Kabul they were joined by\r\nthe inhabitants of the numerous villages, and by the disaffected in\r\nthe city. It was calculated by those best able to judge that the\r\ncombined forces exceeded 100,000, and I myself do not think that an\r\nexcessive computation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN TO ILLUSTRATE THE DEFENCES OF SHERPUR AND\r\n    THE OPERATIONS ROUND KABUL IN DECEMBER, 1879]\r\n\r\nOur casualties between the 15th and the 23rd were remarkably few: 2\r\nofficers, 9 men, and 7 followers killed, and 5 officers, 41 men, and\r\n22 followers wounded; while the enemy lost not less than 3,000.\r\n\r\nI think I had great reason to be proud of my force. All night and\r\nevery night, the ground covered with snow and the thermometer marking\r\nsixteen degrees of frost, officers and men were at their posts, and\r\neach day every available man had to be hard at work strengthening the\r\ndefences. Native and European soldiers alike bore the hardships and\r\nexposure with the utmost cheerfulness, and in perfect confidence that,\r\nwhen the assault should take place, victory would be ours.\r\n\r\nEarly on the 24th the fort of Mahomed Sharif was occupied, and a force\r\nmoved out to escort Charles Gough's brigade into Sherpur, a precaution\r\nwhich, however, was hardly necessary, as there was no enemy to be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nI next set to work to re-open communication with India, Butkhak was\r\nre-occupied, and the relaying of the telegraph was taken in hand.\r\nGeneral Hills resumed his position as military Governor of Kabul; the\r\ndispensary and hospital were re-established in the city under the\r\nenergetic and intelligent guidance of Surgeon-Captain Owen;[4] and\r\nin the hope of reassuring the people, I issued the following\r\nProclamation:\r\n\r\n    'At the instigation of some seditious men, the ignorant people,\r\n    generally not considering the result, raised a rebellion. Now many\r\n    of the insurgents have received their reward, and as subjects\r\n    are a trust from God, the British Government, which is just and\r\n    merciful, as well as strong, has forgiven their guilt. It is now\r\n    proclaimed that all who come in without delay will be pardoned,\r\n    excepting only Mahomed Jan of Wardak, Mir Bacha of Kohistan,\r\n    Samandar Khan of Logar, Ghulam Hyder of Chardeh, and the murderers\r\n    of Sirdar Mahomed Hassan Khan. Come and make your submission\r\n    without fear, of whatsoever tribe you may be. You can then remain\r\n    in your houses in comfort and safety, and no harm will befall you.\r\n    The British Government has no enmity towards the people. Anyone\r\n    who rebels again will, of course, be punished. This condition is\r\n    necessary. But all who come in without delay need have no fear or\r\n    suspicion. The British Government speaks only that which is in its\r\n    heart.'\r\n\r\nThe effect of this Proclamation was most satisfactory: the city and\r\nthe surrounding country quieted rapidly, shops were re-opened, and\r\nbefore the close of the year the bazaars were as densely thronged as\r\never. Most of the principal men of Logar and Kohistan came to pay\r\ntheir respects to me; they were treated with due consideration, and\r\nthe political officers did all they could to find out what they\r\nreally wanted, so that some basis of an arrangement for the peaceful\r\nadministration of the country might be arrived at.\r\n\r\nWhile taking these measures, which I thought would create confidence\r\nin our clemency and justice, I endeavoured in other ways to prevent\r\na repetition of further serious troubles. Snow was still deep on the\r\nground, but I did not let it prevent my sending General Baker to\r\ndestroy a fort about twenty miles off, where dwelt an influential\r\n_malik_, who was one of the chief ringleaders in the revolt. All\r\nwalled enclosures within 1,000 yards of the cantonment were razed to\r\nthe ground, roads fit for guns were made all round the outside walls\r\nand towards the several gates of the city and Siah Sang, while two\r\nbridges, strong enough for Artillery to pass over, were thrown across\r\nthe Kabul River.\r\n\r\nThe increased numbers to be accommodated on the arrival of Gough's\r\nbrigade necessitated the re-occupation of the Bala Hissar, the\r\ndefences of which were reconstructed so as to give a continuous line\r\nof fire, and admit of free circulation round the walls; roads were\r\nmade through the lower Bala Hissar, and redoubts and towers were built\r\non the Shahr-i-Darwaza range.\r\n\r\nA strong fort--Fort Roberts--was constructed on the south-west point\r\nof Siah Sang, which commanded the Bala Hissar and the city; a smaller\r\none was built at the crossing of the river; and as these two forts\r\nwere not within sight of each other, a tower to connect them was\r\nconstructed at the north-west extremity of Siah Sang.\r\n\r\nSherpur was thus made safe; but for the absolute protection of the\r\ncity against an enemy operating from the Chardeh direction, a third\r\nfort was erected on the Asmai heights, which completed a formidable\r\nline of defences most skilfully carried out by Colonel Perkins and his\r\nstaff.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Four and a half miles.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The committee consisted of Brigadier-General T. D.\r\nBaker, Lieutenant Colonel Æ. Perkins, commanding Royal Engineers, and\r\nLieutenant-Colonel B. Gordon, commanding Royal Artillery.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: A curious exemplification of the passive courage and\r\nindifference to danger of some Natives was the behaviour of an old\r\nMahomedan servant of mine. At this juncture, just at the time when the\r\nfight was hottest, and I was receiving reports every few seconds from\r\nthe officers commanding the several posts, Eli Bux (a brother of the\r\nman who had been with me throughout the Mutiny) whispered in my ear\r\nthat my bath was ready. He was quite unmoved by the din and shots, and\r\nwas carrying on his ordinary duties as if nothing at all unusual was\r\noccurring.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: This hospital was admirably managed, and was attended by\r\na large number of patients, half of whom were women. The disease moat\r\nprevalent in Kabul was ophthalmia, caused by dust, dirt, and exposure,\r\nwhile cataract and other affections of the eye were very common. Dr.\r\nOwen, amongst his other many qualifications, excelled as an oculist,\r\nand his marvellous cures attracted sufferers from all parts of\r\nAfghanistan.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n1880\r\n\r\n  Two important questions--A Ruler required--News of Abdur Rahman Khan\r\n  --Abdur Rahman in Afghan-Turkestan--Overtures made to Abdur Rahman\r\n\r\n\r\nThe outlook in Afghanistan on the 1st January, 1880, was fairly\r\nsatisfactory; the tidings of the defeat and dispersion of the\r\ntribesmen had spread far and wide, and had apparently had the effect\r\nof tranquillizing the country even in remote Kandahar, where the\r\npeople had been greatly excited by the news of our retiring from\r\nSherpur, and by the exaggerated reports of their countrymen's success.\r\nNo complications now existed anywhere, and preparations were commenced\r\nfor Sir Donald Stewart's force in southern Afghanistan to move\r\ntowards Ghazni, in anticipation of the carrying out of a complete and\r\nconnected scheme[1] for the pacification of the country, and an early\r\nwithdrawal from northern Afghanistan. No withdrawal, however, would be\r\npossible until durable foundations had been laid for the future\r\nsafety of the Indian frontier, and reliable guarantees given for the\r\ncontinued good behaviour of India's Afghan neighbours.\r\n\r\nThe two questions, therefore, which chiefly exercised the minds of\r\npeople in authority, both in England and in India, with regard to\r\nAfghan affairs were, What was to be done with Afghanistan now we had\r\ngot it? and, Who could be set up as Ruler with any chance of being\r\nable to hold his own?\r\n\r\nThe second question depended a good deal on the decision which might\r\nbe arrived at with regard to the first, for the selection of a Ruler\r\ncould hardly be considered until it had been determined whether the\r\nseveral provinces of Afghanistan were to be again formed into one\r\nkingdom, or whether the political scheme for the future government of\r\nthe country should be based on the separation of the several States.\r\n\r\nI myself had come to the conclusion, after much deliberation and\r\nanxious thought, that the latter course was the least dangerous for us\r\nto adopt. Disintegration had been the normal condition of Afghanistan,\r\nexcept for a short period which ended as far back as 1818. Dost\r\nMahomed was the first since that time to attempt its unification, and\r\nit took him (the strongest Amir of the century) eight years after his\r\nrestoration to establish his supremacy over Afghan-Turkestan, fourteen\r\nyears before Kandahar acknowledged his authority, and twenty-one years\r\nere he got possession of Herat, a consummation which was achieved only\r\njust before his death. His successor, Sher Ali, was five years making\r\nhimself master of Afghanistan, and he could never have attained that\r\nposition but for the material assistance he received from us. I felt\r\nit would be in the future as it had been in the past, and that there\r\nwould always be the danger of a Ruler, made supreme by the aid of our\r\nmoney and our arms, turning against us for some supposed grievance, or\r\nat the instigation of a foreign Power, as had happened with Sher Ali.\r\nA strong, united Afghanistan was very desirable, no doubt, could we\r\nbe certain that its interests and ours would always remain identical;\r\nbut, in addition to the chance of its strength and unity being used\r\nagainst us, there was the certainty that, even if the man we might\r\nchoose as Amir were to remain perfectly loyal, at his death Afghan\r\nhistory would repeat itself; the succession to the throne would be\r\ndisputed, and the unification would have to begin all over again. For\r\nthese reasons I had no hesitation in giving it as my opinion that\r\nAfghanistan should be disintegrated, and that we should not again\r\nattempt to place the whole country under any one Sovereign.\r\n\r\nMy views must have commended themselves to the Government of India,\r\nfor in their despatch to the Secretary of State, dated 7th January,\r\n1880, they indicated them as the line of policy they proposed to adopt\r\nin pursuance of the object they had at heart, viz., the safety of the\r\nIndian Empire and the tranquillity of its northern frontier; and in\r\nthe communication to myself, conveying their idea of the general\r\nprinciples upon which the permanent settlement of Afghanistan should\r\nbe based, the Foreign Secretary wrote that all arrangements for\r\nthe establishment of a durable Government at Kabul depended on the\r\nselection of a suitable Ruler for that province; and that, as it was\r\nessential to clear away any apprehension that the British Government\r\ncontemplated territorial annexation, which might be caused by a\r\nprolonged interregnum, it would be very advantageous if one of the\r\nprincipal Sirdars, qualified by his family connexions, his local\r\ninfluence, and his personal following, could be selected as the Ruler\r\nof the Kabul State.\r\n\r\nThere was another very strong reason why the Government of India\r\nshould wish to find some one to whom the administration of the country\r\ncould safely be made over. The first warning notes of a General\r\nElection were heard in India early in January. Afghan affairs were\r\nbeing made a party question, and the policy of the Beaconsfield\r\nGovernment with regard to them was being severely and adversely\r\ncriticized. Lord Lytton was, therefore, most anxious that a definite\r\nconclusion should be arrived at as to the administration of\r\nAfghanistan, and a period put to our occupation of the northern\r\nprovince before the meeting of Parliament should take place.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty was to find the right man. Abdur Rahman, who I had\r\nreason to believe would be acceptable to the army, was far away, I\r\ncould not find out where, and I could think of no one else at all\r\nsuitable. Under the circumstances, I deemed it advisable to open\r\nnegotiations with the several leaders of the late combination against\r\nus, who were congregated at Ghazni, and had with them the young\r\nHeir-apparent, Musa Khan. In the middle of January I had received two\r\ncommunications from these people, one ostensibly written by Musa Khan\r\nhimself, the other signed by seventy of the most influential\r\nchiefs; the tenor of both was the same; they demanded Yakub Khan's\r\nrestoration, and asserted his innocence as to the massacre of the\r\nEmbassy. I replied that Yakub Khan's return was impossible, and that\r\nthey must consider his abdication final, as he himself had declared\r\nthat he wished it to be,[2] and a few days later I deputed the\r\nMustaufi[3] to visit Ghazni, in the hope that he might be able to\r\ninduce the leaders to make some more feasible suggestion for the\r\ngovernment of the country.\r\n\r\nThe Mustaufi had scarcely started, before what seemed to be a reliable\r\nreport reached me that Abdur Rahman was at Kanduz, on his way to\r\nBadakhshan, and I immediately communicated this news to Lord Lytton.\r\n\r\nA fortnight later Abdur Rahman's mother, who resided at Kandahar,\r\ninformed Sir Donald Stewart that Ayub Khan had received a letter from\r\nher son, in answer to an offer from Ayub to join him at Balkh and\r\nmarch with him against the British. In this letter Abdur Rahman had\r\nreplied that he would have nothing to do with any of Sher Ali's\r\nfamily, who had deceived him and dealt with him in the same\r\ntreacherous manner that characterized Sher Ali's dealings with the\r\nBritish; further, that he had no intention of opposing the British,\r\nknowing full well he was not strong enough to do so; that he could not\r\nleave Russian territory without the permission of the Russians, whose\r\npensioner he was; and that, even if he got that permission, he could\r\nnot come either into Turkestan or Kabul without an invitation from us,\r\nbut that, if he received such an invitation, he would obey it as an\r\norder. He concluded by advising Ayub Khan to make his submission to\r\nthe British, as opposition was useless. Sir Donald Stewart telegraphed\r\nthe substance of this communication to the Foreign Secretary, adding\r\nthat Abdur Rahman's family were well disposed towards us, and that\r\nthere would be no difficulty in communicating with the Sirdar through\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I had been careful to acquaint the Government of\r\nIndia with my failure to come to any conclusion with the Ghazni\r\nfaction as to the future government of the country, and the\r\nhopelessness of finding anyone of sufficient strength of character to\r\nset up as Ruler of Kabul; and I had suggested, failing a really strong\r\nman, the alternative of letting the Afghans choose for themselves some\r\nRuler, other than Yakub Khan, and thus leave us free to evacuate the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Mr. Lyall, the Foreign Secretary, came to Kabul on\r\na visit to me, and Captain West Ridgeway[4] took the place of my\r\nPolitical Secretary, Mr. Durand, who left me to join the Foreign\r\nOffice at Simla, Mr. (now Sir) Lepel Griffin, Secretary to the Punjab\r\nGovernment, being appointed Chief of the political staff at Kabul.\r\n\r\nLyall told me that the Indian Government fully appreciated the\r\ndifficulty I was in about finding a Ruler for the province, and that,\r\nunless Abdur Rahman could be brought within negotiable distance, the\r\nalternative I had suggested would have to be acted upon.\r\n\r\nLord Lytton, however, was very sanguine about Abdur Rahman, and he\r\nwarned Mr. Griffin, before he started for Kabul, that the Sirdar's\r\nletter to Ayub Khan indicated possibilities that might have the most\r\nimportant bearing on the solution of the difficult problem to be dealt\r\nwith in northern Afghanistan. It was Lord Lytton's wish to place Abdur\r\nRahman on the throne of Kabul, or, at least, to afford him the best\r\nopportunity of winning his own way to that position. The difficulty\r\nwas to get at him, in the first instance, and, in the second, to\r\nconvince him of our wish and power to help him; while a not unnatural\r\nhesitation on the Sirdar's part to enter Afghanistan without Russia's\r\npermission had to be considered.\r\n\r\nLord Lytton impressed upon Mr. Griffin the necessity for overcoming\r\nthese difficulties in time to enable us to withdraw from northern\r\nAfghanistan in the early autumn at latest; and he desired Sir Oliver\r\nSt. John (Sir Donald Stewart's political officer, who was at that time\r\nin Calcutta), immediately on his return to Kandahar, to communicate\r\nwith Abdur Rahman, through his mother, the Viceroy's willingness to\r\nmake him Ruler of Kabul and Turkestan, if he would accept the terms\r\noffered to him without delay.\r\n\r\nThe Viceroy communicated his views to the Secretary of State in the\r\nfollowing telegram:\r\n\r\n    'Necessary to find without delay some Native authority to which we\r\n    can restore northern Afghanistan without risk of immediate anarchy\r\n    on our evacuation of Kabul not later than next autumn, and if\r\n    possible earlier. No prospect of finding in the country any man\r\n    strong enough for this purpose. I therefore advocate early public\r\n    recognition of Abdur Rahman as legitimate heir of Dost Mahomed,\r\n    and open deputation of Sirdars with British concurrence to offer\r\n    him throne of Afghanistan as sole means of saving the country from\r\n    anarchy. Do you approve?'\r\n\r\nLord Cranbrook's reply was as follows:\r\n\r\n    'Assuming that Abdur Rahman is acceptable to the country, and that\r\n    he would be content with northern Afghanistan, it is desirable to\r\n    support him at Kabul; the more spontaneous any advances to him\r\n    on the part of the Sirdars, and the less appearance of British\r\n    influence, the better. But where is he? And how do you propose\r\n    to learn his wishes and intentions? If invited by Chiefs, every\r\n    inducement to bring him to Kabul should be then held out. Public\r\n    recognition should not precede, but follow, his adoption by\r\n    Sirdars, and his acceptance of the position.'\r\n\r\nBy the end of March authentic intelligence was received that\r\nAbdur Rahman had made himself master of Afghan-Turkestan, and was\r\ncorresponding with the representative Sirdars at Kabul. It seemed,\r\ntherefore, that the time had arrived when distinct overtures might\r\nbe made to Abdur Rahman; accordingly, on the 1st April Mr. Griffin\r\naddressed to him the following letter:\r\n\r\n    'It has become known that you have entered Afghanistan, and\r\n    consequently this letter is sent you by a confidential messenger,\r\n    in order that you may submit to the British officers at Kabul\r\n    any representations that you may desire to make to the British\r\n    Government with regard to your object in entering Afghanistan.'\r\n\r\nAbdur Rahman, in his friendly but guarded reply,[5] expressed in\r\ngeneral terms his hope of being recognized as Amir. He greatly\r\ndesired, he wrote, the friendship of the British, and their assistance\r\nin restoring peace and order to Afghanistan; but at the same time,\r\nhe hinted that his obligations to the Russian Government for the\r\nhospitality they had extended to him placed him in some doubt as to\r\nthe terms upon which our friendship might be accorded to him, and\r\nwhile he expressed a desire for the permanent establishment of\r\nAfghanistan, with our assistance and sympathy, he let it be understood\r\nthat he wished to consider himself under the protection of Russia as\r\nwell as of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIn a verbal message, however, he added that he was ready to cross the\r\nHindu Kush to discuss matters with our officers, and he begged that\r\nhe might be furnished with information as to the 'nature of our\r\nfriendship' and 'its conditions.'\r\n\r\nIn answer, Mr. Griffin was directed to inform Abdur Rahman that the\r\nrelations of Afghanistan to the British and Russian Empires was a\r\nsubject the Government of India must decline to discuss with him, and\r\nto explain that their declared determination had been the exclusion\r\nof foreign influence and interference from Afghanistan, a cardinal\r\ncondition 'which had at all times and under all circumstances been\r\ndeemed essential for the permanent security of Her Majesty's Indian\r\nEmpire,' a condition, moreover, which had always been accepted by the\r\nGovernment of the Czar, which had repeatedly renewed those assurances,\r\nsolemnly given to Her Majesty's Ministers, that 'Russia considered\r\nAfghanistan as entirely beyond the sphere of her influence.'[6]\r\n\r\nEarly in April the Mustaufi (whom, it will be remembered, I had sent\r\nto Ghazni to communicate with the Chiefs, and ascertain their ideas\r\nand desires as to the future government of Kabul) returned without\r\nhaving achieved much success. He had persuaded some of the leading men\r\nto accompany him as far as Maidan, whence a few representatives came\r\non to Kabul as bearers of a document signed by Mahomed Jan, twelve\r\nother Sirdars, and 189 influential tribesmen, setting forth their\r\nviews and wishes; but as these were all based upon the restoration of\r\nYakub Khan, their proposals could not be entertained.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th April I held a durbar, at which I received this\r\ndeputation; all the Sirdars, Chiefs, and _maliks_ of Kabul and many\r\nHazaras being present. Mr. Griffin, on the part of the Government,\r\ntold them that Yakub Khan could not be allowed to return to\r\nAfghanistan, but that the names of any Sirdars, approved of by a large\r\nproportion of the people for the Amirship, would be laid before the\r\nViceroy; that there was no intention of annexing Afghanistan, and\r\nthat there would be no occupation of any places except such as were\r\nnecessary for the safety of our Indian frontier. They were further\r\ninformed that the British army would be withdrawn as soon as the\r\ncountry had settled down peacefully and an Amir, amicably disposed\r\ntowards us, had been selected; but that Kandahar would not again be\r\nunited to Kabul.\r\n\r\nThe effect produced was good. The deputation was greatly disappointed\r\nthat Yakub Khan was not to be permitted to return, but all present\r\nfelt that they had received a definite reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In reply to a reference made to me on the subject,\r\nI represented that, before operations could be undertaken on so\r\nextensive a scale as was proposed, it would be necessary to reinforce\r\nthe Kabul garrison and the several posts on the Kyber line by:\r\n\r\n  One battery of Horse or Field Artillery.\r\n  One Heavy battery.\r\n  One Mountain battery.\r\n  A detachment of Garrison Artillery.\r\n  A brigade of Cavalry.\r\n  Three companies of Sappers and Miners.\r\n  Two regiments of British Infantry.\r\n  Six regiments of Native Infantry.\r\n  Drafts sufficient to raise each Infantry regiment at\r\n  Kabul to 800 men.\r\n\r\nThis was agreed to; the reinforcements were sent up by degrees, and\r\na second division was formed at Kabul, to the command of which\r\nMajor-General J. Ross,[*] C.B., was appointed.]\r\n\r\n  [Note *: Now General Sir John Ross, G.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: As the deportation of Yakub Khan was believed to be one\r\nof the chief causes of recent disturbances, and as a powerful party in\r\nthe country still looked forward to having him back as their Ruler, I\r\nwas directed to make it clear to his adherents that the ex-Amir would\r\nnever be allowed to return to Afghanistan, and that his abdication\r\nmust be, as he himself at the time wished it to be, considered\r\nirrevocable. In support of this decision, I was informed that the\r\nunanimous verdict of guilty of murder, recorded against Yakub Khan\r\nby Colonel Macgregor's Commission, was substantially endorsed by the\r\nChief Justice of Calcutta and the Advocate-General; and that, although\r\nother authorities who had considered the evidence did not quite go so\r\nfar as these two high legal functionaries, the general conclusion\r\ncome to was that, if the Amir did not connive at the massacre of the\r\nMission, he made no attempt whatever to interpose on its behalf,\r\nand that his whole conduct on that occasion betrayed a culpable\r\nindifference to the fate of Sir Louis Cavagnari and his companions,\r\nand a total disregard of the solemn obligation which he had contracted\r\nwith the British Government.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: I had released the Mustaufi from confinement when the\r\ngeneral amnesty was published on the 26th December, and he had\r\nsubsequently been usefully employed assisting the political officers\r\nin revenue matters.

On the 16th I\r\nreceived a letter from Sir Donald, dated six days before, asking me to\r\nsend supplies to meet him. I, therefore, that same day despatched a\r\nsmall column, under the command of Major General Ross, C.B., with the\r\narticles of food required; and as I thought it likely that my object\r\nin sending this force might be misunderstood, the deputation which\r\nattended the durbar was told to explain matters to the Chiefs at\r\nMaidan, and assure them that the advance would be peaceful unless\r\nhostilities should be provoked by their own action. Notwithstanding\r\nthis precaution, I thought it quite possible the column would be\r\nopposed, for the news concerning Abdur Rahman's advent was causing\r\nconsiderable excitement; and whilst the soldiers and a proportion of\r\nthe tribesmen were disposed to welcome him as a deliverer, those from\r\nWardak and Logar resented his appearance on the scene as putting an\r\nend to their hopes of having Yakub Khan reinstated.\r\n\r\nWith a view, therefore, to prevent the Logaris from joining any attack\r\nwhich might be made on General Ross, I sent a party, 1,200 strong,\r\nunder Colonel Jenkins, in the direction of Charasia.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd April Ross reached Sar-i-top, forty-one miles from Ghazni;\r\nSir Donald Stewart having arrived that same day at the latter place,\r\nheliographic communication was at once opened with him, and the\r\nwelcome news was signalled that Sir Donald had fought an engagement at\r\nAhmedkhel on the 19th, and had been entirely successful. On receipt of\r\nthis intelligence I ordered a Royal salute to be fired in honour of\r\nthe victory, the announcement of which I hoped might have a quieting\r\neffect on the excitement which prevailed around Kabul.\r\n\r\nIn this I was disappointed. On the evening of the 24th, Jenkins, who\r\nwas encamped at Charasia, heard that he was about to be attacked by\r\nthe Logaris, under Mahomed Hasan Khan. At once striking his tents,\r\nand collecting his baggage in a sheltered spot, he ordered a party of\r\nCavalry to reconnoitre up the Logar valley, strengthened his piquets,\r\nand sent off an express messenger to inform me of the situation.\r\n\r\nI immediately despatched Brigadier-General Macpherson to Jenkins's\r\nassistance. By 9 a.m. he had started, with four Mountain guns and\r\n962 Infantry, followed later by two more guns and a troop of the 3rd\r\nPunjab Cavalry; and as a support to Macpherson, Brigadier-General Hugh\r\nGough, with the Cavalry brigade and four Horse Artillery guns, was\r\nordered to take up a position half-way between Kabul and Charasia.\r\n\r\nAt 1 p.m. on the 25th Macpherson arrived on the high ground beyond the\r\n_sang-i-nawishta_ gorge, whence he obtained a good view of Jenkins's\r\nposition; and seeing that the enemy formed a complete semicircle round\r\nit, he pushed on. Jenkins had stood on the defensive from the early\r\nmorning, and the Afghans, who had advanced to within a couple of\r\nhundred yards, were only kept at bay by the steadiness of his fire.\r\n\r\nMacpherson first sent back the baggage to Sherpur, so as to free all\r\nhands for action, and then proceeded to attack the left horn of the\r\nsemicircle. The enemy broke, fell back, and were completely scattered\r\nby a well-directed Artillery fire; the surrounding hills were speedily\r\ncleared, and the Cavalry and Horse Artillery pursued for four miles.\r\nBy four o'clock not a single living Afghan was to be seen; more than\r\n200 had been killed, while our casualties were only four killed and\r\nthirty-four wounded.\r\n\r\nI came up just as the fight was over; and being sure from the decisive\r\ncharacter of the defeat that a retirement could not be misunderstood,\r\nI ordered the troops to return to Kabul.\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of Sir Donald Stewart's arrival, and the consequent\r\nnecessity for my making over to him, as my senior, the supreme command\r\nof the Kabul Field Force, I prepared a report[2] for his information,\r\nwhich explained the general military situation in northern\r\nAfghanistan, and contained a statement of economic details which I\r\nthought would be of use to the Government, and concerning which an\r\nexperience of eighteen months in the field enabled me to give an\r\nopinion with some confidence.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the Kabul Field Force at the end of April amounted to\r\nnearly 14,000 men and thirty-eight guns, with 12,500 followers;[3]\r\nbesides 15,000 men and thirty guns on the Khyber line, under the\r\nimmediate command of Major-General Bright.\r\n\r\nSir Donald reached Kabul on the 5th May. On the same day we heard\r\nthat the Beaconsfield Administration had come to an end; that a new\r\nMinistry had been formed under Mr. Gladstone; that Lord Lytton had\r\nresigned, and was to be succeeded by the Marquis of Ripon; and that\r\nthe Marquis of Hartington had become Secretary of State for India.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the pleasure of meeting an old friend in my new\r\nCommander, that 5th of May was altogether not a happy day for me.\r\nLord Lytton's approaching departure was a source of real sorrow.\r\nPersonally, I felt that I was deeply indebted to him for the\r\nconfidence he had reposed in me, and for the warm support he had\r\ninvariably accorded me. I had hoped that he would have had the\r\ngratification of seeing, while in office, the campaign in which he was\r\nso much interested satisfactorily concluded, and with the prospect of\r\npermanent results; and I dreaded that a change of Government might\r\nmean a reversal of the policy which I believed to be the best for\r\nthe security of our position in India. Moreover, it was not in human\r\nnature to feel absolute satisfaction in yielding up the supreme\r\ncommand I had so greatly delighted in, into the hands of another, even\r\nthough that other was one for whom I had so great a personal regard,\r\nand under whom I had already served in the field.\r\n\r\nThe amalgamated troops were now styled the Northern Afghanistan Field\r\nForce, and I retained the command of the two divisions at Kabul, with\r\nMajor-General John Ross as second in command; while Major-General\r\nHills was given the brigades from Kandahar, which now became the third\r\ndivision of the Force.\r\n\r\nThe idea in bringing Stewart away from Kandahar was that he should\r\noccupy Ghazni and Kabul; that my divisions should operate in Kohistan\r\nand in the direction of Bamian; that General Bright should move\r\nagainst the Ghilzais; and that a column from Kuram should march over\r\nthe Shutargardan to Kabul. It was hoped that these operations would\r\nhave the effect of quieting the country, and, by the time they\r\nhad been carried out, it would be possible to evacuate northern\r\nAfghanistan.\r\n\r\nWith a view to having my divisions thoroughly efficient and mobile for\r\nthe service they were expected to perform, I had largely replenished\r\nthe numbers of my transport animals, which had suffered greatly from\r\nthe strain put upon them in supplying the troops with food and other\r\nnecessaries during the winter months; they had been continuously at\r\nwork in the most inclement weather, numbers had died, and those that\r\nremained required to be carefully looked after and given complete\r\nrest to render them fit for the contemplated operations. Major Mark\r\nHeathcote, who had taken, at my particular request, the arduous charge\r\nof this department, wished to revert to regimental duty, so I applied\r\nfor, and obtained, the services of Lieutenant Colonel B. Low[4]\r\nas Director of Transport, under whose energetic and intelligent\r\nmanagement the transport service was rendered as perfect as it was\r\npossible to make it. In the end, circumstances prevented the concerted\r\nmovements for which these preparations were made being carried out,\r\nbut I reaped the benefit of them when later in the year I was required\r\nto undertake a rapid march to Kandahar, which could not possibly have\r\nbeen successfully accomplished had my transport not been in such\r\nadmirable condition.\r\n\r\nIn order to relieve the great pressure put upon the Commissariat\r\nDepartment by having to provide for the increased number of troops at\r\nKabul, and with a view to opening up the roads upon which traffic had\r\nbeen more or less impeded for some months, it was considered desirable\r\nto send a strong brigade towards Maidan, which I accompanied, and\r\nremained away from Kabul for some weeks. On my return, I found a\r\nconsiderable change had taken place in the political situation. The\r\nMustaufi had been deported to India; the correspondence between Abdur\r\nRahman and Mr. Griffin had taken rather an unsatisfactory turn, and\r\nthe Sirdar's dealings with the leading Chiefs and tribesmen had given\r\ncause to fear that, if he came to Kabul during our occupation, it\r\nmight be as an enemy rather than a friend.\r\n\r\nThe Mustaufi was a firm adherent of the Sher Ali faction, and, finding\r\nthere was no hope of Yakub Khan being reinstated, and that we were\r\nnegotiating with Abdur Rahman, he had espoused the cause of Yakub's\r\nyounger brother, Ayub Khan, and had been proved guilty of inciting the\r\nSirdars and Chiefs to oppose us. For this he was very properly sent\r\nout of Afghanistan; nevertheless, I looked upon his removal as a\r\nmisfortune, for it broke up the only party that could possibly be\r\nformed to counterbalance Abdur Rahman, who was astute enough to see\r\nthat the weaker our position became, the more chance there was of his\r\nbeing able to get his own terms from us.\r\n\r\nFrom the letters he had written to his friends and relations in\r\nnorthern Afghanistan (the majority of which had fallen into our\r\nhands), it was evident that he was doing all he could to strengthen\r\nhimself, even at our expense, and that he greatly disliked the idea of\r\nKandahar being separated from the kingdom of Kabul. Indeed, in one\r\nof his communications to Mr. Griffin he had made it clear that he\r\nexpected the whole inheritance of his grandfather, Dost Mahomed Khan,\r\nto be made over to him.\r\n\r\nThe uncertainty as to the result of the correspondence with Abdur\r\nRahman, the rumours in circulation regarding his real disposition and\r\nplans, and the general excitement throughout the country, suggested\r\nsuch grave doubts of the Sirdar's good faith that, in some quarters,\r\nthe question was seriously discussed whether it might not be necessary\r\nto break off negotiations with him, and reinstate Yakub Khan, or else\r\nset up his brother, Ayub Khan, as Amir.\r\n\r\nI myself was altogether opposed to Yakub Khan's restoration, and as\r\nto Ayub Khan, we were in total ignorance of his character and\r\nproclivities, even if he had been near enough to treat with. It\r\nappeared to me, moreover, that we had gone too far with Abdur Rahman\r\nto throw him over because, in conformity with Afghan character and\r\ntradition, he was not running quite straight. I, therefore, gave it as\r\nmy opinion that we should not change our tactics unless it was found\r\nimpossible to come to terms with him, or unless it was made evident on\r\nhis nearer approach to Kabul that the majority of his countrymen were\r\naverse to have him as their Ruler.\r\n\r\nSoon after this the situation began to improve, and early in July\r\nMr. Griffin was able to inform the Government of India that 'the\r\nprobabilities of a settlement with Abdur Rahman appear far more\r\nfavourable than they did last week....' 'Abdur Rahman has seen that\r\nwe have been fully informed of the game he has been playing, that\r\ntrickery and treachery would not be tolerated, and that, if he intends\r\ncoming to a settlement with us at all, he must be prepared to accept\r\nour terms rather than dictate his own.'\r\n\r\nA few days later a letter was received from Abdur Rahman, announcing\r\nhis arrival in Kohistan. His near approach, and the report that he\r\nwas willing to accept our terms, excited a keen and hopeful interest\r\nthroughout the country, for the Afghans had at length become convinced\r\nthat the only chance of getting rid of us was by agreeing to any form\r\nof settled government we might establish, and they had grown heartily\r\ntired of perpetual fighting and of having to maintain bands of\r\n_ghazis_ to oppose us, who were eating them out of house and home.\r\nWith the exception of the Sher Ali faction, therefore, whose interests\r\nwere directly opposed to his, Abdur Rahman's advent was welcomed by\r\nthe people, and several of the most influential amongst them went to\r\nmeet him.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of July Sir Donald Stewart was empowered to conclude\r\nall political and military arrangements preparatory to withdrawing\r\nfrom northern Afghanistan. Abdur Rahman was to be recognized as 'Amir\r\nof Kabul'; he was to be provided with a sufficient number of guns to\r\nstrengthen effectively his occupation of the city, and he was to be\r\ngiven as much money (within a maximum of ten lakhs) as was thought\r\nnecessary to meet his present wants. It was to be clearly explained to\r\nAbdur Rahman that the Government of India would not engage to give him\r\na regular subsidy, or a continuous supply of arms or money, and that\r\nafter he had taken possession of his capital he would have to rely\r\nupon his own resources for holding it. There was to be no treaty, and\r\nall questions of reciprocal engagements between the two Governments\r\nwere to be postponed until some settled and responsible administration\r\nhad been consolidated.\r\n\r\nGeneral Stewart was directed to make the best arrangements he could\r\nwith Abdur Rahman for the protection of the tribes and individuals who\r\nhad assisted us, and the Sirdar was to be informed that, if he\r\ndesired our goodwill, he could give no better proof of his friendly\r\ndisposition than by his behaviour towards those of his own nation in\r\nwhom the British Government were interested.\r\n\r\nSir Donald Stewart considered that the best way of giving effect to\r\nthese instructions was to publicly proclaim Abdur Rahman as Amir of\r\nKabul; for this purpose he held a durbar on the 22nd July, at which\r\nthe Sirdar's representatives were received. Sir Donald, in a few\r\nwords, gave his reasons for summoning them to meet him, and Mr.\r\nGriffin then explained more fully the motives by which the Government\r\nof India were actuated in acknowledging the claims of Abdur Rahman.\r\nImmediately after the durbar orders were issued for an early\r\nretirement.\r\n\r\nI was to withdraw my column by the Kuram route; but being anxious\r\nto see something of the Khyber line while I had the opportunity, I\r\nstarted off the following day to ride through the Jagdalak Pass to\r\nGandamak, where I was entertained by General Bright and his staff.\r\nThe next day I went on to Jalalabad, and was greatly interested\r\nin wandering over the place where Sir Robert Sale in some measure\r\nredeemed the lamentable failures of the first Afghan war.\r\n\r\nMy intention, when I left Kabul, was to ride as far as the Khyber\r\nPass, but suddenly a presentiment, which I have never been able to\r\nexplain to myself, made me retrace my steps and hurry back towards\r\nKabul--a presentiment of coming trouble which I can only characterize\r\nas instinctive.\r\n\r\nThe feeling was justified when, about half-way between Butkhak and\r\nKabul, I was met by Sir Donald Stewart and my Chief of the Staff,[5]\r\nwho brought me the astounding news of the total defeat by Ayub Khan\r\nof Brigadier-General Burrows's brigade at Maiwand, and of\r\nLieutenant-General Primrose,[6] with the remainder of his force, being\r\nbesieged at Kandahar.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Sir Donald Stewart's division was replaced at Kandahar by\r\ntroops from Bombay.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The part of the report which deals with economic details\r\nis given in the Appendix (see Appendix X.); the military portion is\r\nomitted, as it was only intended for Sir Donald Stewart's information\r\nat the time.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Of these, more than 3,000 were doolie-bearers, and nearly\r\n8,000 were _saices_ of Native Cavalry regiments, and men belonging to\r\nthe Transport and other Departments.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Now Major-General Sir Robert Low, G.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Colonel Macgregor and Lieutenant-Colonel Chapman had\r\nchanged places, the former joining Sir Donald Stewart as Chief of the\r\nStaff, and the latter taking up the same position with me.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Lieutenant-General Primrose succeeded Sir Donald Stewart\r\nin command of the troops at Kandahar.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\n1880\r\n\r\n  Affairs at Kandahar--The Maiwand disaster\r\n  --Relief from Kabul suggested--A force ordered from Kabul\r\n  --Preparations for the march--The Kabul-Kandahar Field Force\r\n  --Commissariat and Transport\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more than six months rumours had been afloat of Ayub Khan's\r\ndetermination to advance on Kandahar; but little attention was paid to\r\nthem by the authorities at that place until towards the end of May,\r\nwhen a Sirdar, named Sher Ali,[1] who had been a few days before\r\nformally installed as Wali, or Ruler, of Kandahar, informed the\r\npolitical officer, Lieutenant-Colonel St. John, that the British\r\noccupation of Kabul had had the effect of bringing about a\r\nreconciliation between the various chiefs at Herat, who had placed\r\nthemselves under the leadership of Ayub Khan and induced him to\r\nproclaim a _jahad_. Sher Ali, who evidently considered this news\r\nauthentic, declared his belief that his own troops,[2] who were then\r\nengaged in collecting revenue in Zamindawar, would desert to Ayub Khan\r\nas he approached Kandahar, and he begged that a brigade of British\r\nsoldiers might be sent to Girishk to support him.\r\n\r\nOn General Primrose communicating this information to the\r\nCommander-in-Chief in India, he recommended to the Government that the\r\nBombay reserve division, located at Jacobabad, Hyderabad, and Karachi,\r\nshould be mobilized so soon as it became certain that Ayub Khan really\r\ncontemplated this move, as in his opinion the garrison at Kandahar\r\nwould be left dangerously weak after a brigade had been detached for\r\nGirishk.\r\n\r\nAyub Khan's movements, however, were not ascertained until the 27th\r\nJune, when he had advanced halfway to the Helmand; it was too late\r\nthen to mobilize troops so far off as Jacobabad, Hyderabad, and\r\nKarachi with any chance of their being in time to check his onward\r\nmarch. The news of his approach spread rapidly, and had the most\r\ndisturbing effect in Kandahar and its neighbourhood. The Governor's\r\nauthority daily diminished, and many of the inhabitants left the city.\r\n\r\nAyub Khan had with him, when he started from Herat on the 15th June,\r\n7,500 men and ten guns as the nucleus of an army, which he calculated,\r\nas he moved forward, would be strongly reinforced by tribesmen,\r\nlevies, and _ghazis_.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th July a brigade, under the command of Brigadier-General\r\nBurrows, started from Kandahar, and reached the Helmand on the 11th,\r\nencamping on the near bank of the river opposite Girishk. On the\r\nfurther bank Sirdar Sher Ali's troops were located, having with them\r\nsix guns. Two days afterwards these troops deserted in a body to the\r\nenemy, but did not succeed in taking their Artillery with them, as\r\nBurrows, on perceiving their intention, crossed the river and captured\r\nthe guns.\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General Burrows's position had now entirely changed; instead\r\nof there being a loyal force under the Wali, with which to co-operate\r\nand prevent Ayub Khan crossing the Helmand, he found himself with an\r\ninadequate number of troops, the Wali's men gone over to the enemy,\r\nand the Wali himself a fugitive in the British camp. The Helmand was\r\nfordable everywhere at that season, making it easy for Ayub to cut off\r\nBurrows's retreat; the first twenty-five of the eighty miles by which\r\nhe was separated from Kandahar was a desert, and no supplies were\r\nforthcoming owing to the hostile attitude of the people. Burrows\r\ntherefore determined to retire to Khushk-i-Nakhud, an important\r\nposition half-way to Kandahar, covering the road from Girishk, and\r\nwhere supplies and water were plentiful.\r\n\r\nBurrows reached Khushk-i-Nakhud on the 16th July. On the 22nd the\r\nCommander-in-Chief in India, who had been inquiring from General\r\nPrimrose whether there were 'any routes from the Helmand passing by\r\nthe north to Ghazni, by which Ayub Khan might move with his guns,'\r\ntelegraphed to Primrose: 'You will understand that you have full\r\nliberty to attack Ayub, if you consider you are strong enough to do\r\nso. Government consider it of the highest political importance that\r\nhis force should be dispersed, and prevented by all possible means\r\nfrom passing on to Ghazni.'\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 26th information was received by\r\nBrigadier-General Burrows that 2,000 of the enemy's Cavalry and a\r\nlarge body of _ghazis_ had arrived at Maiwand, eleven miles off, and\r\nthat Ayub Khan was about to follow with the main body of his army.\r\n\r\nTo prevent Ayub Khan getting to Ghazni, General Burrows had to do one\r\nof two things, either await him at Khushk-i-Nakhud, or intercept him\r\nat Maiwand. After consulting with Colonel St. John, he determined to\r\nadopt the latter course, as he hoped thus to be able to deal with the\r\n_ghazis_ before they were joined by Ayub Khan.\r\n\r\nThe brigade started soon after 6 a.m. on the 27th. It was encumbered\r\nby a large number of baggage animals, which Burrows considered could\r\nnot be left behind because of the hostile state of the country, and\r\nthe impossibility of detaching any part of his already too small force\r\nfor their protection.\r\n\r\nAt 10 a.m., when about half-way to Maiwand, a spy brought in\r\ninformation that Ayub Khan had arrived at that place, and was\r\noccupying it in force; General Burrows, however, considered it then\r\ntoo late to turn back, and decided to advance. At a quarter to twelve\r\nthe forces came into collision, and the fight lasted until past three\r\no'clock. The Afghans, who, Burrows reported, numbered 25,000, soon\r\noutflanked the British. Our Artillery expended their ammunition, and\r\nthe Native portion of the brigade got out of hand, and pressed back on\r\nthe few British Infantry, who were unable to hold their own against\r\nthe overwhelming numbers of the enemy. Our troops were completely\r\nrouted, and had to thank the apathy of the Afghans in not following\r\nthem up for escaping total annihilation.\r\n\r\nOf the 2,476 men engaged at Maiwand, 934 were killed and 175 were\r\nwounded and missing;[3] the remnant struggled on throughout the night\r\nto Kandahar, where the first of the fugitives arrived early on the\r\nmorning of the 28th. Brigadier-General Burrows, who had two horses\r\nshot under him during the engagement, was amongst the last to reach\r\nKandahar.\r\n\r\nThis lamentable story imparted to me by Stewart almost took my breath\r\naway, and we eagerly discussed the situation as we rode back together\r\nto Sherpur. It was impossible to predict how the news would affect\r\nthe recent arrangements entered into with Abdur Rahman, or what the\r\nattitude of the tribesmen would be; but we agreed that, whatever might\r\nhappen in our immediate neighbourhood, the only means of affording\r\nspeedy relief to the Kandahar garrison was by sending a force from\r\nKabul.\r\n\r\nIt soon, however, became apparent, by telegrams received from Simla,\r\nthat the Government were in doubt as to the best course to pursue, and\r\nlooked to Quetta rather than Kabul as the place from which Kandahar\r\ncould be most conveniently and rapidly succoured. This was not\r\naltogether surprising, for the authorities naturally hesitated to\r\nweaken Kabul until matters had been finally settled with Abdur Rahman,\r\nand it was only to be expected that, after what had occurred at\r\nMaiwand, they should be alarmed at the idea of a force being cut\r\noff from all communication with India during the four weeks, or\r\nthereabouts, it would take to reach Kandahar. But there was really\r\nno alternative, for, as Major-General Phayre[4] (commanding in\r\nBaluchistan) reported,[5] the troops available for Field Service were\r\nbut few in number, it would require at least fifteen days to equip\r\nthem, and there was no organized transport at hand, the animals having\r\nbeen sent to distant grazing grounds on account of the scarcity of\r\nwater and forage.\r\n\r\nI knew nothing as to the actual condition of the troops in\r\nBaluchistan, except that, as belonging to the Bombay Presidency, they\r\ncould not be composed of the best fighting races, and I had a strong\r\nfeeling that it would be extremely unwise to make use of any but the\r\nmost proved Native soldiers against Ayub Khan's superior numbers,\r\nelated as his men must be with their victory at Maiwand.\r\n\r\nThe disaster to our arms caused, as was to be expected, considerable\r\nexcitement all along the border; indeed, throughout India the\r\nannouncement produced a certain feeling of uneasiness--a mere surface\r\nripple--but enough to make those who remembered the days of the Mutiny\r\nanxious for better news from the north.\r\n\r\nTo me it seemed of such supreme importance that Kandahar should be\r\nrelieved without delay, and the reverse to our arms retrieved, that\r\nI made up my mind to communicate my views to the Viceroy through\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief, in the hope that, when he realized that a\r\nthoroughly efficient force was ready and willing to start from Kabul,\r\nhe would no longer hesitate as to what was best to do.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th July, I dined with Stewart, and, leaving his mess-tent\r\nat an early hour, I retired to my own quarters, and wrote out the\r\nfollowing telegram in cipher, but, before despatching it, I showed it\r\nto Stewart, for, although I knew that his views were in accord with\r\nmine, I could not with propriety have sent it without his knowledge:\r\n\r\n    'To Major-General Greaves,[6] Adjutant-General in India, Simla.\r\n\r\n    'Kabul,\r\n    '_30th July,_ 1880.\r\n\r\n    'Personal and secret. I strongly recommend that a force be sent\r\n    from this to Kandahar. Stewart has organized a very complete one\r\n    consisting of nine regiments of Infantry, three of Cavalry, and\r\n    three Mountain batteries. This will suffice to overcome all\r\n    opposition _en route_; it will have the best possible effect\r\n    on the country, and will be ready to go anywhere on reaching\r\n    Kandahar, being fully equipped in all respects. He proposes\r\n    sending me in command.\r\n\r\n    'I am sure that but few Bombay regiments are able to cope with\r\n    Afghans, and once the Kabul Field Force leaves this country, the\r\n    chance of sending a thoroughly reliable and well-equipped column\r\n    will be lost. The movement of the remainder of the Kabul troops\r\n    towards India should be simultaneous with the advance of my\r\n    division towards Kandahar, it being most desirable to limit the\r\n    area of our responsibilities as soon as possible; at the same\r\n    time, it is imperative that we should now show our strength\r\n    throughout Afghanistan. The withdrawal, under existing\r\n    circumstances, of the whole force from Kabul to India would\r\n    certainly be misunderstood, both in Afghanistan and elsewhere. You\r\n    need have no fears about my division. It can take care of itself,\r\n    and will reach Kandahar under the month. I will answer for the\r\n    loyalty and good feeling of the Native portion, and would propose\r\n    to inform them that, as soon as matters have been satisfactorily\r\n    settled at Kandahar, they will be sent straight back to India.\r\n    Show this to Lyall.'\r\n\r\nExaggerated reports of the Maiwand affair being rife in the Kabul\r\nbazaars, which were daily becoming crowded with armed Afghans from\r\nAbdur Rahman's camp, and the prospect of troops having to leave at\r\nonce for Kandahar, made it more than ever necessary to bring the\r\nnegotiations with the new Amir to a speedy conclusion. It was\r\naccordingly arranged that Mr. Griffin should meet him at Zimma, about\r\nsixteen miles from Kabul. This interview had the happiest results,\r\nand must have been extremely gratifying to Mr. Griffin, whom we all\r\nheartily congratulated on the successful ending to the very delicate\r\nand difficult negotiations which he had carried on with so much skill\r\nand patience.\r\n\r\nIn taking leave of His Highness, Mr. Griffin invited him to come\r\nto the British camp the following day to be received by Sir Donald\r\nStewart. Abdur Rahman himself was quite willing to come, and some of\r\nhis supporters were in favour of his doing so, but others vehemently\r\nopposed the idea, and 'swore by their faith they would leave him if he\r\npersisted.' After a stormy meeting with his Chiefs, the Amir wrote\r\nto Mr. Griffin as follows: 'If you really wish me to come to you,\r\nirrespective of the opinion of the people, I am quite ready to do\r\nso. Please write and let me know your wishes. I am in the hands of\r\nignorant fools, who do not know their own interests, good or bad. What\r\ncan I do? I am most anxious to meet you.'\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of this note Stewart decided that it would be impolitic\r\nto press for an interview, for instead of strengthening the Amir, as\r\nhad been the intention, it was evident it would have the opposite\r\neffect, so the meeting was given up.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 3rd August the telegram arrived from Lord Ripon,\r\nwhich I had been so anxiously expecting, authorizing the despatch of a\r\nforce to Kandahar, and directing that I should be placed in command.\r\n\r\nI heard afterwards that my message to the Adjutant-General was\r\nreceived at Simla at a most opportune moment. Lyall took it without\r\ndelay to Lord Ripon, who from the first had been in favour of a force\r\nbeing sent from Kabul, but had refrained from ordering the movement\r\nin deference to the views held by some members of his Council, whose\r\nlonger experience of India, His Excellency considered, entitled their\r\nopinions to be treated with respect.\r\n\r\nI set to work at once to organize the column which I was to have the\r\ngreat honour of commanding. In this most congenial duty I received\r\nevery possible assistance and encouragement from Stewart; he gave me\r\ncarte-blanche, and I should only have had myself to blame if every\r\nunit had not been as efficiently equipped as circumstances would\r\nadmit.\r\n\r\nI wished that the force should be composed, as far as possible, of\r\nthose who had served with me throughout the campaign; but as some of\r\nthe regiments (more especially Native corps) had been away from their\r\nhomes for two years, and had had more than their share of fighting,\r\nbesides having suffered heavy losses in action and through sickness, I\r\nconsidered it right to consult their commanders before detailing the\r\ntroops. With the exception of three, who thought that their regiments\r\nhad been long enough away from India, all, to my great delight,\r\neagerly responded to my call, and I took upon myself to promise the\r\nmen that they should not be left to garrison Kandahar, but should be\r\nsent back to India as soon as the fighting ceased.\r\n\r\nWhen the several regiments were decided upon, every man not likely to\r\nstand the strain of prolonged forced marches was weeded out, and the\r\nscale of baggage, tents, and impedimenta was reduced to a minimum.[7]\r\n\r\nI had no fear as to the officers and men ably and cheerfully\r\nperforming their part of the task; we had been long enough together to\r\nenable us thoroughly to understand and trust each other, and I felt\r\nthat I could depend upon each and all to respond heartily to whatever\r\ncall I might make upon them.\r\n\r\nThe question of supplies was my greatest anxiety, and I had many\r\nconsultations with my experienced Commissariat officer, Major Badcock,\r\nbefore I could feel satisfied in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe transport, as I have already recorded, was in good order; it was\r\nfortunate that the soldiers had been practised in loading, leading,\r\nand tending the animals, for the Afghan drivers deserted to a man a\r\nmarch or two from Kabul, and the Hazaras followed their example on\r\nreaching their own country. Sir Donald Stewart's account of the\r\ntroubles he had encountered during his march from Kandahar was not\r\nvery encouraging, and I should have been glad if I could have taken a\r\nlarger amount of supplies;[8] but on this point I had to be guided by\r\nthe number of animals that could be allotted to the column, which was\r\nnecessarily limited, as carriage had to be provided simultaneously for\r\nthe withdrawal of the rest of the army of occupation.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the force placed at my disposal consisted of 9,986\r\nmen of all ranks and eighteen guns, divided into three brigades of\r\nInfantry, one brigade of Cavalry, and three batteries of Mountain\r\nArtillery. There were, besides, over 8,000 followers[9] and 2,300\r\nhorses and gun-mules.\r\n\r\nIt was designated the Kabul-Kandahar Field Force.\r\n\r\nMajor-General J. Ross, C.B., was given the command of the Infantry\r\ndivision, his three Brigadier-Generals being Herbert Macpherson, T.D.\r\nBaker, and Charles Macgregor. Brigadier-General Hugh Gough commanded\r\nthe Cavalry brigade; Colonel Alured Johnson the Artillery; while\r\nColonel Æ. Perkins held the position of Commanding Royal Engineer;\r\nDeputy-Surgeon-General J. Hanbury that of Principal Medical Officer;\r\nand Lieutenant-Colonel E.F. Chapman, Chief of the Staff.\r\n\r\nFrom the detail of the force given below,[10] it will be seen that\r\nthere was no wheeled Artillery, and that the number of guns was not\r\nin proportion to the strength of the other branches. This was my own\r\ndoing; I was pressed to take more and heavier guns, but, after due\r\nconsideration, I decided that I would only have Mountain batteries. We\r\ncould not tell how long the Kandahar garrison would be able to hold\r\nout, so that our first object must be to reach that place with the\r\nleast possible delay, and wheeled Artillery would, in a country where\r\nthere were practically no roads, have only prevented our moving as\r\nrapidly as we might otherwise have done.\r\n\r\nFor the equipment of the force, inclusive of carriage for footsore\r\nsoldiers[11] and followers, and allowing ten per cent. spare, more\r\nthan 8,000[12] animals were required.\r\n\r\nFortunately, it turned out that a fair amount of Indian corn in the\r\near was almost everywhere procurable, which was so nutritious that a\r\nlarge majority of the Cavalry horses and transport animals reached\r\nKandahar in excellent condition.\r\n\r\nThroughout the march great difficulties were experienced in procuring\r\nfood, but they were always overcome, with the able assistance of Major\r\nHastings and his political staff,[13] and by means of the admirable\r\narrangements made by the Commissariat[14] and Transport[15] officers,\r\nwho were quite untiring, and after the longest march, and with the\r\nprospect of having to start again at an early hour the following\r\nmorning, had often to work far into the night.\r\n\r\nThe want of fuel was our chief drawback. We had on many occasions to\r\npurchase houses and pull them to pieces for the sake of the wood to be\r\ngot out of them, and frequently there was nothing to cook with save\r\ntiny roots of southernwood, which had to be dug out and collected\r\nafter a long day's march before the men could prepare their food and\r\nsatisfy their hunger.\r\n\r\nOne day's corn was carried by each animal in addition to the ordinary\r\nload, and as far as Ghazni grain was tolerably plentiful; beyond that\r\nwe had to depend for forage on the crops still standing. At the end of\r\nthe day's march, certain fields were told off to the several brigades;\r\nfrom these all that was required was cut and carried away, the fields\r\nwere then measured and assessed, and compensation was awarded by the\r\npolitical officers, who also adjusted all claims on account of wrecked\r\nhouses, and fruit, vegetables, etc., brought in for the troops.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 8th August, the force moved into camp by brigades, my\r\nHead-Quarters being with the first and third Infantry brigades at\r\nBeni Hissar, on the way to the Logar valley, which route I had chosen\r\ninstead of the slightly shorter line by Maidan, on account of the\r\ngreater facility it afforded for supplies.\r\n\r\nSir Donald Stewart paid us a farewell visit in the afternoon, and at 6\r\na.m. the following morning we began the march to Kandahar.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Sirdar Sher Ali had been appointed Governor of Kandahar\r\nby the Amir Yakub Khan after the treaty of Gandamak, and had since\r\nassisted Sir Donald Stewart in the civil administration of the\r\nprovince.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Local Native levies.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3:\r\n\r\n                                 _Killed_      _Missing_\r\n  British officers                   20             9\r\n     \"    troops                    290            48\r\n  Native     \"                      624           118\r\n                                    ---           ---\r\n                                    934           175\r\n                           Total, 1,109\r\n\r\nOf the regimental followers 331 were killed and 7 were missing; 455\r\ntransport followers and drivers were reported as killed or missing,\r\nbut a number of these, being Afghans, probably joined the enemy.\r\n\r\nA large quantity of arms and ammunition was lost, including over 1,000\r\nrifles and carbines, and 600 or 700 swords and bayonets.\r\n\r\n201 horses were killed, and 1,676 camels, 355 ponies, 24 mules, 291\r\ndonkeys, and 79 bullocks, were not forthcoming.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Afterwards General Sir Robert Phayre, G.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: General Phayre reported on the 28th July that there\r\nwere only seven Native regiments in Baluchistan, three of which were\r\nrequired for the lines of communication, leaving only four available\r\nfor Field Service; and that a battalion of British Infantry and a\r\nbattery of Field Artillery required for his column were a long way\r\noff, being still in Sind.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Now General Sir George Greaves, G.C.B., G.C.M.C.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7:\r\n\r\n  Each British  soldier was allowed for kit and\r\n  camp-equipage,\r\n  including great-coat and waterproof sheet            30 lbs.\r\n  Each Native soldier                                  20  \"\r\n  Each public and private follower                     10  \"\r\n  Each European officer                                 1 mule.\r\n  Every eight officers for mess                         1  \"\r\n  Each staff-officer for office purposes               80 lbs.\r\n  Each Native officer                                  30  \"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: The amount of supplies taken with the force was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  FOR BRITISH TROOPS.\r\n\r\n  Bread-stuff                                           5 days.\r\n  Preserved vegetables                                 15  \"\r\n  Tea, sugar, salt, and rum                            30  \"\r\n\r\n  FOR NATIVE TROOPS AND FOLLOWERS.\r\n\r\n  Flour                                                 5 days\r\n  _Dal_ and salt                                       30  \"\r\n  Rum for spirit-drinking men                           8  \"\r\n\r\n  Sheep, ten days' supply for British troops and four issues for Native\r\n  troops, with 20 per cent. spare.

She had taken our children to England a few months\r\nbefore, thinking that the war in Afghanistan was over, and that I\r\nwould soon be able to follow.\r\n\r\nFour days brought us to the end of the Logar valley, a distance of\r\nforty-six miles. So far the country was easy and supplies plentiful. I\r\nthought it wise, however, not to attempt long distances at first, that\r\nboth men and animals might become gradually hardened before entering\r\non the difficult and scantily cultivated ground between Ghazni and\r\nKelat-i-Ghilzai, where I knew that forced marches were inevitable, and\r\nthat their powers of endurance would be sorely taxed. Moreover, it\r\nwas necessary to begin quietly, and organize some system by which\r\nconfusion in the crowded camping-grounds might be avoided, and the\r\nphysical strain upon everyone lightened as much as possible.\r\n\r\nWhen it is remembered that the daily supply for over 18,000 men and\r\n11,000 animals had to be drawn from the country after arrival in camp,\r\nthat food had to be distributed to every individual, that the fuel\r\nwith which it was cooked had often to be brought from long distances,\r\nand that a very limited time was available for the preparation of\r\nmeals and for rest, it will readily be understood how essential it was\r\nthat even the stupidest follower should be able to find his place in\r\ncamp speedily, and that everyone should know exactly what to do and\r\nhow to set about doing it.\r\n\r\nOn the march and in the formation of the camps the same principles\r\nwere, as far as possible, applied each day. The 'rouse' sounded at\r\n2.45 a.m., and by four o'clock tents had been struck, baggage loaded\r\nup, and everything was ready for a start.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, the Cavalry covered the movement at a distance of\r\nabout five miles, two of the four regiments being in front, with the\r\nother two on either flank. Two of the Infantry brigades came next,\r\neach accompanied by a Mountain battery; then followed the field\r\nhospitals, Ordnance and Engineer parks, treasure, and the baggage,\r\nmassed according to the order in which the brigades were moving. The\r\nthird Infantry brigade with its Mountain battery and one or two troops\r\nof Cavalry formed the rear guard.\r\n\r\nA halt of ten minutes was made at the end of each hour, which at eight\r\no'clock was prolonged to twenty minutes to give time for a hasty\r\nbreakfast. Being able to sleep on the shortest notice, I usually took\r\nadvantage of these intervals to get a nap, awaking greatly refreshed\r\nafter a few minutes' sound sleep.\r\n\r\nOn arrival at the resting-place for the night, the front face of the\r\ncamp was told off to the brigade on rear guard, and this became the\r\nleading brigade of the column on the next day's march. Thus every\r\nbrigade had its turn of rear guard duty, which was very arduous, more\r\nparticularly after leaving Ghazni, the troops so employed seldom\r\nreaching the halting-ground before six or seven o'clock in the\r\nevening, and sometimes even later.\r\n\r\nOne of the most troublesome duties of the rear guard was to prevent\r\nthe followers from lagging behind, for it was certain death for anyone\r\nwho strayed from the shelter of the column; numbers of Afghans always\r\nhovered about on the look-out for plunder, or in the hope of being\r\nable to send a Kafir, or an almost equally-detested Hindu, to eternal\r\nperdition. Towards the end of the march particularly, this duty became\r\nmost irksome, for the wretched followers were so weary and footsore\r\nthat they hid themselves in ravines, making up their minds to die, and\r\nentreating, when discovered and urged to make an effort, to be left\r\nwhere they were. Every baggage animal that could possibly be spared\r\nwas used to carry the worn-out followers; but notwithstanding this and\r\nthe care taken by officers and men that none should be left behind,\r\ntwenty of these poor creatures were lost, besides four Native\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nThe variation of temperature (at times as much as eighty degrees\r\nbetween day and night) was most trying to the troops, who had to carry\r\nthe same clothes whether the thermometer was at freezing-point at\r\ndawn or at 110° Fahr. at mid-day. Scarcity of water, too, was a great\r\ntrouble to them, while constant sand-storms, and the suffocating\r\ndust raised by the column in its progress, added greatly to their\r\ndiscomfort.\r\n\r\nDaily reports regarding the health of the troops, followers, and\r\ntransport animals were brought to me each evening, and I made it my\r\nbusiness to ascertain how many men had fallen out during the day, and\r\nwhat had been the number of casualties amongst the animals.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th August the Head-Quarters and main body of the force halted\r\nto allow the Cavalry and the second Infantry brigade to push on and\r\nget clear over the Zamburak Kotal (8,100 feet high) before the rest\r\nof the column attempted its ascent. This kotal presented a serious\r\nobstacle to our rapid progress, the gradient being in many places one\r\nin four, and most difficult for the baggage animals; but by posting\r\nstaff officers at intervals to control the flow of traffic, and by\r\nopening out fresh paths to relieve the pressure, we got over it much\r\nmore quickly than I had expected.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th we reached Ghazni, ninety-eight miles from Kabul, a place\r\nof peculiar interest to me from the fact that it was for his share in\r\nits capture, forty-one years before, that my father was given the C.B.\r\n\r\nI was met by the Governor, who handed me the keys of the fortress, and\r\nI placed my own guards and sentries in and around the city to prevent\r\ncollisions between the inhabitants and our troops, and also to make\r\nsure that our demands for supplies were complied with. Up to this\r\npoint we had been fairly well off for food, forage, and water.\r\n\r\nOur next march was across a barren, inhospitable track for twenty\r\nmiles to a place called Yarghati. On the way we passed Ahmedkhel,\r\nwhere Sir Donald Stewart won his victory; the name had been changed\r\nby the Natives to 'the Resting-place of Martyrs,' and the numerous\r\nfreshly-covered-in graves testified to the _ghazis'_ heavy losses. The\r\nremains of the few British soldiers, who had been buried where they\r\nhad fallen, had been desecrated, and the bones were exposed to view\r\nand scattered about.\r\n\r\nAt Chardeh, our next halting-place, a communication from Colonel\r\nTanner, Commanding at Kelat-i-Ghilzai, was brought to me by a Native\r\nmessenger; it was dated the 12th August, and informed me that Kandahar\r\nwas closely invested, but that the garrison had supplies for two\r\nmonths and forage for fifteen days.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st we arrived at a point thirty miles from Kelat-i-Ghilzai,\r\nwhence we opened heliograph communication with that place, and were\r\ntold of an unsuccessful sortie made from Kandahar five days before, in\r\nwhich General Brooke and eight other British officers had been killed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROSSING THE ZAMBURAK KOTAL.\r\n_From a painting by the Chevalier Desanges._]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd Kelat-i-Ghilzai was reached. The garrison[1] had been well\r\ntaken care of by Colonel Tanner,[2] and a large quantity of food for\r\nman and beast had been collected; but I thought it unadvisable\r\nat present to continue to hold the place, and have to keep open\r\ncommunication between it and Kandahar, and as I could see no\r\ncompensating advantage in doing so, I determined to withdraw the\r\ntroops and take them along with me.\r\n\r\nColonel Tanner's report satisfied me there was no immediate danger to\r\nbe apprehended at Kandahar, so I decided to halt for one day; both men\r\nand animals greatly needed rest after a continuous march of 225 miles.\r\n\r\nI had endeavoured to keep the Government of India informed of my\r\nprogress by a message from Ghazni, and one from Oba Karez on the\r\n18th August, but neither reached its destination. I now despatched a\r\nmessage which was more successful, and was delivered at Simla on the\r\n30th August. It was as follows:\r\n\r\n    'KELAT-I-GHILZAI,\r\n    '_23rd August,_ 1880.\r\n\r\n    'The force under my command arrived here this morning. The\r\n    authorities at Kandahar having stated on the 17th instant that\r\n    they have abundant supplies and can make forage last until\r\n    1st September, I halt to-morrow to rest the troops, and more\r\n    especially the transport animals and camp-followers. The force\r\n    left Ghazni on the 16th, and has marched 136 miles during the last\r\n    eight days; the troops are in good health and spirits. From this I\r\n    purpose moving by regular-stages, so that the men may arrive fresh\r\n    at Kandahar. I hope to be in heliographic communication with\r\n    Kandahar from Robat, distant twenty miles, on the 29th. If General\r\n    Phayre reaches Takht-i-Pul, I should also hope to communicate with\r\n    him and arrange a combined movement on Kandahar. I am taking the\r\n    Kelat-i-Ghilzai garrison with me, making the Fort over to Mahomed\r\n    Sadik Khan, a Toki Chief, who had charge of the place when we\r\n    arrived in 1879; the present Governor, Sirdar Sherindil Khan,\r\n    refuses to remain. We have met with no opposition during the\r\n    march, and have been able to make satisfactory arrangements for\r\n    supplies, especially forage, which at this season is plentiful.\r\n    The Cavalry horses and Artillery mules are in excellent order; our\r\n    casualties to date are, one soldier 72nd Highlanders, one sepoy\r\n    23rd Pioneers, one 2nd Sikhs, two sepoys 3rd Sikhs dead; one sepoy\r\n    4th Gurkhas, two sepoys 24th Punjab Native Infantry, one Duffadar\r\n    3rd Punjab Cavalry missing; six camp-followers dead, five missing.\r\n    The missing men have, I fear, been murdered. I telegraphed from\r\n    Ghazni on the 15th, and from Oba Karez on the 18th August.'\r\n\r\nI wrote also to Major-General Phayre, telling him of the date on\r\nwhich I expected to reach Kandahar, and that if I heard of his being\r\nanywhere near I would arrange my movements to suit his, in order that\r\nthe two forces might make a combined attack on Ayub Khan's position.\r\n\r\nAs I was afraid the supplies at Kandahar would be insufficient for the\r\nadditional troops about to be collected there, I sent General Phayre\r\na memorandum[3] of the amount of food required daily by my force, and\r\nbegged him to get pushed up from the rear such articles as were more\r\nparticularly wanted. I pointed out that we were badly off for boots,\r\nand that the 92nd Highlanders had only one hundred greatcoats fit for\r\nwear, which were used by the men on night duties.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th we marched to Jaldak, seventeen miles, and the same\r\ndistance the next day to Tirandaz, where I received a letter from\r\nLieutenant-General Primrose, informing me that Ayub Khan had raised\r\nthe siege on the 23rd, and was entrenching himself at Mazra, beyond\r\nthe Baba Wali Kotal, in the valley of the Arghandab.\r\n\r\nI awoke on the morning of the 27th feeling very unwell, and soon found\r\nI was in for an attack of fever. The heat during the day was becoming\r\nmore and more overpowering as we proceeded south, and I had lately\r\nbeen feeling somewhat knocked up by it and by exposure to the sun. I\r\nhad now to give in for the time being, and was compelled to perform\r\nthe march in a doolie, a most ignominious mode of conveyance for a\r\nGeneral on service; but there was no help for it, for I could not sit\r\na horse.\r\n\r\nThat day the 3rd Bengal and 3rd Punjab Cavalry marched thirty-four\r\nmiles to Robat, in order to establish direct heliographic\r\ncommunication with Kandahar. The main body halted about half-way, when\r\nI again reported progress as follows:\r\n\r\n    SHAHR-I-SAFA,\r\n    '_27th August, 1880._\r\n\r\n    'My force arrived here to-day. I received a letter yesterday,\r\n    dated 25th, from Colonel St. John. He writes: \"The rumours of the\r\n    approach of your force have been sufficient to relieve the city\r\n    from investment. On Monday night the villages on the east and\r\n    south were abandoned by their mixed garrisons of _ghazis_ and\r\n    regulars. Yesterday morning Ayub struck his camp, and marched to a\r\n    position on the Arghandab, between Baba Wali and Sheikh Chela,\r\n    due north of the city, and separated from it by a range of rocky\r\n    hills. He has about 4,000 Infantry regulars, six 12-pounders and\r\n    two 9-pounders rifled, four 6-pounder smooth-bore batteries, and\r\n    one 4-pounder battery, 2,000 sowars, and perhaps twice that number\r\n    of _ghazis_, of whom a third have firearms. The Kizilbashes and\r\n    Kohistanis in his army, about 1,200 Infantry and 300 Cavalry,\r\n    offered to desert and join us directly we made a show of attack.\r\n    They are at last aware of Abdur Rahman's succession, but I think\r\n    Ayub will remain unmolested until the arrival of the Kabul force,\r\n    provided he waits, which is unlikely. He will, I expect, strike\r\n    away north into Khakrez, on which line a vigorous pursuit will\r\n    give us his guns. Maclaine, Royal Horse Artillery, is still a\r\n    prisoner; I am making every effort to obtain his release, but I am\r\n    not very hopeful of success. This morning, the 25th, I went to the\r\n    field of the unlucky sortie of the 16th, and found the bodies of\r\n    the poor fellows who fell there, some forty in number; they will\r\n    be buried this afternoon. All the wounded are doing well. No\r\n    signs or tidings of Phayre.\" General Gough, with two regiments of\r\n    Cavalry, is at Robat; they are in heliographic communication\r\n    with Kandahar. General Primrose heliographs that Ayub Khan has\r\n    entrenched his camp at Baba Wali. The force marches for Robat\r\n    to-morrow, seventeen miles distant from Kandahar.'\r\n\r\nThe following day the column joined the two Cavalry regiments at\r\nRobat, where I was met by Lieutenant-Colonel St. John, from whom I\r\nheard that Ayub Khan was likely to make a stand. I thought it prudent,\r\ntherefore, to halt on Sunday, the 29th, and divide the last twenty\r\nmiles into two short marches, in order that the men and animals might\r\narrive as fresh as possible, and fit for any work which might be\r\nrequired of them; for should Ayub Khan retire towards Herat, he would\r\nhave to be followed up, and his army attacked and defeated wherever we\r\nmight overtake him.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Robat, a letter arrived from General Phayre, which put\r\nan end to all hope of his force being able to co-operate with mine,\r\nfor his leading brigade, he wrote, had only just got to the Kohjak\r\nPass. This was to be regretted, but it was unavoidable. I was well\r\naware of the strenuous efforts the gallant Commander had made to\r\nrelieve the beleaguered garrison, and I knew if co-operation had been\r\npossible it would have been effected.\r\n\r\nWe encamped at Momund on the 30th, whence I sent the following\r\ntelegram to Simla:\r\n\r\n    'My force arrived here to-day; we march to Kandahar to-morrow.\r\n    General Primrose heliographs that a letter from Ayub's camp brings\r\n    information that the mother of the late Heir-Apparent, Abdulla\r\n    Jan, with other ladies, has been sent to Zamindawar. Arrival of\r\n    the young Musa Jan in Ayub's camp is confirmed. Hashim Khan is\r\n    also there. The position is being strengthened, especially on\r\n    the Pir Paimal side, where two guns have been placed with two\r\n    regiments. From further information, I learn that the Baba\r\n    Wali Kotal is occupied by three regiments and two guns. The\r\n    Kotal-i-Murcha is held by the Kabul regiments, and Ayub's own camp\r\n    is at Mazra, where it is said that the majority of his guns are\r\n    parked. I propose to encamp the Infantry to the west of Kandahar\r\n    immediately under the walls, and the Cavalry under the walls to\r\n    the south. Should I hear that Ayub contemplates flight, I shall\r\n    attack without delay. If, on the contrary, he intends to resist,\r\n    I shall take my own time. The country he is occupying is, from\r\n    description and map, extremely difficult and easily defensible,\r\n    and each separate advance will require careful study and\r\n    reconnaissance to prevent unnecessary loss of life.'\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 31st we marched into Kandahar, just over 313\r\nmiles from Kabul. The fever, which had attacked me rather sharply, had\r\nleft me extremely weak, and I was unable to ride the whole way. I got\r\non my horse, however, some distance from Kandahar to meet Generals\r\nPrimrose, Burrows, and Nuttall, who came out to receive the column. As\r\nwe approached the city, the whole garrison turned out and gave us a\r\nhearty welcome; officers and men, Native and British, crowded round\r\nus, loud in their expressions of gratitude for our having come so\r\nquickly to their assistance. We, on our side, were all anxiety\r\nto learn the particulars about Maiwand, how they had fared while\r\ninvested, and all they could tell us of Ayub Khan, his position,\r\nstrength of his army, etc.\r\n\r\nI confess to being very greatly surprised, not to use a stronger\r\nexpression, at the demoralized condition of the greater part of the\r\ngarrison;[4] there were notable exceptions,[5] but the general bearing\r\nof the troops reminded me of the people at Agra in 1857. They\r\nseemed to consider themselves hopelessly defeated, and were utterly\r\ndespondent; they never even hoisted the Union Jack until the relieving\r\nforce was close at hand. The same excuses could not, however, be made\r\nfor them, who were all soldiers by profession, as we had felt inclined\r\nto make for the residents at Agra, a great majority of whom were\r\nwomen, children, and civilians. The walls[6] which completely\r\nsurrounded Kandahar were so high and thick as to render the city\r\nabsolutely impregnable to any army not equipped with a regular\r\nsiege-train. Scaling-ladders had been prepared by the enemy, and\r\nthere was an idea that an assault would be attempted; but for British\r\nsoldiers to have contemplated the possibility of Kandahar being taken\r\nby an Afghan army showed what a miserable state of depression and\r\ndemoralization they were in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map: SKETCH OF THE ROUTE TAKEN ON THE MARCH FROM KABUL\r\nTO KANDAHAR. AUGUST. 1880.]\r\n\r\nI halted the column for two hours outside the south wall of the city,\r\nwhere it was sheltered from the enemy's fire, Ayub Khan's position\r\nbeing within long range directly north of Kandahar. While the men\r\nrested and breakfasted, and the baggage animals were being unloaded,\r\nfed, and watered, I went into the citadel to talk matters over with\r\nGeneral Primrose and Colonel St. John, and inquire whether there was\r\nsufficient accommodation for the sick men of my force, numbering 940,\r\nwho needed to be taken into hospital. The thermometer now registered\r\n105° Fahr. in tents during the day, but the nights were still bitterly\r\ncold, and the sudden changes of temperature were extremely trying to\r\npeople in bad health.\r\n\r\nOn the advice of Lieutenant-Colonel Chapman, whose intimate\r\nacquaintance with the neighbourhood of Kandahar, gained while serving\r\non Sir Donald Stewart's staff, was now most valuable to me, I\r\ndetermined to take up a position to the west of the city, with my\r\nright on the cantonment and my left touching Old Kandahar. This\r\nenabled me to cover the city, gave me command of a good supply of\r\nwater, and placed me within striking distance of Ayub Khan's camp.\r\n\r\nAt 10 a.m. the first and third brigades moved off and occupied Piquet\r\nHill, Karez Hill, and the north-east spur of the hill above Old\r\nKandahar. A few shots were fired at the advance guard from distant\r\norchards, and the ground proved to be within range of some of the\r\nenemy's Field-pieces on the Baba Wali Kotal, but it was a case of\r\nHobson's choice, as water was not to be found anywhere else at a\r\ncome-at-able distance.\r\n\r\nLarge numbers of men were to be seen crowning the Baba Wali Kotal, and\r\nconstructing shelter-trenches along the crest of the low black ridge,\r\nwhich jutted out in a south-easterly direction from the more lofty\r\nrange on which the kotal is situated. Piquets were immediately sent to\r\noccupy the northern spur of the Kohkeran Hill commanding the road to\r\nGundigan, the village of Abbasabad, the Karez Hill, the village of\r\nChihal Dukhtaran, the greater and lesser Piquet Hills, and the village\r\nof Kalachi, all of which were found to be deserted.\r\n\r\nFrom a cursory examination of the ground, I satisfied myself that any\r\nattempt to carry the Baba Wali Kotal by direct attack must result in\r\nvery severe loss, and I determined to turn it. But before I could\r\ndecide how this could best be done, it was necessary to ascertain\r\nthe strength and precise extent of the Afghan position. I therefore\r\ndetailed a small party,[7] under the command of Brigadier-General Hugh\r\nGough, to make as complete a reconnaissance as time would allow. In\r\nthe meantime I despatched the following telegram to the authorities at\r\nSimla:\r\n\r\n    'KANDAHAR, _31st August,_ 1880.\r\n\r\n    'The force under my command arrived here this morning without\r\n    opposition. Enemy are said to be in considerable strength at\r\n    Mazra, but the ridge of hills which divides Kandahar from the\r\n    Arghandab completely covers their position, and at present I have\r\n    only been able to ascertain that the Baba Wali Kotal and one or\r\n    two other points on this ridge are held in great strength,\r\n    and that the enemy are busily engaged in defensive works.\r\n    Reconnaissances are now being conducted, and I shall soon, I hope,\r\n    be sufficiently acquainted with affairs generally to enable me to\r\n    arrange for an attack. The Kandahar garrison are in good health;\r\n    the horses and transport animals appear to be in good condition.\r\n    Major Vandeleur, 7th Fusiliers, has died of his wounds; the\r\n    remainder of the wounded, both officers and men, are generally\r\n    doing well. The troops from Kabul are in famous health and\r\n    spirits. The assurance of the safety of this garrison enabled\r\n    comparatively short marches to be made from Kelat-i-Ghilzai,\r\n    which much benefited both men and animals. The Cavalry horses and\r\n    Artillery mules are in excellent condition, and the transport\r\n    animals are, as a rule, in very fair order. General Primrose has\r\n    arranged for the sick of the force from Kabul being accommodated\r\n    inside the city; many of the cases are sore feet; none are\r\n    serious. To-morrow the telegraph line towards India will commence\r\n    to be re-constructed, and as General Phayre is probably on this\r\n    side of the Kohjak to-day, through communication should soon be\r\n    restored.'\r\n\r\nThe reconnaissance, which started at 1 p.m., proceeded towards the\r\nhigh ground immediately above the villages of Gundigan and Murghan.\r\nHere the Infantry and guns were halted, while the Cavalry advanced\r\nbetween two or three miles, avoiding the numerous orchards and\r\nenclosures, and coming out in front of Pir Paimal, which was found to\r\nbe strongly entrenched.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the enemy's fire along this line had been drawn, the 3rd\r\nBengal Cavalry fell back, admirably handled by their Commandant,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel A. Mackenzie. In the meantime, two guns of No.\r\n11 Battery 9th Brigade were brought into action, partly to test the\r\nrange, and partly to check the enemy, who were passing rapidly into\r\nthe gardens near Gundigan. The Infantry and Artillery then retired\r\nwithin the line of piquets, and the moment they began to fall back the\r\nAfghans came after them in great strength; they were so persistent\r\nthat I ordered the whole of the 3rd Brigade and part of the 1st\r\nBrigade under arms. The enemy, however, were unable to come to close\r\nquarters owing to the bold front shown by the 15th Sikhs, under the\r\ncommand of Lieutenant-Colonel Hennessy, and before dark the troops\r\nwere all back in camp, with a loss of five men killed and fifteen\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nFrom the information obtained by this reconnaissance, I found that it\r\nwas quite practicable to turn the Afghan right, and thus place myself\r\nin rear of the Baba Wali range; I decided, therefore, to attack the\r\nposition the following morning. It was too close to our camp to risk\r\ndelay. Moreover, I knew that the retrograde movement of Gough's small\r\nbody would be construed into a defeat by the enemy, who, if we did not\r\nmove at once, would assuredly think that we were afraid to take the\r\ninitiative, and would become correspondingly bold.\r\n\r\nI accordingly issued orders for the troops to breakfast at 7 a.m., and\r\nfor one day's cooked rations to be carried by the Infantry and two\r\ndays by the Cavalry and Horse Artillery. Brigades were to be in\r\nposition by eight o'clock, tents being previously struck and the\r\nbaggage stored in a walled enclosure.\r\n\r\nThe night passed quietly except for occasional bursts of musketry\r\nalong the line of piquets to the west, showing that the Afghans were\r\nholding the villages they had occupied the previous evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The garrison consisted of 2 guns of C/2, Royal Artillery,\r\n145 rifles of the 66th Foot, 100 of the 3nd Sind Horse, and the 2nd\r\nBaluch Regiment, 639 strong.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Now Lieutenant-General Sir Oriel Tanner, K.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Estimate of daily requirements for the Kabul-Kandahar\r\nField Force and the Kelat-i-Ghilzai garrison:\r\n\r\n  Europeans                  3,200\r\n  Native troops              8,000\r\n  Followers                  8,500\r\n  Horses                     2,300\r\n  Transport          --yabus 1,592,\r\n            mules and ponies 5,926,\r\n                        camels 400,\r\n                       donkeys 400.\r\n\r\n  Meat                       4,000 lbs.\r\n  Bread-stuff                   40 maunds.[*]\r\n  Vegetables                 4,000 lbs.\r\n  Rice                         800  \"\r\n  Salt                         133  \"\r\n  Sugar                        600  \"\r\n  Tea                          150  \"\r\n  Rum, 25 per cent.             80 gallons.\r\n  Atta                         320 maunds.\r\n  Dall                          51-1/2 \"\r\n  Ghee                          19-1/4 \"\r\n  Salt                           8-1/2 \"\r\n  Grain                        700     \"\r\n\r\n  A.

Briefly, it was to\r\nthreaten the enemy's left (the Baba Wali Kotal), and to attack in\r\nforce by the village of Pir Paimal.\r\n\r\nThe Infantry belonging to the Kabul column, upon whom devolved the\r\nduty of carrying the enemy's position, were formed up in rear of the\r\nlow hills which covered the front of our camp, their right being at\r\nPiquet Hill and their left resting on Chitral Zina. The Cavalry of the\r\nKabul column were drawn up in rear of the left, ready to operate by\r\nGundigan towards the head of the Arghandab, so as to threaten the\r\nrear of Ayub Khan's camp and his line of retreat in the direction of\r\nGirishk. Four guns of E Battery Royal Horse Artillery, two companies\r\nof the 2-7th Fusiliers, and four companies of the 28th Bombay\r\nInfantry, were placed at the disposal of Brigadier-General Hugh Gough,\r\nwhose orders were to occupy with these troops the position above\r\nGundigan, which had been so useful during the previous day's\r\nreconnaissance, and to push his Cavalry on to the Arghandab.\r\n\r\nGuards having been detailed for the protection of the city, the\r\nremainder of Lieutenant-General Primrose's troops were ordered to be\r\ndisposed as follows: Brigadier-General Daubeny's brigade to occupy the\r\nground between Piquet Hill and Chitral Zina as soon as the Infantry of\r\nthe Kabul-Kandahar Field Force advanced to the attack. The remnant of\r\nBrigadier-General Burrows's brigade, with No. 5 Battery, 11th Brigade\r\nRoyal Artillery, under Captain Hornsby, and the Cavalry under\r\nBrigadier-General Nuttall, to take up a position north of the\r\ncantonment, from which the 40-pounders could be brought to bear on\r\nthe Baba Wali Kotal, while the Cavalry could watch the pass, called\r\nKotal-i-Murcha, and cover the city.\r\n\r\nFrom an early hour it was clear that the enemy contemplated an\r\noffensive movement; the villages of Gundigan and Gundi Mulla Sahibdab\r\nwere being held in strength, and a desultory fire was brought to bear\r\non the British front from the orchards connecting these two villages\r\nand from the Baba Wali Kotal.\r\n\r\nThe Bombay Cavalry moved out at 7.30 a.m., and Daubeny's brigade at\r\neight o'clock. Burrows's troops followed, and shortly after 9 a.m.,\r\ntheir disposition being completed, Captain Hornsby opened fire upon\r\nthe kotal, which was one mass of _ghazis_.\r\n\r\nThis feint, made by General Primrose's troops, having had the effect I\r\nhad hoped, of attracting the enemy's attention, I gave the order\r\nfor Major-General Ross to make the real attack with the 1st and 2nd\r\nBrigades of his division. The 3rd Brigade, under Brigadier-General\r\nMacgregor, I placed in front of the village of Abbasabad, with the\r\ndouble object of being a reserve to the 1st and 2nd Brigades and of\r\nmeeting a possible counter-attack from the Baba Wali Kotal.\r\n\r\nRoss's orders were to advance against Gundi Mulla Sahibdad, capture\r\nthe village, and then drive the enemy from the enclosures which lay\r\nbetween it and the low spur of Pir Paimal hill. This duty he entrusted\r\nto Brigadier-General Macpherson, and he directed Brigadier-General\r\nBaker to advance to the west, to keep touch with the 1st Brigade, and\r\nto clear the gardens and orchards in his immediate front.\r\n\r\nGreig's 9-pounder and Robinson's 7-pounder (screw gun) batteries\r\ncovered the attack on Gundi Mulla Sahibdad, which was made by the\r\n2nd Gurkhas, under Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Battye, and the 92nd\r\nHighlanders, under Lieutenant-Colonel G. Parker, supported by the 23rd\r\nPioneers, under Lieutenant-Colonel H. Collett, and the 24th Punjab\r\nInfantry, under Colonel F. Norman. The village was carried with the\r\nutmost gallantry, Highlanders and Gurkhas, always friendly rivals in\r\nthe race for glory, by turns outstripping each other in their efforts\r\nto be first within its walls. The enemy sullenly and slowly withdrew,\r\na goodly number of _ghazis_ remaining to the very last to receive\r\na bayonet charge of the 92nd. Meanwhile, Baker's troops had been\r\nthreading their way through the narrow lanes and loop-holed enclosures\r\nwhich lay in the line of their spirited attack; the resistance they\r\nencountered was most stubborn, and it was during this advance that the\r\n72nd lost their dashing Commander, Lieutenant-Colonel F. Brownlow,[1]\r\nCaptain Frome, and Lance-Sergeant Cameron, the latter a grand specimen\r\nof a Highland soldier.\r\n\r\nIn the 2nd Brigade, the 72nd Highlanders and the 2nd Sikhs bore\r\nthe brunt of the fighting; they were the leading battalions, and\r\nfrequently had to fix bayonets to carry different positions or to\r\ncheck the desperate rushes of the Afghans.\r\n\r\nAfter continued and severe fighting, both leading brigades emerged\r\nat the point of the hill close to Pir Paimal, and, wheeling to their\r\nright, they pressed rapidly on, sweeping the enemy through the\r\nthickly-wooded gardens which covered the western slopes, until noon,\r\nwhen the whole of Pir Paimal was in our possession.[2]\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the advance the Afghans collected in great\r\nstrength on the low hills beneath the Baba Wali Kotal, evidently\r\npreparing for a rush on our guns; their leaders could be seen urging\r\nthem on, and a portion of them came down the hill, but the main body\r\napparently refused to follow, and remained on the crest until the\r\nposition was turned, when they at once retreated.\r\n\r\nHaving become assured of General Ross's complete success, and seeing\r\nthat there was now no necessity for detaining Macgregor's (the 3rd)\r\nbrigade to meet a counter-attack, I pushed on with it to join Ross,\r\nwho, however, knowing how thoroughly he could depend upon his troops,\r\nwithout waiting to be reinforced, followed up the retreating foe,\r\nuntil he reached an entrenched position at the other side of the Baba\r\nWali Kotal, where the Afghans made another most determined stand.\r\n_Ghazis_ in large numbers flocked to this spot from the rear, while\r\nthe guns on the kotal were turned round and brought to bear on our\r\nmen, already exposed to a heavy Artillery fire from behind the\r\nentrenched camp.\r\n\r\nIt now became necessary to take this position by storm, and\r\nrecognizing the fact with true soldierly instinct, Major White, who\r\nwas leading the advanced companies of the 92nd, called upon the men\r\nfor just one charge more 'to close the business.' The battery of screw\r\nguns had been shelling the position, and, under cover of its fire\r\nand supported by a portion of the 2nd Gurkhas and 23rd Pioneers, the\r\nHighlanders, responding with alacrity to their leader's call, dashed\r\nforward and drove the enemy from their entrenchments at the point of\r\nthe bayonet.[3]\r\n\r\nMajor White was the first to reach the guns, being closely followed\r\nby Sepoy Inderbir Lama, who, placing his rifle upon one of them,\r\nexclaimed, 'Captured in the name of the 2nd (Prince of Wales' Own)\r\nGurkhas!'\r\n\r\nWhilst the 1st Brigade was advancing towards the last position, a\r\nhalf-battalion of the 3rd Sikhs (belonging to the 2nd Brigade), under\r\nLieutenant-Colonel G. Money, charged a body of Afghans and captured\r\nthree guns.\r\n\r\nThe enemy were now absolutely routed, but, owing to the nature of the\r\nground, it was impossible for General Ross to realize how complete had\r\nbeen his victory, and he fully expected that the enemy would take up\r\na fresh position further on; he therefore ordered the 1st and 2nd\r\nBrigades to halt while they replenished their ammunition, and then\r\nproceeded for about a mile, when they suddenly came in sight of Ayub\r\nKhan's enormous camp. It was entirely deserted, and apparently stood\r\nas it had been left in the morning when the Afghans moved out to the\r\nattack. With his camp was captured the whole of Ayub Khan's Artillery,\r\nthirty-two pieces, including our two Horse Artillery guns[4] which had\r\nbeen taken at Maiwand on the 27th July.\r\n\r\nFurther pursuit by the Infantry being valueless, the 1st and 2nd\r\nBrigades halted on the far side of Mazra, where I with the 3rd Brigade\r\nshortly afterwards joined them.\r\n\r\nBrigadier-General Hugh Gough, having satisfied himself as to the\r\nsecurity of our left flank, scouted as far as Kohkeran, and then\r\nproceeded with the Cavalry of the Kabul-Kandahar Field Force to\r\nexecute the extended movement entrusted to him. He crossed the\r\nArghandab, and pushed round to get in front of the line of the enemy's\r\nretreat towards Khakrez. Some _ghazis_ and Irregular Afghan troops\r\nwere overtaken, but no Regular regiments were met with, the soldiers\r\nhaving, as is their custom, quickly divested themselves of their\r\nuniform and assumed the garb of harmless agriculturists.\r\n\r\nAyub Khan himself had fled early in the day with his principal\r\nSirdars.\r\n\r\nAs I rode into the abandoned camp, I was horrified to hear that the\r\nbody of Maclaine, the Horse Artillery officer who had been taken\r\nprisoner at Maiwand, was lying with the throat cut about forty yards\r\nfrom Ayub Khan's own tent. From what I could learn, the latter had\r\nnot actually ordered the murder, but as a word from him would have\r\nprevented it, he must be held responsible for the assassination of an\r\nofficer who had fallen into his hands as a prisoner of war.\r\n\r\nOur losses during the day comprised: killed, 3 British officers,[5]\r\n1 Native officer, and 36 men; wounded, 11 British officers, 4 Native\r\nofficers, and 195 men, 18 of whom succumbed to their wounds. It was\r\ndifficult to estimate the loss of the enemy, but it must have been\r\nheavy, as between Kandahar and the village of Pir Paimal alone 600\r\nbodies were buried by us.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the 1st Brigade, which remained at Mazra for the\r\nnight to protect the captured guns and stores, the troops all returned\r\nto camp before 9 p.m.[6]\r\n\r\nUtterly exhausted as I was from the hard day's work and the weakening\r\neffects of my late illness, the cheers with which I was greeted by the\r\ntroops as I rode into Ayub Khan's camp and viewed the dead bodies of\r\nmy gallant soldiers nearly unmanned me, and it was with a very big\r\nlump in my throat that I managed to say a few words of thanks to each\r\ncorps in turn. When I returned to Kandahar, and threw myself on the\r\nbed in the little room prepared for me, I was dead-beat and quite\r\nunequal to the effort of reporting our success to the Queen or to the\r\nViceroy. After an hour's rest, however, knowing how anxiously news\r\nfrom Kandahar was looked for both in England and India, I managed\r\nto pull myself together sufficiently to write out and despatch the\r\nfollowing telegram:\r\n\r\n    'KANDAHAR,\r\n    '_1st September, 1880_ (6 p.m.).\r\n\r\n    'Ayub Khan's army was to-day defeated and completely dispersed\r\n    with, I hope, comparatively slight loss on our side; his camp was\r\n    captured, the two lost guns of E Battery, B Brigade Royal Horse\r\n    Artillery were recovered, and several wheeled guns of various\r\n    calibre fell to the splendid Infantry of this force; the Cavalry\r\n    are still in pursuit. Our casualties are: 22nd Foot, Captain\r\n    Straton, killed; 72nd Highlanders, Lieutenant-Colonel Brownlow,\r\n    Captain Frome, killed, Captain Murray and Lieutenant Monro,\r\n    wounded, 7 men killed, 18 wounded; 92nd Highlanders, Lieutenants\r\n    Menzies and Donald Stewart wounded, 11 men killed and 39 wounded;\r\n    2nd Gurkhas, Lieutenant-Colonel Battye, and 2nd Sikhs, Major\r\n    Slater wounded. It is at present impossible to ascertain the\r\n    casualties amongst the Native troops, but I have no reason to\r\n    believe they are excessive; full details will be telegraphed\r\n    to-morrow. The quite recently murdered remains of Lieutenant\r\n    Maclaine, Royal Horse Artillery, were found on the arrival of the\r\n    British troops in Ayub Khan's camp. Ayub Khan is supposed to have\r\n    fled towards Herat.'\r\n\r\nIt can easily be imagined with what an intense sense of relief I awoke\r\non the morning of the 2nd September--the march had ended, Kandahar had\r\nbeen relieved, Ayub Khan's army had been beaten and dispersed, and\r\nthere was an adequate force in southern Afghanistan to prevent further\r\ndisturbances.\r\n\r\nAmongst the innumerable questions of detail which now confronted me\r\nwas the all-important one, and that which caused me greatest anxiety,\r\nof how the large body of troops hastily concentrated at Kandahar, and\r\nfor which the produce of the country was quite inadequate, were to be\r\nfed.\r\n\r\nNo supplies and very little forage were procurable between Quetta and\r\nKandahar, and in the neighbourhood of the latter place there was now\r\nhardly anything in the shape of food for man or beast to be had for\r\nlove or money, the resources of this part of the country having been\r\nquite exhausted. Relief could only be obtained by reducing the number\r\nof mouths to be fed, and with this object I scattered the troops in\r\ndifferent directions, to posts as far distant from each other as\r\npossible, consistent with safety; and in accordance with my promise to\r\nthe Kabul-Kandahar Field Force, that they should not be required to\r\ngarrison Kandahar when the fighting was at an end, I arranged to\r\ndespatch without delay to India the corps which had come with me from\r\nnorthern Afghanistan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKETCH OF THE BATTLE-FIELD OF KANDAHAR]\r\n\r\nOne column proceeded to Maiwand to inter the bodies of our soldiers\r\nwho fell on the 27th July. The Cavalry brigade moved with a number\r\nof sick men and transport animals to Kohkeran. Macgregor's brigade\r\nstarted for Quetta on the 8th, and was followed soon after by Baker's\r\nand Macpherson's brigades. I accompanied Macgregor in the hope that\r\nthe change to Quetta (where I remained about a month) would pick me\r\nup, and enable me to meet Lord Ripon's wish that I should retain the\r\ncommand in southern Afghanistan until some satisfactory settlement\r\ncould be arrived at.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Kandahar I issued an order thanking all ranks of the\r\nKabul-Kandahar Field Force for the work they had so nobly performed,\r\nand I had the gratification of acknowledging, on their behalf and my\r\nown, congratulatory messages from the Queen, the Duke of Cambridge,\r\nthe Marquis of Ripon, and many others. On the way to Quetta I had\r\nthe further gratification of being informed by the Viceroy that Her\r\nMajesty had been graciously pleased to make me a G.C.B., and to\r\nappoint me Commander-in-Chief of the Madras Army.\r\n\r\nI now heard that Abdur Rahman had been finally nominated Amir of\r\nKabul on the 10th August, and that immediately after the ceremony of\r\ninstallation Sir Donald Stewart had marched the whole British force\r\nof 6,678 men of all arms out of Kabul on their return to India. Sir\r\nDonald left Peshawar to take up his appointment of Military Member of\r\nCouncil at Simla on the 31st August, and by the 7th September the last\r\nof his troops had arrived at the former place, except one brigade left\r\nas a temporary measure in the Khyber Pass.\r\n\r\nAt Quetta I stayed with Sir Robert Sandeman, the capable Resident,\r\nwho by his great personal influence had done much to allay excitement\r\namongst the tribes, and to prevent serious trouble in Baluchistan\r\nand along the border. I had never before been to that part of the\r\nfrontier, and I was greatly impressed by the hold Sandeman had\r\nobtained over the country; he was intimately acquainted with every\r\nleading man, and there was not a village, however out of the way,\r\nwhich he had not visited. 'Sinniman _sahib_,' as the Natives called\r\nhim, had gained the confidence of the lawless Baluchis in a very\r\nremarkable manner, and it was mainly owing to his power over them that\r\nI was able to arrange with camel contractors to transport to Quetta\r\nand Kandahar the huge stocks of winter clothing, medical comforts,\r\ngrain, and the various requirements of an army in the field, which\r\nhad been brought by rail to Sibi, and had there remained for want of\r\ntransport to take them further on.\r\n\r\nAs the change to Quetta did not benefit me, and as I found that,\r\nowing to indifferent health, I was unable to carry on my duty with\r\nsatisfaction to myself, I applied to be relieved. My request was\r\nacceded to, and I started on the 12th October for India.\r\n\r\nRiding through the Bolan Pass I overtook most of the regiments of the\r\nKabul-Kandahar Field Force marching towards Sibi, thence to disperse\r\nto their respective destinations. As I parted with each corps in turn\r\nits band played 'Auld Lang Syne,' and I have never since heard that\r\nmemory-stirring air without its bringing before my mind's eye the last\r\nview I had of the Kabul-Kandahar Field Force. I fancy myself crossing\r\nand re-crossing the river which winds through the pass; I hear the\r\nmartial beat of drums and plaintive music of the pipes; and I see\r\nRiflemen and Gurkhas, Highlanders and Sikhs, guns and horses, camels\r\nand mules, with the endless following of an Indian army, winding\r\nthrough the narrow gorges, or over the interminable boulders which\r\nmade the passage of the Bolan so difficult and wearisome to man and\r\nbeast.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the feeling of sadness with which I said good-bye\r\nto the men who had done so much for me. I looked upon them all, Native\r\nas well as British, as my valued friends. And well I might, for never\r\nhad a Commander been better served. From first to last a grand spirit\r\nof _camaraderie_[7] pervaded all ranks. At the Peiwar Kotal, at\r\nCharasia, and during the fighting round Kabul, all were eager to close\r\nwith the enemy, no matter how great the odds against them. Throughout\r\nthe march from Kabul all seemed to be animated with but one desire, to\r\neffect, cost what it might in personal risk, fatigue, or discomfort,\r\nthe speedy release of their beleaguered fellow-soldiers in Kandahar;\r\nand the unflagging energy and perseverance of my splendid troops\r\nseemed to reach their full height, when they realized they were about\r\nto put forth their strength against a hitherto successful enemy. Their\r\nexemplary conduct, too, under circumstances often of the most\r\ntrying nature, cannot be praised in terms too strong or too full.\r\nNotwithstanding the provocation caused by the cruel murder of any\r\nstragglers who fell into the hands of the Afghans, not one act\r\ninfringing the rules of civilized warfare was committed by my troops.\r\nThe persons and property of the Natives were respected, and full\r\ncompensation for supplies was everywhere given. In short, the\r\ninhabitants of the district through which we passed could not have\r\nbeen treated with greater consideration nor with a lighter hand, had\r\nthey proved themselves friendly allies, and the conduct of the troops\r\nwill ever be to me as pleasing a memory as are the results which they\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Brownlow's death was a great loss, for throughout the\r\nwar he had frequently distinguished himself as a leader--at the Peiwar\r\nKotal, during the operations round Kabul, and notably on the 14th\r\nDecember, when he won the admiration of the whole force by his\r\nbrilliant conduct in the attack on the Asmai heights.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The following Native officers, British and Native\r\nnon-commissioned officers, and Native soldiers were brought forward as\r\nhaving been very conspicuous during this part of the fight:\r\n\r\n  Colour-Sergeant G.

Her Majesty also wrote of 'the thrill of horror' with which\r\nthe news of the fate of Lieutenant Maclaine had been received, and\r\nconcluded with words of hope that my own health and that of the\r\ntroops would remain good, and that success might attend us 'till the\r\nblessings of peace are restored.'\r\n\r\nA gracious letter, truly! And to me a deeply appreciated reward for\r\nwhat I had been able to do.\r\n\r\nI landed at Dover on the 17th November. The reception I met with from\r\nmy countrymen was as enthusiastic as it was unexpected and gratifying.\r\nAfter an absence of twelve years there must almost always be more or\r\nless of sadness mingled with the pleasure of the home-coming, and two\r\nvacant places in my family circle--those of my father and sister--cast\r\na deep shadow upon what would otherwise have been a most joyous\r\nreturn, for my mother was alive to welcome me, and I found my children\r\nflourishing and my wife well, notwithstanding all the anxiety she had\r\nundergone.\r\n\r\nI was fêted and feasted to almost an alarming extent, considering that\r\nfor nearly two years I had been restricted to campaigning diet; but it\r\nsurprised me very much to find that the kind people, by whom I was so\r\ngreatly honoured, invariably appeared to think the march from Kabul to\r\nKandahar was a much greater performance than the advance on Kabul the\r\nprevious autumn, while, to my mind, the latter operation was in every\r\nparticular more difficult, more dangerous, and placed upon me as the\r\nCommander infinitely more responsibility. The force with which I\r\nstarted from Kuram to avenge the massacre of our fellow-countrymen was\r\nlittle more than half the strength of that with which I marched to\r\nKandahar. Immediately on crossing the Shutargardan I found myself in\r\nthe midst of a hostile and warlike people, entirely dependent on the\r\ncountry for supplies, heavily handicapped by want of transport, and\r\npractically as completely cut off from communication with India as\r\nI was a year later on the march to Kandahar. The Afghans' fanatical\r\nhatred of Europeans had been augmented by their defeats the year\r\nbefore, and by the occurrences at Kabul, and they looked upon my small\r\ncolumn as a certain prey delivered into their hands by a sympathizing\r\nand all-powerful Allah.\r\n\r\nBefore me was Kabul, with its large and well-equipped arsenal,\r\ndefended by an army better organized and more highly trained than that\r\npossessed by any former Ruler of Afghanistan. On all sides of me were\r\ntribesmen hurrying up to defend the approaches to their capital, and\r\nhad there been on our part the smallest hesitation or delay, we should\r\nhave found ourselves opposed by as formidable a combination as we had\r\nto deal with two months later at Sherpur. Nothing could then have\r\nsaved the force, not one man of which I firmly believe would have ever\r\nreturned to tell the tale in India. Worse than all, I had in my own\r\ncamp a traitor, in the form of the Amir, posing as a friend to the\r\nBritish Government and a refugee seeking our protection, while he was\r\nat heart our bitterest enemy, and was doing everything in his power to\r\nmake my task more difficult and ensure our defeat.\r\n\r\nThe march to Kandahar was certainly much longer, the country was\r\nequally unfriendly, and the feeding of so large a number of men and\r\nanimals was a continual source of anxiety. But I had a force capable\r\nof holding its own against any Afghan army that could possibly be\r\nopposed to it, and good and sufficient transport to admit of its\r\nbeing kept together, with the definite object in view of rescuing our\r\nbesieged countrymen and defeating Ayub Khan; instead of, as at Kabul,\r\nhaving to begin to unravel a difficult political problem after\r\naccomplishing the defeat of the tribesmen and the Afghan army.\r\n\r\nI could only account to myself for the greater amount of interest\r\ndisplayed in the march to Kandahar, and the larger amount of credit\r\ngiven to me for that undertaking, by the glamour of romance thrown\r\naround an army of 10,000 men lost to view, as it were, for nearly a\r\nmonth, about the fate of which uninformed speculation was rife and\r\npessimistic rumours were spread, until the tension became extreme,\r\nand the corresponding relief proportionably great when that army\r\nreappeared to dispose at once of Ayub and his hitherto victorious\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nI did not return to India until the end of 1881, six weeks out of\r\nthese precious months of leave having been spent in a wild-goose chase\r\nto the Cape of Good Hope and back, upon my being nominated by Mr.\r\nGladstone's Government Governor of Natal and Commander of the Forces\r\nin South Africa, on the death of Sir George Colley and the receipt of\r\nthe news of the disaster at Majuba Hill. While I was on my way out\r\nto take up my command, peace was made with the Boers in the most\r\nmarvellously rapid and unexpected manner, A peace, alas! 'without\r\nhonour,' to which may be attributed the recent regrettable state of\r\naffairs in the Transvaal--a state of affairs which was foreseen and\r\npredicted by many at the time. My stay at Cape Town was limited to\r\ntwenty-four hours, the Government being apparently as anxious to get\r\nme away from Africa as they had been to hurry me out there.\r\n\r\nIn August I spent three very enjoyable and instructive weeks as the\r\nguest of His Imperial Majesty the Emperor of Germany, while the\r\nmanoeuvres at Hanover and Schleswig-Holstein were taking place.\r\n\r\nShortly before leaving England for Madras, I was asked by Mr.\r\nChilders, the then Secretary of State for War, whether I would accept\r\nthe appointment of Quartermaster-General at the Horse Guards, in\r\nsuccession to Sir Garnet Wolseley. The offer, in some ways, was\r\nrather a temptation to me, for I had a great wish to take part in the\r\nadministration of our army; and had it been made sooner, before my\r\narrangements for going to Madras had been completed, I think I should\r\nhave accepted it at once; as it was, I begged to be allowed to join my\r\nnew command, and leave the question of the Quartermaster-Generalship\r\nin abeyance until it was about to become vacant. This was agreed to,\r\nand I started for Madras, taking my wife and two little daughters with\r\nme, the boy being left at school in England.\r\n\r\nOn arriving in Madras, on the 27th November, I had the pleasure\r\nto find myself associated as a colleague in Council with Mr.\r\nGrant-Duff,[1] who had recently been appointed Governor of the\r\nPresidency. We spent a few pleasant days with him and Mrs. Grant-Duff\r\nat Government House, before proceeding to deposit our children at\r\nOotacamund, that Queen of Indian Hill-stations, which was to be our\r\nhome for four years. We spent Christmas there, and then went to Burma,\r\nvisiting the Andaman Islands on the way. We had on board our ship some\r\nprisoners destined for that convict settlement, amongst whom cholera\r\nunfortunately broke out a few hours after we left Madras. They were\r\naccommodated just outside my wife's cabin, and their cries and groans\r\nwere most distressing. Very little could be done for them on board,\r\nfor the Native Doctor accompanying us possessed no remedy but castor\r\noil! and as the disease was spreading rapidly, I took upon myself to\r\nhave the party landed at Vizagapatam.\r\n\r\nThe cholera patients were put into tents on the sea-shore, under the\r\ncharge of a medical officer, and every arrangement possible for their\r\ncomfort and relief was made before we proceeded on our journey.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay at Port Blair, the Head-Quarters of the Andaman\r\nAdministration, we were the guests of the hospitable Superintendent,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Protheroe, who had been one of the political\r\nofficers on my staff in Afghanistan. The group of islands forming the\r\nsettlement are extremely beautiful, but it is tropical beauty, and one\r\npays the penalty for the luxuriant vegetation in the climate, which is\r\nvery much like a Turkish bath, hot and damp. While going through the\r\nprisons, I came across some of the sepoys of the 29th Punjab Infantry\r\nwho deserted during the advance on the Peiwar Kotal. I was told that\r\nthey were behaving well, and might in time be allowed some remission\r\nof their sentences.\r\n\r\nA voyage of thirty-six hours brought us to Rangoon, where we had the\r\npleasure of meeting and being entertained by our old friends, Mr.\r\nBernard,[2] the Chief Commissioner of Burma, and his wife.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 Thyetmyo and Tonghu were the two frontier stations of Burma,\r\nand I had been asked to consider the question of the defence of the\r\nproposed railway termini at these places. I accordingly visited them\r\nboth, and as I thought I foresaw that the lines of railway could not\r\nend as then contemplated, I recommended that the absolutely necessary\r\nworks only should be attempted, and that these should be as\r\ninexpensive as possible. Ere many years had passed, the line, as I\r\nanticipated, was completed to Mandalay.\r\n\r\nThe defences of Rangoon had also to be arranged for. An examination\r\nof the approaches, however, satisfied me that no elaborate system of\r\nfortification was necessary, and that Rangoon's best security lay in\r\nher winding, dangerous river; so I gave it as my opinion that, with\r\ntwo small batteries at Monkey Point and King's Point, and a couple of\r\ntorpedo-boats, Rangoon would be reasonably safe against attack.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Burma I received letters from H.R.H. the Duke of\r\nCambridge and Mr. Childers, in which were repeated the offer of the\r\nQuartermaster-Generalship at the Horse Guards. But I had by this\r\ntime begun to like my new work, and had no desire to leave Madras; I\r\ntherefore definitely declined the appointment.\r\n\r\nFrom Burma we returned to Ootacamund, viâ Calcutta, where we spent a\r\nfew days with Lord and Lady Ripon and Sir Donald and Lady Stewart.\r\n\r\nLife at 'Ooty' was very pleasant; such peace and repose I had never\r\nbefore experienced; I thoroughly enjoyed the rest after the turmoil of\r\nthe preceding years, and I quite recovered my health, which had been\r\nsomewhat shattered. Unlike other hill-stations, Ootacamund rests on an\r\nundulating tableland, 7,400 feet above the sea, with plenty of room in\r\nthe neighbourhood for riding, driving, and hunting; and, although\r\nthe scenery is nothing like as grand as in the Himalayas, there are\r\nexquisite views to be had, and it is more restful and homelike. We\r\nmade many warm friends and agreeable acquaintances, who when our time\r\nin Madras came to an end presented my wife with a very beautiful\r\nclock 'as a token of esteem and affection'; we were very sorry to bid\r\nfarewell to our friends and to our Nilgiri home.\r\n\r\nEach cold season I made long tours in order to acquaint myself with\r\nthe needs and capabilities of the men of the Madras Army. I tried hard\r\nto discover in them those fighting qualities which had distinguished\r\ntheir forefathers during the wars of the last and the beginning of\r\nthe present century. But long years of peace, and the security and\r\nprosperity attending it, had evidently had upon them, as they always\r\nseem to have on Asiatics, a softening and deteriorating effect; and I\r\nwas forced to the conclusion that the ancient military spirit had died\r\nin them, as it had died in the ordinary Hindustani of Bengal and the\r\nMahratta of Bombay, and that they could no longer with safety be\r\npitted against warlike races, or employed outside the limits of\r\nsouthern India.\r\n\r\nIt was with extreme reluctance that I formed this opinion with regard\r\nto the successors of the old Coast Army, for which I had always\r\nentertained a great admiration. For the sake of the British officers\r\nbelonging to the Madras Army, too, I was very loath to be convinced of\r\nits inferiority, for many of them were devoted to their regiments, and\r\nwere justly proud of their traditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, there was the army, and it was my business as its\r\nCommander-in-Chief to do all that I possibly could towards rendering\r\nit an efficient part of the war establishment of India.\r\n\r\nMadrassies, as a rule, are more intelligent and better educated than\r\nthe fighting races of northern India, and I therefore thought it could\r\nnot be difficult to teach them the value of musketry, and make them\r\nexcel in it. To this end, I encouraged rifle meetings and endeavoured\r\nto get General Officers to take an interest in musketry inspections,\r\nand to make those inspections instructive and entertaining to the men.\r\nI took to rifle-shooting myself, as did the officers on my personal\r\nstaff,[3] who were all good shots, and our team held its own in many\r\nexciting matches at the different rifle meetings.\r\n\r\nAt that time the importance of musketry training was not so generally\r\nrecognized as it is now, especially by the senior officers, who had\r\nall entered the service in the days of 'Brown Bess.' Some of them had\r\nfailed to note the remarkable alteration which the change from\r\nthe musket to the rifle necessitated in the system of musketry\r\ninstruction, or to study the very different conditions under which\r\nwe could hope to win battles in the present day, compared with those\r\nunder which some of our most celebrated victories had been won. It\r\nrequired time and patience to inspire officers with a belief in the\r\nwonderful shooting power of the Martini-Henry rifle, and it was even\r\nmore difficult to make them realize that the better the weapon, the\r\ngreater the necessity for its being intelligently used.\r\n\r\nI had great faith in the value of Camps of Exercise, and\r\nnotwithstanding the difficulty of obtaining an annual grant to defray\r\ntheir cost, I managed each year, by taking advantage of the movement\r\nof troops in course of relief, to form small camps at the more\r\nimportant stations, and on one occasion was able to collect 9,000\r\nmen together in the neighbourhood of Bangalore, where the\r\nCommanders-in-Chief in India and of Bombay (Sir Donald Stewart and the\r\nHon. Arthur Hardinge) were present--the first and last time that\r\nthe 'three Chiefs' in India met together at a Camp of Exercise. The\r\nSappers and Miners were a brilliant exception to the rest of the\r\nMadras Army, being indeed a most useful, efficient body of men, but\r\nas no increase to that branch was considered necessary, I obtained\r\npermission to convert two Infantry regiments into Pioneers on the\r\nmodel of the Pioneer Corps of the Bengal Army, which had always\r\nproved themselves so useful on service. Promotion amongst the British\r\nofficers was accelerated, recruits were not allowed to marry, or, if\r\nmarried, to have their wives with them, and many other minor changes\r\nwere made which did much towards improving the efficiency of the\r\nNative portion of the Madras Army; and I hope I was able to increase\r\nthe comfort and well-being of the British portion also by relaxing\r\nirksome and useless restrictions, and by impressing upon commanding\r\nofficers the advisability of not punishing young soldiers with the\r\nextreme severity which had hitherto been considered necessary.\r\n\r\nI had been unpleasantly struck by the frequent Courts-Martial on the\r\nyounger soldiers, and by the disproportionate number of these lads to\r\nbe met with in the military prisons. Even when the prisoners happened\r\nto be of some length of service, I usually found that they had\r\nundergone previous imprisonments, and had been severely punished\r\nwithin a short time of their enlistment. I urged that, in the first\r\ntwo or three years of a soldier's service, every allowance should be\r\nmade for youth and inexperience, and that during that time faults\r\nshould, whenever practicable, be dealt with summarily, and not visited\r\nwith the heavier punishment which a Court-Martial sentence necessarily\r\ncarries with it, and I pointed out that this procedure might receive a\r\nwider application, and become a guiding principle in the treatment\r\nof soldiers generally. I suggested that all men in possession of a\r\ngood-conduct badge, or who had had no entry in their company defaulter\r\nsheets for one year, should be granted certain privileges, such as\r\nreceiving the fullest indulgence in the grant of passes, consistent\r\nwith the requirements of health, duty, and discipline, and being\r\nexcused attendance at all roll-calls (including meals), except perhaps\r\nat tattoo. I had often remarked that those corps in which indulgences\r\nwere most freely given contained the largest number of well-behaved\r\nmen, and I had been assured that such indulgences were seldom abused,\r\nand that, while they were greatly appreciated by those who received\r\nthem, they acted as an incentive to less well conducted men to try and\r\nredeem their characters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE THREE COMMANDERS-IN-CHIEF IN INDIA.\r\n                GENERAL SIR FREDERICK SLEIGH ROBERTS.\r\nGENERAL SIR ARTHUR E. HARDINGE.    GENERAL SIR DONALD MARTIN STEWART.]\r\n\r\nThe reports of commanding officers, on the results of these small\r\nameliorations, after a six months' trial, were so favourable that I\r\nwas able to authorize still further concessions as a premium on good\r\nbehaviour.\r\n\r\nThe Madras Presidency abounds in places of interest connected with our\r\nearlier struggles in India, and it was possible to combine pleasure\r\nwith duty in a very delightful manner while travelling about the\r\ncountry. My wife frequently accompanied me in my tours, and enjoyed as\r\nmuch as I did our visits to many famous and beautiful places. Madras\r\nitself recalled the struggles for supremacy between the English and\r\nFrench in the middle of the eighteenth century. Arcot reminded one\r\nthat it was in the brilliant capture and still more brilliant defence\r\nof the fort at that place that Clive's soldierly genius first became\r\nconspicuous. Trichinopoly and Wandewash made one think of Stringer\r\nLawrence's and Eyre Coote's splendid services, and while standing on\r\nthe breach at Seringapatam, one was reminded of Wellington's early\r\nlife in India, and marvelled how heavily-armed men could have ventured\r\nto cross the single plank which alone spanned the deep, broad ditch of\r\nthe inner defences.\r\n\r\nI should like to dwell on the architectural wonders of Tanjore and\r\nthe Caves of Ellora; the magnificent entertainments and Princely\r\nhospitality accorded to us by the Nizam of Hyderabad, the late\r\nMaharajas of Mysore and Travancore, the Maharaja of Vizianagram, the\r\nRaja of Cochin, and many other Rulers of Native States; the delights\r\nof a trip along the west coast by the beautiful 'back-water,' and the\r\nreturn journey through the glorious forests of Cannara and Mysore;\r\nthe pleasure of visiting the lovely 'White Lady'[4] and the wonderful\r\nKaveri falls; but to give my readers any idea of their marvels would\r\nbe to put too great a strain upon their patience, which I fear has\r\nalready been severely taxed.\r\n\r\nThe late Maharaja of Travancore was an unusually enlightened Native.\r\nHe spoke and wrote English fluently; his appearance was distinguished,\r\nand his manners those of a well-bred, courteous English gentleman of\r\nthe old school. His speech on proposing the Queen's health was a model\r\nof fine feeling and fine expression, and yet this man was steeped\r\nin superstition. His Highness sat, slightly retired from the table,\r\nbetween my wife and myself while dinner was going on; he partook of\r\nno food or wine, but his close contact with us (he led my wife in to\r\ndinner and took her out on his arm) necessitated his undergoing a\r\nsevere course of purification at the hands of the Brahmins as soon\r\nas the entertainment was over; he dared not do anything without the\r\nsanction of the priests, and he spent enormous sums in propitiating\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the high civilization, luxury, and refinement to\r\nbe found in these Native States, my visits to them strengthened my\r\nopinion that, however capable and enlightened the Ruler, he could have\r\nno chance of holding his country if deprived of the guiding hand of\r\nthe British Government as embodied in the Resident. It is just that\r\ncontrol, so light in ordinary times as to be hardly perceptible, but\r\nfirm enough when occasion demands, which saves the State from being\r\nrent by factions and internal intrigue, or swallowed up by a more\r\npowerful neighbour, for, owing to the influence of the Brahmins and\r\nthe practical seclusion which caste prejudices entail, involving\r\nignorance of what is taking place immediately outside their own\r\npalaces, the Native Princes of the less warlike peoples would have\r\nno chance amidst the anarchy and confusion that would follow the\r\nwithdrawal of British influence.\r\n\r\nA remark made to me by the late Sir Madhava Rao, ex-Minister of the\r\nBaroda State, which exemplifies my meaning, comes back to me at this\r\nmoment. Sir Madhava was one of the most astute Hindu gentlemen in\r\nIndia, and when discussing with him the excitement produced by the\r\n'Ilbert Bill,' he said: 'Why do you English raise these unnecessary\r\nquestions? It is your doing, not ours. We have heard of the cry,\r\n\"India for the Indians,\" which some of your philanthropists have\r\nraised in England; but you have only to go to the Zoological Gardens\r\nand open the doors of the cages, and you will very soon see what would\r\nbe the result of putting that theory into practice. There would be\r\na terrific fight amongst the animals, which would end in the tiger\r\nwalking proudly over the dead bodies of the rest.' 'Whom,' I inquired,\r\n'do you consider to be the tiger?' 'The Mahomedan from the North,' was\r\nhis reply.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MARQUIS OF DUFFERIN, K.P., G.C.B., G.C.M.G.,\r\nG.M.S.I., G.M.I.E., VICEROY OF INDIA.\r\n\r\n_From, an engraving by the Fine Art Society of a portrait by the late\r\nFrank Holl, R.A._]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Now Sir Mount-Stuart Grant-Duff, G.C.S.I.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Now Sir Charles Bernard, K.C.S.I.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Lieutenant-Colonel G.T.

The Marquis of Ripon had\r\ndeparted, and the Earl of Dufferin reigned in his stead.\r\n\r\nAffairs on our north-west and south-east frontiers were at this time\r\nin a very unsettled state. Indeed, the political outlook altogether\r\nhad assumed rather a gloomy aspect. Our relations with the French had\r\nbecome somewhat strained in consequence of their interference with\r\nUpper Burma and our occupation of Egypt; while Russia's activity in\r\nthe valley of the Oxus necessitated our looking after our interests in\r\nAfghanistan. These considerations rendered it advisable to increase\r\nthe army in India by 11,000 British and 12,000 Native troops, bringing\r\nthe strength of the former up to nearly 70,000, with 414 guns, and\r\nthat of the latter to 128,636.\r\n\r\nRussia's movements could not be regarded with indifference, for, while\r\nwe had retreated from our dominating position at Kandahar, she had\r\napproached considerably nearer to Afghanistan, and in a direction\r\ninfinitely more advantageous than before for a further onward move.\r\nUp to 1881 a Russian army advancing on Afghanistan would have had to\r\nsolve the difficult problem of the formidable Hindu Kush barrier, or\r\nif it took the Herat line it must have faced the deserts of Khiva and\r\nBokhara. But all this was changed by Skobeloff's victories over the\r\nTekke Turkomans, which gave Merv and Sarakhs to Russia, and enabled\r\nher to transfer her base from Orenburg to the Caspian--by far the most\r\nimportant step ever made by Russia in her advance towards India. I\r\nhad some years before pointed out to the Government of India how\r\nimmeasurably Russia would gain, if by the conquest of Merv--a conquest\r\nwhich I then looked upon as certain to be accomplished in the near\r\nfuture--she should be able to make this transfer. My words were\r\nunheeded or ridiculed at the time, and I, like others who thought as\r\nI did, was supposed to be suffering from a disease diagnosed by a\r\ndistinguished politician as 'Mervousness.' But a little later those\r\nwords were verified. Merv had become a Russian possession, and\r\nTurkestan was in direct communication by rail and steamer with St.\r\nPetersburg. And can it be denied that this fact, which would have\r\nenabled the army in the Caucasus to be rapidly transported to the\r\nscene of operations, made it possible for General Komaroff practically\r\nto dictate terms to the Boundary Commission which was sent to define\r\nthe northern limits of Afghanistan, and to forcibly eject an Afghan\r\ngarrison from Panjdeh under the eyes of British officers?\r\n\r\nLord Dufferin took up the reins of the Government of India at a time\r\nwhen things had come to such a pass that a personal conference with\r\nthe Amir was considered necessary to arrange for the defence and\r\ndemarcation of His Highness's frontier, the strengthening of Herat,\r\nthe extension of the Sakkur-Sibi railway to Quetta, and the\r\ndiscussion of the general situation. Abdur Rahman was therefore\r\ninvited to meet the Viceroy at Rawal Pindi, where a large standing\r\ncamp was prepared, and my wife and I were bidden amongst a numerous\r\ncompany, including Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess\r\nof Connaught, the Ruling Punjab Chiefs, and the high officers of\r\nGovernment from various parts of India, to be the guests of His\r\nExcellency and Lady Dufferin on the interesting occasion.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was fixed for the end of March, and as there was scarcely\r\ntime for us to return to Madras and get back again before then, we\r\nproceeded leisurely up country, visiting different places and one or\r\ntwo old friends on the way.\r\n\r\nAt Multan I received a cipher telegram from Sir Donald Stewart\r\ninforming me that it had been decided to mobilize two Army Corps, and\r\nthat I was to have command of the first. This was exciting news, and\r\nwe lost no time in making our way to Rawal Pindi, where we should be\r\nin direct communication with Head-Quarters, and hoped to hear what had\r\ntaken place since we left Calcutta to make it necessary to prepare for\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nI soon found out that this action on the part of the Government was\r\nforced on them by the representatives of Russia on the Boundary\r\nCommission, who were persistent in their attempts to encroach on\r\nAfghan territory, in order that they might be in a position to control\r\nthe approaches to Herat, a Russian occupation of which fortress we\r\ncould not permit.\r\n\r\nAbdur Rahman arrived at Rawal Pindi on the last day of March; he was\r\nabout forty-five years of age, and although he required a stick\r\nto walk with, being a martyr to rheumatism, and very stout, his\r\nappearance was decidedly dignified and imposing. He had a manly,\r\nclever, and rather handsome face, marred only by the cruel expression\r\nof the mouth, and his manner was sufficiently courteous though\r\nsomewhat abrupt.\r\n\r\nSeveral semi-private meetings took place between the Viceroy and\r\nthe Amir, at the first of which His Highness, after expressing his\r\nappreciation of the flattering and cordial reception he had met with,\r\nreminded Lord Dufferin that he had consistently warned the British\r\nGovernment of the approach of the Russians towards Afghanistan and of\r\nthe unsettling effect their advance was producing on the minds of\r\nhis countrymen; and he advocated the necessity for timely action. No\r\nattention, he said, had been paid to his warnings, owing, probably, to\r\nthe strife of parties in England, and to the excessive caution of the\r\nBritish Government.\r\n\r\nLord Dufferin, in reply, pointed out that the Amir had been advised\r\nto strengthen northern Afghanistan, and that the services of Engineer\r\nofficers had been offered to him for the purpose of putting Herat into\r\na satisfactory state of defence. His Excellency declared that England\r\nwas resolved that a Russian advance on Herat should be met by a\r\ndeclaration of war; that preparations were then being made to give\r\neffect to that resolve; and that it was now absolutely necessary for\r\nHis Highness to make up his mind which of his two powerful neighbours\r\nhe would elect to choose as his ally.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIS HIGHNESS ABDUR RAHMAN, AMIR OF AFGHANISTAN.]\r\n\r\nAbdur Rahman thanked the Viceroy for his offer of help, but showed\r\nplainly that he had no intention of availing himself of the services\r\nof our Engineers. He vowed that his own personal wishes were entirely\r\nin favour of a close and practical alliance with the British, but that\r\nhis subjects did not share his feelings towards us. They were 'rude,\r\nuneducated, and suspicious.' He hoped that in time they might become\r\nmore disposed to be friendly, but at present he could not pretend\r\nto rely upon them. He then disclosed the real reason for his ready\r\nresponse to the Viceroy's invitation by saying that he would\r\ngratefully receive the assistance of the British Government in the\r\nshape of money, arms, and munitions of war.\r\n\r\nAt a later visit the conversation turned upon the difficulty of the\r\nposition in which the British members of the Boundary Commission were\r\nplaced, and the impossibility of the Afghan posts being able to hold\r\ntheir own in the face of a Russian advance was explained to the Amir.\r\nA map was produced, on which the country to the north of Herat was\r\ncarefully examined, and Russia's claims were made known to him. Abdur\r\nRahman's ideas of topography were not very accurate, but he displayed\r\nconsiderable intelligence in his questions and perception of the\r\nmeaning of the answers, and eventually expressed his willingness to\r\nleave the question of the delimitation of his northern frontier in the\r\nhands of the British Government.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th April there was a parade of the troops, 17,000 in number,\r\nand that evening the Amir was present at a state banquet, at which,\r\nafter the usual loyal toasts, the Viceroy proposed the Amir's health.\r\nHis Highness, in reply, expressed a fervent hope that the prosperity\r\nof the British Empire might long endure, as with it the welfare of\r\nAfghanistan was bound up. He had watched, he said, the progress of\r\nIndia under British rule, and he hoped that Afghanistan might flourish\r\nin like manner; and he ended with a prayer that the Almighty would\r\npreserve Her Majesty's troops in safety, honour, and efficiency.\r\n\r\nTwo days later the Amir was publicly received in durbar by the\r\nViceroy, on whose right hand he was placed, while the Duke of\r\nConnaught occupied the seat on his left. After a few words had been\r\nexchanged, Abdur Rahman rose, and spoke as follows: 'I am deeply\r\nsensible of the kindness which I have received from His Excellency the\r\nViceroy, and of the favour shown me by Her Majesty the Queen-Empress.\r\nIn return for this kindness and favour, I am ready with my army and\r\npeople to render any services that may be required of me or of the\r\nAfghan nation. As the British Government has declared that it will\r\nassist me in repelling any foreign enemy, so it is right and proper\r\nthat Afghanistan should unite in the firmest manner, and side by side\r\nby the British Government.'\r\n\r\nOn being presented, amongst other gifts, with a sword of honour, he\r\nsaid in a loud and determined voice: 'With this sword I hope to smite\r\nany enemy of the British Government.'\r\n\r\nThat same evening the Viceroy received news of the Russian attack\r\non Panjdeh, and communicated it to the Amir, who heard it with\r\nextraordinary equanimity, not appearing to attach any great importance\r\nto the matter, and attributing the defeat of his troops to the\r\ninferiority of their weapons. He observed that the excuse given by the\r\nRussians, that the Afghans intended to attack them, was a frivolous\r\npretext, and declared all that his men had done was very properly to\r\nmake preparations to defend themselves.\r\n\r\nAbdur Rahman had expressed a desire for a British decoration, so\r\nshortly before his departure from India he was invested, informally,\r\nwith the G.C.S.I. As the train was moving off, he said to the British\r\nofficers assembled on the platform: 'I wish you all farewell, and\r\ncommend you to the care of God. May your Government endure and your\r\nhonour increase. I have been greatly pleased and gratified by the\r\nsight of the British Army. I hope and am certain that the friendship\r\nnow existing between us will last for ever.'\r\n\r\nAbdur Rahman had, indeed, every reason to be satisfied with the result\r\nof his visit, for not only was Lord Ripon's promise that England\r\nwould defend his kingdom against foreign aggression ratified by Lord\r\nDufferin, but the Amir was given, in addition to the large sums of\r\nmoney and the considerable amount of munitions of war already received\r\nby him, ten lakhs of rupees, 20,000 breech-loading rifles, a Heavy\r\nbattery of four guns and two howitzers, a Mountain battery, and a\r\nliberal supply of ammunition for both guns and rifles.\r\n\r\nOn the Amir's departure the great camp was broken up, and the troops\r\nreturned to their respective stations, all prepared to move towards\r\nthe Quetta frontier at a moment's notice. The Native Chiefs, in taking\r\ntheir leave of the Viceroy, were profuse in their offers and promises\r\nof help should a recourse to arms be found necessary; and Lord and\r\nLady Dufferin's numerous guests, who, like my wife and myself, had for\r\nmore than a fortnight been recipients of the most profuse hospitality,\r\nwished their generous host and hostess a hearty good-bye.\r\n\r\nInteresting as the whole proceeding had been, by far the most\r\ngratifying result of the gathering was the unmistakable loyalty\r\ndisplayed by the Native Rulers who were present, as well as by those\r\nin distant parts of India, on hearing of the unprovoked attack made\r\nby the Russians on the Afghan troops at Panjdeh, and our consequent\r\npreparations for war. The greatest enthusiasm prevailed, and the\r\nvarious military camps at Rawal Pindi were crowded with men desirous\r\nof joining the ranks of our army. I was literally besieged by old\r\nsoldiers, begging that they might be allowed to return to the colours\r\nand fight once more for the _Sirkar_; and one Native officer, who\r\nhad been with me in Afghanistan, came to me and said: 'I am afraid,\r\n_sahib_, I am too old and infirm to do more work myself; but you\r\nmust take my two sons with you--they are ready to die for the\r\n_Angrese_.'[1]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF CENTRAL ASIA (THE RUSSIAN FRONTIERS).]\r\n\r\nWe hastened back to Madras, and reached Ootacamund after seven\r\nconsecutive nights in the train, with a thermometer at 104° in the\r\ndaytime, the only pause in our journey being at Poona, where we spent\r\na few hours with our friend General Sir John Ross.\r\n\r\nI left my horses at Lahore, and for some weeks lived in daily\r\nexpectation of being ordered back to the Punjab to take command of the\r\n1st Army Corps. A change of Government, however, took place just\r\nin time to prevent the war. Lord Salisbury's determined attitude\r\nconvinced Russia that no further encroachments on the Afghan frontier\r\nwould be permitted; she ceased the 'game of brag' she had been allowed\r\nto play, and the Boundary Commission were enabled to proceed with the\r\nwork of delimitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A Native corruption of the word 'English.']\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV.\r\n1885-1886\r\n\r\n  The Burma expedition--The Camp of Exercise at Delhi\r\n  --Defence of the North-West Frontier--Quetta and Peshawar\r\n  --Communications _versus_ fortifications--Sir George Chesney\r\n\r\n\r\nWe only remained three months at 'Ooty,' for on the 8th July a\r\ntelegram arrived from Lord Dufferin announcing the Queen's approval of\r\nmy being appointed to succeed Sir Donald Stewart as Commander-in-Chief\r\nin India, and granting me leave to visit England before taking up the\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a fortnight all our preparations for departure had been\r\nmade, and on the 18th August we left Bombay, in the teeth of the\r\nmonsoon.\r\n\r\nOur boy, whose holidays had just commenced, met us at Venice, and we\r\nloitered in Italy and Switzerland on our way home. I spent but six\r\nweeks in England, returning to the East at the end of November, to\r\njoin my new command. I met Lord Dufferin at Agra, and accompanied him\r\nto Gwalior, whither his Excellency went for the purpose of formally\r\nrestoring to the Maharaja Sindhia the much coveted fortress of\r\nGwalior, which had been occupied by us since 1858--an act of sound\r\npolicy, enabling us to withdraw a brigade which could be far more\r\nusefully employed elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAt Gwalior we received the news of the capture of Mandalay, and I sent\r\na telegram to Lieutenant-General Prendergast,[1] to congratulate him\r\non the successful conduct of the Burma Expedition.\r\n\r\nAffairs in Burma had been going from bad to worse from the time King\r\nThebaw came to the throne in 1878. Wholesale murders were of constant\r\noccurrence within the precincts of the palace; dacoity was rife\r\nthroughout the country, and British officers were insulted to such\r\nan extent that the Resident had to be withdrawn. In 1883 a special\r\nMission was sent by the King of Burma to Paris, with a view to making\r\nsuch a treaty with the French Government as would enable him to appeal\r\nto France for assistance, in the event of his being involved in\r\ndifficulties with England. The Mission remained eighteen months in\r\nParis, and succeeded in ratifying what the French called a 'Commercial\r\nConvention,' under the terms of which a French Consul was located at\r\nMandalay, who soon gained sufficient ascendancy over King Thebaw\r\nto enable him to arrange for the construction of a railway between\r\nMandalay and Tonghu, and the establishment of a French bank at\r\nMandalay, by means of which France would speedily have gained full\r\ncontrol over the principal sources of Burmese revenue, and power to\r\nexclude British trade from the valley of the Irrawaddy. In furtherance\r\nof these designs, the King picked a quarrel with a British trading\r\ncompany, threatened to cancel their leases for cutting timber, and\r\ndemanded a fine of ten lakhs of rupees.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Commissioner proposed arbitration, but this was declined,\r\nand the King refusing to modify his action with regard to the trading\r\ncompany, the Viceroy proposed to the Secretary of State for India that\r\nan ultimatum[2] should be sent to King Thebaw.\r\n\r\nIn approving of the ultimatum, Lord Randolph Churchill expressed his\r\nopinion that its despatch should be concurrent with the movement of\r\ntroops and ships to Rangoon, that an answer should be demanded\r\nwithin a specified time, and that if the ultimatum were rejected, an\r\nimmediate advance on Mandalay should be made.\r\n\r\nA force[3] of nearly 10,000 men and 77 guns, under the command of\r\nLieutenant-General Prendergast, was accordingly ordered to be in\r\nreadiness at Thyetmyo by the 14th November, and as the reply of the\r\nBurmese Government was tantamount to a refusal, Prendergast was\r\ninstructed to advance on Mandalay, with the result which it was\r\nmy pleasant duty to congratulate him upon in my capacity of\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Army in India.\r\n\r\nFrom Gwalior I went to Delhi to prepare for a Camp of Exercise on a\r\nmuch larger scale than had ever before been held. Many weak points\r\nin the Commissariat and Transport Department having become only too\r\napparent when the mobilization of the two Army Corps had been imminent\r\nthe previous spring, it was considered necessary to test our readiness\r\nfor war, and orders for the strength and composition of the force to\r\nbe manoeuvred had been issued before Sir Donald Stewart left India.\r\n\r\nThe troops were divided into two Army Corps. The northern assembled at\r\nUmballa, and the southern at Gurgaon, 25 miles from Delhi, the points\r\nof concentration being 150 miles apart.\r\n\r\nAfter a fortnight passed in brigade and divisional movements, the\r\nopposing forces advanced, and on the 7th January they came into\r\ncontact on the historic battlefield of Panipat.[4]\r\n\r\nLord Dufferin, whose interest in the efficiency of the army induced\r\nhim to come all the way from Calcutta to witness the last two days'\r\nmanoeuvres, was present--with the twelve 'foreign officers'[5] from\r\nthe principal armies of Europe and America, who had been invited to\r\nattend the camp--at a march-past of the whole force of 35,000 men on\r\nthe 18th. It was a fine sight, though marred by a heavy thunderstorm\r\nand a perfect deluge of rain, and was really a greater test of what\r\nthe troops could do than if we had had the perfect weather we had\r\nhoped for. The 'foreign officers' were, apparently, somewhat surprised\r\nat the fine physique and efficiency of our Native soldiers, but they\r\nall remarked on the paucity of British officers with the Indian\r\nregiments, which I could not but acknowledge was, as it still is, a\r\nweak point in our military organization.\r\n\r\nWhen the camp was broken up, I accompanied the Viceroy to Burma, where\r\nwe arrived early in February, 1886. Lord Dufferin must, I think, have\r\nbeen pleased at the reception he met with at Rangoon. The people\r\ngenerally tried in every possible way to show their gratitude to the\r\nViceroy, under whose auspices the annexation of Upper Burma had been\r\ncarried out, and each nationality had erected a triumphal arch in its\r\nown particular quarter of the town.\r\n\r\nFrom Rangoon we went to Mandalay, where Lord Dufferin formally\r\nannounced the annexation by England of all that part of Upper Burma\r\nover which King Thebaw had held sway. We then proceeded to Madras,\r\nwhere I parted from the Viceregal party and travelled to Bombay to\r\nmeet my wife. Leaving her at Simla to arrange our house, which had\r\nbeen considerably altered and added to, I proceeded to the North-West\r\nFrontier, for the question of its defence was one which interested\r\nme very deeply, and I hoped that, from the position I now held as a\r\nmember of the Government of India, I should be able to get my ideas on\r\nthis, to India, all-important subject listened to, if not altogether\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\nThe defence of the frontier had been considered under the orders of my\r\npredecessor by a Committee, the members of which had recorded their\r\nseveral opinions as to the means which should be adopted to make\r\nIndia secure. But Sir Donald Stewart relinquished his command before\r\nanything could be done to give effect to the measures they advised.\r\n\r\nThe matter had therefore to be taken up afresh by me, and I carefully\r\nstudied the recommendations of the 'Defence Committee' before visiting\r\nthe frontier to refresh my memory by personal inspection as to the\r\npoints to be defended.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that none of the members, with the exception of Sir\r\nCharles Macgregor and the secretary, Major W.G. Nicholson, at all\r\nappreciated the great change which had taken place in our position\r\nsince the near approach of Russia, and our consequent promise to the\r\nAmir to preserve the integrity of his kingdom, had widened the limit\r\nof our responsibilities from the southern to the northern boundary of\r\nAfghanistan.\r\n\r\nLess than a year before we had been on the point of declaring war with\r\nRussia because of her active interference with 'the authority of a\r\nsovereign--our protected ally--who had committed no offence[6];' and\r\neven now it was not certain that peace could be preserved, by reason\r\nof the outrageous demands made by the Russian members of the Boundary\r\nCommission as to the direction which the line of delimitation between\r\nRussian and Afghan territory should take.\r\n\r\nIt was this widening of our responsibilities which prevented me from\r\nagreeing with the recommendations of the Defence Committee, for the\r\nmajority of the members laid greater stress on the necessity\r\nfor constructing numerous fortifications, than upon lines of\r\ncommunication, which I conceived to be of infinitely greater\r\nimportance, as affording the means of bringing all the strategical\r\npoints on the frontier into direct communication with the railway\r\nsystem of India, and enabling us to mass our troops rapidly, should we\r\nbe called upon to aid Afghanistan in repelling attack from a foreign\r\nPower.\r\n\r\nFortifications, of the nature of entrenched positions, were no\r\ndoubt, to some extent, necessary, not to guard against our immediate\r\nneighbours, for experience had taught us that without outside\r\nassistance they are incapable of a combined movement, but for the\r\nprotection of such depots and storehouses as would have to be\r\nconstructed, and as a support to the army in the field.\r\n\r\nThe line chosen at that time for an advance was by Quetta and\r\nKandahar. In the first instance, therefore, I wended my way to\r\nBaluchistan, where I met and consulted with the Governor-General's\r\nAgent, Sir Robert Sandeman, and the Chief Engineer of the Sind-Pishin\r\nRailway, Brigadier-General Browne.[7]\r\n\r\nWe together inspected the Kwaja-Amran range, through which the\r\nKohjak tunnel now runs, and I decided that the best position for an\r\nentrenched camp was to the rear of that range, in the space between\r\nthe Takatu and Mashalik mountains. This open ground was less than four\r\nmiles broad; nature had made its flanks perfectly secure, and in front\r\nwas a network of ravines capable of being made quite impassable by\r\nsimply flooding them. It was unfortunate that the railway had been\r\nmarked out in front instead of in rear of the Takatu range, and that\r\nits construction was too far advanced before the question of defence\r\ncame to be considered to admit of its being altered, otherwise this\r\nposition would have been a complete protection for the line of rail\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nHaving come to a definite conclusion as to the measures to be taken\r\nfor meeting the offensive and defensive requirements of Quetta and the\r\nBolan Pass, I turned my attention to Peshawar and the Khyber Pass,\r\nwhich were infinitely more difficult to deal with, because of the\r\npolitical considerations involved.\r\n\r\nOver the whole of Baluchistan we had entire control, so that in the\r\nevent of an army moving in that direction we could depend upon the\r\nresources of the country being at our disposal, and the people\r\nremaining, at least, neutral. But on the Peshawar side the\r\ncircumstances were altogether different: the tribes were hostile to a\r\ndegree, and no European's life was safe across the frontier. Except in\r\nthe Khyber itself (where the policy of establishing friendly relations\r\nwith the Afridis, and utilizing them to keep open the pass, had\r\nbeen most successfully practised by the political officer,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Warburton), we could not depend on the tribesmen\r\nremaining passive, much less helping us if we advanced into\r\nAfghanistan. While, should an army attempt to invade India from that\r\ndirection, we should to a certainty have every man of the 200,000\r\nwarlike people who inhabit the mountainous district from Chitral to\r\nBaluchistan combining against us, and pouring into India from every\r\noutlet.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons I recorded a strong opinion in opposition to the\r\nproposals of the Defence Committee, which were in favour of the\r\nconstruction of a large magazine at Peshawar and extensive entrenched\r\nworks at the mouth of the Khyber. I pointed out the extreme danger of\r\na position communication with which could be cut off, and which could\r\nbe more or less easily turned, for it was clear to me that until we\r\nhad succeeded in inducing the border tribes to be on friendly terms\r\nwith us, and to believe that their interests were identical with\r\nours, the Peshawar valley would become untenable should any general\r\ndisturbance take place; and that, instead of entrenchments close to\r\nthe Khyber Pass, we required a position upon which the garrisons\r\nof Peshawar and Nowshera could fall back and await the arrival of\r\nreinforcements.\r\n\r\nFor this position I selected a spot on the right bank of the Kabul\r\nriver, between Khairabad and the Indus; it commanded the passage of\r\nthe latter river, and could easily be strengthened by defensive works\r\noutside the old fort of Attock.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily understood by those of my readers who have any\r\nknowledge of our North-West Frontier, or are interested in the\r\nquestion of the defence of India, that other routes exist between the\r\nBolan and the Khyber Passes which might be made use of either by an\r\narmy invading India, or by a force sent from India to the assistance\r\nof Afghanistan; and by such it will probably be asked, as was the case\r\nwhen my recommendations were being discussed, why I did not advise\r\nthese lines to be similarly guarded. My reply was, and is, that there\r\nare no arsenals or depots near these passes to be protected, as at\r\nQuetta and Rawul Pindi; that we should not be likely to use them for\r\nan army moving into Afghanistan; that, although small parties of the\r\nenemy might come by them, the main body of a force operating towards\r\nIndia is bound to advance by the Khyber, for the reason that it would\r\ndebouch directly on highly cultivated country and good roads leading\r\nto all the great cities of the Punjab; and finally that, even if our\r\nfinances would admit of the construction of such a long line of forts,\r\nit would be impossible for our limited army to supply the garrisons\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nHaving completed my inspection of the frontier, I returned to Simla\r\nand drew up a memorandum declaring the conviction I had arrived at\r\nafter careful deliberation, that the improvement of our communications\r\nwas of far greater importance than the immediate construction of\r\nforts and entrenchments, and that, while I would not spare money in\r\nstrengthening well-defined positions, the strategical value of which\r\nwas unmistakable, I would not trouble about those places the primary\r\nimportance of fortifying which was open to argument, and which might\r\nnever be required to be defended; these, I contended, might be left\r\nalone, except so far as to make a careful study of their localities\r\nand determine how they could best be taken advantage of should\r\noccasion require. My note ended with the following words: 'Meanwhile I\r\nwould push on our communications with all possible speed; we must have\r\nroads, and we must have railways; they cannot be made on short notice,\r\nand every rupee spent upon them now will repay us tenfold hereafter.\r\nNothing will tend to secure the safety of the frontier so much as the\r\npower of rapidly concentrating troops on any threatened point, and\r\nnothing will strengthen our military position more than to open out\r\nthe country and improve our relations with the frontier tribes. There\r\nare no better civilizers than roads and railways; and although some\r\nof those recommended to be made may never be required for military\r\npurposes, they will be of the greatest assistance to the civil power\r\nin the administration of the country.'\r\n\r\nAccompanying this paper was a statement of the defensive works which,\r\nin my opinion, should be taken in hand without delay; also of the\r\npositions which required careful study, and the roads and railways\r\nwhich should be constructed, to make the scheme of defence complete.\r\n\r\nSeven years later, when I gave up my command of the Army in India, I\r\nhad the supreme satisfaction of knowing that I left our North-West\r\nFrontier secure, so far as it was possible to make it so, hampered\r\nas we were by want of money. The necessary fortifications had been\r\ncompleted, schemes for the defence of the various less important\r\npositions had been prepared, and the roads and railways, in my\r\nestimation of such vast importance, had either been finished or were\r\nwell advanced.\r\n\r\nMoreover, our position with regard to the border tribes had gradually\r\ncome to be better understood, and it had been realized that they would\r\nbe a powerful support to whichever side might be able to count upon\r\ntheir aid; the policy of keeping them at arm's length had been\r\nabandoned, and the advantages of reciprocal communication were\r\nbecoming more appreciated by them and by us.\r\n\r\nIt was not to be expected that these results could be achieved without\r\na considerable amount of opposition, owing partly to the majority of\r\nour countrymen (even amongst those who had spent the greater part of\r\ntheir lives in India) failing to recognize the change that had taken\r\nplace in the relative positions of Great Britain and Russia in Asia,\r\nand to their disbelief in the steady advance of Russia towards\r\nAfghanistan being in any way connected with India, or in Russia's wish\r\nor power to threaten our Eastern Empire.[8] The idea was very common,\r\ntoo, amongst people who had not deeply considered the subject, that\r\nall proposals for gaining control over our troublesome neighbours\r\non the border, or for facilitating the massing of troops, meant an\r\naggressive policy, and were made with the idea of annexing more\r\nterritory, instead of for the purpose of securing the safety of India,\r\nand enabling us to fulfil our engagements.\r\n\r\nHappily, the Viceroys who governed India while I was\r\nCommander-in-Chief were not amongst those who held these opinions;\r\nand while they had no expectation of India being invaded in the near\r\nfuture, they realized that we could not unconcernedly look on while a\r\ngreat Power was, step by step, creeping closer to our possessions. It\r\nwas a fortunate circumstance, too, that, for the first five years I\r\nwas at the head of the Army in India, I had as my military\r\ncolleague in Council the late General Sir George Chesney, a man of\r\nunquestionable talent and sound judgment, to whose cordial support,\r\nnot only in frontier affairs, but in all my efforts to promote the\r\nefficiency and welfare of the soldier, I was very greatly indebted.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Now General Sir Harry Prendergast, V.C., K.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The ultimatum informed King Thebaw that the British\r\nGovernment insisted upon an Envoy being received at Mandalay, with\r\nfree access to the King, without having to submit to any humiliating\r\nceremony; that proceedings against the trading company would not be\r\npermitted; that a British Agent, with a suitable guard of honour and\r\nsteamer for his personal protection, must be permanently stationed at\r\nthe Burmese capital; that the Burmese Government must regulate their\r\nexternal relations in accordance with British advice; and that proper\r\nfacilities must be granted for the opening up of British trade with\r\nChina viâ Bhamo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The force consisted of 364 seamen and 69 Marines formed\r\ninto a Naval Brigade, with 49 guns, including 27 machine guns, and\r\n3,029 British and 6,005 Native soldiers, with 28 guns.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Panipat is famous for three great battles fought in its\r\nimmediate neighbourhood: one in 1526, by the Emperor Baber against\r\nSultan Ibrahim, which resulted in the establishment of the Mogul\r\ndynasty; the second in 1556, when the Emperor Akbar beat the Hindu\r\nGeneral of the Afghan usurper, and re-established the Moguls in power;\r\nand the third in 1761, when Ahmed Shah Durani defeated the Mahrattas.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: I was much gratified at receiving subsequently from His\r\nImperial Majesty the Emperor William I. and from the Crown Princess of\r\nPrussia autograph letters of acknowledgment of, and thanks for, the\r\nreception accorded and the attention paid to Majors von Huene and von\r\nHagenau, the two representatives of the German army who attended these\r\nmanoeuvres.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Words used by Mr. Gladstone when asking for a vote of\r\ncredit for £6,500,000 for special preparations in connection with the\r\nAfghan difficulty.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The late Major-General Sir James Browne, K.C.S.I., C.B.,\r\nwho, like Sir Robert Sandeman, died while holding the important and\r\nresponsible position of Governor-General's Agent in Baluchistan.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: A Statesman of high reputation in England was so strong\r\nin his disbelief of the necessity for making any preparations in\r\nIndia, that he publicly stated that if the only barrier between Russia\r\nin Asia and Britain in Asia were a mountain ridge, or a stream, or a\r\nfence, there would be no difficulty in preserving peace between Russia\r\nand the United Kingdom.--Speech delivered by the Right Hon. John\r\nBright, M.P., at Birmingham on the 16th April, 1879.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVI.\r\n1886\r\n\r\n  Nursing for the soldier--Pacification of Burma considered\r\n  --Measures recommended--The Buddhist priesthood\r\n  --The Regimental Institute--The Army Temperance Association\r\n\r\n\r\nMany interesting and important questions had to be dealt with during\r\nthis my first year as a member of the Viceroy's Council, and it was\r\npleasant to me to be able to bring before the Government of India a\r\nscheme which my wife had had very much at heart for many years--for\r\nsupplying skilled nursing to the military hospitals in India. That\r\nour sick soldiers (officers and men) should be entirely dependent for\r\nnursing, even in times of the most dangerous illness, on the tender\r\nmercies of 'the orderly on duty,' who, whether kind-hearted or the\r\nreverse, was necessarily utterly untrained and ignorant of the\r\nrequirements of sickness, was a source of unhappiness to her, and had\r\nbeen felt as a cruel want by many; but whenever she had discussed\r\nthe subject with those who might have helped her, she was told that\r\nproposals for supplying this want had already been made, that the\r\nGovernment could not, nor would they ever be able to, act on such\r\nproposals, on account of the prohibitory expense, so she felt there\r\nwas no use in making any appeal until I might be in a position to\r\nsee that any suggestions made by her would be certain to receive the\r\ncareful consideration of Government. This time had now arrived, and\r\nalmost directly Lady Roberts returned to India in 1886 she drew up a\r\nscheme for supplying lady nurses to the military hospitals throughout\r\nIndia, and set to work to try and get the support of some of the\r\nprincipal Medical officers. To her great joy, her recommendations\r\nwere accepted by Lord Dufferin and his Council, and her note upon the\r\nsubject was sent home to the Secretary of State, strongly backed up\r\nby the Government of India. Lord Cross happily viewed the matter in\r\na favourable light, and consented, not only to a certain number of\r\nnurses being sent out the following year as an experiment, but to the\r\nwhole of the cost of the movement being borne by the State, with the\r\nexception of the provision of 'Homes in the Hills' for the nursing\r\nsisters as health resorts, and to prevent the expense to Government\r\nof their having to be sent home on sick-leave when worn out by their\r\ntrying work in the plains. The Secretary of State, however, declared\r\nthese Homes to be 'an important part' of the nursing scheme, 'and\r\nindispensable to its practical working,' but considered that they\r\nshould be provided by private subscription, a condition my wife\r\nundertook to carry out. She appealed to the Army in India to help her,\r\nand with scarcely an exception every regiment and battery generously\r\nresponded--even the private soldiers subscribed largely in proportion\r\nto their small means--so that by the beginning of the following year\r\nmy wife was able to set about purchasing and building suitable houses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LADY ROBERTS OF KANDAHAR.\r\n_From a photograph by Messrs. Johnson and Hoffmann._]\r\n\r\n'Homes' were established at Murree, Kasauli and Quetta, in Bengal,\r\nand at Wellington[1] in Madras, and by making a further appeal to the\r\nofficers of the army, and with the assistance of kind and liberal\r\nfriends in England and India, and the proceeds of various\r\nentertainments, Lady Roberts was able to supply, in connexion with\r\nthe 'Homes' at Murree and Kasauli, wards for the reception of sick\r\nofficers, with a staff of nurses[2] in attendance, whose salaries,\r\npassages, etc., are all paid out of 'Lady Roberts's Fund.' My wife was\r\ninduced to do this from having known many young officers succumb owing\r\nto want of care and improper food at hotels or clubs on being sent to\r\nthe Hills after a hard fight for life in the plains, if they were not\r\nfortunate enough to have personal friends to look after them. Although\r\nit is anticipating events, I may as well say here that the nursing\r\nexperiment proved a complete success, and now every large military\r\nhospital in India has its staff of nurses, and there are altogether 4\r\nsuperintendents, 9 deputy superintendents, and 39 nursing sisters, in\r\nIndia. There are many more wanted in the smaller stations, where there\r\nis often great loss of life from lack of proper nursing, and surely,\r\nas my wife pointed out in her first appeal, 'when one considers what\r\nan expensive article the British soldier is, costing, as he does, £100\r\nbefore landing in India, it seems certain that on the score of economy\r\nalone, altogether setting aside the humane aspect of the question,\r\nit is well worth the State's while to provide him with the skilled\r\nnursing care' which has up to now saved so many lives.\r\n\r\nThat officers as well as men might benefit by the devotion of the\r\n'nursing sister,' I was able to arrange in all the large hospitals\r\nfor some room, or rooms, used until then for other purposes, to be\r\nappropriated for an officers' ward or wards, and these have proved\r\na great boon to the younger officers whose income does not admit of\r\ntheir obtaining the expensive care of a nurse from one of the large\r\ncivil hospitals in the Presidency towns.\r\n\r\nThe next most interesting question, and also the most pressing, which\r\nhad to be considered by the Viceroy's Council during the summer of\r\n1886, was the pacification of Upper Burma. People in England had\r\nexpressed surprise at this being so long delayed. It is extremely\r\neasy, however, to sit at home and talk of what should be done, but\r\nvery difficult to say how to do it, and more difficult still to carry\r\nit out. To establish law and order in a country nearly as large as\r\nFrance, in which dacoity is looked upon as an honourable profession,\r\nwould be no light task even in Europe: but when the country to be\r\nsettled has a deadly climate for several months in the year, is\r\ncovered to a great extent with jungle, and is without a vestige of\r\na road, the task assumes gigantic proportions. In Upper Burma the\r\ngarrison was only sufficient to keep open communication along the line\r\nof the Irrawaddy, and, to add to the embarrassment of the situation,\r\ndisaffection had spread to Lower Burma, and disturbances had broken\r\nout in the almost unknown district between Upper Burma and Assam.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged to send strong reinforcements to Burma so soon as the\r\nunhealthy season should be over and it would be safe for the troops\r\nto go there, and Lieutenant-General Sir Herbert Macpherson (who had\r\nsucceeded me as Commander-in-Chief in Madras) was directed to proceed\r\nthither.\r\n\r\nIn October my wife and I, with some of my staff, started from Simla on\r\na trip across the Hills, with the object of inspecting the stations of\r\nDhurmsala and Dalhousie before it was cool enough to begin my winter\r\ntour in the plains. We crossed the Jalaurie Pass, between 11,000 and\r\n12,000 feet high, and travelling through the beautiful Kulu valley and\r\nover the Bubbu mountain, we finally arrived at Palampur, the centre\r\nof the tea industry in the Kangra valley. Having been cut off from\r\ntelegraphic communication for some time, we went straight to the\r\ntelegraph-office for news, and found at the moment a message being\r\ndeciphered which brought me the terribly sad information that General\r\nMacpherson had died of fever in Burma. In him the country had lost a\r\ngood soldier, and I a friend and comrade for whom I had a great\r\nregard and admiration. We were discussing his untimely end, and I was\r\nconsidering who should replace him, when a second message arrived.\r\nThis was from Lord Dufferin, telling me that he wished me to transfer\r\nmy Head-Quarters to Burma, and arrange to remain there until 'the neck\r\nof the business was broken.'\r\n\r\nI hurried to Calcutta, embarked in the first mail-steamer, and landed\r\nat Rangoon on the 9th November.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Bernard (the Chief Commissioner) and General White had\r\ndone well under very difficult circumstances; but owing partly to\r\nlarge districts being impassable from months of heavy rain, and partly\r\nto the change in Commanders, unavoidable inaction had been forced upon\r\nour troops, and the dacoits had in consequence made head against us.\r\n\r\nHaving been in constant correspondence with General White, I had been\r\nkept informed of his plans, and, as his responsible Chief, I had\r\napproved of them; I therefore had the somewhat complicated military\r\nsituation at my fingers' ends, and did not need to lose a single day\r\nin arranging for a series of combined movements being carried on all\r\nover the country.\r\n\r\nIt was hoped that the recently arrived reinforcements would be\r\nsufficient for all requirements, but it soon became apparent that\r\nthe difficulties connected with the pacification of Burma had been\r\nunder-rated, and that, in addition to more troops, an efficient\r\ncivil administration would have to be provided, to take the place of\r\nmilitary authority so soon as anything like organized resistance had\r\nbeen crushed; for to deal with ordinary robbers I conceived to be\r\nwork more suited to police than to soldiers. Upwards of thirty years'\r\nexperience had proved that the Burmese could not be relied upon for\r\nthis kind of service; I therefore recommended that a large body\r\nof police should be raised in India without delay, and given a\r\nsemi-military organization, and in the meantime I asked for, and was\r\ngiven, five additional regiments.\r\n\r\nI felt very confident of success, for I had taken great care in the\r\nselection of the brigade commanders and staff officers, and I knew\r\nthe troops could be depended upon in any emergency that was likely to\r\narise. Nevertheless, as the work they would have to perform was of\r\nrather an unusual character, irksome as well as difficult, I thought\r\nit advisable to issue some general instructions for the guidance\r\nof the officers in command of the different columns.[3] These\r\ninstructions were carried out so intelligently, and the troops did\r\nsuch good service, especially a very fine body of Mounted Infantry\r\nraised and organized by Major Symons, of the South Wales Borderers,\r\nthat before I returned to India in February, 1887, I was able to\r\nreport that the country was gradually becoming quiet and the Burmese\r\nreconciled to our rule. Most of the principal dacoit leaders had been\r\nkilled or captured, and villages which had been in their hands for\r\nmonths were being reoccupied by their legitimate inhabitants; caravans\r\nwere coming into Mandalay almost daily from districts on the Chinese\r\nborders; contracts for making roads were readily taken up, and there\r\nwas no difficulty in obtaining labour for the railway then being\r\nconstructed between Lower Burma and Mandalay, the first sod of which\r\nwas turned within a month of my arrival at that place.\r\n\r\nIn achieving these satisfactory results I was materially aided by the\r\nhearty co-operation of Sir Charles Bernard and the civil officers\r\nserving under him; while the entire absence of fanaticism amongst\r\nthe Burmese, and their cheerful, happy natures, facilitated our\r\nintercourse with them. I received, besides, most valuable assistance\r\nfrom the Buddhist _Poonghies_, or monks, with many of whom I made\r\nfriends. From the fact that education, secular and religious, is\r\nimparted by these monks, and that every male, from the King to the\r\nhumblest peasant, was obliged to enter a monastery and wear the\r\nsaffron garb of a monk for a certain period, the priesthood had\r\nenormous influence with the Burmese. There are no hereditary Chiefs or\r\nNobles in Burma, the _Poonghies_ being the advisers of the people and\r\nthe centre round which Native society revolves.\r\n\r\nOur occupation of Upper Burma was necessarily a great blow to the\r\nBuddhist priesthood, for many of the monasteries[4] were kept up\r\nentirely by the King, Queen, and Ministers of State; and, as it was\r\nmost advisable to have the influence of the monks in our favour, I\r\nrecommended that a monthly stipend should be paid to the Archbishop\r\nand two senior Bishops of Mandalay. They showed their gratitude by\r\ndoing all they could to help me, and when I was leaving the country\r\nthe old _Thathanabain_ (Archbishop) accompanied me as far as Rangoon.\r\nWe corresponded till his death, and I still hear occasionally from one\r\nor other of my _Poonghie_ friends.\r\n\r\nI remained only a short time in Calcutta on my return to India, and\r\nthen started off again for the North-West Frontier, in company with\r\nGeneral Chesney, who had previously expressed his general concurrence\r\nin my defence proposals, but was anxious to see the several positions\r\nand judge for himself, from an Engineer's point of view, of their\r\nsuitability to be treated as I suggested. It was a great source of\r\ncontentment to me to find that the sites chosen and the style of\r\nentrenchments I had advocated commended themselves to my expert\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nSimla was more than usually gay during the summer of 1887, in\r\nconsequence of the numerous entertainments given in celebration of Her\r\nMajesty's Jubilee. We had just added a ballroom to 'Snowdon,' and we\r\ninaugurated its opening by a fancy ball on the 21st June, in honour of\r\nthe auspicious anniversary.\r\n\r\nMy name appeared in the Jubilee _Gazette_ as having been given the\r\nGrand Cross of the Indian Empire, but what I valued still more was the\r\nacceptance by the Government of India of my strong recommendation for\r\nthe establishment of a Club or Institute in every British regiment and\r\nbattery in India. In urging that this measure should be favourably\r\nconsidered, I had said that the British Army in India could have no\r\nbetter or more generally beneficial memorial of the Queen's Jubilee\r\nthan the abolition of that relic of barbarism, the canteen, and its\r\nsupersession by an Institute, in which the soldier would have under\r\nthe same roof a reading-room, recreation room, and a decently-managed\r\nrefreshment-room.\r\n\r\nLord Dufferin's Government met my views in the most liberal spirit,\r\nand with the sanction of Lord Cross 'The Regimental Institute' became\r\na recognized establishment, a fact which my colleagues in Council\r\nreferred to as a second Jubilee honour for me!\r\n\r\nAt a time when nearly every soldier could read and write, and when\r\nwe hoped to attract to the army men of a better stamp and more\r\nrespectable antecedents than those of which it was composed in 'the\r\ngood old days,' it appeared to me a humiliating anachronism that the\r\ndegrading system of the canteen should still prevail, and that it was\r\nimpossible for any man to retain his self-respect if he were driven to\r\ntake his glass of beer under the rules by which regimental canteens\r\nwere governed. I believed, too, that the more the status of the rank\r\nand file could be raised, and the greater the efforts made to provide\r\nthem with rational recreation and occupation in their leisure hours,\r\nthe less there would be of drunkenness, and consequently of crime, the\r\nless immorality and the greater the number of efficient soldiers in\r\nthe army. Funds having been granted, a scheme was drawn up for the\r\nerection of buildings and for the management of the Institutes.\r\nCanteens were reduced in size, and such attractions as musical\r\ninstruments were removed to the recreation-rooms; the name 'liquor\r\nbar' was substituted for that of 'canteen,' and, that there should be\r\nno excuse for frequenting the 'liquor bar,' I authorized a moderate\r\nand limited amount of beer to be served, if required, with the men's\r\nsuppers in the refreshment-room--an arrangement which has been\r\nfollowed by the happiest results.\r\n\r\nAt first it was thought that these changes would cause a great falling\r\noff in regimental funds, but experience has proved the reverse. With\r\ngood management, the profits from the coffee-shop and the soda-water\r\nmanufactory far exceed those to be derived from the canteen, and this\r\nwithout permitting anyone outside the regiment to purchase from the\r\ncoffee-shop and without interfering at all with local tradesmen.\r\n\r\nAnother measure which I succeeded in carrying through the same year\r\nwas the amalgamation of the various sectarian societies that existed\r\nin India for the prevention of drunkenness in the army into one\r\nundenominational society, under the name of the Army Temperance\r\nAssociation, which I hoped would admit of more united action and a\r\nmore advantageous use of funds, besides making it easier for the\r\nGovernment to assist the movement. The different religious and 'total\r\nabstinence' associations had no doubt done much towards the object\r\nthey had in view, but their work was necessarily spasmodic, and being\r\ncarried on independently of regimental authority, it was not always\r\nlooked upon with favour by officers.\r\n\r\nThere was of necessity at first a good deal of opposition on the part\r\nof the promoters of the older societies, but those who were loudest in\r\ndenouncing my proposals soon came to understand that there was nothing\r\nin the constitution of the Army Temperance Association which could in\r\nany way interfere with total abstinence, and that the only difference\r\nbetween their systems and mine consisted in mine being regimental in\r\nits character, and including men for whom it was not necessary or\r\nexpedient to forego stimulants altogether, but who earnestly desired\r\nto lead temperate lives, and to be strengthened in their resolve by\r\nbeing allowed to share in the advantages of the new Institution.\r\n\r\nTo make the movement a complete success, it was above all things\r\nimportant to secure the active co-operation of the ministers of the\r\nvarious religions. To this end I addressed the heads of the different\r\nchurches, explaining my reasons and the results I hoped to attain\r\nin establishing the amalgamated association, and I invited them to\r\ntestify their approval of the scheme by becoming patrons of it.\r\nWith two exceptions, the dignitaries to whom I appealed accepted\r\nmy invitation, and expressed sympathy with my aims and efforts,\r\nan encouragement I had hardly dared to hope for, and a proof of\r\nliberal-mindedness on the part of the prelates which was extremely\r\nrefreshing.\r\n\r\nThe Government of India were good enough to sanction the allotment of\r\na separate room in each soldiers' Institute for the exclusive use of\r\nthe Association, where alcohol in any shape was not admitted, and to\r\nthe grant of this room I attribute, in a great measure, the success of\r\nthe undertaking. The success was proved by the fact that, when I left\r\nIndia, nearly one third of the 70,000 British soldiers in that country\r\nwere members or honorary members of the Army Temperance Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The homes at Quetta and Wellington were eventually taken\r\nover by Government, and Lady Roberts' nurses, who worked in the\r\nmilitary hospitals at these stations, were replaced by Government\r\nnurses when the increase to the Army Nursing Service admitted of this\r\nbeing done.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: When the 'Homes in the Hills' are closed during the cold\r\nmonths, these nurses attend sick officers in their own houses in the\r\nplains, free of charge except travelling expenses.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: These instructions are given in the Appendix.

Part of this trip was made in company with the Viceroy\r\nand Lady Dufferin, who visited all the principal stations on the\r\nfrontier, including Quetta. I rode with Lord Dufferin through the\r\nKhyber Pass, and to the top of the Kwaja Amran range, our visit to\r\nthis latter point resulting, as I earnestly hoped it would, in His\r\nExcellency being convinced by personal inspection of the advantage to\r\nbe gained by making the Kohjak tunnel, and of the necessity for our\r\nendeavouring to cultivate more friendly relations with the border\r\ntribes. We ended this very enjoyable tour at Rawal Pindi in order to\r\nbe present at the winding-up of a Cavalry Camp of Exercise in the\r\nneighbourhood. There were assembled together under the direction of\r\nMajor-General Luck one regiment of British and eight regiments of\r\nNative Cavalry, with two batteries of Royal Horse Artillery, and it\r\nwas a pretty sight, their advance at full gallop, and the halt, as\r\nof one man, of that long line of Cavalry within a few yards of the\r\nViceroy, for the Royal salute. The spectators were much impressed with\r\nLord Dufferin's nerve in being able to remain perfectly calm and still\r\non his horse in the face of such an onslaught, and it certainly did\r\nseem rather close quarters; but General Luck knew his regiments, and\r\nhad confidence in his men, and we knew General Luck.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1888 I visited all the chief military stations in\r\nthe Bengal Presidency, and attended Camps of Exercise for all arms,\r\nheld at Rawal Pindi, Umballa, Meerut, and Lucknow, before going to\r\nCalcutta for the usual discussion on the Budget; after which the\r\nGovernment generally breaks up for the hot weather, and assembles in\r\nSimla two or three weeks later.\r\n\r\nDuring 1887 and 1888 much useful work was got through by the Defence\r\nCommittee, and by another Committee which was assembled for the\r\nconsideration of all questions bearing upon the mobilization of the\r\narmy. As Commander-in-Chief I presided over both, and was fortunate\r\nin being able to secure as my secretaries two officers of exceptional\r\nability, Lieutenant-Colonel W. Nicholson, R.E., for defence, and\r\nLieutenant-Colonel E. Elles, R.A., for mobilisation. It was in a great\r\nmeasure due to Colonel Nicholson's clear-sighted judgment on the many\r\nknotty questions which came before us, and to his technical knowledge,\r\nthat the schemes for the defence of the frontier, and for the ports\r\nof Bombay, Karachi, Calcutta, Rangoon and Madras, were carried out so\r\nrapidly, thoroughly and economically as they were;[1] and with regard\r\nto measures for rendering the army mobile, Colonel Elles proved\r\nhimself equally capable and practical. The Secretary to Government\r\nin the Military Department, Major-General Edwin Collen, was a\r\nparticularly helpful member of the Committees[2] from his intimate\r\nacquaintance with the various subjects which had to be discussed.\r\n\r\nIf my readers have had the patience to follow in detail the several\r\ncampaigns in which I took part, they will have grasped the fact that\r\nour greatest difficulties on all occasions arose from the want of a\r\nproperly organized Transport Department, and they will understand\r\nthat I was able to make this very apparent when the necessity\r\nfor mobilizing rapidly only one Army Corps came to be seriously\r\nconsidered. We were able to demonstrate conclusively the impossibility\r\nof putting a force into the field, sufficiently strong to cope with a\r\nEuropean enemy, without a considerable increase to the existing number\r\nof transport animals, and without some description of light cart\r\nstrong enough to stand the rough work of a campaign in a country\r\nwithout roads; for it is no exaggeration to say that in the autumn of\r\n1880, when I left Kandahar, it would have been possible to have picked\r\nout the road thence to Quetta, and onward to Sibi, a distance of 250\r\nmiles, with no other guide than that of the line of dead animals and\r\nbroken-down carts left behind by the several columns and convoys that\r\nhad marched into Afghanistan by that route.\r\n\r\nSoon after I took over the command of the Army in India, while\r\nvoyaging to Burma, I had brought this most pressing question of\r\ntransport to the notice of Lord Dufferin, who, with his usual quick\r\nappreciation of a situation, at once fully recognized its urgency, and\r\npromised to give me all possible help in my endeavour to render the\r\narmy mobile--a promise which he amply fulfilled by taking a keen\r\npersonal interest in the proceedings of the Committee, and giving his\r\nhearty support to our various recommendations.[3]\r\n\r\nOur labours resulted in several thousand good pack animals (chiefly\r\nmules) being purchased, and information collected and recorded as\r\nto the districts where others could be rapidly procured in case of\r\nemergency. A transport service was established, for which officers had\r\nto go through a regular course of instruction, and pass an examination\r\nin the loading and general management of the animals. A prize was\r\noffered for a strong, useful light cart; and when the most suitable\r\nhad been selected, large numbers were made up of the same pattern.[4]\r\nThe constitution of two Army Corps, to be in readiness for taking the\r\nfield on short notice, was decided upon, and the units to form the\r\nseveral divisions and brigades were told off and provided with the\r\nnecessary equipment. A railway time-table was prepared, giving the\r\nhours at which the troops should leave their stations so as to avoid\r\nany block _en route_. Special platforms were constructed for training\r\nand detraining Cavalry and Artillery, and storehouses were erected and\r\nstocked at those stations where road marching would probably commence.\r\nFinally the conclusions we had arrived at were embodied in a manual\r\nentitled 'General Regulations for Mobilization.' It was extremely\r\ngratifying to me to learn from India that this manual, with such\r\nadditions and alterations as our subsequent experience in Burma and\r\nvarious frontier expeditions proved would be advantageous, was\r\nthe guide by which the Chitral relieving force was last year so\r\nexpeditiously and completely equipped and despatched.\r\n\r\nOf the many subjects discussed and measures adopted during this the\r\nlast year of Lord Dufferin's Viceroyalty, I think the scheme for\r\nutilizing the armies of Native States, as an auxiliary force for the\r\nservice of the Empire, was the most important both from a political\r\nand military point of view.\r\n\r\nThe idea was, in the first instance, propounded by Lord Lytton, who\r\nappointed a committee to consider the pros and cons of the question.\r\nI was a member of that committee, but at that time I, in common with\r\nmany others, was doubtful as to the wisdom of encouraging a high state\r\nof efficiency amongst the troops of independent States; the excellent\r\nwork, however, done by the Native Contingent I had with me in Kuram,\r\nand the genuine desire of all ranks to be allowed to serve side by\r\nside with our own soldiers, together with the unmistakable spirit of\r\nloyalty displayed by Native Rulers when war with Russia was imminent\r\nin 1885, convinced me that the time had arrived for us to prove to\r\nthe people of India that we had faith in their loyalty, and in their\r\nrecognition of the fact that their concern in the defence of the\r\nEmpire was at least as great as ours, and that we looked to them to\r\ntake their part in strengthening our rule and in keeping out all\r\nintruders. I believed, too, that we had now little to fear from\r\ninternal trouble so long as our Government continued just and\r\nsympathetic, but that, on the other hand, we could not expect to\r\nremain free from outside interference, and that it would be wise to\r\nprepare ourselves for a struggle which, as my readers must be aware, I\r\nconsider to be inevitable in the end. We have done much, and may\r\nstill do more, to delay it, but when that struggle comes it will be\r\nincumbent upon us, both for political and military reasons, to make\r\nuse of all the troops and war material that the Native States can\r\nplace at our disposal, and it is therefore to our advantage to render\r\nboth as efficient and useful as possible.\r\n\r\nThe subject was, of course, most delicate and complex, and had to\r\nbe treated with the greatest caution, for not only was the measure\r\nadapted to materially strengthen our military position in India, but\r\nI was convinced it was politically sound, and likely to be generally\r\nacceptable to the Native Rulers, provided we studied their wishes, and\r\nwere careful not to offend their prejudices and susceptibilities by\r\nunnecessary interference.\r\n\r\nIt was very satisfactory to find how cordially the Chiefs responded\r\nto Lord Dufferin's proposals, and extremely interesting to watch the\r\nsteady improvement in their armies under the guidance of carefully\r\nselected British officers. Substantial results have been already\r\nobtained, valuable help having been afforded to the Chitral expedition\r\nby the transport trains organized by the Maharajas of Gwalior and\r\nJaipur, and by the gallantry of the Imperial Service Troops belonging\r\nto His Highness the Maharaja of Kashmir at Hunza-Naga and during the\r\nsiege and relief of Chitral.\r\n\r\nTwo minor expeditions took place this year: one against the Thibetans\r\nin retaliation for their having invaded the territory of our ally, the\r\nRaja of Sikim; the other to punish the Black Mountain tribes for the\r\nmurder of two British officers. Both were a success from a military\r\npoint of view, but in the Black Mountain the determination of the\r\nPunjab Government to limit the sphere of action of the troops, and\r\nto hurry out of the country, prevented our reaping any political\r\nadvantage. We lost a grand opportunity for gaining control over this\r\nlawless and troublesome district; no survey was made, no roads opened\r\nout, the tribesmen were not made to feel our power, and, consequently,\r\nvery soon another costly expedition had to be undertaken.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1888, Lord Dufferin left India amidst a storm of regret\r\nfrom all classes of Her Majesty's subjects. He was succeeded by Lord\r\nLansdowne, one of whose earliest communications to me rejoiced my\r\nheart, for in it His Excellency inquired whether anything could be\r\ndone towards improving our relations with the frontier tribes. This\r\naugured well for the abandonment of the traditional, selfish, and,\r\nto my mind, short-sighted policy of keeping aloof, and I hoped that\r\nendeavours would at last be made to turn the tribesmen into friendly\r\nneighbours, to their advantage and ours, instead of being obliged\r\nto have recourse to useless blockades or constant and expensive\r\nexpeditions for their punishment, or else to induce them to refrain\r\nfrom troubling us by the payment of a heavy blackmail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MARQUESS OF LANSDOWNE, K.G., G.C.M.G., G.M.S.I.,\r\nG.M.I.E.. VICEROY OF INDIA.\r\n_From a photograph by Cowell, Simla_.]\r\n\r\nAfter a visit to the frontier in the autumn to see how the defences\r\nwere advancing, I attended a Cavalry Camp of Exercise at Delhi, and\r\nan Artillery Practice Camp at Gurgaon, and then went to Meerut to\r\nbe present at the first meeting of the Bengal Presidency Rifle\r\nAssociation, which was most interesting and successful. We spent\r\nChristmas in camp--the first Christmas we had all been together for\r\nten years. Our boy, having left Eton, came out in the early part\r\nof the year with a tutor, to be with us for eighteen months before\r\nentering Sandhurst.\r\n\r\nAt the end of December I proceeded to Calcutta rather earlier than\r\nusual, to pay my respects to the new Viceroy, and in January of the\r\nfollowing year, accompanied by my wife and daughter, I started off\r\non a long tour to inspect the local regiments in Central India and\r\nRajputana, and to ascertain what progress had been made in organizing\r\nthe Imperial Service Troops in that part of India.\r\n\r\nDid space permit, I should like to tell my readers of the beauties of\r\nUdaipur and the magnificent hospitality accorded to us there, as well\r\nas at Bhopal, Jodhpur, Jaipur, and Ulwar, but, if I once began,\r\nit would be difficult to stop, and I feel I have already made an\r\nunconscionably heavy demand on the interest of the public in things\r\nIndian, and must soon cease my 'labour of love.' I must therefore\r\nconfine myself to those subjects which I am desirous should be better\r\nunderstood in England than they generally are.\r\n\r\nUpon seeing the troops of the Begum of Bhopal and the Maharana of\r\nUdaipur, I recommended that Their Highnesses should be invited to\r\nallow their share of Imperial defence to take the form of paying for\r\nthe services of an increased number of officers with their respective\r\nlocal corps,[5] for I did not think it would be possible to make any\r\nuseful addition to our strength out of the material of which their\r\nsmall armies were composed. The men were relics of a past age, fit\r\nonly for police purposes, and it would have been a waste of time and\r\nmoney to give them any special training. My recommendation, however,\r\nwas not accepted, and neither of these States takes any part in the\r\ndefence scheme.\r\n\r\nAt Jodhpur, on the contrary, there was splendid material, and a\r\nmost useful force was being organized by the Maharaja's brother,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Sir Pertap Sing, himself a Rajput, and of the\r\nbluest blood of India. The Cavalry were specially fine. The gallant\r\nRajput horsemen of Jodhpur had always been famous for their chivalrous\r\nbravery, unswerving fidelity, and fearless self-devotion in their wars\r\nwith the Mahrattas and the armies of the Mogul Emperors, and I felt,\r\nas the superbly mounted squadrons passed before me, that they had lost\r\nnone of their characteristics, and that blood and breeding must tell,\r\nand would, if put to the test, achieve the same results now as of\r\nold. There could be but one opinion as to the value of the 'Sirdar\r\nRissala,'[6] so named after the Maharaja's son and heir, Sirdar\r\nSing, a lad of only nine years old, who led the little army past the\r\nsaluting flag mounted on a beautiful thorough-bred Arab.\r\n\r\nThe Jaipur troops were much on a par with those of Bhopal and Udaipur.\r\nI was glad, therefore, that in lieu of troops, the Maharaja had agreed\r\nto organize, as his contribution to the Imperial service, a transport\r\ncorps of 1,000 fully-equipped animals.\r\n\r\nAt Ulwar I found the 600 Cavalry and 1,000 Infantry (all Rajputs) well\r\nadvanced in their drill and training; this was evidently owing to the\r\npersonal interest taken in them by the Maharaja, who seldom allowed a\r\nday to pass without visiting the parade grounds.\r\n\r\nBy the end of March I had finished my tour in Central India and\r\nRajputana, and as the heat was every day becoming more intense, I was\r\nnot sorry to turn my steps northwards towards Kashmir, the army of\r\nwhich State still remained to be inspected, and the measures most\r\nsuitable for its re-organization determined upon.\r\n\r\nOur whole family party re-assembled at Murree early in April, and we\r\nall went into the 'Happy Valley' together, where between business and\r\npleasure we spent a most delightful six weeks. The Maharaja personally\r\nsuperintended the arrangements for our comfort. Our travelling was\r\nmade easy--indeed luxurious--and everything that the greatest care and\r\nforethought and the most lavish hospitality could accomplish to make\r\nour visit happy was done by the Maharaja and by the popular Resident,\r\nColonel Nisbet.\r\n\r\nThe Kashmir army was much larger than any of those belonging to the\r\nNative States I had lately visited; it consisted of 18,000 men and 66\r\nguns--more than was needed, even with the Gilgit frontier to guard.\r\nSome of the regiments were composed of excellent material, chiefly\r\nDogras; but as the cost of such a force was a heavy drain upon the\r\nState, and as many of the men were old and decrepit, I recommended\r\nthat the Maharaja should be invited to get rid of all who were\r\nphysically unfit, and to reduce his army to a total of 10,000\r\nthoroughly reliable men and 30 guns. I knew this would be a very\r\ndifficult, and perhaps distasteful, task for the Commander-in-Chief\r\n(who was also the Maharaja's brother), Raja Ram Sing, to perform, so\r\nI recommended that a British officer should be appointed military\r\nadviser to the Kashmir Government, under whose supervision the work of\r\nreformation should be carried out.\r\n\r\nAt that time we had none of our own troops in the neighbourhood of\r\nGilgit, and as I thought it advisable, in case of disturbance, that\r\nthe Kashmir troops should be speedily put into such a state of\r\nefficiency as would enable us to depend upon them to hold the passes\r\nuntil help could arrive from India, I urged that the military adviser\r\nshould be given three British officers to assist him in carrying out\r\nhis difficult and troublesome duty; and at the same time I pointed\r\nout that it was absolutely essential to construct at an early date a\r\nserviceable road between Kashmir and Gilgit, as the sole approach to\r\nthat strategic position was not only difficult, but very dangerous.\r\n\r\nAll these proposals commended themselves to, and were acted upon by,\r\nthe Viceroy.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Neville Chamberlain--a _persona grata_ to the\r\nKashmir authorities--was appointed Military Secretary to the Kashmir\r\nState, and by his ability, tact, and happy way of dealing with\r\nNatives, quickly overcame all obstacles. The Maharaja and his two\r\nbrothers, Rajas Ram Sing and Amar Sing, entered heartily into the\r\nscheme; the army was remodelled and rendered fit for service; and an\r\nexcellent road was made to Gilgit.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1889 I was able to introduce several much needed\r\nreforms in the annual course of musketry for the Native Army.\r\nThe necessity for these reforms had not been overlooked by my\r\ndistinguished predecessors, nor by the able officers who served under\r\nthem in the Musketry Department, but it had not been possible to do\r\nmuch with a system which dated from a period when fire discipline was\r\nnot thought of, and when the whole object of the course was to make\r\nsoldiers individually good shots. After the Delhi Camp of Exercise\r\nin 1885-86, when the want of fire control was almost the only point\r\nunfavourably criticized by the foreign officers, the Army in India\r\nmade a great advance in this important branch of musketry training;\r\nnevertheless, I felt that further progress was possible, and that the\r\ncourse of instruction was not altogether as practical as it might be.\r\nI therefore gave over the work of improvement in this respect to\r\nan enthusiast in the matter of rifle-shooting and an officer of\r\nexceptional energy and intelligence, Lieutenant-Colonel Ian Hamilton,\r\nand directed him, as Assistant Adjutant-General of Musketry, to\r\narrange a course of instruction, in which the conditions should\r\nresemble as nearly as possible those of field service, and in which\r\nfire discipline should be developed to the utmost extent. He was most\r\nsuccessful in carrying out my wishes, and the results from the first\r\nyear's trial of the new system were infinitely better than even I had\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the improvement in musketry, a great advance was\r\nmade in gunnery. Artillery, like Infantry officers, had failed to\r\nrealize the value of the new weapon, and it required the teaching of\r\na man who himself thoroughly believed in and understood the\r\nbreech-loading gun to arouse Artillerymen to a sense of the tremendous\r\npower placed in their hands, and to the importance of devoting much\r\nmore care and attention to practice than had hitherto been thought\r\nnecessary. Such a man was Major-General Nairne, and I was happily\r\nable to induce the Government to revive in him the appointment of\r\nInspector-General of Artillery.\r\n\r\nUnder the unwearying supervision of this officer, there was quite as\r\nremarkable an improvement in Artillery shooting as Colonel Hamilton\r\nhad effected in musketry. Practice camps were annually formed at\r\nconvenient localities, and all ranks began to take as much pride in\r\nbelonging to the 'best shooting battery' as they had hitherto taken\r\nin belonging to the 'smartest,' the 'best-horsed,' or the\r\n'best-turned-out' battery. I impressed upon officers and men that the\r\ntwo things were quite compatible; that, according to my experience,\r\nthe smartest and best turned-out men made the best soldiers; and while\r\nI urged every detail being most carefully attended to which could\r\nenable them to become proficient gunners and take their proper place\r\non a field of battle, I expressed my earnest hope that the Royal\r\nArtillery would always maintain its hitherto high reputation for\r\nturn-out and smartness. The improvement in the Cavalry was equally\r\napparent. For this arm of the service also the Government consented to\r\nan Inspector-General being appointed, and I was fortunate enough to\r\nbe able to secure for the post the services of Major-General Luck, an\r\nofficer as eminently fitted for this position as was General Nairne\r\nfor his.\r\n\r\nJust at first the British officers belonging to Native Cavalry were\r\napprehensive that their sowars would be turned into dragoons, but\r\nthey soon found that there was no intention of changing any of their\r\ntraditional characteristics, and that the only object of giving them\r\nan Inspector-General was to make them even better in their own way\r\nthan they had been before, the finest Irregular Cavalry in the world,\r\nas I have not the slightest doubt they will always prove themselves to\r\nbe. Towards the end of the Simla season of 1889, Lord Lansdowne, to my\r\ngreat satisfaction, announced his intention of visiting the frontier,\r\nand asked me to accompany him.\r\n\r\nWe rode through the Khyber and Gomal Passes, visited Peshawar, Kohat,\r\nBannu, Dera Ismail Khan, and Quetta, looked into the Kohjak tunnel,\r\nand attended some interesting manoeuvres, carried out with a view of\r\ntesting, in as practical a manner as possible, the defensive power\r\nof the recently-finished Takatu-Mashalik entrenchment. The principal\r\nworks were fired upon by Artillery and Infantry, and, notwithstanding\r\nthe excellent practice made, infinitesimal damage was done, which\r\nproved the suitability of the particular design adopted for the\r\ndefences.\r\n\r\nLord Lansdowne expressed himself greatly interested, and much\r\nimpressed by all he saw of the frontier; and he was confirmed in his\r\nopinion as to the desirability of establishing British influence\r\namongst the border tribes. With this object in view, His Excellency\r\nauthorized Sir Robert Sandeman (the Governor-General's Agent at\r\nQuetta) to establish a series of police posts in the Gomal Pass, and\r\nencourage intercourse between the people of the Zhob district and\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nIt was high time that something should be done in this direction,\r\nfor the Amir's attitude towards us was becoming day by day more\r\nunaccountably antagonistic. He was gradually encroaching on territory\r\nand occupying places altogether outside the limits of Afghan control;\r\nand every movement of ours--made quite as much in His Highness's\r\ninterest as in our own--for strengthening the frontier and improving\r\nthe communications, evidently aroused in him distrust and suspicion as\r\nto our motives.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The total coat of the coast and frontier defences\r\namounted to the very moderate sum of five crores of rupees, or about\r\nthree and a half millions sterling.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The Committees consisted, besides the Military Member of\r\nCouncil and myself, of the heads of Departments with the Government of\r\nIndia and at Army Head-Quarters.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: When the report of the Mobilization Committee was\r\nsubmitted to the Viceroy, he recorded a minute expressing his\r\n'warm admiration of the manner in which the arduous duty had been\r\nconducted,' and 'his belief that no scheme of a similar description\r\nhad ever been worked out with greater thoroughness, in more detail,\r\nand with clearer apprehension of the ends to be accomplished.' He\r\nconcluded by conveying to the members an expression of his great\r\nsatisfaction at what had been done, and recording that 'the result\r\nof the Committee's labours is a magnificent monument of industry and\r\nprofessional ability.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Statement of transport carriage maintained in India in\r\nthe years 1878 and 1893 for military purposes, exclusive of animals\r\nregistered by the civil authorities on the latter date, and liable to\r\nbe requisitioned in time of war:\r\n\r\n  --------------------------------------------\r\n  |          |                 |             |\r\n  |Date      | September, 1878 | April, 1893 |\r\n  |          |                 |             |\r\n  |----------+-----------------+-------------|\r\n  |Elephants.|      733        |      359    |\r\n  |----------+-----------------+-------------|\r\n  |Camels.   |    6,353        |    3,175    |\r\n  |----------+-----------------+-------------|\r\n  |Mules.    |    1,536        |   16,825    |\r\n  |----------+-----------------+-------------|\r\n  |Ponies.   |     ...         |      782    |\r\n  |----------+-----------------+-------------|\r\n  |Bullocks. |    1,424        |    7,211    |\r\n  |----------+-----------------+-------------|\r\n  |Donkeys.  |     ...         |       31    |\r\n  |----------+-----------------+-------------|\r\n  |Army      |                 |             |\r\n  |Transport |     ...         |    5,316    |\r\n  |Carts.    |                 |             |\r\n  |----------+-----------------+-------------|\r\n  |Field     |                 |             |\r\n  |Ambulance |     ...         |      799    |\r\n  |Carts.    |                 |             |\r\n  |-------------------------------------------]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: According to treaty, the Bhopal State pays nearly two\r\nlakhs of rupees a year towards the cost of the local battalion\r\nmaintained by the British Government for the purpose of keeping order\r\nwithin the State itself.

On my way thither I\r\nreceived a letter from Mr. Edward Stanhope, Secretary of State for\r\nWar, telling me that he had heard from Lord Cross, the Secretary of\r\nState for India, that there was a proposal to ask me to retain my\r\nappointment of Commander-in-Chief in India for some time after the\r\nexpiration of the usual term of office; but that, while such an\r\narrangement would have his hearty approval, he thought the question\r\nshould be considered from another point of view, and that it would be\r\nextremely agreeable to himself, and he felt to the Duke of Cambridge\r\nalso, if he could secure me for the post of Adjutant-General in\r\nsuccession to Lord Wolseley. Mr. Stanhope went on to say he would\r\nlike to know whether I would be willing to accept the appointment, or\r\nwhatever position Lord Wolseley's successor would fill, should the\r\nreport of Lord Hartington's Commission cause a change to be made in\r\nthe staff at the Horse Guards.\r\n\r\nI was pleased, though somewhat surprised, at this communication, and I\r\nreplied to the Right Honourable gentleman that I would gladly accept\r\nthe offer, and that I could arrange to join on the 1st October, when\r\nthe appointment would become vacant, but that, as Lord Lansdowne had\r\nexpressed a wish that I should remain in India over the next cold\r\nseason, I hoped, if it were possible, some arrangement might be made\r\nto admit of my doing so. The idea of employment in England, now that I\r\nallowed myself to dwell upon it, was very attractive, for dearly as\r\nI loved my Indian command, and bitterly as I knew I should grieve at\r\nleaving the country, the peoples, and the grand army, which were all\r\nsources of such intense interest to me, I felt that the evil day at\r\nlongest could only be postponed for a few years, and that there is a\r\nlimit to the time that even the strongest European can with impunity\r\nlive in an eastern climate, while I was glad to think I should still\r\nbe in a position to work for my country and for the benefit of the\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nFrom Calcutta I travelled north to Muridki, where a large force of\r\nHorse Artillery and Cavalry was assembled for practice, and where we\r\nhad a standing camp, at which Prince Albert Victor did us the honour\r\nof being our guest for the final manoeuvres. I think His Royal\r\nHighness enjoyed the novelty of camp life, and was greatly attracted\r\nby the picturesque and soldier-like appearance of the Native troops.\r\nThe Native officers were very proud at being presented to the grandson\r\nof their Empress, and at His Royal Highness being appointed Honorary\r\nColonel of the 1st Punjab Cavalry.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of April I returned to Simla for what I thought was to\r\nbe our last season in that place; and shortly after I got up there, a\r\ntelegram from Mr. Stanhope informed me that my appointment had been\r\naccepted by the Cabinet, and that my presence in England was strongly\r\ndesired in the autumn. It was therefore with very great surprise that\r\nI received a second telegram three weeks later from the Secretary\r\nof State, telling me that, as it was then found to be impossible to\r\nchoose my successor, and as the exigencies of the public service\r\nurgently required my presence in India, the Cabinet, with the approval\r\nof Her Majesty and the concurrence of the Duke of Cambridge, had\r\ndecided to ask me to retain my command for two more years.\r\n\r\nI felt it my duty to obey the wishes of the Queen, Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment, and the Commander-in-Chief; but I fully realized that in\r\ndoing so I was forfeiting my chance of employment in England, and that\r\na long and irksome term of enforced idleness would in all probability\r\nfollow on my return home, and I did not attempt to conceal from Mr.\r\nStanhope that I was disappointed.\r\n\r\nAt the latter end of this year, and in the early part of 1891, it was\r\nfound necessary to undertake three small expeditions: one to Zhob,\r\nunder the leadership of Sir George White, for the protection of our\r\nnewly-acquired subjects in that valley; one on the Kohat border,\r\ncommanded by Sir William Lockhart, to punish the people of the\r\nMiranzai valley for repeated acts of hostility; and the third, under\r\nMajor-General Elles,[1] against the Black Mountain tribes, who, quite\r\nunsubdued by the fruitless expedition of 1888, had given trouble\r\nalmost immediately afterwards. All these were as completely successful\r\nin their political results as in their military conduct. The columns\r\nwere not withdrawn until the tribesmen had become convinced that they\r\nwere powerless to sustain a hostile attitude towards us, and that it\r\nwas their interest, as it was our wish, that they should henceforth be\r\non amicable terms with us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIELD-MARSHAL LORD ROBERTS ON HIS ARAB CHARGER\r\n'VONOLEL.'\r\n_From an oil-painting by Charles Furse._]\r\n\r\nWhile a considerable number of troops were thus employed, a fourth\r\nexpedition had to be hurriedly equipped and despatched in quite the\r\nopposite direction to punish the Raja of Manipur, a petty State on\r\nthe confines of Assam, for the treacherous murder of Mr. Quinton, the\r\nChief Commissioner of Assam, and four other British officers.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding its inaccessibility, two columns, one from Burma, the\r\nother from Cachar, quickly and simultaneously reached Manipur, our\r\ncountrymen were avenged, and the administration of the State was taken\r\nover for a time by the Government of India.[2]\r\n\r\nTowards the end of January the Cesarewitch came to Calcutta, where\r\nI had the honour of being introduced to our august visitor, who\r\nexpressed himself as pleased with what he had seen of the country and\r\nthe arrangements made for His Imperial Highness's somewhat hurried\r\njourney through India.\r\n\r\nIn April my military colleague in the Viceroy's Council for five\r\nyears, and my personal friend, General Sir George Chesney, left India,\r\nto my great regret. We had worked together most harmoniously, and, as\r\nhe wrote in his farewell letter, there was scarcely a point in regard\r\nto the Army in India about which he and I did not agree.\r\n\r\nSir George was succeeded by Lieutenant-General Brackenbury, who had\r\nbeen Director of Military Intelligence at the War Office. I was\r\nrelieved to find that, although in some particulars my new coadjutor's\r\nviews differed from mine, we were in accord upon all essential points,\r\nparticularly as to the value of the Indian Army and the necessity for\r\nits being maintained in a state of preparedness for war.\r\n\r\nFrom the time I became Commander-in-Chief in Madras until I left India\r\nthe question of how to render the army in that country as perfect a\r\nfighting machine as it was possible to make it, was the one which\r\ncaused me the most anxious thought, and to its solution my most\r\nearnest efforts had been at all times directed.\r\n\r\nThe first step to be taken towards this end was, it seemed to me, to\r\nsubstitute men of the more warlike and hardy races for the Hindustani\r\nsepoys of Bengal, the Tamils and Telagus of Madras, and the so-called\r\nMahrattas of Bombay; but I found it difficult to get my views\r\naccepted, because of the theory which prevailed that it was\r\nnecessary to maintain an equilibrium between the armies of the three\r\nPresidencies, and because of the ignorance that was only too universal\r\nwith respect to the characteristics of the different races, which\r\nencouraged the erroneous belief that one Native was as good as another\r\nfor purposes of war.\r\n\r\nIn former days, when the Native Army in India was so much stronger in\r\npoint of numbers than the British Army, and there existed no means\r\nof rapid communication, it was only prudent to guard against a\r\npredominance of soldiers of any one creed or nationality; but with\r\nBritish troops nearly doubled and the Native Army reduced by more than\r\none-third, with all the forts and arsenals protected, and nearly the\r\nwhole of the Artillery manned by British soldiers, with railway and\r\ntelegraph communication from one end of India to the other, with the\r\nrisk of internal trouble greatly diminished, and the possibility of\r\nexternal complications becoming daily more apparent, circumstances and\r\nour requirements were completely altered, and it had become essential\r\nto have in the ranks of our Native Army men who might confidently be\r\ntrusted to take their share of fighting against a European foe.\r\n\r\nIn the British Army the superiority of one regiment over another is\r\nmainly a matter of training; the same courage and military instinct\r\nare inherent in English, Scotch, and Irish alike, but no comparison\r\ncan be made between the martial value of a regiment recruited amongst\r\nthe Gurkhas of Nepal or the warlike races of northern India, and of\r\none recruited from the effeminate peoples of the south.\r\n\r\nHow little this was understood, even by those who had spent a great\r\npart of their service in India, was a marvel to me; but, then, I\r\nhad had peculiar opportunities of judging of the relative fighting\r\nqualities of Natives, and I was in despair at not being able to get\r\npeople to see the matter with my eyes, for I knew that nothing was\r\nmore sure to lead to disaster than to imagine that the whole Indian\r\nArmy, as it was then constituted, could be relied on in time of war.\r\n\r\nGeneral Chesney fortunately shared my opinions, and as Lords Dufferin\r\nand Lansdowne trusted us, we were able to do a great deal towards\r\nincreasing the efficiency of the Native Army and improving the status\r\nand prospects of the Native soldier. Several companies and regiments\r\ncomposed of doubtful material were disbanded, and men of well-known\r\nfighting castes entertained instead. Class regiments were formed,\r\nas being more congenial to the men and more conducive to _esprit\r\nde corps_; recruiting was made the business of carefully selected\r\nofficers who understood Native character, and whose duty it was to\r\nbecome acquainted with the various tribes inhabiting the districts\r\nfrom which the recruits for their own regiments were drawn; and\r\nspecial arrangements were made with the Nepalese Government by which a\r\nsufficient number of the best class of men could be obtained for our\r\nthirteen Gurkha regiments.\r\n\r\nThe pay of Cavalry soldiers was improved, and it was pointed out to\r\nthe Government that an increase to the Infantry soldiers' pay\r\ncould not be long deferred;[3] the issue of good-conduct pay was\r\naccelerated; _jagirs_[4] were sanctioned annually for a limited number\r\nof specially distinguished Native officers; full pay was authorized\r\nfor recruits from date of enlistment instead of from the date of\r\njoining their regiments; field _batta_[5] was sanctioned whenever\r\ntroops should be employed beyond sea or on service; pensions were\r\ngranted after a shorter period of service than heretofore; medals for\r\nmeritorious service and good conduct were given in commemoration of\r\nHer Majesty's Jubilee; bronze war medals were sanctioned for all\r\nauthorized Government followers; a reserve, which it was arranged\r\nshould undergo an annual course of training, was formed for the\r\nArtillery and Infantry; and a system of linked battalions was\r\norganized, three battalions being grouped together, and the men being\r\ninterchangeable during war-time.\r\n\r\nWhile the tendency of these alterations and concessions was to make\r\nall ranks happy and contented, their training was carefully attended\r\nto, and, as I have before mentioned, musketry particularly reached a\r\nvery high standard.\r\n\r\nThe one thing left undone, and which I should like to have been able\r\nto accomplish before leaving India, was to induce the Government to\r\narrange for more British officers to be given to the Native regiments\r\nin time of war. Nine to a Cavalry and eight to an Infantry corps may\r\nbe sufficient in time of peace, but that number is quite too small\r\nto stand the strain of war. Indian soldiers, like soldiers of every\r\nnationality, require to be led; and history and experience teach us\r\nthat eastern races (fortunately for us), however brave and accustomed\r\nto war, do not possess the qualities that go to make leaders of men,\r\nand that Native officers in this respect can never take the place\r\nof British officers. I have known many Natives whose gallantry and\r\ndevotion could not be surpassed, but I have never known one who would\r\nnot have looked to the youngest British officer for support in time\r\nof difficulty and danger. It is therefore most unwise to allow Native\r\nregiments to enter upon a war with so much smaller a proportion of\r\nBritish officers than is considered necessary for European regiments.\r\nI have no doubt whatever of the fighting powers of our best Indian\r\ntroops; I have a thorough belief in, and admiration for, Gurkhas,\r\nSikhs, Dogras, Rajputs, Jats, and selected Mahomedans; I thoroughly\r\nappreciate their soldierly qualities; brigaded with British troops, I\r\nwould be proud to lead them against any European enemy; but we cannot\r\nexpect them to do with less leading than our own soldiers require, and\r\nit is, I maintain, trying them too highly to send them into action\r\nwith the present establishment of British officers.[6]\r\n\r\nIn the late autumn of 1891 our latest acquisition, the Zhob Valley,\r\nwas included in my frontier tour, which I had the pleasure of\r\nmaking, for the greater part of the way, in the company of General\r\nBrackenbury. He was prevented from getting as far as Quetta by an\r\naccident which laid him up for some time, but not, as he told me,\r\nbefore he had seen enough of the frontier to satisfy him that the\r\ntribes were a factor in our system of defence which could not be\r\nignored, and that I had not exaggerated the importance of having them\r\non our side.\r\n\r\nDuring this winter the brilliant little Hunza-Naga campaign took\r\nplace, which has been so graphically described in Mr. Knight's 'Where\r\nThree Empires Meet.' It was brought about by Russia's intrigues with\r\nthe Rulers of the petty States on the northern boundary of Kashmir;\r\nand our attention was first roused to the necessity for action by two\r\nBritish officers, who were journeying to India by way of the Pamirs\r\nand Gilgit, being forced by Russian soldiers to leave what the leader\r\nof the party called 'newly-acquired Russian territory '[7]--territory\r\nto which Russia had not the shadow of a claim.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this unjustifiable treatment of Captain Younghusband\r\nand Lieutenant Davison, Colonel Yanoff crossed the Hindu Kush with his\r\nCossacks by the Korabhut Pass, and, after reconnoitring the country on\r\nthe borders of Kashmir, re-crossed the range by the Baroghil Pass.\r\nAs this was a distinct breach of the promises made by the Russian\r\nGovernment, and an infringement of the boundary line as agreed to\r\nbetween England and Russia in 1873, it was necessary to take steps to\r\nprevent any recurrence of such interference, and a small force was\r\naccordingly sent against the Chief of Hunza, who had openly declared\r\nhimself in favour of Russia. He made a desperate stand, but was\r\neventually driven from his almost inaccessible position by the\r\ndetermined gallantry of our Indian troops, assisted by a Contingent\r\nfrom Kashmir. Three Victoria Crosses were given for this business, and\r\nmany more were earned, but of necessity there must be a limit to the\r\ndisposal of decorations; and in an affair of this kind, in which all\r\nproved themselves heroes, each individual must have felt himself\r\nhonoured by the small force being awarded such a large number of the\r\ncoveted reward, in proportion to its size.\r\n\r\nWe reaped the benefit of having taken this district under our own\r\ncontrol when Chitral required to be relieved, and the Hunza-Naga\r\npeople afforded Colonel Kelly such valuable help.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st January, 1892, I received an intimation that Her Majesty\r\nhad been graciously pleased to bestow a peerage upon me, and the same\r\nday the Secretary of State for India offered me a further extension\r\nof my appointment as Commander-in-Chief--an offer I would gladly have\r\naccepted, as I knew it had been made with the concurrence of the\r\nViceroy, if I could have taken even a few months' leave to England.\r\nBut during a quarter of a century I had only been able to spend\r\neighteen months out of India, and I felt the need of change of climate\r\nand a little rest after so many years of continued hard work. Under\r\nthe existing regulations a Commander-in-Chief could have no leave.\r\nLord Cross had tried to remedy this hard rule by bringing in the\r\n'Officers' Leave Bill'; but as he informed Lord Lansdowne it was\r\nimpossible to get it through the House of Commons that session, I was\r\nobliged very reluctantly to beg to be allowed to resign my command in\r\nthe spring of 1893.\r\n\r\nBefore returning to Simla for really the last time, my wife and I made\r\nanother trip to Burma as far as Mandalay, and after this was over\r\nwe paid a most interesting visit to Nepal, having received the very\r\nunusual honour of an invitation to Khatmandu from Maharaja Bir\r\nShumsher Jung Rana Bahadur.\r\n\r\nKhatmandu is about a hundred miles from our frontier station of\r\nSegowli, by a very rough road over a succession of steep, high hills\r\nand along deep, narrow valleys, which would have been quite impossible\r\nfor a lady to travel by but for the excellent arrangements made by\r\nthe Nepalese officials; the last descent was the worst of all; we\r\nliterally dropped from one rock to the next in some places. But on\r\nreaching the base of the mountain all was changed. A beautifully\r\ncultivated valley spread itself out before us; comfortable tents were\r\nprepared for our reception, where we were met by some of the State\r\nofficials; and a perfectly appointed carriage-and-four was waiting\r\nto carry us on to Khatmandu, where we were received by the Resident,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Wylie, and his wife, old friends of ours. That\r\nafternoon the Maharaja paid me a private visit.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the official call was made, which I returned soon\r\nafterwards; and in the evening the Maharaja, accompanied by his eldest\r\nson and eight of his brothers, all high officers of state, were\r\npresent at Mrs. Wylie's reception, wearing military frock-coats and\r\nforage-caps. They all spoke English fluently; their manners were those\r\nof well-bred gentlemen, easy and quiet, as free from awkwardness as\r\nfrom forwardness; each, coming up in turn, talked very pleasantly\r\nto Lady Roberts for a time, and then made way for someone else. The\r\nMaharaja is extremely musical, and has several well-trained bands,\r\ntaught by an English bandmaster; three of them were in attendance, and\r\nwere directed to play selections from our favourite operas, and then a\r\nnumber of the beautiful plaintive Nepalese airs. Altogether, we passed\r\na most agreeable evening.\r\n\r\nThe following day a review of all the troops (18,000 men and 78\r\nguns)[8] was held on a ground one mile in length by half a mile in\r\nbreadth, perfectly level and well turfed. It would be considered a\r\nfine parade-ground for the plains of India, and must have entailed a\r\nconsiderable expenditure of time, labour, and money to make in such a\r\nhilly place as Khatmandu.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the ground, I was received by the Maharaja and Deb\r\nShamsher Jung, the eldest of his many brothers, and the nominal\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the army; we rode along the line together,\r\nand the march past then began. Everything was done with the utmost\r\nprecision; there was no fuss or talking, and from first to last not a\r\nsingle bugle sound was heard, showing how carefully officers and men\r\nhad been drilled. I was told that the executive Commander-in-Chief,\r\nthe third brother, by name Chandra Shamsher, had almost lived on the\r\nparade-ground for weeks before my arrival. The Maharaja's sons\r\nand brothers, who all knew their work, and were evidently fond of\r\nsoldiering, commanded the several divisions and brigades.\r\n\r\nThe troops were not, perhaps, turned out quite so smartly as those\r\nin our service, and several of the officers were old and feeble; but\r\nthese were the only faults perceptible, and I came to the conclusion\r\nthat the great majority of the 18,000 men were quite as good as the\r\nGurkhas we enlist; and I could not help thinking that they would be a\r\nvaluable addition to our strength in the event of war.\r\n\r\nGeneral Chandra Shamsher is a very red-hot soldier. He said to my\r\nwife: 'Lady Roberts, when are the Russians coming? I wish they would\r\nmake haste. We have 40,000 soldiers in Nepal ready for war, and there\r\nis no one to fight!'\r\n\r\nThe next day a grand durbar was held, at which the King (the Maharaja\r\nDhiraj, as he is called) presided; he was an unusually handsome lad\r\nof about eighteen years of age, fairer than most Nepalese, and very\r\nrefined looking. As on all previous occasions, everyone wore uniform\r\nexcept the King, who had on a perfectly plain dress of spotless white.\r\nGreat deference is outwardly paid to the Dhiraj, but he has no power,\r\nand is never consulted in matters of State, being considered too\r\nsacred to be troubled with mundane affairs. Although a mere boy, he\r\nhad four wives, two of them daughters of the Maharaja Bir Shamsher\r\nJung.\r\n\r\nAfter the durbar, I was shown over the principal school and hospital;\r\nboth appeared to be well conducted, and evidently no expense was\r\nspared upon them. I was then taken to a magazine, in which were a\r\nnumber of guns of various calibre and any amount of ammunition. I was\r\ntold there were several other magazines, which I had not time to see,\r\nand a few miles from Khatmandu extensive workshops, where all kinds of\r\nmunitions of war were manufactured.\r\n\r\nThat evening, accompanied by Colonel and Mrs. Wylie, we attended a\r\nreception at the Maharaja's palace. The durbar hall, which was filled\r\nwith men in uniform, was of beautiful proportions, and very handsomely\r\ndecorated and furnished. After the usual introductions and some\r\nconversation with the chief officers, we were invited to visit the\r\nMaharani in her own apartments, and having ascended a flight of steps\r\nand passed through numerous corridors and luxuriously furnished rooms,\r\nwe were shown into a spacious apartment, the prevailing colour of\r\nwhich was rose, lighted by lamps of the same colour. The Maharani\r\nwas sitting on a sofa at the further end of the room, gorgeously\r\napparelled in rose-coloured gauze dotted over with golden spangles;\r\nher skirts were very voluminous, and she wore magnificent jewels on\r\nher head and about her person. Two Maids of Honour stood behind her,\r\nholding fans, and dressed in the same colour as their mistress, but\r\nwithout jewels. On each side of her, forming a semicircle, were\r\ngrouped the ladies of the Court, all arrayed in artistically\r\ncontrasting colours; they were more or less pretty and refined\r\nlooking, and the Maharani herself was extremely handsome. My wife was\r\nplaced by her side on the sofa, and carried on a long conversation\r\nwith her through one of the ladies who spoke Hindustani and acted as\r\nInterpreter. The Maharani presented Lady Roberts with a beautiful\r\nlittle Chinese pug-dog, and the Maharaja gave me a gold-mounted\r\n_kookri_ (Gurkha knife). After this little ceremony there was a grand\r\ndisplay of fireworks, and we took our leave.\r\n\r\nNothing could exceed the kindness we met with during our stay in\r\nNepal. The Maharaja endeavoured in every way to make our visit\r\nenjoyable, and his brothers vied with each other in their efforts to\r\ndo us honour. It was impressed upon me that the Nepalese army was at\r\nthe disposal of the Queen-Empress, and hopes were repeatedly expressed\r\nthat we would make use of it in the event of war.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the occasional differences which have occurred between\r\nour Government and the Nepal Durbar, I believe that, ever since 1817,\r\nwhen the Nepal war was brought to a successful conclusion by Sir David\r\nOchterlony, the Gurkhas have had a great respect and liking for us:\r\nbut they are in perpetual dread of our taking their country, and they\r\nthink the only way to prevent this is not to allow anyone to enter\r\nit except by invitation, and to insist upon the few thus favoured\r\ntravelling by the difficult route that we traversed. Nepal can never\r\nbe required by us for defensive purposes, and as we get our best class\r\nof Native soldiers thence, everything should, I think, be done to show\r\nour confidence in the Nepalese alliance, and convince them that we\r\nhave no ulterior designs on the independence of their kingdom.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Nepal we made a short tour in the Punjab, and then went to\r\nSimla for the season.\r\n\r\nOne of the subjects which chiefly occupied the attention of the\r\nGovernment at this time was the unfriendly attitude of the Ruler of\r\nAfghanistan towards us. Abdur Rahman Khan appeared to have entirely\r\nforgotten that he owed everything to us, and that, but for our support\r\nand lavish aid in money and munitions of war, he could neither have\r\ngained nor held the throne of Kabul. We refused to Sher Ali much that\r\nwe could have gracefully granted and that would have made him a firm\r\nfriend, but in our dealings with Abdur Rahman we rushed into the other\r\nextreme, and showered favours upon him; in fact, we made too much\r\nof him, and allowed him to get out of hand. The result was that he\r\nmistook the patience and forbearance with which we bore his fits\r\nof temper for weakness, and was encouraged in an overweening and\r\naltogether unjustifiable idea of his own importance; he considered\r\nthat he ought to be treated as the equal of the Shah of Persia, and\r\nkeenly resented not being allowed to communicate direct with Her\r\nMajesty's Ministers.\r\n\r\nIn the hope of being able to establish more satisfactory relations\r\nwith the Amir, Lord Lansdowne invited him to come to India, and,\r\non His Highness pleading that his country was in too disturbed a\r\ncondition to admit of his leaving it, the Viceroy expressed his\r\nwillingness to meet him on the frontier, but Abdur Rahman evaded this\r\narrangement also under one pretext or another. It was at last proposed\r\nto send me with a Mission as far as Jalalabad, a proposal I gladly\r\naccepted, for I was sanguine enough to hope that, by personal\r\nexplanation, I should be able to remove the suspicions which the\r\nAmir evidently entertained as to the motives for our action on the\r\nfrontier, and to convince him that our help in the time of his need\r\nmust depend upon our mutually agreeing in what manner that help should\r\nbe given, and on arrangements being completed beforehand to enable our\r\ntroops to be rapidly transported to the threatened points.\r\n\r\nAbdur Rahman agreed to receive me in the autumn, and expressed\r\npleasure at the prospect of meeting me, but eventually he apparently\r\nbecame alarmed at the size of the escort by which the Government\r\nthought it necessary that I, as Commander-in-Chief, should be\r\naccompanied; and, as the time approached for the Mission to start,\r\nhe informed Lord Lansdowne that his health would not permit of his\r\nundertaking the journey to Jalalabad.\r\n\r\nThus the opportunity was lost to which I had looked forward as a\r\nchance for settling many vexed questions, and I am afraid that there\r\nhas been very little improvement in our relations with Abdur Rahman\r\nsince then, and that we are no nearer the completion of our plans for\r\nthe defence of his kingdom than we were four years ago[9]--a defence\r\nwhich (and this cannot be too strongly impressed upon the Amir) it\r\nwould be impossible for us to aid him to carry through unless Kabul\r\nand Kandahar are brought into connexion with the railway system of\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn, just before we left Simla, our friends bestowed upon my\r\nwife a farewell gift in the shape of a very beautiful diamond bracelet\r\nand a sum of money for her fund for 'Homes in the Hills, and Officers'\r\nHospitals,' made doubly acceptable by the kind words with which Lord\r\nLansdowne, on behalf of the donors, presented it. Shortly afterwards\r\nwe bade a regretful adieu to our happy home of so many years, and made\r\nour way to the Punjab for a final visit.\r\n\r\nWe spent a few days at Peshawar, and then went to Rawal Pindi to\r\nbe present at a Camp of Exercise, and see how the works under\r\nconstruction for the protection of the arsenal were progressing.\r\nThese works had been put in hand in 1890, when, according to my\r\nrecommendation, it had been decided not to fortify Multan. No place in\r\nthe Punjab appeared to my mind to possess the same military value as\r\nRawal Pindi, its strategical importance with regard to the right\r\nflank of the frontier line being hardly inferior to that of Quetta in\r\nrelation to the left flank; but of late the advisability of completing\r\nthe works had been questioned by my colleagues in Council, greatly\r\nto my concern, for I felt that it would be unwise to leave the\r\nelaboration of the defences of such a position until war should be\r\nimminent.[10]\r\n\r\nIn January, 1893, a series of farewell entertainments were organized\r\nfor me at Lahore by the people of the Punjab, as touching as they\r\nwere highly appreciated, and intensely gratifying. Amongst the crowds\r\nassembled in the Town Hall to bid me good-bye, I was greatly pleased\r\nto see, besides the Maharaja of Kashmir, Chiefs and men from beyond\r\nour frontier, from Kuram, from the confines of Baluchistan, even from\r\nthe wilds of Waziristan; for their presence on this occasion I felt to\r\nbe, not only a proof of their kindly feeling towards me personally,\r\nand of their approval of the measures for their safety and welfare\r\nthat I had always advocated, but a very distinct sign of the much\r\nto be desired change that was taking place in the sentiments of the\r\nborder tribes towards us as a nation.\r\n\r\nFour addresses were presented to me, from the Sikh*, Hindu*, Mahomedan*,\r\nand European* communities of the Punjab, respectively, which I will\r\nventure to give in the Appendix, as I feel sure that the spirit of\r\nloyalty which pervades them will be a revelation to many, and a source\r\nof satisfaction to all who are interested in the country to which we\r\nowe so much of our present greatness, and which I conceive to be the\r\nbrightest jewel in England's crown.\r\n\r\n(See Appendices XII, XIII, XIV, AND XV.)\r\n\r\nIt was a wonderful and moving scene upon which we looked from the\r\nplatform of the Town Hall on this memorable occasion, made up as\r\nit was of such different elements, each race and creed easily\r\nrecognizable from their different costumes and characteristics, but\r\nall united by the same kindly desire to do honour to their departing\r\nfriend, or comrade, for there were a great number of old soldiers\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nAt each place that we visited on our way to Calcutta there was the\r\nsame display of kindly regret at our departure; friends assembled to\r\nsee us off at the railway-stations, bands played 'Auld lang syne,' and\r\nhearty cheers speeded us on our way.\r\n\r\nIn February we went to Lucknow for a few days, when the Talukdars of\r\nOudh gave my wife and me an entertainment on a very splendid scale in\r\nthe Wingfield Park, and presented me with an address[11] and a sword\r\nof honour.\r\n\r\nOn our return to Calcutta, just before we left for England, the\r\nEuropean community entertained me at a dinner, at which more than two\r\nhundred were present, presided over by Sir James Mackay, K.C.I.E.,\r\nChairman of the Calcutta Chamber of Commerce. Sir James was far\r\ntoo kind and eulogistic in speaking of my services, but for his\r\nappreciative allusion to my wife I could only feel deeply gratified\r\nand thankful. After dinner a reception was given to Lady Roberts and\r\nmyself, at which the Viceroy and Lady Lansdowne and all the principal\r\nNative and European residents of Calcutta were assembled. An\r\naddress[12] was presented to me on this never-to be-forgotten\r\noccasion, in which, to my supreme satisfaction, the Native noblemen\r\nand gentlemen expressed their hearty approval of what had been done\r\nduring my tenure of office as Commander-in-Chief to strengthen the\r\ndefences of the frontier and render the army in India efficient,\r\nand declared that 'we cheerfully bear our share of the cost, as in\r\npossession of these protections against aggressions from without we\r\nbelieve all who dwell within the borders of the land will find their\r\nbest guarantee for peace, and in peace the best safeguard they and\r\ntheir children can possess to enable them to pass their lives in\r\nhappiness and prosperity, and escape the misery and ruin which follow\r\nwar and invasion.'\r\n\r\nWe travelled to Bombay _viâ_ Jeypur and Jodhpur. At both places we\r\nwere royally entertained by the Rulers of those states, and my staff\r\nand I were given excellent sport amongst the wild boar, which was much\r\nenjoyed by all, particularly by my son, who, having joined the King's\r\nRoyal Rifles at Rawal Pindi, was attached to me as A.D.C. during my\r\nlast six months in India, and had not before had an opportunity of\r\ntasting the joys of pig-sticking.\r\n\r\nAt Jodhpur my friend the Maharaja Sir Pertap Sing gave us a signal\r\nproof that the ancient valour of the Rajputs had not deteriorated in\r\nthe present day. I had wounded a fine boar, and on his making for some\r\nrocky ground, where I could hardly have followed him on horseback, I\r\nshouted to Sir Pertap to get between him and the rocks, and turn him\r\nin my direction. The Maharaja promptly responded, but just as he came\r\nface-to-face with the boar, his horse put his foot into a hole and\r\nfell; the infuriated animal rushed on the fallen rider, and, before\r\nthe latter could extricate himself, gave him a severe wound in the leg\r\nwith his formidable tushes. On going to his assistance, I found Sir\r\nPertap bleeding profusely, but standing erect, facing the boar and\r\nholding the creature (who was upright on his hind-legs) at arms'\r\nlength by his mouth. The spear without the impetus given by the horse\r\nat full speed is not a very effective weapon against the tough hide\r\nof a boar's back, and on realizing that mine did not make much\r\nimpression, Pertap Sing, letting go his hold of the boar's mouth,\r\nquickly seized his hind-legs, and turned him over on his back, crying:\r\n'_Maro, sahib, maro!_' ('Strike, sir, strike!') which I instantly did,\r\nand killed him. Anyone who is able to realize the strength and weight\r\nof a wild boar will appreciate the pluck and presence of mind of Sir\r\nPertap Sing in this performance. Fortunately, my wife and daughter,\r\nwho had been following the pig-stickers in a light cart, were close at\r\nhand, and we were able to drive my friend home at once. The wound was\r\nfound to be rather a bad one, but it did not prevent Sir Pertap from\r\nattending some tent-pegging and other amusements in the afternoon,\r\nthough he had to be carried to the scene.\r\n\r\nA few months after my return to England the boar's head arrived,\r\nset up, and with a silver plate attached to it, on which was an\r\ninscription commemorating the adventure.\r\n\r\nAt Ahmedabad, where the train stopped while we lunched, I was\r\npresented with an address by the President and members of the\r\nMunicipality, who, 'with loyal devotion to Her Imperial Majesty the\r\nQueen and Empress of India, to whose glorious reign we sincerely wish\r\na continuance of brilliant prosperity,' expressed their hope that Lady\r\nRoberts and I would have 'a happy voyage home and enjoyment of perfect\r\nhealth and prosperity in future.'\r\n\r\nThe day before we left Bombay for England, the members of the Byculla\r\nClub gave me a parting dinner. It was with great difficulty I could\r\nget through my speech in response to the toast of my health on that\r\noccasion, for, pleased and grateful as I was at this last mark of\r\nfriendship and approval from my countrymen, I could not help feeling\r\ninexpressibly sad and deeply depressed at the thought uppermost in\r\nmy mind, that the time had come to separate myself from India and my\r\ngallant comrades and friends, British and Native.\r\n\r\nIn dwelling on the long list of farewell addresses and entertainments\r\nwith which I was honoured on leaving India, I feel that I may be\r\nlaying myself open to the charge of egotism; but in writing of one's\r\nown experiences it is difficult to avoid being egotistical, and\r\ndistasteful as it is to me to think that I may be considered so,\r\nI would rather that, than that those who treated me so kindly and\r\ngenerously should deem me unmindful or ungrateful.\r\n\r\nThus ended forty-one years in India. No one can, I think, wonder that\r\nI left the country with heartfelt regret. The greater number of my\r\nmost valued friendships had been formed there; from almost everyone\r\nwith whom I had been associated, whether European or Native, civilian\r\nor soldier, I had experienced unfailing kindness, sympathy, and\r\nsupport; and to the discipline, bravery, and devotion to duty of the\r\nArmy in India, in peace and war, I felt that I owed whatever success\r\nit was my good fortune to achieve.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The late Lieutenant-General Sir W.K. Elles, K.C.B.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: A detachment of the Calcutta Volunteer Rifles, at the\r\nparticular request of the regiment, took part in the expedition, and\r\ndid good service.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The pay of the Native Infantry has been suitably\r\nincreased since I left India.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Jagirs_ are grants of land.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Batta_, extra allowances given to Native soldiers when\r\nproceeding on field service.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: During the Mutiny the casualties amongst the British\r\nofficers with the six Punjab regiments which saw the most fighting\r\namounted to 60 per cent.! Luckily, these were able to be replaced by\r\nofficers belonging to corps which had mutinied. This supply, however,\r\nhas long since been used up, and it behoves the Government either\r\nto provide an adequate reserve of officers, or to arrange for a\r\nsufficient number being sent out from England whenever India is likely\r\nto be engaged in a serious war.\r\n\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|             | Number of  |                 CASUALTIES               |\r\n|             | Officers   +------------------------------------------+\r\n|    CORPS.   | who did    |Killed | Died  |        |        |        |\r\n|             | Duty with  |  in   |  of   |Died of |        |  In-   |\r\n|             | each Corps.|Action.|Wounds.|Disease.|Wounded.|valided.|\r\n+-------------+------------+-------+-------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n| 1st Punjab  |            |       |       |        |        |        |\r\n|  Cavalry (1 |            |       |       |        |        |        |\r\n|  squadron)  |     12     |   1   |  ...  |  ...   |    6   |   7    |\r\n| 2nd Punjab  |            |       |       |        |                 |\r\n|  Cavalry    |     20     |   1   |  ...  |  ...   |    5   |   4    |\r\n| 5th Punjab  |            |       |       |        |        |        |\r\n|  Cavalry (1 |            |       |       |        |        |        |\r\n|  squadron)  |      7     |   1   |   1   |  ...   |  ...   |  ...   |\r\n| 1st Punjab  |            |       |       |        |        |        |\r\n|  Infantry   |     15     |   3   |  ...  |  ...   |    6   |  ...   |\r\n| 2nd Punjab  |            |       |       |        |        |        |\r\n|  Infantry   |     22     |   3   |  ...  |  ...   |    4   |    3   |\r\n| 4th Punjab  |            |       |       |        |        |        |\r\n|   Infantry  |     24     |   2   |   3   |    2   |    8   |  ...   |\r\n+-------------+------------+-------+-------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n|   Total     |    100     |  11   |   4   |    2   |   29   |   14   |\r\n+-------------+------------+-------+-------+--------+--------+--------+]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Captain Younghushand was at Bozai-Gumbaz, and Lieutenant\r\nDavison on the Alichur Pamirs, both places being south of the Aksu\r\nbranch of the Oxus, flowing from the Little Pamir Lake.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: The Infantry comprised twenty-four battalions drawn up in\r\nline of quarter columns.

The reasons given were that a change of\r\nplans was necessary for economy's sake, and that the construction of\r\nfortifications might induce the Natives to think we were doubtful of\r\nthe continuance of our supremacy. As regarded the first, I explained\r\nthat the total outlay for works and armaments was estimated at only\r\n£332,274--considerably less than one half the cost of a British\r\nline-of-battle ship; and as to the second, I urged that an argument\r\nof this sort against frontier defences would hardly bear examination;\r\nthat the possibility of external attack was freely discussed in every\r\nnewspaper; that Russian movements and frontier difficulties were\r\nknown and commented on in every bazaar; that the construction of\r\nfortifications in support of the Ruling Power had been an Oriental\r\npractice from time immemorial; that our action in this respect was at\r\nleast as likely to instil the idea that we meant to retain our eastern\r\npossessions at any cost, as to give an impression of weakness; that\r\nthe progressive re-organization and mobilization of our army were well\r\nknown to have reference to service beyond the frontier; and that we\r\nhad extended our confidence in this respect to Native Princes by\r\nencouraging them to train their own troops and fit them to take their\r\nplace in line with ours.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Given in the Appendix. (Appendix XVI.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: _Ibid._ (Appendix XVII.)]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I.\r\n\r\n(See Chapter XIV, Footnote 4.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 9th Native Infantry, to which Captain Donald Stewart belonged, was\r\ndivided between Aligarh, Mainpuri, Bulandshahr, and Etawa, Stewart\r\nbeing with the Head-Quarters of the regiment at Aligarh.\r\n\r\nThe news from Meerut and Delhi had caused a certain amount of alarm\r\namongst the residents at Aligarh, and arrangements had been made for\r\nsending away the ladies and children, but, owing to the confidence\r\nplaced in the men of the 9th, none of them had left the station.\r\nHappen what might in other regiments, the officers were certain that\r\nthe 9th could never be faithless to their salt! The Native officers\r\nand men were profuse in their expressions of loyalty, and as a proof\r\nof their sincerity they arrested and disarmed several rebel sepoys,\r\nwho were making for their homes in Oudh and the adjoining districts.\r\nAs a further proof, they gave up the regimental pandit for\r\nendeavouring to persuade them to mutiny. He was tried by a\r\nCourt-Martial composed of European and Native officers, found guilty,\r\nand sentenced to be hanged. The sentence was carried out that same\r\nafternoon. It was intended that the regiment should witness the\r\nexecution, but it did not reach the gaol in time; the men were\r\ntherefore marched back to their lines, and Stewart, in his capacity of\r\nInterpreter, was ordered to explain to them the purpose for which\r\nthey had been paraded. While he was speaking a man of his own company\r\nshouted out something. Stewart did not hear the words, and no one\r\nwould repeat them. The parade was then dismissed, when the same man,\r\ntearing off his uniform, called upon his comrades not to serve a\r\nGovernment which had hanged a Brahmin. A general uproar ensued. The\r\nCommanding Officer ordered the few Sikhs in the regiment to seize the\r\nringleader; they did so, but not being supported by the rest they\r\nreleased him. The Subadar Major was then told to arrest the mutineer,\r\nbut he took no notice whatever of the order. This Native officer had\r\nbeen upwards of forty years in the regiment and was entitled to his\r\nfull pension. He had been a member of the Court-Martial which tried\r\nthe pandit, and, though a Brahmin himself, had given his vote in\r\nfavour of the prisoner being hanged; moreover he was a personal friend\r\nof all the officers. Stewart, who had been for many years Adjutant,\r\nknew him intimately, and believed implicitly in his loyalty. The man\r\nhad constantly discussed the situation with Stewart and others, and\r\nhad been mainly instrumental in disarming the sepoys who had passed\r\nthrough Aligarh; and yet when the hour of trial came he failed as\r\ncompletely as the last-joined recruit.\r\n\r\nThe British officers went amongst their men and tried to keep order,\r\nbut the excitement rapidly spread; some of the young soldiers began to\r\nload, and the older ones warned the officers that it was time for them\r\nto be off. The sepoys then plundered the treasury, broke open the gaol\r\ndoors, released the prisoners, and marched in a body towards Delhi.[1]\r\n\r\nStewart, being thus left without a regiment, attached himself to\r\nthe magistrate of the district, and took command of a small body of\r\nvolunteers sent from Agra by the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West\r\nProvinces, to aid the civil authorities in restoring order. Not caring\r\nfor this work, and thinking he might be more usefully employed,\r\nStewart made up his mind to find his way to Delhi; his idea was to try\r\nand get there _viâ_ Meerut, but before deciding on the route, he went\r\nto Agra, where he had been invited by the Lieutenant-Governor. At the\r\ninterview, Mr. Colvin advised Stewart to travel _viâ_ Muttra, as\r\nthe safer of the two routes, and told him that despatches had been\r\nreceived from the Government in Calcutta for the Commander-in-Chief,\r\nthen understood to be with the army before Delhi. At the same time the\r\nLieutenant-Governor impressed upon Stewart that he was not giving him\r\nany order to go, and that if he undertook to carry the despatches it\r\nmust be a voluntary act on his part, entailing no responsibility on\r\nthe Government of the North-West Provinces.\r\n\r\nStewart accepted the duty, and took his leave of Mr. Colvin as the sun\r\nwas setting on the 18th June, delighted at the chance of being able\r\nto join the army before Delhi. He reached Muttra, thirty-five miles\r\ndistant, without mishap. The streets of this city were crowded\r\nwith men, all carrying arms of some sort; they showed no signs of\r\nhostility, however, and even pointed out to Stewart the house of which\r\nhe was in search. The owner of this house, to whose care he had been\r\ncommended by the Agra authorities, was a Brahmin holding an official\r\nposition in the town. This Native gentleman behaved with civility,\r\nbut did not attempt to conceal his embarrassment at the presence of a\r\nBritish officer, or his relief when Stewart announced his intention of\r\nresuming his journey an hour or so before daybreak.\r\n\r\nThe Brahmin provided him with two sowars belonging to the Raja of\r\nBhartpur with orders to accompany him as far as Kosi. They were\r\ncut-throat-looking individuals, and Stewart felt rather inclined to\r\ndispense with their services, but, thinking it unwise to show any\r\nsigns of distrust, he accepted them with the best grace he could.\r\n\r\nAfter riding fifteen or sixteen miles, Stewart's horse fell from\r\nexhaustion, on which his so-called escort laughed uproariously, and\r\ngalloped off, leaving our poor traveller to his own devices.\r\n\r\nBelieving the horse could not recover, Stewart took off the saddle and\r\nbridle and tramped to the nearest village, where he hoped to be\r\nable to buy or hire an animal of some kind on which to continue his\r\njourney. No one, however, would help him, and he was forced to seize\r\na donkey which he found grazing in a field hard by. About sunset he\r\nreached Kosi, thirty-seven miles from Muttra. The _tehsildar_[2]\r\nreceived him courteously, and gave him some bread and milk, but would\r\nnot hear of his staying for the night. He told him that his appearance\r\nin the town was causing considerable excitement, and that he could not\r\nbe responsible for his safety. Stewart was much exhausted after his\r\nhot ride, but as the _tehsildar_ stood firm there was nothing for him\r\nto do but to continue his journey, and he consented to start if he\r\nwere provided with a horse. The _tehsildar_ promptly offered his own\r\npony, and as soon as it was dark Stewart set out for the Jaipur camp.\r\nHis progress during the night was slow, and it was not until eight\r\no'clock the next morning that he reached his destination, where he was\r\nhospitably received by the Political Agent, Major Eden, who introduced\r\nhim to the Maharaja's Wazir. This official at first promised to give\r\nStewart a small escort as far as Delhi, but on various pretexts he put\r\nhim off from day to day. At the end of a week Stewart saw that the\r\nWazir either could not or would not give him an escort, and thinking\r\nit useless to delay any longer, he made up his mind to start without\r\none.\r\n\r\nThere were several refugees in the camp, and one of them, Mr. Ford,\r\ncollector and magistrate of Gurgaon, offered to join Stewart in his\r\nventure.\r\n\r\nStewart and his companion left the Jaipur camp on the afternoon of\r\nthe 27th June, and reached Palwal soon after dark. Ford sent for the\r\n_kotwal_,[3] who was one of his own district officials, and asked him\r\nfor food. This was produced, but the _kotwal_ besought the _sahibs_ to\r\nmove on without delay, telling them that their lives were in imminent\r\ndanger, as there was a rebel regiment in the town, and he was quite\r\nunable to protect them. So they continued their journey, and, escaping\r\nfrom one or two threatened attacks by robbers, reached Badshahpur in\r\nthe morning. Here they rested during the heat of the day, being kindly\r\ntreated by the villagers, who were mostly Hindus.\r\n\r\nThe travellers were now not far from Delhi, but could hardly proceed\r\nfurther without a guide, and the people of Badshahpur declined to\r\nprovide one. They pleaded that they were men of peace, and could not\r\npossibly leave their village in such evil times. Suddenly a man from\r\nthe crowd, offered his services. His appearance was against him, and\r\nthe villagers declared that he was a notorious cattle-lifter, who was\r\nstrongly suspected of having set fire to the collector's (Mr. Ford's)\r\noffice at Gurgaon, in order that the evidences of his offences might\r\nbe destroyed. Not a pleasant _compagnon de voyage_, but there was\r\nnothing for it but to accept his offer.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was dark a start was made, and at daybreak on the\r\n29th the minarets of Delhi rose out of the morning mist, while an\r\noccasional shell might be seen bursting near the city.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the Hansi road, the guide, by name Jumna Das, who, in\r\nspite of appearances, had proved true to his word, stopped and said he\r\ncould go no further. He would not take any reward that it was then in\r\nthe power of Stewart or Ford to offer him, but he expressed a hope\r\nthat, when the country became settled, the slight service he had\r\nperformed would not be forgotten. They gratefully assured him on this\r\npoint, and thanked him cordially, giving him at the same time a letter\r\ntestifying to his valuable service. Stewart then went to the nearest\r\nvillage, and for a small reward found a man who undertook to conduct\r\nthem safely to one of our piquets.\r\n\r\nOne curious circumstance remarked by Stewart throughout the ride was\r\nthat the peasants and villagers, though not generally hostile to him,\r\nhad evidently made up their minds that the British _raj_ was at an\r\nend, and were busily engaged in rendering their villages defensible,\r\nto meet the troubles and disturbances which they considered would\r\nsurely follow on the resumption of Native rule.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to over-estimate the pluck and enterprise displayed\r\nby Stewart during this most adventurous ride. It was a marvel that he\r\never reached Delhi. His coming there turned out to be the best thing\r\nthat ever happened to him, for the qualities which prompted him to\r\nundertake and carried him through his dangerous journey, marked him as\r\na man worthy of advancement and likely to do well.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: While the regiment was in the act of mutinying one of the\r\nsepoys left the parade-ground, and running round to all the civilians'\r\nhouses, told the occupants what had happened, and warned them to make\r\ntheir escape. He asked for no reward, and was never seen again.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Native magistrate.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: City magistrate.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II.\r\n\r\n(These two memoranda are referred to in the note in Chapter XXV,\r\nFootnote 6.)\r\n\r\n_Memorandum by Lieutenant McLeod Innes._\r\n\r\n\r\n'1. Sir H. Lawrence joined at Lucknow about the end of March, 1857,\r\nsucceeding Mr. Coverley Jackson in the Chief Commissionership.\r\n\r\n'2. On his arrival he found himself in the midst of troubles, of which\r\nthe most important were these:\r\n\r\n    I. A general agitation of the empire, from the discontent of the\r\n    soldiery.\r\n\r\n    II. A weak European force at Oudh, with all the military\r\n    arrangements defective.\r\n\r\n    III. Grievous discontent among several classes of the population\r\n    of Oudh, viz., the nobility of Lucknow and the members and\r\n    retainers of the Royal Family, the official classes, the old\r\n    soldiery, and the entire country population, noble and peasant\r\n    alike.\r\n\r\n'3. This third was due to disobedience of, or departure from, the\r\ninstructions laid down by Government at the annexation, as very\r\nclearly shown in Lord Stanley's letter of October 13, 1858. The\r\npromised pensions had either been entirely withheld or very sparingly\r\ndoled out; the old officials were entirely without employment;\r\nthree-quarters of the army the same; while the country Barons had, by\r\nforced interpretation of rules, been deprived of the mass of their\r\nestates, which had been parcelled out among their followers, who, for\r\nclannish reasons, were more indignant at the spoliation and loss of\r\npower and place of their Chiefs than they were glad for their own\r\nindividual acquisitions.\r\n\r\n'4. The weakness of the European force could not be helped; it was\r\ndeemed politic to show the country that the annexation did not require\r\nforce.\r\n\r\n'5. But the inefficiency of the military arrangements arose from mere\r\nwant of skill, and was serious, under the threatening aspect of the\r\npolitical horizon.\r\n\r\n'6. The discontent of the province, and the coming general storm, had\r\nalready found vent in the brigandage of Fuzl Ali, and the seditions of\r\nthe Fyzabad Moulvie.\r\n\r\n'7. And with all these Sir H. Lawrence had to grapple immediately on\r\nhis arrival.\r\n\r\n'8. But I may safely say that ten days saw the mass of them disappear.\r\nThe Fyzabad Moulvie had been seized and imprisoned. Fuzl Ali had been\r\nsurrounded and slain. The promised pensions had been paid, by Sir H.\r\nLawrence's peremptory orders, to the members and retainers of the\r\nRoyal Family. A recognition had been published of the fair rights of\r\nthe old Oudh officials to employment in preference to immigrants from\r\nour old provinces, and instructions had been issued for giving it\r\neffect. The disbanded soldiers of the Royal Army of Oudh were promised\r\npreference in enlistment in the local corps and the police, and\r\na reorganization and increase to the latter, which were almost\r\nimmediately sanctioned, gave instant opportunities for the fulfilment\r\nof the first instalment of these promises. While last, but not least,\r\ndurbars were held, in which Sir Henry Lawrence was able to proclaim\r\nhis views and policy, by which the landholders should be reinstated in\r\nthe possessions which they held at the annexation, the basis on which\r\nthe instructions had been originally issued, which had been hitherto\r\npractically ignored, but to which he pledged himself to give effect.\r\n\r\n'9. To strengthen his military position, he placed Artillery with the\r\nEuropean Infantry; he distributed his Irregular Cavalry; he examined\r\nthe city, decided on taking possession of the Muchee Bawn and\r\ngarrisoning it as a fort; and summoned in Colonel Fisher and Captain\r\nGeorge Hardinge; and with them, Brigadier Handscombe and Major\r\nAnderson, consulted and arranged for future plans against the storms\r\nwhich he saw to be impending.\r\n\r\n'10. Much of this, and his policy for remaining in Oudh, and the\r\nconduct of the defence of Lucknow, I know from recollections of what\r\nhe occasionally let drop to me in his confidential conversations while\r\ninspecting the Muchee Bawn. He told me that nearly the whole army\r\nwould go; that he did not think the Sikhs would go; that in every\r\nregiment there were men that, with proper management, would remain\r\nentirely on our side; and that, therefore, he meant to segregate from\r\nthe rest of the troops the Sikhs and selected men, and to do his\r\nbest to keep them faithful allies when the rest should go; that, if\r\nCawnpore should hold out, we would not be attacked; but that if it\r\nshould fall, we would be invested, and more or less closely besieged;\r\nthat no troops could come to our relief before the middle of August;\r\nthat the besieging forces would, he thought, be confined to the\r\nsepoys, for the people of the country had always liked our European\r\nofficers, whom they had frequently had to bless for the safety of\r\ntheir lives and the honour of their families; and the whole Hindu\r\npopulation had a lively recollection of our friendly line of conduct\r\nin the late quarrel with the Mussulmans regarding the Hunnooman\r\nGurhee; that to hold out where we were was necessary, for the\r\nslightest appearance of yielding, or of not showing a bold front,\r\nwould result in annihilation; that to hold out we must get provisions;\r\nthat to got provisions and prepare for an efficient defence we must\r\nkeep open our communication with the country, and keep the city quiet;\r\nthat to the former end the retention of the cantonment was necessary,\r\nand of the Muchee Bawn to the latter, while the site of the permanent\r\ndefences, in case of the need of concentration, should be the\r\nResidency.\r\n\r\n'11. All this I know, as before said, from Sir Henry Lawrence's own\r\ncasual and hurried remarks to me. Whether they are officially recorded\r\nanywhere I do not know; but they must have been written in letters\r\nto various persons, and repeated to others of his subordinates at\r\nLucknow. I mention these matters thus early, as although the facts on\r\nwhich they bear did not immediately occur, still, Sir Henry Lawrence\r\nhad prescience of them, and had decided on his line of policy.\r\n\r\n'12. I understand, further, but not on authentic grounds, that Sir\r\nHenry wrote at a very early stage to Sir H. Wheeler, urging him to\r\nconstruct entrenchments at the magazine at Cawnpore, and to ensure his\r\ncommand of the boats, whatever might happen; that he wrote early\r\nto the Government, entreating them to divert one of the European\r\nregiments in the course of relief, and divide it between Cawnpore and\r\nAllahabad; and that subsequently he urged on Government to employ the\r\ntroops of the Persian expedition in Bengal, and to stop the Chinese\r\nforce for the same end, and to subsidize some of the Nepal troops for\r\nthe protection of our older provinces east of Oudh.\r\n\r\n'13. To revert to the narrative, the measures already mentioned\r\nso entirely pacified the province, that, in spite of the previous\r\ndiscontent, the previous troubles, the proverbial turbulence of its\r\ninhabitants, and the increasing agitation throughout the empire, there\r\nwas no difficulty experienced in collecting the revenue by the close\r\nof April. And the subsequent disturbances were, as will be shown,\r\nentirely due to the soldiery, and, till long after Sir Henry's death,\r\nparticipated in only by them, by the city ruffians, and by a few of\r\nthe Mussulman families of the country population. The mass of the city\r\npeople and the entire Hindu population held aloof, and would have\r\nnothing to say to the outbreak; and, with one single exception, every\r\nTalookdar, to whom the chance offered itself, aided, more or less\r\nactively, in the protection of European fugitives. This phase in the\r\ncharacter of the disturbances in Oudh is not generally known; but it\r\nis nevertheless true, and is due emphatically and solely, under Divine\r\nProvidence, to the benignant personal character and the popular policy\r\nof Sir Henry Lawrence.\r\n\r\n'14. The 1st of May saw our disturbances commence with the mutiny of\r\nthe 7th Oudh Irregular Infantry. This, its suppression, and the durbar\r\nin which he distributed rewards and delivered a speech on the aspect\r\nof affairs, have been fully described elsewhere, and need not be\r\nrepeated by me.\r\n\r\n'15. The durbar was held on the twelfth. I am not aware whether he had\r\nany intelligence at that time of the Meerut outbreak. The telegrams,\r\nwhen they did arrive, were vague; but he indubitably kept on his guard\r\nimmediately on receiving them. The Cavalry were piqueted between the\r\ncantonments and the Residency, and the Infantry and Artillery were\r\nkept prepared for movement. His plans were evidently already decided;\r\nbut they were to be effected simultaneously and not successively,\r\nand the movements of the Europeans were somewhat dependent on the\r\narrangements of the Quarter-master-General's Department. It was not\r\nuntil the sixteenth that the tents required for the 32nd were ready;\r\nand the morning of the 17th May saw an entirely new and effective\r\ndisposition of the troops. Half the Europeans were at the Residency,\r\ncommanding the Iron Bridge; half, with the Artillery, were at the\r\nsouth end of the cantonments; the bridge of boats was moved and under\r\ncontrol, while the Muchee Bawn, not yet sufficiently cleansed from\r\nits old conglomeration of filth, was garrisoned by a selected body of\r\nNative troops. The whole of these dispositions could not have been\r\neffected at an earlier date, and Sir Henry would not do them piecemeal\r\nor successively. Simultaneous, they were effective, and tended to\r\nparalyze any seditious plots that may have been hatching. Successive\r\nand piecemeal, they would have incited the sepoys to mutiny and the\r\nturbulent to insurrection.'\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum, 18th May, inserted in Sir Henry's own hand in his ledger\r\nbook._\r\n\r\n'Time is everything just now. Time, firmness, promptness,\r\nconciliation, and prudence; every officer, each individual European,\r\nhigh and low, may at this crisis prove most useful, or even dangerous.\r\nA firm and cheerful aspect must be maintained--there must be no\r\nbustle, no appearance of alarm, still less of panic; but, at the same\r\ntime, there must be the utmost watchfulness and promptness; everywhere\r\nthe first germ of insurrection must be put down instantly. Ten men may\r\nin an hour quell a row which, after a day's delay, may take weeks\r\nto put down. I wish this point to be well understood. In preserving\r\ninternal tranquillity, the Chiefs and people of substance may be most\r\nusefully employed at this juncture; many of them have as much to lose\r\nas we have. Their property, at least, is at stake. Many of them have\r\narmed retainers--some few are good shots and have double-barrelled\r\nguns. For instance [name illegible], can hit a bottle at 100 yards. He\r\nis with the ordinary soldiers. I want a dozen such men, European or\r\nNative, to arm their own people and to make _thannahs_ of their own\r\nhouses, or some near position, and preserve tranquillity within a\r\ncircuit around them.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX III.\r\n\r\n(Referred to in Chapter XLVI, Footnote 1.)\r\n\r\nThe column was composed as follows:\r\n\r\n                                      _Men._     _Guns._\r\n\r\nF Battery, A Brigade, R.H.A.,\r\ncommanded by Colonel W.

I am glad\r\n    to find your Highness is in good health, but sorry to hear of\r\n    the unfortunate disturbances in your Highness's dominions. Your\r\n    Highness's letter, in original, has been sent with enclosures to\r\n    His Excellency the Viceroy. I have already informed your Highness\r\n    of the wishes of His Excellency the Viceroy, and the reasons for\r\n    the movements of the British troops, and I have requested your\r\n    Highness to send a confidential representative to my camp.

Dated ALIKHEL, 23rd September, 1879._\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter compliments, General Roberts intimated to the Agents that at\r\ntheir desire he had granted them a second interview. He now requested\r\nthem to be good enough to speak freely all that they wished him to\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nThe MUSTAUFI then spoke in the following sense: The interests of\r\nEngland and Afghanistan are the same, and the Amir and his officials\r\nare deeply grieved at the late occurrences in Kabul. Moreover, the\r\nAmir is anxious to do whatever the British Government wishes, and\r\nmost desirous that the dignity of the British Government should be\r\nmaintained by any means which may seem proper to the Viceroy. But His\r\nHighness cannot conceal from himself that the mutinous troops and\r\nhis people in general, ryots as well as soldiers, are in fear of\r\nan indiscriminate revenge, which will fall alike upon innocent and\r\nguilty. He hopes, therefore, that measures will be taken to guard\r\nagainst the possibility of a general rising consequent on fear.\r\n\r\nThe Mustaufi was here reminded of the tenor of General Roberts's\r\nProclamation on 15th September. He answered that the people were too\r\nignorant to be acted upon by a Proclamation, and then went on as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nOf course, it is possible that no such combination may take place. The\r\nAfghans are selfish, and divided against themselves. Still, lest he\r\nshould be blamed if it should occur, the Amir thinks it right\r\nto express his opinion, and give the British Government all the\r\ninformation in his power. On the whole, his advice, as an earnest\r\nfriend, is that the advance of a British force on Kabul should be\r\ndelayed for a short time ('_Panjroz_'). In the interval he will\r\nendeavour to disarm the Regular troops, raise new levies, and, by\r\nthe aid of the latter, punish all concerned in the late abominable\r\noutrage. His idea is to get rid of Sher Ali's soldiery--always a\r\nsource of danger--and keep only 15,000 men for the future. It would\r\nbe very desirable to delay the advance until he could establish his\r\npower. The Amir does not mean to imply that any Afghan army, were it\r\n50,000 strong, could resist the British. The mutinous troops have\r\nneither organization nor leaders. But the mutinous troops are of all\r\ntribes; and if the British army destroys them, as it would undoubtedly\r\ndo in case of resistance, the whole country may combine against the\r\nBritish and the Amir. It is for this reason that he advises delay, and\r\nthat the punishment of the guilty be left to him. The Viceroy may rest\r\nassured that he will show no mercy. He will make an example which will\r\nbe conspicuous in the eyes of the world as the sun at noonday. Already\r\neveryone in Kabul regards the Amir as an infidel, because of the\r\nway in which he and his have thrown in their lot with the British\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all that has been said, however, things might go right\r\nif the mutinous troops would keep together and attempt a stand. But\r\nthe Amir fears they will not do so. They are more likely to scatter\r\nhere and there, and raise the country. In that case there will be\r\nconstant attacks on the communications of the force, and the gathering\r\nof supplies will be difficult. They would come chiefly from the\r\ndirection of Ghazni, partly also from Logar. If the tribes rise it\r\nwould be hard to collect them. Only one month remains before the\r\nsetting in of winter. Of course, it is impossible to say what may\r\nhappen. There may be no opposition, and the Amir is in any case ready\r\nto do what the British Government desires. But he feels it is his duty\r\nto express his strong opinion that the present season is unsuited for\r\na forward movement.\r\n\r\nGeneral Roberts replied that on behalf of the Viceroy he thanked the\r\nAmir for his kind advice, which he was confident was the advice of\r\na friend. He said the matter was important, and required careful\r\nconsideration, and asked whether the Agents had anything more to bring\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nThe Mustaufi then spoke as follows: The Amir's advice to delay the\r\nadvance is that of a sincere friend, and it is the best he can give.\r\nBut if the British Army is to march on Kabul, there is one thing more\r\nwhich I am desired to say: let it march in such strength as to crush\r\nall hopes of mischief, and put down all rebellion throughout the\r\ncountry. You cannot wait for reinforcements. If you come, you must\r\ncome in full strength--in sufficient strength to put down all\r\nopposition. There may be no opposition, but you cannot count on this.\r\n\r\nGeneral Roberts replied: The Amir's advice is of great importance,\r\nand must be carefully considered. When His Highness first wrote,\r\nannouncing the outbreak at Kabul and asking for help, the first desire\r\nof the Viceroy was to send British forces without delay. I was ordered\r\nto Kuram at once to lead the force here. Simultaneously the Kandahar\r\nforce was ordered by telegram to return to Kandahar, which it was then\r\nleaving, and to advance towards Kelat-i-Ghilzai, and instructions were\r\nissued to collect a third force at Peshawar; all this was to help the\r\nAmir. The Viceroy from the first contemplated the possibility of such\r\na general rising as the Amir now fears, and the several armies were,\r\ntherefore, by His Excellency's order, made up to such strength that\r\nall Afghanistan combined could not stand against them for a moment.\r\nThe Kandahar troops were ready in a very short time, and are now\r\nbeyond Kandahar, on the road to Kabul.[1] The Peshawar force was\r\nrapidly collected and pushed on; and the Amir may rest assured that\r\nthe British army is advancing in ample strength. I will think over the\r\nAmir's advice, nevertheless, for it is important. But His Highness\r\nmust remember that the late occurrences at Kabul do not affect only\r\nthe English officers and the fifty or sixty men who were treacherously\r\nkilled--the honour of the English Government is concerned; and so long\r\nas the bodies of these officers and men remain unburied or uncared for\r\nin Kabul, I do not believe the English people will ever be satisfied.\r\nThey will require the advance of a British force, and the adequate\r\npunishment of the crime. Still, the Amir's advice, which I am\r\nconvinced is that of a friend, must be carefully considered, and I\r\nwill think over it and give an answer later.\r\n\r\nThe MUSTAUFI then said: We quite understand what has been said about\r\nthe strength of the British army. Doubtless it is sufficient, and\r\nall Afghanistan could not stand against it. But the Amir asked us to\r\nmention, what I have hitherto forgotten, that there are in Turkestan\r\n24 regiments of Infantry, 6 of Cavalry, and 56 guns. These troops were\r\nthe first to show a disaffected spirit at Mazar-i-Sharif; and putting\r\naside external enemies, there are Abdur Rahman and the sons of Azim\r\nKhan waiting their chance. Herat again is doubtful; when the troops\r\nthere hear what has occurred at Kabul, there is no saying what they\r\nmay do. If Abdur Rahman ingratiates himself with these people, Herat\r\nand Turkestan will be permanently severed from the Afghan dominions.\r\nThis is another reason why the advance of the British force should be\r\ndelayed, in order that the Amir may have time to gain over the Herat\r\nand Turkestan troops.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ROBERTS replied: All these reasons will have full\r\nconsideration. The Viceroy's first order was to push on at once to\r\nhelp the Amir; but I am sure His Highness's advice is friendly, and\r\nthat in any case he will do his utmost to co-operate with the British\r\nGovernment. Therefore every consideration will be given to what His\r\nHighness has desired you to say.\r\n\r\nThe MUSTAUFI: The Viceroy may be sure the Amir will do what he\r\npleases.\r\n\r\nThe WAZIR: When the Amir learnt from General Roberts's letter that the\r\nViceroy had given General Roberts power to deal with the whole matter,\r\nhe was very pleased, knowing General Roberts's character as a soldier\r\nand his kindness of heart.\r\n\r\nGENERAL ROBERTS replied that he would carefully consider the proposals\r\nbrought forward, and give an answer later on. Meanwhile, he must\r\nrequest the Agents to stay a day or two in camp until he should\r\nhave thoroughly weighed the Amir's advice, which was of the utmost\r\nimportance to both the British and Afghan Governments.\r\n\r\nThe interview then came to an end.\r\n\r\n  (Signed)           H.

ROBERTS, K.C.B., V.C., Commanding\r\nKabul Field Force, to A.C. LYALL, ESQ., C.B., Secretary to the\r\nGovernment of India, Foreign Department._\r\n\r\n\r\n    KABUL, _22nd November,_ 1879.\r\n\r\n    1. I Have the honour to submit a brief account of an interview\r\n    which took place between the Amir Yakub Khan and myself on the\r\n    22nd October. The interview was a private and informal one; but\r\n    recent events have lent some interest to what passed on the\r\n    occasion, and I have, therefore, thought it desirable that\r\n    a report should be prepared for the information of the\r\n    Governor-General in Council.\r\n\r\n    2. After some conversation upon matters of no special importance,\r\n    the Amir introduced his father's name, and thus gave me the\r\n    opportunity I had often wished to have of leading him on to speak\r\n    naturally and unconstrainedly about Sher Ali Khan's feelings and\r\n    policy during the last ten years. I was most careful to avoid any\r\n    expression of my own views upon the subject in order that I might,\r\n    if possible, obtain from the Amir a perfectly spontaneous and\r\n    truthful account of the circumstances which led, in his opinion,\r\n    to Sher Ali's estrangement from ourselves and _rapprochement_ to\r\n    Russia. In this I think I succeeded. Yakub Khan spoke readily\r\n    and freely of all that had passed, and needed no question or\r\n    suggestion from me to declare his conviction regarding the cause\r\n    of his father's unfriendly attitude towards us during the past few\r\n    years.\r\n\r\n    3. The substance of the Amir's statement was as follows:\r\n\r\n    'In 1869 my father was fully prepared to throw in his lot with\r\n    you. He had suffered many reverses before making himself secure on\r\n    the throne of Afghanistan; and he had come to the conclusion that\r\n    his best chance of holding what he had won lay in an alliance with\r\n    the British Government. He did not receive from Lord Mayo as\r\n    large a supply of arms and ammunition as he had hoped, but,\r\n    nevertheless, he returned to Kabul fairly satisfied, and so he\r\n    remained until the visit of Saiyad Nur Muhammud to India in 1873.\r\n    This visit brought matters to a head. The diaries received from\r\n    Saiyad Nur Mahomed during his stay in India, and the report which\r\n    he brought back on his return, convinced my father that he could\r\n    no longer hope to obtain from the British Government all the aid\r\n    that he wanted; and from that time he began to turn his attention\r\n    to the thoughts of a Russian alliance. You know how this ended.\r\n\r\n    'When my father received from the Government of India the letter\r\n    informing him that a British Mission was about to proceed to\r\n    Kabul, he read it out in durbar. The members of the Russian\r\n    Embassy were present. After the reading was finished, Colonel\r\n    Stolietoff rose, saluted the Amir and asked permission to leave\r\n    Kabul. If permitted, he would, he said, travel without delay to\r\n    Tashkent, and report the state of affairs to General Kauffmann,\r\n    who would inform the Czar, and thus bring pressure to bear on\r\n    England. He promised to return in six weeks or two months, and\r\n    urged the Amir to do everything in his power meanwhile to prevent\r\n    the British Mission from reaching Kabul.\r\n\r\n    'Colonel Stolietoff never returned to Kabul. He lost no time in\r\n    reaching Tashkent, where he remained for a few weeks, and he then\r\n    started for Russia.\r\n\r\n    'The Afghan official, Mirza Mahomed Hassan Khan, generally known\r\n    as the \"Dabir-ul-Mulk,\" who had travelled with Colonel Stolietoff\r\n    from the Oxus to Kabul, accompanied him on his return journey to\r\n    Tashkent. Here the Mirza was detained under pretence that orders\r\n    would shortly be received from the Emperor, until the news of my\r\n    father's flight from Kabul reached General Kauffmann. He was then\r\n    permitted to leave. Two Aides-de-Camp were sent with him, one a\r\n    European, the other a Native of Bokhara.\r\n\r\n    'My father was strongly urged by General Kauffmann not to leave\r\n    Kabul. At the same time the members of the Embassy were ordered to\r\n    return to Tashkent, the Doctor being permitted to remain with my\r\n    father if his services were required.\r\n\r\n    'Throughout, the Russian Embassy was treated with great honour,'\r\n    and at all stations between Mazar-i-Shariff and Kabul, orders were\r\n    given for the troops to turn out, and for a salute to be fired on\r\n    their arrival and departure.'\r\n\r\n    4. I cannot, of course, vouch for the exact words used by Yakub\r\n    Khan, but I am confident that the foregoing paragraph, which is\r\n    written from notes taken at the time, contains a substantially\r\n    accurate record of the conversation.\r\n\r\n    5. It would be superfluous for me to advance any proof of the fact\r\n    that for one reason or another Sher Ali did during the latter part\r\n    of his reign fall away from us and incline towards an alliance\r\n    with Russia. But I think the closeness of the connection between\r\n    Russia and Kabul, and the extent of the Amir's hostility towards\r\n    ourselves, has not hitherto been fully recognized. Yakub Khan's\r\n    statements throw some light upon this question, and they are\r\n    confirmed by various circumstances which have lately come to my\r\n    knowledge. The prevalence of Russian coin and wares in Kabul,\r\n    and the extensive military preparations made by Sher Ali of late\r\n    years, appear to me to afford an instructive comment upon Yakub\r\n    Khan's assertions. Our recent rupture with Sher Ali has, in fact,\r\n    been the means of unmasking and checking a very serious conspiracy\r\n    against the peace and security of our Indian Empire.\r\n\r\n    6. The magnitude of Sher Ali's military preparations is, in my\r\n    opinion, a fact of peculiar significance. I have already touched\r\n    upon this point in a former letter, but I shall perhaps be excused\r\n    for noticing it again. Before the outbreak of hostilities last\r\n    year the Amir had raised and equipped with arms of precision 68\r\n    regiments of Infantry and 16 of Cavalry. The Afghan Artillery\r\n    amounted to nearly 300 guns. Numbers of skilled artizans were\r\n    constantly employed in the manufacture of rifled cannon and\r\n    breach-loading small arms. More than a million pounds of powder,\r\n    and I believe several million rounds of home-made Snider\r\n    ammunition, were in the Bala Hissar at the time of the late\r\n    explosion. Swords, helmets, uniforms, and other articles of\r\n    military equipment were stored in proportionate quantities.\r\n    Finally, Sher Ali had expended upon the construction of the\r\n    Sherpur cantonments an astonishing amount of labour and money. The\r\n    extent and cost of this work may be judged of from the fact that\r\n    the whole of the troops under my command will find cover during\r\n    the winter within the cantonment, and the bulk of them in the main\r\n    line of rampart itself, which extends to a length of nearly two\r\n    miles under the southern and western slopes of the Bimaru hills.\r\n    Sher Ali's original design was apparently to carry the wall\r\n    entirely round the hills, a distance of nearly five miles, and the\r\n    foundations were already laid for a considerable portion of this\r\n    length. All these military preparations were quite unnecessary\r\n    except as a provision for contemplated hostilities with ourselves,\r\n    and it is difficult to understand how their entire cost could\r\n    have been met from the Afghan treasury, the gross revenue of the\r\n    country amounting only to about eighty lakhs of rupees per annum.\r\n\r\n    7. I have referred to the prevalence of Russian coin and wares\r\n    in Kabul as evidence of the growing connexion between Russia and\r\n    Afghanistan. I am unable to find proof that the Czar's coin was\r\n    introduced in any other way than by the usual channels of trade.\r\n    It is quite possible that the bulk of it, if not the whole, came\r\n    in gradually by this means, the accumulation of foreign gold in\r\n    particular being considerable in this country, where little gold\r\n    is coined. Nevertheless, it seems to me a curious fact that the\r\n    amount of Russian money in circulation should be so large. No\r\n    less than 13,000 gold pieces were found among the Amir's treasure\r\n    alone; similar coins are exceedingly common in the city bazaar;\r\n    and great numbers of them are known to be in possession of the\r\n    Sirdars. Of course English goods of all kinds are plentiful\r\n    here--that is inevitable, particularly with a considerable body\r\n    of Hindu merchants settled in the city, but Russian goods also\r\n    abound. Glass, crockery, silks, tea, and many other things which\r\n    would seem to be far more easily procurable from India than from\r\n    Russian territory, are to be found in great quantities. A habit,\r\n    too, seems to have been growing up among the Sirdars and others of\r\n    wearing uniforms of Russian cut, Russian buttons, Russian boots,\r\n    and the like. Russian goods and Russian ways seem, in fact, to\r\n    have become the fashion in Afghanistan.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX VII.\r\n\r\n(Referred to in Chapter LIII, Footnote 3.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Translations of letters from _GENERAL-ADJUTANT VON KAUFFMANN,\r\n_Governor-General of Turkestan, to the address of the_ AMIR OF\r\nAFGHANISTAN, _received on 10th, Shaban, 1295, through_ GENERAL\r\nSTOLIETOFF, _9th August, 1878._\r\n\r\n    Be it known to you that in these days the relations between the\r\n    British Government and ours with regard to your kingdom require\r\n    deep consideration.

As I am unable to see you, I have deputed my\r\n    trustworthy (official) General Stolietoff to you. The General\r\n    is an old friend of mine, and during the late Russo-Turkish war\r\n    earned the favour of the Emperor by his spirit and bravery. He has\r\n    become well known to the Emperor. This trustworthy person will\r\n    communicate to you what he thinks best. I hope you will pay\r\n    attention to what he says, and repose as much confidence in his\r\n    words as if they were my own; and that you will give your answer\r\n    in this matter through him. In the meantime, be it known to you\r\n    that if a friendly treaty will be of benefit to us, it will be of\r\n    far greater benefit to yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL STOLIETOFF _sent the following letter, on his return to\r\nTashkent from Kabul, to the address of the Foreign Minister, _WAZIR\r\nSHAH MAHOMED KHAN, _dated 23rd of the holy month of Ramazan, 1295 ( =\r\n21st September, 1878)._\r\n\r\n    Thank God, I reached Tashkent safely, and at an auspicious moment\r\n    paid my respects to the Viceroy (Yaroni Padishah means 'half\r\n    king'). I am trying day and night to gain our objects, and hope I\r\n    shall be successful. I am starting to see the Emperor to-day, in\r\n    order to inform His Majesty personally of our affairs. If God\r\n    pleases, everything that is necessary will be done and affirmed.\r\n    _I hope that those who want to enter the gate of Kabul from the\r\n    east will see that the door is closed; then, please God, they will\r\n    tremble._ I hope you will give my respects to His Highness the\r\n    Amir.

Be it known to you that your letter, dated\r\n    12th Shawal, reached me at Tashkent on the 16th October, _i.e._,\r\n    3rd Zekada, and I understood its contents. I have telegraphed an\r\n    abstract of your letter to the address of the Emperor, and\r\n    have sent the letter itself, as also that addressed to General\r\n    Stolietoff, by post to Livadia, where the Emperor now is. I am\r\n    informed on good authority that the English want to come to terms\r\n    with you; and, as a friend, I advise you to make peace with them\r\n    if they offer it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From_ GENERAL STOLIETOFF _to_ WAZIR SHAH MAHOMED KHAN, _dated 8th\r\nOctober 1878._\r\n\r\n    First of all, I hope you will be kind enough to give my respects\r\n    to the Amir. May God make his life long and increase his wealth!\r\n    I shall always remember his royal hospitality. I am busy day and\r\n    night in his affairs, and, thank God, my labours have not been\r\n    without result. The great Emperor is a true friend of the Amir's\r\n    and of Afghanistan, and His Majesty will do whatever he may think\r\n    necessary. Of course, you have not forgotten what I told you,\r\n    that the affairs of kingdoms are like a country which has many\r\n    mountains, valleys, and rivers. One who sits on a high mountain\r\n    can see things well. By the power and order of God, there is no\r\n    empire equal to that of our great Emperor. May God make his life\r\n    long! Therefore, whatever our Government advises you, you should\r\n    give ear to it. I tell you the truth that our Government is wise\r\n    as a serpent and harmless as a dove. There are many things which\r\n    you cannot understand, but our Government understands them well.\r\n    It often happens that a thing which is unpleasant at first is\r\n    regarded as a blessing afterwards. Now, my kind friend, I inform\r\n    you that the enemy of your famous religion wants to make peace\r\n    with you through the Kaisar (Sultan) of Turkey. Therefore you\r\n    should look to your brothers who live on the other side of the\r\n    river. If God stirs them up, and gives the sword of fight into\r\n    their hands, then go on, in the name of God (Bismilla), otherwise\r\n    you should be as a serpent; make peace openly, and in secret\r\n    prepare for war, and when God reveals His order to you, declare\r\n    yourself. It will be well, when the Envoy of your enemy wants to\r\n    enter the country, if you send an able emissary, possessing the\r\n    tongue of a serpent and full of deceit, to the enemy's country, so\r\n    that he may with sweet words perplex the enemy's mind, and induce\r\n    him to give up the intention of fighting with you.\r\n\r\n    My kind friend, I entrust you to the protection of God. May God be\r\n    the protector of the Amir's kingdom, and may trembling fall upon\r\n    the limbs of your enemies! Amen.\r\n\r\n    Write to me soon, and send the letter to the capital. Please write\r\n    in Arabic characters, so that I may be able to read your letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From_, GENERAL KAUFFMANN _to the_ AMIR OF AFGHANISTAN, _dated 30th\r\nZekada (=26th November,_ 1878).\r\n\r\n    (After compliments.) I was much pleased to receive your letter,\r\n    dated 24th Zekada, 1295 (=18th November, 1878), and to hear of\r\n    your good health. I have also received a copy of the letter which\r\n    you sent to the Governor-General. May God be pleased with you. The\r\n    British Ministers have given a pledge to our Ambassador in London\r\n    that they will not interfere with the independence of Afghanistan.\r\n    I am directed by His Majesty the Emperor to communicate this news\r\n    to you, and then, after forming friendship, to go to His Majesty.\r\n    I intend to go to the Russian capital after I have arranged the\r\n    affairs of this country (Turkestan). As I do not consider it\r\n    advisable to keep your trusted officials, whom you are in want\r\n    of, here any more, I send Mahomed Hassan Khan, Kamuah\r\n    (Deputy-Governor), and Gholam Haidar Khan, with two officers, back\r\n    to you. I hope you will consider me a well-wisher of your kingdom,\r\n    and write to me now and then. I have given instructions that,\r\n    until my return, every letter of yours which they receive at\r\n    Turkestan should be forwarded to the capital. Your good fortune is\r\n    a cause of happiness to me, and if any troubles come upon you, I\r\n    also shall be grieved. Some presents have been sent by me through\r\n    Mirza Mahomed Hassan, Kamuah; perhaps they may be accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Translation of a letter from,_ GENERAL KAUFFMANN _to_ GENERAL\r\nVOZGONOFF, _dated Zel Hijja,_ 1295 _(=December,_ 1878).\r\n\r\n    The Amir knows perfectly well that it is impossible for me to\r\n    assist him with troops in winter. Therefore it is necessary that\r\n    war should not be commenced at this unseasonable time. If the\r\n    English, in spite of the Amir's exertions to avoid the war,\r\n    commence it, you must then take leave of the Amir and start for\r\n    Tashkent, because your presence in Afghanistan in winter is\r\n    useless. Moreover, at such a juncture as the commencement of war\r\n    in Afghanistan, you ought to come here and explain the whole thing\r\n    to me, so that I may communicate it to the Emperor. This will be\r\n    of great benefit to Afghanistan and to Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From_ GENERAL KAUFFMANN _to the_ AMIR OF AFGHANISTAN, dated _25th\r\nDecember,_ 1878 _(Russian, 13th Muharram,_ 1296).\r\n\r\n    Your letter, dated 27th Zel Hijja (=20th November), 1878, has\r\n    reached me. I was pleased to hear tidings of your good health.\r\n    The Emperor has caused the British Government to agree to the\r\n    continuance of Afghan independence. The English Ministers have\r\n    promised this. I earnestly request you not to leave your kingdom.\r\n    As far as possible, consider your own interests, and do not lose\r\n    your independence. For the present come to terms with the British\r\n    Government. If you do not want to go back to Kabul for this\r\n    purpose, you can write to your son, Mahomed Yakub Khan, to make\r\n    peace with the English as you may direct him. Do not leave the\r\n    soil of Afghanistan at this time, because it will be of benefit\r\n    to you. My words are not without truth, because your arrival in\r\n    Russian territory will make things worse.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX VII (cont.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_From_ GENERAL KAUFFMANN _to the_ AMIR OF AFGHANISTAN, _received at\r\nMazir-i-Sharif on the 17th January, 1879_.\r\n\r\n    I have received your friendly letter, dated 13th Zel Hijja (=8th\r\n    December, 1878).

The Russian Government engages that if any foreign enemy attacks\r\nAfghanistan, and the Amir is unable to drive him out, and asks the\r\nassistance of the Russian Government, the Russian Government will\r\nrepel the enemy, either by means of advice, or by such other means as\r\nit may consider proper.\r\n\r\n4. The Amir of Afghanistan will not wage war with any foreign power\r\nwithout consulting the Russian Government, and without its permission.\r\n\r\n5. The Amir of Afghanistan engages that he will always report in a\r\nfriendly manner to the Russian Government what goes on in his kingdom.\r\n\r\n6. The Amir of Afghanistan will communicate every wish and important\r\naffair of his to General Kauffmann, Governor-General of Turkestan, and\r\nthe Governor-General will be authorized by the Russian Government to\r\nfulfil the wishes of the Amir.\r\n\r\n7. The Russian Government engages that the Afghan merchants who may\r\ntrade and sojourn in Russian territory will be safe from wrong, and\r\nthat they will be allowed to carry away their profits.\r\n\r\n8. The Amir of Afghanistan will have the power to send his servants to\r\nRussia to learn arts and trades, and the Russian officers will treat\r\nthem with consideration and respect as men of rank.\r\n\r\n9.

In\r\n    a spirit of justice and friendship you wrote to inquire what I\r\n    wished in Afghanistan. My honoured friend, the servants of the\r\n    great [British] Government know well that, throughout these twelve\r\n    years of exile in the territories of the Emperor of Russia, night\r\n    and day I have cherished the hope of revisiting my native land.\r\n    When the late Amir Sher Ali Khan died, and there was no one to\r\n    rule our tribes, I proposed to return to Afghanistan, but it\r\n    was not fated [that I should do so]; then I went to Tashkent.\r\n    Consequently, Amir Mahomed Yakub Khan, having come to terms and\r\n    made peace with the British Government, was appointed Amir of\r\n    Afghanistan; but since, after he had left you, he listened to the\r\n    advice of every interested [dishonest] person, and raised fools to\r\n    power, until the ignorant men directed the affairs of Afghanistan,\r\n    which during the reign of my grandfather, who had eighteen able\r\n    sons, was so managed that night was bright like day, Afghanistan\r\n    was, in consequence, disgraced before all States, and ruined. Now,\r\n    therefore, that you seek to learn my hopes and wishes, they are\r\n    these: that as long as your Empire and that of Russia exist, my\r\n    countrymen, the tribes of Afghanistan, should live quietly in ease\r\n    and peace; that these two States should find us true and faithful,\r\n    and that we should rest at peace between them [England and\r\n    Russia], for my tribesmen are unable to struggle with Empires, and\r\n    are ruined by want of commerce; and we hope of your friendship\r\n    that, sympathizing with and assisting the people of Afghanistan,\r\n    you will place them under the honourable protection of the two\r\n    Powers. This would redound to the credit of both, would give peace\r\n    to Afghanistan, and quiet and comfort to God's people. This is my\r\n    wish; for the rest, it is yours to decide.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX IX.\r\n\r\n(Referred to in Chapter LVIII, Footnote 6.)\r\n\r\n_Letter from A. C. LYALL, ESQ., C.B., Secretary to the Government of\r\nIndia, Foreign Department, to LEPEL H. GRIFFIN, Esq., C.S.I., Chief\r\nPolitical Officer, Kabul, dated Simla, April, 1880._\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have the honour to inform you that the Governor-General has\r\n    received and considered in council your telegrams of the 22nd and\r\n    23rd instant, forwarding the translation of a letter received by\r\n    you from Sirdar Abdur Rahman on the 21st instant, together with\r\n    a summary of certain oral explanations which accompanied that\r\n    letter, and a statement of the recommendations suggested by it to\r\n    Lieutenaut-General Sir Frederick Roberts and yourself.\r\n\r\n    In conveying to you its instructions on the subject of this\r\n    important communication, the Government of India considers it\r\n    expedient to recapitulate the principles on which it has hitherto\r\n    been acting in northern Afghanistan, and clearly to define the\r\n    point of view from which it contemplates the present situation of\r\n    affairs in that country. The single object to which, as you are\r\n    well aware, the Afghan policy of this Government has at all times\r\n    been directed and limited, is the security of the North-West\r\n    frontier of India. The Government of India has, however, no less\r\n    invariably held and acted on the conviction that the security of\r\n    this frontier is incompatible with the intrusion of any foreign\r\n    influence into the great border State of Afghanistan. To exclude\r\n    or eject such influence the Government of India has frequently\r\n    subsidized and otherwise assisted the Amirs of Kabul. It has also,\r\n    more than once, taken up arms against them. But it has never\r\n    interfered, for any other purpose, in the affairs of their\r\n    kingdom. Regulating on this principle and limiting to this object\r\n    the conduct of our relations with the rulers of Kabul, it was our\r\n    long-continued endeavour to find in their friendship and their\r\n    strength the requisite guarantees for the security of our own\r\n    frontier. Failing in that endeavour, we were compelled to seek the\r\n    attainment of the object to which our Afghan policy was, and is\r\n    still, exclusively directed, by rendering the permanent security\r\n    of our frontier as much as possible independent of such\r\n    conditions.\r\n\r\n    This obligation was not accepted without reluctance. Not even when\r\n    forced into hostilities by the late Amir Sher Ali Khan's espousal\r\n    of a Russian alliance, proposed by Russia in contemplation of a\r\n    rupture with the British Government, did we relinquish our desire\r\n    for the renewal of relations with a strong and friendly Afghan\r\n    Power, and, when the son of Sher Ali subsequently sought our\r\n    alliance and protection, they were at once accorded to him, on\r\n    conditions of which His Highness professed to appreciate the\r\n    generosity. The crime, however, which dissolved the Treaty of\r\n    Gandamak, and the disclosures which followed that event, finally\r\n    convinced the Government of India that the interests committed to\r\n    its care could not but be gravely imperilled by further adhesion\r\n    to a policy dependent for its fruition on the gratitude, the good\r\n    faith, the assumed self-interest, or the personal character of any\r\n    Afghan Prince.\r\n\r\n    When, therefore, Her Majesty's troops re-entered Afghanistan in\r\n    September last, it was with two well-defined and plainly-avowed\r\n    objects. The first was to avenge the treacherous massacre of\r\n    the British Mission at Kabul; the second was to maintain the\r\n    safeguards sought through the Treaty of Gandamak, by providing\r\n    for their maintenance guarantees of a more substantial and less\r\n    precarious character.\r\n\r\n    These two objects have been maintained: the first by the capture\r\n    of Kabul and the punishment of the crime committed there, the\r\n    second by the severance of Kandahar from the Kabul power.\r\n\r\n    Satisfied with their attainment, the Government of India has no\r\n    longer any motive or desire to enter into fresh treaty engagements\r\n    with the Rulers of Kabul. The arrangements and exchange of\r\n    friendly assurances with the Amir Sher Ali, though supplemented on\r\n    the part of the Government of India by subsidies and favours of\r\n    various kinds, wholly failed to secure the object of them,\r\n    which was, nevertheless, a thoroughly friendly one, and no less\r\n    conducive to the security and advantage of the Afghan than to\r\n    those of the British Power. The treaty with Yakub Khan, which\r\n    secured to him our friendship and material support, was equally\r\n    ineffectual. Moreover, recent events and arrangements have\r\n    fundamentally changed the situation to which our correspondence\r\n    and engagements with the Amir of Afghanistan formally applied. Our\r\n    advance frontier positions at Kandahar and Kuram have materially\r\n    diminished the political importance of Kabul in relation to India,\r\n    and although we shall always appreciate the friendship of its\r\n    Ruler, our relations with him are now of so little importance to\r\n    the paramount objects of our policy that we no longer require to\r\n    maintain British agents in any part of his dominions.\r\n\r\n    Our only reasons, therefore, for not immediately withdrawing our\r\n    forces from northern Afghanistan have hitherto been--_first_, the\r\n    excited and unsettled condition of the country round Kabul,\r\n    with the attitude of hostility assumed by some leaders of armed\r\n    gatherings near Ghazni; and, _secondly_, the inability of the\r\n    Kabul Sirdars to agree among themselves on the selection of a\r\n    Ruler strong enough to maintain order after our evacuation of the\r\n    country.\r\n\r\n    The first-named of these reasons has now ceased to exist. In a\r\n    minute dated the 30th ultimo the Viceroy and Governor-General\r\n    stated that 'the Government is anxious to withdraw as soon as\r\n    possible the troops from Kabul and from all points beyond those\r\n    to be occupied under the Treaty of Gandamak, except Kandahar. In\r\n    order that this may be done, it is desirable to find a Ruler for\r\n    Kabul, which will be separated from Kandahar. Steps,' continued\r\n    His Excellency, 'are being taken for this purpose. Meanwhile, it\r\n    is essential that we should make such a display of strength in\r\n    Afghanistan as will show that we are masters of the situation,\r\n    and will overawe disaffection.'... 'All that is necessary, from a\r\n    political point of view, is for General Stewart to march to\r\n    Ghazni, break up any opposition he may find there or in the\r\n    neighbourhood, and open up direct communication with General Sir\r\n    Frederick Roberts at Kabul.' The military operations thus defined\r\n    have been accomplished by General Stewart's successful action\r\n    before Ghazni.\r\n\r\n    With regard to the second reason mentioned for the retention of\r\n    our troops in northern Afghanistan, the appearance of Abdur\r\n    Rahman as a candidate for the throne of Kabul, whose claims the\r\n    Government of India has no cause to oppose, and who seems to be\r\n    approved, and likely to be supported, by at least a majority of\r\n    the population, affords fair ground for anticipating that our\r\n    wishes in regard to the restoration, before our departure, of\r\n    order in that part of the country will now be fulfilled.\r\n\r\n    The Governor-General in Council has consequently decided that the\r\n    evacuation of Kabul shall be effected not later than October next,\r\n    and it is with special reference to this decision that the letter\r\n    and message addressed to you by Sirdar Abdur Rahman have been\r\n    carefully considered by His Excellency in Council.\r\n\r\n    What first claims notice in the consideration of that letter is\r\n    the desire that it expresses for the permanent establishment of\r\n    Afghanistan with our assistance and sympathy under the joint\r\n    protection of the British and Russian Empires. This suggestion,\r\n    which is more fully developed in the Sirdar's unwritten message,\r\n    cannot be entertained or discussed.\r\n\r\n    As already stated, the primary object and declared determination\r\n    of the Government of India have been the exclusion of foreign\r\n    influence or interference from Afghanistan. This cardinal\r\n    condition of amicable relations with Afghanistan has, at all times\r\n    and in all circumstances, been deemed essential for the permanent\r\n    security of Her Majesty's Indian Empire. As such, it has hitherto\r\n    been firmly maintained by successive Governors-General of India\r\n    under the explicit instructions of Her Majesty's Government. Nor\r\n    has it ever been ignored, or officially contested, by the Russian\r\n    Government. That Government, on the contrary, has repeatedly, and\r\n    under every recent change of circumstances in Afghanistan, renewed\r\n    the assurances solemnly given to the British Government that\r\n    'Russia considers Afghanistan as entirely beyond the sphere of her\r\n    influence.'\r\n\r\n    It is true that negotiations at one time passed between the two\r\n    Governments with a view to the mutual recognition of certain\r\n    territories as constituting a neutral zone between their\r\n    respective spheres of legitimate influence and action, and that at\r\n    one time it was proposed by Russia to treat Afghanistan itself as\r\n    a neutral territory. Those negotiations, however, having proved\r\n    fruitless, the northern frontier of Afghanistan was finally\r\n    determined by mutual agreement, and in 1876 the Russian Government\r\n    formally reiterated its adherence to the conclusion that, 'while\r\n    maintaining on either side the arrangement come to as regards the\r\n    limits of Afghanistan, which is to remain outside the sphere of\r\n    Russian action, the two Cabinets should regard as terminated the\r\n    discussions relative to the intermediate zone, which promised no\r\n    practical result.'\r\n\r\n    The position of Afghanistan as defined and settled by these\r\n    engagements was again distinctly affirmed on behalf of the Queen's\r\n    Government by the Marquis of Salisbury in 1879, and the Government\r\n    of India unreservedly maintains it in the fullest conviction\r\n    of its essential necessity for the peaceable protection of Her\r\n    Majesty's Indian dominions. It is therefore desirable that you\r\n    should take occasion to inform Abdur Rahman that the relations of\r\n    Afghanistan to the British and Russian Empires are matters which\r\n    the Government of India must decline to bring into discussion with\r\n    the Sirdar. The Afghan states and tribes are too contiguous\r\n    with India, whose North-Western frontier they surround, for the\r\n    Government of India ever willingly to accept partnership with\r\n    any other Power in the exercise of its legitimate and recognized\r\n    influence over those tribes and States.\r\n\r\n    The Governor-General in Council is, nevertheless, most anxious\r\n    that the Sirdar should not misunderstand the light in which his\r\n    personal sentiments and obligations towards Russia are regarded\r\n    by the Government of India. So long as the Rulers of Kabul were\r\n    amenable to its advice, this Government has never ceased to\r\n    impress on them the international duty of scrupulously respecting\r\n    all the recognized rights and interests of their Russian\r\n    neighbour, refraining from every act calculated to afford the\r\n    Russian authorities in Central Asia any just cause of umbrage or\r\n    complaint. The intelligence and good sense which are conspicuous\r\n    in the Sirdar's letter and messages to you will enable him to\r\n    appreciate the difference between conduct regulated on these\r\n    principles and that which cost Sher Ali the loss of his throne.\r\n    This Government does not desire, nor has it ever desired, to\r\n    impose on any Ruler of Kabul conditions incompatible with that\r\n    behaviour which Russia, as a powerful and neighbouring Empire, is\r\n    entitled to expect from him; least of all can we desire to impose\r\n    such conditions on a Prince who has received hospitality and\r\n    protection in Russian territory. I am therefore to observe that,\r\n    in the natural repugnance expressed by Abdur Rahman to conditions\r\n    which 'might make him appear ungrateful' to those 'whose salt he\r\n    has eaten,' the Governor-General in Council recognizes a sentiment\r\n    altogether honourable to the Sirdar, and perfectly consistent with\r\n    the sincerity of his professed goodwill towards ourselves.\r\n\r\n    These observations will furnish you with a sufficient answer to\r\n    the question asked by Abdur Rahman as to the 'nature of our\r\n    friendship' and 'its conditions.'\r\n\r\n    The frankness with which he has explained his position entitles\r\n    him to receive from us a no less unreserved statement of our own.\r\n    The Government of India cordially shares the wish expressed by\r\n    Abdur Rahman that, between the British and Russian Empires, his\r\n    'tribes and countrymen may live quietly in ease and peace.' We do\r\n    not desire to place them in a position of unfriendliness towards a\r\n    Power which is pledged to us to regard their country as 'entirely\r\n    beyond the sphere of its action.' The injury to Afghan commerce\r\n    caused by the present condition of Afghanistan, to which the\r\n    Sirdar has alluded, is fully appreciated by the Government of\r\n    India, and on the restoration of peace between the two countries\r\n    the revival and development of trade intercourse need present no\r\n    difficulty. As regards our own friendship, it will, if sincerely\r\n    sought, be freely given, and fully continued so long as it is\r\n    loyally reciprocated. But we attach to it no other condition. We\r\n    have no concessions to ask or make, and the Sirdar will therefore\r\n    perceive that there is really no matter for negotiation or bargain\r\n    between him and us.\r\n\r\n    On this point your reply to Abdur Rahman cannot be too explicit.\r\n    Previous to the Sirdar's arrival in Turkestan, the hostility and\r\n    treachery of those whose misconduct he admits and deplores had\r\n    compelled the Government of India to make territorial arrangements\r\n    of a material and permanent character for the better protection of\r\n    our frontier. The maintenance of these arrangements is in no wise\r\n    dependent on the assent or dissent, on the good will or ill-will,\r\n    of any Chief at Kabul. The character of them has been so fully\r\n    explained by you to all the other Kabul Sirdars that it is\r\n    probably well known to Abdur Rahman. But in order that our present\r\n    intercourse and future relations with the Sirdar may be perfectly\r\n    clear of doubt on a point affecting the position he aspires\r\n    to fill, the Governor-General in Council authorizes you, if\r\n    necessary, to make him plainly understand that neither the\r\n    district assigned to us by the Treaty of Gandamak, nor any part\r\n    of the province of Kandahar, will ever be restored to the Kabul\r\n    Power.\r\n\r\n    As regards this last-mentioned province, the Government of India\r\n    has been authorized by that of Her Majesty to give to Sher Ali\r\n    Khan, the present Wali of Kandahar, a distinct assurance that\r\n    he will be not only recognized, but maintained, by the British\r\n    Government as the Ruler of that province. Sher Ali Khan is one of\r\n    the Native nobles of Kandahar. He is administering the province\r\n    with ability, good sense, and complete loyalty to the British\r\n    Government, which has promised him the support of a British\r\n    garrison so long as he requires such support. The Governor-General\r\n    in Council cannot doubt that Sirdar Abdur Rahman will readily\r\n    recognize the obligation incumbent on the honour of the British\r\n    Government to keep faith with all who, whether at Kandahar or\r\n    elsewhere, have proved themselves true and loyal adherents.\r\n    Yakub Khan forfeited our alliance, and with it his throne, by\r\n    mistrusting the assurances we gave him, and falsifying those\r\n    which he had given to us. If, misled by his example, Yakub Khan's\r\n    successor attempts to injure or oppress the friends of the British\r\n    Government, its power will again be put forth to protect or avenge\r\n    them. Similarly, if the next Kabul Ruler reintroduces into his\r\n    Court or country foreign influences adverse to our own, the\r\n    Government of India will again take such steps as it may deem\r\n    expedient to deal with such a case. These contingencies, however,\r\n    cannot occur if the sentiments of Abdur Rahman are such as\r\n    he represents them to be. Meanwhile, the territorial and\r\n    administrative arrangements already completed by us for the\r\n    permanent protection of our own interests are not susceptible of\r\n    negotiation or discussion with Abdur Rahman or any other claimant\r\n    to the throne of Kabul.\r\n\r\n    To the settlement of Herat, which is not included in these\r\n    completed arrangements, the Governor-General in Council cannot\r\n    authorize you to make or invite any reference in your reply to\r\n    Abdur Rahman. The settlement of the future administration of\r\n    Herat has been undertaken by Her Majesty's Government; with those\r\n    present views in regard to this important question, the Government\r\n    of India is not yet acquainted.\r\n\r\n    Nor can our evacuation of Kabul constitute any subject for\r\n    proposals in your correspondence with the Sirdar. This measure\r\n    was determined on by the Government of India long before the\r\n    appearance of Abdur Rahman as a candidate for the government of\r\n    the country we are about to evacuate. It has not been caused by\r\n    the hostility, and is not, therefore, conditional on the goodwill,\r\n    of any Afghan Power.\r\n\r\n    The Government of India is, however, very willing to carry out the\r\n    evacuation of Kabul in the manner most conducive to the personal\r\n    advantage of Abdur Rahman, whose interests we believe to be, more\r\n    than those of any other Sirdar, in accordance with the general\r\n    interests of the Afghan people. For this reason it is desirable\r\n    that you should inform Abdur Rahman of our intention to evacuate\r\n    Kabul, and our desire to take that opportunity of unconditionally\r\n    transferring to his authority the whole of the country from which\r\n    our troops will be withdrawn. You are authorized to add that our\r\n    military and political officers at Kabul will be empowered to\r\n    facilitate any practical arrangement suggested by the Sirdar for\r\n    promptly and peaceably effecting, in co-operation with him, the\r\n    transfer thus contemplated on his behalf. Such arrangement must,\r\n    however, be consistent with our obligations towards those who have\r\n    served and aided the British Government during our occupation of\r\n    those territories.\r\n\r\n    For this purpose, it appears to the Governor-General in Council\r\n    desirable that the Sirdar should lose no time in proceeding to\r\n    Kabul, and there settling, in conference with General Stewart and\r\n    yourself, such preliminary arrangements as may best promote the\r\n    undisturbed establishment of his future government.\r\n\r\n    The Governor-General in Council has, however, no desire to press\r\n    this suggestion, should it appear to the Sirdar that his presence\r\n    at Kabul, previous to the withdrawal of our troops for the purpose\r\n    of personal conference with the British authorities, might have\r\n    the effect of weakening his popularity, or compromising his\r\n    position in the eyes of his future subjects.\r\n\r\n    The point is one which must be left entirely to the Sirdar's own\r\n    judgment and inclination.\r\n\r\n    But Abdur Rahman is doubtless aware that there are at present,\r\n    in and around Kabul, personages not destitute of influence, who\r\n    themselves aspire to the sovereignty he seeks, and that the family\r\n    of Yakub has still numerous personal adherents, who may possibly\r\n    take advantage of the withdrawal of our troops to oppose the\r\n    Sirdar's authority if he is not personally present to assert it.\r\n\r\n    It should on both sides he remembered and understood that it is\r\n    not the policy of this Government to impose upon the Afghan people\r\n    an unpopular Ruler or to interfere uninvited in the administration\r\n    of a friendly one. If Abdur Rahman proves able and disposed to\r\n    conciliate the confidence of his countrymen, without forfeiting\r\n    the good understanding which he seeks with us, he will assuredly\r\n    find his best support in our political appreciation of that fact.\r\n    Our reason for unconditionally transferring to him the government\r\n    of the country, from which our forces will in any case be\r\n    withdrawn a few months hence, is that, on the whole, he appears to\r\n    be the Chief best able to restore order in that country, and also\r\n    best entitled to undertake such a task. In his performance of it\r\n    he will receive, if he requires it, our assistance. But we neither\r\n    need nor wish to hamper, by preliminary stipulations or provisoes,\r\n    his independent exercise of a sovereignty which he declares\r\n    himself anxious to maintain on a footing of peace and friendship\r\n    with the British Government.\r\n\r\n    The present statement of the views and intentions of His\r\n    Excellency the Governor-General in Council respecting Abdur Rahman\r\n    will enable you to represent them with adequate accuracy in your\r\n    reply to the Sirdar's friendly overtures, and it will now be your\r\n    duty to convey to Abdur Rahman, without any avoidable delay,\r\n    the answer of the Government of India to the letter and message\r\n    received from him. His Excellency feels assured that you will give\r\n    full expression to the spirit of candour and goodwill in which\r\n    these communications have been received and are reciprocated.\r\n\r\n    But I am to impress on your attention the importance of avoiding\r\n    any expression which might appear to suggest or admit matter for\r\n    negotiation or discussion in reference to the relative positions\r\n    of the Sirdar and the Government of India.\r\n\r\n    In conclusion, I am to request that on receipt of this letter you\r\n    will be so good as to lose no time in submitting its contents to\r\n    General Sir Donald Stewart, should he then have reached Kabul.\r\n    In any case, you will, of course, communicate them to General\r\n    Roberts, and act upon them in consultation with the chief military\r\n    authority on the spot.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX X.\r\n\r\n(Referred to in Chapter LIX, Footnote 2.)\r\n\r\n_Extract from a Report by LIEUTENANT-GENERAL SIR FREDERICK ROBERTS,\r\nV.C., K.C.B., to the QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL IN INDIA, dated Kabul,\r\n17th April, 1880._\r\n\r\n25. I think I have now dealt with all the points of military\r\nimportance connected with the military position in northern\r\nAfghanistan, but there are a few questions of more general interest\r\nwhich I desire to bring to the notice of His Excellency the\r\nCommander-in-Chief and the Government of India.\r\n\r\n26. First with regard to rations. The daily scale of issue to Native\r\ntroops is given in the margin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Daily ration of Native soldiers_:\r\n\r\n  Atta[1]      12 chittacks [2]\r\n  Dall[3]       2 chittacks\r\n  Ghi[4]        1 chittack\r\n  Salt          1/3 chittack\r\n  Meat          1 lb. bi-weekly\r\n  Rum           1 dram  \"      ]\r\n\r\nIt has been found throughout the campaign, even when the men were\r\nemployed upon hard work, that '12 chittacks' of 'atta' daily are amply\r\nsufficient for the Native troops, supplemented, as of late, through\r\nthe liberality of Government, by a bi-weekly issue of 1 lb. of\r\nmeat. In a climate like Afghanistan, where the inhabitants are all\r\nmeat-eaters, this liberality has been most wise. Every endeavour was\r\nmade, before this sanction was granted, to supply the Native portion\r\nof the force with meat on payment, and I attribute to this in great\r\nmeasure the sound health and excellent stamina which they now exhibit.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the issue of rum, I would suggest that it should not be\r\nissued free to Native troops, except under exceptional circumstances\r\nof fatigue and weather, but that the Commissariat Department should\r\nbe authorized to have in store a sufficiency of rum to admit of a\r\nbi-weekly issue to such troops as drink the spirit, _on payment_, and\r\nthen only on the recommendation of the Medical Officer, and under the\r\nsanction of the General Officer commanding. On all occasions when rum\r\nis sanctioned, either free or on payment, those who do not partake\r\nof spirits should he allowed a ration of tea and sugar under similar\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n27. The scale of rations for Native followers requires no alteration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Daily ration of European soldiers_:\r\n\r\n  Meat             1-1/4 lb.\r\n  Bread            1-1/4 lb.\r\n  Vegetables       1-1/4 lb.\r\n  Rice                 4 oz.\r\n  Salt               2/3 oz.\r\n  Tea                3/4 oz.\r\n  Sugar                3 oz.\r\n  Rum                  1 dr.]\r\n\r\n28. The European rations now under issue in Kabul are as per margin,\r\nand with reference to them I would make the following remarks:\r\nThe increase of 1/4 lb. in bread and meat is, in my opinion, very\r\ndesirable, for not only is the meat, as a rule, on service inferior to\r\nthat served in cantonments, but the extras which can be procured from\r\nthe coffee-shop are not here forthcoming. When the vegetable ration\r\nconsists of potatoes, 1 lb. is sufficient, but when it is made of\r\nmixed vegetables 1-1/4 lb. is necessary. The substitution of _dall_\r\nfor any portion of the vegetable ration I consider undesirable.\r\n\r\nTinned soups and meats and biscuits are most valuable, and should be\r\nliberally supplied to every force in the field. They are portable and\r\nliked by the men, to whom they furnish a very welcome change of diet.\r\nI would very strongly recommend that a much larger issue of these\r\narticles than has hitherto been sanctioned should be provided.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Firewood.]\r\n\r\n29. A question which has arisen during this campaign, and which may\r\ncrop up again, has been the provision of firewood for cooking to\r\nNative troops and followers. Throughout the winter firewood could not\r\nbe purchased at Kabul, and it was absolutely necessary to issue it to\r\nthese men. This was done at the rate of one _seer_[5] per man, but\r\nthis amount is not arbitrary, and might, under certain circumstances,\r\nbe diminished. Since roads were re-opened and markets re-established\r\nthe issue of wood has been discontinued. In framing any future rules\r\nfor the guidance of a force in the field, the question of providing\r\nfirewood through the Commissariat Department for Native troops and\r\nfollowers, free or on payment, should be vested in the General\r\nOfficers commanding.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shoes.]\r\n\r\n30. The scale of clothing authorized by Government for Native troops\r\nand followers was found, even in the rigorous climate of Afghanistan,\r\nto be most liberal, except that during the very coldest weather a\r\nsecond blanket was required. This want I was able to meet from stock\r\nin hand, and as the weather became milder these extra blankets were\r\nwithdrawn and returned into store. Warm stockings, too, are very\r\nnecessary in a climate where frostbite is not uncommon; fortunately,\r\nsome thousands were procured locally and issued to followers. The\r\nordinary Native shoe of India, as provided by the Commissariat\r\nDepartment, is utterly unfitted for a country such as Afghanistan.\r\nMajor Badcock will send to Peshawar (where they can easily be made up)\r\na pattern Kabali shoe, which I am convinced would be found admirably\r\nsuited for Native troops and followers crossing the frontier. We are\r\nnow almost entirely dependent on the local market for our shoes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ammunition boots.]\r\n\r\nA large supply of English-made ammunition boots should always\r\naccompany a force in the field, in order to allow those Natives who\r\nuse them, and who are often crippled by wearing other descriptions of\r\nshoe, to obtain them on payment at the moderate rate now fixed, viz.,\r\nRs. 4 per pair.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Waterproof sheets.]\r\n\r\nThe country-made waterproof sheets, though slightly heavier, have\r\nproved themselves quite as serviceable, if not more so, than the\r\nEnglish-made ones.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the campaign, I would very strongly recommend that an\r\nintelligent committee should be required to go thoroughly into\r\nthese questions of clothing for troops, British and Native, and for\r\nfollowers. I would also suggest that when a decision is arrived at,\r\nsealed patterns of every article approved should be deposited at all\r\nmanufacturing centres and in all the large jails, so that when certain\r\narticles are required they need only be called for, and precious time\r\n(often wasted in reference and correspondence) saved.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Doolie-bearers.]\r\n\r\n31. The number of doolie-bearers with the two divisions of the Kabul\r\nField Force now at Kabul is 3,536, with the very moderate sick report\r\nof 35, or 1 per cent. of strength.\r\n\r\n  Doolies and dandies are distributed as follows:\r\n\r\n  British troops         {doolies, 3 per cent.\r\n                         {dandies, 2 per cent.\r\n\r\n  Native troops          {doolies, 2 per cent.\r\n                         {dandies, 3 per cent.\r\n\r\n--a percentage which I consider sufficient for field-service, as, in\r\nthe event of any unusual number of casualties, transport animals could\r\nand would be made use of, and it is most undesirable to increase the\r\nnumber of followers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Lushai dandy.]\r\n\r\nThe Lushai dandy for this sort of warfare is much preferable to the\r\ncarpet or dhurrie dandy, as it can be made into a bed, and men are not\r\nso liable to fall out of it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bourke's doolie.]\r\n\r\nBourke's doolie is very good, but liable to get out of order, and\r\ndifficult to repair when broken; the ordinary kind is fairly good and\r\nserviceable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Field-service tents.]\r\n\r\n32. I would urge that in future all field-service tents should be\r\nmade after the pattern of the Mountain Battery tent, single fly\r\nfor Natives, double for Europeans, and that the poles should be\r\nconstructed on the telescopic principle: that is, that no thinning\r\nof the wood where it enters the socket should be allowed either on\r\nuprights or ridge-pole, and that the old system of paring away should\r\nbe abandoned. Instead, the upper section should sit flat on the lower.\r\nDoubtless the sockets will have to be longer and stronger than those\r\nnow in use, but this is the only means by which tents can be adapted\r\nto mule and pony carriage, which will no doubt in future wars be our\r\nchief means of transport.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Waler horses.]\r\n\r\n33. The Waler horses of the Cavalry and Artillery have stood the\r\nstrain remarkably well, considering the hard work and great exposure\r\nthey have had to bear, and also that for a considerable time they were\r\nentirely deprived of green food. I feel sure this information will\r\nbe most satisfactory, seeing that, for the future, the Artillery and\r\nCavalry in India must mainly depend upon the Australian market for\r\ntheir remounts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Committee to record suggestions on equipment.]\r\n\r\n34. As there are some minor points of detail which might\r\nadvantageously be considered by those who have had the experience of\r\nrecent service, I have convened a committee, with Colonel MacGregor,\r\nC.B., as President, which will take suggestions and record opinions\r\nregarding packing transport animals, equipment, kit, dress, etc., of\r\nboth officers and men of the several branches of the service. From\r\nthe constitution of the committee, I feel certain that their\r\nrecommendations cannot but be valuable, and I hope to have the honour\r\nof submitting them shortly for the consideration of His Excellency the\r\nCommander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Flour.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: A chittack = 2 ounces.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: A kind of pea.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Clarified butter.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: A seer = 2 lb.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XI. (Referred to in Chapter LXVI, Footnote 3.)\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR THE GUIDANCE OF GENERAL AND OTHER OFFICERS COMMANDING\r\nCOLUMNS IN BURMA.\r\n\r\nMANDALAY, _20th. November, 1886._\r\n\r\nThe following general instructions for the guidance of\r\nBrigadier-Generals and Officers in command of columns are published by\r\norder of His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief in India:\r\n\r\n_1st_.--Columns sent out for the pacification of a district, or in\r\npursuit of a particular gang of dacoits, must be amply provided and\r\nable to keep the field for ten days at least. To enable this to be\r\ndone without employing an undue number of transport animals, it is\r\nnecessary that every endeavour be made to obtain grain for Cavalry\r\nhorses and Transport ponies from the villages passed through; careful\r\ninquiry must be made as to where supplies can be obtained locally, and\r\nthe line of advance determined accordingly. Arrangements must be made\r\nfor replenishing the supply when necessary from depots which must be\r\nformed at convenient centres when the nature of the operations may\r\nnecessitate it. These depots should be pushed forward from time to\r\ntime as the troops advance. The work of a column obliged to return to\r\nits base of supply before it has had an opportunity of completing the\r\nobject of the expedition must be more harmful than beneficial, as its\r\nfailure emboldens the enemy and weakens the confidence of the people\r\nin our power to protect them and to reach the offenders.\r\n\r\n_2nd_.--Where two or more columns are acting in concert, the details\r\nof time and place of movement should be settled beforehand with the\r\ngreatest nicety, and the commanding officers of all such columns\r\nshould be provided with the same maps, or tracings from them, so that\r\nsubsequent changes of plan, rendered necessary by later information,\r\nmay be understood and conformed to by all. Officers commanding columns\r\nmust do their utmost to get into, and keep up, communication with one\r\nanother. This can be effected by:\r\n\r\n  Visual signalling,\r\n  Spies and scouts,\r\n  Patrolling.\r\n\r\n_3rd_.--Movements to be executed in concert with the troops in other\r\nbrigades or commands, or likely to tell directly or indirectly on the\r\ndistricts commanded by other officers, will be fully communicated to\r\nthose officers, both beforehand and when in progress.\r\n\r\n_4th_.--Brigadier-Generals are empowered to give very liberal\r\nremuneration for the effective service of guides and for information\r\ninvolving danger to those who give it. They may delegate this power to\r\nselected officers in detached commands, but a close watch must be kept\r\non expenditure under this head. Opportunities should be afforded to\r\ntimid informers who are afraid to compromise themselves by entering\r\ncamp to interview officers at some distance out and in secrecy.\r\n\r\n_5th_.--Cavalry horses and Mounted Infantry ponies must be saved as\r\nmuch as is compatible with occasional forced and rapid marches. On\r\nordinary occasions the riders should dismount, from time to time, and\r\nmarch alongside of their horses or ponies.\r\n\r\n_6th_.--The special attention of all officers is called to the careful\r\ntreatment of pack-animals, and officers in command of columns and\r\nparties will be held strictly responsible that the animals are\r\nproperly loaded for the march, saved as much as possible during it,\r\nand carefully attended to and fed after it. Officers in command will\r\nascertain by daily personal supervision and inspection that these\r\norders are carried out.\r\n\r\n_7th_.--It must be remembered that the chief object of traversing\r\nthe country with columns is to cultivate friendly relations with the\r\ninhabitants, and at the same time to put before them evidences of\r\nour power, thus gaining their good-will and their confidence. It is\r\ntherefore the bounden duty of commanding officers to ascertain that\r\nthe troops under their command are not permitted to injure the\r\nproperty of the people or to wound their susceptibilities.\r\n\r\n_8th_.--The most injurious accounts of our intentions have been\r\ncirculated amongst, and believed by, the people, and too much pains\r\ncannot be taken to eradicate this impression, and to assure the people\r\nboth by act and word of our good-will towards the law-abiding. Chief\r\nmen of districts should he treated with consideration and distinction.\r\nThe success of the present operations will much depend on the tact\r\nwith which the inhabitants are treated.\r\n\r\n_9th_.--When there is an enemy in arms against British rule, all\r\narrangements must be made not only to drive him from his position,\r\nbut also to surround the position so as to inflict the heaviest loss\r\npossible. Resistance overcome without inflicting punishment on the\r\nenemy only emboldens him to repeat the game, and thus, by protracting\r\noperations, costs more lives than a severe lesson promptly\r\nadministered, even though that lesson may cause some casualties on\r\nour side. Arrangements should be made to surround villages and jungle\r\nretreats with Cavalry, and afterwards to hunt them closely with\r\nInfantry. In the pursuit the broadest margin possible will be drawn\r\nbetween leaders of rebellion and the professional dacoit on the one\r\npart, and the villagers who have been forced into combinations against\r\nus. _Bohs_ and leaders will generally be found heading the column of\r\nfugitives, and a portion of the Cavalry should be directed to pursue\r\nthem without wasting time over the rank and file of the enemy.\r\n\r\n_10th_.--Unless otherwise ordered, columns of occupation should move\r\nin short marches, halting at the principal towns and villages. This\r\nwill give civil officers opportunities for becoming thoroughly\r\nacquainted with their districts, and give military officers time to\r\nreconnoitre and sketch the country.\r\n\r\n_11th_.--Where troops are likely to be quartered for some time, bamboo\r\nplatforms should be erected to keep the men off the ground. Tents, if\r\nafterwards provided, can be pitched on the platforms.\r\n\r\n_12th_.--The greatest latitude will be allowed to Brigadier-Generals\r\nand officers in local command in ordering and carrying out movements\r\nfor the pacification of their districts. They will, however, report as\r\nfully as possible all movements intended and in progress, through\r\nthe regular channel, for the information of His Excellency the\r\nCommander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n_13th_.--Civil officers will be detailed under the orders of the Chief\r\nCommissioner to accompany columns. As they are in a position to reward\r\nloyalty and good service, they will be able to obtain more reliable\r\nguides and intelligence than the military officers can hope to get.\r\nThe Chief Commissioner has authorized selected Burmans, men of\r\nposition who may look for official appointments, being employed as\r\nscouts by the civil officers of districts and being attached to\r\ncolumns. These scouts should wear some distinguishing and conspicuous\r\nmark or badge to prevent them being fired on by the troops. They\r\nshould not be called upon to take the front when approaching an\r\nunbroken enemy, or where ambuscades may be expected, but their\r\nservices will be most valuable in gaining information, and later in\r\nhunting down the individuals of a broken-up gang.\r\n\r\n_14th_.--Absolute secrecy must be maintained regarding movements\r\nagainst the enemy and every device resorted to to mislead him.\r\n\r\n_15th_.--When civil officers accompany columns, all prisoners will be\r\nhanded over to them for disposal. When no civil officer is present,\r\nthe officer commanding the column will, _ex officio_, have magisterial\r\npowers to inflict punishment up to two years' imprisonment, or 30\r\nlashes. Offenders deserving heavier punishment must be reserved for\r\ndisposal by the civil officers.\r\n\r\n_16th_.--Officers commanding columns will be held responsible that the\r\ntroops are not kept in unhealthy districts, and that, when a locality\r\nhas proved itself unhealthy, the troops are removed at the earliest\r\npossible opportunity. Military officers are responsible for the\r\nlocation of the troops. The requisitions of civil officers will be\r\ncomplied with, whenever practicable, but military officers are to\r\njudge in all matters involving the military or sanitary suitability of\r\na position.\r\n\r\n_17th_.--In the class of warfare in which we are now engaged, where\r\nnight surprises and ambuscades are the only formidable tactics of the\r\nenemy, the greatest care must be taken to ensure the safety of the\r\ncamp at night. To meet ambuscades, which usually take the form of a\r\nvolley followed by flight, and which, in very dense jungle, it may\r\nbe impossible to discover or guard against by means of flankers, His\r\nExcellency the Commander-in-Chief would wish the following plan to be\r\ntried: Supposing, for instance, the fire of the enemy to be delivered\r\nfrom the right, a portion of the force in front should be ready to\r\ndash along the road for 100 yards, or so, or until some opening in\r\nthe jungle offers itself. The party should then turn to the right and\r\nsweep round with a view to intercepting the enemy in his flight. A\r\nparty in rear should similarly enter the jungle to their right with\r\nthe same object. The centre of the column would hold the ground and\r\nprotect the baggage or any wounded men. The different parties must be\r\npreviously told off, put under the command of selected leaders, and\r\nmust act with promptitude and dash. Each party must be kept in compact\r\norder, and individual firing must be prohibited, except when there is\r\na clear prospect. Past experience suggests the adoption of some such\r\nplan as the above, but in guerilla warfare officers must suit their\r\ntactics to the peculiar and ever-varying circumstances in which they\r\nmay find themselves engaged.\r\n\r\n_18th_.--The Government have ordered a general disarmament of the\r\ncountry, as soon as the large bands of rebels and dacoits are\r\ndispersed. The orders for this disarmament direct that all firearms\r\nare to be taken from the people, but that a moderate number may be\r\nreturned to responsible villagers who are loyal and are able to\r\ndefend themselves. No firearms will be returned save under registered\r\nlicenses; and licenses will be given only for villages which can\r\nproduce a certain number (5 to 10) guns, and are either stockaded or\r\nfenced against sudden attack. The duty of disarming lies on civil\r\nofficers and the police; but as it is desirable that the disarmament\r\nshould be effected as quickly as possible, officers commanding posts\r\nand columns will give such assistance as may be in their power in\r\ncarrying it out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XII.\r\n\r\n(Referred to in Chapter LXVIII, Note *.)\r\n\r\n_To His EXCELLENCY THE RIGHT HONOURABLE FREDERICK BARON ROBERTS\r\nOF KANDAHAR AND WATERFORD, BART., V.C., G.C.B., G.C.I.E., R.A.,\r\nCommander-in-Chief of Her Majesty's Forces in India._\r\n\r\nMAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY,\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, representing the Sikhs of the Punjab, most\r\nrespectfully beg to approach Your Excellency with this humble address\r\nof farewell on Your Lordship's approaching departure from this\r\ncountry. We cannot give adequate expression to the various ideas which\r\nare agitating our minds at this juncture, relating as they do to the\r\npast, present, and future, making us feel, at one and the same time,\r\ngrateful, happy, and sorrowful. The success which Your Excellency has\r\nachieved in Asia is such as makes India and England proud of it. The\r\nhistory of the British Empire in India has not, at least for the last\r\nthirty years, produced a hero like Your Lordship, whose soldier-like\r\nqualities are fully known to the world. The country which had been the\r\ncradle of Indian invasions came to realize the extent of your power\r\nand recognized your generalship. The victories gained by Sale, Nott,\r\nand Pollock in the plains of Afghanistan have been shadowed by those\r\ngained by Your Excellency. The occupation of Kabul and the glorious\r\nbattle of Kandahar are among the brightest jewels in the diadem of\r\nYour Lordship's Baronage. Your Excellency's achievements checked\r\nthe aggressive advance of the Great Northern Bear, whose ambitious\r\nprogress received a check from the roar of a lion in the person of\r\nYour Lordship; and a zone of neutral ground has now been fixed, and a\r\nline of peace marked by the Boundary Commission. The strong defences\r\nwhich Your Excellency has provided on the frontier add another bright\r\nstone to the building of your fame, and constitute in themselves a\r\nlasting memorial of Your Excellency's martial skill. Never had any\r\nBritish General to face more arduous tasks, and none has proved more\r\ncompletely successful in overcoming them than Your Lordship. The\r\nresult is that India has been rendered safe from the fear of invasion\r\nfrom without. Your Excellency is not only adorned with heroic\r\nqualifications, but the love and affection with which the people of\r\nIndia regard Your Lordship show what admirable qualities are exhibited\r\nin the person of Your Excellency. Terrible in war and merciful in\r\npeace, Your Excellency's name has become a dread to the enemies of\r\nEngland and lovely to your friends. The interest which Your Lordship\r\nhas always taken in the welfare of those with whom you have worked in\r\nIndia is well known to everybody. The Sikhs in particular are, more\r\nthan any other community in India, indebted to Your Lordship. We find\r\nin Your Excellency a true friend of the Sikh community--a community\r\nwhich is always devoted heart and soul to the service of Her Most\r\nGracious Majesty the Empress of India. No one understands better than\r\nYour Excellency the value of a Sikh soldier, and we feel very grateful\r\nthat the military authorities recognize the necessity of requiring\r\nevery Sikh recruit to be baptized according to the Sikh religion\r\nbefore admission to the Army--a practice which makes the Sikhs more\r\ntrue and faithful, and which preserves the existence of a very\r\nuseful community. The Sikhs are said to be born soldiers, but\r\nthey undoubtedly make very good citizens in time of peace also.\r\nUnfortunately, however, they have had no opportunity of fully\r\ndeveloping their mental powers, so as to enable them to advance with\r\nthe spirit of the age. We thank God that Your Excellency was among\r\nthose who most desired to see the Sikhs refined and educated by\r\nestablishing a Central College in the Punjab for the use of the Sikh\r\npeople, and we confidently hope that the Sikhs, of whom a large\r\nportion is under Your Excellency's command, will give their mite in\r\nsupport of this national seminary. The subscriptions given by Your\r\nLordship, His Excellency the Viceroy, and His Honour the late\r\nLieutenant-Governor, were very valuable to the Institution, and the\r\nSikhs are highly gratified by the honour Your Excellency has lately\r\ngiven to the Khalsa Diwan by becoming its honorary patron. In\r\nconclusion, we beg only to repeat that it is quite beyond our power to\r\nstate how much we are indebted to Your Excellency, and how much we are\r\naffected by the news that Your Lordship will shortly leave this land.\r\nThe very idea of our separation from the direct contact of so strong\r\nand affectionate a leader, as Your Excellency undoubtedly is, makes us\r\nfeel very sorrowful; but as our hearts and prayers will always be with\r\nyou and Lady Roberts, we shall be consoled if Your Excellency would\r\nonly keep us in your memory, and on arrival in England assure Her Most\r\nGracious Majesty, the Mother-Empress, that all Sikhs, whether high or\r\nlow, strong or weak, old or young, are heartily devoted to her Crown\r\nand her representatives in this country. Before retiring, we thank\r\nYour Excellency for the very great honour that has been done to the\r\npeople of Lahore by Your Lordship's visit to this city.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XIII.\r\n\r\n(Referred to in Chapter LXVIII, Note *.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_To HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL THE RIGHT HONOURABLE FREDERICK BARON\r\nROBERTS OF KANDAHAR AND WATERFORD, BART., V.C., G.C.B., G.C.I.E.,\r\nR.A., Commander-in-Chief of Her Majesty's Forces in India._\r\n\r\nMAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY,\r\n\r\nWe are proud to stand in Your Lordship's presence to-day on behalf of\r\nthe Hindus of the Punjab, the loyal subjects of the Queen-Empress, who\r\nappreciate the countless blessings which British Rule has conferred\r\nupon this country, to give expression to the feelings of gratitude\r\nwhich are uppermost in their hearts. We feel it really an honour that\r\nwe are able to show our appreciation of British Rule in the presence\r\nof the eminent soldier and statesman who has taken an important\r\npart in making the India of to-day what it is--contented within\r\nand strengthened against aggression from abroad. The Punjab is\r\nthe province where the military strength of the Empire is being\r\nconcentrated, and the bravery of the warlike races inhabiting it,\r\nwhich furnish the flower of Her Gracious Majesty's forces of the Army\r\nin India, has been conspicuously displayed on several occasions during\r\nthe last thirty years. We Hindus have availed ourselves the most of\r\nthe facilities which British Rule has provided for the progress of the\r\npeople in commercial enterprise, educational advance, and political\r\nprogress. We are, therefore, all the more proud that we have been\r\nallowed to-day to greet in person the mighty soldier, the sympathetic\r\nCommander, and the sagacious Statesman, the record of whose\r\ndistinguished career in the East is virtually the history of nearly\r\nhalf a century of glorious victories--victories both of peace and\r\nwar--achieved by the British Power in Asia, to show how intense is\r\nour gratitude towards the Queen-Empress and one of her eminent\r\nrepresentatives in India, who have striven to do their duty by the\r\npeople of this country, and done it to the satisfaction of the people\r\nand of their Gracious Sovereign. The interests of India and England\r\nare identical, and the Hindus of the Punjab regard British Rule as a\r\nProvidential gift to this country--an agency sent to raise the people\r\nin the scale of civilization. Anything that is done to guarantee\r\nthe continuance of the present profoundly peaceful condition of the\r\ncountry is highly appreciated by us, and we are, therefore, all the\r\nmore grateful to Your Lordship for all that your courage, foresight,\r\nsagacity, and high statesmanship have been able to achieve. At a time\r\nwhen all the races and communities inhabiting this frontier province,\r\nwhich has been truly described as the sword-hand in India, are vying\r\nwith each other in showing their high appreciation of the good work\r\ndone by Your Excellency, of which not the least significant proof lies\r\nin the arrangement for the defence of the country at all vulnerable\r\npoints of the frontier, the Hindus are anxious to show that they yield\r\nto none in the enthusiasm which marks the demonstrations held in your\r\nhonour. But Your Excellency commands our esteem and regard on other\r\ngrounds also. The deep interest that you have throughout your career\r\nfelt in the welfare of the sepoy, and the closest ties of genuine\r\nfriendship which you have established with many a notable of our\r\ncommunity, have laid us under deep obligations to Your Excellency. The\r\nencouragement that you have given to the organization of the Imperial\r\nService Troops of the Native States is also gratefully appreciated by\r\nus; and only the other day we were gratified to learn the high opinion\r\nYour Excellency entertained of the appearance and military equipment\r\nof the Imperial Service Troops of Jammu and Kashmir, the most\r\nimportant Hindu State in this part of India. We should be wanting in\r\nduty, we feel, did we not on this occasion give expression to the\r\ngreat regret which the news of your approaching departure from India\r\nhas caused among the Hindus of the Punjab, who feel that they are\r\nparting from a kind friend and a sympathetic Ruler. At the same time,\r\nwe feel that the country will not lose the benefit of your mature\r\nexperience and wise counsel for long; for we are hopeful that you may\r\nsome day be called upon to guide the helm of the State in India, a\r\nwork for which you are so specially fitted. In conclusion, we have\r\nonly to pray to the Father of All Good that He may shower His choicest\r\nblessings upon you and your consort--that noble lady who has, in\r\naddition to cheering you in your hard and onerous work in India,\r\nherself done a great deal for the comfort of the soldier and the\r\nsepoy, and that He may grant you many years of happy life--a life\r\nwhich has done so much for the Queen-Empress's dominions, and which\r\nmay yet do much more.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XIV.\r\n\r\n(Referred to in Chapter LXVIII, Note *.)\r\n\r\n_To HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL THE RIGHT HONOURABLE FREDERICK BARON\r\nROBERTS OF KANDAHAR AND WATERFORD, BART., V.C., G.C.B., G.C.I.E.,\r\nR.A., Commander-in-Chief of Her Majesty's Forces in India._\r\n\r\nMAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY,\r\n\r\nWe, the Mahomedans of the Punjab, have dared to approach Your\r\nExcellency with this address with eyes tear-bedimmed, but a face\r\nsmiling. The departure of a noble and well-beloved General like\r\nyourself from our country is in itself a fact that naturally fills our\r\neyes with tears. What could be more sorrowful than this, our farewell\r\nto an old officer and patron of ours, who has passed the prominent\r\nportion of his life in our country, developed our young progeny to\r\nbravery and regular soldiery, decorated them with honours, and created\r\nthem to high titles? Your Excellency's separation is the harder to\r\nbear for the men of the Punjab because it is our Punjab that is proud\r\nof the fact that about forty years ago the foundation stone of all\r\nyour famous and noble achievements, which not only India, but England,\r\nrightly boasts of, was laid down in one of its frontier cities, and\r\nthat the greater part of your indomitable energies was spent in the\r\nPunjab frontier defence. If, therefore, we are sad at separating from\r\nYour Excellency, it will not in any way be looked upon as strange.\r\nBut these feelings of sorrow are mixed with joy when we see that the\r\nuseful officer whom in 1852 we had welcomed at Peshawar, when the star\r\nof his merits was beginning to rise, departs from us in splendour and\r\nglory in the capacity of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armies of a\r\nvast Empire like India, and is an example of the highest type to\r\nall soldiers. This address is too brief for a detail of all the\r\nmeritorious services rendered by your Excellency in the Punjab, India\r\nand other foreign countries from that early epoch to this date. Your\r\nzeal in the Mutiny of 1857, your heroic achievements in the Abyssinian\r\nand Afghan wars, your repeated victories of Kandahar, and your\r\nstatesmanlike conduct of the Burma wars--all these are facts which\r\ndeserve to be written in golden characters in the annals of Indian\r\nhistory. Your appointment as legislative and executive member of the\r\nSupreme Council of the Government of India for a considerable period\r\nhas proved a source of blessings to the whole of India, and Your\r\nExcellency deserves an ample share of the credit due to the Council\r\nfor all its useful regulations and reforms. The great liking that\r\nmen of noble birth in India have been showing for some time towards\r\nmilitary service is a clear demonstration of the excellent treatment\r\nreceived at your hands by military officers, as in the reforms made\r\nby you in the military pay and pension and other regulations. Another\r\nboon for which the Natives of India will always remember your name\r\nwith gratitude, is that you have fully relied upon, and placed your\r\nconfidence in, the Natives, thus uniting them the more firmly to the\r\nBritish Crown, making them more loyal, and establishing the good\r\nrelations between the Rulers and the ruled on a firmer footing to\r\ntheir mutual good. Especially as Mussalmans of the Punjab are we proud\r\nthat before Your Excellency's departure you have had the opportunity\r\nof reviewing the Imperial Service Troops of the Mahomedan State of\r\nBhawalpur, one of the leading Native States of the Punjab, whose\r\nRuler's efforts to make his troops worthy to take their place by the\r\nside of British troops for the defence of India is only one instance\r\nof the spirit of active loyalty which we are glad to say animates the\r\nentire Mussalman community of the Punjab. Disturbances arising from\r\nforeign intrusions are not unknown to us, and we have not sufficient\r\nwords to thank your Lordship for the admirable management of the\r\nfrontier defence work carried on to protect our country from all\r\npossible encroachments. The greatest pleasure and satisfaction,\r\nhowever, that we Mahomedans feel in presenting this address to Your\r\nLordship emanates from the idea that you go on your way home to your\r\nnative country with a high and favourable opinion of the Mahomedans of\r\nIndia, true and loyal subjects to Her Majesty the Queen-Empress, whose\r\nnumber exceeds six crores, and who are rapidly growing. During the\r\nMutiny of 1857 the Chieftains and soldiers of our nation spared\r\nneither money nor arms in the reduction and submission of the rebels.\r\nYour Lordship is also aware what loyalty was displayed by the\r\nMahomedans of India during the Afghan and Egyptian wars, waged against\r\ntheir own co-religionists, and the cheerfulness shown by them in\r\nfollowing your Lordship in all your victories. Frontier services, such\r\nas the Kabul Embassy and the Delimitation Commission, rendered by the\r\nofficers of our creed are also well known to you. We are therefore\r\nsanguine that Your Lordship's own observation will enable all the\r\nmembers of the Ruling race in India to form an opinion of the\r\nrelations that exist between us and the British Crown. The Mahomedans\r\nof India and the Punjab are proud of being the devoted subjects of the\r\nQueen-Empress. In so acting we perform our religious duties, for our\r\nsacred religion enjoins upon us faithfulness and obedience towards our\r\nRuling monarch, and teaches us to regard the Christians as our own\r\nbrethren. The regard and esteem which we should have, therefore, for\r\na Christian Government, as that of our kind mother the Queen-Empress,\r\nneeds no demonstration. Although, for certain reasons which we need\r\nnot detail here, our nation has been deficient in education, and we\r\nhave been left much behind in obtaining civil employment, we hope that\r\nyour long experience of our service will prove a good testimonial in\r\nfavour of the warlike spirit, military genius, and loyalty of\r\nour nation, and if the circle of civil employment has become too\r\nstraitened for us, the military line will be generously opened to us.\r\nWe do not want to encroach upon Your Lordship's valuable time any\r\nfurther. We therefore finish our address, offering our heartfelt\r\nthanks to your Lordship for all those kindnesses you have been wont to\r\nshow during your time towards India and Indians in general, and the\r\nPunjab and Punjabis in particular, and take leave of Your Lordship\r\nwith the following prayer: 'May God bless thee wherever thou mayest\r\nbe, and may thy generosities continue to prevail upon us for a long\r\ntime.' While actuated by these feelings, we are not the less aware\r\nthat our country owes a great deal to Lady Roberts, to whom we beg\r\nthat Your Excellency will convey our heartfelt thanks for her lively\r\ninterest in the welfare of Indian soldiers in particular and the\r\npeople generally. In conclusion, we wish Your Excellencies God-speed\r\nand a pleasant and safe voyage. That Your Excellencies may have\r\nlong, happy, and prosperous lives, and achieve ever so many more\r\ndistinctions and honours, and return to us very shortly in a still\r\nhigher position, to confer upon the Empire the blessings of a\r\nbeneficent Rule, is our heartfelt and most sincere prayer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XV.\r\n\r\n(Referred to in Chapter LXVIII, Note *.)\r\n\r\n_To His EXCELLENCY GENERAL THE RIGHT HONOURABLE FREDERICK BARON\r\nROBERTS OF KANDAHAR AND WATERFORD, BART., V.C., G.C.B., G.C.I.E.,\r\nR.A., Commander-in-Chief of Her Majesty's Forces in India._\r\n\r\nMAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY,\r\n\r\nWe, the representatives of the European community in the Punjab, are\r\nthe prouder to-day of our British blood, in that it links us in close\r\nkinship, to one who has so bravely maintained the honour of the\r\nBritish Empire alike in the years of peace and storm that India has\r\nseen during the last three decades. During the Mutiny Your Excellency\r\nperformed feats of gallantry that are historic. Since then your\r\ncareer has been one of brilliant success and growing military renown.\r\nWhenever, in the histories of war, men speak of famous marches, that\r\nfrom Kabul to Kandahar comes straightway to the lips. When our mind\r\nturns to military administration, we remember the unqualified\r\nsuccess of Your Excellency's career as Quartermaster-General and as\r\nCommander-in-Chief of Her Majesty's Forces in India, in both of which\r\nhigh offices you have added honour and glory to your great name, which\r\nwill never be forgotten in India. When the private soldier, rightly or\r\nwrongly, thinks he has a grievance, his desire is only that somehow it\r\nmay be brought to the notice of Your Excellency, from whom, through\r\nexperience, he expects full justice and generous sympathy. When we\r\nlook towards our frontier and see the strategic railways and roads,\r\nand the strong places of arms that threaten the invader, we know that\r\nfor those safeguards the Empire is in no small degree indebted to\r\nthe resolute wisdom of Your Excellency as military adviser to the\r\nGovernment of India. Last, but not least, as a Statesman, Your\r\nExcellency ranks second to none in the Empire in the opinion of your\r\ncountrymen in this North-West frontier province; and we should gladly\r\nwelcome the day, if it might ever arrive, when Your Excellency\r\nreturned to India. It is here that we see most clearly the passage of\r\nevents beyond our borders and mark the signs of brooding trouble; and\r\nour hope has always been that, when that trouble should break forth,\r\nyours might be the hand to guide England's flag to victory again. The\r\nPunjab is the sword of India, and Your Excellency has had the courage\r\nto lean most strongly upon that sword. It is here that the pulse of\r\nthe army beats in India; it is hence that the enemies of our country\r\nshall feel the downright blow; and it is here that the greatest\r\ngrief is felt in parting from so true a soldier and so far-seeing a\r\nStatesman as Your Excellency. It is meet, therefore, that here we\r\nshould assemble upon this occasion of farewell to express the great\r\nsorrow which we, the representatives of the Europeans in the Punjab,\r\nfeel at the prospect of losing so soon the clear brain and strong hand\r\nthat Your Excellency has always brought to the control of the Army in\r\nIndia and to the solution of all questions of political or military\r\nmoment. In doing so, we mourn for the loss of one of the best\r\nstatesmen, the best general, and the best friend to the soldier in\r\nIndia. We say nothing of the kindly relations Your Excellency has\r\nalways been able to establish with the other races in India; our\r\nfellow-subjects here will doubtless do so in their turn. We say\r\nnothing of Your Excellency's and Lady Roberts' charming social\r\nqualities, nor Her Ladyship's philanthropic work in India. We are here\r\nonly to express our grief at parting with one whom we value so highly\r\nfor the sake of our common country, and our hope that as your past has\r\nbeen full of glory to the Empire and honour to yourself, so may your\r\nfuture be; and that you may be spared for many years to wield the\r\nsword and guide the counsels of our country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XVI.\r\n\r\n(Referred to in Chapter LXVIII, Footnote 11.)\r\n\r\n_To His EXCELLENCY GENERAL THE RIGHT HONOURABLE FREDERICK BARON\r\nROBERTS OF KANDAHAR AND WATERFORD, BART., V.C., G.C.B., G.C.I.E.,\r\nR.A., Commander-in-Chief of Her Imperial Majesty's Army in India._\r\n\r\nMAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY,\r\n\r\nWe, the Talukdars of Oudh, as loyal and faithful subjects of the\r\nEmpress of India, avail ourselves of the present opportunity of\r\noffering Your Excellency a most cordial and respectful welcome to the\r\nCapital of Oudh.\r\n\r\nThe long and valuable services rendered by Your Excellency to the\r\nCrown and the country are well known to, and are deeply appreciated\r\nby, us. Your Excellency's wise and vigorous administration of Her\r\nMajesty's Army in India has won for you our respectful admiration;\r\nwhile your prowess in the battlefield, and your wisdom in Council\r\nduring the eventful period of your supreme command of Her Majesty's\r\nIndian Forces, have inspired us with confidence in your great military\r\ntalents and your single-minded and earnest devotion to duty. In many\r\na battle you have led the British Army to victory, and the brilliant\r\nsuccess which has invariably attended the British Arms under Your\r\nExcellency's command has added to the glory of the British Empire.\r\n\r\nBut the pride and pleasure we feel at being honoured by Your\r\nExcellency's presence in our capital town give place to sorrow and\r\nregret at the approaching retirement of Your Excellency from the great\r\nservice of which you are an ornament.\r\n\r\nIn grateful acknowledgment of the most important services rendered by\r\nYour Excellency to our Empress and our country, we beg to be allowed\r\nthe privilege of presenting you with a Sword of Indian manufacture,\r\nwhich will, we hope, from time to time, remind you of us and of Oudh.\r\n\r\nWishing Your Lordship a safe and pleasant voyage home, and a long and\r\nhappy life,\r\n\r\n  We subscribe ourselves,\r\n  Your Lordship's most humble\r\n  and obedient servants,\r\n  THE TALUKDARS OF OUDH.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX XVII.\r\n\r\n(Referred to in Chapter LXVIII, Footnote 12.)\r\n\r\n_To His EXCELLENCY GENERAL THE RIGHT HONOURABLE SIR FREDERICK\r\nSLEIGH, BARON ROBERTS OF KANDAHAR AND WATERFORD, BART., V.C., G.C.B.,\r\nG.C.I.E., D.C.L., LL.D., R.A., Commander-in-Chief in India._\r\n\r\n\r\nYOUR EXCELLENCY,\r\n\r\nViewing with concern and regret your approaching departure from India,\r\nwe beg--in bidding you farewell--to express our admiration of your\r\nlife and work as Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Forces in India,\r\nand to request you to permit your portrait to be placed in the Town\r\nHall of Calcutta, in token for the present generation of their high\r\nappreciation of your eminent services, and in witness to a\r\nfuture generation of the esteem in which you were held by your\r\ncontemporaries.\r\n\r\nWith foresight denoting wise statesmanship, Governments which you have\r\nserved have initiated and maintained a policy of Frontier Defence, and\r\nencouraged the increased efficiency of the Forces.\r\n\r\nIn the furtherance of these objects we recognize the salient points\r\nof your career and character whilst holding the high rank of\r\nCommander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\nIn your continued efforts to ameliorate the condition of the private\r\nsoldier we recognize broad humanity. In the increasing efficiency of\r\nthe Army, which, in our belief, characterizes your tenure of command,\r\nwe recognize high soldierly qualities. In the state of strength which\r\nthe Frontier Defences have attained, mainly due, we believe, to you,\r\nwe recognize practical sagacity, conspicuous ability in discernment of\r\nrequirements, and in pursuit of your aims an unwearying industry, a\r\nresolute persistence, and a determination that no difficulty can turn,\r\nin which a noble example for all true workers may be found.\r\n\r\nIn a word, your life and work are to us identified with Frontier\r\nDefence and Efficient Forces. We cheerfully bear our share of the\r\ncost, as in possession of these protections against aggression from\r\nwithout, we believe all who dwell within the borders of the land will\r\nfind their best guarantee for peace, and in peace the best safeguard\r\nthey and their children can possess to enable them to pass their lives\r\nin happiness and prosperity, and escape the misery and ruin which\r\nfollow war and invasion. For all that you have done to give them such\r\nsecurity, we feel you deserve, and we freely give, our heartfelt\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\nWithin the limitations of a farewell address, we hardly feel justified\r\nin personal allusions trenching on your private life, but we cannot\r\nrefrain from noticing with responsive sympathy the feeling of personal\r\nattachment to yourself which is widespread throughout India, and\r\nassuring you that we share in it to the fullest extent that private\r\nfeeling can be affected by public services. We endorse our assurance\r\nwith an expression of the wish that, in whatever part of the British\r\nEmpire your future life may be spent, it may be attended, as in the\r\npast, with honour, and, by the blessing of God, with health and\r\nhappiness for yourself and all those you hold dear.\r\n\r\nIt is the prerogative of the Crown alone to bestow honours on those\r\nwho have served their country well, and none have been better merited\r\nthan those which you enjoy, and to which, we trust, additions may be\r\nmade. It is the privilege of a community to make public profession\r\nof merit in a fellow-citizen where they consider it is due, and in\r\navailing ourselves of the privilege to make this public recognition of\r\nthe great services which, in our opinion, you have rendered to India,\r\nwe beg with all sincerity to add a hearty God-speed and a regretful\r\nFarewell.\r\n\r\n  We have the honour to be,\r\n  Your Excellency,\r\n  Your obedient servants.\r\n\r\n  CALCUTTA,\r\n  _11th March, 1893._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\nPERSONS.\r\n\r\nAbbott, General Sir James, K.C.B.\r\nAbdulla Jan\r\nAbdur Rahman\r\nAdams, Rev.
