The remainder originally appeared in\r\nthe _English Historical Review_, but the Elizabethan section has been\r\nrewritten and much enlarged in the light of fresh material found since it\r\nwas first printed, and many additions and alterations have been made to\r\nthe other papers. Of the four Appendices three are new.\r\n\r\nSixteen years ago the _doyen_ of our English naval historians, Professor\r\nJ. K. Laughton, wrote,\r\n\r\n    ‘Every one knows that according to the Act of Parliament, it is\r\n    on the Navy that “under the good providence of God, the wealth,\r\n    safety, and strength of the kingdom chiefly depend,” but there\r\n    are probably few who have realised the full meaning of that\r\n    grave sentence.’[1]\r\n\r\nSince those words were penned, a more widely diffused interest in naval\r\nmatters has permeated all classes of society, and there is, happily, a\r\nvastly increased perception of what the Navy means for England and the\r\nEmpire.[2] The greater interest taken in naval progress has caused a\r\nnew attention to be bestowed on the early history of the Navy, and there\r\nis little apology required for the plan—however much may be needed for\r\nthe execution—of a work dealing with the civil organisation under which\r\nthe executive has toiled and fought. Whole libraries have been written\r\nabout fleets and expeditions, but there has never yet been any systematic\r\nhistory of the organisation that rendered action on a large scale\r\npossible, or of the naval administration generally, and although its\r\nrecord does not appear to the writer to be a matter for national pride,\r\nit has its importance as a corollary of—and if only as a foil to—that\r\nof the Navy proper. This work as a whole, is therefore intended to be a\r\nhistory of the later Royal Navy, and of naval administration, from the\r\naccession of Henry VIII until the close of the Napoleonic wars, in all\r\nthe details connected with the subject except those relating to actual\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\nThe historical evolution of many of the great administrative offices of\r\nthe state, as they exist now, can be, in most cases, observed through\r\nthe centuries and the course and causes of their growth traced with\r\nsufficient exactness. Originally a delegation of some one or more\r\nof the functions of the monarch, they have developed from small and\r\nobscure beginnings in the far off past and increased with the growth of\r\nthe nation. The naval administration of to-day has no such dignity of\r\nantiquity. It will be for the readers of these volumes in their entirety\r\nto decide whether it has earned that higher honour which comes of loyal\r\nservice performed with justice to the subordinates dependent on it,\r\nand with honesty to the British people who have entrusted it with such\r\nimportant duties.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Admiralty came into power subsequent to the period at which\r\nthis volume ends. It dates, properly from 1689, or, at the utmost,\r\nreaches back to 1673, but its forerunner, the modern administration which\r\nis the subject of the present volume, sprang full grown into life in 1546\r\nwhen the outgrown mediæval system ended. The Admiralty Board is in the\r\nplace, and administers the duties, of the Lord Admiral, but that officer\r\nalthough the titular head of the Navy never had any very active or\r\ncontinuous part in administration, nor was the post itself a very ancient\r\none. James, Duke of York, afterwards James II, was the first Lord Admiral\r\nwho really took actual charge of domestic naval affairs and the Admiralty\r\nsucceeded him, and to his powers, thus overshadowing the Navy Board.\r\nBetween 1546 and 1618, the Navy was governed by the Principal Officers,\r\ncontrolling the various branches of naval work, who constituted the Navy\r\nBoard; between 1618 and 1689 we have a transitional period when the Navy\r\nOfficers, Commissioners of the Admiralty, Parliamentary Committees, Lord\r\nAdmiral, and the King, were all at different times, and occasionally\r\nsimultaneously, ruling and directing. The Admiralty now more nearly\r\nrepresents in function and composition the old Navy Board, abolished\r\nin ignominy in 1832, than the Board of the seventeenth or eighteenth\r\ncenturies with which, except in the power still retained by the First\r\nLord, it has little in common but name.\r\n\r\nOur subject then in this volume, is the Navy Board as the predominant\r\nauthority between 1546 and 1660. Although a history of the modern\r\nadministration should in exactness, therefore, begin in 1546, an academic\r\npreciseness of date would be obtained at the expense of historical\r\naccuracy since Henry VIII remodelled the Navy, before he touched the\r\nadministration. The year of his accession has therefore been chosen\r\nas the starting point. But it should be borne in mind that there is\r\nvery much less difference between the great and complex administration\r\nof to-day, and the Navy Board or—as it was then sometimes called—the\r\nAdmiralty, of 24th April 1546, than between the Board of 24th April and\r\nwhat existed the day before. Within the twenty-four hours the old system\r\nhad been swept away and replaced; its successor has altered in form but\r\nnot in principle.\r\n\r\nThe sources of information are sufficiently indicated by the references.\r\nThe great majority of them being used for the first time, subsequent\r\ninquiry may modify or alter some of the conclusions here reached. Unless\r\na date is given in a double form (_e.g._ 20th February 1558-9) it will be\r\nunderstood to be new or present style, so far as the year is concerned.\r\nFew attempts have been made to give the modern equivalents of the\r\nvarious sums of money mentioned during so many periods when values were\r\ncontinually fluctuating. With one exception all the MS. collections known\r\nto the writer, likely to be of value, have been fully examined, but there\r\nare also many papers not available for research in the possession of\r\nprivate owners. The one exception referred to is the collection of Pepys\r\nMSS., at Magdalene College, Cambridge. An application to examine these\r\nwas refused on the ground that a member of the university was working at\r\nthem. It is to be hoped that this ingenuous adaptation of the principles\r\nof Protection to historical investigation will duly stimulate production.\r\n\r\nThere remains the pleasant duty of thanking those from whom I have\r\nreceived assistance. To Mr S. R. Gardiner, and Professor J. K. Laughton,\r\nI am obliged for various suggestions on historical and naval questions;\r\nto Professor F. Elgar for information on the difficult subject of tonnage\r\nmeasurement. I have to thank Mr F. J. Simmons for assistance in the task\r\nof index compilation and proof-reading.\r\n\r\nAs this is the first opportunity I have had of publicly acknowledging my\r\nindebtedness to Mr E. Salisbury of the Record Office, I am glad to be now\r\nable to express my sincere gratitude to that gentleman for constant and\r\ncordially given help in many ways during the five years this book has\r\nbeen in preparation.\r\n\r\n_September 1896._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nTHE NAVY BEFORE 1509\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Modern Navy.]\r\n\r\nThe creation of the modern Royal Navy has been variously attributed to\r\nHenry VII, to Henry VIII, and to Elizabeth. Whichever sovereign may be\r\nconsidered entitled to the honour, the statement, as applied to either\r\nmonarch, really means that modification of mediæval conditions, and\r\nadoption of improvements in construction and administration, which\r\nbrought the Navy into the form familiar to us until the introduction of\r\nsteam and iron. And in that sense no one sovereign can be accredited\r\nwith its formation. The introduction of portholes in, or perhaps before\r\nthe reign of Henry VII, differentiated the man-of-war, involved radical\r\nalterations in build and armament, and made the future line-of-battle\r\nship possible; the establishment of the Navy Board by Henry VIII,\r\nmade the organisation of fleets feasible and ensured a certain, if\r\nslow, progress because henceforward cumulative and, in the long run,\r\nindependent of the energy and foresight of any one man under whom, as\r\nunder Henry V, the Navy might largely advance, to sink back at his death\r\ninto decay. Under Elizabeth the improvements in building and rigging\r\nconstituted a step longer than had yet been taken towards the modern\r\ntype, the Navy Board became an effectively working and flourishing\r\ninstitution, and the wars and voyages of her reign founded the school\r\nof successful seamanship of which was born the confidence, daring and\r\nself-reliance still prescriptive in the royal and merchant services.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The origin of the Navy:—William I.]\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this work to deal with the history, of the\r\nNavy previous to the accession of Henry VIII, but no real line of\r\ndemarcation can be drawn in naval more than in other history, and it will\r\nbe necessary to briefly sketch the conditions generally existing before\r\n1509, and in somewhat more detail, those relating to the fifteenth\r\ncentury.[3] In the widest sense the first Saxon king who possessed\r\ngalleys of his own may be said to have been the founder of the Royal\r\nNavy; in a narrower but truer sense, the Royal Navy as an appanage of\r\nimperial power, and an entity of steady growth, really dates from the\r\nNorman conquest. The Saxon navy although respectable by way of number,\r\nwas essentially a coast defence force, mustered temporarily to answer\r\nmomentary needs, and lacking continuity of existence and purpose. There\r\nis but one instance of a Saxon fleet being employed out of the four\r\nseas, that which Canute used in the conquest of Norway, and in it the\r\nScandinavian element was probably larger than the Saxon. With the advent\r\nof William I, the channel, instead of remaining a boundary, became a\r\nmeans of communication between the divided dominions of one monarch, and\r\na comparatively permanent and reliable naval force, both for military\r\ntransport and for command of the passage between the insular and\r\ncontinental possessions of the Crown, became a necessity of royal policy.\r\nFor nearly two centuries this duty was mainly performed by the men of\r\nthe Cinque Ports who, in return for certain privileges and exemptions,\r\nwere bound, at any moment, to place fifty-seven ships at the service of\r\nthe Crown for fifteen days free of cost, and for as much longer time as\r\nthe king required them at the customary rate of pay.[4] These claims,\r\npractically constituting the Cinque Ports fleet a standing force, were\r\nceaselessly exercised by successive monarchs, and, at first sight, such\r\ndemands might seem to be destructive of that commercial progress which\r\nis the primary basis of the growth or maintenance of shipping. But the\r\nmethods of warfare in those ages were more profitable than commerce, and\r\nthe decay of the Ports was not due to poverty caused by the calls made\r\nupon their shipping for military purposes. The existence of the Cinque\r\nPorts service was indirectly a hindrance to the growth of a crown navy,\r\nsince it was obviously cheaper for the king to order the Ports to act\r\nthan to man and equip his own vessels; it was not until ships of larger\r\nsize and stronger build than those belonging to the Ports were required,\r\nthat the royal ships came into frequent use.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Results of the Conquest:—Growth of Trade and Shipping.]\r\n\r\nAs well as mobilising the Cinque Ports fleet, the sovereign was able to\r\nissue writs to arrest the ships of private owners throughout the kingdom,\r\ntogether with the necessary number of sailors, when rival fleets had to\r\nbe fought or armies to be transported. The Normans, descendants of the\r\nVikings, must have been better shipbuilders and better seamen than the\r\nSaxons, and the large number of nautical words that can be traced back to\r\nNorman French bear witness to improvements in rigging and handling due to\r\nthem. The Crusades must have reacted on the English marine by bringing\r\nunder the observation of our seamen the construction of ships belonging\r\nto the Mediterranean powers, then far in advance of the North in the art\r\nof shipbuilding. And during the century which followed the Conquest, the\r\nforeign trade, which is the nursery of shipping, was steadily growing.\r\nUnder the Angevin kings the whole coast line of France, from Flanders to\r\nBayonne, was, with the exception of Brittany, subject to English rule,\r\nand the inter-coast traffic that naturally followed was the greatest\r\nstimulus to maritime enterprise this country had yet experienced. The\r\nresult was seen in the Crusade of 1190, when the fleet of Richard I\r\nfor the Mediterranean was made up of vessels drawn from the ports of\r\nthe empire, but many of them doubtless belonging to the continental\r\npossessions of the crown; and as John certainly possessed ships of his\r\nown, it may be inferred that Richard, and his predecessors also had some.\r\nWhen a general arrest was ordered, foreign ships were seized as well\r\nas English, and this practice continued as late as the first years of\r\nElizabeth. Richard I issued, in 1190, regulations for the government of\r\nhis fleet. These regulations doubtless only methodised customs already\r\nexisting, and as they dealt with offences against life and property bear\r\nthe mark of their commercial origin. Offences against discipline must\r\nhave been punished by military law and military penalties, and required\r\nno new code.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: John:—The Clerk of the Ships.]\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of John we meet the first sign of a naval administration\r\nin the official action of William of Wrotham, like many of his successors\r\na cleric, and the first known ‘Keeper of the king’s ships.’ This\r\noffice, possibly in its original form of very much earlier date and\r\nonly reconstituted or enlarged in function by John, and now represented\r\nin descent by the Secretaryship of the Admiralty, is the oldest\r\nadministrative employment in connection with the Navy. At first called\r\n‘Keeper and Governor’ of the king’s ships, later, ‘Clerk of the king’s\r\nships,’ this official held, sometimes really and sometimes nominally,\r\nthe control of naval organisation until the formation of the Navy Board\r\nin 1546. His duties included all those now performed by a multitude of\r\nhighly placed Admiralty officials. If a man of energy, experience, and\r\ncapacity, his name stands foremost in the maintenance of the royal fleets\r\nduring peace and their preparation for war; if, as frequently happened,\r\na merchant or subordinate official with no especial knowledge, he\r\nmight become a mere messenger riding from port to port, seeking runaway\r\nsailors, or bargaining for small parcels of naval stores. Occasionally,\r\nunder such circumstances, his authority was further lessened by the\r\nappointment of other persons, usually such as held minor personal\r\noffices near the king, as keepers of particular ships. This was a method\r\nof giving a small pecuniary reward to such a one, together with the\r\nperquisites he might be able to procure from the supply of stores and\r\nprovisions necessary for the vessel and her crew.\r\n\r\nIn the course of centuries the title changed its form. In the fifteenth\r\nand sixteenth centuries the officer is called ‘clerk of marine causes,’\r\nand ‘clerk of the navy;’ in the seventeenth century, ‘clerk of the\r\nacts.’ Although Pepys was not the last clerk of the acts, the functions\r\nassociated with the office, which were the remains of the larger powers\r\nonce belonging to the ‘Keeper and Governor,’ were carried up by him to\r\nthe higher post of Secretary of the Admiralty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry III.]\r\n\r\nWith the reign of Henry III we find the royal ships large enough to\r\nbecome attractive to merchants, who hired them from the king for freight,\r\nperhaps at lower rates than could be afforded by private owners. There\r\nis hardly a reign, down to and including that of Elizabeth, in which\r\nmen-of-war were not hired by merchants, and the earlier trading voyages\r\nto Italy and the Levant during the last quarter of the fifteenth\r\ncentury were nearly all performed by men-of-war let out for the voyage.\r\nThe Navy was mainly made up of sailing vessels even before the reign\r\nof Henry III, and by that period many of them possessed two masts,\r\neach carrying a single sail. The conversion of a merchantman into a\r\nfighting-ship was accomplished by fitting it with temporary fore and\r\nafter castles, which became later the permanent forecastle and poop, the\r\naddition of a ‘top castle’ or fighting top, and the provision of proper\r\narmament. Doubtless the king’s own ships were more strongly built, and\r\nbetter adapted by internal arrangements for their work, than the hired\r\nmerchantmen. The supreme government of the Navy in the thirteenth and\r\nfourteenth centuries was in the hands of the King’s Council, who ordered,\r\nequally, the preparation and fitting of ships and the action of the\r\nadmirals commanding. These officers, known during the greater part of\r\nthe thirteenth century as keepers or governors of the sea, were usually\r\nknights or nobles in command of the soldiers. While holding commission\r\nthey appear to have had jurisdiction in the matter of discipline on\r\nboard their fleets, but not of law suits or maritime causes until 1360;\r\nbefore that date such causes were dealt with at common law.[5] There\r\nwere usually two, one having charge of the East, the other of the South\r\nCoast, but occasionally, an officer had a particular section placed under\r\nhis care, such as the coasts of Norfolk and Suffolk. Their period of\r\nservice was commonly short and often only for a special employment. The\r\nmaintenance of a fleet was a part of the King’s Household expenses; in\r\nthe Wardrobe Accounts for 1299-1300 are the amounts paid for fifty-four\r\nvessels and their crews hired for the conveyance of stores for the Scotch\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Galleys.]\r\n\r\nGalleys, although frequently mentioned, were at no time a chief\r\nportion of our fleets. Large fleets were mainly composed of impressed\r\nmerchantmen, and galleys are expensive and useless for trading purposes\r\ncompared with sailing ships; the natural home of the galley was the\r\nlandlocked Mediterranean, and even there its utility was limited to\r\nthe summer months, so that it was still less suitable for Northern\r\nlatitudes. But the great difficulty was in manning them. Forced labour by\r\ncaptives taken in the continual warfare normal amongst the states on the\r\nMediterranean littoral solved that problem for them, but here the cost\r\nof the free oarsman, to whom the drudgery was in any case distasteful,\r\nwas prohibitive. We shall see that, down to the close of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, attempts were at various times made to form such a service, but\r\nalways unsuccessfully, and the supreme moment of the galley service, so\r\nfar as it ever existed here, was the reign of Edward I.[6] This king\r\nsteadily increased the strength of the Navy. In 1294 and 1295 galleys\r\nwere built by him at York, Southampton, Lynn, Newcastle and Ipswich,\r\nof which at least two pulled 120 oars apiece. Perhaps the experiment\r\nwas conclusive for, neither as regards number or size do such ever\r\noccur again. Although Edward III had one or two built, most of those he\r\nemployed were temporarily hired from the Genoese or from Aquitainean\r\nports, and the total number bore a very small proportion to the sailing\r\nvessels in his fleets. The records of the first years of Edward II show\r\nthat the crown possessed at least eleven vessels, all sailing ships, but\r\nthe circumstances of the reign were not conducive to the growth of a\r\nRoyal Navy, although there seem to have been ten ships in 1322.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Edward III:—Relative estimation of Army and Navy.]\r\n\r\nA far-seeing statesmanship in relation to the political value of\r\nsea-power has been attributed to Edward III on the strength of the\r\nvictories of 1340 and 1350, and of two lines of a poem, written nearly\r\na century later, referring to the gold noble of 1344.[7] This view\r\nassigns to Edward a knowledge, in the modern sense, of ‘the influence of\r\nsea-power on history’ greater than that possessed by such a statesman as\r\nEdward I, and a policy in connection with maritime matters of which the\r\nresults, at anyrate, were directly the opposite of his intentions. The\r\nclaim to be lord of the narrow seas was not a new one, and was as much\r\nand merely a title of dignity as any other of the sovereign’s verbal\r\nhonours, not following the actual enforcement of ownership but consequent\r\nto the fact of the channel lying between England and Normandy.[8] And it\r\nwas a title also claimed by France. There is no sign in the policy of\r\nthe early kings of any perception of the value of a navy as a militant\r\ninstrument like an army, or any sense of the importance of a real\r\ncontinuity in its maintenance and use. Society was based on a military\r\norganisation, but there was no place in that organisation for the Navy\r\nexcept as a subsidiary and dependent force. Fleets were called into being\r\nto transport soldiery abroad, to keep open communications, or to meet\r\nan enemy already at sea, but the real work of conquest was always held\r\nto be the duty of the knights and archers they carried from one country\r\nto another. There is no understanding shewn of the ceaseless pressure\r\na navy is capable of exercising, and the disbandment of all, or the\r\ngreater part, of the fleet was usually the first step which followed the\r\ndisembarkation of troops or a successful fleet action. In an age when\r\nthe land transit of goods was hampered by innumerable disadvantages,\r\nthe position of England, dominating the natural way of communication\r\nbetween the prosperous cities of the north and their customers, was\r\none of splendid command had its far-reaching political possibilities\r\nbeen realised. That they did not comprehend a function only understood\r\nmany generations later cannot be made a subject of censure, but it has\r\na distinct bearing on the question of Edward’s superiority in this\r\nmatter to his predecessors and successors. In the same way as theirs the\r\nmethods of Edward III were directed to conquests by land, and, once the\r\ntroops were transported or an opposing fleet actually in existence was\r\ncrushed, the Channel was left as bare of protection to merchantmen, and\r\nas destitute of any power capable of enforcing the reputed sovereignty of\r\nthe narrow seas, as it remained down to the days of the Commonwealth.\r\nBeyond the fact that in 1340 and 1350 Edward commanded in person, where\r\nhis predecessors had been represented by deputies, his action in relation\r\nto the Royal Navy differs in no respects from theirs. The gold noble of\r\n1344, into which so much meaning has been read, was struck in combination\r\nwith the people of Flanders for political and trading purposes, and in\r\nconnection with Edward’s intrigues to obtain their financial and military\r\nsupport. It is noteworthy that in December 1339, six months before the\r\nbattle of Sluys, Flanders, Brabant, and Hainault, agreed that a common\r\ncoinage should be struck, and this, in all probability, marks the first\r\ninception of the noble when Edward realised the purposes to which a\r\ncommon coinage for England and the Low Countries might be made to work.\r\nIn 1343 the Commons petitioned for a gold coin to run equally in England\r\nand Flanders and thus strengthened the king’s purpose. But the ship on\r\nthis coin, the noble, was obviously an afterthought since the florin, the\r\nfirst issue of the same year, called in on account of its unpopularity,\r\nbore the royal leopard on the whole and half noble and the royal crest on\r\nthe quarter one; if therefore the king meant all that is supposed to be\r\nimplied by the device it occurred to him very suddenly and subsequent to\r\nthe first, and deliberately thought out, issue.[9] All that the writer of\r\nthe _Libel of English Policie_ says is that, in 1436, the noble proves to\r\nhim four things. Further reasons, in relation to other passages of the\r\npoem, will be adduced on a later page to show that his work is only one\r\nmore instance among the many in which individual and unofficial thinkers\r\nhave been in advance of the statesmanship of their age and whose views,\r\nignored by their contemporaries have become the accepted opinions of a\r\nsubsequent period.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Edward III:—Commercial policy in relation to shipping.]\r\n\r\nThe commercial policy of Edward III was emphatically not one of\r\nprotection to English shipping, being a nearer approach to free trade\r\nthan existed for centuries after his death. During the greater part of\r\nhis reign the needs in ships for his campaigns were supplied from the\r\naccumulations of the reigns of Edward I and Edward II, the second of\r\nwhich was not necessarily disastrous to commerce. But when these were\r\nexhausted it was found that a system which had aimed merely at obtaining\r\na highest possible yearly revenue for the purpose of supporting armies\r\nhad, whether or not in itself, fiscally praiseworthy resulted in the\r\nruin of English shipping. In 1372 and 1373, the Commons complained of\r\nthe destruction of shipping and the decay of the port towns, and it is\r\ncollateral evidence of Edward’s real lack of insight into the value of a\r\nmarine—its slow creation and its easy loss—that some of the causes to\r\nwhich they attributed these circumstances were directly due to a reckless\r\nindifference to, or ignorance of, the only conditions which could render\r\na merchant marine, subject to conscription, possible.[10] Vessels,\r\nthey said, were pressed long before they were really wanted, and until\r\nactually taken into the service of the crown, ships were idle and seamen\r\nhad to be paid and supported at the expense of the owners; the effect of\r\nroyal ordinances which had driven many shipowners to other occupations,\r\nand the decrease in the number of sailors due to these and other causes,\r\nformed further articles of remonstrance.[11]\r\n\r\nThe year which saw the decease of the ‘Lord of the Sea,’ was marked\r\nby the sack of Rye, Lewes, Hastings, Yarmouth, Dartmouth, Plymouth,\r\nFolkestone, Portsmouth, and the Isle of Wight, a sufficient commentary\r\non the title, and an adequate illustration of the system which had left\r\nabsolutely no navy, royal or mercantile, capable of protecting the coasts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Payment of hired ships.]\r\n\r\nIn 1378 the Commons again attributed the defenceless state of the kingdom\r\nnot so much to the late king’s impressment of ships as to the losses and\r\npoverty caused by non-payment, or delay in payment for their use, and\r\nlack of compensation for waste of fittings and stores. Every meeting\r\nof Parliament was signalised by fresh representations, and that of\r\n1380 obtained a promise that owners should receive 3s 4d a ‘ton-tight’\r\nfor every three months, commencing from the day of arrival at the port\r\nof meeting; in 1385 this allowance was reduced to two shillings, and\r\nremained at that rate, notwithstanding frequent petitions for a return to\r\nthe older amount, for at least half a century.[12] It is not known when\r\nthe payment of 3s 4d a ton was first introduced, nor on what principle\r\nit was calculated, but, in 1416, the Commons said that it ran ‘from\r\nbeyond the time of memory.’ The following petition, undated, but probably\r\nbelonging to one of the early years of Henry IV, shows that it was older\r\nthan the Edwards, and, incidentally, yields some interesting information:\r\n\r\n    ‘To the very noble and very wise lords of this present\r\n    Parliament very humbly supplicate all owners of ships in this\r\n    kingdom. That whereas in the time of the noble King Edward\r\n    and his predecessors, whenever any ship was commanded for\r\n    service that the owner of such a ship took 3s 4d per ton-tight\r\n    in the three months by way of reward for repair of the ship\r\n    and its gear, and the fourth part of any prize made at sea,\r\n    by which reward the shipping of this kingdom was then well\r\n    maintained and ruled so that at that time, 150 ships of the\r\n    Tower were available in the kingdom;[13] and since the decease\r\n    of the noble King Edward, in the time of Richard, late King\r\n    of England, the said reward was reduced to two shillings the\r\n    ton-tight, and this very badly paid, so that the owners of such\r\n    ships show no desire to keep up and maintain their ships, but\r\n    have them lying useless; and by this cause the shipping of this\r\n    kingdom is so diminished and deteriorated that there be not in\r\n    all the kingdom more than 25 ships of the Tower.’[14]\r\n\r\nThey then beg a return to the old rates. We may gather from this document\r\nthat, at some time during the reign of Edward III there were one hundred\r\nand fifty large fighting ships available, and there is some reason to\r\nbelieve that, both in number and size, the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncentury navy has been too much underrated when compared with that of the\r\nsixteenth century. At least one merchantman of the time of Edward III was\r\nof three hundred tons, others were of two hundred, and it will be shown\r\nthat, in the middle of the fifteenth century, the number and tonnage of\r\nmerchant vessels will compare favourably with any subsequent period up\r\nto, and in fact later, than the accession of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The close of the xiv century:—The French Navy.]\r\n\r\nWhile, under Richard II, the guard of the seas was maintained with\r\nchequered success by hired ships, the French, under the able rule of\r\nCharles V, not only possessed a navy but had founded a dockyard at Rouen\r\ncompletely equipped according to the ideas of the age.[15] Thirteen\r\ngalleys and two barges are mentioned in this account, with all the tools,\r\nfittings, and armament necessary for building, repairing, and equipment,\r\nand constituting a complete establishment such as did not exist in\r\nEngland until more than a century later. The accession of Charles VI,\r\nand the internal dissensions which culminated in Azincourt, determined\r\nan essay not again attempted on the Northern or Western coasts until the\r\nministry of Richelieu.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Richard II and Henry IV.]\r\n\r\nThe first Navigation Act,[16] ‘to increase the Navy of England which is\r\nnow greatly diminished,’ by making it compulsory for English subjects to\r\nexport and import goods in English ships, with a majority of the crews\r\nsubjects of the English crown, can only be regarded as a suggestion of\r\nfuture legislation. In fact, it was practically annulled by a permissive\r\namendment the following year. More disastrous to merchants than the\r\nlosses due to warfare were the operations of the pirates who swarmed on\r\nthe Northern Coasts of Europe during these centuries, and who appear to\r\nhave become unbearably successful during the reign of Henry IV. This\r\nking appears to have cared little for his titular sovereignty of the\r\nseas, ignored every petition of Parliament for redress of the especial\r\ngrievances affecting shipowners, and used such fleets as he got together,\r\nas his predecessors had used them, simply as a means of transporting\r\ntroops to make weak and useless attacks at isolated points. Tunnage and\r\npoundage had been first levied by an order of Council in 1347, and year\r\nby year following, by agreement with the merchants; from 1373 it became\r\na parliamentary grant of two shillings on the tun of wine, and sixpence\r\nin the pound on merchandise, for the protection of the narrow seas and\r\nthe support of the Navy.[17] The tunnage and poundage now given was, if\r\napplied at all to naval purposes, not used with the least success. It\r\nwas then, in May 1406, together with the fourth part of a subsidy on\r\nwools, handed over to a committee of merchants, who undertook the duty of\r\nclearing the seas for a period of sixteen months. The arrangement between\r\nthe king and the committee was quite an amicable one, but in October\r\nof the same year Henry withdrew from the agreement, and it is doubtful\r\nwhether the members of the committee ever received any portion of their\r\noutlay.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Growth of Trade and Shipping.]\r\n\r\nIf the Norman Conquest gave the first great impulse to English over-sea\r\ntrade, the events of the close of the fourteenth and first half of the\r\nfifteenth centuries may be held to mark the second important era in the\r\ndevelopment of merchant shipping by the opening up of fresh markets.\r\nHitherto the products of the countries of the Baltic had been mainly\r\nobtained through the agency of the merchants of the Hansa, who had their\r\nchief factory in London, with branches at York, Lynn, and Boston. In\r\nthe same way English exports found their way to the north only through\r\nHansa merchants and in Hansa ships. For two centuries they had held a\r\nmonopoly of the purchase and export of the products of the north, by\r\nvirtue of treaties with, and payments made to, the northern powers, and\r\nan unlicensed, but very effective, warfare waged on all ships which\r\nventured to trade through the Sound. But the war against Waldemar III of\r\nDenmark, the depredations of the organised pirate republic known as the\r\nVictual brothers, followed by the struggle with Eric XIII of Sweden, were\r\ntimes of disorder lasting through more than half a century, from which\r\nthe Hansa emerged nominally victorious but with the loss of the prestige\r\nand vigour that had made its monopoly possible. While it was fighting\r\nto uphold its pretensions the Dutch and English had both seized the\r\nopportunity of forcing their way into the Baltic, and when, in 1435, the\r\nHansa extorted from its antagonists a triumphant peace the real utility\r\nof the privileges thus obtained had passed away for ever.\r\n\r\nCoincidently with these events economic changes were taking place at\r\nhome which, by favouring the accumulation of capital, had also a direct\r\ninfluence on the demand for shipping. The temporary renewal of possession\r\nin the coast line of France was a spur to trade with it in English\r\nbottoms. The growth of the towns, the necessity the townsmen experienced\r\nfor the profitable use of surplus capital, and the slow change,\r\nwhich commenced under Edward III, in the national industry from wool\r\nexportation to cloth manufacture, were all elements which found ultimate\r\nexpression in increased export and import in native shipping.[18]\r\nPossibly the most important factor in the change was the commencing\r\nmanufacture of English cloth, instead of selling the wool to foreign\r\nmerchants and buying it back from them in the finished state.[19] During\r\nthe reign of Henry V, English ships were stretching down to Lisbon and\r\nthe coast of Morocco, and British fishermen were plying their industry\r\noff Iceland. Not long afterwards the first English trader entered the\r\nMediterranean, and the numerous entries in the records relating to\r\nmerchant vessels show the flourishing state of trade. By example, and\r\ndoubtless by persuasion, Henry himself assisted in the renewal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry V:—The Royal Ships.]\r\n\r\nUnder Henry’s rule the crown navy was increased till in magnitude it\r\nexceeded the naval power of any previous reign; the character of the\r\nvessels, bought or built, shows that they were provided for seagoing\r\npurposes rather than the mere escort or transport of troops which had\r\nbeen the object of preceding kings, and which object would have been\r\nequally well served by the hired merchantmen that had contented them. The\r\nking himself hired at various times many foreign vessels, but purely for\r\ntransport purposes.\r\n\r\nThe following, compiled from the accounts of Catton and Soper,\r\nsuccessively keepers of the ships, is a more complete list of Henry’s\r\nnavy than has yet been printed:—[20]\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------------+-------+-------+------+\r\n  |        SHIPS                       | Built | Prize | Tons |\r\n  +------------------------------------+-------+-------+------+\r\n  | _Jesus of the Tower_               |       |       | 1000 |\r\n  | _Holigost of the Tower_            | 1414  |       |  760 |\r\n  | _Trinity Royal of the Tower_       | 1416  |       |  540 |\r\n  | _Grace Dieu of the Tower_          | 1418  |       |  400 |\r\n  | _Thomas of the Tower_[21]          | 1420  |       |  180 |\r\n  | _Grande Marie of the Tower_        |       | 1416  |  420 |\r\n  | _Little Marie of the Tower_        |       |       |  140 |\r\n  | _Katrine of the Tower_             |       |       |      |\r\n  | _Christopher Spayne of the Tower_  |       | 1417  |  600 |\r\n  | _Marie Spayne of the Tower_        |       | 1417  |      |\r\n  | _Holigost Spayne of the Tower_     |       | 1417  |  290 |\r\n  | _Philip of the Tower_              |       |       |      |\r\n  | _Little Trinity of the Tower_      |       |       |  120 |\r\n  | _Great Gabriel of the Tower_       |       |       |      |\r\n  | _Cog John of the Tower_            |       |       |      |\r\n  | _Red Cog of the Tower_             |       |       |      |\r\n  | _Margaret of the Tower_            |       |       |      |\r\n  +------------------------------------+-------+-------+------+\r\n  |        CARRACKS                    | Built | Prize | Tons |\r\n  +------------------------------------+-------+-------+------+\r\n  | _Marie Hampton_                    |       | 1416  |  500 |\r\n  | _Marie Sandwich_                   |       | 1416  |  550 |\r\n  | _George of the Tower_              |       | 1416  |  600 |\r\n  | _Agase of the Tower_               |       | 1416  |      |\r\n  | _Peter of the Tower_               |       | 1417  |      |\r\n  | _Paul of the Tower_                |       | 1417  |      |\r\n  | _Andrew of the Tower_              |       | 1417  |      |\r\n  +------------------------------------+-------+-------+------+\r\n  |        BARGES                      | Built | Prize | Tons |\r\n  +------------------------------------+-------+-------+------+\r\n  | _Valentine of the Tower_           |  1418 |       |  100 |\r\n  | _Marie Bretton of the Tower_       |       |       |      |\r\n  +------------------------------------+-------+-------+------+\r\n  |        BALINGERS                   | Built | Prize | Tons |\r\n  +------------------------------------+-------+-------+------+\r\n  | _Katrine Breton of the Tower_      |       | 1416  |      |\r\n  | _James of the Tower_               |  1417 |       |      |\r\n  | _Ane of the Tower_                 |  1417 |       |  120 |\r\n  | _Swan of the Tower_                |  1417 |       |   20 |\r\n  | _Nicholas of the Tower_            |  1418 |       |  120 |\r\n  | _George of the Tower_              |       |       |  120 |\r\n  | _Gabriel of the Tower_             |       |       |      |\r\n  | _Gabriel de Harfleur of the Tower_ |       |       |      |\r\n  | _Little John of the Tower_         |       |       |      |\r\n  | _Fawcon of the Tower_              |       |       |   80 |\r\n  | _Roos_                             |       |       |   30 |\r\n  | _Cracchere of the Tower_           |       |       |   56 |\r\n  +------------------------------------+-------+-------+------+\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that there is no galley in this list; one is referred\r\nto in the accounts, but had apparently ceased to exist, her fittings\r\nbeing used for other ships. Oars occur among the equipments, but probably\r\nin most cases, for the ‘great boat’ which with a ‘cokk’ was attached\r\nto each vessel. Few cannon were carried—if the schedules represent the\r\nfull armament—the _Holigost_ six, the _Thomas_ four, the _George_ and\r\n_Grace Dieu_ three each, the _Katrine_ and _Andrew_ two. The inventories\r\nof stores at this date show very little difference from the preceding\r\ncentury in the character of tackle and gear, nor is there any great\r\nalteration for some two centuries from 1350. English vessels were, on an\r\naverage, smaller at this time than either Italian, Spanish, or German.\r\nThe tomb of Simon of Utrecht, a Hansa admiral who died in 1437, has a\r\nsculpture of a three-masted vessel; if any of Henry’s were three-masted\r\nthey were certainly the first of that class in our service. The statement\r\nof Stow, however, that the vessels captured in 1417 ‘were of marvellous\r\ngreatnesse, yea, greater than ever were seen in those parts before that\r\ntime,’ is, if patriotic, as absurdly incorrect as some other of his naval\r\ninformation. The payments for hired ships show that vessels of 400 and\r\n450 tons, belonging to Dantzic and other ports, were taken up for the\r\ntransport of troops and, putting aside the tonnage of some of the English\r\nships, there is no reason to suppose that the North German traders were\r\nthe largest of their kind. The prizes of 1416 were Spanish and Genoese\r\ncarracks in French pay, captured by the Duke of Bedford in the action of\r\n15th August off the mouth of the Seine;[22] those of 1417 by the Earl of\r\nHuntingdon in that of 25th July.\r\n\r\nThe tonnage of the English built ships shows that there was now a well\r\nmarked tendency to increase in size, probably due to Henry’s initiative.\r\nThe usual measurement, in the fifteenth century, of a barge was about\r\nsixty or eighty tons, and of a balinger[23] about forty. But a man-of-war\r\nbalinger might be much larger as in the _Nicholas of the Tower_, the\r\n_George_, and the _Ane_. There is very little information as to the\r\nconditions under which Henry’s ships were built. The _Trinity Royal_,\r\n_Grace Dieu_, _Holigost_ and _Gabriel_ were certainly constructed at\r\nSouthampton, the two last named under the supervision of William Soper,\r\nthen merely a merchant of the town, who remained many years unpaid the\r\nmoney advanced by him for that purpose; in April 1417 he was given an\r\nannuity of twenty marks a year, doubtless by way of reward.[24] The\r\n_Thomas of the Tower_ was rebuilt at Deptford in 1420; the _Jesus_, and\r\nthe _Gabriel Harfleur_ were rebuilt at Smalhithe, in Kent, but in years\r\nunknown. The hulls of several of the ships were sold or given away before\r\nthe end of the reign.\r\n\r\nAt one time the king seems to have commenced building abroad. There is\r\na letter of 25th April 1419 from John Alcetre, his agent at Bayonne,\r\ndescribing the slow progress of the work upon a ship there and the sharp\r\npractices of the mayor and his associates who appear to have undertaken\r\nthe contract. Alcetre anticipated that four or five years would elapse\r\nbefore its completion, and it is quite certain that it was never included\r\nin the English navy. The most noteworthy points in the details given,\r\nare the lengths over all and of the keel—respectively 186 and 112\r\nfeet—so that the fore and aft rakes, together, were 74 feet, just about\r\ntwo-thirds of the keel length.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry V:—The Grace Dieu.]\r\n\r\nThe only one of Henry’s ships of which the name is still remembered\r\nis the _Grace Dieu_, and she was, if not the largest, probably the\r\nbest equipped ship yet built in England. She was not constructed\r\nunder the superintendence of either Catton, the official head of the\r\nadministration, or of Soper, and with two balingers, the _Fawcon_ and\r\nthe _Valentine_, and some other work cost £4917, 15s 3½d.[25] Besides\r\nother wood 2591 oaks and 1195 beeches were used among the three vessels\r\nand for the various details mentioned, and it is to be remarked that,\r\nalthough the _Grace Dieu_ must have represented the latest improvements,\r\nshe, like the others, appears to have had only one ‘great mast’ and\r\none ‘mesan,’[26] but two bowsprits. These carried no sails and were\r\nprobably more of the nature of ‘bumpkins’ than spars. She was supplied\r\nwith six sails and eleven bonnets, but their position when in use is\r\nnot described, and some of them were perhaps spare ones. The order to\r\ncommence her was placed in Robert Berd’s hands in December 1416, when\r\nCatton was still keeper and Soper was engaged in naval administration. It\r\nwould appear to be entirely subversive of discipline and responsibility\r\nto distribute the control among three men, each of whom possessed\r\nsufficient position and independence to ensure friction, and we can only\r\nguess that the motive was pecuniary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Administration.]\r\n\r\nThe first keeper of the ships under Henry V was William Catton by Letters\r\nPatent of 18th July 1413, who from the third to the eighth year of the\r\nreign of Henry IV had been bailiff of Winchelsea, and who subsequently\r\nheld the bailiffship of Rye conjointly with his naval office. He was\r\nsucceeded from 3rd February 1420 by the before-mentioned William Soper.\r\nBerd’s name only occurs in connection with the _Grace Dieu_. The river\r\nHamble, on Southampton water, was then, and down to the close of the\r\ncentury, the favourite roadstead for the royal ships lying up, and\r\nwas defended at its entrance by a tower of wood which cost £40,[27] a\r\nstorehouse with a workshop[28] was also built at Southampton, and one\r\nexisted in London near the Tower. If the vessels were not built in royal\r\nyards or by royal workmen we may infer the control of a crown officer\r\nfrom the fact of a pension of fourpence a day having been granted, when\r\nbroken down in health, to John Hoggekyns, ‘master-carpenter of the king’s\r\nships,’ and builder of the _Grace Dieu_, the first known of the long line\r\nof master shipwrights reaching down to the present century.\r\n\r\nThe fittings of ships do not differ materially from those quoted by Sir\r\nN. H. Nicolas under Edward III; we find a ‘bitakyll’[29] covered with\r\nlead, and pumps were now in use. Cordage was chiefly from Bridport, but\r\noccasionally from Holland, and Oleron canvas was bought abroad. Flags\r\nwere of St Marie, St Edward, Holy Trinity, St George, the Swan, Antelope,\r\nOstrich Feathers, and the king’s arms. The _Trinity Royal_ had a painted\r\nwooden leopard with a crown of copper gilt, perhaps as a figure head.\r\nThe largest anchor of the _Jesus_ weighed 2224lb. The balingers, besides\r\nbeing fully rigged, carried sometimes forty or fifty oars, twenty-four\r\nfeet long apiece, for use in calms or to work to windward. But even a\r\nvessel like the _Trinity Royal_ had forty oars and a large one called\r\na ‘steering skull,’ to assist the rudder we may suppose. The fore and\r\nstern stages were now becoming permanent structures. Two ‘somerhuches’\r\nwere built on the _Holigost_ and _Trinity Royal_. Somerhuche was the\r\nsummer-castle or poop of the early sixteenth century, and the cost, £4,\r\n11s 3d, equivalent now to some £70, seems too great for a mere timber\r\nstaging.[30] Sails were sometimes decorated with the king’s arms or\r\nbadges, but probably only in the chief ships and for holiday use.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry VI:—The Sale of the Navy.]\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Henry V one of the first orders of the Council was\r\nto direct the sale of the bulk of the Royal Navy.[31] Modern writers\r\nwho hold that the spirit of the ‘Libel of English Policie’ was that\r\nrepresenting the ideas of the time must explain this startling contrast\r\nbetween fact and theory. The truth is that the ‘Libel’ described, not\r\nexisting conditions, but those that the writer desired should exist; the\r\nwhole poem is a lament over past glories and an exhortation to retrieve\r\nthe maritime position of the country, but the poet did not look at what\r\nlay behind a couple of victories at sea and the capture of Calais.[32]\r\nAfter the real triumphs of Henry V and the memories associated with\r\nEdward III, the state of things in the Channel doubtless appeared very\r\nevil, although they were hardly worse during the reign of Henry VI than\r\nwas usual, and not nearly so bad as under James I and Charles I. The poem\r\nwas really an attempt to obtain continuity in naval policy, a thing of\r\nwhich the meaning is, even now, scarcely understood, and which in 1436,\r\nwhen the man-at-arms was the ideal fighting unit, had as little chance\r\nof being accepted and carried out as though it had preached religious\r\ntoleration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Changed character of the Keeper’s appointment.]\r\n\r\nBy Letters Patent of 5th March 1423, William Soper, merchant of\r\nSouthampton, a collector of customs and subsidies at that port, and mayor\r\nof the town in 1416 and 1424, was again appointed ‘Keeper and Governor’\r\nof the King’s ships, under the control[33] of Nicholas Banastre,\r\ncomptroller of the customs there; no such clause existed in the patent of\r\n1420. For himself and a clerk Soper was allowed £40 a year, but Banastre\r\nwas not given any salary. The appointment is noteworthy for more than one\r\nreason. It is the first, and apparently the only, instance in which a\r\nkeeper of the ships acted under the supervision of another officer little\r\nhis superior in the official hierarchy, and it, with the previous patent\r\nof 1420, marks the commencement of a custom frequent enough afterwards\r\nof naming well-to-do merchants to posts in the administrative service of\r\nthe navy. Besides greater business capacity such a man was useful to the\r\ngovernment in that he was expected to advance money, or purchase stores,\r\non his own credit when the crown finance was temporarily strained.\r\nThere is little doubt that Soper’s appointment was of this character,\r\nand that his salary, was really by way of interest on money advanced by\r\nhim for the construction of the _Holigost_ and _Gabriel_, and for other\r\npurposes, years before. The first named ship was built in 1414, the\r\nother perhaps later, but it was not until 1430 that he received the sum\r\nwhich represented the final instalment of their cost.[34] By the will of\r\nHenry V the whole of his personal possessions were ordered to be sold\r\nand the proceeds handed over to his executors to pay his debts. They\r\nreceived, in 1430, one thousand marks from the sale of the men-of-war,\r\nthe remainder of the money obtained from this source being retained by\r\nSoper in settlement of his claims dating from 1414.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Navy a personal possession of the King.]\r\n\r\nThe transaction is interesting both as showing that the Council did not\r\nconsider the men-of-war—if compulsorily put up to auction under the\r\nwill—of sufficient importance to buy in, and as illustrating the fact\r\nthat the royal ships were personal possessions of the sovereign in which\r\nthe nation had no interest of ownership. Tunnage and poundage had been\r\ngranted for ‘the safe keeping of the sea,’ but the application of the\r\nmoney was at the discretion of the king. He might use it to pay hired\r\nmerchantmen or he might build ships of his own with it, or with the\r\nrevenue of the crown estates to fulfil the same purpose; in neither case\r\nhad Parliament any voice in the employment of the money. While calling\r\nupon the Cinque Ports to fulfil the conditions of their charters and\r\nimpressing merchant ships throughout the country, he might keep his\r\nown navy idle; there was no national right to profit by its existence.\r\nThe tunnage and poundage grant did not interfere with the king’s title\r\nto seize every ship in the kingdom, and was only an attempt to secure\r\npayment to owners, and the wages and victualling of the crews; it in no\r\nway placed upon him the responsibility of providing ships, the supply\r\nof which was ensured by the unrestricted exercise of the prerogative,\r\nand that prerogative was not used any less frequently because of the\r\nexistence of the tunnage and poundage. As years passed on and the power\r\nof the trading classes increased, and the need for specialised fighting\r\nships grew greater, they made their ethical right to the use of the\r\nnavy for ordinary purposes felt in practice and implicitly recognised\r\nby the crown. Hence the distinction became less and less marked but the\r\nnote of possessive separation between the ‘King’s Navy Royal’ and the\r\ntrading navy which was, legally, also the king’s and is so referred to\r\nin sixteenth century papers, is to be traced to as late as 1649. Since\r\nthat date the title ‘Royal Navy,’ although associated with our proudest\r\nnational memories is, historically, a misnomer as applied to the navy of\r\nthe state.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Piracy.]\r\n\r\nIn 1425, Parliament raised tunnage and poundage to three shillings on\r\nthe tun of wine and one shilling in the pound on merchandise, at which\r\nrate it continued. Probably very little of it was applied to the specific\r\npurpose for which it was given, the struggle for the crown of France\r\nabsorbing every available item of revenue for the support of armies; in\r\n1450 one of the articles against the Duke of Suffolk was that he had\r\ncaused money given for the defence of the realm and safety of the sea\r\nto be otherwise employed. There still remains a sufficient number of\r\ncomplaints and petitions to show to what little purpose our maritime\r\nforces were used. In 1432, the Commons formally declared that Danish\r\nships had plundered those of Hull, to the amount of £5000, and others\r\nto £20,000 in one year, and requested that letters of reprisal might\r\nbe issued.[35] Such attempts to clear the Channel as the government\r\nrecognised sometimes bore a suspicious resemblance to piracy legalised\r\nby success. In 1435, Wm. Morfote of Winchelsea petitioned for a pardon,\r\nhaving been, as he euphemistically put it, ‘in Dover Castle a long time\r\nand afterward come oute as wele as he myghte,’ and then, ‘of his gode\r\nhertly intente,’ had been at sea with 100 men to attack the king’s\r\nenemies. He found it difficult to obtain provisions which seems to have\r\nbeen his only motive in asking for a pardon. The answer to the petition,\r\nwhile granting the pardon for ‘an esy fyne,’ more plainly calls him an\r\nescaped prisoner.[36] He was member for Winchelsea in 1428.\r\n\r\nAlthough Parliament was continually complaining of foreign piracy there\r\ncan be no doubt that English seamen had nothing to learn, in that\r\noccupation, from their rivals. ‘Your shipping you employ to make war upon\r\nthe poor merchants and to plunder and rob them of their merchandise,\r\nand you make yourselves plunderers and pirates,’ said a contemporary\r\nwriter.[37] By a statute[38] of Henry V, the breaking of truce and safe\r\nconduct was made high treason, and a conservator of safe conducts, who\r\nwas to be a person of position enjoying not less than £40 in land by the\r\nyear, was to be appointed in every port. Under Henry VI, safe conducts\r\nwere freely granted to neutrals to load goods in enemies’ ships, and\r\nprotests were made by the Commons about their number and that they were\r\nnot enrolled of record in the court of chancery and so led to loss and\r\nlitigation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry VI:—Merchant Shipping.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the normal drawbacks of piracy and warfare, the over-sea\r\ntrade of the kingdom seems to have been steadily expanding. A branch\r\nof traffic which employed many vessels, and must have been a valuable\r\nschool of preparation for the longer voyages of the next generation, was\r\nwhat may be called, the pilgrim transport trade. The shrine of St James\r\nof Compostella was then the favourite objective of English external\r\npilgrimage and there are innumerable licenses to shipowners to carry\r\npassengers out and home. In 1427-8 twenty-two licenses were granted, and\r\nin 1433-4 the number reached 65;[39] in 1445, 2100 persons were carried\r\nthere and back.[40] Some of the licenses were granted to Soper, who was\r\nengaged in the business as well as in ordinary trade to Spain, and it\r\nis to be remarked that they were sometimes issued during the winter\r\nmonths—January, February, March,—showing that English seamanship was\r\noutgrowing the tradition of summer voyages. In 1449 we have the first\r\nsign of the bounty system on merchant ships of large size which, in the\r\nnext century, systematised into five shillings a ton for those of 100\r\ntons and upwards. John Taverner of Hull, had built the _Grace Dieu_, and\r\nin that year, was allowed certain privileges in connexion with lading the\r\nvessel in reward for his enterprise.[41] The document seems to imply that\r\nshe was a new ship, but in 1444-5, she was exempted from the harbour dues\r\nat Calais because drawing too much water to enter the harbour,[42] and is\r\nprobably referred to in 1442.[43]\r\n\r\nThere are two most valuable papers still existing which enable us to\r\nform some idea of the number and size of the merchantmen available\r\nfor the service of the crown. The first of June 1439[44] is a list of\r\npayments for ships taken up for the transport of troops to Aquitaine,\r\nand is unfortunately mutilated in some places.

It must be remembered that\r\nthey are not schedules of the total available reserves drawn up during\r\na naval war, with an enemy’s fleet at sea, or under the pressure of a\r\nthreatened invasion, but merely represent the number of vessels required\r\nto transport a certain military force, and form only a proportion—whether\r\nlarge or small we know not—of the maritime strength of the country.\r\nCertainly the numbers for Bristol did not represent the total resources\r\nof that city, and Newcastle and Yarmouth, to name only two flourishing\r\nports, do not occur in either list. Assuming the method of tonnage\r\nmeasurement to have been the same during the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies we have here registers which will compare favourably, both in\r\nnumber and size of vessels, with those of the earlier twenty years of\r\nthe reign of Elizabeth,[49] and imply a naval force superior in extent\r\nto anything existing during the greater part of the sixteenth century.\r\nThere is contemporary evidence from a French author, one therefore not\r\nlikely to be more than just to England, as to the flourishing condition\r\nof the merchant marine during the reign of Henry VI.[50] The author makes\r\nthe English herald claim that his countrymen ‘are more richly and amply\r\nprovided at sea, with fine and powerful ships than any other nation of\r\nChristendom, so that they are kings of the sea, since none can resist\r\nthem; and they who are strongest on the sea may call themselves kings.’\r\nThe answer of the French herald, too long to quote, after admitting that\r\n‘you have a great number of fine ships,’ is only devoted to showing that\r\nFrance possesses all the natural advantages which go to the formation of\r\nmaritime power, and that the French king, ‘when he pleases,’ would become\r\nsupreme at sea. Obviously down to the time of the loss of the English\r\nconquests in France, and the outbreak of the wars of the Roses, the wave\r\nof prosperity which commenced with the century had not altogether spent\r\nits force.\r\n\r\nGreat or small, the progress was, at anyrate, not a bounty-fed one, since\r\nshipowners were experiencing the usual difficulties in obtaining payment\r\nmerely for the use of their vessels. The bill for ships provided in 1450,\r\ncame to £13,000, nearly one fourth of the yearly revenue of the crown,\r\nbut the Treasury, exhausted by the ceaseless demands made upon it by the\r\ngarrisons in France could not pay.[51] The king, therefore, appealed to\r\nhis creditors and has left it on record that as £13,000 was a sum\r\n\r\n    ‘Wyche myght not esely be perveyed at that tyme wherefore\r\n    we comauded oure trusty and welbelovid Richard Greyle of\r\n    London and others to labour and entrete the seyd maistres,\r\n    possessores, and maryners for agrement of a lasse sume, the\r\n    wych maistres, possessores, and maryners by laboar and trete\r\n    made with hem accordyng to our seid comaundement agreed hem to\r\n    take and reseve the sume of £6,200 in and for ful contentacyon\r\n    of their seid dutees; and bycause the seid £6,200 myght not at\r\n    that tyme esely be ffurnysshed in redy mony we graunted to ye\r\n    seid maistres and possessores by oure several letters patentes\r\n    conteynyng diveise sumys of money amountyng to the sume of\r\n    £2,884 that they, their deputees or attornies shold have to\r\n    reseyve in theire owne handes almaner of custumes and subsidies\r\n    of wolle, wollefell and other merchaundises comyng into dyverse\r\n    portes.’[52]\r\n\r\nThis was perhaps all they obtained of the £13,000, and such incidents, of\r\nwhich this was doubtless only one, explain the discontent of the trading\r\nclasses with the house of Lancaster. Shipowners and merchants might be\r\ntrusted, in the long run, to take care of their own interests, but the\r\nseamen were more helpless, and it may be supposed that if employers had\r\nto accept less than a fourth of their dues the men did not fare better\r\nif as well. Their protests were sometimes neither tardy nor voiceless.\r\nThe murder of Bishop Adam de Moleyns at Portsmouth on July 9, 1450, is\r\ndirectly attributed to an attempt to force sailors to accept a smaller\r\namount than they had earned, and the bias towards the house of York,\r\nshown by the maritime population generally, may be ascribed to this cause.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry VI:—The Royal Ships hired out.]\r\n\r\nHenry V had not considered it beneath the dignity of the crown to hire\r\nout his ships to merchants for voyages to Bordeaux and elsewhere when\r\nthey were not required for service; the Council of Regency, therefore\r\ndid not hesitate to follow the same course. In 1423 the _Holigost_ was\r\nlent to some Lombard merchants for a journey to Zealand and back for\r\n£20; and the _Valentine_ from Southampton to Calais for £10.[53] As the\r\n_Holigost_ was of 760 tons a rate of £300, in modern values, or about\r\neight shillings a ton for a voyage probably occupying nearly two months,\r\ncannot be considered excessive, and does not imply any great fear of sea\r\nrisks, whether from man or the elements.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And sold.]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, in virtue of the Council order of March 3, 1423, the\r\ndestruction of a navy progressed merrily. During 1423 the following\r\nvessels were sold to merchants of London, Dartmouth, Bristol,\r\nSouthampton, and Plymouth, and, from the prices, many of them must have\r\nbeen in good condition[54]:—\r\n\r\n    _George_ (Carrack),           £133   6  8\r\n    _George_ (Balinger),            20   0  0\r\n    _Christopher_,                 166  13  4\r\n    _Katrine Breton_ (Balinger),    20   0  0\r\n    _Thomas_,                      133   6  8\r\n    _Grande Marie_,                200   0  0\r\n    _Holigost_ (Spayne),           200   0  0\r\n    _Nicholas_,                     76  13  4\r\n    _Swan_,                         18   0  0\r\n    _Cracchere_,                    26  13  4\r\n    _Fawcon_,                       50   0  0\r\n\r\nAnchors and other stores were sold and, in 1424, the storehouse and\r\nforge at Southampton went for £66, 13s 4d; if there were to be no ships\r\nthere was certainly no reason to keep up any establishment for their\r\nrepairs. In the same year eight other vessels, mostly described as\r\nworn out, followed their sisters. They were sold for very low prices\r\nand the description of their state may be exact, although two at least\r\nwere nearly new, and what we know of administrative methods in later\r\ntimes does not warrant an implicit faith, especially under a Council of\r\nRegency. When a 550 ton ship, like the _Marie Sandwich_, brought only\r\n£13, it must be assumed that she was almost worthless even for breaking\r\nup, or that the proceedings were not devoid of collusion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry VI:—Subsequent Naval Administration.]\r\n\r\nWe have no record of the expenditure for the first years of Henry’s reign\r\nbut, from 31st August 1427 to 31st August 1433, the sum of £809, 10s 2d\r\nwas spent by Soper for naval purposes, being an average of £134, 18s 4d\r\na year.[55] The _Trinity Royal_, _Holigost_, _Grace Dieu_, and _Jesus_\r\nwere still in existence, but dismantled and unrigged at Bursledon.\r\nApparently there were no officers attached to them, or at Southampton,\r\nof sufficient experience to assume responsibility, since Peter Johnson,\r\nmaster mariner of Sandwich, was paid for coming to superintend the\r\nremoval of the masts of the _Grace Dieu_. The _Trinity Royal_ was so far\r\nunseaworthy and useless as to be imbedded in the mud of the river Hamble,\r\nand fifteen Genoese and other foreign master mariners were employed about\r\ndismasting her. There seems at this time to have been some purpose of\r\nrebuilding the _Jesus_, because she was taken to a dock lately prepared\r\nat Southampton, and, of the whole amount before mentioned, £165, 6s 10d\r\nwas laid out in unrigging her, towing to Southampton, expenses of dock,\r\netc. As the sails and stores of the vessels sold in 1423-4 were still\r\nunder Soper’s care, a new storehouse, 160 feet long and 14 feet broad,\r\nwas built at Southampton. That at London had not been closed in 1423,\r\npossibly because it may have been within the precincts of the Tower, and\r\nmuch of the equipment of the four great ships still remaining was kept in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nDuring the four years ending with the 31st August 1437, £96, 0s 2½d was\r\nreceived from the Exchequer and £72, 1s 6d from the sale of cordage,\r\netc., belonging to the ships;[56] the expenditure was £143, 6s 5¾d. For\r\nthe two years ending 31st August 1439, the outlay on the Royal Navy was\r\n£8, 9s 7d. The ‘Libel of English Policie,’ which is now held to have\r\nrepresented the views of the governing statesmen was therefore given to\r\nthe world when the estimates for the crown navy averaged £4, 4s 6½d a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nEconomy had been further exercised by the discharge of the shipkeepers\r\nas superfluous, and possibly one of the results of this careful thrift\r\nwas the destruction of the _Grace Dieu_ by fire, while lying on the mud\r\nat Bursledon, during the night of the 7th January 1439.[57] Some loose\r\nfittings were saved and 15,400lbs. of iron recovered from the burnt\r\nwreck. Soper’s next account, from 31st August 1439, ends on 7th April\r\n1442, during which time he received £3, 10s from the Exchequer and £3, 0s\r\n11¾d for 1222lbs. of lead from the ships. The disbursements were £4, 16s\r\n4d, chiefly incurred in breaking up the cabins[58] on the _Trinity Royal_\r\nand _Holigost_ and taking away the timber; the _Jesus_ appears to have\r\nbeen too far perished to experience even this fate.[59]\r\n\r\nFrom 7th April 1442, Soper was succeeded by Richard Clyvedon, a yeoman\r\nof the crown[60] by Letters Patent, dated 26th March 1442, but at the\r\nsmaller fee of one shilling a day which had been received by Soper’s\r\npredecessors. In all probability Soper’s salary was very irregularly, if\r\nat all paid, and an official outlay which averaged some £1, 10s a year,\r\noffered few opportunities in the way of perquisites to a prosperous\r\nmerchant. For five years and ninety days, from 7th April 1442 until 6th\r\nJuly 1447, the receipts were £61, 2s 7d, all from the sale of stores\r\noriginally belonging to the vessels sold in 1423-4; no expenses of any\r\nsort had to be met since the bare hulks of the _Jesus_, _Trinity_, and\r\n_Holigost_, still existing were left to take care of themselves.[61] The\r\nnext and last accounts continue for the following four years and nine\r\nmonths to the 7th April 1452, when they cease. The amount received was\r\n£73, 11s 4½d, again altogether from the sale of stores; the expenditure\r\nwas £16, 12s 10d, mostly referable to the cost of a chain fixed across\r\nthe Hamble.[62] As only the rotting hulls of the _Trinity_ and _Holigost_\r\nnow remained, it is difficult to estimate its value so far as they were\r\nconcerned, but for the first time for nearly forty years, there were now\r\nfears of French reprisals.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry VI:—The Substitutes of the Navy.]\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be supposed that because the Royal Navy was not\r\nkept up, no measures were taken to protect maritime interests. The\r\npredecessors of Henry V had employed a combination of royal and impressed\r\nships; Henry V apparently intended to increase the crown navy until\r\nit was powerful enough to enable him to rely on it for every purpose\r\nbut that of transport. Rightly or wrongly the Protector and Council\r\nadopted a different system and one which was continued through all the\r\npolitical changes of the reign. Instead of keeping up a royal force, or\r\nof pressing ships and placing them under the crown officers, indentures\r\nwere entered into now and again with certain persons supposed to be\r\ncompetent to provide under their own command an agreed number of ships\r\nand men to keep the sea for a specified time. In favour of this plan it\r\nwas perhaps argued that it was cheaper than any other, and that it should\r\nprove sufficiently effective as the coast of France was either in English\r\noccupation or belonged to a neutral or ally in the Duke of Brittany,\r\nand that an expensive Royal Navy was unnecessary when a French navy was\r\nimpossible and only the ordinary rovers of the sea had to be met and\r\ndestroyed. Against it might be urged that, besides the delay inevitable\r\nto the process of collecting merchantmen at a given _rendezvous_, it was\r\nthe object of the persons undertaking the work to make a profit on the\r\nbargain and that they would probably minimise effort, time, and expense,\r\nas much as practicable. So far as the scanty evidence enables us to judge\r\nit is possible that, until the loss of the French coastline, the plan,\r\nhad it been carried on under the authoritative supervision of an able\r\nand honest crown official, might have worked successfully. Doubtless the\r\neconomy promised was the final argument because, once the Royal Navy\r\nhad been suffered to perish, there was never throughout the reign any\r\nfinancial possibility of restoring it. By 1433 the royal expenses were\r\nnearly double the revenue; and the Lord Treasurer, Cromwell, told the\r\nKing, ‘nowe daily many warrantis come to me of paiementes ... of moche\r\nmore than all youre revenus wold come to thowe they wer not assigned\r\nafore; whereas hit aperith by your bokes of record which have been\r\nshowed that they have been assigned nygh for this eleven yeere next\r\nfolowyng.’[63]\r\n\r\nAs many of the debts of Henry V for hire of ships and men’s wages were\r\nstill unpaid, the conditions were evidently not favourable to the direct\r\naction of the crown either in replacing its own navy or taking ships into\r\npay. An intermediary of recognised position to whom a payment was usually\r\nat once made on account, doubtless inspired more confidence in owners and\r\nmen. Although not the first in point of time, the commission of Sir John\r\nSpeke by an agreement of 2nd May 1440, is noticeable in that the service\r\nwas apparently the first in which the men were paid and victualled at a\r\nweekly rate, one and sixpence a week wages and the same for victuals.[64]\r\nFor at least two centuries the rate had been threepence a day, with\r\nusually an additional sixpence a week ‘reward,’ and this reduction of\r\npay seems to imply that there were plenty of men to be obtained. In\r\n1442 the Commons themselves arranged the period—2nd February to 11th\r\nNovember—during which a fleet was to be at sea, and even designated the\r\nships which were to serve, together with the allowances to officers and\r\nmen.[65] There were to be eight ships, all merchantmen, manned by 1200\r\nmen, and each of the eight was to be attended by a barge and balinger\r\nhaving respectively 80 and 40 men apiece. There were also four pinnaces.\r\nOne of the ships is the _Nicholas of the Tower_ of Bristol. ‘Of the\r\nTower’ was the man-of-war mark, and this is the only one found in the\r\nlists of merchantmen of the century. The _Nicholas of the Tower_ of Henry\r\nV was sold to some purchasers belonging to Dartmouth, but may have passed\r\ninto Bristol ownership. It was the crew of this vessel, usually described\r\nas a man-of-war, who seized and executed the Duke of Suffolk on his\r\npassage to Flanders when exiled in 1450.\r\n\r\nThe seamen’s pay, two shillings a month, if not an error of entry,\r\ncan only be explained by the expectation of a liberal division of\r\nprize-money, one half of which was to be shared among masters,\r\nquartermasters, soldiers and sailors. The other half was divided\r\ninto thirds, of which two went to the owners and one to the captains\r\nand under-captains. The victualling was now one and twopence a week.\r\nThe captains and under-captains were military officers; there was no\r\nship-captain in the modern sense although the master, whose pay was\r\nsixpence a day, was his nearest equivalent. The conditions were beginning\r\nto slowly change during this century, but hitherto the fighting had been\r\ndone on board ship by the soldiers embarked for the purpose. The duty\r\nof the sailors, whether officers or men, was only to handle the vessel\r\nat sea or in action. The fleet does not appear to have put to sea till\r\nAugust, although the undertakers, Sir William Ewe, Miles Stapylton, and\r\nJohn Heron, were receiving money for its preparation in June.[66] In 1445\r\nthe charges for the passage of Margaret of Anjou when she came to share\r\nthe crown do not show the same tendency to lower wages; masters were\r\nstill paid sixpence a day, but the men received one and ninepence a week\r\nand their sixpence ‘reward,’ and pages (boys) one and three halfpence\r\na week.[67] During the winter of 1444-5 a Cinque Ports squadron was\r\nin commission from September to the following April, and this must be\r\nalmost the last instance of the performance of the ancient service of the\r\nports in a complete manner. Twenty-six vessels were provided—four from\r\nHastings, seven from Winchelsea, four from Rye, Lydd, and Romney, two\r\nfrom Hythe, three from Dover, five from Sandwich, and one from Faversham,\r\nnumbers which perhaps indicate the relative importance of the towns at\r\nthis time. The whole cost of the fleet was only £672, 9s 1½d, while\r\nMargaret’s journey was considered worth £1810, 9s 7½d.[68] The tonnage\r\nof the Cinque Ports vessels is not given, but that they were of no great\r\nsize may be inferred from the small number of men in each.\r\n\r\nIn 1449 Alexander Eden and Gervays Clifton, afterwards Treasurer of\r\nCalais, were entrusted with the care of the Channel and, although their\r\ndeeds have left no mark in history, they were considered so satisfactory\r\nat the time that, in the following year, Clifton was granted a special\r\nreward of four hundred marks for his good service. In 1450 Clifton and\r\nEden were again performing the same duty and, in 1452, Clifton and\r\nSir Edward Hull. Certainly there was now every reason for redoubled\r\nvigilance. Between 1449 and 1451 the English Conquests in France had\r\ngone like a dream; only Calais was left, and that was considered to be\r\nimminently threatened. Notwithstanding loans, mortgages of revenues, and\r\nmoney obtained by pawning the crown jewels, the government owed £372,000,\r\nwhile the receipts from the crown estates were not more than £5000 a\r\nyear, and the yearly charge of the household alone was £23,000. If we\r\nadd to these facts a saintly king, and an inefficient government, the\r\nfirst mutterings of the storm of civil war, and a foe, exhausted it is\r\ntrue, but eager for vengeance, we are able to partly picture the extent\r\nof the losses in honour and prosperity which made one of the first acts\r\nof the Duke of York, when created Protector on 27th March 1454, the\r\nappointment of a fresh commission to guard the seas. On the following\r\n3rd April, the tunnage and poundage for three years was assigned to the\r\nEarls of Salisbury, Shrewsbury, Wiltshire, Worcester, and Oxford, the\r\nLords Stourton and Fitzwalter, and Sir Robert Vere, for that purpose.[69]\r\nThat immediate action might be taken a loan of £1000 was raised in the\r\nproportions of London £300, Bristol £150, Southampton £100, Norwich and\r\nYarmouth £100, Ipswich, Colchester and Malden £100, York and Hull £100,\r\nNew Sarum, Poole and Weymouth £50, Lynn £50, Boston £30, and Newcastle\r\n£20, to be repaid out of the tunnage and poundage.[70]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry VI:—The Civil War.]\r\n\r\nIn 1455, the first battle of St Albans was fought and there was no\r\nfurther question of naval matters until Edward IV was on the throne.\r\nNaval power appears to have had but little influence on the result of\r\nthe wars of the Roses, nor, except at one moment, is the command of the\r\nsea shown to be a factor of any great importance in the struggle. Such\r\nas it was the Yorkists possessed it, as owners and seamen both affected\r\nthe white Rose, but the Lancastrians seem never to have experienced\r\nany difficulty in obtaining necessary shipping, when in power on land,\r\nduring the years of war. In 1459, however, when York fled to Ireland,\r\nand Warwick to Calais, the attachment the seamen generally felt for\r\nthe latter enabled him to hold his own there and in the Channel, which\r\nperhaps had no inconsiderable influence on the final issue. The naval\r\nweakness of the Lancastrians compelled them, instead of protecting the\r\nEnglish coasts off the French ports, to issue commissions to array the\r\n_posse comitatus_ in the maritime counties to repel invasion, and the\r\nsack of Sandwich in 1457, by the Seneschal de Brézé was an outcome of the\r\nchanged conditions. But Warwick’s fight on 29th May 1458, with a fleet of\r\nSpanish ships of more than double his strength, and his capture of six\r\nof them, though little better than open piracy, was a sharp reminder that\r\nEnglish seamen had not lost the spirit which animated their fathers, and,\r\nunder the right conditions could still emulate their deeds.[71]\r\n\r\nUnless the merchant marine had degenerated very rapidly there must have\r\nstill been plenty of seagoing ships available in English ports, but\r\nthe subjoined Treasury warrant perhaps indicates the difficulty the\r\nLancastrians experienced in chartering ships and obtaining men. On 5th\r\nApril 1460, Henry was once more king and his adversaries in exile, and an\r\norder of that date directs the officials of the Exchequer that ‘of suche\r\nmoney as is lent unto us by oure trewe subgittes for keping of the see\r\nand othire causes ye do paye to Julyan Cope capitaigne of a carake of\r\nVenise nowe beinge in the Tamyse £100 for a moneth, and to Julyan Ffeso\r\ncapitayne of a nother carrake of Jeane[72] being at Sandwich £105 for a\r\nmoneth the which two carrakes be entretid to doo us service.’ This is\r\nof course not conclusive because foreign vessels were at times hired by\r\nall our kings although English ships were available. But in June 1460\r\nthe Lancastrian Duke of Exeter, with a superior force, met Warwick at\r\nsea, but did not venture to attack him, being unable to trust his men.\r\nIf, therefore, the men were not reliable there was good reason for the\r\nemployment of foreigners.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry VI:—Results of the Contract System.]\r\n\r\nAdministering the navy by contract had been tried and found wanting; it\r\nhad never been resorted to before and was never used again. It had proved\r\nexpensive and ineffective. There can be little doubt that had one half\r\nthe money wasted in spasmodic efforts been devoted to the maintenance of\r\na small but efficient royal force, always ready for action, the results,\r\nif less profitable to the intermediaries, would have been better for the\r\nnation. But before all and above all, whatever plan was adopted, there\r\nwas necessary the hand to control and the brain to govern. The military\r\norganisation had been systematised for centuries and would go on working\r\nmore or less easily whatever the personal qualities of the ruler. The\r\nNavy was not yet to the same extent an organised and permanent force, and\r\nits strength in any reign was still dependent on the initiative of the\r\nsovereign. Henry obtained canonisation at the expense of the lives and\r\nprosperity of his subjects, of his followers, and of his son. It had been\r\nbetter for them if he had possessed more of the sinful strength of a man\r\nand less of the flaccid virtue of a saint.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry VI:—Docks, etc.]\r\n\r\nThere is nothing known positively of any improvements in the form or\r\nequipments of ships during this reign. There are no inventories in detail\r\nbetween the time of Henry V and the first years of Henry VII. But while\r\nin the first quarter of the fifteenth century we find that men-of-war\r\npossess, at the most, two masts and two sails, carry three or four guns,\r\nand one or two rudimentary bowsprits, at the close of the same century\r\nthey are three or four masters with topmasts and topsails, bowsprit and\r\nspritsail, and conforming to the characteristics and type which remained\r\ngenerally constant for more than two centuries. It is quite certain that\r\nno sudden transition occurred; the changes came slowly with the passing\r\nyears, but they have left no traces in the records. Whether docks were\r\nused in England before the fifteenth century may be doubtful, but the\r\nword is in common use in the reign of Henry V, although it did not denote\r\nwhat we now understand by such a structure. Its derivation from the Low\r\nLatin _Diga_ a ditch, more exactly indicates its character, but the word\r\nwas employed in more than one sense, and even after the construction\r\nof the first dry dock at Portsmouth in 1496, we find in the sixteenth\r\ncentury an arrangement of timber round a ship in the Thames, to protect\r\nher from the ice, called a dock. The _Nomenclator Navalis_ of 1625\r\ndescribes a wet dock as ‘any creek or place where we may cast in a ship\r\nout of the tideway in the ooze, and then when a ship hath made herself\r\n(as it were) a place to lie in we say the ship hath docked herself,’ a\r\ndescription which much more nearly portrays the dock of the fifteenth\r\ncentury than the dry dock of to-day. The following details of a dock for\r\nthe _Grace Dieu_ in July 1434 are perhaps the fullest to be found, and\r\nare taken from Soper’s accounts for that year:—[73]\r\n\r\n    ‘And in money paid Thomas at Hythe, and 29 men labourers, for\r\n    working about, making and constructing anew[74] of a fence\r\n    called a hedge,[75] by the advice and ordinance of discreet and\r\n    wise mariners, that is to say on the Wose,[76] near Brisselden\r\n    aforesaid for the safe keeping and government of the King’s\r\n    ship, and to the putting out and drying up of the sea water\r\n    strongly running from the said King’s ship because the same\r\n    is weak: and also that the said King’s ship may be kept more\r\n    safely and easily in its said bed[77] called dok within the\r\n    said enclosure; taking for this work made and built by the\r\n    said ——[78] by agreement with him made in gross for the King’s\r\n    advantage the said month of July 12th year xxviiiˢ viᵈ. And\r\n    in money paid John Osmond, mariner, working about towing and\r\n    bringing timber and branches with his two boats for the service\r\n    of the same fence called an hegge[79] and there about the same\r\n    employed iiˢ. And in money paid to the said Thomas at Hythe\r\n    and to 29 other men his fellows for labouring and watching in\r\n    the said ship of the King’s about towing and conducting the\r\n    same from the same Brisselden where first she was in mooring\r\n    and in rode to the said enclosure called Dok, and there to the\r\n    placing, directing and guarding of the said ship of the King’s\r\n    within its bed called Dok, and to the attending on the safe\r\n    custody and superintendence of the same for three days, working\r\n    day and night, besides expenses of victualling, taking for this\r\n    work and occupation for the time aforesaid by agreement with\r\n    him in that cause made in the King’s service in gross the month\r\n    and year aforesaid xˢ.’\r\n\r\nIt may be inferred from this that the ship was brought to a suitable spot\r\nat a spring tide, possibly hauled still further aground by mechanical\r\nmeans, and when she had bedded herself, surrounded by timber and\r\nbrushwood, perhaps puddled with clay. It will be seen[80] that in 1496\r\na drydock, the first known to have been made in England was constructed\r\nat Portsmouth, but we are without knowledge of the intermediate steps,\r\nor whether there were no intervening improvements, and the dock at\r\nPortsmouth copied in its completeness from one already existing abroad.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Measurement of Tonnage.]\r\n\r\nIt has been pointed out that the value of the comparison between\r\nfifteenth and sixteenth century ships depends greatly on the method of\r\nmeasuring tonnage, and on that subject we have unfortunately but little\r\ninformation. The Bordeaux wine trade was the earliest, and for two\r\ncenturies one of the most important branches of English maritime traffic;\r\nships were therefore measured by their carrying capacity in Bordeaux\r\ncask. The first arithmetical rule for calculating a ship’s tonnage was\r\ndevised in 1582, and that rule made the net or cask tonnage nearly the\r\nsame as the average cargo. The unit of measurement was therefore the\r\ntun of wine in two butts of 252 gallons which in 1626 were estimated to\r\noccupy 60 cubic feet of space. The ancient wine gallon occupies 231 cubic\r\ninches and a tun measures strictly therefore only 33¹¹⁄₁₆ cubic feet,\r\nbut the reckoning is by butts, and much waste of space must be allowed\r\nfor in view of the usual shape of a cask. In 1626 certain experiments\r\ndescribed on a later page were carried out on the _Adventure_ of Ipswich,\r\nand it was found that while her burden in Bordeaux cask was 207 tons net,\r\nand 276 gross,[81] her tonnage by the Elizabethan rule was again almost\r\nexactly the same. If, in the fifteenth century, the shipper allowed 60\r\ncubic feet for two butts of wine, and the allowance of 1626 was doubtless\r\nthe outcome of long experience, there could have been but little\r\ndifference between the ship of Henry VI, and indeed of earlier reigns,\r\nand that of the period of Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Edward IV:—General Policy.]\r\n\r\nThere is even less material for the naval history of the reigns of Edward\r\nIV and Richard III than for that of Henry VI; if, as is probable, a naval\r\nadministration existed, no records have come down to us. Edward seized\r\nthe crown on 4th March 1461, but it was not until after the battle of\r\nTewkesbury in 1471 that he could consider himself really and indubitably\r\nking. The uncertainty of his position during the intervening ten years\r\nmust have prevented the systematic organisation of a naval department,\r\nbut he was not remiss in, so far as was possible, holding the command\r\nof the Channel. Doubtless his experience with Warwick at Calais in 1459\r\nhad taught him its importance. Not long after Towton, an English fleet\r\nunder the command of the Earls of Essex and Kent ravaged the coast of\r\nBrittany in revenge for the sympathy shown to Margaret by the reigning\r\nDuke. In 1462 another fleet was at sea, but we have no details of its\r\naction, although it was no doubt fitted for service to anticipate or deal\r\nwith Margaret’s landing at Bamborough in October. An agreement dated 1st\r\nFebruary 1462, placed naval affairs under the control of the Earl of\r\nWarwick for three years, the Earl’s salary being £1000 a year.[82] If\r\nEdward’s experience in 1459 had instructed him in the significance of\r\nthe command of Calais and the fleet, he may not have willingly appointed\r\nhis powerful subject to a position which made the latter practically\r\nindependent of the crown; it may be, however, that he had little choice,\r\nand that Warwick’s power in the country, and his popularity with the\r\nseamen made his nomination almost a matter of necessity.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this indenture made with Warwick we find that in\r\nJuly 1463 the Earl of Worcester was in charge of naval matters, and,\r\nin August, that nobleman is described as ‘captain and keeper of the\r\nsea.’[83] Warwick may have resigned or may have constituted Worcester\r\nhis deputy. A later paper[84] tells us that Worcester acted by Letters\r\nPatent of 30th June 1463. This would not clear Warwick’s term of office\r\nbut in any case these appointments of Warwick, or of Worcester, or of\r\nboth, appear to have been the last survivals of the custom of putting the\r\nsafeguard of the seas out to contract. And the survival was more due to\r\npolitical conditions than to any intention or desire of renewing the old\r\nsystem. The name of Richard Clyvedon, who succeeded Soper as clerk of the\r\nships in 1442, disappears after a few years; as no payments were made\r\neven for his salary, it may be assumed that he either died, resigned, or\r\nwas dismissed, and the post was not filled up. Under the circumstances\r\nthere was no use for a clerk of the ships as the contractors who engaged\r\nto provide ships and men would prefer to employ their own servants to\r\nmanage the details. In 1465 Piers Bowman is referred to as ‘clerk of our\r\nshippes,’ but his patent is not to be found nor any payments by way of\r\nsalary, and the document in question[85] is the only one in which his\r\noccupancy of the office is mentioned. Three years later, in 1468, Sir\r\nJohn Howard, afterwards Duke of Norfolk, was entrusted with the payments\r\ndue for the passage of Edward’s sister Margaret on her marriage with\r\nCharles of Burgundy. Howard possessed ships of his own, and on 27th\r\nAugust 1470, received twenty marks on account of the victualling of two\r\nships which he had equipped ‘to take certaine rovers that lie in the\r\nTamyse mouth or there aboute, and robbe bothe the kinges subgittes and\r\nfrendes.’ This was little more than a fortnight before Warwick landed at\r\nDartmouth and shows how little Edward feared the Earl, for he made no\r\npreparation to intercept his passage, and his care, even in his uncertain\r\nposition, of the commercial interests of his subjects.[86] All through\r\nthe second civil war, Warwick retained the command of the Channel, nor\r\ndoes Edward, whether from indifference or inability, appear to have\r\nmade any attempt to wrest it from him. He relied for assistance chiefly\r\non the Burgundian navy, of which Philip de Comines says that it was so\r\npowerful that ‘no man durst stir in the narrow seas for fear of it.’ By\r\na navy, however, De Comines must be understood as meaning the general\r\nshipping strength of the state. Even after Tewkesbury Edward was once\r\nmore reminded that supremacy on land was only possible to the ruler who\r\ncontrolled the sea. The bastard of Fauconberg,[87] Warwick’s subordinate\r\nand in command of his fleet, seized the Thames and raised Kent and Essex;\r\nhad there been any Lancastrian power able to support him Edward’s newly\r\nregained crown would have been once more in jeopardy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Edward IV:—The Keeper of the Ships.]\r\n\r\nBy Letters Patent of 12th December 1480, the office of clerk of the\r\nships was once more reconstituted in the person of Thomas Rogers, with\r\na salary of one shilling and sixpence a day for himself and a clerk,\r\nand two shillings a day for travelling expenses, when employed on the\r\nking’s service. In later patents Rogers is described as a citizen and\r\nfishmonger, and as a merchant of London, and as having been purser of\r\na king’s ship. He so successfully trimmed his opinions to the varying\r\npolitical currents, as to retain his office during the reigns of Richard\r\nIII and Henry VII, until his death in 1488.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Royal Ships.]\r\n\r\nThe re-appointment of a keeper of the ships was the natural corollary of\r\nthe new formation of a crown navy which was going on slowly throughout\r\nthe reign. As early as July 1461 the _Margaret_ of Orwell, or of Ipswich,\r\nis spoken of as ‘our great ship,’ and was doubtless a merchantman bought\r\nby the crown. Without collateral evidence, however, the expression\r\n‘our ship’ does not always prove crown ownership; the phrase seems to\r\nhave been often used in writing of ships pressed for special service.\r\nThe _Margaret’s_ equipment included 200 bows at eighteenpence apiece,\r\n600 sheaves of arrows at eighteenpence the sheaf, bow strings at five\r\nshillings a gross, 200 spears at sixteenpence each and 1000 darts £5. As\r\nit also comprised 600 ‘gunstones’[88] at ten shillings the hundred and\r\n1000 lbs. of powder at fivepence a lb., she must have carried cannon as\r\nwell as the more primitive weapons.[89] In 1463, a caravel of Salcombe\r\nwas bought for £80, and the shares of the _John Evangelist_ of Dartmouth\r\npurchased from the joint owners in that and the following year.[90] In\r\n1468 the _Mary of Grace_ was bought from Sir Henry Waver[91] and in July\r\n1470 250 marks were given for a Portuguese ship, the _Garse_, obtained\r\nfrom John de Poinct of Portingale.[92] An order on the Exchequer did not\r\nhowever necessarily mean prompt payment unless money was plentiful, and\r\njust a year later another warrant was made out for John de Poinct as he\r\nwas still unpaid; not long after there is mention made of the _St Peter_,\r\na Spanish ship bought for £50 which sum had also long been owing.\r\n\r\nIn 1473 the _Grace Dieu_ once more occurs among the names of men-of-war.\r\nMarcus Symonson of Causere was paid £62, 8s 2d for pitch, tar, masts,\r\nand other necessaries supplied by him for the ‘new making of our\r\nshippe called the _Grace Dieu_.’[93] Unless she was one of the vessels\r\npreviously bought rebuilt and renamed, she must have been a new ship\r\nbut there are no other particulars concerning her. In 1472 there is a\r\ngrant of an annuity of £20 a year to this Mark Symonson, owner of the\r\n_Antony_ of Causere,[94] for the good services he had done and would\r\ndo; this large reward, equal to at least £200 a year now, points to the\r\npossibility of his having been captain and owner of the vessel which\r\nbrought Edward over to Ravenspurn in 1471. Another Spanish ship, the\r\n_Carycon_ was purchased in 1478 for £100 and in the same year William\r\nCombresale, who afterwards succeeded Rogers as clerk of the ships, is\r\nreferred to as master of the king’s ship _Trinity_, another new name.\r\nCarycon or Carraquon was simply old French for a large carrack, and the\r\nship, shortly afterwards, became the _Mary of the Tower_.[95] With the\r\n_Carycon_ and the _Trinity_ there is found, ‘the king’s ship called the\r\n_Fawcon_,’ and in 1483 Rogers was ordered ‘to repaire and make of the\r\nnewe our shippe the _Mary Ashe_,’ possibly the older _Mary of Grace_. The\r\nlast purchase is at the close of the reign in January 1483, when 100\r\nmarks was paid to Roger Kelsale, collector of customs at Southampton for\r\nhis share in a bark of Southampton lately bought.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Edward IV:—Naval and Commercial Policy.]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious from this list that Edward had set himself to reverse the\r\npractice of the preceding forty years, and had determined to restore the\r\nNavy. He must have taken a certain pride in it and in the appearance of\r\nthe men, since, for the first time, we find a payment on one occasion for\r\n‘jackettes’ for the sailors.[96] His interest in the men did not extend,\r\nhowever, to arresting the tendency to lower wages which were now one\r\nshilling and threepence a week, while the victualling was reckoned at one\r\nshilling and a halfpenny.[97] He had been granted in 1465, tunnage and\r\npoundage for life and therefore always had at command money to be devoted\r\nto naval purposes. Nor was he indifferent to the commercial interests\r\nof the kingdom. In 1464 a navigation act, the first consented to by the\r\nCrown since the reign of Richard II came into force, and although it\r\nwas allowed to lapse at the end of three years was an earnest of future\r\nand more effective legislation. He is said to have himself engaged in\r\ntrade, and the commercial treaties with Burgundy, Brittany and Castile,\r\nshow that he understood the sources of national wealth. Some of Edward’s\r\nbusiness transactions were with the Italian cities, and that the field\r\nof trade was generally enlarging is shown by the appointment in 1484 of\r\na consul at Florence, because ‘certain merchants and others from England\r\nintend to frequent foreign parts, and chiefly Italy with their ships and\r\nmerchandise.’ The old custom of hiring out men-of-war for trading voyages\r\nwas soon revived and, shortly before Bosworth field, the _Grace Dieu_ was\r\nlent to two London merchants for a Mediterranean journey but was finally\r\nkept back for the protection of the coasts.\r\n\r\nThe short and troubled reign of Richard III did not allow that monarch\r\nmuch time for naval development, but the crown service was not allowed\r\nto retrogress and some fresh ships were purchased. In January 1485 the\r\n_Nicholas_ of London was bought from Thos. Grafton, a London merchant,\r\nfor 100 marks, and the _Governor_ from Thos. Grafton and two others\r\nfor £600.[98] There seems to have been no attempt during the reigns of\r\nRichard and his brother, to form any centre for naval equipment and for\r\nstores, such as had existed at Southampton and Bursledon under Henry\r\nV, and at other places in the preceding centuries. Ships were fitted\r\nat Erith, or in the Orwell, or wherever they happened to be lying when\r\nrequired for service.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry VII:—The Royal Ships.]\r\n\r\nIn popular belief Henry VII shares with his son and grand-daughter,\r\nthe credit of founding the modern navy. This view is so far unfounded,\r\nthat, although its strength did not recede during his reign, and he\r\nprepared the way for further progress, he did not increase the force and\r\nreorganise the administration as did Henry VIII, nor use it with effect\r\nas did Elizabeth. Henry VII still relied on hired merchantmen to form the\r\nbulk of his fleets, an assistance his son almost succeeded in renouncing\r\nfor squadrons of the same strength. In 1590 out of eighteen vessels at\r\nsea only two were men-of-war. There are no accounts extant for the whole\r\nreign of the expenditure on the navy, but the amount for the first three\r\nyears was £1077,[99] and for 1495-8 £2060[100] exclusive of the cost of\r\nthe two large ships, the _Regent_ and _Sovereign_, built by his orders.\r\nAt any rate these sums represent a much more acute appreciation of the\r\nnecessity for sea power than that shown by his immediate predecessors.\r\n\r\nThe following is an attempt, perhaps imperfect, at the navy list of this\r\nreign:\r\n\r\n  _Grace Dieu_\r\n  _Mary of the Tower_\r\n  _Governor_\r\n  _Martin Garsya_\r\n  _Sovereign_\r\n  _Regent_\r\n  _Le Prise_ or _Margaret_ of Dieppe\r\n  _Bonaventure_\r\n  _Fawcon_\r\n  _Trinity_\r\n  _Sweepstake_\r\n  _Mary Fortune_\r\n  _Carvel of Ewe_\r\n\r\nOf these the _Grace Dieu_, _Mary of the Tower_, _Governor_, _Martin\r\nGarsya_, _Fawcon_, and _Trinity_ were obtained with the crown, the\r\n_Margaret_ was captured in 1490. Only the _Regent_, _Sovereign_, _Carvel\r\nof Ewe_, _Sweepstake_ and _Mary Fortune_ were new, the two latter being\r\nsmall vessels built at a charge of £231.[101] The _Carvel of Ewe_,[102]\r\nafter having been in the royal service by hire, was bought at some\r\nperiod of the reign. The name of the _Bonaventure_ only occurs once as\r\n‘our ship called the _Bonaventure_ ... William Nashe, yeoman of our\r\ncrown hath in his rule and governance,’[103] a reference which appears\r\nto point unmistakeably to a royal ship; she may have been the bark of\r\nSouthampton bought by Edward IV, or one of Richard’s purchases. The\r\n_Martin Garsya_ was given to Sir Richard Guldeford in December 1485,\r\nthe _Governor_ disappears after 1488, and the _Mary of the Tower_ after\r\n1496; the _Fawcon_, _Trinity_, and _Margaret_, after 1503. In 1486 Henry\r\ncommissioned a trusted officer, Sir Richard Guldeford, Master of the\r\nOrdnance, to superintend the construction of a large ship, afterwards\r\ncalled the _Regent_, at Reding on the river Rother, in Kent.[104] An\r\nExchequer warrant of 15th April 1487 directs the Treasurer to pay the\r\nmoney necessary ‘for the building of a ship of which he[105] has the\r\noversight in the county of Kent of 600 tons, like unto a ship called\r\nthe _Columbe_ of France.’ Nothing is now known of the _Columbe_, which\r\nHenry had perhaps seen when at Rouen, and which had evidently impressed\r\nhim. Payments on account of the _Regent_ to the amount of £951, 7s 10d\r\ncan still be traced, but this sum doubtless does not represent the\r\nwhole cost. While the _Regent_ was on the stocks the _Grace Dieu_ was\r\ndelivered to Sir Reginald Bray to be broken up and the material employed\r\nin building a new vessel, the _Sovereign_.[106] In neither instance had\r\nRogers, the official head of the administration, anything to do with the\r\nconstruction of these ships. Both Guldeford and Bray were men of rank\r\nand credit near the king’s person, and the work may have been assigned\r\nto them as a mark of confidence and as a cheap way of conferring some\r\npecuniary advantages on them.\r\n\r\nThe chronicler Stow says, under the year 1503, ‘the same King Henry made\r\na ship named the _Great Harry_, which ship with the furniture cost him\r\nmuch.’ Naval historians have successively accepted this statement, but\r\nall that can be said is that there is no trace of such a ship in the\r\nState Papers. Stow’s naval details are frequently more than doubtful.\r\nUnder 1512 he writes of ‘the _Regent_ or _Sovereign_’ of England; the\r\n_Regent_ was never called the _Sovereign_ which has an individual\r\nexistence down to 1525, but he may have meant the sovereign, or greatest\r\nship.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry VII:—The Clerk of the Ships.]\r\n\r\nWhen Rogers died in 1488, he was a man of substance and a landed\r\nproprietor in Hertfordshire. He was succeeded by William Comersall or\r\nCumbresale, of whom we know nothing except that he had held executive\r\nrank at sea during the reign of Edward IV, as master of the _Trinity_.\r\nHe appears to have been content with a position of minor importance,\r\nand during his term of office payments in connection with the _Regent_\r\nand the _Sovereign_ were frequently made through other persons. From\r\n19th May 1495, Robert Brygandine was appointed, and while held by this\r\nman, practically, although not nominally the last of the mediæval clerks\r\nor keepers, the post regained some of its former dignity. Brygandine\r\nwas a ‘yeoman of the crown,’ that is to say in the personal service\r\nof the sovereign, and, on one occasion, mentions that he had received\r\ncertain orders from the king _vivâ voce_. In 1490 he had been granted an\r\nannuity of £10 a year, besides other favours, and altogether seems to\r\nhave belonged to a higher class socially than his predecessors, and was\r\ntherefore better able to maintain the independence of his office.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: General Policy—The Bounty.]\r\n\r\nAlthough Henry VII, during a reign of twenty-four years, added only five\r\nor six vessels to the navy, it cannot be said that he was indifferent\r\nto the maritime strength of the country, or to that of the navy proper.\r\nThe political conditions did not require fleets at sea as they had done\r\nin the fourteenth, and again did in the succeeding century. The objects\r\nsought by Louis XI, Charles VIII, and Louis XII did not necessitate\r\nstrength at sea, at anyrate in the Channel, and when Henry VII did act\r\nabroad English ships were only engaged in the unopposed transport of\r\ntroops. The existence, however, of a Royal Navy did not prevent Perkin\r\nWarbeck’s attempted landing in Kent, nor impede his sailing about the\r\nnarrow seas, subsequently, unmolested and apparently at his own pleasure.\r\nNevertheless Henry recognised that, as fleets were then constituted,\r\nthe naval strength of the crown was, in the end, dependent on that of\r\nthe country generally, and acted upon that view in a way that was new\r\nin English history. He commenced giving the bounty on the construction\r\nof large ships which remained customary for a century and a half, and\r\nwhich did much to encourage the production of vessels fit for war\r\nservice. Perhaps some similar reward may have been given by earlier kings\r\nalthough the instance of Taverner’s _Grace Dieu_, previously noticed, is\r\nthe only one which supports that view. If such rewards had been given\r\nthey could have been only occasional but Henry made the encouragement\r\nmuch more frequent and a part of his policy. On the other hand the plan\r\nmay have been copied from the usage of a foreign power, and if so that\r\npower was Spain. We know the reverential admiration Henry felt for the\r\nSpanish monarchs and their methods; in 1494, 1495, and 1498 Ferdinand\r\nand Isabella issued ordinances which promised large rewards of 60,000\r\nto 100,000 maravedis, to the builders of ships of from 600 to 1000\r\ntons.[107] These were probably not the first of such regulations, and\r\nthe service they did may well have been forced on Henry’s notice when an\r\nexile. Certainly the Spanish marine at this time was in a flourishing\r\ncondition. The fleet of 1496, which carried Dona Juana to Middleburgh\r\nconsisted of 120 seagoing vessels, and in the same year a royal order\r\ndirected the preparation of two ships each of 1000 tons, two of 500, two\r\nof 400, six of 300, four of 200, and four caravels.[108]\r\n\r\nThe first warrant for the payment of a bounty is dated in 1488,[109] and\r\norders £26, 13s 4d to be allowed to Nicholas Browne of Bristol on the\r\ncustoms of the first voyage, made by a new ship of 140 tons built by\r\nhim. This is nearly three shillings and tenpence a ton. The next of 16th\r\nMay 1491,[110] is again in favour of three Bristol men who have built\r\na 400 ton ship, and, ‘we calling to our remembrance the great cost and\r\ncharge they have sustained about the same ... to encourage them and such\r\nothers,’ allow five shillings a ton on the customs. Although 400 tons was\r\nnot an unknown tonnage in the merchant marine, it was as yet exceptional,\r\nand when the bounty, a century later, was most vigorously worked, its\r\ntendency was to induce the construction of medium ships, somewhat over or\r\nunder 200 tons, rather than especially large ones. Sir William Fenkyll,\r\nan alderman of London, had 100 marks conceded him in the same way as the\r\nothers, ‘for the encoragyng of othr our true subgetts the rather to apply\r\nthemself to the makyng of shippes.’[111] By a warrant of 7th January\r\n1502, Robert and William Thorne and Hugh Elyot of Bristol, having bought\r\na French ship of 120 tons and as ‘with the same ship the said merchants\r\noffre to doo unto us service at all tymes at our commaundement,’ had\r\n£20 allowed them. The sovereign by whose directions these expressions\r\nwere used was neither ignorant of the importance, nor indifferent to the\r\ngrowth, of the merchant marine although he may have seen no reason for\r\ndeparting from his native prudence in matters of action.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry VII:—Hire of English and Foreign Ships.]\r\n\r\nHenry’s caution seems to have calculated on the possibility of his\r\nfuture dependence on a foreign fleet, and he was anxious to make a good\r\nimpression among shipowners abroad. There is a curiously worded order in\r\n1486[112] for the payment of three hired Spanish vessels ‘withoute any\r\npart deteyning or abbrigging as that they may have cause to make goode\r\nreporte of our deling with them in these parties and as they may be\r\nencouraged and welewilled to serve us semblably hereafter.’ As a matter\r\nof fact the king frequently hired Spaniards while the royal ships were\r\nunemployed, and when the services demanded certainly threw no strain\r\non native resources; he may have seen in such a course a minor way of\r\nknitting more closely the mercantile and other ties which were connecting\r\nSpain and England. These Spanish ships were hired at two shillings a\r\nton per month, a rate which was double that obtained by English owners.\r\nSometimes Henry tried to buy a Spanish vessel, but with little success,\r\nfor Ferdinand and Isabella were making stringent regulations against the\r\nsale abroad of vessels owned by their subjects.\r\n\r\nOne reason explaining Henry’s propensity for foreign ships may perhaps\r\nbe found in a hint we have of difficulties about the rate of hire of\r\nEnglish ones. In 1487 special sums were granted to some English owners,\r\n‘to the entent that noe president shall be taken by us for the waging of\r\nthe same aftre the portage of every tonne.’[113] According to this they\r\ndesired to be paid a fixed sum and not hired by the ton, perhaps because\r\nthe crown estimate of a ship’s tonnage may have differed considerably\r\nfrom the owner’s. If this were so it is the only suggestion we have of\r\ndissatisfaction with the normal way of payment, and it was a contention\r\nin which the crown soon and finally gained the victory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry VII:—Portsmouth Dock.]\r\n\r\nIf Henry VII built few ships he laid the foundation of a permanent\r\nestablishment for building and repairs in a way hitherto unknown. We\r\nhave seen that Henry V had storehouses at London and Southampton, and a\r\nworkshop in the last named town, and that a dock in the fifteenth century\r\nmeant only a temporary arrangement by which a ship was laid ashore at\r\na suitable place. Such primitive appliances were the completest yet\r\nattained. Henry proceeded much further, and in June 1495, Brygandine was\r\nordered to superintend the construction of a dry dock at Portsmouth, the\r\nfirst known to have been built in England. If one existed previously no\r\nreference to it has survived, and we may suppose that the new departure\r\nwas the result of foreign superiority in such matters rather than of\r\nnative enterprise. No foreigner however was employed in the work, and\r\nBrygandine, so far as we know, had had no training as an engineer. The\r\nundertaking was completed without accident and without any delay caused\r\nby unforeseen difficulties. The total cost was £193, 0s 6¾d; it was\r\nbuilt of wood except the dockhead, which was ‘fortifyed’ with stone and\r\ngravel, of which 664 tons were used, and although it is not so stated,\r\nit may be assumed that the timber walls were backed with stone. During\r\n1495-7 forty-six weeks were spent in the work, operations being suspended\r\nbetween November 1495 and February 1496, and between April of the latter\r\nyear and July 1497. When the _Sovereign_ came out of this dock twenty\r\nmen were at work for twenty-nine days ‘at every tide both day and night\r\nweying up of the piles and shorys and digging of ye clay and other\r\nrubbish between the gates.’ From this it may be conjectured that the\r\ngates did not meet in closing, but that the structure was of this form\r\n[Illustration] an arrangement doubtless due to fear of the pressure of\r\nthe water outside when the one ‘ingyn’ employed for the purpose had\r\nsucceeded in emptying the dock. The expression ‘as well for ye inner as\r\nye uttermost gate,’ also bears out this view. The dock itself occupied\r\ntwenty-four weeks, the gates and dockhead twenty-two weeks, the number\r\nof men paid each week varying between twenty-eight and sixty. Carpenters\r\nreceived from fourpence to sixpence a day, sawyers fourpence and\r\nlabourers threepence. Four tons of iron at £3 14s and £4 a ton were used,\r\nbesides large quantities of nails, spikes and other iron work.[114]\r\n\r\nFrom 1485 a storehouse was hired at Greenwich for the use of the ships\r\nlying in the river, at a yearly rental of £5, but down to 1550-60\r\nPortsmouth, in virtue of its dock and the subsidiary establishments\r\nwhich grew up round it, remained the predominant naval port. Few of the\r\ntownspeople, however, seem to have been able to supply any necessaries,\r\nstores having to be sent from London or bought at Southampton; wood was\r\nthe only thing obtained plentifully in the neighbourhood. When Deptford,\r\nWoolwich, and Chatham were founded its one advantage of lying in the\r\nChannel did not serve it against the greater facilities they offered in\r\nother respects.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry VII:—Character of Shipping.]\r\n\r\nThe ships of Henry VII are found to resemble in equipment and fittings\r\nthose of his successors rather than the mediæval type, but that may be\r\nbecause we have no inventories of the time of Edward IV and the later\r\nyears of Henry VI. Improvement must have been continuous although there\r\nis no trace of the successive steps. The _Regent_ and the _Sovereign_\r\nwere respectively four- and three-masters, with fore and main topmasts;\r\nalthough the topmasts were separate spars it is probable that they were\r\nfixed and that a method of striking them had not yet been introduced.\r\nThese two ships must have differed much less in appearance from a sailing\r\nship of 1785 than from one of 1385 or even of 1425. They were fitted\r\nwith a forecastle, poop, and poop royal, with a bowsprit and spritsail,\r\nand the fixed and running gear were, generally, much the same as now.\r\nAs a detailed inventory of the _Henry Grace à Dieu_ of not many years\r\nlater, and varying but little in type, is given in this volume it is not\r\nnecessary to describe them in detail.[115]\r\n\r\nThe introduction of portholes is usually attributed to Decharges, a\r\nFrench inventor of Brest and the date given is 1501. They were certainly\r\nknown long before[116] but their adaptation to the purpose of broadside\r\nfire was doubtless one of the improvements of the sixteenth century.\r\nStill the date of their general acceptation must be before 1501 and\r\nearlier than is generally supposed, since the _Regent_ and _Sovereign_\r\nhave their poops and forecastles pierced for broadsides, and there is no\r\nsuggestion that there was anything novel in such a plan. It need hardly\r\nbe pointed out that the presence of a large number of guns along the\r\nsides brought about a complete alteration in shipbuilding. Not only had\r\nvessels to be more strongly built to meet the greater weight and strain,\r\nbut the ‘tumble home’ tendency of the topsides was increased to bring the\r\nordnance nearer the keel line.\r\n\r\nThe _Mary Fortune_ and the _Sweepstake_ were much smaller vessels but\r\nwere also three-masters, with a main topmast and sixty and eighty\r\noars respectively for use on board. Vessels of this type, which were\r\nfrequently called galleys by those who used them, have been erroneously\r\nsupposed by later writers to denote the real galley, to which they bore\r\nnot the least resemblance, or to represent a modified type peculiar to\r\nthe English service. They were ordinary ships differing in no respect\r\nbut size from their larger sisters, but small enough to permit the use\r\nof sweeps when necessary. The serpentine weighing, without any carriage,\r\nabout 250 lbs. was the usual ship gun, and the _Regent_ carried 151 of\r\nthese in iron and 29 in brass in 1501.[117] Of course bows and arrows\r\nand all the older armament were still carried. The ships’ sides were\r\nlined with pavesses or wooden shields painted in various colours and\r\nglittering with coats of arms and devices. For painting the _Regent_\r\nand _Mary Fortune_, and doubtless other ships, vermillion, fine gold,\r\nrusset, bice,[118] red lead, white lead, brown, Spanish white, verdigris,\r\nand aneral[119] were employed.[120] The favourite Tudor colours, white\r\nand green, with the cross of St George, flew out in the standards and\r\nstreamers which were of ‘linen cloth’ or of say.[121]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry VII:—Officers and Men.]\r\n\r\nThe pay of the men was one shilling a week as shipkeeper in harbour,\r\nand one shilling and threepence when on active service. Victualling at\r\nfirst cost one shilling and a halfpenny a week, but subsequently rose\r\nto one shilling and twopence, and shipwrights, sawyers, labourers, and\r\nall others employed about the ships received food as well as pay. The\r\njackets noticed under Edward IV, which perhaps signified some sort of\r\nuniform, were still provided. One hundred, at one shilling and fourpence\r\napiece, were bought for the same number of men sent from Cornwall to\r\nBerwick to join the fleet acting in conjunction with Surrey’s army\r\nagainst Scotland in 1497.[122] The sea captain was still non-existent,\r\nthat rank being confined to the leadership of the soldiers on board; the\r\nmaster, the highest executive naval officer, received three shillings and\r\nfourpence a week, the purser and boatswain one shilling and eightpence,\r\nquartermasters one shilling and sixpence, the steward and cook one\r\nshilling and threepence.[123] These were harbour rates; at sea the pay\r\nappears to have been much higher. When the _Sovereign_ was brought from\r\nthe Thames to Portsmouth, a voyage which occupied thirty-one days, the\r\nmaster obtained £2 10s, the purser 14s 8d, the quartermasters 10s each,\r\nthe boatswain 16s 8d, the steward 8s, and the cook 10s.[124]\r\n\r\nOf the condition, habits, and manner of thought among the men we know\r\nnothing. Ferdinand’s ambassador, De Puebla wrote to him that, ‘the\r\nEnglish sailors are generally savages,’ but he was not the last envoy\r\nwhose delicate diplomatic sense they have outraged by plain speaking.\r\nThis sensitive gentleman lodged, however, in a house of ill-fame in\r\nLondon from motives of economy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Henry VII:—Commercial Policy.]\r\n\r\nIn commercial matters Henry followed those methods dictated by the\r\npolitical economy of his age, which seemed likely to increase the trade\r\nand shipping of the country. A navigation act of the first year of his\r\nreign, and this time meant seriously, forbade the importation of foreign\r\nwines in any but English, Irish, or Welsh owned ships. Three years later\r\nit was enacted[125]\r\n\r\n    ‘That where great minishing and decay hath been of late time of\r\n    the navy of this realme of England and idleness of the mariners\r\n    within the same, by the which this noble realm within short\r\n    space of time, without reformation be had therein shall not be\r\n    of ability, nor of strength and power to defend itself.’\r\n\r\nNo wines or Toulouse woad were to be imported except in ships owned by\r\nEnglish subjects and, ‘most part’ manned by native crews. The punishment\r\nfor disobedience was the forfeiture of one half the cargo to the king,\r\nand one half to the informer; under the same penalty exportation of goods\r\nin foreign vessels was forbidden if English ships could be obtained.\r\nYet notwithstanding the desponding tone of this preamble, trade was\r\nnow travelling far afield. The consul at Florence of 1484 had now an\r\nassociate at Pisa, and a treaty of commerce in 1490 with Denmark shows\r\nthat we possessed establishments there and in Norway and Sweden, and that\r\nthe trade was carried on in English bottoms. The king frequently let out\r\nhis men-of-war on hire for distant voyages, and if merchants found it\r\nprofitable to take a ship of the size of the _Sovereign_ for a voyage\r\nto the Levant the Mediterranean trade must have been already of some\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nEdward IV, by a commercial treaty of 1467 with Burgundy, granted free\r\nfishing round the English coasts to the subjects of that power. This\r\nwas confirmed by the treaties of 1496 and 1499 but withdrawn by that\r\nof 1506, called therefore by the Flemish the _Intercursus Malus_. It\r\nis possible that Henry recognised the value of the fishing industry as\r\na nursery of seamen, but more probable that he was impelled by purely\r\npolitical motives.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The New Discoveries.]\r\n\r\nThe discovery of America and the passage round the Cape of Good Hope\r\nmust have impressed the king intellectually even though his imagination\r\nwas untouched by the wonders daily opened to the old world, but there is\r\nlittle evidence that he wished England to join directly in the search\r\nfor new sources of wealth. The half-hearted assistance given to the\r\nCabots, and the licences without assistance granted to Elliot, Ashurst,\r\nand others of Bristol, were not aids of a nature to win success in new\r\nand doubtful undertakings. This course of action is usually ascribed to\r\nHenry’s parsimony, but it may well be that he feared to be brought into\r\npolitical antagonism with Spain and Portugal, and that he was dubious\r\nof the ability of his subjects to keep up profitable communication\r\nbetween countries separated by vast distances of sea. England possessed\r\ncomparatively little floating capital, and capital is as essential to\r\ncolonisation as to smaller businesses. We know that intercourse with the\r\nWest completely changed the character of the Spanish marine in causing\r\nit to be replaced by ships of a larger and more commodious type, a\r\nchange which alone postulates the waste and subsequent investment of a\r\nrelatively enormous sum. But Spain, even before the voyage of Columbus,\r\nwas a much wealthier country than England, and it seems that if any\r\nprofitable discoveries had been due at this time to English explorers\r\nthey would soon have been found to have been made for the benefit of\r\nstronger and wealthier powers. Moreover the political risk was not an\r\nimaginary one and might have induced the condition of things existing\r\nunder Elizabeth when the country was much less able to hold its own.\r\nThere is an illustration of this in the orders given by the Spanish\r\nmonarchs in 1501 to Alonso de Hojeda to impede the progress of English\r\ndiscoveries on the transatlantic coast.[126]\r\n\r\nThat Henry had not forgotten the traditions of the past and realised the\r\nvalue of a national marine is shown by his maintenance of the navy, by\r\nthe formation of a royal dockyard, by his navigation acts, and, above\r\nall, by the inauguration of the bounty system on ocean-going ships. In\r\nthis, as in other things, he moved slowly, but the progress in the end\r\nwas none the less complete because in the beginning it had not been\r\nunduly stimulated by encouragements not warranted by either the needs\r\nor capabilities of the country. The crown, instead of being controlled\r\nby nobles indifferent to, or despising commerce, was now influenced by\r\nthe commercial classes and found its profit in aiding their development.\r\nThese classes were now replacing the capital destroyed in the wars of\r\nthe fifteenth century, eager for fresh markets, and with no maritime\r\nadversary to fear. For the moment English mercantile effort took a\r\ndirection that did not bring it into conflict with larger interests, but\r\nwhen the natural expansion of trade and shipping brought the country\r\ninto collision with other powers the struggles of centuries, which had\r\nshaped and hardened a skilful and dauntless maritime population, bore\r\ntheir natural fruit in a school of seamen able to use and direct the\r\ninstruments which the increasing wealth and ambition of the nation placed\r\nin their hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY VIII\r\n\r\n1509-1547\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The New Policy and its Causes.]\r\n\r\nHenry VII had been chiefly occupied in securing the permanence of his\r\ndynasty, and although sometimes drawn into action abroad, had avoided any\r\nserious entanglement in continental politics. His son’s policy was the\r\nreverse of this, and his reign presents a series of unsuccessful attempts\r\nto make England the centre round which European politics were to revolve.\r\nThese views necessitated the maintenance and employment of an armed\r\nforce, and although the army was still considered the effective weapon of\r\noffence the growing opinion that the navy was essentially the national\r\narm ensured a proper solicitude being bestowed upon it, although its real\r\npredominance was not yet recognised; ‘when we would enlarge ourselves let\r\nit be that way we can and to which it seems the eternal Providence hath\r\ndestined us,’ was, we are told, the argument of those who were opposed\r\nto an invasion of France by land.[127] The use of such reasoning as this\r\nshows that the epoch of maritime expansion was not far distant.\r\n\r\nBut besides deduction from past experience there were other causes\r\nworking to induce a natural and, it may be said, almost automatic\r\nincrease in the navy of the crown. In the past centuries ‘our ancient\r\nadversary’ of France had been the only enemy really within touch, and no\r\nsystematic attack by sea from France had been practicable for more than a\r\nhundred years. But the consolidation of that kingdom, and the accession\r\nof Francis I, a monarch by no means indifferent to the supremacy of\r\nthe sea, one of whose first acts was to order the construction and\r\nfortification of the Port of Havre in 1516-17, and who built ships and\r\nbrought round fleets from the Mediterranean to contest the command of\r\nthe channel, necessarily compelled a corresponding activity on the\r\nEnglish side. Another circumstance enforcing increased naval strength\r\nwas the union of Brittany with the French crown. This event was regarded\r\nby contemporary Englishmen somewhat in the light that we should now\r\nlook upon the domination of the coastlines of Holland and Belgium by\r\nGermany and France. The marriage of Anne of Brittany to Charles VIII,\r\nin December 1491, gave France its most valuable arsenals and ports, and\r\nthe command of a race of fine seamen. Henry VII, perhaps recognising\r\nthat the subjection of the province could only at most be deferred and\r\nnot prevented, made but perfunctory efforts, either by war or diplomacy,\r\nto hinder it. Hitherto, except for the customary practice of piracy,\r\nthe Breton ports had been neutral or friendly, and the Breton seamen\r\nindifferent to the dynastic or national quarrels of the two great powers.\r\nIn the future the ports were to be the chief source of danger to English\r\nmaritime supremacy, and the men the mainstay of the navy which carried on\r\na prolonged and doubtful contest with England for more than a century.\r\n\r\nWith Spain, notwithstanding isolated ship and fleet actions occasionally\r\noccurring, warfare had never been serious or continuous, nor had the\r\npolitical interests of the two countries been of such a nature as\r\nto bring them into conflict. The union, however, under the sway of\r\nCharles V, of the Empire, of Spain, and of the Netherlands, altered,\r\nin view of the new attitude assumed by Henry VIII, the pre-existing\r\nsituation, and here again, besides the Imperial troops, Spanish fleets\r\nhad to be reckoned with. Although those fleets were never in reality so\r\npowerful as they appeared to contemporary observers, the necessities of\r\nTrans-Atlantic voyages and the practice of ocean navigation had given\r\nexperience to officers and men and improved the build of the ships,\r\nso far at anyrate as size and apparent power were concerned.[128]\r\nAccommodation had to be supplied for larger crews and for numerous\r\npassengers, but the science of shipbuilding was not sufficiently advanced\r\nto meet these requirements except by methods which gave bigness at the\r\nexpense of seaworthiness. But whatever the actual combatant value of the\r\nSpanish navy, or its power of mobilisation at any required moment and\r\nplace, it was a factor to be considered in the counsels of the Emperor’s\r\npossible enemies and was another reason for the strengthening of the\r\nEnglish navy. That that navy occupied a strategically advantageous\r\nposition on the line of communication between the peninsular and northern\r\npossessions of the Empire was a fact not likely to be forgotten by the\r\nadvisers of either Henry or Charles.\r\n\r\nIn the north a comparatively long peace with Scotland, and the\r\ndistractions caused by the Wars of the Roses, had enabled that power to\r\nextend its commerce and obtain a prosperity reflected in the existence\r\nof a navy, for the first and only time strong enough to attract the\r\nattention of foreign observers. In 1512 James IV had three agents in\r\nFrance especially retained to arrange a supply of naval stores and\r\nships,[129] and Lord Darcy informed Henry that the king of Scotland, who\r\nspent much of his time on board the ships, possessed some sixteen or\r\ntwenty men-of-war. The _Great Michael_ recently built, and perhaps the\r\nactual instigation of the _Henry Grace à Dieu_, was one of the wonders\r\nof the country and reputed to be the largest and strongest vessel yet\r\nlaunched in northern latitudes. That ‘Jack Tarrett, a Frenchman,’ was her\r\nshipwright pointed to the ever present danger of the old alliance between\r\nFrance and Scotland, a danger much intensified if Scotland was to take a\r\nplace as a naval power.\r\n\r\nWithout, therefore, attributing to Henry VIII an exceptional\r\nforesight, the conditions were such as to compel an increase in the\r\nnavy commensurate with the larger aims of the royal policy and the\r\nwider duties the execution of such a policy involved. The navy was not\r\nrelatively larger than it had been under some of the preceding kings,\r\nnotably Henry V, the main distinction being that under Henry VIII it was\r\nslowly tending towards its future position as a principal instrument\r\nof offence instead of acting as a mere auxiliary. This, again, was as\r\nmuch, or more, due to the changed circumstances of land warfare as to\r\nany definite intention. The English army was still a militia; the troops\r\nof France and the Empire were now standing armies, highly trained and\r\nveterans in war. For most of the western countries the age of feudal\r\nlevies was over, but England had not yet clearly acknowledged the new\r\nera. The troops sent under the Marquis of Dorset in 1512 to invade\r\nGuienne, in conjunction with Ferdinand’s Spaniards, returned home _en\r\nmasse_ in defiance of their commander’s and of Henry’s orders and\r\nthreats. ‘The world was breathless with astonishment at such a flagrant\r\nact of insubordination.’[130] An English army was not yet composed\r\nof ragged losels pressed from the gutter, but the ancient feudal tie\r\nwhich knit together knight and retainer was almost destroyed. Armies of\r\nthis type could not possibly match themselves against the professional\r\ncontinental soldiers. But the country could not have afforded nor would\r\nit have permitted a permanent military force, therefore either its claims\r\nto exercise a powerful mediatory position were to be forsaken or that\r\npeculiar genius for the sea, which had hitherto been of secondary use\r\nbut which had always been implicitly recognised as the especial heritage\r\nof the race, was to replace the mere ability to fight it shared with\r\nmany other nations. But for the singular skill of the English archer\r\nthe change would have come long before; improvements in artillery and\r\nmusketry at last compelled it. The effects were not plainly seen till the\r\nreign of Elizabeth, but the militant history of Henry VIII is a series\r\nof steps—whether due to a sagacious recognition of the altered situation\r\nor to a mechanical compliance with it—towards an increase in the power\r\nand use of the Navy, and improvements in its administration, although, as\r\nthe traditions of centuries are not lightly set aside, armies were still\r\nlevied to fulfil their ancient _rôle_ in France.\r\n\r\nThere was also another and personal element which doubtless had its\r\ninfluence. Henry was, if not a born sailor, at least something more than\r\na yachtsman. He was continually inquiring about the merits of new ships,\r\nand requiring reports on their sailing qualities in a way that implied\r\nsome technical knowledge, and showed a real interest beyond the political\r\none in sea affairs. He is said to have been himself the designer of a new\r\nmodel. Sometimes he acted as an amateur master or pilot and dressed the\r\ncharacter, of course in cloth of gold. On one occasion when present at\r\nthe launch of a vessel he wore vest and breeches of cloth of gold, and\r\nscarlet hose, with a gold chain and whistle.[131] This was a factor which\r\nhelped the progress of events, but which could have had little influence\r\nhad the royal inclination been contrary to the tendency of the time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Royal Navy List.]\r\n\r\nThe following list of the men-of-war of the reign, has for convenience\r\nbeen thrown into a tabular form, which, however, gives it a fuller and\r\nmore final appearance than it is intended to claim. The records are not\r\nsufficiently complete or detailed to enable the inquirer to be certain in\r\nall cases of the exact year of building, rebuilding or purchase, and a\r\nfurther element of uncertainty is introduced by the changes of name which\r\noccurred, and continuity of name in what may be supposed to be new ships,\r\nbut of whose building there is no distinct evidence. The dates printed in\r\nheavier type may be taken as exact; the others can only be regarded as\r\nlikely to be correct, and the tonnage varies at different times in nearly\r\nevery ship. From the preceding reign came the _Regent_, _Sovereign_,\r\n_Mary and John_, (or _Carvel of Ewe_), _Sweepstake_ and _Mary Fortune_.\r\n\r\n

enlarged the\r\nnavy, but the foregoing list shows a much more extensive increase than\r\nis implied by a general expression and, if so far as number is concerned\r\nit errs at all, it errs on the side of omission. A little indulgence in\r\nadmitting names could have extended it considerably. No foreign purchased\r\nmerchantman has been inserted without the authority of a definite\r\nstatement, or unless it appears in lists later than the reign under\r\nconsideration; but there are foreign ships omitted as only temporarily\r\nhired which may really have belonged to the crown. Other vessels which\r\noccur in almost indistinguishable fashion among men-of-war have been\r\nleft out in view of the custom which frequently obtained of describing\r\nhired ships as king’s ships while they were in the royal service, and\r\nin some cases it has been found impossible to satisfactorily trace\r\nparticular vessels. For instance, during the first half of the reign a\r\n‘great galley’ of 600 or 800 tons, flits in a most puzzling way through\r\nsome, but not the most reliable, of the papers. I take it to have been an\r\nindefinite designation applied at various times to various ships,[211]\r\nbut that opinion may be altogether wrong and it may be the actual name\r\nof a large vessel which has left no other indication of its existence.\r\nAgain, the Earl of Southampton, for four years Admiral of England,\r\nbequeathed Henry his ‘great ship’ by his will dated September 1542. The\r\nEarl died in 1543, but which is the ship in question, or whether it\r\nappears at all in the foregoing list, cannot be determined.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Activity in Construction and Purchase of Ships.]\r\n\r\nExclusive of the thirteen rowbarges, there are eighty-five vessels,\r\nand of these forty-six were built, twenty-six purchased, and thirteen\r\nwere prizes. The periods of greatest activity synchronise with war with\r\nFrance 1512-14, war with France and Scotland 1522-5, with the possibility\r\nin 1539 of a general alliance on religious grounds against England,\r\nand with war against France and Scotland in 1544-6. But allowing for\r\nuncertainty of dates, possibility of omissions, and our almost entire\r\nignorance of the repairs and rebuildings which must have been progressing\r\nuninterruptedly, there is no cessation of vigorous action throughout the\r\nreign. The existing dockyards could have hardly been equal to the demands\r\non them for repairs alone, and this is doubtless one reason for the large\r\nnumber of ships purchased, a course which was also probably cheaper for\r\nthe moment. All Henry’s foreign purchases seem to have been Italian or\r\nHanseatic. During 1511-14 he hired several Spaniards and tried to buy\r\nsome, but his desires were vain in face of the strict Spanish navigation\r\nlaws. In 1513 the Spanish envoy, de Quiros, was instructed to inform the\r\nking that the sale of Spanish ships abroad was forbidden under heavy\r\npenalties, and that his government could not permit them to be sold even\r\nto Henry.[212] In fact we find from another source that the sale of ships\r\nwas forbidden to foreigners even though they were naturalised Spanish\r\nsubjects, and as, from October 1502, a bounty of 100 maravedis a ton was\r\ngiven up to 1500 tons it is hardly surprising that their sale to aliens\r\nwas sternly interdicted.[213] In 1513 Knight wrote to Henry that the\r\nwhole of a Spaniard’s goods had been confiscated for selling a carrack to\r\nhim. Under these circumstances the king had to buy in the North German\r\nports, and, judging from the small number of years most of them remained\r\nin the effective, many must have been built for the purpose of sale to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Royal Ships:—Build and Rigging.]\r\n\r\nThe vessel which has the chief place in popular memory is the _Henry\r\nGrace à Dieu_, but she probably differed little in size, form, or\r\nequipment, from others nearly as large. Her total cost, with the three\r\nsmall barques built with her, was £8708 5s 3d, but out of the 3739 tons\r\nof timber used 1987 cost nothing being presented by several peers,\r\nprivate persons, and religious bodies. According to the accounts she\r\nwas constructed under the supervision of William Bond, but if a nearly\r\ncontemporary letter may be trusted Brygandine, the clerk of the ships\r\ndesigned and built her.[214] Bond’s connection with her may have been\r\nmerely financial and confined to payments of money. Fifty-six tons of\r\niron, 565 stones of oakum and 1711 lbs of flax were other items. She\r\nwas a four-master and possibly a two-decker with fore, main and mizen\r\ntop-gallant sails, but with only two sails on the other masts, and\r\nwith two tops on each of the three principal masts.[215] All ships but\r\nthe very smallest had four masts, the two after ones being called,\r\nrespectively, the main and bonaventure mizens. There was nothing\r\nexceptional in the _Henry’s_ fittings, top-gallant sails being known to\r\nhave been used in the previous reign, and, as at that time, the topmasts\r\nwere not arranged for lowering. An equivalent to the ease given a\r\nlabouring ship by striking the topmasts was obtained by lowering the fore\r\nand main yards to the level of the bulwarks. As most of the guns were\r\ncarried in the poop and forecastle ships must have been ‘built loftie’\r\non the Spanish model and presented a squat and ungainly appearance.\r\nVessels were now mostly carvel built, and those clench, or clinker,\r\nbuilt, were regarded as too weak to stand the shock of collision when\r\nboarding was intended. Speaking of some foreign ships brought into\r\nPortsmouth, Suffolk wrote that some of them were ‘clenchers, both feeble,\r\nolde, and out of fashion,’ and therefore not to be taken up for service\r\nwith the fleet.[216]\r\n\r\nSpritsails were now coming into more common use and, with the spanker on\r\nthe bonaventure mizen or fourth mast and sometimes with another on the\r\nmain mizen, served the purpose of the later fore-and-aft sails. Vessels\r\nwere now, although still slowly and clumsily, able to work more closely\r\nto windward. There is one entry which runs ‘eight small masts at 6s 8d\r\nthe pece ymploied in the _Great Bark_ and other the Kynges shipps for\r\nsteddying saills.’[217] It can only be said that there is no mention in\r\nthe inventories, or any sign in the drawings of ships of this century, of\r\nwhat are now called studding sails.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Royal Ships:—Armament.]\r\n\r\nAn ordinary vessel appears to have been armed along the waist, in her\r\nforecastle of two or three tiers, and in her summer castle or poop,\r\nalso divided into decks. For some of these ships we still have the\r\narmament:—[218]\r\n\r\n  +---------------------------+----------------------------------------+\r\n  |                           |Single Serpentines                      |\r\n  |                           |     |Double Serpentines[219]           |\r\n  |  _Great Elizabeth_[224]   |     |     |Slings[220]                 |\r\n  |                           |     |     |     |Half Slings           |\r\n  |                           |     |     |     |     |Stone Guns[221] |\r\n  |                           |     |     |     |     |     |Murderers |\r\n  |                           |     |     |     |     |     |  [222]   |\r\n  +---------------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----------+\r\n  |          { Upper Deck[223]|     |     |     |     |     |    2     |\r\n  |Fo’c’stle { Middle Deck    | 16  |     |     |     |     |          |\r\n  |          { Nether Deck    | 12  |     |     |     |  8  |          |\r\n  |            Waist          |     |     |     |     |     |          |\r\n  |            Stern          |     |     |     |  2  |  1  |          |\r\n  |          { Upper Deck     | 12  |     |     |  2  |     |          |\r\n  |     Poop { Middle Deck    | 41  |     |     |     |     |          |\r\n  |          { Nether Deck    |  3  |     |     |  2  | 16  |    6     |\r\n  +---------------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+----------+\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------+---------------------------------------------+\r\n  |                       |Falcons                                      |\r\n  |                       |     |Single Serpentines                     |\r\n  |                       |     |     |Double Serpentines               |\r\n  |   _Great Barbara_     |     |     |     |Slings                     |\r\n  |                       |     |     |     |     |Half Slings          |\r\n  |                       |     |     |     |     |     |Stone Guns     |\r\n  |                       |     |     |     |     |     |     |Murderers|\r\n  +-----------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+---------+\r\n  |          { Upper Deck |     |  7  |     |     |     |     |    2    |\r\n  |Fo’c’stle { Middle Deck|     |     |     |     |     |     |         |\r\n  |          { Nether Deck|     |  7  |     |     |     |     |    2    |\r\n  |            Waist      |     |  6  |     |     |     |  2  |         |\r\n  |            Stern      |     |     |     |     |     |     |         |\r\n  |          { Upper Deck |  6  |     |     |     |     |     |         |\r\n  |     Poop { Middle Deck|  2  |     |     |     |     |     |    2    |\r\n  |          { Nether Deck|     |     |     |     |     |     |    4    |\r\n  +-----------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+---------+\r\n\r\nShips like the _Henry_, _Sovereign_, and _Mary Rose_ carried also\r\nheavier pieces than these, the commencement of the change to fewer but\r\nmore powerful guns, which progressed rapidly during the middle of the\r\ncentury. The _Mary Rose_ had 79 guns (besides six in her tops), of which\r\n33 were serpentines, 26 stone guns, and 10 murderers, but she also\r\nhad five brass curtalls and five brass falcons.[225] The _Sovereign_,\r\nwhen rebuilt in 1509, was given four whole and three half curtalls of\r\nbrass, three culverins, two falcons, and eleven heavy iron guns among\r\nher 71 guns.[226] The curtall, or curtow, was a heavy gun of some 3000\r\nlbs., hitherto only used as a siege piece on land, and its transference\r\nto maritime use marks a revolution in ship armament which deserves\r\nattention. The _Mary Rose_ and _Sovereign_ were in 1509, the two most\r\npowerfully armed ships which had yet existed in the English navy, perhaps\r\nthe most powerfully armed ships afloat anywhere that year, and it is\r\ncurious to notice that the _Peter Pomegranate_ built with them was fitted\r\nin the old style, with innumerable serpentines which could have been of\r\nlittle more effect than toy guns, appearing almost as though the contrast\r\nwas an intentional experiment. At any rate with the heavier armaments\r\nof the _Sovereign_ and _Mary Rose_, commences the long struggle between\r\nthe attack and defence still going on, for hitherto there had been\r\npractically no attack so far as a ship’s sides were concerned.\r\n\r\nThe system was extended as the reign progressed, and in 1546, we find\r\ncomparatively small ships like the _Grand Mistress_ carrying two demi\r\ncannons and five culverins, the _Swallow_ one demi cannon and two demi\r\nculverins, out of a total of eight heavy guns; the _Anne Gallant_\r\nfour culverins, one curtall, and two demi culverins; the _Greyhound_\r\none culverin, one demi culverin, and two cannons petro,[227] besides\r\ntheir other smaller pieces.[228] Even the _Roo_ of 80 tons has two\r\ndemi culverins and three cannons petro. To measure the full extent of\r\nthe change we must compare these vessels with the _Henry_, of three or\r\nfour times their tonnage, which in 1514, carried only one bombard, two\r\nculverins, six falcons and one curtow, in addition to 126 serpentines and\r\n47 other guns of various but probably light weights, seeing that most of\r\nthem were used with chambers.\r\n\r\nTo whom was this innovation due? It commenced with Henry’s accession, and\r\nif not owing to his direct initiative, he has the merit of recognising\r\nits value and persistently putting it into execution. But we know from\r\nother non-naval documents that he had some knowledge of artillery and\r\ntook an active personal interest in such matters, and it may very well be\r\nthat the improvement was his own. In any case it was one in which England\r\ntook and kept the lead, and which gave the country an incalculable\r\nadvantage in the contest with Spain during the close of the century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Royal Ships:—Ordnance Stores.]\r\n\r\nFrom other papers we can ascertain with sufficient completeness the\r\ncharacter of the weapons and stores for offensive purposes carried on\r\nboard.

Bows\r\nand arrows still formed an important part of the equipment, but although\r\nwe have no similar list for shot the amount of powder shows the reliance\r\nnow placed on artillery and musket fire. Incidentally, among remains of\r\nstores, we find ‘200 harquebus shot,’ 900 serpentine shot, 1350 iron\r\n‘dyse,’ 8 darts for wildfire, to set the sails of an enemy’s ship on\r\nfire, and two chests of wildfire with quarrels.[233] Also ‘300 small and\r\ngrete dyse of iern,’ 420 stone and 1000 leaden shot, 120 shot of iron\r\n‘with cross bars,’ 22 ‘pecks for to hew gonstones’[234] and 74 arrows of\r\nwildfire.[235]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ships, Galleys and Galleasses.]\r\n\r\nThe well known picture of the embarkation of Henry VIII at Dover, on his\r\nway to the interview with Francis I in 1520, represents the _Henry Grace\r\nà Dieu_ as the chief ship in the fleet. This was inherently improbable as\r\nthe _Henry_ drew too much water to enter either Dover or Calais harbours,\r\nbut it can be proved to be incorrect from documentary evidence. The\r\nsquadron consisted of the _Great Bark_, _Less Bark_, _Kateryn Plesaunce_,\r\n_Mary and John_, and two rowbarges.[236] The interview was originally\r\nproposed for 1519 and a year previously on 22nd May 1518, the _Kateryn\r\nPlesaunce_ was commenced for the express purpose of carrying the King\r\nand Queen across the Channel.[237] She cost £323, 13s 9d, including\r\nthe victualling and lodging expenses of the men working upon her, and\r\nrequired 80 tons of ballast.[238] In none of the accounts relating to\r\nmen-of-war are there any details of extrinsic decoration, if it existed,\r\nand even in the _Kateryn_, intended for a royal pleasure trip there is\r\nonly one charge of ten shillings for painting and gilding the ‘collere.’\r\nHouse carpenters were employed for ‘the makynge of cabons and embowynge\r\nof wyndows,’ and although the chief cabin was wainscoted and lighted by\r\n112 feet of glass, the Queen’s own cabin was cheaply furnished with a\r\ndozen ‘joined stools’ at tenpence apiece.\r\n\r\nThe _Kateryn_ was sometimes called a bark and sometimes a galley and this\r\nleads us to the question of the classification of the royal vessels. If\r\nwe accept without inquiry that of the list of 5th January 1548,[239] we\r\nfind ships like the _Anne Gallant_, _Unicorn_, _Salamander_, _Tiger_,\r\n_Hart_, _Antelope_, _Lion_, _Dragon_, _Jennet_, _Bull_ and _Greyhound_,\r\ndescribed as galleys. But in Anthony’s list of 1546 the same vessels\r\nare called galleasses; obviously therefore the two words did not define\r\nparticular types as rigidly as they do among naval archæologists to-day,\r\nor even as they did towards the end of the sixteenth century. The\r\n_Kateryn_ galley of 1512 was a three masted vessel with bowsprit and\r\nfore and main topmasts, as was also the _Rose_ another ‘galley’ of the\r\nearly years of the reign.[240] Both were supplied with oars—thirty—as\r\nwas usual with small vessels long after this date when the name galley\r\nhad fallen into disuse. Another, the _Sweepstake_ (of Henry VII), had a\r\nmizen mast,[241] and a sprit mast on the bowsprit,[242] so that it may\r\nbe assumed that she also was a three-master although elsewhere she is\r\ndescribed as ‘the king’s rowbarge called the _Sweepstake_.’[243]\r\n\r\nIn 1546 the _Hart_, _Antelope_, _Tiger_, and _Bull_ are four-masted\r\nflush-decked ships, apparently pierced on a lower gun deck for nine\r\npieces a side; the _Anne Gallant_ and _Grand Mistress_ four-masters,\r\nof 450 tons, with forecastle and poop, carrying guns on the upper and\r\non a lower deck; the _Greyhound_, _Lion_, _Jennett_, and _Dragon_, are\r\nsimilar well-decked vessels with the addition of great stern and quarter\r\ngalleries extending nearly the whole length of the poop and nearly\r\none-third of the length of the vessel. The contradictions we have to\r\nface can be best exemplified by one example, the _Greyhound_, which in\r\nthe 1548 list is called a galley, in a 1546 list said to be a copy of\r\nAnthony’s,[244] a galleass, and in that portion of Anthony’s manuscript\r\nremaining in the Museum, a ship.[245] This last authority, a series\r\nof original drawings, calls only the _Greyhound_, _Lion_, _Jennett_,\r\nand _Dragon_, ‘ships’ and the only point in which they seem to differ\r\nfrom the ordinary type is in the possession of the stern and quarter\r\ngalleries. If these drawings are accurate, and they so far differ from\r\neach other as to lead us to suppose that they were intended to portray\r\nindividual ships, it is impossible that any one of them can have been\r\nimpelled by oars, although sweeps may have been occasionally and\r\ntemporarily used for a particular purpose. They may have been worked from\r\nthe gun-ports, in which case the _Grand Mistress_ could only have used\r\neight a side. The conclusion therefore is that the term galley did not\r\nimply an oared vessel of the Mediterranean type, such as we now associate\r\nwith the word, but was applied first to light ships small enough to\r\nuse sweeps when necessary, and later to an improved model, possibly\r\nbuilt on finer lines than the heavy, slow moving hulks of the beginning\r\nof the reign, and expected to bear, to the ponderous 600 or 1000 ton\r\nbattle ship, the same relation in speed that the real galley bore to a\r\nmediæval sailing vessel. A fleet formation of 1545 was of course based\r\non that customary in an army and we have Van, Battle or main body, and\r\nWing, arranged for. In that year some of the vessels just mentioned were\r\nnot yet afloat, but the _Salamander_, _Swallow_, _Unicorn_, _Jennett_,\r\n_Dragon_, and _Lion_ were included in the Battle. The Wing, composed of\r\n‘galliasses and ships with ores,’ comprised among others, the _Grand\r\nMistress_, _Anne Gallant_, and _Greyhound_. That they should have been\r\nclassed with ‘the ships with ores,’ does not show that they were of the\r\nsame order, but only that they were supposed to be sufficiently handy\r\nunder sail to act with them.\r\n\r\nThere was therefore a certain number of ships, large and small, vaguely\r\nand uncertainly called galleys, possessing certain modifications on the\r\nnormal type, and there is some reason to believe that the innovation,\r\nwhatever may have been the particular change in form or structure, was\r\ndue to Henry himself. He sometimes appears to have had his own designs\r\ncarried out; a prize was to be altered ‘so as she now shall be made in\r\nevery point as your Grace devised.’[246] In 1541 Chapuys wrote to the\r\nemperor:\r\n\r\n    ‘The King has likewise sent to Italy for three shipwrights\r\n    experienced in the art of constructing galleys, but I fancy\r\n    that he will not make much use of their science as for some\r\n    time back he has been building ships with oars according to a\r\n    model of which he himself was the inventor.’[247]\r\n\r\nChapuys must have been referring to the earlier _Rose_, _Kateryn_, and\r\n_Swallow_ type, and possibly to others not now to be traced; but to the\r\npresence of the Italian shipwrights was undoubtedly owing the launch of\r\nthe _Galley Subtylle_ in 1544. ‘Subtylle’ was not an especial name, but\r\nwas applied to a class more lightly built and quicker in movement than\r\nthe ordinary galley. This was the only real galley built by him since\r\nit differed in no respect from the standard Mediterranean pattern, but\r\nin 1546 thirteen ‘rowbarges’ of twenty tons apiece were added to the\r\nNavy. These were rowing vessels, and unless intended for scouting or\r\nfor towing and to give general assistance, it is difficult to see their\r\nutility as they were too small to engage with any chance of success. In\r\nthe result they were sold within a year or two of Henry’s death. The\r\nsixteenth century galley service, such as it was, was forced on the\r\nEnglish government by the action of Francis I in bringing his own and\r\nhired galleys round from the Mediterranean. It was always repugnant to\r\nthe national temperament and soon languished when the exciting cause was\r\nremoved. Although three or four galleys were carried on the navy list\r\nuntil 1629 the last years in which any served at sea were 1563 and 1586.\r\n\r\nThese various attempts at evolving a new type, which should combine\r\nthe best points of the galley and the sailing vessel, show that Henry\r\nrecognised at least some of the faults of the man-of-war of his day. He\r\nfailed because the solution was not within the scientific knowledge of\r\nhis time, and perhaps also because the work of the galley benches must\r\nhave been abhorrent to the hereditary instincts and traditions of the\r\nEnglish sailor. But he was the first English king who gave the Navy some\r\nof that forethought and effort at improvement that had hitherto been\r\ndevoted wholly to the army. His experiments left so little visible trace\r\nin the one direction that in 1551 Barbaro could write to the Seigniory,\r\n‘They do not use galleys by reason of the very great strength of the\r\ntides,’[248] but, in another, the drawings of the last ships launched,\r\nthe four of 1546, one of which, the _Tiger_, is reproduced in the\r\nfrontispiece—comparatively low in the water, little top-hamper, neat and\r\nworkmanlike in appearance—show a very great advance on anything before\r\nafloat, and indicate a steady progression towards the modern type.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Royal Ships:—Decoration and sailing qualities.]\r\n\r\nIf we are to judge of the decoration of ships by the references to\r\nornament in the naval accounts, we should have to conclude that it was\r\nentirely absent. Unquestionably it was to a certain extent present, since\r\nits absence would have been contrary to the instincts of humanity and the\r\ncustoms of every nation that has had a navy. But it could not have been\r\nas extensive as it afterwards became, nor have taken any very expensive\r\nform. The hulls were doubtless painted as in the previous reign, but the\r\nbows and stern seem to have been quite devoid of carving or gilding. The\r\ntops, which were large enough to hold heavy guns, were ornamented with\r\n‘top-armours’ of red, yellow, green, or white kersies lined with canvas.\r\nThe _Sovereign_ had copper and gilt ornaments on the end of the bowsprit,\r\nand gilt crowns for the mast heads had been an embellishment used for\r\ncenturies. The _Unicorn_ and _Salamander_ have representative figures on\r\ntheir beakheads,[249] but as they were prizes no deduction can be drawn\r\nas to English custom. The English built ships have no figurehead, but the\r\nbeakhead sometimes ends in a spur, implying the idea of ramming. This\r\nspur, however, points upward and is much too high to have been of any use\r\nfor that purpose. The ships’ sides were still surrounded with pavesses,\r\nnow only light wooden shields and decorations, but which were survivals\r\nof the real shields of knights and men-at-arms in ancient vessels, ranged\r\nround the sides of the ship until needed for fighting. A hundred years\r\nlater the cloth weather protection round the oarsmen of a Mediterranean\r\ngalley was still called the _pavesade_. These pavesses seem to have\r\nsometimes taken the place of bulwarks, not always present. In 1513 Sir\r\nEdward Echyngham, captain of a ship then at sea wrote that he had fallen\r\nin with three Frenchmen,\r\n\r\n    ‘Then I comforted my folk and made them to harness, and because\r\n    I had no rails upon my deck I coiled a cable round about the\r\n    deck breast high, and likewise in the waist, and so hanged upon\r\n    the cable mattresses, dagswayns,[250] and such bedding as I had\r\n    within board.’[251]\r\n\r\nThe form of expression suggests that the absence of rails was unusual.\r\n\r\nOf the rate of sailing attained by these ships and their weatherly\r\nqualities we know hardly anything. On 22nd March 1513 Sir Edward Howard\r\nwrote to Henry, evidently in answer to a royal command to make a report\r\non the subject, describing the merits of the squadron he had been trying,\r\napparently between the Girdler and the North Foreland.[252] The _Kateryn\r\nFortileza_ sails very well; the _Mary Rose_ is ‘your good ship, the\r\nflower I trow of all ships that ever sailed;’ the _Sovereign_, ‘the\r\nnoblest ship of sail is this great ship at this hour that I trow be in\r\nChristendom.’ Some time, but not long, before 1525 the _Sovereign_ was\r\nin very bad condition, and her repair was urged because ‘the form of\r\nwhich ship is so marvellously goodly that great pity it were she should\r\ndie.’[253] Her name however does not subsequently occur and she was\r\nprobably broken up. In 1522 Sir William Fitzwilliam related in a letter\r\nto the king that the _Henry_ sailed as well or better than any ship in\r\nthe fleet, that she could weather them all except the _Mary Rose_, and\r\nthat she did not strain at her anchors when it was blowing hard.[254] It\r\nseems rather late in the day for a trial of a vessel afloat in 1514, but\r\nsome alterations may have been previously made rendering it advisable.\r\nEven when ill and near his end Henry evinced the same interest in the\r\nseagoing qualities of his ships, since we learn from a letter of 1546\r\nthat he had required to be informed whether ‘the new shalupe was hable to\r\nbroke the sees.’\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Flags and Signals.]\r\n\r\nIf carving, gilding, and painting were scant on these ships they shone\r\nbravely with flags and streamers. Those of the _Peter Pomegranate_ were\r\nbanners of St Katherine, St Edward, and St Peter, six of the arms of\r\nEngland in metal;[255] of a Red Lion; four of the Rose and Pomegranate;\r\ntwo of ‘the castle,’ and eight streamers of St George.[256] The _Henry\r\nGrace à Dieu_ was furnished with two streamers for the main mast\r\nrespectively 40 and 51 yards long, one for the foremast of 36 yards, and\r\none for the mizen of 28 yards; there were also ten banners 3½ yards long,\r\neighteen more 3 yards long, wrought with gold and silver and fringed with\r\nsilk, ten flags of St George’s Cross, and seven banners of buckram, at a\r\ntotal cost of £67, 2s 8d.[257] Banners mentioned in other papers were,\r\nof England, of Cornwall, of a rose of white and green, of a Dragon, of a\r\nGreyhound, of the Portcullis, of St George and the Dragon, of St Anne, of\r\n‘white and green with the rose of gold crowned,’ of ‘murrey and blue with\r\nhalf rose and half pomegranate, with a crown of gold,’ and of ‘blue tewke\r\nwith three crowns of gold.’[258] White and green were now the recognised\r\nTudor colours, and there is some indication of their use in that sense\r\nin the reign of Henry VII; the Greyhound was the badge of that king,\r\nthe Dragon of his son. The Portcullis referred to the control of the\r\nstraits of Dover, the Pomegranate to Catherine of Aragon and Spain; the\r\nconstant recurrence of the Rose as a badge and as a ship’s name needs no\r\nexplanation. The banner with the representation of a saint upon it was a\r\nsurvival of the custom existing in earlier times, by which every ship was\r\ndedicated to a saint, under whose protection it was placed and whose name\r\nit usually bore.\r\n\r\nBesides ornament flags had long served the more prosaic purpose of\r\nsignalling. Even among merchantmen there seem to have been some\r\nrecognised signals, as in 1517 the _Mary of Penmark_, driven into Calais\r\nby bad weather, hoisted ‘a flag in the top,’ for a pilot.[259] This\r\nsignal must therefore have long been common to at least two seafaring\r\npeoples. So far as the Royal Navy was concerned, we can only say that\r\na flag ‘on the starboard buttock’ of the admiral’s ship called his\r\ncaptains to a council.[260] But a system of day and night signalling had\r\nlong been in existence in the Spanish service, and in view of the close\r\nconnection between the two countries commercially, and the employment of\r\nSpanish ships and seamen by the crown, it would have been extraordinary\r\nhad it not been known and used here. According to Fernandez de\r\nNavarrete[261] a scheme of signals for day and night use was practised in\r\n1430. In 1517 a flag half way up the main mast called the captains to the\r\nflagship; sight of land was announced by a flag in the maintop; a strange\r\nship by one half way up the shrouds, and more than one strange sail by\r\ntwo flags placed vertically. A ship requiring assistance fired three\r\nguns, and sent a man to wave a flag in her top, while if the admiral’s\r\nship showed a flag on her poop, every captain was to send a boat for\r\norders. A code with guns and lights made the corresponding signals during\r\ndarkness and fog.[262]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fleet Regulations.]\r\n\r\nThe earliest set of regulations for the government of a fleet in this\r\nreign is contained in an undated paper entitled ‘A Book of Orders for the\r\nWar by Se and Land,’ prepared by Thomas Audley by command of Henry.[263]\r\nThe articles relating to sea matters, and dealing with the management of\r\na fleet may be thus summarised:—\r\n\r\n    1. No Captain shall go to windward of his Admiral. 2.\r\n    Disobedient captains shall be put ashore. 3. No ship to ride in\r\n    the wake of another. 4. If the enemy be met the weather-gage\r\n    is to be obtained; only the Admiral shall engage the enemy’s\r\n    Admiral, and every ship is, as nearly as possible to attack an\r\n    opponent of equal strength. 5. Boarding not to be undertaken\r\n    in the smoke, nor until the enemy’s deck had been cleared\r\n    with small shot. 6. If a captured ship could not be held the\r\n    principal officers were to be taken out of her, the vessel\r\n    ‘boulged,’ and ‘the rest committed to the bottome of the sea\r\n    for els they will turne upon you to your confusion.’ 7. When\r\n    going into action the Admiral is to wear a flag at his fore and\r\n    main, and the other ships at the mizen. 8. The Admiral shall\r\n    not enter an enemy’s harbour, nor land men without calling a\r\n    council.\r\n\r\nFrom the last regulation it would appear that only limited authority\r\nwas left to the admiral, and it was perhaps due to Sir Edward Howard’s\r\nactions of 1512 and 1513, the last of which, an attempt to cut out\r\ngalleys, was a defeat, and cost Howard his life. From the second it seems\r\nthat little disciplinary power was left in the admiral’s hands, and from\r\nthe seventh that it was not customary to fly the colours at sea. It will\r\nbe observed, from the methodical way in which the captains were directed\r\nto go into action, that the tendency was still strong to handle a fleet\r\nas troops and companies were handled ashore.[264]\r\n\r\nThe next fleet orders show little alteration.[265]\r\n\r\n    1. Every ship shall retain its place in the Van, Battle, and\r\n    Wing, and every captain take his orders from the commander of\r\n    his own division. 2. In action the Van shall attack the French\r\n    Van, Admiral engage Admiral, and every captain a Frenchman of\r\n    equal size. 3. The Wing shall always be to windward so that it\r\n    may ‘the better beate off the gallies from the great ships.’ 4.\r\n    The watchword at night to be ‘God save King Henry,’ when the\r\n    other shall answer ‘Long to raigne over us.’\r\n\r\nThis fleet is the first recorded to have been opened into divisions, each\r\nsection being distinguished by the position of a flag. The Lord Admiral\r\nflew the royal arms in the main top and the St George’s cross at the\r\nfore, while the other ships of the ‘battaill’ carried the St George at\r\nthe main. The admiral commanding the Van wore the St George’s cross at\r\nthe fore and main, and the rest of his command the same flag at the fore.\r\nThe officer commanding the Wing flew the St George in both mizen tops and\r\nthose under him in one.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Lords Admirals.]\r\n\r\nThe hour of the professional seamen had not yet come for either admirals\r\nor captains. Like most of Henry’s executive or administrative officers\r\nthey were taken from among the men he saw daily round him at court. It\r\nwould be unfair to suppose this the cause that the Navy did little during\r\nhis reign, for the very existence of a powerful fleet is often reason\r\nenough why its services should not be needed. It was not until 1545 that\r\nthe French made any real attempt to contest the command of the sea. In\r\nthat year John Dudley, Lord Lisle, afterwards Duke of Northumberland,\r\ncommanded the English forces, and, in a position where some of Sir\r\nEdward Howard’s bull like tactics might have been judicious, he failed\r\nto come _aux prises_ with his adversary.[266] If we may believe his own\r\nconfessions he distrusted his powers and recognised his incapacity, but\r\nin after years, when the aggrandisement of his family was concerned, he\r\nshowed no such hesitating modesty. On one occasion he wrote to Henry\r\nadmitting his want of experience but expressing a hope that ‘the goodness\r\nof God’ would serve instead.[267] On another, he said, ‘I do thynck I\r\nshuld have doon his Maiestie better service in some meaner office wherein\r\nto be directed and not to be a director.’[268] If honestly felt this\r\nframe of mind was hardly calculated to inspirit his subordinates.\r\n\r\nAlthough the office of admiral as a commander of a fleet dates from\r\nthe thirteenth century it was for long only a temporary appointment,\r\nobtaining its chief importance from the character of the person holding\r\nit. When several fleets were at sea and the principal command was vested\r\nin one person he became for the time, Admiral of England, laying down\r\nhis title with his command. From the beginning of the fifteenth century\r\nthis office of ‘Great Admiral of England, Ireland and Aquitaine’ became a\r\npermanent one, carrying with it the control of all the maritime strength\r\nof the crown, and being usually bestowed on a relative of the sovereign.\r\nThe first of such patents is of 23rd Dec. 1406, and bears a resemblance,\r\nin the powers and privileges it confers, to the similar ones of the\r\nAdmiralship of Castile, that can hardly be accidental.[269] But as far as\r\nthe navy was concerned his duties were purely militant, and there is no\r\ntrace of his interference in administration.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Great Admiral’ also possessed jurisdictive functions, trying, by his\r\ndeputy, all maritime causes, civil and criminal. The fees and perquisites\r\nattached to the exercise of these duties made the post valuable in the\r\nfifteenth century, but it does not appear to have ensured any especial\r\npolitical power to its holder during that troubled time.\r\n\r\nFrequently it became a mere court title of honour; the Earl of Oxford\r\nwas Great Admiral during the whole reign of Henry VII, but his name\r\nnever occurs in naval affairs. In many instances, during the fifteenth\r\ncentury, the Admiral of England did not command at sea at all, but during\r\nthe reign of Henry VIII the post became one of actual executive control,\r\nand, later, of administrative responsibility. The Lords Admirals of this\r\nreign were mostly men who, before or afterwards, held other important\r\nState or Household appointments and who had no expert knowledge of their\r\nduties. The Earl of Oxford was succeeded by Sir Edward Howard by Letters\r\nPatent of 15th August 1512; his brother, Lord Thomas Howard, son of the\r\nvictor of Flodden, was appointed 4th May 1513; Henry, Duke of Richmond,\r\nillegitimate son of the King, 16th July 1525; William Fitzwilliam, Earl\r\nof Southampton, 16th August 1536; John, Lord Russell, 18th July 1540; and\r\nJohn Dudley, Lord Lisle, 27th January 1543. That most of these men had no\r\nexperience whatever of the sea was not considered detrimental to their\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Royal Ships lost.]\r\n\r\nThere were not many men-of-war lost during Henry’s reign, but both\r\nabsolutely and relatively, seeing the little active service undergone\r\nby the Navy, the number is much larger than under Elizabeth. The\r\n_Regent_ was burnt in action in 1512. In 1513 a ship commanded by Arthur\r\nPlantagenet, an illegitimate son of Edward IV, sank after striking on\r\na rock in Bertheaume Bay, near Brest, but we are ignorant whether she\r\nwas a man-of-war or a hired merchantman, probably, however, the latter.\r\nSometime in or before 1514, a small vessel, name unknown, was wrecked at\r\nRye,[270] but a more important loss was that of the _Great Elizabeth_, in\r\nSeptember 1514, at Sandgate, west of Calais, during the passage of the\r\nPrincess Mary to France when 400 men were drowned.[271] The _Christ_,\r\nfreighted to the Mediterranean for trade, was, in 1515, captured by\r\nBarbary corsairs and all but thirty of those on board killed. Letters\r\npatent were issued, authorising a national subscription for their ransom.\r\nThe next was that of the _Anne Gallant_, in August 1518, on the coast of\r\nGalicia while chartered by some London merchants on a trading voyage.\r\n\r\nIn 1545 several foreign hired fighting ships were wrecked by stress\r\nof weather, but the most remarkable loss of the reign was that of the\r\n_Mary Rose_ which capsized off Brading on 20th July 1545, when getting\r\nunder way. Ralegh says that her ports were only sixteen inches above the\r\nwater line, and attributes the disaster to this circumstance. Beyond the\r\nfact that most of Ralegh’s observations on maritime matters, where not\r\ndoubtful or unintelligible, can be shown to be incorrect,[272] there is\r\nthe great improbability that after at least fifty years’ experience of\r\ngun-ports they should have been cut so low since she had been rebuilt\r\nin or before 1536. Moreover Anthony’s drawings show them to have been\r\npierced very much higher in other vessels. A contemporary writer, who\r\nobtained his account from an eye-witness, ascribed it to a different\r\ncause and makes no mention of the ports.[273]\r\n\r\nBy the 1st August measures had been taken towards raising her and the\r\npersons who had undertaken the work desired,\r\n\r\n    ‘Ffyrst ii of the gretest hulkes that may be gotten, more the\r\n    hulk that rydeth withyn the havyn, Item iiii of the gretest\r\n    hoys withyn the havyn, Item v of the gretest cables that\r\n    may be had, Item x grete hawsers, Item x new capsteynes with\r\n    xxᵗⁱ pulleyes, Item l pulleyes[274] bownde with irone Item v\r\n    doseyn balast basketts, Item xl lb of talowe, Item xxx Venyzian\r\n    maryners and one Venyziane carpenter, Item lx Inglysshe\r\n    maryners to attend upon them, Item a greate quantitie of\r\n    cordage of all sortes, Item Symonds patrone and maister in the\r\n    ffoyst doth aggree that all thynges must be had for the purpose\r\n    aforeseid.’[275]\r\n\r\nIt appears from this that cables were to be passed through her ports, or\r\nmade fast to her, and that by means of the hulks she was to be bodily\r\nhauled up, a course from which rapid success was anticipated. On the 5th\r\nAugust, her yards and sails had been removed and ‘to her mastes there is\r\ntyed three cables with other ingens to wey her upp and on every side of\r\nher a hulk to sett her uppright.’[276] Two days later the officers at\r\nPortsmouth fully expected that she would be weighed within twenty-four\r\nhours,[277] but on the 9th\r\n\r\n    ‘Thitalians which had the doying for the wayeing of the _Mary\r\n    Roos_ have been with my Lord Chamberlayn and me to signifie\r\n    unto us that after this sourt which they have followed,\r\n    hithierto, they can by no meanes recover her for they have\r\n    alredye broken her foremast ... and nowe they desyer to prove\r\n    another waye which is to dragg her as she lyeth untill she come\r\n    into shallowe ground and so to set her upright, and to this\r\n    they axe vi days’ proof.’[278]\r\n\r\nThe second way proved as fruitless as the first, but we read that 22 tuns\r\nof beer were consumed during the work, which must have made it appear an\r\nenjoyable summer outing to the men.[279] Up to 30th June 1547, the whole\r\namount expended in the various attempts was £402, 6s 8d[280] and this may\r\nhave included £57, 11s 5d to Peter Paul, an Italian, for the recovery\r\nof some of her guns, which was paid within the time for which the total\r\nwas made up but appears in other papers.[281] The last reference to the\r\nunfortunate ship is another payment of £50 to Peter Paul for recovering\r\nordnance and then, after four years of effort, any further hope was\r\nforegone.[282]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Royal Ships hired by Merchants.]\r\n\r\nDuring the greater part of his reign, Henry like his predecessors,\r\nallowed merchants to charter men-of-war for trading voyages. In 1511,\r\n£200 was paid for the _Mary and John_ by two merchants who hired her\r\nto go to the Baltic, a five months’ voyage, but out of this sum the\r\nking paid the wages of the crew and supplied flags and doubtless other\r\nstores.[283] One reason for putting royal officers and men on board may\r\nhave been to prevent the ship being used for piratical purposes. In the\r\nsame year the _Anne Gallant_ also went to the Baltic,[284] and from there\r\nto Bordeaux before returning to London, and the _Peter Pomegranate_ to\r\nZealand; in 1515 Richard Gresham freighted the _Mary George_, and Richard\r\nFermor the _Christ_, to the Mediterranean. For the _Anne Gallant_ the\r\ncrown received £300, and for the crew of the _Peter_ 100 ‘jorgnets’ were\r\nprovided.[285] When the _Anne Gallant_ was wrecked in 1518 the loss seems\r\nto have been submitted to arbitration, ‘for the copyinge of the byll\r\nof the grosse averies of the same _Anne Gallant_ and the warde of the\r\narbetrers theruppon made iiˢ,’ but there is no trace of the result.[286]\r\nIn 1524, the _Minion_ and _Mary Guildford_ were at Bordeaux, and in 1533,\r\ntwo other vessels. After that year there is no further instance known of\r\nHenry permitting his ships to be hired by private persons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Convoys.]\r\n\r\nConvoys were provided by the government during war time. In 1513, the\r\nRoyal Navy being fully occupied on service, £55 was paid to the owner of\r\nthe _Mawdelin_ of Hull for escorting a wool fleet to Calais, and there\r\nare other similar agreements.[287] In the preceding year there was a\r\nguard of the herring fleet afloat, although we have no knowledge of its\r\nstrength.[288] In 1522 we have the first sign of an attempt to patrol\r\nthe four seas, four vessels were stationed between the Thames and Rye,\r\nfour others between Rye and the Channel Islands, and three are assigned\r\nto the somewhat unintelligible location of between the Channel Islands\r\nand the Tweed.[289] Doubtless it was only a temporary measure, but it is\r\nimportant as showing that it was now understood that the Navy had a more\r\ncontinuous purpose than mere attack or defence in fleets.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dockyards:—Portsmouth.]\r\n\r\nPortsmouth dockyard, with the storehouses and workshops attached to it,\r\nand said to have been situated at that portion of the present yard known\r\nas the King’s Stairs, was the only one existing in 1509. The enlargement\r\nof the Navy necessitated a corresponding increase in the accommodation\r\nfor building and repairs, and naturally the first references are to\r\nPortsmouth. In the first year of the reign there are payments for ‘the\r\nbreaking up of the dockhead where the _Regent_ lay—having put the said\r\nship afloat out of the same dock into the haven of Portsmouth—making\r\na scaffold with great masts for the sure setting on end of her main\r\nmast,’[290] and £1175, 14s 2d was expended there on the _Sovereign_.[291]\r\nDuring the first war with France, additions were made to the\r\nestablishment,[292] and from a later paper we learn that five of these\r\nwere brewhouses, the Lion, Rose, Dragon, White Hart and Anchor,[293]\r\nwhile some ‘reparrynge and tylinge of the houses att the dokke,’ was also\r\nexecuted. In other respects the town was cared for, since in 1526, 675\r\npieces of ordnance were on the walls and in store, and in the same year\r\n£20 was spent on repairing the dock.\r\n\r\nIn 1523, however, the existing dock must have been much enlarged in view\r\nof the charges ‘for making a dock at Portsmouth for the king’s ship\r\nroyal,’ the _Henry Grace à Dieu_.[294] She was brought into the dock with\r\nmuch ceremony,\r\n\r\n    ‘the same day that the King’s Ship Royal the _Henry Grace à\r\n    Dieu_ was had and brought into the dock at Portsmouth of and\r\n    with gentlemen and yeomen dwelling about the country there\r\n    which did their diligence and labour there in the helping of\r\n    the said ship, and also with mariners and other labourers in\r\n    all to the number by estimation of 1000 persons.’[295]\r\n\r\nThese assistants consumed during their arduous labours through the\r\nday eight quarters of beef, forty-two dozen loaves of bread and four\r\ntuns of beer. The method of construction was still the same as under\r\nHenry VII, as there are payments for ‘digging of clay for the stopping\r\nup of the same dock head,’ and for breaking up these solid fabrics.\r\nThe next event connected with the Portsmouth yard was the purchase of\r\nnine acres of land, in 1527, at twenty shillings an acre; this ground\r\nwas surrounded by a ditch and hedge with gates at intervals.[296] The\r\ndockyard however gradually sank in consideration during this reign.\r\nWoolwich and Deptford soon disputed supremacy with it, and the gradual\r\nformation of Chatham yard between 1560 and 1570 completed its decay. Its\r\nlast year of importance was 1545, when the fleet collected there, and\r\nwhen its approaching neglect was so little anticipated that the chain\r\nacross the mouth of the harbour was renewed and fresh improvements were\r\ncontemplated. But from that year until the era of the Commonwealth it\r\nalmost disappears from naval history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dockyards:—Woolwich.]\r\n\r\nWoolwich, commonly but erroneously called the Mother Dock, grew up round\r\nthe _Henry Grace à Dieu_. The accounts[297] show various amounts expended\r\nin the hire of houses and grounds there for purposes associated with the\r\nship, and some of these were converted into permanent purchases. One such\r\noccurred in 1518 when the king bought a wharf and houses from Nicholas\r\nPartriche, an alderman of London, for £100,[298] but the Longhouse,\r\nand perhaps others had been built in 1512. In 1546 the yard was again\r\nenlarged by the addition of docks and land belonging to Sir Edward\r\nBoughton, which were obtained by means of an exchange of property; these\r\ndocks had been leased by the crown for at least seven years previously at\r\n£6, 13s 4d a year.[299]\r\n\r\nIn connection with Woolwich we find a description of the office\r\nformalities necessary when a ship was moved from one place to another. In\r\n1518 the _Henry Grace à Dieu_ and the _Gabriel Royal_ were brought from\r\nBarking creek, the first to Erith, and the second to Woolwich, and among\r\nthe expenses incurred were payments\r\n\r\n    ‘To John Dende scryvenor in Lombarde Strette for certen\r\n    wrytyngs and bylls made by hym for the Kyngs lysences to my\r\n    office, belongynge, that is to seye, for one warraunte made\r\n    to Master Comely, the Kinges attorney, xiiᵈ, and for a letter\r\n    to rygge the schippes viiiᵈ, and for a warraunte to have the\r\n    schippes owt of Barkyn Creke, viiiᵈ, and for ii comyssions made\r\n    to provide all things concernynge the same schippes, iiˢ, and\r\n    for divers copyes of the same xviᵈ.’[300]\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful however whether a dry dock existed at Woolwich at this\r\ntime. In this particular instance there is a payment to John Barton,\r\n‘marshman,’ for the making ‘of the _Gabriel Rialls_ docke the sixteenth\r\ndaye of Marche anno dicto in grett when the seid shipp most be browght\r\napon blokks xxxˡⁱ’.[301] Seventeen men were at work and this cannot refer\r\nto a dry dock which would have required more men and much more money;\r\nit seems to have been a graving place in which the vessel was shored\r\nupon blocks. But when the _Henry_ was being built the charges include\r\nthe travelling expenses of men from Southampton and Portsmouth ‘for the\r\nmakynge of the dokkehede,’ and ‘to break up the dokhede.’\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dockyards:—Deptford.]\r\n\r\nThe formation of Deptford is usually assigned to 1517, when John Hopton,\r\ncomptroller of the ships, undertook, for 600 marks, to ‘make and cast a\r\npond’ in a meadow adjoining the storehouse, and to build\r\n\r\n    ‘A good hable and suffycient hed for the same pond and also\r\n    certyn hable sleysis through the which the water may have entre\r\n    and course into the foresaid ponde as well at spryng tydes as\r\n    at nepetydes.’[302]\r\n\r\nIt was to be of sufficient size to take the _Great Galley_, _Mary Rose_,\r\n_Great Bark_, _Less Bark_, and _Peter Pomegranate_. There is some\r\nevidence that a pond with an inlet communicating with the river, was in\r\nexistence in the thirteenth century, in which case Hopton only adapted\r\nand improved it. The storehouse can be traced back to 1513,[303] but it\r\nis possible that the building hired at ‘Greenwich’ in 1485, by Henry VII\r\nwas really at Deptford, seeing that Deptford Strand was sometimes called\r\nWest Greenwich; if so its beginnings are older than Portsmouth. Even in\r\n1513 there is a reference to ‘the howse at the dockhede,’ but in 1518,\r\nwhen the _Great Nicholas_ was brought to Deptford for repair, there are\r\ncharges for putting her into the dock, for ‘making the same dockhed,’\r\n‘for pylinge of the dockhede,’ and for ‘scouring out the dokk at the este\r\nende of the Kyngis storehouse.’ There was also made ‘a myghty hegge of\r\ngrete tesarde and tenets[304] along the seid dockside and the retorne\r\nof the same;’ in the same year a wharf and two sheds were built.[305]\r\nThe use made of Deptford grew steadily until by the end of the reign it\r\nhad become the most important yard. In 1546-7 more storehouses had to be\r\nhired at a cost of £17, 18s 8d for the year, while £1, 6s 8d covered the\r\nextra payments for the same purpose at Woolwich, and no such temporary\r\naugmentation was required at Portsmouth.[306]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dockyards:—Erith.]\r\n\r\nThere seems at one time to have been intention to make Erith a permanent\r\nnaval station. By Letters Patent of 12th January 1513-4, John Hopton\r\nwas appointed ‘keeper of the new storehouses at Deptford and Erith for\r\nsupplying the king’s ships.’ On 18th February £32 was paid to Robert Page\r\nof Erith for\r\n\r\n    ‘The purches of a tenement with an orchard and gardeyn and\r\n    othir appurtenaunces thereunto belonging, conteigning foure\r\n    acres of ground, being and sett in the parish of Erith by us\r\n    of hym bought upon the which ground we have newe edified and\r\n    bilded a house called a storehouse for the saffe kepyng of\r\n    our ordynaunce and habillamentes of warre belonging to our\r\n    shippes.’[307]\r\n\r\nIn 1521 the fittings, guns, and ground tackle of some of the ships were\r\nkept here, and shortly before that the sills of the doors had been raised\r\n‘for the keepinge owt of the hye tydis for att every tyde affore ther was\r\nii ffoote depe of water in the seide storrhowsse.’ At this date there\r\nwere 88 bolts of canvas, 219 cables and hawsers, 27 masts, and 25 guns\r\nbesides powder, pikes, bows and blocks in the house, which must have been\r\nof good size. We do not know the circumstances that led to its disuse,\r\nbut long before the end of the reign Erith ceases to be mentioned in\r\nconnection with naval affairs.\r\n\r\nIf we were to assume that the docks, so frequently spoken of in official\r\npapers, were all dry docks, we should have to conclude that there\r\nwere nearly as many in existence then as now. There can, however, be\r\nno doubt that the term was applied indifferently to a complete dock\r\nwith gates, to a graving place, and even to a temporary protection of\r\ntimber, fitted round a ship afloat to protect it from the ice. At Erith,\r\nin 1512-13 there was ‘a new docke’ made, in which the _Sovereign_ was\r\nplaced and repaired, the dock and repairs together occupying only eight\r\nweeks.[308] But in 1526 the construction of a dock at an estimated cost\r\nof £600 was suggested, so that it is certain that one did not exist\r\nthere previously.[309] In another instance John Barton and twenty-three\r\nmarshmen were paid for _two_ days’ work while they ‘cast and made a dock\r\nfor the _Grett Galey_ affore the towne of Depfforde Stronde for the\r\nsuer keepinge of her ther owt of the ysse.’[310] Subsequently certain\r\nships are said to have been brought ‘into their dock’ after they had\r\nbeen aground for breaming and floated again;[311] in such a case it\r\nseems to have meant only a mooring place. At Portsmouth in 1528 a number\r\nof labourers were ‘working by tide for the making of a dock for the\r\ngrounding of the _Mary Rose_, _Peter Pomegranate_, and _John Baptist_,’\r\nwhich vessels were ‘wound aground by certain devices.’[312] These\r\nexamples show clearly that the word when found in a sixteenth century\r\npaper, must be understood in a far wider sense than is customary to-day.\r\nNevertheless there are references which seem to imply that there were\r\nother docks than those in the government yards. In 1513 men were engaged\r\nin ‘casting and closing the dockhede with tymber bord and balyste at\r\nRatcliffe,’ and another one at Limehouse is also mentioned.[313]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shipwrights and Workmen.]\r\n\r\nThere was as yet no large resident population of shipwrights and others\r\nat the naval centres chosen by the government. For the _Henry Grace\r\nà Dieu_ workers were brought from districts far afield. Plymouth,\r\nDartmouth, Bere Regis, Exeter, Saltash, Bradford, Bristol, Southampton,\r\nBodmin, Exmouth, Poole, Ipswich, Brightlingsea, Yarmouth, Hull, Beverley,\r\nYork, and other places furnished contingents. Most of the men came from\r\nthe south and west, but of single towns Dartmouth and Ipswich supplied\r\nthe largest numbers. While travelling to and returning from the scene\r\nof their employment they received a halfpenny a mile, known as conduct\r\nmoney, for food and lodging, and the agents sent to press them were paid\r\none shilling a day.[314] Probably the call to the royal service was not\r\nunpopular as all classes of workmen were boarded and lodged in addition\r\nto their wages; under Henry VII they were victualled, but there is no\r\nmention of free lodging.\r\n\r\nShipwrights received from twopence to sixpence a day, sawyers, caulkers,\r\nand pumpmakers, twopence to fourpence, smiths twopence to sixpence, and\r\nlabourers from twopence to fivepence. The staff at Portsmouth included\r\na chip-bearer and a chip-gatherer at sevenpence a day, so that at this\r\ntime ‘chips’ did not constitute the scandalous perquisite it afterwards\r\nbecame. Of the carpenters working on the _Henry Grace à Dieu_, 141 were\r\nsupplied with ‘coats’ costing from two to five shillings each, but that\r\nwas a nearly exceptional expenditure, although 164 were provided for\r\nthe men building the _Mary Rose_ and _Peter Pomegranate_. The cost of\r\nvictualling averaged twopence halfpenny a day, and they were given bread,\r\nbeef, beer, ling, cod, hake, herring, pease, and oatmeal. There were\r\ncooks to prepare their food and a ‘chamberlyn’ to make the beds which\r\nwere bought or hired for their use; flockbeds and mattresses cost from\r\n3s 4d to 5s, bolsters 1s and 1s 6d, sheets 2s to 3s, blankets 1s 4d,\r\nand coverlets 1s to 2s.[315] Sometimes flock beds and mattresses were\r\ntemporarily procured for twopence, and feather beds for threepence a\r\nweek. The beds were made to hold two or three men, and in at least one\r\ninstance ten men were packed into three beds. By 1545 wages seem to have\r\nrisen somewhat, since at Deptford and Portsmouth that year the pay and\r\nvictualling of all classes—carpenters, smiths, labourers, caulkers, and\r\nsawyers—came to ninepence a day.\r\n\r\nThe principal designers and master shipwrights were John Smyth, Robert\r\nHolborn, and Richard Bull, who were in 1548 granted pensions on the\r\nExchequer of fourpence a day ‘in consideration of their long and good\r\nservice, and that they should instruct others in their feats.’[316]\r\nJames Baker, the only master shipwright whose reputation outlived his\r\ngeneration, is not mentioned among these men, but he is elsewhere spoken\r\nof as ‘skilful in ships,’[317] and he possessed a pension, also from the\r\nExchequer, of eightpence a day. In the reign of James I he was still\r\nremembered and said to have been the first who adapted English ships\r\nto carry heavy guns, a survival which, whether exactly correct or not,\r\ntestifies to an exceptional skill in his art. In 1546 Baker got into\r\ntrouble by being in possession of some forbidden religious books, and it\r\nis likely that only his professional ability saved him. Henry ordered\r\nthat he should be examined, but ‘His Maiestie thynketh you shall find\r\nhim a very simple man, and therefore wold that without putting him in any\r\ngreat fear you should search of him as much as you may.’ Evidently the\r\nking knew him well, and had doubtless often discussed shipbuilding with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe famous Pett family who furnished a succession of celebrated\r\nshipbuilders between the reigns of Mary I and Mary II, were not yet\r\nprominent. In 1523 a Peter Pett is among the shipwrights, pressed from\r\nEssex and Suffolk, who were working at Portsmouth, and there is a yet\r\nearlier mention of a payment of £38, 1s 4d to a John Pett for caulking\r\nthe _Regent_ in 1499.[318] A recent writer,[319] in a Pett pedigree,\r\ngives Thomas Pett of Harwich as the father of the first well known Peter\r\nPett who died in 1589. It is therefore possible, but scarcely probable,\r\nthat this was the Peter Pett who was working in 1523 as a boy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Officers and Men:—Pay and Clothing.]\r\n\r\nBy the treaty of 1511, between Henry and Ferdinand, the former undertook\r\nto hold the Channel between the Thames and Ushant with 3000 men, of whom\r\nsome 1600 were sailors and gunners.[320] For the fleet of 1513, exclusive\r\nof the crews of 28 victualling ships, 2880 seamen were required;[321] in\r\n1514, during the month ending with 22nd May, there were 23 king’s ships,\r\n21 hired merchantmen, and 15 victuallers in commission manned by 3982\r\nseamen and 447 gunners, exclusive of the soldiers carried as well.[322]\r\nWhen maritime action in force recommenced in 1545, it was estimated that\r\n5000 men would be wanted which ‘wilbe some dyffycultie.’ Beyond this one\r\nexpression there is no hint of any trouble having been experienced in\r\nprocuring these men although the numbers were larger than those which\r\nCharles I, a century later, found it almost impossible to obtain. As the\r\nproportion allowed theoretically was two men to a ton[323] the ships were\r\nmuch more heavily manned than in the seventeenth century, but in practice\r\nthe crews do not usually work out at one man to a ton, even including\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nHenry’s success was due in a great measure to the fact that the men were\r\npunctually paid and fairly well fed, two elementary incentives to loyal\r\nservice neglected during the two succeeding centuries. In his first war\r\nof 1512 he entered into an agreement with the admiral, Sir Edward Howard,\r\nby which the latter, being supplied with ships, men, and money, had the\r\nwhole administration placed in his hands, having to pay wages and find\r\nprovisions and clothes.[324] In every subsequent expedition the admiral’s\r\nduties were only executive. The rate of pay was five shillings a month,\r\nand at this it remained during nearly the whole reign, but in addition,\r\na certain number of dead shares, or extra pays, the division of which is\r\nsomewhat obscure, were allotted to each ship. They are first met with\r\nduring the war with France in 1492, and, at that time, in connection\r\nwith the pay of the soldiers serving on board the fleet. Subsequently\r\nthe favour was extended to the maritime branch, and was perhaps intended\r\nto replace the ‘reward’ of sixpence a week in addition to their pay,\r\nwhich had been enjoyed by the seamen in preceding centuries. But if the\r\ndead shares were at any time divided among the sailors they speedily\r\nlost the privilege, and early in the reign we find the shares, reckoned\r\nat five shillings apiece, reserved for the officers. There are a few\r\napparent exceptions, perhaps due to our ignorance of the exact sixteenth\r\ncentury meaning of the words used. The wages bill of the _Katherine_ of\r\nLondon[325] distinctly says that the dead shares are divided between\r\n‘master and mariners,’ and there are some other similar cases, _e.g._\r\n‘168 dead shares to be divided among the mariners.’[326] But in the vast\r\nmajority of references they are seen to be meant for the officers.\r\n\r\nThe number of course depended on the size of the ship, and for the _Henry\r\nGrace à Dieu_ they were thus distributed[327]:—Master —; master’s mate,\r\n4; four pilots, 16; four quartermasters, 12; quartermaster’s mates, 4;\r\nboatswain, 3; boatswain’s mate, 1½; cockswain, 1½; cockswain’s mate,\r\n1; master carpenter, 3; carpenter’s mate, 1½; under-carpenter, 1; two\r\ncaulkers, 3; purser, 2; three stewards, 3; three cooks, 3; cook’s mates,\r\n1½; two yeomen of the stryks, 2; their mates, 1; two yeomen of the ports,\r\n2; their mates, 1. The officers’ pay was the same as that of the men,\r\nbut they received in addition either these dead shares, reckoned at five\r\nshillings each, in the proportion shown here, or ‘rewards’ of so much a\r\nmonth. The _Peter Pomegranate_ may be taken as a representative ship,\r\nas the _Henry_ carried some officers unknown in the smaller vessels.\r\nIn the _Peter_ the master obtained one pound ten shillings a month of\r\ntwenty-eight days; the master’s mate and quartermasters ten shillings;\r\nthe boatswain twelve shillings and sixpence; master gunner, carpenter,\r\npurser, steward and cook, ten shillings, and gunners six shillings and\r\neightpence. Surgeons were paid ten shillings and thirteen shillings and\r\nfourpence, and pilots twenty and thirty shillings a month, but neither\r\nwere always carried.[328] Within certain limits, however, officers’ wages\r\nvary considerably, depending on the number of dead shares allotted among\r\nthem, which, again, was subject to the size of the ship, an indication of\r\nthe commencing division into rates. But before Henry’s death the formula\r\nof pay ran ‘dead shares and rewards included’ for an average, exclusive\r\nof captains, of eight shillings a month[329] all round, so that the old\r\nsystem was beginning to be discarded.\r\n\r\nFor many years of the reign some sort of uniform in the shape of ‘coats’\r\nor ‘jackets’ was supplied to the men, but its exact character is nowhere\r\ndescribed. When the _Mary Rose_ and _Peter Pomegranate_ were brought\r\nround from Portsmouth to the Thames thirty-five coats in green and\r\nwhite were provided, but as the cost was 6s 8d apiece these could only\r\nhave been for the officers.[330] Sir Edward Howard, by his agreement in\r\n1512, had to furnish the sailors with them at 1s 8d each, and he appears\r\nto have charged for 1616 besides 1812 for the soldiers.[331] Masters\r\nand pilots had sometimes coats of damask, every coat containing eight\r\nyards.[332] In 1513, we find references to 1244 mariners’, gunners’, and\r\nservitors’, jackets,[333] and to 638 coats of white and green cloth, 13\r\nof white and green camlet, 4 of satin, and one of damask.[334] Although\r\nindications of uniform for the men have been noticed under Edward IV and\r\nHenry VII, the provision was much more liberal when Henry ascended the\r\nthrone. He had at first an overflowing treasury wherewith to minister to\r\nhis love of display and carry out more completely a custom he may also\r\nhave thought useful from the point of view of health and of making the\r\nmen proud of the royal service. But the allusions to seamen’s clothes are\r\nfew after the first years. The system appears to have lasted, although\r\nperhaps not continuously, until his death, since in 1545 the writer of an\r\nestimate of naval charges asks if 1800 seamen are to have coats at two\r\nshillings each.[335]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sick and Wounded Men.]\r\n\r\nSick men appear to have been kept in pay if landed for that reason,\r\nbecause when Sir Thomas Wyndham proposed to send such members of his\r\ncrew ashore, the council preferred that he should keep them on board as\r\nthey would only be receiving pay uselessly on land and might not come\r\nback.[336] Those discharged disabled from wounds sometimes received\r\na gratuity; in 1513, sixty men of the _Mary James_ sent home in that\r\ncondition were given twopence a mile conduct money, the usual rate being\r\na halfpenny a mile, and a gift of £20 among them.[337]\r\n\r\nUntil 1545, there is no record of exceptional disease in fleets, but\r\nin September of that year the plague broke out in the English ships,\r\nalthough as the French were suffering even more and were eventually\r\ncompelled by it to disband their fleet, it did not adversely affect the\r\nresult of the operations. In August there were many men sick which was\r\nascribed ‘to the great hete and the corrupcion of the victuall by reason\r\nof the disorder in the provision and the strayte and warm lying in the\r\nshippes.’[338] On the 28th August Lisle wrote to Paget that there was\r\nmuch illness, ‘those that be hole be veray unsightlie havyng not a ragg\r\nto hang uppon ther backes.’ On 3rd September, Lisle landed at Treport\r\nin Normandy, and sacked and burnt the town, and it is not until after\r\nthat date that the word ‘plague’ is used and the terrible disease raged\r\nvirulently. On 4th September there were 12,000 effective men, soldiers\r\nand sailors; on the 13th, 8488, so that in little more than a week 3512\r\n‘were sick, dead, or dismissed,’[339] By 11th September, Lisle was\r\nback at Portsmouth and wrote to the king that the ships were generally\r\ninfected. Although the fleet was then broken up, it seems to have\r\nlingered on in the vessels kept in commission through the winter as there\r\nare references to it in the following April.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Captains.]\r\n\r\nThe captains of men-of-war were still usually military officers or\r\ncourtiers who made no attempt to work the ship. They were for the most\r\npart, persons holding appointments in the household, but towards the\r\nend of the reign, the new feeling that the sea was as important as the\r\nland as a field of national effort had trained officers who were almost\r\nprofessional seamen. These men belonged to the class who would earlier\r\nhave been content to command soldiers during a voyage, but who were now\r\ncontinuously occupied in commanding ships at sea or in attending to\r\nadministrative details ashore. Nominally a captain’s pay was one shilling\r\nand sixpence a day, but there were frequently extra allowances. In 1513,\r\nWalter, Lord Ferrers, captain of the _Sovereign_ received five shillings\r\nand two pence a day ‘by way of reward’ over and above his one shilling\r\nand sixpence,[340] and Sir William Trevilian of the _Gabriel Royal_,\r\nthree shillings and fourpence a day. On the other hand captains who\r\nhappened to belong to the troop of ‘King’s Spears’ were paid ‘out of the\r\nKing’s cofers’ and took nothing from the navy expenses.[341] The King’s\r\nSpears were a troop of Horseguards, fifty in number, formed by Henry\r\nshortly after his accession. Each of them was attended by an archer,\r\nman-at-arms, and servant, ‘they and all their horses being trapped in\r\ncloth of gold, silver, or goldsmith’s work.’ Eventually want of money led\r\nto the disbandment of this force.\r\n\r\nIn 1545 the demand for captains exceeded the supply for the smaller\r\nships, the circumstances perhaps promising neither fame nor prize money.\r\nThe official total of men-of-war and armed merchantmen under Lisle’s\r\ncommand was 104 ships, the strongest fighting fleet as yet sent to sea.\r\nAbout some of these he wrote,\r\n\r\n    ‘As concernynge the meane[342] shippes I know noon other waye\r\n    (I meane those that come out of the west parties and such of\r\n    London, as were victuallers that want capitaignes) but to place\r\n    them with meane men to be their capitaignes as serving men and\r\n    yomen that be most mete for the purpose.’[343]\r\n\r\n‘Meane men’[344] here signifies those of moderate social status, and\r\nserving men the confidants or attendants of noblemen, and who were\r\nfrequently gentlemen themselves.\r\n\r\nIn 1546 a Spaniard was retained as captain of the _Galley Subtylle_ and\r\na Venetian as its patron, or master, but as they were provided with an\r\ninterpreter the crew must have been English.[345] This is a further proof\r\nof the little experience native officers had of galley work; apparently\r\nthe English captain of the preceding year had not been found efficient.\r\nWhether the crew were seamen or criminals is not quite certain; the term\r\n‘forsathos’[346] is used but only in connection with the French prize,\r\nthe _Galley Blancherd_, which was undoubtedly manned by prisoners, its\r\noriginal crew. In more ways than one this prize seems to have been a\r\nsource of trouble to its captors. To keep the men in condition constant\r\npractice was essential, ‘Richard Brooke ... keptt me company as far as\r\nGravesend to kepe the forsados in ure and breth as they must contynewally\r\nbe otherwyse they wilbe shortly nothing worth.’ Most of the captives\r\nwere Neapolitans, with the habits of their class, and Brooke desired new\r\nclothes ‘for all the said forsados who he saith are most insufferable\r\nwithout any manner of things to hang upon theym. So that I perceyve the\r\nsame galley will be some chardge to His Maiestie contynewally, yf His\r\nHighnes do keep her styll with her suit of forsadoes as she ys now.’[347]\r\nLisle urged that if the _Blancherd_ was restored at the conclusion\r\nof the war the prisoners should be granted their liberty. Perhaps he\r\nmay have thought it advisable to get rid of them on any terms, but the\r\nargument he pressed was that such a course would make the French chary,\r\nat any future time, of bringing their galleys near English ports or ships\r\nif the slaves on board knew that surrender meant freedom.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ship Discipline.]\r\n\r\nYet another diplomatist, Dr William Knight, found ‘the ungodly manners of\r\nthe seamen’ not to his liking, and so far as the scanty material permits\r\nus to judge, they appear to have been an unruly and disorderly race.\r\nDiscipline in the modern sense was of course unknown, and such restraints\r\nas existed sat but lightly on both royal and merchant seamen. An undated\r\npaper, but which is probably earlier than 1530, discussing the causes\r\nof the decay of shipping, describes the men as ‘so unruly nowadays that\r\nther ys no merchantman dare enterpryse to take apon hym the orderyng and\r\ngoverning of the said shippes.’[348] Even the government dealt with them\r\ngently, and when in 1513, the crew of a man-of-war were discontented with\r\ntheir captain, Sir Weston Browne, the Vice-Admiral was directed, if he\r\ncould not pacify them, to replace Browne.[349] Sometimes whole crews went\r\nashore, and when the French attacked Dover in 1514, the king’s ships in\r\nharbour there lay uselessly at their anchors for want of men. One sailor,\r\nEdward Foster, was examined at Portsmouth in 1539, before the Mayor and\r\ntwo admiralty officials for saying that ‘if his blood and the King’s were\r\nboth in a dish, there would be no difference between them, and that if\r\nthe Great Turk would give a penny a day more he would serve him.’[350]\r\nOne would like to know what happened to this matter-of-fact physiologist.\r\n\r\nRegulations existed for the maintenance of order on board ship, and\r\nwere ‘set in the mayne mast in parchement to be rid as occasion shall\r\nserve.’[351] A murderer was to be tied to the corpse and thrown overboard\r\nwith it; to draw a weapon on the captain involved the loss of the right\r\nhand; the delinquent sleeping on watch[352] for the fourth time was to\r\nbe tied to the bowsprit with a biscuit, a can of beer, and a knife,\r\nand left to starve or cut himself down into the sea; a thief was to be\r\nducked two fathoms under water, towed ashore at the stern of a boat, and\r\ndismissed. Only a boat from the flagship was to board a stranger to make\r\ninquiries, as the men ‘would pilfer thinges from oure nation as well\r\nof the kinges dere frends,’ but in a captured ship all plunder, except\r\ntreasure, between the upper and lower decks was allotted to them. It is\r\ninteresting, as showing Henry’s desire to avoid giving needless offence,\r\nto compare this order, about the manner in which strange ships were to be\r\nvisited, with another issued at the end of the reign. It was still more\r\nimpressively worded. Neutrals were to be ‘gently’ examined, and if no\r\nenemies’ goods found in them not to be harmed. And ‘the violation of our\r\npleasure in this behaulf is of such importance as whosoever shalbe found\r\nculpable therein, we shall not faile so to look upon him as shall be to\r\nhis demerits.’[353]\r\n\r\nIn addition to regulations which, if not new as maritime customs, were\r\nnew as a code of discipline we find that crews were now assigned stations\r\non board ship, an essential towards smartness in work, but one which\r\nso far as we know had no previous existence. The station list—or one\r\nof them—of the _Henry Grace à Dieu_ has come down to us, and although\r\nno similar paper exists for any other ship it cannot be supposed that\r\nan improvement in method and working, of which the advantages must at\r\nonce have made themselves felt, could have failed to have been generally\r\nadopted.[354] This list gives:—\r\n\r\n  The forecastle 100 men; waist 120\r\n  In the second deck for the main lifts, 20\r\n  In the said deck for the trin and the dryngs,[355] 20\r\n  To the stryks[356] of the mainsail, 8 principal men\r\n  To the bonaventure top, 2\r\n  The little top upon the fore top, 2\r\n  For the boat 40; the cok, 20\r\n  Main capstandard[357] and main sheets, 80\r\n  In the third deck to the topsail sheets, 40\r\n  To the bonaventure and main mizen, 20\r\n  To the helm, 4 men\r\n  To the main top 12; to the fore top, 6; to the main mizen top, 6\r\n  The little top upon the main top, 2\r\n  The little top upon the main mizen top, 2\r\n  The gellywatte, 10.[358]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these signs of orderly training the loss of the _Mary\r\nRose_ was attributed solely to the insubordination and disorder of those\r\non board. Her captain, Sir George Carew, being hailed when matters looked\r\nserious answered that ‘he had a sort of knaves whom he could not rule.’\r\nBut these men had been chosen for the Vice-Admiral’s ship as especially\r\ngood sailors and therefore ‘so maligned and disdained one the other that\r\nrefusing to do that which they should do were careless to do that which\r\nwas most needful and necessary and so contending in envy perished in\r\nfrowardness.’[359]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Victualling.]\r\n\r\nUntil very recent times the victualling on board ship was a source of\r\ncontinual anxiety to the authorities, and of grumbling and vexation to\r\nthe men; and even in the time of Henry VIII it appears to have given\r\nmore trouble than any of the other details of administration. There was\r\nno victualling department until 1550, and either local men were employed\r\nat the ports where supplies were to be collected or others were sent\r\nfrom London to make the purchases. Commissions to provide provisions\r\nwere given to persons attached to the household, or to highly placed\r\nofficials with sufficient influence to obtain them. In 1496 John Redynge,\r\nclerk of the Spicery, was victualling both the land and sea forces on\r\nservice.[360] In July 1512, Sir Thomas Knyvet, Master of the Horse, was\r\nsupplying the fleet and undertaking the responsibility of transport;\r\nin October, John Shurly, Cofferer of the Household, and John Heron,\r\nSupervisor of the London Customhouse.[361] Between 1544-7 numerous agents\r\nwere employed and were subject to no central control, unless a reference\r\nto the Lord Chamberlain, Lord St John, afterwards Marquis of Winchester,\r\nas ‘a chief victualler of the army at the seas’ may be held to imply his\r\ngeneral superintendence.\r\n\r\nIn 1512 the cost of provisioning each man stood at one shilling and\r\nthreepence a week. There were some complaints that year, but in 1513\r\nSir Edward Howard, like many a later admiral, was begging earnestly\r\nfor stores, ‘let provision be made, for it is a well spent penny that\r\nsaveth the pound.’ A captain, William Gonson, finding that he was running\r\nshort, wrote to the Council that unless he received fresh supplies for\r\nhis men, ‘I cannot keep them in order, for if we lack victuals and wages\r\nat anytime as well Spaniards as Englishmen shall murmur.’ That also was\r\nan experience many later captains were to find commonplace. Most of the\r\nvictualling difficulties in subsequent reigns were due to want of money\r\nor to absolute knavery, but the embarrassments at this date seem to have\r\nbeen as much caused by lack of organisation due to want of experience\r\nin the supply of large fleets longer at sea than formerly. There is,\r\nhowever, a letter of Howard’s, belonging to 1512 or 1513, which shows\r\nthat roguery was already at work: ‘they that receved ther proportion for\r\nii monthes flesche cannot bryng about for v weekes for the barelles be\r\nfull of salt, and when the peecis kepith the noumbre wher they shulde\r\nbe peny peces they be scante halfpeny peces, and wher ii peces shulde\r\nmake a messe iii will do but serve.’[362] Short measure was therefore a\r\nfrequent experience. In April 1513 a convoy reached the fleet off Brest\r\njust in time, ‘for of ten days before there was no man in all the army\r\nthat had but one meal a day and one drink.’ After Howard’s death, when\r\nthe captains of the fleet returned to Dartmouth, and they were asked why\r\nthey had come back, ‘they all replied for default of victuals not having\r\nthree days allowance.’[363] The pursers, a class who move through naval\r\nhistory loaded with the maledictions of many generations of seamen, were\r\nalready condemned. It is doubtless in connection with the return of the\r\nfleet that two officials wrote on the same day, ‘I fear that the pursers\r\nwill deserve hanging for this matter,’ and ‘an outrageous lack on the\r\npart of the pursers.’[364] It may have been the experiences of 1512 and\r\n1513 that led to an order in September of the latter year, of which there\r\nis no previous example that the vessels named for winter service should\r\nbe provisioned for two months at the time.[365] They were directed ‘to\r\nvictual at Sandwich from two months to two months during four months.’\r\nAlthough the regulation remained in force, Surrey complained in 1522\r\nthat some of his ships had only supplies for eight days instead of\r\ntwo months.[366] In 1545 the French were said to carry two months’\r\nstores.[367]\r\n\r\nVictualling stores and requisites were obtained by purveyance, and there\r\nwas not consequently much eagerness displayed to sell to the crown.\r\nThere is a proclamation of 1522 ordering, under penalty of £5, every\r\none possessing casks to put them out of doors that the King’s purveyor\r\nmight take them at ‘a reasonable price,’ one, that is to say, to be fixed\r\nby him. The prices paid for provisions, are, therefore, no absolute\r\nindication of the market rates, but the following are some for this\r\nperiod.[368]\r\n\r\n  Biscuit       (1512) 3s 6d and 5s a cwt.\r\n   Do.          (1554) 7s 6d a cwt.\r\n  Salt beef     (1512) £1, 11s a pipe\r\n   Do.          (1544) £3, 12s a pipe\r\n  Beer          (1512) 13s 4d a tun\r\n   Do.          (1547) 16s and 21s a tun\r\n  Red Herring   (1513) 5s the cade\r\n   Do.          (1547) 9s 6d and 11s the cade\r\n  White Herring (1513) 10s a barrel\r\n   Do.          (1547) 21s a barrel\r\n\r\nBy 1545 the rate had run up to eighteenpence a week per man, or perhaps\r\nmore,[369] and two months’ provisions were estimated to occupy 83 tons\r\nof space in 100 ton ship with a complement of 200 soldiers and sailors.\r\nA pound of biscuit and a gallon of beer a day were allowed to each man,\r\nand ‘200 pieces of flesh’ to every hundred men on four days of the\r\nweek. Beer was the recognised right of the sailor, and the exigencies of\r\nwarfare had to yield to his prerogative. After Surrey captured Morlaix\r\nin 1522, he announced his intention of going on a cruise and of not\r\nreturning ‘as long as we have any beer, though in return we should drink\r\nwater.’[370] Evidently it was considered out of the question to remain\r\nat sea without beer, and again when Lisle was off the French coast in\r\n1545 he gave pointed expression to the fear that if the victuallers did\r\nnot arrive ‘a good meynye of this fleet may happen to drynck water.’ The\r\npayments for provisions from September 1542 until the death of Henry in\r\nJanuary 1547, amounted to £65,610 10s 4½d,[371] and we can still trace\r\nthe proceedings of the various agents at Sandwich, Lowestoft, Portsmouth,\r\nYarmouth, and Southampton. ‘Necessary money,’ an allowance to the\r\npursers for candles, wood, etc., was in operation according to the ‘old\r\nordinance’ at the rate of twopence a man per month.[372]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The new Administration.]\r\n\r\nThe increase in the navy and the additional work caused by the\r\nmobilisation of fleets necessitated an augmentation from the first on\r\nthe administrative side of the department though no systematic and\r\npermanent change was made until the close of the reign. Brygandine\r\nremained clerk of the ships till about 1523; in that year he was granted\r\na release—a customary proceeding—for all embezzlements or misdemeanours\r\ncommitted while in office, and this probably means that he resigned\r\nthen or shortly afterwards.[373] But although he had been the chief\r\nadministrative officer, he was now by no means the only one even during\r\nhis term of service, though it is not easy to define the exact duties\r\nand responsibilities of his associates. The fleets of 1513-14 carried a\r\n‘Treasurer of the Army by Sea,’ in the person of Sir Thomas Wyndham,[374]\r\nwho was also allowed one shilling and fourpence a day for two clerks, and\r\nBrygandine had nothing to do with payments made for stores or wages in\r\nthese ships.\r\n\r\nIn 1513 John Hopton, a gentleman usher of the chamber was given charge\r\nof the fleet conveying troops to Calais,[375] and from that time until\r\nhis death Hopton was closely connected with naval affairs. In 1514 he\r\nwas made keeper of the storehouses at Erith and Deptford, with a fee of\r\none shilling a day, and as such received under his charge the fittings\r\nof the ships dismantled and laid up that year; it has been noticed that\r\nhe contracted for the work required for the formation or enlargement of\r\nthe pond at Deptford in 1517. He was an owner of ships and sold at least\r\none to the king, and, in the same year, he is called ‘clerk comptroller\r\nof the ships.’ His duties must have been mainly clerical and financial,\r\nfor we have many separate series of payments made by him to Brygandine\r\nwho seems to have retained the active direction of executive work, and\r\ncertain passages in the records known as the _Chapter House Books_,\r\nseem to imply that they were written under his supervision. Hopton held\r\na definite appointment, but there are others mentioned as employed in\r\npurchasing stores, travelling for certain purposes, or in charge of\r\nordnance taken out of the ships, who can only have held temporary and\r\nsubordinate situations. There were sometimes local clerks of the ships,\r\nas at Portsmouth when Thomas Spert was given ‘the rule of all the forsaid\r\nships, maisters, and maryners with the advise of Brygandine.’[376] Here,\r\nhowever, the whole control was really in the hands of the customers of\r\nSouthampton who were ordered to provide the money requisite, muster\r\nthe men once a week, and exercise a general oversight. Again, in 1529,\r\nEdmund More, of whom nothing is known beyond this single reference, was\r\nacting as clerk of the ships at Portsmouth. When there was only one naval\r\ncentre the clerk of the ships resided there, but after the foundation\r\nof Woolwich and Deptford his place was in London, and the local clerk\r\nrepresented the later Commissioner in charge of a dockyard.\r\n\r\nHopton died in or before July 1526,[377] and had been succeeded from\r\n1524 by William Gonson, also a gentleman usher of the king’s chamber, as\r\nkeeper of the storehouses at Erith and Deptford.[378] Although in 1523\r\nThomas Jermyn was the recognised Clerk of the Ships,[379] and in 1533\r\nLeonard Thoreton,[380] Gonson, who also commanded ships at sea, soon\r\nbecame the dominant official. He is found equipping men-of-war, directing\r\ntheir movements and making payments for wages, victualling, and the\r\npurchase of necessaries, but notwithstanding the extent of his authority\r\nhe does not seem to have held any titular rank. In 1538 Sir Thomas Spert\r\nwas Clerk of the Ships,[381] but appears to have had very little to do\r\nunless Gonson happened to be suffering from gout. Spert was followed by\r\nEdmund Water, another gentleman usher of the chamber, who held his office\r\nby patent, neither Jermyn, Thoreton nor Spert acted under Letters Patent,\r\nand in the absence of an enrolled appointment, they were doubtless\r\nconsidered merely acting officials.\r\n\r\nLarge payments to Gonson can be traced down to 1545. Then for the first\r\ntime we have the titles of ‘Treasurer of the See,’ ‘Paymaster of the\r\nSee,’ and ‘Treasurer of the See Maryne Causes’[382] as describing John\r\nWinter, who, however, died in less than a year. It was possibly the\r\nloss of William Gonson’s practised experience, and dissatisfaction with\r\nhis successors, which helped to move Henry to make in 1546, the most\r\nimportant change in naval administration that had yet occurred. In one\r\nday the naval organisation was revolutionised. By Letters Patent of the\r\n24th April 1546, Sir Thomas Clere was constituted Lieutenant of the\r\nAdmiralty, with a fee of £100 a year, ten shillings a day for travelling\r\nexpenses when engaged on the business of his office, £10 a year for boat\r\nhire and twentypence a day for two clerks; Robert Legge, ‘Treasourer of\r\nour maryne causes’ with 100 marks a year, six shillings and eightpence\r\na day for travelling expenses, eight pounds a year for boat hire, and\r\nsixteenpence a day for two clerks; William Broke, ‘Comptroller of all our\r\nshippes,’ with £50 a year, four shillings a day for travelling expenses,\r\neight pounds for boat hire, and sixteenpence a day for two clerks;\r\nBenjamin Gonson,[383] ‘Surveyor of all our shippes,’ with £40 a year,\r\nthe same travelling allowance and boat hire as the comptroller, but only\r\neightpence a day for one clerk; Richard Howlett, Clerk of the Ships,\r\nwith £33, 6s 8d a year, three shillings and fourpence a day travelling\r\nexpenses, and six pounds for boat hire. William Holstock and Thomas\r\nMorley were granted annuities of one shilling a day without specific\r\nduties, but they were both employed in assisting the other officers. All\r\nthese fees were paid from the Exchequer. By another patent of the same\r\nday, the supply of guns, powder, and other ordnance necessaries for the\r\nNavy was placed under the direction of Sir William Woodhouse, called\r\n‘Master of the Ordnance of the ships,’ at a fee of 100 marks a year, six\r\nshillings and eightpence a day travelling expenses, eight pounds a year\r\nfor boat hire, and two shillings and fourpence a day for three clerks.\r\nThe stores were still kept at the central office in the Tower, and became\r\nseparate from, if subordinate to, the old Ordnance Office, remaining so\r\nuntil 1589.\r\n\r\nIt would be of great interest to know exactly the motives moving Henry to\r\nthe formation of—to use a later name—the Navy Board. Beyond discontent\r\nwith the administration in 1545, the accessions of 1546 suggest that it\r\nwas his intention to still further strengthen the Navy, and experience\r\nhad doubtless shown that the old organisation was too inelastic for\r\nmore than a limited number of ships acting within a restricted sphere.\r\nHitherto fleets had carried troops, landed them, and returned home; or\r\ngone to sea, fought the enemy, and returned home; but now the era of\r\nlong cruises was commencing, and the transition necessarily involved\r\nadditional administrative work with which the clerk of the ships or the\r\ncomptroller could not alone cope. Another subject of inquiry is the\r\nmodel on which the board was formed. It was not derived from any foreign\r\npower, for the organisation was then, and long afterwards, superior to\r\nand unlike, anything existing abroad. The similarity of many of the\r\ntitles and of their corresponding duties suggests that it was copied\r\nfrom the constitution of the Ordnance Office, which Henry had also\r\nremoulded to suit the altered conditions of warfare. The Lieutenant of\r\nthe Admiralty, acting under the Admiral of England, as the Lieutenant of\r\nthe Ordnance acted under the Master General, was intended to be the most\r\nimportant member of the board. But after the death of Clere’s successor,\r\nSir William Woodhouse, the post was not filled up and the Treasurership\r\nexercised by an expert official like Benjamin Gonson, or a great seaman\r\nlike Hawkyns, speedily became the chief administrative office. Another\r\ncause of the Treasurer’s ascendancy is to be found in the fact that he\r\nhad to be a man of some capital, able and willing to advance money to\r\nthe crown. He was to have allowance for all moneys laid out if his books\r\nwere signed ‘by two or three’ of the other officers.[384] Originally\r\nthis may only have been intended to apply to all moneys received from\r\nthe Exchequer and expended by him, but the yearly accounts show that it\r\nsoon became a normal condition for the crown to be indebted to him for\r\nadvances.\r\n\r\nTwo other officers found their positions altered by the new development.\r\nThe Lord Admiral had been till now only a combatant officer; from this\r\ndate he interfered more or less frequently and directly in matters of\r\nadministration for which he was nominally responsible. But while the\r\nmembers of the Navy Board were men of weight and reputation his action\r\nmainly took the course of agreeing with the advice given him. Under\r\nthe new arrangement the Clerk of the Ships became a very subordinate\r\nofficer. More than a century later Pepys claimed that the clerk possessed\r\nfrom former times a consultative and equal voice with the other\r\nofficers. It would be difficult to disprove it, and it is true that the\r\nsignature of the clerk appears sometimes—but only sometimes—attached to\r\ndocuments with those of his colleagues. In 1600, however, his duties are\r\ndistinctly said to be confined to registering the resolutions of the\r\nboard generally.[385] At especially busy periods he shared the active\r\nwork of superintendence but ordinarily only the Treasurer, Comptroller,\r\nand Surveyor, are found to be exercising authority, and the gradual\r\nalteration of his title from Clerk of the Ships to Clerk of the Acts is\r\nitself a sign that his functions had become purely secretarial.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hired Ships.]\r\n\r\nBesides English vessels, Henry hired Spanish during the earlier years\r\nof his reign and Hanseatic during the later ones, England being on\r\nmuch more friendly terms with Spain in 1509 than in 1547. One or two\r\n‘Arragoseys,’ _i.e._ Ragusans were in pay, that republic being a\r\nmaritime power of some importance in the fifteenth century. The English\r\nships taken up for the crown were mostly employed as victuallers and\r\ntenders, and were therefore not required to be large and do not afford\r\nany measure of the magnitude of the merchant navy. In April 1513 there\r\nwere thirty-nine impressed of 2039 tons, and of these the largest was\r\n140 tons; twenty-eight of them were serving as victuallers, one being\r\nusually attached to each of the largest men-of-war.[386] The rate of\r\nhire was one shilling a ton per month, for both victuallers and fighting\r\nships, and the wages, victualling, and dead shares were the same as on\r\nking’s ships; jackets were frequently provided for the crews as for\r\nmen-of-war’s men. Another account gives a list of twenty-two English\r\nvessels of 3040 tons, and six Spanish of 1650 tons as having served.[387]\r\nThe Spaniards were manned by 289 Spanish and 181 English seamen, with 869\r\nEnglish soldiers and a majority of English officers. Henry had to pay a\r\nhiring rate of fifteenpence a ton for them, and 7s 1d a month to Spanish\r\nseamen, 4s 9d to gromets, and 2s 5d to pages, while the dead shares\r\nallotted to the foreigners were at six shillings each instead of the\r\nfive shillings of the Englishmen. The difference of pay must have caused\r\na great deal of jealousy but the king’s attempts to obtain Spaniards at\r\nthe standard rate had failed.[388] The _Mary of Bilboa_ was taken up at\r\nfifteenpence-farthing and a half-farthing a month, terms which imply a\r\ngood deal of higgling.[389] In 1514 there were twenty-one hired fighting\r\nships and fifteen victuallers engaged. The former measured 2770 tons, and\r\nincluded one of 300, one of 240, one of 200, and three of 160 tons.[390]\r\n\r\nIn 1544 twenty-two foreign ships, now mostly Hanseatic, of 1465 tons were\r\nstill obtaining fifteenpence a ton, and 379 men in them seven shillings\r\nand sixpence a month, while the English pay remained at five shillings,\r\nand thirty-five hired English vessels received their one shilling a\r\nton.[391] In the same year the expedition against Scotland required 117\r\ntransports of which London furnished 6, Calais 2, Amsterdam 1, Dordrecht\r\n1, Antwerp 4, Hamburg 5, Lubeck 2, Ipswich 31, Yarmouth 31, Newcastle 6,\r\nHull 6, and Lynn 4.[392] English owners did not show themselves eager to\r\nsend their ships to join the royal fleet and it was necessary to issue a\r\ncircular letter in August 1545, to the mayors of the various ports which\r\nran:—\r\n\r\n    ‘Fforasmuch as I understand that dyvers and many of the\r\n    adventurers that are appointed for Portsmouth ... do slacke\r\n    and drawe back from the same being rather gyven to spoyle\r\n    and robberye than otherwise to serve His Maiestie and making\r\n    ther excuses for lack of necessaries do showe themselves not\r\n    wyllynge to serve the kyng’s Maiestie according to their\r\n    diewties’\r\n\r\nthey were ordered to go to Portsmouth immediately on pain of death.[393]\r\nTheir disinclination to be shackled by the discipline of a fleet can be\r\nunderstood when we find Lisle writing to Paget that ‘nother Spanyard,\r\nPortugell, nor Flemynge that cometh from by south but they be spoylid\r\nand robbid by our venturers.’ The successful privateering of 1544, when\r\n300 French prizes were taken,[394] was assuredly joyously remembered and\r\nsimilar good fortune hoped for. If there is no exaggeration in Stow’s\r\naccount the event is remarkable as the first instance of our sweeping\r\nthe Channel on an outbreak of war, and signifies the steady growth of a\r\nmarine able to perform the work.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Merchant Navy.]\r\n\r\nThe materials for an estimate of the strength of the merchant navy are\r\nscanty, but we find in this reign a commencement of the plan largely\r\nextended under Elizabeth, of obtaining returns of the vessels belonging\r\nto various ports. Henry, moreover, followed the example of his father\r\nin granting a bounty on large ships. In 1520 an allowance of four\r\nshillings a ton was ordered on the customs due for the first voyage\r\nof the _Bonaventure_ of London of 220 tons; in 1522 five shillings a\r\nton on the _Antony_ of Bristol, of 400 tons, because she was good for\r\ntrading purposes and ‘also to doo unto us service in warre.’[395] The\r\nwording of the warrant rather implies, however, that the _Antony_ was a\r\npurchase from a foreign owner. In 1521 four shillings a ton was paid on\r\nthe _John Baptist_ of Lynn of 200 tons, and in 1530 five shillings a ton\r\non the _John Evangelist_ of Topsham of 110 tons. If there was any rule\r\nregulating the apportionment of the bounty it is impossible to define\r\nit now. In 1544 there is a payment of five shillings a ton on the _Mary\r\nJames_ of Bristol of 160 tons ‘to corage othre our subgetts to like\r\nmakyng of shippes.’[396] There were doubtless many more similar grants\r\nbut which were not issued in a form which ensured their survival in the\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\nIn 1513 Bristol had nine vessels of 100 tons and upwards ready to join\r\nthe royal fleet. Of these one was of 186 tons, one of 120, one of 130,\r\nthree of 110 and three of 100 tons.[397] It is significant of the little\r\nreliance that can be placed on statements of tonnage that, in another\r\npaper, the one of 186 tons is given as of 160, one of 110 as 140 and the\r\none of 120 as of 100. In the case of merchantmen the discrepancies may\r\nperhaps be attributed to the fact that it was to the interest of the\r\nowner of a hired merchantman to measure his ship at as high a tonnage as\r\npossible, as he was paid by the ton, while the navy authorities acting\r\nin the interest of the crown desired to rate it as low as they could. In\r\nthe case of men-of-war the tonnage, unless they had actually performed a\r\ntrading voyage and stowed goods, could only have been by estimate, which\r\nwould explain a difference of 100 or 150 tons in the supposed measurement\r\nof a large ship.\r\n\r\nIn 1528, there were 149 vessels engaged in the Iceland fishery all\r\nwhich, with the exception of 8 from London, belonged to the east coast\r\nports. Yarmouth sent 30, Cley, Blakeney, and Cromer 30, and Dunwich,\r\nWalderswick, Southwold, and Covehithe 32. To the herring fishery in the\r\nNorth Sea went 222, of which the Cinque Ports sent 110 and the east coast\r\nthe remainder. Trading to Scotland were 69 ships of which only 6 sailed\r\nfrom London.[398] This return was used years afterwards to show the\r\nprosperous condition of these trades as compared with a later period when\r\nthe number of vessels employed had greatly fallen off; except that it is\r\nendorsed in Cecil’s handwriting the date of the comparison is unknown.\r\nFor 1533, there is a certificate of the ships returned from Iceland that\r\nyear, 85 in number, of which 6, of from 50 to 100 tons, belonged to\r\nLondon; 10, of from 35 to 95 tons to Lynn; 14, of from 40 to 95 tons to\r\nYarmouth; 7, of from 60 to 150 tons to Orwell haven; and 17, of from 30\r\nto 90 tons to Wells and Blakeney.[399] Unless they were trading vessels,\r\nused on occasion for the Iceland fishery, the average tonnage seems\r\nvery high for North Sea fishing boats of that century. Nearly 700 sail\r\nwere reputed to enter Calais harbour every year and ‘at the least’ 340\r\nforeign herring boats also traded there.[400] These figures point to a\r\nflourishing local trade round the coasts and in the fisheries, but there\r\nare only three returns relating to ships of larger size and they do not\r\ngive particulars for more than a few ports;—[401]\r\n\r\n  +-------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n  |             |Tons |Tons |Tons |Tons |Tons |Tons |\r\n  |             | 100 | 110 | 120 | 130 | 140 | 160 |\r\n  |             +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n  | Minehead    |  1  |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  | Burton[402] |     |     |  1  |     |     |     |\r\n  | Lynn        |  1  |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  | Cley        |  1  |  1  |     |     |     |     |\r\n  | Yarmouth    |  6  |     |     |     |  1  |     |\r\n  | Lowestoft   |  1  |     |  3  |     |     |     |\r\n  | Aldborough  |  1  |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  | Hull        |  1  |  1  |  2  |  1  |  1  |     |\r\n  | Newcastle   |  7  |     |     |  1  |     |  1  |\r\n  +-------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n\r\nThere were 99 other vessels of from 40 to 100 tons also sailing from\r\nthese ports; but if the table were complete and included London,\r\nBristol, Southampton, and Dartmouth—to name no others—we should infer a\r\nsurprisingly large total from the 32 belonging to these towns. Foreign\r\nobservers, men representing a maritime state like Venice, considered the\r\nsea strength of England much greater than would be assumed from the few\r\nsources of information we possess. In 1531, the Venetian representative\r\nreported that Henry could arm 150 sail;[403] in 1551, Barbaro thought\r\nthat the crown could fit out 1500 sail of which ‘100 decked’[404] and in\r\n1554, Soranzo remarked that there were ‘great plenty of English sailors\r\nwho are considered excellent for the navigation of the Atlantic.’[405]\r\nThese Venetians paid especial attention to the English marine and in no\r\ninstance do they write of it depreciatingly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Trade and Voyages.]\r\n\r\nCommerce does not appear to have progressed in a ratio corresponding\r\nto its growth during the close of the fifteenth century. Trade had\r\nbeen then recovering the position lost through the unsettled political\r\nstate previously existing, and had benefited under a king who made its\r\nexpansion the keynote of his policy. Half a century had brought it\r\nrelatively into line with that of other countries, and thenceforward its\r\nincrease was no longer a question of regaining a standard already once\r\nattained, but of competition with other powers whose trade was marked\r\nout on definite lines. This accounts for the comparatively stationary\r\ncondition of commerce under Henry, and until new factors came into play\r\nunder different circumstances. According to Hakluyt voyages to the\r\nLevant were frequent until 1534 but then fell off.[406] In that year\r\nRichard Gonson, son of William Gonson the naval official, undertook a\r\nMediterranean trading voyage, which occupied a year, the usual time\r\nallowed for the passage out and home. In the same way English merchants\r\ntraded with the Canaries and northern ports, but we have no details\r\nbearing on the extent of the traffic. William Hawkyns of Plymouth,\r\nfather of Sir John Hawkyns, made three voyages, of which the last was\r\nin 1532, to Brazil and Guinea. From a remark, however, made by Chapuys,\r\nin a despatch to the emperor, voyages to Brazil could not have been\r\nuncommon.[407]\r\n\r\nIn 1517 there is said to have been an exploring expedition sent out under\r\nthe command of Thomas Spert, who had been master of the _Henry Grace à\r\nDieu_ and other ships, and who possessed Henry’s confidence then and\r\nafterwards.[408] He was a yeoman of the crown, and by Letters Patent\r\nof 10th November 1514, enjoyed an annuity of £20 a year. In 1527 John\r\nRut, another man-of-war officer, left England in June with two vessels\r\nfor Newfoundland, one, the _Mary Guildford_, being a king’s ship. Rut\r\nreturned in her without having effected anything; the other was lost at\r\nsea. Two other attempts at discovery are also assigned to this year.[409]\r\nIn 1536 Hore, with the _Trinity_ and the _Minion_, reached Cape Breton\r\nIsland, and a further voyage was intended in 1541. These enterprises show\r\nHenry’s desire to extend English commerce, and a further illustration of\r\nthe fact is to be found in his endeavour in 1541 to obtain permission\r\nfor some Englishmen to sail in the next Portuguese fleet for India, ‘to\r\nadventure there for providing this realm with spices.’[410]\r\n\r\nDoubtless the religious revolt had for the time an injurious influence\r\non our trade, seeing that Englishmen were regarded as heretics by some\r\nof their best customers, and that the whole influence of the Roman\r\nChurch was employed in Spain, and elsewhere, to the detriment of the\r\ncountry. The reaction born of intellectual freedom, and of the moral and\r\nmaterial strength which was its natural product, did not make itself\r\nfelt till later. Moreover as long as England acknowledged the Roman rule\r\nshe was bound by the division of the new discoveries made by the Popes,\r\na division which fatally hampered her attempts to share the riches of\r\nthe golden West. When that dividing line was no longer recognised,\r\nand individual enterprise or greed had free play, the conditions which\r\nbrought her into antagonism with other maritime powers were also those\r\nwhich stimulated the growth of national vigour and self reliance. In that\r\nsense the Reformation considered as a liberation from restraining ties,\r\nwas an important factor in the development of English sea power.\r\n\r\nThere were two statutes, in 1532 and 1539, confirming the navigation act\r\nof 1490. In 1540 it was enacted that whoever should buy fish at sea from\r\nforeign fishermen to sell on shore, should be subjected to a fine of £10,\r\na statute which seems to point to the commencing decay of the native\r\nfishing industry. The cable and hawser manufacture, long associated with\r\nBridport, was protected by the parliament of 1529, and Henry is said\r\nto have expended immense sums in the endeavour to make Dover a safe\r\nharbour.[411] Another act for the preservation of Plymouth, Dartmouth,\r\nTeignmouth, Falmouth, and Fowey havens, from the injury caused by the\r\ngravel brought down from the tin works, was passed in 1532. In 1513 a\r\nlicense for the formation of a guild, afterwards the Trinity Corporation,\r\nwas granted for the ‘reformation of the navy lately much decayed by the\r\nadmission of young men without experience, and of Scots, Flemings, and\r\nFrenchmen as lodesmen;‘[412] in 1536 the Trinity guild of Newcastle was\r\nfounded.[413] ‘Navy’ is here used in its original sense, meaning the\r\nshipping and seamen of the kingdom generally, and not the ‘King’s Navy\r\nRoyal.’ During the sixteenth century the Trinity House had no connection\r\nwith the Royal Navy; during the greater part of the seventeenth century,\r\nit had an occasional consultative, but no direct connection. It has never\r\nhad any actual share in the administration of the Navy, nor that close\r\nassociation with it that, trading on the loss and destruction of its\r\nearly documents, it has claimed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Coast Defences.]\r\n\r\nAllied to the defence of the kingdom by sea was the protection of the\r\nseaboard by the forts or castles, on the south and east coasts, some\r\nof which still exist. The initial motive was the threatening political\r\noutlook of 1539 when a European coalition against England appeared\r\nprobable. During the next few years upwards of £74,000, from the spoil of\r\nthe suppression, was spent for this purpose,[414] and this perhaps does\r\nnot include £17,498 devoted to the fortifications of Hull. ‘A book of\r\npayments,’ made to the garrisons in 1540, enumerates seventeen of these\r\ndefences, but more were afterwards built.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Naval Expenditure.]\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, no chronological series of papers relating to\r\nthe naval expenditure of the reign. Only isolated accounts for those\r\nyears when active service was undertaken are to be found. The general\r\ndisbursements for 1513 came to £699,000,[415] and the naval expenses,\r\nfrom 4th March to 31st October, were £23,000, but this seems to have been\r\nalmost entirely for wages and hire of ships, only £291, 17s 9½d having\r\nbeen spent on repairs, and neither victualling, ordnance stores, nor the\r\ncost of preparation being included.[416] Detailed accounts were strictly\r\nkept although so few have survived. In one book it is stated that two\r\ncopies of the accounts were to be made; one to be retained by the person\r\ncharged with making payments, the other to be kept ‘in oure owne custodie\r\nfor oure more perfytte rememberaunce in that behalf.’[417] The first kept\r\nas his acquittance by Sir John Daunce, is now in the Record Office, and\r\nbears Henry’s signature in numerous places, showing the close personal\r\nattention he gave to naval affairs. When William Gonson was acting as\r\npaymaster, he received between 21st August 1532 and 25th August 1533,\r\n£4169, 10s, from 16th December 1534 to 11th December 1535 £7093, 17s\r\n9½d, and from 4th April 1536 to 29th June 1537, £3497, 3s 2d.[418] As a\r\nwhole, on these years, the crown was indebted, beyond the money paid out\r\nto Gonson, £1487, 12s 9d, and the expenditure was almost entirely for\r\ndockyard work and stores, although there must also have been the cost of\r\nships in commission, not here entered.\r\n\r\nDuring the years of warfare between 1544-7 the amounts expended became\r\nvery large. Richard Knight, who describes himself as ‘servant’ of Lord St\r\nJohn, received between 12th February 1544-5 and 30th June 1547, £101,127,\r\nand of this £84,000 was devoted to seamen’s wages and victualling.[419]\r\nOf the total sum £40,000 came from the Exchequer, £20,500 from the\r\nCourt of Augmentation, £1600 benevolence money in Norfolk, and £8000\r\nfrom the court of Wards and Liveries. Coincidently many thousands of\r\npounds were paid through William Gonson, John Wynter, and his successor,\r\nRobert Legge, and doubtless through other persons. The new system of\r\nadministration did not at first work altogether successfully as far as\r\nbookkeeping was concerned. From the following letter of Lisle’s we find\r\nthat Sir William Paget, a Secretary of State, had written to him making\r\ninquiries, and he answers\r\n\r\n    ‘You write unto me that the Tresawrer of thadmyralltie being\r\n    called to accompt his reckoning is so illfavoridly mad that\r\n    there semith a want of £2000 wich you cannot well se what is\r\n    become of hit.’\r\n\r\nand goes on to explain a series of transactions, but both Legge and\r\nWynter appear to have been performing the duties of Treasurer which may\r\nbe a reason for the entanglement of figures.[420] It was stated that\r\nduring 1544-5, the crown had expended £1,300,000,[421] and the naval\r\nexpenses from September 1542 to the end of the reign are fully detailed\r\nin a later paper.[422]\r\n\r\n  Cordage, timber, and other stores,                        £45,230 18  8\r\n  Coat and conduct money,                                     2,415 13  2\r\n  Wages of seamen, soldiers, shipwrights, dockyards, etc.,  127,846 10  7\r\n  Victualling,                                               65,610 10  4½\r\n  Ordnance and ammunition,                                   19,276 13 10½\r\n  Furniture[423] of ships,                                     1582 14  7\r\n  Hire of docks, storehouses, riding and posting charges,       502  4  6\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Piracy and Privateering.]\r\n\r\nGreat stress has been laid on the prevalence of piracy in the sixteenth\r\ncentury as the chief school of English seamanship. Of course it was\r\npractised during this reign to an extent that would now be thought\r\nmonstrous, but it did not attain the proportions of a few years later,\r\nnor were English seamen dependent on its development for a knowledge\r\nof their art. When religious and political motives impelled them to a\r\nguerilla warfare, they became pirates because they were already good\r\nseamen, with the training of centuries behind them, and the sea was their\r\nnatural field of action. The succession of conflicts between France and\r\nthe Empire induced an internecine maritime war between those powers, in\r\nthe shape of privateering, which sometimes smouldered but never died\r\nout. Convoys for the Spanish American fleets were instituted in 1522 on\r\naccount of the depredations of French privateers. The despatches of the\r\nImperial ministers show that France, during the reign of Henry and his\r\nimmediate successors, was, much more than England, a source of injury\r\nto Spanish trade. The success of French privateering, together with the\r\nvoyages for purposes of discovery and settlement, of Verazzani in 1523,\r\nof the brothers Parmentier in 1529, of Jacques Cartier and Roberval in\r\n1534 and 1549, of Villegagnon 1555, of Bois-le-Compte in 1556, of Jean\r\nde Ribaut in 1562, and of René de Laudonnière in 1564, a succession of\r\nefforts which only closed with the outbreak of the wars of religion,\r\nseemed to point to France rather than to England as destined to challenge\r\nSpanish maritime supremacy. In 1551 France sent a fleet of 160 sail to\r\nScotland, and it is doubtful whether England could have collected one of\r\nequal strength to act at a similar distance.\r\n\r\nEnglishmen, however, joined in the game to a sufficient extent even\r\nnow. In 1540 the Emperor was informed that a Spaniard, with gold and\r\namber on board, had been seized by two English ships, and a few such\r\nsuccessful and profitable incidents must have acted as a strong incentive\r\nto ventures which promised large profits on a moderate outlay. There was\r\nvery little police of the seas, nor could the guardians themselves be\r\ntrusted in face of temptation. In 1532 some captains sent out on this\r\nservice plundered Flemish merchantmen they met.[424] As early as 1515 a\r\ncommission of Oyer and Terminer was issued to the Earl of Surrey and two\r\nothers to hear and decide piratical offences[425]; in one case eighteen\r\nsoldiers serving on a man-of-war stole a boat with the intention of\r\nseizing a ship at sea. The French had, during the first quarter of the\r\ncentury, a reputation for fair play, and Wolsey in 1526, wrote to Henry\r\nthat ‘though many English have been taken at sea by the French, they\r\nhave always made full restitution,’[426] but when the Scotch began to\r\ninterfere in the trade, proceedings became embittered by competition. By\r\n1532 the narrow seas were said to be full of Scotch privateers and the\r\ncustomary ransom of prisoners was twenty shillings for a sailor and forty\r\nfor a master.[427] Both Spaniards and Frenchmen attacked each other in\r\nEnglish ports, which, until 1539, were mostly unarmed and plunder was\r\nopenly sold in the coast towns. That from a Portuguese ship was purchased\r\nby the mayor and others of Cork, and in 1537 the owners had been for\r\nthree years vainly endeavouring to obtain redress.[428]\r\n\r\nOrdinary merchantmen, sailing with cargo, took advantage of any\r\nfavourable chance without necessarily acting on a premeditated plan. One\r\nvessel, crossing the Channel, met three Bretons and it then occurred to\r\nthe owner and master that they had lost £60 by Breton pirates and could\r\nobtain no redress. Not to lose the opportunity they captured one and sold\r\nthe cargo at Penryn.[429] Piracy had not yet taken the savage character\r\nwith which a few more years were to see it imbued; the theological\r\nbitterness was as yet wanting. Cases of bloodshed were very rare, and\r\nso far at any rate as Englishmen were concerned, the pirate was also\r\nsometimes a respectable tradesman on shore.[430] In 1543 the prisons were\r\nsaid to be full of pirates and the Council adopted the plan of requiring\r\nsureties before issuing letters of marque. The port towns flourished,\r\nat least some of them, then and long afterwards far more on the traffic\r\nwith pirates, who visited them and sold the proceeds of robbery to the\r\ninhabitants, than by legitimate trade. Consequently no victim could rely\r\non obtaining assistance even from the civic authorities. A French ship\r\nwas ransacked in Plymouth Roads in August 1546—peace with France had\r\nbeen signed on 7th June—notwithstanding her captain’s appeal for help\r\nin the town, which seems to imply that the work was very leisurely and\r\nthoroughly done. The Council ordered that unless the goods were recovered\r\nand the pirates captured the inhabitants of Plymouth were to be made\r\npecuniarily liable for the damage.[431] The wording of the Council order\r\nsuggests that the Frenchman was boarded from the town, in which case the\r\nrefusal of the mayor to interfere is still more significant.\r\n\r\nOnly one statute relating to piracy was passed by Henry. Before 1535\r\noffenders frequently escaped because, if they did not confess, it was\r\nnecessary to prove the crime by the evidence of disinterested witnesses\r\nand this was usually an impossibility. A fresh act therefore rendered\r\nthem liable to be tried before a jury under the same conditions as\r\nordinary criminals.[432]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ordnance, Powder and Shot.]\r\n\r\nSoon after Henry’s accession he gave large orders for ordnance to foreign\r\nmakers, chiefly at Mechlin, but the guns so obtained seem to have been\r\nfor land service. There is only one paper which gives us the weight of\r\nthe ship serpentine as used in 1513, and here it works out at 261¼ lbs.\r\nexclusive of the chamber or loading piece which weighed 41 lbs.;[433]\r\nthe chamber contained the powder only, not the shot.[434] These were\r\nmade by Cornelius Johnson ‘the king’s iron gunmaker,’ and who was one of\r\nthe twelve gunners attached to the Tower with a fee of sixpence a day;\r\nas king’s gunmaker he also received eightpence a day. The sling, one\r\nof the heavier ship guns, weighed with its two chambers 8½ cwt. and 27\r\nlbs., and there were also half and quarter slings; but there does not\r\nappear to have been any standard weight for these or other guns.[435] The\r\nserpentines bought in Flanders, for field use, weighed from 1060 lbs. to\r\n1160 lbs. each. Guns were mounted on two or four-wheeled carriages, or,\r\nsometimes, on ‘scaffolds’ of timber; leaden shot and ‘dyse’ of iron were\r\nused with serpentines and iron shot with curtalls. In one instance 200\r\niron dice weighed 36 lbs., and they seem to have usually been one and a\r\nhalf inch square. The Artillery Garden at Houndsditch was granted for\r\npractice with ‘great and small ordinance,’ and persons with such English\r\nnames as Herbert, Walker, and Tyler are noticed as gunfounders early in\r\nthe reign, although, according to Stow, cast iron guns were not made in\r\nEngland till 1543. Some writers assert that they were used in Spain in\r\nthe fourteenth century; if so it is probable that they were made here\r\nbefore the date given by Stow.\r\n\r\nSerpentine powder cost from £4, 13s 4d to £6, 13s 4d and ‘bombdyne’\r\n£5 a last; corn powder tenpence a pound.[436] Serpentine was a fine\r\nweak powder and probably midway in strength between bombdyne and corn.\r\nDuring 1512-13, 51 lasts, 12 barrels, 12 lbs. were used at sea, and 37\r\nlasts during the succeeding year. For saltpetre we were dependent on\r\nimportation, and between 1509-12 there are two contracts for quantities\r\ncosting £3622, at sixpence a pound, with John Cavalcanti and other\r\nItalian merchants who were the usual purveyors, but gunpowder was made\r\nat home. Shot, whether of stone or iron, were called gunstones, round\r\nshot of iron costing £4, 10s to £5, 10s a ton, and of stone 13s 4d a\r\nhundred. Cross bar shot were in common use, _e.g._ ‘gun stones of iron\r\nwith cross bars of iron in them.’[437] There are ‘ballez of wyldfyre with\r\nhoks of yron,’ and ‘bolts of wyldfyre’ both, like the arrows of wildfire,\r\nto set the enemy on fire. ‘Tampons’ were wads, sometimes of wood, and\r\nnot the tompions now known: 16,000 were bought for the _Henry Grace à\r\nDieu_ at ten and twenty shillings the thousand.[438] From an entry ‘for\r\ntwo sheepskins to stop the mouths of the guns,’ we may infer that they\r\nwere stuffed into the muzzles, or tied over them. Sheepskins were also\r\nused for gun sponges, and ‘cartouche’ or cartridge cases were made of\r\ncanvas.[439]\r\n\r\nIn 1536 there were only 39 lasts, 11 barrels of powder in the Tower,\r\n33,000 livery arrows,[440] ‘decayed,’ all the bows in the same condition,\r\nand the morrispikes wormeaten.[441] But the construction of the forts\r\nround the coastline in 1539-40, and the events that followed, gave an\r\nimpetus to the demand for war material.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stores.]\r\n\r\nIn 1546 the Council querulously complained that ‘the general rule is\r\nwhenever the King’s Maiestie shuld bye al is dere and skase, and whenever\r\nhe shuld sel al is plentye and good chepe,’ an experience not confined\r\nto sovereigns. Stores such as timber, pitch, tar, oakum, ironwork, etc.,\r\nnecessary for building or repairs were mostly obtained from tradesmen at\r\nor near the dockyard towns. One reason for the adoption of Portsmouth is\r\nperhaps to be found in its nearness to Bere Forest and the New Forest,\r\nbut nearly everything but timber, if not to be obtained at Southampton,\r\nhad to be sent from London. Naval officials, like Gonson, sold\r\nnecessaries to the crown, while acting as its representatives, and such\r\ntransactions appear in the accounts as quite legitimate and customary.\r\nAbout 1522 oak timber from Bere was costing one shilling a ton rough\r\nand unhewed, one and eightpence seasoned, and three and fourpence ready\r\nsquared. Ash was one shilling and beech sixpence.[442] Carriage cost\r\ntwopence a ton per mile, and the work of felling and preparing the wood\r\nwas performed by the king’s shipwrights who were sent into the forests\r\nfor that purpose. Iron was £4 to £5, 10s a ton, the Spanish being of a\r\nbetter quality than the English and costing the higher price. Cables\r\nwere used up to seventeen inches in circumference, ordinarily described\r\nas Dantzic, but sometimes from Lynn and Bridport, and bought of both\r\nEnglish and foreign merchants. The price averaged about £12 a ton. The\r\nestablishments did not, in 1515, possess any means of weighing cordage\r\ndelivered, and there is a charge of 3s 4d for scales ‘hyrede of a belle\r\nffundere dwellynge at Hondise Diche,’ and sent down to Deptford to\r\nweigh purchased cables. The following are the prices of miscellaneous\r\nrequisites:—\r\n\r\n         { Olron[443] (1515), 14s 4d and 15s a bolt[444]\r\n  Canvas {   do.

So far as the Navy is concerned\r\nthere is little but unqualified praise to be awarded to Henry. That his\r\naction was due to a settled policy and not the product of a momentary\r\nvanity or desire for display is shown by the fact that it commenced\r\nwith his accession and was still progressing at his decease. For almost\r\nthirty-eight years nearly every year marked some advance in construction\r\nor administration, some plan calculated to make the Navy a more effective\r\nfighting instrument. So far as numbers went he made it the most powerful\r\nnavy in the world, remembering the limited radius within which it was\r\ncalled upon to act. He revolutionised its armament and improved its\r\nfighting and sailing qualities, he himself inventing or adapting a type\r\nthought fit for the narrow seas. He enlarged the one dockyard he found\r\nexisting and formed two others in positions so suitable for their purpose\r\nthat they remained in use as long as the system of wooden ships they\r\nwere built in connection with. Regulations for the manœuvring of fleets\r\nand the discipline of their crews were due to him. He discarded the one\r\nmediæval officer of the crown and organised an administration so broadly\r\nplanned that, in an extended form, it remains in existence to-day. He\r\nbuilt forts for the defence of the coasts, a measure that might now be\r\ncriticised as showing ignorance of the strategical use of a fleet, but a\r\ncriticism which is inapplicable to the middle of the sixteenth century\r\nwhen the Navy had yet to fight its way not only to supremacy but to\r\nequality. It may be said that events pointed to, and almost enforced,\r\nthe new direction given to national endeavour and the new value attached\r\nto the naval arm. Allowing due weight to the altered conditions the fact\r\nremains that Henry accepted them and carried out the innovations they\r\ninvolved with an energy and thoroughness akin to genius. The maritime\r\nsystems of France and Spain, whether in details of shipbuilding or the\r\nlarger methods of administration, remained unchanging and inelastic,\r\nignoring the mutations of a century remarkable for activity and progress.\r\nSpain tried to hold the command of the sea in the sixteenth century with\r\nan organisation little altered from that found sufficient in the previous\r\none. Circumstances brought England into conflict with her and not with\r\nFrance, and she had to pay for her blunder of pride or sluggishness with\r\nthe ruin of her empire.\r\n\r\nIn these changes history gives no sign of there being any extraneous\r\ninfluence acting through the king. Ministers might come and go but\r\nthe work of naval extension, done under his personal supervision and\r\ndirection, went on methodically and unceasingly. He trod a path that\r\nsome of his predecessors had indicated but none had entered. The errors\r\nhe committed were those inevitable to a new scheme, a plan which was not\r\nan enlargement but a reconstruction, and in which he was a pioneer. His\r\nmistakes were those of the scientific ignorance and feudal spirit of his\r\nage; his successes were of a much higher order and informed with the\r\nstatesmanship of a later time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD VI\r\n\r\n1547-1553\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Changes in the Navy List.]\r\n\r\nIt is usually said that during the reigns of Edward VI and Mary the\r\nNavy was neglected. As a generalisation this is incorrect, although\r\nit is true that the number of ships fell off and that the results of\r\nnaval undertakings were not commensurate with the efforts made, or\r\nthe money expended upon them. But the administration of both reigns\r\nwill compare favourably with that of long periods of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. Considering the tardy acceptance of new ideas it would have been\r\nmarvellous had Henry’s policy been at once consistently and continuously\r\ncarried on. The factious struggles which occupied the reign of Edward\r\nand the religious difficulties of that of Mary were not conducive to\r\nperseverance in any settled design, but at least the Regency did not make\r\nit their business to at once sell off the Navy. Moreover many of the\r\ndisappearances from the Edwardian navy lists are of the purchased vessels\r\nof the later years of Henry’s reign, and of the small rowbarges he had\r\nbuilt from his own design and for a special purpose. The former, we may\r\nbe certain, had not been constructed with the strength and solidity\r\ncharacterising English ships, and some were perhaps old when bought into\r\nthe service for which they were momentarily desirable.\r\n\r\nThe earliest navy list subsequent to Henry’s death is of 5th Jan.\r\n1548.[448] This contains 32 large vessels, having an aggregate of 10,600\r\ntons, besides the _Galley Subtylle_, 13 rowbarges of 20 tons each, and 4\r\nbarks of 40 tons. Of other ships belonging to the last reign the _French\r\nGalley_ or _Mermaid_ is omitted, but was in the service then and long\r\nafterwards, the _Artigo_ had been sold by an order of 14th April 1547,\r\nand the _Minion_ had been given to Sir Thomas Seymour. Comparing this\r\nwith the next list of 22nd May 1549[449] we find that not only are all\r\nthe large vessels of 1548 still carried in it but that it is increased\r\nby the presence of the _Mary Willoby_, recaptured in 1547, two French\r\nprizes of 200 tons each, and ‘the three new pinnaces unnamed,’ and\r\nevidently just built.[450] Eleven ships were cruising in the North Sea\r\nand eighteen in the Channel, which does not give the impression of a\r\ncessation of activity notwithstanding the intrigues of Somerset, Seymour,\r\nand Northumberland, Kett’s rising, and similar distractions. During 1548\r\nand 1549 ten of the rowbarges, being doubtless found useless, were sold\r\nfor £165, 4s.[451] The next list is of 26th August 1552[452]; of the\r\nbefore-named 32 vessels the _Murryan_ had been sold in December 1551\r\nfor £400, the _Struse_ for £200, the _Christopher_ and _Unicorn_ are\r\nordered to be sold, the _Grand Mistress_ is considered worthless, and\r\nthe _Less Bark_, _Lion_, and _Dragon_ are to be rebuilt. The remainder\r\nare still serviceable, or require only slight repair, while the names\r\nof the _Primrose_ and _Bark of Bullen_ reappear attached to new ships\r\nand the _Mary Willoby_ has been rebuilt.[453] A French prize, the _Black\r\nGalley_, captured in 1549, is not found in this list, and the _Lion_,\r\na Scotch man-of-war taken by the _Pauncye_, was lost off Harwich. In\r\nJanuary 1551 a fleet of twelve vessels was at sea, and in 1552 at least\r\neight vessels were in commission, so that altogether up to 1552 there was\r\nno great reduction in the effective strength or want of energy in its\r\nuse. There were now three galleys belonging to the crown and they were\r\nnot favourably regarded. In 1551 a note of the debts incurred in relation\r\nto them was required and the crews were to be discharged as the vessels\r\nwere very expensive and ‘serve indede to lytle purpose.’[454] This was\r\nfollowed by a warrant on 30th March for £231, 12s to pay them off, and\r\n£55 ‘to be divided equallie amonge the Forsares nowe disarmed.’\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gillingham.]\r\n\r\nEdward died on 6th July 1553, therefore it is not strange that there is\r\nno later navy list of his reign than that of August 1552. Not only was\r\nthere no deterioration during his short rule, but two important steps\r\nwere taken in furtherance of the work of organisation that was Henry’s\r\nlegacy. The commencement of the great Chatham yard, and the formation of\r\nthe Victualling into a separate and responsible department, were due to\r\nthe action of the Council. The Medway anchorage was then, and for some\r\nyears afterwards, called Gillingham, or Jillingham, Water, and the first\r\norder for its use is of 8th June 1550, when the Council directed that all\r\nthe ships laid up were to be, after the discharge of their officers and\r\ncrews, ‘herbarowed’ there.[455] On 14th August they further ordered that\r\nthe men-of-war at Portsmouth were to be brought round to Gillingham, and\r\non 22nd August William Wynter, then ‘Surveyor of the Ships,’ was sent\r\ndown to superintend their removal.[456] This of course could have been no\r\nsudden determination, but there is no hint of the discussions that must\r\nhave preceded it. Considerations that may have favoured the measure were\r\nthe limited anchorage space afforded by Woolwich and Deptford, and the\r\ndistance of Portsmouth from the centre of government and the merchants\r\nsupplying stores, of which nearly all had to be sent from London. Another\r\nreason was the ease with which the work of grounding and graving could\r\nbe carried on in the Medway with its banks of mud and large tidal rise\r\nand fall; this, in fact, is the only one given in the Council order of\r\n14th August 1550. Years were yet to elapse before the beginning of the\r\ndockyard appears, and the victualling storehouses for the men employed\r\nwere at Rochester. That there were a large number of men there is shown\r\nby the victualling accounts between 28th June 1550 and 29th September\r\n1552. Rochester stands for £6137 of the total, while Woolwich and\r\nDeptford cost £8382, Portsmouth £2407, and Dover £646.[457] The Admiralty\r\nbranch, represented by the Treasurer, spent, up to 24th October 1551\r\n£6600, at Gillingham in wages and necessaries. Portsmouth, however, only\r\nslowly lost its comparative pre-eminence although it was now far less\r\nimportant than Deptford; in 1556 there were still more vessels laid up\r\nthere than at Gillingham, and its victualling charges, the only test\r\nremaining, were £2472, against £1526 at Gillingham. The choice of the\r\nMedway was followed by an order, on 16th January 1551, to build a bulwark\r\nat Sheerness for its defence.[458]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Naval Expenditure.]\r\n\r\nThe only accounts of the Navy Treasurer which have survived for this\r\nreign are from 25th December 1546 to 25th December 1547, and from 29th\r\nSeptember 1548 to 24th October 1551.[459] During the first period his\r\nexpenses were nearly £41,000, of which sea-charges (wages) were £6926,\r\nDeptford £18,824, Woolwich £3439, Gillingham £4167, Harwich £1631,\r\nColne £484, and Portsmouth £1211. It will be noticed that there are\r\nheavy payments in relation to Gillingham nearly three years before the\r\naction of the Council, in 1550. There is no obvious explanation of\r\nthis; the body of the account does not show what particular work was\r\ncarried on there but it may have been done by way of experiment. In the\r\nsecond period the Treasurer received £65,809 and spent £66,250. Of this\r\nsum sea-charges were £14,400, press and conduct money £2900, Deptford\r\n£30,300, Woolwich £2054, Gillingham £6600, and Portsmouth £1157. Edward\r\nVI inherited his father’s interest in maritime affairs and appears to\r\nhave been continually at Deptford. There is a charge of £88, 6s 2d for\r\npaving ‘the street,’ presumably the High Street, which was ‘so noysome\r\nand full of fylth that the Kynges Maiestie myght not pass to and fro to\r\nse the buylding of his Highnes shippes.’[460] Deptford, it is seen, was\r\nnow the leading dockyard, a position it retained for the remainder of the\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nAll such improvements as seemed beneficial were adopted that the service\r\nmight be rendered more efficient. A warrant for £70, 11s was issued to\r\npay for ‘bringing over certain Bretons to teach men here the art of\r\nmaking polldavies.’ From another document we find that two of these\r\nBretons were attached to Deptford. Lead sheathing was newly applied to\r\nEnglish ships in 1553, but had been since 1514 in use in the Spanish\r\nmarine.[461]\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that Henry VIII had intended the formation\r\nof a Victualling Department, and that the Council only executed a set\r\npurpose already fully discussed and resolved upon. To a man with Henry’s\r\nclear perception of the needs of the growing Navy, and his liking for\r\nsystematic and responsible management, the haphazard method of a dozen\r\nagents acting independently and uncontrolled by any central authority,\r\nmust have been peculiarly hateful. Edward Baeshe who, until 1547, had\r\nbeen merely one of the many agents employed, was chosen in that year to\r\nact with Richard Wattes, the two being appointed ‘surveyors of victuals\r\nwithin the city of London,’ with power to press workmen, seamen, and\r\nships, and with a general superintendence over their local subordinates.\r\nThey supplied not only the fleet but the troops acting against Scotland.\r\nThis was a tentative movement onwards, but by Letters Patent of 28th June\r\n1550, Baeshe alone was appointed ‘General Surveyor of the Victuals for\r\nthe Seas,’ with a fee of £50 a year, three shillings and fourpence a day\r\nfor travelling expenses, and two shillings a day for clerks. Provisions\r\nwere obtained by exercising the crown prerogative of purveyance, and the\r\nmoney required was received from the Treasurer of the Navy and included\r\nin his estimates, although Baeshe also kept separate accounts which\r\nwere examined and signed by not less than two of the Admiralty officers.\r\nBetween 1st July 1547, and 29th September 1552, £51,500 passed through\r\nhis hands and his inferior officers were acting under his directions\r\nwheresoever ships were stationed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Admiralty Officers.]\r\n\r\nDeath and other accidents soon altered the arrangement of the Navy Board\r\nas appointed by Henry VIII. Robert Legge, the first Treasurer by patent,\r\ndied some time in 1548, and his accounts determined on 29th September. He\r\nwas succeeded by Benjamin Gonson, although Gonson’s Letters Patent bear\r\nthe date of 8th July 1549. William Wynter, son of John Wynter the first\r\nTreasurer, and who was making a name as a seaman, succeeded Gonson as\r\nSurveyor by Letters Patent of the same date. William Holstock, formerly\r\nan unclassified assistant, became keeper of the storehouses at Deptford\r\nby patent of 25th June 1549, at a salary of £26, 13s 4d a year and £6 for\r\nboat hire. Sir William Woodhouse, originally Master of the Ordnance of\r\nthe Navy, succeeded Sir Thomas Clere as Lieutenant of the Admiralty by a\r\npatent of 16th December 1552, and on the same day Thomas Windham replaced\r\nWoodhouse as Master of the Ordnance of the Navy. From the date of the\r\ninstitution of the Admiralty the post of Lord Admiral, hitherto one of\r\ndignity and occasional high command, became an office necessitating work\r\nof a more everyday character. Although there is no precise order bearing\r\non the subject it is evident that its holder was at the head of the Board\r\nand decided questions referred to him by the inferior officers. Thomas,\r\nLord Seymour of Sudeley, was appointed on 17th February 1547, and was\r\nbeheaded on 20th March 1549. John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, who, under his\r\nearlier title of Lord Lisle had held the post under Henry VIII was again\r\nnominated for a short time from 28th October 1549, but from 4th May 1550\r\nEdward, Lord Clynton, became High Admiral.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Piracy and Privateering.]\r\n\r\nStrangely as it may read, there was for the moment a direct connection\r\nbetween this great office of the crown and piracy, for Lord Seymour\r\nwas implicated in several nefarious transactions of the kind. But the\r\ngovernment itself, while publicly denouncing pirates and equipping ships\r\nto apprehend them, was secretly encouraging acts which were only to be\r\nfaintly distinguished from open robbery. In August 1548 certain vessels\r\nwere sent out against the Scots and pirates, but private instructions\r\nwere given to the captains that, because we were on very doubtful terms\r\nwith France, they were to seize French ships, ‘saying to them that they\r\nhave been spoyled before by frenchemenne and could have no justice, or\r\npretending that the victualles or thinges of munition found in any such\r\nfrenche shippes weare sent to ayde the Scottes or such lyk.’[462] It\r\nis true that if peace continued all such cargoes were to be restored\r\nand the captors’ expenses discharged by the government, but in face of\r\nsuch teaching it cannot be a matter for surprise that the generality of\r\nowners and captains bettered their instructions and failed to draw the\r\nline at the exact point marked for them. One of the articles against\r\nSeymour at his trial included accusations that goods taken by pirates\r\nwere seen in his house and distributed among his friends; that when\r\nplunder had been recaptured from the freebooters the captors were sent\r\nto prison, and that pirates taken and committed to prison were set\r\nfree. As a rule the charges made in an indictment of a fallen minister\r\nrequire to be very closely scanned, but for these there is a good deal\r\nof corroborative evidence. As early as 20th September 1546, the Council\r\nwere hearing the complaint of ‘oon that sueth against a servant of Sir\r\nThomas Semars for a pyracie.’ After his death the Council awarded £40 to\r\na Frenchman in compensation for losses sustained through ‘the ministres\r\nof Lord Seymour.’[463] There is a distinct statement that when pressed\r\nfor money after the death of his wife, the Dowager Queen, he was, among\r\nother things, in partnership with many pirates and received half the\r\nbooty.[464] Although some of the details of the complaints made against\r\nhim may be inexact there can be no doubt that the charges as a whole\r\nwere well founded, and it is significant that the Council dealt with the\r\ntrouble more successfully after his execution.\r\n\r\nIn view of the proceedings of the government and the Lord Admiral, it\r\nis not surprising that piracy advanced in popularity. Ships, either of\r\nthe Navy or hired, were being continually sent to sea to keep order;\r\nsometimes the latter joined in the business themselves[465] and the\r\nformer often gave but half-hearted service. As many of the company of a\r\nman-of-war might, a month before, have been members of a pirate’s crew,\r\nand perhaps expected at their discharge to again tread a rover’s deck,\r\nno great ardour was to be expected from them. At times they seem to have\r\nbeen unable even to wait for their discharge. When Tyrrel and Holstock\r\nwere serving in the Channel, their men, when they boarded foreigners\r\nfor inquiry, robbed them of property and provisions.[466] The superior\r\nofficers had to be spurred on to their duty. On one occasion it was\r\nnecessary to order the Admiral commanding in the Channel to attend to\r\nhis business, ‘and not lye in the haven at Dover idlye as the Navye\r\ndoth.’[467] When a leader of the fraternity was caught, the haul usually\r\nproved expensive and useless, as he was speedily free again; £300 was\r\ngranted to the captors of Cole, a well-known name about this time, but\r\nCole is soon found to be at work once more. Strangeways who later died\r\nin Elizabeth’s service at Havre, Thomson, and Thomas and Peter Killigrew\r\nwere others whose names were too familiar to the Council. English, Irish,\r\nand Scotch pirates swarmed in the narrow seas, a fleet of twenty sail\r\nwere on the Irish coast, and the Scotch seem to have been particularly\r\nactive.\r\n\r\nThese adventurers, whether licensed or unlicensed, were usually gallant\r\nenough and thought little about odds. A privateer of 95 tons and 28\r\nofficers and men fell in with a fleet of 27 Normans and Bretons returning\r\nfrom Scotland where they had served for six months. Nothing daunted,\r\n‘althugh our powr were litle yet as pore men desyrus to do our dewtye,’\r\nthey closed with one and drove it ashore where they left it ‘rolling\r\nuppon the terrabile waves,’ then drove two others ashore and captured a\r\nfourth. The French fleet carried 120 guns and 1100 men.[468] The incident\r\nis remarkable as showing the careless indifference, born of centuries of\r\nstruggle with the sea and the enemies it carried, with which our seamen\r\nregarded superior strength, long before the outburst of successful piracy\r\non a large scale, which is supposed to have taught them their peculiar\r\nfaculty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Salute to the Flag.]\r\n\r\nIn other ways the members of the Regency showed themselves desirous of\r\nupholding the honour of their country. There is no especial reference\r\nduring the previous reign to the claim to the salute, but it was now\r\nstringently enforced when possible. It was not yielded however without\r\nprotest, ‘the Fleming’s men-of-war would have passed our ships without\r\nvailing bonnet, which they seeing, shot at them and drove them at length\r\nto vail the bonet.’[469] A year later they were more tractable, since\r\nthe Flemings riding at Dieppe lowered the sail to an English man-of-war\r\nwhich came into the port.[470] With France the question was less easily\r\nsettled. When Henry Dudley and the Baron de la Garde were both at sea,\r\nthe former, having the weaker fleet, desired instructions about the\r\nsalute. The Council wrote that ‘in respect of thamitie and that the sayd\r\nBaron is stronger upon the sees sume tymes yelde and sume tymes receyve\r\nthonnour.’[471]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rewards and Peculations.]\r\n\r\nThere was no change in the pay or position of the seamen, but they appear\r\nto have been liberally treated. The crew of the _Minion_, 300 in number,\r\nwere given £100 among them for capturing a Frenchman, probably the\r\n_Black Galley_,[472] William Wynter, Surveyor of the Navy, commanded the\r\n_Minion_ on this occasion, and neither now nor afterwards did the duties\r\nof their posts prevent the four principal Officers commanding at sea,\r\nsometimes for long periods.\r\n\r\nWe do not find any mention of embezzlements and thefts during the reign\r\nof Henry VIII, not, probably, because they did not occur, but because the\r\nNavy papers are comparatively scanty and mostly financial accounts made\r\nup in their final form. With Edward VI they begin to appear, and grow\r\nrapidly in number subsequently. It was found necessary to pass an act\r\nforbidding the Lord Admiral, or any of his officers, to exact payments\r\nof money or fish from the Newfoundland or Iceland fishermen under pain\r\nof a fine of treble the amount levied.[473] It was said to be a practice\r\nof ‘within these few years now last past,’ but abuses usually have to be\r\nof long existence before they attain the honour of an Act of Parliament\r\nfor their suppression. A victualling agent, Henry Folk, was committed\r\nto the Fleet prison for embezzling money received for navy victualling,\r\n‘which he hath not answered againe to the poore men but converted the\r\nmoney otherways and suffered them to remayne unpayed and in exclamacion,’\r\nThe ‘poore men’ here referred to are more likely to have been persons\r\nfrom whom provisions had been purchased than seamen. The decline of the\r\nfishing industry was attributed, among other causes, to the action of the\r\ncrown purveyors in seizing quantities of fish at nominal prices.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Merchant Shipping and Trade.]\r\n\r\nThere is no return of merchant shipping for this period, but the bounty\r\nof five shillings a ton on new vessels was paid in several cases. Lord\r\nRussell, the Lord Privy Seal, received it on the _Anne Russell_ of 110\r\ntons and there are other similar warrants. There is, however, a paper\r\ncalendared under the next reign which gives a list of merchantmen of 100\r\ntons and upwards, ‘decayed’ between 1544-5 and 1553. It names seventeen\r\nbelonging to London of 2530 tons, thirteen of Bristol of 2380 tons, and\r\nfive owned in other ports.[474] This does not necessarily mean that the\r\nmerchant navy had decreased to the extent of thirty-five such ships but\r\nmay refer to those worn out by age and service and possibly replaced.\r\nRoyal ships were still chartered by merchants for trading purposes; £1000\r\nwas paid for the _Jesus of Lubeck_ and another, for a voyage to the\r\nLevant in 1552.[475] Later in the reign two of the navy officers, Gonson\r\nand Wynter, were indulging in similar speculation, and obtained the\r\n_Mathew_ valued at £1208, for which they were required to give sureties.\r\n\r\nA commercial treaty with Sweden was on foot in 1550, but as the King of\r\nDenmark was urgently complaining of the English pirates who infested the\r\nSound it was not likely to be of much advantage. The formation of the\r\nRussia company in 1553, although it was not incorporated until 1555,\r\nmarked the inception of the great trading companies which did much,\r\ndirectly and indirectly, to increase both the number of ships and their\r\nsize. Attention was given to the fishing trade and its growth stimulated\r\nby an enactment[476] which made Fridays, Saturdays, and Ember days, fish\r\ndays, under penalty of ten shillings fine, and ten days’ imprisonment for\r\nthe first, and double for the second and every following offence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The circumstances under which the Navy was maintained.]\r\n\r\nAll through the reign regard was paid to naval requirements under\r\nfinancial conditions which, during many other periods, would have ensured\r\ntheir relegation to a future time. On the 4th November 1550, the Officers\r\nof the Navy appeared before the Council and brought books with them, one\r\nrelating to the docking and repair of certain ships, a second ‘concerning\r\nthings necessary to be done,’ and a third containing an estimate of\r\nstores required. The money wanted for these purposes was £2436, and the\r\ndepartment was already in debt to the amount of £4800. Two years later\r\nthe crown owed £132,372 abroad and £108,826 at home, of which only £5000\r\nwas due by the Admiralty.[477] The naval expenses from January 1547 to\r\nSeptember 1552 are tabulated as:—[478]\r\n\r\n  Cordage, timber, etc.,                                    £51,152 11  5\r\n  Coat and conduct money,                                      5070  1  5\r\n  Wages of soldiers, sailors, dockyards, shipwrights, etc.,  78,263  3  8½\r\n  Furniture of ships and carriage,                             2451 14 10\r\n  Riding and posting charges, hire of docks and storehouses,   1609  4  6\r\n  Victualling,                                               64,844 17  3½\r\n  Ordnance and ammunition,                                   10,445 16  8½\r\n\r\nThese were very large amounts, taken with those of the last years of\r\nHenry VIII,[479] for the England of 1552, and we know that the public\r\ndebt of £241,000 was the result of heavy borrowings at home and abroad.\r\nSome progress however was made towards the liquidation of the debt,\r\nsince it had sunk to £180,000 at the accession of Mary. But as, in this\r\nfinancial situation, the Navy was not allowed to materially retrogress\r\nthe imputation usually made against the Regency of indifference to its\r\nstrength is one certainly not justified by facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARY AND PHILIP AND MARY\r\n\r\n1553-1558\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Royal Ships.]\r\n\r\nThere is no complete navy list for the reign of Mary therefore the\r\nchanges that took place in the royal ships can only, in most cases,\r\nbe ascertained by comparison with earlier and later lists. There is,\r\nhowever, a record of the sale of certain ships in 1555; the _Primrose_\r\nfor £1000, the _Mary Hambro_ £20, the _Grand Mistress_ £35, the _Hind_\r\n£8, the _Christopher_ £15, the _Unicorn_ £10, and four of the smallest\r\npinnaces or rowbarges.[480] The prices obtained show that, with the\r\nexception of the _Primrose_, they must have been in very bad condition.\r\nThe _Bark of Bullen_ was delivered in 1553 to Jeffrey Coke, on condition\r\nof his carrying the Lord Deputy and the royal despatches to and from\r\nIreland when necessary.[481] The _Henry Grace à Dieu_ was burnt by\r\naccident at Woolwich on 25th August 1553.[482] Comparing the first\r\ncomplete navy list of Elizabeth with the Edwardian of 26th August 1552,\r\nwe find that, besides the above mentioned vessels, only the _Pauncye_,\r\n_Mathew_, and _Less Bark_, are wanting of the larger ships. On the other\r\nhand the _Sacrett_, a French prize of 160 tons, a new _Mary Rose_ of\r\n500 tons in 1555, the _Philip and Mary_ in 1556 of 450 tons, the _Lion_\r\nrebuilt in 1557, a new _Bark of Boulogne_, and the _Brigantine_ replace\r\nthese deficiencies. When we read that Henry VIII left a fleet of 53\r\nvessels, and that it rapidly diminished after his death, it must be\r\nremembered that thirteen of them were twenty-ton rowbarges immediately\r\ncast off as useless, and that only twenty-eight, excluding the galleys,\r\nwere of 100 tons and upwards. A navy list of February 1559 names\r\ntwenty-five of this class, serviceable and unserviceable, and the next,\r\nof 24th March 1559, twenty. Accepting the last, as affording the most\r\nunfavourable comparison, it does not warrant the severe condemnation of\r\nthe naval administration of Mary’s reign to which we are accustomed.\r\nMoreover many of the men-of-war dated from the years 1544-6, and were\r\nnow approaching the time when they required rebuilding. The long ‘life’\r\nof wooden as compared with iron ships has become proverbial but did not\r\napply to sixteenth, and hardly to seventeenth century vessels. Doubtless\r\nthe absence of proper sheathing, and the bad adjustment of weights, which\r\ncaused excessive straining in a seaway, had much to do with it, but\r\nwhatever the cause men-of-war are found to need rebuilding within, at the\r\nmost, every twenty-five years during the Tudor and Stewart reigns.\r\n\r\nThere is an Elizabethan paper of 1562[483] which, if it can be even\r\npartially trusted, shows that the closing months of Mary’s reign were\r\ncharacterised by great dockyard activity. The _Hart_, _Antelope_,\r\n_Swallow_, _New Bark_, _Jennett_, _Greyhound_, _Phœnix_, and _Sacar_ are\r\nassigned to 1558 as new ships, that is to say as rebuilt, for in these\r\nearly documents distinction is seldom drawn between one really new and\r\none merely rebuilt. Mary died on 17th November 1558, and if the year were\r\nreckoned by the New Style there would be no question but that they must\r\nhave been begun during her lifetime and finished at least shortly after\r\nher death. But at this time the year ended on 24th March, and the unknown\r\nwriter of the paper in the _Cecil MSS._ when he assigns these vessels\r\nto 1558 means a period ceasing on 24th March 1559, when Elizabeth had\r\nbeen nearly four-and-a-half months on the throne. It is known that the\r\ndockyards were working busily shortly after Elizabeth’s accession, but\r\nassuming the 1562 writer to be correct in his dates, and as a whole there\r\nis some corroborative evidence of his general accuracy, it seems quite\r\nimpossible that these eight ships could have been rebuilt between 17th\r\nNovember 1558, and 24th March 1559. That being so Mary’s government must\r\nbe allowed the credit of recognising the decline in the effective force\r\nand of the measures taken for its renewal.\r\n\r\nThere is another test that can be applied to the question of the activity\r\nor inactivity of the government, and that is the number of ships sent to\r\nsea during these years. In 1554 twenty-nine men-of-war, manned by 4034\r\nmen, were in commission;[484] during 1555-6 thirty-eight, several of\r\nthem of course twice or thrice over;[485] in 1557 twenty-four, and in\r\nDecember eight others were in preparation.[486] Yet, again, if we take\r\nthe squadrons especially sent out pirate catching, we find that during\r\n1555-6 eight vessels were equipped to search for Cole and Stevenson, two\r\nwell known adventurers, and there are many other references to men-of-war\r\ncommissioned with the same object. In another way the naval history of\r\nthis reign is noteworthy. Although it was not unknown for ships to be at\r\nsea in winter it was as yet exceptional, but we now find it occurring\r\nmore frequently during these few years than through the whole reign of\r\nHenry VIII. No fewer than eight were cruising during the first four\r\nmonths of 1556;[487] in October 1557, ten;[488] and ten in February and\r\nMarch of the same year.[489]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Admiralty Officers and Administration.]\r\n\r\nLord Clynton was still Lord Admiral at the death of Edward VI. He was\r\nthen unfortunate enough to be on the wrong side, and his influence with\r\nthe men seems to have been small, as the crews of six vessels, sent\r\nto the Norfolk coast to prevent the flight of Mary, went over to her\r\nside. Clynton was replaced by William, Lord Howard of Effingham, from\r\n26th March 1554. The first named, however, regained the Queen’s favour\r\nby the efficient aid he gave in Wyatt’s rising and was reappointed on\r\n10th February 1557; thenceforward he retained the office till his death\r\non 16th January 1585. The only other change among the chief officers\r\nwas the nomination of William Wynter to be Master of the Ordnance of\r\nthe Navy from 2nd November 1557;[490] he was already Surveyor and now\r\nheld both offices for the rest of his life. The salary of the conjoined\r\nappointments was £100 a year, with the usual 6s 8d a day travelling\r\nexpenses, 2s 4d a day for clerks, and £8 a year for boat hire. The\r\nmanagement of the Admiralty was, if not exactly reformed, subjected to\r\nclose scrutiny. In 1556 Lord Howard was ordered ‘to repayre himself\r\nforthwith on receipte hereof,’ without the knowledge of the other\r\nofficers, and take ‘a secret muster’ of the men on board the ships, to\r\nsearch the ships for concealed men and victuals, and to arrange for a\r\nmonthly muster on the cruisers in the narrow seas.[491] Regulations\r\nwere also established for the supply of stores and provisions and their\r\neconomical use, and a first attempt was made to check the waste of\r\nammunition in saluting by an order that it was not to be consumed in\r\n‘vayne shot.’[492]\r\n\r\nA year later a further alteration followed, which took the form of\r\nallowing a fixed yearly sum for ordinary naval expenses, a rule which\r\nremained long in force. There may also have been other reasons for some\r\nadditional changes made. Clynton may not have been entirely trusted, or\r\nsome suspicion, perhaps, was taking shape concerning the provident or\r\nhonest conduct of the Officers. The order ran:—\r\n\r\n    ‘Wheare heretofore the Quenes Maiestie hath ben sundrie tymes\r\n    troubled with thoften signing of warrantes for money to be\r\n    defraied about the necessarie chardges of her Highnesses navie\r\n    and being desierouse to have some other order taken for the\r\n    easyer conducting of this matter heareaftyr: Dyd this daie upon\r\n    consultacion had with certayn of my lords of the Counsell for\r\n    this purpose desyere the Lord Treasurer[493] with thadvise of\r\n    the Lord Admyrall to take this matter upon hym who agreinge\r\n    thareunto was content to take the chardge thereof with theis\r\n    conditions ffollowinge; ffirst, he requyred to have the some of\r\n    £14,000 by yere to be advaunced half yerely to Benjamyn Gonson\r\n    Threasarer of Thadmyraltie to be by hym defrayed in such sort\r\n    as shalbe prescribed by hym the sayed Lord Threasowrer with\r\n    thadvise of the Lorde Admyrall.’\r\n\r\nFor which sum the Lord Treasurer will\r\n\r\n    ‘cause such of her Maiesties shippes as may be made servicable\r\n    with calkeinge and newe trymmynge to be sufficiently renewed\r\n    and repaired Item to cause such of her Highnes saied shippes as\r\n    must of necessitie be made of newe to be gone in hand withall\r\n    and newe made with convenyent speede Item he to see also all\r\n    her Highnes saied shippes furnysshed with sailles, anchors,\r\n    cables, and other tackell and apparell sufficientlye Item he\r\n    to cause the wagis and victuallinge of the shipp keepers and\r\n    woorkmen in harborough to be paied and dischardged Item he to\r\n    cause a masse of victual to be alwayes in redynes to serve for\r\n    1000 men for a moneth to be sette to the sea upon eny sodeyne\r\n    Item he to cause the saied shippes from tyme to tyme to be\r\n    repaired and renewed as occasion shall requiere Item whenn\r\n    the saied shippes that ar to be renewed shalbe newe made and\r\n    sufficientlie repaired and the hole navie furnyshed of saylles,\r\n    anckers, cables, and other tackell then is the saied Lord\r\n    Treasowrer content to contynue this servis in fourme aforesaied\r\n    for the some of £10,000 yerely to be advaunced as is aforesaied\r\n    Item the saied Benjamyn Gonson and Edward Bashe Surveyor of the\r\n    Victuells of the shippes shall make theare severall accomptes\r\n    of the defrayment of the saied money and of theare hole doinges\r\n    herein once in the yere at the least and as often besydes as\r\n    shall be thowght convenyent by my Lordes of the Counsell.’\r\n\r\nAny surplusage was to be carried forward towards the next year’s\r\nexpenses; the division of the money was, by estimation, £2000 for stores,\r\n£1000 for rigging, £6000 for harbour wages and victualling, and £5000\r\nfor the building and repair of ships.[494] By 1558 the allowance was\r\nreduced to £12,000 a year, but even the proposed minimum of £10,000 was\r\nmuch above anything allowed by Elizabeth during the greater part of her\r\nreign. Moreover, the large scheme of rebuilding outlined in this paper\r\nindirectly confirms the statement of the writer in the _Cecil MSS._[495]\r\nin assigning numerous new, _i.e._ rebuilt, ships to 1558. Obviously the\r\ncircumstance of the Queen being overworked was not by itself any reason\r\nwhy the real control should be taken from the Lord Admiral and other\r\nOfficers and given to the Lord Treasurer. The fact that payment was\r\nnow to be made in gross to Gonson of so many thousands a year instead\r\nof, as formerly, by warrant for each separate matter, will explain the\r\nnecessity for some new check on the Navy Treasurer, but will not explain\r\nthe practical supersession of the Lord Admiral. As long as Burleigh was\r\nLord Treasurer he also remained the final authority on naval matters,\r\npractically exercising the authority of a First Lord of the Admiralty of\r\nthe present day. The system of accounts now adopted endured, with some\r\nmodifications, for nearly a century, and to the order which prescribed\r\nthe rendering of a full statement once a year we owe the series of\r\n_Audit_, or _Pipe Office Accounts_, an invaluable source of information\r\nfor naval history.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Expenditure and Establishments.]\r\n\r\nThe average of wages all round had risen to 9s 4d a month ‘dead shares\r\nand rewards included;’ this, judging from the early years of the next\r\nreign, meant 6s 8d a month for the seamen. The custom of providing the\r\nmen with coats and jackets was dying out. There are no references to\r\nthese articles in the naval papers of the reign, but in a semi-official\r\nexpedition, that of Willoughby and Chancellor in 1553, the instructions\r\ndirect that the ‘liveries in apparel’ were only to be worn by the sailors\r\non state occasions. At other times they were to be kept in the care of\r\nthe supercargoes and ordinary clothes were to be sold to the crews at\r\ncost price.[496]\r\n\r\nThe one return of expenses remaining shows an extremely heavy naval\r\nexpenditure.[497] Between 1st January 1557 and 31st December 1558\r\n£157,638 was spent, of which victualling took £73,503, Deptford £22,120,\r\nWoolwich £4048, Gillingham £408, Portsmouth £7521, and wages of men at\r\nsea £43,492. Stores, such as timber, pitch, tar, cordage, etc., absorbed\r\nnearly £20,000, included under the dockyard headings. From this account\r\nit also appears that Legge when Treasurer, probably therefore in the\r\nreign of Henry VIII, had advanced £100 to two Lincolnshire men for seven\r\nyears in order to assist the creation of another centre of the cordage\r\nindustry. The experiment was not successful and the item is carried\r\nover formally in each successive account until dropped as a bad debt.\r\nVictualling storehouses for the government had been built or bought at\r\nRatcliff, Rochester, Gillingham and Portsmouth; ordnance wharves at\r\nWoolwich, Portsmouth and Porchester. Portsmouth was momentarily regaining\r\nfavour, and the Council recommended that ships should be laid up there\r\nbecause the harbour afforded better opportunity for rapid action in the\r\nChannel than did the Thames. The chief shipwright was now Peter Pett who\r\nwas receiving a fee of one shilling a day from the Exchequer in addition\r\nto the ordinary payments made to him by the Admiralty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disease on Shipboard.]\r\n\r\nWar was declared with France on 7th June 1557, but the operations of 1558\r\nwere nullified by an outbreak of disease in the fleet as severe as that\r\nof 1545. In 1557 Howard informed the Council that he could not obtain at\r\nDover ‘in a weke so moche victulls as wold victull ii pynnesses,’ and\r\nalthough the complaint is a year earlier the character of the supplies\r\nand the hardships it connotes, are very likely the key to the visitation\r\nof the following summer. From the 5th to 17th August Clynton lay at St\r\nHelens with the fleet, having returned from the capture and destruction\r\nof Conquet. On the 18th he put to sea, and on the 20th was near the\r\nChannel Islands, when so sudden an outburst occurred ‘that I thinke\r\nthe lieke was never syne ffor ther wer many ships that halfe the men\r\nwer throwen downe sick at once.’[498] After holding a council with his\r\ncaptains, which the masters of his ships also attended, he returned to\r\nPortsmouth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Privateering and Piracy.]\r\n\r\nPrivateering was encouraged by a proclamation of 8th July 1557,\r\npermitting any one to fit out vessels against the royal enemies, and\r\nallowing possession to be retained of all ships and goods captured\r\n‘withoute making accompte in any courte or place of this realme,’ and\r\nwithout payment of any dues to the Lord Admiral or any other officer.\r\nThis entire abrogation of control increased the tendency to illegal\r\nacts even among the more honest adventurers; while Carews, Killigrews,\r\nTremaines, and the ubiquitous Strangways, and Thomson, industriously\r\nworking for themselves, the government had always with them. Thomson was\r\noff Scilly in 1556, with three ships, and was taken. When tried only\r\nhe and four others were condemned and the Council loudly complained\r\nof the partiality of the jury, a partiality which better explains the\r\nprevalence of piracy during these years than the accepted explanation\r\nof the inefficiency of the Navy. The two Killigrews, Thomas and Peter,\r\nwere, if not the worst, the most successful offenders and in 1556 were\r\nsufficiently enriched by their plunder to think of retiring to ‘some\r\nisland’ for the winter. They were frequently chased into French ports,\r\nbut to keep them there was beyond the power of the men-of-war, and the\r\nFrench authorities treated them with a neutrality more than benevolent.\r\n\r\nWhen we find a privateer belonging to the Lord Privy Seal attacking\r\nneutral vessels, and man-of-war officers boarding and robbing a Flemish\r\nmerchantman at Tilbury, it seems wonderful, in view of the excesses\r\nsuch incidents suggest among the majority with no sense of legal\r\nresponsibility, that commerce could have been carried on at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIZABETH\r\n\r\n1558-1603\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Naval Policy of Elizabeth.]\r\n\r\nHer subjects were occupied, during the greater portion of Elizabeth’s\r\nreign, in teaching their Queen the use of a navy, instruction that\r\nshe was the first English sovereign to put into practice on strategic\r\nprinciples. Yet study of the forty-five years of glorious naval history\r\non which her renown is mainly based, leaves the impression that more\r\nmight and should have been done with the Navy. That she preferred\r\ndiplomacy to force would have been a merit had the choice been founded\r\non an ethical detestation of the cruelty of war, instead of an ingenuous\r\nbelief in her own skill and the obtuseness of her antagonists. Under\r\nconditions more favourable to ascendancy at sea than have ever existed\r\nfor England, before or since, the successes of the Navy itself, as\r\ndistinguished from the expansion of the commercial marine, were, although\r\nrelatively great, limited by the hesitation with which the naval arm\r\nwas employed, the way in which the service was pecuniarily starved, and\r\nthe settled doctrine underlying her maritime essays that an expedition\r\nshould be of a character to return a profit on the outlay. And perhaps\r\nthe severest comment on her government lies in the fact that she was more\r\nliberal in her treatment of the Navy, than of any other department of the\r\nState. In February 1559 she possessed twenty-two effective ships of 100\r\ntons and upwards, in March 1603, twenty-nine; practically, therefore, she\r\ndid little more than replace those worn out by efflux of time, for only\r\ntwo were lost in warfare. If Henry VIII created a navy under the stimulus\r\nof a possible necessity it requires little imagination to conceive his\r\ncourse when the time had come, as it never came for him, to put forth\r\nevery effort in using it for the preservation of England.\r\n\r\nWhen Elizabeth succeeded to the throne, the possession of a fleet and\r\nan organised administration, the French royal navy, only a few years\r\nbefore an apparently serious competitor, had ceased to exist; the rivalry\r\nof Holland had not yet begun, and it is hardly an exaggeration to say\r\nthat a Spanish royal navy had never existed, in the sense of an ocean\r\ngoing service organised on a basis enabling it to act vigorously and\r\neffectively in any direction.[499] The opportunity had come therefore\r\nto a power with maritime ambition, the only one possessing an efficient\r\nfleet and naval control, and incited by religious differences and\r\ncommercial emulation. The altered situation brought to the front a\r\nband of men who, in the preceding century, would have been military\r\nadventurers in France, but who now, half traders, half pirates, handled\r\ntheir ships with the same strategic and tactical skill their ancestors\r\nexercised on land, and who, if they had been allowed a free hand, would\r\nhave brought Spain down in ruin instead of merely reducing her to a\r\ncondition of baffled impotence. They were not allowed a free hand. When\r\nacting for themselves they had the knowledge that if it suited the royal\r\npolicy of the moment repudiation of their deeds might mean, if not loss\r\nof life, at least loss of property and reputation. When in command of\r\nroyal fleets they were kept in touch with the government, hampered by\r\nvoluminous and contradictory instructions, and, above all, their efforts\r\nand successes rendered nugatory by the parsimony which kept the depots\r\nalways on the brink of exhaustion.\r\n\r\nIn naval, as in other matters, Elizabeth tried to make her subjects do\r\nthe work of the crown and therefore she frequently confined her action\r\nto taking a share with several ships in a privateering expedition,\r\nprepared by private individuals for their own profit. Such expeditions\r\nswell the list of ships employed at sea, and privateering as a source\r\nof injury to an enemy has its value, but such enterprises when forming\r\nthe whole effort of the State for a particular year show an insufficient\r\nacquaintance with the character of the operations required. Privateers\r\nwere equipped not with large objects but to secure profits for owners\r\nand crews. It sometimes happened that this purpose was at issue with\r\nthe wider views of the admiral in command, and the voyage became\r\nineffective where a similar number of men-of-war subject to discipline\r\nmight have done important service. The enormous increase in the merchant\r\nmarine which, it will be shown, characterised the reign, was in one way\r\ndisadvantageous since it induced the government to rely more on a _guerre\r\nde course_ than on the sustained and systematised action of the Royal\r\nNavy. Even when a great fleet was sent out the light in which Elizabeth\r\nregarded it is instructively shown in a letter to Nottingham, after the\r\nCadiz voyage of 1596, when he had asked for money to pay the men’s wages:\r\n\r\n    ‘though we have already written you divers letters to prevent\r\n    the inconvenience which we suspected would follow this journey\r\n    that it would be rather an action of honour and virtue against\r\n    the enemy and particular profit by spoil to the army than any\r\n    way profitable to ourself yet now we do plainly see by the\r\n    return of our whole fleet that the actions of hope are fully\r\n    finished without as much as surety of defraying the charge past\r\n    or that which is to come.[500]\r\n\r\nThe blow to Spanish power and prestige, or an ‘action of honour and\r\nvirtue,’ counted for nothing if a fleet did not pay its expenses and make\r\nsome profit over and above.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked then in what respect was Elizabeth personally deserving\r\nof praise? The answer is that it fell to her to use for the first time\r\nan untried weapon—untried in the sense that never before had England\r\nrelied on it as the right arm of attack or defence. For centuries the\r\ndefence of the country had depended on the mail-clad horseman and the\r\nyeoman archer; from the first days of her accession she recognised that\r\nthe enemies of England were to be fought at sea, a doctrine which is a\r\ncommonplace now, but was then being only slowly evolved in minds even yet\r\ndazzled by memories of invasions of France. She accepted and proved the\r\ntruth of the theory on which the policy of Henry VIII was grounded, and,\r\nif she failed to carry it out fully, it was perhaps more from ignorance\r\nof the might of the weapon in her hand than from want of statesmanship.\r\nNotwithstanding her niggardliness, which nearly ruined England in 1588,\r\nshe expended money—for her lavishly—on the Navy, while the military and\r\nother services were remorselessly starved. Sooner or later the naval\r\nauthorities obtained at least part of their requirements, in striking\r\ncontrast to the fortune of other officials who thought, and whose\r\ncontemporaries probably thought, their needs of equal or more importance.\r\nIf she did not use the fleet as some of the great seamen who served her\r\nwould have had her use it, she at anyrate extended its field of action\r\nin a manner hitherto unknown, and sealed the direction of future English\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nThe following abstract, compiled from the pay and victualling lists and\r\nthe State Papers, will show the number of vessels of the Royal Navy in\r\ncommission each year, that it was used continuously as never before,\r\nbut also that it was seldom used up to its possible capacity. In every\r\ncase there were hired merchantmen as well if a fleet was engaged in an\r\nover-sea expedition, but unless there was a prospect of plunder the brunt\r\nof the work always fell on the men-of-war. As an arbitrary division, for\r\nthe purpose of the table, first-rates are taken as those above 600 tons;\r\nsecond-rates from 400 to 600 tons; third-rates from 200 to 400 tons;\r\nfourth-rates from 100 to 200 tons; fifth-rates from 50 to 100 tons; and\r\nsixth-rates under 50 tons. Owing to technical difficulties connected with\r\nthe lists used it is probably not exactly correct but is sufficiently so\r\nto give a just impression:—\r\n\r\n  +-----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+--------+\r\n  |           |1st|2nd|3rd|4th|5th|6th|Galleys.|\r\n  +-----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+--------+\r\n  | 1559      |   |   |   | 2 | 4 |   |        |\r\n  | 1560[501] |   |   |   |   |   |   |        |\r\n  | 1561      |   |   | 1 | 1 | 2 |   |   1    |\r\n  | 1562      |   | 2 | 4 | 1 | 5 |   |        |\r\n  | 1563      | 2 | 1 | 9 | 1 | 7 | 4 |   3    |\r\n  | 1564      |   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 |   |        |\r\n  | 1565      |   |   |   | 2 |   |   |        |\r\n  | 1566      |   |   |   | 1 | 2 |   |        |\r\n  | 1567      |   | 1 |   | 1 | 1 |   |        |\r\n  | 1568      |   |   | 2 | 1 | 1 |   |        |\r\n  | 1569      |   | 3 | 4 | 2 | 2 |   |        |\r\n  | 1570      |   | 3 | 3 | 3 | 2 |   |        |\r\n  | 1571      |   |   |   | 2 | 1 |   |        |\r\n  | 1572      |   |   |   | 2 | 2 |   |        |\r\n  | 1573      |   | 1 | 1 | 3 | 1 |   |        |\r\n  | 1574      |   |   |   | 2 | 1 |   |        |\r\n  | 1575      |   |   |   | 2 | 1 |   |        |\r\n  | 1576      |   | 1 | 3 | 2 | 2 |   |        |\r\n  | 1577      |   | 1 | 2 | 2 |   |   |        |\r\n  | 1578      |   | 2 | 3 | 1 |   |   |        |\r\n  | 1579      |   | 1 | 3 | 3 | 1 |   |        |\r\n  | 1580      |   | 1 | 6 | 2 | 1 |   |        |\r\n  | 1581      |   |   | 2 | 5 | 1 |   |        |\r\n  | 1582      |   |   | 1 | 2 | 1 |   |        |\r\n  | 1583      |   |   |   | 2 | 1 | 1 |        |\r\n  | 1584      |   |   |   | 2 | 1 | 1 |        |\r\n  | 1585      |   | 1 | 2 | 4 |   |   |        |\r\n  | 1586      |   | 3 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 7 |   1    |\r\n  | 1587      |   | 3 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 6 |        |\r\n  | 1588[502] | 5 |10 | 5 | 3 | 7 | 3 |   1    |\r\n  | 1589      |   | 4 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 4 |        |\r\n  | 1590      |   | 8 | 4 | 6 | 2 | 5 |        |\r\n  | 1591      |   | 8 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 4 |        |\r\n  | 1592      |   | 2 | 4 | 2 | 2 | 3 |        |\r\n  | 1593      |   | 1 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 |        |\r\n  | 1594      |   | 1 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 4 |        |\r\n  | 1595      |   | 4 | 4 | 1 | 2 | 3 |        |\r\n  | 1596      | 4 | 9 | 5 | 3 | 2 | 1 |        |\r\n  | 1597      | 6 |11 | 6 | 1 | 2 | 2 |        |\r\n  | 1598      |   | 5 | 5 | 2 | 2 | 4 |        |\r\n  | 1599      | 6 |10 | 6 | 2 | 2 | 7 |   1    |\r\n  | 1600      | 2 | 2 | 5 | 1 | 1 | 5 |        |\r\n  | 1601      | 2 |11 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 3 |        |\r\n  | 1602      | 3 | 9 | 5 |   | 1 | 1 |        |\r\n  +-----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+--------+\r\n\r\nFrom this it is evident that vessels of from 400 to 600 tons were the\r\nfavourites; they were handier, better seaboats, and represented the\r\nlatest improvements in shipbuilding. Of the eleven first-rates on the\r\nnavy list in 1603, two were Spanish prizes of 1596, four dated from the\r\nbeginning of the reign, while the remaining five were of 1587 and later\r\nyears; it was these latter that were used from 1596 onwards. The four\r\nearlier ones, built before Hawkyns came into office, were of an old type\r\nand seem never to have been commissioned unless the services of the\r\nwhole Navy were required. The _Victory_, for instance was only at sea\r\nin 1563, 1588, and 1589, although she is not entered in the foregoing\r\ntable under 1589, because lent to the Earl of Cumberland for a private\r\nventure. The stress of the work fell therefore on the smaller vessels.\r\nThe _Bonaventure_, for instance, was at sea every year from 1585 to 1590\r\ninclusive. During the greater part of 1591 she was in dock at Woolwich\r\nfor repairs, but at Portsmouth in October, and then sent to sea. Again\r\nin 1592, 5, 6, 7, and 1599. The _Dreadnought_, launched in 1573, was\r\ncommissioned during each of the six years 1575-80, and in 1585, 7, 8, and\r\n1590. She was then, for nearly a year, in dry dock, recommencing service\r\nin 1594, continuing it in 1595, 6, 7, 9, 1601, 2, and 1603. It must also\r\nbe noted that many of these years included more than one commission.\r\nExcluding the fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-rates, which were serviceable\r\nfor privateering purpose, but could not take a place in any form of\r\nattack requiring ships of force, it will be seen by how very few vessels\r\nthe naval warfare was really carried on, and that a succession of serious\r\ndescents on the Spanish coasts and transatlantic settlements, such as\r\nwere urged on Elizabeth, would have necessitated very large additions to\r\nthe Royal Navy.\r\n\r\nShortly after the Queen’s accession she possessed, according to one\r\naccount thirty-five,[503] and according to another thirty-two[504]\r\nvessels of all classes and in good and bad condition. Some ships had been\r\nunder repair before Mary’s death,[505] but the dockyards were working\r\nwith redoubled vigour since Elizabeth’s succession. At Deptford, in\r\nMarch, 228 men were at work on five ships; at Woolwich 175 men on eight\r\nothers, and at Portsmouth 154 men on nine more.[506] Some of these were\r\nrebuildings, others could have been but trifling repairs, but the list\r\nshows with what energy Elizabeth and her Council applied themselves\r\nto the maintenance of the fleet. From that time the yards, with the\r\nexception of a few years, were kept fully occupied, and the following is\r\na list of the new ships built at them or otherwise added to the Navy.

It has been noticed that the term rebuilding, as\r\nused in the official papers, is extremely vague and it is only when the\r\ncost per ton can be ascertained that it can be known with certainty\r\nwhether a ship was renewed or repaired; it is quite possible that, with\r\nthe exception of the _Philip and Mary_, the rebuilt vessels were in\r\nreality only subjected to more or less complete repair. Again, of these\r\ntwenty-nine only twenty-one were of 300 tons and upwards and suited\r\nfor distant expeditions; of the twenty-one the _Elizabeth_, _Hope_,\r\n_Victory_, _Triumph_, and _White Bear_, were not liked—too big, too\r\nexpensive, or too unhandy—and were never used unless a fleet of great\r\nstrength was required. The names of a few ships recur, therefore, year\r\nafter year as forming the main strength of the squadrons, made up with\r\narmed merchantmen, sent out for various purposes. Had Spain been able\r\nto offer any real resistance at sea the destructive results of even\r\nvictorious action would have soon compelled the replacement of these\r\nships and a large increase in the navy list.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Various Ships.]\r\n\r\nThe _Elizabeth Jonas_ varies as to tonnage between 855 and 1000 tons in\r\ndifferent papers. The _Victory_ oscillates between 694 and 800 tons, the\r\n_Triumph_ between 955 and 1200, and a smaller vessel, the _Foresight_, is\r\ngiven in three lists, within six years, as of 300, 350, then of 260 tons,\r\nand in a fourth list of 1592 as of 450 tons. Before 1582 measurement\r\nmust have been usually a matter of opinion and comparison; after that\r\nyear when Baker’s rule had come into use there is more uniformity. But\r\nsuch variations entirely vitiate dogmatic comparisons of the strength\r\nof opposing ships or squadrons. The _Elizabeth_ was, ‘in new making’ at\r\nWoolwich in December 1558,[576] and was therefore commenced before Mary’s\r\ndeath. There is a singular story told of the origin of the name.\r\n\r\n    ‘The shipp called the _Elizabeth Jonas_ was so named by her\r\n    Grace in remembrance of her owne deliverance from the furye\r\n    of her enemyes from which in one respect she was no lesse\r\n    myraculously preserved than was the prophet Jonas from the\r\n    belly of the whale.’[577]\r\n\r\nThis occurs in a commonplace book kept by Robert Commaundre, Rector\r\nof Tarporley, Chester, who died in 1613, and among some other naval\r\ninformation wholly incorrect. It is a fact that Elizabeth christened the\r\nship herself but Commaundre’s version is probably country gossip made to\r\nexplain the name. If, however, it should be true it throws a more vivid\r\nlight on Elizabeth’s real feeling towards her unhappy sister than is shed\r\nby many volumes of State Papers.\r\n\r\nThe first occurrence of the famous name of the _Victory_ in an English\r\nnavy list is of great interest but unfortunately cannot be dated with\r\ncertainty. The earliest mention known is of the victualling accounts\r\nof the quarter ending with September 1562.[578] On 14th March 1560,\r\nthe _Great Christopher_, of 800 tons, was bought of Ant. Hickman and\r\nEd. Castlyn, two London merchants. The tonnage corresponds with that\r\nassigned to the _Victory_ in early papers, and the year corresponds with\r\nthat assigned to the _Victory_ in the State Paper quoted in the table.\r\nThe name _Great Christopher_ is only found down to 1562, when it is\r\nimmediately succeeded by that of _Victory_; in fact the _Christopher_\r\nis named in October and then ceases, to be replaced by the _Victory_ in\r\nNovember.[579] Unless we suppose that a new 800-ton ship, one of the two\r\nlargest in the Navy, disappeared without leaving a trace of the cause it\r\nmust be assumed that the name was changed, a not unusual occurrence, and\r\nif so, the _Victory_ is its only possible representative. The name was\r\nquite new among English men-of-war; it may have been taken from that of\r\nMagellan’s celebrated ship.\r\n\r\nThe _Primrose_ and the _Minion_ had for some years previously been\r\nemployed among the hired London merchantmen; from 1560 they appear on\r\nthe navy lists, which points to their purchase. The _Minion_, in which\r\nHawkyns escaped from San Juan de Ulloa in 1568, was condemned in 1570;\r\nthe _Primrose_ was sold in 1575, again rejoining the merchant service,\r\nto which she still belonged in 1583.[580] The galleys _Tryright_ and\r\n_Speedwell_ disappear after 1579; and the _Bonavolia_ from 1599; of the\r\nfour later galleys the _Gallarita_ and _Volatillia_ were presented by\r\nthe city of London. The _Mercury_, another vessel of the galley type was\r\nhowever furnished with masts and sails, and afterwards converted into a\r\npinnace.\r\n\r\nReturning to the large ships, the _Aid_ was condemned in 1599, the\r\n_Elizabeth Bonaventure_, purchased from Walter Jobson for £2230, the\r\n_Bull_ was broken up in 1594, and the _Revenge_ captured by a Spanish\r\nfleet in 1591. The _Tiger_, _Scout_, and _Achates_, were cut down into\r\nlighters and, in 1603, were supporting Upnor chain. The _Ark Royal_,\r\nor _Ark Ralegh_, seems to have been built originally for Sir Walter\r\nRalegh,[581] although constructed in a royal yard and by a government\r\nshipwright, who, later, received a pension for this among other services.\r\nSome £1200 was spent in 1598 on the repairs of the _St Mathew_ and _St\r\nAndrew_; they only served under the English flag, however, in the Islands\r\nvoyage of 1597. Some of the small pinnaces disappear from the lists\r\nduring these years without assigned cause, but the only two vessels known\r\nto have been lost by stress of weather during the reign were the earlier\r\n_Greyhound_ of Henry VIII, wrecked off Rye in 1562, and the _Lion’s\r\nWhelp_ in 1591.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Table of General Details.]\r\n\r\nThe following table of 1602 furnishes many curious

we have in the preceding table for the first\r\ntime an attempt at exactness instead of the former round numbers. The\r\nkeel and other measurements given can only be taken as approximate\r\nseeing that they differ in nearly every paper. And some of the other\r\nparticulars, such as the number of anchors and cables, represent only\r\na theoretical equipment; the inventories show that vessels frequently\r\ncarried more than the seven anchors and seven cables assigned to the\r\nlarge ones here. On the other hand the strength of the crews rarely\r\nreached the proportions in the list, it may safely be said never, if a\r\nlarge fleet was prepared.\r\n\r\nThe great Portuguese carrack, the _Madre de Dios_, captured in 1592 and\r\nregarded as the largest ship afloat, had a keel length of 100 feet,\r\nan extreme breath of 46 feet 10 inches, and an extreme length of 165\r\nfeet.[583] The keel length of the _Rainbow_ being 100 feet, her extreme\r\nlength was 139 feet 6 inches and she had only 32 feet of beam. Moreover\r\nthe carrack would be hampered by tiers of cabins built up on her poop\r\nand forecastle; a comparison of these proportions will help to explain\r\nthe better weatherly and sailing qualities of the English ships. If for\r\nfurther illustration we compare the _Elizabeth Jonas_ carrying 55 heavy\r\nguns,[584] with a 52 gun ship of 1832 we find that the ordnance of the\r\nlatter weighed 125 tons 4 cwt.; cables (iron and hempen), 56 tons 1 cwt.;\r\nanchors 12 tons 10 cwt. 2 qrs.; masts and yards 74 tons 5 cwt.; and fixed\r\nand running rigging 51 tons 9 cwt.[585]\r\n\r\nThis table also explains why galleys, never much in favour, were rapidly\r\nfalling out of use. In 1588 the _Bonavolia_ served for two months as a\r\nguardship in the river at a total cost of £1028,[586] that is to say £514\r\na month. In 1589 there is an estimate, in the handwriting of Hawkyns,\r\nfor the same galley but 150 ‘slaves’ are now allowed for, and ‘there may\r\nbe for every bank[587] a soldier with his piece if the service require\r\nit.’ He adds ‘there is no dyett spoken of for the slaves for that we are\r\nnot yett in the experyence.’[588] We cannot now tell whether Hawkyns had\r\nhis early merchandise of negroes in his mind or whether ‘slaves’ was the\r\npleasant Elizabethan way of describing criminals and vagrants.[589] The\r\nreference however, to ignorance in the matter of diet seems rather to\r\nimply that negroes were in question. Doubtless the cost of free oarsmen\r\nhad been found to be too great. It will be observed that a large cruiser\r\nlike the _Dreadnought_ could be kept at sea throughout the year at a\r\ncharge of £303 a month while the almost useless galley, only doubtfully\r\navailable in summer, cost very much more. The galley service was only\r\npossible among the Mediterranean states, and then only when, like Venice,\r\nthey bought surplus human stock by the thousand from the Emperor. The\r\nfour galleys of 1601-2 were never once engaged in active service, and\r\nwere probably only used for purposes for which steam tugs are now\r\nemployed; perhaps also in pageants, men from the royal ships or ordinary\r\nwatermen being put in them for the particular service.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Types of Ships.]\r\n\r\nThe lines of ships had begun to vary according to the purpose for which\r\nthey were designed. There had formerly been no difference between\r\nmerchantmen and men-of-war except that the latter were perhaps more\r\nstrongly built. But a paper by William Borough, Comptroller of the Navy,\r\nnow describes three orders:—[590]\r\n\r\n  1. The shortest, broadest, and    { To have the length by the keel\r\n     deepest order.                 { double the breadth amidships and the\r\n                                    { depth in hold half that breadth.\r\n\r\n        This order is used in some merchant ships for most profit.\r\n\r\n  2. The mean and best proportion   { Length of keel two or two and a\r\n     for shipping for merchandise,  { quarter that of beam. Depth of hold\r\n     likewise very serviceable for  { eleven-twentyfourths that of beam.\r\n     all purposes.\r\n\r\n  3. The largest order for galleons { Length of keel three times the\r\n     or ships for the wars made for { beam. Depth of hold two-fifths of\r\n     the most advantage of sailing. { beam.\r\n\r\nIf the figures in the preceding table are trustworthy it will be seen\r\nthat the keel length is very seldom three times the breadth although the\r\nlater ships show a drift towards that proportion. The short keel, not\r\nsufficiently supported in a head sea must have made the vessel pitch\r\ntremendously, and one object of the beakhead and great forward rake was\r\nto shatter the seas and prevent them breaking on board. Probably these\r\nships were but little worse sailers than the ordinary merchantmen of the\r\nbeginning of this century, at least before the wind. They could not sail\r\non the wind within at least eight points; fore and aft sails were not yet\r\nknown, and the top-hamper of lofty sides and built up poop and forecastle\r\nlevered the vessel off to leeward.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Improvements and Inventions.]\r\n\r\nMany improvements however were introduced. A method of striking topmasts,\r\n‘a wonderful ease to great ships,’ and a system of sheathing by double\r\nplanks, having a layer of tar and hair between them, were two of the most\r\nimportant. Both were due to Hawkyns, and the sheathing process remained\r\nin use for more than a century after his death. The finest Elizabethan\r\nmen-of-war, the fastest sailers and best seaboats then afloat were built\r\nfrom his plans; and from the time of his appointment as Treasurer of\r\nthe Navy dates the change to the relatively low and long type that made\r\nthe English ships so much more handy than their Spanish antagonists. On\r\nRalegh’s testimony the chain pump, the use of the capstan for weighing\r\nthe anchor, bonnets and drablers, sprit, studding, top, and top-gallant\r\nsails were all new.[591] Ralegh is usually accepted as an authority, but\r\nsome of these statements are surprisingly inaccurate, considering that\r\nhe was a shipowner, and had himself been to sea. The bonnet, which laced\r\non to the foot of the ordinary sail, was in use at least as early as the\r\nfourteenth century: the drabler laced on to the bonnet, and if the name\r\nwas new the thing itself was doubtless old. Top, top-gallant, and sprit\r\nsails, can be traced back to the close of the preceding century, and\r\nthere is no reference to studding sails in the inventories. In view also\r\nof the ‘main,’ ‘forecastle,’ and ‘lift’ capstans found on a ship like the\r\n_Sovereign_ in 1496 it seems incredible that they should not have been\r\nearlier applied to weighing the anchor.\r\n\r\nThe chain pump was brought into use by Hawkyns; a patent log was invented\r\nby Humphrey Cole but it does not appear to have superseded the ordinary\r\nlog line. The lower ports were now some four feet above the water line,\r\nand there was a tendency to decrease the deck superstructures. Ralegh is\r\nemphatic in his disapproval of deck cabins: ‘they are but sluttish dens\r\nthat breed sickness in peace, serving to cover stealths, and in fight are\r\ndangerous to tear men with their splinters.’ Nevertheless others thought\r\ndifferently, and in view of the large crew of a man-of-war and crowded\r\nnarrow quarters some deck accommodation was perhaps absolutely essential.\r\nBoth poop and forecastle were barricaded and the bulkheads pierced for\r\narrow and musketry fire. In ships ‘built loftie’ there was a second,\r\nand perhaps even a third tier over the poop and forecastle of similarly\r\ndefended cabins. The waist was partly open on the upper deck, while on\r\nthe lower deck were again loop-holed bulkheads running transversely, so\r\nthat if a ship were boarded her assailants found themselves exposed to a\r\ngalling cross-fire from the defenders.\r\n\r\nGravel ballast only was used and for such crank vessels a large quantity\r\nwas necessary. It was seldom changed and becoming soaked with bilgewater,\r\ndrainings from beer casks, and the general waste of a ship, was a source\r\nof injury to the vessel and of danger to the health of the men. The\r\n‘cook-room,’ a solid structure of bricks and mortar, was built in the\r\nhold on this ballast, and in that position, besides making the ship hot\r\nand spoiling the stores, was a frequent cause of fire. Moreover ballast\r\nand cook-room being practically immovable nothing could be known of the\r\ncondition of the timber and ironwork below. Sir William Wynter advocated,\r\nin 1578, the use of stone ballast and the removal of the cooking galley\r\nto the forecastle, but neither proposal was generally adopted.[592] In\r\nthe squadron commanded by Hawkyns and Frobisher in 1590 the _Mary Rose_,\r\nhowever, Hawkyns’ flagship, had her cook-room especially removed from\r\nthe hold to the forecastle, ‘as well for the better stowinge of her\r\nvictualles as also for better preserving her whole companie in health\r\nduring that voyadge beinge bounde to the southwardes.’ We may therefore\r\ntake it that the opinion of Hawkyns coincided with that of Wynter on this\r\npoint. But the alteration in the _Mary Rose_ was an isolated occurrence,\r\nand even as late as the beginning of the eighteenth century the galley\r\nwas still sometimes in the hold. The large amount of space occupied by\r\nthe ballast, cables, ammunition, and other necessaries left but little\r\nroom for other things, and a ship had only provisions on board for three\r\nor four weeks, although theoretically she was expected to carry more. The\r\npresence of a fleet of transports was therefore necessary with all naval\r\nexpeditions.\r\n\r\nThe attention given to maritime matters bore fruit in other inventions,\r\nmany of them far in advance of their time. Centre board boats,\r\npaddlewheels, a diving dress, and fireships, were all recommended and\r\nperhaps used.[593] Gawen Smith proposed to erect a beacon and refuge,\r\ncapable of holding twenty or thirty persons, on the Goodwin sands\r\nsuch as was actually tried, unsuccessfully, in the first half of this\r\ncentury.[594]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cost and Construction of Ships.]\r\n\r\nThere is no detailed statement of the whole cost of a ship complete. Most\r\nwere built by contract, and payment to the master shipwright responsible\r\nappears to be only for the hull, masts and spars. For an early vessel,\r\nprobably the _Triumph_, there is a fuller account[595] and here the total\r\nis £3788, of which the timber cost £1200, spars and ironwork £700, and\r\nwages £1888; this does not include sails, fittings, etc. Building by\r\ncontract seems to have commenced with the accession to office of Hawkyns\r\nin 1578. The _Lion_ was rebuilt in this manner in 1582 for £1440, the\r\n_Nonpareil_ for £1600, the _Hope_ ‘brought into the fourme of a galease’\r\n£250,[596] and the _Cygnet_, and _Greyhound_ built for £93, 18s 1d and\r\n£66, 13s 4d each.[597] The _Victory_ was ‘altered into the forme of a\r\ngalleon’ for £500, and the _Vanguard_ and _Rainbow_ built for £2600,\r\napiece.[598] The _Merhonour_, _Garland_, and _Defiance_, cost £5, 2s,\r\n£5, 19s 5d, and £6, 7s 4d a ton,[599] and the price was based on the\r\nnet tonnage. These rates do not however correspond with the amounts in\r\nthe naval accounts which are £3600 for the _Merhonour_, £3200 for the\r\n_Garland_, and £3000 for the _Defiance_.\r\n\r\nThe earliest details we have of construction are in connection with these\r\nthree vessels. A committee consisting of Howard, Drake, Hawkyns, Wynter,\r\nBorough, Ed. Fenton, Rich. Chapman, and Mathew and Christopher Baker,\r\nsettled the plans.[600] The three were very similar, and it was decided\r\nthat the one to be built by Peter Pett (the _Defiance_) should have a\r\nkeel length of 92 feet, a beam of 32 feet, and be 15 feet deep ‘under the\r\nbeame of the maine overloppe.’ Eight feet above the keel ten beams were\r\nto be placed on which ‘to lay a false overloppe so far as neede shall\r\nrequire,’ and under the ten beams ten riders were to be set; the riders\r\nat the footwales were to have two ‘sleepers on every side fore and afte,’\r\nand pillars to be sufficiently bolted to them. The pillars supporting the\r\nlower deck had been newly adopted,[601] and as riders were put into the\r\n_White Bear_ twenty years after she was built they also were possibly a\r\nrecent improvement. The main, or lower deck, of the _Defiance_ was to\r\nhave twelve beams, with side knees and standards, every knee having four\r\nbolts and the deck itself was of three-inch plank. The upper deck was of\r\ntwo-and-a-half inch plank, but three inches in the waist; on this deck\r\nwere the poop and forecastle. From the keel to the second wale four-inch\r\nplank was to be used, thence to the ‘quickside or waist,’ three-inch,\r\nand above that two-inch ‘rabbated to the railles to be inbowed to goe\r\nto the shippes side,’ On the orlop deck there were to be cabins for\r\nthe boatswain, surgeon, gunner, and carpenter; the ship’s company were\r\nberthed on the main deck.\r\n\r\nThe _Merhonour_, and _Garland_, differed only in details, therefore these\r\nvessels, one of which was the third largest in the Royal Navy, were not\r\neven two-deckers in the modern sense. Three-deckers were unknown in\r\nthe English service and, beyond the existence of a print, diagrammatic\r\nin character, in the British Museum, which is said, on insufficient\r\nauthority, to represent the _Ark Royal_, there is no ground for supposing\r\nthat two-deckers were in use. The _Warspite_, of 648 tons, had possibly\r\nonly one ordnance deck but certainly not more than one-and-a-half;\r\n‘having an overloppe and deck before and after, and a half deck abaft\r\nthe main mast.’[602] She was ‘planked between the two lower walles and\r\nfrom the lower walle down to the keele with four-inch plank, and from\r\nthe second walle upwards to the cheyne walle with three-inch plank, and\r\nfrom the cheyne walles to the railes upwards on the waste with two-inch\r\nplank.’ The _Warspite_ was one of the few shipbuilding failures of the\r\nreign. In 1598, although a nearly new ship, she cost £712 for repairs and\r\nfurther sums were spent on her in the succeeding years.\r\n\r\nThe illustration of an Elizabethan man-of-war, reproduced from a drawing\r\nin a Bodleian MS., shows some marked differences from the _Tiger_ of\r\nHenry VIII. She is probably a vessel of the earlier portion of the reign;\r\nperhaps the _Bull_ or _Tiger_ of 1570. So far as the hull is concerned,\r\nthere is distinct retrogression in that the keel is relatively shorter to\r\nthe extreme length, and that the poop is built up to a disproportionate\r\nand unseaworthy extent. This last may be explained by the fact that the\r\nearlier _Tiger_ was not expected to be called upon to serve outside the\r\nfour seas, while the later ship had a wider cruising scope. The extended\r\nfield of service called for larger crews, and as the orlop deck was not\r\nintroduced till late in the reign, the increased accommodation necessary\r\nwas obtained by the provision of more deck structures. In the matter of\r\nheavier masts and spars, possibly finer under water lines, larger sail\r\narea, and the multiplication of appliances for more rapid handling, there\r\nwas an undoubted advance on the earlier ship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Decoration of Ships.]\r\n\r\nPhilip’s ambassador told him in 1569 that ‘they expect to be able to\r\nrepel any attack by means of their fleet,’ and this confidence found\r\nnatural expression in an inclination to decorate and adorn the weapons\r\non which they relied. At any rate we now find specific payments for\r\nthese purposes made with a frequency new in naval history. The ‘carving\r\nof personages in timber,’ and painting and colouring of ships in 1563\r\ncost £121, 13s 8d and ‘painting and colouring red the great new ship\r\ncalled the _White Bear_‘[603] £20. Three ‘great personages in wood for\r\nthe garnishing and setting forth’ of the same vessel were £1, 15s each.\r\nThe upper works of the _Bonaventure_ were painted black and white,[604]\r\nand the _Lion_ in ‘timber colour;’ as the _White Bear_ was red, and the\r\n_Revenge_ and _Scout_, green and white there was evidently no regulation\r\ncolour. The _Bonaventure_ had a dragon on her beakhead, the royal arms\r\non her stern, and two lions and two dragons in gilt and paint on her\r\ngalleries. The _Foresight_ carried the Queen’s arms, a rose and a _fleur\r\nde lis_, on her stern, and in 1579 £2, 13s 4d was paid for carving a\r\nSaturn and a Salamander for the _Swallow_. Figure heads were usual. The\r\n_Nonpareil_, _Adventure_, _Dreadnought_ and _Hope_, had a dragon; the\r\n_Charles_, _Defiance_, _Rainbow_, _Repulse_ and _Garland_ a lion; the\r\n_Mary Rose_, a unicorn, and the _Swiftsure_ a tiger. When the _White\r\nBear_ was rebuilt the carvings included,\r\n\r\n    ‘an image of Jupiter sitting uppon an eagle with the cloudes,\r\n    before the heade of the shippe xiˡⁱ; twoe sidebordes for the\r\n    heade with compartments and badges and fruitages xˡⁱ; the\r\n    traynebord[605] with compartments and badges of both sides\r\n    viiˡⁱ; xvi brackets going round about the heade at xiiˢ the\r\n    pece; xxxviii peces of spoyle or artillarie round about the\r\n    shippe at xivˢ the pece; the greate pece of Neptune and the\r\n    Nymphes about him for the uprighte of the Sterne viˡⁱ xˢ.’[606]\r\n\r\nThe whole cost of carving was here £172, and of painting and gilding\r\n£205, 10s, but these appear to have been exceptional amounts. Painting\r\nthe _Bonaventure_ cost £23, 6s 8d, the _Dreadnought_ £20, the _Vanguard_\r\n£30, and the _Merhonour_ £40, and these sums more nearly represented the\r\nordinary expenditure. On the _Elizabeth_ however £180 was spent in 1598\r\nfor\r\n\r\n    ‘newe payntinge and guildinge with fine gold her beake heade\r\n    on both sides with Her Maiesties whole armes and supporters,\r\n    for payntinge the forecastle, the cubbridge heades[607] on the\r\n    wast, the outsides from stemme to sterne, for like payntinge\r\n    and newe guildinge of both the galleries with Her Maiesties\r\n    armes and supporters on both sides, the sterne newe paynted\r\n    with divers devices and beastes guilte with fine gold; for newe\r\n    payntinge the captens cabbon, the somer decke[608] as well\r\n    overhead as on the sides, the barbycan, the dyninge roome and\r\n    the studdie.’[609]\r\n\r\nThe _Rainbow’s_ lion figure head was gilt and on her sides were ‘planets,\r\nrainbows, and clouds’ with the royal arms on the upper, middle, and lower\r\ncounter, but the whole charge was only £58, 6s. Cabins were painted and\r\nupholstered in the favourite Tudor colour of green and ‘Her Maiesties\r\nbadge’ was painted in green and red. The _White Bear_ and the _Elizabeth_\r\nare the only two instances in which comparatively large sums are found to\r\nbe spent in ornament, and it does not appear that there was as yet more\r\nthan a bent towards general embellishment. The smaller vessels are never\r\nmentioned in this connexion. The opinion of a contemporary was that, both\r\nfor work and appearance,\r\n\r\n    ‘our navy is such as wanteth neither goodly, great, nor\r\n    beautiful ships who of mould are so clean made beneath, of\r\n    proportion so fine above, of sail so swift, the ports, fights,\r\n    coines, in them so well devised, with the ordnance so well\r\n    placed, that none of any other region may seem comparable unto\r\n    them.’[610]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tonnage Measurement.]\r\n\r\nThe new method of building by contract, and the large number of\r\nmerchantmen upon which the bounty was now paid, necessitated a more exact\r\nmeasurement of tonnage than had hitherto obtained. In 1582 a rule was\r\ndevised which remained in use for nearly half a century and was said to\r\nhave been due to Mathew Baker, son of the James Baker shipwright to Henry\r\nVIII, and himself one of the principal government shipwrights. The writer\r\nsays:[611]\r\n\r\n    ‘By the proportion of breadth, depth, and length of any ship\r\n    to judge what burden she may be of in merchant’s goods and\r\n    how much of dead weight of ton and tonnage. The _Ascension_\r\n    of London being in breadth 24 feet, depth 12 feet from that\r\n    breadth to the hold, and by the keel 54 feet in length doth\r\n    carry in burden of merchant’s goods (in pipes of oil or\r\n    Bordeaux wine) 160 tons, but to accompt her in dead weight, or\r\n    her ton and tonnage may be added one third part of the same\r\n    burden which maketh her tonnage 213⅓. After the same rate these\r\n    proportions follow:\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------+----------+---------+---------+-------+-------+\r\n  |                       |          |         |         |Burden |       |\r\n  |                       |Breadth at| Depth   |         |in cask| Dead  |\r\n  |                       | midship  |from her |  Keel   |of oil |weight |\r\n  |                       |  beam    | breadth |         |or wine|tonnage|\r\n  |                       +----------+---------+---------+-------+-------+\r\n  | A Ship of             |  20 ft.  |  10 ft. |  42 ft. |  86½  | 115   |\r\n  | A Ship of             |  21  ”   |  10½ ”  |  45  ”  | 102⅒ | 136⅛  |\r\n  | _Prudence_ of London  |  24  ”   |  12  ”  |  51½ ”  | 150½  | 202⅔  |\r\n  | _Golden Lion_         |  32  ”   |  12  ”  | 102  ”  | 403   | 537   |\r\n  |                       |          |or 14    |         |or 461 |or 614⅔|\r\n  | _Elizabeth Jonas_[612]|  40  ”   |  18  ”  | 100  ”  | 740   | 986⅔  |\r\n  +-----------------------+----------+---------+---------+-------+-------+\r\n\r\n    To find the burden of any ship proportionately to the\r\n    _Ascension_ before specified multiply the breadth of her by her\r\n    depth, and the product by her length at the keel, the amounting\r\n    sum you shall use as your divisor. If 15,552, the solid cubical\r\n    number for the _Ascension_ do give 160 tons, her just burthen,\r\n    what shall 8400, the solid number of a ship 20 feet broad, 10\r\n    feet deep, and 42 feet keel. Work and you shall find 86³⁴⁄₈₁\r\n    tons of burden while if you add one-third you shall find your\r\n    tonnage 114 almost.’\r\n\r\nThis formula made theory square with fact since the result corresponded\r\nwith the tuns of Bordeaux wine experience had shown a ship to be able\r\nto carry. But strictly, ‘burden’ and ‘ton and tonnage,’ as used here do\r\nnot correspond with our net and gross tonnage, since burden is used in\r\nconnexion with lighter material occupying more space than a heavy cargo,\r\nsuch as coal, that would be represented by ton and tonnage. The Spanish\r\nsystem of measurement in 1590 was to multiply half the breadth by depth\r\nof hold and the result by the length over all.[613] From this 5% was\r\ndeducted for the entry and run, and the remainder divided by eight, gave\r\nthe net tonnage; 20% was added to obtain the gross tonnage.[614]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Seamen.]\r\n\r\nAs early as 1561 the Venetian Resident considered England superior to its\r\nneighbours in naval strength,[615] but he may not have included Spain\r\namong the neighbours. The Spaniards officially in England kept Philip\r\nfully acquainted with the character and equipment of the fleet. He was\r\nalways apprised of any preparations, and in such detail that we find\r\nhim told on one occasion that twelve or fourteen ships were of from 400\r\nto 700 tons ‘with little top-hamper and very light, which is a great\r\nadvantage for close quarters, and with much artillery, the heavy pieces\r\nbeing close to the water.’[616] Eight years earlier his ambassador,\r\nDe Silva, recommended him to have ships built in England instead of\r\ncontinuing the chartering system in vogue in Spain as ‘certainly the\r\nships built here are very sound and good.’[617] These intimations\r\nprobably did not stand alone, but neither then nor later did they lead\r\nto any change in the type affected in the Peninsula. English seamen did\r\nnot favourably impress the Spaniards. One of Philip’s correspondents, in\r\nwriting to him that four men-of-war had been prepared for sea, added,\r\n‘the men in them are poor creatures.’[618] Six months later he was\r\ninformed that although Elizabeth possessed twenty-two large ships she\r\nhad only been able to fit eleven for sea, and would find it impossible\r\nto equip more, and that ‘the men on the fleet although they appear\r\nbellicose are really pampered and effeminate different from what they\r\nused to be.’[619] The estimate appears the more extraordinary because\r\nEnglish seamen were at this time giving daily proof, at the expense of\r\nSpanish and other commerce, of the wild energy animating them. As late\r\nas 1586, Mendoza wrote that four ships were in commission and others in\r\npreparation, but of these latter, only four were seaworthy, ‘all the rest\r\nbeing old and rotten.’[620] If Philip was continuously misinformed as to\r\nthe number of ships available, the difficulties in furnishing them, and\r\nthe fighting value of the men, it may help to explain the confidence he\r\nshowed later.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, there are very few complaints throughout the\r\nreign about embarrassments due to want of crews. The semi-piratical\r\nexpeditions preferred by the government were better liked than would have\r\nbeen a more regular warfare that would have meant harder fighting and\r\nfewer chances of plunder. Hatred of Spain and Popery, conjoined with the\r\nhoped for pillage of Spanish galleons, formed an inducement that never\r\nfailed to bring a sufficient number of men together, notwithstanding\r\nthat, as privateering speculations, most of the voyages were,\r\npecuniarily, failures, although they served their purpose in destroying\r\nSpanish commerce and credit. The proportion of men on board a man-of-war\r\nwas three to every five tons, of gross tonnage; one-third being\r\nsoldiers, one-seventh of the remainder, gunners; and the rest seamen.\r\nIn merchantmen the ratio was one man to every five tons of net tonnage,\r\none-twelfth being gunners and the rest seamen.[621] But in practice the\r\nstrength of a crew depended on the number of men required and the success\r\nof the impress authorities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Seamen:—Pay and Rewards.]\r\n\r\nUntil 1585 the wages remained at 6s 8d a month, to which it had been\r\nraised in 1546 or very shortly afterwards. In 1585, the sailor’s pay\r\nwas raised to ten shillings a month, through the action of Hawkyns.\r\nThere must have been some dissatisfaction with the quality of the\r\nmen hitherto serving, and the breach with Spain doubtless made an\r\nimprovement necessary. Hawkyns coated the pill for Elizabeth by assuring\r\nher that fewer men would be required, of the standard to be attracted\r\nby the higher rate, and, ‘by this meane her Maiesties shippes wolde be\r\nffurnyshed with able men suche as can make shyfte for themselves, kepe\r\nthemselves clene withoute vermyne and noysomeness which bredeth sycknes\r\nand mortalletye.’[622] Moreover, ships could then carry more stores and\r\ncontinue longer at sea. Hawkyns was one of the few commanders of his age\r\nwho recognised a claim to consideration in his inferiors, and made some\r\nattempt to secure their health and comfort. In 1589 he took care to have\r\nhis stores ‘of an extraordinary price and goodnes to keep men in health’;\r\nin 1595 he took out clothes for his men and a new kind of ‘lading\r\nvictuells, a kind of victuells for sea service devised by Mr Hughe\r\nPlatte.’[623] Hammocks were introduced in 1597, when a warrant authorises\r\npayment for 300 bolts of canvas ‘to make hanging cabones or beddes ...\r\nfor the better preservation of their health.’[624] In 1590, a suggestion,\r\nwhich did not, however, take practical shape till long afterwards, was\r\nmade for the benefit of the merchant sailor. John Allington, a draper of\r\nLondon, proposed the creation of a special office for the registration\r\nof contracts between merchants, owners, and masters of ships. This would\r\nhave led to something equivalent to the present ‘signing on’ enforced by\r\nthe Board of Trade, and would have regulated the position of the seamen\r\nand simplified the enforcements of his rights, too often sacrificed to\r\nan unscrupulous use of legal forms.[625] Allington, like most of the\r\nprojectors and schemers of his day, was no philanthropist. He offered to\r\npay £40 a year for permission to establish such an office, and apparently\r\nexpected to obtain five shillings apiece from 500 or 600 ships a year.\r\n\r\nNo especial provision was made on board men-of-war for the sick or\r\nwounded sailor; if the ship went into action he was placed in the cable\r\ntier or laid upon the ballast as being the safest places. If he survived\r\nthe medical science of his time, and was landed disabled, he was supposed\r\nto be passed to his own parish. Sometimes he was permitted to beg. A\r\nprinted licence from Howard, as Lord Admiral, under date 1590, still\r\nexists empowering William Browne, maimed in 1588, to beg for a year\r\nin all churches.[626] By 35 c. 4 and 39 c. 21 of Elizabeth relief was\r\nafforded to hurt men; these were both repealed by 43 c. 3 which enacted\r\nthat parishes were to be charged with a weekly sum of not less than\r\ntwopence or more than tenpence to provide help, the pension however in no\r\ncase to exceed ten pounds for a sailor or twenty pounds for an officer.\r\nGratuities were sometimes given. In 1593 Hawkyns was ordered to pay\r\ntwo shillings a week, for twenty weeks, to 29 injured men, and William\r\nStorey, having lost a leg, received £1, 13s 4d, apparently in settlement\r\nof all claims.[627]\r\n\r\nSuch gifts, in view of the number we can still trace, were probably\r\nmore frequent than would be expected from the character of Elizabeth.\r\nIn 1587 a month’s extra pay was awarded to the crews of three pinnaces\r\nfor their good service in capturing Spanish prizes. For 1588 £5, was\r\ndivided among 100 men who manned the fireships sent into Calais Roads,\r\n£80, among the wounded of the fleet generally, and £7 to sick men in\r\nthe _Elizabeth_.[628] In 1591 six months’ pay was given to the widows\r\nof the men killed in the _Revenge_, and in 1594 there is a gift of £61,\r\n19s 6d to Helen Armourer, widow of John Armourer of Newcastle, ‘in\r\nconsideration of his good and faithful services,’ although the name is\r\nquite strange in naval affairs.[629] Merchant seamen were also remembered\r\nin these benefactions. On one occasion forty marks were paid to five\r\nmen ‘having been lately lamentably afflicted in Naples by pryson and\r\nother punyshments by thinquisition of Spayne as we are informed and by\r\nsecret escape savid their lyves.’[630] On another ‘in consideration\r\nof the valiantnes done in Turkey by our welbeloved subiecte John Ffoxe\r\nof Woodbridge in our county of Suffolk, gunner by whose meanes 266\r\nChristians were released out of miserable captivity,’ an assuredly nobly\r\nearned pension of one shilling a day was conferred upon him.[631] When\r\nit cost the Queen nothing directly she was sometimes still more liberal.\r\nTo Robert Miller, a master mariner, £200, was allowed out of forfeited\r\ngoods in consideration of his services and losses at sea; George Harrison\r\nreceived £800, in the same way and for the same reasons. Sometimes\r\nseamen’s wives, whose husbands were prisoners in Spain, petitioned the\r\nCouncil for help. In one instance the merchants owning the ships were\r\nordered to assist the women; in another their landlords were directed not\r\nto press them for rent.\r\n\r\nWe can know little of the internal economy of a merchantman in those\r\ndays. The vessels were relatively as crowded, and probably as unhealthy,\r\nas men-of-war; the victualling was of the same, and at times even worse\r\nquality, seeing that the owners of merchant vessels were expected to\r\nbuy government provisions if the victualling department found itself\r\noverstocked. In 1596 there is a letter directing the Lord Mayor to\r\nforbid the city butchers to sell meat to ships until the government\r\nstores of salt beef were sold out. This is followed by an order from the\r\nCouncil to the Serjeant of the Admiralty not to allow any outward bound\r\ntrader to pass down the river unless a certificate of such purchase was\r\nproduced.[632]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mortality on Shipboard.]\r\n\r\nWe have no means of estimating the mortality from disease on board\r\nmerchant ships, but we know that in men-of-war it was very great. ‘In\r\nthe late Queen’s time many thousands did miscarry by the corruption as\r\nwell of drink as of meat,’ says a seventeenth century writer;[633] and\r\nSir Richard Hawkyns thought that, in twenty years, 10,000 men died from\r\nscorbutic affections. The length of the voyages now undertaken rendered\r\nlarger crews necessary; the accommodation was narrow and ill-ventilated,\r\nthe requirements of sanitation unknown, and the food was usually scanty\r\nand bad, so that the sailor was placed under conditions that made him\r\nfall an easy victim to disease. In Drake’s voyage of 1585-6 out of 2300\r\nmen nearly 600 died from disease. In the expedition of 1589, out of\r\n12,000 men employed, nearly one-half perished, mainly from sickness and\r\nwant of food, and every enterprise, small or great, suffered more or\r\nless largely in the same way. Usually the hope of plunder sustained the\r\nmen through all such trials, and there is only one serious case of the\r\nmutiny of a crew because of ‘the weakness and feebleness they were fallen\r\ninto through the spare and bad diet.’ But in this instance sympathy with\r\ntheir captain may have had much to do with their action.[634]\r\n\r\nThe pages of Hakluyt relate much of the suffering endured by our seamen\r\nabroad from disease and privation, but there is one historic illustration\r\nat home of the miseries borne by the men and the callousness or scanty\r\nresources of the authorities. On 10th August 1588 Howard wrote to\r\nBurghley:\r\n\r\n    ‘Sicknes and mortallitie begin wonderfullie to growe amongste\r\n    us ... the _Elizabeth_, which hath don as well as eaver anie\r\n    ship did in anie service, hath had a great infectione in her\r\n    from the beginning soe as of the 500 men which she carried out,\r\n    by the time she had bin in Plymouth three weeks or a month\r\n    there were ded of them 200 and above, soe as I was driven to\r\n    set all the rest of her men ashore, to take out the ballast and\r\n    to make fires in her of wet broom 3 or 4 daies together, and\r\n    so hoped therebie to have cleansed her of her infectione, and\r\n    thereuppon got newe men, verie tall and hable as eaver I saw\r\n    and put them into her; nowe the infectione is broken out in\r\n    greater extremitie than eaver it did before, and they die and\r\n    sicken faster than ever they did, soe as I am driven of force\r\n    to send her to Chatham ... Sir Roger Townsend of all the men\r\n    he brought out with him hath but one left alive ... it is like\r\n    enough that the like infectione will growe throughout the most\r\n    part of the fleet, for they have bin soe long at sea and have\r\n    so little shift of apparell ... and no money wherewith to buy\r\n    it.’\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd August he writes to the Queen that the infection is bad,\r\nthat men sicken one day and die the next but, in courtly phrase, that\r\n‘I doubt not that with good care and God’s goodnes which doth ever bles\r\nyour Maiestie it wyll quenche againe.’ But on the same day he tells\r\nthe Council more plainly, ‘the most part of the fleet is grievouslie\r\ninfected and die dailie ... and the ships themselves be so infectious\r\nand so corrupted as it is thought to be a verie plague ... manie of\r\nthe ships have hardly men enough to waie their anchors.’[635] And as\r\nillustrating the infection and its probable cause comes a complaint from\r\nhim to Walsingham that, although the beer in the fleet has been condemned\r\nas unfit for use, it is still served out to the men, and ‘nothing doth\r\ndisplease the seamen more than sour beer.’\r\n\r\nThis sickness is usually said to have been the plague or typhus. But\r\nHoward and his captains, who had lived to middle age in a country where\r\nthe plague was endemic and who must have known its symptoms well,\r\nobviously thought ‘the infectione’ something different. In the passage\r\nquoted above he compares it to the plague and in another letter he\r\nwrites, ‘The mariners who have a conceit (and I think it true and so\r\ndo all the captains here) that sour drink hath been a great cause of\r\nthis infection amongst us.’[636] The plague was familiar to them all but\r\nthis was something they could not easily name. The same arguments apply,\r\nalthough perhaps not so closely, against typhus which in its general\r\nform and symptoms was familiar under various names to sixteenth century\r\nobservers. But 1588 was not a particularly unhealthy year on land and\r\nthere is no record of any sudden outbreak of epidemic disease either\r\nbefore or after that occurring on the fleet. Moreover though typhus\r\noccasionally kills within a few hours it has never been known to kill\r\nnumbers in the rapid fashion suggested by Howard. It is probable that the\r\ncomplaint was an acute enteritis, caused by the beer, acting on frames\r\nenfeebled by bad and insufficient food, and still further weakened by the\r\nscorbutic taint to which all classes, but especially seamen, were subject\r\nin the middle ages.\r\n\r\nOn the whole the position of the sailor was now steadily deteriorating.\r\nIn the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries his pay had been relatively\r\nvery high, and as he was only called upon to serve round the coasts, or,\r\nat furthest, to Bordeaux or the Baltic, his health was not affected by\r\nconditions to which he was only exposed for a short time. But towards the\r\nend of the sixteenth century the wages, in consequence of the general\r\nrise in prices, were relatively less than they had been, and less than\r\nthose of the artisan classes on shore. In an epoch when the increase in\r\nthe number of distant voyages set his services in commercial demand he\r\nwas required to serve in the royal fleets for longer periods than had\r\nbeen before known. He was exposed to a merciless system of impressment,\r\ncheap for the State because he had to indirectly bear the cost. And\r\nthe length of the cruises, their extension into tropical climates, and\r\nthe character of the provisions, unsuited to the new conditions, made\r\nthemselves felt in outbreaks of disease to which his ancestors, assembled\r\nchiefly for Channel work, had been strangers. Morally the general tone\r\namong the men cannot have been high if we may judge them from a phrase\r\nused by the officials sent down to examine into the plunder of the _Madre\r\nde Dios_ in 1592, ‘we hold it loste labor and offence to God to minister\r\noathes unto the generallitie of them.’[637]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Seamen’s Clothing.]\r\n\r\nIt will have been noticed that in his letter of 10th August Howard says\r\nthat the men have no money wherewith to buy clothes; in another he\r\nsuggests that a thousand marks’ worth of apparel should be sent down.\r\nBut the custom of providing crews with coats or jackets at the expense\r\nof the crown had quite ceased, and even if necessaries were supplied\r\nto the men they had to pay for them. The supply was usually a private\r\nspeculation on the part of some Admiralty official. In 1586 Roger\r\nLangford, afterwards paymaster of the Navy furnished men with canvas\r\ncaps, shirts, shoes, etc., a piece of business by which he lost £140. In\r\n1580 the government sent over clothes for the men on the Irish station,\r\nthe cost of which was to be deducted from their wages. The articles\r\nincluded, ‘canvas for breches and dublettes’—‘coutten for lyninges, and\r\npetticoates,’ stockings, caps, shoes, and shirts.[638] Hawkyns with the\r\nforethought always characterising his action as an admiral, took out with\r\nhim in 1595 ‘calico for 200 suits of apparel,’ 400 shirts, woollen and\r\nworsted hose, linen breeches and Monmouth caps.[639] There is a sketch in\r\na contemporary treatise on navigation of a seaman, apparently an officer.\r\nHe wears a Monmouth, or small Tam o’ Shanter, cap, a small ruff round\r\nthe neck, a close-fitting vest, and long bell-mouthed trousers.[640] In\r\n1602 there is a payment in the Navy accounts of £54, 19s 8d for clothing\r\nfor Spanish prisoners. Canvas shirts, cotton waistcoats, caps, hose, and\r\n‘rugge’ for gowns were provided and the articles were doubtless of the\r\nsame kind and quality as those worn by the men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Royal Ships Lent.]\r\n\r\nDuring the earlier years of her reign the Queen, like her predecessors,\r\nfrequently allowed her ships to be hired for trading voyages. In\r\n1561 the _Minion_, _Primrose_, _Brigandine_ and _Fleur de Lys_, were\r\ndelivered to Sir William Chester and others for a voyage to Africa. In\r\nthis case Elizabeth shared the risk. For her ships, and for provisions\r\nto the value of £500, she was to receive one-third of the profits. The\r\nhirers undertook to ship at least £5000 of goods, pay wages and all\r\nother expenses, and each enter into a bond of 1000 marks to carry out\r\nthe conditions.[641] In 1563 the _Jesus of Lubeck_ was lent to Dudley\r\nand others, to trade to Guinea and the West Indies, for which they paid\r\n£500.[642] She was then, after having been in the Royal Navy nearly\r\ntwenty years, valued at £2000 for which amounts the hirers had to give\r\ntheir bonds. She returned in 1565, was at Padstow in October, and ‘cannot\r\nbe brought to Gillingham till spring of next year.’ The adventurers\r\ncould not have procured a 600 ton vessel, for two years, for £500 from\r\nany owner but the State. And as she had to remain at Padstow during the\r\nwhole winter it may be inferred that she returned in a very unseaworthy\r\ncondition, for Elizabethan seamanship was certainly equal to taking a\r\nship up Channel during the winter months. She was hired by Hawkyns in\r\n1568 and was then the first of the only two men-of-war lost to Spain\r\nduring the entire reign. When a convoy was furnished a full charge was\r\nlevied for the protection; £558 was received in 1569 from the Merchant\r\nAdventurers’ Company for men-of-war serving on this duty, and again £586\r\nin 1570.[643] As private owners built more and bigger ships the demand\r\nfor men-of-war for trading voyages grew less, but the Queen often lent\r\nthem for privateering ventures in which she was pecuniarily interested,\r\nassessing their estimated value as a portion of the money advanced by her\r\nand on which she would receive a dividend. Under these circumstances her\r\nrepresentatives did not err on the side of moderation when valuing the\r\nships thus temporarily lent. When Drake took the _Bonaventure_ and the\r\n_Aid_ in 1585 they were appraised at £10,000, an obviously extravagant\r\nestimate. Nominally Elizabeth advanced £20,000, of which these two ships\r\nstood for half; she got her ships back, £2000 for the use of them, and\r\nthe same dividend on £20,000 as the other persons who had taken shares.\r\nThose others lost five shillings in the pound; she must have made a\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Victualling Department.]\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the greater activity of the Royal Navy the victualling\r\ndepartment experienced a corresponding enlargement. In 1560 the buildings\r\nat Tower Hill, formerly the Abbey of Grace, and granted in 1542 to Sir\r\nArthur Darcy, were purchased from him for £1200, and £700 expended in\r\nrepairing them.[644] Other storehouses were hired at Ratcliff and St\r\nKatherines, the latter from Anthony Anthony, Surveyor of the Ordnance,\r\nwho seems to have taken great interest in naval matters, and to whom we\r\nare indebted for the coloured drawings of ships previously referred to.\r\nFor his storehouse he was paid £16 a year; another at Rochester cost £5,\r\n6s 8d a year. By a patent of 24th December 1560, William Holstock was\r\njoined with Baeshe as Surveyor of the Victuals; this was surrendered and\r\nreplaced by another of 30th October, 1563 in which John Elliott took\r\nHolstock’s place. Neither Holstock nor Elliott had any actual position,\r\nthe new patents only giving them the chance of succeeding Baeshe. An\r\nagreement with him of 13th April 1565, but which did not cancel the title\r\nand fees granted to him by his Letters Patent, instituted a considerable\r\nreform inasmuch as it did away with purveyance, or forced purchase, at\r\nrates fixed by the officers of the crown. Henceforth Baeshe was to be\r\npaid fourpence halfpenny a day for each man in harbour and fivepence a\r\nday at sea. For this he was to provide, per head, on Sundays, Mondays,\r\nTuesdays and Thursdays, 1 lb of biscuit and 1 gallon of beer, and 2 lbs\r\nof salt beef, and on the other three days, besides the biscuit and beer,\r\na quarter of a stockfish,[645] one-eighth of a pound of butter, and one\r\nquarter of a pound of cheese. Fourpence a man per month at sea, and\r\neightpence in harbour he was to allow for purser’s necessaries, such as\r\nwood, candles, etc., and he was to pay the rent of all hired storehouses\r\nand the wages of his clerks. He undertook not to use the right of\r\npurveyance unless ordered to victual more than 2000 men suddenly, and\r\nagreed to always keep in hand one months provisions for 1000 men. The\r\nagreement could be terminated by six months’ notice on either side, and\r\nuntil it ceased the crown advanced him £500 without interest to be repaid\r\nwithin six months of the cessation of his contract. He was given the use\r\nof all the crown buildings belonging to his department, subject to his\r\nkeeping them in repair, and was permitted to export 1000 hides in peace\r\ntime and as many as he should slaughter oxen during war.[646] The weight\r\nof purveyance was felt chiefly in the home counties, and Elizabeth may\r\nhave felt it good policy to do away with a ceaseless source of popular\r\nirritation which was really of very little advantage to the crown.\r\nFrom this date payments were made to Baeshe direct from the Exchequer\r\nand no longer through the Navy Treasurer. Isolated payments relating\r\nto storehouses, of no general interest, recur in the accounts, but the\r\ngrowing importance of Chatham is shown by the removal, in 1570, of\r\nbuildings at Dover, and their re-erection at Rochester, at a cost of £300.\r\n\r\nIn 1569 an additional £1000 was advanced to Baeshe without interest, and\r\nin 1573, the harbour rate was raised to fivepence halfpenny per man,\r\nand the sea rate to sixpence. All this assistance, for probably further\r\nsums were lent to him without interest, does not seem to have enabled\r\nhim to carry on his work without loss. In 1576 he petitioned the Queen\r\nto be forgiven the first £500 advanced to him and to be permitted to pay\r\noff the balance at £1000 a year. He based his claim to consideration on\r\nthe fact that he had saved her 1000 marks a year by his contract and\r\nhad acted without recourse to purveyance, ‘no small benefit to the hole\r\nrealme.’ He had lost £500 a year, for four years, by the embargo on trade\r\nwith the Low Countries, which prevented his exportation of hides, and £\r\n240 by the fire at Portsmouth. And:—\r\n\r\n    ‘finally what my service hath bin from tyme to tyme as well to\r\n    her most noble ffather, brother, and sister, as to her Maiestie\r\n    I do referre the same to the report of my Lord Tresorer and\r\n    my Lord Admirall and yet hitherto I never receyved from her\r\n    Maiestie any reward for service but only her Maiesties gracious\r\n    good countenance to my comfort.’[647]\r\n\r\nThe petition does not appear to have obtained anything beyond a\r\ncontinuance of these unsubstantial favours, but Baeshe struggled on till\r\n6th May 1586 when he gave six months’ notice to determine his contract.\r\nHe then anticipated a loss of £534 on victualling eight or ten ships,\r\n‘which I am not able to beare.’[648] He must have been a very old man\r\nand anxiety perhaps hastened his death, which occurred in April 1587. In\r\nthe interval, however, the rate had been raised, from 1st November 1586\r\nto 31st March 1587 to sixpence a day per man in harbour, and sixpence\r\nhalfpenny at sea, and from 1st April 1587 to 31st October to sixpence\r\nhalfpenny in harbour and sevenpence at sea, ‘on account of the great\r\ndearth.’ The Armada was already expected, but on 30th June 1587, when\r\nthe stores were handed over to Baeshe’s successor there were only 6020\r\npieces[649] of beef, and 2300 stockfish in hand.\r\n\r\nBy Letters Patent of 27th November 1582 James Quarles ‘one of the\r\nofficers of our household’[650] had been granted survivorship to Baeshe,\r\nand he now took his place from 1st July 1587, at the same fees and\r\nallowances as had been originally given by the patent of 18th June 1550.\r\nThe rate was maintained at sixpence halfpenny and sevenpence ‘untill it\r\nshall please Almightie God to send such plentie as the heigh prises and\r\nrates of victuall shalbe diminished’. The quantity and quality of the\r\nfood provided for the men in 1588 has long been a source of disgrace to\r\nElizabeth and her ministers. An apology for them has been attempted on\r\nthe ground that the mechanism at work was new and not capable of dealing\r\nwith large numbers of men, and that the failure was mainly due to the\r\nsuddenness of the demand. So far as the first statement is concerned it\r\nis sufficient to answer that the victualling branch had been organised\r\nfor nearly forty years, and found no difficulty in arranging for 13,000\r\nmen in 1596, and 9200 men in 1597 after timely notice. The last reason\r\nmay excuse the victualling department but will not relieve the statesman\r\nin responsible direction. The government had had long notice of the\r\ncoming of the Armada, but even as late as March Burghley was occupied\r\nwith niggling attempts at making 26 days’ victuals last for 28 days.[651]\r\nIn 1565 Baeshe had undertaken to keep always one month’s victuals for\r\n1000 men in store, but in June 1587 there was not even so much. The\r\npoint therefore is that if the ministry had thus early recognised the\r\nnecessity for a reserve, and that two or three months were requisite\r\nfor the collection and preparation of provisions for a large force, and\r\nif with the knowledge that such provisions were certain to be required,\r\nand in spite of the warnings of those best able to judge, they neglected\r\nthe preparations and continued a supply which was merely from hand to\r\nmouth, they must be held guilty of the sufferings inflicted on the men\r\nby their miserable policy. When the moment of trial came Quarles and his\r\nsuperiors did their best, but the accusation against the latter is that\r\nhad they exercised the foresight supposed to be one of the qualifications\r\nfor their dignified posts no such sudden and almost ineffective efforts\r\nwould have been necessary. The spirit in which they or the Queen dealt\r\nwith the matter is shown by the necessity Howard was under of paying out\r\nof his own pocket for the extra comforts obtained for the dying seamen at\r\nPlymouth.[652]\r\n\r\nHow far Elizabeth was herself answerable is a moot point. There is no\r\ndirect evidence that the delay in obtaining provisions was due to her\r\norders. On the other hand we know that the postponements in equipping\r\nthe ships, and the hesitating action and inconsistent directions and\r\nsuggestions that characterised the early months of 1588, were due to her,\r\nand there is a strong probability that much of the shame should rest with\r\nher rather than with ministers who perhaps had to carry out commands to\r\nwhich they had objected in Council. Moreover very few things, especially\r\nthose involving expense, were done without the knowledge and approval of\r\nElizabeth. It was a personal government and there is no reason to suppose\r\nthat this particular branch was beyond her cognisance. With the fatality\r\nthat has usually dogged English militant endeavour the fleet did not even\r\nobtain the benefit, at the right time, of the stores provided. Frequently\r\nvictuallers were blundering about for weeks looking for it, while the\r\nadmirals were sending up despairing entreaties for supplies. In April,\r\nDrake wrote to the Queen ‘I have not in my lifetime known better men and\r\npossessed with gallanter minds than your Majesty’s people are for the\r\nmost part.’ Whether the cause was incompetence or a criminal parsimony\r\ntheir fate, after having saved their country, was to perish in misery,\r\nunheeded and unhelped except by the officers who had fought with them. In\r\nthe conceit of Elizabeth and her like they were only ‘the common sort.’\r\n\r\nDuring the forty years that Baeshe had served the crown he had never been\r\ncharged with dishonesty and he died poor. Quarles however had at once\r\nserious malpractices imputed to him as having occurred within his first\r\nyear of office.[653] His accuser, a subordinate, as usual offered to do\r\nhis work for 1000 marks a year less, and on examination of the charges it\r\nseems likely that some were untrue and that other defaults occurred in\r\nconsequence of the orders given to him.\r\n\r\nFrom 1589 the rate again fell to fivepence-halfpenny and sixpence, in\r\nharbour and at sea; but for 1590 and 1591 Quarles was allowed £2355, on\r\naccount of the dearth still existing. He had petitioned that he had\r\nsuffered a loss of £3172, between April 1590 and April 1591, being the\r\ndifference between the rates paid to him and the cost per head of the\r\nvictuals.[654] He died in 1595 and was succeeded by Marmaduke Darell, his\r\ncoadjutor, ‘clerk of our averie.’[655] Till 1600 the rate remained the\r\nsame although heavy extra allowances were made each year to Darell; then\r\nit was raised to sixpence halfpenny and sevenpence. In this year £738\r\nwas spent on repairs to Tower Hill where there were separate houses for\r\nbeef, bacon, ling, etc., ‘the great mansion being the officers lodgings.’\r\nThe storehouses and brewhouses at Portsmouth, built by Henry VIII, still\r\nexisted under the names originally given them and were repaired at a cost\r\nof £234.\r\n\r\nOne ton and a half of gross tonnage, or one of stowage, was allowed on\r\nboard ship, for one month’s provisions for four men, of which the beer\r\noccupied half, wood and water a quarter, and solid food the remainder of\r\na ton.[656] There is no reason to suppose that either Baeshe, Quarles, or\r\nDarell were either dishonest or incompetent. The terrible outbreaks of\r\ndisease that occurred during nearly every long voyage were not confined\r\nto the English service and were the natural result of salt meat and fish,\r\nand beer that could not be prevented from turning sour. They could only\r\ndo their best with the materials at command but which were not suitable\r\nto the larger field in which the services of English sailors were now\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Administration.]\r\n\r\nBenjamin Gonson was Treasurer of the Navy when Elizabeth came to\r\nthe throne and held the post until his death in 1577. The number of\r\nvessels added to the Navy during his term of office shows that he was\r\nnot inactive, and he was certainly a competent public servant. John\r\nHawkyns[657] was his son-in-law, and the relationship doubtless inspired\r\nHawkyns with the hope of succeeding him, and perhaps enabled him to\r\ninfuse some of his own spirit into the management of the Navy, while\r\nGonson was still its official head. But mere relationship, although it\r\nhad its influence would not alone have sufficed, had not Hawkyns already\r\nmade his name as a seaman and as an able commander. In 1567 he received\r\na grant of the reversion to the office of Clerk of the Ships, a post\r\nhe could only have looked upon as a stepping-stone, and which he never\r\ntook up. In 1577, when Gonson was ill, Hawkyns petitioned the Queen,\r\nprobably, although it is not specifically mentioned, for the reversion to\r\nhis post, and drew up a long catalogue of unrecompensed services.[658]\r\nGonson died in the course of a year, a landed proprietor in Essex, and\r\na successful man, but he had told his son-in-law, when the latter was\r\ntrying to obtain the reversion, that, ‘I shall pluck a thorn out of my\r\nfoot and put it into yours.’ Hawkyns lived to realise the truth of the\r\nkindly warning. He commenced his duties from 1st January 1577-8, acting\r\nunder Letters Patent of 18th November 1577, by which he was granted the\r\nsurvivorship to Gonson. For seventeen years, during the most critical\r\nperiod of English history, he was, in real fact, solely responsible for\r\nthe efficiency of the Navy, and he, more than any other man may be said\r\nto have ‘organised victory’ for the English fleets. His duties included\r\nnot only the superintendence of the work at the dockyards, but that of\r\nbuilding, equipping, and repairing the ships, of keeping them safely\r\nmoored and in good order, of the supply of good and sufficient stores,\r\nand apparently of every administrative detail except those connected with\r\nthe ordnance, and of victualling and pressing the men. The technical\r\nimprovements he himself invented or introduced have already been noticed.\r\nIn the administration he made others, which may or may not have been\r\nadvantageous, but which touched the interests of subordinates, and which\r\nresulted in his having to stand alone and carry on his work impeded by\r\nthe sullen enmity of his colleagues and his inferiors.\r\n\r\nHawkyns owed his knighthood to Howard rather than the Queen; his reward\r\nafter 1588 was to be allowed a year wherein to unravel his intricate\r\naccounts. In fact few of Elizabeth’s officials escaped her left-handed\r\ngraces. Baeshe died in poverty after forty years of honest service, and\r\nHawkyns was continually struggling to clear himself from suspicions\r\nthat were kept hanging over him, but from which he was given no proper\r\nopportunity to free himself. Elizabeth’s favours and bounties were\r\nreserved for court gallants of smoother fibre than were these men. In\r\n1594, shortly before his last unhappy voyage, Hawkyns founded a hospital\r\nat Chatham for ten poor mariners and shipwrights. He, with Drake,\r\nestablished the ‘Chatham Chest,’ for disabled seamen, and it should be\r\nremembered to his honour that, in an age when little care was bestowed on\r\ninferiors if they had ceased to be of any utility, he never relaxed his\r\nefforts until his craft had rescued from Spanish prisons the survivors\r\nof those under his command in 1568 whom he had been compelled to leave\r\nashore after escaping from San Juan de Ulloa.\r\n\r\nCharges of peculation against persons connected with maritime affairs\r\nwere rife on all sides. The shipwrights quarrelled among themselves and\r\nwith Hawkyns, and two of the former, Chapman and Pett, were moreover\r\naccused by outsiders of gross overcharges.[659] Captains were said to\r\ndismiss pressed men for bribes, to retain wages, and keep back arms;[660]\r\npursers to steal provisions, to make false entries by which they obtained\r\npayments for money never advanced to the men, and to remain ashore while\r\ntheir ships were at sea.[661] Pursers, cooks, and boatswains, bought\r\ntheir places: the cooks had the victuals in their care and recouped\r\nthemselves at the expense of the seamen; boatswains stripped a ship of\r\nmovable fittings, on her return home, and stole rigging and cordage.[662]\r\nAccording to the evidence of a witness, in the inquiry of 1608, these\r\nabuses, if they did not commence, took fresh and vigorous life after\r\nthe death of Hawkyns. In 1587 he recognised the theft going on and his\r\ninability to completely suppress it; ‘I thincke it wolde be mete their\r\nweare a provost marshyall attendante upon ye Lord Admirall and Offycers\r\nof the Navye to doe suche present execucyon aboorde the shippes uppon\r\nthe offenders as shulde be apoynted.’[663] Accusations were not wanting\r\nduring Gonson’s lifetime but the increased activity of the Navy after\r\nhis death gave a wider scope both to suspicion and to actual peculation.\r\nHawkyns was not the only one of the Principal Officers whose conduct was\r\nimpeached, but in virtue of his position the brunt of attack fell upon\r\nhim. There was hardly one of his duties which at some time or another did\r\nnot give occasion for a charge of dishonesty.[664]\r\n\r\nHawkyns, if we may judge by the letters remaining in the Record Office,\r\nwas more frequently in communication with Burghley, explaining his\r\nintentions and desires, than with his official chief the Lord Admiral.\r\nEither therefore Burghley was satisfied with his conduct—and there is one\r\nletter that directly supports this view—or the Lord Treasurer allowed a\r\nman whose honesty he doubted to remain in a responsible office without\r\nremoving him, or adopting any new measure of supervision. The quality of\r\nthe cordage had been a common cause of complaint and, in 1579, Hawkyns\r\nwrote that he had taken measures, of which he doubted not the success,\r\nto remedy this and other evils, and that he had a memorandum ready\r\nproposing a course to be followed, ‘wherebye the offyce wolld not onelye\r\nflourysshe but within a few yers be bountyfullye provyded of all maner\r\nof provycion without extra charge to her Maiestie.’[665] Subsequent\r\nevents show that the suggestions he was here about to make were accepted\r\nand, as a consequence of his new methods, the clamour raised against\r\nhim grew so loud that in January 1583-4 a commission sat to inquire\r\ninto the condition of the ships and the conduct of the office. Nothing\r\nis known of their report but it was evidently not of a character fatal\r\nto his reputation. In another letter to Burghley shortly afterwards he\r\nattributes his success in carrying out reforms to the aid he had received\r\nfrom the minister’s skill,\r\n\r\n    ‘in the passinge of theis greate thinges thadversaries of the\r\n    worke have contynewallye opposyd themselves against me ... and\r\n    their slawnders hathe gone verye farr ... onlye to be avenged\r\n    of me and this servis which doth discover the corruption and\r\n    ignoraunce of the tyme past.’[666]\r\n\r\nBy 1587 he had begun to share Gonson’s weary disgust of his surroundings,\r\nand intimated that the work was too much for any one man and should be\r\ndone by a commission. Howard’s high opinion of him was expressed freely\r\nin his letters during 1588, and shown practically by the knighthood he\r\nconferred. Notwithstanding his services, so fully tested in that year,\r\nhe does not appear to have won the shy confidence of Elizabeth, but that\r\nhe had succeeded in convincing Burghley is I think clearly proved by the\r\nfollowing letter:—[667]\r\n\r\n    ‘My bownden dewtie in humble manner rememberyd unto your good\r\n    lordshipe; I do perseve hir Maiestie ys not well sattysfied\r\n    concernyng the imploymentes of the great somes of mony that\r\n    have byne reseaved into thoffice of the navye although your\r\n    Honour dyd very honourably bothe take payne and care to se\r\n    the strycte and orderly course that ys used in thoffice and\r\n    thereupon delyver your mynd playnely to her Maiestie as your\r\n    lordship found yt for which I shall ever acknowlege myself\r\n    dewtyfully bownd to honour and serve your lordshipp to the\r\n    uttermost of my abillytie: and whereas her Highnes pleasure ys\r\n    to be farther sattysfied in myne accomptes ther hathe nothyng\r\n    byne more desyred nor cold be more wellcome or acceptible to\r\n    me and when yt shalbe hir Maiesties pleasure to nomynate the\r\n    persons that I shall attend upon I wyll brieffly shew the\r\n    state of every yeres accompt suffycyently avouched by boockes\r\n    to the last day of Desember 1588 which is XI yeres....

He had convinced Howard and\r\nBurghley, of whom the first was a seaman who had proved his work by the\r\ntests of war and storm, and the second no guileless innocent, but a\r\npolitician grown grey among surroundings of fraud and intrigue. Only the\r\npenetrating Elizabeth refused to be deceived.\r\n\r\nIn 1592 and 1594 he again expressed his wish to resign, but the\r\ngovernment had apparently no desire to lose his services.[669] On\r\nClynton’s decease Charles, Lord Howard of Effingham became Lord\r\nAdmiral,[670] and held the office till 1618. His name is indissolubly\r\nconnected with the maritime glories his support of Hawkyns and his clear\r\njudgment as a commander helped to bring about. Howard was the first Lord\r\nAdmiral who transferred some of the privileges of his office. In 1594\r\nhe gave over to the Trinity House the management of buoys and beacons\r\nalong the coasts and the rights of ballasting in the Thames.[671] This\r\nmarks the first practical connection the Corporation had with maritime\r\naffairs. Hawkyns died at sea on 12th November 1595, and the Treasurership\r\nwas not immediately filled up. Roger Langford, long an office assistant,\r\nand his deputy during his absence, was made ‘General Paymaster of the\r\nMarine Causes,’ but simply worked at the accounts without authority in\r\nadministrative business.[672] In 1598 Fulke Grevill, afterwards Lord\r\nBrooke, was appointed Treasurer with full powers.[673] Grevill is said,\r\nby a modern writer, to have possessed ‘a dignified indolence of temper,’\r\nand ‘a refinement in morality which rendered him unfit for the common\r\npursuits of mankind.’ These were not qualifications peculiarly fitting\r\nhim for the rough surroundings of naval affairs in 1598 and the real\r\ncontrol passed into the hands of his colleagues.\r\n\r\nTill his death in 1589 Sir Wm. Wynter, from 1557 Surveyor of the Ships\r\nand Master of the Ordnance of the Navy, was, after Hawkyns, the most\r\ninfluential officer. He was succeeded by Sir H. Palmer,[674] who held the\r\npost until he became Comptroller in 1598,[675] when he was replaced as\r\nSurveyor by John Trevor.[676] After Wynter’s death there was no longer\r\na separate ordnance department for the Navy. Richard Howlet, the former\r\nClerk of the Ships, died in 1560, and George Wynter, a brother of Sir\r\nWilliam Wynter was appointed.[677] In 1580 George Wynter was succeeded by\r\nWilliam Borough,[678] who, in 1588 was followed by Benjamin Gonson, son\r\nof the former Treasurer,[679] who, in turn, was succeeded by Peter Buck\r\nin 1600. William Holstock became Comptroller from 12th December 1561, in\r\nsuccession to Brooke, and in 1589 William Borough succeeded him until\r\n1598. Nearly all these men commanded ships or squadrons at sea at various\r\ntimes, in addition to their duties as members of the naval board. There\r\nis a draft document existing[680] which shows that in January 1564 it was\r\nintended to add another officer as ‘Chief Pilot of England,’ on the model\r\nof the ‘Pilot Major’ of Spain. Stephen Borough was the person chosen, and\r\nin consequence of the losses of shipping through the ignorance of pilots\r\nand masters no one was to act in such a capacity in vessels of forty\r\ntons and upwards, without a certificate of competence from him, under a\r\npenalty of two pounds. Masters’ mates, boatswains, and quartermasters\r\nwere to be similarly examined and certified. This plan, however, was not\r\ncarried into execution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dockyards.]\r\n\r\nConcerning the dockyards the most noteworthy feature is: the rise into\r\nimportance of the Chatham yard. For 1563 the expenses of Deptford were\r\n£19,700, while those of Gillingham, chiefly for the wages and victuals\r\nof shipkeepers, were £3700. In 1567 it is first called Chatham, a house\r\nrented for the use of the Board, and the cost of Chatham and Gillingham\r\n£6300. Next year the ground on which Upnor Castle was to be built was\r\nbought for £25,[681] and in 1574 a fort was ordered for Sheerness which\r\nreplaced the bulwark built in the reign of Edward VI. In 1571 more\r\nground was rented at Chatham, and in 1574 the fairway through St Mary’s\r\nCreek, by which the anchorage could be taken in flank, was blocked by\r\npiles.[682] Deptford, however, was still in considerable use, especially\r\nfor building and repairs of ships, and in the same year the dock was\r\nreconstructed. In 1578 a new pair of gates for the Deptford dock cost\r\n£150, and in the following year most, if not all, of the dockyards\r\nwere fenced round with hedges.[683] Small additions in the shape of\r\nwharves and storehouses, were being continually made to Chatham; one\r\nof the former, built in 1580, was 378 feet Long, 40 feet broad, and\r\ncost five shillings a foot. Various other improvements of the same kind\r\nwere carried out in connection with Woolwich and Deptford, and as no\r\ndrydock was constructed at Chatham during this reign, all the building\r\nand repairs of the big ships was done at the former places. Portsmouth\r\nwas hardly used at all. In 1586 a new wharf was made, and sundry small\r\nexpenses were at various times incurred for keeping the dock in order,\r\nbut sometimes for years in succession the only expenses relating to it\r\nare the salaries of the officers in charge. The yard was nearly destroyed\r\nby a fire on 4th August 1576, and was probably not fully restored.\r\nIt was, moreover, contemned by the chief officers, who considered it\r\nexpensive and defenceless.[684] For a few years, from 1601, the Hansa\r\nsteelyard was handed over to the Admiralty and used for storage purposes.\r\n\r\nIn early times the Bridport district had supplied most of the cordage\r\nused in the English service; in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries\r\nit had mostly come from abroad. In 1573 there was an attempt to secure\r\nindependence in this respect, and £800 which he was to repay by £100 a\r\nyear, was advanced to Thomas Allen to build ropehouses at Woolwich.[685]\r\nAllen was ‘Queen’s merchant,’ _i.e._, crown purchaser, for Dantzic\r\ncordage. The experiment was probably a failure, since there is no other\r\nreference to it, and was not renewed until the next reign.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the forts at Upnor and Sheerness the ships lying in the\r\nMedway required some further protection, as relations with Spain became\r\nmore critical and rumours of plots to fire the vessels frequent. This\r\nwas given by means of a chain, an old and well known form of defence. In\r\na letter to Burghley, of March 1585, Hawkyns suggested the chain with\r\ntwo or four pinnaces stationed by it, and the _Scout_ and _Achates_ at\r\nSheerness to search everything passing.[686] In October the work was\r\nnearly completed; it had been ‘tedyous and cumbersome but now stretched\r\nover the river in good order yt dothe requyre many lyghters for the\r\nbearynge of it which are in hand.’[687] One end was fixed to piles, the\r\nother worked round ‘two great wheels to draw it up;’ it was supported by\r\nfive lighters, and pinnaces were stationed at each shore end. The Council\r\nordered, as well, that whereas Her Majesty was ‘advertysed that some\r\npractyce and devyce ys taken in hande to bourne and destroye the navye,’\r\nthe principal officers were to sleep on board at the anchorage in turn,\r\nfor a month at the time, and see that the shipkeepers did their duty.\r\n\r\nThe Elizabethan drawing of the Medway and surrounding district, partly\r\nreproduced in this volume, does not show the chain at Upnor and is\r\nprobably therefore of a date between 1568-85. It is seen that the ships\r\nare moored athwart stream in three groups, from Upnor towards Rochester,\r\nthe larger ones being at Upnor. They must have been moored across\r\nstream from considerations of space; and the accuracy of the placing is\r\ncorroborated by a much later drawing of 1702 which shows vessels in the\r\nsame position, and by the fact that we know from other sources that the\r\nfirst-rates were nearest Upnor. These latter carried lights at night[688]\r\nand the whole were in the especial charge of the principal masters of\r\nthe Navy of whom, after 1588, there were six and who were allowed three\r\nshillings a week for their victualling. The first sign of the dockyard is\r\npossibly shown between Chatham Church and St Mary’s creek. The vessels\r\nare shown dismantled as would have been actually the case.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shipwrights.]\r\n\r\nIn 1559 shipwrights’ wages were from eightpence to a shilling, and in\r\n1588 from a shilling to seventeenpence a day; they were also provided\r\nwith free lodging, or lodging money at the rate of a shilling a week,\r\nwith three meals a day and as much beer ‘as shall suffice them,’ and,\r\nbetween 25th March and 8th September, an afternoon snack of bread,\r\ncheese, and beer.[689] From 1st November to 2nd February, they worked\r\nfrom daylight till dark; for the rest of the year from five o’clock,\r\nin the morning till 7 at night, and, on Saturdays till 6 o’clock. They\r\nwere allowed one hour at noon, and work was started and stopped by bell;\r\nanyone ringing it except by order of the master shipwright was fined a\r\nday’s pay and put into the stocks.[690] The three principal constructors,\r\nor master shipwrights were Peter Pett, Mathew Baker, and Richard\r\nChapman. Pett died in 1589 and was succeeded by his son Joseph, and then,\r\nin 1600, by his better known younger son Phineas, who had been sent to\r\nCambridge but who did not think it unbecoming his university standing to\r\nstart in life as a carpenter’s mate on a Levant trader. Although Pett\r\nhas the greater reputation, at least one officer of the Admiralty well\r\nqualified to judge—William Borough—considered Baker his superior. John\r\nDavis, the explorer, also specially speaks of him as, ‘Mr Baker for\r\nhis skill and surpassing grounded knowledge in the building of ships\r\nadvantageable to all purpose hath not in any nation his equal.’[691]\r\nBaker became master shipwright by Letters Patent of 29th August 1572, and\r\nby virtue of the patent, received a fee of one shilling a day for life\r\nfrom the Exchequer. Peter Pett already held a similar patent, Richard\r\nChapman obtained one in 1587 and Joseph Pett in 1590. Little is known of\r\nChapman beyond the fact that from the ships he built his reputation must\r\nhave been equal to that of the others, and practically all the important\r\nbuilding of the reign was done by these three men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ships’ Officers and Pay.]\r\n\r\nThere are but few notices of the ships’ officers of this period. In all\r\nranks the majority seem to have been disposed to add to their pay by\r\nirregular methods. Some of the accusations made against them have been\r\nnoticed, and on service, whether the prize was a captured town or a small\r\nmerchantman, discipline was at an end until all, from captains downwards\r\nhad taken their fill of pillage. At sea captains obeyed or disobeyed,\r\ndeserted or remained with their admiral, without usually being afterwards\r\ncalled to account for their conduct. In only one case was a captain,\r\nWilliam Borough, tried for insubordination in 1587, and as this is the\r\nfirst instance of a court martial the proceedings are here printed in\r\nfull.[692] If Drake intended to disgrace Borough he failed, for no result\r\nfollowed, and the delinquent, two years later, became Comptroller of\r\nthe Navy. Until 1582 the old system of paying the officers the wages of\r\na ‘common man’ per month, and adding to this by a graduated proportion\r\nrepresenting the dead shares and rewards, still continued. However\r\nwhen wages were raised in that year the dead shares and rewards were\r\nabolished, except as a form of expression, and each officer had a fixed\r\nsum per month, according to the rate of his ship.[693] But sometimes\r\nthe scale of pay depended not upon the rate, but was ‘according to the\r\ngreatness of his charge,’ _i.e._, on the nature of the work for which the\r\nvessel was commissioned.[694] Wages were again raised about 1602,[695]\r\nand the two scales of payment are thrown together in the following\r\ntable:—\r\n\r\n  +------------------+---------------------+---------------------+\r\n  |                  |     First-rates     |     Second-rates    |\r\n  |                  +----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n  |                  |   1582   |   1602   |   1582   |   1602   |\r\n  |                  +----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n  |                  | £  s.  d.| £  s.  d.| £  s.  d.| £  s.  d.|\r\n  |_Master_          | 2   1   8| 3   2   6| 2   0   0| 3   0   0|\r\n  |_Master’s Mate_   | 1   1   8| 1  10   0| 0  16   8| 1   5   0|\r\n  |_Boatswain_       | 1   1   8| 1  10   0| 0  16   8| 1   5   0|\r\n  |_Boatswain’s Mate_| 0  11   8| 0  17   6| 0  11   8| 0  17   6|\r\n  |_Quartermaster_   | 0  16   8| 1   5   0| 0  11   8| 0  17   6|\r\n  |_Do.

There is nothing\r\nknown of the reasons moving the government to the relatively enormous\r\nincrease of the end of the reign, marked by a liberality contrary to the\r\ntraditions of nearly half a century. The relative pays would now, in some\r\ncases, be considered extraordinary; surgeons and trumpeters are put on\r\nthe same footing, and sixth-rates of 1602 are given the option between\r\nthem but are not allowed both. A captain’s pay varied between 2s 6d and\r\n6s 8d a day, and he was allowed two servants for every fifty men of his\r\ncrew, and if he were a knight four men. This really meant that he was\r\nlicensed to draw pay and rations, or the value in money of rations, for\r\nthe permitted number of servants whether or no they were actually on\r\nboard. In 1588 lieutenants at £3, and corporals at 17s 6d a month were\r\ncarried in some of the ships.\r\n\r\nAlthough in 1564 it had been intended to nominate a pilot major to insure\r\na knowledge of seamanship and navigation in those responsible for the\r\nsafety of ships, further experience may have brought more efficient men\r\nto the front and rendered it unnecessary. There are very few signs that\r\nsuch a step could have been requisite, judging from the accounts of the\r\nvoyages of these years. Men seem to have handled their ships skilfully in\r\nall conditions and under all difficulties, and in navigation landfalls\r\nwere made with accuracy, landmarks known and recorded, and the Channel\r\nsoundings as minutely mapped out and acted upon as now. The case was very\r\ndifferent with Spanish seamen. From 1508 there had been a great school\r\nof cosmography and navigation at Seville, under the superintendence\r\nof the Pilot Major of Spain, but it does not appear to have succeeded\r\nin turning out competent officers. The records of the Spanish voyages\r\nshow how frequently gross errors in navigation occurred, and travellers\r\ncommunicated their impressions to the same effect. One of these, writing\r\nin 1573, says,\r\n\r\n    ‘How can a wise and omnipotent God have placed such a difficult\r\n    and important art as navigation into such coarse and lubberly\r\n    hands as those of these pilots. You should see them ask one\r\n    another, “How many degrees have you got?” One says, “Sixteen,”\r\n    another “About twenty,” and another “Thirteen and a half.”\r\n    Then they will say, “What distance do you make it to the\r\n    land?” One answers, “I make it 40 leagues from land,” another\r\n    “I a hundred and fifty,” a third, “I reckoned it this morning\r\n    to be ninety-two leagues;” and whether it be three or three\r\n    hundred no one of them agrees with the other or with the actual\r\n    fact.’[696]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ordnance and Ship Armament.]\r\n\r\nIn 1558 there were ordnance wharves and storehouses, connected with the\r\nNavy at Woolwich, Portsmouth, and Porchester; Gillingham was shortly\r\nafter added to these. In her youth Elizabeth appears to have been fond\r\nof fireworks as the ordnance accounts bear £130, 4s 2d expended, between\r\n1558-64, to amuse her in that way. The report drawn up in 1559[697]\r\ntells us that there were 264 brass and 48 iron guns, of all calibres\r\ndown to falconets, on board the ships, and 48 brass and 8 iron in store.\r\nTo these could be added upwards of 1000 small pieces, whole, demi, and\r\nquarter slings, fowlers, bases, portpieces, and harquebuses.[698] Eleven\r\nthousand rounds of cannon shot, 10,600 of lead, 1500 of stone and 692\r\ncross bar shot, supplied the guns; other weapons were 3000 bows, 6300\r\nsheaves of arrows, 3100 morrispikes, and 3700 bills. The heaviest piece\r\nused on shipboard was the culverin of 4500 lbs., throwing a 17⅓ lbs.\r\nball with an extreme range of 2500 paces;[699] the next the demi cannon\r\nweighing 4000 lbs., with a 30⅓ lbs. ball and range of 1700 paces; then\r\nthe demi culverin of 3400 lbs., a 9⅓ lb. ball and 2500 paces, and the\r\ncannon petroe, or perier, of 3000 lbs. 24¼ lb. ball and 1600 paces.[700]\r\nThere were also sakers, minions, and falconets, but culverins and demi\r\nculverins were the most useful and became the favourite ship guns. The\r\nweights given differ in nearly every list found and were purely academic.\r\nA contemporary wrote, ‘the founders never cast them so exactly but that\r\nthey differ two or three cwt. in a piece,’ and in a paper of 1564 the\r\naverage weights of culverins, demi culverins, and cannon periers are\r\nrespectively 3300 lbs., 2500 lbs., and 2000 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe equipment of a first-rate like the _Triumph_ (450 seamen, 50\r\ngunners, and 200 soldiers) in small arms, was 250 harquebuses, 50 bows,\r\n100 sheaves of arrows, 200 pikes, 200 bills, 100 corselets, and 200\r\nmorions.[701] There were 750 lbs. of corn, and 4470 of serpentine,\r\npowder on board. The _Victory_ had 200 harquebuses, 40 bows, 80 sheaves\r\nof arrows, 100 pikes, 180 bills, 80 corselets, and 160 minions; she\r\ncarried 600 lbs. of corn powder, and 4347 of serpentine. Twenty-four\r\nwas the number of ships usually taken as the standard to be prepared in\r\nthe numerous estimates of the equipment necessary for fleets; in 1574\r\nthere were 45 demi cannon, 37 cannon periers, 89 culverins, 142 demi\r\nculverins, 183 sakers, 56 minions, and 66 falcons on board 24 vessels in\r\nJune of that year.[702] The first list giving the armament of the ships\r\nindividually is of 1585 and is as follows:[703]\r\n\r\n  +-------------+-------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |             |Demi Cannon                                            |\r\n  |             |    |Cannon Periers                                    |\r\n  |             |    |    |Culverins                                    |\r\n  |             |    |    |    |Demi Culverins                          |\r\n  |             |    |    |    |    |Sakers                             |\r\n  |             |    |    |    |    |    |Minions                       |\r\n  |             |    |    |    |    |    |    |Fawcons                  |\r\n  |             |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |Fawconets           |\r\n  |             |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |Portpieces     |\r\n  |             |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |Fowlers   |\r\n  |             |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |Bases|\r\n  +             +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----+\r\n  |_Elizabeth_  |  9 |  4 | 14 |  7 |  6 |  2 |  8 |    |  4 | 10 | 12  |\r\n  |_Triumph_    |  9 |  4 | 14 |  7 |  6 |  2 |    |    |  4 | 10 | 12  |\r\n  |_White Bear_ | 11 |  6 | 17 | 10 | 10 |  4 |  4 |    |  4 | 10 | 12  |\r\n  |_Victory_    |  6 |  4 | 14 |  8 |  2 |    |  4 |    |  6 | 10 | 12  |\r\n  |_Hope_       |  4 |  2 |  6 | 10 |  4 |  2 |  1 |    |  4 |  6 | 12  |\r\n  |_Mary Rose_  |  4 |  2 |  8 |  6 |  8 |    |    |    |  2 |  6 |  4  |\r\n  |_Nonpareil_  |  4 |  2 |  4 |  6 | 12 |  1 |  1 |    |  4 |  6 | 12  |\r\n  |_Lion_       |  4 |  4 |  6 |  8 |  6 |    |  2 |    |  4 |  6 | 12  |\r\n  |_Revenge_    |  2 |  4 | 10 |  6 | 10 |    |  2 |    |  2 |  4 |  6  |\r\n  |_Bonaventure_|  4 |  2 |  6 |  8 |  6 |  2 |  2 |    |  4 |  6 | 12  |\r\n  |_Dreadnought_|    |  2 |  4 | 10 |  6 |    |  2 |    |  2 |  8 |  8  |\r\n  |_Swiftsure_  |    |  2 |  4 |  8 |  8 |    |  4 |    |  2 |  6 |  8  |\r\n  |_Antelope_   |    |  2 |  2 |  6 |  6 |  2 |  2 |    |  4 |  4 | 10  |\r\n  |_Swallow_    |    |  2 |    |  4 |  8 |  2 |  6 |    |  4 |  4 | 10  |\r\n  |_Foresight_  |    |    |  4 |  8 |  8 |  4 |    |    |  2 |  2 |  8  |\r\n  |_Aid_        |    |    |    |  2 |  8 |  2 |  6 |  1 |  4 |  8 |  8  |\r\n  |_Bull_       |    |    |    |  6 |  8 |  2 |  1 |    |    |  4 |  4  |\r\n  |_Tiger_      |    |    |    |  6 | 10 |  2 |  2 |    |    |  4 |  4  |\r\n  |_Scout_      |    |    |    |    |  8 |  2 |  6 |  2 |    |  2 |  6  |\r\n  |_Achates_    |    |    |    |    |  2 |  4 | 10 |    |    |  2 |  4  |\r\n  |_Merlin_     |    |    |    |    |    |    |  6 |  2 |    |  2 |  2  |\r\n  +-------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----+\r\n\r\nThis appears to have been the existing or intended provision, ‘according\r\nto Sir William Wynters proporcion of 1569,’ The system of heavily arming\r\nships, introduced by Henry VIII, had grown in favour with the lapse of\r\ntime. From a chance allusion we know that the _Victory’s_ waist was\r\nordinarily 20 feet above the water line; she only had a lower gun-deck,\r\ntherefore, the lower tier must have been more than the four feet above\r\nthe water allowed by Ralegh.\r\n\r\nIn only one paper have we any information as to the distribution of the\r\nguns; from a schedule of October 1595, of iron ordnance to be provided\r\nfor the ‘lesser ship now building’ (probably the _Warspite_) we are able\r\nto note their arrangement and the tendency to limit the varieties in\r\nuse.[704] But it differs considerably from the armament of the _Warspite_\r\nas given in the next table.\r\n\r\n  For the sides on the lower overloppe,           12 Culverins\r\n  For the stern and prow on the lower overloppe,   4   do.\r\n  For the capstan deck on the sides,               8 Demi Culverins\r\n  For the stem and prow on the sides,              4   do.\r\n  For the waist fore and aft,                      6 Sakers\r\n  For the half deck                                2   do.\r\n\r\nThe next list drawn up two months after Elizabeth’s death, gives the\r\narmament of the whole Navy.[705] Upnor Castle possessed, in brass, 1\r\ndemi cannon, 3 culverins, 1 minion, 3 fawcons and 4 fowlers; in iron, 4\r\nculverins, 5 demi culverins and 1 saker.

there\r\nis a large decrease in cannon and a corresponding increase in culverins,\r\ndemi culverins and sakers, which strained a ship less, were served more\r\nquickly and by fewer men, and permitted a heavier broadside in the same\r\ndeck space. They were mounted on four-wheeled carriages and may have been\r\nfitted with elevating screws, the latter probably recently introduced\r\nas they are mentioned among Bourne’s _Inventions_. The length of a\r\ncannon carriage was 5½ ft., and of a demi cannon carriage 5 ft., costing\r\nrespectively £1, 3s 4d and 19s 9d.[711] A ship’s anchors and guns had her\r\nname painted on them.[712]\r\n\r\nWilliam Thomas, master gunner of the _Victory_, drew attention in 1584\r\nto the lack of trained gunners he thought he perceived, nor was he the\r\nonly person who detected the same deficiency. The Spaniards who were,\r\nunder the circumstances, perhaps better judges thought differently, and\r\none of their Armada captains relates that the English fired their heavy\r\nguns as quickly as the Spaniards did their muskets.[713] The grant of\r\nthe artillery ground by Henry VIII as a place of practice has already\r\nbeen mentioned, and, in 1575, it is again brought into notice by an order\r\nthat sufficient powder and shot should be allowed to train ‘scollers’\r\nthere.[714] Until Wynter’s death in 1589 the supply of ordnance stores\r\nfor the Navy remained under his control, and the absence of remark shows\r\nthat the business progressed smoothly. It then became a part of the\r\nordinary work of the Ordnance Office, and that department did not belie\r\nthe unsavoury reputation it has always held. By 1591 outcry against it\r\nran high, and in 1598 and 1600 its corrupt and lax administration called\r\nforth various projects of reform. The superior departmental officers\r\ngave themselves allowances and, through brokers, sold to themselves\r\nas representing the crown; the inferior clerks were in league with\r\nthe gunners in embezzlement.[715] With such encouragement it is not\r\nsurprising to find that\r\n\r\n    ‘the master gunners who do usually indent for the provision\r\n    of ships and fortified places do commonly return unreasonable\r\n    waste of all things committed to their charge, which waste\r\n    grows not by any of Her Majesty’s service but by the gunners\r\n    themselves in selling Her Majesty’s powder and shot and other\r\n    provisions, sometimes before they go to sea and most usually\r\n    upon their return from the sea.’\r\n\r\nUsually the captain shared the proceeds with the gunner and the clerks of\r\nthe Ordnance department, and the transaction leaves no mark. Occasionally\r\na captain refused and then we have the incident put on record as in the\r\ncase of the master gunner of the _Defiance_, who, when she returned from\r\nsea in 1596 offered his commander £100 for permission to steal half the\r\npowder remaining on board.[716] The patentee for iron shot was a prisoner\r\nfor debt and forced to sublet his contract; sometimes he bought shot sold\r\nby the gunners, ‘so that Her Majesty buyeth her own goods and payeth\r\ndouble for the same.’ When the pursuit of the flying Armada ceased want\r\nof ammunition was as much a reason as want of provisions. But if the\r\ndeposition of John Charlton, who lived in a house adjoining to that of\r\nHamon, a master gunner of the _Ark Royal_, is to be credited, that ship,\r\nat any rate, did not lack powder. Charlton informed Howard that he had\r\ndaily seen much powder taken into Hamon’s dwelling. Hamon confessed,\r\nbut according to Charlton, very incompletely, for, ‘where it was set\r\ndowne but iiii barrels I will aprove that after the fight there came to\r\nhis house fortie barrels which was to her Maiestie in that fighte greate\r\nhinderance.’ It is significant that a labourer in the employ of the\r\nOrdnance Office acknowledged that he had been hired to pick a quarrel\r\nwith Charlton and maim or kill him.[717]\r\n\r\nThe cost of cast iron ordnance was, between 1565 and 1570, from £10 to\r\n£12 a ton; in 1600 it had fallen to £8 and £9 a ton. Brass ordnance was\r\nfrom £40 to £60 a ton. The reputation of our founders stood so high that\r\nthe Spaniards were prepared to pay £22 a ton for iron guns and to give\r\na pension to the man who could smuggle them over.[718] The exportation\r\nof ordnance was strictly prohibited, but an extensive underhand trade\r\nwent on notwithstanding the efforts of the government. In February 1574\r\nall gunfounders were called upon to give bonds to £2000 apiece not to\r\ncast ordnance without licence and not to sell it to foreigners. The seat\r\nof the industry was Kent and Sussex and the requirements of the kingdom\r\nexclusive of the Royal Navy and of the royal forts, were then estimated\r\nat 600 tons a year.[719] There seem to have been only some six or seven\r\nfounders in the business, and in the following June, the Council ordered\r\nthat no one should enter into it without permission; that all guns should\r\nbe sent to the Tower wharf, there to be sold to English subjects who were\r\nto give sureties not to sell abroad out of their ships; and that all\r\nfounders were to send in a yearly return to the Master of the Ordnance of\r\nthe number of guns sold, and to whom.[720] These orders were repeated in\r\n1588 and 1601, but a founder estimated that 2500 tons of ordnance were\r\ncast a year, being three times as much as could be used in England, and\r\nit was supposed that, previous to 1592, out of 2000 tons yearly made 1600\r\nwere secretly sent abroad.\r\n\r\nAlthough the saltpetre had been obtained from the continent powder had\r\nlong been made in England as well as bought abroad. In 1562 three persons\r\nwho had erected powder mills, tendered to supply it on a large scale—200\r\nlasts a year—at £3, 5s a cwt. (of 100 lbs.) for corn powder, and £2, 16s\r\n8d for serpentine powder.[721] This offer does not seem to have been\r\naccepted although in 1560 the crown was paying £3, 5s 2d, the cwt. (of\r\n112 lbs.) for serpentine powder, and in 1570, still higher prices. In\r\nNovember 1588 there was ‘a reasonable store’ of round shot in hand and 55\r\nlasts of powder; 100 tons of shot and 100 lasts of powder were required\r\nto make good deficiencies, but in view of the amount remaining in stock\r\nonly the fatal blundering which has always characterised the departments\r\ncan explain the constant prayer for supplies that came, vainly, from the\r\nfleet.[722] Wynter, whose province it was to attend to naval requirements\r\nin these matters, was himself on service from 22nd December 1587 until\r\n15th September 1588, in command of the _Vanguard_ and the _Ark Royal_.\r\nHow the business of his office was carried on in his absence we do not\r\nknow with certainty, but from some entries in the Privy Council Register\r\nfor 1588, it would appear to have been handed over to the Ordnance\r\nOffice. The cost of the powder was here estimated at £100 a last, but\r\nin 1589 a tender from George Evelyn, John Evelyn, and Richard Hills, to\r\ndeliver 80 lasts a year for eleven years at £80 was accepted. In 1603\r\nthey, with some other partners, were still acting and furnishing 100\r\nlasts a year. Round shot, from cannon down to fawcon, was obtained at an\r\naverage of £8 a ton; ‘jointed shot,’ and cross-bar shot were dear, from\r\n2s 6d to 8s apiece, according to the size of the gun. Stone shot were\r\nstill used and cost from sixpence to two shillings each conformable to\r\nsize.[723]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Naval Expenditure.]\r\n\r\nThe naval expenses, especially during the last fifteen years of her\r\nreign, must have seemed appalling to Elizabeth and would have excused her\r\nparsimony had she not been so lavish to herself. From the _Audit Office\r\nAccounts_ we are enabled to give on the next page the amounts for which\r\nthe Treasurer of the Navy was answerable, but these by no means included\r\nall the expenditure of the crown in various expeditions. The total cost\r\nof the Cadiz and Islands voyages, for instance, of 1596 and 1597 is given\r\nas £172,260 and this is only partly represented below.[724] If the Queen\r\ntook a share in an adventure the money she advanced was paid from the\r\nExchequer and is not borne on the Navy accounts.\r\n\r\nThe £12,000 a year allotted to Gonson, under Mary, for the working of\r\nthe naval establishments during peace was reduced from 1st January\r\n1564 to £6000 a year, of which he was to pay Baeshe £165, 2s a month\r\nfor harbour victualling.[725] Of course war, or preparation for war,\r\nupset all calculations of economy, but the attempt was steadily made\r\nto keep the normal, everyday, expenses of the department separate from\r\nthe exceptional ones, and to reduce the former to as low a sum as\r\npracticable. Gonson must have found the £6000 a year impossible, for in\r\n1567 it was raised to £7695, 6s 2d. The economy could have been only\r\nnominal, for on the same date as this new order[726] there is a warrant\r\nto Gonson for £10,200 extra for stores and ship repairs which would have\r\nformerly been included in the £12,000 a year. By a statement of 1585 the\r\naverage for these years was £10,946 yearly, when building, repairs, and\r\nstores purchased were included.[740] From 1571 commences the division\r\ninto ordinary and extraordinary, which doubtless had a further saving\r\nfor its object, although how the process was to work, except as tending\r\ntowards clearer bookkeeping, is not now manifest.\r\n\r\n

Pett and Baker.[741] Twenty-five vessels of all classes were named\r\nin the agreement and Hawkyns undertook to provide their moorings, to keep\r\nspare cables and hawsers on board, and to furnish other cordage necessary\r\nfor ordinary harbour and sea use, for £1200 a year, the contract being\r\nterminable at six months’ notice. He was not to be called upon to account\r\nfor the £1200 and therefore evidently expected, and was at liberty, to\r\nmake a profit. The agreement with Pett and Baker was to the effect that\r\nthey should ground and grave the ships at least every first, second, or\r\nthird year, according to size; that they should repair or replace all\r\nfaulty masts and yards that became defective in harbour, except the lower\r\nmasts and yards of the sixteen largest vessels; that they were to pay\r\nwages, victualling and lodging of the men they employed and provide all\r\nmaterials and tools; they were to supply carpenters’ stores to vessels\r\nin commission, and pay all carriage and hire of storehouses. For this\r\nthey were to have £1000 a year. It was these two contracts that brought\r\nsuch a storm of obloquy on Hawkyns. On the one hand, the other officers\r\nfound the greater part of their occupation gone, and their interference\r\nin some of the most important transactions an unwarrantable intermeddling\r\nwith agreements approved by the government. On the other Hawkyns and\r\nthe shipwrights expected to make a profit, and circumstances seem to\r\nsuggest that the way in which Hawkyns insisted on the work being done\r\ndid not leave Pett and Baker that margin they anticipated. These two men\r\nsubsequently became his bitter enemies, and in 1588 sent in a report\r\non his management, to which events at that time were daily giving the\r\nlie. The effect of the new arrangement was to make Hawkyns supreme in\r\nall the branches of administration, and therefore every contractor or\r\nmiddleman, with whose arrangements he interfered, swelled the outcry. The\r\nresult of the commission of inquiry of January 1584 was not to displace\r\nhim, but apparently it did abrogate these contracts, and in 1585 a new\r\none was entered into with Hawkyns alone. For £4000 a year he defrayed\r\nthe repair of ships in harbour, found moorings, paid shipkeepers and\r\nthe garrison of Upnor, repaired wharves and storehouses, finding in\r\nall cases materials, victuals, and lodgings for the workmen.[742] The\r\nobject of this and the preceding agreement was to get the ordinary done\r\nfor £4000 a year, devoting the money saved to the purchase of cordage,\r\nmasts, etc., which had formerly been extra. Hawkyns maintained that he\r\nhad performed it successfully; his opponents denied it. It was the last\r\ncontract, from which they were excluded, that Pett and Baker reported\r\nupon. He gave notice to terminate it at Christmas 1587 in consequence of\r\nthe great increase in naval operations, and no third bargain was engaged\r\nin. From 1st January 1589 the amount allowed for the ordinary was raised\r\nto £7268[743] which then only restored it to the standard of 1567; in\r\nJanuary 1599 it was increased to £11,000 a year.[744]\r\n\r\nThe year to which the reader will turn with most interest is 1588, and\r\nthe figures here given, representing the payments of Hawkyns only, deal\r\nwith the expenditure through him and probably do not represent the whole,\r\neven of the naval expenses. A document printed by Murdin[745] makes the\r\nnaval disbursements, between the beginning of November 1587 and the end\r\nof September 1588, exclusive of victualling and the charges borne by\r\nLondon and other ports, reach the much larger sum of £112,000. Powder and\r\nshot were used to the value of £10,000, while £20,000 was required to\r\nreplace stores and put the fleet in seaworthy condition again. Another\r\nestimate puts the expenses of the year at £92,370.[746] It gives the cost\r\nby fleets: the Lord Admiral’s £31,980; Seymour’s £12,180; coasters and\r\nvolunteers £15,970; Frobisher’s £840; Drake’s £21,890, etc. Finally we\r\nhave the items stated in a different way[747]: wages £52,557; conduct and\r\ndischarge money £2272; tonnage (hire of) £6225; other expenses £15,003;\r\nextraordinary allowances and rewards £854. The compensation paid for\r\nthe eight vessels converted into fireships and sent among the Spaniards\r\nduring the anxious night of 28-29th July was £5111, 10s, perhaps the\r\ncheapest national investment that this country has ever made.[748] Two of\r\nthem were of 200 tons apiece, in all they measured 1230 tons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Preparation and Cost of Fleets.]\r\n\r\nThere were in pay during the struggle in the Channel 34 Queen’s ships\r\nand 163 merchantmen, but all through the year merchantmen had been taken\r\nup or discharged, and men-of-war put in and out of commission as the\r\nneed seemed more or less urgent. There were 8 admirals, 3 vice-admirals,\r\n126 captains, 136 masters, 26 lieutenants, 24 corporals, 2 ensign\r\nbearers, 2 secretaries, 13 preachers, and 11,618 soldiers, sailors, and\r\ngunners.[749] Other authorities give a larger number of men, in one\r\ninstance 15,925; and only 95 merchantmen appear in the _Audit Office\r\nAccounts_ as paid by the Treasurer. In this case the in and out working\r\nmust have puzzled the authorities considerably, but ordinarily experience\r\nhad enabled them to calculate with fair accuracy the probable cost of\r\nsending a fleet to sea. In October 1580—Drake had returned in September\r\nand Mendoza was vapouring—such an estimate was prepared for twenty\r\nmen-of-war, to be manned by 4030 seamen and gunners, and 1690 soldiers.\r\nThe press and conduct money of the seamen amounts to £1410, 10s, that of\r\nthe soldiers and their coat money to £676; sea stores of ships £800, and\r\nwages of officers and crews for one month £2669, 6s 8d. The discharge\r\nmoney for both soldiers and sailors is £1462, and one month’s provisions\r\n£4004. In all the charges make a total of £11,449 for the first month.\r\nAs there would be no cost of preparation, nor press, conduct, coat, or\r\ndischarge money to be reckoned in the following months, the cost for the\r\nsecond and succeeding months would be £6773 each. For another £12,000\r\ntwenty-two armed merchantmen, of 5200 tons and 2790 men, could be joined\r\nwith the men-of-war for three months. The last years in which foreign\r\nships appear to have been ‘stayed’ by the authority of the crown for\r\nservice with its fleets were 1560, 1561, and 1569. There is a payment of\r\n£300 in 1560 for ‘putting the Venetian’s hulk and ship that be staied for\r\nour service in warre in like order and sorte.’[750] In 1569 another £300\r\nwas paid by Gonson to two Ragusan masters whose ships were stayed but do\r\nnot appear to have been used.[751] Some other foreign vessels are also\r\nreferred to but their names do not occur in any naval paper.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of the semi-private, semi-royal, expeditions of various\r\nyears are not borne on the navy accounts and the references to them in\r\nthe State Papers are frequently incomplete and contradictory. That of\r\nFrobisher, in 1589, cost upwards of £11,000, of Frobisher and Hawkyns in\r\n1590, £17,000,[752] and of Lord Thomas Howard in 1591, £24,000.[753] The\r\noutlay attendant on Essex’s fleet in 1596 was £78,000,[754] and that of\r\nthe Drake-Hawkyns venture in 1595, £42,000.[755] Here the Queen provided\r\nsix men-of-war and, according to one statement,[756] was to have had\r\none-third of the booty, but it is difficult to disentangle the actual\r\nfacts from the several discrepant versions. The voyage was a disastrous\r\nfailure financially, treasure to £4907 only being brought home; worse\r\nstill it cost the lives of Drake and Hawkyns. The lower ranks, however,\r\ndid not fare so badly; it was said that £1000 was embezzled from the sale\r\nof powder alone, and some of the men, being drunk, ‘showed a great store\r\nof gold’ on their return.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Division of Prize Money.]\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century Monson noticed that, notwithstanding the\r\ndestruction they brought on Spanish commerce nationally, the majority\r\nof the Elizabethan adventurers not only made no fortunes but ruined\r\nthemselves by their enterprises. So far as pecuniary receipts were\r\nconcerned there were only two really great captures during the Queen’s\r\nreign. Her share of the _St Philip_, taken by Drake in 1587, was £46,672;\r\nDrake’s own, £18,235; the Lord Admiral’s, £4338; and private adventurers,\r\n£44,787.[757] A still richer haul was made in the _Madre de Dios_, taken\r\nin 1592, which, by the account of her purser, carried 8500 quintals of\r\npepper, 900 of cloves, 700 of cinnamon, 500 of cochineal, and 450 of\r\nother merchandise, besides amber, musk, and precious stones to the value\r\nof 400,000 crusados, and some especially fine diamonds.[758] In this case\r\nthere was only one Queen’s ship among the ten entitled to share, and the\r\nservices rendered by that one were questioned, but Her Majesty demanded\r\nthe lion’s share of the proceeds. If the men were not paid wages the\r\nusual arrangement for the division of prize money was that if ships were\r\ncruising, and ‘thirds’ were agreed upon, the spoil was to be divided into\r\nthree parts, viz., tonnage (_i.e._, owners), one part, the victuallers\r\nthe second part, and the men the remaining third. But if ships joined in\r\n‘consortship,’ their takings were to be first divided ton for ton, and\r\nman for man, then each vessel’s proportion was to be joined and divided\r\ninto shares as before.[759] By the second mode ships belonging to the\r\nsquadron, but absent from a particular capture, would still share the\r\npillage. The captain took ten shares, the master seven or eight, and\r\nmost of the remaining officers three to five each; if the cruiser was\r\na privateer the Lord Admiral received a tenth from each of the thirds.\r\nFor the twelve years 1587-98 Nottingham’s tenths amounted to upwards of\r\n£18,000.[760] The following computation shows the proportions due on this\r\nsystem of division assuming the value of the carrack’s cargo to have been\r\n£140,000.[761]\r\n\r\n       _Foresight_     Tonnage 450,            £8092  9  8½ }\r\n    (Queen’s Ship)     Men 170,                 7505 10  4  } £23103 10  4½\r\n                       Victualling as for men,  7505 10  4  }\r\n\r\n        _Roebuck_      Tonnage 350,             6294  3  1½ }\r\n   (Sir W.

One third of £140,000 is £46,666,\r\n13s 4d and this, divided by 2595, gives a unit of £17, 19s 6d a ton. For\r\nthe _Foresight_ 450 times £17, 19s 6d yields roughly the £8092, 9s 8½d\r\nto which her tonnage entitles her; the same formula gives the shares of\r\nthe other ships, and of the men, substituting in the latter case 1057\r\nfor 2595. The Earl of Cumberland, one of the most persistent and one of\r\nthe most unlucky of the private adventurers of his day got only £36,000,\r\nand in the end, after much bickering, Elizabeth took nearly £80,000 of\r\nthe plunder. There is no doubt that the fleet was in ‘consortship,’[762]\r\nbut it did not suit her interests to allow that form of division. The\r\nofficial belief, and one apparently well founded, was that enormous theft\r\nwent on, both among officers and men, before the prize was brought into\r\nport. Robert Cecil, who had been sent into Devonshire to make inquiries,\r\nwrote to his father that, approaching Exeter, he ‘cold well smell them\r\nalmost such has been the spoils of amber and musk among them ... there\r\nnever was such spoil.’ Officers and men pillaged first, the captains took\r\nwhat they could from them, and when the admiral, Sir John Burroughs,\r\ncame up, he plundered the captains. Among other items the Commissioners\r\nfound that an emerald cross three inches long, 62 diamonds, and 1400\r\n‘very great’ pearls had been stolen. It is not known what became of the\r\n_Madre de Dios_, but possibly an offer from the mayor and burgesses of\r\nDartmouth to pay £200 and build a hospital for the poor in return ‘for yᵉ\r\ncarrick’ may refer to it.[763]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Merchant Shipping and Trade.]\r\n\r\nIn 1584 Hawkyns wrote to Burghley ‘I ame perswydyd that the substance of\r\nthis reallme ys treblyd in vallew syns her Maiesties raygne.’ So far as\r\nthe carrying trade, as exemplified in the increase of merchant ships,\r\nwas concerned, the statement was more than justified. The legislation\r\nthat had long been directed in a more or less perfunctory manner to the\r\nencouragement of English merchant shipping by protective enactments was\r\nenforced more stringently. Such enactments were varied or renewed by the\r\n1st, 5th, 13th, 23rd, 27th and 39th of Elizabeth. The coast fisheries\r\nwere assisted by permission being granted to export fish in English\r\nbottoms, free of custom, subsidy, or poundage,[764] while the internal\r\nconsumption was increased by the more rigid exaction of the observance\r\nof fish days. The coasting trade was confined to English owned ships,\r\nand the earlier statutes bearing on exportation or importation in\r\nforeign vessels were put into active operation. These measures were not\r\nfruitless. For 1576 is a list of fifty-one ships built in the preceding\r\nfive years and attributed, rightly or wrongly, to the statute ordering\r\nabstinence from flesh on Wednesdays.[765] In 1581 the authorities of the\r\nTrinity Corporation sent in a certificate showing a large increase in\r\nthe number of fishing boats, there being in a short time, an addition\r\nof 114 on the east and south-east coasts alone between Newcastle and\r\nPortsmouth.[766]\r\n\r\nThe bounty of five shillings a ton, for vessels of 100 tons and upwards,\r\nonly paid occasionally during preceding reigns is now of common\r\noccurrence. The Exchequer warrants name 162 ships on which it was given\r\nduring the reign, and the series is probably far from complete. Certain\r\nnames frequently recur in these entries; the Hawkyns family of Plymouth;\r\nOlyff Burre, a coppersmith of Southwark, who obtained the bounty on 790\r\ntons of shipping in two years; the Fenners of Chichester; Philip and\r\nFrancis Drake; and William Borough. Sometimes seamen were both owners\r\nand masters but more frequently the owners are described as merchants.\r\nTowards the later years of the century, when the volume of ocean trade\r\nhad greatly increased, the bounty payments become almost continuous, and\r\nthen owners had to give surety not to sell their ships to foreigners.\r\nBetween 1581 and 1594 there had been built—or rather had received the\r\npremium—46 such vessels of which 25 belonged to London, 7 to Bristol, 2\r\nto Southampton, 3 to Dartmouth, and 1 each to Hull and Liverpool.[767]\r\nThe _Galleon Ughtred_ of Southampton, built by John Ughtred of Netley,\r\nwas of 500 tons, and when she was sent to sea under Fenton was valued at\r\n£6035, fitted, victualled, and munitioned.[768]\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps indicative of the results of the years 1587-8-9 that while\r\nonly 46 such vessels had been built in thirteen years, there were,\r\nbetween 1592 and 1595, 48 large ships of 10,622 tons receiving a sum\r\nof £2683, 5s. In one year—1593—London owners were paid on 16 ships of\r\n3248 tons; Dartmouth, as in the preceding century, is ahead of the other\r\nsouthern ports with seven vessels of 1460 tons.[769] From September 1596\r\nto September 1597 the bounty was paid on 57 ships of 11,160 tons; two\r\nwere of 400 tons, four of 320, two of 310, thirty-two of between 200 and\r\n300 tons, and the general increase in the tonnage of individual ships is\r\nanother noticeable fact in the growth of the shipping industry.[770]\r\n\r\nBut probably the bounty was not always paid. At the foot of a list of\r\nmerchantmen for the years 1572-9, the owners of which had given bond that\r\nthey should not be sold to the subjects of a foreign power, the clerk\r\nwrites: ‘whether all these or how many of them have had any allowance of\r\nHer Majesty I cannot tell for that there is no record of the allowance\r\nin this court.’[771] The total is 70 ships of 12,630 tons; the largest\r\nare, one of Bristol of 600 tons, one of London of 450, and one of\r\nDartmouth of 400 tons. One entry, on 9th July, 1577, is that Francis\r\nDrake of Plymouth gives bond for the _Pelican_ of 150 tons.[772] Very\r\noften the five shillings a ton was not paid but allowed on the customs,\r\nas in 1595, when 636 crowns were granted to three London merchants ‘to\r\nbe allowed on the customs of merchandise brought by the said ships.’ It\r\nwas of course to the interest of the owner to have his vessel rated at\r\nthe highest possible tonnage, both for the bounty and for service with\r\nthe royal fleets. For the latter the hire remained at one shilling a ton\r\ntill about 1580 when it was raised to two shillings and even then the\r\nmeasuring officers, we are told, usually allowed the Queen to be charged\r\nfor a third more than the real tonnage.[773]\r\n\r\nBesides the stimulus of general trade and the requirements of the crown\r\nfor ships to serve with the fleets, there was a further encouragement\r\nto building in the action of the great chartered associations then\r\nin possession of so much of the over sea trade. The Russia Company,\r\nchartered in 1555, traded to Russia, Persia, and the Caspian, and, late\r\nin the century, commenced the whale fishery; the Turkey, or Levant\r\nCompany, founded in 1581, to the dominions of the Sultan, the Greek\r\nArchipelago, and, indirectly, to the East Indies; the Eastland Company\r\ntrading through the Sound to Norway, Finland, Sweden, and Denmark;\r\nthe Guinea Company to the west coast of Africa, and the Merchant\r\nAdventurers along the northern coast of continental Europe. Many of the\r\nlargest ocean-going ships either belonged to, or were hired by, these\r\ncorporations, and owners who had entered into the prevalent spirit of\r\nshipbuilding felt that they had a right to have their vessels hired by\r\nthe companies. Olyff Burre, the speculative owner before mentioned,\r\npetitioned the Council in 1579 to the effect that he had obtained a\r\nliving for forty years ‘cheefely by the maynteyninge of shippinge and\r\nthe navygacon,’ that he now had a number of vessels unemployed, and that\r\nhe trusted they would order the Spanish Company to hire his ships.[774]\r\nIn 1581 the Levant Company possessed fourteen ships varying in size from\r\n200 to 350 tons; they complain, in a petition, that the new import duties\r\nlevied by the Venetians are destroying their trade, and that their ships\r\nare too big to be employed in any other work.[775] In the five years\r\n1583-7 this company employed nineteen vessels and 787 men in twenty-seven\r\nvoyages, and paid £11,359 in customs. In 1600 they owned thirteen of 2610\r\ntons and hired seventeen of 2650 tons. Their agent at Constantinople\r\ncost £1000 a year, besides presents to the Turks, and in 1591 they\r\ncalculated that, first and last, they had been compelled to spend £40,000\r\nin maintaining agents, consuls, etc.[776] The profits made by these\r\ncompanies were sometimes enormous and their risks were fewer than those\r\nof individual owners, for their large, well-armed and manned ships were\r\nless exposed to the dangers of navigation and piracy, the latter a factor\r\nto be always reckoned with.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding piracy, warfare, and the risks of navigation in little\r\nknown seas, the returns show a steady increase in the size and number of\r\nEnglish vessels. The necessities of distant trading explain the increase\r\nin size both in view of a relatively smaller cost of working and a larger\r\nnumber of partners interested in the cargo, and the results of successful\r\nmaritime war were shown in a carrying trade which it may almost be held\r\nto have founded. But an extension of commerce was sometimes thrust\r\nunwillingly on the English merchants. Some of them petitioned in 1571\r\nthat the trade with Portugal was of more value than that with the East\r\nIndies, and that an agreement should be come to with the King of Portugal\r\nby which Englishmen would undertake not to trade with the East if a free\r\nopening were given by that monarch in his European dominions. They said\r\nthat the traffic to the East Indies ‘often attempted hath taken small\r\neffect,’ that in fifteen years no merchants had made any profit, ‘except\r\nsuch as being spoiled there have made great gain by the recompense\r\nhere.’[777] They did not foresee the future subjects of spoliation,\r\nbut although trade was progressing it moved onwards tentatively and\r\nwith hesitation; and but for the cessation of trade with Portugal the\r\nformation of the East India Company might have been long deferred.\r\n\r\nIf a merchantman escaped the ordinary risks of the sea as they were\r\nunderstood in the sixteenth century, risks that included much more than\r\nis comprised in the expression to-day, the owner’s troubles were by no\r\nmeans over. Commerce with the East could only be carried on by constant\r\nbribery; if he traded to Spain he had to reckon with the suspicious\r\nbigotry of Church and State, and when returned to England he had to deal\r\nwith the more selfish dishonesty of custom-house officials, and sometimes\r\nof persons of higher rank. Three victims of Spanish procedure petition\r\nBurghley:—\r\n\r\n    ‘In this moste wofull manner sheweth unto your Honour your\r\n    suppliantes John Tyndall and Robert Frampton of Bristowe and\r\n    William Ellize of Alperton ... late marchants and the Quenes\r\n    Maiesties naturall subjectes late in case right good to\r\n    live and nowe in state most miserable. That where your said\r\n    suppliantes did trade into Spayne in the way of marchandise—soe\r\n    it is Right Honourable that besydes longe and miserable\r\n    imprisonment besydes the intollerable torment of the Strappadoe\r\n    there susteyned by the authoritie of the Inquisition of Spayne\r\n    your said suppliantes are there spoyled of all their goodes to\r\n    the vallew of ˡⁱ2228 10ˢ 6ᵈ, to their utter undoing.’[778]\r\n\r\nTheir ship was seized and they were tortured because a Cato in English\r\nwas found on board—Spain and England being at peace. They go on to ask\r\nthat they may have restitution out of Spanish goods in England. In 1588,\r\nof the crew of a Scotch ship just arrived at St Lucar, ‘accused to be\r\nprotestantes and fleshe eaters on dayes prohibite,’ three were burnt and\r\nthe rest sent to the galleys, upon accusation, without any trial.[779]\r\nAs the knowledge of these and other stories spread, one does not wonder\r\nat the massacres of Smerwick and Connaught; it is only a matter for\r\nsurprise that any Spanish prisoner received quarter.\r\n\r\nIt was a usual clause in a charter-party that a merchantman should carry\r\nordnance and small arms. In the peaceful Bordeaux fleet of 1593, the\r\nthree largest vessels carried from 17 to 21 guns, and all the others\r\nhave from 3 to 16 pieces of various sizes. Owners whose vessels had\r\nescaped the perils of the voyage had to be prepared for trickery at\r\nhome. Accusations of dishonesty were general against the officers of\r\nthe customs; ‘they alter their books leaving out and putting in what\r\npleases them’; the wages of the waiters were £12, 16s a year, but some of\r\nthem kept large establishments, the officers were said to attend about\r\ntwo-and-a-half hours daily, and the chief ones seldom came at all. These\r\nlatter, says the writer, appointed clerks who grew rich the same way, and\r\nthese again took under clerks who made a living out of the merchants;\r\nthe chief posts were sold at high prices, while, in the country, the\r\nQueen was defrauded of half the customs.’[780] Another person, writing to\r\nRobert Cecil in 1594, says ‘there has been transported out of Rye within\r\ntwelve months not less than £10,000 of prohibited wares. The customs\r\nofficers not only connive but help.’[781] Other examples might be cited\r\nto show that there had not been much improvement in these years, although\r\nthe service had been reorganised in 1586 when the Customer, Sir Thos.\r\nSmith, who farmed some of the imposts, had been compelled to disgorge\r\na portion of his profits. The revenue from the customs was £24,000 in\r\n1586, in 1590 £50,000, and £127,000 in 1603. If the merchant escaped the\r\nextortions of the custom house he might find that persons of the highest\r\nrank did not disdain to avail themselves of the organised chicane of the\r\nlaw. In 1586 Leicester sent a cargo to Barbary, and in the return lading,\r\nthe factor thought it safer, on account of pirates and other enemies, to\r\nmark all his employers’ goods with Leicester’s mark. On the arrival of\r\nthe ship Elizabeth’s favourite claimed the whole cargo and, the law being\r\non his side, the owners were compelled to compound with him for their own\r\nproperty.[782]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Returns of Merchant Ships and Seamen.]\r\n\r\nThere are more detailed lists of merchant ships for the period under\r\nreview than for any other reign. By these lists, equivalent to a return\r\nof vessels now built to Admiralty requirements, the government knew, from\r\ntime to time, how many ships could be relied on as fighting auxiliaries\r\nand how many could be used as tenders and transports. They also enabled\r\nthe Council to judge whether the measures taken for the protection and\r\nencouragement of native shipping were successful. The first of these\r\nreturns is for March 1560 and is incomplete since there is no entry for\r\nsuch a port as Bristol, and Somerset and the Welsh counties are also\r\nomitted:—[783]\r\n\r\n  +----------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\r\n  |                |Tons|Tons|Tons|Tons|Tons|Tons|Tons|Tons|\r\n  |                | 100| 120| 140| 160| 180| 200| 260| 300|\r\n  |                +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\r\n  | London         | 1  | 2  | 6  | 4  | 3  | 2  | 1  | 2  |\r\n  | Saltash        |    |    | 1  |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  | Fowey          | 1  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  | Northam        | 1  | 1  | 1  |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  | Plymouth       | 2  | 1  |    | 1  |    |    |    |    |\r\n  | Salcombe       | 1  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  | Dartmouth      |    | 1  | 3  |    |    | 1  |    |    |\r\n  | Cockington     | 1  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  | Kingswear      |    | 2  | 1  | 1  |    |    |    |    |\r\n  | Southampton    |    |    | 1  |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  | Christchurch   |    | 1  |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  | Sandwich       |    |    | 1  |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  | Brightlingsea  | 1  |    | 1  |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  | Walderswick    | 2  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  | Southwold      | 1  |    | 1  |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  | Cley           |    |    | 1  |    |    | 1  |    |    |\r\n  | Wells          |    |    | 2  |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  | Grimsby        | 1  |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  | Scarborough    |    |    | 1  |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  | Hull           | 4  | 1  | 1  |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  | Newcastle      | 12 |    | 1  |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  | Chester        | 1  |    | 1  |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  +----------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\r\n\r\nHere there are seventy-six ships and although some towns, such as\r\nSouthampton, may not have their full complement given, there was probably\r\nno other port, with the exception of Bristol, possessing vessels of 100\r\ntons or upwards. During the early years of the reign the country was\r\nimpoverished and the people little inclined to effort. Mary left the\r\ncrown deeply indebted and, concurrently with an increase of national\r\nexpenditure, there was, for the moment, a general decline of commerce,\r\nand a shifting of the centres of commercial distribution, especially\r\nfelt by some of the older seaports. Yarmouth petitioned in 1559 for\r\nrelief from payment of the tenths and fifteenths on account of loss of\r\ntrade; their harbour had cost them £1000 a year and was not yet finished,\r\nthe town walls £100 a year, and the relief of their poor yet another\r\nhundred.[784] In 1565 Yarmouth had 553 householders; 7 seagoing ships,\r\nof which the largest was 140 tons; 25 smaller ones, and 81 fishing boats\r\ntogether with 400 seamen.[785] Doubtless the burgesses did not minimise\r\ntheir calamities but similar complaints came in from all quarters. Hythe\r\nhad, from 80 vessels and fishing boats sunk to 8; Winchilsea, ‘there\r\nis at this present none, and the town greatly decayed.’[786] Between\r\n1558 and 1565 Dartmouth owners had lost four and sold eleven ships,\r\nand seemingly had no intention of replacing fifteen others worn out by\r\nservice. The complaints of Chester are chronic in the same sense; its\r\nmerchants had lost £22,000 in seven years from piracies and shipwrecks;\r\nand Hull in a shorter period had lost £23,000 from the same causes.\r\n\r\nThe next list, of 1568,[787] gives seventy-three vessels of 100 tons\r\nor more but from this many important places, such as London, Bristol,\r\nHull, and others are wanting so that it may be assumed that a marked\r\nimprovement had already commenced. There are many isolated certificates\r\nof ships belonging to various ports scattered through the State Papers,\r\nand from one of them we find that ‘Hawkyns of Plymouth’ possessed, in\r\n1570, thirteen of 2040 tons; one of them was of 500 and another of 350\r\ntons. There is a certificate of vessels trading between September 1571\r\nand September 1572,[788] which gives eighty-six of 100 tons and upwards,\r\nincluding forty-nine of 6870 tons belonging to London, but this is not a\r\ncomplete list of ships owned in the various ports, but only of those that\r\nhad been engaged in trade. For February 1577 there is a full return which\r\nyields the following results:—[789]\r\n\r\n  +-----------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n  |           |Ton|Ton|Ton|Ton|Ton|Ton|Ton|Ton|Ton|Ton|Ton|Ton|Ton|Ton|Ton|\r\n  |           |100|110|120|130|140|150|160|180|200|220|240|260|300|350|500|\r\n  |           +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n  |London     | 10|  6|  7|  4|  4|  1|  3|   |  4|  2|  1|   |  1|  1|   |\r\n  |Bristol    |  1|   |  1|   |  2|  1|  1|   |  1|   |   |   |   |   |  1|\r\n  |Chester    |  1|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |Newport    |  2|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |Chepstow   |  1|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |Barnstaple |  1|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |Fowey      |  1|   |  1|   |   |   |  1|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |Looe       |  1|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |Plymouth   |  2|  1|  1|  1|  1|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |Dartmouth  |  1|   |  1|   |   |   |  1|   |   |   |   |   |   |  1|   |\r\n  |Exmouth    |  3|   |   |  1|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |Weymouth   |  1|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |Poole      |  2|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |Southampton|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |     &     |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  | Portsmouth|  1|  1|  1|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |Dover      |  1|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |Harwich and|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  | Ipswich   |  7|   |  2|   |  1|  1|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |Woodbridge |  1|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |Orford and |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  | Aldborough|  3|  1|   |   |  5|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |Walderswick|  1|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |Yarmouth   |  4|   |   |  1|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |Lynn       |  2|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |Hull       |  3|  1|  3|   |   |  2|   |   |  1|   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  |Newcastle  |  6|  1|  3|   |  2|   |  1|   |  1|   |   |   |   |   |   |\r\n  +---------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n\r\nThe total is 135 and the report says that there are 656 more between 40\r\nand 100 tons besides ‘an infinite number’ of small barks.

When the Levant Company was founded its\r\npromoters were called before the Council, thanked and praised for\r\nbuilding ships of suitable tonnage for the trade, and urged to go forward\r\n‘for the kingdom’s sake.’ The Levant Company returned at first 300%\r\nprofit to its shareholders but in the sixteenth century ‘the kingdom’s\r\nsake’ was a factor, always more or less present, in the action of the\r\nmerchant class, nor was the commendation of the lords of the Council\r\nconsidered a matter of small importance. In a national as well as in a\r\nprivate sense it was fortunate that most of these chartered Companies\r\nwere originally successful.

The 1582\r\nlist and the _Harleian MS._ differ somewhat but they are sufficiently\r\nalike in classification and totals to show that they belong to nearly the\r\nsame period; the _Cottonian MS._ is the same in form and almost exactly\r\nthe same in results, and must be wrongly dated. There is no other list of\r\nships belonging to this reign, but there are occasional references which\r\nshow that the subject was not neglected. For February 1589 there is a\r\nnote of large merchantmen at sea during that month; thirteen of 2940 tons\r\nare ‘in the Straights,’ five in ‘Barbaria’ and three bound there, five\r\nfor Bordeaux, eleven for Middleburgh, and six at sea ‘adventuring.’[794]\r\nThe total tonnage is 7220. Evidently the government was kept well\r\ninformed of the position of the trading vessels it might possibly require\r\nfor transport or warfare. Notwithstanding the various encouragements\r\nto native owners the foreign carrying trade was by no means destroyed\r\nfor, in the year ending September 1596, no fewer than 646 ‘strangers’\r\nships’ came to London.[795] In Jan. 1597 there were 197 vessels entered\r\ninwards at London; two were from Stade, two from Tripoli, one from\r\nVenice, six from Spain, twenty-six from Bordeaux, ten from Dantzic, three\r\nfrom Hamburg, one from Scotland, and most of the others from the Low\r\nCountries.[796]\r\n\r\nWith the certificates of ships there was sometimes a return of the men\r\navailable to man them. It has been noticed that there was seldom much\r\ndifficulty in obtaining crews, and the table below points to a growth of\r\nthe maritime population commensurate with the increase of shipping:—\r\n\r\n  +-----------------+----------+-----------+----------+----------+\r\n  |                 | 1560[797]|1565-6[798]| 1570[799]| 1582[800]|\r\n  |                 +----------+-----------+----------+----------+\r\n  |Cornwall         |   1703   |           |    1064  |    1918  |\r\n  |Devon            |   1268   |           | 1264[801]|    2165  |\r\n  |Dorset           |    255   |    347    |     318  |     645  |\r\n  |Hampshire        |    296   |    167    |     342  |     470  |\r\n  |Sussex           |    400   |           |     321  |     513  |\r\n  |Cinque Ports     |    396   |   1024    |          |     952  |\r\n  |Essex            |    565   |   1549    |     385  |     693  |\r\n  |Suffolk          |    415   |   1161    |    1156  |    1282  |\r\n  |Norfolk          |    178   |    975    |    1112  |    1670  |\r\n  |Lincolnshire     |    229   |    234    |          |     449  |\r\n  |Kent             |          |           |          |     243  |\r\n  |Yorkshire        |    542   |           |     505  |     878  |\r\n  |Cheshire[802]    |    135   |           |          |     324  |\r\n  |Gloucestershire  |    203   |           |          |     220  |\r\n  |Pembrokeshire    |    392   |           |          |          |\r\n  |Northumberland   |     37   |           |          |     851  |\r\n  |Somerset         |          |           |      63  |     512  |\r\n  |London and      }|          |           |          |          |\r\n  |River of Thames }|          |           |          | 2286[803]|\r\n  |Cumberland       |          |           |          |     212  |\r\n  +-----------------+----------+-----------+----------+----------+\r\n\r\nThe certificate from which the last column is taken shows that in 1582\r\nthere were 1488 masters, 11,515 seamen, 2299 fishermen, and 957 London\r\nwatermen available for service. A fleet of 24 Queen’s ships required\r\nabout 3700 seamen; an auxiliary fleet of 24 armed merchantmen about\r\n3000, so that except when exposed to the strain of a year like 1588 the\r\nresources of the country in men were fully equal to any demand likely to\r\nbe made upon them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Piracy and Privateering.]\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Elizabeth piracy appears to have almost attained the\r\ndignity of a recognised profession, and some notice of its extent is\r\nnecessary to enable us to recognise the difficulties amid which commerce\r\nwas extending. In 1563 there were some 400 known pirates in the four\r\nseas; and men of good family, who subsequently acquired official rank\r\nin the royal service—Champernounes, Killigrews, Careys, Horseys, and\r\nOglanders—had made their earliest bids for fortune as Channel rovers.\r\nOccasionally, when an important personage was inconvenienced, a spasmodic\r\neffort was made and dire punishment followed. In 1573, the Earl of\r\nWorcester, while travelling to France as the bearer of a christening\r\npresent from Elizabeth to the infant daughter of Charles IX, was attacked\r\nbetween Dover and Boulogne and, although he saved the gold salver he\r\nwas entrusted with, eleven or twelve of his attendants were killed and\r\nwounded and property stolen to the value of £500. This led to steps that\r\nresulted in the capture of some hundreds of pirates, but only three\r\nwere hanged. On the whole, Elizabeth made fewer efforts to deal with\r\nthe evil than either her sister or brother did; sometimes ships were\r\nsent to sea for the purpose but there were no continuous endeavours\r\nsuch as they made. And although pirates were frequently taken few were\r\nexecuted, and their aiders and abettors on shore, a class that included\r\nmerchants, country squires, and government officials, were always let\r\noff with a fine. In truth the English rover was more than half patriot;\r\nif he injured English commerce he did infinitely more hurt to that of\r\nFrance and Spain, and he only differed in degree from the semi-trading,\r\nsemi-marauding expeditions on a large scale, in which the Queen herself\r\ntook a share, and for which she lent her ships.\r\n\r\nAt first Elizabeth sent out even fewer ships than her predecessors had\r\ncommissioned to clear the Channel; she tried, as usual, to make those\r\nprincipally interested do the work of the crown. Commissions were\r\ngranted to merchants to equip vessels to catch pirates, their reward\r\ntaking the form of a permission to recoup themselves out of captured\r\ncargo. But even if pirate plunder was recaptured the owners were little\r\nbetter off as the men were commonly serving ‘for the spoyle onely without\r\nany wagies allowed them by hir Hignes,’ and the spoil seldom covered\r\ntheir wages. In 1574 both Hull and Bristol were authorised to equip\r\nships at their own expense to deal with the scourge, and as late as 1600\r\npetitioners were cynically informed that Royal ships could not be spared\r\nfor convoy duty and that the merchants interested should get together\r\nten or twelve vessels ‘by voluntary contributions from subjects.’[804]\r\nProclamation followed proclamation without effect and it was not until\r\n1577 that a really serious attempt was made to crush the freebooters;\r\nPalmer and Holstock were sent to sea with a squadron, and searching\r\ninquiries were instituted to ascertain the persons who dealt with them\r\nashore and helped them. Southampton was a flourishing centre; not only\r\ndid the mayor release captured men, but there were brokers in the town\r\nwho made a business of negotiation between owners and pirates for the\r\nreturn of ships and merchandise taken by the latter.[805] Among the\r\npersons fined for dealing with pirates we find the mayor of Dartmouth,\r\nthe lieutenant of Portsmouth, the deputy searcher of the customs there;\r\nthe deputy of the Vice-Admiral of Bristol trading with them and taking\r\nbills from them,[806] the sheriff of Glamorganshire, and Wm. Wynter, a\r\nrelative of the Surveyor of the Navy. Wm. Hawkyns, brother of the Navy\r\nTreasurer, and Rich. Grenville, the famous captain of the _Revenge_,\r\nwere both up before the Council for piracy.[807] A well-known pirate,\r\nAtkinson, escaped from Exeter gaol, it was supposed with the connivance\r\nof the mayor; the mayor accused the sergeant of the Admiralty, and the\r\nevidence seems to show that they were both involved. Sometimes a pirate\r\ncargo must have been very valuable; one was made up of 434 ‘elephants’\r\nteeth,’ cochineal, wine, and ‘Spanish aquavitæ.’ If in need of supplies\r\nthe pirate captain could always reckon on sympathy and assistance ashore,\r\nand Cardiff was a recognised headquarters where necessaries could be\r\nobtained. If caught by weather and in distress he could usually rely on\r\nlocal help. One vessel, being driven ashore, was deserted by her crew,\r\na proceeding which, if due to fear, was unnecessarily hasty. A local\r\nmagnate, Sir Rich. Rogers, got assistance, refloated the vessel, and\r\nrestored her to the captain, accepting a tun of wine and a chest of\r\nsugar in acknowledgment.[808] Yet the government dealt tenderly with\r\nthese men. Of the many names of pirate captains continually recurring\r\nin the Elizabethan papers there is not one known to have been executed\r\nalthough some were captured.\r\n\r\nIn 1584 it was said that ‘wee and the French are most infamous for\r\nour outrageous, common, and daily piracies,’ and naturally the State\r\nPapers are full of petitions for redress and compensation, and with\r\ncommissions of inquiry issued to the various local authorities. Claim and\r\ncounterclaim from Englishman, Scotchman, Frenchman, Dane, and Hamburger,\r\nfollow in endless confusion. In 1586 a correspondent wrote to Burghley ...\r\n\r\n    ‘being at St Malo last month he heard that sixteen of their\r\n    ships had been rifled or taken by Englishmen ... and that their\r\n    hatred of the English was such that our merchants dared not\r\n    walk about in public ... men in authority to recover their\r\n    unthriftiness sell their lands, buy ships, and command the\r\n    captain and company not to return without assurance of a very\r\n    great sum.’[809]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Bristol, in 1574, had formally complained of St Malo\r\nin that ‘by common consent’ they had set forth seven vessels to prey upon\r\nBristol commerce. The court of Admiralty had granted Bristol merchants\r\npermission to seize St Malo ships and goods, which perhaps explains the\r\nletter to Burghley just quoted.[810] In 1584 the French ambassador stated\r\nthat in the preceding two years English pirates had plundered Frenchmen\r\nof merchandise to the value of 200,000 crowns; the only answer given was\r\nthe general statement that Englishmen had lost more by French pirates.\r\nThere is a list, 47 pages long, of piracies committed by the English on\r\nPortuguese subjects alone.\r\n\r\nBetween 1564 and 1586 Englishmen had spoiled the Scotch—who were said to\r\n‘take it unkindly’—of goods valued at £20,717, and restitution had been\r\nmade to the amount of £3483. But between 1581-5, the Scotch had plundered\r\nthe English to the sum of £9268, and had restored only £140; from this\r\nproportion it may be concluded that the Scot was more successful than\r\nthe Frenchman in adapting himself to the fashionable pursuit of the\r\ntime.[811] Nor were the injured persons exposed only to the loss of\r\ntheir property. A Bayonne ship was captured by a Bristol privateer in\r\n1591 and the owners came to England to obtain redress, but after vainly\r\nexpending 500 crowns they were, ‘fain to leave off their suit and return\r\nto France and save their lives.’ But the Englishman did not fare better\r\nin France. In 1572 the _Pelican_ of London, belonging to alderman Wm.\r\nBond and others, was seized by French pirates, the master and crew,\r\ntwenty-three in number, murdered, and goods valued at £4000 taken with\r\nher. The thieves and the receivers were both well known and the owners\r\ncommenced a suit in the parliament of Brittany; but after fruitlessly\r\nexpending £1000 prefer to ‘leave all in the hands of God rather than\r\nprosecute any more suits in France.’[812] Frequently there was little\r\ndisguise about ownership. In 1580 three Hamburg merchants petition that\r\ntheir ships were despoiled by ‘one called the _Henry Seckforde_ whereof\r\nis owner, Henry Seckforde, Esq., one of the gentlemen of your Majesty’s\r\nprivy chamber.’[813] If business at sea was languishing, the pirate did\r\nnot disdain to vary his methods; some Dunkirkers planned, and nearly\r\nsucceeded in carrying out, the abduction of Sir John Spencer, known as\r\n‘rich Spencer’ on his way to his country house at Islington.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, but very rarely, the pirate changed his allegiance.\r\nNicholas Franklin deposes:—[814]\r\n\r\n    ‘A year ago was with Captain Elliott when they took a flyboat\r\n    of which captain Elliot made a man-of-war: they went to\r\n    Helford in Cornwall and brought in a Dieppe prize.... John\r\n    Killigrew, captain of the castle there, warned them to be off\r\n    as he was expecting the _Crane_ one of the Queen’s ships;\r\n    thereupon Elliott gave him nine bolts of Holland cloth and a\r\n    chest and they sailed to Cork ... thence back to the Channel\r\n    and took four Scotch and Irish ships, thence to the Isles of\r\n    Bayonne.’[815]\r\n\r\nHere they met some Spaniards, and his crew wanted to fight, but Elliot\r\nand his officers drew their swords and forced the men to surrender.\r\nElliot was given the command of a Spanish galleon and, from another\r\npaper, it appears that he was afterwards the cause of some Englishmen\r\nbeing racked.\r\n\r\nIf letters of marque were given they only faintly veiled the real\r\ncharacter of the proceedings. In 1586 letters of reprisal were granted\r\nto Diggory Piper in the _Sweepstakes_ of London, an appropriate name for\r\na privateer. He was authorised to attack Spanish and Portuguese ships;\r\nhe commenced with some Flemings, continued with two French traders,\r\nand finished with a Dane having goods worth £3000 on board.[816] In\r\nview of the fact that at various times letters of reprisal to the\r\namount of £140,000 were issued to only a few places,[817] the amount of\r\nunlicensed robbery done under cover of such letters can be imperfectly\r\nimagined. Sometimes the proceedings were straightforward enough and, as\r\nan illustration of their manner of dealing with Spanish ships and the\r\nprivateersman’s contempt for odds, a relation of one of these encounters\r\nis given subsequently.[818]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stores.]\r\n\r\nIn 1579 the stores, such as canvas, cordage, masts, anchors, etc., at\r\nDeptford and on board the ships were valued at £8000, and it was only\r\nconsidered necessary to replenish the stock up to £14,000.[819] For some\r\ntime whatever was used in any given year was replaced the following\r\nyear; thus stores to £1662, 11s 8d and £831, 11s 1d were used in 1580\r\nand 1581, and were ordered to be made good in 1581 and 1582. The heavy\r\nexpenses caused by the war upset this arrangement, and in 1589 we find a\r\npayment of £8921, 8s 8d for the balance, still owing, of stores bought in\r\n1587. In 1602 there were at Deptford, 551 cables and hawsers, 26 bolts\r\nof canvas, 45 masts and 660 spars, 31,220 ft. of timber, 36 barrels of\r\npitch and tar, besides compasses, flags, etc. Chatham had only 10 cables\r\nbut 54 bolts of canvas, 124 masts and 1076 spars; Woolwich had timber\r\nonly.[820] Masts were obtained from the Baltic and varied in length\r\nfrom twelve to thirty-four yards, the latter size being twenty-eight\r\nhands in circumference at the partners, and eighteen and two-thirds at\r\nthe top end. Anything under six hands at the partners was accounted a\r\nspar.[821] In 1588 masts of twenty-nine and thirty yards were £26, and\r\n£31. In the year of Elizabeth’s accession Dantzic cordage cost £13, 6s\r\n8d a ton. Subsequently cables were chiefly purchased from the Russia\r\nCompany and went up in price until in 1597 Russian cordage ‘of perfect\r\ngood stuff’ was costing £23, 10s a ton.[822] For the heaviest anchors\r\nthe rule was to give a half inch in the circumference of the cable for\r\nevery foot of beam; a ship with thirty-eight feet of beam would therefore\r\nhave some cables nineteen inches in circumference. The length was 100\r\nfathoms, and the weight of one fourteen inches round was 34 cwt. 3 qrs.\r\n14 lbs. in white, and 43 cwt. 35 lbs. tarred. A large number of cables,\r\ncablettes and hawsers were carried. Although in the preceding table on p.\r\n124 the _Merhonour_, like the other big ships, is allowed seven cables,\r\nthere were ordered for her in 1589, two of 18 inches circumference\r\nweighing five tons; four of 17 inches weighing nine tons; two of 16\r\ninches weighing four tons; and one of 12 inches weighing one ton and a\r\nquarter.[823]\r\n\r\nUntil about 1585 the custom of the principal Officers themselves to\r\nsell the Queen minor stores, such as canvas, tar, etc., if it excited\r\ncomment or suspicion, does not seem to have been stopped; from Burghley’s\r\nnotes on the subject it appears from that time to have been no longer\r\nallowed.[824] Nevertheless in 1589 Hawkyns and Borough were accused of\r\nstill selling to the crown through third persons, but the force of the\r\ncharge is vitiated by the usual proposal of the informer, that he should\r\nact as an inspector of canvas, of course with a salary.[825] The heaviest\r\nanchor made was of 30 cwt., but they were usually much smaller; the\r\n_Merhonour_ had one of 25 cwt., four of 22 cwt., three of 20 cwt., and\r\none of 12 cwt.[826] The price of these was £1 10s per cwt. as against £1\r\n2s in the beginning of the reign. The following is an abstract of the\r\nprices of other stores but there were many different qualities in each\r\narticle which explains large variations in the price:—\r\n\r\n         { Polldavy (1558) 40s a bolt\r\n         { English Midrenex (1569) 28s a bolt\r\n  Canvas { British[827] do.

In 1592 the Levant Company\r\nwas permitted to use ‘the armes of Englande with the redd crosse in\r\nwhite over the same as heretofore they used.’[830] Representations of\r\nsaints on flags had ceased but other emblems were still in use; falcons,\r\nlions, the royal arms, and ‘her Maiesties badges in silver and gold,’ are\r\nmentioned. We have ‘sarcenets of divers colours’ for ensigns, red and\r\nblue say for banners, red say for streamers, and red and white cloth for\r\nflags.[831] The Cadiz fleet of 1596 had four large flags, one white, one\r\norange tawney, one blue, and one crimson, ‘which were appointed to be so\r\nmade for the distinguishing of the four squadrons of the flete.’[832]\r\nThis appears to have been the earliest distinction of squadrons by flags,\r\nafterwards shown by the red, white, and blue. The salute to the flag was\r\nupheld under circumstances where it might have been more diplomatic to\r\nescape the necessity of claiming it. When Anne of Austria was expected to\r\ntravel by sea to Spain to marry Philip, De Guaras wrote, ‘although it is\r\nquite incredible it is generally affirmed that when our fleet passes, the\r\nEnglish fleet will force it to salute. This absurdity sounds like a joke\r\nbut it is asserted by persons of weight who assure us that the admiral\r\nbears orders to do all manner of wonderful things if our fleet does not\r\nsalute.’ It is said, however, that they had to salute.\r\n\r\nIt speaks sufficiently for the courage of the Elizabethan sailor that\r\nduring the whole of the reign only two English men-of-war were captured\r\nby Spain, and then only after desperate fighting against overwhelming\r\nsuperiority of force.[833] It speaks equally well for his seamanship\r\nafloat and the skill and good workmanship of shipwrights ashore that,\r\nwith the exception of the small _Lion’s Whelp_, no dockyard built ship\r\nwas lost by stress of weather, by fire, or by running aground. During the\r\nsame years, and sometimes during the same gales, that the English ships\r\nweathered successfully, whole Spanish fleets foundered at sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES I\r\n\r\n1603-1625\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Condition of the Navy.]\r\n\r\nOn 24th March 1603 the weapon forged by Henry VIII, and wielded by\r\nElizabeth, fell into the feeble hand of James Stewart. Elizabeth left\r\nEngland supreme at sea; the Royal Navy bequeathed by the Queen to her\r\nsuccessor was by far the finest fleet of men-of-war then afloat, for it\r\nwas not until the close of the sixteenth century that Spain and Holland\r\ncommenced to build ships for purely fighting purposes.[834] The men who\r\nmanned it were renowned for hardihood, daring, and smart seamanship; and\r\nits organisation as controlled by the great seamen of her reign was more\r\nefficient and smoother in its working than any other of the departments\r\nof state.[835] Even in 1558 the days were in reality long past when\r\nSpanish fleets were to be feared, and when the Bay of Biscay could be\r\nproudly called ‘the Spanish Sea’; but it was due to Elizabeth’s sagacity\r\nthat the weapon which was to slay the Goliath threatening European\r\ncivilisation was at once recognised and unhesitatingly used. Until 1558\r\nthe supremacy even of the Channel, often hardly contested, had been\r\nonly occasionally gained. Elizabeth was the first of English sovereigns\r\nthroughout the whole of whose reign the national flag flew supreme and\r\ntriumphant in the English Channel. That she was aided by the legacy of\r\na fleet, by the helplessness of France, by changing economic conditions\r\nat home, by the revolt of the United Provinces abroad, and possibly by\r\nthe wisdom of far-seeing advisers, may have made her task easier, but\r\nthese things do not detract from the praise due to her discernment. The\r\nstudent, perhaps too often reasoning with a knowledge of results, may\r\nsometimes feel anger with Elizabeth but hardly contempt. James arouses\r\nno qualification of emotion. He commenced his reign with a fleet ‘fit\r\nto go anywhere and do anything;’ he allowed it to crumble away while\r\nspending on it more money during peace than Elizabeth did during war;\r\nhe chose the most unfit men to manage it at home and command it abroad,\r\nand the results of his weak and purposeless rule were seen in the\r\nshameful fiasco of 1625 and the degradation of English prestige. Had not\r\nBuckingham reorganised the Admiralty in 1618 there would shortly have\r\nbeen no Navy to rouse the jealousy of foreign powers. The Regency of 1423\r\ndeliberately destroyed the Navy either from ignorance or from motives\r\nnow unknown; James followed the same course with the best intentions and\r\ncould doubtless have justified all his actions in choice Latinity. It\r\nwill be seen that he took an even keener personal interest in the Navy\r\nthan did Elizabeth, but the lack of controlling capacity so disastrously\r\nshown in other affairs was equally fatal to naval administration. The\r\nnaval records of his reign are but a sorry collection of relations of\r\nfrauds, embezzlements, commissions of inquiry, and feeble palliatives.\r\n\r\nThe first wish of the new monarch was to obtain peace with Spain, a\r\ndesire for which modern historians have unanimously praised him, although\r\nit may be at least a matter for debate whether the continuance of war\r\nuntil Spain was bled to death would not have been ethically justifiable,\r\npolitically expedient, and commercially profitable. On 23rd June 1603,\r\na proclamation was issued recalling all vessels which had been sent\r\nout with hostile intent, and thus ending the lucrative privateering\r\nspeculations which, when undertaken on a small scale, had so long\r\nprovided occupation and profit for English sailors and merchants. The\r\nlast important prize taken by the Queen’s ships was the _St Valentine_, a\r\nPortuguese carrack captured by Sir R. Leveson in 1602, and its cargo was\r\nsold in 1604 for upwards of £26,000.[836]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shipbuilding.]\r\n\r\nThe improvements in construction that marked the close of the sixteenth\r\ncentury have already been noticed and first, among these may be placed\r\nthe increase in length and decrease in height above water attributed to\r\nSir John Hawkyns. But the greater demand for faster and more seaworthy\r\nships had not produced models satisfactory to the more critical experts\r\nof this generation. Shipbuilding was not yet a science and seemed in\r\nsome respects to have even retrograded from the standard of the last\r\nyears of Henry VIII. The subsequent tendency to overload ships, however\r\nsmall, with towering poop and forecastle structures, although it can be\r\nexplained by the necessity for providing increased accommodation, can\r\nscarcely be considered an improvement on the earlier type. Captain George\r\nWaymouth, who appears to have been considered an authority on the theory\r\nand practice of shipbuilding and navigation, and who was several times\r\ncalled to report independently on the workmanship displayed on the royal\r\nships, was very severe on his professional contemporaries, and writes\r\nthat he\r\n\r\n    ‘Yet could never see two ships builded of the like proportion\r\n    by the best and most skilful shipwrights though they have\r\n    many times undertaken the same ... because they trust rather\r\n    to their judgment than their art, and to their eye than their\r\n    scale and compass.’[837]\r\n\r\nHe says that they are too high out of the water, crank, and cannot carry\r\ntheir canvas or work their guns in a seaway; that they will not steer,\r\nand sometimes ‘their sides are not of equal proportion the one to the\r\nother,’ Waymouth, among other improvements, suggested a turret on the\r\nupper deck, moving on swivel and armed with ‘murtherers.’ In another\r\npaper he says that ‘the shipwrights of England and Christendom build\r\nships only by uncertain and traditional precepts and by deceiving aim\r\nof their eye,’ and the resulting vessels, ‘cannot bear sail nor steer\r\nreadily ... for want of art in proportioning of the mould and fitting of\r\nthe masts and tackling.’[838]\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be borne in mind that for at least a quarter of a\r\ncentury English men-of-war had outsailed their antagonists, had weathered\r\ngales and fought actions, just as successfully as though they had been\r\nbuilt on the most scientific modern principles. Waymouth himself was\r\nnot successful as a commander at sea; perhaps he knew too much. But he\r\nwas not alone in his criticisms. Ralegh, in his ‘Observations on the\r\nNavy,’ addressed to Prince Henry, says that there are six principal\r\nthings required in a man-of-war, viz.: that she should be strongly built,\r\nswift, stout-sided, carry out her guns in all weathers, lie-to in a\r\ngale easily, and stay well. None of these things did the King’s ships\r\ndo satisfactorily and ‘it were also behoofeful that his Majesty’s ships\r\nwere not so overpestered and clogged with great ordnance ... so that\r\nmuch of it serves to no better use but only to labour and overcharge\r\nthe ship’s sides.’ As a practical illustration of the shipwrights’\r\nloose methods of calculation it may be mentioned that when the _Prince\r\nRoyal_, the largest vessel of the reign, was built, Phineas Pett and\r\nBright estimated that 775 loads of timber would be required, whereas 1627\r\nloads were actually used, and the general increase in her cost by this\r\nerror of judgment was £5908.[839] These laments did not lead to any\r\ngreat improvements in construction. Only a few of the vessels were in\r\nany way sheathed; in 1624 Dutch men-of-war could, literally, sail round\r\nEnglish ones,[840] and their crankness was only imperfectly remedied by\r\nfurring or girdling,[841] a method says the writer of the _Nomenclator\r\nNavalis_,[842] which is ‘a loss to owners and disgrace to builders and\r\ndeserves punishment.... In all the world there is not so many furred as\r\nin England.’ That the advance was slow may be judged from the fact that\r\nin 1635 the _Merhonour_ of 1589, and rebuilt in 1613, was still regarded\r\nas one of the fastest sailers in the Navy. The desire for more scientific\r\nconstruction and the growing importance of the shipbuilding industry may\r\nhowever be inferred from the incorporation of the Shipwrights’ Company\r\nin 1605. The association had existed as a fraternity from, at least, the\r\nfifteenth century, and was now of sufficient consequence to obtain a\r\ncharter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Seamen.]\r\n\r\nAn onlooker[843] said that the English were ‘good sailors and better\r\npirates.’ Whatever their quality as seamen, or however doubtful their\r\nmaritime morality, no greater care was taken now to preserve their health\r\nor improve their morals than had formerly been the case. It is true that\r\nthe first article in every commission laid stress on the performance of\r\ndivine service at least twice a day, while the singing of psalms at a\r\nchange of watch was an old custom, but such humanising details as the\r\npunctual payment of wages,[844] a supply of eatable provisions, hospitals\r\nfor the sick, and suitable clothes, had not yet recommended themselves to\r\nthe authorities as modes either of obtaining men or of keeping them in\r\nthe service. Ralegh writes, ‘They go with as great a grudging to serve\r\nin his Majesty’s ships as if it were to be slaves in the galleys.’ James\r\nI made no use of the Navy beyond fitting out the Algiers expedition\r\nof 1620, and commissioning a few ships, year by year, to serve in the\r\nnarrow seas; but for these few vessels it was found equally difficult to\r\nobtain men and to retain them when caught, now that the incitements of\r\nSpanish prizes were wanting, while the mortality afloat was equal to that\r\nof the worst days of Elizabeth. The only occasion when a large number\r\nof men were required was for the fleet preparing in 1625, before the\r\ndeath of James, and then the Navy Commissioners wrote to Buckingham that\r\n‘the pressed men run away as fast as we send them down.’[845] Captain\r\nChristian of the _Bonaventure_, almost a new ship, serving on the east\r\ncoast, in 1623, wrote of ‘the weak, and I may truly say miserable state\r\nof this ship ... of 160 men there are but 70 persons of all sorts that at\r\npresent is either fit or able to do the least labour in the ship.’[846]\r\nThere was also a great infection and mortality on board the _Garland_.\r\nCaptain Christian complains too of the quality of the men pressed; ‘of\r\nall the whole company when they are at the best there are not twenty\r\nhelmsmen and but three that can heave a lead.’\r\n\r\nThese instances belong to the end of the reign but matters had not\r\nchanged: they had only continued. In 1608 it was said that ‘the navy\r\nis for the greatest part manned with aged, impotent, vagrant, lewd,\r\nand disorderly companions; it is become a ragged regiment of common\r\nrogues.’[847] In the Algiers fleet one ship put ashore ninety-two sick\r\nmen at Malaga at one time. A hospital ship, the _Goodwill_, accompanied\r\nthis fleet but she was afterwards ‘commanded for other purposes’ and the\r\ninvalids thrust ashore on the cold charity to be found in a Spanish port.\r\nBut of course statistics of sickness and death are everywhere rarely\r\nreferred to in comparison with salutes, state visits, and other affairs\r\nof personal dignity.\r\n\r\nAlthough the sailor was not properly fed and paid even if he behaved\r\nwell, he suffered sufficiently severe penalties for bad conduct. Flogging\r\nwas so common that ‘some sailors do believe in good earnest that they\r\nshall never have a fair wind until the poor boys be duly ... whipped\r\nevery Monday morning.’ Ducking, keelhauling, tongue-scraping, and tying\r\nup with weights hung round the neck ’till heart and back be ready to\r\nbreak’ were common punishments. ‘These will tame the most rude and\r\nsavage people in the world,’ says Monson. If these punishments were\r\nolder than Elizabeth they were semi-illegal customs and if connived at\r\nwere not publicly recognised. They were now part of ordinary discipline\r\nand mark the downward progress of the sailor in self-respect and social\r\nestimation. They were easier and cheaper to apply than good government\r\nbut they bore their Nemesis in the next reign. The old custom of\r\nlashing to the bowsprit a sailor who had four times slept on watch,\r\nand letting him drown or starve still existed.[848] Small wonder that\r\nthe men ‘abhorred’[849] the employment of the crown, and that in 1625\r\nthe shipkeepers at Chatham included weavers, barbers, tailors, bakers,\r\nshoemakers, etc., ‘most of whom had never been to sea.’[850]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Administration:—The Navy Officers.]\r\n\r\nThe disorganisation of a service commonly presses most hardly on its\r\nweakest members; those of higher rank have usually sufficient influence\r\nto preserve their rights or, if unscrupulous, to help themselves to\r\nunlicensed gains in the general scramble. Nottingham was still at\r\nthe head of the Navy as Lord Admiral, a post he retained till 1618.\r\nEnglishmen will always remember him with respect as the commander\r\nof 1588, but a perusal of the various papers relating to the naval\r\nadministration of this period compels one to conclude that while\r\nalways ready to do his duty _en grand seigneur_, to command fleets,\r\nand to accept responsibility and decide when referred to, he took but\r\na fingertip interest in those details of which successful organisation\r\nconsists, while his implicit confidence in his subordinates was a\r\ndisastrous weakness. Moreover he was now growing very old and had\r\ndoubtless lost much of his former clearness of mental vision. During\r\nthe lifetime of Hawkyns and under the keen supervision of the Queen and\r\nher ministers this neglect mattered little, but from 1596 onwards the\r\nconduct of the Navy Office degenerated rapidly. Langford had possessed no\r\nauthority and Grevill, if weak, had not been Navy Treasurer long enough\r\nto do much good or harm, although signs were not wanting during the\r\nclosing years of Elizabeth’s life that the able control that had made the\r\nNavy so terrible to England’s foes was relaxing. But the appointment in\r\n1604[851] of Sir Robert Mansell was most unfortunate. Mansell, who was\r\nan indifferent seaman and an incapable and dishonest administrator, and\r\nwhose only claim to the place was his relationship to, and favour with,\r\nNottingham, remained in office until 1618, and the greater portion of\r\nthis section is practically a record of his unfitness for his important\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nUnder a different Treasurer the other officers might have performed\r\ntheir duty sufficiently well. As it was they fell in with the prevailing\r\nspirit. Trevor remained Surveyor until 1611 when he was replaced by Sir\r\nRichard Bingley and in the same year Sir Guildford Slingsby succeeded\r\nPalmer. In the victualling branch Marmaduke Darell, now a knight,\r\nsurrendered his former patent and received a fresh one, on 16th August\r\n1603, directed to him and Sir Thomas Bludder. As the fee still remained\r\nat its original £50 a year the profit came out of the provisions and\r\nwas unwillingly provided by the men. In 1612 this patent was in turn\r\nsurrendered and replaced by one of 31st January appointing Sir Allen\r\nApsley in conjunction with Darell. By this new patent all the storehouses\r\nand other buildings at Tower Hill, the dockyards, and elsewhere were\r\nhenceforth attached to the department; hitherto they had been held by\r\nthe crown and only lent at pleasure. Marmaduke Darell died in 1622, and\r\na new patent of 8th January 1623 nominated his son Sampson Darell to act\r\nwith Apsley. There was no change in the victualling rate until 1623, when\r\nit reached sevenpence halfpenny and eightpence, for harbour and sea rates\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nIn 1617, shortly before they were superseded, the functions of the\r\nofficers were thus defined. The Comptroller’s duties were to check the\r\naccounts of the Treasurer, and Surveyor of victualling, to inspect stores\r\nand storekeepers’ books. The Surveyor to inspect ship, wharves, houses,\r\nchain, and ships on return from sea, and draw out indents for ships’\r\nstores. The Clerk to keep minutes of resolutions and attend the yearly\r\ngeneral survey. The Treasurer’s duties were financial and involved a\r\ngeneral superintendence.[852]\r\n\r\nMansell’s delinquencies can be best treated separately, but both he and\r\nNottingham dealt liberally with officers employed at sea or ashore.\r\nNottingham himself obtained in 1609 and 1611 two pensions from James\r\nI, during the supremacy of the Howard faction with the king, amounting\r\ntogether to £2700 a year; and it is characteristic of James that\r\nthe larger of these pensions, of £1700 a year, was granted when the\r\ncommission of 1608 was sitting and when its disclosures must have been\r\nwell known. As though all ranks knew what was coming the festivities\r\ncommenced with the death of Elizabeth. High festival was held on the\r\nships and the pursers petitioned for an allowance of £200, being the\r\ncost of general entertainment given by the captains for a month to all\r\nwho came on board.[853] When Mansell went to sea, he gave himself, as\r\nrear-admiral, thirty shillings a day, although Sir Fulke Grevill, when\r\ndischarging the same office in 1599, received only sixteen and eightpence\r\na day. Admirals were appointed for the north, south, east, and west\r\ncoasts, for the narrow seas, and for Ireland, all at liberal rates of\r\npay. In one year, when only seven ships were in commission, there were\r\nthree admirals and four vice-admirals serving, ‘so that the navy was like\r\nan army of generals and colonels.’[854] In 1602, with twenty-six vessels\r\nat sea the pay of the superior officers was less than during any one of\r\nthe four or five years before the storm burst on Mansell and Nottingham\r\nin 1618. Again, ‘we find ... that these admirals and vice-admirals with\r\ntheir twenty shillings and ten shillings per diem, together with the\r\nallowance of their retinue and other advantages, are ... so contented\r\non land that they cannot brook the seas and get captains under them as\r\nsubstitutes in their absence.’[855]\r\n\r\nLavish travelling expenses were allowed, and even some of the inferior\r\nofficers were generously permitted to benefit by the stream of wealth\r\ncirculating among the higher officials. Worn out ships were put in\r\ncommission both to use up stores and to provide appointments for the\r\ndependants of those in place; the only result being that they lay in\r\nharbour as a ‘safe sanctuary for loose persons.’ The cost of piloting the\r\nthirteen ships which took the Princess Elizabeth over to Flushing was\r\n£208, and thereon it is remarked that the whole piloting charges for 286\r\nships during the last five years of Elizabeth did not amount to more. The\r\nComptroller of the Navy, when he went from London to Chatham, charged £9,\r\n9s 11d for travelling expenses, and the Surveyor required £19, 16s for\r\nthe same journey, ‘it being the duty of his place,’ the Commissioners\r\nindignantly annotate, while even a deputy took £8 or £10 when he went.\r\nMansell himself was almost sublime; he afterwards claimed £10,000 for\r\ntravelling expenses during his term of office.[856] New posts were\r\nfreely created and equally freely paid. Besides the various admirals who\r\ndid nothing, there were a captain-general and two vice-admirals of the\r\nnarrow seas, a storekeeper at Woolwich at £54, ‘while the store not worth\r\nforty shillings,’ and a surveyor of tonnage whose duty it was to survey\r\nmerchant ships of 100 tons and upwards claiming the bounty, and who was\r\naccused on all sides of embezzling half the sums paid by the crown to the\r\nmerchants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Administration:—Sir Robert Mansell.]\r\n\r\nWhen Mansell resigned, he sent in to the Commissioners of 1618, only an\r\nuncertified abstract of his payments for the preceding five years. The\r\nCommissioners remarked that ‘they being noways vouched or subscribed by\r\nthe officers we can give no satisfaction of the state of his accounts,\r\nbeing only his own assertions,’[857] and the criticism fairly generalises\r\nMansell’s system of financial control even where not tainted with\r\nabsolute fraud. Notwithstanding his defiance of the abortive order for\r\ninquiry issued in 1613, and his consequent temporary imprisonment, he was\r\nsufficiently in favour three years later to receive a present of £10,000\r\nfrom the king on the occasion of his marriage.[858] Proved dishonesty or\r\nincapacity barred no one from the favour of James I, provided the culprit\r\nwas sufficiently good-looking or had influential friends; and although\r\nthe evidence laid before the Commission of 1608 and the Commissioners’\r\nreport thereon should have amply sufficed to send Mansell to the Tower,\r\nhis ascendancy with Nottingham enabled him to continue in office for a\r\nfurther ten years. Shortly after his appointment he and Sir John Trevor,\r\nthe Surveyor of the Navy took steps to provide all the requisite stores\r\nthemselves, thus making large gains on the articles sold by them to the\r\nking, and in direct contempt of the rules made by Burleigh twenty years\r\nbefore. Not only was timber ordered three or four times over for the\r\nsame purpose,[859] but on that item alone Mansell was accused of making\r\na fraudulent profit of £5000 in some four years, and, in conjunction\r\nwith Sir John Trevor, of obtaining upwards of £7000 in the same time by\r\nthe differences between the prices paid for pitch, tar, masts, etc., and\r\nthose charged to the crown.[860] He, Pett, and Trevor, were joint owners\r\nof a ship built of government materials and furnished with government\r\nstores, which was hired to the king as a transport to go to Spain when\r\nNottingham went there as ambassador in 1605, and for which the State\r\npaid, but ‘the same ship was at that time employed in a merchant’s voyage\r\nand so entered in the custom-house books.’[861]\r\n\r\nHawkyns had introduced the practice of paying over money at once to\r\nmerchants supplying the various requisites for the Navy on deduction of\r\nthreepence in the pound, an allowance they were well pleased to make in\r\nview of the prompt payment, while he had to wait long for his accounts\r\nto be settled. Mansell still deducted the threepence but did not pay.\r\nHe stopped sixpence a month from the seamen’s wages for the Chatham\r\nChest, but ‘falls presently into raging passions and pangs when they call\r\nfor it.’[862] But Mansell was by no means the only one of the superior\r\nofficers who helped himself out of this fund. Charges of embezzlement,\r\nin its crudest form, were made against him in that he certified for\r\nmore wages than were actually paid—£1000 in one year alone—and that he\r\nretained the proceeds of such government stores as were sold.[863] It\r\nmust be remembered that these accusations were not anonymous attacks,\r\nsuch as were made against Hawkyns, but charges deliberately formulated\r\nby a court of inquiry which he never dared to face. It may be truer\r\nto say that he was indifferent; it is possible that a portion of his\r\nill-earned fortune went in purchasing immunity. And it is an argument in\r\nfavour of this view that his dismissal from office did not destroy his\r\ninfluence at court. He was chosen to command the expensive and resultless\r\nAlgiers expedition of 1620-21, and his subsequent disgrace was due to\r\ncauses independent of his failure as a seaman or his dishonesty as an\r\nadministrator.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Administration:—Abuses and Remedies.]\r\n\r\nNorreys, writing to Sir John Coke about the Navy in 1603, says ‘To say\r\ntruth the whole body is so corrupted as there is no sound part almost\r\nfrom the head to the foot; the great ones feed on the less and enforce\r\nthem to steal both for themselves and their commanders.’[864] Abuses\r\nunknown during the lifetime of Hawkyns had sprung into existence shortly\r\nafter his death, although they might have been then easily checked had\r\nGrevill been succeeded by one determined to destroy them. Delay in\r\npaying off ships, to the discontent of the men and extra expense of the\r\ngovernment, combinations between captains, pursers, and victuallers\r\nto return false musters, and the practice of selling appointments to\r\nminor posts were all, according to reliable evidence begun about 1597\r\nor 1598.[865] We know that theft was prevalent enough under Elizabeth,\r\nbut it occurred in the shape of peddling offences, committed by the\r\ndelinquents at their peril, that the authorities did their best to crush,\r\ninstead of an organised system in which the latter took the lion’s share.\r\nUnder James ‘the chief Officers bear themselves insolently, depending on\r\npowerful friends at court;’ and ‘the shipwrights and others are ordered,\r\ncommanded, and countermanded in their work by chief Officers who know\r\nnothing about it, so that the meanest merchantman is better rigged\r\nand canvassed than the royal ships.’ The insolence and ignorance here\r\ndescribed speak of conditions very different from those that had obtained\r\nunder the iron hand of Elizabeth. In 1608 the scandal caused by these\r\nand other circumstances was so great as to compel inquiry, whether the\r\ndetermining cause was the contrivance of Sir Robert Cotton or of others.\r\nA commission was issued to the Earls of Nottingham and Northampton, Lord\r\nZouch, Sir Ed. Wotton, Sir Julius Cæsar, Cotton, and others, of whom\r\nonly Nottingham was an experienced seaman, and he never attended their\r\nmeetings.[866] The sittings of the commission extended from May 1608\r\nuntil June 1609; they commenced with an ‘elegant’ speech from the Earl of\r\nNorthampton, a voluminous report was compiled, and the only punishment\r\nthe culprits experienced was that of suffering ‘an oration’ from James,\r\nin which he trusted that the guilty persons would behave better in\r\nfuture, and with that patient and saintly hope the proceedings ended. How\r\nsome of his hearers must have longed for one hour of the dead Queen.\r\n\r\nAmong the malpractices examined into at some length by the commissioners\r\nwas the sale and purchase of places, already referred to. Hugh Lidyard\r\nwas made clerk of the checque at Woolwich by Sir John Trevor, for which\r\nhe was to pay Trevor £20 yearly and a hogshead of wine; another witness\r\ndeposed that ‘of late years the general way of preferment is by money and\r\nfew that he knoweth ... come freely to their places.’ Pursers paid from\r\n£70 to £120 for their posts, boatswains £20, and cooks £30. Robert Hooker\r\ngave Edward Masters, of Nottingham’s household, £130 for the pursership\r\nof the _Repulse_, this he sold for the same amount and bought that of\r\nthe _Quittance_ for £100. His profit he made by victualling the men for\r\nsixpence a day, and he admitted that at least ten more men were carried\r\non the books than were on board. Naturally, as promotion went by length\r\nof purse,\r\n\r\n    ‘the officers put in and keep in whom they list though they be\r\n    never so unfit, and put out whom they list though never so fit,\r\n    and woe be to him that taketh exception to any man though he\r\n    be never so unruly ... it breaketh the hearts of them that are\r\n    worthy.’\r\n\r\nIt was equally natural that men who had paid heavily for their\r\nemployments were unscrupulous in recouping themselves. ‘The captains\r\nbeing for the most part poor gentlemen did mend their fortunes by\r\ncombining with the pursers,’ who were in league with the victuallers to\r\nsend in returns of more men than were on board the ships. Boatswains\r\nand gunners sold their stores, shipwrights stole timber, and captains\r\nsheltered and took bribes from pirates, or turned their vessels into\r\nmerchantmen to enable owners of goods to evade payment of customs. The\r\nSurveyors of victualling were accused of overcharging and of frauds to at\r\nleast £4000, in four years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Reorganisation of 1618.]\r\n\r\nJames had every reason to sharply check the waste going on, for the crown\r\ndebt, which was only £400,000 at his accession, had mounted to £1,000,000\r\nin 1608, while the deficit in revenue was £70,000 a year.[867] But ‘an\r\noration’ in broad Scotch from the lips of the conceited pedant staggering\r\nunder the weight of the Tudor crown did not prove an effective method of\r\nreform. The old knaveries continued even as though James had not made a\r\nspeech. In 1613 Cotton attempted, through the intervention of Northampton\r\nand Rochester, to obtain another inquiry; but his efforts failed through\r\nthe influence of Nottingham and the intrigues of Mansell. In 1618\r\nthe naval administration was worse than ever, and other departments\r\nwere equally corrupt; ‘the household was one mass of peculation, and\r\nextravagance.’[868] Even now Sir Lionel Cranfield, who was the moving\r\nspirit in the endeavour to purify the public service, might have failed\r\nhad not Buckingham himself desired to occupy the post of Lord Admiral.\r\nNottingham at last retired with a gratuity of £3000 and another pension\r\nof £1000 a year. Mansell was succeeded, from the 10th May 1618, by Sir\r\nWilliam Russell, a merchant, who paid him for his place and who was\r\nwealthy enough to advance subsequently £30,000 towards fitting out the\r\nCadiz expedition of 1625.[869] It is probable that, from his lack of\r\ntechnical knowledge, Russell’s direction, if more honest than Mansell’s,\r\nwould have been as unsuccessful had he been entrusted with control, but\r\nhis duties were financial only and confined to the keeping of accounts.\r\nThe other officers were ‘sequestered from their posts’ and their business\r\nentrusted to a board of Navy Commissioners, appointed for five years\r\nand responsible to the Lord Admiral. Of the Commissioners, Sir John\r\nCoke was the leading spirit and received £300 a year; one was in charge\r\nof Chatham, with a salary of £200 a year; another, William Burrell,\r\na shipbuilder, was placed at Deptford to supervise all building and\r\nrepairs, for which he received £300 a year; and Thomas Norreys acted as\r\nSurveyor with £200 a year.[870] Immediate benefit was obtained from the\r\nreform; the fleet and dockyards were kept in repair, theft was checked,\r\nand two new ships a year were built in five consecutive years, all for\r\nless money than Mansell had squandered in doing nothing efficiently.\r\nBuckingham appears, also, to have not only given his subordinates a loyal\r\nsupport but to have been honestly anxious to obtain the best men for\r\nthe service, and to render officers and sailors contented. The chronic\r\nemptiness, however, of the treasury, for which he was largely answerable,\r\nmade his endeavours in this last direction of less avail.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Navy Commissioners.]\r\n\r\nThe new Commissioners,[871] on entering office, sent in a report\r\nof the state of affairs they found existing in the various naval\r\ndepartments;[872] all the frauds of 1608 were still flourishing, with\r\nsome new ones due to the lapse of time. Places were still sold, and\r\nat such high prices that the buyers ‘profess openly that they cannot\r\nlive unless they may steal’; the cost of the Navy had of late been some\r\n£53,000 a year, ‘that could not keep it from decay.’ For building a new\r\nship in place of the _Bonaventure_ £5700 had been allowed but, although\r\n£1700 had been paid on account of it, no new vessel had been commenced,\r\nand though this same ship ‘was broken up above seven years past yet the\r\nKing hath paid £63 yearly for keeping her.’ Further, ‘the _Advantage_ was\r\nburnt about five years since and yet keepeth at the charge of £104, 9s\r\n5d; the _Charles_ was disposed of in Scotland two years since and costeth\r\n£60, 16s 10d for keeping.’ For repairing the _Merhonour_, _Defiance_,\r\n_Vanguard_, and _Dreadnought_, £23,500 had been paid\r\n\r\n    ‘for which eight new ships might have been built as the\r\n    accounts of the East India Company do prove; yet all this while\r\n    the King’s ships decayed and if the _Merhonour_ were repaired\r\n    she was left so imperfect that before her finishing she begins\r\n    again to decay.’\r\n\r\nIn nine years £108,000 had been charged for cordage, and the\r\nCommissioners express their intention of reducing the expenditure on this\r\nitem by two-thirds.\r\n\r\nAt a later date some of the Commissioners themselves did not escape\r\nsuspicion. In 1623 Sir John Coke, still the leading member, wrote to\r\nConway that all went well until the Algiers voyage, but that he then\r\nsuspected that some of his colleagues were selling their own wares to the\r\ngovernment. They, of course, denied the allegation when Coke was frank\r\nenough to openly tax them with it, but ‘ever since I carried a watchful\r\neye over them and employed fit persons to discover their dealings.’[873]\r\nA man like Coke was probably not popular even among those with whom he\r\nwas associated, still less with the gang whose deceits and illicit gains\r\nhe had greatly helped to terminate. We may read something of the temper\r\nand feelings of the discarded Navy Officers in his appeal for protection\r\nagainst Sir Guilford Slingsby, a year later, who had threatened that,\r\nunless he was restored to office by Lady day, Coke should not outlive\r\nthat date.[874] Slingsby was reappointed Comptroller by Charles I and\r\nthen again gave evidence of his peculiar qualifications for the exercise\r\nof authority over others. But there is no doubt that the administration\r\nof the Commissioners was pure enough compared with that of Mansell. Their\r\nfailures were due to causes they were unable to deal with, such as want\r\nof money and the bad treatment of the men. So far as the latter were\r\nconcerned the Commissioners did not—and probably had no power to—reverse\r\nthe disposition to employ landsmen of influence as captains who were\r\nout of sympathy with their men and had no care for their feelings or\r\ninterests. It was in this and the succeeding reign that there grew up\r\nthat bitter hatred and contempt for gentlemen captains, to which seamen\r\nso often gave expression for a century afterwards, and of which traces\r\nare to be found in the present century.\r\n\r\nAt the close of their first five years of office the Commissioners sent\r\nin a report of the work done by them.[875] They said that whereas they\r\nfound in 1618 twenty-three serviceable and ten unserviceable ships, of\r\naltogether 15,670 tons, four decayed galleys and four hoys, costing\r\n£53,000 a year, they have now thirty-five serviceable vessels of 19,339\r\ntons, besides the hoys and galleys, and the expense has been little more\r\nthan £30,000 a year, including the charges for building ten new ships.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Naval Expenditure.]\r\n\r\nThis last amount does not coincide with those given in the table below,\r\nfrom the _Pipe Office Accounts_, but that may be from the inclusion\r\nin the latter of extraneous expenses, such as the Algiers expedition,\r\nconsidered by the Commissioners to be outside the range of their\r\ncomparison:—[876]\r\n\r\n  +----+--------+-------+-----------+-----------+------+----------+-------+\r\n  |    | Amount |Victua-|    Sea    |  Total    |Stores|Ordinary  |Extra- |\r\n  |    |received| lling |  Charges  |  spent    |      |          ordinary|\r\n  +----+--------+-------+-----------+-----------+------+----------+-------+\r\n  |1603| £42619 |£32920 |£13247     |£42271     |      |          |       |\r\n  |1604|  24000 | 12469 |  6248     | 24002     |£9616 |£6789     |       |\r\n  |1605|  29000 | 16042 |  9760     | 28672     | 7312 |          |£22493 |\r\n  |1606|  22100 | 10156 |           | 18984     |      |          |       |\r\n  |1607|  21000 |  9452 |  2896     | 25200     |11000 | 5242     | 19900 |\r\n  |1608|  38424 | 12103 |  6859     | 36554     |      |          |       |\r\n  |1609|  42400 | 10200 |           | 43396     |      |          |       |\r\n  |1610|  36607 | 10432 |           | 36358     |      |          |       |\r\n  |1611|  42300 |  8670 |  3428     | 40153     |25520 | 8143     | 31921 |\r\n  |1612|  34200 |  8672 |  3934     | 33930     |      | 8867     |       |\r\n  |1613|  50355 | 19625 |  8814     | 55987[877]|25000 |10100     | 45786 |\r\n  |1614|  48463 | 15275 |  7996     | 56848     |      |          |       |\r\n  |1615|  45643 | 15387 |  7764     | 57968     |16295 | 8313     |       |\r\n  |1616|  40515 | 12886 |  7800     | 41269     |15268 | 4625     |       |\r\n  |1617|  31213 | 13716 |           | 25548     |      |          |       |\r\n  |1618|        | 10465 |  5165     | 27489     | 8000 |          |       |\r\n  |1619|  31606 |  6324 |           | 32610     | 2355 | 5789     |       |\r\n  |1620|  38300 | 14680 |  2960[878]| 35872     | 5936 |          |       |\r\n  |1621|  54264 | 23369 |  2945[879]| 51000     |      |10723     |       |\r\n  |1622|  52385 | 11143 |  7765     | 45450     |      |13011[880]|       |\r\n  |1623|  59200 | 23414 | 24000     | 62000[881]|      |          |       |\r\n  |1624|  26529 |  6430 |  3079     | 31125     |      |          |       |\r\n  +----+--------+-------+-----------+-----------+------+----------+-------+\r\n\r\nSeamen’s wages remained unchanged till the end of the reign when the\r\nrate reached fourteen shillings a month, and the pay of the officers\r\nwas raised in 1618. Not only was it difficult to keep the men on board\r\nthe ships, but the expensive and wasteful system of impressment made\r\nthe eventual outlay even heavier. In 1624 an estimate was drawn up of\r\nthe expenses for fitting out a fleet of twelve men-of-war: 3000 men\r\nwere required, of which number the river was to supply 800 at press and\r\nconduct money of 2s 6d a man, the remaining 2200 being obtained from\r\n‘remote places’ at a cost of eight shillings a man. At their discharge\r\none shilling and seven shillings a man conduct money respectively, for\r\nthe river and country districts would again have to be paid. The total\r\nestimate for twelve men-of-war for five months, and fifty merchantmen for\r\nsix months, was, £94,874, a sum which shows the great increase in prices\r\nsince the days of Elizabeth, and partly explains the rise in the yearly\r\nexpenditure.[882]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Piracy.]\r\n\r\nPiracy, though still a school for seamanship, was no longer the\r\nflourishing business it had been under Elizabeth; the trade, to use a\r\nmodern phrase, was ‘cut up.’ Spanish commerce was almost destroyed in\r\nnorthern latitudes, and the Dutch was well able to protect itself, while\r\nnew competitors were found in the Mediterranean rovers who hovered round\r\nthe English coasts and even stretched out into the North Atlantic, and in\r\nthe fast sailing Dunkirk privateers who swarmed in the Channel. In 1605\r\nHannibal Vivian wrote from the west country, ‘let it not offend you that\r\nI inform you from time to time of the piracies and depredations daily\r\ncommitted on this coast.’ However repugnant piracy may have been to some\r\nof the officials it commended itself still to many natives of the western\r\ncounties. Out of one pirate crew, thirty-five in number, seventeen\r\nbelonged to Dartmouth and Kingswear, and the mayor and others of Plymouth\r\nwere accused of buying the stolen goods and favouring the escape of the\r\nmen. The government appeared helpless; if they sent ships to sea the\r\ncaptains ‘pretend to pursue, and when well away in some distant port\r\nwrite up that a leak had been sprung, obtain warrants to repair in port,\r\nand so remain for the captain’s benefit.’ Sometimes they even took the\r\npirates’ goods on board and sheltered the criminals themselves. If any\r\nof the corsairs were caught the general opinion among them that they\r\nwere only liable ‘to a little lazy imprisonment,’ was usually justified\r\nby results. Ireland was said to be ‘the nursery and storehouse of\r\npirates,’[883] for, besides providing its own quota of sea-rovers it\r\noffered the hospitality of its ports to those vessels belonging to the\r\nBarbary corsairs that required repair.[884]\r\n\r\nIn 1616 the weakness of the Crown was shown by a warrant being granted\r\nto two London merchants to prepare a ship to go pirate hunting with\r\npermission to retain for themselves three-fourths of the goods\r\nseized.[885] About this time there was a fleet of thirty Turkish ships\r\nin the Atlantic, and another Salleeman had recently been captured in\r\nthe Thames;[886] between 1609 and 1616 the Algerines had captured 466\r\nBritish ships and reduced their crews to slavery,[887] and in the latter\r\nyear Sir Francis Cottington wrote to Buckingham that their strength\r\nand boldness exceeded all previous experience. Mansell’s voyage of\r\n1620-21 cost at least £34,000, and probably much more, but ‘such was the\r\nmisgovernment of those ships,’[888] that within a few weeks of his return\r\nan Algerine fleet was at work again in the narrow seas. The inhabitants\r\nof Swanage seem to have been especially nervous since they petition\r\nfor a block-house, ‘the Turks being grown exceedingly audacious.’\r\nMatters grew even worse towards the close of the reign. Some Weymouth\r\nmerchants desired to fit out ships of their own to deal with the incubus\r\nterrorising commerce, but permission was refused, mainly because it was\r\ninjurious to the Lord Admiral’s profits and ‘dishonourable to the King.’\r\nOthers, however, of the Weymouth tradesmen dealt with the robbers, and\r\nthe local Admiralty officers were supposed to connive at the traffic.[889]\r\n\r\nThe Lizard light was objected to because ‘it will conduct pirates,’ and\r\nto most people it will read strangely now that it was forbidden at the\r\ninstance of the Trinity Corporation. The Newfoundland Company, in asking\r\nfor assistance, said that since 1612 damage to the amount of £40,000 had\r\nbeen committed by the marauders, and that over 1000 men had been forced\r\nor persuaded to join them.[890] One of the freebooters was admiral of\r\na large pirate fleet. In 1624 the Navy Commissioners were desired to\r\ncertify how many men-of-war would be required to clear the southern and\r\nwestern coasts, just as they had often enough before been required to\r\ncertify; the process seldom proceeded further.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Merchant Marine.]\r\n\r\nThat ‘merchantmen dare hardly sail’ was scarcely a condition of things\r\nconducive to commercial enterprise. Piracy was becoming a more serious\r\ndrawback than formerly because ships were bigger and more costly, the\r\nnetwork of commerce more sensitive and complex, and losses could no\r\nlonger be recouped by successful privateering on a small scale. Little\r\ncan be said of the merchant shipping of these years, as the returns of\r\navailable ships, so frequently occurring among the Elizabethan papers,\r\nare entirely absent for this period. But all the notices of trade met\r\nwith, are invariably characterised by lamentation. The Dutch were said\r\nto be obtaining the carrying trade owing to the greater cheapness with\r\nwhich their vessels were built and worked, the difference in their favour\r\nbeing as much as one-third of the English owner’s demand for freight.\r\nIn 1620 it was stated that the number of London-owned ships had fallen\r\nto one-half of that of former years, and, as accounting for part of the\r\ndecrease, we have a certificate for 1618 of vessels belonging to the\r\nriver but lately sold for want of employment.[891] The list in question\r\nshows an enormous depreciation in value, since none of them could have\r\nbeen very old:—\r\n\r\n  +-----------------+----+----+------+--------+\r\n  |                 |Tons|Guns| Cost |Sold for|\r\n  |                 |    |    |  £   |  £     |\r\n  |                 +----+----+------+--------+\r\n  |_Neptune_        | 500| 30 | 5000 |  1500  |\r\n  |_Paragon_        | 280| 24 | 3200 |  1000  |\r\n  |_Martha_         | 250| 20 | 2400 |  500   |\r\n  |_Industry_       | 350| 26 | 4500 |  2000  |\r\n  |_Clement and Job_| 300| 24 | 3600 |  1000  |\r\n  +-----------------+----+----+------+--------+\r\n\r\nThe building price here almost certainly does not include the cost of\r\nordnance, while it is probable that the sale price does, and it will\r\nbe noticed that these merchantmen are nearly as strongly armed as\r\nmen-of-war. Complaints came from all quarters: the Muscovy Company had\r\nemployment for only two instead of seventeen ships, as in former days,\r\nand the Norway trade was ‘in pawn to the Dutch’; the Levant Company found\r\nits trade destroyed by piracy, and still more by the competition of the\r\nDutch, who now sent one hundred ships a year to the Mediterranean. The\r\ngreater portion of the Newcastle coal traffic was carried on in foreign\r\nbottoms; there were some twenty vessels trading to Spain and Portugal,\r\nand fifty or sixty to the North German ports, but in both cases the Dutch\r\ntrade was now far greater than ours; and the fisheries in English waters\r\nwere entirely in the hands of the Hollanders who were reputed to make a\r\nprofit of £1,000,000 a year from that which under a stronger sovereign\r\nwould have been held for England. The Newfoundland and Iceland fisheries,\r\nwhich employed 150 and 120 sail respectively, were still chiefly in\r\nEnglish hands, but the Greenland, to which fifteen sail were sent, had to\r\nface the ubiquitous Dutch competitor.[892]\r\n\r\nDuring this reign the most flourishing association was the East India\r\nCompany, although its profits were not so large as were those of its\r\nDutch rival.[893] In twenty years it had despatched eighty-six ships,\r\nof which eleven had been seized by the Dutch, and fourteen had been\r\nwrecked or worn out, and the estimation in which it was held is shown\r\nby its being more heavily assessed towards the expenses of the Algiers\r\nexpedition than was any other company. This association attempted, in\r\n1613, to start iron and shipbuilding works near Cork, but was forced,\r\nby the hostility of the natives, to discontinue the enterprise. The\r\nlargest merchantman built during the reign of James, the _Trade’s\r\nIncrease_ of 1100 tons, was constructed for the East India Company.\r\nWith a smaller ship, the _Peppercorn_ of 250 tons, it was launched in\r\nJanuary 1610, and there are some curious notes by the captain of the\r\n_Peppercorn_ describing the event.[894] On Saturday, 30th December the\r\nking came down to name the two ships, but every attempt to launch them\r\nfailed, and continued efforts on the Sunday, ‘God made fruitless that\r\nday.’ On 1st Jan. the _Peppercorn_ was launched, and it was only then\r\nfound that the dockhead was too narrow to let the _Trade’s Increase_\r\npass. On the Wednesday, however, she was got clear and the captain of the\r\n_Peppercorn_ complains that ‘on this ship was all the Company’s pride\r\nset; she was altogether regarded, tended and followed while the other,\r\nthe _Peppercorn_ was left in manner desolate.’ The _Trades Increase_\r\nwas wrecked in 1613 on her first voyage. The hire of merchantmen taken\r\nup for government service was still two shillings a month per ton; and\r\nthe bounty of five shillings a ton on new and suitable vessels ceased in\r\n1624, only to be renewed early in the next reign for similar ships.\r\n\r\nMerchants, generally, were liable to the exactions and dishonesty of the\r\nofficials of the Customs department as much as in the previous reign. But\r\nby this time the two formerly antagonistic interests seem to have come to\r\na working arrangement. We are told that merchants and the farmers of the\r\ncustoms were now in partnership, and that goods were cleared on payment\r\nof little or no duty. The importation or exportation of prohibited wares\r\nwas only a matter of terms; and, altogether, the king was frequently\r\ndefrauded of 75% of the customs.[895] The collection of light dues was\r\nplaced in the hands of the customs’ farmers, and, when a licence to build\r\na lighthouse at Dungeness was granted to Sir Edward Howard in 1615, they\r\nhad to receive the one penny a ton payable from all ships passing it.\r\nAt Winterton there was also another light, and the receipts were £1000,\r\nof which, £350 went in expenses.[896] As the Trinity House claimed the\r\ncontrol of the coast lights as a part of its privileges, there was a good\r\ndeal of litigation on the subject during the reign.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Navy List.]\r\n\r\nIn the following list[897] certain vessels, the _Defiance_,\r\n_Dreadnought_, _Merhonour_, and _Repulse_ have been admitted as rebuilt\r\nand new, although it is quite possible that, notwithstanding the large\r\nsums spent upon them, they were only more or less badly repaired.\r\n\r\n  +----------------------+-----+-----+------+-------+----+----+-----+-----+\r\n  |                      |Built| Re- |Burden|Ton and|Guns|Keel|Beam |Depth|\r\n  |                      |     |built|      |Tonnage|    | ft.| ft. | ft. |\r\n  |                      +-----+-----+------+-------+----+----+-----+-----+\r\n  |_Nonsuch_[898]        |     | 1603|      |  636  | 38 |  88|34   | 15  |\r\n  |_Assurance_[899]      |     | 1603|      |  600  | 38 |  95|33   | 14.6|\r\n  |_Speedwell_[900]      |     | 1607|      |  400  |    |    |     |     |\r\n  |_Anne Royal_[901]     |     | 1608|      |  800  | 44 | 103|37   | 16  |\r\n  |_Lion’s Whelp_        |     | 1608|      |   90  |    |    |     |     |\r\n  |_Red Lion_[902]       |     | 1609|      |  650  | 38 |  91|35.2 | 16  |\r\n  |_Due Repulse_         |     | 1610|      |  700  | 40 |  97|37   | 15  |\r\n  |_Prince Royal_        | 1610|     |      | 1200  | 55 | 115|43.6 | 18  |\r\n  |_Phœnix_              | 1612|     |      |  250  | 20 |  70|24   | 11  |\r\n  |_Primrose_            |     | 1612|      |       |    |    |     |     |\r\n  |_Merhonour_[903]      |     | 1612|      |  800  | 44 | 104|38   | 17  |\r\n  |_Dreadnought_         |     | 1612|      |  450  | 32 |  84|31   | 13  |\r\n  |_Defiance_            |     | 1612|      |  700  | 40 |  97|37   | 15  |\r\n  |_Vanguard_            |     | 1615|      |  650  | 40 | 102|35   | 14  |\r\n  |_Seven Stars_         | 1615|     |      |  140  | 14 |  60|20   |  9  |\r\n  |_Convertine_[904]     | 1616|     |      |  500  | 34 |    |     |     |\r\n  |_Desire_              | 1616|     |      |   80  |  6 |  66|16   |  6  |\r\n  |_Rainbow_[905]        |     | 1618|      |  650  | 40 | 102|35   | 14  |\r\n  |_Antelope_            |     | 1618|      |  450  | 34 |  92|32   | 12.6|\r\n  |_Happy Entrance_      | 1619|     |  437 |  582  | 32 |  96|32.6 | 14  |\r\n  |_Constant Reformation_| 1619|     |  564 |  752  | 42 | 106|35.6 | 15  |\r\n  |_Victory_             | 1620|     |  656 |  875  | 42 | 108|35.9 | 17  |\r\n  |_Garland_             | 1620|     |  512 |  683  | 34 |  93|33   | 16  |\r\n  |_Swiftsure_           | 1621|     |  650 |  887  | 42 | 106|36.10| 16.8|\r\n  |_Bonaventure_         | 1621|     |  506 |  675  | 34 |  98|33   | 15.8|\r\n  |_St George_           | 1622|     |  671 |  895  | 42 | 110|37   | 16.6|\r\n  |_St Andrew_           | 1622|     |  671 |  895  | 42 | 110|37   | 16.6|\r\n  |_Triumph_             | 1623|     |  692 |  922  | 42 | 110|37   | 17  |\r\n  |_Mary Rose_           | 1623|     |  288 |  394  | 26 |  83|27   |     |\r\n  +----------------------+-----+-----+------+-------+----+----+-----+-----+\r\n\r\nTwo other third-rates, the _Mercury_ and _Spy_, were built in 1620 by\r\nPhineas Pett—who went as captain of one of them—for some London merchants\r\nto go with the Algiers fleet. By a warrant of August 1622 they were\r\nordered to be taken into the Navy, but their names do not appear in any\r\nlist of James or Charles.\r\n\r\nOf the nineteen vessels added to the Navy during Mansell’s term of office\r\ntwo were commenced before his appointment, one was bought, two of the\r\nfive new ones were mere pinnaces, and of the remainder most were very\r\nexpensive repairs rather than rebuildings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The New Ships.]\r\n\r\nIn 1603 James had resolved to have three ships built, but the _Nonsuch_\r\nand _Assurance_, both ordered before his accession, were the only quasi\r\nnew ones. Although no real accessions were made for some years James\r\ntook sufficient pride in his fleet to be eager to show it to visitors;\r\nin 1606 he ordered all the available vessels ‘to be rigged and put in\r\nwarlike order’ preparatory to a visit from himself and the King of\r\nDenmark, which took place in August. In 1610 the Prince of Brunswick\r\ncame to see the Navy. In 1608 the _Ark Royal_, Nottingham’s flagship in\r\n1588, was rebuilt, and her name which should have lived in popular memory\r\nwith that of the _Golden Hind_, changed to the _Anne Royal_, in honour\r\nof the commonplace Queen. She was rechristened by Sir Oliver Cromwell.\r\nThe _Swiftsure_, rebuilt and renamed the _Speedwell_, is noteworthy as\r\nbeing the first important English man-of-war lost by misadventure at sea\r\nsince the _Mary Rose_ foundered in 1545. She went ashore near Flushing\r\nin November 1624, a mischance that her captain—Chudleigh—attributed to\r\na drunken pilot.[906] He, at any rate, lost all control over his crew,\r\nwhose discipline seems to have been quite unequal to the sudden strain of\r\nan unexpected accident. Of Mansell’s rebuildings the most striking points\r\nare the amounts spent—nearly £60,000 can be traced in the _Pipe Office\r\nAccounts_—and the time taken, ships being usually two, three, or four\r\nyears in hand.\r\n\r\nIt was probably due to the express desire of James that on 20th October,\r\n1608 the keel was laid of the _Prince Royal_ of 1200 tons, the largest\r\nship yet designed for the Navy. Under the new rules of measurement in\r\nforce in 1632, she was certified as of 1035 net, and 1330 gross tonnage.\r\nHer construction was assigned to Phineas Pett, and many intrigues,\r\nreaching even the Court, centred round her. The other shipwrights were\r\nboth jealous and critical, and openly expressed their disapprobation\r\nboth of the material used and the manner in which it was employed. In\r\n1609, Baker, now an old man of seventy-nine years, but still in active\r\nemployment, William Bright, Edward Stevens, and some other shipwrights,\r\nwith Waymouth as an unofficial expert, were ordered to report on the\r\nexecution of the work. Pett did not like Waymouth, whom he describes in\r\nhis autobiography as ‘great kilcow Waymouth,’ and ‘a great braggadocio,\r\na vain and idle fellow.’ Baker, and perhaps some of the others must have\r\nbeen chosen on the governmental principle of setting personal enemies to\r\ninspect each other’s performances, seeing that he had not long before\r\nstated on oath that he thought both the Petts ‘simple’ and quite unfit\r\nto be entrusted with the production of a large ship.[907] Pett naturally\r\nhad little love for Baker, although he had years before attempted to be\r\nfriendly with the veteran, begging him not to so easily credit malicious\r\nreports, and ascribing all his knowledge of his art, ‘if I have any,’ to\r\nthe elder man.[908] But the system that made it to each man’s pecuniary\r\ninterest to obtain as many ships as possible to build and repair, and to\r\nexert all his personal influence to that end, converted the dockyards\r\ninto nests of intrigue.\r\n\r\nPett was protected by Nottingham and Mansell, and ‘he is reported to be\r\ntheir right hand and they cannot do without him,’ said Bright, another\r\nof Pett’s competitors, and who was therefore chosen to sit in judgment\r\nupon him. Nottingham, Suffolk and Worcester were then appointed to make\r\nfurther inquiry, and their report being satisfactory, and therefore\r\ndispleasing to Northampton, the latter desired another investigation,\r\nwhich the King acceded to by naming a day when he would examine the\r\nvessel and hear the conflicting evidence himself. He and Prince Henry\r\ncame to Woolwich on 8th May 1609, and after a long day of scrutiny and\r\ndiscussion, Pett emerged triumphant from the ordeal. Time, however, was\r\non the side of the objectors. The _Prince Royal_ was never subjected to\r\nany serious work, but in 1621 the Commissioners wrote to Buckingham that\r\nshe was then only fit for show, that she cost in the first instance,\r\n£20,000, and would require another £6000 to make her fit for service, and\r\nthat she was built of decaying timber and green unseasoned stuff.[909]\r\nThese were the very points on which Baker and his fellows had insisted,\r\nand on which they had been defeated in 1609. She attracted universal\r\nattention when building. The King, the Prince of Wales, Princess\r\nElizabeth, and the French ambassador came several times to visit her when\r\napproaching completion, and ‘nobles, gentry, and citizens from all parts\r\nof the country round,’ resorted to Woolwich. An attempt to launch her\r\nwas made on the 24th September 1610, the whole of the Royal family being\r\npresent, but, as in the case of the _Trades Increase_, the dockhead was\r\ntoo narrow to permit her to pass. A second essay was more successful.\r\n\r\nThe _Prince Royal_ was the first three-decker built for the English\r\nNavy.[910] She was gorgeously decorated, according to the taste of the\r\ntime, with carvings and ‘curious paintings, the like of which was never\r\nin any ship before.’ She was double-planked, ‘a charge which was not\r\nformerly thought upon, and all the butt-heads were double bolted with\r\niron bolts.’[911] There is one payment of £868 for her painting and\r\ngilding, work done by Robert Peake and Paul Isackson, the latter of whom\r\nbelonged to a family for several generations employed in decorating\r\nmen-of-war. The four upper strakes were ornamented with gilt and painted\r\nbadges, arms and ‘mask heads,’ and the Prince’s cabin was ‘very curiously\r\nwrought with divers histories.’ Carving cost £441, and included fourteen\r\n‘great lions’ heads for the round ports.’[912]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Commissioners’ Improvements.]\r\n\r\nIt was possibly the result of Cotton’s abortive effort in 1613 to procure\r\na further inquiry into the administration, that several of the old ships\r\nwere rebuilt about that time, but, as the Commissioners subsequently\r\nremarked, at prices that would have more than provided new ones in their\r\nstead. It was not until the Navy Commission took control in 1618 that the\r\nsystematic production of new ships was commenced. It will be seen from\r\nthe preceding list that from that date they carried out for five years\r\ntheir expressed intention of adding two ships a year to the Navy. They\r\nalso made certain recommendations, to be kept in view by themselves and\r\ntheir successors, that embodied improvements, perhaps the result of the\r\ntrenchant criticisms of the beginning of the reign.[913]\r\n\r\nThe fleet was to average thirty seagoing ships, and building was\r\nto be confined to Deptford, where two vessels could be worked upon\r\nsimultaneously. The length of keel was to be treble the breadth, ‘but not\r\nto draw above sixteen feet because deeper ships are seldom good sailors,’\r\nbesides, ‘they must be somewhat snug-built, without double galleries and\r\ntoo lofty upperworks, which overcharge many ships and make them loom\r\nfair but not work well at sea.’ It is no reproach to the Commissioners,\r\nwho could but act on the best professional advice obtainable, to have to\r\nremark that their ships were nearly as crank as their predecessors, and\r\nall required to be furred or girdled to make them at all trustworthy in a\r\nseaway; and at a later date, even the smaller stern galleries given them\r\nexcited much adverse criticism.\r\n\r\nThey continue,\r\n\r\n    ‘For strengthening the ship we subscribe to the new manner of\r\n    building—1st, making three orlops, whereof the lowest being\r\n    placed two feet under water, strengtheneth the ship though her\r\n    sides be shot through; 2nd, to carry this orlop end to end;\r\n    3rd, the second or main deck to be sufficiently high to work\r\n    guns in all weathers.’\r\n\r\nFrom this it is evident that the orlop deck as built in the _Merhonour_,\r\n_Garland_, and _Defiance_ of 1589 did not run the whole length of the\r\nship, and that if the ‘new manner’ is to be accepted literally, even the\r\n_Prince Royal_ was not a two-decker. Cooking galleys were to be placed in\r\nthe forecastle, as the weights carried at each end with a comparatively\r\nempty midship section caused ‘hogging,’ besides wasting valuable stowage\r\nspace and producing other inconveniences. Wynter had recommended this\r\nforty years before, but the new regulation remained inoperative for some\r\ntime longer. The lower ports were now to be at least four and a half feet\r\nabove the water line. Most of the Commissioners’ ships were built with\r\nthree decks, but with smaller and lower superstructures on the upper deck\r\nthan had been previously customary. Bad as they were they seem to have\r\nbeen steadier than their predecessors.\r\n\r\nAn undated State Paper, calendared under 1627, but which from its\r\narguments in favour of a third deck—a question finally closed long before\r\n1627—more probably belongs to this period, gives us some particulars of\r\nthe internal arrangements of a man-of-war. The lowest deck was to carry\r\nthe bread and other store-rooms, the cables and officers’ cabins, besides\r\na certain number of the crew who were also to be berthed upon it. The\r\nsecond deck was to be laid five and a half or six feet above this, and\r\nin a ship like the _Lion_ was to be pierced for nine ports a side, and\r\nfour chase-ports fore and aft. The ports were to be at least two feet\r\nthree inches square, ‘and that there be built between every two ports\r\nhanging cabins to fold up to the decks for the lodging of men.’ Otherwise\r\nthis deck was to be kept clear instead of being hampered by the cables\r\nstowed upon it in two-decked ships. Readers desirous of technical details\r\nrelating to the position and dimensions of floor, timbers, riders, butts,\r\ncarlings, clamps, foot and chain waling, standing and running rigging,\r\netc., will find much exact information in the State Papers of the next\r\nreign dealing with the surveys taken of most of the new and old ships in\r\n1626 and 1627.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners ordered that the _Elizabeth_ and _Triumph_ should be\r\nsold; £600 is entered in the accounts as received for their hulls in\r\n1618, although as late as 1615, £537 had been spent in repairing them.\r\nThe _Mercury_ had been sold in Ireland in 1611, the _Foresight_ condemned\r\nin 1604, the _Quittance_ and _Tremontana_ were to be broken up, and\r\nthe hulls of the _Garland_ and _Mary Rose_ were to be used for a wharf\r\nin conjunction with a proposed new dock at Chatham. The _Bonaventure_,\r\n_Charles_, and _Advantage_ had long ceased to exist, and the _St Andrew_\r\nand _St Matthew_ had been given to Sir John Leigh in 1604 as being then\r\nno longer servicable. The _Victory_ is said to have been rebuilt into\r\nthe _Prince Royal_, but the connection is not altogether clear. In one\r\npaper[914] of 1610, there is a distinct, and apparently conclusive\r\nstatement, occurring twice over, ‘The _Victory_ now named the _Prince\r\nRoyal_.’ On the other hand Cotton, in his report of 1608,[915] writes, in\r\ndiscussing the waste and embezzlement of material,\r\n\r\n    ‘Thus did the _Victory_ for the transportation, dockinge, and\r\n    breaking uppe stand the King in fower or five hundred poundes\r\n    and yet noe one parte of her serviceable to any use about the\r\n    buildinge of a new as was pretended for a coulour. To conclude,\r\n    though we set her at the rate of 200ˡⁱ yet it had been better\r\n    absolutely for the King to have given her away to the poor than\r\n    to have bin put to the charge of bringing her from Chattam to\r\n    Wollich noe other use having bin made of her than to furnish\r\n    Phinees Pette (that was the only author of her preservation)\r\n    with fewell for the dyette of those carpenters which he\r\n    victualled.’\r\n\r\nThis also appears conclusive. A possible explanation lies in the fact\r\nthat, the _Victory_ having ceased to exist, the _Prince Royal_ may\r\nhave been laid down in that name, and afterwards changed to the later\r\nappellation.\r\n\r\nThe four galleys were a source of constant expense, one or the other\r\nbeing in continual need of repair, rebuilding, or shed protection from\r\nthe weather. They were never used, and in 1629, having ‘been long laid\r\naside as useless vessels’ were ordered to be sold. The new _Antelope_\r\nand _Rainbow_ of 1618 were not claimed by the Commissioners as among\r\nthe vessels of which they should have the credit although they were\r\nboth completed after their entry into office. The _Happy Entrance_ and\r\n_Constant Reformation_ were launched in the presence of the King at\r\nDeptford, and were named by him with intent to commemorate Buckingham’s\r\naccession to his post and the good effects to be expected from it. In\r\n1624 no new vessels were built and the last Navy list of James I is as\r\nfollows:—[916]\r\n\r\n  +--------------+-----------------+------------------+---------------+\r\n  | First rank   | Second rank     | Third rank       |  Fourth rank  |\r\n  +--------------+-----------------+------------------+---------------+\r\n  | _Prince_     | _Repulse_       | _Dreadnought_    | _Phœnix_      |\r\n  | _Bear_       | _Warspite_      | _Antelope_       | _Seven Stars_ |\r\n  | _Merhonour_  | _Victory_       | _Speedwell_      | _Charles_     |\r\n  | _Anne Royal_ | _Assurance_     | _Adventure_      | _Desire_      |\r\n  |              | _Nonsuch_       | _Convertine_     |               |\r\n  |              | _Defiance_      | _Happy Entrance_ |               |\r\n  |              | _Lion_          | _Bonaventure_    |               |\r\n  |              | _Vanguard_      | _Garland_        |               |\r\n  |              | _Rainbow_       | _Mary Rose_      |               |\r\n  |              | _Constant       |                  |               |\r\n  |              |   Reformation_  |                  |               |\r\n  |              | _Swiftsure_     |                  |               |\r\n  |              | _St George_     |                  |               |\r\n  |              | _St Andrew_     |                  |               |\r\n  |              | _Triumph_       |                  |               |\r\n  +--------------+-----------------+------------------+---------------+\r\n\r\nThere were also the four galleys and some hoys; eleven of the vessels\r\nwere noted as needing more or less substantial repairs and most of the\r\nold ones were broken-backed. The ten new ships cost £6 a ton for the\r\nlarger and £5, 6s 8d for the smaller ones, against £16 a ton under\r\nMansell’s improvident management, but these prices were for the hulls\r\nand spars alone.[917] According to the _Pipe Office Accounts_ the cost\r\nof the _Happy Entrance_ and _Constant Reformation_ was £8850; of the\r\n_Victory_ and _Garland_ £7640, which included masts and spars, carving\r\nand painting; of the _Swiftsure_ and _Bonaventure_ £9969, and here an\r\nadditional £1169 was paid for sails, anchors, and fittings; of the _St\r\nGeorge_ and _St Andrew_ £9632, and £1306 more for fittings down to boats\r\nand flags; and £8106 for the _Triumph_ and _Mary Rose_. Taking them from\r\nDeptford to Chatham varied between £73 and £418, doubtless depending on\r\nthe number of men employed and the time occupied. Burrell’s contracts for\r\n1619 were at £7, 10s and £8 a ton, and the £5, 6s 8d and £6 quoted above\r\nwere only due to the fact that the ten ships measured 1899 tons more than\r\nwas expected which reduced the average.[918] He apparently had to bear\r\nthe loss; no alteration was made in the way of calculating tonnage during\r\nthe reign.\r\n\r\nThere is little to be said about any improvements in rigging or canvas\r\nduring this period. Fore and aft sails are still absent; studding sails\r\nand booms are spoken of in the _Nomenclator Navalis_,[919] but are not\r\nalluded to in any naval document. It may be of interest to quote from the\r\nsame manuscript the rules governing the proportions of masts and yards.\r\n\r\n  Mainmast             three times four-fifths of the beam.\r\n  Foremast             four-fifths of mainmast.\r\n  Bowsprit                  do.          do.\r\n  Mizenmast            one-half of mainmast.\r\n  Topmasts             half the length of lower masts.\r\n  Main yard            five-sixths of length of keel.\r\n  Fore yard            four-fifths of mainyard.\r\n  Top yard             three-sevenths of mainyard.\r\n  Cross-jack yard      four-fifths of mainyard.\r\n  Spritsail yard           do.           do.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shipwrights.]\r\n\r\nBaker, Pett, and Burrell were the three chief shipwrights of the\r\nreign; Ed. Stevens, John Adye, Wm. Bright, Clay, Hen. Goddard, and\r\nMaryott were less known men. Baker died on 31st August 1613 at the age\r\nof eighty-three. As a boy and man he had seen the rise of the modern\r\nNavy, and had himself largely helped by his skill to produce the type\r\nof ship that was found sufficient for that age. That during the whole\r\nof his long life he appears, so far as existing records show, to have\r\nquarrelled with, or spoken ill of, equals, inferiors, and superiors may\r\nbe charitably attributed rather to the unfortunate conditions governing\r\na shipwright’s position than to any natural bent of character. The\r\nwritings or utterances of other shipwrights, that have come down to us,\r\nshow them to have been in no way superior to Baker in these respects. The\r\nships built by him represented sound and honest work. He died in harness\r\nwhile in charge of the repairs of the _Merhonour_ which had been built\r\nunder his superintendence twenty-four years previously, and he was long\r\nremembered as ‘the famous artist of his time.’\r\n\r\nPett had been favoured by Nottingham and Mansell but does not appear to\r\nhave experienced the same partiality from the Commissioners. They chiefly\r\nemployed Burrell, who had previously been master shipwright to the East\r\nIndia Company, but during the next reign Pett came again into favour, and\r\nwas made a principal Officer and Commissioner for the Navy shortly after\r\nBurrell’s death in 1630. The master shipwrights received two shillings\r\na day and lodging money, but all these men had extra allowances, partly\r\ndating from the last reign. Baker had a pension of £40 a year, besides\r\nhis Exchequer fee and payments from the Navy Treasurer. Bright had one\r\nshilling and eightpence a day which had been originally given to Richard\r\nChapman for building the _Ark Royal_, and had been continued in whole or\r\npart to him. Pett’s Exchequer fee had been retained in the family since\r\nit was first granted in the second year of Mary’s reign.[920] Probably\r\nthe orthodox scale of wages would not alone have retained these men in\r\nthe royal service and the pensions were used to make their posts more\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dockyards.]\r\n\r\nDeptford was still the principal yard, but Chatham was rapidly coming\r\ninto greater importance; Portsmouth is hardly mentioned. In 1610 the dry\r\ndock at Deptford was enlarged and a paling made round the yard,[921]\r\nand in the same year there is a charge of £34, 19s for tools to make\r\ncordage at Woolwich. By 1612 cordage was being made there at £28 a ton,\r\nand in 1614 the ropehouse was extended at a cost of £368, and 305 tons\r\nof cordage made there in the year.[922] It was, however, still far from\r\nsupplying the needs of the Navy since in 1617 cordage to £10,400 was\r\nbought. A Dutchman, Harman Branson, superintended the rope factory, at a\r\nsalary of £50 a year. In 1619 the wooden fence at Deptford was replaced\r\nby a brick wall; the only reference to Portsmouth is for the cost, in\r\n1623, of ‘filling up the great dock there, and ramming the mouth of the\r\nsaid dock with rock stones for the better preserving of the yard against\r\nthe violence of the sea.’[923] This was the end of the earliest dry dock\r\nin England. A dock had been frequently urged for Chatham, but it was not\r\nuntil the Commissioners came into power that the matter was seriously\r\ntaken up. They at once devoted their attention to the Medway, for which\r\none reason may have been the great cost attendant on the removal,\r\nbackwards and forwards, of ships between Chatham and Deptford. It has\r\nbeen mentioned that the hulls of the _Garland_ and _Mary Rose_ were used\r\nto support a dock wharf at Chatham; they were joined there by an old\r\nantagonist, the _Nuestra Señora del Rosario_. A sum of £61, 1s 3d was\r\npaid to\r\n\r\n    ‘Thomas Wood, shipwright, and sundry other ... employed in\r\n    digging out the old Spanish ship at Chatham, near the galley\r\n    dock, clearing her of all the stubb ballast and other trash\r\n    within board, making her swim, and removing near unto the\r\n    mast dock where she was laid, and sunk for the defence and\r\n    preservation of the wharf.’[924]\r\n\r\nThe old Spaniard, however, was not even yet at rest. In 1622 occurs the\r\nconcise entry, ‘The hull of the ship called Don Pedroe broken up and\r\ntaken away.’ The men of the seventeenth century were not emotional and\r\nsaw no reason in a useless trophy. They did, in 1624, have a new wharf\r\n‘made at Sir Francis Drake’s ship,’ but there were fees attached to the\r\npreservation of that.\r\n\r\nIn 1619 and 1620, two mast docks were made at Chatham, each 120 feet\r\nlong, 60 feet broad, and five ‘flowers’ deep, and six acres of ground\r\nwere enclosed with them.[925] A further great extension followed in the\r\nshape of a lease from Sir Robert Jackson of 70 or 80 acres of land,\r\ncalled ‘Lordslands,’ on a term of 100 years at £14 a year. Part of this\r\nwas used for a new dock, part for a ropehouse now put up, and part for\r\nbrick and lime kilns, etc.[926] The dock cost £2342, and a path, 137 rods\r\nlong, was made to it from Chatham church.[927] From a new road having\r\nbeen necessary it would seem to have been quite apart from any previously\r\nexisting buildings. In 1623 another dock was building under the direction\r\nof the shipwrights, and the lease of a house on Chatham Hill, for the use\r\nof the Officers, bought from the Dean and Chapter of Rochester.[928] In\r\n1614 the principal Officers were lodged at Winchester House as there is a\r\ncharge of £138, 8s 6d for its repair for their use, and a rent of £70 a\r\nyear was paid; stores were also kept there.\r\n\r\nThe chain, placed by Hawkyns across the Medway at Upnor, is not again\r\nreferred to until 1606, when it was partly repaired and partly renewed.\r\nBut some time before 1623 it must have become worn out, as in that year\r\nit was replaced by a boom made of sixteen masts and forty-three cwt. of\r\niron with cordage proportionate, at a cost of £238, 10s 5d; the hulls\r\nof two ships and two pinnaces were also devoted to the strengthening of\r\nthe barricade. At the same time the water-way through St Mary’s creek\r\nwas again blocked at a cost of upwards of £400.[929] This boom must have\r\nbeen very light, and its history was short and unfortunate, for in 1624\r\nit was broken by ice and carried out to sea. It must have been quickly\r\nreplaced since, from an incidental reference it existed in 1625, and in\r\n1635 two small vessels, the _Seven Stars_ and the _Moon_, were moored\r\nat each shore end for its protection. In the latter year it was said\r\nto be causing deposits of gravel and closing the fairway, and opinions\r\noscillated between a new boom and an iron chain.\r\n\r\nThe dockyards shared the disorganisation of the other departments;\r\nnotwithstanding the exposures of 1608 ten years later the storehouses\r\nat Deptford were said to be ‘full of rotten wood and bad cordage,’ the\r\nscales were light by one pound in the cwt., and while bad materials\r\nwere knowingly received, the good were sold to boatswains and other\r\nships’ officers at low prices. In 1624 Chatham yard remained uninclosed\r\nso that strangers came and took away timber, nails, or any portable\r\narticle. In 1604 the stores at Deptford included 210 masts, 322 loads of\r\ntimber, 41,000 feet of plank, 171 cables, 499 hawsers, 15 serviceable\r\nand 28 unserviceable anchors, 24 compasses, 40 bolts of canvas, 24,000\r\ntree-nails, and many other articles down to ‘a decayed pitch pot,’ and\r\nit is likely that they were larger in number and better in quality at\r\nthis date than at any time during the succeeding fifteen or sixteen\r\nyears.[930] The value of Deptford yard was estimated at £5000, and it was\r\nat one time proposed to remove the whole plant to Chatham.[931]\r\n\r\nSo far as the staff were concerned the ‘ordinary’ of a dockyard\r\nincluded shipkeepers and inferior officers attached to ships lying\r\nup, Upnor Castle (for Chatham), clerical work, rents, watchmen,\r\nclerks, storekeepers, and the superior officers; the ‘extraordinary,’\r\nshipwrights, carpenters, joiners, pumpmakers, sawyers, sailmakers, and\r\nbricklayers. In 1622 wages, per day, were: shipwrights 1s 2d to 2s;\r\ncaulkers 7d to 2s; carpenters 1s 3d to 1s 10d; pumpmakers 1s 6d to\r\n2s; joiners 1s 4d to 1s 8d; sailmakers 1s 8d; sawyers 1s 2d to 1s 4d;\r\nbricklayers 10d to 1s 6d; and labourers 8d or 9d.[932] All these men,\r\nexcept the labourers, had lodging money, varying from 5s 4d in the case\r\nof the master shipwrights to so small a sum as twopence, and probably as\r\nan allowance by the week.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ordnance and Ship Armament.]\r\n\r\nThe armament of ships was still very heavy for their tonnage and\r\naccounted in some measure for their rolling proclivities and the\r\nimpossibility of obtaining a comparatively steady gun platform. Sometimes\r\nit was necessary to dismount some of the guns,\r\n\r\n    ‘The _Dreadnought_ carries 36, yet four of them for seven\r\n    years have been buried in her ballast, as some are also in the\r\n    _Answer_ and other ships.’[933]\r\n\r\nThis stowage of the guns strained the vessel dangerously and caused\r\nleaks, and, as gravel ballast was still employed, an injury was a very\r\nserious matter from the difficulty in reaching the damaged part. The\r\nfollowing gives the number of guns carried by some of the ships, and\r\ntheir weights:—[934]\r\n\r\n  +----------------------+-------+------+---------+---------+------+\r\n  |                      | Cannon| Demi |         |   Demi  |      |\r\n  |                      |Periers|Cannon|Culverins|Culverins|Sakers|\r\n  +----------------------+-------+------+---------+---------+------+\r\n  |                      |       |      |         |         |      |\r\n  |_Prince Royal_        |   2   |  6   |   12    |    18   |  13  |\r\n  |_White Bear_          |   2   |  6   |   12    |    18   |   9  |\r\n  |_Merhonour_           |   2   |  6   |   12    |    12   |   8  |\r\n  |_Anne Royal_          |   2   |  5   |   12    |    13   |   8  |\r\n  |_Victory_             |   2   |  2   |   16    |    12   |   4  |\r\n  |_Swiftsure_           |   2   |  2   |   16    |    12   |   4  |\r\n  |_Constant Reformation_|   2   |  2   |   16    |    12   |   4  |\r\n  |_St George_           |   2   |  2   |   16    |    12   |   4  |\r\n  |_St Andrew_           |   2   |  2   |   16    |    12   |   4  |\r\n  |_Triumph_             |   2   |  2   |   16    |    12   |   4  |\r\n  |_Defiance_            |   2   |  2   |   14    |    12   |   4  |\r\n  |_Repulse_             |   2   |  2   |   14    |    12   |   4  |\r\n  +----------------------+-------+------+---------+---------+------+\r\n\r\n  +----------------------+-------+----------+-------+--------------------+\r\n  |                      |       |          |       |                    |\r\n  |                      |Fawcons|Portpieces|Fowlers|       Weight       |\r\n  +----------------------+-------+----------+-------+--------------------+\r\n  |                      |       |          |       |Tons cwts. qrs. lbs.|\r\n  |_Prince Royal_        |       |     4    |       | 83    8    0    21 |\r\n  |_White Bear_          |       |     4    |       | 77    9    3    23 |\r\n  |_Merhonour_           |       |     4    |       | 66   16    1     0 |\r\n  |_Anne Royal_          |       |     4    |       | 64   15    2     4 |\r\n  |_Victory_             |   2   |          |   4   | 42    0    0    25 |\r\n  |_Swiftsure_           |   2   |          |   4   | 46    8    0    19 |\r\n  |_Constant Reformation_|   2   |     4    |       | 53    2    0    23 |\r\n  |_St George_           |   2   |     2    |   2   | 47   15    2    24 |\r\n  |_St Andrew_           |   2   |          |   4   | 52    2    3    20 |\r\n  |_Triumph_             |   2   |          |   4   | 50   10    1    21 |\r\n  |_Defiance_            |   2   |     4    |       | 55   17    0    25 |\r\n  |_Repulse_             |   2   |          |   4   | 52    7    0     1 |\r\n  +----------------------+-------+----------+-------+--------------------+\r\n\r\nComparison of the rebuilt ships with the armament they carried under\r\nElizabeth is vitiated by the fact that we do not know whether they were\r\nagain of the same size. If, as is possible, they were bigger there seems\r\nto have been a tendency to reduce the weight of ordnance—there is also an\r\ninclination towards greater uniformity.\r\n\r\nThe price of ordnance was from £12 to £15 a ton, and the manufacture was\r\nstill retained in a few hands, its exportation without licence being\r\nstrictly forbidden. In 1619 orders were issued that casting was to be\r\nconfined to Sussex and Kent, that guns were to be landed at or shipped\r\nfrom the Tower wharf only, and that East Smithfield was to be the one\r\nmarket place for their sale or purchase. These were practically the\r\nElizabethan regulations, now perhaps fallen into neglect, renewed. Guns\r\ncould be proved only in Ratcliff fields, and all pieces were to have on\r\nthem at least two letters of the founder’s name, with the year and the\r\nweight of the gun. The founders had still to give bond for £1000 as a\r\nsurety against illegal exportation, and once a year to send in a report\r\nof the number and description of the guns cast and to whom they had been\r\nsold.[935] These precautions were not unneeded, but did not prevent the\r\nsecret sale to foreign buyers any more than similar restrictions had\r\navailed during the reign of Elizabeth. The royal forts themselves were\r\nturned into marts for these and other unlawful transactions. Upnor Castle\r\nis described as ‘a staple of stolen goods, a den of thieves, a vent\r\nfor the transport of ordnance.’ The person holding the post of ‘King’s\r\nGun-founder,’ and therefore licensed purveyor of government ordnance, was\r\naccused of transgressing largely.[936] The method was to require payment\r\nbeforehand, the purchaser taking the risk of seizure; the guns were then\r\nshipped under cover of a warrant authorising them to be sent to London,\r\nbut once at sea they went to the Continent instead of the river.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Salutes and Flags.]\r\n\r\nA few stone shot were still carried and the price of iron shot varied\r\nbetween £10 and £13 a ton,[937] and its expenditure in saluting was\r\nliberal. It was only about this time that gunners were directed to\r\nfire blank charges in these marks of respect, an order that was long\r\ndisregarded. Attempts were made to check the too lavish use of munition\r\nfor salutes, the amount of which depended mainly on the goodwill of the\r\nofficers and the stores of the ship. Gunners were ordered not to shoot\r\nwithout the captain’s permission, and they were forbidden to fire at\r\n‘drinkings and feastings.’ They were further directed to ‘salute no\r\npassengers with more than one piece, or three at the most, except the\r\nperson be of quality and the occasion very great, and that for volleys\r\nof honour no bullets be spent,’ and the captain was not to fail to lock\r\nup the powder room if he went ashore. These regulations were not very\r\neffective. In 1628 the fleet lying at Plymouth ‘shot away £100 of powder\r\nin one day in drinking healths.’[938] Another writer says that salutes\r\nshould be ‘always of an odd number but of no particular number.’ An even\r\nnumber signified the death of the captain, master, or master gunner at\r\nsea during the voyage. Of a kindred nature to the love of display by\r\nnoise was that of display by flags. The _Prince Royal_ was supplied with\r\neight flags, five ancients, and fifty-seven pennants; these however were\r\nof some use in the primitive attempts at signalling, which, however,\r\ndo not appear to have advanced in complexity beyond the point reached\r\na century before. Night signalling had progressed to a greater extent.\r\nTwo lights from the flagship, answered by one from the others, was the\r\norder to shorten sail; three lights astern, placed vertically, to make\r\nsail; a ‘waving’ light on the poop, to lie to; and a ship in distress was\r\nexpected to hang out ‘many’ lights in the shrouds.[939] An order of 13th\r\nApril 1606 authorised all ships to wear a flag containing the St George’s\r\nand St Andrew’s crosses in the main top; at the fore top the flags of\r\ntheir respective countries were worn.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Men-of-war Crews and Discipline.]\r\n\r\nOne great alteration was made in this reign in the manning of men-of-war.\r\nIt had always been customary to place soldiers, in the proportion of\r\none-third of the total complement, on board vessels equipped for service.\r\nThis practice no longer obtained; in 1619 the Commissioners wrote:—\r\n\r\n    ‘Indeed till the year ‘88 soldiers and mariners were then\r\n    usually divided but that and later experience hath taught us\r\n    instead of freshwater soldiers (as they call them) to employ\r\n    only seamen.’[940]\r\n\r\nThis marks the completion of the change from the days when the sailors\r\nwere not called upon to be more than spectators of the actual fighting.\r\nThe crew as a whole was not reduced, ships being heavily armed and the\r\nspars of a man-of-war being equal to those of a merchantman of much\r\ngreater tonnage.\r\n\r\nWe have now the ‘station list’ of the _Speedwell_ of thirty guns which\r\ngives the following division of duties in action: eighteen gunners and\r\nforty-eight men for the battery, fifty small arms men, fifty to work\r\nthe ship and man the tops, four in the powder room, four carpenters\r\nbelow, three trumpeters, three surgeons and mate, four stewards, three\r\ncooks, and three boys. Complaint, however, was more than once made that\r\nnearly one-third of a crew were officers or non-combatants. It will be\r\nnoticed from this list that the vessel was only prepared to man one\r\nbroadside at the time—in this resembling much later practice—and that\r\nthe arrangements implied plenty of sea room and a stand-off fight. At\r\nthis time English seamen shrank from boarding; memories of the enormous\r\nSpanish galleons with their overpoweringly strong crews, and the tactics\r\nthat had defeated them, were too fresh in the mind of the English sailor\r\nto permit him to have that confidence in his ship and himself that he\r\nsubsequently obtained. It has already been noticed that when this ship,\r\nthe _Speedwell_, was lost there was an utter absence of subordination\r\namong the crew, but this lack of discipline appears to have been more or\r\nless present at all times. In 1625, when we were at war with Spain, the\r\n_Happy Entrance_, _Garland_, and _Nonsuch_ were left lying in the Downs,\r\nwith no officers and only a few men on board, because it was Christmas\r\ntime and everyone was on shore merrymaking.[941] At an earlier date Coke\r\nsaid that ships rode in the Downs or put into port while the captains\r\nwent to London, or hardly ever came on board, and the men ran away.[942]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Results of the Reign.]\r\n\r\nFortunately the services of the Royal Navy were never needed in earnest\r\nduring the reign of James. How it would have broken down under the\r\ndirection of Mansell may be inferred from the steady decrease in the\r\nnumber of seaworthy ships, and the increasing disorganisation of\r\nevery department, during each year of his retention of office. The\r\nadministration of the Commissioners was both competent and honest, but\r\nthe grievous results of Mansell’s treasurership were too plainly shown\r\nduring the earlier years of the next reign, when fleets were once more\r\nsent to sea. Ships might be replaced and open peculation checked, but\r\nthe deeper wounds of spirit and discipline caused by fourteen years of\r\nlicense among the higher officials, and fourteen years of heartless\r\nchicanery suffered by those more lowly placed were not so readily healed,\r\nand bore their fruits for long afterwards in the habitual dishonesty of\r\nofficials and workmen, in the disloyalty and half-heartedness of the\r\nseamen, and later, in the shameless knaveries that disgraced the Navy\r\noffice at the close of the century, many of which had their origin under\r\nMansell’s rule. The Commissioners were hampered in their efforts by want\r\nof money, an embarrassment from which Mansell suffered little.\r\n\r\nNor can the King be absolved from the responsibility of permitting\r\nMansell’s misdeeds. He knew at least as early as 1608 of the iniquities\r\ndaily occurring in every branch of the service, but he contented himself\r\nwith making ‘an oration.’ He was ready enough to act as an amateur\r\narbiter on technical details, to superintend launches, to visit the\r\nships, and to give them euphuistic names, but that portion of his kingly\r\noffice which involved protecting the helpless and punishing the guilty\r\nwas sufficiently satisfied by ‘an oration.’ And had not Buckingham\r\ndesired to be Lord Admiral, we have no reason to suppose that James I\r\nwould have seen any cause for interference merely on behalf of seamen who\r\nwere starved and robbed, or of the English people whose chief defence was\r\nbeing destroyed, and whose money went to enrich a ring of thieves. So far\r\nhad the traditions of Plantagenet and Tudor kingliness degenerated into\r\nStewart ‘kingcraft.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES I\r\n\r\n1625-1649\r\n\r\nPART I—THE SEAMEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe life of Charles, Lord Howard of Effingham and Earl of Nottingham,\r\ncommander of the English fleet in 1588, and for thirty-three years Lord\r\nAdmiral of England, may be regarded as the link between the mediæval\r\nand the modern navy. Born in 1536, and dying in 1624, his era connects\r\nthe cogs and crayers, carracks and balingers of the Plantagenets, then\r\nhardly out of use, with the established Royal Navy of James I, a fleet\r\ndivided into rates; controlled on present principles, and differing but\r\nlittle in essentials from that existing up to the introduction of armour\r\nand machine guns. His period of authority included the struggle which\r\nshaped isolated maritime essays into an organised navy, and fashioned a\r\nschool of seamanship of which the traditions have never since been lost.\r\nAlthough we cannot point to any important measure known to be directly\r\ndue to his initiative, his influence, during at any rate the earlier\r\nhalf of his time of office, must, judging by results, have been always\r\nexercised towards the selection of capable men for command, towards the\r\nadoption of any promising invention or improvement, and towards the\r\nencouragement and welfare of the seamen on whom the stress of work and\r\ndanger must fall, and for whom he always showed a humane sympathy. At\r\nthe time of trial he proved himself equal to his responsibilities; and\r\nthat he was so well served by his subordinates of all grades implies a\r\nconfidence and respect on their part not given merely to a peer and an\r\nofficer of the crown, but to one in whose skill, care, and kindliness,\r\nexperience had already taught men of all ranks to confide. Then, as now,\r\nonly an able leader had good officers and willing men. He clung too\r\nlong to office, and his old age was sullied by an eagerness for money\r\namounting almost to avarice, and by the unwavering support given to one\r\nas unworthy of it as Mansell; no allegation, however, was ever made\r\nagainst his own honesty, either of act or purpose, and for the rest his\r\nyears are his best excuse. He has a right to be judged by his season of\r\nvigorous manhood, when acting with the other sea heroes of the age of\r\nElizabeth, among whom he holds an honourable place.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The new Political Conditions.]\r\n\r\nThe reign of James I may be looked upon as a maritime truce, during which\r\nold antagonisms remained latent while new ones were springing into life.\r\nThe contest with Spain was practically terminated, that power having been\r\nvanquished not so much by English superiority of seamanship as by the\r\nnational decay due to causes patent to all students of history. But now\r\nother and more dangerous rivals were to be faced in France and the United\r\nProvinces, both wealthier than England, the former temporarily strong\r\nin a centralised monarchy of which the resources were to be wielded by\r\nRichelieu, and in an army reorganised and a navy created by him, the\r\nlatter spiritually strong from the same sources as had stirred English\r\nthought, with traditions of mercantile supremacy reaching back to the\r\ndawn of European commerce, and proud of a successful contest with the\r\ngreatest of European states. Moreover the fresh strife was to be waged\r\nunder less favourable conditions than heretofore. Against Spain England\r\noccupied a position of strategical advantage; her fleets concentrated\r\nat any western port could strike at either the mother country or at the\r\nstraggling, disconnected colonies of the new world. Against France and\r\nthe Low Countries she was between hammer and anvil, her own harbours\r\ncontinually threatened, her commerce exposed to constant attack, and her\r\nfleets quite insufficient in strength for their new duties. Nor had the\r\ninterval of peace been utilised in view of the approaching conflict,\r\nalthough it cannot be said that warnings were wanting. The royal ships\r\nwere fewer in number and of little greater strength than at the death\r\nof Elizabeth; few improvements had been effected in their construction,\r\nwhile seamanship had greatly deteriorated, owing to the decay of the\r\nfishing industry, the lack of enterprise and long voyages, and the bad\r\ntreatment of the men. England was still greatly dependent on Russia for\r\ncordage and other naval necessaries, an administrative weakness of which\r\nSpain had endeavoured to take advantage in 1597 by negotiating with the\r\nrulers of Russia and Poland for a cessation of such exports to England\r\nand Holland,[943] but a weakness which might have formidable results\r\nwith enemies planted on the line of communication. The Dutch had taken\r\nthe lesson to heart, for, since that year, they had made their own\r\ncordage.[944]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: England, France, and Holland.]\r\n\r\nAn examination of the comparative wealth and state revenues of the\r\nthree countries would show the relative position of England to be still\r\nless favourable. Although the commerce of this country had increased\r\nduring the reign of James, the royal revenue, except that drawn from the\r\ncustoms, had remained nearly stationary, while the administration was\r\nmore extravagant than that of Elizabeth, and the salaries of officials\r\nand the prices of materials and labour were higher, owing to the influx\r\nof the precious metals. The wars of France and the Netherlands had\r\nindirectly given room for expansion to English commercial and speculative\r\nactivity; but, in the one case, the reign of Henry IV, and, in the other,\r\nthe truce with Spain had enabled both countries to meet their rival\r\non more equal terms. The same causes operated throughout the reign of\r\nCharles, for it may be held that the place of England as a naval power in\r\n1642 was even relatively lower than in 1625; and this without reference\r\nto the question of good or bad government, for any attempt to maintain a\r\nmaritime supremacy comparative to the last years of the sixteenth century\r\nwould have entailed national bankruptcy. That strength was a temporary\r\nand, in a sense, artificial condition, attributable not to the actual\r\npower or resources of the country, but to the momentary cessation of the\r\ncompression of mercantile rivalry and competition, to the stimulus due\r\nto the increase of circulating coin, and in a lesser degree, to the wave\r\nof moral exaltation then moving the Teutonic races.[945] Indeed, it may\r\nbe said in favour of the ship-money writs that but for the fleets they\r\nenabled Charles to send to sea, and so present a semblance of power, the\r\nstrife with France and Holland might have been precipitated by nearly\r\nhalf a century. That they had some such intimidating influence was shown\r\nby the care taken by the French fleets, also cruising, to avoid meeting\r\nthem, and the efforts of the French court to evade the question of the\r\ndominion of the narrow seas.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for England that the troubles of the Fronde coincided\r\nwith the first Dutch war, for had the strength of France been then\r\nthrown into the balance against fleets and dockyards still organised on\r\na Tudor scale, which had undergone little expansion during two reigns,\r\nthe maritime glory of this country might have had an early end. Even\r\nif Charles had not quarrelled with his parliaments, no grants of theirs\r\ncould have kept pace with the rapid growth of French prosperity; in\r\n1609, after paying off an enormous amount of crown debts, the yearly\r\nrevenue was 20,000,000 livres,[946] and in 1645 it was £3,560,000.[947]\r\nThe ordinary revenue of the English crown in 1610 was £461,000, in 1623\r\n£539,000, in 1635 £618,000,[948] and for the five years from 1637 to 1641\r\nit averaged £895,000 a year, exclusive of ship money.[949] It has been\r\ndifficult to obtain any statistics for the United Provinces, but, as the\r\ntrade and commercial marine on which they relied were greater than those\r\nof England, it is obvious that a contest with France alone would have\r\noverwhelmingly strained our resources during the reign of Charles I, and\r\nthat an alliance of the two states would, in all probability, have been\r\nmost disastrous to us. M. Lefèvre Pontalis indeed, in the first chapter\r\nof his ‘Vie de Jean de Witt,’ states exactly that the Dutch merchant\r\nmarine comprised 10,000 sail and 168,000 men; but, as he gives no\r\nauthority and may be referring to any one of the first seventy-five years\r\nof the seventeenth century, the information in that form is valueless for\r\npurposes of comparison.[950]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Cadiz Fleet of 1625]\r\n\r\nThe accession of Charles led to a more active prosecution of the war with\r\nSpain, signalised by the Cadiz expedition of 1625, and the administrative\r\nincidents of this voyage enable us to measure the decadence of seamanship\r\nand the utter collapse of the official executive during the twenty years\r\nof peace. Efforts had been made to get the fleet away during the summer,\r\nbut owing to want of money, stores, and men, it did not sail till 8th\r\nOctober, too late in the season to do effective service. Disease raged\r\namong the soldiers and sailors assembled at Plymouth, and not a boat\r\nwent ashore but some of its men deserted. Of 2000 recruits sent first to\r\nHolland and then to Plymouth only 1500 arrived at the sea-port, of whom\r\n500 were ill;[951] and the few professional sea captains there, who saw\r\nthe unpromising material in men and supplies being collected, continually\r\nwarned the Council and Buckingham of the results to be expected from\r\nthe quality of the men and provisions and the want of clothing.[952]\r\nWhen the expedition finally sailed, its equipment appears to have been\r\nrather that of a defeated and disheartened fleet returning home after\r\nlong service than of a long planned and prepared enterprise. The ships\r\nwere leaky and their gear defective; the _St George_ was fitted with\r\nsails which were used by the _Triumph_ in 1588, while her shrouds were\r\n‘the old _Garland’s_ and all starke rattan.’ The _Lion_ was in such bad\r\ncondition that she had to be left behind. The cordage supplied was rotten\r\nbut ‘fairly tard ovar.’ An officer writes: ‘There was great wrong done\r\n... by pretending the ships were fit to go to sea.’[953] Even before they\r\nleft port the casks were so faulty that beer came up in the ships’ pumps,\r\nso that by November they were reduced to beverage of cider ‘that stinks\r\nworse than carrion, and have no other drink.’ A few days after leaving\r\nPlymouth it was already thought necessary to put five men on four men’s\r\nallowance, and by December they were on half rations which ‘stinks so as\r\nno dog of Paris Garden would eat it.’ Men ill fed and ill clothed, sent\r\nacross the Bay in early winter, easily broke down, and when they arrived\r\noff Cadiz, after a twenty-one days’ voyage, and before even seeing the\r\nenemy, one-fourth of the men on six of the men-of-war were on the sick\r\nlist.[954] The _Convertine_ had only fifteen men in a watch. In November\r\n‘the sickness is so great that there are not seamen enough to keep the\r\nwatches,’[955] and a month later there were not ten men fit for duty on\r\nboard the _St George_.[956]\r\n\r\nSir Edward Cecil, Viscount Wimbledon, the commander-in-chief, was a\r\nsoldier of only average capacity accustomed to the methodical Dutch\r\nmilitary discipline, and he was aghast at the ways of his officers, who,\r\nbesides being ignorant of their work, shared with their men what plunder\r\nthere was. Many of the captains were landsmen who depended on their\r\nsubordinates to handle their vessels, and these men, unaccustomed to\r\nlarge ships and to sailing in comparatively close order, were constantly\r\nin difficulties. If the subordinates were good seamen, they were mostly\r\ncontemptuous of their commanders. Sir Thos. Love, captain of the _Anne\r\nRoyal_, issued orders to the whole fleet without Cecil’s knowledge;\r\nthe master of the _Reformation_ flatly refused to obey his captain’s\r\ncommands. It does not seem to have occurred to Cecil or his advisers that\r\nany sailing orders were necessary during the voyage out, and the result\r\nof independent management was that collisions were frequently occurring;\r\nbeakheads, galleries, and bowsprits were carried away, and ‘the confusion\r\nwas such that some had their starboard when other had their larboard\r\ntacks on board.’[957] Sometimes the ships chased each other, under the\r\nimpression that they were enemies, although the differences between the\r\nEnglish and Spanish schools of shipbuilding were almost as great as\r\nthose to be observed in a cruiser of the middle of this century and a\r\nmerchantman of the same time. Two transports with 300 soldiers on board,\r\nperhaps thinking that they had better prospects of success by themselves\r\nthan with Cecil, deserted and turned pirates.[958]\r\n\r\nThe flagship was the _Anne Royal_, Nottingham’s _Ark Royal_ of 1588, of\r\nwhich he lovingly said that she was ‘the odd ship of the world for all\r\nconditions.’ She was handy enough for the Elizabethan seamen who built\r\nher and knew how to work a ship at sea, but she did not win favour in\r\nthe eyes of Cecil and his officers, who complained that they could not\r\nmake her lie to and that she rolled too much for their dainty stomachs.\r\nNottingham’s opinion of them might have been even more scathing than\r\ntheirs of the _Anne Royal_. More justly Cecil expressed his astonishment\r\nat the amount of theft which prevailed. He could not prevent his captains\r\npillaging the cargoes of prizes, ‘a thing of such custom at sea that\r\nI cannot see how it will be remedied.’ The men he considers the worst\r\never seen; ‘they are so out of order and command and so stupefied that\r\npunish them or beat them they will scarce stir.’[959] Sick and starving\r\nit was not their fault if they were dull and inefficient, but neither\r\nCecil nor those next him in rank were the men to rouse English sailors\r\nto those efforts which, when well led, they can be moved to make under\r\ncircumstances of surpassing distress.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this Cadiz expedition indicates the low water mark of English\r\nseamanship. There have been many previous and subsequent occasions\r\nwhen fleets were sent to sea equally ill found and ill provided, but\r\nnever, before or since, have we such accounts of utter incapacity in\r\nthe mere everyday work of a sailor’s duties. The shameful picture\r\nof that confused mass of ships crowded together helplessly, without\r\norder or plan, colliding with each other, chasing or deserting at\r\ntheir own will, the officers losing spars and sails from ignorance of\r\nthe elementary principles of their art, is the indictment against the\r\ngovernment of James I which had allowed the seamanship of Elizabeth\r\nto die out in this generation. It was the first time that the new\r\nsystem of the commissionership had been tried by conditions of active\r\nservice, and on the side of stores and provisions, for which they were\r\nmainly responsible, the breakdown was as complete as on the side of\r\nnavigation. Assuming their honesty, which was probable, but of which\r\nsome of their contemporaries hint doubts, they were mostly merchants or\r\ncourt officials, unacquainted with naval matters, and evidently unable\r\nto adapt the routine peace control to which they were accustomed to the\r\nwider requirements of war time. As even the normal method of inspection\r\nwas almost nominal, depending mainly on subordinate officials of little\r\ncharacter, capacity, or responsibility, such stores as were now bought,\r\nunder the pressure of immediate necessity, usually proved expensive\r\nand bad. Among the higher officials the impression given by the State\r\nPapers, now and afterwards, is that their chief desire was to get money\r\nsent to them on some pretext—purchase of clothes or arms, payment of\r\nwages, etc.—and that they could then trust to their own ingenuity to\r\naccount for its expenditure, possibly for the benefit of the service,\r\ncertainly for their own. Not even a nominal system of inspection existed\r\nin the victualling department. The two contractors, Apsley and Darrell,\r\nappear, when the Commissioners had once given their orders, to have sent\r\nwhat provisions they pleased on board the ships, quite independently of\r\nany supervision or of any way of calling them to account, for supplies\r\ninfinitely more deadly to our men than the steel and lead of the\r\nenemy.[960]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Disorganisation:—The Return of the Fleet.]\r\n\r\nNaval historians have usually considered the condition of the seaman,\r\na mere pawn in the game, as of little account compared with graphic\r\ndescriptions of sea fights and the tactics of opposing fleets. He had,\r\nhowever, not only existence but memories, and an examination of his\r\ntreatment under the government of Charles I, will systematise scattered\r\nreferences, and may go far to explain why the Royal Navy ‘went solid’ for\r\nthe Parliament in 1642. We have seen that there was little demand for\r\nhis services during the reign of James I, though the few men employed\r\nhad reason to be mutinous and discontented under their scanty fare and\r\nuncertain wages. With Charles on the throne the seagoing population was\r\ncalled away from the fisheries and trading voyages to man the royal\r\nfleets, although the attitude of Parliament caused smaller resources\r\nto be available to support their cost. The sailor, being a despised\r\nand inarticulate quantity, soon felt the result. When the ships of the\r\nCadiz fleet straggled ignominiously home in midwinter, some to Kinsale,\r\nsome to Milford, Falmouth, Plymouth, and other western ports, a cry\r\nfor help went up from the captains and officials concerned. The _Anne\r\nRoyal_ with 130 dead and 160 sick, had scarcely fifteen men in a watch;\r\na vessel at Milford had not sufficient to man her long boat, and the\r\ndried fish remaining was ‘so corrupt and bad that the very savour thereof\r\nis contagious.’[961] Pennington, who was usually more intelligible than\r\ngrammatical, wrote from Plymouth that ‘the greatest part of the seamen\r\nbeing sick or dead, so that few of them have sufficient sound men to\r\nbring their ships about,’[962] and ‘a miserable infection among them,\r\nand they die very fast.’ St Leger told Conway that it would not be\r\npossible to move the men till they had recovered some strength, ‘they\r\nstink as they go, and the poor rags they have are rotten, and ready to\r\nfall off,’ and that many of the officers were in nearly as bad case as\r\ntheir men.[963] But the government had expended all its available means\r\nin the preparation, such as it was, of the expedition, and could neither\r\npay the men off nor provide them with clothes, victuals, or medical aid.\r\nMoreover, the attention of Buckingham was fixed rather on the equipment\r\nof another fleet than on the plight of the men, a condition which he\r\ndoubtless regarded as one they should accept naturally, and a detail\r\nunworthy of _la haute politique_ in which he and his master intrepidly\r\nconsidered themselves such proficients. Pennington had orders to collect\r\nforty sail at Plymouth, but as yet had only four ships.[964] There were\r\nno stores, no surgeons, and no drugs, he reported; and everything on\r\nboard the returned vessels would have to be replaced, even the hammocks\r\nbeing ‘infected and loathsome;’ the mayor of the town would not permit\r\nthe sick men to be put ashore, so that contagion spread among the few\r\nhealthy remaining. He hints that there is little hope of getting fresh\r\nmen to go when they had their probable fate before their eyes. All the\r\nremedy the Council seemed to find was to order the Commissioners to\r\nprepare estimates for fleets of various strengths, while the _Anne Royal_\r\nand four other ships were lying in the Downs with ‘their companies almost\r\ngrown desperate,’ the men dying daily and the survivors mutinous. In\r\nMarch, Pennington, who was an honest, straightforward man and a good\r\nseaman, and who wrote to Buckingham in an independent and even reproving\r\nway, which reflects some credit on both of them in that servile age, says\r\nthat he has twenty-nine ships, but neither victuals, clothes, nor men;\r\nthat those sent down run away as fast as they are pressed. ‘I wish you\r\nwere a spectator a little, to hear their cries and exclamations; here die\r\neight or ten daily,’ and, if something is not done ‘you will break my\r\nheart.’[965] Under James the men considered that the galleys were better\r\nthan the royal service; thus early in the reign of his son they had come\r\nto the conclusion that hanging was preferable.[966]\r\n\r\nBut Buckingham was quite superior to all such particulars. Complaints\r\nhad been made to him that merchantmen were chased into the Downs by\r\nDunkirkers, while the men-of-war lying there did not even weigh anchor.\r\nHe sharply censured Palmer, who was in command, but Palmer’s reply was\r\na variation of the old legal defence; they had not been chased, and if\r\nthey had been he was without victuals or necessaries enabling him to\r\nmove.[967] As the captain of one of his ships wrote to Nicholas that\r\nhe had no sails, and that he could not obtain their delivery without\r\ncash payment, the second portion of his statement was probably true.\r\nThe greatest stress, however, fell upon Pennington at Plymouth. It need\r\nhardly be said that there was not yet a dockyard there; but there was not\r\neven a government storehouse, the lack of which mattered less as there\r\nwere no stores, such provisions as were procured being urgently needed\r\nfor the daily requirements of the crews. In April Pennington heard that\r\nthere was £2000 coming down, but he was already indebted £2500 for which\r\nhe had pledged his own credit, and his estate ran risk of foreclosure\r\nunless the mortgage was cleared.[968] He adds: ‘I pray you to consider\r\nwhat these poor souls have endured for the space of these thirteen or\r\nfourteen months by sickness, badness of victuals, and nakedness.’\r\n\r\nOfficial routine worked, in some respects, smoothly enough. If some of\r\nthe officers and men—like those of the _St Peter_, a prize in the royal\r\nservice—petitioned Buckingham direct, begging for their discharge,\r\nsaying that they could get neither pay nor food, and would have perished\r\nfrom want if they had not been supplied by their friends, they were\r\nreferred to the Commissioners, who suavely remarked: ‘there are many\r\nother ships in the same predicament.’[969] If others applied direct to\r\nthe Commissioners, they were told to go to those who hired them, as the\r\nNavy Board would ‘neither meddle nor make’ with them, ‘which answer of\r\ntheirs I find strange,’ says Pennington.[970] One day the crew of the\r\n_Swiftsure_ mutinied and went ashore, intending to desert in a body. He\r\nwent after them and persuaded them to return, but ‘their cases are so\r\nlamentable that they are not much to be blamed for when men have endured\r\nmisery at sea and cannot be relieved at home in their own country, what\r\na misery of miseries is it!‘[971] Not all the officers of rank were\r\nas kindly as Pennington; Sir John Watts could only see in the clamour\r\nof ragged and starving men ‘insolent misdemeanours.’ At Harwich the\r\nmutineers vowed that they would no longer shiver on board, but would lie\r\nin the best beds in the town, all the elysium the poor fellows aspired\r\nto. It almost seemed as though the naval service was disintegrating\r\nand that such organisation as it had attained, was to be broken up,\r\nsince the shipwrights and labourers at the dockyards were also unpaid,\r\nalthough they did not find it so difficult to obtain credit. Pennington\r\nwas now almost despairing, and said that having kept the men together\r\nby promises as long as he could, only immediate payment would prevent\r\nthem deserting _en masse_, and ‘it would grieve any man’s heart to hear\r\ntheir lamentations, to see their wants and nakedness, and not to be able\r\nto help them.’[972] There is a curious resemblance between these words\r\nand those used nearly forty years before by Nottingham in describing\r\nthe condition of the men who had saved England from the Armada, and\r\nwho were likewise left to starve and die, their work being done. But\r\nany comparison is, within certain limits, in favour of Charles and\r\nBuckingham. Elizabeth had money, but all through her life held that men\r\nwere cheaper than gold. In 1626 the sailors were the first victims of\r\nthe quarrel between King and Parliament, a struggle in which, and in its\r\nlegacy of foreign wars, they bore a heavy share of the burden, and from\r\nwhich even to-day they have reaped less benefit than any other class of\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\nThe original estimate for the Cadiz fleet was under £300,000, but in\r\n1631 it was calculated that altogether, for the land and sea forces,\r\nit had amounted to half a million,[973] and as the government found it\r\nimpossible to procure this or any serviceable sum they resorted to the\r\nexpedient of nominally raising wages all round.[974] The seaman’s monthly\r\npay, ten shillings during the reign of James, had been temporarily raised\r\nto fourteen for the attack on Cadiz; in future it was to be permanently\r\nfifteen shillings, subject to a deduction of sixpence for the Chatham\r\nchest, fourpence for a preacher, and twopence for a surgeon, and as the\r\nscale remained in force till the civil war, and was eventually paid with\r\ncomparative punctuality, the full list for all ranks, per month may be\r\nappended here:[975]\r\n\r\n                           _£_ _s_ _d_      _£_ _s_ _d_\r\n\r\n  Captain[976]              4  14   4   to  14   0   0\r\n  Lieutenant[977]           3   0   0   ”    3  10   0\r\n  Master                    2   6   8   ”    3  13   9\r\n  Pilot                     1  10   0   ”    2   5   0\r\n  Master’s mate             1  10   0   ”    2   5   0\r\n  Boatswain                 1   3   4   ”    2   5   0\r\n  Boatswain’s mate          1   0   8   ”    1   6   3\r\n  Purser                    1   3   4   ”    2   0   0\r\n  Surgeon                   1  10   0\r\n  Surgeon’s mate            1   0   0\r\n  Quartermaster             1   0   0   ”    1  10   0\r\n  Quartermaster’s\r\n  mate                      0  17   6   ”    1   5   0\r\n  Yeomen of {jeers     }    1   1   0   ”    1   5   0\r\n            {sheets    }\r\n            {tacks     }\r\n            {halliards }\r\n  Carpenter                 1   1   0   ”    1  17   6\r\n  Carpenter’s mate          0  18   8   ”    1   5   0\r\n  Corporal[978]             0  18   8   ”    1  10   4\r\n  Gunner                    1   3   4   ”    2   0   0\r\n  Gunner’s mate             0  18   8   ”    1   2   6\r\n  Cook                      1   0   0   ”    1   5   0\r\n  Master Trumpeter          1   5   0   ”    1   8   0\r\n  Other trumpeters          1   3   4\r\n  Drummer                   1   0   0\r\n  Fifer                     1   0   0\r\n  Armourer                  1   1   0\r\n  Gunmaker                  1   1   0\r\n  Seaman                    0  15   0\r\n  Gromet                    0  11   3\r\n  Boy                       0   7   6\r\n\r\nThe purpose in appointing lieutenants was\r\n\r\n    ‘to breed young gentlemen for the sea service.... The reason\r\n    why there are not now so many able sea-captains as there is\r\n    use of is because there hath not been formerly allowance for\r\n    lieutenants, whereby gentlemen of worth and quality might be\r\n    encouraged to go to sea. And if peace had held a little longer\r\n    the old sea captains would have been worn out, as that the\r\n    state must have relied wholly on mechanick men that have been\r\n    bred up from swabbers, and ... to make many of them would cause\r\n    sea service in time to be despised by gentlemen of worth, who\r\n    will refuse to serve at sea under such captains.’[979]\r\n\r\nAccording to this view the original naval lieutenant was equivalent to\r\nthe modern midshipman, in which case his pay seems very high, unless\r\nit is to be explained by the tendency to favour social position. The\r\nmidshipman, introduced somewhat later, was at first only an able\r\nseaman with special duties. The foregoing extract is in itself a\r\nvivid illustration of the reasons for the loathing, yearly growing\r\nin intensity, the seamen, or ‘mechanick men,’ had for their courtier\r\ncaptains.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Disorganisation:—Poverty of the Crown.]\r\n\r\nAs at the time the crown was making these liberal promises it had not\r\nsufficient money to fit out two ships required for special service on\r\nthe Barbary coast, and as vessels were being kept in nominal employment\r\nbecause even a few hundred pounds could not be raised wherewith to pay\r\noff their crews, it is not surprising that the men showed no renewed\r\neagerness to die lingeringly for their country, and that the proclamation\r\nof April needed a corollary in the shape of another threatening deserters\r\nwith the penalty of death. This was issued on 18th June, and a week\r\nlater the crew of the _Lion_ at Portsmouth, 400 or 500 strong, left the\r\nship with the intention of marching up to London. The officers read the\r\nlast proclamation to them and promised to write about their grievances;\r\nbut the men, quite unappalled, replied that ‘their wives and children\r\nwere starving and they perishing on board.’[980] Wives and children were\r\nneglected factors in the dynastic combinations of Charles and Buckingham,\r\nand husbands and fathers might consider themselves amply rewarded if\r\ntheir efforts enabled the King to restore the Palatinate to his nephew.\r\nThe Commissioners complained despondingly that they were unable to\r\nprogress with the new fleet while the back wages were unpaid, and ‘the\r\ncontinual clamour ... doth much distract and discourage us.’[981] The\r\n_Swiftsure_ at Portsmouth had only 150 instead of 250 men, of whom 50\r\nwere raw boys, and all the other ships there were but half manned.\r\nPalmer, commanding in the Downs, had never suffered such extremity even\r\nin war time, he said, and his men flatly refused to work unless they were\r\nfed, a really justifiable form of strike. At this date there were six\r\nmen-of-war and ten armed merchantmen at Portsmouth, but, says Gyffard,\r\nthe men ‘run away as fast as they are sent ... all things so out of order\r\nas that I cannot see almost any possibility for the whole fleet to go to\r\nsea in a long time.’[982] The intensity of Captain Gyffard’s feelings\r\nsomewhat obscured his clearness of expression.\r\n\r\nThe lessons of the previous year appear to have taught nothing; the\r\nvictuallers were still sending in provisions of the old bad quality,\r\nand the beef sent to Portsmouth weighed only 2 lbs. the piece, instead\r\nof the 4 lbs. for which the crown was charged. The Chatham shipwrights\r\nthreatened to cease work unless they were paid, and Pennington, now\r\nat Portsmouth, wrote that after all the preparations, extending over\r\nsome months, there were no hammocks and not even cans or platters to\r\neat and drink from. All these requests and complaints poured in nearly\r\ndaily on Buckingham who should have been an organising genius to deal\r\nwith the complex disorder, instead of merely a man of some talent and\r\nmuch optimism, also troubled by a refractory Parliament, perverse\r\ncontinental powers scornful of his ingenuous diplomacy, and the varied\r\nresponsibilities of all the other departments of the government. In\r\nSeptember the Commissioners pointed out to him that a debt of £4000 a\r\nmonth was being incurred for want of £14,000 to pay off the men, who were\r\nnow reduced to stealing their daily food; those in the river were so\r\ndisorderly that the Board could not meet without danger, as the sailors\r\nthreatened to break the doors down on them, and the shipwrights from\r\nChatham had besieged them for twenty days.[983]\r\n\r\nBy this time, however, as the result of requiring the coast towns to\r\nprovide ships, forced loans, and other measures, Willoughby was at sea\r\nwith a fleet, but one which was a third weaker in strength than had been\r\nintended. Before reaching Falmouth he found twenty tuns of ‘stinking\r\nbeer’ on his own ship, and the rest of the squadron was as ill off. The\r\nmen were ‘poor and mean’ physically, and deficient in number, the stores\r\ngenerally bad and insufficient, there being only enough provisions to\r\ngo to the Straits of Gibraltar and back again, and the excursion being\r\nuseless, because too late in the year, when all the enemies’ fleets had\r\nreturned home.[984] The complaint of want of men was met by an order that\r\nhe should take on board 500 soldiers to help in working the ships; in two\r\nvessels intended for him two-thirds of the men had run away, being too\r\nglad to escape at the cost of forfeiting five months’ wages due to them,\r\nand the Commissioners proposed to fill their places ‘by forcing men to\r\nwork with threatenings, having no money to pay them.’[985] The artless\r\nbelief of their kind in the efficacy of threats once more placed them in\r\na foolish position. The crew of the _Happy Entrance_ refused to sail,\r\nsaying that they would rather be hanged ashore than starve at sea,[986]\r\nbut even the relentless egotism of Charles was not equal to hanging them.\r\n\r\nIt may be said for the Commissioners that their situation was not\r\na happy one, seeing that they were continually ordered to perform\r\nimpossibilities. When they were told to provide fresh ships and men, they\r\nretorted that they were already keeping twelve vessels in pay for want of\r\nmoney to discharge the crews, the wages bill alone running at the rate\r\nof £1782 a month.[987] Other men sent away with tickets, which could not\r\nbe paid when presented, congregated round their house whenever they met\r\nfor business, shouting and threatening and causing them actual personal\r\nfear. There was £20,000 owing to the victuallers, and they, in December,\r\nrefused any further supplies until they had some money, the result\r\nbeing that, at Portsmouth, ‘the common seamen grew insolent for want of\r\nvictuals,’ wrote Sir John Watts, who, in his own person, only suffered\r\nfrom the insolence of a well-lined belly. Sir Allen Apsley, the chief\r\nvictualling contractor, justified himself to the council and pointed out\r\nthe serious consequences to be feared:[988]\r\n\r\n    ‘By the late mutinous carriage of those few sailors of but\r\n    one of H.M. ships the _Reformation_, the humours of the rest\r\n    of the fleet may be conjectured.... What disorder, then, may\r\n    be feared if twenty times that number, having no promise of\r\n    speedy payment, no victuals, fresh or salt, nor ground for\r\n    the officers to persuade or control—for alas! say they, when\r\n    men have no money nor clothes to wear (much less to pawn), nor\r\n    victuals to eat, what would you have them do? Starve? This is\r\n    likely to be the condition of the ships now in the Downs and\r\n    those at Portsmouth, having not two days’ victuals if equally\r\n    divided ... not having any victuals at all but from hand to\r\n    mouth upon the credit of my deputies who are able to trust no\r\n    longer, so as this great disorder may be seen bearing very near\r\n    even to the point of extremity.’\r\n\r\nAbout 2200 men were in this plight, and matters must indeed have been bad\r\nwhen it was no longer to the Victualler’s profit to supply the carrion\r\nbeef and fetid beer useless for any other purpose than to feed seamen.\r\nPunishment and promises were becoming equally useless. An officer at\r\nPortsmouth had to confess that punishing his men only made them more\r\nrebellious, and they revenged themselves by cutting his ship’s cable, in\r\nhopes that she might drift ashore; like Apsley, he remarked that they\r\nwere only victualled from hand to mouth, but adds, ‘with refuse and old\r\nstuff.’[989] Charles was going to recover the Palatinate by means of\r\nhis fleet, but Pennington’s opinion of the armed merchantmen which made\r\nup the bulk of the royal force was not high. He considered that two\r\nmen-of-war could beat the fifteen he had with him, as their ordnance was\r\nmostly useless and they had not ammunition for more than a two hours’\r\nfight.[990] Nor, from incidental references, can the discipline on these\r\nauxiliary ships have been such as to promise success. In 1625 they had\r\nto be forced under fire at Cadiz by threats; in 1628, at Rochelle, they\r\nfired vigorously, but well out of any useful or hazardous range. In this\r\nyear the captain of one of them killed, injured, and maltreated his men,\r\nwhile he and five gentlemen volunteers consumed sixteen men’s allowance\r\nof food every day; and in January 1627, when some of them lying in Stokes\r\nBay were ordered westward, they mutinied and would only sail for the\r\nDowns.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Disorganisation:—The Remedies.]\r\n\r\nIn despair the Council resorted to the expedient of a special\r\ncommission[991] to inquire into the state of the Navy, nineteen in number\r\nand including eight seamen, perhaps in the hope of gaining time, but\r\nprobably from sheer prescription of routine. While the naval organisation\r\nwas crumbling, they took careful measurements of the dimensions of\r\neach ship, and anxiously examined whether Burrell had used his own or\r\ngovernment barges for the conveyance of stores. When they inquired at\r\nwhat cost ships were built, the answer came in a petition from the\r\nChatham shipwrights that they had been twelve months,\r\n\r\n    ‘without one penny pay, neither having any allowance for meat\r\n    or drink, by which many of them having pawned all they can,\r\n    others turned out of doors for non-payment of rent, which with\r\n    the cries of their wives and children for food and necessaries\r\n    doth utterly dishearten them.’[992]\r\n\r\nJohn Wells, storekeeper to the Navy, had 7½ years’ pay owing to him, and\r\nit may be inferred that, unless he was more honest than his fellows,\r\nthe crown, if it did not pay him directly, had to do so indirectly. The\r\nTreasurer of the Navy, like the Victualler, had refused to make any more\r\nadvances on his own credit, but when the Chatham men marched up to London\r\nin a body, he promised to settle their claims, a promise which was not\r\nfulfilled. Then the special commissioners had to deal with the crews of\r\nthe _Lion_, _Vanguard_, and _Reformation_. The men of the _Vanguard_\r\ntold them that they were in want of food, clothing, firing, and lodging,\r\n‘being forced to lie on the cold decks.’[993] The sailors, like the\r\nshipwrights, came to London in the hope of obtaining some relief, but\r\nwith even less success. Their ragged misery was an outrage on the curled\r\nand scented decorum of the court, and Charles perhaps feared that they\r\nmight not confine themselves to mere vociferation, and, heroic as he\r\nlooks on canvas, had no liking for the part of a Richard Plantagenet in\r\nface of a threatening mob. He confined himself to ordering the Lord Mayor\r\nto guard the gates and prevent them coming near the court, and Apsley, in\r\nhis other capacity as lieutenant of the Tower, was directed to ‘repress\r\nthe insolencies of mariners’ by ‘shot or other offensive ways.’[994]\r\nProbably death from Apsley’s ‘shot’ was, even if as certain, a less\r\npainful fate than that from his victuals. As for Charles, we may suppose\r\nthat the lesson in kingly honour, justice, and responsibility was not\r\nthrown away on those of his seamen who lived till 1642.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the financial straits of the government large schemes\r\nrelating to the increase of the number of ships and the construction of\r\nnew docks were being continually planned. In naval as in other affairs\r\nBuckingham’s vision was fixed on the future, careless of the present.\r\nSuch money and supplies as were obtained did not go far towards relieving\r\nthe necessities of the sailors. In May, Mervyn found that his own crew\r\ncame unpleasantly ‘’twixt the wind and his nobility,’ for, ‘by reason\r\nof want of clothing, they are become so loathsome and so nastily sick\r\nas to be not only unfit to labour but to live.’[995] Among the State\r\nPapers, undated but assigned to this year, occurs the first instance of a\r\nround robin yet noticed; the men signing it refuse to weigh anchor until\r\nprovisioned.[996]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Disorganisation:—Its Continuance.]\r\n\r\nDespite all these drawbacks Buckingham had contrived to get together the\r\nRhé fleet of 1627, by various means, although the pecuniary receipts were\r\nnot nearly adequate to the requirements. Some 3800 seamen were employed,\r\nand when they came home were worse off than ever, and the monotonous\r\nsequence of complaints was continued with greater intensity. The crew\r\nof the _Assurance_ deserted in a body; the sailors at Plymouth were\r\nstealing the soldiers’ arms and selling them to obtain bread,[997] and\r\nwages were running on at the rate of £5000 a month, because there was no\r\nmoney wherewith to pay off the men.[998] By December 500 sailors of the\r\nreturned fleet had died at Plymouth, and both there and at Portsmouth the\r\ntownspeople refused to have the sick men billeted ashore, for at Plymouth\r\nthey professed to have never shaken off the infectious fever spread by\r\nthe men of the Cadiz fleet. If we had any statistics at all of the death\r\nand disease on board the fleets of 1625-8, the figures would probably\r\nbe ghastly in the terrible mental and physical suffering they would\r\nrepresent. In this century the ‘wailing-place’ on the quays of Amsterdam,\r\nwhere the friends and relatives of Dutch sailors bid them farewell, was\r\nwell known, but in another sense, and too often for a longer farewell,\r\nevery royal ship was a wailing-place for English wives and mothers.\r\nNicholas, as Buckingham’s secretary, sometimes had franker communications\r\nthan were sent to his master. Mervyn wrote to him that the king would\r\nshortly have more ships than men, there being commonly twenty or thirty\r\nfresh cases of sickness every day, and\r\n\r\n    ‘the more than miserable condition of the men, who have neither\r\n    shoes, stockings, nor rags to cover their nakedness ... all\r\n    the ships are so infectious that I fear if we hold the sea one\r\n    month we shall not bring men enough home to moor the ships.\r\n    You may think I make it worse, but I vow to God that I cannot\r\n    deliver it in words.... The poor men bear all as patiently\r\n    as they can.... I much wonder that so little care be taken\r\n    to preserve men that are so hardly bred. I have used my best\r\n    cunning to make the _Vanguard_ wholesome. I have caused her\r\n    to be washed all over, fore and aft, every second day; to be\r\n    perfumed with tar burnt and frankincense; to be aired ’twixt\r\n    decks with pans of charcoal; to be twice a week washed with\r\n    vinegar.... Yet if to-day we get together 200 men within four\r\n    days afterwards we have not one hundred.’[999]\r\n\r\nWatts, at Portsmouth, who, in the intervals of solicitation of money for\r\nhimself and preferment for his son, wrote abusively of men who asked\r\nat least food and clothing in midwinter, was a man after Charles’s\r\nown heart, for he also had arranged with the governor of the town to\r\nuse ‘shot,’ if necessary, when the seamen came showing their tattered\r\nclothes and making ‘scandalous speeches.’[1000] Mervyn, in the letter to\r\nNicholas quoted above, admits that he has overdrawn his pay, but asks\r\nfor another advance, and doubtless officers who had friends at court,\r\nor who could afford to bribe, had little difficulty in obtaining their\r\nsalaries. Nicholas, for instance, who subsequently developed into a\r\nknight and secretary of state, had an itching palm on occasion. On the\r\nother hand, even in later years, when the pressure was not so great,\r\nif the paymaster or pursers advanced any portion of the wages already\r\ndue to the mere sailor, a discount of 20 per cent. was deducted for the\r\nfavour. The merchant was also competing with the royal service, owners\r\npaying 30s a month; therefore the need for men caused boys and weakly\r\nadults to be pressed, and during the winter the mortality among them was\r\ngreat.[1001] In January 1628 Mervyn reported from Plymouth that there\r\nwere no hammocks, and\r\n\r\n    ‘the men lodge on the bare decks ... their condition miserable\r\n    beyond relation; many are so naked and exposed to the weather\r\n    in doing their duties that their toes and feet miserably\r\n    rot and fall away piecemeal, being mortified with extreme\r\n    cold.’[1002]\r\n\r\nA few days later he said that things were worse than ever, that the\r\nvessels were full of sick men, they being refused ashore.[1003]\r\nNotwithstanding the refusal to have them ashore their diseases spread so\r\nrapidly on land that both Plymouth and Portsmouth were ‘like to perish.’\r\n\r\nA striking feature in this wretched story is the want of sympathy shown\r\nby nearly all the officials, high or low. These extracts are taken\r\nprincipally from the letters of those officers who felt for their men and\r\nendeavoured to obtain some alleviation of their distress, but many of\r\nthe despatches contain only dry formal details or, as in the instances\r\nof Watts and Sir James Bagg—Eliot’s defamer and, from his absorptive\r\ncapacity in relation to government money, known as the Bottomless\r\nBagg—are filled with cowardly gibes and threats directed at men who could\r\nnot obtain even their daily bread from the crown. It has long been held a\r\npoint of honour with officers to share the dangers and hardships of those\r\nunder their command, but in those years the superiors to whom the men\r\nlooked for guidance and support left them to suffer alone, ‘the infection\r\nso strong that few of the captains or officers durst lie on board.’[1004]\r\nThe sailors in the river were somewhat better off. Perhaps their\r\nproximity to the court, and potentialities of active protest, stirred the\r\nmost sensitive portion of Charles’s conscience, and arrangements were\r\nmade to billet them on the riverside parishes, at the rate of 3s 6d a\r\nman per week, till money could be provided to pay them. This was a plan\r\nwhich relieved the crown at the expense of the householder; nor does it\r\nappear to have been very successful, since a proclamation was issued on\r\n17th February to repress the disorderliness of such billeted mariners and\r\nwarning them not to presume to address the Commissioners. In March the\r\npressed men at Plymouth armed themselves, seized the Guildhall, and there\r\nprepared to stand a siege.[1005] The issue is not stated, but although\r\nmutinies were continually happening they usually had little result, for\r\nif the men got away from the ship or town the endeavour to reach their\r\nhomes would have been almost hopeless. They were only frantic outbursts\r\nof desperation by isolated bodies of a class which has always lacked the\r\ngift of facile expression, and has never learnt to combine. An official\r\ndescribes plainly the causes of these mutinies, and his paper is worth\r\nquoting in full:[1006]\r\n\r\n    ‘1st. They say they are used like dogs, forced to keep aboard\r\n    without being suffered to come ashore to refresh themselves.\r\n    2nd. That they have not means to put clothes on their backs to\r\n    defend themselves from cold or to keep them in health, much\r\n    less to relieve their poor wives and children. 3rd. That when\r\n    they happen to fall sick they have not any allowance of fresh\r\n    victuals to comfort them, or medicines to help recover them.\r\n    4th. That some of their sick fellows being put ashore in houses\r\n    erected for them are suffered to perish for want of being\r\n    looked unto, their toes and feet rotting from their bodies, and\r\n    so smelling that none are able to come into the room where they\r\n    are. 5th. That some provisions put aboard them is neither fit\r\n    nor wholesome for men to live on. 6th. That therefore they had\r\n    as lief be hanged as dealt with as they are.’\r\n\r\nGorges suggests that some of these complaints are frivolous and some\r\nuntrue, and recommends the remedy, dear to the official soul, of a\r\ncommission. The commission of 1626 had hardly ceased sitting, and how far\r\nthe complaints were frivolous and untrue, can be judged by the evidence\r\nbrought forward here.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Murder of Buckingham.]\r\n\r\nIn April, 1628, Denbigh sailed to relieve Rochelle, and returned without\r\nhaving effected his purpose. Preparations then went on apace for the\r\ngreat fleet Buckingham proposed to command himself in August. The\r\ndifficulty in obtaining provisions, and their quality, may be inferred\r\nfrom a petition of Sir Allen Apsley’s addressed directly to the king. He\r\nsays that he has sold and mortgaged all his property, and that he and\r\nhis friends had pledged their credit to the extent of £100,000.[1007]\r\nThese were unpromising conditions under which to engage to supply a fleet\r\nwhich was intended to be as large as that of 1625, and as the crown could\r\nnot suddenly replace the mechanism organised by the Victualler and his\r\ndeputies, it was practically dependent on his efforts. It was probably\r\ndue to the poverty of Sir Allen Apsley that in this fleet water was,\r\nfor the first time, taken from a home port as what may be called a\r\nprimary store.[1008] Hitherto, although water had been taken for cooking\r\npurposes, beer, as has been shown, had always been the recognised drink\r\non ship board. In June the ships were being collected at Portsmouth,\r\nbut with the usual troubles. There were two mutinies. ‘God be thanked,\r\nthey are quieted,’ writes Coke, but the men ‘have no shift of clothes.\r\nSome have no shirts, and others but one for the whole year.’ There were\r\nfew surgeons, and those few ‘haunt the taverns every day.’[1009] In\r\none party of 150 pressed men sent down in July there were to be found\r\nsaddlers, ploughmen, and other mechanics; some were old and weak and the\r\nmajority useless. Pettifogging tricks were employed to trap the men.\r\nIn one instance Buckingham ordered that certain vessels were not to be\r\npaid off till the _Swiftsure_ and other ships were ready, and that then\r\nPeter White was to be present to at once press the crews for further\r\nservice.[1010] Fire ships were required, but Coke found that they could\r\nnot be had without £350 in cash, as no one would trust the Crown.[1011]\r\n\r\nBuckingham himself did not intend to share the hardships of the beings\r\nof coarser clay under his command. A transport was fitted to serve as\r\na kitchen and store ship for him, and the bill for his supplies came\r\nto £1056, 4s. It included such items as cards and dice, £2; wine,\r\netc., £164; eight bullocks and a cow, £59; eighty sheep, £60; fifteen\r\ngoats, £10; ten young porklings, £5; two sows with pig, £3; 980 head\r\nof poultry, £63, 1s.; 2000 eggs, £2, 10s; and pickled oysters, lemons,\r\ndamask tapestry, and turkey carpets.[1012] Then came Felton’s knife, and\r\nwe may hope that some of the sailors made an unwonted feast on the more\r\nperishable articles of this liberal collection. In any case, Buckingham’s\r\nmurder was an unmixed good for them, although had he spared to the men\r\nsome of that energy and care he gave, at least with good intention, to\r\nthe improvement of the _matériel_ of the navy, the verdict might have\r\nbeen different. But in his neglect of their rights or welfare he was\r\nnot below the standard of his age, in which the feudal feeling remained\r\nwithout its sense of reciprocal obligation, and in which only a very few\r\nwere impelled by conscience to more than the defence of their own rights.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Its Results.]\r\n\r\nOne result of the shuffling of the political pack which followed\r\nBuckingham’s death was the appointment of Weston as Lord Treasurer.\r\nWeston, Mr Gardiner tells us, was neither honest, nor amiable, nor\r\npopular, but he was at any rate determined to re-introduce some order\r\ninto the finances, and the sailors were among the first to reap the\r\nbenefit. When the Rochelle fleet, which had sailed under Lindsey,\r\nreturned, the men were as surprised as they were delighted to find\r\nthat they were to be paid. ‘The seamen are much joyed with the Lord\r\nTreasurer’s care to pay them so suddenly.’[1013] All the same the civic\r\nauthorities of Plymouth desired that the ships should be paid off\r\nsomewhere else. They wrote to the Council that when the Cadiz expedition\r\ncame back, 1600 of the townspeople died of diseases contracted from the\r\nsoldiers and sailors, that many also perished after the return of the Rhé\r\nfleet, and that they heard that this Rochelle one was also very sickly,\r\nand if so, ‘it will utterly disable this place.’[1014] Either there was\r\na relaxation of Weston’s alacrity in paying, or mutinous habits had\r\nbecome too natural to be suddenly discarded, as in November the crews of\r\nthree of the largest of the men-of-war were robbing openly, for want of\r\nvictuals, they said. Nevertheless we do not hear of many difficulties in\r\nconnexion with the Rochelle fleet, and the work of payment may be assumed\r\nto have progressed with unexpected smoothness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: After Buckingham.]\r\n\r\nWith the cessation of ambitious enterprises the demand for the services\r\nof the maritime population became less, although the smaller number of\r\nmen employed were treated no better than when the government had the\r\nexcuse, such as it was, of large expenditure. In 1629, Mervyn, commanding\r\nin the narrow seas, wrote to the Lords of Admiralty: ‘Foul winter\r\nweather, naked bodies, and empty bellies make the men voice the King’s\r\nservice worse than a galley slavery.’[1015] It should be remarked that\r\nalthough hammocks were provided for over-sea service in the proportion of\r\none for every two men, they were not yet furnished to ships stationed in\r\nhome waters, a want which must have affected the health and contentment\r\nof the seamen even when they were properly fed. Again, Mervyn protests:—\r\n\r\n    ‘I have written the state of six ships here in the Downs, two\r\n    of which, the _Dreadnought_ and 3rd whelp, have neither meat\r\n    nor drink. The 10th whelp hath drunk water these three days.\r\n    The shore affords soldiers relief or hope, the sea neither.\r\n    Now with what confidence can punishment be inflicted on men\r\n    who mutiny in these wants?... These neglects be the cause that\r\n    mariners fly to the service of foreign nations to avoid his\r\n    majesty’s.... His majesty will lose the honour of his seas,\r\n    the love and loyalty of his sailors, and his royal navy will\r\n    droop.’[1016]\r\n\r\nThey were prophetic words, and as another illustration of the methods\r\nwhich were to secure the sailors’ love and loyalty we find in October,\r\namong the notes of business to be considered by the Lords of the\r\nAdmiralty, ‘poor men’s petitions presented above six months, and never\r\nread.’ Mutiny had become merely a form of protest, and captains looked\r\nforward to it as only a sign of dissatisfaction. One of them writes\r\nto Nicholas that his crew are in ‘an uproar’ about their offensive\r\nbeer, and that if he finds no fresh supply at Plymouth he is sure of a\r\nmutiny;[1017] another commander was forced to pawn his spare sails and\r\nanchors to buy food for his men.[1018] Apsley died in 1630, leaving\r\nhis affairs deeply involved, the crown still owing him large sums. His\r\ncoadjutor, and then sole successor, Sir Sampson Darell, did not fare\r\nbetter at the hands of the government, although his requirements were\r\nso much less. In June 1632 he informed Nicholas that he would be unable\r\nto continue victualling unless he was paid, having raised all the money\r\nhe could on his own estate.[1019] If he received anything on account it\r\nwas evidently not enough to insure permanent improvement, since a year\r\nlater we hear that the cruisers are ‘tied by the teeth’ in the Downs for\r\nwant of provisions.[1020] During these years the debts incurred from the\r\nearly expeditions of the reign were being slowly discharged, and the\r\nscantiness of the available resources for fresh efforts is shown by the\r\nway Pennington complains that six or seven weeks of preparation were\r\nneeded to collect three months’ victuals for four ships.[1021]\r\n\r\nFrom the absence of references in the State Papers to the non-payment\r\nof wages it would seem as though they were now paid with comparative\r\nregularity, but the expressions of disgust at the quality of the\r\nprovisions are as continuous and vigorous as before. Besides methods of\r\ncheating in the quantities served out, for which the victuallers and\r\npursers were answerable, ‘the brewers’—of course with the connivance of\r\nthe victuallers—‘have gotten the art to sophisticate beer with broom\r\ninstead of hops, and ashes instead of malt, and (to make it look the\r\nmore lively) to pickle it with salt water, so that while it is new it\r\nshall seem to be worthy of praise, but in one month wax worse than\r\nstinking water.’[1022] The same writer says that the English were the\r\nunhealthiest of all ships, in consequence of the practical application\r\nof the proverb that ‘nothing will poison a sailor.’ Then he laments that\r\nEnglish mariners, formerly renowned for patience and endurance, were now\r\nphysically weak, impatient, and mutinous—and blames the sailor for the\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ship-money Fleets.]\r\n\r\nThe first systematic issue of ship-money writs was in October 1634, and\r\nin the summer of 1635, the resulting fleet was at sea. As usual the\r\nprovisions were an unfailing source of indignation, and Lindsey, who was\r\nin command, told the Lords Commissioners that much of the beef was so\r\ntainted that when it was moved ‘the scent all over the ship is enough\r\nto breed contagion.’ The crews were made up with watermen and landsmen\r\nignorant of their work, and many were weak and sickly; three men-of-war\r\nand several of the hired merchantmen were quite disabled by the sickness\r\non board them.[1023] A special matter of complaint was the large number\r\nof volunteers and their servants who went for a harmless summer cruise\r\non Lindsey’s ships. That they were useless and in the way was of less\r\nimportance than that officers were aggrieved by finding their cabins\r\ntaken from them to house these people in comfort, and that the seamen\r\nwere irritated by seeing the idlers given the first choice of food,\r\nhaving to wait for their own till the visitors were served.[1024] If the\r\ngreater part of the beef was fetid, and the officers and volunteers had\r\nright of selection, what could have been left for the men?\r\n\r\nApparently the sailors had as little liking as ever for the royal\r\nservice, since, in 1636, the old difficulties were renewed in obtaining\r\nseamen for the second ship-money fleet under Northumberland. In April\r\nthe men were said to be continually running away; in June out of 250 men\r\nturned over from the _Anne Royal_ to the _St Andrew_ 220 deserted.[1025]\r\nWhen Northumberland returned in the autumn, typhus was rife in his\r\nsquadron, and Mervyn reported that the men ‘in this weather fall sick\r\nfor want of clothing, most of them barefoot and scarcely rags to hide\r\ntheir skins.’[1026] Northumberland, not content with merely commanding in\r\nstate, attacked the shortcomings of the naval administration furiously\r\nwhen he came ashore. Many of his strictures relate to subjects to be\r\nnoticed, subsequently, but concerning the men he said that they were\r\nincapable both bodily and in their knowledge of seamanship; that out of\r\n260 men in the _James_ not more than twenty could steer, that in the\r\n_Unicorn_ there was hardly a seaman besides the officers, that nearly\r\none-third of the _Entrance’s_ crew had never been to sea, and that of\r\n150 men in the last-named ship only twelve could take the helm.[1027]\r\nThe provisions, he said, were bad and meagre, and the men defrauded of a\r\nfourth or fifth of their allowance. Moreover sick men must either be kept\r\non board ‘or turned ashore in danger of starving, not to be received into\r\nany house, so as some have been seen to die upon the strand for lack of\r\nrelief.’\r\n\r\nSuch was the tender care monarchy by divine right, with its paraphernalia\r\nof Commissioners and Lords of the Admiralty, vouchsafed to that class\r\nof its subjects which happened to be voiceless and helpless. But if the\r\ncoming struggle between divine right and capitalist right was to render\r\nthe sailor’s assistance valuable, and temporarily improve his position,\r\nthe experience of succeeding generations was to show that to him it made\r\nlittle difference whether life and health were sacrificed under the\r\nstately forms of monarchical procedure, or by the more obviously sordid\r\nprocesses of mercantile traffic. There was no ‘glorious revolution’ for\r\nmen whose welfare depended on a legislature influenced by merchants\r\nand shipowners, and ignoble with the soulless ethics of the eighteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Victualling.]\r\n\r\nAccording to official documents the victualler, Sir Sampson Darell,\r\nmust have died not long after Apsley, as his accounts for five years\r\nare passed by his executrix.[1028] The absence of professional control\r\ndid not probably cause any extra mismanagement; at any rate no murmurs\r\nare heard on that score. It is impossible to say now whether Apsley\r\nwas a victim, or only received his deserts, in having claims for\r\n£69,436 in 1626 and £94,985 in 1627 rejected because his books were\r\nsigned by only three instead of four Commissioners and on account of\r\ninsufficient particulars. As they were not finally refused until 1637\r\nhis representatives were allowed plenty of time to prove their case. In\r\nFebruary 1637 John Crane, ‘chief clerk of our kitchen,’ was made Surveyor\r\nof marine victuals, his appointment dating from 20th Nov. 1635. The\r\nallowance of drink and solid food was the same as in the last century,\r\nand sugar, rice, and oatmeal were medical luxuries theoretically provided\r\nfor sick men in the 1636 fleet, on the equipment of which Northumberland\r\nexpressed such trenchant criticisms. Crane undertook the victualling at\r\nthe rate of eightpence halfpenny a man per day at sea, and sevenpence\r\nhalfpenny in harbour, but in March 1638 he gave the necessary year’s\r\nnotice to terminate his contract.[1029] He found that during 1636 and\r\n1637 he had lost a penny three farthings a month on each man, and owing\r\nto the general rise in prices, anticipated a further loss of as much as\r\n3s 4¾d a head, per month, in 1638. He entreated an immediate release from\r\nhis bargain, or he would be ruined, and he had thirteen children. In all\r\nthese memorials one invariably finds that the petitioner possesses an\r\nenormous family.\r\n\r\nIn 1637 the Earl of Northumberland was again at sea in what Sir Thomas\r\nRoe expected would be ‘one turn to the west in an honourable procession,’\r\nand the Earl himself wrote, ‘No man was ever more desirous of a charge\r\nthan I am to be quit of mine.’[1030] He was, however, the first competent\r\nadmiral among the nobility that Charles had been able to find. From\r\nthe absence of any accounts of mutiny and disorder we may take it\r\nthat either the men were better treated this year or that the superior\r\nofficers were tired of complaining. In 1638 Northumberland was ill, and\r\nall the work the ship-money fleet did was to convoy two powder-laden\r\nvessels through the ships blockading Dunkirk.[1031]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Discipline.]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that men like Pennington and Mervyn had not the heart to\r\npunish for insubordination under the circumstances of privation which\r\nmade their crews seditious and disobedient, and the normal discipline\r\non a man-of-war was, in all likelihood, sufficiently lax. Some of the\r\nregulations, however, if they were carried out, were strict enough,\r\nalthough they will compare favourably with the bloodthirsty articles\r\nof war of the succeeding century, and they show some difference from\r\nprevious customs. Prayer was said twice daily, before dinner and after\r\nthe psalm sung at setting the evening watch, and any one absent was\r\nliable to twenty-four hours in irons. Swearing was punished by three\r\nknocks on the forehead with a boatswain’s whistle, and smoking anywhere\r\nbut on the upper deck, ‘and that sparingly,’ by the bilboes. The thief\r\nwas tied up to the capstan, ‘and every man in the ship shall give him\r\nfive lashes with a three-stringed whip on his bare back.’ This is, I\r\nthink, the first mention of any form of cat. The habitual thief was,\r\nafter flogging, dragged ashore astern of a boat and ignominiously\r\ndismissed with the loss of his wages. For brawling and fighting the\r\noffender was ducked three times from the yardarm, and similarly towed\r\nashore and discharged; while for striking an officer he was to be tried\r\nfor his life by twelve men, but whether shipmates or civilians is not\r\nsaid.[1032] If a man slept on watch three buckets of water were to be\r\npoured upon his head and into his sleeves, and any one except ‘gentlemen\r\nor officers’ playing cards or dice incurred four hours of manacles. It is\r\nsuggestive to read that ‘no man persume to strike in the ship but such\r\nofficers as are authorised.’[1033]\r\n\r\nThere was no specially prepared fleet in 1639, but in October Pennington\r\nwas in command of a few ships in the Downs, watching the opposed Dutch\r\nand Spanish fleets also lying there. Both he and Northumberland had\r\npressed the King, but in vain, for instructions as to his course of\r\naction in certain contingencies. At last directions were given him that\r\nin the event of fighting between them he was to assist the side which\r\nappeared to be gaining the day, a manner of procedure which Charles\r\ndoubtless thought was dexterous diplomacy, but which most students of\r\nthe international history of his time will consider as ignominious as\r\nit was futile. The Dutch attacked the Spaniards as they were taking in\r\n500 barrels of gunpowder, supplied with the connivance of the English\r\ngovernment[1034]—again Charles’s trading instincts were too strong—drove\r\na score of their vessels ashore, and scattered the remainder.\r\nUnfortunately Pennington, instead of also attacking the Spaniards, fired\r\ninto the Dutch, who did not reply.[1035]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Seamen and the Civil War.]\r\n\r\nDuring 1640 and 1641 Charles was fully occupied with his Scotch and\r\nparliamentary difficulties, and naval business was again falling into\r\ndisorder. In July 1641 Northumberland tells Pennington that he does\r\nnot see how the insubordination the latter reports is to be remedied,\r\nas there is no money with which to pay wages.[1036] In October Sir\r\nWilliam Russell, one of the Treasurers of the Navy, had been a long\r\ntime out of town, and the other, Sir Henry Vane (the younger), ‘seeing\r\nthere is no money in the office, never comes near us.’ Perhaps it was\r\nnot altogether displeasing to the parliamentary leaders that, in view\r\nof the arbitrament towards which King and Parliament were tending, the\r\nseamen should be rendered discontented and rebellious. In January 1642,\r\n2000 sailors offered their services and protection to Parliament, and\r\nwhen, in July, the King appointed Pennington, and Parliament Warwick, to\r\nthe command of the fleet, the men in the Downs, apparently without any\r\nhesitation, followed Warwick, although the former must have had with them\r\nthe influence of a trusted and favourite officer. In several instances\r\nthe crews of ships on outlying stations forced their captains to submit,\r\nor put their royalist officers ashore and themselves took charge. It is\r\ndifficult to speak with absolute certainty, but an examination of the\r\ndata available leads to the conclusion that only one small vessel, the\r\n_Providence_, adhered to the royal cause.\r\n\r\nWe need not conclude that this unanimity implied any deep feeling about\r\nthe general misgovernment of Charles or the important constitutional\r\nquestions at issue. The sailor, contrary to the impression apparently\r\nprevailing among feminine novelists, is usually an extremely\r\nmatter-of-fact individual, with the greater portion of his attention\r\nfixed on the subjects of his pay and food. All he could associate with\r\nthe crown were memories of starvation and beggary, of putrid victuals\r\nfraught with disease, and wages delayed, in payment of which, when he\r\nat last received them, he found a large proportion stick to the hands\r\nof minor officials. The Parliament paid him liberally and punctually,\r\nand he, on his side, served it honestly and well. For him was not\r\nnecessary—perhaps he was not capable of feeling—the curious psychical\r\nexaltation of the ‘New Model,’ but in a steady, unimaginative way,\r\nwithout much enthusiasm but without a sign of hesitation, he kept his\r\nfaith and did more to destroy royalist hopes than historians, with\r\nfew exceptions, have supposed. Under the administration of the Navy\r\nCommittee there were no recurrences of the confusion and unruliness which\r\nhad before existed, and until the Rainsborow mutiny of 1648, speedily\r\nrepented, the seamen showed no symptom, for six years, of discontent or\r\nof regret for the part they had chosen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parliament and the Seamen.]\r\n\r\nWithout feeling an indignation which would have been in advance of\r\ntheir age at the hardships and dishonesty of which the sailor had been\r\nthe victim, the position of the parliamentary chiefs compelled them to\r\ntreat him with a discreet consideration. He was fed decently; wages\r\nwere raised to nineteen shillings a month, and were given in full\r\nfrom the date of his joining his ship, instead of from that of its\r\nsailing; and an attempt was made to raise a sufficient number of men\r\nwithout impressment, the officers responsible being only directed ‘to\r\nuse their best persuasion.’[1037] Seamen, however, had been too long\r\naccustomed to compulsion to enter into the principles of voluntaryism,\r\nand an act allowing pressing and punishing contumacy with three\r\nmonths’ imprisonment, must have been received by them as something\r\nthey could understand.[1038] The utter absence of difficulties or\r\nremonstrances during the years of the civil war shows how smoothly the\r\nnaval administration worked, and Parliament appeared to place even more\r\nreliance on the sailors than on their officers, since on 18th Oct. 1644,\r\nWarwick issued a proclamation ordering that ‘none shall obey the commands\r\nof their superior officers ... if the same commands be tending towards\r\ndisloyalty towards the Parliament.’ This was a dangerous power to place\r\nin the hands of the men, unless it was felt that their discipline and\r\nfidelity could be depended upon.\r\n\r\nThe late Mrs Everett Green speaks of ‘the inherent loyalty of the sailors\r\nto their King,’[1039] making this remark in connection with, and as\r\nexplanatory of, the difficulty experienced by the Council of State in\r\nobtaining men in 1653. I must confess that, notwithstanding the weight\r\njustly attaching to her opinions, I am quite unable to see during these\r\nyears any sign of this loyalty. Under the government of Charles they had\r\nbeen compelled to serve by force, and had lost no opportunity of venting\r\ntheir anger and discontent; when the occasion came they eagerly and\r\nunanimously fought against the sovereign to whom they were supposed to be\r\ninherently loyal, without one instance of desertion or dissatisfaction\r\nof sufficient mark to be noticed in the State Papers. When a mutiny\r\ndid at last occur it was due to circumstances connected not with the\r\nrights of the King, but with the narrower personal jealousies of naval\r\ncommand; it happened when the fighting was done, and, in all probability,\r\nwould not have happened at all under the stress of conflict. During the\r\nCommonwealth they continued to serve the state under conditions of great\r\nstrain and trial, which might well have tried men of greater foresight\r\nand self-control than seamen, without, with perhaps one exception, more\r\nthan slight and unimportant outbursts of insubordination of a character\r\nwhich, allowing for the looser discipline of that time, occur to-day\r\nin all large standing forces. Whatever, at any time, their momentary\r\nirritation against the Parliament, it never took the form of loyalty\r\nto Charles II. It may be suggested that a more likely explanation of\r\nthe difficulties of 1653 lies in the fact that the estimates required\r\n16,000 men against the 3000 or 4000 sufficient for the fleets of Charles\r\nI.[1040] At the most liberal computation the returns of 1628,[1041] do\r\nnot give, allowing for omissions, more than 18,000 men available for the\r\nroyal and merchant marine; at least double that number would have been\r\nnecessary to supply easily the demands of the two services in 1653. In no\r\ncase under the Commonwealth did the men show that despairing recklessness\r\nof consequences which characterised their outbreaks between 1625 and\r\n1642. More significant still is the fact that the savage fighting of\r\nthe first Dutch war, against the most formidable maritime antagonist\r\nwe have ever faced, was performed in a fashion very different from the\r\nperfunctory and half-hearted service rendered to Charles I. And it is a\r\nfurther curious illustration of their hereditary loyalty that while they\r\nendured much hardship and privation rather than serve either under Rupert\r\nor Tromp against the Commonwealth, we are told by Pepys that they manned\r\nthe Dutch ships by hundreds—perhaps thousands—during the wars of Charles\r\nII.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, we are to really believe that ‘inherent loyalty’\r\nwas continuously latent in the English sailor, what words are fitting\r\nfor the selfish and reckless indifference to the simplest human rights\r\nwhich tortured him into twenty years of consistent rebellion? On sea as\r\non land Charles’s misdeeds followed him home. In his days of power he\r\nhad been deaf to the appeals of men who perished that he might attempt\r\nto be great, and to the cries of their suffering wives and children.\r\nIn 1642 the sailors were deaf to his commands. What might—in all human\r\nprobability would—have been the result after Edgehill if, during the\r\nwinter of 1642-3, he had been able to blockade the Thames?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Merchant Seamen.]\r\n\r\nPrivate shipowners have always paid higher wages than the crown, and for\r\nseveral centuries the latter offered no compensatory advantages. From\r\nvarious chance allusions the rates of merchant seamen’s wages during\r\nthis period are found to vary between 22s and 30s a month. The stores\r\nprovided for them could not have been worse than those of a man-of-war;\r\nbut they had special difficulties, peculiar to the merchant service,\r\nto expect when in private employment. In 1628 among their grievances\r\nthey complained that they were liable to make good any damage done to\r\ncargo, even after it had left the ship, until it was safely stored in\r\nthe merchant’s warehouse.[1042] In 1634 they petitioned, in view of the\r\ndulness of trade, that exportation of merchandise in foreign bottoms\r\nshould be prohibited,[1043] but a year later a more important matter\r\noccupied their attention. All engagements were made by verbal contract,\r\nand it often happened at the end of the voyage that the owner disputed\r\nthe terms, when the sailor was left helpless, having no proof to bring\r\nforward.[1044] Moreover, if, as frequently occurred, he was pressed\r\nout of a homeward bound vessel, his position was still more hopeless,\r\nwhile if he died at sea there was small chance of his family obtaining\r\nanything. In 1638 it was intended to form a Trinity House fund, on\r\nthe plan of the Chatham Chest, for the benefit of merchant seamen and\r\nofficers; one shilling a month was to be deducted for this purpose, from\r\nthe wages of officers, and fourpence from the pay of the men, except\r\nthose belonging to coasters, who were to give sixpence.[1045] The matter\r\nprogressed so far that there was a proclamation issued in accordance with\r\nthese views,[1046] but the scheme did not come into operation till 1694.\r\nIn that year it was enforced in connection with Greenwich Hospital at the\r\nrate of sixpence a man; in 1747 this was raised to one shilling and so\r\ncontinued until 1834. The whole story belongs to a later volume, but the\r\nmerchant sailor never received the least benefit from the levy extorted\r\nfrom his scanty earnings, and at a moderate computation was robbed of\r\nat least £2,500,000 during that period. But he helped to endow many fat\r\nsinecures and to thus support the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIf from one case referred to a court of law we may infer others, the\r\nform and amount of punishment on a trader was left to the discretion of\r\nthe captain. On a Virginia ship an insubordinate boy was hung up by his\r\nwrists with 2 cwt. tied to his feet, with what results we are not told.\r\nThe boy’s complaint came before Sir H. Martin, judge of the Admiralty\r\ncourt, who refused any redress, because of the necessary ‘maintenance of\r\nsea discipline.’[1047] But notwithstanding hard fare, hard usage, and\r\nsometimes doubtful wages, the position of the sailor on a merchantman was\r\ninfinitely preferable to his fate when compelled to exchange it for a\r\nman-of-war. We meet with no instances of mutiny on merchant ships until\r\nthey are hired by the crown, and the traditional hardihood and courage of\r\nthe English seaman were always evinced when he was free of the crushing\r\nburden of the royal service. Sir Kenelm Digby, when commanding a squadron\r\nin the Mediterranean in 1628, noticed that while foreigners invariably\r\nran from him, the English, without knowing his nationality, always\r\nstopped and prepared to fight ‘were they never so little or contemptible\r\nvessels.’[1048]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The number available.]\r\n\r\nWith proper organisation there were sufficient men available at the\r\nbeginning of the reign to have manned both the royal and merchant\r\nmarine, as will be seen from the following returns made in 1628, but it\r\nis probable that the numbers did not increase much during subsequent\r\nyears:—[1049]\r\n\r\n  +-------------------+--------+-----------+\r\n  |                   | Seamen | Fishermen |\r\n  +-------------------+--------+-----------+\r\n  |London             |  3422  |    302    |\r\n  |Kent               |   181  |    231    |\r\n  |Cinque Ports       |   699  |    193    |\r\n  |Essex              |   309  |    357    |\r\n  |Suffolk            |   804  |    326    |\r\n  |Norfolk            |   600  |    436    |\r\n  |Lincoln            |    66  |    126    |\r\n  |Devon              |   453  |     86    |\r\n  |Northumberland     |    33  |    260    |\r\n  |Cumberland         |    72  |           |\r\n  |South Cornwall     |   731  |    393    |\r\n  |North    ”         |   154  |     88    |\r\n  |South Wales        |   753  |           |\r\n  |Southampton and }  |        |           |\r\n  |  Isle of Wight }  |   321  |    209    |\r\n  |Dorset             |   958  |     86    |\r\n  |Bristol            |   823  |           |\r\n  +-------------------+--------+-----------+\r\n\r\nThere were 2426 watermen in London, also liable to impressment. Of the\r\nseamen two-thirds were at sea, one-third at home, their favourite abiding\r\nplace being Ratcliff. Yorkshire, North Wales, Chester, and some parts of\r\nSussex are omitted, and the figures for Northumberland cannot include the\r\nNewcastle coal traffic, which in 1626 employed 300 colliers;[1050] it may\r\nbe, however, that their crews are reckoned in the London total.\r\n\r\nIn various ways, during the war time, Parliament showed its satisfaction\r\nwith the work done by officers and men, and occasionally rewarded them\r\nby extra gratuities of a month’s pay, or presents of wine. Doubtless\r\nthese donations were also in the nature of bribes on the part of a power\r\nwithout much historic prestige compared with its opponent, and depending\r\nfor existence on the goodwill of men who served with a closer regard to\r\npay than to sentiment; but that the parliamentary authorities considered\r\ntheir relations with the Navy fairly secure is shown by the fact that\r\nin 1645 they ventured to place the service under martial law.[1051] In\r\n1647 wages, per month, were raised for officers, according to rates, as\r\nfollows—[1052]\r\n\r\n                 £  _s_ _d_    £  _s_ _d_\r\n  Captain        7   0   0 to 21   0   0\r\n  Lieutenant     3  10   0  ”  4   4   0\r\n  Master         3  18   8  ”  7   0   0\r\n  Master’s mate  2   2   0  ”  3   5   4\r\n  Pilot          2   2   0  ”  3   5   4\r\n  Carpenter      1  15   0  ”  3   3   0\r\n  Boatswain      1  17   4  ”  3  10   0\r\n  Gunner         1  15   0  ”  3   3   0\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Chatham Chest.]\r\n\r\nThe Chatham Chest, founded by Hawkyns and others in 1590, for the relief\r\nand support of injured or disabled sailors, was not of so much use to\r\nthem during these years as it should have been. The original contribution\r\nwas sixpence a month from able, and fourpence from ordinary, seamen,\r\nwith threepence from boys. In 1619 the gunners joined the fund, and from\r\n1626 all, whether able and ordinary, seamen or gunners, were to pay\r\nsixpence.[1053] The sixpences were unfailingly deducted from their wages,\r\nbut the distribution was more irregular. Every formality was employed for\r\nthe safe custody of the money, and in 1625 an iron chest with five locks\r\nwas ordered for this purpose, the keys to be kept by five representative\r\nofficers of different grades, who could only open it when together,\r\nand who were to be changed every twelve months. As an illustration of\r\nthe value of these precautions the Treasurer of the Navy, Russell, the\r\nvery next year took £2600, out of the Chest with which to pay wages,\r\nsubsequently excusing himself by the ‘great clamours’ then being made\r\nand the poverty of the state. He did not commence to return this money\r\ntill 1631, and in 1636 £500 of it was still owing. Sir Sackville Crowe,\r\nwhen Treasurer between July 1627 and December 1629, took out £3000, and\r\nthis sum, with the accruing interest, is regularly carried forward as a\r\ngood asset till 1644, when there is a gap of ten years in the accounts,\r\nand in 1654 it no longer appears. From the character of the man it is\r\nvery unlikely that he ever paid. In 1632 a commission of inquiry issued,\r\nbut if any report was ever made it has not come down to us. In January\r\n1636 the Chest had £542 in hand and possessed Chislett farm producing\r\n£160 a year,[1054] but it was said that its narrow resources were further\r\ndepleted by money having ‘been bestowed on men that never were at sea.’\r\n\r\nSir John Wolstenholme and others were directed, in December 1635, to\r\ninquire into the administration, and their report was sent in by April\r\n1637.[1055] The yearly receipts from land were now £205; since 1617, when\r\nthere was £3145 in hand, £2580 had been received in rents and £12,600\r\nfrom the sixpences. Out of this £3766 had been expended in purchasing\r\nland and £10,621 in relieving seamen; £159 remained in the Chest, and\r\n£3780 was owing to it. Of the £3780 some of the items went back to\r\nElizabethan days, and Roger Langford, Sir Peter Buck, some of the master\r\nshipwrights, and two ladies were among the debtors. Between 1621 and\r\n1625, inclusive, there was paid £1722 in gratuities and pensions, and\r\nbetween 1625 and 1629, £1372;[1056] as the first series were mostly\r\npeace, and the second war years, the men were either very successful\r\nin avoiding injury between 1625 and 1629 or, as is more likely, were\r\ndefrauded of the benefits they could rightly claim. The result of the\r\ncommission was that fresh rules, signed by Windebank, were shortly\r\nafterwards made, directing the Treasurer of the Navy to pay over the\r\nsixpences within one month of their deduction from wages, to make up the\r\naccounts yearly and ‘publish them to all the governors,’ that no pension\r\nwas to exceed £6, 8s 4d a year, although an additional gratuity might be\r\ngiven, and that the keepers of the keys were to be changed yearly.[1057]\r\nAs the last regulation was only a repetition of the one made in 1625, it\r\nis to be presumed that it had been previously ignored.\r\n\r\nNeither now nor afterwards, neither in official papers nor in the sheaves\r\nof ephemeral publications which enlightened this and the succeeding\r\ncentury, does it seem, with one exception, to have entered into the minds\r\nof those who ruled or those who tried to teach that the cost of providing\r\nfor the wants or age of men disabled by service should in justice fall\r\nupon the country they had spent their youth and health in protecting,\r\ninstead of on an accident fund maintained from their own meagre earnings.\r\nThe one government which in this, as in other matters, had a higher\r\nperception of its duties was that of Cromwell, and even here only in a\r\nlimited sense. The host of pamphleteers who in the succeeding reigns\r\nlamented the condition of the royal and merchant marine, or aired their\r\nuniversal panaceas for its ills, only rang the changes on further methods\r\nfor the exploitation of the seaman to the private profit of the shipowner\r\nand the general profit of the state. For him to carry the burden of\r\nempire was to be its own reward.\r\n\r\nThe only consecutive accounts preserved for this reign are contained in\r\ntwo volumes kept in the Museum at Greenwich.[1058] They extend from 14th\r\nApril 1637 to 23rd April 1644, and, in round figures, give the following\r\nresults:—\r\n\r\n  +-------------+-------+--------+--------+-----------+----------------+\r\n  |             | Owing |Received|Expended| Received  |    No. of      |\r\n  |             |  to   |        |        |   from    |Pensioners[1059]|\r\n  |             | chest |        |        |   land    |                |\r\n  |             +-------+--------+--------+-----------+----------------+\r\n  |             |    £  |    £   |    £   |   £       |                |\r\n  |1637-8       |  3768 |  1545  |  1361  |  248      |      62        |\r\n  |1638-9       |  6215 |  1609  |  1215  |           |      59        |\r\n  |1639-40      |  5600 |  1849  |  1364  |           |      59        |\r\n  |1640-1       |  5200 |  2371  |  2019  |           |      35        |\r\n  |1641-2       |  4800 |  2761  |  2635  |  479      |      55        |\r\n  |1642-3       |  4400 |  2108  |  1738  |           |      60        |\r\n  |1643-4[1060] |  4400 |  1238  |   958  |           |      61        |\r\n  |1644[1061]   |  4400 |   845  |   483  |  321[1062]|                |\r\n  +-------------+-------+--------+--------+-----------+----------------+\r\n\r\nWe do not know on what principle donations were allowed, but, besides\r\nbeing slow and uncertain, gratuities were frequently dispensed by favour\r\nrather than by merit. In 1637 a man hurt in 1628 received £2, and Apslyn,\r\na shipwright, had £5, 3s 4d, being compensation for the loss of his\r\napprentice’s services during 62 days, a sort of loss certainly never\r\nintended to be indemnified by the founders of the Chest. The majority\r\nof the men on the pension list, had £5 or £6 each, but most of the\r\npayments to injured men were of a donative character not involving any\r\nfurther responsibility. Medical charges relating to the dockyards were\r\nalso met from the Chest, a Chatham surgeon being paid £43, 1s 4d in 1638\r\nfor attending to shipwrights injured while working on the _Sovereign\r\nof the Seas_. The next year has a somewhat belated entry of £3 to Wm.\r\nAdam, barber-surgeon, ‘for sundry hurts and bruises received in Queen\r\nElizabeth’s service,’ and again we find £33, 11s 4d paid to a Woolwich\r\nmedical man for care of shipwrights injured in rebuilding the _Prince_;\r\nin 1640 surgeons were attached to the dockyards whose salaries of £40\r\na year were paid from the Chest money. The compensation for a bruise\r\nranged from £1 to £2. Sometimes widows were granted burial money and a\r\nfurther small sum for ‘present relief,’ but never, apparently, pensions.\r\nA normally recurring item is a gift of £4, 10s a year to the almshouse\r\nfounded by Hawkyns at Chatham, and with equal regularity there is an\r\nannual outlay of some £5 for the governors’ dinners.\r\n\r\nHowever open to criticism may have been the administration of the Chatham\r\nChest at this time, it was undoubtedly in a condition of ideal purity\r\ncompared with the depths of organised infamy to which it sank during the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Rainsborow Mutiny.]\r\n\r\nThe reign of Charles I commenced with mutinies; it ended in 1648 with\r\nanother which deserves examination, since upon it some writers have\r\nbased an inference of general unfaithfulness to the Parliament, while in\r\nreality, whatever conclusions may be deduced, that, so far as the bulk of\r\nthe men were concerned, is not one of them. From the days of Elizabeth,\r\nwhen they were accustomed to be led by captains who were seamen by\r\nvocation and sometimes by descent, often of their own class, and who\r\nunderstood them and their wants, the men had shown an intense dislike to\r\nthe landsmen who by a change of system in later years had been placed\r\nover them, who obtained their posts mainly by rank or influence, were\r\nignorant of maritime matters, and were associated with a succession of\r\ndisasters and years of abject misery. Manwayring, writing in the reign\r\nof James I, says that volunteers usually returned knowing as little as\r\nwhen they sailed, since the professional seamen hated them, and gentlemen\r\ngenerally, and would give no instruction. Another seaman attributed the\r\ndisasters of the early years of the reign to the appointment of landsmen\r\nas captains and officers.[1063] The experiences of more recent years were\r\nnot likely to have lessened that feeling.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, therefore, the fleet had been commanded chiefly by\r\nadmirals and captains who were trained seamen of no exceptional social\r\nposition, but, judging from subsequent events, there must have been a\r\nsufficient leaven of landsmen in places of trust to keep alive the old\r\nprejudices. When, therefore, Wm. Batten, an experienced officer of many\r\nyears’ standing, who was vice-admiral and commanding in the Channel, and\r\nwho had done good service to the state, was displaced in 1647, and his\r\nresponsible charge given to Colonel Rainsborow, who began actual control\r\nin January 1648, there was doubtless some murmuring, although no evidence\r\nof it has survived. Nothing occurred during the winter, and in May 1648\r\nthere were forty-one ships in commission, of which only three were\r\ncommanded by military officers; but the appointment of Rainsborow may\r\nhave been regarded, as it actually proved to be, as the commencement of a\r\nreturn to the old system. Moreover the Navy, generally, was presbyterian\r\nin feeling, while Rainsborow was a fanatical Independent and, judging\r\nfrom one of the accusations brought against him, does not appear to have\r\nexercised his authority with tact or discretion. In addition to this a\r\ncertain amount of ill-feeling existed between the army and the Navy, the\r\nlatter not being inclined to coerce the Parliament to the extent desired\r\nby the army, and Batten, in the ‘Declaration’ which explained his reasons\r\nfor desertion, dwelt on the efforts of the army leaders ‘to flood the\r\nships with soldiers.’ If the accusation was true, it would be a certain\r\nway, in the state of feeling between the two services, to give fresh life\r\nto the latent antagonism existing. We have no details of the workings of\r\ndiscontent which led up to action any more than we have of the secret\r\ncabals which preceded the Spithead mutiny of 1797, but in each case the\r\noutbreak was equally sudden. Towards the end of May the crews in the\r\nDowns put Rainsborow ashore, giving as their reasons:—\r\n\r\n    1st. The parliament of late grant commissions to the sea\r\n    commanders in their own names, leaving out the King. 2nd.\r\n    Several land-men made sea commanders. 3rd. The insufferable\r\n    pride, ignorance, and insolency of Col. Rainsborow, the late\r\n    vice-admiral, alienated the hearts of the seamen.[1064]\r\n\r\nRainsborow had made his mark as a soldier, but he was not a stranger to\r\nthe sea, for he had commanded a man-of-war in 1643. It is noticeable that\r\nno complaints are made about their treatment by the government, about\r\ntheir pay or victuals, and succeeding events showed how little the great\r\nmajority of the fleet were in sympathy with the grandiloquent threats of\r\nthe ringleaders on the King’s behalf. Warwick was at once sent to resume\r\nthe command of the fleet and adjust the differences existing. Whitelocke\r\nsays that the men ‘sent for the Earl of Warwick’ and that ‘the Derby\r\nHouse Committee, to follow the humour of the revolters,’ directed Warwick\r\nto go, so that at this stage it is evident that having rid themselves of\r\nRainsborow, they looked to Warwick rather than to Charles. We do not know\r\nwhat measures the earl took, but, in the last days of June, the crews of\r\nnine ships,[1065] perhaps terrified at finding they received such slight\r\nsupport from the others and fearing punishment, possibly also influenced\r\nby Batten, went over with him to the Prince of Wales in Holland. That so\r\nlong an interval elapsed between the commencement of the revolt and their\r\ndesertion shows how little the latter was at first contemplated.\r\n\r\nIt has been recently said: ‘While the army was so formidable the navy\r\nscarcely existed. The sailors generally were for the King. Many had\r\nrevolted and carried their ships across to Charles II in Holland, while\r\nin the crews that remained disaffection prevailed dangerously.’ It would\r\nbe difficult to mass more inaccuracies in so many words. There were\r\nforty-one fighting-ships actually at sea, a larger number than had been\r\ncollected since the days of Elizabeth, and immeasurably superior as a\r\nfighting machine to anything which had existed since 1588. The ‘many’\r\nwhich had revolted were nine, and of these three were small pinnaces\r\nof an aggregate of 210 tons and 180 men; of the others, one was a\r\nsecond and the rest third and fourth-rates. If ‘disaffection prevailed\r\ndangerously,’ it is strange that not only did none of the remaining ships\r\njoin the revolters, but they were known to be ready to fight them, and\r\nBatten on one occasion avoided an action on account of ‘the very notable\r\nresistance’ to be expected.[1066] Instead of being disaffected, Warwick\r\nfound that on board his own ship they prepared for fighting ‘with the\r\ngreatest alacrity that ever I saw ... which, as the captains informed me,\r\nwas likewise the general temper of the rest of the fleet.’ Finally the\r\nsailors in the Downs, who ‘generally were for the King’ and were actuated\r\nby ‘inherent loyalty,’ concurred in December in the Army Remonstrance,\r\nrequiring that Charles I, ‘the capital and grand author of our troubles,’\r\nshould be brought to justice for the ‘treason, blood, and mischief’ he\r\nhad caused. The after story of the revolted ships is just as instructive\r\non the point of their disaffection to the Parliament. No sooner had\r\nthey reached Holland than the men commenced to desert. By November five\r\nvessels had been brought back to England, and the ill-will manifested on\r\nthe others was so pronounced that it was necessary to place strong bodies\r\nof cavaliers on board to keep the seamen in subjection.[1067]\r\n\r\nThe outburst would have been serious had it been general. It was confined\r\nto a small section of the naval force, was due to dissensions relating to\r\nmen rather than principles, and gives small countenance to the view that\r\nthe Navy repented the part it had taken. The loyalty of the majority and\r\nthe speedy penitence of the minority were the best tests of the temper\r\nin which the Parliament was judged by those who upheld it afloat; and if\r\nthe disaffected minority loved Rainsborow and his employers little they\r\nshowed that they liked Charles Stuart less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES I\r\n\r\n1625-1649\r\n\r\nPART II—ROYAL AND MERCHANT SHIPPING\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Royal Ships in 1625.]\r\n\r\nWhen Charles I inherited the crown, his fleet consisted of 4 first, 14\r\nsecond, 8 third, and 4 fourth rates;[1068] of these 1 first, 7 second,\r\n6 third, and the 4 fourth rates were comparatively new ships, the\r\noldest being the _Prince_, launched in 1610. The others were originally\r\nElizabethan, had been repaired, rebuilt or patched up more or less\r\neffectively at various times, and of them the _Lion_ of 1582 was the most\r\nancient. The recent accessions were, for reasons previously noticed, more\r\ncommodious and better seaboats than their predecessors, but the King had\r\nyet to learn that the mere possession of a naval framework in the shape\r\nof hulls, spars and guns was of little use without efficient crews, and\r\nadequate knowledge and honest effort on the part of the subordinate\r\nofficials on whom fell the responsibility of preparation and equipment.\r\nWhether due to a desire to save the royal ships as much as possible,\r\nto want of men to man them properly, or to their generally inefficient\r\nstate, the expeditions of 1625-7-8 included a very large proportion of\r\narmed merchantmen. In 1625 there were twelve men-of-war and seventy-three\r\nmerchantmen;[1069] in 1627 fourteen of the former, of which three were\r\nsmall pinnaces and eighty-two of the latter[1070]; and in 1628 the second\r\nRochelle fleet, which Lindsey commanded, was made up of twenty-nine\r\nKing’s ships and thirty-one merchantmen.[1071] But under Lindsey, ten of\r\nthe royal ships were of the class known as ‘whelps,’ just built, and\r\nmeasuring 180 tons each, and ten were pinnaces of 50 tons or under, so\r\nthat only nine vessels of the real fighting line were with him. We shall\r\nsee that the owners of merchantmen, who could neither escape the calls\r\nmade on their ships nor get paid for their services, by no means valued\r\nthe honour thus thrust upon them.\r\n\r\nCharles, like his father, felt a keen interest in the Navy. In the case\r\nof James I it was prized more as an imposing appurtenance of his regal\r\ndignity than from any statesmanlike appreciation of its importance;\r\nin that of his son the evidence goes to show that, while vanity was\r\nsometimes a ruling motive,[1072] he was also fully alive to the weight\r\na powerful fleet gave to English diplomacy. The State Papers show that\r\nhe exercised a constant personal supervision in naval affairs, sometimes\r\noverruling the opinions of his officials in technical details of which\r\nhe could have possessed no special knowledge. No new vessels were built\r\nduring the first years of the reign. Theoretically, with the assistance\r\nof the hired merchantmen available, the Royal Navy was sufficient for\r\nthe duties it was called upon to perform. Practically, it was found that\r\neven those that were seaworthy were too slow under sail, as were also the\r\nmerchantmen, to deal with the plague of Dunkirk privateers and Moorish\r\npirates, who swarmed in the narrow seas, and who almost blockaded the\r\ncoasts except for large and heavily-armed ships.\r\n\r\nA chief article of accusation brought by the Parliament against\r\nBuckingham was that he had neglected his duty in taking few or no\r\nmeasures against these enemies, but if all the charges made against him\r\nhad as little foundation, his reputation would be higher than it now\r\nstands. The Channel squadron had been increased, two special expeditions\r\nhad been sent out after them, and any prizes likely to prove fast sailers\r\nhad been taken into the Royal service for the purpose of being so\r\nemployed, but as the Turks and Dunkirkers, built for speed, could sail\r\nat least twice as fast as the English, it was only under exceptional\r\ncircumstances that one was sometimes captured. In 1624 the Captain of one\r\nof the Commissioners’ new and improved ships indignantly reported that\r\nsome Dutch men-of-war he met had deliberately and contemptuously sailed\r\nround him. This was square rig _versus_ square rig. Remembering that the\r\nTurks undoubtedly were lateen-rigged, that the Dunkirkers probably used\r\nsome modification of it, and that this is still the most effective spread\r\nof canvas known for light vessels of moderate tonnage, we need not wonder\r\nthat the lumbering English third and fourth rates, built for close\r\naction, could never get near them. During the Rhé voyage sixty English\r\nships chased some Dunkirkers, but only one pinnace could overtake them,\r\nand that of course could not venture to attack.[1073] But there were also\r\nother causes. In 1634 Pennington wrote to the Admiralty that he had just\r\nmet a fleet of seventeen Dutch ships,\r\n\r\n    ‘all tallowed and clean from the ground, which is a course that\r\n    they duly observe every two months, or three at the most ...\r\n    which is the only cause which makes them go and work better\r\n    than ours; whereas our ships are grounded and graved two or\r\n    three months before they come out, and never tallowed, so\r\n    that they are foul again before we get to sea with them, and\r\n    then they are kept out for eight or ten months, whereby they\r\n    are so overgrown with barnacles and weeds under water that it\r\n    is impossible that they should either go well or work yarely\r\n    ... all men-of-war, of what nation soever, whether Turk or\r\n    Christian, keep this course of cleansing their ships once in\r\n    two or three months but us.’[1074]\r\n\r\nTherefore the first additions to the navy were small, fast-sailing\r\nvessels, built or bought with this object, and the master shipwrights\r\nwere several times called upon to furnish designs of ships especially\r\nadapted for chasing the privateers. Their first suggestion, in December\r\n1625, was for a cruiser whose length, over all, would have been nearly\r\nfour-and-a-half times her breadth, and this is noticeable as a marked\r\nstep in the tendency now existing to increase the proportion between\r\nlength and beam.[1075] Again, in March 1627[1076] they proposed ‘a nimble\r\nand forcible ship of 339 tons to meet the Dunkirkers;’ but in this case\r\nthe length was rather less than four times the beam, and eventually\r\npecuniary necessities compelled the government to be content with vessels\r\nof a smaller model, called ‘whelps,’ contrived for sweeps as well as\r\nsails, and whose length was nearly two-and-a-half times the breadth.\r\nIn merchantmen the keel was still only about two and a half times the\r\nbeam.[1077] Although English ships were slow, they were strong. Nathaniel\r\nButler, a naval captain, attributed their sluggishness as compared with\r\nthe Dutch to their being ‘so full of timber ... we building ours for\r\nseventy years, they theirs for seven;’ and Northumberland, in 1636,\r\ndescribed some of them as ‘so clogged with timber’ that there was no room\r\nfor stores.[1078] Modern builders would probably ascribe their want of\r\nspeed to faulty lines rather than to excess of material; but if it was\r\na defect it was one of which we reaped the full benefit in the first\r\nwar with Holland, when the Dutch ships, splendidly as they were fought,\r\nwere riven and sunk by the more solid and more heavily armed English\r\nmen-of-war long before their crews were beaten.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Navy List.]\r\n\r\nThe following vessels were added to the Navy during the reign of Charles,\r\nincluding such prizes as were taken into the service and remained in it\r\nuntil useless:—[1079]\r\n\r\n

_Swallow_,\r\nand _Henrietta Maria_, were built at Deptford, the first four by Peter\r\nPett, who also built the _Constant Warwick_ at Ratcliff. The _Sovereign_,\r\n_Prince_, _Leopard_, _Greyhound_, _Unicorn_, _Roebuck_, _Adventure_,\r\n_Phœnix_, and _Charles_, at Woolwich; the _Henrietta Maria_, _Vanguard_,\r\n_Lion_, and _Dragon_, at Chatham. Phineas Pett, who built the _Sovereign_\r\nand rebuilt the _Prince_, was a son, by a second marriage, of the Peter\r\nPett, master shipwright in the reign of Elizabeth; his son, Peter Pett,\r\njunior, built the _Nonsuch_, _Adventure_ and _Phœnix_. The Peter Pett of\r\nDeptford was a grandson of the Elizabethan Pett.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ten Whelps.]\r\n\r\nThe first two pinnaces constructed, the _Henrietta_ and the _Maria_,\r\nwere, it is expressly stated,[1093] to be ‘carvel built,’ a distinction\r\nwhich implies that hitherto such small vessels had been clinch or\r\n‘clinker built;’ we have seen that large ones were mostly carvel, or\r\nflush planked, in the reign of Henry VIII.[1094] We do not hear that\r\nthey proved satisfactory in either speed or power, and next year the\r\ncontract for the ten whelps was divided among nine shipwrights, some of\r\nthem private builders, at £3 5s a ton.[1095] They were to be able to use\r\nsweeps, and were square rigged, with three masts, two decks and a round\r\nhouse, as miniature copies of the large ships; like those also they\r\nwere too heavily sparred and ordnanced. Of heavy guns each was intended\r\nto carry four culverins, four demi-culverins, and two brass sakers,\r\nbut subsequently two demi-cannon were added, and the strain of this\r\narmament proved too great for both their sailing and seagoing qualities.\r\nTheir demi-cannon were mostly stored in hold at sea, instead of being\r\non deck.[1096] They were afterwards said to have been built in haste,\r\n‘of mean, sappy timber, for particular service,’[1097] and to be weakly\r\nconstructed, costing relatively large sums to maintain in serviceable\r\ncondition; they were used a good deal for winter service in the four\r\nseas, and only one of them lived into the days of the Commonwealth. Two\r\nwere lost returning from Rochelle; and by 1631 the sixth and seventh\r\nwhelps had disappeared from the lists, the seventh by the simple process\r\nof sending the gunner into the magazine with a naked light while she was\r\nin action with a Dunkirker. The fifth was lost in July 1637, and her\r\nexperience of straining till she took in water through her closed ports,\r\nand opened her seams, was probably that undergone by most of those that\r\nfoundered.[1098] The fourth whelp was handed over ‘for a design to be\r\npractised on by a Dutchman’s project,’ and she passes out of the Navy\r\nlist.[1099] These whelps were the first representatives, in intention,\r\nalthough not in form, of the regular sloop and gunboat class afterwards\r\nso largely used for minor police purposes.\r\n\r\nDuring the years of foreign warfare it was found easier to turn suitable\r\nprizes into men-of-war than to arrive at the money necessary for new\r\nships, but from 1632 until the commencement of domestic trouble it\r\nwill be seen that vessels were added in regular succession. It will be\r\nobserved in the preceding list of ships that a keel length of three\r\ntimes the beam was, roughly, the ratio in favour during the middle of the\r\nreign, while on reference to the Elizabethan Navy list, the proportion\r\nin the majority is seen to be one of about two and a half times the\r\nbreadth. Whether the alteration was due to theoretical calculation or to\r\nstudy of the lines of foreign ships we have no means of deciding, but\r\nthe increase in length is still more pronounced in the vessels launched\r\nin 1646 and 1647, their keels being sometimes nearly three and a half\r\ntimes their beam. According to Pepys this last improvement was due to\r\nPett’s observation of a French ship lying in the river, in which case\r\nthe French designers had already obtained that superiority in the art of\r\nshipbuilding which they held until speed became a matter of engine power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The new Ships.]\r\n\r\nThe cost of the _Charles_ and _Henrietta Maria_ was £10,849, and of\r\nlaunching and taking them from Woolwich to Chatham, £1222; that of the\r\n_James_ and _Unicorn_ came to £12,632,[1100] the increased totals as\r\ncompared with the _St George_ and _St Andrew_, of the previous reign,\r\nbeing attributed to sounder workmanship and higher prices for labour and\r\nmaterials. A further sum of £4076, was paid on the _James_ and _Unicorn_\r\nfor ‘rigging, launching, furnishing, and transporting’ them from Woolwich\r\nand Deptford to Chatham, work which included 65 tons of cordage at £35\r\na ton, 214 cwt. of anchors at £2 per cwt., suits of sails at £225 a\r\nsuit, waistcloths and top armours of red cloth for both £132,[1101] and\r\ntrumpeters and pipes at their launch, £15.[1102] The King and Queen were\r\npresent at the launch of these vessels, and £14, 5s 4d was spent in\r\nsweetmeats for them and their attendants. Pennington wrote to the Lords\r\nof the Admiralty that the _Vanguard_ and the _Henrietta Maria_ were both\r\ngood ships, although the latter was ‘extraordinarily housed in aloft;’\r\nprivately, to Nicholas, he said that there had been ‘great abuse both in\r\nmaterials and workmanship.’[1103] When he had to try the _Unicorn_ he in\r\nthat instance gave his unfavourable report directly to the Admiralty.\r\nOn joining at Tilbury he found her so crank that she could carry no\r\nsail. Three shipwrights on board—Ed. Boate, who built her, Pett, and\r\nAustin—persuaded him to take in another hundred tons of ballast, and the\r\nextra weight brought her so low that the gun-deck ports had to be caulked\r\nup, as ‘in a reasonable gale of wind’ she would lay them under water.\r\nPennington was still unwilling to venture out with the ship, ‘but in\r\nregard to the poor man’s disgrace that built her,’ he gave her a trial at\r\nsea, and decides that she ‘is dangerous and unserviceable,’ cannot work\r\nher guns, and will not live in a gale.[1104]\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the authorities naturally desired to be\r\ninformed by the Trinity House experts and the masters of the Shipwrights’\r\nCompany why they had given a certificate approving the _Unicorn_. They\r\nanswered that they thought she would be a failure, ‘but rather than\r\ndisgrace any workman they put their hands, hoping the ship might prove\r\nwell.’[1105] The defence sounds weakly benevolent, but that they were\r\neither too ignorant themselves to judge, or that the ganglionic plexus\r\nof fraud uniting most officials made them unwilling to venture on such\r\na dangerous novelty as an honest opinion, is much more likely than that\r\nthey were actuated by goodwill towards each other, a feeling they always\r\nsuccessfully suppressed where hostile criticism could be safely hazarded.\r\n‘The bruits of this disaster have spread far and wide,’ wrote Edisbury,\r\nand many opinions were obtained as to the best course to take, the\r\ndiscussion ending in girdling her, a method which increased her stiffness\r\nat the expense of her speed. The _Unicorn’s_ ports were intended to be 5\r\nfeet above the water line, but they proved to be but 3 feet 7 inches from\r\nit. ‘The King’s ships are not built as they should be, nor like merchant\r\nships,’ Pennington complained.[1106]\r\n\r\nThe _Roebuck_ and _Greyhound_ of 1636 were built from the waste of the\r\n_Sovereign_, then on the stocks, and the _Providence_ and _Expedition_\r\nin 1637 were finished in time to join Rainsborow before Sallee, vessels\r\nof lighter draught than those he had with him, but of some force, being\r\nrequired. The other accessions of 1636, the _Swan_ and _Nicodemus_ were\r\nboth Dunkirk prizes, and added to the Navy as being the fastest vessels\r\nafloat. Pennington recommended that the _Swan_ should be used as a model\r\nby English builders, and the _Nicodemus_ was said to run away from\r\neverything, ‘as a greyhound does from a little dog.’\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shipwrights’ Errors.]\r\n\r\nNoticing the general discrepancies between designs and results in\r\nshipbuilding, Charles II remarked a generation later of Christopher Pett,\r\nwhen he turned out a successful ship, ‘I am sure it must be God put him\r\nin the way, for no art of his own could ever have done it.’ An observer\r\nof this date, Kenrick Edisbury, who succeeded Sir Thos. Aylesbury as\r\nSurveyor of the Navy, perhaps better qualified to judge, attributed\r\npart of the apparent error rather to self-interest. ‘I never yet knew,’\r\nhe writes to Nicholas, ‘any ship built by day-work but the shipwrights\r\nhave made them of greater burden than their warrants mentioned, as you\r\nmay discern by this new ship now in building at Deptford, which I am\r\npersuaded will prove 200 tons greater than was appointed.’[1107] Edisbury\r\nwas referring to either the _Leopard_ or the _Swallow_, and there is\r\nan instructive paper relating to these two vessels which shows the\r\nlack of exactness, whether due to ignorance or intention. It gives the\r\nmeasurements as ordered by the King—the shipwrights intrusted with the\r\nwork received their instructions from him personally[1108]—and as they\r\nactually were.[1109]\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------+---------+---------+-------------+\r\n  |                                |         |         | ‘Dimensions |\r\n  |                                |_Leopard_|_Swallow_|   given by  |\r\n  |                                |         |         |his majestie’|\r\n  |                                +---------+---------+-------------+\r\n  |                                |  Feet   |  Feet   |   Feet      |\r\n  |Keel                            |   95    |   96    |    93       |\r\n  |Beam inside the plank           |   33    |   32.2  |    31       |\r\n  |Depth from upper edge of keel  }|         |         |             |\r\n  |   to diameter of breadth      }|   12.4  |   11.7½ |             |\r\n  |Depth of keel                   |    1.7  |    1.8  |             |\r\n  |Rake of stem                    |   30.6  |   28.4  |    27       |\r\n  |Rake of stern post              |    4.3  |    4.8  |     4       |\r\n  |The flat of the floor           |   13    |   13    |    13       |\r\n  |Midship draught                 |   12.9  |   12.3  |    11.6     |\r\n  |Distance of lower edge of port }|         |         |             |\r\n  |   from greatest breadth       }|    5    |    4.10½|     5.6     |\r\n  |Distance between ports          |8.6 and 9|    8    |     8       |\r\n  |From deck to lower edge of ports|    2.1  |    2.1  |     2.2     |\r\n  |Breadth of ports                |    2.4  |    2.4  |     2.4     |\r\n  |Depth of ports                  |    2.2  |    2.2  |     2.4     |\r\n  |From the diameter of breadth   }|         |         |             |\r\n  |   to the top of the waist     }|   13.6  |   12.7  |             |\r\n  |Between decks                   |    6.6  |    6.7  |     6.8     |\r\n  |Gross tonnage                   |  515    |  478    |   384       |\r\n  +--------------------------------+---------+---------+-------------+\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Report on the Ships.]\r\n\r\nIn January 1626-7 we have a report on the qualities of the new ships\r\nadded since 1618, and built under Burrell’s superintendence while he was\r\nthe Commissioners’ principal subordinate. The _Constant Reformation_ is\r\nsaid to be strongly built and seaworthy, but cannot work her lower tier\r\nin a moderate sea; the _Victory_ weakly built and crank, as is also the\r\n_Garland_ which is a slow sailer as well. The _Swiftsure_, _Bonaventure_,\r\nand _Mary Rose_ are all condemned as badly built, crank, or slow under\r\nsail. The _St George_, _St Andrew_, and _Triumph_ are awarded faint\r\npraise. It must, however, be remembered that this survey was made by\r\nBurrell’s professional competitors, of whose envy and jealousy there\r\nis incidental evidence yet remaining, and that at least five of these\r\nvessels, after years of sailing and fighting round half the world,\r\nare to be found still fit for service in the Navy lists of Charles\r\nII. The Commissioners claimed that, with the exception of the earlier\r\n_Bonaventure_, theirs were the first additions to the Navy that could\r\ncarry out their guns ‘in all fighting weathers.’\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sovereign of the Seas.]\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to describe the _Sovereign of the Seas_, accounts\r\nof which, based on Thos. Heywood’s well-known tract,[1110] have been\r\nseveral times given in various works. Some details, however, not known\r\nto Heywood, may be given here. The suggestion must have been under\r\ndiscussion for some time, but the first mention of her is in August\r\n1634, when the masters of the Trinity House, apparently without being\r\nasked for it, volunteered an opinion that such a ship was an impossible\r\ndream.[1111] Their dogmatic statement that a three-decker was a thing\r\n‘beyond the art or wit of man to construct,’ has already been quoted,\r\nbut they further insisted that, if built, there was no port, ‘the Isle\r\nof Wight only’ excepted, in which she could ride, and no ground tackle\r\nwhich would hold her. No notice seems to have been taken of their long\r\nand poetically expressed effusion, and in January 1635 an estimate was\r\ncalled for of a vessel of 1500 tons, (‘the king with his own hand hath\r\nset down the burden;‘), and in March, Phineas Pett was ordered to prepare\r\na model of ‘the ship royal,’ and was told that ‘you principally are\r\nappointed by his majesty for the building of the same.’[1112] A month\r\nlater Pennington, Mansell, Phineas Pett, and John Wells[1113] met, and\r\nagreed on dimensions, which were substantially those afterwards adopted,\r\nand the gross tonnage was to be by depth 1466 tons, by draught 1661 tons,\r\nand by beam 1836 tons; but no explanation is given of the way in which\r\nthese figures are arrived at.[1114] Pett’s estimate of the cost was\r\n£13,680;[1115] perhaps he really did not know, perhaps he did not wish\r\nto frighten Charles, but the amount eventually spent on her, exclusive\r\nof guns, was £40,833 8s 1½d.[1116] Comparing this sum with the £5500 to\r\n£6500 which was the average cost of a forty-gun ship, there must have\r\nbeen, even allowing for the much larger proportion spent in decoration of\r\nvarious kinds, great extravagance in some respects.\r\n\r\nBefore commencing work Pett desired that the principal officers, who,\r\nhe said, had always shown themselves adverse, should neither provide\r\nmaterials nor make any payments without his signed order. ‘Already\r\nI find certain extraordinary unnecessary charges of new building of\r\ndwelling-houses bestowed and employed in Woolwich yard, which I doubt\r\nnot will be brought upon the charge of the ship.’[1117] As this was\r\noccurring while the trees which were to form her frame were yet in leaf\r\nin Chopwell and Brancepeth woods, it gives us an interesting glimpse into\r\nthe habits of the chief Officers of the Navy, and the estimation in which\r\nthey were held by one who was brought into daily contact with them. The\r\nkeel was laid at Woolwich, in the presence of Charles, on 16th January\r\n1636, and she was launched in October 1637. Pett had recommended that\r\nthe launching should be deferred till the spring, since the vessel would\r\ngrow foul lying in the river through the winter, and would then require\r\nredocking. Pett’s proposal was annotated by the king, ‘I am not of your\r\nopinion.’[1118] Charles had a dull optimism, unshaken by any number of\r\nblunders, in the value of a royal opinion, whether applied to subjects\r\nof general policy or to such a technical matter as the rate at which a\r\nship’s hull was likely to grow foul.[1119]\r\n\r\nThe wages bill on the _Sovereign_ amounted to £20,948, and joining,\r\npainting, and carving to £6691; but in the case of this ship the large\r\nsum spent in decoration has in popular imagination, as expressed in\r\npictures and descriptions, implied an equivalent expenditure on other\r\nships which did not really occur. Where details are given of the cost of\r\nmen-of-war, or of their repairs, the money spent on ornamental carving\r\nand painting bears a very small proportion to the total; and it is quite\r\nlikely that the conventional representations of sixteenth and earlier\r\nseventeenth century vessels are altogether wrong in this respect, and\r\nthat men-of-war of these times, at any rate those of the second, third,\r\nand fourth ranks, were little more bedecked than modern merchantmen.\r\nThe manner in which the adornments of the _Prince_ and _Sovereign_ are\r\ndescribed and dwelt upon as out of the common points to the probability\r\nthat other ships possessed few of these external attractions. The\r\n_Elizabeth_ and _Triumph_, the _Ark Royal_ and _Merhonour_ were as\r\nrelatively important in their day as the _Prince_ and _Sovereign_,\r\nbut, with the exceptions already noticed under the reign of Elizabeth,\r\nallusion to any special ornamentation is in their case exceptional,\r\nstill less, then, would the smaller vessels be much beautified by gold,\r\ncolours, and carving. Decoration, perhaps, became much more general\r\nand expensive after the Restoration; but John Holland attributed the\r\nincreased expenditure on it that began about now to the absence of\r\ncontrol over the master shipwrights, who were permitted to do much as\r\nthey liked and would not be outdone by each other.\r\n\r\nThe _Sovereign_ being afloat, the next proceeding was to arm her, and\r\nfor this purpose 102 brass guns were required, costing, by estimation,\r\n£24,753, 8s 8d.[1120] They were thus divided:—\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------+-----------------------+------+------+---------+\r\n  |                       |        Number         |Length|Weight|  Total  |\r\n  |                       |                       | each | each |         |\r\n  |                       +-----------------------+------+------+---------+\r\n  |                       |                       | Ft.  | Cwt. |Tons Cwt.|\r\n  |_Lower tier_—          |                       |      |      |         |\r\n  |  Luffs, quarters, and |                       |      |      |         |\r\n  |    sides              |20 cannon drakes[1121] | 9    | 45  }|         |\r\n  |  Stern chasers        |4 demi-cannon drakes   |12½   | 53  }| 64   16 |\r\n  |  Fore chasers         |2     ”         ”      |11½   | 48  }|         |\r\n  |  Bows abaft the chase |2     ”         ”      |10    | 44  }|         |\r\n  |_Middle tier_—         |                       |      |      |         |\r\n  |  Luffs, quarters, and |                       |      |      |         |\r\n  |    sides              |24 culverin drakes     | 8½   | 28  }|         |\r\n  |  Fore chase           |2 culverins            |11½   | 48  }| 45    4 |\r\n  |  After chase          |4    ”                 |11½   | 48  }|         |\r\n  |_Upper tier_—          |                       |      |      |         |\r\n  |  Sides                |24 demi-culverin drakes| 8½   | 18  }|         |\r\n  |  Fore chase           |2 demi-culverins       |10    | 30  }| 27   12 |\r\n  |  After chase          |    ”      ”           |10    | 30  }|         |\r\n  |Forecastle             |8 demi-culverin drakes | 9    | 20   |  8    0 |\r\n  |Half-deck              |6     ”           ”    | 9    | 20   |  6    0 |\r\n  |Quarter-deck           |2     ”           ”    | 5½   |  8   |      16 |\r\n  |Bulkhead abaft the     |2 culverin drakes      | 5½   | 11   |  1    2 |\r\n  |  forecastle           |                       |      |      |         |\r\n  +-----------------------+-----------------------+------+------+---------+\r\n\r\nThe first estimate was for 90 guns, and here again we read, ‘His majesty\r\nhas since altered his resolution both in respect of the number and nature\r\nof pieces.’ If Pett originally designed the ship for 90 lighter guns,\r\nand Charles raised the number and weight by a stroke of the pen to 102,\r\ntrying to ignore, in the plenitude of his royal power, such things as\r\nmetacentres and centres of gravity, it is not surprising that she proved\r\ntopheavy at sea. It was one of those cases in which ignorance is bliss,\r\nbut, without reading modern scientific knowledge into the past, we know\r\nhe had professional advisers at hand whose empirical skill was sufficient\r\nto enable them to warn him of the folly of such a change. The guns were\r\nengraved—at a cost of £3 each—with the rose and crown, sceptre and\r\ntrident, and anchor and cable. In a compartment under the rose and crown\r\nwas the inscription, _Carolus Edgari sceptrum stabilivit aquarum_, ‘being\r\na scutcheon and motto appointed by his majesty.’[1122] In January 1640\r\noccurs an estimate for a sister ship to the _Sovereign_; but of this, of\r\ncourse, nothing more was ever heard.[1123]\r\n\r\nWe have no station list for the _Sovereign_, as for the _Henry Grace\r\nà Dieu_ but, as a part of ordinary discipline, divisions or quarters\r\nseem to have been usual. There is a station list of this period for a\r\nvessel of 40 guns and 250 men which may be considered typical.[1124] The\r\nheavy guns required 136 men, and 50 more formed the small arms company.\r\nThe boatswain and his mate had 40 under their command to work the ship\r\nunder the orders of the master and his mate, who were attended by 2 men.\r\nThe carpenter and his mates had 6 men, the cook, steward, and surgeon,\r\neach 2 for assistants, and 4 men were told off to steer, and 4 to remain\r\nwith the trumpeters. Finally the captain and lieutenant had 2 men in\r\nattendance. The heaviest guns were allowed 5 men each; and the number\r\nvaried down to 5 men between two of the smaller guns.\r\n\r\nOf the eight vessels of 1646 and 1647 there is nothing to say beyond once\r\nmore noticing the marked increase in the ratio between length and beam.\r\nThere is not to be found, among the Commonwealth papers, any mention in\r\npraise or dispraise of their weatherly and fighting qualities, and from\r\nthis silence we may infer that they were found to be, in essentials, all\r\nthat was expected.\r\n\r\nProbably a sixteenth or seventeenth century ship was not a particularly\r\npicturesque object. Instead of the graceful, beautifully proportioned\r\nhulls, spars, and sails of to-day, the reader must imagine a short,\r\nsquat, hull, round-bowed and square-sterned, enormously high and broad\r\nin comparison with its length, and the sides falling in towards each\r\nother till the upper deck was perhaps only two-thirds of the width on\r\nthe water line. The stern was the highest part of the ship, and the bows\r\nthe lowest, so that she looked as though she was always premeditating a\r\nplunge forward, and the longitudinal curve of the sides was broken by\r\nhuge channels opposite each mast to which were fastened the shrouds.\r\nAbove, the stumpy masts and spars must have looked ridiculously out of\r\nproportion to the ponderous hull, although they were in reality usually\r\ntoo heavy in relation to the badly designed and placed weights below. As\r\nfor the gilt and painting, a week of rough weather would have converted\r\nthe original tawdry splendour into a forlorn slatternliness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The remaining Elizabethan Ships.]\r\n\r\nMost of the remaining Elizabethan ships passed out of the service. The\r\nhull of the _Bear_ was sold in 1629 for £315, the _Answer_ and _Crane_\r\nfor £101, and towards the end of the reign, the _Dreadnought_, _Due\r\nRepulse_, _Adventure_, and _Assurance_ were broken up. In 1635 Charles,\r\nagain exemplifying the very real interference, if not control, he\r\nexercised in naval matters, ordered, against the recommendations of the\r\nPrincipal Officers, that the _Warspite_ should be cut down into a lighter\r\nfor harbour service at Portsmouth. But the most serious loss in this\r\nclass was that of the _Anne Royal_, which in April 1636, when fitted as\r\nNorthumberland’s flagship, was bilged on her own anchor when bringing\r\nto in the river. The disaster was attributed to the pilot and master\r\ngiving contradictory orders, and when she was lying on her broadside and\r\nfull of water her officers made matters worse by cutting holes in the\r\nupper side to recover their belongings.[1125] Of course nine members of\r\nthe Trinity House at once certified that it was impossible to raise the\r\n_Anne_, just as a year before they had petitioned against the Foreland\r\nlights as ‘useless and unnecessary,’[1126] and just as on every point\r\nreferred to them they showed a persistence in being stultified by events,\r\nextraordinary even in a corporation. Two townsmen of Great Yarmouth\r\noffered to float the ship for £2000; the Principal Officers thought they\r\ncould do it for £1450, and eventually they did raise her, but with the\r\ncustomary variation in official calculations, at a charge of £5355.[1127]\r\nShe was taken to the East India Company’s dock at Blackwall, and there,\r\nbeing found to be too severely damaged for repair, broken up.\r\n\r\nOf the later ships, the _Phœnix_ and _Nonsuch_ were sold; the\r\n_Reformation_, _Antelope_, _Swallow_, and _Convertine_ were carried\r\noff by the mutineers of 1648 and lost to the English Navy, and most\r\nof the prizes of the earlier years were subsequently given to private\r\nindividuals or to commercial associations. The King had no fleet\r\nafter 1642, and seized upon any expedient likely to give him one. In\r\nNovember 1643 he granted a commission to Jeronimo Cæsar de Caverle as\r\nVice-admiral, De Caverle contracting to obtain, man, and fit out five\r\nships for £2000 a month, to be paid out of any prizes he might take from\r\nthe supporters of the Parliament.[1128] This, like Rupert’s commission,\r\nwas a premium on piracy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The French Navy.]\r\n\r\nNot the least interesting of the papers of this reign are those which\r\nshow what a close watch was kept on the growth of the nascent French\r\nnavy. In 1625 Louis was compelled to borrow vessels from Charles, but\r\nin 1626 Richelieu bought up or confiscated local or opposing rights and\r\nconstituted himself head of the navy, assisted by a _conseil de marine_.\r\nThat which must have been the nucleus of his fleet, the purchase of four\r\nvessels built for him in the Low Countries, is duly reported to our\r\nKing.[1129] Again in 1627 there are several notices of fresh purchases\r\nfrom the Dutch, and in September Mervyn was ordered to intercept and\r\ndestroy them on their passage to France.[1130] By this time the French\r\nhad thirty-three ships before Rochelle, but eighteen of them were under\r\n200 tons each, and probably most were hired merchantmen.[1131] In 1630\r\nten ‘dragones’ were being built at Havre in imitation of the whelps, and\r\na correspondent, writing from Bordeaux, says that there are ‘so many good\r\nships of the King of France’s navy that unless I had been an eye-witness\r\nthereof I should not have believed it possible.’[1132] There were forty\r\nships ‘of good force’ there. In 1631 Charles appears to have obtained a\r\ndetailed list of the then existing French marine, thus classified:—[1133]\r\n\r\n  +--------+----+----+----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n  |        | 900| 700| 600|  500  |  450  |  400  |  300  |  250  |  200  |\r\n  |        |tons|tons|tons| tons  | tons  | tons  | tons  | tons  | tons  |\r\n  |        |    |    |    |   &   |   &   |   &   |   &   |   &   |   &   |\r\n  |        |    |    |    |40 guns|36 guns|34 guns|28 guns|23 guns|18 guns|\r\n  +--------+----+----+----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n  |Brest   |  1 |  2 |  3 |   6   |       |   2   |   1   |       |   1   |\r\n  |Bordeaux|    |    |    |   3   |   3   |   1   |       |       |   1   |\r\n  |Blaye   |    |    |    |   1   |       |   1   |       |       |   1   |\r\n  |Brouage |    |    |    |       |       |   1   |   2   |   1   |   2   |\r\n  |St. Malo|    |    |    |   1   |       |   1   |   1   |       |       |\r\n  |At sea  |    |    |    |   1   |       |       |   1   |       |   1   |\r\n  +--------+----+----+----+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+\r\n\r\nThere were also two of 1400 and 700 tons, respectively, building. It\r\nmust be confessed that this force, created within five years and manned\r\nby Breton and Norman seamen, was calculated to give pause to the rulers\r\nof the painfully maintained English Navy. Still more significant was\r\nthe fact that only twelve were Dutch-built; Richelieu had soon freed\r\nFrance from dependence on foreign artisans. The proportion of guns on\r\nFrench vessels was smaller than that on English vessels of corresponding\r\ntonnage, an excess of metal having been characteristic of our equipment\r\nuntil the eighteenth century. In 1639 their strength had so far increased\r\nthat they had forty sail and ten fireships in the Channel, and there was\r\nalso a powerful Dutch fleet, so that Pennington was directed to stop any\r\nsuitable merchantmen and add them to his squadron.\r\n\r\nA navy, however, which was not the result of natural growth, but depended\r\non the energy and will of one man, was predestined to decay. The French\r\nmarine, as Professor Laughton has pointed out, really began with\r\nColbert, and in 1661, when he took office, it was reduced to less than\r\n20 seaworthy vessels, against some 150 carried on the English Navy list.\r\nThe rivalry still existing between the two nations commenced very early.\r\nAs soon as the _Sovereign_ was built, a similar ship was considered a\r\nnecessity for France, but for some reason it was not until 1657 that\r\ntheir first three-decker was launched.[1134]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tonnage Measurement.]\r\n\r\nClosely connected with shipping was the question of tonnage, and the\r\ndiscussion which raged between 1626-8 on the methods of calculating it\r\nwould require a volume for its full elucidation. The existing rule was\r\nrecognised as imperfect, but the science of the time was not able to\r\nformulate anything satisfactory in its place, for exact measurement has\r\nbeen a matter only of the present century. The following paper, printed\r\nin full, may be regarded as representing the various views existing, and\r\nwill at any rate show how little dependence can be placed on any positive\r\nstatement of a ship’s tonnage.[1135]\r\n\r\n    There are three ways of measuring ships now in use:—\r\n\r\n    _Mr Baker’s Old Way_—The old way, which was established in\r\n    Queen Elizabeth’s time, and never questioned all King James his\r\n    time, is this: The length of the keel, leaving out the false\r\n    post, if there be any. Multiply by the greatest breadth within\r\n    the plank, and that product by the depth taken from the breadth\r\n    to the upper edge of the keel produceth a solid number which\r\n    divided by 100 gives the contents in tons, into which add one\r\n    third part for tonnage, so have you the tons and tonnage.\r\n\r\n                    The _Adventure_ of Ipswich\r\n\r\n                                 ft.\r\n    Length                      63·6  1802  7737\r\n    Breadth                     26·2  1417  8037 Within yᵉ plank.\r\n    Depth                       11    1041  3927 To yᵉ upper edge\r\n                                                   of keel.\r\n    Divisor                    100      70\r\n    Tons                    182,80    1261  9701\r\n    One third for tonnage    60,93[1136]\r\n                            ------\r\n                            243,73 tons and tonnage.\r\n\r\n    It is credibly averred by Sir H. Mervyn and Sir H. Palmer that\r\n    the old way of measuring was to take the breadth without yᵉ\r\n    plank and the depth from the breadth to the lower edge of the\r\n    keel. And this was Baker’s way of measuring.\r\n\r\n    _Second Way_—The second way is assumed by the shipwrights of\r\n    the river to be the old way, but it is not, which makes the\r\n    ship to be 28 in the hundred greater than the former, and is\r\n    this: The length of the keel taken as before, or ought to be.\r\n    The breadth from outside the plank to outside. The depth or\r\n    draught of water from the breadth to the bottom of the keel\r\n    all multiplied together and divided by 94 (say they) give the\r\n    content in tons, into which add one third for tonnage.\r\n\r\n                                 ft.\r\n    Length                      63.6  1802  7737\r\n    Breadth                     26.8  1426   230 Without yᵉ timber\r\n                                                   and plank.\r\n    Depth                       12.3  1088  1361 To yᵉ lower edge\r\n                                                   of keel.\r\n    Divisor                     94    8026  8721\r\n    Tons                    220,71\r\n    One third for tonnage    73,57\r\n                             -----\r\n                            294,28 tons and tonnage.\r\n\r\n    If you divide this by 100 (which is said to be here done by 94)\r\n    it is yᵉ true old way, called Baker’s way.\r\n\r\n    _Third Way_—The third way was proposed by Mr Gunter, Mr Pett,\r\n    Mr Stevens, Mr Lyddiard, and myself, who were required by\r\n    warrant from my lord Duke of Buckingham and the commissioners\r\n    for the navy (then being) to measure the _Adventure_ of\r\n    Ipswich, the greatest bilged ship in the river, and from her\r\n    dimensions to frame a rule that in our best judgments might\r\n    be indifferently applicable to all kinds of frames. This we\r\n    performed and yielded our reasons for it, which, to avoid the\r\n    abuse of furred sides and deep keels and standing strakes,\r\n    which increaseth the burden but not the hold, was thus: the\r\n    length by the keel as the first; the depth in hold from the\r\n    breadth to the seeling;[1137] the mean breadth within that\r\n    seeling at half that depth multiplied together, and the product\r\n    divided by 65, gives the tons, into which add one third part\r\n    for tonnage.\r\n\r\n                                ft.\r\n    Length                      63.6  1802  7737\r\n    Mean breadth                22    1342  4227  Within the\r\n                                                    seeling.\r\n    Depth                        9.8   985  4265  To the seeling.\r\n    Divisor                     65    8187  866\r\n    Tons                    207,83    2317  7095\r\n    One third for tonnage    69,27\r\n                            ------\r\n                            277,10[1138] This increaseth 12 per\r\n                                           100 above the old rule.\r\n\r\n    There is a fourth way, devised by the shipwrights and Trinity\r\n    masters, but exploded for the great excess which makes the\r\n    ship 30 in the hundred greater than the first, and it is thus:\r\n    length of the keel as at first, middle breadth beneath the\r\n    greatest, viz. the breadth at the wrunghead, depth to the\r\n    outside of the plank, all multiplied together and divided by 70.\r\n\r\n                                ft.\r\n    Length                      63.6  1372  5438\r\n    Middle breadth              23.7  1051  1525  Without (_i.e._\r\n                                                    outside) timber\r\n                                                    and plank.\r\n    Depth                       11.3  1802  7737  Without the plank.\r\n    Divisor                     70    8154  9019\r\n    Tons                    240,68    1381  3719\r\n    One third for tonnage    80,22\r\n                            ------\r\n                            320,90\r\n\r\nAlthough this document is quoted at length as showing the opposing views,\r\nthe controversy began in May 1626, when Wells, Stevens, and others sent\r\nin an interesting paper,[1139] which is the one referred to in their\r\n‘third way’ of the preceding, too long to transcribe fully, but from\r\nwhich some extracts may be given. The main question was whether the depth\r\nand breadth should be taken from within or without board. In the second\r\ncase the King paid for more tonnage in a hired ship, especially if she\r\nwas furred or girdled, than he actually obtained, but the first was held\r\nto be a direct incentive to owners to build flimsily. The _Adventure_ of\r\nIpswich was all through the subject of experiment. They say:—\r\n\r\n    We consider the ship may be considered three ways—the first in\r\n    cask, and so two butts or four hogsheads make a ton; the second\r\n    in feet, and so forty feet of timber make a ton, the third in\r\n    weight and so twenty hundred weight make a ton.... The first\r\n    seems most rational to us.... We therefore first prescribe\r\n    the hold of the ship to be the cavity of the vessel contained\r\n    between the lines of her greatest breadth and depth withinboard\r\n    ... supposing the lower edge of the (deck) beams to be pitched\r\n    at the breadth.... We next consider what quantity of cask may\r\n    be stowed in this hold first by drawing the bends and the form\r\n    of the cask in each several bend; but this way being subject\r\n    to error we sought the true contents thereof arithmetically,\r\n    allowing 4½ feet to the length of a butt, and 2 ft. 8 in. to\r\n    the depth of the first tier, but 2 ft. 4 in. for the rest of\r\n    the tiers. This whole body we reduce into feet, and divide the\r\n    product thereof by sixty, because we find by calculation that a\r\n    ton of cask stowed to the best advantage will take up as much\r\n    room as sixty feet solid, and by these means we produce the\r\n    whole contents of the _Adventure’s_ hold to be 207 tons.\r\n\r\nThey then proceed to frame the rule they used in the ‘third way’ of the\r\npaper of 1627, and notice that practically the _Adventure_ takes a cargo\r\nof about 276 tons of coal, but that this brings her midship port within a\r\nfoot of the water line and renders her unfit for any service. In June the\r\nmasters of the Trinity House commented on the preceding statement,[1140]\r\nand began by declaring that ‘truly to find the contents of the cavity of\r\nthe hold in cask is not possible.’ They strongly maintained that vessels\r\nshould be measured from without board, seeing that a furred ship could\r\ncarry more than if unfurred, ignoring the fact that one object of the\r\nproposed new rule was to insure more accurate designing and building by\r\nthrowing the loss on the owner. ‘The old rule,’ they said, ‘is less true\r\nfor lately built ships, which have great floors, but true for old ships\r\nwith small floors.’[1141] Their protest evoked a derisive reply from the\r\ngovernment shipwrights, from which it is unnecessary to quote.[1142]\r\nFinally an order was issued, 26th May 1628, that all the King’s ships and\r\nthose hired by him should be measured by taking ‘the length of the keel,\r\nleaving out the false post, the greatest breadth within the plank, the\r\ndepth from that breadth to the upper edge of the keel,’ multiplying these\r\nand dividing by one hundred.[1143]\r\n\r\nThe result of the change was to make vessels apparently smaller, but\r\nwhether nearer to, or further from, what we should now consider their\r\nreal tonnage we have no means of deciding conclusively. The comparative\r\nmeasurements of two ships by the old and the new rules may serve as\r\nexample of the others:—[1144]\r\n\r\n  +-----------------+--------------+-------------+----------+-------------+\r\n  |                 |     Keel     |     Beam    |  Depth   |Gross tonnage|\r\n  +-----------------+--------------+-------------+----------+-------------+\r\n  |                 |Old    New    |Old      New |Old   New | Old   New   |\r\n  |                 |rule   rule   |rule     rule|rule  rule| rule  rule  |\r\n  |                 |              |[1145] [1146]|          |             |\r\n  |                 | ft.    ft.   | ft.      ft.| ft.   ft.|             |\r\n  |_Henrietta Maria_|106    106    |36.5     35.9|16.6  15.8|  848   793  |\r\n  |_Charles_        |106.4  105.2  |36.3     35.7|16.6  16.3|  848   810  |\r\n  |                 |       [1147] |             |          |             |\r\n  +-----------------+--------------+-------------+----------+-------------+\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Merchant Marine.]\r\n\r\nThe extensive use made of hired ships between 1625 and 1628 led\r\nto several lists being drawn up of the available merchant marine.\r\nBefore, however, dealing with these, there is another source from\r\nwhich information may be gained. The Trinity House certificates, from\r\nMay 1625 to March 1638, of new ships requiring ordnance, and which\r\nwere necessarily sent to London to be armed, have fortunately been\r\npreserved.[1148] These certificates probably include every new vessel of\r\nany considerable size, and in most cases mention the tonnage and place\r\nof construction, and from them, therefore, we can draw fairly reliable\r\nconclusions concerning the relative importance of the shipping centres\r\nwhere they were built, and the strength of the merchant navy. In these\r\nthirteen years some 380 ships come under notice, inclusive of fifteen\r\nprizes and twenty-two bought, mostly from the Dutch, but whether new or\r\nold is not stated. The following table gives the number each year:—\r\n\r\n  1625, 5\r\n  1626, 124\r\n  1627, 23\r\n  1628, 5\r\n  1629, 55\r\n  1630, 37\r\n  1631, 18\r\n  1632, 11\r\n  1633, 12\r\n  1634, 12\r\n  1635, 24\r\n  1636, 25\r\n  1637, 24\r\n  1638, 5 (three months)\r\n\r\nThe sudden increase of 1626 is probably attributable to the number of\r\nvessels taken up for the royal service, and to the proclamation of 26th\r\nApril of that year, by which the bounty of 5s a ton on craft of over\r\n100 tons, and suited for warfare, was renewed. The subsequent falling\r\noff, besides being a natural reaction, may have been also due to the\r\ndifficulty owners experienced in obtaining payment for their ships when\r\nhired by the King. An analysis of the places mentioned yields, when the\r\nport of origin is given, the results tabulated below. The expression\r\n‘River of Thames’ comprises those from various ports, but mostly, perhaps\r\nNewcastle colliers sent up for their ordnance; it may also include those\r\nfrom such a place as Bristol, for which one new ship cannot be a complete\r\nreturn. Ships of under 300 tons are not classified, and in some instances\r\nthe tonnage is not given in the certificate:—\r\n\r\n  +----------------+-----+------------------------+\r\n  |                |Total|         Tons           |\r\n  |                | No. +----+----+----+----+----+\r\n  |                |     | 500| 450|400 | 350| 300|\r\n  +----------------+-----+----+----+----+----+----+\r\n  |London          |     |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  |  Limehouse     |  20 |    |  1 |  2 |  3 |  6 |\r\n  |  Wapping       |  21 |    |    |    |  1 |  2 |\r\n  |  Horseleydown  |  14 |    |    |  1 |  2 |  1 |\r\n  |  Ratcliff      |  19 |    |    |  1 |  3 |  3 |\r\n  |  Deptford      |   2 |  1 |    |  1 |    |    |\r\n  |  Shadwell      |   1 |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  |  Blackwall     |   1 |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  |Ipswich         |  48 |    |    |  1 |    |  7 |\r\n  |Yarmouth        |  26 |    |    |  1 |    |  1 |\r\n  |Aldborough      |  12 |    |    |    |    |  2 |\r\n  |Hull            |  25 |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  |Woodbridge      |  12 |    |    |  1 |  2 |  3 |\r\n  |Colchester      |   7 |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  |River of Thames | 102 |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  |Bristol         |   1 |    |    |    |    |  1 |\r\n  |Harwich         |   2 |    |    |    |  1 |    |\r\n  |Dartmouth       |   3 |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  |Dover           |   2 |    |    |    |    |  1 |\r\n  |Southampton     |   2 |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  |Shoreham        |  14 |    |    |    |    |  5 |\r\n  |Plymouth        |   1 |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  |Weymouth        |   3 |    |    |    |    |  1 |\r\n  |Blakeney        |   1 |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  |Exeter          |   2 |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  +----------------+-----+----+----+----+----+----+\r\n\r\nIn July 1626, Buckingham was directed to procure returns of the number\r\nand size of the ships belonging to the port towns, and the resulting\r\nlist, so far as the reports have survived, is as follows:—[1149]\r\n\r\n  +----------------------+----+-------+--------+\r\n  |                      |No. |Largest|100 tons|\r\n  |                      |    |in tons|   or   |\r\n  |                      |    |       |upwards |\r\n  +----------------------+----+-------+--------+\r\n  |Portsmouth            |  5 |  80   |        |\r\n  |Gosport               | 11 |  40   |        |\r\n  |Isle of Wight         | 10 |  70   |        |\r\n  |Padstow               |  3 |  40   |        |\r\n  |Chester               | 21 |  50   |        |\r\n  |Boston                | 12 |  80   |        |\r\n  |Yarmouth              | 97 | 320(2)|   26   |\r\n  |Dartmouth and Tor Bay | 65 | 270   |   15   |\r\n  |Fowey                 |  2 |  50   |        |\r\n  |Sandwich              | 30 | 240   |   12   |\r\n  |Lynn                  | 67 | 160   |   15   |\r\n  |Wells                 | 26 |  80   |        |\r\n  |Burnham               | 10 |  50   |        |\r\n  |Blakeney              | 14 | 100   |    1   |\r\n  |Plymouth              | 40 | 120   |    7   |\r\n  |Stonehouse            |  6 | 120   |    1   |\r\n  |Saltash and vicinity  | 24 | 200   |    4   |\r\n  |Salcombe              | 11 |  50   |        |\r\n  |E. and W.

In her time Dartmouth, including\r\nTotnes, was the leading southern port, and, although Plymouth and\r\nadjoining towns now run it close, it is hardly yet second. And so far as\r\nthe scanty materials for comparison allow us to judge, it does not appear\r\nthat the relation between the other ports had altered to any important\r\ndegree, although the aggregate of ships belonging to them is much\r\ngreater. Notwithstanding the obvious omissions in this roll, it includes\r\n100 vessels of 100 tons and upwards, against 177 in 1588 for the whole of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIn February 1628 there was a survey of such ships in the Thames as were\r\nfit for the royal service.[1150] There were seven East Indiamen[1151] of\r\n4200 tons and 218 guns, the largest being one of 900, one of 800, and two\r\nof 700 tons; besides thirty-four other merchantmen of 7850 tons and 610\r\nguns, and twenty-two Newcastle colliers of from 200 to 250 tons each. The\r\nlargest of the merchantmen were one of 500 and two of 450 tons. A year\r\nlater, in February and March 1629, there was another survey of London\r\nand other ports, but only of ships of 100 tons and upwards, and there\r\nwere now in the river eight East Indiamen of 5700 tons, one being of 1000\r\ntons, and forty-seven other merchantmen of 12,150 tons, and 906 guns;\r\nthere were also twenty-nine merchantmen of 7060 tons and 556 guns at sea,\r\nthirty Newcastle vessels belonging to London owners, and eighteen other\r\nships of not more than 120 tons each and unarmed.[1152] The following\r\nlist of the remaining towns will complement that of 1626, on which it\r\nshows some variations[1153]:—\r\n\r\n  +---------------+--------+-------+\r\n  |               |100 tons|Largest|\r\n  |               |  and   |       |\r\n  |               |upwards |       |\r\n  +---------------+--------+-------+\r\n  |South Cornwall |    6   |  200  |\r\n  |Plymouth       |    8   |  160  |\r\n  |Dartmouth      |   15   |  200  |\r\n  |Weymouth       |    1   |  110  |\r\n  |Poole          |    1   |  150  |\r\n  |Southampton    |    1   |  100  |\r\n  |Sandwich       |    6   |  200  |\r\n  |Dover          |    7   |  260  |\r\n  |Malden         |    2   |  160  |\r\n  |Colchester     |    9   |  240  |\r\n  |Woodbridge     |   17   |  300  |\r\n  |Harwich        |   11   |  140  |\r\n  |Ipswich        |   63   |  300  |\r\n  |Aldborough     |   14   |  300  |\r\n  |Lynn           |    5   |  120  |\r\n  |Yarmouth       |   26   |  200  |\r\n  |Bristol        |   30   |  250  |\r\n  |South Wales    |    1   |  250  |\r\n  +---------------+--------+-------+\r\n\r\nIncluding London there were, then, in 1629, more than 350 ships of over\r\n100 tons, while Newcastle is only partly, and Yorkshire, Somerset,\r\nChester, and Sussex are not at all mentioned; but the writer of the copy\r\nof 1634 remarks that in the five years that had elapsed since the survey\r\nwas made, ninety-five more such vessels had been built.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Ports.]\r\n\r\nAll the fleets set forth by Charles contained a large proportion of\r\ncolliers, as their cost was supposed to be but one-third of that of\r\nmerchantmen. The growing importance of the coal trade is shown by the\r\nshipment of 143,000 chaldrons (equal to nearly 200,000 tons) of coal from\r\nNewcastle in 1626.[1154] On the other hand, leaving piracy aside for the\r\nmoment, the chances of war and tempest played havoc with the commercial\r\nprosperity of not a few of the coast towns. In 1626 Bristol lost fifty\r\nships by wreck and capture. When, in 1627, these ports were required to\r\nprovide vessels for the King, most of them pleaded inability from these\r\ncauses and losses by pirates. By the embargo in France and Spain Poole\r\nhad lost £8500, and had to maintain 400 widows and children; Exeter,\r\nfrom the same cause, had lost £80,000 and ‘in many parishes there is\r\nnot one man of ability to a hundred poor people.’ Barnstaple and Totnes\r\nreplied that the crown owed them money for billeted soldiers, and that\r\nuntil payment was made they were powerless. Norwich was ‘in a desolate\r\nand distressed condition,’ as was also Harwich; and Aldborough in three\r\nyears had lost thirteen ships, and had three hundred widows and children\r\nto keep. The port of Boston was choked up, and its big ships all sold.\r\nDartmouth, Penryn, and Lyme Regis professed to be nearly ruined by the\r\nembargo laid on their ships and goods in France and Spain, while most of\r\ntheir remaining merchantmen were unemployed and they had many poor to\r\nsupport. Plymouth was ordered to supply two vessels of 200 tons each;\r\nthey said they were in a distressed and miserable state, that since 1624\r\nthey had lost by pirates and embargo £44,000, that the crown owed £6000\r\nin the town, and that the plague was causing ‘infinite misery.’[1155]\r\nWeymouth and Melcombe, called upon to provide the same number as\r\nPlymouth, answered that their losses by embargo came to £6000, besides\r\nthe expense of supporting many poor women and children; Colchester had\r\nsuffered from the plague for ten months and possessed no 200-ton ship,\r\nand King’s Lynn had lost twenty-five ships to the Dunkirkers, while their\r\nport cost them £350 a year.[1156] Yarmouth, in two years, had lost by\r\nDunkirkers ‘and sundry other casualties at sea’ £25,000; their port cost\r\nthem £600 a year, their haven and piers £1000 a year, and there was a\r\nmunicipal debt of £2200 on which they paid £140 per annum interest.[1157]\r\n\r\nAgainst these sorrows we must set the fact that the returns show that\r\nthese ruined ports were able to steadily build and increase, year by\r\nyear, the number of their large ships, and in at least one instance—that\r\nof Dartmouth—while the townspeople said that they possessed no 200-ton\r\nvessel, the papers of 1626-7 show that they had one of 270 and two\r\nof 200 tons.[1158] The losses by wreck seem at one time to have been\r\nexceptionally heavy; between 1625 and 1628 393 ships, valued at some\r\nhundreds of thousands of pounds, perished at sea, the Eastland Company\r\nlosing £100,000 in eighteen months.[1159] But probably neither the\r\nmunicipal authorities nor the government held themselves compelled to\r\nstrict truthfulness in making out a case. As in most generations, owners\r\nappear to have overbuilt at the first sign of prosperous trade; in\r\n1633 the Trinity House petitioned for an enforcement of the navigation\r\nlaws, as shipping to the extent of 6000 tons was lying idle in the\r\nThames.[1160] When in employment, captains did not neglect any chance of\r\ntrade. In 1638 the master of a Mediterranean trader took a Turk, and sold\r\nfifteen men of its crew in a Spanish port; on his return he offered ‘the\r\nduty payable to his majesty,’ a tenth of the proceeds.[1161] The rule of\r\nrequiring the shipowner to give a bond, before his vessel went to sea,\r\nthat it should not be sold abroad had been strictly enforced since 1625;\r\nin fact before sale to a foreign subject could be effected the Lords of\r\nthe Admiralty, the Officers of the Navy, and the judge of the Admiralty\r\nCourt, had all to give their approval.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Payment of Hired Ships.]\r\n\r\nIt has been noticed that several of the towns put forward the crown\r\ndebts incurred on behalf of the military and naval forces as an excuse\r\nfor their want of means when asked for ships in 1627. Private owners who\r\nmay have been encouraged to build by the renewal of the bounty and the\r\ndemand for hired ships soon found that as regards payment they were as\r\nbadly off as the towns in their corporate capacity. They may not have\r\nexpected very prompt settlement, but, by August 1627, the owners of ships\r\ntaken up for the Cadiz voyage of 1625 were beginning to petition somewhat\r\nimpatiently. Ipswich, for instance, had sent twenty-four vessels and had\r\nnot yet received anything. In December these and other owners petitioned\r\nagain, mentioning that 100 ships had been lost during the year, and\r\ndeclining the offer of crown lands in liquidation of their demands.\r\nThey gave as the reason of their refusal the subdivision of ownership\r\nin a vessel among many members, and that they did not understand land,\r\nadding, ‘To be two years, and many of us three years, without pay\r\ndeserveth consideration, many of us undone and many more will be.’[1162]\r\nBy February 1628 it was noticed that ships were being purposely built\r\nwith less than the regulation space between decks, so that they should be\r\nunfit for the service of the crown;[1163] and later in the year masters\r\nof transports were asking double the ordinary rates, and were even then\r\nso unwilling to serve that threats of impressment had to be used. In\r\nMarch 1629 one unhappy man complains that he has had a vessel hired for\r\nfour years, that he has received in that time a bill[1164] for £200\r\nwhich has been for three years dishonoured, and that he goes about in\r\ndaily fear of arrest himself. It was not until the receipts from the\r\nship-money writs brought relief to the treasury that these debts were\r\npaid off. Under the government of Charles the hire of ships remained at\r\n2s a ton per month, but after 1642 the Parliament adopted a different\r\nsystem, that of paying £3, 15s 6d a month per man, the owner sending his\r\nvessel armed and completely provided for sea; but the state accepted\r\nresponsibility in the event of loss.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Inventions connected with Shipping.]\r\n\r\nThe demand for shipping naturally gave an impetus to the spirit of\r\ninvention in connection with maritime matters. In July 1625 Letters\r\nPatent were granted to Wm. Beale for a cement intended to preserve\r\nthe hulls of ships from barnacles, the first of a long series of such\r\ncontrivances.[1165] In 1626 some one, unnamed, proposed attempting to\r\npropel boats under water,[1166] and in 1630 David Ramseye, who may have\r\nbeen the David Ramsey of 1618, a similar inventor, designed ‘to make\r\nboats, ships, and barges go against wind and tide.’[1167] Again, in 1632,\r\nThos. Grent offered ‘an instrument’ for moving becalmed ships, which\r\nhe called the ‘Wind’s Majesty’; John Bulmer and Christopher van Berg\r\ninvented methods of raising sunken vessels and their cargoes, and in 1637\r\nand 1640 other patents were taken out for appliances to move vessels\r\nagainst wind and tide.[1168] In none of these cases was any specification\r\nenrolled. In 1630 Stephen Gibbs was granted the exclusive use, for\r\nfourteen years, of the means devised by him for clearing silted havens\r\nand draining marsh lands.[1169] Perhaps the most useful device was one\r\nwhich does not seem to have been patented. In July 1634 Edisbury wrote to\r\nNicholas, ‘There is now an invention found out to moor ships in the river\r\nwith iron chains.’[1170] If this was the beginning of the substitution\r\nof iron for cordage in the various conditions where one could replace\r\nthe other, it was the commencement of a change which vastly extended the\r\npossibilities of seamanship.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Piracy.]\r\n\r\nMore deadly foes to the merchant than the chances of war and storm\r\nwere the Turkish and Dunkirk pirates, who held command of the Channel,\r\nand for whom these were halcyon years until, in the next generation,\r\nthe Commonwealth navy swept the seas. For reasons already touched\r\nupon, neither the ships nor the men in the royal service were capable\r\nof dealing with these freebooters, and the appeals for protection,\r\nwhich began within a week of the King’s accession, continued until the\r\nstrengthened parliamentary naval force was able to secure the coasts.\r\n\r\nAt first the Turks—all Mediterranean pirates were inclusively described\r\nas Turks—were the most prominent enemy. In August 1625 they were reported\r\nto have twenty sail on the southern coast, and according to the Mayor of\r\nPoole, threatened that within two years they would not leave the King\r\nsufficient seamen to man his ships. As the Mayor of Plymouth said that\r\nduring that year they had captured 1000 sailors, and within the ten days\r\nbefore his letter, twenty-seven ships and 200 men, there was some force\r\nin the threat.[1171] A year later some of the Navy Commissioners, then at\r\nPlymouth, wrote to the Council that the successes of the Turks were ‘the\r\nshame of our nation. The pitiful lamentations that are made by wives and\r\nchildren ... is so grievous that we know if your lordships heard it as\r\nwe do, we are assured that it would move the same passion and grief in\r\nyour noble hearts as it does in us.’[1172] Their culminating success was\r\nthe seizure and sack of Baltimore, a thriving village port on the Munster\r\ncoast. There they landed on the night of 30th June 1631, and, besides\r\nmaterial spoil, bore off 237 English subjects, men, women and children\r\ninto slavery. There were not many vessels in commission that year, but\r\nthere was an inspection by the King at Chatham and Portsmouth, for which\r\nthe cost of preparation was £1275, an amount which expended in another\r\nway could have saved these victims.\r\n\r\nWhen any of the Turks were caught, fear of reprisals compelled the\r\ngovernment to treat them tenderly; some prisoners were tried in June,\r\nbut private instructions were given that they were not to be put to\r\ndeath,[1173] and shortly afterwards the relatives of 2000 men, captives\r\nin Sallee, petitioned for some redress, which explains the leniency of\r\nthe executive.[1174] Nor was this petition neglected, since, by a Council\r\norder of October, guns were to be exported to Barbary to ransom English\r\nprisoners. It was a poor way of upholding the honour of England, but\r\nsince the cruisers could not clear the Channel, and there was no fleet to\r\nspare for a Mediterranean expedition, it was the only one open.\r\n\r\nWhile the Turks operated in the south, the Dunkirkers, who, in addition\r\nto their other misdeeds, supplied the former with provisions and stores,\r\npractically blockaded the east coast. The Newcastle townspeople wrote\r\nthat they were destroying the coal trade, and at Ipswich trade had\r\naltogether ceased, fifty-eight ships being laid up for fear of them,\r\nand shipping to the value of £4000 having been taken in one year.[1175]\r\nIn August 1626, when the inhabitants of the coast of Suffolk were asked\r\nfor a ‘voluntary gift,’ they answered ‘with loud cries, that their\r\nvessels were fired or taken in their havens before their eyes.’ At Lynn\r\n1000 men, having 3000 women and children dependent upon them, were out\r\nof employment, and here the pirate crews landed and plundered and burnt\r\nhouses near the shore. The inhabitants of the Cinque Ports petition\r\nagainst the ‘force and fury’ of the Dunkirkers, and complain that they\r\nare ‘miserably oppressed by them and dare not go about our voyages to\r\nScarborough and Yarmouth, or fish in the North Sea.’[1176]\r\n\r\nThere were many English sailors among the privateer crews, and the local\r\nknowledge of these men was invaluable in enabling the ships to lie off\r\nthe mouths of the harbours or to chase close inshore. Duties of two and\r\nfive shillings a chaldron were levied, from February 1628, on all coal\r\nladen at Newcastle or Sunderland, destined respectively for English or\r\nforeign ports, to pay for a guard on the eastern coast, which was an\r\naudacious mode of taxing a particular industry for general protection,\r\nseeing that the tunnage and poundage was especially allotted to naval\r\npurposes. The money thus obtained was probably not applied to naval\r\npreparation at all, or, if it were it had small result, since, exactly a\r\nyear afterwards, the London fishmongers protested that nothing could pass\r\nbetween Yarmouth and the river, and that the city would soon be deprived\r\nof fish. Coincidently with this the Yarmouth people stated that they were\r\naccustomed to send 300 fishing boats to sea, but that the Dunkirkers\r\nwere so numerous that they could not go out.[1177] Even when the first\r\nship-money fleet was cruising in 1635, coasters and Dover packet boats\r\nwere stopped and pillaged while the royal fleet was riding in the Downs.\r\nAgain, in September 1636, while Northumberland’s vessels were mostly\r\nin the North Sea forcing the Dutch fishermen to take licences, the\r\nshipowners of the western ports petitioned that the Channel was so full\r\nof Turks that they dared not send anything to sea, that seamen refused to\r\nsail or fishermen to fish.[1178]\r\n\r\nThen in 1637 there is a sudden change. In July Nicholas was told,\r\n‘The coast has been free all this summer, and is from all Turks and\r\npirates,’[1179] the explanation being that, in March, Rainsborow had\r\nsailed on the too long deferred punitive expedition and was still before\r\nSallee. About this time a Protestant clergyman, who was four years a\r\ncaptive at Algiers, wrote, ‘During my abode there ... their armadoes\r\nkept an account of 1700 sail of Christian ships they had taken. The\r\nLord stir up the hearts of Christian princes to root out that nest\r\nof pirates.’[1180] One Christian prince had at last been moved to an\r\nelementary sense of duty, and the expedition of 1637, whereby 300 or\r\n400 Englishmen were rescued from hopeless slavery, was, in design and\r\nexecution, the solitary success of Charles’s naval administration.[1181]\r\nBut its effect was only temporary, and the last notice in 1640, before\r\nthe Parliament took matters in hand, is a letter from the Mayor of Exeter\r\nto the Council, stating that sixty sail of Turks were on the coast,\r\nand that they had landed near Penzance and carried off men, women, and\r\nchildren.[1182]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES I\r\n\r\n1625-1649\r\n\r\nPART III—THE ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Commissioners.]\r\n\r\nThe system, inaugurated in 1618, of governing the Navy by Commissioners,\r\nacting under the Lord Admiral, remained in force until February 1628,\r\nwhen the four Principal Officers resumed control under Buckingham.\r\nAlthough the Commissioners’ direction was of course, both in ability and\r\nhonesty, immeasurably superior to that of Mansell, they cannot be said\r\nto have risen to any great excellence of administration. In October 1627\r\nCharles, in writing to the Duke, apologised for the slowness with which\r\nsupplies were furnished, ‘the cause whereof is ... the slow proceedings\r\nof the Commissioners of the Navy (which all Commissions are liable\r\nto).’[1183] If King and minister were both of this opinion, it would\r\naccount for the supersession which so soon followed. After Buckingham’s\r\nmurder the post of Lord Admiral was put into commission, and the new\r\nLords of the Admiralty[1184] were even more reliant on the capacity of\r\nthe Principal Officers than had been their predecessors; but they appear\r\nto have been also suspicious and distrustful of them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Buckingham.]\r\n\r\nOf Buckingham it may be said that, had he possessed less power, he\r\nwould have made a better chief. In the ten years he held office[1185]\r\nhe practically doubled the effective of the Navy, for the Commissioners\r\ncould have done little without his aid. So far as the emptiness of the\r\ntreasury would allow he enlarged and repaired docks and storehouses, and,\r\nif he did not discover, he was one of the first to appreciate the true\r\nnaval importance of Portsmouth. He provided for the home manufacture of\r\ncordage by inducing Dutchmen to settle here and teach Englishmen their\r\nart; and he increased in number, and made permanent, the ropehouses\r\nattached to English dockyards. He reintroduced lieutenants and corporals\r\non board ship, and was the first administrator who began systematic naval\r\nand gunnery instruction in the service. It is difficult to apportion the\r\ncredit for the reforms which followed 1618 between the Commissioners and\r\nBuckingham. Nicholas[1186] gives it to Buckingham; but Nicholas was his\r\nprivate secretary, and we know that the Duke had no grasp of detail. On\r\nthe other hand he wrote in praise of Buckingham after the Duke’s death,\r\nwhen he had nothing more to hope from him, and it is certain that the\r\nCommissioners could not have stood for twenty-four hours against the\r\nvested interests they attacked without Buckingham’s consistent support.\r\nUnfortunately for his memory he must be judged, not as head of the\r\nNavy, but as the all-powerful minister, and in that sense history has\r\npronounced its verdict.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Principal Officers.]\r\n\r\nSince 1618 the duties of the Treasurer of the Navy had become, and\r\nremained in the future, almost entirely financial. His salary was\r\nincreased, from 1630, by the grant of the poundage of threepence on all\r\npayments made by him, including wages, instead of, as before, only on\r\nthose to merchants supplying stores; as well as a house at Deptford and\r\nother advantages, and in 1634 his fixed fee was raised from £270, 13s 4d\r\nto £645, 13s 4d.[1187] He even received the poundage on the salaries of\r\nthe other three Officers, and they were continually petitioning for an\r\nadvance in their rate of pay, which had remained unaltered since their\r\nposts were created by Henry VIII. It is suggestive to find that, among\r\ntheir reasons for the requested increase, they mention that before the\r\nreforms of 1618 they had an allowance of £60 a year from the Treasurer\r\nand Victualler for passing their accounts;[1188] and the Surveyor and\r\nComptroller estimated the total annual value of their perquisites before\r\nthat date at £384 and £430 respectively. This included the allowance\r\nfrom the Treasurer and Victualler, commissions given by officers on\r\nappointment, and dividends divided among them from the sale of old\r\nstores.[1189]\r\n\r\nIn 1637 they appear to have been promised that if they could obtain their\r\naugmentation without going to the royal coffers for it they were welcome\r\nto whatever they could get. Accordingly they point out that in this year\r\nthey had prevented fraudulent overcharge on the part of owners of hired\r\nmerchantmen to the extent of £1874, and they therefore desired to divide\r\nthe whole of this sum.[1190] What advantage this would be to the crown\r\nthey omitted to say. They were exceptionally unlucky, seeing that most\r\nofficials had only to petition in order to receive. In one case £20 a\r\nyear was taken off the salaries of the masters attendant, but, when these\r\ncomplained, they had each £40 a year added and with less work. Their ill\r\nfortune was, perhaps, due to the disfavour with which the Lords of the\r\nAdmiralty seem to have usually viewed them, and it was not until the\r\nera of the Long Parliament, when, from motives of fear, all wages were\r\nraised, that they shared in the general increase.\r\n\r\nNone of these Officers was of any historic interest. For two and a half\r\nyears, between 1627[1191] and 1629, Sir Sackville Crowe was Treasurer,\r\nbut he, to put as favourable a construction as possible on what happened,\r\ngot his accounts into confusion to the extent of £1500.[1192] Before and\r\nafter Crowe, Sir Wm. Russell was sole Treasurer[1193] till 1639,[1194]\r\nthen for two years with the younger Vane,[1195] and again in 1642 by\r\nhimself till August, after which Vane alone was reappointed. Russell\r\nwas a mere man of affairs, who confined himself to his accounts, and\r\nseems never to have ventured an opinion on anything outside them. Sir\r\nThos. Aylesbury was the first Surveyor of the Navy in 1628, and he,\r\nwhen he resigned, was succeeded by Kenrick Edisbury,[1196] perhaps the\r\nmost observant and energetic of the chief Officers, who held the post\r\ntill his death in 1638, when he was succeeded by Wm. Batten,[1197] who\r\nwas appointed ‘during pleasure,’ instead of by patent for life, as in\r\npreceding cases.[1198] Sir Guildford Slingsby had been Comptroller of\r\nthe Navy under Mansell, and was again given the same office in February\r\n1628 by Charles. The main incidents of his second tenure which have come\r\ndown to us relate to his assaults on his inferiors, and his quarrels with\r\nhis brother Officers. Immediately after his appointment, John Wells, the\r\nstorekeeper of the Navy, petitioned that, although the other officers had\r\nallotted him lodgings in the Navy Office, Slingsby, to accommodate his\r\nfamily and servants, ‘hath violently taken his lodgings from him.’[1199]\r\nIn 1629 his colleagues complained to the Lords Commissioners that he had\r\nfelled with a pocket pistol, and otherwise maltreated, the man in charge\r\nof the Navy Office, and kept him out of the house, notwithstanding their\r\nwish to reinstate him.[1200] Slingsby died in 1632, and Sir H. Palmer\r\nsucceeded him. The most notable event in Palmer’s official career was his\r\nexcuse for selling government cordage and pocketing the proceeds—‘because\r\nhis predecessors had done the like.’ He subsequently amended this defence\r\nby saying that he had spent the money on naval necessaries.[1201] Denis\r\nFleming and Thos. Barlow[1202] were successively Clerks of the Navy; and\r\nEdward Nicholas, who had been Buckingham’s secretary, became secretary to\r\nthe Commissioners of the Admiralty.\r\n\r\nTill 1628 William Burrell was in charge of all shipbuilding and repairs,\r\nand in 1629 Burrell and Phineas Pett were made assistants to the\r\nPrincipal Officers. Burrell died in 1630, and from January 1631 Pett\r\nbecame himself a Principal Officer, being three months junior to Sir\r\nKenelm Digby, who had been appointed in the previous October. Neither\r\nDigby nor Pett had any defined duties, and in Digby’s case the position\r\nseems to have been almost entirely honorary, although at one time he was\r\ntreating with Mervyn for the latter’s command in the Channel. Mervyn\r\nasked £5000, his arrears of pay, to his rights in which Digby would\r\npresumably succeed, and the £3000 he had given for his admiralship of\r\nthe narrow seas.[1203] It would be a matter of some interest to know to\r\nwhom that £3000 was paid, but there had been obviously no secrecy in the\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nAfter Buckingham’s death the Lords Commissioners met twice a week,\r\nsometimes at Wallingford House and sometimes in the Council Chamber at\r\nWhitehall. In March 1638 the child Duke of York was made Lord Admiral\r\nfor life,[1204] and Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland, his\r\nacting substitute during the King’s pleasure;[1205] the Navy therefore,\r\nceased to be governed by commission from that date. In 1628 the Principal\r\nOfficers met at St Martin’s Lane, but in March 1630 some rooms were taken\r\nfor them in a house in Mincing Lane at a rental of £30 a year.[1206]\r\nThenceforward expenses incurred in relation to that house appear in many\r\nof the accounts. It cost £150 for furnishing, twelve months’ beer there\r\n£13, 8s,[1207] yearly water rate £1, 6s 8d, but only 3s 6d for Christmas\r\ngratuities.\r\n\r\nAlthough in 1628 the four Officers had been reinstated in a portion\r\nof their former authority, they by no means escaped the control of,\r\nand occasionally severe censure from, the Lords of the Admiralty.\r\nSometimes my Lords considered that their sympathies ran rather with\r\ntheir subordinates than with the King’s interests, and, as most of them\r\nhad been suspended for acts similar to those they were called upon to\r\ncondemn in minor officials, the charge was not unfounded.[1208] In the\r\nfleet of 1637 embezzlement of stores by the boatswains had been very\r\ngeneral. There was nothing unusual in this, but the resolve of the\r\nLords Commissioners to punish the guilty persons appeared to strike the\r\nPrincipal Officers as both unusual and unfair. Their pleas on behalf of\r\nthese men provoked the Commissioners to write, ‘We observe that you are\r\nmore apt to intercede for those that are most faulty than to certify\r\nwhat you find against other boatswains ... it is time by due punishment\r\nto break up this custom of the boatswains’ exorbitant wasting of his\r\nmajesty’s stores, the continuance whereof so long with impunity hath,\r\nit seems, made the Officers think it almost lawful.’[1209] On another\r\noccasion they were told, ‘If you were as careful of his majesty’s service\r\nas you are to cast all such unfitting troubles on us, you would gain\r\nmuch more reputation and esteem to yourselves’;[1210] and, once again,\r\nreference was made to their ‘supine negligence.’ While they were exposed\r\nto these snubs from their superiors, one of their inferiors certainly,\r\nand others probably, expressed opinions of them with the same frankness.\r\nThey complained to the Lords that Francis Brooke, storekeeper at\r\nPortsmouth, ‘used many base words of ourselves, calling us loggerheads.’\r\nPerhaps the Admiralty agreed with him; at any rate it is not found that\r\nBrooke was reprimanded, so that the only consolation left to them was\r\ntheir salaries.\r\n\r\nObservers who acquitted the Principal Officers of intentional fraud\r\naccused them of incompetence. They were said not to know where their\r\nrespective duties began or ended, but the conditions under which they\r\nworked were not favourable to success in management. Each one kept his\r\nbooks at his own residence, and neither sufficient time nor assistance\r\nwas allowed for the various duties of inspection or bookkeeping which\r\nfell to him. Moreover they were compelled to purchase stores from persons\r\nholding patents for the sale of special articles such as iron, canvas,\r\netc., a necessity sufficient to account for any depth of badness in the\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Frauds and Thefts.]\r\n\r\nWhether the confusion was due to neglect or overwork, the effect on\r\nthe lower ranks of naval employés was the same. From the first year of\r\nthe reign we have a continuous record of carelessness and fraud, which\r\nneither Commissioners nor Lords Commissioners seem to have been able to\r\nstamp out. In 1625, on board the ships at sea, pursers charged on the\r\nfull number of men supposed to be mustered, and shared the profits made\r\non those absent with their captains, while gunners and boatswains each\r\nkept from two to five servants who were rated as seamen, but who were\r\nboys and landsmen, and whose wages were retained by the officers. When\r\nthe vessels were laid up the shipkeepers were usually drunk or absent.\r\nCaptain Joshua Downing one night rowed down the Medway, and ‘might have\r\ngone on board all ships but three and done any mischief,’ and ‘in these\r\ntwenty years last past all the navy hath not bred five able sailors nor\r\ntwo able gunners.’[1211] Of 330 shipkeepers, in 1634, only 42 were ‘the\r\nKing’s own men’; the rest were hired servants or apprentices, their pay\r\nbeing received by the ship, or dockyard, officers who hired them.[1212]\r\nIn 1638 matters were as bad. John Holland, then paymaster of the Navy,\r\nwrote that the shipkeepers and apprentice servants of the officers\r\nwere coachmen, tailors, gardeners, etc., and that the apprentices were\r\ndismissed at the end of their term as ignorant as when they joined.[1213]\r\nRobberies were frequent. ‘Generally the watchman is the thief and the\r\nshipkeeper the cabin-breaker;’ but the ship and dockyard officers dared\r\nnot prosecute, because such a course would have called attention to\r\ntheir own delinquencies.[1214] Downing’s experience did not evoke much\r\nattention, since, in the following year, it was reported from Chatham,\r\n‘There are divers that are upon the king’s majesty’s charges both for\r\nvictuals and wages, but give no attendance nor do no service; neither\r\ncan we take any muster of any man but just at dinner time, for no longer\r\nthan they are tied by the teeth are they to be kept on board,’[1215] this\r\nbeing in the full stress of war time.\r\n\r\nWhen captains were turning their men-of-war into cargo boats, to enable\r\nmerchants to defraud the customs,[1216] we need not be surprised that\r\ntheir inferior officers allowed themselves license in theft, and the\r\nreferences to carpenters, gunners, boatswains, and pursers, about the\r\nillicit sale of ships’ stores are innumerable. That fortunes were made\r\nfrom ‘chips’ taken out of the dock yards is well known. ‘The infinite\r\nabuse and prejudice the king has in all or most of his yards under\r\ncolour of chips is intolerable;‘[1217] again, ‘a great quantity of wood\r\nis carried away by workmen when they go to breakfast, at dinner time,\r\nand at night under colour of chips; they cut up good timber and call it\r\nchips;‘[1218] and in some yards the shipwrights built huts in which to\r\nstore their plunder. In one case a lighter containing 8000 tree-nails,\r\nsaid to be made from chips, but more probably stolen from Deptford\r\nyard, was seized, and the destined receiver was found to be one of the\r\ngovernment shipwrights who also owned a private shipbuilding yard.\r\nSome of the dockyard workmen converted the storehouses into lodgings\r\nfor themselves and their families, and this abuse continued until the\r\nparliamentary Navy Committee made a clean sweep of them.[1219]\r\n\r\nOf all the subordinate officials, the pursers, as in later times, were\r\nthe most acquisitive, having the greatest opportunities. Most places in\r\nthe Navy were for sale, but theirs were considered so profitable that\r\nthey were eagerly sought. In 1626 Nicholas was informed that a person,\r\nlately mayor of Rochester, would give him £100 for the appointment to\r\nthe _Anne Royal_, or £60 for either of two others. As the ex-mayor could\r\nonly sell again, the eventual holder must have anticipated a handsome\r\nincome. One article on which he would make it was the beer; the brewer\r\ndelivered this by beer measure, but the purser served it out by wine\r\nmeasure, pocketing the value of the difference.[1220] Sometimes he was\r\na pluralist. One man was cook of the _Bear_ and purser of the _George_,\r\nand executed both places by deputy. Of course pursers like the others,\r\nsold their stores ashore. But one of their particular sources of profit\r\nwas the men’s clothes. In 1623 wearing apparel was first ordered to be\r\nprovided for the men, and to be sold to them at cost price, subject to a\r\ncommission of one shilling in the pound for the purser. In 1628 it was\r\nbeing sold, when obtained, at £1, 7s a suit, to be deducted from the\r\nwages, but, as occurred with other naval requisites, the contractors\r\nfrequently refused to furnish supplies without prepayment. By 1636 the\r\ncommissions had increased. The merchant had to pay two shillings in\r\nthe pound for entering the clothes on board; the paymaster and purser\r\ntook each a further shilling on all articles sold, and of course the\r\nunfortunate sailor had to meet all these extra and illegal perquisites,\r\nthe result being that ‘the men had rather starve than buy them.’ The\r\noriginal purpose of the supply was ‘to avoyde nastie beastlyness by\r\ncontynuall wearinge of one suite of clothes, and therebie boddilie\r\ndiseases and unwholesome ill smells in every ship.’ The whole of the\r\nclothes served out during the earlier years of the reign was not a\r\nquantity likely to have much improved the unpleasantly suggestive\r\nconditions of this passage.\r\n\r\nIn 1641 Northumberland, as Lord Admiral, took the business in hand, and\r\nissued stringent regulations which forbade the sailor to purchase more\r\nthan fifty shillings’ worth of clothing a year, at fixed prices, and\r\nreduced the commission to sixpence in the pound, which was to be paid to\r\nthe purser by the vendor.[1221] When, as rarely happened, a purser was\r\nhonest, he seems to have been assaulted and persecuted by his captain,\r\nand his position on board rendered unbearable. Perhaps the key to the\r\nsituation is to be found in their petition of 1639, when many of the\r\npursers asked for increased pay, saying, ‘We know not how to subsist in\r\nour places without the continuance of what has ever been tolerated, or\r\nelse the grant of a competent salary.’[1222] Corroborating this plea we\r\nhave Holland’s opinion that wages were too low, ‘most of them being for\r\nwant thereof necessitated ... either to live knaves or die beggars, and\r\nsometimes both.’ It was however a sign of the times that when in 1640,\r\nThomas Smith, Northumberland’s secretary, took £40 for an appointment,\r\nhe found himself exposed to the taunts of his equals and had to defend\r\nhimself by asserting that he never bargained, but ‘what men voluntarily\r\ngive me my conscience assures me that I may take as mere gratuities.’\r\nIt was still no crime but was reaching the stage which precedes legal\r\ncondemnation. There is no trace of the sale of places during the\r\nCommonwealth, but the custom was reintroduced with the other fashions of\r\nthe Restoration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Captains.]\r\n\r\nNeither in their sense of honour nor in the extent of their professional\r\nknowledge did the Navy captains of this generation favourably impress\r\ntheir superiors. In August 1630 Mervyn, who was commanding in the\r\nChannel, wrote to Nicholas that he had captains who knew neither how to\r\ncommand nor how to obey; and a month later he requested that John Mennes\r\nshould be given a ship, so that he might at least have one captain who\r\nhad ‘passed his a b c.’ Men of such calibre usually owed their position\r\nto, and obtained other advantages from, court influence and family\r\nconnections. Of one man who received £3000 as his 3 per cent. commission\r\non carrying treasure to Dunkirk we read, ‘You may see what a brother\r\nor friend in the bedchamber doth.’ Another captain, his men said, was\r\n‘fearful in oaths,’ plundered merchantmen, and threatened to kill any\r\none who complained of him; his crew refused to sail, because ‘for his\r\nblasphemous swearing they feared the ship would sink under them.’ Others\r\nwere questioned for beating officers and men, but in no case does any\r\npunishment appear to have followed. Another form of fraud which came into\r\nexistence now, and lasted till the present century, was the forging and\r\nuttering of seamen’s tickets. The tickets were practically promises to\r\npay wages due, and in the state of the royal treasury were only saleable\r\nat a heavy discount. Not only did the captains and pursers forge tickets\r\nin the names of men who had never existed, but civilians carried on a\r\nbrisk trade in such articles, and, when Crowe was Navy Treasurer, they\r\nwere ‘such good merchandise that a penniless wag made out a ticket for\r\nBall, a dog ... and sold it with a letter of attorney to a man who lodged\r\nseamen.’[1223]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Changes during the Civil War.]\r\n\r\nWhen the civil war commenced most of the non-combatant servants of the\r\nAdmiralty remained, like the officers and men, in the service of the\r\nParliament, which took control by means of committees, whose members\r\nwere constantly being changed. Subordinate to the Parliamentary Navy\r\nCommittee was a board called the Commissioners of Navy and Customs, whose\r\nwork was chiefly financial; and the functions of the Principal Officers,\r\nexcept the Treasurer’s, were performed by another body known as the\r\nCommissioners of the Navy. The Earl of Warwick was the parliamentary\r\nLord Admiral, appointed in July 1642, in place of Northumberland; he\r\nresigned in April 1645, to be again appointed on 29th May 1648, when the\r\nnews of the Rainsborow outbreak was received. The Navy Commissioners,\r\nduring the earlier years of the war, were captains R. Cranley, John\r\nNorris, Roger Tweedy, Wm. Batten, and Phineas Pett. Batten is still\r\nstyled Surveyor, but the old division of work was broken up, and the\r\nofficial papers do not show that a Commissioner was continuously confined\r\nto particular duties. In 1645 Batten was sent on active service, and, in\r\n1646, Thomas Smith, probably Northumberland’s ex-secretary, and Peter\r\nPett, were added to the other Commissioners. The two Petts were the\r\nPhineas Pett who built the _Sovereign of the Seas_ and Peter Pett his\r\nnephew.\r\n\r\nIn one matter the Parliament found itself better off than the previous\r\nadministration, for the question of timber had for years been a\r\ndifficulty, the royal forests having deteriorated from various causes.\r\nNow, in spite of increased requirements, it was obtained more easily by\r\nthe process of seizing the timber on delinquents’ estates. In 1632 a\r\nreport was made on the condition of the forests, when that of Dean was\r\nsaid to be ‘wasted and ruined,’ the New Forest was ‘so decayed’ that\r\nthere were not 2000 serviceable trees in it; there were not more in\r\nWaltham Forest and hardly 400 in East Bere.[1224] Much of this wreck was\r\ndue to lavish grants made by James and Charles to private individuals; a\r\nfurther cause was the open theft which went on, sufficient wood to build\r\nships being sometimes taken away without any attempt at concealment.\r\nStill, in 1633, there were 166,000 trees left in the Forest of Dean of an\r\naverage value of twenty shillings a tree.[1225]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ordnance Powder and Shot.]\r\n\r\nJohn Browne, who held the appointment of ‘King’s gunfounder’ under James\r\nI, continued in that office during the whole of this reign. The price\r\nof ordnance in 1625 was from £13 to £14 a ton, and did not afterwards\r\nmaterially vary. Many complaints were made about the excessive solidity\r\nand weight of naval guns, which caused much of the straining and rolling\r\nat sea, and they were so unnecessarily strong that when sold abroad the\r\nnew owners rebored them for larger shot. In 1626 Browne was granted a\r\nreward of £200 for casting lighter guns which had withstood a double\r\nproof; but, notwithstanding this encouragement, he, like every one else\r\ndealing with the crown, suffered in his purse. By June 1628 upwards of\r\n£11,000 was due to him; and Evelyn, the powder contractor, had £2400\r\nowing to him, and had refused to furnish anything more for three months\r\npast. Coke thereupon suggested to Buckingham that Evelyn should be\r\ncompelled to resume his supplies, ‘but till the ceasing of Parliament\r\nholds it best not to urge him too much,’ which throws an interesting side\r\nlight on general history.[1226] Notwithstanding these straits, and the\r\nrequirements of his fleets, Charles did not neglect his glorious heritage\r\nin the crown jewels which were pawned to the Dutch, and Burlamacchi was\r\ndirected to sell 4000 tons of ordnance abroad and redeem the treasures.\r\nAs an appropriate part of the transaction Browne found himself obliged to\r\nexport in Dutch vessels, as they were provided with convoy.\r\n\r\nIn 1632 there were in store 81 brass and 147 iron pieces, presumably the\r\nreserve behind those in the ships and forts, and 207,000 round and 3000\r\ncross-bar shot.[1227] Stone shot are no longer mentioned. The allowance\r\nfor a second-rate was three lasts of powder, six cwt. of match, 970\r\nround, 100 cross-bar, 70 double cross-bar shot, and 2000 rounds for small\r\narms.[1228] The musket trade had been gained from us by Holland since\r\nthe preceding reign, and now Sweden was underselling English founders\r\nof big guns; in 1634 Browne, in petitioning the King for payment, said\r\nthat he had paid £1200 for a license to export ordnance, but that the\r\nSwedes were now selling at half-price. This Swedish manufacture was\r\nreally worked by Dutch capitalists, and within twenty years the price of\r\nEnglish ordnance in the Low Countries had fallen from £36 to £14 a ton.\r\nFor the proper equipment of the fleet, exclusive of castles and forts, 96\r\nlasts of powder were required in 1635, but in that year only 94 were in\r\nstore for all purposes; between 1628 and 1635 there had been no powder in\r\nSouthsea Castle, and doubtless many less important positions were equally\r\nill-furnished. Perhaps the crown could not supply the forts, because too\r\nbusy in private trade, the sale of gunpowder to merchants and others\r\nbeing a royal monopoly. A handsome profit was made on it, the cost being\r\n7½d per lb. and the selling price 1s 6d. In 1637 the year’s gains on this\r\narticle came to £14,786.[1229]\r\n\r\nThe Ordnance Office still retained that evil pre-eminence in sloth and\r\nincapacity it had already earned and has never since lost, and its\r\nsituation in 1638 was that of\r\n\r\n    the surveyor sick, the clerk restrained of his liberty, one of\r\n    his clerks absent, the clerk of the deliveries out of town and\r\n    his clerk absent, the master gunner dead, the yeoman of the\r\n    ordnance never present, nor any of the gunners attendant, and\r\n    the stores for ordnance empty.[1230]\r\n\r\nOutcries, such as we have been also used to hear in this generation,\r\nagainst their delays in serving the ships with guns and ammunition,\r\nwere loud and continuous, and, in 1639, it was proposed to return to the\r\noriginal arrangement made by Henry VIII, and allow the naval authorities\r\nto supply themselves with these necessaries. It is an illustration of\r\nthe meditative and weighty caution with which official wisdom can be\r\ntrusted to move onward from change to change that it was not until a few\r\nyears ago that the alteration suggested in 1639 was made. Finally we read\r\nthat ‘the accountant nor other officers keep no books, and the ancient\r\nofficers and clerks are adverse to all new propositions which meet their\r\ninveterate frauds and defects.’[1231] The parliamentary leaders seem\r\nat first to have doubted how far Browne was to be trusted, since on\r\n30th Dec. 1645 it was ordered that his works, which had been managed by\r\ndeputies, should be given back to him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Salutes.]\r\n\r\nBesides producing dangerous international friction, the matter of\r\nsaluting was a cover for theft and an excuse for waste at home. The Lord\r\nAdmiral seems to have been the only person whose reception was according\r\nto distinct forms, and for him the royal standard was to fly at the main,\r\nyards to be manned, and on his approach within musket shot of the ship\r\nthe trumpets were to cease, and ‘all who carry whistles are to whistle\r\nhis welcome three times, and in the intervals the crew to cheer.’[1232]\r\nButler notices the fondness of the English for making a noise as a mark\r\nof deference, and the expenditure of powder in this way was described\r\nas the ‘main excuse of gunners’ frauds,’ and as causing the waste of at\r\nleast a thousand barrels of powder a year. Every one stood closely on\r\nhis honour in the matter of salutes, and in 1631 Pennington was fired on\r\nfrom Pendennis Castle for not striking his flag. No occurrence was of\r\ntoo little consequence to be thus signalised. In one gunner’s accounts\r\nwe find: One faucon when the master’s wife went ashore.... One minion\r\nthe master commanded to be shot off to a ship his father was in.... We\r\nshot two faucons in healths and three when Master Newton went ashore.’\r\nOf another gunner it was remarked: ‘He cannot write, yet presents the\r\naccount here enclosed, in which you see the King’s powder spent in\r\nsalutations of ketches and oyster boats.... I shall shortly send far\r\ngreater and fouler examples of powder purloined by the last.’[1233]\r\n\r\nThe hired merchantmen in the royal pay had as much self-respect on\r\nthis question as men-of-war, and saluted towns on entering and leaving\r\nharbour, the captain’s brother, and ‘the captain’s friends for their\r\nfarewell’ in orthodox service fashion. The large ones had, in some\r\nrespects, the advantage of the smaller men-of-war, since the captain of\r\none of the latter, in accounting for his consumption of ammunition, said\r\nthat ordinary traders ‘scorned to strike to a whelp,’ and he had to force\r\nthem to their duty. The result of all this firing was that in the two\r\nand a half years, ending on 30th June 1627, out of 653 lasts of powder\r\nissued to the various forts, there had been 300 used in saluting.[1234]\r\nNor were these proceedings devoid of danger, since the repeated orders\r\nthat guns should be fired with blank charges were still disregarded, and\r\nthere are several instances mentioned of persons on shore being struck\r\nfrom vessels saluting at sea. The admirals were equally sensitive about\r\ntheir dignity, and when Lindsey commanded the fleet of 1635, the question\r\nof his flags appeared to weigh most on his mind. On 1st May he complained\r\nthat he had not enough flags and was not furnished with a standard; the\r\nnext day he repeats his wants, adding that he would like a kitchen ship,\r\nand a week afterwards he thinks himself ‘a little maimed,’ still lacking\r\nthe standard. In April 1647 the Navy Committee called attention to the\r\ngreat expense caused by the constant saluting, and ordered that it should\r\nentirely cease among men-of-war except at their first meeting with each\r\nother, or with an admiral. A merchantman’s salute might be answered in\r\nthe proportion of one for every three, or three for every five, shots\r\nfired by the trader. If these regulations were obeyed it was only\r\ntemporarily.\r\n\r\nAmong foreign powers the Dutch were the chief victims to the requirements\r\nof maritime decorum, here complicated by the dispute about the dominion\r\nof the narrow seas. In July 1626 the captain of Deal Castle fired at a\r\nDutchman which came into the roads with colours flying, and made the\r\nmaster pay ten shillings, the cost of the shot. In his report of the\r\naffair he says, ‘The rather did I it because I have heard it imputed\r\nthat we have lost the jurisdiction of the narrow seas.’ Six years later\r\na man-of-war having been sent to Calais to fetch the body of Sir Isaac\r\nWake, her captain had the audacity to force the French to strike their\r\ncolours to him.[1235]\r\n\r\nWhen Lindsey went to sea in 1635, his instructions ran that his\r\n‘principal care’ was to make foreign fleets perform their ‘duty and\r\nhomage,’ and if they refused, to make them answer for their ‘high\r\ncontempt.’[1236] Remembering the state of Lindsey’s fleet, not only in\r\nthe absence of the standard that he deplored so sadly, but in more urgent\r\nessentials, such as men, provisions and stores, it was perhaps fortunate\r\nthat Richelieu evaded the trial, and that the Dutch were content—for the\r\ntime—to salute all day long if Charles so pleased. Northumberland, the\r\nnext year, was told to insist on foreign ships yielding homage in Calais\r\nand other harbours, if out of range of the forts.[1237] Wiser than his\r\nmaster, if he did more than look into the French ports, he did nothing\r\nto provoke a collision. Moreover Northumberland may have felt that he\r\nwas hardly in a situation to enforce compliance. Lindsey mentioned in\r\nhis journal that, in two days, eleven ships lost masts and topmasts,\r\nwith only ‘strong winds’ blowing, but had not thought the circumstance\r\ndeserved comment, although his vice-admiral, the old Elizabethan seaman,\r\nSir William Monson, was not so reticent. Northumberland’s fleet was\r\nequally ill found, and on his return he charged the Principal Officers\r\nwith giving him ships leaky and out of repair, fitted with defective\r\nmasts and yards and bad cordage. Some, he said, were too old to be worth\r\nrepairing, and the new ones required girdling to make them fit for\r\nsea.[1238] What the Earl thought of his men and stores has been already\r\nrelated.\r\n\r\nHowever, English captains continued to carry matters with a high hand,\r\nand in 1637, Stradling meeting a Dutch squadron which did not salute\r\nwith sufficient promptness, reported: ‘The captain of the rear-admiral\r\nI have taken out of his ship and sent to Plymouth.’ As time wore on the\r\nDutch, seeing that Charles had enough to occupy his attention at home,\r\nbecame more independent, and in 1639 they were searching English ships\r\nand taking Spaniards out of them, a change from their former submissive\r\nattitude. Parliament, however, carried on the claim to the salute. In\r\n1647 a fleet of Swedes, 15 in number, passing down Channel refused to\r\nlower their topsails to Captain Owen in the _Henrietta Maria_. Owen kept\r\nup a running fight until Batten came up, and the Swedish fleet was taken\r\ninto Portsmouth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prize Money.]\r\n\r\nA precarious source of crown revenue was that obtained from the prize\r\ntenths. In the two years ending with May 1626, seventy-three vessels had\r\nbeen taken and proceeded against in the Admiralty Court, and Bristol paid\r\n£7604 between 1628 and 1631. It was not until the civil war that the\r\ncrew of a ship belonging to the state had any fixed proportion of the\r\nproceeds, but by a Council order of October 1626 ‘a competent reward’ was\r\nto be given to the captors. On the other side seventy-seven vessels, of\r\n100 tons and upwards, were taken by the enemy between 1625 and 1628, so\r\nthat the balance of profit was hardly with us. In another paper we are\r\ntold, the, presumably net, proceeds from Spanish prizes between July 1626\r\nand August 1639 came to £38,158, 8s.[1239]\r\n\r\nIn October 1642 the Parliament announced that henceforth one-third of the\r\nvalue of a prize was to be divided among officers and crew, in addition\r\nto wages. Its effect was undoubted since from February 1643 to April 1649\r\nprize goods were sold for £123,200, and this must represent an enormously\r\nhigher original value.[1240] But out of this sum officers and men only\r\ngot £14,465, while the two collectors, Thomas Smith and John Hall took\r\n£4989, Warwick £5985, and the expenses of storage, lading and unlading,\r\netc., were £17,000. The delay and deductions in the payment of the thirds\r\nwere among the chief causes of the trouble the Commonwealth experienced\r\nwith the seamen in its earlier years, and in this account we see quite\r\nextraneous charges borne upon it. The Treasurer of the Navy took £30,000\r\nfrom it, Augier, the parliamentary agent in Paris, £610, the secretary\r\nand usher of the committee of foreign affairs their salaries, and it had\r\nto meet various other items which would now go under the head of secret\r\nservice money. The Dutch system of rewards for captures was in working\r\norder long before ours, and was liberal enough in amount. Privateers were\r\nallowed, beyond the value of the ship and goods taken, a state reward of\r\nfrom 8000 to 30,000 guilders, the latter sum being given for any vessel\r\nof more than 100 lasts burden.[1241] If the enemy was sunk at sea instead\r\nof being brought into port, only half these sums were paid.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Naval Expenditure.]\r\n\r\nThe following table, compiled from the _Audit Office Declared Accounts_\r\nfor the several years, gives the ordinary and extraordinary expenditure\r\nin round figures, as well as that of ship money, of which £1,028,702 was\r\ndemanded by writ, and £716,528 was paid over to the Navy Treasurer.[1242]\r\nThe estimates for the ordinary and extraordinary are for routine, naval,\r\nand dockyard work and the Channel squadron, and do not include the cost\r\nof the expeditions of the first three years or of any of the later\r\nfleets. The amounts in the last column but one are those actually paid\r\nby Sir William Russell out of tunnage and poundage, anticipated revenue,\r\nand other sources. For instance, in 1625 he spent £170,000, of which he\r\nreceived £119,000 from the exchequer, £40,000 from tenths, fifteenths,\r\nand subsidies, and ‘from the French king’s agent’ towards fitting out of\r\n_Vanguard_ £4800.[1243] The last column gives the sums paid out of the\r\nship-money receipts for the corresponding fleets; no doubt much of the\r\nbalance went to clear off old debts, to pay for ship building, as in the\r\ncase of the _Sovereign_, and other purposes:—\r\n\r\n  +----------------+-------------+------------------------------------+\r\n  |                |Estimates for|                                    |\r\n  |                |ordinary and |   Dockyard expenditure, ordinary   |\r\n  |                |extraordinary|        and extraordinary           |\r\n  |                |navy and     +-------+--------+--------+----------+\r\n  |                |victualling  |Chatham|Woolwich|Deptford|Portsmouth|\r\n  +----------------+-------------+-------+--------+--------+----------+\r\n  |                |      £      |    £  |    £   |    £   |    £     |\r\n  |   1625         |    28,000   |       |        |        |          |\r\n  |   1626         |    28,700   |       |        |        |          |\r\n  |   1627[1244]   |    40,500   |  8445 |   1522 |  1714  |     370  |\r\n  |   1628         |    40,800   |  5860 |    704 |  3171  |     359  |\r\n  |   1629         |    47,000   |       |        |        |          |\r\n  |   1630         |    34,700   |  4977 |    185 |  2141  |    1460  |\r\n  |   1631         |    34,200   |       |        |        |          |\r\n  |   1632         |    27,900   |  6700 |     97 |  1025  |    1591  |\r\n  |   1633         |    28,600   |  7453 |    100 |  1233  |    1834  |\r\n  |   1634         |    31,300   |       |        |        |          |\r\n  |   1635         |    31,200   |       |        |        |          |\r\n  |   1636         |    15,500   |  5050 |    625 |  3029  |    3000  |\r\n  |   1637         |    14,200   |       |        |        |          |\r\n  |   1638         |    20,300   |       |        |        |          |\r\n  |   1639         |    38,100   |       |        |        |          |\r\n  |   1640         |    38,800   |       |        |        |          |\r\n  |   1641         |    38,500   |       |        |        |          |\r\n  |   1642         |    28,700   |       |        |        |          |\r\n  |13th May 1645 to|}            |       |        |        |          |\r\n  | 31st Dec. 1646 |}            |       |        |        |          |\r\n  |   1647         |             |       |        |        |          |\r\n  |1st Jan 1648 to |}            |22,000 |   3414 |   2247 |    5189  |\r\n  | 12th May 1649  |}            |       |        |        |          |\r\n  +----------------+-------------+------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n  +----------------+-------+---------+----------+\r\n  |                |       |         |          |\r\n  |                |       |Actually |Paid out  |\r\n  |                |Cordage|expended |of        |\r\n  |                |       |   by    |ship-money|\r\n  |                |       |Treasurer|          |\r\n  +----------------+-------+---------+----------+\r\n  |                |   £   |    £    |    £     |\r\n  |   1625         |       | 170,000 |          |\r\n  |   1626         |       | 117,000 |          |\r\n  |   1627[1244]   |       |  63,000 |          |\r\n  |   1628         |       | 110,000 |          |\r\n  |   1629         |       |  57,000 |          |\r\n  |   1630         |  4805 | 102,000 |          |\r\n  |   1631         |       |  46,000 |          |\r\n  |   1632         |  4455 |  21,000 |          |\r\n  |   1633         |  4145 |  69,000 |          |\r\n  |   1634         |       |  48,000 |          |\r\n  |   1635         |       |  85,000 |  88,000  |\r\n  |   1636         |  3265 |  58,000 | 136,000  |\r\n  |   1637         |       |  12,500 | 122,000  |\r\n  |   1638         |       |  22,000 | 109,000  |\r\n  |   1639         |       |  58,000 |  47,500  |\r\n  |   1640         |       |  78,000 |  44,500  |\r\n  |   1641         |       |  88,000 |          |\r\n  |   1642         |       |  66,000 |          |\r\n  |13th May 1645 to|}      | 392,000 |          |\r\n  | 31st Dec. 1646 |}      |         |          |\r\n  |   647          |       | 178,000 |          |\r\n  |1st Jan 1648 to |}      | 336,000 |          |\r\n  | 12th May 1649  |}      |         |          |\r\n  +----------------+-------+---------+----------+\r\n\r\nThe disbursements during the civil war years by no means represented the\r\nwhole of the naval expenses, there being always hundreds of thousands\r\nof pounds owing. The authorities, however, took care that the executive\r\nbranches should be comparatively punctually paid, owners of hired ships\r\nand purveyors of stores being the principal sufferers by delay. There\r\nis another paper[1245] which gives the amounts for the years wanting in\r\nthe official returns, and is perhaps more reliable than them in that it\r\nincludes the total expenses, both in money paid and liabilities incurred.\r\nIn view of the general belief that this country was vastly weaker in\r\nships than Holland at the outbreak of the first Dutch war of 1652, the\r\nstrength of the parliamentary fleets deserves especial notice:—\r\n\r\n  +--------------+-------+--------+-------------+------------+------------+\r\n  |              |Men-of-|Armed   |Cost of      |Cost of     |Total[1246] |\r\n  |              |war    |Merchant|Men-of-war   |Merchantmen |            |\r\n  |              |       |-men    |             |            |            |\r\n  +--------------+-------+--------+-------------+------------+------------+\r\n  |              |       |        |   £    s   d|  £    s  d |   £    s  d|\r\n  |1642          |  19   |   23   |122,988 16  3|74,342  8 0 |204,810 16 3|\r\n  |              | [1247]|        |             |            |            |\r\n  |              |       |        |             |            |            |\r\n  |1643, S.[1248]|  36   |   32   |133,760  3  0|74,881 11 6}|            |\r\n  |1643, W.[1249]|  20   |        |             |           }|332,869 15 3|\r\n  |              |       |        |             |            |            |\r\n  |1644, S.      |  36   |   23   |106,349 10  4|49,088 15 0}|246,970 16 4|\r\n  |1644, W.      |  18   |        |             |           }|            |\r\n  |              |       |        |             |            |            |\r\n  |1645, S.      |  34   |   25   | 93,161  3  9|43,947  4 6}|            |\r\n  |1645, W.      |  29   |        |             |           }|256,495  5 0|\r\n  |              |       |        |             |            |[1250]      |\r\n  |1646, S.      |  45   |   20   |138,194  6  4|42,931  8 0}|            |\r\n  |1646, W.      |  26   |        |             |           }|300,356 18 0|\r\n  |              |       |        |             |            |[1250]      |\r\n  |1647, S.      |  43   |   16   |124,395 12  0|44,743  8 0}|            |\r\n  |1647, W.      |  29   |        |             |           }|244,655  0 0|\r\n  |              |       |        |             |            |[1251]      |\r\n  +--------------+-------+--------+-------------+------------+------------+\r\n\r\nVane acted under an ‘ordinance of both houses of 8th August 1642,\r\nconcerning subsidy of tunnage and poundage,’ and simply continued the\r\nforms and system used by his predecessors.[1252]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dockyards:—Portsmouth.]\r\n\r\nAmong the dockyards the most noticeable change is the steady increase in\r\nthe use made of Portsmouth, while Woolwich was almost discarded, part of\r\nit being leased in 1633 to the East India Company at £100 a year.[1253]\r\nThe rent was to be expended in building a wall round the yard, and in\r\nthe repair of buildings.[1254] It had long been pointed out that it\r\nfrequently cost a fleet as much time and trouble to get round from the\r\nThames to Portsmouth as from that place to the Mediterranean, and under\r\nBuckingham’s administration it came into favour as a rendezvous for the\r\nships prepared for service. Very soon after the destruction of the old\r\ndock the advisability of replacing it, came under discussion, and in 1627\r\nthe Duke caused estimates to be prepared for the construction of a double\r\ndock, but his death deferred the question.[1255] In 1630 Pett, Sir Thos.\r\nAylesbury and others were sent down to report on its capabilities, and\r\nthey recommended that the men-of-war should ride in Fareham creek, at\r\nthe head of the harbour, about a mile and a half from Porchester, and\r\ntwo miles from the then dockyard, a proposal which was adopted. They did\r\nnot advise the making of a dry dock, thinking the rise and fall of the\r\ntide too little, and ‘there is no use of any there;‘[1256] but personal\r\ninterests were also in the way, the comfort and pecuniary advantages of\r\nthe shipwrights being bound up with the Thames and Medway yards.\r\n\r\nFrom this date, however, a few ships were always stationed at Portsmouth,\r\nbut it was not until January 1638 that a master shipwright was ordered\r\nto reside there permanently; before that time the shipwrights had taken\r\nthe duty in turns, and the absence of a dry dock, although several times\r\nintended to have been commenced, was still causing inconvenience and\r\nexpense. Russell complained that ‘his Majesty cannot have a pennyworth of\r\nwork there done under twopence, in respect the King’s yard and the ships\r\nbe so far asunder for transporting materials.’ The dockyard consisted\r\nchiefly of storehouses, and orders had been given that all private\r\nhouses near them were to be tiled instead of thatched, the former having\r\nbeen once already burnt down during the reign of Elizabeth.[1257] It is\r\ndifficult to say what extent of ground belonged to the crown at this\r\ntime. No additions are known to have been made to the land since the\r\npurchases of Henry VIII but between 1630 and 1640 various new buildings\r\nwere erected.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of hesitation in the adoption of Portsmouth as a permanent\r\nnaval station was the diverse opinions expressed as to the existence of\r\nthe _Teredo navalis_ in the harbour. This maritime pest, which begins\r\nto be especially noticed during Elizabeth’s reign, played havoc with\r\nships mostly unsheathed, and whose sheathing, when it did exist, was ill\r\nadapted to resist its ravages. In 1630 the chief shipwrights reported\r\nthat ‘no worm destructive to ships is bred in Portsmouth harbour;’ five\r\nyears later some of the same men turned round with, ‘We positively\r\nconclude that there is a worm in that harbour.’ The decision was still\r\npostponed till, in September 1645, a number of shipwrights were sent\r\ndown, and it thenceforward rapidly grew in naval importance, although the\r\ndry dock, so often ordered, was not commenced till 1656.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dockyards:—Chatham.]\r\n\r\nChatham was now the first of English dockyards, and in 1634 contained\r\nthe seventy or eighty acres, held on the lease of 1618, which was now\r\nlost. In March 1627 Coke, at the request of the King of Denmark, sent\r\na Dane named Andersen there with a letter of recommendation to the\r\nofficials, desiring them to explain to him their methods of work. The\r\nrequest was complimentary, but Andersen could hardly have been very\r\nfavourably impressed by all he saw and heard. The dockyard service\r\nwas as much disorganised as the rest of the administration; the\r\n_Assurance_ had recently been repaired only by the expedient of selling\r\nfifty-four guns to pay the expenses,[1258] and £7740 was owing to the\r\nshipwrights and shipkeepers there, nearly eighteen months’ wages being\r\nover-due.[1259] They had of course freely petitioned, but ‘a letter\r\nto persuade the workmen to go on cheerfully’ had quieted them for the\r\ntime. One explanation of their patience may be found in the existence\r\nof a rule under which persons in the naval departments could not be\r\nproceeded against legally until permission was given by the authorities.\r\nJust before Andersen’s visit work had been at a standstill for want of\r\nmaterials to the value of £400, which the government could not obtain on\r\ncredit, and in April the workmen still had fifteen months’ pay due. Both\r\nthe Commissioners and Principal Officers confessed their inability in\r\nface of these difficulties, since, if the men were discharged, they came\r\nclamouring and threatening daily for their wages, and if kept on there\r\nwere not sufficient stores for them to work with.[1260] Matters did not\r\nimprove, and in 1629 Edisbury pointed out that, in addition to all this,\r\ngreat waste and theft existed, many families living in the dockyards,\r\nand cabins and other parts of the ships being daily ransacked, and the\r\nmaterials stolen or used for fire wood, ‘every one almost being director\r\nof his own work for want of some able, understanding man to regulate the\r\ninferiors, as it was while the Commissioners had the government.’[1261]\r\nThis handsome testimonial to the merits of the Commissioners, lately\r\nrelieved, may be considered impartial, for the interests of Edisbury,\r\nthen paymaster, but shortly to be himself a Principal Officer, were bound\r\nup with those of the Officers.\r\n\r\nAnother writer tells us that the master shipwrights rated their\r\nsubordinates according to favour, and that they themselves were\r\nsometimes absent for one or two months at the time at their own private\r\nyards.[1262] In thirteen years’ experience he had never known any\r\ninferior suffer for delinquency, ‘although he had been convicted of\r\ndivers stealths.’ At the most they were suspended, and then restored, and\r\nthe entries in the State Papers bear out Holland’s assertions. He also\r\ntells us that Fridays, being the Rochester market days, were kept as a\r\ngeneral holiday in the dockyard; the expenditure on ornamental carving\r\nand painting had become four times as great as formerly, because the\r\namount was left to the master shipwrights who refused to be outdone by\r\neach other; if work was done by contract, a bill was usually sent in\r\nfor ‘overworkes’ which exceeded the original contract amount, and, as\r\nresult, the shipwrights’ houses were ‘fitter for knights than men of\r\ntheir quality,’ These houses had back doors opening into the dockyard—for\r\nobvious purposes, the writer hints.\r\n\r\nThe almost incredible financial straits of the treasury may be measured\r\nby the fact that some storehouses in Chatham yard having been damaged\r\nby a storm in January 1630 the money necessary for the repairs—only\r\n£20—had to be obtained by selling old cordage.[1263] Large sums, however,\r\nwere at various times expended on maintaining, improving, and enlarging\r\nthe yards. In 1629 there was spent £2197 on Portsmouth, Deptford, and\r\nChatham;[1264] and in 1634 there was a further estimate of £2445, for\r\nthe same places for additions subsequently carried out, one of them\r\nbeing a brick wall round part of the yard at Chatham. The barricade\r\nacross the Medway at Upnor, although it had been allowed to become almost\r\nuseless, was still nominally maintained. It must have been an expensive\r\ndefence, since the estimate in 1635 for another, made like the earlier\r\nones of masts, came to £2305, besides involving a yearly outlay of £624\r\nto keep it in good order. An iron chain weighing twenty-eight tons,\r\nand held by eleven anchors, was recommended in its place, as costing\r\nonly £1500.[1265] It is not known whether either plan was carried out.\r\nThe Long Parliament further enlarged the dockyards, and cared for the\r\nshipwrights spiritually as well as physically. In 1644 they ordered that\r\na lecture should be delivered at Deptford every Wednesday morning on\r\n‘saving truths,’ and the time thus occupied was not to be deducted from\r\nthe men’s pay.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stores.]\r\n\r\nIn 1637 the stores at Woolwich, Deptford, Chatham, Portsmouth, and on\r\nboard the ships in harbour comprised 1446 tons of cables and cordage,\r\n221 tons of anchors, 79 lasts of tar, sails made up to the value of\r\n£4500, canvas not made up to £5000, 167 compasses, 2236 hammocks, 520\r\nmasts, 1200 spars, 3694 loads of timber, and 332,000 tree-nails.[1266]\r\nThis was in the full flush of the ship-money receipts, yet both cordage\r\nand timber are far below the minimum considered necessary by either\r\nPrincipal Officers or Commissioners. As in later years ships lying up\r\nwere dismantled, and in 1631 the Lords of the Admiralty ordered that,\r\ninstead of sails and rigging being kept in a confused heap at Chatham, a\r\nroom, with the ship’s name painted on the door, should be provided for\r\nthe belongings of each vessel. In 1637 Hildebrand Pruson died, he and\r\nhis father having been sailmakers to the Navy for sixty years. Edisbury\r\nthen tried, but in vain, to persuade the Lords Commissioners to have\r\nthe sails made at Chatham and save a fifth of their cost. So far from\r\nundertaking fresh responsibilities they desired to transfer some of\r\nthose they already bore. They were at the time negotiating with Russell\r\nabout an offer he had made to provide the squadron for the narrow seas by\r\ncontract at £3 a man per month, that rate to cover all expenses except\r\nthose of repairs to the vessels.[1267] They were to be nine months out of\r\nthe twelve at sea, and doubtless Russell saw his way to a profit, but the\r\nproposal was not carried into effect. There were few naval improvements\r\nintroduced under Charles. Deck ring-bolts for the lashing of ordnance\r\nwere first supplied in 1628;[1268] staysails came into use early in the\r\nreign, one of the whelps having two in 1633, and in 1639 there were forty\r\nin store at Portsmouth, but they seem to have been only fitted to the\r\nsmaller classes of ships. In 1633 studding sails are included among the\r\nstores at Chatham.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Flags.]\r\n\r\nHowever badly off fleets might be in material necessaries, they should\r\nhave been well furnished with the æsthetic refreshment of flags,\r\njudging from the number in store. In 1626 £1280 was spent in providing\r\nthem, and in January 1627 there were 415 of various kinds to be had at\r\nChatham alone, and however low in the future might fall the reserves of\r\npowder every care was taken that the men should not lack this solace.\r\nA proclamation was issued on 5th May 1634 commanding that English and\r\nScotch merchantmen were no longer to fly the Union flag of St George’s\r\nand St Andrew’s crosses, but to each keep to its own national cross,\r\nmen-of-war alone flying the Union.[1269] The parliamentary committees\r\nwere just as fond of flags, for in the sixteen months ending with\r\nNovember 1646 they spent £1178 on these articles, while sailors’ hammocks\r\nfor the same period cost of £777. For 1647 their bill for flags was £567,\r\nand for hammocks £307. In February 1649 the parliament ordered that\r\nmen-of-war should carry a St George’s cross on a white ground, similar\r\nto the present admiral’s flag, which, although the St George’s cross\r\nhad been in general use for many centuries, may be considered to be the\r\nbeginning of the present naval ensign in its special form.[1270]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prices.]\r\n\r\nThe following prices were paid for naval necessaries at various dates:—\r\n\r\n  Cordage (1625), £26, 13s 4d a ton.\r\n     ” (1629), £32 a ton.\r\n     ” (1631), £30 ”\r\n     ” (1640), ”  ”\r\n  Tar (1631), £8, 10s a last.\r\n    ” (1635), £10, a last.\r\n  Rosin (1631), £13, a ton.\r\n  Train oil (1631), £20 a ton.\r\n  Crooked and straight timber (1631), £1, 10s a load.\r\n  Knee timber (1631), £2, 10s a load.\r\n  Elm    ”      ”     £1   6s    ”\r\n    ”    ”    (1640), £1, 12s    ”\r\n    ”  plank  (1626), £1, 18s    ”\r\n  Oak    ”       ”    £2,  2s    ”\r\n    ”    ”    (1640), £3, 11s    ”\r\n  French canvas (1635), £22 a bale.\r\n  Ipswich   ”   (1626), £1, 6s a bolt.\r\n     ”      ”   (1635), £1, 10s a bolt.\r\n  Powder (1627), £5 a barrel.\r\n     ”   (1646), £4, 10s a barrel.\r\n  Round shot (1627), £11 a ton.\r\n  Musket shot (1627), £14 a ton.\r\n  Hammocks (1625), 2s each.\r\n     ”     (1642), 2s 7d each.\r\n  Anchors (1626), £1, 10s to £2 per cwt.\r\n     ”    (1631), £2 per cwt.\r\n     ”    (1640), £1, 13s per cwt.\r\n  Beer (1635), 28s to 34s the tun.\r\n    ”  (1646), 38s the tun.\r\n  Beef in 4-lb. pieces (1635), 9d and 10d the piece.\r\n  Pork in 2-lb. pieces (1635), 5d and 6d the piece.\r\n  Codfish (1635), £4, 3s the cwt.\r\n  Biscuit    ”    13s and 14s the cwt.\r\n  Seamen’s clothes (1628):—[1271]\r\n    Shirts, 3s 4d each;\r\n    caps, 2s each;\r\n    cotton breeches, 2s 8d each;\r\n    stockings, 1s 4d a pair;\r\n    canvas suits, 6s each;\r\n    cotton waistcoats, 3s each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMMONWEALTH\r\n\r\n1649-1660\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Events of the Interregnum.]\r\n\r\nAmong the many social and political developments which characterised\r\nthe era of the Commonwealth the most interesting, to the naval student,\r\nis the sudden expansion of our maritime power and the extension of its\r\nfield of action. There was no previous experience to justify our rulers\r\nin supposing that the drain in men and money necessary to the support\r\nof a great navy—equal to that of the combined powers of Europe—could\r\nbe borne by a state already exhausted by civil war; and it may well be\r\nthat, although the sequence of events showed the maintenance of such a\r\nforce not to be beyond the national capacity, the strain on the national\r\nresources between 1649 and 1660 was a large factor in creating the\r\npopular discontent which welcomed the return of the Stewarts.\r\n\r\nUnder Charles I the pecuniary resources of the crown were unequal to the\r\nconstruction of ships during war time, while the launch of one, or at\r\nthe most two, a year in the time of peace was thought to be sufficient\r\ncause for legitimate pride and congratulation: under the Commonwealth\r\nthey were ordered by tens at the time, and in one year—1654—twenty-two\r\nnew men-of-war left the slips, besides the hired merchantmen in pay and\r\nthe numerous prizes fitted out for naval service. Under Charles the\r\npreparation of a single fleet for a peaceful summer cruise in the narrow\r\nseas necessitated a previous year of preparation, while the coasts were\r\nsupposed to be sufficiently protected by the occasional presence of a few\r\nsmall vessels: under the Commonwealth, besides a powerful reserve kept\r\nin the Downs ready for immediate action, besides the numerous cruisers\r\npatrolling the coasts, we find for the first time that Mediterranean\r\nstation which has played so great a part in English history occupied in\r\nforce, a moderately strong West Indian squadron, and the small beginning\r\nof the North American station. The rulers of the Commonwealth only did,\r\nso far as home waters were concerned, what Charles vaguely desired to\r\ndo with the Navy; but the wildest dreams of Charles never pictured the\r\npermanent Mediterranean and West Indian fleets.\r\n\r\nIt usually happens in statesmanship that administrative or executive\r\ndevelopment on any particular line is due rather to circumstances than\r\nintention, and the history of the republican Navy is an illustration\r\nof this rule. At the close of the civil war it was proposed to reduce\r\nthe naval establishments, and measures were being already taken to that\r\neffect when the Rainsborow mutiny occurred. The escape of Rupert from\r\nKinsale with the fleet, of which three of the revolted ships formed the\r\nnucleus, together with the encouragement his presence at sea gave to\r\nindividual privateering, necessitated an immediate and large increase in\r\nthe Navy, which then had to protect the trade routes as well as chase\r\nor blockade him. Rupert’s career made it obvious that the area of the\r\ncivil war had widened, and that henceforth it would be the duty of the\r\nNavy to deal with the enemies of the republic at the circumference of\r\nthe circle, its internal foes being helpless without aid from abroad.\r\nHow little those in power anticipated the changes a few years were to\r\neffect in our maritime strength, and how doubtfully they regarded the\r\nmeans available to contend even with Rupert, they themselves frankly tell\r\nus. In June 1649 they congratulated themselves that they had a fleet at\r\nsea such as they scarcely hoped for or their enemies expected, but ‘how\r\nthe Commonwealth will be able to continue the same in successive years\r\nis not easy to evidence.’[1272] But the episode of Rupert was followed\r\nby the more expensive Dutch and Spanish wars, both of which required\r\nthe existence of large fleets at sea and an ample reserve, and their\r\nsequel in the prolonged visits of Blake and his successor, Stokes, to the\r\nMediterranean, from which we may date the reappearance of England as a\r\nEuropean power.\r\n\r\nThe crucial difficulty of finance, which had wrecked the designs of\r\nCharles I, presented fewer obstacles to Parliament and the Protector.\r\nBy means of the monthly assessments, delinquents’ compositions, sale of\r\nlands, excise, and other methods, the sum of £95,000,000 is declared to\r\nhave been raised between 1642 and 1660.[1273] This gives an average of\r\nupwards of five and a quarter millions a year, against far less than a\r\nmillion a year raised by Charles, and, even allowing for the cost of\r\nthe army and the debts incurred during the civil war, enables us to\r\nunderstand the comparative ease with which the heavy naval expenses were\r\nmet at first by the government, and why outbreaks of discontent on the\r\npart of the men were few, and at once easily appeased by the payment of\r\nwages which had been allowed to become too long over-due. The financial\r\nsystem of the Commonwealth was reckless and improvident, inasmuch as it\r\nlargely consisted in living on capital by the alienation of private or\r\ncorporate property which, if confiscated, should have been held to the\r\nprofit of the state; but probably no system of taxation alone could have\r\nmet the demands of the army and Navy during those years. Not only the\r\nnaval but every other branch of the administration was overwhelmed with\r\ndebt in 1660.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Dutch War.]\r\n\r\nBy far the most important event of the interregnum was the Dutch War,\r\nsince our success in that struggle shaped the future course of English\r\ncommercial development and, in its results, caused English fleets to\r\nbe henceforward influential factors in continental politics. Although\r\nthe conditions were, in reality, not at all unequal, an attack made\r\non the richest and greatest maritime power in the world by a nearly\r\nbankrupt state which, with the exception of the passable success of\r\n1596, had failed in every important naval enterprise undertaken since\r\n1588, and which in that year had only succeeded—so far as the fruits of\r\nvictory were concerned—by the chance of wind and wave and the aid of\r\nthe very nation now assailed, must have seemed to many contemporaries\r\na more than hazardous venture. When success seemed to be definitely\r\ninclining towards this country, the _Weekly Intelligencer_ of 7th June\r\n1653 soberly remarked that ‘our generals ... were the first who have\r\nmade it known that the Dutch are to be overcome by sea.’ The relative\r\nposition of England and the United Provinces was very similar to that\r\nof England and France at present or recently—on the one hand a country\r\nwith a great commerce and a great navy, but a navy which, in the nature\r\nof things, could only bear a percentage relation to the vast pecuniary\r\ninterests it was required to protect and the extent of sea it was called\r\nupon to traverse; on the other a power which, with far less at stake\r\ncommercially, had for years been expending on its naval establishments a\r\nsum which must have equalled or exceeded the total value of its merchant\r\nmarine,[1274] whose fleets had been yearly increased, and whose seamen\r\nhad been freshly trained by ten years of warfare. How ruinous the war\r\nwas to Dutch commerce may be measured from the fact that between 27th\r\nJuly 1652 and 8th March 1653 Dutch prize goods were sold, probably much\r\nbelow the normal market values, for £208,655, 3s 11d.[1275] For Holland\r\nthen, as would be the case for England now, it was not sufficient to\r\nmerely hold her own, for anything short of absolute maritime supremacy is\r\nruin to a nation whose existence depends on an unlimited carrying trade\r\nand the unchecked export and import of material. The Dutch did not hold\r\ntheir own, but their flag was by no means driven off the seas, and the\r\nDutch navy certainly not incapable of further action, when the miseries\r\nundergone by a teeming population brought the republic to its knees in\r\n1654.\r\n\r\nMany circumstances and conditions coincided in weakening the position\r\nof the United Provinces. Their share in the thirty years’ war, being\r\nalmost entirely confined to land operations, had resulted in attention\r\nbeing devoted to the army at the expense of the navy, which had seen\r\nlittle real service since the conclusion of the truce with Spain in 1609.\r\nThe country was distressed by the economies rendered necessary by the\r\nheavy public debts, and was yet suffering from the results of a great\r\ncommercial crisis experienced in 1646-7.[1276] While in England faction\r\nwas, for the time, crushed, in Holland the attempts of the stadtholder\r\nWilliam II in 1650 and 1651 to seize supreme power had given rise to\r\npersonal and political animosities which had outlived their author,\r\nand which are said to have had a disastrous influence on the way some\r\nof the higher Dutch officers did their duty. But it was on the side of\r\nthe _personnel_ and administrative systems of the two countries that a\r\ncomparison is so favourable to England. The naval organisation of the\r\nDutch republic was directed by five distinct admiralty boards, each\r\nexercising separate control, preparing its own ships, appointing its\r\nown officers, and depending for co-ordinate action on the limited, and\r\nfrequently disputed, authority of the states-general. As might have been\r\nexpected, this system failed even to curb the Dunkirkers, from whom the\r\nDutch suffered nearly as much as did the English[1277].\r\n\r\nNever, on the other hand, so far as administration was concerned, had\r\nEngland been better prepared for war. Instead of officials who, as in\r\nthe preceding half-century, owed their posts to court influence, to\r\npurchase, or to seniority, the work was in the hands of men chosen for\r\nbusiness aptitude and who, in most instances, had given proof of higher\r\nqualifications on the field of battle or in parliamentary committees. Of\r\nthe latter class was the Admiralty Committee; but the Navy Commissioners,\r\nand especially those Commissioners in charge of the dockyards, on whom\r\nfell most of the duty of organisation, were officers who had been taught\r\nby actual warfare. Prompt, capable, honest, and energetic, sparing\r\nthemselves neither in purse nor person, and frequently bringing religious\r\nfervour as a spur to their daily service, they conveyed to war on another\r\nelement the same thoroughness and zeal which had made them victorious on\r\nland.\r\n\r\nVictory in the civil war had only been gained when a weak and hesitating\r\ncommercialism, scared at its own audacity, and longing for a settlement\r\nthat would secure its own liberties at whatever sacrifices of the hopes\r\nand consciences of others, had been steel-edged by Puritan vigour. The\r\nmen of that stern mental and moral creed were now in authority throughout\r\nthe kingdom and wielding its resources. Pitted against a nation of lower\r\nideals, sleekly prosperous, whose national genius had for years tended\r\nmore and more to take the one groove of trade, unwrought and unpurified\r\nby the searchings of soul that all thinking Englishmen must have gone\r\nthrough in those years, all the spiritual elements of success were on the\r\nside of England.\r\n\r\nNever, before or since, were the combatant branches of the Navy so well\r\nsupported. As a rule our seamen have had to beat the enemy afloat in\r\nspite of the Admiralty ashore, but here they had every assistance that\r\nforesight and earnestness could give. As a result of the political\r\ntroubles of 1650 and 1651 many of the oldest and most experienced of\r\nthe Dutch captains had been dismissed as adherents of the house of\r\nOrange, and their places filled by men of whose cowardice and incapacity\r\nbitter complaints were made by their admirals. The English captains were\r\nofficers practised by years of sea experience, or soldiers who brought\r\ntheir traditions of hard fighting to bear in a fresh field. The United\r\nProvinces had perhaps four times as many seamen as a reserve to draw\r\nupon; but, ill paid and ill fed,[1278] devoted to peaceful pursuits, and\r\nfrequently discontented with the mercantile oligarchy governing them, the\r\nmen, although once in action they fought well, did not give that almost\r\nenthusiastic service which characterised the Englishmen.\r\n\r\nThe news sheets of 1652-3 usually take the goodwill of the men for\r\ngranted, and this silence is itself significant; but occasionally actual\r\nreferences are made, and these references, even if inventions, may be\r\ntaken as indicative of the spirit with which the men were reputed to\r\nbe imbued. They had for the Dutch that hatred their fathers felt for\r\nSpaniards, and, for the first time for many years, they found themselves\r\nwell treated[1279]—comparatively punctually paid, properly clothed, well\r\nfed, cared for when sick or wounded, and promised advantages in the\r\nshape of prize money never previously allowed. What wonder they served\r\nthe Commonwealth, during its earlier years, as the crown had never been\r\nserved since the days of Elizabeth?\r\n\r\nIn number of ships England, even at the outbreak of the war, was not so\r\nill-matched as has been supposed. ‘You never had such a fleet as in the\r\nLong Parliament,’ said Haselrig on one occasion,[1280] and political\r\nnecessities had as yet prevented any decrease in the strength maintained\r\nup to 1648. During 1649-51 the magazines were kept well supplied and\r\nforty-one new ships were added to the Navy list, practically doubling its\r\neffective; besides these were the hired merchantmen in pay, or recently\r\ndischarged, and manned by trained crews accustomed to work together.\r\nAccording to some accounts the Dutch navy had been allowed to fall to so\r\nlow a number as fifty men-of-war, and, although merchantmen were taken\r\ninto the service, their crews, hurriedly got together and new to their\r\nsurroundings, were no match, so far as skill went, for their opponents.\r\nThroughout the war the Dutch, although they possessed many more ships,\r\nnever succeeded in sending to sea any materially larger fleets than ours.\r\nFifteen hundred prizes are said to have been taken from them during the\r\nwar, a number at least double the whole ocean-going merchant marine of\r\nEngland.[1281] If they possessed more vessels a far larger proportion\r\nof them were unfit for battle, and if ours were slower under sail they\r\nwere more solidly built and more heavily armed, advantages which told\r\nin days when tactics were elementary, and when, for the first time for\r\na century, English seamen tried to fight yardarm to yardarm.[1282] Yet\r\nanother circumstance was most fortunate for England; for a greater part\r\nof the year the prevailing winds gave us the weather-gage and the choice\r\nof attack. Dutch merchant fleets returning from the westward had to run\r\nthe gauntlet of the south coast, and some of the most desperate actions\r\nof the war were fought on account of—and hampered by—considerations for\r\nthe safety of these convoys. If they took the long and dangerous route\r\nround Scotland, they were still liable to capture when almost within\r\nsight of home. It will be seen, if these views are correct, that almost\r\nthe sole advantage held by the United Provinces was one of finance, and\r\nthat, although it might have caused political difficulties or revolt\r\nunder a monarchy, had no immediate influence in a country held down by a\r\nvictorious army.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prize Money.]\r\n\r\nCharles I fell, throughout his reign, into the error of supposing that,\r\nif ships and guns were provided, devotion to his person would ensure\r\nloyalty and spontaneous service on the part of the men. He found, in\r\n1642, that seamen are not sentimental, and that their sense of duty\r\ndrew them towards the best paymasters. That perception of their own\r\nbest interests, which had impelled the Long Parliament throughout the\r\ncivil war to treat the seamen liberally, had still stronger reasons for\r\nexistence in the years following 1648 when the maintenance, possibly\r\nof the republic, certainly of peace at home, depended on the action of\r\nthe fleet. Throughout the history of the Navy any improvement in the\r\nposition of the man-of-war’s man is found to bear a direct relation to\r\nthe momentary needs of the governing classes, and in 1649 the necessity\r\nof dealing with Rupert at once woke the tender conscience of the Council\r\nto some further improvements that might be made in his condition. Gibson,\r\nwho was all through the war, says that ‘from the year 1641 the bread\r\nand beer was of the best for fineness and goodness;’ but fresh orders\r\nwere issued by the Council of State to find out and prosecute any agents\r\nsupplying victuals of bad quality. Hitherto Lent had been strictly kept,\r\nbeing pecuniarily advantageous to the crown as well as spiritually\r\nprofitable to the men, although physically ‘of much discontent to them;’\r\nin future its observance was to cease, as was also the abatement of food\r\non Fridays, ‘being begotten by the covetous desires of the contractors\r\nfor victuals, though coloured with specious pretence of abstinence and\r\nreligion.’[1283]\r\n\r\nBesides raising their pay the Council also desired that ‘all just\r\nsatisfaction be given to seamen, and that they reap all the benefit of\r\nthe act passed for their encouragement in distribution of prize goods,’\r\nand expressed themselves as anxious to appoint persons acceptable to\r\nthe men as commissioners of prize goods.[1284] The act referred to,\r\npassed in February 1649, amplified and fixed authoritatively the merely\r\nparliamentary resolution of October 1642, which gave the men, beyond\r\ntheir wages, one-third of the value of a prize. Directed especially\r\nat Rupert’s squadron and Stewart privateers, the new act gave the\r\nofficers and men of a state’s or hired ship one-half the value of a\r\nman-of-war captured; the other half went to a fund for the relief of\r\nsick and wounded and the wives and children of those killed, while if\r\nthe enemy was destroyed they were to be paid at the rate of from £12 to\r\n£20 a gun, according to the size of the pieces it had on board. The net\r\nproceeds, after condemnation in the Admiralty Court and sale of goods,\r\nof a merchantman taken by a man-of-war were to be divided into three\r\nparts, of which one went to the officers and men, one to the fund for\r\nsick and wounded, and one to the state. If the merchantman were prize\r\nto a hired ship in the state’s service, two-thirds went, as before, to\r\nthe crew and the sick fund, but the remaining third was divided into two\r\nparts, of which one was taken by the owners of the ship, and the other\r\nby the state. The tenths which had formerly been a perquisite of the\r\nLord Admiral were now to be devoted to rewards and medals; and owners of\r\nEnglish ships recaptured from an enemy had to pay one-eighth of the value\r\nof vessel and cargo as salvage.\r\n\r\nDoubtless both Parliament and the executive intended to work this\r\nenactment loyally, but the needs of the treasury overcame their good\r\nintentions, and the delay in the distribution of prize money was a\r\nchronic source of discontent. Therefore from 1st January 1653 a new\r\nscheme came into operation, which gave ten shillings a ton for every ton\r\nthe prize, whether merchantman or man-of-war, measured, and £6, 13s 4d\r\nfor every gun she carried; for every man-of-war destroyed, £10 a gun; and\r\nthe Lord Admiral’s tenths were to be devoted to the sick and wounded and\r\nthe relief of widows and orphans.[1285] These distributions were to be\r\nmade by the collectors of prize goods three days after payment of wages,\r\na regulation which must have savoured of irony to those who were waiting,\r\nsometimes years, for wages. For the moment, however, the sailor was\r\nconsidered in every possible way, and, in May, Blake and his colleagues\r\nwere ordered always to exchange prisoners if possible, ‘as it will tend\r\nmuch to the satisfaction of the seamen when they see that care is had\r\nof them.’[1286] Matters progressed smoothly enough till the Dutch war\r\nstrained our finance desperately, and from 1648 till May 1653 there are\r\nbut two instances of insubordination to be found.[1287]\r\n\r\nWhen the Dutch war broke out the want of men was greater than the want of\r\nships, and it was decided to press all seamen between fifteen and fifty\r\nyears of age, a ticket being given to each man with his three halfpence\r\na mile conduct money, specifying his physical appearance, and which he\r\nwas called upon to present at the port where he joined his ship.[1288]\r\nAttempts were made to keep crews in the service by carrying forward\r\nthirty shillings of each man’s wages when he was paid off; but this,\r\nwrote the Navy Commissioners, caused ‘so much clamour and discontent that\r\nwe are scarce able to stay in the office.’[1289] Under James and Charles\r\nthe men had been glad to get any pay at all, and they probably strongly\r\nobjected to any proceeding which was by way of a return to old customs.\r\nEventually, however, the government did this and more, for a couple of\r\nyears later it was customary to keep three months’ pay in hand if the men\r\nwere turned over to another ship.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Articles of War.]\r\n\r\nA long step in advance towards the future discipline of the Navy was\r\nmade in 1652, when, on 25th December, the House of Commons enacted the\r\nfirst articles of war to which the service had ever been subjected, and\r\nwhich were grounded on some regulations for the government of Warwick’s\r\nfleet passed by the House in March 1648-9.[1290] These articles have\r\nescaped the notice of writers upon naval law, who begin their history\r\nof the subject with those passed in 1661; these latter, however, were\r\nonly based upon those previously existing, which are the groundwork of\r\nall subsequent modifications and additions experience has shown to be\r\nnecessary down to the present day. They were thirty-nine in number,\r\nand, so far as paper penalties were concerned, were rigorous enough. No\r\npunishment was adjudged for the infraction of the first article relating\r\nto the due performance of divine service; and the thirty-ninth is only a\r\nvague reference to offences not mentioned in the preceding articles, and\r\nwhich were punishable according to the ‘laws and customs of the sea.’\r\nOf the remaining thirty-seven thirteen carried the infliction of death\r\nunconditionally, and twelve that of death or lesser punishment, according\r\nto sentence of court-martial, or court of war, as it was then called.\r\n\r\nThe parliamentary bark seems to have been much more ferocious than\r\nits bite since, in all the numerous courts-martial mentioned in the\r\nState Papers and elsewhere, there is no instance to be found in which\r\nthe death sentence was carried out, and very few in which it was\r\npronounced. Moreover precautions were taken against the exercise of\r\ntyranny by inferior officers, inasmuch as the promulgation of the code\r\nwas accompanied by an order that the accused was only to be tried for\r\nserious offences in the presence of a flag officer, and that no finding\r\ninvolving life or limb was to be carried out without the approval of the\r\nGenerals or the senior officer in command; and as trifling charges were\r\nto be heard before the captain and seven officers of the ship in which\r\nthe offence was committed the offender had a fair chance of an impartial\r\ntrial. Very soon after the Restoration this regulation fell into abeyance\r\nand prisoners obtained justice—too often Jeddart—at the hands of the\r\ncaptain alone. Only one case of a really severe sentence on foremast men\r\nis to be found. In December 1653, in the middle of the war, six seamen of\r\nthe _Portland_ were found guilty of inciting to mutiny and were sentenced\r\nto death. This was commuted, so far as three were concerned, to thirty\r\nlashes apiece, and for the other three to stand one hour with their\r\nright hands nailed to the mainmast of the flagship with halters round\r\ntheir necks.[1291] There is no record of the infliction of such severe\r\npunishment by any other court-martial.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected in a mercantile community the thirty-fifth article,\r\nrelating to convoy duty, was the longest and most explicit. Under Henry\r\nVIII, and later, convoy money had been a legal charge; recently it had\r\nbecome difficult to obtain convoy protection at all, and when given\r\nowners and captains had been exposed to vexatious and illegal demands.\r\nNow, any man-of-war captains not performing such duty thoroughly and\r\nefficiently, and defending ‘the ships and goods in their convoy without\r\neither diverting to other parts and occasions, or refusing or neglecting\r\nto fight in their defence if they be set upon or assailed, or running\r\naway cowardly, and submitting those in their convoy to peril and hazard,’\r\nwere to make good to the owners any pecuniary loss so caused. As, in the\r\ncase of a valuable cargo and a penniless naval captain, such a sentence\r\nmight be equivalent to escaping scot-free, death was also added as a\r\npossible punishment. Any captain or officer demanding or receiving a\r\ngratuity was to be cashiered. From 19th October 1649 the House had\r\nresolved that convoy should henceforth be provided without charge,\r\nand in 1650 the east coast fishermen were gratefully acknowledging\r\nthe benefits resulting. Matters, however, did not progress altogether\r\nsmoothly. Sometimes merchantmen were independent, and when the government\r\nprovided men-of-war for the Mediterranean, would not ‘stay half a day’ to\r\nobtain their protection.[1292] But when the owners belonging to Poole,\r\nWeymouth, Dartmouth, and Plymouth united, nine months later, in begging\r\nfor a stronger guard than usual to Newfoundland the Council recommended\r\nthem to defer sending a fleet till next year, as a convoy could not\r\nbe spared.[1293] From other papers the truth seems to have been that,\r\nalthough a vessel or two could have been found for the work, the Council\r\ndesired to obtain for national purposes the men who would have manned the\r\nmerchantmen.\r\n\r\nThe option of sailing with or without convoy was not always left to the\r\ndiscretion of owners. In February 1653 the Council sent orders to some\r\nof the eastern ports that no vessel was to sail without protection, for\r\nwhich preparations were being made; but in July the owners of three ships\r\ndestined for the Mediterranean petitioned for leave to send them without\r\nthe escort, which had been twice promised during sixteen months of delay,\r\nand of which there was still no sign. Criticism must take into account\r\nthe fact that these things were happening during the strain of a great\r\nwar and that under ordinary circumstances, or when merely at war with\r\nSpain, there was no want of promptness in the action of the authorities.\r\nOn 25th February 1656 Hull petitions for a convoy, and on the 29th it is\r\nordered; Newcastle on 10th February 1657 obtains an order the same day.\r\nIn January 1660 twenty-five ships were on convoy duty, one being sent\r\ndown to St Helena to meet the returning East Indiamen (this had been for\r\nsome years customary), two to the Canaries, and four to the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wages.]\r\n\r\nThe articles of war seem in this generation to have troubled the\r\nsailors but little, since, in nearly every instance, we find officers\r\nthe prisoners before the court. A court-martial would not enable the\r\nTreasurer to pay wages and prize money too long over-due, or silence\r\nmen of whom one, who knew them well, said that they were ‘an unruly and\r\nuntamed generation,’ and that he found ‘no hope to satisfy them without\r\ntheir full pay.’[1294] But there are signs that, notwithstanding delays\r\nin payment, the men gave heartier obedience to the Commonwealth than they\r\nhad given to the crown under similar circumstances. On one occasion 180\r\nmen were sent down to join the _Fairfax_, but, not finding their raw\r\nshipmates already on board to their liking, announced that they would\r\nnot go to sea ‘to do those men and boys’ work for them.’ But instead\r\nof attempting to desert they betook themselves to other ships.[1295]\r\nThree months afterwards the Navy Commissioners received the welcome\r\nnews that the men were coming in ‘cheerfully and in great numbers since\r\nthe publication of the late encouragement to them,’[1296] and from some\r\nplaces they were coming up as volunteers. From Dover and Deal came the\r\ninformation that the new arrangements were ‘much liked,’ and that the\r\ngreater number of the men were willing to serve.[1297] Commissioner\r\nPeter Pett reported from Chatham that he found ‘the seamen in general\r\nto be very tractable and complying, and begin to attend to their duties\r\nhandsomely.’\r\n\r\nSo far as wages were concerned, the encouragement spoken of related to\r\nthe increased pay which took effect from 1st Jan. 1653. During the civil\r\nwar the rate had been 19s a month; in the fleets sent against Rupert\r\nit had been raised to 25s for that particular service, and it was now\r\nto be 24s for able seamen (‘fit for helm and lead, top and yard’), 19s\r\nfor ordinary, and 14s 3d for gromets,[1298] and 9s 6d for boys. Each\r\nman’s capacity was to be marked on his wages ticket when paid off, the\r\nfirst sign of the present discharge note. As a further inducement, by an\r\norder of 29th Jan. 1653, 20 men in first-, 16 in second-, 12 in third-,\r\n8 in fourth-, 6 in fifth-, and 4 in sixth-rates were to be rated as\r\nmidshipmen, with pay from £1, 10s to £2, 5s a month, according to the\r\nclass of ship, and from 14th Dec. 1655 no one was to be so rated unless\r\nable to undertake an officer’s duties, if necessary.[1299] Of course\r\nthe increase by the government caused a corresponding rise in merchant\r\nseamen’s wages; and at Ipswich, soon afterwards, the latter were so hard\r\nto come by as to be obtaining master’s pay.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Soldiers on board Ship.]\r\n\r\nIt was estimated, although the number proved to be insufficient, that\r\n16,000 men would be required in 1653, and many of these were untrained\r\nlandsmen and boys, almost useless at sea. The remaining thousands\r\nneeded were drawn from the ranks of the army. It has been suggested\r\nthat soldiers were sent on board to keep the sailors in subjection,\r\nbut, beyond the quite adequate explanation of a war demanding a larger\r\nnumber of men than the maritime population had ever before been called\r\nupon to supply, there is not the slightest trace of ill-feeling between\r\nsoldiers and sailors such as would have inevitably occurred had the\r\nlatter understood it as an attempt at intimidation. The expressed purpose\r\nwas ‘to perform as far as they are able, all service as seamen, and to\r\nbe ordered in like capacity as the rest;’ evidently they were expected\r\nto help in deck work and where no especial training was requisite.\r\nAltogether some 3000 or 4000 soldiers were sent on board the fleet; and\r\nit is significant of the different discipline, or the different spirit,\r\nanimating the army and the Navy, that, although the new comers suffered\r\nthe same vexations as the seamen in relation to postponed pay and prize\r\nmoney, in addition to the hardships peculiar to the sudden change in\r\nsituation and duties, they do not appear to have troubled the executive\r\nwith a single complaint beyond one meek remonstrance about the absence of\r\nhammocks.[1300]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Causes of Discontent.]\r\n\r\nThe seamen appear to have decided that their duties began and ended\r\non salt water. Captain Taylor, at Chatham, informed the Admiralty\r\nCommissioners that ships might be sent to sea in half the time and at\r\none-third of the cost if the men could only be persuaded to help in\r\ntheir preparation; but ‘not one will help to get out ballast, or take it\r\nin, or do almost anything tending towards dispatch.’ Instead of working\r\nthey haunted the beershops, which have always been the curse of their\r\nclass. Bourne, the Commissioner at Harwich, had ‘the beginning of an\r\nugly mutiny,’ attributable to drink; but Bourne eventually succeeded in\r\nputting down the alehouses at Harwich. At Plymouth vested interests were\r\ntoo strong for Hatsell, the agent there:—\r\n\r\n    The men come tippling ashore, and then march away in their mad\r\n    fits.... The abominable strong drink brewed in this town is of\r\n    more prejudice to the state and to the poor men than the heads\r\n    of all the brewers and alehouse keepers here are worth.... The\r\n    government here protest they cannot remedy it, as the brewers\r\n    have grown so rich they contend with them at law.... This\r\n    strong drink is from 26s to 28s a hogshead, and stronger than\r\n    sack, and when a sailor has drunk one bowl of it it makes him\r\n    half out of his wits.[1301]\r\n\r\nSuch a letter explains many of the so-called mutinies.\r\n\r\nThe system of payment, again, exposed the men to every temptation, since\r\na ship might be a year or two at sea and no wages were given or expected\r\nuntil she was ordered in for repairs or laid up, the result being that\r\nwhen money was extraordinarily scarce cruisers were kept unnecessarily\r\nin commission to postpone the settling day. Money was sometimes borrowed\r\nwhen a squadron returned to port, and of £32,000 obtained in this manner\r\nin 1657, £10,200 was still owing in 1659.[1302] There are numerous\r\nexpostulations from officers about their long over-due pay, but, read\r\nby themselves, these lamentations are sometimes apt to leave a wrong\r\nimpression. Edward Larkin, for instance, gunner of the _Mayflower_,\r\npetitions in 1655 for two and a half years of his ‘dearly earned wages,’\r\nof which he has only received six months; his wife and family are turned\r\nout of doors, his goods seized, and he himself arrested for debt. This,\r\ntaken alone, appears to be a pathetic indictment of the ways of the\r\nadministration, but here the corrective is supplied by another paper\r\nwhich is an account of stores embezzled by the said Edward Larkin.\r\n\r\nThere was more difficulty, so far as willingness was concerned, in\r\nmanning the fleets during the war with Spain than during the Dutch war.\r\nThe men feared tropical climates, and ‘are so afraid of being sent to\r\nthe West Indies that they say they would as soon be hanged.’ Moreover as\r\nthe years went by the Commonwealth did not pay more promptly. There is\r\nno sign, so far as their debates go, that Parliament, in improving the\r\nposition of the men, had ever been moved by other than purely selfish\r\nmotives, and it may have been felt that less now depended on the attitude\r\nof the Navy, or that there was less likelihood, under any provocation, of\r\na serious outbreak. Slight ones frequently occurred and were invariably\r\nattributed, by the officers on the spot, to the non-payment of wages\r\nor prize-money, and were as invariably appeased when these claims were\r\nsettled. Sometimes discontent was rather an excuse than a cause; when the\r\ncrew of the _Ruby_ refused to sail, alleging that they had no clothes\r\nand that the ship was defective, they were easily persuaded back to duty\r\nwhen withdrawn from the influence of their landladies, who ‘have been\r\nthe greatest instruments to hinder their going on board.’ In the matter\r\nof prize money officers of high rank fared little better in dealing with\r\nthe commissioners of prize goods. There are two letters on this subject\r\naddressed in August 1654 to the commissioners. The first is mild in\r\ntone; the second, signed by sixteen captains in the Downs, curtly points\r\nout that their prize money for the three last actions with the Dutch is\r\nstill due and that unless it is immediately paid they will appeal to the\r\nProtector.[1303] If captains were compelled to combine and threaten\r\nwe may imagine how the sailors raged vainly against official penury or\r\ninertia.[1304]\r\n\r\nPoverty occasionally caused the prize money gained by one section of the\r\nnaval force to be applied to the payment of wages due to another; in\r\nOctober 1655 Blake’s men were partly paid this way, and, vaguely, the\r\ndeficiency thus made ‘to be supplied some other way.’ There are hints\r\nthat the Admiralty Court itself was not above suspicion. Captain Kendal,\r\nof the _Success_, wrote, in April 1654, that sixteen months previously he\r\nhad taken a Dutch ship, still uncondemned; ‘but I suppose the bribes do\r\nappear very large in the Admiralty Court,’ and, ‘I fear there hath been\r\nmuch corruption in the Admiralty Court.’\r\n\r\nIt is but fair, however, to the prize commissioners to notice that the\r\ndifficulties of the position were not altogether due to themselves. In\r\n1654 they wrote to the Admiralty Court stating that they had sold ships\r\nand goods to the value of £70,000, but could not keep the proceeds,\r\nbecause compelled to meet the sums charged upon them by the Council of\r\nState, notwithstanding the decrees of the Court ordering them to hold\r\nthe money. Being uneasy about their position they desired security or\r\nindemnity.[1305] Another source of abuse was the custom by which crews\r\nwere allowed to plunder a prize, on or above the gun deck, of all\r\narticles except arms, ammunition, and ship’s stores. English merchantmen\r\nrecaptured from an enemy sometimes experienced more loss from the rescuer\r\nthan from the original captor. The owners of the _Sarah_, recaptured by\r\nthe _Falmouth_, found that while the enemy had done five pounds of damage\r\nthe Englishmen had helped themselves to the value of £500, and five or\r\nsix other ships were similarly treated.[1306]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Protests.]\r\n\r\nWhile the majority of the men made protest against their wrongs in the\r\nuseless and prejudicial form of riots, there seem to have been a thinking\r\nminority who were able to apply to their own situation the principles\r\nfor which they had fought, and which had sent Charles to the block and\r\nCromwell to Whitehall. These men drew up a petition to the Protector,\r\nwhich, before being forwarded, was considered, on 17th October 1654, by\r\na council of two admirals and twenty-three commanding officers, held on\r\nboard the _Swiftsure_ in the Downs, at which it was decided that it was\r\nlawful for them to petition and that the grievances stated were real,\r\nexcept the one relating to foreign service.[1307] It was a sign of the\r\ntimes that admirals and captains should have acknowledged such a right\r\nin the ‘common sailor,’ and that they did not think themselves warranted\r\nin striking out the portion of which they disapproved; they decided that\r\nit should be ‘so far owned by us’ as to be presented to the Generals.\r\nThe petition was as much a remonstrance as a prayer, and, after claiming\r\nthat they had done the country good service and borne with hardship,\r\nsickness, and bad food for its sake, went on to remind the Protector\r\nthat Parliament had declared its intention of enlarging the liberties of\r\nthe people, ‘which we were in great hopes of.’ Their hopes have scarcely\r\nyet, so far as regards seamen, been realised, but it is expressive of\r\nthe vast progress the events of a few years had caused in the political\r\neducation and self-respect of a class hitherto proverbially debased and\r\nunreflecting, that constitutional declarations and logical applications\r\nof the principles their rulers suited to themselves should have begun to\r\nreplace the hopeless, unhelpful turbulence of the last generation.\r\n\r\nThey seem to have objected to foreign service mainly because their\r\nfamilies were left without support for a longer period than usual, and\r\nbitterly complained that, in accordance with a Council order of 6th Dec.\r\n1652, they were not permitted to go on shore, nor visitors allowed to\r\ncome on board, when in the Downs, and presumably other places, keeping\r\nthem ‘under a degree of thraldom and bondage.’ This regulation was\r\nthen new to them, but it remained in existence long enough to be one\r\nof the injustices the mutineers of 1797 desired to have redressed. The\r\nconclusion arrived at was a prayer that\r\n\r\n    they may be relieved in those grievances and may reap some\r\n    fruits of all their bloodshed and hardships, and that they\r\n    may not be imprested to serve, they humbly apprehending it to\r\n    be inconsistent with the principles of Freedom and Liberty to\r\n    force men to serve in military employments, either by sea or\r\n    land; and that your petitioners may be as free as the Dutch\r\n    seamen, against whom they have been such instruments in the\r\n    Lord’s hands for the good of their country; but that if the\r\n    Commonwealth have occasion to employ any of your petitioners\r\n    they may be hired as the Dutch are, and that they, or their\r\n    lawful attorney, may be paid every six months at the furthest,\r\n    and that such other encouragement to their relations may be\r\n    assured in case they are slain in the service as shall be\r\n    agreeable to justice, etc., as their necessity calls for, and\r\n    that all other liberties and privileges due to your petitioners\r\n    as freemen of England may be granted and secured.\r\n\r\nThe Council of State must have felt that the world was indeed moving\r\nwhen English seamen called themselves freemen, demanded the rights of\r\nfreemen, and no longer admitted prescription as sufficient reason for the\r\ncontinuance of their wrongs. The fact that there is no reference, printed\r\nor manuscript, to this petition does not, of course, prove that it was\r\nnot considered and replied to, but it is certain that if any promises\r\nwere made not the slightest practical result followed them. There is a\r\npaper assigned to this date which may have had an indirect connection\r\nwith the affair.[1308] It is a report from the Admiralty to the Protector\r\nand Council dilating on the state of the naval administration and the\r\ndifficulties with which they had to deal. Every sentence of their long\r\nnarrative has reference to the want of money, and may be abstracted into\r\nthe one particular that while £8000 a week was allowed to the Admiralty\r\nthe victualling and stores absorbed more than this amount, leaving\r\nnothing for wages and other expenses.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these embarrassments favourite captains and handy\r\nships seem to have had no difficulty in obtaining crews. Referring\r\nto the _Speaker_ and the _Hind_, an official writes: ‘Men have been\r\non board seven or eight days in hopes of being entered, which I have\r\nrefused to do, having had very much trouble to reduce them to their\r\ncomplement.’[1309] The _Sapphire_, when commanded by Heaton, was another\r\nvessel in which men were eager to serve, and to such purpose that out of\r\n84 prizes brought into Plymouth between August 1652 and December 1655\r\ntwenty were taken by her.[1310]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Confusion after Cromwell’s Death.]\r\n\r\nThe death of Cromwell, and the intrigues which followed that event,\r\nintensified the disorder existing in naval affairs, but even before\r\nSeptember 1658 the strong hand which had kept some sort of order seems\r\nto have been losing its grip. In July the Commissioners of the Admiralty\r\ntold the Council that ‘the credit of your Navy is so greatly impaired\r\nthat, having occasion to buy some necessary provisions, as tallow and\r\nthe like, your ministers can obtain none but for ready money,’ and they\r\ncomplained that out of the customs and excise, nominally set apart for\r\nthe Navy, half was diverted to the army, £2000 a week to the Protector,\r\nand judges’ and other salaries taken from it.[1311] The navy debt on 1st\r\nJuly was returned at £573,474, and of this £286,000 was due for wages,\r\nso that we can understand why some crews had been for two and three\r\nyears unpaid. Yet the succession of Richard Cromwell was well received\r\nby the fleet in the Downs, and the officers and crews of vessels on\r\noutlying stations, such as the _Paradox_ at Milford and _Assurance_ at\r\nScarborough, hastened to announce their satisfaction. When Montagu wrote\r\nto Stokes, commanding in the Mediterranean, for signatures to an address\r\npromising fidelity to Richard, only one officer of that squadron, Captain\r\nSaunders, of the _Torrington_, manifested any hesitation about signing\r\nit.[1312]\r\n\r\nIn their address to the new Protector the officers of the fleet, in\r\nexpressing their affection for the memory of Oliver, speak of ‘the\r\nindulgence he showed to us who served him in his fleet’; but, unless\r\nthey were alluding to the higher scale of pay and the arrangements, to\r\nbe presently noticed, made for the care of the sick and wounded, one or\r\nboth of which may or may not have been owing to his initiative, it is\r\ndifficult to divine what indulgences they had to be especially grateful\r\nto him for.[1313] By June 1659 there was owing for wages £371,930,[1314]\r\nand it may be imagined that if the men, whom it was important to\r\nconciliate, remained unpaid, merchants supplying stores, victualling\r\nagents, and dockyard workmen fared still worse. In September the crew\r\nof the _Marmaduke_ solicited some redress; they said they were abused\r\nby their officers, cheated of their victuals and pinch-gut money,[1315]\r\nand had to go begging about the streets, ‘scoffed and jeered at by other\r\nnations.’ On 1st February 1660 the wages debt was £354,000, some ships\r\nhaving been four years unpaid,[1316] and these figures, the correlatives\r\nof which existed in every other branch of the administration, form the\r\nbest explanation of the equanimity with which the Restoration was viewed\r\nby the seamen and others who may have seen in the return of Charles II\r\ntheir only chance of payment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Care for the Sick and Wounded.]\r\n\r\nUnder the Commonwealth occurs the earliest attempt to afford the men some\r\nof that attention to which, when ill or wounded, they were entitled. The\r\narrangements made in 1649 and 1652, although sufficient for ordinary\r\nneeds, were inadequate to the necessities of the Dutch war; and the\r\nState was compelled to supplement the existing resources for the relief\r\nof disabled men, and to provide additional aid for widows and orphans.\r\nAfter the action of 28th and 29th September 1652 the Council ordered the\r\nlord mayor to provide space for the wounded in the London hospitals,\r\nand on 18th October £500 was assigned to the mayor of Dover to meet the\r\nexpense of the injured landed there. On 15th December the Admiralty\r\nCommittee passed a formal resolution that every care was to be taken\r\nof the sick and wounded, both at sea and on shore, and that the London\r\nhospitals were to receive some, and the most suitable port towns the\r\nothers. Every ship was to be allowed medical comforts—rice, oatmeal, and\r\nsugar—at the rate of £5 per 100 men, every six months, and, for the first\r\ntime, men invalided ashore were continued in pay till death or recovery.\r\nA special hospital was to be provided at Deal, and from 1st January 1653\r\nhalf the space in all English hospitals, as they became empty, to be\r\nreserved for the seamen.[1317]\r\n\r\nIn February and March 1653, Portsmouth, Deal and Dover were full of\r\nwounded men; surgeons were sent down to these towns, and seven shillings\r\na week granted for the support of each man. Judging from the returns, the\r\ndeath-rate among the injured was not so high as might have been expected,\r\nif the conditions existing at Portsmouth also obtained elsewhere. There\r\nthe sick were mostly in private or beer houses, which were said to be\r\nsmall and stifling, besides exposing their occupants to the temptation\r\nof drink; of the town itself the governor, Nath. Whetham, had nothing\r\ngood to say, dwelling on ‘the filthy nastiness of this place,’ unpaved,\r\nundrained, and enduring an epidemic of small-pox.[1318] The town must\r\nhave been continually full of suffering men, since for two months alone\r\nof 1654 the cost of the sick and hurt there was £2300, of which £580 went\r\nto the surgeons and £325 to the nurses.[1319]\r\n\r\nKnowing that they would be repaid any outlay, the civic authorities of\r\nthe coast towns were attentive to the wants of the invalids, and, for a\r\ntime, the government spent liberally in this direction. In August 1653\r\nthere were 1600 men at Aldborough, Ipswich, and adjacent villages, whose\r\ncharges amounted to some thousands of pounds, cleared in due course,\r\nwhile smaller sums of £958, £400, and £1366 were sent, on account, to\r\nDover, Weymouth, and Harwich; at Yarmouth between 3rd August 1653 and\r\n6th February 1655 £2851 was expended in the town for the same purpose.\r\nIn some respects the sick men were better off than their able-bodied\r\nfellows. Monk and Deane reproached the Admiralty Commissioners for\r\npaying the former their wages, but not the latter, and ‘we think it\r\nneither in reason nor conscience to employ men who must perish for want\r\nof clothes lost in the service, and whose families are starving, and yet\r\ntheir pay is due, their tickets signed, and their captains satisfied they\r\nwill not run away.’[1320]\r\n\r\nHitherto all the duty of superintendence had been thrown on the Navy\r\nCommissioners, but, in view of their protests that they were overwhelmed\r\nby their own more special work, a new department was created from 29th\r\nSeptember 1653, consisting of four commissioners at £150 a year each and\r\nfifteen subordinate officers, who divided £1090 a year between them. They\r\ntook the title of ‘Commissioners of sick and wounded at Little Britain,’\r\nwhere their office was situated, were to supervise the distribution\r\nof invalided men, provide surgeons and medicines, and control the\r\nauthorities of the towns. They had also to take charge of prisoners, see\r\nthat the convalescent returned to their ships, and were authorised to\r\ngrant gratuities up to £10 and pensions up to £6, 13s 4d.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pensions.]\r\n\r\nA pension or gratuity might be augmented by appeal to the Admiralty\r\nCommittee, although we may be certain that such a petition was rarely\r\nsuccessful, but the corresponding gifts to officers’ widows were on a\r\nmuch more liberal scale. To seven captains’ widows sums ranging from\r\n£400 to £1000 were granted in April 1653, and it seems a somewhat uneven\r\nascent from the seaman’s widow at £10 to the captain’s at £1000. So far\r\nas applicants of inferior rank were concerned, the Commissioners must\r\nhave had their time fully occupied if they investigated every case as\r\nclosely as that of Susan Cane. They held that £5 was enough for her,\r\nas she had not lived with her husband, led a loose life, and possessed\r\nmore than ordinary skill in making stockings. The institution of a new\r\nbenefaction caused new rogueries, and soon some of the office clerks\r\nwere levying commissions on the donations given to these women and\r\nwere in partnership with people who made real or false claims on their\r\nbehalf.[1321] In the two years ending with May 1656 some £12,000 had\r\nbeen disbursed on behalf of men sent on shore ill or injured;[1322] but\r\nit is apparent that, although the Commonwealth procedure compared very\r\nfavourably with the indifference which preceded it, the tender anxiety\r\nthe government displayed for the sailor’s welfare, when it had urgent\r\nneed of him, languished after the Dutch war and died away with the\r\nSpanish one. Later, in the year 1656, the bailiffs of Yarmouth wrote to\r\nthe Admiralty Commissioners that the Commissioners at Little Britain were\r\nnow careless about paying for the men sent on shore, leaving it to the\r\nbailiffs to spend the town money and get it back how or when they could.\r\nThe squadron before Mardike was considered very unhealthy, there being\r\nusually about ten per cent. sick, and when these were sent home they were\r\nsimply laid on the ballast and shot about by the pitching and rolling of\r\nthe ship;[1323] and another paper mentions the ‘noisome smells’ produced\r\nby the condition of these men. Fleets must, however, have been much\r\nhealthier than in earlier times, since on 24th March 1659 the number\r\nof sick in nearly 3000 men under Montagu was only nineteen, and but\r\nseventy-two in 2803 under Goodson.[1324]\r\n\r\nIn 1656 independent charities relating to the sick and maimed existed in\r\nthe shape of the Chatham Chest, Ely Place, the Savoy Hospital, and the\r\nCommissioners, and it was then suggested that they should be amalgamated,\r\nboth on account of economy and the prevention of fraud, but this was\r\nnever done. For several years the Treasurer of the Navy paid £735 a week\r\nfor the support of pensioners, but in what proportion this was divided\r\namong the foregoing charities is uncertain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Chatham Chest.]\r\n\r\nOf these institutions the only one of which we have any details is the\r\nChatham Chest. For the three years 1653-5 the accounts stand:—[1325]\r\n\r\n           Revenue[1326]   Revenue from Lands[1327]   Expenditure\r\n              £                 £  _s_ _d_             £  _s_ _d_\r\n  1653       5653              433  6   8          10,065  0   0\r\n  1654       4000[1328]        433  6   8            4531 18  10\r\n  1655       4000[1328]        433  6   8            4500  0   0[1329]\r\n\r\nThere was thus an excess of outlay over receipts, for these three\r\nyears, of more than £4000, and Edward Hayward, then in charge, asks for\r\nassistance from the central authority. He probably obtained it, as on\r\nanother occasion, Hutchinson was ordered to lend the Chest £3000.[1330]\r\nIn March 1656 a report was drawn up which made the income from land £382,\r\n10s a year, and recommended the removal of the Chest to London to save\r\nexpense and the inconveniences experienced by the men. From this report\r\nwe learn that officers’ widows were entitled to pensions from it, but not\r\nthose of the men.[1331] In June 1657 there were 800 or 900 pensioners,\r\nbut half the arrears were unpaid; a year later the situation was worse\r\nand the delay had reduced the men ‘to such extreme misery that I fear\r\nmany of them have perished of late,’ the writer, Pett, having been forced\r\nto leave Chatham to escape these outcries. Pett adds, ‘If Rochester\r\nCathedral were given to the governors to be improved ... it might go\r\ntowards paying the arrears.’\r\n\r\nThere are two references in the Commonwealth papers which suggest that\r\nHayward did not escape suspicion then of having appropriated Chest money\r\nto his own use, but in the inquiry into its management, begun in 1662,\r\nthe weight of scrutiny fell upon Pett. Hayward said that he had lost\r\nall the books relating to the years 1648-55, although he afterwards\r\nproduced some of them. From the interrogatories addressed to Pett we may\r\ninfer that he and captain John Taylor, who was jointly responsible with\r\nhim, amicably passed each other’s accounts; that the accuracy of these\r\naccounts was attested by only some of the officers who should have signed\r\nthem; that the same travelling expenses were entered three or four times\r\nover; that he and Taylor had taken large sums from the Chest as salary,\r\nno commissioner having ever before charged for his management; and that\r\nsuch items occurred as £52, 13s 4d for the governor’s dinners, etc., at\r\none meeting, £10 a year salary to a ‘mathematician,’ and £9 to Taylor\r\n‘for relief for a fall.’[1332]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Victualling.]\r\n\r\nThe quality of the food supplied to the men and the honesty of the\r\nvictualling agents both steadily deteriorated during the Commonwealth.\r\nComplaints began to be frequent about 1650, and a fresh contract was\r\nthen entered into with Colonel Pride and others to undertake the duty at\r\neightpence per head at sea, and sevenpence in harbour, the government\r\nbearing the cost of transport to fleets on service.[1333] The lax system\r\nin force was not, however, calculated to act as a deterrent; in May 1650\r\na victualling office clerk, who had embezzled £137, gave security for it,\r\nand was suspended, but, inferentially, only until the money was refunded.\r\nIt may be said that, generally, the object of the Navy authorities,\r\nin cases of fraud and embezzlement by clerks or officers, was not so\r\nmuch to punish as to obtain restitution. Possibly they found it to be\r\nthe most effective form of punishment. During 1652 the pressure caused\r\nby the necessity of supplying an unprecedentedly large number of men\r\nproduced more disorders in this branch of the service, and in June the\r\ncontractors were called before the Council, told that their explanations\r\nwere unsatisfactory, and heard the Admiralty Commissioners directed to\r\ncontinually watch and inspect the victuals furnished.\r\n\r\nThe story of the victualling arrangements during these eleven years\r\nbrings out the most striking point of difference between the Commonwealth\r\nadministration and those which were antecedent to it, in the fact that\r\nmatters affecting the health and comfort of seamen were not ignored\r\nas in previous periods. This, we know, was greatly due to political\r\nnecessity, but the letters remaining, written by officials of all ranks,\r\nshow that a conscientious recognition of justice due to the sailors, and\r\nof responsibility for their welfare, widely existed. This sentiment is\r\nmuch more clearly marked among captains, admirals, and commissioners than\r\namong the ruling politicians, although members of the government were\r\ndoubtless not unaffected by the prevailing spirit; the financial straits\r\nof the country, however, first cramped, and then destroyed, reforms which\r\notherwise might have become permanent.\r\n\r\nIn 1652 new buildings for the Victualling department were built in\r\nseveral ports; and from February 1650 the slaughterhouse at Deptford,\r\nstanding on ‘the poore’s ground’ and originally devoted to the service\r\nof Greenwich Palace, was taken for that of the state.[1334] In 1653 the\r\nrate rose to ninepence a head, and it may be roughly calculated that the\r\nVictuallers were called upon to provide at least some 7,500,000 lbs. of\r\nbread, 7,500,000 lbs. of beef and pork, and 10,000 butts of beer, besides\r\ncheese, butter, fish, and other necessaries. The mechanism at their\r\ncommand was little superior to that used by their predecessors under\r\nCharles I, and English agriculture could hardly yet have recovered from\r\nthe effects of the civil war. The victualling contracts between September\r\n1651 and December 1652 came to £332,000,[1335] a sum representing a\r\ndrain on the food resources of the country difficult to meet, not so\r\nmuch, perhaps, in quantity as in suddenness, although since 1648 there\r\nhad been an unbroken series of years of dearth. Remembering commissariat\r\nexperiences of our own, happening under much more favourable conditions\r\nwithin living memory, the wonder is, not that there should have been\r\ncomplaints, but that there should have been comparatively so few under\r\ncircumstances, which might almost have excused absolute failure.\r\nPride and his associates were condemned because they were judged by a\r\nhigher standard than had previously existed, but under Charles I their\r\nmanagement would have been praised as highly successful.\r\n\r\nWhen complaints came in they were not officially pigeon-holed but at once\r\ninquired into, and, so far as lay with the Admiralty Committee, the wants\r\nrelieved. On 17th May 1653, a captain reported that he had no medical\r\nextras; on the 19th the Navy Commissioners were ordered to examine into\r\nthis and remedy it; on 16th June the Generals of the fleet wrote about\r\nthe badness of the provisions, and on the 20th the Navy Commissioners\r\nwere directed to take the Victuallers to task. The beer was the most\r\nfrequent subject of protest, and the difficulty was met by sending water\r\nin its place, to the extent of 500 tuns at a time, the men being allowed\r\ntwopence a day to reconcile them to the change. At least one brewer laid\r\nthe blame on the prices paid him, and frankly said he could give nothing\r\nbetter for the money. Beer and other provisions, ‘decayed and unfit for\r\nuse,’ were licensed for export free of customs, perhaps in the hope that\r\nsuch stores would go to Holland. In October 1654 Pride and his colleagues\r\ngave notice of their intention to resign their contract, and, after some\r\ndebate, it was decided to constitute the Victualling a department under\r\nthe immediate care of the Navy Commissioners, captain Thos. Alderne being\r\nmade its head, with a salary of £500 a year.[1336] Alderne died 10th\r\nApril 1657, and was succeeded by three of the Navy Commissioners, majors\r\nRobt. Thompson, Neh. Bourne, and Fr. Willoughby, who were thenceforward\r\nstyled ‘Commissioners of Navy and Victualling,’ and who received an\r\nadditional £250 a year each for their services.[1337]\r\n\r\nAlderne and his successors may or may not have been competent, but they\r\nhad little chance of doing well under the financial embarrassments amid\r\nwhich they worked; they considered themselves fortunate in being able\r\nto continue supplies, of whatever quality, from hand to mouth. In June\r\n1655 bakers and brewers were petitioning the Admiralty Committee, that\r\nalthough in January they had been promised monthly cash payments, not\r\none penny had yet been paid them. The whole of one long despatch of\r\nBlake’s[1338] is made up of complaints about the provisions sent out, and\r\ncensure of the officials at home. We, who have wider knowledge than Blake\r\ncould then have, now know that the defaults were due to the situation\r\nrather than to the men. Orders might be given in London, but the local\r\ncontractors were either not properly controlled, or, more probably, were\r\ndefiant, knowing that the Admiralty could hardly go on provisioning the\r\nfleets without the credit they gave it. If the seamen protested to those\r\nindividuals they obtained scant consideration. Some of the _Tiger’s_\r\ncrew went ashore at Harwich to show the victualling agent their bread\r\nand beer which, their captain agreed, was not fit for food. The agent\r\nsent for the baker and brewer, and the former told the men that they were\r\n‘mutinous rogues,’ that it was good enough for their betters, and next\r\ntime should be worse. In another port the local agent told the purser of\r\nthe _Maidstone_, whose men had shown provisions absolutely putrid, and to\r\nwhom he had promised improvement when they were before him, that the more\r\nthey complained the worse they should have. This coming to the ears of\r\nthe men, some of the _Maidstone’s_ crew went ashore and wrecked his house.\r\n\r\nAs the end of the Commonwealth approached matters became as bad as they\r\ncould well be. At Plymouth, in January 1660, the victualler reported\r\nthat he had been obtaining stores hitherto on his own credit, but\r\nwould do so no longer; that there were six ships in port with starving\r\ncrews, and another six expected, and that the only way open to him was\r\nto turn the men ashore to shift for themselves.[1339] In February the\r\nNavy Commissioners warned their chiefs that, unless money was provided\r\nwithin a week, there would be a failure of provisions everywhere, and\r\nthat having done their utmost by persuasion they must be acquitted of\r\nblame. Judging from the number of their letters still existing, the Navy\r\nCommissioners must, about this time, have been pressing the Admiralty\r\nCommittee for money nearly every day, either for wages or stores; it\r\nwas not their fault if any one remained unpaid. Warrants authorising\r\nrevictualling were posted freely, but, as captain Heaton wrote from\r\nPlymouth, nothing was said about the money, without which they were of no\r\nuse. Heaton describes graphically the cruel poverty to which some of the\r\ntownspeople there, who had trusted the government, were reduced:—\r\n\r\n    One cries, ‘For God’s sake spare me £20 to keep me out of\r\n    prison;’ another begs for money to buy his family meat to eat,\r\n    and to-day I saw a poor women beg of Mr Addis ten shillings of\r\n    her due, to buy her four poor children bread, as for alms. Not\r\n    long since a baker with sad complaints prevailed with Mr Addis\r\n    for £23, and was as glad of it as though the money had been a\r\n    free gift.’[1340]\r\n\r\nWhile this letter was travelling up to London two others, of the same\r\ndate, were coming from Hull. One, from the captain of the _Bryer_ to the\r\nAdmiralty Committee, says that he has already written nine times to them,\r\nand that his officers are compelled to buy their own food, and his men to\r\nforage for themselves on shore; the other, from the victualling agent at\r\nHull, acknowledges the receipt of their warrant to furnish the _Bryer_\r\nand _Forester_, but, before acting on it, desires to know how he is to\r\nbe paid. Truly the pious hope of captain Harman, of the _Kentish_, that\r\nLawson would ‘be an instrument of bringing the victualling to its former\r\nsplendour,’ was one not likely to lack fulfilment for want of occasion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Medals and Rewards.]\r\n\r\nIt had long been customary to give medals and chains to distinguished\r\nofficers, but Parliament, for the first time, extended this form of\r\ndistinction to the men. The first reference is a somewhat doubtful one,\r\nbeing an order of the House of 15th Nov. 1649, for medals for ‘several\r\nmariners’ who had done good service the previous year, but who may\r\npossibly have been officers. About the second, however, there is no\r\nquestion. In 1650 captain Wyard, of the _Adventure_, a hired merchantman,\r\nfought a gallant action off Harwich against greatly superior force, and\r\nhe, his officers, and crew were awarded medals of different values,\r\nranging from the one of £50 intended for himself down to others worth 5s\r\nfor the men, each ‘with the service against five ships engraved on one\r\nside and the arms of the Commonwealth on the other.’[1341] There were at\r\nleast 20,000 men employed during 1652-4, but the whole number of medals\r\nfor the war was only 169; of these 79 were small ones, and may have\r\nbeen intended for the seamen, although, as they were all of gold, it is\r\nunlikely. Nine of the larger ones were with chains, the smaller weighed\r\n18dwt. 11gr. each, and the total cost was £2060. One alone had ‘the\r\nservice done in the _Triumph_ expressed on it.’[1342] Blake and Monk had\r\nchains worth £300 a piece given them, and Penn one of the value of £100.\r\nThe government was never unduly liberal in dealing with naval men. Major\r\nFr. White, for bringing the news of Dunbar to London, was given £300;\r\ncapt. Young, for following the Spanish fleet for a week in 1657, and then\r\nseeking Blake with the information which enabled him to destroy it at\r\nSanta Cruz, was granted £100.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Seamen’s Clothing.]\r\n\r\nThe sale of clothes to the men was not confined to any one vendor, and\r\nscandals in this department, if they existed, do not appear to have\r\nattracted the attention of the authorities till 1655. Then an order was\r\nissued from the Navy Office that, ‘upon the consideration of the several\r\nabuses done by those that serve the state’s ships with clothes, by\r\nexorbitant prices and bad goods, to the prejudice of the poor seamen,’\r\nthe clothiers were not to send any on board ship without the permission\r\nof the Navy Commissioners.[1343] Two months later prices were fixed as\r\nfollows[1344]:—\r\n\r\n                      _s_ _d_\r\n  Canvas jackets       1  10 each\r\n    ”    drawers       1   8  ”\r\n  Cotton waistcoats    2  2 each\r\n    ”    drawers       2   0  ”\r\n  Shirts               2   9 each\r\n  Shoes                2   4 a pair\r\n  Linen stockings      0  10   ”\r\n  Cotton    ”          0  10   ”\r\n\r\nThis outfit, if a complete one, does not seem all that could be desired\r\nfor winter service in the Channel, although it is a nearer approach\r\nto a uniform than existed much later. The Commissioners were careful\r\nto repudiate any responsibility for the clothes,[1345] though, as we\r\nsee, they interfered when they considered it necessary, and allowed a\r\nsum, usually £2, to each man if his kit had been lost in action or by\r\nshipwreck.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Navy List.]\r\n\r\nCompared with the accessions of previous reigns the following list of\r\nnew vessels is startling in its magnitude, and the cost of building\r\nand maintenance is another item which helps to account for the chronic\r\ndifficulties besetting the Treasurer of the Navy[1346]:—\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------+-----+-----+------------+------------+----+-----\r\n  |                       |Prize|Built|    At      |     By     |Net |Gross\r\n  |                       |     |     |            |            | Tonnage\r\n  +-----------------------+-----+-----+------------+------------+----+-----\r\n  |                       |     |     |            |            |    |\r\n  |  1 _Fairfax_          |     | 1649|Deptford    |            | 789|\r\n  |  2 _Guinea_(B)[1347]  |     | 1649|            |            | 375|  500\r\n  |  3 _Jermyn_*          | 1649|     |            |            |    |\r\n  |  4 _President_[1348]  |     | 1649|Deptford    |P.

added to the Navy during these eleven years,\r\nof which 121 were on the active list in 1660; besides 22 others still\r\nremaining of the old Royal Navy and 17 more, originally of the same\r\nera, which had been used but had been sold, wrecked, or lost in action\r\nbetween 1649 and 1660. We are told that ‘the principal thing the Long\r\nParliament aimed at was to outsail the Dunkirkers,’[1359] and the\r\nlarge number of light vessels of twenty-two guns, or under, shows how\r\nearnestly they set themselves to this task. In a few cases the names of\r\nold ships were altered—the _Charles_ to _Liberty_, the _Henrietta Maria_\r\nto _Paragon_, the _Prince_ to _Resolution_, and the _St Andrew_ and _St\r\nGeorge_ lost their saintship. The _Sovereign_ is, once or twice, called\r\nthe _Commonwealth_, but here the proposed change of name never became an\r\nactual one.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Alterations and Improvements.]\r\n\r\nIn October 1651 the Council of State were considering ‘some encouragement\r\nto be given to Messrs Pett for their success in contriving and building\r\nof frigates.’ The improvements consisted, we may be certain, in moulding\r\nthe under-water section on finer lines, and probably in reducing the\r\nheight of the hull above water and lengthening the keel by lessening the\r\nrake, fore and aft, and so diminishing the undue proportion the length\r\n‘over all’ bore to the keel. Such alterations would have tended to abate\r\nthe pitching, from which these old ships must have suffered terribly, to\r\nhave given them a steadier gun platform, and to make them more weatherly,\r\nalthough from the journal of the _Gainsborough_ it appears that she,\r\nat any rate, was nearly unable to beat to windward.[1360] At first the\r\nnew frigates, of whatever class, were built without forecastles, but\r\nexperience led to the conclusion that they were advisable in the larger\r\nships, it being found necessary sometimes to run them up at sea, and\r\neventually only fifth- and sixth-rates were still built without them.\r\nBut this was an advance on the old system, which had constructed the\r\nsmallest vessels on exactly the same plan as the largest. Beyond Pett’s\r\nimprovements, which really belong to the period of Charles I rather\r\nthan to that of the Commonwealth, there was little progress in matters\r\nrelating to sails and the better adjustment of weights. Fore and aft\r\nsails are still rarely mentioned, and then only in connection with small\r\nvessels, and there is no record of the introduction of any mechanical\r\nappliances calculated to lighten or quicken the physical work necessary\r\nin handling a ship. The sail area was still small for the tonnage, nor,\r\nin view of the crankness of the ships, did it appear possible to increase\r\nit. The _Sovereign_, cut down in 1652, and then of 100 guns and 2072\r\ngross tonnage,[1361] carried 5513 yards of canvas in a complete suit of\r\nsails;[1362] in 1844 the regulation equipment for a second-rate of 84\r\nguns and 2279 tons (the _Thunderer_), was 12,947 yards. Of course the\r\nline-of-battle ship of 1844 would be in reality a much bigger vessel than\r\nthe _Sovereign_, but the excess in length and breadth would not alone\r\nexplain the ability to bear more than double the extent of canvas.\r\n\r\nAs had been customary for at least 150 years, each ship possessed three\r\nboats—long boat, pinnace, and skiff—which were respectively 35 feet, 29\r\nfeet, and 20 feet long in those belonging to second-rates, and 33 feet,\r\n28 feet, and 20 feet in third-rates. In no list of equipments or stores\r\nare davits mentioned. The long boat was apparently still towed astern;\r\nit invariably was in 1625, since the Cadiz fleet of that year lost every\r\nlong boat in crossing the Bay of Biscay. How the other boats were now\r\nhoisted to the ship is uncertain.[1363]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shipbuilding.]\r\n\r\nEarly in the Commonwealth administration John Holland, one of the Navy\r\nCommissioners, recommended that the service shipwrights should not be\r\nallowed to keep private yards, seeing that if they were dishonest there\r\nwas no way of tracing government timber, or other materials, used for\r\ntheir own purposes, a reason which does not say much for government\r\nmethods of supervision. But the state yards were obviously inadequate to\r\nthe demands suddenly made upon their capacity, and recourse was necessary\r\nto the yards belonging to government shipwrights and to private builders.\r\nIn 1650 and 1651 the _Pelican_, _Primrose_, _Pearl_, _Nightingale_, and\r\n_Mermaid_ were bought in this way, the first at £6, 10s, the others at\r\n£5, 8s a ton.[1364] Vessels built in private yards were subjected to\r\ncontinual inspection at the hands of the government surveyors, and, in\r\nmany cases, the materials were supplied by the Navy Commissioners, who\r\nonly desired such prices for them ‘as shall be moderate and fit between\r\nman and man.’\r\n\r\nDuring 1651-53 Parliament was continually ordering new frigates to be\r\ncommenced, and the master shipwrights who possessed building slips seem\r\nto have tried to get the work placed in their own yards rather than\r\nin the government ones. In April 1652, when two new vessels were to\r\nbe commenced, Peter Pett and Taylor recommended that they should be\r\ngiven out to contract, as there was not enough timber in the government\r\nstores. Whatever may have been the knowledge or sense of duty possessed\r\nby some of their subordinates, the Commonwealth Navy Commissioners\r\nwere the wrong men upon whom to try _finesse_, more appropriate to the\r\npreceding or following administrations. All that Pett and Taylor obtained\r\nby their move was an intimation that they, at all events, would not be\r\nallowed to compete, and this was followed by an urgent recommendation\r\nto the Admiralty Committee that, as there was in reality plenty of\r\ntimber available, the two men should be ordered to proceed with the\r\nwork at once in the state’s yards.[1365] On other occasions the London\r\nshipwrights combined to put pressure on the Admiralty by refusing to\r\ntender below certain rates, and Edmond Edgar, of Great Yarmouth, based\r\na claim to consideration on the fact that he had cut in and broken down\r\nthe combination.[1366] There are several petitions, like this one of\r\nEdgar’s, from shipbuilders, for compensation on account of vessels turned\r\nout from their yards larger than had been specified in the original\r\ncontracts, and thereby exposing them to loss. As the Admiralty tried to\r\nbe just rather than generous in dealing with contractors, we may suppose\r\nthat the miscalculations, like those which occurred under Charles I,\r\nwere due really to ignorance rather than to a not very hopeful attempt\r\nto obtain larger profits by deliberately ignoring instructions. Country\r\nbuilders, moreover, sometimes worked under difficulties they could\r\nscarcely have anticipated when tendering. Bailey, who built two ships at\r\nBristol, desired the government to authorise him to pay his men more than\r\ntwo shillings a day, and thus free him from the liability to ten days’\r\nimprisonment and a £10 fine incurred, according to the city ordinances,\r\nby those who paid more.[1367]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Decoration.]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the tendency of the time the decoration of ships was\r\nreduced to a minimum. Until 1655 the use of gilding appears to have\r\nceased, special orders being in some cases given that vessels under\r\nrepair were not to have any gold used upon them, and the cost of carved\r\nwork in fifth-rates was fixed at £45, an amount which was not passed\r\nwithout serious questioning. In 1655 this severe simplicity was, to a\r\ncertain extent, relaxed, since, in August, Richard Isaacson undertook\r\nthe gilding and painting of two second-rates at £120 each. So far as\r\nthe outside was concerned, the figurehead, arms on stern, and two\r\nfigures on the stern gallery were to be gilt; the hull, elsewhere, was\r\nto be painted black, picked out in gold where carved.[1368] The Navy\r\nCommissioners held that the decoration ought not to cost more than £80,\r\nbeing unnecessary and ‘like feathers in fantastic caps.’ Figure heads\r\nwere sometimes exuberant in style. The _Naseby’s_ consisted of Oliver on\r\nhorseback, ‘trampling upon six nations.’\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relation between Tonnage and Guns.]\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the equipment in offensive weapons and stores\r\nfor typical vessels of each rate; the scale was not implicitly adhered\r\nto, but it is the first sign of an attempt to establish a permanent\r\nrelation between guns and tonnage such as became afterwards almost\r\ninvariable. The paper belongs to 1655, but it is not likely that any\r\nmaterial alteration occurred before 1660.[1369] The first establishment\r\nof third-rates was 140, of fourth-rates 130, and of fifth-rates 100 men;\r\nthese were subsequently raised to 160, 150, and 110 men respectively:—\r\n\r\n  +------------------------+------+------+---------+---------+------+-----+\r\n  |

been\r\nbuilt as men-of-war, and, as soon as the immediate need had ceased, were\r\nsold, if only for the momentary relief the money thus obtained gave the\r\nharassed treasury. In one year, ending with October 1654, nine were\r\nsold for £6181. Notwithstanding the enormous increase in the strength\r\nof the Navy the Commissioners found it hardly equal to the provision\r\nof the over-sea fleets, now required, and the fifty or sixty cruisers\r\nin the four seas which replaced the half-dozen small vessels formerly\r\nconsidered sufficient, and which number, relatively large as it was,\r\ndid not succeed in entirely crushing the enterprise of the Dunkirk and\r\nStewart privateers. The recollection of what commerce had suffered from\r\npiracy must have remained very lively, and, at the close of the civil\r\nwar, strong summer and winter ‘guards’ were still maintained; in October\r\n1651 there were thirty-six vessels cruising in home waters.[1371] During\r\nthe Dutch war every available ship was needed with the fleets, and the\r\nChannel was sometimes so devoid of protection that two prizes, taken off\r\nthe Land’s End in December 1653, were brought up Channel to Flushing\r\nwithout, during the six days occupied in the voyage, and of which one was\r\nspent in lying to off Dungeness, meeting a single English man-of-war.\r\n\r\nWhen peace was made with Holland the protective cordon round the coasts\r\nwas renewed, and increased rather than decreased in strength during\r\nthe last years of the Commonwealth. To illustrate the way in which the\r\nships were employed one station list for May 1659 may be quoted.[1372]\r\nIn the Downs, 12, of 232 guns; watching Ostend, 3, of 70 guns; off the\r\nmouth of the Thames, 2, of 12 guns; between the Naze and Yarmouth, 2,\r\nof 34 guns; off Lynn Deeps, 2, of 20 guns; between Yarmouth Roads and\r\nTynemouth Bar, 3, of 66 guns; on Scotch coast, 2, of 52 guns; with the\r\nmackerel boats, 2, of 24 guns; with the North Sea boats, 1, of — guns;\r\nin mouth of Channel, 4, of 76 guns; between Portland and Alderney, 2, of\r\n26 guns; on Irish coast, 3, of 50 guns; on convoy service, 8, of — guns;\r\nand 6 others have not their duties specified. The large increase in the\r\neffective of the Navy diminished the necessity for hired merchantmen, and\r\nthe need became less as the Dutch prizes were refitted for service. The\r\ncaste feeling which divides the professional from the amateur fighter\r\nwas beginning to be strongly marked among officers who had gone through\r\nthe experiences of the civil war, and who by a succession of events had\r\nbeen retained in the service of the state instead of being returned to\r\nmercantile pursuits, as had been the case formerly on the cessation\r\nof warfare. Both these causes helped to do away with the use of hired\r\nmerchantmen, although at one time thirty or forty were in pay. Blake\r\ndesired that not more than two-fifths of the fleets should consist of\r\nhired ships, that they should carry at least twenty-six guns, and be\r\ncommanded and officered by approved men. The proportion does not appear\r\nto have risen to this figure even before prizes became plentiful, and so\r\neager was the government to adapt suitable prizes that it did not always\r\nwait for legal condemnation, and sometimes found itself compelled to make\r\nterms with the injured owners when the ship had been used and sold out\r\nof the service. After long efforts the owners of the _Golden Falcon_,\r\ncaptured in 1652, obtained, in March 1659, a decree of the Admiralty\r\nCourt in their favour; but the vessel had been sold a year before, and\r\nthe Navy Commissioners were ordered to pay her appraised value when\r\ntaken. Nor is this a solitary instance.[1373]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Merchant Shipping.]\r\n\r\nIn 1652 there was a survey of merchant shipping throughout the kingdom,\r\nbut the resulting reports have not survived. In December 1653 there\r\nappear to have been only sixty-three merchantmen, of 200 tons and\r\nupwards, in the Thames suitable for service; but the size of these does\r\nnot show much advance on the tonnage of the previous generation; one was\r\nof 600, four of 500, two of 450, five of 400, twenty-five of from 300 to\r\n400, and the remainder under 300 tons.[1374] According to one (royalist)\r\nwriter both the merchant navy and trade decreased under the Commonwealth;\r\nbut the customs receipts directly contradict the latter and inferentially\r\nnegative the former portion of his statement.[1375] Store ships and\r\ntransports were paid for at the rate of £3, 15s 6d a month per man, the\r\nowners sending them completely ready for sea. If a ship was meant to go\r\ninto action the state took the risk of loss, paid and provisioned the\r\nmen, and supplied powder, shot, and any guns necessary beyond the normal\r\nnumber. When stores were sent out as part of an ordinary trader’s cargo,\r\nthe cost of freight was, to the Straits of Gibraltar, from 40s to 44s a\r\nton; to Alicante, 50s to 54s; to Leghorn, 60s to 64s; and to Jamaica,\r\n£4.[1376]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Privateering.]\r\n\r\nPrivate enterprise turned naturally towards letters of marque as\r\na lucrative, if hazardous, speculation. In July 1652 letters were\r\nrestricted to owners able to send out vessels of not less than 200 tons\r\nand 20 guns, but it was soon found out that this limitation was almost\r\nprohibitive. Such privateers were further placed under the direct control\r\nof the admirals, and compelled to keep them and the Council informed\r\nof their proceedings.[1377] Afterwards letters of marque were more\r\ncharily issued, since it was found that they were competing for men\r\nagainst the regular service, much to the disadvantage of the latter,\r\nthe looser discipline and larger chance of prize money of the privateer\r\nbeing much more to the sailor’s liking. Frequently ordinary trading\r\nships sailed with letters of marque among their papers on the chance\r\nof some profitable opportunity occurring; but from 1st August 1655 all\r\nsuch commissions were, without exception, revoked, in consequence of\r\nthe difficulty their possessors seemed often to find in distinguishing\r\nbetween the ships of enemies and those belonging to friendly states.\r\nThenceforward, although still at war with Spain, Englishmen acting\r\nunder them were to find themselves in the position, and liable to the\r\npunishment, of pirates.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Caroline Ships lost or sold.]\r\n\r\nBesides the losses of the Commonwealth Navy in the ships, from 1649\r\nonwards, noted in connection with their names in the preceding list, the\r\nfollowing vessels of the old Navy were lost or sold; as well as various\r\nprizes dating from the civil war, and merchantmen bought during the same\r\nperiod, not here entered:—\r\n\r\n  _Bonaventure_, lost in action.\r\n  _Charles_, wrecked.\r\n  _Crescent_, broken up.\r\n  _Defiance_, sold.\r\n  _Garland_, lost in action.\r\n  _Greyhound_, lost in action.\r\n  _Happy Entrance_, burnt at Chatham.\r\n  _Henrietta_, sold.\r\n  _Henrietta Maria_, burnt in West Indies.\r\n  _Leopard_, lost in action.\r\n  _Mary Rose_, wrecked.\r\n  _Merhonour_, sold.\r\n  _Nicodemus_,  ”\r\n  _Roebuck_,    ”\r\n  _1st Whelp_,  ”\r\n  _2nd Whelp_,  ”\r\n  _10th Whelp_, ”\r\n\r\nThe _Bonaventure_, _Garland_, and _Leopard_ were lost to the Dutch, but\r\nthe two former were burnt and sunk when fighting under the Dutch flag in\r\nJuly 1653. The _Merhonour_, _Defiance_, and _2nd Whelp_, all three long\r\nlaid up as useless, were handed over to Taylor in 1650, at a valuation\r\nof £700, in part payment of his shipbuilding bill; the _1st Whelp_ was\r\nused for some time as a hulk at Deptford, and the _10th Whelp_ remained\r\nin commission till 1654. The _Greyhound_ was blown up in action with two\r\nprivateers, in 1656, by her captain, Geo. Wager, when she was boarded and\r\npractically taken by 100 of the enemy, who went up with her.[1378] The\r\n_Henrietta Maria_ and _Happy Entrance_ were burnt by accident in 1655 and\r\n1658; the _Mary Rose_ was wrecked off the coast of Flanders in 1650, and\r\nthe _Charles_ off Harwich in the same year.\r\n\r\nWhenever ships were lost on the British coasts the authorities did their\r\nbest to recover the stores, and, in the case of the _Charles_, men were\r\nstill engaged in 1660 patiently fishing for her guns. At first Bulmer,\r\na man whose name has been mentioned under Charles I as an inventor in\r\nconnection with maritime matters, was employed, but it was not until May\r\n1657, after seven years of search, that he triumphantly announced that\r\nhe had discovered her exact position. He was succeeded by Robert Willis,\r\ndescribed as a diver, who was more fortunate in that he did at last\r\nrecover at least two brass guns, for which he was allowed 20s a cwt. As\r\nthe Admiralty had been for eight years at the expense of a hired hoy and\r\nthe wages of the men occupied in work, it might have been cheaper to have\r\nallowed the guns to remain under water. The methods used are not alluded\r\nto, but, as the diving-bell was described by Bacon in the beginning of\r\nthe century, it must have been a well-known appliance; and Bourne had\r\ndescribed a diving dress on the modern principle in 1578.\r\n\r\nOne other man-of-war, the _Phœnix_, belonging to Badiley’s squadron, was\r\ncaptured on 7th September 1652 by the Dutch off Leghorn, and gallantly\r\nretaken in November by eighty-two volunteers, under captain Owen Cox, who\r\nboarded her at daybreak while at anchor amidst the enemy’s fleet. Cox\r\ndid not disdain to eke out the lion’s with the fox’s skin, since, in the\r\nafternoon, he hired ‘a bumboat or two with good wine to go aboard and\r\nsell it cheap;’ the Dutch were consequently keeping a careless watch, but\r\nfighting continued below for two hours after the ship was under way. Cox\r\nfurther promised £10 to each man with him, but this was still unpaid in\r\nJune 1653, and he then tells the Council of State that the men ‘persecute\r\nhim to fulfil his engagement’; and Badiley wrote that ‘since their\r\nexploit they are very turbulent and disorderly.’ Cox was granted £500 for\r\nhis good service;[1379] he was killed in the action of July 1653, while\r\nstill in command of the _Phœnix_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Piracy.]\r\n\r\nComplaints of piracy, in the strict sense, are very few during this\r\nperiod, and there is not a single reference to the presence of a Turk\r\nin the narrow seas. In face of the Commonwealth Navy there were no more\r\nof such incidents as the sack of Baltimore. The French, Dutch, and\r\nSpanish privateers, who kept our men-of-war continually on the alert,\r\nand occasionally overpowered a smaller one, sailed under some sort of\r\ncommission, either from their own states or the Stewarts, and did not,\r\ntherefore, possess that freedom from responsibility which in warfare\r\nsoon degenerates into savagery. The owners of the _Constant Cavalier_,\r\nfor instance, cruising under a commission from the nominal Charles II,\r\nhad to give a bond for £1000 not to injure his allies or his loyal\r\nsubjects.[1380] That the Dunkirkers and others found privateering by no\r\nmeans so easy a road to fortune as it had been in the days of Charles\r\nI is sufficiently shown by the number of their captured ships taken\r\ninto the national service, besides the loss of many more not considered\r\nsuitable for that purpose. Their best opportunity was during the Dutch\r\nwar, when the cruisers were mostly withdrawn to strengthen the fleets:\r\nbut even then the government usually managed to provide convoys for the\r\ncoasting trade. English, Scotch, or Irish seamen taken in a privateer\r\nwere summarily transported to the plantations.[1381]\r\n\r\nIn 1656 for some reason, probably the effort to keep the fleets on\r\nforeign service at their full strength, the guard round the coasts seems\r\nto have been temporarily relaxed, and the result was that ‘the Ostenders\r\nand Dunkirkers begin to grow numerous.’ On the east coast they were so\r\nsuccessful for the moment that, dreaming hopefully that the old times\r\nwere about to return, they desired some of their released prisoners to\r\n‘tell the Protector that while he is fetching gold from the West Indies\r\nthey will fetch his coals from Newcastle.’[1382] Oliver was not a safe\r\nsubject for threats, and their spoon was certainly not long enough to\r\nenable them to enjoy in comfort the meal they proposed sharing with him;\r\nat any rate very shortly afterwards the war was carried into the enemy’s\r\ncountry by the blockade of Ostend and Dunkirk, and there are no more\r\nlamentations about the number of them at sea, or the mischief they were\r\ndoing, until the very eve of the Restoration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Administration:—The Committees.]\r\n\r\nThe administrative direction of the Navy was, at the beginning of the\r\nCommonwealth, placed in the hands of (i.) the Admiralty Committee of the\r\nCouncil of State,[1383] (ii.) the Committee of Merchants of Navy and\r\nCustoms, and (iii.) the Commissioners of the Navy. The second Committee\r\ntook no practical part in the administration, was early requested to\r\nleave the management to the Navy Commissioners, ‘as formerly,’[1384] and\r\nwas dissolved in 1654. Warwick’s second appointment as Lord Admiral was\r\ncancelled by a parliamentary ordinance of 23rd Feb. 1649, and the first\r\nAdmiralty Committee of the Council of State took over his duties from\r\nthat date for the one year for which the Council of State was only itself\r\nexistent. This Committee was renewed yearly until the Protectorate,\r\nwhen ‘Commissioners of the Admiralty and Navy’ were nominated by act of\r\nParliament, and the control of the Ordnance department was also given\r\nthem.[1385] Their number varied but was seldom less than twelve or\r\nfifteen; they met at first at Whitehall once a week, during the Dutch war\r\nonce a day, and, from January 1655, occupied Derby House at a rental of\r\n£100 a year. Following the fall of Richard Cromwell an act was passed,\r\n21st May 1659,[1386] nominally vesting authority in ‘Commissioners for\r\ncarrying on the affairs of the Admiralty and Navy,’ but power really\r\nremained in the hands of Parliament to which the Commissioners had to\r\nsubmit the names of even the captains they appointed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Administration:—The Navy Commissioners.]\r\n\r\nThe brunt of administrative work and responsibility fell, however, on\r\nthe Navy Commissioners, who, so far as may be judged from the letters\r\nand papers relating to them and their work, laboured with an attention\r\nto the minutest details of their daily duties, a personal eagerness to\r\nensure perfection, and a broad sense of their ethical relation towards\r\nthe seamen and workmen, of whom they were at once the employers and\r\nprotectors, with a success the Admiralty never attained before and has\r\nnever equalled since. The earliest Commissioners were John Holland, Thos.\r\nSmith, Peter Pett, Robt. Thompson, and Col. Wm. Willoughby;[1387] the\r\nlast-named died in 1651, and was replaced by Robt. Moulton, who himself\r\ndied the next year. In 1653, Col. Fr. Willoughby, Ed. Hopkins, and\r\nmajor Neh. Bourne, who, besides being a soldier had also commanded the\r\n_Speaker_, were added to the first four. In 1654 Geo. Payler replaced\r\nHolland, and from then there was no change till 1657, when Nathan Wright\r\nsucceeded Hopkins. All the Navy Commissioners, except Holland, had £250 a\r\nyear, a sum for which they gave better value than did the members of the\r\nAdmiralty Committee for their £400 a year; but for 1653 each was granted\r\nan extra £150 in consideration of the excessive and continuous toil of\r\nthat year.\r\n\r\nFrom the first they adopted a tone towards the Admiralty Committee\r\nwhich would hardly have been endurable but that it was excused by an\r\nobvious honesty, and justified by superior knowledge. Early in 1649\r\nthey recommended that the rope-makers at Woolwich should have their\r\nwages increased by twopence a day, but their letter was returned by the\r\nAdmiralty Committee, probably with a reprimand. This was not to be borne\r\nin silence, so ‘we have cause to resent that we are so misunderstood\r\nas to be inhibited by you to do our duty.’ If the Committee has not\r\nitself power to make the order it can move Parliament, ‘who will not\r\nsee men want, especially as in the sweat of these men’s brows consists\r\nnot only their particular living but also that of the republic.... What\r\ninterpretation soever may be made of our actions by those that have\r\nthe supervision of them we shall not fail to represent the grievances\r\nof those under our charge when they represent them to us.’[1388]\r\nOn 22nd May 1649 the admirals and captains at sea were ordered to\r\naddress the Commissioners direct on all administrative details, thus\r\nleaving only matters of the highest importance to be dealt with by the\r\nAdmiralty Committee. In some ways the relative position of superiors and\r\ninferiors seems to have been reversed, for, on one occasion, we find\r\nthe Committee writing to the Commissioners about a course of action the\r\nformer had decided on, that, ‘as you disapprove’ of such procedure, it\r\nwas not to be adopted; and it frequently happened that the Council of\r\nState communicated directly with the Navy Commissioners, ignoring the\r\nintermediate Admiralty Committee.\r\n\r\nDuring the Dutch war a Commissioner was stationed in charge of each of\r\nthe principal yards—Pett at Chatham, Willoughby at Portsmouth, and Bourne\r\nat Harwich, which last place, in consequence of the operations on the\r\nNorth Sea and off the Dutch coast, had suddenly sprung into importance.\r\nMonk wrote concerning Bourne: ‘It is strange that twenty ships should be\r\nso long fitting out from Chatham, Woolwich, and Deptford, where there are\r\nso many docks ... when there have been twenty-two or more fitted out from\r\nHarwich in half the time by Major Bourne.’[1389] There is a consensus of\r\nevidence as to the way in which Bourne threw his heart into his work, and\r\nthe success he obtained under difficulties due to the want of docks and\r\nmaterials at Harwich and an insufficient number of men. Notwithstanding\r\nMonk’s depreciatory reference to Chatham, Pett was very well satisfied\r\nwith his operations there. A few months before he had reported to the\r\nAdmiralty Committee that he had graved nine ships in one spring tide,\r\nwithout injury to ship or man; ‘truly it makes me stand amazed at the\r\ngoodness of God in such unparalleled successes.’\r\n\r\nBesides their superintendence of the building, repairing, and fitting\r\nout of ships, the purchase and distribution of stores, the control of the\r\ndockyards, and all the diverse minutiæ of administration in war time, the\r\nCommissioners were called upon to maintain the not very rigid discipline\r\nof the service. Hitherto all ranks had been allowed to do much as they\r\npleased when ships were in port, but henceforth no captain was to leave\r\nhis command for more than six hours without the express permission of\r\neither the Admiralty or Navy Commissioners, and during any such absence\r\nthe lieutenant, or the master, was to remain on board; for the first\r\ndisobedience the penalty was a fine of one month’s pay, for the second\r\nthree months’, and for the third to be cashiered. Similar rules applied\r\nto all the officers; and men absent without leave forfeited a month’s\r\npay. The clerks of the check[1390] were to ‘take an exact account’ how\r\nofficers and others performed their duties, and once a week report to the\r\nNavy Commissioners, a regulation which, if loyally obeyed, must have made\r\nthe clerks popular. The clerks of the check attached to the dockyards\r\nwere to similarly watch the clerks on shipboard, and, in turn, report\r\non them once a week to the Commissioners.[1391] This system was akin to\r\nthat of the sixteenth-century Spanish navy, in which the duties were so\r\narranged that each officer was a spy on another; admirable in theory, it\r\ndid not suit English idiosyncrasies, and these reports never took any\r\npractical shape.\r\n\r\nFrom 2nd June 1649, the Navy Commissioners had occupied rooms in the\r\nvictualling office at Tower Hill, but in 1653 they found the annoyance\r\ncaused by the proximity of the victuallers’ slaughterhouses there to\r\nbe unbearable. It was not, however, till the next year that Sir John\r\nWolstenholme’s house in Seething Lane was purchased for them for £2400,\r\nand became the Navy Office for a long period;[1392] the Treasurer’s,\r\nnow a quite distinct office, was in Leadenhall Street, and its lease\r\nwas renewed in February 1657 for eight years at a rental of £49, 6s 8d\r\na year and a £700 fine. The next request of the Commissioners was that\r\ntheir number might be increased, as half the members of the Board were\r\nconstantly away in charge of dockyards, and for this they ‘desire timely\r\nremedy or dismissal from our employment.’ It has been noticed that three\r\nnew men, of whom certainly two—Bourne and Willoughby—were, in their\r\nsphere, amongst the ablest administrators who have ever served the state,\r\nwere in consequence added in 1653. Besides the Commissioners, Thomas\r\nWhite at Dover, captain Hen. Hatsell at Plymouth, major Richard Elton at\r\nHull, and major William Burton at Yarmouth, acting as Admiralty agents,\r\nhad nearly as much work and responsibility, and executed it as ably, as\r\ntheir more highly placed colleagues.\r\n\r\nIn 1655 the salaries of subordinates at the Admiralty amounted to\r\n£1740, the secretary, Robert Blackborne, receiving £250. The first\r\nsecretary of the Admiralty Committee, Robert Coytmore, had £150 a year,\r\nof which £50 was regarded as an extra given on condition that neither\r\nhe nor his clerk received fees—a stipulation probably due to a lively\r\nrecollection of the habits of Nicholas and his successor, Thomas Smith.\r\nThe Navy Commissioners had no secretary, and until September 1653 each\r\nCommissioner was allowed only one clerk, at £30 a year—scanty assistance,\r\nconsidering the amount of work thrown into their hands. From September\r\nthe number was doubled, and two purveyors were appointed to assist them\r\nin purchasing stores. The total annual cost of the Admiralty, the Navy\r\nOffice, and the chief officers of the four dockyards was £11,179, 9s\r\n10d.[1393]\r\n\r\nIf we may trust a later writer, the sums spent on the Navy Office, which\r\nbore only a trifling proportion to the naval expenses, sometimes reaching\r\na million and a quarter, were not misapplied. Henry Maydman, who was a\r\npurser under the Commonwealth, and Mayor of Portsmouth in 1710, wrote\r\nlong afterwards:—\r\n\r\n    In all the wars we had in the time of King Charles’s exile the\r\n    Navy Office was so ordered that a man might have despatched\r\n    any affair almost at one board ... and with the greatest ease\r\n    imaginable, and cheapness too. For their public business was\r\n    carried on with all imaginable application, and it was a crime\r\n    for any one to absent himself from his post.[1394]\r\n\r\nSo far as the intentions and efforts of the Navy Commissioners were\r\nconcerned this was doubtless true, but it is to be feared that the\r\nState Papers do not support the implication that money matters were\r\nsettled with the same ease as those relating to the routine of daily\r\nmanagement, although that, of course, was an imperfection for which they\r\nwere not accountable, and over which they had no control. To the full\r\nextent of their power they watched not only over the public interests,\r\nbut also over those of the men who, for the first time, seem to have\r\nlooked up to officials of their position as friends and helpers. Some of\r\nthe appeals they listened to are embodied in a letter to the Admiralty\r\nCommittee.[1395]\r\n\r\n    We have complaints daily made unto us by poor seamen pressed\r\n    out of merchant ships into the state’s service that they are\r\n    grossly abused by their masters and owners in pretending\r\n    leakage, damage, or not delivery of their goods, whereby they\r\n    keep their pay from them, meanly taking advantage of the poor\r\n    men’s forcing away by the state’s press masters and not having\r\n    time to get their rights, are by this means defrauded of their\r\n    wages. We look upon it as a very great oppression and have\r\n    therefore thought good to acquaint your honours therewith.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards they had to write on behalf of merchants who had\r\ntrusted them[1396]:—\r\n\r\n    It is not pleasing to us to fill your ears with complaints, yet\r\n    we judge it our duty, while entrusted with so great a share of\r\n    the naval affairs, to again remind you of the emptiness of all\r\n    the stores.... We have not been wanting in obtaining supplies\r\n    by means of fair promises, and now we are hardly thought and\r\n    spoken of by those who cannot obtain their money.\r\n\r\nIn one instance the ‘fair promises’ resolved themselves into a bill for\r\n£400 on account, which, said the recipient, ‘has hitherto done me no more\r\ngood than an old almanac.’ It has been remarked that the position of\r\nall who were in the service of the state became more difficult as time\r\npassed, and money became scarcer and scarcer towards 1660. When, in 1658,\r\nthe Navy Commissioners were obliged to pay—or promise—prices from 30 to\r\n50 per cent. above the market standard, it may be supposed that their\r\nsituation had its own discomforts.[1397] Besides guarding the material\r\ninterests, they had to review the moral conduct, of their subordinates,\r\nand they were evidently shocked to be compelled to report to the\r\nAdmiralty Commissioners that captain Phineas Pett, clerk of the check at\r\nChatham, was the father of an illegitimate child. On another occasion\r\nWilloughby was inquiring whether a boatswain possessed two wives.\r\n\r\nAfter the resignation of Richard Cromwell Parliament interposed more\r\ndirectly in naval affairs, and the Commissioners exercised less\r\nauthority; on one occasion the agent at Chester, who went on board a\r\nman-of-war to muster the men, was refused an opportunity to perform his\r\nduty, and told, in answer to his threats, that ‘the power of the Navy\r\nCommissioners was not as formerly.’ A fact so plainly put must have been\r\ngenerally recognised, and accounts for the comparative disappearance of\r\nthe Commissioners from the papers of the last year of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Administration:—The Navy Treasurer.]\r\n\r\nFrom 1st January 1651, Richard Hutchinson replaced Vane as Treasurer of\r\nthe Navy under circumstances noticed on a previous page. He began with\r\na salary of £1000 a year, in lieu of all former fees and perquisites,\r\nand the appearance of his name in the State Papers is almost invariably\r\nassociated with requests for higher pay, or melancholy wails about the\r\namount of work thrown upon him by the wars in which we were engaged.\r\nFor 1653 he was allowed an extra £1000;[1398] not satisfied with this\r\nhe petitioned again in December, and so successfully that, by an order\r\nof the Council, he was to be given, in 1654, £2500, and a further £1000\r\nfor every £100,000 disbursed in excess of £1,300,000.[1399] That this\r\nman, who was merely a glorified clerk, who was never required to act on\r\nhis own initiative, and whose work demanded neither energy, foresight,\r\nnor talent, should have received over £2500 a year, while the Navy\r\nCommissioners, to whose organising genius was mainly due the rapid and\r\ncomplete equipment which enabled the English fleets to be of sufficient\r\nstrength at the point of contact, were rewarded with £250 a year, and a\r\ngratuity of £150 for one twelvemonth, is one of those incidents which\r\ninterest the impartial student of forms of government. From January 1655\r\nhis pay was fixed at £1500 a year, with £100 commission on every £100,000\r\nissued above £700,000; a year later he tried to get this commission\r\ndoubled, and to have it allowed on his first three years of office, ‘I\r\nhaving much larger promises at the time.’[1400] A remark like this, the\r\nease with which he obtained his almost annual increments, and the fact\r\nthat he was appointed in spite of Vane’s opposition, taken together, lead\r\none to suspect that he must have had some potent influence behind him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Commonwealth Captains.]\r\n\r\nAmong officers, captains were the class who gave most trouble throughout\r\nthese years, the number tried for, or accused of, various delinquencies\r\nyielding a much higher percentage of the total employed than that\r\nafforded by the men, or by officers of any other rank. This was, perhaps,\r\nlargely due to the rapid promotion necessitated by the sudden increase\r\nof the Navy, commanders being chosen mainly for professional capacity,\r\nand, if considered politically safe, few questions were asked about\r\ntheir religious or moral qualifications. Many, again, had risen from the\r\nforecastle, and possibly brought with them reminiscences of the habits\r\nexisting in the Caroline Navy: others had been privateer captains, an\r\noccupation which did not tend to make their moral sense more delicate.\r\nProfessional honour was not yet a living force, and, in some orders\r\nissued by Monk to the captains of a detached squadron, the threat of loss\r\nof wages as a punishment for disobedience came after, and was obviously\r\nintended as a more impressive deterrent than, the disgrace of being\r\ncashiered.[1401]\r\n\r\nWith one offence, however—cowardice—very few were charged; after 1642\r\nfew men wanting physical courage were likely to force their way to the\r\nfront. George Wager, who chose to blow up the _Greyhound_ rather than\r\nstrike the English flag, had been a boatswain; Amos Bear, a boatswain’s\r\nboy; Robert Clay, a carpenter; Heaton, a trumpeter’s mate; Badiley,\r\nSansum, and Goodson, cabin boys; and doubtless close inquiry would\r\nreveal many more examples. Four days before the execution of Charles the\r\nNavy Commissioners wrote to Portsmouth, and presumably to other naval\r\nstations, ‘to entreat’ those in charge to take care that all officers\r\nappointed were well affected to the Parliament, and authorising them\r\nto suspend any suspected ones on their own responsibility.[1402] But\r\nthe government was not unforgiving; two of Rupert’s captains, Goulden\r\nand Marshall, commanded state’s ships,[1403] and officers who had\r\ndeserted in the mutiny of 1648 were received back into the service of\r\nthe Commonwealth. The following list, in all probability by no means\r\ncomplete, will show the large number of captains whose conduct came under\r\nobservation, and the character of their misdemeanours:—\r\n\r\n  +---------------+------------------------------+------------------------+\r\n  |      Name     |          Accused of          |        Result          |\r\n  +---------------+------------------------------+------------------------+\r\n  |John Taylor   }|                              |{ Ordered to enter into |\r\n  |Anth.

In cases of embezzlement the sentence of a\r\ncourt-martial, where ascertainable, appears to have been usually confined\r\nto fining the accused the value of the stores stolen, or stopping the\r\namount from his wages. The custom was commencing of trying commanders,\r\nwho lost their ships by misadventure, before a court-martial, instead\r\nof accepting their explanations, or holding an informal investigation\r\nat Whitehall, as had previously been done; and once a captain was sent\r\nbefore a court because his ship went ashore, although she came off\r\nwithout damage.[1414] This must be almost the first occurrence of that\r\nform of inquiry. Log books were now compulsory, and were sent up to the\r\nNavy Commissioners on the return of the ship; by an order of 2nd Feb.\r\n1653 an advocate, who conducted prosecutions in courts-martial, was\r\nattached to the fleets. It will be noticed how often drunkenness is an\r\narticle in the foregoing charges, and this weakness seems to have been\r\ncommon in all ranks, from captains down to ships’ boys. Among these\r\nnaval papers there are very few indications of the existence of Puritan\r\nfervour or even of ordinary religious feeling; the great mass of men\r\nand officers aimed at pay and prize money, gave strenuous service when\r\nthe former was punctual and the latter plentiful, and became heedless\r\nand indifferent when they failed. Sailors have been always much more\r\ninterested in their material prosperity in this world than the prospects\r\nof their future welfare in the next. Nor does the rule of the saints\r\nappear to have spiritualised the proverbial hard swearing of the service.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Inception of Class Feeling.]\r\n\r\nIt is, however, from this period that dates that sense of solidarity\r\namong officers and men which is at once the sign and consequence of an\r\norganised and continuous service. Hitherto the permanent executive force\r\nin peace time had consisted of a few subordinate officers and some 200\r\nor 300 shipkeepers, many of whom were not even seamen. When a fleet was\r\nprepared, the ships were commanded by captains for whom sea service was\r\nonly an episode, and officered and manned by men who came from, and were\r\nimmediately sent back to, the merchant service on the completion of their\r\ncruise. But between 1642 and 1660 every available English sailor must\r\nhave passed a large portion of those years on the state’s ships; and the\r\ncaptains and officers were kept in nearly continuous employment, with the\r\nresult of the formation of a class feeling, and the growth of especial\r\nmanners and habits, characteristic of men working under conditions which\r\nremoved them from frequent contact with their fellows. The numerous\r\nnotices in Restoration literature of the particular appearance, modes of\r\nexpression, and bearing, stamping the man-of-war officer—references never\r\nbefore made—show how rapidly the new circumstances had produced their\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The other Officers.]\r\n\r\nWhen captains showed themselves so ready to steal it might have been\r\nexpected that officers of lower rank would follow, and even improve upon,\r\nthe pattern set them, but this did not prove to be the case. Although, of\r\ncourse, there are many flagrant cases recorded, the number of officers\r\ncharged with fraud or theft is not only relatively less, considering\r\nthe much larger aggregate employed, than under Charles I, but also\r\nabsolutely smaller for any equal series of years. Experience, gained\r\nduring the civil war, had led to closer inspection and the introduction\r\nof safeguards which made theft neither so easy nor so free from risk,\r\nand further precautions were taken under the Commonwealth. Embezzlement\r\nby a captain could not be prevented, it could only be punished: but\r\nthe regulations which made it easy for him might make it difficult for\r\nhis gunner or boatswain. The first step, taken in 1649, was to raise\r\nthe wages of those officers who were in charge of stores, a measure\r\nrecommended long before by Holland and every other reformer. In 1651\r\nthe Navy Commissioners were directed to consider how the frauds, still\r\nnumerous among officers, might be best dealt with, and this was probably\r\nthe cause of an order the next year that sureties should be required\r\nfrom pursers, boatswains, and others for the honest performance of their\r\nduties.[1415] These sureties were usually entered into by two persons,\r\nand were sometimes as high as £600.\r\n\r\nThat some such method was necessary, at least with the pursers, is\r\nevident from the following catalogue of their ‘chief’ abuses, drawn up\r\nby the Navy Commissioners in 1651:[1416] (1) They forge their captains’\r\nsignatures; (2) make false entries of men; (3) falsify the time men have\r\nserved; (4) sign receipts for a full delivery of stores and compound with\r\nthe victualling agents for the portion not received; (5) do not send in\r\ntheir accounts for one voyage till they are again sailing; (6) charge\r\nthe men with clothes not sold to them; and (7) execute their places by\r\ndeputy while they stop on shore. The principal reforms suggested by the\r\nCommissioners were that bonds should be required, that stewards should\r\nbe employed for the victualling, that pursers should in future sail as\r\nclerks of the check, with limited powers, and that all their papers\r\nshould be countersigned by the captain. These measures were all adopted,\r\nbut a further recommendation that a pillory should be erected near the\r\nNavy Office for their especial use was not, apparently, acted upon. When\r\none purser openly declared that he cared not how the seamen starved if\r\nhe could ‘make £500 or £600 a year out of their bellies,’ it was full\r\ntime to apply to his kind the treatment exercised by governments on such\r\ndangerous idealists as constitutional reformers.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners had set themselves a hard task in the inculcation of\r\nhonesty, for that sentiment which still regards lightly cheats on a\r\ngovernment was strongly against them. When Dover was searched, in 1653,\r\nlarge quantities of stolen cordage, sold from the ships, were discovered,\r\nand Bourne found that ‘these embezzlements are so common that the people\r\ndeclare that they think it no wrong to the state.’ Still in the long\r\nrun they were more successful than their predecessors had been, and the\r\ntrials for embezzlement became fewer after 1653. Their treatment of the\r\npursers had the best results, judging from the small number of those\r\nofficers who came up for judgment; these gentlemen did not at all like\r\nthe new rules and at first mostly refused to sail as clerks of the check.\r\nFor reasons unknown, unless it was that they had become more trustworthy\r\nand that the new system was in some respects cumbrous, the clerks\r\nwere abolished in 1655 and the pursers reinstated in their old powers,\r\npecuniary guarantees in the shape of the bonds still being required\r\nfrom them.[1417] It must have been a very new and unpleasant experience\r\nto some of these men, who many of them remembered the free hand they\r\nwere allowed before 1640, to find themselves before a court-martial for\r\nacts they had come to look upon as natural to their places. One steward\r\nattempted to evade an accusation of embezzlement by declaring that the\r\nrats had eaten his books; he might have improved his defence by producing\r\nsome of the victuallers’ ‘salt horse,’ and showing that his books, being\r\ntenderer and more nutritious, were more likely to tempt the rats. In\r\nthe trial of another we have some account of the mode of proceeding.\r\nThe prisoner, Joshua Hunt, was tried under the twenty-eighth article of\r\nwar before Lawson and twelve commanding officers, and was himself sworn\r\nand examined. By the twenty-eighth article the character of the penalty\r\nis left to the decision of the court, and Hunt was given the option of\r\nmaking restitution or of undergoing punishment. In making his report,\r\nMonk remarked that the prisoner had only been found out in that which\r\nmost stewards did, and that he would be sent up to London to give his\r\nfriends or sureties the opportunity of making amends; if they failed to\r\ndo this he was to be returned to the fleet for corporal punishment at the\r\ndecision of a further court-martial.[1418] This form of sentence was very\r\nfrequent, and gunners, boatswains, and stewards were ordinarily fined the\r\nvalue of the stores stolen, and committed to prison until it was paid.\r\n\r\nThe wide discretion left to the courts-martial led to great inequality\r\nin the sentences, especially when an example could be made without\r\nlosing the stores or their money value. A carpenter was tried for theft;\r\nhe confessed to the intention, and partly to the act, but returned the\r\narticles before arrest. He was, however, ordered to be taken from ship\r\nto ship in the Downs, with a paper describing his offence affixed to his\r\nbreast, the paper being read at each ship’s side, to be thrice ducked\r\nfrom the yardarm, and to be cashiered. Obviously it was more profitable\r\nand less dangerous not to stop halfway in theft. In 1653 is found a\r\nrather remarkable sentence: Wm. Haycock, carpenter’s mate of the _Hound_,\r\nwas, for ‘drunkenness, swearing, and uncleanness,’ ordered, among other\r\nthings, ten lashes at the side of _each_ flagship. Haycock has the\r\ndistinction of being the first recorded victim of the form of punishment\r\nwhich afterwards developed into the devilish torture known as ‘flogging\r\nround the fleet.’ It became comparatively common during the reign of\r\nCharles II.\r\n\r\nAt Chatham, in 1655 the authorities appear to have discovered and broken\r\nup a gang of receivers, of whom one had an estate of £5000 obtained\r\nfrom thefts from the ships and yards. A hoyman, Dunning, confessed to\r\nhaving conveyed 500 barrels of powder from the men-of-war at Chatham and\r\nDeptford within four years. When pressed for particulars, he exclaimed,\r\n‘Alas! shall I undo a thousand families? Shall I undo so many? I did\r\nnot think you would put me upon it to do so!’ Finding that this appeal,\r\ninstead of silencing, only whetted his examiners’ curiosity, he had\r\nat last to name eighteen ships whose gunners had given him powder to\r\nremove.[1419] The Admiralty employed detectives of their own to find\r\nout thefts, but on more than one occasion these men turned thieves\r\nthemselves. The aforesaid Dunning bought a cable from one of them;\r\nanother was found ‘to have unduly abused his trust,’ but a third was\r\ngranted £15 for proving the larcenies of captain Cadman. Sometimes,\r\nwhen the amount was small, the Admiralty, instead of bringing offenders\r\nto trial, deducted the estimated value of their embezzlements from\r\nwages;[1420] evidently punishment was very uncertain in extent, but the\r\npractical impunity of former times could no longer be reckoned on.\r\n\r\nIn some few instances the Admiralty had to deal with difficulties of\r\nanother nature among the officers. Richard Knowlman, a gunner, and\r\ndescribed as a Quaker, wrote to the Commissioners that he had served by\r\nsea and land from 1641, and was still willing to continue in any other\r\ncapacity, since ‘I would be free to act against all deceit ... for I see\r\nmost men, especially those in the navy and of most rank and quality,\r\nare corrupted.’ Knowlman could not have expressed less respect for the\r\naverage official had he enjoyed access to the State Papers, but on the\r\nwhole his was one of the very rare eras when such doubts were unjust.\r\nAnother master gunner had, for two months, refused to fire a gun, ‘lest\r\nblood might be spilt,’ and a third insisted on preaching to the crew of\r\nthe _Fame_, who by no means appreciated his amateur ministrations. In\r\nthree instances chaplains are found accused of drunkenness, but their\r\npresence on board ship was not invariable, and their influence appears to\r\nhave been very slight. One was tried for forging Monk’s signature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Commissioners’ Success.]\r\n\r\nThe habits of half a century were not to be at once overthrown, but after\r\n1655 references to thefts became far fewer; and the Navy Commissioners\r\ncould congratulate themselves on having done much to extinguish customs\r\nwhich had gone far to destroy the vitality of the former Royal Navy.\r\nThe want of trust, that long experience had shown to be justifiable\r\nin gunners, carpenters, and boatswains, who had been, and were still\r\nto a certain extent, treated as officers, may have been one reason\r\nwhy lieutenants were now always attached to ships, except fifth- and\r\nsixth-rates. Another may probably be found in the growing demand for\r\nscientific seamanship, an accomplishment the former class had little\r\nopportunity of acquiring. Whatever the cause, the effect was to thrust\r\nthe gunners and their compeers lower down in the social scale, to lose\r\nthem that respect on shipboard they had hitherto possessed, to lessen\r\ntheir authority, and so quicken the downward movement. We are told that,\r\na generation later, it was as usual to strike them as to strike the men,\r\nand that they had to ‘fawn like spaniels’ on the lieutenants to retain\r\nfavour or position. The lieutenants must have been found much more\r\nsatisfactory; in the whole series of papers relating to this period there\r\nis no instance of one being tried by court-martial, and only one in which\r\nsuch an officer got into any trouble. His captain put him in irons, but\r\nthe reason is not given. Lieutenants were occasionally appointed to the\r\nnaval service in the reign of Elizabeth, but the Dutch war may be taken\r\nas the period where their position became permanent. In June 1652, Sir\r\nWm. Penn, then vice-admiral, writing to Cromwell, gave expression to the\r\nunanimous desire of his colleagues that such a rank should be allowed in\r\nall ships carrying 150 men.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty the Commissioners had to contend with was the\r\nforging of seamen’s tickets, an old form of crime which grew in extent\r\nwith the employment of so many more men. The Navy Commissioners, in\r\nadvance of their time, recognised that the only legal penalty, death,\r\nwas too severe, and practically prevented any punishment.[1421] The\r\nNavy department was not the only one which suffered from these forgers,\r\nwho were all more or less connected with each other; in the same\r\nyear forgeries of public faith bills to the amount of £115,000 were\r\ndiscovered. Some of these men were in league with clerks in the Navy\r\nand prize offices, and obtained the necessary papers and information\r\nfrom them. At a later date one of the gang confessed, when in prison,\r\nthat the total of the public faith bill and other forgeries was nearly\r\n£500,000.[1422] In 1656 a new plan was tried: ‘to prevent the many frauds\r\nand deceits formerly practised,’ the Commissioners were ordered to send\r\nthe Treasurer, daily or weekly, an abstract of all the bills or tickets\r\nthey signed authorising payment of money. Subsequently the Admiralty\r\nCommissioners obtained power to themselves commit offenders to prison.\r\nNicholas Harnaman, for instance, was sent to Bridewell with hard labour\r\n’till further order,’ for counterfeiting tickets.[1423]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Officers’ Pay.]\r\n\r\nOfficers’ pay was raised in March 1649, and again in 1653, after which\r\nlatter date there was no alteration.[1424] It then stood per month at:—\r\n\r\n  +-----------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n  |                 |1st Rate|2nd Rate|3rd Rate|4th Rate|5th Rate|6th Rate|\r\n  +-----------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n  |                 | £  s d | £  s d | £  s d | £  s d | £  s d | £  s d |\r\n  |Captain          |21  0 0 |16 16 0 |14  0 0 |10  0 0 | 8  8 0 | 7  0 0 |\r\n  |Lieutenant       | 4  4 0 | 4  4 0 | 3 10 0 | 3 10 0 |        |        |\r\n  |Master           | 7  0 0 | 6  6 0 | 4 13 8 | 4  6 2 | 3  7 6 | [1425] |\r\n  |Master’s mate or |        |        |        |        |        |        |\r\n  |  pilot          | 3  6 0 | 3  0 0 | 2 16 2 | 2 7 10 | 2  2 0 | 2  2 0 |\r\n  |Midshipman       | 2  5 0 | 2  0 0 | 1 17 6 | 1 13 9 | 1 10 0 | 1 10 0 |\r\n  |Boatswain        | 4  0 0 | 3 10 0 | 3  0 0 | 2 10 0 | 2  5 0 | 2  0 0 |\r\n  |Boatswain’s mate | 1 15 0 | 1 15 0 | 1 12 0 | 1 10 0 | 1  8 0 | 1  6 0 |\r\n  |Quartermaster    | 1 15 0 | 1 15 0 | 1 12 0 | 1 10 0 | 1  8 0 | 1  6 0 |\r\n  |Quartermaster’s  |        |        |        |        |        |        |\r\n  |  mate           | 1 10 0 | 0 10 0 | 1  8 0 | 1  8 0 | 1  6 0 | 1  5 0 |\r\n  |Carpenter        | 4  0 0 | 3 10 0 | 3  0 0 | 2 10 0 | 2  5 0 | 2  0 0 |\r\n  |Carpenter’s mate | 2  0 0 | 2  0 0 | 1 16 0 | 1 14 0 | 1 12 0 | 1 10 0 |\r\n  |Gunner           | 4  0 0 | 3  1 0 | 3  0 0 | 2 10 0 | 2  5 0 | 2  0 0 |\r\n  |Gunner’s mate    | 1 15 0 | 1 15 0 | 1 12 0 | 1 10 0 | 1  8 0 | 1  6 0 |\r\n  |Surgeon          | 2 10 0 | 2 10 0 | 2 10 0 | 2 10 0 | 2 10 0 | 2 10 0 |\r\n  |Corporal         | 1 15 0 | 1 12 0 | 1 10 0 | 1 10 0 | 1  8 0 | 1  5 0 |\r\n  |Purser           | 4  0 0 | 3 10 0 | 3  0 0 | 2 10 0 | 2  5 0 | 2  0 0 |\r\n  |Master           |        |        |        |        |        |        |\r\n  |  Trumpeter[1426]| 1 10 0 | 1  8 0 | 1  5 0 | 1  5 0 | 1  5 0 | 1  4 0 |\r\n  |Cook             | 1  5 0 | 1  5 0 | 1  5 0 | 1  5 0 | 1  5 0 | 1  4 0 |\r\n  +-----------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Guns and Ordnance Stores.]\r\n\r\nWhen Parliament began the rapid construction of new ships some of its\r\nmembers may have had misgivings about getting the crews to man them,\r\nbut few probably anticipated the future difficulties in procuring the\r\nguns wherewith to arm them. Geo. Browne, for so many years the royal\r\ngunfounder, was still almost the only maker, and his works were unequal\r\nto the increased demands.[1427] In March and April 1652, when war\r\nappeared certain, 335 guns were immediately required to equip only part\r\nof the Navy,[1428] but the authorities were already reduced to such\r\nstraits as to be compelled to send searchers about London to try to\r\nfind ordnance.[1429] A month later some of the inland strongholds were\r\ndisarmed, and 84 brass and 544 iron guns thus obtained; the sale of\r\nordnance taken in prizes was strictly prohibited, and, in the course of\r\nthe year, guns were hired at ten and twelve shillings each a month. In\r\nDecember the ordnance officials announced that 1500 iron pieces, weighing\r\n2230 tons, at £26 a ton, were required, the same number of carriages\r\nat from 21s to 31s 3d each, 117,000 round and double-headed shot, 5000\r\nhand grenades at 2s 6d each, 12,000 barrels of corn powder at £4 10s a\r\nbarrel, and 150 tons of breechings and tackle at £50 a ton.[1430] To meet\r\nthese wants they had in store only 121 guns and 34,000 rounds.[1431] In\r\nFebruary 1653 the contracts were made for these guns, but, very soon\r\nafter they were entered into, the officials saw that the deliveries would\r\nbe at ‘a vast distance from our pressing occasions,’ for not only was\r\nthe Tower empty but the ports were also destitute of munition, and, at\r\nPortsmouth, they were in April ‘at a stand’ for powder and shot.\r\n\r\nAll that Browne and Foley could promise was to deliver 140 guns in\r\nOctober, 190 in February 1654, 254 in June, 230 in October, and 86 in\r\nJune 1655; but, as 500 were still to be sent in on old contracts, their\r\nengagements could hardly be relied on. Fifty tons of shot and 5000 hand\r\ngrenades they promised for June, 50 tons in September, and 100 more by\r\nMarch 1654. In the meantime ships intended to serve as armed merchantmen\r\nwere actually waiting uselessly for 117 guns, which the Ordnance\r\ndepartment could not procure anywhere.[1432] The immediate outlook for\r\npowder was no better, since there was instant demand for 2780 barrels and\r\nonly 500 in store, while the contractors were only bound to supply 660\r\nbarrels a month. Here, however, the further prospect was more favourable,\r\nas there were many powder-makers at work and the government could\r\npurchase quantities at Hamburg.\r\n\r\nThe staff of the Ordnance office was very much larger, proportionately,\r\nthan that of the Admiralty. It employed, at yearly salaries, a surveyor,\r\n£194; clerk, £215; storekeeper, £216; clerk of the delivery, £166;\r\nmaster gunner of England, £121; keeper of the small gun office, £66;\r\nmessenger, £60; two furbishers, £12 each; and twenty labourers at £21\r\neach.[1433] Its management had mended considerably since 1640, but the\r\nimprovement did not avail to save its independence in 1653 when it became\r\na department of the Admiralty. In February 1654 matters were so far\r\nbetter that there were 2359 barrels of powder and 38,000 round and other\r\nshot in hand, but still no guns in reserve. There are no complaints about\r\nthe quality of the powder supplied during the Dutch war, but, in 1655 and\r\n1656, accusations against the makers, who were said to ‘use some sleight\r\nto make it Tower-proof on delivery, but it does not long continue good\r\nnor abide change of weather,’ became numerous. All that the authorities\r\ncould do was to call upon the manufacturers to make it good, or, if they\r\npreferred, take it back with a licence to export it abroad; 6827 out of\r\n15,098 barrels recently furnished were defective, and, by an order of 2nd\r\nApril 1656, the Council gave the contractors the choice between these\r\ncourses and being committed to prison. The makers, however, had something\r\nto say on their side. Like most other naval purveyors they had not been\r\npaid, and even to get any money on account were sometimes compelled,\r\nunder threats of still longer postponement, to repair Hamburg powder at\r\n17s a barrel when the real price should have been £2, naturally with\r\nunsatisfactory results. Some attributed all the mischief to the Hamburg\r\nimportations, but most of them seem to have gone into the business\r\nwithout any expert knowledge, simply with a view of profiting by the\r\nsudden demand for war material.[1434]\r\n\r\nThe form of reparation exacted was manifestly unfair: instead of each\r\nmaker being required to substitute good for whatever bad powder he had\r\nsent in they were called upon to replace it in proportion to their\r\ncontracts. Thus Josias Devey was made liable for 461 barrels instead of\r\nthe 141 which were faulty in the number he had supplied, and apparently\r\nhe would have fared just as badly if his powder had been excellent down\r\nto the last pound.[1435] As some of the manufacturers had delivered 50\r\nper cent., or more, of inferior quality, the probable explanation of\r\nthis not very honourable proceeding is to be found in the fear of the\r\nCouncil that the worst culprits would be pecuniarily unable to make\r\namends if assessed at their full liability. Wapping seems to have been a\r\nmanufacturing district, since, in July 1657, there was an explosion of\r\npowder mills, or stores, there which injured many people and damaged 846\r\nhouses to the extent of £10,000.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Dockyards.]\r\n\r\nThe enlargements and improvements of the dockyards were not as\r\nconsiderable as might have been expected in view of the increased\r\nnumber of ships, and the space required for their accommodation. These\r\nrequirements were partly met by the greater use made of Plymouth, and\r\nmaking Dover and Harwich stations where ships might obtain provisions\r\nand minor repairs. Harwich, largely used for a few years in the middle\r\nof the sixteenth century, had been found of some service during the\r\ncivil war, but the movements of the fleets in the North Sea, and off\r\nthe coast of Holland, brought both it and Dover into prominence. The\r\nlatter port was not utilised till 1653, and was never very freely used,\r\nalthough the quarterly accounts sometimes reached £700 or £800; both it\r\nand Portsmouth were supplied with stores from Deptford. Bourne, from\r\nthe date of his appointment as Navy Commissioner, took up his residence\r\nat Harwich, and remained there till March 1658. Monk’s testimony to his\r\nability and success has already been quoted, although he had none of the\r\nappliances available in the older yards. But in 1657 ground was rented\r\nfrom the corporation, for a permanent government yard and wharf, on a\r\nninety-nine year lease at £5 a year.[1436] Plymouth was employed mainly\r\nfor victualling the ships on the western Channel station, as Dover was\r\nfor those eastwards, and, to a certain extent, for repairs, although\r\nits exposed roadstead was no favourite with captains whose vessels were\r\nfit to put to sea. Blake evidently did not like it; ‘the unsafeness and\r\nhazard of this road, which to us is worse than a prison, is enough to\r\nscare us hence.’\r\n\r\nOne way of gauging the relative importance of the dockyards is to compare\r\nthe stores in hand at a given date. We are enabled to do this for\r\nFebruary and June 1659, as follows:—[1437]\r\n\r\n  +----------------------+-----------+----------+-----------------+\r\n  |                      |  Chatham  | Woolwich |    Deptford     |\r\n  +----------------------+-----------+----------+-----------------+\r\n  | Anchors              |    108    |          |     129         |\r\n  | Masts                |    356    |      724 |     269         |\r\n  | Cables               |    106    |       29 |     272         |\r\n  | Loads of timber[1438]|   1500    |      322 |     416         |\r\n  | Tree-nails           | 80,000    |  122,000 |  93,000         |\r\n  | Compasses            |           |      180 |     144[1440]   |\r\n  | Hemp                 | 100 tons  |  75 tons |                 |\r\n  | Noyals canvas        |           |          | 23,000 yds.     |\r\n  | Vittery  ”           | 1800 ells |          | 25,000 ells     |\r\n  | Ipswich  ”           |           |          | 272 bolts[1441] |\r\n  | English  ”           | 240 bolts |          |                 |\r\n  | Tar and pitch        |  30 lasts |          |                 |\r\n  | Hammocks             |     900   |     1200 |      700        |\r\n  +----------------------+-----------+----------+-----------------+\r\n\r\n  +----------------------+-------------+------------+-----------+\r\n  |                      | Portsmouth  |  Plymouth  |  Harwich  |\r\n  +----------------------+-------------+------------+-----------+\r\n  | Anchors              |      62     |     17     |   13      |\r\n  | Masts                |     498     |     95     |   67      |\r\n  | Cables               |      70     |     42     |   63      |\r\n  | Loads of timber[1438]|     508     |   [1439]   |   79      |\r\n  | Tree-nails           |             |   2000     |           |\r\n  | Compasses            |             |            |           |\r\n  | Hemp                 | 63½ tons    |            |           |\r\n  | Noyals canvas        | 10,600 yds. |  2000 yds. | 4850 yds. |\r\n  | Vittery  ”           |             |            |  380 ells |\r\n  | Ipswich  ”           |             |            | 5½ bolts  |\r\n  | English  ”           |  7650 yds.  | 370 yds.   |           |\r\n  | Tar and pitch        | 99 barrels  | 95 barrels |           |\r\n  | Hammocks             |     2020    |            |           |\r\n  +----------------------+-------------+------------+-----------+\r\n\r\nOwing to want of money the magazines were very low at this date, but the\r\nrelation shown here would doubtless always exist. Harwich and Plymouth\r\ncan refit ships which have suffered in spars, fittings, or canvas;\r\nChatham, Woolwich, and Deptford build or repair, while Portsmouth is\r\nequipped for all purposes. Hitherto all masts had been obtained from the\r\nBaltic, but in 1652 the government tried the experiment of sending two\r\nvessels to New England for them, and the results were so satisfactory\r\nthat henceforth a proportion of masts from the colonies is found in all\r\nthe lists of dockyard stores. The English canvas is elsewhere described\r\nas west country canvas, and was principally made in Somersetshire;\r\nits manufacture was due to Geo. Pley, afterwards government agent at\r\nWeymouth and governor of Portland, who successfully urged its use upon\r\nthe Admiralty. It cost 1s 7d or 1s 8d a yard, and was dearer than French\r\ncanvas, but considered better.[1442]\r\n\r\nIn 1653 there was a double dry dock at Chatham, Woolwich, and Deptford\r\nrespectively,[1443] and one at Blackwall, probably in the East India\r\nCompany’s yard; these were the only docks directly belonging to, or\r\navailable by, the state. No addition appears to have been made to Chatham\r\nyard except the purchase of a wharf and storehouse adjoining the old\r\ndock in 1656.[1444] In October 1653 a contractor from Chatham was either\r\nrepairing an old, or constructing a new, dock at Deptford;[1445] and\r\nin 1657 some wharves were built there along the waterside.[1446] A new\r\ndry dock was ordered for Woolwich in 1653[1447] and completed the next\r\nyear;[1448] storehouses were built in 1656;[1449] and two years later\r\na lease was taken from John Rymill, butcher, of London, of one acre of\r\nland, known as Chimney Marsh, on the east side of Ham Creek, ‘next to\r\nthe state’s yard,’ for ten years, at £4 a year.[1450] The sizes of the\r\nyards may, perhaps, be inferred from the number of watchmen attached to\r\neach—Chatham, 32; Deptford, 18; Woolwich, 16; and Portsmouth, 13.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dockyards:—Portsmouth.]\r\n\r\nPortsmouth, if the smallest of the chief yards, became under the\r\nCommonwealth one of the busiest and most important. In June 1649 one\r\nof five new frigates was ordered to be laid down there; this vessel,\r\nthe _Portsmouth_, was duly launched in 1650, and, with the doubtful\r\nexception of the _Jennett_, in ‘new making’ at Portsmouth in 1559, was\r\nthe first man-of-war of the modern Royal Navy built at that place since\r\nthe _Mary Rose_ and _Peter Pomegranate_ of 1509 were first floated in\r\nthe harbour.[1451] The dry dock so often recommended and ordered under\r\nCharles I was, however, not yet existent. It was urged that one-third\r\nof the Navy ought to be permanently stationed at the port, but in 1652\r\nthe Commissioner in charge complained that there was not room for the\r\nstores required for the few ships usually there. From a survey of 1653\r\nwe obtain, so far as names go, a statement of the number of buildings in\r\nthe dockyard; they are upper and lower storehouses, upper and lower hemp\r\nhouses, block loft, old rope-maker’s house, office and nail loft, canvas\r\nroom, hammock room, kettle room, iron loft, tar house, oil house, sail\r\nloft, and top-makers’ and boat-makers’ house.[1452]\r\n\r\nLess than twenty years earlier Russell had found that work done at\r\nPortsmouth was 100 per cent. dearer than at the other yards, but\r\nWilloughby had altered that, and now boasted that he could build 20\r\nper cent. cheaper than elsewhere, although all the skilled artisans\r\nrequired in naval work had to be sent down, there seeming to be as yet\r\nno population attached to or living on the dockyard. He desired that\r\nfive and a half acres of adjoining ground should be purchased, a rope\r\nyard erected, and the whole yard surrounded by a brick wall 73 perches\r\nin length.[1453] Therefore in 1653 and 1654 the Navy Commissioners were\r\ndirected to take a lease of an acre and a half of the ground recommended,\r\nto set up a rope-yard, and to build the wall.[1454] In December 1655\r\nWilloughby put before the Commissioners the difficulty in carrying on the\r\nordinary work, ‘we wanting the benefit of a dock,’ and at this time the\r\nstaff, recently reduced in strength, numbered 180 men. In the following\r\nApril Bourne and captain John Taylor, a shipwright of Chatham, were sent\r\ndown to consult with Willoughby as to the best position for a dry dock\r\nwhich was to be ‘forthwith made.’[1455] On their report an order issued\r\nin August that one of sufficient capacity to take third-rates was to\r\noccupy the situation of the existing graving dock, and that it was not\r\nto cost more than £3200, of which the town, presumably in the hope of\r\nattracting trade and inhabitants, was willing to contribute £500.[1456]\r\nIn November Taylor was instructed to go to Portsmouth and superintend its\r\nconstruction, but he energetically protested that he knew nothing about\r\ndock-building and would, under such circumstances, only make himself\r\nridiculous. It was therefore put in the hands of Nicholas Poirson, who\r\nsigned the contract on 24th November, by which he undertook to complete\r\nit by the following 20th July, for £2100, the government providing the\r\nmaterials and the corporation £500 of this sum.[1457]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shipwrights and Workmen.]\r\n\r\nThere were still a sufficient number of abuses in connection with the\r\ndockyards, but the flagrant thefts customary under Charles I had been\r\nlargely diminished. Members of the Pett family occupied responsible\r\npositions in the three home yards, and either they used their power to\r\nill purpose, or their favour with the authorities was no passport to\r\nthe love of their subordinates. In 1651 there was what would now be\r\nadvertised as a great scandal at Chatham; all the chief officers, and\r\nmany of the workmen, were accusing each other of misdeeds in a way which\r\nnecessitated a governmental commission of inquiry, empowered to take\r\nevidence on oath. The light in which the Petts were regarded is shown\r\nby a remark made by one man to another that he dared not speak, ‘for\r\nfear of being undone by the kindred ... they were all so knit together\r\nthat the devil himself could not discover them except one impeached the\r\nother.’ The result of the inquiry was a resolution that all the accused,\r\non both sides, should retain their places, a decision more likely to be\r\ndue to the impossibility of displacing experienced officers when war was\r\nimminent than to any inability to form an opinion.\r\n\r\nThe yearly salary of the master shipwright at Chatham was £103, 8s 4d,\r\nDeptford the same, and Woolwich £70. The building programme of the\r\ngovernment naturally tempted these men to add to their salaries the\r\nprofits to be made by having private yards for the construction of\r\nmen-of-war. Holland pointed out that this led to the shipwright’s absence\r\nfrom the state’s yard, to the exchange of good government workmen for bad\r\nof his own, and that usually a frigate turned out from a shipwright’s\r\nyard cost the country twice as much as one from a dockyard.[1458]\r\nHolland commented on another evil, the existence of beerhouses in the\r\ndockyards, ‘necessary at first, now one of the greatest abuses in the\r\nNavy.’ At least one ‘searcher’ was employed to prevent theft from the\r\ndockyards; but, judging from the small number of such cases reported, the\r\nprecautions taken or the higher standard induced in the men, had greatly\r\naltered former conditions for the better. In one instance, however, the\r\nwant of honesty shown by two men was attributed—it is painful to have\r\nto confess here—to their habit of reading ‘histrye books.’ The wages of\r\nshipwrights and caulkers were raised in April 1650 from 1s 10d to 2s 1d\r\na day, and again in 1652 to 2s 2d; they appear to have been punctually\r\npaid to a later date than the seamen, but in 1656, when they also were\r\nbeginning to suffer from the emptiness of the treasury and their wages\r\nto fall into arrear, the Council, with the dry humour of officialism,\r\nordered ‘an exact and punctual inspection and examination’ quarterly of\r\ntheir accounts. By 1658 they had, mostly, twelve months’ wages owing, but\r\ntheir murmurs were not nearly so loud as those of the seamen. Frequently\r\nduring 1659 they were working half-time or less, for want of materials.\r\nIn March 1660 there were not 100 yards of canvas remaining at either\r\nWoolwich or Deptford, the contractors would not supply more without\r\nready money; and we may assume that other necessaries were equally\r\nlacking.[1459] During part of 1659 there was only one forge going at\r\nPortsmouth, John Timbrell, the anchor-smith, having received no money for\r\ntwo years, and having been compelled to dismiss his men, being unable to\r\nprocure iron on credit. Timbrell was mayor of the town in 1662, so that\r\nthe Restoration apparently relieved him of his troubles.\r\n\r\nIn September 1658 the _Happy Entrance_ was destroyed by fire at Chatham,\r\na mishap attributed to carelessness on the part of the men at work on\r\nher, and the absence of supervision of the superior officials. This\r\ncaused the promulgation of an order the following month that no member\r\nof the superior dockyard staff should absent himself without leave\r\nfrom the Commissioner, and he only by permission of the Admiralty\r\nor Navy Commissioners, with a general penalty of dismissal for\r\ndisobedience.[1460] This order was to be framed and hung up in each yard.\r\nWhite’s invention of 1634 of iron mooring chains, noticed previously,\r\nwas now taken up by the government, and some were laid down at Chatham,\r\nDeptford, and Woolwich for ships to ride at, two to a chain. Mooring\r\nplaces for the use of merchantmen were granted to White, Bourne and\r\nothers at a rental of £5 a year.[1461] The dockyard chains weighed 2 cwt.\r\n2 qrs. 14 lbs. to a fathom, cost fivepence a pound, and were guaranteed\r\nfor two years.[1462] In 1658 a boom was ordered to be placed across the\r\nMedway at Upnor, but there is reason to believe that the order was not\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dean Forest.]\r\n\r\nAmong the Commonwealth experiments was that of using the wood and\r\niron ore of Dean Forest for the manufacture of iron for the supply of\r\nthe dockyards and private purchasers. As a ton of iron could be made\r\nthere for £3, 10s, and a ton of shot for £4, and sold respectively at\r\n£7 and £9, the enterprise was more profitable than most government\r\nundertakings.[1463] In 1656 the stock in hand was valued at £9446, which\r\nstood as net gain, all expenses being cleared;[1464] but, as Major Wade,\r\nwho was in charge, thought that one or two hundred tons of iron thrown\r\nupon the market ‘would surfeit the whole country,’ it was rather a book\r\nprofit than an actual one. However, from September 1654 to March 1659\r\nDean Forest supplied the Navy with 701 tons of shot and 88 tons of iron\r\nfittings; and from Sept. 1656 to April 1660 with 2300 tons of timber\r\nand 123,000 tree-nails,[1465] the saving thus effected being alone a\r\nsufficient justification of the new department. The plentiful yield of\r\ntimber suggested the advisability of building frigates on the spot, and\r\nthe _Grantham_ was launched at Lidney in 1654; she was followed by the\r\n_Forester_, and then the _Princess_ remained long in hand, since Furzer,\r\nthe master shipwright, was receiving only £2 a week of the £15 necessary\r\nto meet expenses. In October 1659 he wrote to the Navy Commissioners that\r\ninstead of attending to his duties he was forced to be away two or three\r\ndays in the week trying to borrow money.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Naval Expenditure.]\r\n\r\nThe following table, drawn up from the _Audit Office Declared Accounts_,\r\nshows the general expenditure for this period in round figures:—\r\n\r\n  +-----------+-----------+---------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n  |           |           |               |              |              |\r\n  |           |  Amounts  |               |              |              |\r\n  |           |  received |  Already      |              |              |\r\n  |           |and paid by|   owing       |  Victualling |Deptford[1466]|\r\n  |           | Treasurer |               |              |              |\r\n  +-----------+-----------+---------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n  |           |     £     |     £         |     £        |     £        |\r\n  |1649[1467]}|           |               |              |              |\r\n  |1650      }|    432,000|  233,500      | 149,000      |    8700[1468]|\r\n  |1651       |    446,000|  129,000      |  51,000      |     10,163   |\r\n  |1652       |    629,000|  238,000      |  88,000      |     10,900   |\r\n  |1653[1469] |  1,445,000|  335,000      | 269,000      |     12,600   |\r\n  |1654       |  1,117,000|  450,000      | 230,000      |     11,700   |\r\n  |1655       |    587,000|  466,000      |  70,000      |       8700   |\r\n  |1656       |    791,000|  473,000      | 209,000[1470]|       8000   |\r\n  |1657       |    746,000|  506,000      |              |       9000   |\r\n  |1658[1472]}|           |               |              |              |\r\n  |1660      }|  1,442,000|  714,000      |              |     11,800   |\r\n  |1660       |           |1,056,000[1473]|              |              |\r\n  +-----------+-----------+---------------+--------------+--------------+\r\n\r\n  +-----------+--------+-------+----------+-------------+\r\n  |           |        |       |          |             |\r\n  |           |        |       |          |             |\r\n  |           |        |       |          |             |\r\n  |           |Woolwich|Chatham|Portsmouth|    Wages    |\r\n  |           |        |       |          |             |\r\n  +-----------+--------+-------+----------+-------------+\r\n  |           |   £    |   £   |    £     |    £        |\r\n  |1649[1467]}|        |       |          |             |\r\n  |1650      }|    8786| 23,768|      5292|             |\r\n  |1651       |    7776| 19,089|      3783|             |\r\n  |1652       |    8381| 22,744|      6860|304,000      |\r\n  |1653[1469] |  12,500| 29,000|    13,700|227,000      |\r\n  |1654       |  13,500| 22,500|    15,700|225,000      |\r\n  |1655       |    7600| 21,800|      7700|             |\r\n  |1656       |    7000| 20,000|      7000|             |\r\n  |1657       |  10,300| 19,400|      6200|311,000[1471]|\r\n  |1658[1472]}|        |       |          |             |\r\n  |1660      }|  18,000| 25,000|      9000|447,000      |\r\n  |1660       |        |       |          |             |\r\n  +-----------+--------+-------+----------+-------------+\r\n\r\nThe Commonwealth began its naval administration hampered by a debt of\r\n£233,000, and it will be seen that, with the exception of 1650, during\r\nwhich year the arrears were partly paid off, it steadily grew in amount.\r\nBut comparing the national revenue, which had also to support a standing\r\narmy, with the sums devoted to the Navy, the wonder seems to be that\r\nthe debt was not larger. For the financial year ending 29th September\r\n1657 the total public income was £1,050,000, and of this £809,000 was\r\nassigned to naval purposes; for 1658 £951,000, of which the Navy took\r\n£624,000.[1474] The receipts for 1659 were put at £1,517,000,[1475] and\r\nthe Navy estimates at £848,000[1476].\r\n\r\nThe strain began to be most seriously felt from 1653, when, in September,\r\nthe Navy Commissioners warned their chiefs that £1,115,000 was required\r\nbefore 31st December, without including the cost of the vessels on\r\nthe stocks or that of the winter fleet; no provision, they said, had\r\nbeen made for this and ‘we find it necessary to lay before you the\r\ndaily clamours we undergo for want thereof.’[1477] In October 1654\r\nthe Admiralty Commissioners apprised the Protector that the credit\r\nof the Government was so greatly impaired that stores could not be\r\nobtained except for ready money; yet £1,117,000 in cash passed through\r\nthe Treasurer’s hands in this year. This sum was procured from many\r\nsources—excise, £262,000; treasurer-at-wars, £424,000; customs, £162,000;\r\n‘profits arising by probate of wills,’ £1163; commissioners for Dutch\r\nprizes, £2029; commissioners for prize goods, £44,000; treasurer at Drury\r\nHouse, £16,000;[1478] Col. Barkstead,[1479] £44,000; from the exchequer,\r\n£131,000; and defalcations and sale of stores, £31,000. Notwithstanding\r\nthese receipts the Admiralty Commissioners wrote in April 1655 to the\r\nCouncil that they had only been able to pay seamen’s wages, that all\r\nother debts remained unpaid, and that the yards were exhausted of\r\nstores.[1480] Straitened as they were, the Council, two months later,\r\nwere not deterred from ordering 2000 Bibles for the soldiers in the West\r\nIndies, although the fact that the commissioners of the treasury had to\r\n‘consider’ how they could be paid for seems to imply that Bibles were\r\nno more to be obtained on credit than cordage. On at least one occasion\r\nOliver appears to have himself advanced £10,000 to the Navy Office.[1481]\r\n\r\nThe debt increased, but the revenue did not show the same elasticity;\r\nall that the Admiralty Commissioners could do, themselves almost daily\r\ninvoked by the Navy Commissioners, was to carry on the appeal to the\r\nCouncil, ‘finding every day a sad increase of the just complaints of\r\nseveral persons for money long since due.’ This was in 1658, but in\r\nMarch of the following year they wrote bitterly to the Council that,\r\nwhile such large debts were contracted and they were struggling with\r\ndifficulties, it made them ‘exceeding unhappy’ to see that even their\r\nassignments on the customs were not handed over to them in full.[1482] In\r\nMay 1659, among other items, £330,000 was owing for seamen’s and £43,000\r\nfor dockyard wages, and the £735 a week paid by the Navy Treasurer to\r\nthe Savoy and Ely House hospitals was six months over-due.[1483] In\r\nSeptember the army commissioners were directed to hand over £60,000\r\nfor naval purposes, although the soldiers’ pay was months in arrear.\r\nWhen the Commonwealth accounts close on 7th July 1660 the debt was\r\n£1,056,000.[1484] For this large sum every year from 1640 furnished its\r\nquota, thus detailed:—1640-9, £10,200; 1650, £71,000; 1651, £25,000;\r\n1652, £16,000; 1653, £11,000; 1654, £5000; 1655, £50,000; 1656,\r\n£229,000; 1657, £218,000; 1660, £421,000. That the earlier amounts were\r\nnot merely book debts carried forward for want of claimants is shown by\r\nthe existence of a petition, of April 1658, begging for the settlement\r\nof a bill for freight incurred between 1643 and 1651.[1485] These\r\nliabilities, belonging to only one branch of the public service, help\r\nto explain why many classes of society, not actively royalist, may have\r\nwelcomed a restoration which promised a settlement of debts and a more\r\nstable financial system.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Flags and The Salute.]\r\n\r\nWhen the St George’s cross was made the national flag in February 1648-9,\r\nit was also ordered that an escutcheon should be carried on the stern of\r\neach man-of-war, containing a red cross in one compartment and a harp in\r\nanother. In 1653 the three Generals at sea used, besides their standards,\r\na pendant of red, white, or blue, at the main, and their vice- and\r\nrear-admirals their respective colours at the fore and mizen. From 18th\r\nMay 1658 the standard of the General of the fleet was to bear the arms of\r\nEngland, Scotland, and Ireland, ‘with his Highnes’ escutcheon of pretence\r\naccording to the great seal of England.’ The jack flag for admirals\r\nwas to consist of the arms of England and Scotland united, ‘according\r\nto the ancient form,’ with the harp added, ‘according to a model now\r\nshown.’[1486] All saluting, whether from ships or forts, was strictly\r\nforbidden in 1652, except in honour of ambassadors; but the salute to the\r\nflag from foreigners was firmly upheld under all circumstances. By the\r\ntreaty of 5th April 1654, the Dutch formally acknowledged the English\r\nright to the salute in the ‘British seas.’ In 1657 Opdam, with thirty\r\nDutch sail, passing Dover struck his flag and saluted the castle; shortly\r\nafterwards he met the _Dragon_ and the _Colchester_, whose captains\r\nordered him again to strike. He refused, saying that he was not expected\r\nto pay this mark of respect to every ship he met, whereupon they replied\r\nthat if he did not they would engage him till they sank alongside. Then\r\n‘he struck in a great rage,’ and kept his flag down till out of sight of\r\nthe Englishmen. Man-of-war captains sometimes displayed the same feeling\r\nof pride in their position at the expense of English ships. In 1654 a\r\nVirginiaman was run down and sunk in the Channel by the _Ruby_. In the\r\nsubsequent inquiry the master of the merchantman held that the _Ruby_\r\nshould have gone astern of his vessel, to which her captain retorted by\r\nasking, ‘How many men-of-war have you known go under a merchantman’s\r\nstern?’\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prices.]\r\n\r\nThe prices of naval stores varied greatly, according to the confidence\r\nfelt in the treasury and conditions of peace or war; the following are\r\nthe rates for some of the principal articles:—\r\n\r\n  IRON ORDNANCE\r\n    1650, £20 a ton\r\n    1653, £26   ”\r\n\r\n  CANVAS\r\n    Noyals, 1652, £15 to £17 a bale[1487]\r\n    Noyals, 1654, £19, 7s a bale\r\n    Vitery, 1654, 1s a yard\r\n    Vitery, 1655, 1s 4d an ell\r\n    Ipswich, 1654, £1, 12s a bolt\r\n    Ipswich, 1655, £1, 7s 9d a bolt\r\n\r\n  HEMP\r\n    1653, £32 a ton (English)\r\n    1655, £38, 10s a ton (Riga)\r\n    1657, £44 a ton (Riga)\r\n    1658, £46 a ton (Riga)\r\n    1658, £33 a ton (English)\r\n    1658, £38 a ton (Russia)\r\n\r\n  ANCHORS\r\n    1656, £34 a ton\r\n      ”   £37  ”\r\n\r\n  POWDER\r\n    1650, £3, 16s a barrel\r\n    1652, £4         ”\r\n    1653, £4, 10s    ”\r\n\r\n  PLANK\r\n    1653, £2, 18s a load\r\n    1655, £3, 7s    ”\r\n    1657, £3, 5s    ” (oak)\r\n    1659, £3, 15s   ”   ”\r\n\r\n  SMALL ARMS\r\n    Snaphaunces, 1658, 11s 6d each\r\n    Matchlocks, 1658, 10s 6d each\r\n    Carbines, 1658, 11s each\r\n    Pistols, 1658, 14s a pair\r\n\r\n  BLACK ROSIN\r\n    1655, £10, 10s a ton\r\n    1657, £10 a ton (Mar.)\r\n    1657, £9, 5s ”  (Aug.)\r\n\r\n  COMPASS TIMBER\r\n    1656, £2, 5s a load\r\n    1658, £3 ”\r\n\r\n  CORDAGE\r\n    1649, £30 a ton\r\n    1656, £44    ”\r\n    1657, £48    ”\r\n    1658, £44    ”\r\n\r\n  SHOT\r\n    1652, £11, 10s a ton\r\n    1653, £14 a ton\r\n\r\n  TAR\r\n    1654, £1, 15s a barrel\r\n    1655, £10, 12s a last\r\n    1656, £12 a last\r\n    1657, £12, 10s a last\r\n    1658, £13 a last\r\n\r\n  PITCH\r\n    1654, £1, 16s a barrel\r\n    1655, £15, 5s a last\r\n\r\n  BEER\r\n    1654, £1, 15s a tun\r\n    1659, £2, 5s  ”\r\n\r\n  SPRUTIA[1488] DEALS\r\n    1656, 12s 6d each\r\n    1659, 14s     ”\r\n\r\n  ORDINARY DEALS\r\n    1657, £4, 3s per 100 of six score\r\n\r\n  WHALE OIL\r\n    1659, £26, 15s a ton\r\n\r\n  ENGLISH TALLOW\r\n    1658, £2, 3s per cwt.\r\n\r\n  LIGNUM VITÆ for blocks\r\n    1656, £6, 15s a ton\r\n\r\nExamples of that incongruity of expression usually associated with\r\nPuritan fervour are not frequent among the Navy papers, but they do\r\noccasionally occur. On one occasion Lawson writes, ‘All that look towards\r\nZion should hold Christian communion—we have all the guns aboard.’\r\nMajor Robert Sedgwick, starting for the West Indies, asks the Navy\r\nCommissioners, after official details, for ‘your prayers that we may be\r\nsent out with a blessing and be a blessing where we go.’ Major Sedgwick’s\r\nduties were to kill Spaniards, plunder their property, and annex their\r\nterritory. These men were too grimly earnest in the work they set their\r\nhands to do to trouble themselves about fine phrases. They lacked humour,\r\nand the court of Charles II was, we are taught, very witty; but when, in\r\n1667, the roar of foreign guns was, for the only time in English history,\r\nheard in London, even that majority which always loves a royal jest must\r\nhave begun to appreciate the distinction underlying Stewart wit and\r\nPuritan dulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A\r\n\r\nCHAPTER HOUSE BOOK VOL.

_Rainbow_, and _Spy_, of the Queen’s, and some twenty\r\narmed merchantmen attacked Cadiz, with results disastrous to Spain.\r\nBorough was vice-admiral and in command of the _Lion_. The fleet left\r\nCadiz harbour on 21st April, and on the 30th Borough addressed a long\r\nand vigorously worded letter to Drake[1532] protesting that the councils\r\nof war called were only nominal consultations where the admiral declared\r\nhis will, or else merely entertained his visitors who departed ‘without\r\nany consultacyon or counsell holden.’ Drake’s answer was to supersede\r\nhim. All we know further is that on 27th May the _Lion’s_ company put\r\ntheir new captain, Marchant, on the _Spy_, and sailed away for England\r\nwith Borough who afterwards declared that he was in daily fear of his\r\nlife, and therefore had no great reason to try and stop their action. If\r\nBorough did not incite them to mutiny the men of the _Lion_ must have\r\nbeen for some time full of discontent and ready to desert. The chase of\r\nthe Bark of Lyme, which took them from under the guns of the rest of\r\nthe fleet, gave them their opportunity. On 30th May, Drake constituted\r\na court-martial on the _Bonaventure_, of himself and the other superior\r\nofficers, at which most of the mutineers were condemned to death in their\r\nabsence. The account of this inquiry gives a vivid picture of the modes\r\nof thought among the men, and their ideas of their rights and duties.\r\n\r\nAlthough time has settled the historical perspective in which we view\r\nDrake and Borough, it must be said for the latter that, in 1587, the\r\nadmiral was only to him, one of half-a-dozen great seamen with whom\r\nBorough, and doubtless his contemporaries, thought he could claim\r\nequality. He was an experienced commander and one of the four Principal\r\nOfficers of the Navy; he was, here, second in command to Drake, and it\r\nwas contrary to all the traditions of the service that the admiral should\r\nundertake any enterprise without the advice and consent of his captains.\r\nIn this matter Drake was one of the first expedition leaders to strike\r\nout a line of his own, and Borough, tenacious of custom and what he\r\nconsidered his rights, at once came into collision with him. It was long\r\nbefore Drake’s principle of accepting sole responsibility was generally\r\nfollowed. In a private note of farewell to Burghley in 1596, and perhaps\r\nwith this incident in his mind, Howard, when leaving for the Cadiz voyage\r\nwrote,\r\n\r\n    ‘I have no meaning to ronne any rash or unadvysed course nor to\r\n    settell any thyng for Her Maiesties servyce upon my own jugment\r\n    but to yeald to those that shall show best reson.’[1533]\r\n\r\nAfter their return an inquiry was held at which the vice-admiral was\r\ncharged with neglect of duty at Cadiz.[1534] No actual result followed,\r\nbut Borough came off with the honours of war since he was not disgraced,\r\nand remained one of the chief Officers of the Navy. Burghley appears to\r\nhave been on his side, and Borough wrote subsequently an effusive letter\r\nthanking him ardently for his support.[1535] From one passage in this\r\nletter in which he says that he had hoped that after the inquiry his\r\ninnocence would be proclaimed, but that ‘I have suppressed my greefe\r\nin respect of the comandment and charge given me,’ it may be inferred\r\nthat the finding was actually favourable to Borough but not made public,\r\nperhaps from a desire not to offend Drake. One other point is worth\r\nnoticing: if the crew of the _Lion_ voiced the general feeling among\r\nEnglish seamen, Drake was certainly not loved by them.\r\n\r\n                   ADD. MSS., 12,505, f., 241.[1536]\r\n\r\n    =A generall courte holden for the service of her Maᵗⁱᵉ abourde\r\n    the _Elizabeth Bonaventure_ the xxxth day of Maye before Sir\r\n    Ffrauncis Drake, knighte, generall of Her Maᵗⁱᵉˢ fleete; Thomas\r\n    Fennard, Vice-Admirall; Anthony Plotte, Leivetenant-generall;\r\n    John Marchant, serjant-major, and the reste of the captaines\r\n    and masters of the fleete as followeth,=\r\n\r\n    The generall, att this courte, called in question and\r\n    judiciallye demaunded of Captayne Merchaunt howe he colde\r\n    discharge himselfe to answere the departure of Her Maᵗⁱᵉˢ\r\n    shippe the _Golden Lyon_ which he latelye gave him in charge?\r\n\r\n    Captayne Marchaunt protestinge, with all earnest affeccon,\r\n    his innocencye alledged and declared,—That there was a great\r\n    Mutynie growen amonge the Company of the _Lyon_ the 27 of this\r\n    month; as sone as we had given over the chase undertaken,\r\n    understandinge that she was the Barke of Lyme,[1537] when I\r\n    requyred the Master that we mighte lye close by the wynde to\r\n    recover our generall, the Master answered, ‘Well, Captaine,\r\n    we will.’ But presentely one of the quartermasters came and\r\n    delivered me a lettere in the behalfe of the whole company as\r\n    followeth:—\r\n\r\n    ‘Captayne Marchaunt, Captayne of the _Golden Lyon_ appoynted\r\n    by Sir Ffrauncis Drake, generall of this fleete,—Wee, the\r\n    Quenes, and yours at this tyme desyre that, as you are a man\r\n    and beare the name of a captayne over us, so to weighe of us\r\n    like men, and lett us not be spoyled for wante of foode, for\r\n    our allowaunce is so smale we are not able to lyve any longer\r\n    of it; for when as three or foure were wonte to take a charge\r\n    in hande, nowe tenne at the leaste, by reason of our weake\r\n    victuallinge and filthie drinck, is scarce able to discharge\r\n    it, and yet growe rather weaker and weaker; which suerly if\r\n    it be not loked into, will growe to greate dishonour on your\r\n    parte, and to a lastinge shame on our sydes, by reason of\r\n    the moste worthie and the moste honorable challendge of our\r\n    generall at Caste Calleys[1538] in daringe the kinges deputie,\r\n    or the kinge himselfe if he were in place, or the proudest\r\n    champyon he had to come fourthe and chaunge a Bullett with him;\r\n    but none durste once adventure to come forthe unto him, but\r\n    the Cowardlike knightes sayde they were not readye for him: a\r\n    moste worthye enterprise, deservinge lastinge fame to come to\r\n    the gates of his Courte, yea the strongest holde of his lande,\r\n    and dare him fourthe. Our hartes were then so boldened and our\r\n    stomackes so coragiouslye bente, that if theye had byn Tenne to\r\n    one we rather wished to fighte than to goo to dynner. But nowe,\r\n    most unfortunate and unluckie chaunce fallen amongest us by\r\n    weakeninge of our Lymes, and feblenes of our bodyes, we are not\r\n    able to abyde the force of them as nowe, and thoughe they be\r\n    but one to one, the more is our greife; for what is a piece of\r\n    Beefe of halfe a pounde amonge foure men to dynner or halfe a\r\n    drye Stockfishe for foure dayes in the weeke, and nothing elles\r\n    to helpe withall—Yea, wee have helpe, a litle Beveredge[1539]\r\n    worse than the pompe water. Wee were preste by her Maᵗⁱᵉˢ\r\n    presse to have her allowaunce, and not to be thus dealt\r\n    withall, you make no men of us, but beastes. And therefore wee\r\n    are not determyned to goe any further, but as we broughte the\r\n    _Lyon_, with our Master’s helpe, fourth, so wee will carye her\r\n    home agayne by the helpe of God, for as the wynde is faire and\r\n    home we will. And thus Captayne Marchaunt thinke of us as you\r\n    will and lett us have more victualles to bringe us home, for as\r\n    longe as it please God this wynde to blowe we will not alter\r\n    our corse, but home straighte and so thinck of us as you please.\r\n\r\n    The Quenes men and yours homewardes to our powers.’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    And there withall came the Master unto me sayinge, That there\r\n    was not a man that wolde sett his handes to the saylles.\r\n\r\n    Noe Master, quoth I, what is it you can not comaunde them to\r\n    doe, beinge Master of the shippe! Strike the sayles, but it\r\n    colde not be don for the yeardes weare alonge[1540] before\r\n    hande, and the Toppes and Shrowdes manned, and the Master sayde\r\n    they wolde doe nothinge for him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    To appease this Mutanie I came amonge them myselfe saying,\r\n    My masters, what soden Mutaine is this amonge you? colde not\r\n    this have byn spoken of when we were neare the generall, yf any\r\n    thinge had byn amys there yt had byn redressed; I wolde wishe\r\n    you take a better corse then this for yt will not be answered.\r\n    Wherewith for the whole company spake one Crowe, that they\r\n    wolde not loose the wynde which was fayre and further theye\r\n    wolde not goe.\r\n\r\n    I showed them also that for theire victualles there was in the\r\n    shippe by the confession of the Pursur sufficient for 30 dayes,\r\n    assuringe them also on my life that as sone as they came to the\r\n    generall they sholde have a monthes victuall put abourde them\r\n    presentlye.[1541] But theye cryed alowde they wolde all home,\r\n    excepte some xii or xvi gentlemen and officers.\r\n\r\n    To perswade them the rather to staye I said moreover unto\r\n    them, My Masters, I will nowe imparte unto you a matter which\r\n    I thoughte to have secreyted untill another tyme, That there\r\n    is an Island of greate ritches promysed to be delivered to our\r\n    generall without the losse of one man, I praye you therefore\r\n    staye and talke with him, and he will laye you downe such\r\n    reason as shalbe to the contentacon of you all. Whereat one\r\n    Cornelius one of the gunners said, Well, Captayne, at your\r\n    requeste we will staye till nighte to speake with the generall,\r\n    for the which I thanked them all hartylie; howbeit they\r\n    presentely layde theire heades togither agayne and came with\r\n    one voyce sayinge, the wynde is good, we will not staye, we\r\n    will awaye, all! all! all! When I sawe the Mutaine so farre\r\n    growen I requested Mr Boroughes that he wolde worke a meane\r\n    with them to cause them staye, untill they cam to the generall\r\n    that they might acknowledge him and departe in good order from\r\n    him. They answered presentely that they wolde not staye for the\r\n    generall for they knewe what order he wolde take with them.\r\n\r\n    In the moste of their mutanie I saide unto them, What! is there\r\n    no honest man will acknowledge their generall, and therewith\r\n    willed as many as wolde so doe to holde up their hands, which\r\n    aboute xii or xvi gentlemen and officers did; the reste cryed,\r\n    home! home!\r\n\r\n    Then I said, My masters, this plate[1542] hath byn layde before\r\n    now by the principalles, not by the common sorte which will not\r\n    be answered. Why, quoth Mr Boroughes, howe speake you that,\r\n    meane you me? I answered, I wolde I knewe it were you, then\r\n    wolde I sone tell you of it, but I am suer it is don by the\r\n    principalles.\r\n\r\n    Whereupon I requested then I mighte be sett aborde the Quenes\r\n    pinnis. They tolde me, Noe, that they colde carye me as safe\r\n    into England as Sir Ffrauncis Drake colde. I answered I wolde\r\n    never be caryed into England by such a company of unhonest\r\n    persons as theye were.\r\n\r\n    Then I requested Mr Borughes that he wolde deale with the\r\n    Company that I mighte departe for I knewe he might do it. My\r\n    masters, said he, what unreasonable men are you, will you\r\n    neither staye for the admyrall nor lett the man departe! Lett\r\n    him departe for shame or elles staye for the admyrall, doe one\r\n    of the two. Then said Crowe, well Captayne, if you saye the\r\n    worde you shall goe; with that theye were contente.\r\n\r\n    Then once more I requested Mr Borughes as he was a gentleman\r\n    and tendred the accon[1543] that he wolde deale once more with\r\n    the company, for I knewe he might doe it, and promysed as I was\r\n    a Christian that there sholde not one here of theire heddes\r\n    perishe, Soe as theye wolde staye and speake with the generall.\r\n\r\n    He retorned to me agayne this answere, Captaine Marchaunt I\r\n    have talked with them and theire answere is this, They have had\r\n    many promises and little performance, therefore they will staye\r\n    noe longer.\r\n\r\n    When I sawe them so bent I called to Captaine Clifforde who was\r\n    in the Quenes pynnis desyringe him to take me in and bringe me\r\n    to the generall, for that I wolde not be caried into England by\r\n    a company of such unruly persons.\r\n\r\n    He cryed unto me that he wolde have me in or elles come abourde\r\n    for me himself, but theye manned theire Boate and sett me\r\n    aboarde, which, when one of those in the toppe perceaved, he\r\n    cryed with an othe, What! will you let him goe! Yf he fetche\r\n    up the Admyrall before nighte he will overtake us and then you\r\n    shall see what worke he will make with us.\r\n\r\n    In the middest of the mutinie I callid the Pursur unto me and\r\n    demaunded of him for what cause the company had stinckinge\r\n    beveredge to drincke, as there were in the shippe 15 tounes\r\n    of beare, sayinge, that if theye had any such theye sholde\r\n    have it in thende and drincke the beare as longe as it lasted.\r\n    Whereupon the company with one voyce cryed, Yea, Captaine, God\r\n    save your life, yt is your will we knowe that we sholde have\r\n    it; but we have it not.\r\n\r\n    The daye before theis matters brake forthe I ymparted my\r\n    mynde to Mr Borughes, tellinge him that scince the generall\r\n    is bounde for the Ilandes the next fayre daye that cometh, I\r\n    will goe abourde him and geve him to understand in what case\r\n    we stande for victualles that we maye be the better provyded\r\n    whatsoever befall. Nay, said he, the pursur hath byn with him\r\n    and he understandeth it alreadye for that wilbe a meane yf he\r\n    be not mynded to goe for the Ilandes to make him goe thither.\r\n    And therefore if he will runn into the Indies lett him run,\r\n    he knoweth alreadye what we want, never goe to him at all for\r\n    any thinge. Then, I said, when the Pursur was with him he was\r\n    so busie as he cold not have any leasure and therefore willed\r\n    him to resorte unto him at another tyme. He[1544] answered as\r\n    he did at the firste. The same tyme that the _Raynebowe_ had\r\n    her mayne sayle taken from the yearde by weather the Captaine\r\n    of her desired me to beare up with the generall to give him\r\n    to understand of his distres. Then quoth Mr Boroughes, The\r\n    generall seeth in what case he is and beareth all the sayle he\r\n    can and stayeth not for him, let us staye by him and helpe him.\r\n    But his desyre is, quothe I, that the generall sholde knowe it\r\n    presentlye and that his foremast is spent. Thereto Mr Boroughes\r\n    answered, The Captaine is a foole and he knoweth not what\r\n    belongeth to it so well as I doe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Captaine Clifford sayth and testifieth that a such tyme as he\r\n    came nere the _Golden Lyon_ to take in Captaine Marchaunte he\r\n    callid to the master of the same shippe, wishinge him to have\r\n    care of himselfe, to bringe backe the shippe to the generall\r\n    and to appease the companye, for that he knewe he was a man\r\n    colde doe much amonge them, addinge further that he was not\r\n    able to answere it at his cominge home. He answered he colde\r\n    not doe withall and the company were resolved to goe home. The\r\n    master of the same pinnisse spake unto him in like manner, or a\r\n    greate deale more.\r\n\r\n    Then Captaine Clifforde called to the company and tolde them\r\n    that if theye wente awaye with her Maiesties Shippe some of\r\n    them wolde be hanged, upon which wordes Captayne Marchaunt hard\r\n    them call Capteine Clifforde, Arrant villane.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Upon dewe consideracon whereof the generall sayde:—Althoughe\r\n    I am not dobtefull what to doe in this case, or yet want any\r\n    aucthoritie, but myselfe have from Her Maiestie sufficient\r\n    Jurisdiccon to correcte and punnishe with all severitie as\r\n    to me in discretion shalbe meete, Accordinge to the Qualitie\r\n    of the offences, all those sceditious persons which sholl be\r\n    in the whole fleete, yet for the confidence I have in your\r\n    discretions, as also to wytnes our agreament in Judgement in\r\n    all matters, I praye you lett me heare your severall opynions\r\n    touching this facte which hath byn declared in your hearinge\r\n    this daye; In my judgement it was as fowle and untollerable a\r\n    mutanye as ever I have knowne. Captyne Marchant hath discharged\r\n    his dutie faythefull as a true servitor unto her Maiestie; all\r\n    the rest of that shippe, exceptinge only those 12 or 16 which\r\n    helde up theire handes to wytnes theire wyllingnes to retorne\r\n    to our company have deserved a shamfull deathe in that theye\r\n    have forsaken her Maiesties standerd and conyssyon and forsaken\r\n    her Maiesties Shippes Royal beinge distressed, and as much as\r\n    in them lyeth hindreth the service in hande for the honor and\r\n    saffetye of her Maiesties realmes and domynyons.

Modern punctuation has been inserted where necessary.\r\n\r\n    The xxvii of Maye 1587 beinge Satterdaye assone as yt was\r\n    dayelighte wee sawe a sayle a heade of us, which was north\r\n    northeaste from us as farr as wee coulde well see her; unto\r\n    the which we gave chase by the comaundement of our captaine,\r\n    captaine Marchaunte, for that wee thought her to be a Spanierd\r\n    or Portingall, the winde beinge at weste southweste, our\r\n    generall with those shipps which were with hime beinge then\r\n    in sighte of us, and not then farr from us; but the generall\r\n    kepinge nearer the winde then wee did, for that wee followed\r\n    chase after the sayle which we sawe as aforesayd, wee lost the\r\n    sight of the generall with the reste of those that were with\r\n    him, then beinge abowte eighte of the clocke in the morninge,\r\n    then beinge with us in companie the _Spie_ of her Maiesties,\r\n    both of us still followinge the chase. And abowte eleven of the\r\n    clock before none, beinge then but three houres after wee had\r\n    lost sight of the generall, wee sett up the sayle and spake\r\n    with him, yt was one of our owne companie, a Barke of Lyme, but\r\n    shee departed from us a five dayes before with others for to\r\n    come home for England.\r\n\r\n    As sone as wee had spoken with this Barke I called unto\r\n    the companye as yt is the use of sea menn for to doe, and\r\n    willed them to take in our sprett sayle but they awnswered\r\n    me not that I hearde anie thinge att all at that time; but\r\n    I thinkinge that it had bin doun according as I willed them\r\n    which was that they should gett yt in. A little while after I\r\n    came forewardes againe to the mayne maste, and asked, What?\r\n    is your sprett seyle in? but none awnswered, neither that yt\r\n    was in, nor that it was not in, and John Terrye, beinge one\r\n    of our quartermasters, walkinge afore the maste, I called\r\n    unto him and willed that the Sprett Sayle shoulde be got in\r\n    that wee might kepe our loofe;[1545] he awnswered me that the\r\n    companie said theye would not take yt in. No! said I, what is\r\n    the cawse? Whoe be they that saye they will not? He awnswered,\r\n    they all in generall saye soe; I demaunded, Whie will they not?\r\n    he awnswered that the captaine, captaine Marchaunt, knew the\r\n    cawse, and that the cawse whie was delivered him in writinge.\r\n    Then I went unto the captaine, he, with his lieftenaunte Mr\r\n    Nicholls, beinge then readinge the letter which was delivered\r\n    the captaine; I also seinge parte of the bill read, wente\r\n    forwarde againe to the maste and called unto them and willed\r\n    them that they should gett in theire sprett sayle and haile\r\n    afte our shoowtes[1546] that wee might goe unto our generall\r\n    and the reste of the fflete, but none of them would goe abowte\r\n    to doe yt by anie sayinge that I coulde saye unto them. Then I\r\n    wente unto the captaine, captaine Marchaunte, and toulde him\r\n    that I had willed the companie to gett in the Sprett Sayle\r\n    and hale after our showttes, but I could gett none of them\r\n    to doe yt by anie meanes; he himself then goinge forwarde to\r\n    the mayne maste, demaunded, whie they did not as the master\r\n    comaunded them, and, as yt will be proved he comaunded them\r\n    in her maiesties name to doe yt. The moste parte of them\r\n    awnswered hime that they would not, but that they would goe for\r\n    England, for the winde is nowe good, and that they would not\r\n    goe backe againe and be starved for wante of victualls; the\r\n    captaine awnsweringe them againe sayd, Contente yourselves,\r\n    what victualls soever are in the shipp you shall have yt, and\r\n    therefore holde yourselves contente untill wee mete with our\r\n    generall. They said againe, they have had manye faire woordes,\r\n    but nothing performed in dedes. Then I myself, perswaded them\r\n    that theye would contente themselves and that they woulde hale\r\n    afte the showttes, that wee might tarrye and not goe home,\r\n    but that the generall shoulde knowe of theire goinge, and not\r\n    for to goe awaye in that sorte, not makinge him acqueinted\r\n    of the departure of the shipp, and soe likewise did captaine\r\n    Marchaunte requeste them that if theye woulde nedes goe that\r\n    they would stay but untill nighte to see yf wee coulde possible\r\n    mete with the generall, yf not that then they might doe as\r\n    they thought good; and Mr Burrowes did likewise intreate with\r\n    them that they, would staye and not goe awaye in that order;\r\n    then Cornelius the Gonner intreated with the reste of the\r\n    Gonners and parte of the companie to tarrie untill nighte to\r\n    see yf wee could mete with the generall, and with mutch adoe\r\n    had almoste gott them to staye. And then I willed them to hale\r\n    afte our showttes, and willed hime to putt the healme to Lee,\r\n    and keep his Loofe, but yt was not donn as I willed them; then\r\n    I wente afte to see yf the helme were a Lee as I willed hime\r\n    to putt yt, and looked downe at the Skuttle, and there I sawe\r\n    one bearinge the helme on the contrarye syde which was on the\r\n    weather syde which was one Crowe. Then I called unto him and\r\n    willed him to putt on the Lee, but he would not doe yt by anie\r\n    meanes; then I called unto him againe and asked him, Whie\r\n    doest thou not as I bidd thee, you wilbe Master belike, will\r\n    you! said I unto him, whoe awnswered me, Yea, that I will, and\r\n    Captaine to for a tyme, untill there be other order taken! so\r\n    that neither the helme was putt alee not yet I coulde gett the\r\n    showttes haled afte.\r\n\r\n    Then I wente and certified the Captaine what awnswer was made\r\n    me by Crowe: and then saide the companie we will not staye\r\n    to speake with the generall; the cawse was asked by me whie\r\n    the would not staye, (of Cornelius the gonner because he did\r\n    saye unto the captaine that he would perswade them to tarrye\r\n    untill nighte to speake with the General), then Cornelius\r\n    awnswered that they said theye would not staye for feare that\r\n    the generall would take them owte of the _Lyon_, and shifte\r\n    them into other shipps, and then use suche punishemente unto\r\n    them as he thought good, and therefore they would not tarrie\r\n    but go home for England, for they would rather truste to the\r\n    Quenes mercye then unto the curteseye of the generall, and\r\n    that they would awnswer yt at home that they had donn. When\r\n    Captaine Marchaunte sawe that by no perswasioun they would\r\n    alter there mynds he was verye angrye, and said that this was\r\n    no newe matter begonn, but that yt bin begoon to have bin\r\n    practised before this tyme by somme of the beste and not of the\r\n    worste. Then I replied againe and said that I, for my part,\r\n    am ignoraunte and never knewe of the matter before this tyme,\r\n    nether did I ever knowe whoe did beginn yt, and therefore Sir\r\n    I praye you doe not chardge me with anie suche thinge, ffor\r\n    tryall whereof I called the companie and certified them of the\r\n    woorde that Captaine Marchaunte spake, and they generallie (I\r\n    meane those men that were at this broyle) confessed and saide\r\n    that as God shoulde iudge them that neither I nor Mr Burrowes\r\n    was ever consentinge unto the matter, but that yt was theire\r\n    owne doinge and that theye would awnswer yt.\r\n\r\n    Then Captaine Marchaunt and I fell to perswadinge them again\r\n    to tarrie but by no meanes they woulde at our requeste yelde\r\n    unto yt; then the captaine tolde them that he would not goe for\r\n    England but that he would rather leape into the sea then goe\r\n    home. Then John Tippett standinge by the mayne maste drewe oute\r\n    his kniffe and cutt the halliardes of the mayne Toppsayle that\r\n    yt might comme downe but theye had slonge the yarde alofte soe\r\n    that the sayle coulde not comme downe. Then Captaine Marchaunte\r\n    prayed them that yf by noe meanes theye would staye for the\r\n    Generall untill nighte that theye would sett him aboorde of\r\n    the _Spie_ her Maiesties pinnase who was all this while with\r\n    us, and with mutche adoe gott them at the laste to doe yt, and\r\n    I myself did offer the captaine to goe with hime aboord the\r\n    generall but he was not willinge that I shoulde, and yett I\r\n    offered to goe with hime twise.\r\n\r\n    And Captaine Clefforde, captaine of the _Spie_ sawe all this\r\n    broyle in our shipp; he called unto me and said, Master, have\r\n    a care of your creditt; I awnswered him againe, Alack sir! I\r\n    am but one mann, I have donn as muche as I can to perswade\r\n    them but by noe intreatye can make them to tarrie. Then\r\n    Captaine Clefforthe called unto them and saide, Take hede\r\n    what you doe for you wilbe hanged all of you! Then one of our\r\n    gouners standing uppon our poope awnswered Captaine Clefforthe\r\n    againe, and saide, Cutt hose! cutt hose! where were you when\r\n    the _Samaritane_ was aground uppon the rock? And one of our\r\n    quartermasters did saye, I thancke you Sir for your sharpe\r\n    judgmente, yt is a harde fought feeld were none escapethe! And\r\n    when our captaine was in the boate at shipp sterne Mr Burrowes\r\n    fell to perswadinge them againe to staye untill nighte but\r\n    theye would not in anie case staye. Then our captaine, captaine\r\n    Marchaunte went aboord of the _Spie_ and soe she went awaye\r\n    from us, and wee laye by the Lee for our boate; and in the\r\n    meane tyme, whyle the boate was awaye, I said unto them, Sirs,\r\n    what have you donn, you have donn you knowe not what, you care\r\n    not, but I knowe that I and Mr Burrowes shalbe brought to be\r\n    in all the faulte; yf you would have donn thus and goe awaye\r\n    in this order, whie did you not tell neither the captaine nor\r\n    me the other daye when as we spake with the Generall, that wee\r\n    might have given him to understand that you woulde goe for\r\n    England, that he might have provided more victualls for you\r\n    yf that you shoulde staye, and not thus to goe awaye? But noe\r\n    perswasiouns woulde serve but home they would and soe they\r\n    haled abowte the sayles and homewards theye came. And this was\r\n    not the doinge of one or twoe of them but the consente of them\r\n    in generall, or the moste parte of them, as well souldiers as\r\n    maryners excepte those that were sicke at that tyme; and this\r\n    is the trewithe and nothinge but the trewithe as yt shalbe\r\n    proved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN HAWKYNS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question whether Hawkyns was dishonest is not in one sense of much\r\nimportance, since it is admitted that he was skilful as a seaman, and\r\nefficient as an administrator. In another sense the good or ill fame\r\nof a national worthy is of the highest importance as interwoven with\r\nnational history, and therefore a factor in the memories which make\r\nfor the self-respect of a nation. As in the _Dictionary of National\r\nBiography_, a work which will be the standard authority for posterity,\r\nHawkyns is considered to have been guilty, it is fitting that, in a study\r\nof Elizabethan naval administration, the charges should be examined\r\nsomewhat minutely. His memory has suffered from his reputed introduction\r\nof the slave trade into English commerce, and from the cumulative effects\r\nof accusations brought against him, which have been accepted without\r\ninvestigation of their nature or of the character of the accusers. His\r\nreputation has also suffered from the indiscriminate praise lavished upon\r\nhim by ill-advised panegyrists. In view of his environment it must be\r\nadmitted there is a strong _prima facie_ probability that he or any other\r\nElizabethan official was a thief; ‘the spacious times of Great Elizabeth’\r\nincluded much more than literary excellence, colonising genius, and naval\r\nsuccess. Sufficient evidence has been given in this work to show the low\r\nstandard existing among all ranks of naval officials, and more, relating\r\nto other classes of society, could be extracted from the State Papers.\r\nThe court was proverbially corrupt, and a recent writer[1547] gives\r\nstriking illustrations of the lax morality characterising all grades of\r\nthe Elizabethan social system.\r\n\r\nIt was said that Hawkyns neither built nor repaired the ships according\r\nto his contract, that he used old cables and rotten oakum, that he\r\nblackmailed shipwrights and workmen, and that he was in partnership\r\nwith a private builder, in whose yard he built ships for himself with\r\ngovernment timber, and fitted them out with government stores. If these\r\nthings were true the whole naval administration must have been in a state\r\nin which the least strain would have brought it down in ruin, but the\r\nmore serious allegations are sufficiently disproved[1548] by the fact\r\nthat when the fate of England depended on the condition of the fleet, it\r\nwas found, in the hour of need, to be absolutely efficient in all the\r\nmany details for which Hawkyns was responsible. If, however, we are to\r\nsuppose that he confined his malpractices to matters not likely to injure\r\nthe _matériel_ of the Navy, it can only be remarked that they can have\r\nbeen but very small in extent, and that fraudulent officials are not\r\nusually so considerately and judiciously patriotic. In considering what\r\nmay or may not have been true, it is only fair to Hawkyns to emphasise\r\nthe fact that these anonymous indictments—and many of those urged against\r\nhim were anonymous—were levelled against nearly every person holding an\r\nadministrative position in the service of the crown; delation, whether\r\nreligious, political, or social, was a recognised occupation requiring\r\nno capital, offering the possibility of large rewards, and welcome to\r\nthe government and the Queen. Hawkyns, when he was appointed, made a\r\nclean sweep of many naval abuses of long standing, and had certainly\r\nmade enemies in Sir William Wynter[1549] and others, with whom at least\r\none informer,[1550] who also had personal reasons for disliking the\r\nTreasurer, appears to have been on very friendly terms.\r\n\r\nHawkyns not only received no help from his brother Officers, but had\r\nto contend with their open or secret hostility.[1551] Wynter was the\r\nperson to whom everyone who had a grievance against Hawkyns, went for\r\nhelp and advice; and if we may judge of Wynter’s hopes and intentions\r\nby his capacity for treachery he must have been a dangerous antagonist.\r\nIn 1585, he wrote to Burghley, of Hawkyns and his work, ‘As I desier\r\ncompfort in Gods handes there is nothinge in it but cunninge and crafte\r\nto maynteine his pride and ambision and for the better fillinge of his\r\npurse ... he careth not to whom he speaketh nor what he sayeth, blushe\r\nhe will not.’[1552] But in 1587, he wrote,[1553] ‘Wee are thorowlye\r\nperswaded in our conscience that he hath for the time since he took that\r\nbargaine[1554] expended a farre greater somme in carpentrie uppon her\r\nMajesties shippes then he hath had eny wage allowance for;’ the moorings,\r\nshipkeepers’, and clerks’ wages, ‘have byn payde and sufficientlye done\r\nby him.’ As a commentary on this last letter, we have a statement of the\r\nsame year, not it is true, by Wynter, but by Wynter’s servant, that the\r\nfriendship now shown was only a pretence, and that ‘You knowe howe many\r\nwayes my master hath sought against him and could never prevaile and\r\ntherefore he closeth with him to catch him at a suer advantage.’[1555]\r\nAs Surveyor Wynter was a brother Officer of equal rank, and nearly equal\r\npower, with whom Hawkyns had to work. But putting aside any criticism of\r\nthe code of honour here shown, it may fairly be asked why should Wynter\r\nhave displayed this eagerness to ruin Hawkyns, at all costs and by any\r\nmeans. There could be only one of two reasons; either an honest desire to\r\nsave the Queen and state from deceit and robbery, or a selfish desire\r\nto regain the position and perquisites of which the reforms initiated by\r\nHawkyns, and the latter’s masterful personality had deprived him. I do\r\nnot think that any student of Elizabethan history will hesitate as to\r\nwhich reason moved him. As for Borough, he wrote to Burghley, in 1584,\r\nthat Hawkyns deserved hanging; but that did not prevent his joining\r\nWynter in the letter of 1587, doubtless with the same intentions.[1556]\r\nIn another paper of 1587, and endorsed by Burghley as being by Thos.\r\nAllen, the writer, after a long arraignment, kindly offers to undertake\r\nHawkyns’ duties.[1557] It is an extremely important fact that most of\r\nthese men obviously hoped to gain some personal advantages by displacing\r\nhim. Allen was ‘Queen’s merchant,’ or purchaser of Dantzic cordage\r\nand, according to another informer, had been so friendly with Hawkyns\r\nas to receive a bribe of £60 from him out of the first contract of\r\n1579.[1558] He eventually quarrelled with the other Officers he was now\r\nsupporting, and in 1592, complained of them to Burghley. The internal\r\nhistory of the Navy Office at this period is a perfect maze of intrigue,\r\nand there was not one of these men who, at some time, was not doing\r\nhis best to supplant others with whom before and afterwards he was, or\r\nbecame, friendly, perhaps to quarrel again in due course. No doubt the\r\nappointment of Hawkyns was regarded as a piece of family jobbery, and,\r\nas a fact, was very likely more due to influence than merit. By both\r\nseniority and reputation Wynter had, in 1578, a much better claim to such\r\nan important post.\r\n\r\nThat Hawkyns used his official position to obtain discounts, commission\r\non contracts, and other such emoluments, is quite possible; such things\r\nare not unknown even now, are distinct from deliberate embezzlement, and\r\nwould hardly be condemned by public opinion in the sixteenth century. It\r\ncan hardly be made an article of accusation against him that he became a\r\nwealthy man, even if there were much left after the expenses were paid\r\nof his last unlucky voyage. The yearly fee of the Treasurer was not\r\nlarge—£220, 18s 4d, out of which he had to pay his travelling expenses\r\nwhen on the Queen’s service—and it was expected and permitted, in both\r\nhis contracts, that he should keep any outstanding balance as profit,\r\nprovided the work was properly done; and there was nothing in the ethics\r\nof his position, as then understood, debarring him from shipping and\r\nother mercantile transactions. The best proof that both Elizabeth and\r\nBurghley were satisfied that his gains were not too great lies in the\r\nfact that both contracts were determined at his own request, and that,\r\nnotwithstanding his supposed peculations, their knowledge of them, and\r\nthe efforts made to remove him, he held his post till the day of his\r\ndeath. He is accused of being in partnership with Richard Chapman, the\r\nmaster shipwright. Chapman appears to have had a private yard, but there\r\nis no warrant for the precise statement beyond the words of another\r\nanonymous writer that he ‘used Richard Chapman’s yard.’[1559] There\r\nis no guide to the year or years in which he is said to have had work\r\ndone by Chapman. This man did not become a crown shipwright till about\r\n1582, and it may very well be that Hawkyns employed him before he was\r\ntaken into the service of the crown. Another reflection is that in these\r\ntransactions with Chapman there must have been witnesses, in the shape\r\nof workmen and others, not one of whom was ever brought forward. In all\r\nthese papers we are only given the statements of the writers; there is\r\nnever a suggestion of corroborative evidence. The anonymous writer just\r\nquoted says, among many other things, that the ships are in such bad\r\ncondition that ‘they are brought to their last end and dangerous state.’\r\nThis was in October 1587, and the events of the next year proved that\r\nto be a peculiarly unfortunate assertion. This particular delator was\r\nignorant of that necessity for verisimilitude which is one of the first\r\nrequirements of his business. He charges Hawkyns with illicit profits\r\non the remains of victuals returned from sea, not apparently knowing\r\nthat the Navy Treasurer had as little connection with, and as little\r\ncontrol over, the victualling as over Westminster Abbey. Again, he goes\r\non to say, ‘the shipwrights are his instruments to serve his purpose\r\nand cloak for his dissembling,’ and thereupon it is to be observed that\r\nsome of these writers represent him as sharing dishonest gain with the\r\nshipwrights, while others pathetically deplore the shipwrights’ hard fate\r\nin being subjected to his terrorism; some represent him as quarrelling\r\nwith the men with whom others maintain he was secretly in league for\r\nunderhand purposes. We know, however, that Hawkyns possessed vessels of\r\nhis own and the circumstance that he had them repaired in a private yard,\r\nwhen he might have used the government slips is really a strong point in\r\nhis favour, although used by his enemies as the basis of truth on which\r\nto build up the liberal superstructure of ‘unjust and deceitful dealings.’\r\n\r\nIt is said that, although there was no formal inquiry made into the truth\r\nof the allegations against Hawkyns, Burghley satisfied himself that they\r\nwere not unfounded, and drew up a set of stringent regulations intended\r\nto prevent their recurrence, noting on the rough draft, ‘Remembrance\r\nof abuses past, John Hawkyns was half in the bargain with Peter Pett\r\nand Mathew Baker.’ Nothing exists but this rough draft[1560] which\r\nincludes notes relating to the other Officers as well as to Hawkyns, to\r\nshipwrights, and a memorandum on the increased scale of wages recently\r\ncome into operation. There is no evidence that any inquiry was held,\r\nother than which took shape in the explanations Hawkyns offered in\r\nhis numerous letters to Burghley still existing. Moreover if these\r\nregulations were issued with an especial reference to Hawkyns it is to be\r\nnoticed that it would be his duty as the chief administrative Officer of\r\nthe Navy to enforce them and apply them to himself. Was Burghley usually\r\nso confiding?\r\n\r\nIn January 1587-8 Pett and Baker were called upon to report on the\r\nsecond contract and how far it had been accomplished.[1561] Their\r\nreport was unfavourable, but it will be remembered that, by this second\r\n‘bargain,’ Hawkyns had undertaken, at a cheaper rate, the work they\r\ndid under the first one, and reduced them from an independent to a\r\nsubordinate position.[1562] Their feeling in the matter is shown by the\r\nway they dealt with the third article, on the repair of ships, which\r\nHawkyns had taken out of their hands. They remarked that it was done\r\nbetter before—that is when they were doing it—‘for before the master\r\nshipwrights did direct but now they are to be directed.’ This was the\r\ngrievance. Not only were they both displaced competitors, but Baker had\r\nlong been connected with the Wynter faction; and Pett and Hawkyns had,\r\nin 1587, fallen ‘at variance upon accomptes.’ In 1585 Pett had joined\r\nHawkyns in condemning Baker; now his interests brought him into line\r\nwith Baker.[1563] Burghley cannot have believed that, in 1587 at any\r\nrate, Hawkyns was in confederacy with these two men, or it is hardly\r\nlikely that they would immediately afterwards have been chosen to sit in\r\njudgment upon him, especially as Burghley must have known that Pett was\r\na new, and Baker an old enemy. Further, there is a curious similarity\r\nbetween Burghley’s note and a passage in Allen’s attack before referred\r\nto,—‘Mathew Baker sayeth that when Peter Pett and he did the repayringe\r\nof her Maties Shippes Hawkyns would needes be hallfe with them.’ The\r\nresemblance between Burghley and Allen suggests the possibility that the\r\nformer paraphrased his note from the latter without independent inquiry;\r\nbut, in any case, it may be pointed out that it is an indirect report of\r\nwhat Baker said, that according to this account Baker permitted himself\r\nto be blackmailed although he had for years been at enmity with Hawkyns,\r\nand that he concealed his woes from all his superiors until he poured\r\nthem into the sympathetic ear of Mr Allen. There was nothing to prevent\r\nhis petitioning Burghley as everyone else did; and it is still more\r\nstrange that, so far as we know, he was never called up and examined on\r\nthis statement made to Allen. The two lines in Burghley’s handwriting\r\ncomprise in truth the only evidence of any weight against Hawkyns, but\r\nthey are mysterious as they stand for they imply that he put himself\r\nin the power of avowed enemies, and we are left quite ignorant of the\r\nproofs—if there were any—on which they are based, or how far Burghley\r\nsubsequently modified his opinion. That he did so modify it, or perhaps\r\naltogether change it, is, I think, proved by the letter quoted _supra_\r\np. 147. There is significance in the fact that, so far as rivals and\r\ninferiors were concerned, these attacks practically ceased after 1588; it\r\nmust have become known that Burghley no longer received them trustingly.\r\n\r\nThe supervision Elizabeth exercised over his accounts, the ‘mystrust’\r\nof which he complained, has been attributed to the good reason she\r\nhad for doubting his integrity. That Elizabeth haggled over his\r\naccounts proves nothing by itself, for it would be difficult to name\r\nany one of her officials whose figures were not subjected to the same\r\nsuspicions and distrustful scrutiny. But it has yet to be shown that\r\nhis contemporaries, other than the subordinates whose perquisites he\r\nhad extinguished, and the rivals whom he had displaced, doubted his\r\nintegrity. Sir Robert Mansell is quoted as saying that Hawkyns combined\r\n‘malice in dissimulation, rudeness in behaviour, and was covetous in\r\nthe last degree.’ Hawkyns may have been rude—he was not so successful\r\nat court as Mansell, though he was more successful at sea. But, without\r\ngoing into Mansell’s value, as a witness—and he, on evidence of a very\r\ndifferent order, has been shown to have stolen hugely as Treasurer—it\r\nwill be noticed that, although moved by evident animus, he makes no\r\naccusation of dishonesty. Again, Sir Robert Cotton in his report (1608)\r\non the then abuses of naval administration has, in referring to previous\r\nconditions, occasion to mention Hawkyns frequently, and invariably takes\r\nthe period of his control as a standard during which the business of the\r\nNavy was well and honestly done. Monson’s opinion is important as that of\r\nan undoubtedly competent and trustworthy observer, and one of unstained\r\nrepute as a commander. He commenced his naval career in 1588, so that it\r\nwas in part contemporaneous. He desires, when criticising the Navy Office\r\nof the reign of Charles I, to ‘bring it to the state of Hawkyn’s and\r\nBurrough’s time who were perfect and honest men in their places, the one\r\nTreasurer and the other Comptroller.’[1564] There is matter for further\r\nconsideration in the circumstance that all the men who depose against\r\nHawkyns—Peter Pett, Baker, Wynter, Mansell, Sir Peter Buck, the writers\r\nin the State Papers and the _Lansdowne MSS._—are persons of tarnished\r\nhonesty, or interested motives, and at least four of them known to have\r\nbeen his personal enemies; while on the other side we have Cotton,\r\nMonson, Nottingham, and—after 1588—Burghley, witnesses of very different\r\nforce. In the absence of a verdict proceeding from a judicial inquiry,\r\ntheir evidence must be allowed more weight than that made up of the stabs\r\nof anonymous slanderers, jealous rivals, and envious subordinates.\r\n\r\nHawkyns was doubtless a rough, masterful man, readier with the iron hand\r\nthan with the velvet glove, more popular with the seamen whose ranks he\r\nhad left than with the officials whose ranks he had joined. He was not\r\na great man, but his services to England were great, and entitle him to\r\nkindly consideration at the hands of all Englishmen. But, before branding\r\nhis memory with the stain of systematic fraud, it is well to examine\r\nclosely the doubtful shreds and tatters of scandal on the strength of\r\nwhich he is to be condemned, or—worse still—offered the contemptuous\r\ncharity of condonation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX D\r\n\r\nA PRIVATEER OF 1592\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two prizes taken by the _Amity_ were the _St Francisco_ of 130, and\r\nthe _St Peter_ of 150 tons, laden with 112 tons of quicksilver, and\r\n28 tons of Bulls, 1,458,000 in number, for ‘lyvinge bodyes’ and ‘dead\r\nbodyes,’ which were to be sold in New Spain at two reals apiece. The\r\nships also carried some wine, and the freightage paid to the owners was\r\n40 ducats a ton. The armament of the _St Peter_ is not given, but was\r\nprobably little more than that of the _St Francisco_ which carried[1565]\r\nthree iron guns, two copper pieces of 20 quintals[1566] each, and one\r\nof 14 quintals. There were 90 round, and 40 chain shot for these guns\r\nwith nine quintals of powder. Twenty muskets, and other arms of offence\r\nand defence, were also carried. Her crew numbered 28 men and two boys\r\nand she was licensed to take twenty passengers; if therefore 126 living\r\npersons were found in the two ships after the action, the _St Peter_ must\r\nhave furnished a much larger proportion or there must have been, as was\r\ncommon enough, a number of unlicensed passengers.[1567] If a loss of two\r\nkilled and three wounded, in an action lasting five hours and with two\r\nantagonists, was an ordinary one, fighting at sea cannot be considered,\r\nin view of the normal mortality from disease on shore in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, to have added materially to the risks of life.\r\n\r\nAccording to Malyne[1568] these Bulls were laded by Sixtus V. When they\r\ncame to England Dr Lopez, the Queen’s physician, who was afterwards\r\nexecuted on a charge of being concerned in a plot to murder her, obtained\r\nthem by purchase or as a gift. He and a partner started them again for\r\nthe West Indies but the Pope’s agent stopped their sale, alleging that\r\nthey had lost their virtue by having been in heretic possession. The\r\nfactor representing Lopez, not to be outdone, said that they had been\r\nmiraculously saved, but the speculation was a failure.\r\n\r\n                       LANSDOWNE MSS., 70-23\r\n\r\n    The ordre and mannour of the takinge of the twoo Shippes laden\r\n    with Quicksilver and the Pope’s bulles bound for the West Indas\r\n    by the _Amitie_ of London, Master, Thomas Whytte.\r\n\r\n    The 26th of July 1592 beinge in 36 degrees[1569] or\r\n    thereaboutes, about 4 of the clocke in the morninge, wee had\r\n    sight of the said Shippes beinge distaunte ffrom us about 3\r\n    or 4 leagues; by 7 of the cloke we ffeatched them up and were\r\n    within goonn shotte whose boldnes (havinge the kinges armes\r\n    dysplaide) did make us conceave them rather to be ships of\r\n    warr then laden with merchandize. And as yt dothe appeare by\r\n    some of theire owne Speeches they made full accompte to have\r\n    taken us, and was Question amongst them whyther they should\r\n    carrye us to St Lucar or Lishebonn. Wee wayfed eche other\r\n    amaine,[1570] they havinge placed themselves in warlyke ordre,\r\n    thone a cabolles lenght before thoother, we begonne the fight\r\n    in the which we continued so faste as we were able to chardge\r\n    and dyschardge the space of fyve houres, being never a cabells\r\n    lenght dystaunte eyther of us the one from the other, in which\r\n    tyme wee receaved divers shottes both in the hull of our ship,\r\n    mastes and sayles, to the number of xxxii greate shotte which\r\n    we told after the ffighte, besydes fyve hundreed muskett\r\n    shotte and harquebuye acroke[1571] at the least. And for that\r\n    wee perceaved they were stoute, we thought good to boorde\r\n    the byskaine[1572] which was a heade the other, where lyinge\r\n    aboord aboute an houre plyinge our ordenaunce and small shotte\r\n    with the which we stowed[1573] all his men; now they in the\r\n    flybotte makinge accompte that wee had entreed our menn, bare\r\n    Roome[1574] with us, meaninge to have laide us aboorde, and so\r\n    to have entrapped us betwene them both, which we perceavinge,\r\n    made redy ordenaunce and fytted us, so as wee quitted ourselves\r\n    of him, and he boorded his ffelowe, by which meanes they\r\n    both fell from us. Then presently we kepte our looffe,[1575]\r\n    hoysed our topsayles, and weathered them, and came hard aboord\r\n    the flibotte with our ordenaunce prepared, and gave her our\r\n    whole broadeside with the which wee slewe divers of theire\r\n    menn, so as wee might perceave the bloud to Runne out at the\r\n    Scoopers; after that wee caste aboute, and new chardged all our\r\n    ordenaunce and came upon them againe and wylled them Amaine,\r\n    or else wee would synke them, whereupon the one would have\r\n    yelded which was shotte betweene wind and watter, but the other\r\n    called him traytour; unto whom we mad answere that if he wold\r\n    not yeld presently also we would synke him first. And thereupon\r\n    he undrestaundinge our determinacon, presently put out a whyt\r\n    fflagg and yelded, howbeyt they refused to stryke theire owne\r\n    Sayles, for that they were sworne never to stryke to any\r\n    Englishmann. Wee then commaunded the captaines and masters to\r\n    come aboorde of us which they dyd and after examinacon and\r\n    stowinge them, wee sent aboord them, strooke theire sayles and\r\n    manned theire shipps, findinge in them bothe one hundreed and\r\n    twenty and six soules lyvinge, and eight deade, besides those\r\n    which they themselves had caste overboorde, so yt pleased God\r\n    to geve us the victorye, being but 42 menn and a boye, of the\r\n    which ther were two killed and three wounded, ffor which good\r\n    succeasse wee geve the onely prayse to Allmightye God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] _United Service Magazine_, October 1880.\r\n\r\n[2] But that the public have yet much to learn was shown by the ignorant\r\ncomplacency, ludicrous if it were not so dangerous, with which the\r\nmobilisation of six ships and six destroyers was received in January,\r\nafter twelve days of official and some weeks of unofficial preparation.\r\n\r\n[3] The history of the early navy till 1423, will be found treated\r\nminutely by Sir N. H. Nicolas in the _History of the Royal Navy_,\r\nLond. 1847, a work of great research. Here, down to that date, points\r\nleft somewhat obscure by Nicolas, or upon which more than one view is\r\npossible, are shortly touched upon.\r\n\r\n[4] According to some writers, the organisation of the Cinque Ports dates\r\nfrom before the Conquest; it was not, however, until after that event\r\nthat their services became of national importance.\r\n\r\n[5] R. G. Marsden, _Select pleas of the Court of Admiralty_, Selden Soc.\r\n1894.\r\n\r\n[6] The mention of the word galley in the records is, taken by itself,\r\noften misleading. Frequently it meant a small, but fully rigged, sailing\r\nvessel, supplied with sweeps for occasional use. Sometimes it appears\r\nto have been applied to a sailing ship of particular build, and on one\r\noccasion the _Mary Rose_, a ‘capital ship’ of Henry VIII, is called ‘the\r\ngreat galley,’ showing how loosely the word was used.\r\n\r\n[7]\r\n\r\n    ‘For foure things our Noble sheweth to me\r\n    King, Ship, and Swerd, and power of the See.’\r\n\r\n_Libel of English Policie_, supposed to be by De Moleyns, Bishop of\r\nChichester, and written in 1436 or 1437.\r\n\r\n[8] That his subjects at one time called him the ‘King of the Sea,’ shows\r\nhow the fact of his having been the first English king to command a naval\r\nbattle impressed popular imagination; towards the end of the reign the\r\nphrase must have sounded bitter in the ears of the inhabitants of the\r\ncoast towns.\r\n\r\n[9] King and sword were not new on coins, and the ship was usual enough\r\non the seals of the port towns; in them, as doubtless in the noble, it\r\nreferred to mercantile traffic.\r\n\r\n[10] ‘The shifty, untrustworthy statecraft of an unprincipled,\r\nlight-hearted king, living for his own ends, and recking not of what came\r\nafter him.’ (Stubbs, _Const. Hist._ ii, 510).\r\n\r\n[11] _Rot. Parl._ ii, 311, 319.\r\n\r\n[12] The expression ‘ton-tight’ is somewhat obscure, but probably meant\r\ncomplete or measured tons. (Cf. Holloway, _Dict. of Provincialisms_, s.v.\r\n_tight_, and Halliwell’s _Dictionary_ s.v. _thite_.) In Latin papers it\r\nis rendered by such a form as ships ‘ponderis 80 doliorum;’ in 1430 it\r\nis described as ‘le tonage autrement appelle tounetight,’ (_Exchequer\r\nWarrants for Issues_, 9 Feb). It was not necessarily restricted to ship\r\nmeasurement since, in 1496, stone and gravel for dock building were being\r\npurchased by the ton-tight. It is therefore possible that it referred to\r\nweight as distinguished from the cubic space occupied by a tun of wine,\r\nthe original standard of tonnage capacity.\r\n\r\n[13] At various times, from the thirteenth to the first quarter of the\r\nsixteenth century, the phrases, ‘of Westminster,’ ‘of the Tower,’ and\r\n‘of Greenwich,’ were successively equivalent to the later ‘H.M.S.’ The\r\nmeaning, here, is that there were 150 vessels fit for use as men-of-war.\r\n\r\n[14] _Ancient Petitions_, 5477 (R.O.) ‘A tsnobles et tssages seigneurs\r\ndiceste present parlement supplient tres humblement toutz les\r\npossessoures des niefs dedens ceste roialme q come en le temps du noble\r\nRoi Edward et ces predecessours q a chescun fois qaunt ascun nief furent\r\nordeigne de faire ascun viage q le possessour de tiel nief prendrent del\r\nton-tight 40d en le quart par regard damender la nief a lappaill dicell\r\net la quart part del prise par eux fait sur la mer par quelle regard\r\nla naveie diceste roialme alors fust bien mayntene et governe si q a\r\nicelle temps furent tondez prestz dens la roialme 150 niefs del Toure et\r\npuis la deces du noble roi Edward en le temps de Richard nadgaiez roi\r\nDengleterre le dit regard eston demenise jesqs 11s le ton-tight et cci\r\nestee tsmalement paie si q les possessours des tielx niefs mount ils null\r\nvolunte de sustener et mayntener lour niefs mais ils onct lesses giser\r\ndesolat pur quel cause la navie diceste roialme est ency dimennise et\r\nempeire q ne soienct en tout la roialme outre 25 niefs del Tour.’\r\n\r\n[15] _Le Compte du Clos des Galées_, 1382-4.

R. Green’s, _Town Life in the Fifteenth Century_.\r\n\r\n[19] There was a contemptuous Continental saying, ‘We buy the foxskins\r\nfrom the English for a groat, and resell them the foxes’ tails for a\r\nguilder,’ which is expressive enough.\r\n\r\n[20] _Exch.

This must be\r\na mistake on the part of the Treasury clerk. The 1000 tons of the _Jesus\r\nof the Tower_ seems very suspicious, but as in nearly every instance, the\r\ntonnage is only once given there is no opportunity for collation.\r\n\r\n[21] Rebuilt.\r\n\r\n[22] With the exception of the _Agase_ taken in Southampton water; a\r\nFrench fleet having visited the English coast in May, before the Duke was\r\nready for sea.\r\n\r\n[23] Spanish, _ballenere_, long low vessels for oars and sails introduced\r\nin the fourteenth century by the Biscayan builders (Fernandez Duro, _La\r\nMarina de Castilla_ p. 158.)\r\n\r\n[24] _Rot.

Nicolas says\r\n(Introduction, vol. v, cxxxvi), that the whole of the navy was ordered to\r\nbe sold, but the wording of the entry does not support this authoritative\r\nstatement. The later records prove clearly that they were not all sold;\r\nbut whether because no such wholesale clearance had been intended, or\r\nfrom want of purchasers, there is no conclusive evidence to show.\r\n\r\n[32]\r\n\r\n    Where bene our shippes?\r\n    Where bene our swerdes become?\r\n    Our enemies bid for the shippe sette a shepe,\r\n    Allas oure reule halteth, hit is benome;\r\n    Who dare wel say that lordeshippe should take kepe?\r\n    I will asaye thoughe mine herte ginne to wepe,\r\n    To doe thys werke yf wee wole ever the (thrive)\r\n    For very shame to kepe aboute the see.’\r\n\r\nIf Adam de Moleyns was the author his death by violence at the hands of\r\nseamen, in 1450, had an especially tragic unfitness.\r\n\r\n[33] ‘Per contrarotulacionem.’\r\n\r\n[34] _Exch.

She was built in or before 1536, captured by the\r\nScotch, and described as English in a Scotch fleet, (_Ibid._ xi, 631);\r\nrecaptured by Lord Clynton in Sept. 1547, and resumed her place in the\r\nEnglish navy (Holinshed, p. 989).\r\n\r\n[178] First mentioned _Letters and Papers_, 31st Dec. 1539.\r\n\r\n[179] Or _Mathew Gonson_; first mentioned 10th June 1539.\r\n\r\n[180] First mentioned 10th June 1539; an entirely different vessel from\r\nthe preceding of the same name.\r\n\r\n[181] Or _Less Bark_ and _Great Bark_.

According to _Add.

Probably the\r\n‘great shallop’ in building (_Letters and Papers_) 19th Apr. that year.\r\n\r\n[197] _Ibid._ Probably the ‘great galleon’ building at Smalhithe on 19th\r\nApril. There was a _Grand Mistress_ in the French navy at this time.\r\n\r\n[198] _Ibid._ Probably the ‘second galleon’ building at Smalhithe on 19th\r\nApril.\r\n\r\n[199] _Ibid._ Probably the ‘new gallyot’ building at Deptford 19th April.\r\n\r\n[200] _Ibid._ Probably the ‘middle shallop’ building at Deptford 19th\r\nApril. Saker was the name of a piece of ordnance or of the peregrine hawk.\r\n\r\n[201] _Ibid._ Probably the ‘small shallop’ building at Dover on 19th\r\nApril.\r\n\r\n[202] _Ibid._ Probably the ‘less Spanish pinnace’ of 19th April.\r\n\r\n[203] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[204] _Ibid._ Captured by the French 2nd Sept. 1547 (Stow p. 594).\r\n\r\n[205] _Ibid._ Of Dantzic.\r\n\r\n[206] Captured from the French 18th May (Stow).\r\n\r\n[207] First mentioned _Letters and Papers_, Mar. 1546. Of Bremen.\r\n\r\n[208] The _Phœnix_ and the _George_ are first mentioned as royal ships in\r\nAnthony’s list of 1546; probably merchantmen of those names in the list\r\nof 10th Aug. 1545, and bought into the service.\r\n\r\n[209] The _Antelope_, _Tiger_, _Bull_ and _Hart_ first occur in Anthony’s\r\nlist of the navy in 1546; in that year (_Letters and Papers_, Mar. 1546,\r\nuncalendared) there were ‘the four new ships a making at Deptford 1000\r\ntons,’ with which tonnage these correspond.\r\n\r\n[210] Twenty tons each.\r\n\r\n[211] As in the case of the _Mary Rose_, (_King’s Book of Payments_).\r\n\r\n[212] _State Papers, Spain_, ii, 144.\r\n\r\n[213] Fernandez Duro, _Disquisiciones Nauticas_, Lib. V, 11, 354. The\r\nSpanish ship ton, or ‘tonelada de arqueo,’ was rather smaller than the\r\nEnglish; ‘esta tonelada de arqueo es un espacio de 8 codos cúbicos cada\r\ncodo tiene 33 dedos ó pulgadas de 48 que tiene la vara de Castilla,’\r\n(_Ibid._ p. 161, quoting Veitia). This works out at 53.44 cubic feet\r\nagainst the 60 cubic feet allowed in the fifteenth and sixteenth century\r\nEnglish ships. The measurement by tonelada was Sevillean, or South\r\nSpanish; the Biscayan builders calculated by the tonel, ten of which\r\nequalled twelve toneladas (Fernandez de Navarrete, _Coleccion de Viages_\r\nII, 86).\r\n\r\n[214] Lodge, _Illustrations of British History_, i, 14.\r\n\r\n[215] See Appendix A.\r\n\r\n[216] _State Papers_, (1830), 6th Aug. 1545.\r\n\r\n[217] _Chapter House Bks._ vol. vi.\r\n\r\n[218] _Ibid._ vol. xiii. It should be stated that these figures are from\r\nan inventory of stores and fittings remaining on board the ships in 1515,\r\nand do not necessarily represent the full equipment. They may, however,\r\nbe taken to indicate its distribution.\r\n\r\n[219] It has been mentioned that the weight of the serpentine was about\r\n250 lbs.; double serpentines were presumably heavier. Serpentines and\r\nother small pieces were fitted with one or two removable chambers for\r\nloading.\r\n\r\n[220] All that is known of slings is that they were ‘bigge peces of ship\r\nordenance,’ (_Letters and Papers_, uncalendared, 1542). ‘Bigge’ must be\r\nunderstood relatively as they were fired with chambers.\r\n\r\n[221] The French _Pierrier_, used for stone shot.\r\n\r\n[222] Murderers, half a century later, were small swivel guns, but at\r\nthis date perhaps larger. These two are described as ‘two grete murderers\r\nof brasse.’\r\n\r\n[223] According to another paper (_Letters and Papers_, i, 5721) the\r\nupper forecastle deck carried eight serpentines and eight smaller guns.\r\n\r\n[224] She also had six serpentines and a stone gun in the main and mizen\r\ntops. In the fifteenth century darts were flung from the tops; now most\r\nlarge vessels carried guns in them.\r\n\r\n[225] _Letters and Papers_, i, 5721.\r\n\r\n[226] _Ibid._ and _Chapt. House Bks._, vol. xiii. Eighty-four guns\r\naccording to the latter.\r\n\r\n[227] Low Latin _petra_, stone shot; the name subsequently defined a\r\nparticular weight or shape, and remained in use although iron shot were\r\nfired from what was still called a stone cannon.\r\n\r\n[228] _Add.

This is the only instance, so far\r\nas is yet known, in which ships carried them as part of their equipment,\r\nand here probably it was only in connection with the invasion of France.\r\n\r\n[231] Armour.\r\n\r\n[232] It should be noticed that when these schedules were drawn up,\r\nthe _Henry_ was not yet launched, the figures therefore were purely\r\nconjectural and not requisites shown by experience to be necessary.\r\n\r\n[233] _Letters and Papers_, i, 5276; the _Peter Pomegranate_.

There was no difference\r\nmade, in building, between merchantmen and men-of-war, and in 1584 Martin\r\nde Recalde petitioned to be allowed to fly the royal standard because\r\nwithout it his fleet would be taken for merchantmen. In return for the\r\nlarge bounty given and the advances made to builders the crown seized\r\ntheir vessels on every occasion and for every purpose where, in England,\r\nthe royal ships would have been employed. The system was the same as that\r\nby which Edward III had destroyed English shipping. In 1601 the Duke\r\nof Medina Sidonia wrote plainly that the remedy for the impoverishment\r\nfallen on Spanish shipowners was ‘that the King should build the vessels\r\nhe required and not take them from private individuals, ruining them.’\r\nIn the fleet of the Marquis of Santa Cruz at Terceira in 1583 only three\r\nbelonged to the crown, and in the Armada only twenty-five. Sometimes\r\ncontracts were made with admirals who undertook to serve with a certain\r\nnumber of ships, and at other times with towns who engaged to supply\r\nthem. There was no Admiralty as in England. There had been an Admiral\r\nof Castile from the beginning of the thirteenth century, but the civil\r\nportion of his duties was confined to the headship of the courts of\r\nlaw deputed to hear maritime causes. If a fleet or squadron was to be\r\nequipped officials, who may or may not have had previous experience,\r\nwere temporarily entrusted with the duty at the various ports and their\r\nfunctions ceased with the completion of their work (Fernandez Duro, _La\r\nArmada Invencible_; _Disquisiciones Nauticas_, Lib.

The _Bom Jesus_ was lost in the Mozambique\r\nChannel with all on board, the _Bartholomeu_ parted company about the\r\nsame time and was never heard of again, the _Santa Cruz_ was run ashore\r\nand burnt to prevent capture. Nor was the total loss of a Portuguese or\r\nSpanish squadron, from various causes, at all remarkable. The captain\r\nof the _Madre de Dios_, Fernando de Mendoza, had been master of Medina\r\nSidonia’s flagship in 1588; his maritime interviews with the English must\r\nhave become a veritable nightmare to him. The Fuggers of Augsburg, to\r\nwhom the cargo was hypothecated, are said to have been the real losers by\r\nthe capture, as it was probably not insured. It was difficult to insure\r\nSpanish ships at this time. In 1587 a Spaniard wrote of a vessel in the\r\nWest Indies, ‘I have not assured any part thereof and at this present I\r\ndo not find any that will assure at any price’ (_Lansd. MSS._, 53, f.\r\n21). The conditions had become much more unfavourable to Spanish seaborne\r\ncommerce by 1592.\r\n\r\n[759] _Lansd. MSS._, 73, f. 38.\r\n\r\n[760] _Harl. MSS._, 598.\r\n\r\n[761] _Lansd. MSS._ 73, f. 38.

When the _Pelican_, or as she\r\nwas afterwards called, the _Golden Hind_, returned from her famous\r\nvoyage round the world she was placed in a dock, filled in with earth at\r\nDeptford, and remained there as one of the shows of London for nearly a\r\ncentury. There is an estimate for works to the amount of £370 for this\r\npurpose (_Add. MSS._ 9294, f. 68), but it does not appear that this plan,\r\nwhich included a brick wall, roof, etc., was ever fully carried out.

Charles’s sad and picturesque dignity of appearance did not\r\nimply such a delicate sense of honour as to prevent him turning a penny\r\nby forcing contraband of war through the fleet of a friendly power and\r\nsupplying the privateers who were the scourge of English commerce.\r\n\r\n[1032] In the eighteenth century he would have had a hole-and-corner\r\ntrial, undefended and ignorant of the law, before the associates, and\r\nperhaps friends, of the man whom he had assaulted.\r\n\r\n[1033] _State Papers, Dom._, lvi, 101, (1627), and ccccvii, 32, (1638).\r\n\r\n[1034] _State Papers, Dom._, ccccxxxi, 30.\r\n\r\n[1035] With the exception of the Amboyna affair, a case once more of\r\nthe ‘prancing proconsul,’ the Dutch showed, throughout this century,\r\nexemplary patience and moderation under a long course of provocation,\r\nin affairs of salutes, right of search, and seizures of ships, several\r\ninstances of which there will be occasion to mention. The rulers of the\r\nUnited Netherlands chose to consider wider aims and more urgent needs\r\nthan revenge for insults to their flag, however flagrant, but when the\r\nNavigation Act of 1651 brought matters to a crisis the Dutch must have\r\nfelt that they had a long score to settle.\r\n\r\n[1036] _State Papers, Dom._, cccclxxxii, 13.\r\n\r\n[1037] _State Papers, Dom._, ccccxciv, 2nd Jan. 1643.\r\n\r\n[1038] Public Acts, 17th Charles I.\r\n\r\n[1039] Preface to _Calendar of State Papers_, 1652-3, p. xii.

The _Speedwell_ was lost in November 1624, after\r\nthis list was drawn up. There were also some worn out Elizabethan ships\r\nremaining, the _Crane_, _Answer_, _Moon_, and _Merlin_, which the\r\ncompiler did not consider of sufficient importance to include.\r\n\r\n[1069] _Pipe Office Accounts_, 2425.\r\n\r\n[1070] _State Papers, Dom._, lxvii, 47.\r\n\r\n[1071] _Pipe Office Accounts_, 2428.\r\n\r\n[1072] E.g. the _Sovereign of the Seas_, which, until she was cut down,\r\nwas the largest most ornate, and most useless ship afloat.\r\n\r\n[1073] _State Papers, Dom._, lxxi, 65. These remarks must be read in\r\nconjunction with those relating to the lack of victuals and stores, and\r\nwant of competent and willing service on the part of officers and men,\r\nmade in Part I, and for which Buckingham’s incapacity was principally\r\nresponsible. But his incapacity was, in this matter, not the only nor\r\neven the main factor, since, when in 1627 he applied to Gyffard, Sir\r\nSackville Trevor, and Hervey for suggestions as to freeing the narrow\r\nseas from pirates, they agreed that the existing vessels were too slow\r\nto catch any but others of their own type (_State Papers, Dom._, liv, 9,\r\n11-13). In October 1625, the Channel squadron consisted of ten English\r\nmen-of-war and merchantmen and four Dutch ships, a larger force than had\r\nprobably ever been employed before for merely protective duties. The\r\nconditions were as bad or worse, after his death.\r\n\r\n[1074] _State Papers, Dom._, cclxxvii, 43.\r\n\r\n[1075] _Ibid._, xi, 62, 63.

The measurements of the _Nicodemus_,\r\n_Nonsuch_, _Phœnix_, and _Elizabeth_, are from a paper in the _Pepys\r\nMSS._, quoted in Derrick’s _Memoirs of the Royal Navy_. The _Swan_ was\r\nlost off Guernsey in October 1638.\r\n\r\n[1090] Bought in 1642 (_Aud. Off. Dec. Accounts_, 1706, 89).\r\n\r\n[1091] Built in 1646 as a privateer, and employed as such by Warwick\r\n(half share), Pett, Swanley, and others; bought by the Parliament from\r\n20th Jan. 1649, when she was appraised at £2081 (_State Papers, Dom.,\r\nInterreg._, xxiii, 119). The dimensions are from _Harl. MSS._, 4161. She\r\nis popularly said to have been the first frigate built in an English\r\nyard, but it will be seen from the above list that four others, of a\r\nstill more pronounced frigate type, were launched in the same year.\r\n\r\n[1092] The first seven vessels were prizes captured during the civil\r\nwar and taken into the Navy, in which they remained long enough to be\r\nincluded in the Commonwealth lists; the _Globe_, and _Hector_ were\r\nmerchantmen bought into the service. For the names of others see _Aud.\r\nOff. Dec. Accounts_, 1812, 443 A.\r\n\r\n[1093] _State Papers, Dom._, xxi, 72.\r\n\r\n[1094] _Supra_, p. 54. Mr R. C. Leslie (_Old Sea Wings, Ways, and Words_,\r\np. 49 et seq.) believes all the smaller craft of old, and some large\r\nones, to have been clinker-built.\r\n\r\n[1095] _State Papers, Dom._, lviii, 25.\r\n\r\n[1096] _Ibid._, cxxi, 41.\r\n\r\n[1097] _Ibid._, ccclxv, 17; 1637.\r\n\r\n[1098] _State Papers, Dom._, ccclxiii, 29. It is difficult even in these\r\ndays of mechanical appliances to keep the ports completely water-tight\r\nin heavy weather. Ports were fastened by a bar of wood passed through a\r\nring on the inside; but this could not have been very effectual, and it\r\nwas usual to drive oakum into the seams of the ports when bad weather was\r\nexpected (_Nomenclator Navalis_).\r\n\r\n[1099] The Dutchman was probably Cornelius Drebbel, who claimed to have\r\nsolved the secret of perpetual motion, and to have invented a submarine\r\nboat. His name occurs several times in the _State Papers_ as receiving\r\nrewards for various inventions and appliances, and in 1628 he was\r\nemployed in the preparation of some especial fireships and ‘engines for\r\nfireworks.’\r\n\r\n[1100] _Aud. Off. Dec. Accounts_, 1703, 73.\r\n\r\n[1101] The original waistcloths of the _Prince_ were of silk; ordinary\r\nwaistcloths, the precursors of the later boarding nettings, were still of\r\nred kersey listed with canvas.\r\n\r\n[1102] _State Papers, Dom._, ccliv, 25.\r\n\r\n[1103] _Ibid._, ccxliv, 77, 78.\r\n\r\n[1104] _State Papers, Dom._, cclxvii, 55. Pennington said nothing about\r\nthe crew; he was used to such crews. But Sir Hen. Manwayring remarked\r\nthat he had never seen a ship so wretchedly manned; that, except the\r\nofficers, there was scarcely a seaman on board, and that they were\r\n‘men of poor and wretched person, without clothes or ability of body,\r\ntradesmen, some that never were at sea, a fletcher, glover, or the like,’\r\n(_Add.

Stradling to Nicholas.\r\n\r\n[1180] _Autobiography of the Rev. Devereux Spratt._ London, 1886. It need\r\nhardly be said that the jealousies of Christian princes were a large\r\nfactor in causing the immunity in which these barbarian states so long\r\nrejoiced. Spratt was captured while crossing from Cork to Bristol.\r\n\r\n[1181] It does not come within the design of this work to describe the\r\noperations of fleets at sea, but, in this instance, I must venture to\r\nquestion Mr Gardiner’s depreciatory estimate of William Rainsborow as a\r\ncommander. Mr Gardiner considers that such success as was obtained was\r\ndue neither to Rainsborow’s skill nor to the efficiency of his men, but\r\nto the existence of civil strife, disorganising what might have been a\r\nunited opposition, between the old and new towns of Sallee, situated\r\nopposite each other on the right and left banks of the river Regreb\r\n(_Hist. of England_, viii, 270). When Rainsborow arrived off Sallee on\r\n24th March with four ships, he found that they drew too much water to\r\nclose in effectually with the town. Instead of wandering off helplessly\r\nto Cadiz and spending his time in ‘shooting and ostentation,’ as Mansell\r\ndid to Malaga under adverse circumstances, Rainsborow, while he sent\r\nto England for lighter vessels, organised a blockade with the boats of\r\nhis squadron. So far as I know he was the first of our commanders to\r\nrecognise—and almost invent—the possibilities of boat work on a large\r\nscale, in which English seamen afterwards became such adepts, and it\r\nappears rather that his readiness and resource under unexpected and\r\nunfavourable conditions should alone be sufficient to relieve his memory\r\nfrom the charge of want of skill. That this patrol duty was no child’s\r\nplay is shown by the fact that in one night’s work thirty men were killed\r\nand wounded in the boats (John Dunton, _A True Journal of the Sallee\r\nFleet_. London, 1637). In June he was joined by the _Providence_ and\r\n_Expedition_, which made the task easier; but for the previous three\r\nmonths, riding on a dangerous lee shore, in a bad anchorage, and exposed\r\nto the heavy Atlantic swell, using the ships by day and the boats by\r\nnight, he never relaxed his bulldog grip on the place, in itself a proof\r\nof fine seamanship. That the end came more quickly from the existence of\r\ncivil war is very certain, but I think no one who reads Dunton’s account\r\n(he was an officer of the flagship), and Rainsborow’s own modestly\r\nwritten Journal (_State Papers, Dom._, ccclxix, 72), can doubt that the\r\nresult would eventually have been the same, seeing that the blockade grew\r\ncloser day by day until at last every vessel which attempted to pass in\r\nor out was captured or destroyed. In August, when the enemy were already\r\ncrushed, two more ships joined him, and he was then quite strong enough\r\nto have dealt with both the old and new towns, had they been united, or\r\nto have gone on, as he desired to go on, to settle accounts with Algiers.\r\nIt should also be remarked that Rainsborow anticipated Blake in attacking\r\nforts with ships, the _Providence_ being sent in within musket range of\r\nthe castle and coming out unscathed from the contest. Looked at from\r\nanother point of view, and compared with the French attempts against\r\nSallee, Rainsborow’s ability and success stand out just as clearly. In\r\n1624 M. de Razilly was sent down with a squadron, but permitted himself\r\nto be driven off by weather; in 1629 he came again, and, after lying\r\noff the port for three months and negotiating on equal terms with these\r\nsavages, had to depart without having obtained the release of a single\r\nFrench captive. A surely significant contrast!\r\n\r\nThat Charles was satisfied with Rainsborow does not, perhaps, prove\r\nmuch, although he offered him knighthood and did give him a gold medal\r\nand chain and make him captain of the _Sovereign_, a post then of\r\nhigh honour. But Northumberland, a very much better judge was equally\r\nwell pleased, and in 1639, strongly recommended him to the burgesses\r\nof Aldborough as their member. Northumberland, not then Lord Admiral,\r\nbut paramount in naval affairs, is also entitled to a measure of the\r\ncredit of success; for had Rainsborow been dependent on the energy and\r\nintelligence of the Principal Officers of the Navy for the supplies which\r\nenabled him to keep his station he would probably have fared but badly.\r\nAnd doubtless many of the men who under him worked with such courage and\r\ndevotion had formed part of the demoralised and useless crews who were\r\nsuch objects of scorn to Wimbledon and his officers before Cadiz in 1625.\r\nThe only difference was in the commander.\r\n\r\n[1182] _State Papers, Dom._, cccclix, 8, 60.\r\n\r\n[1183] Halliwell’s _Royal Letters_, II, 277.\r\n\r\n[1184] The first Commissioners of the Admiralty acted by Letters Patent\r\nof 20th September 1628.

Powers were granted to them or any\r\nthree of them. Although in modern phrase they are called Lords of the\r\nAdmiralty, they were in reality a committee of the Privy Council,\r\ncarrying out the instructions of the King and Council, who retained\r\nthe power and exercised the control of an eighteenth century Admiralty\r\nBoard. A fresh commission was issued on 20th November 1632, which\r\nomitted Lords Pembroke and Dorchester, and added Lord Cottington, Sir\r\nFrancis Windebank, and Sir Henry Vane (the elder). The third and last\r\ncommission was of 16th March 1636 to William Juxon, Bishop of London,\r\nLord Treasurer, Lords Cottington, Lindsey, and Dorset; and Vane, Coke,\r\nand Windebank.\r\n\r\n[1185] His patent as Lord Admiral was dated 28th Jan. 1619.\r\n\r\n[1186] _State Papers, Dom., Charles I_, ccxli, 85, 86.\r\n\r\n[1187] _Add.

The great difference was that at the later date, whether\r\nfrom higher principle or stricter discipline, the combatant branches of\r\nthe service were honest, the theft and jobbery being confined to the\r\nAdmiralty, Navy and Victualling Boards, and dockyard establishments. Lord\r\nSt Vincent said of the Navy Board that it was ‘the curse of the Navy,’\r\nand the methods of the dockyards may be gauged from the fact that while\r\nthe (present) _Victory_ cost £97,400 to build, £143,600 were in fifteen\r\nyears expended on her repairs. Of the Admiralty there will be much to be\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n[1224] _State Papers, Dom._, ccxxix, 114.\r\n\r\n[1225] _Ibid._, ccxlv, 19.\r\n\r\n[1226] _State Papers, Dom._, cviii, 18.\r\n\r\n[1227] _Ibid._, ccxxvii, 1.\r\n\r\n[1228] _Ibid._, cclxix, 67.\r\n\r\n[1229] _Ibid._, ccclxxvi, 160 and ccccxlii, 12.

Professor Hosmer (_Life of Sir H. Vane the\r\nYounger_, p. 497) says that Vane, ‘had created the fleet out of nothing,\r\nhad given it guns and men.’ He appears to think that a naval force, with\r\nits subsidiary manufactures and establishments, could be created in a\r\nfew years, but, as a matter of fact, Parliament commenced the struggle\r\ninfinitely better equipped at sea than on land, and it was so powerful\r\nafloat that it did not find it necessary to begin building again till\r\n1646, when the result of the struggle was assured. If Mr Hosmer is\r\nreferring to a later period, the statement is still more questionable,\r\nsince the number of men-of-war had been increased and Vane had ceased\r\nto have any special connexion, except in conjunction with others, with\r\nnaval affairs. Allowing for his narrow intelligence and vacillating\r\ntemperament Charles showed more persistence and continuity of design\r\nin the government of the Navy than in any other of his regal duties;\r\nfor, although relatively weaker as regards other powers, England, as\r\nfar as ships and dockyards were concerned, was stronger absolutely in\r\n1642 than in 1625. The use made of the ship-money showed that under no\r\ncircumstances could Charles have been a great naval organiser; but he has\r\nat least a right to have it said that he improved the _matériel_ of the\r\nNavy so far as his limited views and disastrous domestic policy permitted.\r\n\r\nReturning to Vane, Mr Hosmer says in one place (p. 148), that the post\r\nof Treasurer was worth £30,000, and in another (p. 376), £20,000 a\r\nyear. What Mr Hosmer’s authority (G. Sikes, _The Life and Death of Sir\r\nHenry Vane_), really writes is, ‘The bare poundage, which in time of\r\npeace came to about £3000, would have amounted to about £20,000 by the\r\nyear during the war with Holland.’ The poundage in peace years never\r\napproached £3000, and, as Vane ceased to be Treasurer in 1650, and,\r\nfrom the date of his resignation, a lower scale of payment was adopted,\r\nthe second part of the calculation is obviously nothing to the purpose.\r\nWhether the reduction in the Treasurer’s commission was due to Vane, or\r\nwhether he resigned on account of it, we have no evidence to show, nor\r\ndo vague generalities help to clear the doubt. As bearing testimony to\r\nVane’s disinterestedness Mr Hosmer quotes Sikes to the effect that he\r\nreturned half his receipts, from the date of his appointment as sole\r\nTreasurer, at the time of the self-denying ordinance. Unfortunately\r\nthe accounts previous to 1645 are wanting and the question must remain\r\nopen, but if the probability may be judged by general tendency it must\r\nbe said to be extremely unlikely, since he was Treasurer from 8th Aug.\r\n1642 till 31st Dec. 1650, and during that time received in poundage and\r\nsalary for the five-and-a-half years for which the accounts remain the\r\nsum of £19,620, 1s 10d. There is no sign in the audit office papers\r\nthat he returned one penny of his legal dues, and, whoever else had\r\nto wait, he seems to have paid himself liberally and punctually. Mr\r\nHosmer has only indirectly noticed that Parliament, when Vane resigned,\r\nsettled a retiring pension on him. Sikes says, ‘some inconsiderable\r\nmatter without his seeking, was allotted to him by the Parliament in\r\nlieu thereof’ (_i.e._, of his place). The ‘inconsiderable matter,’ was\r\nlanded estate producing £1200 a year. Seeing that he held his post\r\nfor only seven and a half years, that during that time he must have\r\nreceived at least £25,000, and that all previous Treasurers had been,\r\non occasion, dismissed without any suggestion of compensation, his\r\ndisinterestedness may be questioned. When Parliament voted Ireton an\r\nestate of £2000 a year he refused it on account of the poverty of the\r\ncountry. And Sikes’s version that it was ‘without his seeking’ is not\r\nabsolutely beyond doubt. On June 27th, 1650, a petition of Vane’s was\r\nreferred to a committee to discuss how the treasurership was to be\r\nmanaged from Dec. 31st following, and ‘also to consider what compensation\r\nis fit to be given to the petitioner out of that office or otherwise in\r\nconsideration of his right in the said office.’ It is no unjustifiable\r\nassumption to infer from this the possibility that the petition at any\r\nrate included a claim for compensation. Sikes, again, tells us that he\r\ncaused his subordinate Hutchinson to succeed him, but when, on 10th Oct.\r\n1650, the motion was before the House that the ‘question be now put’\r\nwhether Hutchinson’s appointment should be made, Vane was one of the\r\ntellers for the ‘Noes’ and was beaten by 27 to 18. This was immediately\r\nfollowed by Hutchinson’s nomination without a division. The incidents\r\nof Hutchinson’s official career imply a much stronger and more lasting\r\ninfluence than that of Vane, but the only importance of the question is\r\nas affecting the trustworthiness of the latter’s seventeenth century\r\nbiographer. Mr Hosmer, like all other writers on Vane, appears to quote\r\nSikes with implicit faith, but the man evidently wrote only loosely and\r\ngenerally, making up in enthusiasm what he lacked in exactness; _e.g._,\r\n‘In the beginning of that expensive war he resigned the treasurership of\r\nthe Navy.’ Hutchinson succeeded him from 1st Jan. 1650-1, and war with\r\nHolland did not occur till June 1652. There is nothing to show that Vane\r\nwas not an honest administrator, but his party, fortunately, produced\r\nmany others equally trustworthy.\r\n\r\n[1253] _Add.

Warwick’s was one which differs only in the relative proportions\r\nof the details from the button and badge now in use, except that the\r\nanchor is now fouled. If it is only a coincidence it is a curious one.\r\nPopham, Blake, and Deane employed a modification of Warwick’s seal,\r\nomitting the crown; and the Navy Office adopted another, consisting of\r\nthree anchors, a large centre one with a smaller on each side, and ‘The\r\nSeale of the Navye Office’ round the edge, so that the device selected\r\nby Warwick seems, in one form or another, to have been soon widely used\r\nand continued.

MSS._, 11,602, f. 77), but\r\nthat was very different from the game of long bowls Englishmen had learnt\r\nto be the best medicine for Spaniards, and had never till now discarded.\r\nOur fleets went into action _en masse_, the only rule being that each\r\ncaptain should keep as close as possible to the flag of his divisional\r\ncommander. The result at times was that while some ships were being\r\noverwhelmed by superior force others hardly fired a gun, and an officer\r\nwho had closely obeyed the letter of his instructions might afterwards\r\nfind himself charged with cowardice and neglect of duty.\r\n\r\n[1283] _State Papers, Dom._, 19th March 1649.

The ‘medium’ cost of each\r\nman at sea was reckoned at £4 a month, including wages, victuals, wear\r\nand tear of ships, stores, provision for sick and wounded, and other\r\nincidental expenses. _Rawlinson MSS._ (Bodleian Library), A 9, p. 176.\r\n\r\n[1286] _State Papers, Dom._, 12th May 1649, Council to Generals at sea.\r\n\r\n[1287] It is advisable to dwell on this point because the late Mrs\r\nEverett Green (Preface to _Calendar of State Papers_, 1649-50, p. 24),\r\nsaid, speaking of the Commonwealth seamen generally, that ‘disaffection\r\nand mutiny were frequent among them,’ and writers of less weight have\r\nechoed this opinion. The instances of mutiny were in reality very\r\nfew—seven between 1649 and 1660—were not serious, and were, in every\r\ncase but one attributable to drunkenness or to wages and prize money\r\nremaining unpaid, the single exception being due to the refusal of a\r\ncrew to proceed to sea in what they held to be an unseaworthy ship.\r\nThis is a very trifling number compared with the series of such events\r\noccurring during nearly every year of the reign of Charles I. Of\r\ndisaffection in the sense of a leaning towards the Stewarts there is not\r\na trace among the men, and but two or three examples among officers.\r\nThe exiles in France and Holland, with that optimism peculiar to the\r\nunfortunate, were continually anticipating that ships and men were\r\ncoming over to the royal cause, an anticipation never once verified in\r\nthe event. The analogue of the seventeenth century seaman, if he exists\r\nto-day at all, is to be found, not in the man-of-war’s man, who now has\r\nliterary preferences and an account in the ship’s savings bank, but\r\nin the rough _milieu_ of a trader’s forecastle, and among men of this\r\ntype violence, or even an outbreak of savage ruffianism, by no means\r\nnecessarily implies serious ground of discontent, but may be owing to\r\none of many apparently inadequate causes. There were no such outbreaks\r\namong the Commonwealth seamen, and the punishments for drunkenness and\r\ninsubordination were not disproportionate to the number of men employed,\r\nbut if that is made an argument it should also be applied to the army;\r\nnearly every page of Whitelocke furnishes us with instances of officers\r\nand men being broken, sentenced, or dismissed for theft, insubordination,\r\nand sometimes disaffection, but no one has yet suggested that the army\r\nyearned to restore the Stewarts. The two most striking examples of these\r\nmutinies usually quoted are those of the _Hart_ in 1650 and the riotous\r\nassemblies in London in 1653. In the case of the _Hart_ what actually\r\nhappened was that, the captain and officers being on shore, 28 out of\r\nthe 68 men on board seized the ship when the others were below, with the\r\nintention, according to one contemporary writer, of taking her over to\r\nCharles, according to another, of turning pirates, and according to a\r\nthird, because they were drunk. Perhaps all three causes were at work,\r\nseeing that the mutineers soon quarrelled among themselves, and the loyal\r\nmajority of the crew regained possession of the ship and brought her\r\nback to Harwich. Yet I have seen a serious writer quote the _Hart_ as\r\nan example of desertion to the royalists, an error probably due to the\r\nfact that she was afterwards captured by the Dutch, and eventually sailed\r\nunder a Stewart commission until she blew up at the Canaries. In October\r\n1653 there were tumults in London, due entirely to the non-payment of\r\nprize money, and these, it is true, required to be suppressed by military\r\nforce. But this riot, extending over two days, was the only instance in\r\nwhich the government found difficulty in dealing with the men, and does\r\nnot warrant a general charge of disloyalty during eleven years. If a\r\ndetailed examination of the remaining instances were worth the space,\r\nthey could be shown to be equally due to causes remote from politics.\r\nHistorically, a mutiny among English seamen has never necessarily\r\nsignified disloyalty to the _de facto_ sovereign or government; the\r\nmutineers at Spithead and the Nore in 1797 were especially careful to\r\ndeclare their loyalty to the crown, and their failure at the Nore was\r\nprobably due to the extent to which they carried this feeling. If the\r\ncharacter of the service rendered to the republic is compared with that\r\ngiven to Charles I, it is difficult to understand how the charge of\r\ndisaffection can be maintained.\r\n\r\n[1288] _State Papers, Dom._, 24th May 1652, Council to vice-admirals\r\nof counties. The subject of impressment belongs more fitly to the\r\neighteenth century. Here it will be sufficient to remark that while in\r\nmany cases the government officials reported that the men were coming in\r\nwillingly of their own accord, in others the press masters found great\r\ndifficulty in executing their warrants, and writers of newsletters in\r\nLondon describe the seizure of landsmen and forcible entry of houses,\r\nin which seamen were supposed to be hiding, in a fashion which reminds\r\nthe reader of the beginning of the present century. The two versions are\r\nnot irreconcilable; at all times there has been a remainder, after the\r\nbest men had been obtained, difficult to reach and willing to make any\r\nsacrifice to escape a man-of-war.\r\n\r\n[1289] _Add.

Mr Gardiner has suggested to me\r\nthat the formal enactment of the articles at that particular moment was\r\npossibly directly connected with the defeat off Dungeness in November.\r\nThis view is supported by the fact that they were obviously not aimed at\r\nthe men, with whose conduct no fault had been found and whose position\r\nwas, if anything, improved by them, by the definition of crime and\r\npunishment and the institution of a court of eight officers; while, on\r\nthe other hand, the severest clauses are those affecting officers whose\r\nconduct, both in action and when cruising, had in many cases caused great\r\ndissatisfaction.\r\n\r\n[1291] _State Papers, Dom._, 31st Dec. 1653.\r\n\r\n[1292] _State Papers, Dom._, 4th Feb. 1652.\r\n\r\n[1293] _Ibid._, 15th Dec. 1652.\r\n\r\n[1294] _State Papers, Dom._, lx, 135, October 1653; Bourne to Navy\r\nCommissioners.\r\n\r\n[1295] _State Papers, Dom._, xxix, 57; October 1652.\r\n\r\n[1296] _Ibid._, 6th Jan. 1653.\r\n\r\n[1297] _Ibid._, xxx, 84, and xlv, 66.\r\n\r\n[1298] From the Dutch _Grom_, or Low Latin _Gromettus_, one occupied in\r\na servile office.

John Pearse and Lieut.

The widow of a seaman, killed by an accident\r\non the _Fagons_, had petitioned the Commissioners of sick and wounded for\r\nhelp, and had been refused by them. She then appealed to the Protector,\r\nand her memorial bears his holograph direction to the Commissioners to\r\nreconsider their decision, the case being the same ‘in equity’ as though\r\nthe man had lost his life in action (_State Papers_, cxxx, 98; 10th Nov.\r\n1656).

It would not be just to pass from\r\nthe subject of the aid afforded to the men in disease and suffering\r\nwithout some notice of Elizabeth Alkin, otherwise ‘Parliament Joan,’\r\nwho wore out health and life in their service. This woman appears to\r\nhave nursed wounded soldiers during the civil war, for which she was in\r\nreceipt of a pension, and, in February 1653, volunteered similar help\r\nfor the sailors. She was then ordered to Portsmouth, and, in view of the\r\nbefore noticed condition of the town, must have found very real work to\r\nwhich to put her hand. If £325 went in one item to nurses there must have\r\nbeen plenty of a kind to be had; but she gave her heart to her helpless\r\npatients, and in June had spent not only all the government allowance\r\nbut also her own money, as ‘I cannot see them want if I have it.’ She\r\nwas then sent to Harwich, and on 22nd Feb. 1654 returned, weak and ill,\r\nto London, with only 3s remaining. Of the last £10 given to her she had\r\nspent £6 on the Dutch prisoners at Harwich: ‘Seeing their wants and\r\nmiseries so great, I could not but have pity on them though our enemies.’\r\nA week later she again appeals for at least an instalment of her pension,\r\nor to be sent to a hospital in which ‘to end my days less miserably,’\r\nhaving been forced to sell even her bed. In May and September 1654, two\r\nwarrants, each for £10, were made out, and her name does not occur again.\r\nEven these few data are sufficient to suggest the outline of a life of\r\nself-sacrifice, illumined by a native kindliness of heart and unsoured by\r\nreligious fanaticism, of which there is not a trace in her letters.\r\n\r\n[1325] _State Papers, Dom._, c, 139.\r\n\r\n[1326] From seamen’s wages.\r\n\r\n[1327] By estimation.\r\n\r\n[1328] Average for three years, less taxes.\r\n\r\n[1329] By estimation.\r\n\r\n[1330] _Add.

Prizes, originally privateers and taken into the\r\nservice, are indicated by an asterisk. Being the first attempt at a\r\ncomplete Commonwealth Navy list, it must almost necessarily contain some\r\nerrors, but it is certain that every ship here mentioned was carried on\r\nthe Navy list of the state. A few others omitted as doubtful or more than\r\ndoubtful may really be entitled to a place in it; some of the prizes\r\nassigned to 1653 may belong to 1652, and, in some instances, continuity\r\nor similarity of name renders the exact date of purchase or capture a\r\nlittle problematical. It has not been thought necessary to overload this\r\nlist with the innumerable references that could be given, especially\r\nas the details seldom exactly agree in the various papers, but no name\r\nhas been inserted except on what appears to be sufficient authority.\r\nDering’s _Dolphin_, _Minion_ and _Pearl Brigantine_, I have been unable\r\nto place; the _Pearl_ is only once mentioned, in 1658, as being ‘for use\r\nas occasion requires.’ The _Diver_ which is also given by him, was not\r\na man-of-war at all, but a hoy temporarily hired for use in recovering\r\nthe guns of wrecked ships, and the _Princess_, of his list, was not\r\nlaunched till August 1660. Some of the Dutch prizes were converted into\r\nfire ships before being sold. The use of fire ships was not new in\r\neither the English or foreign services, but they now appear to have been\r\nsystematically attached to fleets and, on one or two occasions, to have\r\nbeen used with effect.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to remark that the document of April 1660 (_State Papers_,\r\nccxx, 33), which purports to be a list of ships then existing, is\r\naltogether untrustworthy.\r\n\r\n[1347] The _Guinea_, _Amity_, _Concord_, _Discovery_, _Gilliflower_,\r\n_Mayflower_, _Hopewell_, _Accada_, _Nonsuch Ketch_, and _Marmaduke_, were\r\nbought into the service in the respective years under which they are\r\nplaced, and are marked (B).\r\n\r\n[1348] Or _Great President_.\r\n\r\n[1349] The _Gilliflower_, then called the _Archangel_, and the\r\n_Marmaduke_, were two prizes taken by Rupert, recaptured at sea by their\r\nown crews, brought back to England, and taken into the service.\r\n\r\n[1350] Usually said to have been lost in action of July 1653, but can be\r\ntraced as the _Dunkirk_ after 1660.\r\n\r\n[1351] There is a model of the _Bristol_ in the museum of the Royal Naval\r\nCollege of Greenwich. No confirmatory evidence is added to the bare\r\nstatements of names and dates on the labels attached to these models, and\r\nthe dates assigned to some of them do not inspire a heedless confidence.\r\nHowever, from the character of the decoration, etc., the model ticketed\r\n_Bristol_ is probably, at any rate, of this period.\r\n\r\n[1352] Rebuilt.\r\n\r\n[1353] Rebuilt.\r\n\r\n[1354] Most of the Commonwealth ships were named after some event of the\r\ncivil war.

It is very likely that the message did reach Cromwell.\r\n\r\n[1383] The Parliamentary Navy Committee, which had managed matters\r\nthroughout the civil war, existed for some time contemporaneously with\r\nthe Admiralty Committee. But it soon lost all authority.\r\n\r\n[1384] _State Papers, Dom._, 12th March 1649.\r\n\r\n[1385] The first Commissioners of the Admiralty and Navy were Generals,\r\nRobert Blake, George Monk, John Disborowe, and Wm. Penn; Colonels, Philip\r\nJones, John Clerk, and Thos. Kilsey; Major Wm. Burton, and John Stone,\r\nEdward Horseman and Vincent Gookin, Esquires. They acted from 3rd Dec.\r\n1653.\r\n\r\n[1386] _Commons Journals_, 1st June 1659.\r\n\r\n[1387] Holland, Smith, Pett, and Willoughby, were appointed by order of\r\nthe House on 16th Feb. 1649; Thompson was added later in place of captain\r\nRoger Tweedy, who had been a Commissioner during the civil war, and who\r\nwas again proposed but rejected on 16th February. On 21st of February the\r\nHouse ordered that Holland, like Batten called Surveyor, was to have £300\r\na year; the others £250 a year.\r\n\r\n[1388] _State Papers, Dom._, 9th May 1649. This letter is signed by\r\nHolland, Smith, and Thompson. The tone of Holland’s _Discourse of the\r\nNavy_ (1638), is one of fulsome adulation of the Monarchy and the\r\nprinciples it represented; but the _Discourse_ was not in print and he\r\nhad had time to realise the new tendency. Holland was the least active of\r\nthe Commissioners, but if he helped to carry out some of the reforms he\r\nrecommended in 1638 he did his share of service.\r\n\r\n[1389] _State Papers, Dom._, 20th July 1653, Monk to Admiralty Committee.\r\n\r\n[1390] Substitutes for pursers; see _infra_, p. 356.\r\n\r\n[1391] _State Papers, Dom._, 27th July 1653.\r\n\r\n[1392] _Ibid._, 11th April 1654.\r\n\r\n[1393] _State Papers, Dom._, ciii, 72, 73; 1655.\r\n\r\n[1394] _Naval Speculations and Maritime Politicks_, Lond. 1691.\r\n\r\n[1395] _State Papers, Dom._, cxxxii, 115; 1656.\r\n\r\n[1396] _State Papers, Dom._, cxxi, 16, Navy Commissioners to Admiralty\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n[1397] _State Papers, Dom._, clxxxii, 8, 111.\r\n\r\n[1398] _State Papers, Dom._, 30th June 1653.\r\n\r\n[1399] _Ibid._, 31st Dec. 1653.\r\n\r\n[1400] _State Papers, Dom._, cxxvi, 99.\r\n\r\n[1401] _Ibid._, 2nd Sept. 1653.\r\n\r\n[1402] _Add.

John Saltonstall and\r\nJohn Wadsworth were involved with the four others. Wadsworth certainly\r\ncommanded a hired merchantman; Saltonstall’s ship is doubtful.\r\n\r\n[1405] Accused by his crew (_Adventure_), who were prepared ‘to spend our\r\nlives and limbs in this service for the good of our native country of\r\nEngland and this government.’ He was in trouble again in 1656.\r\n\r\n[1406] Allowed two colliers to be captured, and would not chase because\r\nthey were ‘only colliers.’\r\n\r\n[1407] ‘The prize office commissioners said they thought the devil must\r\nbe in that captain to sell all and bring nothing but bare hulls of ships.’\r\n\r\n[1408] ‘The court did not think it meet to expel him, being an active and\r\nstout-fighting man.’\r\n\r\n[1409] No result appears to have been arrived at about the captain, but\r\nthe court-martial found that the boatswain, he was charged with maiming\r\nhad struck him, but they ‘possessed no power to sentence him’—a very\r\nstrange conclusion to come to.\r\n\r\n[1410] Second offence.
