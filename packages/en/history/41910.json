LEA\r\n\r\n  Who through his numerous scholarly monographs has earned the foremost\r\n  place among American Church historians, both at home and abroad,\r\n\r\n  AND TO\r\n\r\n  PROFESSOR DOCTOR ADOLPH HARNACK\r\n\r\n  To whom both the Old and the New World are profoundly indebted for his\r\n  scholarly labours, and from whose inspiration in public lectures and\r\n  private conferences this work derived much that is best in it,\r\n\r\n  THIS BOOK IS GRATEFULLY DEDICATED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe educational value of any subject depends primarily upon its own\r\nintrinsic value. The teaching of Church history for ten years as a\r\nregular course in liberal arts, side by side with the \"orthodox\" courses\r\nin history, has demonstrated beyond question that this subject can be\r\nmade at once very popular and very valuable. It has proved its right to\r\nexist as a cultural subject. Yet the lack of intelligent information,\r\neven among educated people, concerning the history of the Christian\r\nChurch, both in early and modern days, is simply appalling.\r\n\r\nThe comparatively recent revival of interest in Church history has given\r\nbirth to many general Church histories from English and American\r\nscholars. Numerous translations of discriminating and painstaking German\r\nauthors are also available. A large number of intensive monographs has\r\nlikewise appeared. But all these texts are written for classes in\r\ntheological schools. Not a single Church history suitable either for\r\nregular college work, or for popular reading, is available; and yet all\r\nthe standard courses in history are provided with up-to-date texts and\r\nillustrative material.\r\n\r\nThis work is intended to meet the need I have felt in my own classes,\r\nand have heard expressed from fellow teachers and laymen, for a simple\r\naccount of the evolution of the old Church minus all theological and\r\ndogmatic discussions. The purpose has been to show the origin of the\r\nChristian Church, its development in organisation, the forces which\r\nproduced the Papacy, and the marvellous, formative influence of the\r\nRoman Church upon the civilisation of Western Europe. To that end the\r\nprincipal lines of development are emphasised at every point, while the\r\nsubordinate influences have been minimised. Causes and results,\r\ncontinuity and differentiation, and unity have been constantly kept in\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nThe subject-matter of this volume was worked out during a prolonged\r\nresidence in Europe. Most of that time was spent in Germany under the\r\ninspiration of the foremost authorities in Church history, among whom\r\nmay be mentioned Professor Nippold of Jena, Professor Loofs of Halle,\r\nProfessor Hauck of Leipzig, and particularly Professor Harnack of\r\nBerlin. The work of the lecture-room and seminar was supplemented by\r\ninvestigation in the Royal Library of Berlin, the Vatican Library at\r\nRome, the National Library at Paris, and the Library of the British\r\nMuseum. The materials thus gathered were further organised and\r\nelaborated in a course of lectures on Church history given in Syracuse\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\nThe references in the text and the bibliographies at the end of chapters\r\nare given, so far as possible, to English sources. It is believed that\r\nthe exclusion of a pedantic list of foreign works will make the work\r\nmore useful. It is hoped that the student will be induced to go to the\r\nlibrary, the laboratory of the historian, and there by extensive and\r\nintensive reading supplement the text.\r\n\r\nShould this volume prove to be of service, it will be followed by two\r\ncompanion volumes--one on the Reformation and another on the modern\r\nChurch. It is further planned to publish a source-book on Church history\r\nto supplement the texts.\r\n\r\nMy indebtedness to books and men is so great that it would be impossible\r\nto enumerate them here. While all sources have been laid under tribute,\r\nspecial obligation is felt to many monographs and intensive studies.\r\n\r\n                                              ALEXANDER C.

While\r\nit seems to be receiving more and more cultivation from a few of us, it\r\nfails to command the attention of the educated public in the same\r\nproportion. We are strongly of the opinion that beyond the requisitions\r\nof academical and professional examination there is very little reading\r\nof Church history in any way.\"[1:2] Only twenty-five years ago Professor\r\nEmerton, upon taking the chair of ecclesiastical history in Harvard\r\nUniversity, could say with truth: \"There are to-day not more than half\r\na dozen colleges in the country where any adequate provision for an\r\nindependent department of history has been made.\"[2:1] At the present\r\ntime, happily, the condition so much deplored in the last quotation has\r\nbeen remedied to a very large degree. Every great university in America\r\nhas a well-organised faculty of history and allied subjects, while a\r\nlarge majority of the smaller institutions of higher education have\r\nregularly organised departments of history with instructors,\r\nwell-trained at home or abroad, who devote all their time to the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding these facts, the statement made about Church\r\nhistory still remains essentially true. The political, industrial,\r\neducational, and social sides of history have been emphasised by the\r\ncreation of new departments with new courses of study, and by the\r\nwriting of many text-books, monographs, and general treatises.\r\nProfessorships of sociology, political economy, political science,\r\nconstitutional law, education, and literature have been created in\r\nunprecedented numbers. Ecclesiastical history, on the contrary, has been\r\nall but ignored. Even in Germany, where the greatest strides have been\r\nmade in the subject, it is still relegated to the theological faculty,\r\nthough the number of philosophical students selecting it often exceeds\r\nthat of the theological--a very significant fact. In America it would be\r\ndifficult to point out more than a very few universities or colleges\r\nwhere a chair in Church history is put on an equality with chairs of\r\nother branches of history or of correlated subjects. Its proper place,\r\nin both scholastic and popular estimation, is in the theological\r\nseminary, and there it has always remained as a \"professional\" study.\r\nEven in this restricted sense, however, its intrinsic worth has placed\r\nit among the most important courses in the curriculum, and has given it\r\na standing beyond \"professional\" circles. Some of America's greatest\r\nscholars have contributed powerfully, through the class-room, lectures,\r\nand books, to give Church history its rightful place both as a\r\n\"professional\" and as a \"liberal\" branch of learning.\r\n\r\nUntil Luther led the great reformatory schism in the sixteenth century,\r\nall historians, crude and unscientific though much of their work was,\r\nrecognised the necessary union of political and ecclesiastical history.\r\nThe Venerable Bede began his celebrated history not with the coming of\r\nAbbot Augustine and his monks, but with the landing of Cæsar and his\r\nRoman cohorts. As modern civilisation crept over western Europe and\r\ncrossed the mighty deep to Columbia's shores, carrying with it the\r\nrevolutionising Teutonic conception of the national state with its new\r\nduties and relationships, the tendency was to magnify the political and\r\nsocial sides of history at the expense of the religious. The hatreds and\r\nmisunderstandings of the Reformation, though doing something to rectify\r\nthe \"orthodox\" history of the old Church, really put members of the old\r\norganisation wholly on the defensive, and checked for centuries anything\r\nlike a genuinely sympathetic and scientific study of the old Church by\r\nProtestant historians. With Neander, that sympathetic Christian of\r\nJewish descent, and the scholarly Gieseler, a new era opened. The\r\ngrowing doctrine of the separation of Church and state accentuated the\r\nbreach between political and religious history. The early crude\r\nconception of specialisation also separated sacred from profane\r\nhistory, and turned the former over wholly to the theologian. Secular\r\nhistorians took the position of Napoleon when invited to enter the Holy\r\nCity: \"Jerusalem does not enter into the line of my operations.\"\r\n\r\nAt last the Church historian and the civic historian have joined hands,\r\nand look each other in the face. They see that their aim is essentially\r\ncommon: to know the truth about the past. This search for truth for its\r\nown sake is purely modern--almost contemporaneous. Formerly, history was\r\nwritten to justify or disprove some theory of political or\r\necclesiastical polity, or to glorify some dynasty, sect, party, or hero,\r\nor to vindicate some hypothesis or set of ideas. The historian was not a\r\nsearcher for truth, but a lawyer with a cause to plead. It is generally\r\nrealised now that the historian, whether he deals with the state, the\r\nChurch, society, education, or industry, is working an important part of\r\nthe field of general history. A knowledge of each one of these\r\ninstitutions is necessary to supplement and explain any or all of the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThis institutional interdependence seems to be generally recognised now.\r\n\"The web of history,\" said Professor Hatch in beginning his great work\r\nat Oxford, \"is woven of one piece; it reflects the unity of human life,\r\nof which it is the record. We cannot isolate any group of facts and\r\nconsider that no links of causation connect them with their predecessors\r\nor their contemporaries. Just as Professor Freeman insists on the\r\ncontinuity of history, so I wish to insist on its solidarity.\"[4:1] The\r\nmutual labours of scholars in correlating fields have revolutionised\r\nour historical knowledge of the early and later Middle Ages. A multitude\r\nof controverted points have vanished like ghosts. We see the old Church\r\nnow as we never saw it before. The Catholic Church and the mediæval\r\npapacy were the greatest of the creations of the first fifteen centuries\r\nof the Christian era. The mediæval Church was not exclusively a\r\nreligious organisation. It was more of an ecclesiastical state. It had\r\nlaws, lawyers, courts, and prisons. If not born into it, all the people\r\nof western Europe were at least baptised into it. It levied taxes on its\r\nsubjects. Standards of patriotism and treason were more sharply defined\r\nthan in the modern state.[5:1] The evolution of this great organisation\r\nis the central fact of the first thirteen centuries after Christ. It\r\naimed to control the whole life of its subjects here and to determine\r\ntheir destiny hereafter. Well may our greatest American Church\r\nhistorian, Henry C. Lea, ask: \"What would have been the condition of the\r\nworld if that organisation had not succeeded in bearing the ark of\r\nChristianity through the wilderness of the first fifteen\r\ncenturies?\"[5:2]\r\n\r\nThe history of Europe, then, after the Roman period must be looked at\r\nthrough the eyes of the Church. The character and works of that great\r\ninstitution must first be studied, not pathologically but\r\nsympathetically. The historian, if honest, dare not show a \"lack of\r\nappreciation of the service rendered to humanity by the organisation\r\nwhich in all ages has assumed for itself the monopoly of the heritage of\r\nChrist.\"[5:3] He must recognise the fact that \"ecclesiastical history is\r\nsimply the spiritual side of universal history.\"[6:1] \"The value of a\r\nscience depends on its own intrinsic merits,\" says Alzog.[6:2] When the\r\ngreat Teacher commanded from the Mount of Olives, \"Go ye into all the\r\nworld and preach the gospel,\" that mount became the pivot on which the\r\nwhole world's history has turned.\r\n\r\n     If the Christian religion be a matter, not of mint, anise, and\r\n     cummin, but of justice, mercy, and truth; if the Christian\r\n     religion be not a priestly caste, or a monastic order, or a\r\n     little sect, or a handful of opinions, but the whole\r\n     congregation of faithful men dispersed throughout the world;\r\n     if the very word which of old represented the chosen \"people\"\r\n     is now to be found in the \"laity\"; if the biblical usage of\r\n     the phrase \"ecclesia\" literally justifies Tertullian's\r\n     definition: _Ubi tres sunt laici, ibi est ecclesia_; then the\r\n     range of the history of the Church is as wide as the range of\r\n     the world which it was designed to penetrate.[6:3]\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty with the study of Church history in the past has\r\nbeen that teachers treated it wholly from a theological standpoint. That\r\nmay have been proper when the subject was viewed as a narrow\r\n\"professional\" study only. A new and better conception of the subject,\r\nhowever, as a part of the pregnant history of humanity, has brought with\r\nit a higher estimation of its value as a cultural study. All that can be\r\nclaimed for historical studies in general can be claimed for it: mental\r\ndiscipline, broad culture, a view of practical life, enlarged sympathies\r\nand lessened prejudices, a truer conception of duty, and a saner\r\nestimate of the significance of current events. In addition it may be\r\nventured that no subject can be of greater vital importance to the\r\nstudent for the very reason that it deals with the most important of all\r\nsubjects. In order to do the most good as a liberal branch of learning,\r\nChurch history must be taught not as theology or dogma, but as a\r\npowerful civilising institution like the state or the school. Then it\r\nwill be true that \"neither can the profane historian, the jurist, the\r\nstatesman, the man of letters, the artist, nor the philosopher safely\r\nneglect the study of Church history.\"[7:1] For each one of these\r\npersons, as well as the minister, needs that \"pragmatic view\" of all the\r\nchanges and developments of the Christian Church and the influence it\r\nhas exerted on all other human relations.[7:2]\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years, however, there has been a noticeable\r\nawakening of interest in Church history both within and without college\r\nwalls. The indefatigable labours of a few men like Henry C. Lea, who has\r\ngiven us a series of invaluable monographs on the history of the old\r\nChurch, have had much to do with the new status of Church history.\r\nUniversities are already recognising courses in Church history offered\r\nby divinity schools as \"liberal arts\" electives for undergraduate and\r\npostgraduate study. The writers of recent text-books on general history,\r\nas well as in particular fields, recognise the revolution and try to\r\nmake amends for the sin of omission by giving the Church a prominence\r\nnever recognised before by secular historians.[7:3] Publishers have felt\r\nthe popular pulse and, consequently, \"Studies\" and \"Epochs\" covering\r\nthe whole range of Church history have appeared in cheap and popular\r\nform from the pen of scholar and compiler. Foreign works have been\r\ntranslated. Journals devoted to the study of Church history have been\r\nestablished. Lectureships have been created and endowed. Societies have\r\nbeen organised to further the work. Convenient editions of the \"sources\"\r\nare appearing. Everywhere there seems to be a reaction in favour of this\r\nmisunderstood and neglected subject. An army of scholars is at work\r\ndigging valuable material out of old monasteries, royal archives,\r\nprivate libraries, cemeteries and churches, catacombs, and every\r\nconceivable place of concealment. These labours are being rewarded by\r\nrich discoveries of valuable materials, which are immediately critically\r\nedited by competent hands and printed in translations suitable for all\r\nstudents. Huge collections of these sources are appearing in most of the\r\nEuropean countries.[8:1]\r\n\r\nThe most significant evidence of reaction, however, lies in the fact\r\nthat the most recent courses offered on the Middle Ages in our leading\r\nuniversities are essentially courses in Church history. The name matters\r\nlittle so long as students approach the instructive history of western\r\nEurope from the right standpoint. Thus, at length, has come the\r\nfulfilment of the prophecy of Professor Koethe (d. 1850), made many\r\nyears ago: \"It is reserved to future ages, and in a special sense to the\r\ninstitutions of learning, to give to Church history its proper place in\r\nthe curriculum of studies. When its nature and importance come to be\r\nfully known and appreciated it will be no longer limited to one\r\nfaculty.\"\r\n\r\nThe best pedagogical methods must be applied to Church history in order\r\nto obtain the best results. To that end these practical suggestions are\r\noffered:\r\n\r\n1. Emphasis ought to be laid on ideas back of events rather than on the\r\nevents themselves.\r\n\r\n2. The important ought to be distinguished from the unimportant at every\r\nstep. Athanasius and Augustine are worthier subjects of study than\r\nFlavian and Optatus. The invasion and conversion of the Teutons are more\r\nimportant than disputes over Easter or the shape of the tonsure.\r\n\r\n3. Original sources ought to be used so far as possible. History should\r\nbe studied \"from the sources of friend and foe, in the spirit of truth\r\nand love, _sine ira et studio_.\"[9:1]\r\n\r\n4. Both Protestant and Catholic secondary authorities ought to be read\r\non every important controverted point.\r\n\r\n5. Origins ought to be studied with special care.\r\n\r\n6. Transition periods rather than crises ought to be given the most\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n7. Biographies of epoch-making men like Constantine, Gregory the Great,\r\nCharlemagne, Hildebrand, St. Francis, Innocent III., etc., ought to be\r\ncarefully considered.\r\n\r\n8. Causes and results ought to be closely worked out and\r\nclassified.[9:2]\r\n\r\n9. The continuity of the Church as a great force in the world ought to\r\nbe ever kept in mind.[9:3]\r\n\r\n10. Differentiation ought to be thoughtfully noted through the ages.\r\n\r\n11. The unity of history--the influence of the Church upon every other\r\ninstitution--ought to be followed from one transitional period to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n12. The sympathetic attitude ought to be taken at all times in judging\r\nmen and movements. The student ought to stand in the centre of the\r\ncircle so that he may see all points of the circumference--all persons,\r\nall events, all parties, all creeds, all sects, all shades of\r\nopinion--and see their true historical relations.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\n   1.--Bright, W., _The Study of Church History_.

II.--Secondary materials.\r\n     III.--Sketch of the writing of Church history. IV.--Most\r\n     important collections of primary sources. V.--Most important\r\n     general Church histories. VI.--Dictionaries and encyclopedias.\r\n     VII.--Atlases and chronologies. VIII.--Text-books.\r\n     IX.--Sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll our information about the origin, life, and growth of the Christian\r\nChurch comes from the revelation of evidence which is termed sources.\r\nThese sources are partly original, or primary, and partly secondary. For\r\nthe student of history both kinds of sources have a definite character\r\nand value, and are, therefore, of peculiar interest. Some knowledge\r\nabout the scope and nature of the sources is necessary for an intelligent\r\nview of any field of history. At the same time it is clear that any\r\nperson presuming to pose as an authority on a given phase of history\r\nmust not only be thoroughly acquainted with the varied contributions of\r\nall secondary works, but must also be a master of the character and\r\nworth of all first-hand materials.\r\n\r\nThe primary sources are simply the records and remains left by the\r\npeople who lived at any given time. Such materials, it will be readily\r\nseen, give the nearest and truest account of the ideas, feelings,\r\nmotives, and beliefs, as well as of the deeds and actions, of man. An\r\noriginal source is, therefore, merely a source back of which one cannot\r\ngo for historical information. It is apparent, consequently, that the\r\nprimary sources are the more important because they are the very\r\nfoundations of history. \"No documents, no history,\" tersely declared\r\nLanglois. The primary sources put us in vital connection with the\r\nthoughts, doings, and institutions of past times. In them one sees\r\nreflected the spirit of the age. Every line, every word, is a\r\nrevelation. The student is led to feel history, to actually know men and\r\nwomen of the past, and thus to comprehend our own civilisation in the\r\nearlier periods of its evolution. The primary sources cannot be accepted\r\nand assigned their true value, however, until their authenticity and\r\ngenuineness are determined, and the element of personal equation is\r\ntaken into account. Even then final judgment can never be absolute.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of giving a clear conception of the range of the primary\r\nsources the following classification may be of assistance:\r\n\r\nA.--Written sources of the subjoined kind:\r\n\r\n    I.--Public official documents:\r\n\r\n     1. Acts of councils and synods.\r\n\r\n     2. Letters, bulls, briefs, rescripts, and regests of popes,\r\n          patriarchs, and bishops.\r\n\r\n     3. Confessions of faith.\r\n\r\n     4. Liturgies, hymns, etc.\r\n\r\n     5. Church canons and laws, and monastic rules.\r\n\r\n     6. Decrees and letters of kings, nobles, and civic assemblies.\r\n\r\n     7. Laws of states.\r\n\r\n   II.--Private writings of personal actors and observers:\r\n\r\n     1. The Apostles.\r\n\r\n     2. Church fathers.\r\n\r\n     3. Heretics and reformers.\r\n\r\n     4. Heathen.\r\n\r\n     5. Chroniclers and historians.\r\n\r\n     6. Missionaries.\r\n\r\n     7. Clergy and laity.\r\n\r\n  III.--Inscriptions on churches, public buildings, tombs,\r\n          monuments, coins, seals, etc.\r\n\r\nB.--Unwritten sources of the following character:\r\n\r\n    I.--Buildings:\r\n\r\n     1. Churches and baptisteries.\r\n\r\n     2. Tombs and monuments.\r\n\r\n     3. Civic edifices.\r\n\r\n     4. Private dwellings.\r\n\r\n   II.--Art:\r\n\r\n     1. Sculpture--images and emblems.\r\n\r\n     2. Painting and fresco.\r\n\r\n     3. Mosaics.\r\n\r\n     4. Ecclesiastical vestments and ornaments.\r\n\r\n     5. Church furniture and vessels.\r\n\r\n  III.--Rites and ceremonies.\r\n\r\n   IV.--Oral traditions.\r\n\r\nThe secondary sources are those that are compiled from a study of the\r\noriginal sources, or from other secondary works, or from both, as is\r\nmore likely to be the case. This class of material is very abundant, and\r\nvaries greatly in character and value because of the striking difference\r\nin authorship, style, and purpose. It is always necessary, therefore,\r\ncarefully to discriminate the wheat from the chaff and to be able easily\r\nto recognise the \"earmarks\" of a reliable authority. Many of the works\r\nproduced by modern scientific scholarship are excellent in every\r\nrespect, and, in many fields of historical study, absolutely\r\nindispensable. Secondary sources may be divided as follows:\r\n\r\nA.--Written works:\r\n\r\n    I.--History:\r\n\r\n     1. General treatises based upon either primary sources, or\r\n          secondary materials, or both.\r\n\r\n     2. Encyclopedias and dictionaries.\r\n\r\n     3. Monographs, essays, and articles.\r\n\r\n   II.--Fiction:\r\n\r\n     1. Novels.\r\n\r\n     2. Poetry.\r\n\r\n     3. Drama.\r\n\r\nB.--Unwritten:\r\n\r\n    I.--Oral traditions and reports.\r\n\r\n   II.--Transmitted rites and ceremonies.\r\n\r\n  III.--Works of art copied from originals.\r\n\r\nThe earliest account of the history of the Christian Church extant is\r\nthe New Testament. The \"Memoirs\" of Hegesippus, a converted Jew of the\r\nsecond century, is the first known effort to record the growth of the\r\nChurch, but all his books are lost.[15:1] Eusebius, the Greek bishop,\r\ncalled the \"Father of Church history,\" wrote a comprehensive\r\n_Ecclesiastical History_ to 324. Socrates, Sozomen, and Theodoret, each\r\nafter his own ideal, continued the narrative of Eusebius. Rufinus\r\ntranslated the work of Eusebius into Latin and continued it to 395,\r\nwhile Epiphanius translated Socrates, Sozomen, and Theodoret into Latin\r\nand brought the record to 518. Theodorus and Evagrius were also\r\ncontinuators of these early works. Sulpicius Severus, a Gallic monk of\r\nnoble birth, penned a fabulous chronicle of little worth.\r\n\r\nThe Middle Ages produced little of real value in the field of Church\r\nhistory. The chronicles represent the best output. A few scholars of the\r\nEastern Church, the Byzantine historians, the annalists of the Latin\r\nChurch, and several specialists like Gregory of Tours and the Venerable\r\nBede, complete the list. The lives of saints, however, abound.\r\n\r\nThe fierce controversial spirit of the Reformation produced two\r\nmonumental works. Matthias Flacius, aided by other Protestant scholars,\r\nin the _Magdeburg Centuries_, sought to reveal the whole disreputable\r\ncareer of the old Church. This keen voluminous work of the Reformers\r\ncalled forth from the learned Italian, Baronius, a powerful defence of\r\nthe Roman Church in his _Ecclesiastical Annals_. Bossuet, a Frenchman,\r\nin his _Discourse on Universal History_, made a severe attack on\r\nProtestantism, while Tillemont, a Gallic nobleman of Jansenist faith,\r\nwrote critically and with more moderation. In Germany, Hottinger,\r\nSpanheim, and Arnold vindicated the Reformation. Following the earlier\r\nage of fierce theological controversy, Semler, Henke, Schmidt, Hume, and\r\nGibbon wrote in a very rationalistic style and spirit.\r\n\r\nDuring the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, German scholars have led\r\nthe world in their contributions to Church history. The great Mosheim\r\nmade a pronounced improvement in the writing of Church history and\r\nintroduced the modern scientific method. He was not alone the most\r\nlearned theologian of his age in Germany, but was critical in the best\r\nsense, honest and impartial. His disciple, Schroeckh, wrote a work of\r\nforty-five volumes of considerable value. Gieseler improved on\r\nMosheim's method and wrote an ideal outline of Church history with full\r\ncitations to all the known sources. Neander, \"a giant in learning, and a\r\nsaint in piety,\" gave the world an epoch-making _General History of the\r\nChristian Religion and Church_ (1825-52). His writings and his ideals\r\nhave influenced nearly every Church historian since his death, when it\r\nwas said, \"The last of the Church Fathers has gone.\" Among his immediate\r\npupils are Hagenbach, Kurtz, Guericke, Niedner, and Semisch.\r\n\r\nBaur founded the celebrated \"Tübingen School\" and did some excellent\r\nwork in the Ante-Nicene period. Strauss, Zeller, Schenkel, Rothe, and\r\nNippold are the most prominent among his followers.\r\n\r\nThe names of other German historians who have laboured in this domain of\r\nknowledge are so numerous that only a few of the most prominent will be\r\nmentioned. Chief among the Protestants are Hase, Gfroerer, Ebrard,\r\nHerzog, Moeller, Müller, Loofs, Hauck, and Harnack; among the Roman\r\nCatholic writers are Stolberg, Katerkamp, Döllinger, Alzog, Pastor,\r\nHefele, Hergenröther and Janssen.\r\n\r\nAlthough British scholarship has not devoted itself so zealously to the\r\nwriting of Church history, yet some excellent contributions have been\r\nmade by such men as Pusey, Keble, Newman, Waddington, Milman, Stanley,\r\nStubbs, Robertson, Greenwood, Vaughan, Perry, Lingard, Creighton,\r\nGwatkin, Tozer, Hatch, and Orr.\r\n\r\nAmerican interest in the field of Church history is largely the product\r\nof the last thirty years. Most conspicuous among the contributors are\r\nSmith, Lanson, Shedd, Schaff, Fisher, Sheldon, Dryer, Hurst, Newman,\r\nMcGiffert, and Henry C. Lea.\r\n\r\nAt the present time in every Christian country a corps of well-trained\r\nscholars are devoting their lives to nearly every phase of Church\r\nhistory, and the outlook is most gratifying.\r\n\r\nThe literature on Church history, taken as a whole, is perhaps more\r\nvoluminous than that on any other phase of history. The use of the\r\nsources is, in consequence, at the very outset a problem of selection.\r\nIt is apparent, therefore, that the following brief lists are not meant\r\nto be exhaustive. Only the most valuable collections of original\r\ndocuments, and also the most reliable books of a secondary character are\r\nincluded. Special care has been taken to mention all useful collections\r\nof sources in the English language. At the conclusion of each chapter\r\nwill be found references to the sources on special topics.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOST IMPORTANT COLLECTIONS OF PRIMARY SOURCES ARE:\r\n\r\nA.--Official Documents:\r\n\r\n  I.--In English:\r\n\r\n     1.--Brett, T., _Collection of the Principal Liturgies_.\r\n          Lond., 1838.\r\n\r\n     2.--Fulton, J., _Index Canonum_.

II.--Condition of the\r\n     civilised world at the time Jesus came. III.--How the\r\n     condition of the world prepared the way for Christianity.\r\n     IV.--Sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ancient world included the many independent tribes surrounding the\r\nMediterranean Sea and spreading into the interior. This independence was\r\ninstitutional. Each tribe had its own government, laws, and customs; its\r\nown religion and gods; its own ideals of education; its own commercial\r\nand industrial methods. But all these diversities of life and thought\r\nwere broken down by the ascendancy of Rome. The independent laws, gods,\r\nand institutions fell before the onward march of those of the Mistress\r\nof the World.\r\n\r\nWhen Jesus was born, the Roman Empire extended from the Euphrates to the\r\nAtlantic, and from the African desert to the Danube, Rhine, and Weser.\r\nIt formed a wide fringe around the Mediterranean Sea, included the best\r\nparts of three continents, and had a population of 100,000,000.[40:1]\r\nThe Empire was called \"the world.\" Roman law was predominant throughout\r\nthe provinces as well as at Rome, but local usages were tolerated.\r\nCitizenship had become so widely extended that the different peoples\r\nbegan to feel themselves a single race, bound together by one Emperor,\r\none government, and one code of laws.\r\n\r\nThe era of the boyhood of Jesus was one of comparative peace, since\r\nthere was no important war after the naval battle of Actium (31\r\nB.C.).[41:1] Hence the industries of the Empire prospered greatly.\r\nAcross the Mediterranean as the great highway, up and down the rivers,\r\nand along the incomparable Roman roads, an enormous trade was carried on\r\nbetween the colonies and the capital, Rome.[41:2] Factories thrived in\r\nevery direction and commerce flourished. Showers of wealth fairly fell\r\nupon the Eternal City.\r\n\r\nThe trade of the Empire was carried on in Latin, the official language\r\nof the Empire for law and war. Greek was also a universal tongue, but\r\nused more especially for art, science, philosophy, education, and\r\nreligion.[41:3] Cicero complained: \"Greek is read in almost all nations.\r\nLatin is confined by its own natural boundaries.\" Hebrew and other\r\ntongues were sectional. The literature of the opening century of the\r\nChristian era, however, was largely in Latin,[41:4] which had been\r\nfertilised by Greek culture.\r\n\r\nEducation had made far greater progress in this old world than is\r\ngenerally thought. Judea,[41:5] Greece,[41:6] and Rome[42:1] had\r\nexcellent systems of education, though differing much in purpose and in\r\nsubjects studied. Pronounced schools of philosophy grew up. Art,\r\ncomparatively little developed among the Jews, culminated with the\r\nGreeks, and from them was transplanted to Rome. Travel, always\r\nliberalising and educational, was widespread among scholars, tradesmen,\r\nsoldiers, and public officials. All these factors had produced a\r\nsuperior intelligence and general culture throughout the Empire.\r\n\r\nThe religious condition of the Empire was very significant. The Roman\r\nreligion, a mixture of Grecian and Etrurian religions[42:2]--of\r\nlicentiousness and puritanism--was alone legal over the whole\r\nEmpire.[42:3] The Emperor, as Pontifex Maximus, was head of the\r\nreligion. Worship, however, had become mere form--even priests ridiculed\r\nthe gods. Cicero declared: \"One soothsayer could not look another in the\r\nface without laughing,\" and \"even old women would no longer believe\r\neither in the fables of Tartarus or the joys of Elysium.\" This loss of\r\nfaith engendered skepticism and superstition, and gave magicians and\r\nnecromancers a wide patronage. The best men in Rome were demanding\r\nreformation, and were longing for and predicting a new era. Cicero\r\nprophesied: \"There shall no longer be one law at Rome, and another at\r\nAthens; nor shall it decree one thing to-day, and another to-morrow;\r\nbut one and the same law, eternal and immutable, shall be prescribed for\r\nall nations and all times, and the God who shall prescribe, introduce,\r\nand promulgate this law shall be the one common Lord and Supreme Ruler\r\nof all.\"[43:1]\r\n\r\nThe Grecian religion,[43:2] so closely resembling the Roman, was of\r\ncourse tolerated in the Empire. The gods were ideal Greeks with virtues\r\nand vices magnified. They were born, had passions, senses, and bodies\r\nlike men, but never died. They committed crimes, had troubles, and were\r\ngiven to wrath, hatred, lust, cruelty, perjury, deception, and adultery,\r\nyet were omnipotent and omniscient.[43:3] While the conception of Zeus,\r\nas the father of the gods, ruled by fate, had a vague idea of monotheism\r\nin it, still the Greek religion lacked the Christian conception of sin\r\nand righteousness, for with the Greeks sin was only a folly of the\r\nunderstanding--even the gods sinned. Small wonder then that Plato\r\nbanished the gods from his ideal republic.[43:4] Pindar, Eschylus, and\r\nSophocles also urged loftier views of the gods, and preached a higher\r\nmorality.[43:5] With the Roman conquest national honour and patriotism\r\ndied out, and superstition, infidelity, refined materialism, and\r\noutright atheism came in. The best hearts were longing for a new and\r\npurer religion, and were ready to accept it when it came.\r\n\r\nThe Jews,[44:1] intensely religious, with several thousand years of\r\nspiritual history back of them, divided the known world into the\r\nfollowers of the true God and the heathen idolaters. Even they were\r\nseparated into factions:\r\n\r\n(1) The Pharisees,[44:2] numbering 6000, stoical casuists, rigidly\r\northodox, prone to analyse the Mosaic law to death, intensely patriotic,\r\nand bitter against all non-Jewish tendencies, were very popular, guided\r\npublic worship, and controlled the Jews in politics.\r\n\r\n(2) The Sadducees,[44:3] rationalistic and skeptical, were aristocratic\r\nEpicureans who rejected oral traditions, and denied resurrection,[44:4]\r\nangels,[44:5] and an all-ruling, foreknowing Providence. They formed a\r\nsmaller political party in opposition to the Pharisees, held many\r\npriestly offices, were in league with the Romans, and therefore had less\r\ninfluence with the people.[44:6]\r\n\r\n(3) The Essenes,[44:7] a mystic brotherhood of 4000 whose purpose was to\r\nattain holiness, received their ideas from eastern Theosophists; lived\r\ncommunal lives on the shores of the Dead Sea; took the Old Testament\r\nallegorically; wore a white dress; were over-scrupulously clean for the\r\npurpose of purification; and rejected animal food, bloody sacrifices,\r\noaths, slavery, and marriage. They had little to do with politics; were\r\nforerunners of Christian monasticism; and may have influenced the ideas\r\nof Jesus.[45:1]\r\n\r\n(4) The Samaritans,[45:2] in origin half Jewish and half heathen\r\nBabylonian, practised their reformed Judaism about Gerizim under an\r\nestablished Levitical priesthood. They rejected all Scriptures but the\r\nPentateuch, held pure Messianic expectations, looked with favour upon\r\nChristianity, and were bitterly hated by the orthodox Jews.[45:3]\r\n\r\n(5) The Zealots, led by Judas of Galilee, a sort of a nationalistic\r\nparty, were imbued by a very materialistic conception of the hope of\r\nIsrael. They sprang from the Pharisees and followed them in religious\r\nthings. They confidently expected the realisation of the kingdom of God,\r\nthe Messiah, and a new Israel. In their patriotic zeal they did not\r\nhesitate to use the sword and dagger to drive out their Roman foes in\r\norder to realise their dreams for a purely Jewish kingdom. Their\r\nfollowers came mostly from the lowest classes.[45:4]\r\n\r\n(6) The common people accepted the Pharisees, in a general way, as\r\nleaders. They believed in tradition and in the resurrection, but they\r\nwere prone to neglect the law and formalism so stoutly insisted upon by\r\nthe scribes. This class of Jews had a vital, living fellowship with God,\r\nand might be called pietists. Such characters as Simeon and Anna,\r\nZachariah and Elizabeth, Joseph and Mary, and most of those influenced\r\nby John's call to repentance were of this class. They stood for the pure\r\nreligion of the early prophets, and in a way opposed the sacerdotalism\r\nof the Jewish Church. They were in a spiritual and ethical mood to\r\naccept the great teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, and were consequently\r\nhis first converts. While they constituted the majority of the Jews, and\r\nwere scattered all over the Roman Empire yet they were not organised as\r\na political party. To these Christianity meant a great and much needed\r\nreformation.[46:1]\r\n\r\nThe moral condition of the Empire, east and west, makes a dark picture\r\nas drawn by such men as Paul,[46:2] Seneca,[46:3] Tacitus,[46:4]\r\nJuvenal, Persius, and Sallust. \"The world is full of crimes and vices\"\r\nmoaned Seneca. Foreign conquest and plunder brought in their wake\r\nluxury, sensuality, cruelty, and licentiousness. Slavery was fostered;\r\ninfanticide tolerated; marriage lax, and divorce shamefully common.\r\nAmusements became bloody and brutal; 20,000 lives were sacrificed in one\r\nmonth to appease the populace, who cared only for \"panem et circenses.\"\r\nThe stern virtue and morality of old Greece and Rome were dead. The huge\r\nEmpire was a giant body without a soul going to final destruction.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, then, that forces both positive and negative were at work\r\nto prepare the civilised world for the reception of Christianity:\r\n\r\n(1) The universal Empire of Rome was a positive groundwork for the\r\nuniversal empire of the Gospel. The imperial organisation suggested a\r\nform of organisation for the Church, so that Latin Christianity was\r\nsimply Rome baptised. The unity of the Empire afforded concrete\r\nillustration of God's spiritual kingdom, and implied fatherhood and\r\nbrotherhood.[47:1] Imperial toleration of harmless provincial religions\r\nprotected Christianity, and thus enabled it to get a foothold before\r\npersecution came. Universal peace also was a boon to the Christian\r\ncrusade.\r\n\r\nThe flourishing commerce, the good roads uniting the Empire, the\r\nextensive travel, and the various military expeditions all made the\r\nspread of new ideas easier and quicker.\r\n\r\n(2) Pagan theology became a stepping-stone to Christian theology.[47:2]\r\nThe decay of polytheism, because of its unspiritual and unsatisfying\r\ncharacter, made spiritual monotheism acceptable. Pagan temples, priests,\r\nand rites made the conception of, and the transition to, Christianity\r\neasier. Even the low moral condition and widespread skepticism strongly\r\nemphasised the need of a better religion.\r\n\r\n(3) The schools of the Empire prepared men's minds for an intellectual\r\nconsideration of the new faith, though not necessarily for its adoption.\r\nThe Greek and Latin tongues were excellent mediums for propagating the\r\nnew doctrines. Greek particularly was excellent for the expression of\r\nabstract and lofty truth, and the Old Testament had been translated into\r\nit more than two centuries before Jesus.[48:1] Grecian eloquence became\r\nthe model for sacred oratory. The philosophy of Plato and Aristotle\r\nformed the scientific basis for Christian theology. The spiritual\r\nflights of Plato,[48:2] the religious reflections of Plutarch, and the\r\nmoral precepts of Seneca were all used as arguments of revealed\r\nreligion. Even pagan art, with its love for the beautiful, was early\r\nemployed to give material expression to Christian ideas.\r\n\r\n(4) The Jews, scattered over the world,[48:3] befriended by Julius\r\nCæsar, given legal status as a sect by Augustus, expelled in vain by\r\nTiberius and Claudius, spread a knowledge of the living God over the\r\nwhole Empire before Christ appeared. Synagogues were numerous, and many\r\nGentiles became converts to monotheism.[48:4] These converts were the\r\nfirst to accept the teachings of Jesus, and in this way formed the\r\n_nuclei_ of the Christian Church.\r\n\r\nThus Jerusalem the Holy City, Athens the city of culture, and Rome the\r\ncity of power, combined to prepare the world so that the matchless\r\nethical and religious teaching of Jesus of Nazareth could capture the\r\nhearts and heads of men, replace the national religions, and become\r\nrealised in the outward forms and inward beliefs of the Christian\r\nChurch, which was soon to exercise a controlling power in the civilised\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nA.--PRIMARY:\r\n\r\n    I.--JEWISH:\r\n\r\n     1.--_Old Testament._\r\n\r\n     2.--_Old Testament Apocrypha._ Transl. by E.

II.--Spread of\r\n     the Apostolic Church. III.--Organisation of the Early Church.\r\n     IV.--Conclusions. V.--Sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Christian Church has both an internal and an external side--a soul\r\nand a body. Thoughts, feelings, and beliefs constitute the inner Church,\r\nthe creed. These, in turn, aided by physical conditions, determine the\r\noutward organisation of the Church. In a broad sense the Church was a\r\nproduct of certain forces already in the world at the opening of the\r\nChristian era, which were utilised by the believers in the teachings of\r\nJesus. From pagan and Jewish sources contributions were made to both the\r\nform and content of the Christian Church in the following ways:\r\n\r\n1. The Jews[52:1] gave in ideas: (a) a belief in Jehovah as God, (b) the\r\nconception of sin, (c) a consciousness of the need of repentance and\r\nreconciliation, (d) the doctrine of immortality, (e) the conception of\r\nHeaven and Hell, (f) angels and the devil, (g) miracles, (h) the Old\r\nTestament as God's word, and (i) the Sabbath. To the form of the\r\nChristian Church they suggested: (a) the synagogue, (b) officials like\r\nthe elders, (c) ceremonies, (d) feasts,[53:1] and (e) organisation.[53:2]\r\n\r\n2. The pagans contributed in ideas: (a) Greek philosophy and\r\nculture,[53:3] (b) concepts of morality,[53:4] (c) the idea of absolute\r\nsovereignty, and (d) universality.[53:5] In form they gave: (a)\r\nlocal organisations like the democratic Hellenistic guild or\r\nmunicipality,[53:6] or the numerous Roman social or religious\r\nassociations known as _collegia_ and _sodalitia_ (especially the\r\n_collegia funeraticia_), and the general organisation of the\r\nEmpire[53:7]; (b) rites and ceremonies; (c) the evening meal,[53:8] (d)\r\nfestivals like Easter and Christmas; (e) the use of images, and (f)\r\narchitecture, painting, and ornamentation.\r\n\r\n3. The real founder of the Church, however, was Jesus Christ. He\r\nsupplied the fundamental ideas of: (a) the universal fatherhood of God,\r\n(b) the divine sonship of the Saviour of the world, (c) the brotherhood\r\nof man, and (d) the ethical law of self-sacrifice. He created the\r\nChurch: (a) by choosing twelve Apostles, by teaching them and by\r\ncommissioning them to continue the work; (b) by winning a number of\r\nconverts to His doctrines; (c) by leaving certain sacraments for His\r\nfollowers--Catholics say seven; most Protestants, two. But He left no\r\nwritten Church constitution giving the details of organisation. The\r\nwork of Jesus and His immediate followers in founding the Church is\r\ndescribed in the New Testament. Broadly, then, the Church of Jesus\r\nChrist is composed of all the believers in the teachings of Jesus,\r\nalthough differing greatly in interpretation and in organisation.[54:1]\r\n\r\nFrom Jerusalem the Apostles and disciples of Jesus spread his teachings\r\nto Syria, Asia Minor, Africa, Greece, and Rome. From these fields the\r\npropagation was continued until by the time of Constantine every point\r\nwithin and some places without the Empire were reached. \"Throughout\r\nevery city and village,\" enthusiastically exclaimed Eusebius, \"churches\r\nwere quickly established and filled with members from every\r\npeople.\"[54:2] The fruitful labours of Paul and Timothy were explained\r\nthus: \"And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased\r\nin numbers daily.\"[54:3] Other Apostles were, no doubt, equally active\r\nin various parts of the Empire. The \"Christians\"--a term of derision\r\nfirst used by the heathen of Antioch,[54:4]--numbering 500 in 30\r\nA.D.,[54:5] grew to 500,000 by 100 A.D.,[54:6] and increased to\r\n30,000,000 by 311 A.D.[54:7]--a growth almost unparalleled in the\r\nworld's religious history. They included all the social classes in the\r\nEmpire from slave to Emperor, though the great middle class was in all\r\nprobability most numerously represented.[55:1]\r\n\r\nThe causes for this marvellous growth[55:2] are found in: (a) the\r\nrevolutionary teachings of Jesus, particularly the idea of immortality,\r\nwhich was very vague in heathen minds, and the law of love and\r\nself-sacrifice; (b) the miraculous powers attributed to the first\r\nChristians; (c) the purer and austerer morality of the early Christians;\r\n(d) the unity and discipline of the Church, making it a powerful\r\norganisation within the Empire; (e) the preparation and ripeness of the\r\nEmpire for Christianity, and (f) the subjective vividness of the\r\nconstant presence of Jesus with the early Christians, as explained by\r\nPaul, and their zealous propagandism.\r\n\r\nThe results of this new life, brought into the world so dramatically,\r\nmust be measured in terms of all subsequent history.[55:3] Every\r\ninstitution in the Empire was modified by this new spiritual force[55:4]\r\nso that as old pagan imperial Rome gradually fell, new Christian Rome\r\ntook its place to rule all western Europe for more than a thousand years\r\nin every sphere of human activity and endeavour.\r\n\r\nThe exact form of the organisation of the early Christian Church is\r\nextremely difficult to determine, because of the lack of sufficient\r\npositive authority in the New Testament and in patristic literature. The\r\nActs of the Apostles and the letters of Paul and others to the first\r\nChristian communities tell nearly all any one can know about the origin\r\nand organisation of the Apostolic Church. From these sources it is clear\r\nthat Jesus left certain great teachings, and many devoted believers in\r\nthose truths. After His departure, the Apostles, not limited to\r\ntwelve,[56:1] receiving authority directly from the Master,[56:2] like\r\nthe prophets of old, spread the new pregnant faith over the world,\r\norganised their converts according to individual ideas and local\r\nneeds,[56:3] and practically monopolised all direction of the\r\nChurch.[56:4] With the increase of these Christian societies in size and\r\nnumbers, came the necessity of appointing local officers, or of having\r\nthem elected by the \"brethren.\" In this way, at an early date, began the\r\noutward organisation of the Church. The development of the Jewish\r\nKingdom of God into the Ecclesia of the Christians was a comparatively\r\neasy transition, especially for the Jewish converts.\r\n\r\nNext to the Apostles in point of time, but not authority, in the\r\nBiblical account, came the deacons. At Jerusalem the Apostles had the\r\n\"brethren\" select \"seven men of honest report\" to minister to the poor\r\nand unfortunate, and to wait on the table in the daily love-feasts.[56:5]\r\nThey were installed by \"laying on of hands.\" This democratic example\r\napparently was followed elsewhere.[56:6] Both sexes were eligible.[56:7]\r\nThe high qualifications for the office suggest its importance.[56:8]\r\n\r\nSt. Paul tells us that the earliest Christian communities found\r\nit necessary to have some organisation, hence they chose bishops,\r\nor overseers, and presbyters, or elders. But throughout the New\r\nTestament the words elder, presbyter, and bishop seem to be used\r\ninterchangeably.[57:1] The qualifications for the offices were the same.\r\nBishops and elders are never joined together like bishops and deacons as\r\nif they were two distinct classes of officers. Timothy, for example,\r\nappoints bishops and deacons; Titus, elders and deacons. Paul sends\r\ngreetings to bishops and deacons at Philippi, but omits all mention of\r\nelders and presbyters because, presumably, they were included in the\r\nconception of bishops.[57:2] In his pastoral epistles he describes all\r\nChurch officers, but mentions only two classes, bishops or elders, and\r\ndeacons.[57:3] Peter, who calls himself \"also an elder,\" urges the\r\nelders to \"tend the flock of God\" and to \"fulfil the office of\r\nbishop.\"[57:4] Even Clement of Rome uses bishop and presbyter\r\ninterchangeably as late as 95 A.D.[57:5] Irenæus (d. 190) and Tertullian\r\n(d. 220), however, were conscious of a distinct division and\r\ndifferentiation.\r\n\r\nThat the official titles, bishop and presbyter or elder, were used from\r\nearly apostolic days, all must admit, for the New Testament evidence is\r\nunmistakable. But perplexity and doubt arise at once when an attempt is\r\nmade to determine the resemblances and differences in their duties and\r\npowers. The term elder, or presbyter, may have been used merely to\r\ndesignate the personal relation of the most highly respected members to\r\nthe congregation, while the name bishop, or overseer, may have been the\r\nofficial designation of leadership. Indeed some scholars, like Hatch and\r\nHarnack, believe that the functions of presbyters and bishops were\r\ndistinct and different from the beginning. They assert that the college\r\nof presbyters assumed the leadership, or government proper, of the\r\nChristian community, with jurisdiction and disciplinary power, while the\r\nbishops had charge of the administration of the Church, including\r\nworship and finance, and were also largely occupied with charitable\r\nwork, in co-operation with the deacons, such as care for the sick, the\r\npoor, and strangers. According to this view each congregation was\r\norganised with three sets of officers, namely, deacons, presbyters, and\r\nbishops, from the very outset. Gradually, however, an amalgamation took\r\nplace. The bishops, with their practical information, received seats and\r\nvotes in the presbytery and finally came to fill the office of\r\npresidency.\r\n\r\nIt seems more probable, on the contrary, that these two titles simply\r\nsignify the twofold origin of the early Christians, namely, from the\r\nJews and the pagans. The word presbyter is of Hebraic derivation, while\r\nbishop is a pure Greek term. Consequently the tendency developed to use\r\npresbyter wherever the Hebrew element predominated, and, on the other\r\nhand, to employ bishop for Greek communities. It was but natural, too,\r\nthat these two terms should come to signify the same thing and should\r\ncome to be used interchangeably.\r\n\r\nThe derivation of these terms is not clear.[59:1] Both presbyter and\r\nbishop appear to have been in use in Syria and Asia Minor to designate\r\nofficers of municipal and private corporations. In Grecian civic\r\norganisations, the word bishop or superintendent was likewise commonly\r\nused. Then there were the well-known elders of the Jewish\r\nsynagogue,[59:2] and the senators of Roman municipalities--in fact a\r\nuniversal respect for seniority existed in the old world. It was very\r\nnatural, therefore, that the Christians should adopt the known forms,\r\nnames, and offices of those organisations with which they were\r\nfamiliar.[59:3] This method of procedure is precisely the one followed\r\nover the world to-day in propagating any idea through organised effort.\r\n\r\nThese elders were apparently organised into boards, or councils, for the\r\npurpose of better furthering the interests of the Church. They were not\r\nteachers at first so much as the administrators, or business managers,\r\nof the general concerns of the Church.[59:4] They helped to enact\r\nordinances[59:5]; discussed important questions with the Apostles and\r\nassisted them in every possible way; enforced discipline[59:6]; settled\r\ndisputes between Christians; and prayed for the sick and anointed\r\nthem.[59:7]\r\n\r\nThe first Christians, eagerly awaiting the literal second coming of\r\nChrist, and imbued with great enthusiasm for the Gospel, did not feel\r\nthe need of an elaborate constitution. But in time, as numbers\r\nincreased, as severe persecution fell upon the Christians, and as the\r\noriginal fervour and spirituality decreased with the conversion of so\r\nmany pagans, it became necessary to develop a regular system of Church\r\ngovernment, which would more effectively meet the new conditions. The\r\nfact of differentiation in organisation is easily established, because\r\nthe earliest and later forms may be determined with reasonable accuracy,\r\nbut the transitional process is much more difficult of comprehension.\r\nThis evolution, however, appears to have taken this course:\r\n\r\n1. The board of presbyters, at least in the larger congregations,\r\nnaturally and logically developed a head with a priority in rank. The\r\noffice of president was universal in contemporary Jewish associations,\r\nand in Roman and Greek organisations. The creation of a chairman of the\r\nadministrative body became a political necessity to expedite business,\r\nand to enforce discipline in the Christian societies. Moreover there was\r\nthe example of the Apostles, who actually designated officers to\r\ncontinue their work (a) of teaching the true doctrines,[60:1] (b) of\r\norganising new churches, (c) of ordaining deacons and elders, and (d) in\r\nacting as head of the whole congregation.[60:2] Hence this change was\r\nnatural, imperative, and easy; but the transition must have been gradual\r\nand must have lacked uniformity.\r\n\r\n2. The president of the board of presbyters came, in course of time, to\r\nhave a recognised supremacy in power as well as in rank, and the title\r\nof bishop was gradually restricted to his high office. After the death\r\nof the Apostles more duties devolved upon the president of the council,\r\nand it was in the course of things that the special word bishop, _i.\r\ne._, overseer or superintendent, should be applied to him. By the second\r\ncentury, at least, if not indeed before, the differentiation had begun\r\nand from that time on it can be plainly traced in the Church Fathers.\r\nJerome states that at Alexandria until the middle of the third century\r\nthe presbyters elected one of their number as president and called him\r\nbishop.[61:1] Hilarius says: \"Every bishop is a presbyter, but not every\r\npresbyter a bishop; for he only is bishop who is the primate among the\r\npresbyters.\"[61:2] Examples, secular and ecclesiastical, were not\r\nlacking to warrant the change: (a) the Old Testament priesthood, (b)\r\nChrist and his Apostles, (c) the Apostles and their appointees, (d) the\r\nEmperor and his officials. The bishop soon professed to occupy the place\r\nof an Apostle instead of Christ as earlier, hence arose the idea of an\r\n\"Apostolic seat\" and \"Apostolic succession.\"[61:3] He represented\r\nChristian unity of doctrine and discipline, and ruled over a recognised\r\nterritory--first a single church, then a city, then a province. From the\r\nbishop it was only another step to the archbishop, the metropolitan, the\r\npatriarch, and the Pope.\r\n\r\n3. The position of the presbyter changes, likewise, from that of the\r\nhighest officer in the Church to one subordinate (a) to the board of\r\nelders and then (b) to the bishop. This distinction once made between\r\nbishop and presbyter, there was a tendency for the bishops to usurp\r\nmore and more power, while the presbyters opposed it. The third century\r\nis full of these quarrels.[62:1] Here began the conflict between the\r\nprinciples of monarchy and aristocracy in the Church. Soon, from acting\r\nas a member of a council, the presbyter came to act alone under the\r\nbishop--_i. e._, the presbyter became a priest, just as the president\r\nbecame a bishop. Presbyters also assumed new functions: (a) \"ministry of\r\nthe word\" and (b) \"ministry of the sacraments.\" New detached communities\r\nwere ruled not infrequently by single presbyters under the city bishop.\r\nIndeed it seems that from the outset the smaller and weaker Christian\r\ncommunities were ruled by single elders.\r\n\r\n4. The status and functions of the deacon likewise were altered. At\r\nfirst he visited the sick and unfortunate, collected and disbursed alms,\r\nand reported on discipline. Stephen taught; Philip baptised. With the\r\ngrowth of Christian civilisation, however, institutions of\r\nrelief--hospitals, orphanages, infant asylums, almshouses, poorhouses,\r\nguest-houses, etc.--took the place of the earlier personal ministrations\r\nof the deacons. Each institution had its own head, not necessarily a\r\ndeacon. From being distributors of alms, therefore, the deacon first\r\nbecame an assistant of the bishop,[62:2] and later the chief helper of\r\nthe priest in the administration of the sacraments. With the\r\nmultiplication of the duties of this office came the archdeacons and\r\nsubdeacons.\r\n\r\n5. The many duties incident to a complex organisation gradually produced\r\na new set of subordinate officials--the minor orders: (a) lectors to\r\nread the Scriptures in public and to keep the books, (b) acolytes to\r\nassist the bishops, (c) exorcists to pray for those possessed of evil\r\nspirits, (d) janitors to care for the buildings and preserve order, (e)\r\nprecentors to conduct public praise service, (f) catechists to instruct\r\nthe catechumens, (g) interpreters to translate the Scripture\r\nlesson.[63:1]\r\n\r\n6. The clergy came to be distinct from the laity--a sacerdotal class was\r\ndeveloped. In the early Church the priesthood was universal, _i. e._,\r\nlaymen as well as Church officers could preach, baptise, administer the\r\nsacraments, and exercise discipline. The relation of clergy to laity was\r\nmerely that of leadership as in non-Christian organisations.\r\n\"Ordination\" simply meant appointment, and was used in civic\r\ninstallations, while \"laying on of hands\" was only a symbol of prayer\r\nand even used by the Jews for secular affairs.\r\n\r\nGradually, however, the tendency to put the Church officials above the\r\nlaity grew stronger until something akin to the Old Testament idea of\r\nthe priesthood was revived. By the fourth century the Church officers\r\nhad lost their primitive character and had become a separate class\r\nmediating between God and man. The causes of this separation are not\r\ndifficult to see, namely: (a) the peculiar duties of the Church\r\nofficials tended to give them a distinct character; (b) the persecutions\r\nto which the Roman government subjected them threw them into conspicuous\r\nrelief; (c) the legalisation of Christianity bestowed upon them a\r\ndistinct civil status, made them immune from public burdens like taxes\r\nand military service, exempted them from civil courts, and permitted\r\nthem to acquire property; and (d) the rise of asceticism forced the\r\nclergy to observe a code of morals different from that of the laity,\r\ndemanded celibacy, originated the badge of the tonsure, and created\r\nclergy-houses.\r\n\r\nThe laity were early organised in congregations. Membership in the\r\nChurch was open to all believers in Jesus. The election of officers was,\r\nfor the most part, democratic. The life of each congregation was\r\nsocialistic and communistic. All possessions were sold for the common\r\ngood and to create a common fund for the needy.[64:1] The members\r\nenjoyed a common evening meal and their common love-feast which was to\r\nthem the highest act of worship.[64:2] Disobedience, or infidelity,\r\nmight be punished by private admonition, public correction, and in\r\nstubborn cases excommunication.[64:3] But after the first century these\r\ncommunistic-democratic societies were gradually replaced by a\r\nhierarchical organisation with new or modified institutions. The\r\nmonarchio-episcopal principle of church government was gradually evolved\r\nbut, nevertheless, much of the primitive democracy remained. This\r\nevolution in the government of the Church may be clearly seen by the end\r\nof the second century.\r\n\r\nFrom this discussion these conclusions may be drawn:\r\n\r\n1. The New Testament does not furnish a satisfactory model for any one\r\ndistinct organisation of the Christian Church.\r\n\r\n2. In the New Testament, however, are found the germs from which sprang\r\ndeacons, priests, bishops, metropolitans, patriarchs, and popes.\r\n\r\n3. The elements from which the Church was organised already existed in\r\nlarge measure in human society. Hence the Church, in its outward form,\r\nhad a natural historical growth and was influenced by (a) the Jewish\r\nsynagogue, (b) Greek municipalities, (c) the Roman government, (d) local\r\nneeds, and (e) the conditions of the times. The animating principle and\r\ncausal inspiration was Christianity.\r\n\r\n4. Christian society, like human society, was subject to constant change\r\nwhich is easily detected. The form of organisation, originally\r\ndemocratic, was gradually changed by the force of circumstances until it\r\nbecame monarchial and at the same time the officers underwent a similar\r\ntransformation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nA.--PRIMARY:\r\n\r\n    I.--JEWISH:\r\n\r\n     1.--Josephus, _Jewish War_, _Against Apion_, _Autobiography_,\r\n          Whiston ed.\r\n\r\n     2.--Philo Judæus. _Works._ 4 vols.

VI.--Sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nReports concerning the teachings and labours of Jesus must have early\r\nreached Rome.[71:1] A perpetual stream of strangers and provincials\r\nflowed into Rome from every quarter of the Empire, hence every new\r\ncreed, theory, and organisation was soon known in the capital.[71:2]\r\nRoman merchants, sailors, soldiers, or public officials, or the Jews, or\r\nthe Greeks, might have carried news of the new sect to the heart of\r\nimperial power. Tertullian mentions the legend that Emperor Tiberius\r\nsought to include Jesus among the Roman gods, but his plan was\r\nfrustrated by the Roman Senate.[71:3] Eusebius declared that this same\r\nruler, \"being obviously pleased with the doctrine,\" threatened \"death to\r\nthe accusers of the Christians.\"[71:4] It seems reasonable to conclude,\r\nthen, that Christianity, soon after its birth, was introduced into the\r\nEternal City.\r\n\r\nIt appears clear, too, that Christian converts were early won in Rome,\r\nor else migrated thither from other parts of the Empire. It is not at\r\nall improbable that many of these early Christians in the capital were\r\nJews.[72:1] Paul said that upon his arrival in Italy he \"found brethren\"\r\nat Puteoli and that a week later Christians came out of the city of Rome\r\nto greet him.[72:2] It is also quite probable that these various\r\nChristian communities in Italy had already created loose local\r\norganisations. Paul, during his prolonged stay in Rome, undoubtedly\r\nconverted many to the new faith and laboured to perfect their Church\r\norganisation.[72:3] The magnificent work done by this Apostle in\r\npromulgating the new faith throughout western Europe was sealed by a\r\nmartyr's death at Rome.[72:4]\r\n\r\nIt appears, also, that the Apostle Peter laboured at Rome, probably\r\nafter Paul, and completed the organisation of the Church. Tradition\r\nlikewise gives him a martyr's crown. The Roman Church, therefore,\r\nfounded by two Apostles and nourished by their heroic blood, was a\r\ndouble apostolic seat. This unusual origin, coupled with the fact of\r\nlocation in the heart of the world, together with a hundred other\r\ncauses, made the Roman Church very conspicuous from the first and\r\nenabled it to become the determining factor in Western civilisation for\r\nfifteen hundred years. Under these circumstances it was but natural that\r\nthe head of the Roman Church should come to have superior respect,\r\nprimacy in rank, and leadership in power, first in Italy, and then\r\nthroughout western Europe.\r\n\r\nThe mother Church in Rome was imbued with great missionary zeal, and\r\nspread the new faith with extraordinary rapidity. In 64 A.D. the\r\nChristians in Rome, according to the heathen historian Tacitus,\r\nconstituted a \"huge multitude.\"[73:1] By 250 the Roman bishop ruled over\r\nforty-six presbyters, seven deacons, seven sub-deacons, forty-two\r\nacolytes, and fifty readers, exorcists, and porters.[73:2] The\r\nChristians in Rome, a city of possibly one million, numbered at least\r\nfifty thousand as estimated by Gibbon[73:3] and possibly three times\r\nthat many as reckoned by later investigators.[73:4] Optatus, Bishop of\r\nMileve in Numidia, asserted that in 300 there were forty churches in the\r\nEternal City. While possibly a few churches may have been planted in\r\nwestern Europe independently, just as in Rome, still, in general,\r\nChristianity was disseminated throughout western Europe and the western\r\npart of northern Africa through the apostolic organisation in the\r\ncapital city. Paul may have even made a visit to Spain.[73:5] Bede says\r\nthat King Lucius asked the Roman bishop in 156 to send missionaries to\r\nBritain[73:6] and Tertullian confirmed the declaration.[73:7] In France\r\na church was planted at Lyons in 177 and another at Vienne.[73:8] In the\r\nthird century, asserts Gregory of Tours, seven Roman missionaries went\r\nto Gaul and there became seven bishops with subordinate churches. The\r\nfamous St. Denis of Paris was one of these pioneers.[74:1] Christianity\r\nwas likewise early carried into Germany (cis-Rhenana)[74:2] and across\r\nthe Mediterranean to north-western Africa.[74:3] It is a matter of no\r\ngreat surprise, therefore, to see the Roman Church revered as the great\r\nmother Church of the West. Paul speaks of the faith of Rome as\r\n\"proclaimed throughout the whole world.\"[74:4]\r\n\r\nThe process of Church organisation at Rome was no doubt quite similar to\r\nthat described in the preceding chapter, with this difference, however,\r\nthat the episcopal system was either present from the time Peter and\r\nPaul appointed a successor, or at least began very early. Through his\r\npresbyters, or priests, the Bishop of Rome at first ruled over a number\r\nof separate communities in the city. As the faithful spread the gospel\r\nbeyond the walls, churches were organised in the villages and\r\njurisdiction over them became vested in priests sent out by the bishops.\r\nIn time, however, the churches in the chief centres of population\r\ndemanded bishops of their own; they were appointed, or elected, under\r\ninfluence from Rome, and, consequently, acknowledged allegiance to the\r\nRoman See. There is incontrovertible evidence that by the fourth century\r\nevery city in Italy had a bishop. The village bishops naturally looked\r\nto the city bishops for assistance and advice. The city bishops\r\nsimilarly depended upon the bishop in the capital of the province, and\r\nthe provincial bishop in like manner recognised the superiority of the\r\nbishop in the capital of the Empire. Thus the power of the Roman bishop\r\nwas gradually extended first over Italy and then over western Europe.\r\nThe consciousness of a unity of belief, unity of interest, and unity of\r\npurpose developed comparatively early among the churches. A name for\r\nthis unity is first found in Ignatius and was the Universal or Catholic\r\nChurch.[75:1] Before long the Bishop of Rome was to claim, by divine\r\nappointment and arrangement, sovereign jurisdiction over the great\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\nThe classes won to the new faith in the city of Rome through the zeal of\r\nthe Roman Christians included representatives from the slave to the\r\nimperial family. The earliest converts may have been the Jews, who were\r\nquite numerous in the Eternal City, and who best understood the\r\nsignificance of Christianity. The hope and faith and love of the new\r\nteaching appealed powerfully to the lowest social classes--the wretched\r\nslave and the impoverished freedman.[75:2] The need and the truth of\r\nthis lofty, universal creed also won adherents from the great creative\r\nmiddle class--including not only the educated but also the soldiers,\r\ntradespeople, farmers, imperial officials, and skilled workmen. In fact\r\nthe marvellous vitality and the unparalleled growth of Christianity in\r\nRome can be explained satisfactorily only upon the supposition that the\r\nrepresentation of this class was very great.[75:3] From the nobility\r\nconverts were likewise secured and even in the Emperor's household\r\nfollowers were found.[76:1] In short, the whole social and moral\r\nstructure of Rome was leavened by the new ideas.\r\n\r\nAlong with this unparalleled growth of the power of the Roman bishop was\r\ncreated the Petrine theory destined to have a powerful effect on the\r\nhistory of the Church. Since an inquiry into this theory has a peculiar\r\nsignificance for the Roman Catholic, the Greek Catholic, and the\r\nProtestant, it is necessary to consider the subject rather carefully\r\nfrom the standpoint of both its advocates and opponents.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholic belief is that Jesus came to organise His Church on\r\nearth; that He appointed Peter to be his successor and head of the\r\nChurch; that Peter went to Rome, established the Church there in the\r\ngreat capital city, laboured as its head twenty-five years, and died\r\nthere as a martyr; that Peter transmitted his leadership and primacy to\r\nthe Bishop of Rome, whom he appointed as his successor, and who in turn\r\ntransferred it to succeeding popes; that the Roman Church, therefore, is\r\nthe only true Church, and that these contentions are conclusively proved\r\nfrom the Bible, the Church Fathers, traditions, and monuments.[76:2]\r\n\r\nThe Greek Catholic view coincides with Rome in asserting the divine\r\norigin of the Church. A certain honourable primacy is conceded to the\r\nApostle Peter; and to his successors at Rome, as patriarchs of the West,\r\nis granted a kind of supreme leadership in the Church. But the\r\npatriarchs of the East are put on an equality with the Pope of Rome, and\r\nthus the extreme claims of the Petrine theory are denied.\r\n\r\nProtestant opinion on the other hand takes two forms:\r\n\r\n1. The pro-Petrine view, held chiefly by the Episcopalians, maintains\r\nthat Jesus turned His Church over to all His Apostles; that upon their\r\ndeath they transmitted their leadership to succeeding bishops; that\r\nPeter was in Rome and, with Paul, helped to organise the Church there,\r\nand appointed a successor through whom apostolic power has been\r\ntransmitted to all bishops appointed by the Bishop of Rome, or by his\r\nappointees, where it now resides; that bishops and their successors\r\nappointed by Apostles other than Peter have just as much power as the\r\nBishop of Rome, because the fruits of Peter's work are merely the most\r\nmarked, but not necessarily the only divine or the most divine; that\r\nadequate proofs of this position are found in history, the Church\r\nFathers, and the Scriptures.\r\n\r\n2. The anti-Petrine view, taken by most Protestants, asserts that Jesus\r\nleft no Church organisation; that he did not appoint Peter as his\r\nsuccessor; that whatever leadership Peter had, came from his temperament\r\nand natural ability; that there is no positive proof of Peter's being in\r\nRome, consequently he could not have founded the Church there and named\r\na successor; that therefore the Roman Catholic Church is not the only\r\ntrue Church, and that abundant proof of this position can be supplied.\r\n\r\nIt may be well now to examine the proof offered in support of the\r\nPetrine theory under the four following heads:\r\n\r\n1. _Peter's primacy._ Jesus said to Peter, \"Thou art Peter, and upon\r\nthis rock I will build my Church; . . . And I will give unto thee the\r\nkeys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth\r\nshall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall\r\nbe loosed in heaven.\"[78:1] No such words were addressed to any other\r\nApostle, hence Peter is the foundation-stone of the Church. Just as God\r\nchanged Abram's name to Abraham, when he called him to be the father of\r\na mighty nation, so Jesus gave Peter a new name.[78:2] Peter was chosen\r\nto be present with James and John on important occasions, like the\r\nhealing of the daughter of Jairus[78:3]; the glorification of\r\nJesus[78:4]; the struggle in Gethsemane[78:5]; and on all these\r\noccasions Peter is named first in the record. He likewise was the first\r\nto whom the risen Christ appeared.[78:6] Before His ascension Jesus gave\r\nPeter charge over His whole fold--laity, priests, and bishops,--when He\r\ncommanded, \"Feed my sheep,\" and twice repeated, \"Feed my lambs.\"[78:7]\r\nThese facts are sufficient, it is believed, to warrant the belief that\r\nJesus appointed Peter to be the head of His Church.\r\n\r\n2. _Peter's exercise of his primacy._ Next to Jesus, he stands head and\r\nshoulders above all the other Apostles in his activity. The first twelve\r\nchapters of Acts are devoted to him. His name always comes first in the\r\nlists of Apostles, and Judas Iscariot's last.[79:1] He performed the\r\nfirst recorded miracle,[79:2] and was the first to address the Jews in\r\nJerusalem, while the other Apostles stood around to see three thousand\r\nconverted.[79:3] He was first to win converts from both the Jews[79:4]\r\nand from the Gentiles,--Cornelius and his friends.[79:5] He was the\r\nfirst to inflict ecclesiastical punishment on offenders.[79:6] He fought\r\nthe first heretic in the Christian Church.[79:7] He made the earliest\r\napostolic visitation of the churches.[79:8] When a successor to Judas\r\nwas chosen, Peter alone spoke, and the other Apostles silently acted on\r\nhis advice.[79:9] In the council of Jerusalem Peter first spoke, when\r\nthe disputes ceased and \"all the multitude kept silence\"; even James\r\nobeyed.[79:10] James was beheaded by Herod, but no tumult resulted.\r\nPeter was imprisoned about the same time, and the whole Church was\r\naroused about it.[79:11] St. Paul himself plainly admitted Peter's\r\npre-eminence.[79:12] These deeds clearly indicate, it is contended, that\r\nPeter consciously exercised the primacy bestowed upon him, and that his\r\nfellow Apostles recognised it.\r\n\r\n3. _Peter's visit to Rome, and martyrdom there._ Peter's First Epistle,\r\naddressed from \"Babylon,\" naturally interpreted, proves that he wrote\r\nit in Rome.[80:1] Clement of Rome (96 A.D.) said, \"Let us set before our\r\neyes the good Apostles,--Peter, who endured many labours, and having\r\nborne his witness, went to the appointed place of glory,\" etc.[80:2]\r\nIgnatius of Antioch (115), in a letter to the Romans, mentions Peter as\r\nhaving exhorted them. Papias (130) interpreted 1 Peter v., 13 to mean\r\nRome.[80:3] Dionysius, Bishop of Corinth (170), wrote Soter, Bishop of\r\nRome, about the common activity of Peter and Paul in Italy.[80:4]\r\nIrenæus (190) wrote, \"Matthew . . . published his Gospel while Peter and\r\nPaul were preaching at Rome, and founding the Church there.\"[80:5]\r\nClement of Alexandria (200) said that Peter, \"the elect, the chosen one,\r\nthe first of the disciples,\" preached at Rome.[80:6] Tertullian (200)\r\npositively asserted Peter's presence in Rome, and is the first to\r\ndescribe the manner of his death, in Nero's reign.[80:7] Origen (250)\r\ndeclared that Peter was the great foundation of the Church, and that \"at\r\nlast, having arrived in Rome, he was crucified, head downward, having\r\nhimself requested that he might so suffer.\"[80:8] Commodion (250) named\r\nPeter and Paul as Neronian martyrs; and Caius, a Roman presbyter (250),\r\nmakes a like assertion.[80:9] Cyprian (d. 258) was the first to call\r\nRome the _locum Petri_, while Hippolytus recorded Peter's conflict with\r\nSimon Magnus at Rome.[81:1] The Muratorian Canon referred to the\r\n\"passion of Peter\" in close connection with Paul's journey to\r\nRome.[81:2] Peter of Alexandria (306) believed Peter was crucified\r\nthere, and Lactantius accepted it as undoubted.[81:3] \"The Doctrine of\r\nAddai\" (fourth century) of the Syriac Church mentioned the \"Epistles of\r\nPaul which Simon Peter sent us from the City of Rome.\"[81:4] Eusebius,\r\nusing all previous testimony, made the most complete and convincing\r\nstatement, which caps the climax of the overwhelming proof.[81:5] The\r\n\"Deposito Martyrum\" gave the report of the removal of the two Apostles'\r\nbodies in 258 to the catacombs. Jerome (d. 420) added the information\r\nthat Peter laboured twenty-five years in Rome before his\r\nmartyrdom.[81:6]\r\n\r\n4. _Peter as the first Pope in Rome._ With the establishment of Peter's\r\nprimacy and his presence in Rome, it is certainly warrantable to\r\nconclude that he perfected the organisation of the Church there and\r\nserved as its head until his death, when he appointed a successor.\r\nClement (96) and Ignatius (115), Dionysius (170) and Irenæus (190),\r\nCommodion (250) and Lactantius (d. 330), all in speaking of Peter and\r\nPaul as founders of the Roman Church, always name Peter first. Ignatius\r\nspoke of the \"presidency\" of the Roman Church under Peter, and\r\nTertullian (b. 160) asserted that Jesus gave the keys to Peter, the\r\n\"Bishop of Bishops\" at Rome, and through him to the Church. Origen (d.\r\n254) called Peter \"the Prince of the Apostles\" and \"the great foundation\r\nof the Church.\" All the earliest lists of Popes began with Peter and\r\nindicate the transmission of his power.[82:1] Cyprian (d. 258) gave the\r\ncomplete statement of the primacy of the Roman bishop and the unity of\r\nthe Church through Peter and Jesus.[82:2]\r\n\r\nThis sums up, essentially, all the proofs offered in support of the\r\nPetrine theory, and constitutes, it must be confessed, a powerful and\r\nconsistent case.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary now, in the next place, to look at the evidence offered\r\nin opposition to the Petrine theory. For the sake of clearness, this\r\nevidence will be given under the four heads just employed:\r\n\r\n1. _Peter's primacy._ The famous passage, \"Thou art Peter,\" etc.,\r\ncorrectly interpreted, does not warrant a belief in Peter's primacy.\r\n\"Peter\" may mean \"rock\" (\"cephas\"), but it here refers to Christ, not\r\nPeter, or to Peter's confession, just made,[82:3] or to Peter's faith,\r\nor to Peter merely as a type of all the Apostles.[82:4] Furthermore the\r\ncommission to \"bind\" and to \"loose\" and the promise connected with it\r\nwere not intended exclusively for Peter but for all the Apostles[83:1];\r\nPeter stood only for a type.[83:2] The change of Peter's name does not\r\ncarry with it any special significance. Peter himself never mentioned\r\nhis primacy in his speeches or writings,[83:3] and nowhere else in the\r\nNew Testament is it distinctly stated or recognised by others. Whatever\r\nnatural capacity for leadership Peter may have possessed, it cannot be\r\nproved that he received an official primacy. Such a position would have\r\nconflicted likewise with the supremacy of Jesus.\r\n\r\n2. _Peter's exercise of his primacy._ The numerous instances where Peter\r\ntook the lead, or acted, or spoke first,[83:4] or where his name heads\r\nlists of Apostles,[83:5] merely show that he was a man of impulsive,\r\naggressive character, who would and did naturally take the lead in\r\npowers common to all the Apostles. At the council of Jerusalem Peter did\r\nnot preside, as he would have done if he was the recognised \"Prince of\r\nthe Apostles,\" but only made the first speech.[83:6] Paul would not have\r\nrebuked Peter to his face about some very important points had Peter\r\nbeen the recognised head of the Church.[83:7] Peter was a coward,\r\nbraggart, and traitor, and was reproved again and again by Jesus\r\nHimself,[83:8] who would not have chosen such a person to be the head of\r\nthe Church. There is not a single reference in the New Testament to\r\nshow that Peter ever attempted to exercise a primacy over his\r\ncompanions. He called himself a fellow \"elder.\"[84:1]\r\n\r\n3. _Peter's presence in Rome._ There is not a syllable in the New\r\nTestament to warrant the conclusion that Peter was in Rome. Inference\r\nalone makes \"Babylon\"[84:2] the Eternal City. On the contrary, there are\r\nimplications in the Scriptures that he was not in Rome. Paul in his\r\nEpistle to the Romans greeted all his friends, but said not a word about\r\nPeter. This would clearly indicate that Peter had not been in Rome\r\nbefore this Epistle was written, nor at the time it was written. Again\r\nin letters written from Rome, Paul is strangely silent about Peter's\r\npresence. The claim rests wholly upon tradition, therefore, and that is\r\nfar from conclusive. There is a significant silence from the time of 2\r\nPeter until that of Clement (96). Clement, to be sure, mentions Peter's\r\nmartyrdom; but it is only by inference that the place is Rome. Not until\r\nwell on in the second century did the legend about Peter's connection\r\nwith Rome begin to circulate, and not until the third century did\r\nTertullian assert positively that Peter was martyred in Rome under Nero.\r\nAfter that the assertion was generally accepted over the Church as a\r\ntruth.[84:3]\r\n\r\n4. _Peter as the first Roman Pope._ This, of course, is precluded by the\r\nwant of adequate evidence of Peter's presence and labours in Rome.\r\n\r\nThe evidence adduced here ends with the sweeping denial of every claim\r\nof the Petrine theory.\r\n\r\nHaving now stated the two sides of the question here still remains the\r\nduty of making the historical summary from the sources available,\r\nnamely, both the canonical and apocryphal books of the New Testament,\r\nand the traditional evidence in the Church Fathers. The New Testament,\r\nas the most important source of information, reveals Peter's\r\nbirthplace,[85:1] occupation,[85:2] marriage,[85:3] call by Jesus,[85:4]\r\nand elevation to apostleship.[85:5] It shows the conspicuous leadership\r\nof Peter in the apostolic college--indeed, a primacy which Jesus Himself\r\nrecognised,--yet leaves the character of that primacy and the power to\r\ntransfer it to a successor open to question. The New Testament evidence\r\ndoes not give any clue to Peter's movements after Paul's notice of him\r\nin Galatians ii. except the reference in 1 Peter, which naturally, but\r\nnot literally, interpreted might indicate that he was in Rome (Babylon).\r\nIt likewise affords very scanty grounds, therefore, for believing that\r\nPeter first established the Church in Rome, or that he was the first\r\nBishop of Rome, or that he conferred his power upon a successor.\r\n\r\nTraditional evidence, on the contrary, is more favourable to Peter's\r\npresence in Rome. No one can possibly doubt that the Petrine theory was\r\ngenerally believed in western Christendom at least after the third\r\ncentury. Prior to the third century, there are many streams of testimony\r\nwhich converge in positive support of at least a portion of the Petrine\r\ntheory:\r\n\r\n1. The official lists and records of the Roman Church, some of which\r\nmust rest upon earlier sources, accept the whole question as proved and\r\nrecognised generally.\r\n\r\n2. The transference of Peter's remains to a new resting place in 258\r\nshows that the tradition was definite and unquestioned early in the\r\nthird century.\r\n\r\n3. The writings of Caius, Origen, Clement of Alexandria, and Tertullian\r\nindicate that the theory was accepted in Asia, Alexandria, Carthage, and\r\nRome at the same period.\r\n\r\n4. A passage from Irenæus, who probably used the official documents in\r\nRome and who may have known St. John and his companions, carries the\r\nlegend back to the second century.\r\n\r\n5. The testimony of Dionysius of Corinth (d. 165), Papias, and Ignatius\r\n(d. 114) carries the belief back through the second to the first\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n6. The clear testimony of Clement of Rome makes a connecting link at the\r\nclose of the first century.\r\n\r\nHence when the various pieces of evidence--the official sources, the\r\nmonumental testimony, and the writings of the early Fathers,--which are\r\nindependent and consistent, are combined they form a solid body of\r\nproof, which is practically irresistible, that Peter was in Rome.\r\nLikewise the absolute absence of any rival tradition from other cities\r\nadds greatly to the probability.\r\n\r\nPeter's presence and death in Rome may be admitted as an established\r\nfact. If in Rome, whether one year or twenty-five years, Peter, with his\r\naggressive nature, with his marked ability for leadership, and with his\r\ncapacity for organisation, must have had a great deal to do with the\r\nestablishment of the Roman Church, either jointly with Paul, or\r\nindependently of him. Nor does it seem to be a misuse of the law of\r\nhistorical probabilities to assert that Peter, either with Paul or\r\nwithout him, appointed a bishop for the Church of Rome and transferred\r\nto that bishop his apostolic authority. From these facts, based almost\r\nentirely upon traditional evidence, coupled with the peculiar primacy\r\nconceded to Peter in the New Testament by his fellow Apostles, gradually\r\ndeveloped the Petrine theory with all its sweeping claims.\r\n\r\nThe admission of the belief that the Petrine theory is founded on\r\ncertain established facts, and not merely on fancies and myths, does not\r\ncarry with it the recognition of all the assertions which form a part of\r\nthat theory. Peter's unique leadership in the apostolic college, his\r\nactivity in founding the Roman Church, and his naming of a successor,\r\nwho in time became the Pope, may all be granted without carrying with it\r\nthe necessity of accepting the assertion that Christ chose Peter to be\r\nthe head of a definite, divinely-planned Church and that Peter,\r\nconscious of that great mission, went to the capital of the Roman\r\nEmpire, and there organised the only true Church on earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nA.--PRIMARY:\r\n\r\n    I.--CHRISTIAN:\r\n\r\n     1.--=New Testament= (27 canonical books).\r\n\r\n     2.--=New Testament Apocrypha= (see Chap.

III.--Causes and\r\n     motives of persecution by the Roman government. IV.--Number\r\n     and general character of the persecutions. V.--Results of\r\n     persecutions. VI.--Sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nReligious persecution originated long before the Christian era began--in\r\nfact it runs through the whole history of religion. In Rome all citizens\r\nwere required by law to conform to the Roman religion so that the gods\r\nwould protect the state. Refusal brought punishment, but always on\r\npolitical grounds.[91:1] Foreign religions which were either harmless or\r\nhelpful were often adopted, or at least tolerated.[91:2] Those, however,\r\nwhich were dangerous to public morality, social order, or political\r\nsecurity, and which were not tolerant of other religions, were severely\r\ntreated by the Roman government. This was the Roman legal principle of\r\nprocedure in the case of every such religion,[91:3] hence when\r\nChristianity appeared, Rome had already developed a distinct policy\r\nwhich first tolerated and then persecuted it.\r\n\r\nPersecution came to the Christians first from the Jews. Had not these\r\ndeserters of their fathers' faith precipitated Roman hatred upon the\r\nJews which resulted in persecution, expulsion, and loss of freedom and\r\nindependence?[92:1] Might not the Jewish religion be greatly weakened if\r\nthis proselyting continued? Hence the Christians were persecuted\r\nindividually and in masses.[92:2] The Jews sought in every possible way\r\nto incite the Roman authorities against the hated Christians.[92:3] This\r\nresulted in an irreparable breach between the two sects. The Christians\r\nwere brought into greater prominence, and the Romans even sought to\r\nprotect them from the Jewish fanatics.[92:4] At the same time a greater\r\nChristian zeal was aroused, and thus the spread of the new faith was\r\npromoted.\r\n\r\nThe Roman government tolerated the Christians at the outset, because\r\nthey were regarded as a harmless sect of Jews, whose work was quiet and\r\nunobtrusive.[92:5] The significance of Christianity was not understood,\r\nnor the marvellous spread of the faith noticed. Indeed Roman hostility\r\nto the Jews led at first to personal and official protection of the\r\nsupporters of the new faith, until the Jewish War in 70 A.D.\r\n\r\nThe Roman policy soon changed, however, from that of indifference, or\r\nprotection, to persecution. The causes for this change are: (1) The\r\npolitical science of the Roman Empire, and (2) the inherent character of\r\nChristianity.\r\n\r\nEthically the Roman state embodied the highest good, hence all human\r\ngood depended upon the integrity and security of the state. That\r\nprinciple subordinated the religious to the political, and made the\r\nEmperor the head of all recognised religions. Roman law upheld this\r\ntheory, as clearly stated by Cicero: \"No man shall have for himself\r\nparticular gods of his own; no man shall worship by himself new or\r\nforeign gods, unless they are recognised by the public laws.\"[93:1]\r\nJulius Paulus, a Roman citizen, stated the idea thus: \"Whoever\r\nintroduces new religions, the tendency and character of which are\r\nunknown, whereby the minds of men might be disturbed, should, if\r\nbelonging to the higher rank, be banished; if to the lower, punished\r\nwith death.\" Gaius said of forbidden associations: \"Neither a society,\r\nnor a college, nor any body of this kind, is conceded to all persons\r\npromiscuously; for this thing is regulated by laws, or codes of the\r\nSenate, and by imperial constitutions.\"[93:2] Hence from a legal\r\nstandpoint Christianity was illegal, because it introduced a new\r\nreligion not admitted into the class of _religiones licitæ_. \"You are\r\nnot permitted by the law,\" was the taunt of pagans.[93:3] To organise\r\nchurches and to hold unlicensed meetings were violations of Roman law.\r\nMight they not easily serve as covers for political plots? Mæcenas\r\nadvised Augustus: \"Worship the gods in all respects in accordance\r\nwith the laws of your country, and compel all others to do the same.\r\nBut hate and punish those who would introduce anything whatever alien\r\nto our customs in this particular . . . because such persons, by\r\nintroducing new divinities, mislead many to adopt foreign laws. Hence\r\nconspiracies and secret combinations--the last things to be borne in a\r\nmonarchy.\"[94:1] Roman citizens, therefore, who turned Christian were\r\ncriminals, outlaws, bandits, and traitors; consequently the best\r\nEmperors, those who felt called upon to enforce the law for the weal of\r\nthe Empire, those who wished to restore the vigour and power of old\r\nRome, sought to exterminate them, while the worst rulers were mostly\r\nindifferent, and in some instances tolerant.\r\n\r\nChristianity, inherently, was opposed to the whole governmental, social,\r\nand religious systems of Rome in the most offensive and uncompromising\r\nmanner. It advocated one God for all men, one universal kingdom, one\r\nbrotherhood of all men, and one plan of salvation. It was world-wide,\r\nabove the Emperor, and advocated a non-Roman unity. The Christians were\r\nsubjects of God's kingdom first, and the Emperor's next; and when Rome\r\nspurned this secondary allegiance they ceased to feel themselves Romans\r\nat all.[94:2] They refused the duties of loyal citizens, held no\r\noffices, objected to military service,[94:3] and refused to sacrifice\r\nto the honour of the Emperor.[95:1] \"Does not the Emperor punish you\r\njustly?\" asked Celsus. \"Should all do like you he would be left\r\nalone--there would be none to defend him. The rudest barbarians would\r\nmake themselves masters of the world.\" Furthermore the Christians\r\nclaimed the exclusive possession of divine knowledge and called all\r\nforms of pagan worship idolatrous.[95:2] Christianity itself was\r\nintolerant of all other religions. Was not Christianity the only true\r\nfaith? How then could the Christians compromise with false faiths, or\r\nconcede to them any truth, or any right to exist?[95:3] Hence it was\r\ninevitable, and Christians were keenly conscious of the fact, that a\r\nconflict should arise between Christianity and the Roman Empire, before\r\nthe universal dominion of the world could come. The efforts of imperial\r\nofficers to compromise matters, by insisting on mere outward conformity,\r\nmet with little success.\r\n\r\nThe attack made by paganism on Christianity came first from Roman\r\nphilosophers, scholars, and statesmen for all sorts of motives. Some\r\ndesired popular favour, others were sincere, still others sought to win\r\nimperial approval. Many, no doubt, even though they had no longer any\r\nheart for the ancient faith, yet could not bear to see it abolished.\r\nThey would agree with Cæcilius that \"Since all nations agree to\r\nrecognise the immortal gods, although their nature or their origin may\r\nbe uncertain, I cannot endure that any one swelling with audacity and\r\nsuch irreligious knowledge should strive to dissolve or weaken a\r\nreligion so old, so useful, so salutary.\"[96:1] Tacitus called\r\nChristians \"haters of mankind,\" and assailed their religion as a\r\n\"destructive superstition.\"[96:2] Suetonius denounced the new faith as a\r\n\"poisonous or malignant superstition.\" Others scoffed at these odd\r\ndevotees as \"dangerous infidels,\" \"enemies of Cæsar and of the Roman\r\npeople,\" and \"a reprobate, unlawful, desperate faction.\" Priests, driven\r\non by duty and possibly fearing the loss of their offices, added their\r\nsacred voices to the popular clamour.[96:3] Merchants and artists, whose\r\nlivelihood depended upon the sale of their products and wares to pagan\r\ntemples and worshippers, raised their voices against the new sect\r\n\"without altars, without temples, without images, and without\r\nsacrifices.\"[96:4] Then the populace, incited by the above-named\r\nclasses, took up the opposition and soon spread the wildest\r\nreports.[96:5]\r\n\r\nChristians were also declared to be responsible for every disaster like\r\nwar, famine, fire, pestilence, flood, earthquakes, death of prominent\r\npersons, etc. The gods, angered at the presence of such persons, sent\r\nthese dire calamities[96:6] on the atheists, who denied the many gods\r\nand worshipped but one, and who discarded all images--even that of the\r\nEmperor.[96:7] Did they not adore the wood of a cross and worship the\r\nhead of an ass?[97:1] Did they not refuse to conform to all religious\r\nobservances and festivals? Who but dangerous conspirators would hold\r\ntheir meetings in secret at night? These anarchists who refused all\r\ncivic service[97:2]; these social revolutionists who broke up family\r\nties,[97:3] set slave against master, taught robbery under the guise of\r\nequality, refused to enjoy the social games and festivals, and\r\ninterfered with business; these cannibals who ate the flesh and drank\r\nthe blood of their infants, the offspring of their incestuous and\r\nadulterous carousals--what punishment could be too severe for such\r\ndegenerates? Were they not a Jewish sect which had deserted the faith of\r\ntheir fathers, and which could command respect neither for age nor\r\nlegality?[97:4]\r\n\r\nThe occasion for the inevitable war between the Roman sword and the\r\nChristian cross was popular hatred and ridicule, and the frequent\r\noutbreaks of the mobs. The fundamental cause was political necessity,\r\nfor the Christians were guilty of _crimen læsæ majestatis_, high\r\ntreason. Christianity in the Roman Empire was somewhat like anarchy\r\nto-day in the United States in its relation to the state. The technical\r\ncharges made against the Christians were: (1) introducing a _religio\r\nillicita_, for which the penalty was death or banishment; (2) committing\r\n_læsa majestas_, for which the penalty was loss of social rank,\r\noutlawry, or death by sword, fire, or wild beasts; (3) being guilty of\r\n_sacrilegium_, for which the penalty was death by crucifixion, the ax,\r\nor wild beasts; (4) practising magic, for which the penalty was\r\ncrucifixion, or exposure to wild beasts in the circus.\r\n\r\nBoth the number and character of the persecutions seem to be\r\nmisunderstood. The Church Fathers and many later historians magnify the\r\nnumber, fierceness, and duration of the persecutions, and the number\r\nkilled.[98:1] On the contrary it seems that considerable time elapsed\r\nbefore the Christians were noticed by the government, which then\r\nproceeded against them with caution and reluctance and punished them in\r\ncomparative moderation.[98:2] The Church enjoyed many seasons of rest\r\nand peace. The number of Christians killed during the entire period of\r\npersecution was comparatively small.[98:3] The persecutions varied with\r\nthe whims and feelings of each Emperor--the best rulers like Trajan,\r\nMarcus Aurelius, Decius, and Diocletian, feeling the necessity of\r\nupholding the law, were the most energetic persecutors, while the worst\r\nEmperors were indifferent, or even favourable. The early persecutions\r\nwere only spasmodic outbreaks and limited; the later ones were general.\r\nThere is no reason for giving ten as the number of the persecutions--nor\r\nfor comparing them with the ten plagues of Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe first persecution occurred in Rome under Nero in 64 A.D.[99:1] Some\r\nhistorians contend that the Neronian persecution fell upon the Jews,\r\nwhom Tacitus, writing fifty years after the event, erroneously calls\r\nChristians.[99:2] Others maintain that the Jews, through court\r\ninfluence, shifted the punishment from themselves to the\r\nChristians.[99:3] Recent scholars, however, are inclined to accept the\r\nliteral narrative of Tacitus.[99:4] According to his version of the\r\nsituation, the persecution was accidental--a device of Nero to divert\r\nthe suspicion directed against himself of having burned Rome--and local,\r\nthat is, it did not extend to the provinces. A few Christians were\r\ntortured and compelled to confess themselves guilty of incendiarism and\r\nto give the names of others, and that led to the punishment of an\r\n\"ingens multitudo\" as Nero's scapegoats.[99:5] As a punishment for their\r\nalleged crime of incendiarism and \"hatred for the human race,\" they were\r\ncovered with the skins of wild beasts and torn to pieces by the dogs in\r\nthe circus, crucified by day, and burned as torches by night.[100:1]\r\nPaul, in all likelihood, fell a victim to this persecution and the Roman\r\nChurch has always believed that Peter also perished at this time.[100:2]\r\n\r\nAs a result, the attention of the Roman government was directed to these\r\n\"haters of the human race,\" and they became branded as outlaws and\r\nbrigands. Popular fury ran riot. A precedent was established, both in\r\nRome and the provinces, for punishing Christians for the name\r\nalone.[100:3] Nevertheless sympathy was won for them, they secretly\r\nincreased in numbers, and were compelled to adopt a better organisation\r\nin order to resist oppression. Above everything else the striking\r\ndifference between the Kingdom of God and the Empire of Cæsar was\r\nstrongly marked on the Christian conscience.\r\n\r\nAfter Nero's persecution, under the Flavian Emperors (68-96), there was\r\na standing law against Christianity, like that against brigandage, but\r\nit was only occasionally enforced.[100:4] There is no positive proof of\r\npersecution under Vespasian (69-79). Titus (79-81), however, continued\r\nthe policy of Nero.[100:5] Under Domitian (81-96) there was increased\r\nseverity in both Rome and the provinces. This may have been occasioned\r\nin part by the fact that as a result of the Jewish War all toleration\r\nfor the Jews was withdrawn. Christians were now classed with the hated\r\nJews. Flavius Clemens, the Emperor's cousin, was executed and his\r\nbeautiful wife Domitilla was banished.[101:1] Many others were killed,\r\ncompelled to fight wild beasts in the arena, or at least lost their\r\nproperty.[101:2] It was even reported that Domitian planned to have all\r\nthe relatives of Jesus slain in order to prevent the rise of a possible\r\nrival in the east.[101:3]\r\n\r\nOf \"the Five Good Emperors\" (96-180) who succeeded the Flavian rulers,\r\nthree continued the policy of persecution. The first, Nerva (96-98), was\r\ntolerant to the Christians. The next Emperor, Trajan (98-117), one of\r\nthe best Emperors, was not a wanton persecutor,[101:4] but felt it to be\r\nhis duty to uphold the laws and religion of the Empire.[101:5] He was\r\nreally the first Emperor to proceed against Christianity from a purely\r\nlegal point of view. By this time Christianity was clearly recognised as\r\na distinct sect and its real significance appreciated. His policy may be\r\nclearly seen in his correspondence with Pliny, the governor of Bithynia\r\n(112).[101:6] No doubt his views were influenced by Tacitus and Pliny,\r\nwho regarded Christianity as a \"bad and immoderate superstition.\" Still\r\nunder Trajan persecution was limited to Bithynia, Jerusalem, and\r\nAntioch, although Christianity had been formally proscribed everywhere,\r\ntogether with all secret societies. His attitude was the model for\r\npersecutions of the second century and later.[102:1]\r\n\r\nHadrian (117-138), who apparently judged Christianity rather trivially,\r\nissued the famous rescript which forbade riotous proceedings, on the one\r\nhand, and malicious information against the Christians on the other: \"If\r\nany one, therefore, accuses them and shows that they are doing anything\r\ncontrary to the laws, do you pass judgment according to the crime. But,\r\nby Hercules! if any one bring an accusation through mere calumny, decide\r\nin regard to his criminality and see to it that you inflict\r\npunishment.\"[102:2] Hadrian's adopted son and successor, Antoninus Pius\r\n(138-161), a wise, upright ruler, interfered to protect Christians at\r\nAthens and Thessalonica. His edict, given in Eusebius, is probably\r\nspurious, though the spirit may be correct.[102:3] Marcus Aurelius\r\n(161-180), an educated Stoic and an excellent Emperor, encouraged\r\npersecution against those guilty of \"sheer obstinacy.\" Public calamities\r\nhad again aroused the mob against the Christians. The imperial decree,\r\n\"not fit to be executed even against barbarous enemies,\" authorised the\r\nuse of torture to discover Christians and to compel them to recant, and\r\nalso ordered the confiscation of property. This order to seek out\r\nChristians, and not await formal complaints, seems to mark a new step\r\nin imperial legislation. Still persecution was not general, but confined\r\nto Lyons and Vienne in southern Gaul, and to Asia Minor.[103:1]\r\n\r\nThe period from 180 to 249 saw no essential changes.[103:2] Persecutions\r\nwere merely local, and depended more upon provincial feeling and the\r\ncharacter of the governor, than on the Emperor. Some of the Emperors\r\nwere friendly to the new religion, others quite hostile. Commodus\r\n(180-193), dissolute, timid, and cruel, was friendly to the Christians\r\nowing, probably, to the influence of his favourite concubine, Marcia,\r\nwho may have been a Christian.[103:3] Septimus Severus (193-211), an\r\nable soldier, was indifferent to the new faith up to 202, when he issued\r\na rescript forbidding pagans from becoming Christians, and enforced the\r\nold Trajan law with considerable severity.[103:4] Caracalla (211-217)\r\nand Heliogabalus (218-222), two of the most contemptible Roman rulers,\r\nboth tolerated Christianity. The former recalled banished Christians;\r\nthe latter sought to merge Christianity into his own elective system of\r\nreligion. Alexander Severus (222-235) actually gave Christianity a place\r\nin his cosmopolitan faith, had a bust of Jesus set up in his private\r\nchapel, allowed churches to be built, and protected the Christians.\r\nBut Christianity was not legalised. On the contrary, Ulpian, the great\r\njurist, collected for public use in case of need all the imperial laws\r\nagainst the new faith.[104:1] Maximinus the Thracian (235-238), a\r\ncoarse, brutal, military leader, ordered that all officers of the\r\nchurches should be \"put to death as responsible for the gospel\r\nteaching.\"[104:2] Philip the Arabian (244-248) was reported to be a\r\nChristian--at all events Christians were not punished during his\r\nrule.[104:3]\r\n\r\nThe last period of persecution (249-311) was characterised by civil and\r\nmoral decline in the Empire and by the amazing growth of Christianity,\r\nwhich had become bold and aggressive. It must either be exterminated, or\r\nelse adopted as the state religion. Hence the Emperors, who sought to\r\nrestore the old power and splendour of ancient Rome, showed the greatest\r\nseverity. Decius (249-251) issued the first edict of universal\r\npersecution (250) as a political necessity.[104:4] Local officials,\r\nunder the threat of severe penalties, were required to compel all\r\nChristians to conform to the state religion. Christians might flee, but\r\ntheir property was confiscated and their return meant death. The\r\ninquisitorial process was employed and penalties were severe, especially\r\nfor the leaders.[104:5] Decius declared that he would rather hear of the\r\nrise of a rival Emperor than of the appointment of a Roman\r\nbishop.[105:1] Valerian (253-260) was said at first to be \"mild and\r\nfriendly toward the men of God,\"[105:2] but public disasters and the\r\nadvice of his friends led him to renew the persecutions, so he issued an\r\nedict in 257 commanding Christians to conform to the state religion on\r\npain of banishment. The assembly of Christians was forbidden,[105:3] and\r\nthe bishops were banished. The next year he promulgated a second decree\r\nmore sanguinary than that of Decius, because it condemned all bishops,\r\npriests, and deacons to death.[105:4] Gallienus (260-268) recalled the\r\nexiled Christians, restored their church property, and forbade further\r\npersecution,[105:5] but Aurelian (270-275) ordered the old laws enforced\r\nwith renewed vigour.[105:6] His death, however, prevented the execution\r\nof the order; and thus the Christians had about forty years of peace.\r\n\r\nUnder Diocletian (284-305), a warrior statesman, occurred the last,\r\nlongest, and harshest persecution.[105:7] It was mildest in the West and\r\nworst in Syria and Egypt, and endured ten years. This Emperor,\r\napparently, took up the sword very reluctantly. In 287 he issued a\r\ndecree against the Manichæans in Egypt which was a general condemnation\r\nof Christianity. In 295 all soldiers were ordered to sacrifice on pain\r\nof expulsion, or, in obstinate cases, execution. In 303 Christians were\r\naccused of burning the imperial palace at Nicomedia and suffered\r\naccordingly. An imperial edict commanded the churches to \"be razed to\r\nthe ground, the Scriptures destroyed by fire,\" Christian officials\r\ndegraded, Christian servants enslaved, bishops imprisoned and forced to\r\nsacrifice, and torture employed to compel Christians to conform.[106:1]\r\nEverywhere these laws were executed, Eusebius says, with great severity\r\nuntil checked by the edict of limited toleration by Galerius and his\r\nco-regents in 311,[106:2] and stopped by the decree of complete\r\ntoleration granted by Constantine in 313[106:3] after a glorious\r\nstruggle of 250 years.\r\n\r\nThe results of the persecutions were very marked and have been both\r\nexaggerated and ignored:\r\n\r\n1. The growth of Christianity was helped rather than hindered.\r\nPersecution advertised the new belief and won sympathy. It created an\r\nintense devotion to the cause, proved the truth of the religion, and\r\nmade a martyr's crown desirable. Tertullian exclaimed: \"Go on! rack,\r\ntorture, grind us to powder; our members increase in proportion as you\r\nmow us down. The blood of Christians is their harvest seed. Your very\r\nobstinacy is a teacher. For who is not incited by a consideration of it\r\nto enquire what there is in the core of the matter? And who, after\r\nhaving joined us, does not long to suffer?\" The period of persecution\r\nended with a conquest of the Emperor and a large part of the Empire. The\r\nvictory was thus a double one.\r\n\r\n2. The organisation of the Church was effected. Persecution forced the\r\nChurch to organise itself more efficiently, produced responsible\r\nleaders, who were forced to direct the struggle against Rome and who, as\r\na result, were given pre-eminence by special punishment, and developed\r\nthe monarchio-episcopal system. The extraordinary development of the\r\npower of the Bishop of Rome, in particular, was influenced to a far\r\ngreater degree than is ordinarily taken into account. Much emphasis has\r\nbeen laid on the fact that that epoch of outlawry ended by the adoption\r\nof Christianity by the Empire. A much more important result, however, is\r\nfound in the fact that Christianity, for weal or woe, adopted the Roman\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\n3. The Church was kept purer in belief and more united in form. The\r\nspiritual was magnified over the temporal. Common oppression joined\r\nChristians in common sympathy. The differences between Christianity and\r\npaganism were emphasised. With death over their heads the Christians\r\nthought little of life here but much of that hereafter and regulated\r\ntheir lives accordingly. Still the growing consciousness that the Church\r\nwas a world-wide institution must have been powerfully stimulated. With\r\nthe evolution of the idea of Christian unity appeared the conspicuous\r\nleadership of the Roman Church. Irenæus (d. 202) could declare that it\r\nwas \"a matter of necessity that every church should agree with this\r\nchurch, on account of its pre-eminent authority.\" Tertullian (c. 220)\r\nalso recognised the distinction of the Roman Church, though later he\r\nquestioned the validity of the Petrine claim. It was left to Cyprian (d.\r\n258) to give the first complete account of the Universal or Catholic\r\nChurch in his work on the _Unity of the Church_.\r\n\r\n4. Persecution produced a group of extraordinary literary defenders like\r\nthe apologists, controversialists, and letter writers, and helped to\r\ndevelop the fundamental, orthodox Christian doctrine. It also produced\r\nmuch legendary poetry; and out of this baptism of blood was created the\r\nheroic age of the Church, based partly on fact and partly on fiction.\r\n\r\n5. The forms of worship were modified, the worship of saints and relics\r\nwas originated, and the priesthood was sanctified and set above the\r\nlaity.\r\n\r\n6. An example was furnished for later persecutions of the pagans,\r\nMohammedans, Jews, and heretics.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nA.--PRIMARY:\r\n\r\n    I.--CHRISTIAN.\r\n\r\n    1.--=New Testament.=\r\n\r\n    2.--=Church Fathers.=\r\n\r\n       1.--Clement, _Ep. to Cor._, ch. 5-7.

VI.--Constantine's historical\r\n     significance. VII.--Sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo understand the great changes that took place in the Christian Church\r\nunder Constantine, it is necessary to keep distinctly in mind both the\r\nstatus of Christianity, on the one hand, and the general conditions of\r\nthe Empire, on the other.\r\n\r\nIn territorial extent the Empire still formed a huge fringe around the\r\nMediterranean Sea and had lost but little of its vastness under Trajan\r\n(98-117). Under Diocletian (284-305) the Empire became an undisguised\r\noriental despotism. The administration was divided between two Augusti,\r\neach of whom had an associate, called Cæsar. This division of rule, with\r\nits increased expense, aroused much jealousy and discontent, and greatly\r\nweakened the Empire. As many as six rival Emperors appeared at once, and\r\nout of the rivalry emerged Constantine the Great as the sole ruler of\r\nthe Empire. Wars with the Persians in the east and with the barbarians\r\non the north accelerated the declining political morality. At the same\r\ntime social classes became more marked, and moral standards lower.\r\nSchools were neglected, literature became superficial, poetry lost its\r\nvoice, and oratory declined. Paganism, largely a form of patriotism and\r\nnational festivity, still numbered many adherents, but it was not deeply\r\nrooted in their hearts.\r\n\r\nChristianity, in the face of outlawry and severe persecution, had spread\r\nsteadily and marvellously, and particularly among the substantial people\r\nof the Empire.[113:1] It is difficult to estimate the number of\r\nChristians because few records were left and the number of real\r\nbelievers was much larger than the professed adherents. The earlier\r\nestimates are probably too low. After more careful investigation,\r\n30,000,000 may be safely given as indicating the numerical strength of\r\nthe new creed.[113:2] When Constantine the Great appeared, therefore,\r\nold pagan Rome was declining, while a new Christian Rome was rapidly\r\nrising. Christianity would undoubtedly have gained the victory sooner or\r\nlater had Constantine not appeared as its champion.\r\n\r\nConstantine was born about 274 at Naïssus, in Upper Moesia. His father\r\nwas Constantius Chlorus, a nephew of Emperor Claudius, the conqueror of\r\nthe Goths, who was selected as Cæsar of the West possibly because of his\r\nimperial connection. His mother was Helena, the daughter of an\r\ninnkeeper, and not the fabled English princess. She was only a\r\nconcubine, who, however, was made a legal wife after the birth of\r\nConstantine.[113:3] She was a Christian, it seems, and no doubt taught\r\nthe new faith to both her husband and son.[114:1]\r\n\r\nConstantine's education was gained mostly in court circles and on the\r\nbattle-field. As a boy he was instructed in the schools of Drepanum in\r\nCilicia, his mother's birthplace, later changed to Helenapolis. Little\r\nis known about this phase of his training, and there are reasons for\r\nbelieving that it was not very comprehensive. In 292, when Constantine\r\nwas eighteen, his father became Cæsar of the West, divorced his mother,\r\nand sent him to be educated as a sort of hostage at the court of\r\nDiocletian at Nicomedia. There he acquired his preliminary military\r\ntraining and political education. With Diocletian he made an expedition\r\nto Egypt _via_ Palestine (296) and the next year joined Galerius in a\r\ncampaign against the Persians. He soon won a reputation as a bold\r\nwarrior, and became a popular leader. Indeed his superior ability\r\naroused the jealousy of Galerius, who purposely exposed him to the\r\ngravest dangers, thus hoping to get rid of him. After his military\r\nsuccess, he was made tribune of the first rank. Skilled in the art of\r\npolitics at the court of the Eastern rulers, and having won his spurs in\r\nbattle, he expected to be elevated to the office of Cæsar, when\r\nDiocletian resigned in 305, but was defeated by Galerius, who succeeded\r\nDiocletian as Augustus, and chose his own nephew as Cæsar. This was a\r\nkeen disappointment to young Constantine.[114:2]\r\n\r\nIn 305, Constantius Chlorus succeeded Maximian, who had resigned by\r\nagreement with Diocletian, as Augustus of the West, and, since there\r\nwas no reason why an Augustus should leave his son as hostage at the\r\ncourt of an equal, he demanded the return of Constantine. Galerius\r\nreluctantly consented, but before the official permit was executed,\r\nConstantine, fearing treachery, fled at night, maimed the post-horses to\r\nprevent pursuit, and reached Boulogne just in time to go with his father\r\nto Britain.[115:1]\r\n\r\nAfter an easy conquest of Britain, Constantius Chlorus died at York\r\n(July, 306), having named his son as his successor, whereupon the\r\nsoldiers immediately saluted Constantine as Augustus.[115:2] Although\r\nthis was the ancient practice, and Constantine was eligible for the\r\noffice both by heredity and by preparation, still, constitutionally, the\r\nnomination rested with Galerius, who, enraged at the usurpation, and\r\nalso at Constantine's shrewd diplomatic letter, allowed him only the\r\ntitle of Cæsar.[115:3] No man in the Empire was better fitted by age,\r\nappearance, previous training, and ability, for the higher office.\r\nBacked by his army, Constantine continued his father's policy to defend\r\nthe Gauls against the Franks and Germans, and to develop the prosperity\r\nof the country. He married Maximian's daughter (307) as a diplomatic\r\nprecaution and was recognised by him as Augustus. Meanwhile Maxentius,\r\nthe son of Maximian, who, discovered in conspiracy, had committed\r\nsuicide, had assumed the imperial purple at Rome and now took his\r\nfather's death as a pretext for war against Constantine.[115:4]\r\nEncouraged by a Roman embassy, Constantine at once hastily marched\r\ntoward Rome and at Milvian Bridge defeated his rival, who was drowned in\r\nthe Tiber (312). Constantine was now sole Emperor of the West. In 324\r\nLicinius was defeated in the East and Constantine had become Emperor of\r\nthe united Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nConstantine's connection with Christianity marks a new epoch in the\r\nhistory of the Church. Under him the new faith was legalised,\r\nemancipated, protected, and given lands and buildings. Constantine's\r\nmother, who was a Christian, probably gave him his first favourable\r\nimpressions of the outlawed religion. As a boy he must have heard it\r\ndiscussed as a topic for both light and serious conversation. At the\r\ncourt of Diocletian and Galerius he saw the edict of persecution\r\nproclaimed in 303 and must have witnessed the action of Christians under\r\nmartyrdom, noticed their marvellous growth in the face of outlawry and\r\npunishment, and perhaps came to look with some favour upon their\r\nteachings. When he succeeded his father as Emperor of the West, he\r\ncontinued his father's policy of toleration and let Diocletian's edict\r\nof persecution fall as a dead letter.[116:1]\r\n\r\nTradition tells us that Constantine was converted to Christianity\r\nsuddenly by a miracle. One day, during the conflict with Maxentius at\r\nMilvian Bridge, he and his whole army saw a bright cross in the heavens\r\nwith this inscription in Greek on it: \"In this sign, conquer.\" In a\r\ndream that night Christ appeared to him and commanded him to use the\r\nemblem of the cross as his battle ensign, and promised him victory in\r\nconsequence. Constantine immediately had the costly _labarum_ made to\r\nbe carried before his army and with it at Milvian Bridge, ten miles from\r\nRome, he vanquished his foe.[117:1]\r\n\r\nThree theories have been proposed to explain the spectacle of the cross:\r\n1. That it was a genuine miracle, supported by the following facts: (a)\r\nEusebius, who gives us the first account, had all the evidence directly\r\nfrom Constantine himself under oath; (b) Constantine's whole army\r\n\"witnessed the miracle and put the emblem on their shields\"[117:2]; (c)\r\nSocrates says the original standard could still be seen in his\r\nday.[117:3] The older historians all upheld the miracle, although few\r\nscholars to-day take that view.[117:4] 2. That it was a natural\r\nphenomenon coloured by Constantine's imagination, or an optical\r\nillusion, or a dream.[117:5] 3. That it was a pious fraud, deliberately\r\ninvented either by Constantine, or by Eusebius.[117:6] Whatever the\r\ntheories may be, the fact remains that for some reason Constantine\r\ninvoked the aid of the Christian's God, and carried the Christian emblem\r\nin front of his troops to one victory after another until he became sole\r\nruler of the Empire. If it was merely experimenting with the name and\r\ncross of Jesus, the experiment brought convincing belief, for the sacred\r\nemblem was employed in all later military campaigns.\r\n\r\nThe triumph over Maxentius at Milvian Bridge was a great victory for\r\nChristianity. Constantine had a statue of himself with a cross in his\r\nhands set up in Rome. An inscription on it stated that through\r\nChristianity the glory and freedom of Rome had been restored.[118:1]\r\nHenceforth Constantine extended imperial aid and protection to the\r\nChristians and a new era was opened in the history of the Christian\r\nChurch. He endowed and enlarged Christian churches in Rome and later\r\nelsewhere[118:2]; he wrote letters in behalf of Christians in\r\nAfrica[118:3]; he made Christian bishops, like Hosius, Lactantius, and\r\nEusebius, his trusted political advisers; and he enacted laws legalising\r\nthe new faith and protecting its adherents.\r\n\r\nThe edict of limited toleration passed by Galerius in 311, in\r\nconjunction with Constantine and Licinius, was very unsatisfactory. The\r\nChristians might rebuild their churches but were required to pray for\r\nthe Emperor.[118:4] A decided preference was shown to paganism since no\r\nperson was free to leave his own religion and join another. This was a\r\ngreat hardship, for many Romans were Christians at heart and were only\r\nwaiting for permission to join the new Church openly.[118:5] To meet the\r\nnew conditions and to afford the needed relief, Constantine, jointly\r\nwith Licinius, in 313 issued the Edict of Milan, the Magna Charta of\r\nreligious liberty. It was promulgated in Greek and Latin over the whole\r\nEmpire as imperial law. It did not make Christianity the state religion,\r\nas is generally asserted, but only legalised it, and popularised it. Now\r\npeople could and did openly desert the old and join the new faith.\r\nPersecutions were forbidden under severe penalties. Exiles were\r\nrecalled. Confiscated property was restored with compensation to the\r\npossessor. All Romans were exhorted to worship the Christian God. This\r\nfamous edict was significant, because it put Christianity on an equality\r\nwith paganism; gave it opportunity for public organisation, thus paving\r\nthe way for the Catholic hierarchy already begun; and marks a new era in\r\nthe history of the Christian Church, because at last a great Roman\r\nEmperor and his conquering army had taken up the sword in defence of\r\npersecuted Christianity.[119:1]\r\n\r\nThe proclamation of emancipation and protection was followed by other\r\nacts which clearly show that Constantine meant to favour and control the\r\nnew religion. The Christian clergy were exempted from military and\r\nmunicipal duties[119:2]--a favour already enjoyed by pagan priests and\r\neven Jewish rabbis (March, 313). The Church Council of Arles was\r\nconvoked (314). The emancipation of Christian slaves was facilitated\r\n(315). Various customs and ordinances offensive to Christians were\r\nabolished (316). Bequests to churches were legalised (321). The\r\ncessation of civic business on Sunday was enjoined, but as a \"dies\r\nSolis\" (321).[120:1] The heathen symbols of Jupiter, Apollo, Mars, and\r\nHercules were removed from imperial coins (323). In defeating Licinius\r\n(324), a bitter reactionist, Constantine felt that he was waging war in\r\nbehalf of Christianity.[120:2] In 324 Constantine issued a general\r\nexhortation to all Romans to embrace the new creed for the common weal.\r\nThe highest dignities were opened to Christians. Gifts and remission of\r\ntaxes enriched their churches. A craze for buildings led to the erection\r\nof churches at various sacred spots in the Holy Land, at Nicomedia, in\r\nConstantinople, in Rome, and elsewhere. Fifty costly manuscripts of the\r\nBible were ordered prepared for the leading churches. The Council of\r\nNicæa was held in 325, the Arian schism healed, and the first written\r\ncreed given the Church. Finally, by divine command, as it was said,\r\nConstantine removed his capital from old pagan Rome to Byzantium, the\r\nnew Christian Rome, which was renamed Constantinople (326). This left\r\nChristianity in the West, already strong and active, to organise itself\r\nunder the guidance of the Bishop of Rome, and powerfully aided the\r\nevolution of the papal hierarchy. In the East, under imperial\r\nprotection, the spread and organisation of the popular belief was\r\nphenomenal.\r\n\r\nPaganism was still legal, however; its institutions were not attacked\r\nand the privileges of its priests were confirmed. Nevertheless the\r\ntriumphs of Christianity were all won at the expense of paganism. As the\r\nnew faith arose the old sank, yet not without many a desperate and even\r\nnoble effort to persist. Individual cults which were either immoral or\r\noffensive, like that of Venus in Phœnicia, Æsculapius at Ægæ, and the\r\nNile-priests at Heliopolis, were prohibited.[121:1] Private haruspices\r\nwere forbidden. There is even some evidence of a general edict against\r\nsacrifices.[121:2] All of these things indicate the passing away of the\r\nold order and the birth of the new.\r\n\r\nOpinion about Constantine's character takes two extreme views. On the\r\none hand it is held that in 312 Constantine, like Paul, was miraculously\r\nconverted to Christianity and that from that day forth he was a saint\r\nincarnate. Eusebius, and later panegyrists like Mosheim, are responsible\r\nfor this picture. To this day the Greek churches celebrate his memory as\r\nSt. \"Equal of the Apostles.\" On the other hand it is asserted that he\r\nwas nothing but a shrewd politician, able to read the signs of the\r\ntimes, who assumed an outward connection with Christianity solely for\r\npolitical expediency. Zosimus, a pagan historian, gives the worst\r\naccount, ascribing to him the basest motive for every deed. Keim calls\r\nhim a political trickster, and Burckhardt styles him a \"murdering\r\negoist\" and \"politischer Rechner\" without a spark of Christianity.[121:3]\r\n\r\nWas Constantine a Christian? The query is a difficult one to answer\r\nbecause ten men would each give a different definition of the essentials\r\nof a Christian. The favourable evidence will be considered first.\r\nConstantine's activity in behalf of the new religion, already mentioned,\r\nshows at least his sympathy for it and no doubt his belief in it. His\r\nimperial laws, improving woman's condition, mitigating slavery,\r\nabolishing crucifixion as a method of punishment, and caring for the\r\nunfortunate, breathe forth the spirit of Christian justice and\r\nhumanity.[122:1] He tried to convert his subjects to Christianity\r\nthrough Christian governors in the provinces, by letters and sermons, by\r\nrewarding towns for converting temples into churches, and by conforming\r\nto Christian worship. He diligently attended divine services, had a\r\nstated hour and place for prayer, fasted, kept Easter vigils with great\r\ndevotion, and even invited his subjects to hear him preach on the folly\r\nof paganism and about the truth of Christianity. He exerted every effort\r\nto make Constantinople a Christian city--churches replaced altars, the\r\nimperial palace was adorned with biblical scenes,[122:2] gladiatorial\r\ncombats were prohibited, and the smoke of public sacrifice never rose\r\nfrom the hills of New Rome.[122:3] The imperial treasury was lavishly\r\nused to support Christianity.[122:4] Constantine's sons were given a\r\nChristian education. He believed in the efficacy of baptism, even though\r\nhe did postpone it to the end of his life--a common practice to wash\r\naway all sins. Besides he wished to be baptised in the river Jordan\r\nwhere Jesus himself was baptised. In 337 he was received into the Church\r\nas a catechumen, promised to live worthily as a follower of Jesus, was\r\nbaptised, and wore the white baptismal robe till he died.[122:5]\r\n\r\nThe unfavourable evidence submitted leads to the conclusion, held by\r\nsome historians, that Constantine's conversion was not genuine, but due\r\nto hypocrisy, superstition, or policy. He retained the title Pontifex\r\nMaximus, head of the old religion. The Edict of Milan protected paganism\r\nand he continued that policy. After defeating Maxentius at Milvian\r\nBridge he had his triumphal arch erected. The original inscription said\r\nthat he triumphed over his rival by the favour of Jupiter. But these\r\nwords were later erased and the neutral phrase \"instinctu Divinitas\"\r\nsubstituted.[123:1] In Rome he restored pagan temples and said: \"You who\r\nconsider it profitable to yourselves, continue to visit the public\r\naltars and temples and to observe your sacred rites.\"[123:2] Even in\r\nConstantinople temples were erected to the gods. The laws of 319 show\r\nthat sacrifice still existed--at least in private houses.[123:3] Pagan\r\nemblems were continued on imperial coins till 330. Constantine, as\r\nPontifex Maximus, continued to attend the sacred games connected with\r\nthe pagan religion,[123:4] and even used pagan rites along with\r\nChristian to dedicate his new capital.[123:5] In 321 he ordered that\r\nwhen lightning should strike the imperial palace, or any public\r\nbuilding, the soothsayers should be consulted to determine the cause as\r\nof old. The same year he employed heathen magic to heal diseases, to\r\nprotect crops, to prevent rain and hail, etc.[123:6] He retained many\r\npagans at court and in public office, and was very intimate with pagan\r\nphilosophers like Sopater.[124:1] In no document did he formally\r\nrenounce paganism and declare himself a Christian. He was guilty of\r\nweakness and crimes inconsistent with a Christian life. He was vain,\r\nsuspicious, despotic, and gained his ambitious ends through bloody wars.\r\nHe was undoubtedly guilty of murdering Licinius, his brother-in-law,\r\ncontrary to a sacred pledge; Licinius, the younger, his nephew, a boy of\r\neleven; Crispus, his eldest son, on the ground of treasonable\r\nconspiracy; and Fausta, his wife, for adultery.[124:2] To wipe away\r\nthese sins, and many others, he accepted at the close of his life the\r\nChristian rite of baptism. After his death the Senate voted to place him\r\namong the gods.[124:3]\r\n\r\nAfter weighing all evidence, these historical conclusions may be drawn:\r\n\r\n1. Constantine was primarily a statesman, and wisely used both paganism\r\nand Christianity to unite his Empire and to build up his autocratic\r\npower. He was Pontifex Maximus, not alone of paganism, but of all\r\nreligions.[124:4] The grateful Christians heartily granted that\r\nleadership. Up to 323 he kept the two religions equally balanced, but to\r\ndo so he was forced to favour Christianity most. After 323 he depressed\r\npaganism and exalted Christianity. Toward the end of his life he showed\r\na tendency to forcibly suppress the old religion.\r\n\r\n2. Constantine was a Christian, but not as a result of a miracle at\r\nMilvian Bridge. His conversion was a gradual result of many influences.\r\nTraining at his Christian mother's knee, paternal instruction, his\r\nyouthful observations at the Eastern imperial court, a growing belief in\r\nmonotheism, his discontent with the faith of his fathers and a proneness\r\ntoward sun-worship, and his religious philosophy, which led him to look\r\nat Christianity as a system of thought rather than a life creed--a law,\r\nnot a faith--a world-force of purity and simplicity--all these factors\r\nproduced within him a growing comprehension of the truth, power, and\r\nbeauty of Christianity. The cross in the sky and the consequent\r\nvictories led to a conviction that God had selected him as the champion\r\nof the new creed, \"the bishop of bishops.\" Contact with the leading\r\nChristians in the Empire, men of heart and brains, greatly increased his\r\nadmiration for Christianity and interest in it. Just when he became a\r\nChristian no one can say, but that he died a sincere believer one can\r\nhardly doubt.[125:1]\r\n\r\n3. He was a product of his age. He was actuated by both religious and\r\npolitical motives and was not merely an artful politician. It was not an\r\neasy thing to be a Roman Emperor and at the same time a Christian. He\r\nwas guilty of grave crimes, but they were the result of gusts of\r\npassion, like those of Peter the Great, and not of constitutional\r\ndepravity. Nor do these sins appear so enormous when considered in the\r\nlight of his long, useful career, the dynastic difficulties confronting\r\nhim, and the morality of many Christian leaders of the day. It must not\r\nbe forgotten that he was a converted heathen, that the Christian code\r\nhad not yet become the moral code, and that the integrity of the Empire\r\nstood above family ties and even religious demands.\r\n\r\n4. He made his age the beginning of a new era. He enabled Christianity\r\nto become the moulding spirit of Western civilisation. He was the first\r\nrepresentative of that theoretical Christian theocracy which makes the\r\nChurch and state two sides of God's government on earth. The Church and\r\nstate were to remain united throughout all the succeeding ages to the\r\npresent time. Even Protestant nations adopted the principle. Among the\r\nmost noteworthy exceptions to-day are the United States, Italy, and, but\r\nrecently, France. He founded the Byzantine Empire and bears the same\r\nrelation to the East that Charles the Great does to the West. He gave\r\nthe Church its first unity in organisation, its first universal council,\r\nand its first written creed. He stamped his own character on his age and\r\nmade it greater and happier. He has continued to live through succeeding\r\ncenturies by reason of what he was and what he did. For all these\r\nreasons, judged by achievement, the world unites in calling him \"the\r\nGreat.\"[126:1]\r\n\r\n5. Historically, Constantine's significance lies not in the fact that he\r\nwas a Christian, personally, but that he for the first time endowed the\r\nnew religion with that worldly power which made it for over one thousand\r\nyears the most powerful moral, social, and political agency the world\r\nhas seen. Constantine the Great was succeeded by Charles the Great, and\r\nhe in turn by Otto the Great. On the ruins of the Christianised Roman\r\nEmpire arose the Roman Empire of the Germans, and in this the work of\r\nConstantine was really completed. Not until the Reformation and the\r\nModern Age did the cry arise that the work of Constantine must be\r\nundone.\r\n\r\nConstantine's three sons and successors continued his policy. Laws were\r\npassed favourable to Christianity. Paganism was still tolerated, but the\r\ntendency to suppress it had developed into a fixed policy. Sacrifices\r\nwere forbidden on pain of death and confiscation in 352.[127:1] The\r\npersecuted, in turn, became the persecutors. \"Emperors!\" one of the\r\nChristian leaders advised, \"the temples must be overthrown and utterly\r\ndestroyed in order that the pernicious error may no longer pollute the\r\nRoman world. The Supreme God has committed the Government to you, so\r\nthat you may cure this cancer.\" Pagan temples were converted into\r\nChristian churches. Unity of worship and unity of imperial rule were\r\ndeclared to be essential. Pagan opposition to religious unity under the\r\nEmperor was now interpreted as treason just as Christianity was so\r\nregarded before 311. Thus identified with the Empire, Christianity\r\nbecame the popular dominant faith. Rome and Alexandria alone clung to\r\nthe old gods.[127:2]\r\n\r\nUnder Julian (361-363), a nephew of Constantine the Great, paganism made\r\none last supreme effort for mastery. The reaction was inspired by\r\nNeo-Platonism, by the personal devotion of Julian to the classical\r\nfaith, and by the hope of securing a stronger imperial unity through the\r\nsupremacy of paganism. Julian did not openly persecute Christianity, but\r\ntreated it very much as Constantine did paganism. Had he lived longer,\r\nnevertheless, harsher measures might have been employed. He seemed to\r\nfeel that he was swimming against the tide, however, and fell in battle\r\nagainst the Persians (363) saying, \"Thou hast conquered,\r\nGalilean.\"[128:1]\r\n\r\nJulian's sudden death with one stroke precipitated the decline and fall\r\nof paganism. His successor, Jovian (363-364), a Christian, restored\r\nChristianity to imperial and popular favour.[128:2] The legal toleration\r\nof all religions continued under Valentinian I. (d. 375) and Valens (d.\r\n378). Emperor Gratian (375-383) began the repression of paganism in the\r\nWest, and Valentinian II. (383-392) continued it, while Theodosius I.\r\n(378-395) pursued the same policy in the East, and forcibly suppressed\r\npaganism.[128:3] The edict of 380 constituted Christianity the exclusive\r\nreligion of the whole Empire. \"We command all who read this law to\r\nembrace the name of Catholic Christians, deciding that all other idiots\r\nand madmen should bear the infamy attaching to their heretical opinions,\r\nand as they will first meet with the penalty of divine vengeance, so\r\nthey will afterwards receive that condemnation at our hands which the\r\nHeavenly Judge has empowered us to administer.\"[128:4] The new faith had\r\nwon a famous victory. Even the old Roman Senate, the last refuge of\r\npaganism, voted that the religion of Jesus was true.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nA.--PRIMARY:\r\n\r\n    I.--CHURCH FATHERS:\r\n\r\n     1.--Eusebius, <i>Life of Constantine</i>. <i>Nic. and Post-Nic.\r\n          Fathers_, i., 472.

II.--The Arian controversy. III.--The Council of Nicæa\r\n     and its actions. IV.--Later history of Arianism. V.--Sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly Christianity was characterised by a remarkable intellectual\r\nactivity, which was chiefly theological and philosophical. Speculative\r\ndiscussions were rife, particularly in the East, where the different\r\nphilosophical systems were prominent. Jesus left no definite creed,\r\nwhich all could understand alike.[131:1] The Ante-Nicene period was full\r\nof sharp and bitter theological and ecclesiastical antagonisms. Such an\r\nepoch of dissension and division the world was not to witness again\r\nuntil the dawn of the Protestant Revolt.\r\n\r\nChristian converts came from Judaism, and from various types of\r\npaganism, hence at the very outset there was a tendency to create two\r\ndistinct types of Christianity--the Jewish and the non-Jewish. This lack\r\nof unity and uniformity was clearly seen and sneered at by the pagan\r\nscholars.[131:2] This was Origen's significant explanation:\r\n\r\n     Seeing that Christianity appeared an object of veneration to\r\n     men, and not to the labouring and serving classes alone, but\r\n     also to many among the Greeks who were devoted to literary\r\n     pursuits, there necessarily originated sects, not at all as a\r\n     result of faction and strife, but through the earnest desire\r\n     of many literary men to enter more profoundly into the truths\r\n     of Christianity. The consequence was, that understanding\r\n     differently those things which were considered divine by all,\r\n     there arose sects, which received their names from men who\r\n     admired Christianity in its fundamental nature, but from a\r\n     variety of causes reached discordant views.\r\n\r\nAmong the heretical sects of the Ante-Nicene period were:\r\n\r\n1. The Ebionites,[132:1] who were Judaising Christians as shown in the\r\nbook of Acts and the Pauline Epistles. They desired to be both Jews and\r\nChristians, and ended by being neither. They soon divided up into many\r\nsects.[132:2] They lived in and about Palestine for the first three\r\ncenturies of the Christian era. They believed that God made the world\r\nand gave the Mosaic law, which was still essential to salvation; that\r\nJesus was the Messiah, though not divine, only a great man like Moses\r\nand David; but they denounced Paul and heroised James and Peter. They\r\nobserved the Jewish Sabbath, retained the rite of circumcision, and\r\nobserved the law. In the minds of the great body of orthodox Christians\r\nthey were regarded as heretics.\r\n\r\n2. The Gnostics[132:3] embraced various factions, mostly pagan converts\r\nto Christianity, which flourished in Syria, Asia Minor, and Egypt\r\nchiefly during the second century. Their ideas can be traced back to\r\nPhilo's Jewish-Alexandrian philosophy, to Buddhism and Zoroastrianism,\r\nand to the old Egyptian religion. Knowledge, above all else, was the one\r\nthing desired. Believing in the inherent evil of matter, they sought to\r\naccount for a bad world without compromising God. Jehovah of the Old\r\nTestament was rejected as the Supreme Being. They cast aside all the New\r\nTestament except the Pauline Epistles and parts of the Gospels. They\r\nprofessed to apprehend the divine mysteries. Some advocated asceticism,\r\nand others gave the utmost license to the flesh. All believed in the\r\nidea of the evolution of the world, through Christ, to an ideal state.\r\nAlthough denounced as heretics, they left a marked influence on\r\nChristianity. Gnosticism was so speculative, however, that it gave rise\r\nto many leaders and creeds.\r\n\r\n3. The Manichæans[133:1] accepted Gnosticism minus true Christianity and\r\nadopted Oriental dualism under Christian names. Manichæism originated\r\nwith Mani about 238 in Persia and spread westward over the Christian\r\nChurch. Its leading principle was absolute dualism--a kingdom of light\r\nand one of darkness in eternal opposition, yet brought together by a\r\nsort of pantheism. Christianity was accepted, but explained in terms of\r\nthis dualism. The Old Testament was wholly rejected as well as parts of\r\nthe New. The elevated priesthood celebrated the secret rites of baptism\r\nand communion with solemn pomp, lived as ascetics, possessed no\r\nproperty, and abstained from wine and animal food. This system, claiming\r\nto be true Christianity, had a marked influence on both the doctrines\r\nand organisation of the Church.[134:1]\r\n\r\n4. The Monarchians[134:2] denied the doctrine of the Trinity, but were\r\ndivided into a number of groups. The Alogoi in the second century\r\nrejected all of the Apostle John's works and denied the eternity of the\r\nLogos as a person of the Godhead. Theodatus, a leather dealer of\r\nByzantium, went to Rome in 190 and taught that Jesus was a \"mere man\"\r\ntill baptism gave him divine attributes. Paul of Samosata, Bishop of\r\nAntioch, was excommunicated in 269 for advocating the doctrine that the\r\nFather, Son, and Holy Spirit are one person, God. He maintained that\r\nJesus was a divinely begotten man exalted to divine dignity by the Holy\r\nSpirit or Logos--an attribute of God. Praxeas of Asia Minor visited Rome\r\nabout 195 and later preached in Carthage. He held that the Father and\r\nChrist were one and attributed the \"Passion\" to God, hence his party\r\nwere called the Patripassians. Sabellianism was simply another form of\r\nthis heresy and helped to precipitate the Arian controversy.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these four heretical sects there were three distinct\r\nreactionary and reforming parties:\r\n\r\n1. Montanism[135:1] originated, like so many radical movements, in Asia\r\nMinor (150?). Montanus professed to have received a message from the\r\n\"Paraclete\" to reform the growing worldliness and the lax ecclesiastical\r\ndiscipline of the Church. Montanists denounced the innovations\r\nintroduced into the Church, and sought to return to the simpler and\r\npurer doctrines and organisation of the early Church. They preached a\r\nuniversal priesthood of all believers. In exalting virginity, widowhood,\r\nand martyrdom, in professing a contempt for the world with all its\r\nexcesses, and in insisting upon an arbitrary holiness, Montanism was a\r\nforce paving the way for ascetic Christianity. They accepted all the\r\nfundamental principles of the Church, but professed to receive special\r\ndivine revelations from the \"Paraclete,\" as the Holy Ghost was called.\r\nThey lived in constant expectation of the coming of the end of the\r\nworld. Tertullian was their greatest apologist. But both the Christian\r\nhierarchy and the imperial power were turned against these reforming\r\npuritans. Under Justinian Montanism disappeared (532).\r\n\r\n2. The Novatianists[135:2] withdrew from the Church protesting against\r\nthe readmission of those who through fear deserted the Church in the\r\nDecian persecution (249-251). They were strong in North Africa and Asia\r\nMinor, and continued until the sixth century, absorbing most of the\r\nMontanists. In doctrine and organisation they did not differ from the\r\nregular Church, but only on the question of discipline. They also laid\r\nunusual stress on the doctrine of baptismal regeneration. Their churches\r\nwere still found in the fifth century in Rome till closed by Innocent I.\r\n\r\n3. The Donatists[136:1] grew out of the Montanist opposition to laxity\r\nand innovation in the Church and Novatian strictness of discipline. The\r\nDonatists denounced the Christians who during the Diocletian persecution\r\ndelivered up the Scriptures, and tried to drive them out of the Church.\r\nThe party centred in Carthage and was led by Bishop Donatus. They\r\nbelieved in ecclesiastical purism, held the Church to be an exclusive\r\nsociety of saved sinners, emphasised inner holiness as a qualification\r\nof membership, asserted the necessity of baptismal regeneration and\r\ninfant baptism, said unholy priests could not administer the sacraments,\r\nadvocated rigid discipline, resisted the union of Church and state, and\r\nwere organised as a hierarchy. They were very active in the early\r\npart of the fourth century, and attempted to secure the support of\r\nConstantine. He decided against them and tried to quiet them. Emperor\r\nJulian favoured them, but Augustine sought their overthrow. Finally the\r\nVandals swept them away.\r\n\r\nThe Arian controversy was a natural product of the early differences\r\nabout the nature of the Godhead and was distinctly connected with the\r\nEbionites, Gnostics, Montanists, and Sabellians. In the Eastern\r\nspeculation about the mystery of the Holy Trinity, one faction of\r\ntheorists tended to \"refine the Deity into a mental conception\"; another\r\nto \"impersonate Him into a material being.\" Between these extremes arose\r\nthe discussion about \"the nature and relation between the Father, Son,\r\nand Holy Ghost.\"[137:1] Tertullian and Origen both attempted to solve\r\nthe problem. Dionysius of Alexandria (260), in a contest with the\r\nSabellians, is reported to have declared: \"The Son of God is a work and\r\na creature, not appertaining to Him by nature, but as regards His\r\nessence, as foreign to the Father as the husbandman to the vine . . .\r\nFor as a creature, he did not exist before he was produced.\"[137:2]\r\nDionysius of Rome, backed up by a synod, repudiated that proposition and\r\nclearly stated the orthodox Trinitarian view. Origen widened the breach\r\nby asserting the eternal divinity of Christ, but at the same time\r\nmaintaining also His subordination to the Father as a \"secondary God.\"\r\nThe conflicting schools of theology at Alexandria and Antioch were ready\r\nto take sides in the controversy, which reached a crisis at the end of\r\nthe third century, when all theological thought was focused on this one\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThe controversy broke out in Alexandria in 318.[137:3] Bishop Alexander\r\nin a public address insisted on the interpretation of the eternity of\r\nthe Son. Arius, a presbyter, charged the bishop with Sabellianism, which\r\nadvocated an undivided Godhead, and held that Christ was a creature of\r\nGod, hence not coexistent and eternal.[138:1] He and his followers held\r\nthat God alone was eternal; that He created the Son, or Logos, by His\r\n_fiat_, hence the Son is different in essence and finite; that the Son\r\nwas created before time was and in turn made the universe and rules it;\r\nthat the Son is Logos in soul, stands between God and man, and is to be\r\nworshipped as the most exalted of creatures, the creator and ruler of\r\nthe world, and the Redeemer of men. It was contended that all these\r\npropositions could be proved beyond dispute from the Bible.[138:2]\r\n\r\nAlexander, in a personal interview, sought to stop Arius,[138:3] who was\r\nan old priest in control of the most influential church in the city,--a\r\nproud, learned, ambitious, and fascinating man,[138:4] who, defeated in\r\nhis candidacy for the arch-episcopacy of Alexandria,[138:5] began to\r\nfoment social and religious circles by attacking Alexander. Failing to\r\nquiet him, Alexander called a synod to discuss the disputed points, but\r\nArius seemed to carry the day and continued his agitation. Then the\r\nbishop commanded Arius and his followers to renounce their\r\n\"impiety.\"[138:6] Refusing to obey, Arius was called before a local\r\ncouncil in 320 and there excommunicated.[138:7] But Arius now spread his\r\nviews all the more zealously by conversation, by letters, by sermons,\r\nand later, while an exile, in a poetic work called _The Banquet_. His\r\ndoctrines pleased the wide-spread rationalism, and hence became very\r\npopular. They were put into popular songs and sung everywhere, and\r\nbecame the chief topic of conversation in all social circles. Arius,\r\nhowever, was forced to flee[139:1] to Palestine and thence to Nicomedia,\r\nwhile Alexander drew up his encyclic to all Christian Bishops\r\n(323)[139:2] giving the history of the controversy and defending the\r\nTrinitarian position.\r\n\r\nThe eastern part of the Empire broke up into two powerful parties: the\r\nArians and the Trinitarians or Athanasians. \"In every city bishops were\r\nengaged in obstinate conflict with bishops and people rising against\r\npeople.\"[139:3] Theology became mere technology. Staunch partisans came\r\nforth as champions on both sides--Eusebius, the Church historian,\r\nEusebius, the Bishop of Nicomedia, Chrysostom, Theodore, and Ephraëm\r\nstood for Arianism; while Athanasius, Marcellus, Basil, Cyril, and Blind\r\nDidymus became Alexander's supporters. In a short time the whole Eastern\r\nChurch became a \"metaphysical battle-field.\" Finally both sides appealed\r\nto Constantine, who, viewing the contest as a war of words, wrote a\r\ncommon letter and sent it by his court-bishop to both leaders in which\r\nhe said that the quarrel was childish and unworthy such churchmen; that\r\nmoreover it was displeasing to him personally, hence they were asked to\r\nstop it.[139:4] When this imperial request failed, Constantine summoned\r\nthe Council of Nicæa to settle the dispute.[139:5]\r\n\r\nThe Council of Nicæa was summoned by the Emperor for the summer of 325.\r\nConstantine's purpose in convening it was to settle by compromise or\r\notherwise religious disputes which might easily become a political\r\ndanger to the Empire. It was the first universal council of Christendom.\r\nOf the two thousand persons in attendance more than three hundred were\r\nbishops.[140:1] All of the thirteen provinces in the Empire except\r\nBritain were represented.[140:2] All the West, however, sent but six\r\nrepresentatives--good proof that the Arian controversy was an Eastern\r\nquestion. The Bishop of Rome was too old to go so he sent two presbyters\r\nto represent him.[140:3] Even a few pagan philosophers were attracted to\r\nthe Council, and actually took part in the discussions.[140:4]\r\n\r\nIn organising the Council the bishops were seated according to\r\nrank.[140:5] Discussions occurred for some time before Constantine\r\narrived. Then the Emperor entered \"as a messenger from God, covered with\r\ngold and precious stones, a magnificent figure, tall and slender, and\r\nfull of grace and majesty.\" He opened the Council with these words:\r\n\"When I was told of the division amongst you, I was convinced that I\r\nought not to attend to any business before this; and it is from the\r\ndesire of being useful to you that I have convened you without delay;\r\nbut I shall not believe my end to be attained until I have united the\r\nminds of all, until I see that peace and that union reign amongst you\r\nwhich you are commissioned as the anointed of the Lord to preach to\r\nothers.\"[141:1] He took part in the deliberations also and acted as the\r\nreal head of the Council, though the Spanish Bishop Hosius probably\r\nserved as the spiritual president.[141:2] Only bishops or their\r\naccredited proxies had a vote.\r\n\r\nThree distinct parties immediately appeared in the Council: (1) The\r\nArians led by Arius. Twenty bishops with Eusebius of Nicomedia at their\r\nhead constituted the voting party. (2) The Semi-Arians were led by\r\nEusebius of Cæsarea, the Church historian. They had a majority and were\r\ninclined partly to the Arians and partly to the orthodox side. (3) The\r\nTrinitarians, or orthodox party, led by Alexander, Hosius, Macarius,\r\nMarcellus, and Athanasius. At the outset they were in the minority, but\r\nsoon came to control the Council.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the authentic minutes of the transactions are not now\r\nextant,[141:3] if indeed they ever existed. The Arians, it appears, came\r\nto the Council confident of victory because the Emperor's sister\r\nConstantia was an avowed Arian, and he himself was supposed to be a\r\nsympathiser, since so many scholars about him upheld the doctrine. But\r\nwhen Arius presented his creed signed by eighteen eminent names, it\r\ncreated an uproar, the creed was seized and torn to pieces, and its\r\ndoctrines repudiated. All the signers but Arius and two bishops then\r\nabandoned the project. Eusebius of Cæsarea came forward at this juncture\r\nwith an old Palestine creed as a compromise.[142:1] It acknowledged the\r\ndivine nature of Jesus. The Emperor favoured it, and the Arians were\r\nwilling to accept it, but Athanasius was suspicious and demanded so many\r\nchanges that when, after two months of solemn discussion, the amended\r\ncreed was passed,[142:2] Eusebius, the originator, hesitated to sign it.\r\nThis was a grand triumph for the orthodox party. The Emperor required\r\nall bishops to subscribe to it.[142:3] The Semi-Arians did so under\r\nprotest. Arius and two Egyptian bishops[142:4] refused and were banished\r\nto Illyria.[142:5] Arius was publicly excommunicated and his writings\r\nordered burned. The business of the Council concluded, Constantine\r\ndismissed it with a splendid feast which Eusebius likened to the kingdom\r\nof Heaven.[142:6]\r\n\r\nThe results of Nicæa were very significant:\r\n\r\n1. The Church was given its first written creed, the Nicene Creed--the\r\nbasis of all later creeds, Greek, Latin, and Evangelical.[142:7] This\r\nwas the first official definition of the Trinity and has continued to be\r\nthe orthodox interpretation. The Nicene Creed contains all the cardinal\r\nChristian doctrines. It was universally proclaimed as imperial law.\r\n\r\n2. Church canons were enacted--the West accepts twenty, the East\r\nmore--which constitute the basis for the canon law of the Middle\r\nAges.[143:1] These canons indicate the burning questions in the Church\r\nat that time.\r\n\r\n3. The method of calculating the date for Easter, which differed in\r\nEastern churches and Western churches, was determined.[143:2]\r\n\r\n4. This Council, guided, as was believed, by the Holy Ghost, acted as\r\nthe infallible, sovereign power of the Church and set precedents which\r\nlater conflicted with the supreme power claimed by the Pope.\r\n\r\n5. The development of the papal hierarchy was stimulated. The Bishop of\r\nRome was recognised as the only Patriarch in the West.[143:3] He was\r\nsoon forced to be the recognised champion of orthodoxy.\r\n\r\n6. The Council of Nicæa marks the beginning of the breach between the\r\nEast and the West which resulted in the first great schism in\r\nChristendom.\r\n\r\n7. The law of celibacy was almost imposed on the Church.[143:4]\r\n\r\n8. Interference in the most vital concerns of the Church was recognised\r\nas an imperial prerogative. The Emperor called the Council, presided\r\nover its proceedings, acted as mediator between contending factions,\r\nforced the Nicene Creed on the Church, fixed the day for celebrating\r\nEaster, and approved the first ecclesiastical canons.\r\n\r\n9. The various heresies and schisms of the time were condemned. This\r\naction threw into prominent relief throughout the Empire the powerful\r\nparty of orthodox Catholics, who henceforth were to control the\r\ndestinies of the Church in both its internal and external organisation\r\nand evolution.\r\n\r\nThe condemnation of Arianism was only a temporary victory. Soon\r\nConstantine himself was won over by the Arians, invited Arius to his\r\ncourt, and ordered Athanasius, who meanwhile had become Bishop of\r\nAlexandria (328), to reinstate Arius in his parish. Athanasius refused\r\nto do so, and was condemned and deposed by the councils of Tyre (334)\r\nand of Constantinople (335), and exiled by the Emperor to Treves in\r\nGaul. Arius died before he could be recalled (336). Constantine II.\r\nrestored Athanasius to his see (338), but his brother Constantius and\r\nhis Arian friends deposed him again (339). Athanasius then fled to Pope\r\nJulius at Rome (339), who laid his case before a Western council (341)\r\nwhich vindicated both his creed and his rights. This supreme appellate\r\npower assumed by the Bishop of Rome is significantly prophetic.\r\n\r\nTo heal the Arian conflict, which was again active--this time between\r\nthe East and the West,--the Council of Sardica was called in 343. The\r\nRoman party controlled it, reconfirmed the Nicene Creed, and adopted\r\ntwelve new canons. The Arians refused to take part and held a rump\r\ncouncil. The result was a wider separation of the East and the\r\nWest.[144:1] Under Constantius, however, the Arian party grew stronger,\r\nheld the three Arian councils of Sirmium (351), Arles (353), and Milan\r\n(355), forced their decrees upon the whole Church, exiled Hosius,\r\nHilary, and Lucifer, drove Athanasius, who had meanwhile once more\r\nreturned to his office (346), out of his see, and even deposed Pope\r\nLiberius[145:1] and elected an Arian Pope, Felix II., in his place. Thus\r\nthe Arian party seemed triumphant East and West.\r\n\r\nBut the Arians soon split into bitter factions and began to destroy\r\nthemselves. Under Emperor Julian they lost imperial favour and saw the\r\nNicene party tolerated. The orthodox faction was thus able to gradually\r\nre-win power in the West and South. Theodosius the Great (379-395)\r\nexternally completed the Nicene conquest of the whole Empire through an\r\nimperial edict (380) and by calling the second general Council of\r\nConstantinople (381), which ratified the Nicene Creed in a revised form\r\nand passed seven additional canons.[145:2] But Arianism lingered long\r\nwithin the Empire, especially among the Teutons, who were slow to accept\r\nthe Roman faith--the Vandals in 530, the Burgundians in 534, the Suevi\r\nin 560, the Goths in 587, and the Longobards in 600.[145:3] It also\r\nreappeared again and again in the later heresies on down to the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nA.--PRIMARY:\r\n\r\n    I.--CHURCH FATHERS:\r\n\r\n     1.--Eusebius, _Life of Constantine_. _Nic. and Post-Nic.\r\n          Fathers._ 2d ser., i., bk. 2, 3. _Church History._\r\n          _Ib._, i.\r\n\r\n     2.--Athanasius, _Works_. 2d ser., _ib._, iv. _Fath. of the\r\n          Holy Cath.

VI.--Sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo see how a handful of outlawed, persecuted Christians in Rome became\r\nthe omnipotent hierarchy of the Middle Ages is to comprehend the most\r\nmarvellous fact in European history. But when the conditions and forces,\r\nwhich produced this wonderful organisation, are clearly understood, the\r\nmiracle becomes a natural and an inevitable product.\r\n\r\nIn the first century of the Christian era Rome was the heart and\r\nmistress of the world.[148:1] The Apostle Paul gloried in having\r\nintroduced Christianity into the great metropolis.[148:2] The Roman\r\nEmpire had developed an imperial and provincial system of government\r\nwhich was to serve as the model for the organisation of the Christian\r\nChurch. This decaying Empire, after a futile contest with Christianity,\r\nwas to become its servant. The mighty Catholic Church was little more\r\nthan the Roman Empire baptised. Rome was transformed as well as\r\nconverted. The very capital of the old Empire became the capital of the\r\nChristian Empire. The office of Pontifex Maximus was continued in that\r\nof Pope. The deeply religious character of the Romans on the one hand,\r\nand the inadequate and degenerate religion which they held on the other,\r\nwere positive and negative forces enabling the Christian Church to make\r\nrapid conquests in territory and numbers. Even the Roman language has\r\nremained the official language of the Roman Catholic Church down through\r\nthe ages. Christianity could not grow up through Roman civilisation and\r\npaganism, however, without in turn being coloured and influenced by the\r\nrites, festivities, and ceremonies of old polytheism. Christianity not\r\nonly conquered Rome, but Rome conquered Christianity. It is not a matter\r\nof great surprise, therefore, to find that from the first to the fourth\r\ncentury the Church had undergone many changes. During the first half of\r\nthe third century the hierarchical scheme of Church government appeared\r\nto reach a very advanced stage of organisation. Cyprian gives us the\r\nboldest and broadest claim of the Bishop of Rome to the heirship of\r\nPeter. By the fourth century the hierarchical and monarchial principles\r\nwere fully developed, and the Papacy had begun its wonderful career.\r\n\r\nThe leading forces operating to develop the Roman hierarchy up to 313\r\nwill now be indicated.\r\n\r\n1. The fundamental factor which first attracts attention in the\r\nconsideration of this problem is the obvious advantage in location. In\r\nthe origin of the civilisation of Western Europe three cities have been\r\nconspicuous for their contributions--Jerusalem, Athens, and Rome.\r\nJerusalem, the sacred city, gave Christianity to the West and through\r\nthe West to the world. Athens, the city of culture, bequeathed\r\nphilosophy, art, ideals, and science to the Romans, and through them to\r\nthe Celts, Teutons, and all peoples. Rome, the city of power, overthrew\r\nJerusalem, took Athens captive, received the contributions of both as\r\nher right, and on the ruins of both built up her universal sovereignty.\r\nThe rise of Rome to world dominion is one of the deepest mysteries in\r\nhistory. Rome possessed the matchless capacity of appropriating\r\neverything on earth that would contribute to her greatness. When Jesus\r\nappeared to give the world Christianity, Rome was the centre of all\r\npower and influence.\r\n\r\nRome was in the highest degree adapted to spread civilisation abroad.\r\nFrom Rome influences could be sent out into the world which could not\r\npossibly have emanated from Jerusalem or Athens. In fact anything\r\nconnected with Rome assumed, in consequence, an importance by virtue of\r\nRome's greatness that no other part of the world could give.\r\nChristianity in its cosmopolitan character resembled Rome and was drawn\r\nthither irresistibly as the best centre for propagandism. Hence, from\r\nthe outset, the Roman Christian Church was a church of world-wide\r\nimportance and power, and her bishop the most influential. Out of the\r\nruins of political Rome, arose the great moral Empire in the \"giant\r\nform\" of the Roman Church. In the marvellous rise of the Roman Church is\r\nseen in strong relief the majestic office of the Bishop of Rome.[150:1]\r\n\r\n2. In addition to the favourable location and extraordinary opportunity\r\nthat site gave, the fact that the Church, planted in Rome and there\r\norganised by Peter and Paul, was thus established on a double apostolic\r\nfoundation gave to the Bishop of Rome a respected and commanding\r\nposition from the very outset.[151:1] No other church west of the\r\nAdriatic could claim such a distinguished origin. It was both easy and\r\nlogical, therefore, to make the Bishop of Rome not only a commanding\r\nleader in the universal Church, but more particularly the conspicuous\r\nhead of the Church of the West.[151:2]\r\n\r\n3. The theory about Peter's primacy,[151:3] asserted certainly as early\r\nas the second century and generally accepted in the third century, gave\r\nan indelible character to both the person and office of the Bishop of\r\nRome, and elevated him high above all other officers in the Church. The\r\nactual _belief_ in this theory, a fact which cannot be questioned, made\r\npossible the realisation of the papal hierarchy. It seems to be an\r\nactual fact, likewise, that before the end of the second century the\r\npontiffs of Rome had assumed a title implying a jurisdiction over the\r\nwhole Christian world as successors and representatives of Peter, the\r\nPrince of Apostles. Irenæus said: \"Because, therefore, of her apostolic\r\nfoundation, and the regular succession of bishops, through whom she hath\r\nhanded down that which she received from them [the Apostles], all\r\nchurches, that is, all the faithful around her and on all sides, must on\r\naccount of her more powerful pre-eminence resort to this church, in\r\nwhich the tradition, which is from the Apostles, is preserved.\"[151:4]\r\nTertullian, after he had joined the heretical Montanists, accused the\r\nBishop of Rome of assuming the titles of \"Pontifex Maximus\" and \"Bishop\r\nof Bishops.\"[152:1] He complains also that the \"Supreme Pontiff\" was in\r\nthe habit of quoting the decisions of his predecessors as conclusive on\r\nall disputed questions, and that he furthermore claimed that he himself\r\nsat in the chair of St. Peter. These charges show how early the Petrine\r\nclaims were made and recognised.[152:2]\r\n\r\n4. The missionary zeal of the Roman Church soon led to the formation of\r\na number of suburban branches and within a comparatively short period to\r\nthe spread of Christianity throughout Italy and to other sections of\r\nWestern Europe.[152:3] These local churches naturally looked to the head\r\nof the Church in the great capital for assistance and instruction, and\r\nwere willing to acknowledge his jurisdiction and pretensions. The\r\nepiscopal organisation of the Church in the West, which was probably\r\npresent from the beginning,[152:4] made the transition to the hierarchy\r\ncomparatively simple. At Rome the process may be more plainly traced\r\nthan in connection with any other church.\r\n\r\n5. The persecutions of the Christians[152:5] centred in Rome and,\r\nconsequently, made the Bishop of Rome a conspicuous leader, with social\r\nand political, as well as religious duties, whose office was frequently\r\nsanctified by martyrdom. The persecutions helped to emphasise the\r\nnecessity of a better organisation on a monarchio-episcopal basis. That\r\norganisation became very exclusive,[153:1] and made a responsible head\r\nimperative. Who else but the Bishop of Rome could meet the demands? To\r\nhim was given, by general consent in the West, the headship of the\r\nChurch and he began to act as the conscious Pope of Christendom.\r\n\r\n6. The Bishop of Rome was the only official organ of communication\r\nbetween the East and West. He was the sole Patriarch of all the united\r\nWest, while the East had four Patriarchs,[153:2] and the sixth canon of\r\nthe Council of Nicæa confirmed his jurisdiction as an \"ancient custom.\"\r\nFrom Clement (95), whose writings are the earliest of any Bishop of Rome\r\npreserved, onward, he speaks in an authoritative tone, not only to the\r\nchurches of Carthage, Italy, and Gaul, but also to Greece, Asia Minor,\r\nPalestine, and Alexandria. Notwithstanding the fact that Alexandria and\r\nAntioch also claimed Peter for their founder, yet not one of the four\r\npatriarchates attempted to contest Rome's claim to priority of\r\nrank.[153:3]\r\n\r\n7. The head of the Roman Church was the champion of orthodoxy and kept\r\nthe Western Church free from schism. The Church of Rome stood\r\nconsistently for purity in doctrine and steadfastly opposed that\r\nOriental mysticism which polluted the Eastern churches with a host of\r\nheretic and theosophic jugglers. Epiphanius gives a list of forty-three\r\ndistinct heresies in his day. It was no easy matter for the Church of\r\nRome to faithfully combat all these theological vagaries and point out\r\nthe straight but narrow way. As a reward of her fight for the simple\r\ngospel-truth the provincial churches bestowed upon her their affection,\r\nconfidence, and obedience. They frequently referred for their own\r\nguidance to her spiritual experience, in deference and respect they\r\nsought her counsels, they watched her course with anxiety and faithfully\r\nimitated it, and all these things gave her a singular spiritual\r\ninfluence and authority in this early period, which was not unlike the\r\npolitical power exercised by the city of Rome. Again and again the\r\nBishop of Rome was requested to pass judgment on the various heresies.\r\n\r\n8. After the apostolic days, the multitudes who embraced Christianity\r\nseemed in many instances to lack the original fervour and spirituality.\r\nHence to control the erring, to correct the heretical, to expel those\r\nwho brought disgrace to the society, and to protect the faithful, it\r\nbecame necessary to develop some more efficient form of\r\ngovernment.[154:1] The Roman model of imperial and local government\r\nnaturally suggested itself and was either consciously or unconsciously\r\nimitated. The gradual transformation of the Bishop of Rome into the Pope\r\nof Rome was the product.\r\n\r\n9. In the apostolic days the practice generally prevailed of referring\r\nall civil, as well as ecclesiastical, disputes between Christians to the\r\narbitrament of their superior ecclesiastical officials. St. Paul even\r\nwent so far as to forbid his converts to resort to the pagan\r\ntribunals.[154:2] This work devolved upon the bishop, as a matter of\r\ncourse, who acted, however, rather with paternal authority and through\r\nmoral influence, than in accordance with fixed Church law. Thus special\r\nduties were laid upon the Bishop of Rome because of his superior rank\r\nand extended jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nSo rapidly did his prerogatives develop that he was early recognised\r\nboth East and West as, practically, a court of appeal. About 95 A.D.,\r\nClement of Rome wrote letters of remonstrance and admonition to settle a\r\nwrangle in the church at Corinth, and so respected were these epistles\r\nthat for a century they were publicly read in the churches. About the\r\nyear 150 one Marcian was excommunicated by his bishop and appealed to\r\nRome for admission to communion. The petition was refused but it shows\r\nthe influence of the Bishop of Rome. Polycarp of Smyrna showed at least\r\na dutiful deference in going to Rome to lay before Bishop Anicetus (152)\r\nthe disputed paschal question. When the East and the West were divided,\r\nabout 190 A.D., upon the proper day for celebrating Easter, Bishop\r\nVictor of Rome assumed the authority to decide on the correct day and\r\ninsisted that all Christendom conform to his decision. The Eastern\r\nchurches refused to obey him, it is true, but the Council of Nicæa\r\nenforced universal conformity to the day chosen by Victor.[155:1] When\r\nFortunatus and Cyprian of Carthage quarrelled over the former's claim to\r\nthe title of bishop, Fortunatus appealed to the Bishop of Rome,\r\nCornelius, for official recognition. Cornelius assumed the right to\r\nremonstrate with Cyprian and to demand an explanation of his conduct.\r\nCyprian repudiated foreign jurisdiction in the domestic affairs of the\r\nAfrican Church, but at the same time recognised Rome as \"the chair of\r\nPeter--that principal Church whence the sacerdotal unity takes its\r\nrise.\"[156:1] In 252, two Spanish bishops, Basileides and Martialis,\r\nwere deposed for misconduct by a synod of their province. They appealed\r\nto Stephen, Bishop of Rome, who peremptorily ordered that both be\r\nreinstated.[156:2] The bishops of Gaul applied to Stephen for advice as\r\nto what to do with Marcian, the Bishop of Arles, who had embraced\r\nNovatianism.[156:3] In the West, it seems, therefore, that practically\r\nall disputes and misunderstandings were referred to the recognised head\r\nof the Church for advice and settlement. Again and again the Eastern\r\nPatriarchs appealed to the Patriarch of the West for support and his\r\nsupport was usually decisive. Likewise the various factions in the many\r\nEastern schisms strove for favourable decisions from the Roman Bishop.\r\nIn 260 Bishop Dionysius of Rome called the Patriarch of Alexandria to\r\naccount for false doctrines. Even a Roman Emperor, Aurelian (270),\r\ndeclared that no one, not appointed by the \"bishops of Italy and Rome,\"\r\nshould remain in the See of Antioch.[156:4] As a result of these\r\nappeals, the power and authority of the Roman Bishop were magnified so\r\nthat, gradually, he came to claim this exercise as his right, and, in\r\naddition, precedents were set which were to become ecclesiastical laws\r\nin the next period.[156:5]\r\n\r\n10. The idea of one Catholic Church seems to have resulted from the\r\nintense struggle against the various forms of heresy, which had divided\r\nthe early Christians into sects somewhat like the various Protestant\r\ndenominations of to-day. This conception of ecclesiastical unity and\r\nuniversality had two sides: doctrine and ceremony. To teach the true\r\ndoctrine and to perpetuate sacramental unity the priesthood was created.\r\nThe persecutions emphasised the fundamental doctrines which united all\r\nChristians and made them conscious of this unity of belief. In order to\r\nenforce this uniformity the Bishop of Rome exercised the power of\r\nexcommunication. Victor took it upon himself to excommunicate the Bishop\r\nof Ephesus and his fellow-officials for refusing to conform to the mode\r\nof celebrating Easter in the West (190). Irenæus emphasised the\r\nnecessity and value of a spiritual unity in the Church,[157:1] and to\r\n\"the very great, the very ancient, and universally known Church\" of Rome\r\nhe conceded the most accurate apostolic tradition.[157:2] He declared\r\nthat it was \"a matter of necessity that every church should agree with\r\nthis Church, on account of its pre-eminent authority.\"[157:3] Tertullian\r\nspoke of the Catholic Church as if its eternal unity were a common\r\nconcept.[157:4] It was left to Cyprian, however, to boldly hold up the\r\noccupant of the See of Rome as the representative of both the organised\r\nand the sacramental unity of the Church beyond which there could be no\r\nsalvation. In his book on the _Unity of the Church_, Cyprian asked:\r\n\r\n     He that abideth not in the unity of the church, doth he\r\n     believe that he holdeth to the faith? He that struggleth\r\n     against and resisteth this church, he that deserteth the Chair\r\n     of St. Peter, upon which the church is founded, can he have\r\n     any assurance that he is in the church? . . . Likewise . . .\r\n     Paul teacheth the sacrament of unity saying: \"There is one\r\n     body and one spirit and one hope of our calling; one Lord, one\r\n     faith, one baptism, one God.\" . . . The episcopate is indeed\r\n     one . . . the church also is one . . . there is also but one\r\n     head and one source. . . . Whoever is excluded from the church\r\n     . . . is severed from the promises of the church. . . . He is\r\n     a stranger, an outcast, and enemy. He cannot have God for his\r\n     father, who hath not the church for his mother. . . . He that\r\n     doth not hold this unity doth not hold the law of God . . . he\r\n     partaketh not of life or of salvation.[158:1]\r\n\r\nThe power of excommunication to preserve the doctrinal unity and purity\r\nof the Church implied some share in appointment and administration. From\r\nthe very beginning, no doubt, the Bishop of Rome had ordained all\r\nprovincial bishops, and few matters of great importance had been\r\ntransacted without his consent or approval.[158:2]\r\n\r\nThe same tendencies and influences that led to the evolution of the\r\nbishop in the early local churches for the sake of order and efficiency,\r\nproduced a centralisation of power in the universal Church. With the\r\ngrowth of the idea that the Church had an outward organisation developed\r\nthe conscious need of a supreme bishop who could rule the Church\r\nsomewhat as the Emperor ruled the state. That such a unifying authority\r\nwas generally understood to exist by the time of Cyprian seems very\r\nclear from contemporary testimony. But it took two hundred and fifty\r\nyears to develop that leadership. There were not wanting, either, on all\r\nsides evidences of earlier local independence. The rise of the Papacy\r\nwas the logical culmination of the episcopal system. It must be\r\nremembered that by the time of Bishop Cyprian the Church had undergone a\r\nseries of wonderful changes. The Church had spread outwardly until the\r\nwhole Empire was covered and included all ranks. The Church had come to\r\nbe naturalised in the Empire and was gradually compromising with\r\nconditions. Some conception of the part Christianity was to play in the\r\nworld began to dawn on men's minds. The ascendency of the See of St.\r\nPeter was regarded, therefore, quite generally as a necessity.\r\n\r\n11. The centralisation of wealth in Rome rendered the Church there the\r\nwealthiest in Christendom. These riches were lavishly used, during the\r\nfirst three hundred years, to aid the poorer communities.[159:1] Such\r\nfavours could not be solicited, or received, without an appreciable\r\nsacrifice of independence on the part of the recipients. Ignatius,\r\nconsidering the munificence of the Roman Church, and wishing to confer\r\nsome special distinction, calls her \"the fostering mistress of\r\ncharity.\"[159:2]\r\n\r\n12. From the time of Peter to Constantine the Great, thirty-two bishops\r\noccupied the chair of the Prince of Apostles. The number and character\r\nof the members of the Roman Church led to the selection of the ablest of\r\nthe Western Christians to occupy that important office. These successive\r\nbishops, from the weight of their personal influence, transmitted a\r\ngradually increasing power. The labours of a few of these remarkable\r\nmen who filled the Roman See, like Clement, Victor, Callistus, and\r\nStephen, helped powerfully to lay the foundations for the Papacy.\r\nClement's attitude was \"almost imperious.\" Victor in his presumption on\r\nthe Easter question, Zephyrinus on the assumption of his proud title of\r\nPontifex Maximus and Bishop of Bishops, Callistus concerning lapsed\r\nheretics, and Stephen on the baptism of heretics, were all guilty of\r\n\"hierarchical arrogance.\"[160:1] Cyprian (d. 258) looked upon Rome as\r\nthe _Cathedra Petri_ and the Roman Church as the head of the universal\r\nChurch.[160:2] Thus it may be accepted as an established fact that the\r\nBishop of Rome was generally accepted as Peter's successor, at least in\r\nthe West, when Emperor Constantine legalised the Christian religion and\r\nmade it free to complete its organisation and to carry on its\r\npropagandism openly. He also increased the wealth and power of the Roman\r\nSee and made its bishop the undisputed head of the Western Church. At\r\nthe same time, in removing his capital to Constantinople, Constantine\r\npermitted the Roman Bishop to assume imperial prerogatives and\r\nencouraged the completion of the Church organisation after the imperial\r\nmodel.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the Church in 313 with the Apostolic Church reveals the\r\nfact that many pronounced changes and developments had occurred. In\r\nextent the Roman Church had spread from the Eternal City over the entire\r\nItalian peninsula and then to Spain, France, England, Germany, and\r\nAfrica, and numbered perhaps 10,000,000 members. In organisation the\r\nChurch had changed from a democracy to an absolute monarchy, from many\r\nlocal centres of authority to one great world power based on an\r\nimperial hierarchy, from communism to paternalism, from decentralisation\r\nto centralisation, from apostolic simplicity to worldly grandeur, and\r\nfrom a spiritual organisation to one largely political. The spiritual\r\nshepherd of the flock at Rome had come to claim and to exercise superior\r\nprerogatives over Western Europe and to serve the Roman Emperor as\r\nvirtually his spiritual adviser. In wealth and culture, too, the Church\r\nhad become a powerful social, industrial, and educational factor.\r\n\r\nIn institutions, rites, and ceremonies, as well as in organisation, the\r\nChurch of the third and fourth centuries was very different from that of\r\nthe first. A pompous ritualism with suggestions of image worship had\r\nbeen introduced.[161:1] Great emphasis had come to be laid upon the\r\nsanctity and power of holy water,[161:2] sacred relics and places,\r\npilgrimages, and the use of the cross.[161:3] The development of new\r\nideas in reference to the merit of external works resulted in asceticism\r\nand a celibate priesthood, fanatical martyrdom, indiscriminate\r\nalmsgiving, and various patent methods for spiritual benefits. At the\r\nsame time the number of Church festivals had greatly increased and now\r\nincluded Easter, Pentecost, Epiphany, and various saints' days.[161:4]\r\n\r\nThese new ideas and practices naturally gave the priest the lofty\r\nposition of mediator between God and man. A differentiation in the\r\nministry gradually crept in as an outcome of the hierarchical spirit.\r\nThe Bishop of Rome was elevated above all bishops as God's chosen\r\nrepresentative on earth. The bishops were exalted above all the\r\npresbyters or priests. The priests in turn held a position far superior\r\nto the subordinate officials, who had now come to include sub-deacons,\r\nreaders, acolytes, precentors or cantors, janitors, exorcists,[162:1]\r\nand other officials of minor importance.[162:2] These under officers\r\nlikewise were cut off from the laity by a pronounced gulf.[162:3]\r\n\r\nTo conduct the general affairs of the Church, synods and councils of the\r\nclergy came into existence as early as the second century.[162:4] Roman\r\nor Greek assemblies may have suggested the form of the synod, though it\r\nis more probable that they sprang spontaneously out of the needs of the\r\nChurch. These meetings at first were irregular and very informal and\r\nresulted either in resolutions with no binding force on the dissentient\r\nminority, or in a letter. There were four classes of councils: (1.) The\r\nsynod of a single diocese which probably existed from the beginning.\r\n(2.) The provincial council of the bishops of several dioceses. This\r\ntype began early in the second century. (3.) General councils consisting\r\nof the bishops of several provinces. (4.) Universal councils\r\nrepresenting the whole Church. When Constantine gave Christianity legal\r\nrecognition, councils became more common for the purpose of formulating\r\ncommon rules and dogmas, as for instance Arles (314). After the Council\r\nof Nicæa in 325 the validity of earlier decisions was recognised and\r\ngiven the force of imperial law. Thus had the councils changed in a few\r\nyears from local to general, from recommending to sovereign\r\nbodies.[163:1]\r\n\r\nParalleling this remarkable evolution in the organisation of the Church\r\nwas a marked departure from the simplicity and purity of the early\r\nChristian life on the part of both clergy and laity. The \"Apostolical\r\nConstitutions,\" the \"Canons of the Holy Apostles,\" and the decrees of\r\nthe councils of Elvira (306), Arles (314), Neo-Cæsarea (314), and Nicæa\r\n(325) all reveal the worldliness of the clergy in the laws passed\r\nagainst their engaging in worldly pursuits, frequenting taverns and\r\ngambling houses, accepting usury, habits of vagrancy, taking bribes, and\r\nimmorality. Because the multitude of pagan converts were carrying their\r\nideas and practices into the Church, many corrective measures were\r\nenacted against this degeneration. The licentiousness of the clergy\r\nbecame a still more crying sin among the laity, for it was unreasonable\r\nto expect the rank and file to be better than their leaders.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[148:1] Acts xix., 21; xxiii., 11; xxv., 11; xxviii., 14 _ff._\r\n\r\n[148:2] Rom. i., 8.\r\n\r\n[150:1] Gregorovius, i., 5.\r\n\r\n[151:1] Greenwood, _Cathedra Petri_, i., 104, 107.\r\n\r\n[151:2] The East had four Patriarchs: Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria,\r\nand Constantinople.\r\n\r\n[151:3] See Chap.

In fact from the fourth century onward\r\nthe proofs that papal supremacy was both asserted and recognised are so\r\nnumerous that it is only necessary to select typical cases and\r\nillustrations. Certain formative influences and forces noticeable in the\r\nperiod prior to 313 were continued into the later epoch and will be\r\nconsidered in order here.\r\n\r\n1. The missionary zeal of the Roman Church accomplished wonders. By the\r\nfourth century Spain and Gaul had sufficient Christians to warrant the\r\ndivision of the territory into bishoprics. Some of the Gallic bishops\r\nwere imbued with a remarkably active spirit of propagandism, notably,\r\nSt. Hilary, Bishop of Poitiers (350-66), who fought the Arians\r\nincessantly; Honoratus, Bishop of Arles, who inspired others to labour;\r\nSt. Martin, Bishop of Tours, called the \"Apostle to the Gauls,\" and St.\r\nDenis, Bishop of Paris, who suffered martyrdom for the cause. Similar\r\nworkers were found in Spain. About the same time Celtic missionaries\r\nfrom the north were working southward to join the work spreading\r\nnorthward from Rome. Columba laboured among the Scots and Picts; Aidan,\r\nin Northumbria; Columbanus, with the Burgundians; Gallus, in\r\nSwitzerland; and Amania and Kilian in Thuringia. From Rome went forth\r\nthe famous missionary expedition to England under Augustine (596), which\r\nsucceeded in winning the Anglo-Saxons to a belief in the Roman faith and\r\nto a recognition of Roman authority.\r\n\r\nIn return a counter-wave of missionary activity spread from England back\r\nto the continent, led by Wilfrid in Friesland; Willibrord around\r\nUtrecht; the Ewald brothers among the Saxons; Swidbert on the Ems and\r\nYssel; Adelpert in Holland; and Boniface, the \"Apostle to the Germans,\"\r\namong various Teutonic tribes. This widespread missionary work resulted\r\nin eventually bringing all Western Europe under the subjection of the\r\nRoman Church. Thus new blood, a more primitive enthusiasm, and an\r\nintense devotion were called to her service, and all powerfully aided\r\nthe rise of the Papacy.\r\n\r\n2. The continued orthodoxy of the Western Church made it a pillar of\r\nstrength, and gave its head a commanding position in dealing with heresy\r\nand schism. To him, more than ever, did people East and West look for\r\nfinal decisions in disputed matters of doctrine,[165:1] and contested\r\ncases of jurisdiction, rank, territory, and authority. St. Jerome in\r\neloquent words besought the \"Sun of righteousness--in the West\" to teach\r\nhim the true doctrine because \"here in the East all is weed and\r\nwild-oats.\"[165:2]\r\n\r\n3. The claim of the Bishop of Rome to appellate jurisdiction, which had\r\nbeen exercised more or less from an early date, received a sweeping\r\nconfirmation and a new impetus in 347 through the Council of Sardica.\r\n\r\nIn 340, Athanasius, the Patriarch of Alexandria, the champion of\r\northodoxy, appealed to Julian I. from an unjust decision against him in\r\nthe episcopal courts of the East. Julian I. called a council, to which\r\nhe invited the Eastern bishops, who refused to attend, reversed the\r\ndecision,[166:1] and completely acquitted Athanasius. He wrote a strong\r\nletter of reproof to the Arians in which he asserts Rome's canonical\r\nsupremacy in initiating conciliar proceedings against ecclesiastical\r\noffenders.[166:2] The Council of Sardica confirmed the resolutions of\r\nthe Roman Synod.[166:3]\r\n\r\nIt was decreed that any bishop, who might feel himself aggrieved by an\r\nunfair trial, could have the judges write to the Bishop of Rome asking\r\nfor a new trial at which, if it seemed wise, priests representing the\r\nBishop of Rome could be present.[166:4] Meanwhile, pending the trial, no\r\nsuccessor to the office of the accused could be named. This action made\r\nthe Bishop of Rome referee to decide, however, not the case itself, but\r\nwhether there ought to be a new trial. The right was conferred \"in\r\nhonour of the memory\" of St. Peter and hence it was soon claimed as an\r\ninherent prerogative of the apostolical See of the West. Later on it was\r\npositively asserted that these canons gave an appeal to the Church of\r\nRome in all episcopal cases. Whatever the original intent may have been,\r\nthe fact remains that this new power was an important factor in the\r\nevolution of papal supremacy. The Pope was given a power previously\r\npossessed exclusively by the Emperor.[167:1] In 378, Emperor Gratian\r\nadded civic sanction to the judicial authority of the Bishop of Rome by\r\ncompelling accused bishops to go to Rome for trial.[167:2] Ultimate\r\nappellate jurisdiction was definitely assigned to the Pope by Emperor\r\nValentinian III. in 445, when, of his own motion, causes could be called\r\nto Rome for papal decision.[167:3] Emperor Gelasius (496) approved in\r\nvery positive terms the judicial supremacy of the Bishop of Rome.[167:4]\r\nAnd Gregory the Great (604) assumed it as an indisputable fact that\r\nevery bishop is subject to the See of Peter.[167:5]\r\n\r\nAfter this period cases were continually referred to Rome for\r\nadjustment. St. Basil, Archbishop of Cæsarea, appealed to Damasus I.,\r\nthe latter part of the fourth century, for protection. In 398 the\r\nEmperor ordered Flavian of Antioch to proceed to Rome for trial. He\r\nrefused to go, but compromised with the Pope. St. John Chrysostom, the\r\nPatriarch of Constantinople, and head of the whole Eastern Church, early\r\nin the fifth century, appealed to Innocent I. against the persecutions\r\nof Empress Eudoxia and for restoration to his see.[167:6] Apiarius, a\r\npriest of Africa, appealed to Pope Zosimus against the censure of his\r\nbishop in 416. The Pope vindicated the priest against his bishop, and\r\nordered the latter either to revoke the censure or to appear at Rome\r\nfor trial.[168:1] St. Augustine's letter to Pope Celestine in 424 shows\r\nthat it was a common thing to refer disputes to Rome for\r\nsettlement.[168:2] Both St. Cyril and the Nestorians appealed to Pope\r\nCelestus, who decided in favour of St. Cyril. Theodoret, the Church\r\nhistorian, when condemned by the Council of Ephesus in 449, appealed to\r\nLeo I., who asserted that he could hear appeals from any source as a\r\ncourt of first and last resort.[168:3] These appeals, and many other\r\nsimilar cases, which could be cited both East and West,[168:4] show the\r\ngrowing power of the Roman Pope, and enabled him to make real the theory\r\nof his supremacy. To enable the successor of St. Peter to adjudicate\r\ncases more easily, vicars were appointed in various parts of the papal\r\nempire to decide finally on all cases, not reserved by the Pope. This\r\narrangement greatly enlarged papal jurisdiction by encouraging and\r\nfacilitating appeals.\r\n\r\n4. The removal of the capital of the Empire from Rome to Constantinople\r\nin 330, left the Western Church, practically free from imperial power,\r\nto develop its own form of organisation. The Bishop of Rome, in the seat\r\nof the Cæsars, was now the greatest man in the West, and was soon forced\r\nto become the political as well as the spiritual head. To the Western\r\nworld Rome was still the political capital--hence the whole habit of\r\nmind, all ambition, pride, and sense of glory, and every social\r\nprejudice favoured the evolution of the great city into the\r\necclesiastical capital. Civil as well as religious disputes were\r\nreferred to the successor of Peter for settlement. Again and again,\r\nwhen barbarians attacked Rome, he was compelled to actually assume\r\nmilitary leadership. Eastern Emperors frequently recognised the high\r\nclaims of the Popes in order to gain their assistance. It is not\r\ndifficult to understand how, under these responsibilities, the primacy\r\nof the Bishop of Rome, established in the pre-Constantine period, was\r\nemphasised and magnified after 313. The importance of this fact must not\r\nbe overlooked. The organisation of the Church was thus put on the same\r\ndivine basis as the revelation of Christianity. This idea once accepted\r\nled inevitably to the mediæval Papacy. The priesthood came, in\r\nconsequence, to assume all the powers of the great Founder. The Mosaic\r\nforms, as well as the Roman Empire, suggested convenient models and\r\nauthoritative examples for the new structure. It is not difficult to\r\ndetect in the oligarchical Church polity of the fourth and fifth\r\ncenturies a yearning for unity. It was but natural, therefore, that Rome\r\nshould boldly take the remedy into her own hands and pose as the\r\nauthorised representative of the visible unity demanded by the Christian\r\nworld. The position Rome had already attained and the worthy part played\r\nin the organisation and spread of the gospel gave her a superior\r\nadvantage, and enabled, nay compelled, her bishop to become the one\r\nhigh-priest, the \"universal bishop.\"\r\n\r\n5. In the fourth and fifth centuries the Petrine theory was generally\r\naccepted by the Church Fathers East and West.[169:1] The theory had\r\nbecome a dogmatic principle of law founded upon historical facts.\r\nOptatus, the African Bishop of Mileve (c. 384), strongly asserted the\r\nvisible unity of the Church and the immovable _Cathedra Petri_, with\r\nthe Roman Bishop as Peter's successor.[170:1] Ambrose of Milan (d. 397)\r\ngave the Bishop of Rome the same position in the Church that the Emperor\r\nhad in the Empire,[170:2] and recognised him as the great champion of\r\northodoxy, but at the same time called Peter's primacy one of confession\r\nand faith, not of rank. He put Paul on an equality with Peter. Jerome\r\n(d. 419) recognised the Pope as the successor of Peter and said,\r\n\"Following none but Christ, I am associated in communion with . . . the\r\nchair of Peter. On that rock I know the Church to be built.\"[170:3]\r\nInnocent I. (414) made a magnificent defence of the theory. Augustine\r\n(d. 430), the greatest of the Latin Fathers, admitted the primacy of\r\nPeter and recognised the Roman Bishop as his successor.[170:4] In his\r\nremarkable book, the _City of God_, he did more than all the Fathers to\r\nidealise Rome as the Christian Zion. Maximus of Turin (d. 450) and\r\nOrosius (d. 5th century) bore similar testimony. The Greek Fathers\r\nuniformly spoke of Peter in lofty terms as the \"Prince of Apostles,\" the\r\n\"Tongue of the Apostles,\" the \"bearer of the keys,\" the \"keeper of the\r\nkingdom of Heaven,\" the \"Pillar,\" the \"Rock,\" _et cetera_, but they held\r\ngenerally that Peter's primacy was honorary, and that he transferred his\r\npower to both the Bishop of Antioch and the Bishop of Rome.[170:5] But\r\nthese modifications of the Petrine theory did not arrest the evolution\r\nof the papal power. The important historical fact to be taken into\r\naccount is, that the _belief_ in the supremacy of St. Peter's successor\r\nwas quite generally recognised and accepted.\r\n\r\n6. The growth of conciliar prerogatives tended to advance the\r\ndevelopment of papal authority. The Council of Nicæa (325) gave the\r\nWestern Church the Nicene Creed, practically made the Bishop of Rome its\r\ndefender, and recognised him as the sole Patriarch of the West with ten\r\nprovinces as his diocese.[171:1] The Council of Sardica (343), in\r\nreality only a local Western body, decreed that deposed bishops might\r\nappeal to the Bishop of Rome for a new trial, that vacant bishoprics\r\ncould not be filled till his decision was received, and that he could\r\ndelegate his power to a local synod. This gave him a kind of appellate\r\nand revisory jurisdiction in the case of deposed bishops even in the\r\nEast.[171:2] It is claimed that this was a new grant for a specific case\r\nand in deference to Pope Julian alone. This power was confirmed by\r\nEmperors Valentinian I. (364-375) and Gratian (375-383).[171:3] In this\r\nmanner the Roman Popes were furnished the opportunity to claim universal\r\njurisdiction. The Council of Aquileia (381) begged Emperor Gratian to\r\nprotect \"the Roman Church, the head of the whole Roman world and that\r\nsacred faith of the Apostles.\"[171:4] The African councils of Carthage\r\nand Mileve (416) sent their actions against Pelagius to Innocent I., for\r\nhis approval. The councils of Ephesus (431) and Chalcedon (451) gave\r\nthe Bishop of Rome a primacy in rank and honour, which he soon made a\r\nprimacy in power.[172:1] The latter body recognised the necessity of\r\nobtaining the Pope's confirmation to insure legality. Here again the\r\nBishop of Rome had usurped a prerogative claimed by Constantine and his\r\nsuccessors. Later the Popes called most of the councils, presided over\r\nthem in person or through legates, and confirmed their proceedings in\r\norder to give them legality.\r\n\r\n7. The power of excommunication, an authority inherent in all societies,\r\nwas early developed and exercised by the Roman Bishop. This right was\r\nclearly recognised in the New Testament.[172:2] The power of\r\nexcommunication was originally put into the hand of the local bishops.\r\nThey expanded the biblical precepts into a penal code, and assumed the\r\nright to act as judges and to pronounce censure or final\r\nexcommunication. The apostolic constitutions and canons reveal a direct\r\nsubstitution of the authority of the bishops for that of Christ in these\r\nparticulars. Excommunication, for the first three centuries of the\r\nChristian era, was looked upon as a remedial and corrective measure to\r\nprevent a breach of discipline, disobedience, and heresy. It is a\r\nsignificant fact, therefore, that the Roman bishops, by the third\r\ncentury, claimed the power to put out of communion, not only\r\nindividuals, but whole communities, who did not conform to Roman usages\r\nand beliefs, even though the sentence could not always be enforced.\r\nInnocent I., imbued by the lofty idea of the prerogatives of his office,\r\ndid not hesitate to pronounce sentence of excommunication against the\r\nheretics, Pelagius and his pupil Cœlestius.[173:1] Thus the right of\r\nuniversal censure grew and Rome came to have her own officers to execute\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\n8. From the fifth century onward the title of \"papa\" or \"pope\" was\r\nunvaryingly used by the bishops of Rome. This title is an abbreviation\r\nof the words \"pater patrum\"--father of fathers--and was at first given\r\nas a title of respect to ecclesiastics generally. In the Eastern\r\nchurches it has continued to the present day, and in the Roman Church\r\nthe general use of \"father\" may be regarded as the continuation of a\r\nvariation of the original word. The next step in the early Church was\r\nthe restriction of the term \"papa\" as a special title for bishops. By\r\nthe fourth century it had been gradually reserved for the metropolitans\r\nand patriarchs. After the fifth century it was claimed and borne as the\r\nbadge of the supreme rank of the successor of St. Peter among the\r\nchurches of Christendom. Not until 1073, however, did Gregory VII.\r\nformally prohibit the assumption of the title by other ecclesiastics.\r\nThis unique transfer of a distinction first from all to a few, and then\r\nfrom a few to one, indicates a concentration of rank, dignity, and power\r\nin the one thus distinguished. A term, originally one of filial respect\r\nand reverence, becomes one of authority. The name and the office react\r\non each other.\r\n\r\n9. The letters of the Roman bishops gradually came to be regarded in the\r\nWestern Church as apostolic ordinances, and laid the foundation for the\r\nvast ecclesiastical legal system.[173:2] Siricius (384-398) wrote the\r\nfirst decretal which had the force of law.[173:3] A typical\r\nillustration of the character and power of papal letters is seen in the\r\ncommanding communication of Pope Celestine sent in 428 to the bishops of\r\nVienne and Narbonne concerning ceremonial abuses in their provinces.\r\n\"Inasmuch,\" he wrote, \"as I am appointed by God to watch over the whole\r\nChurch, it is my duty everywhere to root out evil practices and to\r\nsubstitute good ones; for my pastoral superintendence is restrained by\r\nno bounds, but extends to all places where the name of Christ is known\r\nand adored.\"[174:1] The Gallic churches received this pronouncement\r\nwithout a whisper of disapproval. The Council of Chalcedon (451)\r\naccepted a letter from Leo I., settling a disputed point in\r\ntheology.[174:2] Gelasius I. (494) instructed Emperor Anastasius on the\r\nsuperiority of the spiritual over the temporal power.[174:3] The\r\ndecretals of Gregory the Great spoke with a bold, undisputed\r\nauthority.[174:4]\r\n\r\n10. The Edict of Milan in 313 did not make Christianity the state\r\nreligion, but merely put it on a legal equality with paganism. It was\r\nnot long, however, until this new status enabled Christianity to\r\noutstrip its old rival and actually become the constitutional faith.\r\nState patronage prepared the way for a conscious and natural adaptation\r\nand assimilation of forms of imperial polity. Accordingly the admonition\r\nof the early period assumed the tone of mandates; interferences, whether\r\nfor advice or arbitration, took the character of appeals, rescripts, and\r\nordinances; and the model of discipline and ritual for all churches\r\nemanated from Rome.\r\n\r\n11. Constantine, fully aware of the pre-eminence and power of the Roman\r\nChurch, took special pains to bestow upon it his imperial munificence.\r\nThe Bishop of Rome was transferred from a humble dwelling to a spacious\r\npalace, possibly to the Lateran, owned to this day by the Pope.\r\nConfiscated property was restored and money donated. Splendid churches\r\nwere erected.[175:1] With grateful hearts the Christians gladly accepted\r\nthe sovereignty of the Emperor. As Roman citizens there was no\r\nconception in their minds of the spiritual government of the Church\r\nindependent of the imperial power. When Constantine called councils like\r\nArles and Nicæa, heard appeals, made appointments, and legislated for\r\nthe Church it was all accepted as a matter of course. The Church of Rome\r\ngained obviously more than any other spiritual body-corporate of the\r\nChristian world. This advantage, coupled with the wide-reaching claims\r\nset forth for at least two centuries, carried her by a mighty leap far\r\nabove all other churches and made her head, in theory and fact, if not\r\nin name, the Pope. Thus all the contentions of the Petrine claim of\r\necclesiastical government fell into a natural harmony with the plans of\r\nthe Empire. The rise of provincial churches corresponded to the\r\nprovincial system of the Empire. The elevation of the Bishop of Rome to\r\na primacy over all churches created a counterpart to the Emperor. The\r\nunion of the Empire and Papacy was not only easy and natural--it was\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\n12. No sooner did the Church rise from persecution to a great world\r\npower than the necessity was felt everywhere of some central authority\r\nto preserve its unity. The divisions in the Arian controversy clearly\r\nrevealed that need. The Emperor, in a way, sought to meet the\r\nrequirement, but, when he failed, he called the Council of Nicæa to\r\nserve that end. A universal council might be of great service in a\r\ncrisis but it could not easily be in perpetual session. The Roman Church\r\nsaw its chance at this juncture and embraced every opportunity to pose\r\nas the supreme unifying power in Christendom. It was a long and not\r\nalways an easy struggle, but the effort was at length successful. It was\r\nnot long after the day of Constantine that it may be said that the\r\nChurch had gained control of the Empire. That conquest gave the Church\r\nan unprecedented pre-eminence. In this movement the Church of Rome\r\nplayed the leading role. The next great problem was to enable the Pope\r\nto get control of the Church and in this way wield absolute sway over\r\nthe Christianised Empire, or, to state it the other way, over the\r\nimperialised Church.\r\n\r\nNothing seems clearer, after taking into account all the factors, than\r\nthat the rise of papal power was a natural, logical, historical process\r\nwhich began with the planting of the Church in Rome. Numerous incidents\r\nmark the different stages of development to show that every new\r\nassumption of papal prerogative was disputed and contested. Indeed\r\nnothing more distinctly marks the growth of papal authority than the\r\nfact that these protests were so numerous and so widely scattered.\r\n\r\nIn the beginnings of ecclesiastical organisation bishops enjoyed and\r\nexercised an equality of power and rank. The persistence of this idea\r\nmay be seen long after the period of Constantine. But hierarchical\r\ntendencies began very early and are very conspicuous in connection with\r\nRome. In the opening decades of the history of the Church it was\r\ncustomary for Christians eminent in station or piety to address letters,\r\nadvisory or hortatory, to other churches on general points of creed or\r\ndiscipline, or on special local questions. Thus wrote Clement of Rome,\r\nPolycarp, Ignatius, and others. Not infrequently churches appealed to\r\nprominent bishops for assistance and advice. Often one bishop would\r\ncensure another for the manifestation of unwarranted assumptions. Thus\r\nIrenæus reprehended Victor for excommunicating the heretical bishops of\r\nAsia and did it as an equal.[177:1] Tertullian, after he joined the\r\nheretical Montanists, scornfully denies the powers claimed by the Bishop\r\nof Rome by asking, \"How comes it that you take to yourself the attribute\r\nof the Catholic Church?\" He answers by denying the whole Petrine\r\ntheory.[177:2] Hippolytus, Bishop of Pontus, in a controversy with\r\nCalixtus I., shows how the claim of the Bishop of Rome was denied in the\r\nbeginning of the third century.[177:3] Origen also repudiated the\r\nPetrine claims.[177:4] While the great Cyprian did so much to create the\r\nconcept of the one Catholic Church under the leadership of Rome, yet, at\r\nthe same time, he strongly asserted episcopal equality and\r\nindependence.[177:5]\r\n\r\nThis important historical fact must never be forgotten in considering\r\nthe rise of the Papacy, namely, that the change was not directly from\r\ndemocracy to monarchy, but from democracy indirectly through oligarchy\r\nto monarchy. In addition to the instances of episcopal equality and\r\nindependence already given, the Apostolic Canons in canon 35 ordered\r\neach province to determine for itself which one of its churches should\r\nhold the primacy. This idea persisted long after the time of Constantine\r\nand, indeed, the Council of Antioch in 341 repeats the rule as if\r\nrecognising a long established regulation. The Council of Nicæa in 325,\r\nwhile assigning the highest rank to the Apostolic Sees of Rome,\r\nAlexandria, and Antioch, at the same time reserved to every province the\r\nrights of its own church. In the second universal council held in 381 at\r\nConstantinople, when the great provinces of the Church were defined and\r\nthe honourable primacy of Rome clearly asserted, no interference was\r\nallowed with the autonomy of the provincial churches.\r\n\r\nIn the West, however, local autonomy and provincial primacy were not so\r\nmuch emphasised as in the East. Rome and St. Peter's successor residing\r\nthere early established a predominance over Spain, Gaul, and Britain. In\r\nAfrica, Carthage for the most part obeyed Rome, and in Italy, Ravenna\r\nand Milan occasionally showed stubborn resistance.\r\n\r\n13. The civil government naturally approved a system of Church polity\r\nwhich was in harmony with that of the state. It is no surprise,\r\ntherefore, that imperial edicts supported the lofty position of the\r\nBishop of Rome.[178:1] Did he not represent the Church of the great\r\nEmpire and the faith of the Emperor himself? Besides it was always\r\neasiest to deal with him as a representative of the entire Church. In\r\nfact there was a sentiment in the Church that it was much better to\r\ncarry on all business with imperial authorities through him. To this end\r\nthe Council of Sardica in 347 decreed that all prelates visiting Rome\r\nfor the purpose of obtaining civic favours should present their\r\npetitions through the Bishop of Rome.[179:1] Theodosius (380) commanded\r\nthat all subjects \"should hold that faith which the divine Peter, the\r\nApostle, delivered to the Roman Bishop.\"[179:2] Valentinian III. (445)\r\ncommanded all bishops to recognise the Bishop of Rome as their leader in\r\nboth judicial and administrative matters.[179:3] Later Emperors lavished\r\non the Roman Church wealth, immunities, and exemptions which greatly\r\nenhanced its power and magnified the importance of its head.[179:4]\r\n\r\nJustinian, in a decree of 532, declared that he had been very diligent\r\nin subjecting all the clergy of the East to the Roman See. He also\r\nexpressed a firm resolution never to allow any business affecting the\r\ngeneral welfare of the Church to be transacted, without notifying the\r\nhead of all the churches.[179:5] Such a positive and sweeping assertion\r\nby such a powerful ruler shows the height to which papal power had\r\nclimbed by the sixth century. Pope John II. was highly pleased with the\r\nuseful acknowledgment of Justinian, complimented him on his \"perfect\r\nacquaintance with ecclesiastical law and discipline,\" and added:\r\n\"preserving the reverence due the Roman See, you have subjected all\r\nthings unto her, and reduced all churches to that unity which dwelleth\r\nin her alone, to whom the Lord, through the Prince of the Apostles, did\r\ndelegate all power; . . . and that the Apostolic See is in verity the\r\nhead of all churches, both the rules of the fathers and the statutes of\r\nthe princes do manifestly declare, and the same is now witnessed by your\r\nimperial piety.\"[180:1]\r\n\r\nThe emancipation of the Church and the great inflow of wealth and pagan\r\nconverts wrought a woeful change in its character and habits. A heathen\r\nhistorian declared that candidates would stoop to any means to secure\r\nthe pontifical office because \"the successful candidate gains the\r\nopportunity of fattening upon the oblations of matrons; of being\r\nconveyed about in stall-carriages; of appearing in public in costly\r\ndresses; of giving banquets so profuse as to surpass even royal\r\nentertainments.\"[180:2] The Fathers of the Church like Hilary, Jerome,\r\nand Basil deplored the vices, thus rebuked, in terms of even greater\r\nseverity.\r\n\r\n14. The barbarian invasions on the whole strengthened both the spiritual\r\nand temporal supremacy of the Holy See. They gave the death blow to\r\npaganism in Rome.[180:3] Once converted to Roman Christianity, the\r\nGermans became the staunch supporters of the papal hierarchy and enabled\r\nthe Pope to enforce his prerogatives in the West.[180:4] Backed by these\r\nsturdy Teutons, the Pope became the most powerful individual in\r\nChristendom and soon declared his independence of the Byzantine court.\r\n\r\n15. Another factor of no small moment was the extraordinary ability of\r\nsome of the successors of St. Peter. Among them were men of commanding\r\nleadership, men of brains and faith, fearless administrators, aggressive\r\njudges, and men conscious of the tremendous part the Papacy was destined\r\nto play in the world's history. Conscious of their own power, and\r\nstanding on their lofty assumptions, they took advantage of every\r\ncondition and circumstance to increase their authority and prerogatives.\r\nThus the office of the Bishop of Rome continually grew in power and\r\njurisdiction. Julian I. (337-352), the supporter of Athanasius, held\r\nlofty ideas of his power as Pope[181:1] and gave his famous decision on\r\nthe eucharist in the Council of Sardica (343).[181:2] Damascus\r\n(366-384), staunch defender of orthodoxy and champion of celibacy,\r\ninsisted on the recognition of his jurisdiction over East Illyricum,\r\nand, as a warm friend of Jerome, established the authority of the\r\nVulgate.[181:3] Siricius (385-398) upheld the jurisdiction of the Holy\r\nSee and issued the first decretal now extant.[181:4] In legislating\r\nabout discipline and abuses in the Spanish Church his words were\r\nintended to convey universal authority on baptism, marriage, and\r\ncelibacy. Speaking in conscious virtue of the authority of the Apostolic\r\nSee he said: \"We bear the burdens of all that are heavy laden; nay,\r\nrather the blessed Apostle Peter bears them in us, who, as we trust, in\r\nall things protects and guards us, the heirs of his administration.\"\r\n\r\nInnocent I. (402-417) accepted, as a matter of unquestioned right, all\r\nthat had been claimed by his predecessors, and surpassed all of them by\r\nthe wide range of his pretensions. He sought to obliterate all\r\ndistinction between advice and command. He spoke in a dogmatic and\r\nimperative tone on all questions pertaining to doctrine, discipline, and\r\ngovernment in the Church of the West. \"It is notorious to all the\r\nworld,\" he said, \"that no one save St. Peter and his successors have\r\ninstituted bishops and founded churches in all the Gauls, in Spain,\r\nAfrica, Sicily, and the adjacent islands.\"[182:1] Nor did the West deny\r\nthe maternity of Rome. Consequently he asserted complete jurisdiction\r\nover Illyria, assumed that the African churches were dependent upon the\r\nSee of Rome, formulated fourteen rules for the Gallic bishops, settled\r\ncontroversies in Spain, and manifested a lofty attitude toward the\r\nchurches of the East. He played a prominent part in repelling the\r\nattacks of the barbarians on Rome.[182:2] He was the first to claim a\r\ngeneral prerogative, as \"the one single fountain-head which fertilises\r\nthe whole world by its manifold streamlets,\" to revise the judgment of\r\nprovincial synods[182:3] and thus to legislate by his own fiat for the\r\nwhole Church. As the great guardian of orthodoxy, he condemned Pelagius\r\nand excommunicated him. \"Unstained in life, able and resolute, with a\r\nfull appreciation of the dignity and prerogatives of his see, he lost no\r\nopportunity of asserting its claims; and under him the idea of universal\r\npapal supremacy, though as yet somewhat shadowy, appears already to be\r\ntaking form.\"\r\n\r\n\"The first Pope in the proper sense of the word\" was Leo I., called the\r\nGreat (440-461). \"In him the idea of the Papacy . . . became flesh and\r\nblood. He conceived it in great energy and clearness, and carried it out\r\nwith the Roman spirit of dominion so far as the circumstance of the time\r\nat all allowed.\"[182:4] Before his elevation to the Papacy in 440 very\r\nlittle is known about Leo. His place of birth, nationality, and early\r\neducation are all shrouded in obscurity. For ten years prior to his\r\nelection, Leo was perhaps the most prominent man in Rome and noted for\r\nhis learning and piety. While absent on a civil mission in Gaul, he was\r\nchosen Pope. At that time the Empire was in a very weak condition.\r\nWomen, surrounded by their court of eunuchs and parasites, ruled at\r\nConstantinople and Ravenna. Barbarians were pressing in from all sides.\r\nHeresies rent the East and ignorance was fast covering the West. Western\r\nChristendom must be consolidated and disciplined so that it could meet\r\nthe crudeness and heresy of the powerful invaders and overcome both. The\r\nSee of St. Peter must replace the tottering imperial power. The law of\r\nRome must once more be obeyed over the Empire, but this time as the\r\necclesiastical law. Leo was the only great man in Church or state, so\r\nthe burden was thrust upon his shoulders.\r\n\r\nLeo possessed those qualifications which made him the master spirit of\r\nhis age and the \"Founder of the mediæval Papacy.\" Lofty in his aims,\r\nsevere and pure in life, of indomitable courage and perseverance,\r\ninspired by a fanatical belief in the Petrine theory, uncompromisingly\r\northodox, the great first theologian in the Roman Chair, he made the\r\nfirst clear-cut exposition of the extreme limits and prerogatives of the\r\nmediæval Papacy.[183:1] He asserted and exercised the superabounding\r\npower of the Pope to regulate every department of Church government\r\nwithout any human limitations. Driven on by a dream of the universal\r\ndominion of Rome and Christianity, a great orator who swayed the Romans\r\nat will, he acted as a resolute Christian monarch conscious of his\r\ndivine mission. Possessed of a capacity for complex rule, an\r\nextraordinary organiser and administrator, he used all his ability to\r\nmake Christianity and the Papacy the one great world power. Twice he\r\nsaved Rome from the barbarians, once in 452 when Attila, King of the\r\nHuns, was persuaded to withdraw without attacking the city, and again in\r\n455 when the Vandal leader, Genseric, was induced to spare the capital\r\nfrom fire and murder. He drove heresy out of Italy and suppressed it in\r\nSpain. He forced the African Christians to submit to his authority\r\n(443), regained the papal power lost in East Illyria, compelled the\r\nGallic bishops to obey his mandates,[184:1] and even asserted his\r\nsupremacy over the Eastern Church. Through a legate he presided over the\r\nfourth ecumenical Council of Chalcedon, guided its theological\r\ndiscussions, and was \"the finisher of the true doctrine of the presence\r\nof Christ.\"\r\n\r\nPope Leo laid the greatest possible emphasis upon the fact that there is\r\none God, one Church, one universal bishop, one faith, and one\r\ninterpreter of that faith, and that the recognition of this basic fact\r\nalone could bring unity and efficiency to Christendom. He very wisely\r\ncultivated a close alliance with the state and secured from Valentinian\r\nIII. the promulgation of an imperial edict in 445, which raised him to\r\nthe exalted position of \"spiritual director and governor\" of the\r\nUniversal Church. Thus the Pope would issue his laws for the Church,\r\njust as the Emperor did for the Empire.\r\n\r\nAfter Leo the Great, who died in 461, no important Pope filled the Chair\r\nof St. Peter until the time of Gregory I., called the Great (590-604).\r\nIf Leo drew the outline of the mediæval Papacy, Gregory made it a living\r\npower. He issued the first declaration of independence and assumed\r\nactual jurisdiction over the whole Western Church. His high ideal was\r\ncompletely realised so that even Gibbon calls his pontificate the most\r\nedifying period of Church history.[185:1]\r\n\r\nGregory I. was born at Rome in 540 of a rich, pious, senatorial family.\r\nHis great-grandfather was Pope Felix II. (483-492). His father was a\r\nwealthy lawyer and senator. His mother and two aunts were canonised. He\r\nwas very well educated for that period as a \"saint among the saints\" as\r\nJohn the Deacon, his biographer, declared. In grammar, rhetoric, and\r\nlogic he was second to none in Rome.[185:2] He studied law preparatory\r\nto public life and was well versed in the inspiring history of Rome and\r\nin current events. At thirty he was a distinguished senator and three\r\nyears later Emperor Justin II. made him Prætor of Rome.\r\n\r\nFrom his mother Gregory inherited a profound religious temperament,\r\nhence he naturally became imbued with the ascetic religious ideas of the\r\nage. The monastic crusade of the West, now at its height, found him a\r\nwilling convert. Upon his father's death, Gregory used his vast wealth\r\nfor charity and for founding seven monasteries. Persuaded by his pious\r\nmother, he himself became a monk in 575. Selling all his costly\r\nfurniture, fine clothes, and jewels for the poor, he turned his own\r\nhouse into a monastery and almost killed himself by his vigorous fasts\r\nand ascetic vigils. Soon he gained great fame as a monk, was chosen\r\nabbot, founded six monasteries in Sicily and enforced a tyrannical\r\ndiscipline.[186:1]\r\n\r\nGregory was a man of too great ability, however, to be penned up in a\r\nmonastery; consequently Pope Benedict called him to his court as one of\r\nthe seven deacons of Rome. In 579 he was sent, as a papal nuncio, to\r\nConstantinople to reconcile the Emperor and the Pope and to unite the\r\nEastern and Western churches, while at the same time he was instructed\r\nto solicit military aid against the troublesome Lombards. For six years\r\nhe remained at Constantinople on this mission and gained much fame as a\r\ntheologian and diplomat. Although he failed to reunite the two branches\r\nof the Christian Church, he did bring about an amicable understanding\r\nbetween the Pope and the Emperor and got some help against the Lombards.\r\nIn a discussion with the Patriarch of Constantinople over the nature of\r\nthe body after resurrection, Gregory won a signal victory. During his\r\nstay in the East he wrote his renowned work _Magna Moralia_. In 585 he\r\nreturned to Rome, resumed his duties as abbot, became a popular\r\npreacher, and was recognised generally as the most able man in the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nWhen Pope Pelagius II. died in 590, the western part of Europe was in a\r\nvery critical condition. The Teutonic barbarians had overrun the Empire\r\nfrom England around to Constantinople, destroying or burying nearly all\r\nthat was best in the civilisation of old Rome. Justinian, to be sure,\r\nhad recaptured Rome in 556, and it was to remain nominally under\r\nimperial rule until the time of Charles the Great (800), but the\r\nEmperor's hold on the West was limited and precarious. His\r\nrepresentative, the exarch, lived mostly at Ravenna. The Pope, however,\r\nacknowledged the sovereignty of the Emperor both in theory and practice.\r\nAs a result of the weakness and inactivity of the exarch, nearly all\r\nItaly lay prostrate before the fierce Lombards, and no efficient help\r\ncame from the East.\r\n\r\nThe city of Rome was in a miserable condition. The Tiber had overflowed\r\nits banks and had swept away the granaries of corn, thus entailing\r\nfamine and starvation. A dreadful pestilence had swept away thousands,\r\namong them the Pope himself. In a letter, Gregory compared the Roman See\r\nto an old shattered ship, letting in the waves on all sides, tossed by\r\ndaily storms, its planks rotten and gnawed by rats--almost a\r\nwreck![187:1] An imperial organisation was needed to give Latin-Teutonic\r\nEurope the highest type of an organised, Christian civilisation under\r\none law and one faith, and thus to preserve for future generations the\r\nbest that was in old Greece and Rome, as well as the best that was in\r\nthe Germans. \"It is impossible to conceive what had been the confusion,\r\nthe lawlessness, the chaotic state of the Middle Ages, without the\r\nmediæval Papacy.\"[188:1] A man of heart, power, and lofty purpose--a\r\nruler who saw the opportunity and need of the Christian Church in\r\nWestern Europe, who felt her new impulses, and who could guide her\r\nthrough a crucial period to a great and useful career--such a man the\r\nRoman senate, clergy, and people believed that they had found in the\r\nmonk Gregory. He alone could save them from Teutonic anarchy, on the one\r\nhand, and from Roman decay on the other.\r\n\r\nAlthough elected Pope unanimously by the senate, clergy, and people of\r\nRome, Gregory did not want the office. He felt unworthy of it and feared\r\nits duties might lure him to worldliness--hence he fled the city and\r\nwrote the Emperor beseeching him not to confirm the election. But the\r\nRoman prefect intercepted the letter and sent instead a petition urging\r\nthe confirmation. Gregory was captured at last and forcibly consecrated\r\nSupreme Pontiff. He was the best qualified man in all Christendom for\r\nthe place. He represented the best in Rome and the best in Christianity.\r\nHis comprehensive policy, his grasp of fundamental issues, his political\r\ntraining, his capacity for details, made him the man for the hour. He\r\nmerged the office of Roman Emperor and Christian bishop into essentially\r\none and thus became the real founder of the mediæval Papacy. His\r\npontificate, therefore, was an era in the history of the Church.\r\n\r\nGregory's policy was to uphold and extend the Petrine theory to the\r\nutmost, although personally refusing the title of \"Universal Bishop.\" He\r\ncensured the ambitious Patriarch of Constantinople for assuming that\r\ntitle and wrote to John of Syracuse: \"With regard to the church of\r\nConstantinople, who doubts that it is subject to the Apostolic See?\r\n. . . The Apostolic See is the head of all churches.\"[189:1] To the\r\nPatriarch of Alexandria he wrote: \"In the preface of the epistle . . .\r\nyou have thought fit to make use of a proud title, calling me Universal\r\nPope. But I beg your most sweet Holiness to do this no more.\"[189:2]\r\nAgain he exclaimed: \"Whoever calls himself Universal Bishop is\r\nAntichrist.\"[189:3] Gregory meant to exercise as much autonomy as\r\npossible in ruling the West but, at the same time, to submit to imperial\r\nauthority in all instances of conflicting claims.[189:4] He planned to\r\nunify and purify the Church and to extend Christianity over the known\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nUnder Gregory's able management papal power was consolidated and made\r\nsupreme in Western Europe. He systematised papal theology, and perfected\r\nand beautified the Church liturgy until it took three hours to celebrate\r\nthe mass.[189:5] He regulated the calendar of festivals. He checked\r\nheresies by driving Manichæism and Arianism out of Italy, Spain, and\r\nGaul, and even advised the persecution of African Donatists (591). The\r\nJews, however, were tolerated and efforts made to convert them. To get\r\nrid of simony he personally refused all presents and abolished all fees\r\nin his court. From priest to bishop he corrected the clergy and urged\r\nupon them celibacy.[190:1] He restored discipline throughout the Church\r\nand patronised all sorts of charity. He fought paganism fiercely by\r\ndenouncing the Roman classics and even boasting of his own ignorance of\r\nthem,[190:2] while at the same time he sent missionaries over most all\r\nof Western Europe. Monasticism, which he himself had adopted with all\r\nhis heart, he encouraged and improved by restoring the early rigid\r\ndiscipline; by separating monks and clergy; by restricting admission to\r\nreligious houses to persons above the age of eighteen years; by\r\ninsisting on a probation of two years; by condemning deserters to life\r\nimprisonment; and by favouring the Benedictine Rule as the model. The\r\npapal court was reorganised, and clergy were substituted for boys and\r\nsecular adults to attend the Pope. Even some efforts were made to check\r\nthe European slave-trade.\r\n\r\nIn administrative power Gregory was perhaps inferior to Leo I. The\r\nChurch was very wealthy, owning lands by this time all over Western\r\nEurope and in Africa. The Pope had to rule these vast estates as a\r\nmighty landlord. Subdeacons were his agents. Tenants were controlled\r\npolitically as well as religiously. The surplus income was given to the\r\nclergy, papal domestics, monasteries, churches, cemeteries, almshouses,\r\nand hospitals. On the first of every month he distributed to the poor\r\ncorn, wine, cheese, vegetables, oil, fish, meat, clothes, and money. The\r\ncountry was full of tramps and poor clergy; these he provided for and\r\nalso supported impoverished nobles.[190:3] His letters are full of\r\nitems about law-suits, disputes over weights and measures, collection of\r\nrents, emancipation of slaves, marriage of tenants, produce accounts,\r\nand a multitude of other affairs.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these multitudinous duties, he was virtual King of Italy.\r\nHe denounced the corrupt exarch and drilled the Romans for military\r\ndefence, though he always laboured for peace. He held the haughty\r\nLombards in check and converted them to Christianity. He extended his\r\nauthority over Africa, Spain, Gaul, England, and Ireland and even\r\nclaimed jurisdiction over the East. He was the first Pope to become in\r\nact and in influence, if not in name, the temporal sovereign of the\r\nWest. He paved the way for Hildebrand and Innocent III.\r\n\r\nIn culture Gregory was a true son of an age of credulity and\r\nsuperstition. He believed all the current tales about ghosts, miracles,\r\nand supernatural manifestations. The linen of St. Paul and his\r\nbondage-chains, he declared genuine and possessed of miracle-working\r\npower.[191:1] To the converted Visigothic King in Spain he sent a key\r\nmade from Peter's chain, a piece of the true cross, and some hairs from\r\nthe head of John the Baptist. Indeed this was a practice which he\r\nfollowed in the case of many of his friends whom he desired to\r\nespecially favour.[191:2] The \"monuments of classic genius\" he despised,\r\nasserting that it was his wish to be unknown in this world and glorified\r\nin the next. He very severely censured the profane learning of a bishop\r\nwho taught grammar, studied the Latin poets, and pronounced Jupiter and\r\nChrist in the same breath. It was his constant habit, on the other\r\nhand, to enforce upon all Christians--clergy and laity alike--the great\r\nduty of reading the Bible. Still his own literary work was rather\r\nvoluminous. He wrote 850 letters--more than all his 69 predecessors\r\ntogether--on all topics and to all Christendom. In addition he produced\r\nhis _Magna Moralia_,[192:1] some homilies, a book on pastoral rule, and\r\nliturgical treatises. His productions are below mediocrity and he cannot\r\ncompare with Leo I. as a critic, expositor, or original thinker. He had\r\nbut a slight knowledge of Greek and knew no Hebrew, nor did he possess a\r\ndeep acquaintance with the Church Fathers. Yet for that age he was a\r\ncultured man and enjoyed a high reputation for piety and learning, and\r\nspoke to unborn generations.\r\n\r\n\"By his writings and the fame of his personal sanctity, by the\r\nconversion of England and the introduction of an impressive ritual,\r\nGregory the Great did more than any other Pontiff to advance Rome's\r\necclesiastical authority.\"[192:2] His virtues and faults, his simplicity\r\nand cunning, his pride and humility, his ignorance and his learning--all\r\nwere suited to the times and made him \"the greatest of all the early\r\nPopes.\"[192:3] He closes the period of the Church Fathers and opens the\r\nMiddle Ages. For 150 years there were no material acquisitions of\r\necclesiastical power, hence the history of the Papacy becomes very\r\nuninteresting and comparatively unimportant.[192:4]\r\n\r\nWhen Gregory the Great closed his remarkable career (604) the Papacy of\r\nthe Middle Ages had been born and in form resembled the Empire.[193:1]\r\nThe head of the Church was known as \"Pope.\" Because of his peculiar\r\npersonal holiness he could be judged by none,[193:2] though himself\r\njudge of all. The hierarchy of officers had been practically\r\ncompleted.[193:3] The laity was distinctly cut off from the clergy, and\r\ndeprived of powers exercised in the first and second centuries. The\r\nelection of the clergy had changed from a democratic to an aristocratic\r\nprocess. There was a marked evolution in rites and ceremonies. Art and\r\nmusic were now employed. The mass gradually became the powerful,\r\nmysterious centre of all worship, while public worship became imposing,\r\ndramatic, theatrical. Festivals were multiplied almost without number.\r\nThe worship of martyrs and saints[193:4] became so widespread and\r\npopular that a \"calendar of saints\" was formed. Pilgrimages grew to be\r\nvery numerous and the use of relics[193:5] developed such a craze that\r\nthe fathers, councils, Popes, and at last the Emperor himself sought to\r\ncheck it. Religious pageants were multiplied and the use of images and\r\npictures of saints were encouraged in the churches. The Virgin Mary was\r\nexalted to the eminence of divinity. In imitation of the court-calendar,\r\nloftier titles of spiritual dignity were adopted or invented for the\r\nhigher ecclesiastics. The dogma of the \"unity of outward representation\"\r\nhad acquired not merely a material and visible, but also a sacramental,\r\ncharacter. Thus the Church was the only channel of spiritual graces,\r\nhence union with the Church was absolutely indispensable to salvation.\r\nThe Church had become immensely wealthy in lands, buildings, and\r\nfurniture. This corrupting familiarity with secular affairs was early\r\nseen and denounced. St. Chrysostom sharply rebuked the bishops who \"had\r\nfallen to the condition of land-stewards, hucksters, brokers, publicans,\r\nand pay-clerks.\" The Council of Chalcedon ordered the bishops to appoint\r\nland-stewards to look after their estates.[194:1]\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nA.--PRIMARY:\r\n\r\n   1.--_New Testament._\r\n\r\n   2.--_New Testament Apocrypha._\r\n\r\n   3.--Church Fathers.

IX.--Sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nMonasticism, the story of which is one of the strangest problems in\r\nChurch history and is enshrouded in legend, originated outside the\r\nChurch, but soon became the dominant factor in the Church. It was not\r\nthe product of Christianity so much as an inheritance--an adopted child.\r\nIt supported the orthodox faith,[198:1] upheld the papal theory,\r\nmonopolised ecclesiastical offices, helped to mould the Church\r\nconstitution, and supplied the great standing army of the Popes. It was\r\na determining factor in European civilisation. The monk was the ideal\r\nman of the Middle Ages. He stood for the highest morality and best\r\nculture of that period. As a missionary he planted the Church over\r\nWestern Europe. He stood between the laity and the hierarchy, as the\r\nfriend of the former and the champion of the latter. He created the\r\nsystem of public charity and had a marked influence on industry and\r\nagriculture. Before long a monk sat in the chair of St. Peter and\r\nsought to rule the Church. The first series of great ecclesiastical\r\nreforms was produced by the hermits in the fourth century, the\r\nBenedictines in the sixth, the Clugniacs in the eleventh, and the\r\nBegging Orders in the thirteenth. Monasticism, therefore, was a very\r\nimportant institution in the rise of the Church.\r\n\r\nMonasticism originated in antiquity and was based on a general principle\r\nbroader than any creed. It grew out of that mystical longing for an\r\nuninterrupted inner enjoyment of the soul--out of a passion for\r\nself-brooding, and out of an abnormal view of the seclusion necessary\r\nfor the cultivation of the true religious life, which would save the\r\nsoul from sin. It was simply an effort to explain the riddle of\r\nexistence and to comprehend the true relations of God, man, and the\r\nworld. Every great religion has expressed itself in some form of\r\nmonasticism. Centuries before Jesus there were monks and crowded\r\nconvents among the Hindoos. The sacred writings of the ancient Hindoos\r\n(2400 B.C.) reveal many legends about holy hermits, and give ascetic\r\nrules.[199:1] Buddha, who founded his faith possibly six centuries B.C.,\r\nenjoined celibacy on his priests.[199:2] Alexander the Great found\r\nmonasticism flourishing in the East. In Greece the \"Pagan Jesuits,\" the\r\nPythagoreans, were a kind of ascetic order.[199:3] Plato, with his\r\npowerful appeal for the ideal life, had a marked influence upon the\r\nascetic views of the early Christians, and Neo-Platonism became a\r\npositive force in Christendom during the third and fourth centuries.\r\nThe priestesses of Delphic Apollo, Achaian Juno, and Scythian Diana were\r\nvirgins.[200:1] In Judea the ancient Nazarites[200:2] afford an example.\r\nThe Essenes seem to be the direct forerunners of Christian\r\nmonasticism.[200:3] In addition there were conspicuous individual\r\nexamples in Jewish history like that of Elisha, Elijah, Samuel, and John\r\nthe Baptist.[200:4] In Rome the name of vestal virgin was a proverb. In\r\nEgypt, the priests of Serapis were ascetics,[200:5] the priestesses of\r\nCeres were separated from their husbands,[200:6] and the Therapeutæ were\r\nrigid monks who lived about the time of Jesus.[200:7]\r\n\r\nThese influences and examples, coupled with Platonic philosophy, and the\r\ninterpretation put upon the teachings and lives of Jesus and His\r\nApostles, produced Christian monasticism. Jesus Himself was unmarried,\r\npoor, and had not \"where to lay his head.\" He commanded the rich young\r\nman to sell his property for the poor,[200:8] and said: \"Take no thought\r\nfor the morrow what ye shall eat and what ye shall drink, or wherewithal\r\nye shall be clothed.\" St. John and probably other Apostles were\r\ncelibates.[200:9] The Apostles likewise taught that following Jesus\r\nmeant \"forsaking father, mother, brethren, wife, children, houses and\r\nlands.\"[201:1] They urged Christians to crucify the flesh, and\r\ndisparaged marriage,[201:2] and they too were poor and homeless like\r\ntheir Master.[201:3]\r\n\r\nThe supreme question asked by earnest Christians in all ages has been\r\nthis: \"What is the true, the ideal Christian life?\"[201:4] At every step\r\nof her progress the Church has given a different answer to the important\r\nquery. Yet in all this divergent opinion there is plainly seen one\r\ncommon conviction. To live in the service of God, in the religious\r\ndenunciation of the world, and in the abnegation of the joys of\r\nlife--that is the universal reply. In the early Church this position was\r\nvery strongly emphasised and led, in consequence, to the rise of\r\nmonasticism. Hence it may be said that the monastic ideals simply\r\nexpressed the highest ideals of the Church, and the history of\r\nmonasticism becomes a vital part of the history of the mediæval Church.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, too, that the old belief that the Church was\r\npoor, pure, and wholly spiritual until the time of Constantine is a\r\nfalse tradition. The secularisation and materialisation of the Church\r\nwas so noticeable as to cause complaint as early as the third century.\r\nThe Church Fathers unanimously deplore the precocious decay of the\r\nChristian world.[201:5] To the minds of many, therefore, the only way to\r\nescape the damning effects of contamination with the Roman world, the\r\nonly way to elude the evils in the Church itself, and the only sure way\r\nof leading the ideal Christian life was to flee from villages and cities\r\nto the mountains and deserts. \"They fled not only from the world, but\r\nfrom the world within the Church.\" When Christianity was drawn from the\r\ncatacombs to the court of the Cæsars, it lost its power to regenerate\r\nsouls. That memorable alliance hindered neither the ruin of the Empire,\r\nnor \"the servitude and mutilation of the Church.\"[202:1] Associated with\r\nthe power that so long sought to destroy her, the Church was brought\r\nface to face with the tremendous task of transforming and replacing the\r\nEmpire. At the same time the Church made a desperate attempt, though in\r\nvain, to keep alive the spiritual torches of apostolic Christianity. The\r\nsolution of that great problem, however, was left to the monks.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy which prevailed among many of the early Christians held\r\nthat the material world is all evil, and that the spiritual world is the\r\nonly good. Gnosticism, which permeated Christendom in the second\r\ncentury, declared that the body is the seat of evil and hence that it\r\nmust be abused in order to purify the soul within.[202:2] Montanism\r\nadvocated an excessive puritanism, and prescribed numerous fasts and\r\nseverities, which paved the way for asceticism. Other groups of\r\nChristian philosophers exercised similar influences.[202:3] The Church\r\nitself commended fasting and other practices for the cultivation of\r\nspiritual benefit. Celibacy of the clergy gradually became the rule. As\r\na result the belief soon developed that the surest way to gain eternal\r\njoys in heaven was to turn away from the transitory pleasures of earth.\r\nChristianity in the first and second centuries was the gospel of\r\nrenunciation and resurrection. The next logical step was to make the\r\nbody as miserable as possible here--sort of a pious sacrifice--in order\r\nto make the soul happier hereafter. To die that one might really live,\r\nto find one's life in losing it--that became the supreme purpose of\r\nearthly existence. The most eminent of the early Fathers commended\r\nasceticism, particularly fasting and celibacy, and many likewise\r\npractised it. It is easy to feel that the air was charged with ascetic\r\nideals. The literature, the philosophy, and the religion of the day all\r\npointed out narrow paths that led to holiness. As a result there were\r\nmany ascetics of both sexes, although they were bound by no irrevocable\r\nvow.[203:1]\r\n\r\nThe persecutions of Christians by the Roman government forced many to\r\nflee for safety to the deserts and mountains.[203:2] Thus Paul of Thebes\r\nand St. Anthony fled in the Decian persecutions about the year 250. When\r\npersecution ceased, martyrdom had become such a holy act, and such a\r\nshort, easy road to a sainted, eternal life, that the most devout\r\nresolved that since they could not die as martyrs, they would at least\r\nlive as martyrs. The mildness of the climate in Egypt and Palestine,\r\nwhere the small amount of food and clothing needed for subsistence was\r\neasily procured, made those regions the birthplace of monasticism. The\r\ngrowth of worldliness in the Church, with the increase of numbers and\r\nwealth, gave rise to many cries for reform. The legalisation and, along\r\nwith it, the paganisation of the Church gave birth to much that was\r\nbitterly denounced. The union of the Church and state was the\r\nclimax--the Church was no longer the \"bride of Christ,\" it was held, but\r\nthe mistress of a worldly ruler. Hence monasticism turned its back not\r\nonly on the world but also on the Church. To understand it, therefore,\r\nit must be viewed as the first great reformation in the Church--a desire\r\nto return to simple, pure, spiritual, apostolic Christianity.[204:1]\r\n\r\nChristian monasticism did not begin at any fixed time or place. It was\r\nslowly evolved as a curious mixture of heathen, Jewish, and Christian\r\ninfluences. The whole Church had an ascetic aspect during the apostolic\r\nage, hence endurance, hardihood, and constant self-denial were required\r\nof its members. But for one hundred and fifty years no proofs of a\r\ndistinct class of ascetics can be found within the Church, except,\r\nperhaps, the order of widows, devoted to charity, supported by gifts\r\nfrom the faithful, and sanctioned by the Apostles.[204:2] In the second\r\ncentury, however, a class of orthodox Christians, who desired to attain\r\nChristian perfection, were called \"abstinents\" or \"ascetics.\" They\r\nwithdrew from society but not from the Church, renounced marriage and\r\nproperty, fasted and prayed, and eagerly sought a martyr's death.[204:3]\r\nThe belief that the end of the world was near no doubt did much to\r\nemphasise the necessity of preparing for the day of judgment. By the\r\nthird century the Christian literature, philosophy, and theology were\r\ntinged with asceticism. Cyprian, Origen, Hieracus, Methodius,\r\nTertullian, and others taught the efficacy of asceticism in one form or\r\nanother and, to some extent, practised it themselves,[205:1] but always\r\nwithin the Church. The heretical sects became still more prominent in\r\ntheir reverence for austerities and even outdid the orthodox in\r\npractice.[205:2] This first stage of asceticism was neither organised,\r\nnor absolutely cut off from the Church.\r\n\r\nThe product of this wide-spread ascetic agitation was the creation of a\r\nnew type, namely, anchoretism, or hermit life, about the middle of the\r\nthird century. This was the second phase of monastic evolution. It\r\nappeared first in Egypt about the fourth century, where the physical\r\nconditions were most suitable, in the home of the Therapeutæ and\r\nSerapis monks, the stronghold of heresy and paganism, the birthplace\r\nof Neo-Platonism amid a people famous for fanaticism. The Decian\r\npersecution in 250 was, apparently, the immediate occasion for\r\nits birth. Anthony of Alexandria, and Ammon were the earliest\r\nrepresentatives of this new form of asceticism. Paul of Thebes, however,\r\nis now generally believed to be a pious romance from the pen of Jerome,\r\nbut he may still be viewed as typical.\r\n\r\nAnthony (251-356), the \"patriarch of the monks,\" was the real founder of\r\nanchoretism. He early sold his estate for the poor, gave his sister to a\r\nbody of virgins, and cut himself off from the world by retiring to a\r\ndesert in order to devote his life to spiritual things. He lived as a\r\nstrict hermit till a great age, gained a world-wide fame, had many\r\nvisitors seeking spiritual guidance, and won many converts to\r\nmonasticism. Soon the wildest tales were told about his divine powers.\r\nBefore he died Egypt was full of hermits, and some were found in\r\nPalestine. Athanasius wrote his biography, which was read over all\r\nChristendom and scattered seeds of anchoretism everywhere--a book which\r\ninfluenced the thought of the age. Ammon had a settlement of possibly\r\n5000 hermits at Mount Nitria in Lower Egypt and was almost as renowned\r\nas Anthony, his great contemporary.[206:1]\r\n\r\nThe example of these illustrious characters drew thousands of both the\r\ncurious and the sincere to Egypt.[206:2] Whole congregations, led by\r\ntheir bishops, withdrew to the desert for salvation.[206:3] Priests fled\r\nfrom the obligations of their office.[206:4] By the fourth century that\r\nland was full of hermits. Their life was of a negative character,\r\nfounded on abstinence and bodily abuse--a holy rivalry of self-torture\r\nand suicidal austerities. These practices may be divided into four\r\nclasses: dietetic, sexual, social, and spiritual.\r\n\r\n(1) From a dietetic standpoint the hermits either fasted, or ate the\r\nsimplest foods, or consumed the smallest quantities. Thus the renowned\r\nIsidore of Alexandria never ate meat, and often at the table would burst\r\ninto tears for shame at the thought that he who was destined to eat\r\nangel's food in Paradise should have to eat the material food of\r\nanimals. Macarius ate but once a week. His son lived three years on five\r\nounces of bread a day and seven years on raw vegetables. Alos boasted\r\nthat up to his eighteenth year he never ate bread. Symeon ate but once\r\ndaily and in fast time not at all. Heliodorus often fasted seven days at\r\na time. In Mesopotamia a group of hermits lived on grass.[207:1]\r\n\r\n(2) Sexually the hermits believed either in absolute virginity or in\r\nabstinence.\r\n\r\n(3) The social and domestic vagaries of anchoretism assumed many forms.\r\nThe hermits fled from the society of the world; deserted friends and\r\nfamily; courted the company of wild beasts[207:2]; lived in caves,\r\ndried-up wells, swamps, rude huts, tombs, and on the summits of solitary\r\ncolumns, or wandered about without fixed homes.[207:3] A monk named\r\nAkepsismas lived sixty years in the same cell without seeing or speaking\r\nto any person and was finally shot for a wolf. Some hermits wore no\r\nclothing,[207:4] and thus exposed the body to the broiling sun and to\r\nbiting insects. Macarius, to atone for killing a gnat, lay naked six\r\nmonths in a swamp and was so badly stung that he was mistaken for a\r\nleper.[207:5] Others wore hair shirts, carried heavy weights suspended\r\nfrom the body, slept in thorn bushes, against a pillar, in cramped\r\nquarters, or deprived themselves altogether of sleep. Many never washed\r\ntheir faces nor cared for their hair, beards, teeth, and nails. With\r\nthem filthiness seemed to be next to godliness. Anthony and Hilarion\r\nscorned either to cut or to comb their hair except at Easter, or to wash\r\ntheir hands and faces. St. Abraham never washed his face for fifty\r\nyears--yet his biographer proudly says, \"His face reflected the purity\r\nof his soul.\" Theodosius like a second Moses, had a stream of water\r\nburst from a rock that his thirsty monks might drink. One wicked fellow,\r\novercome by a pitiable weakness for cleanliness, took a bath, when, lo!\r\nthe stream dried up. Thereupon the frightened and repentant monks\r\npromised never to insult heaven by using water for that purpose again,\r\nand after a year of waiting a second miracle gave them a fresh supply.\r\n\r\n(4) A sincere desire for spiritual improvement expressed itself in\r\nvarious practices. Prayer was perhaps the most common means to that end,\r\nand it was believed that number and duration counted the most. Paul the\r\nSimple repeated three hundred prayers a day and counted them with\r\npebbles. A certain famous virgin added four hundred to that number\r\ndaily. Some spent all day and others all night in prayer. Meditation and\r\ncontemplation were generally employed. Preaching and singing were common\r\nforms of religious activity. Studying and writing engaged those of a\r\nmore scholarly bent of mind.\r\n\r\nOut of this unorganised anchoretism there grew, by the latter part of\r\nthe third century, a crude form of group monasticism. This was the third\r\nstage in the progress of monastic life. Such renowned hermits as St.\r\nAnthony in Upper Egypt, Ammon at Mount Nitria, Joannes in Thebaid,\r\nMacarius in the Scetische Desert, and Hilarion in the Gaza Desert each\r\nhad a coterie of imitators imbued with a common purpose and with a\r\nprofound respect for their leader; but no uniform rules governed them\r\nat first. As time passed, however, the necessity of regulating the\r\nvarious relations of so many became apparent.[209:1] The organisations\r\nof the Essenes and Therapeutæ may have served as models. At Mount Nitria\r\nthe monks by common arrangement lived in separate cells, but had a\r\ndining room and a chapel for all.[209:2] Pachomius (282-346), a\r\nconverted heathen soldier, of little education, a pupil of Palæmon for\r\ntwelve years, created the first monastic rule and organised at Tabenna\r\non the Nile the first monastic congregation (322), while his sister\r\nformed the first convent at Tabenisi. This first walled monastery had\r\nmany cells built to accommodate three monks in each. Membership was\r\nguarded by three years' probation on severe discipline. The monks met in\r\nsilence for one daily meal and wore white hoods so as not to see each\r\nother. They prayed thirty-six times daily, worked with their hands\r\nindoors and out, and wore over their linen underclothes white goat skins\r\nday and night. They were ruled by \"priors\" chosen on merit from the\r\ntwenty-four classes of monks.[209:3] At the head of the whole system\r\nstood an abbot.[209:4] When Pachomius died (346) he had established nine\r\ncloisters with 3000 monks. He called them all together twice a year, and\r\npaid them annual visits. By 400 the monks numbered 50,000.[209:5] The\r\ngreat Athanasius visited Tabenna to inspect the system and to study the\r\noperation of this epoch-making rule.\r\n\r\nFrom Tabenna organised monasticism spread over Egypt and then to nearly\r\nevery province in the Roman Empire by the end of the fourth\r\ncentury.[210:1] In the Holy Land laboured Hilarion,[210:2]\r\nEpiphanius,[210:3] Hesycas,[210:4] the Bethlehem brothers,[210:5]\r\nAmmonius,[210:6] Silvanus, and Zacharias. Jerome, the celebrated Church\r\nFather, with Paula, a rich Roman widow, left Rome for the East. After\r\nstudying monasticism in Egypt they located at Bethlehem (386). There\r\nJerome studied the Scriptures and ruled a large crowd of monks, while\r\nPaula became the head of a convent for girls. Melania built a convent on\r\nthe Mount of Olives and ruled fifty virgins (375). Goddana and Elias\r\nlaboured on the lower Jordan.\r\n\r\nIn Asia Minor laboured, conspicuous among many, Eustathius who first\r\nprescribed a monastic dress, Basil the Great (c. 379) who originated the\r\nmonastic vow,[210:7] the famous Nilus (c. 430), and the hated hermit\r\nMarcus (c. 431). Syria was renowned for at least a dozen hermits, the\r\nmost celebrated being Simeon Stylites (c. 459),[210:8] the pillar saint.\r\nFrom Egypt and Asia the institution spread to Greece and became quite\r\ngeneral by the fourth century. The most famous cloister was that of\r\nStudium (460) at Constantinople. The islands of the Adriatic and Tuscan\r\nSea were soon covered with monasteries swarming with monks.[210:9]\r\n\r\nThe fourth and most important step is found in the development of the\r\ninstitution in western Europe.\r\n\r\nAthanasius, a hero and oracle to the Western Church, on a tour to Rome\r\nin 340, carried with him from Egypt two specimens of hermits.[211:1] His\r\n_Life of Anthony_ was soon translated into Latin. The West had already\r\nheard about the institution, and many individuals had visited the most\r\ncelebrated hermits in Egypt. After 340 many men and women began to give\r\nenthusiastic support to the new institution. Eusebius (c. 370) lived by\r\nrule with his clergy under one roof at Vercelli in northern\r\nItaly.[211:2] Ambrose fostered it in and around Milan.[211:3] Paul of\r\nNola (c. 431) lived in Campagna. Conspicuous examples were found among\r\nthe Roman virgins and widows.[211:4] Marcella in Rome turned her palace\r\ninto a convent.[211:5] Paula and her whole family lived as ascetics. The\r\nwidow Lea was an active worker.[211:6] Melania devoted her fortune to\r\nthe cause. Many of the nobles of Rome likewise became converts to the\r\nnew idea.[211:7] Jerome and Rufinus were conspicuous examples of those\r\ndevotees who by precept and practice soon popularised monasticism\r\nthroughout Italy. Convents for both sexes were soon founded.[211:8] From\r\nRome Augustine carried the institution back to north-western Africa.\r\nWhen Cassian (c. 448) left Egypt and planted two monasteries at\r\nMarseilles, he found monks already in France. Martin, the Bishop of\r\nTours, turned his episcopal palace into a monastery, and at his death\r\n(400) 2000 monks followed him to the grave.[212:1] Poitiers, Lyons, and\r\nTreves, together with the bordering mountains, were soon scenes of\r\nmonastic activity. Donatus, an African monk, early carried the new faith\r\nto Spain where it soon became so popular that by 380 a synod forbade\r\npriests dressing as monks. Athanasius, who lived at Treves as an exile,\r\nprobably introduced it into Germany. The British Isles had a flourishing\r\nsystem long before the mission of Augustine. By the fifth century,\r\ntherefore, monasticism had been firmly planted over all western\r\nEurope.[212:2]\r\n\r\nAlthough western monasticism was an offspring of the eastern type, yet\r\nthe child differed much from the parent. Anchoretism gained but little\r\nfoothold in the West because of climatic and ethnic differences. The\r\ngroup type was dominant in the West, and extremes and excesses were\r\nabsent. No pillar saints and other conspicuous fanatics were found\r\nthere.[212:3] Western monasticism was a more practical system, an\r\neconomic factor, a powerful missionary machine, an educational agency,\r\nand the pioneer of civilisation. It was not a negative force, but very\r\naggressive and made history. It led all the great reform movements. It\r\nwas uniform in spirit, though widely divergent in form. In some cases\r\nmonks were under abbots each with his own rule; others had no fixed\r\nabode--and many of them were tramps of the worst description, living on\r\ntheir holy calling.[213:1] Jerome, Ambrose, Augustine, and many other\r\nFathers have left sufficient complaints about the growing monastic\r\ndisorders. The need of a common rule, therefore, was generally felt in\r\norder to unify the highly varied, and in part highly doubtful forms of\r\nmonasticism.\r\n\r\nEarly efforts were made to meet that need. Jerome translated the rule of\r\nPachomius into Latin and it was used in parts of Italy. Rufinus brought\r\nthe rule of Basil the Great to Rome and it was adopted in southern Italy\r\nand in Gaul. The rule of Macarius was at least known in the West.\r\nCassian (c. 448) was the first, however, to write out for the cruder\r\nwestern institution a detailed constitution (c. 429). He had studied\r\nmonasticism in Egypt and drew up a very complete rule which covered all\r\nthe essential phases of cloister life. It was used in many cloisters\r\ntill the ninth century. During this early unorganised period Popes,\r\ncouncils, and even secular powers often tried to control and regulate\r\nmonasticism.\r\n\r\nThe great organiser and unifier of western monasticism, however, was St.\r\nBenedict (d. 543), \"the patriarch of the monks of the west.\"[213:2] Born\r\nof rich parents at Nursia in 480, he was sent to Rome to complete his\r\neducation. There he became disgusted with the vice about him, fled from\r\ncollege, family, and fortune, and at the age of sixteen, retired to a\r\ncave at Subiaco thirty miles from Rome. He became a severe ascetic, wore\r\na hair shirt and a monk's dress of skins, rolled in beds of thistles to\r\nsubdue the flesh, and chose to be ignorant and holy rather than educated\r\nand wicked. His fame soon attracted disciples and he established twelve\r\nmonasteries, with a dozen monks and a superior in each, but all under\r\nhis own supervision. Later he left Subiaco and went to Monte Cassino\r\nwhere he spent the closing years of his remarkable career. Monte Cassino\r\nbecame the capital of western monasticism.\r\n\r\nTo control his monks Benedict drew up in 529 the \"Holy Rule,\"[214:1]\r\nwhich became the basis for all western monastic orders and was a rival\r\nof St. Basil's rule in the East. The \"Holy Rule\" was the product of\r\nBenedict's own sad experience as hermit, cenobite, and superior, and\r\nalso of his observations concerning the monastic laxness which he saw on\r\nall hands. It consists of a prologue and chapters on seventy-three\r\ngovernmental, social, moral, liturgical, and penal subjects. The whole\r\nspirit and aim of the Rule were constructive and reformatory. It\r\nprovided for an organisation monarchial at the top and democratic at the\r\nbottom. Each monastery had an abbot elected for life by all the monks to\r\nrule the monastery in the place of Christ. The abbot chose the prior and\r\ndeans, on the basis of merit, with the approval of the monks, but minor\r\nofficials were named directly by the abbot. The important business\r\naffairs of the monastery were conducted by the abbot in consultation\r\nwith all the monks, but minor matters required only the advice of the\r\nsuperior officers. Admission was open to all ranks and classes of men\r\nabove eighteen on an equal footing after one year's probation. The two\r\nfundamental principles in this constitution were labour and obedience.\r\nIndolence was branded as the enemy of the soul. Each candidate had to\r\ntake the vow of obedience and constancy to the order; chastity and\r\npoverty of course being implied. A monk's day was minutely regulated,\r\naccording to the seasons, and consisted of an alternation of manual\r\nwork, study, and worship, with short intervals for food and rest. Labour\r\nwas thus regulated in the monastery somewhat as in an industrial\r\npenitentiary. The frugal meal was eaten in silence while some edifying\r\nselection was read. The monks had to renounce the world and give all the\r\nfruits of their labours to the monastery.\r\n\r\nObedience was regarded as the most meritorious and essential condition\r\nof all. Monasticism meant a generous sacrifice of self and implied a\r\nsurrender of the will to a superior. The monk must obey not only the\r\nabbot but also the requests of his brethren. Monks were treated as\r\nchildren grown up. They could not own property--not even the smallest\r\ntrifles; they were not allowed to walk abroad at will; if sent away,\r\nthey could not eat without the abbot's permission; they could not\r\nreceive letters from home; and they were sent to bed early. Once in the\r\norder the vow of stability prevented withdrawal. A violation of any of\r\nthe regulations entailed punishment: private admonition, exclusion from\r\ncommon prayer, whipping, and expulsion.\r\n\r\nThis Rule, all things considered, was mild, flexible, and general; with\r\norder, proportion, and regularity, yet brief, concise, and well tempered\r\nto the needs of western Europe[215:1]; hence like Aaron's rod it soon\r\nswallowed up the other rules in use. Before 600 it was supreme in Italy.\r\nIn 788 the Council of Aachen ordered it and no other to be used\r\nthroughout the kingdom of Charles the Great. In the ninth century it\r\nsuperseded the Isidore rule in Spain. It embraced likewise the Columban\r\nrule in western Europe and by the tenth century prevailed everywhere.\r\nUnder it the Benedictines had a remarkable history. At one time they had\r\n37,000 monasteries and altogether produced 24 Popes, 200 cardinals, 4000\r\nbishops, and 55,505 saints.[216:1] The Benedictine monasteries differed\r\nfrom later monastic bodies in the fact that they were quite independent\r\nof each other and had no common head. After the thirteenth century they\r\nwere surpassed by the Begging Orders and devoted themselves mostly to\r\nliterary pursuits, soon becoming \"more noted for learning than piety.\"\r\nTheir edition of the Church Fathers is a monument of scholarly\r\nindustry.[216:2] The order still exists, chiefly in Austria and Italy,\r\nand is noted mostly for its classical learning. They boast of 16,000\r\ndistinguished writers.\r\n\r\nThese early monasteries were like swarming bees in planting monastic\r\nsocieties in every part of western Europe. The passion grew until it\r\nbecame a veritable madness which seized the pious and lawless alike.\r\nPopes like Gregory I. praised the institution and promoted its interest\r\nin every possible way. Even kings like Carloman of the Franks, Rochis of\r\nthe Lombards, great statesmen like Cassiodorus, and others voluntarily\r\nbecame monks. Louis the Pious, the Roman Emperor, was prevented from\r\nthat course only by his nobles.[216:3] The monk was the leader and\r\npattern of the Middle Ages. Every father was ambitious to have his son\r\nenter that holy calling. To the quiet and peaceful abode of the\r\nmonastery, therefore, went not only the pious, but the student, those\r\nwho disliked the soldier's life, the disconsolate, the disgraced,\r\nthe disappointed, the indolent, and the weary. And this powerful\r\norganisation was utterly under the control of the great Roman Bishop and\r\nhis subordinates.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable growth of monasticism brought great wealth and political\r\npower, which were used in large measure to strengthen the Church. Kings\r\nand nobles made large grants of lands--especially Charles the Great and\r\nLouis the Pious. Besides many monks brought their possessions as gifts\r\nto the monastery and not infrequently powerful abbots took lands by\r\nforce. Monasticism thus gradually became secularised and also\r\nfeudalised. Monasteries were often used as prisons for deposed kings,\r\ncriminals, and clergy convicted of crime. The abbots were virtually\r\nsecular lords who ruled as local sovereigns, claimed immunity from tolls\r\nand taxes, went hunting and hawking, and even fought at the head of\r\ntheir troops. As a result the office of abbot became a coveted prize,\r\nfor the younger and the illegitimate sons of nobles.[217:1] What effect\r\nthis secularisation had upon the high ideals may be easily seen. Soon\r\nonly certain ceremonies distinguished the monks from the secular clergy.\r\n\r\nThe monks as such belong to the laity. Monasticism was viewed as a lay\r\ninstitution as late as the Council of Chalcedon (451)[217:2] when the\r\nlegal authority of the bishop over the monks of his diocese was\r\nrecognised. The monks were called _religiosi_ in contrast to the\r\n_seculares_, the priests. The monks were the \"regulars\" who formed the\r\nspiritual nobility and not the ruling class in the hierarchy. They\r\nformed another grade in the hierarchy between the clergy and the laity.\r\nBut after the fifth century the difference became less marked. Since\r\nmonasticism was considered the perfection of Christian life, it was\r\nnatural to choose the clergy from the monks. Gregory the Great was the\r\nfirst monk to be elected Pope. Monasteries were the theological\r\nseminaries to supply priests for the Church, hence the ignorant clergy\r\nlooked up to the educated monks. Still monks at first, because not\r\nordained, could not say mass nor hear confession. Each monastery kept a\r\npriest or an ordained monk to fulfil these duties. Abbots were usually\r\nin priestly orders.[218:1] In time, however, monks assumed the dress of\r\npriests and became ambitious for priestly powers,[218:2] especially\r\nafter the Council of Chalcedon, backed by the state, gave bishops\r\njurisdiction over cloisters. Often monasteries applied to the Pope for\r\nindependence from episcopal jurisdiction and were taken under the\r\nimmediate protection of the Bishop of Rome. By the sixth century monks\r\nwere classed in the popular mind with the clergy. In 827 a council at\r\nRome ordered that abbots should be in priests' orders. Monks now began\r\nto sit in and to control Church synods, and to exercise all the rights\r\nof the secular clergy, even to having parishes,[218:3] and thus became\r\npowerful rivals of the established priesthood.\r\n\r\nThe crystallisation of ascetic ideals into monastic institutions was\r\nattacked by heathenism and did not meet the unanimous approval of\r\nChristendom. Before Constantine the pagans denounced the hermits because\r\nthey were guilty of the treasonable act, from a Roman view, of fleeing\r\nfrom social and civic duties. After Constantine, when monasticism became\r\nthe \"fad,\" it was assailed by the aristocratic pagan families, who lost\r\nsons, and especially wives and daughters, in the maelstrom of\r\nenthusiasm, because it broke family ties and caused the neglect of\r\nobvious responsibilities. Julian, the imperial pagan reactionist, called\r\nit fanaticism and idolatry. Pagan poets like Libanus and Rutilius\r\ndenounced it as an institution \"hostile to light.\"\r\n\r\nWithin Christendom hostility came from Christian rulers like Valens,\r\nbecause monasticism withdrew civil and military strength from the state,\r\nwhen all was needed against the barbarians, and because it encouraged\r\nidleness and unproductiveness instead of useful activity and heroic\r\nvirtue[219:1]; from Christians of wealth and indulgence who felt rebuked\r\nby the earnestness, poverty, and holy zeal of an ascetic life; from the\r\nclergy who did not comprehend the significance of monasticism[219:2];\r\nand from the liberal party in the Church who took a saner view of\r\nsalvation and ethics. Jovinian (d. 406), like Luther, first a monk and\r\nthen a reformer, held these five points according to Jerome: (1) that\r\nvirgins, widows, and wives are all on an equality if good Christians;\r\n(2) that thankfully partaking of food is as efficacious as fasting; (3)\r\nthat spiritual baptism is as effectual in overcoming the devil as\r\nbaptism; (4) that all sins are equal; (5) that all rewards and\r\npunishments will be equal. Jerome answered him and Pope Siricius\r\nexcommunicated him and his followers as heretics (390).[220:1] Helvidius\r\nof Rome denounced the reverence for celibacy and declared that the\r\nmarriage state was as holy as that of virginity. Again Jerome wielded\r\nhis intellectual cudgel.[220:2] Bonasus, Bishop of Sardica, was\r\nexcommunicated for holding the same view (389). Vigilantius, an educated\r\nGallic slave, a disciple of Jovinian, attacked the necessity of\r\ncelibacy, denied the efficacy of virginity, opposed fasting and torture,\r\nridiculed relics, objected to candles, incense, and prayers for the\r\ndead, and doubted miracles. He was a Protestant living in the fifth\r\ncentury.[220:3] He too was assailed by Jerome and put under the papal\r\nban.[220:4] Ærius of Sebasta, a presbyter, called into question the need\r\nor value of fasts, prayers for the dead, the inequality of rank among\r\nthe clergy, and the celebration of Easter and of course was outlawed by\r\nthe Church.[220:5] Lactantius declared that the hermit life was that of\r\na beast rather than a man and treasonable to society. But all these loud\r\noutcries against the monks were branded as heresy and drowned in\r\ncounter-shouts of praise.\r\n\r\nWhen the results and influences of monasticism are carefully weighed, it\r\nis seen that the good and evil \"are blended together almost\r\ninextricably.\" These diametrically opposite effects are perplexing and\r\nastonishing. Conspicuous among the positive results are the following:\r\n\r\n1. _Religious._ The effort to save pure Christianity from the\r\nsecularised state-Church by carrying it to the desert or shutting it up\r\nin a monastery, produced the first great reform movement within the\r\nChristian Church. \"It was always the monks who saved the Church when\r\nsinking, emancipated her when becoming enslaved to the world, defended\r\nher when assailed.\"[221:1] Monasticism was, therefore, a realisation of\r\nthe ideal in Christianity. In no small sense it likewise paved the way\r\nfor the Reformation of the sixteenth century. The monastic conquest of\r\nChristianity left in its train higher ideals of a holy Christian life\r\nand a keener religious enthusiasm, and emphasised the necessity of\r\nhumility and purity. Likewise monasticism, through its aggressive\r\nmissionary efforts, completed the overthrow of heathenism in the Empire\r\nand in its stead planted the true faith over western Europe. The monks\r\nwere the fiercest champions of orthodoxy, and the intellectual giants of\r\nthat age, like Jerome and St. Augustine, were in their ranks. The monk\r\nrather than the priest was the apostle of the Middle Ages who taught men\r\nand nations the simple Christian life of the Gospel. In monasticism were\r\ndeveloped the germs of many humanitarian institutions through which\r\nChristianity expressed itself in a most practical manner. The monastery\r\noffered a home to the poor and unfortunate, and gave hope and refuge to\r\nboth the religious invalid, who was sick of the world, and to the\r\nreligious fanatic. The Papacy, too, was supported and strengthened in a\r\nthousand different ways by monasticism, and the whole religious history\r\nof the Middle Ages was coloured by it.\r\n\r\n2. _Social._ Monasticism tended to purify and regenerate society with\r\nlofty ideas. It became an unexcelled machine for the administration of\r\ncharity. It fed the hungry, cared for the sick and dying, entertained\r\nthe traveller, and was an asylum for all the unfortunates. It helped to\r\nmitigate the terrors of slavery. It inculcated ideas of obedience and\r\nusefulness. It advocated and practised equality and communism, and it\r\ntutored the half-civilised nations of western Europe in the arts of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n3. _Political._ In its organisation and practical life it kept alive\r\nideas of democracy. From the ranks of the monks came many of the best\r\nstatesmen in the various European governments. Monastic zeal had much to\r\ndo in saving the Roman Empire from utter destruction at the hands of the\r\nbarbarians and in helping to preserve imperial ideas until the rough\r\nTeutons were Latinised in their legal and political institutions. In\r\naddition the monks helped to form the various law codes of the German\r\ntribes, put them into written form, and took an active part in many\r\nforms of local government. In many an instance they saved the\r\nunprotected vassal from the tyrannical noble.\r\n\r\n4. _Educational._ In the monasteries the torches of civilisation and\r\nlearning were kept burning during the so-called Dark Ages. The first\r\nmusicians, painters, sculptors, architects, and educators of Christian\r\nEurope were monks. They not only established the schools, and were the\r\nschoolmasters in them, but also laid the foundations for the\r\nuniversities. They were the thinkers and philosophers of the day and\r\nshaped the political and religious thought. To them, both collectively\r\nand individually, was due the continuity of thought and civilisation of\r\nthe ancient world with the later Middle Ages and with the modern period.\r\n\r\n5. _Industrial._ Not only did the monks develop the various arts such as\r\ncopying and illuminating books, building religious edifices, painting,\r\nand carving, but they also became the model farmers and horticulturists\r\nof Europe. Every Benedictine monastery was an agricultural college for\r\nthe whole region in which it was located. By making manual labour an\r\nessential part of monastic life, labour was greatly ennobled above the\r\ndisreputable position it held among the Romans.\r\n\r\nThe negative effects of monasticism were by no means lacking and may be\r\nstated here under the same institutional headings:\r\n\r\n1. _Religious._ In making \"war on nature\" the ascetics made war also on\r\nGod. They aimed not too high religiously but in the wrong direction.\r\nThey exaggerated sin and advocated the wrong means to get rid of it.\r\nThey took religion away from the crowded centres of population, where it\r\nwas most needed, to the desert or monastery. Thus an abnormal,\r\nunwholesome type of piety was created. In replacing faith by works the\r\nmonks thus gave birth to a long list of abuses in the Church, and in\r\nnourishing an insane religious fanaticism they entailed many grave\r\nevils. From one point of view monasticism became a \"morbid excrescence\"\r\nof Christianity and tended to degrade man into a mere religious machine.\r\nAt the same time the doctrine of future rewards and punishments reached\r\nan abhorrent evolution. The awful pangs of hell, the terrific judgments\r\nof God, and the ubiquitous and wily devil of the monks' vivid\r\nimagination sound strange to a modern mind. But the gravest error in\r\nthe monastic system was the false and harmful distinction so clearly\r\ndrawn both in theory and practice between the secular and the religious.\r\nThe modern world easily harmonises the two.\r\n\r\n2. _Social._ Monasticism disrupted family ties and caused the desertion\r\nof social duties on the ground of a more sacred duty. It lowered respect\r\nfor the marriage state by magnifying the virtue of celibacy. In making\r\nthe monk the ideal man of the Middle Ages, it advocated social suicide.\r\nAll natural pleasures and enjoyments of life were labelled sinful.\r\nPractices, which were little more than superstitions, were advocated.\r\nSociety in general was demoralised because monasticism failed to\r\npractise its own teachings.\r\n\r\n3. _Political._ By inducing thousands, and many of them men of\r\ncharacter, ability, and experience, to desert their posts of civic duty,\r\nthe state was weakened and patriotism forgotten. The monk \"died to the\r\nworld\" and abjured his country. Monasticism aided powerfully in\r\ndeveloping the secular side of the papal hierarchy and soon came to\r\nexercise a large amount of political power itself. The monks frequently\r\nbecame embroiled in social disputes and military quarrels, and thus\r\nincited rather than allayed the fiercer brute passions of men.\r\n\r\n4. _Cultural._ By holding the education of the people in their hands the\r\nmonks had a powerful weapon for evil as well as good. In making the monk\r\nthe ideally cultured man a false standard was set up and certain\r\nfundamentals in education ignored. Secular learning was not generally\r\nencouraged. The supreme end of all their education was not to produce a\r\nman, but a priest.\r\n\r\n5. _Industrial._ Thousands withdrew from the various lines of\r\nindustrial activity, some to obtain the higher good, but many to enter\r\nas they supposed a life of ease and idleness. Much of the good that was\r\ndone in the earlier days was negatived by the begging friars later.\r\n\r\nOf these two sets of influences which predominated? That both were\r\npowerful no one can doubt. All things considered, however, it must be\r\nsaid that monasticism, as it developed in the West, fulfilled a genuine\r\nneed and performed an important service for Christian civilisation. St.\r\nBenedict not only presented a satisfactory solution of the grave dangers\r\nthreatening this institution as a force in the evolution of the mediæval\r\nChurch, but with his organised army of devoted, obedient followers, he\r\nmet the barbarian hosts invading the Roman Empire and gradually won them\r\nto adopt and in due course of time to practise the Christian code.\r\nIndeed it is difficult to imagine how the Church could have forged its\r\ncourse so triumphantly through all the breakers, trials, and\r\nvicissitudes of this crucial epoch--how its jurisdiction could have been\r\nextended so rapidly and so effectively to all parts of western Europe\r\nand to some points in the East and in northern Africa--how its great\r\nhumanising, spiritualising, and edifying influences could have been so\r\npersistent and at the same time so efficient--how the simple,\r\nfundamental truths of the Gospel as set forth in the Apostolic Church\r\ncould have been handed on to the later ages--had not the growth of\r\nmonasticism been regulated and utilised. Therefore, next to the\r\nevolution of that magnificent organisation of the Papacy, as a creative\r\nfactor in the rise of the mediæval Church, must be placed organised,\r\nwestern monasticism.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nA.--PRIMARY:\r\n\r\n    I.--JEWISH:\r\n\r\n     1.--_Old Testament._\r\n\r\n     2.--Josephus, _Antiquities_, i., bk. 15, ch. 10, sec. 4-5; bk.\r\n          18, ch. 1, sec. 5; ii., bk. 2, ch. 8, sec. 2-11.\r\n\r\n     3.--Philo, _Contemplative Life_.

The command came in very distinct terms\r\nfrom the Master himself.[229:1] But there was no recognised principle of\r\npropagandism and no special organisations to carry on the work. Each\r\nChristian felt the individual obligation to win his fellows to the new\r\nfaith. Separate churches no doubt naturally felt the necessity of some\r\ncorporate action to convert the heathen in the neighbourhood. Prayers,\r\nindeed, for the conversion of the heathen were early made an integral\r\npart of the liturgies of the Church, East and West.[229:2] The actual\r\ndiffusion of Christianity, however, proceeded in a special sense from\r\nthe evangelical labours of the individual bishops[229:3] and the\r\nclergy. In fact missionary work was regarded as one of their specific\r\nduties handed down from the Apostles. With the development of the\r\norganisation of the Church and the appearance of patriarchs arose the\r\nthought that it was the duty of these powerful centres to carry on\r\nmissionary activity in foreign fields. Monasticism was early utilised\r\nfor this important work. It must never be forgotten that the aggressive\r\nevangelising efforts of the early Church were mainly those of the West,\r\nand here is seen another powerful factor in the rise of the mediæval\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nThe conception early developed in the Church that the spread of God's\r\nKingdom on earth was a warfare. That idea was founded on the words of\r\nJesus,[230:1] on the assertions of the Apostles, and on the sacrifices\r\nof the early martyrs. Monasticism made this conviction peculiarly\r\npersonal. The organised Church asserted it on every occasion. The\r\nconversion of the barbarians was viewed, in a broad sense, as an\r\ninvasion and a conquest. It was a campaign with all western Europe as\r\nits field. In time it covered six centuries or more. The generals, the\r\nable strategists, were the competent and zealous Roman pontiffs, and the\r\nsubordinate officers were emperors, kings, princes, bishops, and abbots.\r\nThe army was that great host of devoted monks, of consecrated priests,\r\nand earnest Christian laymen. The weapons in the hands of these\r\nconquerors were Christian love and sympathy. They were driven on by an\r\nirresistible zeal for saving souls. They were clothed in the power of\r\npoverty, austerity, suffering, obedience, and self-denial. The conflict\r\nwas one which, in its outcome, was to shape the destiny of the world.\r\n\r\nThe man above all others who was carried away by this dream of duty for\r\nthe Church militant in winning those outside the true Church to\r\nmembership, was the monk-Pope, Gregory the Great. Pagan Rome had failed\r\nto make a complete and permanent conquest of the barbarians. Christian\r\nRome, inspired by this master spirit, was to succeed in conquering both\r\nthe bodies and the souls of the barbarians, and to use them for her own\r\nglory.\r\n\r\nWhen Gregory the Great died in 604, Christendom practically covered the\r\nRoman Empire and at certain points extended beyond it. Those who bore\r\nthe name Christian included Jews, Romans, Greeks, Celts, and Germans.\r\nThe Christian world was already divided into two great branches--the\r\nEastern, or Greek Church, and the Western, or Roman Church,--which were\r\nbecoming more and more pronounced in their differences.\r\n\r\nThe Christian missionary work, from the sixth to the twelfth century,\r\nmust be viewed broadly as a process of civilisation, since the\r\nmissionaries carried with them intellectual light, as well as spiritual\r\ntruth, and paved the way for law and justice. They opened up channels\r\nthrough which the higher ideals and better institutions of the south\r\nmight work northward to revolutionise agriculture, trade, social life,\r\nand general economic conditions. \"The experience of all ages,\" said\r\nNeander, \"teaches us that Christianity has only made a firm and living\r\nprogress, where from the first it has brought with it the seeds of all\r\nhuman culture, although they have only been developed by\r\ndegrees.\"[231:1]\r\n\r\nMediæval conversion to Christianity was, as a rule, tribal, or national,\r\nrather than individual, or personal, and consequently it took some time\r\nbefore satisfactory fruitage was noticeable in the lives of the people.\r\nBut it was a great victory to substitute the Christian for the pagan\r\nideal. The agencies employed to carry out this process of conversion\r\nwere: (1) missionaries, mostly Latin, Celtic, English, German, Greek,\r\nand Slavic monks; (2) the sword in the hands of a stern ruler; (3) the\r\nmarriage of Christian women to pagan kings and princes; and (4) the\r\nrecognised superiority of Christianity, Christian institutions, and\r\nChristian nations. It must be borne in mind, likewise, that some of the\r\nGerman tribes settled in the very heart of Christendom where Christian\r\ninfluences could operate directly and immediately.\r\n\r\nThe earliest successful conversion of the Teutons was to Arianism. That\r\nwork was begun at least as early as the time of Constantine, because a\r\nGothic bishop sat in the Council of Nicæa (325). Bishop Ulfilas (d.\r\n381), the \"Apostle to the Goths,\" called by Constantine the Great \"the\r\nMoses of the Goths,\"[232:1] translated the Bible into Gothic[232:2] and\r\nwon his countrymen to Arianism. St. Chrysostom in 404 established in\r\nConstantinople a school for the training of Gothic missionaries.[232:3]\r\nThe Ostrogoths, Visigoths, Burgundians, and Vandals all embraced that\r\nfaith. But the fervent and more aggressive missionary zeal of Rome\r\ngradually replaced Arianism in western Europe with orthodox\r\nChristianity--the Burgundians in 517, the Suevi in 550, the Visigoths\r\nin 587, the Lombards, the last stronghold of Arianism in the West, in\r\nthe eighth century.\r\n\r\nThe unparalleled missionary activity of the Roman Church was due of\r\ncourse primarily to religious enthusiasm, but other causes must also be\r\ntaken into account. As a matter of self-preservation to protect herself\r\nfrom the inveterate paganism of the ancient world, on the one hand, and\r\nfrom the torrent of barbaric invaders, on the other, the conflict was\r\nthrust upon Rome and she must conquer or perish. Again the development\r\nof the hierarchy along the lines of the Petrine theory made it\r\nimperative that Rome should win and rule the West. The wise policy of\r\nwinning kings first and nations afterwards was simply adopted from Roman\r\nimperial practice but it was eminently successful. It likewise enabled\r\nthe Pope of Rome to control all missionary enterprise from his\r\necclesiastical capital, and to employ it for the further extension of\r\nthe papal prerogative.\r\n\r\nThe results of the spread of Christianity over the Græco-Roman world\r\nhave already been considered. That conquest decidedly modified the\r\nApostolic Church in organisation, in ceremony, and in doctrine, and laid\r\nthe foundations for the Roman and Greek Churches. The Romanised,\r\nmonasticised Christian Church over which Gregory the Great ruled reveals\r\nthe product of all these early influences. The conversion of the Teutons\r\nto Roman Christianity marks another new epoch not only in the history of\r\nthe Church, but also in the history of the world. Just as from the\r\nApostolic Church emerged the Roman Church with its pronounced\r\ndifferences, so from the Roman Church evolved the Teutonic-Roman Church,\r\nwhich in turn was strikingly unlike its prototype in several\r\nparticulars. The Germanised Roman Church declared its absolute\r\nindependence of the Eastern Emperor and launched out on a new world\r\ncareer. The product of all these elements was the mediæval Church which\r\nstood for primitive Christianity modified first by a growth covering\r\nfive centuries through a stratum of Roman civilisation, and secondly for\r\nseven centuries through a superimposed stratum of Germanic civilisation.\r\n\r\nWhen the pagan Franks began their conquest of Gaul (486), they\r\nencountered a civilisation that was nominally Christian. Their king,\r\nClovis, married Clotilda, a Christian princess, the daughter of the\r\nBurgundian king[234:1] (493). She no doubt laboured with her lord and\r\nmaster to induce him to embrace her faith. He permitted his child to be\r\nbaptised in accordance with the Christian rite and tolerated Christian\r\npriests and monks as a matter of policy, but that was all. At length in\r\na battle with the stubborn Alemanni, Clovis, hard-pressed, prayed to the\r\nChristian God and promised to turn Christian himself in exchange for\r\nvictory. His foes fled and left him conqueror. True to his vow, Clovis,\r\nafter receiving instruction from Bishop Remigius of Rheims, was baptised\r\non Christmas day 496 and with him 3000 warriors. This important event,\r\n\"the first step toward the world-historical union of Teutonic\r\ncivilisation with the Roman Church,\"[234:2] paved the way for Charles\r\nthe Great, and made possible a Christian France. This event was a\r\nsignificant victory for the Nicene Creed and for the Pope of Rome.\r\nOrthodoxy and Roman dominion now advanced side by side with Frankish\r\nconquests until both became absolutely independent of the imperial\r\npower in the East.[235:1]\r\n\r\nThe Romans abandoned the island of Britain in 409 for ever. About 450\r\nthe pagan kinsmen of the Franks, namely the Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and\r\nFrisians, crossed to Britain and there found the Christian Church\r\nalready planted.[235:2] They drove it back to Wales, Ireland, and\r\nScotland, or crushed it out altogether. The Christian Celts, who were\r\nthus treated, made no effort at first to convert their heathen\r\nconquerors.[235:3] That was left to missionaries from Rome under the\r\nleadership of the monk Augustine. Bede, the venerable Church historian,\r\ntells the pious tale of how Gregory the Great, before being made Pope,\r\nsaw in the slave market of Rome some boys \"of a white body and fair\r\ncountenance\" and forthwith became so deeply interested in them and their\r\nland that he begged the Pope to send him as missionary to\r\nBritain.[235:4] The Romans, it is said, refused to allow him to go, and\r\nsoon honoured him with the tiara of St. Peter. As Pope, however, he\r\ncarried out his intention by sending Augustine, a Benedictine abbot,\r\nwith forty monks and Gallic interpreters and with letters and a library\r\nof sacred literature, to England in 596 to begin the work.[235:5]\r\n\r\nNow it happened that Ethelbert, the King of Kent, had married Bertha, a\r\nChristian princess from Paris, who had been permitted to take a Gallic\r\nbishop with her to England. Thus the way had been already opened for the\r\nfavourable reception of the monks under the guidance of Augustine, which\r\nled in 597 to the conversion of Ethelbert at Canterbury, and with him\r\nnominally the whole kingdom of Kent. At the first Christmas festival\r\nEthelbert and 10,000 of his subjects were baptised. Thus Roman\r\nChristianity became at once the established state Church and \"everywhere\r\nthe bishop's throne was set up side by side with the king's.\"[236:1]\r\nAugustine, as a reward for his successful services, was soon made the\r\nfirst archbishop of England[236:2] and proceeded to organise the Church\r\nby sending to Rome for more helpers, by appointing bishops and priests\r\nto particular fields of labour, by purifying pagan temples and\r\ndedicating them to Christian services, and by repairing and building\r\nChristian churches and monasteries. As a result of the sincere,\r\npractical measures adopted by Augustine, thousands were soon won to the\r\nnew faith and Christianity was permanently replanted in the British\r\nIslands. The work, so well begun, was continued until Sussex, the last\r\nkingdom of the heptarchy, in 604, embraced the popular religion. Pope\r\nGregory the Great took a keen interest in this grand triumph and made it\r\ncontribute to the glory of the Roman Church.[236:3]\r\n\r\nThe monks sent to England by Pope Gregory the Great soon came to see\r\nthat the Celtic Church differed from theirs in many respects. Augustine\r\nhimself, having concluded an alliance between Ethelbert and the Roman\r\nSee, held several conferences with the Christian Celts in order to\r\naccomplish the most difficult task of their subjugation to Roman\r\nauthority. These differences were largely ritualistic and disciplinary.\r\nThe Celtic Christians celebrated Easter according to the calculation of\r\nSulpicius Severus, while the Romans had another mode of computing the\r\nproper day.[237:1] The Celts appealed to St. John, the Romans to St.\r\nPeter.[237:2] The Celtic Church might be called a monastic Church, since\r\nthe abbot ruled over the bishop.[237:3] The Celts shaved the front of\r\nthe head from ear to ear as a tonsure, while the Romans shaved the top\r\nof the head leaving a \"crown of thorns.\"[237:4] The Celts permitted\r\ntheir priests to marry, the Romans forbade it. The Celts used a\r\ndifferent mode of baptism from that of the Romans, namely, single\r\ninstead of trine immersion. The calendar for all movable festivals was\r\nnot the same. The Celts held their own councils and enacted their own\r\nlaws, independent of Rome. The Celts used a Latin Bible unlike the\r\nVulgate, and kept Saturday as a day of rest, with special religious\r\nservices on Sunday.[237:5] Notwithstanding these variances, which do\r\nnot seem to be at all on the fundamentals, there were many doctrinal and\r\nconstitutional resemblances. Both churches were orthodox; both used a\r\nLatin ritual[238:1]; both had developed an episcopal organisation; both\r\nbelieved in monasticism; and both were actively engaged in missionary\r\nwork. Nevertheless the British Christians looked with much disfavour\r\nupon the Augustine mission to convert their pagan conquerors and\r\noppressors.\r\n\r\nKing Ethelbert in 602 arranged a conference of British and Roman bishops\r\non the Severn in Essex.[238:2] At that gathering Augustine with\r\nunreasonable rigour and haughtiness demanded conformity; the Britains\r\nrefused to surrender their independence. To settle the matter Augustine\r\nproposed that an appeal be made to a miracle. Accordingly a blind\r\nAnglo-Saxon was brought in. The Celtic clergy prayed over him in vain.\r\nWhereupon Augustine knelt and prayed, and immediately the blind man was\r\nrestored to sight,[238:3] but the Celts refused to accept that act as\r\nfinal without the consent of a larger representation in the synod. The\r\nnext year, therefore, a second council was held at which the persistent\r\nAugustine once more demanded conformity to Roman practices and the\r\nrecognition of papal supremacy, and also requested missionary\r\nco-operation, but the Britains, displeased with Augustine's narrow\r\ndogmatism and apprehensive of the loss of their freedom, refused to\r\nsubmit. \"As you will not have peace with brethren,\" said the stern Roman\r\nmonk, \"you shall have war from foes; and as you will not preach unto\r\nthe English the way of life, you shall suffer at their hands the\r\nvengeance of death.\"[239:1] When, ten years later, a wholesale Saxon\r\nmassacre of British Christians occurred, in which possibly a thousand\r\npriests and monks were slaughtered and many churches and monasteries\r\ndestroyed, further conferences were at an end for fifty years.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 664 that the famous Council of Whitby was called by\r\nKing Oswy of Northumbria in which Bishop Colman and Bishop Cedd,\r\nrenowned Celtic divines, defended the British Church; while Bishop\r\nAgilbert, and Wilfred, the greatest English ecclesiastic of his time,\r\nchampioned Rome. In the discussion about the correct day for Easter, it\r\nwas asserted by Wilfred that St. Peter held \"the keys to the kingdom of\r\nHeaven.\" The king then asked Colman and the monks with him whether that\r\nwas true, and they were forced to confess that it was. Consequently,\r\nfeeling that it was safer to be on the side of Peter, the \"doorkeeper,\"\r\nthe king decided in favour of the Church of Rome.[239:2] This was a very\r\nsignificant victory for the See of St. Peter, because papal supremacy\r\nwas now recognised in the British Isles, and likewise for the future of\r\nEngland, because it opened up a channel through which Roman Christian\r\ncivilisation flowed into the British Isles to influence to a greater or\r\nless degree every institution in that country and, later, through the\r\ngreat empire which England was to build up to carry those cultural\r\ninfluences around the world. The work of cementing the Latin and Celtic\r\nchurches in England into one was completed by Theodorus, the Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury (d. 690), and the Venerable Bede (d. 735). Ecclesiastical\r\nunity hastened political unity in England[240:1] and developed a common\r\ncivic life among the divided peoples of the British Isles.[240:2]\r\n\r\nChristianity had early spread from Britain to Ireland. The labours of\r\nSt. Patrick[240:3] (d. 493) and the work of St. Bridget, the \"Mary of\r\nIreland\" (d. 525), have become classics. The Anglo-Saxon invasion drove\r\nmany Christians to Ireland in the fifth and sixth centuries, so that by\r\nthe seventh century Ireland had become the \"Island of Saints\" and the\r\nwhole island was Christianised. Many famous monasteries were planted,\r\nand an intense missionary zeal had sent to Scotland, North\r\nBritain,[240:4] France, Germany, Switzerland, and northern Italy many\r\nrepresentatives of the Celtic Church.\r\n\r\nIn 629, Pope Honorius exhorted the Irish Church to conform to the Roman\r\nEaster day. A Celtic deputation was then sent to Rome and, upon\r\nreturning home, reported in favour of the Latin system, which was\r\nadopted first in southern Ireland in 632, then in northern Ireland in\r\n640, and by 704 was generally observed. The Norman Conquest, in 1066,\r\nmade the union of Ireland with Rome as well as with England more\r\ncomplete; but it was left to Henry II., who conquered Ireland in 1171,\r\nto give finality to the dependence of Ireland on Rome religiously and on\r\nEngland politically.\r\n\r\nChristianity was planted in Scotland during the Roman period.[241:1] An\r\nIrish colony, converted by St. Patrick, settled there in the fifth\r\ncentury. The labours of St. Ninian (sixth cent.), the work of St.\r\nKentigern (d. 603), and the activity of St. Columba (d. 597) completed\r\nthe conversion of the country. St. Columba was a famous Irish\r\nmissionary, who went to Scotland in 563, there converted the king of the\r\nPicts and founded many churches. He made his headquarters on the small\r\nisland of Iona on which was planted a monastery famous as a school for\r\nmissionaries, as the centre of educational activity, and as the Rome of\r\nthe Celtic Church.[241:2] For centuries the Celtic Church maintained its\r\nindependence in Scotland, but gradually gave way to the better organised\r\nand more aggressive Roman Church, though the Culdees were not absorbed\r\nuntil 1332.[241:3]\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm of the Celtic and English Christians soon attained such\r\nproportions that it overflowed and swept back upon the continent like a\r\nmighty tidal wave. The great pioneer in that movement was Columbanus. He\r\nwas born in Leinster about 543 and received his monastic education at\r\nBangor. At the age of forty he conceived the idea of preaching the\r\nGospel to the pagan German tribes. With twelve young companions he\r\ncrossed over to France where they remained several years, teaching the\r\nfaith. Then they went to Burgundy where King Gontran persuaded them to\r\nbuild a monastery. For twenty years Columbanus laboured in the wild\r\nVosges Mountains, planted the three famous monasteries of Anegray,\r\nLuxeuil, and Fontaines. Luxeuil virtually became the \"monastic capital\r\nof France.\"[242:1] He gave his monks a stringent rule, borrowed from the\r\nrigid discipline of the Celtic monasteries, and he clung to the peculiar\r\nrites and usages of his mother Church. His influence was strongly felt\r\nand an army of disciples gathered around him. From his mountain home he\r\nsent forth reformatory waves that covered all Europe, and posed as sort\r\nof a spiritual dictator of the whole Church.\r\n\r\nAnother result of his influence was to incite the enmity of the Gallican\r\nclergy and the Burgundian court. In 602, he was arraigned before a\r\nFrankish synod, but he ably defended his life and his beliefs. This\r\naffront led him to appeal to Pope Gregory the Great in several\r\ninteresting letters. At last, in 610, he was banished from the\r\nBurgundian kingdom never to return. He went to Tours, Nantes, Metz, up\r\nthe Rhine valley, and into Switzerland where he remained three years\r\nengaged in active missionary work until forced to leave by Burgundian\r\ninfluence. Crossing the Alps into Lombardy he received an honourable\r\nwelcome from King Agilulf and was given a site for the celebrated\r\nmonastery of Bobbio where, in 615, he passed away in peace. To him must\r\nbe given the credit of opening up Europe to England and Ireland as an\r\nexcellent field for foreign missions.[243:1]\r\n\r\nGallus,[243:2] an Irish companion of Columbanus, called the \"Apostle of\r\nSwitzerland,\" laboured among the Alemanni and Swabians. His monastery of\r\nSt. Gall became one of the great centres of learning in the Middle Ages.\r\nHe died in 645. Three other Irish monks of note worked in Germany.\r\nFridolin founded a monastery on the Rhine near Basle. Trudbert went into\r\nthe Black Forest and became a martyr to the cause. Kylian, the \"Apostle\r\nof Franconia,\" went to Würzburg where he met with considerable success\r\nbut lost his life.\r\n\r\nThe English were early drawn into this ardent missionary impulse. More\r\nmissionaries were sent to Europe in the seventh and eighth centuries\r\nfrom England than go to-day to foreign fields.[243:3] Willibrord,[243:4]\r\na native of Northumberland, educated in Ireland, embarked in 690 with\r\nseven assistants for Frisia at the mouth of the Rhine. The native prince\r\nwas Radbod, an uncompromising pagan. Acting on the advice of Pepin of\r\nFrance he went to Rome and was invested with the bishopric of Utrecht.\r\nHe then evangelised parts of Frankish Frisia, after which he visited\r\nDenmark. After a zealous career of half a century he died in 740. Other\r\nEnglishmen followed in his wake. Adelbert laboured in the north of\r\nHolland, Werenfrid near Elste, and Wiro among the natives of Guldres.\r\nThe Ewald brothers were slain by the savage Saxons.[244:1] Wulfram, the\r\nBishop of Sens, made excellent headway among Radbod's Frisians.[244:2]\r\nIndeed the zeal of these northern missionaries might have planted the\r\nCeltic Church firmly on the continent, had they not been so sadly\r\ndeficient in capacity for organisation and had the Pope of Rome not been\r\nso zealously watchful.\r\n\r\nRoman colonies on the Rhine in the third and fourth centuries first\r\ncarried Christianity into Germany. In the Council of Arles (314) there\r\nwere present a bishop and a deacon from Cologne, and a bishop from\r\nTreves. By the fifth century Christianity had been spread by\r\nSeverinus,[244:3] an Italian monk, into Bavaria along the Danube.\r\n\r\nIt was really left to St. Boniface,[244:4] the \"Apostle of Germany,\" to\r\norganise and unify the work already done, and to subject the Christian\r\nChurch in Germany planted by his predecessors, to Rome. He was a most\r\nremarkable character and played an important part in the\r\nChristianisation of the Teutonic peoples. Born in 680 in Devonshire,\r\nEngland, of noble Saxon family, he early entered the monastery at\r\nExeter, where he received an excellent education for that day. He soon\r\nevinced a longing for the life of a monk. His father gave his consent\r\nreluctantly, and he assumed monastic vows in a monastery near\r\nWinchester. He became a famous preacher and expounder of Scripture, and\r\nat the age of thirty was ordained priest. He now felt called upon to\r\ncarry the Gospel to the land of his ancestors. Consequently in 716, with\r\ntwo or three fellow-monks as companions, he crossed from London to\r\nFrisia to begin his missionary labours as the successor of Willibrord,\r\nwhose successes had been largely reversed. Radbod, the baptised Frisian\r\nking, had backslid when he learned that his pagan forefathers were among\r\nthe damned. He declared that he preferred \"to be there with his\r\nancestors rather than in heaven with a handful of beggars.\"[245:1] Hence\r\nhe had devastated the Christian churches and monasteries, and was now at\r\nwar with Charles Martel. King Radbod met Boniface, but refused to permit\r\nhim to preach, so Boniface returned to England without having\r\naccomplished anything.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the failure of this first enterprise, Boniface left\r\nEngland again in 718 and for ever; and now went through France to Rome\r\nto obtain papal sanction for his future missionary work. Pope Gregory\r\nII. formally commissioned him as missionary to the German tribes (719).\r\nArmed with that letter and many precious relics, he started north the\r\nfollowing spring to his field of labour. First, he went to Thuringia and\r\nBavaria, regions already partly Christianised, but at this time\r\nconsiderably disorganised, and demanded their submission to Rome; then,\r\nlearning of King Radbod's death (719), he hastened to Frisia, where he\r\nlaboured for three years with Willibrord, who had meantime returned to\r\ncontinue his labours. In 722 he passed through Thuringia and entered\r\nHesse where, within a short time, he converted two local chiefs together\r\nwith many thousands of their followers. A foothold was thus secured by\r\nRome in the pagan world of Germany and never again lost.\r\n\r\nThese successes led the Pope to recall Boniface to Rome to receive\r\ndirections concerning conditions in Germany. After exacting from him a\r\nconfession of faith in the Trinity, and binding him by an oath ever to\r\nrespect papal authority,[246:1] the Supreme Pontiff created him\r\nmissionary bishop in 723. Boniface then returned to Germany with a code\r\nof laws for the Church, and with letters of introduction to Charles\r\nMartel and to other influential persons who might aid him. He was aware\r\nthat little could be done without the assistance of that powerful ruler\r\nand wrote: \"Without the protection of the Prince of the Franks, I could\r\nneither rule the people of the Church, nor defend the priests or clerks,\r\nthe monks or handmaidens of God; nor have I the power to restrain pagan\r\nrites and idolatry in Germany without his mandate and the awe of his\r\nname.\"[246:2] Hence he attached himself for awhile to the court of the\r\nFrankish ruler before he began the work so near his heart. Hesse and\r\nThuringia, Christianised nominally by Celtic missionaries and\r\nconsequently under no episcopal authority, refused to recognise papal\r\njurisdiction. To awe them into submission, Boniface cut down their\r\ngigantic sacred oak at Geismar and from it, subsequently, built a chapel\r\nto St. Peter. The people were convinced and received the new faith.\r\nWith the aid of Charles Martel, the assistance of the pope, and the\r\nhelp of English missionaries who joined him, Boniface completed his\r\nconquest of that region, filled it with churches and monasteries, and\r\nextended papal rule over it. Schools were established, learning and a\r\nhigher civilisation began to flow in from England and Rome, and the dark\r\ndays of paganism were gone.\r\n\r\nAs a reward for his labours, Pope Gregory III., who received the papal\r\ncrown in 731, raised Boniface in 732 to the dignity of missionary\r\narchbishop. This new authority enabled him to coerce refractory bishops\r\nwho thwarted his efforts. Five years later, Boniface made his third and\r\nlast visit to Rome, not now as an obscure missionary but with a great\r\nretinue of monks and converts. Once more returning to Germany with\r\nauthority, he organised the Church in Bavaria (739) and thus curtailed\r\necclesiastical lawlessness by creating four bishoprics: Salzburg,\r\nFriesingen, Passau, and Regensburg. In the year 742, continuing the work\r\nof organisation begun so well in Bavaria, he succeeded in creating in\r\ncentral Germany the bishoprics of Würzburg, Buraburg, Erfurt, and\r\nEichstädt. To organise the Church and regulate ecclesiastical affairs,\r\nhe held numerous synods. At the same time, he laboured hard to enforce\r\ncelibacy, to restore Church property alienated by rulers, and to\r\nsuppress heresy. In 743, he was made archbishop of Mainz, with\r\njurisdiction over a region from Cologne to Strassburg and from Coire to\r\nWorms, and now sought to complete the work of consolidating the German\r\nChurch. By this time, he had become not only the head of the Church in\r\nGermany, but was recognised as a powerful factor in political matters.\r\nIt is even reported that he crowned Pepin at Soissons (752).[248:1] The\r\ngreat monastery of Fulda was founded (744) and it was destined to become\r\nthe head of the Benedictine institutions in Germany. Having appointed\r\nLull as his successor at Mainz, he resigned in 754, returned a third\r\ntime to Frisia as a missionary, and there was slain in 755 as a martyr\r\nto the Christian cause. Boniface did more than any other one individual\r\nto carry Christianity to the German peoples and to tie the Church of\r\nGermany firmly to the papal throne. He was a civiliser and law-giver as\r\nwell as a Roman missionary.[248:2] After the Apostle Paul he was\r\nprobably the most eminent in missionary endeavour.\r\n\r\nHis work was continued by his disciple Willibald (b. 700), a relative, a\r\npilgrim to Rome and the Holy Land, and a Benedictine monk, who was made\r\nbishop of Eichstädt (741). He called his brother, sister, and others\r\nfrom England as missionaries into Germany. He founded Benedictine\r\nmonasteries, and it is thought by some that he wrote a biography of his\r\ngreat leader (d. 781). Gregory, an abbot of Utrecht, a Merovingian\r\nprince converted by Boniface, worked with his master and took charge of\r\nthe Frisian mission after his death (755). Sturm, the first abbot of\r\nFulda (710-779),[248:3] a Bavarian nobleman educated by Boniface, had\r\nhis teacher's bones buried at Fulda and served for years as a missionary\r\namong the Saxons (d. 779). Charles the Great gave him support and\r\nencouragement.\r\n\r\nAnother means used to convert the Germans was the sword. This was\r\nespecially true of the Saxons, a sturdy, defiant, warlike people, who\r\nlived in Hanover, Oldenburg, and Westphalia.[249:1] They were the last\r\nto accept Christianity, because they hated the Franks and far-off Rome.\r\nFruitless efforts to convert them had been made by the Ewald brothers,\r\nSuidbert, and others. The work was left, however, for Charles the Great,\r\nwho consumed thirty-three years in subjecting them to Christian rule\r\n(772-805).[249:2] This was done only after five thousand inhabitants had\r\nbeen massacred at Verdun, ten thousand families had been exiled in 804,\r\nand bloody laws were enacted against relapse into paganism. This new\r\ntype of missionary work, which was a radical departure from the\r\napostolic method, can be excused, perhaps, only when we take into\r\nconsideration the moral standards of the age and the motives of Charles\r\nthe Great. The best men of the time, however, like Alcuin vehemently\r\nopposed this method. After Charles had subjected the Saxons, he\r\nestablished among them eight bishoprics, Osnabrück, Münster, Minden,\r\nPaderborn, Verdun, Bremen, Hildesheim, and Halberstädt.\r\n\r\nThe Prussians, located to the north-eastward of the Saxons along the\r\nBaltic, stubbornly resisted efforts to Christianise them. Adelbert,\r\nBishop of Prague (997), and his successor, Bruno, were both massacred by\r\nthem. At length, a Cistercian monk, who was appointed the first bishop\r\nof Prussia in the twelfth century, made some headway among them, but was\r\nsoon compelled to withdraw. Then followed the crusade of the Teutonic\r\nOrder (1230-1280) in which the methods of Charles the Great were\r\nemployed and with the same results.\r\n\r\nChristianity was first introduced into Denmark in the sixth and seventh\r\ncenturies through raids on Ireland, commerce with Holland, and the story\r\nof the \"white Christ.\" Willibrord was the first missionary.[250:1] When\r\nhe was expelled from Friesland in 700 he went to Denmark, where he was\r\nreceived with favour by King Yngrin, organised a church, and bought\r\nthirty boys to be educated as missionaries. St. Sebaldus,[250:2] the son\r\nof a Danish king, was a product of this early missionary effort. Charles\r\nthe Great ruled part of Denmark, carried on extensive trade with the\r\npeople, located churches in Holstein and at Hamburg, and planned to\r\nconvert all the Danes.[250:3] Louis the Pious, appealed to by King\r\nHarold Klak[250:4] to settle a family feud, sent Archbishop Ebo of\r\nRheims and Bishop Halitgar of Cambray to Denmark in 822. Ebo made\r\nseveral journeys, later preached extensively, won many converts,\r\nbaptised them, and built a church at Welnau. When, in 826, King Harold\r\nKlak fled to the Emperor for aid, he, together with his whole family and\r\ntrain, was converted and baptised at Ingelheim. Upon returning, the King\r\ntook with him Ansgar, a Frank born at Amiens (800), who had been early\r\ntrained as a missionary teacher and preacher, and who was to win the\r\ntitle of \"Apostle of the North.\" He laboured in Denmark with some\r\nsuccess, but in 829 was expelled, when Harold Klak was once more driven\r\nout, and went to Sweden until he was elected bishop of Hamburg in 831\r\nwith all Scandinavia as his see. In 846, Bremen was united to Hamburg\r\nand Ansgar was made archbishop. He soon succeeded in planting\r\nChristianity and with it monasticism in Denmark. His successor,\r\nArchbishop Rimbert (865-888), continued the spread of Christianity\r\nundisturbed; and his successors Adalgar (888-909), Unni (909-936), and\r\nAdaldag (936-988), had a comparatively clear field. The last of these\r\nsaw the consecration of four native bishops, an increase in the\r\npossessions of the Church, and an organised struggle against heathenism.\r\nWhen the Danes made a conquest of England, the results were seen in the\r\nconversion of King Swen, a zealous worker for the Church, and his son\r\nCanute (1019-1035), who completed his father's work with the aid of\r\nEnglish missionaries. So strong was the Church in Denmark by the twelfth\r\ncentury that a separate archbishop was appointed. The supremacy of the\r\nRoman Church was recognised.\r\n\r\nThe conversion of the Northmen has an interesting history.[251:1] The\r\npolitical situation in the tenth century opened the way for the\r\nintroduction of Christianity. Hakon the Good, educated in England as a\r\nChristian, conquered and united all Norway, converted his followers,\r\ncalled over priests from England, and sought to force Christianity upon\r\nall his people, but in this failed. The sons of Eric, also Christianised\r\nin England, wrested the throne from Hakon the Good in 961, and likewise\r\ntried to uproot paganism, but they, too, were unsuccessful. Olaf, of\r\nromantic career, was called in 995 to rule. He, likewise, waged a\r\ncrusade in behalf of Christianity and with such success that when he\r\ndied in 1000, it had been permanently established. Olaf the Saint\r\n(1014-1030), however, completed the Christianisation of Norway and put\r\nit under the protection of the Archbishop of Bremen-Hamburg.[252:1]\r\n\r\nAs early as the eighth century, Culdee anchorites were accustomed to\r\nretire to Iceland from Scotland. In the ninth century Norwegians began\r\nto flee thither from the tyranny of their kings. Most of these emigrants\r\nwere pagans, but one Norwegian convert in Saxony persuaded Bishop\r\nFrederick to go with him to Iceland where the bishop remained four\r\nyears, but made little impression. Thougbrand journeyed thither in the\r\ntenth century, but likewise largely failed in his efforts. After the\r\nconversion of Norway, however, the intimate relations with Iceland soon\r\nproduced different results. Christianity spread so rapidly that in 1000\r\nthe Christian religion was made the state religion. The first church\r\nbuilt on the island was from timber sent by Olaf the Saint.[252:2]\r\n\r\nGreenland was discovered and colonised by the bold Icelander, Eric the\r\nRed, in 986, and Eric's son was sent over by Olaf to plant the Christian\r\nChurch there in 1000. The Church flourished there for four hundred years\r\nuntil disrupted by the Esquimos. About the year 1000 Vinland was\r\ndiscovered and thus the Gospel was known on the coast of New England\r\nfive centuries before Columbus appeared.[253:1]\r\n\r\nLike the Danes, the Swedes learned of Christianity through wars and\r\nconquests, and commercial relations. Björn, the Swedish King, asked\r\nLouis the Pious to send him Christian missionaries. Accordingly in 829\r\nAnsgar, expelled from Denmark, went to Sweden where he laboured two\r\nyears with some success. Five years later he sent Gautbert and Nithard\r\nto Sweden with a number of priests, but the pagan uprising killed all\r\nthe priests and soon swept away all traces of Christianity. In 848\r\nAnsgar made a pompous visit to Sweden again with costly presents and\r\nletters, and reopened the field for missionary work. By the eleventh\r\ncentury, the King of Sweden and his sons were baptised, and the work was\r\npushed with renewed vigour, although it was not until the middle of the\r\ntwelfth century that the conversion of Sweden was completed.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Charles the Great, the Slavs were located along the\r\neastern side of his Empire; the Wends along the Baltic Sea between the\r\nElba and the Vistula; the Poles along the Vistula; the Russians behind\r\nthe Poles; the Czechs in Bohemia; and the Bulgarians back of the Danube\r\nand Balkan Mountains. Charles the Great had attempted to force the Wends\r\nto accept Christianity, but with no success. Otto the Great conquered\r\nthem and likewise sought to convert them. He located bishoprics at\r\nHavelburg, Oldenburg, Meissen, Merseburg, and Zeitz, and an\r\narchbishopric at Magdeburg in 968 with Adalbert as the first archbishop.\r\nReaction began in the time of Otto II., under the leadership of\r\nMistiwoi, an apostate Christian, in which churches and monasteries were\r\nburned, and priests and monks killed (983).[254:1] Later, Gottschalk,\r\nhis grandson, an educated Christian monk, angered at the murder of his\r\nfather (1032), led an anti-Christian crusade, but was defeated and then\r\nrepented and ever after laboured hard to establish Christianity. The old\r\nbishoprics were restored and new ones created at Razzeburg and\r\nMecklenburg; five monasteries were built; missionary work was\r\nencouraged; the liturgy was translated into Slavic; and the Church in\r\nthat region became wealthy and powerful. But the heathen party, in a\r\ngeneral uprising, killed Gottschalk and his old teacher (1066),\r\ndestroyed the churches and monasteries, and once more slew the priests\r\nand monks. The final Christianisation of the Wends, therefore, did not\r\ntake place until the middle of the twelfth century.\r\n\r\nCharles the Great subjugated the Moravians, directed the Bishop of\r\nPassau to establish a mission among them, secured the conversion of\r\ntheir chief, Moymir, and founded the bishoprics of Olmütz and Nitra.\r\nLouis the German deposed Moymir on suspicion of treason and elevated\r\nRadislaw to power, but he soon turned against his benefactor and\r\ndefeated him, formed an independent Slavic kingdom on the eastern\r\nboundary of Germany, and sent for Greek missionaries, two of whom,\r\nCyrillus and Methodius, brothers and educated monks, were sent by the\r\nGreek Emperor Michael III. in 863.[254:2] Cyrillus understood the Slavic\r\ntongue and invented an alphabet and translated the liturgy into Slavic.\r\nHe preached and celebrated service in the language of the people, and\r\nhad a most able assistant in Methodius. They were very successful in\r\ntheir labours and built up a national Slavic Church. The German priests\r\nwho had been labouring there for some time were driven out, and with\r\nthem disappeared the Latin liturgy. Seeing their great success, Pope\r\nNicholas I., in 868, invited them to Rome and won them to a friendly\r\narrangement. There Cyrillus died in 869 but Methodius was returned as\r\nthe Roman Archbishop of Pannonia. The Pope agreed both to the use of\r\nSlavic in the mass and to the independence of the Slavic Church under\r\npapal control. Ten years later Methodius made a second visit to Rome and\r\na second agreement was entered into, satisfactory to both Rome and\r\nMoravia. He died before the ninth century ended, and before the close of\r\nthe tenth century the Latin Church had replaced the Slavic. The expelled\r\nSlavic priests fled to Bulgaria to build up a new Church.\r\n\r\nNeither Charles the Great, nor his son Louis, was able to conquer the\r\nBohemians. When Bohemia became a dependency of Moravia, however, the way\r\nwas opened for the introduction of Christianity. The Bohemian Duke\r\nBorziway and his family were converted, but reaction followed under\r\nBoleslav the Cruel. Otto I. in 950 completely defeated Boleslav,\r\nrecalled the priests, and rebuilt the churches. The bishopric of Prague\r\nwas established in 973, and under Archbishop Severus (1083) general laws\r\nwere enforced concerning Christian marriage, observance of the Sabbath,\r\nand morality. The Latin language and the Roman ritual prevailed in the\r\nBohemian Church.[255:1]\r\n\r\nThe first missionaries to Poland were Slavic, perhaps Cyrillus and\r\nMethodius. With the break-up of the Moravian kingdom, many nobles and\r\npriests fled to Poland and were kindly received. In 965 a Bohemian\r\nprincess married Duke Mieczyslav and took priests with her. The Duke was\r\nconverted and baptised and paganism was destroyed by force. The Church\r\nwas then organised on the Latin-German model, and German priests were\r\nintroduced. The first Polish bishopric was established at Posen subject\r\nto the Archbishop of Magdeburg. But it was to take many additional years\r\nbefore Roman Christianity was firmly established.\r\n\r\nThe Bulgarians, Slavic in institutions, but not in origin, captured\r\nAdrianople in 813 and carried away many Christian prisoners, among whom\r\nwas the bishop himself, who began the conversion of their captors. In\r\n861 a Bulgarian princess, returning from captivity in Constantinople as\r\na Christian missionary to her own people, converted her brother, the\r\nDuke Bogoris. This work was supplemented by Methodius, who was sent\r\nthere in 862 to help on the good work, and by other Greek missionaries\r\nwho followed him. In 865 the baptised Duke of Bulgaria wrote to Pope\r\nNicholas I. for Roman missionaries and asked one hundred and six\r\nquestions about Christian doctrines, morals, and ritual. The Pope sent\r\ntwo bishops and elaborate answers to the questions,[256:1] but the Greek\r\nfaith finally predominated.\r\n\r\nThe Magyars, who entered Europe in the ninth century and in 884 settled\r\nnear the mouth of the Danube, finally located in present Hungary. They\r\nfirst learned of Christianity at the Byzantine court. In Hungary,\r\nhowever, they came in touch with the Roman missionaries. Otto the Great\r\ncompelled them to receive missionaries from the Bishop of Passau. When\r\nPrince Geyza married a Christian princess, their conversion was rapid\r\nand complete. Adalbert of Prague visited the country and made a great\r\nimpression. King Stephanus (997) made Christianity the legal religion,\r\nenforced the German ecclesiastical system, formed ten bishoprics,\r\nlocated an archbishopric at Grau on the Danube, built churches, schools,\r\nand monasteries, and received a golden crown from Pope Sylvester II. in\r\n1000 as \"His Apostolic Majesty.\"[257:1]\r\n\r\nThe Russians claimed St. Andrew for their apostle but probably actually\r\nlearned of Christianity from Constantinople in the ninth century.\r\nPhotius, in 867, told the Pope that the Russians were already\r\nChristians. A church was built at Kieff on the Dnieper, the Russian\r\ncapital, and in 955 the grand-duchess, Olga, journeyed to Constantinople\r\nand was baptised. Grand-Duke Vladimir, the grandson of Olga, established\r\nChristianity at one sweep when he married Anne, the daughter of Emperor\r\nBasil and was baptised at his wedding in 988. Churches, schools, and\r\nmonasteries spread rapidly all over the country, but the Greek Church\r\ninstead of the Roman was firmly planted there, and in 1325, Moscow\r\nbecame the Russian Rome.[257:2]\r\n\r\nWhile the Roman Church was winning new subjects all over northern and\r\ncentral Europe; she was losing nearly as much in territory and numbers\r\nin Africa and Spain. This loss was due to the rise of a rival religion\r\nin Arabia which bid fair to outstrip Christianity in the race for world\r\nconquest.\r\n\r\nMohammedanism, shortly after its birth (622), began to threaten\r\nChristianity. After having driven the Christian Church from northern\r\nAfrica, the followers of Islam overthrew the Visigothic power in Spain\r\n(711) and then swarmed across the Pyrenees to overrun most of France.\r\nThe very existence of Christendom was at stake, and the future of Europe\r\nhung in the scales and might have been very different, had not Charles\r\nMartel with his stalwart Christian knights in the bloody battle of Tours\r\n(732) checked the advance of the crescent and forced its adherents to\r\nhastily retrace their steps. The califate founded at Cordova (756)\r\ncontinued as a standing menace for more than six centuries. Meanwhile\r\nMoslem corsairs scoured the Mediterranean, seized Sicily, and from that\r\nvantage point sought to make a conquest of Italy venturing at times to\r\nthe very gates of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe contest between the faithful of these two religions, continued for\r\ncenturies and attained its climax in the crusades. The followers of each\r\nfaith sought to either conquer or exterminate the other. This form of\r\nmissionary work was like that employed by Charles the Great against the\r\nSaxons and Otto the Great against the Slavs. The repeated assaults of\r\nFrankish rulers, Spanish princes, and Norman warriors in Italy were\r\nfinally successful and Islam was thrust back into Africa, but only to\r\nenter Europe by way of Constantinople.\r\n\r\nIn sharp contrast to these harsh methods, there are not a few instances\r\nof devout Christians labouring in love among the followers of the\r\nProphet to save their souls. Conversions to Christianity were not\r\ninfrequent in Spain, Italy, Egypt, and the East.[259:1] The Franciscans\r\nand Dominicans both laboured heroically among the followers of the\r\nProphet to teach them the higher and better faith.[259:2]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that Christianity spread so rapidly throughout\r\nthe Roman Empire, yet it must be remembered that more than twelve\r\ncenturies were to circle away before the cross was carried to all\r\nEuropean peoples and planted among them. The problem was as difficult as\r\nthat encountered to-day in Africa, Asia, and the islands of the seas. By\r\nthe twelfth century all Europe, except Lapland and Lithuania had been\r\nwon to Christianity. If the number of Christians approximated 30,000,000\r\nat the death of Constantine, the number at the time of Pope Innocent\r\nIII. in 1200 may have been 200,000,000 who came within the direct or\r\nindirect jurisdiction of the Christian Church. The sweeping control of\r\nthe Roman Church gathered under her broad ægis possibly 100,200,000.\r\nThrough these missionary activities, therefore, the successor of St.\r\nPeter had extended his actual sway until it included all of western and\r\ncentral Europe with a population as large as that of the Empire of Cæsar\r\nat the birth of Christ.\r\n\r\nThis unprecedented increase in dominion and subjects carried with it a\r\ncorresponding change in the power, duties, wealth, and opportunity of\r\nthe Papacy. The Pope of Rome became the greatest force in the West and\r\none of the greatest in the world. The hierarchy was necessarily\r\nextended and elaborated. The number of officers, both locally and in the\r\necclesiastical court at Rome, was greatly increased. The rapid addition\r\nof so many sturdy recruits to the Roman Church, carried on for\r\ncenturies, gave the Western Church a pronounced ascendency over the\r\nEastern Church. Papal prerogatives, which were little more than\r\nassertions in the early period, became realities. As a result of these\r\nheroic and persistent missionary efforts, the mediæval Church, at the\r\nend of the missionary period, had attained its highest power.\r\n\r\nA stream is coloured and influenced in its purity by the soil and rock\r\nthrough which it flows. An institution is modified by the peoples\r\nthrough whom it passes. It is not a matter of surprise to the historical\r\nstudent, in consequence, to see the Christian Church reflecting the\r\ncivilisation through which it grew. Christianity may easily be reduced\r\nto the fundamental Gospel principles taught by Jesus, but in that pure,\r\nsimple form it was not spread over the world and perpetuated.\r\nOriginating on Jewish soil, it never outgrew the Jewish tinge. During\r\nthe post-apostolic period it was powerfully modified by the classical\r\nphilosophy of Rome, Greece, and Alexandria. In post-Constantinian times\r\nthe multitudes of heathen converted to Christianity introduced heathen\r\nmodifications and compromises. The spread of the Church to Teutonic\r\nsoil, there to encounter a sturdy barbarism in most intimate relations,\r\nproduced modifying influences which can easily be seen in the history of\r\nthe Church. The Germanic contribution was to prove to be one of the most\r\nimportant and influential forces in the whole history of the Church,\r\nbecause it created, in a large sense, modern civilisation and the\r\nmodern Church.\r\n\r\nThis period of zealous missionary endeavour among the Celtic and\r\nTeutonic tribes was a great pioneer movement. Far too little attention\r\nhas been paid to it by historians and, consequently, comparatively small\r\ncredit has been granted to it as a force in the evolution of our\r\ninstitutions to-day. It is impossible to conceive what would have been\r\nthe history of Europe and the civilisation she has planted around the\r\nearth had not Christianity entered at this epoch to lay the foundations.\r\nEvery institution would have developed differently and the world would\r\ncertainly not be what it is to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nA.--PRIMARY:\r\n\r\n    I.

V.--Final separation.\r\n     VI.--Resemblances and differences between the two churches\r\n     VII.--Sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nRome conquered Greece by military force (146 B.C.); meanwhile Greece\r\nmade a more thorough conquest of Rome by ideas. While there were many\r\nsignificant differences in language, customs, education, and\r\ninstitutions, yet religiously they were united in a twofold way: (1) by\r\na common paganism, and (2) by Christianity. The East was philosophical,\r\ncontemplating, metaphysical, and keen in discrimination; the West was\r\npractical, legal, and aggressively conservative. This difference in\r\ntemperament was destined to have marked historical results.[265:1] While\r\nthe West produced the mediæval Church, the East remained comparatively\r\nstationary. When the seat of Roman empire was removed from the Eternal\r\nCity to Constantinople in 330, it appeared as if the eastern world had\r\nagain become triumphant.\r\n\r\nA divergence between the churches of the East and the churches of the\r\nWest, can be detected in the Christian philosophy and Christian theology\r\nfrom the beginning. The differences became more pronounced as the years\r\npassed by. The Arian Controversy (see Ch. IX.) produced the first crisis\r\nin the breach between Roman and Greek Christianity. The victory won by\r\nthe West over the East was only temporary, however, because in the end\r\nthe powerful state was arrayed on the side of the Eastern Church. The\r\nadoption of the \"filioque\" clause to the Nicene Creed by the Western\r\nChurch, gave mortal offence to the Greeks. The doctrine of purgatory was\r\nanother irreconcilable difference. Theoretically the Church was still\r\nunited: (1) in the Emperor who ruled both wings of the old Empire; (2)\r\nin the Pope who pretended to rule over the East and the West; and (3) in\r\nthe fundamental Christian principles. While there were still many\r\nresemblances, the differences were also becoming well marked in Church\r\npolity and organisation, in dogma, in rites and ceremonies, in\r\nmonasticism, and in missionary activity.\r\n\r\nAmong the matters in dispute was the growing differentiation of opinion\r\non the question of the marriage of the clergy. The Roman Church was much\r\nmore strict in the enforcement of celibacy. The two churches refused to\r\nagree on the same universal councils, and, of course, as a result,\r\naccepted an unequal number of canons as valid. Neither could they agree\r\non the proper day for celebrating Easter. There were also many minor\r\ndifferences in reference to such trivial things as the tonsure, the\r\nbeard, priestly garments, and Lent. Another stumbling-block was set up\r\nwhen the dispute arose over the sacramental bread in the eucharist. In\r\nthe ninth century the Western Church departed from the earlier practice\r\nof using fermented bread and insisted on the unleavened bread as in the\r\nJewish passover.\r\n\r\nThe second crisis in the separation arose in connection with the\r\nIconoclastic dispute. In the ancient religions, image worship appeared,\r\nbut usually in the second stage of development. Max Müller contends that\r\nin India \"the worship of idols is a secondary formation, a later\r\ndegradation of the more primitive worship.\" The ancient Persians had no\r\nimages.[267:1] The same was true of the ancient Greeks.[267:2] The\r\nearliest statue in Rome, that of Diana, was between 577 and 534\r\nB.C.[267:3] The old Germans had neither temples nor images of their\r\ninvisible gods.[267:4] Among the Jews, too, reference to images seemed\r\nto point to a later period of their history.[267:5] From the time of the\r\nMaccabees, however, a strong antipathy to images of all kinds\r\ndeveloped.[267:6] Hence Origen asserted of the Jews that \"there was no\r\nmaker of images among their citizens; neither painter, nor sculptor was\r\nin their state.\"[267:7] The Jewish Christians, therefore, were imbued\r\nwith a strong dislike to all images. Many heathen converts, likewise,\r\nfully appreciating the great difference between the Gospel and the\r\nidolatrous religion which they had forsaken, had the same feeling.\r\nConsequently, it may be said that the early Christians universally\r\ncondemned all heathen image worship and all customs connected with it.\r\nThe adoration of the reigning Emperors was especially denounced.[268:1]\r\nChristians were at first too poor and obscure to adorn their meeting\r\nplaces with art. In fact, the pagans accused them of having \"no altars,\r\nno temples, no known images.\"\r\n\r\nThere is evidence, however, that the use of images by the Christians\r\nbegan comparatively early and that it was more marked in the art-loving\r\nEast than in the West. Irenæus (2d cent.) says that a secret sect, the\r\nGnostics, \"possess images, some of them painted, and others formed of\r\ndifferent kinds of material. . . . They crown their images and set them\r\nup along with the images of the philosophers.\"[268:2] But these Gnostics\r\nwere heretics. Emperor Alexander Severus (222-235) had images of several\r\ncharacters of Scripture including Jesus, in his _Lararium_. But he was a\r\npagan. The catacombs of the second, third, and fourth centuries are\r\ncovered with paintings of sacred emblems, such as the lamb, olive\r\nbranch, Christ carrying the cross, anchor, ship, fish, sower, cross,\r\nChrist with the lost sheep on his shoulder, bottle of wine, and other\r\nrepresentations.[268:3] These emblems were used in the first instance in\r\nprivate houses. The first undisputed proof of the use of art in public\r\nworship among the orthodox is found in a decree of the Synod of Elvira,\r\nSpain, in 306, that \"pictures ought not to be placed on a church lest\r\nthat which is worshipped and adored be painted on walls.\"[268:4]\r\nTertullian (b. 150) says that the communion cup usually bore a\r\nrepresentation of the Good Shepherd.[269:1] He likewise says that the\r\nformation of the cross with the hand was very common. \"At every journey\r\nand movement, at every coming in and going out, at the putting on of our\r\nclothes and our shoes, at baths, at meals, at lighting of candles, at\r\ngoing to bed, at sitting down, whatever occupation employs us, we mark\r\nour forehead with the sign.\"[269:2] Clement of Alexandria early in the\r\nthird century mentions the dove, fish, ship, lyre and anchor as suitable\r\nemblems for Christian signet rings.[269:3] Constantine had the cross set\r\nup beside his own statue, in 312, after the defeat of Maxentius.[269:4]\r\nHe also had a costly cross in his palace[269:5] and had the emblem\r\nengraved on the arms of his soldiers.[269:6] Before the middle of the\r\nfourth century, Bible manuscripts were beautifully illuminated and\r\nillustrated. This evidence shows that the use of images in worship began\r\nin the second century and increased with the growth of the Church until\r\nby the fourth century it was a marked institution in Christendom. There\r\nwere three distinct phases of its development: (1) the use of the cross;\r\n(2) the employment of emblems and symbols; (3) the appearance of\r\nportraiture and pictorial images.\r\n\r\nThe growth of image worship from the fourth to the eighth centuries was\r\ndue to certain explainable causes. The victory of Christianity under\r\nConstantine brought a wholesale conversion of pagans to the new faith,\r\nwealth, power, and extraordinary activity in building churches. What was\r\nmore natural than that the architectural and artistic ideas of the day\r\nshould be employed in beautifying them? The Christian Emperor himself\r\nset the example of using sacred pictures by embellishing his new capital\r\nwith religious representations, such as Daniel in the Lion's Den and\r\nChrist as the Good Shepherd. Constantine's successors in showering their\r\nfavours upon the Christians, cultivated this practice. It must be\r\nremembered, too, that Christianity had become more material and worldly\r\nthan it was in the Apostolic Age. The conversion of the masses to\r\nChristianity was merely nominal and external. What was more natural than\r\nthat they should bring with them their pagan ideas and love for show and\r\nostentation, and that they should clamour for a material representation\r\nof their new faith?\r\n\r\nFollowing popular opinion and obeying private demands, the clergy\r\nthemselves became champions of the use of images. In the West, Pope\r\nGregory the Great gave his official sanction to the institution. Along\r\nwith the use of images grew up, out of the spiritual worship of saints\r\nand martyrs, the worship of their relics and their images, and\r\npilgrimages to the scenes of their labours. The ignorance and\r\nsuperstition of the period supplied an excellent atmosphere for this\r\nmarvellous evolution. It appears, then, that the Christian Church,\r\nplanted in the home of paganism, supported largely by converts from\r\npaganism, in a barbarous, credulous age such as that, naturally\r\ndeveloped and abused the use of art in worship.\r\n\r\nPoetry, music, painting, sculpture, and architecture all are\r\nunquestionably legitimate handmaids of religion and may be made most\r\nserviceable. But the use of images for ornament, instruction, and\r\nenjoyment is one thing; the worship of images is quite another thing.\r\nIn the Middle Ages only a few lofty souls here and there took the true\r\nview. Pictures were put into churches not as objects of art, but as aids\r\nand objects of worship. The pictures were reverently kissed, bows and\r\nprostrations were made before them, candles and lamps were used to\r\nilluminate them, and incense was burned to honour them.\r\n\r\nDuring this period, we have a number of excellent illustrations of image\r\nworship. Constantine used art to beautify his new capital in the East,\r\nand particularly to adorn his palace. Constantia, his sister, asked\r\nEusebius for an image of Jesus.[271:1] The veneration of the cross\r\nbecame especially pronounced after its adoption by Constantine, and it\r\nwas used in all religious ceremonies as an emblem of the victory of\r\nJesus over sin and the devil. According to Jerome the sign of the cross\r\nwas made, as it is to-day, in witness to written documents.[271:2]\r\nEmperor Julian (361) taunted the Christians thus: \"Ye worship the wood\r\nof the cross, making shadowy figures of it on the forehead, and painting\r\nit at the entrance to your houses.\" St. Chrysostom (b. 347) wrote:\r\n\r\n     The sign of universal execration, the sign of extremest\r\n     punishment, has now become the object of universal longing and\r\n     love. We see it everywhere triumphant. We find it in the\r\n     houses, on the roofs and the walls; in cities and villages; on\r\n     the markets, the great roads and in the deserts; on mountains\r\n     and in valleys; on the sea, on ships; on books and on weapons;\r\n     on wearing apparel; in the marriage chamber; at banquets; on\r\n     vessels of gold and silver; in pearls; in pictures on the\r\n     walls and on beds; on the bodies of brute animals that are\r\n     diseased; on the bodies of those pestered by evil spirits; in\r\n     the dances of those going to pleasure; in the associations of\r\n     those that mortify their bodies.[272:1]\r\n\r\nNilus, a disciple of Chrysostom, permitted the use of the cross and\r\npictoral Bible stories in the churches, but opposed images of Jesus and\r\nthe martyrs.\r\n\r\nChurches began to be decorated in the fourth century, and in the fifth\r\npaintings and mosaics were introduced. Constantine had \"symbols of the\r\nGood Shepherd\" placed in the forums of Constantinople.[272:2] The Holy\r\nGhost was commonly represented as a dove over the altar or the\r\nfont.[272:3] The Nestorian Controversy and the Eutychian discussion\r\nhelped to introduce pictures of the blessed Virgin and the Holy Child,\r\nJesus. St. Cyril advocated the use of images in the fifth century so\r\nclearly that he has been called the \"Father of image worship.\" By the\r\nfifth century, churches[272:4] and Church books, palaces and huts, and\r\ncemeteries were covered with images of Christ and the saints painted by\r\nthe monks, while representations of the martyrs, monks, and bishops were\r\nfound everywhere. Even pictures of the Trinity were in common use. In\r\nthe East, women decorated their dresses with personal images and\r\npictures, such as the marriage feast of Cana, the sick man who walked,\r\nthe blind man who saw, Magdalene at the feet of Jesus, and the\r\nresurrection of Lazarus. Portraits of Peter and Paul covered the walls\r\nat Rome. Ambrose, Jerome, Augustine, Epiphanius, Gregory the Great, and\r\nmany others of the Fathers, testified to the widespread employment of\r\nimages both for public and for private worship. The ceremony of kissing\r\nthe image, of burning incense to it, of bowing before it, and of praying\r\nto it, was gradually developed and became very marked in the sixth\r\ncentury. The climax, however, was reached in the eighth century when the\r\npaint was literally scraped off the images and put into wine to make it\r\nholier, and when the consecrated bread was laid upon the image for a\r\nspecial blessing.[273:1]\r\n\r\nWhen the portrait phase of image worship developed, pictures of\r\nmiraculous origin were produced and superstitious practices began to\r\nabound. Not a few pictures of sacred characters were attributed to Luke.\r\nOthers were described as \"the God-made images, which the hand of man\r\nwrought not.\" It was but a short step to attribute miracles and cures to\r\nthese images of divine origin.[273:2] To the wonder-working pictures was\r\nascribed motion, speech, and action. Out of such conditions direct\r\nidolatry could easily develop.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the educated concerning images differed very much from\r\nthat of the ignorant. The images were worshipped by the masses because\r\nit was believed that such worship drew down the saint into the image, an\r\nidea which came from the pagan belief concerning the statues of Jupiter\r\nand Mercury. Leontius, Bishop of Neapolis, near the end of the sixth\r\ncentury, said: \"The images are not our gods; but they are the\r\nrepresentations of Christ and his saints, which exist and are venerated\r\nin remembrance and in honour of these, and not as ornaments of the\r\nchurch.\"[273:3] To a hermit who asked for some pious symbols, Pope\r\nGregory the Great sent a picture of Jesus and images of the Virgin Mary,\r\nSt. Peter, and St. Paul, with this admonition:\r\n\r\n     I am well aware that thou desirest not the image of our\r\n     Saviour that thou mayest worship it as God, but to enkindle in\r\n     thee the love of Him whose image thou wouldst see. Neither do\r\n     we prostrate ourselves before an image as before a deity, but\r\n     we adore Him whom the image represents to our memory as born\r\n     or seated on the throne; and according to the representation,\r\n     the correspondent feelings of joyful elevation, or of painful\r\n     sympathy, are excited in our breasts.[274:1]\r\n\r\nImages were put into churches \"only to instruct the minds of the\r\nignorant.\" Again, he explained the use of images thus: \"It is one thing\r\nto worship a picture and another to learn from the language of a picture\r\nwhat that is which ought to be worshipped. What those who read learn by\r\nmeans of writing, that do the uneducated learn by looking at a\r\npicture.\"[274:2]\r\n\r\nThe most eloquent of all the apologists of images, John of Damascus,\r\ngave this explanation:\r\n\r\n     I am too poor to buy books and I have no leisure for reading.\r\n     I enter the church choked with the cares of the world. The\r\n     glowing colours attract my attention and delight my eyes like\r\n     a flowering meadow; and the glory of God steals imperceptibly\r\n     into my soul. I gaze on the fortitude of the martyr and the\r\n     crown with which he is rewarded, and the holy fire of\r\n     emulation kindles within me and I receive salvation.[274:3]\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that, however clearly the teachers of the Church\r\nmight see the difference between the right use of images to instruct the\r\nunlettered and to excite a spiritual feeling, on the one hand, and a\r\nsuperstitious worship of images, on the other, the ignorant masses did\r\nnot make the distinction in either thought or practice, and therein lay\r\nthe great abuse.\r\n\r\nFrom the death of Gregory the Great in 604 until the outbreak of the\r\nIconoclastic Controversy in 716, twenty-five Popes ruled in Rome. With\r\nseveral exceptions they were ecclesiastics of no historical importance.\r\nTo say that they lost nothing of the ground gained by Gregory the Great\r\nis to say much for them. But in addition they made some progress in the\r\nevolution of the mediæval Church. On this question of the use of images\r\nin worship they uniformly continued the policy of Gregory the Great.\r\n\r\nOpposition began as early as the use of images. Irenæus in the second\r\ncentury (167) denounced the practice.[275:1] Tertullian (192), quoting\r\nthe second of the Ten Commandments, severely denounced all use of images\r\nas sinful.[275:2] Clement of Alexandria (192) took the same view.[275:3]\r\nOrigen also based his opposition to the practice upon the Jewish\r\ninterpretation.[275:4] Minucius Felix (220) argued that man was the\r\nimage of God, hence there was no need of any artificial\r\nrepresentations.[275:5] Lactantius (303) held that since the spirit of\r\nGod could be seen everywhere, His image \"must always be\r\nsuperfluous.\"[275:6] Arnobius (303) took the same view.[275:7]\r\nChristians were told to carry God and His Son in their hearts and not\r\nto attempt to procure their images. The Spanish Synod of Elvira (306)\r\nexcluded images from the churches.[276:1] The early Fathers, taken\r\naltogether, looked with but little favour upon the misuse of images in\r\nworship. Eusebius, in replying to the request from Constantia for an\r\nimage of Christ, wrote a famous letter in opposition to the practice\r\nwhich virtually became the platform of the Iconoclastic party.[276:2]\r\nSt. Augustine (393) declared that \"It is unlawful to set up such an\r\nimage to God in a Christian temple.\"[276:3] Epiphanius (d. 402) with his\r\nown hands tore down a curtain which had an image on it in a little\r\nvillage church in Palestine. This seems to be the first act of\r\nIconoclasm.[276:4] Asterius (d. 410), Bishop in Pontus, opposed wearing\r\nBible pictures on clothing and told his people to wear the image of\r\nChrist in their hearts.[276:5] Xenius (end of sixth century), the\r\nMonophistic Bishop of Hierapolis, destroyed the images of the angels in\r\nhis church and hid those of Jesus.[276:6] In 518, the clergy of Antioch\r\ncomplained to the Patriarch of Constantinople that their Patriarch had\r\nmelted down the images of gold and silver hung over the font and the\r\naltar.[276:7] Serenus, Bishop of Marseilles, early in the seventh\r\ncentury, threw the images out of his churches. Pope Gregory the Great\r\npraised him for his zeal, but still justified the use of images.[276:8]\r\nThe Jews and the Mohammedans in the seventh century fiercely assailed\r\nthe Christian veneration of images as idolatry. This crystallised the\r\nIconoclastic elements of opposition into a party. Finally, in the eighth\r\ncentury, the secular head, Leo III., the Isaurian (716-741), championed\r\nthe Iconoclastic cause. His son, Constantine V. (741-775), carried it\r\nforward. The Synod of Constantinople in 754 officially condemned the use\r\nof images,[277:1] and this marks the climax of the movement.\r\n\r\nIt was not long now before there appeared in Christendom two distinct\r\nparties: (1) The Iconolatræ, or image worshippers, who were composed of\r\nthe leading churchmen like Germanus, Patriarch of Constantinople, and\r\nJohn of Damascus in the East; the monks, the common clergy, and the\r\nmasses of the common people in the East, and Pope Gregory II. and the\r\npowerful Church of the West. (2) The Iconoclasti, or image breakers, who\r\nincluded the Emperor and his civil officers; his army, made up mostly of\r\nbarbarians and Asiatic heretics[277:2]; a few churchmen like Anastasius,\r\nwho succeeded the deposed Germanus, actuated by political motives; and\r\nthe Carolingian rulers in the West.\r\n\r\nThe conflict was begun by Leo III., the Isaurian, a soldier of fortune,\r\nwho through ability as a warrior had won the imperial crown,--a powerful\r\nruler in falling Greece,--active, sincere, illiterate, honest, despotic,\r\nand unwise. Ambition to convert the Jews, Mohammedans, and Montanists\r\nmade him feel keenly the sting of their sarcastic attacks on\r\nimages.[277:3] One of his advisers, Beser, was a converted Mohammedan,\r\nwho had held numerous interviews with Islam leaders. As a zealous\r\nsupporter of the Catholic Church, Leo no doubt sincerely desired to\r\nrestore the primitive simplicity of Christian worship. As monarch and\r\npriest, he believed himself called upon by God to root out idolatry. He\r\nwas undoubtedly a noble puritan in his purposes and motives and called\r\nhimself a second Josiah.\r\n\r\nIn 726, he issued the first edict against images, authorising their\r\ndestruction[278:1] and the next year the exarch promulgated it in\r\nRavenna and the West. This was opposed by the patriarch, Germanus, and\r\nmost of the clergy; hence, it was enforced only in a few places where\r\nthe bishops supported the Emperor. The following incident will\r\nillustrate the popular indignation. Imperial officers were sent to\r\ndestroy a fine image of Jesus above the bronze gate of Constantinople,\r\nwhich the people regarded with unusual reverence. A ladder was put up\r\nand a soldier mounted it to take the figure down. A crowd of women\r\nwatching the act begged that the image might be given to them. Instead,\r\nthe soldier struck the figure in the face with a hatchet. The women were\r\nenraged, pulled down the ladder, and killed the soldier. The Emperor\r\nsent troops to quell the tumult and to carry off the image, and in its\r\nplace he had a cross set up with these words on it: \"The Emperor could\r\nnot suffer a dumb and lifeless figure of earthly materials, smeared over\r\nwith paint, to stand as a representative of Christ. He has, therefore,\r\nerected here the sign of the cross.\"[278:2]\r\n\r\nPope Gregory II., upon receipt of the edict, called a synod at Rome to\r\nconsider it (726). The synod condemned the Iconoclastic heresy and\r\nconfirmed the use of images.[279:1] In 727, the Pope wrote his first\r\nletter to the Emperor.[279:2] It was arrogant and dogmatic, without tact\r\nor persuasiveness. It was full of the most ludicrous historical\r\nblunders, and gave some fantastic interpretations of the Bible. In it,\r\nthe Pope justified the use of images, threatened the Emperor with the\r\npower of the West, and told him that his portrait, once honoured\r\nthroughout Italy, had been destroyed everywhere. In the second letter,\r\nthe Pope plainly told the Emperor: \"Doctrines are not the business of\r\nthe Emperor, but of the bishops.\" He declared furthermore that the whole\r\nworld was cursing the Emperor. \"The very children mock thee! Go into a\r\nschool and say 'I am an enemy of images'; the scholars will hurl their\r\ntablets at your head.\"[279:3] John of Damascus aimed two brilliant and\r\npowerful orations at the Emperor in which is found perhaps the best\r\ndefence of image worship. He declared that the pictures were the \"books\r\nof the unlearned.\"[279:4] The professors of the University at\r\nConstantinople declared their opposition to the edict.[279:5] The\r\ninhabitants of Greece used the edict as an occasion for rebellion to\r\nsecure fiscal and administrative reforms, and even went so far as to\r\nproclaim a rival Emperor.\r\n\r\nLeo met all this opposition firmly. The Patriarch Germanus was deposed\r\n(730) while Anastasius was put in his place, and the various outbreaks\r\nwere at once subdued with a strong hand. An effort was made to either\r\ncapture or kill the Pope. The University of Constantinople was closed\r\nand the professors arrested; the Greek rebels were defeated and their\r\nleaders beheaded; and an effort was made to stop the popular John of\r\nDamascus. Leo then promulgated his second edict in 730 for the complete\r\nabolition of image worship. Anastasius, the puppet patriarch, at once\r\ncountersigned the edict, and thus gave it ecclesiastical sanction. In\r\nthe East it was generally enforced. All images were removed from the\r\nchurches and burned; the painted walls were whitewashed over; only the\r\ncross and the crucifix were left; but still the Iconolatræ were far from\r\nbeing subdued. Meanwhile opposition in the West grew stronger. Gregory\r\nIII., the last Pontiff to be confirmed in his election by the Eastern\r\nEmperor, called a council and excommunicated all Iconoclasts.[280:1] In\r\nrevenge, Leo sent a fleet against the Pope, which was wrecked, and also\r\nextended the rule of the Patriarch of Constantinople over papal\r\nterritory in Greece and southern Italy. This action led the Pope to\r\nbegin negotiations with Charles Martel,[280:2] and that opened a new\r\nchapter in the rise of the mediæval Church and in the world's history.\r\n\r\nIn 741, Leo was succeeded by his son, Constantine V., only twenty-two\r\nyears of age, a ruler and general of ability, but of low tastes and vile\r\nhabits. He became a zealous persecutor of image worship, an idol of the\r\nIconoclasts, and won the victory for their party. His policy was to\r\ncontinue his father's work. Consequently in 754, he called a universal\r\ncouncil in Constantinople. Although it was the largest assembly ever\r\nheld up to that time, 338 bishops being present, yet neither the Pope,\r\nnor the patriarchs of Antioch, Alexandria, and Jerusalem sent\r\nrepresentatives. Hence, it was not recognised as œcumenical. The use\r\nof images and pictures was condemned as idolatry, and even the crucifix\r\nwas put under the ban. \"The godless art of painting\" was proscribed, and\r\nthe leaders of the image worshippers, Germanus, John of Damascus, and\r\nGeorge of Cyprus, were anathematised.[281:1] Backed up by these\r\nmeasures, the Emperor resolved to root out the evil for ever. All images\r\nwere ordered destroyed; all pictures were taken out of the Church books;\r\nall paintings on the church walls were removed; churches were decorated\r\nwith trees, fruits, and the chase; transgressors were cruelly punished;\r\nand the citizens of Constantinople had to take an oath never again to\r\nworship an image.[281:2]\r\n\r\nThe contest was renewed under Empress Irene (780-802), a young,\r\nbeautiful, ambitious, wicked Grecian, who favoured image worship. First,\r\nshe proclaimed toleration to both parties; then denied it to the\r\nIconoclasts. The highest civil dignities were given to the clergy and\r\nmonks; and the Patriarch of Constantinople became her prime minister. At\r\ntheir suggestion, no doubt, she called the Council of Nicæa in 787 to\r\nundo the work of the Council of Constantinople (754). There were present\r\n375 bishops, and Pope Hadrian sent two representatives, but the three\r\neastern patriarchs were unable to send proxies, so two eastern monks\r\nwere appointed to sit and vote for all the patriarchs.[282:1] The\r\ndecrees of the Council of Constantinople were nullified because\r\nheretical, and the Iconoclasts anathematised. Then image worship was\r\ndefined and authorised.[282:2] Many Iconoclastic bishops were induced to\r\nrenounce their heresy, and were freed from the ban. Finally, an image\r\nwas brought into the council and fervently and reverently kissed by all\r\npresent, after which the council adjourned.\r\n\r\nLeo the Armenian, who seized the throne in 813, was unfriendly to\r\nimages. He called a synod of Constantinople in 815 in which the acts of\r\nthe second Council of Nicæa (787) were nullified. He forbade the\r\nlighting of lamps and burning of incense before the images and had them\r\nelevated in the churches out of the reach of the people in order to\r\nprevent their worship. But Leo's widow, Theodora, restored the usages.\r\nThus, after a long, bitter struggle, images were finally restored in the\r\nchurches with great pomp and ceremony in 842. The \"Festival of\r\nOrthodoxy\" is still celebrated on February 19th in the Greek Church.\r\n\r\nAfter the great victory had been won for images, both the Latin and the\r\nGreek Churches continued their use. The puritanical Iconoclastic\r\nControversy was in a certain sense the forerunner of the ruthless\r\ndestruction of paintings and statues in England, Holland, and Germany\r\nduring the Reformation. The Council of Trent passed finally on the\r\ndoctrine and use of images in the Catholic Church.[282:3]\r\n\r\nAs a result of this controversy, the Eastern Church was greatly weakened\r\nthrough dissensions, checked in the growth of its organisation, robbed\r\nof its independence, made a mere tool of the state, reformed and\r\npurified even though image worship finally prevailed because it was\r\nbetter understood, and compelled to recognise the power of the Pope.\r\n\r\nThe Western Church, on the other hand, was forced to define the right\r\nand wrong use of images and was weakened somewhat by a schism like that\r\nin the Eastern Church, because the Frankish Church opposed the worship\r\nof images East and West. Pepin had the subject discussed in a synod near\r\nParis (767), in which sat legates from Rome and Constantinople. It was\r\ndecided that \"images of saints made up or painted for the ornament and\r\nbeauty of churches might be endured, so long as they were not worshipped\r\nin an idolatrous manner.\" Charles the Great, aided by Alcuin, published\r\nthe Caroline books denouncing all abuses in the worship of images,\r\nthough tolerating them for ornamentation and devotion.[283:1] The cross\r\nand relics, however, were commended (790).[283:2] The synod of\r\nFrankfort, held in 794, rejected the recommendations of the seventh\r\nœcumenical Council of Nicæa and condemned image worship.[283:3] A\r\nsynod of Paris in 827 renewed the action of 794.[283:4] These doctrines\r\nwere continued by Agobard of Lyons, Claudius, Bishop of Turin, the\r\nWaldenses in Piedmont, and the Lollards in England.[283:5]\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the controversy enabled the Pope of Rome to declare his\r\nuniversal supremacy in more sweeping terms than ever and to make it\r\ngood in the West. The rise of the Papacy, as the dominating force in the\r\nChurch of the West, made the rupture inevitable and permanent. The\r\nseries of protests in the East against the assumptions of the See of\r\nRome prevented any complete and absolute recognition of the supremacy of\r\nthe chair of St. Peter. As the years passed, the Eastern Church saw that\r\nindependence could be secured against the sweeping imperial claims of\r\nRome only by a declaration of total separation. The relations between\r\nthe East and West were likewise affected in another sense, because they\r\nwere separated politically when Charles the Great became Emperor of the\r\nWest (800), and were separated religiously when the allegiance of the\r\nPope was transferred from the eastern authority to the newly created\r\nwestern Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe growing estrangement between the Greek and Roman Churches, which had\r\nits origin in a fundamental difference in character, temperament, and\r\nideas, became conspicuous in the fourth century, reached an incurable\r\nstage in the ninth century, and culminated in the eleventh century. Pope\r\nNicholas I. in 863 deposed Photius from the office of Patriarch of\r\nConstantinople. Photius, in the counter synod held in 867, returned the\r\ncompliment by deposing the Pope for heresy and schism.[284:1]\r\n\r\nThe gulf between the East and West became practically irreparable when\r\nNicholas I., standing firmly on the Petrine theory and backed up by the\r\nPseudo-Isidorian Decretals, wrote to Emperor Michael:\r\n\r\n     You affirm that you and your predecessors have been accustomed\r\n     to command us and ours; we utterly deny it. . . . The Roman\r\n     Church encompasses and comprehends within herself, she being\r\n     in herself the universal church, the mirror and model of that\r\n     which she embraces within her bosom. Moreover, this vessel was\r\n     shown to Peter alone, and he alone was commanded to kill and\r\n     eat; as in like manner, after the resurrection, he alone of\r\n     all the apostles received the divine command to draw to the\r\n     shore the net full of fishes. And if unto us he committed that\r\n     identical commission--which is verily and indeed so\r\n     committed--to embrace in our paternal arms the whole flock of\r\n     Christ, is it to be believed that we surrender to you any one\r\n     of those sheep whom he hath given into our keeping?[285:1]\r\n\r\nIn 1054, the Pope excommunicated the patriarch and his whole Church for\r\ncensuring the faith of Rome. The courtesy was solemnly returned by\r\nConstantinople against the Roman Church. Other eastern patriarchs\r\nadhered to the See of Constantinople and the rupture was complete. The\r\nsack of Constantinople by Latin Christians in the fourth crusade\r\n(thirteenth century) widened the breach. At the Council of Lyons, 1274,\r\ndelegates of the Eastern Empire abjured the schism, by receiving the\r\nNicene Creed with \"filioque\" in it and by swearing to conform to the\r\nRoman faith and to accept the supremacy of the Pope, but the eastern\r\npatriarchs refused to do so. When, in 1439 at the Council of Florence,\r\nthe Eastern Emperor and churchmen signed a compact of reunion, they were\r\ninduced to acknowledge the Pope as the \"successor of Peter the chief of\r\nthe apostles, and the vicar of Christ, the head of the whole Church, and\r\nfather and teacher of all Christians, to whom plenary power was given\r\nby our Lord Jesus Christ to feed, rule, and govern the universal\r\nChurch.\" Other differences were patched up. The Pope, for his part,\r\nagreed to induce the rulers of the West to go to the defence of the East\r\nagainst the Turks, but failed to make his promise good. The people of\r\nthe East were sorely disappointed and forced the repudiation of the\r\nagreement. In 1453, however, Constantinople fell a prey to the\r\nMohammedan Turks, and the strength of the Eastern Church was broken. In\r\nmodern times, papal absolutism and eastern stagnation have prevented the\r\nreunion.[286:1]\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the differences and resemblances between the Greek and\r\nRoman Churches to-day might be stated. The Greek Church rejects the\r\nfilioque in the Latin creed; repudiates the immaculate conception of the\r\nVirgin Mary (1854), and denies the infallibility of the Roman Pope\r\n(1870). All the clergy are \"popes\" in the Greek Church and the lower\r\nclergy are permitted to marry. The Greek Church gives and the Roman\r\nChurch withholds the communion wine from the laity. The Greek Church\r\nuses leavened, and the Roman Church unleavened bread in the Eucharist.\r\nThe Greek Church holds to the trine immersion in baptism, repetition of\r\nHoly Unction in illness, and infant communion. There is a difference in\r\nrites of worship, in language, in art, in architecture, and in the\r\nvestments employed. But both hold the fundamentals in the Nicene Creed;\r\nboth accept all the doctrinal decrees of the seven œcumenical\r\ncouncils from 325 to 787; both practise image worship[286:2]; both\r\naccept the mediæval doctrine against which the Reformation protested;\r\nboth believe in tradition and the Bible; both believe in the seven\r\nsacraments; both teach transubstantiation; both offer masses for the\r\ndead and the living; both sanction priestly absolution; both have three\r\norders of ministry; both are episcopally organised on a hierarchical\r\nbasis; both have rites and ceremonies that are identical, or at least\r\nsimilar. All things considered, therefore, it seems that the\r\nresemblances are far more striking than the differences.\r\n\r\nFrom now on, interest in Church history centres in the Roman Church of\r\nwestern Europe. The undignified quarrel over images gave the Pope an\r\noccasion to declare his absolute independence of eastern imperial rule.\r\nThat fact gave a new bent to the Roman Church, forced upon it a more\r\ngenuine unity, compelled it to devote all its energies to the great\r\nproblems in the West, and enabled it to attain its acme under Innocent\r\nIII. in the thirteenth century. Had the unsatisfactory relationship with\r\nthe Eastern Church not been severed the history of the mediæval Church\r\nin western Europe would have been very different. The separation must be\r\nregarded, therefore, as a factor of no small moment in that process.\r\nWhile the effective missionary efforts, having their source and purpose\r\nin Rome, were winning all western Europe to a recognition of the Pope's\r\nsovereignty, it was very essential that he should completely accomplish\r\nhis independence of Constantinople so that he would have a free hand to\r\nwork out the problems of the Western Church.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nA.--PRIMARY:\r\n\r\n  1.--See Chapter IX.\r\n\r\n  2.--John of Damascus, _On Holy Images_, Transl. by M.

II.--Church\r\n     and state from Constantine to 476. III.--Period of the\r\n     Ostrogothic rule (476-532). IV.--Reunion of Italy with the\r\n     Eastern Empire. V.--Alliance between the Papacy and the\r\n     Franks. VI.--Restoration of the Empire in the West in 800.\r\n     VII.--Effect of the rise of national states on the Church.\r\n     VIII.--Sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the theory of the Roman constitution, the Emperor was not only an\r\nautocrat in all political matters, but was also the Pontifex Maximus of\r\nreligions[289:1]; consequently, all foreign religions must conform to\r\nthe constitution or else perish as illegal. The political philosophy of\r\nearly Christianity in reference to the Roman Empire was not very clearly\r\ndefined. Jesus taught charity and love, gave the Golden Rule as the law\r\nof life, but apparently was indifferent as to civil government. He took\r\nno part in political discussions; said \"My kingdom is not of this\r\nworld\"; disparaged worldly power and wealth, and advised the rich young\r\nman: \"Sell all thou hast and give it to the poor.\" He did recognise the\r\nduty of tribute to the state, however, saying \"Render unto Cæsar the\r\nthings that are Cæsar's,\" but did little more. The Apostles continued\r\nthe teachings of Jesus, emphasised equality and brotherhood; organised\r\nthe Church on a communistic, democratic basis; and were likewise\r\nindifferent to wealth and property. They too, recognised the state and\r\nits essential institutions. Slaves were told to obey their\r\nmasters.[290:1] Paul was very particular to explain the obligation of\r\nChristians to the state and said: \"Let every soul be subjected unto the\r\nhigher powers. For there is no power but of God.\"[290:2] He advised the\r\npayment of taxes as a just requisition.[290:3] And he himself, when\r\narrested for disturbing the peace, appealed to Rome.[290:4] Peter\r\nlikewise advised Christians to obey \"every ordinance of man for the\r\nLord's sake; whether it be to the king as supreme; or unto governors, as\r\nunto them that are sent by him.\"[290:5]\r\n\r\nThe early Church Fathers made no additions to the political science of\r\nJesus and his Apostles. Apparently no questions of seriously conflicting\r\nallegiance arose during the whole of the first century. As individuals\r\nthese early Christians no doubt performed all the duties and paid all\r\nthe contributions demanded by the Empire. From a strictly legal\r\nstandpoint, however, the Church was not incorporated among the\r\nrecognised cults, that is, it was not, like Judaism, a \"religio licita.\"\r\nNevertheless, it was not disturbed for some years.[290:6] Things must\r\nhave gone along, for the most part, in a customary manner. Pliny's\r\nletter to Trajan (about 111) describes the Christians in Bythinia as\r\nlaw-abiding. With the rapid territorial and numerical increase of\r\nChristianity, the state was forced to take cognisance of it and the\r\ninevitable conflict occurred. The Christians refused to conform to Roman\r\nworship and persecution resulted. Persecution in time produced, on the\r\npart of many Christians, a refusal to perform the duties of civil and\r\nmilitary service, but it cannot be proved that such hostility was\r\nuniversal. Indeed there is much evidence to show a general disposition\r\nto compromise with imperial demands.[291:1]\r\n\r\nWith respect to the general duty of obeying the law of the Empire the\r\nFathers of the ante-Constantine period were quite unanimous in their\r\napproval. In fact they boasted of their political loyalty and denied all\r\naccusations to the contrary. Justin Martyr said that \"wherever we are we\r\npay the taxes and the tribute imposed . . . as we were instructed to do\r\nby Him,\" and \"while we worship God alone in all other matters, we\r\ncheerfully submit ourselves to you, confessing you to be the kings and\r\nrulers of men.\" Irenæus asserted: \"we ought to obey powers and earthly\r\nauthorities, inasmuch as they are constituted not by the devil, but\r\nGod.\" These passages, and many others, which are undoubtedly typical,\r\nshow that it was the persuasion of the Church that conformity was a\r\ngeneral obligation. That this fealty was appreciated is seen in the fact\r\nthat the Church, at least in the time of Emperor Alexander Severus\r\n(222), was permitted to own lands, to erect churches, to elect officers\r\nopenly, and to send officials to court.[291:2] It was not, however,\r\nuntil 312 that these rights were legalised. One must never lose sight\r\nof the fact that it was both very easy and very natural for the clergy\r\nand the people to accommodate themselves to the new order of things, and\r\nto recognise in these new relationships a reproduction of the theocratic\r\nconstitution of God's subjects under the old covenant. Indeed it was\r\npractically impossible for the masses who came to march under the cross\r\nin those days to conceive of a Church without some relation to the\r\nstate. To-day to a modern man's eyes appears only the antagonism between\r\nthe Church and state.\r\n\r\nThere was a most striking contrast, from the standpoint of political\r\nscience, between the Roman and Christian religions. The Roman Emperor\r\nidentified religion with the state; Christianity separated God from\r\nCæsar. The Roman religion was restricted to earth; Christianity made the\r\nworld to come the most important part of life. The Roman religion was\r\nonly for Romans; Christianity was as wide as the world. Roman paganism\r\nfell and the Roman Empire perished, but Roman Christianity, clothed in\r\ntheir form, arose on their ruins to rule the world for more than a\r\nthousand years.[292:1]\r\n\r\nConstantine legalised Christianity, but thereby subjected it to the\r\nstate. He had no idea whatever of surrendering to it any of his\r\nautocratic prerogatives. He became virtually the Pontifex Maximus[292:2]\r\nof his new religion by controlling those who performed the sacred rites,\r\nand by defining its faith, discipline, organisation, policy, and\r\nprivileges. He enacted legislation for Christianity just as his\r\npredecessors had for paganism. The Church recognised its subjection to\r\nthe Emperor without a complaint and permitted him to appoint and depose\r\nits officers, to call and dismiss synods and councils, like Arles (314)\r\nand Nicæa (325), and almost to replace the Holy Ghost itself in\r\ndetermining the proceedings.[293:1] This marked a revolution in the\r\nrelation of the Church to the Empire, for each made a conquest of the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIt has been customary for Church historians quite generally to\r\ncharacterise the union of the Church and state under Constantine as an\r\nunmitigated curse that gave birth to a multitude of evils in the Church\r\nwhich led directly to the Reformation. That contention is one-sided and\r\nunfair. Whether the Church and state be regarded as both divine, or both\r\nhuman, or one human and the other divine, the historical fact remains\r\nthat their union was absolutely necessary and inevitable. When all the\r\nforces and factors of the time are carefully and duly considered, it is\r\nimpossible to conceive of any other solution of the problem in the\r\nfourth century.[293:2] That the union did paganise and materialise the\r\nChurch no one can deny,[293:3] but in compensation the Empire was\r\nChristianised and spiritualised. The resultant was mediæval Christianity\r\nand the ecclesiastical Empire. The Church, without the strength it\r\nreceived from the state, could not have met the barbarians of the North,\r\nthe Mohammedans of the South, and the heretics within, and successfully\r\nconquered the first, held the second in check, and subdued the third.\r\nMuch of what we enjoy to-day along the lines of culture, law, and\r\nreligion is due in great measure to that alliance. After the time of\r\nConstantine the Church becomes such a vital and integral part of the\r\nlife of Europe that history for a thousand years must be viewed through\r\nthe eyes of the Church and estimated by her standards.\r\n\r\nIn the two centuries which intervened between the time of Constantine\r\nand that of Justinian, imperial legislation directly affecting the\r\nChurch in all its institutions made rapid progress. The successors of\r\nConstantine continued his policy. Imperial sanction was necessary for\r\nthe validity of every important act in connection with the Church.\r\nCouncils were called and dismissed in the name of the sovereign, and\r\ntheir proceedings were not valid without his approval. At the Council of\r\nTyre (335), a portion of the bishops appealed to the Emperor's\r\ncommissioner to settle the dispute about the Arian question, but he\r\ndeclared that the question must be submitted to his imperial master for\r\nfinal decision since it was his province to legislate on all matters\r\nconcerning the Church.[294:1] Constantius vetoed a portion of the canons\r\nof Remini (360).[294:2] The Emperors Theodosius II. and Valentinian III.\r\nlikewise rebuked the Council of Ephesus (431), and dictated its\r\nprocedure.[294:3] The Council of Chalcedon (451) was also told to hurry\r\nup its work because the imperial commissioners present were needed in\r\nstate affairs.[294:4] During this period, however, it is possible to\r\ndetect pretensions on the part of the Bishop of Rome to the right to\r\ncall and preside over councils.[294:5] Here began the conflict over\r\necclesiastical sovereignty which was to end in a complete victory for\r\nthe Roman Church.\r\n\r\nThe later Emperors similarly exercised the right to decide all disputed\r\npoints of doctrine, discipline, and elections. They nominated, or at\r\nleast confirmed, the most influential metropolitans and patriarchs. Thus\r\nin 377, the Emperor's representative decided between two rival claimants\r\nto the apostolic see of Antioch.[295:1] Again, the Roman prefect decided\r\nbetween two rival claimants to the chair of St. Peter, Ursinus and\r\nDamasus, in favour of the latter, and punished adherents of the\r\nformer.[295:2] When rival Popes appealed to Honorius, he appointed a\r\ntemporary Pope until he could examine into the case. Then he decided in\r\nfavour of Boniface I. and issued an edict to prevent the recurrence of\r\nsuch a state of affairs.[295:3] The Emperor was the court of last appeal\r\nin all ecclesiastical cases. This was recognised by a council of Rome\r\nheld by Ambrose in 378, which requested of Emperor Gratian that when a\r\nRoman bishop was accused, he might always be tried by the imperial\r\ncouncil.[295:4] The best evidence, however, of the subordination of the\r\nspiritual to the temporal authority in this period is found in the\r\nlegislation. The whole field of Church government and ecclesiastical\r\nlife and all the relations, duties, morals, and acts of the clergy are\r\ncovered in the civil laws of the time. Even heresy was put to flight by\r\nimperial edict.[295:5]\r\n\r\nDuring the period of Ostrogothic rule in Italy from 476 to 552, the\r\nRoman Church made a few weak efforts to assert her independence. We\r\nfind, for instance, a Roman synod, held in 502, resolving that no layman\r\nhas a right to interfere in Church matters. But the Arian Ostrogothic\r\nrulers declared that they had succeeded to the Roman Empire's power over\r\nthe Church. Indeed the Theodosian Code was practically incorporated in\r\nthe Visigothic Code in 506 by Alaric II. Consequently, Odoacer issued a\r\ndecree forbidding the alienation of Church property. Theodoric in 498\r\ndecided between two rival claimants to the Papacy, Symmachus and\r\nLawrence, giving the former the papal chair and the latter a\r\nbishopric.[296:1] When a synod was called later to try Symmachus (501),\r\nit was convened in Theodoric's name. Theodoric even appointed a\r\n\"visitor\" to reform the abuses in the Church. He sent Pope John I. to\r\nthe eastern Emperor on an embassy, and on his return, dissatisfied with\r\nhis work, threw him into prison, where he died. Athalaric instructed\r\nPope John II. how to prevent simony in episcopal and papal\r\nelections.[296:2]\r\n\r\nUnder Justinian the Great (527-565), who by conquest reunited Italy with\r\nthe eastern Empire in 552, the Popes and the Western Church were again\r\nsubjected to the eastern rule. Like the Patriarch of Constantinople the\r\nPope was now the nominee of the Emperor and could be removed at the\r\npleasure of the prince. Sylverius, made Pope by the Arian Goth\r\nTheodatus, was therefore deposed and exiled by the Emperor's successful\r\ngeneral, Belisarius, and a new Pope was chosen. Vigillus, a favourite of\r\nthe Empress, installed as Pope by Belisarius (537), was peremptorily\r\nsummoned to Constantinople to answer for his conduct. There a synod was\r\ncalled, and he was excommunicated. His successor, Pelagius I., was\r\napparently appointed directly by the Emperor. Justinian, like\r\nConstantine, exercised the right to legislate for every phase of Church\r\nlife.[297:1] His theory was that \"human and divine authority,\" that is\r\ncivic and ecclesiastical law, \"combining in one and the same act,\"\r\nformed \"one true and perfect law for all.\"[297:2] He meant to exercise a\r\nspiritual power very much like the temporal power he wielded. Hence he\r\ninsisted that the election of a Pope in Rome by the clergy, senate, and\r\npeople should not be valid until confirmed by him. This practically\r\nreduced the Pope of Rome to the position of eastern bishops. The\r\norganisation of the Church was guarded and regulated.[297:3] The\r\nproperty of the Church was protected. The jurisdiction of the clergy was\r\nclearly defined and minutely regulated as an extension of civil power.\r\nIn all cases the Emperor was the court of final decision.\r\n\r\nThis arbitrary interference with the affairs of the Western Church by\r\nthe imperial authority at Constantinople brought the papal hierarchy to\r\nthe brink of ruin. The clergy were alarmed at this invasion of the\r\nsacred canons of the Council of Chalcedon, and the unity of the Western\r\nChurch, which had been so strong for several centuries, was seriously\r\nthreatened. The clergy of Gaul \"silently withdrew from, or boldly\r\nrenounced their communion with Rome; the Illyrian episcopacy prepared to\r\nfollow their example\"; and Africa became defiant.[298:1] Even the\r\nItalian provinces like Venetia and Liguria became disaffected. Pope\r\nPelagius I., indebted to the Emperor for his office, was forced to beg\r\nthe intervention of the secular arm to compel the ecclesiastical rebels\r\nto continue true to their allegiance to the See of Peter. Sorrowful\r\nindeed was this spectacle to those who could recall the palmy days of\r\nLeo the Great, Felix, Gelasius, and Hormisdas, who had imposed their\r\nwill on all ecclesiastics, had planted the banner of Roman supremacy in\r\nevery corner of Christendom, and had even imposed their laws on princes.\r\nBut it must be remembered that the theory on which Roman leadership\r\nrested had not been assailed, and was soon to reassert itself.\r\n\r\nIn the election of a Pope in 577, the Roman clergy resumed their\r\nindependence and ventured to consecrate and to inaugurate a successor\r\nwithout even waiting for imperial license. Hence Pelagius II. was the\r\nfirst independently elected Pontiff since the Byzantine conquest of\r\nItaly. He reasserted the universal primacy of the Bishop of Rome in a\r\nbold tone, and declared that anything done without papal authority was\r\nnull and void.[298:2] Meanwhile the disaffection in the West had given\r\nway to pronounced loyalty to Rome.\r\n\r\nEven Pope Gregory the Great did not question the supremacy of the\r\ntemporal power. He acknowledged the Emperor as his \"earthly master\" and\r\nsaid that God had given the ruler dominion even over the\r\npriesthood.[299:1] When Emperor Maurice renewed an old edict prohibiting\r\nmonasteries from receiving soldiers as monks (593), Gregory timidly\r\nobjected, but quieted his conscience by saying: \"What am I but a worm\r\nand dust thus to speak to my masters? . . . I have done what was my duty\r\nin every particular; I have obeyed the Emperor and have not hushed in\r\nsilence what I felt to be due to God.\"[299:2] He attempted, however to\r\ncarry out the spirit of the law.[299:3] But Gregory the Great was\r\nwilling to compromise the substantial prerogatives of his office. As the\r\nsubject of the Emperor, he could yield a point. As Pope he stood as firm\r\nas a rock, yet was too wise to provoke a disruption which could bring\r\nnothing but injury to the unity and power of the Church.\r\n\r\nPopes, like patriarchs, were required to keep an \"agent\" at the eastern\r\ncourt. The Emperors continued to insist on the right to confirm all\r\npapal elections, and, of course, this practically put the election into\r\ntheir hands, as is shown by the elevation of so many \"agents\" to the\r\npapal throne, viz., Vigillus, Pelagius I., Gregory the Great, Sabinian,\r\netc. The Popes, on their installation, were expected to pay tribute to\r\nthe eastern Emperor.[299:4] Even in questions of doctrine, the Emperor\r\nmight enforce his will by exiling an obstinate Pope, as in the case of\r\nMartin I. (655).\r\n\r\nDuring the period from 552 to 800, the papal power was growing stronger\r\nall the time, and only awaited a favourable opportunity to issue a\r\ndeclaration of independence. The Italians hated both the Greeks and\r\nLombards as foreign masters. Between the two stood the Pope as the only\r\nrepresentative of Italian nationality and the sole champion of Italian\r\nindependence. The Papacy was in theory democratic, and celibacy made a\r\ndynasty impossible. The occasion for a declaration of independence was\r\nthe Iconoclastic Controversy; the leaders were Gregory II. and Gregory\r\nIII., who formally excommunicated Emperor Leo and his hierarchy; and the\r\nnew ally to make the independence good was the family of Pepin in Gaul\r\nand Germany. After 772, the papal documents do not bear the name of the\r\neastern Emperor.[300:1]\r\n\r\nThe seventh and eighth centuries in European history reveal the elements\r\nof religious and political life in a state of incessant and violent\r\nfermentation. Sudden changes took place in the relative position of\r\nnations. The old Empire was disintegrating and new kingdoms were\r\nappearing. During this period of political transformation, the Church\r\nwas the only system that persisted in the old channel that it had\r\ncreated for itself. The Papacy, though not yet an acknowledged kingdom\r\nin the world, still stood among the political powers as a self-existent\r\norganisation, exercising an influence over princes and subjects. The\r\ngovernments were isolated, divided, anarchical. In the Church alone was\r\nthere unity, order, method, organisation, and supreme purpose. There\r\nalone was found facility of communication and cordial interchange of\r\nviews. The Popes of Rome kept up a constant intercourse with all nations\r\nfrom Asia to the Atlantic and constituted the one recognised unifying\r\nforce in Europe standing for the highest ideals of the age along all\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nUp to this period the See of Rome had gone far toward establishing an\r\necclesiastical monarchy. Every principle of an unlimited religious\r\nautocracy had been asserted and to a considerable extent established.\r\nThe outward machinery for this spiritual absolutism had been created and\r\npartially put in motion. But many obstacles to the smooth working of the\r\nsystem were still encountered. Chief among these impediments was the\r\nstrong arm of the eastern Empire. Until the fetters of political\r\ndependence were broken, the Papacy could never accomplish its great\r\nmission.\r\n\r\nHitherto the Church of Rome had assumed a political headship on many\r\noccasions, but it was the result of some accidental emergency and soon\r\ndisappeared. Nevertheless the experience gained in this exercise of\r\nsecular authority created an ambition on the part of the Roman Pontiffs\r\nfor political independence, furnished precedents for future claims, and\r\nled the Italians to believe that the head of the Church could give them\r\nefficient government in temporal affairs as well as spiritual. The great\r\nproblem before the successors of St. Peter at this time was how to\r\nmanage the ecclesiastical ascendency already gained over the Western\r\nChurch, so as to render it serviceable in securing that political\r\nself-existence so essential not only to maintain the ground already won\r\nbut also to realise their high hopes in other directions. At this\r\njuncture a combination of external causes, unparalleled in the world's\r\nhistory, came in to favour the emancipation of the Papacy from the last\r\nfeeble bonds of a nominal dependency and to permit of the assumption of\r\ntemporal sovereignty virtually if not in recognised title. This meant\r\nthe realisation of the mediæval Church.\r\n\r\nEmperor Leo's attempt to abolish the worship of images in Christendom\r\nprovoked a rebellion in Italy headed by the Pope. Luitprand, seeing his\r\nopportunity as King of the Lombards, fell on the exarchate as the\r\nchampion of images and on Rome as the supposed ally of the Emperor. The\r\nPope, perilously placed between a heretic and an invader, appealed for\r\nhelp to a Catholic chief across the Alps who had just saved Christendom\r\nby defeating the Mohammedans on the field of Poitiers. Gregory III.\r\nexcommunicated the eastern Emperor and begged Charles Martel to hasten\r\nto the succour of the Holy Church. Here the Roman Pontiff leads a\r\npolitical revolt against his legitimate sovereign and appeals to a\r\nforeign power to make the revolt successful. The Bishop of Rome has\r\nstepped into the position of a temporal prince with the political future\r\nof Italy in his hands.\r\n\r\nThe alliance of the Papacy with the Franks marks a new epoch not only in\r\nChurch history, but in the history of western Europe. These Franks\r\nsettled in northern France about 250, and began to Germanise the Celtic\r\nand Romanic races and institutions found there. But the current of Roman\r\ncivilisation was so strong that the Franks were swept into it before\r\nthey realised it. Under Clovis, they were converted directly to Roman\r\nChristianity.[302:1] With the aid of the Roman Christians, he was able\r\nto conquer the Arian princes of the western Goths, Burgundians, and\r\nBavarians. He and his successors gave the Church much property,\r\nacquiesced in the papal claims, and helped to extend the papal power\r\nthroughout the West, though they ruled the bishops and clergy as their\r\nvassals.[303:1] Clovis, himself, convoked synods and enacted Church\r\nlaws. Later rulers followed these precedents.[303:2] Thus the way was\r\nprepared for a successful alliance between the Frankish ruler and the\r\nPapacy.[303:3]\r\n\r\nThe house of Pepin was to play an important part in this new\r\narrangement. In 622, Pepin of Laudon, a zealous champion of\r\nChristianity, was made mayor of the palace in Austrasia. Pepin of\r\nHerstal, grandson of the first Pepin, became in 688 a mayor of the\r\npalace for all France (d. 714). He succeeded in making the office\r\nhereditary in his family. A series of infant kings[303:4] made the mayor\r\nvirtually king. Pepin viewed the Church as a powerful ally, and fostered\r\nmissionaries. Under him, twenty bishoprics were founded, and the Church\r\nsecured large territorial possessions.[303:5]\r\n\r\nCharles Martel, after a contest of four years, succeeded to his father's\r\noffice in 718. He ruled France with the hand of a master, Christianised\r\nthe Frisians on the north by force, aided Boniface, the apostle of the\r\nGermans, defeated the Saracens at the battle of Tours (732), and drove\r\nthem back into Spain.[303:6] On the death of Theodoric IV. (737),\r\nCharles ruled the Franks directly without setting up another puppet\r\nking. Pope Gregory III. in 739 sent him the keys of St. Peter's grave,\r\nwith the offer of the sovereignty of Rome and Italy in return for aid\r\nagainst the Lombards.[303:7] This proffered alliance was refused, but\r\nCharles offered to mediate between the Pope and the Lombards.[304:1] He\r\ndealt with Church endowments as with any other part of the royal domain.\r\nHe gave to his liege Milo the archbishoprics of Rheims and Treves, and\r\nto his nephew Hugh the archbishoprics of Rouen, Paris, and Bayeau with\r\nseveral abbeys. When he died in 741, \"he divided his kingdom between his\r\nsons\"--a proof that not only the office of mayor of the palace, but also\r\nthat of king, had become practically hereditary in his family; yet\r\nCharles Martel had never assumed the title of king.\r\n\r\nThe actual alliance of the Pope with the Franks was consummated with\r\nPepin the Short. The occasion for the compact was the Iconoclastic\r\nControversy in the East, and the change of dynasty in the West. Pepin\r\nthe Short accepted what Charles Martel had refused. He ruled Neustria,\r\nwhile Carloman, his brother, ruled Austrasia (741-747). When Carloman\r\nbecame a monk (747), Pepin was left as the sole ruler of all France, but\r\nstill under a phantom Merovingian king. In 751, with the consent of the\r\nFranks in their annual assembly, two churchmen were sent to Rome to ask\r\nPope Zacharias, acting in the capacity of an international arbiter,\r\nwhether the real king ought not to take the name of king. The Pope\r\nanswered in the affirmative, and thus authorised the usurpation.[304:2]\r\nThus a new prerogative of the Holy See came into active existence. The\r\nnext year the assembly of Soissons elected Pepin and his wife King and\r\nQueen of France. Childeric III., the Merovingian weakling, was shorn of\r\nboth his royal hair and his royal crown, and shut up in a monastery.\r\nBoniface in all probability then anointed the head appointed by the\r\nPope to wear the French crown.[305:1]\r\n\r\nThrough this alliance, the Pope expected to make the declaration of\r\nindependence from the eastern Empire good, to increase and extend papal\r\npower in the West, to establish a precedent for deposing and enthroning\r\nkings--a significant thing for the future,--and to gain material help\r\nagainst the Arian Lombards who were threatening Rome.[305:2] In 753,\r\nPope Stephen II., who succeeded Zacharias (752), fled to France from the\r\nLombards to implore aid from Pepin against them. In sack-cloth and\r\nashes, he threw himself at the King's feet and would not rise until his\r\npetition was granted.[305:3] The Pope himself now solemnly anointed\r\nPepin and his family with royal power, at St. Denis, and made him and\r\nhis two sons patricians of Rome.[305:4] After that Pepin called himself\r\n\"by the grace of God, King of the Franks.\"\r\n\r\nPepin repaid the Pope by making two excursions into Italy against the\r\nLombards. He took an army to Italy in 754, defeated the Pope's enemies,\r\nand compelled them to sign a treaty respecting the rights and territory\r\nof the Roman See, but the Franks had scarcely recrossed the Alps before\r\nthe promises were broken. Pepin, therefore, entered Italy a second time\r\n(755), called thither by the famous letter purporting to be from St.\r\nPeter himself.[306:1] The Lombard power was effectually broken. The\r\ntowns and lands of the exarchate and Romagna, claimed by both the\r\nLombards and the eastern Emperor, were given to the Pope.[306:2] This is\r\nthe famous \"Donation of Pepin\" by which his envoy laid the conquest of\r\ntwenty-two cities at the shrine of St. Peter, and thus began the\r\ntemporal power of the Pope.[306:3] The act of donation is lost.[306:4]\r\nThe Pope had owned tracts of land all over the Empire before, but now he\r\nbecomes through this gift a temporal sovereign over a large part of\r\nItaly known as the \"Patrimony of St. Peter,\" or the \"States of the\r\nChurch,\" which continued until 1870, when it was absorbed into the new\r\nkingdom of Italy. This act changed the whole later history of the\r\nPapacy[306:5] and provoked a long controversy with the secular powers of\r\nEurope. Pepin continued to labour to build up the Church in France by\r\nrestoring confiscated Church property,[306:6] by undertaking needed\r\nreforms in discipline and organisation,[306:7] and by giving material\r\nassistance and valuable relics to many religious foundations.\r\n\r\nThis alliance between the most powerful representative of the Germanic\r\nworld and the leader of Roman Christendom in the West was one of the\r\nmost eventful coalitions in the history of Europe.[307:1] It was the\r\nevent upon which all mediæval history turned. It created a new political\r\norganisation in western Europe with the Pope and German Emperor at the\r\nhead. For centuries, it affected every institution in western Europe.\r\nAfter Pepin, each new Pope sent a delegation with the key and flag of\r\nRome and the key of St. Peter's tomb to the Frankish rulers for\r\nconfirmation of the election and to give the king the oath of\r\nallegiance. Thus, the strongest western king assumed the same\r\nprerogative over the Church which the eastern Emperor had exercised.\r\nPepin's policy was followed by Charles the Great, the German Emperors,\r\nthe Austrian Emperors, Napoleon the Great, and Napoleon III.\r\n\r\nThe next important step in the relations between Church and state was\r\nthe restoration of the Roman Empire in the West in 800 by Charles the\r\nGreat,[307:2] the son of Pepin. Charles was born in 742, and received\r\nthe education of a warrior. At the age of twelve, he was anointed king,\r\nwith his father and brother, by Pope Stephen II. (754). As a boy, he\r\nparticipated in military expeditions and gained considerable renown for\r\nhis ability, his independence, and his prowess. When his father died in\r\n768, he ruled jointly with his brother Carloman, whom he apparently\r\nhated very bitterly, and with whom he quarrelled continually, until 771,\r\nwhen Carloman died and Charles assumed his rule as King of all the\r\nFranks.\r\n\r\nThe first problem which engaged his attention was to strengthen and\r\nextend his kingdom. This he accomplished by almost incessant military\r\nexpeditions, of which he made fifty-three. His domain was extended\r\nnorth, east, and south. The Bretons were subdued on the north; the\r\nSaxons on the east were conquered after cruelly murdering 4000\r\nprisoners, laying waste their land with fire and sword, and\r\ntransplanting 10,000 families elsewhere in Germany and in Gaul.[308:1]\r\nThe Slavs beyond the Saxons,[308:2] the Bavarians in the south-east, the\r\nSaracens and Basques in the south,[308:3] the Avars in Pannonia,[308:4]\r\nand the Lombards in Italy, were all subjugated. The result of this\r\nmilitary activity was that Charles ruled over France, nearly all of\r\nItaly, a large part of Germany, Holland and Belgium, and a corner of\r\nSpain. Then by shrewd marriage alliances, he cemented these conquests.\r\nHe married his dukes and counts to the princesses of powerful lords and\r\nkings, and he personally took as his wife, in turn, a Lombard, a\r\nSwabian, an east Frankish, an Alemannian princess, and even proposed\r\nmarriage to the eastern Empress. He assumed the crown of Lombardy in\r\n773. All parts of this vast realm were held together by a complete\r\nsystem of royal laws regulating the whole life of his people even in the\r\nminutest details.[308:5]\r\n\r\nCharles, as \"Patrician of Rome,\" was no less active in religious lines.\r\nHe inherited the alliance with the Papacy and continued it. He protected\r\nthe Church against the Saracens in Spain, the pagans to the north and\r\neast, the Arian Lombards in Italy, and the eastern Emperors. After\r\nfreeing the Papacy from the Lombards in 774, 781, and 799, he renewed\r\nthe \"Donation of Pepin\" and made some valuable additions.[309:1] He\r\nviewed the Pope, however, as merely the chief bishop in his realm. In\r\n796 Pope Leo III. sent him the key and flag of Rome and the key of St.\r\nPeter's tomb as tokens of submission; and three years later the same\r\nPope fled to Charles for safety and succour. He reformed and reorganised\r\nthe Church in his kingdom and made himself its real head. He carried on\r\nthe missionary labours of Boniface by converting the Saxons at the\r\nsword's point, and by forcing Christianity upon the Avars. He preached\r\nto the whole hierarchy, held Church councils, and even admonished the\r\nPope. He refused to champion the Pope's cause in the Iconoclastic\r\nControversy, but took a sane middle ground with a leaning toward\r\niconoclasm. In a council at Frankfort, he presided, and had the council\r\nlegislate on discipline and even on dogma (794).[309:2]\r\n\r\nThe career of Charles as Emperor of the Roman Empire in the West\r\n(800-814) must now be considered.[309:3]\r\n\r\nMany causes seemed to be operating to open up this new field for his\r\nmasterly ability. A woman, having put out the eyes of her son, was\r\nruling in the East, contrary to the Roman constitution. Charles had\r\ncarved out an Empire with his sword and was undisputed master of the\r\nWest. He was the recognised Emperor in power, if not in name. He had\r\nbecome the defender of the Church and the protector of the Pope. To\r\nassume the imperial crown was not nearly so radical or unnatural an\r\nact, then, as it might seem. In 799, when Pope Leo III. fled from the\r\nRoman mob to Charles at Paderborn, Charles gave him royal entertainment,\r\npromised aid, notified his Frankish diet of his intentions (Aug., 800),\r\ncrossed the Alps with an army, and entered Rome in joyous triumph (Nov.,\r\n800).[310:1] There he held a solemn synod in St. Peter's to investigate\r\nthe causes of the riot which had driven the Pope out, and also the\r\ncharges made against him. The Pontiff was freed of all guilt.[310:2]\r\n\r\nThe reward for Charles's friendly protection soon came. On Christmas\r\neve, 800, while he was kneeling in prayer before the altar of St. Peter,\r\nthe Church being crowded with the clergy, soldiers, and common people,\r\nthe Pope suddenly put a golden crown upon the king's head, while the\r\nRomans shouted: \"To Charles Augustus, crowned by God, great and pacific\r\nEmperor of the Romans, life and victory.\" The Pope then adored him as\r\nEmperor Augustus by bowing the knee as his first subject. The drama was\r\nconcluded by anointing Charles and his son Pepin with the sacred\r\noil.[310:3]\r\n\r\nWhether or not this was a surprise to Charles is a disputed question. He\r\npretended to be greatly surprised, even angered, at the Pope's trick,\r\nand declared that he would not have gone to Church had he known of\r\nit.[310:4] There seems to be little doubt about its being premeditated\r\nby the Pope. The probability is that no surprise was ever more carefully\r\nprearranged on both sides. It is easy to imagine the possibility of its\r\nbeing planned out at Paderborn over the wine cups and venison stews. It\r\nwas very clearly a fine piece of acting on the part of both the Pope and\r\nthe king. Certainly every act of the two men for some time previous\r\npointed directly and unmistakably to that result.[311:1] If we can\r\nbelieve Charles's own repeated assertions, the exact time and manner may\r\nhave been unknown to him, but for years, perhaps as early as 785,\r\nCharles had spoken of the possibility. Alcuin, the great confidant of\r\nCharles in educational and religious matters, knew of the plan before\r\n800. It had naturally often been suggested to the king by his own\r\nofficers and nobles and most likely urged by the Popes themselves.[311:2]\r\nIn fact the history of both the Frankish dynasty and the Papacy for some\r\nyears had been steadily tending to this result as a climax.\r\n\r\nThe coronation itself was significant for many reasons. Constitutionally\r\nit made the Pope and Charles traitors to the eastern Emperor. Charles\r\napparently realised this, and, again being a widower, proposed marrying\r\nIrene, the eastern Empress, in order to unite the two parts of the\r\nEmpire and thus avoid trouble.[311:3] But so frequently had the Pope and\r\nthe Romans broken their allegiance to the East, that this act was not\r\ngenerally viewed as a rebellion. Furthermore, they assumed that they\r\nstood upon the lofty ground of right in making the transfer. Henceforth,\r\nin the western lists of Emperors, Charles was made to follow Constantine\r\nVI. as the sixty-eighth successor of the first Roman Cæsar.[311:4] In\r\n812, the eastern Emperor was induced to recognise his western brother's\r\nimperial title. The old Roman Empire was now restored in the West on a\r\nGermanic rather than a Roman basis, a fact which revealed the new and\r\ndecisive Germanic element in the West. Both the Emperor and the Pope\r\nwere benefited beyond measurement by the change, and it is difficult to\r\nsay which the more. A Frankish ruler and his family had become the\r\nsuccessors of the Cæsars. The Pope assumed that he had created the\r\nEmperor and henceforth insisted upon the necessity of papal consecration\r\nto the validity of imperial power.[312:1] The Pope had received a\r\npowerful defender and a master who laboured unceasingly to build up the\r\nChurch. The foundation was laid for the two rival theories of the\r\nrelation of Church and state, viz., the papal theory and the imperial\r\ntheory. Henceforth, both Pope and Emperor have a new meaning and a\r\ndifferent career. A new chapter in mediæval history and in European\r\ncivilisation was introduced. Christmas 800 \"was the most important day\r\nfor the next thousand years of the world's history.\"[312:2]\r\n\r\nThe results of the rule of Charles as Emperor (800-814) will now be\r\nconsidered:\r\n\r\n1. _Religious._ As Emperor, Charles regarded himself, like the early\r\nCæsars, as the head of the Church. Hence he spent the winter of 800-801\r\nin settling religious affairs in Italy. He insisted on rigid obedience\r\nin the hierarchy and the subjection of all ecclesiastical authority to\r\nthe imperial will. \"The Church had to obey him, not he the Church.\" The\r\nPope was his chief bishop in his capital city, but always treated with\r\nfilial respect and consideration. The bishops were his sworn vassals,\r\nlike counts. The appellate power of Rome was never once used during his\r\nrule. He held the appointment of the higher clergy in his own hands,\r\nthough after 803, he permitted the appearance of a popular\r\nelection.[313:1] He issued edicts on Church matters with as much\r\nauthority as in purely secular affairs. In fact, in his laws the\r\npolitical and religious are so blended that they can hardly be\r\nseparated.[313:2] His conception of the relation of the Church and state\r\nhas played a vital part in the history of Europe down to the present\r\ntime. That relationship was stated by Charles in these words: \"It is my\r\nbounden duty, by the help of the divine compassion, everywhere to defend\r\noutwardly by arms the Holy Church of Christ against every attack of the\r\nheathen and every devastation caused by unbelievers, and inwardly to\r\ndefend it by the recognition of the general faith. But it is your duty,\r\nHoly Father, to raise your hands to God, as Moses did, and to support my\r\nmilitary services by your prayers.\"[313:3] It is very evident that in\r\nhis mind the old Roman idea of the relation of Church and Empire was\r\ndominant. The connection of Church and state, which Constantine founded,\r\nhe established on a firmer basis. The initiative and decision of all\r\necclesiastical cases were in his hands.[313:4] He called Church councils\r\nand presided over them just as he summoned his privy council. The\r\ncouncil of Arles (813) sent him its canons to be changed and ratified\r\nat will.[314:1] Discipline, faith, and doctrine all came within his\r\njurisdiction. He even put _filioque_ into the Nicene Creed against the\r\nPope's remonstrances (809).[314:2] In short, he organised, systematised,\r\nand controlled the Church in all its branches as a necessary part of his\r\ntheocracy.[314:3] He ruled as a David, or a Josiah rather than an\r\nAugustus or a Constantine. Churchmen of ability held seats in the civil\r\nassemblies and were given important political positions. The Church was\r\nforced to contribute soldiers and money to maintain the Empire,[314:4]\r\nalthough the clergy themselves in 801 were forbidden to participate in\r\nmilitary life. At the same time, he gave the Church for the first time\r\nthe legal right to collect tithes, bestowed rich gifts, and endowed\r\nmonasteries, splendid churches and cathedrals. No wonder a satirical\r\npriest complained that the power of Peter was confined to heaven, while\r\nthe Church militant was the property of the king of the Franks.\r\n\r\nThe Pope and clergy gladly acquiesced in the usurpation of Charles as\r\nthey did in that of Constantine and even gave him the papal title of\r\n\"Bishop of Bishops\" and \"David.\" The grateful Pope Adrian in a council\r\nof fifty-three bishops gave him the right to name successors for the\r\nHoly See.[314:5] This was little more, however, than the transference to\r\nCharles of a right exercised by all the eastern Emperors. Stephen IV.\r\ndecreed that no Pope could be elected save in the presence of imperial\r\ndelegates (815).[314:6] Pope Paschal III. had the great patron of the\r\nChurch canonised. Even the Patriarch of Jerusalem recognised him as the\r\nhead of Christendom and sent him the keys of the Holy Sepulchre on Mount\r\nCalvary and the flag of the city.[315:1]\r\n\r\n2. _Political._ Charles clearly differentiated between his office as\r\nking and as Emperor. In recognition of his new dignity, he laid aside\r\nhis German royal costume, and donned the Roman imperial tunic, chlamys,\r\nand sandals.[315:2] He ordered that \"every man in his whole realm be he\r\nclergyman or be he layman, shall renew to him as Emperor the vow of\r\nfidelity previously taken to him as king,\" and that \"those who have not\r\nyet taken the former vow, shall now do likewise, even down to boys\r\ntwelve years of age\" (802).[315:3] Rome was the capital of his Empire;\r\nAachen, of his German kingdom. He divided his Empire among his three\r\nsons as kings, but the death of two of them left Louis both king and\r\nEmperor.[315:4] The Empire which he carved out with the sword was now\r\nunified and ruled by imperial law instead of tradition and custom. His\r\nEmpire embraced all western continental Europe except central and\r\nsouthern Spain and southern Italy. It included Germans as well as\r\nRomans, Slavs, Celts, and Greeks, and was held together by an imperial\r\narmy.[315:5] It united the Teutonic civilisation with the Romanic on a\r\nChristian basis. It was divided into twenty-two archbishoprics.\r\n\r\nCharles, as the new Constantine of the West, was the absolute sovereign\r\nof this realm. His laws covered every detail in the whole life of his\r\npeople.[316:1] Bishops were forbidden to keep falcons; nuns must not\r\nwrite love letters; the kind of altar pieces used in Churches was\r\nspecified; priests were not to wear shoes in divine services. A pure\r\nlife was ordered for monks. Instructions were given to farmers for\r\nfeeding hens and roosters; the kind of apples to be grown was\r\nprescribed; wine-presses and not feet-presses were to be used. Even the\r\nprices of food and of clothes were regulated by law--a fur coat, it was\r\ndecreed, should sell for thirty shillings, a cloth coat for ten\r\nshillings.[316:2] The Empire was divided into districts and marks, ruled\r\nover by imperial \"missi\" and counts, who executed their master's\r\nwill.[316:3] Yet notwithstanding these magnificent and successful\r\nefforts to thwart the Teutonic tendencies to localisation, each tribe\r\nwas permitted to retain its own laws, its hereditary chiefs, and its\r\nfree popular assemblies of freemen.\r\n\r\nCharles never recognised the validity of the papal theory of the right\r\nof the Pope to crown and depose kings by virtue of his own coronation in\r\n800. When he associated his son Louis with him in rule (813), Louis\r\nentered the Church with the king's crown already upon his head. Charles\r\nthen ordered him to take the royal crown off and put on an imperial\r\ncrown which lay on the Church altar. Neither the Pope's presence nor his\r\nsanction was asked. After Charles's death, however, the Pope carried the\r\ncrown of Constantine to Germany and coronated Louis with it (816), and,\r\nbefore that time, his biographer does not call him Emperor.[317:1]\r\n\r\n3. _Educational._ The reign of Charles the Great stands out as the sun\r\nbetween the intellectual night that preceded and the daylight that\r\nfollowed his rule.[317:2] He employed the Church as the best means for\r\nfurthering the education of his Empire. The clergy and monks became the\r\nteachers and writers; the monasteries and churches were used as the\r\nseats of learning--the schoolrooms and schoolhouses. He issued important\r\neducational laws which practically created a very crude public school\r\nsystem and required all boys to have a general elementary education. His\r\npurpose was to make good Christians and good subjects.[317:3] The centre\r\nof his whole educational system was his famous \"Court School,\" the very\r\nheart of Christian culture in Europe. In it, called from every section,\r\nwere the leading scholars, divines, poets and historians of Europe. In\r\naddition to helping to educate the young princes of the country, they\r\nengaged in important literary activities. They compiled a German\r\ngrammar, collected old German songs and minstrels, corrected the Latin\r\nBible, wrote the Caroline books, collected manuscripts, revived the\r\nclassics, and studied the Church Fathers.[317:4]\r\n\r\nA careful analysis of the character of Charles the Great shows that he\r\nwas a sincere Christian and faithful churchgoer, a great almsgiver and\r\nvery kind to the poor, and a man who devoted his life to the upbuilding\r\nof a Christian civilisation.[318:1] Yet he was guilty of deeds which a\r\nhigher conception of Christian morals condemns as un-Christian. He\r\nsacrificed thousands of lives to his passions and ambitions; for thirty\r\nyears he waged a war of extermination against the Saxons and murdered\r\nmore than 4000 prisoners in cold blood. Like Mohammed, he made his\r\nmotto, submission to Christianity or death. Christians of that day, for\r\nthe most part, pronounced his policy right, although some of the\r\ngreatest, like Alcuin, denounced it. He had nine wives and concubines,\r\nand, like Henry VIII. of England, had little conscience in disposing of\r\nthem. He was not highly cultured, yet he spoke Latin with ease and knew\r\nsome Greek. When an old man, he learned to write and deserves great\r\ncredit for the manner in which he encouraged education. He cultivated\r\nthe society of the most cultured men in Europe and from them imbibed\r\nmuch. At meals he had read the heroic deeds of his ancestors, or some\r\nwork of the Church Fathers like Augustine's _City of God_. As a warrior\r\nand statesman, only Alexander the Great, Julius Cæsar, and Constantine\r\nbefore his day can be compared with him. He was the first and greatest\r\nof all the German Emperors. Since his time, only Otto the Great, Peter\r\nthe Great, Frederick the Great, and Napoleon the Great, have any claim\r\nto rank as his peers. The Moses of the Middle Ages, he left an indelible\r\nstamp of his genius on Germany and France, continues to be the only\r\ncommon hero of both of these great nations, and through them modified\r\nthe whole western world.[318:2]\r\n\r\nEight years before his death, Charles the Great made his three sons\r\nkings.[319:1] This act would have proved fatal to the Empire. Charles\r\nmust have known from the writings of Gregory of Tours, the dangers of\r\nsuch an arrangement. The division made among his sons was unnatural,\r\nbecause it lacked unity in race and territory, but the death of Charles\r\nand Pepin, the eldest and second sons, prevented imperial suicide.\r\nCharles the Great then solemnly crowned the surviving son, Louis, as\r\nEmperor in 813. Louis the Pious (814-840) sought to preserve both the\r\nCarolingian practice of division and the integrity of the Empire. At\r\nAachen, in 817, to prevent the Empire's being \"broken by man lest\r\nthereby a scandal, to the Holy Church might arise,\" Louis made his\r\neldest son, Lothair, co-Emperor, and, with the consent of the people,\r\ncrowned him.[319:2] The younger sons were made kings but _sub seniore\r\nfratre_. Their territorial districts were clearly defined and elaborate\r\ninstructions were given about their various relations.[319:3] In 819,\r\nLouis married again and soon a fourth son, Charles the Bald, appeared to\r\ncomplicate matters (823). Louis then made a new division of the Empire\r\nin order to provide for the new claimant.[319:4] A long list of\r\nterritorial changes, and disgraceful, ruinous, internecine wars\r\nresulted.\r\n\r\nLouis the Pious died in 840, and was succeeded by Lothair as sole\r\nEmperor. His brothers, Louis and Charles (Pepin was now dead), rebelled\r\nagainst him and forced him to restrict his possessions to Italy and a\r\nnarrow strip running from Italy to the North Sea (843). But Lothair,\r\ntired of the cares of this life retired to a monastery in 855 after\r\ndividing his imperial territory among his three sons.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the Carolingian policy of division, the Empire so\r\nskilfully constructed by Charles the Great, was almost destroyed.\r\nDivision of rule meant division of resources. The successors of Charles\r\nthe Great were men of inferior ability. His son, Louis the Pious, was a\r\nweak, easily influenced ruler and completely under the thumbs of the\r\nclergy. He made some noble efforts to reform the court, but only aroused\r\nthe enmity of the aristocracy. Lothair, Louis II., and Charles the Bald\r\nwere Emperors of as short-sighted a policy and of as little ability.\r\nCivil wars were almost incessant; nobles held in subjection by the great\r\nCharles reasserted their independence; the Northmen,[320:1] Slavs,\r\nHungarians[320:2] and Saracens began to make disastrous inroads;\r\nimperial laws were disregarded; and by the end of the ninth century, the\r\nEmpire of Charles the Great was little more than an empty title hardly\r\nworth fighting for.[320:3]\r\n\r\nAnother significant result of the decline of the Carolingian Empire was\r\nthe rise of modern states. By the treaty of Verdun in 843,[320:4] Louis\r\nthe German (d. 876) was given Germany east of the Rhine; Charles the\r\nBald (d. 877) received what is approximately France of to-day; and\r\nLothair as Emperor (d. 855) was left Italy and a narrow strip to the\r\nNorth Sea with the two capitals in it. To confirm the treaty of Verdun,\r\nLouis and Charles with their followers, took the famous Strassburg\r\noaths.[321:1] Louis and the French army took the oath in Latin; Charles\r\nand the Germans took it in German; and this is the first recognition in\r\nEurope of differences of race and language as a basis for political\r\naction.[321:2] The treaty of Meersen[321:3] in 870 completed the\r\nseparation of Italy, Germany, and France by dividing the \"strip of\r\ntrouble\" given to Lothair in 843. Here was the beginning of mediæval and\r\nmodern France, Germany, and Italy. The Carolingian Empire virtually\r\nended with Charles the Fat (888). Disintegration soon divided Europe\r\namong a multitude of petty feudal sovereigns with warring policies and\r\ninterests.[321:4]\r\n\r\nEcclesiastically, the Papacy was immediately strengthened. The supremacy\r\nof the state over the Church, which Charles the Great established and\r\nwhich Louis the Pious had inherited, but did not use to much\r\nadvantage,[321:5] was removed. This release from secular control\r\nfurnished an excellent occasion and opportunity for the rapid growth of\r\nthe papal theory which culminated in the lofty claim of Pope Nicholas I.\r\nto independence of imperial control and supremacy over it. Again and\r\nagain the Pope was called upon to act as arbitrator in the disputes and\r\nwars. The power of bishops and metropolitans was likewise increased and\r\nfor a similar reason, but the general decline in civilisation carried\r\nthe Church inevitably with it. The anarchy and confusion which resulted,\r\nformed an excellent cover for the promulgation of the Pseudo-Isidorian\r\nDecretals. Ultimately the Papacy was weakened by the decline of the\r\nEmpire and the rise of national states, because there was a tendency to\r\ncreate national churches and to set up kings who questioned the Pope's\r\nclaim to political supremacy. Indirectly it led to the Protestant\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nA.--PRIMARY:\r\n\r\n   1.--_New Testament._\r\n\r\n   2.--_New Testament Apocrypha._\r\n\r\n   3.--The Church Fathers.

It was the name\r\nof a rank, not of an office, and was next to that of Emperor and consul.\r\nHence it was usually conferred upon governors of the first class, and\r\neven upon barbarian chiefs whom the Emperor might wish to win. Thus,\r\nOdoacer, Theodoric, and Clovis had all received the title from the\r\neastern court. Later it was even given to Mohammedan princes. It was\r\nvery significant now that the Pope assumed the imperial right to confer\r\nit, because it was plainly an illegal usurpation.

Pope Stephen IV. at once caused the Romans to swear\r\nfealty to the Emperor and ordained that the consecration of the Pope\r\nmust take place in the presence of the imperial ambassadors. His son\r\nLothair was crowned Emperor in Rome and repeatedly repaired thither to\r\nprotect the Holy See. Another son, Louis, was also anointed king by Pope\r\nSergius in Rome. This act strengthened the papal claim to control\r\nelections to secular power. In 871 Louis II. acknowledged his divine\r\nright to imperial rule to be derived from papal sanction. Another step\r\nwas taken when the council of Aix-la-Chapelle deposed Emperor Lothair\r\n(842).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE PSEUDO-ISIDORIAN DECRETALS AND THE PAPAL CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n     OUTLINE: I.--What were the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals?\r\n     II.--Condition of Europe when the Decretals appeared.\r\n     III.--Purpose of the forgery.

VIII.--Decline of spirituality in the Church.\r\n     IX.--Sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals[326:1] were a curious collection of\r\ndocuments, both genuine and forged, which appeared in western Europe\r\nabout the middle of the ninth century under the name of Isidore\r\nMercator, to give the Church a definite, written constitution. They were\r\na stupendous forgery--the most audacious and pious fraud ever\r\nperpetrated in the history of the Church--worked out with admirable\r\nskill and consummate ingeniousness. Forgery was a common thing in those\r\ndays, and it was generally believed that all things which upheld the\r\ndoctrines and prerogatives of the Church of God were allowable.[326:2]\r\n\r\nWhen these false letters appeared, the Empire of Charles was falling to\r\npieces under his wrangling grandsons. Anarchy and confusion were\r\nrampant; might was the only recognised law. Feudalism with its\r\ndecentralising influences was rapidly prevailing throughout Europe. The\r\nChurch also reflected this sad state of affairs. The Pope was reduced to\r\na vassal of the Emperor. Metropolitans were in league with the political\r\nrulers and even helped to plunder the bishoprics and oppress the\r\npriests. The bishops were masterly secular princes and landed nobles;\r\nhence their persons had lost their sanctity, and they were persecuted by\r\ntheir archbishops and robbed by their sovereigns. The Bishop of Lyons\r\nwrote: \"No condition of man whether free or unfree is so insecure in the\r\npossession of his property as the priest. . . . Not only the estates of\r\nthe Church, but even the churches themselves are sold.\" The lower clergy\r\nsuffered from the tyranny and lawlessness of the day; the laity were\r\nsimilarly demoralised. The synod of Aachen in 836 protested against the\r\ncontempt into which the clergy had fallen with the ungodly laity. The\r\nage, too, was not critical. In fact, it was an impious thing to\r\ndisbelieve anything connected with the Bible, the Church, or with sacred\r\ntradition. It was an era of superstitions and legends. No period,\r\ntherefore could have been better adapted than that for the promulgation\r\nof such a magnificent system of fabrications.\r\n\r\nThere are divergent theories as to the purpose of these falsified\r\nepistles: (1) Some maintain that the sole object was to give the Church\r\na constitution of a definite form and character. (2) Others hold that\r\nthe intention was to present unquestionable proof of the papal theory of\r\nsupremacy by filling in the fatal gap between the time of Jesus and\r\nConstantine. It was dangerous to make the origin of the Church\r\ndependent upon an Emperor's fiat; hence, it was necessary to elevate\r\nthe See of Rome by clothing the Pope with antiquity, spiritual majesty,\r\nand supreme authority.[328:1] Venerable Rome was made to furnish the\r\nnecessary documents from St. Peter onward to supplement the Bible and\r\nthe Church Fathers with manufactured tradition. (3) Still others assert\r\nthat the object was to give the Church a general code of discipline in\r\nthe anarchy and confusion of the time.[328:2] (4) Most scholars believe,\r\nhowever, that the real motive was to free the bishops from their\r\ndependence upon the state, upon the metropolitans, and upon the\r\nprovincial synods which were under the control of the rulers.[328:3]\r\n\r\nThe motive for the publication of this code of decretals is thus stated\r\nby the authors themselves:\r\n\r\n     Many good Christians are reduced to silence, and compelled to\r\n     bear the sins of others against their own better knowledge,\r\n     because they are unprovided with documents by which they might\r\n     convince ecclesiastical judges of the truth of what they know\r\n     to be the law; seeing that though what they allege may be\r\n     altogether right, yet it is not heeded by the judges unless it\r\n     be confirmed by written documents, or by recorded decisions,\r\n     or made to appear in the course of some known judicial\r\n     proceeding.\r\n\r\nThe object of the compilation may be found also in these words:\r\n\r\n     We have likewise inserted the decretal epistles of certain\r\n     apostolic men--that is, of Clement, Anacletus, Evaristus, and\r\n     others who are their successors, indeed as many as we have\r\n     been able to find, down to Pope Sylvester; after these we\r\n     have annexed the rest of the decretals of the Roman prelates\r\n     down to Gregory the Great, together with certain epistles of\r\n     that pontiff; in all which, by virtue of the dignity of the\r\n     Apostolic See, resides an authority equal to that of the\r\n     councils; so that, the discipline of the ecclesiastical order\r\n     being thus by our labours reduced and digested into one body\r\n     of law, the holy bishops may be instructed in the entire \"rule\r\n     of the fathers\"; and thus obedient ministers and people may be\r\n     imbued with spiritual precedents, and be no longer deceived by\r\n     the practices of the wicked. For there are many who by reason\r\n     of their wickedness and cupidity bring accusations against the\r\n     priests of the Lord, to their great oppression and ruin.\r\n     Therefore the Holy Fathers did institute laws, which they\r\n     called holy canons, which, however, the evil-minded have often\r\n     made the instruments of unjust charges, or even possessed\r\n     themselves of the goods of the innocent.\r\n\r\nThe canons were insufficient to meet the evils of the day. Some remedy\r\nmust be found of equal if not greater authority. The decretals of the\r\nRoman Pontiffs were seized for this holy purpose. Many such decretals\r\nwere known to the Church. But there was a fatal hiatus of two centuries\r\nand a half after the founding of the See of Peter. That chasm must be\r\nbridged over by documents which would prove that the divine headship of\r\nPeter was consciously exercised by all his successors. With such\r\nindisputable evidence the supremacy of Rome would be established beyond\r\nquestion, and the entire hierarchy would be benefited. The ascendancy of\r\nthe Church over the state would be established. Papal sovereignty would\r\nbe acknowledged. Episcopal independence of secular control would be\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\nThe sources of the Isidorian Decretals, now satisfactorily determined,\r\nwere: the writings of the Church Fathers, particularly Rufinus (d. 410);\r\nthe works of Cassiodorus (b. 470); Jerome's Vulgate; the _Liber\r\nPontificales_; the general theological literature down to the ninth\r\ncentury; various collections of laws like _Breviarium Alaricianum_, the\r\n_Lex Visigothorum_, and the Frankish capitularies; the genuine archives\r\nof the Church like papal letters and decretals, Church canons, and\r\nminutes of Church councils; the correspondence of Archbishop Boniface\r\n(d. 754); and the forgeries.\r\n\r\nBefore this collection appeared there had been several others formed in\r\nthe Western Church:[330:1]\r\n\r\n1. Dionysius Exiguus, a Scythian, who lived at Rome as a monk in the\r\nsixth century, made a collection of the fifty Apostolic Canons; decrees\r\nof the Eastern and African Church councils from 375 to 451; and letters\r\nof Popes from 314 to 498. This collection was used by Charles the Great\r\nas a basis in part for the Frankish laws.\r\n\r\n2. Isidore of Seville, early in the seventh century, made a second\r\ncollection, very much like the first one just described.\r\n\r\n3. Then Isidore Mercator, about the middle of the ninth century put out\r\na third collection which embraced those by Exiguus and Isidore of\r\nSeville and included all the forgeries. This last collection opens with\r\na preface, then has a spurious letter from Aurelius to Damasus, and a\r\nforged answer; a selection from the fourth council of Toledo; a list of\r\ncouncils; and two spurious letters from Jerome to Damasus, with replies.\r\nAfter these documents the collection proper begins. It consists of three\r\nparts. The first includes the fifty Apostolic Canons; fifty-nine\r\nspurious decretals from Clement to Melchiades (90-314); a treatise _On\r\nthe Primitive Church and the Council of Nicæa_; and the spurious\r\n\"Donation of Constantine.\"[331:1] The second part opens with a genuine\r\nquotation from the Spanish collection of the decretals of the Greek,\r\nAfrican, Gallic, and Spanish councils down to 683. The third part also\r\nbegins with a quotation from the _Hispania_ and then gives the decretals\r\nof the Popes from Sylvester (d. 335) to Gregory II. (d. 731), of which\r\nthirty-five are forged and others contain many interpolations; and,\r\nfinally, the _Capitula Angilramni_.\r\n\r\nEvidences of fraud are to be found in the uniformity of language, the\r\nimpurity of style, the use of words of a late origin for an earlier\r\nperiod, many clumsy anachronisms, the total absence of all proof of the\r\nauthenticity of the early decretals, the evident effort to meet\r\ncontemporary prejudice, and the fact that there is no knowledge of the\r\nexistence of the forged letters until incorporated in this collection.\r\nMany absurdities also appear: for instance, Roman bishops of the second\r\nand third centuries write in Frankish Latin of the ninth century in the\r\nspirit of post-Nicene orthodoxy and about the mediæval relationship of\r\nthe Church and state. These early bishops quote the Vulgate of Jerome as\r\namended under Charles the Great. Pope Victor (202) writes a letter to\r\nBishop Theophilus of Alexandria (383) about a second-century\r\ncontroversy. Pope Anacletus speaks of patriarchs, metropolitans, and\r\nprimates long before they arose. Pope Melchiades, who died in 314,\r\nmentions the Nicene Council which was held in 325. Pope Zephyrinus (218)\r\nappeals to the laws of Christian Emperors before Constantine was born.\r\n\r\nJust how soon they were discovered to be forgeries, is a question that\r\nhas aroused considerable discussion. Pope Nicholas I. must have known\r\nthat they were false, but they suited his purpose so well that he\r\nsanctioned them. Some of the Latin bishops saw through the forgery, but,\r\nfor various reasons, kept silent. A few of the Frankish bishops\r\ndenounced them and objected to their reception as law. Even Hincmar,\r\nalthough he did so much to establish them, declared them to be spurious\r\nand called them a \"mouse-trap\" and a \"cup of poison with the brim\r\nbesmeared with honey.\" The synod of Rheims in 991 opposed the Isidorian\r\nprinciples. Stephen of Tournai (d. 1203) called them into question.\r\nPeter Comester in his _Historia Scholastica_ (twelfth century) granted\r\nthe ingeniousness of the author. Dante alluded to the fiction and\r\ngrumbled about the \"Donation of Constantine\" in these words:\r\n\r\n     Ah, Constantine! of how much ill the cause--\r\n     Not thy conversion, but those rich domains\r\n     That the first wealthy Pope received of thee.[332:1]\r\n\r\nNicholas of Cusa questioned their authenticity.[332:2] Chancellor Gerson\r\nof the University of Paris, boldly asserted that the Papacy was founded\r\non fraud.[332:3] Marsiglio of Padua[332:4] and Wiclif took the same\r\nview. Johannus Turrecrenta was skeptical about them.[332:5] Erasmus\r\npronounced against them. The authors of the _Magdeburg Centuries_\r\nconclusively proved in detail their fraudulent character. Calvin took\r\nthe same view,[333:1] and De Moulin and Le Conte helped to establish the\r\nfact of forgery. David Blondel, a Reformed divine, made the exposure\r\nunquestionable against the attempted vindication of the Jesuit, Torres.\r\nStill since it is so difficult to separate the true from the false,\r\ntheir influence was perpetuated beyond this period. It was not an easy\r\nthing for an infallible Church to abandon ground once assumed. The\r\nfruits of the forgery could not be surrendered. Catholic and Protestant\r\nhistorians alike now agree, however, that they were for the most part\r\nfictitious.\r\n\r\nThere has been a wide divergency of view as to the place, time, and\r\nauthorship. A few earlier scholars[333:2] held that they originated in\r\nRome. This is now rejected by all modern scholars, because their arrival\r\nin Rome is almost exactly known. One year Pope Nicholas I. is ignorant\r\nof them, the next he asserts their authenticity.[333:3] They were\r\nprobably carried to Rome by Rathod in 864.[333:4] Many contemporaries\r\nbelieved that they came from Spain as the work of Isidore of Seville,\r\nbut it is generally acknowledged now that they were created in the\r\nFrankish Empire because the language swarms with Gallicisms, the style,\r\nphrases, and words are of the Frankish period, and the frequent use of\r\nthe correspondence of Boniface shows that the archives of Mayence were\r\nconsulted. It is probable that the first collection was made at Mayence,\r\nand the later and larger collection may have been made at Rheims.\r\n\r\nIn matter of time, they seem to have been an evolution beginning with\r\nthe collection of Dionysius Exiguus in the sixth century, increased by\r\nIsidore of Seville in the seventh century, amplified by Isidore Mercator\r\n(Pseudo Isidore) with forgeries in the ninth century, and appeared in\r\ntheir final form in the eleventh century.[334:1] Their frequent\r\ncontradiction and disregard of well-known history suggests a composition\r\ncovering years. Some of the forgeries were undoubtedly used by Charles\r\nthe Great, and the Donation of Constantine is perhaps still\r\nolder.[334:2] Passages from the Council of Paris held in 829 are\r\nliterally quoted, hence the collection by Isidore Mercator must have\r\nbeen made after that date. On the other hand, the collection was used in\r\n857 by the French synod of Chiersy,[334:3] in 859 by Hincmar of Rheims,\r\nand in 865 by Pope Nicholas I.[334:4] The conclusion can be drawn, then,\r\nthat the collection of Isidore Mercator must have appeared sometime\r\nbetween 829 and 857. Furthermore, the frequent complaint about\r\necclesiastical disorders, the deposition of bishops without trial,\r\nfrivolous divorces, and frequent sacrilege, best fit the period of civil\r\nwar and confusion among the grandsons of Charles the Great.\r\n\r\nThere is likewise divergence of opinion as to the authorship. The name\r\nof the compiler, Isidore Mercator, led to the early erroneous belief\r\nthat Isidore of Seville, the eminent canonist, was the author; and,\r\nconsequently, when the mistake was established, the author was dubbed\r\n\"Pseudo Isidore,\" a name used to the present day. Scholars differ widely\r\nin their efforts to identify this \"Pseudo Isidore\" and suggest\r\nBenedictus Levita, a deacon of Mayence, whose _capitularium_ of 847\r\nagrees in certain passages with the decretals[335:1]; Rathod of\r\nSoissons[335:2]; Otgar, Archbishop of Mayence (d. 847), who led the\r\nclerical rebellion against Louis the Pious[335:3]; Ebo, Archbishop of\r\nRheims, also a clerical rebel against the Emperor[335:4];\r\nRiculfus,[335:5] Archbishop of Mayence (784-814); and Aldrich.[335:6]\r\nThe authorship, it is apparent, is not established beyond question.\r\nIndeed there are many reasons for believing that these documents were\r\nthe product not of a single individual, but of a joint effort. The\r\nconstant repetitions, the frequent contradictions, the lack of unity,\r\nthe differences in style and phrases suggest this conclusion. It is\r\nquite probable that the leading churchmen in Germany and France in the\r\nmiddle of the ninth century shared the authorship.[335:7] Gieseler holds\r\nthat Riculfus (784-814) brought the genuine Isidorian collections from\r\nSpain, that Otgar enlarged and corrupted them at Mayence (826-847), that\r\nBenedictus Levita copied them; and this may have been the case.\r\n\r\nThey were eagerly received by the Church, and for various reasons Pope\r\nNicholas I. (853-867) gave them papal sanction and used them to extend\r\nhis power. He led the Church to believe that they were among the most\r\nvenerable and carefully preserved documents of the papal archives.\r\nBacked up by them, he asserted his jurisdiction over both East and West;\r\nin fact, the whole world. To the eastern Emperor he wrote, \"We by the\r\npower committed to us by our Lord through St. Peter, restore our brother\r\nIgnatius to his former station, to his see [at Constantinople], to his\r\ndignity as patriarch and to all the honours of his office.\"[336:1] At\r\nthe same time he exalted the power of excommunication and used it to\r\nhumble both princes and prelates; he forced Lothair II. to restore his\r\ndivorced wife; he humbled the great Hincmar by reinstating the deposed\r\nBishop Rathod of Soissons; he subjected both metropolitans and bishops\r\nto his rule; he deposed the archbishops of Cologne and Trier and made\r\nthe Pope ubiquitous through the system of legates. Well could the old\r\nchronicler say: \"Since the days of Gregory I. to our own time, sat no\r\nhigh priest on the throne of St. Peter to be compared to Nicholas. He\r\ntamed kings and tyrants, and ruled the world like a sovereign. To holy\r\nbishops and the clergy he was mild and gentle; to the wicked and\r\nunconverted a terror, so that we might truly say a new Elias arose in\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n     It is evident [wrote the great forerunner of Hildebrand] that\r\n     Popes can neither be bound nor unbound by any earthly power,\r\n     nor even by that of the Apostle if he were to return upon\r\n     earth; since Constantine the Great has recognised that the\r\n     pontiffs held the place of God on earth, the Divinity not\r\n     being able to be judged by any man living. We are then\r\n     infallable and whatever may be our acts, we are not\r\n     accountable for them but to ourselves.[336:2]\r\n\r\nThis is generally held to be spurious now, but the spirit of it may be\r\nsaid to be true. The archbishops eagerly accepted the decretals because\r\nthey hoped to profit by their doctrines. Instead, however, through them\r\nthey were subjected to the Pope and largely lost their independence.\r\nThey were gladly received by the bishops, since by them they hoped to\r\ngain independence both of the tyrannical metropolitans and of the state.\r\nThey were welcomed by the lower clergy and laity in general without a\r\nquestion because they came from a source so high in authority as the\r\nPope and the bishops.\r\n\r\nThese forged decretals gave the Papacy a definite constitution; the\r\nPetrine theory was now proved by indisputable historical evidence--the\r\nideal Papacy was made a fact from the very first. In fact the charge\r\ngiven by Peter to Clement, when the primate Apostle transmitted his\r\npower to a successor, is found in very characteristic language. The\r\npowers and relations of the whole dogmatic hierarchy from top to bottom\r\nwere defined. The Popes from St. Peter on were made the parents and\r\nguardians of the faith of the world, and the legislators for it, and\r\nalso the supreme judges in all cases of justice. In short this\r\nconstitution logically completed the Petrine theory. The metropolitans\r\nwere curtailed in their prerogatives and subjected to the Pope.\r\nMetropolitan courts were reduced to committees of inquiry. All original\r\njurisdiction in ecclesiastical causes was transferred to Rome. No\r\nmetropolitan could call a synod now without the Pope's consent. The\r\nmetropolitans' power over the bishops was greatly decreased and they\r\nwere separated from the Pope by newly created primates. The bishops, in\r\ntheir turn, as ambassadors of God were made independent of both the\r\nstate and the metropolitans, but subjected to the Pope. Peter and the\r\nother Apostles furnished the example for this arrangement. All episcopal\r\ncases were taken out of secular courts[337:1]; all secular cases could\r\nbe carried to episcopal courts[338:1]; all laymen as well as lower\r\nclergy were excluded from episcopal synods. Bishops were made\r\npractically immune by the great difficulty of bringing accusations. In\r\nthe trial of a bishop, the accuser had to have seventy-two duly\r\nqualified witnesses and if he failed to prove his case he and not the\r\nbishop was liable to punishment. At any time the bishop could break off\r\nproceedings by appealing the case directly to the Pope. The priesthood\r\nwas definitely separated from the laity as the _familiares Dei_. They\r\nwere the _spiritales_; the laity the _carnales_.[338:2] Priests were\r\nalso freed from secular control and placed above it. They, in like\r\nmanner, enjoyed certain immunities which made it no easy matter to\r\nproceed against them.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the relations of Church and state were defined more\r\nclearly. Ecclesiastical power was now held to be supreme over secular\r\npower and that change was a pronounced revolution. \"All the rulers of\r\nearth,\" it was dogmatically affirmed, \"are bound to obey the bishop and\r\nto bow the neck before him.\"[338:3] Imperial control of the Church,\r\nexercised for eight centuries, was declared to be a usurpation which\r\nentailed disputes and wars. The state was represented as unholy, the\r\nChurch as holy. That proposition struck the sword of justice out of the\r\nhand of the temporal prince and removed the clergy from the reach of the\r\nsecular law. Clergy were freed from political courts and the laymen were\r\nexcluded, in theory at least, from participation in Church legislation.\r\nIn short these decretals carried the papal theocracy far beyond any\r\nclaims made up to that time by the Popes themselves. It was left to\r\nGregory VII. and Innocent III. to make the claim a living reality.\r\n\r\nThese decretals formed a part of the _Corpus Juris Canonici_ for six\r\nhundred years and supplied a complete set of laws concerning Church\r\nlands, usurpation and spoliation, ordinations, sacraments, fasts,\r\nfestivals, relics of the cross and of the Apostles, schism and heresy,\r\nthe use of holy water and the chrism, the consecration of churches, the\r\nblessing of the fruits of the field, sacred vessels, garments, etc. In\r\nthis way society was influenced and modified in all its ramifications.\r\nBoth the civil and ecclesiastical polity of Europe was affected for\r\ncenturies to follow. Over and over again they were quoted to prove papal\r\nomnipotence against temporal authority. For the purpose of illustration,\r\nthe decretals were replete with personal incidents and had in them many\r\nbeautiful axioms of sincere and vital religious truth. The whole tone of\r\nthe composition was pious and reverential. Pope, bishop, and lower\r\nclergy all gained by this shrewd and specious defence of the Papacy. The\r\npriesthood actually constituted the Church.\r\n\r\nIn this period of ignorance and lawlessness, while the Empire\r\nestablished by Charles the Great was disintegrating, the Papacy rapidly\r\nforged to the front as the champion of united Christendom; and to this\r\nend the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals contributed powerfully. How much was\r\ncontributed that was actually new may be a question. Whether the history\r\nof the Church would have been the same had they not appeared is a\r\ndisputed point. Whether the Pope without them could have become the\r\ngreatest ruler of western Europe by the middle of the ninth century is\r\nnot clear. Whether the Papacy would have had a world-wide political\r\ninterest from this time on without them is a question still unsettled.\r\n\r\nNothing better illustrates the immediate fruits of the Pseudo-Isidorian\r\nDecretals than the pontificate of Nicholas I. In the year 858 he was\r\nunanimously chosen Pope by the Emperor, and the clergy and people of\r\nRome. He had been the friend and minister of Sergius II. and Leo IV.\r\namid all their dangers and difficulties. His trying experiences\r\nqualified him for the responsible office. His personal qualities had won\r\nhim many friends. Consequently there was general rejoicing when, in the\r\npresence of the Emperor and the Romans, he was inaugurated. Three days\r\nafter the solemnity, the Emperor Louis II. entertained Pope Nicholas I.\r\nat a state-banquet and then withdrew a short distance from the city\r\nwalls to receive the return-visit on the following day. As the Pope,\r\nescorted by the clergy and nobility, approached the imperial camp, Louis\r\nmet him, dismounted from his horse, and conducted the Pope's palfrey the\r\nlength of a bow-shot, after the ordinary custom of a bridle-groom. A\r\nsumptuous feast was then served in the imperial tents, and the Emperor\r\nagain escorted Nicholas a like distance on his return. The Pontiff, on\r\nparting, descended from his horse, embraced Louis, and kissed him. \"And\r\nthus,\" says the chronicler, \"they lovingly took leave of each other.\"\r\n\r\nThis imperial self-humiliation had beneath it a purpose. Louis II. hoped\r\nto extend his dominion beyond the borders of Italy, to which his\r\nbrothers had reduced him, and desired the assistance of Rome. Nicholas\r\nI. was not averse to meddling in worldly affairs. Backed up by the false\r\ndecretals, with precedents created by his sainted predecessors, with\r\npolitical confusion and secular wrangling as his ally, with his own\r\nboldness and clear intellect as his guides, he plunged into mundane\r\naffairs without hesitation. Ability and opportunity won for him one\r\nsuccess after another. The first conquest he made was in humiliating the\r\nItalian primates of Milan, Aquileia, and Ravenna, and in making the\r\nItalian clergy directly dependent upon Rome. Emperor Louis II. was\r\nforced to bow to papal authority in this matter, although hitherto the\r\ncreation of new bishoprics had rested with the temporal lord.\r\n\r\nAgain when the bishopric of Hamburg was destroyed by the Normans, King\r\nLouis of Germany translated the dispossessed Bishop Anschar to Bremen.\r\nNow the Archbishop of Cologne claimed jurisdiction over Bremen and\r\ndeclared that the temporal power could not dismember an ecclesiastical\r\njurisdiction. Both parties agreed to refer the case to Rome. Nicholas I.\r\nconfirmed the separation and ratified the transference of Anschar.\r\nCharles the Great would have settled the case himself. Another victory\r\nwas thus won in the name of Pseudo-Isidore. The policy of breaking down\r\nall interposition between the successor of Peter and the episcopacy had\r\nbeen clearly set forth.\r\n\r\nA test of this principle came in the case of Hincmar, the able and\r\npowerful Archbishop of Rheims. In 861 he summarily suspended Rathod,\r\nBishop of Soissons, for disobeying the sentence of a provincial synod in\r\nreinstating a priest whom he had unjustly expelled. Rathod at once\r\nappealed to the Pope and asked permission of Hincmar to go to Rome to\r\npresent his suit. Hincmar refused the request and called Rathod before a\r\nsecond synod for contempt, when he was degraded from his office and\r\nimprisoned in a monastery. Once more Rathod made a touching appeal to\r\nNicholas I.[342:1] who forthwith rebuked Hincmar and ordered him to\r\nrestore Rathod to his see, and to send him to Rome. King Charles the\r\nBald was ordered, \"by his love to God and his duty to the Holy See,\" to\r\nsee that the order was enforced. Both Hincmar and Charles refused and\r\nRathod remained a prisoner for two years. Papal power was on trial, but\r\nNicholas I. was equal to the situation. At last Charles was persuaded to\r\nintervene. Rathod was released and sent to Rome, but was not reinstated\r\nin his bishopric. The Pope reinstated him to office. To prove his\r\nauthority he quoted the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals, which the Frankish\r\nclergy had framed to insure their own independence.[342:2] Hincmar\r\nremonstrated, but in the end was forced to apologise and obey. \"Thus,\"\r\ncomplained Hincmar, \"was a criminal, solemnly deposed by the unanimous\r\njudgment of five ecclesiastical provinces of this realm, reinstated by\r\nthe Pope, not by ordinary canonical rule, but by an arbitrary act of\r\npower, in a summary way, without inquiry, and against the consent of his\r\nnatural judges.\" Metropolitan independence was crushed, the royal power\r\nwas forced to obey by the awful threat of excommunication, and papal\r\nsupremacy was triumphant. Truly a new epoch had appeared in the rise of\r\nthe mediæval Church, when the Pope could proudly declare that \"the\r\nprivileges of the Holy See are the panoply of the Church and title-deeds\r\nof him who is the supreme lord of the priesthood for the government of\r\nall in authority under him and for the comfort of every one that shall\r\nsuffer wrong or injury from subordinate powers\"[343:1]; that \"the\r\naction of synods, general or provincial, might be peremptorily arrested\r\nby a simple appeal to Rome . . . at any stage of the proceeding\"; that\r\nevery bishop must give lawful obedience to the \"King of Bishops\"; and\r\nthat \"any one, without exception of person, who shall disobey the\r\ndoctrine, mandates, interdicts, or decretals, published by the Apostolic\r\nBishop on behalf of the Catholic faith, the discipline of the Church,\r\nthe correction of the faithful, the reformation of evil-doers, and the\r\ndiscouragement of vice, let him be accursed.\"[343:2]\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the schismatic, heretical Eastern Church, however, all\r\ncareful reserve vanished and without fear or caution the Roman Pontiffs\r\nassert their prerogatives in a clear, decisive, and peremptory tone. In\r\nthe Photian schism at Constantinople, Nicholas I. assumed the right to\r\ndecide which of the two claimants to the patriarchate was legitimate. To\r\nPhotius, who had secured the office by imperial aid, the Roman pontiff\r\nwrote a letter which up to that time was unsurpassed for supreme papal\r\narrogance:\r\n\r\n     Our Lord and Saviour . . . established the foundations of his\r\n     church upon the Rock Peter. . . . Now upon this foundation the\r\n     appointed builders have from time to time heaped many precious\r\n     stones, till by this unwearied diligence the whole building\r\n     has been perfected into indissoluble solidity. . . . Since\r\n     this church of Peter is the head of all churches, it is\r\n     imperative upon all to adopt her as their model in every\r\n     matter of ecclesiastical expediency and institution. . . .\r\n     From her all synods and all councils derive their power to\r\n     bind and to loose.[343:3]\r\n\r\nThe pontificate of Nicholas I., who died in 867, marks the acme of\r\npapal power during this period. The history of the Western Church,\r\ncontrolled by Rome, during the latter part of the ninth and the tenth\r\ncentury, covers a period of unparalleled corruption and debility--\"a\r\ndeath-sleep of moral and spiritual exhaustion.\" The Papacy as a\r\nconstructive spiritual force almost disappears from view. The lofty\r\nideas of Leo I., Gregory I., and Nicholas I.--their magnificent\r\nambitions for the Church, their imperial rule, and their commanding,\r\naggressive spirit--all disappeared. The causes may be found in weak,\r\nwicked, worldly Popes, in anarchy and political confusion in Italy, and\r\nin feudalism. The Church was reaping the reward of a close alliance with\r\nthe state. All the gains made by the Church during this epoch were of a\r\nsecular character. The moral and spiritual powers of Latin Christianity\r\nlay dormant beneath a mass of corruption, self-seeking, and worldly\r\npassions which covered them and nearly extinguished them. The marvellous\r\nvitality of the organisation of the Church alone saved her from\r\ndisintegration in that period of decentralisation. The spirit of the\r\nPseudo-Isidorian Decretals, from this standpoint, had become the saviour\r\nof the Church. The next force that appeared in western Europe to rescue\r\nthe Church from the low state of spiritual degeneration to which she had\r\nfallen was, strange to say, the Holy Roman Empire under the guidance of\r\nanother mighty German ruler.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nA.--PRIMARY:\r\n\r\n  1.--Roberts and Donaldson, _Ante-Nicene Christian Library_, ix.,\r\n          pt. 2, p. 144 _ff._ Has letters of six Popes.\r\n\r\n  2.--Schaff, _Ante-Nicene Fathers_, viii., 601.\r\n\r\n  3.--Henderson, _Select Historical Documents of the Middle Ages_,\r\n          319.

VIII.--Relics and saints. IX.--Sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholic Church, based on the Bible and tradition, satisfying\r\nthe religious needs of the age, and moulded by the historical forces of\r\nthe period, changed from the democratic, apostolic Church to the\r\npowerful monarchial hierarchy of the Middle Ages, by a natural,\r\nhistorical process. The Pope, the Bishop of Bishops, stood at the head\r\nof the well organised hierarchy as the source of faith, the supreme\r\nlaw-giver, the distributor of justice, the resort of last appeal, and\r\nthe grantor of offices, honour, and favours. He came to hold the balance\r\nof power in the world-politics and claimed supremacy in secular affairs.\r\nTo enforce his will he had an army of priests and monks, the sanctity\r\nand prestige of Peter's Chair, and the formidable weapons of\r\nexcommunication and interdict. To assist him in his multitudinous\r\nduties, an extensive papal court had been gradually built up.\r\n\r\nJust below the Pope in the hierarchy came the archbishops, or primates,\r\nor metropolitans.[348:1] After the third century, the term metropolitan\r\nin the East meant the bishop who lived in the capital of a province. The\r\nCouncil of Nicæa recognised the office and gave the metropolitan the\r\nright to ordain bishops.[348:2] The Council of Antioch clearly defined\r\nthe jurisdiction of the metropolitan.[348:3] He ruled the suffragan\r\nbishops, conducted episcopal elections, confirmed and ordained bishops,\r\ncalled and presided over annual episcopal synods. Somewhat later he came\r\nto exercise the right of deciding appeals.[348:4] Gradually the name and\r\nprerogatives were extended to the West, where about the seventh century\r\nthe metropolitans were very powerful,[348:5] but by degrees they lost\r\ntheir power when secular princes, like the Merovingian kings, usurped\r\ntheir functions. Even the bishops adopted the short-sighted policy of\r\npreferring to have their superior at Rome instead of in their own\r\nprovince. Under the Carolingians, especially Charles the Great, and the\r\nPseudo-Isidorian Decretals, however, they regained something of their\r\nearlier prestige. But they were subjected to the direct control of the\r\nPope and existed as useful intermediaries between Rome and the ordinary\r\nbishops. In that limited sphere of activity, however, there were still\r\nmany important duties left to the metropolitan of the Middle Ages. As\r\nearly as the sixth century the Pope at Rome, as patriarch, claimed the\r\nright to sanction the election of a metropolitan by the clergy of the\r\nprovince, and bestowed the \"pallium\" upon the candidate. The\r\nmetropolitans, it must be remembered, were not generally separated from\r\narchbishops in the early history of the Church. When the differentiation\r\ndid evolve, the archbishop became superior to the metropolitan.\r\n\r\nThe title archbishop was unknown in the Church before the fourth\r\ncentury. At first it was used as a sign of honour without implying\r\nsuperior jurisdiction over bishops. Perhaps Athanasius first used it in\r\nspeaking of Bishop Alexander of Alexandria. Then Gregory Nazianzen\r\napplied it to Athanasius himself. Soon it came to be used in connection\r\nwith the bishops of the most important sees in the East. Liberatus gave\r\nall the patriarchs the title of archbishops. The Council of Chalcedon\r\neven applied the name to the mighty patriarchs of Rome and\r\nConstantinople. When the Empire was divided into dioceses, which in turn\r\nwere subdivided into provinces, an exarch or vicar was placed in the\r\ncapital of each diocese. In conscious imitation, the Church established\r\necclesiastical exarchs or patriarchs in these local capitals. Archbishop\r\nwas a common title for this office. The archbishop ordained the\r\nmetropolitans, convened diocesan synods, received appeals from the\r\nmetropolitan and his provincial synod, and enforced discipline in his\r\ndiocese. In the West in the seventh century Isidore of Seville ranked\r\nthe archbishop higher than the metropolitan. The precise distinction\r\nbetween the two offices, however, was not very clear and, finally, was\r\nlost entirely. These officers usually sided with the secular authorities\r\nagainst the Pope and tended to favour the organisation of national\r\nChurches with patriarchs at their head. They attempted likewise to\r\nsubject the bishops and priests to their rule and thus curtail the power\r\nof the Pope. The Popes, however, saw the danger and sought to avert it\r\nby appointing several archbishops in each country, and bestowing upon\r\none of them the title of \"primate\" with the delegated powers of the Holy\r\nSee. Thus England had the archbishops of Canterbury, the oldest (seventh\r\ncentury) and most important,[350:1] and of York (eighth century).\r\nGermany was ruled by the archbishops of Mayence, who was \"primus\" and\r\nwho served as imperial chancellor until the time of Otto the\r\nGreat,[350:2] Trier (eighth century), Cologne (eighth century), Salzburg\r\n(eighth century), Hamburg-Bremen (ninth century), and Magdeburg (tenth\r\ncentury).[350:3] France possessed the archbishops of Rheims, who was\r\nrecognised as primate,[350:4] Aix, Aux, Bordeaux, Bourges, and Rouen. In\r\nItaly the Pope had a continual struggle with the archbishops of Milan,\r\nwho claimed as their founder the apostle Barnabas, Aquileia, and\r\nRavenna. The use of the title primate does not come into ordinary use,\r\nit seems, until after the appearance of the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals.\r\n\r\nNext in the hierarchy came the bishops. They resented, as a general\r\nrule, the pretensions of both the metropolitans and the archbishops and\r\nrecognised the Pope as their friend and superior. Since all western\r\nEurope was divided up into episcopal dioceses, with one bishop in each\r\ndiocese, they were both very numerous and very powerful, particularly\r\nin local affairs.\r\n\r\nFor the first five centuries of the Christian era the election of\r\nbishops in the Church followed one general pattern. The neighbouring\r\nbishops nominated while the local clergy and laity approved the election\r\nand gave the requisite testimony of character. But with the evolution in\r\nthe organisation of the Church, and as a result of the close alliance\r\nwith the state, a series of important changes occurred. (1) With the\r\nrise of the metropolitans there appeared a new factor in the selection\r\nof a bishop. The metropolitan usually conducted the election, and\r\nconfirmed and ordained the candidate. This came to be regulated by\r\nChurch canons. (2) With the ascendancy of the state over the Church the\r\nselection of bishops was practically transferred to the laity. At times\r\nEmperors alone nominated. After the sixth century, the right of royal\r\nassent was generally acknowledged. It was but a short step to convert\r\nthat secular assumption into a right of nomination. Thus the ruling\r\npower had come to control the election of bishops quite generally\r\nthroughout the mediæval Church. Among the chief qualifications for the\r\noffice were, in addition to a good character, an age limit of fifty\r\nyears, ordination as priest, or at least as deacon, and membership in\r\nthe local clergy. But these requirements were often broken and waived.\r\n\r\nThe bishop occupied an office of arduous duties and grave\r\nresponsibilities. It might be said that he was the powerful ruler of his\r\nprovince. He administered all the Christian sacraments. He enforced\r\ndiscipline. He received all income and offerings, and managed all the\r\necclesiastical business of his diocese. He exercised the power of\r\nordination and confirmation, and thus perpetuated the Christian\r\nministry. He did all the formal preaching and by visitation kept an\r\noversight of the whole Church under his care. He was the natural medium\r\nof communication to and from his people and clergy. He was also an\r\nimportant factor in the local synod and served as the ecclesiastical\r\njudge of his district. All such matters as liturgy, worship, alms,\r\ndedication of churches, patronage, and protection of minors, widows, and\r\nthe unfortunate came under his jurisdiction. Nor did his cares end here.\r\nThrough the synod he helped to rule the province and through the general\r\ncouncil he participated in the government of the Church at large.\r\n\r\nThe bishops controlled the priests, who were found in every section of\r\nChristendom in the sixth century, and who came into vital touch with the\r\nmasses of the laity. As early as the third century, indeed, all churches\r\nbegan to conform to a single type. The independence of the presbyter of\r\nthe early Church disappeared with the rise of the episcopal system. The\r\nsubordination of the priest became, by the sixth century, complete. This\r\nresult was inevitable because of the rise of the synodal system, the\r\nassimilation of the organisation of the Empire, and the development of\r\nthe parochial system, which subdivided the diocese into smaller sections\r\nin the hands of priests.[352:1] The priests administered the sacraments\r\nto the people to whom they were the very bread of life and the means of\r\nsalvation, heard them in their confessions, inflicted penances and gave\r\nthem counsel, baptised their children, confirmed them, watched over all\r\ntheir deeds on earth, closed their eyes in death, and prepared them for\r\nthe world to come, and even through prayers and masses interceded for\r\ntheir forgiveness in purgatory. Working side by side with the priests\r\nwere the countless monks and nuns fairly swarming over western Europe,\r\nwho also came into intimate touch with the masses. They were the\r\nteachers and preachers of the common people. In the hands of these\r\npriests and monks rested almost entirely the humane and charitable\r\ninstitutions of the Middle Ages. The true religion of Jesus was likewise\r\nin their hands rather than in the hands of the higher clergy.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the hierarchical pyramid were the laity, who by the\r\ntwelfth century included all the people of western Europe, except a\r\nportion of Spain. Both canon law and imperial law forbade their\r\nperforming any sacerdotal functions and ordered them \"to be obedient to\r\nthe order handed down by the Lord.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of morality,[353:1] this period was one of\r\npronounced contrasts. Christian virtues and heathen vices, the strictest\r\nasceticism and the grossest sensuality, tyranny and crude democracy, all\r\nexisted side by side with apparently no serious conflicts. It was an age\r\nof anarchy, confusion, lawlessness, immorality, and highway robbery on\r\nland and sea, accompanied by boldness, chivalry, and heroism. In the\r\nEast, the Church had to contend with \"the vices of an effete\r\ncivilisation and a corrupt court.\" In the West, many of the old Roman\r\nvices were continued and even invigorated by fresh barbaric blood. It\r\nwould be difficult to imagine anything more corrupt than the Merovingian\r\ncourt.[353:2] Of the whole period Gibbon declares that it would be\r\nimpossible \"to find anywhere more vice or less virtue.\"\r\n\r\nThe people at this time might be called more religious than moral. A\r\nlittle piety would cover a multitude of sins in the eyes of even the\r\nbest. A whole life of wickedness and evil-doing was all wiped out and a\r\nhome in heaven assured by the building of a church, monastery, shrine,\r\nor hospital, or by deeding property to the Church, or by doing some\r\npious deed. An exaggerated belief in the supernatural and miraculous was\r\nuniversal. A physical hell, heaven, devil, and angels were just as real\r\nto the people as the earth, day and night, the sun and moon, and the\r\nseasons. The worship of saints and relics was very common, and\r\nparticularly in favour with the most wicked. The seventh century had\r\nmore saints than any preceding, except possibly the fourth. Under these\r\ncircumstances, it was not uncommon to find good used as a cloak for evil\r\nand the greatest apparent sanctity united with the worst\r\nlicentiousness.[354:1]\r\n\r\nThe clergy led society and set moral standards which the masses followed\r\nwithout question. They embraced all social ranks from the sons of kings\r\nto the sons of slaves. Politically they shared with the kings and nobles\r\nthe rule of the people. The upper clergy had huge estates like the\r\nlanded nobles, and were, in fact, recruited largely from the younger\r\nsons of noblemen. The clergy were everywhere immune from taxation and\r\nmilitary service. Charles the Great and his successors gave them all the\r\nprivileges granted by the Eastern Emperors from Constantine on. They\r\ncould not be tried or sued before civil courts, but had their own\r\ntribunals. They were supported by the income from landed estates, gifts\r\nfrom the pious, and legally established tithes. Morally, they were as a\r\nrule superior to their flocks, although there are many disgraceful\r\nexceptions. Europe was cursed at this time with tramp priests without\r\nchurches who swarmed over Europe demanding a livelihood because of the\r\nsanctity of their office. Contrary to law, bishops wore swords and lost\r\ntheir lives on battle-fields--even Popes engaged in warfare.[355:1]\r\nDrunkenness was not infrequent among the clergy and licentiousness was a\r\ncommon complaint against them.[355:2] The minutes of Church synods are\r\nfull of censures and punishments for clerical sins and vices like\r\nfornication, intemperance, avarice, hunting and hawking, gambling,\r\nbetting, attending horse races, going to theatres, keeping houses of\r\nprostitution, and others.[355:3] Celibacy was the prescribed rule of the\r\nWest, but many of the clergy were either married or lived with\r\nmistresses. Hadrian II. was married before he became Pope and his\r\nson-in-law murdered both the Pope's wife and daughter (868).[355:4] But\r\nthere were of course many noteworthy examples of purity in all ranks of\r\nthe clergy. Married laymen upon entering the priesthood or a convent\r\ngave up their wives. The lowest depths, perhaps, were reached in the\r\ntenth and eleventh centuries, when even the Popes themselves, who should\r\nhave stood for all that was best, set the example for the greatest evil.\r\nReform did not appear until the coming of the monastic order of Clugny,\r\nthe German Emperors, and the Hildebrandine Popes.\r\n\r\nThe Church, however, during this trying, formative period was the moral\r\nark of safety for Europe. It fought vice and encouraged virtue. It was\r\nthe only promoter of education and culture. It taught the Apostles'\r\nCreed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments, and along with them\r\nwere learned lessons of faith and duty. It emphasised both the need and\r\nimportance of prayer, fasts, charity, pity, hospitality, and other\r\nvirtues. Its ideals were always high--far above the masses of the Church\r\nmembers--though in practice the clergy did not always conform to the\r\nideals. The Church was the one great light that pointed the people of\r\nthis epoch to a brighter day and a better civilisation. The sanctity of\r\nthe home life for the laity and of celibacy for the priests was\r\nasserted. Divorce was seldom permitted.[356:1] Woman's position and\r\nproperty rights were advanced. The Virgin Mary was constantly extolled\r\nas the incarnation of womanly purity, love, and devotion. Much wise and\r\nennobling legislation on the subject of marriage was enacted. There are\r\nmany instances, too, where the head of the Church, or one of his\r\nofficers, bravely protected injured innocence, even against kings.\r\nPolygamy, concubinage, secret marriage, the marriage of relatives, and\r\nmarriage with Jews, heathen, or heretics were forbidden.[356:2]\r\n\r\nThe Church inherited the patristic conception of Rome in regard to\r\nslavery. Jesus had made no direct reference to the social organisation.\r\nSt. Paul, however, spoke of the relations of slave and master.[356:3]\r\n\"The world into which Christianity was born recognised slavery\r\neverywhere.\"[357:1] The early Church tolerated slavery, but emancipation\r\nwas held to be an act of Christian charity[357:2]; hence converted\r\nChristians often freed their slaves on baptism.[357:3] The Church\r\nFathers recognised the institution of slavery as a moral wrong\r\nestablished on a legal basis, but called Christian slaves brothers.\r\nLactantius told Constantine that slaves were brothers in Jesus.[357:4]\r\nAmbrose suggested that the slave might be even superior to his\r\nmaster.[357:5] Augustine held that slavery was a sin which originated in\r\nthe Noachian curse, but that Christ's sacrifice freed slaves,\r\nconsequently the curse would disappear.[357:6]\r\n\r\nThe mediæval Church, inheriting the patristic view, sought not to\r\nabolish slavery, but to ameliorate it. Masters were requested,\r\ntherefore, to provide spouses for their slaves.[357:7] Prayers were\r\noffered up constantly for the removal of their hardships.[357:8] They\r\nwere granted all the Church feast and fast days.[357:9] Among the\r\nChristians there were many acts of manumission.[357:10] Constantine and\r\nhis successors enacted many laws favourable to slaves.[357:11] The\r\nbarbarian invasion, however, postponed for a thousand years the general\r\nemancipation of slaves. The Church itself was a slave-owner and slaves\r\nwere found on the lands of convents, bishops, and Popes.[358:1] Even\r\none of the Popes, Calistus, had been a slave.[358:2] But at the same\r\ntime the Church was always an asylum for slaves and sought to protect\r\nthem from cruel masters. Gregory the Great declared that all slaves held\r\nby Jews were free[358:3] and also emancipated heathen slaves upon\r\nturning Christian.[358:4] Thus both by precept and example the Church\r\nwas the one great force paving the way for the gradual abolition of\r\nslavery.[358:5]\r\n\r\nThe Church, as the great advocate of peace and order, strove to abolish\r\nfamily feuds, blood-revenge, and private wars by substituting legal\r\naction and legal penalty against the author of crime.[358:6] The synod\r\nof Toledo in 693 forbade duels and private feuds.[358:7] The synod of\r\nCharroux in 989 and the Bishop of Puy in 990 proclaimed the \"Peace of\r\nGod.\"[358:8] The synod of Poitiers in 1004, in proclaiming the \"Peace of\r\nGod,\" decided that law should replace force in determining questions of\r\njustice. The synod of Limoges in 1031 issued an interdict against bloody\r\nfeuds. The Church everywhere sought to have disputes settled by fines\r\nrather than fighting, by arbitration rather than litigation, by\r\nwitnesses rather than by duels. The efforts of the Church in this era of\r\nlawlessness, of wanton bloodshed, and of insecurity of property, to\r\nmaintain peace and to secure justice form one of the most glorious\r\nchapters in her remarkable career. The Popes wrote letters and published\r\nencyclicals to recommend vows and habits of concord to all Christian\r\nnations. Great councils were called to spread abroad ideas of amity and\r\nbrotherly love. The clergy preached it and enthusiastic monks went from\r\nvillage to village to proclaim it in the name of the \"Prince of Peace.\"\r\nA veritable crusade of peace swept over Europe, and denounced war as\r\nanti-Christian. Brotherhoods of the Peace of God were formed to curb the\r\nmilitant feudal barons and to protect commerce, agriculture, women,\r\nchildren, travellers, strangers, and holy clerks. When the whole\r\necclesiastical machinery of the Church, with its power to withhold\r\nsalvation gained through the holy sacraments and with its mighty weapons\r\nof excommunication and interdict, was wielded in behalf of peace, it was\r\na force that could not easily be resisted.[359:1] To the Church,\r\ntherefore, must be given the credit of making the first determined\r\neffort to limit, if not to abolish, the ravages of private war.\r\n\r\nThe famous \"Truce of God,\" which originated in Aquitania in 1033, marks\r\na new era.[359:2] Private war was the curse of the Middle Ages and the\r\nChurch made an effort to check the evil. According to its provisions,\r\nbishops and abbots were to see to it that all feuds should cease from\r\nWednesday evening till Monday morning. The penalty for violating the\r\ntruce was at first excommunication, but later expulsion from a\r\nbishopric, loss of a benefice or property, severance of the right hand,\r\ndecapitation, scalping, and other punishments were added. Archbishop\r\nRaimbald of Arles with other bishops and abbots asked the Church in\r\nItaly in 1041 to adopt the \"Truce of God.\"[360:1] Pope Nicholas II.\r\n(1059) and Alexander II. (1068) made public proclamation of the peace,\r\nand, as a result of all these endeavours, it soon spread over\r\nFrance,[360:2] Italy,[360:3] Burgundy, Spain, and Germany.[360:4] Rulers\r\nwere not slow to sanction and to enforce these peace measures. Emperor\r\nHenry IV. issued an edict in 1085 to enforce the \"Truce of God\" under\r\nfrightfully severe penalties.[360:5] Pope Urban II. in the Council of\r\nClermont, held a decade later, made it the general law of the\r\nChurch.[360:6] The time was extended to the periods between Advent and\r\nEpiphany, Ash Wednesday and Easter, Ascension Day and Pentecost.[360:7]\r\nVarious festivals and vigils were also included. If strictly enforced\r\nthe \"Truce of God\" would have given Christendom peace for about 240 days\r\nout of the year. Its operation was preceded by the ringing of bells. The\r\nfirst Lateran Councils (1121, 1139, 1179) confirmed it and made it a\r\npart of the _Corpus Juris Canonici_. The \"Truce of God\" later helped to\r\nproduce the \"land peace\" in various parts of the Empire.[360:8]\r\n\r\nThe Church sanctioned and used the \"judgment of God\" or the ordeal as a\r\nbetter means of obtaining justice than by war.[361:1] This process of\r\njustice was not new, but had prevailed in the Orient and among the Celts\r\nand Teutons. It rested on this fundamental principle that the accused is\r\nguilty until he proves himself innocent and that God, as the source of\r\njustice, will protect the innocent. \"Let doubtful cases,\" ran a\r\nCarolingian capitulary, \"be determined by the judgment of God. The\r\njudges may decide that which they clearly know, but that which they\r\ncannot know shall be reserved for divine judgment. He whom God has\r\nreserved for His own judgment may not be condemned by human means.\"\r\n\r\nThere were four different kinds of ordeals: by water, by fire, by\r\nbattle, and by some sacred emblem.[361:2] The ordeal by hot water was\r\nthe oldest form in Europe.[361:3] It typified the deluge and hell.\r\nHincmar of Rheims appears to have recommended it first. The accused was\r\ncompelled, with naked arm, to find a stone or ring in a kettle of\r\nboiling water, or merely to thrust his arm into it. If his arm was\r\nscalded he was guilty, if not, innocent.[361:4] The ordeal by cold water\r\nwas probably introduced by Pope Eugenius II. (824-827). The theory was\r\nthat pure water will not receive a criminal, hence it was believed that\r\nthe guilty would float and the innocent sink. The accused, therefore,\r\nwas bound and thrown into the water, but held by a rope with which to\r\npull him out.[361:5]\r\n\r\nThe ordeal by fire was performed either by hot iron or stones, or by a\r\npure flame of fire. The accused was compelled to walk barefooted over\r\nsix or twelve red-hot ploughshares, or to carry a piece of red-hot iron\r\nin his bare hand nine feet or more. The unburned, of course, were\r\ninnocent.[362:1] Or the accused was asked to stick his hand into a\r\nflame, or walk with bare feet and legs through the fire.[362:2]\r\n\r\nThe battle ordeals were very old and widespread in Europe although not\r\nintroduced into England until the Norman Conquest. They were used for\r\nboth personal and international disputes. The right to contest was\r\nusually restricted to free men, but the young, sick, old, female, and\r\nclergy could furnish substitutes. Here again God, the Judge in all these\r\ncases, gave victory to the innocent.[362:3] The Church regarded this\r\nform of ordeal with disfavour. Both councils and Popes declared boldly\r\nagainst it. Innocent II., Alexander III., Clement III., Celestine III.,\r\nand Innocent III. were outspoken in their opposition. It was expressly\r\nforbidden the clergy to engage in these combats without special license.\r\nChristian burial was even refused to those who fell in such combats.\r\nCivil law enforced the ecclesiastical opposition and thus gradually\r\nsecured the elimination of the evil. This ordeal did not die out until\r\nthe sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe sacred ordeals had to do with religious emblems. In the ordeal of\r\nthe cross both the accused and the defendant stood before a cross with\r\nuplifted arms while special divine service was performed, or the arms\r\nwere extended in the form of a cross. The arms of the guilty person\r\ndropped first. Pepin first used it for divorce cases (752). Charles the\r\nGreat extended it to territorial disputes (806). Louis the Pious\r\nabolished it in 816 because it brought the holy symbol into disrepute.\r\nThe eucharist was likewise employed to protect the innocent and punish\r\nthe guilty. The synod of Worms in 868 enjoined it upon bishops and\r\npriests accused of murder, adultery, theft, and sorcery. In the trial\r\nthe eucharist was swallowed with this adjuration from the priest: \"May\r\nthis body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ be a judgment to thee this\r\nday.\" In the famous encounter of Hildebrand and Henry IV. at Canossa,\r\nthe Pope challenged the Emperor to undergo this ordeal, but the wily\r\nGerman refused.[363:1] A use was also made of relics for similar\r\npurposes--a test that was probably of ecclesiastical origin. The accused\r\nplaced his hands on the sacred relics and made an oath of his innocence.\r\n\r\nThe Church played a very conspicuous part in all these ordeals. Church\r\ncouncils sanctioned them[363:2] and the clergy favoured them.[363:3] Not\r\ninfrequently they were used to further the interests of the Church and\r\nto punish heretics. Priests usually prepared the contestants by fasts,\r\nprayer, and special service, presided over the trial, and pronounced\r\njudgment in God's name. This method of securing justice, however,\r\nprovoked considerable opposition within the Church. As early as the\r\nsixth century Bishop Avitus of Vienne opposed the battle ordeal in the\r\nBurgundian Code. St. Agobard of Lyons (d. 840) wrote two enlightened\r\ntreatises against the duel and the whole system of the ordeal.[364:1]\r\nOccupants of St. Peter's Chair like Leo IV., Nicholas I., Stephen VI.,\r\nSylvester II., Alexander II., Alexander III., Celestine III., Honorius\r\nIII., all condemned the institution.[364:2] The famous fourth Lateran\r\nCouncil held under Innocent III. in 1215 forbade the use of religious\r\nceremonies in these trials and thus practically abolished the\r\ninstitution. Secular rulers also sought to end the practice.\r\nUnfortunately, the Inquisition, which employed methods somewhat similar\r\nto the ordeal, followed too closely in its wake.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important service of the Church to the civilisation of\r\nthe Middle Ages was the extensive cultivation of charity, \"the queen of\r\nthe Christian graces.\"[364:3] Both the example and teachings of Jesus\r\nserved as a model and were supplemented by the words and work of the\r\nApostles, particularly Paul. In the early Church charity was a cardinal\r\nprinciple.[364:4] At first the remnants of the eucharistic feasts were\r\nemployed as sources of relief to the poor and needy; later free-will\r\nofferings given to the bishop and collections taken in the churches were\r\nemployed to the same end. Usually seven deacons distributed these\r\ncontributions to the poor, sick, and needy in each congregation.[364:5]\r\n\r\nIn Rome the organisation of charity was begun comparatively early. The\r\nparish was introduced in the third century and in the fourth century\r\nPope Anastasius divided Rome into fourteen \"regions\" and in them founded\r\nand endowed deaconries. Gregory the Great in the sixth century created\r\nseven districts in Rome ruled over by seven deacons and an archdeacon,\r\nbuilt a hospital in each district, controlled by a deacon and a steward\r\nfor the poor, sick, and orphans; and formed thirty parishes with\r\nthirty-six priests. He sold his extensive possessions and gave the\r\nproceeds to charity. Many of the great Fathers of the Church made\r\nsimilar sacrifices and never wearied of enjoining the duty of charity on\r\nChristians. The churches of Rome had large estates, especially in\r\nSicily. One third of their income was given quarterly to\r\ncharities.[365:1] Pope Gregory the Great also made monthly distributions\r\nof food to the poor, and each day sent part of his meals to feed the\r\nneedy at his door. This model arrangement for charitable purposes in the\r\ncapital of Christendom was copied quite extensively elsewhere and\r\nenlisted the services of thousands of priests, monks, and nuns in all\r\nsections of western Europe.\r\n\r\nAfter Constantine legalised Christianity, charity became institutional\r\nand endowed, first in the East, then to the westward.[365:2] Perhaps the\r\nfirst public hospital was founded in Rome by Fabiola, a Roman lady, in\r\nthe fourth century. St. Pammachus established another in the Eternal\r\nCity. Paulinus built one in Nola. Still others were planted in Naples,\r\nSicily, and Sardinia. Poorhouses, orphanages, and homes for the aged\r\nwere likewise begun in this early period. As Christianity was spread\r\nover Europe by the missionary monks these charitable institutions were\r\nplanted by it to help and comfort thousands in this period of war,\r\nfamine, and pestilence, and to remain as the choicest heritage to the\r\nmodern from the mediæval Church. In theory, mediæval charity was made\r\none of the chief acts of piety, the most certain means of salvation, and\r\nperhaps emphasised too much the benefits to the donor and to his dead\r\nrelatives, rather than to the worthy recipient.\r\n\r\nChurch discipline originated in the \"power of the keys\" and in the\r\ncontrol of the sacraments. In the early Church it was a \"purely\r\nspiritual jurisdiction.\"[366:1] After Constantine, however, it touched\r\nthe civil and social status of the delinquents. During the entire Middle\r\nAges it was a tremendous power because it was believed that the Church,\r\nruled by the divinely appointed Pope and his army of ecclesiastics, was\r\nthe \"dispenser of eternal salvation\" and that exclusion from her\r\ncommunion without repentance incurred eternal damnation. Discipline was\r\nadministered either directly by the Pope or by the bishops and their\r\nrepresentatives, the archdeacons, or in each congregation by the priest.\r\nCivil authorities aided the Church in enforcing discipline. Charles the\r\nGreat ordered the bishops to hold annual public synodical courts to try\r\ncases of incest, murder, adultery, robbery, theft, and other vices\r\ncontrary to God's laws.[366:2] The clergy and laity alike were\r\ninvestigated. Seven irreproachable synodal judges from each congregation\r\nreported to the synod on the state of morals and religion.[366:3]\r\nSimilar synods were held in Spain and England and soon came to be\r\ncommon throughout Europe. The ordinary penalties inflicted were fines,\r\nfasting, pilgrimages, scourging, imprisonment, and deeds of charity.\r\nObstinate cases incurred excommunication. The penalties inflicted on the\r\nclergy were more severe than those on the laity.[367:1] About the same\r\ntime developed the practice by which the priest heard the\r\nconfessions[367:2] of his flock and doled out the punishment for their\r\nprivate offences. But by the ninth century confession to a priest had\r\nnot yet become compulsory.\r\n\r\nThe most severe punishment on the individual was excommunication.[367:3]\r\nIt could be pronounced by the Pope against a layman, either king or\r\ncommon man, or against a bishop or priest; or by a bishop against a\r\nlayman or a priest. Its operation was direct and its effects severe. It\r\ncut the excommunicate off from the sacraments which alone could insure\r\nhis salvation and subjected him to temporal punishments. As long as he\r\nwas under the ban, he was a social outcast, like an outlawed criminal or\r\na dangerous wild beast, debarred from all social greetings, food,\r\nshelter, and all intercourse. To kill him was not murder and he was left\r\nto die in lonely starvation. By the secular law, too, he lost all civil\r\nrights, could be seized and thrown into prison, and forfeited to the\r\nstate all his property.[367:4] His whole family, likewise, were subject\r\nto the same disabilities.[367:5] If a king, his subjects were all\r\nreleased from allegiance to him. He was consigned to everlasting\r\npunishment, often with the most terrific curses, which were frequently\r\nwritten down with sacred wine and ink. This terrible fate dangled over\r\nthe head of every member of the Church, dead as well as alive, but, of\r\ncourse, it followed only after the proof of guilt had been established\r\nin a careful, formal trial and after earnest entreaties to repent had\r\nbeen made. The theory, however, was too often abused.[368:1] With\r\nsincere repentance the punishment ceased and absolution followed.[368:2]\r\n\r\nThere are examples almost without number of the employment of\r\nexcommunication, but a few conspicuous examples will suffice to show its\r\noperation. Ambrose in 383 excommunicated Maximus for murdering Gratian,\r\nthe Emperor.[368:3] Gregory the Great excommunicated Archbishop Maximus\r\nof Salona and forced him to repentance (600).[368:4] The Archbishop of\r\nSens (seventh century) launched the curse against unknown robbers of his\r\nchurch.[368:5] Pope Benedict VIII. excommunicated the despoiler of the\r\nmonastery of St. Giles.[368:6] There were very many cases against kings,\r\ncriminals, heretics, etc., and the punishment was even applied to\r\nanimals. Thus in 975 the Archbishop of Treves excommunicated the\r\nannoying sparrows. Caterpillars which were ravishing the diocese of Laon\r\nwere put under the ban in 1120 by the bishop. Even St. Bernard, on an\r\noccasion which may have been justifiable, pronounced an anathema in 1121\r\non a swarm of flies which bothered him while he was making a pious\r\nspeech.[369:1] Not only was this ecclesiastical cudgel used with the\r\nmost telling effects in enforcing the law of the Church upon the\r\ndisobedient and unbelieving, but it was not infrequently abused for\r\npersonal revenge and spite or for other low motives.[369:2]\r\n\r\nThe interdict was another form of punishment, issued by a Pope or a\r\nbishop, against a city, diocese, district, or country, and involved the\r\ninnocent along with the guilty. It had a counterpart among the barbarian\r\ntribes which made the family responsible for the crimes of individual\r\nmembers. This may have been its origin, for the Church adopted the same\r\nidea in applying excommunication to the barbarians. It began in a mild\r\nform as early as the fifth century, but ere long was a common\r\npunishment. The city of Rouen was put under the interdict in 586 for the\r\nmurder of its bishop.[369:3] The Bishop of Laon in 869 pronounced the\r\ninterdict on his diocese, but Archbishop Hincmar of Rheims removed it.\r\nThe synod of Limoges enforced the \"Truce of God\" in 1031 by this\r\nmeans.[369:4] Gregory VII. applied it to the province of Gnesen to\r\npunish King Boleslaw II. for the crime of murder, and Alexander II. in\r\n1180 thus afflicted all Scotland because the ruler expelled a papal\r\nbishop. Innocent III. in 1200 suspended it over France, because of the\r\nmarital faithlessness of Philip Augustus, and for six years enforced it\r\nin England (1208) to humble King John. Its operation was very severe.\r\nAll religious worship was suspended, the churches were closed, priests\r\nrefused to perform marriage and burial ceremonies, the people were\r\nordered to fast as in Lent and were forbidden to shave or cut their\r\nhair.[370:1] Only the sacraments, of baptism and extreme unction could\r\nbe administered and then always behind closed doors. Penance and the\r\neucharist could be extended alone to the mortally sick. All inhabitants\r\nof the afflicted region were ordered to dress in mourning, fast, and act\r\nin humility. Church bells were tolled at certain hours in the day, when\r\nall people were to fall upon their knees in prayer for the removal of\r\nthe causes of the interdict. With such thunderbolts as the\r\nexcommunication and interdict in the hands of the great High Priest of\r\nthe Church, which could be hurled at will against any individual or\r\npeople, and when the people blindly and unquestionably submitted to\r\nthem, it can be seen how the power of the Papacy was augmented and the\r\nsubjection of the clergy and laity alike increased.\r\n\r\nThe mass was the very centre of all Church worship. Pope Gregory I.\r\nestablished its mediæval form. The celebration of the mass was the\r\nbloodless sacrifice of Christ to God for the world's sins, a\r\nreconciliation of heaven and earth, of benefit to the living and to the\r\npious dead. It is no wonder then that the mass was celebrated several\r\ntimes daily with the greatest ritualistic pomp and display. Masses for\r\nthe dead, too, became popular as the doctrine of purgatory\r\ndeveloped[370:2] and were usually celebrated as solitary masses. Lullus\r\neven ordered masses and fasts in order to obtain good weather.[370:3]\r\nThe dogma of transubstantiation while generally held had not yet become\r\nChurch law. Church worship throughout western Europe was conducted in\r\nLatin, and consequently was little understood by the masses of the\r\nlaity.\r\n\r\nAlthough preaching was not a necessary part of the regular Church\r\nservice, still it was not an unusual feature. Pope Gregory I. frequently\r\npreached with great earnestness, although his successors did not follow\r\nhis example. Bishops were required to preach, but their negligence was\r\nproverbial.[371:1] The priests were commanded to explain to their people\r\nthe Apostles' Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the nature of the\r\nsacraments. The models recommended were the homilies,[371:2] and the\r\nsermons of Gregory I.[371:3] The vernacular was used of course in all\r\npreaching and cathedral instruction.\r\n\r\nThe Church hymns of this period reflect the Christian life and worship.\r\nIn the Latin Church the hymns are divided into three periods: the\r\npatristic epoch to Gregory I. (d. 604); the mediæval epoch to Damiani\r\n(d. 1073); and the classical epoch to 1300. These Latin hymns possess\r\nmuch fervour and some genius, and have a very pronounced character. Most\r\nof them were inspired by the Blessed Virgin and next in favour came the\r\nsaints. There were many beautiful products like _Te Deum\r\nLaudamus_.[371:4] In the early churches no organ was used.[371:5] Pope\r\nVitalian (657-672) probably first employed one, while Pepin and Charles\r\nthe Great both received presents of this instrument from the East. After\r\nthe eighth century it was generally used during the Middle Ages.[372:1]\r\nChurch bells gradually came into use after the time of Constantine and\r\nwere very numerous during this period.[372:2]\r\n\r\nThe origin of the term sacrament is not very clear. The Latin\r\n_sacramentum_ meant the military oath of allegiance and the early\r\nFathers apparently used it in that sense.[372:3] It was also spoken of\r\nas _mysterium_ in the New Testament.[372:4] _Sacramentum_ was thus early\r\nunited with _mysterium_ to denote the solemn, instructive, semi-secret,\r\nexternal religious rites of worship. Augustine's definition, \"the\r\nvisible form of invisible grace,\" or \"a sign of a sacred thing,\" has\r\nbecome classic and was accepted for centuries. The number of sacraments\r\nwas an evolution. Tertullian mentions but two, the eucharist and\r\nbaptism. Cyprian spoke of a third, confirmation. The Vulgate apparently\r\nadded a fourth, marriage.[372:5] Augustine mentioned the Lord's Supper\r\nand baptism particularly as sacraments but used the word in many other\r\napplications. The old \"sacramentaries\" of the eighth century and later\r\nextend the word sacrament to a great variety of rites such as blessing\r\nof the holy water, dedicating churches, etc., and have prayers and\r\nbenedictions for the same. Robanus Maurus (d. 856) advocated four and\r\nPaschasius Rodbertus (d. 865) two sacraments, while Dionysius\r\nAreopagite believed in six and Peter Damiani (d. 1072) enumerated\r\ntwelve. Hugh of St. Victor (d. 1141) asserted that there were thirty,\r\nbut Peter Lombard (d. 1164) and Thomas Aquinas (1274) fixed on seven as\r\nthe number, though they were not officially adopted by the Church until\r\n1439.\r\n\r\nThe sacraments were the means of grace and spiritual food for the soul.\r\nThey met the child at birth in baptism, accompanied him in life, and\r\nclosed his eyes with extreme unction in death.\r\n\r\nThe most important of the sacraments was the eucharist. This solemn\r\nfestival seems to have been at first a regular meal, probably the\r\nprincipal meal of the day in each family, at which the commemorative\r\nbreaking of bread and partaking of the cup was a part. Subsequently,\r\nhowever, the local congregation met on this common basis. Certain abuses\r\nwhich resulted[373:1] led to the early separation of the agape, or\r\nlove-feast, from the ministration of the eucharist of the bread and\r\nwine. Henceforth the eucharist became a distinct institution celebrated\r\nsoon with solemn pomp by the priesthood alone. It was regarded as the\r\nsymbol of unity among believers and of communion with the Deity. It\r\nbecame the test of Christian fellowship and membership. In the hands of\r\nthe mediæval priesthood, it was a most effectual power, since the Church\r\ncould withhold it and thus make those deprived of it outcasts certain of\r\neternal damnation. Because of its grave importance, the Church made\r\nparticipation frequent and obligatory--and even administered it to\r\ninfants and to the dead. In the early Church the eucharist was\r\ncelebrated every Lord's Day and on the anniversaries of the martyrs.\r\nLater it was offered every day and after the time of Leo the Great\r\nseveral times a day as a daily sacrifice for daily sins. The celebration\r\nof the eucharist was called the mass--the culmination of all Christian\r\nworship--to which, however, only those fully initiated into Church\r\nmembership were admitted.[374:1]\r\n\r\nBaptism was likewise a very important sacrament. Although there is no\r\nevidence that Jesus ever performed the rite, still the New Testament\r\nshows that the Apostles and evangelists did.[374:2] Immersion and\r\nsprinkling were both early employed. The priest of course performed the\r\nrite, though in cases of urgency any person using the proper formula\r\ncould do so. The effects produced by baptism were: regeneration; the\r\ninfusion of sanctifying grace; the gifts of faith, hope, and charity;\r\nthe remission of all sin, both original and actual, and also of all\r\npenalty due to sin, both temporal and eternal. Because of the great\r\nefficacy and the indelible character imparted by this sacrament, also\r\nits absolute necessity to salvation, it was common for catechumens to\r\npostpone the rite until the end of life drew near--as did Constantine\r\nthe Great--for then it would wipe away all past records. Elaborate\r\nceremonies in connection with baptism early developed. Candidates for\r\nthe rite, called catechumens, were forced to undergo a long course of\r\ninstruction. They could not witness the mysteries of the eucharist, but\r\nwere dismissed after the response and genuflections. After baptism,\r\nwhich was administered usually on great Church festivals, especially\r\nWhitsunday, the catechumens were received, given Christian name, turned\r\nto the west to renounce the \"devil and his works,\" exorcised by the\r\npriest, anointed with holy oil, and instructed in the fundamentals of\r\nChristian doctrine. Often an entire day was consumed in these\r\nceremonies. The act of baptism with consecrated water was performed at\r\nthe entrance to the church and usually the baptised received a white\r\ngarment in token of his purity.[375:1] Beautiful baptisteries were early\r\nbuilt either within the church or very near to the entrance.\r\n\r\nIn the Apostolic Church baptism was invariably connected with the\r\nimposition of hands.[375:2] Later, however, the two acts were separated.\r\nThe laying on of hands in point of time came soon after the rite of\r\nbaptism.[375:3] All priests could baptise, while only the bishops could\r\nperform the ceremony which gradually developed into the sacrament of\r\nconfirmation. The permanent separation of baptism and confirmation did\r\nnot occur, it seems, until the thirteenth century. The rite of baptism\r\nwas ordinarily performed only in special baptismal churches and at\r\ncertain stated periods. In popular opinion the baptised were placed\r\nunder the protection and consecration of the divine power. The rite also\r\nsignified subjection to the Church.\r\n\r\nPenance was a sacrament and a pronounced institution of the Church of\r\nthe Middle Ages. The New Testament has in it but little on the subject\r\nof discipline.[376:1] In the early Church penance was exclusively\r\nspiritual, was not compulsory but had to be sought, occurred but once,\r\nwas extended only to baptised communicants, always followed public\r\nconfession before the whole congregation, and varied with the offence.\r\nThe penitents removed all ornaments from their persons, dressed in\r\nsackcloth, the men shaved their heads and faces and the women wore\r\ndishevelled hair, put ashes on their heads, abstained from baths and all\r\nnormal pleasures, and lived on bread and water. They were divided into\r\nfour classes: (1) The weepers, who could only stand at the church doors\r\nand beg for prayers. (2) The hearers, who could enter the church for the\r\nscripture lesson, but had to leave before the eucharistic service began.\r\n(3) The kneelers, who could witness the first part of the eucharistic\r\noffice and then departed with the catechumens. (4) The standers, who\r\ncould remain during the whole service but were not permitted to\r\ncommunicate.\r\n\r\nOut of these earlier conditions, penance came to be regarded as a\r\nsacrament instituted by Jesus for removing sins committed after baptism\r\nbut involving contrition of heart and private confession to a priest as\r\nprerequisites,[376:2] and for the performance of good works, such as\r\nfasting, almsgiving, pilgrimages, endowing institutions of the Church,\r\nself-flagellation, etc. The priest then solemnly absolved the penitent.\r\nThe Middle Ages produced regular \"penitential books,\"[376:3] that is, a\r\ncode of penalties for sins like drunkenness, fornications, avarice,\r\nperjury, murder, heresy, idolatry, and other crimes. These regulations\r\nwere compiled from the Church Fathers, the Church synods and councils\r\ndown to the seventh century, and other collections of authoritative\r\nsources. Nearly every diocese had its own special penitential code, but\r\nthe general character and spirit were essentially the same all over the\r\nChurch. Out of the system of penance grew the practice of indulgences,\r\nwhich was simply the substitution of a payment in money for the penance.\r\nArchbishop Theodore of Canterbury is usually credited with originating\r\nthe principle of penance and the institution of indulgences,[377:1] but\r\nthe system did not gain prominence until the time of the\r\nCrusades.[377:2]\r\n\r\nOrdination was the sacrament of the hierarchy by which baptised persons\r\nwere consecrated to perform the duties of priesthood. Like baptism it\r\nconferred an indelible character, hence could not be repeated. The\r\nsacrament of extreme unction was at first merely the use of consecrated\r\noil to heal the sick.[377:3] But before long such veneration was\r\nbestowed upon the holy oil that as early as the fourth century people\r\nbroke into the churches and stole the oil out of the lamps in order to\r\nuse it for the working of miraculous cures. It was employed not alone by\r\nthe priests, but by all Christians. It did not really become a sacrament\r\nuntil the time of Peter Lombard. Marriage was also held to be a\r\nsacrament, through which the priesthood controlled legitimacy,\r\ninheritance, and the validity of wills.\r\n\r\nOut of pagan idolatry, hero-worship, and the veneration for the martyrs\r\nof the early Church grew both the practice of saint-worship and the use\r\nof relics. The day of the martyr's death was made a festival and the\r\nplace of his burial was sanctified. It was believed that the martyrs had\r\nthe power to intercede with the Divine Powers for the answer of prayers.\r\nChurches and shrines were built over the tombs of the martyrs, or their\r\nbones were carried into churches. These relics were thought to possess\r\nmiracle-working power. Those places not blessed with relics felt it to\r\nbe a great disadvantage, consequently imported the remains of martyrs\r\nand saints to meet the need. Regular calendars of saints appeared and\r\nchildren were named after them with the expectation of lifelong\r\nprotection and assistance from the patron.\r\n\r\nBy the fourth century it was believed that the blessed martyrs, through\r\ncommunion with our Lord, shared in his attributes of omnipresence and\r\nomniscience. Prayers in behalf of the saints changed to prayers to them\r\nfor help. This transition was particularly easy for those who were won\r\nfrom paganism because they were already accustomed to similar practices.\r\nA festival of All Saints was instituted by Pope Boniface IV. in 610,\r\nwhen the Pantheon was dedicated as a Christian church, though it was not\r\ncommonly observed until the ninth century, when Louis the Pious made it\r\ngeneral in the Empire. The festival of All Souls supplemented it in the\r\ntenth century and became very popular. Every day in the calendar was\r\ndedicated to one saint or more. Down to the tenth century individuals\r\nrenowned for some pious deed or for some suffering on account of the\r\nChristian faith were exalted to sainthood by the voice of the people\r\nwith the consent of the bishop. Later, however, the bishops nominated\r\nthe saints and the Pope conferred the honour. The first instance of\r\npapal canonisation was that of Ulrich, the Bishop of Augsburg, by John\r\nXV. in 973. Pope Alexander III. (1170), in the period when the Papacy\r\nwas becoming all-powerful, seized this great prerogative into his own\r\nhands.[379:1] Each nation, district, city, and individual church had its\r\nsaint. The fame of the saints was perpetuated by legend, hymn, painting,\r\nsculpture, and the sacred edifices built to their memory and honour.\r\nConsequently the tales and beliefs connected with the saints produced\r\nmost of the literature of the Middle Ages--the poetry, the song, the\r\nhistory, and the subject of common thought, conversation, and feeling.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with saint-worship was the universal use of sacred\r\nrelics and a belief in their miraculous power. The dominant interest of\r\npopular piety circles around the saints and their relics. The relics in\r\nthe church were the greatest treasure of the community, and the\r\nreliquary was the choicest ornament of the private room of the lady, in\r\nthe knight's armory, in the king's hall, and in the bishop's palace. The\r\nuse of relics and images developed comparatively early in the life of\r\nthe Church.[379:2] By the time of Constantine the practice was common\r\nand approved by the Fathers. In fact, so wild were the people of the\r\nWest for relics that imperial law had to prohibit the cutting of the\r\ncorpses of martyrs into pieces for sale.[380:1] The great Ambrose\r\nrefused to consecrate a church which had no relics. When the Pantheon\r\nwas dedicated by Pope Boniface IV. twenty-eight cartloads of bones of\r\nmartyrs were transferred to that building from the various\r\ncemeteries.[380:2] The seventh œcumenical council of Nicæa (787)\r\nforbade bishops to dedicate a church without sacred relics under penalty\r\nof excommunication. Traffic in relics became a regular business. St.\r\nAugustine reproved the wandering monks for selling bogus relics. Gregory\r\nthe Great refused to send relics of St. Paul to the Empress of\r\nConstantinople, yet he very jealously distributed the filings of the\r\nchain of St. Peter. The relics increased until western Europe was full\r\nof them and every community had miracle-working wonders--the products of\r\nexcessive piety, fraud, and credulity. All Christians believed in relics\r\nfor it was an impious thing to doubt. The wood of the true cross \"grew\r\ninto a forest\"; the nails were very numerous; at Sens was found the rod\r\nof Moses; at Aachen the swaddling clothes of Jesus; at other points a\r\nfeather plucked from the wing of the angel Gabriel, the tears of Jesus,\r\nthe milk of the Virgin, the emblems of the Passion, a piece of wood from\r\nthe temple which St. Peter intended to build on the Mount of Olives; and\r\nthe bones, hair, teeth, and garments of saints without number. These\r\nrelics were employed to convert the heathen,[380:3] to heal diseases, to\r\nward off danger,[380:4] to punish the wicked, to protect the innocent,\r\nand to bring good luck and general blessing.\r\n\r\nThe worship of Mary the Mother of Jesus became very pronounced after\r\nthe fourth century. Tertullian put Eve and Mary alongside of Adam and\r\nJesus. She was called the Blessed Virgin and the Mother of God. The\r\nfestival of the Annunciation held in the fifth century soon led to the\r\nfestival of the Purification of Mary, or the Candlemas of Mary. About\r\nthe end of the sixth century developed the feast of the Ascension of\r\nMary, to be followed the next century by the celebration of the birthday\r\nof Mary. High above all the saints and martyrs was the rapturous\r\nadoration of the \"Queen of Heaven.\" After Gregory the Great the Virgin\r\nplayed a constantly increasing part in the Church of the West. Churches\r\nwere erected in her honour everywhere and every church had at least a\r\nchapel consecrated to Our Lady.\r\n\r\nHell, heaven, and purgatory were very real indeed to the mediæval mind.\r\nTheir location, form, and inhabitants were known exactly through\r\nmediæval credulity. Devils and angels were in constant communication in\r\none way or another with the inhabitants of earth. All these forces and\r\ninfluences formed the mediæval mind and produced the mediæval\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nA.--PRIMARY:\r\n\r\n  1.--The Church Fathers. See Chap.

II.--Preparations to restore the Empire on a\r\n     German basis. III.--Otto the Great creates the Holy Roman\r\n     Empire. IV.--Holy Roman Empire attains its height under Henry\r\n     III. V.--Results of the creation of the Holy Roman Empire.\r\n     VI.--Sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Empire created by Charles the Great rapidly declined under the later\r\nCarolingians. The causes for this dissolution were:\r\n\r\n1. The principle of division of rule, which was practised before the\r\ntime of Charles the Great, and endorsed by him, produced five divisions\r\nof the Empire within thirty years. This was fatal to stability and\r\npermanency.\r\n\r\n2. The disintegration of the Empire into national states resulted from\r\nthe growing differences of race, language, institutions, and\r\nlaws.[384:1]\r\n\r\n3. Powerful feudal dukedoms arose such as Bavaria on the Danube, the\r\nbarrier against the East; Swabia on the upper Danube and Rhine;\r\nFranconia on the Rhine and Main north of Swabia; Saxony on the Ems,\r\nWeser, and Elbe north of Franconia; Burgundy, a kingdom south-west of\r\nSwabia; Aquitania in southern France; Brittany in north-western France;\r\nNormandy in northern France; and others.\r\n\r\n4. The rulers who succeeded Charles the Great were, as compared with\r\nhim, men of very inferior ability.\r\n\r\n5. The poor roads made it almost impossible to keep in touch with all\r\nparts of the wide Empire. The well-built roads of the Romans had\r\ngenerally fallen into decay, simply because there was no longer a corps\r\nof trained engineers to keep them up.\r\n\r\n6. The scarcity of money likewise prevented the ruler from securing the\r\nservices of a great body of able officers, and also made it impossible\r\nfor him to support a standing army to enforce his will everywhere.\r\n\r\n7. The barbarian invasions from the east and the north brought in the\r\nNorthmen, Slavs, and the Hungarians, while the Saracens were attacking\r\nItaly and southern France.[385:1]\r\n\r\nBefore the ninth century closed, the territorial unity of the Empire of\r\nCharles the Great was broken up. Charles the Bald (875-877) ruled France\r\nas king, held Italy as Emperor, and sought to gain control of Germany\r\nbut was prevented by death from doing so. Charles the Fat (881-888) held\r\nGermany as king, controlled Italy as Emperor, and was invited to assume\r\nthe French crown because Charles the Simple, a weak-minded boy of six,\r\ncould not cope with the marauding Northmen. Charles the Fat, the last\r\nlegitimate East Frankish male descendant of Charles the Great, accepted\r\nthe proffered throne (885) and thus reunited all the parts of the Empire\r\nof Charles the Great except Burgundy. But Charles the Fat was too weak\r\nto hold the reins of government over so vast an area. He bought off the\r\nNorthmen by a disgraceful treaty (886) to the disgust of the French, was\r\ndriven out of Italy (887), and then, deposed and deserted by his German\r\nsubjects, he crawled off to an unregrettable death on his Swabian\r\nestates (888).[386:1] This was the last union of France and Germany\r\nunder one ruler until Napoleon the Great carved out his vast Empire in\r\nwestern Europe.\r\n\r\nWhen the line of the Carolingian rulers, called into existence by papal\r\ncoronation in 800, ended with the death of the last legitimate\r\ndescendant in the male line, Charles the Fat, in 888, a new problem\r\nconfronted western Europe. The right of appointing a new Emperor\r\nreverted to Rome and the Pope. The Empire of Charles the Great fell\r\nasunder and from it emerged four kingdoms.[386:2] West France chose Odo\r\nof Eudes as king. East France, or Germany, elected Arnulf. The kingdom\r\nof Burgundy was divided between two rival rulers. Italy, except the\r\nsouthern part which was still loyal to Constantinople, was also divided\r\nbetween the parties of Berengar of Friuli[386:3] and Guido of\r\nSpoleto.[386:4] The former was chosen king by the estates of Lombardy,\r\nthe latter was crowned Emperor by the Pope Stephen VI. and not long\r\nafterwards, to insure the permanency of the imperial title in his\r\nfamily, had his son Lambert crowned co-Emperor in 894 by Pope\r\nFormosus.[386:5]\r\n\r\nOf all the various knights who appeared in different parts of the\r\nEmpire immediately after 888, the strongest and most able was Arnulf, a\r\nbastard nephew of Charles the Fat, but a warrior of renown, who was\r\nraised on the East Frankish throne by the disgusted nobles in 888. A\r\ndescendant of Charles the Great, he was, for a very brief period, looked\r\nupon as the head of the Carolingian Empire. Odo of Eudes, the Count of\r\nParis, placed his royal crown in the hands of Arnulf and received it\r\nback as a royal vassal. Berengar of Italy also did homage to Arnulf and\r\nreceived his kingdom as a fief. Soon, however, local kings set up by the\r\npeople arose and Arnulf restricted his rule to Germany and Italy.[387:1]\r\nHe defeated the predatory Northmen, checked the inroads of the warlike\r\nMagyars, and by storming Rome compelled the Corsican Pope Formosus to\r\ncrown him as Emperor (896).[387:2] Then he turned his attention to the\r\nboy Emperor in Italy, the Duke of Spoleto, but was smitten by disease\r\nand hastened back to Germany (d. 899).[387:3] Italy was thus left to\r\nsixty years of tumult and anarchy. With the death of his son, Louis the\r\nChild, in 911, the Carolingian dynasty passed away in Germany. In 987\r\nthe powerful French barons set aside the Carolingian heir and elected\r\nHugh Capet, the Duke of France, as king of the feudal monarchy and the\r\nArchbishop of Rheims crowned him.[387:4] The Carolingian Empire was at\r\nan end. For more than half a century now the imperial crown was a\r\nreward in the Pope's hands to be bestowed upon this or that Italian\r\nnoble for \"value received.\"[388:1]\r\n\r\nThe first half of the tenth century seemed to be the very nadir of\r\npolitical order and conscious culture. It is almost impossible for a\r\nmodern mind to comprehend the torrents of barbaric destruction sweeping\r\nin over western Europe from all sides. As compared with the Teutonic\r\ninvasion of the Roman Empire five centuries before, the onslaught was\r\nmore sudden and fiercer while the internal resistance was much more\r\npoorly organised and consequently weaker. For several centuries these\r\nforces had been gathering. Charles the Great had held the torrent in\r\ncheck. But not long after the dissolution of his Empire the onslaught\r\nbegan. The merciless Saracens roamed the Mediterranean Sea as its\r\nmasters, laid waste the Christian seacoast towns, and even sacked Rome\r\nitself, the seat of Empire and Christian rule. The Danes and Northmen\r\nswept the North Sea, the English Channel, the Atlantic coast, and\r\npierced France and Germany by their rivers, almost to the heart,\r\nkilling, robbing, and taking captives. They even boldly passed Gibraltar\r\ninto the Mediterranean and fell upon Provence and Italy, where they left\r\nan indelible impression.\r\n\r\nMeantime on land the Slavic barbarians, the Wends, the Czechs, and the\r\nObotrites, rebelled against the German yoke and threatened the whole\r\nnorth-eastern border of the Empire. Behind them were the Poles and\r\nRussians. Farther south came the unruly Hungarian tribes which \"dashed\r\nover Germany like the flying spray of a new wave of barbarism, and\r\ncarried the terror of the battle-axes to the Apennines and the\r\nocean.\"[389:1] These blows from all sides knocked out the foundations of\r\nthe imperial structure, already weakened to the point of dissolution by\r\ninternal decay, and it fell. As a result reliance for protection on a\r\ncommon defence and imperial organisation was abandoned. Feudalism\r\nreplaced the Empire. The strong built fortress castles, the weak became\r\ntheir vassals. Local authorities--counts, dukes, lords, bishops, and\r\nabbots--saw new duties and new opportunities. They took a firmer hold,\r\nconverted a delegated into an independent power, a personal into a\r\nterritorial jurisdiction. Recognition of a distant, weak imperial or\r\nroyal authority was only nominal and feeble at that. The grand dream of\r\na mighty, universal Christian Empire was being rapidly lost in the\r\ndecentralising forces, and in the increasing localisation of all powers.\r\nDuring this period of weakness and confusion, the mediæval Church,\r\ninstead of standing forth as the source of strength and intelligence,\r\ninstead of making further gains of a political and ecclesiastical\r\ncharacter for the See of St. Peter, seemed to fall into \"a death-sleep\r\nof moral and spiritual exhaustion.\"[389:2] The Papacy as a religious\r\norganisation almost disappears from view. The commanding spirits of\r\nGregory the Great and of Nicholas the Great were utterly forgotten. The\r\nvictories gained through the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals were not\r\nfollowed up. A really great Pope at this time might easily have realised\r\nall the dreams of Innocent III., but none such wore the papal tiara.\r\n\r\nWith the death of Louis the Child (911), Germany was confronted by a\r\nserious problem.[390:1] Would the powerful German dukes set up\r\nindependent kingdoms? Or would they invite Charles the Simple, the\r\ngenuine Carolingian sovereign of France, to include Germany in a\r\nreunited Frankish empire? Or would they create a German monarchy on an\r\nindependent basis? The German nobles met at Forchheim to consider the\r\nsituation. Charles the Simple was not even thought of--a significant\r\nfact, because it showed that the imperial idea was at a low ebb in\r\nGermany. The instinct of nationality was beginning to be felt. The\r\nnobles urged the beloved and honoured old Duke of Saxony, Otto, to\r\naccept the crown of a feudal monarchy, but he declined and urged the\r\nelection of Conrad of Franconia. Conrad accepted the responsible honour\r\nand was crowned and anointed by the Archbishop of Mainz without\r\nreference to the papal power. His reign (911-918) was filled with wars\r\nagainst the powerful dukes who objected to the rigid enforcement of his\r\nroyal rights and the consequent curtailment of their prerogatives. The\r\nclergy, on the contrary, upheld the king because they clearly saw that\r\ntheir interests would be best cared for by a simple, strong government.\r\nWhen Conrad died (918) he had made little headway toward the creation of\r\na powerful centralised monarchy.[390:2]\r\n\r\nThe nobles of Saxony and Franconia met in 919 and chose Henry, the son\r\nof Conrad, Duke of Saxony, as king (919-936).[390:3] To the Archbishop\r\nof Mainz, who wanted to crown him, Henry said: \"Enough for me that I am\r\nraised so far above my sires as to be chosen and called king through\r\nthe grace of God and your devotion; let the sacred unction and crown be\r\nfor better men than I.\" Had he seen too much of kings crowned and ruled\r\nby priests? At least his action pleased the whole assembly. By wise\r\nconcessions he forced Swabia and Bavaria to accept him as king and rewon\r\nLorraine as a part of the German kingdom. He thrust back the terrible\r\nMagyars, conquered the Danes, and humbled the Bohemians. He reformed and\r\nreorganised the military system and protected the kingdom by building\r\nfortified towns along the northern and eastern frontiers. When he died\r\nall the German people were under one rule, peace reigned throughout the\r\nkingdom, feudalism had received a check, trade was flourishing, the\r\nposition of the freemen was improved, and the German kingdom had been\r\nestablished on a firm basis independent of the Empire. But death alone,\r\nperhaps, prevented him from claiming the imperial crown.[391:1]\r\n\r\nUnder Otto the Great, however, the old Empire was to revive and become\r\nvery active, but on a German foundation. The traditions of the\r\nCarolingian house, the Italian puppet Emperors, the Papacy, and the law,\r\nphilosophy, theology, and education of the day all helped to keep the\r\nidea of Empire alive.[391:2] Otto, born in 912, was the son of the Saxon\r\nking Henry I. and Matilda, who traced her descent to Charles the Great.\r\nHe spent his youth at the court and in the wars of his father, and was\r\nregarded as haughty, overbearing, and ambitious. He married Edith, the\r\ndaughter of the King of the Anglo-Saxons (929).\r\n\r\nWhen Henry I. died in 936 the nobles and bishops met at Aachen in the\r\nold cathedral and formally elected Otto I. as King of Germany. As Otto\r\nentered the cathedral a few weeks later to be coronated the Archbishop\r\nof Mainz cried out: \"The man chosen by God, nominated by our master\r\nHenry, and declared king by all the princes.\" He was then crowned,\r\nanointed, and girded with the royal sword by the Archbishop. In the\r\ncoronation festival that followed the German dukes for the first time\r\nacted as the king's servants. The coronation was very significant\r\nbecause it showed Otto's attitude toward the Church, indicated the lofty\r\nposition of the royal crown and the subjection of the dukes, revealed\r\nthe possibility of a strong, united German kingdom under right\r\nmanagement, and proved the popularity and opportunity of Otto I. as King\r\nof the Germans.[392:1]\r\n\r\nOtto took Charles the Great as his model and sought to transform the\r\nloose federal state of his father into a strong, compact monarchy by\r\nreducing the power of his vassals. By quelling the various rebellious\r\ndukes Otto made them his own appointees, and was recognised as the\r\nmaster of the German nation. The name \"Deutsch\" began to be applied to\r\nhis subjects and their tongue. He manifested no less activity in foreign\r\naffairs as is shown in his invasion of France to compel homage from Hugh\r\nthe Great, his son-in-law; in his conquest of the Slavs between the Elbe\r\nand the Oder; and in his reduction of the unstable Danes to submission.\r\n\r\nOtto was ready now to give his attention to Italian affairs. Adelaide,\r\nthe beautiful young widow of the son of King Hugh of Provence, had\r\nrefused to marry Adalbert, the son of Berengar II., King of Lombardy,\r\nhence was cast into prison and cruelly treated. She escaped with the\r\naid of the Bishop of Reggio and appealed to the mighty German sovereign\r\nfor deliverance.[393:1] Otto, touched with chivalrous sympathy, and\r\nseeing an opening for the realisation of imperial ambitions, marched\r\nwith a great force into Lombardy (951). Berengar was forced to hold his\r\nkingdom as a vassal of the German crown. Otto, a widower at this time,\r\nthen married his fair protégée. Civil war in Germany compelled him to\r\ngive up his journey to Rome, however, and instead to return home. Otto's\r\nson, Ludolph, who feared that his father's recent marriage with the fair\r\nwidow might deprive him of the German crown, plotted with the old\r\nArchbishop of Mainz and discontented German nobles, to secure the\r\nthrone. The resulting war involved the whole kingdom and shook Otto's\r\npower and ability to the roots. The approach of a common foe, however,\r\nthe terrible Magyars, led the nation to rally around Otto. In the\r\ndecisive battle of Lechfeld (955) the Huns were effectively checked and\r\nbegan to settle the lands which they still occupy.[393:2] Otto was now\r\nunquestionably the most powerful monarch in Europe. Such rulers as Louis\r\nIV. of France and the King of Burgundy sought his friendship and aid.\r\nHis own people began to call him \"The Great.\"\r\n\r\nThe way seemed to be open at last for the realisation of Otto's imperial\r\ndreams. He was a descendant of Charles the Great in the female line. He\r\nwas the complete master of a large part of the Empire with the northern\r\ncapital in it. He had already taken the crown of Lombardy. On the\r\nbattlefield of Lechfeld (955) his victorious troops saluted him as\r\n\"Imperator Augustus, Pater Patræ.\"[394:1] He had likewise proved himself\r\na most worthy champion of the Church by allowing the Church to crown\r\nhim; by enriching the German Church, giving it a better organisation,\r\nand subjecting it to his will; and by labouring zealously to convert the\r\nheathen on his borders.[394:2]\r\n\r\nItalian affairs called him thither a second time. Berengar after\r\nrecovering his throne was ruling as a tyrant in the north and had\r\nviolated a portion of the patrimony of St. Peter. Mohammedan corsairs\r\nwere devastating the south. The rest of Italy was full of anarchy and\r\ndesolated by the feuds of a crowd of petty nobles most of whom were\r\nscrambling for the imperial crown. A row of inferior Popes had brought\r\nthe Papacy itself into disrepute. Thus the solicitations of his family,\r\nthe approval of his people and nobles, the cry of the oppressed\r\nItalians, the expectation of the nobility, and the request of Pope John\r\nXII. and influential churchmen, all impelled him to realise his own\r\nwish.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in 957, Otto sent Ludolph with a large force against\r\nBerengar. The Crown Prince died in the midst of victory. Then Otto had\r\nhis little son crowned as Otto II. in 961 and crossed the Alps with a\r\nbig army. All resistance vanished before this new Charles the Great. In\r\na general diet of the Lombard kingdom Berengar was deposed and at Pavia\r\nthe German monarch was formally crowned \"King of Italy.\" Early in 962 he\r\ntriumphantly entered the Eternal City. The Pope gave him hearty\r\ngreeting, held services of thanksgiving, and gave a great feast in his\r\nhonour. On the following Sunday the imperial coronation occurred in the\r\nchurch of St. John Lateran.[395:1] The King promised to protect and\r\ndefend the Church[395:2]; the Pope to be an obedient subject of the\r\nEmperor; and the people to choose no future Pope without Otto's consent.\r\nOtto was then anointed by the Pope, the imperial crown was put on his\r\nbrow, the imperial robe was adjusted, and the imperial sword was buckled\r\non while the populace shouted \"Long live Otto, Emperor Augustus.\" The\r\nhead of that race which Charles the Great had converted by the sword had\r\nrevived the Empire, the policy, and the traditions of that renowned\r\nruler.\r\n\r\nThe papal policy of Emperor Otto I. was soon revealed. He granted to the\r\nChurch the most famous and the most important \"constitution\" since that\r\nof Lothair (824) in which all the grants of Pepin, Charles the Great,\r\nand Louis the Pious were confirmed and the rights of the Emperor in\r\npapal elections clearly defined.[395:3] Otto had no sooner reached\r\nnorthern Italy to subdue the irrepressible Berengar and his sons,\r\nhowever, than Pope John renounced his allegiance to his new master,\r\nconspired with Berengar, and even incited the heathen Magyars to invade\r\nGermany.[395:4] The Emperor refused to believe these plots until\r\nconfirmed by his own messengers and even then excused the young Pontiff\r\nby remarking: \"He is only a boy; the example of good men will reform\r\nhim.\"[395:5] He then hastened to Rome to begin that work.\r\n\r\nPope John at once sent legates to Otto promising amendment and accusing\r\nthe Emperor of having broken his solemn promise. Otto excused his\r\nactions and, after the custom of the age, challenged the Pope to settle\r\nthe dispute either by the wager of a solemn oath or by the ordeal of\r\nbattle. Both offers were refused and Otto took Rome. John \"seized most\r\nof the treasures of St. Peter and sought safety in flight.\"[396:1] Otto,\r\nat the request of the Roman clergy and people, called an ecclesiastical\r\ncouncil in St. Peter's to try him (963). John XII. was proved guilty of\r\nthe whole category of mediæval crimes: celebrating mass without\r\ncommuning himself, ordaining a bishop in a stable, accepting bribes for\r\nordination, consecrating a ten-year-old bishop, neglecting the repair of\r\nchurches, being guilty of adultery and incest, making the Lateran a\r\nbrothel, going out hunting with the nobles, putting out the eyes of his\r\nown godfather, Benedict, cruelly murdering the archdeacon John, setting\r\nfire to houses like Nero, wearing the armour of a warrior in Rome,\r\ndrinking to the devil's health, neglecting matins and vespers, never\r\nsigning himself with the cross, and even invoking the aid of Venus,\r\nJupiter, and other demons when gambling.\r\n\r\nThrice John was summoned to appear before the council in order to clear\r\nhimself of the charges. At the request of the council the Emperor wrote\r\na letter addressed to the \"Pontiff and Universal Pope John\" asking him\r\nto appear:\r\n\r\n     Having arrived in Rome on the service of God, and having\r\n     inquired of your sons the bishops and clergy, and of the\r\n     people of your Church, why you have forsaken them, such\r\n     scandalous and obscene things have been reported to us\r\n     concerning you, that if the like had been told us of a common\r\n     mountebank we should have hesitated to repeat them. But that\r\n     you may not be wholly ignorant of what it is that is said of\r\n     you, we will specify a few of these things only; for if we\r\n     would enumerate all, the daylight would fail before we would\r\n     make an end of writing. Know, then, that you are accused--not\r\n     by individuals but by the unanimous voice of clergy and\r\n     laity--of homicide, sacrilege, perjury, and incest. It is also\r\n     said of you, that in your sports you have called upon the\r\n     names of Jupiter, Venus, and other demons of the old world. We\r\n     therefore do earnestly entreat your paternity that you delay\r\n     not to return to Rome, and to purge yourself from these\r\n     heinous crimes, and if perchance you should stand in fear of\r\n     the rude multitude, we are ready to pledge our oath that\r\n     nothing contrary to canonical rule and order shall be done\r\n     against you.[397:1]\r\n\r\nBut the fiery young Pope contemptuously replied: \"John, bishop, the\r\nservant of all the servants of God, to all the bishops: We hear that you\r\ndesign to elect a new Pope. If you do, in the name of Almighty God I\r\nexcommunicate you and forbid you to confer orders or to celebrate mass.\"\r\nIn a spicy answer Otto asked John to mend both his Latin and his morals,\r\nand promised him a safe conduct to the council, but \"the Pope was gone\r\nout hunting\" and did not receive it. The council then formally deposed\r\nJohn as a \"monster of iniquity\" and unanimously chose the papal\r\nsecretary, a layman, as Pope Leo VIII.[397:2] Thus the new Emperor had\r\ndeposed one Pope, by what must certainly be pronounced an illegal\r\nmethod, and had elected another--a power never claimed by Charles the\r\nGreat.[398:1] This, apparently, was Otto's interpretation of his oath to\r\nprotect the Holy See. The ancient relation of the Empire to the Papacy\r\nwas thus re-established.\r\n\r\nThe Romans, fickle as usual, soon wearied of a German yoke, and, at a\r\nfavourable opportunity, broke out in furious rebellion against the\r\nEmperor and his Pope, but were subdued with terrible revenge. When at\r\nlength Otto left Rome to capture Berengar's son Adalbert, they at once\r\nattacked the defenceless Pope and recalled John XII., who wreaked sweet\r\nand cruel vengeance on the leaders of the imperial faction. An\r\nobsequious synod reversed all the decrees of deposition. When John XII.\r\nwas killed in crime, the Romans, without consulting the Emperor as they\r\nhad promised, at once elected Pope Benedict V. Once more Otto appeared\r\nbefore Rome with a huge army to assert his rights and to enforce his\r\npolicy. The city surrendered, the new Pope begged for mercy, and was\r\nbanished to Germany. Leo VIII. was recalled. \"When I drop my sword, I\r\nwill drop Leo,\" boasted the Emperor. The Emperor's sword had come to be\r\nthe basis of papal power. A Church council was summoned and declared\r\nthat the Emperor had a full right to the kingdom of Italy, that he could\r\nname his successor, and that the election of a Pope must accord with his\r\nwill. After that great victory Otto returned to Germany, where his\r\napproval was soon asked for the election of Leo VIII.'s successor, the\r\nrespectable John XIII. Again the customary rebellion against the new\r\noccupant of St. Peter's chair recalled Otto to Rome. There he remained\r\nfive years and won a distinct victory for both his papal, and his\r\nimperial policy.\r\n\r\nOtto's foreign policy as Emperor was not unlike that of his great\r\npredecessor, Charles the Great, and his renowned successor, Napoleon the\r\nGreat, namely, to unite the East and the West. The hand of an eastern\r\nprincess was wooed for himself but without success.[399:1] His son\r\nproved a better lover and married the ambitious Theophano (972).[399:2]\r\nThe Empire was extended by conquests. Lotharingia was won without war.\r\nThe restoration of the West Franks to the Empire was attempted. Burgundy\r\nbecame a vassal kingdom.[399:3] The Danes, Slavs, and Magyars were held\r\nin subjugation. An effort was made by Otto to extend his sway over\r\nsouthern Italy.\r\n\r\nLike Charles the Great, Otto gave considerable attention to education.\r\nGermany, at that time being on the frontier, was inferior in culture to\r\nItaly, Spain, France, and England. Otto, who knew the Frankish and\r\nSlavic dialects, attempted to learn Latin late in life. He attracted a\r\nnumber of educated men and celebrated wits to his court such as\r\nWidukind, the historian; Ratherius, the theologian; Luitprand, the\r\nhumourist and diplomat; Gerbert, the omniscient scholar; Archbishop\r\nBruno, Otto's brother and a great classical scholar; and John of Gorz,\r\nthe grammarian and Bible student.[399:4] Learning was not appreciated,\r\nhowever, and these scholars were looked upon with jealousy and\r\nsuspicion.[399:5]\r\n\r\nThe resemblances and differences between Otto the Great and Charles the\r\nGreat were very striking. Both were Teutons--one a Frank, the other a\r\nSaxon. Both as kings carved out the foundations for an Empire with the\r\nsword. Both were coronated as Emperor at Rome by the Pope and posed as\r\nchampions of the Church. Both assumed the Italian crown. Both used the\r\nsame method in propagating Christianity among the heathen on their\r\nborders. Both assumed the right to rule the Church from Pope to priest.\r\nBoth subjected the powerful nobles and established an absolute, personal\r\ngovernment, though Otto's position in Germany and Europe was less\r\ncommanding and less autocratic than his predecessor's. Both produced an\r\nintellectual renascence. Both deserve to be called the \"Great.\" But\r\nneither their kingdoms nor their Empires were coterminous, though their\r\ncapitals were identical, namely, Rome and Aachen. Otto's Empire was\r\nfounded on narrower geographical limits, hence had a less plausible\r\nclaim to be the heir of Rome's universal dominion. Charles tried one\r\nPope, while Otto deposed two and had his own candidates elected. Otto\r\ntook more pains to preserve his Empire than Charles. Otto's Empire was\r\nless ecclesiastical and also less Roman. Charles ruled all the Franks\r\nand Italy, Otto only the Eastern Franks and Italy. Charles ruled over\r\nLatin Christendom, while Otto only a portion of it. Charles was head of\r\nthe \"heerban\"; Otto of a feudal state. Otto produced no great\r\ncapitularies like Charles. Otto's Empire was less splendid, but more\r\npeaceful, prosperous, and lasting, because placed on a better social\r\nbasis. Otto's own life and court were on a far loftier plane than was\r\ntrue of Charles, yet Charles was both the greater warrior and the\r\ngreater statesman. The Roman Empire of Charles after one hundred and\r\nfifty years was revised as the Holy Roman Empire of Otto. The latter was\r\nsubstantially as well as technically the continuation of the former.\r\n\r\nOtto I., before making his journey to Rome in 961, had his son Otto II.\r\ncrowned King of Germany at Aachen.[401:1] Six years later (967) he was\r\ncoronated at Rome as Emperor. He was educated by Ekkehard of St. Gall,\r\nthe court chaplain, in literature, history, and science, and by Count\r\nHuodo in knightly accomplishments. For the age his moral character was\r\nexceptionally high and he possessed refined, scholarly tastes. In 971 he\r\nmarried Theophano, a royal princess of the Eastern Empire.[401:2] When\r\nOtto I. died in 973 in the Saxon monastery at Memleben, Otto II., at the\r\nage of eighteen, became sole king and Emperor for ten years.\r\n\r\nOtto II. continued his father's domestic policy of breaking down the\r\npower of the German dukes. In foreign affairs he subdued the rebellious\r\nDanes (974), held the Bohemians in check, invaded France and took\r\nLorraine (978), subjected Poland to German rule (979), and attempted to\r\ndrive the Greeks and Saracens out of southern Italy; but his early death\r\nprevented the fulfilling of his threat to reunite Sicily with the\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nHis papal policy was a continuation of that of his father. When the\r\npapal usurper Boniface VII. imprisoned and strangled Pope John XIII. and\r\nthen fled with the Church treasures to Constantinople (974), young Otto\r\nset Benedict VII. on the chair of St. Peter and assured him a quiet\r\nreign for nine years. Upon the Pope's death (983) the youthful Emperor\r\nelevated the Bishop of Pavia to the papal throne as John XIV. When Otto\r\nII. died at the premature age of twenty-eight in Verona after \"a short\r\nand troubled reign,\"[402:1] Boniface VII. returned from the East to\r\nRome, murdered the Pope, and reassumed the papal tiara unresisted. The\r\nusurper died in eleven months, however, and then the cowardly Romans\r\navenged themselves on his dead body.[402:2]\r\n\r\nOtto II. left behind him a son of three and a very active widow. The\r\nyoung heir to the honours and burdens of the German crown and to the\r\nimperial throne likewise had his mind filled with the glorious history\r\nof Greece and the Eastern Empire by his Grecian mother. John the Greek\r\ninspired within him a love for the classics. Bernard, a German monk,\r\ngave him a monastic education which showed itself during the remainder\r\nof his life. Gerbert, a Clugniac monk, the greatest scholar of his day,\r\ntaught him history, literature, rhetoric, and science, and fired him\r\nwith a holy, ascetic zeal to become a great, just Christian Emperor.\r\n\r\nDuring Otto III.'s minority (983-996) the government was wielded by his\r\nmother Theophano (984-991) and his grandmother Adelaid (991-996). At the\r\nage of sixteen the last of the Ottomans, half Saxon and half Greek, the\r\nplaything of women, scholars, and monks, the pious young dreamer of a\r\nworld Empire, started for Rome to be crowned Emperor (996). His father\r\nhad had him elected king at Verona in 983 and coronated at Aachen. On\r\nhis way now to the Eternal City, accompanied by a coterie of German\r\nnobles and churchmen, he stopped at Pavia to receive the homage of the\r\nLombard princes. At Ravenna a messenger from the Roman clergy, senate,\r\nand people announced the death of Pope John XV. and asked Otto to name a\r\nsuccessor--a very significant fact. The young ruler appointed his cousin\r\nand court chaplain, Bruno, who became the first German Pope. Bruno was\r\nonly twenty-four, but noted for his piety, austere morals, and fiery\r\ntemper. He hastened to Rome and was installed with great joy as Gregory\r\nV. \"The news that a scion of the imperial house, a man of holiness, of\r\nwisdom and virtue, is placed upon the chair of Peter,\" wrote Abbo of\r\nFleury to a friend, \"is news more precious than gold and costly\r\nstones.\"[403:1] This was the first instance where a northerner, a\r\nGerman, was elevated to the See of St. Peter. A few weeks after the\r\npapal coronation Otto entered Rome and received the imperial crown from\r\nthe youthful Pontiff. He held a council to settle Church affairs and\r\ncalled a diet of civil authorities to settle the government and then\r\nreturned to Germany.\r\n\r\nWithin a year, however, a rebellion in Rome against Gregory V. recalled\r\nOtto III. (997). The Pope had fled to Pavia, called a council, and\r\nexcommunicated the leader of the insurrection, Crescentius. An anti-Pope\r\nhad been elected, John XVI., formerly the Emperor's teacher and a court\r\nfavourite. Otto reached Rome with a large army, caught the fleeing papal\r\nusurper, deposed him, put out his eyes, cut off his nose and ears, and\r\nsent him through the streets of Rome on an ass. Crescentius was\r\nbeheaded, and with him a dozen conspirators.[404:1] Gregory V. was\r\nrestored to his dignity only to die within a year (999). As his\r\nsuccessor Otto chose Gerbert, his old teacher, who became Sylvester II.,\r\nthe idealist and reformer.[404:2]\r\n\r\nOtto III. was occupied a great deal with dreams about a world Empire. He\r\ninherited from his mother the ambition to rule the East and from his\r\nfather the right to rule the West. His teachers inspired him with a\r\ndesire to become the Christian Emperor of the world with the Pope as his\r\nchief assistant, and coloured his whole career by giving him a monastic\r\nview of life. He made frequent visits to sacred shrines where he\r\nremained weeks at a time. In Rome he built his palace purposely beside a\r\nmonastery. The idea of a holy crusade to Jerusalem was in his mind. He\r\nfelt called upon to reform the Papacy, which he enriched by large grants\r\nand strengthened by privileges, and he selected most of his chief\r\nofficials from the churchmen. He called himself the \"servant of Jesus\r\nChrist\" and the \"servant of the Apostle.\"\r\n\r\nAfter having taken Rome and appointed two Popes, Otto attempted to put\r\nhis imperial fancies into practice. Rome was made his permanent\r\nresidence and capital from which to rule the world as \"Emperor of the\r\nRomans.\" On the Aventine a great palace was built--a thing not even\r\nthought of by Charles the Great. The ceremonies of the Byzantine court\r\nwere introduced--a long retinue of servants, an imperial guard, and a\r\nvery formal etiquette. The young ruler refused to eat with his nobles\r\nand loved to sit proudly on a gaudy throne arrayed in costly purple\r\nwhile his servants meekly satisfied every whim. He likewise aped the\r\nRoman Emperors in magnifying the office of patrician and city prefect,\r\nby calling himself \"Consul\" and by thinking of reviving the senate.\r\nDreaming of conquests beyond the seas, he appointed a naval prefect.\r\nGermany and Italy were united under one chancellor and each ruled with\r\ntroops from the other. Germany,[405:1] Lombardy, Greece, Naples, and the\r\nrest of the world were to be reduced to subject provinces of the\r\nrestored Empire. To receive the sacred sanction of his most renowned\r\npredecessor, Charles the Great, for these mighty ideas, Otto III. opened\r\nhis tomb in the cathedral at Aachen in the year 1000 and from the body\r\nof the powerful Teuton carried away holy relics.[405:2]\r\n\r\nEarly in 1000 the turbulent Romans broke out in a fresh rebellion and\r\nthe world Empire was destroyed about as easily as a child's house of\r\nblocks. Besieged for three days in his palace, Otto at last addressed\r\nthe discontented mob in these words:\r\n\r\n     Are you my Romans? For you I left my country and my friends.\r\n     For love of you I have sacrificed my Saxons and all the\r\n     Germans, my blood. I have adopted you as my sons; I have\r\n     preferred you to all. For you I have had stirred up against me\r\n     the envy and hatred of all. And now you have rejected your\r\n     father; you have destroyed my friends by a cruel death; you\r\n     have excluded me whom you should not exclude, because I will\r\n     never suffer those to be exiled from my affections whom I\r\n     embrace with paternal love.[406:1]\r\n\r\nSoon he fled from Rome never to return, and tried to raise an army in\r\nGermany but failed. The Germans refused to sacrifice their blood and\r\nwealth for a useless chimera and even threatened to elect a new king.\r\nThen he appealed to Italy for assistance, but Venice alone promised aid\r\nand that was small. Otto III.'s universal rule dwindled to the little\r\nmountain of Paterno--like Napoleon's St. Helena--and there he died in\r\n1002 in the arms of the faithful Sylvester II. at the age of 22,\r\nchildless and deserted, and his body was carried over the Alps to rest\r\nby the side of Charles the Great. And the youthful Pope survived the\r\nyoung Emperor just a twelvemonth.\r\n\r\nThe direct line of Otto the Great was at an end. Henry II., the Saint,\r\nwho was in Otto III.'s service in Rome (1001) and received the royal and\r\nimperial insignia at the young Emperor's death pending a new election,\r\nclaimed the German throne as the next in descent.[406:2] By satisfactory\r\npromises to the lay and secular princes he defeated his rivals and was\r\ncrowned German King at Mainz (1002).\r\n\r\nIn his political policy Henry II. followed in the path already formed.\r\nHe subdued the strong internal foes in Germany, pacified the\r\nneighbouring peoples, provided for the union of Burgundy with Germany,\r\nassumed the iron crown of Lombardy, and accepted the imperial crown at\r\nRome in 1014. His ecclesiastical policy was very pronounced. He was a\r\ndevout and ascetic champion of the Papacy and stood stoutly for reforms\r\nsuch as the abolition of simony, the denunciation of the marriage of\r\npriests and the correction of monastic abuses. He urged the enforcement\r\nof these necessary changes through a general council and laboured for\r\npeace. In all these endeavours he had the sincere co-operation of Pope\r\nBenedict VIII. The bishopric of Bamberg was created during this rule.\r\n\r\nConrad II. (1024-1039) aimed to build up a powerful centralised Germany\r\nand through it to rule the Empire. Though compelled to fight formidable\r\ninternal conspiracies all his life, yet he succeeded in making the crown\r\nthe recognised and respected authority in Germany. Like Otto I. he used\r\nthe lesser nobles to curb the power of the greater nobles. He forced\r\nobedience to his royal laws everywhere. To perpetuate his rule and to\r\nestablish the principle of kingly heredity he had his son and heir,\r\nHenry III., crowned and coronated at Aachen (1028). Since political\r\npower depended largely upon landed wealth Henry III. received both the\r\nDuchy of Bavaria (1029) and the Duchy of Swabia (1038).\r\n\r\nThe foreign policy of Conrad II. was equally wise. He made friends of\r\nthe powerful King Canute and his Danes by marrying Henry III. to\r\nCanute's daughter. The Polish King was reduced to a vassal duke and\r\nBohemia and Lucatia were won back, while the Bulgarians were effectually\r\nheld in check. He assumed the crown of Burgundy, which became an\r\nintegral part of Germany (1032) and gave the crown to his son (1038).\r\nEarly in his rule (1026) Conrad had entered Italy and assumed the iron\r\ncrown of Lombardy. Then he made his way to Rome in 1027 on Easter day\r\nand was there crowned Emperor by Pope John XIX. in the presence of a\r\ngreat multitude of Romans and Germans. Through the Normans he then\r\nextended his imperial sway over southern Italy, but ten years later he\r\nwas forced to make a journey to Rome to reconquer that part of his\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nIn Germany Conrad II. ruled the clergy with a rod of iron, filled\r\nbishoprics for purely political ends, and used the Church to build up\r\nhis royal powers. In Lombardy he won over the clerical party at that\r\ntime hostile to the Pope, and thus smoothed his march to Rome. In John\r\nXIX. he found one of the worst examples of the utter worldliness into\r\nwhich the successors of Peter could degenerate. John XIX. before his\r\nelection had been only a business man, but he was a brother of the\r\npresiding Pontiff Benedict VIII., and a member of the powerful Tusculan\r\nfamily. By dint of money[408:1] he won the office and in one day was\r\nhurried through all the clerical orders and installed into power (1024).\r\nHoping for a powerful ally, John XIX. had invited Conrad II. to Rome. A\r\ngreat Lateran Synod followed the coronation of Conrad II. on Easter\r\nday,[408:2] but apparently nothing was said about reforms in the Church,\r\nalthough badly needed. When Conrad died in 1039 the German Empire had\r\nreached its pinnacle of greatness. No sovereign since Charles the Great\r\nhad exercised such powers, for the German and Italian princes were\r\nsubject to the imperial crown and the clergy were dependent upon it.\r\n\r\nHenry III. (1029-1056) came to the German throne with brighter prospects\r\nthan any of his predecessors. What a field for an Alexander, a Cæsar, or\r\na Napoleon! What an opportunity to cut Germany loose from the Empire\r\nand make her the greatest power in Europe! The Polish monarchy was\r\nfalling to pieces; Hungary was rent by the pagan and Christian parties;\r\nCanute's northern empire had broken down; Italy, chronically subdivided,\r\nwas awaiting a master; and the young king was also Duke of Bavaria,\r\nFranconia, and Swabia. Hindesheim, a contemporary, declared that no one\r\nin the Empire mourned the loss of Conrad because such better things were\r\nexpected of his son, one of the most highly cultured young men of the\r\nage.[409:1]\r\n\r\nHenry III. continued the policy of Otto I. by seeking to increase the\r\npower of the crown at the expense of the petty rulers. Hence duchies\r\nwere given to his relatives or to loyal vassals. The lesser nobility and\r\nthe commons were used to counteract the influence of the lords and\r\nprinces. His reign, in consequence, was disturbed by no serious\r\ninsurrections. The border states were subdued--Bohemia in 1041 and\r\nHungary in 1044.[409:2] To keep the peace and put down feuds the Truce\r\nof God was proclaimed in 1041 throughout Germany. All feuds were to\r\ncease from Wednesday eve till Monday morning and absolution from sin was\r\nthe reward for keeping the Truce.[409:3] Those who purposely broke it\r\nwere penalised. Burgundy extended it to the periods between Advent and\r\nEpiphany, and from Septuagesima to the first Sunday after Easter. Henry\r\nIII. soon made himself master of Italy and like many a predecessor\r\nassumed the iron crown of Lombardy and then established his supremacy\r\nover the Normans in the south. Out of a rule of seventeen years he\r\nspent but sixty-four weeks in Italy. In 1046 he was coronated Emperor\r\nat Rome and made Patrician.\r\n\r\nLike Charles the Great and Otto the Great Henry III. assumed the\r\nheadship of the Church. The Papacy, at that time, was a three-headed\r\nmonster which needed a Hercules to slay it. Benedict IX., another member\r\nof the Tusculum family, elected Pope when a boy of eighteen (1033), had\r\nled a life of indescribable crime and, in consequence, had been driven\r\nfrom the city (1044) but returned and in 1046 held the Vatican.[410:1]\r\nSylvester III. was elected anti-Pope when Benedict IX. was driven out\r\nand lived in St. Peter's. Gregory VI. literally bought the papal throne\r\nof Benedict IX. (1045) for 1000 pounds of silver and bribed the people\r\ninto approval. He took up his residence at St. Maria Maggiore.[410:2]\r\nLearning of these disorders, Henry III. went to Italy and in 1046 held\r\nthe Council of Sutri in which Gregory VI. acknowledged his guilt,\r\ndivested himself of his papal insignia and begged forgiveness. Benedict\r\nIX. and Sylvester III. were declared usurpers, simoniacs, and intruders,\r\nhence they were deposed. Benedict IX. hid himself for future trouble,\r\nSylvester III. returned to his bishopric and Gregory VI. was sent into\r\nexile in Germany. The Bishop of Bamberg, a German, was chosen Pope in a\r\ncouncil held in Rome and assumed the title of Clement II. (1046) and\r\nimmediately coronated Henry III. and his wife with the imperial\r\nhonours.[410:3] This is the beginning of a series of German Popes who\r\nwere to do much to purify and strengthen the Church. Before Henry died\r\nthree such Popes were elected. Clement II. soon assembled a council in\r\nRome to extirpate simony and to that end had several canons enacted. But\r\nhis reign of less than a year, was too short to accomplish much. Henry\r\nIII. died in 1056 with his great Empire full of trouble from border wars\r\nand rebellious nobles. The Empire was on the wane and his son took up a\r\ncrown of difficulties.\r\n\r\nOn Germany the effects of the creation of the Holy Roman Empire were\r\nvery marked. It established the recognised right of the German King to\r\nwear the Italian and imperial crowns and made Aachen, Milan, and Rome\r\nthe coronation cities. It tended to weaken the allegiance of the Germans\r\nto their king when he became Emperor and spent most of his time,\r\ntogether with German wealth and blood, in Italy. It fused the German\r\nKing and the Roman Emperor into a product different from either and\r\neffected the whole subsequent history of both Germany and the Empire.\r\nThe two systems were very different: one was centralised, the other\r\nlocal; one rested upon a \"sublime theory,\" the other grew out of\r\nanarchy; one was ruled by an absolute monarch, the other by a limited\r\nmonarch; one was based on the equality of all citizens, the other\r\nfounded on inequality. As a result of the fusion both offices lost and\r\nwon certain attributes and the product was a \"German Emperor\" who was\r\nthe necessary head of feudalism which became so deeply rooted that it\r\ntook ages to throw it off. To help on the process of disintegration Otto\r\nthe Great allowed the five great duchies to be subdivided and thus\r\ncreated a second order of nobility and greatly increased the number of\r\nnobles. In short Germany was weakened, impoverished, divided, and\r\nstunted. The denationalisation of Germany was continued until 1870.\r\nWhat might not have been the splendid career of Germany had Otto the\r\nGreat and his successors devoted their time and talent to the creation\r\nof a powerful German national state as did the French and English kings?\r\nIt must be added, however, that this peculiar relation with Italy opened\r\nthe way for learning, art, and a more refined civilisation in the North\r\nand that, in turn, Germany became the schoolmaster of Poland and Bohemia\r\nand perpetuated the language, literature, and law of Rome.\r\n\r\nOn Italy the Holy Roman Empire left a deep and permanent impression. It\r\ngave Italy a long line of foreign rulers who seldom cared much for her\r\nreal interests and only sought to exploit her for selfish ends. It\r\nprevented the establishment of a powerful national state as a republic,\r\nor as a monarchy, under some native noble, or a Pope, until 1859. On the\r\ncontrary it encouraged decentralisation and local division of the\r\npeople. Italy became the scene, cause, and victim of countless wars and\r\ninvasions by foreign rulers; or of innumerable local contests which\r\nsapped the nation of all strength and ambition.\r\n\r\nOn the Empire the results were plainly seen. The Empire of the Cæsars\r\nand of Charles the Great was revived on a German basis with a German\r\nEmperor and kept alive till 1806 when Napoleon dealt it a death-blow.\r\nIts earlier extent and later claims were never realised. It was forced\r\ninto a continual struggle for its existence with the Italian republics\r\nand German dukes, with the Papacy, and with the national states of\r\nEurope. The three theories about the relation of the world-empire to the\r\nworld-church received final development.\r\n\r\n1. The Holy Empire, or ideal theory, united the Church and the state,\r\nthe cross and the sceptre, to attain their legitimate boundaries,\r\nnamely, the world. Hence the Papacy and the Empire were but two sides of\r\nthe same thing and their two heads co-operated to rule the same regions\r\nand peoples, but in different spheres. The Pope ruled the souls of men;\r\nthe Emperor their bodies; but both were necessary, equal, and\r\nestablished by God. It was a confusion of these two powers and ideas\r\nthat produced such mediæval anachronisms as churchmen who were worldly\r\nprinces with large estates, who led their flocks to war, and who became\r\nthe prime ministers of kings; and secular rulers who appointed Church\r\nofficials and called and presided over councils. This was the theory\r\nheld by dreamers and theorists, but it was never realised.\r\n\r\n2. The papal theory made the Pope alone God's representative on earth\r\nand maintained that the Emperor received his right to rule from St.\r\nPeter's successor. For historical proof of the genuineness of this\r\nposition attention was called to the power of the keys, the Donation of\r\nConstantine, the coronation of Pepin, the restoration of the Empire in\r\nthe West. Such figures as the sun and the moon, the body and the soul,\r\netc., were used with telling effect by the clerical party who advanced\r\nthis theory. It was upheld by Nicholas I., Hildebrand, Alexander III.,\r\nInnocent III., and culminated with Boniface VIII. at the jubilee of 1300\r\nwhen, seated on the throne of Constantine, girded with the imperial\r\nsword, wearing a crown, and waving a sceptre, he shouted to the throng\r\nof loyal pilgrims: \"I am Cæsar--I am Emperor.\"\r\n\r\n3. The imperial theory put the Emperor above the Pope as God's\r\nvice-regent on earth and reduced the Pope to the position of chief\r\nbishop in the Empire. It was held that historical evidence to support\r\nthis position could be found in the Jewish theocracy; the words of Jesus\r\nand the apostles about civil power; the seniority of the Empire over the\r\nPapacy; the attitude of Constantine and later Emperors; the work of\r\nCharles the Great, Otto the Great, and their illustrious successors.\r\nThis theory was defended by the Emperors, kings, civil lawyers, and\r\nmembers of the imperial party.\r\n\r\nSo far as the Papacy was concerned the Holy Roman Empire created a rival\r\nworld-ruler with whom for five hundred years the Popes were in almost\r\nendless strife. Under powerful rulers like Otto the Great the Papacy was\r\nsubjected to the Empire more absolutely than in the day of Charles the\r\nGreat. Under the great German Emperors much was done to reform the\r\nChurch and to advance its interests and influence in the world. Each\r\nEmperor took a coronation oath to defend and protect the Church against\r\nheretics, schismatics, infidels, pagans, and all other enemies, and that\r\nobligation was as a rule faithfully and loyally kept. But all things\r\nconsidered was the Papacy stronger or weaker, better or worse, for the\r\ncreation of the Holy Roman Empire? Does the fact that the Papacy\r\ndeclined with the decay and death of the Empire suggest a necessary\r\ndependence of the former on the latter?\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nA.--PRIMARY:\r\n\r\n    I.--IN ENGLISH: The materials available in English are scarce\r\n          and very unsatisfactory.

V.--Sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nNicholas I., through the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals, had raised the\r\nChurch above the state, made the Pope supreme in the Church, and\r\ninaugurated needed reforms.[418:1] From Nicholas I. to Hildebrand\r\n(867-1049), for about two centuries, the Popes as a rule were men of\r\nvery ordinary ability and education. Many of them gained the papal\r\noffice by crime, or force, or bribery, and used it for corrupt purposes.\r\nMost of the fifty Popes and six anti-Popes of this period were Italians.\r\nThe chair of St. Peter was far more political and worldly than\r\nspiritual. The latter part of the ninth century Rome saw twelve Popes\r\nelected in twenty-three years. Hadrian II. (867-872), an ex-married man\r\nwith a family, connected with many a domestic scandal,[418:2] succeeded\r\nNicholas I., and defended the papal pretensions with ability and\r\ndignity. Then followed John VIII. (872-882), an active, passionate,\r\nshrewd prelate, who was killed by a relative covetous of the papal\r\nthrone with its wealth and influence. Stephen VI. (896-897) in revenge\r\ncaused the body of Formosus, his predecessor, to be exhumed, clad in\r\npontifical robes, seated on the pontifical throne, tried by a synod,\r\ndeposed as a usurper, the fingers with which the pontifical blessing was\r\ngiven cut off, and thrown into the Tiber. He, himself, was cast into\r\nprison and there strangled to death (897).\r\n\r\nDuring the tenth century the Papacy was a reflection of the chaotic,\r\nanarchistic condition of the state, the demoralisation and depravity of\r\nsociety, and the ignorance, superstition, and crime of the day.[419:1]\r\nThe head of the Church had lost all dignity and independence, and the\r\noffice had become a prey to greed, force, and intrigue. Most of the\r\nPopes ended their careers in deposition, prison, or murder. The\r\nMarquises of Tuscany and the Counts of Tusculum ruled the city of Rome\r\nand dictated the election of Popes for more than half a century.\r\nThree bold, beautiful, wealthy Roman women,--Theodora and her two\r\ndaughters--Marozia and Theodora--filled the chair of St. Peter with\r\ntheir lovers and their bastards.[419:2] This period has been given the\r\nsignificant name of pornocracy. John X. (914-928), the first\r\nwarrior-Pope, lead an army against the Saracens and defeated them. He\r\nwas imprisoned and murdered by the wicked Marozia (928). John XII.\r\n(955-963) was governor of Rome and frequently appeared dressed as a\r\nsoldier.[419:3] The Papacy was openly bought and sold for money.\r\nBenedict VIII. and John XIX. were both indebted for their elevation to\r\nacknowledged bribery, and the latter was only a layman when elected but\r\nin one day passed through all the requisite clerical degrees and thus\r\nqualified for the high office. The most conspicuous case was that of\r\nGregory VI. who paid one thousand pounds in silver for the empty\r\nhonour.[420:1] The office of the Papacy practically became hereditary.\r\nLaymen as well as churchmen were elected. Benedict IX. (1033-1045)\r\nascended the papal throne at the age of ten and thought of marrying in\r\norder to transmit his infamous rule.[420:2]\r\n\r\nThe higher clergy in this period of disorder were for the most part\r\nsecular princes. They ruled large tracts of land, possessed and\r\nexercised royal prerogatives, and were granted immunities and privileges\r\nsuch as market rights, coinage, tolls, feudal judicature, etc.\r\nFurthermore they assumed secular titles and offices. The leading\r\nstatesmen of the day were chosen from the clergy. Louis the Infant made\r\nthe Abbot of Corvey a count (900), and gave the Bishop of Tours the same\r\ntitle (902). Henry I. made the Bishop of Tule also the Duke of Tule\r\n(928).[420:3] Otto I. gave his own brother, the Archbishop of Köln, the\r\nduchy of Lorraine and made him Count of Brandenburg and Magdeburg. Otto\r\nIII. and Henry III. also made many such grants to churchmen. These\r\nhigher clergy were married in many cases, or lived with mistresses, and\r\nhad families. After the time of Otto I. they began to counteract the\r\npower of the nobles, hence they were made more and more dependent upon\r\nkings, who claimed the right to appoint them, who invested them with\r\ntheir power, and to whom they swore allegiance. They appeared at the\r\ncourt of the king like nobles, and in the event of war led their troops\r\nin person to the battlefield. Depositions for alleged disloyalty were\r\nvery common. As the bishops became more involved in secular affairs they\r\nnaturally neglected their spiritual duties. Simony crept in as a\r\nconsequence and was shamefully practised. Often the worst fitted instead\r\nof the best prepared persons were given the coveted sinecures. It was\r\nbut natural that the moral example set by the Pope should reveal itself\r\nin the lives of the clergy.\r\n\r\nGreedy hands were raised against the monasteries, and their rich lands\r\nwere frequently given as fiefs to laymen.[421:1] The abbots began to\r\nstrive for worldly reputation and power. Hence the old discipline was\r\nneglected, and disorders and excesses of all kinds prevailed among the\r\nmonks and nuns.[421:2] The common priests and monks were probably better\r\nas a rule than either Popes or bishops, still in too many cases they\r\nwere prone to follow the example set by their superiors. The laity were\r\nundoubtedly on a lower moral and intellectual plane than the\r\npriesthood.[421:3] Consequently few complaints were made by them against\r\nthe sins and crimes of Popes, bishops, abbots, and priests. The\r\ndenunciation of flagrant abuses and the cry for reform, as far as there\r\nwas any, came from the better clergy. Of the eighty councils held in\r\nFrance during the eleventh century, every one denounced the lawlessness\r\nof the laity and the unchastity and simony of the clergy.[422:1]\r\n\r\nThe manifold corruptions of the tenth century and the first part of the\r\neleventh produced a clergy that had almost forfeited its spiritual\r\ncharacter. Religion was a cloak for immorality, for licentious\r\nself-indulgence, and for corruption and venality which can scarcely be\r\nequalled in the entire history of the Christian Church. It was a matter\r\nof common notoriety that France and Germany were addicted, almost equal\r\nto Italy, to a shameless traffic in ecclesiastical offices and\r\npreferments.\r\n\r\nThe most startling picture of the condition of the clergy comes from the\r\npen of Desiderius, Abbot of Monte Cassino, who later became Pope Victor\r\nIII.:\r\n\r\n     The Italian priesthood, and among them most conspicuously the\r\n     Roman pontiffs, are in the habit of defying all law and all\r\n     authority; thus utterly confounding together things sacred and\r\n     profane. During all this time the Italian priesthood, and none\r\n     more conspicuously than the Roman pontiffs, set at naught all\r\n     ecclesiastical law and authority. The people sold their\r\n     suffrages for money to the highest bidder; the clergy, moved\r\n     and seduced by avarice and ambition, bought and sold the\r\n     sacred rights of ordination, and carried on a gigantic traffic\r\n     with the gifts of the Holy Ghost. Few prelates remained\r\n     untainted with the vile pollution of simony; few, very few,\r\n     kept the commandments of God, or served him with upright\r\n     hearts; following their chiefs to do evil, the great\r\n     sacerdotal herd rushed headlong down the precipice into the\r\n     quagmire of licentiousness and profligacy: priests and\r\n     deacons, whose duty it was to serve God with clean hands, and\r\n     with chaste bodies to administer the sacraments of the Lord,\r\n     took to themselves wives after the manner of the laity; they\r\n     left families behind them, and bequeathed their ill-gotten\r\n     wealth to their children; yea, even bishops, in contempt of\r\n     all shame and decency, dwelt with their wives under the same\r\n     roof--a nefarious and execrable custom, prevailing, alas! most\r\n     commonly in that city where the laws, thus shamefully set at\r\n     naught, first issued from the sacred lips of the Prince of the\r\n     Apostles and his holy successors.[423:1]\r\n\r\nWhen Otto III., the last of the Saxon Emperors, died, the Papacy had\r\nbecome, apparently, merged in the state. The initiative of the Pope in\r\nall important matters seemed to flow from imperial rather than\r\npontifical prerogative. The arbitrary erection of all sorts of\r\necclesiastical foundations, the unquestioned secular appointment to the\r\nhighest offices in the Church, and the legislation by the state in\r\necclesiastical affairs, all point to a closer fusion of the two powers\r\nthan since the year 476. But there was no deliberate intention to\r\nencroach upon ecclesiastical right. The alliance was reciprocally\r\nadvantageous. There could be no Emperor without a Pope, and no Pope\r\nwithout an Emperor. The causes for this ascendancy of the temporal power\r\nwere: (1) the decay of ecclesiastical organisation and discipline; (2)\r\nthe disruption of society and the confusion of political matters in\r\nItaly and Europe generally; (3) the rise of the power and ambition of\r\nthe German sovereigns; (4) the social demoralisation of the age--the\r\nwide-spread incontinence, perjury, venality, rapine, bribery, theft, and\r\nmurder which infected the Church to its heart's core. Until these\r\nhumiliating and devitalising forces were remedied, the Church could not\r\nhope to attain independence.[423:2]\r\n\r\nSeveral distinct efforts at reform were made before the time of\r\nHildebrand, first by the German Emperors and secondly by the German\r\nPopes. Henry the Fowler (918-936) declared that he would abolish simony\r\nbut failed to do so. Otto the Great (936-973) deposed the criminal Pope\r\nJohn XII., elected Leo VIII. in his place, and honestly intended to\r\nimprove the Papacy. Otto III. (983-1002), a great religious enthusiast,\r\ndesired to reform the Church through good Popes. Hence he chose Bruno, a\r\nman of piety and morality, as the first German Pope, and then appointed\r\nGerbert renowned for sanctity and learning. Henry II., called the Saint\r\n(1002-1024), was the first genuine imperial reformer. He opened a\r\ncampaign in Germany against simony and the marriage of the clergy. He\r\nreformed the monasteries by destroying or uniting small monasteries, by\r\nabolishing abuses, and by confiscating lands. With the King of France he\r\nagreed to hold a great council at Pavia to cure the evils in the Church\r\nboth north and south of the Alps (1023). Notwithstanding these efforts\r\nlittle real reform was accomplished. Henry III. (1039-1056), thoroughly\r\nimbued with Clugniac zeal for reformation, had Leo IX. hold a big synod\r\nat Mainz (1049) in which simony was denounced, marriage of the clergy\r\ncondemned, and local prelates ordered to abolish both evils. Personally\r\nthis ruler was wholly free from simony and waged an unrelenting war\r\nagainst the abuse both in Italy and in Germany.[424:1] He deposed three\r\nbishops for sins and crimes. He appointed a series of Clugniac puritans\r\nto the papal chair[424:2] and thus paved the way for Hildebrand.\r\n\r\nThe German Popes were very active in reformatory efforts. Gregory V.\r\n(996-999), who was Bruno[425:1] of the royal house of Germany, appointed\r\nby Otto II., renowned for piety and of unblemished character, assumed a\r\nlofty, dignified attitude as Pope and soon made his power felt in\r\nEurope. He purified the papal court as far as possible and suppressed\r\nthe independence of the French clergy, but died too soon to realise his\r\nhopes of reformation.\r\n\r\nGerbert, or Sylvester II. (999-1003),[425:2] born of poor parents, was\r\neducated as a teacher first in the Clugniac cloister of Aurillac and\r\nthen taken by Count Borrel of Barcelona to Spain, where he studied\r\nmathematics and the natural sciences in the Mohammedan schools. There\r\nBishop Hatto took a fancy to him and invited him to go to Rome where\r\nPope John XIII. noticed him and recommended him to Otto the Great (971).\r\nThe Emperor sent him to Rheims to be instructed in logic (972). The\r\nArchbishop Adelbert of Rheims soon made him a teacher in the cathedral\r\nschool. There he taught the writings of Aristotle, the Latin classics,\r\nand the sciences. Boethius was his favourite author and science his\r\n\"darling study.\" He had many pupils from far and near and gained great\r\nfame for his scholarship.[425:3]\r\n\r\nIn those days nearly every great man was drawn into the Church, not\r\nalone because his services were needed, but also for the reason that in\r\nthat field were the greatest opportunities for advancement. Otto III.,\r\ntherefore, made Gerbert Abbot of Gabbia, but he soon resigned the\r\nposition (982). Nine years later he was chosen Archbishop of Rheims\r\n(991).[426:1] In this new office he was kept very busy. He had a council\r\npass an edict which was practically a declaration of independence.[426:2]\r\nHe formed a confession of faith which was not considered orthodox.[426:3]\r\nHis severe code of morals offended the looser clergy and aroused the\r\njealousy of others. Consequently a party was organised against him\r\ncomposed of the clergy, Emperor, and Pope; and the papal legate held a\r\ncourt in Germany which deprived him of his episcopal functions.[426:4]\r\nThus driven from office, he joined the court of Otto III. to cast his\r\nspell over that young idealist. In 996 he went with him down to Italy\r\nwhere he was soon elevated to the Archbishopric of Ravenna and invested\r\nwith the insignia of his office by Gregory V. (998). Upon the death\r\nof Gregory V., in 999 Otto III. elevated him to that important\r\noffice[426:5] as Sylvester II. He surrendered his heretical ideas and\r\nbecame the great forerunner of Hildebrand in attacking simony, in\r\ndenouncing clerical abuses, in subjecting the higher clergy to his will,\r\nand in compelling obedience from the secular powers. To Stephen of\r\nHungary he gave a king's crown and made him primate (1000).[426:6] He\r\nsuggested the crusades and laboured with Otto III. for the realisation\r\nof the world Empire. After his death in 1003 he soon became the subject\r\nof all sort of wild legends.\r\n\r\nBenedict VIII. (1012-1024) was elevated to the Papacy as a reform Pope\r\nby Henry II. and the German party, though he was not a German. He\r\nbelonged to the Clugniac reform party and was a brave, independent Pope\r\nwho joined the Emperor in assailing simony and in sanctioning the\r\ncelibacy of the clergy. Clement II. (1046-1047) was made Pope by Henry\r\nIII. after deposing three rival Popes. He held a Roman synod which\r\ncondemned simony for the future, forbade the practice by churchmen, made\r\nthe penalty for disobedience excommunication, and endeavoured to\r\neradicate the evil in Italy and Germany.[427:1]\r\n\r\nThe reform efforts of the Popes were supplemented by the reforming\r\nmonastic orders. St. Nilus (910-1005), a Greek born in Calabria, after\r\nhis wife's death in 940 entered the monastery of St. Mercurius, where he\r\nsoon gained renown for his tortures, piety, and studies. Becoming\r\ndisgusted with the monastic practices, he left the convent and wandered\r\nabout as a hermit, taking St. Anthony as his model. His fame soon spread\r\nabroad so that when he made a pilgrimage to Rome he was greatly honoured\r\nthere and even consulted by Gregory V. and Otto III. It was not long\r\nbefore he gained a large following of ascetics in Italy and with them\r\nfounded several cloisters which were models of lofty zeal and\r\npiety.[427:2]\r\n\r\nAnother monk of this period imbued with the desire for reformation\r\nwithin the Church was St. Dunstan (924-988), the son of a West Saxon\r\nnoble, educated in the monastic school of Glastonbury, and trained at\r\ncourt.[427:3] He early adopted the life of a monk, became a hermit,\r\nstudied the Scriptures and made bells, and was given to prayers and\r\nvisions. Appointed Abbot of Glastonbury in 945, he began to reform the\r\nmonastic life by restoring the early purity and simplicity. Becoming too\r\nmuch absorbed in the politics of his day and thereby coming under the\r\ndispleasure of the king, he was banished to Flanders in 956 where he\r\nfirst learned of St. Benedict's rule. Two years later, however, he was\r\nrecalled to England and soon appointed Archbishop of Canterbury. Then he\r\nwent to Rome to receive the pallium and, returning to his native land,\r\nput himself at the head of the reform party. He sought to replace the\r\nseculars by monks, to introduce the Benedictine rule, to enforce\r\ncelibacy, to prevent concubinage, to require all priests to learn\r\ntrades, and to forbid the clergy to hunt, hawk, play dice, get drunk,\r\nand scold.\r\n\r\nThe monastery of Clugny grew out of the urgent need of monastic reform.\r\nIt was founded in 910 by Duke William of Aquitaine to honour Peter and\r\nPaul and was put under the immediate control and direction of the\r\nPope.[428:1] Bruno (d. 927) was made the first abbot. He was a\r\nBurgundian who had already gained renown as a monastic leader. A\r\nmodified St. Benedict's rule was introduced into the new monastery which\r\nabsolutely forbade the possession of private property, prohibited the\r\neating of quadrupeds, enforced a silence which resulted in the\r\ndevelopment of a sign language, required psalm singing and Bible\r\nreading, and demanded unquestioned obedience. Before Bruno's death six\r\ncloisters had been founded. Odo (927-941), a pupil and follower of\r\nBruno, succeeded him.[428:2] He was a man of great energy and unusual\r\nspirituality, and outlined the literary work of the order. From Pope\r\nJohn XI. he obtained the permit to unite more cloisters under his rule\r\nand to accept monks from unreformed monasteries. Before his death he had\r\nrestored the ancient cloister life in countless monasteries over France\r\nand in Italy. Under succeeding abbots, Aymar (941-948), Majola\r\n(948-994), Odilo (994-1048), and Hugh (1048-1109), reforms were extended\r\nto German cloisters and to English monasteries; social and economic\r\nreformatory results were produced; the Truce of God was promulgated; and\r\nthe reform spirit was spread throughout the Church, particularly in\r\nreference to simony, celibacy, and concubinage, and uncanonical marriage\r\nof the laity. At its height Clugny ruled over two thousand monasteries\r\nand produced such Popes as Hildebrand, Urban II., and Pascal II. After\r\nthe thirteenth century the order began to decline and finally the French\r\nRevolution swept it out of existence.[429:1]\r\n\r\nThe Camaldolites grew out of an Italian reform movement independent of\r\nClugny though no doubt related to it.[429:2] It came into existence at\r\nthe end of the tenth century when the Clugniac movement had already\r\nreformed many of the Italian monasteries. The fundamental idea of this\r\norder was to reform the monastic evils of Italy by reviving the\r\nstrictest form of ascetic life. The hermit, Simeon, St. Dominicus of\r\nFoligno, and St. Nilus were worthy, inspiring examples. Traditions of\r\nthe Greek monastic fathers still lingered in southern Italy and in the\r\nApennines land may have had some influence. St. Romould, born at\r\nRavenna in 950 of a rich noble family, was the real founder. After\r\nleading a gay youth, at the age of twenty, he entered a Benedictine\r\nmonastery to atone for his father's sin in murdering a relative, which\r\ncrime he witnessed with his own eyes. He intended to remain only forty\r\ndays but stayed three years, yet found no peace for his soul. Then he\r\nturned hermit, practised the severest tortures to defeat the devil,\r\ntravelled from place to place, gained great fame, had a crowd of\r\nfollowers wherever he went, organised them and appointed a leader, and\r\nthen moved on to a new field of labour. As his life drew near its close,\r\nhe retired to Camaldoli in the Apennines, and hence the name of the\r\nplace was given to his order (1018). To govern these little bands St.\r\nBenedict's rule, modified by eastern asceticism, was used. The monks\r\nlived in single cells, but had a common meeting place for worship and\r\nfor eating. Wine and meat were forbidden, and all days except Thursday\r\nand Sunday were fast days. The monks were barefooted and went about in\r\nsilence with hair and beard uncut, performing the duties of farmers and\r\nmakers of nets and baskets. Some of the more ascetic lived for years\r\nwithout leaving their cells. They were the first to use assistants as\r\nservants. St. Romould had a great influence on his age and was called a\r\nprophet and a miracle worker. He induced men like the Doge of Venice to\r\ntake up the monastic life and was visited by the young Otto III. (999).\r\nHe sent missionaries to Russia and Poland, and went himself to Hungary\r\nwith twenty-four monks, but was compelled by illness to return to Italy.\r\nHe preached with great power against the immoral, simoniacal, and wicked\r\nclergy, the monastic abuses, simony, and the marriage of churchmen.\r\nAfter his death in 1027, his work was carried on by his disciples and\r\nthe order has lived on through the varying vicissitudes of succeeding\r\ncenturies.[431:1]\r\n\r\nThe Vallombrosians originated in Tuscany in 1040 as an outgrowth of the\r\nCamaldolian reform movement. St. John Gualbert, the scion of a noble\r\nFlorentine family, was the founder. Sent by his father to kill the\r\nmurderer of his brother, he spared his life, when he made the sign of\r\nthe cross with his arms. On his return to Florence, entering the little\r\nChurch of San Miniato to pray before an image of Jesus, the figure\r\nnodded its head in approval of his act of mercy. As a result in 1038 he\r\nbecame a monk and soon joined St. Romould. Two years later he determined\r\nto found an order of his own at Vallombrosa. Followers enough came to\r\nbegin his organisation and they were put under St. Benedict's rule\r\nmodified to meet his ideas. Candidates were put on a year's probation\r\nand members were divided into three classes,--the religious, the serving\r\nbrethren, and the laity. When he died in 1073, seven cloisters had been\r\nestablished in Italy, and when the founder was made a saint in 1193 they\r\nnumbered sixty.\r\n\r\nThe monastery of Hirshau was established in the Black Forest of\r\nGermany.[431:2] William of Bavaria began the reformation there in 1065\r\nby freeing the monastery from secular control, drawing up a constitution\r\nfor it on reform lines, patterning its policy after the Clugniac\r\nmovement, and introducing lay brethren. From Hirshau reformation spread\r\nover a large part of Germany, and these reform cloisters strongly\r\nsupported the lofty programme of Gregory VII.[432:1]\r\n\r\nPeter Damiani was born in Ravenna of poor parents in 1006 and early left\r\nan orphan. As a boy he had a hard life, but was educated by a brother at\r\nRavenna, Faenza, and Parma. Then he became a teacher and gained wealth\r\nand fame as an instructor in grammar and rhetoric at Ravenna. Suddenly\r\nat the age of twenty-nine resolving to become a monk, he entered a\r\nmonastery at Fonte Avellano where he excelled the old monks in\r\nintemperate tortures, studied the Scriptures and preached, and wrote a\r\nbiography of St. Romould. At the age of thirty-seven he was chosen abbot\r\nand then introduced St. Romould's Benedictine rule, which made fasting\r\nand torture a regular system. Each psalm was to be recited accompanied\r\nby one hundred lashes on the bare back and the whole psalter with one\r\nthousand five hundred lashes. This practice soon became a regular craze\r\nand was taken up later by the Dominicans, the Franciscans, and the\r\nFlagellants. He permitted his monks to read the Scriptures and the\r\nFathers, encouraged them in performing hand work, but cut them off\r\nwholly from the world. He soon became the recognised leader of the\r\nreform party in Europe. He denounced his age as worse than that of Sodom\r\nand Gomorrah; demanded a reformation of monasteries, of all the clergy,\r\nand of the Church in general; dedicated his life to a crusade against\r\nsimony and marriage of the clergy; and condemned in the clergy the\r\npractice of bearing arms as Leo IX. did in driving back the Normans\r\n(1053). Damiani was too big a man to remain in obscurity, hence he\r\nbecame Bishop of Ostia and in 1058 was made Cardinal. In the papal\r\ncourt he was a very prominent personage, serving as legate on many an\r\nimportant mission, and in 1061 was almost chosen Pope. He was the\r\nspiritual counsellor and censor of seven Hildebrandine popes, and called\r\nhimself the \"Lord of the Pope\" and Hildebrand's \"Holy Satan.\" He won the\r\nconfidence of Henry III. and exercised great control over Henry IV. He\r\ndied in 1072 just a year before Hildebrand became Pope.[433:1]\r\n\r\nNext to Peter Damiani both in time and importance comes Hildebrand. From\r\nthe scanty sources concerning his youth it is known that he was born in\r\nTuscany at Saona about 1020 of parents in humble circumstances. His\r\nfather's name was Bonizo, but whether he was of Teutonic or Roman race,\r\nor whether his occupation was that of a carpenter, a farmer, or a\r\ngoatherd, are unsettled questions. His mother is unknown, but she had a\r\nbrother who was Abbot of St. Mary's on the Aventine in Rome and one of\r\nthe twenty churchmen who helped the Pope celebrate mass. To that uncle's\r\nmonastery in the Eternal City young Hildebrand was early sent and there\r\nstudied Latin, rhetoric, mathematics, music, dialectics, and the Church\r\nFathers. There too he became imbued with the venerableness of Holy Rome\r\nand the sacred authority of the Chair of St. Peter, so that in the\r\nstormy days of his old age he could write that St. Peter had nourished\r\nhim from childhood. Under these surroundings it was but natural that he\r\nshould decide to be a monk. Soon he was driven to ascetic severities,\r\nprobably by the corruptions and abuses thrust upon him from all sides.\r\nIn this monastery he met such men as Odilo, Abbot of Clugny, leader of\r\nthe reform movement in France, who was accustomed to make St. Mary's his\r\nstopping place when in Rome; Archbishop Laurentius of Amalfi, who may\r\nhave taught him the classics; and Archpresbyter John Gratian, a teacher\r\nin St. Mary's, who later purchased the papal crown and became Pope\r\nGregory VI.\r\n\r\nAbbot Odilo, favourably impressed with the young monk's ability and\r\npiety, took him to Clugny, where he completed his studies, practised the\r\nsevere discipline of the Benedictines, and became grave and puritanical.\r\nThe life of a monk probably affected Hildebrand as later it did Luther.\r\nHe seems to have travelled some in Germany--perhaps even visited the\r\ncourt of Henry III. for his order. He may have completed his novitiate\r\nat Clugny. From this reform atmosphere Hildebrand returned to Rome when\r\nthree Popes were claiming the apostolic seat and the Papacy was in its\r\ndepths of humiliation. Gregory VI., one of the trio, Hildebrand's old\r\nteacher, who had bought the office for 1000 pounds in silver, made the\r\nyoung monk his chaplain. Soon he saw the German Emperor, Henry III.,\r\ncome to Rome, hold a council, depose the three Popes, exile his master\r\nto a German monastery, and in 1046 elect a new Pontiff. True to his\r\nunfortunate friend, Hildebrand followed him to Germany to see him die in\r\n1048 of a broken heart and then, apparently, he returned to\r\nClugny.[434:1]\r\n\r\nPope Clement II., raised to the papal chair by Henry III. (1046), died\r\nwithin a year and Damasus II. followed him in twenty-three days. The\r\nRoman people then prayed the Emperor to name a new papal sovereign and\r\nhe chose his cousin Bruno Pope in the Diet of Worms in 1048 and had him\r\nassume the pontifical insignia. This was a new method of election and\r\ncertainly a dangerous precedent. Bruno was a German, born at Alsace in\r\n1002, well educated and at twenty-four elected Bishop of Toul. He joined\r\nthe Clugniac reform party and enforced reformation in his diocese. He\r\nserved the German king on several delicate secular missions,\r\nparticularly to Burgundy and France, and gained a reputation as a good,\r\nclever, honest, brave, devout man. When elected to this high office he\r\nwas a matured man, handsome, tall and stately, with a strong frank face,\r\nand was a general favourite. As a pilgrim he had often gone to Rome and\r\nwas familiar with the conditions there. His biographer said of the\r\ntimes: \"The World lay in wickedness; holiness had disappeared; justice\r\nhad perished; truth had been buried; Simon Magnus lorded it over the\r\nChurch, whose bishops and priests were given to luxury and\r\nfornication.\"[435:1] In Rome the churches were neglected and in ruins,\r\nsheep and cattle went in and out of the broken doors, and the monks and\r\nclergy were steeped in immorality.[435:2]\r\n\r\nBruno asked Hildebrand, who appears to have been at the Diet of Worms,\r\nto go with him to Rome, but that austere monk replied, \"I cannot\r\naccompany you because, without canonical institution, and by the royal\r\nand secular power alone, you are going to seize upon the Roman Church.\"\r\nIf that statement is correct, it shows Hildebrand's ideas of the\r\nrelation of Church and state twenty-five years before he became Pope.\r\nBruno was persuaded, put off the papal robes, and declared that he would\r\nnot accept the papal crown save by the free election of the Roman\r\nclergy and people. Then the two started for Rome as barefooted pilgrims\r\nand many a legendary tale has grown up about that journey, which took\r\ntwo months. At length reaching Rome, these two pious churchmen were\r\nheartily welcomed by the Romans and Bruno was chosen Pope in a great\r\ngathering in 1049 and coronated as Leo IX.\r\n\r\nWith Leo IX. began that new policy of reformation and purification of\r\nwhich Hildebrand was the genius and Innocent III. executor. The spirit\r\nof the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals and of Clugny were to be united and to\r\npredominate. To reform the curia was the first step of the new Pope. He\r\ndid this by surrounding himself with good men like Hildebrand, Peter\r\nDamiani, Cardinal Humbert, and Archbishop Halimand of Lyons. His next\r\nmove was to abolish the flagrant evils in the Church such as simony, the\r\nviolation of celibacy, unjust tithing of the laity, uncanonical\r\nmarriages of the laity, and lay investiture. These various reforms were\r\nto be inaugurated through Church synods, such as the annual Easter\r\nsynods in Rome, national synods, and local synods. Leo IX. presided over\r\neleven of these synods in person and travelled incessantly through\r\nItaly, France, and Germany to enforce the reforms, to root out heresy,\r\nto settle disputes, to make appointments, and to manage Church affairs.\r\nTo enforce his measures in southern Italy he led an army of Italians and\r\nGermans against the Normans in 1053, but was defeated and taken\r\nprisoner, whereupon he put all the Normans under the ban. They begged\r\ntheir sacred captive to remove the dreaded curse but he refused until\r\nthey should kiss his feet and recognise the rights of the Church. When\r\nhe died in 1054, beloved by all Christendom, he had accomplished more\r\nin the way of reformation than any Pope since Nicholas I. and he left\r\nbehind him a new religious enthusiasm soon to be felt all over\r\nEurope.[437:1]\r\n\r\nLeo IX. had entrusted papal affairs to Hildebrand until a new Pope\r\nshould be elected, hence all eyes were on him and his friends wanted to\r\nmake him Supreme Pontiff. But he saw the time was not ripe for his work\r\nand refused. Hildebrand then headed a delegation to ask the Emperor\r\nHenry III. to confirm the nomination of Gebhard, Bishop of Eichstädt, a\r\nfriend and relative. After the imperial nomination at Mainz, Gebhard\r\nwent to Rome, was there elected in due canonical form as Pope Victor II.\r\n(1055), and immediately took up Hildebrand's sweeping reform\r\npolicy.[437:2] Formerly he had advocated a national Church and was a\r\nmaster of Clugniac politics. Now, however, he accepted the papal theory\r\nin its entirety. With the Emperor he held a council at Florence which\r\nforbade the alienation of Church property, enacted rules of discipline,\r\nand determined matters of doctrine.[437:3] To cure abuses of the French\r\nclergy he sent Hildebrand to France, who succeeded in humbling the\r\nbishops guilty of simony.[437:4] Victor II. himself held a council at\r\nTours to discuss the imperial claims of Ferdinand the Great of Spain and\r\nHenry III. of Germany, thus assuming that it was his prerogative to act\r\nin the capacity of arbiter. He went to Germany in 1056 to see Henry III.\r\ndie, to hold the centrifugal forces in check in behalf of Henry IV., and\r\nto thwart the ambition of Mamno of Cologne and Adelbert of Bremen to\r\nestablish a northern patriarchate. The following year he returned to\r\nItaly and there soon died (1057), beloved throughout all Christendom.\r\n\r\nFive days after the death of Victor II. the Romans, not waiting for the\r\nreturn of Hildebrand, who was still absent on papal business, chose\r\nCardinal Frederick of Lorraine Pope and jubilantly inaugurated him\r\n(Aug. 2, 1057). The new Pontiff, who took the name of Stephen IX., was\r\nan old enemy of Henry III., had been made Cardinal and Chancellor by\r\nLeo IX., had been sent to Constantinople to heal the breach between\r\nthe East and the West (1054), and had been appointed Abbot of Monte\r\nCasino (1057).[438:1] Since he was elected without the consent of\r\nthe German imperial party, Hildebrand, elevated to the dignity of\r\ncardinal-archdeacon, was sent north to appease the Queen Regent. Stephen\r\nIX. manifested his sincere desire to carry forward the work of\r\nreformation. Allied with him to accomplish this work were Hildebrand,\r\nthe greatest man in Rome, and Damiani, the leader of the reform party,\r\nwhom he appointed Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia. This trio no doubt would\r\nhave made great headway in the reform propagandism had not the Pope died\r\nso soon (Mar. 29, 1058). Before death stilled his tongue, however, he\r\nmade his court promise not to elect a successor without the advice of\r\nHildebrand, who was still absent in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe party of nobles in Rome, not heeding the wishes of Stephen IX.,\r\nimmediately elected as Pope Benedict X., and every friend of reform was\r\ndriven from the city. Hildebrand upon returning to Rome secured the\r\nelevation of Gerhard, Bishop of Florence, to the papal chair and\r\ninaugurated him without difficulty, whereupon Benedict X. surrendered\r\nand was pardoned, though degraded and confined for life within the\r\nprecincts of St. Maria Maggiore.[439:1] The new Pope, Nicholas II.,\r\npractically allowed Hildebrand to dictate his policy. First he sought to\r\nfree the Church from imperial domination and to elevate it above the\r\nstate. The death of Henry III. (1056) and the coronation of his son of\r\nsix as Henry IV. removed a powerful barrier to that object. Germany was\r\ndivided into an imperial and anti-imperial party. In this condition\r\nItalian influence could be used as the determining factor in German\r\npolitics, hence the states of Italy were forced to recognise the\r\nover-sovereignty of the Pope.\r\n\r\nIn the next place Nicholas II. endeavoured to regulate the papal\r\nelections so as to prevent a repetition of the election of Benedict X.\r\nand at the same time to eliminate the influence of the Emperor. The\r\nLateran Council held April 13, 1059, attended by the Pope and one\r\nhundred and thirteen bishops,[439:2] many abbots, and a vast concourse\r\nof priests and deacons, after condemning Benedict X., prohibiting\r\nsimony, denouncing lay investiture, and decreeing celibacy to be the law\r\nof the Church, created the College of Cardinals.[439:3] The election of\r\nthe Pope was now put into the hands of the Roman cardinal-bishops,[439:4]\r\nwho were to submit their nominee to the lower clergy and the people for\r\napproval. This practically excluded both the Roman nobles and the Roman\r\nEmperor. This edict was the greatest revolution ever attempted in the\r\nhierarchy. It was an effort to give the Papacy a constitution which\r\nwould make it independent. An election by any hands but the cardinals'\r\ncould now be called unconstitutional or uncanonical. And any person who\r\nattempted to resist or impugn the regulation was to be smitten with an\r\nawful curse:\r\n\r\n     Let him be damned by anathema and excommunication, and be\r\n     counted among the impious in the resurrection of condemnation;\r\n     may the wrath of Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and the fury of\r\n     the Apostles Peter and Paul, whose Church he shall dare to\r\n     disturb, be poured out upon him in this life and in the life\r\n     to come; may his habitation be made desolate, so that there\r\n     may be none to inhabit his tents; may his children be made\r\n     orphans, and his wife a widow; he and his sons; and may he beg\r\n     his bread, and be driven out of his habitation; may the usurer\r\n     consume his substance, and the stranger reap the fruit of his\r\n     labours; may the world be at war with him, and all the\r\n     elements array themselves against him; and may the merits of\r\n     all the saints at rest confound him, and even in this life\r\n     hold the sword of vengeance suspended over him.[440:1]\r\n\r\nThe history of the cardinals is very interesting. The word cardinal\r\nseems to come from _cardo_, a hinge, and contains the idea of principal\r\nor important.[440:2] The term was early applied to the priests of the\r\nfirst dioceses in Rome and in 308 there were twenty-five in the Eternal\r\nCity. Under Gregory I. (604) the word was plainly and commonly used.\r\nStephen IV. in 771 extended the title to suburban dioceses. Anastasius'\r\nlife of Leo III. (died 816) seems to indicate the germs of a College of\r\nCardinals. It was not, however, until the time of Nicholas II. that the\r\ninstitution was definitely created. The number of cardinals varied\r\ngreatly--thirty in the twelfth century, seven in the thirteenth century,\r\ntwenty-four by the act of the Council of Basle, thirteen in 1516,\r\nseventy-six in 1559, and finally Sixtus V. fixed the number once for all\r\nat seventy to correspond with the seventy elders of Israel.[441:1] The\r\nnumber, however, was seldom complete.\r\n\r\nThe paternal solicitude and indefatigable labours of Nicholas II. for\r\nthe restoration and maintenance of the unity and authority of the Church\r\nmet with unexpected success. All western Europe, even distant countries\r\nlike Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Iceland, felt the firm hand of this\r\nstrong Pope. In Milan Peter Damiani humbled the mighty archbishop and\r\nlesser ecclesiastics to repentance for simony and immorality. Robert\r\nGuiscard, King of the Normans, acknowledged papal suzerainty.[441:2]\r\nFrom many standpoints he must be accounted the greatest Pope between\r\nGregory the Great and Gregory VII.\r\n\r\nThe death of Nicholas II. (1061) gave the College of Cardinals an\r\nopportunity to employ the new method of electing the Pope. Hildebrand\r\nfirst sent Cardinal Stephen as a messenger to the Empress Regent to\r\nsecure her approval of the election, but she refused to receive him\r\nbecause she felt that the royal prerogatives had been encroached upon by\r\nthe Lateran Council and besides she hoped to carry out her own plans of\r\nelection. Hildebrand, after waiting some time, resolved to take the\r\ninitiative and summoned the College of Cardinals. The right of the\r\nyoung king was tacitly waived and a new Pope called Alexander II.\r\nelected. The Empress called a counter-council at Basle in which the\r\nregulation creating the College of Cardinals was revoked, the election\r\nof Alexander II. was declared null, and in his place the Bishop of Parma\r\nwas made Pope Honorius II. The German Pope attempted to take Rome by\r\nforce (April, 1062), did gain an entry, but was soon defeated by Godfrey\r\nof Tuscany and forced to flee. A civil revolt in Germany soon led to the\r\nrecognition of Alexander II. and the Empress Regent sought absolution\r\nfrom him and shortly afterwards entered a Roman convent. The continued\r\nquarrel between these two rival claimants of St. Peter's Seat gave a\r\nmomentary check to reformation in the Church. But the battle over papal\r\nelection had been won. The Church was no longer ruled by the state.\r\nTruly could it be said of Hildebrand \"he found the Church a handmaid and\r\nleft her free.\" The contest over simony, lay investiture, and celibacy,\r\nhowever, remained to be carried on by the great successor of Alexander\r\nII. It was this same Pope Alexander II. who gave William of Normandy the\r\nright to assume the crown of England, for which he exacted a yearly\r\ntribute. He also appointed the archbishops for England. Lanfranc of\r\nCanterbury ably seconded the reformatory exertions of the Pope and set\r\nhimself firmly against the sale of benefices and the unchastity of the\r\nclergy. Nicholas II. likewise declared that papal bulls had the same\r\nforce as acts of councils--the first expression of that kind. Peter\r\nDamiani was sent into France to correct the morals of the clergy and to\r\nenforce discipline in the Church. Later he made a similar trip to\r\nGermany. Had not death claimed Nicholas so soon (Apr. 21, 1073) he\r\nwould probably have carried out his intentions to reform the wicked\r\nyoung German king, who was called to Rome to answer for his conduct,\r\nand to punish his councillors, whom he did excommunicate. He bequeathed\r\nthat difficult work, however, to one more able than he for its\r\naccomplishment.\r\n\r\nCharles the Great and Otto the Great both called councils in Rome to try\r\nPopes. But now the Pope has attained such a pre-eminence that he cites\r\nthe Emperor to appear before him to justify his conduct. Verily the\r\nPapacy, with the aid of Damiani and Hildebrand, had got out of the\r\nquagmire which almost engulfed it in the tenth and the eleventh\r\ncenturies. At the same time the imperial right to choose Popes, which\r\nhad so long been exercised and which had been recognised again and again\r\nby the Popes themselves, was taken out of the Emperor's hands and\r\nentirely controlled by the Roman cardinals.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nA.--PRIMARY:\r\n\r\n   1.--Henderson, E.

IV.--His efforts to realise his ideals.\r\n     V.--The investiture strife. VI.--Conclusions. VII.--Sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1073 the Church had been raised from the lowest condition to a\r\ncomparatively high moral plane by the imperial reforms, the labours of\r\nearnest German Popes, the Clugniac reformation, and the Hildebrandine\r\nPopes. The papal crown was no longer the plaything of a Roman noble, nor\r\nthe tool of the German Emperor, but had become largely independent of\r\nboth and a mighty power in Europe. This change was due to the character\r\nof the Emperors and Popes, to the religious enthusiasm of the age, to\r\nthe political confusion in Germany, and to the labours of Hildebrand,\r\nparticularly in creating the College of Cardinals. A positive reform\r\nmovement had also been started in the Church, but it remained to be\r\ncontinued and completed. The time, therefore, seemed ripe for the work\r\nof a great Pope like Hildebrand.\r\n\r\nFor twenty-five years Hildebrand had been the power behind the papal\r\nthrone. He had largely moulded the policy of eight successive Popes, he\r\nwas the recognised champion of reformation in the Church, he had\r\ndeveloped the constitution of the Papacy, he had managed the finances of\r\nRome, he had become the greatest statesman and the shrewdest churchman\r\nin Europe, and he had formed a powerful party to champion his ideas.\r\n\r\nAlexander II. breathed his last April 21, 1073. Hildebrand directed that\r\nthe next three days should be devoted to fasting, charity, and prayer,\r\nwhile the dead Pontiff was being interred, after which the regular\r\nelection of a Pope would follow. The next day the funeral rites were\r\nbeing celebrated in the old church of St. John Lateran. The ancient\r\nstructure was crowded to overflowing and Hildebrand, as archdeacon, was\r\nconducting the services, when suddenly a cry burst forth from the crowd,\r\n\"Hildebrand, Hildebrand shall be our Pope. St. Peter chooses our\r\nArchdeacon Hildebrand.\" Rushing to the pulpit, Hildebrand implored\r\nsilence, but his voice was drowned in the uproar.\r\n\r\nThen Cardinal Hugo came forward, and said:\r\n\r\n     Well know ye, beloved brethren, that since the days of the\r\n     blessed Leo, this tried and prudent archdeacon has exalted the\r\n     Roman See and delivered this city from many perils. Wherefore,\r\n     since we cannot find any one better qualified for the\r\n     government of the Church, or the protection of the city, we,\r\n     the bishops and archbishops, with one voice elect him as\r\n     pastor and bishop of your souls.\r\n\r\nThe crowd approved by shouting, \"It is the will of St. Peter. Hildebrand\r\nis Pope.\"[446:1] Then the cardinals led the popular favourite,\r\nprotesting still and in tears, to the throne of St. Peter, and invested\r\nhim with the scarlet robe and the tiara as Gregory VII. Like Charles the\r\nGreat in 800, Gregory VII. pretended to be greatly surprised at this\r\nelection, which certainly was irregular, if not uncanonical, because the\r\ncustomary three days had not yet elapsed, the people had nominated and\r\nthe cardinals had ratified--a complete reversal of the decree of\r\n1059,--and the Emperor had not been consulted at all.\r\n\r\nHildebrand immediately assumed all the duties of his office, but at the\r\nsame time wrote to Henry IV. stating all the circumstances attending his\r\nelection and saying that he would refuse consecration until the Emperor\r\nshould approve of his elevation.[447:1] The assertions that he asked\r\nHenry IV. not to confirm his election and that he threatened to punish\r\nthe king if made Pope are very improbable.[447:2] Henry IV. was in a\r\ndilemma. He knew that Hildebrand had robbed him of the rights enjoyed by\r\nhis father and predecessors; consequently the German nobles and\r\nsimoniacal bishops urged him to annul the election and thus nip the\r\nviolence of Hildebrand in the bud. He realised the strength of the\r\nHildebrandine party, on the other hand, and feared the results of an\r\nopen rupture with it in the unsettled condition of Germany. The\r\ndiplomatic move of Hildebrand, however, seemed to offer a way for\r\nsurrender under the garb of victory. Therefore Henry sent a trusted\r\nrepresentative to Rome to demand an explanation of the illegal election\r\nof the Pope. Hildebrand simply stated that the office had been thrust\r\nupon him and that he had refused inauguration until the Emperor should\r\nconsent to his election. Hence the Emperor was forced to confirm the\r\naction and forthwith sent his chancellor to witness the installation\r\n(June 30th) of Gregory VII.[447:3]\r\n\r\nThe papal philosophy of Gregory VII. was based upon the\r\nPseudo-Isidorian Decretals. His conception of the Pope is summed up in\r\nthe famous _Dictatus Papæ_ in which he makes the successor of St. Peter\r\nGod's representative on earth, the absolute sovereign of the Church, and\r\nthe supreme feudal lord of the world.[448:1] This ideal he sought to\r\nrealise in every particular. The clergy, according to his theory, were\r\nwholly dependent upon the Pope's will and must be absolutely free from\r\nevery vice and worldly influence in order that they might labour only to\r\nsave men's souls. Hence, he believed in the great need of reformation\r\nand in the correction of all abuses. The laity, from Emperor to slave,\r\nwere entirely subjected to the Pope and his clergy in both temporal and\r\nspiritual matters, and therefore must render absolute obedience to the\r\ncommands of the Church. In his reform policy as Pope, Gregory showed\r\nhimself more hostile than ever against the crying evils of simony and\r\nthe marriage or concubinage of the clergy. But twenty-five years of\r\neffort to cure these evils in the Church had taught him that the real\r\ncause of all the other evils was the subjection of the clergy to secular\r\npower. The solemn denunciations of simony by the Lateran councils were\r\n_nil_ as long as kings and nobles offered each ecclesiastical office for\r\nsale to the highest bidder. It was useless to order the clergy to give\r\nup their luxurious habits and live in ascetic purity as long as they\r\nwere tools of a licentious aristocracy. Therefore the papal ax must be\r\nlaid at the very root of the evil, namely, lay investiture and the\r\nsecular control of the clergy.\r\n\r\nIn his first efforts to realise his lofty ideal, Gregory VII. desired to\r\nunite all Christendom under the suzerainty of the Pope and through this\r\nsubmission to conquer the world for God. On the very day of his\r\nconsecration (April 30th) he sent Cardinal Hugo to Spain to replace the\r\nGothic with the Roman ritual and thus to secure Spain as a papal\r\nfief.[449:1] A few days later he journeyed in person to southern Italy\r\nto secure renewal of the submission of the Normans. When Guiscard\r\nrefused to comply with his demands, the Pope called on William of\r\nBurgundy for troops. Finally he had the Council of Rome excommunicate\r\nGuiscard and all his followers and thus forced their fealty.[449:2] He\r\nassumed feudal authority in Bohemia.[449:3] The Patriarch of Venice was\r\nsent to Constantinople to restore the friendly relations between the\r\nGreek and Roman churches.[449:4] He compelled the Italian nobles to\r\nswear to him the oath of allegiance.[449:5] He corrected the church of\r\nCarthage,[449:6] attempted to win over Swen, the King of Denmark, and\r\nforbade the King of Norway to interfere in Danish affairs.[449:7] He\r\ntreated the King of Hungary as a vassal and rebuked him for recognising\r\nthe King of Germany as his overlord.[449:8] Between the Duke of Poland\r\nand the King of Russia he mediated and had the latter go to Rome to be\r\ncrowned.[450:1] He forced the French King to promise obedience.[450:2]\r\nHe voluntarily sought to act as arbiter between the German King and the\r\nSaxons.[450:3] He demanded Peter's pence from William the Conqueror. The\r\npence was paid, but the oath of loyalty was refused. \"I have not nor\r\nwill I,\" said William, \"swear fealty which was never sworn by any of my\r\npredecessors to yours.\"[450:4] He wrote an open letter to Christendom\r\nadvocating a general crusade against the Mohammedans.[450:5] He asserted\r\nhis right to end war and to dictate the terms of peace.[450:6] He\r\ndeclared it to be his duty to compel all rulers to govern their people\r\nin righteousness on pain of deposition.[450:7] In short, no region was\r\ntoo remote or too barbarous not to come within his idea of\r\necclesiastical unity and of papal suzerainty.[450:8]\r\n\r\nAs soon as elected Gregory VII. began to purify the Church by urging the\r\nbishops to enforce the laws against simony and celibacy which had been\r\npractically dead letters.[450:9] The King of France was called to\r\naccount for his simoniacal practices and under threat of excommunication\r\nforced to promise reformation.[450:10] Early in 1074 a great reform\r\ncouncil was summoned to meet in Rome.[450:11] Four famous reform decrees\r\nwere enacted: (1) Churchmen guilty of simony were forbidden to\r\nofficiate in religious services. (2) Buyers of church properties were\r\nordered to restore them and the traffic was prohibited for the future.\r\n(3) Priests guilty of marriage or concubinage were debarred from\r\nexercising clerical functions. Their blessings would be curses and their\r\nprayers sins. This was opposed to \"once a priest always a priest.\" Later\r\nWycliffe, Luther, and other reformers used this same idea with telling\r\neffect. (4) Laymen were commanded not to receive ministrations from\r\nclergymen guilty of violating these ordinances. Altogether these reform\r\nmeasures were the most radical yet passed. These revolutionary edicts\r\nwere sent to the archbishops of the various countries with instructions\r\nto put them into immediate execution. A special delegation was sent to\r\nHenry IV. to inform him of the results of the council. It was headed by\r\nthe Empress Agnes, Henry's mother, now a nun.[451:1] A solemn pledge was\r\nsecured from the German King to execute the reform measures and to\r\ndismiss the five councillors, who had been put under the ban by\r\nAlexander II.\r\n\r\nIt will now be necessary to see how these reforms were received in\r\nthe various countries. Celibacy will be considered first.[451:2]\r\nHistorically this institution runs back through the Christian era to the\r\nJewish period. Jewish priests married, but were forbidden to marry\r\nharlots, profane women, or widows.[451:3] The New Testament contains no\r\nabsolute prohibition of marriage. The Apostles married[451:4]--even\r\nPeter--and the leaders of churches were advised to take unto themselves\r\nwives,[452:1] but many passages were soon interpreted to favour\r\ncelibacy.[452:2] The renunciation of all worldly enjoyments and the\r\nexaltation of the ascetic life above the social led to voluntary vows of\r\ncelibacy as early as the second century. It was not long until the\r\nChurch came to believe that the unmarried condition was the better for\r\nthe clergy.[452:3] This belief soon developed a contempt for marriage;\r\nand the Popes Calixtus I. (221) and Lucius I. (255) are said to have\r\nforbidden the marriage of priests. In 385 the Bishop of Rome enjoined\r\ncelibacy on all the clergy, and Innocent I., Leo the Great, and\r\nsucceeding Popes followed the same policy. In the fourth century Church\r\ncouncils took up the question, and the East and the West began to\r\ndiverge on the subject. All over western Europe councils and synods\r\napproved celibacy and sought to force it upon the Church over and over\r\nagain. Civil law stepped in to confirm these papal and synodical\r\ndecrees.\r\n\r\nIn 1073, although celibacy had been the law of the Church for a thousand\r\nyears, it had never been universally enforced. The Hildebrandine Popes\r\nand the Clugniac reformers had made strenuous efforts to execute the\r\nreform edicts but had largely failed. In Italy, nearly all the clergy\r\nwere married in Naples, while Lombardy, Florence, and Ravenna championed\r\nthe institution; even in Rome itself the clergy were largely married.\r\nThe sixty wardens in St. Peter's had wives. In Germany a majority of the\r\nclergy were opposed to celibacy and, consequently, they were ready to\r\njoin the Emperor against the Pope. In France the Norman bishops lived\r\nopenly with their wives and families and the common priests of course\r\nfollowed their leaders. This was the situation which the new Pontiff was\r\ncalled upon to face.\r\n\r\nGregory VII. saw that to realise his theocracy the Church must have an\r\nopen, democratic, priestly caste. Marriage would make that caste\r\nexclusive and hereditary, hence corrupt and worldly, and would thus\r\ncripple the Church from priest to Pope.[453:1] He believed that the\r\nenforcement of celibacy would cut the clergy free from the state and wed\r\nthem to the Church. They would live with the Church as her protectors\r\nand not with the world. The Church would be both their bride and their\r\nheir. Hence he had the severe measure of 1074 passed and was resolved to\r\nenforce it all over Christendom. But the endeavour to execute this\r\nradical canon--to destroy an institution which many justified on both\r\nmoral and natural grounds--to rend asunder ties of the tenderest nature\r\non earth--\"to make wives prostitutes and children bastards\"--to break up\r\nfamilies--was strongly resisted all over Europe.\r\n\r\nIn Germany the Pope was called a heretic and a madman for setting up\r\nsuch an insane dogma against the teaching of St. Paul. To make men live\r\nlike angels was childish, it was declared, and would plunge the clergy\r\ninto worse habits. The churchmen declared that they would be men and\r\ngive up their priestly offices sooner than desert their families.\r\nSeveral of the bishops headed the anti-celibacy party and openly defied\r\nthe Pope to enforce his law. The Archbishop of Mainz, as primate, called\r\na council at Erfurt. When he read the decree he was greeted with howls\r\nand threats, and nearly lost his life. Other bishops who tried to\r\npromulgate the act were treated in a similar manner. The threats of\r\nGregory availed nothing.[454:1] The laity, however, probably incited by\r\nthe Pope, made several outbreaks against the married priests, but\r\nwithout any decisive results, and the evil went on. In France the\r\nopposition exceeded that in Germany. A Paris synod repudiated the decree\r\nand an abbot who defended the Pope was beaten, spit upon, and dragged to\r\nprison.[454:2] The Archbishop of Rouen attempted to enforce celibacy but\r\nwas stoned and compelled to flee.[454:3] The Pope fairly foamed with\r\nanger in letters to the French prelates,[454:4] but the hated edict was\r\nnot enforced. In England the Pope made no special effort to enforce this\r\nreform measure.[454:5] Lanfranc held a council to reform the Church, but\r\nnothing further was done.[454:6] In Spain the papal legate was menaced\r\nand outraged by the clergy, when he tried to enforce celibacy.[454:7] In\r\nHungary there was shown the same refusal to conform to the new order of\r\nthings.[454:8] In Italy, Guiscard, the Norman ruler, led the\r\nanti-celibacy party in the south and prevented the execution of the\r\norder. In Lombardy, Florence, and Ravenna the hostility was very fierce.\r\nMilan defiantly quoted St. Ambrose as authority for a married\r\npriesthood.[454:9] Even in Rome itself the decree was executed only with\r\nthe greatest difficulty. But in the face of all this opposition Gregory\r\ndid not waver. Many of the reform party likewise laboured incessantly\r\nwith him to cure the evil. Ultimately, but not in his life time, the\r\nprinciple he fought for was to dominate.\r\n\r\nSimony, one of the most wide-spread evils of the Middle Ages, originated\r\nwith Simon Magnus who wished to buy the power of the Holy Spirit with\r\nmoney.[455:1] The term was gradually extended in its meaning from the\r\nbuying or selling of the power of ordination to the purchase or sale of\r\nany ecclesiastical office or privilege. As early as the third century a\r\nrich matron bought the bishopric of Carthage for her servant.[455:2]\r\nThis evil practice slowly grew in the Church, until Charles the Great\r\nmade Church offices objects of eager desire to the worldly, then the\r\ncrime spread to a fearful extent. The feudalisation of the Church made\r\nthe evil very common from the Pope to priest and even gave it the\r\nappearance of legality.[455:3] Conrad II. openly offered bishoprics and\r\nabbeys for sale to the highest bidders.[455:4] In the time of Hildebrand\r\nthe papal office itself was openly bought and sold. His own teacher,\r\nGregory VI., had purchased the empty honour for one thousand pounds of\r\nsilver. Archbishops purchased their sinecures and in turn compensated\r\nthemselves by selling minor benefices to their subordinates. Bishoprics\r\nand abbacies were commonly sold to the highest bidders by the kings and\r\nnobles. The most ordinary ecclesiastical positions and even\r\nconsecrations to the priesthood were sold. So wide-spread indeed was the\r\npractice that it was generally viewed as normal and legitimate.[455:5]\r\n\r\nOpposition to the evil early appeared and, from the fourth century,\r\ncouncils and synods denounced it. In 829 the Council of Paris asked the\r\nKing to destroy \"this heresy so detestable, this pest so hateful to\r\nGod.\"[456:1] All of the good Popes from Gregory I. to Gregory VII.\r\nattacked the abuse. Even the Emperor Henry III. attempted to root it\r\nout.[456:2] The _corpus juris canonicis_ supplemented by the civil law\r\nmade it a crime and designated the penalties. Priests were to be\r\ndeprived of their benefices and deposed from orders; monks were to be\r\nconfined in stricter monasteries; and laymen were to be subjected to\r\npenance. Every reformer and reform movement began by making an attack on\r\nsimony. But simony was too deeply rooted as a part of the social,\r\npolitical, and religious world to be materially affected before the time\r\nof Gregory VII., who knew that it would be impossible to realise his\r\nearthly theocracy so long as this sin demoralised and secularised the\r\nclergy, and subjected them to worldly control. The edict of 1074,\r\ntherefore, threw down the gauntlet and declared war.[456:3] This had\r\noften been done before, but Gregory now attacked the chief sinners in\r\nselling Church offices, namely, the King of France, who gave excuses and\r\npromised amendment,[456:4] and the King of Germany, who confessed his\r\nsin and declared his intention to repair the evil.[456:5] But this edict\r\nlike that prohibiting celibacy was not enforced simply because the\r\nsecular rulers and the clergy alike were infected with the disease. The\r\nPope resolved, therefore, to wage the war in person and to strike at\r\nthe very source of all simony. For success he relied upon the\r\nthunderbolts of his office.\r\n\r\nThe investiture strife next engaged the attention of Gregory VII. and\r\ntested his power and ability to the utmost. Lay investiture, like so\r\nmany other practices in the Church, had its origin back in the formative\r\nperiod of the ecclesiastical organisation. Under the Roman Empire the\r\nEmperor exercised much power in the appointment of Popes and\r\nbishops.[457:1] The Merovingians and the Carolingians, following the\r\nearlier precedents, both exercised the right of nominating bishops in\r\nthe Frankish kingdom.[457:2] Under Charles the Great and his\r\ndescendants, prelates became identified with barons--the hierarchical\r\ngovernors of the Church with the feudal dignitaries of the\r\nEmpire,--hence arose the universal custom of ratifying the episcopal\r\nelections by regal investiture. The bishop, or abbot, when elected, gave\r\npledges of fidelity and devotion and later paid the feudal fee. The king\r\nthen invested him with the emblems of the office, namely, the sacerdotal\r\nring signifying his marriage to the Church, and the pastoral staff\r\nindicating his protection of his flock. Then he was consecrated by the\r\nmetropolitan. When the bishop died, the ring and staff were returned to\r\nthe king, or to the local secular authority. In Germany the bishoprics\r\nand abbacies almost ceased being ecclesiastical and became little more\r\nthan political divisions of the kingdom. They bore the same relation to\r\nthe sovereign as did the secular feudal fiefs. The holders had the\r\nrights of coinage, toll, market, and jurisdiction; they attended court\r\nand exercised military powers like nobles. By the time of Hildebrand\r\nthe vast ecclesiastical states all over Europe were feudalised and kings\r\nand nobles controlled the appointment of all bishops and abbots. The\r\nhigher clergy were recruited mostly from the worldly nobility, who\r\nunited their religious with their civil duties. This lay investiture was\r\nthe cause of the wide-spread, brutalising sin of simony and must be\r\nannihilated if the Church was to be purified, and to fulfil her high\r\nmission on earth.[458:1] The French king and the favourites of Henry IV.\r\nhad filled their pockets through the most notorious simoniacal\r\ndealings.[458:2]\r\n\r\nBefore the time of Hildebrand, simony, but not lay investiture, had been\r\nattacked. In 1063 a Roman synod forbade the clergy receiving churches\r\nfrom the laymen. Milan and the German court in 1068 came into collision\r\nabout the appointment of a bishop. Hildebrand, immediately upon his\r\nelection, found occasion to praise Anself for refusing installation from\r\nHenry IV. In 1075 he called a council at Rome and had this famous\r\nrevolutionary decree passed:\r\n\r\n     If any one shall from henceforth receive any bishopric or\r\n     abbey from any layman, let him not be received among the\r\n     bishops or abbots, nor let the privilege of audience be\r\n     granted him as to a bishop or abbot. We, moreover, deny to\r\n     such person the favour of St. Peter and an entrance into the\r\n     Church, until he shall have resigned the dignity which he has\r\n     obtained both by the crime of ambition and disobedience which\r\n     is idolatry. And similarly do we decree concerning the lesser\r\n     dignities of the Church. Also if any Emperor, Duke, Marquis,\r\n     Count, secular person or power, shall presume to give\r\n     investiture of any bishopric or ecclesiastical dignity let\r\n     him know himself to be bound by the same sentence.[459:1]\r\n\r\nThis edict was immediately sent to all the bishops of the Empire and no\r\ndoubt all over Christendom. It began the struggle which rent both the\r\nEmpire and the Church into two hostile parties and continued long after\r\nGregory VII. died in exile. It was unquestionably revolutionary, because\r\nPope after Pope had recognised the right of investiture by laymen and\r\nthe matter was generally treated as authorised by public law.[459:2]\r\n\r\nThe Pope opened the skirmish through the council by citing many bishops\r\nfrom Germany, England, France, and Italy to answer to him for\r\necclesiastical offences, chiefly simoniacal; by continuing the curse\r\nlaid on Robert of Apulia; by threatening the King of France with\r\ninterdict, unless he repented and made reparation; by deposing the\r\nbishops of Pavia, Turin, and Piacenza; by treating the German prelates\r\nwith unusual severity; in repeating the excommunication of the German\r\nKing's ministers; and in putting under the ban the bishops of Speyer and\r\nStrassburg and the Archbishop of Bremen.\r\n\r\nThe conflict centred about Henry IV., who entirely disregarded the law\r\nof lay investiture.[459:3] He looked upon investiture as a royal\r\nprerogative, hence he invested the Bishop of Liege (July, 1075),\r\nappointed his chaplain Archbishop of Milan against the Pope's nominee\r\n(Sept., 1075), named a Bishop of Bomberg without consulting Gregory\r\nVII.,[459:4] chose the Abbot of Fulda (Dec., 1075) and also for\r\nLorsch,[460:1] disposed of the churches of Fermo and Spolita in the same\r\nway, and reached the climax when he attempted to force his own candidate\r\ninto the archiepiscopal seat of Cologne.[460:2] Gregory viewed these\r\nacts as an infraction of the King's promises and as showing contempt for\r\nthe law of the Holy See and its prerogatives. Hence he summoned the\r\nArchbishop of Milan to Rome to answer for his intrusion.[460:3] After\r\nthe next appointments were made by the King (Dec., 1075), he wrote a\r\nstern letter of admonition to the king.[460:4] Finally, after the\r\nCologne affair, the Pope cited the king to answer for his sins at Rome\r\nbefore a certain date or \"Be cut off from the body of the Lord and be\r\nsmitten with the curse of the anathema.\" The legates who carried this\r\ninformation to the king were insultingly dismissed.[460:5]\r\n\r\nHenry IV., backed up by the German clergy and nobility and joined by the\r\nanti-sacerdotal and anti-reform parties in Italy, felt powerful enough\r\nto defy the command of the Pope.[460:6] To offset the summons to Rome\r\nHenry called the Diet of Worms (Jan. 25, 1076), at which twenty-four\r\nbishops and two archbishops were present. Cardinal Hugo, who had helped\r\nto make Hildebrand Pope but who was now under the ecclesiastical ban,\r\nbrought forged complaints from Italy and read a false life of Gregory\r\nVII. The Emperor and the bishops renounced their allegiance to the Pope\r\nand formally impeached him on seven grave charges ranging from the\r\ngrossest licentiousness to the assumption of the functions of God\r\nHimself.[461:1] The king immediately sent letters announcing this action\r\nto the prelates and cities of Lombardy, where the news was received with\r\njoy; to the Romans calling upon them to expel \"The enemy of the Empire,\"\r\n\"The false Monk Hildebrand,\" the \"Usurper of the Holy See\"; and to the\r\nPope himself to whom the letter was delivered in the very Lateran\r\nCouncil to which the king had been summoned.\r\n\r\nThe royal herald addressed the Pope in these words: \"My lord, the King,\r\nand the bishops of the Empire, do by mouth command you, Hildebrand,\r\nwithout delay to resign the Chair of Peter, for it is unlawful for you\r\nto aspire to so lofty a place without the royal consent and\r\ninvestiture.\" Incensed by this insolent address, the lay attendants of\r\nthe Pope would have drawn their swords upon the herald had the Pope not\r\ncovered him with his mantle.[461:2] When the tumult had subsided Gregory\r\nspoke to the council in these words:\r\n\r\n     Let us not, brethren, disturb the Church of God by noise and\r\n     tumult. Doth not the holy scripture teach us to expect\r\n     perilous times--seasons in which men shall be lovers of\r\n     themselves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers,\r\n     disobedient to fathers, unthankful, unholy, not rendering\r\n     obedience to their teachers? . . . The word of God calleth to\r\n     us, \"It must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man\r\n     by whom the offence cometh.\" And unto us it is said, in order\r\n     to instruct us how we ought to demean ourselves in the sight\r\n     of our enemies: \"Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the\r\n     midst of wolves; be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless\r\n     as doves.\" And what though at this very time the forerunner of\r\n     anti-Christ hath risen up in the Church, yet we, under the\r\n     instructions of the Lord and of the holy fathers, have long\r\n     since learned how duly to combine both these virtues.[462:1]\r\n\r\nThe council now amidst the greatest indignation urged the Pope to depose\r\nthe insolent king and to put him and his accomplices under the ban. The\r\nking was formally excommunicated and his subjects absolved from all\r\nallegiance to him.[462:2] The churchmen who acted as the king's tools\r\nwere likewise outlawed and a letter to \"all defenders of the Christian\r\nfaith\" announced the curse laid on Germany.[462:3] This was the first\r\ninstance of the deposition of a king by a Pope and was based on the\r\nfalse decretals and the assumption that this power was an undoubted\r\nprerogative of the Chair of St. Peter.[462:4] As a result of this action\r\nboth Germany and Italy were divided into two great parties, the papal\r\nand the imperial. Hoping to save himself by a counter blow,[462:5] Henry\r\nhad one of his bishops pronounce an excommunication and anathema upon\r\nGregory and induced a servile synod at Pavia to reiterate the curse.\r\nCivil and ecclesiastical discord broke out throughout the Empire.\r\nDisaffected nobles took this occasion to conspire against the king, and\r\nto plot with the papal party. Prelates fell over each other in their\r\neagerness to desert the outlawed ruler and to seek reconciliation with\r\nthe Pope. The German papal party held a great convention (Oct. 14, 1076)\r\nat Tribur on the Rhine. The king was in camp just across the river at\r\nOppenheim with his army. The Pope sent his representatives to purify the\r\nconvention and to guide the proceedings. All the sins of the age were\r\ncharged against the king and all allegiance to him was renounced, while\r\nit was declared that the crown would be forfeited within a year unless\r\nthe king obtained absolution. He was ordered to retire to Speyer as a\r\nprivate gentleman until the question was settled and the Pope was urged\r\nto hasten to Germany to pass sentence on the royal head.\r\n\r\nHenry saw that the tide was against him and resolved to follow the one\r\ncourse open to him, namely, to throw himself at the feet of the Pope and\r\nbeg forgiveness. He dismissed his court and his ministers, publicly\r\nrepudiated every act against the Holy See, promised satisfaction to the\r\nPope and reformation,[463:1] begged a permit to visit Rome to sue for\r\npardon, and started for Italy in 1077 to meet the Pope. His accomplices,\r\nprobably at his suggestion, took the same course but by another route.\r\nMeanwhile the Pope was hastening northward to Germany. With excellent\r\ntact and courage Henry made his way over the Alps in the midst of a very\r\nsevere winter into northern Italy, where he was given a hearty welcome,\r\nand then hastened on to Canossa, a strong castle belonging to the\r\nCountess Matilda where the Pope had broken his journey. Meanwhile the\r\ncompanions and ministers of Henry who had fallen under the papal\r\ndispleasure outstripped the king and, with naked feet and clothed in\r\nsackcloth, presented themselves to the Pope, humbly imploring pardon\r\nand absolution from the terrible anathema. With some hesitation, the\r\nPope granted their petition. After a brief penance, the penitents were\r\ndismissed with an injunction not to hold any communication with the\r\nking, until he should in like manner have been released from the bonds\r\nof the Church.\r\n\r\nWith his natural impetuosity Henry resolved to have the humiliating\r\nscene over with as soon as possible. To plead his case he had secured\r\nthe good offices of his mother-in-law, several powerful noblemen, the\r\nAbbot of Clugny, and a few other influential orthodox members of the\r\npapal party. He had even persuaded the Countess Matilda to induce the\r\nPope to give his case a merciful consideration. The Pope's severity was\r\nsoftened by the entreaties coming from so many persons, and it was\r\nfinally agreed that the king should appear before the Pope on a certain\r\nday; that he should fully admit his guilt; that he should express\r\nsincere repentance for the insults he had heaped upon this successor of\r\nSt. Peter; that he should profess full contrition for all his sins and\r\ncrimes; and that he should promise to atone for all former vices by\r\nobeying papal commands in the future and by submitting to such\r\nconditions as the Pope should impose. Henry accepted these terms and\r\nprepared for the act of shame and humiliation.\r\n\r\nOn the stated day he appeared before the outer gate of the castle of\r\nCanossa, was admitted into the outer court and told to divest himself of\r\nevery vestige of royalty. He was then dressed in a garment of sackcloth\r\nand stood in the outer court barefooted and fasting from morn till\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n     And thus [says the biographer of Hildebrand] for three entire\r\n     days, he ceased not, with much weeping and many supplications,\r\n     to implore the apostolic commiseration, until the bowels of\r\n     all the spectators yearned with compassion, so that with tears\r\n     in their eyes they earnestly besought the pontiff to have\r\n     mercy--nay, even so that they exclaimed against the stern\r\n     severity of the man of God as smacking of cruelty: then at\r\n     length, overborne by the solicitations of all around him, he\r\n     resolved to admit the penitent into the bosom of the Church;\r\n     but only upon terms which should either crush him effectually,\r\n     or for the remainder of his days convert him into the passive\r\n     instrument of the papal policy.[465:1]\r\n\r\nThe stipulations of absolution accepted by Henry were: (1) That he\r\nshould appear for trial before an imperial synod to answer all charges,\r\nand that if proven innocent should retain his crown; but if by the laws\r\nof the Church he should be proved guilty he would surrender all claims\r\nto the throne. (2) That until the trial, he should lay aside royalty and\r\nperform no active government. (3) That until acquitted he should collect\r\nno more taxes than was absolutely necessary for the sustenance of his\r\nfamily. (4) That all contracts with his subjects should be invalid until\r\nafter the trial. (5) That he should dismiss from his service all\r\ncouncillors designated by the Pope. (6) That if freed of guilt, he\r\nshould promise obedience and aid in reforming the Church. (7) That the\r\nviolation of any of these terms would _ipso facto_ invalidate the\r\nabsolution.[465:2] Then followed the solemn act of absolution and the\r\nsacerdotal purgation which was taken by the Pope but declined by the\r\nking. The king was then admitted to communion and sumptuously feasted\r\nby the Pope, after which he was dismissed to rejoin his followers\r\nawaiting him at the castle gate. The trying ordeal of Canossa was over.\r\nThe mighty Pope of small, wiry stature and physically weak had\r\ncompelled, by the sheer force of the spiritual weapons in his hands, the\r\npowerful German ruler to humbly bow before him and beg forgiveness and\r\nabsolution. Apparently it was a great victory for the Pope, but the\r\nsequel makes the result look like a defeat.[466:1]\r\n\r\nHenry's humiliation alienated his Lombard adherents. By opposing Rome he\r\nhad lost one kingdom; by submitting to Rome he was about to lose\r\nanother. No sooner was he beyond the castle walls of Canossa with the\r\nheavy curse removed from his head than he began to plot to remove the\r\neffects of his apparently disgraceful defeat. From now on the king\r\nbecomes the aggressive champion of secular supremacy, while the Pope\r\nassumes the defensive. A trap was laid to catch the Pope at the Council\r\nof Mantua and he was practically held as a prisoner at Canossa.\r\nMeanwhile Henry openly violated his agreement, by assuming the rule of\r\nLombardy, and denounced the Pope in strong terms. The rebellious princes\r\nin Germany, urged on by the papal party and taking advantage of this\r\nsituation, called the convention of Forscheim, and there elected Rudolph\r\nof Swabia as King of Germany. He promised to abolish simony, to renounce\r\nthe right of investing bishops, and to recognise the law of heredity, so\r\nwas crowned March 26, 1077. Under these circumstances Henry IV.,\r\nsupported by the Lombard party and the strong imperial party in Germany,\r\nreturned to his kingdom to regain his crown through civil war. Gregory\r\nVII., hoping to profit by the situation, demanded that both kings refer\r\ntheir cause to him as arbiter and, finally, when Henry proved obstinate,\r\nin a council held at Rome in 1080 the Pope renewed the excommunication\r\nof Henry, and again deposed him.[467:1] The German crown was bestowed by\r\napostolic authority upon Rudolph. In the same council the edict against\r\nlay investiture was renewed in a harsher spirit than ever. War to the\r\nknife was now inevitable. Rigid party lines were again formed. Henry\r\ngradually recovered his mastery of Germany. The German clergy in June,\r\n1080, blaming Gregory VII. for the ruinous civil war, once more\r\nretaliated by deposing the Pope.[467:2] A council held at Brescia the\r\nsame year elected Clement III. as anti-Pope. Gregory's efforts to raise\r\nup allies were all in vain. Henry IV. laid siege to Rome with a big army\r\nand at last after a long struggle was master of it. Clement III. was\r\ninstalled as Pope and on Easter Day, 1084, Henry IV. received as his\r\nreward the imperial crown. Gregory VII., defeated by the German warrior\r\nand rescued from the Eternal City with difficulty by the trusty Normans,\r\nwithdrew to Salerno to die with the curse of the Emperor on his lips,\r\nsaying: \"I have loved justice and hated iniquity, therefore I die in\r\nexile\" (May 25, 1085).\r\n\r\nGregory VII. was a man of unquestionable ascetic purity. The charges\r\nmade against him by his enemies are probably untrue. His relations with\r\nMatilda, Beatrice, and Empress Agnes were of the purest character. In\r\nhis efforts and ideas he was undoubtedly sincere and firmly believed\r\nthat he really was the representative of God on earth. It must be\r\nremembered, however, that his conceptions of veracity, justice, honour,\r\nand charity were those of a mediæval despot. He was one of the greatest\r\npoliticians of the Middle Ages, but a policy man controlled by the\r\nloftiest purpose. To attain his ecclesiastical ideal, policy and\r\nprinciple were one and he almost acted as though the end justified the\r\nmeans. After Charles the Great and Otto the Great before him and\r\nInnocent III. after him he had the greatest organising mind of the\r\nMiddle Ages. Few other men can compare with him. He comprehended the\r\ngrand _Civitas Dei_ of Augustine and through the false decretals he\r\nattempted to create the great universal papal theocracy in which the\r\nstate should be subject to the Church, the Church purified and subjected\r\nto the Pope, and the whole Church ruled by _Lex Christi_. Nature endowed\r\nhim with an indomitable will, a restless energy, a clear perception, a\r\ndauntless courage, an imperious temper, an instinct for leadership, a\r\nstern inflexible disposition, a haughty insolent bearing, and a power to\r\ndraw and to repulse. These native talents were intensified by monastic\r\neducation which taught him both the virtue and necessity of obedience,\r\ntrained him to subordinate all affections, opinions, and interest to the\r\none great object, and made him a true child of the mediæval Church with\r\nthe highest ideas of her prerogatives and mission on earth. The\r\nchurchman completely swallowed up the man.\r\n\r\nHildebrand was a wily religious autocrat and not a theologian or a\r\nmoralist. His ideas came from Augustine and Pseudo-Isidore. His\r\nChristianity was based on tradition and historical evolution rather than\r\non the Bible. He denounced simony and advocated celibacy, but not on\r\nmoral grounds so much as because of his sincere conviction about their\r\neffect on his great ecclesiastical machine. The Church to him was a\r\ngrand secular power, resting on spiritual foundations, which had to\r\nemploy worldly means against the other secular powers. Europe was a\r\nchessboard and with the hand of a skilled master he moved kings, queens,\r\nknights, and bishops. His schemes were worthy of the plotter--his\r\ncourage became defiance in danger--his forces were handled with\r\nconsummate skill--his fatal thrusts were driven home with his teeth\r\nclenched--if he seemed to yield it was only to gain a greater advantage.\r\nAs Pope he was over all, the source of all law, judged by none, and\r\nresponsible to God alone. Under this conviction, intensified as the\r\nyears passed, he lived in perpetual conflict, and died a refugee from\r\nthe capital of his great ecclesiastical Empire.\r\n\r\nNapoleon once said: \"Si je n'etais Napoleon, je voudrais être Gregoire\r\nVII.\" There were many points of resemblance between these two great\r\ncharacters. Both were of obscure birth and low origin. Both possessed\r\nthe same indomitable character and threatening ambition. Both were\r\nreformers. Gregory established a hierarchy which still lives; Napoleon\r\ncreated an administration which still survives. Gregory wanted to make\r\nthe Church the master of the world; Napoleon, France. Gregory made the\r\n_Lex Christi_ the basis of all; Napoleon, the revolution. Both wanted to\r\nmake feudal vassals of the world's rulers. Both had an indomitable\r\nenemy--Henry IV. and England. Both used the power of excommunication.\r\nGregory had his Canossa; Napoleon his Moscow. Italy was invaded and Rome\r\nsacked; France was invaded and Paris taken. Salerno and St. Helena in\r\neach case closed the drama.\r\n\r\nGregory VII. was the creator of the political Papacy of the Middle Ages\r\nbecause he was the first who dared to completely enforce the\r\nPseudo-Isidorian Decretals. He found the Pope elected by the Emperor,\r\nthe Roman clergy, and the people; he left the election in the hands of\r\nan ecclesiastical College of Cardinals. He found the Papacy dependent\r\nupon the Empire; he made it independent of the Empire and above it. He\r\ndeclared the states of Europe to be fiefs of St. Peter and demanded the\r\noath of fealty from their rulers. He found the clergy, high and low,\r\ndependent allies of secular princes and kings; he emancipated them and\r\nsubjected them to his own will. He reorganised the Church from top to\r\nbottom by remodelling the papal curia, by establishing the College of\r\nCardinals, by employing papal legates, by thwarting national churches,\r\nby controlling synods and councils, and by managing all Church property\r\ndirectly. He was the first to enforce the theory that the Pope could\r\ndepose and confirm or reject kings and Emperors. He attempted to reform\r\nthe abuses in the Church and to purify the clergy. Only partial success\r\nattended these efforts, but triumph was to come later on as a result of\r\nhis labours. His endeavour to realise his theocracy was grand but\r\nimpracticable as proved by its failure. It was like forcing a dream to\r\nbe true; yet Innocent III. almost succeeded in western Europe a little\r\nmore than a century later. The impress of Gregory VII.'s gigantic\r\nability was left upon his own age and upon all succeeding ages.\r\n\r\nThe strife over lay investiture was carried on by the successors of\r\nGregory VII. Victor III. (1086-1087) renewed the investiture decrees but\r\ndied too soon to accomplish anything. Urban II. (1088-1099), imbued\r\nwith the zeal and ability of Hildebrand, drove Henry IV. out of Italy\r\nand had his son, Conrad, crowned King of Italy (1093). Pope Urban gave\r\nall his strength to the crusading mania and made little progress with\r\nthe Hildebrandine reform. Paschal II. (1099-1118), a Clugniac monk and\r\ncardinal under Gregory VII., renewed the excommunication of Henry IV.,\r\nand plotted with Henry V. to induce him to revolt against his father\r\n(1104) and thus to force him to surrender his crown. The aged Henry IV.\r\ndied under the awful curse of the Church and at war with this traitorous\r\nson. Paschal II. took up the question of lay investiture, likewise, and\r\nhad the practice condemned in the Council of Troyes (1107) and\r\npromulgated the prohibition all over Christendom. Henry V. was forced to\r\nabjure investiture before he could again receive his imperial crown from\r\npapal hands. At length in 1111 Paschal II. entered into an arrangement\r\nwith Henry V., who had appeared before Rome with a large army, by which\r\nthe Pope promised that clerical princes in the Empire should give up all\r\ntemporal rights and possessions received since the time of Charles the\r\nGreat. The Church and its clergy were to live on the tithes and the\r\ngifts of pious persons. The Emperor, for his part, agreed to surrender\r\nall claim to nomination, election, and investiture, and to guarantee to\r\nthe Papacy the full enjoyment of all its possessions and rights. This\r\nagreement was fair and just, though the German clergy objected to such a\r\nwholesale change without their consent. The compact was publicly\r\nproclaimed in St. Peter's before the imperial coronation of Henry V.\r\n(Feb. 12, 1111)[471:1] and aroused a great tumult. Therefore Henry V.\r\nrepudiated the treaty, captured the Pope, carried him together with the\r\ncardinals off as prisoners, and wrung from him ignoble terms of peace\r\n(Apr. 12th) which stated that the clerical princes in Germany were to\r\nretain all their possessions, that the Emperor was to have the full\r\nright of investiture, but without simony, and that the higher clergy\r\nwere to consecrate the nominees after their investiture.[472:1] At the\r\nsame time Paschal crowned Henry and promised never to excommunicate him.\r\nAfter the Pope's release, he had a Roman synod repudiate the treaty and\r\nof course the excommunication of the Emperor followed (1112) and civil\r\nwar was continued.\r\n\r\nCalixtus II. (1119-1124), a Clugniac monk of the royal Burgundian house,\r\nsettled the perplexing question of lay investiture in 1122 by the\r\nConcordat of Worms.[472:2] The Pope agreed (1) that the election of\r\nbishops and abbots in Germany should occur in the Emperor's presence and\r\nwithout simony or violence; (2) that the Emperor should decide all\r\ndisputed elections and enforce his decisions; (3) that the Emperor\r\nshould invest with the lance and receive homage; (4) that bishops or\r\nabbots consecrated in Italy or Burgundy should also be invested by the\r\nEmperor and render homage within six months; (5) and that papal aid\r\nshould be given to the Emperor whenever requested. The Emperor for his\r\npart promised (1) to surrender all investiture through the ring and the\r\nstaff to the Church; (2) to grant \"canonical elections and free\r\nconsecration\" in all churches in the Empire; (3) to restore \"all the\r\npossessions and regalia of St. Peter\" to the Holy Roman Church; (4) to\r\nsecure the return of property held by others; (5) and to give the Pope\r\nall needed aid and justice.[473:1] The concordat was in character,\r\ntherefore, a compromise. It spared both the Emperor and the Pope the\r\nhumiliation of defeat because now both made the appointment--one\r\npolitically, the other spiritually. The Emperor retained but half of his\r\nformer rights, yet could control the elections. The Pope gained \"the\r\nring and staff,\" yet fell far short of what Gregory VII. had demanded.\r\nThe document was full of ambiguity and who was victor--Pope or\r\nEmperor--has been a much disputed question. The concordat lasted down\r\nthrough the centuries as the basis for settling all these appointments\r\nuntil the dissolution of the Empire in 1806. It was frequently violated\r\nby both Emperor and Pope, but on the whole gave general satisfaction and\r\ndetermined many menacing disputes. It was modified by Lothair in 1183 so\r\nas to permit the Emperor to send a delegate to the election.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nA.--PRIMARY:\r\n\r\n  1.--Colby, C.

IV.--Results\r\n     and influences of the Crusades. V.--Sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nMohammedanism,[476:1] like Judaism and Christianity, had its origin in\r\nthe Semitic race. Its birthplace was in Arabia, a desert region. The\r\ntime of its appearance was the seventh century, and its founder was\r\nMohammed.\r\n\r\nThe condition of Arabia at Mohammed's birth (_c._ 570) must be\r\nunderstood in order to have an intelligent comprehension of this new\r\nreligion. Politically the Arabs were united in a very loose sort of\r\nconfederacy. The real government was in the hands of tribal chiefs.\r\nAlthough a prey to Greek and Persian influences, yet the hardy Arabians\r\nhad never been conquered. They were divided into wandering tribes with\r\npractices and customs characteristic of tribal relations. Few cities\r\nwere found among them and many of the conveniences of civilisation known\r\nto peoples of fixed habitations were lacking. Through trading, begging,\r\nand robbing these Arabs had developed a cosmopolitan spirit and\r\nliberality. They monopolised the overland trading routes; carried on an\r\nextensive industry in raising sheep, horses, and camels; cultivated\r\nfruit-growing to some extent; and were very fond of holding great fairs\r\nat which their possessions were exhibited and bartering carried on.\r\nEducationally the Arabs were a very superior people. Arabia was the home\r\nof the alphabet and of numbers, and had developed a perfect language.\r\nThe people had an intense love for poetry and the eloquence of their\r\nleaders was of high order. From the Greeks they had received a knowledge\r\nof the natural and abstract sciences. Of all the peoples therefore in\r\nwestern Asia the Arabs were perhaps the most highly civilised and the\r\nmost progressive.\r\n\r\nComplete religious liberty and toleration were permitted among the\r\nArabs, hence Jews, Christians, Fire-worshippers, and Star-worshippers\r\nwere found among them. The Jews were very numerous especially in Medina.\r\nThe Christians found in Arabia were either the descendants of those\r\nheretical sects driven from the Roman Empire in the fierce controversies\r\nof the fourth and fifth centuries,[477:1] or monks and hermits who were\r\nstill found there in large numbers.[477:2] But Christianity made little\r\nimpression upon the Arabs. It appears in fact never to have fully\r\nsatisfied any of the Eastern peoples--at least no branch of the Semitic\r\nrace has ever taken kindly to it.\r\n\r\nThe Arabic religion was something of a mixture between monotheism and\r\nidolatrous polytheism. Every house had its own idol and every tribe had\r\nits special deity, but above all these particular gods stood the\r\nuniversal god, Allah, by whom the holiest oaths were sworn, in whose\r\nname treaties were made, and yet who was worshipped least and last.\r\nMecca was the religious capital, having been selected by Hagar and\r\nIshmael, and was the home of the Kaaba, built by Abraham and his son\r\nIshmael, containing the famous Black Stone.[478:1] A well organised\r\npriesthood, monopolised by the Koraish tribe, conducted worship and\r\nperformed the sacred rites, which were accompanied by a rather elaborate\r\nceremony. Great religious feasts were numerous, particularly in the\r\n\"holy months.\" By the seventh century the Arabic religion was in a very\r\nlow condition. It resembled the decrepid and effete Roman and Greek\r\nreligions in the later days of their existence. There arose everywhere,\r\nconsequently, a cry for reformation, or for a substitution, and this\r\ndemand soon crystallised into a reform party, which rejected polytheism\r\nand preached asceticism while holding fast to a belief in Allah. It is\r\nquite possible that the members of this party received both their\r\ninspiration and their ideas from the Christian hermits. They were called\r\nthe Hanifs or Puritans. This wide-spread desire for reformation\r\nindicates that Arabia was ripe for a religious revolution and that the\r\ntimes were ready for the great work of Mohammed.\r\n\r\nIn the holy city of Mecca in 570 Mohammed was born. He was connected by\r\nblood with the Koraish tribe and from this source may have inherited\r\ncertain pronounced religious tendencies. Orphaned at six and reared by\r\nan uncle, who was a trader, he made extensive travels of a business\r\ncharacter throughout western Asia. In this way he gained a cosmopolitan\r\neducation, had a wider outlook on the world than was customary, and may\r\nhave come into close touch with Judaism and Christianity. At the age of\r\ntwenty-five he entered the service of a rich widow, Chadijah, and later\r\nmarried her though she was fifteen years his senior. Her wealth brought\r\nhim into prominence and gave him a commanding social and industrial\r\nposition. In his own behalf, now, he made several extensive commercial\r\ntrips. One of Chadijah's cousins was a Hanif and, like the Hanifs and\r\nhermits in general, he was a zealous missionary. Mohammed soon fell\r\nunder the influence of him and other Puritans and soon joined these\r\nascetic reformers. He often retired to the mountains for prayer and\r\nascetic practices and the religious fermentation in his soul in a short\r\ntime produced an explosion. He early became subject to fits,--whether\r\nepileptic, cataleptic, or hysterical is unknown,--and in these swoons\r\nprofessed to have had religious visions. In one of these the angel\r\nGabriel appeared to him and communicated the new faith, the sum of which\r\nwas: \"There is but one God and Mohammed is his prophet.\"\r\n\r\nThus fired with a mighty mission, he began to denounce the old religion\r\nand to propagate the new (610). His first convert was his faithful wife;\r\nthen his bosom friend, Abubekr, received the faith and next his adopted\r\nson, Ali. With this trio of stanch believers back of him, he continued\r\nhis public preaching of the message which had come to him in Mecca, the\r\nvery heart of Arabian idolatry. When his uncle and benefactor, Abu\r\nTaleb, tried to persuade him to desist the brave fanatic answered:\r\n\"Spare your remonstrances; if they should place the sun on my right\r\nhand and the moon on my left they should not divert me from my course.\"\r\nHis converts increased among his own family and friends and also among\r\nthe poor of Mecca. His activity and radical statements aroused the\r\nenmity of the Koraish priests who sought to either expel him or to slay\r\nhim. They soon forced him to depart from Mecca and to carry on his\r\npropagandism among the neighbouring villages. At length, realising that\r\na price was set on his head, he escaped in 622 to Medina. This is called\r\nthe Hegira, or Flight, and marks the beginning of the Mohammedan\r\nchronology.\r\n\r\nMedina at this time was in need of a strong ruler, so Mohammed was given\r\nan enthusiastic reception and was soon recognised as the head of both\r\nchurch and state. With this new power came a change in the method of\r\npropagating the new religion, namely, from persuasion to the sword. Just\r\nwhat the reasons for this change were it is not easy to say; perhaps the\r\nleading motive was that of revenge. At first he began to lead marauding\r\nexpeditions against the merchant caravans of Mecca. Soon he became the\r\nprophet warrior of the Arabs and professed to have orders from Allah to\r\nmake war upon all idolators.[480:1] With this taste of blood and power\r\nMohammed's character and religion both were changed. His military\r\nenterprises were almost invariably successful. By 630 he had captured\r\nMecca and through the great battle of Taif he made himself master of all\r\nArabia. He consolidated his religion and instituted laws to govern his\r\npeople, and finally died at Mecca in 632.\r\n\r\nMohammed was one of the unique characters of earth. Agreeable, true to\r\nhis friends, very simple in his domestic relations, he was deeply\r\nreligious and certainly at first a sincere reformer. His soul was full\r\nof poetry and his intellect at times was frenzied and insane. When he\r\nchanged his method of spreading the new faith after the Hegira, it was\r\nnot due to hypocrisy, nor to the charge made that he became an impostor,\r\nbut can be explained as the outcome of a new situation and new\r\ninfluences which changed both his views and his methods. Certain it is\r\nthat neither he nor any of his devoted followers for a moment questioned\r\nthe reality of the revelation which came to him, nor of the leadership\r\nto which he was called. Although influenced by many of the evils of his\r\nage such as deceit, revenge, and sensuality, still he must be viewed as\r\nan honest revolutionist whose influence has changed the history of the\r\nwhole world.[481:1]\r\n\r\nThere are certainly many striking resemblances between Christianity and\r\nMohammedanism. Both believe in the one eternal God; both accept the Old\r\nTestament; both believe in a revealed religion; both accept the\r\nhistorical person of Jesus; both believe in the doctrine of immortality;\r\nand both hold in common many of the highest moral virtues. Because of\r\nthese resemblances to Judaism and Christianity it has been claimed that\r\nIslam is chiefly a transfusion of these two older religions into Arabian\r\nforms.[481:2] Just how far Mohammed was consciously and unconsciously\r\ninfluenced by these two faiths, with the chief tenets of which he was\r\ncertainly acquainted, cannot be positively stated. From a Christian\r\nstandpoint, however, Mohammedanism has a darker side. Polygamy is\r\npermitted, though regulated, and the marriage ties are exceedingly\r\nloose; consequently, woman occupies a very degraded position. Slavery is\r\npractised and encouraged. Islam commands war on all unbelievers and the\r\nintolerant spirit which this engenders is perhaps the darkest blot on\r\nthat faith. When a comparison between the resemblances and differences\r\nis made, however, the former seem to far outnumber the latter.\r\n\r\nThe spread of Mohammedanism is one of the most remarkable things in\r\nhistory. The means used for this propagation was the sword and the\r\njustification is found in these words: \"The sword is the key of heaven\r\nand hell; a drop of blood shed in the cause of Allah, a night spent in\r\narms, is of more avail than two months of fasting or prayer; whosoever\r\nfalls in battle, his sins are forgiven and at the day of judgment his\r\nlimbs shall be supplied by the wings of angels and cherubim.\" Idolators\r\nwere to be slain unmercifully, but Jews and Christians were given a\r\nlimited toleration under tribute upon submission. Before his death (632)\r\nMohammed had subdued all of Arabia. Under his successors a conquest was\r\nmade of Palestine (637), Syria (638), and Persia (710) in Asia. To the\r\nwestward in Africa Egypt was taken (647) and by 707 all northern Africa\r\nwas captured; and from there the movement spread inland. Europe was\r\ninvaded through Spain as early as 711 and the new faith was carried up\r\nto northern France where the Mohammedans were repulsed in 732 in the\r\ndecisive battle of Tours. Meanwhile, as early as 672, an attack was made\r\nupon Constantinople, but it proved unsuccessful. Islands in the\r\nMediterranean were taken and Italy was harassed for two centuries (9th\r\nto 11th). Sicily was seized (827), Rome invaded (846), a colony planted\r\nat Bari (871), Salerno besieged (873), Beneventum and Capua attacked\r\n(874), and the Eternal City sacked by Saracens under a Norman leader as\r\nlate as 1085. In the eleventh century the Saracens still held southern\r\nSpain and all northern Africa while the Seljukian Turks had defeated the\r\nSaracens and had taken possession of the Holy Land. Thus \"Mohammed, with\r\na sword in one hand and the Koran in the other, erected his throne on\r\nthe ruins of Christianity and of Rome.\"[483:1] The Bible and the Koran\r\ndivided the world into two parts, separated by the Mediterranean but\r\ntouching at the extremities. A conflict between these two great world\r\nforces, each one imbued with a fanatical desire to spread its teaching,\r\nwas inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe Crusade movement was in a certain sense the high-water mark of the\r\nconflict. The causes of the Crusades were both positive and\r\nnegative:--the latter will be taken up first and enumerated.\r\n\r\n1. The spread of Islam and the consequent terror and hatred aroused in\r\nthe Christians, as shown in Spain, France, Italy, and the Eastern\r\nEmpire, produced a feeling in Europe that this great foe could be\r\nchecked and thrust back only by the union of all European nations in a\r\ngreat holy war against their oppressors. This feeling was intensified by\r\nthe fact that many Christians had been captured and sold into slavery.\r\n\r\n2. The fall of the Holy Land, with all its sacred places, into the hands\r\nof the \"infidels,\" first the Saracens and then the Turks, called forth a\r\ncry of horror and a vow of revenge from all Christendom. Roman paganism\r\nhad followed the Roman conquest to Palestine early in the Christian era.\r\nBy the fourth century, however, the cross had triumphed over polytheism\r\nand Christian Emperors and pious persons erected splendid churches on\r\nthe holy places. Constantine and his mother Helena built churches over\r\nthe cave where Jesus was born, over the tomb where he was buried, and in\r\nother sacred spots. It was not long until the location of every place in\r\nthe life of Jesus from his birth to his death was marked by a little\r\nshrine, or a chapel, or a costly church. At the same time many valuable\r\nrelics were discovered such as the true cross and those of the two\r\nthieves, the lance, the sponge, the cup, the crown of thorns, the basin\r\nin which the disciples' feet were washed, the stone on which Jesus stood\r\nbefore Pilate, the manger in which Jesus was born, and many others. It\r\nwas not long until there was a comparatively large Christian population\r\nin Palestine made up of the native Christians, the hermits and their\r\nfollowers, and the devout pilgrims who fairly swarmed to the Holy Land\r\nfrom all parts of Europe. The Persian King Chosroes II. in 611 captured\r\nJerusalem, destroyed many churches, put ninety thousand Christians to\r\ndeath, and carried off the true cross. But Heraclius in 628 defeated the\r\nPersians, recovered the true cross and restored it to the Holy City\r\n(629).\r\n\r\nThe Saracens in 637 made a conquest of Palestine. These Mohammedans\r\nmanifested a peculiar reverence for Jerusalem and gave the Christians\r\nperfect freedom on condition that the church bells should merely toll\r\nnot ring, that converts to Islamism should be unmolested, and that the\r\nChristians should pay tribute, have a distinct name and language,\r\nacknowledge the political sovereignty of the Caliph, use no saddles and\r\nbear no arms, build no new churches, and remove the cross from the\r\noutside of the church buildings. Under these restrictions the Christians\r\nlived in comparative security until Hakam, the mad Sultan of Egypt, in\r\n1010 attempted to destroy Christianity in Jerusalem by razing the\r\nchurches, killing many of the followers of Christ, levying a tax on all\r\npilgrims, and through these acts inciting persecutions of the Jew in\r\nEurope where it was believed that he was responsible for this change.\r\nJerusalem was captured in 1076 by the Seljukian Turks who destroyed the\r\nchurches; robbed, insulted, and killed the Christians; replaced the\r\nlawful toll by extortion; brutally interrupted the sacred services; and\r\ndragged the holy patriarch through the streets by the hair and put him\r\nin a dungeon with the expectation of securing a ransom.\r\n\r\n3. The enthusiasm for pilgrimages rapidly increased from the fourth to\r\nthe twelfth century. This manifestation of religious reverence appears\r\nto have characterised all peoples at some stage of their religious\r\nhistory. Jerome says that Christians began to make pilgrimages to\r\nJerusalem directly after the ascension. The desire to visit the scenes\r\nof the Saviour's life spread like a contagion--it became the mania of\r\nthe Middle Ages--so that by the eleventh century a constant stream of\r\npilgrims was going to and from the Holy Land. The journey was made by\r\nindividuals[485:1] called \"Palmers\" who carried a staff, wallet, and\r\nscallop shell and for whom there was a special ceremony conducted by the\r\nlocal priest or the bishop both at departure and home-coming; by groups\r\nof monks, or of pupils under a teacher; and by whole multitudes such as\r\nthe band of three thousand in 1054 and seven thousand in 1064. Among the\r\npilgrims were found all classes--kings and beggars, male and female,\r\npriests and laity. They went either by routes overland or by sea. They\r\nwere protected by laws and were cared for in institutions along the way.\r\nThrough the endowment by pious individuals hospitals were built along\r\nthe more popular routes. Monasteries served as hotels. The pilgrims were\r\nfree from tolls and were granted many other privileges.[486:1] Charles\r\nthe Great had them protected within his Empire and had a large hotel\r\nbuilt for their accommodation at Jerusalem. It was believed by the\r\nfaithful that such a pilgrimage had the efficacy of expiating all sin as\r\na penance. A bath in the river Jordan was called a second baptism. The\r\npilgrim who had braved all the hardships of a trip to the land of the\r\nLord was upon his return a privileged character in the community. His\r\nshirt was sacredly preserved to be used for his shroud.\r\n\r\n4. In addition to the hardships and difficulties of travel the pilgrim\r\nfrom the seventh to the eleventh century was subjected by the Mohammedan\r\nauthorities to taxation and many indignities. Under the Turks after the\r\neleventh century, robbery, cruelties of all sorts, and even murder with\r\ntorture were common experiences. The report of these persecutions\r\nproduced a marked effect on western Europe,--on the clergy, the ignorant\r\nand credulous laity, and the nobles and kings.[486:2]\r\n\r\n5. The mercenary hope of reward offered by a Crusade against the\r\nMohammedans was another powerful cause.[486:3] Merchants hoped to open\r\nup new fields for commerce and trade.[487:1] Kings and princes expected\r\nto win rich provinces from the Turks. The Eastern Emperor desired to\r\ndrive off a dangerous foe and to regain his lost domains in Asia Minor.\r\nThe Pope and the bishops hoped to subject the Eastern Church in\r\nPalestine to the See of St. Peter. Merchants wished to recover the very\r\nlucrative trade with the East which had been lost through the Turkish\r\nconquests. Debtors and criminals desired to receive relief and pardon or\r\nto obtain wealth in plundering the \"infidels.\" Sinners thought of\r\nobtaining complete pardon for past sins[487:2] and privileges for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n6. The militant spirit of the age and the love of war were aroused to\r\nfever heat by an unquenchable thirst for the blood of the enemies of\r\nChristianity.[487:3] Charles Martel and Charles the Great had set an\r\nexample in the relentless warfare waged by them against the Mohammedans.\r\nAfter their time the Spanish nobles and kings kept up the good fight in\r\nheroic military expeditions. Otto the Great followed the example of\r\nCharles the Great in subduing the heathen of his frontiers by the sword.\r\nThis spirit was aroused to almost ungovernable control by the many\r\nreports of cruelty reported on all sides by the returning pilgrims.\r\n\r\n7. The credulity and superstition of western Europe were an important\r\nfactor in producing the Crusades. The wildest legends were circulated\r\nconcerning the barbarities and inhumanities of the Mohammedans, the\r\nmiracles and deeds of valour, as well as the shameless abuses, in the\r\nHoly Land. The \"signs\" of God's approbation of the Crusades, it was\r\nbelieved were to be seen on every hand. Out of this same atmosphere grew\r\nup the shameless traffic in relics which was rampant in Europe and\r\napproved by the Church.[488:1] Relics from the Holy Land, associated in\r\none way or another with the career of Jesus, were very numerous and of\r\nvery great value. The Turkish conquest had had the effect of reducing\r\nthe quantity of relics, but of increasing the price demanded.\r\n\r\nAmong the positive causes operating to produce the Crusades were:\r\n\r\n1. The sincere zeal manifested by the Popes to extend the true\r\nfaith.[488:2] Sylvester II. in 999 sounded the first trumpet calling\r\nupon the warriors of all Christendom to recover the Holy City of\r\nJerusalem, but Pisa alone made some predatory incursions on the Syrian\r\ncoast.[488:3] Gregory VII. wrote a circular letter to \"all Christians\"\r\nin 1074 urging them to drive the Turks out of Palestine.[488:4] He\r\nplanned to rule the Eastern Church, pledged fifty thousand troops\r\nhimself, and offered to lead the army in person, but the Norman Robert's\r\neastern excursion (1081-1085) was the only fruit.[488:5] Victor III.\r\npreached a crusade in 1087 and promised a remission of sins to all who\r\nshould take part, but he apparently had not yet struck the true\r\ncrusading chord, for Pisa, Genoa, and Venice alone conducted a piratical\r\nexpedition against the African coast. It was left to Urban II. to\r\nsuccessfully launch the Crusade movement in 1095. He took advantage of\r\nthe crusading spirit already abroad in Europe and called the Council of\r\nPiacenza (Italy), which was attended by four thousand clergy, thirty\r\nthousand laity, and envoys from the Eastern Emperor. In an eloquent\r\naddress the Pope favoured a Crusade, but although many vows were taken,\r\nthe enthusiasm did not seem sufficient to warrant the beginning of the\r\nundertaking.[489:1] Consequently another council was called to meet at\r\nClermont in France about six months later. Urban himself was a Frenchman\r\nand believed that an appeal to his own people would meet with more\r\nsuccess. There was a mighty throng at Clermont. After devoting seven\r\ndays to Church affairs, the Pope closed the council by preaching his\r\nfamous sermon in the open air to the impatient multitude. In its results\r\nthis speech surpassed all others in the history of the world.[489:2]\r\nSwayed by its influence the whole multitude shouted, \"God wills it! God\r\nwills it!\" Then they rushed away to seize all the red cloth they could\r\nlay their hands on from which crosses were made to be sewed upon the\r\nbosoms of those who took the vow to wrest away from \"The wicked race\"\r\nthe Holy Sepulchre. Knights and foot soldiers of all ranks now turned\r\ntheir attention to aid their fellow-Christians in the East and to punish\r\nthe insolent Turks. August 15, 1096, was the day set for the Crusade.\r\nThe Bishop of Pui, was made the Pope's legate and Raymond, Count of\r\nToulouse, was appointed to lead the laity.[490:1] The general absolution\r\nof all sins was promised; the \"Truce of God\" was proclaimed and general\r\nimmunity and indulgence was given to debtors, criminals, and\r\nserfs.[490:2] Urban II. continued his travels and everywhere addressed\r\nthe people urging them to join in the pious movement. His work must be\r\nregarded as the immediate cause of the Crusade.\r\n\r\n2. The intense religious enthusiasm which had possessed Europe for two\r\ncenturies, touching all classes and degenerating into fanaticism, was\r\nthe fundamental cause. Chivalry made the Crusade a holy duty to the\r\nChurch and furnished the noblest examples of devotion. The powerful\r\nreform spirit in the Church, growing out of Clugniac asceticism and the\r\nHildebrandine reformation, was an important factor in the movement. The\r\npersonal labours of some individuals supplemented the work so well\r\nstarted by Pope Urban II. Conspicuous among these was Peter the Hermit,\r\nwho was formerly credited with having originated the whole Crusade\r\nmovement, but who was never in Palestine before the Crusades, did not\r\nincite Urban, did not speak at Clermont, and did not stir up all Europe.\r\nHis work was limited to a few months and to a small part of southern\r\nFrance, where he rode through the country on an ass carrying before him\r\na great crucifix and dramatically appealing to the feelings of the\r\npeople. His influence upon other parts of France, however, must have\r\nbeen considerable and he deserves much credit for having helped to call\r\ntogether the first army. Another enthusiast who laboured to spread the\r\nmovement was Robert d'Arbrissel.[491:1] In the Second Crusade this work\r\nwas performed largely by Bernard of Clairvaux.\r\n\r\n3. Thousands in Europe, actuated by honest motives such as the hope of\r\nsecuring spiritual benefits, the wish to expiate sins, the desire to\r\nextend Christianity, the yearning to convert the Mohammedans, and the\r\ndetermination to overthrow a grave enemy to western civilisation and\r\nprogress, gave their means and their lives to this sacred undertaking.\r\nThe cries for help which came from the Christians in Jerusalem and from\r\nthe Eastern Emperor fell on sympathetic ears. All of these forces and\r\ncauses, operating in various ways, produced the most remarkable\r\nmanifestation of military power coupled with religious fervour which\r\nEurope had yet witnessed. It seemed as if Mohammedanism itself had\r\nspread the contagion of its own fanaticism to the followers of the\r\nPrince of Peace.[491:2]\r\n\r\nIn time the Crusades covered approximately two centuries from 1096 to\r\n1291. They directly affected all Europe, northern Africa, and western\r\nAsia. They occurred in an age when Europe was decentralised politically\r\nby feudalism; imbued religiously with the ardour and ideals of\r\nHildebrand; industrially almost wholly undeveloped; educationally\r\nignorant and credulous; and socially controlled by monasticism and\r\nchivalry. In the Crusades there was an arrayal of pan-Christianity\r\nagainst pan-Mohammedanism, or European civilisation _versus_ Asiatic\r\ncivilisation. The Crusades were, broadly speaking, one great movement,\r\nwith a series of waves, which held the world's destiny in its results\r\nand which was a natural manifestation of the civilisation of the day\r\nboth from the Christian and the Mohammedan sides. The purpose of the\r\nmovement was primarily to wrest the Holy Land from the Mohammedans and\r\nto restore it to Christianity. But a great variety of secondary purposes\r\nand motives, both good and bad, induced people to co-operate in the\r\nenterprise. The devout, the romantic, the adventurous, the discontented,\r\nthe mercenary, the criminal, and the sinner, all took part but for\r\ndifferent reasons. From the standpoint of the primary purpose, the\r\nCrusades were a failure; but viewed from their effects on civilisation\r\nthey were a success. It is difficult to reduce them to any specific\r\nnumber, though for the sake of clearness they may be divided into four\r\nmajor Crusades[492:1] and four minor Crusades,[492:2] with an\r\nunclassified children's Crusade. The idea of a Crusade had been\r\ndeveloped by the conflict with the Moors in Spain, the heathen Saxons,\r\nthe pagan Slavs, and various heretical sects; and it was employed, after\r\nthe Crusades ended, in European history for some centuries to come.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Clermont met in November, 1095, and immediately\r\nthereafter enthusiastic preparations were begun for the First\r\nCrusade.[492:3] From March to June of the following year, the rabble\r\nvanguard was collecting in France and along the Rhine--a motley crowd of\r\npeasants, artisans, vagabonds, and even women and children, all\r\nfanatically intent upon rescuing the Holy Sepulchre two thousand miles\r\naway and confident that God would protect them on the way and grant them\r\nvictory.[493:1] This miscellaneous throng was entirely lacking in\r\nleadership and organisation. It broke up into a number of divisions\r\nunited only by their common zeal and similar purpose. Walter the\r\nPenniless at the head of fifteen thousand, among whom were only eight\r\nhorsemen, appears to have led the band. After encountering many\r\ndifficulties in Hungary and overcoming grave dangers in Bulgaria, they\r\nat length arrived at Constantinople. Peter the Hermit with forty\r\nthousand Crusaders separated from Walter at Cologne, and followed the\r\ncourse of the Danube. The Hungarians almost annihilated these pious\r\nrobbers so that Peter with difficulty escaped with but one fifth of his\r\nfollowers and reached Constantinople only through the protection\r\nafforded them by the Eastern Emperor. Emico, Count of Leiningen,\r\nconducted twenty thousand Germans, and Gotschalk, the monk, had about\r\nfifteen thousand.[493:2] On the heels of these various advanced\r\ndivisions followed a rabble of two hundred thousand among whom were\r\nthree thousand mounted knights. This unorganised vanguard was apparently\r\nwell received in Constantinople by Emperor Alexius, who hurried them\r\nacross the Bosphorus only to meet their destruction at the hand of\r\nSultan David in front of Nicæa. Peter the Hermit and with him a band of\r\nthree thousand were fortunate enough to escape.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the main body of the Crusaders was collecting, mostly in\r\nFrance, because the other nations of Europe were either preoccupied or\r\nhad little enthusiasm for the movement. The leaders were nobles and not\r\nkings.[494:1] From the north went forth Godfrey of Bouillon, a wise and\r\nbrave man who with his brothers Eustace and Baldwin led thirty thousand\r\nfoot and ten thousand horse from France and Germany; Hugh the Long,\r\nbrother of Philip I.; Robert of Normandy, son of William the Conqueror;\r\nRobert of Flanders, \"the sword and the lance\" of the Crusades; Stephen\r\nof Chartres, the richest prince of France; and a large number of minor\r\nnobles. From the south came Bohemond, the son of Robert Guiscard,\r\nalready experienced in eastern warfare; Tancred, a cousin of Bohemond,\r\nthe model knight and hero of the movement; Raymond of Toulouse, old in\r\nwar, brave, greedy, and proud, who led one hundred and sixty thousand\r\nfoot and horse; Adhemar, Bishop of Pui, the first bishop to take the\r\ncross and the official representative of the Pope; and many subordinate\r\nnoblemen. This vast multitude, estimated at one million Crusaders,\r\nchiefly French, represented the flower of western Europe. Whole\r\nfamilies, especially of the nobles, arranged to join the undertaking.\r\nThis immense throng was organised on feudal lines. The dukes, counts,\r\nand barons were the overlords and rulers and divided the army into\r\nparts. Under them served the knights on horseback and clothed in their\r\nlong coats of mail. They supplied the military spirit and imbued the\r\ncommon people with a holy zeal. Each knight was accompanied by his\r\nsquire and a squad of warriors. Four different routes were taken by the\r\nCrusaders: (1) Hugh, the Roberts, and Stephen went from the Alps to\r\nApulia, where they were met and blessed by the Pope, then separated, and\r\nmade a scramble by land and sea for Constantinople. Hugh was held as\r\nprisoner by Emperor Alexius until he recognised the feudal sovereignty\r\nof the Eastern Emperor. (2) Godfrey traversed Germany, Hungary, and\r\nBulgaria and reached Constantinople at Christmas time, 1096, where he\r\nmade a compact with Alexius. (3) Bohemond took the sea route to the\r\neastern capital. He was incensed at the compromise made by his\r\ncolleagues with the Eastern Emperor, but was finally won over by\r\nbribery. (4) Raymond, the last to set out, went _via_ Lombardy,\r\nDalmatia, and Slavonia, but was greatly hindered by the hostility of the\r\nnatives incited by Alexius, to whom Raymond, upon learning of his\r\ntreachery, refused homage.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the Eastern Emperor Alexius in dealing with the Crusaders\r\nappears to have been a double one. He had called on the West for aid\r\nagainst the Turks and was answered by an armed horde that threatened to\r\nsweep away his very throne. He had easily rid himself of the rabble\r\nvanguard by sending them to their doom in Asia Minor. He was determined\r\nnow, if possible, to impede the march of these new forces toward\r\nConstantinople. Not succeeding in that he attempted to compel them to\r\nswear fealty to him and then to use them to drive back the Turks and to\r\nrestore his lands. He was a master diplomat and politician and soon\r\nhurried the Crusaders across the Bosphorus. They laid siege to Nicæa and\r\nin June, 1097, it fell. After the battle of Dorylæum (July 4, 1097),\r\nAntioch was captured in June, 1098. In July of the following year (1099)\r\ncame the storming of Jerusalem and its capture with the accompanying\r\nmassacre of the Mohammedans and Jews. The Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem was\r\ncreated and Godfrey was elected Defender of the Holy Sepulchre. With him\r\nwas left a guard of defence consisting of two hundred knights and two\r\nthousand archers. A comparatively small number of Crusaders, who had\r\nsurvived the hardships of the three years' campaign, then returned\r\nhome.[496:1]\r\n\r\nThe occasion and cause of the Second Crusade was the fall of Edessa in\r\n1145 into Mohammedan hands. Jerusalem was next threatened by the Moslems\r\nand was in grave danger of meeting a similar fate. The western\r\nChristians, inspired by thrilling accounts of the survivors of the First\r\nCrusade, and actuated by the usual variety of motives, were eager to\r\nimitate the earlier heroes. Great enthusiasm was aroused through the\r\npreaching of St. Bernard[496:2] (b. 1091-d. 1153), the son of a\r\nBurgundian knight slain in the First Crusade, and a fanatic in ascetic\r\nseverities, who, when Edessa fell, had been commissioned by the Pope to\r\npreach a Crusade. His fiery addresses, kindling a crusading mania in\r\nFrance and Germany, were supplemented by a letter from Pope Eugenius\r\nIII. to western Christendom.[496:3] The leaders of the Second Crusade\r\nwere Louis VII. of France and Conrad III. of Germany, who rallied their\r\nforces at Mainz and Ratisbon. Conrad III. took the old route through\r\nHungary and crossed to Asia without entering Constantinople, because he\r\nsuspected the duplicity of the Eastern Emperor. After him came the\r\nFrench over the same ground. Nothing was accomplished, however, and\r\nafter a miserable failure the monarchs with their few survivors returned\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThe occasion for the Third Crusade was the capture of Jerusalem in 1187\r\nby Saladin, the bravest and most honoured of all the Saracen rulers.\r\nOnce more Europe was aroused to a pitch of pious frenzy.[497:1] The\r\nleadership of the enterprise was assumed by Richard I. of England,\r\nPhilip Augustus of France, and Frederick Barbarossa of Germany. In\r\nEngland Richard I. prepared for the undertaking by selling tithes, royal\r\ndignities, and lands; by robbing the Jews; by taxing all classes[497:2];\r\nand by even threatening to sell the city of London. Equal zeal was shown\r\nin France and Germany. Richard and Philip with one hundred thousand men\r\ntook the sea route from Marseilles and Genoa, while Frederick took the\r\nusual overland route. Frederick Barbarossa met his death in this pious\r\nundertaking and this led to the failure of the German effort. The\r\nestrangement of Richard and Philip resulted, after the fall of Acre,\r\nJuly 12, 1191, in the return of Philip to France. Richard alone remained\r\nand succeeded in 1192 in concluding a truce with Saladin by which\r\nChristian pilgrims were permitted to visit the holy places with safety\r\nand comfort.[497:3]\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Crusade was due largely to the personal influence of\r\nInnocent III.[498:1] Additional causes were the abortive effort of\r\nEmperor Henry VI. (1196-1197) and the preaching of the priest Fulk, of\r\nNeuilly. The leaders of the movement at the outset were French nobles,\r\nwho lacked money with which to finance the enterprise and therefore made\r\na contract with the Venetians who agreed to supply ships and food for a\r\nstipulated sum.[498:2] But when the Crusaders reached Venice, being\r\nunable to raise the amount agreed upon, the Venetians proposed that in\r\nlieu of the payment the Crusaders assist in reducing to submission the\r\nrebellious city of Zara. That was accomplished in November, 1202, in the\r\nface of papal opposition, and then the expedition moved on to the\r\ncapture and sack of Constantinople in April, 1204. The Latin Empire of\r\nConstantinople was then created and a Venetian elected as patriarch, but\r\nthe Holy Land was not even reached. Of all the Crusades this appears to\r\nhave been the most mercenary and the least fruitful of results.[498:3]\r\n\r\nOf the minor Crusades the fifth was inspired by the zeal of Pope\r\nInnocent III.; the sixth was due to the ambition of Emperor Frederick\r\nII.; the seventh was occasioned by the fall of Jerusalem and the pious\r\nenthusiasm of Louis IX.[498:4]; and the eighth resulted from the vow of\r\nLouis IX. and a dream of Prince Edward. The leaders of these later\r\nCrusades were all kings. The fifth and seventh resulted in defeat and\r\nfailure in Egypt; the sixth captured Jerusalem and a few other cities;\r\nthe eighth recovered Nazareth and secured a treaty favourable to\r\nChristians. The end of the Crusade period practically came when in 1291\r\nAcre, the last city held by the Christians, was captured by the\r\nMohammedans. The later Popes of the thirteenth, fourteenth, and\r\nfifteenth centuries repeatedly called upon Christendom to arm against\r\nthe Moslems. Several of the kings of France even took the cross and\r\nproclaimed Crusades, but it was done usually only to squeeze a tax out\r\nof the people. The Crusades had failed after millions in life and money\r\nhad been lost. The people at length lost faith in the movement. Crusades\r\nin Europe, not so dangerous as those against the Holy Land, were\r\ndeclared to be as efficacious as those of a more hazardous character.\r\nThe rise of national states kept kings and subjects occupied at home.\r\nInternational relations made it dangerous for countries to send huge\r\narmies abroad. There had come about a gradual decline of fanatical\r\ncrusading zeal--\"The flame of fanaticism had slowly burned out.\" The\r\nreligious needs were now satisfied by the relics, Gethsemanes, Via\r\nDolorosas, and Calvaries found in Europe. The sale of indulgences made\r\nit unnecessary to go to Jerusalem to win religious peace for sinful\r\nsouls. The marvellous development of Europe in every direction caused\r\nher to forget all about the Holy War and left no surplus energy for such\r\nfar-away undertakings. The warrior became the trader.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the Crusade movement was due to many influences. There\r\nwas an utter lack of organisation and the various movements seemed\r\nlawless and mob-like, due perhaps to the feudalistic basis. The able\r\nleaders were too few and the frequent petty quarrels among those in\r\ncommand demoralised the forces. The common good was sacrificed in too\r\nmany cases to personal, political, and commercial greed. The struggle\r\nbetween the German Emperor and the Pope prevented concerted action on\r\nthe part of Europe. The treachery and inactivity of the Eastern Emperor\r\nhad much to do with the final outcome. The difficulty of colonising so\r\nlarge an area and of absorbing the Mohammedan population, or of even\r\ncontrolling it, was an important factor in the result. Then, too, the\r\nstrength and activity of the Mohammedan forces, an element usually\r\noverlooked, played no small part. As time passed the gradual\r\nindifference and the loss of interest in the enterprise account for the\r\nunfortunate ending.\r\n\r\nThe Crusades are not so important because of the character of the\r\nmovement, but because of the significance of their results and\r\ninfluences.[500:1] Perhaps the most important results were along\r\nreligious lines. Temporarily the Latin Church was extended to the Holy\r\nLand and Constantinople, while the Pope was made the head of united\r\nChristendom, although ultimately the breach between the Greek and Latin\r\nchurches was widened and never again effectually healed. The Crusade\r\nmovement enabled Innocent III. to largely attain the ideal of Hildebrand\r\nas absolute master of Christendom. The longest, bloodiest, and most\r\ndestructive religious war in all history was originated by the head of\r\nthe Church. Through the power thus gained the Pope was able to make\r\nhimself the dictator of Emperors, kings, and nobles. As never before he\r\nregulated the life of all Europe for two centuries and created a\r\nreligious enthusiasm which sanctioned all his acts and pretensions. The\r\nwealth of the Church was multiplied through the foreclosing of countless\r\nmortgages; through large gifts from the living and the dying; and\r\nthrough conquests of lands and cities. Many innovations were introduced\r\ninto the Church. The legatine power of the Pope was developed; bishops\r\n_in partibus in fidelium_ were appointed in the East and after the\r\nfailure of the Crusades fled to Rome where they were made\r\nvicar-generals; the sale of indulgences became a regular traffic;\r\nheretics in Europe were dealt with by crusades and the Inquisition; and\r\nthe Mohammedan idea of salvation was introduced. The Crusades brutalised\r\nthe Church and developed the spirit of intolerance, bigotry, and\r\npersecution. For two hundred years the deeds of the Crusaders were\r\nsanctioned by the Pope as pleasing to God. The persecution of Jews in\r\nEurope was somewhat common and apparently approved of by the\r\nChurch.[501:1] Certain it is that the Pope ordered crusades in Europe\r\nagainst heretics, like the Albigenses, and instituted the Inquisition to\r\nsuppress them; against pagans in the north-east; and against one\r\nrefractory prince by another.\r\n\r\nSuperstition and credulity were increased and the traffic in relics was\r\nsomething enormous. \"The Western world was deluged by corporeal\r\nfragments of departed saints.\" \"Every city had a warehouse of the dead.\"\r\nA belief in the miraculous and in the number of miracles was greatly\r\nincreased. The worship of saints and of images became so wide-spread and\r\ngeneral that there was a veritable craze for the shrines of saints and\r\npilgrimages in Europe were greatly multiplied. Through the Crusades\r\nmonasticism and chivalry were combined to form new religious orders like\r\nthe Hospitalers, Templars, and Teutonic Knights. A marked effect was\r\nleft upon the theology of the Middle Ages. The \"Suffering Christ\"\r\ndeveloped, as is seen in the pictures and crucifixes, because hundreds\r\nof thousands had seen where Christ was born and crucified and hence had\r\nexcited the imagination of western Europe. The Crusades led likewise to\r\na reformation within the Church by producing a general intellectual\r\nawakening, by sanctioning many abuses which soon produced a reaction,\r\nand by leading to a denunciation of all the corruption of the Church\r\ndeveloped through its wealth and power. This reformation was carried on\r\nlargely by the Franciscans and Dominicans. Mohammedanism was prevented\r\nfrom making further aggressions on Europe for nearly four centuries and\r\nmany Christians came to regard that faith more sympathetically, if not\r\nwith some degree of respect, for the Koran was translated into Latin in\r\nthe middle of the twelfth century.[502:1]\r\n\r\nPolitically the Crusades settled the question whether Europe or Asia\r\nshould rule the world. They failed to free the Holy Land, but did free\r\nEurope from Islam. They established the western rule in the East at\r\nleast temporarily, first in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem (1099-1291)\r\nand secondly in the Latin Kingdom of Constantinople. They prolonged the\r\nlife of the Eastern Empire three hundred and fifty years and taught the\r\nGreeks to use the Latin methods of warfare. For a time at least they\r\nsubjected the political powers of Europe to the Papacy under Innocent\r\nIII., but a reaction soon followed. They helped the rise of national\r\nstates on a monarchial basis. Kings were able to emphasise national\r\nunity and to increase their power and popularity by leading Crusades in\r\nperson. Many powerful feudal lords, who divided sovereign power with the\r\nking, were killed or returned impoverished and were unable to recover\r\ntheir power. Patriotism was developed and national hatreds accentuated.\r\nThe abolition of private wars through the \"Truce of God\" promoted the\r\ngrowth of nationality. By the close of the period Spain, France, and\r\nEngland were well on their way toward the rise of a national state,\r\nwhile even Germany and Italy felt the yearnings of nationality. The\r\nCrusades tended to overthrow feudalism by the death of so many feudal\r\nlords; by detaining some of the most powerful as rulers in the East; by\r\ncausing the loss of property through unredeemed mortgages; by the\r\nincreasing power of kings; by the rise of free cities; by the\r\nemancipation of serfs and vassals; by the formation of standing armies;\r\nand by the new civilisation which resulted. Since the Crusades were\r\nEuropean movements against a common foe, a new meaning was given to\r\ninternational relations. For two hundred years after the close of the\r\nholy wars Europe was blessed with international peace. The respect and\r\nhatred of each nation for the others were strengthened by the\r\nassociations and quarrels of kings and peoples. The estrangement between\r\nthe Eastern Empire and the West became more pronounced. Many important\r\nchanges were made in the art and practice of war.[503:1] There was a\r\nmarked revival of the study of law as a result of the creation of law\r\ncolleges and court lawyers soon became numerous and powerful. The\r\nfreedom of the common people was promoted by the overthrow of the\r\nfeudal system; by the growth of free towns and cities which usually\r\nformed an alliance with the crown against the nobles; and by the\r\nemancipation from serfdom which resulted from assuming the cross. The\r\nkings, as a matter of self-interest, championed the cause of the common\r\npeople. Louis VII. of France (1131-1180) declared that all men had \"A\r\ncertain natural liberty, only to be forfeited through crime.\" Bologna in\r\n1256 gave liberty to all within her walls because \"None but the free\r\nshould dwell in a free city.\" Florence in 1280 followed the example of\r\nBologna. Louis X. in 1315 enfranchised all since \"By the law of nature\r\nall ought to be free.\" And Philip VI. (1293-1350) made the same\r\ndeclaration \"In the name of equality and natural liberty.\" A similar\r\nwave was felt in England.[504:1] The House of Commons, created in\r\nEngland in 1295, marks the beginning of representative government and in\r\n1302 the third estate was given a voice in France.\r\n\r\nIntellectually western Europe was far behind the Greeks and Arabs in\r\neducation, culture, literature, science, and art, hence intercourse for\r\ntwo hundred years with these peoples made a marked difference in\r\nEuropean civilisation. The minds of the Crusaders were liberalised by\r\nseeing different peoples, lands, customs, and civilisations often\r\nsuperior to their own. The fanatical hate and bigotry of the early\r\nCrusades were modified by coming to know the Mohammedan religion and the\r\neastern ideas.[504:2]\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of the West was increased in geography and led indirectly\r\nto travels eastward by Marco Polo and westward by Columbus, Magellan, De\r\nGama, and others; in sociology, trade, agriculture, and manufacturing;\r\nin political science; in mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry,\r\nzoölogy, medicine and drugs; in literature by bringing back traditions\r\nabout great events like the fall of Troy, tales of heroes like Solomon\r\nand Alexander the Great, reports about crusading deeds of valour, an\r\ninfinite number and variety of miracles, saintly tales, and pious acts,\r\nand Greek books like Aristotle and Arabic poetry translated into Latin;\r\nin art and architecture by carrying Eastern styles and types to western\r\nEurope. The Crusaders preserved the monuments of Greek learning from\r\ndestruction at the hands of the Turks until western Europe was advanced\r\nenough to receive and appreciate them, though, as a rule, the Crusaders\r\ndisdained the language and literature of both Arabs and Greeks. The\r\nLatin language was again diffused over Greece and Palestine. Indirectly\r\nthe Crusades produced the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nThe social results, while not so immediate and pronounced, were\r\nnevertheless very important. The destruction of feudalism tended to\r\nbreak down social barriers and draw social extremes more closely\r\ntogether; to abolish many social abuses; and to improve the social\r\ncondition of the masses. The rise of free cities tended to associate\r\nsocial equality with municipal liberty. Through the Crusades serfs were\r\nemancipated by assuming the cross; by being made day labourers in the\r\nabsence of free men; and by passing into the hands of free cities, the\r\nChurch, or the king. At the same time social distinctions and barriers\r\nwere weakened by making all Crusaders members of a common army under the\r\nPope and by the common enthusiasm, experiences, dangers, and long\r\ncontinued association of all classes. Chivalry, too, was developed in\r\nits best form and through it originated many of our noblest social\r\nvirtues and sentiments. The wealth, the luxuries, and the ornamental and\r\nuseful arts brought from the East added greatly to the comfort and\r\nhappiness of the West. Through this movement many valuable charitable\r\ninstitutions were likewise created. It must not be forgotten, however,\r\nthat the death of hundreds of thousands in these holy wars left sorrow\r\nand poverty in many homes and filled western Europe with widows and\r\norphans. The debtor and criminal classes were given a chance to gain\r\nwealth and salvation in a popular cause and eagerly embraced the\r\nopportunity. The Crusades also gave rise to such great socialistic\r\nmovements as the begging orders, the Pastoraux led by the Hungarians in\r\n1251, the Flagellants (1259), and the Albigenses.[506:1]\r\n\r\nIndustrially the material welfare of stagnant western Europe was\r\nincreased by the great impulse given to trade and by the widening of\r\ncommercial relations. Through trading with the East, acting as the\r\nmediums of distribution for northern and western Europe, and supplying\r\nthe needs of the Crusaders, cities like Venice, Pisa, and Genoa became\r\nimmensely rich. The cities of Germany, France, and England in turn\r\nbecame secondary centres of trade. The Hanseatic League was formed in\r\nthe thirteenth century. Manufacturing received a strong impetus;\r\nshipbuilding flourished, and factories for armour and arms and leather\r\nand cloth goods sprang up. These new branches of industry were found\r\nchiefly in the free cities where they were controlled by the guilds.\r\nAgriculture and horticulture were much improved by new plants, grains,\r\nand fruits from the East and by the importation of such useful aids as\r\nthe windmill and the mule. Fortunes were lost by the nobles and amassed\r\nby the Church, the Jews, the free cities, and the kings. The coinage\r\nsystem was improved and banking appears to have been for the first time\r\nintroduced. The militant spirit of the nation was aroused and for two\r\ncenturies war was made the chief occupation of Europe.[507:1]\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nA.--PRIMARY:\r\n\r\n     1.--_Chronicles of the Crusades._ Bohn, _Antiq.

II.--Effect of\r\n     the Crusades on monasticism. III.--Origin of the begging\r\n     orders. IV.--Rise and influence of the Dominicans. V.--Origin\r\n     and power of the Franciscans. VI.--Wide-spread results of\r\n     mediæval monasticism. VII.--Sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rise of monasticism[510:1] and the monastic reformation[510:2] have\r\nalready been considered. The spirit of the Clugniac and Hildebrandine\r\nreformation was projected into the twelfth and thirteenth centuries\r\nthrough new monastic orders.\r\n\r\n1. The order of Grammont, founded by Stephen of Tigerno in 1073 with the\r\nsanction of Gregory VII., spread rapidly over France as a reform\r\nsociety. The order lived under an oral rule until 1143, when it was\r\nwritten out by Stephen of Lisiac. Revised under Innocent III., the rule\r\nlasted until the seventeenth century. The order included more lay than\r\nspiritual brethren, also had three women's cloisters, and was generally\r\nrecognised as a reform organisation.[510:3]\r\n\r\n2. The Carthusians, founded at Chartreuse near Grenoble in 1084 by Bruno\r\nof Cologne, were peculiarly ascetic. They still boast that their order\r\nis the only one never reformed.\r\n\r\n3. The order of Fontevraud, founded for both monks and nuns in 1093 by\r\nRobert of Arbrissel in Poitou, sent its members through the country\r\npreaching penance and practising rigidly ascetic lives.\r\n\r\n4. The Cistercians, founded at Citeaux near Dijon in Burgundy in 1098 by\r\nRobert of Molesme, a Benedictine abbot, who, despairing of reforming the\r\nloose and frivolous life of the old order, resolved to found a new one\r\nfor the purpose of leading a life of austere asceticism. The order\r\nspread rapidly and reached its culmination in the thirteenth century,\r\nwhen its cloisters numbered eight hundred.[511:1] In opposition to the\r\nwealthy monasteries about them, the Cistercians had unpretentious\r\nbuildings, simple furniture, plain clothing, no pictures, images, or\r\ndecorations, and a brief, unpretentious ritual. The greatest man in the\r\norder was St. Bernard[511:2] and under his leadership heretics like\r\nAbélard, Arnold of Brescia, and the Cathari were crushed, and the Second\r\nCrusade was preached.[511:3]\r\n\r\n5. The order of Prémontré founded by St. Norbert in 1121--the only\r\nGerman originator of a monastic order after Bruno and who was converted\r\nfrom a rich worldly canon to a pious monk,--combined the life of monk\r\nand canon, soon spread through all countries, and had at one time a\r\nthousand abbeys for males and five hundred for females. The rules were\r\nthose of Augustine, the religious practices were as severe, flesh was\r\naltogether forbidden as food, and fasts and scourgings were frequent.\r\nNorbert dressed himself in plain sheep skins and walked about barefooted\r\namong the poor people preaching and teaching. In 1126 he was appointed\r\nArchbishop of Magdeburg, where he carried on the reforms so dear to his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n6. The Gilbertines, an order originated in 1148 by Gilbert, an English\r\necclesiastic of noble origin, and intended at first for women only but\r\nlater opened to men, planted many cloisters throughout England with\r\npoorhouses, hospitals, and orphanages attached.[512:1]\r\n\r\n7. The Celestines, founded by Pope Celestine V. in 1294, spread over\r\nItaly, France, and the Netherlands.\r\n\r\n8. The Humiliati, founded by John Oldratus, a nobleman of Milan (died\r\n1159), included men and women in the same house. This order was the\r\noutgrowth of the pietistic-socialistic movement in northern Italy and\r\nwas a pronounced forerunner of the begging orders.\r\n\r\n9. The Serviten, founded in 1233 at Florence by seven devotees who\r\nconsecrated themselves to the Virgin Mary, spread to France, the\r\nNetherlands, and Germany and in 1424 was given the privileges of a\r\nbegging order.\r\n\r\nThe Crusades produced two new forms of monasticism--the military orders\r\nand the convents of women established on the basis of useful activity\r\nand not idle contemplation. The military orders were a peculiar union of\r\nmonk and knight whose purpose was, through charity and war, to protect\r\npilgrims to the Holy Land, to care for the sick and to feed and house\r\nthe tired and hungry.\r\n\r\n1. The order of St. John had its origin in a hospital founded in 1065 at\r\nJerusalem for sick pilgrims of both sexes by Maurus, a rich man of\r\nAmalfi. A master and lay brethren conducted it. In 1099, after the\r\nvictory of the First Crusade, many knights joined it, hence to the\r\nhospital duties was now added armed protection for pilgrims. Soon a new\r\nand larger hospital was built near the church of St. John the Baptist\r\nfrom which the order was named. In 1121 Raymond de Puy gave the\r\nbrotherhood a fixed rule which required the vows of monasticism, ascetic\r\npractices, and the duty of armed protection.[513:1] The order had two\r\nthousand members by 1160 and had received great wealth from Popes,\r\nprinces, and private persons. Soon many affiliated branches were planted\r\non land and on islands of the sea. In the thirteenth century the total\r\nincome of the order was eighteen times as great as that of the King of\r\nFrance. After 1187 the order withdrew to Ptolemais and kept up the\r\ncontest with the Saracens for a century when in 1291 it again withdrew\r\nfirst to the Isle of Cyprus, then in 1309 to the Isle of Rhodes, and,\r\nfinally, in 1350 to the Isle of Malta where it remained until disbanded\r\nin 1797 by Napoleon.\r\n\r\n2. Two companions of Godfrey of Bouillon in 1118 united with seven other\r\nknights to protect and guide pilgrims to the Holy Land. To the three\r\nmonastic vows which they took was added a fourth, namely, to fight the\r\n\"infidels.\" King Baldwin II. gave them a residence in the Temple of\r\nSolomon, hence the order came to be called the Templars.[513:2] The\r\nmembership soon increased and a rule was drawn up. St. Bernard\r\nchampioned the order and Pope Honorius II. favoured it. Burghers soon\r\njoined the knights, but the hospital duties were obscured by the feats\r\nof arms. They withdrew in 1291 to Cypress and then to France where\r\nthrough royal and papal favours they soon numbered twenty thousand\r\nknights and possessed vast wealth. Under Philip IV. of France they were\r\ndisbanded and robbed in 1307.\r\n\r\n3. The Teutonic Knights date from the Third Crusade and derived their\r\nname from a German hospital founded in 1128 at Jerusalem, which fell in\r\n1187. The intense sufferings at the siege of Acre in 1190 led some of\r\nthe German merchants to revive the work of the hospital by making tents\r\nout of the sails of their ships and caring for the sick. In 1200 these\r\nhospital attendants organised themselves as a military order, adopted\r\nmonastic vows, promised to help the sick and wounded, bound themselves\r\nto fight the Mohammedans and pagans, and were soon favoured by the Pope\r\nand Emperor. At first the members were all Germans of honourable birth\r\nbut later priests and burghers were admitted. The order became powerful\r\nand wealthy and in 1237 absorbed the order of Brothers of the Sword. The\r\norder removed first to Venice in 1291, and then to Marienburg in 1309 to\r\nwage a crusade against the pagan Prussians. Napoleon in 1809 suppressed\r\nthe order. In Spain to fight the Moors were organised the order of\r\nCalatrava, the order of Aleontera, and the order of Montesta. In\r\nPortugal appeared the order of Christ and the order of Avis.\r\n\r\nThe hospital orders without military service arose in the West and were\r\nbrotherhoods of common people patterned after the order of St. John and\r\npatronised by Popes:\r\n\r\n1. The order of Cross Bearers arose in 1160 at Bologna and in 1238 in\r\nBohemia.\r\n\r\n2. The order of Anthony was endowed by a French noble and authorised by\r\nUrban II. in 1095 at Clermont.\r\n\r\n3. The order of the Holy Ghost was founded at Montpellier in 1170 and\r\nregularly organised by Innocent III. in 1198.\r\n\r\n4. The order of St. Lazarus probably began in the Holy Land and in the\r\ntwelfth century spread over the West.\r\n\r\n5. The order of the Trinity was created by a priest and a hermit and\r\nchartered in 1198 by Innocent III.\r\n\r\n6. The order of Knights of Emancipation was formed in 1228 to free\r\nChristian slaves.\r\n\r\n7. The Bridge Brothers were pledged to build and protect bridges for\r\npilgrims as well as to care for the sick.\r\n\r\n8. Various associations of women were attached to both classes of orders\r\nto serve in poorhouses and hospitals as nurses and assistants of all\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\nThis rapid multiplication of orders and their marvellous increase of\r\nwealth was followed by equally rapid degeneration and decay, so that the\r\noriginal purpose of the monastic organisation was lost after a few\r\ngenerations. The Popes granted them many exemptions. The members of\r\nthese various orders became more estranged from the humbler classes and\r\nwere in consequence unpopular, suspected, and hated. The vows of poverty\r\nwere eluded; the narrow cell became a grand cloister; the deserts became\r\nparks, and the hermits, princely abbots; and the inmates of the\r\nmonastery changed into a worldly aristocracy under a religious name. The\r\npromise of chastity was forgotten, the abbeys became centres of\r\ncorruption and the nunneries almost houses of prostitution.[515:1]\r\nMonasticism resembled feudalism in which the abbot and his monks lived\r\nriotously and waged war upon their neighbours. Such men as Gilbert, the\r\nAbbot of Gemblours, confessed with shame that monachism had become an\r\noppression and a scandal--a hissing and a reproach to all men.[516:1]\r\nSt. Bernard said in 1147 of the region of the Count of Toulouse.\r\n\r\n     The churches are without people, the people are without\r\n     priests, the priests without the reverence due them, and the\r\n     Christians without Christ. The churches are regarded as\r\n     synagogues, the sanctuary of the Lord is no longer holy; the\r\n     sacraments are no longer held sacred; feast days are without\r\n     solemnity; men die in their sins and their souls are hurried\r\n     to the dread tribunal, neither reconciled by penance nor\r\n     fortified by the holy communion.[516:2]\r\n\r\nFurthermore the state and the nobility stepped in and attempted to\r\ncontrol the monastic system and particularly the appointment of\r\nabbots.[516:3] The obligation of obedience to superior authority seemed\r\nto be utterly disregarded.\r\n\r\nThe old form of monasticism, at its best, thought only of the salvation\r\nof its own members and not of the world. Here, then, was an opportunity\r\nfor a great revolution and also a crying need for it. Everywhere\r\nmonasteries were rapidly obtaining exemptions from the bishops and\r\nsubjecting themselves to the successor of St. Peter. While this\r\nstrengthened the Pope, it stimulated conventual degeneracy, relaxed\r\nmonastic discipline, denationalised monasticism, aroused popular\r\nhostility, and spread the report that a little gold would purchase any\r\nprivilege.[516:4] Under these conditions it was perhaps natural that the\r\ninmates of monasteries were frequently recruited from the worst and\r\nmost vicious classes. Such motives as sickness, poverty, crime, mortal\r\ndanger, dread of hell, and desire of heaven would not furnish the best\r\nclass of devotees.[517:1] In one French cloister the inmates were all\r\nprofessional highway robbers. Furthermore, the name monk was rendered\r\nstill more despicable by the crowds of tramps palming themselves off as\r\nmonks. Bearded, tonsured, and dressed in the religious habit, they\r\nswarmed throughout all parts of Christendom, begging, stealing,\r\ndeceiving, and peddling false relics, and were often taken in crime and\r\nslain without mercy.[517:2] The secular priests hated the monks and the\r\npeople mistrusted and despised both.[517:3] The intense speculative\r\nspirit of the age tended to create disbelief in the Church and to\r\nproduce new sects which the Papacy tried in vain to suppress by force.\r\nThe secular clergy were also in bad condition--the upper clergy wealthy,\r\npowerful, immoral, and worldly; the lower clergy characterised by sloth\r\nand incapacity. The need of reformation was generally recognised, but\r\nwho would do it? \"The Church had made no real effort at internal reform;\r\nit was still grasping, licentious, covetous, and a strange desire for\r\nsomething--they knew not exactly what--began to take possession of men's\r\nhearts and spread like an epidemic from village to village and from land\r\nto land.\"[517:4] Heresy, likewise, was making rapid strides and was\r\npropagated by sects whose austere lives and serviceable conduct were\r\npopular because in such a striking contrast to those of the monks and\r\nclergy.\r\n\r\nThe general purpose of the begging orders, which grew out of these\r\nconditions, was (1) to reform the Church from within and not by\r\nrevolution; (2) to avoid the evils and corruptions of wealth by making\r\npoverty an object of admiration and sanctification; (3) to send their\r\nmembers out to save the Church and the world instead of shutting them up\r\nin monasteries for the selfish purpose of saving their own souls; (4) to\r\nsupervise the whole system and to keep the order in a harmonious working\r\ncondition by a rigidly organised monarchial government; and (5) to set\r\non foot a great reformatory home movement which would win the Church\r\naway from the corrupting idols back to a purer and more primitive\r\nChristianity.[518:1] The two prominent begging orders were both Romanic\r\nin origin and not Germanic.\r\n\r\nThe way for the begging orders was partially prepared by antecedent\r\nreformers and orders. Conspicuous among the individuals who were\r\nforerunners of St. Francis and St. Dominic was (1) St. Bernard\r\n(1091-1153) who advocated poverty and denounced the abuses of his day.\r\n(2) Arnold of Brescia (_c._ 1100-1155), a priest and follower of\r\nAbélard, assailed the Pope's temporal power, attacked the wealth of the\r\nclergy, urged the secularisation of ecclesiastical property, and led a\r\npopular revolt in Rome for a republic. He was hanged, burned, and his\r\nashes were thrown into the Tiber.[518:2] (3) Gerach of Reichersberg\r\n(1093-1169), a German monk and canon of Augsburg, left his position\r\ndisgusted at the irregularity of the lives of the canons, went to Rome\r\nin 1125, and was officially appointed by Honorius II. to reform the\r\ncanonry. As the head of the canonry of Reichersberg (1132) he became an\r\nactive and rigorous reformer.[519:1] (4) Foulques de Neuilly (died\r\n1202), an obscure, ignorant priest, whose mighty conviction of the sins\r\nof the world and the Church made him a great preacher, was licensed by\r\nInnocent III. as a missionary. He converted thousands from wayward\r\nlives, reclaimed lost women and founded a convent for them at Paris,\r\ndenounced the clergy without mercy, and struck at every evil in the\r\nChurch. His reformation, however, was lost in the crusading zeal and he\r\nhimself helped to preach the Fourth Crusade.[519:2]\r\n\r\nAmong the movements laying the foundations for the begging orders were\r\n(1) the \"Poor Men,\" or Arnoldists, who were founded in Italy after the\r\ndeath of Arnold of Brescia[519:3]; (2) the \"Poor Men of Lyons\"[519:4];\r\nand (3) the \"Poor Catholics,\" who were founded by Duran de Husce, a\r\nSpaniard and disciple of St. Dominic. These \"Poor Catholics\" based their\r\norganisation on poverty and self-abnegation, sought to convert heretics,\r\nand were approved by Innocent III. although fought by the clergy. They\r\nappear to have been lost in the forcible effort to exterminate\r\nheresy.[519:5] (4) The Beghards and Beguins were founded in the\r\nNetherlands about 1180. At first companies of women were formed in the\r\nBelgian cities to care for the sick, to perform other acts of charity,\r\nand to aid the widows and orphans of the Crusaders. They lived together\r\nin a common house, led a pious life according to a few simple rules,\r\nbut took no vows. They were called Beguins. Early in the thirteenth\r\ncentury similar companies of men were formed and called Beghards.\r\nMembers could leave the order at will, marry or enter any occupation\r\nafter leaving. These orders had their own little houses, each one\r\ndistinct in its organisation, which were frequently endowed by rich\r\nburghers. The inmates were also given to hand labour and did not neglect\r\neducation, although their chief work was soul saving and charity. They\r\nspread rapidly from the Netherlands to Germany, to France, to Italy, and\r\nto Bohemia and Poland. As these associations increased, their members\r\nbegan to wander through the countries, begging and performing acts of\r\nmercy. After the middle of the thirteenth century, charges of heresy\r\nwere made against them and they were persecuted by the Church.[520:1]\r\n(5) The Carmelites, one of the mendicant orders, according to its\r\nlegendary history was founded by Elijah on Mount Carmel. The first\r\ndisciples were Jonah, Micah, and Obadiah; and the wife of Obadiah was\r\nthe first abbess. Even Pythagoras, Mary, and Jesus were considered\r\nmembers. The real origin, however, seems to lie in the fact that Phocas,\r\na Greek monk from Patmos, in 1185 saw the ruins of a monastery on Mount\r\nCarmel and there an association of hermits was formed. The Patriarch of\r\nJerusalem in 1209 gave the association a rule and in 1224 this rule was\r\nconfirmed by Honorius III. The order played an active part during the\r\nCrusades until 1238, when it was removed to Sicily and later to England\r\nand France, where it followed the custom and became a mendicant order in\r\n1247.\r\n\r\nThe founder of the Dominicans, or Black Friars, was Dominic de Guzman,\r\nborn in 1170 in old Castile of noble ancestry. Many miraculous tales\r\nwere told about his mother and his infancy.[521:1] At the age of seven\r\nhe was given over to his uncle, who was archpresbyter at Gumyel de Ycan.\r\nAt the age of fourteen he entered the University of Palencia,[521:2]\r\nwhere he remained ten years as a \"laborious, devout, abstemious\"\r\nstudent. Theology was his chief subject and he became a distinguished\r\ntheologian. While a student, it was said that he sold his clothes to\r\nfeed the poor in a time of famine, and on another occasion he offered to\r\nredeem a sad woman's brother from slavery by taking his place. At the\r\nage of twenty-four (1194), after having studied ten years at the\r\nUniversity, he became a canon of the Bishop of Osma, where he helped to\r\nintroduce the rules of St. Augustine. Soon he was made sub-prior of the\r\nchapter, became very active in ecclesiastical affairs, excelled in\r\nasceticism, which was inspired no doubt by reading Cassian's famous work\r\non monasticism, and became a zealous and eloquent missionary among the\r\nMohammedans and Jews of the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nIn 1203 he went with the Bishop of Osma to southern France to secure a\r\nbride for the King's son. In this diplomatic venture they were\r\nsuccessful, but the bride died before she could go to Spain. Here it was\r\nthat Dominic got his first view of the aggressive Albigensian\r\nheretics.[521:3] From southern France he accompanied the Bishop of Osma\r\nto Rome, where the bishop begged Innocent III. to permit him to go as a\r\nmissionary to the Huns, or the Saracens, but the request was refused.\r\nThe task of converting the heretics of southern France had been\r\nintrusted to the Cistercians, but they had utterly failed to accomplish\r\nit. As Dominic and the bishop were returning to France, they met at\r\nMontpellier three of these Cistercian abbots, who had been sent out by\r\nthe Pope to superintend the duties intrusted to their order. The pomp\r\nand splendour of the abbots called forth this bold rebuke from Dominic:\r\n\"It is not by the display of pomp and power, cavalcades of retainers and\r\nrichly houseled palfreys, nor by gorgeous apparel, that the heretics win\r\nproselytes; it is by zealous preaching, by apostolic humility, by\r\nausterity and seeming holiness. Zeal must be met by zeal, humility by\r\nhumility, false sanctity by real sanctity, preaching falsehood by\r\npreaching truth.\"[522:1] The abbots were advised to send out for the\r\ngreat work men who were imbued with apostolic poverty and zeal. The\r\nabbots accepted the advice and joined Dominic and his companion in their\r\nnew conception of missionary work, but apparently their labours were\r\nchecked in 1208 by the crusade waged against the Albigenses.\r\n\r\nDuring the efforts to exterminate these revolters against the faith and\r\nauthority of Rome, there are two accounts of the activity of\r\nDominic,--first, that that he was a fiery leader of the crusading\r\nparties, and, secondly, that he strongly denounced the war. The\r\nprobability seems to be that he lived quietly in his monastery at\r\nProuille endeavouring to convert the heretics without taking part in\r\nthe war.[523:1] Whatever the fact may have been however, so far as the\r\nhistorical sources go, for the next eight years his life is a blank. No\r\ndoubt he was wisely planning for the future. In 1206 the Bishop of\r\nToulouse presented \"to Dominic of Osma the church of St. Mary's of\r\nProuille and the adjacent land to the extent of thirty feet\" for the use\r\nof his women converts, who at first were nine noble ladies for whom he\r\ndrew up a monastic rule. The convent soon became wealthy and\r\ninfluential. At the close of the war in 1214 Dominic, now forty-four\r\nyears old, had made but little progress. His converts were few, his\r\ninfluence small, but the seeds were being sowed which would return a\r\nrich harvest. His character at this time reveals a man of earnest,\r\nresolute purpose; of deep, unalterable conviction; full of burning\r\nfaith; kind of heart and ever cheerful; of winning manner and charitable\r\nbeyond reason; yet given to scourgings and vigils till nature was nearly\r\nexhausted.[523:2]\r\n\r\nThrough the gift of Peter Cella, a rich man of Toulouse, Dominic founded\r\nin 1214 the monastery of St. Rouen near Toulouse which was the home of\r\nthe Inquisition for over a hundred years. There he gathered some devout\r\nsouls about him and they began to live like monks. The Bishop of\r\nToulouse gave them one sixth of the tithes for their work. This was the\r\nbeginning of the great Dominican order. The next step was to get papal\r\nsanction for the new organisation and for this purpose Dominic went with\r\nthe Bishop of Toulouse to Rome. Innocent III., won through a\r\ndream,[524:1] consented to sanction the order provided some known rule\r\nshould be adopted. Consequently Dominic organised his monks according to\r\nthe canons regular of St. Augustine, which was Dominic's own order. That\r\nrule, however, was almost immediately modified to meet the boundless\r\nplans and scope of the work which held Dominic captive. A grand master\r\nwas put at the head of the order as absolute ruler and under him were\r\nprovincial priors, elected during good behaviour. The friars were held\r\nto implicit obedience, as soldiers of Christ, but poverty was not at\r\nfirst a part of the rule. It was adopted only after the Franciscans had\r\nmade it so attractive (1220). At stated times general and provincial\r\nassemblies were to be held to further the prosperity of the order.\r\n\r\nDominic now wisely took up his residence at Rome, where he was made\r\ncourt preacher, lived in the papal palace, and guided the activities of\r\nhis new order. Honorius III. in 1216 sanctioned the needed changes in\r\nthe rule, authorised the monks to preach and hear confessions\r\neverywhere, and took the order under his special protection.[524:2]\r\nDominic's little band of sixteen followers--among whom were an\r\nEnglishman, a German, and some Spaniards--were sent out into the world\r\nto begin the strenuous life of service. Laymen and ecclesiastics of all\r\nranks hastened to join the order. When the second general assembly was\r\nheld at Bologna in 1221 there were present representatives from sixty\r\nconvents and eight provinces, representing Spain, France, England,\r\nHungary, Poland, and Italy. This same year a secular organisation for\r\nboth men and women called \"The Soldiers of Jesus Christ\" was organised\r\nto convert the laymen, to fight heretics, and to win unbelievers. The\r\nmembers had a distinct dress and special rites and services.[525:1]\r\nDominic died in a monastery at Bologna in 1221 and twelve years later\r\nwas canonised.\r\n\r\nA new constitution was adopted by the Dominicans in 1228 and revised and\r\ncompleted in 1241 and 1252. Members of the order devoted themselves\r\nexclusively to preaching, soul saving, fighting heresy, and in educating\r\nthe people in the true faith. From the schools founded by the order came\r\nmost of their recruits. They were the model preachers of the Middle Ages\r\nand the keenest theologians of the day, producing such men as Peter\r\nLombard and Thomas Aquinas. Among their numbers were found popes,\r\ncardinals, and famous doctors. The first Dominican to wear the papal\r\ntiara was Innocent V. in 1276, and he was succeeded by three others. The\r\nfirst cardinal to be chosen from their ranks was Hugh of Vienne in 1243,\r\nand he was followed by fifty-nine more. Among the famous doctors of the\r\norder were Albertus Magnus, Meister Echart, Johan Tauler, Henry Suso,\r\nSavonarola, Las Casas, and Vincent Ferrier. The Dominicans could boast\r\nof more than eight hundred bishops, one hundred and fifty archbishops,\r\nand the number of martyrs belonging to their order between 1234 and 1334\r\nwas thirteen thousand three hundred and seventy. So influential did they\r\nbecome and so dangerous to the prerogatives of the clergy[525:2] that\r\nInnocent IV. (1254), Boniface VIII. (1300), and Clement VIII. (1311)\r\nwere forced to curtail their privileges. In 1228 the first Dominican\r\nmonk occupied a chair in the University of Paris and in 1230 another was\r\nadded and from this time on they attempted to monopolise learning in the\r\nUniversity. Scholasticism was largely the product of their minds. They\r\nwere very active in missionary work and in 1245 they were sent to the\r\nTartars by Innocent IV.; in 1249 to Persia by Louis IX.; in 1272 to\r\nChina by Gregory X.; and they laboured among the Jews and Saracens\r\nin Spain, and in Poland, Denmark, Sweden, and Russia. They built\r\nmonasteries and churches; and art and architecture are deeply indebted\r\nto them for many of the finest specimens produced in Europe.[526:1] The\r\nhistory of theology, philosophy, and science until the Renaissance and\r\nReformation is little more than a petty controversial rivalry between\r\nthem and the Franciscans.\r\n\r\nThe founder of the Franciscans, or Minorites, or Grey Friars, was\r\nFrancis of Assisi. He was born in 1182 at Assisi of a rich mercantile\r\nfamily. He received a little learning from the parish priest, but\r\nmanifested no love for school instruction. He knew Latin and learned\r\nsome French while with his father on business in France. It was early\r\ndetermined that he should be educated for business. Reports concerning\r\nhis early character show that he was cheerful and kind-hearted, careless\r\nand indifferent to work, vain and fond of fine clothes, prone to join\r\ncomrades in dissipating carousals, and too fond of squandering his\r\nfather's money in banquets for his friends.[526:2]\r\n\r\nAt the age of twenty Francis joined a war party against Perugia. He was\r\ntaken captive and held for a year in prison and this seemed to sober him\r\nsomewhat. Two serious illnesses led him to change his life and a series\r\nof visions determined his conduct (1208). He boldly and suddenly\r\ndeserted his worldly companions and started out passionately on the path\r\nof self-denial. He was now twenty-six years of age. He declared that\r\npoverty should be his bride, and resolved to go to Rome to throw all his\r\npossessions on the altar of St. Peter. Upon his return journey he joined\r\na gang of beggars and exchanged his clothes for the filthiest rags among\r\nthem. Next he appropriated a quantity of his father's goods and sold\r\nthem, together with the horse, to restore the church of St. Damiani.\r\nThen he hid a month in a cave and when he returned looking wild and\r\nhaggard he was hooted and stoned in the streets. His father, alarmed and\r\nangered at his acts called him before the Bishop to force him to give up\r\nhis patrimony. Francis stripped off all his clothing but his hair shirt\r\nand the Bishop covered him with an old cloak. Surrendering his\r\ninheritance and even his very clothing to his father he exclaimed:\r\n\"Peter Bernardone was my father; I now have but one father, He that is\r\nin heaven.\" This was the keynote of his whole life.[527:1] From now\r\nhenceforth he was consecrated to mendicancy, wandered about in a\r\nhermit's attire, devoted himself to the lepers, helped restore with his\r\nown hands four ruined churches, and resolved to work out his own\r\nsalvation in loving service for the weak and needy--an evidence of his\r\ngenuine conversion and a thing radically different from the Christianity\r\nof that period. One day in February, 1209, the text rang in his ears:\r\n\"Provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purses, neither scrip\r\nfor your journey, neither two coats nor shoes nor staff, for the\r\nlabourer is worthy of his hire.\"[528:1] These strong words, coming from\r\nthe priest who was celebrating mass in one of the little churches which\r\nFrancis had helped to rebuild, pierced him like a revelation. \"This is\r\nwhat I want,\" he cried; \"this is what I was seeking; from this day forth\r\nI shall set myself with all my strength to put it in practice.\"\r\nAccordingly he threw away his wallet, staff, and shoes, and put on a\r\nrough grey tunic of coarse woollen cloth, girt by a hempen cord, and\r\nwent barefooted through the land preaching repentance.[528:2] He lived\r\nnow as a follower of the living Jesus,--\"like the birds of the\r\nair,\"--and his childish simplicity and radiating face made him beloved\r\nby the poor and a comfort to the troubled and sick.[528:3]\r\n\r\nFrancis did not have in mind at first the institution of a brotherhood;\r\nhis ideal was rather the solitary ascetic preaching repentance to a\r\nworld of sin, and his strange, fervoured piety soon made him famous in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Assisi. Gradually kindred spirits joined him and\r\nbegged to share his mission. Bernard of Quintavalle was the first to ask\r\nto be associated with him, and in order to learn God's will Francis\r\nopened the Bible at random and read Matthew xix., 21; vi., 8; xvi., 24.\r\nOthers came until his disciples numbered eight. He received them and put\r\nthem under vows of poverty and preaching. The time had now come to\r\nevangelise the world. These disciples were sent out in pairs to the four\r\npoints of the compass, with these words:\r\n\r\n     Go and preach two by two. Preach peace and patience; tend the\r\n     wounded and relieve the distressed; reclaim the erring; bless\r\n     them which persecute you and pray for them that despitefully\r\n     use you. Fear not because you are small and seem foolish. Have\r\n     confidence in the Lord who has vanquished the world. Some will\r\n     receive you and many proud will resist you. Bear all with\r\n     sweetness and patience. Soon the wise and noble will be with\r\n     us. The Lord hath given me to see this--I have in my ears the\r\n     sounds of the languages of all peoples who will come to\r\n     us--French, Spanish, German and English. The Lord will make us\r\n     a great people even to the end of the earth.\r\n\r\nUpon their reuniting, four more were added to their number and Francis\r\ngave them a rule of which poverty was the basic principle and chastity\r\nand obedience were necessary requirements.\r\n\r\nPapal confirmation was the next step. This Francis sought in 1210 from\r\nInnocent III. in a friendly interview at Rome.[529:1] The Pope in doubt\r\nsubmitted the question to the cardinals and it was carried in favour of\r\nFrancis. His rule was approved orally and the members thus came under\r\nthe spiritual authority of Rome and were authorised to receive the\r\ntonsure and to preach the word of God. A second rule less severe than\r\nthe first was drawn up and approved by Honorius III. in 1223, and it\r\nremained the unaltered constitution of the Franciscan order.[529:2] The\r\norganisation according to this rule provided for a General Minister at\r\nthe head, provincial ministers, and brethren, or minorities. Applicants\r\nwere required to sell all their possessions for the poor, to promise to\r\nlive according to the gospel, and to take the absolute vows of chastity,\r\nobedience, and poverty. Each monk was to have two gowns of vile cloth\r\nwhich were to be patched as long as possible. No shoes were to be worn\r\nexcept when absolutely necessary. All but the sick had to walk. No money\r\ncould be received save for the poor and the needy. All who were able\r\nwere compelled to labour and thus earn their food and clothing.\r\n\"Brethren,\" said Francis, \"know that poverty is the special path of\r\nsalvation, the inciter to humility, and the root of perfection.\"[530:1]\r\nA very simple ritual with one daily mass and but little music was\r\ninstituted.\r\n\r\nFrancis sent his disciples out over the whole world to preach his\r\ngospel, while he continued the simplicity of his earlier life, living in\r\na little hut with a ground floor, preaching to and converting whole\r\nmultitudes who came to hear and to see him, and continuing his acts of\r\nmercy and love. He founded a convent of women called the \"Clarisses\" or\r\n\"Poor Clares,\" who became almost as famous as the \"Poor\r\nBrothers.\"[530:2] In 1221 he established the \"Brothers and Sisters of\r\nPenitence,\" a lay order whose members, though living under a rule,\r\nretained their social position and employments, but bound themselves to\r\nabstain from all worldly dissipations like dancing, theatre-going, and\r\nsecular festivals, and to live godly lives.[530:3] This was a very\r\nsensible arrangement because by it Francis enlisted all classes in\r\nsympathetic co-operation.[530:4] Impelled by missionary zeal Francis\r\njourneyed not only throughout Italy but to Illyria, Spain, and with\r\ntwelve brethren even went to the distant Holy Land, where he not only\r\nconverted thousands to Christianity, but even attempted to win the\r\nSultan himself. Failing in this he returned to Italy.[531:1] In his\r\nrelations with Rome Francis was the truest son of the Church and formed\r\nan army trained in piety and absolute obedience which the Pope used\r\nlater to great advantage. For himself, however, he demanded freedom to\r\nlive and to act after his own heart. His life was spared to see his\r\norder cover the world, but at length worn out by his labours and\r\nconsuming zeal he died in 1226 naked and in poverty.[531:2] After his\r\ndeath it is said that the five wounds of the Saviour, called the\r\n\"stigmata,\" were found on his body.[531:3] He was canonised in 1228 by\r\nGregory IX.\r\n\r\nFew persons in the world's history have stamped their character and\r\ninfluence upon their age in a more marked manner than did St. Francis.\r\nHis life is hallowed by countless miracles and it is not always easy to\r\nseparate myth from truth. But a careful study of his career reveals the\r\nfact that he felt the unity of the universe in God and preached it to\r\nman in love and charity as a genuine religious philosopher. With an\r\nunparalleled ardour and spiritual industry, he taught every one that the\r\nsalvation of a human soul comes through self-sacrifice. He and his\r\nfollowers aimed to realise the simplicity of Christ and his apostles.\r\n\"No human creature since Christ has more fully incarnated the ideal of\r\nChristianity than Francis.\"[531:4] His chief happiness was in\r\nministering to the needs of his fellow creatures. \"The perfection of\r\ngladness,\" he said \"consists not in working miracles, in curing the\r\nsick, expelling devils, or raising the dead; nor in learning and\r\nknowledge of all things; nor in eloquence to convert the world, but in\r\nbearing all ills and injuries and injustices and despiteful treatment\r\nwith patience and humility.\" Through his insane, extravagant asceticism\r\nthere shines forth a patience, humility, and depth of love necessary to\r\noppose the pride and cruelty of his age. He inculcated the gospel of\r\ncheerfulness and declared that gloom and sadness were the deadly weapons\r\nof Satan. He had a poetic soul, was passionately fond of animals and\r\nflowers--called them his brothers and sisters--and preached some\r\nbeautiful sermons to the trees, the fish in the streams, the\r\nbirds,[532:1] and the posies. He wrote some rugged and touching\r\nverse--\"The first broken utterances of a new voice which was soon to\r\nfill the world.\"[532:2] \"Of all saints St. Francis was the most\r\nblameless and gentle. Francis was emphatically the saint of the people,\r\nof a poetic people, like the Italians.\"[532:3] In many ways he was the\r\nforerunner of Dante. In prayer, in picture, and in song, the worship of\r\nSt. Francis vied with that of Jesus. In story and legend he soon\r\noutstripped Christ.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1219 that St. Francis sent his disciples out to evangelise the\r\nworld. Those who went to Germany and Hungary were regarded as heretics\r\nand roughly treated. In France at first they were mistaken for Cathari\r\nand an appeal was made to the Pope concerning them. Five suffered\r\nmartyrdom in Morocco. They soon spread to all parts of the world and\r\nmany of them perished as martyrs in the cause they had espoused. When\r\nSt. Francis held his first chapter in 1221 three thousand members[533:1]\r\nwere present and Provincial Masters had been appointed in all European\r\ncountries. In 1260 there were thirty-three provinces, one hundred\r\neighty-two guardianships, eight thousand monasteries and two hundred\r\nthousand friars. The order has produced five Popes and many cardinals,\r\nbishops, theologians, writers, and poets.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the two founders and their orders reveals some\r\ninteresting facts. Both leaders were born about the same time, St.\r\nDominic being the older by twelve years. Both were of Romance\r\norigin--one of noble, the other of ignoble birth. The early life of each\r\nwas wholly dissimilar in disposition, education, and relation to the\r\nChurch. The causes operating to make them reformers were very different.\r\nSt. Dominic dreamed of an aggressive, skilfully-trained body of\r\npreachers of simple life to convert the heretics and to instruct the\r\northodox, thus keeping them firm. St. Francis on the other hand made\r\npoverty the first Christian grace and sought to lead all men back to\r\nJesus as the great model. One laboured for doctrinal orthodoxy, the\r\nother for personal piety. Both applied to Innocent III. about the same\r\ntime for a permit to found a new order and both were successful. Each\r\norder in its purpose was reformatory and in the monastic world\r\nrevolutionary.[533:2] In organisation the two orders were essentially\r\nthe same: each had a governor-general at Rome, provincial governors in\r\nthe provinces, priors or guardians over single cloisters, which were\r\nsimply \"homes\" and not convents in the old sense and demanded a certain\r\ntype of life for the members. The vows were essentially the same,\r\nalthough the Franciscans originated and the Dominicans adopted that of\r\npoverty. Both orders devoted themselves to preaching and to saving\r\nsouls.\r\n\r\nEducation, art, morality, and religion of the later Middle Ages were in\r\na large measure moulded by the influence of these two organisations.\r\nBoth had great scholars, preachers, teachers, higher clergy, and popes.\r\n\r\n     Whenever in the thirteenth century we find a man towering\r\n     above his fellows, we are almost sure to trace him to one of\r\n     the mendicant orders. Raymond of Pennaforte, Alexander Hales,\r\n     Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventura, Roger Bacon, and\r\n     Duns Scotus are names which show how irresistibly the men of\r\n     highest gifts were glad to seek among the Dominicans or\r\n     Franciscans their ideal life.[534:1]\r\n\r\nThe Franciscans were realists and Scottists; the Dominicans, nominalists\r\nand Thomists. The Franciscans believed in the immaculate conception; the\r\nDominicans denied it. Both came into conflict with the secular clergy.\r\nThey could not say mass, but were very popular confessors and thus\r\ntended to deprive the clergy of support and revenues and even threatened\r\nto supersede the old ecclesiastical system. Women and the pious as a\r\nrule upheld the begging orders, while the state, the soldiers, and the\r\nmen took the part of the clergy. In both, the individual was compelled\r\nto remain poor, while the society became dangerously rich. The\r\nDominicans were aristocratic; the Franciscans democratic.\r\n\r\nEach order borrowed something from the other: St. Francis took St.\r\nDominic's idea of itinerant preachers; St. Dominic adopted St. Francis's\r\nplan of poverty. Both became quickly popular and both had exemptions and\r\nprivileges showered upon them by Rome.[535:1] Their members could not be\r\nexcommunicated by any bishop and were exempt from all local jurisdiction\r\nsave that of their own order.[535:2] They had a right to live freely in\r\nexcommunicated lands. Being directly responsible to the Pope alone, they\r\nwere used by him to raise money, to preach crusades, to sell\r\nindulgences, to execute excommunications, to serve as spies and secret\r\npolice, and to act as papal legates on all kinds of missions. In\r\naddition to practically usurping and monopolising the functions of\r\npreaching and confession and granting absolution, they were finally\r\npermitted to celebrate mass on portable altars.[535:3] In return for\r\nthese privileges each order gave the Pope a vast army which overran\r\nEurope in his name. Both orders helped to carry on the work of the\r\nInquisition.[535:4] Both laboured incessantly in the missionary field\r\nand from the thirteenth century onward they were the great missionary\r\npioneers in Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. Both had a tertiary order\r\nof laymen which went far to remove the barrier between the ecclesiastic\r\nand the people. From this comparison it will be seen that the\r\nFranciscans and Dominicans were much more alike than unlike in their\r\norigin, leaders, aims, methods, and results. After the thirteenth\r\ncentury both departed from their original ideals, became corrupt,\r\nworldly, and very unpopular.\r\n\r\nA third begging order was created in 1243, when Pope Innocent IV.\r\nauthorised the organisation of a band of Italian monks under the rule of\r\nSt. Augustine. Lanfranc Septala of Milan was made general of the order\r\nand provincial rulers were appointed for Italy, Spain, France, and\r\nGermany. Under Alexander IV. in 1256 they assumed the rights and duties\r\nof a mendicant order and in 1287 they were taken under the particular\r\nprotection of the Pope. They soon spread rapidly over western Europe and\r\nby the fifteenth century covered forty-two provinces, had two thousand\r\nmonasteries, and thirty thousand monks. It was this order which young\r\nMartin Luther entered in 1505 at Erfurt.\r\n\r\nNo better summary of the general results of the begging orders has ever\r\nbeen made than that of Lea when he says:\r\n\r\n     The Mendicants came upon Christendom like a revelation--men\r\n     who had abandoned all that was enticing in life to imitate the\r\n     Apostles, to convert the sinner and unbeliever, to arouse the\r\n     slumbering sense of mankind, to instruct the ignorant, to\r\n     offer salvation to all; in short to do what the Church was\r\n     paid so enormously in wealth and privileges and power for\r\n     neglecting. Wandering on foot over the face of Europe, under\r\n     burning suns or chilling blasts, rejecting alms in money but\r\n     receiving thankfully whatever coarse food might be set before\r\n     the wayfarer, or enduring hunger in silent resignation, taking\r\n     no thought for the morrow, but busied eternally in the work of\r\n     snatching souls from Satan, and lifting men up from the sordid\r\n     cares of daily life, of ministering to their infirmities and\r\n     of bringing to their darkened souls a glimpse of heavenly\r\n     light--such was the aspect in which the earliest Dominicans\r\n     and Franciscans presented themselves to the eyes of men who\r\n     had been accustomed to see in the ecclesiastic only the\r\n     sensual worldling intent solely upon the indulgence of his\r\n     appetites.[537:1]\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     In the busy world of the 13th century there was then no agency\r\n     more active than that of the Mendicant Orders, for good and\r\n     for evil. On the whole perhaps the good preponderated, for\r\n     they undoubtedly aided in postponing a revolution for which\r\n     the world was not yet ready. Though the self-abnegation of\r\n     their earlier days was a quality too rare and perishable to be\r\n     long preserved, and though they soon sank to the level of the\r\n     social order around them, yet their work had not been\r\n     altogether lost.[537:2]\r\n\r\nThe degeneration which soon crept into both orders was not allowed to\r\nincrease without efforts of reformation. Within fifty years after the\r\ndeath of St. Francis, Bonaventura, the governor-general who succeeded\r\nhim, complained that the vow of poverty had broken down, that the\r\nFranciscans were more entangled in money matters than the older orders\r\nand that vast sums were lavished on costly buildings. He declared that\r\nthe friars were idle, lazy beggars given to vice and so brazen that they\r\nwere feared as much as highway robbers. He said further that they made\r\nundesirable acquaintances and thus gave rise to grave scandals, and that\r\nthey were too greedy of burial and legacy fees and thus encroached upon\r\nthe parochial clergy. St. Francis himself had been compelled to resign\r\nhis generalship on account of the abuses and offered to resume it only\r\non condition of reformation.[537:3] The second general, Elias, the\r\nshrewdest politician in Italy, was removed by Pope Gregory IX. It was\r\nhigh time therefore that a high-minded reformer like Bonaventura\r\nappeared, for by a series of steps the Franciscans changed from a body\r\nof pietists to a band of the boldest swindlers. As preaching and\r\nsoul-saving died out, the begging propensities were developed. As early\r\nas 1233 Gregory IX. told the Dominicans that their poverty should be\r\ngenuine and not hypocritical.[538:1] The wide use of the friars by the\r\nPope for political purposes still further diverted them from their\r\nspiritual functions and tended to make them worldly.\r\n\r\nAs a result the Franciscans soon broke into two parties: (1) The\r\nliberals who were not averse to dropping the vow of poverty and\r\nimitating the older monastic orders were very strong. (2) The reform\r\nparty who desired to adhere rigidly to the preaching and practice of St.\r\nFrancis were probably a minority and were weakened by subdivisions. One\r\nfaction of the strict party was called Spirituales,[538:2] and in turn\r\nwas represented by the Cæsarins who revolted against the public activity\r\nof Elias and were punished as rebels; the Celestines who were permitted\r\nto exist as a separate order by Pope Celestine V. in 1294, and were\r\nlater denounced as heretics; the congregation of Narbonne which was\r\nformed in 1282; the Clarenins who were accused of heresy in 1318; and\r\nthe congregation of Philip of Nyarca which was formed in 1308. A second\r\nreform element within the rigid party were the Fratricelli, authorised\r\nby Celestine V., who became revolutionists, repudiated the Papacy, left\r\nthe Church, joined the Beghards, thought that they were possessed with\r\nthe Holy Spirit and were exempt from sin, and repudiated the sacraments\r\nof the Church. They were condemned as heretics and the Inquisition was\r\nturned against them in Italy, Sicily, and southern France, but they\r\nlasted until the Reformation. Later reform factions among the\r\nFranciscans were the Capuchins (1526), Minims (1453), Observants (1415),\r\nand Recollects. These internal reformers failed to change the order\r\nbecause the rule of St. Francis was utterly incompatible with social\r\nlife in any form.\r\n\r\nFor three centuries the Franciscans and Dominicans practically ruled the\r\nChurch and state. They filled the highest civil ecclesiastical\r\npositions; they taught authoritatively in the universities and churches;\r\nthey maintained the prerogatives of the Roman Pontiffs against kings,\r\nbishops, and heretics; and they were to the Church before the\r\nReformation what the Jesuits were after the Reformation. The Mendicants\r\nincreased so rapidly however that they soon became a burden to the\r\nChurch and the people. Hence in 1272 Gregory X. in the Council of Lyons\r\nsuppressed the \"extravagant multitude\" by reducing them to four orders:\r\nthe Dominicans, the Franciscans, the Carmelites, and the Augustinians.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES.\r\n\r\nA.--PRIMARY:\r\n\r\n   1.--Gerard de Frachet, _Lives of the Brethren_.\r\n\r\n   2.--Eales, S.

VIII.--Sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany antecedent forces prepared the way for the ascendency of the Church\r\nunder the greatest of all the Popes, Innocent III. The promulgation of\r\nthe Petrine theory and its development for many centuries afforded the\r\nfundamental groundwork upon which the Church at its height was built.\r\nThe Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals furnished the constitutional basis for\r\nthe work of this master Pope and their most complete realisation\r\nculminated under his rule. The Hildebrandine reformation, inspired by\r\nthe Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals, was largely attained under Innocent III.\r\nThe reorganisation of the College of Cardinals tended to purify papal\r\nelections. The administrative reforms of Hildebrand restored order in\r\nthe Church and subjected the councils and clergy to the Pope. The moral\r\nreforms attempted sought: (1) to enforce clerical celibacy and, although\r\na failure immediately, ultimately were successful; (2) to abolish\r\nsimony--a task that was left for the great Innocent; (3) and to\r\nannihilate lay investiture which was partly successful in the Concordat\r\nof Worms formed in 1122. Gregory VII. had sought also, to subject the\r\nstate to the Church. Some of his successors, notably Urban II., Pascal\r\nII., Calixtus II., and Alexander III.,[545:1] strove valiantly to\r\nrealize this same purpose. The complete realisation of all these hopes,\r\nhowever, was left for Innocent III.\r\n\r\nInnocent III. was born in 1160 at Anagni and bore the name Lothario. He\r\nwas the fourth son of a rich noble Italian family named Conti.[545:2]\r\nHis father was Count Trasimundo of Segni and his mother belonged to the\r\nnoble Roman Scotti family which had given the Church nine Popes and\r\nthirteen cardinals. It is not unreasonable to believe, therefore, that\r\nthe young Lothario inherited from his ancestors both a capacity and a\r\ndesire for an important position in the Church. His education was the\r\nbest obtainable at that day and was begun under the direction of two\r\ncardinal uncles. He was sent to Rome to one of the schools attached to\r\nall the churches and there received his elementary education and\r\nlikewise his preparation for the university. When properly qualified he\r\nentered the University of Paris where he studied philosophy and theology\r\nunder the celebrated Peter of Corbeil. While there he probably visited\r\nEngland in order to make a pilgrimage to the shrine of Thomas à Becket.\r\nFrom Paris he was sent to Bologna University where he studied civil law\r\nand especially canon law, then a very popular subject. He mastered the\r\nwhole system of decretal lore and made it his guide for the rest of his\r\nlife. In 1181 he returned to Rome, a university graduate, only\r\ntwenty-one years of age, yet celebrated for his theological and legal\r\nerudition.\r\n\r\nEverything pointed him toward a career in the Church--his character, his\r\nbirth as the youngest son of a noble, his family connections with the\r\nChurch, his education, and his natural inclination. It is no surprise,\r\nconsequently, to learn that upon his return to the Eternal City he was\r\nmade a canon of St. Peter's (1181). Gregory VIII. (1187), promoted him\r\nto the office of subdeacon and Clement III. (1190), his maternal uncle,\r\nmade him cardinal-deacon. He now became the chief papal adviser, was a\r\nrecognised leader in the College of Cardinals, though only twenty-nine\r\nyears of age, and was generally known as a second Hildebrand. Upon the\r\nelection of Pope Celestine III. (1191-1198), the leader of a rival\r\nparty, the young churchman deserted practical church work and church\r\npolitics to devote himself to study and literary work. He wrote several\r\nbooks of importance which reveal his deep and extensive culture, his\r\nascetic spirit resembling that of Hildebrand and Luther, his lofty\r\nideals of the Papacy, and his mediæval theology.[546:1]\r\n\r\nCelestine III. died January 8, 1198, urging the cardinals to elect his\r\nnephew John, Cardinal of St. Paul's, as his successor. But the sacred\r\ncollege at once unanimously elected Cardinal Lothario, the youngest of\r\ntheir number, only thirty-seven, as Pope and saluted him as Innocent\r\nIII. His ability and life had marked him out for several years as the\r\nnext occupant of St. Peter's See. Being only in deacon's orders he was\r\nfirst advanced to the priesthood (Feb. 21) then consecrated bishop and\r\ncrowned Pope with an elaborate ceremony of installation (Feb.\r\n22).[547:1]\r\n\r\nInnocent III. came to the papal chair with a belief in man's utter\r\ndepravity and in the Pope's power to pardon all sin and to remit all\r\npenances. After his election, but before coronation, he declared:\r\n\r\n     As God . . . hath set in . . . the heavens two great lights,\r\n     the greater to rule the day, the lesser to rule the night, so\r\n     also hath He set up in His Church . . . two great powers: the\r\n     greater to rule the day, that is the souls; the lesser to rule\r\n     the night, that is the bodies of men. These powers are the\r\n     pontifical and royal: but the moon, as being the lesser body,\r\n     borroweth all her light from the sun both in the quantity and\r\n     quality of the light she sends forth, as also in her position\r\n     and functions in the heavens. . . . The royal power borrows\r\n     all its dignity and splendour from the pontifical.[547:2]\r\n\r\nAgain\r\n\r\n     the Lord hath fashioned His Church after the model of the\r\n     human body placing the Roman Church at the head, thereby\r\n     subjecting, in obedience to himself and her, all churches as\r\n     members of the one body . . . but the Church without the Pope\r\n     were a body without a head.[547:3]\r\n\r\nHis whole policy was summed up in a remarkable consecration sermon from\r\nLuke 12:42:\r\n\r\n     Who is this steward? It is he to whom the Lord Omnipotent\r\n     said, Thou are Peter, etc. This foundation cannot be shaken\r\n     . . . for Christ himself is on board; . . . Christ is the rock\r\n     upon which the Holy See is founded; . . . this chair is not\r\n     established by man but by God alone. . . . Therefore I fear\r\n     not, for I am that steward whom the Lord hath placed over His\r\n     household to give them their meat in due season. . . .\r\n     Therefore my desire is to serve, not to rule. . . . As the\r\n     Lord's steward . . . I must be established in the faith. . . .\r\n     But faith without works is dead. My works, therefore, must be\r\n     wise as well as faithful. . . . The high-priest of the Old\r\n     Testament was the type and pattern of the Pope. . . . I am he\r\n     whom the Lord hath placed over His household; yet who am I\r\n     that I should sit on high above kings and above all princes?\r\n     For of me it is written in the prophets (Jer. 1:10): This\r\n     steward is the viceroy of God, the successor of Peter; he that\r\n     standeth in the midst between God and man. He is the judge of\r\n     all, but is judged by no one . . . Now His Household is the\r\n     whole church and this household is one . . . out of which, if\r\n     anyone remain, he and all his shall surely perish in the\r\n     flood.\r\n\r\nThe germs of these ideas were found in the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals.\r\nThey were formulated by Hildebrand and it now became the passionate\r\npurpose of Innocent III. to realise them in their entirety. To that end\r\nhe adopted Hildebrand's reform program to abolish abuses and corruptions\r\nof all sorts, to enforce celibacy, to subject the clergy to the head of\r\nthe Church, and to make the Church supreme above the state.\r\n\r\nThe situation in Europe at the close of the twelfth century was such as\r\nto aid Innocent in his great plans. The Crusades, now in progress for a\r\ncentury, had aroused a terrific religious enthusiasm, enriched the\r\nChurch, increased the Pope's power, weakened rival secular authority,\r\nand paved the way for the successful realisation of Hildebrand's ideals\r\nby Innocent III. The Papacy was well established. Its dogmas were\r\nexpressed in canon law, its machinery was completed, and its right to\r\nexist as a state resting upon a territorial basis was recognised. In the\r\nEmpire Henry VI. had died in 1197, Naples was ruled by a child, the\r\nGuelphs and Ghibellines were at war in the Lombard cities and the whole\r\nEmpire was distracted and almost reduced to anarchy by the rival\r\nclaimants to the imperial throne. In France Philip Augustus, a\r\ntyrannical ruler, ambitious to overthrow the English king, greedy to\r\nswallow up the larger fiefs, was on the throne. He had divorced his\r\nDanish wife and had remarried. At this time he was violently opposed by\r\nboth the nobles and the people. In Spain the lack of a strong central\r\npower led to quarrelling among the rival kings and compelled the Pope to\r\ninterfere. In England the brutal, boisterous, immoral Richard I. died in\r\n1199 and was succeeded by the tyrannical and feeble King John who was at\r\nwar with his own nobles. In the East the Slavic nations were ready to\r\naccept Roman rule while the Eastern Empire was tottering and ready to\r\nfall. In general parties in all countries were crying out to the Pope\r\nfor assistance. All Europe was ripe for just such a man as Innocent III.\r\nwith just such a policy.\r\n\r\nThe first step in Innocent's plan was to make himself the political head\r\nof Europe. In Italy he first made himself absolute sovereign of Rome by\r\nremoving all vestiges of imperial rule. The senators and the prefect,\r\nwho held their commissions from the Emperor, were required to take oaths\r\nto him as their sovereign.[549:1] The imperial judges were also\r\nreplaced by his own appointees. By persuasion or tactful diplomacy he\r\ngained a mastery over the warring Roman nobles. From Rome he gradually\r\nextended his sway over the rest of Italy. He was made regent of\r\nFrederick II., the youthful son of Henry VI.,[550:1] now King of Sicily.\r\nHe forced the Tuscan cities to recognise his suzerainty[550:2] instead\r\nof that of the German Emperor, and subdued the March of Ancona and the\r\nDuchy of Spoleto.[550:3] He posed as the champion of Italian\r\nindependence and liberty against foreign rule. His leadership was\r\ngenerally recognised and he was called \"The Father of His Country.\"\r\n\"Innocent III. was the first Pope who claimed and exercised the rights\r\nof an Italian Prince.\"[550:4] When Emperor Otto IV. ceded all the lands\r\nclaimed by the Papacy under grants from former rulers, an indisputable\r\ntitle to the papal states was established.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, before the imperial throne was made vacant by the death of\r\nHenry VI. (1197), the princes had been persuaded to choose his infant\r\nson, Frederick, King of the Romans. But the election had been set aside,\r\nand now the imperial crown was claimed by two rival claimants: Otto of\r\nBrunswick and Philip of Hohenstaufen, a brother of Henry VI. The civil\r\nwar which ensued in Germany between these rival claimants gave Innocent\r\nIII. his opportunity. Both claimants appealed to the Pope, but Otto was\r\nthe more submissive. The Pope assumed the function of arbiter and issued\r\na famous bull favouring Otto.[550:5] Otto promised on oath protection\r\nof the possessions and rights of the Roman Church, and obedience and\r\nhomage such as pious Emperors had formerly shown towards the Chair of\r\nPeter (1201). Still victory did not come to Otto and the Pope, until\r\nafter ten years of civil strife followed by the assassination of Philip.\r\nIn 1208 Otto was coronated by Innocent in St. Peter's, Rome, but was\r\nsoon caught in deeds of treachery to the Pope and excommunicated and\r\ndeposed (1210), and died forgotten seven years later.\r\n\r\nFrederick of Sicily was anxious to become King of Germany and also\r\nEmperor. The Hohenstaufen party in Germany invited him to visit them and\r\nin this Frederick was encouraged by Innocent III. Frederick made some\r\nimportant concessions to the Holy See[551:1] (1213), was victorious in\r\nGermany, and was crowned Emperor at Aachen after the Lateran Council in\r\n1215. After a most remarkable career he died, however, a rebel against\r\nthe Church (1250). When death smote down Innocent III., he had created\r\ntwo Emperors, he was recognised as lord paramount over the Empire, and\r\nhe ruled personally over a larger domain in the Empire than any\r\npreceding Pope.\r\n\r\nIn France Philip Augustus had been excommunicated by Pope Celestine III.\r\n(1196) for having divorced his wife, a Danish Princess in order to\r\nmarry, with the sanction of the French clergy, Mary, the daughter of the\r\nDuke of Bohemia. Immediately after his election and before his\r\ncoronation, Innocent III. took up this case. He ordered Philip to put\r\naway his concubine and to take back his lawful wife under the threat of\r\npronouncing his children bastards and of putting his land under an\r\ninterdict. Since the king turned a deaf ear to these demands, the Pope\r\nexcommunicated him, declared France under an interdict,[552:1] and\r\npunished the French bishops. As a result Philip was compelled to submit,\r\nand agreed to take back his wife and to restore confiscated Church\r\nlands. This was a great and significant victory for the Pope.\r\n\r\nIn Spain the King of Leon had married a cousin contrary to canon law.\r\nThe Pope immediately annulled the marriage. The king refused at first to\r\ngive up his wife, but was forced to submission by excommunication.[552:2]\r\nThe Kings of Navarre and Castile were compelled to make peace and to\r\nunite against the Saracens. Portugal was declared a fief of the Holy See\r\nand the king was commanded to hurry up the payment of tribute.[552:3]\r\nThe King of Aragon was crowned by the Pope at Rome as a feudal\r\nvassal.[552:4]\r\n\r\nIn England King John, who had succeeded Richard I. in 1199, had\r\nembittered against him nobles, clergy, and common people by extortions\r\nand tyrannical acts of all sorts. He aroused the wrath of Innocent III.\r\nby making a treaty of peace with Philip Augustus of France, while\r\nthat ruler was still under the ban for repudiating his first wife\r\nand marrying another. John had likewise boldly ousted the Bishop of\r\nLimoges, confiscated his lands, and revived the Constitutions of\r\nClarendon.[552:5] Innocent III. immediately called John to account for\r\nthese misdemeanours[552:6] and forced the stubborn king to promise to\r\nmake a crusade to atone for his sins. The Pope demanded the immediate\r\nreinstatement of the Bishop of Limoges in his office and lands.[553:1]\r\nHe treated the Constitutions of Clarendon as if they had been repealed\r\nand waited for his opportunity to humble the haughty English ruler.\r\n\r\nIn 1205 (July 13), Hubert the Archbishop of Canterbury died. That same\r\nnight the monks of the Cathedral elected their sub-prior as archbishop\r\nand hurried him off to Rome for papal confirmation. King John, backed by\r\nthe suffragan bishops of the diocese, appointed and invested the Bishop\r\nof Norwich as archbishop and he also started for Rome to get the papal\r\nsanction. Here was the opportunity for which Innocent III. was looking.\r\nBoth elections were declared void and the fifteen monks of Canterbury\r\nwere brought to Rome where they were forced to choose Cardinal Stephen\r\nLangton as Archbishop of Canterbury.[553:2] The Pope consecrated Langton\r\nto the new office and demanded King John's approval. John's rage was\r\nunbounded. He impeached the monks for treason and expelled them from\r\nEngland on pain of death. He confiscated the property of the see and the\r\nchapter of Canterbury and told the Pope bluntly that he would never\r\npermit the illegally elected stranger to set foot on English soil. The\r\nPope first threatened the king with an interdict, which merely produced\r\nangry and obstinate counter threats from John, and then in 1208 actually\r\npublished the interdict.[553:3] The king retaliated by seizing Church\r\nproperty, abusing the clergy, exiling the bishops, and confiscating the\r\nestates of their relatives.\r\n\r\nDetermined to humble the stubborn monarch, Innocent III. in 1210\r\nformally excommunicated John and deposed him from the kingship.[554:1]\r\nThe English crown was given to Philip II. of France who at once prepared\r\nan army to invade England. At the same time John's followers deserted\r\nhim and in this desolation he was compelled to accept humiliating terms\r\nof unconditional surrender.[554:2] He agreed to reinstate all prelates\r\nto office and property; to pay a full indemnity to all laity and clergy,\r\neight thousand pounds being paid down as a guarantee; to make the Pope\r\narbiter about all sums of restitution; to give the Pope all right to\r\nChurch patronage in England; to reverse all outlawries; and to surrender\r\nhis crown and kingdoms of England and Ireland to the Pope and then to\r\nreceive them back as the sworn vassal of Rome, paying therefore the\r\nannual sum of one thousand marks of silver.[554:3]\r\n\r\nWhen the English barons wrested from the stubborn king the great Magna\r\nCharta in 1215,[554:4] Pope Innocent III. championed the cause of the\r\nking, his vassal, against the barons. He called a council, annulled the\r\nMagna Charta, issued a manifesto against the barons, and ordered the\r\nbishops to excommunicate them.[554:5] He suspended Archbishop Langton\r\nfrom office for siding with the barons against the king and directly\r\nappointed the Archbishop of York. At the same time Prince Louis\r\nof France, who had invaded England with an army, was summarily\r\nexcommunicated for having entered a domain of the Holy See. As a result\r\nof the Pope's policy King John of England became a suppliant vassal of\r\nRome, the English clergy were subjected to the Pope, the resources of\r\nEngland were put at the Pope's command, the nobles and the people were\r\nthwarted in their efforts to check John in his tyranny, and Magna Charta\r\nwas declared illegal though not invalidated.\r\n\r\nIn the East the Latin rulers in Palestine and at Constantinople were\r\npapal vassals. The Pope asserted his supremacy over the Eastern Empire\r\nin refusing to restore the Isle of Cyprus and in demanding a council to\r\nheal the schism.[555:1] Leo, King of Armenia, threw both his church and\r\nhis kingdom into the Pope's arms for protection.[555:2] Bulgaria was won\r\naway from the Greek Church and her king was given a crown independent of\r\nthe Eastern Empire.[555:3] Hungary was treated as a vassal kingdom and\r\npapal protection was extended to her king.\r\n\r\nIn the North the King of Norway had been slain by a priest who then\r\ncompelled the bishops in 1184 to crown him king. Innocent III. took up\r\nthe case and appointed the King of Denmark and the Archbishop of Norway\r\na court to try the murderer on the charge of having forged papal bulls\r\nto favour his coronation. His supporters were excommunicated, he himself\r\nwas put under the ban, and all places giving him shelter were\r\ninterdicted. Even the Bishop of Ireland was rebuked for having\r\npermitted his clergy to communicate with the \"accursed apostate.\" The\r\nPope reorganised the northern churches and tied the clergy to St.\r\nPeter's Chair. In Poland the archbishop was censured for neglecting to\r\ndraw the spiritual sword in favour of Duke Bolesas who had been ill\r\ntreated by his subjects. The Duke of Holland, a faithful vassal, was in\r\nturn assisted against his rebellious subjects.\r\n\r\nNo occupant of St. Peter's Chair was more sincerely impressed with the\r\nbeauty and necessity of rescuing the Holy Land from the infidels than\r\nInnocent III. He sent preachers all over Europe to stir up a holy war.\r\nHe laboured incessantly to pacify and unite all rulers under his\r\nguidance in this great enterprise. He attempted to eliminate the\r\nmercenary character of the crusade by forbidding the Venetians to\r\ntraffic with the Mohammedans.[556:1] But he strove in vain to prevent\r\nthe secular diversions and consequent failure of the Fourth Crusade.\r\nWhen the crusaders in fulfilment of their bargain with the\r\nVenetians,[556:2] left Venice to attack Zara, a Christian city, he\r\nthreatened them with excommunication. After the deed was done, however,\r\nhe granted conditional pardon.[556:3] The capture of Constantinople was\r\nlikewise censured but in the end lauded,[556:4] although he strongly\r\nurged the crusaders to fulfil their original vow.[556:5] So skillfully\r\ndid he manipulate affairs that both Greek and Latin Emperors recognised\r\nhis overlordship, the Greek Church was subjected to Rome, and the\r\nappointment of the Patriarch of Constantinople was in his hands.\r\n\r\nSince this phase of the fourth crusade fell so far short of its original\r\naim, Innocent summoned the Lateran Council in 1215 to proclaim an ideal\r\ncrusade for June 1, 1216.[557:1] The Pope intended to direct the\r\nmovement in person or by legates. The usual privileges were granted to\r\ncrusaders and a variety of financial regulations were published\r\nauthorising the clergy to sell or mortgage Church lands for three years\r\nin order to raise necessary funds; urging kings, nobles, cities, and\r\nrural districts to contribute money and men, and levying a tax on the\r\ncardinals and the head of the Church. In addition the Pope contributed\r\nout of his private possessions thirty-three thousand pounds of silver\r\nand a large ship. A truce for four years was enjoined on all Christian\r\nprinces on pain of excommunication and interdict. Through the untimely\r\ndeath of the Pope, however, while he was going to persuade Pisa to join\r\nin the crusade, the crusade did not mature, but later the Popes were not\r\nslow in claiming the leadership granted in this instance by the council\r\nto Innocent III.\r\n\r\nIn no direction did Innocent III. accomplish more than in his\r\nuncompromising attack on heresy. It must never be forgotten that heresy\r\nwas the greatest crime of the Middle Ages. God had planted His Church on\r\nearth, appointed the Pope as vice-gerent, and prescribed laws and dogmas\r\nin the Bible and the canons to govern the Church. Any violation of these\r\nlaws, or disbelief in the dogmas, was heresy. Consequently, heresy was\r\ntreason against both the Church and God. A heretic was like a man with\r\na dangerous, infectious disease. Not only was he himself in mortal\r\ndanger, but he might inoculate the whole community and carry it too,\r\ndown to perdition. It was the duty of the Church, therefore, to get rid\r\nof that diseased person either by curing him through recantation, or\r\nending his power for evil by death.\r\n\r\nThe existence of heresy parallels the whole history of the Church and\r\nsuggests a universal mental attribute. The causes for the remarkable\r\ngrowth of heresy are to be found in the departure of the Church from its\r\nearlier teachings and practices, in the failure of the Church to make\r\nits theory and practice harmonise,[558:1] in the remnants of earlier\r\ndoctrines and heresies, and in the mental awakening of the twelfth and\r\nthirteenth centuries[558:2] due to the crusades and other\r\ninfluences.[558:3] Among the leading heretics of this period were:\r\n\r\n1. Tanchelm, who carried on a heretical movement in Flanders\r\n(1108-1126), teaching the historical origin of the hierarchy, the\r\npollution of the Eucharist in the hands of a bad priest, the illegality\r\nof tithes and the congregational view of church government.[558:4]\r\n\r\n2. Eon de l'Etoile in Brittany who declared that he was the son of God\r\nsent to reform the Church (1145-1148).[558:5]\r\n\r\n3. Pierre de Bruys who preached in Vallonise until he was burned\r\n(1106-1126), declaring infant baptism useless, offerings, prayers, and\r\nmasses for the dead of no avail since each one would be judged by his\r\nown merits, churches unnecessary, the use of the cross idolatry, the\r\nEucharist a mere historical incident and the Papacy with its hierarchy\r\nof officials a blatant fraud.[559:1]\r\n\r\n4. Henry of Lausanne who deserted his monastery and became a reformer in\r\nvarious districts in France (1116-1147). He rejected the invocation of\r\nsaints, taught asceticism, denounced the vice of the clergy, discarded\r\nthe Eucharist, denied the sanctity of the priesthood, declared tithes to\r\nbe illegal, opposed attendance at Church, and aroused an intense zeal\r\nfor purity and piety. Whole congregations left their churches and joined\r\nhim. At last the Church secured his arrest and condemnation to\r\nimprisonment for life, but he appears to have died shortly after.[559:2]\r\n\r\n5. Arnold of Brescia, a pupil of Abelard, who travelled in various parts\r\nof Italy, France, and Germany, denouncing infant baptism, rejecting the\r\nEucharist, assailing the wealth of the Church, lashing the vices of the\r\nclergy, and organising associations of \"Poor Men\" until he was finally\r\nhanged, then burnt, and his ashes thrown into the Tiber.[559:3]\r\n\r\n6. Peter Waldo of Lyons, a rich but ignorant merchant, who from a study\r\nof the New Testament was led, after providing for his family, to give\r\nall his possessions to the poor.[559:4] He became an ardent preacher,\r\nwon converts, and sent them out as proselyting missionaries. He and his\r\nfollowers refused obedience to Pope and prelates saying all good men\r\nwere priests, permitted women to preach, declared God and not man should\r\nbe obeyed, rejected masses and prayers for the dead as useless, denied\r\npurgatory, assailed indulgences, advocated non-resistance, denounced war\r\nand homicide, attacked all the vices of the day, and organised \"The Poor\r\nMen of Lyons\" which order soon spread under the name Waldenses all over\r\nEurope.[560:1]\r\n\r\n7. The Catharists who appeared during the Middle Ages in Lombardy in the\r\neleventh century and soon spread over western Europe and became very\r\npowerful. They were dualists believing in God and Satan, the spiritual\r\nand the physical, the good and the bad. They held that Christ came to\r\noverthrow Satan and that the Roman Church was the latter's seat. They\r\nrejected the authority and doctrines of the Church and had a distinct\r\nritual of their own. Soon they broke up into different sects with\r\ndifferent names and were known in southern France as Albigenses.[560:2]\r\n\r\nInnocent III.'s theory of the Papacy clearly indicated his duty about\r\nheresy and the co-operation which he might demand of the secular\r\npowers.[560:3] In the first year of his pontificate (1198) heretics were\r\noffered the choice of recantation or death.[560:4] The clergy were\r\nlikewise ordered to mend their ways in order to remove the cause of\r\nheresy.[560:5] Two Inquisitors-General were sent to Spain and France\r\nwhere the clergy were directed to give them information about heresy,\r\nand the rulers and laity were asked to help the \"Persecution.\"[560:6] As\r\na result a number of heretics were put to death in Spain, southern\r\nFrance, and Italy. The following year (1199) the Pope appointed an\r\nadditional Inquisitor-General for Italy and added a third for France\r\nand Spain. They were all kept very busy.\r\n\r\nIn 1207 Innocent in person led a force against the heretics at Viterbo\r\nin Italy. The heretics fled but their houses were torn down, their\r\nproperty confiscated, and a search made for suspects. An edict was also\r\npassed decreeing that heretics should be treated as outcasts, that they\r\nshould be seized and given up to secular rulers, that their property\r\nshould be confiscated, that their hiding places should be razed to the\r\nground, that their protectors or sympathisers should forfeit one fourth\r\nof their property and be outlawed, and that rulers refusing to execute\r\nthe decree should be excommunicated.[561:1] The same year a similar\r\nedict was issued against the heretics in southern France. To all who\r\nexecuted the decree were offered indulgences like those given devout\r\nvisitors to the shrines of the Apostles Peter and James. On the other\r\nhand those who aided heretics were to suffer the same punishment.[561:2]\r\n\r\nInnocent appointed a fourth Inquisitor-General and sent him to the\r\nFrench King to urge him to help exterminate the heretics. The powers of\r\nthe Inquisitors at the same time were enlarged. The Pope now decreed a\r\ngeneral war against \"the enemies of God and man.\" The King of France was\r\ncalled upon to draw the sword, while the nobles and people were summoned\r\nto the new crusade with promises of the same indulgences as given to\r\nthose who went as soldiers to Palestine.[561:3] Count Raymond of\r\nToulouse was harshly excommunicated and deposed. This new holy war with\r\nSimon de Montfort as leader, was preached amidst much enthusiasm. A\r\nbloody war of extermination was carried on for some years in southern\r\nFrance until the Albigenses were all but extinct. As a result, the\r\nPope's authority was greatly increased, Simon de Montfort was made Count\r\nof Toulouse, while Raymond was exiled to England, the precedent for\r\nusing the crusading machinery against heretical regions was established,\r\nand the Inquisition was founded. The Lateran Council in 1215 defined\r\nheresy and formulated complete regulations for its suppression.[562:1]\r\n\r\nNot only was Innocent III. a great defender of Church dogmas, a\r\nmaster-organiser of the hierarchy, and an administrator without a peer\r\nin Church history, but he was also a far-reaching and sincerely\r\nintelligent reformer. The judicial reforms were necessary to round out\r\nInnocent's theory of Church government. He claimed immediate, personal\r\njurisdiction over all \"_causæ majores_,\" such as disputes of the clergy,\r\nand all questions involving the interests of the Church or of churchmen.\r\nConsequently, the power of secular rulers over the clergy was curtailed.\r\nAn appalling number of cases was sent for settlement to the curia at\r\nRome and cases there were decided with a speed and punctuality hitherto\r\nunknown. Innocent III. personally \"held court\" three days each week,\r\nheard all important cases and rendered the decisions.[562:2] On the\r\nother hand unimportant cases were turned over to committees under his\r\neye. He insisted upon having honest judges all over Christendom for\r\nminor cases and enforced his will by making an appeal to Rome simple,\r\neasy, and inexpensive.[562:3] All bribes and gifts to judges were\r\nstrictly prohibited. The Lateran Council of 1215 modified the trial of\r\nclerical offenders by insisting upon trial in the presence of the\r\naccused, a clear statement of the charges, a list of witnesses for the\r\naccused, and no appeal before the rendering of a decision in an inferior\r\ncourt.[563:1] Innocent III. also took all treaties between nations under\r\nthe protection of the Church,[563:2] and insisted on acting as supreme\r\narbiter in all wars and civil feuds.[563:3]\r\n\r\nThe necessity of moral reformation was recognised by Innocent III. from\r\nthe beginning of his pontificate. From the year of his election he\r\nendeavoured to abolish all those debilitating corruptions which\r\nprevented the realisation of his ideal priesthood; namely, pluralism,\r\nluxury, rapacity, pride, arrogance, and other evils. The clergy were\r\nemphatically commanded to free themselves of these abuses and severe\r\norders were given to his legates to root out these evils.[563:4] In 1215\r\nthe Lateran Council was called for the \"extirpation of vices, the\r\nplanting of virtues, the correction of abuses, and the reformation of\r\nmorals.\" All the clergy were urged to note the evils needing amendment\r\nand to correct the same.[563:5] In a sermon opening this remarkably\r\nrepresentative council the Pope urged the clergy to reform themselves so\r\nthat they could the better lead their flocks aright.[563:6] Many\r\nreformatory measures were enacted by this Council. Nepotism was\r\nprohibited, monastic abuses were corrected; pluralities were forbidden;\r\nthe extravagant use of relics was curtailed; the extortions and simony\r\nof the clergy were abolished and renewed stress was laid on the canons\r\nof celibacy.[564:1]\r\n\r\nThe doctrinal changes instituted by Innocent III. were likewise\r\nimportant. The dogma of transubstantiation was canonised by the Lateran\r\nCouncil in 1215. Before that time there had been many and divergent\r\nviews concerning this important subject. The leading motive which\r\nactuated Innocent in having this doctrine carefully defined was to\r\ndestroy heresy. In consequence of the new dogma the sacerdotal body was\r\nelevated by being given a holier character while each individual priest\r\nemployed this new power as a badge of divine dignity. All discussion\r\nabout transubstantiation now ceased. Heresy was more clearly defined\r\nthan ever and the Inquisition was canonised. At the same time the unity\r\nof the Church on its doctrinal side was given greater emphasis. The\r\ncanonical restrictions on marriage were relaxed. The earlier rigid law\r\nhad led to grave abuses, since the clergy annulled marriages and\r\nbastardised the offspring while the laity made it an excuse for divorce\r\nand licentious passion. The prohibition of marriage between the relative\r\nof a second wife and a first was removed. The degree of consanguinity\r\nand affinity was reduced from the seventh to the fourth canonical\r\ndegree. Secret marriages were prohibited. The publication of the bans\r\nwas made necessary. Confession and penitential satisfaction were\r\nprescribed as obligatory at least once a year under the penalty of\r\nexcommunication. Physicians were likewise required to send all the sick\r\nto the priest first to have their souls cured before any effort was\r\nmade to heal the body. The penalty for disobedience was exclusion from\r\nthe communion.\r\n\r\nThe administrative reforms of Innocent III. embraced a wide range of\r\nmeasures. Honorary precedence was granted to the Patriarch of\r\nConstantinople. Elections to vacancies in the Church were reduced to\r\nthree forms: (1) A committee of three of the electors was to take the\r\nvotes and to declare who had received \"the greater and sounder\" number;\r\n(2) a committee was to be empowered to appoint for the whole body of\r\nelectors; (3) a choice was to be made by acclamation. All lay\r\ninterference was excluded, otherwise the election would be _ipso facto_\r\nillegal. Papal confirmation and the right of revision were carefully\r\nguarded. Pluralities were strictly prohibited. Tithes were given\r\nprecedence over all other taxes and dues, and the clergy were urged to\r\nguard the property and to collect all monies of the Church.[565:1] The\r\nright to transfer ecclesiastics was reserved to the Pope alone.[565:2]\r\nFinally the Inquisition was instituted for the purpose of suppressing\r\nheresy, of enforcing doctrines and ordinances, and of reforming the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nInnocent III. as head of the great Church easily outranked every ruler\r\nof his day and stands high among the greatest leaders of the Middle Ages\r\nand of all ages. A contemporary describes him as \"A man of wonderful\r\nfortitude and wisdom--one who had no equal in his own day; whereby he\r\nhad been able to do acts of miraculous power and greatness.\" If\r\nHildebrand was the Julius, Innocent was the Augustus of the Papal\r\nEmpire. He seldom miscalculated--his clear intellect never missed an\r\nopportunity--his calculating spirit rarely erred--and he combined\r\nforbearance with vigour. \"Order, method, unswerving resolution,\r\ninexorable determination, undaunted self-assertion, patience, vigilance,\r\nand cunning, all co-operating to the accomplishment of a single\r\nwell-defined object--and that object the unlimited extension of the\r\npolitical power of the Pontiff of Rome--had achieved a signal triumph\r\nover the irregular, the selfish, and the impulsive political opposition\r\nof the secular powers.\"[566:1]\r\n\r\nThe moral character of his reign was variously viewed by contemporaries.\r\nThe English clergy generally disliked him and a writer of the day\r\nasserted that his death, July 26, 1216, caused more joy than sorrow. St.\r\nLuitgarde, the prioress of a Cistercian Convent in Brabant, said that in\r\na vision she had seen him in purgatory enveloped in flames for his\r\nsins.[566:2] The crimes of ambition, cruelty, deceit and treachery were\r\ncharged against him as a shrewd political intriguer. The practical\r\ncharity and genuine humility of an earlier day--when he washed and\r\nkissed the feet of twelve poor men taken from the street every\r\nSaturday[566:3]--seemed to disappear in the multiplied duties of a world\r\nruler. His piety, honesty of purpose, and sincere conviction of his\r\ngreat mission cannot be questioned. Yet for some reason the Church, for\r\nwhich he did so much, has never seen fit to canonise this great Pope.\r\n\r\nNo other wearer of the papal tiara has left behind him so many results\r\npregnant with good and ill for the future of the Church. Under him the\r\nPapacy reached the culmination of its secular power and prerogatives.\r\nThe principles of sacerdotal government were fully and intelligently\r\nelaborated. The code of ecclesiastical law was completed and enforced.\r\nAll the Christian princes of Europe were brought to recognise the\r\noverlordship of the successor of St. Peter. All the clergy obeyed his\r\nwill as the one supreme law. Heresy was washed out in blood. The\r\nPseudo-Isidorian Decretals and the dreams of Hildebrand had been\r\nrealised. Yet in this very greatness, wealth, and strength, were the\r\ngerms of weakness and disease which were eventually to overthrow the\r\ngreat structure reared by Innocent III. and his predecessors.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES.\r\n\r\nA.--PRIMARY:\r\n\r\n     1.--Colby, C.

IX.--Sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thirteenth century was an age \"of lofty aspirations unfulfilled,\r\nof brilliant dreams unsubstantial as visions, of hopes ever looking\r\nto fruition and ever disappointed. The human intellect awakened,\r\nbut as yet the human conscience slumbered, save in a few rare souls\r\nwho mostly paid in disgrace or death the penalty of their precocious\r\nsensitiveness.\"[569:1] The thirteenth century left as a legacy to the\r\nfourteenth century vast activity in intellectual progress, but a\r\nspiritual desert. Society was harder, coarser, and more worldly than\r\never.\r\n\r\nEverywhere in western Europe the Church seemed to have attained the\r\nextreme limits of its claims. The papal theory was triumphant. Temporal\r\nrulers were everywhere subservient to the ecclesiastics. Locally the\r\nclergy ruled the masses in morals and religion; they controlled\r\neducation and intelligence; and they practically settled all social and\r\nindustrial questions. At the same time the spirit of asceticism was\r\nnever more pronounced than in the early Cistercians, Carthusians,\r\nDominicans, Franciscans, and other orders. Mysticism stood like a\r\nstone wall to stem the tide of worldliness, of wickedness, and of\r\ndisbelief.[570:1] When St. Bernard preached to the students at Paris on\r\nthe vanity of study and induced twenty of them to follow him into\r\nthe cloister at Clairvaux he was attempting a very significant\r\nsocial revolution which culminated in St. Dominic and St. Francis.\r\nNevertheless, in the very face of the ascendancy of the Roman hierarchy\r\nand notwithstanding the spiritual revival within the Church, there\r\nappeared a vast amount of heresy, of irreverence, and of independence.\r\nThe spirit of individuality was abroad. Men became less obedient to\r\nauthority and began to doubt the truth of what was taught them. This\r\nwide-spread distrust led to a shifting from one authority to another,\r\nrather than an entire rejection of all authority.[570:2]\r\n\r\nThe wealth and power of the clergy and nobility had decreased; the\r\nburghers had advanced to a position of influence and self-consciousness.\r\nGuilds, the awakened spirit of nationality, and self-governing communes\r\nwere democratic factors to be taken into account. The rise of the lower\r\nclasses, and the consequent decline of the upper classes, show that a\r\nnew era is dawning over Europe. The bourgeois literature reveals a\r\nmocking contempt for nobles and bishops alike. There was a great deal of\r\nflippant wit which spared no topic and no individual. \"God and the\r\ndevil, Aristotle and the Pope, canon and feudal law, Cistercians and\r\npriests were held up to ridicule.\"[571:1] The subjects of popular songs\r\nare no longer exclusively the virtues of asceticism and humility,\r\nobedience to God and the feudal lord; but love of woman and the carnal\r\njoys of life have become popular themes. Villains achieve paradise by\r\ntrickery. Men continually outwit Satan. A famous jongleur even shakes\r\ndice with St. Peter, and beats him at the game. Verily a new chapter was\r\nopening in the history of Europe.\r\n\r\nSevere criticism of the iniquity and depravity of the clergy, their\r\ngreed for wealth and position, and particularly their contempt for their\r\nsacred obligations, came from several sources.\r\n\r\n(1) The best men in the Church, among whom are Popes, bishops, abbots,\r\npriests, and monks. Their letters and sermons reveal flagrant abuses and\r\nan earnest cry for reform.\r\n\r\n(2) The acts of Church councils and synods show the general recognition\r\namong the clergy of the presence of grave irregularities and evils, and\r\nalso a consciousness of their destructive tendencies.\r\n\r\n(3) The general impression of selfishness and wickedness, which the\r\nChurch officials made, soon was reflected in the satirical poems of the\r\npopular troubadours and by the sprightly versifiers of the\r\ncourts.[571:2]\r\n\r\n(4) The laity of course were not slow to understand conditions and\r\nbecame scathing critics. These lay censors in many instances went far\r\nbeyond the clerical reformers. While the better clergy urged the\r\nelimination of current abuses not one of them dreamed of denying the\r\nfundamental doctrines of the Church or the efficacy of its ceremonies.\r\nOn the contrary, the lay leaders became very extreme. They declared that\r\nthe Church was the creation and home of the devil; that no one ought to\r\nbelieve any longer that salvation came only through sacerdotal\r\nministrations; that all theatrical ceremonies were of no avail; that the\r\nmasses, relics, holy water, and indulgences were mere priestly tricks\r\nfor money-making purposes and not certain means of gaining paradise.\r\nThese extreme opponents of the Church soon gained followers all over\r\nChristendom, from all social classes and on account of a great many\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of ecclesiastical law, however, these drastic\r\ncritics who questioned the teachings of the Church, and proposed to\r\nrepudiate it, were guilty of the grave crime of heresy. The attempt to\r\ncrush the wide-spread heresies of the thirteenth century forms an awful\r\nchapter in the history of the mediæval Church. The rise of the\r\nAlbigenses, the Waldenses, and other heretical sects forced the Church\r\nto take drastic measures against these dangerous foes. Before the close\r\nof the twelfth century secular rulers were induced to take measures\r\nagainst heresy. In England Henry II. in 1166 ordered that no one should\r\nharbour heretics, and that any house in which they were received should\r\nbe burned. In Spain the King of Aragon in 1194 decreed that any one who\r\nshould listen to the Waldensians, or even give them food, should have\r\nhis property confiscated and suffer death. These measures began a series\r\nof merciless decrees which even the most enlightened rulers of the\r\nthirteenth century passed against heretics and their abettors.[573:1]\r\n\r\nThe Church was not slow to utilise this power. A determination to\r\nextirpate these dangerous heretics with the sword produced the crusade\r\nagainst the Albigensians. The Inquisition was also organised to ferret\r\nout secret heretics and to bring them before inquisitorial tribunals for\r\npunishment. The unfairness of the trials and the heartless treatment of\r\nsuspects have rendered the name of the Inquisition infamous.[573:2]\r\n\r\nFrom an early day the Church exercised a censorship over all\r\nbooks.[573:3] The first specific instance was that of a synod of bishops\r\nin Asia Minor about 150 A.D. which prohibited the _Acta pauli_. After\r\nthat the condemnation of books was not at all uncommon.[573:4] The first\r\npapal Index was issued in 494 by Pope Gelasius I., who made a definite\r\ncatalogue of works prohibited. Councils condemned books as heretical,\r\nwhile Popes prohibited their use, destroyed them, and punished those who\r\nviolated the law. This policy was continued throughout the Middle Ages.\r\nNaturally the Church was just as desirous of getting rid of heretical\r\nbooks as of suppressing the obnoxious authors.[573:5]\r\n\r\nIn territorial extent the Roman Church of the thirteenth century\r\nincluded Italy and Sicily, Spain except the southern part, France,\r\nGermany, Hungary, Poland, England, Ireland, and Scotland, Scandinavia\r\nand Iceland, the Eastern Empire, though but temporarily, and Palestine\r\nfor a short period. In size, therefore, it surpassed the old Roman\r\nEmpire at its greatest height. The boundary lines of this great papal\r\nEmpire were widened still further by the zealous missionary work\r\nencouraged by the Supreme Pontiff in Europe among the Slavs, Prussians,\r\nFinns, and Mohammedans in Sicily and Spain; in Asia among the Tartars,\r\nMongols, and Moslems; in Africa among the Mohammedans[574:1]; in America\r\namong the inhabitants of Iceland, Greenland, and \"Vineland\"--possibly\r\neven on the New England coast. These fruitful labours were conducted\r\nchiefly by the Franciscans and the Dominicans.\r\n\r\nThe wealth of the Church at this time consisted of lands and buildings;\r\nChurch furniture, utensils, and ornaments; and money derived from Church\r\nlands, the sale of privileges, the gifts of the pious, tithes, and the\r\nfees for various kinds of religious service. In the United States\r\nchurches must rely wholly upon voluntary support. It was not so with the\r\nmediæval Church. The tithes were regular taxes and those persons upon\r\nwhom they were levied had to pay them just as taxes imposed by\r\ngovernments must be paid to-day. Wide-spread complaint came from both\r\nclergy and laity that these taxes were unjust. The Church actually owned\r\nabout one third of Germany, nearly one fifth of France, the greater part\r\nof Italy, a large section of Christian Spain, a big portion of England,\r\nperhaps one third, and important regions in Scandinavia, Poland, and\r\nHungary. The papal states in Italy, running diagonally across the\r\npeninsula, were ruled by the Pope as a temporal prince. These extensive\r\nterritorial possessions together with the great wealth made the Church\r\nthe mightiest secular power in the world and put into the hands of the\r\nChurch thousands of lucrative sinecures, coveted and too often secured\r\nby persons wholly unfitted for the spiritual functions of the office.\r\nThrough these extensive possessions the Church was beyond all question\r\nthe greatest economic and industrial power in Europe. The Church was led\r\nto adopt feudalism and thus the Pope became the most powerful feudal\r\noverlord in Europe. Furthermore, the Church, because of its vast domains\r\nand enormous income, was enabled to support itself by its own perpetual\r\nwealth. In consequence many evils and abuses sprang up,[575:1] or were\r\nintroduced, which led to the decline of the Church and the numerous\r\ndemands for reformation. It must be said, however, to the credit of the\r\nChurch that these resources were used to excellent advantage in\r\nfurthering charity of all sorts and in caring for the poor and\r\nunfortunate.\r\n\r\nDuring this period the organisation of the papal hierarchy was\r\nperfected. At the head stood the all-powerful and absolute Pope as God's\r\nagent on earth; hence, at least in theory and claim, he was the ruler of\r\nthe whole world in temporal and spiritual affairs. He was the defender\r\nof Christianity, the Church, and the clergy in all respects. He was the\r\nsupreme censor of morals in Christendom and the head of a great\r\nspiritual despotism. He was the source of all earthly justice and the\r\nfinal court of appeal in all cases. Any person, whether priest or\r\nlayman, could appeal to him at any stage in the trial of a great many\r\nimportant cases. He was the supreme lawgiver on earth, hence he called\r\nall councils and confirmed or rejected their decrees. He might, if he\r\nso wished, set aside any law of the Church, no matter how ancient, so\r\nlong as it was not directly ordained by the Bible or by nature. He could\r\nalso make exceptions to purely human laws and these exceptions were\r\nknown as dispensations.[576:1] He had the sole authority to transfer\r\nor depose bishops and other Church officers. He was the creator of\r\ncardinals and ecclesiastical honours of all kinds. He was the exclusive\r\npossessor of the universal right of absolution, dispensation, and\r\ncanonisation. He was the grantor of all Church benefices. He was the\r\nsuperintendent of the whole financial system of the Church and of all\r\ntaxes. He had control over the whole force of the clergy in Christendom,\r\nbecause he conferred the _pallium_,[576:2] the archbishop's badge of\r\noffice. In his hands were kept the terrible thunders of the Church to\r\nenforce obedience to papal law, namely, excommunication and the\r\ninterdict.\r\n\r\nExcommunication meant for a private person that he was a social outcast,\r\nexcluded from all legal protection and deprived of the sacraments which\r\nwere \"the life blood of the man of the Middle Ages.\" His property might\r\nbe confiscated without the possibility of recovery. Death and hell were\r\nsure to be his doom if repentance and absolution did not occur. And\r\nthese same terrible results might even be extended to his descendants.\r\nExcommunication for a king meant, in addition to the same treatment as a\r\nprivate individual, the deprivation of all authority and the absolution\r\nof subjects from all obedience. Excommunication was the greatest moral\r\npower in all history and effective simply because the Christian opinion\r\nof the age responded to it and enforced it. By its use the Pope\r\nsubjected to his will such powerful personages as Henry IV. of Germany,\r\nHenry II. of England, Philip (IV.) Augustus of France, Frederick II. of\r\nGermany, John of England, and countless lesser persons all over\r\nChristendom.[577:1] The power of excommunication was exercised by\r\nthe Pope for the whole Church, by the bishop for his diocese, and\r\neven by subordinate Church officials. The formula and ceremony for\r\nexcommunication were not uniform either in time or place but varied\r\ngreatly.[577:2]\r\n\r\nThe interdict was directed against a city, a region, or a kingdom. It\r\nwas used for the purpose of forcing a city or a ruler to obedience, as\r\nfor example the interdict laid on Rome in 1155, and that on England,\r\nwhich lasted six years three months and fourteen days, to subdue the\r\nobstinate King John; or to enforce the ban of excommunication[577:3]; or\r\nto collect debts[577:4]; or to wreak vengeance for the death or\r\nmaltreatment of a son of the Church.[577:5] The interdict was proclaimed\r\nin a papal bull and read by the clergy of the region affected to the\r\ncongregations every Sunday for some weeks before it went into operation.\r\nThen all religious rites and sacraments ceased except baptism,\r\nconfession, and the viaticum.[577:6] All the faithful were ordered to\r\ndress like penitents and to pray for the removal of the cause of the\r\ncurse. Thus the interdict resembled a raging pestilence and made a deep\r\nimpression on the ignorant masses. It practically stopped all civil\r\ngovernment, for the courts of justice were closed, wills could not be\r\nmade, and public officials of all kinds were forbidden to act. Naturally\r\nit led to many very superstitious tales. For instance, the valley of\r\nAspe in Béarn was cursed for seven years and during that time it was\r\nsaid that women bore no children, cattle gave no increase, and the land\r\nproduced no crops or fruit.[578:1]\r\n\r\nThe use of such powerful weapons as excommunication and interdict was\r\nsoon greatly abused. Popes and bishops employed this power out of spite,\r\nor hatred or for ambitious ends.[578:2] Scheming rulers enlisted papal,\r\nor episcopal, help of this sort to humble political rivals and\r\nfor purely secular ends such as enforcing laws and collecting\r\nobligations.[578:3] In fact so wide-spread was the employment of these\r\npowers that by the fourteenth century half of the Christians in Europe\r\nwere under the ban.[578:4] It was taught, moreover, that however illicit\r\nor apparently unfair or unwarranted, still the ecclesiastical mandates\r\nwere to be obeyed. Hence Popes even granted the right not to be\r\nexcommunicated without good cause.[578:5] Before long these religious\r\ncurses degenerated to the point where they were applied to animals and\r\ninanimate objects, of which there are many illustrations. For instance\r\ntwo of St. Bernard's monks cursed the vineyard of a rival monk and it\r\nbecame sterile until St. Bernard himself removed the blight.[579:1] A\r\ncertain priest, noticing that the fruit of a neighbouring orchard had a\r\nstronger attraction for the children of his congregation than the divine\r\nservice, excommunicated the orchard, whereupon it remained barren until\r\nthe ban was taken off.[579:2] At the request of the farmers, the Bishop\r\nof Comminges cursed the weeds in their fields with the desired\r\nresult.[579:3] St. Bernard, however, capped the climax of these\r\nabsurdities when he solemnly excommunicated the devil.[579:4] After the\r\nthirteenth century the same weapons were used against leeches, rats,\r\ngrasshoppers, snails, bugs, and pests of all kinds. In fact as late as\r\n1648 a similar formula was given based on the forty-ninth psalm and the\r\neleventh chapter of Luke.[579:5]\r\n\r\nThe efficacy of excommunication was likewise brought into service to\r\nprotect property. For instance the Archbishop of Campostella in the\r\ntwelfth century excommunicated any one who should steal or mutilate the\r\nmanuscript history of his diocese. The Abbot of Sens in 1123 cursed on\r\nhis death-bed any successor who should sell, lend, or lose any of the\r\ntwenty volumes in the abbey library. Clement III. encouraged Bologna\r\nUniversity by anathematising any person who should offer a higher rent\r\nfor rooms used by students or teachers. Later, copyrights were protected\r\nby the same power and stolen property was recovered.[579:6] Letters\r\nbestowing the power of excommunication were soon purchased and used for\r\nall sorts of mercenary purposes.[579:7] John Gerson of the University\r\nof Paris denounced Pope Martin V. for saying that as Pope he\r\ncongratulated himself because he was no longer in danger of\r\nexcommunication.[580:1] Gradually there came to be drawn up a list of no\r\nless than one hundred sins which were _ipso facto_ followed by\r\nexcommunication. Many of these are of the most trifling character, like\r\nthat of collecting toll from a priest on crossing a bridge.[580:2] But\r\nthis evil was offset by the ease with which one could purchase\r\nabsolution.\r\n\r\nThe papal court, or curia, by the thirteenth century included an\r\nenormous number of persons both secular and ecclesiastic with all kinds\r\nof duties. The financial section was in many ways the most important\r\none.[580:3] All members of the curia, which resembled the court of an\r\nEmperor, were directly responsible to the Pope. The cardinals were the\r\nmost dignified and powerful members. Papal legates from the court\r\nswarmed over all Europe commissioned with unlimited authority to execute\r\npapal commands and to uphold papal claims. They ranged from primates to\r\npetty priests and monks, were directly subject to the Pope, and were\r\nfeared and hated by the clergy and laity alike.\r\n\r\nThe College of Cardinals created in 1059 had come to play a marked rôle\r\nin ecclesiastical affairs in addition to their original duties. Their\r\noffice ranked next to that of the Pope and they were called the \"Holy\r\nand Sacred College.\" Foreigners were first appointed as cardinals in the\r\nthirteenth century. A distinct dress was assumed. The red hat was given\r\nby Innocent IV. (1245); the purple robe was bestowed by Boniface VIII.\r\n(1297); the white horse, red cover, and golden bridle were added by Paul\r\nII. (1464); and the title of \"Eminence\" was created by Urban VIII.\r\n(1630). These cardinals were shrewd politicians for the most part and\r\nhence divided into French, German, and Italian parties. They secured\r\ntheir appointments ofttimes through favouritism or nepotism, hence were\r\nnot always men of the most sterling worth. As members of the papal court\r\nthey lived at Rome and were supposed to be occupied with ecclesiastical\r\naffairs in the capital or busy on important diplomatic missions. They\r\nwere easily won away, however, from their lofty duties by secular\r\nprinces and became involved in all sorts of questionable intrigues. It\r\nis not a matter of surprise, therefore, to find the best men of the day\r\nlike Dante and Petrarch denouncing them in unmeasured terms.\r\n\r\nBelow the cardinals in the hierarchy came the metropolitans,\r\narchbishops, and primates. The archbishops were the most numerous but\r\nthe lowest in rank. The metropolitans ranked next and were found in the\r\ngreat cities. The primates had the highest rank but were comparatively\r\nfew. It is doubtful whether altogether the archbishops in the thirteenth\r\ncentury numbered more than twenty-five. The primates, who had charge in\r\na general way of what might be called the national churches, confirmed\r\nthe election of bishops and archbishops in their dioceses, called and\r\npresided over national synods, held the superior ecclesiastical courts,\r\nperformed the coronation ceremonies of kings and queens, and had general\r\ncontrol of their districts. The archbishops ruled over a distinct\r\nprovince including several bishops, whose election and consecration they\r\nsuperintended, called and presided over provincial synods, inflicted\r\ncensures and punishments on the bishops for breaches of discipline,\r\nacted as court of appeal above the episcopal courts, and exercised\r\ngeneral oversight concerning all Church affairs of the districts. The\r\nmetropolitans, whose historical significance was practically lost by the\r\nthirteenth century, had essentially the same office as that of\r\narchbishop. Under the leadership of the higher ecclesiastics there was a\r\ntendency to form national churches. The primates and archbishops\r\ndefended these national churches even against the Pope and frequently\r\nsided with the kings against the supreme Pontiffs. In Germany they\r\nhelped elect the Emperor, played an important political rôle, and saved\r\nGermany from ruin again and again.[582:1] In France and England they\r\nwere the trusted counsellors and advisers of the sovereign. Almost\r\nwithout exception they came from the nobility and were large landed\r\nproprietors as well as secular rulers.\r\n\r\nThe bishops, who came next in the scale of the hierarchy, were elected\r\noriginally by the people and the clergy but that right was gradually\r\nusurped by the metropolitans and the secular rulers. The mitre and\r\ncrosier were the emblems of the episcopal office. The Concordat of Worms\r\nin 1122 settled long disputes by giving both Pope and ruler a share in\r\nthe election. By the thirteenth century, however, the Pope had come to\r\nhave the upper hand in these ecclesiastical preferments. The total\r\nnumber of bishops in the thirteenth century was approximately\r\n700.[582:2] The duties of the bishop were both spiritual and temporal.\r\nHis office was one of the most important in the mediæval Church. He\r\nruled over a diocese of any number of parish churches, but had his own\r\nespecial church, which was called the cathedral, and usually surpassed\r\nall other churches of the diocese in size and beauty. He saw to it that\r\npublic services were conducted in the proper manner. He overlooked the\r\nadministration of charity. He tried to secure efficient subordinates who\r\nwould fulfil all their duties, and he alone could ordain new priests or\r\ndegrade the old. He enforced discipline and canon law. He exercised the\r\nrights of confirmation and holy orders, and consecrated _res sacræ_ like\r\nchurches and shrines. He usually supervised the monastic houses in his\r\ndiocese.[583:1] And he himself conducted religious services of a special\r\ncharacter in his cathedral or _domus dei_. He assumed judicial power\r\nover his clergy and in case of misbehaviour punished them by deposition\r\nor confinement in a cloister. He passed judgment on all questions of\r\nmarriage, wills, oaths, usury, and similar subjects. In general each\r\nbishop, under the authority of the representative of St. Peter, was a\r\nlittle pope over that section of the Church which was under his\r\njurisdiction[583:2] and he was regarded as the direct successor of the\r\nApostles. On the temporal side the bishop was a landlord, governed a\r\nlarge estate, and performed those governmental duties which the king,\r\nparticularly in Germany, thrust upon him. He did not own the land, but\r\nonly used it. He himself was often a vassal, had a large number of\r\nvassals and sub-vassals under him, collected feudal dues from his\r\ninferiors, paid feudal tributes to his superiors, and was an integral\r\npart of the feudal system. His installation to office was invariably\r\naccompanied by the ceremony of feudal investiture. Indeed from many\r\nstandpoints he was more of a feudal lord than a churchman. It is easy to\r\nsee, therefore, what a powerful factor the bishop was in both secular\r\nand ecclesiastical affairs, and how sweeping was his influence.\r\n\r\nThere were several deviations from the regular office of bishop. The\r\nchor-bishop or \"country bishop,\" who was little more than an assistant\r\nof the city bishop, had gradually died out by the thirteenth\r\ncentury.[584:1] The honorary bishop, or titular bishop, a title first\r\napplied to missionary bishops, still existed in Europe but with no\r\nregular diocese. The progress of Mohammedanism drove many regular\r\nbishops away from their episcopal seats in Asia, Africa, and Spain. But\r\nthey were allowed to retain their titles and functions even though\r\ndeprived of their dioceses, and successors were regularly elected. Again\r\nduring the Crusades many bishoprics were established in the East.\r\nThrough the failure of the Crusades, however, these bishops lost their\r\ndioceses, but they too were permitted to retain their titles in the hope\r\nof eventually recovering their possessions. They likewise served as\r\nassistants to bishops in western Europe and their successors were\r\nregularly appointed by the Pope. They became very independent and often\r\ncaused the regular bishops much trouble. Efforts were made later to get\r\nrid of them but without success.\r\n\r\nConnected with each bishop's cathedral was a chapter which probably grew\r\nout of the original college of presbyters who assisted the bishop in his\r\nspiritual and secular duties. As time passed and the Church grew these\r\npresbyters came to be attached to the cathedral as a distinct body of\r\nthe clergy. By the ninth century these clergy came to be known as a\r\nchapter and consisted of either the \"seculars,\" _i.e._, the clergy not\r\nbound by monastic vows and living in separate houses, or the \"regulars,\"\r\n_i.e._, the clergy living as monks in a common building. Thus the\r\nchapter came to have a regular organisation with officers whose duties\r\nwere more or less clearly defined. At the head stood the bishop; then\r\nthe dean, the real acting head; and after him the precentor, or chanter,\r\nwho was a musical director; the chancellor, who had charge of the\r\neducation of younger members, the library, correspondence, and the\r\ndelivery of lectures and sermons; the treasurer, who was responsible for\r\nthe funds of the church, the sacred vessels, the altar furniture, and\r\nthe reliquaries; the sub-dean, the sub-chanter, and vice-chancellor; and\r\nthe archdeacons, whose number depended on the size of the diocese, who\r\nexecuted episcopal orders, who acted as inspectors and had minor\r\njudicial functions, and who became so independent and powerful that the\r\noffice was abolished in the twelfth century.[585:1] The remaining\r\nmembers of the chapter were called canons or prebendaries. During the\r\nabsence of the canons their duties were performed by substitutes called\r\nvicars.\r\n\r\nEach chapter had its own laws, endowments, fees, revenues, and\r\njurisdiction over lands. The chapters often came into open conflict with\r\nthe bishops[585:2] and tended to form alliances with Popes and rulers\r\nagainst the episcopal authorities. It was not uncommon, either, to find\r\nchapters practically independent of the bishops with members appointed\r\ndirectly by the Pope. These bodies exercised great powers--they called\r\ncouncils, they tried clerical cases, they even excommunicated, and as\r\nlittle Colleges of Cardinals, usually at the king's suggestion, elected\r\nbishops.[586:1] Membership in a chapter was regarded as a fat berth and\r\nhence eagerly sought by leading families of nobility.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the hierarchical scale stood the priests who presided\r\nover the parishes, which were divided into city, village, and rural\r\nparishes, and were the lowest divisions of the Church. As a rule a\r\nparish contained at least ten families and varied from that to a\r\nconsiderable village, or a large section of a town. The appointment of\r\nthe priests was made by the \"Patron\" of the parochial church, _i.e._,\r\nthe person who owned the church property, whether a layman or a clerical\r\nperson. The appointee was confirmed by the bishop. Churches were thus\r\nfrequently handed about from one owner to another like any feudal\r\nproperty and consequently the tendency was to secularise the priests as\r\nwell as the higher clergy. Seeing this evil the monastic orders sought\r\nto reform the abuse by bringing priests under their control. The income\r\nof the priest was derived from lands belonging to the parish church,\r\nfrom tithes, and from contributions, but as a rule it was scarcely more\r\nthan enough to meet his scanty needs.[586:2] The priest was the only\r\nChurch officer who came continually into direct touch with the masses of\r\nthe people and, consequently, he it was who really controlled the\r\ndestiny of both their bodies and souls. In addition to conducting the\r\nregular services, he could administer or withhold the sacraments so\r\nnecessary to salvation, and hence the destiny of all men rested in his\r\nhands. He absolved, baptised, married, and buried his parishioners. He\r\nmonopolised the auricular confession and through it regulated the\r\nconscience, determined conduct, and cured the soul of sin. If advice and\r\npenance failed to keep the incorrigible sinner in the path of\r\nrighteousness, his case could be carried to the spiritual court of the\r\nbishop, who had practically unlimited power. Each priest had not only\r\ncertain duties to perform, but also possessed distinct rights and\r\nprivileges, and a supernatural character which put him and his property\r\nabove the common level of humanity. No longer a citizen of a state, the\r\nChurch was his country, his home, and his family. No matter what crime\r\nhe committed, the secular power could not arrest him--only a religious\r\ntribunal could try him and such bodies never shed human blood. Hence\r\npunishments for misdemeanours were comparatively light.\r\n\r\nThe parish church was the unit of mediæval civilisation and the priest\r\nwas looked up to as the natural guardian of the community. He cared for\r\nboth the souls and bodies of his flock. In addition to using every\r\nagency to induce his members to lead godly lives, it was his business to\r\nsee that no dangerous characters lurked in the villages--heretics,\r\nsorcerers, or lepers.\r\n\r\nThe clergy were separated from the laity by a very pronounced\r\ndifferentiation. The sacred character imparted to the priesthood by the\r\nsacrament of ordination, the holy calling of the man of God who held in\r\nhis hands the power of spiritual life and death, and the enforcement of\r\nthe canon of celibacy after a bitter struggle of more than a century,\r\nall tended to emphasise and magnify the wide gulf between the clergy and\r\nthe laymen. The sacerdotal office was most highly respected as the\r\ncertain avenue to social service, to fame, and to honour. It is no\r\nsurprise, therefore, to see men of all ranks entering the ministry of\r\nthe Church. For those of humble birth, the opportunity thus offered was\r\nabout the only means of promotion in Europe. Once in the Church, talent\r\nand energy could always overcome lowly origin, and attain elevation to a\r\nhigh place. The annals of the hierarchy are full of the examples of\r\nthose who rose from the meanest social ranks to the most commanding\r\npositions. Many of the greatest and best Popes had that\r\nexperience.[588:1] Thus the Church constantly recruited its ranks with\r\nvigorous fresh blood. Not even the lot of the prince was envied by the\r\npriest. \"Princes,\" asserted John of Salisbury, \"derive their power from\r\nthe Church, and are servants of the priesthood.\" Honorius of Autun\r\nwrote, \"The least of the priestly order is worthier than any king.\" A\r\ngreat thing it truly was for the future of Europe that in those rough\r\nages there existed a moral force superior to noble descent, to blue\r\nblood, and to martial prowess to point out the correct path, to uphold\r\nright, and to sanction eternal justice.\r\n\r\nThe _corpus juris canonici_, or canon law, which regulated all the\r\nworkings of the hierarchy, included all the rules enacted by the Church\r\nfor its relation with the secular power, for its own internal\r\nadministration, and for the duties and conduct of its members. It\r\ndiffered from the _jus ecclesiasticum_, or ecclesiastical law, in\r\nhaving the Church for its source, while the latter had the Church for\r\nits subject. The Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals continued to be the\r\nconstitution of the Church. Various commentaries, all based upon the\r\nDecretals as the chief repertory, were made by prominent\r\nchurchmen.[589:1] Gratian, a Camaldolensian monk, a professor in Bologna\r\nUniversity, in 1250 first taught canon law as a distinct and complete\r\nsystem like Roman law. He published the _Decretum Gratiani_, a\r\nscientific digest of all canon laws, which soon superseded all other\r\ncodifications and became the basis for many later commentaries.[589:2]\r\nCanon law was studied in all the mediæval universities. Regular\r\nfaculties of canon law were established, which granted the degree of\r\n_doctores decretorum_ after a course of six years' study. It was not\r\nlong, therefore, until the Church was given a class of keen,\r\nwell-drilled lawyers who gradually extended ecclesiastical jurisdiction\r\nover all religious duties; over baptisms, marriages, and deaths, and\r\nhence over legitimacy and succession; over all persons under religious\r\nvows, and consequently over the clergy, crusaders, widows, orphans, and\r\nminors; over heresy, blasphemy, and sacrilege; and over adultery,\r\nbigamy, fraud, and perjury. The canon law of the Church must also be\r\ngiven credit for laying the foundation for international law and serving\r\nas a model for constitutional law.\r\n\r\nThe papal penitentiary, or court, grounded on the \"power of the keys,\"\r\npossessed original and appellate powers of first instance and last\r\nresort. It originated in 1215 at Rome and consisted of a body of\r\ncanonists and theologians who acted as a unit under powers granted by\r\nthe Pope.[590:1] It attempted to decide all cases of morals and\r\ndiscipline, oftentimes in virtual ignorance of the facts. During the\r\nthirteenth century penitentiaries were appointed in every bishopric to\r\ntake cognisance of cases. Thus the eagle eyes of the supreme court of\r\nRome were fastened on every breach of law throughout Christendom.\r\nNaturally many abuses were connected with such a system. In 1022 the\r\nCouncil of Seligenstadt complained that Rome had extended her\r\njurisdiction even over the laity.[590:2] Through local representatives\r\nthe papal penitentiary practically nullified the discipline of bishops\r\nand granted virtual immunity to offenders. Venality was an accompanying\r\nevil from the beginning. Absolution could easily be secured by the rich\r\nand influential and dispensations were sold for money. Of course this\r\ncondition produced disastrous effects on morals. \"Rome was a fountain of\r\npardon for all infractions of the decalogue.\" Bishop Grosseteste\r\ndeclared about 1250 that the low morality of the priesthood was due to\r\nthis system. Pardon was granted to both sides of the controversy. A\r\npriest stole a book from his own church, pawned it for money, and then\r\nexcommunicated the unknown thief. He was discovered but pardoned on the\r\nground that he could not interdict himself. Monks and nuns bought their\r\nway into convents and then purchased absolution for the act.\r\n\r\nBy the thirteenth century the Roman ritual in the Latin language was\r\npractically in universal use. The Slavish liturgy had disappeared and in\r\nSpain alone the old national liturgy still lingered, though even there\r\nthe Roman ritual was permitted. Latin had become the general official\r\nlanguage of the Church. But it was not uncommon to give in the\r\nvernacular, besides the regular announcements, the confession of faith,\r\nthe confession of sin with the general absolution, intercessions for the\r\nliving and the dead, and the Lord's Prayer.\r\n\r\nAt this period of the Church's greatest power there was a noticeable\r\nrevival of preaching caused by the monastic reformers like the\r\nClugniacs, Cistercians, Dominicans, and Franciscans who earnestly\r\npreached repentance, and also by the tremendous crusading enthusiasm.\r\nAll the heroes of monasticism, scholasticism, and the papal hierarchy\r\nwere forceful preachers.[591:1] To accommodate these preachers pulpits\r\nwere built against a pillar or in a corner of a nave. To the masses on\r\npopular occasions, and even in the regular services, they spoke in the\r\nvernacular, but all stately addresses in synods and councils were\r\ndelivered in the speech of Rome. Popes and councils urged the importance\r\nof rearing a race of learned clergy who could give the Church\r\nintelligent leadership. The synod of Treves in 1221 went so far as to\r\nforbid uneducated and inexperienced priests to preach, because it caused\r\nmore harm than good. As a result of this wide-spread preaching the\r\nChurch was given a unity of doctrine and feeling which it had not\r\nenjoyed before.\r\n\r\nThe number of sacraments was generally recognised by the thirteenth\r\ncentury as seven.[592:1] Peter Lombard's _Sentences_ first outlined them\r\nand Thomas Aquinas (d. 1274) practically established them, although they\r\nwere not officially adopted until the Council of Florence in 1439.\r\nTheoretically the sacraments were believed to confer grace, \"the fulness\r\nof divine life,\" upon the recipients and to make them different persons\r\nwith new characters. This change was produced by God through the Church\r\nand was based upon the idea that this life should be consecrated and\r\nsanctified by religion in all its various relations. Hence baptism\r\nsuggested birth to a new spiritual life free from the sin due to Adam's\r\nfall; the Lord's Supper gave nutriment to preserve life and strength;\r\npenance indicated a recovery to health after sickness incident to sin;\r\nconfirmation marked the growth of righteous life to maturity; extreme\r\nunction suggested diet and exercise in convalescence and purified and\r\nrefreshed the spirit of the dying; ordination marked a promotion to a\r\nhigher consecrated life and to new duties; and marriage meant the\r\nassumption of new social relations which could never be severed. The\r\nChurch held that all these sacraments were instituted by Jesus and used\r\nby him personally, although baptism and the Lord's Supper were the most\r\nimportant. Peter Lombard said that if Christ did not employ them, the\r\nApostles at least did. Baptism, confirmation, and ordination, it was\r\nheld, imparted an indelible character, therefore could not be repeated.\r\nAll consecrations and blessings were looked upon as different from the\r\nsacraments and were called \"Sacramentalia.\" It was asserted also that\r\nthe administration of the sacraments in the hands of a bad priest was\r\nvalid.\r\n\r\nThe mass continued to be the heart, life blood, and very centre of all\r\nworship. It was believed to be a propitiatory sacrifice offered to God\r\nfor the sins of the world whenever the sacrament was celebrated. Christ\r\nwas recrucified as on the cross at each mass. The eucharist gave\r\nspiritual nourishment to the communicant, averted evils and brought\r\nblessings, and, with penance, removed the guilt of sin.\r\nTransubstantiation became a fixed dogma in the thirteenth century. Up to\r\nthe ninth century the Church unanimously believed that the real body and\r\nblood of Christ were administered to those who received the sacrament of\r\nthe eucharist, but Christians differed widely as to the nature and\r\nmanner of their presence and no Pope or council had settled the\r\nquestion. In 831 Radbert wrote a famous book on the subject in which he\r\nheld that after consecration only the figure of bread and wine was\r\npresent and that the rest was literal body and blood and that this body\r\nand blood was the same as that born of Mary, crucified, and raised from\r\nthe dead. This work created a warm discussion which lasted for four\r\ncenturies and provoked many bitter individual quarrels. Innocent III. in\r\n1215 settled the dispute by making the dogma of transubstantiation a\r\npart of the constitutional law of the Church and at the same time\r\nordered all the laity to go to confession and to partake of the\r\neucharist at least once a year. The dogma did not pass unquestioned,\r\nalthough the common people had no difficulty in believing it.[593:1] As\r\na result it led to the deification of the bread and wine, to the use of\r\nbeautiful golden or silver urns and cups for them, to the construction\r\nof a costly tabernacle in which to keep the sacred elements, to lamps\r\nand decorations, to solemn processions, to a pompous ceremony, to bowing\r\nthe knee before the host in the church and on the streets and to prayer\r\nto the host as the most important part of worship, and to the\r\ncelebration throughout the whole Church of an annual festival of the\r\nHoly Sacrament (1264). The cup was withheld from the laity[594:1] and\r\ngiven only to the priests after the eleventh century because it was\r\nfeared that the wine might be spilled and also because it was believed\r\nthat the body and blood of Jesus were fully present in both\r\nelements.[594:2] Wafers, called the host, were substituted for the\r\nbroken bread. The mass soon became an object of commerce. Private masses\r\nfor the living and particularly for the dead, begun in the eighth\r\ncentury, were very common in the thirteenth, so much so, in fact, that\r\ncertain priests had no other function than that of saying masses for the\r\ndead. All over Christendom endowments were given for these masses and an\r\narmy of priests did nothing else. By refusing mass the clergy could\r\nexert strong pressure on individuals and governments. The mass was held\r\nto be absolutely necessary to salvation, and the eucharist was even\r\ngiven to little children, although in the thirteenth century it was\r\nrestricted to children under seven. It also had a marked effect upon\r\nchurch architecture by increasing the number of altars in the church in\r\norder to accommodate the increasing number of private masses. All the\r\nphysical and metaphysical education of the age turned upon the question\r\nof the mass.[595:1]\r\n\r\nPenance played a very important part in the Church in the thirteenth\r\ncentury and received its final form in the Council of Florence in 1439.\r\nAs early as the fifth century a regular criminal code developed in the\r\nChurch and in the seventh century a Grecian monk who was archbishop\r\nenacted a body of severe laws for penitential discipline which remained\r\nin authority until the twelfth century. The climax was reached in the\r\nthirteenth century when every diocese had its own penitential code and\r\npublic penance had been replaced by private penance. Penance was simply\r\nthe punishment prescribed by the priest to remove the guilt of sin, and\r\nusually consisted of fasts, prayers, pilgrimages, and acts of charity\r\nand mercy. The Church early permitted penance to be paid by substituting\r\nmoney payments for some pious enterprise.[595:2] Furthermore, it was\r\ngenerally held that penance afflicted on one person could be paid by\r\nanother; for example, a penance of seven years could be accomplished in\r\nseven days by a sufficient number of co-workers.[595:3] Even Thomas\r\nAquinas said that as long as the debt was paid it mattered little who\r\npaid it. Indulgences and papal pardons paralleled the history of\r\npenance. The power to show leniency, or to shorten or to lengthen the\r\ncharacter or the time of penance, was early recognised to be in the\r\nbishop's hands.[595:4] From this idea there gradually arose a regular\r\nsystem of commutation which reached the highest point during the\r\ncrusade movement. The theory was most fully stated by Thomas\r\nAquinas[596:1] and Alexander of Hales.[596:2] They asserted that after\r\nthe remission of the eternal punishment due for sin there still remained\r\na temporal punishment to be undergone either in this life or in\r\npurgatory; that temporal pain might be remitted by the application of\r\nthe superabundant merits of Christ and the saints out of the treasury of\r\nthe Church. The hierarchy was the custodian of that prerogative. But\r\nindulgence could be granted only to those who were in full communion\r\nwith the Church and who manifested a contrite heart, made confession,\r\nand submitted to penance.[596:3] Penances were either general or local,\r\nor plenary or partial. The use of indulgences was very much abused since\r\nthey were often granted only for money and because they were employed\r\nfor trivial and secular purposes like building bridges[596:4] and\r\nimproving roads.[596:5] They were even applied to the dead.[596:6] The\r\ndoctrine of purgatory had developed by the twelfth century and was\r\ngenerally accepted in the thirteenth.[596:7]\r\n\r\nAuricular confession, which seems to have been fully developed by the\r\ntime of Innocent I.,[596:8] was required by Innocent III. after 1216 of\r\nall Church members at least once a year under penalty of exclusion from\r\nthe Church. It was an essential part of the sacrament of penance and\r\ngave the priests a tremendous power over the people which was used both\r\nfor good and ill. The synod of Toulouse in 1229 insisted on compulsory\r\nconfession at Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost. Any breach of the\r\nconfessional was visited by the fourth Lateran Council with\r\nexcommunication, deposition, and imprisonment for life in a monastery.\r\nConfession was the bridle by means of which the laity were guided by the\r\npriesthood, hence the Church laid more and more importance upon the\r\nnecessity of the practice as a duty.\r\n\r\nAbsolution grew up as a necessary part of auricular confession. Before\r\nthe thirteenth century the priest acted ministerially and used the form:\r\n_domus absolvat te--misercatur tui omnipotens deus et dimittat tibi\r\nomnia peccata tua_. These words are still found in the Greek Church and\r\nare also allowable in the Roman Catholic service. After the thirteenth\r\ncentury, however, the priest acted judicially and said: _ego absolvo\r\nte_. The priest's forgiveness was God's forgiveness. The requisites for\r\nabsolution were: contrition of heart, promise of amendment of life, and\r\nreparation.\r\n\r\nExtreme unction as a sacrament came into use rather late. Peter Lombard\r\ngave it fifth place among the seven sacraments. Original sin was atoned\r\nfor in baptism, actual sins by penance, and extreme unction wiped away\r\nall remaining sins which would hinder the soul from entering its perfect\r\nrest. Hence it was given only to those who were mortally ill. In case of\r\nrecovery, however, it could be repeated.[597:1] The eyes, ears, nose,\r\nmouth, hands, loins, and feet (except of women) were anointed with holy\r\noil consecrated by the bishop on Maundy Thursday. Confession and\r\ncommunion preceded the rite. These three together constituted the\r\n_viaticum_ of the soul on its long journey.\r\n\r\nFrom the time when private meeting places gave way to places of public\r\nworship, throughout its whole career, the Church has employed art for\r\npurposes of utility and instruction. The transitional character of the\r\nthirteenth century along social, ecclesiastical, intellectual, and\r\npolitical lines was also strongly marked in art. In the conflict between\r\nfeudalism and royalty, monarchy gradually gained ground. The problem of\r\nhuman right appeared along with the problem of human might. Out of the\r\ncomposite struggle of kings, feudal barons, popes, bishops, abbots, and\r\nfree cities emerged the recognised supremacy of papal authority as the\r\none power above and behind all others. The episcopacy stood for the\r\nrights of the Pope, on the one hand, and the rights of the people, on\r\nthe other. Next to the papal supremacy, stood the kingly prerogative.\r\nUnder the double patronage of the Church and the state ecclesiastical\r\nart advanced with rapid strides.\r\n\r\nGothic architecture reached its highest development during the\r\nthirteenth century. Europe was covered with magnificent churches,\r\ncathedrals, and monasteries. Architecture was the dominant art of the\r\nMiddle Ages. The church building occupied a unique place in the\r\ncommunity. Everybody was a member of the Church and attended the one\r\nsacred edifice in the parish. The erection and beautifying of a new\r\nchurch was a matter of interest to all. Local pride was deeply touched.\r\nA strong rivalry soon developed, which led each village and city to\r\noutdo their neighbours by erecting larger, more expensive, and more\r\nbeautiful chapels and cathedrals. The church of that day was the centre\r\nnot alone of religious activity, but also of local politics, of\r\ncommunity business, of social gatherings, of education, and of the fine\r\narts. It was the very heart of all life, and, hence, members lavished\r\ntheir affection, their time, and their wealth on it. Nothing in our\r\ncommunity life to-day can be well compared with the church of that day.\r\nIt was the town hall, art museum, club, public library, school, and\r\nchurch all in one. With us the religious interest of every community is\r\ndivided among various denominations, while the differentiation of our\r\nother institutions has destroyed the earlier unity of interest.\r\n\r\nThe Gothic churches with pointed arches and flying buttresses lightened\r\nthe masonry of the hitherto massive walls, pierced them with great,\r\nbeautiful stained glass windows, and allowed the sunlight to stream into\r\nthe dark interiors. Then mosaics, sculpture, fresco, and painting were\r\nused to enrich and decorate the inner parts. Mouldings and capitals,\r\npulpits, altars, side chapels, choir screens, the wooden seats for the\r\nclergy and choristers, the reading desk, and the tombs were literally\r\ncovered with carvings of leaf and flower forms, of familiar animals and\r\ngrotesque monsters, of biblical scenes and ordinary incidents. The\r\nexteriors of these wonderful structures, which were marvels of lightness\r\nand delicacy of detail, were usually ornamented with an army of statues\r\nrepresenting apostles, saints, donors, and rulers. Is it a matter of\r\nsurprise that the bishops and clergy, who ruled over these Christian\r\ntemples erected in love, in prayer, and in self-sacrifice, should be\r\nhonoured and obeyed? These wonderful houses of religion were the glad\r\nfree-will offerings of a devout and believing people to the mighty\r\nRoman Catholic Church of which they were the proud, privileged members.\r\n\r\nA splendid picture of the beautiful devotion of the people of a region\r\nin the erection of a magnificent cathedral is found in Chartres, France.\r\nThat wonderful edifice was begun in 1194 and completed in 1240. To\r\nconstruct a building that would beautify their city and satisfy their\r\nreligious aspirations the citizens contributed of their strength and\r\nproperty year after year for nearly half a century. Far from home they\r\nwent to the distant quarries to dig out the rock. Encouraged by their\r\npriests they might be seen, men, women, and children, yoked to clumsy\r\ncarts loaded with building materials. Day after day their weary journey\r\nto and from the quarries continued. When at night they stopped, worn out\r\nwith the day's toil, their spare time was given up to confession and\r\nprayer. Others laboured with more skill but with equal devotion on the\r\ngreat cathedral itself. As the grand edifice grew year by year from\r\nfoundation stone to towers, the inhabitants watched it with pious\r\njealousy. At length it was completed; not, however, until many who had\r\nlaboured at the beginning had passed away. Its dedication and\r\nconsecration marked an epoch in that part of France.\r\n\r\nMost historians are prone to dwell upon the evils of the Church in this\r\nperiod, as if they far outweighed the good. Many bishops were worldly\r\nand wicked, therefore the conclusion is drawn that all bishops were of\r\nthat character, whereas out of the 700 bishops in Europe a very large\r\nproportion were comparatively faithful shepherds who were striving with\r\nall their might to realise the high ideals for which the Church stood.\r\nMany of the clergy were guilty of gross immorality, hence comes the\r\nsweeping assertion that all the clergy were unfit for their high and\r\nnoble calling, while as a matter of fact, thousands of the priests\r\nobeyed the laws of the Church, led model God-fearing lives, and\r\ncontinually pointed out to their people the high and certain path to\r\nsalvation. Abuses, corruptions, extortions, did exist in every quarter\r\nof Christendom. Bad clergymen did use their high prerogatives for base\r\npurposes. Many bishops, abbots, and priests were no more worthy to be\r\ngiven extensive powers in trust than the unscrupulous politicians who\r\noften secure high places in our municipal, state, and national\r\ngovernments. The sinecures and benefices of the Church offered the same\r\ntemptations to money-making and to questionable methods that our civil\r\noffices do to-day to the dishonest and unscrupulous office-holders. But\r\nall of the officials in the Church in the thirteenth century were no\r\nmore guilty of these evils than are all public men in the United States\r\nto-day addicted to the practices of the base political tricksters. It\r\nseems to be a universal fact that one bad man in the Church attracts\r\nmore attention and creates more comment than a multitude of good men.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental causes of the numerous evil practices in the Church are\r\nfound in the wealth and power of the Roman ecclesiastical organisation,\r\non the one hand, and the comparatively low moral standards of\r\ncivilisation, on the other. Throughout its whole remarkable career of\r\nthirteen hundred years, the Catholic Church had denounced the bad and\r\ntaught the good. Unfortunately in attempting to realise the kingdom of\r\nGod on earth through that organisation which was assumed to be of divine\r\norigin, life and practice did not always harmonise with the doctrines\r\ninculcated. The ideal and the real are seldom brought to coincide in any\r\nhuman institutions and it would be expecting a realisation of the\r\nwell-nigh impossible to hope to see the consummation of that desirable\r\ncondition in the mediæval Church when all the contradictory factors and\r\nforces are taken into account. But it can be safely asserted, when all\r\ndebits and credits of baneful and beneficial are given just\r\nconsideration, that the mighty Church at its height was the most\r\npowerful force in Europe for justice, for mercy, for charity, for peace\r\namong men, for honesty, for temperance, for human rights, for social\r\nservice, for culture, for domestic purity, for obedience to law and\r\norder, and for a noble, helpful Christian life both for individuals and\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nThe sublime foundations on which the Church rested,[602:1] the\r\nmarvellous history it could point to, its peerless organisation, its\r\nvast wealth, its strong grip on the faith of the people, its close\r\nalliance with the state, all combined to make its officers, the clergy,\r\nthe most influential social class in Europe. In their hands were the\r\nkeys of heaven and without their permission no one could hope to enter;\r\nsince they were about the only educated class, they wrote the books and\r\ndirected all advance along intellectual, literary, and artistic lines.\r\nIn short they moulded the progress of that day. They wrote public\r\ndocuments and proclamations for rulers, sat in royal councils, and acted\r\nas governmental ministers.[602:2] They dominated every human interest,\r\nregulated more or less every phase of life in the Middle Ages, and\r\nconferred inestimable benefit upon Europe of that day and this.\r\n\r\nThe Church in this age was the dominant factor in European civilisation.\r\nIt fashioned laws and dictated the policy of governments; it controlled\r\neducation and intelligence; it influenced occupations and industries; it\r\nmoulded social ideas and customs; and it set the standards of morality\r\nand determined the life and conduct of both this world and that to come.\r\nThe Church was divided into two sharply defined classes: the laity and\r\nthe priesthood. \"The great division of mankind, which . . . had become\r\ncomplete and absolute, into the clergy . . . and the rest of mankind,\r\nstill subsisted in all of its rigorous force. They were two castes,\r\nseparate and standing apart as by the irrepealable law of God. They were\r\ndistinct, adverse, even antagonistic, in their theory of life, in their\r\nlaws, in their corporate property, in their rights, in their immunities.\r\nIn the aim and object of their existence, in their social duties and\r\nposition, they were set asunder by a broad, deep, impassable\r\nline.\"[603:1] The priesthood, with an indelible character, married to\r\nthe Church, stood between God and man and tended to become \"The Church.\"\r\n\r\nThe Church was essentially an organised state, thoroughly centralised,\r\nwith one supreme head and a complete gradation of officials; with a\r\ncomprehensive system of law courts for trying cases, with penalties\r\ncovering all crimes, and with prisons for punishing offenders. It\r\ndemanded an allegiance from all its members somewhat like that existing\r\nto-day between subjects and a state. It developed one official language,\r\nthe Latin, which was used to conduct its business everywhere. Thus all\r\nwestern Europe was one great religious association from which it was\r\ntreason to revolt. Canon law punished such a crime with death, public\r\nopinion sanctioned it, and the secular arm executed the sentence.\r\n\r\n     The Church Militant was thus an army encamped on the soil of\r\n     Christendom, with its outposts everywhere, subject to the most\r\n     efficient discipline, animated with a common purpose, every\r\n     soldier panoplied with inviolability and armed with the\r\n     tremendous weapons which slew the soul. There was little that\r\n     could not be dared or done by the commander of such a force,\r\n     whose orders were listened to as oracles of God, from Portugal\r\n     to Palestine and from Sicily to Iceland.[604:1]\r\n\r\n     History records no such triumph of intellect over brute force\r\n     as that which, in an age of turmoil and battle, was wrested\r\n     from the fierce warriors of the time by priests who had no\r\n     material force at their command, and whose power was based\r\n     alone on the souls and consciences of men. Over soul and\r\n     conscience their empire was complete. No Christian could hope\r\n     for salvation who was not in all things an obedient son of the\r\n     Church, and who was not ready to take up arms in its defence;\r\n     and, in a time when faith was a determining factor of conduct,\r\n     this belief created a spiritual despotism which placed all\r\n     things within reach of him who could wield it.[604:2]\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century the mediæval Church was a completed\r\ninstitution and at the height of its power. Its rise from humble\r\nbeginnings, by a multitude of explainable causes and forces, to this\r\nlofty position is a well-nigh incredible miracle. It was very different\r\nfrom all modern churches whether Catholic or Protestant, yet was the\r\nmother of all of them. Both theoretically and legally all persons in\r\nwestern Europe belonged to it and were ruled by it, except those who\r\nwere expelled from it, and thus formed one mighty religious society, the\r\nlike of which has not again appeared in Christendom. Unable during\r\nsubsequent centuries to meet the demands of new and higher phases of\r\ncivilisation, the mediæval Church broke up into the various Christian\r\nsects of to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nA.--PRIMARY:\r\n\r\n  1.--Eales, _Life and Works of St. Bernard_.\r\n\r\n  2.--Henderson, _Historical Documents of the Middle Ages_.\r\n\r\n  3.--Lea, C.
