Yet by law the power\r\npassed to Nero on account of his adoption. No claim, indeed, is stronger\r\nthan that of arms. Every one who possesses superior force has always the\r\nappearance of both saying and doing what is more just. So Nero, having\r\nfirst disposed of Claudius's will and having succeeded him as master of\r\nthe whole empire, put Britannicus and his sisters out of the way. Why,\r\nthen, should one stop to lament the misfortunes of other victims?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--2--] The following signs of dominion had been observed in his\r\ncareer. At his birth just before dawn rays not cast by any beam of\r\nsunlight yet visible surrounded his form. And a certain astrologer from\r\nthis and from the motion of the stars at that time and their relation to\r\none another divined two things in regard to him,--that he would rule and\r\nthat he would murder his mother. Agrippina on hearing this became for the\r\nmoment so beside herself as actually to cry out: \"Let him kill me, if only\r\nhe shall rule.\" Later she was destined to repent bitterly of her prayer.\r\nSome people become so steeped in folly that if they expect to obtain some\r\nblessing mingled with evil, they at once through their anxiety for the\r\nadvantage pay no heed to the detriment. When the time for the latter also\r\ncomes, they are cast down and would choose not to have secured even the\r\ngreatest good thing. Yet Domitius, the father of Nero, had a sufficient\r\nprevious intimation of his son's coming baseness and licentiousness, not\r\nby any oracle but through the nature of his own and Agrippina's\r\ncharacters. And he declared: \"It is impossible for any good man to be born\r\nfrom me and from her.\" As time went on, the finding of a serpent skin\r\naround Nero's neck when he was but a boy caused the seers to say: \"He\r\nshall acquire great power from the aged man.\" Serpents are thought to\r\nslough off their old age with their old skin, and so get power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--3--] Nero was seventeen years of age when he began to rule. He\r\nfirst entered the camp, and, after reading to the soldiers all that Seneca\r\nhad written, he promised them as much as Claudius had been accustomed to\r\ngive. Before the senate he read such a considerable document,--this, too,\r\nwritten by Seneca,--that it was voted the statements should be inscribed\r\non a silver tablet and should be read every time the new consuls took up\r\nthe duties of their office. Consequently those who heard him made\r\nthemselves ready to enjoy a good reign according to the letter of the\r\ncompilation. At first Agrippina [in company with Pallas, a vulgar and\r\ntiresome man,] managed all affairs pertaining to the empire, and she and\r\nher son went about together, often reclining in the same litter; usually,\r\nhowever, she would be carried and he would follow alongside. It was she\r\nwho transacted business with embassies and sent letters to peoples and\r\ngovernors and kings. When this had gone on for a considerable time, it\r\naroused the displeasure of Seneca and Burrus, who were both the most\r\nsensible and the most influential of the advisers of Nero. The one was his\r\nteacher and the other was prefect of the Pretorians. They took the\r\nfollowing occasion to stop this method of procedure. An embassy of\r\nArmenians had arrived and Agrippina wished to ascend the platform from\r\nwhich Nero was talking with them. The two men, seeing her approach,\r\npersuaded the young man to go down before she could reach there and meet\r\nhis mother, pretending some form of greeting. After that was done they did\r\nnot return again, making some excuse to prevent the foreigners from seeing\r\nthe flaw in the empire. Subsequently they labored to keep any public\r\nbusiness from being again committed to her hands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--4--] When they had accomplished this, they themselves took\r\ncharge of the entire empire and gave it the very best and fairest\r\nmanagement that they could. Nero was not in general fond of affairs and\r\nwas glad to live at leisure. [The reason, indeed, that he had previously\r\ndistrusted his mother and now was fond of her lay in the fact that now he\r\nwas free to enjoy himself, and the government was being carried on no less\r\nwell. And his advisers after consultation made many changes in existing\r\ncustoms, abolishing some things altogether and passing a number of new\r\nlaws.] They let Nero sow his wild oats with the intention of bringing\r\nabout in him through the satisfaction of all his desires a changed\r\nattitude of mind, while in the meantime no great damage should be done to\r\npublic interests. Surely they must have known that a young and self-willed\r\nspirit, when reared in unreproved license and in absolute authority, so\r\nfar from becoming satiated by the indulgence of its passions is ruined\r\nmore and more by these very agencies. Indeed, Nero at first gave but\r\nsimple dinners; his revels, his drunkenness, his amours were moderate.\r\nAfterward, as no one reproved him for them and public business was carried\r\nforward none the worse for all of it, he began to believe that what he did\r\nwas right and that he could carry his practices to even greater lengths.\r\n[Consequently he began to indulge in each of these pursuits in a more open\r\nand precipitate fashion. And in case his guardians gave him any warning or\r\nhis mother any rebuke, he would appear abashed while they were present and\r\npromise to reform; but as soon as they were gone, he would again become\r\nthe slave of his desire and yield to those who were dragging him in the\r\nother direction,--a straight course down hill.] Next he came to despise\r\ninstruction, inasmuch as he was always hearing from his associates, \"Do\r\n_you_ submit to this?\" or \"Do _you_ fear these people?\", \"Don't\r\nyou know that you are Caesar?\", \"Have not you the authority over them\r\nrather than they over you?\" He was also animated by obstinacy, not wishing\r\nto acknowledge his mother as superior and himself as inferior, nor to\r\nadmit the greater good sense of Seneca and Burrus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--5--] Finally he passed the possibility of being shamed, dashed\r\nto the ground and trampled under foot all their suggestions, and began to\r\nfollow in the steps of Gaius. When he had once felt a desire to emulate\r\nhim, he quite outdid him, for he believed that the imperial power must\r\nmanifest itself among other ways by allowing no one to surpass it even in\r\nthe vilest deeds. [As he was praised for this by the crowds, and received\r\nmany pleasant compliments from them, he gave himself no rest. His doings\r\nwere at first confined to his home and associates, but were later on\r\ncarried abroad. Thus he attached a mighty disgrace to the whole Roman race\r\nand committed many outrages upon the individuals composing it. Innumerable\r\nacts of violence and insult, of rape and murder, were committed both by\r\nthe emperor himself and by those who at one time or another had influence\r\nwith him. And, as certainly and inevitably follows in all such practices],\r\ngreat sums of money naturally were spent, great sums unjustly procured,\r\nand great sums seized by force. For under no circumstances was Nero\r\nniggardly. Here is an illustration. He had ordered no less than two\r\nhundred and fifty myriads at one time to be given to Doryphorus, who\r\nattended to the state documents of his empire. Agrippina had it all piled\r\nin a heap, hoping by showing him the money all together to make him change\r\nhis mind. Instead, he asked how much the mass before him amounted to, and\r\nwhen he was informed he doubled it, saying: \"I was not aware that I had\r\nallowed him so little.\" It can clearly be seen, then, that as a result of\r\nthe magnitude of his expenditures he would quickly exhaust the treasures\r\nin the royal vaults and quickly need new revenues. Hence unusual taxes\r\nwere imposed and the property of the well-to-do was not left intact. Some\r\nlost their possessions to spite him and others destroyed themselves with\r\ntheir livelihoods. Similarly he hated and made away with some others who\r\nhad no considerable wealth; for, if they possessed any excellent trait or\r\nwere of a good family, he became suspicious that they disliked him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--6--] Such were the general characteristics of Nero. I shall\r\nnow proceed to details.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of horse-races Nero grew so enthusiastic that he adorned\r\nfamous race-horses that had passed their prime with the regular street\r\ncostume for men and honored them with money for their fodder. The\r\nhorsebreeders and charioteers, elated at this enthusiasm of his, proceeded\r\nto abuse unjustifiably even the praetors and consuls. But Aulus Fabricius,\r\nwhen praetor, finding that they refused to hold contests on fair terms,\r\ndispensed with them entirely. He trained dogs to draw chariots and\r\nintroduced them in place of horses. When this was done, the wearers of the\r\nwhite and of the red immediately entered their chariots: but, as the\r\nGreens and the Blues would not even then participate, Nero at his own cost\r\ngave the prizes to the horses, and the regular program of the circus was\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\nAgrippina showed readiness to attack the greatest undertakings, as is\r\nevidenced by her causing the death of Marcus Julius Silanus, to whom she\r\nsent some of the poison with which she had treacherously murdered her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nSilanus was governor of Asia, and was in no respect inferior to the\r\ngeneral character of his family. It was for this, more than for anything\r\nelse, she said, that she killed him, not wishing to have him preferred\r\nbefore Nero, by reason of the latter's manner of life. Moreover, she\r\nturned everything into trade and gathered money from the most\r\ninsignificant and basest sources.\r\n\r\nLaelianus, who was despatched to Armenia in place of Pollio, had been\r\nassigned to the command of the night watch. And he was no better than\r\nPollio, for, while surpassing him in reputation, he was all the more\r\ninsatiable in respect to gain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 55 (a.u. 808)] [Sidenote:--7--] Agrippina found a\r\ngrievance in the fact that she was no longer supreme in affairs of the\r\npalace. It was chiefly because of Acte. Acte had been brought as a slave\r\nfrom Asia. She caught the fancy of Nero, was adopted into the family of\r\nAttalus, and was cherished much more carefully than was Nero's wife\r\nOctavia. Agrippina, indignant at this and at other matters, first\r\nattempted to rebuke him, and set herself to humiliating his associates,\r\nsome by beatings and by getting rid of others. But when she accomplished\r\nnothing, she took it greatly to heart and remarked to him: \"It was I who\r\nmade you emperor,\" just as if she had the power to take away the authority\r\nfrom him again. She did not comprehend that every form of independent\r\npower given to any one by a private citizen immediately ceases to be the\r\nproperty of the giver and belongs to the one who receives it to use\r\nagainst his benefactor.\r\n\r\nBritannicus Nero murdered treacherously by poison, and then, as the skin\r\nwas turned livid by the action of the drug, he smeared the body with\r\ngypsum. But as it was being carried through the Forum a heavy rain falling\r\nwhile the gypsum was still damp washed it all away, so that the horror was\r\nexposed not only to comment but to view. [After Britannicus was dead\r\nSeneca and Burrus ceased to give careful attention to public interests and\r\nwere satisfied if they might manage them conservatively and still preserve\r\ntheir lives. Consequently Nero now made himself conspicuous by giving free\r\nrein to all his desires without fear of retribution. His behavior began to\r\nbe absolutely insensate, as is shown, for instance, by his punishing a\r\ncertain knight, Antonius, as a seller of poisons and by further burning\r\nthe poisons publicly. He took great credit for this action as well as for\r\nprosecuting some persons who had tampered with wills; but other people\r\nonly laughed to see him punishing his own acts in the persons of others.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--8--] His secret acts of licentiousness were many, both at home\r\nand throughout the City, by night and by day. He used to frequent the\r\ntaverns and wandered about everywhere like a private person. Any number of\r\nbeatings and insults took place in this connection and the evil spread to\r\nthe theatres, so that those who worked as dancers and who had charge of\r\nthe horses paid no attention either to praetors or to consuls. They were\r\ndisorderly themselves and led others to be the same, while Nero not only\r\ndid not restrain them even by words, but stirred them up all the more. He\r\ndelighted in their actions and used to be secretly conveyed in a litter\r\ninto the theatres, where unseen by the rest he watched the proceedings.\r\nIndeed, he forbade the soldiers who had usually been in attendance at all\r\npublic gatherings to appear there any longer. The reason he assigned was\r\nthat they ought not to superintend anything but strictly military affairs,\r\nbut his true purpose was to afford those who wished to raise a disturbance\r\nthe amplest scope. He made use of the same excuse in reference to his not\r\nallowing any soldier to attend his mother, saying that no one except the\r\nemperor ought to be guarded by them. In this way he displayed his enmity\r\ntoward the masses, and as for his mother he was already openly at variance\r\nwith her. Everything that they said to each other, or that the imperial\r\npair did each day, was reported outside the palace, yet it did not all\r\nreach the public and hence conjectures were made to supply missing details\r\nand different versions arose. What was conceivable as happening, in view\r\nof the baseness and lewdness of the pair, was noised abroad as having\r\nalready taken place, and reports possessing some credibility were believed\r\nas true. The populace, seeing Agrippina now for the first time without\r\nPretorians, took care not to fall in with her even by accident; and if any\r\none did chance to meet her he would hastily get out of the way without\r\nsaying a word.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--9--] At one spectacle men on horseback overcame bulls while\r\nriding along beside them, and the knights who served as Nero's personal\r\nguard brought down with their javelins four hundred bears and three\r\nhundred lions. On the same occasion thirty knights belonging to the\r\nmilitary fought in the arena. The emperor sanctioned such proceedings\r\nopenly. Secretly, however, he carried on nocturnal revels throughout the\r\nlength and breadth of the city, insulting the women, practicing lewdness\r\non boys, stripping those whom he encountered, striking, wounding,\r\nmurdering. He had an idea that his incognito was impenetrable, for he used\r\nall sorts of different costumes and false hair at different times: but he\r\nwould be recognized by his retinue and by his deeds. No one else would\r\nhave dared to commit so many and such gross outrages so recklessly.\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 56 (a.u. 809)] It was becoming unsafe even for a person to\r\nstay at home, since he would break into shops and houses. It came about\r\nthat a certain Julius Montanus, [Footnote: _C. Iulius Montanus C.F._\r\n(Cp. Suetonius, Life of Nero, chapter 60).] a senator, enraged on his\r\nwife's account, fell upon this reveler and inflicted many blows upon him,\r\nso that he had to remain several days in concealment by reason of the\r\nblack eyes he had received. Montanus did not suffer for it, since Nero\r\nthought the violence had been all an accident and was for showing no anger\r\nat the occurrence, had not the other sent him a letter begging his pardon.\r\nNero on reading the epistle remarked: \"So he knew that he was striking\r\nNero.\" The suicide of Montanus followed hard after.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 57 (a.u. 810)] In the course of producing a spectacle at\r\none of the theatres, he suddenly filled the place with sea-water so that\r\nthe fishes and sea-monsters [Footnote: [Greek: ktaenae] of the MSS. was\r\nchanged to [Greek: kaetae] on the conjecture of Sylburgius, who was\r\nfollowed by Bekker, Dindorf, and Boissevain. (Compare also Suetonius, Life\r\nof Nero, chapter 12).] swam in it, and had a naval battle between\r\n\"Persians\" and \"Athenians.\" At the close of it he suddenly withdrew the\r\nwater, dried the subsoil, and continued land contests, not only between\r\ntwo men at a time but with crowds pitted against other crowds.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 58 (a.u. 811)] [Sidenote:--10--] Subsequent to this,\r\noratorical contests took place, and as a result even of these numbers were\r\nexiled and put to death.--Seneca also was held to account, one of the\r\ncharges against him being that he was intimate with Agrippina. [It had not\r\nbeen enough for him to debauch Julia, nor had he become better as a result\r\nof exile, but he went on to make advances to such a woman as Agrippina,\r\nwith such a son.] Not only in this instance but in others he was convicted\r\nof doing precisely the opposite of what he taught in his philosophical\r\ndoctrines. He brought accusations against tyranny, yet he made himself a\r\nteacher of tyrants: he denounced such of his associates as were powerful,\r\nyet he did not hold aloof from the palace himself: he had nothing good to\r\nsay of flatterers, yet he had so fawned upon Messalina and Claudius's\r\nfreedmen [that he had sent them from the island a book containing eulogies\r\nupon them; this latter caused him such mortification that he erased the\r\npassage.] While finding fault with the rich, he himself possessed a\r\nproperty of seven thousand five hundred myriads; and though he censured\r\nthe extravagances of others, he kept five hundred three-legged tables of\r\ncedar wood, every one of them with identical ivory feet, and he gave\r\nbanquets on them. In mentioning these details I have at least given a hint\r\nof their inevitable adjuncts,--the licentiousness in which he indulged at\r\nthe very time that he made a most brilliant marriage, and the delight that\r\nhe took in boys past their prime (a practice which he also taught Nero to\r\nfollow). Nevertheless, his austerity of life had earlier been so severe\r\nthat he had asked his pupil neither to kiss him nor to eat at the same\r\ntable with him. [For the latter request he had a good reason, namely, that\r\nNero's absence would enable him to conduct his philosophical studies at\r\nleisure without being hindered by the young man's dinners. But as for the\r\nkiss, I can not conceive how that tradition came about. The only\r\nexplanation which one could imagine, namely, his unwillingness to kiss\r\nthat sort of mouth, is proved to be false by the facts concerning his\r\nfavorites. For this and for his adultery some complaints were lodged\r\nagainst him, but at this time he was himself released without formal\r\naccusations and succeeded in begging off Pallas and Burrus. Later on he\r\ndid not come out so well.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 59 (a.u. 811)] [Sidenote:--11--] There was a certain\r\nMarcus Salvius Otho, who through similarity of character and sharing in\r\nwrongdoing had become so intimate with Nero that he was not even punished\r\nfor saying one day to the latter: \"Then I hope you may see me Caesar.\" All\r\nthat came of it was the response: \"I sha'n't see you even consul.\" It was\r\nto him that the emperor gave Sabina, of patrician family, after separating\r\nher from her husband, and they both enjoyed her together. Agrippina,\r\ntherefore, fearing that Nero would marry the woman (for he was now\r\nbeginning to entertain a mad passion for her), ventured upon a most unholy\r\ncourse. As if it were not enough for her story that she had attracted her\r\nuncle Claudius into love for her by her blandishments and uncontrolled\r\nlooks and kisses, she undertook to enslave Nero also in similar fashion.\r\nHowever, I am not sure whether this actually occurred, or whether it was\r\ninvented to fit their characters: but I state here what is admitted by\r\nall, that Nero had a mistress resembling Agrippina of whom he was\r\nespecially fond because of this very resemblance. And when he toyed with\r\nthe girl herself or threw out hints about it to others, he would say that\r\nhe was having intercourse with his mother.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 59 (a.u. 812)] Sabina on hearing about this began to\r\npersuade Nero to get rid of his mother in order to forestall her alleged\r\nplots against him. He was likewise incited,--so many trustworthy men have\r\nstated,--by Seneca, whether it was to obscure the complaint against his\r\nown name that the latter was anxious or to lead Nero on to a career of\r\nunholy bloodguiltiness that should bring about most speedily his\r\ndestruction by gods and men. But they shrank from doing the deed openly\r\nand were not able to put her out of the way secretly by means of poison,\r\nfor she took extreme precautions against all such things. One day they saw\r\nin the theatre a ship that automatically separated in two, let out some\r\nbeasts, and came together again so as to be once more seaworthy; and they\r\nat once had another one built like it. By the time the ship was finished\r\nAgrippina had been quite won over by Nero's attentions, for he exhibited\r\ndevotion to her in every way to make sure that she should suspect nothing\r\nand be off her guard. He dared, however, do nothing in Rome for fear the\r\ncrime should become widely known. Hence he went some distance into\r\nCampania accompanied by his mother, and took a sail on the fatal ship\r\nitself, which was adorned in the most brilliant fashion to the end that\r\nshe might feel a desire to use the vessel continually.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--13--] When they reached Bauli, he gave for several days most\r\ncostly dinners at which he showed great solicitude in entertaining his\r\nmother. If she were absent he feigned to miss her sorely, and if she were\r\npresent he was lavish of caresses. He bade her ask whatever she desired\r\nand bestowed many gifts without her asking. When he had shaped the\r\nsituation to this extent [Footnote: Adopting Reiske's conjecture,\r\n_nv_.], then rising from dinner about midnight he embraced her, and\r\nstraining her to his breast kissed her eyes and hands, exclaiming:\r\n\"Mother, farewell, and happiness attend you! For you I live and because of\r\nyou I rule.\" He then gave her in charge of Anicetus, a freedman,\r\nsupposedly to convey her home on the ship that he had prepared.\r\n\r\nBut the sea would not endure the tragedy about to be enacted on it nor\r\nwould it submit to assume responsibility for the deception wrought by the\r\nmonstrous contrivance: therefore, though the ship parted asunder and\r\nAgrippina fell into the water, she did not perish. In spite of the fact\r\nthat it was dark and she was full of strong drink and that the sailors\r\nused their oar blades on her, so much so that they killed Acerronia Polla,\r\nher fellow voyager, she nevertheless saved her life and reached home.\r\nThereupon she affected not to realize that it was a plot and let not a\r\nword of it be known, but sent speedily to her son an account of the\r\noccurrence with the implication that it had happened by accident, and\r\nconveyed to him the good news (as she assumed it to be) that she was safe.\r\nNero hearing this could not endure the unexpected outcome but punished the\r\nmessenger as savagely as if he had come to assassinate him, and at once\r\ndespatched Anicetus with the sailors to make an end of his mother. He\r\nwould not entrust the killing of her to the Pretorians. When she saw them,\r\nshe knew for what they had come, and leaping from her bed tore open her\r\nclothing; exposing her abdomen, and cried out: \"Strike here, Anicetus,\r\nstrike here, for this bore Nero!\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--14--] Thus was Agrippina, daughter of Germanicus, grandchild of\r\nAgrippa, descendant of Augustus, slain by the very son to whom she had\r\ngiven the sovereignty and for whose sake she had killed her uncle and\r\nothers. Nero when informed that she was dead would not believe it, for the\r\nmonstrousness of his bold deed plunged him in doubts; therefore he desired\r\nto behold the victim with his own eyes. So he laid bare her body, looked\r\nher all over and inspected her wounds, finally uttering a remark far more\r\nabominable even than the crime. What he said was: \"I did not know I had so\r\nbeautiful a mother.\"\r\n\r\nTo the Pretorians he gave money evidently to secure their prayers for many\r\nsuch occurrences, and he sent to the senate a message in which he\r\nenumerated the offences of which he knew she was guilty, stating also that\r\nshe had plotted against him and on being detected had committed suicide.\r\nYet for all this calm explanation to the governing body he was frequently\r\nsubject to agitation at night, so that he would even leap suddenly from\r\nhis bed. And by day terror seized him at the sound of trumpets that seemed\r\nto blare forth some horrid din of war from the spot where lay Agrippina's\r\nbones. Therefore he went elsewhere. And when in his new abode he had again\r\nthe same experience, he distractedly transferred his residence to some\r\nother place.\r\n\r\nNero, not having a word of truth from any one and seeing that all approved\r\nwhat he had been doing, thought that either his actions had escaped notice\r\nor that he had conducted himself correctly. Hence he became much worse\r\nalso in other respects. He came to think that all that it was in his power\r\nto do was right and gave heed to those whose speech was prompted by fear\r\nor flattery as if they told absolute truth. For a time he was subject to\r\nfears and questionings, but, after the ambassadors had made him a number\r\nof pleasing speeches, he regained courage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--15--] The population of Rome, on hearing the report, though\r\nhorrified were nevertheless joyful, because they thought that now he would\r\nsurely come to ruin. Nearly all of the senators pretended to rejoice at\r\nwhat had taken place, participated in Nero's pleasure, and voted many\r\nmeasures of which they thought he would be glad. Publius Thrasea Paetus\r\nhad also come to the senate-house and listened to the letter. When,\r\nhowever, the reading was done, he at once rose without making any comment\r\nand went out. Thus what he would have said he could not, and what he could\r\nhave said he would not. He behaved in the same way under all other\r\nconditions. For he used to say: \"If it were a matter of Nero's putting\r\nonly me to death, I could easily pardon the rest who load him with\r\nflatteries. But since among those even who praise him so excessively he\r\nhas gotten rid of some and will yet destroy others, why should one stoop\r\nto indecent behavior and perish like a slave, when like a freeman one may\r\npay the debt to nature? There shall be talk of me hereafter, but of these\r\nmen not a word save for the single fact that they were killed.\" Such was\r\nthe kind of man Thrasea showed himself, and he would always encourage\r\nhimself by saying: \"Nero can kill me, but he can not harm me.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--16--] When Nero after his mother's murder reentered Rome,\r\npeople paid him reverence in public, but in private so long as any one\r\ncould speak frankly with safety they tore his character to very tatters.\r\nAnd first they hung by night a piece of hide on one of his statues to\r\nsignify that he himself ought to have a hiding. Second, they threw down in\r\nthe Forum a baby to which was fastened a board, saying: \"I will not take\r\nyou up for fear you may slay your mother.\"\r\n\r\nAt Nero's entrance into Rome they took down the statues of Agrippina. But\r\nthere was one which they did not cut loose soon enough, and so they threw\r\nover it a cloth which gave it the appearance of being veiled. Thereupon\r\nsomebody at once affixed to the statue the following inscription: \"I am\r\nabashed and thou art unashamed.\"\r\n\r\nIn many quarters at once, also, might be read the inscription:\r\n\r\n  \"Nero, Orestes, Alemeon, matricides.\"\r\n\r\nPersons could actually be heard saying in so many words: \"Nero put his\r\nmother out of the way.\" Not a few lodged information that certain persons\r\nhad spoken in this way, their object being not so much to destroy those\r\nwhom they accused as to bring reproach, on Nero. Hence he would admit no\r\nsuit of that kind, either not wishing that the rumor should become more\r\nwidespread by such means, or out of utter contempt for what was said.\r\nHowever, in the midst of the sacrifices offered in memory of Agrippina\r\naccording to decree, the sun suffered a total eclipse and the stars could\r\nbe seen. Also, the elephants drawing the chariot of Augustus entered the\r\nhippodrome and went as far as the senators' seats, but at that point they\r\nstopped and refused to proceed farther. And the event which one might most\r\nreadily conjecture to have taken place through divine means was that a\r\nthunderbolt descended upon his dinner and consumed it all as it was being\r\nbrought to him, like some tremendous harpy snatching away his food.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--17--] [In spite of this he killed by poison also his aunt\r\nDomitia, whom likewise he used to say he revered like a mother. He would\r\nnot even wait a few days for her to die a natural death of old age, but\r\nwas eager to destroy her also. His haste to do this was inspired by her\r\npossessions at Baiae and Ravenna, which included magnificent amusement\r\npavilions that she had erected and] are in fine condition even now. In\r\nhonor of his mother he celebrated a very great and costly festival, events\r\ntaking place for several days in five or six theatres at once. It was then\r\nthat an elephant was led to the very top of the vault of the theatre and\r\nwalked down from that point on ropes, carrying a rider. There was another\r\nexhibition at once most disgraceful and shocking. Men and women not only\r\nof equestrian but even of senatorial rank appeared in the orchestra, the\r\nhippodrome, and even the hunting-theatre, like the veriest outcasts. Some\r\nof them played the flute and danced or acted tragedies and comedies or\r\nsang to the lyre. They drove horses, killed beasts, fought as gladiators,\r\nsome willingly, others with a very bad grace. Men of that day beheld the\r\ngreat families,--the Furii, the Horatii, the Fabii, Poreii, Valerii, and\r\nall the rest whose trophies, whose temples were to be seen,--standing down\r\nbelow the level of the spectators and doing some things to which no common\r\ncitizen even would stoop. So they would point them out to one another and\r\nmake remarks, Macedonians saying: \"That is the descendant of Paulus\";\r\nGreeks, \"Yonder the offspring of Mummius\"; Sicilians, \"Look at Claudius\";\r\nthe Epirots, \"Look at Appius\"; Asiatics, \"There's Lucius\"; Iberians,\r\n\"There's Publius\"; Carthaginians, \"There's Africanus\"; Romans, \"There they\r\nall are\". Such was the expiation that the emperor chose to offer for his\r\nown indecency.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--18--] All who had sense, likewise, bewailed the multitude of\r\nexpenditures. Every costliest viand that men eat, everything else, indeed,\r\nof the highest value,--horses, slaves, teams, gold, silver, raiment of\r\nvaried hues,--was given away by tickets. Nero would throw tiny balls, each\r\none appropriately inscribed, among the populace and that article\r\nrepresented by the token received would be presented to the person who had\r\nseized it. The sensible, I say, reflected that, when he spent so much to\r\nprevent molestation in his disgraceful course, he would not be restrained\r\nfrom any most outrageous proceedings through mere hope of profit.\r\n\r\nSome portents had taken place about this time, which the seers declared\r\nimported destruction to him, and they advised him to divert the danger\r\nupon others. So he would have immediately put numbers of men out of the\r\nway, had not Seneca said to him: \"No matter how many you may slay, you can\r\nnot kill your successor.\"\r\n\r\nIt was now that he celebrated a corresponding number of \"Preservation\r\nSacrifices,\" as he called them, and dedicated the forum for the sale of\r\ndainties, called _Macellum_. [Sidenote:--19--] Somewhat later he\r\ninstituted a different kind of feast (called Juvenalia, a word that showed\r\nit belonged in some way to \"youth\"). The occasion was the shaving of his\r\nbeard for the first time. The hairs he cast into a small golden globe and\r\noffered to Jupiter Capitolinus. To furnish amusement members of the\r\nnoblest families as well as others did not fail to give exhibitions. For\r\ninstance, Aelia Catella danced: he was first of all a man prominent for\r\nfamily and wealth and also advanced in years,--he was eighty years of age.\r\nOthers who on account of old age or disease could not do anything on their\r\nown account sang as chorus. All devoted themselves to practicing as much\r\nas and by whatever way they were able. Regularly appointed \"schools\" were\r\nfrequented by the most distinguished men, women, girls, lads, old women,\r\nold men. In case any one was unable to appear in any other fashion, he\r\nwould enter the choruses. And whereas some of them out of shame had put on\r\nmasks to avoid being recognized, Nero at the request of the populace had\r\nthem taken off and showed these people to those by whom they had once been\r\nruled. Now most of all it was that these amateur performers and others\r\ndeemed the dead happy; for many of the foremost men this year had been\r\nslain. Some of them, charged with conspiracy against Nero, were surrounded\r\nby the soldiers and stoned to death.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--20--] And, as there needed to be a fitting climax to these\r\ndeeds, Nero himself appeared as an actor and Gallio [Footnote: _L.\r\nIunius Gallio_.] proclaimed him by name. There stood Caesar on the\r\nstage wearing the garb of a singing zither-player. Spoke the emperor: \"My\r\nlords, of your kindness give me ear.\" Then did the Augustus sing to the\r\nzither a thing called \"Attis or the Bacchantes,\" [Footnote: The title of\r\none of Nero's poems.] whilst many soldiers stood by and all the people\r\nthat the seats would hold sat watching. Yet had he (according to the\r\ntradition) but a slight voice and an indistinct, so that he moved all\r\npresent to laughter and tears at once. Beside him stood Burrus and Seneca\r\nlike teachers prompting a pupil: they would wave their hands and togas at\r\nevery utterance and draw others on to do the same. Indeed, Nero had ready\r\na peculiar corps of about five thousand soldiers, called Augustans; these\r\nwould begin the applause, and all the rest, however loath, were obliged to\r\nshout aloud with them,--except Thrasea. He would never stoop to such\r\nconduct. But the rest, and especially the prominent men, gathered with\r\nalacrity even when in grief and joined as if glad in all the shouts of the\r\nAugustans. One could hear them saying: \"Excellent Caesar! Apollo!\r\nAugustus! One like unto the Pythian! By thine own self, O Caesar, no one\r\ncan surpass thee!\" After this performance he entertained the people at a\r\nfeast on boats on the site of the naval battle given by Augustus: thence\r\nat midnight he sailed through a canal into the Tiber.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 60 (a.u. 813)] [Sidenote:--21--] This, then, he did to\r\ncelebrate the shaving of his chin. In behalf of his preservation and the\r\ncontinuance of his authority,--thus he gave notice,--he instituted\r\nquinquennial games, naming them Neronia. In honor of the event he also\r\nconstructed the gymnasium at the dedication of which he made a free\r\ndistribution of olive oil to the senators and knights. The crown for\r\nsinging to the zither, moreover, he took without a contest, for all others\r\nwere debarred on the assumption that they were unworthy of victory. [And\r\nimmediately in their garb he was enrolled on the very lists of the\r\ngymnasium.] Thenceforward all other crowns for zither playing at all the\r\ncontests were sent to him as the only person competent to win victories of\r\nthat sort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIO'S ROMAN HISTORY\r\n62\r\n\r\nAbout the disaster to the Romans in Britain, brought upon them by Buduica\r\n(chapters 1-7).\r\n\r\nPaulinus, returning from subduing the island of Mona, conquers in battle\r\n(chapters 8-12).\r\n\r\nOctavia Augusta and Burrus, likewise Plautus and Pallas, are put to death\r\nby Nero (chapters 13, 14).\r\n\r\nMost swinish reveling at the games of Tigillinus (chapter 15).\r\n\r\nHow Nero set the city on fire (chapters 16-18).\r\n\r\nThe uprightness of Corbulo: proceedings against Vologaesus and Tiridates\r\n(chapters 19, 20).\r\n\r\nMisfortune attends the endeavors of Paetus: Vologaesus forms a compact\r\nwith Corbulo (chapters 21-23).\r\n\r\nSeneca, Soranus, Thrasea, Sabina are put to death: Musonius and Cornutus\r\nare banished (chapters 24-29).\r\n\r\n\r\nDURATION OF TIME.\r\n\r\nNero Aug.

Two cities had\r\nbeen sacked, eight myriads of Romans and of their allies had perished, and\r\nthe island had been lost. Moreover, all this ruin was brought upon them by\r\na woman, a fact which in itself caused them the greatest shame. Heaven\r\nevidently gave them in advance an indication of the catastrophe. At night\r\nthere was heard to issue from the senate-house foreign jargon mingled with\r\nlaughter and from the theatre outcries with wailing: yet no mortal man had\r\nuttered the speeches or the groans. Houses under water came to view in the\r\nriver Thames, [Footnote: Compare Tacitus, Annals, XIV, 32 (\"visamque\r\nspeciem in aestuario Tamesae subversae Coloniae\").] and the ocean between\r\nthe island and Gaul sometimes grew bloody at flood-tide.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--2--] The _casus belli_ lay in the confiscation of the\r\nmoney which Claudius had given to the foremost Britons,--Decianus Catus,\r\ngovernor of the island, announcing that this must now be sent back. This\r\nwas one reason [Lacuna] [Footnote: It would seem natural to supply \"for the\r\nuprising,\" as does Reiske.] and another was that Seneca had lent them on\r\nexcellent terms as regards interest a thousand myriads that they did not\r\nwant, [Footnote: The meaning of this phrase ( [Greek: achousin]) is not\r\nwholly clear. Naber purposes to substitute [Greek: aitousin] (\"that they\r\nwere asking for\").] and had afterward called in this loan all at once and\r\nlevied on them for it with severity. But the person who most stirred their\r\nspirits and persuaded them to fight the Romans, who was deemed worthy to\r\nstand at their head and to have the conduct of the entire war, was a\r\nBritish woman, Buduica, [Footnote: Known commonly as Boadicea.] of the\r\nroyal family and possessed of greater judgment than often belongs to\r\nwomen. It was she who gathered the army to the number of nearly twelve\r\nmyriads and ascended a tribunal of marshy soil made after the Roman\r\nfashion. In person she was very tall, with a most sturdy figure and a\r\npiercing glance; her voice was harsh; a great mass of yellow hair fell\r\nbelow her waist and a large golden necklace clasped her throat; wound\r\nabout her was a tunic of every conceivable color and over it a thick\r\nchlamys had been fastened with a brooch. This was her constant attire. She\r\nnow grasped a spear to aid her in terrifying all beholders and spoke as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--3--] \"You have had actual experience of the difference between\r\nfreedom and slavery. Hence, though some of you previously through\r\nignorance of which was better may have been deceived by the alluring\r\nannouncements of the Romans, yet now that you have tried both you have\r\nlearned how great a mistake you made by preferring a self-imposed\r\ndespotism to your ancestral mode of life. You have come to recognize how\r\nfar superior is the poverty of independence to wealth in servitude. What\r\ntreatment have we met with that is not most outrageous, that is not most\r\ngrievous, ever since these men insinuated themselves into Britain? Have we\r\nnot been deprived of our most numerous and our greatest possessions\r\nentire, while for what remains we must pay taxes? Besides pasturing and\r\ntilling all the various regions for them do we not contribute a yearly sum\r\nfor our very bodies? How much better it would have been to be sold to\r\nmasters once and for all than to ransom ourselves annually and possess\r\nempty names of freedom! How much better to have been slain and perish\r\nrather than go about with subservient heads! Yet what have I said? Even\r\ndying is not free from expense among them, and you know what fees we\r\ndeposit on behalf of the dead. Throughout the rest of mankind death frees\r\neven those who are in slavery; only in the case of the Romans do the very\r\ndead live for their profit. Why is it that though none of us has any\r\nmoney,--and how or whence should we get it?,--we are stripped and\r\ndespoiled like a murderer's victims? How should the Romans grow milder in\r\nprocess of time, when they have conducted themselves so toward us at the\r\nvery start,--a period when all men show consideration for even newly\r\ncaptured beasts?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--4--] \"But, to tell the truth, it is we who have made ourselves\r\nresponsible for all these evils in allowing them so much as to set foot on\r\nthe island in the first place instead of expelling them at once as we did\r\ntheir famous Julius Caesar,--yes, in not making the idea of attempting the\r\nvoyage formidable to them, while they were as yet far off, as it was to\r\nAugustus and to Gaius Caligula. So great an island, or rather in one sense\r\na continent encircled by water, do we inhabit, a veritable world of our\r\nown, and so far are we separated by the ocean from all the rest of mankind\r\nthat we have been believed to dwell on a different earth and under a\r\ndifferent sky and some of their wisest men were not previously sure of\r\neven our exact name. Yet for all this we have been scorned and trampled\r\nunder foot by men who know naught else than how to secure gain. Still, let\r\nus even at this late day, if not before, fellow-citizens, friends and\r\nrelatives,--for I deem you all relatives, in that you inhabit a single\r\nisland and are called by [Footnote: Reading [Greek: chechlaemenous](van\r\nHerwerden).] one common name,--let us do our duty while the memory of\r\nfreedom still abides within us, that we may leave both the name and the\r\nfact of it to our children. For if we utterly lose sight of the happy\r\nconditions amid which we were born and bred, what pray will they do,\r\nreared in bondage?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--5--] \"This I say not to inspire you with a hatred of present\r\ncircumstances,--that hatred is already apparent,--nor with a fear of the\r\nfuture,--that fear you already have,--but to commend you because of your\r\nown accord you choose to do just what you ought, and to thank you for\r\ncooperating so readily with me and your own selves at once. Be nowise\r\nafraid of the Romans. They are not more numerous than are we nor yet\r\nbraver. And the proof is that they have protected themselves with helmets\r\nand breastplates and greaves and furthermore have equipped their camps\r\nwith palisades and walls and ditches to make sure that they shall suffer\r\nno harm by any hostile assault. [Footnote: Corruptions in the text emended\r\nby Reiske.] Their fears impel them to choose this method rather than\r\nengage in any active work like us. We enjoy such a superabundance of\r\nbravery that we regard tents as safer than walls and our shields as\r\naffording greater protection than their whole suits of mail. As a\r\nconsequence, we when victorious can capture them and when overcome by\r\nforce can elude them. And should we ever choose to retreat, we can conceal\r\nourselves in swamps and mountains so inaccessible that we can be neither\r\nfound nor taken. The enemy, however, can neither pursue any one by reason\r\nof their heavy armor nor yet flee. And if they ever should slip away from\r\nus, taking refuge in certain designated spots, there, too, they are sure\r\nto be enclosed as in a trap. These are some of the respects in which they\r\nare vastly inferior to us, and others are their inability to bear up under\r\nhunger, thirst, cold, or heat, as we can; for they require shade and\r\nprotection, they require kneaded bread and wine and oil, and if the supply\r\nof any of these things fails them they simply perish. For us, on the other\r\nhand, any root or grass serves as bread, any plant juice as olive oil, any\r\nwater as wine, any tree as a house. Indeed, this very region is to us an\r\nacquaintance and ally, but to them unknown and hostile. As for the rivers,\r\nwe swim them naked, but they even with boats can not cross easily. Let us\r\ntherefore go against them trusting boldly to good fortune. Let us show\r\nthem that they are hares and foxes trying to rule dogs and wolves.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--6--] At these words, employing a species of divination, she\r\nlet a hare escape from her bosom, and as it ran in what they considered a\r\nlucky direction, the whole multitude shouted with pleasure, and Buduica\r\nraising her hand to heaven, spoke: \"I thank thee, Andraste, [Footnote: Not\r\nmuch information is preserved regarding this indigenous goddess of\r\nBritain. Reimar asserts that she is practically identical with Boccharte,\r\nAstarte, or Venus.] and call upon thee, who are a woman, being myself also\r\na woman that rules not burden-bearing Egyptians like Nitocris, nor\r\nmerchant Assyrians like Semiramis (of these things we have heard from the\r\nRomans), nor even the Romans themselves, as did Messalina first and later\r\nAgrippina;--at present their chief is Nero, in name a man, in fact a\r\nwoman, as is shown by his singing, his playing the cithara, his adorning\r\nhimself:--but ruling as I do men of Britain that know not how to till the\r\nsoil or ply a trade yet are thoroughly versed in the arts of war and hold\r\nall things common, even children and wives; wherefore the latter possess\r\nthe same valor as the males: being therefore queen of such men and such\r\nwomen I supplicate and pray thee for victory and salvation and liberty\r\nagainst men insolent, unjust, insatiable, impious,--if, indeed we ought to\r\nterm those creatures men who wash in warm water, eat artificial dainties,\r\ndrink unmixed wine, anoint themselves with myrrh, sleep on soft couches\r\nwith boys for bedfellows (and past their prime at that), are slaves to a\r\nzither-player, yes, an inferior zither-player. Wherefore may this\r\nDomitia-Nero _woman_ reign no more over you or over me: let the wench\r\nsing and play the despot over the Romans. They surely deserve to be in\r\nslavery to such a being whose tyranny they have patiently borne already\r\nthis long time. But may we, mistress, ever look to thee alone as our\r\nhead.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--7--] After an harangue of this general nature Buduica led her\r\narmy against the Romans. The latter chanced to be without a leader for the\r\nreason that Paulinus their commander had gone on an expedition to Mona, an\r\nisland near Britain. This enabled her to sack and plunder two Roman\r\ncities, and, as I said, she wrought indescribable slaughter. Persons\r\ncaptured by the Britons underwent every form of most frightful treatment.\r\nThe conquerors committed the most atrocious and bestial outrages. For\r\ninstance, they hung up naked the noblest and most distinguished women, cut\r\noff their breasts and sewed them to their mouths, to make the victims\r\nappear to be eating them. After that they impaled them on sharp skewers\r\nrun perpendicularly the whole length of the body. All this they did to the\r\naccompaniment of sacrifices, banquets, and exhibitions of insolence in all\r\nof their sacred places, but chiefly in the grove of Andate,--that being\r\nthe name of their personification of Victory, to whom they paid the most\r\nexcessive reverence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--8--] It happened that Paulinus had already brought Mona to\r\nterms; hence on learning of the disaster in Britain he at once set sail\r\nthither from Mona. He was unwilling to risk a conflict with the barbarians\r\nimmediately, for he feared their numbers and their frenzy; therefore he\r\nwas for postponing the battle to a more convenient season. But as he grew\r\nshort of food and the barbarians did not desist from pressing him hard, he\r\nwas compelled, though contrary to his plan, to enter into an engagement\r\nwith them. Buduica herself, heading an army of about twenty-three myriads\r\nof men, rode on a chariot and assigned the rest to their several stations.\r\nNow Paulinus could not extend his phalanx the width of her whole line,\r\nfor, even if the men had been drawn up only one deep, they would not have\r\nstretched far enough, so inferior were they in numbers: nor did he dare to\r\njoin battle with one compact force, for fear he should be surrounded and\r\ncut down. Accordingly, he separated his army into three divisions in order\r\nto fight at several points at once, and he made each of the divisions so\r\nstrong that it could not easily be broken through. While ordering and\r\narranging his men he likewise exhorted them, saying:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--9--] \"Up, fellow-soldiers! Up, men of Rome! Show these pests\r\nhow much even in misfortune we surpass them. It is a shame for you now to\r\nlose ingloriously what but a short while ago you gained by your valor.\r\nOften have we ourselves and also our fathers with far fewer numbers than\r\nwe have at the present conquered far more numerous antagonists. Fear not\r\nthe host of them or their rebellion: their boldness rests on nothing\r\nbetter than headlong rashness unaided by arms and exercise. Fear not\r\nbecause they have set on fire a few cities: they took these not by force\r\nnor after a battle, but one was betrayed and the other abandoned. Do you\r\nnow exact from them the proper penalty for these deeds, that so they may\r\nlearn by actual experience what they undertook when they wronged such men\r\nas us.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--10--] After speaking these words to some he came to a second\r\ngroup and said: \"Now is the occasion, now, fellow-soldiers, for zeal, for\r\ndaring. If to-day you prove yourselves brave men, you will recover what\r\nhas slipped from your grasp. If you overcome this enemy, no one else will\r\nany longer withstand us. By one such battle you will both make sure of\r\nyour present possessions and subdue whatever is left. All soldiers\r\nstationed anywhere else will emulate you and foes will be terror-stricken.\r\nTherefore, since it is in your own hands either to rule fearlessly all\r\nmankind, both the nations that your fathers left under your control and\r\nthose which you yourselves have gained in addition, or else to be bereft\r\nof them utterly, choose rather to be free, to rule, to live in wealth, to\r\nenjoy prosperity, than through indolence to suffer the reverse of these\r\nconditions.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--11--] After making an address of this sort to the group in\r\nquestion, he came up to the third division and said also to them: \"You\r\nhave heard what sort of acts these wretches have committed against us, nay\r\nmore, you have even seen some of them. Therefore choose either yourselves\r\nto suffer the same treatment as previous victims and furthermore to be\r\ndriven entirely out of Britain, or else through victory to avenge those\r\nthat perished and also to give to the rest of mankind an example of mild\r\nclemency toward the obedient, of necessary severity toward the rebellious.\r\nI entertain the highest hopes of victory for our side, counting on the\r\nfollowing factors: first, the assistance of the gods; they usually\r\ncooperate with the party that has been wronged: second, our inherited\r\nbravery; we are Romans and have shown ourselves superior to all mankind in\r\nvarious instances of valor: next, our experience; we have defeated and\r\nsubdued these very men that are now arrayed against us: last, our good\r\nname; it is not worthy opponents but our slaves with whom we are coming in\r\nconflict, persons who enjoyed freedom and self-government only so far as\r\nwe allowed it. Yet even should the outcome prove contrary to our\r\nhope,--and I will not shrink from mentioning even this contingency,--it is\r\nbetter for us to fall fighting bravely than to be captured and impaled, to\r\nsee our own entrails cut out, to be spitted on red hot skewers, to perish\r\ndissolved in boiling water, when we have fallen into the power of\r\ncreatures that are very beasts, savage, lawless, godless. Let us therefore\r\neither beat them or die on the spot. Britain shall be a noble memorial to\r\nus, even though all subsequent Romans should be driven from it; for in any\r\ncase our bodies shall forever possess the land.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--12--] At the conclusion of exhortations of this sort and\r\nothers like them he raised the signal for battle. Thereupon they\r\napproached each other, the barbarians making a great outcry intermingled\r\nwith menacing incantations, but the Romans silently and in order until\r\nthey came within a javelin's throw of the enemy. Then, while the foe were\r\nadvancing against them at a walk, the Romans started at a given word and\r\ncharged them at full speed, and when the clash came easily broke through\r\nthe opposing ranks; but, as they were surrounded by the great numbers,\r\nthey had to be fighting everywhere at once. Their struggle took many\r\nforms. In the first place, light-armed troops might be in conflict with\r\nlight-armed, heavy-armed be arrayed against heavy-armed, cavalry join\r\nissue with cavalry; and against the chariots of the barbarians the Roman\r\narchers would be contending. Again, the barbarians would assail the Romans\r\nwith a rush of their chariots, knocking them helter-skelter, but, since\r\nthey fought without breastplates, would be themselves repulsed by the\r\narrows. Horseman would upset foot-soldier, and foot-soldier strike down\r\nhorseman; some, forming in close order, would go to meet the chariots, and\r\nothers would be scattered by them; some would come to close quarters with\r\nthe archers and rout them, whereas others were content to dodge their\r\nshafts at a distance: and all these things went on not at one spot, but in\r\nthe three divisions at once. They contended for a long time, both parties\r\nbeing animated by the same zeal and daring. Finally, though late in the\r\nday, the Romans prevailed, having slain numbers in the battle, beside the\r\nwagons, or in the wood: they also captured many alive. Still, not a few\r\nmade their escape and went on to prepare to fight a second time.\r\nMeanwhile, however, Buduica fell sick and died. The Britons mourned her\r\ndeeply and gave her a costly burial; but, as they themselves were this\r\ntime really defeated, they scattered to their homes.--So far the history\r\nof affairs in Britain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 62 (a.u. 815)] [Sidenote:--13--] In Rome Nero had before\r\nthis sent away Octavia Augusta, on account of his concubine Sabina, and\r\nsubsequently he put her to death. This he did in spite of the opposition\r\nof Burrus, who tried to prevent his sending her away, and once said to\r\nhim: \"Well, then, give her back her dowry\" (by which he meant the\r\nsovereignty). Indeed, Burrus used such unmitigated frankness that on one\r\noccasion, when he was asked by the emperor a second time for an opinion on\r\nmatters regarding which he had already made clear his attitude, he\r\nanswered bluntly: \"When I have once had my say about anything, don't ask\r\nme again.\" So Nero disposed of him by poison. He also appointed to command\r\nthe Pretorians a certain Ofonius Tigillinus, who outstripped all his\r\ncontemporaries in licentiousness and bloodiness. [It was he who won Nero\r\naway from them and made light of his colleague Rufus.] [Footnote:\r\n_Foenius Rufus._] To him the famous sentence of Pythias is said to have\r\nbeen directed. She had proved the only exception when all the other\r\nattendants of Octavia had joined Sabina in attacking their mistress,\r\ndespising the one because she was in misfortune and toadying to the other\r\nbecause her influence was strong. Pythias alone had refused though cruelly\r\ntortured to utter lies against Octavia, and finally, as Tigillinus\r\ncontinued to urge her, she spat in his face, saying:\r\n\r\n  \"My mistress's privy parts are cleaner, Tigillinus, than your mouth.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--14--] The troubles of his relatives Nero turned into laughter\r\nand jest. For instance, after killing Plautus [Footnote: _Rubellirs\r\nPlautus_.] he took a look at his head when it was brought to him and\r\nremarked: \"I didn't know he had such a big nose,\" as much as to say that\r\nhe would have spared him, had he been aware of this fact beforehand. And\r\nthough he spent practically his whole existence in tavern life, he forbade\r\nothers to sell in taverns anything boiled save vegetables and pea-soup. He\r\nput Pallas out of the way because the latter had accumulated great wealth\r\nthat could be counted by the ten thousand myriads. Likewise he was very\r\nliable to peevishness that showed in his behavior, and at such times he\r\nwould not speak a word to his servants or freedmen but write on tablets\r\nwhatever he wanted as well as any orders that he had to give them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 63 (a.u. 816)] [Sidenote:--15--] Indeed, when many of\r\nthose who had gathered at Antium perished, Nero made that, too, an\r\noccasion for a festival.\r\n\r\nA certain Thrasea gave his opinion to the effect that for a senator the\r\nextreme penalty should be exile.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 64 (a.u. 817)] To such lengths did\r\nNero's self-indulgence go that he actually drove chariots in public.\r\nAgain, one time after the slaughter of beasts he straightway brought water\r\ninto the theatre by means of pipes and produced a sea-fight: then he let\r\nthe water out again and arranged a gladiatorial combat. Last of all he\r\nflooded the place once more and gave a costly public banquet. The person\r\nwho had been appointed director of the banquet was Tigillinus, and a large\r\nand complete equipment had been furnished. The arrangements made were as\r\nfollows. In the center and resting on the water were placed the great\r\nwooden wine vessels, over which boards had been fastened. Round about it\r\nhad been built taverns and booths. Thus Nero and Tigillinus and their\r\nfellow-banqueters, being in the center, held their feast on purple carpets\r\nand soft mattresses, while all the other people caroused in the taverns.\r\nThese also entered the brothels, where unrestrictedly they might enjoy\r\nabsolutely any woman to be found there. Now the latter were some of the\r\nmost beautiful and distinguished in the city, both slaves and free, some\r\nhetaerae, some virgins, some wives,--not merely, that is to say, public\r\nwenches, but both girls and women of the very noblest families. Every man\r\nwas given authority to have whichever one he wished, for the women were\r\nnot allowed to refuse any one. Consequently, the multitude being a regular\r\nrabble, they drank greedily and reveled in wanton conduct. So a slave\r\ndebauched his mistress in the presence of his master and a gladiator\r\nravished a girl of noble family while her father looked on. The shoving\r\nand striking and uproar that went on, first on the part of those who were\r\ngoing in and second on the part of those who stood around outside, was\r\ndisgraceful. Many men met their death in these encounters, and of the\r\nwomen some were strangled and some were seized and carried off.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--16--] After this Nero had the wish (or rather it had always\r\nbeen a fixed purpose of his) to make an end of the whole city and\r\nsovereignty during his lifetime. Priam he deemed wonderfully happy in that\r\nhe had seen his country perish at the same moment as his authority.\r\nAccordingly he sent in different directions men feigning to be drunk or\r\nengaged in some indifferent species of rascality and at first had one or\r\ntwo or more blazes quietly kindled in different quarters: people, of\r\ncourse, fell into the utmost confusion, not being able to find any\r\nbeginning of the trouble nor to put any end to it, and meanwhile they\r\nbecame aware of many strange sights and sounds. For soon there was nothing\r\nto be observed but many fires as in a camp, and no other phrases fell from\r\nmen's lips but \"This or that is burning \"; \"Where?\"; \"How?\"; \"Who set\r\nit?\"; \"To the rescue!\" An extraordinary perturbation laid hold on all\r\nwherever they might be, and they ran about as if distracted, some in one\r\ndirection and some in another. Some men in the midst of assisting their\r\nneighbors would learn that their own premises were on fire. Others\r\nreceived the first intimation of their own possessions being aflame when\r\ninformed that they were destroyed. Persons would run from their houses\r\ninto the lanes with some idea of being of assistance from the outside, or\r\nagain they would dash into the dwellings from the streets, appearing to\r\nthink they could accomplish something inside. The shouting and screaming\r\nof children, women, men, and graybeards all together were incessant, so\r\nthat one could have no consciousness nor comprehension of anything by\r\nreason of the smoke and shouting combined. On this account some might be\r\nseen standing speechless, as if dumb. All this time many who were carrying\r\nout their goods and many more who were stealing what belonged to others\r\nkept encountering one another and falling over the merchandise. It was not\r\npossible to get anywhere, nor yet to stand still; but people pushed and\r\nwere pushed back, they upset others and were themselves upset, many were\r\nsuffocated, many were crushed: in fine, no evil that can possibly happen\r\nto men at such a crisis failed to befall them. They could not with ease\r\nfind even any avenue of escape, and, if any one did save himself from some\r\nimmediate danger, he usually fell into another one and was lost.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--17--] This did not all take place on one day, but lasted for\r\nseveral days and nights together. Many houses were destroyed through lack\r\nof some one to defend them and many were set on fire in still more places\r\nby persons who presumably came to the rescue. For the soldiers (including\r\nthe night watch), having an eye upon plunder, instead of extinguishing any\r\nblaze kindled greater conflagrations. While similar scenes were being\r\nenacted at various points a sudden wind caught the fire and swept it over\r\nwhatever remained. Consequently no one concerned himself any longer about\r\ngoods or houses, but all the survivors, standing in a place of safety,\r\ngazed upon what seemed to be many islands and cities burning. There was no\r\nlonger any grief over individual losses, for it was swallowed up in the\r\npublic lamentation, as men reminded one another how once before most of\r\ntheir city had been similarly laid waste by the Gauls. [Sidenote:--18--]\r\nWhile the whole population was in this state of mind and many crazed by\r\nthe disaster were leaping into the blaze itself, Nero mounted to the roof\r\nof the palace, where nearly the whole conflagration could be taken in by a\r\nsweeping glance, and having assumed the lyrist's garb he sang the Taking\r\n(as he said) of Ilium, which, to the ordinary vision, however, appeared to\r\nbe the Taking of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe calamity which the city at this time experienced has no parallel\r\nbefore or since, except in the Gallic invasion. The whole Palatine hill,\r\nthe theatre of Taurus, and nearly two-thirds of the remainder of the city\r\nwere burned and countless human beings perished. The populace invoked\r\ncurses upon Nero without intermission, not uttering his name but simply\r\ncursing those who had set the city on fire: and this was especially the\r\ncase because they were disturbed by the memory of the oracle chanted in\r\nTiberius's day. These were the words:--\r\n\r\n  \"Thrice three hundred cycles of tireless years being ended, Civil strife\r\n  shall the Romans destroy.\" [Footnote: Compare Book Fifty-seven, chapter\r\n  18.]\r\n\r\nAnd when Nero by way of encouraging them reported that these verses were\r\nnowhere to be found, they changed and went to repeating another oracle,\r\nwhich they averred to be a genuine Sibylline production, namely:--\r\n\r\n  \"Last of the sons of Aeneas a matricide shall govern.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it proved, whether this was actually revealed beforehand by some\r\ndivination or whether the populace now for the first time gave it the form\r\nof a divine saying adapted to existing circumstances. For Nero was indeed\r\nthe last emperor of the Julian line descended from Aeneas.\r\n\r\nHe now began to collect vast sums from both individuals and nations,\r\nsometimes using compulsion, with the conflagration for his excuse, and\r\nsometimes obtaining it by \"voluntary\" offers; and the mass of the Romans\r\nhad the food supply fund withdrawn.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--19--] While he was so engaged, he received news from Armenia\r\nand soon after a laurel wreath in honor of victory. The scattered bodies\r\nof soldiery in that region had been united by Corbulo, who trained them\r\nsedulously after a period of neglect, and then by the very report of his\r\ncoming had terrified both Vologaesus, king of Parthia, and Tiridates,\r\nchief of Armenia. He resembled the primitive Romans in that besides coming\r\nof a brilliant family and besides possessing much strength of body he was\r\nstill further gifted with a shrewd intelligence: and he behaved with great\r\nbravery, with great fairness, and with great good faith toward all, both\r\nfriends and enemies. For these reasons Nero had despatched him to the\r\nscene of war in his own stead and had entrusted to him a larger force than\r\nto anybody else, being equally assured that the man would subdue the\r\nbarbarians and would not revolt against him. And Corbulo proved neither of\r\nthese assumptions false.\r\n\r\nAll other men, however, had it as a particular grievance against him that\r\nhe kept faith with Nero. They were very anxious to get him as emperor in\r\nplace of the actual despot, and this conduct of his seemed to them his\r\nonly defect.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--20--] Corbulo, accordingly, had taken Artaxata without a\r\nstruggle and had razed the city to the ground. This exploit finished, he\r\nmarched in the direction of Tigranocerta, sparing all the districts that\r\nyielded themselves but devastating the lands of all such as resisted him.\r\nTigranocerta submitted to him voluntarily, and he performed other\r\nbrilliant and glorious deeds, as a result of which he induced the\r\nformidable Vologaesus to accept terms that accorded with the Roman\r\nreputation. [For Vologaesus, on hearing that Nero had assigned Armenia to\r\nothers and that Adiabene was being ravaged by Tigranes, made preparations\r\nhimself to go on a campaign into Syria against Corbulo, but sent into\r\nArmenia Monobazus, king of Adiabene, and Monaeses, a Parthian. These two\r\nhad shut up Tigranes in Tigranocerta. But since they did not succeed in\r\nharming him at all by their siege and as often as they tried conclusions\r\nwith him were repulsed by both the native troops and the Romans that were\r\nin his army, and since Corbulo guarded Syria with extreme care, Vologaesus\r\nrecognized the hopelessness of his attempt and disbanded his forces. Then\r\nhe sent to Corbulo and obtained peace on condition that he send a new\r\nembassy to Nero, raise the siege, and withdraw his soldiers from Armenia.\r\nNero made him no immediate nor speedy nor definite reply, but despatched\r\nLucius Caesennius Paetus to Cappadocia to see to it that there should be\r\nno Armenian uprising.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--21--] [So Vologaesus attacked Tigranocerta and drove back\r\nPaetus, who had come to its aid. When the latter fled he pursued him, beat\r\nback the garrison left by Paetus at the Taurus, and shut him up in\r\nRhandea, near the river Arsanias. Then he was on the point of retiring\r\nwithout accomplishing anything; for destitute as he was of heavy-armed\r\nsoldiers he could not approach close to the wall, and he had no large\r\nstock of provender, particularly as he had come at the head of a vast host\r\nwithout making arrangements for food supplies. Paetus, however, stood in\r\nterror of his archery, which took effect in the very camp itself, as well\r\nas of the cavalry, which kept appearing at all points. Hence he made peace\r\nproposals to his antagonist, accepted his terms, and took an oath that he\r\nwould himself abandon all of Armenia and that Nero should give it to\r\nTiridates. The Parthian was satisfied enough with this agreement, seeing\r\nthat he was to obtain control of the country without a contest and would\r\nbe making the Romans his debtors for a very considerable kindness. And, as\r\nhe learned that Corbulo (whom Paetus several times sent for before he was\r\nsurrounded) was drawing near, he dismissed the beleaguered soldiers,\r\nhaving first made them agree to build a bridge over the river Arsanias for\r\nhim. He was not really in need of a bridge, for he had crossed on foot,\r\nbut he wished to give them a practical example of the fact that he was\r\nstronger than they. Indeed, he did not retire by way of the bridge even on\r\nthis occasion, but rode across on an elephant, while the rest got over as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--22--] The capitulation had scarcely been made when Corbulo\r\nwith inconceivable swiftness reached the Euphrates and there waited for\r\nthe retreating force. When the two armies approached each other you would\r\nhave been struck with the difference between them and between their\r\ngenerals: one set were fairly aglow with delight at their rapidity; the\r\nothers were grieved and ashamed of their compact. Vologaesus sent Monaeses\r\nto Corbulo with the demand that the newcomer should give up the fort in\r\nMesopotamia. So they held a prolonged conference together right at the\r\nbridge crossing the Euphrates, after first destroying the center of the\r\nstructure. Corbulo having promised to leave the country if the Parthian\r\nwould also abandon Armenia, both of these things were done temporarily\r\nuntil Nero could learn the outcome of the engagements and begin\r\nnegotiations with the envoys of Vologaesus, whom the latter had sent a\r\nsecond time. The answer given them by the emperor was that he would bestow\r\nArmenia upon Tiridates if this aspirant would come to Rome. Paetus was\r\ndeposed from his command and the soldiers that had been with him were sent\r\nsomewhere else. Corbulo was again assigned to the war against the same\r\nfoes. Nero had intended to accompany the expedition in person, but after\r\nfalling down during the ceremony of sacrificing he would not venture to go\r\nabroad but remained where he was.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--23--] [Corbulo therefore officially prepared for war upon\r\nVologaesus and sent a centurion bidding him depart from the country.\r\nPrivately, however, he suggested to the king that he send his brother to\r\nRome, and this advice met with acceptance, since Corbulo seemed to have\r\nthe stronger force. Thus it came about that they both, Corbulo and\r\nTiridates, met at no other place than Rhandea, which suited them both. It\r\nappealed to the Parthian because there his people had cut off the Romans\r\nand had sent them away under a capitulation, a visible proof of the favor\r\nthat had been done them. To the Roman it appealed because his men were\r\ngoing to wipe out the ill repute that had attached to them there before.\r\nFor the meeting of the two was not limited merely to conversation; a lofty\r\nplatform had been erected on which were set images of Nero, and in the\r\npresence of crowds of Armenians, Parthians, and Romans Tiridates\r\napproached and did them reverence; after sacrificing to them and calling\r\nthem by laudatory names he took off the diadem from his head and set it\r\nupon them. Monobazus and Vologaesus also came to Corbulo and gave him\r\nhostages. In honor of this event Nero was a number of times saluted as\r\nimperator and held a triumph, contrary to precedent.] But Corbulo in spite\r\nof the large force that he had and the very considerable reputation that\r\nhe enjoyed did not rebel and was never accused of rebellion. He might\r\neasily have been made emperor, since men thoroughly detested Nero but all\r\nadmired him in every way. [In addition to the more striking features of\r\nhis submissive behavior he voluntarily sent to Rome his son-in-law Annius,\r\nwho served as his lieutenant; this was done professedly that Annius might\r\nescort Tiridates back, but in fact this relative stood in the position of\r\na hostage to Nero. The latter was so firmly persuaded that his general\r\nwould not revolt that Corbulo obtained his son-in-law as lieutenant\r\n[Footnote: Reading [Greek: hyparchon] (Boissevain) for [Greek: hypaton].]\r\nbefore he had been praetor.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 65 (a.u. 818)] [Sidenote:--24--] Seneca, however, and\r\nRufus the prefect and some other prominent men formed a plot against Nero.\r\nThey could no longer endure his ignoble behavior, his licentiousness, and\r\nhis cruelty. They desired at one and the same time to be rid of these\r\nevils and to give Nero his release from them. Indeed, Sulpicius Asper, a\r\ncenturion, and Subrius Flavius, a military tribune, both belonging to the\r\nbody-guards, admitted this to him point blank. Asper, when interrogated by\r\nthe emperor as to the reason for his attempt, replied: \"I could help you\r\nin no other way.\" And the response of Flavins was: \"I both loved you and\r\nhated you above all men. I loved you, hoping that you would prove a good\r\nemperor: I have hated you because you do so-and-so. I can not be slave to\r\ncharioteer or lyre-player.\"--Information was lodged and these men were\r\npunished, besides many others indirectly associated with them. Everything\r\nin the nature of a complaint that could be entertained against any one for\r\nexcessive joy or grief, for words or gestures, was brought forward and was\r\nbelieved. Not one of these complaints, even if fictitious, could be\r\nrefused credence in view of Nero's actual deeds. Hence conscienceless\r\nfriends and house servants of some men flourished greatly. Persons guarded\r\nagainst strangers and foes,--for of these they were suspicious,--but were\r\nbound to expose themselves whether they would or no to their associates.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--25--] It would be no small task to record details about most\r\nof those that perished, but the fate of Seneca needs a few words by\r\nitself. It was his wish to end the life of his wife Paulina at the same\r\ntime with his own, for he declared that he had taught her to despise death\r\nand that she desired to leave the world in company with him. So he opened\r\nher veins as well as his own. As he failed, however, to yield readily to\r\ndeath, his end was hastened by the soldiers; and his dying so speedily\r\nenabled Paulina to survive. He did not lay hands upon himself, however,\r\nuntil he had revised the book which he had composed and had deposited with\r\nvarious persons certain other valued possessions which he feared might\r\ncome into Nero's hands and be destroyed. Thus was Seneca forced to part\r\nwith life in spite of the fact that he had on the pretext of illness\r\nabandoned the society of the emperor and had bestowed upon him his entire\r\nproperty, supposedly to help defray the expense of necessary building\r\noperations. His brothers, too, perished after him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--26--] Likewise Thrasea and Soranus, who had no superiors in\r\nfamily, wealth, and every excellence, met their death not because they\r\nwere accused of conspiracy but because they were what they were. Against\r\nSoranus Publius Egnatius Celer, a philosopher, gave false evidence. The\r\nvictim had had two associates,--Cassius Asclepiodotus of Nicaea and this\r\nPublius of Berytus. Now Asclepiodotus so far from speaking against Soranus\r\nbore witness to his noble qualities; he was at the time exiled for his\r\npains, but later, under Galba, was restored. Publius in return for his\r\nservices as blackmailer received money and honors (as did others of the\r\nsame profession), but subsequently he was banished. Soranus was slain on\r\nthe charge of having caused his daughter to employ a species of magic, the\r\nfoundation for this story being that when he was sick his family had\r\noffered some sacrifices. Thrasea was executed for not appearing regularly\r\nat the senate-house, thus showing that he did not like the measures\r\npassed, for not listening to the emperor's singing and zither-playing, for\r\nnot sacrificing to Nero's Divine Voice as did the rest, and for not giving\r\nany public exhibitions: for it was remarked that at Patavium, his native\r\nplace, he had acted in a tragedy given in pursuance of some old custom at\r\na festival held every thirty years. As he made the incision in his artery,\r\nhe raised his hand, exclaiming: \"To thee, Jupiter, patron of freedom, I\r\npour this libation of blood.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--27--] [And Junius Torquatus, a descendant of Augustus, made\r\nhimself liable to a most strange indictment. He had squandered his\r\nproperty in a rather lavish way, whether following his native bent or with\r\nthe intention of not being very rich. Nero therefore declared that, as he\r\nlacked many things, he must be covetous of the goods of others, and\r\nconsequently caused a fictitious charge to be brought against him of\r\naspiring to imperial power.]\r\n\r\nAnd why should one be surprised that such complaints\r\nwere fastened upon them, [Footnote: A slight gap in the MS. exists here,\r\nfilled by a doubtful conjecture of Boissevain's.] seeing that one man\r\n[Footnote: _Salvidienus Orfitus_ (according to Suetonius, Life of\r\nNero, chap. 37).] was brought to trial and slain for living near the\r\nForum, for letting out some shops, or for receiving a few friends in them;\r\nand another [Footnote: _C. Cassius Longinus_ (ibid)..] because he\r\npossessed a likeness of Cassius, the murderer of Caesar?\r\n\r\nThe conduct of a woman named Epicharis also deserves mention. She had been\r\nincluded in the conspiracy and all its details had been trusted to her\r\nwithout reserve; yet she revealed none of these though often tortured in\r\nall the ways that the skill of Tigillinus could devise. And why should one\r\nenumerate the sums given to the Pretorians on the occasion of this\r\nconspiracy or the excessive honors voted to Nero and his friends? Let me\r\nsay only that it led to the banishment of Rufus Musonius, the philosopher.\r\nSabina also perished at this time through an act of Nero's. Either\r\naccidentally or intentionally he had given her a violent kick while she\r\nwas pregnant.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--28--] The extremes of luxury indulged in by this Sabina I will\r\nindicate in the briefest possible terms. She had gilded girths put upon\r\nthe mules that carried her and caused five hundred asses that had recently\r\nfoaled to be milked each day that she might bathe in their milk. She\r\ndevoted great thought to making her person appear youthful and lustrously\r\nbeautiful,--and with brilliant results; and this is why, not fancying her\r\nappearance in a mirror one day, she prayed that she might die before she\r\npassed her prime. Nero missed her so that [after her death, at first, on\r\nlearning that there was a woman resembling her he sent for and kept this\r\nfemale: later] because a boy of the _liberti_ class, named Sporus,\r\nresembled Sabina, he had him castrated and used him in every way like a\r\nwoman; and in due time he formally married him though he [Nero] was\r\nalready married to a freedman Pythagoras. He assigned the boy a regular\r\ndowry according to contract, and Romans as well as others held a public\r\ncelebration of their wedding.\r\n\r\nWhile Nero had Sporus the eunuch as a wife, one of his associates in Rome,\r\nwho had made a specialty of philosophy, on being asked whether the\r\nmarriage and cohabitation in question met with his approval replied: \"You\r\ndo well, Caesar, to seek the company of such wives. If only your father\r\nhad had the same ambition and had dwelt with a similar\r\nconsort!\"--indicating that if this had been the case, Nero would not have\r\nbeen born, and the government would have been relieved of great evils.\r\n\r\nThis was, however, later. At the time with which we are immediately\r\nconcerned many, as I stated, were put to death and many who purchased\r\ntheir preservation with Tigillinus with a great price were released.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--29--] Nero continued to commit many ridiculous acts, among\r\nwhich may be cited his descending at a kind of popular festival to the\r\norchestra of the theatre, where he read some Trojan lays of his own: and\r\nin honor of these there were offered numerous sacrifices, as there were\r\nover everything else that he did. He was now making preparations to\r\ncompile in verse a narration of all the achievements of the Romans: before\r\ncomposing any of it, however, he began to consider the proper number of\r\nbooks, and took as his adviser Annaeus Cornutus, who at this time was\r\nfamed for his learning. This man he came very near putting to death and\r\ndid deport to an island, because, while some were urging him to write four\r\nhundred books, Cornutus said that was too many and nobody would read them.\r\nAnd when some one objected: \"Yet Chrysippus, whom you praise and imitate,\r\nhas composed many more,\" the savant retorted: \"But they are a help to the\r\nconduct of men's lives.\" So Cornutus was punished with exile for this. And\r\nLucanus was enjoined from writing poetry because he was securing great\r\npraise for his work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIO'S ROMAN HISTORY\r\n63\r\n\r\nNero, receiving Tiridates with imposing state, places a crown upon his\r\nhead (chapters 1-7).\r\n\r\nHe journeys to Greece in order to become Periodonikes (chapters 8-10).\r\n\r\nWith the help of Tigillinus and Crispinilla he lays Greece waste: Helius\r\nand Polycletus perform the same office for Rome and Italy (chapters 11,\r\n12).\r\n\r\nNero's marriages and abominations with Sporus and Pythagoras (chapter 13).\r\n\r\nHis victories and proclamation: frenzy against Apollo: hatred toward the\r\nsenators (chapters 14, 15).\r\n\r\nDigging a canal through the Isthmus (chapter 16).\r\n\r\nDemise of the Scribonii, of Corbulo, of Paris, of the Sulpicii (chapters\r\n17, 18).\r\n\r\nAt the solicitation of Helius, Nero returning conducts an Iselasticum\r\ntriumph (chapters 19-21).\r\n\r\nVindex's conspiracy against Nero, and his extinction (chapters 22-24).\r\n\r\nRufus, saluted as Caesar and Augustus, refuses the sovereignty (chapter\r\n25).\r\n\r\nNero's flight and demise (chapters 26-29).\r\n\r\n\r\nDURATION OF TIME.\r\n\r\nC.

(A.D. 68 = a.u. 821,\r\nto June 9th).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 66 (a.u. 819)] [Sidenote:--1--] In the consulship\r\nof Gaius Telesinus and Suetonius Paulinus one event of great glory and\r\nanother of deep disgrace took place. For one thing Nero contended among\r\nthe zither-players, and after Menecrates, [Footnote: This proper name is\r\nthe result of an emendation by Reimar.]the teacher of this art, had\r\ncelebrated a triumph for him in the hippodrome, he appeared as a\r\ncharioteer. For the other, Tiridates presented himself in Rome, bringing\r\nwith him not only his own children but those of Vologaesus, of Pacorus,\r\nand of Monobazus. They were the objects of interest in a quasi-triumphal\r\nprocession through the whole country west from the Euphrates.\r\n[Sidenote:--2--] Tiridates himself was in the prime of life, a notable\r\nfigure by reason of his youth, beauty, family, and intelligence: and his\r\nwhole train of servants together with the entourage of a royal court\r\naccompanied the advance. Three thousand Parthian horsemen and besides them\r\nnumerous Romans followed his train. They were received by gaily decorated\r\ncities and by peoples who shouted their compliments aloud. Provisions were\r\nfurnished them free of cost, an expenditure of twenty myriads for their\r\ndaily support being thus charged to the public treasury. This went on\r\nwithout change for the nine months occupied in their journey. The prince\r\ncovered the whole distance to the confines of Italy on horseback and\r\nbeside him rode his wife, wearing a golden helmet in place of a veil, so\r\nas not to defy the traditions of her country by letting her face be seen.\r\nIn Italy he was conveyed in a two-horse carriage sent by Nero and met the\r\nemperor at Naples, which he reached by way of the Picentes. He refused,\r\nhowever, to obey the order to put down his dagger when he approached the\r\nRoman monarch, and he nailed it firmly to the scabbard. Yet he knelt upon\r\nthe ground, and with arms crossed called him master and did obeisance.\r\n[Sidenote:--3--] Nero manifested his approbation of this act and\r\nentertained him in many ways, one of which was a gladiatorial show at\r\nPuteoli. The person who directed the contests was Patrobius, one of his\r\nfreedmen. He managed to make it a brilliant and costly affair, as is shown\r\nby the fact that on one of the days not a person but Ethiopians, men,\r\nwomen, and children, appeared in the theatre. By way of showing Patrobius\r\nsome proper honor Tiridates shot at beasts from his elevated seat. And, if\r\nwe may trust the report, he transfixed and killed two bulls together with\r\none arrow.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--4--] After this affair Nero took him up to Rome and set the\r\ndiadem upon his head. The entire city had been decorated with lights and\r\ngarlands, and great crowds of people were to be seen everywhere, the\r\nForum, however, being especially full. The center was occupied by the\r\npopulace, arranged according to rank, clad in white and carrying laurel\r\nbranches: everywhere else were the soldiers, arrayed in shining armor,\r\ntheir weapons and standards reflecting back the sunbeams. The very roof\r\ntiles of the buildings in this vicinity were completely hidden from view\r\nby the spectators who had ascended to these points of vantage. Everything\r\nwas in readiness by the time night drew to a close and at daybreak Nero,\r\nwearing the triumphal garb and accompanied by the senate and the\r\nPretorians, entered the Forum. He ascended the rostra and seated himself\r\nupon the chair of state. Next Tiridates and his suite passed through rows\r\nof heavy-armed men drawn up on each side, took their stand close to the\r\nrostra, and did obeisance to the emperor as they had done before.\r\n[Sidenote:--5--] At this a great roar went up which so alarmed Tiridates\r\nthat for some moments he stood speechless, in terror of his life. Then,\r\nsilence having been proclaimed, he recovered courage and quelling his\r\npride made himself subservient to the occasion and to his need, caring\r\nlittle how humbly he spoke, in view of the prize he hoped to obtain. These\r\nwere his words: \"Master, I am the descendant of Arsaces, brother of the\r\nprinces Vologaesus and Pacorus, and thy slave. And I have come to thee, my\r\ndeity, to worship thee as I do Mithra. The destiny thou spinnest for me\r\nshall be mine: for thou art my Fortune and my Fate.\"\r\n\r\nNero replied to him as follows: \"Well hast thou done to come hither in\r\nperson, that present in my presence thou mayest enjoy my benefits. For\r\nwhat neither thy father left thee nor thy brothers gave and preserved for\r\nthee, this do I grant thee. King of Armenia I now declare thee, that both\r\nthou and they may understand that I have power to take away kingdoms and\r\nto bestow them.\" At the end of these words he bade him come up the\r\ninclined plane built for this very purpose in front of the rostra, and\r\nTiridates having been made to sit beneath his feet he placed the diadem\r\nupon his head. At this there was no end of shouts of all sorts.\r\n[Sidenote:--6--] According to decree there also took place a celebration\r\nin the theatre. Not merely the stage but the whole interior of the theatre\r\nround about had been gilded, and all properties brought in had been\r\nadorned with gold, so that people came to refer to the very day as\r\n\"golden.\" The curtains stretched across the sky-opening to keep off the\r\nsun were of purple and in the centre of them was an embroidered figure of\r\nNero driving a chariot, with golden stars gleaming all about him. So much\r\nfor the setting: and of course they had a costly banquet.\r\n\r\nAfterward Nero sang publicly with zither accompaniment and drove a\r\nchariot, clad in the costume of the Greens and wearing a charioteer's\r\nhelmet. This made Tiridates disgusted with him; but for Corbulo the\r\nvisitor had only praise and deemed the one thing against him to be that he\r\nwould put up with such a master. Indeed, he made no concealment of his\r\nviews to Nero's face, but one day said to him: \"Master, you have in\r\nCorbulo a good slave.\" The person addressed, however, did not comprehend\r\nhis speech.--In all other matters he flattered the emperor and ingratiated\r\nhimself most skillfully, with the result that he received all kinds of\r\ngifts, said to have possessed in the aggregate a value of five thousand\r\nmyriads, and obtained permission to rebuild Artaxata. Moreover, he took\r\nwith him from Rome many artisans, some of whom he got from Nero, and some\r\nwhom he persuaded by offers of high wages. Corbulo, however, would not let\r\nthem all cross into Armenia, but only the ones whom Nero had given him.\r\nThat caused Tiridates to admire him all the more and to despise his chief.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--7--] The return was made not by the same route as he followed\r\nin coming,--through Illyricum and north of the Ionian Gulf,--but instead\r\nhe sailed from Brundusium to Dyrrachium. He viewed also the cities of\r\nAsia, which helped to increase his amazement at the strength and beauty of\r\nthe Roman empire.\r\n\r\nTiridates one day viewed an exhibition of pancratium. One of the\r\ncontestants fell to the ground and was being pummeled by his opponent.\r\nWhen the prince saw it, he exclaimed: \"That's an unfair contest. It isn't\r\nfair that a man who has fallen should be beaten.\"\r\n\r\nOn rebuilding Artaxata Tiridates named it Neronia. But Vologaesus though\r\noften summoned refused to come to Nero, and finally, when the latter's\r\ninvitations became burdensome to him, sent back a despatch to this effect:\r\n\"It is far easier for you than for me to traverse so great a body of\r\nwater. Therefore, if you will come to Asia, we can then arrange [where we\r\nshall be able] to meet each other.\" [Such was the message which the\r\nParthian wrote at last.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--8--] Nero though angry at him did not sail against him, nor\r\nyet against the Ethiopians or the Caspian Pylae, as he had intended. [He\r\nsaw that the subjugation of these regions demanded time and labor and\r\nhoped that they would submit to him of their own accord:] and he sent\r\nspies to both places. But he did cross over into Greece, not at all as\r\nFlamininus or Mummius or as Agrippa and Augustus his ancestors had done,\r\nbut for the purpose of chariot racing, of playing and singing, of making\r\nproclamations, and of acting in tragedies. Rome was not enough for him,\r\nnor Pompey's theatre, nor the great hippodrome, but he desired also a\r\nforeign tour, in order to become, as he said, victor in all the four\r\ncontests. [Footnote: Literally \"victor of the periodos.\" This was a name\r\napplied to an athlete who had conquered in the Pythian, Isthmian, Nemean\r\nand Olympian games.] And a multitude not only of Augustans but of other\r\npersons were taken with him, large enough, if it had been a hostile host,\r\nto have subdued both Parthians and all other nations. But they were the\r\nkind you would have expected Nero's soldiers to be, and the arms they\r\ncarried were zithers and plectra, masks and buskins. The victories Nero\r\nwon were such as befitted that sort of army, and he overcame Terpnus and\r\nDiodorus and Pammenes, instead of Philip or Perseus or Antiochus. It is\r\nprobable that his purpose in forcing the Pammenes referred to, who had\r\nbeen in his prime in the reign of Gaius, to compete in spite of his age,\r\nwas that he might overcome him and vent his dislike in abuse of his\r\nstatues.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 67 (?)] [Sidenote:--9--] Had he done only this, he would\r\nhave been the subject of ridicule. So how could one endure to hear about,\r\nlet alone seeing, an emperor, an Augustus, listed on the program among the\r\ncontestants, training his voice, practicing certain songs, wearing long\r\nhair on his head but with his chin shaven, throwing his toga over his\r\nshoulder in the races, walking about with one or two attendants, eyeing\r\nhis adversaries suspiciously and ever and anon throwing out a word to them\r\nin the midst of a boxing match; how he dreaded the directors of the games\r\nand the wielders of the whip and spent money on all of them secretly to\r\navoid being shown up in his true colors and whipped; and how all that he\r\ndid to make himself victor in the citharoedic contest only contributed to\r\nhis defeat in the Contest of the Caesars? How find words to denounce the\r\nwickedness of this proscription in which it was not [Footnote: [Greek: oi]\r\nsupplied by Reiske.] Sulla that bulletined the names of others, but Nero\r\nbulletined his own name? What victory less deserves the name than that by\r\nwhich one receives the olive, the laurel, the parsley, or the fir-tree\r\ngarland, and loses the political crown? And why should one bewail these\r\nacts of his alone, seeing that he also by treading on the high-soled\r\nbuskins lowered himself from his eminence of power, and by hiding behind\r\nthe mask lost the dignity of his sovereignty to beg in the guise of a\r\nrunaway slave, to be led like a blind man, to conceive, to bear children,\r\nto go mad [to drive a chariot], as he acted out time after time the story\r\nof Oedipus, and of Thyestes, of Heracles and Alemeon, and of Orestes? The\r\nmasks he wore were sometimes made to resemble the characters and sometimes\r\nhad his own likeness. The women's masks were all fashioned to conform to\r\nthe features of Sabina [in order that though dead she might still move in\r\nstately procession. All the situations that common actors simulate in\r\ntheir acting he, too, would undertake to present, by speech, by action, by\r\nbeing acted upon,--save only that] golden chains were used to bind him:\r\napparently it was not thought proper for a Roman emperor to be bound in\r\niron shackles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--10--] All this behavior, nevertheless, the soldiers and all\r\nthe rest saw, endured, and approved. They entitled him Pythian Victor,\r\nOlympian Victor, National Victor, Absolute Victor, besides all the usual\r\nexpressions, and of course added to these names the honorific designations\r\nbelonging to his imperial office, so that every one of them had \"Caesar\"\r\nand \"Augustus\" as a tag.\r\n\r\nHe conceived a dislike for a certain man because while he was speaking the\r\nman frowned and was not overlavish of his praises; and so he drove him\r\naway and would not let him come into his presence. He persisted in his\r\nrefusal to grant him audience, and when the person asked: \"Where shall I\r\ngo, then?\" Phoebus, Nero's freedman, replied: \"To the deuce!\"\r\n\r\nNo one of the people ventured either to pity or to hate the wretched\r\ncreature. One of the soldiers, to be sure, on seeing him bound, grew\r\nindignant, ran up, and set him free. Another in reply to a question: \"What\r\nis the emperor doing?\" had to answer: \"He is in labor pains,\" for Nero was\r\nthen acting the part of Canace. Not one of them conducted himself in a way\r\nat all worthy of a Roman. Instead, because so much money fell to their\r\nshare, they offered prayers that he might give many such performances and\r\nthey in this way get still more.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--11--] And if things had merely gone on like this, the affair,\r\nwhile being a source of shame and of ridicule alike, would still have been\r\ndeemed free from danger. But as a fact he devastated the whole of Greece\r\nprecisely as if he had been despatched to some war and without regard to\r\nthe fact that he had declared the country free, also slaying great numbers\r\n[of men, women and children. At first he commanded the children and\r\nfreedmen of those who were executed to leave him half their property at\r\ntheir death, and allowed the original victims to make wills in order to\r\nmake it seem less likely that he had killed them for their money; and he\r\ninvariably took all that was bequeathed to him, if not more. In case any\r\none left to him or to Tigillinus less than they were expecting, the wills\r\nwere of no avail.--Later he deprived persons of their _entire_\r\nproperty and banished all their children at once by one decree. Not even\r\nthis satisfied him, but he destroyed not a few of the exiles.] For no one\r\ncould begin to enumerate all the confiscated possessions of men allowed to\r\nlive and all the votive offerings that he stole from the very temples in\r\nRome. [The despatch-bearers hurried hither and thither with no piece of\r\nnews other than \"kill this man!\" or that that man was dead. No private\r\nmessages, only state documents, were delivered; for Nero had taken many of\r\nthe foremost men to Greece under pretence of needing some assistance from\r\nthem merely in order that they might perish there. [Sidenote:--12--] The\r\nwhole population of Rome and Italy he surrendered like captives to a\r\ncertain Helius, a Caesarian. The latter had been given absolutely complete\r\nauthority, so that he might confiscate, banish, and put to death (even\r\nbefore notifying Nero) ordinary persons, knights, and senators alike.]\r\n\r\nThus the Roman domain was at that time a slave to two emperors at\r\nonce,--Nero and Helius; and I do not feel able to say which was the worse.\r\nIn most respects they behaved entirely alike, and the one point of\r\ndifference was that the descendant of Augustus was emulating\r\nzither-players, whereas the freedman of Claudius was emulating Caesars. I\r\nconsider the acts of Tigillinus as a part of Nero's career because he was\r\nconstantly with him: but Polyclitus and Calvia Crispinilla by themselves\r\nplundered, sacked, despoiled all the places they could get at. The former\r\nwas associated with Helius at Rome, and the latter with Sabina, born\r\nSporus. Calvia had been entrusted with the care of the boy and with the\r\noversight of the wardrobe, though a woman and of high rank; and she saw to\r\nit that all were stripped of their possessions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--13--] Now Nero called Sporus Sabina not merely on account of\r\nthe fact that by reason of resemblance to her he had been made a eunuch,\r\nbut because the boy like the mistress had been solemnly contracted to him\r\nin Greece, with Tigillinus to give the bride away, as the law ordained.\r\nAll the Greeks held a festal celebration of their marriage, uttering all\r\nthe customary good wishes (as they could not well help) even to the extent\r\nof praying that legitimate children might be born to them. After that Nero\r\ntook to himself two bedfellows, Pythagoras to treat as a man and Sporus as\r\na woman. The latter, in addition to other forms of address, was termed\r\nlady, queen, and mistress.\r\n\r\nYet why should one wonder at this, seeing that this monarch would fasten\r\nnaked boys and girls to poles, and then putting on the hide of a wild\r\nbeast would approach them and satisfy his brutal lust under the appearance\r\nof devouring parts of their bodies? Such were the indecencies of Nero.\r\n\r\nWhen he received the senators he wore a short flowered tunic with muslin\r\ncollar, for he had already begun to transgress precedent in wearing ungirt\r\ntunics in public. It is stated also that knights belonging to the army\r\nused in his reign for the first time saddle-cloths during their public\r\nreview.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--14--] At the Olympic games he fell from the chariot he was\r\ndriving and came very near being crushed to death: yet he was crowned\r\nvictor. In acknowledgment of this favor he gave to the Hellanodikai the\r\ntwenty-five myriads which Galba later demanded back from them. [And to the\r\nPythia he gave ten myriads for giving some responses to suit him: this\r\nmoney Galba recovered.] Again, whether from vexation at Apollo for making\r\nsome unpleasant predictions to him or because he was merely crazy, he took\r\naway from the god the territory of Cirrha and gave it to the soldiers. In\r\nfact, he abolished the oracle, slaying men and throwing them into the rock\r\nfissure from which the divine _afflatus_ arose. He contended in every\r\nsingle city that boasted any contest, and in all cases requiring the\r\nservices of a herald he employed for that purpose Cluvius Rufus, an\r\nex-consul. Athens and the Lacedaemonians were exceptions to this rule,\r\nbeing the only places that he did not visit at all. He avoided the second\r\nbecause of the laws of Lycurgus, which stood in the way of his designs,\r\nand the former because of the story about the Furies.--The proclamation\r\nran: \"Nero Caesar wins this contest and crowns the Roman people and his\r\nworld.\" Possessing according to his own statement a world, he went on\r\nsinging and playing, making proclamations, and acting tragedies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--15--] His hatred for the senate was so fierce that he took\r\nparticular pleasure in Vatinius, who kept always saying to him: \"I hate\r\nyou, Caesar, for being of senatorial rank.\"--I have used the exact\r\nexpression that he uttered.--Both the senators and all others were\r\nconstantly subjected to the closest scrutiny in their entrances, their\r\nexits, their attitudes, their gestures, their outcries. The men that stuck\r\nconstantly by Nero, listened attentively, made their applause distinct,\r\nwere commended and honored: the rest were both degraded and punished, so\r\nthat some, when they could endure it no longer (for they were frequently\r\nexpected to be on the _qui vive_ from early morning until evening),\r\nwould feign to swoon and would be carried out of the theatres as if dead.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--16--] As an incidental labor connected with his sojourn in\r\nGreece he conceived a desire to dig a canal across the isthmus of the\r\nPeloponnesus, and he did begin the task. Men shrank from it, however,\r\nbecause, when the first workers touched the earth, blood spouted from it,\r\ngroans and bellowings were heard, and many phantoms appeared. Nero himself\r\nthereupon grasped a mattock and by throwing up some of the soil fairly\r\ncompelled the rest to imitate him. For this work he sent for a large\r\nnumber of men from other nations as well.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--17--] For this and other purposes he needed great sums of\r\nmoney; and as he was a promoter of great enterprises and a liberal giver\r\nand at the same time feared an attack from the persons of most influence\r\nwhile he was thus engaged, he destroyed many excellent men. Of most of\r\nthese I shall omit any mention, merely saying that the stock complaint\r\nunder which all of them were brought before him was uprightness, wealth,\r\nand family: all of them either killed themselves or were slaughtered by\r\nothers. I shall pause to consider only Corbulo and (of the Sulpicii\r\nScribonii) Rufus and Proculus. These two deserve attention because they\r\nwere in a way brothers and contemporaries, never doing anything separately\r\nbut united in purpose and in property as they were in family: they had for\r\na long time administered the affairs of the Germanies and had come to\r\nGreece at the summons of Nero, who affected to want something from them. A\r\ncomplaint of the kind which that period so prodigally afforded was lodged\r\nagainst them. They could obtain no hearing on the matter nor even get\r\nwithin sight of Nero; and as this caused them to be slighted by all\r\npersons without exception, they began to long for death and so met their\r\nend by slitting open their veins.--And I notice Corbulo, because the\r\nemperor, after giving him also a most courteous summons and invariably\r\ncalling him (among other names) \"father\" and \"benefactor,\" then, as this\r\ngeneral approached Cenchrea, commanded that he be slain before he had even\r\nentered his presence. Some explain this by saying that Nero was about to\r\nsing with zither accompaniment and could not endure the idea of being seen\r\nby Corbulo while he wore the long ungirded tunic. The condemned man, as\r\nsoon as he understood the import of the order, seized a sword, and dealing\r\nhimself a lusty blow exclaimed: \"Your due!\" Now for the first time in his\r\ncareer was he ready to believe that he had done ill both in sparing the\r\nzither-player and in going to him unarmed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--18--] This is the substance of what took place in Greece. Does\r\nit add much to mention that Nero ordered Paris the dancer killed because\r\nhe wished to learn dancing from him and was disappointed? Or that he\r\nbanished Caecina Tuscus, governor of Egypt, for bathing in the tub that\r\nhad been specially constructed for his coming visit to Alexandria?\r\n\r\nIn Rome about this same time Helius committed many acts of outrage. One of\r\nthese was his killing of a distinguished man, Sulpicius Camerinus,\r\ntogether with his son; the complaint against them was that whereas they\r\nwere called _Pythici_ after some of their ancestors they would not\r\nabandon possession of this name, thus blaspheming Nero's Pythian victories\r\nby the use of a similar title.--And when the Augustans offered to build a\r\nshrine to the emperor worth a thousand librae, the whole equestrian order\r\nwas compelled to help defray the expense they had undertaken.--As for the\r\ndoings of the senate, it would be a task to describe them all in detail.\r\nFor so many sacrifices and days of thanksgiving were announced that the\r\nwhole year would not hold them all.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--19--] Helius having for some time sent Nero repeated messages\r\nurging him to return as quickly as possible, when he found that no\r\nattention was paid to them, went himself to Greece on the seventh day and\r\nfrightened him by saying that a great conspiracy against him was on foot\r\nin Rome. This news made him embark at double quick rate. There was some\r\nhope of his perishing in a storm and many rejoiced, but to no purpose: he\r\ncame safely to land. And cause for destroying some few persons was found\r\nin the very fact that they had prayed and hoped that he might perish.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 68 (a.u. 821)] [Sidenote:--20--] So, when he marched into\r\nRome, a portion of the wall was torn down and a section of the gates\r\nbroken in, because some asserted that each of these ceremonies was\r\ncustomary upon the return of garlanded victors from the games. First\r\nentered men wearing the garlands which, had been won, and after them\r\nothers with boards borne aloft on spears, upon which were inscribed the\r\nname of the set of games, the kind of contest, and a statement that \"Nero\r\nCaesar first of all the Romans from the beginning of the world has\r\nconquered in it.\" Next came the victor himself on a triumphal car in which\r\nAugustus once had celebrated his many victories: he wore a vesture of\r\npurple sprinkled with gold and a garland of wild olive; he held in his\r\nhand the Pythian laurel. By his side in the vehicle sat Diodorus the\r\nCitharoedist. After passing in this manner through the hippodrome and\r\nthrough the Forum in company with the soldiers and the knights and the\r\nsenate he ascended the Capitol and proceeded thence to the palace.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 68 (a.u. 821)] The city was all decked with garlands, was\r\nablaze with lights and smoky with incense, and the whole population,--the\r\nsenators themselves most of all,--kept shouting aloud: \"Vah, Olympian\r\nVictor! Vah Pythian Victor! Augustus! Augustus! Hail to Nero the Hercules,\r\nhail to Nero the Apollo!! The one National Victor, the only one from the\r\nbeginning of time! Augustus! Augustus! O, Divine Voice! Blessed are they\r\nthat hear thee!\"--Why should I employ circumlocutions instead of letting\r\nyou see their very words? The actual expressions used do not disgrace my\r\nhistory: no, the concealment of none of them rather lends it distinction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--21--] When he had finished these ceremonies, he announced a\r\nseries of horse-races, and transferring to the hippodrome these crowns and\r\nall the rest that he had secured by victories in chariot racing, he put\r\nthem about the Egyptian obelisk. The number of them was one thousand eight\r\nhundred and eight. After doing this he appeared as charioteer.--A certain\r\nLarcius, a Lydian, approached him with an offer of twenty-five myriads if\r\nhe would play and sing for them. Nero would not take the money, disdaining\r\nto do anything for pay; and so Tigillinus collected it, as the price of\r\nnot putting Larcius to death. However, the emperor did appear on the stage\r\nwith an accompanied song and he also gave a tragedy. In the equestrian\r\ncontests he was seldom absent, and sometimes he would voluntarily let\r\nhimself be defeated in order to make it more credible that he really won\r\nat other times.\r\n\r\nDio 62nd Book: \"And he inflicted uncounted woes on many cities.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--22--] This was the kind of life Nero led, this was the way he\r\nruled. I shall narrate also how he was put down and driven from his\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\nWhile Nero was still in Greece, the Jews revolted openly and he sent\r\nVespasian against them. The inhabitants of Britain and of Gaul, likewise,\r\noppressed by the taxes, experienced an even keener distress, which added\r\nfuel to the already kindled fire of their indignation.\r\n\r\n--There was a Gaul named Gaius Julius Vindex [an Aquitanian], descended\r\nfrom the native royal race and on his father's side entitled to rank as a\r\nRoman senator. He was strong of body, had an intelligent mind, was skilled\r\nin warfare and was full of daring for every enterprise. [He was to the\r\ngreatest degree a lover of freedom and was ambitious; and he stood at the\r\nhead of the Gauls.] Now this Vindex made an assembly of the Gauls, who had\r\nsuffered much during the numerous forced levies of money, and were still\r\nsuffering at Nero's hands. And ascending a tribunal he delivered a long\r\nand detailed speech against Nero, saying that they ought to revolt from\r\nthe emperor and join him in an attack [upon him],--\"because,\" said he, \"he\r\nhas despoiled the whole Roman world, because he has destroyed all the\r\nflower of their senate, because he debauched and likewise killed his\r\nmother, and does not preserve even the semblance of sovereignty. Murders,\r\nseizures and outrages have often been committed and by many other persons:\r\nbut how may one find words to describe the remainder of his conduct as it\r\ndeserves? I have seen, my friends and allies,--believe me,--I have seen\r\nthat man (if he is a man, who married Sporus and was given in marriage to\r\nPythagoras) in the arena of the theatre and in the orchestra, sometimes\r\nwith the zither, the loose tunic, the cothurnus, [Footnote: The two kinds\r\nof footwear mentioned here appear in the Greek as _chothornos_ and\r\n_embates_ respectively. These words are often synonymous, and both\r\nmay refer, as a rule, to _high_ boots. In the present passage,\r\nhowever, some kind of contrast is evidently intended, and the most\r\nacceptable solution of the question is that given by Sturz, in his\r\nedition, who says that the _chothornos_ seems to have been used by\r\nNero only in singing, whereas he wore the _embates_ (as also the\r\nmask) while acting.] sometimes with wooden shoes [Footnote: see previous\r\nfootnote] and mask. I have often heard him sing, I have heard him make\r\nproclamations, I have heard him perform tragedy. I have seen him in\r\nchains, I have seen him dragged about, pregnant, bearing children, going\r\nthrough all the situations of mythology, by speech, by being addressed, by\r\nbeing acted upon, by acting. Who, then, will call such a person Caesar and\r\nemperor and Augustus? Let no one for any consideration so abuse those\r\nsacred titles. They were held by Augustus and by Claudius. This fellow\r\nmight most properly be termed Thyestes and Oedipus, Alcmeon and Orestes.\r\nThese are the persons he represents on the stage and it is these titles\r\nthat he has assumed rather than the others. Therefore now at length rise\r\nagainst him: come to the succor of yourselves and of the Romans; liberate\r\nthe entire world!\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--23--] Such words falling from the lips of Vindex met with\r\nentire approval from all. Vindex was not working to get the imperial\r\noffice for himself but chose Servius Sulpicius Galba for that position:\r\nthis man was distinguished for his upright behavior and knowledge of war,\r\nwas governor of Spain, and had a not inconsiderable force. He was also\r\nnominated by the soldiers as emperor.\r\n\r\nIt is stated that Nero having offered by proclamation\r\ntwo hundred and fifty myriads to the person who should kill Vindex, the\r\nlatter when he heard of it remarked: \"The person who kills Nero and brings\r\nhis head to me may take mine in return.\" That was the sort of man Vindex\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--24--] Rufus, governor of Germany, set out to make war on\r\nVindex; but when he reached Vesontio he sat down to besiege the city, for\r\nthe alleged reason that it had not received him. Vindex came against him\r\nto the aid of the city and encamped not far off. They then sent messages\r\nback and forth to each other and finally held a conference together at\r\nwhich no one else was present and made a mutual agreement,--against Nero,\r\nas it was thought. After this Vindex set his army in motion for the\r\napparent purpose of occupying the town: and the soldiers of Rufus,\r\nbecoming aware of their approach, and thinking the force was marching\r\nstraight against them, set out without being ordered to oppose their\r\nprogress. They fell upon the advancing troop while the men were off their\r\nguard and in disarray, and so cut down great numbers of them. Vindex\r\nseeing this was afflicted with so great grief that he slew himself. For he\r\nfelt, besides, at odds with Heaven itself, in that he had not been able to\r\nattain his goal in an undertaking of so great magnitude, involving the\r\noverthrow of Nero and the liberation of the Romans.\r\n\r\nThis is the truth of the matter. Many afterwards inflicted wounds on his\r\nbody, and so gave currency to the erroneous supposition that they had\r\nthemselves killed him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--25--] Rufus mourned deeply his demise, but refused to accept\r\nthe office of emperor, although his soldiers frequently obtained it. He\r\nwas an energetic man and had a large, wide-awake body of troops. His\r\nsoldiers tore down and shattered the image of Nero and called their\r\ngeneral Caesar and Augustus. When he would not heed them, one of the\r\nsoldiers thereupon quickly inscribed these words on one of his standards.\r\nHe erased the terms, however, and after a great deal of trouble brought\r\nthe men to order and persuaded them to submit the question [Footnote:\r\n[Greek: ta pragmata] supplied by Polak.] to the senate and the people. It\r\nis hard to say whether this was merely because he did not deem it right\r\nfor the soldiers to bestow the supreme authority upon any one (for he\r\ndeclared this to be the prerogative of the senate and the people), or\r\nbecause he was entirely highminded and felt no personal desire for the\r\nimperial power, to secure which others were willing to do everything.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--26--] [Nero was informed of the Vindex episode as he was in\r\nNaples viewing the gymnastic contest just after luncheon. He was naturally\r\nfar from sorry, and leaping from his seat vied in prowess with some\r\nathlete. He did not hurry back to Rome but merely sent a letter to the\r\nsenate, in which he asked them to regard leniently his non-arrival,\r\nbecause he had a sore throat, implying that when he did come he wanted to\r\nsing to them. And he continued to devote the same care and attention to\r\nhis voice, to his songs, and to the zither tunes, not only just then but\r\nalso subsequently: so he would not try a tone of his intended program. If\r\nhe was at any time compelled by circumstances to make some exclamation,\r\nyet somebody, reminding him that he was to appear as citharoedist, would\r\nstraightway check and control him.\r\n\r\nIn general he still behaved in his accustomed manner and\r\nhe was pleased with the news brought him because he had been expecting in\r\nany event to overcome Vindex and because he thought he had now secured a\r\njustifiable ground for money-getting and murders. He enjoyed the same\r\ndegree of luxury; and upon the completion and adornment of the heroum of\r\nSabina he gave it a brilliant dedication, taking care to have inscribed\r\nupon it: \"The Women have built This to Sabina, the Goddess Venus.\" And the\r\nwriting told the truth: for the building had been constructed with money\r\nof which a great part had been stolen from women. Also he had his numerous\r\nlittle jokes, of which I shall mention only one, omitting the rest.] One\r\nnight he suddenly summoned in haste the foremost senators and knights,\r\napparently to make some communication to them regarding the political\r\nsituation. When they were assembled, he said: \"I have discovered a way by\r\nwhich the water organ\"--I must write exactly what he said--\"will produce a\r\ngreater and more harmonious volume of sound.\" Such were his jokes about\r\nthis period. And little did he reck that both sets of doors, those of the\r\nmonument and those of the bedchamber of Augustus, opened of their own\r\naccord in one and the same night, or that at Albanum it rained so much\r\nblood that rivers of it flowed over the land, or that the sea retreated a\r\ngood distance from Egypt and covered a large portion of Lycia.\r\n[Sidenote:--27--] But when he heard about Galba's being proclaimed emperor\r\nby the soldiers and about the desertion of Rufus, he fell into great fear:\r\nhe made preparations in person at Rome and he sent against the rebels\r\nRubrius Gallus and some others.\r\n\r\nOn learning that Petronius, [Footnote: _P. Petronius Turpilianus_.]\r\nwhom he had sent ahead against the rebels with the larger portion of the\r\narmy, also favored the cause of Galba, Nero reposed no further hope in\r\narms.\r\n\r\nBeing abandoned by all without exception he began forming plans to kill\r\nthe senators, burn the city to the ground, and sail to Alexandria. He\r\ndropped this hint in regard to his future course: \"Even though we be\r\ndriven from our empire, yet this little artistic gift of ours shall\r\nsupport us there.\" To such a pitch of folly had he come as to believe that\r\nhe could live for a moment as a private citizen and would be able to\r\nappear as a musician.\r\n\r\nHe was on the point of putting those measures into effect when the senate\r\nfirst withdrew the guard that surrounded Nero, then entered the camp, and\r\ndeclared Nero an enemy but chose Galba in his place as emperor.\r\n\r\nBut when he perceived that he had been deserted also by his body-guards\r\n(he happened to be asleep in some garden), he undertook to make his\r\nescape. Accordingly, he assumed shabby clothing and mounted a horse no\r\nbetter than his attire. Closely veiled he rode while it was yet night\r\ntowards an estate of Phao, a Caesarian, in company with the owner of the\r\nplace, and Epaphroditus and Sporus. [Sidenote:--28--] While he was on the\r\nway an extraordinary earthquake occurred, so that one might have thought\r\nthe whole world was breaking apart and all the spirits of those murdered\r\nby him were leaping up to assail him. Being recognized, they say, in spite\r\nof his disguise by some one who met him he was saluted as emperor;\r\nconsequently he turned aside from the road and hid himself in a kind of\r\nreedy place. There he waited till daylight, lying flat on the ground so as\r\nto run the least risk of being seen. Every one who passed he suspected had\r\ncome for him; he started at every voice, thinking it to be that of some\r\none searching for him: if a dog barked anywhere or a bird chirped, or a\r\nbush or twig was shaken by the breeze, he was thrown into a violent\r\ntremor. These sounds would not let him have rest, yet he dared not speak a\r\nword to any one of those that were with him for fear some one else might\r\nhear: but he wept and bewailed his fortune, considering among other things\r\nhow he had once stood resplendent in the midst of so vast a retinue and\r\nwas now dodging from sight in company with three freedmen. Such was the\r\ndrama that Fate had now prepared for him, to the end that he should no\r\nlonger represent all other matricides and beggars, but only himself at\r\nlast. Now he repented of his haughty insolence, as if he could make one of\r\nhis acts undone. Such was the tragedy in which Nero found himself\r\ninvolved, and this verse constantly ran through his mind:\r\n\r\n  \"Both spouse and father bid me pitiably die.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a long time, as no one was seen to be searching for him, he went\r\nover into the cave, where in his hunger he ate such bread as he had never\r\nbefore tasted and in his thirst drank water such as he had never drunk\r\nbefore. This gave him such a qualm that he said: \"So this is my famous\r\nfrigid _decocta_.\" [Footnote: Reading [Greek: apepsthon] (Reimar,\r\nCobet et al)..]\r\n\r\nWhile he was in this plight the Roman people were going wild with delight\r\nand offering whole oxen in sacrifice. Some carried small liberty caps, and\r\nthey voted to Galba the rights pertaining to the imperial office. For Nero\r\nhimself they instituted a search in all directions and for some time were\r\nat a loss to know whither he could have betaken himself. When they finally\r\nlearned, they sent horsemen to dispose of him. He, then, perceiving that\r\nthey were drawing near, commanded his companions to kill him. As they\r\nrefused to obey, he uttered a groan and said: \"I alone have neither friend\r\nnor foe.\" By this time the horsemen were close at hand, and so he killed\r\nhimself, uttering that far-famed sentence: \"Jupiter, what an artist\r\nperishes in me!\" And as he lingered in his agony Epaphroditus dealt him a\r\nfinishing stroke. He had lived thirty years and nine months, out of which\r\nhe had ruled thirteen years and eight months. Of the descendants of Aeneas\r\nand of Augustus he was the last, as was plainly indicated by the fact that\r\nthe laurels planted by Livia and the breed of white chickens perished\r\nsomewhat before his death.\r\n\r\nThere was no one who might not hope to lay hands on the sovereignty in a\r\ntime of so great confusion.\r\n\r\nRufus visited Galba and could obtain from him no important privileges,\r\nunless one reckons the fact that a man who had frequently been hailed as\r\nemperor was allowed to live. Among the rest of mankind, however, he had\r\nacquired a great name, greater than if he had accepted the sovereignty,\r\nfor refusing to receive it.\r\n\r\nGalba, now that Nero had been destroyed and the senate had voted him the\r\nimperial authority and Rufus had made advances to him, plucked up courage.\r\nHowever, He did not adopt the name \"Caesar,\" until envoys of the senate\r\nhad paid him a visit. Nor had he hitherto inscribed the name \"emperor\" in\r\nany document.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIO'S ROMAN HISTORY\r\n64\r\n\r\nOmens announcing Galba's sovereignty: his avarice: the insolence of\r\nfreedmen, of Nymphidius, of Capito (chapters 1, 2).\r\n\r\nHis ferocious entrance into the city: punishment of the Neronians (chapter\r\n3).\r\n\r\nAbout the uprising of Vitellius against Galba (chapter 4).\r\n\r\nL.

(A.D. 69 = a.u. 822, to January 15th).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 68 (a.u. 821)] [Sidenote:--1--] Thus was Galba declared\r\nemperor just as Tiberius had foretold when he said to him: \"You also shall\r\nhave a little taste of sovereignty.\" The event was likewise foretold by\r\nunmistakable omens. He beheld in visions the Goddess of Fortune telling\r\nhim that she had now stuck by him for a long time yet no one appeared\r\nready to take her into his house; and if she should be barred out much\r\nlonger she should take up her abode with some one else. During those very\r\ndays also boats full of weapons and under the guidance of no human being\r\ncame to anchor off the coast of Spain. And a mule brought forth young, an\r\noccurrence which had been previously interpreted as destined to portend\r\nthe possession of authority by him. Again, a boy that was bringing him\r\nincense in the course of a sacrifice suddenly had his hair turn gray;\r\nwhereupon the seers declared that dominion over the younger generation\r\nshould be given to his old age.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--2--] These, then, were the signs given beforehand that had a\r\nbearing on his sovereignty. Personally his conduct was in most ways\r\nmoderate and he avoided giving offence since he bore in mind that he had\r\nnot taken the emperor's seat but it had been given him;--indeed, he said\r\nso frequently:--unfortunately, he collected money greedily since his wants\r\nwere numerous, though he spent comparatively little after all, bestowing\r\nupon some persons not even denarii but merely asses. His freedmen,\r\nhowever, committed a great number of wrongs, the responsibility for which\r\nwas laid upon him. Ordinary individuals need only keep themselves from\r\ncrime, but those who hold sovereign power must see to it that no dependent\r\nof theirs practices villany either. For it makes little difference to the\r\nones who suffer wrong at whose hands they happen to be ill treated.\r\nConsequently, even though Galba abstained from inflicting injury, yet he\r\nwas ill spoken of because he allowed these others to commit crimes, or at\r\nleast was ignorant of what was taking place. Nymphidius and Capito, in\r\nparticular, were allowed by him to run riot. For instance, Capito, when\r\none day some one appealed a case from his jurisdiction, changed his seat\r\nhastily to a high chair near by and then cried out: \"Now plead your case\r\nbefore Caesar!\" He went through the form of deciding it and had the man\r\nput to death. Galba felt obliged to proceed against them for this.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--3--] As he drew near the City, the guards of Nero met him and\r\nasked that their organization be preserved intact. At first he was for\r\npostponing his decision and averred that he wanted to think the matter\r\nover. Since, however, they would not obey but kept up a clamor, the army\r\nsubmitted to them. As a consequence about seven thousand of his soldiers\r\nlost their lives and the guardsmen were decimated. This shows that even if\r\nGalba was bowed down with age and disease, yet his spirit was keen and he\r\ndid not believe in an emperor's being compelled to do anything\r\nunwillingly. A further proof is that when the Pretorians asked him for the\r\nmoney which Nymphidius had promised them, he would not give it, but\r\nreplied: \"I am accustomed to levy soldiers, not to buy them.\" And when the\r\npopulace brought urgent pressure to bear on him to kill Tigillinus and\r\nsome others who had before been wantonly insolent, he would not yield,\r\nthough he would probably have disposed of them had not their enemies made\r\nthis demand. Helius, however, as well as Narcissus, Patrobius, Lucusta the\r\npoison merchant, and some others who had been active in Nero's day, he\r\nordered to be carried in chains all over the city and afterwards to\r\nreceive punishment. The slaves, likewise, who had been guilty of any act\r\nor speech detrimental to their masters were handed over to the latter for\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nSome disdained receiving their own slaves, wishing to be rid of rascally\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nGalba demanded the return of all moneys and objects of value which any\r\npersons had received from Nero. However, if anybody had been exiled by the\r\nlatter on the charge of impiety towards the emperor, he restored him to\r\ncitizenship; and he also transferred to the tomb of Augustus the bones of\r\nmembers of the imperial family who had been murdered, and he set up their\r\nimages anew.\r\n\r\nFor this he was praised. On the other hand he was the victim of uproarious\r\nlaughter for wearing a sword whenever he walked on the street, since he\r\nwas so old and weak of sinew.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 69 (a.u. 822)] [Sidenote:--4--] I shall relate also the\r\ncircumstances of his death. The soldiers in Germany under control of Rufus\r\nbecame more and more excited because they could not obtain any favors from\r\nGalba; and, having failed to secure the object of their desire through the\r\nmedium of Rufus, they sought to obtain it through somebody else. This they\r\ndid. With Aulus Vitellius, governor of Lower Germany, at their head they\r\nrevolted. All that they had in mind regarding him was the nobility of his\r\nbirth, and they paid no attention to the fact that he had been a favorite\r\nof Tiberius and was a slave to the licentious habits of his former master;\r\nor perhaps they thought that on this very account he would suit their\r\npurpose all the better. Indeed, Vitellius himself deemed himself of so\r\nlittle account that he made fun of the astrologers and used their\r\nprediction as evidence against them, saying: \"Certainly they know nothing\r\nwho declare that I shall become emperor.\" Nero when he heard it also\r\nlaughed, and felt such contempt for the fellow that he did not try to\r\ninjure him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--5--] Galba on being informed of his defection adopted Lucius\r\nPiso, a youth of good family, affable and prudent, and appointed him\r\nCaesar. At the same time Marcus Salvius Otho, angry because _he_ had\r\nnot been adopted by Galba, brought about once more a beginning of\r\ncountless evils for the Romans. He was always held in honor by Galba, so\r\nmuch so that on the day of the latter's death he was the only one of the\r\nsenators to attend him at the sacrifice. And to him most of all was the\r\ncatastrophe due. For when the diviner declared that Galba would be the\r\nvictim of conspiracy and therefore urged him by no means to go abroad\r\nanywhere, Otho heard it, and hastening down immediately as if on some\r\nother errand was admitted within the wall by some few soldiers who were in\r\nthe conspiracy with him. The next step was the winning over or rather the\r\nbuying up of the rest, who were displeased at Galba, by means of many\r\npromises. From them he received the imperial office at once and later his\r\nclaim was acknowledged by the others. [Sidenote:--6--] Galba on learning\r\nwhat was taking place thought he could bring the men into a better frame\r\nof mind and sent some emissaries to the camp for this purpose. Meanwhile a\r\nsoldier holding aloft a bare blade covered with blood had approached him\r\nand said: \"Be of good cheer, emperor: I have killed Otho, and no further\r\ndanger awaits you.\" Galba, believing this, said to him: \"And who ordered\r\nyou to do that?\" He himself started for the Capitol to offer sacrifice. As\r\nhe reached the middle of the Roman Forum, horsemen and footsoldiers met\r\nhim and then and there cut down in the presence of many senators and\r\ncrowds of plebeians the old man, their consul, high priest, Caesar,\r\nemperor. After abusing his body in many ways they cut off his head and\r\nstuck it on a pole.--So he was struck by a javelin hurled into the very\r\nchair in which he was being carried, was wounded at the very moment he was\r\nbending forward from it, and only said: \"Why, what harm have I done?\"\r\nSempronius Densus, a centurion, defended him as long as he was able, and\r\nfinally, when he could accomplish nothing, let himself be slain with his\r\nsovereign. This is why I have included his name, for he richly deserves to\r\nbe mentioned. Piso also was killed and numerous others, but not in aiding\r\nthe emperor.\r\n\r\nWhen the soldiers had done this, they cut off their heads, which they then\r\ncarried to Otho (who was in the camp) and also into the senate-house; and\r\nthe senators, though terror-stricken, affected to be glad.\r\n\r\nGalba had lived seventy-two years and twenty-three days,\r\nout of which he ruled nine months and thirteen days. Piso perished after\r\nhim, making this atonement for having been appointed Caesar.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--7--] This was the end that befell Galba. But retribution was\r\ndestined full soon enough to seek out Otho in his turn, as he at once\r\nlearned. As he was offering his first sacrifice, the omens were seen to be\r\nunfavorable, so that he repented of what had been done and said: \"What\r\nneed was there of my playing on the long flutes?\" This is a colloquial and\r\nproverbial expression that has reference to those who do anything out of\r\ntheir usual line. Later he was so disturbed in his sleep at night that he\r\nfell out of the bed and alarmed the guards who slept at the door. They\r\nrushed in and found him lying on the ground. Yet once he had entered upon\r\nthe imperial office he could not put it off; and he remained in it and\r\npaid the penalty, in spite of many temperate acts intended to conciliate\r\npeople. It was not particularly his nature to behave that way, but since\r\non account of Vitellius his prospects were in a somewhat precarious state,\r\nhe did not wish to alienate the bulk of the population.\r\n\r\nJust at this time, to be sure, he annulled the sentences against some\r\nsenators and granted various slight favors to others. By way of gaining\r\nthe public approval he constantly frequented the theatres: he bestowed\r\ncitizenship upon foreigners and made many other attractive announcements.\r\nYet he did not succeed in winning the attachment of any one save a certain\r\nfew, like himself. [For his restoration of the images of those under\r\naccusation and] his life and habits, his keeping Sporus as a companion and\r\nemploying the rest of the Neronians, alarmed everybody.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--8--] Moreover, the senate voted him all the privileges\r\npertaining to his office. He said that he had been forced to do as he did,\r\nhad been brought within the walls against his will, and had actually\r\nrisked his life after that by opposing the scheme. He regularly talked in\r\na considerate manner and assumed a kindly expression and attitude; he\r\nthrew kisses on his fingers to everybody and made many promises. But the\r\nfact did not escape men that his rule was sure to be more licentious and\r\noppressive than Nero's. (Indeed, he had immediately applied to himself the\r\nlatter's name).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--9--] They hated him most of all, however, because he had\r\ndemonstrated the fact that the imperial office was for sale and had put\r\nthe city in the power of the boldest spirits; likewise because he held the\r\nsenate and the people in slight esteem and had impressed upon the soldiers\r\nalso this idea,--that they could kill or again create a Caesar. Moreover,\r\nhe had brought the soldiers into such a daring and lawless condition by\r\nhis gifts and his immoderate attentions that one day they forced an\r\nentrance just as they were into the palace while a number of the senators\r\nwere dining there with Otho. before departing they rushed into the\r\nbanquet-room itself, killing those that strove to bar their progress. And\r\nthey would have slaughtered everybody found there had not the guests\r\njumped up and hid themselves prior to their irruption. For this behavior\r\nthe men received money, it being assumed that their act was due to their\r\nliking for Otho.\r\n\r\nAbout this time also a man was caught pretending to be Nero. His name was\r\nunknown to Dio. And at last he paid the penalty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--10--] Otho, not succeeding by frequent invitations in\r\npersuading Vitellius to come and share the imperial office, eventually\r\nplunged into open war against him. And he sent soldiers whom he put in\r\ncharge of several different leaders; this fact was largely responsible for\r\nhis reverses.\r\n\r\nValens was so eager for money and gathered it so assiduously from every\r\nsource that he put to death the decurion, who had concealed him and had\r\nsaved his life, on account of a thousand denarii which he thought had been\r\npurloined from his possessions.\r\n\r\nOtho declined battle, saying that he could not see a battle fought between\r\nkindred, just as if he had become emperor in some legitimate fashion and\r\nhad not killed the consuls and the Caesar [Footnote: Piso and Galba are\r\nmeant.] and the emperor [Footnote: Piso and Galba are meant.] in Rome\r\nitself. There fell in the battles which took place near Cremona four\r\nmyriads of men on both sides. Here, they say, various omens appeared\r\nbefore the battle, most noteworthy being an unusual bird, such as men had\r\nnever before beheld, that was seen for a number of days.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--11--] After the forces of Otho had been worsted, a certain\r\nhorseman brought word of the disaster to Otho. When the bystanders refused\r\nto credit his report--it chanced that there were many gathered there--and\r\nsome set to calling him \"renegade\" and others \"enemy,\" he exclaimed:\r\n\"Would that this news were false, Caesar: for most gladly would I have\r\ndied to secure thy victory. As it is, my demise is determined, that no one\r\nmay think I fled hither to secure my own safety. But do thou be assured\r\nthat the enemy will ere long arrive, and debate what must be done.\" Having\r\nfinished these words, he despatched himself. [Sidenote:--12--] This act\r\ncaused all to believe him, and they were ready to renew the conflict.\r\nThose present formed a numerous body and there were not a few others at\r\nhand from Pannonia. But the most important consideration, as usual in such\r\ncases, was that they loved Otho and were quite devoted to him, not in word\r\nbut in their hearts. When, however, they besought him not to abandon\r\neither himself or them, he waited until the rest, at report of the news,\r\nhad come running together, and then, after some muttered words to himself,\r\nhe delivered to the soldiers a speech, from which the following is a brief\r\nexcerpt:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--13--] \"Enough, quite enough, has already been done. I hate a\r\ncivil war, even though I conquer: and I love all Romans, even though they\r\ndo not side with me. Let Vitellius be victor, since this has pleased the\r\ngods; and let the lives of his soldiers also be spared, since this pleases\r\nme. It is far better and more just that one should perish for all, rather\r\nthan many for one, and that I should refuse on account of one single man\r\nto embroil the Roman people and cause so great a mass of human beings to\r\nperish. I certainly should prefer to be a Mucius, a Decius, a Curtius, a\r\nRegulus, rather than a Marius, a Cinna, or a Sulla,--not to mention other\r\nnames. Therefore do not force me to become one of these men I hate, nor\r\ngrudge me the privilege of imitating one of those whom I commend. Do you\r\ndepart to meet the conqueror and do him reverence. As for me, I shall find\r\nmeans to free myself, that all men may be taught by the event that you\r\nhave chosen such an emperor as has not given you up to save himself but\r\nhimself to save you.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--14--] Of this nature were the words of Otho. Falling upon the\r\nears of the soldiers they aroused both admiration of the man and pity for\r\nwhat might befall him: his troops shed tears of lamentation and mourning,\r\ncalling him father and terming him dearer than children and parents.\r\n[\"Upon thee our lives depend,\" they said, \"and for thee we will all die.\"]\r\nThis argument continued so for most of the day, Otho begging to be allowed\r\nto die and the soldiers refusing to permit him to carry out his wish.\r\nFinally, he reduced them to silence and said: \"It can not be that I should\r\nshow myself inferior to this soldier, whom you have seen kill himself for\r\nthe single reason that he had borne news of defeat to his own emperor. I\r\nshall certainly follow in his footsteps, that I may cease to see or hear\r\naught any longer. And you, if you love me in reality, let me die as I\r\ndesire and do not compel me to live against my will, but take your way to\r\nthe victor and gain his good graces.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--15--] At the close of this speech he retired into his\r\napartments and after sending some messages to his intimate friends and\r\nsome to Vitellius in their behalf he burned all the letters which anybody\r\nhad written to him containing hostile statements about Vitellius, not\r\nwanting them to serve as damaging evidence against anybody. Then he called\r\neach one of the persons that were at hand, greeted them, and gave them\r\nmoney. Meantime there was a disturbance made by the soldiers, so that he\r\nwas obliged to go out and quiet them, and he did not come back until he\r\nhad sent them to a place of safety, some here, some there. So then, when\r\nquiet had been permanently restored, taking a short sword he killed\r\nhimself. The grief-stricken soldiery took up his body and buried it, and\r\nsome slew themselves upon his grave. This was the end that befell Otho,\r\nafter he had lived thirty-seven years lacking eleven days and had reigned\r\nninety days, and it overshadowed the impiety and wickedness of his active\r\ncareer. In life the basest of men he died most nobly. He had seized the\r\nempire by the most villainous trick, but took leave of it most creditably.\r\n\r\nA series of brawls among the soldiers immediately ensued, and a number of\r\nthem were slain by one another; afterwards they reached an agreement and\r\nset out to meet the victorious party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIO'S ROMAN HISTORY\r\n65\r\n\r\nVitellius is proclaimed emperor: feasts his eyes on gladiators and\r\nslaughters: drives astrologers from Italy (chapter 1).\r\n\r\nVitellius's excess in banquets, in his home, in furniture, in his almost\r\nabsurd magnificence (chapters 2-5).\r\n\r\nPraiseworthy points in his character (chapters 6, 7).\r\n\r\nPortents of ill omen: the soldiers declare Vespasian emperor (chapter 8).\r\n\r\nMucianus is sent by Vespasian against Vitellius: Primus of his own accord\r\ntakes the lead against Vitellius (chapter 9).\r\n\r\nAlienus, put in charge of the war by Vitellius, is the author of a\r\ndesertion, but is in turn seized by his followers, who change their minds\r\n(chapter 10).\r\n\r\nThe adherents of Vitellius are conquered in battle (chapters 11-14).\r\n\r\nCatastrophe befalls the dwellers in Cremona (chapter 15).\r\n\r\nWavering on the part of Vitellius: the Capitol is burned in the course of\r\na siege by Sabinus (chapters 16, 17).\r\n\r\nDisaster to the city of Rome, taken by Vespasian's captains (chapters 18,\r\n19).\r\n\r\nHow Vitellius was taken and perished (chapters 20, 21).\r\n\r\nHow a brother and son of Vitellius met their fate (chapter 22).\r\n\r\n\r\nDURATION OF TIME.\r\n\r\n(Galba (II) and T. Vinius Coss.): A.D. 69 = a.u. 822, from January 15th.\r\nThe following _Consules Suffecti_ took office:\r\n\r\nOn the Calends of March--T. Virginius Rufus, Vopiscus Pompeius.\r\n\r\nOn the Calends of May--Caelius Sabinus, T. Flavins Sabinus.\r\n\r\nOn the Calends of July--T. Arrius Antoninus, P.

Quintius Atticus.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 69 (a.u. 822)] [Sidenote:--1--] The population of Rome\r\nwhen it heard of the downfall of Otho naturally transferred its allegiance\r\nimmediately. Otho, whom people previously praised and for whose victory\r\nthey prayed, they now abused as an enemy, and Vitellius, upon whom they\r\nhad been invoking curses, they praised and declared emperor. So truly\r\nthere is nothing constant in human affairs. Those who flourish most and\r\nthose who are lowliest alike choose unstable standards, and construct\r\ntheir praises and their censures, their honors and their degradations to\r\nconform to the accidents of their situation.\r\n\r\nNews of the death of Otho was brought to him [Vitellius] while in Gaul.\r\nThere he was joined by his wife and child, whom he placed on a platform\r\nand saluted as Germanicus and imperator, though the boy was only six years\r\nold.\r\n\r\n[Vitellius witnessed gladiatorial combats at Lugdunum and again at\r\nCremona, as if the crowds of men who had perished in the battles and were\r\neven then exposed unburied to the elements did not suffice. He beheld the\r\nslain with his own eyes, for he traversed all the ground where they lay\r\nand gloated over the spectacle as if he were still in the moment of\r\nvictory; and not even after that did he order them to be buried.] Upon\r\nreaching Rome and adjusting affairs to suit him, he issued a bulletin\r\nbanishing the astrologers and commanding them by this particular day\r\n(mentioning a given date) to leave the whole country of Italy. They by\r\nnight put up in turn another document, in which they announced that he\r\nshould lose his life by the day on which he actually died. So accurate was\r\ntheir previous knowledge of what should come to pass.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--2--] Vitellius was fond of luxury and licentiousness and cared\r\nfor nothing else human or divine. He had always been the kind of man that\r\nwould spend his time in taverns and gaming houses, over dancers and\r\ncharioteers. Incalculable were the sums he spent on such pursuits, and the\r\nconsequence was that he had many creditors. Now, when he attained to so\r\ngreat authority, his wantonness only increased, and his expenditures went\r\non most of the day and night alike. He was insatiate in filling himself,\r\nyet kept constantly vomiting what he ate, apparently living on the mere\r\npassage of food. Yet that was what enabled him to hold out; for his fellow\r\nbanqueters fared very badly. [He was always inviting numbers of the\r\nforemost men to his table and he was frequently entertained at their\r\nhouses.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--3--] On this point one of them, Vibius Crispus, [Footnote:\r\n_Q. Vibius Crispus._] was the author of a most witty remark. Having been\r\ncompelled for some days by sickness to absent himself from the convivial\r\nboard, he said: \"If I had not fallen ill, I should certainly have died.\"\r\nThe entire period of his reign consisted in nothing but carousals and\r\nrevels. All the most valuable food products were brought together from the\r\nocean itself (not to go farther) from the earth and from the\r\nMediterranean, and were prepared in so costly a fashion that even now some\r\ncakes and other dishes are named Vitellian, after him. Why should one go\r\ninto the details of these affairs? It is admitted by quite everybody that\r\nduring the period of his reign he expended on dinners two hundred million\r\ntwo thousand five hundred denarii. There came very near being a famine in\r\nall costly articles of food, yet it was imperative that they should be\r\nprovided. Once he had a dish made that cost twenty-five myriads, into\r\nwhich he put a mixture of tongues and brains and livers of fish and\r\ncertain kinds of birds. As it was impossible to make so large a vessel of\r\npottery, it was made of silver and remained extant for some time, regarded\r\nsomewhat in the light of a votive offering, until Hadrian finally set eyes\r\non it and had it melted down.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--4--] Since I have mentioned this fact, I will also add\r\nanother, namely that not even Nero's Golden House would satisfy Vitellius.\r\nHe delighted in and commended the name and the life and all the practices\r\nof its former owner, yet he found fault with the structure itself, saying\r\nthat it had been badly built and was scantily and meanly equipped. When he\r\nfell ill one time he looked about for a room to afford him an abode; so\r\nlittle did even Nero's surroundings satisfy him. His wife Galeria\r\nridiculed the small amount of decoration found in the royal apartments.\r\nThis pair, as they spent other people's money, never stopped to count the\r\ncost of anything; but those who invited them to meals found themselves in\r\ngreat trouble [save a few whom he compensated for it]. Yet the same\r\npersons would not regularly entertain him the entire day, but one set of\r\nmen furnished breakfast, another lunch, another dinner, and still another\r\ncertain viands for dessert calculated to stimulate a jaded appetite.\r\n[Footnote: This little phrase is taken direct from Plato's\r\n_Critias_, 115 B.] [For all who were able were eager to entertain him.]\r\nIt is said that after the elapse of a few days he spent a hundred myriads\r\nupon a dinner. [His birthday celebration lasted over two days and numbers\r\nof beasts and of men were slain.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--6--] [Though his life was of this kind he was not entirely\r\nwithout good deeds. For example, he retained the coinage minted under Nero\r\nand Galba and Otho, evincing no displeasure at their images; and whatever\r\ngifts had been bestowed upon any persons he held to be valid and deprived\r\nno one of any such possession. He did not collect any sums still owing of\r\nformer public contributions, and he confiscated no one's property. A very\r\nfew of those who sided with Otho he put to death but did not withhold even\r\nthe property of these from their relatives. Upon the kinsmen of those\r\npreviously executed he bestowed all the funds that were found in the\r\npublic treasury. He did not obstruct the execution of the wills of such as\r\nhad fought against him and had fallen in the battles. Furthermore he\r\nforbade the senators and the knights to fight as gladiators or to appear\r\nin any spectacle in the orchestra. And for these measures he was\r\ncommended.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--7--] He was a constant attendant of the theatres, and this won\r\nthe attachment of the populace. He ate with the most influential men on\r\nfree and easy terms, and this gained their favor to an even greater\r\ndegree. His old companions he never failed to remember and honored them\r\ngreatly, not (like some others) disdaining to appear to recognize any of\r\nthem. Many persons have unexpectedly attained to great power feel hate for\r\nthose who are acquainted with their former humble state. [Vitellius, when\r\nPriscus opposed him in the senate and denounced one of the soldiers,\r\ncalled the tribunes to his side as if he had some need of their\r\nassistance. He did not himself do Priscus any harm and did not allow the\r\nofficials to hurt him, but merely said: \"Be not indignant, Conscript\r\nFathers, that we two out of your number have had a little dispute with\r\neach other.\" This act seemed to have been due to a kindly disposition. The\r\nfact, however, that he wished to imitate Nero and offered sacrifices to\r\nhis Manes, and that he spent so great sums on dinners, though it caused\r\njoy to some, made the sensible grieve, since they were fully aware that\r\nnot all the money in the whole world would be sufficient for him.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--8--] While he was behaving in this way, evil omens occurred. A\r\ncomet star was seen, and the moon contrary to precedent appeared to have\r\nhad two eclipses, being obscured by shadows on the fourth and on the\r\nseventh day. Also people saw two suns at once, one in the west weak and\r\npale, and one in the east brilliant and powerful. On the Capitol many huge\r\nfootprints were seen, presumably of some spirits that had descended that\r\nhill. The soldiers who had slept there the night in question said that the\r\ntemple of Jupiter had opened of itself with great clangor and some of the\r\nguards were so terrified that they expired. At the same time that this\r\nhappened Vespasian, engaged in warfare with the Jews, [sent his son Titus\r\nto the emperor Galba to give him a message. But when Titus returned,\r\nhaving learned on the way] of the rebellion of Vitellius and of Otho, he\r\ndeliberated what ought to be done. [For Vespasian was in general not\r\nrashly inclined and he hesitated very much about involving himself in such\r\ntroublous affairs.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--9--] But people favored him greatly: his reputation won in\r\nBritain, his fame derived from the war under way, his kindheartedness and\r\nprudence, all led them to desire to have him at their head. Likewise\r\nMucianus urged him strongly, hoping that Vespasian should get the name of\r\nemperor and that he as a result of the other's good nature should enjoy an\r\nequal share of power. Vespasian's soldiers on ascertaining all these facts\r\nsurrounded his tent and hailed him as emperor. Portents and dreams\r\npointing him out as sovereign long before had also fallen to the lot of\r\nVespasian, and these will be recited in the story of his life. For the\r\ntime being he sent Mucianus to Italy against Vitellius, while he himself,\r\nafter taking a look at affairs in Syria and entrusting to others the\r\nconduct of the war against the Jews, proceeded to Egypt. There he\r\ncollected money, of which of course he needed a great deal, and grin,\r\nwhich he desired to send in as large quantities as possible to Rome. The\r\nsoldiers in Moesia, hearing how matters stood with him, would not wait for\r\nMucianus,--they had learned that he was _en route_,--and chose as\r\ntheir general Antonius Primus, [Footnote: _M. Antonius Primus._] who\r\nhad suffered sentence of exile in Nero's reign but had been restored by\r\nGalba and was commander of the legion in Pannonia. This man held supreme\r\nauthority, although not chosen by the emperor nor by the senate. So great\r\nwas the soldiers' anger at Vitellius and their zest for plunder. They were\r\ndoing this for no other purpose except to pillage Italy. And their\r\nintention was realized.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--10--] Vitellius when he heard about it remained where he was\r\nand went on with his luxurious living even to the extent of arranging\r\ngladiatorial combats. In the course of these it was proposed that Sporus\r\nportray the role of a maiden being ravished, but he would not endure the\r\nshame and committed suicide. Vitellius gave the charge of the war to\r\nAlienus [Footnote: _A. Caevina Alienus._] and certain others. Alienus\r\nreached Cremona and occupied the town, but seeing that his own soldiers\r\nwere out of training as a result of their luxurious life in Rome and\r\nimpaired by lack of practice, whereas the others were physically well\r\nexercised and stout of heart, he was afraid. Subsequently, when friendly\r\nproposals came to him from Primus, he called the soldiers together and by\r\nindicating the weakness of Vitellius and the strength of Vespasian\r\ntogether with the character of the two men he persuaded them to revolt.\r\nThen they removed the images of Vitellius from their standards and took an\r\noath that they would be governed by Vespasian. But, after the meeting had\r\nbroken up and they had retired to their tents, they changed their minds\r\nand suddenly gathering excitedly in force with great outcry they again\r\nsaluted Vitellius as emperor and imprisoned Alienus for having betrayed\r\nthem, and they paid no heed to his consular office. Such are the regular\r\npractices of civil wars.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--11--] The great confusion which under these conditions\r\nprevailed in the camp of Vitellius was increased that night by an eclipse\r\nof the moon. It was not so much its being obscured (though even such\r\nphenomena cause fear to men in excitement) as the fact that the luminary\r\nappeared both blood-colored and black and reflected still other terrifying\r\nshades. Not for this, however, would the men change their attitude or\r\nyield: but when they encountered each other they contended most\r\nvigorously, although, as I said, the Vitellians were leaderless; for\r\nAlienus had been imprisoned at Cremona.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, when Primus through messengers tried to induce them\r\nto come to terms, the soldiers of Vitellius sent a return message to him\r\nurging that he espouse the cause of Vitellius. When, moreover, they joined\r\nbattle with his soldiers they contended most vigorously. The battle was\r\nnot the result of any concerted plan. Some few horsemen, as often happens\r\nwhen two forces are encamped opposite each other, were out foraging in\r\nfront of the others and suddenly made an attack. After that reinforcements\r\ncame from both armies to each of the two parties in whatever order the\r\ntroops happened to become aware of the situation,--first to one side, then\r\nto the other, now of one kind of fighting force, now of another, infantry\r\nor cavalry: and the conflict was marked by vicissitudes until all had\r\nhastened to the front. Then they got into some kind of regular formation\r\nand carried on the struggle with some order even though leaderless.\r\nAlienus, as you remember, had been imprisoned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--12--] From this point on the battle between them was a well\r\nmatched and evenly balanced affair, not only during the day but at night\r\nas well. For the coming of night did not separate them. They were\r\nthoroughly angry and determined, although they were acquainted with each\r\nother and talked back and forth. Hence not hunger nor fatigue nor cold nor\r\ndarkness nor wounds nor deaths nor the remains of men that fell on this\r\nfield before [nor the memory of the disaster nor the number of those that\r\nperished to no purpose] mitigated their fierceness. Such was the madness\r\nthat possessed both sides alike [and so eager were they, incited by the\r\nvery memories of the spot, which made one party resolved to conquer this\r\ntime also, and the other not to be conquered this time either. So they\r\nfought as against foreigners instead of kindred, and as if all on both\r\nsides were absolutely obliged either to perish at once or thereafter to be\r\nslaves. Therefore, not even when night came on, as I stated, would they\r\nyield; but though tired out and for that reason often resting and\r\nindulging in conversation together, they nevertheless continued to\r\nstruggle]. As often as the moon shone out (it was constantly being\r\nconcealed by [numerous] clouds [of all shapes that kept passing in front\r\nof it]), one might see them sometimes fighting, sometimes\r\n[Sidenote:--13--] standing and leaning on their spears, sometimes sitting\r\ndown. Now and then they would shout in unison on one side the name of\r\nVespasian and on the other that of Vitellius, and again they would\r\nchallenge each other with abuse and praise of the two men. At intervals\r\none soldier would have a private chat with an opponent:--\"Comrade,\r\nfellow-citizen, what are we doing? Why are we fighting? Come over to my\r\nside.\" \"Oh, no, you come to my side.\" But what is there surprising about\r\nthis, considering that when the women of the city in the course of the\r\nnight brought food and drink to give to the soldiers of Vitellius, the\r\nlatter after eating and drinking themselves passed the supplies on to\r\ntheir antagonists? One of them would call out the name of his adversary\r\n(for they practically all knew one another and were well acquainted) and\r\nwould say: \"Comrade, take and eat this. I give you not a sword, but bread.\r\nTake and drink: I hold toward you not a shield but a cup. For whether you\r\nkill me or I you, this will afford us a more comfortable leave-taking, and\r\nwill save from feebleness and weakness the hand with which either you cut\r\nme down or I you. These are the consecrated offerings that Vitellius and\r\nVespasian give us while we are yet alive, that they may sacrifice us to\r\nthe corpses of the past.\" That would be the style of their conversation,\r\nafter which they would rest a while, eat a bit, and then renew the battle.\r\nSoon they would stop again, and then once more join in conflict.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--14--] It went on this way the whole night through till dawn\r\nbroke. At that time two men of the Vespasian party wrought a notable\r\nachievement. Their side was being severely damaged by an engine of some\r\nsort, and these two, seizing shields from among the spoils of the\r\nVitellian faction, mingled with the opposing ranks, and made their way to\r\nthe engine without its being noticed that they did not belong to that\r\nside. Thus they managed to cut the ropes of the affair, so that not\r\nanother missile could be discharged from it. As the sun was rising the\r\nsoldiers of the third legion, called the Gallic, that wintered in Syria\r\nbut was now by chance in the party of Vespasian, suddenly according to\r\ncustom saluted the Sun God. The followers of Vitellius, suspecting that\r\nMucianus had arrived, underwent a revulsion of feeling, and panic-stricken\r\nat the shout took to flight. (Another instance of how the smallest things\r\ncan produce great alarm in men who are completely tired out). They retired\r\nwithin the wall, from which they stretched forth their hands and made\r\nsupplications. As no one listened to them, they released the consul, and,\r\nhaving arrayed him in his robe of office with the fasces, then sent him as\r\nan intercessor. Thus they obtained a truce, for Alienus because of his\r\nrank and the way he had been treated easily persuaded Primus to accept\r\ntheir submission.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--15--] When, however, the gates were opened and an amnesty had\r\nbeen declared for all, suddenly soldiers came rushing in from all\r\ndirections and began plundering and setting fire to everything. This\r\ncatastrophe proved to be one of the greatest recorded. The city was\r\ndistinguished for the size and beauty of its buildings, and great sums of\r\nmoney belonging to natives and to strangers had been accumulated there.\r\nThe larger portion of the harm was done by the Vitellians, since they knew\r\nexactly which were the houses of the richest men and all about the\r\nentrances on the alleys. They showed no scruples about destroying the\r\npersons in whose behalf they had fought, but dealt blows, committed\r\nmurder, and acted as if it were they who had been wronged and had\r\nconquered. Thus, counting those that fell in battle, five myriads perished\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--16--] Vitellius, on learning of the defeat, was for a time\r\nquite disturbed. Omens had contributed to make him uneasy. He had been\r\noffering a certain sacrifice, and after it was addressing the soldiers,\r\nwhen a lot of vultures swooped down, scattered the sacred meats, and\r\nnearly knocked him from the platform. Accordingly, the news of the defeat\r\ntroubled him still more, and he quietly sent his brother to Tarracina, a\r\nstrong city, which the latter occupied. But when the generals of Vespasian\r\napproached Rome he became alarmed and took his departure. He did nothing\r\nand formed no plan, but in a state of terror was carried back and forth on\r\nthe billows of chance. One moment he was for clinging to the sovereignty\r\nand he was making definite preparations for warfare: the next he was quite\r\nwilling to give it up and was definitely getting ready to live as a\r\nprivate person. At times he wore the purple chlamys and girded on a sword:\r\nagain he assumed dark colored clothing. His public addresses both in the\r\npalace and in the Forum were now of one tenor, now of another, first\r\nurging battle and next terms of peace. At times he was inclined to\r\nsurrender himself for the public welfare, and later he would clasp his\r\nchild in his arms, kiss him, and hold him out to the people as if to\r\narouse their pity. Similarly he would dismiss the Pretorians and then send\r\nfor them again, would leave the palace to retire to his brother's house\r\nand then return: in this way he dulled the enthusiasm of almost everybody\r\ninterested in him. Seeing him dashing hither and thither so frenziedly\r\nthey ceased to carry out commands with their usual diligence, and began to\r\nconsider their own interests as well as his. They ridiculed him a great\r\ndeal, especially when in the assemblies he proffered his sword to the\r\nconsuls and to the senators present as if to show that by this act he had\r\ndivested himself of the imperial office. No one of the above persons dared\r\nto take it, and the bystanders jeered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--17--] In view of these conditions, when Primus at last drew\r\nnear, the consuls, Gaius Quintius Atticus and Gnaeus Caecilius Simplex,\r\ntogether with Sabinus (a relative of Vespasian) and the other foremost men\r\nheld a consultation, the result of which was that they set out for the\r\npalace in company with the soldiers that favored their cause, intending to\r\neither persuade or force Vitellius to resign his position as emperor. They\r\nencountered, however, the Celtae who were guarding him, and getting\r\ndecidedly the worst of the encounter they fled to the Capitol. Arrived\r\nthere they sent for Domitian, son of Vespasian, and his relatives, and put\r\nthemselves in a state of defence. The following day, when their\r\nadversaries assailed them, they managed for a time to repulse them; but\r\nwhen the environs of the Capitol were set on fire, its defenders were\r\nbeaten back by the flame. In this way the soldiers of Vitellius forced\r\ntheir way up, slaughtered many of the resisting party, and after\r\nplundering the whole stock of votive offerings burned down with other\r\nstructures the great temple. Sabinus and Atticus they arrested and sent\r\nthem to Vitellius. Domitian and the junior Sabinus had made their escape\r\nfrom the Capitol at the first noise of conflict and by concealing\r\nthemselves in houses had succeeded in eluding observation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--18--] Those soldiers of Vespasian that were led by Quintus\r\nPetilius Cerialis [Footnote: The epitome of Dio spells uniformly\r\n_Cerealius_.] (one of the foremost senators and a relative of Vespasian\r\nby marriage) and by Antonius Primus--for Mucianus had not yet overtaken\r\nthem--were by this time close at hand, and Vitellius fell into the depths\r\nof terror. The oncoming leaders through the medium of certain messengers\r\nand by placing their letters in coffins with dead bodies, in baskets full\r\nof fruit, or the reed traps of bird-catchers, learned all that was being\r\ndone in the city and formed their plans accordingly. Now, when they saw\r\nthe blaze rising from the Capitol as from a beacon, they made haste. The\r\nfirst of the two to approach the city with his cavalry was Cerialis, [and\r\nhe was defeated at the very entrance by being cut off with horsemen in a\r\nnarrow spot. However, he prevented any harm being done by his opponents.\r\nFor Vitellius, hoping that his proved superiority would afford him an\r\nopportunity to make terms, restrained his soldiers]. And having convened\r\nthe senate he sent envoys chosen from that body together with the vestal\r\nvirgins to Cerialis as envoys.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--19--] Since no one would listen to them and they came very\r\nnear losing their lives, the emissaries visited Primus, who was also at\r\nlast approaching; from him they secured an audience, but accomplished\r\nnothing. For at this juncture his soldiers came angrily toward him and\r\novercame with ease the guard at the Tiber bridge. (When the latter took\r\ntheir stand upon it and disputed their passage, the horsemen forded the\r\nstream and fell upon them from the rear). After this various bodies of men\r\nmade assaults at various points and committed some of the most atrocious\r\ndeeds. All the behavior for which they censured Vitellius and his\r\nfollowers, behavior which they pretended was the cause of the war between\r\nthem, they themselves repeated, slaying great numbers. Many of those\r\nkilled were struck with pieces of tiling from the roof or cut down in\r\nalleyways while jostled about by a throng of adversaries. Thus as many as\r\nfifty thousand human beings were destroyed during those days of carnage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--20--] So the city was being pillaged, and the men were some\r\nfighting, some fleeing, some actually plundering and murdering by\r\nthemselves in order that they might be taken for the invaders and so\r\npreserve their lives. Vitellius in dread put on a ragged, dirty, little\r\ntunic and concealed himself in an obscure alcove where dogs were kept,\r\nintending to run off during the night to Tarracina and join his brother.\r\nBut the soldiers found him after a short search, for he could not long be\r\nsure of remaining hid, seeing that he had been emperor. They seized him, a\r\nmass of shavings and blood--for the dogs had done him some harm\r\nalready--and stripping off his clothes they bound his hands behind his\r\nback, put a rope around his neck and dragged from the palace the Caesar\r\nwho had reveled there. Down the Sacred Way they hauled the emperor who had\r\nfrequently paraded past in his chair of state. Then they conducted the\r\nAugustus to the Forum, where he had often addressed the people. Some\r\nbuffeted him, some plucked at his beard, all ridiculed him, all insulted\r\nhim, laying especial stress in their remarks on his intemperance, since he\r\nhad an expansive paunch. [Sidenote:--21--] When in shame at this treatment\r\nhe kept his eyes lowered, the soldiers would prick him under the chin with\r\ntheir daggers, to make him look up even against his will. A certain Celt\r\nwho saw this would not endure it, but taking pity on him cried: \"I will\r\nhelp you, as well as I can alone.\" Then he wounded Vitellius and killed\r\nhimself. However, Vitellius did not die of the wound but was haled to the\r\nprison, as were also his statues, while many amusing and many disgraceful\r\nremarks were made about them. Finally, grieved to the heart at the way he\r\nhad been treated and what he was compelled to hear, he was heard to\r\nexclaim: \"Yet I was once your emperor!\" At that the soldiers flew into a\r\nrage and took him to the top of the Scalae Gemoniae, where they struck him\r\ndown. His head was cut off and carried about all over the city.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--22--] Subsequently his wife saw to his burial. He had lived\r\nfifty-four years [and eighty-nine days] and had reigned for a year lacking\r\nten days. His brother had started from Tarracina to come to his\r\nassistance, but learned while _en route_ that he was dead. He also\r\nencountered a detachment of men sent against him and made terms with them\r\non condition that his life should be spared. In spite of this he was\r\nmurdered not long afterward. The son of Vitellius, too, perished soon\r\nafter his father, notwithstanding that Vitellius had killed no relative\r\neither of Otho or of Vespasian. After all these various events had taken\r\nplace, Mucianus came up and administered necessary details in conjunction\r\nwith Domitian, whom he also presented to the soldiers and had him make a\r\nspeech, boy though he was. Each of the soldiers received twenty-five\r\ndenarii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIO'S ROMAN HISTORY\r\n66\r\n\r\nVespasian is made Emperor: is also designated as such by portents (chapter\r\n1).\r\n\r\nThe arrogance of Mucianus and Domitian (chapter 2).\r\n\r\nRevolt of the Germans (chapter 3).\r\n\r\nAbout the taking of Jerusalem by Titus (chapters 4-7).\r\n\r\nVespasian levies money in Egypt (chapter 8).\r\n\r\nHe treats the Romans considerately: drives philosophers from the capital\r\n(chapters 9-13).\r\n\r\nHe gathers money by the efforts of his concubine Caenis, as well as by his\r\nown (chapter 14).\r\n\r\nThe Temple of Peace and the Colossus are erected: Berenice is dismissed:\r\nthe Cynics are punished (chapter 15).\r\n\r\nThe punishment of Julius Sabinus: likewise of the conspirators, Alienus\r\nand Marcellus (chapter 16).\r\n\r\nHow Vespasian met his death (chapter 17).\r\n\r\nThe mildness of character of Titus Caesar Augustus (chapters 18, 19).\r\n\r\nWar in Britain, which is ascertained to be an island (chapter 20).\r\n\r\nHow Mount Vesuvius flamed forth: conflagration at Rome (chapters 21-24).\r\n\r\nSpectacles: death of Titus (chapters 25, 26).\r\n\r\n\r\nDURATION OF TIME.\r\n\r\nFl.

The consular\r\noffice was assumed by Vespasian and Titus while the former was in Egypt\r\nand the latter in Palestine. Vespasian had seen portents and dreams that\r\nlong beforehand indicated that he was destined to rule. As he was eating\r\ndinner in the country, where most of his time was spent, a cow approached\r\nhim, knelt down, and put her head beneath his feet. Another time, when he\r\nwas taking food, a dog threw a human hand under the table. And a\r\nconspicuous cypress tree, which had been uprooted and overthrown by a\r\nviolent wind, on the next day stood upright again by its own power and\r\ncontinued to flourish. From a dream he learned that when Nero Caesar\r\nshould lose a tooth, he should be emperor: and this matter of the tooth\r\nbecame a reality on the following day. Nero himself in his slumbers\r\nthought he was bringing the chariot of Jupiter to Vespasian's house. These\r\noccurrences, of course, needed interpretation. But in addition a Jew named\r\nJosephus, who had previously been disliked by him and imprisoned, gave a\r\nlaugh and said: \"You may imprison me now, but a year later when you become\r\nemperor you will release me.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--2--] Thus had Vespasian, like some others, been born for the\r\nposition. While he was as yet absent in Egypt Mucianus administered all\r\nthe details of government with the help of Domitian. Mucianus feeling that\r\nhe had himself given the sovereignty to Vespasian exulted greatly at these\r\nfacts above all,--that he was called \"brother\" by him, and that he had\r\nauthority to decide every question that he liked without the emperor's\r\nexpress approval and could issue written orders by merely adding his\r\nsuperior's name. For this purpose, too, he wore a finger ring that had\r\nbeen sent him, which was intended to impress the imperial seal upon\r\ndocuments requiring authorization. [Indeed, Domitian himself gave offices\r\nand procuratorships to many persons, appointing prefect after prefect and\r\neven consuls.] In fine, they behaved in every way so much like absolute\r\nrulers that Vespasian once sent the following message to Domitian: \"I\r\nthank you, my child, for letting me hold office and that you have not yet\r\ndethroned me.\"\r\n\r\nNow Mucianus gathered into the public treasury from every possible quarter\r\nvast sums of money, showing an entire readiness to relieve Vespasian of\r\nthe censure which such a proceeding caused. He was forever declaring that\r\nmoney was the sinews of sovereignty; and in accordance with this belief he\r\nwas constantly urging Vespasian to obtain funds from every quarter, and\r\nfor his own part he continued from the outset to collect revenue, thus\r\nproviding a large amount of money for the empire and acquiring a large\r\namount himself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--3--] In Germany various uprisings against the Romans took\r\nplace which are not worth mentioning for my purposes, but there was one\r\nincident that must cause us surprise. A certain Julius Sabinus, one of the\r\nforemost of the Lingones, collected by his own efforts a separate force\r\nand took the name of Caesar, declaring that he was a descendant of Julius\r\nCaesar. He was defeated in several engagements, whereupon he fled to a\r\nfield and plunged into a subterranean vault beneath a monument, which he\r\nfirst burned to the ground. His pursuers thought he had perished in the\r\nconflagration, but as a matter of fact he hid himself there with his wife\r\nfor nine years and had two male children by her. The troubles in Germany\r\nwere settled by Cerialis in the course of a number of battles, in one of\r\nwhich so great a multitude of Romans and barbarians both were slain that\r\nthe river flowing near by was held back by the bodies of the fallen.\r\nDomitian stood in fear of his father because of what he did and still more\r\nbecause of what he intended, for his plans were on no small scale. He\r\nhappened to be spending most of his time near the Alban Mount, devoting\r\nhimself to his passion for Domitia, the daughter of Corbulo. Her he took\r\naway from her husband, Lucius Lamia Aelianus, and at this time he had her\r\nfor one of his mistresses, but later he actually married her.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--4--] Titus, who was assigned to take charge of the war with\r\nthe Jews, [undertook to win them over by certain conferences and offers;\r\nas they would not yield, he proceeded to direct hostilities. The first\r\nbattles he fought were rather close; finally he prevailed and took up the\r\nsiege of Jerusalem. This town had three walls including that surrounding\r\nthe temple. The Romans accordingly heaped up mounds against the\r\nfortifications and brought their engines to bear: then collecting in a\r\ndense force they repulsed all sallying parties and with their slings and\r\narrows kept back all the defenders of the wall. Many persons that had been\r\nsent by some of the barbarian kings they kept prisoners. The Jews who came\r\nto the assistance of their countrymen were many of them from the immediate\r\nregion and many from kindred districts, not only in this same Roman empire\r\nbut from beyond the Euphrates, and they, too, kept directing missiles and\r\nstones with considerable force on account of the higher ground, some being\r\nflung from the hand and some hurled by means of engines. They likewise\r\nmade night and day sallies as often as occasion offered, set fire to the\r\nengines, slew numerous combatants, and by digging out under the wall took\r\naway earth from beneath the mound. As for the rams, they lassoed some of\r\nthem and broke the ends off, others they seized and pulled up with hooks,\r\nwhile by means of thick boards well fastened together and strengthened\r\nwith iron, which they let down against the face of the wall, they turned\r\naside the assaults of the remainder. The Romans' chief cause of discomfort\r\nwas the lack of water; their supply was of poor quality and had to be\r\nbrought from a distance.\r\n\r\nThe Jews found their underground passages a source of strength. They had\r\nthese affairs dug from within the city out under the walls to distant\r\npoints in the country, and going out through them they would attack\r\nparties in search of water and harass scattered detachments. Consequently\r\nTitus stopped them all up.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--5--] In the course of these operations many on both sides were\r\nwounded and killed. Titus himself was struck on the left shoulder by a\r\nstone, and as a result of this accident the arm was always weaker. After a\r\ntime the Romans managed to scale the outside circle, and, pitching their\r\ncamps between the two encompassing lines of fortification, assaulted the\r\nsecond wall. Here, however, they found the conditions confronting them to\r\nbe different. When all the inhabitants had retired behind the second wall,\r\nits defence proved an easier matter because the circuit to be guarded was\r\nso much less. Titus, accordingly, made anew a proclamation offering them\r\nimmunity. They, however, even under these circumstances held out. And the\r\ncaptives and deserters from the enemy so far as they could do so\r\nunobserved spoiled the Roman water supply and slew many men that they\r\ncould cut off from the main force, so that Titus refused to receive any of\r\nthem. Meantime some of the Romans, too, growing disheartened, as often\r\nhappens in a prolonged siege, and furthermore suspecting that the city was\r\nreally, even as report declared, impregnable, went over to the other side.\r\nThe Jews although they were short of food treated them kindly, in order to\r\nbe able to exhibit deserters to their own ranks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--6--] Though a breach in the wall was effected by engines,\r\nstill the capture did not immediately follow; the defenders killed great\r\nnumbers that tried to crowd through the opening. Next they set fire to\r\nsome of the buildings near by, expecting in this way to check the onward\r\nprogress of the Romans, even should the latter make themselves masters of\r\nthe entire circuit. In this way they damaged the wall and unintentionally\r\nburned down the barrier encompassing their sacred precinct. The entrance\r\nto the temple was now laid open to the Romans. The soldiers on account of\r\ntheir superstition would not immediately rush in, but at last, as Titus\r\nforced them, they made their way inside. Then the Jews carried on a\r\ndefence much more vigorous than before, as if they had discovered a rare\r\nand unexpected privilege in falling near the temple, while fighting to\r\nsave it. The populace was stationed in the outer court, the senators on\r\nthe steps, and the priests in the hall of worship itself. And though they\r\nwere but a handful fighting against a far superior force they were not\r\nsubdued until a section of the temple was fired. Then they went to meet\r\ndeath willingly, some letting themselves be pierced by the swords of the\r\nRomans, some slaughtering one another, others committing suicide, and\r\nothers leaping into the blaze. It looked to everybody, and most of all to\r\nthem, apparently, [that so far from being ruin, it was victory and\r\nsalvation and happiness to perish along with the temple]. [Sidenote:--7--]\r\nEven under these conditions many captives were taken, among them Bargiora,\r\n[Footnote: Properly Simon Bar-Giora (patronymic).] the commander of the\r\nenemy: he was the only one punished in the course of the triumphal\r\ncelebration.\r\n\r\nThus was Jerusalem destroyed on the very day of Saturn, which even now the\r\nJews reverence most. To commemorate the event it was ordered that the\r\nconquered, while still preserving their own ancestral customs should\r\nannually pay a tribute of two denarii to Capitoline Jupiter. As a reward\r\nfor this success both generals received the title of imperator, but\r\nneither had that of _Iudaicus_, although all the other privileges\r\n(including arches bearing trophies) that were proper after so great a\r\nvictory were voted to them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--8--] Hard upon Vespasian's entrance into Alexandria the Nile\r\noverflowed, and rose in one day a palm higher than usual; indeed, such an\r\noccurrence, it was said, had taken place only once before. Vespasian\r\nhimself healed two persons who had come to him because of a vision seen in\r\ndreams. One of them, who had a weak hand, he cured by treading upon that\r\nmember, and the other one, who was blind, by spitting upon his eyes. His\r\ndivine power herein shown gave him great repute, yet the Alexandrians, far\r\nfrom enjoying his society, detested him heartily; not only in private but\r\nin public they were forever making fun of and abusing him. They had\r\nexpected to receive some great reward from him because they had taken the\r\nfirst steps in making him emperor, but instead of securing anything they\r\nhad additional contributions levied upon them. Large were the sums he\r\ngathered from them, for he omitted not a single source of revenue, no, not\r\neven the first that might offer itself, though its character were\r\nreprehensible, but he sought money from everybody alike, of secular or\r\nreligious profession. As for taxes, he renewed many that had been\r\nabolished and increased those that were usual [and introduced still other\r\nnew ones]. And he adopted this same course later in the rest of the\r\nsubject territory, [in Italy] and in Rome itself. Hence the Alexandrians\r\n[both for the reasons mentioned and because most of the royal possessions\r\nhad been sold were vexed and] threw out various derogatory remarks about\r\nhim, one of them being: \"You want six obols more.\" Vespasian,\r\nconsequently, although the most affable of men, became indignant and gave\r\norders that the six obols per man should be levied, and thought seriously\r\nabout taking vengeance upon them. [The words themselves contained an\r\ninsult, and of their many undignified and anapaestic rhythms there was not\r\na single one but aroused his anger.] Titus, however, begged them off and\r\nVespasian accordingly spared them. Yet they would not let him alone, and\r\nin some assembly they all together shouted at Titus these very words: \"We\r\nforgive him. He doesn't understand being Caesar.\"\r\n\r\nSo they continued to be foolhardy, took their thorough fill of that\r\nlicense which is always working to their detriment, and abused the good\r\nnature of the emperor. [Sidenote:--9--] Vespasian soon ceased to notice\r\nthem. He sent a despatch to Rome rescinding the disfranchisement of such\r\npersons as had been condemned for so-called acts of maiestas by Nero and\r\nsucceeding rulers. His action included living and dead alike, and he\r\nmoreover stopped the indictments made upon such complaints.--The\r\nastrologers he banished from Rome, yet he consulted all of them who were\r\ndistinguished, and through the influence of Barbillus, a man of that\r\nprofession, allowed the Ephesians to celebrate some sacred games. This was\r\na privilege he granted to no other city.\r\n\r\nHe soon had Egypt subdued and sent from there a large supply of grain to\r\nRome. He had left his son Titus at Jerusalem to sack the town, and awaited\r\nits capture that he might return to Rome in his son's company. But, as\r\ntime dragged in the conduct of the siege, he left Titus in Palestine and\r\ntook passage himself on a merchantman; he sailed in this manner as far as\r\nLycia, and from that country partly by overland journeys and partly by\r\nseafaring he came to Brundusium.\r\n\r\nAfter this he came to Rome, meeting Mucianus and other prominent men at\r\nBrundusium and Domitian at Beneventum. In consequence of the consciousness\r\nof his own designs and of what he had already done, Domitian was ill at\r\nease, and moreover he occasionally feigned madness. He spent most of his\r\ntime on the Alban estate and did many ridiculous things, one of them being\r\nto impale flies on pencils. Even though this incident be unworthy of the\r\ndignity of history, yet because it shows his character so well and\r\nparticularly in view of the fact that he continued the same practice after\r\nhe became emperor, I have been obliged to record it. Hence that answer was\r\nnot without wit which some one made to a person who enquired what Domitian\r\nwas doing. \"He is living in retirement,\" he said, \"without so much as a\r\nfly to keep him company.\" [Sidenote:--10--] Vespasian though he humbled\r\nthis upstart's pride greeted all the rest not like an emperor but like a\r\nprivate person, for he remembered his previous experience.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Rome he bestowed gifts upon both soldiers and populace; he\r\nmade repairs in the sacred precincts and upon those public works which\r\nshowed signs of wear and tear; such as had already crumbled to decay he\r\nrestored; and when they were completed he inscribed upon them not his own\r\nname but the names of the persons who had originally reared them.\r\n\r\nHe immediately began to construct the temple on the Capitoline, being\r\nhimself the first to carry away some of the soil; and, as a matter of\r\ncourse, he urged the other most prominent men to do this same thing in\r\norder that the rest of the populace might have no excuse for shirking this\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe property of his opponents who had fallen in one conflict or another he\r\ndelivered to their children or to other kin of theirs; furthermore, he\r\ndestroyed contracts of long standing representing sums due and owing to\r\nthe public treasury.\r\n\r\nThough he invariably expended in munificent fashion all that was requisite\r\nfor the public welfare and arranged the festivals on a most sumptuous\r\nscale, his own living was very far from costly, and he sanctioned no\r\ngreater outlay than was absolutely necessary. Therefore even in the\r\ntaverns he allowed nothing cooked to be sold except pulse. Thus he made it\r\nquite plainly evident that he was amassing riches not for his own\r\nenjoyment but for the needs of the people.\r\n\r\nVespasian got laughed at every time that he would say, when spending\r\nmoney: \"I am making this outlay from my own purse.\"\r\n\r\nHe was neither of noble family nor rich.\r\n\r\nThe general routine of life that he followed was this. He lived but little\r\nin the palace, spending most of his time in the so-called Sallustian\r\nGardens. There he received anybody who desired to see him, not only\r\nsenators but people in general. With his intimate friends he would\r\nconverse also before dawn while lying in bed; others could greet him on\r\nthe streets. The doors of the royal residence were open all day long and\r\nno guard was stationed at them. He was a regular visitor in the senate,\r\nwhose members he consulted in regard to all projects, and he frequently\r\ntried cases in the Forum. Whatever measures he was prevented by old age\r\nfrom reading aloud, as well as any communications that he sent to the\r\nsenate when absent, he usually caused to be read by his sons, showing\r\nhonor by this course to the legislative body. Every day he had many of the\r\nsenators and others join him at table, and he himself often dined at the\r\nhouses of his intimate friends. [Sidenote:--11--] In general, his\r\nforethought for public interests caused him to be regarded as a real\r\nemperor. In his ordinary existence he was sociable and lived on a footing\r\nof equality with his subjects. He joked in unconventional manner and\r\nrather liked jokes upon himself. In case any anonymous documents were\r\nposted,--as happens to every emperor,--containing statements insulting to\r\nhimself, he showed no signs of disturbance but posted in turn a suitable\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nOne day Phoebus approached him to make an apology. It seemed that once,\r\nduring Nero's reign, Vespasian when in the theatre in Greece had frowned\r\nat the misconduct of the emperor (of which he was a witness), whereupon\r\nPhoebus had angrily bidden him \"Go!\" And upon Vespasian's enquiring \"Where\r\nto?\" the other had responded \"to the devil.\" [Footnote: This sentiment is\r\nexpressed in the Greek by \"to the crows.\"] Now when Phoebus apologized for\r\nthis speech the monarch did him no harm, in fact vouchsafed him no answer\r\nat all, save a curt \"Go to the devil yourself!\"--Again, when Vologaesus\r\nforwarded a letter to the emperor addressed as follows: \"Arsaces, King of\r\nKings, to Flavius Vespasian, Greeting,\" the recipient did not rebuke him\r\nbut wrote a reply couched in the same terms and added none of his imperial\r\ntitles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--12--] Helvidius Priscus, the son-in-law of Thrasea, had been\r\nbrought up in the doctrines of the Stoics and imitated Thrasea's\r\nbluntness, though there was no occasion for it. He was at this time\r\npraetor and instead of doing aught to increase the honor due to the\r\nemperor he would not cease reviling him. Therefore the tribunes once\r\narrested him and gave him in charge of their assistants, at which\r\nprocedure Vespasian was overcome by emotion and went out of the\r\nsenate-house in tears, uttering this single exclamation only: \"A son\r\nshall be my successor or no one at all.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 71 (a.u. 824)] After Jerusalem had been captured Titus\r\nreturned to Italy and celebrated a triumph, both he and his father riding\r\nin a chariot. Domitian, now in his consulship, also took part in the\r\nfestivities, mounted upon a charger. Vespasian next established in Rome\r\nteachers of both Latin and Greek learning, who drew their pay from the\r\npublic treasury.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--12--] It became strikingly clear that Vespasian hated\r\nHelvidius Priscus not so much for personal affronts or on account of the\r\nfriends that the man had abused as because he was a turbulent fellow that\r\ncultivated the favor of the rabble, was forever denouncing royalty and\r\npraising democracy. Helvidius's behavior, moreover, was consistent with\r\nhis principles; he banded various men together, as if it were the function\r\nof philosophy to insult those in power, to stir up the multitudes, to\r\noverthrow the established order of things, and to incite people to\r\nrevolution. He was a son-in-law of Thrasea and affected to emulate the\r\nlatter's conduct: his failure to do so was striking. Thrasea lived in\r\nNero's time and disliked the tyrant. Even so, however, he never spoke or\r\nbehaved toward him in any insulting way: he merely refused to share in his\r\npractices. But Helvidius had a grudge against Vespasian and would not let\r\nhim alone either in private or in public. By what he did he invited death\r\nand for his meddlesome interference he was destined ultimately to pay the\r\npenalty.\r\n\r\nMucianus desired to be honored by all and beyond all, so\r\nthat he was displeased not merely if a man insulted him but even if any\r\none failed to extol him greatly. Hence, just as he was never tired of\r\nhonoring those who assisted him to even the slightest extent, so his\r\nhatred was most cruel for all who did not so conduct themselves.\r\n\r\nMucianus made a great number of remarkable statements to Vespasian against\r\nthe Stoics, as, for instance, that they are full of empty boasting, and if\r\none of them lets his beard grow long, elevates his eyebrows, wears his\r\nfustian cape thrown carelessly back and goes barefoot, he straightway\r\npostulates wisdom, bravery, righteousness as his own. He gives himself\r\ngreat airs, even though he may not understand (as the proverb says) either\r\nletters or swimming. They view everybody with contempt and call the man of\r\ngood family a mollycoddle, the ill-born a dwarfed intellect, a handsome\r\nperson licentious, an ugly person comely, the rich man an apostle of\r\ngreed, and the poor man a servile groveler.\r\n\r\nAnd Vespasian did immediately expel from Rome all the philosophers except\r\nMusonius: Demetrius and Hostilianus he confined upon islands. Hostilianus\r\nwould not stop, to be sure,--he happened to be conversing with somebody\r\nwhen he heard about the sentence of exile against him and merely inveighed\r\nall the more strongly against monarchy,--yet he straightway withdrew.\r\nDemetrius even now would not yield, and Vespasian bade it be told him:\r\n\"You are working every way to have me kill you, but I am not slaughtering\r\nbarking dogs.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--13--] Before long many others who followed the so-called Stoic\r\nsystem made themselves prominent, among whom was Demetrius the cynic.\r\nThese men, abusing the title of philosophy, kept teaching their disciples\r\npublicly many pernicious doctrines, and in this way were gradually\r\ncorrupting [Footnote: Reading [Greek: hypodiephtheiron] (Dindorf).] some.\r\nUnder these circumstances Mucianus, influenced more by anger than by\r\nfondness for speaking, uttered many charges against them and persuaded\r\nVespasian to expel all such persons from the city.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--14--] This period saw also the demise of Vespasian's\r\nconcubine, Caenis. I have mentioned her because she was exceedingly\r\nfaithful and possessed naturally a most excellent memory. For instance,\r\nher mistress Antonia, the mother of Claudius, had had her write secretly\r\nto Tiberius about Sejanus and later had ordered the message erased, that\r\nno trace of the same might be left. Thereupon she replied: \"It is in vain,\r\nmistress, that you have issued this command. All of this and whatever else\r\nyou dictate to me I always carry with me in my soul and it can never be\r\nerased.\" This is one thing I have admired about her and a second is that\r\nVespasian should have been so much pleased with her. This fact gave her\r\nthe greatest influence, and she collected untold wealth, so that it was\r\neven thought that she obtained money by her independent efforts. She\r\nreceived vast sums from all sources and sold to some persons offices, to\r\nothers procuratorships, the command of campaigns, priesthoods, and to some\r\nactually imperial decisions. For Vespasian killed no one to get his money\r\nand took care to preserve large numbers of those who freely gave it. The\r\nperson who secured the funds was his concubine, but it was suspected that\r\nVespasian willingly allowed her to do as she did; and this belief was\r\nstrengthened by his other acts, a few of which, for the sake of\r\nillustration, I shall relate. When certain persons voted to erect to him a\r\nstatue costing twenty-five myriads, he stretched out his hand and said:\r\n\"Give me the money; this [Footnote: i.e., the hollowed hand (compare\r\nSuetonius Vespasian, chapter 23).] will serve as its pedestal.\"--And to\r\nTitus, who was angry at the tax on urinating [Footnote: This refers to\r\nconveniences in the public streets.], which was appointed along with the\r\nrest, he replied, as he picked up some gold pieces that were the product\r\nof it: \"See, my child, if they smell at all.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 75 (a.u. 828)] [Sidenote:--15--] In the sixth year of\r\nVespasian as magistrate and the fourth of Titus the precinct of Peace was\r\ndedicated and the so-called Colossus was set up on the Sacred Way. It is\r\nsaid to have been one hundred feet high, and to have had--according to one\r\naccount--the figure of Nero, according to others that of Titus. Vespasian\r\nwould often have beasts slain in the theatres. He did not particularly\r\nenjoy gladiatorial combats of men, although Titus during the youthful\r\nsports which were celebrated in his own land had once had a sham fight in\r\nheavy armor with Alienus. The Parthians, who fell into a war with some\r\npeoples, asked for an alliance with him, but he did not go to their aid,\r\nsaying that it was not proper for him to interfere in other persons'\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nBerenice was at the height of her power and consequently came to Rome\r\nalong with her brother Agrippa. [Footnote: This Agrippa, known also as\r\nHerodes II, was an intimate friend of the Jewish historian Josephus and a\r\ncompanion of Titus at the siege of Jerusalem. It was before him, moreover,\r\nthat the apostle Paul made his defence in A.D. 60.] The latter was\r\naccorded pretorial honors, while she dwelt in the Palace and cohabited\r\nwith Titus. She expected to be married to him and behaved in all respects\r\nas if his wife. But when he perceived that the Romans were displeased at\r\nthe situation he sent her away; for various reports were in circulation.\r\nAt this time, too, certain sophists of the cynic school managed somehow to\r\nslip into the city: first, Diogenes entered the theatre when it was full\r\nof men and denounced them in a long, abusive speech, for which he was\r\nflogged; after him Heras, who showed no greater disposition to be\r\nobedient, gave vent to many senseless bawlings in the true cynic\r\n(dog-like) manner,--and for this behavior was beheaded.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 79 (a.u. 832)] [Sidenote:--16--] About the same period\r\nthat these events took place it happened that at a certain inn such a\r\nquantity of overflowed the vessels that it ran out into the street.\r\nMoreover, Sabinus the Gaul, already mentioned, the person who had once\r\nnamed himself Caesar, had later taken up arms, had been defeated and had\r\nhidden himself in the monument, was discovered [Footnote: The meaning is\r\nclear. Cobet (Mnemosyne, N.S.X). thinks that ephorathae expresses the idea\r\nmore accurately than the commonly accepted ephanerothae (Boissevain also\r\nephorathae).] and brought to Rome. With him perished also his wife\r\nPeponila, who had previously saved his life. She had presented her\r\nchildren before Vespasian and had delivered a most pitiful speech in their\r\nbehalf: \"These little ones, Caesar, I both brought forth and reared in the\r\nmonument, that we might be a greater number to supplicate you.\" She caused\r\nboth him and the rest to weep; no mercy, however, was shown to the family.\r\nMeantime the emperor was also the object of a conspiracy on the part of\r\nAlienus and Marcellus, although he considered them among his best friends\r\nand bestowed honors upon them quite unstintedly. They did not succeed in\r\nkilling him, though. Upon their being detected, Alienus was slain at once,\r\nin the imperial residence itself, as he rose from a meal with his intended\r\nvictim. Titus issued this order to prevent his carrying his rebellion any\r\nfurther during the night; Alienus had already made arrangements with not a\r\nfew of the soldiers. Marcellus was brought to trial before the senate and\r\nwas condemned, whereupon he cut his own throat with a razor. Not even\r\nbenefits, it may be remarked, can subdue those who are naturally vicious,\r\nas is shown by the plotting of these men against him who had done them so\r\nmany kindnesses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--17--] It was after the episode just narrated that Vespasian\r\nfell sick, not, if the truth be known, of his ordinary gout but of fever\r\nand passed away at Aquae Cutiliae, [Footnote: These are mineral springs,\r\nchiefly sulphurous in nature, both hot and cold, situated near the town of\r\nCutiliae, famous for its pool with the \"floating island.\" Celsus (On\r\nMedicine, Book Four, chapter 5 (=12)) recommends bathing and standing in\r\nsuch cold mineral springs as those at Cutiliae in cases where a patient\r\nsuffers from inability of the stomach to assimilate food.--The town itself\r\nis between Reate and Interocrea among the Sabines. (And compare Suetonius,\r\nVespasian, chapter 24).] so-called, in Sabine territory. Some, who\r\nendeavor falsely to incriminate Titus (among them the emperor Hadrian)\r\nhave spread a report that he was poisoned at a banquet. Portents had\r\noccurred in his career indicating his approaching end, such as the comet\r\nstar which was seen for a considerable period and the opening of the\r\nmonument of Augustus of its own accord. When the sick man's physician\r\nchided him for continuing his usual course of living and attending to all\r\nthe duties that belonged to his office, he answered: \"The emperor ought to\r\ndie on his feet.\" To those who said anything to him about the comet he\r\nresponded: \"This is an omen not for me but for the Parthian king. He has\r\nflowing hair like the comet, whereas I am baldheaded.\" When he at length\r\ncame to the belief that he was to die, he said only: \"Now I shall become a\r\ngod.\" He had lived to the age of sixty-nine years and eight months. His\r\nreign lasted ten years lacking six days. Accordingly, it results that from\r\nthe death of Nero to Vespasian's becoming emperor a year and twenty-two\r\ndays elapsed. I have recorded this fact to prevent a misapprehension on\r\nthe part of any persons who might reckon the time with reference to the\r\nmen who were in power. They, however, did not legitimately succeed one\r\nanother, but each of them while his rival was alive and still ruling\r\nbelieved himself to be emperor from the moment that the thought first\r\nentered his head. One must not enumerate all the days of their reigns as\r\nif those days had followed one after another in orderly succession, but\r\nmake a single sweeping calculation with the exact time, as I have stated\r\nit, in mind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--18--] At his death Titus succeeded to the imperial power.\r\nTitus as a ruler committed no act of murder or passion, but showed himself\r\nupright, though the victim of plots, and self-controlled, though Berenice\r\ncame to Rome again. Perhaps this was because he had undergone a change.\r\n(To share a reign with somebody else is a very different thing from being\r\none's self an independent ruler. In the former case persons are heedless\r\nof the good name of the sovereignty and enjoy greedily the authority it\r\ngives them, thus doing many things that make their position the object of\r\nenvy and slander. Actual monarchs, on the other hand, knowing that\r\neverything depends on their decision, have some eye to good repute as well\r\nas to other matters. So Titus said to somebody whose society he had\r\npreviously affected: \"It is not the same thing to desire something from\r\nanother as to decide a case yourself, nor to ask something from another as\r\nit is to give it to some one yourself.\") Perhaps his satisfactory conduct\r\nwas also due to his surviving so short a time compared with most rulers,\r\nfor he was thus given little opportunity for wrongdoing. For he lived\r\nafter this only two years, two months and twenty days in addition to his\r\nthirty-nine years, five months and twenty-five days. People compare this\r\nfeature of Titus's career with the fullness of years of Augustus, and say\r\nthat the latter would never have won affection if he had lived a shorter\r\ntime, nor the former, if he had lived longer. Augustus, though at the\r\noutset he had shown himself rather harsh because of the wars and the\r\npolitical factions, was able later in the course of time to become\r\ndistinguished for his kindnesses: Titus ruled with forbearance and died at\r\nthe summit of his glory, whereas if he had enjoyed a longer life, it might\r\nhave been proved that he owes his present fame more to good fortune than\r\nto virtue.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--19--] It is worth noting that Titus during his reign put no\r\nsenator to death, nor was any one else slain by him all the time that he\r\nwas emperor. Cases involving maiestas he would never entertain himself nor\r\nallow others to entertain, for he said: \"It is impossible for me to be\r\ninsulted or outraged in any way. I do naught that deserves censure and I\r\ncare not for what is falsely reported. As for the emperors that are dead\r\nand gone, they will avenge themselves in case any one does them wrong, if\r\nin very truth they be heroes and possess some power.\"--He also made\r\nvarious arrangements to render men more secure and free from trouble. One\r\nof these was the posting of a notice confirming all gifts bestowed upon\r\nany person by the former emperors. This also enabled him to avoid the\r\nnuisance of having people petition him individually about the\r\nmatter.--Informers he banished from the city.\r\n\r\nIn money matters he was frugal and sanctioned no unnecessary expenditure,\r\nyet he did not punish any one for opposite tendencies.\r\n\r\nIn his reign also the False Nero appeared, who was an Asiatic and called\r\nhimself Terentius Maximus. He resembled Nero in form and voice: he even\r\nsang to the zither's accompaniment. He gained a few followers in Asia and\r\nin his onward progress to the Euphrates he secured a far greater number\r\nand at length sought a retreat with Artabanus, the Parthian chief, who,\r\nout of the anger that he felt toward Titus, both received the pretender\r\nand set about preparations for restoring him to Rome. (Compare John of\r\nAntioch, frag. 104 Mueller).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--20--] Meantime war had again broken out in Britain, and Gnaeus\r\nJulius Agricola overran the whole of the hostile region. He was the first\r\nof the Romans whom we know to discover that Britain was surrounded by\r\nwater. Some soldiers had rebelled and after killing centurions and a\r\nmilitary tribune had taken refuge in boats. In these they put out to sea\r\nand sailed around to the western portion of the country just as the\r\nbillows and the wind bore them. And without knowing it they came around\r\nfrom the opposite side and stopped at the camps on this side again. At\r\nthat Agricola sent others to try the voyage around Britain and learned\r\nfrom them, too, that it was an island.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these events in Britain Titus received the title of\r\nimperator for the fifteenth time. Agricola for the rest of his life lived\r\nin dishonor and even in want because he had accomplished greater things\r\nthan a mere general should. Finally he was murdered on this account by\r\nDomitian, in spite of having received triumphal honors from Titus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--21--] In Campania remarkable and frightful occurrences took\r\nplace. A great fire was suddenly created just at the end of autumn. It was\r\nthis way. The mountain Vesuvius stands over against Naples near the sea\r\nand has unquenchable springs of fire. Once it was equally high at all\r\npoints and the fire rose from the center of it. This is the only portion\r\nof it that is in a blaze, for the outside parts of the mountain remain\r\neven now unkindled. Consequently, as the latter are never burned, while\r\nthe interior is constantly growing brittle and being reduced to ashes, the\r\nsurrounding peaks retain their original height to this day, but the whole\r\nsection that is on fire, as it is consumed in the course of time, has\r\ngrown hollow from continual collapse. Thus the entire mountain, if we may\r\ncompare great things to small, resembles a hunting-theatre. The outlying\r\nheights of it support both trees and vines,--many of them,--but the crater\r\nis given over to fire and sends up smoke by day, flame by night. It looks\r\nas if quantities of incense of all sorts were being burned in it. This\r\ngoes on all the time, sometimes more, sometimes less. Often it throws up\r\nashes, when there is a general settling in the interior, or again it sends\r\nup stones when the air forces them out. It echoes and bellows, too,\r\nbecause its vents are not all together but are narrow and hidden.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--22--] Such is Vesuvius, and these phenomena regularly occur\r\nthere at least once a year. But all the other happenings that took place\r\nin former time, though they may have seemed great and unusual to those who\r\non each occasion observed them, nevertheless would be reckoned as but\r\nslight in comparison with what now occurred even though they should all be\r\nrolled into one. This was what befell. Numbers of huge men quite\r\nsurpassing any human stature,--such creatures as giants are depicted to\r\nbe,--appeared now on the mountain, now in the country surrounding it, and\r\nagain in the cities, wandering over the earth day and night and also\r\ntraversing the air. After this fearful droughts and earthquakes sudden and\r\nviolent occurred, so that all the level ground in that region undulated\r\nand the heights gave a great leap. Reverberations were frequent, some\r\nsubterranean resembling thunder and some on the surface like bellowings.\r\nThe sea joined the roar and the sky resounded with it. Then suddenly a\r\nportentous crash was heard, as if the mountains were tumbling in ruins.\r\nAnd first there were belched forth stones of huge size that rose to the\r\nvery summits before they fell; after them came a deal of fire and smoke in\r\ninexhaustible quantities so that the whole atmosphere was obscured and the\r\nwhole sun was screened from view as if in an eclipse. [Sidenote:--23--]\r\nThus night succeeded day and darkness light. Some thought the giants were\r\nrising in revolt (for even at this time many of their forms could be\r\ndiscerned in the smoke and moreover a kind of sound of trumpets was\r\nheard), while others believed that the whole world was disappearing in\r\nchaos or fire. Therefore they fled, some from the houses into the streets,\r\nothers from without into the house; in their confusion, indeed, they\r\nhastened from the sea to the land or from the land to the sea, deeming any\r\nplace at a distance from where they were safer than what was near by.\r\nWhile this was going on an inconceivable amount of ashes was blown out and\r\ncovered the land and the sea everywhere and filled all the air. It did\r\nharm of all sorts, as chance dictated, to men and places and cattle, and\r\nthe fish and the birds it utterly destroyed. Moreover, it buried two whole\r\ncities, Herculaneum and Pompeii, while the populace was seated in the\r\ntheatre. The entire amount of dust was so great that some of it reached\r\nAfrica and Syria and Egypt, and it also entered Rome, where it occupied\r\nall the air over the city and cast the sun into shadow. There, too, no\r\nlittle fear was felt for several days, since the people did not know and\r\ncould not conjecture what had happened. They like the rest thought that\r\neverything was being turned upside down, that the sun was disappearing in\r\nthe earth and the earth was bounding up to the sky. This ashes for the\r\ntime being did them no great harm: later it bred among them a terrible\r\npestilence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 80 (a.u. 833)] [Sidenote:--24--] Another fire, above\r\nground, in the following year spread over a very large portion of Rome\r\nwhile Titus was absent on business connected with the catastrophe that had\r\nbefallen in Campania. It consumed the temple of Serapis, the temple of\r\nIsis, the Saepta, the temple of Neptune, the Baths of Agrippa, the\r\nPantheon, the Diribitorium, the theatre of Balbus, the stage-building of\r\nPompey's theatre, the Octavian buildings together with their books, and\r\nthe temple of Capitoline Jupiter with its surrounding temples. Hence the\r\ndisaster seemed to be not of human but of divine contrivance. Any one can\r\nestimate from the list of buildings that I have given, how many more must\r\nhave been destroyed. Titus, accordingly, sent two exconsuls to the\r\nCampanians to supervise the founding of settlements and bestowed upon the\r\ninhabitants money that came (besides various other sources) from those\r\ncitizens that had died without heirs. As for himself, he took nothing from\r\nindividual or city or king, although many kept offering and promising him\r\nlarge sums. In spite of this, he restored everything from funds already at\r\nhand. [Sidenote:--25--] Most of his deeds had no unusual quality to mark\r\nthem, but in dedicating the hunting-theatre and the baths that bear his\r\nname he produced many remarkable spectacles. Cranes fought with one\r\nanother, and four elephants, as well as other grazing animals and wild\r\nbeasts, to the number of nine thousand, were slaughtered, and women (not\r\nof any prominence, however,) took part in despatching them. Of men several\r\nfought in single combat and several groups contended together in infantry\r\nand naval battles. For Titus filled the above mentioned theatre suddenly\r\nwith water and introduced horses and bulls and some other tractable\r\ncreatures that had been taught to behave in the liquid element precisely\r\nas upon land. He introduced also human beings on boats. These persons had\r\na sea-fight there, impersonating two parties, Corcyreans and Corinthians:\r\nothers gave the same performance outside in the grove of Gaius and Lucius,\r\na spot which Augustus had formerly excavated for this very purpose. There,\r\non the first day, a gladiatorial combat and slaughter of beasts took\r\nplace; this was done by building a structure of planks over the lake that\r\nfaced the images and placing benches round about it. On the second day\r\nthere was a horse-race, and on the third a naval battle involving three\r\nthousand men. Afterwards there was also an infantry battle. The Athenians\r\nconquered the Syracusans (these were the names that were used in the naval\r\nbattle), made a landing on the islet, and having assaulted a wall\r\nconstructed around the monument took it. These were the sights offered to\r\nspectators, and they lasted for a hundred days.\r\n\r\nTitus also contributed some things that were of practical use to the\r\npeople. He would throw down into the theatre from aloft little wooden\r\nballs that had a mark, one signifying something to eat, another clothing,\r\nanother a silver vessel, or perhaps a gold one, or again horses,\r\npack-animals, cattle, slaves. Those who snatched them had to carry them\r\nback to the dispensers of the bounty to secure the article of which the\r\nname was inscribed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 81 (a.u. 834)] [Sidenote:--26--] When he had finished this\r\nexhibition, he wept so bitterly on the last day that all the people saw\r\nhim, and after this time he performed no other great deed; but the\r\nfollowing year, in the consulship of Flavius [Footnote: L. Flavius Silva\r\nNonius Bassus.] and Pollio, [Footnote: Asinius Pollio Verrucosus.]\r\nsubsequent to the dedication of the buildings mentioned, he passed away at\r\nthe same Aquae that was the scene of his father's demise. The common\r\nreport had it that he was done to death by his brother, for he had\r\npreviously been the object of that person's plot: but some writers state\r\nthat a disease carried him off. The tradition is that, while he was still\r\nbreathing and had a possible chance of recovery, Domitian, to hasten his\r\nend, put him in a box packed with a quantity of snow, pretending that the\r\ndisease required a chill to be administered; and, before his victim was\r\ndead, he rode off to Rome, entered the camp, and received the title and\r\nauthority of emperor, having given the soldiers all that his brother had\r\nbeen wont to give them. Titus, as he expired, said: \"I have made but one\r\nerror.\" What this was he did not reveal, and no one else feels quite sure\r\nabout it. Some have conjectured one thing and some another. The prevailing\r\nimpression, according to one set of historians, is that he referred to\r\nkeeping his brother's wife, Domitia. Others (whom I am for following) say\r\nwhat he meant was that, after finding Domitian openly plotting against\r\nhim, he had not killed him, but had chosen rather himself to suffer that\r\nfate at his rival's hands and to surrender the government of Rome to a man\r\nwhose nature will be portrayed in the continuation of my narrative. Titus\r\nhad ruled for two years, two months, and twenty days, as has been\r\npreviously stated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIO'S ROMAN HISTORY\r\n67\r\n\r\nDomitian's cruel character: his hatred of his father and brother (chapters\r\n1, 2).\r\n\r\nHe puts aside Domitia: falls in love with Julia: slays the Vestals\r\n(chapter 3).\r\n\r\nThe German war (chapters 4, 5).\r\n\r\nDacian war with Decebalus (chapters 6, 7).\r\n\r\nDomitian's nocturnal spectacles and entertainments (chapters 8, 9).\r\n\r\nEvents of the Dacian war (chapter 10).\r\n\r\nAntonius, governor of Germany, rebels: many are slain (chapters 11-14).\r\n\r\nHow Domitian was killed through snares laid by certain men (chapters\r\n15-18).\r\n\r\n\r\nDURATION OF TIME.\r\n\r\nL.

Hence, from\r\nthese two characteristics, rashness on the one hand and craftiness on the\r\nother, he did much harm, falling upon some persons with the swiftness of a\r\nthunderbolt and damaging others by carefully prepared plots. The divinity\r\nthat he chiefly revered was Minerva, so that he was wont to celebrate the\r\nPanathenaea on a magnificent scale: on this occasion he had contests of\r\npoets and chroniclers and gladiators almost every year at Albanum. This\r\ndistrict, situated below the Alban Mount, from which it was named, he had\r\nset apart as a kind of acropolis. He had no genuine affection for any\r\nhuman being save a few women, but he always pretended to love the person\r\nwhom at any time he was most determined to slay. He could not be relied\r\nupon even by those who did him some favor or helped him in his most\r\nrevolting crimes, for whenever any persons furnished him with large sums\r\nof money or lodged information against numbers of men, he was sure to\r\ndestroy these benefactors, being especially careful to do so in the case\r\nof slaves who had given information against their masters. [Accordingly,\r\nsuch individuals, though, they received money and honors and offices all\r\nat once from him, lived in no greater honor and security than other men.\r\nThe very offences to which they had [Sidenote: A.D. 82 (a.u. 835)] been\r\nurged by Domitian commonly were made pretexts for their destruction, the\r\nemperor's object being to have the actual perpetrators appear solely\r\nresponsible for their wrongdoing. It was the same intention which led him\r\nonce to issue a public notice to the effect that, when an emperor does not\r\npunish informers he is the cause of the existence of such a class.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--2--] Though this was his behavior to all throughout the course\r\nof his reign, still he quite outdid himself in dealing dishonor and ruin\r\nto his father's and brother's friends. [To be sure, he himself posted a\r\nnotice that he would ratify all the gifts made to any persons by them and\r\nby other emperors. But this was mere show.] He hated them because they did\r\nnot supply all his demands, many of which were unreasonable, as also\r\nbecause they had been held in some honor. [Whatever had enjoyed their\r\naffection and the benefit of their influence beyond the ordinary he\r\nregarded as hostile to him.] Therefore, although he himself had a passion\r\nfor a eunuch named Earinus, nevertheless, because Titus had also shown\r\ngreat liking for castrated persons, he carried his desire to cast\r\nreflections on his brother's character to the extent of forbidding any one\r\nthereafter in the Roman empire to be castrated. In general, he was\r\naccustomed to say that those emperors who failed to punish large numbers\r\nof men were not good, but merely fortunate. [Personally, he paid no\r\nattention to those who praised Titus for not causing a single senator's\r\ndeath, nor did he care that the senate frequently saw fit to pass decrees\r\nthat the emperor should not be permitted to put to death any of his peers.\r\nThe emperor, as he believed, was far and away superior to them and might\r\nput any one of them out of the way either on his own responsibility or\r\nwith the consent of the rest; it was ridiculous to suppose that they could\r\noffer any opposition or refuse to condemn a man. Some would praise Titus,\r\nonly not in Domitian's hearing; for such effrontery would be deemed as\r\ngrave an offence as if they were to revile the emperor in his presence and\r\nwithin hearing: but [Lacuna] [Footnote: A gap must probably be construed\r\nhere. Bekker (followed by Dindorf) regarded it as coming after \"secretly\"\r\nand consisting of but a word or two (e.g. \"he hated them\") but Boissevain\r\nlocates it as indicated above and believes that considerably more is\r\nmissing.] because he understood that they were doing this secretly\r\n[Lacuna] Then there was another thing] that resembled play-acting.\r\nDomitian pretended that he too loved his brother and mourned him. He read,\r\nwith tears, the eulogies upon him [and hastened to have him enrolled among\r\nthe heroes], pretending just the opposite of what he really wished.\r\n(Indeed, he abolished the horse-race on Titus's birthday). People in\r\ngeneral were not safe whether they sympathized with his indignation or\r\nwith his joy. In one case they [Footnote: Reading [Greek: emellon]\r\n(Dindorf, Boissevain).] were sure to offend his feelings and in the other\r\nto let their lack of genuineness appear.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 83 (a.u. 836)] [Sidenote:--3--] His wife, Domitia, he\r\nplanned to put to death on the ground of adultery, but, having been\r\ndissuaded by Ursus, he sent her away and midway on the road murdered\r\nParis, the dancer, because of her. And many people paid honor to that spot\r\nwith flowers [Sidenote: A.D. 83 (a.u. 836)] and perfumes, he gave orders\r\nthat they, too, should be slain. After this he took into his house, quite\r\nundisguisedly, his own niece,--Julia, that is to say. [Then on petition of\r\nthe people he became reconciled, to be sure, with Domitia, but continued\r\nnone the less his relations with Julia.]\r\n\r\nHe was removing many of the foremost men on many pretexts and by means of\r\nmurders and banishments. [He also conveyed many to some out-of-the-way\r\nplace, where he got rid of them; and not a few he caused to die in some\r\nway or other by their own acts that they might seem to have suffered death\r\nby their own wish and not through outside force.] He did not spare even\r\nthe vestal virgins, but punished them on charges of their having had\r\nintercourse with men. It is further reported that since their examination\r\nwas conducted in a harsh and unfeeling manner, and many of them were\r\naccused and constantly being punished, one of the pontifices, Helvius\r\nAgrippa, could not endure it, but, horror-stricken, expired there in the\r\nsenate where he sat. [Domitian also took pride in the fact that he did not\r\nbury alive, as was the custom, the virgins he found guilty of debauchery,\r\nbut ordered them to be killed by some different way.]\r\n\r\nAfter this he set out for Gaul and plundered some of the tribes across the\r\nRhine enjoying treaty rights,--a performance which filled him with conceit\r\nas if he had achieved some great success. Presumably on account of the\r\nvictory he increased the soldiers' wages, so that whereas each had been\r\nreceiving seventy-five denarii he commanded that a hundred be given them.\r\nLater he thought better of it, but instead of diminishing the amount he\r\ncurtailed the number of men-at-arms. Both of these steps entailed great\r\ninjury to the public weal: he had made the defenders of the State too few,\r\nwhile rendering their support an item of great expense.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 84 (a.u. 837)] [Sidenote:--4--] Next he made a campaign\r\ninto Germany and returned without having seen a trace of war anywhere. And\r\nwhat need is there of mentioning the honors bestowed upon him at this\r\njuncture for his exploit or from time to time upon the other emperors who\r\nwere like him? For the object in any case was simply not to arouse the\r\nrage of those despots by letting them suspect, in consequence of the small\r\nnumber and insignificance of the rewards, that the people saw through\r\nthem. Yet Domitian had this worst quality of all, that he desired to be\r\nflattered, and was equally displeased with both sorts of men, those who\r\npaid court to him and those who did not. He disliked the former because\r\ntheir attitude seemed one of cajolery and the latter because it seemed one\r\nof contempt. Notwithstanding [he affected to take pleasure in the honorary\r\ndecrees voted him by the senate. Ursus he came near killing because he was\r\nnot pleased with his sovereign's exploits, and then, at the request of\r\nJulia, he appointed him consul.] Subsequently, being still more puffed up\r\nby his folly, he was elected consul for ten years in succession, and first\r\nand only censor for life of all private citizens and emperors: and he\r\nobtained the right to employ twenty-four lictors and the triumphal garb\r\nwhenever he entered the senate-house. He gave October a new name,\r\nDomitianum, because he had been born in that month. Among the charioteers\r\nhe instituted two more parties, calling one the Golden and the other the\r\nPurple. To the spectators he gave many objects by means of balls thrown\r\namong them; and once he gave them a banquet while they remained in their\r\nseats and at night provided for them wine that flowed out in several\r\ndifferent places. All this caused pleasure seemingly to the populace, but\r\nwas a source of ruin to the powerful. For, as he had no resources for his\r\nexpenditures, he murdered numbers of men, bringing some of them before the\r\nsenate and accusing others in their absence. Lastly, he put some out of\r\nthe way by concocting a plot and administering to them secret drugs.\r\n\r\nMany of the peoples tributary to the Romans revolted when contributions of\r\nmoney were forcibly extorted from them. The Nasamones are an instance in\r\npoint. They massacred all the collectors of the money and so thoroughly\r\ndefeated Flaccus, [Footnote: Probably _Cn. Suellius Flaccus._]\r\ngovernor of Numidia, who attacked them, that they were able to plunder his\r\ncamp. Having gorged themselves on the provisions and the wine that they\r\nfound there they fell into a slumber, and Flaccus becoming aware of this\r\nfact assailed and annihilated them all and destroyed the non-combatants.\r\nDomitian experienced a thrill of delight at the news and remarked to the\r\nsenate: \"Well, I have put a ban on the existence of the Nasamones.\"\r\n\r\nEven as early as this he was insisting upon being regarded as a god and\r\ntook a huge pleasure in being called \"master\" and \"god.\" These titles were\r\nused not merely orally but also in documents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--5--] Chariomerus, king of the Cherusci, had been driven out of\r\nhis kingdom by the Chatti on account of his friendship for the Romans. At\r\nfirst he gathered some companions and was successful in his attempt to\r\nreturn. Later he was deserted by these men for having sent hostages to the\r\nRomans and so became the suppliant of Domitian. He was not accorded an\r\nalliance but received money.\r\n\r\nIn Moesia, [Footnote: An error of the excerptor. The\r\nLygians lived north of Moesia.] the Lygians, who had been at war with some\r\nof the Suebi, sent envoys, asking Domitian for an alliance. They obtained\r\none that was strong, not in numbers, but in dignity: in other words, they\r\nwere granted only a hundred knights. The Suebi, indignant at this, added\r\nto their contingent the Iazygae and began to prepare well in advance to\r\ncross the Ister.\r\n\r\nMasyus, king of the Semnones, and Ganna, a virgin (she was priestess in\r\nCeltica after Veleda), came to Domitian and having been honored by him\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 86 (a.u. 839)] [Sidenote:--6--] The greatest war that the\r\nRomans had on their hands at this time was one against the Dacians.\r\nDecebalus was now king of the latter [since Douras, to whom the\r\nsovereignty belonged, had voluntarily withdrawn from it in favor of\r\nDecebalus, because]. He had a good comprehension of the rules of warfare\r\nand was good at putting them in practice, displayed sagacity in advancing,\r\ntook the right moment for retreating, was an expert in ambuscades, a\r\nprofessional warrior, knew how to make good use of a victory and to turn a\r\ndefeat to advantage. Hence he showed himself for a long time a worthy\r\nantagonist of the Romans.\r\n\r\nI call the people Dacians, just as they name themselves and as the Romans\r\ndo; but I am not ignorant that some of the Greeks refer to them as Getae,\r\nwhether that is the right term or not. I myself know Getae that live along\r\nthe Ister, beyond the Haemus range.\r\n\r\nDomitian made an expedition against them, to be sure but did not enter\r\ninto real conflict. [Instead, he remained in a city of Moesia, rioting, as\r\nwas his wont.] (Not only was he averse to physical labor and timorous in\r\nspirit, but also most profligate and lewd toward women and boys alike).\r\nBut he sent others to officer the war and for the most part he got the\r\nworst of it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 87(?)] Decebalus, king of the Dacians, carried on\r\nnegotiations with Domitian, promising him peace. Domitian sent against him\r\nFuscus [Footnote: _Cornelius Fuscus_, pretorian prefect.] with a\r\nlarge force. On learning of it Decebalus sent an embassy to him anew,\r\nsarcastically proposing to make peace with the emperor in case each of the\r\nRomans should choose to pay two asses as tribute to Decebalus each year;\r\nif they should not choose to do so, he affirmed that he should make war\r\nand afflict them with great ills.\r\n\r\nDio [Lacuna] 67th Book [Lacuna] \"When the soldiers making the campaign\r\nwith Fuscus asked him to lead them.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 90 (a.u. 843)] [Sidenote:--7--] Meantime he conceived a\r\nwish to take measures against the Quadi and the Marcomani because they had\r\nnot assisted him against the Dacians. So he entered Pannonia to make war\r\nupon them, and the second set of envoys that they sent in regard to peace\r\nhe killed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--8--] The same man laid the blame for his defeat, however, upon\r\nhis commanders. All the superior plans he claimed for himself, though he\r\nexecuted none of them, but for the inferior management he blamed others,\r\neven though it was through his orders that some accident had taken place.\r\nThose who succeeded incurred his hatred and those who failed his censure.\r\n\r\nDomitian, being defeated by the Marcomani, took to flight and by hastily\r\nsending messages to Decebalus, king of the Dacians, induced him to make a\r\ntruce with him. The monarch's frequent previous requests had always met\r\nwith refusal. Decebalus now accepted the arrangement, for he was indeed\r\nhard pressed, yet he did not wish personally to hold a conference with\r\nDomitian, but sent Diegis with other men to give him the arms and a few\r\ncaptives, whom he pretended were the only ones he had. When this had been\r\naccomplished, Domitian set a diadem on the head of Diegis, just as if he\r\nhad in very truth conquered and could make some one king over the Dacians.\r\nTo the soldiers he granted honors and money. Like a victor, again, he sent\r\non ahead to Rome, besides many other things, envoys from Decebalus, and\r\nsomething which he affirmed was a letter of his, though rumor declared it\r\nhad been forged. He graced the festival that followed with many articles\r\npertaining to a triumph, though they did not belong to any booty he had\r\ntaken;--quite the reverse: and besides allowing the truce he made an\r\noutlay of a great deal of money immediately and also presented to\r\nDecebalus artisans of every imaginable profession, peaceful and warlike,\r\nand promised that he would give him a great deal more. These exhibits came\r\nfrom the imperial furniture which he at all times treated as captive\r\ngoods, because he had enslaved the empire itself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 91 (a.u. 844)] So many rewards were voted\r\nhim that almost the whole world (so far as under his dominion) was filled\r\nwith his images and statues of both silver and gold. He also gave an\r\nextremely costly spectacle in regard to which we have noted nothing that\r\nwas striking for historical record, save that virgins contended in the\r\nfoot-race. After this, in the course of holding what seem to have been\r\ntriumphal celebrations, he arranged numerous contests. First of all, in\r\nthe hippodrome he had battles of infantry against infantry, and again\r\nbattles of cavalry, and next he gave a naval battle in a new place. And\r\nthere perished in it practically all the naval combatants and numbers of\r\nthe spectators. A great rain and violent storm had suddenly come up, yet\r\nhe allowed no one to leave the spectacle; indeed, though he himself\r\nchanged his clothing to a thick woolen cloak, he would not permit the\r\npeople to alter their attire. As a result, not a few fell sick and died.\r\nBy way of consoling them for this, he provided them at public expense a\r\ndinner lasting all night. Often, too, he would conduct games at night, and\r\nsometimes he would pit dwarfs [Footnote: Reading [Greek: nanous]\r\n(Dindorf)] and women against each other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--9--] So at this time he feasted the populace as described, but\r\non another occasion he entertained the foremost men of the senate and the\r\nknights in the following fashion. He prepared a room that was pitch black\r\non every side, ceiling, walls and floor, and had ready bare couches, all\r\nalike, resting on the uncovered ground; then he invited in his guests\r\nalone, at night, without their attendants. And first he set beside each of\r\nthem a slab shaped like a gravestone, bearing a person's name and also a\r\nsmall lamp, such as hangs in tombs. Next well-shaped, naked boys, likewise\r\npainted black, entered after the manner of phantoms, and, after passing\r\naround the guests in a kind of terrifying dance, took up their stations at\r\ntheir feet. After that, whatever is commonly dedicated in the course of\r\nofferings to departed spirits was set before them also, all black, and in\r\ndishes of a similar hue. Consequently, every single one of the guests\r\nfeared and trembled and every moment felt certain that he was to be slain,\r\nespecially as on the part of everybody save Domitian there was dead\r\nsilence, as if they were already in the realms of the dead, and the\r\nemperor himself limited his conversation to matters pertaining to death\r\nand slaughter. Finally he dismissed them. But he had previously removed\r\ntheir servants, who stood at the doorway, and gave them in charge of\r\nother, unknown slaves, to convey either to carriages or litters, and by\r\nthis act he filled them with far greater fear. Scarcely had each one\r\nreached home and was beginning to a certain extent to recover his spirits,\r\nwhen a message was brought him that some one was there from the Augustus.\r\nWhile they were expecting, as a result of this, that now at last they\r\nshould surely perish, one person brought in the slab, which was of silver,\r\nthen another something else, and another one of the dishes set before them\r\nat the dinner, which proved to be made of some costly material. Finally\r\ncame [Footnote: Verb supplied by Xylander.] that particular boy who had\r\nbeen each one's familiar spirit, now washed and decked out. Thus, while in\r\nterror all night long, they received their gifts.\r\n\r\nSuch was the triumph or, as the crowd said, such was the expiatory service\r\nthat Domitian celebrated for those who had died in Dacia and in Rome. Even\r\nat this time, too, he killed off some of the foremost men. And he took\r\naway the property of whoever buried the body of any one of them, because\r\nthe victim had died on ground belonging to the sovereign.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--10--] Here are some more events worth recording, that took\r\nplace in the Dacian War. Julianus, assigned by the emperor to take charge\r\nof the war, made many excellent regulations, one being his command that\r\nthe soldiers should inscribe their own names and those of the centurions\r\nupon their shields, in order that those of them who committed any\r\nparticular good or bad action might be more readily observed by him.\r\nEncountering the enemy at Tapai, [Footnote: Pape thinks that the proper\r\nLatin form of this word be _Tabae_.] he killed a very great number of\r\nthem. Among them Vezinas, who ranked next to Decebalus, since he could not\r\nget away alive, fell down purposely as if dead. In this way he escaped\r\nnotice and fled during the night. Decebalus, fearing that the Romans now\r\nthey had conquered would proceed against his residence, cut down the trees\r\nthat were on the site and attached weapons to the trunks, to the end that\r\nhis foes might think them soldiers, and so be frightened and withdraw.\r\nThis actually took place.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--11--] Antonius, a certain commander of this period in Germany,\r\nrevolted against Domitian: him Lucius Maximus overcame and overthrew. For\r\nhis victory he does not deserve any remarkable praise; [for many others\r\nhave unexpectedly won victories, and his soldiers contributed largely to\r\nhis success:] but for his burning all the documents that were found in the\r\nchests of Antonius, thus esteeming his own safety as of slight importance\r\nin comparison with having no blackmail result from them, I do not see how\r\nI may celebrate his memory as it deserves. But Domitian, as he had got a\r\npretext from that source, proceeded to a series of slaughters even without\r\nthe documents, and no one could well say how many he killed. [Indeed, he\r\ncondemned himself so for this act that, to prevent any remembrance of the\r\ndead surviving, he prohibited the inscribing of their names in the\r\nrecords. Furthermore, he did not even make any communication to the senate\r\nregarding those put out of the way, although he sent their heads as well\r\nas that of Antonius to Rome and exposed them in the Forum.] But one young\r\nman, Julius Calvaster, who had served as military tribune in the hope of\r\ngetting into the senate, was saved in a most unexpected fashion. Inasmuch\r\nas it was being proved that he had frequent meetings with Antonius alone\r\nand he had no other way to free himself from the charge of conspiracy, he\r\ndeclared that he had met him for amorous intercourse. The fact that he was\r\nof an appearance to inspire passion lent color to his statement. In this\r\nway he was acquitted.\r\n\r\nAfter just one more remark about the events of that time, I will cease.\r\nLusianus Proculus, an aged senator, who spent most of his time in the\r\ncountry, had come out with Domitian from Borne under compulsion so as to\r\navoid the appearance of deserting him when in danger and the death that\r\nmight very likely be the result of such conduct. When the news came, he\r\nsaid: \"You have conquered, emperor, as I ever prayed. Therefore, restore\r\nme to the country.\" Thereupon he left him without more ado and retired to\r\nhis farm. And after this, although he survived for a long time, he never\r\ncame near him.\r\n\r\nDuring this period some had become accustomed to smear needles with poison\r\nand then to prick with them whomsoever they would. Many persons thus\r\nattacked died without even knowing the cause, and many of the murderers\r\nwere informed against and punished. And this went on not only in Rome but\r\nover practically the entire civilized world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--12--] To Ulpius Trajan and to Acilius Glabrio, who were\r\nconsuls then, the same signs are said to have appeared. They foretold to\r\nGlabrio destruction, but to Trajan the imperial office. [Numerous wealthy\r\nmen and women both were punished for adultery, and some of the women had\r\nbeen debauched by _him_. Many more were fined or executed on other\r\ncharges.] A woman was tried and lost her life because she had stripped in\r\nfront of an image of Domitian [and another for having had dealings with\r\nastrologers]. Among the many who perished at this time was also Mettius\r\nPompusianus, whom Vespasian had refused to harm in any way after learning\r\nfrom some report that he would one day be sole ruler, but [Footnote:\r\nReading [Greek: halla](Dindorf).] rather honored, saying: \"You will\r\ncertainly remember me and will certainly honor me in return.\" But Domitian\r\nfirst exiled him to Corsica and later put him to death, one of the\r\ncomplaints being that he had the inhabited world painted on the walls of\r\nhis bedchamber and another that he had excerpted and was wont to read the\r\nspeeches of kings and other eminent men that are written in Livy. Also\r\nMaternus, a sophist, met his death because in a practice speech [Footnote:\r\nHartman (Mnemosyne, N. S. XXI, p. 395) would read [Greek: hasteion] for\r\n[Greek: haschon]. \"Maternus met his death because he had made some witty\r\nremark against tyrants.\" H. maintains that Domitian could not know what\r\nMaternus said in his closet; but to the present translator the MS.\r\ntradition seems to lend to this incident a greater homogeneousness of\r\ndetail with the preceding, and he retains it simply on that basis.] he had\r\nsaid something against tyrants. The emperor himself used to visit both\r\nthose who were to accuse and those who were to give evidence for\r\ncondemnation, and he would frame and compose everything that required to\r\nbe said. Often, too, he would talk to the prisoners alone, keeping tight\r\nhold of their chains with his hands. In the former case he would not\r\nentrust to others what was to be said, and in the latter he feared the men\r\neven in their bonds.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 93 (a.u. 846)] [Sidenote:--13--] As censor, likewise, his\r\nbehavior was noteworthy. He expelled Caecilius Rufinus from the senate\r\nbecause he danced, and restored Claudius Pacatus, though an ex-centurion,\r\nto his master because he was proved to be a slave. What came after, to be\r\nsure, can not be described in similar terms,--his deeds, that is to say,\r\nas emperor. _Then_ he killed Arulenus Rusticus for being a\r\nphilosopher and for calling Thrasea sacred, and Herennius Senecio because\r\nin his long career he had stood for no office after the quaestorship and\r\nbecause he had compiled the life of Helvidius Priscus. Many others also\r\nperished as a result of this same charge of philosophizing, and all\r\nremaining members of that profession were again driven from Rome. One\r\nJuventius Celsus, however, who had been conspicuous in conspiring with\r\ncertain persons against Domitian and had been accused of it, saved his\r\nlife in a remarkable way. When he was on the point of being condemned, he\r\nbegged that he might speak a few words with the emperor in private. Having\r\ngained the opportunity he did obeisance before him and after repeatedly\r\ncalling him \"master,\" and \"god\" (terms that were already being applied to\r\nhim by others), he said: \"I have done nothing of the sort. And if I obtain\r\na respite, I will pry into everything and both inform against and convict\r\nmany persons for you.\" He was released on these conditions, but did not\r\nreport any one; instead, by advancing different excuses at different\r\ntimes, he lived until Domitian was killed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 95 (a.u. 848)] [Sidenote:--14--] During this period the\r\nroad leading from Sinuessa to Puteoli was paved with stones. And the same\r\nyear Domitian slew among many others Flavius Clemens the consul, though he\r\nwas a cousin and had to wife Flavia Domitilla, who was also a relative of\r\nthe emperor's. [Footnote: His sister's daughter.] The complaint brought\r\nagainst them both was that of atheism, under which many others who drifted\r\ninto Jewish ways were condemned. Some of these were killed and the\r\nremainder were at least deprived of their property. Domitilla was merely\r\nbanished to Pandateria; but Glabrio, colleague of Trajan in the\r\nconsulship, after being accused on various regular stock charges, and also\r\nof fighting with wild beasts, suffered death. This ability in the arena\r\nwas the chief cause of the emperor's anger against him,--an anger prompted\r\nby jealousy. In the victim's consulship Domitian had summoned him to\r\nAlbanum to attend the so-called Juvenalia and had imposed on him the task\r\nof killing a large lion. Glabrio not only had escaped all injury but had\r\ndespatched the creature with most accurate aim.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of his cruelty the emperor was suspicious of all mankind\r\nand ceased now to put hopes of safety in either the freedmen or the\r\nprefects, whom he usually caused to be tried during their very term of\r\noffice. Moreover, Epaphroditus, who belonged to Nero, he first drove out\r\nand then slew, censuring him for not having defended Nero; his object was\r\nby the vengeance that he took in this person's case to terrify his own\r\nfreedmen long enough in advance to prevent their ever attempting a similar\r\ndeed. [Sidenote: A.D. 96 (a.u. 849)] It did him no good, however, for he\r\nbecame the object of a conspiracy in the following year and perished in\r\nthe consulship of Gaius [Footnote: An error, possibly emanating from Dio.\r\nThe man's right name is _T. Manlius Valens._] Valens (who died after\r\nholding the consular office in his ninetieth year) and of Gaius Antistius.\r\n[Sidenote:--15--] Those who attacked him and prepared the undertaking were\r\nParthenius his cubicularius (though he was the recipient of such marks of\r\nimperial favor as to be allowed to wear a sword) and Sigerus, [Footnote:\r\nProbably the person who is called Saturius in Suetonius, Domitian, chapter\r\n17.] who was also a member of the excubiae, as well as Entellus, the\r\nperson entrusted with the care of the state documents, and Stephanus, a\r\nfreedman. The plot was not unknown to Domitia, the emperor's wife, nor to\r\nthe prefect Norbanus, nor to the latter's partner in office, Petronius\r\nSecundus: at least, this is the tradition. Domitia was ever an object of\r\nthe imperial hatred and consequently stood in terror of her life; the rest\r\nno longer loved their sovereign, some of them because complaints had been\r\nlodged against them and others because they were expecting them to be\r\nlodged. For my part, I have heard also the following account,--that\r\nDomitian, having become suspicious of all these persons, conceived a\r\ndesire to kill them, and wrote their names on a two-leaved tablet of\r\nlinden wood, and put it under his pillow on the couch where he was wont to\r\nrepose; and one of the naked prattling [Footnote: Compare Book\r\nForty-eight, chapter 44.] boys, while the emperor was asleep in the\r\ndaytime, filched it away and kept it without knowing what it contained.\r\nDomitia then chanced upon it and reading what was written gave information\r\nof the matter to those involved. As a result, they changed their plans\r\nsomewhat and hastened the plot; yet they did not proceed to action until\r\nthey had determined who was to succeed to the office. Having conversed\r\nwith various persons, when they found that no one would accept it\r\n(everybody was afraid of them, thinking that they were simply testing\r\npeople's loyalty) they betook themselves to Nerva. He was of most noble\r\nbirth and most suitable character and had, besides, encountered danger\r\nthrough being slandered by astrologers [who declared that he should be\r\nsovereign.] Thus they the more easily persuaded him to be the next to\r\nreceive the power. In truth, Domitian, who conducted an investigation of\r\nthe days and the hours when the foremost men had been born, had\r\nconsequently ere this despatched not a few even of those who entertained\r\nno hopes of gaining any power. [Footnote: As the MS tradition of this\r\nsentence is corrupt, the emendations of Polak have been adopted.] And he\r\nwould have slain Nerva, had not one of the astrologers who favored the\r\nlatter declared that he would die within a few days. [Believing that this\r\nwould really prove true, he did not desire to be guilty of this additional\r\nmurder, inasmuch as Nerva in any event was to meet death so very soon.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--16--] Since no occurrence of such magnitude is without\r\nprevious indications, various unfavorable tokens appeared in his case,\r\ntoo. In a vision he himself beheld Rusticus approaching him with a sword;\r\nand he thought that Minerva, whose statue he kept in his bedchamber, had\r\nthrown away her weapons and, mounted upon a chariot drawn by black horses,\r\nwas being swallowed up in an abyss. But the feature which of all claims\r\nour wonder is connected with the name of Larginus Proculus. He had\r\npublicly foretold in Germany that the emperor should die on the day when\r\nhe actually did die, and was, therefore, sent on to Rome by the governor.\r\nBrought before Domitian he declared once more that this should be so. A\r\ndeath sentence was postponed in order that he might be put to death after\r\nthe emperor had escaped the danger. Meanwhile Domitian was slain, his life\r\nwas saved, and he received a hundred thousand denarii from Nerva. Some one\r\nelse had on a previous occasion told the ruler both when and how he should\r\nperish, and then being asked what manner of death he, the prophet, should\r\nmeet, he answered that he would be despatched by dogs. Thereupon command\r\nwas given that the fellow should be burned alive, and the fire was applied\r\nto him. But just then there was a great downpour of rain, the pyre was\r\nextinguished, and later dogs found him lying upon it with his hands bound\r\nbehind him and tore him to pieces.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--17--] I have one more astonishing fact to record, which I\r\nshall touch on after I have given the account of Domitian's end. As soon\r\nas he rose to leave the courthouse and was ready to take his afternoon\r\nnap, as was his custom, first Parthenius took the blade out of the sword,\r\nwhich always lay under his pillow, so that he should not have the use of\r\nthat. Next he sent in Stephanus, who was stronger then the rest. The\r\nlatter smote Domitian, and though it was not an opportune blow the emperor\r\nwas knocked to the ground, where he lay. Then, fearing an escape,\r\nParthenius leaped in, or, as some believe, he sent in Maximus, a freedman.\r\nThus both Domitian was murdered, and Stephanus perished likewise in a rush\r\nthat those who had not shared in the conspiracy made upon him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--18--] The matter of which I spoke, saying that it surprises me\r\nmore than anything else, is this. A certain Apollonius of Tyana on the\r\nvery day and at that very hour when Domitian was being murdered (this was\r\nlater confirmed by other events that happened in both places) climbed a\r\nlofty stone at Ephesus (or possibly some other town) and having gathered\r\nthe populace, uttered these words: \"Bravo, Stephanus! Good, Stephanus!\r\nSmite the wretch! You have struck, you have wounded, you have killed\r\nhim!!\" This is what really took place, though there should be ten thousand\r\ndoubters. Domitian had lived forty-four years, ten months, and twenty-six\r\ndays. His reign had lasted fifteen years and five days. His body was\r\nstolen away and buried by his nurse, Phyllis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIO'S ROMAN HISTORY\r\n68\r\n\r\nMost of Domitian's measures are annulled (chapter 1).\r\n\r\nThe excellencies of Nerva Augustus Caesar: his kindness to Verginius\r\n(chapter 2).\r\n\r\nThe conspiracy of Crassus: rebellion of the Pretorians: adoption of Trajan\r\n(chapter 3).\r\n\r\nBirthplace and praise of Trajan: Nerva dies (chapter 4).\r\n\r\nHow Trajan entered upon his sovereignty (chapter 5),\r\n\r\nHe undertakes a war against Decebalus, proving himself formidable to the\r\nlatter but worthy the affection of his own people (chapters 6, 7).\r\n\r\nHe conquers the Dacians and holds a triumph over them (chapters 8-10).\r\n\r\nA second war against the Dacians (chapters 11, 12).\r\n\r\nHow Trajan saddled the Danube with a stone bridge (chapter 13).\r\n\r\nWith the disappearance from the scene of Decebalus the Dacians are reduced\r\nto the condition of a province: Arabia is taken (chapter 14).\r\n\r\nEmbassies: the Pontine marshes filled: statues to the well-deserving: the\r\ncolumn of Trajan (chapters 15, 16).\r\n\r\nCampaign against the Parthians on account of the expulsion of Exedares\r\nfrom Armenia and the introduction there of Parthomasiris (chapters 17,\r\n18).\r\n\r\nParthomasiris gains access to Trajan and Armenia is taken away from him\r\n(chapters 19, 20).\r\n\r\nHow Abgarus the Osrhoenian obtained pardon from Trajan (chapter 21).\r\n\r\nAbout the envoys of Mannus and Manisarus sent to Trajan (chapter 22).\r\n\r\nTrajan is named Optimus, and, after the capture of Nisibis and Batnae,\r\nParthicus (chapter 23).\r\n\r\nAbout the huge earthquake at Antioch (chapters 24, 25).\r\n\r\nAfter the bridging of the Tigris he reduces Adiabene, Mesopotamia, and\r\nCtesiphon (chapters 26-28).\r\n\r\nHe loses and regains several districts: he bestows a king upon the\r\nParthians (chapters 29, 30).\r\n\r\nHe besieges the Atreni without result (chapter 31).

The hatred felt for Domitian caused his\r\nimages, many of which were of silver and many of gold to be melted down;\r\nand from this source large amounts of money were obtained. The arches,\r\ntoo, of which more had been erected to the late emperor than previously to\r\nany one man, were torn down. Nerva also released such as were on trial for\r\nmaiestas and restored the exiles. All the slaves and freedmen that had\r\nconspired against their masters he put to death, and allowed that class of\r\npersons to lodge no complaint whatever against their masters. Others were\r\nnot permitted to accuse anybody for maiestas or for \"Jewish living.\" Many\r\nwho had been sycophants were condemned to death, among whom was Seras\r\n[Lacuna] [Footnote: The name is suspicious and possibly a corrupt\r\nreading.] the philosopher. Now, as a quite extraordinary disturbance arose\r\nfrom the fact that everybody was accusing everybody else, Fronto, the\r\nconsul, is said to have remarked that it was bad to have an emperor under\r\nwhom no one could do anything, but worse to have one under whom any one\r\ncould do everything. Nerva, on hearing this, prohibited the future\r\nrecurrence of such scenes. But Nerva, as a result of old age and sickness\r\n(which was always making him vomit his food), was rather weak.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--2--] He also forbade gold statues being made in his honor. He\r\npaid back to such as under Domitian had been causelessly deprived of their\r\nproperty all that was still found in the imperial treasury. To the very\r\npoor Romans he granted allotments of land worth in the aggregate fifteen\r\nhundred myriads, and put certain senators in charge of their purchase and\r\ndistribution. When he ran short of funds he sold many robes and plate,\r\nboth silver and gold, besides furniture, both his own and what belonged to\r\nthe imperial residence, many fields and houses,--in fact, everything save\r\nwhat was quite necessary. He did not, however, haggle over the prices of\r\nthem, and in this very point benefited many persons. He abolished many\r\nsacrifices, many horse-races, and some other spectacles, in an attempt to\r\nreduce expenses as far as possible. In the senate he took oath that he\r\nwould not cause the death of any of the senators and he kept his pledge in\r\nspite of plots. And he did nothing without the advice of prominent men.\r\nAmong his various laws were those prohibiting any one from being made a\r\neunuch and from marrying one's niece. When consul he did not hesitate to\r\ntake as his colleague Verginius Rufus, though the latter had been\r\nfrequently saluted as emperor. [Footnote: Compare Book Sixty-three,\r\nchapter 25 of Dio, and also Tacitus, _Historiae_ I, 9.] [Sidenote:\r\nA.D. 97 (a.u. 850)] Upon his monument was inscribed when he died: \"Having\r\nconquered Vindex he ascribed the credit of victory not to himself but to\r\nhis country.\" [Footnote: Compare also Pliny's Letters, Book Six, number\r\n10.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--3--] Nerva ruled so well that he once remarked: \"I have done\r\nnothing that could prevent me from laying down the imperial office and\r\nreturning to private life in safety.\" When Crassus Calpurnius, a grandson\r\nof the famous Crassi, formed a plot with some others against him, he made\r\nthem sit beside him at a spectacle--they were still ignorant of the fact\r\nthat they had been informed upon--and gave them some swords, nominally to\r\nlook at and see if they were sharp (as was often done), but really by way\r\nof showing that he did not care if he died that moment where he was.\r\n\r\nAelianus Casperius, who was governor under him as he had been under\r\nDomitian, and had become one of the Pretorians, incited the soldiers to\r\nmutiny against him; his plan was to have them demand some persons for\r\nexecution. Nerva resisted them stoutly, even to the point of baring his\r\ncollar-bone and offering them his throat: but he accomplished nothing and\r\nthose whom Aelianus wished were put out of the way. Wherefore Nerva,\r\nsubjected to such profound humiliation because of his old age, ascended\r\nthe Capitol and cried aloud: \"To the good fortune of the Roman people and\r\nsenate and myself I adopt Marcus Ulpius Nerva Trajan.\"\r\n\r\nSubsequently in the senate he designated him Caesar and sent a message to\r\nhim, written with his own hand (Trajan was governor of Germany):\r\n\r\n  \"The Danaans by thy weapons shall requite my tears.\" [Footnote: From\r\n  Homer's Iliad, Book One, verse 42.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--4--] Thus did Trajan become Caesar and afterwards emperor,\r\nalthough there were relatives of Nerva. But the man did not esteem family\r\nrelationship above the safety of the State, nor was he less inclined to\r\nadopt Trajan because the latter was a Spaniard instead of an Italian or\r\nItaliot, [Footnote: Dio means by _Italian_ one born in Italy, by\r\n_Italiot_ one who settles in Italy.] or because no foreigner had\r\npreviously held the Roman sovereignty. It was a person's virtue and not\r\nhis country that he thought needed examination.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 98 (a.u. 851)] Soon after this act he passed away, having\r\nruled during the period of one year, four months and nine days. His life\r\nprior to that time [Footnote: Reading [Greek: proebebiochei]\r\n(Boissevain).] had comprised sixty-five years, ten months, and ten days.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--5--] Trajan, before he became emperor, had had a dream of the\r\nfollowing nature. He thought that an old man in purple robe and vesture,\r\nmoreover adorned with a crown, as the senate is represented in pictures,\r\nimpressed a seal upon him with a finger ring, first on the left side of\r\nhis throat and then on the right. When he had been made emperor, he sent a\r\ndespatch to the senate written with his own hand, which stated, among\r\nother things, that he would not slay nor dishonor any man of worth. This\r\nhe confirmed by oaths not merely at that time but also later.\r\n\r\nHe sent for Aelianus and the Pretorians who had mutinied against Nerva,\r\npretending that he was going to employ them in some way, and relieved the\r\nworld of their presence. [Sidenote: A.D. 99 (a.u. 852)] When he had\r\nentered Rome he did much toward the administration of state affairs and to\r\nplease the excellent. To the former business he gave unusual attention,\r\nmaking many grants even to Italian cities for the support of their\r\nchildren, and to good citizens he did continual favors. Plotina, his wife,\r\non first going into the palace turned around so as to face the Scalae and\r\nthe populace, and said: \"My wish is to issue hence the same sort of person\r\nas I am now when I enter.\" And she so conducted herself during the entire\r\nsovereignty as to incur no censure.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 100 (a.u. 853)] [Sidenote:--6--] After spending some time\r\nin Rome he instituted a campaign against the Dacians; for he made their\r\ndeeds the object of thought and was irritated at the amount of money they\r\nwere annually getting. He likewise saw that their power and their pride\r\nwere increasing. Decebalus, learning of his advance, was frightened, since\r\nhe well knew that formerly he had conquered not the Romans but Domitian,\r\nwhereas now he would be fighting against both Romans and Trajan as emperor.\r\n\r\nAnd Trajan had a great reputation for justice, for bravery, and for simple\r\nliving. He was strong in body (being in his forty-second year when he\r\nbegan to rule) [so that in every enterprise he toiled almost as much as\r\nthe rest;] and his intellectual powers were at their highest, so that he\r\nhad neither the recklessness of youth nor the sluggishness of old age. He\r\ndid not envy nor kill any one, but honored and exalted all without\r\nexception that were men of worth, and hence he neither feared nor hated\r\none of them. To slanders he paid very little heed and was no slave of\r\nanger. He refrained equally from the money of others and from unjust\r\nmurders. [Sidenote:--7--] He expended vast sums on wars and vast sums on\r\nworks of peace; and while making very many most necessary repairs on roads\r\nand harbors and public buildings, he drained no one's blood for these\r\nundertakings. His nature was so noble and magnanimous that even upon the\r\nhippodrome he merely inscribed the statement that he had made it suitable\r\nfor the Roman people when it had crumbled away in spots, and had rendered\r\nit larger and more beautiful. For these deeds he was better satisfied to\r\nbe loved than honored. His meetings with the people were marked by\r\naffability and his intercourse with the senate by dignity. He was loved by\r\nall and dreaded by none save the enemy. He joined people in hunting and\r\nbanquets, and in work and plans and jokes. Often he would make a fourth in\r\nsomebody's litter, and sometimes he would enter persons' houses even\r\nwithout a guard and make himself at home. He lacked education in the exact\r\nsense,--book-learning, at least,--but he both understood and carried out\r\nits spirit, and there was no quality of his that was not _excellent_.\r\nI know well enough that he was given to wine and boys, but if he had ever\r\ncommitted or endured any base or wicked deed as a result of this, he would\r\nhave incurred censure. As the case stood, he drank all the wine he wanted,\r\nyet remained sober, and his pursuit of pederasty harmed no one. And even\r\nif he did delight in war, still he was satisfied with success in it,--with\r\noverthrowing a most hostile element and bettering his own side. Nor did\r\nthe usual thing under such circumstances,--conceit and arrogance on the\r\npart of the soldiers,--ever manifest itself during his reign; with such a\r\nfirm hand did he rule them. For these reasons Decebalus was somewhat\r\njustified in fearing him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--8--] When Trajan, in the course of his campaign against the\r\nDacians had come near Tapai, where the barbarians were encamping, a large\r\nmushroom was brought to him, on which it said in Latin characters that the\r\nBuri and other allies advised Trajan to turn back and make peace. At\r\nTrajan's first encounter with the foe he visited many of the wounded on\r\nhis own side and killed many of the enemy. And when the bandages gave out,\r\nhe is said not to have spared even his own clothing, but to have cut it up\r\ninto strips. In honor of the soldiers that had died in battle he ordered\r\nan altar erected and the performance of funeral rites annually.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--9--] [Decebalus had sent envoys also before the defeat, and no\r\nlonger the long-haired men, as before, but the chief among the\r\ncap-wearers. [Footnote: Latin, _pileati_. The distinction drawn is\r\nthat between the plebeians and the _nobles_, to whom reference is\r\nmade respectively by the terms \"unshorn\" and \"covered.\" Compare here the\r\nmake up of the Marcomanian embassy in Book Seventy-two, chapter two.]\r\nThese threw down their arms and casting themselves upon the earth begged\r\nTrajan that if possible Decebalus himself be allowed to meet and confer\r\nwith him, promising that he would do everything that might be commanded;\r\nor, if not, that at least some one should be despatched to agree upon\r\nterms with him. Those sent were Sura and Claudius Livianus, the prefect;\r\nbut nothing was accomplished, for Decebalus did not dare even to come near\r\nthem. He sent representatives also on this occasion.\r\n\r\nTrajan had now seized some fortified mountains and on them found the arms\r\nand the captured engines, as well as the standard which had been taken in\r\nthe time Fuscus. [Sidenote: A.D. 101 (a.u. 854)] Undertaking to ascend the\r\nheights themselves, he secured one crest after another amid dangers and\r\napproached the capital of the Dacians. Lusius, attacking in another\r\nquarter, slaughtered numbers and captured still more alive. Then Decebalus\r\nsent envoys.\r\n\r\nDecebalus, for this reason, and particularly because Maximus at the same\r\ntime had possession of his sister and a strong position, was ready to\r\nagree without exception to every demand made. It was not that he intended\r\nto abide by his agreement, but he wanted to secure a respite from his\r\ntemporary reverses.] So, though against his will, he made a compact to\r\nsurrender his arms, engines, and manufacturers of engines, to give back\r\nthe deserters, to demolish his forts, to withdraw from captured territory,\r\nand furthermore to consider the same persons enemies and friends as the\r\nRomans did [besides neither giving shelter to any of the deserters,\r\n[Footnote: Reading [Greek: automolon tina] (Boissevain).] nor employing\r\nany soldiers from the Roman empire, for he had acquired the largest and\r\nbest part of his force by persuading them to come from that quarter]. When\r\nhe came into Trajan's presence, he fell upon the earth and did obeisance\r\n[and cast away his arms. He also sent envoys to the senate to secure these\r\nterms, in order that he might have the further ratification of the peace\r\nby that body. At the conclusion of this compact the emperor left a camp in\r\nSarmizegethusa, and, having placed garrisons at intervals through the\r\nremainder of the territory, returned to Italy.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 103 (a.u. 856)] [Sidenote:--10--] The envoys from\r\nDecebalus were introduced in the senate. They laid down their arms,\r\nclasped their hands in the posture of captives, and spoke some words of\r\nsupplication; thus they obtained peace and received back their arms.\r\nTrajan celebrated a triumph and was given the title of Dacicus; in the\r\ntheatre he had contests of gladiators, in whom he delighted, and he\r\nbrought back dancers once more to the theatre, being in love with one of\r\nthem, Pylades. However, he did not pay less attention to general\r\nadministration, as might have been expected of a warlike personage, nor\r\ndid he hold court the less: on the contrary, he conducted trials now in\r\nthe forum of Augustus, now in the porch named the Porch of Livia, and\r\noften elsewhere on a platform.\r\n\r\nAnd since Decebalus was reported to him to be acting in many ways contrary\r\nto the treaty, since he was gathering arms, receiving such as deserted,\r\nrepairing the forts, sending ambassadors to the neighbors, and injuring\r\nthose who had previously differed with him, since also he was devastating\r\nsome land of the Iazygae (which Trajan later would not give back to them\r\nwhen they asked for it), therefore, the senate voted that he was again an\r\nenemy. And Trajan again conducted the war against him, commanding in\r\nperson and not represented by others.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 104 (a.u. 857)] [Sidenote:--11--] [As numerous Dacians\r\nkept transferring their allegiance to Trajan, and for certain other\r\nreasons, Decebalus again requested peace. But since he could not be\r\npersuaded to surrender both his arms and himself, he proceeded openly to\r\ncollect troops and called the surrounding nations to his aid, saying that\r\nif they deserted him they themselves would come into danger and that it\r\nwas safer and easier by fighting on his side to preserve their freedom,\r\nbefore suffering any harm, than if they should allow his people to be\r\ndestroyed and then later be subjugated when bereft of allies.] And\r\nDecebalus in the open field came off poorly, but by craft and deceit he\r\nalmost compassed the death of Trajan. He sent into Moesia some deserters\r\nto see whether they could make away with him, inasmuch as the emperor was\r\ngenerally accessible, and now, on account of the needs of warfare,\r\nadmitted to conference absolutely every one who desired it. But this plan\r\nthey were unable to carry out, since one of them was arrested on suspicion\r\nand, under torture, revealed the entire plot.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--12--] Longinus was the commandant of the Roman camp who had\r\nmade himself a terror to the Dacian leader in warfare. The latter,\r\ntherefore, sent him an invitation and persuaded him to meet him, on the\r\npretext that he would perform whatever should be enjoined. He then\r\narrested him and questioned him publicly about Trajan's plans. As the\r\nRoman would not yield at all, he took him about with him under guard,\r\nthough not in bonds. And [Decebalus sending an envoy to Trajan, asked that\r\nhe might get back the territory as far as the Ister and receive indemnity\r\nfor all the money he had spent on the war,] in recompense for restoring\r\nLonginus to him. An ambiguous answer was returned, of a kind that would\r\nnot make Decebalus think that the emperor regarded Longinus as of either\r\ngreat value or small, the object being to prevent his being destroyed on\r\nthe one hand, or being preserved on excessive terms, on the other. So\r\nDecebalus delayed, still considering what he should do.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Longinus, having [through his freedman] secured a poison [--he\r\nhad promised Decebalus that he would reconcile Trajan to the proposition,\r\nin order that the Dacian should be as far as possible from suspecting what\r\nwas to happen, and so not keep an especially careful watch over him. Also,\r\nto enable his servant to attain safety, he wrote a letter containing a\r\nsupplication, and gave it to the freedman to carry to Trajan. Then, when\r\nhe had gone, at night he took the poison,] drank it and died. [After this\r\nevent Decebalus asked Trajan to give him back his freedman, promising to\r\ngive him in return the body of Longinus and ten captives. He sent at once\r\nthe centurion who had been captured with the dead general, assuming that\r\nthis man would arrange the matter for him; and it was from the centurion\r\nthat the whole story of Longinus was learned. However, Trajan neither sent\r\nhim back, nor surrendered the freedman, deeming his safety more valuable\r\nfor establishing the dignity of the empire than the of Longinus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--13--] Now, Trajan constructed over the Ister a stone bridge,\r\nfor which I cannot sufficiently admire him. His other works are most\r\nbrilliant, but this surpasses them. There are twenty square pieces of\r\nstone, the height of which is one hundred and fifty feet above the\r\nfoundations and the breadth sixty, and these, standing at a distance of\r\none hundred and seventy feet from one to another, are connected by arches.\r\nHow then could one fail to be astonished at the expenditure made upon\r\nthem? Or the manner in which each of them was placed in a river so deep,\r\nin water so full of eddies, on ground so slimy? It was impossible, you\r\nnote, to divert the course of the river in any direction. I have spoken of\r\nthe breadth of the river; but the stream is not uniformly so limited,\r\nsince it covers in some places twice and elsewhere thrice as much ground,\r\nbut the narrowest point, and the one in that region most adapted to\r\nbridge-building, has just those dimensions. Yet the very fact that the\r\nriver here shrinks from a great flood to such a narrow channel and is here\r\nconfined, though it again expands into a greater flood, makes it all the\r\nmore violent and deep; and this feature must be considered in estimating\r\nthe difficulty of preparing a bridge. This achievement, then, shows the\r\ngreatness of Trajan's designs, though the bridge is of no particular use\r\nto us. Merely the piers are standing, affording no means of crossing, as\r\nif they were erected for the sole purpose of demonstrating that there is\r\nnothing which human energy can not accomplish. Trajan's reason for\r\nconstructing the bridge was his fear that, some time when the Ister was\r\nfrozen, war might be made on the Romans across the water, and his desire\r\nto enjoy the easy access to them that this work would permit. Hadrian, on\r\nthe contrary, was afraid that the barbarians might overpower the guard at\r\nthe bridge and cross into Moesia, and so he removed the surface work.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 105 (a.u. 858)] [Sidenote:--14--] Trajan, having crossed\r\nthe Ister on this bridge, conducted the war with prudence, rather than\r\nwith haste, and eventually, after a hard struggle, vanquished the Dacians.\r\nIn the course of these encounters he personally performed many deeds of\r\ngood generalship and bravery, and his soldiers ran many risks and\r\ndisplayed great prowess on his behalf. It was here that a certain\r\nhorseman, dangerously wounded, was carried from the battle on the\r\nsupposition that he could be healed; but, when he found that he could not\r\nrecover, he rushed from his quarters (since his hurt had not incapacitated\r\nhim) and stationing himself in the line again he perished, after having\r\ndisplayed great valor. [Sidenote: A.D. 106 (a.u. 859)] Decebalus, when his\r\ncapital and all his territory had been occupied and he was himself in\r\ndanger of being captured, committed suicide, and his head was brought to\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nIn this way Dacia became subject to Rome and Trajan founded cities there.\r\nThe treasures of Decebalus were also discovered, though hidden beneath the\r\nSargetia river, which ran past his palace. He had made some captives\r\ndivert the course of the river and had then excavated its bed. There he\r\nhad placed a large amount of silver and of gold and other objects of great\r\nvalue, that could endure some moisture, had heaped stones over them and\r\npiled on earth. After that he had let the river flow over them. The same\r\ncaptives were compelled to deposit his robes and other similar objects in\r\nneighboring caves; and when he had effected this, he made away with them\r\nto prevent their talking. But Bicilis, a comrade of his, who knew what had\r\nbeen done, was seized and gave this information.--About this same time,\r\nPalma, who was governor of Syria, subdued the portion of Arabia, near\r\nPetra, and made it subservient to the Romans.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--15--] [The ambassadors who came from the kings were given\r\nseats by Trajan in the senatorial row at spectacles.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 107 (a.u. 860)] Upon Trajan's return to\r\nRome the greatest imaginable number of embassies came to him from the\r\nbarbarians, even the Indi being represented. And he gave spectacles on one\r\nhundred and twenty-three days. At these affairs thousands, yes, possibly\r\ntens of thousands of animals, both wild and tame, were slaughtered, and\r\nfully ten thousand gladiators fought in combat.\r\n\r\nAbout the same period he made the Pontine marshes traversable by means of\r\na stone foundation, and built roads alongside, which he furnished with\r\nmost magnificent bridges.--All the obsolete money he had melted down.\r\n\r\n\r\n[He had sworn not to commit bloodshed and he confirmed\r\nhis promise by his actions in spite of plots. He was by nature not at all\r\ngiven to duplicity or guile or harshness. He loved and greeted and honored\r\nthe good, and the rest he neglected. His age made him still more inclined\r\nto mildness.] When Licinius Sura died, he bestowed upon\r\nhim a public funeral and a statue. This man had attained such a degree of\r\nwealth and pride that he built a gymnasium for the Romans. So great was\r\nthe friendship and confidence [which Sura showed toward Trajan and Trajan\r\ntoward him that although the man was often slandered,--as naturally\r\nhappens in the case of all those who possess any influence with the\r\nemperors,--Trajan never felt a moment's suspicion or hatred. On the\r\ncontrary, when those who envied him became insistent, Trajan] went\r\n[uninvited to his house] to dinner. And having dismissed his whole\r\nbody-guard he first called Sura's physician and had him anoint his eyes\r\nand then his barber shave his chin. Anciently the emperors themselves as\r\nwell as all other people used to do this. It was Hadrian who first set the\r\nfashion of wearing a beard. When he had done this, he next took a bath and\r\nhad dinner. So the next day he said to his friends who were always in the\r\nhabit of making statements detrimental to Sura: \"If Sura had wanted to\r\nkill me, he would have killed me yesterday.\" [Sidenote:--16--] Now he did\r\na great thing in running this risk in the case of a man who had been\r\ncalumniated, but a still greater thing in believing that he would never be\r\nharmed by him.\r\n\r\nSo it was that the confidence of his mind was strengthened by his own\r\nknowledge of his dealings with Sura instead of being influenced by the\r\nfancies of others.\r\n\r\nIndeed, when he first handed to him [Footnote: Saburanus. (?)] who was to\r\nbe prefect of the Pretorians the sword which the latter required to wear\r\nby his side, he bared the blade, holding it up said: \"Take this sword, to\r\nthe end that if I rule well, you may use it for me, but if ill, against\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nHe also set up images of Sosia and Palma and Celsus, [Footnote: _L.\r\nPublilius Celsus_.]--so greatly did he esteem them above others. Those,\r\nhowever, who conspired against him (among whom was Crassus) he brought\r\nbefore the senate and caused to be punished.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 114 (a.u. 867)] Again he gathered collections of books.\r\nAnd he set up in the Forum an enormous column, to serve at once as a\r\nsepulchral monument to himself and as a reminder of his work in the Forum.\r\nThe whole region there was hilly and he dug it down for a distance\r\nequaling the height of the column, thus making the Forum level.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--17--] Next he made a campaign against the Armenians and\r\nParthians on the pretext that the Armenian king [Footnote:\r\n_Exedares_.] had obtained his diadem not at his hands but from the\r\nParthian king. [Footnote: _Osrhoes_.] His real reason, however, was a\r\ndesire to win fame. [On his campaign against the Parthians, when he had\r\nreached Athens, an embassy from Osrhoes met him asking for peace and\r\nproffering gifts. This king had learned of his advance and was terrified\r\nbecause Trajan was wont to make good his threats by deeds. Therefore he\r\nhumbled his pride and sent a supplication that war be not made against\r\nhim: he asked Armenia for Parthomasiris, who was likewise a son of\r\nPacorus, and requested that the diadem be sent to him. He had put a stop,\r\nhe said, to the reign of Exedares, who was beneficial neither to the\r\nRomans nor to the Parthians.\r\n\r\nThe emperor neither received the gifts, nor sent any answer or command,\r\nsave that friendship is determined by deeds and not by words; and that\r\naccordingly when he should reach Syria he would do what was proper.\r\n\r\nAnd being of this mind he proceeded through Asia, Syria, and adjoining\r\nprovinces to Seleucia. Upon his coming to Antioch, Abgarus the Osrhoenian\r\ndid not appear in person, but sent gifts and a friendly communication.\r\nFor, as he dreaded both him and the Parthians, he was trying to play a\r\ndouble game and for that reason would not come to confer with him.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--19--] Parthomasiris behaved in rather violent fashion. In his\r\nfirst letter to Trajan he had signed himself as king, but when no answer\r\ncame to his epistle, he wrote again, omitting this title, and asked that\r\nMarcus Junius, the governor of Cappadocia, be sent to him, implying that\r\nhe wanted to prefer some request through him. Trajan, accordingly, sent\r\nhim the son of Junius, and himself went ahead to Arsamosata, of which he\r\ntook possession without a struggle. Then he came to Satala and rewarded\r\nwith gifts Anchialus, the king of the Heniochi and Machelones. At Elegeia\r\nin Armenia he awaited Parthomasiris. He was seated upon a platform in the\r\ntrenches. The prince greeted him, took off his diadem from his head, and\r\nlaid it at his feet. Then he stood there in silence, expecting to receive\r\nit back. At this the soldiers shouted aloud, and hailed Trajan imperator\r\nas if on account of some victory. (They termed it an uncrowned, [Footnote:\r\nReading [Greek: haselinon] (Bekker) = \"without the parsley crown\" (such as\r\nwas bestowed upon victors in some of the Greek games).] bloodless victory\r\nto see the king, a descendant of Arsaces, a son of Pacorus, and a nephew\r\nof Osrhoes, standing beside Trajan without a diadem, like a captive). The\r\nshout terrified the prince, who thought that it heralded insult and\r\ndestruction for him. He turned about as if to flee, but, seeing that he\r\nwas hemmed in on all sides, begged as a favor not to be obliged to speak\r\nbefore the crowd. Accordingly, he was escorted into the tent, where he had\r\nnone of his wishes granted. [Sidenote:--20--] So out he rushed in a rage,\r\nand from there out of the camp, but Trajan sent for him, and again\r\nascending the platform bade him speak in the hearing of all everything\r\nthat he desired. This was to prevent any person from spreading a false\r\nreport through ignorance of what had been said in private conference. On\r\nhearing this exhortation Parthomasiris no longer kept silence, but with\r\ngreat frankness made many statements, some of them being to the effect\r\nthat he had not been defeated or captured, but had come there voluntarily,\r\nbelieving that he should not be wronged and should receive back the\r\nkingdom, as Tiridates had received it from Nero. Trajan made appropriate\r\nreplies to all his remarks and said that he should abandon Armenia to no\r\none. It belonged to the Romans and should have a Roman governor. He would,\r\nhowever, allow Parthomasiris to depart to any place he pleased. So he sent\r\nthe prince away together with his Parthian companions and gave them an\r\nescort of cavalry to ensure their meeting no one and adopting no\r\nrebellious tactics. All the Armenians who had come with him he commanded\r\nto remain where they were, on the ground that they were already his\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--21--] [Leaving garrisons at opportune points Trajan came to\r\nEdessa, and there for the first time he set eyes upon Abgarus. Previously\r\nthis person had sent envoys and gifts to the prince frequently, but he\r\nhimself for different reasons at different times failed to put in an\r\nappearance. The same was true also of Mannus, the phylarch of adjoining\r\nArabia, and Sporaces, phylarch of Anthemusia. On this occasion, however,\r\nhe was persuaded partly by his son Arvandes, who was beautiful and in the\r\nprime of youth and therefore on good terms with Trajan, and partly by the\r\nfear of the latter's presence near by; consequently he met him on the\r\nroad, made his apologies, and obtained pardon. He had a powerful\r\nintercessor in the boy. Accordingly, he became a friend of Trajan's and\r\nentertained him with a banquet. At the dinner in question he presented his\r\nboy in some kind of barbaric dance.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--22--] [When Trajan came into Mesopotamia, Mannus sent a herald\r\nto him, and Manisarus despatched envoys in regard to peace, because, he\r\nsaid, Osrhoes was making a campaign against him, and he was ready to\r\nwithdraw from Armenia and Mesopotamia so far as captured. Thereupon the\r\nemperor replied that he would not believe him until he should come to him\r\nand confirm his offers by deeds, as he was promising. He was also\r\nsuspicious of Mannus, especially because the latter had sent an auxiliary\r\nforce to Mebarsapes, king of Adiabene, and then had lost it all at the\r\nhands of the Romans. Therefore Mannus never waited for the Romans to draw\r\nnear but took his course to Adiabene to find shelter with the other two\r\nprinces. Thus were Singara and some other points occupied by Lusius,\r\nwithout a battle.]\r\n\r\nWhen he had captured the whole country of Armenia and\r\nhad won over also many of the kings, some of whom, since they submitted,\r\nhe treated as his friends, and others, though disobedient, he subdued\r\nwithout resort to arms, [Sidenote:--23--] the senate voted to him many\r\nhonors of various descriptions, and they bestowed upon him the title of\r\nOptimus, i.e., Excellent.--He was always accustomed to trudge on foot with\r\nhis entire army and he had the ordering and arrangement of the troops\r\nthroughout the entire expedition, leading them sometimes in one order and\r\nsometimes in another; and he forded as many rivers as they did. Sometimes\r\nhe even had his scouts circulate false reports, in order that the soldiers\r\nmight at the same time practice military manoeuvres and be so impervious\r\nto alarm as to be ready for anything. After he had captured Nisibis and\r\nBatnae he was given the title of Parthicus. But he took greater pride in\r\nthe name of Optimus than in all the rest, inasmuch as it belonged rather\r\nto his character than to his arms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 115 (a.u. 868)] [Sidenote:--24--] While he was staying in\r\nAntioch, a dreadful earthquake occurred. Many cities were damaged, but\r\nAntioch was most of all unfortunate. Since Trajan was wintering there and\r\nmany soldiers and many private persons had flocked thither from all\r\ndirections for lawsuits, embassies, business, or sightseeing, there was no\r\nnation nor people that went unscathed. Thus in Antioch the whole world\r\nunder Roman sway suffered disaster.\r\n\r\nThere were many thunderstorms to start with and portentous winds, but no\r\none could have expected that so many evils would result from them. First\r\ncame, on a sudden, a great bellowing roar, and there followed it a\r\ntremendous shock. The whole earth was up-heaved and buildings leaped into\r\nthe air. Those that were lifted up collapsed and were smashed to pieces,\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 115 (a.u. 868)] while others were beaten this way and that\r\nas if by the surges and were turned about. The wrecks were strewn a long\r\ndistance over the countryside. The crash of grinding and breaking timbers,\r\ntiles, and stones together became most frightful, and an inconceivable\r\nmass of dust arose, so that no one could see any person nor say or hear\r\nanything. Many persons were hurt even outside the houses, being picked up\r\nand tossed violently about, and then with a momentum as in a fall from a\r\ncliff dashed to the earth. Some were maimed, others killed. Not a few\r\ntrees leaped into the air, roots and all.\r\n\r\nThe number of those found in the houses who perished was beyond discovery.\r\nMultitudes were destroyed by the very force of the collapse and crowds\r\nwere suffocated in the debris. Those who lay with a part of their bodies\r\nburied under the stones or timbers suffered fearful agony, being able\r\nneither to live nor to find an immediate death.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--25--] Nevertheless many even of these were saved, as was\r\nnatural in such overwhelming numbers of people. And those outside did not\r\nall get off safe and sound. Numbers lost their legs or their shoulders and\r\nsome [Lacuna] their [Lacuna] heads. Others vomited blood. One of these was\r\nPedo the consul, and he died at once. In brief, there was no form of\r\nviolent experience that those people did not undergo at that time. And as\r\nHeaven continued the earthquake for several days and nights, the people\r\nwere dismayed and helpless, some crushed and perishing under the weight of\r\nthe buildings pressing upon them, and others dying of hunger in case it\r\nchanced that by the inclination of the timbers they were left alive in a\r\nclear space, it might be in a kind of arch-shaped colonnade. When at last\r\nthe trouble had subsided, some one who ventured to mount the ruins caught\r\nsight of a live woman. She was not alone but had also an infant, and had\r\nendured by feeding both herself and her child with her milk. They dug her\r\nout and resuscitated her together with her offspring, and after that they\r\nsearched the other heaps but were no longer able to find in them any\r\nliving creature save a child sucking at the breasts of its mother, who was\r\ndead. As they drew out the corpses they no longer felt any pleasure at\r\ntheir own escape.\r\n\r\nSo great were the disasters that had overwhelmed Antioch at this time.\r\nTrajan made his way out through a window of the room where he was. Some\r\nbeing of more than human stature had approached him and led him forth, so\r\nthat he survived with only a few small bruises. As the shocks extended\r\nover a number of days, he lived out of doors in the hippodrome. Casium\r\nitself, too, was so shaken that its peaks seemed to bend and break and to\r\nbe falling upon the city. Other hills settled, and quantities of water not\r\npreviously in existence came to light, while quantities more escaped by\r\nflowing away.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--26--] Trajan about spring time proceeded into the enemy's\r\ncountry. Now since the region near the Tigris is barren of timbers fit for\r\nshipbuilding, he brought the boats which had been constructed in the\r\nforests surrounding Nisibis on wagons to the river. The vessels had been\r\narranged in such a way that they could be taken apart and put together. He\r\nhad very hard work in bridging the stream opposite Mount Carduenum, for\r\nthe opposing barbarians tried to hinder him. Trajan, however, had a great\r\nabundance of both ships and soldiers, and so some boats were fastened\r\ntogether with great speed while others lay motionless in front of them,\r\ncarrying heavy infantry and archers. Still others kept making dashes this\r\nway and that, as if they intended to cross. As a result of these tactics\r\nand from their very astonishment at seeing so many ships at once appear\r\n_en masse_ from a land devoid of trees the barbarians gave way and\r\nthe Romans crossed over. They won possession of the whole of Adiabene.\r\n(This is a portion of Assyria in the vicinity of Ninus; and Arbela and\r\nGaugamela, close to which Alexander conquered Darius, are also in this\r\nsame territory. The country has also been called Atyria in the language of\r\nthe barbarians, the double S being changed to T).\r\n\r\n[Adenystrae was a strong post to which one Sentius, a\r\ncenturion, had been sent as an envoy to Mebarsapes. He was imprisoned by\r\nthe latter in that place, and later, at the approach of the Romans, he\r\nmade an arrangement with some of his fellow-prisoners, and with their aid\r\nescaped from his shackles, killed the commander of the garrison, and\r\nopened the gates to his countrymen.] [Sidenote:--26--] Hereupon they\r\nadvanced as far as Babylon itself, being quite free from molestation,\r\nsince the Parthian power had been ruined by civil conflicts and was still\r\nat this time involved in dissensions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--27--] Cassius Dio Cocceianus in writings concerning the Latins\r\nhas written that this city [i.e. Babylon] comprised a circuit of four\r\nhundred stades. (Compare also Tzetzes, Exegesis of Homer's Iliad, p. 141,\r\n15 ff).\r\n\r\nHere, moreover, Trajan saw the asphalt out of which the walls of Babylon\r\nhad been built. When mixed with baked bricks or smooth stones this\r\nmaterial affords so great strength as to render them stronger than rock or\r\nany kind of iron. He also looked at the opening from which issues a deadly\r\nvapor that destroys any creature living upon the earth and any winged\r\nthing that so much as inhales a breath of it. If it extended far above\r\nground or had several vents, the place would not be inhabitable; but, as\r\nit is, this gas circles round within itself and remains stationary. Hence\r\ncreatures that fly high enough above it and such as remain to one side are\r\nsafe. I saw another opening like it at Hierapolis in Asia, and tested it\r\nby means of birds; I bent over it myself and myself gazed down upon the\r\nvapor. It is enclosed in a sort of a cistern and a theatre had been built\r\nover it. It destroys all living things save human beings that have been\r\nemasculated. The reason for that I can not comprehend. I relate what I\r\nhave seen as I have seen it and what I have heard as I have heard it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 116 (a.u. 869)] Trajan had planned to conduct the\r\nEuphrates through a channel into the Tigris, in order that boats might be\r\nfloated down by this route, affording him an opportunity to make a bridge.\r\nBut on learning that it had a much higher elevation than the Tigris, he\r\ndid not do it, fearing that the water might rush pell-mell down hill and\r\nrender the Euphrates unnavigable. So he conveyed the boats across by means\r\nof hauling engines at the point where the space between the rivers is the\r\nleast--the whole stream of the Euphrates empties into a swamp and from\r\nthere somehow joins the Tigris--then crossed the Tigris and entered\r\nCtesiphon. Having taken possession of this town he was saluted as\r\nimperator and established his right to the title of Parthicus. Various\r\nhonors were voted him by the senate, among others the privilege of\r\ncelebrating as many triumphs as he might desire.\r\n\r\nAfter his capture of Ctesiphon he felt a wish to sail down into the Red\r\nSea. This is a part of the ocean and has been so named [Footnote: [Greek:\r\nerythra] from Erythras, who was said to have been drowned in it (as if in\r\nEnglish we should invent a King Redd).] from some person formerly ruler\r\nthere. Mesene, the island in the Tigris of which Athambelus was king, he\r\nacquired without difficulty. [And it remained loyal to Trajan, although\r\nordered to pay tribute.] But through a storm, and the violence of the\r\nTigris, and the backward flow from the ocean, he fell into danger. The\r\ninhabitants of the so-called palisade of Spasinus [they were subject to\r\nthe dominion of Athambelus] received him kindly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--29--] Thence he came to the ocean itself, and when he had\r\nlearned its nature and seen a boat sailing to India, he said: \"I should\r\ncertainly have crossed over to the Indi, if I were still young.\" He gave\r\nmuch thought to the Indi, and was curious about their affairs. Alexander\r\nhe counted a happy man and at the same time declared that he himself had\r\nadvanced farther. This was the tenor of the despatch that he forwarded to\r\nthe senate, although he was unable to preserve even what territory had\r\nbeen subdued. On its receipt he obtained among other honors the privilege\r\nof celebrating a triumph for as many nations as he pleased. For, on\r\naccount of the number of those peoples regarding which communications in\r\nwriting were being constantly forwarded to them, they were unable to\r\nunderstand them or even to name some of them correctly. So the citizens of\r\nthe capital prepared a trophy-bearing arch, besides many other decorations\r\nin his own forum, and were getting themselves in readiness to meet him\r\nsome distance out when he should return. But he was destined never to\r\nreach Rome again nor to accomplish anything deserving comparison with his\r\nprevious exploits, and furthermore to lose even those earlier\r\nacquisitions. For, during the time that he was sailing down the ocean and\r\nreturning from there again, all his conquests were thrown into tumult and\r\nrevolted. And the garrisons placed among the various peoples were in some\r\ncases driven out and in others killed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--30--] Trajan ascertained this in Babylon. [Footnote: The\r\nTauchnitz reading, [Greek: en ploio] will not fit the context. Just below\r\n[Greek: ithous] (Bekker) has to be read for [Greek: mythous].] He had\r\ntaken the side-trip there on the basis of reports, unmerited by aught that\r\nhe saw (which were merely mounds and stones and ruins), and for the sake\r\nof Alexander, to whose spirit he offered sacrifice in the room where he\r\nhad died. When, therefore, he ascertained it, he sent Lusius and Maximus\r\nagainst the rebels. The latter perished after a defeat in the field; but\r\nLusius was generally successful, recovering Nisibis, besieging Edessa,\r\nplundering and burning. Seleucia was also captured by Erucius Clarus and\r\nJulius Alexander, lieutenants, and was burned. Trajan, in fear that the\r\nParthians, too, might begin some revolt, decided to give them a king of\r\ntheir own. And when he came to Ctesiphon he called together in a great\r\nplain all the Romans and likewise all the Parthians that were there at the\r\ntime. He mounted a lofty platform, and, after describing in lofty language\r\nwhat he had accomplished, he appointed Parthamaspates king of the\r\nParthians and set the diadem upon his head.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LXXV, 9, 6] When Volgaesus, the son of Sanatruces, confronted\r\nin battle array the followers of Severus and before coming to an actual\r\ntest of strength asked and secured an armistice, Trajan sent envoys to him\r\nand granted him a portion of Armenia in return for peace.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--31--] Next he came into Arabia and commenced operations\r\nagainst the people of Hatra, since they, too, had revolted. This city is\r\nneither large nor prosperous. The surrounding country is mostly desert and\r\nholds no water (save a small amount, poor in quality), nor timber, nor\r\nherb. It is protected by these very features, which make a siege in any\r\nform impossible, and by the Sun, to whom it is, in a way, consecrated. It\r\nwas neither at this time taken by Trajan nor later by Severus, although\r\nthey knocked down some parts of its wall. Trajan sent the cavalry ahead\r\nagainst the wall but failed in his attempt, and the attacking force was\r\nhurled back into the camp. As he was riding by, he barely missed being\r\nwounded himself, in spite of the fact that he had laid aside his imperial\r\nattire to avoid being recognized. Seeing the majestic gray head and his\r\naugust countenance they suspected him to be the man he was, shot at him,\r\nand killed a cavalryman in his escort. There were peals of thunder and\r\nrainbow tints glimmered indistinctly. Flashes of lightning and spray-like\r\nstorms, hail and thunderbolts fell upon the Romans as often as they made\r\nassaults. And whenever they ate a meal, flies settled on the food and\r\ndrink causing universal discomfort. Thus Trajan left the place and not\r\nlong after began to fail in health.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--32--] Meanwhile the Jews in the region of Cyrene had put one\r\nAndreas at their head and were destroying both the Romans and the Greeks.\r\nThey would cook their flesh, make belts for themselves of their entrails,\r\nanoint themselves with their blood, and wear their skins for clothing.\r\nMany they sawed in two, from the head downwards. Others they would give to\r\nwild beasts and force still others to fight as gladiators. In all,\r\nconsequently, two hundred and twenty thousand perished. In Egypt, also,\r\nthey performed many similar deeds, and in Cyprus under the leadership of\r\nArtemio. There, likewise, two hundred and forty thousand perished. For\r\nthis reason no Jew may set foot in that land, but even if one of them is\r\ndriven upon the island by force of the wind, he is put to death. Various\r\npersons took part in subduing these Jews, one being Lusius, who was sent\r\nby Trajan.\r\n\r\n[Lusius Quietus was a Moor, himself a leader of the\r\nMoors, and had belonged to [Footnote: Some puzzling corruption in the MS.]\r\na troop in the cavalry. Condemned for base conduct he was temporarily\r\nrelieved of his command and dishonored. [Footnote: Probably in the days of\r\nDomitian.] But later, when the Dacian war came on and the army stood in\r\nneed of the Moorish alliance, he came to it of his own accord and gave\r\ngreat exhibitions of prowess. For this he was honored, and in the second\r\nwar performed far greater and more numerous exploits. Finally, he advanced\r\nso far in bravery and good fortune during this war which we are\r\nconsidering that he was enrolled among the ex-praetors, became consul, and\r\ngoverned Palestine. To this chiefly was due the jealousy and hatred felt\r\nfor him, and his destruction.] Now when Trajan had invaded the hostile\r\nterritory, the satraps and kings of that region approached him with gifts.\r\n One of these gifts was a horse taught to do obeisance. It would kneel\r\nwith its front legs and place its head beneath the feet of whoever stood\r\nnear.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 117 (a.u. 870)] [Sidenote:--33--] Now Trajan was preparing\r\nto make a new expedition into Mesopotamia. Finding himself, however, held\r\nfast by the clutches of the disease, he started to sail to Italy himself\r\nand left behind Publius Aelius Hadrian with the army in Syria. So the\r\nRomans, who had conquered Armenia, most of Mesopotamia, and the Parthians,\r\nhad labored in vain and had vainly undergone danger. The Parthians\r\ndisdained Parthamaspates and began to have kings according to their\r\noriginal custom. Trajan suspected that his falling sick was due to the\r\nadministration of poison. Some declare it was because his blood, which\r\nannually descended into the lower part of his body, was kept from flowing.\r\nHe had also become paralyzed, so that part of his body was disabled, and\r\nhis general diathesis was dropsical. And on coming to Selinus in Cilicia,\r\nwhich we also call Traianoupolis, he suddenly expired after a reign of\r\nnineteen years, six months, and fifteen days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIO'S ROMAN HISTORY\r\n69\r\n\r\nHadrian without being adopted succeeds, through the favor of Plotina\r\n(chapters 1, 2).\r\n\r\nAbout the assassinations authorized by Hadrian: about his varied learning\r\nand jealousies (chapters 3, 4).\r\n\r\nHis virtues, particularly affability and generosity: old arrears of debt\r\nforgiven (chapters 5, 8).\r\n\r\nTravels: discipline of the army reformed: interest in hunting (chapters 9,\r\n10).\r\n\r\nHow he honored Antinous with various marks of remembrance (chapter 11).\r\n\r\nUprising of Jews on account of the founding of Capitolina: Bithynia\r\nrecovered (chapters 12-14).\r\n\r\nThe Albanians are held in check: Pharasmanes the Iberian is honored\r\n(chapter 15).\r\n\r\nThe Temple of Jupiter Olympius and the Panellenium are consecrated\r\n(chapter 16).\r\n\r\nGrowing ill, he adopts Commodus, slays Servianus: the distinguished\r\nservices of Turbo, Fronto, Similis (chapters 17-19).\r\n\r\nOn the death of Commodus he adopts Antoninus, the latter adopting at the\r\nsame time Marcus and Verus (chapters 20, 21).\r\n\r\nHow Hadrian departed this life (chapters 22, 23).\r\n\r\n\r\nDURATION OF TIME.\r\n\r\nQuinctius Niger, Vipsanius Apronianus.

He was merely a fellow-citizen of the latter, had\r\nenjoyed Trajan's services as guardian, was of near kin to him, and had\r\nmarried his niece. In fine, he was a companion of his, sharing his daily\r\nlife, and had been assigned to Syria for the Parthian War. However, he had\r\nreceived no distinguishing mark of favor from Trajan and had not been one\r\nof the first to be appointed consul. His position as Caesar and emperor\r\nwas due to the fact that, when Trajan died without an heir, Attianus, a\r\nfellow-citizen and former guardian, together with Plotina, who was in love\r\nwith him, secured him the appointment,--their efforts being facilitated by\r\nhis proximity and his having a large force under his command. My father\r\nApronianus, who was governor of Cilicia, had ascertained accurately the\r\nwhole story about him. He used to relate the different incidents, and said\r\nin particular that the death of Trajan was concealed for several days to\r\nthe end that the adoption might be announced. This was shown also by his\r\nletters to the senate, the signature upon which was not his, but\r\nPlotina's. She had not done this in any previous instance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--2--] At the time that he was declared emperor, Hadrian was in\r\nAntioch, the metropolis of Syria, of which he was governor. In a dream\r\njust before that day he seemed to see fire descend from heaven in the\r\nmidst of clear sky and wholly fair weather and fall first upon the left of\r\nhis throat and then upon the right also, though it neither frightened nor\r\ninjured him. And Hadrian wrote to the senate, asking that his sovereignty\r\nbe confirmed also by that body, and forbidding any measure to be voted (as\r\nwas so often done) either then or thereafter that contained any special\r\nhonor for him, unless he should first himself approve it.\r\n\r\nThe bones of Trajan were deposited in his column, and the so-called\r\nParthian games continued for a number of years. At a later date even this\r\nobservance, like many others, was abolished.\r\n\r\nHadrian's rule was in general most humane. [In a letter he expresses\r\nhimself with the greatest degree of consideration for others and swears\r\nthat he will neither do anything contrary to the public advantage nor put\r\nto death any senator, calling down destruction upon himself, if he shall\r\ntransgress these principles in any way. But] Still he was spoken against\r\non account of some murders of excellent men that he had sanctioned in the\r\nbeginning of his reign and near the end of his life. And for this reason\r\nhe came near not being enrolled among the heroes. Those murdered at the\r\nbeginning were Palma and Celsus, Nigrinus and Lusius, the first two for\r\nthe alleged reason that they had conspired against him during a hunt, and\r\nthe others on certain other complaints, because they had great influence,\r\nor were in a strong position as regards wealth and fame. Hadrian felt so\r\nkeenly the talk that was made about them that he defended himself and\r\ndeclared upon oath that he had not ordered their deaths. Those that\r\nperished at the end of the reign were Servianus and his grandson Fuscus.\r\n\r\nHadrian was a pleasant man to meet and his presence shed a kind of grace.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--3--] As for Hadrian's family, he was a son of [a man of\r\nsenatorial rank, an ex-praetor] Hadrianus, [for thus he was named]. In\r\nregard to his disposition, he was fond of literature in both languages and\r\nhas left behind all kinds of prose pieces as well as compositions in\r\nverse. His ambition was insatiable, and as a result he practiced all\r\nconceivable pursuits, even the most trivial. He modeled and painted and\r\ndeclared that there was nothing in peace or in war, in imperial or in\r\nprivate life, of which he was not cognizant. [And this, of course, did\r\npeople no harm; but his jealousy of those who excelled in any branch was\r\nterrible and] ruined many besides utterly destroying quite a few. [For,]\r\nsince he desired to surpass everybody in everything, [he hated those who\r\nattained eminence in any direction.] This feeling it was which led him to\r\nundertake the overthrow of two sophists, Favorinus the Gaul and Dionysius\r\nthe Milesian, [by various methods, chiefly] by stirring up their\r\nantagonists [who were of little or no worth at all]. Dionysius is said to\r\nhave remarked at this time to Avidius [Footnote: Boissevain's reading.]\r\nHeliodorus, who managed his correspondence: \"Caesar can give you money and\r\nhonor, but he can't make you an orator.\" Favorinus was about to bring a\r\ncase before the emperor in regard to exemption from taxes, a privilege\r\nwhich he desired to secure in his native city. Suspecting, however, that\r\nhe should be unsuccessful and be insulted in addition he entered the\r\ncourtroom, to be sure, but made no other statement save: \"My teacher stood\r\nthis night in a dream by my side and bade me do service for my country,\r\nsince I have been born in it.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--4--] Now Hadrian spared these men, although he was displeased\r\nwith them, for he could find no satisfactory pretext to use against them\r\nthat might compass their destruction. But he first banished and later\r\nactually put to death Apollodorus the architect, who had planned the\r\nvarious creations of Trajan in Rome,--the forum, the odeum, and the\r\ngymnasium. The excuse given was that he had been guilty of some\r\nmisdemeanor, but the true reason was that, when Trajan was consulting him\r\non some point about the works, he had said to Hadrian, who broke in with\r\nsome remark: \"Be off and draw gourds. You don't understand any of these\r\nmatters.\" It happened that Hadrian at the time was pluming himself upon\r\nsome such drawing. When he became emperor, therefore, he remembered the\r\nslight and would not endure the man's freedom of speech. He sent him his\r\nown plan of the temple of Venus and Roma by way of showing him that a\r\ngreat work could be accomplished without his aid, and he asked Apollodorus\r\nwhether the structure was a good one. The latter in his reply said about\r\nthe temple that it ought to have been made to tower aloft in the air and\r\nhave been scooped out beneath. Then, as a result of being higher, it would\r\nhave stood out more conspicuously on the Sacred Way, and might have\r\nreceived [Sidenote: A.D. 117 (a.u. 870)] within its expanse the engines,\r\nso that they could be built unobserved and could be brought into the\r\ntheatre without any one's being aware of it beforehand. In regard to the\r\nstatues, he said that they had been made too tall for the height adopted\r\nin the principal room. \"If the goddesses,\" he said, \"wish to get up and go\r\nout, they will be unable to do so.\" When he wrote this so bluntly to\r\nHadrian, the latter was both vexed and exceedingly pained because he had\r\nfallen into a mistake that could not be set right. He restrained neither\r\nhis anger nor his grief, but murdered the man. [By nature] the emperor was\r\nsuch a person [that he was jealous not only of the living, but also of the\r\ndead. For instance,] he abolished Homer and introduced in his stead\r\nAntimachus, whose name many persons had not previously known.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--5--] These acts were charged against him as offences, and so\r\nwere also his great exactness, his superfluous labors, and his divided\r\ninterests. But he healed the wounds made and recovered favor by his\r\ngeneral care, his foresight, his grandeur and his skill. Again, he did not\r\nstir up any war and ended those already in progress. He deprived no one of\r\nmoney unjustly, and upon many peoples and private citizens and senators\r\nand knights he bestowed large sums. He did not wait to be asked, but was\r\ncertain to act each time according to each man's needs. The military he\r\ntrained with great precision, so that its strength rendered it neither\r\ndisobedient nor insolent. Allied and subject cities he aided most\r\nmunificently. He had seen many that no other emperor had even set eyes\r\nupon, and he assisted practically all of them, giving to some water, to\r\nothers harbors, or food, or public works, or money, and to still others\r\nvarious honors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--6--] As a leader of the Roman people he was distinguished for\r\nforce rather than for flattery. Once, at a gladiatorial contest, when the\r\ncrowd was urging its petition strongly, he not only would not grant its\r\nwish, but further ordered this command of Domitian's to be proclaimed: \"Be\r\nsilent.\" The words were not uttered, though. The herald raised his hand\r\nand by that very gesture quieted the people as he had been accustomed to\r\ndo. (They are never silenced by proclamation). Then, when they had become\r\nquiet, he said: \"This is what he wishes.\" Hadrian was not in the least\r\nangry with the herald; on the contrary, he honored him for not publishing\r\nthe rudeness of the order. He could endure such things and was not\r\ndispleased if he was aided in any unexpected way and by chance comers. It\r\nmust be admitted that once, when a woman passed him on some road and\r\npreferred a request, he at first said to her: \"I haven't time.\"\r\nAfterwards, when she cried out loudly, saying: \"Don't be emperor, then\",\r\nhe turned about and granted her a hearing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--7--] He transacted through the senate all serious and most\r\nurgent business and he held court with the assistance of prominent men now\r\nin the palace or again in the Forum, the Pantheon, and in many other\r\nplaces, always on a platform, so that what was done was open to public\r\ninspection. Sometimes he would join the consuls when _they_ were\r\ntrying cases, and he showed them honor at the horse-races. When he\r\nreturned home he was accustomed to be carried in a litter, in order not to\r\ntrouble any one to accompany him. On days neither sacred nor public he\r\nremained at home, and admitted no one even long enough to greet him,\r\nunless it were some urgent matter; this was to relieve the courtiers of\r\nneedless annoyance. Both in Rome and abroad he always kept the noblest men\r\nabout him; and he used to join them at banquets, which led to his being\r\noften carried in their litters as one of a party of four. As frequently as\r\npossible he went hunting, and he breakfasted without wine; in fact, most\r\nof his food was served without any accompanying beverage; and often in the\r\nmidst of a meal he would turn his attention to a case at law: later he\r\nwould drive in the company of all the foremost and best men, and their\r\neating together was the occasion for all kind of discussions. When his\r\nfriends were very ill, he would go to see them, and he used to attend\r\ntheir festivals, besides evincing pleasure at visiting their country seats\r\nand houses. As might have been expected, then, he set up in his forum\r\nimages for many who were dead and many still alive. No one of his\r\nassociates, moreover, displayed insolence nor sold aught that he should\r\npronounce or perform, as the Caesarians and other attendants in the suite\r\nof emperors have made it their custom to do.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--8--] This is a kind of preface, of a summary nature, I have\r\nbeen giving in regard to his character. I shall also touch upon all the\r\ndetails that require mention.\r\n\r\nThe Alexandrians had been rioting and nothing would make them stop until\r\nthey received a letter from Hadrian rebuking them. So true it is that an\r\nemperor's word has more power than force of arms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 118 (a.u. 871)] On coming to Rome he canceled debts owing\r\nto the imperial treasury and to the public treasury of the Romans, setting\r\na limit of sixteen years, from which and as far back as which this\r\nprovision was to be observed. On his own birthday he gave a spectacle to\r\nthe people free of charge, and slaughtered numbers of wild beasts,--one\r\nhundred lions and a like number of lionesses biting the dust on this one\r\noccasion. Gifts, likewise, he brought about by means of balls both in the\r\ntheatres and in the hippodrome, one lot for the men and one lot for the\r\nwomen. Indeed, he had also commanded them to battle separately.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was what happened that year. Euphrates the philosopher also\r\ndied a death of his own choosing; and Hadrian assented to his drinking\r\nhemlock in consideration of his extreme age and sickliness.\r\n[Sidenote:--9--] Hadrian went from one province to another, visiting the\r\ndistricts and cities and observing all the garrisons and fortifications.\r\nSome of these he removed to more desirable locations, some he abolished,\r\nand he founded some new ones. He personally oversaw and investigated\r\nabsolutely everything, not merely the usual appurtenances of camps,--I\r\nmean weapons and engines and ditches and enclosures and palisades,--but\r\nalso the private affairs of each one, and the lives, the dwellings and the\r\ncharacters both of the men serving in the organization, and of the\r\ncommanders themselves. Many cases of too delicate living and equipment he\r\nharmonized with military needs and reformed in various ways. He exercised\r\nthe men in every variety of battle, honoring some and reproving others. He\r\ntaught all of them what they ought to do. And to make sure that they\r\nshould obtain benefit from observing _him_, he led everywhere a\r\nsevere existence and walked or rode horseback on all occasions. Never at\r\nthis period did he enter either a chariot or a four-wheeled vehicle. He\r\ncovered his head neither in heat nor in cold, but alike in Celtic snows\r\nand under scorching Egyptian suns he went about with it bare. [Sidenote:\r\nA.D. 119 (a.u. 872)] In fine, so thoroughly by action and exhortations did\r\nhe train and discipline the whole military force throughout the whole\r\nempire that even now the methods then introduced by him are the soldiers'\r\nlaw of campaigning. This best explains why he lived for the most part at\r\npeace with foreign nations. As they saw what support he had and were\r\nvictims of no injustice, but instead received money, they made no\r\nuprising. So excellently had his soldiery been trained, that the cavalry\r\nof the so-called Batavians swam the Ister with their heavy armor on.\r\nSeeing this the barbarians stood in terror of the Romans, and turning\r\ntheir attention to their own affairs [Footnote: Reading [Greek: epi]\r\n(Dindorf) instead of [Greek: peri]] they employed Hadrian as an arbitrator\r\nof their differences.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--10--] He also constructed theatres and held games as he\r\ntraveled about from city to city, dispensing, however, with the imperial\r\nparaphernalia. This he never used outside of Rome. His own country, though\r\nhe did her great honor and bestowed many proud possessions on her, he\r\nnevertheless did not set eyes upon.\r\n\r\nHe is said to have been enthusiastic over hunting. Indeed, he broke his\r\ncollar-bone in this pursuit and came near losing a leg. And to a city that\r\nhe founded in Mysia he gave the name of Adrianotherae. [Sidenote: A.D. 121\r\n(a.u. 874)] However, he did not, while so occupied, leave undone any of\r\nthe duties pertaining to his office. Of his enthusiasm for hunting his\r\nhorse Borysthenes, which was his favorite steed for the chase, gives us an\r\nindication. When the animal died, he prepared a tomb for him, set up a\r\nslab, and placed an inscription upon it. Hence it is scarcely surprising\r\nthat when Plotina died, the woman through whom he had secured the imperial\r\noffice, and who was passionately in love with him, he honored her to the\r\nextent of wearing mourning garments for nine days, building a temple to\r\nher, and composing several hymns to her memory.\r\n\r\nWhen Plotina was dead, Hadrian praised her and said: \"Though she asked\r\nmuch of me, she was never refused aught.\" By this he surely meant to say:\r\n\"Her requests were of such a character that they neither burdened me nor\r\nafforded me any justification for saying no.\"\r\n\r\nHe was so skillful in hunting that once he brought down a huge boar with a\r\nsingle blow.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--11--] On reaching Greece he became a spectator at the\r\nMysteries.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 122 (a.u. 875)] After this he passed through Judaea into\r\nEgypt and offered sacrifice to Pompey, about whom, he is said to have\r\nuttered this verse:\r\n\r\n  Strange lack of tomb for one with shrines o'erwhelmed! [Footnote:\r\n  Compare Appian, Civil Wars, Book Two, chapter 86 (also Spartianus, 14,\r\n  4).]\r\n\r\nAnd he restored his monument, which had fallen to ruin. In Egypt also he\r\nrestored the so-called City of Antinous. Antinous was from Bithynium, a\r\ncity of Bithynia which we also call Claudioupolis; he had been a favorite\r\nof the emperor and had died in Egypt, either by falling into the Nile, as\r\nHadrian writes, or, as is more probably the truth, by being offered in\r\nsacrifice. For Hadrian, as I have stated, was in general a great dabbler\r\nin superstitions and employed divinations and incantations of all kinds.\r\nAccordingly, he honored Antinous either because of his love for him or\r\nbecause he had voluntarily submitted to death (it being necessary that a\r\nlife be surrendered voluntarily for the accomplishment of the ends he had\r\nin view), by building a city on the spot where he had suffered this fate\r\nand naming it after him: and he further set up likenesses, or rather\r\nsacred statues of him, practically all over the world. Finally, he\r\ndeclared that he had seen a star which he assumed to belong to Antinous,\r\nand gladly lent an ear to the fictitious tales woven by his associates to\r\nthe effect that the star had really come into being from the spirit of\r\nAntinous and had then appeared for the first time. [Sidenote: A.D. 133\r\n(a.u. 886)] On this account he became the object of some ridicule [as also\r\nbecause the death of his sister Paulina he had not immediately paid her\r\nany honor. [Lacuna]]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 133 (a.u. 886)] [Sidenote:--12--] In Jerusalem he founded\r\na city in place of the one razed to the ground, naming it Aelia\r\nCapitolina, and on the site of the temple of the god he raised a new\r\ntemple to Jupiter. This brought on a war that was not slight nor of brief\r\nduration, for the Jews deemed it intolerable that foreign races should be\r\nsettled in their city and foreign religious rites be planted there. While\r\nHadrian was close by in Egypt and again in Syria, they remained quiet,\r\nsave in so far as they purposely made the weapons they were called upon to\r\nfurnish of poorer quality, to the end that the Romans might reject them\r\nand they have the use of them. But when he went farther away, they openly\r\nrevolted. To be sure, they did not dare try conclusions with the Romans in\r\nthe open field, but they occupied advantageous positions in the country\r\nand strengthened them with mines and walls, in order that they might have\r\nplaces of refuge whenever they should be hard pressed, and meet together\r\nunobserved under ground; and in these subterranean passages they sunk\r\nshafts from above to let in air and light. [Sidenote:--13--] At first the\r\nRomans made no account of them. Soon, however, all Judaea had been\r\nup-heaved, and the Jews all over the world were showing signs of\r\ndisturbance, were gathering together, and giving evidence of great\r\nhostility to the Romans, partly by secret and partly by open acts; many\r\nother outside nations, too, were joining them through eagerness for gain,\r\nand the whole earth, almost, was becoming convulsed over the matter. Then,\r\nindeed, did Hadrian send against them his best generals, of who Julius\r\nSeverus was the first to be despatched, from Britain, of which he was\r\ngovernor, against the Jews. He did not venture to attack his opponents at\r\nany one point, seeing their numbers and their desperation, but by taking\r\nthem in separate groups by means of the number of his soldiers and his\r\nunder-officers and by depriving them of food and shutting them up he was\r\nable, rather slowly, to be sure, but with comparatively little danger, to\r\ncrush and exhaust and exterminate them. Very few of them survived.\r\n[Sidenote:--14--] Fifty of their most important garrisons and nine hundred\r\nand eighty-five of their most renowned towns were blotted out. Fifty-eight\r\nmyriads of men were slaughtered in the course of the invasions and\r\nbattles, and the number of those that perished by famine and disease and\r\nfire was past all investigating. Thus nearly the whole of Judaea was made\r\ndesolate, an event of which the people had had indications even before the\r\nwar. The tomb of Solomon, which these men regarded as one of their sacred\r\nobjects, fell to pieces of itself and collapsed and many wolves and hyenas\r\nrushed howling into their cities.\r\n\r\nMany Romans, moreover, perished in the war. Wherefore Hadrian in writing\r\nto the senate did not employ the opening phrase commonly affected by the\r\nemperors: \"If you and your children are in health, it shall be well: I and\r\nthe armies are in health.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 134(?)] Severus [Footnote: Not the same person as is\r\nmentioned in the previous chapter.] he sent into Bithynia, which needed no\r\nforce of arms but a governor and presiding officer who was just and\r\nprudent and had a reputation. All these qualifications Severus possessed.\r\nAnd he managed and administered both their private and their public\r\naffairs in such a way that we [Footnote: i.e., \"we natives of Bithynia\"\r\n(Dio's country).] are still, even to-day wont to remember him. [Pamphylia\r\nin place of Bithynia was given into the jurisdiction of the senate and the\r\nlot.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--15--] This, then, was the ending that the war with the Jews\r\ntook. A second war was started among the Alani (they are Massagetae) by\r\nPharasmanes. On Albanis and Media he inflicted severe injury and then laid\r\nhold on Armenia and Cappadocia, after which, as the Alani were on the one\r\nhand persuaded by gifts from Vologaesus and on the other stood in dread of\r\nFlavius Arrianus, the governor of Cappadocia, he stopped. [Envoys were\r\nsent from Vologaesus and from the Iazygae; the former made some charges\r\nagainst Pharasmanes and the latter wanted to confirm the peace. [?]\r\n[Footnote: It is impossible to determine, from the date of this fragment,\r\nwhether the subject should be Hadrian or Antoninus Pius.] introduced them\r\nto the senate and was empowered by that body to return appropriate\r\nanswers; and accordingly he prepared and read to them his responses.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--16--] Hadrian completed the Olympieum in Athens, in which his\r\nown statue also stands, and consecrated there a serpent, which was brought\r\nfrom India. He also presided at the Dionysia, the greatest office within\r\nthe gift of the people, and arrayed in the local costume carried it\r\nthrough brilliantly. He allowed the Greeks, too, to build his sepulchre\r\n(called the Panellenium), and instituted a series of games to be connected\r\nwith it; and he granted to the Athenians large sums of money, annual corn\r\ndistribution, and the whole of Cephallenia.--Among various laws that he\r\nenacted was one to the effect that no senator, either personally or\r\nthrough the medium of another, should have any tax farmed out to him.\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 135 (a.u. 888)] After he had come to Rome, the crowd at a\r\nspectacle shouted their request for the emancipation of a certain\r\ncharioteer: but he replied by means of a writing on a board: \"It is not\r\nright for you either to ask me to free another's slave or to force his\r\nmaster to do so.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--17--] He now began to be sick, having suffered even before\r\nthis from blood gushing from his nostrils: this flow now grew very much\r\nmore copious, so that he despaired of his life. Consequently, he appointed\r\nas Caesar for the Romans Lucius Commodus, although this man frequently\r\nvomited blood. [Sidenote: A.D. 136 (a.u. 889)] Servianus and his grandson\r\nFuscus, the former a nonagenarian and the latter eighteen years of age,\r\nwere put to death on the ground that they were displeased at this action.\r\nServianus before being executed asked for fire, and as he offered incense\r\nhe exclaimed: \"That I am guilty of no wrong, ye; O Gods, are well aware:\r\nand as for Hadrian I pray only this, that he may desire to die and not be\r\nable.\" And, indeed, Hadrian did come to his end only after often praying\r\nthat he might expire and often feeling a desire to kill himself. There is\r\nin existence also a letter of his which lays stress on this very matter,\r\nshowing what a dreadful thing it is for a man to desire to die and not be\r\nable. This Servianus had been by Hadrian deemed capable of filling the\r\nimperial office. He had once at a banquet told his friends to name for him\r\nten men who were competent to be sole rulers, and then after a moment's\r\npause, had added: \"I want to know _nine_: I have one already,\r\nServianus.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--18--] Other excellent men, also, had come to light during that\r\nperiod, of whom the most distinguished were Turbo and Similis, who,\r\nindeed, were honored with statues.\r\n\r\nTurbo was a man of great qualities as a general, who had become prefect\r\n(or commander of the Pretorians). He committed no act of luxury or\r\nhaughtiness, but lived like one of the multitude: the entire day he spent\r\nin proximity to the palace and often he would go there even shortly before\r\nmidnight, when some of the others were beginning to sleep. A\r\ncharacteristic anecdote is that which brings in the name of Cornelius\r\nFronto, at this time reputed to be the foremost Roman advocate in\r\nlawsuits. One evening very late he was returning home from dinner and\r\nascertained from a man whose counsel he had promised to be that Turbo was\r\nholding court. Accordingly, just as he was, in his dress for dinner, he\r\nwent into his courtroom and greeted him not with the morning salutation,\r\n_I wish you joy_, but with that belonging to the evening, _I trust\r\nyour health continues good_.\r\n\r\nTurbo was never seen at home in the daytime even when he was sick; and to\r\nHadrian, who advised him to remain quiet, he replied: \"The prefect ought\r\nto die on his feet.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--19--] Similis, who was of greater age and more advanced rank,\r\nin character was second to none of the great men, I think. Very slight\r\nthings may serve us as evidence. When he was centurion, Trajan had\r\nsummoned him to enter his presence before the prefects, whereupon he said:\r\n\"It is a shame for you, Caesar, to be talking with a centurion, while the\r\nprefects stand outside.\" And he took unwillingly at that time the command\r\nof the Pretorians, and after taking it resigned it. Having with difficulty\r\nsecured his release he spent the rest of his life, seven years, quietly in\r\nthe country, and upon his tomb he had this inscription placed: \"Similis\r\nlies here, who existed so-and-so many years, but lived for seven.\"\r\n\r\nJulius (?) Fabius (?), not being able to endure his\r\nson's effeminacy, desired to throw himself into the river.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 138 (a.u. 891)] [Sidenote:--20--] Hadrian became\r\nconsumptive as a result of the great loss of blood, and that led to\r\ndropsy. And as it happened that Lucius Commodus was suddenly removed from\r\nthe scene by the outgushing of a large quantity of blood all at once, he\r\nconvened at his house the foremost and most renowned of the senators; and\r\nlying on a couch he spoke to them as follows: \"I, my friends, was not\r\npermitted by nature to secure offspring, but you have made it possible by\r\nlegal enactment. There is this difference between the two ways,--that a\r\nbegotten son turns out to be whatever sort of person Heaven pleases,\r\nwhereas one that is adopted a man takes to himself because he chooses just\r\nthat sort of being. Thus in process of nature a maimed and [Sidenote: A.D.\r\n138 (a.u. 891)] senseless creature is often given to a parent, but by\r\nprocess of voluntary decision one of sound body and sound mind is certain\r\nto be selected. For this cause I formerly chose out Lucius from among all,\r\na person of such attainments as I could never have prayed to find in a\r\nchild. But since the Heavenly Power has taken him from among us, I have\r\nfound an emperor in his place whom I now give you, one who is noble, mild,\r\ntractable, prudent, neither young enough to do anything reckless nor old\r\nenough to neglect aught,--one brought up according to the laws, who has\r\nheld possession of authority according to his country's traditions, so\r\nthat he is not ignorant of any matters pertaining to his office, but can\r\nhandle them all effectively. I refer to Aurelius Antoninus here. Although\r\nI know him to be the most retiring of men and to be far from desiring any\r\nsuch thing, still I do not think that he will deliberately disregard\r\neither me or you but will accept the office even against his will.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--21--] So it was that Antoninus became emperor. Since he was\r\ndestitute of male children, Hadrian adopted for him Commodus's son\r\nCommodus and, moreover, besides the latter, Marcus Annius Verus; for he\r\nwished to appoint those who were afterwards to be emperors for as long a\r\ntime ahead as possible. (This Marcus Annius, earlier named Catilius, was a\r\ngrandson of Annius Verus who had thrice been consul and prefect of the\r\ncity). And though Hadrian urged Antoninus to adopt them both, he preferred\r\nVerus on account of his kinship and his age and because he already\r\nexhibited an extremely strong cast of mind. This led him to apply to the\r\nyoung man the name Verissimus, with a play upon the meaning of the Latin\r\nword.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--22--] By certain charms and species of magic Hadrian was\r\nrelieved of the water, but shortly was full of it again. Since, therefore,\r\nhe was constantly growing worse and might be said to be slowly perishing\r\nday by day, he began to long for death. Often he would ask for poison and\r\na sword, but no one would give them to him. As no one would obey him,\r\nalthough he promised money and immunity, he sent for Mastor, an Iazygian\r\nbarbarian that had become a captive, whom he had employed in hunts on\r\naccount of his strength and daring. Then, partly by threatening him and\r\npartly by making promises, he compelled the man to undertake the duty of\r\nkilling him. He drew a colored line around a spot beneath the nipple that\r\nhad been shown him by Hermogenes the physician, in order that he might\r\nthere be struck a finishing blow and perish painlessly. But even this plan\r\ndid not succeed, for Mastor became afraid of the project and in terror\r\nwithdrew. The emperor lamented bitterly the plight in which the disease\r\nhad placed him and bitterly his powerlessness, in that he was not able to\r\nmake away with himself, though he might still, even when so near death,\r\ndestroy anybody else. Finally he abandoned his careful regimen and through\r\nusing unsuitable foods and drinks met his death, saying and shouting aloud\r\nthe popular saying: \"Many physicians have ruined a king.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--23--] He had lived sixty-two years, five months and nineteen\r\n[Footnote: Seventeen, according to the common tradition.] days, and had\r\nbeen emperor twenty years and eleven months. He was buried near the river\r\nitself, close to the Aelian bridge; that was where he had prepared his\r\ntomb, for the one belonging to Augustus was full and no other body was\r\ndeposited there.\r\n\r\nThis emperor was hated [by the people, in spite of his excellent reign] on\r\naccount of the early and the late murders, since they had been unjustly\r\nand impiously brought about. Yet he had so little of a bloodthirsty\r\ndisposition that even in the case of some who took pains to thwart him he\r\ndeemed it sufficient to write to their native lands the bare statement\r\nthat they did not please him. And if any man who had children was\r\nabsolutely obliged to receive punishment, still, in proportion to the\r\nnumber of his children he would also lighten the penalty imposed.\r\n[Notwithstanding, the senate persisted for a long time in its refusal to\r\nvote him divine honors, and in its strictures upon some of those who had\r\ncommitted excesses during his reign and had been honored therefor, when\r\nthey ought to have been chastised.]\r\n\r\nAfter Hadrian's death there was erected to him a huge equestrian statue\r\nrepresenting him with a four-horse team. It was so large that the bulkiest\r\nman could walk through the eye of each horse, yet because of the extreme\r\nheight of the monument persons passing along on the ground below are wont\r\nto think that the horses themselves as well as Hadrian are very small.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIO'S ROMAN HISTORY\r\n70\r\n\r\nAntoninus Pius, succeeding by adoption, effects the deification of Hadrian\r\n(chapter 1).\r\n\r\nThe cognomen Pius is bestowed upon Antoninus by the senate (chapter 2).\r\n\r\nHe showed little hostility toward the Christians: was careful in trifles:\r\nmet a quiet death in old age (chapter 3).\r\n\r\nEarthquake that damaged Bithynia, the Hellespontine region, and especially\r\nCyzicus (chapter 4).\r\n\r\nHe is compared with Numa: his gentleness and kindliness (chapter 5).\r\n\r\nHe was intent upon justice, not upon enlarging the empire: hence the\r\nbarbarians brought their quarrels to him to settle (chapters 6, 7).\r\n\r\n\r\nDURATION OF TIME.\r\n\r\nCamerinus, Niger.

From Dio:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 138 (a.u. 891)] [Sidenote:--1--] It should be noted that\r\ninformation about Antoninus Pius is not found in the copies of Dio,\r\nprobably because the books have met with some accident, so that the\r\nhistory of his reign is almost wholly unknown, save that when Lucius\r\nCommodus, whom Hadrian had adopted, died before Hadrian, Antoninus was\r\nalso adopted by him and became emperor, and that when the senate demurred\r\nto giving heroic honors to Hadrian after his demise on account of certain\r\nmurders of eminent men, Antoninus addressed many words to them with tears\r\nand laments, and finally said: \"I will not govern you either, if he has\r\nbecome base and inimical and a national foe in your eyes. For you will of\r\ncourse be annulling all his acts, of which my adoption was one.\" On\r\nhearing this the senate both through respect for the man and through a\r\ncertain fear of the soldiers bestowed the honors upon Hadrian.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--2--] Only this in regard to Antoninus is preserved in Dio.\r\nYes, one thing more--that the senate gave him the titles both of Augustus\r\nand of Pius for some such reason as the following. When in the beginning\r\nof his imperial reign many men were accused and some of them had been\r\ninterceded for by name, he nevertheless punished no one, saying: \"I must\r\nnot begin my career of supervision with such deeds.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LXIX, 15, 3] [When Pharasmanes the Iberian came to Rome with\r\nhis wife, he increased his domain, allowed him to offer sacrifice on the\r\nCapitoline, set up a statue of him on horseback in the temple of Bellona,\r\nand viewed an exercise in arms of the chieftain, his son, and the other\r\nprominent Iberians.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 139 (a.u. 892)] We do not find preserved, either, the\r\nfirst part of the account of Marcus Verus, who ruled after Antoninus and\r\nall that the latter himself did in the case of Lucius, son of Commodus,\r\nwhom Marcus made his son-in-law, and all that Lucius accomplished when\r\nsent by his father to the war against Vologaesus. I shall speak briefly\r\nabout these matters, gathering my material from other books, and then I\r\nshall go back to the continuation of Dio's narrative.\r\n\r\nII. From Xiphilinus:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LXX, 3] [Sidenote: A.D. 153 (a.u. 906)] Antoninus is admitted\r\nby all to have been noble and good, not oppressive to the Christians nor\r\nsevere to any of his other subjects; instead, he showed the Christians\r\ngreat respect and added to the honor in which Hadrian had been wont to\r\nhold them. For Eusebius, son of Pamphilus, cites in his Church History\r\n[Footnote: IV, 9.] some letters of Hadrian in which the latter is shown to\r\nthreaten terrible vengeance upon those who harm in any way or accuse the\r\nChristians, and to swear by Hercules that they shall receive punishment.\r\n\r\nAntoninus is said also to have been of an enquiring turn of mind and not\r\nto have held aloof from careful investigation of even small and\r\ncommonplace matters; for this those disposed to scoff called him\r\nCumminsplitter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 161 (a.u. 914)] Quadratus states that he died at an\r\nadvanced age, and that the happiest death befell him, like unto gentlest\r\nslumber.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:(A.D. 177?)] [Sidenote:--4--] In the days of Antoninus also a\r\nmost frightful earthquake is said to have occurred in the region of\r\nBithynia and the Hellespont. Various cities were severely damaged or fell\r\nwithout a building left standing, and in particular Cyzicus; and the\r\ntemple there that was the greatest and most beautiful of all temples was\r\nthrown down. Its columns were four cubits in thickness and fifty cubits in\r\nheight, each of a single block of stone; and each of the other features of\r\nthe edifice was more to be wondered at than to be praised. Somewhere in\r\nthe interior of the country the peak of a mountain rose upwards and surges\r\nof the sea are said to have gushed out, while the spray from pure,\r\ntransparent sea-water was driven to a great distance over the land.\r\n[Footnote: Compare also Zonaras V, 12 (p. 80, II. 3-11 Dind).. It is not\r\ncertain whether this earthquake properly belongs to the reign of Pius or\r\nthat of Marcus. If to the former, it must have occurred between 150 and\r\n155 B.C. See _Hermes_ XXVI, pages 444-446 (Boissevain: _Zonaras\r\nQuelle für die Romische Kaisergeschichte von Nerva bis Severus\r\nAlexander_) and XXXII, pages 497-508 (B. Keil: _Kyzikenisches_);\r\nalso _Byzantinische Zeitschrift_ I, page 30 ff. (article by de\r\nBoor).]--So much is the account of Antoninus at present extant. He reigned\r\ntwenty-four years.\r\n\r\nIII. Of Dio [or rather of Eutropius, or John of Antioch]. Taken from the\r\nWritings of Suidas.\r\n\r\nThis prince Antoninus was an excellent man and deserves to be compared\r\nespecially with Numa on account of the similarity of his reign to that\r\nking's, just as Trajan was seen to resemble Romulus. The private life that\r\nAntoninus lived was thoroughly excellent and honorable, [Sidenote:--5--]\r\nand in his position as ruler he seemed to be even more excellent and more\r\nprudent. To no one was he harsh or oppressive, but he was gracious and\r\ngentle toward all.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--6--] In warfare he sought glory rather from an impulse of duty\r\nthan from one of gain, and was determined to preserve the borders of the\r\nempire intact rather than to extend them to greater distances. In the\r\nmatter of men he appointed to the administration of public affairs, so far\r\nas possible, those who were particularly scrupulous about right conduct,\r\nand he rewarded good officials with the honors that were in his power to\r\ngrant, whereas he banished the worthless (though without any harshness)\r\nfrom the conduct of public affairs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--7--] He was admired not alone by those of his own race, but\r\neven by foreigners, as was shown by some of the neighboring barbarians\r\nlaying down their arms and permitting the prince to decide their quarrels\r\nby his vote. And whereas he had in the course of his life as a private\r\ncitizen amassed a vast amount of money, when he entered upon office he\r\nexpended his own abundance upon gifts for the soldiers and for his\r\nfriends.

He was personally weak in body and he\r\ndevoted the greater part of his time to letters. It is told that even when\r\nhe was emperor he showed no shame (or hesitation) at going to a teacher\r\nfor instruction, but became a pupil of Sextus, the Boeotian philosopher,\r\n[Footnote: \"Sextus of Chaeronea, grandson of Plutarch\" (Capitolinus,\r\n_Vita M. Antoni Philosophi_, 3, 2).] and did not hesitate to go to hear\r\nthe lectures of Hermogenes on rhetoric. He was most inclined to the Stoic\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nLucius, on the other hand, was strong and rather young, and better suited\r\nfor military enterprises. Therefore, Marcus made him his son-in-law by\r\nmarrying him to his daughter Lucilla, and sent him to the Parthian war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--2--] For Vologaesus had begun war by assailing on all sides\r\nthe Roman camp under Severianus, situated in Elegeia, a place in Armenia;\r\nand he had shot down and destroyed the whole force, leaders and all. He\r\nwas now proceeding with numbers that inspired terror against the cities of\r\nSyria. [Sidenote: A.D. 162 (a.u. 915)] Lucius, accordingly, on coming to\r\nAntioch collected a great many soldiers, and with the best commanders\r\nunder his supervision took up a position in the city, spending his time in\r\nordering all arrangements and in gathering the contingent for the war. He\r\nentrusted the armies themselves to Cassius. The latter made a noble stand\r\nagainst the attack [Sidenote: A.D. 165 (a.u. 918)] of Vologaesus, and\r\nfinally the chieftain was deserted by his allies and began to retire; then\r\nCassius pursued him as far as Seleucia and destroyed it and razed to the\r\nground the palace of Vologaesus at Ctesiphon. In the course of his return\r\nhe lost a great many soldiers through famine and disease, yet he started\r\noff to Syria with the men that were left. Lucius attained glory by these\r\nexploits and felt a just pride in them, yet his extreme good fortune did\r\nhim no good. [Sidenote: A.D. 169 (a.u. 922)] For he is said to have\r\nsubsequently plotted against his father-in-law Marcus and to have perished\r\nby poison before he could accomplish anything.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFragments of Dio from Suidas (thought by de Valois to belong to Book\r\nLXXI).\r\n\r\n[Martius Verus sends out Thucydides to conduct Sohaemus into Armenia; and\r\nhe, in spite of lack of arms, applied himself sturdily to this distant\r\ntask with the inherent good sense that he showed in all business falling\r\nto his lot. Marcus had the gift not only of overpowering his antagonists\r\nor anticipating them by swiftness or outwitting them by deceit (on which\r\nqualities generals most rely), but also of persuading them by trustworthy\r\npromises and conciliating them by generous gifts and luring them on by\r\ntempting hopes. He was suave in all that he did or said, and soothed the\r\nvexed and angry feelings of each adversary while greatly raising his\r\nhopes. He knew well the right time for flattery and presents and\r\nentertainment at table. And since in addition to these talents he showed\r\npersistency in endeavor and activity together with speed against his foes,\r\nhe made it plain to the barbarians that his friendship was better worth\r\ngaining than his enmity. So when he arrived at the New city, which a\r\ngarrison of Romans placed there by Priscus was occupying, and found them\r\nattempting mutiny, he took care, both by word and by deed, to bring them\r\nto a better temper, and he made the city the foremost of Armenia.]\r\n\r\n[* * _Bridging_.--By the Romans the streams and rivers are bridged\r\nwith the greatest ease, since the soldiers are always practicing at it,\r\nand it is carried on like any other warlike exercise on the Ister and the\r\nRhine and the Euphrates. The manner of doing it (which I think not\r\neverybody knows) is as follows. The boats, by means of which the river is\r\nbridged, are flat. They are anchored up stream a little above the spot\r\nwhere the bridge is to be constructed. When the signal is given, they\r\nfirst let one ship drift down stream close to the bank that they are\r\nholding. When it has come opposite the spot to be bridged, they throw into\r\nthe water a basket filled with stones and fastened with a cord, which\r\nserves as an anchor. Made fast in this way the ship is joined to the bank\r\nby planks and bridgework, which the vessel carries in large quantities,\r\nand immediately a floor is laid to the farther edge. Then they release\r\nanother ship at a little distance from this one and another one after that\r\nuntil they run the bridge to the opposite bank. The boat which is near the\r\nhostile side carries also towers upon it and a gate and archers and\r\ncatapults.\r\n\r\nAs many weapons were hurled at the men engaged in bridging, Cassius\r\nordered weapons and catapults to be discharged. And when the front rank of\r\nthe barbarians fell, the rest gave way.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 172 (a.u. 925)] [Sidenote:--3--] Cassius, however, was\r\nbidden by Marcus to have the superintendence of all Asia. The emperor\r\nhimself fought for a long time, in fact almost his whole life, one might\r\nsay, with the barbarians in the Ister region, the Iazyges and the\r\nMarcomani, first one and then the other, and he used Pannonia as his\r\nstarting point.\r\n\r\nThe Langobardi and the Obii [Footnote: Or perhaps _Osi_.] to the\r\nnumber of six thousand crossed the Ister, but the cavalry under Vindex\r\n[Footnote: _M. Macrinius Avitus Catonius Vindex_.] marched out and\r\nthe infantry commanded by Candidus got the start of them, so that an utter\r\nrout of the barbarians was instituted. The barbarians, thrown into\r\nconsternation by such an outcome of their very first undertaking,\r\ndespatched as envoys to the headquarters of Iallius Bassus [Footnote:\r\n_M. Iallius Bassus_.] (administrator of Pannonia) Bellomarius [Footnote:\r\nOr perhaps _Badomarius_.], king of the Marcomani, and ten more, for\r\nthey selected one man per nation. The envoys took oaths to cement the\r\npeace and departed homewards.\r\n\r\nMany of the Celtae, too, across the Rhine, advanced to the confines of\r\nItaly and inflicted much serious harm upon the Romans. They, in turn, were\r\nfollowed up by Marcus, who opposed to them the lieutenants Pompeianus and\r\nPertinax. Pertinax, who later became emperor, greatly distinguished\r\nhimself. Among the corpses of the barbarians were found also the bodies of\r\nwomen in armor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 168(?)] Yet, when a most violent struggle and brilliant\r\nvictory had taken place, the emperor nevertheless refused the petition of\r\nthe soldiers for money, making this statement: \"Whatever excess they\r\nobtain above the customary amount will be wrung from the blood of their\r\nparents and their kinsmen. For respecting the fate of the empire Heaven\r\nalone can decide.\"--And he ruled them so temperately and firmly that even\r\nin the course of so many and great wars he was impelled neither by\r\nflattery nor by fear to do aught that was unfitting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 172 (a.u. 925)] After conquering them\r\nMarcus received the title of Germanicus. We give the name \"Germans\" to\r\nthose who dwell in the northern regions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--4--] The so-called Bucoli began a disturbance in Egypt, and\r\nunder the leadership of Isidorus, a priest, [Footnote: Omitting [Greek:\r\nkai].] caused the rest of the Egyptians to revolt. They had first, arrayed\r\nin women's garments, deceived the Roman centurion, making him think that\r\nthey were Bucoli women and wanted to give him gold pieces in exchange for\r\ntheir husbands, and then striking him down when he approached them. His\r\ncompanion they sacrificed, and after taking a common oath over his\r\nentrails they devoured them. Isidorus surpassed in bribery all his\r\ncontemporaries. Next, having conquered the Romans in Egypt in regular\r\nbattle they came very near capturing Alexandria, and would have done so,\r\nhad not Cassius been sent against them from Syria as directing general. He\r\nsucceeded in spoiling the concord that existed among them and sundering\r\nthem one from another, for on account of their numbers and desperation he\r\nhad not ventured to attack them united. So when they fell into factional\r\ndisputes he easily subdued them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--5--] Now it was in Marcus's war against the Germans (if\r\nmention ought to be made of these matters), that a captive lad on being\r\nasked some questions by him rejoined: \"I can not answer you because of the\r\ncold. So if you want to find out anything, command that a coat be given\r\nme, if you have one.\"--And a soldier one night, who was doing guard duty\r\non the Ister, hearing a shout of his fellow-soldiers in captivity on the\r\nother side, at once swam the stream just as he was, released them, and\r\nbrought them back.\r\n\r\nOne prefect of Marcus's was Bassaeus Rufus, a good man on the whole, but\r\nuneducated and boorish, having been brought up in poverty in his early\r\nyouth. [Wherefore he had been disinclined to go on the campaign, and what\r\nMarcus said was incomprehensible to him.] Once some one had interrupted\r\nhim in the midst of trimming a vine that wound about a tree, and when he\r\ndid not come down at the first bidding, the person rebuked him, and said:\r\n\"Come down there, prefect.\" This he said thinking to humiliate him for his\r\nprevious haughtiness; yet later Fortune gave him this title to wear.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--6--] The emperor, as often as he had leisure from war, held\r\ncourt and used to order that a most liberal supply of water be measured\r\nout for the speakers. [Footnote: This refers to the contrivance known as\r\nthe clepsydra or water-clock, which measured time by the slow dropping of\r\nwater from an upper into a lower vessel, somewhat on the plan of the\r\nhour-glass.] He made inquiries and answers of greater length, so that\r\nexact justice was ensured by every possible expedient. When thus engaged\r\nhe would often hold court to try the same case for eleven or even twelve\r\ndays and sometimes [Sidenote: A.D. 172 (a.u. 926)] at night. He was\r\nindustrious and applied himself diligently to all the duties of his\r\noffice; and there was nothing which he said or wrote or did that he\r\nregarded a minor matter, but sometimes he would consume whole days on the\r\nfinest point, putting into practice his belief that the emperor should do\r\nnothing hurriedly. For he thought that if he should slight even the\r\nsmallest detail, it would bring him reproach that would overshadow all his\r\nother achievements. Yet he was so frail in body that at first he could not\r\nendure the cold, but when the soldiers had already come together in\r\nobedience to orders he would retire before speaking a word to them; and he\r\ntook but very little food always, and that at night. It was never his\r\ncustom to eat during the daytime unless it were some of the drug called\r\ntheriac. [Footnote: See Galen, On Antidotes, Book Two, chapter 17, and On\r\nTheriac (to Piso), chapter 2.] This drug he took not so much because he\r\nfeared anything as because his stomach and chest were in bad condition.\r\nAnd it is related that this practice enabled him to endure the disease as\r\nwell as other hardships.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 172(?) 173(?)] [Sidenote:--7--] The Iazyges were conquered\r\nby the Romans on land at this time and subsequently on the river. By this\r\nI mean not that any naval battle took place, but that the Romans followed\r\nthem as they fled over the frozen Ister and fought there as on dry land.\r\nThe Iazyges, perceiving that they were being pursued, awaited the foe's\r\nonset, expecting easily to overcome them, since their opponents were not\r\naccustomed to ice. Accordingly, some of the barbarians dashed straight at\r\nthem, while others rode around to attack the flanks, for their horses were\r\ntrained to run safely even over a surface of this kind. The Romans, seeing\r\nthis, were not alarmed, but made a close formation, placing themselves so\r\nas to face all of them at once. The majority laid down their shields and\r\nresting one foot upon them, so that they might slip less, received the\r\nenemy's assault. Some seized bridles, others shields and spear-shafts, and\r\ndrew them towards them. Then, becoming involved in close conflict, they\r\nknocked down both men and horses, for on account of their momentum the\r\nenemy could not help slipping. The Romans also slipped down: but in case\r\none of them fell on his back he dragged his adversary down on top of him\r\nand then by winding his legs about him as in a wrestling match would get\r\nhim underneath; and if one fell on his face, he made his opponent fall\r\nbefore he did, also on his face. The barbarians, being unused to a contest\r\nof this sort, and having lighter equipment, were unable to resist, so that\r\nbut few escaped out of a large force.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 174 (a.u. 927)] [Sidenote:--8--] So Marcus made the\r\nMarcomani and Iazyges subservient by a series of great struggles and\r\ndangers. A great war against the so-called Quadi also fell to his lot and\r\nit was his good fortune to win an unexpected victory, or rather it was\r\ngiven him from Heaven. At a time when the Romans had run into danger in\r\nthe battle the Heavenly Power most unexpectedly saved them. The Quadi had\r\nsurrounded them at an opportune spot and the Romans were fighting\r\nvaliantly with their shields locked together: and the barbarians ceased\r\nfighting, expecting to capture their enemies easily by heat and thirst. So\r\nthey posted guards all about and hemmed them in to prevent their getting\r\nwater anywhere, for the barbarians were far superior in numbers. The\r\nRomans fell into dire distress from their fatigue and wounds and the sun's\r\nheat and their thirst, and for these reasons could neither fight nor march\r\nin any direction but were standing and being scorched in line of battle\r\nand at their several posts, when suddenly numbers of clouds rushed\r\ntogether and a great rain, certainly of divine origin, came pouring down.\r\nIndeed, there is a story that Arnouphis, an Egyptian wizard, who was a\r\ncompanion of Marcus, invoked by means of enchantments various deities and\r\nin particular Mercury, god of the air, and by this means attracted the\r\nrain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--9--] This is what Dio says about it, but he seems to be\r\ntelling an untruth, whether voluntarily or involuntarily; I am more\r\ninclined to think it is voluntarily. It surely must be so, for he was not\r\nignorant of the fact that one company of the soldiers had the special name\r\nof \"The Thunderbolt\" (he mentions it in the list along with the rest),\r\n[Footnote: The reference is evidently to Book Fifty-five, chapter 23, but\r\nit should be observed that the names, though very possibly having the same\r\nsense, are not identical. The legion is here called [Greek: keraunobolos]\r\n(=Fulminatrix or Fulminata) but in 55, 23 [Greek: keraunophoros] (=\r\nFulminifera).] and this was due to no other cause (nor is any other\r\nreported) save that event which gave rise to the title in this very\r\nwar,--an event which enabled the Romans to survive on this occasion and\r\nbrought destruction upon the barbarians. It was not Arnouphis, the wizard,\r\nfor Marcus is not accounted to have taken pleasure in the company of\r\nwizards and charms. But what I have reference to is as follows: Marcus had\r\na company (and the Roman name for company is \"legion\") of soldiers from\r\nMelitene. They were all worshipers of Christ. Now it is stated that in\r\nthat battle, when Marcus was in a quandary over having been surrounded and\r\nfeared the loss of his whole army, the prefect approached him and said\r\nthat those called Christians can accomplish anything whatever by their\r\nprayers, and that among them there chanced to be a whole company of this\r\nsect. Marcus, on hearing this, made an appeal to them to pray to their\r\nGod. And when they had prayed, the God immediately gave ear, hurling a\r\nthunderbolt upon the enemy and encouraging the Romans with rain. Marcus\r\nwas astounded at what happened and honored the Christians by an official\r\ndecree, while the legion he named \"The Thunderbolt.\" It is said also that\r\nthere is a letter of Marcus extant on this matter. But the Greeks, though\r\nthey know that the company was called \"Thunderbolt\" and bear witness to\r\nthe fact themselves, make no statement whatever about the reason for the\r\nappellation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--10--] Dio goes on to say that when the rain poured down at\r\nfirst all bent their faces upwards and received it in their mouths. Then\r\nsome held their shields and their helmets as pails, and they themselves\r\ntook fullmouthed draughts of it and gave their horses to drink. The\r\nbarbarians making a charge upon them, they drank and fought at the same\r\ntime; and some who were wounded gulped down together the water and the\r\nblood that flowed into their helmets. The most of them had given so much\r\nattention to drinking that they would have suffered some great damage from\r\nthe enemy's onset had not a violent hail and numbers of thunderbolts\r\nfallen upon the latter's ranks. In the same spot one might see water and\r\nfire descending from Heaven at the same time: the one side was being\r\ndrenched and drinking, the other was being burned with fire and dying. The\r\nfire did not touch the Romans, but if it fell anywhere among them it was\r\nstraightway extinguished. On the other hand, the shower did the barbarians\r\nno good, but like oil served rather to feed the flames that fed on them,\r\nand they searched for water while in the midst of rain. Some wounded\r\nthemselves in the attempt to put out the fire with blood, and others ran\r\nover to the side of the Romans, convinced that they alone had the saving\r\nwater. Marcus finally took pity on them. He was for the seventh time\r\nsaluted as imperator by the soldiers. And although he was not wont to\r\naccept any such honor before the senate voted it, [Footnote: Cp. Mommsen,\r\n_Staatsrecht_, 12, p. 123 (or 13, p. 124); also III, p. 1108.]\r\nnevertheless this time he took it under the assumption that it was\r\nbestowed from Heaven, and he sent a despatch to that effect to the\r\nsenate.--Moreover Faustina was named \"Mother of the Legions.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--11--] [Marcus [Antoninus] remained in Pannonia in order to\r\ntransact business with the embassies of the barbarians. Many came to him\r\nalso at this time. Some promised an alliance: they were led by Battarius,\r\na child twelve years old, and they received money and succeeded in\r\nrestraining Tarbus, a neighboring potentate, who had come into Dacia, was\r\ndemanding money, and threatening to make war if he should not get it.\r\nOthers, like the Quadi, were asking for peace, and they obtained it, the\r\nemperor's purpose being to have them detached from the Marcomani. Another\r\nreason was that they gave horses and cattle, surrendered all the deserters\r\nand the captives at first to the number of thirteen thousand, though later\r\nthey promised to restore the remainder as well. However, the right of free\r\nintercourse even at markets was not granted them, the intention being to\r\nprevent the Iazyges and the Marcomani, whom they had sworn not to receive\r\nnor let pass through their country, from either mingling with them or\r\npresenting themselves also in the guise of Quadi,--a plan which would\r\nenable them to reconnoitre the Roman position and to purchase provisions.\r\nBesides these who came to Marcus, many others despatched envoys, some by\r\ntribes and some by nations, offering to surrender themselves. Some of them\r\nwere sent on campaigns to other parts of the world, and the captives and\r\ndeserters who were fit for it were similarly treated. Others received\r\nland, in Dacia or in Pannonia or in Moesia and Germany or in Italy itself.\r\nA few of them who settled at Ravenna made an uprising and even dared to\r\ntake possession of the city: and for this reason he did not again bring\r\nany barbarian into Italy, but made even those who had previously come\r\nthere find homes outside.]\r\n\r\nDetachments of both Astingi and Lacringi had come to lend assistance to\r\nMarcus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--12--] [The Astingi, whose leaders were Raus and Raptus, came\r\ninto Dacia to settle, in the hope of receiving both money and land in\r\nreturn for terms of alliance. As they did not obtain this, they put their\r\nwives and children in the keeping of Clemens, [Footnote: _Sex. Cornelius\r\nClemens._] with the apparent intention of acquiring the land of the\r\nCostobocci by force of arms; and upon conquering them they injured Dacia\r\nno less. The Lacringi, fearing that Clemens out of dread might lead these\r\nnewcomers into the land which they were inhabiting, attacked them off\r\ntheir guard and won a decisive victory. As a result, the Astingi committed\r\nno further deeds displaying hostility to the Romans, but by making urgent\r\nsupplication to Marcus received money from him and asked that land might\r\nbe given them if they should harm in some way his temporary enemies. Now\r\nthese performed some of their promises. The Cotini made similar\r\npropositions, but upon getting control of Tarrutenius Paternus, secretary\r\nof the emperor's Latin letters, under the pretext of requiring his aid for\r\na campaign against the Marcomani, they not only failed to take this course\r\nbut did him frightful injury and thereby ensured their own destruction\r\nlater.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 171 (a.u. 924)] When in one battle the Marcomani were\r\nsuccessful and killed Marcus Vindex, the prefect, he erected three statues\r\nin his memory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--13--] [Envoys were also sent to Marcus by the Iazyges,\r\nrequesting peace, but they did not obtain any. For Marcus, knowing their\r\nrace to be untrustworthy, and, furthermore, because he had been deceived\r\nby the Quadi, wished to annihilate them absolutely. [Footnote: Reading\r\n[Greek: exelein] (Boissevain) in place of the MS. [Greek: exelthein].] The\r\nQuadi had not only made alliances at this time with the Iazyges, but\r\npreviously, too, were wont to receive in their own land Marcomanian\r\nfugitives who might be hard pressed, while that tribe was at war with the\r\nRomans. Nor did they do aught else that they had agreed, for they did not\r\nrestore all the captives, but only a few, and these were such as they\r\ncould not sell nor use for any work as helpers. And whenever they did give\r\nback any of those in good condition, they would keep their relatives at\r\nhome in order that the men given up might desert again to join their\r\nfriends. They also expelled their king, Furtius, and on their own\r\nresponsibility made Ariogaesus king instead. Consequently the emperor did\r\nnot confirm him, since he had not been legally installed, nor renew the\r\ntreaty of peace, though they promised to return fifty thousand captives if\r\nhe would.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--14--] [Against Ariogaesus Marcus was so bitter that he issued\r\na proclamation to the effect that any one who would bring him alive should\r\nreceive a thousand gold pieces, and any one who killed him and exhibited\r\nhis head, five hundred. Yet in other cases this emperor was always\r\naccustomed to treat even his most stubborn foes humanely; for instance, he\r\ndid not kill, but merely sent to Britain Tiridates, a satrap who roused a\r\ntumult in Armenia and the person who slew the king of the Heniochi and\r\nthen held the sword in Verus's [Footnote: _P. Martius Verus._] face,\r\nwhen the latter rebuked him for it. This, then, shows the extent of his\r\nirritation against Ariogaesus at the time. However, when the man was later\r\ncaptured he did him no harm, but sent him away to Alexandria.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 174(?) 175(?)] When Pertinax in\r\nconsideration of his brave exploits obtained the consulship, there were\r\nnevertheless some who showed displeasure at the fact that he was of\r\nobscure family, and quoted the line from tragedy:\r\n\r\n  \"Such things the wretched war brings in its train.\" [Footnote: From\r\n  Euripides, The Suppliants, verse 119.]\r\n\r\nThey did not know that he should yet be sovereign.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 176(?)] [Sidenote:--15--] [At the request of the\r\nMarcomani, as expressed by their envoys and in view of the fact that they\r\nhad followed all the injunctions laid upon them, even if sullenly and\r\nhesitatingly, he released to them one half of the adjoining territory, so\r\nthat they could settle for a distance of about thirty-eight stades\r\n[Footnote: Or five miles.] from the Ister, and established the places and\r\nthe days for their meeting together (these had not been previously\r\ndetermined), and he exchanged hostages with them.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 175 (a.u. 928)] [Sidenote:--16--] [The Iazyges, also, when\r\nthey had experienced reverses, came to an agreement, Zanticus himself\r\nappearing as suppliant before Antoninus. Previously they had imprisoned\r\nBanadaspus, their second king, for making proposals to him. Now, however,\r\nall the foremost men came in company with Zanticus and made the same\r\ncompact as that accepted by the Quadi and the Marcomani, except in so far\r\nas they were required [Footnote: Reading [Greek: aemellon] (Boissevain).]\r\nto dwell twice as far away from the Ister as those tribes. It was his wish\r\nto root them out utterly. That they were still strong at this time and\r\ncould have done the Romans great harm is evident from the fact that they\r\ngave back one hundred thousand captives out of a body in which many had\r\nbeen sold, many were dead, and many had run away and been recaptured. They\r\nsupplied Antoninus at once with a cavalry force of eight thousand allies,\r\nfifty-five hundred of whom he sent to Britain.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--17--] [The revolt of Cassius and Syria forced Marcus\r\nAntoninus, even contrary to his wishes, to come to terms with the Iazyges.\r\nHe was so upset at the news that he did not even communicate to the senate\r\nthe basis of the reconciliation made with them, as he was wont to do in\r\nall other cases.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 179-180]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--18--] [The Iazyges sent an embassy and asked to be released\r\nfrom some of the agreements they had made, and a certain leniency was\r\nshown them, to prevent their being entirely alienated. Yet neither they\r\nnor the Buri were willing to join the Roman alliance until they received\r\npledges from Marcus that he would without fail prosecute the war to the\r\nuttermost. They were afraid that he might make a treaty with the Quadi, as\r\nbefore, and leave enemies dwelling at their doors.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--19--] [Marcus gave audience to such persons as came in the\r\ncapacity of envoys from outside nations, but all were not received on the\r\nsame footing. This varied according as the individual states were worthy\r\nto receive citizenship, or freedom from taxes, or perpetual or temporary\r\nexemption from tribute, or to enjoy permanent support. And when the\r\nIazyges proved themselves most useful to him, he released them from many\r\nof the restrictions imposed upon them,--indeed, from all, save from the\r\narrangements made in regard to their gatherings and mutual intercourse,\r\nand the provisions that they should _not_ use boats of their own and\r\n_should_ keep away from the islands in the Ister. And he permitted\r\nthem to go through Dacia and have dealings with the Rhoxolani as often as\r\nthe governor of Dacia would give them permission.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--20--] [The Quadi and the Marcomani sent envoys to Marcus,\r\nsaying that the two myriads of soldiers that were in the forts would not\r\nallow [Footnote: Supplying, with Reiske, [Greek: epetrepon.]] them to\r\npasture or till the soil or do anything else with freedom, but kept\r\nreceiving many deserters from them and captives of theirs; yet the\r\nsoldiers themselves were enduring no great hardships, inasmuch as they had\r\nbath-houses and all necessary provisions in abundance. The Quadi,\r\nconsequently, would not endure the watch kept on them from fortifications\r\nand undertook to withdraw _en masse_ to the territory of the\r\nSemnones. But Antoninus learned beforehand of their intention and by\r\nbarring the roads thither prevented them. This showed that he desired not\r\nto acquire their territory, but to punish the members of the tribe.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--21--] [And the Naristi, having encountered hardships, deserted\r\nto the number of three thousand at once and received land in our\r\nterritory.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--22--] Upon the rebellion of Cassius in Syria, Marcus, in great\r\nalarm, summoned his son Commodus from Rome, since he was now able to enter\r\nthe ranks of the iuvenes. Now Cassius, who was a Syrian from Cyrrhus, had\r\nshown himself an excellent man and the sort of person one would desire to\r\nhave as emperor: only he was a son of one Heliodorus, [Footnote: _C.\r\nAvidius Heliodorus_ (cp. Book Sixty-nine, chapter 3).] who had been\r\ndelighted to secure the governorship of Egypt as a result of his\r\noratorical skill. But in this uprising he made a terrible mistake, and it\r\nwas all due to his having been deceived by Faustina. The latter, who was a\r\ndaughter of Antoninus Pius, seeing that her husband had fallen ill, and\r\nexpecting that he might die at any moment, was afraid that the imperial\r\noffice might revert to some outsider and she be left in private life; for\r\nCommodus was both young and rather callow, besides. So she secretly\r\ninduced Cassius to make preparations to the end that if anything should\r\nhappen to Antoninus he might take both her and the sovereignty.\r\n[Sidenote:--23--] Now while he was in this frame of mind, a message came\r\nthat Marcus was dead (in such circumstances reports always make matters\r\nworse than they really are) and immediately, without waiting to confirm\r\nthe rumor, he laid claim to the empire on the ground that it had been\r\nbestowed upon him by the soldiers at this time quartered in Pannonia. And\r\nin spite of the fact that before long he learned the truth, nevertheless,\r\nsince he had once made a move, he would not change his attitude but\r\nspeedily won over the whole district bounded by the Taurus, and was making\r\npreparations to maintain his ascendancy by war. Marcus, on being informed\r\nof his uprising by Verus, the governor of Cappadocia, for a time concealed\r\nit; but, as the soldiers were being mightily disturbed by the reports and\r\nwere doing a deal of talking, he called them together and read an address\r\nof the following nature:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--24--] \"Fellow-soldiers, I have not come before you to express\r\nindignation, nor yet in a spirit of lamentation. Why rage against Fate,\r\nthat is all-powerful? But perchance it is needful to bewail the lot of\r\nthose who are undeservedly unfortunate, a lot which is now mine. Is it not\r\nafflicting for us to meet war after war? Is it not absurd to be involved\r\nin civil conflict? Are not both these conditions surpassed in affliction\r\nand in absurdity by the proof before us that there is naught to be trusted\r\namong mankind, since I have been plotted against by my dearest friend and\r\nhave been thrust into a conflict against my will, though I have committed\r\nno crime nor even error? What virtue, what friendship shall henceforth be\r\ndeemed secure after this experience of mine? Has not faith, has not hope\r\nperished? If the danger were mine alone, I should give the matter no\r\nheed,--I was not born to be immortal,--but since there has been a public\r\nsecession (or rather obsession) and war is fastening its clutches upon all\r\nof us alike, I should desire, were it possible, to invite Cassius here and\r\nargue the case with him in your presence or in the presence of the senate;\r\nand I would gladly, without a contest, withdraw from my office in his\r\nfavor, if this seemed to be for the public advantage. For it is on behalf\r\nof the public that I continue to toil and undergo dangers and have spent\r\nso much time yonder outside of Italy, during mature manhood and now in old\r\nage and weakness, though I can not take food without pain nor get sleep\r\nfree from anxiety.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--25--] \"But since Cassius would never be willing to agree to\r\nthis (for how could he trust me after having shown himself so\r\nuntrustworthy towards me?), you, at least, fellow-soldiers, ought to be of\r\ngood cheer. Cilicians, Syrians, Jews and Egyptians have never proved your\r\nsuperiors nor shall so prove, even if they assemble in numbers ten times\r\nyour own, whereas they are now by the same proportion inferior. Nor yet\r\nwould Cassius himself now appear worthy of any particular consideration,\r\nhowever much he may seem to possess the qualities of generalship, however\r\nmany successes he may seem to have gained. An eagle is not formidable at\r\nthe head of an army of daws, nor a lion commanding fawns; and it was not\r\nCassius, but you, that brought to an end the Arabian or the famous\r\nParthian War. Again, even though he is renowned as a result of his\r\nachievements against the Parthians, yet you have Verus, who has won more\r\nvictories than he and has acquired more territory in a not less, but more\r\ndistinguished manner.--But probably he has already changed his mind, on\r\nhearing that I am alive, for surely he has done this on no other\r\nassumption than that I was dead. And if he resists still further, yet when\r\nhe learns that we are approaching, he will surely hesitate both out of\r\nfear of you and out of respect for me.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--26--] \"There is only one thing I fear, fellow-soldiers (you\r\nshall be told the whole truth), and that is that he may either kill\r\nhimself because ashamed to come into our presence, or some one else upon\r\nlearning that I shall come and am setting out against him may do it. Then\r\nshould I be deprived of a great prize both of war and of victory, and of a\r\nmagnitude such as no human being ever yet obtained. What is this? Why, to\r\nforgive a man that has done you an injury, to remain a friend to one who\r\nhas transgressed friendship, to continue faithful to one who has broken\r\nfaith. Perhaps this seems strange to you, but you ought not to disbelieve\r\nit. For all goodness has not yet perished from among mankind, but there is\r\nstill in us a remnant of the ancient virtue. And if any one does\r\ndisbelieve it, that renders the more ardent my desire that men may see\r\naccomplished what no one would believe could come to pass. That would be\r\none profit I could derive from present ills, if I could settle the affair\r\nwell and show to all mankind that there is a right way to handle even\r\ncivil wars.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--27--] This is what Marcus both said to the soldiers and wrote\r\nto the senate, in no place abusing Cassius, save he constantly termed him\r\nungrateful. Nor, indeed, did Cassius ever utter or write anything of a\r\nnature insulting to Marcus.\r\n\r\nMarcus at the time he was preparing for the war against Cassius would\r\naccept no barbarian alliance although he found a concourse of foreign\r\nnations offering their services; for he said that the barbarians ought not\r\nto know about troubles arising between Romans.\r\n\r\nWhile Marcus was making preparations for the civil war, many victories\r\nover various barbarians were reported at one and the same time with the\r\ndeath of Cassius. The latter while walking had encountered Antonius, a\r\ncenturion, who gave him a sudden wound in the neck, though the blow was\r\nnot entirely effective. And Antonius, borne away by the impetus of his\r\nhorse, left the deed incomplete, so that his victim nearly escaped; but\r\nmeantime the decurion had finished what was left to do. They cut off his\r\nhead and set out to meet the emperor.\r\n\r\nMarcus Antoninus [was so much grieved at the destruction\r\nof Cassius that he would not even endure to see the severed head, but\r\nbefore the murderers drew near gave orders that it should be buried.]\r\n\r\nThus was this pretender slain after a dream of\r\nsovereignty lasting three months and six days, and his son was murdered\r\nsomewhere else. And Marcus upon reaching the provinces that had joined in\r\nCassius's uprising treated them all very kindly and put no one, either\r\nobscure or prominent, to death.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--28--] [The same man would not slay nor imprison nor did he put\r\nunder any guard any one of the senators associated with Cassius. He did\r\nnot so much as bring them before his own court, but merely sent them\r\nbefore the senate, nominally under some other complaint, and appointed\r\nthem a fixed day on which to have their case heard. Of the rest he brought\r\nto justice a very few, who had not only cooperated with Cassius to the\r\nextent of some overt action but were personally guilty of some crime. A\r\nproof of this is that he did not murder nor deprive of his property\r\nFlavius Calvisius, the governor of Egypt, but merely confined him on an\r\nisland. The records made about his case Marcus caused to be burned, in\r\norder that no reproach might attach to him from them. Furthermore he\r\nreleased all his relatives.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 176 (a.u. 929)] [Sidenote:--29--] About this same time\r\nFaustina died, either of the gout from which she had suffered or from less\r\nnatural causes and to avoid being convicted of her compact with\r\nCassius.--Moreover, Marcus destroyed the documents [found in the chests of\r\nPudens], [Footnote: Reimar suggested that perhaps Pudens was secretary of\r\nthe Greek letters of Cassius, as Manlius (Book Seventy-two, chapter 7) was\r\nof his Latin letters.] not even reading them, in order that he might not\r\nlearn even a name of any of the conspirators who had written something\r\nagainst him and that he might not [therefore] be reluctantly forced to\r\nhate any one. Another account is that Verus, who was sent ahead into\r\nSyria, of which he had secured the governorship, found them among the\r\neffects of Cassius and put them out of the way, saying that this course\r\nwould most probably be agreeable to the emperor, but even if he should be\r\nangry, it would be better that he [Verus] himself should perish than many\r\nothers. Marcus was so averse to slaughter that he saw to it that the\r\ngladiators in Rome contended without danger, like athletes; for he never\r\npermitted any of them to have any sharp iron, but they fought with blunt\r\nweapons, rounded off at the ends. [And so far was he from countenancing\r\nany slaughter that though at the request of the populace he ordered to be\r\nbrought in a lion trained to eat men, he would not look at the beast nor\r\nemancipate its teacher, in spite of the long-continued and urgent demands\r\nof the people. Instead, he commanded proclamation to be made that the man\r\nhad done nothing to deserve freedom.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--30--] In his great grief over the death of Faustina he wrote\r\nto the senate that no one of those who had cooperated with Cassius was\r\ndead, as if in this fact alone he could find some consolation for\r\nFaustina's loss. \"May it never happen,\" he continued, \"that any one of you\r\nis slain during [Footnote: Reading [Greek: ep emou] (Dindorf).] my\r\nlifetime either by my vote or by your own.\" Finally he said: \"If I do not\r\nobtain this request, I shall hasten on to death.\" So pure and excellent\r\nand godfearing did he show himself throughout his career. [Nothing could\r\nforce him to do anything inconsistent with his character, neither the\r\nwickedness of daring attempts nor the expectation of similar events to\r\nfollow as the result of pardon. To such an extent did he refrain from\r\ninventing any imaginary conspiracy and concocting any tragedy that had not\r\ntaken place, that he released even those who most openly rose against him\r\nand took arms against him and against his son, whether they were generals\r\nor heads of tribes or kings, and he put none of them to death either by\r\nhis own action or by that of the senate or by any other arrangement\r\nwhatever. Wherefore I actually believe that if he had captured Cassius\r\nhimself alive, he would certainly have saved him from injury.] For he\r\nconferred benefits upon many who had been murderers,--so far as lay in\r\ntheir power,--of himself and his son.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--31--] A law was at this time passed that no one should be\r\ngovernor in the province from which he had originally come, because the\r\nrevolt of Cassius had occurred during his administration of Syria, which\r\nincluded his native district. It was voted by the senate that silver\r\nimages of Marcus and Faustina should be set up in the temple of Venus and\r\nRoma, and that an altar should be erected whereon all the maidens married\r\nin the city and their bridegrooms should offer sacrifice; also that a\r\ngolden image of Faustina should be carried in a chair to the theatre on\r\neach occasion that the emperor should be a spectator, and that it should\r\nbe placed in the seat well forward, where she herself was wont to take her\r\nplace when alive, and that the women of chief influence should all sit\r\nround about it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--32--] Marcus went to Athens, where after being initiated into\r\nthe mysteries he bestowed honors upon the Athenians and gave teachers to\r\nall men in Athens, for every species of knowledge, these teachers to\r\nreceive an annual salary. On his return to Rome he made an address to the\r\npeople; and while he was saying, among other things, that he had been\r\nabsent many years, they cried out: \"Eight!\" and indicated this also with\r\ntheir hands, in order that they might receive an equal number of gold\r\npieces for a banquet. He smiled and himself uttered the word \"Eight.\"\r\nAfter that he distributed to them two hundred denarii apiece, more than\r\nthey had ever received before.--In addition to doing this, he forgave all\r\npersons all their debts to the imperial and to the public treasury for a\r\nspace of forty-six years, outside of the sixteen granted by Hadrian. And\r\nall the documents relating to these debts he ordered burned in the Forum.\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 177 (a.u. 930)]--He gave money to many cities, one of them\r\nbeing Smyrna, that had suffered terribly by an earthquake; he also\r\nassigned the duty of building up this place to an ex-praetor of senatorial\r\nrank. Therefore I am surprised at the censures even now passed upon him to\r\nthe effect that he was not a man of large calibre. For, whereas in\r\nordinary matters he was really quite frugal, he never demurred at a single\r\nnecessary expenditure (though, as I have said, [Footnote: The reference\r\nhere made by Dio may very possibly be to a passage reproduced by Zonaras\r\n(XII, 1), regarding the authenticity of which Boissevain is nevertheless\r\nsomewhat doubtful. For the sake of completeness a translation is here\r\ngiven ([Greek: oumaen [Lacuna] ebiasato]):\r\n\r\n  \"Yet he was not thereby induced to secure money from the subject\r\n  nations. On one occasion, indeed, with wars impending, he had come short\r\n  for funds and still did not devise any new tax nor endure to ask money\r\n  from any one. Instead, he exposed in the Forum all the heirlooms of the\r\n  palace, even down to this or that piece of finery belonging to his wife,\r\n  and solicited their purchase by any person so disposed. This brought him\r\n  a store of coin, which he distributed to the soldiers. By success in the\r\n  war he gained many times the amount in question, and he issued a\r\n  proclamation to the effect than any one so disposed among the purchasers\r\n  of the imperial property might return the article purchased and receive\r\n  its value. Some did so, but the majority declined. And nobody was\r\n  compelled to restore any object thus acquired.\"]\r\n\r\nhe hurt no one by levies), and he necessarily laid out very large sums\r\nbeyond the ordinary requirements.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--33--] The Scythian imbroglio, which needed his attention,\r\ncaused him to give his son a wife, Crispina, sooner than he actually\r\nwished. The Quintilii could not end the war, although there were two of\r\nthem and they possessed prudence, courage, and considerable experience.\r\nConsequently the rulers themselves were forced to take the field.\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 178 (a.u. 931)] Marcus also asked the senate for money\r\nfrom the public treasury, not because it had not been placed in the\r\nsovereign's authority, but because Marcus was wont to declare that this\r\nand everything else belonged to the senate and the people. \"We,\" said he\r\n(speaking to the senate), \"are so far from having anything of our own that\r\nwe even live in a house of yours.\" He set out, therefore, after these\r\nremarks, and after hurling the bloody spear, that lay in the temple of\r\nBellona, into hostile territory. (I heard this from men who accompanied\r\nhim). [Sidenote: A.D. 179] Paternus was given a large detachment and sent\r\nto the scene of fighting. The barbarians held out the entire day, but were\r\nall cut down by the Romans. And Marcus was for the tenth time saluted as\r\nimperator.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 180 (a.u. 933)] Had he lived longer, he\r\nwould have subdued the whole region: as it was, he passed away on the\r\nseventeenth of March, not from the effects of the sickness that he had at\r\nthe time, but by the connivance of his physicians, as I have heard on good\r\nevidence, who wanted to do a favor to Commodus.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--34--] When at the point of death he commended his son to the\r\nprotection of the soldiers (for he did not wish his death to appear to be\r\nhis fault); and to the military tribunes, who asked him for the watchword,\r\nhe said: \"Go to the rising sun: I am already setting.\" After he was dead\r\nhe obtained many marks of honor and was set up in gold within the\r\nsenate-house itself.\r\n\r\nSo this was the manner of Marcus's demise, [who besides all other virtues\r\nwas so godfearing that even on the dies nefasti he sacrificed at home; and\r\nhe ruled better than any that had ever been in power. To be sure, he could\r\nnot display many feats of physical prowess; yet in his own person he made\r\na very strong body out of a very weak one.] Most of his life he passed in\r\nthe service of beneficence, and therefore he erected on the Capitol a\r\ntemple to that goddess and called her by a most peculiar name, which had\r\nnever before been current. [Footnote: What this name was no one knows.\r\nSylburgius conjectured that it might be _Aequanimitas_.] He himself\r\nrefrained from all offences, [and committed no faults voluntarily:] but\r\nthe offences of others, particularly those of his wife, he endured, and\r\nneither investigated them nor punished them. In case any person did\r\nanything good, he would praise him and use him for the service in which he\r\nexcelled, but about others he did not trouble himself, [saying: \"It is\r\nimpossible for one to create such men as one wishes to have, but it is\r\nproper to employ those in existence for that in which each of them may be\r\nuseful to the commonwealth.\"] That all his actions were prompted not by\r\npretence but by real virtue is strikingly clear. He lived fifty-eight\r\nyears, ten months, and twenty-two days, and of this time he had spent\r\nconsiderable as assistant to the previous Antoninus and had himself been\r\nemperor nineteen years and eleven days, yet from first to last he remained\r\nthe same and changed not a particle. So truly was he a good man, without\r\nany pretence about him. [Sidenote:--35--] He was vastly helped by his\r\neducation being an expert in rhetoric and in philosophical argument. In\r\nthe one he had Cornelius Fronto and Claudius Herodes for teachers, and in\r\nthe other, Junius Rusticus and Apollonius of Nicomedea, [Footnote: Since\r\nApollonius was really from Chalcedon, an error may here charged to Dio's\r\nor some one else's account.] both of whom followed Zeno's school. As a\r\nresult, great numbers pretended to engage in philosophy, in order that\r\nthey might be enriched by the emperor.\r\n\r\nAfter all, however, he owed his great attainments chiefly to his natural\r\ndisposition; for even before he enjoyed the society of those men he was\r\nunflinchingly set upon virtue. While still a boy he delighted all his\r\nrelations, who were numerous and influential and wealthy, and was loved by\r\nall of them. This, most of all, led Hadrian to adopt him into his family,\r\nand Marcus, for his part, did not grow haughty [but, though young and a\r\nCaesar he dutifully played the part of servant to Antoninus through all\r\nthe latter's reign and ungrudgingly did honor to the other men of\r\neminence. Before going to see his father he used to greet the most worthy\r\nmen in the house near the Tiber where he lived, and in the very apartment\r\nwhere he slept; and all this time, instead of wearing the attire allowed\r\nby his rank, he went dressed as a private citizen. He visited many who\r\nwere sick and invariably met his teachers at the proper time. Dark\r\ngarments were what he wore on going out when not in his father's company,\r\nand he never used the attendant for himself alone. Upon being appointed\r\nleader of the knights he entered the Forum with the rest, although he was\r\nCaesar. This shows how excellent was his own natural disposition, though\r\nit was aided to the greatest degree by education.] He was always steeped\r\nin Greek and Latin rhetorical and philosophical learning [though he had\r\nreached man's estate and had hopes of becoming emperor].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--36--] Before he was made Caesar he had a dream in which he\r\nseemed to have shoulders and hands of ivory and to use them in all\r\nrespects as he did his real limbs.\r\n\r\nAs a result of his great labors and studies he was extremely frail in\r\nbody, yet from the very start he enjoyed such good health that he used to\r\nfight in armor and on a hunt struck down wild boars while on horseback.\r\n[And not only in his early youth but even later he wrote most of his\r\nletters to his intimate friends with his own hand.] However, he did not\r\nmeet the good fortune that he deserved, for he was not strong [in body]\r\nand was involved in the greatest variety of troubles throughout\r\npractically the whole period that he was ruler. But I am sure I admire him\r\nall the more for this very reason, that amid unusual and extraordinary\r\nhappenings he both himself survived and preserved the empire. One thing in\r\nparticular contributed to his lack of happiness,--the fact that after\r\nrearing and educating his son in the best possible way he was monstrously\r\ndisappointed in him. This matter must now form the subject of our\r\ndiscourse, for our history now descends from a kingdom of gold to one of\r\niron and rust, [Footnote: Reading [Greek: chatiomenaen] (Dindorf,\r\nfollowing Reiske).] as affairs did for the Romans of that day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIO'S ROMAN HISTORY\r\n73\r\n\r\nAbout Commodus Augustus (chapter 1).\r\n\r\nHow Commodus made terms of peace with the Marcomani, the Quadi, and the\r\nBuri (chapters 2, 3).\r\n\r\nIntrigues of Pompeianus against Commodus (chapter 4).\r\n\r\nAbout the killing of the Quintilii (chapters 5-7).\r\n\r\nAbout the war in Britain, and the captain, Ulpius Marcellus (chapter 8).\r\n\r\nHow Perennis, pretorian prefect, was slain (chapters 9, 10)\r\n\r\nStatue erected to Victorinus (chapter 11).\r\n\r\nCrimes and death of Cleander, a Caesarian (chapters 12, 13)\r\n\r\nFresh assassinations occur (chapter 15).\r\n\r\nCommodus's titles (chapter 15).\r\n\r\nAbout the spectacles presented by Commodus, and his insolent behavior\r\n(chapters 16-21).\r\n\r\nCommodus is killed as the result of a conspiracy (chapter 22).\r\n\r\nDio begins to lay the foundations of his history (chapter 23).\r\n\r\nPortents indicating the death of Commodus (chapter 24).\r\n\r\n\r\nDURATION OF TIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nL.

His great simplicity, however, and likewise his cowardice made him a\r\nslave of his companions and it was through them that he first, out of\r\nignorance, missed the better life and then was attracted into\r\nlicentiousness and bloodthirsty habits, which soon became second nature.\r\n[And this, I think, Marcus clearly perceived beforehand.] He was nineteen\r\nyears old when his father died, leaving him many guardians, among whom\r\nwere numbered the best men of the senate. But to their suggestions and\r\ncounsels Commodus bade farewell, and, after making a truce with the\r\nbarbarians, he hastened to Rome.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--2--] [For the Marcomani by reason of the number of their\r\npeople that were perishing and the damage constantly being done to their\r\nfarms no longer had either food or men in any numbers. Thus they sent only\r\ntwo of their foremost representatives and two others that were of inferior\r\nrank as envoys in regard to peace. And whereas he might easily have put an\r\nend to their resistance, he so detested exertion and was so eager for the\r\ncomforts of city life that he made terms with them. Besides the conditions\r\nwhich his father had settled upon with them new ones were now imposed\r\nrequiring them to restore to him the deserters and the captives that they\r\ntook after this time and to contribute annually a stipulated amount of\r\ngrain,--a demand from which he subsequently released them. He obtained\r\nsome weapons from them and also soldiers, thirteen thousand from the Quadi\r\nand a smaller number from the Marcomani. In return for this contingent he\r\nrelieved them of the requirement of an annual levy. However, he issued\r\nfurther orders that they should not assemble often nor in many parts of\r\nthe country, but once each month, in one place, in the presence of a Roman\r\ncenturion; and again, that they should not make war upon the Iazyges, the\r\nBuri, or the Vandili. On these terms a reconciliation was effected and all\r\nthe garrisons in their country beyond the detached border territory were\r\nabandoned [Lacuna]]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 181(?)] [Sidenote:--3--] [Commodus also granted peace to\r\nan embassy from the Buri. Previously he would not have it, though often\r\nasked, because they were strong and because it was not peace they wanted,\r\nbut the securing of a respite for further preparations. Now, however,\r\nsince they were exhausted, he made terms with them and accepted hostages.\r\nFrom the Buri he received back many captives and from the others\r\n[Footnote: The MS. is here very possibly corrupt.] fifteen thousand, and\r\nhe compelled the others [Footnote: The MS. is here very possibly corrupt.]\r\nto take oath that they would never dwell in nor use as pasture forty\r\nstadia of their territory, nearest to Dacia. The same (?) Sabinianus also\r\nreduced twelve thousand of the neighboring Dacians who had been driven out\r\nof their own country and were on the point of aiding the rest. [Footnote:\r\nThe MS. is here very possibly corrupt.] He promised these that some land\r\nin our Dacia should be given them.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--4--] Frequent plots were formed by various persons against\r\nCommodus [for he did many reprehensible deeds] and he murdered great\r\nnumbers both of men and of women, some openly and some by secret\r\npoison,--in a word, practically all those who had attained eminence during\r\nhis father's lifetime and his own. Exceptions were Pompeianus and Pertinax\r\nand Victorinus: these for some reason unknown to me he did not kill. THIS\r\nAND WHAT FOLLOWS I STATE NOT ON THE AUTHORITY OF ANOTHER'S TRADITION, BUT\r\nFROM MY OWN OBSERVATION. On coming to Rome he had a conference with the\r\nsenate, at which he talked a great deal of nonsense, one thing that he\r\nsaid in praise of himself being that he had once on horseback saved the\r\nlife of his father, who had fallen into a deep mire. Of such a nature were\r\nhis lofty pratings. [Sidenote: A.D. 182 (a.u. 935)]As he was entering the\r\nhunting theatre, Claudius Pompeianus laid a snare for him. He held up a\r\nsword in the narrow passage which served as an entrance and said: \"See,\r\nthis is what the senate has sent you.\"\r\n\r\nThis man had taken as his spouse the daughter of Lucilla, but had intimate\r\nrelations both with the daughter herself and with the girl's mother; in\r\nthis way he had become friendly with Commodus, so that he was his\r\ncompanion at banquets and in the diversions of youth. Lucilla, who was\r\nneither more respectable nor more continent than her brother Commodus,\r\ndetested the girl's husband, Pompeianus. It was for this reason that she\r\npersuaded the aforementioned to undertake the attack upon Commodus, and\r\nshe not only caused his destruction, but was herself detected and put out\r\nof the way. Commodus killed also Crispina, because he was angry with her\r\nfor some act of adultery. Previous to their execution both women had keen\r\nbanished to the island of Capreae.\r\n\r\nThere was a certain Marcia, mistress of Quadratus (one of the men murdered\r\nat this time) and Eclectus, his cubicularius: the latter became also the\r\ncubicularius of Commodus, and the former, first, the emperor's mistress\r\nand later the wife of Eclectus; and she beheld them also perish by\r\nviolence. The tradition is that she very much favored the Christians and\r\ndid them many kindnesses, as she was enabled to do through possessing all\r\ninfluence with Commodus.\r\n\r\nCommodus killed also Julianus [Salvius, [Footnote: _P. Salvius\r\nJulianus._] and Tarrutenius Paternus, who was numbered among the\r\nexconsuls, and others with them; he furthermore put to death some woman of\r\nthe nobility. [Footnote: Vitrasia Faustina by name.] Yet Julianus after\r\nthe death of Marcus could at once have done anything at all that he\r\npleased against him, since he possessed great renown, was in charge of a\r\nlarge army, and enjoyed the devotion of his soldiers: and he refused to\r\nmake any rebellious move, both because of his own uprightness and because\r\nof the good will that he bore to Marcus, though dead. And Paternus, if he\r\nhad plotted against Commodus, as he was accused of doing, could easily\r\nhave murdered him while he himself still commanded the Pretorians; but he\r\nhad not done it.]\r\n\r\nThe emperor murdered likewise Condianus and Maximus Quintilius; for they\r\nhad a great reputation on account of education and military ability and\r\nfraternal harmony and wealth. Their notable talents led to the suspicion\r\nthat, even if they were not planning any hostile movement, still they were\r\nnot pleased with the state of affairs. Thus, even as they had lived\r\ntogether, so they died together, and one child as well. They had exhibited\r\nthe most striking example ever seen of affection for each other, and at no\r\ntime had they been divided, even in their political offices. They had\r\ngrown prosperous and exceedingly wealthy and were wont to govern together\r\nand to assist each other in trying cases at law.\r\n\r\nSextus Condianus, son of Maximus, who surpassed the generality of men in\r\ncharacter and education, when be heard that sentence of death had been\r\npassed upon him, too, drank hare's blood (he was at that time located in\r\nSyria); and after this he mounted a horse and purposely fell from it.\r\nThen, as he vomited the blood (which was supposed to be his own), he was\r\ntaken up in the expectation of his immediate demise and conveyed into a\r\ndwelling. The man himself now disappeared from view, but a ram's body was\r\nplaced in a coffin, in his place and burned. Thereafter, by constantly\r\nchanging his appearance and clothing, he wandered about, now here, now\r\nthere. And when this story was reported (for it is impossible to conceal\r\nfor a long time so weighty a matter), there was hue and cry after him in\r\nevery place, bar none. Many were punished in his stead on account of their\r\nresemblance, and many, too, who were alleged to have shared his\r\nconfidences or to have received and hidden him. Several, moreover, who had\r\nperhaps never even seen him, were deprived of their property. But no one\r\nknows whether he was really killed (though a great number of heads\r\npurporting to be his were carried to Rome) or whether he made good his\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nSome other person, after the death of Commodus, dared to assert that\r\n_he_ was Sextus and to undertake the recovery of his wealth and\r\ndignities. And he played the part well while many persons asked him\r\nnumbers of questions: when, however, Pertinax enquired of him something\r\nabout Grecian affairs, with which the real Sextus had been well\r\nacquainted, he suffered the greatest embarrassment, not being able even to\r\nunderstand what was said. [So it was that nature had made him like\r\nCondianus in form and practice like him in other ways, but he did not\r\nshare in his education.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--7--] This matter came to my own ears, and another thing that I\r\nsaw I shall now describe. There is in the city of Mallus, in Cilicia, an\r\noracle of Amphilochus, that gives responses by means of dreams. It had\r\ngiven warning also to Sextus, in a way that he indicated by a drawing. The\r\npicture that he put on a board represented a boy strangling two serpents\r\nand a lion pursuing a fawn. I was with my father, then governor of\r\nCilicia, and could not comprehend what they meant until I learned that\r\nSextus's brothers had been, as it were, strangled by Commodus (who later\r\nemulated Hercules), just as Hercules, when an infant, is related to have\r\nstrangled the serpents sent against him by Juno: similarly, the Quintilii\r\nwere hanged; I learned also that Sextus was a fugitive and was being\r\npursued by a more powerful adversary.\r\n\r\nI should render my narrative unduly irksome, were I to set down carefully\r\nevery single man put to death by this ruler,--all that he despatched\r\nbecause of false information, because of unjustified suspicions, because\r\nof notable wealth, because of distinguished family, because of unusual\r\neducation, or for any other excellence.\r\n\r\n[Commodus displayed in Rome itself many marks of wealth and very many\r\nmore, even, of love for the beautiful. Indeed, he performed one or two\r\nacts of public benefit. Manilius, a kinsman of Cassius, who had been\r\nsecretary of his Latin letters and had possessed the greatest influence\r\nwith him, was caught after a flight, but the emperor would not listen to a\r\nword of his, though he promised to lay a great deal of information, and\r\nburned all the conspirator's documents without reading them.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 184 a.u. 937] [Sidenote:--8--] He had also some wars with\r\nthe barbarians beyond Dacia, in which Albinus and Niger, who later fought\r\nthe emperor Severus, won fame, but the greatest conflict was the one in\r\nBritain. When the tribes in the island, passing beyond the wall that\r\nseparated them from the Roman legions, proceeded to commit many outrages\r\nand cut down a general, together with the soldiers that he had, Commodus\r\nwas seized with fear and sent Marcellus Ulpius against them. This man, who\r\nwas temperate and frugal and always followed strict military rules in\r\nregard to food and all other details when he was at war, became in course\r\nof time haughty and arrogant. He was conspicuously incorruptible in the\r\nmatter of bribes, but was not of a pleasant or kindly nature. He showed\r\nhimself more wakeful than any other general, and, as he desired his\r\nassociates also to be alert, he wrote orders on twelve tablets (such as\r\nare made out of linden wood) [almost] every evening, and bade a man carry\r\nthem to various persons at various hours, that they, believing the general\r\nto be always awake, might not themselves take their fill of sleep. Nature\r\nhad made him able in the first place to go without sleep and he had\r\ndeveloped this faculty a great deal more by abstinence from food. [Of\r\nscarcely anything did he eat his fill and] in order to avoid satisfying\r\nhis hunger even with bread he sent to Rome for the loaves: [this was not\r\nbecause he could not eat what was prepared in that region, but] it was\r\ndone with the purpose that the age of the article might prevent him eating\r\never so little more than what was absolutely necessary. [His gums, which\r\nwere sore, were easily made to bleed by the dryness of the bread. And he\r\nmade it his practice to affect sleeplessness even more than was the case,\r\nthat he might have a reputation for being always awake.] This was the kind\r\nof man Marcellus was, who inflicted great damage upon the barbarians in\r\nBritain. Later he narrowly escaped being destroyed by Commodus on account\r\nof his peculiar excellence, but was, nevertheless, released.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 185 (a.u. 938)] [Sidenote:--9--] Perennis, commander of\r\nthe Pretorians after Paternus, met destruction on account of a rebellion\r\nof the soldiers. For, since Commodus had devoted himself to chariot-racing\r\nand licentiousness and paid scarcely any attention to matters pertaining\r\nto the empire, Perennis was compelled to manage not only military affairs,\r\nbut everything else, and to preside over the government. The soldiers,\r\naccordingly, when anything did not go to suit them, laid the blame upon\r\nPerennis and cherished anger against him.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers in Britain chose Priscus, a lieutenant, emperor. But he\r\ndeprecated their action, saying \"I am as little suited for emperor as you\r\nare for soldiers.\"\r\n\r\nThe lieutenants in Britain had been rebuked for their turbulence (indeed,\r\nthey had not become quiet until Pertinax put a stop to their discord), and\r\nnow they chose of their number fifteen hundred javelin-slingers, whom they\r\nsent into Italy. They had approached Rome without meeting any hindrance,\r\nwhen Commodus met them and enquired: \"Why is this, fellow-soldiers? What\r\ndoes your presence signify?\" Their answer was: \"We are here because\r\nPerennis is plotting against you, and intends to make his son emperor.\"\r\nCommodus believed them, especially since Cleander dwelt at length upon the\r\npoint. (The latter was often prevented by Perennis from doing all that he\r\ndesired, and consequently entertained a bitter hatred for him). Therefore\r\nhe delivered the prefect to the soldiers of whom he was commander, and did\r\nnot venture to despise fifteen hundred men, though he had many times that\r\nnumber of Pretorians. So Perennis was abused and struck down, and his wife\r\nand sister and two sons were also killed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--10--] Thus was he slain though he deserved a far different\r\nfate both on his own account and for the interest of the entire Roman\r\ndomain. Only, it may be remarked that his fondness for office had been the\r\nchief cause of the ruin of his colleague Paternus. Privately he was never\r\nremotely concerned about either fame or wealth, but lived a most\r\nincorruptible and temperate life, and for Commodus he preserved his empire\r\nin entire safety. [For the emperor wholly followed his amusements and gave\r\nhimself over to chariot-driving and cared not a whit for any political\r\ninterests; nor, indeed, had he given his mind to the matter ever so\r\nzealously, could he have accomplished aught by reason of his luxurious\r\nliving and inexperience.]\r\n\r\nAnd the Caesarians, having got rid of this man, with Cleander at their\r\nhead entered upon every form of outrage, selling all privileges, doing\r\nviolence, plunging into licentiousness.\r\n\r\nCommodus during most of his life was given to idleness and horses and\r\nbattles of beasts and of men. Aside from his performances at home he\r\ndespatched many beasts in public and many men on many occasions. With his\r\nown hands and without assistance he gave the finishing stroke to five\r\nhippopotami at one time and to two elephants on separate days. Moreover,\r\nhe killed rhinoceroses and a camelopard. This is what I have to say in\r\ngeneral with reference to his whole career.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--11--] To Victorinus, prefect of the city, a statue was\r\ngranted. [He died not as the victim of a plot. At one time what might be\r\ncalled a loud rumor and many reports were circulating in regard to his\r\ndestruction] and, though Commodus frequently wished to get him out of the\r\nway, he still kept putting it off and shrinking from the deed until the\r\nman grew very bold, and one day approaching Perennis said: \"I hear that\r\nyou wish to kill me. Why then do you delay? Why do you put it off, when\r\nyou might do it this very day?\" [But not even this caused him to suffer\r\nany harm at the hands of any one else; it was a self-sought death that he\r\nsuffered, and the fact seems strange, inasmuch as he had been honored\r\namong the foremost men by Marcus and in mental excellence and forensic\r\neloquence stood second to none of his contemporaries. Indeed, by\r\nmentioning two incidents in his history I shall reveal his whole\r\ncharacter.]\r\n\r\nOnce, when he was governor of Germany, he at first attempted by private\r\npersuasion indoors to induce his lieutenant not to accept bribes. As the\r\nlatter would not listen to him, he mounted the tribunal and [after bidding\r\nthe herald proclaim him] took oath that he had never received bribes and\r\nnever would receive any. Next he bade his under-officer also take oath;\r\nand when this person refused to perjure himself, he ordered him to be\r\ndismissed from office. [And later as commandant of Africa he had an\r\nassociate of similar character to the man just mentioned. He did not, to\r\nbe sure, treat him in the same way, but put him aboard a boat and sent him\r\nback to Rome.] This is the kind of man Victorinus was.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--12--] As for Cleander, who after Perennis possessed greatest\r\ninfluence, he had been sold along with his fellow-slaves and had been\r\nbrought to Rome along with them for the purpose of carrying burdens. As\r\ntime went on he attained such prominence that he slept before the chamber\r\nof Commodus, married the emperor's concubine Damostratia, and put to death\r\nSaoterus of Nicomedea (who had held the position before him) besides many\r\nothers. Yet this victim had possessed very great influence, so that the\r\nNicomedeans obtained from the senate the right of holding a series of\r\ngames and of building a temple to Commodus. At any rate, Cleander, raised\r\nto greatness by the power of Fortune, granted and sold senatorships.\r\npraetorships, procuratorships, leaderships,--in a word everything. Some by\r\nexpending all that they possessed had finally become senators. It came to\r\nbe said of Julius Solon (an exceedingly obscure man) that he had been\r\ndeprived of his property and banished to the senate. [Sidenote: A.D. 189\r\n(a.u. 942)] Not only did Cleander do this, but he appointed twenty-five\r\nconsuls for one year,--something which never occurred before or after. One\r\nof those consuls was Severus, who later became emperor. The man obtained\r\nmoney, therefore, from every quarter and amassed more wealth than had ever\r\nyet belonged to those nominated cubicularii. A great deal of it he gave to\r\nCommodus and his concubines and a great deal of it he spent on houses,\r\nbaths, and other works useful to individuals and to cities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--13--] This Cleander, who had soared to so exalted a height,\r\nhimself fell suddenly and perished in dishonor. It was not the soldiers\r\nthat killed him, as they had Perennis, but the populace. There occurred a\r\nreal and pressing famine, which was increased to the utmost severity by\r\nPapirius Dionysius, the grain commissioner, in order that Cleander, whose\r\nthefts would seem as much responsible for it as any cause, might both\r\nincur hatred and suffer destruction at the hands of the Romans. So it fell\r\nout. There was a horse-race on, and as the horses were about to contend\r\nfor the seventh time a crowd of children ran into the race course, at\r\ntheir head a tall and sturdy maiden. As a result of what subsequently\r\nhappened she was deemed by people to have been a divinity. The children\r\nshouted many wild words of complaint, which the people took up again and\r\nbegan to bawl anything that came into their heads. Finally, the throng\r\njumped down and started to find Commodus (who was then in the Quintilian\r\nsuburb), invoking many blessings on his head but many curses upon\r\nCleander. The latter sent some soldiers against them, who wounded and\r\nkilled a few, but encouraged by their numbers and the strength of the\r\nPretorians they became still more urgent. They drew near to Commodus\r\nbefore information reached him from any source of what was going on. Then\r\nthe famous Marcia, wife of Quadratus, brought him the news. And Commodus\r\nwas so terrified,--he was always the veriest coward,--that he at once\r\nordered Cleander to be slain and also his child, who was in Commodus's\r\nhands to be reared. The child was dashed to the earth and perished, and\r\nthe Romans, taking the body of Cleander, dragged it away and abused it and\r\ncarried his head all about the city on a pole. They also wounded some\r\nother men who had possessed great power during his ascendancy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--14--] Commodus, taking a respite from his lusts and sports,\r\ndeveloped a taste for blood and proceeded to compass the death of\r\ndistinguished men. Among these was Julianus the prefect, whom he used to\r\nembrace and caress in public and saluted as \"father.\" Another was Julius\r\nAlexander, who was executed for having brought down a lion by a lucky cast\r\nof his javelin while on horseback. [Footnote: Boissevain suggests that the\r\n\"Roman Hercules\" perhaps feared that Alexander might diminish his glory.]\r\nThis victim, on becoming aware of the presence of his assassins, murdered\r\nthem by night and likewise put out of the way all his own enemies at\r\nEmesa, his native town. After doing this he mounted a horse and started\r\ntoward the barbarians; and he would have escaped, had he not carried a\r\nfavorite along with him. He was himself a most excellent horseman, but he\r\nwould not think of abandoning the lad, who was tired out, and so when he\r\nwas being overtaken he killed both the boy and himself. Dionysius, too,\r\nthe grain commissioner, met his death by the orders of Commodus.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a pestilence, as great as any I know, took place, for it should\r\nbe noted that two thousand persons several times died in Rome on a single\r\nday. Many more, not merely in the capital but throughout almost the entire\r\nempire, perished by the hands of scoundrels, who smeared some deadly drugs\r\non tiny needles, and, for pay, infected men with the poison by means of\r\nthese instruments. The same thing had happened before in the reign of\r\nDomitian. [Footnote: See Book Sixty-seven, chapter 11.] But the death of\r\nthese unfortunates was not regarded as of any importance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 190 (a.u. 943)] [Sidenote:--15--] Still, the effect of\r\nCommodus upon the Romans was worse than that of all pestilences and all\r\nvillanies. One feature was that whatever honors they were wont to vote to\r\nhis father out of pure regard they were compelled by fear and by strict\r\ninjunction to assign also to the son. He gave orders that Rome itself be\r\ncalled Commodiana, the legions \"Commodian,\" and the day on which this\r\nmeasure was voted \"Commodiana.\" Upon himself he bestowed, in addition to\r\nvery many other titles, that of Hercules. Rome he termed \"the Immortal,\"\r\n\"the Fortunate,\" \"the Universal Colony of the Earth\" (for he wished it to\r\nseem a settlement of his own). In his honor a gold statue was erected of a\r\nthousand pounds' weight, together with a bull and a cow. Finally, all the\r\nmonths were likewise called after him, so that they were enumerated as\r\nfollows: Amazonian, Invincible, Fortunate, Pious, Lucius, Aelius,\r\nAurelius, Commodus, August, Herculean, Roman, Transcendent. For he had\r\nassumed these different names at different times. \"Amazonian\" and\r\n\"Transcendent,\" however, he applied exclusively to himself, to indicate\r\nthat in absolutely every respect he unapproachably surpassed all mankind.\r\nSo extravagantly did the wretch rave. And to the senate he would send a\r\ndespatch couched in these terms: \"Caesar Imperator, Lucius Aelius Aurelius\r\nCommodus, Augustus, Pius, Beatus, Sarmaticus, Germanicus, Maximus,\r\nBritannicus, Peacemaker of the World, Invincible, Roman Hercules, High\r\nPriest, Holder of Tribunician Authority for the eighteenth term, Imperator\r\nfor the eighth time, Consul for the seventh time, Father of the\r\nFatherland, to consuls, praetors, tribunes and the Commodian Fortunate\r\nSenate, Greeting.\" Great numbers of statues were erected displaying him in\r\nthe garb of Hercules. And it was voted that his age should be called the\r\n\"Golden Age\" and that entries to correspond with this should in every case\r\nbe made in the records.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--16--] Now this Golden One, this Hercules, this God (such was\r\nanother designation of his) one day in the afternoon rode suddenly from\r\nthe suburbs with haste into Rome and conducted thirty horse-races in two\r\nhours. These proceedings had much to do with his running short of money.\r\nHe was also fond of bestowing gifts and frequently presented the populace\r\nwith one hundred and forty denarii apiece. But most of his expenditures\r\nwere for the objects that I have mentioned. [So it was that neither his\r\ngeneral income nor what was provided by Cleander (though incalculable in\r\namount) sufficed him, and he was compelled to bring charges against both\r\nwomen and men,--charges not serious enough for capital punishment but\r\nprolific in threats and terror.] Some of these persons he murdered, to\r\nothers he sold preservation in return for their property [and got\r\nsomething from them by constraint under the pretence that it was a\r\nvoluntary offering]. And finally on his birthday he ordered us, our wives,\r\nand our children each to contribute two aurei [a year as] a kind of\r\nfirst-fruits, and the senators in all the other cities five denarii per\r\nhead. [Of this, too, he saved not the smallest part, but spent it all\r\ndisgracefully on beasts and gladiators.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 192 (a.u. 945)] [Sidenote:--17--] In public he nowhere\r\ndrove chariots except sometimes on a moonless night. He became very\r\ndesirous to play the character also in public, but, being ashamed to be\r\nseen doing this, he kept it up constantly at home, wearing the Green\r\nuniform. Beasts, moreover, in large numbers were slaughtered at his house\r\nand many also in public. Again, he would contend as gladiator: (at home he\r\nkilled a man in this way, and, in pretending to shave others, instead of\r\ntaking off the hairs he sliced off one man's nose, another's ears, and\r\nsome other feature of a third;) but in public his contests were [Footnote:\r\nIt is just barely possible that the original gave some different idea from\r\n\"his contests were\" (cp. the text of Boissée).] minus the steel and human\r\nblood. Before entering the theatre he would put on a cleeved tonic of\r\nsilk, white interwoven with gold, and we greeted him standing there in\r\nthis attire. When he actually went in he donned a pure purple dress\r\nsprinkled with gold, assuming also a similar chlamys of Greek pattern and\r\na crown made of Indic gems and gold, and carried such a herald's staff as\r\nMercury does. The lion skin and club were carried before him along the\r\nstreets, and at the theatres were invariably placed on a gilded chair,\r\nwhether he was present or absent. He himself would enter the theatre in\r\nthe garb of Mercury, and casting off everything else begin his performance\r\nin simple tunic and unshod.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--18--] On the first day he individually killed a hundred bears\r\nby shooting down at them from the top of the elevated circle. The whole\r\ntheatre had been divided up by some diameters built in, which supported a\r\ncircular roof and intersected each other, the object being that the\r\nbeasts, divided into four herds, might be more easily speared at short\r\nrange from any point. In the midst of the struggle he grew weary, and\r\ntaking from a woman some sweet wine cooled in a club-shaped cup drank it\r\ndown at a gulp. At this both the populace and we on the instant all\r\nshouted this phrase, common at drinking bouts: \"Long life to you!\"\r\n\r\nLet no one think that I sully the dignity of history in noting down such\r\nhappenings. In general I should have preferred not to mention it, but\r\nsince it was one of the emperor's acts and I was myself present, taking\r\npart in everything seen and heard and spoken, I have judged it proper to\r\nsuppress none of the details, but to hand them down to the attention of\r\nthose who shall live hereafter, just as I should do in the case of\r\nanything else especially great and important. And, indeed, all the\r\nremaining events that took place in my lifetime I shall polish and\r\nelaborate more than earlier occurrences for the reason that my evidence is\r\nthat of a contemporary and I know no one else who has my ability at\r\nreducing notable things to writing that has studied them so exhaustively\r\nas I.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--19--] It was on the first day, then, that this took place. On\r\nthe others he frequently went down from the raised section to the bottom\r\nof the circle and slaughtered all the tame animals that he approached,\r\nsome of them also being led to him or brought before him in nets. He also\r\nkilled a tiger, a hippopotamus, and an elephant. After accomplishing this,\r\nhe retired, but at the conclusion of breakfast fought again as a\r\ngladiator. The form of fighting which he practiced and the armor which he\r\nused was that pertaining to the so-called _secutor:_ in his right\r\nhand he held the shield and in his left the wooden sword. He prided\r\nhimself very greatly upon being left-handed. His antagonist would be some\r\nprofessional athlete, or, perhaps, gladiator, with a cane; this was\r\nsometimes a man that the emperor himself challenged and sometimes one that\r\nthe people chose. In this and other matters he acted the same way as the\r\nother gladiators, except that they go in for a very small sum, whereas\r\nCommodus had twenty-five myriads from the gladiatorial fund given him each\r\nday. There stood beside him during the contest Aemilius Laetus, the\r\nprefect, and Eclectus, his cubicularius. He went through a skirmish, and,\r\nof course, conquered, and then, just as he was, he kissed them [Footnote:\r\nSupplying [Greek: ois] (after Reimar).] with his helmet on. After this the\r\nrest did some fighting.--The first day he personally paired all the\r\ncombatants, either down below, where he wore all the attire of Mercury,\r\nincluding a gilded wand, or else from his place on the elevated platform;\r\nand we took his proceeding as an omen. Later he ascended his customary\r\nseat and from that point viewed the remainder of the spectacle with us.\r\nNothing more was done that resembled child's play, but great numbers of\r\nmen were killed. At one place somebody delayed about slaying and he\r\nfastened the various opponents together and bade them all fight at once.\r\nAt that the men so bound struggled one against another and some killed\r\nthose who did not belong to their group, since the numbers and the limited\r\nspace had brought them into proximity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--20--] That spectacle as here described lasted fourteen days.\r\nWhile the contests were going on we senators invariably attended, along\r\nwith the knights, save that Claudius Pompeianus the elder never appeared,\r\nbut sent his sons, remaining away himself. He chose rather to be put to\r\ndeath for this than to behold the child of Marcus as emperor conducting\r\nhimself so.--Besides all the rest that we did, we shouted whatever we were\r\nbidden and this sentence continuously: \"Thou art lord, and thou art\r\nforemost, of all most fortunate: thou dost conquer, thou shalt conquer;\r\nfrom everlasting, Amazonian, thou dost conquer!\"\r\n\r\nOf the rest of the people many did not even enter the theatre and some\r\nmanaged to steal out quietly, for they were partly ashamed of what was\r\nbeing done and partly afraid. A story was current that he would like to\r\nshoot a few of them as Hercules had the Stymphalian birds. This story was\r\nbelieved, too, because once he had gathered all the men in the city who by\r\ndisease or some other calamity had lost their feet, had fastened some\r\ndragon's extremities about their knees, and after giving them sponges to\r\nthrow instead of stones had killed them with blows of a club, on the\r\npretence that they were giants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--21--] This fear was shared by all, both us and the rest. Here\r\nis another way in which he menaced us senators,--an act which he certainly\r\nexpected would be the death of us. He had killed an ostrich, and cutting\r\noff its head he came toward where we were sitting. In his left hand he\r\nheld the spoils and in the right stretched aloft his bloody sword. He\r\nspoke not a word, but with a grin wagged his head to and fro, intimating\r\nthat he would subject us to this same treatment. And many on the spot\r\nwould have perished by the sword for laughing at him (for it was laughter\r\nand not grief that overcame us), had I not myself chewed a laurel leaf,\r\nwhich I got from my garland, and brought the rest who were sitting near me\r\nto munch similar sprigs, so that in the constant motion of our jaws we\r\nmight conceal the fact that we were laughing. After this occurrence he\r\nraised our spirits, since before fighting again as a gladiator he bade us\r\nenter the theatre in the equestrian garb and with woolen cloaks. (This was\r\nsomething we never do when going into the theatre unless some emperor has\r\npassed away). And on the last day his helmet was carried out by the gates\r\nthrough which the dead are taken out. That made us all without exception\r\nthink that he was surely about to meet his end in some way.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--22--] And he did die (or rather was despatched) before a great\r\nwhile. Laetus and Eclectus, displeased at the way he acted, and moreover\r\nfilled with fear at the threats he uttered against them when he was\r\nchecked in any of his whims, formed a plot against him. Commodus was\r\nanxious to slay both the consuls (Erucius Clarus and Sosius Falco) and on\r\nthe first of the month to issue as consul and secutor at once from the\r\nplace where the gladiators are kept. He had the first cell in their\r\nquarters, as if he were one of them. Let no one be incredulous about this,\r\nfor he even cut off the head of the Colossus and put one of his own there\r\ninstead; and then, having given it a club and placed a bronze lion at its\r\nfeet so as to make it look like Hercules, he inscribed, besides the titles\r\nthat belonged to him, also this sentence: \"First of secutors to engage;\r\nthe only left-handed fighter that has conquered twelve times\"--I think it\r\nis--\"a thousand.\"\r\n\r\n[Lacuna] was written by Lucius Commodus Hercules, and upon it was\r\ninscribed the well known couplet, viz.: \"Hercules I, Jove's son, Lord of\r\nFair Fame, Not Lucius, howsoe'er constrained thereto.\"\r\n\r\nFor these reasons Laetus and Eclectus, making Marcia their confidante,\r\nattacked him. At night on the last of the year, when people were busy with\r\nmerry-making, they had Marcia administer poison to him in cooked beef. The\r\nwine he had consumed and his always immoderate use of the baths kept him\r\nfrom succumbing at once, and instead he vomited; this caused him to\r\nsuspect the attempt and he uttered some threats. Then they sent Narcissus,\r\nan athlete, to him and had this man strangle him in the midst of a bath.\r\nThis was the end that Commodus met after ruling twelve years, nine months,\r\nand fourteen days. He had lived thirty-one years and four months, and with\r\nhim the imperial house of the true Aurelii ceased.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--23--] After this there occurred most violent wars and\r\nfactional disturbances. The compilation of facts in this work of mine has\r\nbeen due to the following chance. I had written and published a book about\r\nthe dreams and signs which caused Severus to expect the imperial power;\r\nand he, happening to look at a copy that was sent him by me, wrote me a\r\nlong and complimentary acknowledgment. This letter I received about\r\nnightfall and soon after went to sleep. And in my slumbers Heaven\r\ncommanded me that a history be written. So it came about that I wrote the\r\nnarrative with which I am at this moment concerned. And because it pleased\r\nSeverus himself and other people very much, I then conceived a desire to\r\ncompile a record of all other matters of Roman interest. Therefore I\r\ndecided no longer to leave that treatise as a separate composition, but to\r\nincorporate it in this present history, in order that in one undertaking I\r\nmight write positively everything from the beginning as far as Fortune\r\nsees fit to permit. I have obtained this goddess, it appears, as the guide\r\nof the conduct of my life, and therefore I am dependent on her entirely:\r\nshe gives me strength for my historical research when I am respectful and\r\nsubdued before her, and wins me back to work by means of dreams when I am\r\ndiscouraged and give up the task: she grants me delightful hopes in regard\r\nto the future, that time will allow this history to survive and never let\r\nits brightness be dimmed. To gather an account of everything done by the\r\nRomans from the beginning until the death of Severus has taken me ten\r\nyears, and to arrange it in literary form twelve years more. The rest will\r\nbe written as opportunity offers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--24--] Prior to the death of Commodus there were the following\r\nsigns. Many ill-boding eagles wandered about the Capitol uttering cries\r\nthat portended naught of peace, and an owl hooted there. [Sidenote: A.D.\r\n191 (a.u. 944)] A fire, starting by night in some dwelling, laid hold of\r\nthe temple of Peace and spread to the stores of Egyptian and Arabian\r\nwares: then, leaping to a great height, it entered the palace and burned a\r\nvery large portion of it, so that the documents belonging to the empire\r\nalmost all perished. This as much as anything made it clear that the\r\ninjury would not stop in the City but extend over the entire civilized\r\nworld. The conflagration could not be extinguished by human hands,\r\nalthough great numbers of civilians and great numbers of soldiers were\r\ncarrying water and Commodus himself came from the suburbs to cheer them\r\non. Only after it had destroyed everything on which it had fastened did it\r\nspend its force and reach a limit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIO'S ROMAN HISTORY\r\n74\r\n\r\nPertinax, through the agency of Eclectus and Laetus, is created emperor by\r\nthe soldiers and by the senate (chapter 1).\r\n\r\nCommodus is declared an enemy and is made a subject for jest (chapter 2).\r\n\r\nKindness of Pertinax toward Pompeianus, Glabrio, and the senators (chapter\r\n3).\r\n\r\nOmens portending supreme power for him (chapter 4).\r\n\r\nPertinax reforms pernicious practices: he sells Commodus's apparatus of\r\nlicentiousness (chapter 5, 6).\r\n\r\nHis moderation with regard to his own family (chapter 7).\r\n\r\nAt the instigation of Laetus Falco the consul is slated for emperor\r\n(chapter 8).\r\n\r\nDeath of Pertinax Augustus (chapter 9, 10).\r\n\r\nFlavius Sulpicianus and Julianus strive in outbidding each other for the\r\nsovereignty (chapter 11).\r\n\r\nJulianus is made emperor contrary to the wishes of the senate and the\r\nRoman people (chapters 12, 13).\r\n\r\nAbout the three leaders, Severus, Niger, Albinus (chapter 14).\r\n\r\nSeverus forms an alliance with Albinus and proceeds against Julianus\r\n(chapter 15).\r\n\r\nJulianus, in the midst of laughable preparations, is killed by order of\r\nthe senate (chapters 16, 17).\r\n\r\n\r\nDURATION OF TIME, five months (from the Calends of January\r\nto the Calends of June), in which the following were consuls:\r\n\r\n1. Quintus Sosius Falco, C. Erucius Clarus.\r\n\r\n2. Flavius Sulpicianus, Fabius Cilo Septiminus (from the\r\nCalends of March).\r\n\r\n3. Silius Messala (from the Calends of May).\r\n(A.D. 193 = a.u. 946).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 193 (a.u. 946)] [Sidenote:--1--] Pertinax was one of those\r\nmen to whom no exception can be taken, but he ruled only for an\r\nexceedingly brief space of time and was then put out of the way by the\r\nsoldiers. While the fate of Commodus was still a secret the party of\r\nEclectus and Laetus came to him and acknowledged [Footnote: Reading\r\n[Greek: emaenusan] (Dindorf, after H. Stephanus).] what had been done. On\r\naccount of his excellence and reputation they were glad to select him. He,\r\nafter seeing them and hearing their story, sent his most trustworthy\r\ncomrade to view the body of Commodus. When the man confirmed the report of\r\nthe act, he was then conveyed secretly into the camp and caused the\r\nsoldiers consternation; but through the presence of the adherents of\r\nLaetus and by means of promises [Footnote: Reading [Greek: epaeggeilato]\r\n(Dindorf, after Bekker).] to give them three thousand denarii per man, he\r\nwon them over. They would certainly have remained content, had he not\r\nphrased the conclusion of his speech somewhat as follows: \"There are many\r\nunpleasant features, fellow-soldiers, in the present situation, but the\r\nrest with your help shall be set right again.\" On hearing this they took\r\noccasion to suspect that all the irregular privileges granted them by\r\nCommodus would be abolished. Though irritated, they nevertheless remained\r\nquiet, concealing their anger.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the fortifications he came to the senate-house while it was\r\nstill night, and after greeting us (so far as a man might approach him in\r\nthe midst of such a jostling throng) he said in an impromptu way: \"I have\r\nbeen named emperor by the soldiers; however, I don't desire the office and\r\nam going to resign it this very day because of my age and health and the\r\nunpleasant condition of affairs.\" This was no sooner said than we gave the\r\nselection our genuine approbation and chose him in very truth; for he was\r\nnoble in spirit and strong in body, except that he walked a little lame.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--2--] In this way was Pertinax declared emperor and Commodus an\r\nenemy, while both senate and people denounced the latter long and\r\nsavagely. They desired to hale away his body and tear it limb from limb,\r\nas they did his images; but, when Pertinax told them that the corpse had\r\nalready been interred, they spared his remains but glutted their rage on\r\nhis representations, calling him all sorts of names. But \"Commodus\" or\r\n\"emperor\" were two that no one applied to him. In stead, they termed him\r\n\"wretch\" and \"tyrant,\" adding in jest titles like \"the gladiator,\" \"the\r\ncharioteer,\" \"the left-handed,\" \"the ruptured man.\" To the senators, who\r\nhad been excited most by fear of Commodus, the crowd called out: \"Huzza,\r\nhuzza, you are saved, you have conquered!\" All the shouts that they had\r\nbeen accustomed to raise with a kind of rhythmic swing to pay court to\r\nCommodus in the theatres they now chanted metamorphosed into the most\r\nridiculous nonsense. Since they had got rid of one ruler, and as yet had\r\nnothing to fear from his successor, they made the most of their freedom in\r\nthe intervening time and secured a reputation for frankness by their\r\nfearlessness. They were not satisfied merely to be relieved of further\r\nterror, but desired to show their courage by wanton insolence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--3--] Pertinax was a Ligurian from Alba Pompeia; his father was\r\nnot of noble birth and he himself had just enough literary training for\r\nordinary needs. Under these conditions he had become an associate of\r\nClaudius Pompeianus, through whose influence he had become a commander in\r\nthe cavalry, and had reached such a height that he now came to be emperor\r\nover his former friend. And I at that time, during the reign of Pertinax,\r\nsaw Pompeianus for the first and last occasion. He was wont to live mostly\r\nin the country on account of Commodus [and very seldom came down to the\r\ncity], making his age and a disease of the eyes his excuse [and he had\r\nnever before, when I was present, entered the senate]. Moreover, after\r\nPertinax he was always ill. [During his reign he saw and was well\r\n[Footnote: Reading [Greek: erroto] (Dindorf).] and advised.] Pertinax\r\nhonored him mightily in every way and in the senate made him take the seat\r\nbeside him. [The same privilege he accorded also to Acilius Glabrio. This\r\nman, too, at that period both heard and saw. It was to these, then, that\r\nhe granted such surpassing honor.] Toward us also he behaved in a very\r\nsociable way. He was easy of access, listened readily to any one's\r\nrequest, and cordially answered as he thought right. Again, he gave us\r\nbanquets marked by moderation. Whenever he failed to invite us, he would\r\nsend to various persons various foods, even the least costly. For this the\r\nwealthy and vainglorious made great sport of him, but the rest of us, who\r\nvalued excellence above debauchery, approved his course.\r\n\r\n[Public opinion regarding Pertinax was so different from\r\nthat in the case of Commodus that those who heard what had happened,\r\nsuspecting that this story had been spread by Commodus to test them, in\r\nseveral instances (governors of provinces being particularly involved)\r\nimprisoned the men who brought the news. It was not that they did not wish\r\nit to be true, but they were more afraid of seeming to have helped destroy\r\nCommodus than of not attaching themselves to Pertinax. For under the\r\nlatter one who even committed an error of this kind might still breathe\r\nfreely, but under the former not even a faultless person could feel safe.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--4--] While he was still in Britain, after that great revolt\r\nwhich he quelled, and was being accorded praise on all sides, a horse\r\nnamed Pertinax won a race at Rome. It belonged to the Greens and was\r\npicked as a winner by Commodus. So, when its partisans raised a great\r\nshout, proclaiming \"It is Pertinax,\" the others, their opponents, in\r\ndisgust at Commodus likewise prayed (speaking with reference to the man,\r\nnot the horse): \"Would that it might be so!\" Later, when this same horse\r\nby reason of age had given up racing and was in the country, it was sent\r\nfor by Commodus, who brought it into the hippodrome, gilded its hoofs, and\r\nadorned its back with a gilded skin. And people suddenly seeing it cried\r\nout again: \"It is Pertinax!\" The very expression was itself ominous, since\r\nit occurred at the last horse-race that year, and immediately after it the\r\nsovereignty passed to Pertinax. A similar import was attached to the club,\r\nfor Commodus when about to fight on the final day had given it to\r\nPertinax.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--5--] It was in this way that Pertinax came into power. He\r\nobtained all the proper titles and a new one for wishing to be democratic.\r\nThat is, he was named Princeps Senatus, according to ancient custom. He at\r\nonce reduced to order everything that was previously irregular and lacking\r\nin discipline. He showed in his capacity of emperor kindliness and\r\nuprightness, unimpeachable management, and a most careful consideration\r\nfor the public welfare. Pertinax did everything, in fact, that a good\r\nemperor should do, and he removed the stigma of disgrace from the memories\r\nof those who had been unjustly put to death; moreover, he took oath that\r\nhe would never sanction such a penalty. Immediately some recalled their\r\nrelatives and some their friends with tears and joy at once; formerly not\r\neven these exhibitions of emotion were allowed. After this they exhumed\r\nthe bodies, some of which were found entire and some in fragments,\r\naccording as decay and time had caused each of them to fare, and they gave\r\nthem decent treatment and deposited them in their ancestral tombs.\r\n\r\nAt this time the treasury was suffering from such lack of funds that only\r\ntwenty-five myriad denarii could be found. Pertinax therefore had\r\ndifficulty in raising money from the images and the arms, the horses and\r\nthe trappings, and the favorites of Commodus, but gave to the Pretorians\r\nall that he had promised and to the people one hundred denarii apiece. All\r\nthe articles that Commodus had gathered by way of luxury and for armed\r\ncombats and for chariot driving were exposed in the auction-room, the\r\nprincipal object sought being their sale, though there was a further\r\nintention to show what were the late emperor's deeds and practices and to\r\nascertain who would purchase such articles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--6--] Laetus consistently spoke well of Pertinax and abused\r\nCommodus [relating all the latter's evil deeds].\r\n\r\nHe [Footnote: Pertinax is meant.] summoned some barbarians that had\r\nreceived a large sum of gold coin from Commodus in return for preservation\r\nof peace (the party was already on the road) and demanded its return,\r\nsaying: \"Tell your people that Pertinax is ruler.\" The foreigners knew his\r\nname very well as a result of the reverses they had suffered when he made\r\na campaign against them with Marcus.--Let me tell you another similar act\r\nof his intended to cast reflections upon Commodus. He found that some\r\nfilthy clowns and buffoons, disgusting in appearance, with still more\r\ndisgusting names and habits, had been made extremely wealthy by Commodus\r\non account of their wantonness and licentiousness; accordingly, he made\r\npublic their titles and the amounts they had acquired. The former caused\r\nlaughter and the latter wrath and grief, for there were some of them that\r\npossessed just the sums for which the emperor had slain numbers of\r\nsenators. However, Laetus did not remain permanently loyal to Pertinax, or\r\nperhaps we might even say not for a moment. Since he did not get what he\r\nwanted, he proceeded to incite the soldiers against him (as will be\r\nrelated).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--7--] Pertinax appointed as prefect of the city his\r\nfather-in-law, Flavius Sulpicianus, a man who in any case deserved the\r\nposition. Yet he was unwilling to make his wife Augusta or his son Caesar,\r\nthough we voted him permission. He rejected emphatically each proposition,\r\nwhether because he had not yet firmly rooted his own power, or because he\r\ndid not choose to let his unchaste consort sully the name of Augusta. As\r\nfor his son, who was still a child, he did not care to have him spoiled by\r\nthe dignity [Footnote: Reading [Greek: ogkho] (Reimar) for the MS. [Greek:\r\nhorkho].] and the hope implied in the name before he should be educated.\r\nIndeed, he would not even bring him up in the palace, but on the very\r\nfirst day of his sovereignty he put aside everything that had belonged to\r\nhim previously and divided it between his children--he had also a\r\ndaughter--and gave orders that they should live at their grandfather's\r\nhouse; there he visited them occasionally in the capacity of father and\r\nnot of emperor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--8--] Now, since the soldiers were no longer allowed to plunder\r\nnor the Caesarians to indulge their licentiousness, they hated him\r\nbitterly. The Caesarians attempted no revolt, because they were unarmed,\r\nbut the Pretorian soldiers and Laetus formed a plot against him. In the\r\nfirst place they selected Falco the consul for emperor, because he was\r\nprominent for both wealth and family, and purposed to bring him to the\r\ncamp while Pertinax was at the coast investigating the corn supply. The\r\nlatter, learning of the plan, returned in haste to the City, and coming\r\nbefore the senate said: \"You should not be ignorant, Conscript Fathers,\r\nthat though I found but twenty-five myriad denarii, I have distributed as\r\nmuch to the soldiers as did Marcus and Lucius, to whom were left\r\nsixty-seven thousand five hundred myriads. It is the surprising Caesarians\r\nwho have been responsible for this deficiency of funds.\" Pertinax told a\r\nlie when he said that he had bestowed upon the soldiers an equal amount\r\nwith Lucius and Marcus; for the one had given them about five thousand and\r\nthe other about three thousand denarii apiece. The soldiers and the\r\nCaesarians, who were present in the senate in great numbers, became\r\nmightily indignant and muttered dangerously. But as we were about to\r\ncondemn Falco [and were already declaring him an enemy] Pertinax rose and\r\ncried out: \"Heaven forbid that any senator, while I am ruler, be put to\r\ndeath even for a just cause!\" [And in this way Falco's life was saved, and\r\nthenceforth he lived in the country, preserving a cautious and respectful\r\ndemeanor.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--9--] But Laetus, using Falco as a starting point, destroyed\r\nmany of the soldiers on the pretence that the emperor ordered it. The\r\nrest, when they became aware of it, were afraid that they should perish,\r\ntoo, and raised a tumult. Two hundred bolder than their mates invaded the\r\npalace with drawn swords. Pertinax had no warning of their approach until\r\nthey had got upstairs. Then his wife rushed in and informed him what had\r\nhappened. On learning this he behaved in a way which one may call noble or\r\nsenseless or however one pleases. For, whereas he might probably have\r\nkilled his assailants (since he had the night-guard and the cavalry by to\r\nprotect him and there were also many other people in the palace at the\r\ntime), or might at any rate have concealed himself and made his escape to\r\nsome place or other, and might have closed the doors of the palace and the\r\nother intervening doors, he, nevertheless, adopted neither alternative.\r\nInstead, hoping to awe them by his presence and thus gain a hearing and\r\npersuade them to their duty, he confronted the approaching band, which was\r\nalready indoors. No one of their fellow soldiers had barred the way, and\r\nthe porters and other Caesarians so far from making any door fast had\r\nopened absolutely all the entrances. The soldiers, seeing him, at first\r\nwere [Sidenote:--10--] abashed, save one, and rested their eyes on the\r\nfloor and began thrusting their swords back into their scabbards. But the\r\none exception leaped forward, exclaiming: \"This sword the soldiers have\r\nsent you,\" and forthwith made a dash at him, striking him a blow. Then his\r\ncomrades did not restrain themselves and felled their emperor together\r\nwith Eclectus. The latter alone had not deserted him and defended him as\r\nfar as he was able, even to the extent of wounding several. Wherefore I,\r\nwho still earlier believed that he had shown himself a man of worth, now\r\nthoroughly admired him. The soldiers cut off the head of Pertinax and\r\nstuck it on a spear, glorying in the deed. Thus did Pertinax, who\r\nundertook to restore everything in a brief interval, meet his end. He did\r\nnot comprehend, though a well trained man of affairs, that it is\r\nimpossible with safety to reform everything at once, but that the\r\nconstitution of a government requires, if anything does, both time and\r\nwisdom. He had lived sixty-seven years lacking four months and three days.\r\nHe had reigned eighty-seven days.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--11--] When the fate of Pertinax was reported, some ran to\r\ntheir homes and some to those of the soldiers, and paid heed to their own\r\nsafety. It happened that Sulpicianus had been despatched by Pertinax to\r\nthe camp to set in order matters there, and he consequently stayed there\r\nand took action looking to the appointment of an emperor. But there was a\r\ncertain Didius Julianus [of senatorial rank but eccentric character], an\r\ninsatiate money-getter and reckless spender, always anxious for a change\r\nin the government, who on account of the last named proclivity had been\r\ndriven out by Commodus to his own city, Mediolanum. He, accordingly, on\r\nhearing of the death of Pertinax, hastily made his way to the camp, and\r\nstanding near the gates of the fort made offers to the soldiers in regard\r\nto the Roman throne. Then ensued a most disgraceful affair and one\r\nunworthy of Rome. For just as is done in some market and auction-room,\r\nboth the city and her whole empire were bid off. The sellers were the\r\npeople who had killed their emperor, and the would-be buyers were\r\nSulpicianus and Julianus, who vied to outbid each other, one from within,\r\nthe other from without. By their increases they speedily reached the sum\r\nof five thousand denarii per man. Some of the guard kept reporting and\r\nsaying to Julianus: \"Sulpicianus is willing to give so much; now what will\r\nyou add?\" And again to Sulpicianus: \"Julianus offers so much; how much\r\nmore do you make it?\" Sulpicianus would have won the day, since he was\r\ninside and was prefect of the city and was the first to say five thousand,\r\nhad not Julianus raised his bid, and no longer by small degrees but by\r\ntwelve hundred and fifty denarii at once, which he offered with a great\r\nshout, indicating the amount likewise on his fingers. Captivated by the\r\ndifference and at the same time through fear that Sulpicianus might avenge\r\nPertinax (an idea that Julianus put into their heads) they received the\r\nhighest bidder inside and designated him emperor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--12--] So toward evening the new ruler turned his steps with\r\nspeed toward the Forum and senate-house. He was escorted by a vast number\r\nof Pretorians with numerous standards as if prepared for action, his\r\nobject being to scare both us and the populace and thereby secure our\r\nallegiance. The soldiers called him \"Commodus,\" and exalted him in various\r\nother ways. As the news was brought to us each individually, and we\r\nascertained the truth, we were possessed with fear of Julianus and the\r\nsoldiers, especially all of us who had [Lacuna] any favors for Pertinax.\r\n[Footnote: A slight gap in the MS., where we should perhaps read: \"all of\r\nus who had done any favors for Pertinax or anything to displease Julianus\"\r\n(Boissevain).] [Lacuna] I was one of them, for I had been honored by\r\nPertinax in various ways, owing to him my appointment as praetor, and when\r\nacting as advocate for others at trials I had frequently proved Julianus\r\nin the wrong on many points. Nevertheless, we put in an appearance, and\r\npartly for this very reason, since it did not seem to us to be safe to\r\nhide at home, for fear that act in itself might arouse suspicion. So when\r\nbath [Footnote: Reading [Greek: leloumenoi] (Reiske) for the MS. [Greek:\r\ndedoulomenoi].] and dinner were both over, we pushed our way through the\r\nsoldiers, entered the senate-house, and heard the potentate deliver a\r\ncharacteristic speech, in the course of which he said: \"I see that you\r\nneed a ruler, and I myself am better fitted than any one else to direct\r\nyou. And I should mention all the advantages I can offer, if you did not\r\nknow them perfectly and had not already had experience with me.\r\nConsequently, I felt no need of being attended by many soldiers, but have\r\ncome to you alone, that you may ratify what has been given me by them.\" \"I\r\nam here alone\" is what he said, when he had surrounded the entire exterior\r\nof the senate-house with heavily armed men and had a number of soldiers in\r\nthe senate-house itself. Moreover, he mentioned our being aware what kind\r\nof person he was, and made us both hate and fear him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--13--] In this way he got his imperial power confirmed also by\r\ndecrees of the senate and returned to the palace. Finding the dinner that\r\nhad been prepared for Pertinax he made great fun of it, and sending out to\r\nevery place from which by any means whatever something expensive could be\r\nprocured at that time of day he satisfied his hunger (the corpse was still\r\nlying in the building) and then proceeded to amuse himself by dicing.\r\nAmong his companions was Pylades the dancer. The next day we went up to\r\nvisit him, feigning in looks and behavior much that we did not feel, so as\r\nnot to let our grief be detected. The populace, however, openly frowned\r\nupon the affair, spoke its mind as much at it pleased, and was ready to do\r\nwhat it could. Finally, when he came to the senate-house and was about to\r\nsacrifice to Janus before the entrance, all bawled out as if by\r\npreconcerted arrangement, terming him empire-plunderer and parricide. He\r\naffected not to be angry and promised them some money, whereupon they grew\r\nindignant at the implication that they could be bribed and all cried out\r\ntogether: \"We don't want it, we won't take it!\" The surrounding buildings\r\nechoed back the shout in a way to make one shudder. When Julianus had\r\nheard their response, he could endure it no longer, but ordered that those\r\nwho stood nearest should be slain. That excited the populace a great deal\r\nmore, and it did not cease expressing its longing for Pertinax or its\r\nabuse of Julianus, its invocations of the gods or its curses upon the\r\nsoldiers. Though many were wounded and killed in many parts of the city,\r\nthey continued to resist and finally seized weapons and made a rush into\r\nthe hippodrome. There they spent the night and the ensuing day without\r\nfood or drink, calling upon the remainder of the soldiery (especially\r\nPescennius Niger and his followers in Syria) with prayers for assistance.\r\nLater, feeling the effects of their outcries and fasting and loss of\r\nsleep, they separated and kept quiet, awaiting the hoped for deliverance\r\nfrom abroad.\r\n\r\n  \"I do not assist the populace: for it has not called upon me.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--14--] Julianus after seizing the power in this way managed\r\naffairs in a servile fashion, paying court to the senate as well as to men\r\nof any influence. Sometimes he made offers, again he bestowed gifts, and\r\nhe laughed and sported with anybody and everybody. He was constantly going\r\nto the theatre and kept getting up banquets: in fine, he left nothing\r\nundone to win our favor. However, he was not trusted; his servility was so\r\nabject that it made him an object of suspicion. Everything out of the\r\ncommon, even if it seems to be a kindness to somebody, is regarded by men\r\nof sense as a trap.\r\n\r\nThe senate had at one time voted him a golden statue and he refused to\r\naccept it, saying: \"Give me a bronze one so that it may last; for I\r\nperceive that the gold and silver statues of the emperors that ruled\r\nbefore me have been torn down, whereas the bronze ones remain.\" In this he\r\nwas not right: since 'tis excellence that safeguards the memory of\r\npotentates. And the bronze statue that was bestowed upon him was torn down\r\nafter he was overthrown.\r\n\r\nThis was what went on in Rome. Now I shall speak about what happened\r\noutside and the various revolutions. There were three men at this time who\r\nwere commanding each three legions of citizens and many foreigners\r\nbesides, and they all asserted their claims,--Severus, Niger, and Albinus.\r\nThe last-named governed Britain, Severus Pannonia, and Niger Syria. These\r\nwere the three persons darkly indicated by the three stars that suddenly\r\ncame to view surrounding the sun, when Julianus in our presence was\r\noffering the Sacrifices of Entrance in front of the senate-house. These\r\nheavenly bodies were so very brilliant that the soldiers kept continually\r\nlooking at them and pointing them out to one another, declaring moreover\r\nthat some dreadful fate would befall the usurper. As for us, however much\r\nwe hoped and prayed that it might so prove, yet the fear of the moment\r\nwould not permit us to gaze at them, save by occasional glances. Such are\r\nthe facts that I know about the matter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--15--] Of the three leaders that I have mentioned Severus [was]\r\nthe shrewdest [in being able to foresee the future with accuracy, to\r\nmanage present affairs successfully, to ascertain everything concealed as\r\nwell as if it had been laid bare and to work out every complicated\r\nsituation with the greatest ease.] He understood in advance that after\r\ndeposing Julianus the three would fall to blows with one another and offer\r\ncombat for the possession of the empire, and therefore determined to win\r\nover the rival who was nearest him. So he sent a letter by one of his\r\ntrusted managers to Albinus, creating him Caesar. Of Niger, who was proud\r\nof having been invoked by the people, he had no hopes. Albinus on the\r\nsupposition that he was going to share the empire with Severus remained\r\nwhere he was: Severus made all strategic points in Europe, save Byzantium,\r\nhis own and hastened toward Rome. He did not venture outside a protecting\r\ncircle of weapons, having selected his six hundred most valiant men in\r\nwhose midst he passed his time day and night; these did not once put off\r\ntheir breastplates until they reached Rome.\r\n\r\n[This Fulvius [Footnote: The name, so far as can be discerned in the MS.,\r\nmay be Fulvius or Flavius or Fabius. The position and import of the\r\nfragment are alike doubtful.] (?) too, who when governor of Africa had\r\nbeen tried and condemned by Pertinax for rascality, avarice, and\r\nlicentiousness, was later elevated to the highest position by the same\r\nman, now become emperor, as a favor to Severus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--16--] Julianus on learning the condition of affairs had the\r\nsenate make Severus an enemy and proceeded to prepare against him. [In the\r\nsuburbs he constructed a rampart, wherein he set gates, that he might take\r\nup a position there outside and fight from that base.] The City during\r\nthese days became nothing more nor less than a camp, pitched, as it were,\r\nin hostile territory. There was great turmoil from the various bodies of\r\nthose bivouacked and exercising,--men, horses, elephants. The mass of the\r\npopulation stood in great fear of the armed men [because the latter hated\r\nthem.] Occasionally laughter would overcome us. The Pretorians did nothing\r\nthat was expected of their name and reputation, for they had learned to\r\nlive delicately. The men summoned from the fleet that lay at anchor in\r\nMisenum did not even know how to exercise. The elephants found the towers\r\noppressive and so would not even carry their drivers any longer [but threw\r\nthem off also]. What caused us most amusement was his strengthening the\r\npalace with latticed gates and strong doors. For, as it seemed likely that\r\nthe soldiers would never have slain Pertinax so easily if the building had\r\nbeen securely fastened, Julianus harbored the belief that in case of\r\ndefeat he would be able to shut himself up there and survive.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he put to death both Laetus and Marcia, so that all the\r\nconspirators against Commodus had now perished. Later Severus gave\r\nNarcissus also to the beasts, making the proclamation (verbatim): \"This is\r\nthe man that strangled Commodus.\" The emperor likewise killed many boys\r\nfor purposes of enchantments, thinking that he could avert some future\r\ncalamities, if he should ascertain them in advance. And he kept sending\r\nman after man to find Severus and assassinate him. [Vespronius Candidus, a\r\nman of very distinguished rank but still more remarkable for his\r\nsullenness and boorishness, came near meeting his end at the hands of the\r\nsoldiers.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--17--] The avenger had now reached Italy and without striking a\r\nblow took possession of Ravenna. The men whom his opponent kept sending to\r\nhim to either persuade him to turn back or else block his approaches were\r\nwon over. The Pretorians, in whom Julianus reposed most confidence, were\r\nbecoming worn out by constant toil and were getting terribly alarmed at\r\nthe report of Severus's proximity. At this juncture Julianus called us\r\ntogether and bade us vote for Severus to be his colleague in office.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers were led to believe by communications from Severus that, if\r\nthey would surrender the assassins of Pertinax and themselves offer no\r\nhostile demonstration, they should receive no harm; therefore they\r\narrested the men who had killed Pertinax and announced this very fact to\r\nSilius Messala, the consul. The latter assembled us in the Athenaeum,\r\n[Footnote: Located on the Capitol, and established by Hadrian.] so called\r\nfrom the fact that it was a seat of educational activity, and informed us\r\nof the news from the soldiers. We then sentenced Julianus to death, named\r\nSeverus emperor, and bestowed heroic honors upon Pertinax. So it was that\r\nJulianus came to be slain as he was reclining in the palace itself; he had\r\nonly time to say: \"Why, what harm have I done? Whom have I killed?\" He had\r\nlived sixty years, four months, and the same number of days, out of which\r\nhe had reigned sixty-six days.\r\n\r\nDio, 74th Book: \"Men of intelligence should neither begin a war nor seek\r\nto evade it when it is thrust upon them. They should rather grant pardon\r\nto him who voluntarily conducts himself properly, in spite Of any previous\r\ntransgression, [Lacuna]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIO'S ROMAN HISTORY\r\n\r\nSeverus takes vengeance on the Pretorians who were the assassins of\r\nPertinax and enters the city (chapters 1, 2).\r\n\r\nProdigies which portended the sovereignty to Severus (chapter 3).\r\n\r\nFuneral procession which he superintended, in honor of Pertinax (chapters\r\n4, 5).\r\n\r\nWar of Severus Augustus against Pescennius Niger (chapters 6-9).\r\n\r\nThe storming of Byzantium (chapters 10-14).\r\n\r\n\r\nDURATION OF TIME.\r\n\r\nQ.

Before reaching Rome he summoned those remaining [Pretorians],\r\nsurrounded them in a plain while they still did not know what was going\r\nto happen to them, and having reproached them long and bitterly for\r\ntheir transgression against their emperor he relieved them of their\r\narms, took away their horses, and expelled them from Rome. The majority\r\nreluctantly proceeded to throw away their arms and let their horses go,\r\nand scattered uninjured, in their tunics. One man, as his horse refused\r\nto leave him, but kept following him and neighing, slew both the beast\r\nand himself. To the spectators it seemed that the horse also was glad to\r\ndie.\r\n\r\nWhen he had attended to this matter Severus entered Rome; he went as far\r\nas the gates on horseback and in cavalry costume, but from that point on\r\nchanged to citizen's garb and walked. The entire army, both, infantry and\r\ncavalry, in full armor accompanied him. The spectacle proved the most\r\nbrilliant of all that I have witnessed, for the whole city had been decked\r\nwith wreaths of blossoms and laurel and besides being adorned with richly\r\ncolored stuffs blazed with lights and burning incense. The population,\r\nclad in white and jubilant, gave utterance to many hopeful expressions.\r\nThe soldiers were present, conspicuous by their arms, as if participating\r\n[Footnote: Reading [Greek: pompeyontes] (Dindorf, after Bekker).] in some\r\nfestival procession, and we, too, were walking about in our best attire.\r\nThe crowd chafed in their eagerness to see him and to hear him say\r\nsomething, as if his voice had been somehow changed by his good fortune,\r\nand some of them held one another up aloft to get a look at him from a\r\nhigher position.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--2--] Having entered in this style he began to make us rash\r\npromises, such as the good emperors of old had given, to the effect that\r\nhe would not put any senator to death. He not only took oath concerning\r\nthis matter, but what was of greater import he also ordered it ratified by\r\npublic decree, and passed an ordinance that both the emperor and the\r\nperson who helped him in any such deed should be considered an\r\nenemy,--themselves and also their children. Yet he was himself the first\r\nto break the law and instead of keeping it caused the death of many\r\npersons. Even Julius Solon himself, who framed this decree according to\r\nimperial mandate, was a little later murdered. The emperor did many things\r\nthat were not to our liking. [He was blamed for making the city turbulent\r\nby the multitude of soldiers and he oppressed the commonwealth by\r\nexcessive expenditure of funds: he was blamed most of all for placing his\r\nhope of safety in the strength of his army and not in the good-will of his\r\ncompanions.] But some found fault with him especially because, whereas it\r\nhad been the custom for the body-guard to be drawn from Italy, Spain,\r\nMacedonia and Noricum only,--a plan which furnished men more distinguished\r\nin appearance and of simpler habits,--he had abolished this method, [He\r\nruled that any vacancies should be filled from all the legions alike; this\r\nhe did with the idea that he should find them as a result more conversant\r\nwith military practices and should be setting up warfare as a kind of\r\nprize for the excellent. As a matter of fact he incidentally ruined all\r\nthe most reliable men of military age in Italy, who turned their attention\r\nto robbery and gladiatorial fighting in place of the service that had\r\npreviously claimed it.] and filled the city with a throng of motley\r\nsoldiers, most savage in appearance, most terrifying in their talk, and\r\nmost uncultured to associate with.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--3--] The signs which led him to expect the sovereignty were\r\nthese. When he had been registered in the senate-house, it seemed to him\r\nin a vision that a she-wolf suckled him, as was the case with Romulus. On\r\nthe occasion of his marrying Julia, Faustina, the wife of Marcus, prepared\r\ntheir bedchamber in the temple of Venus opposite the palace; and once,\r\nwhen he was asleep, water gushed from his hand as from a spring; and when\r\nhe was governor of Lugdunum, the whole Roman domain approached and greeted\r\nhim,--all this in dreams, I mean. At another time he was taken by some one\r\nto a point affording a wide view; and as he gazed from it over all the\r\nearth and all the sea he laid his fingers on them as one might on some\r\ninstrument [Footnote: Compare Plato, Republic, 399 C.] capable of all\r\nharmonies, and they answered to his touch. Again, he thought that in the\r\nRoman Forum a horse threw Pertinax, who was already mounted, but readily\r\ntook him on its back. These things he had already learned from dreams, but\r\nin his waking hours he had, while a youth, ignorantly seated himself upon\r\nthe imperial chair. This accident, taken with the rest, indicated\r\nrulership to him in advance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--4--] Upon attaining that condition he erected a heroum to\r\nPertinax and commanded that his name should be repeated in the course of\r\nall prayers and of all oaths. A gold image of him was ordered brought into\r\nthe hippodrome on a car drawn by elephants and three gilded thrones for\r\nhim conveyed into the remaining theatres. His funeral, in spite of the\r\ntime elapsed since his death, took place as follows:\r\n\r\nIn the Forum Romanum a wooden platform was constructed hard by the stone\r\none, upon which was set a building without walls but encompassed by\r\ncolumns, with elaborate ivory and gold decoration. In it a couch of\r\nsimilar material was placed, surrounded by heads of land and sea\r\ncreatures, and adorned with purple coverlets interwoven with gold. Upon it\r\nhad been laid a kind of wax image of Pertinax, arrayed in triumphal\r\nattire. A well-formed boy was scaring the flies away from it with peacock\r\nfeathers, as though it were really a person sleeping. While it was lying\r\nthere in state, Severus, we senators, and our wives approached, clad in\r\nmourning garb. [Footnote: Reading [Greek: penthikos] (Sylburgius,\r\nBoissevain et al)..] The ladies sat in the porticos, and we under the open\r\nsky. After this there came forward, first, statues of all the famous\r\nancient Romans, then choruses of boys and men, intoning a kind of mournful\r\nhymn to Pertinax. Next were all the subject nations, represented by bronze\r\nimages, attired in native garb. And the guilds in the City itself,--those\r\nof the lictors and the scribes and the heralds, and all others of the\r\nsort,--followed on. Then came images of other men who were famous for some\r\ndeed or invention or brilliant trait. Behind them were the cavalry and\r\ninfantry in armor, the race-horses, and all the funeral offerings that the\r\nemperor and we and our wives, together with distinguished knights and\r\npeoples and the collegia of the city, had sent. They were accompanied by\r\nan altar, entirely gilded, the beauty of which was enhanced by ivory and\r\nIndic jewels. [Sidenote:--5--] When these had gone by, Severus mounted the\r\nPlatform of the Beaks and read a eulogy of Pertinax. We shouted our\r\napproval many times in the midst of his discourse, partly praising and\r\npartly bewailing Pertinax, but our cries were loudest when he had ceased.\r\nFinally, as the couch was about to be moved, we all together uttered our\r\nlamentations and all shed tears. Those who carried the bier from the\r\nplatform were the high priests and the officials who were completing their\r\nterm of office, as well as any that had been appointed for the ensuing\r\nyear. These gave it to certain knights to carry. The rank and file of us\r\nwent ahead of the bier, some beating our breasts and others playing on the\r\nflute some dirge-like air; the emperor followed behind all, and in this\r\norder we arrived at the Campus Martius. Here there had been built a pyre,\r\ntower-shaped and triple pointed, adorned with ivory and gold together with\r\ncertain statues. On its very summit was lodged a gilded chariot that\r\nPertinax had been wont to drive. Into this the funeral offerings were cast\r\nand the bier was placed in it, and next Severus and the relatives of\r\nPertinax kissed the image. Our monarch ascended a tribunal, while we the\r\nsenate, except officials, took our places on the benches, that with safety\r\nand convenience alike we might view what went on. The magistrates and the\r\nequestrian order, arrayed in a manner becoming their station, besides the\r\ncavalry of the army and the infantry, passed in and out performing\r\nintricate evolutions, both traditional and newly invented. Then at length\r\nthe consuls applied fire to the mound, which being done an eagle flew up\r\nfrom it. In this way was immortality secured for Pertinax [who (although\r\nbodies of men engaged in warfare usually turn out savage and those given\r\nto peace cowardly) excelled equally in both departments, being an enemy to\r\ndread, yet shrewd in the arts of peace. His boldness, wherein bravery\r\nappears, he displayed towards foreigners and rebels, but his clemency,\r\nwherewith is mingled justice, towards friends and the orderly elements of\r\nsociety. When advanced to preside over the destinies of the world, he was\r\nnever ensnared by the increase of greatness so as to show himself in some\r\nthings more subservient and in others more haughty than was fitting. He\r\nunderwent no change from the beginning to the very end, but was august\r\nwithout sullenness, gentle without humiliating lowliness, prudent, yet did\r\nno injury, just without inquisitorial qualities, a close administrator\r\nwithout stinginess, highminded, but devoid of boasts.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--6--] Now Severus made a campaign against Niger. The latter was\r\nan Italian, one of the knights, remarkable for nothing either very good or\r\nvery bad, so that one could either greatly praise or greatly censure him.\r\n[Wherefore he had been assigned to Syria by Commodus.] He had as a\r\nlieutenant, together with others, Aemilianus, who [by remaining neutral\r\nand watching the course of events] was thought to surpass all the senators\r\nof that day in understanding and in experience of affairs; for he had been\r\ntested in many provinces. [These conditions and the fact that he was a\r\nrelative of Albinus had made him conceited.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--7--] [Niger was not in general a well-balanced man and though\r\nhe had very great abilities still fell into error. But at this time he was\r\nmore than usually elated, so that he showed how much he liked those who\r\ncalled him \"the new Alexander\"; and when one man asked, \"Who gave you\r\npermission to do this?\" he pointed to his sword and rejoined, \"This did.\"\r\nWhen the war broke out Niger had gone to Byzantium and from that point\r\nconducted a campaign against Perinthus. He was disturbed, however, by\r\nunfavorable omens that came to his notice. An eagle perched upon a\r\nmilitary shrine and remained there till captured, in spite of attempts\r\nto scare it away. Bees made wax around the military standards and about\r\nhis images most of all. For these reasons he retired to Byzantium.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 194 (a.u. 947)] Now Aemilianus while engaged in conflict\r\nwith some of the generals of Severus near Cyzicus was defeated by them and\r\nslain. After this, between the narrows of Nicaea and Cius, they had a\r\ngreat war of various forms. Some battled in close formation on the plains;\r\nothers occupied the hill-crests and hurled stones and javelins at their\r\nopponents from the higher ground; still others got into boats and\r\ndischarged their bows at the enemy from the lake. At first the adherents\r\nof Severus, under the direction of Candidus, were victorious; for they\r\nfound their advantage in the higher ground from which they fought. But the\r\nmoment Niger himself appeared a pursuit in turn was instituted by Niger's\r\nmen and victory was on their side. Then Candidus caught hold of the\r\nstandard bearers and turned them to face the enemy, upbraiding the\r\nsoldiers for their flight; at this his followers were ashamed, turned\r\nback, and once more conquered those opposed to them. Indeed, they would\r\nhave destroyed them utterly, had not the city been near and the night a\r\ndark one.\r\n\r\nThe next event was a tremendous battle at Issus, near the\r\nso-called Gates. In this contest Valerianus and Anullinus [Footnote: _P.\r\nCornelius Anullinus._] commanded the army of Severus, whereas Niger was\r\nwith his own ranks and marshaled them for war. This pass, the Cilician\r\n\"Gates\", [Footnote: Compare Xenophon's _Anabasis_, I, 4, 4-5.] is so\r\nnamed on account of its narrowness. On the one side rise precipitous\r\nmountains, and on the other sheer cliffs descend to the sea. So Niger had\r\nhere made a camp on a strong hill, and he put in front heavy-armed\r\nsoldiers, next the javelin slingers and stone throwers, and behind all the\r\narchers. His purpose was that the foremost might thrust back such as\r\nassailed them in hand-to-hand conflict, while the others from a distance\r\nmight be able to bring their force into play over the heads of the others.\r\nThe detachment on the left and that on the right were defended by the\r\nsea-crags and by the forest, which had no issue. This is the way in which\r\nhe arranged his army, and he stationed the beasts of burden close to it,\r\nin order that none of them should be able to flee in case they should wish\r\nit. Anullinus after making all this out placed in advance the heavier part\r\nof his force and behind it his entire light-armed contingent, to the end\r\nthat the latter, though discharging their weapons from a distance might\r\nstill retard the progress of the enemy, while the solidity of the advance\r\nguard rendered the upward passage safe for them. The cavalry he sent with\r\nValerianus, bidding him, so far as he could, go around the forest and\r\nunexpectedly fall upon the troops of Niger from the rear. When they came\r\nto close quarters, the soldiers of Sevents placed some of their shields in\r\nfront of them and held some above their heads, making a testudo, and in\r\nthis formation they approached the enemy. So the battle was a drawn one\r\nfor a long while, but eventually Niger's men got decidedly the advantage\r\nboth by their numbers and by the topography of the country. They would\r\nhave been entirely victorious, had not clouds gathered out of a clear sky\r\nand a wind arisen from a perfect calm, while there were crashes of thunder\r\nand sharp flashes of lightning and a violent rain beat in their faces.\r\nThis did not trouble Severus's troops because it was behind them, but\r\nthrew Niger's men into great confusion since it came right against them.\r\nMost important of all, the opportune character of this occurrence infused\r\ncourage in the one side, which believed it was aided by Heaven, and fear\r\nin the other, which felt that the supernatural was warring against them;\r\nthus it made the former strong even beyond its own strength and terrified\r\nthe latter in spite of real power. Just as they were fleeing Valerianus\r\ncame in sight. Seeing him, they turned about, and after that, as Anullinus\r\nbeat them back, retreated once more. Then they wandered about, running\r\nthis way and that way, to see where they could break through.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--8--] It turned out that this was the greatest slaughter to\r\ntake place during the war in question. Two myriads of Niger's followers\r\nperished utterly. The fact was indicated also by the priest's vision.\r\nWhile Severus was in Pannonia, the priest of Jupiter saw in a vision a\r\nblack man force his way into the emperor's camps and meet his death by\r\nsuperior numbers. And by turning the name of Niger into Greek people\r\nrecognized that he was the one meant by the \"black\" person mentioned.\r\nDirectly Antioch had been captured (not long after) Niger fled from it,\r\nmaking the Euphrates his objective point, for he intended to seek refuge\r\namong the barbarians. His pursuers, however, overtook him; he was taken\r\nand had his head struck off. This head Severus sent to Byzantium and\r\ncaused to be reared on a cross, that the sight of it might incline the\r\nByzantines to his cause. The next move of Severus was to mete out justice\r\nto those who had belonged to Niger's party. [Of the cities and individuals\r\nhe chastised some and rewarded others. He executed no Roman senator, but\r\ndeprived most of them of their property and confined them on islands. He\r\nwas merciless in his search for money. Among other measures he exacted\r\nfour times the amount that any individuals or peoples had given to Niger,\r\nwhether they had done so voluntarily or under compulsion. He himself\r\ndoubtless perceived the injustice of it,] [Footnote: The MS. text is\r\nfaulty, and the translation, ventured independently, corresponds\r\napproximately to a suggestion by van Herwerden in Boissevain's edition.]\r\nbut as he required great sums, he paid no attention to the common talk.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--9--] Cassius Clemens, a senator, while on trial before Severus\r\nhimself, did not hide the truth but spoke with such frankness as the\r\nfollowing report will show:\r\n\r\n\"I,\" he said, \"was acquainted with neither you nor Niger, but as I found\r\nmyself in his part of the world, I accepted the situation heartily, not\r\nwith the idea of being hostile to you but with the purpose of deposing\r\nJulianus. I have, then, committed no wrong in this, since I labored\r\noriginally for the same ends as you, nor should I be censured for failing\r\nto desert the master whom I had once secured by the will of Heaven and for\r\nnot transferring my allegiance to you. You would not yourself have liked\r\nto have your intimate circle and fellow judges here betray your cause and\r\ngo over to him. Examine therefore not our bodies nor our names but the\r\nevents themselves. For in every point in which you condemn us you will be\r\npassing sentence upon yourself and your associates. However secure you may\r\nbe from conviction in any suit or by any court finding, still, in the\r\nreport of men, of which an eternal memory shall survive, you will be\r\nrepresented as making against yourself the same charges as have led to\r\npunishment [Footnote: Supplying, with Reiske, [Greek: soi [Lacuna]\r\nkolasthaenai].] in the case of others.\"--Severus admired this man for his\r\nfrankness and allowed him to keep half his property.\r\n\r\n[Many who had never even seen Niger and had not cooperated with him were\r\nvictims of abuse on the charge that they had been members of his party.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 195 (a.u. 948)] [Sidenote:--10--] The Byzantines performed\r\nmany remarkable deeds both during the life and after the death of Niger.\r\nThis city is favorably located with reference both to the continents and\r\nto the sea that lies between them, and is strongly intrenched by the\r\nnature of its position as well as by that of the Bosporus. The town sits\r\non high ground extending into the sea. The latter, rushing down from the\r\nPontus with the speed of a mountain torrent assails the headland and in\r\npart is diverted to the right, forming there the bay and harbors. But the\r\ngreater part of the water passes on with great energy past the city itself\r\ntoward the Propontis. Moreover, the place had walls that were very strong.\r\nTheir face was constructed of thick squared stones, fastened together by\r\nbronze plates, and the inner side of it had been strengthened with mounds\r\nand buildings so that the whole seemed to be one thick wall and the top of\r\nit formed a circuit betraying no flaws and easy to guard. Many large\r\ntowers occupied an exposed position outside it, with windows set close\r\ntogether on every side so that those assaulting the fortification in a\r\ncircle would be cut off between them. Being built at a short distance from\r\nthe wall and not in a regular line, but one here and another there over a\r\nrather crooked route, they were sure to command both sides of any\r\nattacking party. Of the entire circuit the part on the land side reached a\r\ngreat height so as to repel any who came that way: the portion next to the\r\nsea was lower. There, the rocks on which it had been reared and the\r\ndangerous character of the Bosporus were effective allies. The harbors\r\nwithin the wall had both been closed with chains and their breakwaters\r\ncarried towers projecting far out on each side, making approach impossible\r\nfor the enemy. And, in fine, the Bosporus was of the greatest aid to the\r\ncitizens. It was quite inevitable that once any person became entangled in\r\nits current he should willy-nilly be cast up on the land. This was a\r\nfeature quite satisfactory to friends, but impossible for foes to deal\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--11--] It was thus that Byzantium had been fortified. The\r\nengines, besides, the whole length of the wall, were of the most varied\r\ndescription. In one place they threw rocks and wooden beams upon parties\r\napproaching and in another they discharged stones and missiles and spears\r\nagainst such as stood at a distance. Hence over a considerable extent of\r\nterritory no one could draw near them without danger. Still others had\r\nhooks, which they would let down suddenly and shortly after draw up boats\r\nand machines. Priscus, a fellow-citizen of mine, had designed most of\r\nthem, and this fact both caused him to incur the death penalty and saved\r\nhis life. For Severus, on learning his proficiency, prevented his being\r\nexecuted. Subsequently he employed him on various missions, among others\r\nat the siege of Hatra, and his contrivances were the only ones not burned\r\nby the barbarians. He also furnished the Byzantines with five hundred\r\nboats, mostly of one bank, but some of two banks, and equipped with beaks.\r\nA few of them were provided with rudders at both ends, stern and prow, and\r\nhad a double quota of pilots and sailors in order that they might both\r\nattack and retire without turning around and damage their opponents while\r\nsailing back as well as while sailing forward.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--12--] Many, therefore, were the exploits and sufferings of the\r\nByzantines, since for the entire space of three years they were besieged\r\nby the armaments of practically the whole world. A few of their\r\nexperiences will be mentioned that seem almost marvelous. They captured,\r\nby making an opportune attack, some boats that sailed by and captured also\r\nsome of the triremes that were in their opponents' roadstead. This they\r\ndid by having divers cut their anchors under water, after which they drove\r\nnails into the ship's bottom and with cords attached thereto and running\r\nfrom friendly territory they would draw the vessel towards them. Hence one\r\nmight see the ships approaching shore by themselves, with no oarsman nor\r\nwind to urge them forward. There were cases in which merchants purposely\r\nallowed themselves to be captured by the Byzantines, though pretending\r\nunwillingness, and after selling their wares for a huge price made their\r\nescape by sea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 196 (a.u. 949)] When all the supplies in the town had been\r\nexhausted and the people had been set fairly in a strait with regard to\r\nboth their situation and the expectations that might be founded upon it,\r\nat first, although beset by great difficulties (because they were cut off\r\nfrom all outside resources), they nevertheless continued to resist; and to\r\nmake ships they used lumber taken from the houses and braided ropes of the\r\nhair of their women. Whenever any troops assaulted the wall, they would\r\nhurl upon them stones from the theatres, bronze horses, and whole statues\r\nof bronze. When even their normal food supply began to fail them, they\r\nproceeded to soak and eat hides. Then these, too, were used up, and the\r\nmajority, having waited for rough water and a squall so that no one might\r\nman a ship to oppose them, sailed out with the determination either to\r\nperish or to secure provender. They assailed the countryside without\r\nwarning and plundered every quarter indiscriminately. Those left behind\r\ncommitted a monstrous deed; for when they grew very faint, they turned\r\nagainst and devoured one another.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--13--] This was the condition of the men in the city. The rest,\r\nwhen they had laden their boats with more than the latter could bear, set\r\nsail after waiting this time also for a great storm. They did not succeed,\r\nhowever, in making any use of it. The Romans, noticing [Sidenote: A.D. 196\r\na.u. 949] that their vessels were overheavy and depressed almost to the\r\nwater's edge, put out against them. They assailed the company, which was\r\nscattered about as wind and flood chose to dispose them, and really\r\nengaged in nothing like a naval contest but crushed the enemy's boats\r\nmercilessly, striking many with their boat-hooks, ripping up many with\r\ntheir beaks, and actually capsizing some by their mere onset. The victims\r\nwere unable to do anything, however much they might have wished it: and\r\nwhen they attempted to flee in any direction either they would be sunk by\r\nforce of the wind, which encountered them with the utmost violence, or\r\nelse they would be overtaken by the enemy and destroyed. The inhabitants\r\nof Byzantium, as they watched this, for a time called unceasingly upon the\r\ngods and kept uttering now one shout and now another at the various\r\nevents, according as each one was affected by the spectacle or the\r\ndisaster enacted before his eyes. But when they saw their friends\r\nperishing all together, the united throng sent up a chorus of groans and\r\nwailings, and thereafter they mourned for the rest of the day and the\r\nwhole night. The entire number of wrecks proved so great that some drifted\r\nupon the islands and the Asiatic coast, and the defeat became known by\r\nthese relics before it was reported. The next day the Byzantines had the\r\nhorror increased even above what it had been. For, when the surf had\r\nsubsided, the whole sea in the vicinity of Byzantium was covered with\r\ncorpses and wrecks with blood, and many of the remains were cast up on\r\nshore, with the result that the catastrophe, now seen in its details,\r\nappeared even worse than when in process of consummation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--14--] The Byzantines straightway, though against their will,\r\nsurrendered their city. The Romans executed all the soldiers and\r\nmagistrates except the pugilist who had greatly aided the Byzantines and\r\ninjured the Romans. He perished also, for in order to make the soldiers\r\nangry enough to destroy him he immediately hit one with his fist and with\r\na leap gave another a violent kick.\r\n\r\nSeverus was so pleased at the capture of Byzantium that to his soldiers in\r\nMesopotamia (where he was at this time) he said unreservedly: \"We have\r\ntaken Byzantium, too!\" He deprived the city of its independence and of its\r\ncivil rank, and made it tributary, confiscating the property of the\r\ncitizens. He granted the town and its territory to the Perinthians, and\r\nthe latter, treating it after the manner of a village, committed\r\ninnumerable outrages. So far he seemed in a way to be justified in what he\r\ndid. His demolition of the walls of the city grieved the inhabitants no\r\nmore than did the loss of that reputation which the appearance of the\r\nwalls had caused them to enjoy; and incidentally he had abolished a strong\r\nRoman outpost and base of operations against the barbarians from the\r\nPontus and Asia. I was one that viewed the walls after they had fallen,\r\nand a person would have judged that they had been taken by some other\r\npeople than the Romans. I had also seen them standing and had heard them\r\n\"speak.\" There were seven towers extending from the Thracian gates to the\r\nsea. If a man approached any of these but the first, it was silent; but if\r\nhe shouted a few words at that one or threw a stone at it, it not only\r\nechoed and spoke itself but caused the second to do the same thing. In\r\nthis way the sound passed through them all alike, and they did not\r\ninterrupt one another, but all in their proper turn, one receiving the\r\nimpulse from the one before it, took up the echo and the voice and sent it\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIO'S ROMAN HISTORY\r\n76\r\n\r\nSeverus's war against the Osrhoeni, Adiabeni, and Arabians (chapters 1-3).\r\n\r\nSeverus's war against Albinus Caesar (chapters 4, 5).\r\n\r\nHow Albinus was vanquished by Severus and perished (chapters 6, 7).\r\n\r\nThe arrogance of Severus after his victory (chapters 7, 8).\r\n\r\nSeverus's Parthian expedition (chapter 9).\r\n\r\nHow he besieged the Atreni, but found his endeavors fruitless (chapters\r\n10-12).\r\n\r\nHow he started for Egypt: and about the source of the Nile (chapter 13).\r\n\r\nAbout the power and tyrannous conduct of Plautianus (chapters 14-16).\r\n\r\n\r\nDURATION OF TIME.\r\n\r\nScapula Tertullus, Tineius Clemens, (A.D. 195 = a.u. 948 = Third of\r\nSeverus, from the Calends of June).\r\n\r\nC.

During the progress of this siege Severus out of a\r\ndesire for fame had made a campaign against the barbarians,--the Osrhoeni,\r\nthe Adiabeni, and the Arabians. [The Osrhoeni and Adiabeni having revolted\r\nwere besieging Nisibis: defeated by Severus they sent an embassy to him\r\nafter the death of Niger, not to beg his clemency as wrongdoers but to\r\ndemand reciprocal favors, pretending to have brought about the outcome for\r\nhis benefit. It was for his sake, they said, that they had destroyed the\r\nsoldiers who belonged to Niger's party. Indeed, they sent a few gifts to\r\nhim and promised to restore the captives and whatever spoils were left.\r\nHowever, they were not willing either to abandon the walled towns they had\r\ncaptured or to accept the imposition of tributes, but they desired those\r\nin existence to be lifted from the country. It was this that led to the\r\nwar just mentioned.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--2--] When he had crossed the Euphrates and invaded hostile\r\nterritory, where the country was destitute of water and at this summer\r\nseason had become especially parched, he came dangerously near losing\r\ngreat numbers of soldiers. Wearied as they were by their tramping and the\r\nhot sun, clouds of dust that they encountered harrassed them greatly, so\r\nthat they could no longer walk nor yet speak, but only utter the word\r\n\"Water, water!\" When [moisture] appeared, on account of [its] strangeness\r\nit attracted no more attention than if it had not been found, till Severus\r\ncalled for a cup, and having filled it with water drank it down in full\r\nview of all. Upon this some others likewise drank and were invigorated.\r\nSoon after Severus entered Nisibis and himself waited there, but\r\ndespatched Lateranus and Candidus and Laetus severally among the\r\naforementioned barbarians. These upon attaining their goals proceeded to\r\nlay waste the land of the barbarians and to capture their cities. While\r\nSeverus was greatly priding himself upon this achievement and feeling that\r\nhe surpassed all mankind in both understanding and bravery, a most\r\nunexpected event took place. One Claudius, a robber, who overran Judaea\r\nand Syria and was sought for in consequence with great hue and cry, came\r\nto him one day with horsemen, like some military tribune, and saluted and\r\nkissed him. The visitor was not discovered at the time nor was he later\r\narrested. [And the Arabians, because none of their neighbors was willing\r\nto aid them, sent an embassy a second time to Severus making quite\r\nreasonable propositions. Still, they did not obtain what they wanted,\r\ninasmuch as they had not come in person.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 196 (a.u. 949)] [Sidenote:--3--] The Scythians, too, were\r\nin fighting humor, when at this juncture during a deliberation of theirs\r\nthunder and lightning-flashes with rain suddenly broke over them, and\r\nthunderbolts began to fall, killing their three foremost men. This caused\r\nthem to hesitate.\r\n\r\nSeverus again made three divisions of his army, and giving one to Laetus,\r\none to Anullinus, and one to Probus, sent them out against ARCHE [Lacuna];\r\n[Footnote: The MS. is corrupt. Adiabene, Atrene and Arbelitis have all\r\nbeen suggested as the district to which Dio actually referred here.] and\r\nthey, invading it in three divisions, subdued it not without trouble.\r\nSeverus bestowed some dignity upon Nisibis and entrusted the city to the\r\ncare of a knight. He declared he had won a mighty territory and had\r\nrendered it a bulwark of Syria. It is shown, on the contrary, by the facts\r\nthemselves that the place is responsible for our constant wars as well as\r\nfor great expenditures. It yields very little and uses up vast sums. And\r\nhaving extended our borders to include men who are neighbors of the Medes\r\nand Parthians rather than of ourselves, we are always, one might say,\r\nfighting over those peoples.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--4--] Before Severus had had time to recover breath from his\r\nconflicts with the barbarians he found a civil war on his hands with\r\nAlbinus, his Caesar. Severus after getting Niger out of the way was still\r\nnot giving him the rank of Caesar and had ordered other details in that\r\nquarter as he pleased; and Albinus aspired to the preeminence of emperor.\r\n[Footnote: Omitting [Greek: autou] (as Dindorf).] While the whole world\r\nwas moved by this state of affairs we senators kept quiet, at least so\r\nmany of us as inclining openly neither to one man nor the other yet shared\r\ntheir dangers and hopes. But the populace could not restrain itself and\r\nshowed its grief in the most violent fashion. It was at the last\r\nhorse-race before the Saturnalia, and a countless throng of people flocked\r\nto it. I too was present at the spectacle because the consul was a friend\r\nof mine and I heard distinctly everything that was said,--a fact which\r\nrenders me able to write a little about it.\r\n\r\nIt came about in this way. There had gathered (as I said) more people than\r\ncould be computed and they had watched the chariots contesting in six\r\ndivisions (which had been the way also in Oleander's time), applauding no\r\none in any manner, as was the custom. When these races had ceased and the\r\ncharioteers were about to begin another event, then they suddenly enjoined\r\nsilence upon one another and all clapped their hands simultaneously,\r\nshouting, besides, and entreating good fortune for the public welfare.\r\nThey first said this, and afterward, applying the terms \"Queen\" and\r\n\"Immortal\" to Rome, they roared: \"How long are we to suffer such\r\nexperiences?\" and \"Until when must we be at war?\" And after making a few\r\nother remarks of this kind they finally cried out: \"That's all there is to\r\nit!\" and turned their attention to the equestrian contest. In all of this\r\nthey were surely inspired by some divine afflation. For not otherwise\r\ncould so many myriads of men have started to utter the same shouts at the\r\nsame time like some carefully trained chorus or have spoken the words\r\nwithout mistake just as if they had practiced them.\r\n\r\nThis manifestation caused us still greater disturbance as did also the\r\nfact that so great a fire was of a sudden seen by night in the air toward\r\nthe north that some thought that the whole city and others that the sky\r\nitself was burning. But the most remarkable fact I have to chronicle is\r\nthat in clear weather a fine silvery rain descended upon the forum of\r\nAugustus, I did not see it in the air, but noticed it after it had fallen,\r\nand with it I silverplated some small bronze coins. These retained the\r\nsame appearance for three days: on the fourth all the substance rubbed\r\nupon them had disappeared.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--5--] A certain Numerianus, who taught children their letters,\r\nstarted from Rome for Galatia with I know not what object, and by\r\npretending to be a Roman senator sent by Severus to gather an army he\r\ncollected at first just a small force by means of which he destroyed a few\r\nof Albinus's cavalry, whereupon he unblushingly made some further promises\r\nin behalf of Severus. Severus heard of this and thinking that he was\r\nreally one of the senators sent him a message of praise and bade him\r\nacquire still greater power. The man did acquire greater power and gave\r\nmany remarkable exhibitions of ability besides obtaining seventeen hundred\r\nand fifty myriads of denarii, which he forwarded to Severus. After the\r\nlatter's victory Numerianus came to him, making no concealment, and did\r\nnot ask to become in very truth a senator. Indeed, though he might have\r\nbeen exalted by great honors and wealth, he did not choose to accept them,\r\nbut passed the remainder of his life in some country place, receiving from\r\nthe emperor some small allowance for his daily subsistence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 197 (a.u. 950)] [Sidenote:--6--] The struggle between\r\nSeverus and Albinus near Lugdunum is now to be described. At the outset\r\nthere were a hundred and fifty thousand soldiers on each side. Both\r\nleaders took part in the war, since it was a race for life and death,\r\nthough Severus had previously not been present at any important battle.\r\nAlbinus excelled in rank and in education, but his adversary was superior\r\nin warfare and was a skillful commander. It happened that in a former\r\nbattle Albinus had conquered Lupus, one of the generals of Severus, and\r\nhad destroyed many of the soldiers attending him. The present conflict\r\ntook many shapes and turns. The left wing of Albinus was beaten and sought\r\nrefuge behind the rampart, whereupon Severus 's soldiers in their pursuit\r\nburst into the enclosure with them, slaughtered their opponents and\r\nplundered their tents. Meantime the soldiers of Albinus arrayed on the\r\nright wing, who had trenches hidden in front of them and pits in the earth\r\ncovered over only on the surface, approached as far as these snares and\r\nhurled javelins from a distance. They did not go very far but turned back\r\nas if frightened, with the purpose of drawing their foes into pursuit.\r\nThis actually took place. Severus's men, nettled by their brief charge and\r\ndespising them for their retreat after so short an advance, rushed upon\r\nthem without a thought that the whole intervening space could not be\r\neasily traversed. When they reached the trenches they were involved in a\r\nfearful catastrophe. The men in the front ranks as soon as the surface\r\ncovering broke through fell into the excavations and those immediately\r\nbehind stumbled over them, slipped, and likewise fell. The rest crowded\r\nback in terror, their retreat being so sudden that they themselves lost\r\ntheir footing, upset those in the rear, and pushed them into a deep\r\nravine. Of course there was a terrible slaughter of these soldiers as well\r\nas of those who had fallen into the trenches, horses and men perishing in\r\none wild mass. In the midst of this tumult the warriors between the ravine\r\nand the trenches were annihilated by showers of stones and arrows.\r\n\r\nSeverus seeing this came to their assistance with the Pretorians, but this\r\nstep proved of so little benefit that he came near causing the ruin of the\r\nPretorians and himself ran some risk through the loss of a horse. When he\r\nsaw all his men in flight, he tore off his riding cloak and drawing his\r\nsword rushed among the fugitives, hoping either that they would be ashamed\r\nand turn back or that he might himself perish with them. Some did stop\r\nwhen they saw him in such an attitude, and turned back. Brought in this\r\nway face to face with the men close behind them they cut down not a few of\r\nthem, thinking them to be followers of Albinus, and routed all their\r\npursuers. At this moment the cavalry under Laetus came up from the side\r\nand decided the rest of the issue for them. Laetus, so long as the\r\nstruggle was close, remained inactive, hoping that both parties would be\r\ndestroyed and that whatever soldiers were left on both sides would give\r\nhim supreme authority. When, however, he saw Severus's party getting the\r\nupper hand, he contributed to the result. So it was that Severus\r\nconquered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--7--] Roman power had suffered a severe blow, since the numbers\r\nthat fell on each side were beyond reckoning. Many even of the victors\r\ndeplored the disaster, for the entire plain was seen to be covered with\r\nthe bodies of men and horses. Some of them lay there exhausted by many\r\nwounds, others thoroughly mangled, and still others unwounded but buried\r\nunder heaps. Weapons had been tossed about and blood flowed in streams,\r\neven swelling the rivers. Albinus took refuge in a house located near the\r\nRhone, but when he saw all its environs guarded, he slew himself. I am not\r\ntelling what Severus wrote about it, but what actually took place. The\r\nemperor after inspecting his body and feasting his eyes upon it to the\r\nfull while he let his tongue indulge in appropriate utterances, ordered\r\nit,--all but the head,--to be cast out, and that he sent to Rome to be\r\nexposed on a cross. As he showed clearly by this action that he was very\r\nfar from being an excellent ruler, he alarmed even more than before the\r\npopulace and us by the commands which he issued. Now that he had\r\nvanquished all forces under arms he poured out upon the unarmed all the\r\nwrath he had nourished against them during the previous period. He\r\nterrified us most of all by declaring himself the son of Marcus and\r\nbrother of Commodus; and to Commodus, whom but recently he was wont to\r\nabuse, he gave heroic honors. [Sidenote:--8--] While reading before the\r\nsenate a speech in which he praised the severity and cruelty of Sulla and\r\nMarius and Augustus as rather the safer course, and deprecated the\r\nclemency of Pompey and Caesar because it had proved their ruin, he\r\nintroduced a defence of Commodus, and inveighed against the senate for\r\ndishonoring him unjustly though the majority of their own body lived even\r\nworse lives. \"For if\", said he, \"this is abominable, that he with his own\r\nhands should have killed beasts, yet at Ostia yesterday or the day before\r\none of your number, an old man that had been consul, indulged publicly in\r\nplay with a prostitute who imitated a leopard. 'He fought as a gladiator,'\r\ndo you say? By Jupiter, does none of you fight as gladiator? If not, how\r\nis it and for what purpose that some persons have bought his shields and\r\nthe famous golden helmets?\" At the conclusion of this reading he released\r\nthirty-five prisoners charged with having taken Albinus's side and behaved\r\ntoward them as if they had incurred no charge at all. They were among the\r\nforemost members of the senate. He condemned to death twenty-nine men, as\r\none of whom was reckoned Sulpicianus, the father-in-law of Pertinax.\r\n\r\nAll pretended to sympathize with Severus but were confuted as often as a\r\nsudden piece of news arrived, not being able to conceal the sentiments\r\nhidden in their hearts. When off their guard they started at reports which\r\nhappened to assail their ears without warning. In such ways, as well as\r\nthrough facial expression and habits of behavior, the feelings of every\r\none of them became manifest. Some also by an excess of affectation only\r\nbetrayed their attitude the more.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LXXIV, 9, 5] Severus endeavored in the case of those who were\r\nreceiving vengeance at his hands [Lacuna] [Footnote: Some words appear to\r\nhave fallen out at this point (so Dindorf).] to employ Erucius Clarus\r\n[Footnote: _C. Iulius Erucius Clarus Vibianus_.] as informer\r\nagainst them, that he might both put the man in an unpleasant position and\r\nbe thought to have more fully justified conviction in view of his\r\nwitness's family and reputation. He promised Clarus to grant him safety\r\nand immunity. But when the latter chose rather to die than to make any\r\nsuch revelations, he turned to Julianus and persuaded him to play the\r\npart. For this willingness he released him in so far as not to kill nor\r\ndisenfranchise him; but he carefully verified all his statements by\r\ntortures and regarded as of no value his existing reputation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LXXV, 5] [In Britain at this period, because the Caledonians\r\ndid not abide by their promises but made preparations to aid the\r\nMaeatians, and because Severus at the time was attending to the war\r\nabroad, Lupus was compelled to purchase peace for the Maeatians at a high\r\nfigure, and recovered some few captives.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 198 (a.u. 951)] [Sidenote:--9--] The next thing Severus\r\ndid was to make a campaign against the Parthians. While he was busied with\r\ncivil wars, they had been free from molestation and had thus been able by\r\nan expedition in full force to capture Mesopotamia. They also came very\r\nnear reducing Nisbis, and would have done so, had not Laetus, who was\r\nbesieged there, preserved the place. Though previously noted for other\r\npolitical and private and public excellences, in peace as well as in wars,\r\nhe derived even greater glory from this exploit. Severus on reaching the\r\naforesaid Nisibis encountered an enormous boar. With its charge it killed\r\na horseman who, trusting to his own strength, attempted to run it down,\r\nand it was with difficulty stopped and killed by many soldiers,--thirty\r\nbeing the number required to stop it; the beast was then conveyed to\r\nSeverus.\r\n\r\nThe Parthians did not wait for him but retired homeward. (Their leader was\r\nVologaesus, whose brother was accompanying Severus). Hence Severus\r\nequipped boats on the Euphrates and reached him partly by marching, partly\r\nby sailing. The newly constructed vessels were exceedingly manageable and\r\nwell appointed, for the forest along the Euphrates and those regions in\r\ngeneral afforded the emperor an abundant supply of timber. Thus he soon\r\nhad seized Seleucia and Babylon, both of which had been abandoned.\r\nSubsequently he captured Ctesiphon and permitted his soldiers to plunder\r\nthe whole town, causing a great slaughter of men and taking nearly ten\r\nmyriads alive. However, he did not pursue Vologaesus nor yet occupy\r\nCtesiphon, but as if the sole purpose of his campaign had been to plunder\r\nit, he thereupon departed. This action was due partly to lack of\r\nacquaintance with the country and partly to dearth of provisions. His\r\nreturn was made by a different route, because the wood and fodder found on\r\nthe previous route had been exhausted. Some of his soldiers made their\r\nretreat by land along the Tigris, following the stream toward its source,\r\nand some on boats.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 199(?)] [Sidenote:--10--] Next, Severus crossed\r\nMesopotamia and made an attempt on Hatra, which was not far off, but\r\naccomplished nothing. In fact, even the engines were burned, many soldiers\r\nperished, and vast numbers were wounded. Therefore Severus retired from\r\nthe place and shifted his quarters. While he was at war, he also put to\r\ndeath two distinguished men. The first was Julius Crispus, a tribune of\r\nthe Pretorians. The cause of his execution was that indignant at the\r\ndamage done by the war he had casually uttered a verse of the poet Maro,\r\nin which one of the soldiers fighting on the side of Turnus against Aeneas\r\nbewails his lot and says: \"To enable Turnus to marry Lavinia we are\r\nmeanwhile perishing, without heed being paid to us.\" [Footnote: Two and a\r\nhalf lines beginning with verse 371 in Book Eleven of Virgil's Aeneid.]\r\nSeverus made Valerius, the soldier who had accused him, tribune in his\r\nplace. The other whom he killed was Laetus, and the reason was that Laetus\r\nwas proud and was beloved by the soldiers. They often said they would not\r\nmarch, unless Laetus would lead them. The responsibility for this murder,\r\nfor which he had no clear reason save jealousy, he fastened upon the\r\nsoldiers, making it appear that they had ventured upon the act contrary to\r\nhis will.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 200(?)] [Sidenote:--11--] After laying in a large store of\r\nfood and preparing many engines he in person again led an attack upon\r\nHatra. He deemed it a disgrace, now that other points had been subdued,\r\nthat this one alone, occupying a central position, should continue to\r\nresist. And he lost a large amount of money and all his engines except\r\nthose of Priscus, as I stated earlier, [Footnote: Compare Book\r\nSeventy-four, chapter 11.] besides many soldiers. Numbers were annihilated\r\nin foraging expeditions, as the barbarian cavalry (I mean that of the\r\nArabians) kept everywhere assailing them with precision and violence. The\r\narchery of the Atreni, too, was effective over a very long range. Some\r\nmissiles they hurled from engines, striking many of Severus's men-at-arms,\r\nfor they discharged two missiles in one and the same shot and there were\r\nalso many hands and many arrows to inflict injury. They did their\r\nassailants the utmost damage, however, when the latter approached the\r\nwall, and in an even greater degree after they had broken down a little of\r\nit. Then they threw at them among other things the bituminous naphtha of\r\nwhich I wrote above [Footnote: Compare the beginning of Book Thirty-six\r\n(supplied from Xiphilinus).] and set fire to the engines and all the\r\nsoldiers that were struck with it. Severus observed proceedings from a\r\nlofty tribunal. [Sidenote:--12--] A portion of the outer circuit had\r\nfallen in one place and all the soldiers were eager to force their way\r\ninside the remainder, when Severus checked them from doing so by giving\r\norders that the signal for retreat be sounded clearly on all sides. The\r\nfame of the place was great, since it contained enormous offerings to the\r\nSun God and vast stores of valuables; and he expected that the Arabians\r\nwould voluntarily come to terms in order to avoid being forcibly captured\r\nand enslaved. When, after letting one day elapse, no one made any formal\r\nproposition to him, he commanded the soldiers again to assault the wall,\r\nthough it had been built up in the night. The Europeans who had the power\r\nto accomplish something were so angry that not one of them would any\r\nlonger obey him, and some others, Syrians, compelled to go to the assault\r\nin their stead, were miserably destroyed. Thus Heaven, that rescued the\r\ncity, caused Severus to recall the soldiers that could have entered it,\r\nand in turn when he later wished to take it caused the soldiers to prevent\r\nhim from doing so. The situation placed Severus in such a dilemma that\r\nwhen some one of his followers promised him that, if he would give him\r\nonly five hundred and fifty of the Europeans, he would get possession of\r\nthe city without any risk to the rest, the emperor said within hearing of\r\nall: \"And where can I get so many soldiers?\" (referring to the\r\ndisobedience of the soldiers).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 200 (a.u. 953)] [Sidenote:--13--] Having prosecuted the\r\nsiege for twenty days he next came to Palestine and sacrificed to the\r\nspirit of Pompey: and into [upper] Egypt [he sailed along the Nile and\r\nviewed the whole country, with some small exceptions. For instance, he was\r\nunable to pass the frontier of Ethiopia on account of pestilence.] And he\r\nmade a search of everything, including what was very carefully hidden, for\r\nhe was the sort of man to leave nothing, human or divine, uninvestigated.\r\nFollowing this tendency he drew from practically all their hiding places\r\nall the books that he could find containing anything secret, and he closed\r\nthe monument of Alexander, to the end that no one should either behold his\r\nbody any more or read what was written in these books.\r\n\r\nThis was what he did. For myself, there is no need that I should write in\r\ngeneral about Egypt, but what I know about the Nile through verifying\r\nstatements from many sources I am bound to mention. It clearly rises in\r\nMount Atlas. This lies in Macennitis, close to the Western ocean itself,\r\nand towers far above all mountains, wherefore the poets have called it\r\n\"Pillar of the Sky.\" No one ever ascended its summits nor saw its topmost\r\npeaks. Hence it is always covered with snow, which in summer time sends\r\ndown great quantities of water. The whole country about its base is in\r\ngeneral marshy, but at this season becomes even more so, with the result\r\nthat it swells the size of the Nile at harvest time. This is the river's\r\nsource, as is evidenced by the crocodiles and other beasts that are born\r\nalike on both sides of it. Let no one be surprised that we have made\r\npronouncements unknown to the ancient Greeks. The Macennitae live near\r\nlower Mauretania and many of the people who go on campaigns there also\r\nvisit Atlas. It is thus that the matter stands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--14--] Plautianus, who enjoyed the special favor of Severus and\r\nhad the authority of prefect, besides possessing the fullest and greatest\r\ninfluence on earth, had put to death many men of renown and his own\r\npeers [Lacuna] [After killing Aemilius Saturninus he took away all the\r\nmost important prerogatives belonging to the minor officers of the\r\nPretorians, his subordinates, in order that none of them might be so\r\nelated by his position of eminence as to lie in wait for the captaincy of\r\nthe body-guards. Already it was his wish to be not simply the only but a\r\nperpetual prefect.] He wanted everything, asked everything from everybody,\r\nand got everything. He left no province and no city unplundered, but\r\nsacked and gathered everything from all sides. All sent a great deal more\r\nto him than they did to Severus. Finally he sent centurions and stole\r\ntiger-striped horses sacred [Footnote: Supplying [Greek: therous] (Reiske's\r\nconjecture).] to the Sun God from the island in the Red Sea. This mere\r\nstatement, I think, must instantly make plain all his officiousness and\r\ngreediness. Yet, on second thought, I will add one thing more. At home he\r\ncastrated one hundred nobly born Roman citizens, though none of us knew of\r\nit until after he was dead. From this fact one may comprehend the extent\r\nalike of his lawlessness and of his authority. He castrated not merely\r\nboys or youths, but grown men, some of whom had wives; his object was that\r\nPlautilla his daughter (whom Antoninus afterward married) should be waited\r\nupon entirely by eunuchs [and also have them to give her instruction in\r\nmusic and other branches of art. So we beheld the same persons eunuchs and\r\nmen, fathers and impotent, gelded and bearded. In view of this one might\r\nnot improperly declare that Plautianus had power beyond all men, over even\r\nthe emperors themselves. For one thing, his portrait statues were not only\r\nfar more numerous but also larger than theirs, and this not simply in\r\noutside cities but in Rome itself, and they were at this time reared not\r\nmerely by individuals but by no less a body than the senate itself. All\r\nthe soldiers and the senators took oaths by his Fortune and all publicly\r\noffered prayer for his preservation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--15--] The person principally responsible for this state of\r\naffairs was Severus himself. He yielded to Plautianus in all matters to\r\nsuch a degree that the latter occupied the position of emperor and he\r\nhimself that of prefect. In short, the man knew absolutely everything that\r\nSeverus said and did, but not a person was acquainted with any of\r\nPlautianus's secrets. The emperor made advances to his daughter on behalf\r\nof his own son, passing by many other maidens of high rank. He appointed\r\nhim consul and virtually showed an anxiety to have him for successor in\r\nthe imperial office. Indeed, once he did say in a letter: \"I love the man\r\nso much that I pray to die before he does.\"]\r\n\r\n[Lacuna] so that [Lacuna] some one actually dared to write to him as to a\r\nfourth Caesar.\r\n\r\nThough many decrees in his honor were passed by the senate he accepted\r\nonly a few of them, saying to the senators: \"It is through your hearts\r\nthat you show your love for me, not through your decrees.\"\r\n\r\nAt temporary stopping-places he endured seeing him located in superior\r\nquarters and enjoying better and more abundant food than he. Hence in\r\nNicaea (my native country) when he once wanted a hammer-fish, large\r\nspecimens of which are found in the lake, he sent to Plautianus to get it.\r\nSo if he thought at all of doing aught to diminish this minister's\r\nleadership, yet the opposite party, which contained far greater and more\r\nbrilliant members, saw to it that any such plan was frustrated. On one\r\noccasion Severus went to visit him, when he had fallen sick at Tyana, and\r\nthe soldiers attached to Plautianus would not allow the visitor's escort\r\nto enter with him. Moreover, the person who arranged cases to be pled\r\nbefore Severus was once ordered by the latter in a moment of leisure to\r\nbring forward some case or other, whereupon the fellow refused, saying: \"I\r\ncan not do this, unless Plautianus bid me.\" So greatly did Plautianus have\r\nthe mastery in every way over the emperor that he [frequently treated]\r\nJulia Augusta [in an outrageous way,--for he detested her cordially,--and]\r\nwas always abusing [her violently] to Severus, and conducted\r\ninvestigations against her as well as tortures of noble women. For this\r\nreason she began to study philosophy and passed her days in the company of\r\nlearned men.--As for Plautianus, he proved himself the most licentious of\r\nmen, for he would go to banquets and vomit meantime, inasmuch as the mass\r\nof foods and wine that he swallowed made it impossible for him to digest\r\nanything. And whereas he made use of lads and girls in perfectly notorious\r\nfashion, he would not permit his own wife to see or be seen by any person\r\nwhomsoever, not even by Severus or Julia [to say nothing of others].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--16--] At this period there took place also a gymnastic\r\n[Footnote: Reading [Greek: gymnikon] for [Greek: gynaikon], which is\r\npossibly corrupt.] contest, at which so great a multitude assembled under\r\ncompulsion that we wondered how the race-course could hold them all. And\r\nin this contest Alamanni [Footnote: Reading [Greek: Alamannai] for [Greek:\r\nalomenai], which is undoubtedly corrupt.] women fought most ferociously,\r\nwith the result that jokes were made about other ladies, who were very\r\ndistinguished. Therefore, from this time on every woman, no matter what\r\nher origin, was prohibited from fighting in the arena.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion a good many images of Plautianus were made (what happened\r\nis worth relating) and Severus, being displeased at their number, melted\r\ndown some of them. As a consequence a rumor penetrated the cities to the\r\neffect that the prefect had been overthrown and had perished. So some of\r\nthem demolished his images,--an act for which they were afterward\r\npunished. Among these was the governor of Sardinia, Racius Constans, a\r\nvery famous man, whom I have mentioned, however, for a particular reason.\r\nThe orator who accused Constans had made this statement in addition to\r\nothers: \"Sooner may the sky collapse than Plautianus suffer any harm at\r\nthe hands of Severus, and with greater cause might any one believe even\r\nthat report, were any story of the sort circulated.\" Now, though the\r\norator made this declaration, and though moreover Severus himself volubly\r\naffirmed it to us, who were helping him try the case, and stated \"it is\r\nimpossible for Plautianus to come to any harm at my hands,\" still, this\r\nvery Plautianus did not live the year out, but was slain and all his\r\nimages destroyed.--Previous to this a vast sea-monster had come ashore in\r\nthe harbor named for Augustus, and had been captured. A representation of\r\nhim, taken into the hunting-theatre, admitted fifty bears in its interior.\r\nAgain, for many days a comet star had been seen in Rome and was said to\r\nportend nothing favorable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIO'S ROMAN HISTORY\r\n77\r\n\r\nFestivities on account of Severus's decennial, the marriage of Antoninus\r\nand victories (chapter 1).\r\n\r\nDeath of Plautianus (chapters 2-4).\r\n\r\nThe friends and children of Plautianus are persecuted by Severus (chapters\r\n5-9).\r\n\r\nAbout Bulla Felix, a noble brigand (chapter 10).\r\n\r\nSeverus's campaign in Britain: an account of the Britons (chapters 11,\r\n12).\r\n\r\nAfter traversing the whole of Britain Severus makes peace (chapter 13).\r\n\r\nHow Antoninus desired to slay his father (chapter 14).\r\n\r\nDeath of Severus Augustus and a summary view of his life (chapters 15-17).\r\n\r\n\r\nDURATION OF TIME.\r\n\r\nL.

He took the greatest delight in\r\nthis achievement, and, as a matter of fact, no one had ever before given\r\nso much to whole masses of people. Upon this gift five hundred myriads of\r\ndenarii were expended. Another event was the marriage between Antoninus,\r\nson of Severus, and Plautilla, the daughter of Plautianus. The latter gave\r\nas much for his daughter's dowry as would have sufficed for fifty women of\r\nroyal rank. We saw the gifts as they were being carried through the Forum\r\ninto the palace. We were banqueted, likewise, in the meantime, partly in\r\nroyal and partly in barbarian fashion on whatever is regularly eaten\r\ncooked or raw, and we received other animal food also alive. At this time,\r\ntoo, there occurred all sorts of spectacles in honor of Severus's return,\r\nthe completion of his first decade, and his victories. At these spectacles\r\nsixty wild boars of Plautianus upon a given signal began a combat with one\r\nanother, and there were slain (besides many other beasts) an elephant and\r\na crocotta. [Footnote: Hesychius says of this beast merely that it is a\r\nquadruped of Aethiopia. Strabo calls it a cross between wolf and dog.\r\nPliny (Natural History, VIII, 21 (30)) gives the following description:\r\n\r\n  \"Crocottas are apparently the offspring of dog and wolf; they crush all\r\n  their food with their teeth and forthwith gulp it down to be assimilated\r\n  by the belly.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, of the Leucrocotta:\r\n\r\n  \"A most destructive beast about the size of an ass, with legs of a deer,\r\n  the neck, tail and breast of a lion, a badger's head, cloven hoof, mouth\r\n  slit to the ears, and, in place of teeth, a solid line of bone.\"\r\n\r\nAlso, in VIII, 30 (45), he says:\r\n\r\n  \"The lioness of Ethiopia by copulation with a hyaena brings forth the\r\n  crocotta.\"\r\n\r\nCapitolinus (Life of Antoninus Pius, 10, 9) remarks that the first\r\nAntoninus had exhibited the animal in Rome. Further, see Aelian, VII, 22.]\r\nThe last named animal is of Indian origin, and was then for the first\r\ntime, so far as I am aware, introduced into Rome. It has the skin of lion\r\nand tiger mingled and the appearance of those animals, as also of the wolf\r\nand fox, curiously blended. The entire cage in the theatre had been so\r\nconstructed as to resemble a boat in form, so that it would both receive\r\nand discharge four hundred beasts at once, [Footnote: These cages were\r\noften made in various odd shapes and opened automatically. Compare the\r\nclosing sentences of the preceding book.] and then, as it suddenly fell\r\napart, there came rushing up bears, lionesses, panthers, lions, ostriches,\r\nwild asses, bisons (this is a kind of cattle of foreign species and\r\nappearance),--the result being that altogether seven hundred wild and tame\r\nbeasts at once were seen running about and were slaughtered. For, to\r\ncorrespond with the duration of the festival, seven days, the number of\r\nanimals was also seven times one hundred.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--2--] On Mount Vesuvius a great gush of fire burst out and\r\nthere were bellowings mighty enough to be heard in Capua, where I live\r\nwhenever I am in Italy. This place I have selected for various reasons,\r\nchief of which is its quiet, that enables me to get leisure from city\r\naffairs and to write on this compilation. As a result of the Vesuvian\r\nphenomena it was believed that there would be a change in the political\r\nstatus of Plautianus. In very truth Plautianus had grown great and more\r\nthan great, so that even the populace at the hippodrome exclaimed: \"Why do\r\nyou tremble? Why are you pale? You possess more than the three.\" They did\r\nnot say this to his face, of course, but differently. And by \"three\" they\r\nindicated Severus and his sons, Antoninus and Geta. Plautianus's pallor\r\nand his trembling were in fact due to the life that he lived, the hopes\r\nthat he hoped, and the fears that he feared. Still, for a time most of\r\nthis eluded Severus's individual notice, or else he knew it but pretended\r\nthe opposite. When, however, his brother Geta on his deathbed revealed to\r\nhim the whole attitude of Plautianus,--for Geta hated the prefect and now\r\nno longer feared him,--the emperor set up a bronze statue of his brother\r\nin the Forum and no longer held his minister in equal honor; indeed, the\r\nlatter was stripped of most of his power. Hence [Sidenote: A.D. 203 (a.u.\r\n956)] Plautianus became violently enraged, and whereas he had formerly\r\nhated Antoninus for slighting his daughter, he was now especially\r\nindignant, feeling that his son-in-law was responsible for his present\r\ndisgrace, and began to behave more harshly toward him. [Sidenote:--3--]\r\nFor these reasons Antoninus became both disgusted with his wife (who was a\r\nmost shameless creature), and offended at her father himself, because the\r\nlatter kept meddling in all his undertakings and rebuking him for\r\neverything that he did. Conceiving a desire to be rid of the man in some\r\nway or other he accordingly had Euodus, his nurse, persuade a certain\r\ncenturion, Saturninus, and two others of similar rank to bring him word\r\nthat Plautianus had ordered some ten centurions, to whose number they also\r\nbelonged, to kill both Severus and Antoninus; and they read a certain\r\nwriting which they pretended to have received bearing upon this very\r\nmatter. This was done as a surprise at the observances held in the palace\r\nin honor of the heroes, at a time when the spectacle had ceased and dinner\r\nwas about to be served. That fact was largely instrumental in showing the\r\nstory to be a fabrication. Plautianus would never have dared to impose\r\nsuch a bidding upon ten centurions at once, certainly not in Rome,\r\ncertainly not in the palace, nor on that day, nor at that hour; much less\r\nwould he have written it. Nevertheless, Severus believed the information\r\ntrustworthy because he had the night before seen in a dream Albinus alive\r\nand plotting against him. [Sidenote:--4--] In haste, therefore, he\r\nsummoned Plautianus, as if upon some other business. The latter hurried so\r\n(or rather, Heaven so indicated to him approaching disaster) that the\r\nmules that were carrying him fell in the palace yard. And when he sought\r\nto enter, the porters in charge of the bolts admitted him alone inside and\r\nwould permit no one to enter with him, just as he himself had done in the\r\ncase of Severus at Tyana. He grew a little suspicious at this and became\r\nterrified; as he had, however, no pretext for withdrawing, he went in.\r\nSeverus conversed with him very mildly: \"Why have you seen fit to do this!\r\nFor what reason have you wished to kill us?\" He gave him opportunity to\r\nspeak and prepared to listen to his defence.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the accused's denial and surprise at what was said,\r\nAntoninus rushed up, took away his sword, and struck him with his fist. He\r\nwas ready to put an end to Plautianus with his own hand after the latter\r\nsaid: \"You wanted to get the start of me in any killing!\" Being prevented,\r\nhowever, by his father, Antoninus ordered one of his attendants to slay\r\nPlautianus. Somebody plucked out a few hairs from his chin and carried\r\nthem to Julia and Plautilla (who were together) before they had heard a\r\nword of the affair, and said: \"Behold your Plautianus!\" This speech\r\naroused grief in one and joy in the other.\r\n\r\nThus the man who had possessed the greatest influence of all my\r\ncontemporaries, so that everybody both feared and trembled before him more\r\nthan before the very emperors, [Footnote: Reading [Greek: autokratoron]\r\n(emendation of H. Stephanus).] the man who had hung poised upon greater\r\nhopes than they, was slain by his son-in-law and thrown from the top of\r\nthe palace into some street. Later, at the order of Severus, he was taken\r\nup and buried.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--5--] Severus next called a meeting of the senate in the\r\nsenate-house. He uttered no accusation against Plautianus, but himself\r\ndeplored the weakness of human nature, which was not able to endure\r\nexcessive honors, and blamed himself that he had so honored and loved the\r\nman. Those, however, who had informed him of the victim's plot he bade\r\ntell us everything; but first he expelled from the senate-chamber some\r\nwhose presence was not necessary, and by revealing nothing to them\r\nintimated that he did not altogether trust them.\r\n\r\nMany were brought into danger by the Plautianus episode and some actually\r\nlost their lives. But Coeranus was accustomed to declare (what most people\r\nare given to pretending with reference to the fortunate) that he was his\r\nassociate. As often as these friends of the prefect were wont to be called\r\nin before the others desiring to greet the great man, it was his custom to\r\naccompany them as far as the bars. So he did not share his secrets, but\r\nremained in the space midway, giving Plautianus the impression that he was\r\noutside and those outside the idea that he was within. This caused him to\r\nbe the object of greater suspicion,--a feeling which was strengthened by\r\nthe fact that Plautianus once in a dream saw fishes issue from the Tiber\r\nand fall at his feet, whereupon he declared that Coeranus should rule the\r\nland and water. This man, after being confined to an island for seven\r\nyears, was later recalled, was the first Egyptian to be enrolled in the\r\nsenate, and became consul, like Pompey, without holding any previous\r\noffice. Caecilius Agricola, however, numbered among the deceased's\r\nforemost flatterers and second to no man on earth in rascality and\r\nlicentiousness, was sentenced to death. He went home, and after drinking\r\nhis fill of chilled wine, shattered the cup which had cost him five\r\nmyriads, and cutting his veins fell dead upon the fragments.\r\n[Sidenote:--6--] As for Saturninus and Euodus, they were honored at the\r\ntime but were later executed by Antoninus. While we were engaged in voting\r\neulogies to Euodus, Severus restrained us by saying: \"It is disgraceful\r\nthat in one of your decrees there should be inscribed such a statement\r\nrespecting a man that is a Caesarian.\" It was not the only instance of\r\nsuch an attitude, but he also refused to allow all the other imperial\r\nfreedmen either to be insolent or to swagger; for this he was commended.\r\nThe senate once, while chanting his praises, uttered without reserve no\r\nless a sentiment than this: \"All do all things well since you rule well!\"\r\n\r\nPlautilla and Plautius, the children of Plautianus, were temporarily\r\nallowed to live, being banished to Lipara; but in the reign of Antoninus\r\nthey were destroyed, though they had been existing in great fear and\r\nwretchedness and though their life was not even blessed by a goodly store\r\nof necessities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--7--] The sons of Severus, Antoninus and Greta, felt as if they\r\nhad got rid of a pedagogue in Plautianus, and their conduct was from this\r\ntime on irresponsible. They outraged women and abused boys, they embezzled\r\nmoneys and made friends of the gladiators and charioteers, emulating each\r\nother in the similarity of their deeds and full of strife in their\r\nrespective rivalries. If one attached himself to any cause, the other\r\nwould be sure to choose the opposite side. Finally, they were pitted\r\nagainst each other in some kind of exercise with teams of ponies and drove\r\nwith such fierce opposition that Antoninus fell out of the two-wheeled car\r\nand broke his leg. [During his son's sickness that followed this accident\r\nSeverus neglected not one of his duties, but held court and managed all\r\naffairs pertaining to his office. For this he was praised. But he was\r\nblamed for murdering Plautianus Quintillus. [Footnote: This person's name\r\nis properly _M. Plautius Quintillus_.] He executed also many of the\r\nsenators, some of whom had been accused before him, and made their defence\r\nand had been convicted. But Quintillus,] a man of noblest birth, for a\r\nlong term of years counted among the foremost members of the senate,\r\nstanding at the gates of old age, one who lived in the country, interfered\r\nin no one's business and did naught amiss, nevertheless became the prey of\r\nsycophants and was put out of the way. As he was near death he called for\r\nhis funeral garments, which he had long since kept in readiness. On seeing\r\nthat they had fallen to pieces through lapse of time, he said: \"Why did we\r\ndelay this!\" And as he perfumed the place with burning incense, he\r\nremarked: \"I offer the same prayer as Servianus offered over Hadrian.\"\r\n[Footnote: Compare Book Sixty-nine, chapter 17.]--Besides his death there\r\nwere also gladiatorial contests, in which among other features ten tigers\r\nwere slaughtered at once.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--8--] After this came the _dénouement_ of the Apronianus\r\naffair,--a startling story even in the hearing. He incurred censure\r\nbecause his nurse is said to have seen once in a vision that he should\r\nenjoy sovereignty, and because he was believed to employ some magic to\r\nthis end. He was condemned while absent in his governorship of Asia. When\r\nthe evidence taken in his case was read to us, there was found written\r\nthere this statement,--that one person in charge of the investigation had\r\nenquired who had told the dream and who had heard it, and that the man\r\ninterrogated had said among other things: \"I saw a certain baldheaded\r\nsenator taking a peep there.\" On hearing this we all became\r\nterror-stricken, for neither had the man spoken nor Severus written any\r\none's name. In their state of panic even those who had never visited the\r\nhouse of Apronianus, and not only the baldheaded but those whose foreheads\r\nwere indifferently bare grew afraid. No one felt easy save those who had\r\nunusually thick hair. We all looked around at such men, and a whisper ran\r\nabout: \"It's so-and-so. No, it's so-and-so.\" I will not conceal how I was\r\nthen affected, however absurd it may be. I felt with my hand to see\r\nwhether I had any hair on my head; and a number of others behaved in the\r\nvery same way. We were very careful to direct our gaze upon baldish\r\npersons as if we could thereby divert our own danger upon them. This we\r\ndid until it was further read that the particular baldhead in question\r\nwore a purple toga. When this statement came out, we turned our eyes upon\r\nBaebius Marcellinus. He had been aedile at the time and was extremely\r\nbald. So he stood up and coming forward said: \"He will certainly be able\r\nto point me out, if he has seen me.\" We commended this speech, the\r\ninformer was brought in while the senator stood by, and for a long time\r\nwas silent, looking about for the man to point out. Finally, following the\r\ndirection of an almost imperceptible nod that somebody gave, he said that\r\nthis was he.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--9--] Thus was Marcellinus convicted of a baldhead's peeping,\r\n[Footnote: The phrase [Greek: phalakrou parakupseos] has a humorous ring\r\nto it, and I am inclined to believe, especially considering the situation,\r\nthat Dio had in his mind while writing this the familiar proverb [Greek:\r\nhonou parakupseos], a famous response given by a careless ass-driver,\r\nwhose animal being several rods in advance of its lagging master had stuck\r\nits head into an open doorway and thereby scattered the nucleus of a\r\npromising aviary. The fellow was haled to court to answer to a charge of\r\ncontributory negligence and when some bystander asked him for what misdeed\r\nhe had been brought to that place, he rejoined with a great air of injured\r\ninnocence: \"For an ass's peeping!\"] and bewailing his fate he was\r\nconducted out of the senate-house. When he had passed through the Forum,\r\nhe refused to advance farther, but right where he was took leave of his\r\nchildren, four in number, and uttered this most affecting speech: \"There\r\nis only one thing that I am sorry for, children; it is that I must leave\r\nyou behind alive.\" Then he had his head cut off before Severus learned\r\neven that he had been condemned.\r\n\r\nJust vengeance, however, befell Pollenius Sebennus, who had preferred the\r\ncharge that caused his death. He was delivered by Sabinus to the Norici,\r\nfor whom he had shown scant consideration during his governorship of them,\r\nand went through a most disgraceful experience. We saw him stretched on\r\nthe ground, pleading piteously, and had he not obtained mercy, thanks to\r\nhis uncle Auspex, [Footnote: _A. Pollenius Auspex_.] he would have\r\nperished pitiably. This Auspex was the cleverest imaginable man for jokes\r\nand chit-chat, for despising all mankind, gratifying his friends, and\r\nmaking reprisals upon his enemy. Many bitter and witty epigrams of his\r\nspoken to various people are reported, and many to Severus himself. Here\r\nis one of the latter. When the emperor was enrolled in the family of\r\nMarcus, Auspex said: \"I congratulate you, Caesar, upon having found a\r\nfather.\" This implied that up to this time his obscure origin had made him\r\nas good as fatherless.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 206-7(?)] [Sidenote:--10--] It was at this period that one\r\nBulla, an Italian, established a robber band of about six hundred men and\r\nfor two years continued to plunder Italy under the very noses of the\r\nemperors and of so great bodies of soldiers. Pursuit was instituted by\r\nnumerous persons, and Severus emulously followed his trail, but the fellow\r\nwas never really seen when seen, never found when found, never apprehended\r\nwhen caught. This was due to his great bribes and his cleverness. He got\r\nwind of everybody that was setting out from Rome and everybody that was\r\nputting into port at Brundusium, learning who and how many they were, and\r\nwhat and how much they had with them. His general method was to take a\r\npart of what they had and then let them go at once. Artisans, however, he\r\ndetained for a time and after making use of their skill dismissed them\r\nwith something extra as a present. Once two of his robbers had been\r\ncaptured and were to be given to beasts, whereupon the chief paid a visit\r\nto the keeper of the prison, pretending that he was the governor of his\r\nnative place (?) and needed some such men, and in this way he secured and\r\nsaved them. Again, he approached the centurion who was charged with\r\nabolishing brigandage and in disguise accused his own self; he further\r\npromised, if the centurion would accompany him, to deliver the robber to\r\nhim. So, pretending that he was leading him to Felix (this was another\r\nname of the chief), he brought him to a hill-encompassed spot, suitable\r\nfor ambuscade, and easily seized him. Later he assumed the garb of a\r\nmagistrate, ascended the tribunal, and having called the centurion caused\r\nhis head to be shaved, and said: \"Take this message to your masters: 'Feed\r\nyour slaves, if you want to make an end of brigandage.'\" Bulla had,\r\nindeed, a very great number of Caesarians, some who had been poorly paid\r\nand some who had gone absolutely without pay.\r\n\r\nSeverus, informed of these events one at a time, was moved to anger to\r\nthink that while having other men win victory in warfare in Britain, he\r\nhimself in Italy had proved no match for a robber. At last he despatched a\r\ntribune from his body-guard with many horsemen and threatened him with\r\nterrible punishments if he should not bring the culprit alive. Then this\r\ncommander ascertained that the chief was maintaining relations of intimacy\r\nwith the wife of another, and through the agency of her husband persuaded\r\nher on promise of immunity to cooperate with them. As a result the elusive\r\nleader was arrested while asleep in a cave. Papinianus the prefect asked\r\nhim: \"For what reason did you become a robber?\" The other rejoined: \"For\r\nwhat reason are you a prefect?\" And thereafter by solemn proclamation he\r\nwas given to beasts. His robber band broke up, for the entire strength of\r\nthe six hundred lay in him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A.D. 208 (a.u. 961)] [Sidenote:--11--] Severus, seeing that his\r\nchildren were departing from their accustomed modes of life and that his\r\nlegions were becoming enervated by idleness, set out on a campaign against\r\nBritain, though he knew that he should not return. He knew this chiefly\r\nfrom the stars under which he had been born, for he had them painted upon\r\nthe ceilings of the two halls in the palace where he was wont to hold\r\ncourt. Thus they were visible to all, save the portion which\r\n\"regarded-the-hour\" when he first saw the light (i.e., his horo-scope).\r\nThis he had not engraved in the same way in both the rooms.--He knew it\r\nalso by the report of the seers. And a thunderbolt struck a statue of his\r\nstanding near the gates through which he intended to march out and looking\r\noff along the road leading to his destination, and it had erased three\r\nletters from his name. For this reason, [Footnote: The significance of\r\nthis happening is explained as follows. Taking the Greek form of Severus,\r\nnamely [Greek: SEBAEROS] and erasing the first three letters you have left\r\n[Greek: AEROS]= [Greek: AEROS]=heros, \"hero.\" When a thunderbolt\r\nsubstitutes the word \"hero\" for the emperor's name, the supposition\r\nnaturally arises that the ruler will soon be numbered among the heroes,\r\nthat is, that he will cease to exist as a mortal man.] as the seers\r\nindicated, he did not come back again but departed from life two years\r\nafter this. He took with him very great sums of money.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--12--] There are two principal races of the Britons,--the\r\nCaledonians and the Maeatians. The titles of the rest have all been\r\nreduced to these two. The Maeatians live near the cross wall which cuts\r\nthe island in two, and the Caledonians are behind them. Both inhabit wild\r\nand waterless mountains, desolate and swampy plains, holding no walls, nor\r\ncities, nor tilled fields, but living by pasturage and hunting and a few\r\nfruit trees. The fish, which are inexhaustible and past computing for\r\nmultitude, they do not taste. They dwell coatless and shoeless in tents,\r\npossess their women in common, and rear all the offspring as a community.\r\nTheir form of government is mostly democratic and they are very fond of\r\nplundering.\r\n\r\nConsequently they choose their boldest spirits as leaders. They go into\r\nbattle on chariots with small, swift horses. There are also infantry, very\r\nquick at running and very firm in standing their ground. Their weapons are\r\nshield and short spear, with a bronze apple attached to the end of the\r\nground-spike, so that when the instrument is shaken it may clash and\r\ninspire the enemy with terror. They also have daggers. They can endure\r\nhunger and cold and any kind of wretchedness. They plunge into the swamps\r\nand exist there for many days with only their heads above water, and in\r\nthe forests they support themselves upon bark and roots and in all\r\n[Footnote: The reading is a little doubtful. Possibly \"in such cases\" (\r\n[Greek: para tauta]). (Boissevain).] cases they have ready a kind of food\r\nof which a piece the size of a bean when eaten prevents them from being\r\neither hungry or thirsty. Of such a nature is the island of Britain, and\r\nsuch are the inhabitants that the enemy's country has. For it is an\r\nisland, and the fact (as I have stated) [Footnote: Compare Book\r\nThirty-nine, chapter 50, which, in turn, refers to Book Sixty-six, chapter\r\n20.] was clearly proved at this time. The length of it is seven thousand\r\none hundred and thirty-two stades. Its greatest breadth is two thousand\r\nthree hundred and ten, and its least is three hundred. [Sidenote:--13--]\r\nOf all this we hold a little less than a half. So Severus, desiring to\r\nsubjugate the whole of it, invaded Caledonia. While traversing the\r\nterritory he had untold trouble in cutting down the forests, reducing the\r\nlevels of heights, filling up the swamps, and bridging the rivers. He\r\nfought no battle and beheld no adversary in battle array. The enemy\r\npurposely put sheep and cattle in front of them for the soldiers to seize,\r\nin order that the latter might be deceived for a longer time and wear\r\nthemselves out. The Romans received great damage from the streams and were\r\nmade objects of attack when they were scattered. Afterward, being unable\r\nto walk, they were slain by their own friends to avoid capture, so that\r\nnearly as many as fifty thousand died.\r\n\r\nBut the emperor did not desist till he had approached the extremity of the\r\nisland. Here he observed very accurately to how slight a degree the sun\r\ndeclined below the horizon [Footnote: Compare Tacitus, _Agricola_,\r\nchapter 12 (two sentences, Dierum [Lacuna] affirmant).] and the length of\r\ndays and nights both summer and winter. Thus having been conveyed through\r\npractically the whole of the hostile region,--for he was really conveyed\r\nin a covered chair most of the way on account of his weakness,--he\r\nreturned to [Sidenote: A.D. 210 (a.u. 963)] friendly territory, first\r\nforcing the Britons to come to terms on condition that he should abandon a\r\ngood part of their territory.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--14--] Antoninus also disturbed him and involved him in vain\r\nworry by his intemperate life, by his evident intention to murder his\r\nbrother if the chance should present itself, and finally by plotting\r\nagainst his own father. Once he leaped suddenly out of his quarters,\r\nshouting and bawling and feigning to have been wronged by Castor. This man\r\nwas the best of the Caesarians attending upon Severus, had been trusted\r\nwith his opinions, and had been assigned the duties of chamberlain.\r\nCertain soldiers with whom previous arrangements had been made hereupon\r\ngathered and joined the outcry; but they were checked in short order, as\r\nSeverus himself appeared on the scene and punished the more unruly among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion both were riding to meet the Caledonians for the\r\npurpose of receiving them and holding a conference about a truce, and\r\nAntoninus undertook to kill his father outright with his own hand. They\r\nwere going along on their horses, for Severus, although his feet were\r\nrather shrunken [Footnote: Reading [Greek: hypotetaekos] (suggestion of\r\nBoissevain, who does not regard Naber's emendation, Mnemosyne, XVI, p.\r\n113, as feasible).] by an ailment, nevertheless was on horseback himself\r\nand the rest of the army was following: the enemy's force, too, was\r\nlikewise a spectator. At this juncture, in the midst of the silence and\r\norder, Antoninus reined up his horse and drew his sword, apparently\r\nintending to strike his father in the back. Seeing this, the other\r\nhorsemen in the detachment raised a cry of alarm, which scared the son, so\r\nthat he did nothing further. Severus turned at their shout and saw the\r\nsword; however, he uttered not a syllable but ascended the tribunal,\r\nfinished what he had to do, and returned to the general's tent. Then he\r\ncalled his son and Papinianus and Castor, ordered a sword to be placed\r\nwithin easy reach, and upbraided the youth for having dared to do such a\r\nthing at all and especially for having been on the point of committing so\r\ngreat a crime in the presence of all the allies and the enemy. Finally he\r\nsaid: \"Now if you desire to slay me and have done, put an end to me here.\r\nYou are strong: I am an old man and prostrate. If you have no objection to\r\nthis, but shrink from becoming my actual murderer, there stands by your\r\nside Papinianus the prefect, whom you may order to put me out of the way.\r\nHe will certainly do anything that you command, since you are emperor.\"\r\nThough he spoke in this fashion, he still did the plotter no harm, in\r\nspite of the fact that he had often blamed Marcus for not ending the life\r\nof Commodus and that he had himself often threatened his son with this\r\ntreatment. Such words, however, were invariably spoken in a fit of anger:\r\non this occasion he allowed his love of offspring to get the better of his\r\nlove of country; yet in doing so he simply betrayed his other child, for\r\nhe well knew what would happen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--15--] Upon another revolt of the inhabitants of the island he\r\nsummoned the soldiers and bade them invade the rebels' country, killing\r\nwhomsoever they should encounter. He added these verses:\r\n\r\n  \"Let none escape utter destruction At our hands. Yea, whatso is found in\r\n  the womb of the mother, Child unborn though it be, let it not escape\r\n  utter destruction!\" [Footnote: Homer's Iliad, VI, verse 57, with a\r\n  slight change at the end.]\r\n\r\nWhen this had been done and the Caledonians as well as the Maeatians\r\nrevolted, he proceeded with preparations to make war upon them in person.\r\nWhile he was thus engaged his sickness carried him off on the fourth of\r\nFebruary. [Sidenote: A.D. 211 (a.u. 964)] Antoninus, it is said,\r\ncontributed something to the result. Before he closed his eyes he is\r\nreputed to have spoken these words to his children (I shall use the exact\r\nphraseology without embellishment): \"Be harmonious, enrich the soldiers,\r\nscorn everybody else.\" After this his body arrayed in military garb was\r\nplaced upon a pyre, and as a mark of honor the soldiers and his children\r\nran about it. Those present who had any military gifts threw them upon it\r\nand the sons applied the fire. Later his bones were put in a jar of purple\r\nstone, conveyed to Rome, and deposited in the tomb of the Antonines. It is\r\nsaid that Severus sent for the jar a little before his death and after\r\nfeeling it over remarked: \"Thou shalt hold a man that the world could not\r\nhold.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--16--] He was slow-moulded but strong, though he eventually\r\ngrew very weak from gout: mentally he was very keen and very firm. He\r\nwished for more education than he got and for this reason he was sagacious\r\nrather than a good talker. Toward friends not forgetful, to enemies most\r\noppressive, he was capable of everything that he desired to accomplish but\r\ncareless of everything said about him. Hence he gathered money from every\r\nsource (save that he killed no one to get it) [and met all necessary\r\nexpenditures quite ungrudgingly. He restored very many of the ancient\r\nbuildings and inscribed upon them his own name to signify that he had\r\nrepaired them so as to be new structures, and from his private funds. Also\r\nhe spent a great deal uselessly upon renovating and repairing other\r\nplaces], erecting, for instance, to Bacchus and Hercules a temple of huge\r\nsize. Yet, though his expenses were enormous, he left behind not merely a\r\nfew myriad denarii, easily reckoned, but a great many. Again, he rebuked\r\nsuch persons as were not chaste, even going to the extent of enacting\r\ncertain laws in regard to adultery, with the result that there were any\r\nnumber of prosecutions for that offence. When consul I once found three\r\nthousand entered on the docket. But inasmuch as very few persons appeared\r\nto conduct their cases, he too ceased to trouble his head about it.\r\nApropos of this, a quite witty remark is reported of the wife of\r\nArgentocoxus, a Caledonian, to Julia Augusta, when the latter after the\r\ntreaty was joking her about the free intercourse of her sex in Britain\r\nwith men. Thereupon the foreigner asserted: \"We fulfill the necessities of\r\nnature in a much better way than you Roman women. We have dealings openly\r\nwith the best men, whereas you let yourselves be debauched in secret by\r\nthe vilest.\" This is what the British woman said.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote:--17--] The following is the style of life that Severus led in\r\ntime of peace. He was sure to be doing something before dawn, while it was\r\nstill night, and after this he would go to walk, telling and hearing of\r\nthe interests of the empire. Then he held court, and separately (unless\r\nthere were some great festival); and indeed, he did this very well. Those\r\non trial were allowed plenty of water [Footnote: The water-clock again.\r\nCompare Book Seventy-one, chapter 6.] and he granted us, his coadjutors,\r\nfull liberty to speak.--He continued to preside till noonday. After that\r\nhe went riding as much as he could. Next he took some kind of exercise and\r\na bath. He then consumed a not meagre lunch, either by himself or with his\r\nchildren. Next, as a rule, he enjoyed a nap. Later he rose, attended to\r\nhis remaining duties of administration, and while walking about occupied\r\nhimself with discussions of both Greek and Latin lore. Then, toward\r\nevening, he would bathe again and dine with his attendants. Very seldom\r\ndid he have any outsider to dinner and only on days when it was quite\r\nunavoidable did he arrange expensive banquets.--He lived sixty-five years,\r\nnine months, and twenty-five days, for he was born on the eleventh of\r\nApril. Of this he had ruled seventeen years, eight months and three days.\r\nIn fine, he showed himself so active that even expiring he gasped: \"Come,\r\ngive it to us, if we have anything to do!\"",
