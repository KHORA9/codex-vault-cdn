It is the guide for the\r\nfuture. The calamities of yesterday are the protectors of to-day.\r\n\r\nThe sea of time we navigate is full of perils. But it is not an\r\nunknown sea. It has been traversed for ages, and there is not a sunken\r\nrock or a treacherous sand-bar which is not marked by the wreck of\r\nthose who have preceded us.\r\n\r\nThere is no portion of history fraught with more valuable instruction\r\nthan the period of those terrible religious wars which desolated the\r\nsixteenth century. There is no romance so wild as the veritable\r\nhistory of those times. The majestic outgoings of the Almighty, as\r\ndeveloped in the onward progress of our race, infinitely transcend, in\r\nall the elements of profoundness, mystery, and grandeur, all that\r\nman's fancy can create.\r\n\r\nThe cartoons of Raphael are beautiful, but what are they when compared\r\nwith the heaving ocean, the clouds of sunset, and the pinnacles of the\r\nAlps? The dome of St. Peter's is man's noblest architecture, but what\r\nis it when compared with the magnificent rotunda of the skies?\r\n\r\n                         JOHN S. C.

Its population, of about five hundred thousand,\r\nconsisted of a very simple, frugal, and industrious people. Those who\r\nlived upon the shore washed by the stormy waves of the Bay of Biscay\r\ngratified their love of excitement and of adventure by braving the\r\nperils of the sea. Those who lived in the solitude of the interior, on\r\nthe sunny slopes of the mountains, or by the streams which meandered\r\nthrough the verdant valleys, fed their flocks, and harvested their\r\ngrain, and pressed rich wine from the grapes of their vineyards, in\r\nthe enjoyment of the most pleasant duties of rural life. Proud of\r\ntheir independence, they were ever ready to grasp arms to repel\r\nforeign aggression. The throne of this kingdom was, at the time of\r\nwhich we speak, occupied by Catharine de Foix. She was a widow, and\r\nall her hopes and affections were centred in her son Henry, an ardent\r\nand impetuous boy six or seven years of age, who was to receive the\r\ncrown when it should fall from her brow, and transmit to posterity\r\ntheir ancestral honors.\r\n\r\nFerdinand of Aragon had just married Isabella of Castile, and had thus\r\nunited those two populous and wealthy kingdoms; and now, in the\r\narrogance of power, seized with the pride of annexation, he began to\r\nlook with a wistful eye upon the picturesque kingdom of Navarre. Its\r\ncomparative feebleness, under the reign of a bereaved woman weary of\r\nthe world, invited to the enterprise. Should he grasp at the whole\r\nterritory of the little realm, France might interpose her powerful\r\nremonstrance. Should he take but the half which was spread out upon\r\nthe southern declivity of the Pyrenees, it would be virtually saying\r\nto the French monarch, \"The rest I courteously leave for you.\" The\r\narmies of Spain were soon sweeping resistlessly through these sunny\r\nvalleys, and one half of her empire was ruthlessly torn from the Queen\r\nof Navarre, and transferred to the dominion of imperious Castile and\r\nAragon.\r\n\r\nCatharine retired with her child to the colder and more uncongenial\r\nregions of the northern declivity of the mountains. Her bosom glowed\r\nwith mortification and rage in view of her hopeless defeat. As she sat\r\ndown gloomily in the small portion which remained to her of her\r\ndismembered empire, she endeavored to foster in the heart of her son\r\nthe spirit of revenge, and to inspire him with the resolution to\r\nregain those lost leagues of territory which had been wrested from the\r\ninheritance of his fathers. Henry imbibed his mother's spirit, and\r\nchafed and fretted under wrongs for which he could obtain no redress.\r\nFerdinand and Isabella could not be annoyed even by any force which\r\nfeeble Navarre could raise. Queen Catharine, however, brooded deeply\r\nover her wrongs, and laid plans for retributions of revenge, the\r\nexecution of which she knew must be deferred till long after her body\r\nshould have mouldered to dust in the grave. She courted the most\r\nintimate alliance with Francis I., King of France. She contemplated\r\nthe merging of her own little kingdom into that powerful monarchy,\r\nthat the infant Navarre, having grown into the giant France, might\r\ncrush the Spanish tyrants into humiliation. Nerved by this determined\r\nspirit of revenge, and inspired by a mother's ambition, she intrigued\r\nto wed her son to the heiress of the French throne, that even in the\r\nworld of spirits she might be cheered by seeing Henry heading the\r\narmies of France, the terrible avenger of her wrongs. These hopes\r\ninvigorated her until the fitful dream of her joyless life was\r\nterminated, and her restless spirit sank into the repose of the grave.\r\nShe lived, however, to see her plans apparently in progress toward\r\ntheir most successful fulfillment.\r\n\r\nHenry, her son, was married to Margaret, the favorite sister of the\r\nKing of France. Their nuptials were blessed with but one child, Jeanne\r\nd'Albret. This child, in whose destiny such ambitious hopes were\r\ncentred, bloomed into most marvelous beauty, and became also as\r\nconspicuous for her mental endowments as for her personal charms. She\r\nhad hardly emerged from the period of childhood when she was married\r\nto Antony of Bourbon, a near relative of the royal family of France.\r\nImmediately after her marriage she left Navarre with her husband, to\r\ntake up her residence in the French metropolis.\r\n\r\nOne hope still lived, with undying vigor, in the bosom of Henry. It\r\nwas the hope, the intense passion, with which his departed mother had\r\ninspired him, that a grandson would arise from this union, who would,\r\nwith the spirit of Hannibal, avenge the family wrongs upon Spain.\r\nTwice Henry took a grandson into his arms with the feeling that the\r\ngreat desire of his life was about to be realized; and twice, with\r\nalmost a broken heart, he saw these hopes blighted as he committed the\r\nlittle ones to the grave.\r\n\r\nSummers and winters had now lingered wearily away, and Henry had\r\nbecome an old man. Disappointment and care had worn down his frame.\r\nWorld-weary and joyless, he still clung to hope. The tidings that\r\nJeanne was again to become a mother rekindled the lustre of his fading\r\neye. The aged king sent importunately for his daughter to return\r\nwithout delay to the paternal castle, that the child might be born in\r\nthe kingdom of Navarre, whose wrongs it was to be his peculiar destiny\r\nto avenge. It was mid-winter. The journey was long and the roads\r\nrough. But the dutiful and energetic Jeanne promptly obeyed the wishes\r\nof her father, and hastened to his court.\r\n\r\nHenry could hardly restrain his impatience as he waited, week after\r\nweek, for the advent of the long-looked-for avenger. With the\r\ncharacteristic superstition of the times, he constrained his daughter\r\nto promise that, at the period of birth, during the most painful\r\nmoments of her trial, she would sing a mirthful and triumphant song,\r\nthat her child might possess a sanguine, joyous, and energetic spirit.\r\n\r\nHenry entertained not a doubt that the child would prove a boy,\r\ncommissioned by Providence as the avenger of Navarre. The old king\r\nreceived the child, at the moment of its birth, into his own arms,\r\ntotally regardless of a mother's rights, and exultingly enveloping it\r\nin soft folds, bore it off, as his own property, to his private\r\napartment. He rubbed the lips of the plump little boy with garlic, and\r\nthen taking a golden goblet of generous wine, the rough and royal\r\nnurse forced the beverage he loved so well down the untainted throat\r\nof his new-born heir.\r\n\r\n\"A little good old wine,\" said the doting grandfather, \"will make the\r\nboy vigorous, and brave.\"\r\n\r\nWe may remark, in passing, that it was _wine_, rich and pure: not that\r\nmixture of all abominations, whose only vintage is in cellars,\r\nsunless, damp, and fetid, where guilty men fabricate poison for a\r\nnation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BIRTH OF HENRY IV.]\r\n\r\nThis little stranger received the ancestral name of Henry. By his\r\nsubsequent exploits he filled the world with his renown. He was the\r\nfirst of the Bourbon line who ascended the throne of France, and he\r\nswayed the sceptre of energetic rule over that wide-spread realm with\r\na degree of power and grandeur which none of his descendants have ever\r\nrivaled. The name of Henry IV. is one of the most illustrious in the\r\nannals of France. The story of his struggles for the attainment of the\r\nthrone of Charlemagne is full of interest. His birth, to which we have\r\njust alluded, occurred at Parr, in the kingdom of Navarre, in the year\r\n1553.\r\n\r\nHis grandfather immediately assumed the direction of every thing\r\nrelating to the child, apparently without the slightest consciousness\r\nthat either the father or the mother of Henry had any prior claims.\r\nThe king possessed, among the wild and romantic fastnesses of the\r\nmountains, a strong old castle, as rugged and frowning as the eternal\r\ngranite upon which its foundations were laid. Gloomy evergreens clung\r\nto the hill-sides. A mountain stream, often swollen to an impetuous\r\ntorrent by the autumnal rains and the spring thaws, swept through the\r\nlittle verdant lawn, which smiled amid the stern sublimities\r\nsurrounding this venerable and moss-covered fortress. Around the\r\nsolitary towers the eagles wheeled and screamed in harmony with the\r\ngales and storms which often swept through these wild regions. The\r\nexpanse around was sparsely settled by a few hardy peasants, who, by\r\nfeeding their herds, and cultivating little patches of soil among the\r\ncrags, obtained a humble living, and by exercise and the pure mountain\r\nair acquired a vigor and an athletic-hardihood of frame which had\r\ngiven them much celebrity.\r\n\r\nTo the storm-battered castle of Courasse, thus lowering in congenial\r\ngloom among these rocks, the old king sent the infant Henry to be\r\nnurtured as a peasant-boy, that, by frugal fare and exposure to\r\nhardship, he might acquire a peasant's robust frame. He resolved that\r\nno French delicacies should enfeeble the constitution of this noble\r\nchild. Bareheaded and barefooted, the young prince, as yet hardly\r\nemerging from infancy, rolled upon the grass, played with the poultry,\r\nand the dogs, and the sturdy young mountaineers, and plunged into the\r\nbrook or paddled in the pools of water with which the mountain showers\r\noften filled the court-yard. His hair was bleached and his cheeks\r\nbronzed by the sun and the wind. Few would have imagined that the\r\nunattractive child, with his unshorn locks and in his studiously\r\nneglected garb, was the descendant of a long line of kings, and was\r\ndestined to eclipse them all by the grandeur of his name.\r\n\r\nAs years glided along he advanced to energetic boyhood, the constant\r\ncompanion, and, in all his sports and modes of life, the equal of the\r\npeasant-boys by whom he was surrounded. He hardly wore a better dress\r\nthan they; he was nourished with the same coarse fare. With them he\r\nclimbed the mountains, and leaped the streams, and swung upon the\r\ntrees. He struggled with his youthful competitors in all their\r\nathletic games, running, wrestling, pitching the quoit, and tossing\r\nthe bar. This active out-door exercise gave a relish to the coarse\r\nfood of the peasants, consisting of brown bread, beef, cheese, and\r\ngarlic. His grandfather had decided that this regimen was essential\r\nfor the education of a prince who was to humble the proud monarchy of\r\nSpain, and regain the territory which had been so unjustly wrested\r\nfrom his ancestors.\r\n\r\nWhen Henry was about six years of age, his grandfather, by gradual\r\ndecay, sank sorrowingly into his grave. Consequently, his mother,\r\nJeanne d'Albret, ascended the throne of Navarre. Her husband, Antony\r\nof Bourbon, was a rough, fearless old soldier, with nothing to\r\ndistinguish him from the multitude who do but live, fight, and die.\r\nJeanne and her husband were in Paris at the time of the death of her\r\nfather. They immediately hastened to Bearn, the capital of Navarre, to\r\ntake possession of the dominions which had thus descended to them. The\r\nlittle Henry was then brought from his wild mountain home to reside\r\nwith his mother in the royal palace. Though Navarre was but a feeble\r\nkingdom, the grandeur of its court was said to have been unsurpassed,\r\nat that time, by that of any other in Europe. The intellectual\r\neducation of Henry had been almost entirely neglected; but the\r\nhardihood of his body had given such vigor and energy to his mind,\r\nthat he was now prepared to distance in intellectual pursuits, with\r\nperfect ease, those whose infantile brains had been overtasked with\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nHenry remained in Bearn with his parents two years, and in that time\r\ningrafted many courtly graces upon the free and fetterless carriage he\r\nhad acquired among the mountains. His mind expanded with remarkable\r\nrapidity, and he became one of the most beautiful and engaging of\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Mary, Queen of Scots, was to be married to the Dauphin\r\nFrancis, son of the King of France. Their nuptials were to be\r\ncelebrated with great magnificence. The King and Queen of Navarre\r\nreturned to the court of France to attend the marriage. They took with\r\nthem their son. His beauty and vivacity excited much admiration in the\r\nFrench metropolis. One day the young prince, then but six or seven\r\nyears of age, came running into the room where his father and Henry\r\nII. of France were conversing, and, by his artlessness and grace,\r\nstrongly attracted the attention of the French monarch. The king\r\nfondly took the playful child in his arms, and said affectionately,\r\n\r\n\"Will you be my son?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sire, no! that is my father,\" replied the ardent boy, pointing to\r\nthe King of Navarre.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, will you be my son-in-law?\" demanded Henry.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, most willingly,\" the prince replied.\r\n\r\nHenry II. had a daughter Marguerite, a year or two younger than the\r\nPrince of Navarre, and it was immediately resolved between the two\r\nparents that the young princes should be considered as betrothed.\r\n\r\nSoon after this the King and Queen of Navarre, with their son,\r\nreturned to the mountainous domain which Jeanne so ardently loved. The\r\nqueen devoted herself assiduously to the education of the young\r\nprince, providing for him the ablest teachers whom that age could\r\nafford. A gentleman of very distinguished attainments, named La\r\nGaucherie, undertook the general superintendence of his studies. The\r\nyoung prince was at this time an exceedingly energetic, active,\r\nambitious boy, very inquisitive respecting all matters of information,\r\nand passionately fond of study.\r\n\r\nDr. Johnson, with his rough and impetuous severity, has said,\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible to get Latin into a boy unless you flog it into\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nThe experience of La Gaucherie, however, did not confirm this\r\nsentiment. Henry always went with alacrity to his Latin and his Greek.\r\nHis judicious teacher did not disgust his mind with long and laborious\r\nrules, but introduced him at once to words and phrases, while\r\ngradually he developed the grammatical structure of the language. The\r\nvigorous mind of Henry, grasping eagerly at intellectual culture,\r\nmade rapid progress, and he was soon able to read and write both Latin\r\nand Greek with fluency, and ever retained the power of quoting, with\r\ngreat facility and appositeness, from the classical writers of Athens\r\nand of Rome. Even in these early days he seized upon the Greek phrase\r\n[Greek: \"_ê nikan ê apothanein_\"], _to conquer or to die_, and adopted\r\nit for his motto.\r\n\r\nLa Gaucherie was warmly attached to the principles of the Protestant\r\nfaith. He made a companion of his noble pupil, and taught him by\r\nconversation in pleasant walks and rides as well as by books. It was\r\nhis practice to have him commit to memory any fine passage in prose or\r\nverse which inculcated generous and lofty ideas. The mind of Henry\r\nthus became filled with beautiful images and noble sentiments from the\r\nclassic writers of France. These gems of literature exerted a powerful\r\ninfluence in moulding his character, and he was fond of quoting them\r\nas the guide of his life. Such passages as the following were\r\nfrequently on the lips of the young prince:\r\n\r\n     \"Over their subjects princes bear the rule,\r\n     But God, more mighty, governs kings themselves.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after the return of the King and Queen of Navarre to their own\r\nkingdom, Henry II. of France died, leaving the crown to his son\r\nCharles, a feeble boy both in body and in mind. As Charles was but ten\r\nor twelve years of age, his mother, Catharine de Medicis, was\r\nappointed regent during his minority. Catharine was a woman of great\r\nstrength of mind, but of the utmost depravity of heart. There was no\r\ncrime ambition could instigate her to commit from which, in the\r\nslightest degree, she would recoil. Perhaps the history of the world\r\nretains not another instance in which a mother could so far forget the\r\nyearnings of nature as to endeavor, studiously and perseveringly, to\r\ndeprave the morals, and by vice to enfeeble the constitution of her\r\nson, that she might retain the power which belonged to him. This proud\r\nand dissolute woman looked with great solicitude upon the enterprising\r\nand energetic spirits of the young Prince of Navarre. There were many\r\nprovidential indications that ere long Henry would be a prominent\r\ncandidate for the throne of France.\r\n\r\nPlutarch's Lives of Ancient Heroes has perhaps been more influential\r\nthan any other uninspired book in invigorating genius and in\r\nenkindling a passion for great achievements. Napoleon was a careful\r\nstudent and a great admirer of Plutarch. His spirit was entranced with\r\nthe grandeur of the Greek and Roman heroes, and they were ever to him\r\nas companions and bosom friends. During the whole of his stormy\r\ncareer, their examples animated him, and his addresses and\r\nproclamations were often invigorated by happy quotations from classic\r\nstory. Henry, with similar exaltation of genius, read and re-read the\r\npages of Plutarch with the most absorbing delight. Catharine, with an\r\neagle eye, watched these indications of a lofty mind. Her solicitude\r\nwas roused lest the young Prince of Navarre should, with his\r\ncommanding genius, supplant her degenerate house.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the sixteenth century, the period of which we write,\r\nall Europe was agitated by the great controversy between the Catholics\r\nand the Protestants. The writings of Luther, Calvin, and other\r\nreformers had aroused the attention of the whole Christian world. In\r\nEngland and Scotland the ancient faith had been overthrown, and the\r\ndoctrines of the Reformation were, in those kingdoms, established. In\r\nFrance, where the writings of Calvin had been extensively circulated,\r\nthe Protestants had also become quite numerous, embracing generally\r\nthe most intelligent portion of the populace. The Protestants were in\r\nFrance called Huguenots, but for what reason is not now known. They\r\nwere sustained by many noble families, and had for their leaders the\r\nPrince of Condé, Admiral Coligni, and the house of Navarre. There were\r\narrayed against them the power of the crown, many of the most powerful\r\nnobles, and conspicuously the almost regal house of Guise.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps difficult for a Protestant to write upon this subject\r\nwith perfect impartiality, however earnestly he may desire to do so.\r\nThe lapse of two hundred years has not terminated the great conflict.\r\nThe surging strife has swept across the ocean, and even now, with more\r\nor less of vehemence, rages in all the states of this new world.\r\nThough the weapons of blood are laid aside, the mighty controversy is\r\nstill undecided.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of the old faith were determined to maintain their\r\ncreed, and to force all to its adoption, at whatever price. They\r\ndeemed heresy the greatest of all crimes, and thought--and doubtless\r\nmany conscientiously thought--that it should be exterminated even by\r\nthe pains of torture and death. The French Parliament adopted for its\r\nmotto, \"_One religion, one law, one king._\" They declared that two\r\nreligions could no more be endured in a kingdom than two governments.\r\n\r\nAt Paris there was a celebrated theological school called the\r\nSorbonne. It included in its faculty the most distinguished doctors of\r\nthe Catholic Church. The decisions and the decrees of the Sorbonne\r\nwere esteemed highly authoritative. The views of the Sorbonne were\r\nalmost invariably asked in reference to any measures affecting the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nIn 1525 the court presented the following question to the Sorbonne:\r\n\"_How can we suppress and extirpate the damnable doctrine of Luther\r\nfrom this very Christian kingdom, and purge it from it entirely?_\"\r\n\r\nThe prompt reply was, \"_The heresy has already been endured too long.\r\nIt must be pursued with the extremest rigor, or it will overthrow the\r\nthrone._\"\r\n\r\nTwo years after this, Pope Clement VII. sent a communication to the\r\nParliament of Paris, stating,\r\n\r\n    \"It is necessary, in this great and astounding disorder,\r\n    which arises from the rage of Satan, and from the fury and\r\n    impiety of his instruments, that every body exert himself to\r\n    guard the common safety, seeing that this madness would not\r\n    only embroil and destroy religion, but also all principality,\r\n    nobility, laws, orders, and ranks.\"\r\n\r\nThe Protestants were pursued by the most unrelenting persecution. The\r\nParliament established a court called the _burning chamber_, because\r\nall who were convicted of heresy were burned. The estates of those\r\nwho, to save their lives, fled from the kingdom, were sold, and their\r\nchildren, who were left behind, were pursued with merciless cruelty.\r\n\r\nThe Protestants, with boldness which religious faith alone could\r\ninspire, braved all these perils. They resolutely declared that the\r\nBible taught their faith, and their faith only, and that no earthly\r\npower could compel them to swerve from the truth. Notwithstanding the\r\nperils of exile, torture, and death, they persisted in preaching what\r\nthey considered the pure Gospel of Christ. In 1533 Calvin was driven\r\nfrom Paris. When one said to him, \"Mass must be true, since it is\r\ncelebrated in all Christendom;\" he replied, pointing to the Bible,\r\n\r\n\"There is my mass.\" Then raising his eyes to heaven, he solemnly said,\r\n\"O Lord, if in the day of judgment thou chargest me with not having\r\nbeen at mass, I will say to thee with truth, 'Lord, thou hast not\r\ncommanded it. Behold thy law. In it I have not found any other\r\nsacrifice than that which was immolated on the altar of the cross.'\"\r\n\r\nIn 1535 Calvin's celebrated \"Institutes of the Christian Religion\"\r\nwere published, the great reformer then residing in the city of Basle.\r\nThis great work became the banner of the Protestants of France. It was\r\nread with avidity in the cottage of the peasant, in the work-shop of\r\nthe artisan, and in the chateau of the noble. In reference to this\r\nextraordinary man, of whom it has been said,\r\n\r\n     \"On Calvin some think Heaven's own mantle fell,\r\n     While others deem him instrument of hell,\"\r\n\r\nTheodore Beza writes, \"I do not believe that his equal can be found.\r\nBesides preaching every day from week to week, very often, and as much\r\nas he was able, he preached twice every Sunday. He lectured on\r\ntheology three times a week. He delivered addresses to the Consistory,\r\nand also instructed at length every Friday before the Bible\r\nConference, which we call the congregation. He continued this course\r\nso constantly that he never failed a single time except in extreme\r\nillness. Moreover, who could recount his other common or extraordinary\r\nlabors? I know of no man of our age who has had more to hear, to\r\nanswer, to write, nor things of greater importance. The number and\r\nquality of his writings alone is enough to astonish any man who sees\r\nthem, and still more those who read them. And what renders his labors\r\nstill more astonishing is, that he had a body so feeble by nature, so\r\ndebilitated by night labors and too great abstemiousness, and, what is\r\nmore, subject to so many maladies, that no man who saw him could\r\nunderstand how he had lived so long. And yet, for all that, he never\r\nceased to labor night and day in the work of the Lord. We entreated\r\nhim to have more regard for himself; but his ordinary reply was that\r\nhe was doing nothing, and that we should allow God to find him always\r\nwatching, and working as he could to his latest breath.\"\r\n\r\nCalvin died in 1564, eleven years after the birth of Henry of Navarre,\r\nat the age of fifty-five. For several years he was so abstemious that\r\nhe had eaten but one meal a day.[A]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: In reference to the execution of Servetus for heresy, an\r\nevent which, in the estimation of many, has seriously tarnished the\r\nreputation of Calvin, the celebrated French historian M. Mignet, in a\r\nvery able dissertation, establishes the following points:\r\n\r\n     1. Servetus was not an ordinary heretic; he was a bold\r\n     pantheist, and outraged the dogma of all Christian\r\n     communions by saying that God, in three persons, was a\r\n     Cerberus, a monster with three heads. 2. He had already been\r\n     condemned to death by the Catholic doctors at Vienne in\r\n     Dauphiny. 3. The affair was judged, not by Calvin, but by\r\n     the magistrates of Geneva; and if it is objected that his\r\n     advice must have influenced their decision, it is necessary\r\n     to recollect that the councils of the other reformed cantons\r\n     of Switzerland approved the sentence with a unanimous voice.\r\n     4. It was of the utmost importance for the Reformation to\r\n     separate distinctly its cause from that of such an\r\n     unbeliever as Servetus. The Catholic Church, which in our\r\n     day accuses Calvin of having participated in his\r\n     condemnation, much more would have accused him, in the\r\n     sixteenth century, with having solicited his acquittal.]\r\n\r\nAt this time the overwhelming majority of the inhabitants of France\r\nwere Catholics--it has generally been estimated a hundred to one; but\r\nthe doctrines of the reformers gained ground until, toward the close\r\nof the century, about the time of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, the\r\nProtestants composed about one sixth of the population.\r\n\r\nThe storm of persecution which fell upon them was so terrible that\r\nthey were compelled to protect themselves by force of arms. Gradually\r\nthey gained the ascendency in several cities, which they fortified,\r\nand where they protected refugees from the persecution which had\r\ndriven them from the cities where the Catholics predominated. Such was\r\nthe deplorable condition of France at the time of which we write.\r\n\r\nIn the little kingdom of Navarre, which was but about one third as\r\nlarge as the State of Massachusetts, and which, since its\r\ndismemberment, contained less than three hundred thousand inhabitants,\r\nnearly every individual was a Protestant. Antony of Bourbon, who had\r\nmarried the queen, was a Frenchman. With him, as with many others in\r\nthat day, religion was merely a badge of party politics. Antony spent\r\nmuch of his time in the voluptuous court of France, and as he was, of\r\ncourse, solicitous for popularity there, he espoused the Catholic side\r\nof the controversy.\r\n\r\nJeanne d'Albret was energetically a Protestant. Apparently, her faith\r\nwas founded in deep religious conviction. When Catharine of Medici\r\nadvised her to follow her husband into the Catholic Church, she\r\nreplied with firmness,\r\n\r\n\"Madam, sooner than ever go to mass, if I had my kingdom and my son\r\nboth in my hands, I would hurl them to the bottom of the sea before\r\nthey should change my purpose.\"\r\n\r\nJeanne had been married to Antony merely as a matter of state policy.\r\nThere was nothing in his character to win a noble woman's love. With\r\nno social or religious sympathies, they lived together for a time in a\r\nstate of respectful indifference; but the court of Navarre was too\r\nquiet and religious to satisfy the taste of the voluptuous Parisian.\r\nHe consequently spent most of his time enjoying the gayeties of the\r\nmetropolis of France. A separation, mutually and amicably agreed upon,\r\nwas the result.\r\n\r\nAntony conveyed with him to Paris his son Henry, and there took up his\r\nresidence. Amidst the changes and the fluctuations of the\r\never-agitated metropolis, he eagerly watched for opportunities to\r\nadvance his own fame and fortune. As Jeanne took leave of her beloved\r\nchild, she embraced him tenderly, and with tears entreated him never\r\nto abandon the faith in which he had been educated.\r\n\r\nJeanne d'Albret, with her little daughter, remained in the less\r\nsplendid but more moral and refined metropolis of her paternal domain.\r\nA mother's solicitude and prayers, however, followed her son. Antony\r\nconsented to retain as a tutor for Henry the wise and learned La\r\nGaucherie, who was himself strongly attached to the reformed religion.\r\n\r\nThe inflexibility of Jeanne d'Albret, and the refuge she ever\r\ncheerfully afforded to the persecuted Protestants, quite enraged the\r\nPope. As a measure of intimidation, he at one time summoned her as a\r\nheretic to appear before the Inquisition within six months, under\r\npenalty of losing her crown and her possessions. Jeanne, unawed by the\r\nthreat, appealed to the monarchs of Europe for protection. None were\r\ndisposed in that age to encourage such arrogant claims, and Pope Pius\r\nVI. was compelled to moderate his haughty tone. A plot, however, was\r\nthen formed to seize her and her children, and hand them over to the\r\n\"tender mercies\" of the Spanish Inquisition. But this plot also\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\nIn Paris itself there were many bold Protestant nobles who, with arms\r\nat their side, and stout retainers around them, kept personal\r\npersecution at bay. They were generally men of commanding character,\r\nof intelligence and integrity. The new religion, throughout the\r\ncountry, was manifestly growing fast in strength, and at times, even\r\nin the saloons of the palace, the rival parties were pretty nearly\r\nbalanced. Although, throughout the kingdom of France, the Catholics\r\nwere vastly more numerous than the Protestants, yet as England and\r\nmuch of Germany had warmly espoused the cause of the reformers, it\r\nwas perhaps difficult to decide which party, on the whole, in Europe,\r\nwas the strongest. Nobles and princes of the highest rank were, in all\r\nparts of Europe, ranged under either banner. In the two factions thus\r\ncontending for dominion, there were, of course, some who were not much\r\ninfluenced by conscientious considerations, but who were merely\r\nstruggling for political power.\r\n\r\nWhen Henry first arrived in Paris, Catharine kept a constant watch\r\nover his words and his actions. She spared no possible efforts to\r\nbring him under her entire control. Efforts were made to lead his\r\nteacher to check his enthusiasm for lofty exploits, and to surrender\r\nhim to the claims of frivolous amusement. This detestable queen\r\npresented before the impassioned young man all the blandishments of\r\nfemale beauty, that she might betray him to licentious indulgence. In\r\nsome of these infamous arts she was but too successful.\r\n\r\nCatharine, in her ambitious projects, was often undecided as to which\r\ncause she should espouse and which party she should call to her aid.\r\nAt one time she would favor the Protestants, and again the Catholics.\r\nAt about this time she suddenly turned to the Protestants, and\r\ncourted them so decidedly as greatly to alarm and exasperate the\r\nCatholics. Some of the Catholic nobles formed a conspiracy, and seized\r\nCatharine and her son at the palace of Fontainebleau, and held them\r\nboth as captives. The proud queen was almost frantic with indignation\r\nat the insult.\r\n\r\nThe Protestants, conscious that the conspiracy was aimed against them,\r\nrallied for the defense of the queen. The Catholics all over the\r\nkingdom sprang to arms. A bloody civil war ensued. Nearly all Europe\r\nwas drawn into the conflict. Germany and England came with eager\r\narmies to the aid of the Protestants. Catharine hated the proud and\r\nhaughty Elizabeth, England's domineering queen, and was very jealous\r\nof her fame and power. She resolved that she would not be indebted to\r\nher ambitious rival for aid. She therefore, most strangely, threw\r\nherself into the arms of the _Catholics_, and ardently espoused their\r\ncause. The Protestants soon found her, with all the energy of her\r\npowerful mind, heading their foes. France was deluged in blood.\r\n\r\nA large number of Protestants threw themselves into Rouen. Antony of\r\nBourbon headed an army of the Catholics to besiege the city. A ball\r\nstruck him, and he fell senseless to the ground. His attendants placed\r\nhim, covered with blood, in a carriage, to convey him to a hospital.\r\nWhile in the carriage and jostling over the rough ground, and as the\r\nthunders of the cannonade were pealing in his ears, the spirit of the\r\nblood-stained soldier ascended to the tribunal of the God of Peace.\r\nHenry was now left fatherless, and subject entirely to the control of\r\nhis mother, whom he most tenderly loved, and whose views, as one of\r\nthe most prominent leaders of the Protestant party, he was strongly\r\ninclined to espouse.\r\n\r\nThe sanguinary conflict still raged with unabated violence throughout\r\nthe whole kingdom, arming brother against brother, friend against\r\nfriend. Churches were sacked and destroyed; vast extents of country\r\nwere almost depopulated; cities were surrendered to pillage, and\r\natrocities innumerable perpetrated, from which it would seem that even\r\nfiends would revolt. France was filled with smouldering ruins; and the\r\nwailing cry of widows and of orphans, thus made by the wrath of man,\r\nascended from every plain and every hill-side to the ear of that God\r\nwho has said, \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\"\r\n\r\nAt last both parties were weary of the horrid strife. The Catholics\r\nwere struggling to extirpate what they deemed ruinous heresy from the\r\nkingdom. The Protestants were repelling the assault, and contending,\r\nnot for general liberty of conscience, but that their doctrines _were\r\ntrue_, and _therefore_ should be sustained. Terms of accommodation\r\nwere proposed, and the Catholics made the great concession, as they\r\nregarded it, of allowing the Protestants to conduct public worship\r\n_outside of the walls of towns_. The Protestants accepted these terms,\r\nand sheathed the sword; but many of the more fanatic Catholics were\r\ngreatly enraged at this toleration. The Guises, the most arrogant\r\nfamily of nobles the world has ever known, retired from Paris in\r\nindignation, declaring that they would not witness such a triumph of\r\nheresy. The decree which granted this poor boon was the famous edict\r\nof January, 1562, issued from St. Germain. But such a peace as this\r\ncould only be a truce caused by exhaustion. Deep-seated animosity\r\nstill rankled in the bosom of both parties; and, notwithstanding all\r\nthe woes which desolating wars had engendered, the spirit of religious\r\nintolerance was eager again to grasp the weapons of deadly strife.\r\n\r\nDuring the sixteenth century the doctrine of religious toleration was\r\nrecognized by no one. That great truth had not then even dawned upon\r\nthe world. The noble toleration so earnestly advocated by Bayle and\r\nLocke a century later, was almost a new revelation to the human mind;\r\nbut in the sixteenth century it would have been regarded as impious,\r\nand rebellion against God to have affirmed that _error_ was not to be\r\npursued and punished. The reformers did not advocate the view that a\r\nman had a right to believe what he pleased, and to disseminate that\r\nbelief. They only declared that they were bound, at all hazards, to\r\nbelieve the _truth;_ that the views which they cherished were _true_,\r\nand that _therefore_ they should be protected in them. They appealed\r\nto the Bible, and challenged their adversaries to meet them there. Our\r\nfathers must not be condemned for not being in advance of the age in\r\nwhich they lived. That toleration which allows a man to adopt, without\r\nany civil disabilities, any mode of worship that does not disturb the\r\npeace of society, exists, as we believe, only in the United States.\r\nEven in England Dissenters are excluded from many privileges.\r\nThroughout the whole of Catholic Europe no religious toleration is\r\nrecognized. The Emperor Napoleon, during his reign, established the\r\nmost perfect freedom of conscience in every government his influence\r\ncould control. His downfall re-established through Europe the dominion\r\nof intolerance.\r\n\r\nThe Reformation, in contending for the right of private judgment in\r\ncontradiction to the claims of councils, maintained a principle which\r\nnecessarily involved the freedom of conscience. This was not then\r\nperceived; but time developed the truth. The Reformation became, in\r\nreality, the mother of all religious liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCIVIL WAR.\r\n\r\n1565-1568\r\n\r\nHenry but little acquainted with his parents.--Indecision of\r\nHenry.--Hypocrisy of Catharine.--She desires to save Henry.--A\r\nsignificant reply.--Indications of future greatness.--The\r\nprophecy.--Visit of Catharine.--Endeavors of Catharine to influence\r\nthe young prince.--The return visit.--Obstacles to the departure.--The\r\nstratagem.--Its success.--Home again.--Description of the\r\nprince.--Evil effects of dissolute society.--Influence of Jeanne\r\nd'Albret.--Catharine's deity.--Principle of Jeanne d'Albret.--The\r\ncannon the missionary.--Devastation.--Indecision of the\r\nprince.--Arguments pro and con.--Chances of a crown.--War\r\nagain.--Arrival of the Queen of Navarre.--Education of the\r\nprince.--The Prince of Condé.--Slaughter of the Protestants.--The\r\nbattle.--Courage of the Prince of Condé.--The defeat.--Death\r\nof the Prince of Condé.--Retreat of the Protestants.--Fiendish\r\nbarbarity.--Advice of the Pope.--Incitement to massacre.--The\r\nprotectorate.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile France was thus deluged with the blood of a civil war, young\r\nHenry was busily pursuing his studies in college. He could have had\r\nbut little affection for his father, for the stern soldier had passed\r\nmost of his days in the tented field, and his son had hardly known\r\nhim. From his mother he had long been separated; but he cherished her\r\nmemory with affectionate regard, and his predilections strongly\r\ninclined him toward the faith which he knew that she had so warmly\r\nespoused. It was, however, in its political aspects that Henry mainly\r\ncontemplated the question. He regarded the two sects merely as two\r\npolitical parties struggling for power. For some time he did not\r\nventure to commit himself openly, but, availing himself of the\r\nprivilege of his youth, carefully studied the principles and the\r\nprospects of the contending factions, patiently waiting for the time\r\nto come in which he should introduce his strong arm into the conflict.\r\nEach party, aware that his parents had espoused opposite sides, and\r\nregarding him as an invaluable accession to either cause, adopted all\r\npossible allurements to win his favor.\r\n\r\nCatharine, as unprincipled as she was ambitious, invited him to her\r\ncourt, lavished upon him, with queenly profusion, caresses and\r\nflattery, and enticed him with all those blandishments which might\r\nmost effectually enthrall the impassioned spirit of youth.\r\nVoluptuousness, gilded with its most dazzling and deceitful\r\nenchantments, was studiously presented to his eye. The queen was all\r\nlove and complaisance. She received him to her cabinet council. She\r\naffected to regard him as her chief confidant. She had already formed\r\nthe design of perfidiously throwing the Protestants off their guard by\r\nprofessions of friendship, and then, by indiscriminate massacre, of\r\nobliterating from the kingdom every vestige of the reformed faith. The\r\ngreat mass of the people being Catholics, she thought that, by a\r\nsimultaneous uprising all over the kingdom, the Protestants might be\r\nso generally destroyed that not enough would be left to cause her any\r\nserious embarrassments.\r\n\r\nFor many reasons Catharine wished to save Henry from the doom\r\nimpending over his friends, if she could, by any means, win him to\r\nher side. She held many interviews with the highest ecclesiastics upon\r\nthe subject of the contemplated massacre. At one time, when she was\r\nurging the expediency of sparing some few Protestant nobles who had\r\nbeen her personal friends, Henry overheard the significant reply from\r\nthe Duke of Alva, \"The head of a salmon is worth a hundred frogs.\" The\r\nyoung prince meditated deeply upon the import of those words.\r\nSurmising their significance, and alarmed for the safety of his\r\nmother, he dispatched a trusty messenger to communicate to her his\r\nsuspicions.\r\n\r\nHis mind was now thoroughly aroused to vigilance, to careful and\r\nhourly scrutiny of the plots and counterplots which were ever forming\r\naround him. While others of his age were absorbed in the pleasures of\r\nlicentiousness and gaming, to which that corrupt court was abandoned,\r\nHenry, though he had not escaped unspotted from the contamination\r\nwhich surrounded him, displayed, by the dignity of his demeanor and\r\nthe elevation of his character, those extraordinary qualities which so\r\nremarkably distinguished him in future life, and which indicated, even\r\nthen, that he was born to command. One of the grandees of the Spanish\r\ncourt, the Duke of Medina, after meeting him incidentally but for a\r\nfew moments, remarked,\r\n\r\n\"It appears to me that this young prince is either an emperor, or is\r\ndestined soon to become one.\"\r\n\r\nHenry was very punctilious in regard to etiquette, and would allow no\r\none to treat him without due respect, or to deprive him of the\r\nposition to which he was entitled by his rank.\r\n\r\nJeanne d'Albret, the Queen of Navarre, was now considered the most\r\nillustrious leader of the Protestant party. Catharine, the better to\r\ndisguise her infamous designs, went with Henry, in great splendor, to\r\nmake a friendly visit to his mother in the little Protestant court of\r\nBearn. Catharine insidiously lavished upon Jeanne d'Albret the warmest\r\ncongratulations and the most winning smiles, and omitted no courtly\r\nblandishments which could disarm the suspicions and win the confidence\r\nof the Protestant queen. The situation of Jeanne in her feeble\r\ndominion was extremely embarrassing. The Pope, in consequence of her\r\nalleged heresy, had issued against her the bull of excommunication,\r\ndeclaring her incapable of reigning, forbidding all good Catholics, by\r\nthe peril of their own salvation, from obeying any of her commands. As\r\nher own subjects were almost all Protestants, she was in no danger of\r\nany insurrection on their part; but this decree, in that age of\r\nsuperstition and of profligacy, invited each neighboring power to\r\nseize upon her territory. The only safety of the queen consisted in\r\nthe mutual jealousies of the rival kingdoms of France and Spain,\r\nneither of them being willing that the other should receive such an\r\naccession to its political importance.\r\n\r\nThe Queen of Navarre was not at all shaken in her faith, or influenced\r\nto change her measure, by the visit of the French court to her\r\ncapital. She regarded, however, with much solicitude, the ascendency\r\nwhich, it appeared to her, Catharine was obtaining over the mind of\r\nher son. Catharine caressed and flattered the young Prince of Navarre\r\nin every possible way. All her blandishments were exerted to obtain a\r\ncommanding influence over his mind. She endeavored unceasingly to lure\r\nhim to indulgence in all forbidden pleasure, and especially to crowd\r\nupon his youthful and ardent passions all the temptations which\r\nyielding female beauty could present. After the visit of a few weeks,\r\nduring which the little court of Navarre had witnessed an importation\r\nof profligacy unknown before, the Queen of France, with Henry and\r\nwith her voluptuous train, returned again to Paris.\r\n\r\nJeanne d'Albret had seen enough of the blandishments of vice to excite\r\nher deepest maternal solicitude in view of the peril of her son. She\r\nearnestly urged his return to Navarre; but Catharine continually threw\r\nsuch chains of influence around him that he could not escape. At last\r\nJeanne resolved, under the pretense of returning the visit of\r\nCatharine, to go herself to the court of France and try to recover\r\nHenry. With a small but illustrious retinue, embellished with great\r\nelegance of manners and purity of life, she arrived in Paris. The\r\nQueen of France received her with every possible mark of respect and\r\naffection, and lavished upon her entertainments, and fêtes, and\r\ngorgeous spectacles until the Queen of Navarre was almost bewildered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FLIGHT OF THE QUEEN OF NAVARRE.]\r\n\r\nWhenever Jeanne proposed to return to her kingdom there was some very\r\nspecial celebration appointed, from which Jeanne could not, without\r\nextreme rudeness, break away. Thus again and again was Jeanne\r\nfrustrated in her endeavors to leave Paris, until she found, to her\r\nsurprise and chagrin, that both she and her son were prisoners,\r\ndetained in captivity by bonds of the most provoking politeness.\r\nCatharine managed so adroitly that Jeanne could not enter any\r\ncomplaints, for the shackles which were thrown around her were those\r\nof ostensibly the most excessive kindness and the most unbounded love.\r\nIt was of no avail to provoke a quarrel, for the Queen of Navarre was\r\npowerless in the heart of France.\r\n\r\nAt last she resolved to effect by stratagem that which she could not\r\naccomplish openly. One day a large party had gone out upon a hunting\r\nexcursion. The Queen of Navarre made arrangements with her son, and a\r\nfew of the most energetic and trustworthy gentlemen of her court, to\r\nseparate themselves, as it were accidentally, when in the eagerness of\r\nthe chase, from the rest of the company, and to meet at an appointed\r\nplace of rendezvous. The little band, thus assembled, turned the heads\r\nof their horses toward Navarre. They drove with the utmost speed day\r\nand night, furnishing themselves with fresh relays of horses, and\r\nrested not till the clatter of the iron hoofs of the steeds were heard\r\namong the mountains of Navarre. Jeanne left a very polite note upon\r\nher table in the palace of St. Cloud, thanking Queen Catharine for all\r\nher kindness, and praying her to excuse the liberty she had taken in\r\navoiding the pain of words of adieu. Catharine was exceedingly\r\nannoyed at their escape, but, perceiving that it was not in her power\r\nto overtake the fugitives, she submitted with as good a grace as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nHenry found himself thus again among his native hills. He was placed\r\nunder the tuition of a gentleman who had a high appreciation of all\r\nthat was poetic and beautiful. Henry, under his guidance, devoted\r\nhimself with great delight to the study of polite literature, and gave\r\nfree wing to an ennobled imagination as he clambered up the cliffs,\r\nand wandered over the ravines familiar to the days of his childhood.\r\nHis personal appearance in 1567, when he was thirteen years of age, is\r\nthus described by a Roman Catholic gentleman who was accustomed to\r\nmeet him daily in the court of Catharine.\r\n\r\n     \"We have here the young Prince of Bearn. One can not help\r\n     acknowledging that he is a beautiful creature. At the age of\r\n     thirteen he displays all the qualities of a person of\r\n     eighteen or nineteen. He is agreeable, he is civil, he is\r\n     obliging. Others might say that as yet he does not know what\r\n     he is; but, for my part, I, who study him very often, can\r\n     assure you that he does know perfectly well. He demeans\r\n     himself toward all the world with so easy a carriage, that\r\n     people crowd round wherever he is; and he acts so nobly in\r\n     every thing, that one sees clearly that he is a great\r\n     prince. He enters into conversation as a highly-polished\r\n     man. He speaks always to the purpose, and it is remarked\r\n     that he is very well informed. I shall hate the reformed\r\n     religion all my life for having carried off from us so\r\n     worthy a person. Without this original sin, he would be the\r\n     first after the king, and we should see him, in a short\r\n     time, at the head of the armies. He gains new friends every\r\n     day. He insinuates himself into all hearts with\r\n     inconceivable skill. He is highly honored by the men, and no\r\n     less beloved by the ladies. His face is very well formed,\r\n     the nose neither too large nor too small. His eyes are very\r\n     soft; his skin brown, but very smooth; and his whole\r\n     features animated with such uncommon vivacity, that, if he\r\n     does not make progress with the fair, it will be very\r\n     extraordinary.\"\r\n\r\nHenry had not escaped the natural influence of the dissolute society\r\nin the midst of which he had been educated, and manifested, on his\r\nfirst return to his mother, a strong passion for balls and\r\nmasquerades, and all the enervating pleasures of fashionable life. His\r\ncourtly and persuasive manners were so insinuating, that, without\r\ndifficulty, he borrowed any sums of money he pleased, and with these\r\nborrowed treasures he fed his passion for excitement at the\r\ngaming-table.\r\n\r\nThe firm principles and high intellectual elevation of his mother\r\nroused her to the immediate and vigorous endeavor to correct all these\r\nradical defects in his character and education. She kept him, as much\r\nas possible, under her own eye. She appointed teachers of the highest\r\nmental and moral attainments to instruct him. By her conversation and\r\nexample she impressed upon his mind the sentiment that it was the most\r\ndistinguished honor of one born to command others to be their superior\r\nin intelligence, judgment, and self-control. The Prince of Navarre, in\r\nhis mother's court at Bearn, found himself surrounded by Protestant\r\nfriends and influences, and he could not but feel and admit the\r\nsuperior dignity and purity of these his new friends.\r\n\r\nCatharine worshiped no deity but ambition. She was ready to adopt any\r\nmeasures and to plunge into any crimes which would give stability and\r\nlustre to her power. She had no religious opinions or even\r\npreferences. She espoused the cause of the Catholics because, on the\r\nwhole, she deemed that party the more powerful; and then she sought\r\nthe entire destruction of the Protestants, that none might be left to\r\ndispute her sway. Had the Protestants been in the majority, she would,\r\nwith equal zeal, have given them the aid of her strong arm, and\r\nunrelentingly would have striven to crush the whole papal power.\r\n\r\nJeanne d'Albret, on the contrary, was in _principle_ a Protestant. She\r\nwas a woman of reflection, of feeling, of highly-cultivated intellect,\r\nand probably of sincere piety. She had read, with deep interest, the\r\nreligious controversies of the day. She had prayed for light and\r\nguidance. She had finally and cordially adopted the Protestant faith\r\nas the truth of God. Thus guided by her sense of duty, she was\r\nexceedingly anxious that her son should be a Protestant--a Protestant\r\nChristian. In most solemn prayer she dedicated him to God's service,\r\nto defend the faith of the Reformers. In the darkness of that day, the\r\nbloody and cruel sword was almost universally recognized as the great\r\nchampion of truth. Both parties appeared to think that the thunders of\r\nartillery and musketry must accompany the persuasive influence of\r\neloquence. If it were deemed important that one hand should guide the\r\npen of controversy, to establish the truth, it was considered no less\r\nimportant that the other should wield the sword to extirpate heresy.\r\nMilitary heroism was thought as essential as scholarship for the\r\ndefense of the faith.\r\n\r\nA truly liberal mind will find its indignation, in view of the\r\natrocities of these religious wars, mitigated by comparison in view of\r\nthe ignorance and the frailty of man. The Protestants often needlessly\r\nexasperated the Catholics by demolishing, in the hour of victory,\r\ntheir churches, their paintings, and their statues, and by pouring\r\ncontempt upon all that was most hallowed in the Catholic heart. There\r\nwas, however, this marked difference between the two parties: the\r\nleaders of the Protestants, as a general rule, did every thing in\r\ntheir power to check the fury of their less enlightened followers. The\r\nleaders of the Catholics, as a general rule, did every thing in their\r\npower to stimulate the fanaticism of the frenzied populace. In the\r\nfirst religious war the Protestant soldiers broke open and plundered\r\nthe great church of Orleans. The Prince of Condé and Admiral Coligni\r\nhastened to repress the disorder. The prince pointed a musket at a\r\nsoldier who had ascended a ladder to break an image, threatening to\r\nshoot him if he did not immediately desist.\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" exclaimed the fanatic Protestant, \"wait till I have thrown\r\ndown this idol, and then, if it please you, I will die.\"\r\n\r\nIt is well for man that Omniscience presides at the day of judgment.\r\n\"The Lord knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.\"\r\n\r\nEurope was manifestly preparing for another dreadful religious\r\nconflict. The foreboding cloud blackened the skies. The young Prince\r\nof Navarre had not yet taken his side. Both Catholics and Protestants\r\nleft no exertions untried to win to their cause so important an\r\nauxiliary. Henry had warm friends in the court of Navarre and in the\r\ncourt of St. Cloud. He was bound by many ties to both Catholics and\r\nProtestants. Love of pleasure, of self-indulgence, of power, urged him\r\nto cast in his lot with the Catholics. Reverence for his mother\r\ninclined him to adopt the weaker party, who were struggling for purity\r\nof morals and of faith. To be popular with his subjects in his own\r\nkingdom of Navarre, he must be a Protestant. To be popular in France,\r\nto whose throne he was already casting a wistful eye, it was necessary\r\nfor him to be a Catholic. He vacillated between these views of\r\nself-interest. His conscience and his heart were untouched. Both\r\nparties were aware of the magnitude of the weight he could place in\r\neither scale, while each deemed it quite uncertain which cause he\r\nwould espouse. His father had died contending for the Catholic faith,\r\nand all knew that the throne of Catholic France was one of the prizes\r\nwhich the young Prince of Navarre had a fair chance of obtaining. His\r\nmother was the most illustrious leader of the Protestant forces on the\r\nContinent, and the crown of Henry's hereditary domain could not repose\r\nquietly upon any brow but that of a Protestant.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of affairs when the clangor of arms again burst\r\nupon the ear of Europe. France was the arena of woe upon which the\r\nCatholics and the Protestants of England and of the Continent hurled\r\nthemselves against each other. Catharine, breathing vengeance, headed\r\nthe Catholic armies. Jeanne, calm yet inflexible, was recognized as at\r\nthe head of the Protestant leaders, and was alike the idol of the\r\ncommon soldiers and of their generals. The two contending armies,\r\nafter various marchings and countermarchings, met at Rochelle. The\r\nwhole country around, for many leagues, was illuminated at night by\r\nthe camp-fires of the hostile hosts. The Protestants, inferior in\r\nnumbers, with hymns and prayers calmly awaited an attack. The\r\nCatholics, divided in council, were fearful of hazarding a decisive\r\nengagement. Day after day thus passed, with occasional skirmishes,\r\nwhen, one sunny morning, the sound of trumpets was heard, and the\r\ngleam of the spears and banners of an approaching host was seen on the\r\ndistant hills. The joyful tidings spread through the ranks of the\r\nProtestants that the Queen of Navarre, with her son and four thousand\r\ntroops, had arrived. At the head of her firm and almost invincible\r\nband she rode, calm and serene, magnificently mounted, with her proud\r\nboy by her side. As the queen and her son entered the plain, an\r\nexultant shout from the whole Protestant host seemed to rend the\r\nskies. These enthusiastic plaudits, loud, long, reiterated, sent\r\ndismay to the hearts of the Catholics.\r\n\r\nJeanne presented her son to the Protestant army, and solemnly\r\ndedicated him to the defense of the Protestant faith. At the same time\r\nshe published a declaration to the world that she deplored the horrors\r\nof war; that she was not contending for the oppression of others, but\r\nto secure for herself and her friends the right to worship God\r\naccording to the teachings of the Bible. The young prince was placed\r\nunder the charge of the most experienced generals, to guard his person\r\nfrom danger and to instruct him in military science. The Prince of\r\nCondé was his teacher in that terrible accomplishment in which both\r\nmaster and pupil have obtained such worldwide renown.\r\n\r\nLong files of English troops, with trumpet tones, and waving banners,\r\nand heavy artillery, were seen winding their way along the streams of\r\nFrance, hastening to the scene of conflict. The heavy battalions of\r\nthe Pope were marshaling upon all the sunny plains of Italy, and the\r\nbanners of the rushing squadrons glittered from the pinnacles of the\r\nAlps, as Europe rose in arms, desolating ten thousand homes with\r\nconflagrations, and blood, and woe. Could the pen record the\r\nsmouldering ruins, the desolate hearthstones, the shrieks of mortal\r\nagony, the wailings of the widow, the cry of the orphan, which thus\r\nresulted from man's inhumanity to man, the heart would sicken at the\r\nrecital. The summer passed away in marches and counter-marches, in\r\nassassinations, and skirmishes, and battles. The fields of the\r\nhusbandmen were trampled under the hoofs of horses. Villages were\r\nburned to the ground, and their wretched inhabitants driven out in\r\nnakedness and starvation to meet the storms of merciless winter. Noble\r\nladies and refined and beautiful maidens fled shrieking from the\r\npursuit of brutal and licentious soldiers. Still neither party gained\r\nany decisive victory. The storms of winter came, and beat heavily,\r\nwith frost and drifting snow, upon the worn and weary hosts.\r\n\r\nIn three months ten thousand Protestants had perished. At Orleans two\r\nhundred Protestants were thrown into prison. The populace set the\r\nprison on fire, and they were all consumed.\r\n\r\nAt length the Catholic armies, having become far more numerous than\r\nthe Protestant, ventured upon a general engagement. They met upon the\r\nfield of Jarnac. The battle was conducted by the Reformers with a\r\ndegree of fearlessness bordering on desperation. The Prince of Condé\r\nplunged into the thickest ranks of the enemy with his unfurled banner\r\nbearing the motto, \"Danger is sweet for Christ and my country.\" Just\r\nas he commenced his desperate charge, a kick from a wounded horse\r\nfractured his leg so severely that the fragments of the bone protruded\r\nthrough his boot. Pointing to the mangled and helpless limb, he said\r\nto those around him, \"Remember the state in which Louis of Bourbon\r\nenters the fight for Christ and his country.\" Immediately sounding the\r\ncharge, like a whirlwind his little band plunged into the midst of\r\ntheir foes. For a moment the shock was irresistible, and the assailed\r\nfell like grass before the scythe of the mower. Soon, however, the\r\nundaunted band was entirely surrounded by their powerful adversaries.\r\nThe Prince of Condé, with but about two hundred and fifty men, with\r\nindomitable determination sustained himself against the serried ranks\r\nof five thousand men closing up around him on every side. This was the\r\nlast earthly conflict of the Prince of Condé. With his leg broken and\r\nhis arm nearly severed from his body, his horse fell dead beneath him,\r\nand the prince, deluged with blood, was precipitated into the dust\r\nunder the trampling hoofs of wounded and frantic chargers. His men\r\nstill fought with desperation around their wounded chieftain. Of\r\ntwenty-five nephews who accompanied him, fifteen were slain by his\r\nside. Soon all his defenders were cut down or dispersed. The wounded\r\nprince, an invaluable prize, was taken prisoner. Montesquieu, captain\r\nof the guards of the Duke of Anjou, came driving up, and as he saw\r\nthe prisoner attracting much attention, besmeared with blood and dirt,\r\n\r\n\"Whom have we here?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\n\"The Prince of Condé,\" was the exultant reply.\r\n\r\n\"Kill him! kill him!\" exclaimed the captain, and he discharged a\r\npistol at his head.\r\n\r\nThe ball passed through his brain, and the prince fell lifeless upon\r\nthe ground. The corpse was left where it fell, and the Catholic troops\r\npursued their foes, now flying in every direction. The Protestants\r\nretreated across a river, blew up the bridge, and protected themselves\r\nfrom farther assault. The next day the Duke of Anjou, the younger\r\nbrother of Charles IX., and who afterward became Henry III., who was\r\none of the leaders of the Catholic army, rode over the field of\r\nbattle, to find, if possible, the body of his illustrious enemy.\r\n\r\n\"We had not rode far,\" says one who accompanied him, \"when we\r\nperceived a great number of the dead bodies piled up in a heap, which\r\nled us to judge that this was the spot where the body of the prince\r\nwas to be found: in fact, we found it there. Baron de Magnac took the\r\ncorpse by the hair to lift up the face, which was turned toward the\r\nground, and asked me if I recognized him; but, as one eye was torn\r\nout, and his face was covered with blood and dirt, I could only reply\r\nthat it was certainly his height and his complexion, but farther I\r\ncould not say.\"\r\n\r\nThey washed the bloody and mangled face, and found that it was indeed\r\nthe prince. His body was carried, with infamous ribaldry, on an ass to\r\nthe castle of Jarnac, and thrown contemptuously upon the ground.\r\nSeveral illustrious prisoners were brought to the spot and butchered\r\nin cold blood, and their corpses thrown upon that of the prince, while\r\nthe soldiers passed a night of drunkenness and revelry, exulting over\r\nthe remains of their dead enemies.\r\n\r\nSuch was the terrible battle of Jarnac, the first conflict which Henry\r\nwitnessed. The tidings of this great victory and of the death of the\r\nillustrious Condé excited transports of joy among the Catholics.\r\nCharles IX. sent to Pope Pius V. the standards taken from the\r\nProtestants. The Pope, who affirmed that Luther was a ravenous beast,\r\nand that his doctrines were the sum of all crimes, wrote to the king\r\na letter of congratulation. He urged him to extirpate every fibre\r\nof heresy, regardless of all entreaty, and of every tie of blood\r\nand affection. To encourage him, he cited the example of Saul\r\nexterminating the Amalekites, and assured him that all tendency to\r\nclemency was a snare of the devil.\r\n\r\nThe Catholics now considered the condition of the Protestants as\r\ndesperate. The pulpits resounded with imprecations and anathemas. The\r\nCatholic priests earnestly advocated the sentiment that no faith was\r\nto be kept with heretics; that to massacre them was an action\r\nessential to the safety of the state, and which would secure the\r\napprobation of God.\r\n\r\nBut the Protestants, though defeated, were still unsubdued. The noble\r\nAdmiral Coligni still remained to them; and after the disaster, Jeanne\r\nd'Albret presented herself before the troops, holding her son Henry,\r\nthen fourteen years of age, by one hand, and Henry, son of the Prince\r\nde Condé, by the other, and devoted them both to the cause. The young\r\nHenry of Navarre was then proclaimed _generalissimo_ of the army and\r\n_protector_ of the churches. He took the following oath: \"I swear to\r\ndefend the Protestant religion, and to persevere in the common cause,\r\ntill death or till victory has secured for all the liberty which we\r\ndesire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE MARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n1568-1572\r\n\r\nEmotions of Henry.--His military sagacity.--Enthusiasm inspired by\r\nJeanne.--The failure of Catharine.--The second defeat.--The wounded\r\nfriends.--The reserve force.--Misfortunes of Coligni.--His\r\nletter.--The third army.--The tide of victory changed.--The treaty\r\nof St. Germaine-en-Laye.--Perfidy of Catharine.--The court at\r\nRochelle.--The two courts.--Marriage of Elizabeth.--The Princess\r\nMarguerite.--Effects of the connection.--A royal match.--Repugnance\r\nof Jeanne d'Albret.--Objections overcome.--Perjury of Charles\r\nIX.--Displays of friendship.--Indifference of Marguerite.--Preparations\r\nfor the wedding.--Death of Jeanne.--Demonstrations of grief.--Different\r\nreports.--The King of Navarre.--Indifference.--Coligni lured to\r\nParis.--He is remonstrated with.--The nuptial day.--The scene.--Small\r\nfavors gratefully received.--Mass.--National festivities.--The\r\ntournament.--Strange representations.--Regal courtesy.--Impediments\r\nto departure.--Mission from the Pope.--The reply.\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung Henry of Navarre was but about fourteen years of age when, from\r\none of the hills in the vicinity, he looked upon the terrible battle\r\nof Jarnac. It is reported that, young as he was, he pointed out the\r\nfatal errors which were committed by the Protestants in all the\r\narrangements which preceded the battle.\r\n\r\n\"It is folly,\" he said, \"to think of fighting, with forces so divided,\r\na united army making an attack at one point.\"\r\n\r\nFor the security of his person, deemed so precious to the Protestants,\r\nhis friends, notwithstanding his entreaties and even tears, would not\r\nallow him to expose himself to any of the perils of the conflict. As\r\nhe stood upon an eminence which overlooked the field of battle,\r\nsurrounded by a few faithful guards, he gazed with intense anguish\r\nupon the sanguinary scene spread out before him. He saw his friends\r\nutterly defeated, and their squadrons trampled in the dust beneath the\r\nhoofs of the Catholic cavalry.\r\n\r\nThe Protestants, without loss of time, rallied anew their forces. The\r\nQueen of Navarre soon saw thousands of strong arms and brave hearts\r\ncollecting again around her banner. Accompanied by her son, she rode\r\nthrough their ranks, and addressed them in words of feminine yet\r\nheroic eloquence, which roused their utmost enthusiasm. But few\r\ninstances have been recorded in which human hearts have been more\r\ndeeply moved than were these martial hosts by the brief sentences\r\nwhich dropped from the lips of this extraordinary woman. Henry, in the\r\nmost solemn manner, pledged himself to consecrate all his energies to\r\nthe defense of the Protestant religion. To each of the chiefs of the\r\narmy the queen also presented a gold medal, suspended from a golden\r\nchain, with her own name and that of her son impressed upon one side,\r\nand on the other the words \"Certain peace, complete victory, or\r\nhonorable death.\" The enthusiasm of the army was raised to the highest\r\npitch, and the heroic queen became the object almost of the adoration\r\nof her soldiers.\r\n\r\nCatharine, seeing the wonderful enthusiasm with which the Protestant\r\ntroops were inspired by the presence of the Queen of Navarre, visited\r\nthe head-quarters of her own army, hoping that she might also\r\nenkindle similar ardor. Accompanied by a magnificent retinue of her\r\nbrilliantly-accoutred generals, she swept, like a gorgeous vision,\r\nbefore her troops. She lavished presents upon her officers, and in\r\nhigh-sounding phrase harangued the soldiers; but there was not a\r\nprivate in the ranks who did not know that she was a wicked and a\r\npolluted woman. She had talent, but no soul. All her efforts were\r\nunavailing to evoke one single electric spark of emotion. She had\r\nsense enough to perceive her signal failure and to feel its\r\nmortification. No one either loved or respected Catharine. Thousands\r\nhated her, yet, conscious of her power, either courting her smiles or\r\ndreading her frown, they often bowed before her in adulation.\r\n\r\nThe two armies were soon facing each other upon the field of battle.\r\nIt was the third of October, 1569. More than fifty thousand combatants\r\nmet upon the plains of Moncontour. All generalship seemed to be\r\nignored as the exasperated adversaries rushed upon each other in a\r\nheadlong fight. The Protestants, outnumbered, were awfully defeated.\r\nOut of twenty-five thousand combatants whom they led into the field,\r\nbut eight thousand could be rallied around their retreating banner\r\nafter a fight of but three quarters of an hour. All their cannon,\r\nbaggage, and munitions of war were lost. No mercy was granted to the\r\nvanquished.\r\n\r\nColigni, at the very commencement of the battle, was struck by a\r\nbullet which shattered his jaw. The gushing blood under his helmet\r\nchoked him, and they bore him upon a litter from the field. As they\r\nwere carrying the wounded admiral along, they overtook another litter\r\nupon which was stretched L'Estrange, the bosom friend of the admiral,\r\nalso desperately wounded. L'Estrange, forgetting himself, gazed for a\r\nmoment with tearful eyes upon the noble Coligni, and then gently said,\r\n\"It is sweet to trust in God.\" Coligni, unable to speak, could only\r\n_look_ a reply. Thus the two wounded friends parted. Coligni afterward\r\nremarked that these few words were a cordial to his spirit, inspiring\r\nhim with resolution and hope.\r\n\r\nHenry of Navarre, and his cousin, Henry of Condé, son of the prince\r\nwho fell at the battle of Jarnac, from a neighboring eminence\r\nwitnessed this scene of defeat and of awful carnage. The admiral,\r\nunwilling to expose to danger lives so precious to their cause, had\r\nstationed them there with a reserve of four thousand men under the\r\ncommand of Louis of Nassau. When Henry saw the Protestants giving way,\r\nhe implored Louis that they should hasten with the reserve to the\r\nprotection of their friends; but Louis, with military rigor, awaited\r\nthe commands of the admiral. \"We lose our advantage, then,\" exclaimed\r\nthe prince, \"and consequently the battle.\"\r\n\r\nThe most awful of earthly calamities seemed now to fall like an\r\navalanche upon Coligni, the noble Huguenot chieftain. His beloved\r\nbrother was slain. Bands of wretches had burned down his castle and\r\nlaid waste his estates. The Parliament of Paris, composed of zealous\r\nCatholics, had declared him guilty of high treason, and offered fifty\r\nthousand crowns to whoever would deliver him up, dead or alive. The\r\nPope declared to all Europe that he was a \"detestable, infamous,\r\nexecrable man, if, indeed, he even merited the name of man.\" His army\r\nwas defeated, his friends cut to pieces, and he himself was grievously\r\nwounded, and was lying upon a couch in great anguish. Under these\r\ncircumstances, thirteen days after receiving his wound, he thus wrote\r\nto his children:\r\n\r\n     \"We should not repose on earthly possessions. Let us place\r\n     our hope beyond the earth, and acquire other treasures than\r\n     those which we see with our eyes and touch with our hands.\r\n     We must follow Jesus our leader, who has gone before us. Men\r\n     have ravished us of what they could. If such is the will of\r\n     God, we shall be happy and our condition good, since we\r\n     endure this loss from no wrong you have done those who have\r\n     brought it to you, but solely for the hate they have borne\r\n     me because God was pleased to direct me to assist his\r\n     Church. For the present, it is enough to admonish and\r\n     conjure you, in the name of God, to persevere courageously\r\n     in the study of virtue.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of a few weeks Coligni rose from his bed, and the\r\nCatholics were amazed to find him at the head of a third army. The\r\nindomitable Queen of Navarre, with the calm energy which ever\r\nsignalized her character, had rallied the fugitives around her, and\r\nhad reanimated their waning courage by her own invincible spirit.\r\nNobles and peasants from all the mountains of Bearn, and from every\r\nprovince in France, thronged to the Protestant camp. Conflict after\r\nconflict ensued. The tide of victory now turned in favor of the\r\nReformers. Henry, absolutely refusing any longer to retire from the\r\nperils of the field, engaged with the utmost coolness, judgment, and\r\nyet impetuosity in all the toils and dangers of the battle. The\r\nProtestant cause gained strength. The Catholics were disheartened.\r\nEven Catharine became convinced that the extermination of the\r\nProtestants by force was no longer possible. So once more they offered\r\nconditions of peace, which were promptly accepted. These terms, which\r\nwere signed at St. Germaine-en-Laye the 8th of August, 1570, were more\r\nfavorable than the preceding. The Protestants were allowed liberty of\r\nworship in all the places then in their possession. They were also\r\nallowed public worship in two towns in each province of the kingdom.\r\nThey were permitted to reside any where without molestation, and were\r\ndeclared _eligible_ to any public office.\r\n\r\nColigni, mourning over the untold evils and miseries of war, with\r\nalacrity accepted these conditions. \"Sooner than fall back into these\r\ndisturbances,\" said he, \"I would choose to die a thousand deaths, and\r\nbe dragged through the streets of Paris.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen, however, and her advisers were guilty of the most extreme\r\nperfidy in this truce. It was merely their object to induce the\r\nforeign troops who had come to the aid of the allies to leave the\r\nkingdom, that they might then exterminate the Protestants by a general\r\nmassacre. Catharine decided to accomplish by the dagger of the\r\nassassin that which she had in vain attempted to accomplish on the\r\nfield of battle. This peace was but the first act in the awful tragedy\r\nof St. Bartholomew.\r\n\r\nPeace being thus apparently restored, the young Prince of Navarre now\r\nreturned to his hereditary domains and visited its various provinces,\r\nwhere he was received with the most lively demonstrations of\r\naffection. Various circumstances, however, indicated to the Protestant\r\nleaders that some mysterious and treacherous plot was forming for\r\ntheir destruction. The Protestant gentlemen absented themselves,\r\nconsequently, from the court of Charles IX. The king and his mother\r\nwere mortified by these evidences that their perfidy was suspected.\r\n\r\nJeanne, with her son, after visiting her subjects in all parts of her\r\nown dominions, went to Rochelle, where they were joined by many of the\r\nmost illustrious of their friends. Large numbers gathered around them,\r\nand the court of the Queen of Navarre was virtually transferred to\r\nthat place. Thus there were two rival courts, side by side, in the\r\nsame kingdom. Catharine, with her courtiers, exhibited boundless\r\nluxury and voluptuousness at Paris. Jeanne d'Albret, at Rochelle,\r\nembellished her court with all that was noble in intellect, elegant in\r\nmanners, and pure in morals. Catharine and her submissive son Charles\r\nIX. left nothing untried to lure the Protestants into a false\r\nsecurity. Jeanne scrupulously requited the courtesies she received\r\nfrom Catharine, though she regarded with much suspicion the adulation\r\nand the sycophancy of her proud hostess.\r\n\r\nThe young King of France, Charles IX., who was of about the same age\r\nwith Henry, and who had been his companion and playmate in childhood,\r\nwas now married to Elizabeth, the daughter of the Emperor Maximilian\r\nII. of Austria. Their nuptials were celebrated with all the\r\nostentatious pomp which the luxury of the times and the opulence of\r\nthe French monarchy could furnish. In these rejoicings the courts of\r\nFrance and Navarre participated with the semblance of the most\r\nheartfelt cordiality. Protestants and Catholics, pretending to forget\r\nthat they had recently encountered each other with fiendlike fury in\r\nfields of blood, mingled gayly in these festivities, and vied with\r\neach other in the exchange of courtly greetings and polished\r\nflatteries. Catharine and Charles IX. lavished, with the utmost\r\nprofusion, their commendations and attentions upon the young Prince of\r\nNavarre, and left no arts of dissimulation unessayed which might\r\ndisarm the fears and win the confidence of their victims.\r\n\r\nThe queen mother, with caressing fondness, declared that Henry must be\r\nher son. She would confer upon him Marguerite, her youngest daughter.\r\nThis princess had now become a young lady, beautiful in the extreme,\r\nand highly accomplished in all those graces which can kindle the fires\r\nand feed the flames of passion; but she was also as devoid of\r\nprinciple as any male libertine who contaminated by his presence a\r\ncourt whose very atmosphere was corruption. Many persons of royal\r\nblood had most earnestly sought the hand of this princess, for an\r\nalliance with the royal family of France was an honor which the\r\nproudest sovereigns might covet. Such a connection, in its political\r\naspects, was every thing Henry could desire. It would vastly augment\r\nthe consideration and the power of the young prince, and would bring\r\nhim a long step nearer to the throne of France. The Protestants were\r\nall intensely interested in this match, as it would invest one,\r\ndestined soon to become their most prominent leader, with new ability\r\nto defend their rights and to advocate their cause. It is a singular\r\nillustration of the hopeless corruption of the times, that the\r\nnotorious profligacy of Marguerite seems to have been considered, even\r\nby Henry himself, as no obstacle to the union.\r\n\r\nA royal marriage is ordinarily but a matter of state policy. Upon the\r\ncold and icy eminence of kingly life the flowers of sympathy and\r\naffection rarely bloom. Henry, without hesitation, acquiesced in the\r\nexpediency of this nuptial alliance. He regarded it as manifestly a\r\nvery politic partnership, and did not concern himself in the least\r\nabout the agreeable or disagreeable qualities of his contemplated\r\nspouse. He had no idea of making her his companion, much less his\r\nfriend. She was to be merely his _wife_.\r\n\r\nJeanne d'Albret, however, a woman of sincere piety, and in whose bosom\r\nall noble thoughts were nurtured, cherished many misgivings. Her\r\nProtestant principles caused her to shrink from the espousals of her\r\nson with a Roman Catholic. Her religious scruples, and the spotless\r\npurity of her character, aroused the most lively emotions of\r\nrepugnance in view of her son's connection with one who had not even\r\nthe modesty to conceal her vices. State considerations, however,\r\nfinally prevailed, and Jeanne, waiving her objections, consented to\r\nthe marriage. She yielded, however, with the greatest reluctance, to\r\nthe unceasing importunities of her friends. They urged that this\r\nmarriage would unite the two parties in a solid peace, and thus\r\nprotect the Protestants from persecution, and rescue France from\r\nunutterable woe. Even the Admiral Coligni was deceived. But the result\r\nproved, in this case as in every other, that _it is never safe to do\r\nevil that good may come_. If any fact is established under the\r\ngovernment of God, it is this.\r\n\r\nThe Queen of Navarre, in her extreme repugnance to this match,\r\nremarked,\r\n\r\n\"I would choose to descend to the condition of the poorest damsel in\r\nFrance rather than sacrifice to the grandeur of my family my own soul\r\nand that of my son.\"\r\n\r\nWith consummate perjury, Charles IX. declared, \"I give my sister in\r\nmarriage, not only to the Prince of Navarre, but, as it were, to the\r\nwhole Protestant party. This will be the strongest and closest bond\r\nfor the maintenance of peace between my subjects, and a sure evidence\r\nof my good-will toward the Protestants.\"\r\n\r\nThus influenced, this noble woman consented to the union. She then\r\nwent to Blois to meet Catharine and the king. They received her with\r\nexuberant displays of love. The foolish king quite overacted his part,\r\ncalling her \"his great aunt, his all, his best beloved.\" As the Queen\r\nof Navarre retired for the night, Charles said to Catharine, laughing,\r\n\r\n\"Well, mother, what do you think of it? Do I play my little part\r\nwell?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Catharine, encouragingly, \"very well; but it is of no use\r\nunless it continues.\"\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to go on,\" said the king, \"and you will see that I shall\r\nensnare them.\"\r\n\r\nThe young Princess Marguerite, heartless, proud, and petulant,\r\nreceived the cold addresses of Henry with still more chilling\r\nindifference. She refused to make even the slightest concessions to\r\nhis religious views, and, though she made no objection to the\r\ndecidedly politic partnership, she very ostentatiously displayed her\r\nutter disregard for Henry and his friends. The haughty and dissolute\r\nbeauty was piqued by the reluctance which Jeanne had manifested to an\r\nalliance which Marguerite thought should have been regarded as the\r\nvery highest of all earthly honors. Preparations were, however, made\r\nfor the marriage ceremony, which was to be performed in the French\r\ncapital with unexampled splendor. The most distinguished gentlemen of\r\nthe Protestant party, nobles, statesmen, warriors, from all parts of\r\nthe realm, were invited to the metropolis, to add lustre to the\r\nfestivities by their presence. Many, however, of the wisest counselors\r\nof the Queen of Navarre, deeply impressed with the conviction of the\r\nutter perfidy of Catharine, and apprehending some deep-laid plot,\r\nremonstrated against the acceptance of the invitations, presaging\r\nthat, \"if the wedding were celebrated in Paris, the liveries would be\r\nvery crimson.\"\r\n\r\nJeanne, solicited by the most pressing letters from Catharine and her\r\nson Charles IX., and urged by her courtiers, who were eager to share\r\nthe renowned pleasures of the French metropolis, proceeded to Paris.\r\nShe had hardly entered the sumptuous lodgings provided for her in the\r\ncourt of Catharine, when she was seized with a violent fever, which\r\nraged in her veins nine days, and then she died. In death she\r\nmanifested the same faith and fortitude which had embellished her\r\nlife. Not a murmur or a groan escaped her lips in the most violent\r\nparoxysms of pain. She had no desire to live except from maternal\r\nsolicitude for her children, Henry and Catharine.\r\n\r\n\"But God,\" said she, \"will be their father and protector, as he has\r\nbeen mine in my greatest afflictions. I confide them to his\r\nprovidence.\"\r\n\r\nShe died in June, 1572, in the forty-fourth year of her age. Catharine\r\nexhibited the most ostentatious and extravagant demonstrations of\r\ngrief. Charles gave utterance to loud and poignant lamentations, and\r\nordered a surgeon to examine the body, that the cause of her death\r\nmight be ascertained. Notwithstanding these efforts to allay\r\nsuspicion, the report spread like wildfire through all the departments\r\nof France, and all the Protestant countries of Europe, that the queen\r\nhad been perfidiously poisoned by Catharine. The Protestant writers of\r\nthe time assert that she fell a victim to poison communicated by a\r\npair of perfumed gloves. The Catholics as confidently affirm that she\r\ndied of a natural disease. The truth can now never be known till the\r\nsecrets of all hearts shall be revealed at the judgment day.\r\n\r\nHenry, with his retinue, was slowly traveling toward Paris,\r\nunconscious of his mother's sickness, when the unexpected tidings\r\narrived of her death. It is difficult to imagine what must have been\r\nthe precise nature of the emotions of an ambitious young man in such\r\nan event, who ardently loved both his mother and the crown which she\r\nwore, as by the loss of the one he gained the other. The cloud of his\r\ngrief was embellished with the gilded edgings of joy. The Prince of\r\nBearn now assumed the title and the style of the King of Navarre, and\r\nhonored the memory of his noble mother with every manifestation of\r\nregret and veneration. This melancholy event caused the postponement\r\nof the marriage ceremony for a short time, as it was not deemed\r\ndecorous that epithalamiums should be shouted and requiems chanted\r\nfrom the same lips in the same hour. The knell tolling the burial of\r\nthe dead would not blend harmoniously with the joyous peals of the\r\nmarriage bell. Henry was not at all annoyed by this delay, for no\r\nimpatient ardor urged him to his nuptials. Marguerite, annoyed by the\r\nopposition which Henry's mother had expressed in regard to the\r\nalliance, and vexed by the utter indifference which her betrothed\r\nmanifested toward her person, indulged in all the wayward humors of a\r\nworse than spoiled child. She studiously displayed her utter disregard\r\nfor Henry, which manifestations, with the most provoking\r\nindifference, he did not seem even to notice.\r\n\r\nDuring this short interval the Protestant nobles continued to flock to\r\nParis, that they might honor with their presence the marriage of the\r\nyoung chief. The Admiral Coligni was, by very special exertions on the\r\npart of Catharine and Charles, lured to the metropolis. He had\r\nreceived anonymous letters warning him of his danger. Many of his more\r\nprudent friends openly remonstrated against his placing himself in the\r\npower of the perfidious queen. Coligni, however, was strongly attached\r\nto Henry, and, in defiance of all these warnings, he resolved to\r\nattend his nuptials. \"I confide,\" said he, \"in the sacred word of his\r\nmajesty.\"\r\n\r\nUpon his arrival in the metropolis, Catharine and Charles lavished\r\nupon him the most unbounded manifestations of regard. The king,\r\nembracing the admiral, exclaimed, \"This is the happiest day of my\r\nlife.\" Very soon one of the admiral's friends called upon him to take\r\nleave, saying that he was immediately about to retire into the\r\ncountry. When asked by the admiral the cause of his unexpected\r\ndeparture, he replied, \"I go because they caress you too much, and I\r\nwould rather save myself with fools than perish with sages.\"\r\n\r\nAt length the nuptial day arrived. It was the seventeenth of August,\r\n1572. Paris had laid aside its mourning weeds, and a gay and brilliant\r\ncarnival succeeded its dismal days of gloom. Protestants and\r\nCatholics, of highest name and note, from every part of Europe, who\r\nhad met in the dreadful encounters of a hundred fields of blood, now\r\nmingled in apparent fraternity with the glittering throng, all\r\ninterchanging smiles and congratulations. The unimpassioned bridegroom\r\nled his scornful bride to the church of Notre Dame. Before the massive\r\nportals of this renowned edifice, and under the shadow of its\r\nvenerable towers, a magnificent platform had been reared, canopied\r\nwith the most gorgeous tapestry. Hundreds of thousands thronged the\r\nsurrounding amphitheatre, swarming at the windows, crowding the\r\nbalconies, and clustered upon the house-tops, to witness the imposing\r\nceremony. The gentle breeze breathing over the multitude was laden\r\nwith the perfume of flowers. Banners, and pennants, and ribbons of\r\nevery varied hue waved in the air, or hung in gay festoons from window\r\nto window, and from roof to roof. Upon that conspicuous platform, in\r\nthe presence of all the highest nobility of France, and of the most\r\nillustrious representatives of every court of Europe, Henry received\r\nthe hand of the haughty princess, and the nuptial oath was\r\nadministered.\r\n\r\nMarguerite, however, even in that hour, and in the presence of all\r\nthose spectators, gave a ludicrous exhibition of her girlish petulance\r\nand ungoverned willfulness. When, in the progress of the ceremony, she\r\nwas asked if she willingly received Henry of Bourbon for her husband,\r\nshe pouted, coquettishly tossed her proud head, and was silent. The\r\nquestion was repeated. The spirit of Marguerite was now roused, and\r\nall the powers of Europe could not tame the shrew. She fixed her eyes\r\ndefiantly upon the officiating bishop, and refusing, by look, or word,\r\nor gesture, to express the slightest assent, remained as immovable as\r\na statue. Embarrassment and delay ensued. Her royal brother, Charles\r\nIX., fully aware of his sister's indomitable resolution, coolly walked\r\nup to the termagant at bay, and placing one hand upon her chest and\r\nthe other upon the back of her head, compelled an involuntary nod. The\r\nbishop smiled and bowed, and acting upon the principle that small\r\nfavors were gratefully received, proceeded with the ceremony. Such\r\nwere the vows with which Henry and Marguerite were united. Such is too\r\noften _love in the palace_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MARRIAGE.]\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholic wife, unaccompanied by her Protestant husband, who\r\nwaited at the door with his retinue, now entered the church of Notre\r\nDame to participate in the solemnities of the mass. The young King of\r\nNavarre then submissively received his bride and conducted her to a\r\nvery magnificent dinner. Catharine and Charles IX., at this\r\nentertainment, were very specially attentive to the Protestant nobles.\r\nThe weak and despicable king leaned affectionately upon the arm of the\r\nAdmiral Coligni, and for a long time conversed with him with every\r\nappearance of friendship and esteem. Balls, illuminations, and\r\npageants ensued in the evening. For many days these unnatural and\r\nchilling nuptials were celebrated with all the splendor of national\r\nfestivities. Among these entertainments there was a tournament,\r\nsingularly characteristic of the times, and which certainly sheds\r\npeculiar lustre either upon the humility or upon the good-nature of\r\nthe Protestants.\r\n\r\nA large area was prepared for the display of one of those barbaric\r\npasses of arms in which the rude chivalry of that day delighted. The\r\ninclosure was surrounded by all the polished intellect, rank, and\r\nbeauty of France. Charles IX., with his two brothers and several of\r\nthe Catholic nobility, then appeared upon one side of the arena on\r\nnoble war-horses gorgeously caparisoned, and threw down the gauntlet\r\nof defiance to Henry of Navarre and his Protestant retinue, who,\r\nsimilarly mounted and accoutred, awaited the challenge upon the\r\nopposite side.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the inclosure in which the Catholics appeared was\r\ndecorated to represent heaven. Birds of Paradise displayed their\r\ngorgeous plumage, and the air was vocal with the melody of trilling\r\nsongsters. Beauty displayed its charms arrayed in celestial robes, and\r\nambrosial odors lulled the senses in luxurious indulgence. All the\r\nresources of wealth and art were lavished to create a vision of the\r\nhome of the blessed.\r\n\r\nThe Protestants, in the opposite extreme of the arena, were seen\r\nemerging from the desolation, the gloom, and the sulphurous canopy of\r\nhell. The two parties, from their antagonistic realms, rushed to the\r\nencounter, the fiends of darkness battling with the angels of light.\r\nGradually the Catholics, in accordance with previous arrangements,\r\ndrove back the Protestants toward their grim abodes, when suddenly\r\nnumerous demons appeared rushing from the dungeons of the infernal\r\nregions, who, with cloven hoofs, and satanic weapons, and chains\r\nforged in penal fires, seized upon the Protestants and dragged them to\r\nthe blackness of darkness from whence they had emerged. Plaudits loud\r\nand long greeted this discomfiture of the Protestants by the infernal\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly the scene is changed. A winged Cupid appears, the\r\nrepresentative of the pious and amiable bride Marguerite. The demons\r\nfly in dismay before the irresistible boy. Fearlessly this emissary of\r\nlove penetrates the realms of despair. The Protestants, by this\r\nagency, are liberated from their thralldom, and conducted in triumph\r\nto the Elysium of the Catholics. A more curious display of regal\r\ncourtesy history has not recorded. And this was in Paris!\r\n\r\nImmediately after the marriage, the Admiral Coligni was anxious to\r\nobtain permission to leave the city. His devout spirit found no\r\nenjoyment in the gayeties of the metropolis, and he was deeply\r\ndisgusted with the unveiled licentiousness which he witnessed every\r\nwhere around him. Day after day, however, impediments were placed in\r\nthe way of his departure, and it was not until three days after the\r\nmarriage festivities that he succeeded in obtaining an audience with\r\nCharles. He accompanied Charles to the racket-court, where the young\r\nmonarch was accustomed to spend much of his time, and there bidding\r\nhim adieu, left him to his amusements, and took his way on foot toward\r\nhis lodgings.\r\n\r\nThe Pope, not aware of the treachery which was contemplated, was much\r\ndispleased in view of the apparently friendly relations which had thus\r\nsuddenly sprung up between the Catholics and the Protestants. He was\r\nexceedingly perplexed by the marriage, and at last sent a legate to\r\nexpostulate with the French king. Charles IX. was exceedingly\r\nembarrassed how to frame a reply. He wished to convince the legate of\r\nhis entire devotion to the Papal Church, and, at the same time, he did\r\nnot dare to betray his intentions; for the detection of the conspiracy\r\nwould not only frustrate all his plans, but would load him with\r\nignominy, and vastly augment the power of his enemies.\r\n\r\n\"I do devoutly wish,\" Charles replied, \"that I could tell you all; but\r\nyou and the Pope shall soon know how beneficial this marriage shall\r\nprove to the interests of religion. Take my word for it, in a little\r\ntime the holy father shall have reason to praise my designs, my piety,\r\nand my zeal in behalf of the faith.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR MASSACRE.\r\n\r\n1572\r\n\r\nThe attempted assassination of Coligni.--Escape of the\r\nassassin.--Arrival of Henry.--Christian submission of\r\nColigni.--Indignation of Henry.--Artifice of Catharine and\r\nCharles.--Perplexity of the Protestants.--Secret preparations.--Feeble\r\ncondition of the Protestants.--The visit.--The secret\r\ncouncil.--Preparations to arm the citizens.--Directions for the\r\nmassacre.--Signals.--Feast at the Louvre.--Embarrassment of\r\nHenry.--The Duke of Lorraine.--His hatred toward the Protestants.--The\r\nassassin's revenge.--Anxiety of the Duchess of Lorraine.--Scene in\r\nHenry's chamber.--Rumors of trouble.--Assembling for work.--Alarm\r\nin the metropolis.--Inflexibility of Catharine.--The faltering of\r\nCharles.--Nerved for the work.--The knell of death.--\"Vive Dieu et\r\nle roi!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Admiral Coligni was quietly passing through the streets from\r\nhis interview with Charles at the Louvre to his residence, in\r\npreparation for his departure, accompanied by twelve or fifteen of his\r\npersonal friends, a letter was placed in his hands. He opened it, and\r\nbegan to read as he walked slowly along. Just as he was turning a\r\ncorner of the street, a musket was discharged from the window of an\r\nadjoining house, and two balls struck him. One cut off a finger of his\r\nright hand, and the other entered his left arm. The admiral, inured to\r\nscenes of danger, manifested not the slightest agitation or alarm. He\r\ncalmly pointed out to his friends the house from which the gun had\r\nbeen discharged, and his attendants rushed forward and broke open the\r\ndoor. The assassin, however, escaped through a back window, and,\r\nmounting a fleet horse stationed there, and which was subsequently\r\nproved to have belonged to a nephew of the king, avoided arrest. It\r\nwas clearly proved in the investigations which immediately ensued\r\nthat the assassin was in connivance with some of the most prominent\r\nCatholics of the realm. The Duke of Guise and Catharine were clearly\r\nimplicated.\r\n\r\nMessengers were immediately dispatched to inform the king of the crime\r\nwhich had been perpetrated. Charles was still playing in the\r\ntennis-court. Casting away his racket, he exclaimed, with every\r\nappearance of indignation, \"Shall I never be at peace?\"\r\n\r\nThe wounded admiral was conveyed to his lodgings. The surgeons of the\r\ncourt, the ministers of the Protestant Church, and the most\r\nillustrious princes and nobles of the admiral's party hastened to the\r\ncouch of the sufferer. Henry of Navarre was one of the first that\r\narrived, and he was deeply moved as he bent over his revered and\r\nmuch-loved friend. The intrepid and noble old man seemed perfectly\r\ncalm and composed, reposing unfailing trust in God.\r\n\r\n\"My friends,\" said he, \"why do you weep? For myself, I deem it an\r\nhonor to have received these wounds for the name of God. Pray him to\r\nstrengthen me.\"\r\n\r\nHenry proceeded from the bedside of the admiral to the Louvre. He\r\nfound Charles and Catharine there, surrounded by many of the nobles\r\nof their court. In indignant terms Henry reproached both mother and\r\nson with the atrocity of the crime which had been committed, and\r\ndemanded immediate permission to retire from Paris, asserting that\r\nneither he nor his friends could any longer remain in the capital in\r\nsafety. The king and his mother vied with each other in noisy,\r\nvoluble, and even blasphemous declarations of their utter abhorrence\r\nof the deed; but all the oaths of Charles and all the vociferations of\r\nCatharine did but strengthen the conviction of the Protestants that\r\nthey both were implicated in this plot of assassination. Catharine and\r\nCharles, feigning the deepest interest in the fate of their wounded\r\nguest, hastened to his sick-chamber with every possible assurance of\r\ntheir distress and sympathy. Charles expressed the utmost indignation\r\nat the murderous attempt, and declared, with those oaths which are\r\ncommon to vulgar minds, that he would take the most terrible vengeance\r\nupon the perpetrators as soon as he could discover them.\r\n\r\n\"To discover them can not be difficult,\" coolly replied the admiral.\r\n\r\nHenry of Navarre, overwhelmed with indignation and sorrow, was\r\ngreatly alarmed in view of the toils in which he found himself and his\r\nfriends hopelessly involved. The Protestants, who had been thus lured\r\nto Paris, unarmed and helpless, were panic-stricken by these\r\nindications of relentless perfidy. They immediately made preparations\r\nto escape from the city. Henry, bewildered by rumors of plots and\r\nperils, hesitated whether to retire from the capital with his friends\r\nin a body, taking the admiral with them, or more secretly to endeavor\r\nto effect an escape.\r\n\r\nBut Catharine and Charles, the moment for action having not quite\r\narrived, were unwearied in their exertions to allay this excitement\r\nand soothe these alarms. They became renewedly clamorous in their\r\nexpressions of grief and indignation in view of the assault upon the\r\nadmiral. The king placed a strong guard around the house where the\r\nwounded nobleman lay, ostensibly for the purpose of protecting him\r\nfrom any popular outbreak, but in reality, as it subsequently\r\nappeared, to guard against his escape through the intervention of his\r\nfriends. He also, with consummate perfidy, urged the Protestants in\r\nthe city to occupy quarters near together, that, in case of trouble,\r\nthey might more easily be protected by him, and might more\r\neffectually aid one another. His real object, however, was to assemble\r\nthem in more convenient proximity for the slaughter to which they were\r\ndoomed. The Protestants were in the deepest perplexity. They were not\r\nsure but that all their apprehensions were groundless; and yet they\r\nknew not but that in the next hour some fearful battery would be\r\nunmasked for their destruction. They were unarmed, unorganized, and\r\nunable to make any preparation to meet an unknown danger. Catharine,\r\nwhose depraved yet imperious spirit was guiding with such consummate\r\nduplicity all this enginery of intrigue, hourly administered the\r\nstimulus of her own stern will to sustain the faltering purpose of her\r\nequally depraved but fickle-minded and imbecile son.\r\n\r\nSome circumstances seem to indicate that Charles was not an accomplice\r\nwith his mother in the attempt upon the life of the admiral. She said\r\nto her son, \"Notwithstanding all your protestations, the deed will\r\ncertainly be laid to your charge. Civil war will again be enkindled.\r\nThe chiefs of the Protestants are now all in Paris. You had better\r\ngain the victory at once here than incur the hazard of a new\r\ncampaign.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" said Charles, petulantly, \"since you approve the murder\r\nof the admiral, I am content. But let all the Huguenots also fall,\r\nthat there may not be one left to reproach me.\"\r\n\r\nIt was on Friday, the 22d of August, that the bullets of the assassin\r\nwounded Coligni. The next day Henry called again, with his bride, to\r\nvisit his friend, whose finger had been amputated, and who was\r\nsuffering extreme pain from the wound in his arm. Marguerite had but\r\nfew sympathies with the scenes which are to be witnessed in the\r\nchamber of sickness. She did not conceal her impatience, but, after a\r\nfew commonplace phrases of condolence with her husband's bosom friend,\r\nshe hastened away, leaving Henry to perform alone the offices of\r\nfriendly sympathy.\r\n\r\nWhile the young King of Navarre was thus sitting at the bedside of the\r\nadmiral, recounting to him the assurances of faith and honor given by\r\nCatharine and her son, the question was then under discussion, in\r\nsecret council, at the palace, by this very Catharine and Charles,\r\nwhether Henry, the husband of the daughter of the one and of the\r\nsister of the other, should be included with the rest of the\r\nProtestants in the massacre which they were plotting. Charles\r\nmanifested some reluctance thus treacherously to take the life of his\r\nearly playmate and friend, his brother-in-law, and his invited guest.\r\nIt was, after much deliberation, decided to protect him from the\r\ngeneral slaughter to which his friends were destined.\r\n\r\nThe king sent for some of the leading officers of his troops, and\r\ncommanded them immediately, but secretly, to send his agents through\r\nevery section of the city, to arm the Roman Catholic citizens, and\r\nassemble them, at midnight, in front of the Hotel de Ville.\r\n\r\nThe energetic Duke of Guise, who had acquired much notoriety by the\r\nsanguinary spirit with which he had persecuted the Protestants, was to\r\ntake the lead of the carnage. To prevent mistakes in the confusion of\r\nthe night, he had issued secret orders for all the Catholics \"to wear\r\na white cross on the hat, and to bind a piece of white cloth around\r\nthe arm.\" In the darkest hour of the night, when all the sentinels of\r\nvigilance and all the powers of resistance should be most effectually\r\ndisarmed by sleep, the alarm-bell, from the tower of the Palace of\r\nJustice, was to toll the signal for the indiscriminate massacre of the\r\nProtestants. The bullet and the dagger were to be every where\r\nemployed, and men, women, and children were to be cut down without\r\nmercy. With a very few individual exceptions, none were to be left to\r\navenge the deed. Large bodies of troops, who hated the Protestants\r\nwith that implacable bitterness which the most sanguinary wars of many\r\nyears had engendered, had been called into the city, and they,\r\nfamiliar with deeds of blood, were to commence the slaughter. All good\r\ncitizens were enjoined, as they loved their Savior, to aid in the\r\nextermination of the enemies of the Church of Rome. Thus, it was\r\ndeclared, God would be glorified and the best interests of man\r\npromoted. The spirit of the age was in harmony with the act, and it\r\ncan not be doubted that there were those who had been so instructed by\r\ntheir spiritual guides that they truly believed that by this sacrifice\r\nthey were doing God service.\r\n\r\nThe conspiracy extended throughout all the provinces of France. The\r\nstorm was to burst, at the same moment, upon the unsuspecting victims\r\nin every city and village of the kingdom. Beacon-fires, with their\r\nlurid midnight glare, were to flash the tidings from mountain to\r\nmountain. The peal of alarm was to ring along from steeple to steeple,\r\nfrom city to hamlet, from valley to hill-side, till the whole\r\nCatholic population should be aroused to obliterate every vestige of\r\nProtestantism from the land.\r\n\r\nWhile Catharine and Charles were arranging all the details of this\r\ndeed of infamy, even to the very last moment they maintained with the\r\nProtestants the appearance of the most cordial friendship. They\r\nlavished caresses upon the Protestant generals and nobles. The very\r\nday preceding the night when the massacre commenced, the king\r\nentertained, at a sumptuous feast in the Louvre, many of the most\r\nillustrious of the doomed guests. Many of the Protestant nobles were\r\nthat night, by the most pressing invitations, detained in the palace\r\nto sleep. Charles appeared in a glow of amiable spirits, and amused\r\nthem, till a late hour, with his pleasantries.\r\n\r\nHenry of Navarre, however, had his suspicions very strongly aroused.\r\nThough he did not and could not imagine any thing so dreadful as a\r\ngeneral massacre, he clearly foresaw that preparations were making for\r\nsome very extraordinary event. The entire depravity of both Catharine\r\nand Charles he fully understood. But he knew not where the blow would\r\nfall, and he was extremely perplexed in deciding as to the course he\r\nought to pursue. The apartments assigned to him and his bride were in\r\nthe palace of the Louvre. It would be so manifestly for his worldly\r\ninterest for him to unite with the Catholic party, especially when he\r\nshould see the Protestant cause hopelessly ruined, that the mother and\r\nthe brother of his wife had hesitatingly concluded that it would be\r\nsafe to spare his life. Many of the most conspicuous members of the\r\ncourt of Navarre lodged also in the capacious palace, in chambers\r\ncontiguous to those which were occupied by their sovereign.\r\n\r\nMarguerite's oldest sister had married the Duke of Lorraine, and her\r\nson, the Duke of Guise, an energetic, ambitious, unprincipled\r\nprofligate, was one of the most active agents in this conspiracy. His\r\nillustrious rank, his near relationship with the king--rendering it\r\nnot improbable that he might yet inherit the throne--his restless\r\nactivity, and his implacable hatred of the Protestants, gave him the\r\nmost prominent position as the leader of the Catholic party. He had\r\noften encountered the Admiral Coligni upon fields of battle, where all\r\nthe malignity of the human heart had been aroused, and he had often\r\nbeen compelled to fly before the strong arm of his powerful adversary.\r\nHe felt that now the hour of revenge had come, and with an assassin's\r\ndespicable heart he thirsted for the blood of his noble foe. It was\r\none of his paid agents who fired upon the admiral from the window,\r\nand, mounted upon one of the fleetest chargers of the Duke of Guise,\r\nthe wretch made his escape.\r\n\r\nThe conspiracy had been kept a profound secret from Marguerite, lest\r\nshe should divulge it to her husband. The Duchess of Lorraine,\r\nhowever, was in all their deliberations, and, fully aware of the\r\ndreadful carnage which the night was to witness, she began to feel, as\r\nthe hour of midnight approached, very considerable anxiety in\r\nreference to the safety of her sister. Conscious guilt magnified her\r\nfears; and she was apprehensive lest the Protestants, when they should\r\nfirst awake to the treachery which surrounded them, would rush to the\r\nchamber of their king to protect him, and would wreak their vengeance\r\nupon his Catholic spouse. She did not dare to communicate to her\r\nsister the cause of her alarm; and yet, when Marguerite, about 11\r\no'clock, arose to retire, she importuned her sister, even with tears,\r\nnot to occupy the same apartment with her husband that night, but to\r\nsleep in her own private chamber. Catharine sharply reproved the\r\nDuchess of Lorraine for her imprudent remonstrances, and bidding the\r\nQueen of Navarre good-night, with maternal authority directed her to\r\nrepair to the room of her husband. She departed to the nuptial\r\nchamber, wondering what could be the cause of such an unwonted display\r\nof sisterly solicitude and affection.\r\n\r\nWhen she entered her room, to her great surprise she found thirty or\r\nforty gentlemen assembled there. They were the friends and the\r\nsupporters of Henry, who had become alarmed by the mysterious rumors\r\nwhich were floating from ear to ear, and by the signs of agitation,\r\nand secrecy, and strange preparation which every where met the eye. No\r\none could imagine what danger was impending. No one knew from what\r\nquarter the storm would burst. But that some very extraordinary event\r\nwas about to transpire was evident to all. It was too late to adopt\r\nany precautions for safety. The Protestants, unarmed, unorganized, and\r\nwidely dispersed, could now only practice the virtue of heroic\r\nfortitude in meeting their doom, whatever that doom might be. The\r\ngentlemen in Henry's chamber did not venture to separate, and not an\r\neye was closed in sleep. They sat together in the deepest perplexity\r\nand consternation, as the hours of the night lingered slowly along,\r\nanxiously awaiting the developments with which the moments seemed to\r\nbe fraught.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, aided by the gloom of a starless night, in every\r\nstreet of Paris preparations were going on for the enormous\r\nperpetration. Soldiers were assembling in different places of\r\nrendezvous. Guards were stationed at important points in the city,\r\nthat their victims might not escape. Armed citizens, with loaded\r\nmuskets and sabres gleaming in the lamplight, began to emerge, through\r\nthe darkness, from their dwellings, and to gather, in motley and\r\ninterminable assemblage, around the Hotel de Ville. A regiment of\r\nguards were stationed at the gates of the royal palace to protect\r\nCharles and Catharine from any possibility of danger. Many of the\r\nhouses were illuminated, that by the light blazing from the windows,\r\nthe bullet might be thrown with precision, and that the dagger might\r\nstrike an unerring blow. Agitation and alarm pervaded the vast\r\nmetropolis. The Catholics were rejoicing that the hour of vengeance\r\nhad arrived. The Protestants gazed upon the portentous gatherings of\r\nthis storm in utter bewilderment.\r\n\r\nAll the arrangements of the enterprise were left to the Duke of Guise,\r\nand a more efficient and fitting agent could not have been found. He\r\nhad ordered that the tocsin, the signal for the massacre, should be\r\ntolled at two o'clock in the morning. Catharine and Charles, in one of\r\nthe apartments of the palace of the Louvre, were impatiently awaiting\r\nthe lingering flight of the hours till the alarm-bell should toll\r\nforth the death-warrant of their Protestant subjects. Catharine,\r\ninured to treachery and hardened in vice, was apparently a stranger to\r\nall compunctious visitings. A life of crime had steeled her soul\r\nagainst every merciful impression. But she was very apprehensive lest\r\nher son, less obdurate in purpose, might relent. Though impotent in\r\ncharacter, he was, at times, petulant and self-willed, and in\r\nparoxysms of stubbornness spurned his mother's counsels and exerted\r\nhis own despotic power.\r\n\r\nCharles was now in a state of the most feverish excitement. He hastily\r\npaced the room, peering out at the window, and almost every moment\r\nlooking at his watch, wishing that the hour would come, and again half\r\nregretting that the plot had been formed. The companions and the\r\nfriends of his childhood, the invited guests who, for many weeks, had\r\nbeen his associates in gay festivities, and in the interchange of all\r\nkindly words and deeds, were, at his command, before the morning\r\nshould dawn, to fall before the bullet and the poniard of the midnight\r\nmurderer. His mother witnessed with intense anxiety this wavering of\r\nhis mind. She therefore urged him no longer to delay, but to\r\nanticipate the hour, and to send a servant immediately to sound the\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\nCharles hesitated, while a cold sweat ran from his forehead. \"Are you\r\na coward?\" tauntingly inquired the fiendlike mother. This is the\r\ncharge which will always make the poltroon squirm. The young king\r\nnervously exclaimed, \"Well, then, begin.\"\r\n\r\nThere were in the chamber at the time only the king, his mother, and\r\nhis brother the Duke of Anjou. A messenger was immediately dispatched\r\nto strike the bell. It was two hours after midnight. A few moments of\r\nterrible suspense ensued. There was a dead silence, neither of the\r\nthree uttering a word. They all stood at the windows looking out into\r\nthe rayless night. Suddenly, through the still air, the ponderous\r\ntones of the alarm-bell fell upon the ear, and rolled, the knell of\r\ndeath, over the city. Its vibrations awakened the demon in ten\r\nthousand hearts. It was the morning of the Sabbath, August 24th, 1572.\r\nIt was the anniversary of a festival in honor of St. Bartholomew,\r\nwhich had long been celebrated. At the sound of the tocsin, the signal\r\nfor the massacre, armed men rushed from every door into the streets,\r\nshouting, \"_Vive Dieu et le roi!_\"--_Live God and the king!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMASSACRE OF ST.

The sound\r\nseemed to animate to frenzy the demoniac Catharine, while it almost\r\nfroze the blood in the veins of the young monarch, and he passionately\r\ncalled out for the massacre to be stopped. It was too late. The train\r\nwas fired, and could not be extinguished. The signal passed with the\r\nrapidity of sound from steeple to steeple, till not only Paris, but\r\nentire France, was roused. The roar of human passion, the crackling\r\nfire of musketry, and the shrieks of the wounded and the dying, rose\r\nand blended in one fearful din throughout the whole metropolis. Guns,\r\npistols, daggers, were every where busy. Old men, terrified maidens,\r\nhelpless infants, venerable matrons, were alike smitten, and mercy\r\nhad no appeal which could touch the heart of the murderers.\r\n\r\nThe wounded Admiral Coligni was lying helpless upon his bed,\r\nsurrounded by a few personal friends, as the uproar of the rising\r\nstorm of human violence and rage rolled in upon their ears. The Duke\r\nof Guise, with three hundred soldiers, hastened to the lodgings of the\r\nadmiral. The gates were immediately knocked down, and the sentinels\r\nstabbed. A servant, greatly terrified, rushed into the inner apartment\r\nwhere the wounded admiral was lying, and exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"The house is forced, and there is no means of resisting.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have long since,\" said the admiral, calmly, \"prepared myself to\r\ndie. Save yourselves, my friends, if you can, for you can not defend\r\nmy life. I commend my soul to the mercy of God.\"\r\n\r\nThe companions of the admiral, having no possible means of protection,\r\nand perhaps adding to his peril by their presence, immediately fled to\r\nother apartments of the house. They were pursued and stabbed. Three\r\nleaped from the windows and were shot in the streets.\r\n\r\nColigni, left alone in his apartment, rose with difficulty from his\r\nbed, and, being unable to stand, leaned for support against the wall.\r\nA desperado by the name of Breme, a follower of the Duke of Guise,\r\nwith a congenial band of accomplices, rushed into the room. They saw a\r\nvenerable man, pale, and with bandaged wounds, in his night-dress,\r\nengaged in prayer.\r\n\r\n\"Art thou the admiral?\" demanded the assassin, with brandished sword.\r\n\r\n\"I am,\" replied the admiral; \"and thou, young man, shouldst respect my\r\ngray hairs. Nevertheless, thou canst abridge my life but a little.\"\r\n\r\nBreme plunged his sword into his bosom, and then withdrawing it, gave\r\nhim a cut upon the head. The admiral fell, calmly saying, \"If I could\r\nbut die by the hand of a gentleman instead of such a knave as this!\"\r\nThe rest of the assassins then rushed upon him, piercing his body with\r\ntheir daggers.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Guise, ashamed himself to meet the eye of this noble\r\nvictim to the basest treachery, remained impatiently in the court-yard\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n\"Breme!\" he shouted, looking up at the window, \"have you done it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Breme exclaimed from the chamber, \"he is done for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us see, though,\" rejoined the duke. \"Throw the body from the\r\nwindow.\"\r\n\r\nThe mangled corpse was immediately thrown down upon the pavement of\r\nthe court-yard. The duke, with his handkerchief, wiped the blood and\r\nthe dirt from his face, and carefully scrutinized the features.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"I recognize him. He is the man.\"\r\n\r\nThen giving the pallid cheek a kick, he exclaimed, \"Courage, comrades!\r\nwe have happily begun. Let us now go for others. The king commands\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nIn sixteen years from this event the Duke of Guise was himself\r\nassassinated, and received a kick in the face from Henry III., brother\r\nof the same king in whose service he had drawn the dagger of the\r\nmurderer. Thus died the Admiral Coligni, one of the noblest sons of\r\nFrance. Though but fifty-six years of age, he was prematurely infirm\r\nfrom care, and toil, and suffering.\r\n\r\nFor three days the body was exposed to the insults of the populace,\r\nand finally was hung up by the feet on a gibbet. A cousin of Coligni\r\nsecretly caused it to be taken down and buried.\r\n\r\nThe tiger, having once lapped his tongue in blood, seems to be imbued\r\nwith a new spirit of ferocity. There is in man a similar temper, which\r\nis roused and stimulated by carnage. The excitement of human slaughter\r\nconverts man into a demon. The riotous multitude of Parisians was\r\nbecoming each moment more and more clamorous for blood. They broke\r\nopen the houses of the Protestants, and, rushing into their chambers,\r\nmurdered indiscriminately both sexes and every age. The streets\r\nresounded with the shouts of the assassins and the shrieks of their\r\nvictims. Cries of \"Kill! kill! more blood!\" rent the air. The bodies\r\nof the slain were thrown out of the windows into the streets, and the\r\npavements of the city were clotted with human gore.\r\n\r\nCharles, who was overwhelmed with such compunctions of conscience when\r\nhe heard the first shot, and beheld from his window the commencement\r\nof the butchery, soon recovered from his momentary wavering, and,\r\nconscious that it was too late to draw back, with fiendlike eagerness\r\nengaged himself in the work of death. The monarch, when a boy, had\r\nbeen noted for his sanguinary spirit, delighting with his own hand to\r\nperform the revolting acts of the slaughter-house. Perfect fury seemed\r\nnow to take possession of him. His cheeks were flushed, his lips\r\ncompressed, his eyes glared with frenzy. Bending eagerly from his\r\nwindow, he shouted words of encouragement to the assassins. Grasping a\r\ngun, in the handling of which he had become very skillful from long\r\npractice in the chase, he watched, like a sportsman, for his prey; and\r\nwhen he saw an unfortunate Protestant, wounded and bleeding, flying\r\nfrom his pursuers, he would take deliberate aim from the window of his\r\npalace, and shout with exultation as he saw him fall, pierced by his\r\nbullet. A crowd of fugitives rushed into the court-yard of the Louvre\r\nto throw themselves upon the protection of the king. Charles sent his\r\nown body-guard into the yard, with guns and daggers, to butcher them\r\nall, and the pavements of the palace-yard were drenched with their\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MASSACRE OF ST. BARTHOLOMEW.]\r\n\r\nJust before the carnage commenced, Marguerite, weary with excitement\r\nand the agitating conversation to which she had so long been\r\nlistening, retired to her private apartment for sleep. She had hardly\r\nclosed her eyes when the fearful outcries of the pursuers and the\r\npursued filled the palace. She sprang up in her bed, and heard some\r\none struggling at the door, and shrieking \"Navarre! Navarre!\" In a\r\nparoxysm of terror, she ordered an attendant to open the door. One\r\nof her husband's retinue instantly rushed in, covered with wounds and\r\nblood, pursued by four soldiers of her brother's guard. The captain of\r\nthe guard entered at the same moment, and, at the earnest entreaty of\r\nthe princess, spared her the anguish of seeing the friend of her\r\nhusband murdered before her eyes.\r\n\r\nMarguerite, half delirious with bewilderment and terror, fled from her\r\nroom to seek the apartment of her sister. The palace was filled with\r\nuproar, the shouts of the assassins and the shrieks of their victims\r\nblending in awful confusion. As she was rushing through the hall, she\r\nencountered another Protestant gentleman flying before the dripping\r\nsword of his pursuer. He was covered with blood, flowing from the many\r\nwounds he had already received. Just as he reached the young Queen of\r\nNavarre, his pursuer overtook him and plunged a sword through his\r\nbody. He fell dead at her feet.\r\n\r\nNo tongue can tell the horrors of that night. It would require volumes\r\nto record the frightful scenes which were enacted before the morning\r\ndawned. Among the most remarkable escapes we may mention that of a lad\r\nwhose name afterward attained much celebrity. The Baron de Rosny, a\r\nProtestant lord of great influence and worth, had accompanied his son\r\nMaximilian, a very intelligent and spirited boy, about eleven years of\r\nage, to Paris, to attend the nuptials of the King of Navarre. This\r\nyoung prince, Maximilian, afterward the world-renowned Duke of Sully,\r\nhad previously been prosecuting his studies in the College of\r\nBurgundy, in the metropolis, and had become a very great favorite of\r\nthe warm-hearted King of Navarre. His father had come to Paris with\r\ngreat reluctance, for he had no confidence in the protestations of\r\nCatharine and Charles IX. Immediately after the attempt was made to\r\nassassinate the admiral, the Baron de Rosny, with many of his friends,\r\nleft the city, intrusting his son to the care of a private tutor and a\r\nvalet de chambre. He occupied lodgings in a remote quarter of the city\r\nand near the colleges.\r\n\r\nYoung Maximilian was asleep in his room, when, a little after\r\nmidnight, he was aroused by the ringing of the alarm-bells, and the\r\nconfused cries of the populace. His tutor and valet de chambre sprang\r\nfrom their beds, and hurried out to ascertain the cause of the tumult.\r\nThey did not, however, return, for they had hardly reached the door\r\nwhen they were shot down. Maximilian, in great bewilderment respecting\r\ntheir continued absence, and the dreadful clamor continually\r\nincreasing, was hurriedly dressing himself, when his landlord came in,\r\npale and trembling, and informed him of the massacre which was going\r\non, and that he had saved his own life only by the avowal of his faith\r\nin the Catholic religion. He earnestly urged Maximilian to do the\r\nsame. The young prince magnanimously resolved not to save his life by\r\nfalsehood and apostasy. He determined to attempt, in the darkness and\r\nconfusion of the night, to gain the College of Burgundy, where he\r\nhoped to find some Catholic friends who would protect him.\r\n\r\nThe distance of the college from the house in which he was rendered\r\nthe undertaking desperately perilous. Having disguised himself in the\r\ndress of a Roman Catholic priest, he took a large prayer-book under\r\nhis arm, and tremblingly issued forth into the streets. The sights\r\nwhich met his eye in the gloom of that awful night were enough to\r\nappal the stoutest heart. The murderers, frantic with excitement and\r\nintoxication, were uttering wild outcries, and pursuing, in every\r\ndirection, their terrified victims. Women and children, in their\r\nnight-clothes, having just sprung in terror from their beds, were\r\nflying from their pursuers, covered with wounds, and uttering fearful\r\nshrieks. The mangled bodies of the young and of the old, of males and\r\nfemales, were strewn along the streets, and the pavements were\r\nslippery with blood. Loud and dreadful outcries were heard from the\r\ninterior of the dwellings as the work of midnight assassination\r\nproceeded; and struggles of desperate violence were witnessed, as the\r\nmurderers attempted to throw their bleeding and dying victims from the\r\nhigh windows of chambers and attics upon the pavements below. The\r\nshouts of the assailants, the shrieks of the wounded, as blow after\r\nblow fell upon them, the incessant reports of muskets and pistols, the\r\ntramp of soldiers, and the peals of the alarm-bell, all combined to\r\ncreate a scene of terror such as human eyes have seldom witnessed. In\r\nthe midst of ten thousand perils, the young man crept along, protected\r\nby his priestly garb, while he frequently saw his fellow-Christians\r\nshot and stabbed at his very side.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, in turning a corner, he fell into the midst of a band of the\r\nbody-guard of the king, whose swords were dripping with blood. They\r\nseized him with great roughness, when, seeing the Catholic\r\nprayer-book which was in his hands, they considered it a safe\r\npassport, and permitted him to continue on his way uninjured. Twice\r\nagain he encountered similar peril, as he was seized by bands of\r\ninfuriated men, and each time he was extricated in the same way.\r\n\r\nAt length he arrived at the College of Burgundy; and now his danger\r\nincreased tenfold. It was a Catholic college. The porter at the gate\r\nabsolutely refused him admittance. The murderers began to multiply in\r\nthe street around him with fierce and threatening questions.\r\nMaximilian at length, by inquiring for La Faye, the president of the\r\ncollege, and by placing a bribe in the hands of the porter, succeeded\r\nin obtaining entrance. La Faye was a humane man, and exceedingly\r\nattached to his Protestant pupil. Maximilian entered the apartment of\r\nthe president, and found there two Catholic priests. The priests, as\r\nsoon as they saw him, insisted upon cutting him down, declaring that\r\nthe king had commanded that not even the infant at the breast should\r\nbe spared. The good old man, however, firmly resolved to protect his\r\nyoung friend, and, conducting him privately to a secure chamber,\r\nlocked him up. Here he remained three days in the greatest suspense,\r\napprehensive every hour that the assassins would break in upon him. A\r\nfaithful servant of the president brought him food, but could tell him\r\nof nothing but deeds of treachery and blood. At the end of three days,\r\nthe heroic boy, who afterward attained great celebrity as the minister\r\nand bosom friend of Henry, was released and protected.\r\n\r\nThe morning of St. Bartholomew's day had not dawned when a band of\r\nsoldiers entered the chamber of Henry of Navarre and conveyed him to\r\nthe presence of the king. Frenzied with the excitements of the scene,\r\nthe imbecile but passionate monarch received him with a countenance\r\ninflamed with fury. With blasphemous oaths and imprecations, he\r\ncommanded the King of Navarre, as he valued his life, to abandon a\r\nreligion which Charles affirmed that the Protestants had assumed only\r\nas a cloak for their rebellion. With violent gesticulations and\r\nthreats, he declared that he would no longer submit to be contradicted\r\nby his subjects, but that they should revere him as the image of God.\r\nHenry, who was a Protestant from considerations of state policy rather\r\nthan from Christian principle, and who saw in the conflict merely a\r\nstrife between two political parties, ingloriously yielded to that\r\nnecessity by which alone he could save his life. Charles gave him\r\nthree days to deliberate, declaring, with a violent oath, that if, at\r\nthe end of that time, he did not yield to his commands, he would cause\r\nhim to be strangled. Henry yielded. He not only went to mass himself,\r\nbut submitted to the degradation of sending an edict to his own\r\ndominions, prohibiting the exercise of any religion except that of\r\nRome. This indecision was a serious blot upon his character. Energetic\r\nand decisive as he was in all his measures of government, his\r\nreligious convictions were ever feeble and wavering.\r\n\r\nWhen the darkness of night passed away and the morning of the Sabbath\r\ndawned upon Paris, a spectacle was witnessed such as the streets even\r\nof that blood-renowned metropolis have seldom presented. The city\r\nstill resounded with that most awful of all tumults, the clamor of an\r\ninfuriated mob. The pavements were covered with gory corpses. Men,\r\nwomen, and children were still flying in every direction, wounded and\r\nbleeding, pursued by merciless assassins, riotous with demoniac\r\nlaughter and drunk with blood. The report of guns and pistols was\r\nheard in all parts of the city, sometimes in continuous volleys, as if\r\nplatoons of soldiers were firing upon their victims, while the\r\nscattered shots, incessantly repeated in every section of the extended\r\nmetropolis, proved the universality of the massacre. Drunken wretches,\r\nbesmeared with blood, were swaggering along the streets, with ribald\r\njests and demoniac howlings, hunting for the Protestants. Bodies, torn\r\nand gory, were hanging from the windows, and dissevered heads were\r\nspurned like footballs along the pavements. Priests were seen in their\r\nsacerdotal robes, with elevated crucifixes, and with fanatical\r\nexclamations encouraging the murderers not to grow weary in their holy\r\nwork of exterminating God's enemies. The most distinguished nobles and\r\ngenerals of the court and the camp of Charles, mounted on horseback\r\nwith gorgeous retinue, rode through the streets, encouraging by voice\r\nand arm the indiscriminate massacre.\r\n\r\n\"Let not,\" the king proclaimed, \"one single Protestant be spared to\r\nreproach me hereafter with this deed.\"\r\n\r\nFor a whole week the massacre continued, and it was computed that from\r\neighty to a hundred thousand Protestants were slain throughout the\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nCharles himself, with Catharine and the highborn but profligate ladies\r\nwho disgraced her court, emerged with the morning light, in splendid\r\narray, into the reeking streets. The ladies contemplated with\r\nmerriment and ribald jests the dead bodies of the Protestants piled up\r\nbefore the Louvre. Some of the retinue, appalled by the horrid\r\nspectacle, wished to retire, alleging that the bodies already emitted\r\na putrid odor. Charles inhumanly replied, \"The smell of a dead enemy\r\nis always pleasant.\"\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, after four days spent in hunting out the fugitives\r\nand finishing the bloody work, the clergy paraded the streets\r\nin a triumphal procession, and with jubilant prayers and hymns gave\r\nthanks to God for their great victory. The Catholic pulpits resounded\r\nwith exultant harangues, and in honor of the event a medallion\r\nwas struck off, with the inscription \"_La piété a reveille la\r\njustice_\"--_Religion has awakened justice_.\r\n\r\nIn the distant provinces of France the massacre was continued, as the\r\nProtestants were hunted from all their hiding-places. In some\r\ndepartments, as in Santonge and Lower Languedoc, the Protestants were\r\nso numerous that the Catholics did not venture to attack them. In\r\nsome other provinces they were so few that the Catholics had nothing\r\nwhatever to fear from them, and therefore spared them; and in the\r\nsparsely-settled rural districts the peasants refused to imbrue their\r\nhands in the blood of their neighbors. Many thousand Protestants\r\nthroughout the kingdom in these ways escaped.\r\n\r\nBut in nearly all the populous towns, where the Catholic population\r\npredominated, the massacre was universal and indiscriminate. In Meaux,\r\nfour hundred houses of Protestants were pillaged and devastated, and\r\nthe inmates, without regard to age or sex, utterly exterminated. At\r\nOrleans there were three thousand Protestants. A troop of armed\r\nhorsemen rode furiously through the streets, shouting, \"Courage, boys!\r\nkill all, and then you shall divide their property.\" At Rouen, many of\r\nthe Protestants, at the first alarm, fled. The rest were arrested and\r\nthrown into prison. They were then brought out one by one, and\r\ndeliberately murdered. Six hundred were thus slain. Such were the\r\nscenes which were enacted in Toulouse, Bordeaux, Bourges, Angers,\r\nLyons, and scores of other cities in France. It is impossible to\r\nascertain with precision the number of victims. The Duke of Sully\r\nestimates them at seventy thousand; the Bishop Péréfixe at one\r\nhundred thousand. This latter estimate is probably not exaggerated, if\r\nwe include the unhappy fugitives, who, fleeing from their homes, died\r\nof cold, hunger, and fatigue, and all the other nameless woes which\r\naccrued from this great calamity.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these scenes of horror it is pleasant to record\r\nseveral instances of generous humanity. In the barbarism of those\r\ntimes dueling was a common practice. A Catholic officer by the name of\r\nVessins, one of the most fierce and irritable men in France, had a\r\nprivate quarrel with a Protestant officer whose name was Regnier. They\r\nhad mutually sought each other in Paris to obtain such satisfaction as\r\na duel could afford. In the midst of the massacre, Regnier, while at\r\nprayers with his servant (for in those days dueling and praying were\r\nnot deemed inconsistent), heard the door of his room broken open, and,\r\nlooking round in expectation of instant death, saw his foe Vessins\r\nenter breathless with excitement and haste. Regnier, conscious that\r\nall resistance would be unavailing, calmly bared his bosom to his\r\nenemy, exclaiming,\r\n\r\n\"You will have an easy victory.\"\r\n\r\nVessins made no reply, but ordered the valet to seek his master's\r\ncloak and sword. Then leading him into the street, he mounted him upon\r\na powerful horse, and with fifteen armed men escorted him out of the\r\ncity. Not a word was exchanged between them. When they arrived at a\r\nlittle grove at a short distance from the residence of the Protestant\r\ngentleman, Vessins presented him with his sword, and bade him dismount\r\nand defend himself, saying,\r\n\r\n\"Do not imagine that I seek your friendship by what I have done. All I\r\nwish is to take your life honorably.\"\r\n\r\nRegnier threw away his sword, saying, \"I will never strike at one who\r\nhas saved my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well!\" Vessins replied, and left him, making him a present of\r\nthe horse on which he rode.\r\n\r\nThough the commands which the king sent to the various provinces of\r\nFrance for the massacre were very generally obeyed, there were\r\nexamples of distinguished virtue, in which Catholics of high rank not\r\nonly refused to imbrue their own hands in blood, but periled their\r\nlives to protect the Protestants. The Bishop of Lisieux, in the\r\nexercise of true Christian charity, saved all the Protestants in the\r\ntown over which he presided. The Governor of Auvergne replied to the\r\nsecret letter of the king in the following words:\r\n\r\n     \"Sire, I have received an order, under your majesty's seal,\r\n     to put all the Protestants of this province to death, and\r\n     if, which God forbid, the order be genuine, I respect your\r\n     majesty still too much to obey you.\"\r\n\r\nThe king had sent a similar order to the commandant at Bayonne, the\r\nViscount of Orthez. The following noble words were returned in reply:\r\n\r\n     \"Sire, I have communicated the commands of your majesty to\r\n     the inhabitants of the town and to the soldiers of the\r\n     garrison, and I have found good citizens and brave soldiers,\r\n     _but not one executioner_; on which account, they and I\r\n     humbly beseech you to employ our arms and our lives in\r\n     enterprises in which we can conscientiously engage. However\r\n     perilous they may be, we will willingly shed therein the\r\n     last drop of our blood.\"\r\n\r\nBoth of these noble-minded men soon after very suddenly and\r\nmysteriously died. Few entertained a doubt that poison had been\r\nadministered by the order of Charles.\r\n\r\nThe _law_ of France required that these Protestants should be hunted\r\nto death. This was _the law_ promulgated by the king and sent by his\r\nown letters missive to the appointed officers of the crown.\r\n\r\nBut there is--_there is_ a HIGHER LAW than that of kings and courts.\r\nNobly these majestic men rendered to it their allegiance. They sealed\r\ntheir fidelity to this HIGHER LAW with their blood. They were martyrs,\r\nnot fanatics.\r\n\r\nOn the third day of the massacre the king assembled the Parliament in\r\nParis, and made a public avowal of the part he had taken in this\r\nfearful tragedy, and of the reasons which had influenced him to the\r\ndeed. Though he hoped to silence all Protestant tongues in his own\r\nrealms in death, he knew that the tale would be told throughout all\r\nEurope. He therefore stated, in justification of the act, that he had,\r\n\"as if by a miracle,\" discovered that the Protestants were engaged in\r\na conspiracy against his own life and that of all of his family.\r\n\r\nThis charge, however, uttered for the moment, was speedily dropped and\r\nforgotten. There was not the slightest evidence of such a design.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament, to give a little semblance of justice to the king's\r\naccusation, sat in judgment upon the memory of the noble Coligni. They\r\nsentenced him to be hung in effigy; ordered his arms to be dragged at\r\nthe heels of a horse through all the principal towns of France; his\r\nmagnificent castle of Chatillon to be razed to its foundations, and\r\nnever to be rebuilt; his fertile acres, in the culture of which he had\r\nfound his chief delight, to be desolated and sown with salt; his\r\nportraits and statues, wherever found, to be destroyed; his children\r\nto lose their title of nobility; all his goods and estates to be\r\nconfiscated to the use of the crown, and a monument of durable marble\r\nto be raised, upon which this sentence of the court should be\r\nengraved, to transmit to all posterity his alleged infamy. Thus was\r\npunished on earth one of the noblest servants both of God and man. But\r\nthere is a day of final judgment yet to come. The oppressor has but\r\nhis brief hour. There is eternity to right the oppressed.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this general and awful massacre, the Protestants were\r\nfar from being exterminated. Several nobles, surrounded by their\r\nretainers in their distant castles, suspicious of treachery, had\r\nrefused to go to Paris to attend the wedding of Henry and Marguerite.\r\nOthers who had gone to Paris, alarmed by the attack upon Admiral\r\nColigni, immediately retired to their homes. Some concealed themselves\r\nin garrets, cellars, and wells until the massacre was over. As has\r\nbeen stated, in some towns the governors refused to engage in the\r\nmerciless butchery, and in others the Protestants had the majority,\r\nand with their own arms could defend themselves within the walls which\r\ntheir own troops garrisoned.\r\n\r\nThough, in the first panic caused by the dreadful slaughter, the\r\nProtestants made no resistance, but either surrendered themselves\r\nsubmissively to the sword of the assassin, or sought safety in\r\nconcealment or flight, soon indignation took the place of fear. Those\r\nwho had fled from the kingdom to Protestant states rallied together.\r\nThe survivors in France began to count their numbers and marshal their\r\nforces for self-preservation. From every part of Protestant Europe a\r\ncry of horror and execration simultaneously arose in view of this\r\ncrime of unparalleled enormity. In many places the Catholics\r\nthemselves seemed appalled in contemplation of the deed they had\r\nperpetrated. Words of sympathy were sent to these martyrs to a pure\r\nfaith from many of the Protestant kingdoms, with pledges of determined\r\nand efficient aid. The Protestants rapidly gained courage. From all\r\nthe country, they flocked into those walled towns which still\r\nremained in their power.\r\n\r\nAs the fugitives from France, emaciate, pale, and woe-stricken, with\r\ntattered and dusty garb, recited in England, Switzerland, and Germany\r\nthe horrid story of the massacre, the hearts of their auditors were\r\nfrozen with horror. In Geneva a day of fasting and prayer was\r\ninstituted, which is observed even to the present day. In Scotland\r\nevery church resounded with the thrilling tale; and Knox, whose\r\ninflexible spirit was nerved for those iron times, exclaimed, in\r\nlanguage of prophetic nerve,\r\n\r\n\"Sentence has gone forth against that murderer, the King of France,\r\nand the vengeance of God will never be withdrawn from his house. His\r\nname shall be held in everlasting execration.\"\r\n\r\nThe French court, alarmed by the indignation it had aroused, sent an\r\nembassador to London with a poor apology for the crime, by pretending\r\nthat the Protestants had conspired against the life of the king. The\r\nembassador was received in the court of the queen with appalling\r\ncoldness and gloom. Arrangements were made to invest the occasion with\r\nthe most impressive solemnity. The court was shrouded in mourning,\r\nand all the lords and ladies appeared in sable weeds. A stern and\r\nsombre sadness was upon every countenance. The embassador, overwhelmed\r\nby his reception, was overheard to exclaim to himself, in bitterness\r\nof heart,\r\n\r\n\"I am ashamed to acknowledge myself a Frenchman.\"\r\n\r\nHe entered, however, the presence of the queen, passed through the\r\nlong line of silent courtiers, who refused to salute him, or even to\r\nhonor him with a look, stammered out his miserable apology, and,\r\nreceiving no response, retired covered with confusion. Elizabeth, we\r\nthank thee! This one noble deed atones for many of thy crimes.\r\n\r\nVery different was the reception of these tidings in the court of\r\nRome. The messenger who carried the news was received with transports\r\nof joy, and was rewarded with a thousand pieces of gold. Cannons were\r\nfired, bells rung, and an immense procession, with all the trappings\r\nof sacerdotal rejoicing, paraded the streets. Anthems were chanted and\r\nthanksgivings were solemnly offered for the great victory over the\r\nenemies of the Church. A gold medal was struck off to commemorate the\r\nevent; and Charles IX. and Catharine were pronounced, by the\r\ninfallible word of his holiness, to be the especial favorites of God.\r\nSpain and the Netherlands united with Rome in these infamous\r\nexultations. Philip II. wrote from Madrid to Catharine,\r\n\r\n    \"These tidings are the greatest and the most glorious I could\r\n    have received.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the awful massacre of St. Bartholomew. When contemplated in\r\nall its aspects of perfidy, cruelty, and cowardice, it must be\r\npronounced the greatest crime recorded in history. The victims were\r\ninvited under the guise of friendship to Paris. They were received\r\nwith solemn oaths of peace and protection. The leading men in the\r\nnation placed the dagger in the hands of an ignorant and degraded\r\npeople. The priests, professed ministers of Jesus Christ, stimulated\r\nthe benighted multitude by all the appeals of fanaticism to\r\nexterminate those whom they denounced as the enemies of God and man.\r\nAfter the great atrocity was perpetrated, princes and priests, with\r\nblood-stained hands, flocked to the altars of God, our common Father,\r\nto thank him that the massacre had been accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe annals of the world are filled with narratives of crime and woe,\r\nbut the Massacre of St. Bartholomew stands perhaps without a parallel.\r\n\r\nIt has been said, \"The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the\r\nChurch.\" This is only true with exceptions. Protestantism in France\r\nhas never recovered from this blow. But for this massacre one half of\r\nthe nobles of France would have continued Protestant. The Reformers\r\nwould have constituted so large a portion of the population that\r\nmutual toleration would have been necessary. Henry IV. would not have\r\nabjured the Protestant faith. Intelligence would have been diffused;\r\nreligion would have been respected; and in all probability, the\r\nhorrors of the French Revolution would have been averted.\r\n\r\nGod is an avenger. In the mysterious government which he wields,\r\nmysterious only to our feeble vision, he \"visits the iniquities of the\r\nfathers upon the children, even unto the third and fourth generation.\"\r\nAs we see the priests of Paris and of France, during the awful tragedy\r\nof the Revolution, massacred in the prisons, shot in the streets, hung\r\nupon the lamp-posts, and driven in starvation and woe from the\r\nkingdom, we can not but remember the day of St. Bartholomew. The 24th\r\nof August, 1572, and the 2d of September, 1792, though far apart in\r\nthe records of time, are consecutive days in the government of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSES OF VALOIS, OF GUISE, AND OF BOURBON.\r\n\r\nIllustrious French families.--The house of Valois.--Early condition\r\nof France.--Clovis.--The Carlovingian dynasty.--Capet and\r\nPhilip.--Decay of the house of Valois.--House of Guise.--The dukedom\r\nof Lorraine.--Claude of Lorraine.--Marriage of the Count of\r\nGuise.--Francis I.--The suggestion and its results.--Bravery of\r\nthe duke.--His prominence.--Days of war.--The bloody rout.--Scene\r\nfrom the castle.--Claude the Butcher.--The Cardinal of Lorraine.--The\r\nreprimand.--Duke of Mayence.--The family of Guise.--Henry the\r\nEighth.--Death of Claude.--Francis, Duke of Guise.--The dreadful\r\nwound.--Le Balafré.--Interview with the king.--Jealousy of\r\nthe king.--Arrogance of the Guises.--Power of the house of\r\nGuise.--Appointment of Francis.--Thralldom of Henry II.--Mary, Queen\r\nof Scots.--Francis II.--Troubles between the Protestants and\r\nCatholics.--Admiral Coligni.--Antoinette.--Massacre by the Duke of\r\nGuise.--The Butcher of Vassy.--Remonstrance to the queen.--Magnanimity\r\nof the Duke of Guise.--Religious wars.--Assassination of the Duke of\r\nGuise.--Death of the duke.--Jean Poltrot.--Anecdote.--Prediction of\r\nFrancis.--Enthusiasm of the populace.--The house of Bourbon.--The\r\nhouses united.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time, in France, there were three illustrious and rival\r\nfamilies, prominent above all others. Their origin was lost in the\r\nremoteness of antiquity. Their renown had been accumulating for many\r\ngenerations, through rank, and wealth, and power, and deeds of heroic\r\nand semi-barbarian daring. As these three families are so blended in\r\nall the struggles of this most warlike period, it is important to give\r\na brief history of their origin and condition.\r\n\r\n1. _The House of Valois._ More than a thousand years before the birth\r\nof Christ, we get dim glimpses of France, or, as it was then called,\r\nGaul. It was peopled by a barbarian race, divided into petty tribes or\r\nclans, each with its chieftain, and each possessing undefined and\r\nsometimes almost unlimited power. Age after age rolled on, during\r\nwhich generations came and went like ocean billows, and all Gaul was\r\nbut a continued battle-field. The history of each individual of its\r\ncountless millions seems to have been, that he was born, killed as\r\nmany of his fellow-creatures as he could, and then, having acquired\r\nthus much of glory, died.\r\n\r\nAbout fifty years before the birth of Christ, Cæsar, with his\r\nconquering hosts, swept through the whole country, causing its rivers\r\nto run red with blood, until the subjugated Gauls submitted to Roman\r\nsway. In the decay of the Roman empire, about four hundred years after\r\nChrist, the Franks, from Germany, a barbarian horde as ferocious as\r\nwolves, penetrated the northern portion of Gaul, and, obtaining\r\npermanent settlement there, gave the whole country the name of France.\r\nClovis was the chieftain of this warlike tribe. In the course of a few\r\nyears, France was threatened with another invasion by combined hordes\r\nof barbarians from the north. The chiefs of the several independent\r\ntribes in France found it necessary to unite to repel the foe. They\r\nchose Clovis as their leader. This was the origin of the French\r\nmonarchy. He was but little elevated above the surrounding chieftains,\r\nbut by intrigue and power perpetuated his supremacy. For about three\r\nhundred years the family of Clovis retained its precarious and\r\noft-contested elevation. At last, this line, enervated by luxury,\r\nbecame extinct, and another family obtained the throne. This new\r\ndynasty, under Pepin, was called the Carlovingian. The crown descended\r\ngenerally from father to son for about two hundred years, when the\r\nlast of the race was poisoned by his wife. This family has been\r\nrendered very illustrious, both by Pepin and by his son, the still\r\nmore widely renowned Charlemagne.\r\n\r\nHugh Capet then succeeded in grasping the sceptre, and for three\r\nhundred years the Capets held at bay the powerful chieftains who\r\nalternately assailed and defended the throne. Thirteen hundred years\r\nafter Christ, the last of the Capets was borne to his tomb, and the\r\nfeudal lords gave the pre-eminence to Philip of Valois. For about two\r\nhundred years the house of Valois had reigned. At the period of which\r\nwe treat in this history, luxury and vice had brought the family near\r\nto extinction.\r\n\r\nCharles IX., who now occupied the throne under the rigorous rule of\r\nhis infamous mother, was feeble in body and still more feeble in mind.\r\nHe had no child, and there was no probability that he would ever be\r\nblessed with an heir. His exhausted constitution indicated that a\r\npremature death was his inevitable destiny. His brother Henry, who\r\nhad been elected King of Poland, would then succeed to the throne; but\r\nhe had still less of manly character than Charles. An early death was\r\nhis unquestioned doom. At his death, if childless, the house of Valois\r\nwould become extinct. Who then should grasp the rich prize of the\r\nsceptre of France? The house of Guise and the house of Bourbon were\r\nrivals for this honor, and were mustering their strength and arraying\r\ntheir forces for the anticipated conflict. Each family could bring\r\nsuch vast influences into the struggle that no one could imagine in\r\nwhose favor victory would decide. Such was the condition of the house\r\nof Valois in France in the year 1592.\r\n\r\n2. Let us now turn to the house of Guise. No tale of fiction can\r\npresent a more fascinating collection of romantic enterprises and of\r\nwild adventures than must be recorded by the truthful historian of the\r\nhouse of Guise. On the western banks of the Rhine, between that river\r\nand the Meuse, there was the dukedom of Lorraine. It was a state of no\r\ninconsiderable wealth and power, extending over a territory of about\r\nten thousand square miles, and containing a million and a half of\r\ninhabitants. Rene II., Duke of Lorraine, was a man of great renown,\r\nand in all the pride and pomp of feudal power he energetically\r\ngoverned his little realm. His body was scarred with the wounds he had\r\nreceived in innumerable battles, and he was ever ready to head his\r\narmy of fifty thousand men, to punish any of the feudal lords around\r\nhim who trespassed upon his rights.\r\n\r\nThe wealthy old duke owned large possessions in Normandy, Picardy, and\r\nvarious other of the French provinces. He had a large family. His\r\nfifth son, Claude, was a proud-spirited boy of sixteen. Rene sent this\r\nlad to France, and endowed him with all the fertile acres, and the\r\ncastles, and the feudal rights which, in France, pertained to the\r\nnoble house of Lorraine. Young Claude of Lorraine was presented at the\r\ncourt of St. Cloud as the Count of Guise, a title derived from one of\r\nhis domains. His illustrious rank, his manly beauty, his princely\r\nbearing, his energetic mind, and brilliant talents, immediately gave\r\nhim great prominence among the glittering throng of courtiers. Louis\r\nXII. was much delighted with the young count, and wished to attach the\r\npowerful and attractive stranger to his own house by an alliance with\r\nhis daughter. The heart of the proud boy was, however, captivated by\r\nanother beauty who embellished the court of the monarch, and, turning\r\nfrom the princess royal, he sought the hand of Antoinette, an\r\nexceedingly beautiful maiden of about his own age, a daughter of the\r\nhouse of Bourbon. The wedding of this young pair was celebrated with\r\ngreat magnificence in Paris, in the presence of the whole French\r\ncourt. Claude was then but sixteen years of age.\r\n\r\nA few days after this event the infirm old king espoused the young and\r\nbeautiful sister of Henry VIII. of England. The Count of Guise was\r\nhonored with the commission of proceeding to Boulogne with several\r\nprinces of the blood to receive the royal bride. Louis soon died, and\r\nhis son, Francis I., ascended the throne. Claude was, by marriage, his\r\ncousin. He could bring all the influence of the proud house of Bourbon\r\nand the powerful house of Lorraine in support of the king. His own\r\nenergetic, fearless, war-loving spirit invested him with great power\r\nin those barbarous days of violence and blood. Francis received his\r\nyoung cousin into high favor. Claude was, indeed, a young man of very\r\nrare accomplishments. His prowess in the jousts and tournaments, then\r\nso common, and his grace and magnificence in the drawing-room,\r\nrendered him an object of universal admiration.\r\n\r\nOne night Claude accompanied Francis I. to the queen's circle. She had\r\ngathered around her the most brilliant beauty of her realm. In those\r\ndays woman occupied a very inferior position in society, and seldom\r\nmade her appearance in the general assemblages of men. The gallant\r\nyoung count was fascinated with the amiability and charms of those\r\ndistinguished ladies, and suggested to the king the expediency of\r\nbreaking over the restraints which long usage had imposed, and\r\nembellishing his court with the attractions of female society and\r\nconversation. The king immediately adopted the welcome suggestion, and\r\ndecided that, throughout the whole realm, women should be freed from\r\nthe unjust restraint to which they had so long been subject. Guise had\r\nalready gained the good-will of the nobility and of the army, and he\r\nnow became a universal favorite with the ladies, and was thus the most\r\npopular man in France. Francis I. was at this time making preparations\r\nfor the invasion of Italy, and the Count of Guise, though but eighteen\r\nyears of age, was appointed commander-in-chief of a division of the\r\narmy consisting of twenty thousand men.\r\n\r\nIn all the perils of the bloody battles which soon ensued, he\r\ndisplayed that utter recklessness of danger which had been the\r\ndistinguishing trait of his ancestors. In the first battle, when\r\ndiscomfiture and flight were spreading through his ranks, the proud\r\ncount refused to retire one step before his foes. He was surrounded,\r\novermatched, his horse killed from under him, and he fell, covered\r\nwith twenty-two wounds, in the midst of the piles of mangled bodies\r\nwhich strewed the ground. He was afterward dragged from among the\r\ndead, insensible and apparently lifeless, and conveyed to his tent,\r\nwhere his vigorous constitution, and that energetic vitality which\r\nseemed to characterize his race, triumphed over wounds whose severity\r\nrendered their cure almost miraculous.\r\n\r\nFrancis I., in his report of the battle, extolled in the most glowing\r\nterms the prodigies of valor which Guise had displayed. War,\r\ndesolating war, still ravaged wretched Europe, and Guise, with his\r\nuntiring energy, became so prominent in the court and the camp that he\r\nwas regarded rather as an ally of the King of France than as his\r\nsubject. His enormous fortune, his ancestral renown, the vast\r\npolitical and military influences which were at his command, made him\r\nalmost equal to the monarch whom he served. Francis lavished honors\r\nupon him, converted one of his counties into a dukedom, and, as _duke_\r\nof Guise, young Claude of Lorraine had now attained the highest\r\nposition which a subject could occupy.\r\n\r\nYears of conflagration, carnage, and woe rolled over war-deluged\r\nEurope, during which all the energies of the human race seemed to be\r\nexpended in destruction; and in almost every scene of smouldering\r\ncities, of ravaged valleys, of battle-fields rendered hideous with the\r\nshouts of onset and shrieks of despair, we see the apparition of the\r\nstalwart frame of Guise, scarred, and war-worn, and blackened with the\r\nsmoke and dust of the fray, riding upon his proud charger, wherever\r\nperil was most imminent, as if his body were made of iron.\r\n\r\nAt one time he drove before him, in most bloody rout, a numerous army\r\nof Germans. The fugitives, spreading over leagues of country, fled by\r\nhis own strong castle of Neufchâteau. Antoinette and the ladies of her\r\ncourt stood upon the battlements of the castle, gazing upon the scene,\r\nto them so new and to them so pleasantly exciting. As they saw the\r\ncharges of the cavalry trampling the dead and the dying beneath their\r\nfeet, as they witnessed all the horrors of that most horrible scene\r\nwhich earth can present--a victorious army cutting to pieces its\r\nflying foes, with shouts of applause they animated the ardor of the\r\nvictors. The once fair-faced boy had now become a veteran. His bronzed\r\ncheek and sinewy frame attested his life of hardship and toil. The\r\nnobles were jealous of his power. The king was annoyed by his haughty\r\nbearing; but he was the idol of the people. In one campaign he caused\r\nthe death of forty thousand Protestants, for he was the devoted\r\nservant of mother Church. _Claude the Butcher_ was the not\r\ninappropriate name by which the Protestants designated him. His\r\nbrother John attained the dignity of Cardinal of Lorraine. Claude with\r\nhis keen sword, and John with pomp, and pride, and spiritual power,\r\nbecame the most relentless foes of the Reformation, and the most\r\nvaliant defenders of the Catholic faith.\r\n\r\nThe kind-heartedness of the wealthy but dissolute cardinal, and the\r\nprodigality of his charity, rendered him almost as popular as his\r\nwarlike brother. When he went abroad, his _valet de chambre_\r\ninvariably prepared him a bag filled with gold, from which he gave to\r\nthe poor most freely. His reputation for charity was so exalted that\r\na poor blind mendicant, to whom he gave gold in the streets of Rome,\r\noverjoyed at the acquisition of such a treasure, exclaimed, \"Surely\r\nthou art either Christ or the Cardinal of Lorraine.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Guise, in his advancing years, was accompanied to the\r\nfield of battle by his son Francis, who inherited all of his father's\r\ncourtly bearing, energy, talent, and headlong valor. At the siege of\r\nLuxemburg a musket ball shattered the ankle of young Francis, then\r\nCount of Aumale, and about eighteen years of age. As the surgeon was\r\noperating upon the splintered bones and quivering nerves, the sufferer\r\ngave some slight indication of his sense of pain. His iron father\r\nseverely reprimanded him, saying,\r\n\r\n\"Persons of your rank should not feel their wounds, but, on the\r\ncontrary, should take pleasure in building up their reputation upon\r\nthe ruin of their bodies.\"\r\n\r\nOthers of the sons of Claude also signalized themselves in the wars\r\nwhich then desolated Europe, and they received wealth and honors. The\r\nking erected certain lands and lordships belonging to the Duke of\r\nGuise into a marquisate, and then immediately elevated the marquisate\r\ninto a duchy, and the youngest son of the Duke of Guise, inheriting\r\nthe property, was ennobled with the title of the Duke of Mayence. Thus\r\nthere were two rich dukedoms in the same family.\r\n\r\nClaude had six sons, all young men of imperious spirit and magnificent\r\nbearing. They were allied by marriage with the most illustrious\r\nfamilies in France, several of them being connected with princes of\r\nthe blood royal. The war-worn duke, covered with wounds which he\r\ndeemed his most glorious ornaments, often appeared at court\r\naccompanied by his sons. They occupied the following posts of rank and\r\npower: Francis, the eldest, Count of Aumale, was the heir of the\r\ntitles and the estates of the noble house. Claude was Marquis of\r\nMayence; Charles was Archbishop of Rheims, the richest benefice in\r\nFrance, and he soon attained one of the highest dignities of the\r\nChurch by the reception of a cardinal's hat; Louis was Bishop of\r\nTroyes, and Francis, the youngest, Chevalier of Lorraine and Duke of\r\nMayence, was general of the galleys of France. One of the daughters\r\nwas married to the King of Scotland, and the others had formed most\r\nillustrious connections. Thus the house of Guise towered proudly and\r\nsublimely from among the noble families in the midst of whom it had so\r\nrecently been implanted.\r\n\r\nHenry VIII. of England, inflamed by the report of the exceeding beauty\r\nof Mary, daughter of the Duke of Guise, had solicited her hand; but\r\nClaude was unwilling to surrender his daughter to England's burly and\r\nbrutal old tyrant, and declined the regal alliance. The exasperated\r\nmonarch, in revenge, declared war against France. Years of violence\r\nand blood lingered away. At last Claude, aged and infirm, surrendered\r\nto that king of terrors before whom all must bow. In his strong castle\r\nof Joinville, on the twelfth of April, 1550, the illustrious,\r\nmagnanimous, blood-stained duke, after a whole lifetime spent in\r\nslaughter, breathed his last. His children and his grandchildren were\r\ngathered around the bed of the dying chieftain. In the darkness of\r\nthat age, he felt that he had been contending, with divine approval,\r\nfor Christ and his Church. With prayers and thanksgivings, and\r\nlanguage expressive of meekness and humility before God, he ascended\r\nto that tribunal of final judgment where there is no difference\r\nbetween the peasant and the prince.\r\n\r\nThe chivalrous and warlike Francis inherited his father's titles,\r\nwealth, and power; and now the house of Guise was so influential that\r\nthe king trembled in view of its rivalry. It was but the kingly office\r\nalone which rendered the house of Valois superior to the house of\r\nGuise. In illustration of the character of those times, and the\r\nhardihood and sufferings through which the renown of these chieftains\r\nwas obtained, the following anecdote may be narrated.\r\n\r\nFrancis, Duke of Guise, in one of the skirmishes with the English\r\ninvaders, received a wound which is described as the most severe from\r\nwhich any one ever recovered. The lance of an English officer \"entered\r\nabove the right eye, declining toward the nose, and piercing through\r\non the other side, between the nape and the ear.\" The weapon, having\r\nthus penetrated the head more than half a foot, was broken off by the\r\nviolence of the blow, the lance-iron and two fingers' breadth of the\r\nstaff remaining in the dreadful wound. The surgeons of the army,\r\nstupefied by the magnitude of the injury, declined to attempt the\r\nextraction of the splinter, saying that it would only expose him to\r\ndreadful and unavailing suffering, as he must inevitably die. The king\r\nimmediately sent his surgeon, with orders to spare no possible\r\nefforts to save the life of the hero. The lance-head was broken off so\r\nshort that it was impossible to grasp it with the hand. The surgeon\r\ntook the heavy pincers of a blacksmith, and asked the sufferer if he\r\nwould allow him to make use of so rude an instrument, and would also\r\npermit him to place his foot upon his face.\r\n\r\n\"You may do any thing you consider necessary,\" said the duke.\r\n\r\nThe officers standing around looked on with horror as the king's\r\nsurgeon, aided by an experienced practitioner, tore out thus violently\r\nthe barbed iron, fracturing the bones, and tearing nerves, veins, and\r\narteries. The hardy soldier bore the anguish without the contraction\r\nof a muscle, and was only heard gently to exclaim to himself, \"Oh my\r\nGod!\" The sufferer recovered, and ever after regarded the frightful\r\nscar which was left as a signal badge of honor. He hence bore the\r\ncommon name of Le Balafré, or _The Scarred_.\r\n\r\nAs the duke returned to court, the king hurried forth from his chamber\r\nto meet him, embraced him warmly, and said,\r\n\r\n\"It is fair that I should come out to meet my old friend, who, on his\r\npart, is ever so ready to meet my enemies.\"\r\n\r\nGradually, however, Francis, the king, became very jealous of the\r\nboundless popularity and enormous power acquired by this ambitious\r\nhouse. Upon his dying bed he warned his son of the dangerous rivalry\r\nto which the Guises had attained, and enjoined it upon him to curb\r\ntheir ambition by admitting none of the princes of that house to a\r\nshare in the government; but as soon as King Francis was consigned to\r\nhis tomb, Henry II., his son and successor, rallied the members of\r\nthis family around him, and made the duke almost the partner of his\r\nthrone. He needed the support of the strong arm and of the\r\ninexhaustible purse of the princes of Lorraine.\r\n\r\nThe arrogance of the Guises, or the princes of Lorraine, as they were\r\nfrequently called, in consequence of their descent from Claude of\r\nLorraine, reached such a pitch that on the occasion of a proud\r\npageant, when Henry II. was on a visit of inspection to one of his\r\nfrontier fortresses, the Duke of Guise claimed equal rank with Henry\r\nof Navarre, who was not only King of Navarre, but, as the Duke of\r\nVendôme, was also first prince of the blood in France. An angry\r\ndispute immediately arose. The king settled it in favor of the\r\naudacious Guise, for he was intimidated by the power of that arrogant\r\nhouse. He thus exasperated Henry of Navarre, and also nurtured the\r\npride of a dangerous rival.\r\n\r\nAll classes were now courting the Duke of Guise. The first nobles of\r\nthe land sought his protection and support by flattering letters and\r\ncostly presents. \"From all quarters,\" says an ancient manuscript, \"he\r\nreceived offerings of wine, fruit, confections, ortolans, horses,\r\ndogs, hawks, and gerfalcons. The letters accompanying these often\r\ncontained a second paragraph petitioning for pensions or grants from\r\nthe king, or for places, even down to that of apothecary or of barber\r\nto the Dauphin.\" The monarchs of foreign countries often wrote to him\r\nsoliciting his aid. The duke, in the enjoyment of this immense wealth,\r\ninfluence, and power, assumed the splendors of royalty, and his court\r\nwas hardly inferior to that of the monarch. The King of Poland and the\r\nDuke of Guise were rivals for the hand of Anne, the beautiful daughter\r\nof the Duke of Ferrara, and Guise was the successful suitor.\r\n\r\nFrancis of Lorraine was now appointed lieutenant general of the French\r\narmies, and the king addressed to all the provincial authorities\r\nspecial injunction to render as prompt and absolute obedience to the\r\norders of the Duke of Guise as if they emanated from himself. \"And\r\ntruly,\" says one of the writers of those times, \"never had monarch in\r\nFrance been obeyed more punctually or with greater zeal.\" In fact,\r\nGuise was now the head of the government, and all the great interests\r\nof the nation were ordered by his mind. Henry was a feeble prince,\r\nwith neither vigor of body nor energy of intellect to resist the\r\nencroachments of so imperial a spirit. He gave many indications of\r\nuneasiness in view of his own thralldom, but he was entirely unable to\r\ndispense with the aid of his sagacious ally.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that one of the daughters of Claude, and a\r\nsister of Francis, the second duke of Guise, married the King of\r\nScotland. Her daughter, the niece of Francis, was the celebrated Mary,\r\nQueen of Scots. She had been sent to France for her education, and she\r\nwas married, when very young, to her cousin Francis, son of Henry II.\r\nand of the infamous Catharine de Medici. He was heir of the French\r\nthrone. This wedding was celebrated with the utmost magnificence, and\r\nthe Guises moved on the occasion through the palaces of royalty with\r\nthe pride of monarchs. Henry II. was accidentally killed in a\r\ntournament; and Francis, his son, under the title of Francis II., with\r\nhis young and beautiful bride, the unfortunate Mary, Queen of Scots,\r\nascended the throne. Francis was a feeble-minded, consumptive youth of\r\n16, whose thoughts were all centred in his lovely wife. Mary, who was\r\nbut fifteen years of age, was fascinating in the extreme, and entirely\r\ndevoted to pleasure. She gladly transferred all the power of the realm\r\nto her uncles, the Guises.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the conflict between the Catholics and the Protestants\r\nbegan to grow more violent. The Catholics drew the sword for the\r\nextirpation of heresy; the Protestants grasped their arms to defend\r\nthemselves. The Guises consecrated all their energies to the support\r\nof the Papal Church and to the suppression of the Reformation. The\r\nfeeble boy, Francis II., sat languidly upon his throne but seventeen\r\nmonths, when he died, on the 5th of December, 1560, and his brother,\r\nCharles IX., equally enervated in mind and with far less moral worth,\r\nsucceeded to the crown. The death of Francis II. was a heavy blow to\r\nthe Guises. The Admiral Coligni, one of the most illustrious of the\r\nProtestants, and the bosom friend of Henry of Navarre, was standing,\r\nwith many other nobles, at the bedside of the monarch as he breathed\r\nhis last.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the admiral, with that gravity which was in\r\naccordance with his character and his religious principles, \"the king\r\nis dead. It is a lesson to teach us all how to live.\"\r\n\r\nThe Protestants could not but rejoice that the Guises had thus lost\r\nthe peculiar influence which they had secured from their near\r\nrelationship to the queen. Admiral Coligni retired from the death-bed\r\nof the monarch to his own mansion, and, sitting down by the fire,\r\nbecame lost in the most profound reverie. He did not observe that his\r\nboots were burning until one of his friends called his attention to\r\nthe fact.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" he replied, \"not a week ago, you and I would each have given a\r\nleg to have things take this turn, and now we get off with a pair of\r\nboots.\"\r\n\r\nAntoinette, the widow of Claude of Lorraine, and the mother of\r\nFrancis, the then Duke of Guise, was still living. She was so\r\nrancorous in her hostility to the Protestants that she was designated\r\nby them \"_Mother of the tyrants and enemies of the Gospel_.\" Greatly\r\nto her annoyance, a large number of Protestants conducted their\r\nworship in the little town of Vassy, just on the frontier of the\r\ndomains of the Duke of Guise. She was incessantly imploring her son to\r\ndrive off these obnoxious neighbors. The duke was at one time\r\njourneying with his wife. Their route lay through the town of Vassy.\r\nHis suite consisted of two hundred and sixty men at arms, all showing\r\nthe warlike temper of their chief, and even far surpassing him in\r\nbigoted hatred of the Protestants.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Vassy, the duke entered the church to hear high mass.\r\nIt is said that while engaged in this act of devotion his ears were\r\nannoyed by the psalms of the Protestants, who were assembled in the\r\nvicinity. He sent an imperious message for the minister and the\r\nleading members of the congregation immediately to appear before him.\r\nThe young men fulfilled their mission in a manner so taunting and\r\ninsulting that a quarrel ensued, shots were exchanged, and immediately\r\nall the vassals of the duke, who were ripe for a fray, commenced an\r\nindiscriminate massacre. The Protestants valiantly but unavailingly\r\ndefended themselves with sticks and stones; but the bullets of their\r\nenemies reached them everywhere, in the houses, on the roofs, in the\r\nstreets. For an hour the carnage continued unchecked, and sixty men\r\nand women were killed and two hundred wounded. One only of the men of\r\nthe duke was killed. Francis was ashamed of this slaughter of the\r\ndefenseless, and declared that it was a sudden outbreak, for which he\r\nwas not responsible, and which he had done every thing in his power to\r\ncheck; but ever after this he was called by the Protestants \"_The\r\nButcher of Vassy_.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the news of this massacre reached Paris, Theodore de Beza was\r\ndeputed by the Protestants to demand of Catharine, their regent,\r\nsevere justice on the Duke of Guise; but Catharine feared the princes\r\nof Lorraine, and said to Beza,\r\n\r\n\"Whoever touches so much as the finger-tip of the Duke of Guise,\r\ntouches me in the middle of my heart.\"\r\n\r\nBeza meekly but courageously replied, \"It assuredly behooves that\r\nChurch of God, in whose name I speak, to endure blows and not to\r\nstrike them; but may it please your majesty also to remember that it\r\nis an anvil which has worn out many hammers.\"\r\n\r\nAt the siege of Rouen the Duke of Guise was informed that an assassin\r\nhad been arrested who had entered the camp with the intention of\r\ntaking his life. He ordered the man to be brought before him, and\r\ncalmly inquired,\r\n\r\n\"Have you not come hither to kill me?\"\r\n\r\nThe intrepid but misguided young man openly avowed his intention.\r\n\r\n\"And what motive,\" inquired the duke, \"impelled you to such a deed?\r\nHave I done you any wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he replied; \"but in removing you from the world I should promote\r\nthe best interests of the Protestant religion, which I profess.\"\r\n\r\n\"My religion, then,\" generously replied the duke, \"is better than\r\nyours, for it commands me to pardon, of my own accord, you who are\r\nconvicted of guilt.\" And, by his orders, the assassin was safely\r\nconducted out of camp.\r\n\r\n\"A fine example,\" exclaims his historian, \"of truly religious\r\nsentiments and magnanimous proselytism very natural to the Duke of\r\nGuise, the most moderate and humane of the chiefs of the Catholic\r\narmy, and whose brilliant generosity had been but temporarily obscured\r\nby the occurrence at Vassy.\"\r\n\r\nThe war between the Catholics and Protestants was now raging with\r\nimplacable fury, and Guise, victorious in many battles, had acquired\r\nfrom the Catholic party the name of \"Savior of his Country.\" The duke\r\nwas now upon the very loftiest summits of power which a subject can\r\nattain. In great exaltation of spirits, he one morning left the army\r\nover which he was commander-in-chief to visit the duchess, who had\r\ncome to meet him at the neighboring castle of Corney. The duke very\r\nimprudently took with him merely one general officer and a page. It\r\nwas a beautiful morning in February. As he crossed, in a boat, the\r\nmirrored surface of the Loiret, the vegetation of returning spring and\r\nthe songs of the rejoicing birds strikingly contrasted with the blood,\r\ndesolation, and misery with which the hateful spirit of war was\r\ndesolating France. The duke was silent, apparently lost in painful\r\nreveries. His companions disturbed not his thoughts. Having crossed\r\nthe stream, he was slowly walking his horse, with the reins hanging\r\nlistlessly upon his mane, when a pistol was discharged at him from\r\nbehind a hedge, at a distance of but six or seven paces. Two bullets\r\npierced his side. On feeling himself wounded, he calmly said,\r\n\r\n\"They have long had this shot in reserve for me. I deserve it for my\r\nwant of precaution.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ASSASSINATION OF FRANCIS, DUKE OF GUISE.]\r\n\r\nHe immediately fell upon his horse's neck, and was caught in the arms\r\nof his friends. They conveyed him to the castle, where the duchess\r\nreceived him with cries of anguish. He embraced her tenderly,\r\nminutely described the circumstances of his assassination, and\r\nexpressed himself grieved in view of the stain which such a crime\r\nwould inflict upon the honor of France. He exhorted his wife to bow in\r\nsubmission to the will of Heaven, and kissing his son Henry, the Duke\r\nof Joinville, who was weeping by his side, gently said to him,\r\n\r\n\"God grant thee grace, my son, to be a good man.\"\r\n\r\nThus died Francis, the second Duke of Guise, on the twenty-fourth of\r\nFebruary, 1563. His murderer was a young Protestant noble, Jean\r\nPoltrot, twenty-four years of age. Poltrot, from being an ardent\r\nCatholic, had embraced the Protestant faith. This exposed him to\r\npersecution, and he was driven from France with the loss of his\r\nestates. He was compelled to support himself by manual labor. Soured\r\nin disposition, exasperated and half maddened, he insanely felt that\r\nhe would be doing God service by the assassination of the _Butcher of\r\nVassy_, the most formidable foe of the Protestant religion. It was a\r\nday of general darkness, and of the confusion of all correct ideas of\r\nmorals.\r\n\r\nHenry, the eldest son of the Duke of Guise, a lad of but thirteen\r\nyears of age, now inherited the titles and the renown which his bold\r\nancestors had accumulated. This was the Duke of Guise who was the\r\nbandit chieftain in the Massacre of St. Bartholomew.\r\n\r\nOne day Henry II. was holding his little daughter Marguerite, who\r\nafterward became the wife of Henry of Navarre, in his lap, when Henry\r\nof Guise, then Prince of Joinville, and the Marquis of Beaupreau, were\r\nplaying together upon the floor, the one being but seven years of age,\r\nand the other but nine.\r\n\r\n\"Which of the two do you like the best?\" inquired the king of his\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n\"I prefer the marquis,\" she promptly replied.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but the Prince of Joinville is the handsomest,\" the king\r\nrejoined.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" retorted Marguerite, \"he is always in mischief, and he will be\r\nmaster every where.\"\r\n\r\nFrancis, the Duke of Guise, had fully apprehended the ambitious,\r\nimpetuous, and reckless character of his son. He is said to have\r\npredicted that Henry, intoxicated by popularity, would perish in the\r\nattempt to seat himself upon the throne of France.\r\n\r\n\"Henry,\" says a writer of those times, \"surpassed all the princes of\r\nhis house in certain natural gifts, in certain talents, which procured\r\nhim the respect of the court, the affection of the people, but which,\r\nnevertheless, were tarnished by a singular alloy of great faults and\r\nunlimited ambition.\"\r\n\r\n\"France was mad about that man,\" writes another, \"for it is too little\r\nto say that she was in love with him. Her passion approached idolatry.\r\nThere were persons who invoked him in their prayers. His portrait was\r\nevery where. Some ran after him in the streets to touch his mantle\r\nwith their rosaries. One day that he entered Paris on his return from\r\na journey, the multitude not only cried '_Vive Guise!_' but many sang,\r\non his passage, '_Hosanna to the son of David!_'\"\r\n\r\n3. _The House of Bourbon._ The origin of this family fades away in the\r\nremoteness of antiquity. Some bold chieftain, far remote in barbarian\r\nages, emerged from obscurity and laid the foundations of the\r\nillustrious house. Generation after generation passed away, as the son\r\nsucceeded the father in baronial pomp, and pride, and power, till the\r\nlight of history, with its steadily-increasing brilliancy, illumined\r\nEurope. The family had often been connected in marriage both with the\r\nhouse of Guise and the royal line, the house of Valois. Antony of\r\nBourbon, a sturdy soldier, united the houses of Bourbon and Navarre\r\nby marrying Jeanne d'Albret, the only child of the King of Navarre.\r\nHenry came from the union, an only son; and he, by marrying\r\nMarguerite, the daughter of the King of France, united the houses of\r\nBourbon, Navarre, and Valois, and became heir to the throne of France\r\nshould the sons of Henry II. die without issue.\r\n\r\nThis episode in reference to the condition of France at the time of\r\nwhich we write seems necessary to enable the reader fully to\r\nunderstand the succeeding chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE DEATH OF CHARLES IX.

For seven\r\nmonths they were besieged by all the power which the King of France\r\ncould bring against them. They were at length, weakened by sickness\r\nand exhausted by famine, compelled to surrender. By their valiant\r\nresistance, however, they obtained highly honorable terms, securing\r\nfor the inhabitants of Rochelle the free exercise of their religion\r\nwithin the walls of the city, and a general act of amnesty for all the\r\nProtestants in the realm.\r\n\r\nImmediately after this event, Henry, the brother of Charles IX., was\r\nelected King of Poland, an honor which he attained in consequence of\r\nthe military prowess he had displayed in the wars against the\r\nProtestants of France. Accompanied by his mother, Catharine de Medici,\r\nthe young monarch set out for his distant dominions. Henry had been a\r\nvery active agent in the Massacre of St. Bartholomew. At Lorraine\r\nCatharine took leave of him, and he went on his way in a very\r\nmelancholy mood. His election had been secured by the greatest efforts\r\nof intrigue and bribery on the part of his mother. The melancholy\r\ncountenances of the Protestants, driven into exile, and bewailing the\r\nmurder of friends and relatives, whose assassination he had caused,\r\nmet him at every turn. His reception at the German courts was cold and\r\nrepulsive. In the palace of the Elector Palatine, Henry beheld the\r\nportrait of Coligni, who had been so treacherously slaughtered in the\r\nMassacre of St. Bartholomew. The portrait was suspended in a very\r\nconspicuous place of honor, and beneath it were inscribed the words,\r\n\r\n     \"SUCH WAS THE FORMER COUNTENANCE OF THE HERO COLIGNI, WHO\r\n     HAS BEEN RENDERED TRULY ILLUSTRIOUS BOTH BY HIS LIFE AND HIS\r\n     DEATH.\"\r\n\r\nThe Protestant Elector pointed out the picture to the young king, whom\r\nhe both hated and despised, and coolly asked him if he knew the man.\r\nHenry, not a little embarrassed, replied that he did.\r\n\r\n\"He was,\" rejoined the German prince, \"the most honest man, and the\r\nwisest and the greatest captain of Europe, whose children I keep with\r\nme, lest the dogs of France should tear them as their father has been\r\ntorn.\"\r\n\r\nThus Henry, gloomy through the repulses which he was ever\r\nencountering, journeyed along to Poland, where he was crowned king,\r\nnotwithstanding energetic remonstrances on the part of those who\r\nexecrated him for his deeds. The two brothers, Charles IX. and Henry,\r\nwere bitter enemies, and Charles had declared, with many oaths, that\r\none of the two should leave the realm. Henry was the favorite of\r\nCatharine, and hence she made such efforts to secure his safety by\r\nplacing him upon the throne of Poland. She was aware that the feeble\r\nCharles would not live long, and when, with tears, she took leave of\r\nHenry, she assured him that he would soon return.\r\n\r\nThe outcry of indignation which the Massacre of St. Bartholomew called\r\nforth from combined Europe fell like the knell of death on the ear of\r\nthe depraved and cowardly Charles. Disease began to ravage, with new\r\nviolence, his exhausted frame. He became silent, morose, irritable,\r\nand gloomy. He secluded himself from all society, and surrendered\r\nhimself to the dominion of remorse. He was detested by the\r\nProtestants, and utterly despised by the Catholics. A bloody sweat,\r\noozing from every pore, crimsoned his bed-clothes. His occasional\r\noutcries of remorse and his aspect of misery drove all from his\r\nchamber excepting those who were compelled to render him service. He\r\ngroaned and wept incessantly, exclaiming,\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what blood! oh, what murders! Alas! why did I follow such evil\r\ncounsels?\"\r\n\r\nHe saw continually the spectres of the slain, with ghastly, gory\r\nwounds, stalking about his bed; and demons of hideous aspect, and with\r\nweapons of torture in their hands, with horrid and derisive malice,\r\nwere impatiently waiting to seize his soul the moment it should pass\r\nfrom the decaying body.\r\n\r\nThe day before his death he lay for some time upon his bed in perfect\r\nsilence. Suddenly starting up, he exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"Call my brother.\"\r\n\r\nHis mother, who was sitting by his side, directed an attendant to call\r\nhis brother Francis, the Duke of Alençon.\r\n\r\n\"No, not him,\" the king replied; \"my brother, the King of Navarre, I\r\nmean.\"\r\n\r\nHenry of Navarre was then detained in princely imprisonment in the\r\ncourt of Catharine. He had made many efforts to escape, but all had\r\nbeen unavailing.\r\n\r\nCatharine directed that Henry should be called. In order to intimidate\r\nhim, and thus to prevent him from speaking with freedom and boldness\r\nto her dying son, she ordered him to be brought through the vaults of\r\nthe castle, between a double line of armed guards. Henry, as he\r\ndescended into those gloomy dungeons, and saw the glittering arms of\r\nthe soldiers, felt that the hour for his assassination had arrived.\r\nHe, however, passed safely through, and was ushered into the chamber\r\nof his brother-in-law and former playfellow, the dying king. Charles\r\nIX., subdued by remorse and appalled by approaching death, received\r\nhim with gentleness and affection, and weeping profusely, embraced him\r\nas he knelt by his bedside.\r\n\r\n\"My brother,\" said the dying king, \"you lose a good master and a good\r\nfriend. I know that you are not the cause of the troubles which have\r\ncome upon me. If I had believed all which has been told me, you would\r\nnot now have been living; but I have always loved you.\" Then turning\r\nhis eyes to the queen mother, he said energetically, \"Do not trust\r\nto--\" Here Catharine hastily interrupted him, and prevented the\r\nfinishing of the sentence with the words \"_my mother_.\"\r\n\r\nCharles designated his brother Henry, the King of Poland, as his\r\nsuccessor. He expressed the earnest wish that neither his younger\r\nbrother, Francis, the Duke of Alençon, nor Henry, would disturb the\r\nrepose of the realm. The next night, as the Cathedral clock was\r\ntolling the hour of twelve, the nurse, who was sitting, with two\r\nwatchers, at the bedside of the dying monarch, heard him sighing and\r\nmoaning, and then convulsively weeping. Gently she approached the bed\r\nand drew aside the curtains. Charles turned his dimmed and despairing\r\neye upon her, and exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my nurse! my nurse! what blood have I shed! what murders have I\r\ncommitted! Great God! pardon me--pardon me!\"\r\n\r\nA convulsive shuddering for a moment agitated his frame, his head fell\r\nback upon his pillow, and the wretched man was dead. He died at\r\ntwenty-four years of age, expressing satisfaction that he left no heir\r\nto live and to suffer in a world so full of misery. In reference to\r\nthis guilty king, Chateaubriand says,\r\n\r\n\"Should we not have some pity for this monarch of twenty-three years,\r\nborn with fine talents, a taste for literature and the arts, a\r\ncharacter naturally generous, whom an execrable mother had tried to\r\ndeprave by all the abuses of debauchery and power?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" warmly responds G. de Felice, \"we will have compassion for him,\r\nwith the Huguenots themselves, whose fathers he ordered to be slain,\r\nand who, with a merciful hand, would wipe away the blood which covers\r\nhis face to find still something human.\"\r\n\r\nHenry, his brother, who was to succeed him upon the throne, was then\r\nin Poland. Catharine was glad to have the pusillanimous Charles out of\r\nthe way. He was sufficiently depraved to commit any crime, without\r\nbeing sufficiently resolute to brave its penalty. Henry III. had, in\r\nearly life, displayed great vigor of character. At the age of fifteen\r\nhe had been placed in the command of armies, and in several combats\r\nhad defeated the veteran generals of the Protestant forces. His renown\r\nhad extended through Europe, and had contributed much in placing him\r\non the elective throne of Poland. Catharine, by the will of the king,\r\nwas appointed regent until the return of Henry. She immediately\r\ndispatched messengers to recall the King of Poland. In the mean time,\r\nshe kept Henry of Navarre and her youngest son, the Duke of Alençon,\r\nin close captivity, and watched them with the greatest vigilance, that\r\nthey might make no movements toward the throne.\r\n\r\nHenry was by this time utterly weary of his Polish crown, and sighed\r\nfor the voluptuous pleasures of Paris. The Poles were not willing that\r\ntheir king should leave the realm, as it might lead to civil war in\r\nthe choice of a successor. Henry was compelled to resort to stratagem\r\nto effect his escape. A large and splendid party was invited to the\r\npalace. A wilderness of rooms, brilliantly illuminated, were thrown\r\nopen to the guests. Masked dancers walked the floor in every variety\r\nof costume. Wine and wassail filled the halls with revelry. When all\r\nwere absorbed in music and mirth, the king, by a private passage,\r\nstole from the palace, and mounting a swift horse, which was awaiting\r\nhim in the court-yard, accompanied by two or three friends, commenced\r\nhis flight from his crown and his Polish throne. Through the long\r\nhours of the night they pressed their horses to their utmost speed,\r\nand when the morning dawned, obtaining fresh steeds, they hurried on\r\ntheir way, tarrying not for refreshment or repose until they had\r\npassed the frontiers of the kingdom. Henry was afraid to take the\r\ndirect route through the Protestant states of Germany, for the\r\nMassacre of St. Bartholomew was still bitterly remembered. He\r\ntherefore took a circuitous route through Italy, and arrived at Venice\r\nin August. In sunny Italy he lingered for some time, surrendering\r\nhimself to every enervating indulgence, and even bartering the\r\nfortresses of France to purchase the luxuries in the midst of which he\r\nwas reveling. At last, sated with guilty pleasure, he languidly turned\r\nhis steps toward Paris.\r\n\r\nThere were now three Henrys, who had been companions in childhood, who\r\nwere at the head of the three rival houses of Valois, of Bourbon, and\r\nof Guise. One of these was King of France. One was King of Navarre.\r\nBut Henry of Guise was, in wealth and in the attachment of the\r\nCatholic population of France, superior to either. The war which\r\nensued is sometimes called _The War of the three Henrys_.\r\n\r\nAs soon as his mother learned that he was approaching France, she set\r\nout from Paris with a magnificent retinue to meet her pet child,\r\ntaking with her his brother, the Duke of Alençon, and Henry of\r\nNavarre. Dissipation had impaired the mental as well as the physical\r\nenergies of the king, and a maudlin good-nature had absorbed all his\r\nfaculties. He greeted his brother and his brother-in-law with much\r\nkindness, and upon receiving their oaths of obedience, withdrew much\r\nof the restraint to which they previously had been subjected. Henry\r\nwas now known as Henry III. of France. Soon after his coronation he\r\nmarried Louisa of Lorraine, a daughter of one of the sons of the Duke\r\nof Guise. She was a pure-minded and lovely woman, and her mild and\r\ngentle virtues contrasted strongly with the vulgarity, coarseness, and\r\nvice of her degraded husband.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Alençon was, however, by no means appeased by the kindness\r\nwith which he had been received by his brother the king. He called him\r\nthe robber of his crown, and formed a conspiracy for attacking the\r\ncarriage of his brother and putting him to death. The plot was\r\nrevealed to the king. He called his brother to his presence,\r\nreproached him with his perfidy and ingratitude, but generously\r\nforgave him. But the heart of Alençon was impervious to any appeals of\r\ngenerosity or of honor. Upon the death of Henry III., the Duke of\r\nAlençon, his only surviving brother, would ascend the throne.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Guise hated with implacable rancor the Duke of Alençon,\r\nand even proffered his aid to place Henry of Navarre upon the throne\r\nin the event of the death of the king, that he might thus exclude his\r\ndetested rival. Francis, the Duke of Alençon, was impatient to reach\r\nthe crown, and again formed a plot to poison his brother. The king was\r\nsuddenly taken very ill. He declared his brother had poisoned him. As\r\neach succeeding day his illness grew more severe, and the\r\nprobabilities became stronger of its fatal termination, Francis\r\nassumed an air of haughtiness and of authority, as if confident that\r\nthe crown was already his own. The open exultation which he manifested\r\nin view of the apparently dying condition of his brother Henry\r\nconfirmed all in the suspicion that he had caused poison to be\r\nadministered.\r\n\r\nHenry III., believing his death inevitable, called Henry of Navarre to\r\nhis bedside, and heaping the bitterest invectives upon his brother\r\nFrancis, urged Henry of Navarre to procure his assassination, and thus\r\nsecure for himself the vacant throne. Henry of Navarre was the next\r\nheir to the throne after the Duke of Alençon, and the dying king most\r\nearnestly urged Henry to put the duke to death, showing him the ease\r\nwith which it could be done, and assuring him that he would be\r\nabundantly supported by all the leading nobles of the kingdom. While\r\nthis scene was taking place at the sick-bed of the monarch, Francis\r\npassed through the chamber of his brother without deigning to notice\r\neither him or the King of Navarre. Strongly as Henry of Navarre was\r\ndesirous of securing for himself the throne of France, he was utterly\r\nincapable of meditating even upon such a crime, and he refused to give\r\nit a second thought.\r\n\r\nTo the surprise of all, the king recovered, and Francis made no\r\nefforts to conceal his disappointment. There were thousands of armed\r\ninsurgents ready at any moment to rally around the banner of the Duke\r\nof Alençon, for they would thus be brought into positions of emolument\r\nand power. The king, who was ready himself to act the assassin,\r\ntreated his assassin-brother with the most profound contempt. No\r\ndescription can convey an adequate idea of the state of France at this\r\ntime. Universal anarchy prevailed. Civil war, exasperated by the\r\nutmost rancor, was raging in nearly all the provinces. Assassinations\r\nwere continually occurring. Female virtue was almost unknown, and the\r\nmost shameful licentiousness filled the capital. The treasury was so\r\nutterly exhausted that, in a journey made by the king and his retinue\r\nin mid-winter, the pages were obliged to sell their cloaks to obtain a\r\nbare subsistence. The king, steeped in pollution, a fanatic and a\r\nhypocrite, exhibited himself to his subjects bareheaded, barefooted,\r\nand half naked, scourging himself with a whip, reciting his prayers,\r\nand preparing the way, by the most ostentatious penances, to plunge\r\nanew into every degrading sensual indulgence. He was thoroughly\r\ndespised by his subjects, and many were anxious to exchange him for\r\nthe reckless and impetuous, but equally depraved Francis.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the Duke of Alençon was now not only very\r\nuncomfortable, but exceedingly perilous. The king did every thing in\r\nhis power to expose him to humiliations, and was evidently watching\r\nfor an opportunity to put him to death, either by the dagger or by a\r\ncup of poison. The duke, aided by his profligate sister Marguerite,\r\nwife of Henry of Navarre, formed a plan for escape.\r\n\r\nOne dark evening he wrapped himself in a large cloak, and issued forth\r\nalone from the Louvre. Passing through obscure streets, he arrived at\r\nthe suburbs of the city, where a carriage with trusty attendants was\r\nin waiting. Driving as rapidly as possible, he gained the open\r\ncountry, and then mounting a very fleet charger, which by previous\r\nappointment was provided for him, he spurred his horse at the utmost\r\nspeed for many leagues, till he met an escort of three hundred men,\r\nwith whom he took refuge in a fortified town. His escape was not known\r\nin the palace until nine o'clock the next morning. Henry was\r\nexceedingly agitated when he received the tidings, for he knew that\r\nhis energetic and reckless brother would join the Protestant party,\r\ncarrying with him powerful influence, and thus add immeasurably to the\r\ndistractions which now crowded upon the king.\r\n\r\nFor once, imminent peril roused Henry III. to vigorous action. He\r\nforgot his spaniels, his parrots, his monkeys, and even his painted\r\nconcubines, and roused himself to circumvent the plans of his hated\r\nrival. Letter after letter was sent to all the provinces, informing\r\nthe governors of the flight of the prince, and commanding the most\r\nvigorous efforts to secure his arrest. Francis issued a proclamation\r\ndeclaring the reasons for his escape, and calling upon the Protestants\r\nand all who loved the \"public good\" to rally around him. Hence the\r\nshort but merciless war which ensued was called \"the war of the public\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Alençon was now at the head of a powerful party, for he\r\nhad thrown himself into the arms of the Protestants, and many of his\r\nCatholic partisans followed him. Henry III. called to his aid the\r\nfearless and energetic Duke of Guise, and gave him the command of his\r\narmies. In the first terrible conflict which ensued Guise was\r\ndefeated, and received a hideous gash upon his face, which left a scar\r\nof which he was very proud as a signet of valor.\r\n\r\nCatharine was now in deep trouble. Her two sons were in open arms\r\nagainst each other, heading powerful forces, and sweeping France with\r\nwhirlwinds of destruction. Henry of Navarre was still detained a\r\nprisoner in the French court, though surrounded by all the luxuries\r\nand indulgences of the capital. The dignity of his character, and his\r\ngreat popularity, alarmed Catharine, lest, in the turmoil of the\r\ntimes, he should thrust both of her sons from the throne, and grasp\r\nthe crown himself. Henry and his friends all became fully convinced\r\nthat Catharine entertained designs upon his life. Marguerite was fully\r\nsatisfied that it was so, and, bad as she was, as Henry interfered not\r\nin the slightest degree with any of her practices, she felt a certain\r\nkind of regard for him. The guards who had been assigned to Henry\r\nprofessedly as a mark of honor, and to add to the splendor of his\r\nestablishment, were in reality his jailers, who watched him with an\r\neagle eye. They were all zealous Papists, and most of them, in the\r\nMassacre of St. Bartholomew, had dipped their hands deep in Protestant\r\nblood. Catharine watched him with unceasing vigilance, and crowded\r\nevery temptation upon him which could enervate and ruin. Her depravity\r\ndid but stimulate her woman's shrewdness and tact.\r\n\r\nHenry of Navarre sighed for liberty. He was, however, so closely\r\nguarded that escape seemed impossible. At last the following plan was\r\nformed for flight. A hunting-party was got up. Henry was to invite\r\npersons to attend the chase in whose fidelity he could repose\r\nconfidence, while one only was to be intrusted with the secret. Others\r\nof his friends were secretly to resort to an appointed rendezvous with\r\nfresh horses, and all well armed and in sufficient numbers to\r\noverpower the guard placed about his person. Henry was to press on in\r\nthe chase with the utmost eagerness until the horses of the guard were\r\ncompletely exhausted, when his friends with the fresh steeds were to\r\nappear, rescue him from the guards, and accompany him in his flight.\r\nThe guards, being drawn far from the palace, could not speedily obtain\r\nfresh horses, neither could they pursue him with their jaded animals.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Guise was now in great favor with Henry III. Henry of\r\nNavarre, during the few days in which he was making preparation for\r\nhis flight, blinded the eagle eyes of the duke by affecting great\r\nconfidence that he should obtain from the king the high office of\r\nlieutenant general of France. The duke and Henry III. made themselves\r\nvery merry over this supposed simplicity of Henry of Navarre, little\r\naware that he was making himself equally merry at their expense.\r\n\r\nTwo days before the execution of the scheme, a rumor spread through\r\nthe court that Henry had escaped. For a short time great anxiety and\r\nconfusion ensued. Henry, being informed of the report and of the\r\nagitation which filled the palace, hastened to the apartments where\r\nCatharine and the king were in deliberation, and laughingly told them\r\nthat he had arrested the King of Navarre, and that he now surrendered\r\nhim to them for safe keeping.\r\n\r\nIn the morning of the day fixed for his flight, the King of Navarre\r\nheld a long and familiar conversation with the Duke of Guise, and\r\nurged him to accompany him to the hunt. Just as the moment arrived for\r\nthe execution of the plot, it was betrayed to the king by the\r\ntreachery of a confederate. Notwithstanding this betrayal, however,\r\nmatters were so thoroughly arranged that Henry, after several\r\nhair-breadth escapes from arrest, accomplished his flight. His\r\napprehension was so great that for sixty miles he rode as rapidly as\r\npossible, without speaking a word or stopping for one moment except to\r\nmount a fresh horse. He rode over a hundred miles on horseback that\r\nday, and took refuge in Alençon, a fortified city held by the\r\nProtestants. As soon as his escape was known, thousands of his friends\r\nflocked around him.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Alençon was not a little troubled at the escape of the\r\nKing of Navarre, for he was well aware that the authority he had\r\nacquired among the Protestants would be lost by the presence of one so\r\nmuch his superior in every respect, and so much more entitled to the\r\nconfidence of the Protestants. Thus the two princes remained separate,\r\nbut ready, in case of emergence, to unite their forces, which now\r\namounted to fifty thousand men. Henry of Navarre soon established his\r\nhead-quarters on the banks of the Loire, where every day fresh\r\nparties of Protestants were joining his standard.\r\n\r\nHenry III., with no energy of character, despised by his subjects, and\r\nwithout either money or armies, seemed to be now entirely at the mercy\r\nof the confederate princes. Henry of Navarre and the Duke of Alençon\r\nsent an embassador to the French court to propose terms to Henry III.\r\nThe King of Navarre required, among other conditions, that France\r\nshould unite with him in recovering from Spain that portion of the\r\nterritory of Navarre which had been wrested from his ancestors by\r\nFerdinand and Isabella. While the proposed conditions of peace were\r\nunder discussion, Catharine succeeded in bribing her son, the Duke of\r\nAlençon, to abandon the cause of Henry of Navarre. A treaty of peace\r\nwas then concluded with the Protestants; and by a royal edict, the\r\nfull and free exercise of the Protestant religion was guaranteed in\r\nevery part of France except Paris and a circle twelve miles in\r\ndiameter around the capital. As a bribe to the Duke of Alençon, he was\r\ninvested with sovereign power over the three most important provinces\r\nof the realm, with an annual income of one hundred thousand crowns.\r\nThis celebrated treaty, called the _Paix de Monsieur_, because\r\nconcluded under the auspices of Francis, the brother of the king, was\r\nsigned at Chastenoy the sixth of May, 1576.\r\n\r\nThe ambitious and perfidious duke now assumed the title of the Duke of\r\nAnjou, and entirely separated himself from the Protestants. He tried\r\nto lure the Prince of Condé, the cousin and devoted friend of Henry of\r\nNavarre, to accompany him into the town of Bourges. The prince,\r\nsuspecting treachery, refused the invitation, saying that some rogue\r\nwould probably be found in the city who would send a bullet through\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n\"The rogue would be hanged, I know,\" he added, \"but the Prince of\r\nCondé would be dead. I will not give you occasion, my lord, to hang\r\nrogues for love of me.\"\r\n\r\nHe accordingly took his leave of the Duke of Alençon, and, putting\r\nspurs to his horse, with fifty followers joined the King of Navarre.\r\n\r\nHenry was received with royal honors in the Protestant town of\r\nRochelle, where he publicly renounced the Roman Catholic faith,\r\ndeclaring that he had assented to that faith from compulsion, and as\r\nthe only means of saving his life. He also publicly performed penance\r\nfor the sin which he declared that he had thus been compelled to\r\ncommit.\r\n\r\nCatharine and Henry III., having detached Francis, who had been the\r\nDuke of Alençon, but who was now the Duke of Anjou, from the\r\nProtestants, no longer feigned any friendship or even toleration for\r\nthat cause. They acted upon the principle that no faith was to be kept\r\nwith heretics. The Protestants, notwithstanding the treaty, were\r\nexposed to every species of insult and injury. The Catholics were\r\ndetermined that the Protestant religion should not be tolerated in\r\nFrance, and that all who did not conform to the Church of Rome should\r\neither perish or be driven from the kingdom. Many of the Protestants\r\nwere men of devoted piety, who cherished their religious convictions\r\nmore tenaciously than life. There were others, however, who joined\r\nthem merely from motives of political ambition. Though the Protestant\r\nparty, in France itself, was comparatively small, the great mass of\r\nthe population being Catholics, yet the party was extremely\r\ninfluential from the intelligence and the rank of its leaders, and\r\nfrom the unconquerable energy with which all of its members were\r\nanimated.\r\n\r\nThe weak and irresolute king was ever vacillating between the two\r\nparties. The Duke of Guise was the great idol of the Catholics. Henry\r\nof Navarre was the acknowledged leader of the Protestants. The king\r\nfeared them both. It was very apparent that Henry III. could not live\r\nlong. At his death his brother Francis, Duke of Anjou, would ascend\r\nthe throne. Should he die childless, Henry of Navarre would be his\r\nlawful successor. But the Catholics would be horror-stricken at the\r\nidea of seeing a _heretic_ on the throne. The Duke of Guise was laying\r\nhis plans deep and broad to array all the Catholic population of\r\nFrance in his own favor, and thus to rob the Protestant prince of his\r\nrights. Henry III., Henry of Navarre, Henry, Duke of Guise, and\r\nFrancis, Duke of Anjou, had all been playmates in childhood and\r\nclassmates at school. They were now heading armies, and struggling for\r\nthe prize of the richest crown in Europe.\r\n\r\nFrancis was weary of waiting for his brother to die. To strengthen\r\nhimself, he sought in marriage the hand of Queen Elizabeth of England.\r\nThough she had no disposition to receive a husband, she was ever very\r\nhappy to be surrounded by lovers. She consequently played the coquette\r\nwith Francis until he saw that there was no probability of the\r\nsuccessful termination of his suit. Francis returned to Paris\r\nbitterly disappointed, and with new zeal consecrated his sword to the\r\ncause of the Catholics. Had Elizabeth accepted his suit, he would then\r\nmost earnestly have espoused the cause of the Protestants.\r\n\r\nHenry III. now determined to make a vigorous effort to crush the\r\nProtestant religion. He raised large armies, and gave the command to\r\nthe Duke of Anjou, the Duke of Guise, and to the brother of the Duke\r\nof Guise, the Duke of Mayenne. Henry of Navarre, encountering fearful\r\nodds, was welcomed by acclamation to head the small but indomitable\r\nband of Protestants, now struggling, not for liberty only, but for\r\nlife. The king was very anxious to get Henry of Navarre again in his\r\npower, and sent most flattering messages and most pressing invitations\r\nto lure him again to his court; but years of captivity had taught a\r\nlesson of caution not soon to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nAgain hideous war ravaged France. The Duke of Anjou, exasperated by\r\ndisappointed love, disgraced himself by the most atrocious cruelties.\r\nHe burned the dwellings of the Protestants, surrendered unarmed and\r\ndefenseless men, and women, and children to massacre. The Duke of\r\nGuise, who had inflicted such an ineffaceable stain upon his\r\nreputation by the foul murder of the Admiral Coligni, made some\r\natonement for this shameful act by the chivalrous spirit with which he\r\nendeavored to mitigate the horrors of civil war.\r\n\r\nOne day, in the vicinity of Bayonne, a party of Catholics, consisting\r\nof a few hundred horse and foot, were conducting to their execution\r\nthree Protestant young ladies, who, for their faith, were infamously\r\ncondemned to death. As they were passing over a wide plain, covered\r\nwith broken woods and heath, they were encountered by a body of\r\nProtestants. A desperate battle immediately ensued. The Protestants,\r\nimpelled by a noble chivalry as well as by religious fervor, rushed\r\nupon their foes with such impetuosity that resistance was unavailing,\r\nand the Catholics threw down their arms and implored quarter. Many of\r\nthese soldiers were from the city of Dux. The leader of the Protestant\r\nband remembered that at the Massacre of St. Bartholomew all the\r\nProtestants in that city had been slain without mercy. With a most\r\ndeplorable want of magnanimity, he caused all the prisoners who\r\nbelonged to that place to be separated from the rest, and in cold\r\nblood they were slaughtered.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the prisoners were from the city of Bayonne, whose\r\ninhabitants, though Catholics, had nobly refused to imbrue their hands\r\nin the blood of that horrible massacre which Charles IX. had enjoined.\r\nTo them, after they had seen their comrades surrendered to butchery\r\nbefore their eyes, he restored their horses and their arms, and gave\r\nthem their entire liberty.\r\n\r\n\"Go,\" said he, \"to your homes, and there tell the different treatment\r\nwhich I show to soldiers and to assassins.\"\r\n\r\nThe three ladies, thus rescued from impending death, were borne back\r\nin triumph to their friends. Eight days after this, a trumpet was\r\nsounded and a flag of truce appeared emerging from the gates of\r\nBayonne. The friends of the Catholic soldiers who had been thus\r\ngenerously restored sent a beautifully embroidered scarf and a\r\nhandkerchief to each one of the Protestant soldiers.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular illustration of the blending of the horrors of war\r\nand the courtesies of peace, that in the midst of this sanguinary\r\nconflict, Henry of Navarre, accompanied by only six companions,\r\naccepted an invitation to a fête given by his enemies of the town of\r\nBayonne. He was received with the utmost courtesy. His table was\r\nloaded with luxuries. Voluptuous music floated upon the ear; songs and\r\ndances animated the festive hours. Henry then returned to head his\r\narmy and to meet his entertainers in the carnage of the field of\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nThere was but little repose in France during the year 1577. Skirmish\r\nsucceeded skirmish, and battle was followed by battle; cities were\r\nbombarded, villages burned, fields ravaged. All the pursuits of\r\nindustry were arrested. Ruin, beggary, and woe desolated thousands of\r\nonce happy homes. Still the Protestants were unsubdued. The king's\r\nresources at length were entirely exhausted, and he was compelled\r\nagain to conclude a treaty of peace. Both parties immediately\r\ndisbanded their forces, and the blessings of repose followed the\r\ndiscords of war.\r\n\r\nOne of the Protestant generals, immediately upon receiving the tidings\r\nof peace, set out at the utmost speed of his horse to convey the\r\nintelligence to Languedoc, where very numerous forces of Protestants\r\nand Catholics were preparing for conflict. He spurred his steed over\r\nhills and plains till he saw, gleaming in the rays of the morning sun,\r\nthe banners of the embattled hosts arrayed against each other on a\r\nvast plain. The drums and the trumpets were just beginning to sound\r\nthe dreadful charge which in a few moments would strew that plain with\r\nmangled limbs and crimson it with blood. The artillery on the\r\nadjoining eminences was beginning to utter its voice of thunder, as\r\nballs, more destructive than the fabled bolts of Jove, were thrown\r\ninto the massive columns marching to the dreadful onset. A few moments\r\nlater, and the cry, the uproar, and the confusion of the battle would\r\nblind every eye and deafen every ear. La Noue, almost frantic with the\r\ndesire to stop the needless effusion of blood, at the imminent risk of\r\nbeing shot, galloped between the antagonistic armies, waving\r\nenergetically the white banner of peace, and succeeded in arresting\r\nthe battle. His generous effort saved the lives of thousands.\r\n\r\nHenry III. was required, as a pledge of his sincerity, to place in the\r\nhands of the Protestants eight fortified cities. The Reformers were\r\npermitted to conduct public worship unmolested in those places only\r\nwhere it was practiced at the time of signing the treaty. In other\r\nparts of France they were allowed to retain their belief without\r\npersecution, but they were not permitted to meet in any worshiping\r\nassemblies. But even these pledges, confirmed by the Edict of\r\nPoitiers on the 8th of October, 1577, were speedily broken, like all\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nBut in the midst of all these conflicts, while every province in\r\nFrance was convulsed with civil war, the king, reckless of the woes of\r\nhis subjects, rioted in all voluptuous dissipation. He was accustomed\r\nto exhibit himself to his court in those effeminate pageants in which\r\nhe found his only joy, dressed in the flaunting robes of a gay woman,\r\nwith his bosom open and a string of pearls encircling his neck. On one\r\noccasion he gave a fête, when, for the excitement of novelty, the\r\ngentlemen, in female robes, were waited upon by the ladies of the\r\ncourt, who were dressed in male attire, or rather undressed, for their\r\npersons were veiled by the slightest possible clothing. Such was the\r\ncorruption of the court of France, and, indeed, of nearly the whole\r\nrealm in those days of darkness. Domestic purity was a virtue unknown.\r\nLaw existed only in name. The rich committed any crimes without fear\r\nof molestation. In the royal palace itself, one of the favorites of\r\nthe king, in a paroxysm of anger, stabbed his wife and her\r\nwaiting-maid while the unfortunate lady was dressing. No notice\r\nwhatever was taken of this bloody deed. The murderer retained all his\r\noffices and honors, and it was the general sentiment of the people of\r\nFrance that the assassination was committed by the order of the\r\nsovereign, because the lady refused to be entirely subservient to the\r\nwishes of the dissolute king.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE LEAGUE.\r\n\r\n1585-1589\r\n\r\nFormation of the league.--Politics in the pulpit.--The League.--Object\r\nof the League.--The oath.--Influence of the League.--Its\r\nextension.--Vast power of the League.--Alarm of the\r\nProtestants.--Adroit measures of Henry III.--Embarrassment of the\r\nLeaguers.--Excommunication of Henry IV.--Bold retort.--Edict of\r\nNemours.--Anguish of Henry of Navarre.--Death of Francis.--Redoubled\r\nenergies.--Toleration.--The challenge.--Efforts to raise an army.--The\r\nLeaguers baffled.--The hostile meeting.--Appearance of the two\r\narmies.--The charge.--Penitence of Henry of Navarre.--Extraordinary\r\nscene.--The battle of Coutras.--The victory.--Exultation of\r\nthe troops.--Magnanimity of Henry of Navarre.--Conduct of\r\nMarguerite.--Court of Henry of Navarre.--Censure by the clergy.--The\r\nflying squadron.--Intrigue and gallantry.--Influences used by\r\nCatharine.--La Reole.--Treachery of Ussac.--News of the loss of La\r\nReole.--The recapture.--Precarious peace.--Attempt to assassinate\r\nHenry.--The assassin humiliated.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this time there was formed the celebrated league which occupies\r\nso conspicuous a position in the history of the sixteenth century.\r\nHenry III., though conscious that his throne was trembling beneath\r\nhim, and courting now the Catholics and again the Protestants, was\r\nstill amusing himself, day after day, with the most contemptible and\r\ntrivial vices. The extinction of the house of Valois was evidently\r\nand speedily approaching. Henry of Navarre, calm, sagacious, and\r\nenergetic, was rallying around him all the Protestant influences of\r\nEurope, to sustain, in that event, his undeniable claim to the throne.\r\nThe Duke of Guise, impetuous and fearless, hoped, in successful\r\nusurpation, to grasp the rich prize by rallying around his banner all\r\nthe fanatic energies of Catholic Europe.\r\n\r\nHenry III. was alike despised by Catholics and Protestants. His\r\nbrother Francis, though far more impulsive, had but few traits of\r\ncharacter to command respect. He could summon but a feeble band for\r\nhis support. Henry of Guise was the available candidate for the\r\nCatholics. All the priestly influences of France were earnestly\r\ncombined to advance his claims. They declared that Henry of Navarre\r\nhad forfeited every shadow of right to the succession by being a\r\nheretic. The genealogy of the illustrious house of Guise was blazoned\r\nforth, and its descent traced from Charlemagne. It was asserted, and\r\nargued in the pulpit and in the camp, that even the house of Valois\r\nhad usurped the crown which by right belonged to the house of Guise.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, the most formidable secret society was\r\norganized the world has ever known. It assumed the name of The League.\r\nIts object was to exterminate Protestantism, and to place the Duke of\r\nGuise upon the throne. The following are, in brief, its covenant and\r\noath:\r\n\r\n                         THE LEAGUE.\r\n\r\n     In the name of the Holy Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy\r\n     Ghost, this League of Catholic princes, lords, and gentlemen\r\n     shall be instituted to maintain the holy Catholic,\r\n     apostolical, and Roman Church, abjuring all errors to the\r\n     contrary. Should opposition to this league arise in any\r\n     quarter, the associates shall employ all their goods and\r\n     means, and even their own persons unto death, to punish and\r\n     hunt down those opposing. Should any of the Leaguers, their\r\n     associates or friends, be molested, the members of the\r\n     League shall be bound to employ their bodies, goods, and\r\n     means to inflict vengeance upon those thus offending. Should\r\n     any Leaguer, after having taken the oath, withdraw from the\r\n     association under any pretext whatever, the refractory\r\n     member shall be injured, in body and goods, in every manner\r\n     which can be devised, as enemies of God, rebels, and\r\n     disturbers of the public peace. The Leaguers shall swear\r\n     implicit obedience to their chief, and shall aid by counsel\r\n     and service in preserving the League, and in the ruin of all\r\n     who oppose it. All Catholic towns and villages shall be\r\n     summoned secretly, by their several governors, to enter into\r\n     this League, and to furnish arms and men for its execution.\r\n\r\n                         OATH.\r\n\r\n     I swear by God the Creator, touching the Evangelists, and\r\n     upon the pain of eternal damnation, that I have entered\r\n     into this holy Catholic League loyally and sincerely, either\r\n     to command, to obey, or to serve. I promise, upon my life\r\n     and honor, to remain in this League to the last drop of my\r\n     blood, without opposing or retiring upon any pretext\r\n     whatever.\r\n\r\nSuch was the character of secret societies in the sixteenth century. A\r\nmore atrocious confederacy than this the human mind could hardly have\r\nconceived. It was, however, peculiarly calculated to captivate the\r\nmultitude in those days of darkness and blood. Though at first formed\r\nand extended secretly, it spread like wildfire through all the cities\r\nand provinces of France. Princes, lords, gentlemen, artisans, and\r\npeasants rushed into its impious inclosures. The benighted populace,\r\nenthralled by the superstitions of the Church, were eager to manifest\r\ntheir zeal for God by wreaking the most awful vengeance upon\r\n_heretics_. He who, for any cause, declined entering the League, found\r\nhimself exposed to every possible annoyance. His house and his barns\r\nblazed in midnight conflagrations; his cattle were mutilated and\r\nslain; his wife and children were insulted and stoned in the streets.\r\nBy day and by night, asleep and awake, at home and abroad, at all\r\ntimes and every where, he was annoyed by every conceivable form of\r\ninjury and violence.\r\n\r\nSoon the League became so powerful that no farther secrecy was\r\nneedful. It stalked abroad in open day, insulting its foes and\r\nvaunting its invincibility. The gigantic plan it unblushingly avowed\r\nwas to exterminate Protestantism by fire and the sword from France;\r\nthen to drown it in blood in Holland; then to turn to England and\r\npurify that kingdom from the taint of heresy; then to march upon\r\nGermany; and thus to advance from kingdom to kingdom, in their holy\r\ncrusade, until Protestantism should be every where ingulfed in blood\r\nand flame, and the whole of Europe should be again brought back to the\r\ndespotism of Rome.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Guise was the soul of this mammoth conspiracy, though\r\nPhilip II., the bigoted King of Spain, was its recorded\r\ncommander-in-chief. The Protestants were justly alarmed by the\r\nenormous energy of the new power thus suddenly evoked against them.\r\nThe Pope, though at first hostile, soon, with his cardinals, espoused\r\nthe cause of the League, and consecrated to its support all the\r\nweapons which could be wielded by the Vatican. From France, the\r\ndemoniac organization spread through all the kingdoms of Europe.\r\nHundreds of thousands were arrayed beneath its crimson banner. Even\r\nHenry III. in the Louvre, surrounded by his parasites and his\r\nconcubines, trembled as he saw the shadow of this fearful apparition\r\ndarkening his court.\r\n\r\nHe immediately perceived that he must mount the car or be crushed by\r\nit. Adroitly he leaped into the seat of the charioteer and seized the\r\nreins. The demands of the League he adopted as his own, and urged them\r\nwith energy. He issued a proclamation commending the League to his\r\nsubjects, and announcing that he, to set them an example, had signed\r\nits covenant and its oath. The Duke of Guise and his followers were\r\nquite bewildered by this unexpected step.\r\n\r\nThe League had demanded the assembling of the States-General, a body\r\nsomewhat resembling the Congress of the United States. The king\r\nimmediately summoned them to meet. They declared war against the\r\nProtestants. The king adopted the declaration as his own decree, and\r\ncalled loudly for supplies to prosecute the war with vigor. He\r\noutleagued the most violent of the Leaguers in denunciations of the\r\nProtestants, in declaring that but one religion should be tolerated in\r\nFrance, and in clamoring for arms and munitions of war, that _heresy_\r\nmight be utterly extirpated. The Leaguers thus found, to their great\r\nperplexity, the weapon which they had forged wrested from their hands\r\nand wielded against them. They had organized to drive the imbecile\r\nHenry III. from the throne. He had seized upon that organization, and\r\nwas using it to establish himself more firmly there.\r\n\r\nThe situation of Henry of Navarre was now extremely critical. Pope\r\nSextus V., besides giving the League his Papal blessing, had\r\nfulminated against the King of Navarre the awful thunders of\r\nexcommunication.\r\n\r\nThe bull of excommunication was exceedingly coarse and vulgar in its\r\ndenunciatory terms, calling the King of Navarre \"_this bastard and\r\ndetestable progeny of Bourbons_.\"\r\n\r\nHenry replied to this assault in accents intrepid and resolute, which\r\ncaused Catholic Europe to stand aghast.\r\n\r\n     \"Henry,\" said this bold document, \"by the grace of God King\r\n     of Navarre, sovereign prince of Bearn, first peer and prince\r\n     of France, resists the declaration and excommunication of\r\n     Sextus V., self-styled Pope of Rome, asserts it to be false,\r\n     and maintains that Mr. Sextus, the self-styled Pope, _has\r\n     falsely and maliciously lied;_ that he himself is\r\n     _heretic_, which he will prove in any full and free council\r\n     lawfully assembled; to which if he does not consent and\r\n     submit, as he is bound by the canons, he, the King of\r\n     Navarre, holds and pronounces him to be anti-Christ and\r\n     heretic, and in that quality declares against him perpetual\r\n     and irreconcilable war.\"\r\n\r\nThis energetic protest was placarded in most of the towns of France,\r\nand by some fearless followers of the prince was even attached to the\r\nwalls of the Vatican. The Pope, though at first much irritated, had\r\nthe magnanimity to express his admiration of the spirit manifested by\r\nHenry.\r\n\r\n\"There are but two princes in Europe,\" said he, \"to whom I could\r\nventure to communicate the grand schemes revolving in my mind, Henry\r\nof Navarre and Elizabeth of England; but, unfortunately, they are both\r\nheretics.\"\r\n\r\nHenry III., having no moral principles to guide him in any thing, and\r\nhaving no generous affections of any kind, in carrying out his plan of\r\nwielding the energies of the League without any scruples of\r\nconscience, issued the infamous Edict of Nemours in 1585, which\r\ncommanded every Protestant minister to leave the kingdom within one\r\nmonth, and every member of the Reformed faith either to abjure his\r\nreligion and accept the Catholic faith, or to depart from France\r\nwithin six months. The penalty for disobedience in either of these\r\ncases was _death and the confiscation of property_. This edict was\r\nexecuted with great rigor, and many were burned at the stake.\r\n\r\nHenry of Navarre was amazed, and, for a time, overwhelmed in receiving\r\nthe news of this atrocious decree. He clearly foresaw that it must\r\narouse France and all Europe to war, and that a new Iliad of woes was\r\nto commence. Leaning his chin upon his hand, he was for a long time\r\nlost in profound reverie as he pondered the awful theme. It is said\r\nthat his anguish was so intense, that when he removed his hand his\r\nbeard and mustache on that side were turned entirely gray.\r\n\r\nBut Henry rose with the emergence, and met the crisis with a degree of\r\nenergy and magnanimity which elicited, in those barbarous times, the\r\nadmiration even of his enemies. The Protestants heroically grasped\r\ntheir arms and rallied together for mutual protection. War, with all\r\nits horrors, was immediately resumed.\r\n\r\nAffairs were in this condition when Francis, the Duke of Anjou, was\r\ntaken sick and suddenly died. This removed another obstruction from\r\nthe field, and tended to hasten the crisis. Henry III. was feeble,\r\nexhausted, and childless. Worn out by shameless dissipation, it was\r\nevident to all that he must soon sink into his grave. Who was to be\r\nhis successor? This was the question, above all others, which agitated\r\nFrance and Europe. Henry of Navarre was, beyond all question,\r\nlegitimately entitled to the throne; but he was, in the estimation of\r\nFrance, a _heretic_. The League consequently, in view of the impending\r\nperil of having a Protestant king, redoubled its energies to exclude\r\nhim, and to enthrone their bigoted partisan, Henry of Guise. It was a\r\nterrific struggle. The Protestants saw suspended upon its issue their\r\nproperty, their religious liberty, their lives, their earthly all. The\r\nCatholics were stimulated by all the energies of fanaticism in defense\r\nof the Church. All Catholic Europe espoused the one side, all\r\nProtestant Europe the other. One single word was enough to arrest all\r\nthese woes. That word was TOLERATION.\r\n\r\nWhen Henry III. published his famous Edict of Nemours, commanding the\r\nconversion, the expulsion, or the death of the Protestants, Henry of\r\nNavarre issued another edict replying to the calumnies of the League,\r\nand explaining his actions and his motives. Then adopting a step\r\ncharacteristic of the chivalry of the times, he dispatched a challenge\r\nto the Duke of Guise, defying him to single combat, or, if he objected\r\nto that, to a combat of two with two, ten with ten, or a hundred with\r\na hundred.\r\n\r\n\"In this challenge,\" said Henry, \"I call Heaven to witness that I am\r\nnot influenced by any spirit of bravado, but only by the desire of\r\ndeciding a quarrel which will otherwise cost the lives of thousands.\"\r\n\r\nTo this appeal the duke made no reply. It was by no means for his\r\ninterest to meet on equal terms those whom he could easily outnumber\r\ntwo or three to one.\r\n\r\nThough the situation of Henry of Navarre seemed now almost desperate,\r\nhe maintained his courage and his hope unshaken. His estates were\r\nunhesitatingly sold to raise funds. His friends parted with their\r\njewels for gold to obtain the means to carry on the war. But, with his\r\nutmost efforts, he could raise an army of but four or five thousand\r\nmen to resist two armies of twenty thousand each, headed by the Duke\r\nof Guise and by his brother, the Duke of Mayenne. Fortunately for\r\nHenry, there was but little military capacity in the League, and,\r\nnotwithstanding their vast superiority in numbers, they were\r\ncontinually circumvented in all their plans by the energy and the\r\nvalor of the Protestants.\r\n\r\nThe King of France was secretly rejoiced at the discomfiture of the\r\nLeaguers, yet, expressing dissatisfaction with the Duke of Guise, he\r\nintrusted the command of the armies to one of his petted favorites,\r\nJoyeuse, a rash and fearless youth, who was as prompt to revel in the\r\ncarnage of the battle-field as in the voluptuousness of the palace.\r\nThe king knew not whether to choose victory or defeat for his\r\nfavorite. Victory would increase the influence and the renown of one\r\nstrongly attached to him, and would thus enable him more successfully\r\nto resist the encroachments of the Duke of Guise. Defeat would weaken\r\nthe overbearing power of the Leaguers, and enable Henry III. more\r\nsecurely to retain his position by the balance of the two rival\r\nparties. Joyeuse, ardent and inexperienced, and despising the feeble\r\nband he was to encounter, was eager to display his prowess. He pressed\r\neagerly to assail the King of Navarre. The two armies met upon a\r\nbattle-field a few leagues from Bordeaux. The army of Joyeuse was\r\nchiefly of gay and effeminate courtiers and young nobles, who had too\r\nmuch pride to lack courage, but who possessed but little physical\r\nvigor, and who were quite unused to the hardships and to the\r\nvicissitudes of war.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 20th of October, 1589, as the sun rose over the\r\nhills of Perigord, the two armies were facing each other upon the\r\nplains of Coutras. The Leaguers were decked with unusual splendor, and\r\npresented a glittering array, with gorgeous banners and waving plumes,\r\nand uniforms of satin and velvet embroidered by the hands of the\r\nladies of the court. They numbered twelve thousand men. Henry of\r\nNavarre, with admirable military skill, had posted his six thousand\r\nhardy peasants, dressed in tattered skins, to meet the onset.\r\n\r\nAnd now occurred one of the most extraordinary scenes which history\r\nhas recorded. It was a source of constant grief to the devout\r\nProtestant leaders that Henry of Navarre, notwithstanding his many\r\nnoble traits of character, was not a man of pure morality. Just before\r\nthe battle, Du Plessis, a Christian and a hero, approached the King of\r\nNavarre and said,\r\n\r\n\"Sire, it is known to all that you have sinned against God, and\r\ninjured a respectable citizen of Rochelle by the seduction of his\r\ndaughter. We can not hope that God will bless our arms in this\r\napproaching battle while such a sin remains unrepented of and\r\nunrepaired.\"\r\n\r\nThe king dismounted from his horse, and, uncovering his head, avowed\r\nin the presence of the whole army his sincere grief for what he had\r\ndone; he called all to witness that he thus publicly implored\r\nforgiveness of God, and of the family he had injured, and he pledged\r\nhis word that he would do every thing in his power to repair the\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nThe troops were then called to prayers by the ministers. Every man in\r\nthe ranks fell upon his knees, while one of the clergy implored God to\r\nforgive the sin of their chieftain, and to grant them protection and\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nThe strange movement was seen from the Catholic camp. \"By death,\"\r\nexclaimed Joyeuse, \"the poltroons are frightened. Look! they kneel,\r\nimploring our mercy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not deceive yourself,\" replied an old captain. \"When the Huguenots\r\nget into that position, they are ready for hard fighting.\"\r\n\r\nThe brilliant battalions of the enemy now began to deploy. Some one\r\nspoke of the splendor of their arms. Henry smiled and replied, \"We\r\nshall have the better aim when the fight begins.\" Another ventured to\r\nintimate that the ministers had rebuked him with needless severity. He\r\nreplied, \"We can not be too humble before God, nor too brave before\r\nmen.\" Then turning to his followers, with tears in his eyes, he\r\naddressed to them a short and noble speech. He deplored the calamities\r\nof war, and solemnly declared that he had drawn arms only in\r\nself-defense. \"Let them,\" said he, \"perish who are the authors of this\r\nwar. May the blood shed this day rest upon them alone.\"\r\n\r\nTo his two prominent generals, the Prince of Condé and the Count de\r\nSoissons, he remarked, with a smile, \"To you I shall say nothing but\r\nthat you are of the house of Bourbon, and, please God, I will show you\r\nthis day that I am your elder.\"\r\n\r\nThe battle almost immediately ensued. Like all fierce fights, it was\r\nfor a time but a delirious scene of horror, confusion, and carnage.\r\nBut the Protestants, with sinewy arms, hewed down their effeminate\r\nfoes, and with infantry and cavalry swept to and fro resistlessly over\r\nthe plain. The white plume of Henry of Navarre was ever seen waving in\r\nthe tumultuous throng wherever the battle was waged the fiercest.\r\n\r\nThere was a singular blending of the facetious with the horrible in\r\nthis sanguinary scene. Before the battle, the Protestant preachers, in\r\nearnest sermons, had compared Henry with David at the head of the\r\nLord's chosen people. In the midst of the bloody fray, when the field\r\nwas covered with the dying and the dead, Henry grappled one of the\r\nstandard-bearers of the enemy. At the moment, humorously reminded of\r\nthe flattering comparison of the preachers, he shouted, with waggery\r\nwhich even the excitement of the battle could not repress,\r\n\r\n\"Surrender, you uncircumcised Philistine.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of one hour three thousand of the Leaguers were\r\nweltering in blood upon the plain, Joyeuse himself, their leader,\r\nbeing among the dead. The defeat of the Catholics was so entire that\r\nnot more than one fourth of their number escaped from the field of\r\nCoutras.\r\n\r\nThe victors were immediately assembled upon the bloody field, and,\r\nafter prayers and thanksgiving, they sung, with exultant lips,\r\n\r\n     \"The Lord appears my helper now,\r\n       Nor is my faith afraid\r\n     What all the sons of earth can do,\r\n       Since Heaven affords its aid.\"\r\n\r\nHenry was very magnanimous in the hour of victory. When some one asked\r\nwhat terms he should now demand, after so great a discomfiture of his\r\nfoes, he replied, \"_The same as before the battle_.\"\r\n\r\nIn reading the records of these times, one is surprised to see how\r\nmirth, festivity, and magnificence are blended with blood, misery, and\r\ndespair. War was desolating France with woes which to thousands of\r\nfamilies must have made existence a curse, and yet amid these scenes\r\nwe catch many glimpses of merriment and gayety. At one time we see\r\nHenry III. weeping and groaning upon his bed in utter wretchedness,\r\nand again he appears before us reveling with his dissolute companions\r\nin the wildest carousals. While Henry of Navarre was struggling with\r\nhis foes upon the field of battle, Marguerite, his wife, was dancing\r\nand flirting with congenial paramours amid all the guilty pleasures of\r\nthe court. Henry wrote repeatedly for her to come and join him, but\r\nshe vastly preferred the voluptuousness of the capital to the gloom\r\nand the hardships of the Protestant camp. She never loved her husband,\r\nand while she wished that he might triumph, and thus confer upon her\r\nthe illustrious rank of the Queen of France, she still rejoiced in his\r\nabsence, as it allowed her that perfect freedom which she desired.\r\nWhen she saw indications of approaching peace, she was so\r\napprehensive that she might thus be placed under constraint by the\r\npresence of her husband, that she did what she could to perpetuate\r\ncivil war.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that several of the fortified cities of France\r\nwere in the hands of the Protestants. Henry of Navarre held his\r\ncomparatively humble court in the town of Agen, where he was very much\r\nbeloved and respected by the inhabitants. Though far from\r\nirreproachable in his morals, the purity of his court was infinitely\r\nsuperior to that of Henry III. and his mother Catharine. Henry of\r\nNavarre was, however, surrounded by a body of gay and light-hearted\r\nyoung noblemen, whose mirth-loving propensities and whose often\r\nindecorous festivities he could not control. One evening, at a general\r\nball, these young gentlemen extinguished the lights, and in the\r\ndarkness a scene of much scandal ensued. Henry was severely censured\r\nby the Protestant clergy, and by many others of his friends, for not\r\nholding the members of his court in more perfect control. His\r\npopularity suffered so severely from this occurrence, that it even\r\nbecame necessary for Henry to withdraw his court from the town.\r\n\r\nCatharine and Marguerite, accompanied by a retinue of the most\r\nvoluptuously-beautiful girls of France, set out to visit the court of\r\nHenry of Navarre, which had been transferred to Neruc. Henry, hearing\r\nof their approach, placed himself at the head of five hundred\r\ngentlemen, and hastened to meet his mother-in-law and his wife, with\r\ntheir characteristic and congenial train. These were the\r\ninstrumentalities with which Catharine and Marguerite hoped to bend\r\nthe will of Henry and his friends to suit their purposes. Catharine\r\nhad great confidence in the potency of the influence which these\r\npliant maidens could wield, and they were all instructed in the part\r\nwhich they were to act. She was accustomed to call these allies her\r\n_flying squadron_.\r\n\r\nThere then ensued a long series of negotiations, intermingled with\r\nmirth, gallantry, and intrigue, but the result of which was a treaty\r\nhighly conducive to the interests of the Protestants. Various places\r\nwere designated where their religion should be freely tolerated, and\r\nin which they were to be allowed to build conventicles. They were also\r\npermitted to raise money for the support of their ministers, and\r\nfourteen cities were surrendered to their government. Several\r\nincidents occurred during these negotiations very characteristic of\r\nthe corrupt manners of the times.\r\n\r\nMarguerite devoted herself most energetically to the promotion of the\r\nsuccess of Henry's plans. Catharine found herself, notwithstanding all\r\nher artifice, and all the peculiar seductions of her female\r\nassociates, completely foiled by the sagacity and the firmness of\r\nHenry. She had brought with her Monsieur de Pibrac, a man very\r\ncelebrated for his glowing eloquence and for his powers of persuasion.\r\nThe oratory of Pibrac, combined with the blandishments of the ladies,\r\nwere those co-operative influences which the queen imagined none would\r\nbe able to resist. Marguerite, however, instructed in the school of\r\nCatharine, succeeded in obtaining entire control over the mind of\r\nPibrac himself, and he became a perfect tool in her hands. Catharine,\r\nthus foiled, was compelled to grant far more favorable terms to the\r\nProtestants than she had contemplated.\r\n\r\nLa Reole was one of the towns of security surrendered to the\r\nProtestants. There was, however, so little of good faith in that day,\r\nthat, notwithstanding the pledge of honor, possession of the place\r\ncould only be retained by vigilance. The government of the town had\r\nbeen conferred upon a veteran Protestant general by the name of Ussac.\r\nHis days, from early youth, had been passed on fields of battle. He\r\nwas now far advanced in years, in feeble health, and dreadfully\r\ndisfigured by wounds received in the face. One of the most fascinating\r\nof the ladies of the queen-mother lavished such endearments upon the\r\nold man, already in his dotage, that he lost his principles and all\r\nself-control, and made himself very ridiculous by assuming the airs of\r\na young lover. Henry had the imprudence to join in the mockery with\r\nwhich the court regarded his tenderness. This was an indignity which\r\nan old man could never forget. Instigated by his beautiful seducer, he\r\nbecame entirely unmindful of those principles of honor which had\r\nembellished his life, and in revenge invited a Roman Catholic general\r\nto come and take possession of the town.\r\n\r\nHenry was informed of this act of treachery while dancing at a very\r\nbrilliant entertainment given in his palace. He quietly whispered to\r\nTurenne, Sully, and a few others of his most intimate friends,\r\nrequesting them to escape from the room, gather around them such armed\r\nmen as they could, and join him at a rendezvous in the country. They\r\nall stole unperceived from the mirthful party, concealed their swords\r\nbeneath their cloaks, traveled all night, and arrived, just as the day\r\nbegan to dawn, before the gates of the city. They found the place, as\r\nthey had expected, entirely unprepared for such a sudden attack, and,\r\nrushing in, regained it without difficulty. The Catholic soldiers\r\nretreated to the castle, where they held out a few days, and many of\r\nthem perished in the assault by which it was soon taken.\r\n\r\nSuch was the character of the nominal peace which now existed. A\r\npartisan warfare was still continued throughout France. Catharine and\r\nher maids did every thing in their power to excite dissensions between\r\nthe Protestant leaders. In this they succeeded so well that the Prince\r\nof Condé became so exasperated against Turenne as to challenge him to\r\nsingle combat.\r\n\r\nSuch a peace as we have above described could not, of course, be\r\nlasting. Both parties were soon again gathering all their forces for\r\nwar. There is a tedious monotony in the recital of the horrors of\r\nbattle. Cities bombarded, and sacked, and burned; shells exploding in\r\nthe cradle of infancy and in the chambers of mothers and maidens;\r\nmutilated bodies trampled beneath the hoofs of horses; the cry of the\r\nmaddened onset, the shrieks of the wounded, and the groans of the\r\ndying; the despair of the widow and the orphan; smouldering ruins of\r\nonce happy homes; the fruits of the husbandman's toils trodden into\r\nthe mire; starvation, misery, and death--these are ever the fruits of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nDuring the short interval of peace, many attempts had been made to\r\nassassinate Henry of Navarre by the partisans of the Duke of Guise.\r\nHenry was, one fine morning, setting out with a few friends for a ride\r\nof pleasure. Just as the party were leaving the court-yard, he was\r\ninformed that an assassin, very powerfully mounted, was prepared to\r\nmeet him on the way and to take his life. Henry apparently paid no\r\nheed to the warning, but rode along conversing gayly with his friends.\r\nThey soon met, in a retired part of the way, a stranger, armed\r\naccording to the custom of the times, and mounted upon a very\r\nmagnificent steed, which had been prepared for him to facilitate his\r\nescape after the accomplishment of the fell deed. Henry immediately\r\nrode up to the assassin, addressed him in terms of great familiarity\r\nand cordiality, and, professing to admire the beautiful charger upon\r\nwhich he was mounted, requested him to dismount, that he might try the\r\nsplendid animal. The man, bewildered, obeyed the wishes of the king,\r\nwhen Henry leaped into the saddle, and, seizing the two loaded pistols\r\nat the saddle-bow, looked the man sternly in the eye, and said,\r\n\r\n\"I am told that you seek to kill me. You are now in my power, and I\r\ncould easily put you to death; but I will not harm you.\"\r\n\r\nHe then discharged the two pistols in the air, and permitted the\r\nhumiliated man to mount his horse and ride away unharmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE ASSASSINATION OF THE DUKE OF GUISE AND OF HENRY III.\r\n\r\n1589\r\n\r\nImbecility of the king.--Haughtiness of the Duke of Guise.--The duke\r\ngoes to Paris.--Interview with the king.--Two rival courts.--The\r\nSwiss guard defeated.--Tumult in the city.--Dignity of Achille de\r\nHarlai.--Measures adopted by the duke.--Endeavors to obtain an\r\nassassin.--The king at Blois.--Assassination of the Duke of\r\nGuise.--Interview between the king and Catharine.--Indignation of\r\nthe League.--Anathemas against the king.--The king seeks aid from\r\nthe Protestants.--Desolations of war.--Compact with Henry of\r\nNavarre.--Interview at Plessis les Tours.--The manifesto.--Renewed\r\nwar.--Duchess of Montpensier.--The flag of truce.--Assassination of\r\nHenry III.--Arrival of Henry of Navarre.--Dying scene.--Henry IV.\r\nassumes the crown.--Difficulties of the new reign.--Danger of\r\nassassination.--Religious principles of Henry IV.--News of the death\r\nof Henry III.--Abandoned by the Catholics.--The retreat.--The stand\r\nat Dieppe.--Henry urged to fly to England.--Anecdote.--Arrival of\r\nthe fleet from England.--Bigotry of the Catholics.--Desolation of\r\nFrance.--Ignoble conduct of the League.--Paris besieged.--Assault of\r\nEtampes.--Letter from Lorraine.--Military reprisals.--Activity of\r\nHenry.--Dissension among the Leaguers.--Triumphant progress of\r\nHenry.--Wonderful escape.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe war, again resumed, was fiercely prosecuted. Henry III. remained\r\nmost of the time in the gilded saloons of the Louvre, irritable and\r\nwretched, and yet incapable of any continued efficient exertion. Many\r\nof the zealous Leaguers, indignant at the pusillanimity he displayed,\r\nurged the Duke of Guise to dethrone Henry III. by violence, and openly\r\nto declare himself King of France. They assured him that the nation\r\nwould sustain him by their arms. But the duke was not prepared to\r\nenter upon so bold a measure, as he hoped that the death of the king\r\nwould soon present to him a far more favorable opportunity for the\r\nassumption of the throne. Henry III. was in constant fear that the\r\nduke, whose popularity in France was almost boundless, might supplant\r\nhim, and he therefore forbade him to approach the metropolis.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this prohibition, the haughty duke, accompanied by a\r\nsmall party of his intrepid followers, as if to pay court to his\r\nsovereign, boldly entered the city. The populace of the capital, ever\r\nripe for excitement and insurrection, greeted him with boundless\r\nenthusiasm. Thousands thronged the broad streets through which he\r\npassed with a small but brilliant retinue. Ladies crowded the windows,\r\nwaving scarfs, cheering him with smiles, and showering flowers at his\r\nfeet. The cry resounded along the streets, penetrating even the\r\napartments of the Louvre, and falling appallingly upon the ear of the\r\nking:\r\n\r\n\"Welcome--welcome, great duke. Now you are come, we are safe.\"\r\n\r\nHenry III. was amazed and terrified by this insolence of his defiant\r\nsubject. In bewilderment, he asked those about him what he should do.\r\n\r\n\"Give me the word,\" said a colonel of his guard, \"and I will plunge my\r\nsword through his body.\"\r\n\r\n\"Smite the shepherd,\" added one of the king's spiritual counselors,\r\n\"and the sheep will disperse.\"\r\n\r\nBut Henry feared to exasperate the populace of Paris by the\r\nassassination of a noble so powerful and so popular. In the midst of\r\nthis consultation, the Duke of Guise, accompanied by the queen-mother\r\nCatharine, whom he had first called upon, entered the Louvre, and,\r\npassing through the numerous body-guard of the king, whom he saluted\r\nwith much affability, presented himself before the feeble monarch. The\r\nking looked sternly upon him, and, without any word of greeting,\r\nexclaimed angrily,\r\n\r\n\"Did I not forbid you to enter Paris?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" the duke replied, firmly, but with affected humility, \"I came\r\nto demand justice, and to reply to the accusations of my enemies.\"\r\n\r\nThe interview was short and unrelenting. The king, exasperated almost\r\nbeyond endurance, very evidently hesitated whether to give the signal\r\nfor the immediate execution of his dreaded foe. There were those at\r\nhis side, with arms in their hands, who were eager instantly to obey\r\nhis bidding. The Duke of Guise perceived the imminence of his danger,\r\nand, feigning sudden indisposition, immediately retired. In his own\r\nalmost regal mansion he gathered around him his followers and his\r\nfriends, and thus placed himself in a position where even the arm of\r\nthe sovereign could not venture to touch him.\r\n\r\nThere were now in Paris, as it were, two rival courts, emulating each\r\nother in splendor and power. The one was that of the king at the\r\nLouvre, the other was that of the duke in his palace. It was rumored\r\nthat the duke was organizing a conspiracy to arrest the king and hold\r\nhim a captive. Henry III., to strengthen his body-guard, called a\r\nstrong force of Swiss mercenaries into the city. The retainers of the\r\nduke, acting under the secret instigation of their chieftain, roused\r\nthe populace of Paris to resist the Swiss. Barricades were immediately\r\nconstructed by filling barrels with stones and earth; chains were\r\nstretched across the streets from house to house; and organized bands,\r\narmed with pikes and muskets, threatened even the gates of the Louvre.\r\n\r\nA conflict soon ensued, and the Swiss guard were defeated by the mob\r\nat every point. The Duke of Guise, though he secretly guided all these\r\nmovements, remained in his palace, affecting to have no share in the\r\noccurrences. Night came. Confusion and tumult rioted in the city. The\r\ninsurgent populace, intoxicated and maddened, swarmed around the walls\r\nof the palace, and the king was besieged. The spiritless and terrified\r\nmonarch, disguising himself in humble garb, crept to his stables,\r\nmounted a fleet horse, and fled from the city. Riding at full speed,\r\nhe sought refuge in Chartres, a walled town forty miles southeast of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nThe flight of the king before an insurgent populace was a great\r\nvictory to the duke. He was thus left in possession of the metropolis\r\nwithout any apparent act of rebellion on his own part, and it became\r\nmanifestly his duty to do all in his power to preserve order in the\r\ncapital thus surrendered to anarchy. The duke had ever been the idol\r\nof the populace, but now nearly the whole population of Paris, and\r\nespecially the influential citizens, looked to him as their only\r\nprotector.\r\n\r\nSome, however, with great heroism, still adhered to the cause of the\r\nking. The Duke of Guise sent for Achille de Harlai, President of the\r\nCouncil, and endeavored to win him over to his cause, that he might\r\nthus sanction his usurpation by legal forms; but De Harlai, fixing his\r\neyes steadfastly upon the duke, fearlessly said,\r\n\r\n\"'Tis indeed pitiable when the valet expels his master. As for me, my\r\nsoul belongs to my Maker, and my fidelity belongs to the king. My body\r\nalone is in the hands of the wicked. You talk of assembling the\r\nParliament. When the majesty of the prince is violated, the magistrate\r\nis without authority.\" The intrepid president was seized and\r\nimprisoned.\r\n\r\nThe followers of Henry III. soon gathered around him at Chartres, and\r\nhe fortified himself strongly there. The Duke of Guise, though still\r\nprotesting great loyalty, immediately assumed at Paris the authority\r\nof a sovereign. He assembled around him strong military forces,\r\nprofessedly to protect the capital from disturbance. For a month or\r\ntwo negotiations were conducted between the two parties for a\r\ncompromise, each fearing the other too much to appeal to the decisions\r\nof the sword. At last Henry III. agreed to appoint the Duke of Guise\r\nlieutenant general of France and high constable of the kingdom. He\r\nalso, while pledging himself anew to wage a war of extermination\r\nagainst the Protestants, promised to bind the people of France, by an\r\noath, to exclude from the succession to the throne all persons\r\nsuspected even of Protestantism. This would effectually cut off the\r\nhopes of Henry of Navarre, and secure the crown to the Duke of Guise\r\nupon the death of the king.\r\n\r\nBoth of the antagonists now pretended to a sincere reconciliation, and\r\nHenry, having received Guise at Chartres with open arms, returned to\r\nParis, meditating how he might secure the death of his dreaded and\r\npowerful rival. Imprisonment was not to be thought of, for no fortress\r\nin France could long hold one so idolized by the populace. The king\r\napplied in person to one of his friends, a brave and honest soldier by\r\nthe name of Crillon, to assassinate the duke.\r\n\r\n\"I am not an executioner,\" the soldier proudly replied, \"and the\r\nfunction does not become my rank. But I will challenge the duke to\r\nopen combat, and will cheerfully sacrifice my life that I may take\r\nhis.\"\r\n\r\nThis plan not meeting with the views of the king, he applied to one of\r\nthe commanders of his guard named Lorgnac. This man had no scruples,\r\nand with alacrity undertook to perform the deed. Henry, having retired\r\nto the castle of Blois, about one hundred miles south of Paris,\r\narranged all the details, while he was daily, with the most consummate\r\nhypocrisy, receiving his victim with courteous words and smiles. The\r\nking summoned a council to attend him in his cabinet at Blois on the\r\n23d of December. It was appointed at an early hour, and the Duke of\r\nGuise attended without his usual retinue. He had been repeatedly\r\nwarned to guard against the treachery of Henry, but his reply was,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASSASSINATION OF HENRY, DUKE OF GUISE.]\r\n\r\n\"I do not know that man on earth who, hand to hand with me, would not\r\nhave his full share of fear. Besides, I am always so well attended\r\nthat it would not be easy to find me off my guard.\"\r\n\r\nThe duke arrived at the door of the cabinet after passing through long\r\nfiles of the king's body-guard. Just as he was raising the tapestry\r\nwhich veiled the entrance, Lorgnac sprang upon him and plunged a\r\ndagger into his throat. Others immediately joined in the assault, and\r\nthe duke dropped, pierced with innumerable wounds, dead upon the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nHenry, hearing the noise and knowing well what it signified, very\r\ncoolly stepped from his cabinet into the ante-chamber, and, looking\r\ncalmly upon the bloody corpse, said,\r\n\r\n\"Do you think he is dead, Lorgnac?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire,\" Lorgnac replied, \"he looks like it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good God, how tall he is!\" said the king. \"He seems taller dead than\r\nwhen he was living.\" Then giving the gory body a kick, he exclaimed,\r\n\"Venomous beast, thou shalt cast forth no more venom.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same manner the duke had treated the remains of the noble\r\nAdmiral Coligni, a solemn comment upon the declaration, \"With what\r\nmeasure ye mete it shall be measured to you again.\"\r\n\r\nCardinal Guise, the brother of the duke, was immediately arrested by\r\norder of the king, and sent to prison, where he was assassinated.\r\nHenry III. soon after repaired to the bedside of Catharine his mother,\r\nwho was lying sick in one of the chambers of the castle. Nothing can\r\nshow more clearly the character of the times and of the personages\r\nthan the following laconic dialogue which ensued:\r\n\r\n\"How do you do, mother, this morning?\" inquired the king.\r\n\r\n\"I am better than I have been,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"So am I,\" Henry rejoined, gayly, \"for I have made myself this morning\r\nKing of France by putting to death the King of Paris.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take care,\" this hardened woman exclaimed, \"that you do not soon find\r\nyourself _king of nothing_. Diligence and resolution are now\r\nabsolutely necessary for you.\"\r\n\r\nShe then turned upon her pillow without the slightest apparent\r\nemotion. In twelve days from this time, this wretched queen, deformed\r\nby every vice, without one single redeeming virtue, breathed her last,\r\nseventy years of age. She was despised by the Catholics, and hated by\r\nthe Protestants.\r\n\r\nThese acts of violence and crime roused the League to the most intense\r\nenergy. The murder of the Duke of Guise, and especially the murder of\r\nhis brother, a cardinal in the Church, were acts of impiety which no\r\natonement could expiate. Though Henry was a Catholic, and all his\r\nagents in these atrocious murders were Catholics, the death of the\r\nDuke of Guise increased vastly the probability that Protestant\r\ninfluences might become dominant at court. The Pope issued a bull of\r\nexcommunication against all who should advocate the cause of Henry\r\nIII. The Sorbonne published a decree declaring that the king had\r\nforfeited all right to the obedience of his subjects, and justifying\r\nthem in taking up arms against him. The clergy, from the pulpit,\r\nrefused communion, absolution, and burial in holy ground to every one\r\nwho yielded obedience to \"the perfidious apostate and tyrant; Henry of\r\nValois.\"\r\n\r\nThe League immediately chose the Duke of Mayenne, a surviving brother\r\nof the Duke of Guise, as its head. The Pope issued his anathemas\r\nagainst Henry III., and Spain sent her armies to unite with the\r\nLeague. Henry now found it necessary to court the assistance of the\r\nProtestants. He dreaded to take this step, for he was superstitious in\r\nthe extreme, and he could not endure the thought of any alliance with\r\nheretics. He had still quite a formidable force which adhered to him,\r\nfor many of the highest nobles were disgusted with the arrogance of\r\nthe Guises, and were well aware that the enthronement of the house of\r\nGuise would secure their own banishment from court.\r\n\r\nThe triumph of the League would be total discomfiture to the\r\nProtestants. No freedom of worship or of conscience whatever would be\r\nallowed them. It was therefore for the interest of the Protestants to\r\nsustain the more moderate party hostile to the League. It was\r\nestimated that about one sixth of the inhabitants of France were at\r\nthat time Protestants.\r\n\r\nWretched, war-scathed France was now distracted by three parties.\r\nFirst, there were the Protestants, contending only in self-defense\r\nagainst persecution, and yet earnestly praying that, upon the death of\r\nthe king, Henry of Navarre, the legitimate successor, might ascend the\r\nthrone. Next came those Catholics who were friendly to the claims of\r\nHenry from their respect for the ancient law of succession. Then\r\ncame, combined in the League, the bigoted partisans of the Church,\r\nresolved to exterminate from Europe, with fire and sword, the detested\r\nheresy of Protestantism.\r\n\r\nHenry III. was now at the castle of Blois. Paris was hostile to him.\r\nThe Duke of Mayenne, younger brother of the Duke of Guise, at the head\r\nof five thousand soldiers of the League, marched to the metropolis,\r\nwhere he was received by the Parisians with unbounded joy. He was\r\nurged by the populace and the Parliament in Paris to proclaim himself\r\nking. But he was not yet prepared for so decisive a step.\r\n\r\nNo tongue can tell the misery which now pervaded ill-fated France.\r\nSome cities were Protestant, some were Catholic; division, and war,\r\nand blood were every where. Armed bands swept to and fro, and\r\nconflagration and slaughter deluged the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe king immediately sent to Henry of Navarre, promising to confer\r\nmany political privileges upon the Protestants, and to maintain\r\nHenry's right to the throne, if he would aid him in the conflict\r\nagainst the League. The terms of reconciliation were soon effected.\r\nHenry of Navarre, then leaving his army to advance by rapid marches,\r\nrode forward with his retinue to meet his brother-in-law, Henry of\r\nValois. He found him at one of the ancient palaces of France, Plessis\r\nles Tours. The two monarchs had been friends in childhood, but they\r\nhad not met for many years. The King of Navarre was urged by his\r\nfriends not to trust himself in the power of Henry III. \"For,\" said\r\nthey, \"the King of France desires nothing so much as to obtain\r\nreconciliation with the Pope, and no offering can be so acceptable to\r\nthe Pope as the death of a heretic prince.\"\r\n\r\nHenry hesitated a moment when he arrived upon an eminence which\r\ncommanded a distant view of the palace. Then exclaiming, \"God guides\r\nme, and He will go with me,\" he plunged his spurs into his horse's\r\nside, and galloped forward.\r\n\r\nThe two monarchs met, each surrounded with a gorgeous retinue, in one\r\nof the magnificent avenues which conducted to the castle. Forgetting\r\nthe animosities of years, and remembering only the friendships of\r\nchildhood, they cast themselves cordially into each other's arms. The\r\nmultitude around rent the air with their acclamations.\r\n\r\nHenry of Navarre now addressed a manifesto to all the inhabitants of\r\nFrance in behalf of their woe-stricken country. \"I conjure you all,\"\r\nsaid he, \"Catholics as well as Protestants, to have pity on the state\r\nand on yourselves. We have all done and suffered evil enough. We have\r\nbeen four years intoxicate, insensate, and furious. Is not this\r\nsufficient? Has not God smitten us all enough to allay our fury, and\r\nto make us wise at last?\"\r\n\r\nBut passion was too much aroused to allow such appeals to be heeded.\r\nBattle after battle, with ever-varying success, ensued between the\r\ncombined forces of the king and Henry of Navarre on one side, and of\r\nthe League, aided by many of the princes of Catholic Europe, on the\r\nother. The storms of winter swept over the freezing armies and the\r\nsmouldering towns, and the wail of the victims of horrid war blended\r\nwith the moanings of the gale. Spring came, but it brought no joy to\r\ndesolate, distracted, wretched France. Summer came, and the bright sun\r\nlooked down upon barren fields, and upon a bleeding, starving,\r\nfighting nation. Henry of Navarre, in command of the royal forces, at\r\nthe head of thirty thousand troops, was besieging Paris, which was\r\nheld by the Duke of Mayenne, and boldly and skillfully was conducting\r\nhis approaches to a successful termination. The cause of the League\r\nbegan to wane. Henry III. had taken possession of the castle of St.\r\nCloud, and from its elevated windows looked out with joy upon the bold\r\nassaults and the advancing works.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ASSASSINATION OF HENRY III.]\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the League now resolved to resort again to the old\r\nweapon of assassination. Henry III. was to be killed. But no man could\r\nkill him unless he was also willing to sacrifice his own life. The\r\nDuchess of Montpensier, sister of the Duke of Guise, for the\r\naccomplishment of this purpose, won the love, by caressings and\r\nendearments, of Jaques Clement, an ardent, enthusiastic monk of wild\r\nand romantic imaginings, and of the most intense fanaticism. The\r\nbeautiful duchess surrendered herself without any reserve whatever to\r\nthe paramour she had enticed to her arms, that she might obtain the\r\nentire supremacy over his mind. Clement concealed a dagger in his\r\nbosom, and then went out from the gates of the city accompanied by two\r\nsoldiers and with a flag of truce, ostensibly to take a message to the\r\nking. He refused to communicate his message to any one but the monarch\r\nhimself. Henry III., supposing it to be a communication of importance,\r\nperhaps a proposition to surrender, ordered him to be admitted\r\nimmediately to his cabinet. Two persons only were present with the\r\nking. The monk entered, and, kneeling, drew a letter from the sleeve\r\nof his gown, presented it to the king, and instantly drawing a large\r\nknife from its concealment, plunged it into the entrails of his\r\nvictim. The king uttered a piercing cry, caught the knife from his\r\nbody and struck at the head of his murderer, wounding him above the\r\neye. The two gentlemen who were present instantly thrust their swords\r\nthrough the body of the assassin, and he fell dead.\r\n\r\nThe king, groaning with anguish, was undressed and borne to his bed.\r\nThe tidings spread rapidly, and soon reached the ears of the King of\r\nNavarre, who was a few miles distant at Meudon. He galloped to St.\r\nCloud, and knelt with gushing tears at the couch of the dying monarch.\r\nHenry III. embraced him with apparently the most tender affection. In\r\nbroken accents, interrupted with groans of anguish, he said,\r\n\r\n\"If my wound proves mortal, I leave my crown to you as my legitimate\r\nsuccessor. If my will can have any effect, the crown will remain as\r\nfirmly upon your brow as it was upon that of Charlemagne.\"\r\n\r\nHe then assembled his principal officers around him, and enjoined them\r\nto unite for the preservation of the monarchy, and to sustain the\r\nclaims of the King of Navarre as the indisputable heir to the throne\r\nof France.\r\n\r\nA day of great anxiety passed slowly away, and as the shades of\r\nevening settled down over the palace, it became manifest to all that\r\nthe wound was mortal. The wounded monarch writhed upon his bed in\r\nfearful agony. At midnight, Henry of Navarre, who was busily engaged\r\nsuperintending some of the works of the siege, was sent for, as the\r\nKing of France was dying. Accompanied by a retinue of thirty\r\ngentlemen, he proceeded at full speed to the gates of the castle where\r\nthe monarch was struggling in the grasp of the King of Terrors.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to imagine the emotions which must have agitated the\r\nsoul of Henry of Navarre during this dark and gloomy ride. The day had\r\nnot yet dawned when he arrived at the gates of the castle. The first\r\ntidings he received were, _The king is dead_. It was the 2d of August,\r\n1589.\r\n\r\nHenry of Navarre was now Henry IV., King of France. But never did\r\nmonarch ascend the throne under circumstances of greater perplexity\r\nand peril. Never was a more distracted kingdom placed in the hands of\r\na new monarch. Henry was now thirty-four years of age. The whole\r\nkingdom was convulsed by warring factions. For years France had been\r\ndesolated by all the most virulent elements of religious and political\r\nanimosity. All hearts were demoralized by familiarity with the dagger\r\nof the assassin and the carnage of the battle-field. Almost universal\r\ndepravity had banished all respect for morality and law. The whole\r\nfabric of society was utterly disorganized.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, Henry developed that energy and sagacity\r\nwhich have given him a high position among the most renowned of\r\nearthly monarchs. He immediately assembled around him that portion of\r\nthe royal army in whose fidelity he could confide. Without the delay\r\nof an hour, he commenced dictating letters to all the monarchies of\r\nEurope, announcing his accession to the throne, and soliciting their\r\naid to confirm him in his legitimate rights.\r\n\r\nAs the new sovereign entered the chamber of the deceased king, he\r\nfound the corpse surrounded by many of the Catholic nobility of\r\nFrance. They were ostentatiously solemnizing the obsequies of the\r\ndeparted monarch. He heard many low mutterings from these zealous\r\npartisans of Rome, that they would rather die a thousand deaths than\r\nallow a Protestant king to ascend the throne. Angry eyes glared upon\r\nhim from the tumultuous and mutinous crowd, and, had not Henry retired\r\nto consult for his own safety, he also might have fallen the victim of\r\nassassination. In the intense excitement of these hours, the leading\r\nCatholics held a meeting, and appointed a committee to wait upon\r\nHenry, and inform him that he must immediately abjure Protestantism\r\nand adopt the Catholic faith, or forfeit their support to the crown.\r\n\r\n\"Would you have me,\" Henry replied, \"profess conversion with the\r\ndagger at my throat? And could you, in the day of battle, follow one\r\nwith confidence who had thus proved that he was an apostate and\r\nwithout a God? I can only promise carefully to examine the subject\r\nthat I may be guided to the truth.\"\r\n\r\nHenry was a Protestant from the force of circumstances rather than\r\nfrom conviction. He was not a theologian either in mind or heart, and\r\nhe regarded the Catholics and Protestants merely as two political\r\nparties, the one or the other of which he would join, according as, in\r\nhis view, it might promote his personal interests and the welfare of\r\nFrance. In his childhood he was a Catholic. In boyhood, under the\r\ntuition of his mother, Protestant influences were thrown around him,\r\nand he was nominally a Protestant. He saved his life at St.\r\nBartholomew by avowing the Catholic faith. When he escaped from the\r\nCatholic court and returned to his mother's Protestant court in\r\nNavarre, he espoused with new vigor the cause of his Protestant\r\nfriends. These changes were of course more or less mortifying, and\r\nthey certainly indicated a total want of religious conviction. He now\r\npromised carefully to look at the arguments on both sides of the\r\nquestion, and to choose deliberately that which should seem to him\r\nright. This arrangement, however, did not suit the more zealous of the\r\nCatholics, and, in great numbers, they abandoned his camp and passed\r\nover to the League.\r\n\r\nThe news of the death of Henry III. was received with unbounded\r\nexultation in the besieged city. The Duchess of Montpensier threw her\r\narms around the neck of the messenger who brought her the welcome\r\ntidings, exclaiming,\r\n\r\n\"Ah! my friend, is it true? Is the monster really dead? What a\r\ngratification! I am only grieved to think that he did not know that it\r\nwas I who directed the blow.\"\r\n\r\nShe rode out immediately, that she might have the pleasure herself of\r\ncommunicating the intelligence. She drove through the streets,\r\nshouting from her carriage, \"Good news! good news! the tyrant is\r\ndead.\" The joy of the priests rose to the highest pitch of fanatical\r\nfervor. The assassin was even canonized. The Pope himself condescended\r\nto pronounce a eulogium upon the \"_martyr_,\" and a statue was erected\r\nto his memory, with the inscription, \"St. Jaques Clement, pray for\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nThe League now proclaimed as king the old Cardinal of Bourbon, under\r\nthe title of Charles X., and nearly all of Catholic Europe rallied\r\naround this pretender to the crown. No one denied the validity of the\r\ntitle, according to the principles of legitimacy, of Henry IV. His\r\nrights, however, the Catholics deemed forfeited by his Protestant\r\ntendencies. Though Henry immediately issued a decree promising every\r\nsurety and support to the Catholic religion as the established\r\nreligion of France, still, as he did not also promise to devote all\r\nhis energies to the extirpation of the heresy of Protestantism, the\r\ngreat majority of the Catholics were dissatisfied.\r\n\r\nEpernon, one of the most conspicuous of the Catholic leaders, at the\r\nhead of many thousand Catholic soldiers, waited upon the king\r\nimmediately after the death of Henry III., and informed him that they\r\ncould not maintain a Protestant on the throne. With flying banners and\r\nresounding bugles they then marched from the camp and joined the\r\nLeague. So extensive was this disaffection, that in one day Henry\r\nfound himself deserted by all his army except six thousand, most of\r\nwhom were Protestants. Nearly thirty thousand men had abandoned him,\r\nsome to retire to their homes, and others to join the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe army of the League within the capital was now twenty thousand\r\nstrong. They prepared for a rush upon the scattered and broken ranks\r\nof Henry IV. Firmly, fearlessly, and with well matured plans, he\r\nordered a prompt retreat. Catholic Europe aroused itself in behalf of\r\nthe League. Henry appealed to Protestant Europe to come to his aid.\r\nElizabeth of England responded promptly to his appeal, and promised to\r\nsend a fleet and troops to the harbor of Dieppe, about one hundred\r\nmiles northwest of Paris, upon the shores of the English Channel.\r\nFirmly, and with concentrated ranks, the little army of Protestants\r\ncrossed the Seine. Twenty thousand Leaguers eagerly pursued them,\r\nwatching in vain for a chance to strike a deadly blow. Henry ate not,\r\nslept not, rested not. Night and day, day and night, he was every\r\nwhere present, guiding, encouraging, protecting this valiant band.\r\nPlanting a rear guard upon the western banks of the Seine, the chafing\r\nfoe was held in check until the Royalist army had retired beyond the\r\nOise. Upon the farther banks of this stream Henry again reared his\r\ndefenses, thwarting every endeavor of his enemies, exasperated by such\r\nunexpected discomfiture.\r\n\r\nAs Henry slowly retreated toward the sea, all the Protestants of the\r\nregion through which he passed, and many of the moderate Catholics who\r\nwere in favor of the royal cause and hostile to the house of Guise,\r\nflocked to his standard. He soon found himself, with seven thousand\r\nvery determined men, strongly posted behind the ramparts of Dieppe.\r\n\r\nBut the Duke of Mayenne had also received large accessions. The spears\r\nand banners of his proud host, now numbering thirty-five thousand,\r\ngleamed from all the hills and valleys which surrounded the fortified\r\ncity. For nearly a month there was almost an incessant conflict. Every\r\nmorning, with anxious eyes, the Royalists scanned the watery horizon,\r\nhoping to see the fleet of England coming to their aid. Cheered by\r\nhope, they successfully beat back their assailants. The toils of the\r\nking were immense. With exalted military genius he guided every\r\nmovement, at the same time sharing the toil of the humblest soldier.\r\n\"It is a marvel,\" he wrote, \"how I live with the labor I undergo. God\r\nhave pity upon me, and show me mercy.\"\r\n\r\nSome of Henry's friends, appalled by the strength of the army pursuing\r\nthem, urged him to embark and seek refuge in England.\r\n\r\n\"Here we are,\" Henry replied, \"in France, and here let us be buried.\r\nIf we fly now, all our hopes will vanish with the wind which bears\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nIn a skirmish, one day, one of the Catholic chieftains, the Count de\r\nBélin, was taken captive. He was led to the head-quarters of the king.\r\nHenry greeted him with perfect cordiality, and, noticing the\r\nastonishment of the count in seeing but a few scattered soldiers where\r\nhe had expected to see a numerous army, he said, playfully, yet with\r\na confident air,\r\n\r\n\"You do not perceive all that I have with me, M. de Bélin, for you do\r\nnot reckon God and the right on my side.\"\r\n\r\nThe indomitable energy of Henry, accompanied by a countenance ever\r\nserene and cheerful under circumstances apparently so desperate,\r\ninspired the soldiers with the same intrepidity which glowed in the\r\nbosom of their chief.\r\n\r\nBut at last the valiant little band, so bravely repelling overwhelming\r\nnumbers, saw, to their inexpressible joy, the distant ocean whitened\r\nwith the sails of the approaching English fleet. Shouts of exultation\r\nrolled along their exhausted lines, carrying dismay into the camp of\r\nthe Leaguers. A favorable wind pressed the fleet rapidly forward, and\r\nin a few hours, with streaming banners, and exultant music, and\r\nresounding salutes, echoed and re-echoed from English ships and French\r\nbatteries, the fleet of Elizabeth, loaded to its utmost capacity with\r\nmoney, military supplies, and men, cast anchor in the little harbor of\r\nDieppe.\r\n\r\nNearly six thousand men, Scotch and English, were speedily\r\ndisembarked. The Duke of Mayenne, though his army was still double\r\nthat of Henry IV., did not dare to await the onset of his foes thus\r\nrecruited. Hastily breaking up his encampment, he retreated to Paris.\r\nHenry IV., in gratitude to God for the succor which he had thus\r\nreceived from the Protestant Queen of England, directed that\r\nthanksgivings should be offered in his own quarters according to the\r\nreligious rites of the Protestant Church. This so exasperated the\r\nCatholics, even in his own camp, that a mutiny was excited, and\r\nseveral of the Protestant soldiers were wounded in the fray. So\r\nextreme was the fanaticism at this time that, several Protestants,\r\nafter a sanguinary fight, having been buried on the battle-field\r\npromiscuously in a pit with some Catholics who had fallen by their\r\nside, the priests, even of Henry's army, ordered the Protestant bodies\r\nto be dug up and thrown out as food for dogs.\r\n\r\nWhile these scenes were transpiring in the vicinity of Dieppe, almost\r\nevery part of France was scathed and cursed by hateful war. Every\r\nprovince, city, village, had its partisans for the League or for the\r\nking. Beautiful France was as a volcano in the world of woe, in whose\r\nseething crater flames, and blood, and slaughter, the yell of conflict\r\nand the shriek of agony, blended in horrors which no imagination can\r\ncompass. There was an end to every earthly joy. Cities were bombarded,\r\nfields of grain trampled in the mire, villages burned. Famine rioted\r\nover its ghastly victims. Hospitals were filled with miserable\r\nmultitudes, mutilated and with festering wounds, longing for death.\r\nNot a ray of light pierced the gloom of this dark, black night of\r\ncrime and woe. And yet, undeniably, the responsibility before God must\r\nrest with the League. Henry IV. was the lawful king of France. The\r\nCatholics had risen in arms to resist his rights, because they feared\r\nthat he would grant liberty of faith and worship to the Protestants.\r\n\r\nThe League adopted the most dishonorable and criminal means to\r\nalienate from Henry the affections of the people. They forged letters,\r\nin which the king atrociously expressed joy at the murder of Henry\r\nIII., and declared his determination by dissimulation and fraud to\r\nroot out Catholicism entirely from France. No efforts of artifice were\r\nwanting to render the monarch odious to the Catholic populace. Though\r\nthe Duke of Mayenne occasionally referred to the old Cardinal of\r\nBourbon as the king whom he acknowledged, he, with the characteristic\r\nhaughtiness of the family of Guise, assumed himself the air and the\r\nlanguage of a sovereign. It was very evident that he intended to place\r\nhimself upon the throne.\r\n\r\nHenry IV., with the money furnished by Elizabeth, was now able to pay\r\nhis soldiers their arrears. His army steadily increased, and he soon\r\nmarched with twenty-three thousand troops and fourteen pieces of\r\nartillery to lay siege to Paris. His army had unbounded confidence in\r\nhis military skill. With enthusiastic acclamations they pursued the\r\nretreating insurgents. Henry was now on the offensive, and his troops\r\nwere posted for the siege of Paris, having driven the foe within its\r\nwalls. After one sanguinary assault, the king became convinced that he\r\nhad not with him sufficient force to carry the city. The Duke of\r\nMayenne stood firmly behind the intrenchments of the capital, with an\r\narmy much strengthened by re-enforcements of Spanish and Italian\r\ntroops. Henry accordingly raised the siege, and marched rapidly to\r\nEtampes, some forty miles south of Paris, where a large part of his\r\nfoes had established themselves. He suddenly attacked the town and\r\ncarried it by assault. The unhappy inhabitants of this city had, in\r\nthe course of four months, experienced the horrors of three assaults.\r\nThe city, in that short period, had been taken and retaken three\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nWhile at Etampes, Henry received a letter from the beautiful but\r\ndisconsolate Louisa of Lorraine, the widow of Henry III., imploring\r\nhim to avenge the murder of her husband. The letter was so affecting\r\nthat, when it was read in the king's council, it moved all the members\r\nto tears.\r\n\r\nMany of the citizens of Paris, weary of the miseries of civil war,\r\nwere now disposed to rally around their lawful monarch as the only\r\nmode of averting the horrible calamities which overwhelmed France. The\r\nDuke of Mayenne rigorously arrested all who were suspected of such\r\ndesigns, and four of the most prominent of the citizens were condemned\r\nto death. Henry immediately sent a message to the duke, that if the\r\nsentence were carried into effect, he would retaliate by putting to\r\ndeath some of the Catholic nobles whom he had in his power. Mayenne\r\ndefiantly executed two Royalists. Henry immediately suspended upon a\r\ngibbet two unfortunate Leaguers who were his captives. This decisive\r\nreprisal accomplished its purpose, and compelled Mayenne to be more\r\nmerciful.\r\n\r\nWith great energy, Henry now advanced to Tours, about one hundred and\r\ntwenty miles south of Paris, on the banks of the Loire, taking every\r\ntown by the way, and sweeping all opposition before him. He seldom\r\nslept more than three hours at a time, and seized his meals where he\r\ncould.\r\n\r\n\"It takes Mayenne,\" said Henry, proudly, \"more time to put on his\r\nboots than it does me to win a battle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Henry,\" remarked Pope Sextus V., sadly, \"will surely, in the end,\r\ngain the day, for he spends less hours in bed than Mayenne spends at\r\nthe table.\"\r\n\r\nThough the armies of the League were still superior to the Royalist\r\narmy, victory every where followed the banner of the king. Every day\r\nthere was more and more of union and harmony in his ranks, and more\r\nand more of discord in the armies of the League. There were various\r\naspirants for the throne in case Henry IV. could be driven from the\r\nkingdom, and all these aspirants had their partisans. The more\r\nreasonable portion of the Catholic party soon saw that there could be\r\nno end to civil war unless the rights of Henry IV. were maintained.\r\nEach day consequently witnessed accessions of powerful nobles to his\r\nside. The great mass of the people also, notwithstanding their hatred\r\nof Protestantism and devotion to the Catholic Church, found it\r\ndifficult to break away from their homage to the ancient law of\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\nIt was now manifest to all, that if Henry would but proclaim himself a\r\nCatholic, the war would almost instantly terminate, and the people,\r\nwith almost entire unanimity, would rally around him. Henry IV. was a\r\nlawful monarch endeavoring to put down insurrection. Mayenne was a\r\nrebel contending against his king. The Pope was so unwilling to see a\r\nProtestant sovereign enthroned in France, that he issued a bull of\r\nexcommunication against all who should advocate the cause of Henry IV.\r\nMany of the Royalist Catholics, however, instead of yielding to these\r\nthunders of the Vatican, sent a humble apology to the Pope for their\r\nadherence to the king, and still sustained his cause.\r\n\r\nHenry now moved on with the strides of a conqueror, and city after\r\ncity fell into his hands. Wherever he entered a city, the ever\r\nvacillating multitude welcomed him with acclamations. Regardless of\r\nthe storms of winter, Henry dragged his heavy artillery through the\r\nmire and over the frozen ruts, and before the close of the year 1589\r\nhis banner waved over fifteen fortified cities and over very many\r\nminor towns. The forces of the League were entirely swept from three\r\nof the provinces of France.\r\n\r\nStill Paris was in the hands of the Duke of Mayenne, and a large part\r\nof the kingdom was yet held in subjection by the forces of the League.\r\n\r\nAt one time, in the face of a fierce cannonade, Henry mounted the\r\ntower of a church at Meulun to ascertain the position of the enemy. As\r\nhe was ascending, cannon ball passed between his legs. In returning,\r\nthe stairs were found so shot away that he was compelled to let\r\nhimself down by a rope. All the winter long, the storm of battle raged\r\nin every part of France, and among all the millions of the ill-fated\r\nrealm, there could not then, perhaps, have been found one single\r\nprosperous and happy home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nWAR AND WOE.\r\n\r\n1590-1591\r\n\r\nFerocity of the combatants.--Liberality of Henry.--Preparations for\r\na battle.--Striking phenomenon.--The omen.--Manoeuvres.--Night before\r\nthe battle.--Morning of the battle.--Henry's address to his army.--The\r\nprayer of Henry.--Anecdote.--Magnanimity of Henry.--The battle of\r\nIvry.--Heroism of Henry.--The Leaguers vanquished.--Flight of the\r\nLeaguers.--Detestable conduct of Mayenne.--Lines on the battle of\r\nIvry.--Paris in consternation.--Inexplicable delay.--Magnanimity to\r\nthe Swiss Catholics.--Paris blockaded.--Death of the Cardinal of\r\nBourbon.--Horrors of famine.--Kindness of Henry.--Murmurs in\r\nParis.--The assault.--The suburbs taken.--The Duchess of\r\nMontpensier.--Great clemency of Henry.--Murmurs in the camp.--Desultory\r\nwarfare.--Awful condition of France.--Attempts to conciliate the\r\nCatholics.--Curious challenge.--A new dynasty contemplated.--Trouble\r\nin the camp of Henry.--Motives for abjuring Protestantism.\r\n\r\n\r\nCivil war seems peculiarly to arouse the ferocity of man. Family\r\nquarrels are notoriously implacable. Throughout the whole kingdom of\r\nFrance the war raged with intense violence, brother against brother,\r\nand father against child. Farm-houses, cities, villages, were burned\r\nmercilessly. Old men, women, and children were tortured and slain with\r\ninsults and derision. Maiden modesty was cruelly violated, and every\r\nspecies of inhumanity was practiced by the infuriated antagonists. The\r\nCatholic priests were in general conspicuous for their brutality. They\r\nresolved that the Protestant heresy should be drowned in blood and\r\nterror.\r\n\r\nHenry IV. was peculiarly a humane man. He cherished kind feelings for\r\nall his subjects, and was perfectly willing that the Catholic religion\r\nshould retain its unquestioned supremacy. His pride, however, revolted\r\nfrom yielding to compulsory conversion, and he also refused to become\r\nthe persecutor of his former friends. Indeed, it seems probable that\r\nhe was strongly inclined toward the Catholic faith as, on the whole,\r\nthe safest and the best. He consequently did every thing in his power\r\nto mitigate the mercilessness of the strife, and to win his Catholic\r\nsubjects by the most signal clemency. But no efforts of his could\r\nrestrain his partisans in different parts of the kingdom from severe\r\nretaliation.\r\n\r\nThrough the long months of a cold and dreary winter the awful carnage\r\ncontinued, with success so equally balanced that there was no prospect\r\nof any termination to this most awful of national calamities. Early in\r\nMarch, 1590, the armies of Henry IV. and of the Duke of Mayenne began\r\nto congregate in the vicinity of Ivry, about fifty miles west of\r\nParis, for a decisive battle. The snows of winter had nearly\r\ndisappeared, and the cold rains of spring deluged the roads. The\r\nSabbath of the eleventh of March was wet and tempestuous. As night\r\ndarkened over the bleak and soaked plains of Ivry, innumerable\r\nbattalions of armed men, with spears, and banners, and heavy pieces of\r\nartillery, dragged axle-deep through the mire, were dimly discerned\r\ntaking positions for an approaching battle. As the blackness of\r\nmidnight enveloped them, the storm increased to fearful fury. The gale\r\nfiercely swept the plain, in its loud wailings and its roar drowning\r\nevery human sound. The rain, all the night long, poured down in\r\ntorrents. But through the darkness and the storm, and breasting the\r\ngale, the contending hosts, without even a watch-fire to cheer the\r\ngloom, waited anxiously for the morning.\r\n\r\nIn the blackest hour of the night, a phenomenon, quite unusual at that\r\nseason of the year, presented itself. The lightning gleamed in\r\ndazzling brilliance from cloud to cloud, and the thunder rolled over\r\ntheir heads as if an aerial army were meeting and charging in the\r\nsanguinary fight. It was an age of superstition, and the shivering\r\nsoldiers thought that they could distinctly discern the banners of the\r\nbattling hosts. Eagerly and with awe they watched the surgings of the\r\nstrife as spirit squadrons swept to and fro with streaming banners of\r\nfire, and hurling upon each other the thunderbolts of the skies. At\r\nlength the storm of battle seemed to lull, or, rather, to pass away in\r\nthe distance. There was the retreat of the vanquished, the pursuit of\r\nthe victors. The flash of the guns became more faint, and the roar of\r\nthe artillery diminished as farther and still farther the embattled\r\nhosts vanished among the clouds. Again there was the silence of\r\nmidnight, and no sounds were heard but the plashing of the rain.\r\n\r\nThe Royalists and the insurgents, each party inflamed more or less by\r\nreligious fanaticism, were each disposed to regard the ethereal battle\r\nas waged between the spirits of light and the spirits of darkness,\r\nangels against fiends. Each party, of course, imagined itself as\r\nrepresented by the angel bands, which doubtless conquered. The\r\nphenomenon was thus, to both, the omen of success, and inspired both\r\nwith new energies.\r\n\r\nThe morning dawned gloomily. Both armies were exhausted and nearly\r\nfrozen by the chill storm of the night. Neither of the parties were\r\neager to commence the fight, as each was anxious to wait for\r\nre-enforcements, which were hurrying forward, from distant posts, with\r\nthe utmost possible speed. The two next days were passed in various\r\nmanoeuvres to gain posts of advantage. The night of the 13th came.\r\nHenry took but two hours of repose upon a mattress, and then, every\r\nthing being arranged according to his wishes, spent nearly all the\r\nrest of the night in prayer. He urged the Catholics and the\r\nProtestants in his army to do the same, each according to the rites\r\nof his own Church. The Catholic priests and the Protestant clergy led\r\nthe devotions of their respective bands, and there can be no doubt\r\nwhatever that they implored the aid of God with as perfect a\r\nconviction of the righteousness of their cause as the human heart can\r\nfeel.\r\n\r\nAnd how was it in the army of the Duke of Mayenne? They also looked to\r\nGod for support. The Pope, Christ's vicar upon earth, had blessed\r\ntheir banners. He had called upon all of the faithful to advocate\r\ntheir cause. He had anathematized their foes as the enemies of God and\r\nman, justly doomed to utter extermination. Can it be doubted that the\r\necclesiastics and the soldiers who surrounded the Duke of Mayenne,\r\nready to lay down their lives for the Church, were also, many of them,\r\nsincere in their supplications? Such is bewildered, benighted man.\r\nWhen will he imbibe the spirit of a noble toleration--of a kind\r\nbrotherhood?\r\n\r\nThe morning of the 14th of March arrived. The stars shone brilliantly\r\nin the clear, cold sky. The vast plain of Ivry and its surrounding\r\nhills gleamed with the camp-fires of the two armies, now face to face.\r\nIt is impossible to estimate with precision the two forces. It is\r\ngenerally stated that Henry IV. had from ten to twelve thousand men,\r\nand the Duke of Mayenne from sixteen to twenty thousand.\r\n\r\nBefore the first glimmer of day, Henry mounted his horse, a powerful\r\nbay charger, and riding slowly along his lines, addressed to every\r\ncompany words of encouragement and hope. His spirit was subdued and\r\nhis voice was softened by the influence of prayer. He attempted no\r\nlofty harangue; he gave utterance to no clarion notes of enthusiasm;\r\nbut mildly, gently, with a trembling voice and often with a moistened\r\neye, implored them to be true to God, to France, and to themselves.\r\n\r\n\"Your future fame and your personal safety,\" said he, \"depend upon\r\nyour heroism this day. The crown of France awaits the decision of your\r\nswords. If we are defeated to-day, we are defeated hopelessly, for we\r\nhave no reserves upon which we can fall back.\"\r\n\r\nThen assembling nearly all his little band in a square around him, he\r\nplaced himself upon an eminence where he could be seen by all, and\r\nwhere nearly all could hear him, and then, with clasped hands and eyes\r\nraised to Heaven, offered the following prayer--a truly extraordinary\r\nprayer, so humble and so Christian in its spirit of resignation:\r\n\r\n\"O God, I pray thee, who alone knowest the intentions of man's heart,\r\nto do thy will upon me as thou shalt judge necessary for the weal of\r\nChristendom. And wilt thou preserve me as long as thou seest it to be\r\nneedful for the happiness and the repose of France, and no longer. If\r\nthou dost see that I should be one of those kings on whom thou dost\r\nlay thy wrath, take my life with my crown, and let my blood be the\r\nlast poured out in this quarrel.\"\r\n\r\nThen turning to his troops, he said,\r\n\r\n\"Companions, God is with us. You are to meet His enemies and ours. If,\r\nin the turmoil of the battle, you lose sight of your banner, follow\r\nthe white plume upon my casque. You will find it in the road to\r\nvictory and honor.\"\r\n\r\nBut a few hours before this, General Schomberg, who was in command of\r\nthe auxiliaries furnished to Henry by Germany, urged by the\r\nimportunity of his troops, ventured to ask for their pay, which was in\r\narrears. Henry, irritated, replied,\r\n\r\n\"A man of courage would not ask for money on the eve of a battle.\"\r\n\r\nThe words had no sooner escaped his lips than he regretted them. Henry\r\nnow rode to the quarters of this veteran officer, and thus\r\nmagnanimously addressed him:\r\n\r\n\"General Schomberg, I have insulted you. As this day may be the last\r\nof my life, I would not carry away the honor of a gentleman and be\r\nunable to restore it. I know your valor, and I ask your pardon. I\r\nbeseech you to forgive me and embrace me.\"\r\n\r\nThis was true magnanimity. General Schomberg nobly replied,\r\n\r\n\"Sire, you did, indeed, wound me yesterday, but to-day you kill me.\r\nThe honor you have done me will lead me to lay down my life in your\r\nservice.\"\r\n\r\nA terrible battle immediately ensued. All fought bravely, ferociously,\r\ninfernally. Love and peace are the elements of heaven. Hatred and war\r\nare the elements of hell. Man, upon the battle-field, even in a good\r\ncause, must call to his aid the energies of the world of woe. Rushing\r\nsquadrons swept the field, crushing beneath iron hoofs the dying and\r\nthe dead. Grapeshot mowed down the crowded ranks, splintering bones,\r\nand lacerating nerves, and extorting shrieks of agony which even the\r\nthunders of the battle could not drown. Henry plunged into the\r\nthickest of the fight, every where exposing himself to peril like the\r\nhumblest soldier. The conflict was too desperate to be lasting. In\r\nless than an hour the field of battle was crimson with blood and\r\ncovered with mangled corpses.\r\n\r\nThe Leaguers began to waver. They broke and fled in awful confusion.\r\nThe miserable fugitives were pursued and cut down by the keen swords\r\nof the cavalry, while from every eminence the cannon of the victors\r\nplowed their retreating ranks with balls. Henry himself headed the\r\ncavalry in the impetuous pursuit, that the day might be the more\r\ndecisive. When he returned, covered with blood, he was greeted from\r\nhis triumphant ranks with the shout, _Vive le roi!_\r\n\r\nMarshal Biron, with a powerful reserve, had remained watching the\r\nprogress of the fight, ready to avail himself of any opportunity which\r\nmight present to promote or to increase the discomfiture of the foe.\r\nHe now joined the monarch, saying,\r\n\r\n\"This day, sire, you have performed the part of Marshal Biron, and\r\nMarshal Biron that of the king.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us praise God, marshal,\" answered Henry, \"for the victory is\r\nhis.\"\r\n\r\nThe routed army fled with the utmost precipitation in two directions,\r\none division toward Chartres and the other toward Ivry. The whole\r\nRoyalist army hung upon their rear, assailing them with every\r\navailable missile of destruction. The Duke of Mayenne fled across the\r\nEure. Thousands of his broken bands were crowding the shore, striving\r\nto force their way across the thronged bridge, when the Royalist\r\ncavalry, led by the monarch himself, was seen in the distance spurring\r\nfuriously over the hills. Mayenne himself having passed, in order to\r\nsecure his own safety, cruelly gave the command to destroy the bridge,\r\nleaving the unhappy men who had not yet crossed at the mercy of the\r\nvictors. The bridge was immediately blown up. Many of those thus\r\nabandoned, in their terror cast themselves into the flooded stream,\r\nwhere multitudes were drowned. Others shot their horses and built a\r\nrampart of their bodies. Behind this revolting breastwork they\r\ndefended themselves, until, one after another, they all fell beneath\r\nthe sabres and the bullets of the Protestants. In this dreadful\r\nretreat more than two thousand were put to the sword, large numbers\r\nwere drowned, and many were taken captive.\r\n\r\nIn this day, so glorious to the Royalist cause, more than one half of\r\nthe army of the Leaguers were either slain or taken prisoners. Though\r\nthe Duke of Mayenne escaped, many of his best generals perished upon\r\nthe field of battle or were captured. It is reported that Henry\r\nshouted to his victorious troops as they were cutting down the\r\nfugitives, \"Spare the French; they are our brethren.\"\r\n\r\nThis celebrated battle has often been the theme of the poet. But no\r\none has done the subject better justice than Mr. Macaulay in the\r\nfollowing spirited lines. They are intended to express the feelings of\r\na Huguenot soldier.\r\n\r\n                         THE BATTLE OF IVRY.\r\n\r\n \"The king has come to marshal us, all in his armor dressed.\r\n And he has bound a snow-white plume upon his gallant crest.\r\n He looked upon his people, and a tear was in his eye;\r\n He looked upon the traitors, and his glance was stern and high.\r\n Right graciously he smiled on us, as rolled from wing to wing,\r\n Down all our line, a deafening shout, 'God save our lord the king!'\r\n 'And if my standard-bearer fall, as fall full well he may,\r\n For never saw I promise yet of such a bloody fray,\r\n Press where ye see my white plume shine, amid the ranks of war,\r\n And be your oriflamme to-day the helmet of Navarre.'\r\n\r\n \"'Hurrah! the foes are coming! Hark to the mingled din\r\n Of fife and steed, and trump and drum, and roaring culverin!\r\n The fiery duke is pricking fast across St. Andre's plain,\r\n With all the hireling chivalry of Guelders and Almagne.\r\n Now, by the lips of those we love, fair gentlemen of France,\r\n Charge for the golden lilies now--upon them with the lance!'\r\n A thousand spurs are striking deep, a thousand spears in rest,\r\n A thousand knights are pressing close behind the snow-white crest.\r\n And on they burst, and on they rushed, while, like a guiding star,\r\n Amid the thickest carnage blazed the helmet of Navarre.\r\n\r\n \"Now, God be praised, the day is ours! Mayenne hath turned his rein,\r\n D'Aumale hath cried for quarter, the Flemish count is slain;\r\n Their ranks are breaking like thin clouds before a Biscay gale;\r\n The field is heaped with bleeding steeds, and flags, and cloven mail.\r\n And then we thought on vengeance, and all along our van,\r\n 'Remember St. Bartholomew,' was passed from man to man;\r\n But out spake gentle Henry, 'No Frenchman is my foe;\r\n Down--down with every foreigner! but let your brethren go.'\r\n Oh, was there ever such a knight, in friendship or in war,\r\n As our sovereign lord King Henry, the soldier of Navarre?\"\r\n\r\nThis decisive battle established Henry on the throne. Mayenne still\r\nheld Paris, and many other important fortresses in other parts of\r\nFrance; but his main army was defeated and dispersed, and he could no\r\nlonger venture to encounter Henry in the open field. Having thrown\r\nsome additional forces into Paris, which city he knew that Henry would\r\nimmediately besiege, he fled to Flanders to obtain re-enforcements.\r\n\r\nParis was in consternation. Not a town in its vicinity could resist\r\nthe conqueror. Henry was but two days' march from his rebellious\r\ncapital. The Leaguers could hope for no aid for many weeks. The\r\nRoyalist cause had many friends among the Parisians, eager for an\r\nopportunity to raise within their walls the banner of their lawful\r\nsovereign.\r\n\r\nHenry had now the entire command of the Seine from Rouen to Paris. Had\r\nhe immediately marched upon the capital, there can be no doubt that it\r\nwould have been compelled to surrender; but, for some reason which has\r\nnever been satisfactorily explained, he remained for a fortnight\r\nwithin one day's march of the field of Ivry. Various causes have been\r\nsurmised for this unaccountable delay, but there is no authentic\r\nstatement to be found in any letters written by Henry, or in any\r\ncontemporaneous records. The time, however, thus lost, whatever might\r\nhave been the cause, proved to him a terrible calamity. The partisans\r\nof the League in the city had time to recover from their panic, to\r\nstrengthen their defenses, and to collect supplies.\r\n\r\nOne act of magnanimity which Henry performed during this interval is\r\nworthy of record. Two regiments of Swiss Catholics, who had been sent\r\nto fight beneath the banners of Mayenne, had surrendered to the royal\r\nforces. They were for a few days intensely anxious respecting their\r\nfate. Henry restored to them their ensigns, furnished them with money,\r\nsupplied them with provisions, and sent them back to their native\r\ncountry. He gave them a letter to the Swiss cantons, with dignity\r\nreproaching them for their violation of the friendly treaty existing\r\nbetween Switzerland and the crown of France.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the 28th of March that Henry appeared before the\r\nwalls of Paris. By this time the Leaguers had made preparations to\r\nresist him. Provisions and military stores had been accumulated.\r\nTroops had been hurried into the city, and arrangements were made to\r\nhold out till Mayenne could bring them succor. Now a siege was\r\nnecessary, with all its accompaniments of blood and woe. There were\r\nnow fifty thousand fighting men in the city when Henry commenced the\r\nsiege with but twelve thousand foot and three thousand horse.\r\n\r\nIn this emergence the energy of Henry returned. He took possession of\r\nthe river above and below the city. Batteries were reared upon the\r\nheights of Montmartre and Montfauçon, and cannon balls, portentous of\r\nthe rising storm, began to fall in the thronged streets of the\r\nmetropolis. In the midst of this state of things the old Cardinal of\r\nBourbon died. The Leaguers had pronounced him king under the title of\r\nCharles X. The insurgents, discomfited in battle, and with many rival\r\ncandidates ambitious of the crown, were not in a condition to attempt\r\nto elect another monarch. They thought it more prudent to combine and\r\nfight for victory, postponing until some future day their choice of a\r\nking. The Catholic priests were almost universally on their side, and\r\nurged them, by all the most sacred importunities of religion, rather\r\nto die than to allow a heretic to ascend the throne of France.\r\n\r\nDay after day the siege continued. There were bombardments, and\r\nconflagrations, and sallies, and midnight assaults, and all the\r\ntumult, and carnage, and woe of horrid war. Three hundred thousand\r\nmen, women, and children were in the beleaguered city. All supplies\r\nwere cut off. Famine commenced its ravages. The wheat became\r\nexhausted, and they ate bran. The bran was all consumed, and the\r\nhaggard citizens devoured the dogs and the cats. Starvation came. On\r\nparlor floors and on the hard pavement emaciate forms were stretched\r\nin the convulsions of death. The shrieks of women and children in\r\ntheir dying agonies fell in tones horrible to hear upon the ears of\r\nthe besiegers.\r\n\r\nThe tender heart of Henry was so moved by the sufferings which he was\r\nunwillingly instrumental in inflicting, that he allowed some\r\nprovisions to be carried into the city, though he thus protracted the\r\nsiege. He hoped that this humanity would prove to his foes that he did\r\nnot seek revenge. The Duke of Nemours, who conducted the defense,\r\nencouraged by this unmilitary humanity, that he might relieve himself\r\nfrom the encumbrance of useless mouths, drove several thousands out of\r\nthe city. Henry, with extraordinary clemency, allowed three thousand\r\nto pass through the ranks of his army. He nobly said, \"I can not bear\r\nto think of their sufferings. I had rather conquer my foes by kindness\r\nthan by arms.\" But the number still increasing, and the inevitable\r\neffect being only to enable the combatants to hold out more\r\nstubbornly, Henry reluctantly ordered the soldiers to allow no more to\r\npass.\r\n\r\nThe misery which now desolated the city was awful. Famine bred\r\npestilence. Woe and death were every where. The Duke of Nemours,\r\nyounger brother of the Duke of Mayenne, hoping that Mayenne might yet\r\nbring relief, still continued the defense. The citizens, tortured by\r\nthe unearthly woes which pressed them on every side, began to murmur.\r\nNemours erected scaffolds, and ordered every murmurer to be promptly\r\nhung as a partisan of Henry. Even this harsh remedy could not entirely\r\nsilence fathers whose wives and children were dying of starvation\r\nbefore their eyes.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Mayenne was preparing to march to the relief of the city\r\nwith an army of Spaniards. Henry resolved to make an attempt to take\r\nthe city by assault before their arrival. The hour was fixed at\r\nmidnight, on the 24th of July. Henry watched the sublime and terrific\r\nspectacle from an observatory reared on the heights of Montmartre. In\r\nten massive columns the Royalists made the fierce onset. The besieged\r\nwere ready for them, with artillery loaded to the muzzle and with\r\nlighted torches. An eye-witness thus describes the spectacle:\r\n\r\n    \"The immense city seemed instantly to blaze with\r\n    conflagrations, or rather by an infinity of mines sprung in\r\n    its heart. Thick whirlwinds of smoke, pierced at intervals by\r\n    flashes and long lines of flame, covered the doomed city. The\r\n    blackness of darkness at one moment enveloped it. Again it\r\n    blazed forth as if it were a sea of fire. The roar of cannon,\r\n    the clash of arms, and the shouts of the combatants added to\r\n    the horrors of the night.\"\r\n\r\nBy this attack all of the suburbs were taken, and the condition of the\r\nbesieged rendered more hopeless and miserable. There is no siege upon\r\nrecord more replete with horrors. The flesh of the dead was eaten. The\r\ndry bones of the cemetery were ground up for bread. Starving mothers\r\nate their children. It is reported that the Duchess of Montpensier was\r\noffered three thousand crowns for her dog. She declined the offer,\r\nsaying that she should keep it to eat herself as her last resource.\r\n\r\nThe compassion of Henry triumphed again and again over his military\r\nfirmness. He allowed the women and children to leave the city, then\r\nthe ecclesiastics, then the starving poor, then the starving rich.\r\nEach of these acts of generosity added to the strength of his foes.\r\nThe famished Leaguers were now in a condition to make but a feeble\r\nresistance. Henry was urged to take the city by storm. He could easily\r\ndo this, but fearful slaughter would be the inevitable result. For\r\nthis reason Henry refused, saying,\r\n\r\n\"I am their father and their king. I can not hear the recital of their\r\nwoes without the deepest sympathy. I would gladly relieve them. I can\r\nnot prevent those who are possessed with the fury of the League from\r\nperishing, but to those who seek my clemency I must open my arms.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in August, more than thirty thousand within the walls of the\r\ncity had perished by famine. Mayenne now marched to the relief of\r\nParis. Henry, unwisely, military critics say, raised the siege and\r\nadvanced to meet him, hoping to compel him to a decisive battle.\r\nMayenne skillfully avoided a battle, and still more skillfully threw\r\nabundant supplies into the city.\r\n\r\nAnd now loud murmurs began to arise in the camp of Henry. Many of the\r\nmost influential of the Catholics who adhered to his cause,\r\ndisheartened by this result and by the indications of an endless war,\r\ndeclared that it was in vain to hope that any Protestant could be\r\naccepted as King of France. The soldiers could not conceal their\r\ndiscouragement, and the cause of the king was involved anew in gloom.\r\n\r\nStill Henry firmly kept the field, and a long series of conflicts\r\nensued between detachments of the Royalist army and portions of the\r\nSpanish troops under the command of the Duke of Mayenne and the Duke\r\nof Parma. The energy of the king was roused to the utmost. Victory\r\naccompanied his marches, and his foes were driven before him.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1591 had now arrived, and still unhappy France was one\r\nwide and wasted battle-field. Confusion, anarchy, and misery every\r\nwhere reigned. Every village had its hostile partisans. Catholic\r\ncities were besieged by Protestants, and Protestant towns by\r\nCatholics. In the midst of these terrible scenes, Henry had caught a\r\nglimpse, at the chateau of Coeuvres, of the beautiful face of\r\nGabrielle d'Estrées. Ignobly yielding to a guilty passion, he again\r\nforgot the great affairs of state and the woes of his distracted\r\ncountry in the pursuit of this new amour. The history of this period\r\ncontains but a monotonous record of the siege of innumerable towns,\r\nwith all the melancholy accompaniments of famine and blood. Summer\r\ncame and went, and hardly a sound of joy was heard amid all the hills\r\nand valleys of beautiful but war-scathed France.\r\n\r\nThere was great division existing among the partisans of the League,\r\nthere being several candidates for the throne. There was but one cause\r\nof division in the ranks of Henry. That he was the legitimate\r\nsovereign all admitted. It was evident to all that, would Henry but\r\nabjure Protestantism and embrace the Catholic faith, nearly all\r\nopposition to him would instantly cease. Many pamphlets were issued by\r\nthe priests urging the iniquity of sustaining a _heretic_ upon the\r\nthrone. The Pope had not only anathematized the heretical sovereign,\r\nbut had condemned to eternal flames all who should maintain his cause.\r\n\r\nHenry had no objection to Catholicism. It was the religion of five\r\nsixths of his subjects. He was now anxious to give his adherence to\r\nthat faith, could he contrive some way to do it with decency. He\r\nissued many decrees to conciliate the Romanists. He proclaimed that he\r\nhad never yet had time to examine the subject of religious faith; that\r\nhe was anxious for instruction; that he was ready to submit to the\r\ndecision of a council; and that under no circumstances would he suffer\r\nany change in France detrimental to the Catholic religion. At the same\r\ntime, with energy which reflects credit upon his name, he declared the\r\nbull fulminated against him by Gregory XIV. as abusive, seditious, and\r\ndamnable, and ordered it to be burned by the public hangman.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of November, 1591, Henry, with an army of thirty-five\r\nthousand men, surrounded the city of Rouen. Queen Elizabeth had again\r\nsent him aid. The Earl of Essex joined the royal army with a retinue\r\nwhose splendor amazed the impoverished nobles of France. His own\r\ngorgeous dress, and the caparisons of his steed, were estimated to be\r\nworth sixty thousand crowns of gold. The garrison of Rouen was under\r\nthe command of Governor Villars. Essex sent a curious challenge to\r\nVillars, that if he would meet him on horseback or on foot, in armor\r\nor doublet, he would maintain against him man to man, twenty to\r\ntwenty, or sixty to sixty. To this defiance the earl added, \"I am thus\r\nready to prove that the cause of the king is better than that of the\r\nLeague, that Essex is a braver man than Villars, and that my mistress\r\nis more beautiful than yours.\" Villars declined the challenge,\r\ndeclaring, however, that the three assertions were false, but that he\r\ndid not trouble himself much about the respective beauty of their\r\nmistresses.\r\n\r\nThe weary siege continued many weeks, varied with fierce sallies and\r\nbloody skirmishes. Henry labored in the trenches like a common\r\nsoldier, and shared every peril. He was not wise in so doing, for his\r\nlife was of far too much value to France to be thus needlessly\r\nperiled.\r\n\r\nThe influential Leaguers in Paris now formed the plan to found a new\r\ndynasty in France by uniting in marriage the young Duke of Guise--son\r\nof Henry of Guise who had been assassinated--with Isabella, the\r\ndaughter of Philip II., King of Spain. This secured for their cause\r\nall the energies of the Spanish monarchy. This plan immediately\r\nintroduced serious discord between Mayenne and his Spanish allies, as\r\nMayenne hoped for the crown for himself. About the same time Pope\r\nGregory XIV. died, still more depressing the prospects of Mayenne;\r\nbut, with indomitable vigor of intrigue and of battle, he still\r\ncontinued to guide the movements of the League, and to watch for\r\nopportunities to secure for himself the crown of France.\r\n\r\nThe politics of the nation were now in an inextricable labyrinth of\r\nconfusion. Henry IV. was still sustained by the Protestants, though\r\nthey were ever complaining that he favored too much the Catholics. He\r\nwas also sustained by a portion of the moderate Catholics. They were,\r\nhowever, quite lukewarm in their zeal, and were importunately\r\ndemanding that he should renounce the Protestant faith and avow\r\nhimself a Catholic, or they would entirely abandon him. The Swiss and\r\nGermans in his ranks were filling the camp with murmurs, demanding\r\ntheir arrears of pay. The English troops furnished him by Elizabeth\r\nrefused to march from the coast to penetrate the interior.\r\n\r\nThe League was split into innumerable factions, some in favor of\r\nMayenne, others supporting the young Cardinal of Bourbon, and others\r\nstill advocating the claims of the young Duke of Guise and the Infanta\r\nof Spain. They were all, however, united by a common detestation of\r\nProtestantism and an undying devotion to the Church of Rome.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, though the siege of Rouen was pressed with great\r\nvigor, all efforts to take the place were unavailing. Henry was\r\nrepeatedly baffled and discomfited, and it became daily more evident\r\nthat, as a Protestant, he never could occupy a peaceful throne in\r\nCatholic France. Even many of the Protestant leaders, who were\r\npoliticians rather than theologians, urged Henry to become a Catholic,\r\nas the only possible means of putting an end to this cruel civil war.\r\nThey urged that while his adoption of the Catholic faith would\r\nreconcile the Catholics, the Protestants, confiding in the freedom of\r\nfaith and worship which his just judgment would secure to them, would\r\nprefer him for their sovereign to any other whom they could hope to\r\nobtain. Thus peace would be restored to distracted France. Henry\r\nlistened with a willing mind to these suggestions. To give assurance\r\nto the Catholics of his sincerity, he sent embassadors to Rome to\r\ntreat with the Pope in regard to his reconciliation with the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE CONVERSION OF THE KING.\r\n\r\n1593-1595\r\n\r\nAdvice of the Duke of Sully.--Perplexity of Henry.--Theological\r\nargument of Sully.--Philip of Mornay, Lord of Plessis.--Inflexible\r\nintegrity of Mornay.--Mornay's reply to Henry III.--Attempt to bribe\r\nMornay.--His address to the courtiers.--Indecision of Henry.--Process\r\nof conversion.--Testimony of Sully.--Gabrielle d'Estrées.--Influence\r\nof Gabrielle.--Abjuration of Protestantism.--Public adoption of the\r\nCatholic faith.--Ceremony in the Church of St. Denis.--Alleged\r\nsincerity of the king.--Other motives assigned.--Political effects\r\nof Henry's conversion.--Satisfaction of the people.--Ferocity of\r\nthe Pope.--Coronation of the king.--Paris secretly surrendered.--The\r\nentry to Paris.--Noble conduct.--Justice of Henry IV.--Joy in\r\nParis.--Reconciliation with the Pope.--Henry chastised by proxy.--The\r\nfarce.--Cause of the war.--The Protestants still persecuted.--Scene\r\nof massacre.--Dissatisfaction of both Catholics and\r\nProtestants.--Complaints of the Reformed Churches of France.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis bloody war of the succession had now desolated France for four\r\nyears. The Duke of Sully, one of the most conspicuous of the political\r\nCalvinists, was at last induced to give his influence to lead the king\r\nto accept the Catholic faith. Sully had been Henry's companion from\r\nchildhood. Though not a man of deep religious convictions, he was one\r\nof the most illustrious of men in ability, courage, and integrity.\r\nConversing with Henry upon the distracted affairs of state, he said,\r\none day,\r\n\r\n\"That you should wait for me, being a Protestant, to counsel you to go\r\nto mass, is a thing you should not do, although I will boldly declare\r\nto you that it is the prompt and easy way of destroying all malign\r\nprojects. You will thus meet no more enemies, sorrows, nor\r\ndifficulties _in this world_. As to the _other world_,\" he continued,\r\nsmiling, \"I can not answer for that.\"\r\n\r\nThe king continued in great perplexity. He felt that it was degrading\r\nto change his religion upon apparent compulsion, or for the\r\naccomplishment of any selfish purpose. He knew that he must expose\r\nhimself to the charge of apostasy and of hypocrisy in affirming a\r\nchange of belief, even to accomplish so meritorious a purpose as to\r\nrescue a whole nation from misery. These embarrassments to a\r\nvacillating mind were terrible.\r\n\r\nEarly one morning, before rising, he sent for Sully. The duke found\r\nthe king sitting up in his bed, \"scratching his head in great\r\nperplexity.\" The political considerations in favor of the change urged\r\nby the duke could not satisfy fully the mind of the king. He had still\r\nsome conscientious scruples, imbibed from the teachings of a pious and\r\nsainted mother. The illustrious warrior, financier, and diplomatist\r\nnow essayed the availability of theological considerations, and urged\r\nthe following argument of Jesuitical shrewdness:\r\n\r\n\"I hold it certain,\" argued the duke, \"that whatever be the exterior\r\nform of the religion which men profess, if they live in the\r\nobservation of the Decalogue, believe in the Creed of the apostles,\r\nlove God with all their heart, have charity toward their neighbor,\r\nhope in the mercy of God, and to obtain salvation by the death,\r\nmerits, and justice of Jesus Christ, they can not fail to be saved.\"\r\n\r\nHenry caught eagerly at this plausible argument. The Catholics say\r\nthat no Protestant can be saved, but the Protestants admit that a\r\nCatholic may be, if in heart honest, just, and true. The sophistry of\r\nthe plea in behalf of an _insincere_ renunciation of faith is too\r\npalpable to influence any mind but one eager to be convinced. The king\r\nwas counseled to obey the Decalogue, which _forbids false witness_,\r\nwhile at the same time he was to be guilty of an act of fraud and\r\nhypocrisy.\r\n\r\nBut Henry had another counselor. Philip of Mornay, Lord of Plessis,\r\nhad imbibed from his mother's lips a knowledge of the religion of\r\nJesus Christ. His soul was endowed by nature with the most noble\r\nlineaments, and he was, if man can judge, a devoted and exalted\r\nChristian. There was no one, in those stormy times, more illustrious\r\nas a warrior, statesman, theologian, and orator. \"We can not,\" says a\r\nFrench writer, \"indicate a species of merit in which he did not excel,\r\nexcept that he did not advance his own fortune.\" When but twelve years\r\nof age, a priest exhorted him to beware of the opinions of the\r\nProtestants.\r\n\r\n\"I am resolved,\" Philip replied, firmly, \"to remain steadfast in what\r\nI have learned of the service of God. When I doubt any point, I will\r\ndiligently examine the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles.\"\r\n\r\nHis uncle, the Archbishop of Rheims, advised him to read the fathers\r\nof the Church, and promised him the revenues of a rich abbey and the\r\nprospect of still higher advancement if he would adhere to the\r\nCatholic religion. Philip read the fathers and declined the bribe,\r\nsaying,\r\n\r\n\"I must trust to God for what I need.\"\r\n\r\nAlmost by a miracle he had escaped the Massacre of St. Bartholomew and\r\nfled to England. The Duke of Anjou, who had become King of Poland,\r\nwishing to conciliate the Protestants, wrote to Mornay in his poverty\r\nand exile, proposing to him a place in his ministry. The noble man\r\nreplied,\r\n\r\n\"I will never enter the service of those who have shed the blood of my\r\nbrethren.\"\r\n\r\nHe soon joined the feeble court of the King of Navarre, and adhered\r\nconscientiously, through all vicissitudes, to the Protestant cause.\r\nHenry IV. was abundantly capable of appreciating such a character, and\r\nhe revered and loved Mornay. His services were invaluable to Henry,\r\nfor he seemed to be equally skillful in nearly all departments of\r\nknowledge and of business. He could with equal facility guide an army,\r\nconstruct a fortress, and write a theological treatise. Many of the\r\nmost important state papers of Henry IV. he hurriedly wrote upon the\r\nfield of battle or beneath his wind-shaken tent. Henry III., on one\r\noccasion, had said to him,\r\n\r\n\"How can a man of your intelligence and ability be a Protestant? Have\r\nyou never read the Catholic doctors?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not only have I read the Catholic doctors,\" Mornay replied, \"but I\r\nhave read them with eagerness; for I am flesh and blood like other\r\nmen, and I was not born without ambition. I should have been very glad\r\nto find something to flatter my conscience that I might participate in\r\nthe favors and honors you distribute, and from which my religion\r\nexcludes me; but, above all, I find something which fortifies my\r\nfaith, and the world must yield to conscience.\"\r\n\r\nThe firm Christian principles of Philip of Mornay were now almost the\r\nonly barrier which stood in the way of the conversion of Henry. The\r\nCatholic lords offered Mornay twenty thousand crowns of gold if he\r\nwould no more awaken the scruples of the king. Nobly he replied,\r\n\r\n\"The conscience of my master is not for sale, neither is mine.\"\r\n\r\nGreat efforts were then made to alienate Henry from his faithful\r\nminister. Mornay by chance one day entered the cabinet of the king,\r\nwhere his enemies were busy in their cabals. In the boldness of an\r\nintegrity which never gave him cause to blush, he thus addressed them\r\nin the presence of the sovereign:\r\n\r\n\"It is hard, gentlemen, to prevent the king my master from speaking to\r\nhis faithful servant. The proposals which I offer the king are such\r\nthat I can pronounce them distinctly before you all. I propose to him\r\nto serve God with a good conscience; to keep Him in view in every\r\naction; to quiet the schism which is in his state by a holy\r\nreformation of the Church, and to be an example for all Christendom\r\nduring all time to come. Are these things to be spoken in a corner? Do\r\nyou wish me to counsel him to go to mass? With what conscience shall I\r\nadvise if I do not first go myself? And what is religion, if it can be\r\nlaid aside like a shirt?\"\r\n\r\nThe Catholic nobles felt the power of this moral courage and\r\nintegrity, and one of them, Marshal d'Aumont, yielding to a generous\r\nimpulse, exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"You are better than we are, Monsieur Mornay; and if I said, two days\r\nago, that it was necessary to give you a pistol-shot in the head, I\r\nsay to-day entirely the contrary, and that you should have a statue.\"\r\n\r\nHenry, however, was a politician, not a Christian; and nothing is more\r\namazing than the deaf ear which even apparently good men can turn to\r\nthe pleadings of conscience when they are involved in the mazes of\r\npolitical ambition. The process of conversion was, for decency's sake,\r\nprotracted and ostentatious. As Henry probably had no fixed religious\r\nprinciples, he could with perhaps as much truth say that he was a\r\nCatholic as that he was a Protestant.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of July the king listened to a public argument, five hours\r\nin length, from the Archbishop of Bourges, upon the points of\r\nessential difference between the two antagonistic creeds. Henry found\r\nthe reasoning of the archbishop most comfortably persuasive, and,\r\nhaving separated himself for a time from Mornay, he professed to be\r\nsolemnly convinced that the Roman Catholic faith was the true\r\nreligion. Those who knew Henry the best declare that he was sincere in\r\nthe change, and his subsequent life seems certainly to indicate that\r\nhe was so. The Duke of Sully, who refused to follow Henry into the\r\nCatholic Church, records,\r\n\r\n    \"As uprightness and sincerity formed the depth of his heart,\r\n    as they did of his words, I am persuaded that nothing would\r\n    have been capable of making him embrace a religion which he\r\n    internally despised, or of which he even doubted.\"\r\n\r\nIn view of this long interview with the Archbishop of Bourges, Henry\r\nwrote to the frail but beautiful Gabrielle d'Estrées,\r\n\r\n\"I began this morning to speak to the bishops. On Sunday I shall take\r\nthe perilous leap.\" The king's connection with Gabrielle presented\r\nanother strong motive to influence his conversion. Henry, when a mere\r\nboy, had been constrained by political considerations to marry the\r\nworthless and hateful sister of Charles IX. For the wife thus coldly\r\nreceived he never felt an emotion of affection. She was an unblushing\r\nprofligate. The king, in one of his campaigns, met the beautiful\r\nmaiden Gabrielle in the chateau of her father. They both immediately\r\nloved each other, and a relation prohibited by the divine law soon\r\nexisted between them. Never, perhaps, was there a better excuse for\r\nunlawful love. But guilt ever brings woe. Neither party were happy.\r\nGabrielle felt condemned and degraded, and urged the king to obtain a\r\ndivorce from the notoriously profligate Marguerite of Valois, that\r\ntheir union might be sanctioned by the rites of religion. Henry loved\r\nGabrielle tenderly. Her society was his chiefest joy, and it is said\r\nthat he ever remained faithful to her. He was anxious for a divorce\r\nfrom Marguerite, and for marriage with Gabrielle. But this divorce\r\ncould only be obtained through the Pope. Hence Gabrielle exerted all\r\nher influence to lead the king into the Church, that this most desired\r\nend might be attained.\r\n\r\nThe king now openly proclaimed his readiness to renounce Protestantism\r\nand to accept the Papal Creed. The Catholic bishops prepared an act of\r\nabjuration, rejecting, very decisively, one after another, every\r\ndistinguishing article of the Protestant faith. The king glanced his\r\neye over it, and instinctively recoiled from an act which he seemed to\r\ndeem humiliating. He would only consent to sign a very brief\r\ndeclaration, in six lines, of his return to the Church of Rome. The\r\npaper, however, which he had rejected, containing the emphatic\r\nrecantation of every article of the Protestant faith, was sent to the\r\nPope with the forged signature of the king.\r\n\r\nThe final act of renunciation was public, and was attended with much\r\ndramatic pomp, in the great church of St. Denis. It was Sunday, the\r\ntwenty-fifth of July, 1593. The immense cathedral was richly\r\ndecorated. Flowers were scattered upon the pavements, and garlands and\r\nbanners festooned the streets and the dwellings.\r\n\r\nAt eight o'clock in the morning Henry presented himself before the\r\nmassive portals of the Cathedral. He was dressed in white satin, with\r\na black mantle and chapeau. The white plume, which both pen and pencil\r\nhave rendered illustrious, waved from his hat. He was surrounded by a\r\ngorgeous retinue of nobles and officers of the crown. Several\r\nregiments of soldiers, in the richest uniform, preceded and followed\r\nhim as he advanced toward the church. Though a decree had been issued\r\nstrictly prohibiting the populace from being present at the ceremony,\r\nan immense concourse thronged the streets, greeting the monarch with\r\nenthusiastic cries of \"_Vive le roi!_\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ACT OF ABJURING PROTESTANTISM.]\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of Bourges was seated at the entrance of the church in\r\na chair draped with white damask. The Cardinal of Bourbon, and several\r\nbishops glittering in pontifical robes, composed his brilliant\r\nretinue. The monks of St. Denis were also in attendance, clad in their\r\nsombre attire, bearing the cross, the Gospels, and the holy water.\r\nThus the train of the exalted dignitary of the Church even eclipsed in\r\nsplendor the suite of the king.\r\n\r\nAs Henry approached the door of the church, the archbishop, as if to\r\nrepel intrusion, imperiously inquired,\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am the king,\" Henry modestly replied.\r\n\r\n\"What do you desire?\" demanded the archbishop.\r\n\r\n\"I ask,\" answered the king, \"to be received into the bosom of the\r\nCatholic, Apostolic, and Roman religion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you desire this _sincerely_?\" rejoined the archbishop.\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" the king replied. Then kneeling at the feet of the prelate, he\r\npronounced the following oath:\r\n\r\n    \"I protest and swear, in the presence of Almighty God, to\r\n    live and die in the Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman religion;\r\n    to protect and defend it against all its enemies at the\r\n    hazard of my blood and life, renouncing all heresies contrary\r\n    to it.\"\r\n\r\nThe king then placed a copy of this oath in writing in the hands of\r\nthe archbishop, and kissed the consecrated ring upon his holy finger.\r\nThen entering the Cathedral, he received the absolution of his sins\r\nand the benediction of the Church. A _Te Deum_ was then sung, high\r\nmass was solemnized, and thus the imposing ceremony was terminated.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to treat this whole affair as a farce. The elements of\r\nridicule are abundant. But it was by no means a farce in the vast\r\ninfluences which it evolved. Catholic historians have almost\r\ninvariably assumed that the king acted in perfect good faith, being\r\nfully convinced by the arguments of the Church. Even Henry's\r\nProtestant friend, the Duke of Sully, remarks,\r\n\r\n    \"I should betray the cause of truth if I suffered it even to\r\n    be suspected that policy, the threats of the Catholics, the\r\n    fatigue of labor, the desire of rest, and of freeing himself\r\n    from the tyranny of foreigners, or even the good of the\r\n    people, had entirely influenced the king's resolution. As far\r\n    as I am able to judge of the heart of this prince, which I\r\n    believe I know better than any other person, it was, indeed,\r\n    these considerations which first hinted to him the necessity\r\n    of his conversion; but, in the end, he became convinced in\r\n    his own mind that the Catholic religion was the safest.\"\r\n\r\nOthers have affirmed that it was a shameful act of apostasy, in which\r\nthe king, stimulated by ambition and unlawful love, stooped to\r\nhypocrisy, and feigned a conversion which in heart he despised. He is\r\nrepresented as saying, with levity,\r\n\r\n\"Paris is well worth a mass.\"\r\n\r\nOthers still assert that Henry was humanely anxious to arrest the\r\nhorrors of civil war; to introduce peace to distracted France, and to\r\nsecure the Protestants from oppression. His acceptance of the Catholic\r\nfaith was the only apparent way of accomplishing these results. Being\r\na humane man, but not a man of established Christian principle, he\r\ndeemed it his duty to pursue the course which would accomplish such\r\nresults. The facts, so far as known, are before the reader, and each\r\none can form his own judgment.\r\n\r\nThe announcement throughout the kingdom that Henry had become a\r\nCatholic almost immediately put an end to the civil war. Incited by\r\nthe royal example, many of the leading Protestants, nobles and\r\ngentlemen, also renounced Protestantism, and conformed to the religion\r\nof the state. The chiefs of the League, many of whom were ambitious\r\npolitical partisans rather than zealous theologians, and who were\r\nclamorous for Catholicism only as the means of obtaining power, at\r\nonce relinquished all hope of victory. For a time, however, they still\r\nassumed a hostile attitude, and heaped unmeasured ridicule upon what\r\nthey styled the feigned conversion of the king. They wished to compel\r\nthe monarch to purchase their adhesion at as dear a price as possible.\r\n\r\nMany important cities surrendered to the royal cause under the\r\nstipulation that the preaching of the Protestants should be utterly\r\nprohibited in their precincts and suburbs. Even the Pope, Clement\r\nVIII., a weak and bigoted man, for a time refused to ratify the act of\r\nthe Archbishop of Bourges in absolving Henry from the pains and\r\npenalties of excommunication. He forbade the envoy of Henry to\r\napproach the Vatican. The Duke of Nevers, who was the appointed envoy,\r\nnotwithstanding this prohibition, persisted in his endeavors to obtain\r\nan audience; but the Pope was anxious to have the crown of France in\r\nthe possession of one whose Catholic zeal could not be questioned. He\r\nwould much have preferred to see the fanatic Duke of Mayenne upon the\r\nthrone, or to have promoted the Spanish succession. He therefore\r\ntreated the Duke of Nevers with great indignity, and finally gave him\r\nan abrupt dismission.\r\n\r\nBut the mass of the French people, longing for repose, gladly accepted\r\nthe conversion of the king. One after another the leaders of the\r\nLeague gave in their adhesion to the royal cause. The Duke of Mayenne,\r\nhowever, held out, Paris being still in his possession, and several\r\nother important cities and fortresses being garrisoned by his troops.\r\nThe Pope, at length, having vainly done every thing in his power to\r\nrouse France and Catholic Europe to resist Henry, condescended to\r\nnegotiate. His spirit may be seen in the atrocious conditions which he\r\nproposed. As the price of his absolution, he required that Henry\r\nshould abrogate every edict of toleration, that he should exclude\r\nProtestants from all public offices, and that he should exterminate\r\nthem from the kingdom as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nTo these demands Henry promptly replied, \"I should be justly accused\r\nof shamelessness and ingratitude if, after having received such signal\r\nservices from the Protestants, I should thus persecute them.\"\r\n\r\nHenry was fully aware of the influence of forms upon the imaginations\r\nof the people. He accordingly made preparations for his coronation.\r\nThe event was celebrated with great pomp, in the city of Chartres, on\r\nthe 27th of February, 1594. The Leaguers were now quite disheartened.\r\nEvery day their ranks were diminishing. The Duke of Mayenne,\r\napprehensive that his own partisans might surrender Paris to the king,\r\nand that thus he might be taken prisoner, on the 6th of March, with\r\nhis wife and children, left the city, under the pretense of being\r\ncalled away by important business.\r\n\r\nThree hours after midnight of the 21st of the month the gates were\r\nsecretly thrown open, and a body of the king's troops entered the\r\nmetropolis. They marched rapidly along the silent streets, hardly\r\nencountering the slightest opposition. Before the morning dawned they\r\nhad taken possession of the bridges, the squares, and the ramparts,\r\nand their cannon were planted so as to sweep all the important streets\r\nand avenues.\r\n\r\nThe citizens, aroused by the tramp of infantry and of cavalry, and by\r\nthe rumbling of the heavy artillery over the pavements, rose from\r\ntheir beds, and crowded the windows, and thronged the streets. In the\r\nearly dawn, the king, accompanied by the officers of his staff,\r\nentered the capital. He was dressed in the garb of a civilian, and was\r\nentirely unarmed. All were ready to receive him. Shouts of \"Peace!\r\npeace! Long live the king!\" reverberated in tones of almost delirious\r\njoy through the thoroughfares of the metropolis. Henry thus advanced\r\nthrough the ranks of the rejoicing people to the great cathedral of\r\nNotre Dame, where mass was performed. He then proceeded to the royal\r\npalace of the Louvre, which his officers had already prepared for his\r\nreception. All the bells of the city rung their merriest chimes, bands\r\nof music pealed forth their most exultant strains, and the air was\r\nrent with acclamations as the king, after all these long and bloody\r\nwars, thus peacefully took possession of the capital of his kingdom.\r\n\r\nIn this hour of triumph Henry manifested the most noble clemency. He\r\nissued a decree declaring that no citizen who had been in rebellion\r\nagainst him should be molested. Even the Spanish troops who were in\r\nthe city to fight against him were permitted to depart with their arms\r\nin their hands. As they defiled through the gate of St. Denis, the\r\nking stood by a window, and, lifting his hat, respectfully saluted\r\nthe officers. They immediately approached the magnanimous monarch,\r\nand, bending the knee, thanked him feelingly for his great clemency.\r\nThe king courteously replied,\r\n\r\n\"Adieu, gentlemen, adieu! Commend me to your master, and go in peace,\r\nbut do not come back again.\"\r\n\r\nLa Noue, one of Henry's chief supporters, as he was entering the city,\r\nhad his baggage attached for an old debt. Indignantly he hastened to\r\nthe king to complain of the outrage. The just monarch promptly but\r\npleasantly replied,\r\n\r\n\"We must pay our debts, La Noue. I pay mine.\" Then drawing his\r\nfaithful servant aside, he gave him his jewels to pledge for the\r\ndeliverance of his baggage. The king was so impoverished that he had\r\nnot money sufficient to pay the debt.\r\n\r\nThese principles of justice and magnanimity, which were instinctive\r\nwith the king, and which were daily manifested in multiplied ways,\r\nsoon won to him nearly all hearts. All France had writhed in anguish\r\nthrough years of war and misery. Peace, the greatest of all earthly\r\nblessings, was now beginning to diffuse its joys. The happiness of the\r\nParisians amounted almost to transport. It was difficult for the king\r\nto pass through the streets, the crowd so thronged him with their\r\nacclamations. Many other important towns soon surrendered. But the\r\nhaughty Duke of Mayenne refused to accept the proffered clemency, and,\r\nstrengthened by the tremendous spiritual power of the head of the\r\nChurch, still endeavored to arouse the energies of Papal fanaticism in\r\nFlanders and in Spain.\r\n\r\nSoon, however, the Pope became convinced that all further resistance\r\nwould be in vain. It was but compromising his dignity to be\r\nvanquished, and he accordingly decided to accept reconciliation. In\r\nyielding to this, the Pope stooped to the following silly farce, quite\r\ncharacteristic of those days of darkness and delusion. It was deemed\r\nnecessary that the king should do penance for his sins before he could\r\nbe received to the bosom of holy mother Church. It was proper that the\r\nsevere mother should chastise her wayward child. \"Whom the Lord loveth\r\nhe chasteneth.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the sixteenth of September, 1595. The two embassadors of Henry\r\nIV. kneeled upon the vestibule of one of the churches in Rome as\r\nunworthy to enter. In strains of affected penitence, they chanted the\r\n_Miserere_--\"Have mercy, Lord.\" At the close of every verse they\r\nreceived, in the name of their master, the blows of a little switch on\r\ntheir shoulders. The king, having thus made expiation for his sins,\r\nthrough the reception of this chastisement by proxy, and having thus\r\nemphatically acknowledged the authority of the sacred mother, received\r\nthe absolution of the vicar of Christ, and was declared to be worthy\r\nof the loyalty of the faithful.\r\n\r\nWe have called this a _farce_. And yet can it be justly called so? The\r\nproud spirit of the king must indeed have been humiliated ere he could\r\nhave consented to such a degradation. The spirit ennobled can bid\r\ndefiance to any amount of corporeal pain. It is ignominy alone which\r\ncan punish the soul. The Pope triumphed; the monarch was flogged. It\r\nis but just to remark that the friends of Henry deny that he was\r\naccessory to this act of humiliation.\r\n\r\nThe atrocious civil war, thus virtually, for a time, terminated, was\r\ncaused by the Leaguers, who had bound themselves together in a _secret\r\nsociety_ for the persecution of the Protestants. Their demand was\r\ninexorable that the Protestants throughout France should be proscribed\r\nand exterminated. The Protestants were compelled to unite in\r\nself-defense. They only asked for liberty to worship God according to\r\ntheir understanding of the teachings of the Bible. Henry, to\r\nconciliate the Catholics, was now compelled to yield to many of their\r\nclaims which were exceedingly intolerant. He did this very\r\nunwillingly, for it was his desire to do every thing in his power to\r\nmeliorate the condition of his Protestant friends. But,\r\nnotwithstanding all the kind wishes of the king, the condition of the\r\nProtestants was still very deplorable. Public opinion was vehemently\r\nagainst them. The magistrates were every where their foes, and the\r\ncourts of justice were closed against all their appeals. Petty\r\npersecution and tumultuary violence in a thousand forms annoyed them.\r\nDuring the year of Henry's coronation, a Protestant congregation in\r\nChalaigneraie was assailed by a Catholic mob instigated by the\r\nLeaguers, and two hundred men, women, and children were massacred. A\r\nlittle boy eight years old, in the simplicity of his heart, offered\r\neight coppers which he had in his pocket to ransom his life; but the\r\nmerciless fanatics struck him down. Most of these outrages were\r\ncommitted with entire impunity. The king had even felt himself forced\r\nto take the oath, \"I will endeavor with all my power, in good faith,\r\nto drive from my jurisdiction and estates all the heretics denounced\r\nby the Church.\"\r\n\r\nThe Protestants, finding themselves thus denounced as enemies, and\r\nbeing cut off from all ordinary privileges and from all common\r\njustice, decided, for mutual protection, vigorously to maintain their\r\npolitical organization. The king, though he feigned to be displeased,\r\nstill encouraged them to do so. Though the Protestants were few in\r\nnumbers, they were powerful in intelligence, rank, and energy; and in\r\ntheir emergencies, the strong arm of England was ever generously\r\nextended for their aid. The king was glad to avail himself of their\r\nstrength to moderate the intolerant demands of the Leaguers. Many of\r\nthe Protestants complained bitterly that the king had abandoned them.\r\nOn the other hand, the haughty leaders of the League clamored loudly\r\nthat the king was not a true son of the Church, and, in multiform\r\nconspiracies, they sought his death by assassination.\r\n\r\nThe Protestants held several large assemblies in which they discussed\r\ntheir affairs. They drew up an important document--an address to the\r\nking, entitled, \"Complaints of the Reformed Churches of France.\" Many\r\npages were filled with a narrative of the intolerable grievances they\r\nendured. This paper contained, in conclusion, the following noble\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n     \"And yet, sire, we have among us no Jacobins or Jesuits who\r\n     wish for your life, or Leaguers who aspire to your crown. We\r\n     have never presented, instead of petitions, the points of\r\n     our swords. We are rewarded with _considerations of state_.\r\n     It is not yet time, they say, to grant us an edict. And yet,\r\n     after thirty-five years of persecution, ten years of\r\n     banishment by the edicts of the League, eight years of the\r\n     king's reign, four years of proscription, we are still under\r\n     the necessity of imploring from your majesty an edict which\r\n     shall allow us to enjoy what is common to all your subjects.\r\n     The sole glory of God, the liberty of our consciences, the\r\n     repose of the state, the security of our property and our\r\n     lives--this is the summit of our wishes, and the end of our\r\n     requests.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nREIGN AND DEATH OF HENRY IV.\r\n\r\n1596-1610\r\n\r\nMayenne professes reconciliation.--Terms exacted by the\r\nduke.--Interview between Henry and the duke.--Henry's\r\nrevenge.--Hostility of Spain and Flanders.--Calais taken by\r\nthe Leaguers.--Movement of the nobles.--Energetic reply of\r\nthe king.--Dark days.--Singular accident.--Deplorable state\r\nof France.--Poverty of the king.--Depression of the king.--The\r\nDuke of Sully.--Siege of Amiens.--Its capitulation.--The\r\nEdict of Nantes.--Provisions of the edict.--Clamors of the\r\nCatholics.--Toleration slowly learned.--Dissatisfaction of both\r\nparties.--Progress of affairs.--Prosperity in the kingdom.--Henry's\r\nillness.--Devotion of his subjects.--Hostility of the nobles.--The\r\nMarchioness of Verneuil.--Integrity of Sully.--The slave of love.--The\r\nking's greatness.--Financial skill of Sully.--Co-operation of\r\nHenry.--Solicitations of Gabrielle.--Her death.--Grief of the\r\nking.--The divorce.--Henrietta d'Entragues.--Bold fidelity of\r\nSully.--Marriage to Maria of Medici.--Anecdote.--Grand political\r\nscheme.--Mode of preventing religious quarrels.--Assassination of\r\nthe king.--Character of Henry IV.--The truth to be enforced.--Free\r\nspeech.--Free press.--Free men.--Practical application of the moral.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reconciliation of the king with the Pope presented a favorable\r\nopportunity for the Duke of Mayenne, consistently with his pride, to\r\nabandon the hopeless conflict. He declared that, as the Pope had\r\naccepted the conversion of the king, all his scruples were removed,\r\nand that he could now conscientiously accept him as the sovereign of\r\nFrance. But the power of the haughty duke may be seen in the terms he\r\nexacted.\r\n\r\nThe king was compelled to declare, though he knew to the contrary,\r\nthat, all things considered, it was evident that neither the princes\r\nnor the princesses of the League were at all implicated in the\r\nassassination of Henry III., and to stop all proceedings in Parliament\r\nin reference to that atrocious murder. Three fortified cities were\r\nsurrendered to the duke, to be held by him and his partisans for six\r\nyears, in pledge for the faithful observance of the terms of the\r\ncapitulation. The king also assumed all the debts which Mayenne had\r\ncontracted during the war, and granted a term of six weeks to all the\r\nLeaguers who were still in arms to give in their adhesion and to\r\naccept his clemency.\r\n\r\nThe king was at this time at Monceaux. The Duke of Mayenne hastened to\r\nmeet him. He found Henry riding on horseback in the beautiful park of\r\nthat place with the fair Gabrielle, and accompanied by the Duke of\r\nSully. Mayenne, in compliance with the obsequious etiquette of those\r\ndays, kneeled humbly before the king, embraced his knees, and,\r\nassuring him of his entire devotion for the future, thanked the\r\nmonarch for having delivered him \"from the arrogance of the Spaniards\r\nand from the cunning of the Italians.\"\r\n\r\nHenry, who had a vein of waggery about him, immediately raised the\r\nduke, embraced him with the utmost cordiality, and, taking his arm,\r\nwithout any allusion whatever to their past difficulties, led him\r\nthrough the park, pointing out to him, with great volubility and\r\ncheerfulness, the improvements he was contemplating.\r\n\r\nHenry was a well-built, vigorous man, and walked with great rapidity.\r\nMayenne was excessively corpulent, and lame with the gout. With the\r\nutmost difficulty he kept up with the king, panting, limping, and his\r\nface blazing with the heat. Henry, with sly malice, for some time\r\nappeared not to notice the sufferings of his victim; then, with a\r\nconcealed smile, he whispered to Sully,\r\n\r\n\"If I walk this great fat body much longer, I shall avenge myself\r\nwithout any further trouble.\" Then turning to Mayenne, he added, \"Tell\r\nme the truth, cousin, do I not walk a little too fast for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sire,\" exclaimed the puffing duke, \"I am almost dead with fatigue.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's my hand,\" exclaimed the kind-hearted king, again cordially\r\nembracing the duke. \"Take it, for, on my life, this is all the\r\nvengeance I shall ever seek.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RECONCILIATION WITH MAYENNE.]\r\n\r\nThere were still parts of the kingdom which held out against Henry,\r\nand Spain and Flanders freely supplied men and ammunition to the\r\nfragments of the League. Calais was in the hands of the enemy. Queen\r\nElizabeth of England had ceased to take much interest in the conflict\r\nsince the king had gone over to the Catholics. When Calais was\r\nbesieged by the foe, before its surrender she offered to send her\r\nfleet for its protection if Henry would give the city to her. Henry\r\ntartly replied, \"I had rather be plundered by my enemies than by my\r\nfriends.\"\r\n\r\nThe queen was offended, sent no succor, and Calais passed into the\r\nhands of the Leaguers. The king was exceedingly distressed at the loss\r\nof this important town. It indicated new and rising energy on the part\r\nof his foes. The more fanatical Catholics all over the kingdom, who\r\nhad never been more than half reconciled to Henry, were encouraged to\r\nthink that, after all their defeats, resistance might still be\r\nsuccessful. The heroic energies of the king were, however, not\r\ndepressed by this great disaster. When its surrender was announced,\r\nturning to the gentlemen of his court, he calmly said,\r\n\r\n\"My friends, there is no remedy. Calais is taken, but we must not lose\r\nour courage. It is in the midst of disasters that bold men grow\r\nbolder. Our enemies have had their turn. With God's blessing, who has\r\nnever abandoned me when I have prayed to him with my whole heart, we\r\nshall yet have ours. At any event, I am greatly comforted by the\r\nconviction that I have omitted nothing that was possible to save the\r\ncity. All of its defenders have acquitted themselves loyally and\r\nnobly. Let us not reproach them. On the contrary, let us do honor to\r\ntheir generous defense. And now let us rouse our energies to retake\r\nthe city, that it may remain in the hands of the Spaniards not so many\r\ndays as our ancestors left it years in the hands of the English.\"\r\n\r\nA large body of the nobles now combined to extort from the king some\r\nof the despotic feudal privileges which existed in the twelfth\r\ncentury. They thought that in this hour of reverse Henry would be glad\r\nto purchase their powerful support by surrendering many of the\r\nprerogatives of the crown. After holding a meeting, they appointed the\r\nDuke of Montpensier, who was very young and self-sufficient, to\r\npresent their demands to the king. Their plan was this, that the king\r\nshould consent to the division of France into several large\r\ndepartments, over each of which, as a vassal prince, some\r\ndistinguished nobleman should reign, collecting his own revenues and\r\nmaintaining his own army. Each of these vassal nobles was to be bound,\r\nwhen required, to furnish a military contingent to their liege lord\r\nthe king.\r\n\r\nMontpensier entered the presence of the monarch, and in a long\r\ndiscourse urged the insulting proposal. The king listened calmly, and\r\nwithout interrupting him, to the end. Then, in tones unimpassioned,\r\nbut firm and deliberate, he replied,\r\n\r\n\"My cousin, you must be insane. Such language coming from _you_, and\r\naddressed to _me_, leads me to think that I am in a dream. Views so\r\nfull of insult to the sovereign, and ruin to the state, can not have\r\noriginated in your benevolent and upright mind. Think you that the\r\npeople, having stripped me of the august prerogatives of royalty,\r\nwould respect in you the rights of a prince of the blood? Did I\r\nbelieve that you, in heart, desired to see me thus humiliated, I would\r\nteach you that such an offense is not to be committed with impunity.\r\nMy cousin, abandon these follies. Reveal not your accomplices, but\r\nreply to them that you yourself have such a horror of these\r\npropositions that you will hold him as a deadly enemy who shall ever\r\nspeak to you of them again.\"\r\n\r\nThis firmness crushed the conspiracy; but still darkness and gloom\r\nseemed to rest upon unhappy France. The year 1596 was one of famine\r\nand of pestilence. \"We had,\" says a writer of the times, \"summer in\r\nApril, autumn in May, and winter in June.\" In the city and in the\r\ncountry, thousands perished of starvation. Famishing multitudes\r\ncrowded to the gates of the city in search of food, but in the city\r\nthe plague had broken forth. The authorities drove the mendicants back\r\ninto the country. They carried with them the awful pestilence in every\r\ndirection. At the same time, several attempts were made to assassinate\r\nthe king. Though he escaped the knife of the assassin, he came near\r\nlosing his life by a singular accident.\r\n\r\nThe Princess of Navarre, sister of the king, had accompanied him, with\r\nthe rest of the court, into Picardy. She was taken suddenly ill. The\r\nking called to see her, carrying in his arms his infant son, the\r\nidolized child of the fair Gabrielle. While standing by the bedside of\r\nhis sister, from some unexplained cause, the flooring gave way beneath\r\nthem. Henry instinctively sprang upon the bed with his child.\r\nProvidentially, that portion of the floor remained firm, while all the\r\nrest was precipitated with a crash into the rooms below. Neither\r\nHenry, his sister, or his child sustained any injury.\r\n\r\nThe financial condition of the empire was in a state of utter ruin--a\r\nruin so hopeless that the almost inconceivable story is told that the\r\nking actually suffered both for food and raiment. He at times made\r\nhimself merry with his own ragged appearance. At one time he said\r\ngayly, when the Parliament sent the president, Seguier, to\r\nremonstrate against a fiscal edict,\r\n\r\n\"I only ask to be treated as they treat the monks, with food and\r\nclothing. Now, Mr. President, I often have not enough to eat. As for\r\nmy habiliments, look and see how I am accoutred,\" and he pointed to\r\nhis faded and thread-bare doublet.\r\n\r\nLe Grain, a contemporary, writes, \"I have seen the king with a plain\r\ndoublet of white stuff, all soiled by his cuirass and torn at the\r\nsleeve, and with well-worn breeches, unsewn on the side of the\r\nsword-belt.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the king was thus destitute, the members of the council of\r\nfinance were practicing gross extortion, and living in extravagance.\r\nThe king was naturally light-hearted and gay, but the deplorable\r\ncondition of the kingdom occasionally plunged him into the deepest of\r\nmelancholy. A lady of the court one day remarked to him that he looked\r\nsad.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" he replied, \"how can I be otherwise, to see a people so\r\nungrateful toward their king? Though I have done and still do all I\r\ncan for them, and though for their welfare I would willingly sacrifice\r\na thousand lives had God given me so many, as I have often proved, yet\r\nthey daily attempt my life.\"\r\n\r\nThe council insisted that it was not safe for the king to leave so\r\nmany of the Leaguers in the city, and urged their banishment. The king\r\nrefused, saying,\r\n\r\n\"They are all my subjects, and I wish to love them equally.\"\r\n\r\nThe king now resolved, notwithstanding strong opposition from the\r\nCatholics, to place his illustrious Protestant friend, Sully, at the\r\nhead of the ministry of finance. Sully entered upon his Herculean task\r\nwith shrewdness which no cunning could baffle, and with integrity\r\nwhich no threat or bribe could bias. All the energies of calumny,\r\nmalice, and violence were exhausted upon him, but this majestic man\r\nmoved straight on, heedless of the storm, till he caused order to\r\nemerge from apparently inextricable confusion, and, by just and\r\nhealthy measures, replenished the bankrupt treasury of the state.\r\n\r\nThe king was now pushing the siege of Amiens, which had for some time\r\nbeen in the hands of his enemies. During this time he wrote to his\r\ndevoted friend and faithful minister of finance,\r\n\r\n    \"I am very near the enemy, yet I have scarcely a horse upon\r\n    which I can fight, or a suit of armor to put on. My doublet\r\n    is in holes at the elbows. My kettle is often empty. For\r\n    these two last days I have dined with one and another as I\r\n    could. My purveyors inform me that they have no longer the\r\n    means of supplying my table.\"\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-fifth of June, 1597, Amiens capitulated.\r\n\r\nOne of the kings of England is said to have remarked to his son, who\r\nwas eager to ascend the throne, \"Thou little knowest, my child, what a\r\nheap of cares and sorrows thou graspest at.\" History does, indeed,\r\nprove that \"uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.\" New perplexities\r\nnow burst upon the king. The Protestants, many of them irritated by\r\nhis conversion, and by the tardy and insufficient concessions they\r\nreceived, violently demanded entire equality with the Catholics. This\r\ndemand led to the famous Edict of Nantes. This ordinance, which\r\nreceives its name from the place where it was published, was issued in\r\nthe month of April, 1598. It granted to the Protestants full private\r\nliberty of conscience. It also permitted them to enjoy public worship\r\nin all places where the right was already established. Protestant\r\nlords of the highest rank could celebrate divine service in their\r\ncastles with any number of their retainers. Nobles of the second rank\r\nmight maintain private worship in their mansions, to which thirty\r\npersons could be admitted. Protestants were pronounced to be eligible\r\nto public office. Their children were to be admitted to the schools,\r\ntheir sick to the hospitals, and their poor to a share of the public\r\ncharities. In a few specified places they were permitted to print\r\nbooks. Such, in the main, was the celebrated \"Edict of Nantes.\"\r\n\r\nThe Catholics considered this an enormous and atrocious concession to\r\ndeadly heresy. New clamors blazed forth against Henry, as in heart\r\nfalse to the Church. The Catholic clergy, in one combined voice,\r\nprotested against it, and Pope Clement VIII. declared the Edict of\r\nNantes, which permitted _liberty of conscience to every one, the most\r\nexecrable that was ever made_.\r\n\r\nIt has required centuries of blood and woe to teach even a few\r\nindividuals the true principles of religious liberty. Even in\r\nProtestant lands, the masses of the people have not yet fully learned\r\nthat lesson. All over Catholic Europe, and all through the realms of\r\npaganism, intolerance still sways her cruel and bloody sceptre. These\r\nmiserable religious wars in France, the birth of ignorance,\r\nfanaticism, and depravity, for seventy years polluted the state with\r\ngory scaffolds and blazing stakes. Three thousand millions of dollars\r\nwere expended in the senseless strife, and two millions of lives were\r\nthrown away. At the close of the war, one half of the towns and the\r\nmajestic castles of beautiful France were but heaps of smouldering\r\nruins. All industry was paralyzed. The fields were abandoned to weeds\r\nand barrenness. The heart and the mind of the whole nation was\r\nthoroughly demoralized. Poverty, emaciation, and a semi-barbarism\r\ndeformed the whole kingdom.\r\n\r\nNeither the Catholics nor Protestants were satisfied with the Edict of\r\nNantes. The Parliament of Paris, composed almost entirely of\r\nCatholics, for a long time refused its ratification. Henry called the\r\ncourts before him, and insisted with kindness, but with firmness, that\r\nthe edict should be verified.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, in the long speech which he made upon the\r\noccasion, \"there must be no more distinction between Catholics and\r\nProtestants. All must be good Frenchmen. Let the Catholics convert the\r\nProtestants by the example of a good life. I am a shepherd-king, who\r\nwill not shed the blood of his sheep, but who will seek to bring them\r\nall with kindness into the same fold.\"\r\n\r\nThe Catholic Parliament, thus constrained, finally adopted the edict.\r\nThe Protestants also, perceiving clearly that this was the best that\r\nthe king could do for them, after long discussion in their Consistory,\r\nwhich was, in reality, their Parliament, finally gave in their\r\nadhesion. The adjoining hostile powers, having no longer a party in\r\nFrance to join them, were thus disarmed. They sent embassadors to\r\npromote peace. Friendly treaties were speedily formed, and Henry was\r\nthe undisputed monarch of a kingdom in repose.\r\n\r\nHenry now commenced, with great energy, the promotion of the\r\nprosperity of his exhausted kingdom. To check the warlike spirit which\r\nhad so long been dominant, he forbade any of his subjects, except his\r\nguards, to carry arms. The army was immediately greatly reduced, and\r\npublic expenditures so diminished as materially to lighten the weight\r\nof taxation. Many of the nobles claimed exemption from the tax, but\r\nHenry was inflexible that the public burden should be borne equally by\r\nall. The people, enjoying the long unknown blessings of peace, became\r\nenthusiastically grateful to their illustrious benefactor.\r\n\r\nIn the month of October, 1598, the king was taken dangerously ill. The\r\nwhole nation was in a panic. The touching demonstrations which Henry\r\nthen received of the universal love and homage of his subjects\r\naffected him deeply. But few men find enough happiness in this world\r\nto lead them to cling very tenaciously to life when apparently on a\r\ndying bed. Henry at this time said to his attendants,\r\n\r\n\"I have no fear of death. I do not shrink at all from the great\r\njourney to the spirit land. But I greatly regret being removed from my\r\nbeloved country before I have restored it to complete prosperity.\"\r\n\r\nHappily, the fever was subdued, and he again, with indefatigable\r\ndiligence, resumed his labors. To discourage the extravagance of the\r\nnobles, he set the example of extreme economy in all his personal\r\nexpenses. He indulged in no gaudy equipage, his table was very\r\nfrugally served, and his dress was simple in the extreme. No man in\r\nthe kingdom devoted more hours to labor. He met his council daily, and\r\nin all their conferences exhibited a degree of information,\r\nshrewdness, and of comprehensive statesmanship which astonished the\r\nmost experienced politicians who surrounded him.\r\n\r\nIt was a fierce battle which the king and his minister were compelled\r\nto fight for many years against the haughty nobles, who had ever\r\nregarded the mass of the people but as beasts of burden, made to\r\ncontribute to their pleasure. The demands of these proud aristocrats\r\nwere incessant and inexorable. It is a singular fact that, among them\r\nall, there was not a more thorough-going aristocrat than Sully\r\nhimself. He had a perfect contempt for the people as to any power of\r\nself-government. They were, in his view, but sheep, to be carefully\r\nprotected by a kind shepherd. It was as absurd, he thought, to consult\r\nthem, as it would be for a shepherd to ask the advice of his flock.\r\nBut Sully wished to take good care of the people, to shield them from\r\nall unequal burdens, from all aristocratic usurpations, and to protect\r\nthem with inflexible justice in person and in property. His government\r\nwas absolute in the extreme.\r\n\r\nThe Marchioness of Verneuil, in a towering rage, bitterly reproached\r\nthe duke for preventing her from receiving a monopoly from the king,\r\nwhich would have secured to her an income of some five hundred\r\nthousand dollars a year.\r\n\r\n\"Truly the king will be a great fool,\" exclaimed the enraged\r\nmarchioness, \"if he continues to follow your advice, and thus\r\nalienates so many distinguished families. On whom, pray, should the\r\nking confer favors, if not on his relatives and his influential\r\nfriends?\"\r\n\r\n\"What you say,\" replied the unbending minister, \"would be reasonable\r\nenough if his majesty took the money all out of his own purse. But to\r\nassess a new tax upon the merchants, artisans, laborers, and country\r\npeople will never do. It is by them that the king and all of us are\r\nsupported, and it is enough that they provide for a master, without\r\nhaving to maintain his cousins and friends.\"\r\n\r\nFor twelve years Henry, with his illustrious minister, labored with\r\nunintermitted zeal for the good of France. His love of France was an\r\never-glowing and growing passion for which every thing was to be\r\nsurrendered. Henry was great in all respects but one. He was a slave\r\nto the passion of love. \"And no one,\" says Napoleon, \"can surrender\r\nhimself to the passion of love without forfeiting some palms of\r\nglory.\" This great frailty has left a stain upon his reputation which\r\ntruth must not conceal, which the genius of history with sorrow\r\nregards, and which can never be effaced. He was a great statesman. His\r\nheart was warm and generous. His philanthropy was noble and\r\nall-embracing, and his devotion to the best welfare of France was\r\nsincere and intense. Witness the following memorable prayer as he was\r\njust entering upon a great battle:\r\n\r\n\"O Lord, if thou meanest this day to punish me for my sins, I bow my\r\nhead to the stroke of thy justice. Spare not the guilty. But, Lord, by\r\nthy holy mercy, have pity on this poor realm, and strike not the flock\r\nfor the fault of the shepherd.\"\r\n\r\n\"If God,\" said he at another time, \"shall grant me the ordinary term\r\nof human life, I hope to see France in such a condition that every\r\npeasant shall be able to have a fowl in the pot on Sunday.\"\r\n\r\nThis memorable saying shows both the benevolence of the king and the\r\nexceeding poverty, at that time, of the peasantry of France. Sully, in\r\nspeaking of the corruption which had prevailed and of the measures of\r\nreform introduced, says,\r\n\r\n    \"The revenue annually paid into the royal treasury was thirty\r\n    millions. It could not be, I thought, that such a sum could\r\n    reduce the kingdom of France so low. I resolved to enter upon\r\n    the immense investigation. To my horror, I found that for\r\n    these thirty millions given to his majesty there were\r\n    extorted from the purses of his subjects, I almost blush to\r\n    say, one hundred and fifty millions. After this I was no\r\n    longer ignorant whence the misery of the people proceeded. I\r\n    applied my cares to the authors of this oppression, who were\r\n    the governors and other officers of the army, who all, even\r\n    to the meanest, abused, in an enormous manner, their\r\n    authority over the people. I immediately caused a decree to\r\n    be issued, by which they were prohibited, under great\r\n    penalties, to exact any thing from the people, under any\r\n    title whatever, without a warrant in form.\"\r\n\r\nThe king co-operated cordially with his minister in these rigorous\r\nacts of reform, and shielded him with all the power of the monarchy\r\nfrom the storm of obloquy which these measures drew down upon him. The\r\nproud Duke of Epernon, exasperated beyond control, grossly insulted\r\nSully. Henry immediately wrote to his minister, \"If Epernon challenges\r\nyou, I will be your second.\"\r\n\r\nThe amiable, but sinning and consequently wretched Gabrielle was now\r\nimportunate for the divorce, that she might be lawfully married to the\r\nking. But the children already born could not be legitimated, and\r\nSully so clearly unfolded to the king the confusion which would thus\r\nbe introduced, and the certainty that, in consequence of it, a\r\ndisputed succession would deluge France in blood, that the king,\r\nardently as he loved Gabrielle, was compelled to abandon the plan.\r\nGabrielle was inconsolable, and inveighed bitterly against Sully. The\r\nking for a moment forgot himself, and cruelly retorted,\r\n\r\n\"Know, woman, that a minister like Sully must be dearer to me than\r\neven such a friend as you.\"\r\n\r\nThis harshness broke the heart of the unhappy Gabrielle. She\r\nimmediately left Fontainebleau, where she was at that time with the\r\nking, and retired to Paris, saying, as she bade Henry adieu, \"We shall\r\nnever meet again.\" Her words proved true. On reaching Paris she was\r\nseized with convulsions, gave birth to a lifeless child, and died.\r\nPoor Gabrielle! Let compassion drop a tear over her grave! She was by\r\nnature one of the most lovely and noble of women. She lived in a day\r\nof darkness and of almost universal corruption. Yielding to the\r\ntemptation of a heroic monarch's love, she fell, and a subsequent life\r\nof sorrow was terminated by an awful death, probably caused by poison.\r\n\r\nHenry, as soon as informed of her sickness, mounted his horse to\r\ngallop to Paris. He had proceeded but half way when he was met by a\r\ncourier who informed him that Gabrielle was dead. The dreadful blow\r\nstaggered the king, and he would have fallen from his horse had he not\r\nbeen supported by his attendants. He retired to Fontainebleau, shut\r\nhimself up from all society, and surrendered himself to the most\r\nbitter grief. Sully in vain endeavored to console him. It was long\r\nbefore he could turn his mind to any business. But there is no pain\r\nwhose anguish time will not diminish. New cares and new loves at\r\nlength engrossed the heart where Gabrielle had for a few brief years\r\nso supremely reigned.\r\n\r\nThe utterly profligate Marguerite, now that Gabrielle was dead, whom\r\nshe of course hated, was perfectly willing to assent to a divorce.\r\nWhile arrangements were making to accomplish this end, the king\r\nchanced to meet a fascinating, yet pert and heartless coquette,\r\nHenriette d'Entragues, daughter of Francis Balzac, Lord of Entragues.\r\nThough exceedingly beautiful, she was a calculating, soulless girl,\r\nwho was glad of a chance to sell herself for rank and money. She thus\r\nreadily bartered her beauty to the king, exacting, with the most cool\r\nfinanciering, as the price, a written promise that he would marry her\r\nas soon as he should obtain a divorce from Marguerite of Valois, upon\r\ncondition that she, within the year, should bear him a son.\r\n\r\nThe king, having written the promise, placed it in the hands of Sully.\r\nThe bold minister read it, then tore it into fragments. The king,\r\namazed at such boldness, exclaimed in a passion, \"Sir, I believe that\r\nyou are mad.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, sire, I am,\" replied Sully; \"but would to God that I were the\r\nonly madman in France.\"\r\n\r\nBut Henry, notwithstanding his anger, could not part from a minister\r\nwhose services were so invaluable. He immediately drew up another\r\npromise, which he placed in the hands of the despicable beauty. This\r\nrash and guilty pledge was subsequently the cause of great trouble to\r\nthe king.\r\n\r\nHenry having obtained a divorce, the nation demanded that he should\r\nform a connection which should produce a suitable heir to inherit the\r\nthrone. Thus urged, and as Henrietta did not give birth to the\r\nwished-for son, Henry reluctantly married, in the year 1600, Maria of\r\nMedici, niece of the Grand Duke of Tuscany.\r\n\r\nMaria was a domineering, crafty, ambitious woman, who embittered the\r\nlife of the king. She was very jealous, and with reason enough, of the\r\ncontinued influence of Henrietta; and the palace was the scene of\r\ndisgraceful domestic broils. Henry, in one of his letters to Sully,\r\ndescribes the queen as \"terribly robust and healthy.\" But when she\r\ngave birth to a son who was undeniably heir to the throne, thus\r\nallaying the fears of a disputed succession, the whole nation\r\nrejoiced, and Henry became somewhat reconciled to his unattractive\r\nspouse. The king was exceedingly fond of this child. One day the\r\nSpanish embassador, a dignified Castilian, was rather suddenly ushered\r\ninto the royal presence at Fontainebleau. The monarch was on all fours\r\non the floor, running about the room with the little dauphin on his\r\nback. Raising his eyes, he said to the embassador,\r\n\r\n\"Are you a father?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sire,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Then I may finish my play,\" said Henry, and he took another trot\r\naround the room.\r\n\r\nHenrietta and her relatives were greatly exasperated that the king did\r\nnot fulfill his promise of marriage. The father and daughter, joined\r\nby the Count d'Auvergne, plotted against the king's life. They were\r\narrested and condemned to death. The king, however, transmuted their\r\npunishment to exile.\r\n\r\nOne of the grandest schemes of Henry deserves particular mention.\r\nReflecting deeply upon the wars with which Europe had ever been\r\ndesolated, and seeing the occasion for this in the innumerable states\r\nand nations into which Europe was divided, of various degrees of\r\npower, and each struggling for its own selfish interest, he proposed\r\nto unite all the states of Europe in one vast Christian Republic. The\r\nwhole continent was to be divided into fifteen states, as uniform in\r\nsize and power as possible. These states were to be, according to\r\ntheir choice, monarchical or republican. They were to be associated on\r\na plan somewhat resembling that of the United States of America.\r\n\r\nNothing can more conclusively show the entire absence of correct\r\nnotions of religious toleration prevailing at that day than the plan\r\nproposed to prevent religious quarrels. Wherever any one form of\r\nfaith predominated, that was to be maintained as the national faith.\r\nIn Catholic states, there were to be no Protestants; in Protestant\r\nstates, no Catholics. The minority, however, were not to be\r\nexterminated; they were only to be compelled to emigrate to the\r\ncountries where their own form of faith prevailed. All pagans and\r\nMohammedans were to be driven out of Europe into Asia. To enforce this\r\nchange, an army of two hundred and seventy thousand infantry, fifty\r\nthousand cavalry, two hundred cannon, and one hundred and twenty ships\r\nof war, was deemed amply sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe first step was to secure the co-operation of two or three of the\r\nmost powerful kings of Europe. This would render success almost\r\ncertain. Sully examined the plan with the utmost care in all its\r\ndetails. Henry wished first to secure the approval of England, Sweden,\r\nand Denmark.\r\n\r\nBut, in the midst of these schemes of grandeur, Henry was struck down\r\nby the hand of an assassin. On the fourteenth of May, 1610, the king\r\nleft the Louvre at four o'clock in the afternoon to visit Sully, who\r\nwas sick. Preparations were making for the public entry of the queen,\r\nwho, after a long delay, had just been crowned. The city was thronged;\r\nthe day was fine, and the curtains of the coach were drawn up. Several\r\nnobles were in the spacious carriage with the king. As the coach was\r\nturning out of the street Honoré into the narrow street Ferronnerie,\r\nit was stopped by two carts which blocked up the way. Just at that\r\ninstant a man from the crowd sprang upon a spoke of the wheel, and\r\nstruck a dagger into the king just above the heart. Instantly\r\nrepeating the blow, the heart was pierced. Blood gushed from the wound\r\nand from the mouth of the king, and, without uttering a word, he sank\r\ndead in the arms of his friends.\r\n\r\nThe wretched assassin, a fanatic monk, was immediately seized by the\r\nguard. With difficulty they protected him from being torn to pieces by\r\nthe infuriated people. His name was Francis Ravaillac. According to\r\nthe savage custom of the times, he was subsequently put to death with\r\nthe most frightful tortures.\r\n\r\nThe lifeless body of the king was immediately taken to the Tuileries\r\nand placed upon a bed. Surgeons and physicians hurried to the room\r\nonly to gaze upon his corpse. No language can depict the grief and\r\ndespair of France at his death. He had won the love of the whole\r\nnation, and, to the present day, no one hears the name of Henry the\r\nFourth mentioned in France but with affection. He was truly the father\r\nof his people. All conditions, employments, and professions were\r\nembraced in his comprehensive regard. He spared no toil to make France\r\na happy land. He was a man of genius and of instinctive magnanimity.\r\nIn conversation he had no rival. His profound and witty sayings which\r\nhave been transmitted to us are sufficient to form a volume. His one\r\ngreat and almost only fault sadly tarnishes his otherwise fair and\r\nhonorable fame.\r\n\r\nIn Henry commenced the reign of the house of Bourbon. For nearly two\r\nhundred years the family retained the crown. It is now expelled, and\r\nthe members are wandering in exile through foreign lands.\r\n\r\nThere is one great truth which this narrative enforces: it is the\r\ndoctrine of _freedom of conscience_. It was the denial of this simple\r\ntruth which deluged France in blood and woe. The recognition of this\r\none sentiment would have saved for France hundreds of thousands of\r\nlives, and millions of treasure. Let us take warning. We need it.\r\n\r\nLet us emblazon upon our banner the noble words, \"_Toleration--perfect\r\ncivil and religious toleration_.\" But Toleration is not a slave. It is\r\na spirit of light and of liberty. It has much to give, but it has just\r\nas much to demand. It bears the olive-branch in one hand, and the\r\ngleaming sword in the other. I grant _to you_, it says, perfect\r\nliberty of opinion and of expression, and I demand _of you_ the same.\r\n\r\nLet us then inscribe upon the arch which spans our glorious Union,\r\nmaking us one in its celestial embrace, \"_Freedom of speech, freedom\r\nof the press, and free men_.\"\r\n\r\nThen shall that arch beam upon us like God's bow of promise in the\r\ncloud, proclaiming that this land shall never be deluged by the surges\r\nof civil war--that it never shall be inundated by flames and blood.\r\n\r\nThe human mind is now so roused that it will have this liberty; and if\r\nthere are any institutions of religion or of civil law which can not\r\nstand this scrutiny, they are doomed to die. The human mind will move\r\nwith untrammeled sweep through the whole range of religious doctrine,\r\nand around the whole circumference and into the very centre of all\r\npolitical assumptions.\r\n\r\nIf the Catholic bishop have a word to say, let him say it. If some\r\none, rising in the spirit and power of Martin Luther, has a reply to\r\nmake, let him make it. Those who wish to listen to the one or the\r\nother, let them do so. Those who wish to close their ears, let them\r\nhave their way.\r\n\r\nOur country is one. Our liberty is national. Let us then grant\r\ntoleration every where throughout our wide domain, in Maine and in\r\nGeorgia, amid the forests of the Aroostook and upon the plains of\r\nKansas.\r\n\r\n                         THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER'S NOTES:\r\n\r\n1.
